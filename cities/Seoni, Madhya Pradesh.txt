'''Seoni'''  is a city and a [[municipality]] in [[Seoni district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Madhya Pradesh]]. This tribal household dominated district was formed in the year 1956.

[[Rudyard Kipling]] used the forests in the vicinity of Seoni, or as was spelled during British colonial rule, '''Seeonee''', as the setting for the [[Mowgli]] stories in ''[[The Jungle Book]]'' and ''[[The Second Jungle Book]]'' (1894–1895), although the area is not an actual [[rainforest]]. Seoni is a city where the [[Wainganga River|Wainganga]], a tributary of the river Godavari, originates.

Seoni is reachable by trains and road. Major adjacent cities are [[Nagpur]] and [[Jabalpur]]. The [[National Highway 44 (India)|National Highway 44]] north–south corridor crosses from Seoni. [[Seoni Railway Station]] serves as the primary transportation hub for Seoni district and connect Seoni city to National capital ([[New Delhi]]) and State capital ([[Bhopal]]) directly via express trains .The nearest airport is Nagpur (130&nbsp;km); a small airport (air-strip) is available at Seoni near Sukhtara village for landing charter airplanes/helicopters.

The Wainganga is a river in India originating in the Mahadeo Hills in Mundara near the village Gopalganj in Seoni, Madhya Pradesh. It is a key tributary of the Godavari. The river flows south in a winding course through the states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, roughly 579&nbsp;km (360&nbsp;mi). After joining the Wardha River, the united stream, which is known as the Pranahita River, empties into the Godavari River at Kaleshwaram, Telangana.

===Pench Tiger Reserve===
{{unsourced section|date=July 2024}}

[[File:Patdev_Pench.jpg|220x124px|thumb|right|Tiger at pench National Park]]
The River Bainganga's source is located beneath the village Mundara, where it includes for example the [[Pench Tiger Reserve]] within 10&nbsp;km.  The Pench Tiger Reserve is named after the Pench River, which flows from north to south through the reserve, and is located in the southern reaches of the Satpura hill ranges in the Seoni and Chhindwara districts in the Madhya Pradesh state of India. The terrain is undulating, with most of the area covered by small hill ranges, steeply sloping on the sides.  The Pench National Park is named after the Pench River, which flows from north to south through the park. This river constitutes the district boundary of Seoni and Chhindwara districts of Madhya Pradesh in the upper region and State boundary with Maharashtra State in the lower region. This area became the 19th tiger reserve of India in 1992.  The tourist traffic is experiencing fast growth in this park.[http://www.penchnationalparkindia.in/ Pench]
The Pench National Park which constitutes the core of the tiger reserves was notified in the year 1983. The total area of the park is 292.85&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The total area of the Pench Tiger Reserve is 757.85&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

The reserve is situated in an area that holds a significant place in the natural history of Central India. Descriptions of its flora and fauna have appeared in wildlife books dating back to the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Books written in the 19th and early 20th century by naturalists like Captain J. Forsyth and Rudyard Kipling's ''Jungle Book'' cover the panorama of nature's abundance in this tract.{{original research inline|date=April 2017}}

A forest belt extends in three directions: north, east and south, covering forest tracts of Seoni, Balaghat and Nagpur districts. The contiguous forest on the southern side in the Maharashtra state of India, initially named Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru National Park has been recently included in the Project Tiger network under the same name as this reserve. A dam was constructed on the Pench River on south-eastern boundary of the reserve.

The area is criss-crossed by numerous seasonal streams and "nalas". The Pench River flowing through the central line of the reserve is dry by the end of April but a number of water pools locally known locally as "dohs" are found, which serve as waterholes for wild animals. A few perennial springs also exist in this area. However, the water sources are not suitably distributed, hence large area remains unused by the wild animals. The Pench reservoir at the center of the reserve is the only major water source during pinch period.

As the prey concentration is high along the Pench River, tigers usually inhabit this belt. Leopards, though, generally operate in the peripheral areas but are occasionally seen in deep forests also. Jungle cats are commonly seen. Leopard cats, [[small Indian civet]] and [[palm civet]]{{specify|reason=which species?|date=January 2023}} are common but seen very rarely.

Wild dogs are commonly seen in packs of 12 to 15, near Chhedia, Jamtara, Bodanala and Pyorthadi areas of the reserve. Wild boars are ubiquitous. [[Sloth bear]]s occupy the hilly, rocky outcrops and favour [[Phanera vahlii|mahul bel]]-infested forest. [[Chinkara]] are present in very small numbers and are found in open areas around Turia, Telia, and Dudhgaon villages. Jackals are seen occasionally near Tekadi, Alikatta and Chhindimatta villages.

===Bheemgarh Dam===
[[Bheemgarh Dam]], also known as Sanjay Sarovar Bandh and Upper Wainganga dam, is built Across the Wainganga river in Chhapara tehsil of Seoni district of Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.
The Bhimgarh Sanjay Sarovar Dam is located 43&nbsp;km away from the Seoni. It is known as the biggest Mud / Earthen dam of Asia.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}} It is bounded by mountains from all sides.

===Amodagarh===
Amodagarh is a place offered by Seoni tourism to its visitors.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} It is supposed that this place was the work place of "[[Mowgli]]" of author Rudyard Kipling's book "[[The Jungle Book]]". This place is situated on the Seoni-Mandla state highway. From Amodagarh tourists can see the remains of the palace of Sona Rani. The place has a clef, a hilly nalla with exposed rocks. This place is visited before sunset as forest animals come out. The place lies at a distance of approximately 10 kilometres from Chhui and about 32 kilometres from Seoni. Importance of this place increased as it has fair chances of a place of Mugli (as pronounced) due to existence of village "Ugly" at the other end of this forest in Seoni district.

===Matradham===
There is a village 15&nbsp;km west in the Seoni district of "Katalbodi" also known as '''Matradham'''. The Hindu guru Shankara Acharya constructed a Shiv Temple here in 2003 in honour of the birthplace of his mother.
