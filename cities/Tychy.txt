'''Tychy''' (<small>Polish pronunciation:</small> {{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Tychy.ogg|'|t|y|h|y}}; {{langx|de|Tichau}}; {{langx|szl|Tychy}}) is a city in [[Silesia]] in southern [[Poland]], approximately {{convert|20|km|mi}} south of [[Katowice]]. Situated on the southern edge of the Upper Silesian industrial district, the city borders Katowice to the north, [[Mikołów]] to the west, [[Bieruń]] to the east and [[Kobiór]] to the south. The [[Gostynia]] river, a tributary of the [[Vistula]], flows through Tychy.

Since 1999, Tychy has been located within the [[Silesian Voivodeship]], a province consisting of 71 regional towns and cities. Tychy is also one of the founding cities of the Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia, a pan-Silesian economic and political union formed with the eventual aim of bringing the most populous Silesian areas under a [[Metropolis GZM|single administrative body]].

Tychy is well known for its brewing industry and the [[Tyskie]] brand of beer, which dates back to the 17th century.<ref>[http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761558637/Tychy.html "Tychy"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050514051052/http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761558637/Tychy.html |date=2005-05-14 }}, Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2009, Retrieved 2006-07-02</ref> Since 1950, Tychy has grown rapidly, mainly as a result of post-war socialist planning policies enacted to disperse the population of industrial Upper Silesia.<ref>Duvall, C and Winstan Bond.

==History==
===Etymology===
The moniker Tychy is derived from the Polish word ''cichy'', meaning "quiet" or "still".<ref>Room, A. (2005). ''Placenames of the World''. Second Edition p. 386. McFarland and Company</ref> Although appropriate for most of Tychy's history, the name is now somewhat ironic considering the growth of the city from 1950 onwards.

===Origins and development===
Originally established as a small agricultural settlement on the medieval trade route between [[Oświęcim]] and Mikołów, Tychy was first documented in 1467.<ref name="History of Tychy">[http://www.umtychy.pl/www_4.0/artykul.php?s=405,470 Umtychy.pl]{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, "History of Tychy", Retrieved 2006-07-02</ref> In 1629 the first trace of serious economic activity was recorded in the shape of the Książęcy Brewery, which is now one of the largest breweries in Poland.<ref>[http://www.umtychy.pl/www_4.0/dodruku_artykul.php?s=410,475 Umtychy.pl]{{Dead link|date=March 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, "Monuments", Retrieved 2006-07-02</ref>

From 1526 onwards the area on which Tychy is built was part of the Austrian [[Habsburg monarchy]]. In 1742 [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] annexed the land after winning the [[First Silesian War]] against the Austrian [[Habsburg monarchy|Hasburg monarchy]]. In 1871 the territory became part of the [[German Empire]] until in 1918, for a short period between 1918 and 1921 Tychy was just inside the border of the newly formed [[Weimar Republic]] and still a part of the German [[Province of Silesia]]. On 16–17 August 1919 the {{Interlanguage link|Battle of Paprocany|pl|Bitwa o Paprocany}} (present-day district of Tychy) was fought as one of the first battles of the [[Silesian Uprisings]] (1919–1921). After the uprisings Tychy was reintegrated with the re-established [[Second Polish Republic|Polish state]]. Additionally, due to the Polish majority in 1921 in Tychy and the few Germans, 84% of the inhabitants voted for joining Poland during the plebiscite.<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/544097/Silesia Britannica.com], "Silesia", [[Encyclopædia Britannica Online]], Retrieved 2006-07-02</ref>

Shortly after its cession to Poland, Tychy began to develop into a small urban settlement, acquiring a hospital, a fire station, a post office, a school, a swimming pool, a bowling hall and a number of shops and restaurants. In 1922 it was visited by leader of interwar Poland, [[Józef Piłsudski]].<ref name=ety/> Its population also grew between World War I and World War II, reaching a population of 11,000 at its highest point during this time.<ref name="History of Tychy"/>

===New Tychy===
The "New City" was designated by the Polish government in 1950 and deliberately located near to [[Katowice]] with the intention that it would not be a self-sustaining city. It was granted [[town rights]] in 1951.<ref name=ety/> Tychy is the largest of the so-called "[[new town]]s" in Poland and was built from 1950 to 1985, to allow for urban expansion in the southeast of the [[Upper Silesian Industrial Region|Upper Silesian industrial region]]. In the 1950s the neighbourhood ''Osiedle A'' was built, designed by Tadeusz Teodorowicz-Todorowski, and the design and planning of the next neighbourhoods was entrusted to {{interlanguage link|Kazimierz Wejchert|pl}} and his wife {{interlanguage link|Hanna Adamczewska-Wejchert|pl}}.<ref name=ety/> In the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s numerous industrial enterprises were created.<ref name=ety/> In 1951 and 1973 the city limits were greatly expanded by including [[Paprocany]] and [[Wilkowyje]] (in 1951),<ref>{{Cite Polish law|title=Rozporządzenie Prezesa Rady Ministrów z dnia 8 listopada 1950 r. w sprawie nadania ustroju miejskiego niektórym gminom w województwach: katowickim i warszawskim, gromadzie Hajnówka w województwie białostockim oraz zniesienia i zmiany granic niektórych miast i gmin w województwach katowickim i białostockim.|year=1950|volume=51|number=472}}</ref> and [[Cielmice, Tychy|Cielmice]], Urbanowice, Jaroszowice (in 1973) as new districts.<ref name=ety/> By 2006, the population had reached 132,500.

In the administrative reforms which came into effect in 1999, Tychy was made a city with the status of a [[powiat]] (city county). Between 1999 and 2002, it was also the administrative seat of (but not part of) an entity called Tychy County (''powiat tyski''), which is now known as the [[Bieruń-Lędziny County]].
