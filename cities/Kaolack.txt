'''Kaolack''' ({{langx|ar|'''كاولاك'''}}; {{langx|wo|'''Kawlax'''}}) is a town with a population of 298,904 (2023 census) on the north bank of the [[Saloum River]] about {{Convert|100|km|}} from its mouth and the [[N1 road (Senegal)|N1 road]] in [[Senegal]]. It is the capital of the [[Kaolack Region]], which borders [[The Gambia]] to the south. 
Kaolack is an important regional [[market town]] and is Senegal's main [[peanut]] trading and processing center. As the center of the Ibrahimiyya branch of the [[Tijaniyyah]] [[Sufi]] order founded by [[Ibrahim Niass|Ibrayima Ñas]], it is also a major center of [[Islam]]ic education. The [[Medina Baay|Leona Niassene]] mosque (right) in Kaolack is one of the largest and best known in Senegal.

==History==
Kaolack is the successor city to [[Kahone]], historic capital of the kingdom of [[Saloum]]. Originally marked by a sacred tree on the right bank of the Saloum River facing the island of Kouyong, Kahone consisted of a number of distinct neighborhoods separated by open fields, each under the jurisdiction of a different dignitary or official. Kaolack, {{Convert|8|km|}} downriver, was one of these. 

One legend holds that it was founded by Sega and Massar, two brothers of [[Fulani]] origin from [[Macina Empire|Macina]] in today's Mali. Sega’s son, Alioune Mboutou Sow, later served as the Chef de Canton of Kaolack. The Mboutou family house still stands in the middle of the town centre. Mboutou Sow's daughter Ramatoulaye (Rahmat'oullah) was given in marriage to the son of [[Ahmadou Bamba Mbacke|Amadou Bamba]], hence the saying ''Kaolack worrou Mboutou'' (Kaolack, Mboutou's fiefdom).{{cn|date=August 2023}} An alternative telling is that Kaolack was founded by a princess of [[Baol]] who took shelter there under the protection of the [[Maad Saloum]] [[Mbegan Ndour]], whom she later married, and founded the traditional cult of the [[West African Nile monitor]], known as ''mbossé'' in [[Wolof language|Wolof]], the [[totem]] of the city. Mboutou Sow arrived later, and became chief through his erudition.<ref>{{cite book| last = Kesteloot| first = Lilyan | last2 = Veirman| first2 = Anja| author-link = | date = 1999| title = Histoire d'Afrique : les enjeux de mémoire|chapter = Un lieu de mémoire sans stèle et sans visite guidée : le culte du Mboose à Kaolack (Sénégal)| url = https://archive.org/details/histoiredafrique0000unse/page/83/mode/1up| location = Paris| publisher = Karthala| page = 83-91|language = French}}</ref>

[[France|French]] interests in the Saloum River increased in the early 19th century as legitimate articles of trade were sought to replace trade in slaves. By mid-century, peanut production had been introduced to the kingdom of Saloum and, with the permission of its king, a fortified factory was established by the French on the riverfront at Kaolack, more favorably placed for shipping than Kahone. They laid out a first grid of lots in 1860, in what would become the city center or "Escale" neighborhood. The construction of a rail spur from the port to the [[Dakar–Niger Railway|Dakar-Niger line]] in 1911 caused the town to boom as a peanut processing and export center. Its population grew rapidly, rising from 5,600 in 1925 to 44,000 in 1934.{{cn|date=August 2023}}

It is at this time that Kaolack became an important center for the [[Tijaniyyah]] Sufi order, with {{ill|Allaaji Abdulaay Ñas|fr|Abdoulaye Niasse}} opening a first major zâwiyah, or “lodge”, in the Leona neighborhood in 1910.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Salm |first1=Steven J. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBj3HTJ3wJ4C&dq=Kaolack+1930&pg=PA256 |title=African Urban Spaces in Historical Perspective |last2=Falola |first2=Toyin |date=2005 |publisher=University Rochester Press |isbn=978-1-58046-314-0 |page=256 |language=en}}</ref> His son [[Ibrahim Niass]] moved the community, known as the Jamāʿat al-fayḍa ({{Lit|The Community of the Divine Flood|i=yes|lk=yes}}), to a new suburb of Kaolack called Madina Baye in the early 1930s, now a part of the city itself.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wright |first=Zachary Valentine |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2h2oBgAAQBAJ&dq=Kaolack+1930&pg=PA3 |title=Living Knowledge in West African Islam: The Sufi Community of Ibrāhīm Niasse |date=2015-02-04 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-28946-8 |page=3 |language=en}}</ref>

Today, there is a peanut oil processing plant with its own port facilities in the downstream suburb of Lyndiane, while salt pans across the Saloum river constitute the city’s only other major industrial activity.

==Neighbourhoods==
Among Kaolack's many neighbourhoods are:

*'''Lewna''' ('''Léona''' in French), which includes much of the city center. It includes '''Lewna Ñaseen''' ('''Léona Niassène''' in French), the headquarters of the branch of the Tijānī Islamic order founded in 1910 by {{ill|Allaaji Abdulaay Ñas|fr|Abdoulaye Niasse}} after his exile in [[Gambia]]. But now the Tijānī Islamic Order is held by the eldest son of Mame Khalifa who was the oldest son of Allaji Abdoulaye Niass .
*'''Jaleñ''' ('''Dialègne''' in French), between Lewna Ñaseen and Medina Mbàbba.
*'''Medina Mbàbba''' ('''Médina Mbaba''' in French), also called "Medina I", named after Baabakar Njaay, nicknamed "Mbàbba Njaay," who was the [[Serer people|Serer]] chief of the village when it was incorporated into Kaolack.
*'''Medina Baay''' ('''Médina Baye''' in French), also called "Medina II", on the northeast edge of the city. It is the center of the Ibrāhīmiiya branch of the Tijānī order founded in 1930 by Allaaji Abdulaay Ñas's son, [[Ibrahim Niass|Ibrayima Ñas]], known to his followers as "Baay" ("Father" in Wolof). The name in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] means "The City of Baay."  
*'''Saam''' ('''Sam''' in French), west of Medina Baay in the north of Kaolack, also founded by Ibrayima Ñas. Saam was originally designated as the fields and orchards of Ibrayima Ñas's disciples, but since the 1970s the trees have been replaced by houses.
* '''Ndoorong''' ('''Ndorong''' in French), west of Saam, founded by Bashiru Mbàkke and his [[Mouride|Murid]] disciples.
* '''Coofog''' ('''Thiofoke''' in French), north of Saam, which existed before Kaolack as a Serer village ruled by the [[Guelowar]] dynasty.
