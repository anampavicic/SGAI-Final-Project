==History==
[[Ageo-shuku]], a [[shukuba|post town]] on the [[Nakasendō]] highway flourished during the [[Edo period]]. Ageo's rail station opened in 1883. In 1889, Ageo-juku merged with the hamlets of Ageoshimo, Kashiwaza, Kasugayatsu and Yatsu to form the town of Ageo with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The two towns of Hirakata and Haraichi and the three villages of Kamihira, Ōishi and Ōya merged with the town of Ageo on January 1, 1955, which was elevated city status on July 15, 1958. In the 1960s, four large-scale public housing complexes were established, forming [[new town]] developments which greatly expanded the city's population. A proposal to merge with the neighboring city of Saitama was rejected by referendum in 2001.

==Government==
Ageo has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 30 members. Ageo, together with the town of Ina, contributes three members to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Saitama 6th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Ageo was a noted agricultural area well into the 20th century, and various vegetables were cultivated. Agricultural land in the city area is declining, but in addition to pears, grapes and kiwis, various items such as tomatoes, cucumbers and spinach are produced. In the second half of the 20th century, numerous metallurgical and automobile factories were constructed, and [[UD Trucks]] and Bridgestone Cycle remain major employers. Due to its geographic location, Ageo is increasingly becoming a [[bedroom community]] for Saitama City and Tokyo.

==Education==
*[[Seigakuin University]]
* Ageo has 22 public elementary schools and 11 public middle schools operated by the city government, and four public high schools operated by the Saitama Prefectural Board of Education. In addition, there is one private high school. The prefecture also operates two special education schools for the handicapped.
