Benin originally had six administrative regions (''départements''), which have now been bifurcated to make 12. Each of the deconcentrated administrative services (''directions départementales'') of the sectoral ministries takes care of two administrative regions. A law passed in 1999 transformed the ''sous-prefectures'', the lowest level of territorial administration, into local governments.<ref name=UN>{{cite report|url=http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/un/unpan023250.pdf|page=8|title=Republic of Benin, Public Administration and Country profile|access-date=17 November 2016|publisher=Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA), United Nations|year=2004}}</ref> Municipalities and communal councils have elected representatives who manage the administration of the regions. The latest elections of the municipal and communal councils were held in June 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Local elections in Benin, 2015|url=http://africanelections.org/new_news.php?nid=1189|publisher=African Elections Database|access-date=25 November 2016}}</ref>
