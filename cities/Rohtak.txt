Clay mounds of coins discovered at [[Khokhrakot]] have thrown light on the process of casting coins in [[ancient India]].{{sfn|Vyas|1995|p=67}} Dating to the 3rd or 4th century CE, a large number of coin moulds from the [[Yaudheya]]s reign have been unearthed from Khokhrakot, alongside various clay seals from that period and beyond. 4th to 6th century CE, [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]] terracotta plaque and a head from later era have also been discovered at Khokhrakot archaeological site at Rohtak.

The 4th-century CE astronomical text [[Surya Siddhanta]] described a spherical Earth with a [[prime meridian]] running between Avanti (Ujjain) and Rohitaka (Rohtak), while localities used their own time based on the local [[Panchang]] calendar.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chopra |first1=Sanjeev |date=21 May 2024 |title=The IST story—How Indian Railways, and Sardar Patel, helped synchronise India's clocks |url=https://theprint.in/opinion/the-ist-story-how-indian-railways-and-sardar-patel-helped-synchronise-indias-clocks/2093981/ |work=ThePrint |access-date=27 July 2024}}</ref>

A seventh century CE statue of [[Parshvanatha]], twenty-third [[Jain]] [[tirthankara]], was found in the [[Asthal Bohar]] village.{{sfn|Vyas|1995|pp=67-68}}

Ninth century jain sources, like the [[Vipakasutra]], reveal the prominence of the Jain deity Parshvanatha and his protector [[Dharanendra]] in Rohtak around this time.{{sfn|Vyas|1995|p=67}} The [[Vipakasutra]] is one of twelve ancient texts of [[Śvetāmbara]] [[Jainism]], written around ninth century CE, as a kingdom of kings [[Vasavadatta|Vesamanadatta]] and [[Pusyanandi]].{{sfn|Vyas|1995|p=67}} 

The town continued to flourish till the 10th century CE, as coins of [[Hindu Shahi#Samanta|King Samanta Deva]] of the [[Hindu Shahi]] have been found here. The town was conquered by the [[Ghaznavids]] under [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] between 1020-1030.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.reference.com/browse/rohtak |title=Archived copy |access-date=29 January 2015 |archive-date=29 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129123633/http://www.reference.com/browse/rohtak |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Third Battle of Panipat in 1761 ===

According to Rao Uttam Singh from Sangrur, Keshavdas Pardhan, who may be an ancestor of the Vachhas family of Rohtak, was stationed at [[Kotputli]] during the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] leading [[Maratha empire|Maratha forces]] under a [[Peshwa]] general. His duties involved managing supplies, maintaining vigilance, and reporting enemy movements. After the Panipat defeat, Keshavdas and his cousin Bhajan settled in [[Charkhi Dadri|Dadri]]. [[Hindu genealogy registers at Haridwar|Records]] from the Pandas of [[Garhmukteshwar]] suggest his descendants' prominent status. These descendants are identified as [[Gaur Brahmins]] with [[Vats (clan)|Vatsa]] [[gotra]].<ref name="Marathas And Panipat" >{{cite book |author= Hari Ram Gupta |title=Marathas And Panipat |date=1961 |publisher=panjab University

=== Rainfall ===
Annual rainfall of the district is about 58&nbsp;cm. The rainfall is unevenly distributed and decreases from south east to south west. About 80% of the total rainfall is received during the rainy season, which lasts from July to September. Some rainfall is received from western disturbances during the winter season. Due to the low rainfall and its short duration, agricultural activities are mostly dependent upon canal irrigation and tubewells.<ref name="rohtak.nic.in">{{cite web |url=http://rohtak.nic.in/study_area.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006081006/http://rohtak.nic.in/study_area.htm |archive-date=6 October 2011 |title=District Administration Rohtak}}</ref>

=== Hydrology ===
The development of the area largely depends over the quality as well as quantity of ground water. As far as Rohtak District is concerned ground water occurs in semi-confined to unconfined aquifers. The unconfined aquifers are tapped by dugwells. While the semi-confined aquifers are tapped by shallow tubewells which are 22,000 in number.<ref name="rohtak.nic.in"/>

The growth rate of urban population in the zone has been above 60 per cent, the highest among all the constituents of National Capital Region. These urban centres face a rapid growth in population as the workforce travels to work from here to the Capital.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/other-states/haryana-govt-seeks-special-financial-package-this-budget/article6730303.ece|title=Haryana Govt. seeks special financial package this Budget|first=Ashok|last=Kumar|date=27 December 2014|via=www.thehindu.com|newspaper=The Hindu}}</ref>

=== Healthcare ===
The city hosts the Pandit Bhagwat Dayal Sharma Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences and Civil Hospital, both of which are operated by the state government. There are also various privately operated medical facilities.
Pt B.D.Sharma, PGIMS, Rohtak has situated at a distance of about 240&nbsp; km from Chandigarh and about 70&nbsp; km from Delhi on Delhi-Hissar-Sirsa-Fazilka National Highway (NH-10). It is the only major Institution for Medical Education and Research and a tertiary care centre for provision of specialised health care services not only to the people of the State of Haryana, but also to those from Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi and western U.P.  The Institute was started under the name of Medical College, Rohtak in the year 1960.  For the first three years, the students were admitted to Medical College, Patiala which acted as a host Institution.  In 1963, the students were shifted to Rohtak.  In the subsequent years, multifaceted expansion measures have transformed the Institute into a fully developed centre of Medical Education and research in all the major disciplines of Medicine.  In the year 1994, Medical College, Rohtak was renamed as Pt. B.D.Sharma, Medical College, Rohtak and subsequently, it was upgraded to a Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences in the year 1995.  Today Pt. B.D.Sharma, PGIMS, Rohtak is a famous institution not only for medical education but also for the healthcare facilities both at the National as well as International level.

The institute has a remarkably well-developed campus spread over an area of 350 acres of land. During the 50 years of its existence, Pt. B.D.Sharma, PGIMS, Rohtak has witnessed a phenomenal growth achieving not only its designated goals but also in expanding its horizons to set newer objectives completely commensurable with the requirements of the National goal of “Health for all by 2020”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pgimsrohtak.nic.in/intro.htm|title=PT.BHAGWAT DAYAL SHARMA POST GRADUATE INSTITUTE OF MEDICAL SCIENCES, ROHTAK|website=pgimsrohtak.nic.in|access-date=22 January 2015|archive-date=18 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118074623/http://pgimsrohtak.nic.in/intro.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Political controversy===
The development of Rohtak caused controversy in 2013 as a result of the allegedly disproportionate number of state development projects that have been awarded to the city by Chief Minister [[Bhupinder Singh Hooda]], who was born in a nearby village. This has led to severe criticism by both the opposition parties and some members of the governing [[Indian National Congress]] party, who have attacked Hooda for bias.<ref name="tehelka1">{{cite news |url=http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main52.asp?filename=Fw020512Rohtak.asp |title=Rohtak develops with Haryana CM's bounty |first=Neeraj |last=Mohan |publisher=Tehelka |access-date=16 June 2013 |archive-date=3 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603075244/http://archive.tehelka.com/story_main52.asp?filename=Fw020512Rohtak.asp |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Rao Inderjit Singh]], a BJP leader from [[South Haryana]], used [[Right to Information]] requests to determine that from a total of 5,135 announcements of schemes in the state, 2,045 went to the three districts of Rohtak, [[Jhajjar]] and [[Sonepat]].
