The prefecture's population was 4,153,500 as of 2023 census,<ref name="citypopulation.de">{{cite web | url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/china/admin/ | title=China: Administrative Division (Provinces and Prefectures) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map }}</ref> including 2,519,051 in the built-up area made of five urban districts.

==Geography== 
[[File:Txu-oclc-10552568-ng49-13.jpg|thumb|left|Map including Liuzhou (labeled as LIU-CHOU (LIUCHOW) {{lang|zh|柳州}}) ([[Army Map Service|AMS]], 1954)]]
Liuzhou is located on the banks of the winding [[Liu River]], approximately {{convert|255|km|abbr=on}} from [[Nanning]], the regional capital. By road, it is about {{convert|167|km|abbr=on}} to [[Guilin]], {{convert|167|km|abbr=on}} to [[Hechi]], {{convert|237|km|abbr=on}} to [[Nanning]], {{convert|373|km|abbr=on}} to [[Fangchenggang]], {{convert|448|km|abbr=on}} to [[Beihai]].

Swimming in the river is a tradition of the city. The river is normally green, but sometimes in summer, floods from the mountain areas upstream bring sediment which colors the water yellow. In early 2012, a cadmium spill upstream caused serious pollution worries.<ref name=danwei>http://www.danwei.com/panic-buying-of-water-in-liuzhou-a-report-from-the-ground/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509015209/http://www.danwei.com/panic-buying-of-water-in-liuzhou-a-report-from-the-ground/ |date=2012-05-09 }} Panic buying of water in Liuzhou – a report from the ground</ref>

The river can be deep.  Normally, the depth is {{convert|60|-|70|m|ft}} but can as deep as {{convert|90|m|ft}} before it floods over the wall. In 2000 a bus, with 78 passengers, fell over the side of a bridge. There were no survivors.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20200924233855/http://liuzhou.co.uk/wordpress/2014/09/06/liuzhou-bridges-6-hudong-bridge/// Liuzhou Bridges 6 – Hudong Bridge |date=2014-09-06]</ref>

Liuzhou has a history of more than 2,100 years. The city was founded in 111 B.C. when it was known as '''Tanzhong''' ({{zh|labels=no |c={{linktext|潭中}} |l="Center of Deep Pool"}}).

In 742 A.D. it became known as '''Longcheng''' ({{zh|labels=no |s={{linktext|龙城}} |l="Dragon City"}}), after the [[Long River (Guangxi)|Long River]], before finally changing to Liuzhou ({{zh|labels=no |c={{linktext|柳州}} |l="Willow [[zhou (administrative division)|Prefecture]]"}}) after the [[Liu River]] in 1736.

The most famous historic figure is [[Liu Zongyuan]] (773&ndash;819), who was a poet and politician in the [[Tang dynasty]] and who died in Liuzhou. He is commemorated by a park in the city.

Liuzhou was the site of [[Liuchow Airfield]], used by Nationalist Chinese and [[United States Army Air Forces|American Army Air Forces]] in [[World War II]].<ref name="Hump">''Hump Express'', Vol. 1, 25.

==Economy==
{{wide image|1948年柳州.jpg|1200px|align-cap=center|Liuzhou city center in 1948}}
Liuzhou is the second largest city in Guangxi and is the region's industrial center. According to statistics issued by the Liuzhou government in 2015, the city's GDP was 231.1 billion yuan.<ref name=hktdc>http://www.hktdc.com/info/mi/a/mpcn/en/1X072H6F/1/Profiles-Of-China-Provinces-Cities-And-Industrial-Parks/Liuzhou-Guangxi-City-Information.htm Liuzhou ( Guangxi ) City Information</ref>

Among important companies based in Liuzhou are:

*[[LiuGong]] - a multinational construction machinery manufacturer
*[[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile]] - a joint venture between [[General Motors]], [[SAIC Motor]] and Liuzhou [[Wuling Motors]]

==Tourism==
[[File:Liuzhou City seen from Ma'an Mountain.jpg|thumb|Liuzhou city seen from Ma'an Mountain in 2022]]
As with much of Guangxi, the landscape around Liuzhou is a mix of rolling hills, mountain peaks, caves and [[karst]] scenery. It is an ideal base for exploring the minority villages in the area.
*'''Rongshui:'''  [[Rongshui Miao Autonomous County]] is located in the north of Liuzhou prefecture, {{convert|118|km|abbr=on}} away from Liuzhou and {{convert|168|km|abbr=on}} from Guilin. The territory is inhabited by Miao, Yao, Dong, Zhuang and Han ethnic groups.
*'''Dayaoshan'''  scenic area is in Jinxiu Yao Autonomous County, {{convert|154|km|abbr=on}} from the city of Liuzhou. It has a scenic area of over {{convert|500|km2|abbr=on}}.
*'''Sanjiang:'''  [[Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County]] lies to the north of Liuzhou near the Hunan border. It is a Dong minority area and is surrounded by picturesque ethnic minority villages.
*LiuZhou Industrial Museum ({{lang|zh|柳州工业博物馆}}) was set up on the original site of the former Cotton Textile Factory No.3, and opened in 2012.

In recent years (post-[[Covid-19 pandemic]], 2022/3) some tourists engage in [[Culinary tourism]] since Liuzhou is the birthplace of Guangxi's most famous dish, [[Luosifen]].

==Transport==
[[File:Liuzhou Railway Station (20190420171106).jpg|thumb|[[Liuzhou railway station]]]]
*[[Liuzhou Bailian Airport]] provides flights to major cities in China.
*Liuzhou has extensive rail connections with the rest of China. [[Hunan-Guangxi Railway]] ([[Hengyang]] - [[Pingxiang, Guangxi|Pingxiang]], a.k.a. Xiang-Gui Line), [[Jiaozuo-Liuzhou Railway]] ([[Jiaozuo]] - [[Zhicheng]] - Liuzhou, a.k.a. Jiao-Liu Line) Railway and Guizhou-Guangxi Railway ([[Guiyang]] - Liuzhou, a.k.a. Qian-Gui Line) make Liuzhou the center of freight transportation in Guangxi.
*[[China National Highway 209]]
*[[Liuzhou-Wuzhou Railway]] is a newly released railway line, linking the cities of '''Liuzhou''' with [[Wuzhou]].

== Military ==
Liuzhou is the headquarters of the [[41st Army (People's Republic of China)|41st Group Army]] of the [[People's Liberation Army]], one of the two army groups that comprise the [[Guangzhou Military Region]] responsible for the defence of China's southern coast and its border with [[Vietnam]].

==Quotes==
Liuzhou appears in the Chinese saying {{lang|zh-Hans|生在苏州, 活在杭州, 吃在广州, 死在柳州}}.
:''Born in [[Suzhou]], live in [[Hangzhou]], eat in [[Guangzhou]], die in Liuzhou''
because, in the past, the city was known for its coffins, made from firwood, camphor wood, and sandalwood,<ref name=ThingsChinese>Du Feibao, Du Bai, Lin Nianpei; ''Things Chinese'', China Travel and Tourism Press, 2002, {{ISBN|7-5032-1856-8}}</ref> which are said to preserve the body after death. [[Guangzhou]]'s [[Cantonese cuisine|"Cantonese" cuisine]] is famous worldwide, and [[Hangzhou]] is known for its prosperity and the beauty of its location. [[Suzhou]] is reputed to have the most beautiful people in China, so the line is sometimes given as "''Marry in Suzhou''...".

Today many tourists buy miniature coffins, about {{convert|3|to|30|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, as souvenirs or good luck charms. The coffins are usually inscribed {{lang|zh-Hans|升官发财}} ({{zh|labels=no|p=shēng guān fā cái}}) which means 'get promotion and get rich". The second and fourth characters are [[homophone]]s of {{lang|zh|棺材}} ({{zh|labels=no|p=guāncái}}) meaning 'coffin'.

Some miniature coffins are used as caskets to hold the ashes of ancestors.<ref name=ThingsChinese/>

==Notable people==
*Liuzhou was the home of [[Li Ning]] (born 1963), [[gymnast]] and entrepreneur who lit the Olympic torch in [[2008 Summer Olympics|Beijing in 2008]].
*Chinese gymnast, [[Jiang Yuyuan]].
