'''Gujranwala''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] / {{langx|ur|{{nq|گوجرانوالہ}}}}; {{IPA|ur|ɡʊd͡ʒᵊɾãːʋaːlaː|pron}}) is a city and capital of [[Gujranwala Division]] located in [[Pakistan]]. It is also known as "City of Wrestlers" and is quite famous for its food.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dailythepatriot.com/gujranwala-the-city-of-wrestlers/|title=Gujranwala- The City of Wrestlers|website=Daily The Patriot|date=4 February 2016|access-date=2019-09-07}}</ref> It is the 5th most populous [[List of most populous cities in Pakistan|city proper]] after [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Faisalabad]] and [[Rawalpindi]] respectively. Founded in the 18th century, Gujranwala is a relatively modern town compared to the many nearby millennia-old cities of northern Punjab. The city served as the capital of the [[Sukerchakia Misl]] state between 1763 and 1799, and is the birthplace of the founder of the [[Sikh Empire]], Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]].

Gujranwala is now Pakistan's third largest industrial centre after [[Karachi]] and [[Faisalabad]],<ref name="Naz"/> and contributes 5% to 9% of Pakistan's national [[GDP]].<ref name=PAAG/> The city is part of a network of large urban centres in north-east Punjab province that forms one of Pakistan's mostly highly industrialized regions.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Azhar|first1=Annus|last2=Adil|first2=Shahid|title=Effect of Agglomeration on Socio-Economic Outcomes: A District Level Panel study of Punjab|url=http://www.pide.org.pk/psde/pdf/AGM32/papers/Effect%20of%20Agglomeration%20on%20Socio-Economic%20Outcomes.pdf|publisher=Pakistan Institute of Developmental Economics|access-date=2 June 2017}}</ref> Along with the nearby cities of [[Sialkot]] and [[Gujrat, Pakistan|Gujrat]], Gujranwala forms part of the so-called "Golden Triangle" of industrial cities with export-oriented economies.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P5pvAwAAQBAJ&q=sialkot+gujranwala+gujrat+golden+triangle&pg=PA2|title=An assessment of industrial employment skill gaps among university graduates: In the Gujrat-Sialkot-Gujranwala industrial cluster, Pakistan|last1=Mehmood|first1=Mirza, Faisal|last2=Ali|first2=Jaffri, Atif|last3=Saim|first3=Hashmi, Muhammad|date=2014-04-21|publisher=Intl Food Policy Res Inst|pages=2}}</ref><ref name="Naz"/>

==Etymology==
Gujranwala's name means "Abode of the [[Gujjar]]s" in Punjabi, and was named after the Gujjar tribe that live in northern Punjab.<ref name="IGI">{{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V12_369.gif|title=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 12, page 363 -- Imperial Gazetteer of India -- Digital South Asia Library|website=dsal.uchicago.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The History and Culture of the Indian People: The classical age |author=Ramesh Chandra Majumdar |author2=Bhāratīya Itihāsa Samiti |publisher=G.

==History==
===Founding===
Gujranwala was founded by [[Gurjar]]s in the eighteenth century<ref name="dawn/22march2021">{{cite news |last1=Mahmood |first1=Amjad |title=The importance of Gujranwala |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/1613809/the-importance-of-gujranwala |access-date=22 March 2021 |newspaper=Dawn|location=Pakistan |date=22 March 2021}}</ref> however the exact origins of Gujranwala are unclear. Unlike the ancient nearby cities of [[Sialkot]] and [[Lahore]], Gujranwala is a relatively modern city. It may have been established as a village in the middle of the 16th century.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gazetteer of the Gujranwala District, 1883-4.|year=1895|publisher=Punjab Govt.|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.281430|access-date=22 December 2017}}</ref> Locals traditionally believe that Gujranwala's original name was Khanpur Sansi, though recent scholarship suggests that the village was possibly Serai Gujran instead – a village once located near what is now Gujranwala's Khiyali Gate that was mentioned by several sources during the 18th-century invasion of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]].<ref name="Naz"/>

In 1707, with the death of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Aurangzeb]], Mughal power began to rapidly weaken especially following [[Nader Shah's invasion of India|Nader Shah's]] invasion in 1739 and then completely dissipated from the Punjab region due to the invasions of [[Ahmad Shah Durrani|Ahmad Shah Abdali]] who raided Punjab many times between 1747 and 1772 causing much devastation and chaos.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author">{{Cite book|last=Gandhi, Rajmohan, author.|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1056472770|title=Punjab : a history from Aurangzeb to Mountbatten|date=16 September 2015|isbn=978-93-83064-08-3|oclc=1056472770}}</ref>

Abdali's control over the region began to weaken in the latter part of the 18th century with the rise of the [[Sikh Misls]] (independent chieftainships usually consisting of the chief's kinsmen) who overran Punjab.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/> [[Charat Singh]], ruler of the [[Sukerchakia Misl]], established himself in a fort which he had built in the area of Gujranwala between 1756 and 1758.<ref name="Naz"/>

Nuruddin, a Jammu-based Afghan (Pashtun) general, was ordered by Abdali to subdue the Sikhs but was driven back at Sialkot by Sikh soldiers led by Charat Singh.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/> In 1761, Khwaja Abed Khan, Abdali's governor in Lahore, tried to besiege Charat Singh's base in Gujranwala but the bid misfired. The Sikh misls rallied to his support by attacking Afghan officers wherever they were found.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/> A fleeing Abed Khan was pursued by Sikh contingents led by the Ahluwalia misl into Lahore, where he was killed.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/> Charat Singh made Gujranwala the capital of his misl in 1763.<ref name="Naz" /><ref name="TSA" />

In a 1774 battle waged in Jammu, Charat Singh of the Sukerchakia misl and Jhanda Singh of the powerful Bhangi misl, fighting on opposite sides, were both killed.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/> Before his death, Charat Singh had become master of large and contiguous territories in the three doabs between the Indus and the Ravi. He was succeeded by his son [[Maha Singh]] who added to the lands that Charat Singh had not only captured but also capably administered.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/>

In the Gujranwala area in the 1770s, the Jat Chathas of Wazirabad and Rajput Bhattis of Hafizabad (Muslims in both cases) offered 'fierce resistance' to the Sukerchakias, whose attack was aided by Sahib Singh of the Bhangi misl.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/> Describing the conflict, the (British) writer of the Gujranwala Gazetteer wrote that besieged for weeks in his fortress, Ghulam Muhammad Chatha eventually surrendered after Maha Singh assured him safe passage to Mecca, but the promise was 'basely broken' when Ghulam Muhammad was shot and his fortress razed to the ground.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/> Rasoolnagar (Prophet's city) which belonged to the Chathas was renamed Ramnagar (Ram's city) to humiliate the Muslims.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/> The Gazetteer noted that the treacherous killing of Chatha and his resistance was remembered 'in many a local ballad' in Gujranwala.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/> The Bhattis of Hafizabad tehsil, who were Muslim Rajputs, did not cease their resistance to the Sukerchakias until 1801 when their leaders were killed and their possessions captured.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/> Some Bhattis fled to Jhang.<ref name="Gandhi, Rajmohan, author"/>

[[Ranjit Singh]], Maha Singh's son and successor who would later go on to establish the [[Sikh Empire]], was born in 1780 in Gujranwala's Purani Mandi market.<ref name="TSA">{{cite news|last1=Minhas|first1=Salman|title=Gujranwala – its people and tradition of light industry|url=http://www.the-south-asian.com/feb2004/gujranwala_.htm|access-date=22 December 2017|agency=The South Asian|date=2004}}</ref> Ranjit Singh maintained Gujranwala as his capital initially after rising to power in 1792. His most famous military commander [[Hari Singh Nalwa]], who was also from Gujranwala, built a high mud wall around Gujranwala during this era and established the city's new grid street-plan that exists until the present day.<ref name="Naz" /> Gujranwala remained Ranjit Singh's capital until he captured [[Lahore]] from the Durrani Afghans in 1799, at which point the capital was moved there, leading to the relative decline of Gujranwala in favour of Lahore.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Gujranwala|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Gujranwala|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=21 December 2017}}</ref>[[Jind Kaur]], the last queen of Ranjit Singh and mother of [[Duleep Singh]], was born in Gujranwala in 1817.<ref name="bansal">{{cite book|last1=Bansal|first1=Bobby|title=Remnants of the Sikh Empire: Historical Sikh Monuments in India & Pakistan|date=2015|publisher=Hay House, Inc|isbn=978-9384544935}}</ref>

By 1839, the city's bazaars were home to an estimated 500 shops, while the city had been surrounded by a number of pleasure gardens, including one established by Hari Nalwa Singh that was famous for its vast array of exotic plants.<ref name="Naz"/>

[[Christian mission]]aries were brought to the region during British colonial rule, and Gujranwala became home to numerous churches and schools.<ref name="Naz"/> The city's first [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian Church]] was established in 1875 in the Civil Lines area – a settlement built one mile north of the old city to house Gujranwala's European population.

The [[Pakistan Railways|North-Western Railway]] connected Gujranwala with other cities in British India by rail in 1881.<ref name="IGI"/> The major Sikh higher learning institution, [[Gujranwala Guru Nanak Khalsa College]], was founded in Gujranwala in 1889, though it later shifted to [[Ludhiana]].<ref name="Naz"/> The nearby [[Khanki Headworks]] were completed in 1892 under British rule, and helped irrigate 3 million acres in the province. Gujranwala's population, according to the 1901 census of British India, was 29,224.<ref name="IGI"/> The city continued to grow rapidly for the remainder of British rule.

Riots erupted in Gujranwala following the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]] in [[Amritsar]] in April 1919. These were some of most violent riots in response to the massacre in all of [[British India]].<ref name="Naz"/> Riots lead to the damage of the city's railway station and burning of the city's Tehsil Office, Clock Tower, Dak Bangla and city courts.<ref name="Naz"/> Much of the city's historical record was burnt in the attacked offices.<ref name="Naz"/> Protestors in the city, nearby villages, and a procession from Dhullay were fired upon with machine-guns mounted to low-flying planes, and subjected to aerial bombardment from the [[Royal Air Force]] under the control of [[Reginald Edward Harry Dyer]].<ref name="Naz"/><ref>{{cite book|last1=Qutubuddin Aziz|title=Jinnah and Pakistan|date=2001|publisher=Islamic Media Corporation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wluAAAAMAAJ&q=gujranwala+april+14+1919|access-date=22 December 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Sarkar|first1=Rasul Pura, Islam Pura and Rehamn PuraSumit|title=Modern India 1885–1947|date=1989|publisher=Springer|isbn=1349197122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kOawCwAAQBAJ&q=gujranwala+april+14+1919|access-date=22 December 2017}}</ref>

==Geography==
Gujranwala sits at the heart of the [[Rechna Doab]], a strip of land between the [[Chenab]] in the north, and [[Ravi River]] in the south. Gujranwala is also part of the [[Majha]], a historical region of northern Punjab. The city was built upon the plains of Punjab, and the surrounding region is an unbroken plain devoid of topographical diversity.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ball|first1=W.E.|title=Report on the Revision of the Land Revenue Settlement of the Gujranwala District|date=1874|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K9KZmQWXtwkC&q=gujranwala&pg=PA8|access-date=22 December 2017}}</ref>
[[File:Punjabdoabs1.jpg|thumb|Gujranwala is in the [[Rechna Doab]] region of Punjab, marked in grey.]]

Gujranwala is 226 metres (744&nbsp;ft) above sea level, sharing borders with [[Ghakhar Mandi]] and several towns and villages. About {{convert|80|km}} south is the provincial capital, [[Lahore]]. [[Sialkot]] and [[Gujrat, Pakistan|Gujrat]] lie to its north. Gujrat connects Gujranwala with [[Bhimber]], [[Azad Kashmir]], and Sialkot connects it with Jammu. About {{convert|160|km}} southwest is [[Faisalabad]]. To its west are Hafizabad and Pindi Bhattian, which connect Gujranwala to [[Jhang]], [[Chiniot]] and [[Sargodha]].

===Climate===
Gujranwala has a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (BSh),<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{cite web|title=Climate: Gujranwala&nbsp;– Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/1077/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|access-date=7 September 2013}}</ref> according to the [[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen-Geiger system]], and changes throughout the year.

Gujranwala's oldest precincts were laid according to the new city plan devised by [[Hari Singh Nalwa]], following Ranjit Singh's establishment of Gujranwala as his capital in 1792. A street plan based mostly on a grid plan was implemented, with bazaars intersecting one another at 90-degree angles. Some of the blocks are rectangular in shape, resulting in a polygonal shaped old city. This old city was then enclosed by a high mud wall with gates and a fort that was built immediately north of the old city. The city's Sheranwala Bagh was also expanded under Hari Singh Nalwa's direction.<ref name="Naz" />

Gujranwala's old city is centred on the ''Shahi'' (Royal) Bazaar. The old city is home to many of the city's pre-Partition houses of worship for Hindus and Sikhs. The Hindu Devi Talab temple was once famous for its large water-tank, and remains in good condition despite being used as a residence for a family who fled [[Patiala]].<ref name="zrj">{{cite journal|last1=Jatt|first1=Zahida Rehman|title=Exploring Tourism Opportunities: Documentation of the Use of Spaces of the Pre- Partitioned Temples and Gurudwaras in Punjab, Pakistan|journal=Chitrolekha International Magazine on Art and Design|date=December 2015|volume=5|issue=2|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313797955|access-date=22 December 2017|issn=2231-4822}}</ref> The Sikh [[Gurdwara]] Damdama Sahib is located near the Devi Talab Temple, is important in Sikhism for its association with Baba Sahib Singh Bedi, a Sikh saint.<ref name="zrj" /> An old gurdwara is also located near the Chashma Chowk intersection near Shahi Bazaar.<ref name="zrj" />

Gujranwala was also home to a Jain community, called [[Bhabra]] in Punjab. In the heart of the town, Lala Mubdas Jain Mandir is present. The [[samadhi]] of Jain Acharya Atmaramji (also known as Acharya [[Vijayanandsuri]], who died on 20 May 1896.<ref>[https://dailytimes.com.pk/402564/the-legend-of-atmaram-jis-samadhi/ The legend of Atmaram Ji’s Samadhi, Tania Qureshi, Daily Times, MAY 28, 2019]</ref> The samadhi, now being restored, was visited by Jain Acharya Dharmadhurandar Suri in on 28 May 2023, along with other Jain munis and lay Jains after a gap to more than 75 years.<ref>[https://palisirohionline.in/2023/05/28/dharm-dhulandhr-jain-santh/ पूजनीय आत्म वल्लभजी के गुरुदेव आत्मारामजी समाधि धाम में जैनाचार्य पूजनीय धर्मधुरंधर जी मा.सा का आगमन, PALI SIROHI ONLINE, Nagendra Agrawal, May 28, 2023]</ref>

Gujranwala grew rapidly following British rule, and connection of the city to the railways of British India. The city grew outside of the city's walls, requiring new bazaars to be laid, which were done in a radial plan centred on the old city.<ref name="Naz" /> Some historic structures like the [[Haveli]] of Sardar Mahan Singh were torn down by the British and replaced with other structures. The city's Brandreth, Lahori, and Khiyali Gates were built atop the city's demolished original gates, while Mahan Singh's haveli was transformed into a public square named Ranjit Ganj.<ref name="Naz" /> The city's boundaries remained mostly west of the railways' line prior to 1947.<ref name="Naz" />

The Civil Lines neighbourhood was built for European residents approximately one mile north of the old city. The area was characterized by bungalows, large and verdant lawns, and shady tree-lined avenues.<ref name="Naz" /> Civil Lines is where the city's Presbyterian Church was built in 1875, while the city's Theological Seminary was established here in 1877. The Christian Technical Training Center followed suit in 1900.<ref name="Naz" /> The city's elite Hindus and Sikhs eventually also settled in small numbers in Civil Lines.<ref name="Naz" /> Several of their mansions still remain in the area including those of Charan Singh, Banarsi Shah, as well as other buildings such as Islamia College and Khurshid Manzil.<ref name="Naz" />

Growth occurred mostly in areas northwest and southeast of the city immediately after independence until 1965 along routes emanating from old Gujranwala. Satellite Town was established on the southwest side in 1950. Areas northeast and southwest of the city were the sites of most growth between 1965 and 1985. The growth grows outwards mostly evenly after 1985 until the present time.<ref name="Naz" /> Much of the growth has been unplanned due to poor enforcement of development guidelines and lax enforcement of property laws.<ref name="Naz" />
