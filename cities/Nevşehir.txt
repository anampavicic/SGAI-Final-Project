'''Nevşehir''' ({{IPA|tr|'nevʃehiɾ}}; from {{lang|tr|nev}} 'new' and {{lang|tr|şehir}} 'city') is a city in the [[Central Anatolia Region]] of [[Turkey]]. It is the seat of [[Nevşehir Province]] and [[Nevşehir District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 22 May 2023.</ref> Its population is 123,882 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=22 May 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref> It is {{convert|290|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from the capital [[Ankara]] and lies within the historical region of [[Cappadocia]].

The town lies at an elevation of {{convert|1224|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and has a continental climate, with heavy snow in winter and great heat in summer. Although Nevşehir is close to the underground cities, [[fairy chimney]]s, [[monasteries]], [[caravanserai]]s and rock-hewn churches of [[Cappadocia]], and has a few hotels, the modern town is not itself a tourist centre. In 2015 a huge underground city was discovered underneath its centre following demolition works intended to clear the central hillside of ramshackle modern housing.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-03-26 |title=Massive Underground City Found in Cappadocia Region of Turkey |url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/150325-underground-city-cappadocia-turkey-archaeology |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210221115607/https://www.nationalgeographic.com/adventure/article/150325-underground-city-cappadocia-turkey-archaeology |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 21, 2021 |access-date=2022-04-11 |website=Adventure |language=en}}</ref>

Two planned high-speed rail services should eventually link Nevşehir to [[Antalya]], [[Konya]], [[Kayseri]] and [[Ankara]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://raillynews.com/2017/12/nevsehirden-1-degil-2-hizli-tren-hatti/|title=Not 1, but 2 high-speed train lines will pass through Nevşehir}}</ref>

==History==

[[File:Cappadocia Aerial View (6998755984).jpg|thumb|left|View of the [[Cappadocia]] landscape in Nevşehir province]]

=== Prehistory and ancient history ===
The [[Hittites]] first founded the settlement of Nissa on the slopes of Mount Kahveci, located in the present-day settlement of Nar, in the valley of [[Kızılırmak (river)|Kızılırmak]] (the ancient [[Halys River|Halys]]). The settlement was later known as Soanda and Seandos. This town, along with the region, came under the rule of the [[Assyria]]n Empire around the 8th century BC, and was subsequently ruled by the [[Medes]] and then by the [[Persians]] during the reign of emperor [[Cyrus the Great]] in 546 BC. In 333 BC, [[Alexander the Great]] defeated the Persians and after his death, the surrounding area came under the rule of the dynasty of [[Ariarathes (disambiguation)|Ariarathes]]<!--intentional link to DAB page--> with [[Caesarea (Mazaca)|Mazaka]] (present-day [[Kayseri]]) as its capital. The Cappadocian kingdom became a  province- of the Roman empire in the reign of Emperor [[Tiberius]]. 

=== Medieval history ===
The so-called underground cities found around Nevşehir  may originally have been built to escape persecution by the pagan [[Roman Empire|Roman]] authorities although others believe they date back to Hittite times.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Derinkuyu: Mysterious underground city in Turkey found in man's basement |url=https://bigthink.com/strange-maps/derinkuyu-underground-city/ |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=Big Think |language=en-US}}</ref> Many of the churches, hewn in the rocks, date from these early years of Christianity. Even when [[Theodosius I]] made Christianity the official religion of the empire, the caves offered protection for the local people during raids by the [[Sassanid]] Persians circa AD 604 and by the [[Islamic Caliphate]] from AD 647 onwards. When [[Iconoclasm]] became state policy in the [[Byzantine]] empire, again the caves around Nevşehir became shelters for those escaping persecution. Nevşehir was known as '''Neapolis''' (meaning ''New City'' in [[Greek language|Greek]]) throughout much of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] periods.

The castle on the hill in the middle of Nevşehir dates from the Byzantine period, when the region was on the frontline in the (holy) wars against the Islamic Caliphate.<ref>{{Cite web |last=fibhaber.com |title=Nevşehir Kalesi tarihe ışık tutuyor |url=https://www.fibhaber.com/yasam/nevsehir-kalesi-tarihe-isik-tutuyor-h106697.html |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=fibhaber.com |language=tr}}</ref>

At the [[Battle of Manzikert]] (present-day [[Malazgirt]]) in AD 1071, the Byzantine emperor [[Romanos IV]] was defeated by the Seljuk Sultan [[Alp Arslan]] which led to the occupation of Anatolia by the Seljuks by 1074. Along with the rest of the region, Nevşehir became part of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]], then fell under the rule of the [[Karamanids|Karamanid]] dynasty in 1328 and finally under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule around 1487 AD when it was renamed Muşkara. It remained relatively insignificant until the early 18th century.

=== Modern history ===
[[File:Kayaşehir (cropped).jpg|thumb|Kayaşehir and the surrounding seen from [[Nevşehir Castle]]]]
The present-day city owes its foundation in the so-called [[Tulip period|Tulip Age]] to the [[grand vizier]] and son-in-law of the Sultan [[Ahmed III]], [[Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Pasha|Nevşehirli Damad İbrahim Pasha]] who was born in Muşkara and later took a great interest in its expansion. The small village with only 18 houses, formerly under the administration of the [[qadaa|kaza]] of [[Ürgüp]], was rapidly transformed with the building of mosques (the [[:c:Category:Kurşunlu Mosque, Nevşehir|Kurṣunlu Mosque]]), fountains, schools, soup kitchens, inns and bath houses, and its name was changed from Muşkara to "Nevşehir" (meaning ''New City'' in [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]). In 1730 the grand vizier was assassinated by rebels in İstanbul but by then Nevşehir was firmly established as a town.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nevşehirli Damat İbrahim Paşa |url=http://www.biyografya.com/biyografi/12724 |access-date=2022-08-09 |website=www.biyografya.com |language=en}}</ref>

According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the [[kaza]] of Nevşehir had a total population of 39,822, consisting of 30,370 Muslims, 8,918 [[Ottoman Greeks|Greeks]], 477 [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenians]], 36 [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] and 21 [[Protestantism|Protestants]].<ref>[[Kemal Karpat]] (1985), [https://kupdf.net/downloadFile/59e4a7b908bbc56144e653d7 Ottoman Population, 1830-1914, Demographic and Social Characteristics], [[The University of Wisconsin Press]], p. 142-143</ref>

Under the terms of the [[Convention Concerning the Exchange of Greek and Turkish Populations]] in 1923, the Turkish speaking [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] community ([[Karamanlides|Karamanlis]]) of Nevşehir was exchanged for Muslims from Osheni, Shak and Revani villages of [[Kesriye]] (today's Οινόη, Κομνηνάδες and Διποταμία villages of Kastoria, Western Macedonia, Greece).
