'''Magnitogorsk''' ({{lang-rus|Магнитого́рск|p=məɡnʲɪtɐˈɡorsk}}, {{literally|[city] of the magnetic mountain}}) is an industrial city in [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]], Russia, on the eastern  side of the extreme southern extent of the [[Ural Mountains]] by the [[Ural River]]. Its population is currently {{Ru-census2021|410594}}.

Magnitogorsk was named after [[Magnetic Mountain|Mount Magnitnaya]], a geological anomaly that once consisted almost completely of [[iron ore]], around 55% to 60% [[iron]].  It is the second-largest city in Russia that is not the [[administrative centre]] of any [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] or [[raion#Administrative districts|district]]. Magnitogorsk contains the largest iron and [[steel]] works in the country: [[Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works]]. The official motto of the city is "the place where Europe and Asia meet", as the city occupies land in both Europe and Asia.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Magnitogorsk is one of only two planned [[Socialist realism|socialist realist]] settlements ever built (the other being [[Nowa Huta]] in Poland).

==History==
[[File:Magnitogorsk steel production facility 1930s.jpg|thumb|right|upright| [[Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works]], 1930s]]

===Foundation===
Magnitogorsk was founded in 1743 as part of the [[Orenburg]] Line of forts built during the reign of the [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]]. By 1747 the settlement had grown large enough to justify the building of a small wooden chapel, later named "the Church of the Holy Trinity".

Russian iron-ore mining in this region dates back to 1752, when two entrepreneurs named Tverdysh and Myasnikov decided to explore the feasibility of mining in the area. They took advantage of the fact that Mount Magnitnaya did not belong to anyone at that time; they secured it for themselves by way of petition to Empress Elizabeth. In 1759 the petition was accepted, and they launched iron-ore production.

===Growth===
The city underwent rapid change in the 1930s when, according to [[Five-year plans for the national economy of the Soviet Union|Stalin's Five-Year-Plans]], Magnitogorsk was to become a one-industry town modeled after two of the most advanced steel-producing cities in the United States at that time: [[Gary, Indiana]], and [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. At this time, hundreds of foreign experts streamed in to implement and direct the work.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://soviethistory.msu.edu/1929-2/magnetic-mountain/|title=Magnetic Mountain|date=June 17, 2015|website=Seventeen Moments in Soviet History|language=en-US|access-date=January 19, 2019}}</ref>

In 1928 a Soviet delegation arrived in [[Cleveland, Ohio]], to discuss with American consulting company Arthur&nbsp;G.&nbsp;McKee a plan to set up in Magnitogorsk a copy of the US Steel steel-mill in Gary. The contract was increased four times, and eventually the new plant had a capacity of over four million tons annually.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=A1SKALUTXnYC|title= Imagining America: Influence and Images in Twentieth-century Russia|first= Alan M.|last= Ball|date= April 2, 2018|publisher= Rowman & Littlefield Publishers|isbn= 9780742527935|access-date= April 2, 2018|via= Google Books}}</ref>

It was a showpiece of Soviet achievement. Huge reserves of [[iron ore]] in the area made it a prime location to build a steel plant capable of challenging its Western rivals. However, a large proportion of the workforce, as ex-[[peasant]]s, typically had few industrial skills and little industrial experience. To solve these issues, several hundred foreign specialists arrived to direct the work, including a team of architects headed by the German [[Ernst May]].

According to the original plans, the city was to have followed the [[Linear settlement|linear city]] design, with rows of similar [[City block#Superblock|superblock]] neighborhoods running parallel to the factory, with a strip of greenery, or greenbelt, separating them. Planners would align living and production spheres so as to minimize necessary travel time: workers would generally live in a sector of the residential band closest to the sector of the industrial band in which they worked.

However, by the time that May completed his plans for Magnitogorsk, construction of both factory and housing had already started. The sprawling factory and enormous cleansing lakes had left little room available for development, and May therefore had to redesign his settlement to fit the modified site.  This modification resulted in a city being more "rope-like" than linear. Although the industrial area is concentrated on the left bank of the river Ural, and most residential complexes are on its right bank, the city inhabitants are still subjected to noxious fumes and factory smoke.{{citation needed|date= December 2013}}

The book ''Behind the Urals'', by [[John Scott (writer)|John Scott]], documents the industrial development of Magnitogorsk during the 1930s. Scott discusses the fast-paced industrial and social developments during Stalin's first five-year plan and the rising paranoia of the Soviet regime preceding the [[Great Purge]] of the late 1930s.

===Closed city===
In 1937 foreigners were told to leave, and Magnitogorsk was declared a [[closed city]]. There is little reliable information about events and development of the city during the closed period.

The city played an important role during [[World War II]] because it supplied much of the steel for the Soviet war effort. Furthermore, its strategic location east of the [[Ural Mountains]] made Magnitogorsk safe from seizure by the [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German Army]].<ref name="PPG2014">

===Re-opening===
During [[perestroika]], the closed-city status was removed, and foreigners were allowed to visit the city again. The years after perestroika brought a significant change in the life of the city; the Iron and Steel Plant was reorganized as a joint-stock company [[Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works]] (MISW or MMK), which helped with the reconstruction of the railway and the building of a new airport.

With the depletion of the substantial local iron-ore reserves, Magnitogorsk has to import raw materials from northern [[Kazakhstan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/16/world/in-stalin-s-city-of-steel-change-confronts-inertia.html|title=In Stalin's City of Steel, Change Confronts Inertia|language=en|date=August 16, 1988|access-date=March 30, 2024|website=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

==== Magnitogorsk building collapse ====
{{main|2018 Magnitogorsk building collapse}}

On December 31, 2018, an [[Khrushchyovka|apartment block]] in the city of Magnitogorsk suffered a [[gas explosion]] and [[Building collapse|collapse]] which killed 39 of its residents, and injured 17 more.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Спасательная операция на месте обрушения подъезда в Магнитогорске завершена.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is incorporated as the [[City of federal subject significance|City]] of Magnitogorsk—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Chelyabinsk Oblast|districts]].<ref name="Ref30">Resolution #161</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], the City of Magnitogorsk is incorporated as Magnitogorsky Urban Okrug.<ref name="Ref30" />

==Transport==
The city is connected by the [[Magnitogorsk International Airport]] and by a railway. Public transport includes trams, buses, and taxis. The city is ranked 8th in the world and 2nd in Russia for automobile congestion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inrix.com/scorecard-city/?city=Magnitogorsk&index=8|title=Magnitogorsk's Scorecard Report|last=INRIX|website=INRIX - INRIX|access-date=April 2, 2018}}</ref>

==Education and culture==
There are two establishments of higher education in Magnitogorsk: [[Magnitogorsk State Technical University]] (MSTU) and [[Magnitogorsk State Conservatory]] (MSC). [[Magnitogorsk State University]] (MaSU), founded in 1932, in 2013 was merged with MSTU and ceased to exist as a separate university.

There are also three theatres: Pushkin Drama Theatre (the oldest in the city), the Opera and Ballet House, and the Puppet Theatre. The Church of the Ascension of the Lord opened in 2004.

Magnitogorsk is home to the [[Rear-front Memorial]].

==Geography==
The city is located on the eastern side of the extreme southern extent of the Ural Mountains by the Ural River.

Magnitogorsk was mentioned in the [[Blacksmith Institute]]'s 2007 survey of the world's worst polluted cities, placed in the report's unranked list of the 25 most-polluted places outside the top ten. Pollutants include [[lead]], [[sulfur dioxide]], heavy metals and other air pollutants. According to the local hospital, only 1% of all children living in the city are in good health. The Blacksmith Institute says that, according to a local newspaper report, "only 28% of infants born in 1992 were healthy, and only 27% had healthy mothers". However, according to Blacksmith Institute, plant managers have upgraded much of their equipment in recent years and emissions have been reduced by about 60%.<ref>''[http://www.worstpolluted.org/reports/file/2007%20Report%20updated%202009.pdf The World's Worst Polluted Places: The Top Ten]'', [[Blacksmith Institute]], September 2007</ref>

===Climate===
Magnitogorsk has a distinct four-season [[humid continental climate]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=83882&cityname=Magnitogorsk%2C+Chelyabinsk%2C+Russia&units=|title=Magnitogorsk, Russia Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|access-date=December 28, 2014}}</ref> ([[Köppen climate classification|Dfb]]) with relatively severe winters for the latitude. This climate type is typical for southerly Russian areas far from large bodies of water. The average July high is around {{convert|25|C|F}} with lows of {{convert|13|C|F}} with January averages ranging from {{convert|-10|C|F}} in daytime high to {{convert|-18|C|F}} in average low.<ref name="Weatherbase">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=83882&cityname=Magnitogorsk-Russia|title=Magnitogorsk, Russia Weather Averages|publisher=Weatherbase|access-date=December 28, 2014}}</ref> Temperatures approaching {{convert|34|C|F}} or above have been measured from May to September with real severe frosts below {{convert|-36|C|F}} have been measured in all other months than that except transitional months April and October.<ref name="Weatherbase"/>
