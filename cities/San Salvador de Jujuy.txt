'''San Salvador de Jujuy''' ({{IPA|es|san salβaˈðoɾ ðe xuˈxuj}}), commonly known as '''Jujuy''' and locally often referred to as '''San Salvador''',<ref>[[South American Handbook]] 2009 {{ISBN|978-1-906098-36-0}} p.173</ref> is the capital and largest city of [[Jujuy Province]] in [[Argentine Northwest|northwest]] [[Argentina]]. Also, it is the seat of the [[Doctor Manuel Belgrano Department]]. It lies near the southern end of the [[Quebrada de Humahuaca|Humahuaca Canyon]] where wooded hills meet the lowlands.

Its population at the {{census-ar|2001}} was 237,751 inhabitants. If its [[suburb]]s are included, this figure rises to around 300,000.<ref>[http://www.indec.mecon.ar/ Indec:Instituto Nacional De Estadistica Y Censos De La Republica Argentina] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160221215704/http://www.indec.mecon.ar/ |date=2016-02-21 }}</ref> The current mayor is Raúl Jorge.

== City information ==
The city lies on [[National Route 9 (Argentina)|National Route 9]] that connects [[La Quiaca]] {{convert|289|km|mi|abbr=on}} with [[Salta]] {{convert|120|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and it is {{convert|1525|km|mi|abbr=on}}  from [[Buenos Aires]]. Tourist destinations not far from the city are [[Tilcara]] {{convert|84|km|mi|abbr=on}}, [[Humahuaca]] {{convert|126|km|mi|abbr=on}}, and the [[Calilegua National Park]] {{convert|111|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Jujuy is located near the [[Andes]], at the junction of the Xibi Xibi River and the Río Grande de Jujuy, 1,238 meters above sea level. The weather is humid during the summer and dry and cold during the winter. Temperatures vary widely between day and night. 
 
The city is the provincial government, financial and cultural centre. Most administrative offices related to economic activities that take place in other parts of the province are located here; these activities include [[petroleum]] extraction and pre-processing, [[sugarcane]] and sugar industry ([[Ledesma Sociedad Anónima Agrícola Industrial|Ledesma]]), [[tobacco]] (El Carmen, {{cvt|10|km}} south), steel (in nearby [[Villa Palpalá]]), [[citrus]], and fruit and vegetable production for local consumption.

The city has a colonial city centre including the Cabildo, the cathedral, and colorful Andean carnivals.

The [[Gobernador Horacio Guzmán International Airport]] {{Airport codes|JUJ|SASJ}} at coordinates {{coord|24|24|00|S|65|05|00|W|}}, is {{convert|33|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of the city (in [[Ciudad Perico]]) and has regular flights to [[Buenos Aires]].

== History ==
{{unreferencedsect|date=June 2022}}
After previous attempts in 1565 and 1592, the current city was founded as ''San Salvador de Velazco en el Valle de Jujuy'' on April 19, 1593, by Francisco de Argañarás y Murguía. The settlement initially developed as a strategic site on the mule trade route between [[San Miguel de Tucumán]] and the silver mines in [[Potosí]], [[Bolivia]].

Reaching its peak importance during the colonial period, San Salvador de Jujuy declined to the status of a remote provincial capital after the [[Argentine Declaration of Independence]] in 1816. The town became the capital of Jujuy Province when the latter separated from [[Salta Province]] in 1834. The [[1863 Jujuy earthquake]] leveled the town, and it recovered slowly in the following decades. Jujuy began to grow following the arrival of the [[Ferrocarril Central Norte|Northern Central Railway]] in 1900. Its first institution of higher learning, the Economic Sciences Institute, was established in 1959, and was incorporated into the new [[National University of Jujuy]] in 1973. The city was the location of a number of [[Argentine cinema|Argentine films]], including ''[[Veronico Cruz (film)|Veronico Cruz]]'' (1988) and ''Una estrella y dos cafés'' (2005). The city's impoverished Lower Azopardo neighborhood would later give rise to [[Milagro Sala]]'s [[Indigenism|Indigenist]] Tupac Amaru Neighborhood Association.

== Climate ==
Jujuy has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), mainly because of the altitude. Summers bring warm days at {{cvt|28|°C}} and nights at {{cvt|16|°C}} with frequent thunderstorms. The rest of the year is sunny, with temperatures at about {{cvt|24|°C}} during the day and {{cvt|11|°C}} at night, crisp, dry winters with warm days of {{cvt|19|°C}} and cold nights at {{cvt|6|°C}}, and sunny springs with warm days at {{cvt|26|°C}} and cool nights at {{cvt|11|°C}}. During heat waves, temperatures can sometimes reach {{cvt|35|°C}} but these are not frequent and nights always bring significant cooling, as opposed to many low-lying areas in Northern Argentina. During the winter, the record low has fallen to {{cvt|-7|°C}}. Precipitation is about {{cvt|800|mm}}, which falls in the form of thunderstorms during the warmest months. The highest temperature recorded was {{cvt|42|°C}} on October 16, 2014 while the lowest temperature recorded was {{cvt|-6.9|°C}} on August 14, 1978.<ref name=SMN2>
