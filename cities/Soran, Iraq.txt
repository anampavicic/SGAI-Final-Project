Cuneiform texts spanning the Early Bronze Age to the early Iron Age suggest the Soran district formed the territorial core of the Hurro-Urartian kingdom of Musasir (Ardini), famed as home to the trans-regional cult center of the Hurrian storm-god Haldi. The [[Assyria]]n king [[Sargon II]] in 714 BC during his renowned Eighth Campaign conquered Soran, which he refers to it as Sarun, and sacked the [[Kurds|Kurdish]] fire temple and its treasury. Archaeological reconnaissance and excavations have revealed evidence for human occupation over the long duration of occupations with clear evidence of the region’s prosperity in the later Bronze and early Iron Age.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Danti|first=Michael|date=|title=The Rowanduz Archaeological Program 2013: First Report to the Kurdistan Regional Government|url=https://www.academia.edu/6884640|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Allison Cuneo|last2=Michael Danti|date=2016|title=The Rowanduz Archaeological Program - Results from the 2015 field season|url=https://core.tdar.org/document/404157/the-rowanduz-archaeological-program-results-from-the-2015-field-season|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=People, gods & places|url=https://www.ucl.ac.uk/sargon/peoplegodsplaces/#uraruplace|access-date=2021-01-23|website=www.ucl.ac.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Saggs|first=H.

In the Medieval era Soran was at the heart of the [[Soran Emirate]] which was established by the Soran Dynasty, it lasted until late 19th century. Its most famous ruler was [[Muhammad Pasha of Rawanduz]].

In the 1920s a settlement in Soran was established by the British to settle [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christian]] refugees as part of the Assyrian settlement scheme in northern Iraq known as the Z plan, and the settlement came to be known as Diana.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Jwaideh|first=Wadie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FCbspX-dGPYC&q=The+inevitable+result+was+the+dispersal+of+the+Assyrian+community+in+the+various+parts+of+northern+Iraqi+Kurdistan+.+Consequently+,+settlements+were+established+in+the+Dohuk+,+'+Amadiya+,+Barwari+Bala+,+Barwari+Zhayr+,+'+Aqra&pg=PA224|title=The Kurdish National Movement: Its Origins and Development|date=2006-06-19|publisher=Syracuse University Press|isbn=978-0-8156-3093-7|location=|pages=224|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Sela|first=Avraham|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YJwsAQAAIAAJ&q=they+settled+in+a+few+areas+in+northern+Iraq+vacated+by+Turks+and+Kurds+,+but+these+were+too+small+to+maintain+all+the+Assyrians|title=Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East: Revised and Updated Edition|date=2002-09-05|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic|isbn=978-0-8264-1413-7|location=|pages=192|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Robson|first=Laura|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F-Q6DgAAQBAJ&q=assyrian+settlement+z+plan&pg=PA55|title=States of Separation: Transfer, Partition, and the Making of the Modern Middle East|date=2017-04-18|publisher=Univ of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-96566-9|location=|pages=54–5|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Hamilton|first=Archibald Milne|title=Road through Kurdistan: travels in Northern Iraq|year=1937|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|isbn=978-1-85043-637-9|page=93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bfNajoa3BtIC&pg=PA214}}</ref>
