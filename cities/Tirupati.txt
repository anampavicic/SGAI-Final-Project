There was no human settlement at lower Tirupati until 1500. With the growing importance of upper Tirupati, a village formed at the present-day Kapilatheertham Road area and was named "kotturu". It was later shifted to the vicinity of [[Govindaraja Temple, Tirupati|Govindarajaswamy Temple]] which was consecrated around the year 1130 CE. Later the village grew into its present-day form around Govindaraja Swamy Temple which is now the heart of the city. It has now gained a lot of popularity as a tourism place.<ref name=TirupatiHistory1>{{cite book|title=Sri Venkateshwara by Shantha Nair|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CY9eAAAAQBAJ&q=Upper+Tirupathi&pg=PT118|access-date=21 June 2015|isbn = 9788184954456|last1 = Nair|first1 = Shantha|date = 7 January 2014| publisher=Jaico Publishing House }}</ref>
