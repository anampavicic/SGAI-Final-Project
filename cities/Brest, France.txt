During the [[Middle Ages]], the history of Brest was the history of its [[Château de Brest|castle]]. Then [[Cardinal Richelieu|Richelieu]] made it a [[Naval base|military harbour]] in 1631.<ref name="Britannica"/> Brest grew around its [[Brest Arsenal|arsenal]] until the second part of the 20th century.

Brest is also an important research centre, mainly focused on the sea, with among others the largest [[Ifremer]] (French Research Institute for Exploitation of the Sea) centre, ''le Cedre'' (Centre of Documentation, Research and Experimentation on Accidental Water Pollution) and the French Polar Institute.

Brest's history has since the 17th century been linked to the sea: the ''[[Académie de Marine]]'' (Naval Academy) was founded in 1752 in this city. The aircraft carrier {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle||2}} was built there. Every four years, Brest hosts the international festival of the sea, boats and sailors: it is a meeting of old [[rigging]]s from around the world (''[[Brest Maritime Festival#2012 edition|Les Tonnerres de Brest]]'').

Nothing definite is known of Brest before about 1240,{{Dubious|date=August 2011}} when [[Harvey V, Lord of Léon]] ceded it to [[John I, Duke of Brittany]]. In 1342 [[John IV, Duke of Brittany]] surrendered Brest to the English, in whose possession it was to remain until 1397.<ref name="Britannica">{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Brest-France |title=Brest, France |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> This was strategically important to the English as it helped protect their communication with [[Gascony]].<ref name="Rodger 2004">{{cite book |last1=Rodger |first1=N.A.M. |title=The Safeguard of the Sea.

With the marriage of [[Francis I of France]] to [[Claude of France|Claude]], the daughter of [[Anne of Brittany]], the definitive overlordship of Brest – together with the rest of the duchy – passed to the [[French crown]] in 1491.<ref name="Britannica"/>

The advantages of Brest's situation as a seaport town were first recognized by [[Cardinal Richelieu]], who in 1631 constructed a harbour with wooden [[wharf|wharves]]. This soon became a base for the [[French Navy]]. [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]], finance minister under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], rebuilt the wharves in masonry and otherwise improved the harbour. Fortifications by [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban|Vauban]] (1633–1707) followed in 1680–1688. These fortifications, and with them the naval importance of the town, were to continue to develop throughout the 18th century.

In 1694, an English squadron under [[John Berkeley, 3rd Baron Berkeley of Stratton|Lord Berkeley]] was soundly defeated in its [[attack on Brest]].

In 1917, during the [[First World War]], Brest was used as the disembarking port for many of the troops coming from the United States. Thousands of such men came through the port on their way to the front lines. The [[United States Navy]] established a [[naval air station]] on 13 February 1918 to operate [[seaplane]]s. The base closed shortly after the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]].<ref name=nan>{{cite book |last=Van Wyen |first=Adrian O. |title =Naval Aviation in World War I |url=https://archive.org/details/navalaviationinw00wash |publisher =Chief of Naval Operations |date =1969 |location =Washington, D.C. |page =[https://archive.org/details/navalaviationinw00wash/page/65 65]}}</ref>

In the [[Second World War]], the [[Nazi Germany|Germans]] maintained a large [[U-boat]] [[submarine]] base at Brest. Despite being within range of RAF bombers, it was also a base for some of the German surface fleet, giving repair facilities and direct access to the Atlantic Ocean. For much of 1941, {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}}, {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} were under repair in the dockyards. The repair yard facilities for both submarines and surface vessels were staffed by both German and French workers, with the latter forming the major part of the workforce; huge reliance was made on this French component.{{efn|For example, by February 1941 only 470 German shipyard workers had arrived at Brest, whilst the Naval Arsenal had 6,349 French workers. Though work on capital ships was generally done by Germans, French employees worked extensively on submarines and the smaller military vessels in the surface fleet. German Navy reports indicate that this was a willing workforce and that there were no incidences of sabotage. As well as working on ship repairs, the French provided a significant fire-fighting force to help negate the effect of Allied air raids. This story is balanced by Resistance activity, such as that of Jean Philippon, a French Naval Lieutenant Commander who provided important ship movement intelligence to the Allies for more than a year. This espionage was a key component in the effectiveness of Allied air raids which ultimately led to the [[Channel Dash|removal of German capital ships to safer bases]].}}<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hellwinkel|first1=Lars|title=Hitler's Gateway to the Atlantic: German Naval Bases in France 1940–1945|date=2014|publisher=Seaforth Publishing|pages=Kindle location 1151–1369|edition=Kindle}}</ref>

In 1944, after the Allied [[invasion of Normandy]], the city was almost totally destroyed during the [[Battle for Brest]], with only a tiny number of buildings left standing. After the war, the [[West Germany|West German]] government paid several billion [[Deutschmark]]s in [[war reparations|reparations]] to the homeless and destitute civilians of Brest in compensation for the destruction of their city. Large parts of today's rebuilt city consist of utilitarian [[granite]] and concrete buildings. The French naval base now houses the [[Brest Naval Training Centre]].

During the postwar [[Nuremberg Trials]], a memorandum of German admiral and {{lang|de|[[Seekriegsleitung]]}} chief of staff [[Kurt Fricke]] from 1940 was given in evidence which suggested that the town should perhaps serve as a German enclave after the war.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-02/tgmwc-02-15-03.shtml |title=The Nizkor Project – Nuremberg Trials transcript |access-date=20 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130126103200/http://nizkor.org/hweb/imt/tgmwc/tgmwc-02/tgmwc-02-15-03.shtml |archive-date=26 January 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1972, the French Navy opened its [[nuclear weapon]]-submarine (deterrence) base at [[Île Longue]] in the ''Rade de Brest'' (Brest [[roadstead]]). This continues to be an important base for the French nuclear-armed [[ballistic missile]] submarines.

===Coat of arms===
The [[coat of arms]] of Brest is divided in two: to the left, there's the [[Coat of arms of France|three fleurs-de-lis of the former kingdom of France]], and to the right it has the [[Ermine (heraldry)|ermines]] of the [[Duchy of Brittany]]. These arms were used for the first time in a register of deliberations of the city council dated the 15 July 1683{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}. Additionally, it looks visually identical to the coat of arms of [[Bourg-la-Reine]].

[[File:Rue de Siam.jpg|thumb|''[[Rue de Siam]]'' (Siam Street) in 2006]]

''[[Pont de Recouvrance]]'' (Recouvrance Bridge, is a massive drawbridge 64 m/210&nbsp;ft high), the [[arsenal de Brest|military arsenal]] and the [[Rue de Siam|''rue de Siam'' (Siam Street)]] are other sights. The [[Brest Castle|castle]] and the [[Tour Tanguy|Tanguy tower]] are the oldest monuments of Brest.

The ''Musée de la Tour Tanguy'', in the Tanguy tower, houses a collection of [[diorama]]s that depict the city of Brest on the eve of World War II. The ''[[Musée national de la Marine]] de Brest'', housed in the ancient castle, contains exhibits which outline Brest's maritime tradition, as well as an aquarium, the Océanopolis marine centre. The city also has a notable [[botanical garden]] specializing in [[endangered species]], the ''[[Conservatoire botanique national de Brest]]'', as well as the ''[[Jardin botanique de l'Hôpital d'Instruction des Armées Clermont-Tonnerre]]''.

The city of Brest does not have much remaining historical architecture, apart from a few select monuments such as the castle and the Tanguy tower. This is due to heavy bombing by the Allies during World War II, in an attempt to destroy the [[submarine base]] the Germans had built in the harbour. In the 1950s, the town was hastily rebuilt using a large amount of concrete. In [[Recouvrance, Brest|Recouvrance]], the west bank of the town, there remains an authentic street of the 17th century, Saint-Malo Street.

A few kilometres out of town, there are landscapes, from sandy beaches to [[grotto]]s to tall [[granite]] cliffs. [[Sunbathing]], [[windsurfing]], [[yachting]] and fishing are enjoyed in the area. Brest was an important warship-producing port during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. The naval port, which is in great part excavated in the rock, extends along both banks of the [[Penfeld]] river.

==Geography==
[[File:Topographie de brest.jpg|200px|thumb|Topography of Brest]]
[[File:Brest.png|thumb|left|Brest and the surrounding area]]
Brest is located amidst a dramatic landscape near the entrance of the natural ''[[rade de Brest]]'' (Brest roadstead), at the west end of Brittany.

It is situated to the north of a magnificent landlocked bay, and occupies the slopes of two hills divided by the river Penfeld. The part of the town on the left bank is regarded as Brest proper, while the part on the right is known as [[Recouvrance, Brest|Recouvrance]]. There are also extensive suburbs to the east of the town. The hillsides are in some places so steep that the ascent from the lower to the upper town has to be effected by flights of steps and the second or third storey of one house is often on a level with the ground storey of the next.

===Climate===
Brest experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''). As a result of maritime moderation, Brest has cool summers by French standards, July afternoons are cooler than the norm in Western Europe. Rainfall is common year-round, but snowfall is a rarer occurrence since temperatures usually remain several degrees above freezing during winter nights.

An extreme temperature of {{convert|39.3|C|F}} was recorded on [[2022 European heat waves|18 July 2022]].

==Transport==
[[File:Aerogare Brest.jpg|thumb|left|[[Brest Bretagne Airport]], main airport of the [[Brittany (administrative region)|region of Brittany]]]]
[[File:Brest Harbour.jpg|thumb|The harbour of Brest]]

The railway station of Brest, [[Gare de Brest]], is linked to [[Gare de Rennes|Rennes]] and [[Gare Montparnasse|Paris]] and provides services to other stations in Brittany as well. [[TGV]] trains to Paris take approximately three hours and forty minutes to reach the capital.

A new 28-stop, {{convert|14.3|km|0|abbr=on}} [[Brest Tramway|tram line]] connecting Porte de Plouzané in the west with Porte de Gouesnou and Porte de Guipavas northeast of the city centre opened in June 2012.<ref>{{cite magazine|title=Brest tramway opens|url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/brest-tramway-opens.html|date=26 June 2012|access-date=29 June 2012|magazine=[[Railway Gazette International]]|archive-date=29 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629033829/http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/brest-tramway-opens.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Brest international airport, [[Brest airport|Brest Bretagne Airport]], is mainly linked to Paris, London, [[Nice]], [[Lyon]], Dublin. The primary operator is [[Air France]] (via its subsidiary [[HOP!]]). Brest international airport is the main airport of the [[Brittany (administrative region)|region of Brittany]] in terms passager traffic with 45% of this traffic of the region, representing 919,404 passengers in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://brest.letelegramme.com/local/finistere-nord/brest/ville/port-et-aeroport-progressions-en-2010-08-01-2011-1168234.php |title=Le Télégramme – Brest ville – Port et aéroport de Brest.

The harbour of Brest is mainly dedicated to [[Bulk cargo|bulk]], hydrocarbon and [[freight container]]s. The harbour's facilities can accommodate the largest modern ships. A cruise ship port is also located in Brest, near the city centre.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.avidcruiser.com/port-profiles/europe/mediterranean/france/brest/ |title=Port of Call: Brittany's Brest |work=The Avid Cruiser |access-date=9 July 2021 |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101007195436/http://www.avidcruiser.com:80/port-profiles/europe/mediterranean/france/brest/ |archive-date=7 October 2010}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Jeanne D Arc 4.jpg|thumb|The [[Penfeld]] river, historic centre of the arsenal of Brest]]

Due to its location, Brest is regarded as the first French port that can be accessed from the Americas. Shipping is big business, although [[Nantes]] and [[Saint-Nazaire]] offer much larger docks and attract more of the larger vessels. Brest has the ninth French commercial harbour including ship repairs and maintenance. The protected location of Brest means that its harbour is ideal to receive any type of ship, from the smallest [[dinghy]] to the biggest [[aircraft carrier]] ({{USS|Nimitz}} has visited a few times). Naval construction is also an important activity: for example, the {{ship|French aircraft carrier|Charles de Gaulle}} was built by [[Direction des Constructions Navales]] (DCN) in Brest.

Despite its image of an industrialised city whose activity depends mainly on military order, the [[tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]] represents 75% of the economic activity. The importance of the service sector is still increasing while industrialised activity is decaying, explaining the unchanged rate of working-class in Brest. Brest also hosts headquarters for many subsidiaries like the banking group Arkéa. Research and conception is taking an increasing importance. Brest claims to be the largest European centre for sciences and techniques linked to the sea: 60% of the French research in the maritime field is based in Brest.<ref>[http://www.cub-brest.fr/fr-investinbrest/documents/recherche.pdf Source: Invest in Brest, BMO] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122031447/http://www.cub-brest.fr/fr-investinbrest/documents/recherche.pdf |date=22 November 2008}}</ref>

==Breton language==
[[Breton language|Breton]] is not commonly spoken in the city of Brest, which was the only French-speaking city in western Brittany before the 1789 [[French Revolution]], despite the surrounding countryside being fully Breton-speaking at that time. Like other [[Languages of France|French minority languages]], Breton does not have any official language status in France.

The municipality launched a linguistic plan to revive Breton as a language through ''[[Ya d'ar brezhoneg]]'' on 16 June 2006. In 2008, 1.94% of primary-school children attended French-Breton bilingual [[Diwan (school)|Diwan]] schools.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} ''Ofis ar Brezhoneg'': [http://www.ofis-bzh.org/fr/services/observatoire/travaux.php?travail_id=83''Enseignement bilingue'']</ref> Besides bilingual schools, the Breton language is also taught in some schools and universities.

The association ''Sked'' federates all Breton cultural activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sked.bzh/ |title=[SKED&#93; Les nouveautés |publisher=Sked.infini.fr |access-date=26 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128075656/http://sked.infini.fr/ |archive-date=28 January 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Culture==
[[File:Bateaux-Brest2004.jpg|thumb|Sailboats during "Brest 2004"]]

The city is host to several events to celebrate its long maritime history. The largest of these is held every four years, when the town organises a [[tall ship]] meeting. The last such tall ship event was "Les Tonnerres de Brest 2016". Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] the next event is planned for 2022.

[[File:Vue_de_la_Rade_de_Brest_depuis_la_place_des_Machines%2C_au_sein_des_ateliers_des_Capucins.jpg|thumb|View of the [[Rade de Brest]] from the Place des Machines in the Capucins workshops]]
Brest also hosts an annual short film festival called "[[Brest European Short Film Festival]]". The city was the setting for the 1982 art film ''[[Querelle]]'', directed by [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], itself based on the 1947 novel ''[[Querelle of Brest|Querelle de Brest]]'' by [[Jean Genet]].

==Cuisine==
Brittany's most famous local delicacy, the [[Crêpe bretonne|Breton crêpe]], is the main culinary feature apart from seafood. There are many crêpe restaurants (called ''crêperies''). Breton apple [[cider]] is often featured.

Traditional biscuits include ''[[Traou Mad]]'', which is a full-fat butter biscuit similar to Scottish [[shortbread]].

==Sport==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}
Brest has held the [[List of Tour de France Grands Départs|Grands Départs]] of the [[Tour de France]] on three occasions, in [[1952 Tour de France|1952]], [[1974 Tour de France|1974]] and [[2008 Tour de France|2008]]. The [[2021 Tour de France]] started from Brest on 26 June 2021. Stage 6 of the [[2018 Tour de France]] departed from Brest. Since 1901 Brest has served as the midpoint for the {{convert|1200|km|mi|abbr=on}} bicycle endurance event, [[Paris–Brest–Paris]].

Brest is home to [[Stade Brestois 29]], a [[Association football|football]] team in [[Ligue 1]]. the top tier of the [[French football league system]].

Brest is also home to [[Brest Albatros Hockey]], an ice hockey team in [[Ligue Magnus]], and won the league title in the [[1995–96 Élite Ligue season|1996]] and [[1996–97 Nationale 1A season|1997]].

In 2002 the Brest [[Throwball|throwball team]] Brest LC reached the 1st division of French throwball but were subsequently relegated due to financial difficulty. The club has recently adopted an Irish influenced infrastructure.{{ Clarify|reason=What does that mean?|date=December 2020}}
