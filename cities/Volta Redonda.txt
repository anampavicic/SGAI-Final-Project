'''Volta Redonda''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈvɔwtɐ ʁeˈdõdɐ}}) is the name of a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] state of [[Brazil]] with an area of 182.81&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, located from 350m to 707m above the [[sea level]] (22°31'23" S, 44°06'15" W) and with a population of 273,988 inhabitants (estimated in 2020). The area around the city has nearly 700,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Its name (which is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''Round Turn'') is due to the round shape of a curve in the [[Paraíba do Sul]] river around which the city was built.

Situated in Volta Redonda is [[Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional]] (CSN), [[Brazil]]'s second largest steel producer. Today its economy, despite still being based on [[Industrial sector|industry]], is quite diverse, and largely focused on the areas of services and trade. Due to this, Volta Redonda is worldly known as ''Cidade do Aço'' (which is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''Steel City'').

The city borders with the municipalities of [[Barra Mansa]] (north, northwest, west and southwest), [[Barra do Piraí]] (northeast), [[Pinheiral]], [[Piraí]] (south and east), and [[Rio Claro, Rio de Janeiro|Rio Claro]] (south) and is 130&nbsp;km from the city of [[Rio de Janeiro]].

Along with the municipalities of Barra Mansa and Pinheiral, it is a conurbation of over 500,000 inhabitants, according to the IBGE estimates for 2008, and the state's largest urban spot outside the metropolitan region of Rio de Janeiro.

Economical center of the South Fluminense region, Volta Redonda is a strategic area, close to major hub cities in other regional states, such as [[Juiz de Fora]] (190 kilometers) and [[Sao Jose dos Campos]] (220 kilometers).

In addition, Volta Redonda has the highest rate of offending drivers in the world, a record certified by Guinness World Records.

==History==
In 1744, the first explorers named the curious curve of the [[Paraíba do Sul]] river "Volta Redonda". Big farms were installed in the region and nowadays some farm names are the names of some districts.

Between the years of 1860 and 1870, the navigation through the Paraíba do Sul river had its golden period between the cities of [[Resende, Rio de Janeiro|Resende]] and Barra do Piraí and at the same time the railroad [[Peter II of Brazil|D. Pedro II]] was built in Barra do Piraí and Barra Mansa.

With this, in 1875, the village of Santo Antonio de Volta Redonda started to have great impulse, but with the freedom of slaves in 1888, the decay of the [[Vale do Paraíba]] became visible, destroying the agriculture, which would never recover in a very satisfactory way.

This situation would be reversed in 1941, when the cycle of industrialization of Volta Redonda began. Chosen as site for installing the [[Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional]] (CSN) [[steel mill]] in the middle of [[World War II]], it marked the base of [[Brazil]]ian industrialization. Laborers from diverse regions of the country came to Volta Redonda to work in the mill. When it opened in 1946, it was the first steel mill in [[South America]].

A heavily subsidized symbol of national pride, the Volta Redonda mill embodied the [[import substitution]] industrial policies that prevailed in Latin American economies from [[World War II]] until the [[Latin American debt crisis]] in the 1980s. Since its 1993 privatization, however, the mill — now known as the Presidente Vargas Steelworks — has transcended its ''[[dirigisme|dirigiste]]'' origins to become one of the world's most efficient steel production facilities - due to this large production of [[steel]] and minerals, the city is globally nicknamed "Cidade do Aço" (literal Portuguese for "City of Steel").

== Politics and government ==
Volta Redonda's [[Mayors in Brazil|mayor]] ({{Langx|pt|prefeito}}) is currently Antônio Francisco Neto of the [[Progressistas]] party, elected in [[2020 Brazilian municipal elections|2020]] to serve a four-year term.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Prefeito e vereadores de Volta Redonda tomam posse; veja lista de eleitos|url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/sul-do-rio-costa-verde/noticia/2021/01/01/prefeito-e-vereadores-de-volta-redonda-tomam-posse-veja-lista-de-eleitos.ghtml|access-date=2021-08-28|website=G1|language=pt-br}}</ref> The 21-member council ({{Langx|pt|Câmara Municipal}}) was elected at the same time.<ref name=":0" />

==Education==
In the second half of the 20th century, the city received the boost of technological and higher educational development when in 1961 the Industrial Engineering and Metallurgical Volta Redonda of [[Fluminense Federal University]] who later brought more courses the city with the Institute of Exact Sciences and Institute Humanities and Social Sciences, or also higher education institutions University Center or Geraldo Di Biase - UGB, University Centre of Barra Mansa - UBM and University Center of Volta Redonda - UniFOA was created. In the 2000s, the [[Federal Institute of Rio de Janeiro]] was launched with technological and industrial emphasis.

==Sports==
[[Volta Redonda Futebol Clube]] is the most important [[football (soccer)|football]] club of the city, playing its home matches at [[Estádio Raulino de Oliveira]], which is also located in the city downtown.
