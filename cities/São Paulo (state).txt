'''São Paulo''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|au|_|ˈ|p|aʊ|l|oʊ}}, {{IPA|pt|sɐ̃w ˈpawlu|lang|Br-SaoPaulo.ogg}}) is one of the [[Federative units of Brazil|26 states]] of the [[Brazil|Federative Republic of Brazil]] and is named after [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul of Tarsus]]. It is located in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Region]] and is bordered by the states of [[Minas Gerais]] to the north and northeast, [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] to the south, [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] to the east and [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] to the west, in addition to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the southeast. It is divided into [[List of municipalities in São Paulo|645 municipalities]]. The total area is {{convert|248,219.481|km²|sqmi|abbr=off}} km<sup>2</sup>, which is equivalent to 2.9% of Brazil's surface, being slightly larger than the [[United Kingdom]].

Today's area corresponds to the state territory inhabited by Indigenous peoples from approximately 12,000 BC. In the early 16th century, the coast of the region was visited by [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] explorers and navigators. In 1532 [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]] would establish the first Portuguese permanent settlement in the Americas<ref name="Lawrence183">[[#Lawrence69|Rachel Lawrence]]: 2010, p. 183</ref>—the village of [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]], in the [[Baixada Santista]]. In the 17th century, the paulistas ''[[bandeirantes]]'' intensified the exploration of the colony's interior, which eventually expanded the territorial domain of [[Portugal]] and the Portuguese Empire in South America. In the 18th century, after the establishment of the province of São Paulo, the region began to gain political weight. After [[independence of Brazil|independence]] in 1822, São Paulo began to become a major agricultural producer (mainly [[coffee]]) in the newly constituted [[Empire of Brazil]], which ultimately created a rich regional rural [[oligarchy]], which would switch on the command of the Brazilian government with Minas Gerais's elites during the [[First Brazilian Republic|early republican period]] in the 1890s. Under the [[Vargas Era]], the state was one of the first to initiate a process of [[industrialization]] and its population became one of the most [[Urbanization|urban]] of the federation.

São Paulo's [[economy of the state of São Paulo|economy]] is very strong and diversified, having the [[Industry in Brazil|largest industrial]], [[science|scientific]] and [[technology|technological]] production in the country — being the largest national research and development hub and home to the best universities and institutes —, the world's largest production of [[orange juice]], [[sugar]] and [[Ethanol fuel|ethanol]], and the [[List of Brazilian federative units by gross regional product|highest GDP]] among all Brazilian states, being the only one to exceed the 1 trillion [[Brazilian real|reais]] range. In 2020, São Paulo's economy accounted for around 31.2% of the total wealth produced in the country — which made the state known as the "locomotive of Brazil" — and this is reflected in its cities, many of which are among the richest and most [[Human Development Index|developed]] in the country. São Paulo alone is wealthier than [[Economy of Argentina|Argentina]], [[Economy of Uruguay|Uruguay]], [[Economy of Paraguay|Paraguay]] and [[Economy of Bolivia|Bolivia]] combined, with a GDP of 2.7 trillion reais (603.4 billion [[United States dollar|dollars]]);<ref>{{cite web |date=4 October 2016 |title=Forget the nation-state: cities will transform the way we conduct foreign affairs |url=https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/forget-the-nation-state-cities-will-transform-the-way-we-conduct-foreign-affairs/ |access-date=4 October 2016 |publisher=[[World Economic Forum]] |archive-date=22 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190122173053/https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/10/forget-the-nation-state-cities-will-transform-the-way-we-conduct-foreign-affairs |url-status=live }}</ref> therefore, if it were a sovereign country, its nominal GDP would be the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|21st largest in the world]] (2020 estimate). In addition to the economy, São Paulo is acknowledged as a major [[Tourism in Brazil|Brazilian tourist]] destination by national and international tourists due to its natural beauty, historical and [[cultural heritage]] —it has multiple sites inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]]—, inland resorts, climate and great vocation for the service, [[business]], [[entertainment]], [[fashion]] sectors, culture, leisure, health, education, and many others. It has high social indices compared to those recorded in the rest of the country, such as the [[list of Brazilian federative units by Human Development Index|second-highest]] Human Development Index (HDI), the fourth [[gross regional domestic product|GRDP]] [[per capita]], the [[list of Brazilian states by infant mortality|second-lowest infant mortality rate]], the [[list of Brazilian states by life expectancy|third-highest life expectancy]], the lowest homicide rate, and the [[list of Brazilian states by literacy rate|third-lowest rate of illiteracy]] among the federative units of Brazil.

==History==
{{Main|History of the state of São Paulo}}

===Early period===
The region of the current state of São Paulo was already inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|Amerindian]] peoples since at least approximately 10,000 [[Common Era|BCE]],<ref name="q457">{{cite book | last1=Knox | first1=P. | last2=Florida | first2=R. | title=Atlas of Cities | publisher=Princeton University Press | year=2022 | isbn=978-1-4008-5194-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VtlJEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA11 | access-date=2024-08-11 | page=11}}</ref> as evidenced by studies carried out in ancient archaeological sites (such as the sites Caetetuba, Bastos, Boa Esperança II and Lagoa do Camargo) in different parts of the current territory of São Paulo. There are even records (e.g. - studies at the Rincão I archaeological site) that suggest that ancient human occupation was already present in São Paulo 17 thousand years ago, during the last [[Ice age|glacial maximum]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Cheliz |first1=Pedro Michelutti |last2=Giannini |first2=Paulo Cesar Fonseca |last3=Moreno de Sousa |first3=João Carlos |last4=Ladeira |first4=Francisco Sergio Bernardes |last5=Rodrigues |first5=Juliana Alves |last6=Mingatos |first6=Gabriela Sartori |last7=Pupim |first7=Fabiano Nascimento |last8=Mineli |first8=Thays Desiree |last9=Galhardo |first9=Danilo |last10=Rodrigues |first10=Robson Antonio |date=July 2023 |title=Early anthropic occupation and geomorphological changes in South America: human–environment interactions and OSL data from the Rincão I site, southeastern Brazil |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3505 |journal=Journal of Quaternary Science |language=en |volume=38 |issue=5 |pages=685–701 |doi=10.1002/jqs.3505 |issn=0267-8179 |access-date=14 February 2024 |archive-date=21 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230921142501/https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.3505 |url-status=live }}</ref> There are also several archaeological sites (such as Caetetuba, Alice Boer and Rincão I) in the central portion of the state that share similar patterns of working rocks into stone points and plano-convex artifacts similar to each other, so that they are seen as members of the same ancient ancestral culture, linked to the Rioclarense [[Industry (archaeology)|lithic industry]]. These ancient human groups were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, living as [[nomad]]s and semi-nomads in the current territory of São Paulo, living directly from what they could obtain from the local land.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Moreno |first=João Carlos |date=23 July 2023 |title=Rioclarense Culture Definition, Lithic Technology, and the Case of the Alice Boer and Caetetuba Sites (São Paulo State, Brazil) |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20555563.2023.2236418?src= |access-date=14 February 2024 |journal=PaleoAmerica |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=115–134 |doi=10.1080/20555563.2023.2236418 |archive-date=21 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230821223126/https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/20555563.2023.2236418?src= |url-status=live }}</ref>

In pre-European times, the area that is now São Paulo state was occupied by the [[Tupi people]]'s nation, who subsisted through hunting and cultivation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Os Povos Guarani Na Região de Indaiatuba {{!}} PDF {{!}} Sociedade |url=https://pt.scribd.com/document/35430825/Os-povos-Guarani-na-regiao-de-Indaiatuba |access-date=14 February 2024 |website=Scribd |language=en |archive-date=5 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230505164652/https://pt.scribd.com/document/35430825/Os-povos-Guarani-na-regiao-de-Indaiatuba |url-status=live }}</ref> The first European to settle in the area was [[João Ramalho]], a [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portuguese]] sailor who may have been shipwrecked around 1510, ten years after the first Portuguese landfall in Brazil. He married the daughter of a local chieftain and became a settler. In 1532, the first colonial expedition, led by [[Martim Afonso de Sousa]] of Portugal, landed at [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]] (near the present-day port at [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]]). De Sousa added Ramalho's settlement to his colony.
[[File:Benedito Calixto de Jesus - Fundação de São Vicente, Acervo do Museu Paulista da USP.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|"Founding of [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]]", by [[Benedito Calixto]]]]

Early European colonization of Brazil was very limited. Portugal was more interested in Africa and Asia. But with [[Kingdom of England|English]] and [[Kingdom of France|French]] raiding [[privateer]] ships just off the coast, the territory had to be protected. Unwilling to shoulder the naval defense burden himself, the Portuguese ruler, King [[João III of Portugal|Joao III]], divided the coast into "captaincies", or swathes of land, 50 leagues apart. He distributed them among well-connected Portuguese, hoping that each would be self-reliant. The early port and sugar-cultivating settlement of São Vicente was one rare success connected to this policy. In 1548, João III brought Brazil under direct royal control.

Fearing [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Indian]] attack, he discouraged development of the territory's vast interior. Some whites headed nonetheless for Piratininga, a plateau near São Vicente, drawn by its navigable rivers and agricultural potential. Borda do Campo, the plateau settlement, became an official town (Santo André da Borda do Campo) in 1553. The history of São Paulo city proper begins with the founding of a [[Jesuit]] mission of the [[Roman Catholic]] order of clergy on 25 January 1554—the anniversary of [[Paul the Apostle|Saint Paul]]'s conversion. The station, which is at the heart of the current city, was named [[São Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga]] (or just Pateo do Colégio). In 1560, the threat of Indian attack led many to flee from the exposed [[Santo André da Borda do Campo]] to the walled fortified Colegio. Two years later, the Colégio was besieged. Though the town survived, fighting took place sporadically for another three decades.

By 1600, the town had about 1,500 citizens and 150 households. Little was produced for export, save a number of agricultural goods. The isolation was to continue for many years, as the development of Brazil centered on the sugar plantations in the north-east.<ref name="k878">{{cite book | last=Morse | first=R.M.G. | title=From Community to Metropolis: A Biography of São Paulo, Brazil | publisher=Octagon Books | year=1974 | isbn=978-0-374-95914-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oi8sAAAAYAAJ | access-date=2024-08-11 | page=}}</ref>

The city's location, at the mouth of the [[Paranapanema River|Tietê-Paranapanema]] river system (which winds into the interior), made it an ideal base for another activity—[[slavery|enslaving]] expeditions. The economics were simple. Enslaved manpower for Brazil's northern sugar plantations were in short supply. Enslaved Africans were expensive, so demand for indigenous captives soared. The task was, nonetheless, hard, if not impossible, to achieve.

===Expansion===
[[File:Raposo Tavares (Luigi Brizzolara).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[António Raposo Tavares]], a colonial ''[[bandeirante]]'']]
Among those who attempted to enslave the native were explorers of the hinterland called "''[[bandeirantes]]''". From their base in São Paulo, they also combed the interior in search of natural riches. [[Silver]], [[gold]] and [[diamonds]] were companion pursuits, as well as the exploration of unknown territories. Roman Catholic missionaries sometimes tagged along, as efforts at converting the natives aborigines (Indians) worked hand in hand with Portuguese colonialism.

Despite their atrocities, the wild and hardy bandeirantes are now equally remembered for penetrating Brazil's vast interior. Trading posts established by them became permanent settlements. Interior routes opened up. Though the ''bandeirantes'' had no loyalty to the [[Portuguese crown]], they did claim land for the king. Thus, the borders of Brazil were pushed forward to the northwest and the [[Amazon Basin|Amazon]] region and west to the [[Andes Mountains]].

French Emperor [[Napoleon's invasion of Portugal]] in 1807 prompted the [[United Kingdom|British]] with their vast powerful [[Royal Navy]] to evacuate King [[João VI of Portugal]], Portugal's prince regent, from the capital [[Lisbon, Portugal|Lisbon]], across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]] and Brazil then became the first overseas colony to become the temporary headquarters of the [[Portuguese Empire]]. João VI rewarded his hosts with economic reforms that would prove crucial to São Paulo's rise. Brazil's ports—long closed to non-Portuguese ships—were opened up to international trade. Restrictions on domestic manufacturing were waived.

When Napoleon was defeated in 1815, with the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], João gave political shape to his territory, which soon became the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]]. Portugal and Brazil, in other words, were ostensibly co-equals. Returning to Portugal six years later, João left his son, [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]], to rule as regent and governor.

===Empire of Brazil period===
[[File:Marc Ferrez - IMS 002001MF005003.jpg|thumb|[[São Paulo]] in 1880 during the reign of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]].]]
[[File:Mapa_da_Província_de_São_Paulo_-_1886.jpg|thumb|An 1886 map of the São Paulo State]]
Pedro I of Brazil inherited his father's love of Brazil, resisting demands from [[Lisbon]] that Brazil should be ruled from Europe once again. Legend has it that in 1822 the regent was riding outside São Paulo when a messenger delivered a missive demanding his return to Europe, and Dom Pedro waved his sword and shouted "Independência ou morte!" (Independence or death).

[[John VI of Portugal|João]] had whetted the appetite of [[Brazilians]], who now sought a full break from the monarchy. The ever-restless [[Paulistas]] were at the vanguard of the independence movement. The small mother country of Portugal was in no position to resist—on 7 September 1822, Dom Pedro rubber-stamped Brazil's independence. He was crowned emperor shortly afterwards. The emperors ruled an independent Brazil until 1889. Over this time, the growth of liberalism in Europe had a parallel in Brazil. As the [[Brazilian provinces]] became more assertive, São Paulo was the scene of a minor (and unsuccessful) liberal revolution in 1842. When independence was declared, the city of São Paulo had just 25,000 people and 4,000 houses, but the next 60 years would see gradual growth. In 1828, the [[Faculdade de Direito da Universidade de São Paulo|Law School]], the pioneer of the city's intellectual tradition, opened. The first newspaper, ''O Farol Paulistano'', appeared in 1827. Municipal developments such as [[botanical garden]]s, an [[opera house]] and a [[library]], gave the city a cultural boost.

Regardless, São Paulo still faced many hurdles, especially [[transport]]. Mule-trains were the main method of transportation, and the road from the plateau down to the port of Santos was famously arduous. In the late 1860s São Paulo got its first [[railway]] line, developed by British engineers, to the [[Port of Santos]]. Other lines, such as a railway to Campinas, were soon built. This was good timing, because in the 1880s the coffee craze hit in earnest. Brazil, which had been growing it since the mid-18th century, could grow more. The [[Paraíba valley]], which spans the states of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo, had suitable [[soil]] and [[climate]]. São Paulo city, at the western end of the Paraíba valley, was well positioned to channel the coffee to the port of Santos.

===Republican era===
[[File:Bolsa_Oficial_do_Café,_Santos_2018_048.jpg|thumb|left|Coffee Stock Exchange, in [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]]]]
Meanwhile, the Brazilian monarchy had fallen in 1889. A feudalistic regime, the new republic had friends only among the sugar planters of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], whose dominance Paulistanos, among others, despised. In 1891, a new federal constitution, which delegated power to the states, was approved. The new coffee elite saw its chance. São Paulo ironed out a power-sharing understanding—known as the "[[Milk coffee politics|café com leite]]" (coffee-and-milk) deal—with dairy-rich [[Minas Gerais]], Brazil's other dominant state. Together, they held a virtual lock on federal power. Brazilian politics now became a favourite pastime of the once-rebellious Paulistanos, who sent several presidents to Rio de Janeiro—including [[Prudente de Morais]], Brazil's first civilian president, who took office in 1894.

Plantation labor was needed—this time for coffee, not sugar. [[Slavery in Brazil|Slavery]] had been fading since the import of enslaved Africans was outlawed in 1850. São Paulo, thanks to such figures as [[Luiz Gama]] (a former slave), was a center of abolitionism. In 1888, [[Lei Áurea|Brazil abolished slavery]] (it was the last country in the [[Americas]] to do so) and the freed [[African-Brazilian]]s who had been helping build the nation were then forced to beg for their jobs back, working for food and shelter only because of the failure of the system to integrate them as equal citizens with [[Euro-Brazilians]]. In an effort to "bleach the race", as the nation's leaders feared Brazil was becoming a "black country", [[Spanish immigration to Brazil|Spanish]], [[Portuguese Brazilian|Portuguese]] and [[Italian Brazilian|Italian]] nationals were given incentives to become farm workers in São Paulo. The state government was so eager to bring in European immigrants that it paid for their trips and provided varying levels of subsidy.

By 1893, foreigners made up over 55 percent of São Paulo's population. Fearing oversupply, the government applied the brakes briefly in 1899; then the boom resumed. From 1908, the [[Japanese Brazilian|Japanese]] arrived in great numbers, many destined for the plantations on fixed-term contracts. By 1920, São Paulo was Brazil's second-largest city; a half-century before, it had been just the tenth-largest. Immigration and migration of Paulistas from other towns as well as Nordestinos and citizens from other states, the coffee industry, and modernization through the manufacturing of textiles, car and airplane parts, as well as food and technological industries, construction, fashion, and services transformed the greater São Paulo area into a thriving [[megalopolis (city type)|megalopolis]] and one of the world's greatest [[multiethnic]] regions.

===Early 20th century===
[[File:Imigrantes italianos na Hospedaria dos Imigrantes.jpg|thumb|[[italian Brazilian|Italian immigrants]] arriving in São Paulo.]]
Between 1901 and 1910, coffee made up 51 percent of Brazil's total exports, far overshadowing rubber, sugar and cotton. But reliance on coffee made Brazil (and São Paulo in particular) vulnerable to poor harvests and the whims of world markets. The development of plantations in the 1890s, and widespread reliance on credit, took place against fluctuating prices and supply levels, culminating in saturation of the international market around the start of the 20th century. The government's policies of "[[valorisation]] "—borrowing money to buy coffee and stockpiling it, in order to have a surplus during bad harvests, and meanwhile taxing coffee exports to pay off loans—seemed feasible in the short term (as did its manipulation of foreign-exchange rates to the advantage of coffee growers). But in the longer term, these actions contributed to oversupply and eventual collapse.

São Paulo's industrial development, from 1889 into the 1940s, was gradual and inward looking. Initially, industry was closely associated with agriculture: cotton plantations led to the growth of [[textile manufacturing]]. Coffee planters were among the early industrial investors.

The boom in [[Immigration to Brazil|immigration]] provided a market for goods, and sectors such as food processing grew. Traditional [[immigrant]] families such as the [[Eduardo Suplicy|Matarazzo]], [[Abílio dos Santos Diniz|Diniz]], Mofarrej and [[Paulo Maluf|Maluf]] became industrialists, entrepreneurs, and leading politicians.

Restrictions on imports forced by world wars and government policies of "import substitution" and trade tariffs, all contributed to industrial growth. By 1945, São Paulo had become the largest industrial center in South America. World War I sent ripples through Brazil. Inflation was rampant. Some 50,000 workers went on strike.

The growing of the [[urban population]] grew increasingly resentful of the coffee elite. Disaffected intellectuals expressed their views during a memorable "Week of Modern Art" in 1922. Two years later, a garrison of [[soldier]]s staged a revolt (eventually quashed by government troops).

The stand-off was also political: politics had been long monopolised by the Paulista Republican Party, but in 1926 a more left-leaning party rose in opposition. In 1928, the PRP amended São Paulo's state constitution to give it more control over the city. The turbulence was mirrored on Brazil's national scene. With the [[Great Depression]], coffee prices plunged, as did real [[GDP]]. Americans, keen investors during the 1920s, backed away.

The opening of the first highway between São Paulo and Rio in 1928 was one of the few bright spots. Into the breach stepped [[Getúlio Vargas]], a southerner veteran in state politics. In Brazil's [[Brazilian general election, 1930|1930 presidential elections]], he opposed [[Júlio Prestes]], a favorite son of São Paulo. Vargas lost the election, but with backing from Minas Gerais state—São Paulo's former ally and neighbor to the north—he seized power regardless.

===Constitutionalist Revolution===

[[File:Schneider-Canet_150mm_na_Revolução_de_1932.jpg|thumb|upright|A Schneider-Canet 150mm cannon used during the [[Constitutionalist Revolution|Paulista War]].]]
The [[Constitutionalist Revolution of 1932]] or Paulista War is the name given to the uprising of the population of the Brazilian state of São Paulo against the federal government of Vargas. Its main goal was to press the provisional government headed by Getúlio Vargas to enact a new Constitution, since it had revoked the previous one, adopted in 1889. However, as the movement developed and resentment against President Vargas grew deeper, it came to advocate the overthrow of the Federal Government and the secession of São Paulo from the Brazilian federation. But, it is noted that the separatist scenario was used as guerrilla tactics by the Federal Government to turn the population of the rest of the country against the state of São Paulo, broadcasting the alleged separatist notion throughout the country. There is no evidence that the movement's commanders sought separatism.

The uprising started on 9 July 1932, after five protesting students were killed by government troops on 23 May 1932. On the wake of their deaths, a movement called [[MMDC]] (from the initials of the names of each of the four students killed, Martins, Miragaia, Dráusio and Camargo) started. A fifth victim, Alvarenga, was also shot that night, but died months later.

Revolutionary troops entrenched in the battlefield. In a few months, the state of São Paulo rebelled against the federal government. Counting on the solidarity of three other powerful states, (Rio Grande do Sul, Minas Gerais and Rio de Janeiro), the politicians of São Paulo expected a quick war. However, that solidarity was never translated into actual support, and the São Paulo civil war was won by the Federation on 2 October 1932.

In spite of its military defeat, some of the movement's main demands were finally granted by Vargas afterwards: the appointment of a non-military state Governor, the election of a Constituent Assembly and, finally, the enactment of a new Constitution in 1934. However that Constitution was short lived, as in 1937, amidst growing extremism on the left and right wings of the political spectrum, Vargas closed the National Congress and enacted another Constitution, which established an authoritarian regime called [[Estado Novo (Brazil)|Estado Novo]].

===Late 20th century===
[[File:Webysther_20190306131041_-_Edifício_Altino_Arantes.jpg|thumb|upright|left|220px|[[Altino Arantes Building]] in [[São Paulo]], opened in 1947.]]
Vargas's rule was a study in political turbulence. Elected in 1934, he ruled by dictatorship (albeit a popular one, thanks to his health and social-welfare programmes) from 1937 to 1945—a period dubbed the "Estado Novo". Thrown out by a coup in 1945, he ran for office again in 1950, and was overwhelmingly elected. On the verge of being overthrown from office again, he committed suicide in 1954. Vargas's main legacy was the centralization of power.

The encouragement of industry and diversification of agriculture, not to mention the abolition of subsidies on coffee, finally did away with the dominance of the coffee oligarchies. His replacement, [[Juscelino Kubitschek]], focused on heavy industry. Kubitschek built car factories, steel plants, hydro-power infrastructure and roads. [[Petrobras]], Brazil's oil monolith, was set up in 1953. By 1958, São Paulo state controlled some 55 percent of Brazil's industrial production, up from 17 percent in 1907. Another of Kubitschek's pet projects was the creation of [[Brasília]], which became Brazil's capital in 1960—the year Kubitschek stepped down. The [[University of São Paulo]] was founded in 1934; two years after São Paulo's failed uprising. It has established itself as the most prestigious higher learning institution in the country.

With a transitional government from military to civil and a new currency that made stagnant the economy during the mid- to late 1980s, unemployment and crime became rampant. São Paulo, by now the world's third-largest city after [[Mexico City]] and [[Tokyo]], was hard-hit. Wealthy Brazilians retreated to suburban highly secured housing complexes such as [[Alphaville, São Paulo|Alphaville]], and ''[[favelas]]'', pockets of substandard living slums that lined the periphery, had a tremendous growth. For the first time in history, Brazil experienced large segments of its population immigrating to continents such as [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]], and [[East Asia]], particularly to [[Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

=== Climate ===
[[File:São Paulo Köppen.svg|left|thumb|227x227px|Köppen climate types of São Paulo]]

The state territory covers seven distinct climatic types, taking into account the temperature and rainfall. In the mountain areas of the state, there are [[subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' in [[Köppen climate classification]]), in areas of high altitude such as the Serra do Mar and the Serra da Mantiqueira, having humid, hot summers and average temperatures below {{convert|18|°C}} in the month cooler year; and [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] (''Cfb'' and ''Cwb'') with regular and well distributed throughout the year and warmer summers rains.<ref name="Clima_CEPAGRI">{{cite web |url=http://www.cpa.unicamp.br/outras-informacoes/clima-dos-municipios-paulistas.html |title=A CLASSIFICAÇÃO CLIMÁTICA DE KOEPPEN PARA O ESTADO DE SÃO PAULO. |author=MIRANDA, Marina J. de. |display-authors=etal |publisher=Centro de Pesquisas Meteorológicas e Aplicadas à Agricultura (CEPAGRI) |access-date=11 February 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219224353/http://www.cpa.unicamp.br/outras-informacoes/clima-dos-municipios-paulistas.html |archive-date=19 February 2014 |language=pt |url-status=live }}</ref>

On the coast, the climate is super-humid tropical type, very similar to the prevailing [[equatorial climate]] in the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] (''Af''), with rainfall exceeding sixty monthly millimeters in every month of the year, without the existence of a dry season. The tropical climate of altitude (''Cwa''), predominant in the state territory, specifically in the center of the state, is characterized by a summer rainy season and a dry season in winter, with temperatures above {{convert|22|°C}} in the hottest month of the year. In other areas, there is [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') with rainfall less than {{convert|60|mm|1}} in one or more months of the year and warmer, with average temperatures above {{convert|18|°C}} during the year. There are also small areas with characteristics of [[monsoon]]s (''Am'').<ref name="Clima_CEPAGRI"/>

=== Environment ===
São Paulo's territory is located, for the most part, in the [[Atlantic Forest|Atlantic Forest biome]], whose initial formation covered just over two thirds of São Paulo's territory and today is only spread out in several fragments, with 32.6% of the original remnants remaining today, most of it on the slopes of Serra do Mar. In the [[Cerrado|cerrado biome]], typical of areas in the center-west of São Paulo, this number is even lower, at just 3%. On the coast there are small areas of [[dune]]s, with plant species adapted to heat and salinity, in addition to [[restinga]]s and [[mangrove]]s, the latter at the mouths of rivers. As it is located at the junction of the [[Tropical climate|tropical]] and [[Temperate climate|temperate zones]] of the planet, São Paulo has its fauna and flora made up of species from both tropical and [[Subtropics|subtropical]] regions, some of which are endemic.<ref name="inventarioflorestal2020">{{cite web |access-date=11 February 2024 |author=Secretaria de Infraestrutura e Meio Ambiente do Estado de São Paulo |date=2020 |title=INVENTÁRIO FLORESTAL DO ESTADO DE SÃO PAULO: MAPEAMENTO DA COBERTURA VEGETAL NATIVA |url=https://smastr16.blob.core.windows.net/home/2020/07/inventarioflorestal2020.pdf |archive-date=26 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210426143405/https://smastr16.blob.core.windows.net/home/2020/07/inventarioflorestal2020.pdf |url-status=live }}<!-- auto-translated from Portuguese by Module:CS1 translator --></ref>

In Brazil, the [[automotive]] sector represents about 22% of industrial GDP. [[ABC Paulista]] is the first center and largest automobile center in Brazil. When the country's manufacturing was practically restricted to ABC, the State represented 74.8% of Brazilian production in 1990. In 2017, this index decreased to 46.6%, and in 2019, to 40.1%, due to a phenomenon of internalization of vehicle production in Brazil, driven by factors such as unions, which made payroll and labor burdens excessively burdensome, discouraged investment, and favored the search for new cities. The development of ABC cities has also helped curb the appeal, due to rising real estate costs and a higher density of residential areas.

Despite registering one of the largest sales in the sector in the world, the Brazilian chemical industry, in 2012 and 2013, experienced a strong transfer of production abroad, with a drop in national industrial production and an increase in imports. A third of consumption in the country was supplied by imports. 448 products stopped being manufactured in Brazil between 1990 and 2012. This led to the interruption of 1,710 production lines. In 1990, the share of imported products in Brazilian consumption was only 7%, in 2012 it was 30%. The main companies in the sector in Brazil are: [[Braskem]], [[BASF]], [[Bayer]], among others. In 2018, the Brazilian chemical sector was the eighth largest in the world, representing 10% of national industrial GDP and 2.5% of total GDP. In 2020, imports will occupy 43% of the internal demand for chemical products.

In the [[Pharmaceutical Industry]], most companies in Brazil have been established in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro for a long time. In 2019, the situation was that, due to the tax advantages offered in states like Pernambuco, Goiás and Minas Gerais, companies left RJ and SP and went to these states.

The companies that benefited the most from the sale of medicines in the country in 2015 were [[EMS (pharmaceuticals)|EMS]], [[Hypermarcas]] (NeoQuímica), [[Sanofi]] (Medley), [[Novartis]], [[Aché (company)|Aché]], [[Eurofarma]], [[Takeda Pharmaceutical Company|Takeda]], Bayer, [[Pfizer]] and [[GlaxoSmithKline|GSK]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ascoferj.com.br/noticias/rio-de-janeiro-por-que-a-industria-farmaceutica-nao-o-quer/ |title=Rio de Janeiro: por que a indústria farmacêutica não o quer? |date=4 October 2019 |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=13 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200713235046/https://ascoferj.com.br/noticias/rio-de-janeiro-por-que-a-industria-farmaceutica-nao-o-quer/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://science.talknmb.com.br/mercado-farmaceutico-brasileiro/ |title=Saiba como está a competição no mercado farmacêutico brasileiro |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=22 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201022152040/https://science.talknmb.com.br/mercado-farmaceutico-brasileiro/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://exame.com/negocios/roche-investe-r-300-milhoes-na-fabrica-do-rio-de-janeiro/ |title=Roche investe R$ 300 milhões na fábrica do Rio de Janeiro |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=16 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200616005550/https://exame.com/negocios/roche-investe-r-300-milhoes-na-fabrica-do-rio-de-janeiro/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the [[footwear industry]], in 2019 Brazil produced 972 million pairs. Exports were around 10%, reaching almost 125 million pairs. Brazil ranks fourth among world producers, behind China, India and Vietnam, and 11th among the largest exporters. Of the pairs produced, 49% were made of plastic or rubber, 28.8% were made of synthetic laminate, and only 17.7% were made of leather. The largest polo in Brazil is located in Rio Grande do Sul, but São Paulo has important shoe centers, such as the one in the city of [[Franca]], specialized in men's footwear, in the city of Jaú, specialized in women's footwear and in the city of [[Birigui]], specialized in children's footwear. Jaú, Franca and Birigui represent 92% of footwear production in the state of São Paulo. Birigui has 350 companies, which generate around 13 thousand jobs, producing 45.9 million pairs per year. 52% of children's shoes in the country are produced in this city. From Birigui came the majority of the most famous children's shoe factories in the country. Jaú has 150 factories that produce around 130 thousand pairs of cheap women's shoes per day. The footwear sector in Franca has around 550 companies and employs around 20,000 employees. Most of the country's most famous men's shoe factories come from São Paulo. Overall, however, the Brazilian industry has been struggling to compete with Chinese footwear, which has an unbeatable price due to the difference in tax collection from one country to another, in addition to the absence of strong Brazilian labor taxes in China. Brazilian businessmen have had to invest in value-added products, combining quality and design, in order to survive.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fenac.com.br/producao-de-calcados-deve-crescer-3-em-2019 |title=Produção de calçados deve crescer 3% em 2019 |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=1 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191101151709/http://www.fenac.com.br/producao-de-calcados-deve-crescer-3-em-2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abicalcados.com.br/noticia/abicalcados-apresenta-relatorio-setorial-2019 |title=Abicalçados apresenta Relatório Setorial 2019 |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=21 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021110802/https://www.abicalcados.com.br/noticia/abicalcados-apresenta-relatorio-setorial-2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.fazcomex.com.br/blog/exportacao-de-calcados-saiba-mais/ |title=Exportação de Calçados: Saiba mais |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=17 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617022014/https://www.fazcomex.com.br/blog/exportacao-de-calcados-saiba-mais/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://blog.danielatacado.com.br/polos-calcadistas/ |title=Saiba quais são os principais polos calçadistas do Brasil |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=12 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200812084155/http://blog.danielatacado.com.br/polos-calcadistas/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://g1.globo.com/sp/ribeirao-preto-franca/noticia/2019/07/14/industrias-calcadistas-em-franca-sp-registram-queda-de-40percent-nas-vagas-de-trabalho-em-6-anos.ghtml |title=Industrias calcadistas em Franca SP registram queda de 40% nas vagas de trabalho em 6 anos |date=14 July 2019 |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=14 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190714205803/https://g1.globo.com/sp/ribeirao-preto-franca/noticia/2019/07/14/industrias-calcadistas-em-franca-sp-registram-queda-de-40percent-nas-vagas-de-trabalho-em-6-anos.ghtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the [[textile industry]], Brazil, despite being among the 5 largest producers in the world in 2013, and being representative in the consumption of textiles and clothing, has very little insertion in world trade. In 2015, Brazilian imports ranked 25th (US$5.5 billion). And in exports, it was only 40th in the world ranking. Brazil's share of world textile and clothing trade is only 0.3%, due to the difficulty of competing in price with producers from India and mainly from China. The gross value of production, which includes the consumption of intermediate goods and services, of the Brazilian textile industry corresponded to almost R $40 billion in 2015, 1.6% of the gross value of industrial production in Brazil. São Paulo (37.4%) is the largest producer. The main productive areas of São Paulo are the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo and Campinas.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bnb.gov.br/documents/80223/2509338/textil_16_2017%28V2%29.pdf/063d7521-342f-e81e-232a-e251964fa1c3 |title=Industria Textil no Brasil |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=2 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210702131512/https://www.bnb.gov.br/documents/80223/2509338/textil_16_2017(V2).pdf/063d7521-342f-e81e-232a-e251964fa1c3 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In [[Electronics industry]], the billing of industries in Brazil reached R $153.0 billion in 2019, about 3% of national GDP. The number of employees in the sector was 234.5 thousand people. Exports were $5.6 billion, and the country's imports were $32.0 billion. Brazil, despite decades-long efforts to rid itself of dependence on technology imports, has yet to reach this level. Imports are concentrated on expensive components such as processors, microcontrollers, memories, magnetic disks, lasers, LEDs and LCDs mounted below. The cables for telecommunications and electricity distribution, cables, optical fibers and connectors are manufactured in the country. Brazil has two large centers for the production of electronic products, located in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, in the State of São Paulo, and in the Free Trade Zone of Manaus, in the State of Amazonas. There are large, internationally renowned technology companies as well as part of the industries that participate in its supply chain. The country also has other smaller centers, such as the municipalities of São José dos Campos and [[São Carlos]], in the state of São Paulo. In Campinas there are industrial units of groups such as [[General Electric]], [[Samsung]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]] and [[Foxconn]], a manufacturer of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Dell]] products. São José dos Campos, focuses on the aviation industry. This is where the headquarters of [[Embraer]] is located, a Brazilian company that is the third largest aircraft manufacturer in the world, after Boeing and Airbus. In the production of cell phones and other electronic products, Samsung produces in Campinas; [[LG]] produces in [[Taubaté]]; Flextronics, which produces [[Motorola]] cell phones, produces in [[Jaguariúna]]; and [[Toshiba|Semp-TCL]] produces in [[Cajamar, São Paulo|Cajamar]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://g1.globo.com/sp/campinas-regiao/noticia/2020/03/02/fabricante-da-motorola-mantem-operacao-reduzida-por-conta-de-coronavirus-e-reveza-ferias-coletivas.ghtml |title=Fabricante da Motorola mantém operação reduzida por conta de coronavírus e reveza férias coletivas |date=2 March 2020 |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=17 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617153803/https://g1.globo.com/sp/campinas-regiao/noticia/2020/03/02/fabricante-da-motorola-mantem-operacao-reduzida-por-conta-de-coronavirus-e-reveza-ferias-coletivas.ghtml |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.abinee.org.br/abinee/decon/decon15.htm |title=Desempenho do Setor - DADOS ATUALIZADOS EM ABRIL DE 2020 |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=10 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220910070124/http://www.abinee.org.br/abinee/decon/decon15.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mapa_Eletr%C3%B4nicos2015.pdf |title=A indústria eletroeletrônica do Brasil – Levantamento de dados |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=21 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121052033/https://reporterbrasil.org.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Mapa_Eletr%C3%B4nicos2015.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Historical records about São Paulo's tourism date back to the 17th century, in the well-known travel reports about the territory of Brazil, which were made by [[Exploration|explorers]] and travelers who examined new lands. However, the first known work written specifically about the [[São Paulo Province]] is "The trip to São Paulo in the summer of 1813" ("A viagem de São Paulo do verão de 1813"), by Gustavo Beyer; there, the author noted that "the [[Captaincy of São Paulo]] was considered a paradise in Brazil because of its altitude, its healthy and fresh air and its hospitable inhabitants". After this publication, many others of the genre appeared, such as the [[Watercolor painting|watercolor]] "The Navel of São Paulo" (1827), by [[Jean-Baptiste Debret]], and works and/or reports by [[Augustin Saint-Hilaire]] (1819), [[Hércules Florence]] (1826) and [[Daniel Parish Kidder|Daniel Kidder]] (1837). During the 19th century, the movement of people within the national territory grew with the advent of new means of transport, mainly rail, and it was in the 20th century that São Paulo emerged as the main entry point for people in Brazil from different parts of the world due to its large supply of work, hotels, transport, leisure, entertainment and culture, as well as cities with a high quality of life, which was reflected (and still is reflected in the 21st century) in the large numbers of tourists. The capital was the scene of many of the country's main historical events. In the state, there are numerous cities, monuments and buildings listed by [[Council for the Defense of Historical, Archaeological, Artistic and Tourist Heritage|CONDEPHAAT]], [[Municipal Council for the Preservation of the Historical, Cultural and Environmental Heritage of the City of São Paulo|CONPRESP]] and [[National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage|IPHAN]] due to their importance as state and national [[Cultural heritage|historical heritage]], as well as sites considered [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]] and natural areas declared [[Man and the Biosphere Programme|Biosphere Reserves of the Planet]] by UNESCO.<ref name="Nova2009">[[#Nova|Madalena Rodrigues Nova]]: 2009, p. 29</ref>

São Paulo has three tourism hubs: the capital, the coast and the interior.

[[Congonhas-São Paulo Airport]] or just Congonhas Airport {{Airport codes|CGH|SBSP}} is one of São Paulo's three commercial airports, situated 8 [[kilometre]]s (5 [[mile]]s) from the city downtown at [[Washington Luís]] Avenue, in the Campo Belo district. It is owned by the City of São Paulo and managed by [[Infraero]]. In 2013, it was the [[List of the busiest airports in Brazil|busiest airport]] in Brazil in terms of aircraft movements and the second busiest in terms of passengers, handling 209,555 aircraft movements and 17,119,530 passengers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.infraero.gov.br/images/stories/Estatistica/2013/ret/dez.pdf |title=Airport Statistics for 2013 |access-date=9 January 2015 |archive-date=28 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928205653/http://www.infraero.gov.br/images/stories/Estatistica/2013/ret/dez.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Located 14 kilometers from downtown Campinas and 99 kilometers from the city of São Paulo, [[Viracopos-Campinas International Airport]] {{Airport codes|VCP|SBKP}} can be reached by three highways: Santos Dumont, Bandeirantes and Anhanguera. The city of Campinas is one of Brazil's leaders in [[technology]]. Besides excellent highway connections, it is the location of major universities and many high-tech companies. Because of this, the airport is one of Infraero's highest investment priorities. The old "landing field" as it was called has become one of the main connection points in Latin America.

The air cargo import/export terminal of Campinas has an area of over 81,000 square meters. The airport began to concentrate in the international air cargo sector in the 1990s and today this is the airports leading source of revenue. Since 1995, Infraero has been investing to implement the first phase of the airport's master plan, making major improvements to the cargo and passenger terminals. The first phase was completed in the first half of 2004, when the [[airport]] received new departure and arrival lounges, public areas and commercial concessions. In 2012, the airport received a [[Viracopos International Airport#Airlines and destinations|new terminal]], it has since been privatized.

====Railways====
[[File:Spmetropolitanomontagem.jpg|thumb|276x276px|[[São Paulo Metro]] (subway) urban transit system, one of the best and cleanest metro systems in the world]]
In rail transport, the state has more than {{cvt|5000|km|mi|abbr=on}} of railways, which comes from the banks of the Parana River on the border of São Paulo and Mato Grosso do Sul, to the Port of Santos, on the Atlantic coast, for the carriage of goods. The first of such [[urban transit]] systems in Brazil and South America, it began operations in 1974. It consists of four color-coded lines: Line 1-Blue, Line 2-Green, Line 3-Red and Line 5-Lilac; Line 4-Yellow started to work in May 2010, and will be completed only in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/geral,metro-tera-primeira-estacao-fora-de-sp-so-em-2016,871659 |title=Metrô terá primeira estação fora de SP só em 2016 |publisher=[[O Estado de S.

The metro system carries 2.8 million passengers a day. Metro itself is far from covering the entire urban area in the city of São Paulo. Another company, [[Companhia Paulista de Trens Metropolitanos]] (CPTM), ["São Paulo Metropolitan Train Company"] works along with the metro system and runs additional [[commuter]] railways converted into [[light rail]] service lines, which total six lines (numbers 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12), 261&nbsp;km long, serving 89 stations. Metro and CPTM are integrated through various stations. Metro and CPTM both operate as state-owned companies, and have received awards in the recent past as one of the cleanest systems in the world by ISO9001. The São Paulo metro transports three million people by day. A [[Trens Intercidades|regional rail]] network is also proposed.

====Highways====

The State of São Paulo has more dual carriageways than any country in Latin America with the exception of Mexico, and, according to a survey by the Confederação Nacional do Transporte (''National Transport Confederation''), the road system of the state is the best in Brazil, with 59.4% of its roads classified as "excellent".<ref name="DER">http://www.der.sp.gov.br/institucional/todasnoticias.aspx?ID_Noticias=66 {{Dead link|date=February 2022 }}</ref> The survey also found that of the 10 best Brazilian highways, nine are in São Paulo.<ref name="DER"/>

The São Paulo highway system, however, is heavily criticized for the high cost imposed on its users. The state of São Paulo concentrates more than half of the [[toll road]]s in Brazil and a new toll plaza is created every 40 days average. According to a report of the ''[[Folha de S. Paulo]]'', the cost of tolls to travel the coastal path of {{cvt|4500|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the federal highway [[BR-101]], which connect [[Rio Grande do Norte]] to [[Rio Grande do Sul]], is cheaper than to go through the {{cvt|313|km|mi|abbr=on}} of highways separating the [[List of municipalities in São Paulo|municipalities]] of São Paulo and Ribeirão Preto.<ref>{{cite web |first=Izidoro |last=Alencar |title=Pedágio para cruzar o país pela BR-101 é menor que no Estado de SP |url=http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/cotidiano/ult95u669985.shtml |publisher=[[Folha de S.Paulo]] |access-date=2 February 2015 |date=22 December 2009 |language=pt }}</ref> The prices charged by private concessionaires who run the system are frequent targets of complaints from drivers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://noticias.r7.com/sao-paulo/noticias/estado-de-sao-paulo-ganha-um-pedagio-a-cada-40-dias-20100628.html |title=Estado de São Paulo ganha um pedágio a cada 40 dias – São Paulo – R7 |date=5 July 2012 |publisher=r7.com |access-date=2 February 2015 |language=pt |archive-date=2 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150202174749/http://noticias.r7.com/sao-paulo/noticias/estado-de-sao-paulo-ganha-um-pedagio-a-cada-40-dias-20100628.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
