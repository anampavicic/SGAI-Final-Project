==Names and etymology==
{{see also|Names of Edirne in different languages}}
The city was founded and named after the Roman emperor [[Hadrian]] as ''Hadrianopolis'' ({{lang|en|Adrianople}} in English, {{IPAc-en|ˌ|eɪ|d|r|i|ə|ˈ|n|oʊ|p|əl}}; {{lang|grc|Ἁδριανούπολις}} in [[Greek language|Greek]]) on the site of the Greek city of [[Orestias]], which was itself founded on an earlier [[Thracians|Thracian]] settlement named ''Uskudama.''<ref name="Britannica_Edirne">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Edirne|title=Edirne|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=31 May 2018}}</ref> The Ottoman name ''Edrine'' (ادرنه) is derived from the Greek name. The name ''Adrianople'' was used in English until the Turkish adoption of the Latin alphabet in 1928, after which ''Edirne'' became the internationally recognised name.

The area around Edirne has been the site of [[Battle of Adrianople (disambiguation)|numerous major battles and sieges]] starting from the days of the [[Roman Empire]]. The vagaries of the border region between Asia and Europe gave rise to Edirne's claim to be the most frequently contested spot on earth.<ref>{{cite book |title=A History of Warfare |first=John |last=Keegan |author-link=John Keegan |pages=[https://archive.org/details/historyofwarfare00keeg/page/70 70–71] |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=1993 |isbn=0-7126-9850-7|title-link=A History of Warfare }}</ref>

===Antiquity===

The city was reestablished by the Roman Emperor [[Hadrian]] on the site of [[Orestias]] (named after its mythological founder [[Orestes]]), which was itself built on a previous [[List of ancient Thracian cities|Thracian settlement]] known as ''Uskadama'', ''Uskudama'', ''Uskodama'' or ''Uscudama''.<ref name="Britannica_Edirne"/> Hadrian developed it, adorned it with monuments, and changed its name to ''Hadrianopolis'' (which would later be pronounced ''Adrianopolis'' and [[Anglicisation|Anglicised]] as ''Adrianople''). [[Licinius]] was [[Battle of Adrianople (324)|defeated here]] by [[Constantine I]] in 324, and Emperor [[Valens]] was killed by the [[Goths]] here during the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378.
[[File:Edirne Roman Walls and Macedonian Tower 0208.jpg|thumb|The remains of Roman and Byzantine fortifications next to the so-called "Macedonian tower".]]

===Medieval and early Ottoman periods===
In 813, the city was temporarily seized by [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Krum of Bulgaria]] who moved its inhabitants to the [[Bulgarian lands across the Danube|Bulgarian lands north of the Danube]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Bulgarian-Byzantine Wars for Early Medieval Balkan Hegemony: silver-lined skulls and blinded armies|last=Hupchick|first=Dennis|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2017|isbn=9783319562056|location=US|pages=107}}</ref>

During the period of the [[Latin Empire]] of Constantinople, the Crusaders were defeated by the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Emperor]] [[Kaloyan]] at the [[Battle of Adrianople (1205)|Battle of Adrianople]] in 1205. In 1206 the Latin regime gave Adrianople and the surrounding area to the Byzantine aristocrat [[Theodore Branas]] as a hereditary fief.<ref>Saint-Guillain, G. (1216) ''Identities and Allegiances in the Eastern Mediterranean after 1204'', Routledge, p. 66</ref> [[Theodore Komnenos Doukas|Theodore Komnenos]], [[Despot of Epirus]], took possession of it in 1227, but three years later [[Battle of Klokotnitsa|was defeated at Klokotnitsa]] by Emperor [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria]].

In 1362, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] under Sultan [[Murad I]] invaded Thrace and Murad [[Ottoman conquest of Adrianople|captured Adrianople]], probably in 1369 (the date is disputed). The city became "Edirne" in Turkish, reflecting the Turkish pronunciation<ref>"It served as the capital of the Ottoman Empire from 1413 until 1458 and flourished as an administrative, commercial, and cultural centre." [https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/179207/Edirne "Edirne"] ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''. Retrieved 19 December 2014</ref> and Murad moved the Ottoman capital here from [[Bursa]]. [[Mehmed the Conqueror]] (Sultan Mehmed II) was born in Adrianople, where he came under the influence of [[Hurufi]]s dismissed by [[Taşköprüzade]] in the ''Şakaiki Numaniye'' as '[[certain accursed ones of no significance]]', who were [[Burned at the stake|burnt]] as heretics by [[Mahmud Pasha Angelović|Mahmud Pasha]].<ref>John Kingsley Birge, ''The Bektashi Order of Dervishes'', 1982 (p 60 - 62)</ref>

The city remained the seat of Ottoman power until 1453, when Mehmed II took [[Ottoman Constantinople|Constantinople]] (present-day [[Istanbul]]) and moved the capital there. The importance of Edirne to the early Ottomans explains the plethora of early Ottoman [[mosque]]s, [[medrese]]s and other monuments that have survived until today although the Eski Sarayı (Old Palace) was largely destroyed, leaving only relatively slight remains. Also, there is evidence of a ''[[scriptorium]]'' in the Ottoman's Edirne palace during this period.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=A ́goston |first1=Ga ́bor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&dq=nakka%C5%9F+sinan+bey&pg=PA266 |title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire |last2=Masters |first2=Bruce Alan |date=2010-05-21 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=978-1-4381-1025-7 |pages=266 |language=en}}</ref>

[[Uzunköprü Bridge]], the world's longest medieval stone bridge, connects [[Anatolia]] with the [[Balkans]] on the Ergene River and was erected between 1426 and 1443 by the primary architect, [[Müslihiddin]], during the reign of Ottoman Sultan [[Murad II|Murat II]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-11-03 |title=Edirne, the city of history and culture |url=https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/edirne-the-city-of-history-and-culture-159672 |access-date=2023-08-15 |website=Hürriyet Daily News |language=en}}</ref>

===Later Ottoman period===
That Adrianople/Edirne continued to hold an important place in Ottoman hearts is reflected in the fact that Sultan [[Mehmed IV]] left the [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Constantinople]] to die here in 1693.
The wife of the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, [[Lady Mary Wortley Montagu]], spent six weeks in Edirne (then Adrianople) in the spring of 1717 and left an account of her experiences there in her ''The Turkish Embassy Letters''. Wearing Turkish dress, Montagu witnessed the passage of [[Ahmed III|Sultan Ahmed III]] to the mosque, visited the young wife-to-be of his vizier, [[Damat Ibrahim Pasha|Damad Ibrahim Pasha]] and was shown around the Selimiye Mosque.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Montagu |first=Lady Mary Wortley |title=The Turkish Embassy Letters |publisher=Virago |year=1994 |isbn=1853816795 |edition=1st |location=London |language=English}}</ref>

Adrianople was briefly occupied by imperial Russian troops in 1829 during the [[Greek War of Independence]] and in 1878 during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878]]. The city suffered a fire in 1905. At that time it had about 80,000 inhabitants, of whom 30,000 were Turks; 22,000 Greeks; 10,000 Bulgarians; 4,000 Armenians; 12,000 Jews; and 2,000 more citizens of unclassified ethnic/religious backgrounds.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Adrianople was a vital fortress defending [[Constantinople]] and [[Eastern Thrace]] during the [[Balkan Wars]] of 1912–13. It was briefly occupied by the Bulgarians in 1913, following the [[Siege of Adrianople (1912–13)|Siege of Adrianople]]. The Great Powers – Britain, Italy, France and Russia – attempted to coerce the Ottoman Empire into ceding Adrianople to [[Bulgaria]] during the temporary winter truce of the [[First Balkan War]]. The belief that the government was willing to give up the city created a scandal for the Ottoman government in Constantinople (as Adrianople was a former capital of the Empire), leading to the [[1913 Ottoman coup d'état]] led by the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP) under [[Enver Pasha]]. Although it was victorious in the coup,  the CUP was unable to stop the Bulgarians from capturing the city after fighting resumed in the spring. Despite relentless pressure from the Great Powers, the Ottoman empire never officially ceded the city to Bulgaria.

Edirne was swiftly reconquered by the Ottomans during the [[Second Balkan War]] under the leadership of [[Enver Pasha]] (who proclaimed himself the "second conqueror of Adrianople" after [[Murad I]]) following the collapse of the Bulgarian army in the region.

The entire Armenian population of the city was deported to Syria and Mesopotamia during the [[Armenian genocide]] on 27–28 October 1915 and 17–18 February 1916. Their property and businesses were sold at low prices to Turkish Muslims.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kévorkian |first1=Raymond |author1-link=Raymond Kévorkian |title=The Armenian Genocide: A Complete History |date=2011 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-0-85771-930-0 |language=en|pages=546–548}}</ref>

During the [[Greek War of Independence]], the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] (1912–1913), Balkan-Muslims fled to Edirne and became known as [[Muhacir]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/europe-on-the-road/forced-ethnic-migration/berna-pekesen-expulsion-and-emigration-of-the-muslims-from-the-balkans|title=Expulsion and Emigration of the Muslims from the Balkans|website=Ieg-ego.eu}}</ref>

==== Administrative arrangements ====
Adrianople was a [[sanjak]] centre during the Ottoman period and was bound to, successively, the [[Rumeli Eyalet]] and [[Silistre Eyalet]] before becoming a provincial capital of the Eyalet of Edirne at the beginning of the 19th century; until 1878, the Eyalet of Adrianople comprised the [[sanjak]]s of Edirne, [[Tekirdağ|Tekfurdağı]], [[Gelibolu]], [[Filibe]], and [[Sliven|İslimye]]. After land reforms in 1867, the Eyalet of Adrianople became the [[Vilayet of Adrianople]].

===Turkish Republic===
Adrianople/Edirne was ceded to Greece by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] in 1920, but recaptured and annexed by Turkey after the Greek defeat at the end of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–22)|Greco-Turkish War]], also known as the Western Front of the larger [[Turkish War of Independence]], in 1922. Under the Greek administration, Edirne (officially known as Adrianople) was the capital of the [[Adrianople Prefecture]].

From 1934 onwards Edirne was the seat of the [[Second Inspectorate General (Turkey)|Second Inspectorate General]], in which an Inspector General governed the provinces of [[Edirne Province|Edirne]], [[Çanakkale Province|Çanakkale]], [[Tekirdağ Province|Tekirdaĝ]] and [[Kırklareli Province|Kırklareli]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cagaptay|first=Soner|title=Islam, Secularism, and Nationalism in Modern Turkey; Who is a Turk|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|pages=47}}</ref> The Inspectorate Generals governmental posts were abandoned in 1948,<ref name=":02">{{Cite book|last=Bayir|first=Derya|title=Minorities and Nationalism in Turkish Law|date=2016-04-22|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-09579-8|page=141|language=en}}</ref> but the legal framework for them was only abolished in 1952 during the government of the [[Democrat Party (Turkey, 1946–1961)|Democrat Party]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bozarslan|first=Hamit|title=The Cambridge History of Turkey|date=2008-04-17|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-62096-3|editor-last=Fleet|editor-first=Kate|pages=343|language=en|editor-last2=Faroqhi|editor-first2=Suraiya|editor-last3=Kasaba|editor-first3=Reşat|editor-last4=Kunt|editor-first4=I.

Adrianople was made the seat of a Greek [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] and of an [[Armenian apostolic church|Armenian]] bishop. It is also the centre of a Bulgarian diocese but this is not recognised and has been deprived of a bishop. The city also had some Protestants. The few, mainly foreign Latin Catholics were dependent on the vicariate-apostolic of Constantinople. Adrianople also contained the parish of St. Anthony of Padua (Minors Conventual) and a school for girls conducted by the [[Sisters of Charity]] of [[Zagreb|Agram]]. The suburb of [[Karaağaç, Edirne|Karaağaç]] contained a church ([[Minor Conventuals]]), a school for boys (Assumptionists) and a school for girls (Oblates of the Assumption). Each of its mission stations, at [[Tekirdağ]] and [[Alexandroupoli]], had a school (Minor Conventuals), and there was one at [[Gallipoli]] (the Assumptionists).

Around 1850, from the standpoint of the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], Adrianople was the residence of a Bulgarian [[vicar-apostolic]] for the 4,600 Eastern Catholics of the Ottoman vilayet (province) of Thrace and after 1878 - of the [[principality of Bulgaria]]. They had eighteen parishes or missions, six of which were in the principality, with twenty churches or chapels, thirty-one priests, of whom six were [[Assumptionists]] and six were Resurrectionists; and eleven schools with 670 pupils. In Adrianople itself there were only a few United Bulgarians, with an Episcopal church of St. Elias, and the churches of St. Demetrius and Sts. Cyril and Methodius. The last is served by the [[Resurrectionist Order|Resurrectionists]], who also have a college with ninety pupils. In the suburb of Karaağaç, the [[Assumptionists]] have a parish and a seminary with fifty pupils. Besides the Eastern Catholic Bulgarians, the above statistics included the Greek Catholic missions of Malgara (now Malkara) and Daoudili (now Davuteli village in Malkara), with four priests and 200 faithful, because from the civil point of view belonged to the [[Bulgarian Exarchate|Bulgarian Vicariate]].

Later however, the Roman Catholic diocese was discontinued, and exists only in name as a [[titular see|titular metropolitan archbishopric]], under the full name ''Hadrianopolis in Haemimonto'' to distinguish it from several other titular sees named Hadrianopolis.

In 2018, archaeologists discovered remains of a [[Byzantine]] church. The church was built around 500 AD and it was an early Byzantine period building.<ref>[http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/photo-remains-of-1500-year-old-byzantine-church-found-in-turkeys-northwest-137660 Remains of 1500-year old Byzantine church found in Turkey's northwest]</ref>

Edirne is famed for its many mosques, medreses and other Ottoman monuments.

=== Mosques ===
The [[Selimiye Mosque (Edirne)|Selimiye Mosque]], built in 1575 and designed by Turkey's greatest architect, [[Mimar Sinan]] (c. 1489/1490–1588), is the most important monument in the city and became a UNESCO world heritage site in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Centre |first=UNESCO World Heritage |title=Selimiye Mosque and its Social Complex |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1366/ |access-date=2022-10-27 |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |language=en}}</ref> It used to have the highest [[minaret]]s in Turkey, at {{convert|70.90|m|ft|abbr=on}} before the completion of the [[Çamlıca Mosque]] in 2019 which features minarets standing at {{convert|107.1|m|ft|abbr=on}} tall. Sinan himself believed the dome to be higher than that of [[Hagia Sophia]], the former [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Orthodox Cathedral in [[Istanbul]], but modern measuring methods seem to suggest otherwise. Named after Sultan [[Selim II]] (r. 1566–1574) who commissioned it but did not live to see its completion, the mosque is decorated with Turkish marble and magnificent İznik tiles. It is the centre of a considerable complex of contemporary buildings.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Freely |first=John |title=Turkey Around The Marmara |publisher=SEV Matbaacılık ve Yayincılık |year=1998 |isbn=978-9758176199|edition=1st |location=Istanbul |pages=48–54 |language=English}}</ref>

Work started on the Eski Cami ([[Old Mosque, Edirne|Old Mosque]]) in1403 but was not completed until 1422. It was designed in what is usually thought of as the [[Bursa]] style. Even finer is the [[Üç Şerefeli Mosque|Üç Şerefli Mosque]] (Three-Balconied Mosque) which was built between 1437 and 1447 for Sultan Murad II. It was the largest mosque built in the Ottoman provinces before the [[conquest of Constantinople]]. Both these mosques are in the centre of Edirne.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Freely |first=John |title=Turkey Around The Marmara |publisher=SEV Matbaacılık ve Yayıncılık |year=1998 |isbn=978-9758176199|edition=1st |location=Istanbul |pages=40–2, 46–7 |language=English}}</ref>

Further away from the centre, the [[complex of Sultan Bayezid II|complex of Sultan Beyazid II]], built between 184 and 1488, and has a lovely semi-rural location. It is the most complete surviving mosque complex in Edirne, consisting of an ''imaret'' (soup kitchen), ''darüşşifa'' (hospital), ''timarhane'' (asylum), hospice, ''tıp medrese'' (medical school), ''tabhane'' (accommodation for dervishes) bakery and assorted depots. Some parts of the complex now house a museum to the history of Islamic medicine.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Freely |first=John |title=Turkey Around the Marmara |publisher=SEV Matbaacılıl ve Yayıncılık |year=1998 |isbn=978-9758176199|edition=1st |location=Istanbul |pages=59–63 |language=English}}</ref>

=== Edirne Palace ===
[[Edirne Palace]] ({{langx|ota|Saray-ı Cedid-i Amire}} for "New Imperial Palace") in the Sarayiçi quarter, was built in the reign of [[Murad II]] (r. 1421–1444) but was destroyed in 1877, during  the Russo-Turkish War. The palace gate and kitchen have since been restored. The ''Kasr-ı Adalet'' ("Justice Castle"), originally built as part of the palace complex, stands intact next to the small [[Fatih Bridge]] over the [[Tundzha|Tunca]] river.<ref name="evdb3saraylar">{{cite web |date=25 December 2006 |title=Saraylar |url=http://www.edirnevdb.gov.tr/kultur/saraylar.html |access-date=9 May 2015 |publisher=Edirne Vergi Dairesi Başkanlığı |language=tr}}</ref> The splendid appearance of the palace in the late 1460s when it glistened with gold, silver and marble was described by Kritovoulos of İmbros in his ''History of Mehmed the Conqueror.''

=== Other religious monuments ===
Dating back to 1909, the [[Grand Synagogue of Edirne]] was restored and re-opened in March 2015.<ref name="s1" /><ref name="cnnt1" /><ref name="h1" /> A Roman Catholic and two Bulgarian Orthodox churches are also to be found in the city.

=== Other historic monuments ===
Edirne has three historic covered [[bazaar]]s: the Kavaflar Arastası (Cobblers Arcade), next to the Selimiye Mosque and constructed to bring in an income to support the [[külliye]]; the Bedesten next to the Eski Cami which was supported by the income from the shops; and the Semiz Ali Paşa Çarşısı (Ali Pasha Bazaar, AKA Kapalı Çarşı), another work of [[Mimar Sinan|Sinan]] dating back to 1568.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Freely |first=John |title=Turkey Around the Marmara |publisher=SEV Matbaacılık ve Yayıncılık |year=1998 |isbn=978-9758176199|edition=1st |location=Istanbul |pages=42, 43, 48–9 |language=English}}</ref> The Kavaflar Arastası is the place to come to buy miniature versions of the handmade brooms with mirrors set into them that used to play a part in marriage ceremonies as well as to buy soap in the shape of fruits.

Of the original Roman Hadrianopolis only slight remains of the fortifications survive near the so-called Macedonian Tower,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fortifications and Macedonian Tower in Edirne {{!}} Turkish Archaeological News |url=https://turkisharchaeonews.net/object/fortifications-and-macedonian-tower-edirne |access-date=2022-10-27 |website=turkisharchaeonews.net}}</ref> itself probably a part of the defences although much patched-up and altered over the ensuing centuries.

[[Edirne Museum]] (Edirne Müzesi) contains collections of local archaeology and ethnography. In the grounds outside can be seen an example of the sort of dolmen to be seen at nearby Lalapaşa.

In the town centre stand the [[Rüstem Pasha Caravanserai (Edirne)|Rüstem Pasha]] (1560–61) and Ekmekcioğlu Ahmed Pasha [[caravanserai]]s, designed to accommodate travellers - in the case of the Rüstem Pasha by Mimar Sinan - in the 16th century. The Rüstem Pasha Caravanserai now serves as the Kervansaray Hotel.

The [[Balkan Wars Memorial Cemetery in Edirne|Balkan Wars Memorial Cemetery]] is located close to the ruins of the Edirne Palace, with an Unknown Soldier monument featuring an Ottoman soldier in front of its entrance.<ref name="evdb2">{{cite web |url=http://edirnevdb.gov.tr/kultur/anitlar.html |publisher=Edirne Vergi Dairesi Başkanlığı |title=Anıtlar |date=25 December 2006 |language=tr |access-date=9 May 2015 }}</ref>

The [[Maritsa|Meriç]] and [[Tundzha|Tunca]] rivers, which flow around west and south of the city, are crossed by elegant [[Bridges of Edirne|arched bridges]] dating back to early Ottoman times.

The historic [[Karaağaç railway station]] has been restored to house [[Trakya University]]'s Faculty of Fine Arts.<ref name="evdb2" /> The [[Treaty of Lausanne Monument and Museum]] are in the surrounding park.<ref name="evdb3" />

==Festivals==
[[File:Yagli_gures5.jpg|thumb|Oil-wrestling at [[Kırkpınar]]]]

Bocuk Gecesi is a festival of Balkan origin celebrated in mid-January on what is expected to be the coldest day of the year.

Edirne's economy largely depends on agriculture. 73% of the working population work in agriculture, fishing, forests and hunting. The lowlands are productive. Corn, sugar beets and sunflowers are the leading crops. Melons, watermelons, rice, tomatoes, eggplants and viniculture are important.

The through highway that connects Europe to [[Istanbul]], [[Anatolia]] and the Middle East passes through Edirne.

Industry is developing. Agriculture-based industries (agro-industries) are especially important for the city's economy.
