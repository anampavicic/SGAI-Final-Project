'''Bonn''' ({{IPA|de|bɔn|-|De-Bonn.ogg}}) is a [[federal city]] in the German state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], located on the banks of the [[Rhine]]. It has a population of over 300,000. About {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} south-southeast of [[Cologne]], Bonn is in the southernmost part of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] region, Germany's largest metropolitan area and the [[List of EU metropolitan areas by GDP|second biggest metropolitan region by GDP]] in the European Union, with over 11 million inhabitants. The city served as the capital of [[West Germany]] from its formation in 1949 until 1990 and as the capital of [[German reunification|reunited Germany]] from 1990 until 1999 when the seat of government was moved back to [[Berlin]]. Bonn is the birthplace of Germany's present day constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]].

Founded in the 1st century BC as an [[Ubii]] and then [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement in the province [[Germania Inferior]], Bonn is one of Germany's oldest cities. It was the [[capital city]] of the [[Electorate of Cologne]] from 1597 to 1794, residence of the Archbishops and Prince-electors of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|Cologne]]. From 1949 to 1990, Bonn was the capital of [[West Germany]]. The era when Bonn served as the capital of West Germany is referred to by historians as the ''[[Bonn Republic]]''.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Bonn Republic: West German Democracy, 1945–1990|author=Anthony James Nicholls|publisher=[[Longman]]|year=1997|isbn=9780582492318|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSvYAAAAIAAJ|via=[[Google Books]]}}</ref>

Due to a political compromise ([[Berlin-Bonn Act]]) following the reunification, the German federal government maintains a substantial presence in Bonn. Roughly a third of all ministerial jobs are located in Bonn {{as of|2019|lc=y}},<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/bonn-berlin-gesetz-101.html|title=Bonn-Berlin-Gesetz: Dieselbe Prozedur wie jedes Jahr|last=tagesschau.de|website=tagesschau.de|language=de|access-date=26 April 2019}}</ref> and the city is considered a second, unofficial, capital of the country.<ref name="Cowell">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/world/europe/24berlin.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220101/https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/24/world/europe/24berlin.html |archive-date=2022-01-01 |url-access=limited |title=In Germany's Capitals, Cold War Memories and Imperial Ghosts | work=[[The New York Times]] |first=Alan |last=Cowell |date=23 June 2011}}{{cbignore}}</ref> Bonn is the secondary seat of the [[President of Germany|President]], the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]], and the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], and the primary seat of six federal government ministries and twenty federal authorities.

==Geography==

{{wide image|General view over bonn.jpg|900px|View over central Bonn as seen from the Stadthaus, including the [[Siebengebirge]], a hill range on the east bank of the [[Middle Rhine]]|5=center}}

===Topography===
Situated in the southernmost part of the [[Rhine-Ruhr]] region, Germany's largest metropolitan area with over 11 million inhabitants, Bonn lies within the [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], on the border with [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. Spanning an area of more {{convert|141.2|km2|0|abbr=on}} on both sides of the river [[Rhine]], almost three-quarters of the city lies on the river's left bank.

To the south and to the west, Bonn borders the [[Eifel]] region which encompasses the [[Rhineland Nature Park]]. To the north, Bonn borders the [[Cologne Lowland]]. Natural borders are constituted by the river [[Sieg (river)|Sieg]] to the north-east and by the [[Siebengebirge]] (also known as the Seven Hills) to the east. The largest extension of the city in north–south dimensions is {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|12.5|km|0|abbr=on}} in west–east dimensions. The city borders have a total length of {{convert|61|km|0|abbr=on}}. The geographical centre of Bonn is the Bundeskanzlerplatz ''(Chancellor Square)'' in Bonn-Gronau.

=== Administration ===
The [[States of Germany|German state]] of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] is divided into five [[Regierungsbezirk|governmental districts]] ({{langx|de|link=no|Regierungsbezirk}}), and Bonn is part of the [[Regierungsbezirk Köln|governmental district of Cologne]] ({{langx|de|link=no|Regierungsbezirk Köln}}). Within this governmental district, the city of Bonn is an [[List of districts of Germany|urban district]] in its own right. The urban district of Bonn is then again divided into four administrative municipal districts ({{langx|de|link=no|Stadtbezirk}}). These are Bonn, Bonn-Bad Godesberg, Bonn-Beuel and Bonn-Hardtberg. In 1969, the independent towns of [[Bad Godesberg]] and Beuel as well as several villages were incorporated into Bonn, resulting in a city more than twice as large as before.

===Founding and Roman period===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2008}}
[[File:2008-12-25 Bonn Sterntor.jpg|left|thumb|The {{ill|Sterntor (Bonn)|de|Sterntor (Bonn)|lt=Sterntor}}, originally built {{Circa|1244|lk=no}}, is a gate reconstructed on the remnants of the medieval city wall.]]
The history of the city dates back to Roman times. In about 12 BC, the [[Roman army]] appears to have stationed a small unit in what is presently the historical centre of the city. Even earlier, the army had resettled members of a Germanic tribal group allied with Rome, the [[Ubii]], in Bonn. The Latin name for that settlement, "Bonna", may stem from the original population of this and many other settlements in the area, the [[Eburones|Eburoni]]. Bona is [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] for tribe.<ref>Xavier Delamarre, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'', Errance 2003. S. 82.</ref> The Eburoni were members of a large tribal coalition effectively wiped out during the final phase of [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s [[Gallic Wars|War in Gaul]]. After several decades, the army gave up the small camp linked to the Ubii-settlement. During the 1st century [[Anno Domini|AD]], the army then chose a site to the north of the emerging town in what is now the section of Bonn-Castell to build a large military installation dubbed [[Castra]] Bonnensis, i.e., literally, "Fort Bonn". Initially built from wood, the fort was eventually rebuilt in stone. With additions, changes and new construction, the fort remained in use by the army into the waning days of the [[Western Roman Empire]], possibly the mid-5th century. The structures themselves remained standing well into the [[Middle Ages]], when they were called the Bonnburg. They were used by [[Kingdom of the Franks|Frankish]] kings until they fell into disuse. Eventually, much of the building materials seem to have been re-used in the construction of Bonn's 13th-century [[Defensive wall|city wall]]. The {{ill|Sterntor (Bonn)|de|Sterntor|lt=Sterntor}} (''star gate'') in the city center is a reconstruction using the last remnants of the medieval city wall.

To date, Bonn's Roman fort remains the largest fort of its type known from the [[Ancient history|ancient world]], i.e. a fort built to accommodate a full-strength [[Roman legion|Imperial Legion]] and its auxiliaries. The fort covered an area of approximately {{convert|250000|m2|acre}}. Between its walls it contained a dense grid of streets and a multitude of buildings, ranging from spacious headquarters and large officers' quarters to [[barracks]], [[stable]]s and a [[Military prison|military jail]]. Among the legions stationed in Bonn, the "1st", i.e. the [[Legio I Minervia|Prima Legio Minervia]], seems to have served here the longest. Units of the Bonn legion were deployed to theatres of war ranging from modern-day [[Algeria]] to what is now the Russian republic of [[Chechnya]].

[[File:Altes Rathaus Bonn.jpg|thumb|The ''Altes Rathaus'' (old town hall) as seen from the central market square. It was built in 1737 in the [[Rococo]] style.]]The chief [[Roman roads|Roman road]] linking the provincial capitals of Cologne and [[Mainz]] cut right through the fort where it joined the fort's main road (now, Römerstraße). Once past the South Gate, the Cologne–Mainz road continued along what are now streets named Belderberg, Adenauerallee et al. On both sides of the road, the local settlement, ''Bonna'', grew into a sizeable Roman town. Bonn is shown on the 4th century [[Tabula Peutingeriana|Peutinger Map]].

In [[late antiquity]], much of the town seems to have been destroyed by marauding invaders. The remaining civilian population then took refuge inside the fort along with the remnants of the troops stationed here. During the final decades of Imperial rule, the troops were supplied by [[Franks|Franci]] chieftains employed by the Roman administration. When the end came, these troops simply shifted their allegiances to the new barbarian rulers, the [[Kingdom of the Franks]]. From the fort, the Bonnburg, as well as from a new medieval settlement to the South centered around what later became the [[Bonn Minster|minster]], grew the medieval city of Bonn. Local legends arose from this period that the name of the village came from [[Saint Boniface]] via [[Vulgar Latin]] ''*Bonnifatia'', but this proved to be a myth.

=== Middle ages and early modern period ===
[[File:University bonn at night.jpg|thumb|Founded in 1818, the [[University of Bonn]] counts [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Karl Marx|Marx]], and [[Konrad Adenauer|Adenauer]] among its alumni.]]
Between the 11th and 13th centuries, the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style Bonn Minster was built, and in 1597 Bonn became the seat of the [[Diocese|Archdiocese]] of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne|Cologne]]. The city gained more influence and grew considerably. The city was subject to a major bombardment during the [[Siege of Bonn (1689)|Siege of Bonn]] in 1689. Bonn was then returned to Cologne where it remained the capital at the [[Treaty of Ryswick|Peace of Ryswick]]. The [[Electorate of Cologne|elector]] [[Clemens August of Bavaria|Clemens August]] (ruled 1723–1761) ordered the construction of a series of [[Baroque]] buildings which still give the city its character. Another memorable ruler was [[Archduke Maximilian Francis of Austria|Max Franz]] (ruled 1784–1794), who founded the university and the spa quarter of [[Bad Godesberg]]. In addition he was a patron of the young [[Ludwig van Beethoven]], who was born in Bonn in 1770; the elector financed the composer's first journey to [[Vienna]].

In 1794, the city was seized by French troops, becoming a part of the [[First French Empire]]. In 1815 following the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Bonn became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. Administered within the Prussian [[Rhine Province]], the city became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the Prussian-led [[unification of Germany]]. Bonn was of little relevance in these years.

===20th century and the "Bonn Republic"===
{{See also|Berlin-Bonn Act|Decision on the Capital of Germany}}

During the [[Second World War]], Bonn acquired military significance because of its strategic location on the Rhine, which formed a natural barrier to easy penetration into the German heartland from the west. The Allied ground advance into Germany reached Bonn on 7 March 1945, and the US [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]] captured the city during the battle of 8–9 March 1945.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stanton|first=Shelby L.|title=World War II Order of Battle: An Encyclopedic Reference to U.S. Army Ground Forces from Battalion through Division, 1939–1946|edition=Revised |year=2006|publisher=[[Stackpole Books]]|page=76|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jfDfAQAACAAJ|isbn=9780811701570}}</ref>

[[Aftermath of World War II|After]] the Second World War, Bonn was in the British zone of occupation. Following the advocacy of West Germany's first chancellor, [[Konrad Adenauer]], a former Cologne Mayor and a native of that area, Bonn became the ''de facto'' capital, officially designated the "temporary seat of the Federal institutions," of the newly formed Federal Republic of Germany in 1949. However, the Bundestag, seated in Bonn's [[Bundeshaus (Bonn)|Bundeshaus]], affirmed [[Berlin]]'s status as the German capital. Bonn was chosen as the provisional capital and seat of government despite the fact that [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]] already had most of the required facilities and using Bonn was estimated to be 95 million DM more expensive than using Frankfurt. Bonn was chosen because Adenauer and other prominent politicians intended to make Berlin the capital of the reunified Germany, and they felt that locating the capital in a major city like Frankfurt or [[Hamburg]] would imply a permanent capital and even weaken support in West Germany for reunification.

In 1949, the [[Parlamentarischer Rat|Parliamentary Council]] in Bonn drafted and adopted the current German constitution, the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany]]. As the political centre of West Germany, Bonn saw six [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellors]] and six [[President of Germany|Presidents]] of the Federal Republic of Germany. Bonn's time as the capital of West Germany is commonly referred to as the ''[[Bonn Republic]]'', in contrast to the ''[[Berlin Republic]]'' which followed reunification in 1990.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Schleichende Wende.

===After national reunification===
[[File:Villa Hammerschmidt Bonn Seite Adenauerallee 20080831.jpg|left|thumb|Between 1950 and 1994, [[Hammerschmidt Villa|Villa Hammerschmidt]] was the primary official residence of the [[President of Germany]]. Today it serves as the President's secondary residence.]]
[[German reunification]] in 1990 made Berlin the nominal capital of Germany again. This decision, however, did not mandate that the republic's political institutions would also move. While some argued for the seat of government to move to Berlin, others advocated leaving it in Bonn – a situation roughly analogous to that of the [[Netherlands]], where [[Amsterdam]] is the capital but [[The Hague]] is the seat of government. Berlin's previous history as united Germany's capital was strongly connected with the [[German Empire]], the [[Weimar Republic]] and more ominously with both [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Prussia]]. It was felt that a new peacefully united Germany should not be governed from a city connected to such overtones of war. Additionally, Bonn was closer to [[Brussels]], headquarters of the [[European Economic Community]]. Former West German chancellor and mayor of [[West Berlin]] [[Willy Brandt]] caused considerable offence to the Western Allies during the debate by stating that France would not have kept the seat of government at [[Vichy France|Vichy]] after Liberation.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o36GDAAAQBAJ&q=Willy+Brandt++France+Vichy+capital&pg=PA149|title=Willy Brandt: a Political Biography|author=Barbara Marshall|date=18 December 1996|publisher=Springer|page=149|isbn=9780230390096}}</ref>

The heated debate that [[Decision on the Capital of Germany|resulted]] was settled by the ''[[Bundestag]]'' (Germany's parliament) only on 20 June 1991. By a vote of 338–320,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thelocal.de/20110615/35655|title=Bonn to Berlin move still controversial|work=The Local|date=15 June 2011|access-date=1 December 2020|language=en}}</ref> the Bundestag voted to move the seat of government to Berlin. The vote broke largely along regional lines, with legislators from the south and west favouring Bonn and legislators from the north and east voting for Berlin.<ref>{{cite web|title=Nationalatlas aktuell|url=http://aktuell.nationalatlas.de/Hauptstadtbeschluss.6_06-2011.0.html|website=Hauptstadtbeschluss|author=Sebastian Lentz|date=17 June 2011|access-date=20 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331093254/http://aktuell.nationalatlas.de/Hauptstadtbeschluss.6_06-2011.0.html|archive-date=31 March 2013|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Laux|first=Hans-Dieter|title=Berlin oder Bonn?

Ultimately, the votes of the [[New states of Germany#Culture|eastern German]] legislators tipped the balance in favour of Berlin.<ref>{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Wayne C. |year=2008 |title=The World Today Series: Nordic, Central and Southeastern Europe 2008 |publisher=Stryker-Post Publications |location=Harpers Ferry, West Virginia |isbn=978-1-887985-95-6}}</ref>

From 1990 to 1999, Bonn served as the seat of government of reunited Germany. In recognition of its former status as German capital, it holds the name of Federal City ({{langx|de|link=no|Bundesstadt}}). Bonn currently shares the status of Germany's seat of government with Berlin, with the [[President of Germany|President]], the [[Chancellor of Germany|Chancellor]] and many government ministries (such as [[Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture (Germany)|Food & Agriculture]] and [[Federal Ministry of Defence (Germany)|Defence]]) maintaining large presences in Bonn. Over 8,000 of the 18,000 federal officials remain in Bonn.<ref name="Cowell"/> A total of 19 United Nations (UN) institutions operate from Bonn today.

=== City council ===
[[File:2020 Bonn City Council election.svg|thumb|350px|Results of the 2020 city council election]]
The Bonn city council governs the city alongside the mayor. It used to be based in the [[Rococo]]-style ''{{lang|de|Altes Rathaus}}'' (old city hall), built in 1737, located adjacent to Bonn's central market square. However, due to the enlargement of Bonn in 1969 through the incorporation of Beuel and Bad Godesberg, it moved into the larger Stadthaus facilities further north. This was necessary for the city council to accommodate an increased number of representatives. The mayor of Bonn still sits in the ''{{lang|de|Altes Rathaus}}'', which is also used for representative and official purposes.

The most recent city council election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:

=== State government ===
Four delegates represent the Federal city of Bonn in the [[Landtag]] of [[Landtag of North Rhine-Westphalia|North Rhine-Westphalia]]. The last election took place in May 2022. The current delegates are Guido Déus ([[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]]), Christos Katzidis (CDU), Joachim Stamp ([[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]]), Tim Achtermeyer (Greens) and Dr. Julia Höller (Greens)

=== Federal government ===
Bonn's [[Electoral district|constituency]] is called ''{{lang|de|Bundeswahlkreis Bonn}}'' (096). In the [[German federal election, 2017|German federal election 2017]], [[Ulrich Kelber]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]) was elected a member of [[Bundestag|German Federal parliament, the Bundestag]] by direct mandate. It is his fifth term. [[Katja Dörner]] representing Bündnis 90/Die Grünen and [[Alexander Graf Lambsdorff]] for [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] were elected as well. Kelber resigned in 2019 because he was appointed [[Federal Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information]]. As Dörner was elected Lord Mayor of Bonn in September 2020, she resigned as a member of parliament after her entry into office.

== Culture ==
Beethoven's birthplace is located in Bonngasse near the market place. Next to the market place is the Old City Hall, built in 1737 in [[Rococo]] style, under the rule of [[Clemens August of Bavaria]]. It is used for receptions of guests of the city, and as an office for the mayor. Nearby is the ''[[Electoral Palace, Bonn|Kurfürstliches Schloss]]'', built as a residence for the prince-elector and now the main building of the [[University of Bonn]]. 
[[File:Bonner Münster.jpg|thumb|Erected in the 11th and 13th century, the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[Bonn Minster|Minster of Bonn]] is one of Germany's oldest churches.]]
The ''Poppelsdorfer Allee'' is an avenue flanked by [[Chestnut]] trees which had the first [[horsecar]] of the city. It connects the ''Kurfürstliches Schloss'' with the ''[[Poppelsdorfer Schloss]]'', a palace that was built as a resort for the prince-electors in the first half of the 18th century, and whose grounds are now a [[botanical garden]] (the [[Botanischer Garten Bonn]]). This axis is interrupted by a railway line and [[Bonn Hauptbahnhof]], a building erected in 1883/84.

The [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] stands on the Münsterplatz, which is flanked by the [[Bonn Minster]], one of Germany's oldest churches.

The three highest structures in the city are the [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] [[Radio masts and towers|radio mast]] in Bonn-Venusberg ({{convert|180|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the headquarters of the [[Deutsche Post]] called ''[[Post Tower]]'' ({{convert|162.5|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) and the former building for the German members of parliament ''[[Langer Eugen]]'' ({{convert|114.7|m|ft|disp=or|abbr=on}}) now the location of the UN Campus.

Just as Bonn's other four major museums, the ''[[Haus der Geschichte]]'' or Museum of the History of the Federal Republic of Germany, is located on the so-called ''Museumsmeile'' ("Museum Mile")''.'' The Haus der Geschichte is one of the foremost German museums of contemporary German history, with branches in [[Berlin]] and [[Leipzig]]. In its permanent exhibition, the Haus der Geschichte presents German history from 1945 until the present, also shedding light on Bonn's own role as former capital of West Germany. Numerous temporary exhibitions emphasize different features, such as Nazism or important personalities in German history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hdg.de/index.php?id=1&L=1|title=Stiftung Haus der Geschichte der Bundesrepublik Deutschland: Home|date=13 June 2008|publisher=Hdg.de|access-date=5 May 2009}}</ref>

The ''[[Kunstmuseum Bonn]]'' or Bonn Museum of Modern Art is an art museum founded in 1947. The Kunstmuseum exhibits both temporary exhibitions and its permanent collection.

There are several parks, leisure and protected areas in and around Bonn. The ''{{ill|Rheinaue|de}}'' is Bonn's most important leisure park, with its role being comparable to what [[Central Park]] is for New York City. It lies on the banks of the Rhine and is the city's biggest park intra muros. The Rhine promenade and the ''Alter Zoll'' (Old Toll Station) are in direct neighbourhood of the city centre and are popular amongst both residents and visitors. The ''[[Arboretum Park Härle]]'' is an [[arboretum]] with specimens dating to back to 1870. The ''[[Botanical Garden, Bonn|Botanischer Garten]]'' (Botanical Garden) is affiliated with the university. The natural reserve of ''[[Kottenforst]]'' is a large area of protected woods on the hills west of the city centre. It is about {{convert|40|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}} in area and part of the [[Rhineland Nature Park]] ({{convert|1045|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

In the very south of the city, on the border with [[Wachtberg]] and [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], there is an extinct volcano, the [[Rodderberg]], featuring a popular area for hikes. Also south of the city, there is the [[Siebengebirge]] which is part of the lower half of the [[Middle Rhine]] region. The nearby upper half of the [[Middle Rhine]] from [[Bingen am Rhein|Bingen]] to [[Koblenz]] is a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Europe|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] with more than 40 castles and fortresses from the [[Middle Ages]] and important German vineyards.

It can be reached by Stadtbahn line 66 (approx. 25 minutes from central Bonn).

Bonn has a [[Stadtbahn]] light rail and a tram system. The [[Bonn Stadtbahn]] has 4 regular lines that connect the main north–south axis (centre to [[Bad Godesberg]]) and quarters east of the Rhine ([[Beuel]] and [[Oberkassel, Bonn|Oberkassel]]), as well as many nearby towns like [[Brühl (Rhineland)|Brühl]], [[Wesseling]], [[Sankt Augustin]], [[Siegburg]], [[Königswinter]], and [[Bad Honnef]]. All lines serve the Central Station and two lines continue to Cologne, where they connect to the [[Cologne Stadtbahn]]. The [[Trams in Bonn|Bonn tram]] system consists of two lines that connect closer quarters in the south, north and east of Bonn to the Central Station. While the Stadtbahn mostly has its own right-of-way, the tram often operates on general road lanes. A few sections of track are used by both systems. These urban rail lines are supplemented by a bus system of roughly 30 regular lines, especially since some parts of the city like [[Hardtberg]] and most of [[Bad Godesberg]] completely lack a Stadtbahn/Tram connection. Several lines offer night services, especially during the weekends. Bonn is part of the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Sieg]] (''Rhine-Sieg Transport Association'') which is the public transport association covering the area of the [[Cologne/Bonn Region]].

=== Road network ===
[[File:Region Bonn motorways.png|left|thumb|upright=0.6|Road network adjacent to Bonn]]
Four [[Autobahn]]s run through or are adjacent to Bonn: the [[Bundesautobahn 59|A59]] (right bank of the Rhine, connecting Bonn with [[Düsseldorf]] and [[Duisburg]]), the [[Bundesautobahn 555|A555]] (left bank of the [[Rhine]], connecting Bonn with Cologne), the [[Bundesautobahn 562|A562]] (connecting the right with the left bank of the Rhine south of Bonn), and the [[Bundesautobahn 565|A565]] (connecting the A59 and the A555 with the [[Bundesautobahn 61|A61]] to the southwest). Three Bundesstraßen, which have a general {{convert|100|km/h|abbr=off}} [[speed limit]] in contrast to the Autobahn, connect Bonn to its immediate surroundings (Bundesstraßen B9, B42 and B56).

With Bonn being divided into two parts by the [[Rhine]], three bridges are crucial for inner-city road traffic: the Konrad-Adenauer-Brücke (A562) in the South, the Friedrich-Ebert-Brücke (A565) in the North, and the Kennedybrücke (B56) in the centre. In addition, regular ferries operate between Bonn-Mehlem and [[Königswinter]], Bonn-[[Bad Godesberg]] and Königswinter-[[Niederdollendorf]], and Bonn-Graurheindorf and [[Niederkassel]]-Mondorf.

=== Port ===
Located in the northern sub-district of Graurheindorf, the [[Inland harbor|inland harbour]] of Bonn is used for container traffic as well as oversea transport. The annual turnover amounts to around {{convert|500000|t||abbr=on}}. Regular passenger transport occurs to Cologne and Düsseldorf.

Retrieved 8 March 2014. {{in lang|de}}</ref> The club is the reigning champion of the [[2022–23 Basketball Champions League]].

The city also has a semi-professional football team [[Bonner SC]] which was formed in 1965 through the merger of ''Bonner FV'' and ''Tura Bonn''.

The Bonn Gamecocks American football team play at the 12,000-capacity Stadion Pennenfeld.

The successful [[Baseball in Germany|German Baseball]] team [[Bonn Capitals]] are also found in the city of Bonn.

The headquarters of the [[International Paralympic Committee]] has been located in Bonn since 1999.

==International relations==
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Germany}}
Since 1983, the City of Bonn has established friendship relations with the City of [[Tel Aviv]], Israel, and since 1988 Bonn, in former times the residence of the Princes Electors of Cologne, and [[Potsdam]], Germany, the formerly most important residential city of the Prussian rulers, have established a city-to-city partnership.

Central Bonn is surrounded by a number of traditional towns and villages which were independent up to several decades ago. As many of those communities had already established their own contacts and partnerships before the regional and local reorganisation in 1969, the Federal City of Bonn now has a dense network of city district partnerships with European partner towns.

The city district of Bonn is a partner of the English university city of [[Oxford]], England, UK (since 1947), of [[Budafok]], District XXII of [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] (since 1991) and of [[Opole]], [[Poland]] (officially since 1997; contacts were established 1954).

The district of Bad Godesberg has established partnerships with [[Saint-Cloud]] in France, [[Frascati]] in Italy, [[Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead|Windsor and Maidenhead]] in England, UK and [[Kortrijk]] in Belgium; a friendship agreement has been signed with the town of [[Yalova]], Turkey.

The district of Beuel on the right bank of the Rhine and the city district of Hardtberg foster partnerships with towns in France: [[Mirecourt]] and [[Villemomble]].

Moreover, the city of Bonn has developed a concept of international co-operation and maintains sustainability oriented project partnerships in addition to traditional city twinning, among others with [[Minsk]] in Belarus, [[Ulaanbaatar]] in Mongolia, [[Bukhara]] in Uzbekistan, [[Chengdu]] in China and [[La Paz]] in Bolivia.
