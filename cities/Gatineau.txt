Gatineau is coextensive with a [[territory equivalent to a regional county municipality]] (TE) and [[Census geographic units of Canada|census division]] (CD) of the same name, whose geographical code is 81.

==Toponomy==
In 1613, during his first passage on the [[Ottawa River]], the great explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] was the first European to speak of "the river that comes from the north", traveled for millennia by Aboriginals, but he did not name it. In 1721, Canadian surveyor [[Noël Beaupré]] recorded the river, but did not give it a name. In short, the name Gatineau was not used in [[New France]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=L'origine incertaine du toponyme Gatineau - French |url=https://infodelavallee.ca/culture/2021/04/16/lorigine-incertaine-du-toponyme-gatineau/ |access-date=17 November 2023 |website=L'info de la vallee}}</ref>

In fact, it was not until 1783 that the river was mentioned as Lettinoe in a report by Lieutenant David Jones to the Governor of Quebec, [[Frederick Haldimand|Sir Frederic Haldimand]]. In 1817, a map by [[Theodore Davis (Canadian politician)|Theodore Davis]] shows Gatteno, a name taken up with Gatino, Gateno and Gattino on plans by [[Philemon Wright]], the founder of [[Hull, Quebec|Hull Township]], and by Lieutenant-Colonel [[John By]], the engineer responsible for building the [[Rideau Canal]].

It was not until 1821 that the name Gatineau first appeared on a map of Nepean Township, Ontario. The same name appears again on [[William Henderson (architect)|William Henderson]]'s map of 1831, and on another drawn thirty years later by surveyor Thomas Devine. Thereafter, the river was always referred to as the [[Gatineau River|Gatineau]].<ref name=":0" />

There are two hypotheses to explain the origin of the city's name. It would be either of Indigenous origin or of French origin:
# The name of the river and the city would come from the Anishinaabemowin (language of the Algonquin Anishinaabeg) Tenagatino Zibi, according to the elders of Kitigan Zibi.<ref>Rick Henderson, https://www.capitalchronicles.ca/post/gatineau-paddling-through-the-history-of-a-river-s-name {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327191420/https://www.capitalchronicles.ca/post/gatineau-paddling-through-the-history-of-a-river-s-name |date=27 March 2023 }} www.capitalchronicles.ca, 13 novembre 2021</ref>
# In his 1889 article published in the Echo de la Gatineau,<ref>Benjamin Sulte, « Gatineau », L'Écho de la Gatineau, 6 juillet 1889, http://data2.collectionscanada.ca/001094/pdf/18890706-echo-de-la-gatineau-pointegatineau.pdf, pg. 1 and 2</ref> Benjamin Sulte wrote: "One hundred years ago, the Gatineau family was extinct, or thereabouts; it is hardly likely that we waited for its disappearance to consecrate the memory of the three or four fur traders it produced. The custom must have been established during the lifetime of these men, and because they traded in these places. Of the latter fact, for instance, I am not certain." In his own words, Sulte writes that he is creating a myth and that the story that the Gatineau family gave the river its name is a myth, invented by Sulte himself. According to Sulte, the name Gatineau comes from the Gastineau family - not Gatineau - one of its members, Nicolas Gastineau sieur Duplessis (1627-1689).<ref>Rick Henderson, https://www.capitalchronicles.ca/post/gatineau-paddling-through-the-history-of-a-river-s-name {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327191420/https://www.capitalchronicles.ca/post/gatineau-paddling-through-the-history-of-a-river-s-name |date=27 March 2023 }}, 31 novembre 2021</ref><ref>Commission de toponymie du Québec — ville de Gatineau [archive], https://toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=24715 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230828222639/https://toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=24715 |date=28 August 2023 }}</ref>

Prior to European settlement, the Gatineau area was inhabited by the [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] people which is part of the larger [[Algonquin people|Anishinaabe]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gatineau |url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/gatineau |access-date=2024-03-30 |website=www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca |language=en}}</ref> The current city of Gatineau is centred on an area formerly called [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]]. It is the oldest European colonial settlement in the [[National Capital Region (Canada)|National Capital Region]], but this area was essentially not developed by Europeans until after the [[American Revolutionary War]], when [[the Crown]] granted land through the ''Leaders and Associates'' <ref>{{cite web | url=https://jchmhistorian.com/2020/11/18/leaders-and-associates-the-unique-land-grant-system-of-early-lower-canada/ | title=Leaders and Associates – the unique land grant system of early Lower Canada | date=19 November 2020 | access-date=27 March 2023 | archive-date=27 March 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327191011/https://jchmhistorian.com/2020/11/18/leaders-and-associates-the-unique-land-grant-system-of-early-lower-canada/ | url-status=live }}</ref> program of the Lower Canada Executive, which brought settlement in the [[Ottawa Valley]].<ref>http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/wright_philemon_7E.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230327191011/http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/wright_philemon_7E.html |date=27 March 2023 }}, 3rd & 4th paragraphs</ref>

Hull was founded on the north shore of the [[Ottawa River]] in 1800 by [[Philemon Wright]] at the [[portage]] around the [[Chaudière Falls]], just upstream (or west) from the confluence of the [[Gatineau River|Gatineau]] and [[Rideau River|Rideau]] rivers with the Ottawa River. Wright brought his family, four other families, and twenty-five (or 33, according to Philemon's own conflicting reports) labourers<ref>John H. Taylor, ''Ottawa: An Illustrated History'', James Lorimer & Company, Publishers, Toronto, 1986, p.11</ref> with the hope of establishing an agricultural community, but by 1806, Wright and his family took advantage of the large [[forest stands]] and began the [[Ottawa River timber trade]], floating the first square timber raft down the Ottawa River to Québec City. For a while, the industry was under a monopoly known as the [[Gatineau Privilege]]. The original settlement was called [[Wright's Town, Lower Canada]], and was later renamed as Hull, when it was incorporated in 1875. [[Bytown]], founded in 1832, stood across the river from Wright's Town. In 2002, after amalgamation, Hull became part of a larger jurisdiction named the City of Gatineau.

In 1820, before [[Irish Canadians|immigrants from Ireland]] and Great Britain arrived in great numbers, [[Hull, Quebec|Hull Township]] had a population of 707, including 365 men, 113 women, and 229 children. The high number of men were related to workers in the lumber trade. In 1824, there were 106 families and 803 persons. During the rest of the 1820s, the population of Hull doubled, with the arrival of Protestant immigrants from [[Ulster]], now Northern Ireland. By 1851, the population of the County of Ottawa was 11,104, of which 2,811 lived in Hull. By comparison, Bytown had a population of 7,760 in 1851. By 1861, Ottawa County had a population of 15,671, of which 3,711 lived in Hull.

Gradually [[French Canadians]] also migrated to the township; their proportion of the population increased from 10% in 1850, to 50% in 1870, and 90% in 1920.<ref>Martin, Michael, ''[http://web.ncf.ca/fn871/Media/Docs/Book1/Book1_WorkingClassCulture.pdf Working Class Culture and the Development of Hull QC] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611145357/http://web.ncf.ca/fn871/Media/Docs/Book1/Book1_WorkingClassCulture.pdf |date=11 June 2011 }}'' p.&nbsp;48, 2006.</ref> Industrial development in the mid-nineteenth century attracted large numbers of French-Canadian workers to Hull.

The Gatineau River, like the Ottawa River, was a basic transportation resource for the ''draveurs'', [[Timber rafting|timber rafters]] who transported logs via the rivers from lumber camps to downriver destinations. (The [[Gatineau River]] flows south into the [[Ottawa River]], which flows east to the [[St. Lawrence River]] near [[Montreal]].) The log-filled Ottawa River, as viewed from Hull, was featured on the back of the [[Canadian one-dollar bill]]; the paper money was replaced by a dollar coin (the "[[loonie]]") in 1987. The last of the dwindling activity of the draveurs on these rivers ended a few years later.

Very little remains of the original 1800 settlement of Hull because the oldest sectors of the town were destroyed by several fires, especially the [[1900 Hull–Ottawa fire|destructive fire in 1900]]. The fire also seriously damaged the ''pont des Chaudières'' (''[[Chaudière Bridge]]''), but the bridge was rebuilt to join Ottawa to Hull at [[Victoria Island (Ottawa River)|Victoria Island]].

In the 1940s, during World War II, Hull, along with various other regions within Canada, such as [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean]], and [[Île Sainte-Hélène]], was the site of [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s.<ref name="Tremblay">Tremblay, Robert, Bibliothèque et Archives Canada, et al.

During the 1970s and early 1980s, the decaying old downtown core of Hull was redeveloped. Old buildings were demolished and replaced by a series of large office complexes. In addition some 4,000 residents were displaced, and many businesses uprooted along what was once the town's main commercial area.<ref>Harold Kalman and John Roaf, ''Exploring Ottawa: An Architectural Guide to the Nation's Capital.''

== Geography ==
Gatineau is located in southwestern [[Quebec]], on the northern bank of the [[Gatineau River]]. It is situated at an elevation of around 50&nbsp;m (164.042&nbsp;ft)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Carte topographique Gatineau, altitude, relief |url=https://fr-ca.topographic-map.com/map-3mj18/Gatineau/?center=45.44929,-75.71949&zoom=12&popup=45.46422,-75.70318 |access-date=17 November 2023 |website=Cartes topographiques |language=fr}}</ref> The [[Gatineau Hills]] are the foothills of the [[Laurentian Mountains]] and located in the region. It is also the location of [[List of urban parks by size|the second largest urban park in the world]]. They supply great [[Alpine skiing|skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] opportunities within minutes of the city. Gatineau is situated close to where the [[Canadian shield]] and the [[Saint Lawrence Lowlands]] intersect. The area has several major fault lines<ref>{{cite web |date=14 April 2009 |title=Urban Geology of the National Capital Area – Bedrock topography |url=http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/urbgeo/natcap/bed_topo_e.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518182649/http://gsc.nrcan.gc.ca/urbgeo/natcap/bed_topo_e.php |archive-date=18 May 2011 |access-date=20 August 2010 |publisher=Gsc.nrcan.gc.ca }}</ref> and small earthquakes do occur somewhat regularly, on average, there are at least one earthquake of intensity III or higher once every three years in [[Ottawa-Gatineau]].

=== Hydrography ===
Gatineau's entire territory is drained by the [[Ottawa River]], the main tributary of the [[St. Lawrence River|St. Lawrence]]. The river marks the city's southern boundary. To the southwest, it widens to form [[Lac Deschênes]]. The city is also crossed by several rivers: the [[Gatineau River|Gatineau]], the [[Lièvre River|Lièvre]] and the Blanche. The territory is also criss-crossed by a dozen streams, including the [[ruisseau de la Brasserie]], which forms an island in the downtown area.

There are several lakes in Gatineau, the most notable of which are [[Lac Leamy]], [[Lac Beauchamp]], [[Lac des Fées]], Lac de la Carrière and [[Pink Lake (Canada)|Lac Pink]]. Pink is one of the few [[meromictic lake]]s in North America.

{{Main|National Capital Region (Canada)}}
'''Gatineau''' is one of the two major parts of the National Capital Region ({{lang|fr|Région de la capitale nationale}}), also known as Canada's Capital Region and Ottawa–Gatineau, which is an official federal designation encompassing the [[Canada|Canadian]] capital of [[Ottawa]], Ontario, the adjacent city of Gatineau, Quebec, and surrounding suburban and [[Exurb|exurban areas]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/N-4/FullText.html |title= National Capital Act (Consolidated federal laws of Canada) |publisher=Justice Canada |date=September 30, 2013 |access-date=March 15, 2024}}</ref> Which include larger urban communities such as [[Clarence-Rockland]], [[Russell, Ontario|Russell]], [[North Grenville]], [[Val-des-Monts, Quebec|Val-des-Monts]] and [[Cantley, Quebec|Cantley]]. It also includes smaller villages such as [[Bowman, Quebec|Bowman]], [[Denholm, Quebec|Denholm]], [[Lochaber, Quebec|Lochaber]] and [[Val-des-Bois, Quebec|Val-des-Bois]].

The [[National Capital Region (Canada)#Attractions|National Capital Region]] has numerous attractions, including world-famous festivals, national museums, famous buildings and architecture, sports, and entertainment. Gatineau is home to the [[Canadian Museum of History]], one of Canada's most visited museums, designed by the renowned architect [[Douglas Cardinal]], a leading figure in contemporary Indigenous architecture.

==== Amalgamation ====
As part of the [[2000–06 municipal reorganization in Quebec]], the five municipalities that constituted the ''Communauté urbaine de l'Outaouais'' (''Outaouais urban community'') were merged on 1 January 2002 to constitute the new city of Gatineau. They were:
*[[Aylmer, Quebec|Aylmer]]
*[[Buckingham, Quebec|Buckingham]]
*[[Hull, Quebec|Hull]]
*Gatineau
*[[Masson-Angers]]

Although Hull was the oldest and most central of the merged cities, the name Gatineau was chosen for the new city. The historic municipality of Gatineau had more residents than Hull, and this name was strongly associated with the area: it was the name of the former county, valley, hills, and park and the main river within the new city limits.

After the 2003 election, the new [[Quebec Liberal Party|Liberal]] government of [[Jean Charest]] passed Bill 9, which created a process by which former municipalities could be reconstituted. Contrary to Charest's election promise of full de-amalgamation, Bill 9 restored only selected powers to the de-merged cities (e.g., animal control, garbage pickup, local street maintenance, some cultural facilities). The bigger expenses (e.g., police, fire, main streets, expansion programs) and the majority of the taxes remained in the hands of urban agglomerations. These are controlled by the central merged city because their larger populations give them greater voting weight. 10% of the eligible voters in each former municipality would have to sign a "register" in order to hold a referendum on de-amalgamation.

Residents of Aylmer, Buckingham, Hull and Masson-Angers all surpassed this threshold and sought referendums on de-merge. A simple majority of "yes" votes, based on a turnout of at least 35% of voters, is needed to de-merge. All of the above jurisdictions had the required turnout. A majority of voters in each jurisdiction rejected the de-merger.<ref name="DGE">{{cite web |title=Referendums of June 20, 2004 |url=http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/english/tables/result-referendum-2004.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304060629/http://www.electionsquebec.qc.ca/english/tables/result-referendum-2004.php |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=19 February 2017 |publisher=Directeur-Général des Élections}}</ref>{{bar box

The cultural diversity of the city of Gatineau is noteworthy. The city welcomes between 800 and 1,000 newcomers to Canada each year. They come from some sixty countries and enrich the Gatineau identity.<ref name="George"/>

Canadians were able to self-identify one or more ethnocultural ancestries in the [[Canada 2001 Census|2001 census]]. (Percentages may therefore add up to more than 100%.) The most common response was [[Canadian ethnicity|Canadian/''Canadien'']] and since the term 'Canadian' is as much an expression of citizenship as of ethnicity these figures should not be considered an exact record of the relative prevalence of different ethnocultural ancestries. 43.1% of respondents gave a single response of Canadian/''Canadien'' while a further 26.5% identified both Canadian/''Canadien'' and one or more other ethnocultural ancestries. 10.4% of respondents gave a single response of [[French people|French]], 1.1% gave a single response of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], 1.0% gave a single response of Irish, 0.9% gave a single response of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], 0.8% gave a single response of English, 0.7% gave a single responses of ''[[French-speaking Quebecer|Québécois]]'' and 0.7% gave a single response of [[North American Indian]]. According to [[Statistics Canada]], counting both single and multiple responses, the most commonly identified ethnocultural ancestries were: 70.7% North American, 37.8% French, 14.3% British Isles, 4.5% Aboriginal, 4.0% Southern European, 3.8% Western European, 1.9% Arab, 1.7% Eastern European, 1.0% East and Southeast Asian, 0.8% African, 0.7% Latin, Central and South American, 0.7% Caribbean and 0.5% Northern European.

==Economy==
Originally, Gatineau's economy was based almost entirely on pulp and paper. However, a number of federal and provincial government offices are located in Gatineau, due to its proximity to the national capital, and its status as the main town of the [[Outaouais]] region of Quebec.

A policy of the federal government to distribute federal jobs on both sides of the [[Ottawa River]] led to the construction of several massive office towers to house federal civil servants in downtown Gatineau;<ref>{{cite web |title=Renovation, repair and maintenance work at Place du Portage complex |url=https://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/trans/pq-qp/qp22-eng.html#Background |publisher=Public Services and Procurement Canada |date=October 5, 2023 |access-date=18 March 2024}}</ref> the largest of these are [[Place du Portage]] and [[Terrasses de la Chaudière]], occupying part of the downtown core of the city. Some government agencies and ministries headquartered in Gatineau are the [[Public Works and Government Services Canada]], [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]], [[Environment Canada]], [[Transportation Safety Board of Canada]].<ref>"[http://www.tsb.gc.ca/eng/contactez-contact/index.asp Contact Us]." Transportation Safety Board of Canada. Retrieved 31 May 2009.</ref>

The following federal government departments have their main offices in Gatineau:

* [[Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development Canada]]
* [[Canadian Heritage]]
* [[Employment and Social Development Canada]]
* [[Environment Canada]] (includes offices of [[Parks Canada]])
* [[Public Works and Government Services Canada]]

The following agencies have their main offices in Gatineau.

* [[Transportation Safety Board of Canada]]
* [[Passport Canada]] (under [[Citizenship and Immigration Canada]])
* [[Competition Bureau]], the [[Canadian Patent Office]] and the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (under [[Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada]])

In addition to housing a significant portion of federal government offices, the city is also an important regional centre for the Outaouais region. The city serves as the location for the Superior Court of the District of Gatineau, which encompasses all neighboring municipalities. It also houses two of the region's major hospitals as well as numerous provincial colleges.

Other important economic sectors are health care, tourism, education, small business and the provincial public service. The health care and education sectors are particularly important because they represent the region's largest sources of permanent employment outside the federal government. The provincial public service also has a strong presence in the city, due to its status as the region's principal city. There are two hospitals in the city, one in the Hull sector and the other in the Gatineau sector, as well as numerous other clinics and health centers. There are also numerous primary and secondary schools scattered throughout the city. They are managed by four school boards, three of which are French-speaking and one English-speaking. The city is also a major tourist region, with over a million tourists a year visiting the city's museums, parks, lakes and other outdoor attractions.

The Gatineau-Ottawa metropolitan region has over 1,900 technology companies, employing close to 80,000 workers. There are also over 65 research centers and six universities with over 160,000 students (20% of whom are enrolled in science, engineering, and technology programs).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Why Gatineau? |url=https://pourquoigatineau.com/en/become-part-of-the-national-capital-region-ecosystem/ |access-date=17 November 2023 |website=Why Gatineau? |language=en-CA}}</ref>

Gatineau's economy relies on a few important sectors. A majority of jobs are accounted for between the federal government, construction and service industries. There is however a large effort to modernize the economy in the region through recent initiatives in the entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystem. The [[Innovation Gatineau Institute]] is a regional innovation centre that boasts co-working space as well as startup incubation and acceleration programs to spur innovative business creation. In 2020,  The Honourable [[Mélanie Joly]], Minister of Economic Development and Official Languages, visited [[Outaouais|the Outaouais region]] to announce  a total of $1,553,448 in financial assistance. This funding will help expand the entrepreneurial ecosystem.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Regions |first=Canada Economic Development for Quebec |date=27 August 2020 |title=Gatineau: a key player in Quebec's economy |url=https://www.canada.ca/en/economic-development-quebec-regions/news/2020/08/gatineau-a-key-player-in-quebecs-economy.html |access-date=17 November 2023 |website=canada.ca}}</ref>

=== Music ===
As Gatineau is the smaller of the two cities in its CMA, most major artists perform in Ottawa. However, since the construction of the Centre Slush Puppy, there has been a demand for more events. The first of which was [[Flo Rida]], who almost sold out the 5,000 capacity arena, with around 3,000 tickets sold.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Un premier spectacle réussi au Centre Slush Puppie |url=https://tvagatineau.ca/un-premier-spectacle-reussi-au-centre-slush-puppie/ |access-date=2024-03-30 |website=TVA Gatineau |language=fr-CA}}</ref>

=== Parks ===
There are many parks. Some of them are well gardened playgrounds or resting spaces while others, like [[Lac Beauchamp Park]], are relatively wild green areas which often merge with the woods and fields of the surrounding municipalities. Streams of all sizes run through these natural expanses. Most of the city is on level ground but the Northern and Eastern parts lie on the beginnings of the foothills of the massive [[Canadian Shield]], or [[Laurentian Mountains]]. These are the "[[Gatineau Hills]]", and are visible in the background of the companion picture.

The [[Gatineau-Ottawa Executive Airport]] is Gatineau's municipal airport, capable of handling small jets. There are Canada customs facilities for aircraft coming from outside Canada, a car rental counter and a restaurant. The airport has a few regularly scheduled flights to points within Quebec, but most residents of Gatineau use the nearby [[Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport]] or travel to [[Montréal–Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]] in Montreal.

Ottawa and Gatineau have two distinct bus-based public transit systems with different fare structures, [[OC Transpo]] and the [[Société de transport de l'Outaouais]]. Tickets are not interchangeable between the two, however passes and transfers from one system to the other do not require payment of a surcharge on any routes. There is a [[Gatineau LRT|proposed LRT system]] that would connect Gatineau to [[Bayview station (Ottawa)|Bayview]] and [[Rideau Centre]] Stations in Ottawa.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gatineau reveals $2.1B LRT plan, eyes 2028 launch |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/gatineau-aylmer-ottawa-light-rail-1.4713843 |access-date=20 December 2018 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |date=20 June 2018 |archive-date=14 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181114184041/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/ottawa/gatineau-aylmer-ottawa-light-rail-1.4713843 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Roads ===

Many Gatineau highways and major arteries feed directly into the bridges crossing over to Ottawa, but once there the roads lead into the dense downtown grid or into residential areas, with no direct connection to [[Ontario Highway 417|The Queensway]]. This difficulty is further magnified by the lack of a major highway on the Quebec side of the [[Ottawa River]] connecting Gatineau to Montreal, the [[metropolis]] of the province; most travellers from Gatineau to Montreal first cross over to Ottawa, and use Ontario highways to access Montreal. However, it is expected that since [[Quebec Autoroute 50|Autoroute 50]] has been completed,<ref>[http://thereview.ca/story/crews-will-work-through-winter-have-highway-50-open-2012 Crews will work through winter to have Highway 50 open in 2012 | The Review] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010091817/http://thereview.ca/story/crews-will-work-through-winter-have-highway-50-open-2012 |date=10 October 2011 }}.

Retrieved 12 July 2013.</ref> the new link between Gatineau and the [[Laurentides]] popular tourist area may serve as part of a Montreal by-pass by the north shore for Outaouais residents.

==Education==
The [[Education in Quebec|education system in Quebec]] is different from other systems in Canada. It consists of 6 years of primary schooling and 5 years of secondary schooling, after which students must attend an additional school called [[CEGEP]], or ''Collège d'enseignement général et professionnel'' if they want to access the province’s universities. CEGEPs offer both pre-university (2-years) and technical (3-years) programs.

With 28.3% of its population over 20 years of age having completed university studies, Gatineau is well ahead of the rest of the Canada. Gatineau also has one of the highest bilingualism rates, with 63.5% of its population fluent in both English and French.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Why Gatineau? |url=https://pourquoigatineau.com/en/a-highly-educated-and-bilingual-labour-force/ |access-date=17 November 2023 |website=Why Gatineau? |language=en-CA}}</ref>

The city of Gatineau, within its Hull neighborhood, houses the main campus of the [[Université du Québec en Outaouais]] (UQO), part of the [[Université du Québec]] network. The UQO counts over 5,500 students, mostly within its multiple social science programs. It is world-renowned{{weasel inline|date=June 2021}} for its cyber-psychology laboratory. Faced with a limited number of domains of study, many Quebec students attend other universities, either in [[Ottawa]] or [[Montreal]]. Every year, the UQO hosts the [[Bar of Quebec]] course for certification of new lawyers.

Gatineau is also the home of two CEGEPs, including the [[French language|francophone]] [[Cégep de l'Outaouais]] with three campuses across the city and the [[English language|anglophone]] [[Heritage College (Gatineau)|Heritage College]].

The main French-language school boards in Gatineau are the [[Centre de services scolaire des Portages-de-l'Outaouais|Commission scolaire des Portages-de-l'Outaouais]], the [[Centre de services scolaire au Cœur-des-Vallées|Commission scolaire au Coeur-des-Vallées]], and the [[Centre de services scolaire des Draveurs|Commission scolaire des Draveurs]]. There are also four private high schools: the all-girl Collège Saint-Joseph, the [[Collège Saint-Alexandre]], and École secondaire [[Collège Nouvelles-Frontières|Nouvelles-Frontières]] and le Centre académique de l'Outaouais (CADO). Elementary and secondary education in English is held under the supervision of the [[Western Quebec School Board]].

Since 1995, the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM) has a campus in Gatineau.<ref>{{cite web |title=The UNAM in the United States - Permanent Extension School (Escuela Permanente de Extensión-EPE-), San Antonio, Texas |url=http://www.100.unam.mx/index.php?option=com_content&id=144&Itemid=81&lang=en |website=100.unam.mx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140822103553/http://www.100.unam.mx/index.php?option=com_content&id=144&Itemid=81&lang=en |archive-date=22 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=UNAM-Canada, Gatineau, Quebec |url=https://canada.unam.mx/en/history/ |website=Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México |access-date=27 April 2020 |archive-date=28 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230828223724/https://canada.unam.mx/en/history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> A military training centre, [[Defence Public Affairs Learning Centre]], is also located in Gatineau.

==Media==
{{main|Media in Ottawa–Gatineau}}

Gatineau is the [[city of licence]] for several television and radio stations serving the National Capital Region, which is a single media market. Many of the Ottawa-Gatineau region's TV and FM broadcast stations transmit from [[Gatineau Park|Camp Fortune]] just north of Gatineau. All of the stations licensed directly to Gatineau broadcast in French.

Weekly newspapers published in Gatineau include ''Le Bulletin d'Aylmer'' (bilingual) and ''The West Quebec Post''. Although Gatineau does not have its own daily newspaper, it is served by daily newspapers published in Ottawa, including the French ''[[Le Droit]]'' and the English ''[[Ottawa Citizen]]'' and ''[[Ottawa Sun]]''.

The [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]], the Canadian regulatory agency for broadcasting, is based in Gatineau at [[Terrasses de la Chaudière]].
