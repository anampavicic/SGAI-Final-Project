Tbilisi was founded in the fifth century [[Anno Domini|AD]] by [[Vakhtang I of Iberia]], and since then has served as the capital of various Georgian kingdoms and republics. Between 1801 and 1917, then part of the [[Russian Empire]], Tiflis was the seat of the [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Caucasus Viceroyalty]], governing both the [[North Caucasus|northern]] and the [[Transcaucasia|southern]] parts of the [[Caucasus]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-01-24 |title=Tbilisi: The Immortal City |url=https://geohistory.today/tbilisi/ |access-date=2023-07-14 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Tbilisi |url=https://tbilisi.gov.ge/pages/history?lang=en |access-date=2023-07-14 |website=tbilisi.gov.ge}}</ref>

Because of its location at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, and its proximity to the lucrative [[Silk Road]], throughout history, Tbilisi has been a point of contention among various global powers. To this day, the city's location ensures its position as an important transit route for energy and trade projects. Tbilisi's history is reflected in its architecture, which is a mix of [[medieval architecture|medieval]], [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Stalinist architecture|Stalinist]], and [[Modern architecture|Modern]] structures.

Historically, Tbilisi has been home to people of multiple cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, though its population is overwhelmingly [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]]. Notable tourist destinations include cathedrals [[Holy Trinity Cathedral of Tbilisi|Sameba]] and [[Tbilisi Sioni Cathedral|Sioni]], [[Freedom Square, Tbilisi|Freedom Square]], [[Rustaveli Avenue]] and [[David Agmashenebeli Avenue|Agmashenebeli Avenue]], medieval [[Narikala|Narikala Fortress]], the [[Moorish Revival architecture#Moorish Revival in Europe|pseudo-Moorish]] [[Georgian National Opera Theater|Opera Theater]], and the [[Georgian National Museum]]. The climate in Tbilisi mostly ranges from {{convert|20|to|32|°C }} in summer and {{convert|-1|to|7|°C}} in winter.

=={{anchor|Names and etymology}}Names and etymology==
{{see also|Names of Tbilisi in different languages}}
The name "Tbilisi" derives from [[Old Georgian]] {{lang|oge-Latn|Tbilisi}} ([[Asomtavruli]]: {{wikt-lang|oge|თბილისი|ႧႡႨႪႨႱႨ}}, [[Mkhedruli]]: {{wikt-lang|ka|თბილისი}}), and further from {{lang|ka-Latn|tpili}} ([[Georgian language|Modern Georgian]]: {{wikt-lang|ka|თბილი}}, warm, itself from Old Georgian: {{wikt-lang|oge|ტფილი|ႲႴႨႪႨ}} {{lang|oge-Latn|ṭpili}}). The name {{lang|ka-Latn|Tbilisi}} (the place of warmth) was therefore given to the city because of the area's numerous [[sulfur]]ic [[hot spring]]s.

Until 1936, the name of the city in English and most other languages followed the [[Persian language|Persian]] pronunciation<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Everett-Heath |first1=John |article=Tbilisi (Tbilisi), Georgia (Tiflis) |title=The Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names |date=2020 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0191905636 |edition=6 |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780191905636.001.0001/acref-9780191905636-e-7298?rskey=gklvb2&result=2 |quote=The former name is the Persian pronunciation, which is also used by Russians and Armenians.

On 17 August 1936, by order of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] leadership, the official Russian names of various cities were changed to more closely match the local language.<ref name="Tiflis"/> In addition, the Georgian-language form {{lang|ka-Latn|Ṭpilisi}} was modernized on the basis of a proposal by Georgian linguists; the ancient Georgian component {{lang|ka|ტფილი}} ({{lang|ka-Latn|ṭpili}}, 'warm') was replaced by the newer {{lang|ka|თბილი}} ({{lang|ka-Latn|tbili}}).<ref name="Tiflis"/> That form was the basis for the new official Russian name ({{lang|ru|Тбилиси}} {{lang|ru-Latn|Tbilisi}}).  Most other languages have subsequently adopted the new name form, but some languages, such as Turkish, Persian, [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]], have retained a variation of {{lang|tr|Tiflis}}.

On 20 September 2006, the Georgian parliament held a ceremony celebrating the 70th anniversary of the renaming.

Some of the traditional names of Tbilisi in other languages of the region have different roots. The [[Ossetian language|Ossetian]] name {{lang|os|Калак}} ({{lang|os-Latn|Kalak}}) derives from the Georgian word {{lang|ka|ქალაქი}} ({{lang|ka-Latn|kalaki}}) meaning simply city. [[Chechen language|Chechen]] and [[Ingush language|Ingush]] names for the city use a form similar to or the same as their names for the country of Georgia ({{lang|chc|Гуьржех}} {{lang|chc-Latn|Gürƶex}}) as does the historical [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] name ({{lang|kbd|Курджы}} {{lang|kbd-Latn|Kwrdžə}}), while [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] {{lang|ab|Қарҭ}} ({{lang|ab-Latn|Ķarţ}}) is from the [[Mingrelian language|Mingrelian]] {{lang|xmf|ქართი}} ({{lang|xmf-Latn|Karti}}).

===Early history===
Archaeologists discovered evidence of continuous habitation of the Tbilisi suburb of Dighomi since the early Bronze Age, and stone artifacts dating to the Paleolithic age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://geoarchencyclopedia.ge/ArcheologyEncyclopedia/WebPage/Articles/II-I-East/TreliLB/English/ArticleEngl.html|title=ArticleEngl|website=geoarchencyclopedia.ge|access-date=2019-04-16|archive-date=15 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191215182805/http://geoarchencyclopedia.ge/ArcheologyEncyclopedia/WebPage/Articles/II-I-East/TreliLB/English/ArticleEngl.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age, it was the largest settlement in the Caucasus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isaw.nyu.edu/events/archive/2012/scythians-in-tbilisi|title=The Scythians in Tbilisi: Recent Excavations at Treligorebi|last=cguardia|date=2016-02-03 |website=Institute for the Study of the Ancient World|access-date=2019-04-16|archive-date=16 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190416181555/http://isaw.nyu.edu/events/archive/2012/scythians-in-tbilisi|url-status=live}}</ref> According to legend, the present-day territory of Tbilisi was covered by forests as late as 458. One widely accepted variant of the Tbilisi foundation myth states that King [[Vakhtang I of Iberia]] ({{reign|c. 447/49|502/22}}) went hunting in the heavily wooded region with a [[falcon]] (sometimes the falcon is replaced with either a [[hawk]] or other small [[birds of prey]] in the legend). The king's falcon allegedly caught or injured a [[pheasant]] during the hunt, after which both birds fell into a nearby [[hot spring]] and died from burns. King Vakhtang became so impressed with the hot springs that he decided to clear the forest and build a city on the location.

King [[Dachi of Iberia]] ({{reign|522|534}}), the successor of Vakhtang I, moved the capital of Iberia from [[Mtskheta]] to Tbilisi and began construction of the fortress wall that lined the city's new boundaries.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Edge of empires : a history of Georgia|last=Rayfield|first=Donald|isbn=978-1-78914-059-0|oclc=1053903394|date=11 February 2019|publisher=Reaktion Books }}</ref> From the sixth century, Tbilisi grew at a steady pace due to the region's strategic location along with important trade and travel routes between Europe and Asia.

===Foreign domination===
Tbilisi's favorable trade location, however, did not necessarily bode well for its survival. Located strategically in the heart of the [[Caucasus]] between Europe and Asia, Tbilisi became an object of rivalry among the region's various powers such as the [[Roman Empire]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthia]], [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Persia]], [[Caliphate|Muslim Arabs]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], and the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk Turks]]. The cultural development of the city was somewhat dependent on who ruled the city at various times, although Tbilisi was fairly cosmopolitan.

From 570 to 580, the Persians ruled the city until 627, when [[Third Perso-Turkic War|Tbilisi was sacked]] by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]/[[Khazars|Khazar]] armies and later, in 736–738, Arab armies [[Marwan ibn Muhammad's invasion of Georgia|entered]] the town under [[Marwan II]]. After this point, the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Arabs]] established an [[Emirate of Tbilisi|emirate]] centered in Tbilisi. [[Dirham|Arabic dirhams]] were brought to Georgia following the Arab conquest in the seventh century, and a mint was founded in Tbilisi that produced coins with inscriptions in both [[Arabic]] and Georgian.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|p=242}} In 764, Tbilisi – still under Arab control – was once again sacked by the Khazars. In 853, the armies of Arab leader [[Bugha al-Kabir|Bugha Al-Turki]] invaded Tbilisi in order to enforce its return to [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]] allegiance. The Arab domination of Tbilisi continued until about 1050. In 1065, the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] Sultan [[Alp Arslan]] campaigned against the [[Kingdom of Georgia]], subjugated Tbilisi, and built a mosque in the city.{{sfn|Minorsky|1953|p=65}}

===Capital of Georgia===
In 1121, after the [[Battle of Didgori]] against the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]], the troops of King [[David IV of Georgia]] besieged Tbilisi, taking it in 1122. David moved his residence from [[Kutaisi]] to Tbilisi, making it the capital of a unified [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian State]], thus inaugurating the [[Georgian Golden Age]]. From the 12–13th centuries, Tbilisi became a regional power with a thriving economy and astonishing cultural output. By the end of the 12th century, the population of Tbilisi had reached 100,000. The city also became an important literary and cultural center, not only for Georgia, but also for the [[Eastern Orthodox]] world of the time. During [[Queen Tamar]]'s reign, [[Shota Rustaveli]] worked in Tbilisi while writing his legendary epic poem ''[[The Knight in the Panther's Skin]]''. This period is often referred to as "Georgia's Golden Age"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgianbiography.com/history4.html|publisher=Dictionary of Georgian National Biography|title=The Golden Age of Georgia|access-date=2 February 2008|archive-date=28 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028133708/http://www.georgianbiography.com/history4.html|url-status=live}}</ref> or the Georgian [[Renaissance]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Country Overview|publisher=Invest in Georgia |url=http://www.investingeorgia.info/georgia_profile/country_overview/|access-date=2 February 2008|quote=This early Georgian renaissance ... preceded its European analogue by several hundred years |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080101022941/http://www.investingeorgia.info/georgia_profile/country_overview/|archive-date=1 January 2008}}</ref>

Tbilisi's "Golden Age" did not last for more than a century. In 1226, Tbilisi was captured by the [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarezmian Empire]] under Shah [[Jalal al-Din Mangburni|Jalal al-Din]], who massacred tens of thousands of Christians.{{sfn|Mikaberidze|2015|p=19 }} The Khwarezmian occupation left Tbilisi's defenses severely devastated and prone to further attacks by Mongol armies.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Grousset |first1=René |title=The empire of the steppes: a history of Central Asia |last2=Grousset |first2=René |date=2008 |publisher=Rutgers Univ.

The nation itself maintained a form of "semi-independence" and did not lose its statehood, but Tbilisi would be strongly influenced by the Mongols for the next century, both politically and culturally. In the 1320s, the Mongols retreated from Georgia, and Tbilisi became the capital of an independent Georgian state, once again. However, an outbreak of the [[Black Death]] struck the city in 1366.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Suny |first=Ronald Grigor |title=The making of the Georgian nation |date=1994 |publisher=Indiana Univ. Pr.

Between the late 14th century and the late 18th century, Tbilisi would again be under the rule of various foreign powers. On several occasions, the city would even be completely burned and razed to the ground. In 1386, Tbilisi was [[Timur's invasions of Georgia|invaded and sacked several times]] by the armies of [[Timur|Tamerlane]]. In 1440, the city was [[Turkmen incursions into Georgia|invaded]] and destroyed by [[Jahan Shah]] (the Shah of the town of [[Tabriz]], [[Iran|Persia]]). From 1477 to 1478, the city was held by the [[Aq Qoyunlu|Ak Koyunlu]] tribesmen of [[Uzun Hasan|Uzun Hassan]].

As early as the 1510s, Tbilisi (and the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Kartli|Kartli]] and [[Kingdom of Kakheti|Kakheti]]) were made vassal territories of [[Safavid Iran]].{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|pages=164, 166}} In 1522, Tbilisi was garrisoned for the first time by a large Safavid force.{{sfn|Hitchins|2001|pages=464–470}}{{sfn|Rayfield|2013|page=166}} Following the death of king (''[[shah]]'') [[Ismail I]] (r. 1501–1524), king [[David X of Kartli]] expelled the Iranians. During this period, many parts of Tbilisi were reconstructed and rebuilt. The four campaigns of the king [[Tahmasp I]] (r. 1524–1576) resulted in the reoccupation of Kartli and Kakheti, and a Safavid force was permanently stationed in Tbilisi from 1551 onwards.{{sfn|Hitchins|2001|pages=464–470}}{{sfn|Floor|2008|pages=295–296}} With the 1555 [[Treaty of Amasya]], and more firmly from 1614 to 1747, with brief intermissions, Tbilisi was an important city under Iranian rule, and it functioned as a seat of the Iranian vassal kings of Kartli whom the shah conferred with the title of [[vali (governor)|vali]]. In 1718, the Venetian senate implored the [[Safavid Iran|Safavid emperor]] [[Soltan Hoseyn]] to protect the Catholic Armenians and Capuchin missionaries in Tbilisi from the Gregorian Armenians.{{sfn|Rota|2012|p=152}} Under the later rules of [[Teimuraz II of Kakheti|Teimuraz II]] and [[Heraclius II of Georgia|Heraclius II]], Tbilisi became a vibrant political and cultural center free of foreign rule—but, fearful of the constant threat of invasion, Georgia's rulers sought Russian protection in the 1783 [[Treaty of Georgievsk]]. Despite this agreement, the city was [[Battle of Krtsanisi|captured and devastated]] in 1795 by the Iranian [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] ruler [[Agha Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Mohammad Khan]], who sought to re-establish Iran's traditional sovereignty over the region.{{sfn|Kazemzadeh|1991|pages=328–330}}<ref>Suny, pp. 58–59</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/9137125|title=Relations between Tehran and Moscow, 1797–2014|access-date=15 December 2014|archive-date=1 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501122208/http://www.academia.edu/9137125/Relations_between_Tehran_and_Moscow_1979-2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

Russian Imperial administrators implemented a new European-style city plan and commissioned new buildings in Western styles. Roads and railroads were built to connect Tbilisi to other important cities in the [[Russian Empire]], such as [[Batumi]] and [[Poti]].

The main new artery built under Russian administration was Golovin Avenue (present-day [[Rustaveli Avenue]]), on which the [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Viceroys of the Caucasus]] established their residence.

===Brief independence===
After the [[Russian Revolution|Russian Revolution of 1917]], the city served as a location of the [[Transcaucasia|Transcaucasus]] interim government which established, in the spring of 1918, the short-lived independent [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federation]] with the capital in Tbilisi. At this time, Tbilisi had roughly the same number of Armenians as Georgians, with Russians being the third largest ethnic group.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ethno-kavkaz.narod.ru/rngeorgia.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208080442/http://www.ethno-kavkaz.narod.ru/rngeorgia.html|url-status=dead|title=население грузии|archivedate=8 February 2008|website=www.ethno-kavkaz.narod.ru}}</ref> It was in the former Viceroy of the Caucasus's palace where the independence of three Transcaucasus nations – Georgia, [[Armenia]] and [[Azerbaijan]] – was declared by their respective national councils on 26 to 28 May 1918.

===Soviet rule===
[[File:Red Army in Tbilisi Feb 25 1921.jpg|thumb|The Red Army [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|entered]] Tbilisi on 25 February 1921]]
In 1921, the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]] was [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|occupied]] by the Soviet [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] forces from Russia, and until 1936, Tbilisi functioned first as the capital city of the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]] (which included Armenia, [[Azerbaijan]], and Georgia), and afterward until 1991 as the capital of the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. During Soviet rule, Tbilisi's population grew significantly, the city became more industrialized, and it also came to be an important political, social, and cultural centre of the Soviet Union. In 1980, the city hosted the first state-sanctioned [[Tbilisi Rock Festival (1980)|rock festival]] in the USSR. As a major tourist destination for both Soviet citizens and foreign visitors, Tbilisi's "Old Town" (the neighborhoods within the original city walls) was reconstructed in the 1970s and 1980s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Бабенко|first=Виталий|date=October 1983|script-title=ru:...внутри драгоценного круга|journal=[[Vokrug Sveta]]|volume=1983|issue=10 (2517) |url=http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/vs/article/2120/|access-date=19 August 2012|language=ru|archive-date=28 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130128112304/http://www.vokrugsveta.ru/vs/article/2120/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Tbilisi witnessed mass anti-Russian demonstrations during 1956 in the [[1956 Georgian demonstrations|9 March Massacre]], in protest against the anti-Stalin policies of [[Nikita Khrushchev]]. [[1978 Georgian demonstrations|Peaceful protests]] occurred in 1978, and in 1989 the [[April 9 tragedy]] was a peaceful protest that turned violent.

===Post-independence===
Since the [[History of the Soviet Union (1982–91)|break-up of the Soviet Union]], Tbilisi has experienced periods of significant instability and turmoil. After a brief civil war, which the city endured for two weeks from December 1991 to January 1992 (when pro-[[Zviad Gamsakhurdia|Gamsakhurdia]] and Opposition forces clashed), Tbilisi became the scene of frequent armed confrontations among various [[Russian mafia|mafia]] clans and illegal business operators. During the [[Eduard Shevardnadze|Shevardnadze]] Era (1992–2003), crime and corruption were rampant. Many segments of society became impoverished because of unemployment caused by the crumbling economy. Average citizens of Tbilisi started to become increasingly disillusioned with the existing quality of life in the city (and in the nation in general). Mass protests took place in November 2003 after falsified parliamentary elections forced more than 100,000 people into the streets and concluded with the [[Rose Revolution]]. Since 2003, Tbilisi has experienced considerably more stability with decreasing crime rates, an improved economy, and a real estate boom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbg.gov.ge/uploads/workingpaper/nbgwp01.08.pdf|title=Analysis of Tbilisi's Real Estate Boom|last=Rukhadze|first=Vasili|author2=Tobias Moerschen|year=2007|access-date=22 November 2009|archive-date=9 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101009073042/http://nbg.gov.ge/uploads/workingpaper/nbgwp01.08.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> During the [[Russo-Georgian War|2008 South Ossetia war]], the Tbilisi area was hit by multiple Russian air attacks.

Administratively, the city is divided into [[raion]]s (districts), which have their own units of central and local government with jurisdiction over a limited scope of affairs. This subdivision was established under Soviet rule in the 1930s, following the general [[Subdivisions of the Soviet Union|subdivision of the Soviet Union]]. After Georgia regained independence, the raion system was modified and reshuffled. According to the latest revision, Tbilisi raions include:

Most of the raions are named after historic quarters of the city. The citizens of Tbilisi widely recognize an informal system of smaller historic neighborhoods. Such neighborhoods are several, however, constituting a kind of hierarchy, because most of them have lost their distinctive topographic limits. The natural first level of subdivision of the city is into the right and left banks of the Mtkvari river.

The names of the oldest neighborhoods go back to the early Middle Ages and sometimes pose a great linguistic interest. The newest whole-built developments bear chiefly residential marketing names.

In 19th-century Tbilisi, the Georgian quarter was confined to the southeastern part of the city; Baedeker describes the layout succinctly:

{{blockquote|In the north part of the town, on the left bank of the Kurá and to the south of the railway station, stretches the clean German Quarter, formerly occupied by German immigrants from Württemberg (1818). To the south is the Gruzinian or Georgian Quarter (Avlabár). On the right bank of the Kurá is the Russian Quarter, the seat of the officials and of the larger business firms. This is adjoined on the south by the Armenian and Persian Bazaars.|Karl Baedeker, ''Russia: A Handbook for Travelers''<ref>Karl Baedeker, ''Russia: A Handbook for Travelers'' (Arno Press, 1971, reprint of 1914 ed.), p. 467.</ref>}}

==Geography==
[[File:Fortress and Old Town of Tbilisi at dusk, Tbilisi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|Tbilisi, especially Old Town, has a complex terrain, with hills and cliffs.]]
[[File:Botanic Garden, Tbilisi.jpg|thumb|The [[National Botanical Garden of Georgia]] in Tbilisi is concealed from view as it resides among the hills of the Sololaki Range.]]

===Location===
Tbilisi is located in the [[Transcaucasia|South Caucasus]] at 41° 43' North and 44° 47' East. The city lies in [[Eastern Georgia (country)|Eastern Georgia]] on both banks of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]] (locally known as Mtkvari). The elevation of the city ranges from {{convert|380-770|m|ft|disp=x| [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]] (|)}} and has the shape of an amphitheatre surrounded by mountains on three sides. To the north, Tbilisi is bounded by the [[Saguramo Range]], to the east and south-east by the [[Iori Plain]], to the south and west by various endings (subranges) of the [[Trialeti Range]].

The relief of Tbilisi is complex. The part of the city which lies on the left bank of the Kura River extends for more than {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[Avchala]] District to River Lochini. The part of the city which lies on the right side of the river, though, is built along the foothills of the [[Trialeti Range]], the slopes of which in many cases descend all the way to the edges of the river. The mountains, therefore, are a significant barrier to urban development on its right bank. This type of a geographic environment creates pockets of very densely developed areas, while other parts of the city are left undeveloped due to the complex topographic relief.

To the north of the city, a large reservoir (commonly known as the Tbilisi Sea) is fed by irrigation canals.

===Climate===
[[File:Tbilisi sea 09.23.jpg|thumb|[[Tbilisi Sea]], the city's largest body of water located in the suburbs.]]
Tbilisi has a [[humid temperate climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''[[humid subtropical climate|Cfa]],'' [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''[[Oceanic climate|Do]]'') with considerable [[Humid continental climate|continental]] and [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] influences. The city experiences hot, humid summers and moderately cold dry winters. Like other regions of Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct dry period. The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and [[Caspian Sea]]s) and the fact that the Greater [[Caucasus Mountains]] Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild [[microclimate]] compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.

A minority of the population (around 1.5%) practises [[Islam]] (mainly [[Shia Islam]]), while about 0.1% of Tbilisi's population practises [[Judaism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.geostat.ge/index.php?action=page&p_id=2153&lang=eng|title=GeoStat.Ge|website=www.geostat.ge|access-date=2017-01-31|archive-date=19 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160919222412/http://www.geostat.ge/index.php?action=page&p_id=2153&lang=eng|url-status=live}}</ref> Also, a [[Roman Catholic]] church and the [[Yezidism|Yazidi]] [[Sultan Ezid Temple]] can be found in the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgianholidays.com/sights/churches-in-tbilisi/saint-peter-and-paul-catholic-church|title=Saint Peter and Paul Catholic Church|website=www.georgianholidays.com|access-date=2017-01-31|archive-date=23 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223200142/http://www.georgianholidays.com/sights/churches-in-tbilisi/saint-peter-and-paul-catholic-church|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/world/180620152|title=Yezidis of Georgia celebrate new temple in Tbilisi|newspaper=Rudaw|access-date=2017-01-31|archive-date=22 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210322113514/http://www.rudaw.net/english/world/180620152|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Sports==
[[File:2015 UEFA Super Cup 11.jpg|thumb|Preparations for the [[2015 UEFA Super Cup]] at the [[Boris Paichadze Stadium|Dinamo Arena]] in Tbilisi]]
Until the beginning of the 19th century, sports such as horse-riding ([[polo]] in particular), [[wrestling]], [[boxing]], and [[marksmanship]] were the most popular city sports. Influence from the Russian Empire brought more Western sports and activities (billiards, fencing) to Tbilisi.

The Soviet period brought an increased popularization of sports that were common in Europe and, to a certain extent, the United States. At the same time, Tbilisi developed the necessary infrastructure for professional sports. By 1978, the city had around 250 large and small sports facilities, including, among others, four indoor and six outdoor Olympic-sized pools, 185 basketball courts and halls, 192 volleyball facilities, 82 [[team handball|handball]] arenas, 19 tennis courts, 31 football fields, and five stadiums. The largest stadium in Tbilisi is the [[Dinamo Arena]] (55,000 seats) and the second-largest is the [[Mikheil Meskhi Stadium]] (24,680 seats). The [[Sports Palace (Tbilisi)|Sports Palace]], which usually hosts basketball games with high attendance and tennis tournaments, can seat about 11,000 people. [[Vere Basketball Hall]] is a smaller [[Indoor arena|indoor sports arena]] with a [[seating capacity]] of 2,500.

[[Association football|Football]] is the most popular sport in Tbilisi, followed by [[rugby union|rugby]] and [[basketball]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://act-global.com/en/news/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%9E%E1%83%9D%E1%83%A0%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98/ |title=What is the favorite sport for Tbilisi residents? |access-date=26 May 2021 |archive-date=25 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210525105921/https://act-global.com/en/news/%E1%83%A1%E1%83%9E%E1%83%9D%E1%83%A0%E1%83%A2%E1%83%98/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Other popular sports include [[wrestling]], [[tennis]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], and [[water polo]]. It has several professional football and rugby teams, as well as wrestling clubs. U.S. [[National Basketball Association]] players [[Zaza Pachulia]] and [[Nikoloz Tskitishvili]] are Tbilisi natives. Outside of professional sports, the city has a number of intercollegiate and amateur sports teams and clubs.

Tbilisi's signature football club, [[FC Dinamo Tbilisi|Dinamo Tbilisi]], has not won a major European championship since the [[1980–81 European Cup Winners' Cup|1980–1981]] season, when it won the European [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup]] and became the easternmost team in Europe to achieve the feat. The basketball club Dinamo Tbilisi won the [[Euroleague]] in [[FIBA European Champions Cup 1961-62|1962]], but also never repeated any such feat.

Tbilisi hosted Group A matches for the [[EuroBasket 2022]] at the new 10,000-seat Tbilisi Arena (next to the [[Olympic Palace]]), as one of the tournament co-hosts alongside Czech Republic (Prague), Germany (Berlin, Cologne), and Italy (Milan).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fiba.basketball/eurobasket/2022/news/fiba-europe-delegation-visits-tbilisi-to-see-progress-of-new-arena|title=FIBA Europe delegation visits Tbilisi to see progress of new arena|website=FIBA|date=1 April 2021|accessdate=28 December 2021|archive-date=28 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211228170738/https://www.fiba.basketball/eurobasket/2022/news/fiba-europe-delegation-visits-tbilisi-to-see-progress-of-new-arena|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Georgia to build a new sports complex for European Basketball Championship|url=https://www.agenda.ge/en/news/2019/2068|access-date=31 July 2019|archive-date=8 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211008130004/https://www.agenda.ge/en/news/2019/2068|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Media==
The large majority of Georgia's media companies (including television, newspaper, and radio) are headquartered in Tbilisi. The city is home to the popular television channels [[Rustavi 2]], [[Imedi Media Holding|Imedi]], [[:ka:TV პირველი|TV Pirveli]], [[Mtavari Arkhi]], [[:ka:ფორმულა (ტელეკომპანია)|Formula]], [[Maestro (TV channel)|Maestro]], and the Public Broadcasting Channel, among others. Tbilisi's television market has experienced notable changes since 2019, when changes in the ownership of Rustavi 2 prompted many of its employees to leave and partake in the creation of new television channels, namely Mtavari Arkhi and TV Formula.

Tbilisi has a number of newspaper publishing houses. Some of the most noteworthy newspapers include the daily ''24 Saati'' ("24 Hours"), ''Rezonansi'' ("Resonance"), ''Alia'', the English-language daily ''The Messenger'', weekly ''FINANCIAL, Georgia Today'', and the English-language weekly ''The Georgian Times''. Out of the city's radio stations Imedi Radio (105.9 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]), Fortuna, and Radio 105 are some of the most influential competitors with large national audiences.

Radio stations in Tbilisi include 5 Lines Radio (93.8 FM), Europe +Tbilisi (99.6 FM), and Georgian Patriarchy Radio (105.4 FM).<ref>[http://new.tbilisi.gov.ge/?lang_id=ENG&sec_id=294?lang=eng Tbilisi Municipal Portal – Radio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217224836/http://new.tbilisi.gov.ge/?lang_id=ENG&sec_id=294%3Flang%3Deng |date=17 December 2013 }}</ref>

==Culture==
===Architecture===
[[File:Rustaveli National Theater in Georgia (Europe), built 19th century in Rococo style.jpg|thumb|[[Rustaveli Theatre]] seen on the [[Rustaveli Avenue]]]]
The architecture in the city is a mixture of local (Georgian) and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]], Middle Eastern, and Soviet modern styles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Suny|first1=Ronald Grigor|editor1-last=Curtis|editor1-first=Glen E.|title=Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia|date=1996|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=978-0788128134|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_B2W1YOG3N10C/page/n236 184]|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_B2W1YOG3N10C|quote=(...) Persian occupation added a new element, and in the nineteenth century Russian domination created a hybrid architectural style visible in many buildings in Tbilisi. The so-called Stalinist architecture of the mid-twentieth century also left its mark on the capital."}}</ref> Very few buildings survived the destruction of the city in 1795, so most historical buildings in Tbilisi date to the Russian Imperial period (1801–1917). The oldest parts of the city (Kala, Abanotubani, Avlabari) were largely rebuilt on their medieval street plans, and some old houses were even rebuilt on much older foundations. The areas of downtown Tbilisi which were developed according to a European-style plan by Russian authorities (Sololaki, Rustaveli Avenue, Vera, etc.) have a Western appearance, with a mix of styles popular in Europe at the time: Beaux Arts, Orientalist, and various period revival styles.

Tbilisi is most notable for its abundance of Art Nouveau buildings and details (common in Sololaki and Chughureti), which flourished from the mid-1890s to through the end of Russian rule. Art Nouveau was decreed as bourgeois by communist authorities, who introduced experimental modern architecture. The more conservative and historically inflected [[Stalinist architecture]] in Georgia is embodied by the 1938 Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute building ("Imeli"), now housing the [[Biltmore Hotel Tbilisi]].{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
[[File:2014 Tbilisi, Ulica Erekle II (03).jpg|thumb|upright|Open-air cafés in [[Old Tbilisi]]]]

Tbilisi's postwar architecture is similar to the brand of midcentury modernism found across the Soviet Union. The city expanded dramatically in response to a housing crisis after World War II. Entire neighborhoods (Saburtalo, Dighomi) appeared on the outskirts of the city in a matter of decades, built with advances in mass-production technology. Georgian architects produced some of the Soviet Union's most interesting architectural achievements, including Tbilisi's 1975 [[Bank of Georgia headquarters|Ministry of Roads]] and the 1984 [[Wedding Palace (Tbilisi)|Wedding Palace]]. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the urban landscape is largely characterized by unregulated construction. New towers occupy formerly public spaces and overcrowded apartment buildings sprout "kamikaze loggia" overnight. Since 2004, the city government has taken initiatives to curb uncontrolled construction projects with mixed success. Tbilisi now has several skyscraper complexes, such as the [[:ka:აქსის თაუერსი|Axis Towers]], [[Hilton Garden Inn Tbilisi Chavchavadze]], [[Holiday Inn Tbilisi]], and [[King David Residences]].

===Art museums and galleries===
The [[Georgian National Museum]] gathers several important museums, including the [[Shalva Amiranashvili Museum of Fine Arts|Art Museum of Georgia]].

==Economy==
[[File:Vake District, Tbilisi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|High-rise residential and office buildings in [[Vake, Tbilisi|Vake]].]]
With a nominal GDP of 32&nbsp;billion [[Georgian lari]] ([[Euro|€]]10&nbsp;billion) in 2022, Tbilisi is the economic center of the country, generating more than half of Georgia's GDP. Its GDP per capita of 26,769 Georgian lari (€8,700) is exceeding the national average by more than 50 percent.<ref name=gdp/> The service sector itself is dominated by the wholesale and retail trade sector, reflecting the role of Tbilisi as transit and logistics hub for the country and the South Caucasus. The manufacturing sector contributes only 12 percent to Tbilisi's GDP, but is much larger, by employment and total value added, than the manufacturing sectors in any other region of Georgia. The unemployment rate in Tbilisi is – with 22.5 percent – significantly higher in Tbilisi than in the regions.<ref>{{cite web|title=Regional Statistics|url=http://geostat.ge/index.php?action=page&p_id=1181&lang=eng|publisher=Geostat|access-date=6 April 2016|archive-date=16 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416135238/http://www.geostat.ge/index.php?action=page&p_id=1181&lang=eng|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Transport==
[[File:P1000074 (8849563928).jpg|thumb|[[Tbilisi International Airport]]]]
The public transport system and the relevant infrastructure in Tbilisi is primarily managed by the Transport and Urban Development Agency. After decades of poor transport services and the prioritization of private vehicles, the city has invested heavily in developing a green, extensive and diverse public transit network since the 2010s. Today, the city is served by an international airport, metro and national rail services, municipal buses, minibuses, cabs, cable cars, bike lanes and a funicular.

===Airport===
{{Main|Tbilisi International Airport}}
[[Tbilisi International Airport|Shota Rustaveli Tbilisi International Airport]] is Tbilisi's only international airport, located about {{convert|18|km|0|abbr=off}} southeast of the city center. Handling 2.99&nbsp;million passengers in 2022, it is the busiest airport in Georgia and the [[List of the busiest airports in the former USSR|twentieth busiest airport in the former Soviet Union]]. The airport has been rapidly growing over the past decade, handling more than 3.56&nbsp;million passengers in 11 months of 2018.<ref>{{cite web|title=Passenger Traffic up by 23% at Georgian Airports|url=http://georgiatoday.ge/news/13646/Passenger-Traffic-up-by-23%25-at-Georgian-Airports|publisher=Georgian today|access-date=10 December 2018|archive-date=10 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181210182829/http://georgiatoday.ge/news/13646/Passenger-Traffic-up-by-23%25-at-Georgian-Airports|url-status=live}}</ref> It is a hub for the national carrier [[Georgian Airways]] and Georgian-Chinese start-up [[MyWay Airlines|Myway Airlines]]. 
Various international carriers serve routes to major European and Asian hubs, such as London, Munich, Berlin, Amsterdam, Dubai, Brussels, Milan, Vienna, Paris, and Doha. The Irish ultra-low-cost carrier [[Ryanair]] started operating from the airport in 2019.

Tbilisi International Airport in 2016 started to utilize solar energy and became the first "green airport" in the Caucasus region in 2008.

[[Natakhtari Airfield]], located 33&nbsp;km north of Tbilisi in the town of [[Natakhtari]], is a domestic airport serving the capital on routes to [[Batumi]], [[Mestia]] and [[Ambrolauri]].

{{Main|Tbilisi Metro}}

The [[Tbilisi Metro]] serves the city with [[rapid transit]] subway services. More than 400,000 journeys are made on the system every single day. It was the Soviet Union's fourth metro system. Construction began in 1952 and was finished in 1966.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History |url=http://ttc.com.ge/index.php/en/history |access-date=2023-12-22 |website=ttc.com.ge |language=en}}</ref> The system operates two lines, the [[Akhmeteli-Varketili Line]] and the [[Saburtalo Line]]. It has 23 stations and 186 metro cars. Most stations, characteristic to Soviet-built metro systems, are extravagantly decorated. Trains run from 6:00&nbsp;am to midnight. Due to the uneven ground, the rail lines run above ground in some areas. Two of the stations are above ground.

In 2020, it was announced by the city government that the metro system is set for a major upgrade with the renovation of all stations, targeting more sustainable and modern design, as well as step-free wheelchair accessibility. Moreover, Tbilisi will purchase 40 new, modern train cars, or 10 trains, becoming the first major rolling stock upgrade in the network's more than 50-year-old history.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://emerging-europe.com/news/tbilisi-metro-set-for-timely-upgrade/ |title=Tbilisi metro set for timely upgrade |journal=Vestnik Kavkaza |date=4 May 2020 |access-date=2020-05-04 |archive-date=19 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210319112208/https://emerging-europe.com/news/tbilisi-metro-set-for-timely-upgrade/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The third overground line is planned to connect central Tbilisi with suburbs and [[Tbilisi International Airport]] with a possible extension to [[Rustavi]], 30&nbsp;km east of Tbilisi.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/New-metro-stations-to-link-center-and-outskirts-of-Tbilisi.html |title=New metro stations to link center and outskirts of Tbilisi |journal=Vestnik Kavkaza |date=22 October 2018 |access-date=2019-01-15 |archive-date=15 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190115234220/http://vestnikkavkaza.net/news/New-metro-stations-to-link-center-and-outskirts-of-Tbilisi.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Rail===
Tbilisi is the busiest intersection of [[Georgian Railways]] services, primarily centred within [[Tbilisi railway station|Tbilisi Central Railway Station]]. From there, the national rail operator offers inter-city services to [[Batumi]], [[Zugdidi]], [[Poti]], [[Ozurgeti]], [[Kutaisi]] and other large cities, as well as several suburban rail services.

===Buses===
Tbilisi's bus network forms a crucial backbone of the city's transit system. For almost a decade, up to 700 outdated buses of various size were serving the city, majority of them were [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] [[Bogdan (bus company)|Bogdan]] A144 and A092 models. Nowadays the city has an extensive network of municipal buses, including a growing number of night bus services. In August 2020, the mayor of Tbilisi [[Kakha Kaladze]] announced major changes in the existing public transit system. Notably, the city will have 10 [[Bus Rapid Transit]] corridors in the near future, served by large 18-meter-long buses running at significantly shorter intervals. These services are named TBT (Tbilisi Bus Transit) lines and are indexed numbers from 300 until 310. Besides the TBT lines, the new system includes 44 city and 185 local lines, totalling up to over 240 bus routes within the city.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tbilisi Mayor Unveils Major Public Transit System Changes|url=https://civil.ge/archives/364069|date=28 August 2020|access-date=28 August 2020|archive-date=8 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200908115451/https://civil.ge/archives/364069|url-status=live}}</ref>

The initial reorganization of the bus network started in 2016 when then-mayor [[Davit Narmania]] started an ambitious project in efforts to revamp the outdated fleet. Under his city government, 143 energy-efficient [[MAN Lion's City]] buses were purchased and delivered in 2017.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tbilisi buys 143 new longer, gas-powered buses|url=http://dfwatch.net/tbilisi-buys-143-new-gas-powered-buses-43718|date=13 July 2016|access-date=23 October 2018|archive-date=19 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019161847/http://dfwatch.net/tbilisi-buys-143-new-gas-powered-buses-43718|url-status=live}}</ref> Later, in 2018, a tender was announced to order 90 new buses. Tegeta Truck & Bus won the tender and delivered 90 Man Lion's City low floor buses to the city in early 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tbilisi City Hall to Convey 90 New Buses|url=http://cbw.ge/georgia/tbilisi-city-hall-to-convey-90-new-buses/|date=8 August 2018|access-date=17 October 2016|archive-date=9 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180809123029/http://cbw.ge/georgia/tbilisi-city-hall-to-convey-90-new-buses/|url-status=live}}</ref> Later on, the city purchased more than 400 new buses from two different manufacturers, including 12-meter-long, low floor BMC vehicles and shorter, 8.5-meter-long Isuzu city buses. It was also announced that the city will buy 200 18-meter-long articulated buses in the near future in hopes of further expanding the city's bus network and decreasing intervals.<ref>{{cite web|title=126 new buses to start serving passengers in Tbilisi tomorrow|url=https://agenda.ge/en/news/2020/3295|date=20 October 2020|access-date=20 October 2020|archive-date=31 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031084136/https://agenda.ge/en/news/2020/3295|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Cycling===
Cycling has become increasingly popular among the residents of Tbilisi over the past few years. For decades, this green mode of transport was seen unfit for the mountainous and uneven terrain of the city. However, as the city's government started introducing new bike lanes across the city, a rising number of people turned towards bikes for regular use. One of the first major central Tbilisi bike lanes opened along Pekini Avenue in 2017, following a long rehabilitation process.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://agenda.ge/en/news/2017/2035 |title= New bicycle track opens in Tbilisi |website= Agenda.ge |date= 20 September 2017 |access-date= 20 September 2017 |language= ka |archive-date= 28 May 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210528124103/https://agenda.ge/en/news/2017/2035 |url-status= live }}</ref> The 2.8 meter wide lane failed to attract regular users amid the lack of a greater, city-wide network. Soon the city unveiled more bike lanes, including within recreational areas, such as the [[National Botanical Garden of Georgia]] and [[Lisi Lake]].

The expansion of the city's [[cycling infrastructure]] network was significantly accelerated during the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] as cities across the globe started organizing pop-up bike lanes. Tbilisi joined the global trend, unveiling cycling lanes in city's central areas, such as Vake, Vera and the bank of the [[Kura (Caspian Sea)|Kura River]]. Following these changes, the total length of Tbilisi's bike lanes increased from 2&nbsp;km in 2019 to over 20&nbsp;km in 2020. The head of the city's transport department told Euronews Georgia that Tbilisi is working on a 20-year long urban mobility development strategy. According to the plan, the total length of the bike lane network will eventually reach 350&nbsp;km across the capital.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://euronewsgeorgia.com/2021/02/08/%e1%83%97%e1%83%91%e1%83%98%e1%83%9a%e1%83%98%e1%83%a1%e1%83%98%e1%83%a1-%e1%83%95%e1%83%94%e1%83%9a%e1%83%9d%e1%83%91%e1%83%98%e1%83%9a%e1%83%98%e1%83%99%e1%83%94%e1%83%91%e1%83%98/ |title= თბილისის მერია მობილობის ოცწლიან სტრატეგიაზე მუშაობს |website= Euronewsgeorgia.com |date= 8 February 2021 |access-date= 8 February 2021 |language= ka |archive-date= 28 May 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210528124127/https://euronewsgeorgia.com/2021/02/08/tbilisis-meria-mobilobis-ocwlian-strategiaze-mushaobs/ |url-status= live }}</ref>

===Tram===
{{Main|Trams in Tbilisi}}
Tbilisi had a tram network starting in 1883 with horse-driven trams, followed by electric trams in 1904. After the Soviet Union disintegrated, due to electricity deficit the electric transport went into decline, and finally the only tram line left was closed on 4 December 2006, along with the two remaining trolleybus lines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.subways.net/georgia/tbilisi.htm|access-date=24 December 2010|title=Subways and Trams in Georgia: Tbilisi|date=24 December 2010|archive-date=4 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104052350/http://www.subways.net/georgia/tbilisi.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5011&Itemid=70|access-date=24 December 2010|title=georgiandaily.com – Nostalgic Tbilisi residents want their tramway back|date=24 December 2010|quote=-|archive-date=1 January 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100101210317/http://georgiandaily.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=5011&Itemid=70|url-status=live}}</ref> There were plans to construct a modern tram network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/tbilisi-tram-design-contract-signed.html|access-date=24 December 2010|title=Railway Gazette: Tbilisi tram design contract signed|date=24 December 2010|archive-date=11 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211200955/http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/tbilisi-tram-design-contract-signed.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiatoday.ge/article_details.php?id=8365 |access-date=24 December 2010 |title=Trams to return? : by Salome Kobalava : Georgia Today on the Web |date=24 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110119032646/http://georgiatoday.ge/article_details.php?id=8365 |archive-date=19 January 2011 }}</ref>

===Minibus===
For a long time, the most dominant form of transport was the [[marshrutka|minibus]] network. An elaborate minibus system grew in Tbilisi over the early 2000s. Amid the lack of public funding and rundown infrastructure, minibuses emerged as a private initiative and a short-term solution to the city's transportation problem. In 2019, the company operating yellow minibuses in Tbilisi was asked to replace the entire fleet by the end of 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://bm.ge/ka/article/yviteli-samarshruto-taqsebi-2020-wlis-bolomde-axali-mikroavtobusebit-unda-chanacvldes/34820 |title= "ყვითელი სამარშრუტო ტაქსები 2020 წლის ბოლომდე ახალი მიკროავტობუსებით უნდა ჩანაცვლდეს" |website= bm.ge |date= 4 June 2019 |access-date= 4 June 2019 |language= ka |archive-date= 28 May 2021 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20210528124105/https://bm.ge/ka/article/yviteli-samarshruto-taqsebi-2020-wlis-bolomde-axali-mikroavtobusebit-unda-chanacvldes/34820 |url-status= live }}</ref> However, the process was slowed down and only 300 minibuses were replaced. The mayor of Tbilisi announced that the number of minibuses in Tbilisi will gradually decrease, eventually vanishing from Tbilisi's streets.

In addition to the city, several lines also serve the surrounding countryside of Tbilisi. Throughout the city, a fixed price is paid regardless of the distance (80 or 50 [[tetri]] in 2018). For longer trips outside the city, higher fares are common. As of April 2018, there are no predefined stops for the minibus lines, except 14 streets;<ref>{{cite web |url= http://commersant.ge/?view=post&id=136776&lang_id=ge |title= თბილისის ქუჩები, სადაც სამარშრუტო ტაქსები მხოლოდ გაჩერების ადგილებზე გაჩერდებიან |website= commersant.ge |date= 28 December 2017 |access-date= 7 April 2018 |language= ka }}{{Dead link|date=May 2021 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> they are hailed from the streets like taxis and each passenger can exit whenever they prefer.

===Aerial tramways===
Historically, the city had seven different aerial tramways, but many of them closed after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

Since 2012, a [[gondola lift]] has operated between Rike Park and the [[Narikala fortress]]; each gondola can carry up to eight people. The system was built by the Italian manufacturer [[Leitner Ropeways]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civil.ge/eng/category.php?id=87&size=wide&gallery=86|title=Tbilisi Ropeway|access-date=17 March 2013|archive-date=6 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106012714/http://www.civil.ge/eng/category.php?id=87&size=wide&gallery=86|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 12 October 2016 the Turtle Lake aerial tramway (originally opened in 1965) reopened after seven years out of service. It underwent major reconstruction but kept the old designs of gondolas and stations. This tramway connects [[Vake Park]] with [[Turtle Lake (Tbilisi)|Turtle Lake]].

On 19 April 2021 another Soviet-era aerial tramway between the State University (Maglivi) and the University Campus (Bagebi) in Saburtalo District (originally opened in 1982) was opened after reconstruction works took place in 2016–2018. The original Italian cabins, produced by Lovisolo and provided by Ceretti & Tanfani, with a capacity of 40 passengers each, were kept, as were the stations.

In 1990, one of the main aerial trams experienced a major malfunction, causing the [[1990 Tbilisi aerial tramway accident]] and remaining closed ever since.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9907/01/france.cable.car.04/list.html |title=Major worldwide cable car accidents since 1976 |publisher=CNN |access-date=19 December 2012 |archive-date=17 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417181207/http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9907/01/france.cable.car.04/list.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Since October 2017, the aerial tram has been under reconstruction, keeping the old culturally significant lower station but with plans for new gondolas, masts, upper station and other infrastructure. The project is carried out by [[Doppelmayr Garaventa Group]].

===Funicular===

The Tbilisi funicular reopened in 2012 after a multi-year closure. It is a ropeway railway first built in 1905, connecting Chonkadze Street and [[Mtatsminda Park]], and covering almost {{Convert|300|m|abbr=on}} in altitude difference. The top of the hill is the highest point of the city, offering many different views of Tbilisi, and is home to the [[Tbilisi TV Broadcasting Tower]] as well as some amusement rides, including a rollercoaster and a ferris wheel.

The half-way station of the funicular is located near the [[Mtatsminda Pantheon]], providing easy access to the necropolis.

==Education==
[[File:Classical School No.1 of Tbilisi, Georgia.jpg|thumb|right|Public School Number 1 of Tbilisi, also known as the [[Gymnasium (school)|First Classical Gymnasium]]]]

Tbilisi is home to several major institutions of higher education, including the Tbilisi State Medical University and the Petre Shotadze Tbilisi Medical Academy, famous for their internationally recognized medical education systems. The biggest Georgian university is [[Tbilisi State University]] (TSU), which was established on 8 February 1918. TSU is the oldest university in the whole Caucasus region, with up to 25,000 students enrolled and approximately 5,000 faculty members and staff (collaborators).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://old.tsu.ge/data/file_db/PR/bukleti_2019%20_eng.pdf|title=Student Guide|website=old.tsu.ge|access-date=18 August 2023}}</ref> Tbilisi is also home to the largest medical university in the Caucasus region – [[Tbilisi State Medical University]], which was founded as the Tbilisi Medical Institute in 1918 and became the Faculty of Medicine within the Tbilisi State University in 1930. Tbilisi State Medical Institute was renamed to Medical University in 1992. Since it operates as an independent educational institution, it has become one of the highest-ranking state-supported institutions of higher education in the Caucasus region. As of 2023, there are over 7,000 undergraduate and 3,000 postgraduate students at the university, of whom about a quarter come from foreign countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tsmu.edu/ts/content/2/147/0/0/0/0|title=HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY|website=tsmu.edu|access-date=17 August 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://gyanberry.com/blog/tbilisi-state-medical-university-tsmu-georgia|title=Tbilisi State Medical University: Rankings, Courses, Admissions, Fees, and Scholarships|website=gyanberry.com|date=28 October 2021 |access-date=17 August 2023}}</ref>

Georgia's main and largest technical university, [[Georgian Technical University]], is in Tbilisi. It was founded in 1922 as a polytechnic faculty of the Tbilisi State University. The first lecture was read by world-famous Georgian mathematician Professor Andria Razmadze. It was transformed into an independent institute in 1928, until it was finally granted University status in 1990.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gtu.ge/Eng/Info/History.php|title=HISTORY OF FOUNDATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE GEORGIAN TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY|website=gtu.ge|access-date=18 August 2023}}</ref>

Caucasus University was established in 2004 as an expansion of the Caucasus School of Business (CSB, established in 1998) by a consortium consisting of Tbilisi State University and Georgian Technical University in partnership with Georgia State University (Atlanta, USA).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cu.edu.ge/en/cu-international-students/about-cu-international-students|title=About CU|website=cu.edu.ge|access-date=18 August 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://study-georgia.ge/georgian-technical-university|title=Georgian Technical University|website=study-georgia.ge|access-date=18 August 2023}}</ref>

The Free University of Tbilisi was established in 2007 through a merger of two higher education schools: the European School of Management (ESM-Tbilisi) and the Tbilisi Institute of Asia and Africa (TIAA), both of which then became schools within the university. Aside from that, the Free University now comprises six other schools — Law School, Governance and Social Sciences, Visual Arts and Design (VAADS), Mathematics and Computer Science (MACS), Physics, and Doctoral School in Social and Humanitarian Sciences — that deliver academic programs at the undergraduate, graduate and doctorate levels. In addition, Free University conducts a wide array of short-term courses and runs several research centers and summer school programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://freeuni.edu.ge/en/university-today |title=University Today |website=freeuni.edu.ge |access-date=17 August 2023 |archive-date=17 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230817190616/https://freeuni.edu.ge/en/university-today |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://freeuni.edu.ge/en/structure-eng |title=Structure |website=freeuni.edu.ge |access-date=17 August 2023 |archive-date=17 August 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230817190604/https://freeuni.edu.ge/en/structure-eng |url-status=dead }}</ref>
