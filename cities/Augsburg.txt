After [[Neuss]], [[Trier]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Cologne]] and [[Xanten]], Augsburg is one of Germany's oldest cities, founded in 15 BC by the Romans as [[Augsburg#Early history|Augusta Vindelicorum]] and named after the [[Roman emperor]] [[Augustus]]. It was a [[Free Imperial City]] from 1276 to 1803 and the home of the [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] [[Fugger]] and [[Welser]] families that dominated European banking in the 16th century. According to Behringer, in the sixteenth century it became "the dominant centre of early capitalism", having benefited from being part of the [[Kaiserliche Reichspost]] system as "the location of the most important post office within the Holy Roman Empire" and the city's close connection to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]].{{sfn|Behringer|2011|p=350}} The city played a leading role in the [[Reformation]] as the site of the 1530 [[Augsburg Confession]] and the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]]. The [[Fuggerei]], the oldest social housing complex in the world, was founded in 1513 by [[Jakob Fugger]].<ref>Rollenhagen, L., [https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-fuggerei-the-worlds-oldest-social-housing-project/a-58928076 ''Germany's Fuggerei is world's oldest social housing project''], 2024, [[Deutsche Welle]]</ref><ref>Billock, J., [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/after-almost-500-years-german-utopia-is-still-going-strong-180973787/ ''After Almost 500 Years, the World’s Oldest Social Housing Complex Is Still Going Strong''], [[Smithsonian (magazine)|''Smithsonian Magazine'']], 2024</ref>

In 2019 [[UNESCO]] recognised the Water Management System of Augsburg as a [[World Heritage Site]] because of its unique medieval canals and water towers and its testimony to the development of hydraulic engineering.<ref name = "unesco">{{cite web |url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1580 |title = Water Management System of Augsburg |website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization |access-date = 1 Oct 2022 |archive-date = 6 October 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20201006205033/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1580 |url-status = live }}</ref>

==Geography==
Augsburg lies at the convergence of the [[Alps|Alpine]] rivers [[Lech (river)|Lech]] and [[Wertach (river)|Wertach]] and on the [[Singold]]. The oldest part of the city and the southern quarters are on the northern foothills of a high terrace, which has emerged between the steep rim of the hills of [[Friedberg (Bayern)|Friedberg]] in the east and the high hills of the west. In the south extends the Lechfeld, an [[outwash plain]] of the post [[ice age]] between the rivers Lech and Wertach, where rare primeval landscapes were preserved. The Augsburg city forest and the Lech valley heaths today rank among the most species-rich middle European habitats.<ref name="KelceyMüller2011">{{cite book |author1=John G. Kelcey |author2=Norbert Müller |title=Plants and Habitats of European Cities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lUA-LzswzNsC |date=7 June 2011 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=978-0-387-89684-7 |access-date=10 May 2018 |archive-date=15 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240315175310/https://books.google.com/books?id=lUA-LzswzNsC |url-status=live }}</ref>

Augsburg borders the [[nature park]] [[Augsburg Western Woods Nature Park|Augsburg Western Woods]], a large forestland. The city itself is also heavily verdant. As a result, in 1997 Augsburg was the first German city to win the Europe-wide contest [[Entente Florale]] for Europe's greenest and most livable city.

===Augsburg Confession===

Augsburg was granted the status of a [[Free Imperial City]] on 9 March 1276 and from then until 1803, it was independent of its former overlord, the [[Prince-Bishopric of Augsburg|Prince-Bishop of Augsburg]]. Frictions between the city-state and the prince-bishops were to remain frequent however, particularly after Augsburg became [[Protestant]] and curtailed the rights and freedoms of [[Catholics]]. With its strategic location at an intersection of trade routes to Italy, the Free Imperial City of Augsburg became a major trading centre.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Augsburg produced large quantities of woven goods, cloth and textiles. Augsburg became the base of two banking families that rose to great prominence, the [[Fugger]]s and the [[Welser]]s. The Fugger family donated the [[Fuggerei]] part of the city devoted to housing for needy citizens in 1516, which remains in use today.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/after-almost-500-years-german-utopia-is-still-going-strong-180973787/ |title=After Almost 500 Years, the World's Oldest Social Housing Complex is Still Going Strong |access-date=17 September 2021 |archive-date=31 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220331115025/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/after-almost-500-years-german-utopia-is-still-going-strong-180973787/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1530, the [[Augsburg Confession]] was presented to the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] at the [[Diet of Augsburg]]. Following the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555, after which the rights of religious minorities in imperial cities were to be legally protected, a mixed Catholic–Protestant city council presided over a majority Protestant population; ''see [[:de:Paritätische Reichsstadt|Paritätische Reichsstadt]]''.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Augsburg Confession |encyclopedia=World History Encyclopedia |date=26 January 2022 |last=Mark |first=Joshua J. |url=https://www.worldhistory.org/Augsburg_Confession/#citation_info |access-date=26 April 2023 |archive-date=26 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230426233021/https://www.worldhistory.org/Augsburg_Confession/#citation_info |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Leading European centre of capitalism of the sixteenth century===
[[File:Seld Joerg Vogelschauplan von Westen Augsburg.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=1.8|A "bird’s-eye view" plan of western Augsburg, 1521]]
Augsburg's economic boom years occurred during the 15th and 16th centuries thanks to the [[bank]] and [[metal]] businesses of the merchant families [[Fugger]], [[Welser]] and [[Hochstetter family|Hochstetter]]. These families held a near total monopoly in important industries. Monopolies were considered criminal in contemporary laws and these families' practices were criticised by [[Martin Luther]] himself, but as [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles V]] needed their financial assistance, he cancelled the charge in the 1530s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Luther |first1=Martin |title=On Commerce and Usury (1524) |date=15 September 2015 |publisher=Anthem Press |isbn=978-1-78308-387-9 |page=146 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rvs1DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA146 |access-date=7 August 2022 |language=en |archive-date=15 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240315175247/https://books.google.com/books?id=rvs1DgAAQBAJ&pg=PA146 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=studio |first1=Istituto internazionale di storia economica F.

Augsburg was a major [[manufacturing]] centre for [[textile]]s, [[armor]], [[scientific instrument]]s, as well as gold- and silver-smithing. The prolific [[Printing press|printer]]s of Augsburg also made the city the largest producer of German-language [[books]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Like other [[free imperial cities]], Augsburg was an independent entity, and had authority over its [[tax]] policies.<ref>{{cite book |first1=B.

Augsburg's wealth attracted artists seeking [[patron]]s. The city rapidly became a creative centre for [[sculptor]]s and [[musician]]s. Augsburg became the base of the Holbein family, starting with [[Hans Holbein the Elder]]. The composer [[Leopold Mozart]] was born and educated in Augsburg.<ref name="allmusic">{{cite web |url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/leopold-mozart-mn0001498289/biography |publisher=allmusic.com |title=Leopold Mozart: Biography & History |access-date=24 February 2017 |archive-date=9 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170709062915/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/leopold-mozart-mn0001498289/biography |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Rococo]] became so prevalent that it became known as "Augsburg style" throughout Germany.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Augsburg benefitted majorly from the establishment and expansion of the [[Kaiserliche Reichspost]] in the late 15th and early 16th century. This postal system, which was the first modern postal service in the world, was created through negotiations and agreements between the Taxis family represented by {{ill|Franz von Taxis|de}} and the early Habsburgs monarches, notably [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian I]], his son [[Philip I, King of Castile|Philip the Handsome]] and grandson Charles V.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Metzig |first1=Gregor |title=Kommunikation und Konfrontation: Diplomatie und Gesandtschaftswesen Kaiser Maximilians I.

From Maximilian's time, as the "terminuses of the first transcontinental post lines" began to shift from [[Innsbruck]] to [[Venice]] and from [[Brussels]] to [[Antwerp]], in these cities, the communication system and the news market started to converge. As the Fuggers as well as other trading companies based their most important branches in these cities, these traders gained access to these systems as well (despite a widely circulated theory which holds that the Fuggers themselves operated their own communication system, in reality they relied upon the imperial posts, presumably from the 1490s onwards, as official members of the court of Maximilian I).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Behringer |first1=Wolfgang |contribution=Core and Periphery: The Holy Roman Empire as a Communication(s) Universe |title=The Holy Roman Empire, 1495-1806 |date=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=9780199602971 |pages=347–358|url=https://perspectivia.net/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/pnet_derivate_00004689/behringer_core.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://perspectivia.net/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/pnet_derivate_00004689/behringer_core.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |access-date=7 August 2022}}</ref>

===Witch hunts===
Several [[witch hunts]] occurred in Augsburg in the late 16th century. Following the 1585–1588 [[Plague (disease)|plague]] epidemic, southeast Germany was shattered by the 1589–1591 witch hunts. Following the 1592–1593 plague epidemic, cities in southeast Germany entered a period of [[inflation]], marked by brutal witch hunts in urban areas.<ref>{{cite book |title=Witchcraft Persecutions in Bavaria: Popular Magic, Religious Zealotry and Reason of State in Early Modern Europe |first1=Wolfgang |last1=Behringer |date=2003 |page=95 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521525107}}</ref>

===Thirty Years' War===
Religious peace in the city was largely maintained despite increasing tensions up to the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648). In 1629, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] issued the [[Edict of Restitution]], which restored the legal situation of 1552. However, the edict was revoked in April 1632, when [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden]] occupied Augsburg.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

In 1634, the Swedish army was defeated at the nearby [[Battle of Nördlingen (1634)|Battle of Nördlingen]]. By October 1634, Catholic troops had surrounded Augsburg. The Swedish army refused to surrender and a [[siege]] ensued through the winter of 1634/35 and thousands died from hunger and disease. During the Swedish occupation and the siege by Catholic troops, the population of the city was reduced from about 70,000 to about 16,000. Diseases such as [[typhus]] and the plague ravaged the city.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hays |first1=J.

===Guilds===
In the first half of the 17th century Augsburg was pivotal in the European network of [[goldsmith]]s. Augsburg attracted goldsmith journeymen from all over Europe and in the 18th century a large number of [[silversmith]]s and goldsmiths became [[master craftsman]] in Augsburg.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Maarten |last1=Prak |first2=S.

===Nine Years' War===
In 1686 the [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Leopold I]] formed the ''League of Augsburg'', also known as the "Grand Alliance" after England joined in 1689. The [[coalition]] consisted at various times of Austria, [[Bavaria]], [[Brandenburg]], England, the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]], Portugal, [[Savoy]], [[Saxony]], Spain, Sweden, and the [[Dutch Republic]]. The coalition was formed to defend the Electorate of the Palatinate and fought against France in the [[Nine Years' War]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

The [[Reichsdeputationshauptschluss]] or the Final Recess of 1803, saw the annexation of nearly all of the 51 Free Imperial Cities, excepting Augsburg and five others. However, when the [[Holy Roman Empire]] was dissolved in 1806, Napoleon encouraged his German allies to annex their smaller neighbours, and Augsburg lost its independence. It was annexed to the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]]. In 1817, the city became an administrative capital of the ''Oberdonaukreis'', then administrative capital in 1837 for the district [[Swabia (administrative region)|Swabia and Neuburg]].{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

===Industrial revolution===
During the end of the 19th century, [[Augsburg textile and industry museum|Augsburg's textile industry]] again rose to prominence followed by the machine manufacturing industry.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

===Second World War and Cold War===
Augsburg was historically a militarily important city due to its strategic location. During the German re-armament before the [[World War II|Second World War]], the Wehrmacht enlarged Augsburg's one original Kaserne (barracks) to three: Somme Kaserne (housing Wehrmacht Artillerie-Regiment 27); Arras Kaserne (housing Wehrmacht Infanterie Regiment 27) and Panzerjäger Kaserne (housing Panzerabwehr-Abteilung 27 (later Panzerjäger-Abteilung 27)). Wehrmacht Panzerjäger-Abteilung 27 was later moved to [[Füssen]].

The [[MAN SE|MAN]] factory at Augsburg was the largest German manufacturer of engines for U-boats in [[World War II]] and became the target of the Augsburg Raid. When the [[Avro Lancaster]] bomber was new in service, the [[RAF]] sent 12 at low level to bomb the factory in daylight, on 17 April 1942. The bombers were intercepted en route and only five returned, all damaged. The factory was damaged but production continued; the factory was repeatedly bombed later. A subcamp of the [[Dachau concentration camp]] outside Augsburg supplied approximately 1,300 forced labourers to local military-related industry, especially the [[Messerschmitt]] AG military aircraft firm, headquartered in Augsburg.<ref>Wolfgang Sofsky, William Templer, ''The Order of Terror: The Concentration Camp'': Princeton University Press: 1999, {{ISBN|0-691-00685-7}}, page 183</ref><ref>Edward Victor.

In 1941 [[Rudolf Hess]], without [[Adolf Hitler]]'s permission, secretly took off from a local Augsburg airport and flew to Scotland, crashing in [[Eaglesham]], to the south of Glasgow. His objective was to meet the [[Douglas Douglas-Hamilton, 14th Duke of Hamilton|Duke of Hamilton]] in an attempt to mediate the end of the European front of [[World War II]] and join sides for the upcoming Russian Campaign.

The Reichswehr Infanterie Regiment 19 was stationed in Augsburg and became the base unit for the Wehrmacht Infanterie Regiment 40, a subsection of the Wehrmacht Infanterie Division 27 (which later became the Wehrmacht Panzerdivision 17). Elements of Wehrmacht II Battalion of Gebirgs-Jäger-Regiment 99 (especially Wehrmacht Panzerjäger Kompanie 14) was composed of parts of the Wehrmacht Infanterie Division 27. The Infanterie Regiment 40 remained in Augsburg until the end of the war, finally surrendering to the United States on 28 April 1945 when the [[U.S. Army]] occupied the city. The city and its Messerschmitt works were [[Bombing of Augsburg in World War II|bombed on three occasions]] during the war. Collateral damage included the destruction of just under 25% of all homes in the city and the deaths of several hundred people.<ref name=diaryfeb44>{{cite web |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/feb44.html |title=Campaign Diary February 1944 |work=Royal Air Force Bomber Command 60th Anniversary |access-date=7 December 2014 |publisher=UK Crown |url-status=dead |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20070706011932/http:/www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/feb44.html |archive-date=6 July 2007}}</ref>

Following the war the three Kasernen changed hands confusingly between the [[United States|American]] and Germans, finally ending up in US hands for the duration of the [[Cold War]]. They became the three main US barracks in Augsburg: Reese, Sheridan and FLAK. US Base FLAK had been an anti-aircraft barracks since 1936 and US Base Sheridan 'united' the former infantry barracks with a smaller Kaserne for former [[Luftwaffe]] communications units.

The American military presence in the city started with the U.S. 5th Infantry Division stationed at FLAK Kaserne from 1945 to 1955, then by [[U.S. 11th Airborne Division|11th Airborne Division]], followed by the [[24th Infantry Division (United States)|24th Infantry Division]], U.S. Army [[VII Corps (United States)|VII Corps]] artillery, [[701st Military Intelligence Brigade|USASA Field Station Augsburg]] and finally the [[66th Military Intelligence Brigade (United States)|66th Military Intelligence Brigade]], which returned the former Kaserne to German hands in 1998. Originally the Heeresverpflegungshauptamt Südbayern and an Officers' caisson existed on or near the location of Reese-Kaserne but was demolished by the occupying Americans.

===Municipality===
{{main|List of mayors of Augsburg}}
From 1266 until 1548, the terms ''Stadtpfleger'' (head of town council) and ''[[Mayor]]'' were used interchangeably, or occasionally, simultaneously. In 1548 the title was finally fixed to ''Stadtpfleger'', who officiated for several years and was then awarded the title for life (though no longer governing), thus resulting confusingly, in records of two or more simultaneous ''Stadtpfleger''.

After the transfer to [[Bavaria]] in 1806, Augsburg was ruled by a [[Magistrate]] with two mayors, supported by an additional council of "Community Commissioners": the ''Gemeindebevollmächtige''.

As of 1907, the Mayor was entitled [[Lord Mayor|Oberbürgermeister]], as Augsburg had reached a population of 100,000, as per the Bavarian [[Gemeindeordnung]].

===Mayor===
The mayor of Augsburg has been Eva Weber of the [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU) since 2020. The most recent mayoral election was held on 15 March 2020, with a runoff held on 29 March, and the results were as follows:

Augsburg has a population of about 300,000. It is the third largest city in [[Bavaria]] and the largest city in the [[Swabia (Bavaria)|Swabia]] region. In the 16th century, Augsburg was one of the largest cities in [[Holy Roman Empire]], with a population of about 30,000. This put it on a level with cities like [[Cologne]] and [[Prague]].

==Transport==

===Roads===
The main road link is [[autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 8|A 8]] between [[Munich]] and [[Stuttgart]].

====Public transport====
Public transport is very well catered for. It is controlled by the [[Augsburger Verkehrs- und Tarifverbund]] (Augsburg transport and tariff association, AVV) extended over central Swabia. There are seven rail [[Regionalbahn]] lines, five [[tram]] lines, 27 city bus lines and six night bus lines, as well as several taxi companies.

The [[Trams in Augsburg|Augsburg tramway network]] is now 35.5&nbsp;km-long after the opening of new lines to the [[University of Augsburg|university]] in 1996, the northern city boundary in 2001 and to the Klinikum Augsburg (Augsburg hospital) in 2002. Tram line 6, which runs 5.2&nbsp;km from Friedberg West to Hauptbahnhof (Central Station), opened in December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/urban-rail-news-in-brief-10.html |access-date=2 January 2011 |title=Railway Gazette: Urban rail news in brief |archive-date=1 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101050320/http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/urban-rail-news-in-brief-10.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In December 2021, tram line 3 was extended southward to the neighboring city of [[Königsbrunn]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.avv-augsburg.de/presse/neuigkeiten/details/koenigsbrunn-macht-mobil-neue-avv-stadtbuslinien-und-verlaengerte-strassenbahnli-nie-3 |access-date=11 September 2024 |title=Königsbrunn macht mobil: Neue AVV-Stadtbuslinien und verlängerte Straßenbahnlinie 3 |date=13 December 2021 }}</ref>

====Intercity bus====
There is one station for [[intercity bus service]]s in Augsburg: Augsburg Nord, located in the north of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/augsburg |title=Augsburg: Stations |publisher=Travelinho.com |access-date=2 December 2017 |archive-date=4 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804194128/https://www.travelinho.com/en/travel/augsburg |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Railway===
[[File:Bahnhofsgebäude Augsburg.JPG|thumb|The front of the station]]
Augsburg has seven stations, the [[Augsburg Central Station|Central Station]] (''Hauptbahnhof''), [[Augsburg-Hochzoll station|Hochzoll]], [[Augsburg-Oberhausen station|Oberhausen]], [[Augsburg Haunstetterstraße station|Haunstetterstraße]], [[Augsburg Morellstraße station|Morellstraße]], [[Augsburg Messe station|Messe]] and [[Augsburg-Inningen|Inningen]]. The Central Station, built from 1843 to 1846, is Germany's oldest main station in a large city still providing services in the original building. It is currently being modernised and an underground tram station is built underneath it. [[Augsburg Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]] is on the [[Munich–Augsburg railway|Munich–Augsburg]] and [[Ulm–Augsburg railway|Ulm–Augsburg lines]] and is connected by [[InterCityExpress|ICE]] and [[InterCity|IC]] services to [[Munich]], [[Berlin]], [[Dortmund]], [[Frankfurt]], [[Hamburg]] and [[Stuttgart]]. As of December 2007, the French [[TGV]] connected Augsburg with a direct High Speed Connection to [[Paris]]. In addition [[EuroCity|EC]] and night train services connect to [[Amsterdam]], [[Paris]] and [[Vienna]] and connections will be substantially improved by the creation of the planned [[Magistrale for Europe]].

The AVV operates seven [[Regionalbahn]] lines from the main station to:
*[[Mammendorf]]
*[[Schmiechen]] (direction to [[Ammersee]])
*[[Aichach]]/[[Kühbach|Radersdorf]]
*[[Meitingen]]/[[Donauwörth]]
*[[Dinkelscherben]]
*[[Schwabmünchen]]
*[[Klosterlechfeld]]
Starting in 2008, the regional services are planned to be altered to [[S-Bahn]] frequencies and developed long term as integrated into the Augsburg S-Bahn.

===Air transport===
Until 2005 Augsburg was served by nearby [[Augsburg Airport]] (AGB). In that year all air passenger transport was relocated to [[Munich Airport]]. Since then, the airport is used almost entirely by business airplanes.<ref name="flughafen-augsburg">{{cite web |url=http://www.flughafen-augsburg.de/en/augsburg-airport/flughafen-augsburg-edma/ |publisher=flughafen-augsburg.de |title=Augsburg Airport (EDMA) |access-date=24 February 2017 |archive-date=1 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401212446/http://www.flughafen-augsburg.de/en/augsburg-airport/flughafen-augsburg-edma/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Erzengel-Michael-Augsburg-1.jpg|thumb|Statue of [[Archangel Michael]] in Augsburg]]
[[File:Industrial robots-transparent.gif|thumb|KUKA's industrial robots]]

Augsburg is a vibrant industrial city. Many global market leaders namely [[MAN SE|MAN]], [[EADS]] or [[KUKA]] produce high technology products like printing systems, large diesel engines, [[industrial robots]] or components for the [[Airbus A380]] and the [[Ariane (rocket family)|Ariane]] carrier rocket. After [[Munich]], Augsburg is considered the high-tech centre for [[Information and communications technology|Information and Communication]] in Bavaria and takes advantage of its lower [[operating cost]]s, yet close proximity to Munich and potential customers. In 2018 the Bavarian State Government recognised this fact and promoted Augsburg to ''Metropole''.<ref name="metropole">{{cite web |url=https://www.landesentwicklung-bayern.de/fileadmin/user_upload/landesentwicklung/Dokumente_und_Cover/Instrumente/LEP_Beteiligungsverfahren_Feb_2017/LEP-Teilfortschreibung-2017/LEP_Teilfortschreibung_Feb_2018/180220_Verordnung.pdf |publisher=Bayerisches Staatsministerium der Finanzen, für Landesentwicklung und Heimat |title=Verordnung zur Änderung der Verordnung über das Landesentwicklungsprogramm Bayern |date=21 February 2018 |access-date=18 July 2018 |archive-date=18 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718115020/https://www.landesentwicklung-bayern.de/fileadmin/user_upload/landesentwicklung/Dokumente_und_Cover/Instrumente/LEP_Beteiligungsverfahren_Feb_2017/LEP-Teilfortschreibung-2017/LEP_Teilfortschreibung_Feb_2018/180220_Verordnung.pdf |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Sports==
[[File:Borussia dortmund augsburg.jpg|right|thumb|FC Augsburg against [[Borussia Dortmund]] in the Bundesliga at the [[Augsburg Arena|SGL arena]] in November 2012]]
[[FC Augsburg]] is a football team based in Augsburg and plays in the [[Augsburg Arena|WWK ARENA]] to the south of the city centre. FC Augsburg secured promotion to [[Bundesliga]] in 2011 and have remained there ever since, qualifying for the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] for the first time in 2015 and securing mid-table finishes across the last few seasons. The club, nicknamed the Fuggerstädter or simply as FCA, reached the last 32 in the [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League|2015–16 Europa League]] with a 1–0 aggregate defeat to [[Liverpool]]. The WWK ARENA, nicknamed the "Anfield of the B17 Highway" following the Liverpool UEL match, opened in July 2009 and also hosted games of the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup]]. The 30,660 capacity arena is easily accessible from the city centre or the adjacent B17 dual carriageway.

The city is home to a [[Deutsche Eishockey Liga|DEL]] (first-division) ice hockey team, the [[Augsburger Panther]]. The original club, AEV, was formed in 1878, the oldest German ice sport club and regularly draws around 4,000 spectators, quite reasonable for German ice hockey. Home games are played at the [[Curt Frenzel Stadium|Curt Frenzel Stadion]]: a recently rebuilt (2012–2013) indoor rink and modern stadium and the club reached the 2018/19 DEL semi finals, eventually losing in the winner-takes-all game 7 to EHC Red Bull München (4–3 series defeat). Consequently, the Panthers qualified for the [[Champions Hockey League]]. Augsburg is also home to one of the most traditional German Baseball clubs, the Augsburg Gators and 2 American Football Clubs, the Raptors and Augsburg Storm, and in nearby [[Königsbrunn]] there is the Königsbrunn Ants.

For the [[1972 Summer Olympics|1972 Olympic Games]] in [[Munich]], a protective diversion channel of the [[Lech (river)|Lech]] dam for river ice was transformed into the world's first [[artificial whitewater]] slalom course: the [[Augsburg Eiskanal|Eiskanal]], which remains a world-class competition venue and has served as a prototype for two dozen similar courses abroad.

==Local city nicknames==
While commonly called ''Fuggerstadt'' (Fuggers' city) due to the [[Fugger family|Fuggers]] residing there, within Swabia it is also often referred to as ''Datschiburg'': which originated sometime in the 19th century refers to Augsburg's favorite sweet: the ''Datschi'' made from fruit, preferably prunes, and thin cake dough.<ref>[http://www.stadtlexikon-augsburg.de/index.php?id=114&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3518&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=123&cHash=8ef071d563 Augsburger Stadtlexikon – ''Datschiburg''] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085653/http://www.stadtlexikon-augsburg.de/index.php?id=114&tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=3518&tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=123&cHash=8ef071d563 |date=19 July 2011 }} {{in lang|de}} accessed: 18 November 2008</ref> The ''Datschiburger Kickers'' charity football team (founded in 1965) reflects this in its choice of team name.<ref>[http://www.datschiburger-kickers.de/aktuelles/aktuelles_index.html ''Datschiburger Kickers'' website] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091006025126/http://www.datschiburger-kickers.de/aktuelles/aktuelles_index.html |date=6 October 2009 }} accessed: 18 November 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.stadtlexikon-augsburg.de/index.php?id=115&no_cache=1 Augsburger Stadtlexikon – ''Datschiburger Kickers''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719085759/http://www.stadtlexikon-augsburg.de/index.php?id=115&no_cache=1 |date=19 July 2011 }} {{in lang|de}} accessed: 18 November 2008</ref>

Among younger people, the city is commonly called "Aux" for short. {{citation needed|date=January 2013}}
