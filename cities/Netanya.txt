'''Netanya''' (also '''Natanya''', {{langx|he|נְתַנְיָה}}) is a city in the Northern [[Central District (Israel)|Central District]] of Israel, and is the capital of the surrounding [[Sharon plain]]. It is {{cvt|30|km|1}} north of [[Tel Aviv]], and {{cvt|56|km|1}} south of [[Haifa]], between the [[Poleg]] stream and the [[Wingate Institute]] in the south and the Avihayil stream in the north. Some of its expansion and suburbs are located on the land of the depopulated village of [[Umm Khaled]].

Netanya was named in honor of [[Nathan Straus]], a prominent [[American Jews|Jewish American]] merchant and philanthropist in the early 20th century who was the co-owner of [[Macy's]] [[department store]]. The city's {{cvt|14|km|mi}} of beaches have made the city a [[Tourism in Israel|popular tourist resort]]. 

In {{Israel populations|Year}}, Netanya had a population of {{Israel populations|Netanya}},{{Israel populations|reference}} making it the 7th-largest city in Israel by population. An additional 150,000 people live in the local and regional councils within {{cvt|10|km|0|abbr=off}} of Netanya, which serves as a regional center for them. The city mayor is [[Miriam Feirberg]].

==History==

Before the 20th century, parts of Netanya belonged to the Forest of [[Sharon plain|Sharon]], a hallmark of the region's historical landscape. It was an open [[woodland]] dominated by Mount Tabor Oak ([[Quercus ithaburensis]]), which extended from [[Kfar Yona]] in the north to [[Ra'anana]] in the south. Arabs who lived in the area used it for [[pasture]], [[firewood]] and intermittent [[Agriculture|cultivation]]. The intensification of settlement and agriculture in the [[Israeli coastal plain|coastal plain]] during the 19th century led to [[deforestation]] and subsequent [[environmental degradation]] known from [[Hebrew literature|Hebrew sources]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Marom |first=Roy |date=2022-12-01 |title=יער‬ ‫השרון (אל-ע'אבה) בתקופה העות'מאנית:‬ ‫בתקופה‬ ‫מהמחקר‬ ‫חדשות‬ ‫תובנות‬ ‫הגיאוגרפי-היסטורי The Oak Forest of the Sharon (al-Ghaba) in the Ottoman Period: New Insights from Historical- Geographical Studies |url=https://www.academia.edu/93207554 |journal=Muse |volume=5 |pages=90–107}}</ref>

The funds for the project of building Netanya were raised by [[Itamar Ben-Avi]] and [[Oved Ben-Ami]], who embarked on a fundraising trip to the United States to raise the money. In 1928 members of Bnei Binyamin and Hanotea, an organisation set up after Straus was informed of the establishment of the settlement, purchased {{cvt|350|acre|km2}} of [[Umm Khaled]] lands.<ref name="history" /> On December 14, 1928, a team led by Moshe Shaked began digging for water at the site. After water was discovered in February 1929, the first five settlers moved onto the land. In the weeks that followed, more settlers began arriving. Development was set back due to the [[1929 Palestine riots]] and massacre of Jews. By September, however, development was back on track with the cornerstones for the first 10 houses being laid on [[Sukkot]].<ref name="history"/>

The first kindergarten opened in 1930 and the first school in 1931. In the [[1931 census of Palestine]], Netanya was recorded as having 253 residents. In 1933, the British architect [[Clifford Holliday]] drew up a plan for Netanya as a tourist resort. Holliday also designed urban projects in Jaffa, [[Tiberias]], Lydda and Ramla.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-zk7q25Nw4kC&q=clifford%20holliday%20netanya&pg=PA17 |title=The Jewish-Arab city: spatio-politics in a mixed community. |author=Yacobi Haim |year=2009 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-0-203-87969-6 |access-date=October 25, 2020 |archive-date=March 27, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220327060753/https://books.google.com/books?id=-zk7q25Nw4kC&q=clifford+holliday+netanya&pg=PA17 |url-status=live }}</ref> The first [[Urban planning|urban plan]] divided the city into three sections with a tourism district along the coastline, housing, farms and commerce in the center, and agriculture and industry to the east.

In 1934,  the first [[Aliyah Bet]] ship brought 350 immigrants to Netanya's shoreline, followed by more than seventeen more ships by 1939. In 1934, the Primazon factory opened there, producing fruit and vegetable preserves. An industrial zone was established, and the first synagogue and school was built.<ref name="history"/>

In 1937 the cornerstone was laid for a new commercial center and the connection of Netanya to the Tel Aviv-Haifa road. In 1939, the Ophir diamond polishing plant, the first diamond polishing plant in Palestine, was opened by Asher Daskall and Zvi Rosenberg.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://en.israelidiamond.co.il/wikidiamond/diamond-industry-figures/oved-ben-ami/ |title=Oved Ben Ami – was awarded the title of Diamond Industry Dignitary |website=Israeli Diamond |access-date=August 19, 2020 |archive-date=December 5, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201205090730/https://en.israelidiamond.co.il/wikidiamond/diamond-industry-figures/oved-ben-ami/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://en.israelidiamond.co.il/history-diamond-industry-30s/ |title=The 30s At The Israeli Diamond Industry |website=Israeli Diamond |access-date=August 19, 2020 |archive-date=August 8, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808095710/https://en.israelidiamond.co.il/history-diamond-industry-30s/ |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1940, the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] government defined Netanya as a [[Local council (Israel)|local council]] of which [[Oved Ben-Ami]] was elected head.<ref name="history"/> In 1944, Netanya had a population of 4,900.

During the [[Jewish insurgency in Palestine]], the Jewish underground group [[Irgun]] launched several attacks against British military and police forces in the Netanya area. The town itself was a bastion of support for the Irgun. The most infamous incident happened in July 1947, in what became known as the [[The Sergeants affair|Sergeants affair]]. After three Irgun fighters had been sentenced to death by the British, the Irgun abducted two British sergeants on a Netanya street, and hid them in an abandoned factory. The British responded by declaring martial law and placing Netanya and the surrounding area under curfew. The British Army searched the town and interrogated residents, but did not find the sergeants. After the three Irgun fighters were hanged, the Irgun hanged the two sergeants in the factory and re-hanged and booby-trapped their bodies in an orange grove.<ref>Bell, Bowyer J.: ''Terror out of Zion'' (1976)</ref>

In November 1947, an [[Egged Bus Cooperative|Egged]] bus driving from Netanya to Jerusalem was [[Fajja bus attacks|attacked]] in [[Petah Tikva]]. In 1948, following the withdrawal of British forces from Netanya and the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War|1948 Arab-Israeli War]], a large military base was established in the city.

On December 3, 1948, Netanya was declared a city in the newly established State of Israel.<ref name="history" />  Ramat Tiomkin, Ein Hatchlelet, Pardes Hagdud, and Ramat Ephraim were annexed to Netanya. At this time, Netanya had a population of 11,600.<ref name="spatial" />

During the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, Netanya was hit by Jordanian artillery, and Jordanian planes made sorties near Netanya, but failed to cause major damage. A lone Iraqi bomber attacked Netanya, dropping several bombs which damaged a factory and caused some casualties, shortly before being shot down.

==Economy==
[[File:קניון נעימי-1, נתניה.jpg|thumb|250px|Naimi Shopping Mall]]
Industry in Netanya is largely divided between two industrial parks.{{cn|date=October 2024}} In the south of the city, the newest of these, Pinchas Sapir (KA Poleg), houses the first branch of [[IKEA]] in Israel as well as technology companies such as [[Ceedo]].{{cn|date=October 2024}} Tourism also plays a major part in Netanya's economy with some 19 hotels in the city having 1,452 rooms.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

==Geography==
Netanya is located on the [[Israeli Coastal Plain|Israeli Mediterranean Coastal Plain]], the [[Via Maris|historic land bridge]] between Europe, Africa, and Asia. The city is the capital of the [[Sharon plain]], a geographic region stretching from the [[Mediterranean]] in the west to the Samarian hills in the east, and the modern-day [[Gush Dan|Tel Aviv metropolitan area]] in the south northwards to [[Mount Carmel]]. Although the capital of a densely populated region, Netanya itself is relatively separate from settlements to the north, south, and east, although, over time, growth has incorporated some into what makes up modern-day Netanya.
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 19345 Iris nature reserve in Netanya.JPG|thumb|left|Iris nature reserve]]
Apart from some small [[moshav]]im and [[kibbutz]]im, south of Netanya is relatively clear of settlement until [[Herzliya]] and the start of the [[Gush Dan]], Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area. Likewise, to the north is clear of large settlement until [[Hadera]], and to the east until [[Tulkarm]] in the [[West Bank]]. The area to the east of Netanya does, however, have a large concentration of kibbutzim and moshavim in the [[Hefer Valley Regional Council]] and [[Local council (Israel)|local councils]] of [[Kfar Yona]], [[Kadima-Zoran]] and [[Even Yehuda]].

Netanya itself is divided into a large number of neighborhoods (see [[Neighborhoods of Netanya]]), recently growing southwards out of the city to create several high-end coastal neighborhoods with industrial areas inland. Netanya is home to the Poleg nature reserve and the Irises Dora Rainpool nature park containing the world's largest population of [[iris atropurpurea]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Saving Israel's Coastal Iris |first=Christi |last=Yoder |date=10 June 2015 |url=http://blog.enketo.org/coastal-iris/ |publisher=blog.enketo.org |access-date=26 April 2016 |archive-date=May 10, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160510101355/http://blog.enketo.org/coastal-iris/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=The Irises Dora Rainpool nature park |url=http://www.flowersinisrael.com/fieldtrip2012_1_26_DoraRainPool.htm |publisher=flowersinisrael.com |access-date=1 May 2016 |archive-date=April 13, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413163310/http://flowersinisrael.com/fieldtrip2012_1_26_DoraRainPool.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> At the center of the park is a rainpool which fills up with water in the winter months, and dries up over the summer months.
