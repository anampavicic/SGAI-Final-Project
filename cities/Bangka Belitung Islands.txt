The '''Bangka Belitung Islands''' ({{langx|id|Kepulauan Bangka Belitung}}; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: {{Script/Arabic|كڤولاوان بڠک بليتوڠ}}) is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Indonesia]]. Situated off the southeastern coast of [[Sumatra]], the province comprises two main land masses — the islands of [[Bangka Island|Bangka]] and [[Belitung]] — and numerous smaller islands. Bangka Belitung is bordered by the [[Bangka Strait]] to the west, the [[Natuna Sea]] to the north, the [[Java Sea]] is to the south and the [[Karimata Strait]] to the east; the two principal islands are separated by the [[Gaspar Strait]], within which lie lesser islands such as [[Lepar Island|Lepar]], [[Pongok Island|Pongok]] (or Liak) and [[Mendanau Island|Mendanau]].

The province's capital and largest city is [[Pangkal Pinang|Pangkalpinang]]. The province shares maritime borders with [[South Sumatra]] to the west, [[Riau Islands]] to the north, [[Banten]], the [[Special Capital Region of Jakarta]], [[West Java]], and [[Central Java]] to the south, and [[West Kalimantan]] to the east. Bangka Belitung covers a land area of {{cvt|16,690.13|km2}} and had a population of 1,455,678 according to the [[2020 Indonesian census|2020 census]];<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,511,899 (comprising 776,607 males and 735,292 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Kepulauan Bangka Belitung Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.19)</ref>

Bangka Belitung has an [[equatorial climate]] with tropical [[rainforest]]s, which, however, are disappearing due to deforestation. Mount Maras, located on the island of Bangka, is the province's highest point, with a height of {{cvt|699|m}}. There are several rivers in the province, such as the Sebuku River, Baturusa River and Mendo River. Bangka Belitung is ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse; major ethnic groups including [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]]. [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is the official language, while the local [[Malay language|Malay dialect]] and [[Hakka language|Hakka]] serves as the [[lingua franca]] of the province.

Historically, Bangka Belitung has been part of the kingdoms of [[Sriwijaya]], [[Majapahit]] and [[Palembang Sultanate|Palembang]], before becoming a colony of foreign empires ([[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], [[British Empire|British]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]]). Bangka Belitung was a [[Residency (country subdivision)|residency]] within the [[Dutch East Indies]]. Upon the independence of Indonesia, the region was administered as part of the province of Sumatra and subsequently of [[South Sumatra]]. Bangka Belitung officially became the 31st province of Indonesia on 4 December 2000.

==Etymology==
The name "Bangka" is derived from the word ''wangka'' (वन्च, 'vanca') meaning "tin" in [[Sanskrit]], because this region is indeed rich in tin mining. The name "Wangka" first appeared along with the name "[[Suvarnabhumi|Swarnabhumi]]" in the Indian literary book Milindrapantha from the 1st Century BC. Swarnabhumi is identified as the island of [[Sumatra]], the strong allegation that the so-called "Wangka" is the island of Bangka. [[Louis-Charles Damais]], in his book ''Epigraphy and History of the Nusantara'', affirms that Bangka comes from the word vowel (vanca).

The name "Belitung" is derived from ''Billitonite'' meaning the Black Meteorite in Dutch, which is commonly found in the island of Belitung. This stone itself was discovered at the time of tin mining in Belitung. Later on, Dutch academics writing in East Indies publications began named the island ''Billitonite'' or Billiton. Nowadays, ''Billitonite'' or Black Meteorite, is a distinct souvenir from Belitung Island.

Bangka Belitung is an area that has a unique range of cultures and languages. Just like other provinces in Indonesia, Bangka Belitung were European and Japanese colonies. Prior to the colonial era, Bangka Belitung was part the [[Srivijaya|Sriwijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] kingdoms who settled Bangka Belitung to expand their power.

The first Europeans arrived in Bangka was the British on 20 May 1812. However, with the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]], the British left Bangka Belitung, and the Dutch took over. Due to the agreement, the Dutch were able to take control of the Pacific Islands. However, there was a coup attempt by local elite through Depati Barin and his son Depati Amir causing a war from 1849 to 1851 to oppose the colonization in Bangka Belitung, the war was won by the Dutch and Depati Amir was exiled to [[Kupang]] in [[East Nusa Tenggara]]. Depati Amir was memorialized as a national hero and his name was remembered through its regional airport, the [[Depati Amir Airport]].

During [[World War II|WWII]], the [[Empire of Japan]] briefly [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|occupied the region]]. Following the [[surrender of Japan]] and the end of the war, the islands become part of an [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|independent Indonesia]].

Bangka Belitung has a long history of Chinese in-migration, mainly [[Hakka people|Hakka]]. Chinese people in the 13th century had started to migrate into the Bangka region. In the 17th century, the rulers of Palembang saw there was extraordinary potential and later they founded tin mines in Belitung. The tin mine was the main reason the Dutch decided to bring contract workers from mainland China, resettling in Belitung. The tin helped drive the island's development and make it the place it is today. Since then, some of the Chinese migrants returned to china while others decided to stay. The ones who decided to stay began assimilating with local people and this was followed by intermarriages. They live peacefully in spite of differences in religion and ethnicity. When [[May 1998 riots of Indonesia|anti-Chinese riots]] occurred in some parts of Indonesia at the end of the [[Fall of Suharto|Suharto regime in 1998]], the locals and those of Chinese descent were not much concerned and still lived peacefully in the Bangka Belitung province.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/02/08/heaven-earth-bangka-belitung.html |title=Heaven on earth in Bangka Belitung |date=February 8, 2012}}</ref>

Bangka Island and Belitung Island were originally inhabited by the [[Orang Laut]], over the course of a long history formed by the process of culture and acculturation. The [[Orang Laut]] themselves came from various islands. Sea people from Belitung sailed and inhabited the coast along the [[Malay Peninsula]], then returned to Bangka Island and Belitung Island, while those who lived in the [[Riau Islands]] sailed to Bangka. There are also groups of Orang Laut from [[Sulawesi]] and [[Kalimantan]]. In the next wave, the [[Bugis people|Bugis]], who were originally from [[South Sulawesi]], came and settled in Bangka, Belitung and Riau. Then came the Johor Malay, Siantan Malay, Malay-Chinese, and also native Chinese, mingling during the process of acculturation and culture. Finally came the Minangkabau, Javanese, Banjarese, Madurese, Acehnese and some other ethnic groups.

The [[Malay (ethnic group)|Malay]] is the largest ethnic group in the province. They form around 52.5% of the total population. The Malays are mostly concentrated around the interior of Bangka and Belitung. The Malay are divided into the Bangka Malay and the Belitung Malay. These 2 group are slightly different ranging from their culture to their language. Most of the Malays works in either the farming industry or the fishing industry. The Malay in Bangka Belitung have a very distinct lifestyle compared to other Malay people, especially with those in [[Malaysia]].

The second largest ethnic group is the [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], forming around 29.1% of the total population. The Chinese are mostly concentrated in the coastal part of Bangka and Belitung or urban areas. The Chinese in Bangka Belitung were originally from [[Southern China]], especially from the [[Guangdong]] province, migrating from the 18th century to the early 20th century to have better job opportunities. During the colonial era, most of the Chinese worked in the mining industry as well as making their own businesses. Most of the Chinese in Bangka Belitung are [[Hakka people|Hakka]], while significant [[Hokkien people|Hokkien]] and [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] communities also exist. The Chinese culture in Bangka is slightly different from the Chinese in Belitung. The Chinese in Bangka were imported in the early 18th century when the mine was officially opened. They generally did not bring their wives and thus married indigenous people, so the Chinese in Bangka are mostly peranakans who speak the Hakka Language mixed with Malay. Belitung Chinese are considered "totok" ("full-blooded") because when they came in the 19th century they brought their wives. They adapted to the culture of the archipelago, among others, by changing their clothing into local clothing such as clothes with kebaya kurung or sarong. They still speak with the original Hakka language spoken in China today.

The rest of the population consist of immigrants from other parts of Indonesia such as the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and the [[Bugis]].
