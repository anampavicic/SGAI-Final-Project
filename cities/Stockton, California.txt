'''Stockton''' is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[San Joaquin County, California|San Joaquin County]] in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]].<ref name="GR6">{{cite web |url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |access-date=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archive-date=May 31, 2011 }}</ref> It is the most populous city in the county, the [[List of municipalities in California|11th-most populous city]] in California and the [[List of United States cities by population|60th-most populous city]] in the [[United States]]. Stockton's population in 2020 was 320,804. It was named an [[All-America City Award|All-America City]] in 1999, 2004, 2015, and again in 2017 and 2018. The city is located on the [[San Joaquin River]] in the northern [[San Joaquin Valley]]. It lies at the southeastern corner of a [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta|large inland river delta]] that isolates it from other nearby cities such as [[Sacramento]] and those of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

Stockton was founded by [[Charles Maria Weber]] in 1849 after he acquired [[Rancho Campo de los Franceses]]. The city is named after [[Robert F. Stockton]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/tf4x0nb3xb/entire_text/ |title=Register of the Stockton (Calif.) Public Documents, 1947-|website=Online Archive of California |access-date=June 27, 2018}}</ref> and it was the first community in California to have a name not of Spanish or Native American origin.

Built during the [[California Gold Rush]], Stockton's seaport serves as a gateway to the Central Valley and beyond. It provided easy access for trade and transportation to the southern gold mines. The [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]] (UOP), chartered in 1851, is the oldest university in California, and has been located in Stockton since 1923. In 2012, Stockton filed for what was then the largest municipal [[bankruptcy]] in US history{{snd}}which had multiple causes, including financial mismanagement in the 1990s, generous [[fringe benefits]] to unionized city employees,<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-stockton-bankruptcy-cause-idUSBRE8621DL20120703 |title=How Stockton went broke: A 15-year spending binge|date=July 3, 2012 |publisher=Reuters|access-date=November 16, 2019|language=en |last=Christie |first=Jim }}</ref> and the [[Great Recession|2008 financial crisis]]. Stockton successfully exited bankruptcy in February 2015.

==History==
[[File:Charles M. Weber.jpg|thumb|left|Carlos Maria Weber founded Stockton when he acquired and settled [[Rancho Campo de los Franceses]].]]
When Europeans first arrived in the Stockton area, it was occupied by the Yatchicumne, a branch of the Northern Valley [[Yokuts people|Yokuts Indians]]. They built their villages on low mounds to keep their homes above regular floods. A Yokuts village named Pasasimas was located on a mound between Edison and Harrison Streets on what is now the [[Stockton Channel]] in downtown Stockton.<ref name="historycity">{{cite web|title=History A Look into Stockton's Past Before the Gold Rush|url=http://www.stocktongov.com/discover/history/hist.html|publisher=City of Stockton|access-date=February 21, 2016}}</ref>

The [[Siskiyou Trail]] began in the northern [[San Joaquin Valley]]. It was a centuries-old Native American footpath that led through the [[Sacramento Valley]] over the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]] and into present-day [[Oregon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/592072|title=Archaeological Investigations of the Siskiyou Trail Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument Jackson County|access-date=July 16, 2016}}</ref>

The extensive network of waterways in and around Stockton was fished and navigated by [[Plains and Sierra Miwok|Miwok Indians]] for centuries. During the [[California Gold Rush]], the [[San Joaquin River]] was navigable by ocean-going vessels, making Stockton a natural inland seaport and point of supply and departure for prospective gold-miners. From the mid-19th century onward, Stockton became the region's transportation hub, dealing mainly with agricultural products.

====Mexican era====

Carlos Maria Weber was a German émigré in the United States in 1836. He was born as Carl David Weber (February 18, 1814, in [[Steinwenden]] – May 4, 1881, in Stockton) and then went by Charles in 1836 in the United States, first spending time in [[New Orleans]] and then in [[Texas]]. He then came overland from Missouri to California with the [[Bartleson-Bidwell Party]] in 1841 and began to go by Carlos, when he began working for [[John Sutter]]. In 1842 Weber settled in the [[Pueblo of San José]].

As an alien, Weber could not secure a land grant directly, so he formed a partnership with Guillermo (William) Gulnac. Born in New York, Gulnac had married a Mexican woman and sworn allegiance to [[Mexico]], which then ruled California. He applied in Weber's place for [[Rancho Campo de los Franceses]], a land grant of 11 square [[league (unit)|leagues]] on the east side of the San Joaquin River.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/GR_4157|title=A History of Stockton from Its Organization up to the Present Time | first=George Henry|last=Tinkham |year=1880|page=[https://archive.org/details/GR_4157/page/n430 397] |publisher=W.M. Hinton & Co.}}</ref>

Gulnac and Weber dissolved their partnership in 1843. Gulnac's attempts to settle the Rancho Campo de los Franceses failed, and Weber acquired it in 1845. In 1846 Weber had induced a number of settlers to locate on the rancho when the [[Mexican–American War]] broke out. Considered a Californio, Weber was offered the position of captain by Mexican general [[José Castro]], which he declined; he later, however, accepted the position of captain in the Cavalry of the United States. Captain Weber's decision to change sides lost him a great deal of the trust he had built up among his Mexican business partners. As a result, he moved to the grant in 1847 and sold his business in San Jose in 1849.

====Gold Rush era====

At the start of the [[California Gold Rush]] in 1848, Europeans and Americans started to arrive in the area of Weber's rancho on their way to the goldfields. When Weber decided to try his hand at gold mining in late 1848, he soon found selling supplies to [[California Gold Rush|gold-seekers]] was more profitable.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.stockton.ca.us/Awards/WeberAward.cfm |title=Captain Charles M.

As the head of navigation on the San Joaquin River, the city grew rapidly as a miners' supply point during the Gold Rush. Weber built the first permanent residence in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] on a piece of land now known as Weber Point.<ref name="historycity"/>  During the Gold Rush, the location of what is now Stockton developed as a river port, the hub of roads to the gold settlements in the San Joaquin Valley and northern terminus of the [[Stockton - Los Angeles Road]]. During its early years, Stockton was known by several names, including "Weberville," "Fat City," "Mudville" and "California's Sunrise Seaport."<ref name="uopabout">{{cite web|title=About Stockton|url=http://www.pacific.edu/About-Pacific/General-Questions/About-Stockton.html|website=www.pacific.edu|publisher=University of the Pacific|access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>  In 1849 Weber laid out a town, which he named "Tuleburg," but he soon decided on "Stockton" in honor of [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] [[Robert F. Stockton]]. Stockton was the first community in California to have a name that was neither Spanish nor [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] in origin.<ref name=facts>{{cite web|title=Stockton Facts|url=http://www.visitstockton.org/about-us/fun-facts/|publisher=Stockton Convention & Visitors Bureau|access-date=October 31, 2016}}</ref>

====Chinese immigration====

Thousands of Chinese came to Stockton from the [[Guangdong]] province of China during the 1850s due to a combination of political and economic unrest in China and the discovery of gold in California. After the gold rush, many worked for the railroads and land reclamation projects in the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]] and remained in Stockton. By 1880 Stockton was home to the third-largest Chinese community in California. Discriminatory laws, in particular the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]] of 1882, restricted immigration and prevented the Chinese from buying property.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/ugly-legacy-latino-couple-finds-racist-covenant-housing-paperwork-n1082476|title=An ugly legacy: Latino couple finds racist covenant in housing paperwork|last=Aviles|first=Gwen|date=November 15, 2019|work=NBC News|language=en|access-date=November 16, 2019|quote=No persons other than those wholly of the white Caucasian race shall use, occupy or reside upon any part of or within any building located on the above described real property, except servants or domestics of another race employed by or domiciled with a white Caucasian owner or tenant,}}</ref> The Lincoln Hotel, built in 1920 by the Wong brothers on South El Dorado Street, was considered one of Stockton's finest hotels of the time. Only after the [[Magnuson Act]] was repealed in 1962 were American-born Chinese allowed to buy property and own buildings.<ref>{{cite web|title=Spirit of Stockton's Chinatown|url=http://downtownstockton.org/stockton_history.php|publisher=Downtown Stockton Alliance|access-date=February 21, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202214924/http://downtownstockton.org/stockton_history.php|archive-date=February 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Some State of California and City of San Francisco Anti-Chinese Legislation and Subsequent Action|url=http://teachingresources.atlas.illinois.edu/chinese_exp/resources/resource_2_4.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107170704/http://teachingresources.atlas.illinois.edu/chinese_exp/resources/resource_2_4.pdf |archive-date=November 7, 2014 |url-status=live|publisher=The Board of Trustees of the University of Illinois|access-date=February 26, 2016|year=2006}}</ref>

====Incorporation====

The city was officially incorporated on July 23, 1850, by the county court, and the first city election was held on July 31, 1850. In 1851 the City of Stockton received its charter from the State of California. Early settlers included gold seekers from Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, the Pacific Islands, Mexico and Canada. The historical population diversity is reflected in Stockton street names, architecture, numerous ethnic festivals and the faces and heritage of a majority of its citizens. In 1870 the Census Bureau reported Stockton's population as 87.6% white and 10.7% Asian. Many Chinese were immigrating to California as workers in these years, especially for the [[Transcontinental Railroad]].<ref name="census">{{cite web|title=California - Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 }}</ref>

[[Benjamin Holt]] settled in Stockton in 1883 and with his three brothers founded the Stockton Wheel Co., and later the [[Holt Manufacturing Company]].

On April 22, 1918, British Army Col. [[Ernest Dunlop Swinton]] visited Stockton while on a tour of the United States. The British and French armies were using many hundreds of Holt tractors to haul heavy guns and supplies during [[World War I]], and Swinton publicly thanked Holt and his workforce for their contribution to the war effort.<ref>''Caterpillar Times'' report, May 1918, pages 5 to 8.</ref> During 1914 and 1915, Swinton had advocated basing some sort of armored fighting vehicle on Holt's caterpillar tractors, but without success (although Britain did develop tanks, they came from a separate source and were not directly derived from Holt machines).<ref>''Eyewitness, being Personal Reminiscences of Certain Phases of the Great War, Including the Genesis of the Tank,'' by Major-General Sir Ernest D.

On January 10, 1920, a major fire on Main Street threatened an entire city block. At about 2 a.m., a blaze was discovered in the basement of the Yost-Dohrmann store, which was gutted, and adjacent businesses were damaged by flames and water. Damage was estimated at $150,000.<ref>United Press, “Stockton Is Scene Of $150,000 Fire,” ''Riverside Daily Press'', Riverside, California, Saturday January 10, 1920, Volume XXXV, Number 9, page 1.</ref>

In 1933, the [[Port of Stockton|port]] was modernized, and the Stockton Deepwater Channel, which improved water passage to [[San Francisco Bay]], was deepened and completed.

During [[World War II]], the Stockton Assembly Center was built on the San Joaquin County Fairgrounds, a few blocks from what was then the city center. One of 15 temporary detention sites run by the [[War Relocation Authority|Wartime Civilian Control Administration]], the center held some 4,200 [[Internment of Japanese Americans|Japanese-Americans removed]] from their West Coast homes under [[Executive Order 9066]], while they waited for transfer to more permanent and isolated camps in the interior of the country. The center opened on May 10, 1942, and operated until October 17, when the majority of its population was sent to [[Rohwer War Relocation Center|Rohwer]], Arkansas. The former incarceration site was named a California Historical Landmark in 1980, and in 1984 a marker was erected at the entrance to the fairgrounds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia.densho.org/Stockton%20%28detention%20facility%29/ |title=Stockton (detention facility) |publisher=Densho Encyclopedia |access-date=August 8, 2014}}</ref>

In 1979, the development of a residential area in Stockton at a burial ground of the tribe unearthed two hundred [[Miwok]] remains. In an attempt to prevent the further desecration of the burial grounds, a descendant of the people initiated a legal case which became ''[[Wana the Bear v. Community Construction]]'' (1982). The decision ultimately sided with the development company, which was heavily criticized by Native Americans as a display of [[ethnocentrism]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Echo-Hawk |first=Walter |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/646788565 |title=In the Courts of the Conqueror : the 10 Worst Indian Law Cases Ever Decided. |date=2010 |publisher=Fulcrum |isbn=978-1-55591-788-3 |location=New York |oclc=646788565}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/817236389 |title=The future of the past : archaeologists, Native Americans, and repatriation |date=2001 |publisher=Garland Pub |others=Tamara L.

In September 1996, the [[Base Realignment and Closure|Base Realignment and Closure Commission]] announced the final closure of Stockton's Naval Reserve Center on Rough and Ready Island.

==Geography==

Stockton is situated amidst the [[Arable land|farmland]] of California's [[San Joaquin Valley]], a subregion of the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]]. In and around Stockton are thousands of miles of [[waterways]] that make up the [[California Delta]].

[[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]], inland California's major north–south highways, pass through the city. [[California State Route 4|State Route 4]] and the dredged [[San Joaquin River]] connect the city with the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] to its west, creating the [[Stockton Deepwater Shipping Channel]]. Stockton and [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] are California's only [[Inland port|inland sea ports]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city occupies a total area of {{convert|64.8|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|61.7|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|3.1|sqmi}}, comprising 4.76%, is water.

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2009}}
[[File:Commercial & Savings Bank - Stockton, CA.jpg|thumb|The historic Commercial & Savings Bank building, Stockton]]

Historically an agricultural community, Stockton's economy has since diversified into other industries, which include telecommunications and [[manufacturing]].

Stockton's central location, relative to San Francisco and [[Sacramento]], its proximity to the state and interstate freeway system, and its comparatively inexpensive land costs have prompted several companies to base their regional operations in the city.

===Shopping===
The city of Stockton has one [[shopping mall]], the [[Weberstown Mall]]. The city previously housed the [[Sherwood Mall]], adjacent to Weberstown, but in 2022, it was converted into a shopping center now named Sherwood Place. It has the only Dillard's in the Northern California region at the Weberstown Mall, as well as one of the three Sears stores still operating in the Northern California region.

===Construction and public spending===
[[File:Kluft-photo-Stockton-Metro-Airport-July-2009-Img 0085c.jpg|thumb|View across [[Stockton Metropolitan Airport]], 2009]]

Beginning in the late 1990s, Stockton had commenced some revitalization projects.<ref>{{cite journal |last=McGrath |first=M. |date=2016 |title=Stockton, California: A My Brother's Keeper Community |journal=National Civic Review |volume=105 |issue=1 |pages=36–43 |doi=10.1002/ncr.21261|doi-access=free }}</ref>

===Real estate bubble===
[[File:StocktonCalifornia_2012.jpg|thumb|Stockton 2012 aerial view]]

The Stockton real estate market was disproportionately affected by the [[2007 subprime mortgage financial crisis]], and the city led the United States in [[foreclosure]]s for that year, with one of every 30 homes posted for foreclosure.<ref name="Christie">{{cite news|first=Les |last=Christie |url=https://money.cnn.com/2007/08/14/real_estate/California_cities_lead_foreclosure/index.htm |title=California cities fill top 10 foreclosure list |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=August 14, 2007 |access-date=February 4, 2010}}</ref> From September 2006 to September 2007, the value of a median-priced house in Stockton declined by 44%.<ref name="money.cnn.com">{{cite news|first=Les |last=Christie |url=https://money.cnn.com/2008/12/02/real_estate/REOs_tough_on_sellers/index.htm |title=Home sellers suffer amid wave of foreclosures |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=December 2, 2008 |access-date=February 26, 2010}}</ref>

Stockton's [[Weston Ranch]] neighborhood, a subdivision of modest tract homes built in the mid-1990s, had the worst foreclosure rate in the area according to [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now|ACORN]], a now-defunct national advocacy group for low and moderate-income families.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Stockton found itself squarely at the center of the 2000s' speculative [[housing bubble]]. Real estate in Stockton more than tripled in value between 1998 and 2005, but when the bubble burst in 2007, the ensuing financial crisis made Stockton one of the hardest-hit cities in United States.<ref name="America's Most Dangerous Cities">{{Cite journal| url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/04/23/most-dangerous-cities-lifestyle-real-estate-dangerous-american-cities_slide_12.html| title=America's Most Dangerous Cities| journal=Forbes| date=April 23, 2009| access-date=February 4, 2010}}</ref>

Stockton housing prices fell 39% in the 2008 fiscal year, and the city had the country's highest [[foreclosure]] rate (9.5%) as well. Stockton also had an unemployment rate of 13.3% in 2008, one of the highest in the United States. Stockton was rated by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2009 as America's fifth most dangerous city because of its [[crime rate]].<ref name="America's Most Dangerous Cities"/> In 2010, mainly due to the aforementioned factors, ''Forbes'' named it one of the three worst places to live in the United States.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,589887,00.html |publisher=Fox News | title=Forbes Magazine Names Worst Places to Live in America | date=March 24, 2010 | access-date=June 5, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531224243/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,589887,00.html | archive-date=May 31, 2010 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===City bankruptcy===
Following the 2008 financial crisis, in June 2012 Stockton became the largest city in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy protection. It was surpassed by [[Detroit bankruptcy|Detroit]] in July 2013. The city approved a plan to exit bankruptcy in October 2013,<ref name="Smith">{{cite web |url=http://www.recordnet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20131004/A_NEWS/310040326 |title=Council approves Chap. 9 exit plan |first=Scott |last=Smith |date=October 4, 2013 |access-date=November 6, 2013 |work=[[The Record (Stockton)|The Record]]}}</ref> and voters approved a sales tax on November 5, 2013, to help fund the exit.<ref name="Marcum">{{cite web |url=https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-stockton-tax-measure-election-20131106,0,5437212.story#axzz2jt4QaQcs |title=Stockton voters approve of new tax measure for bankrupt city | first=Diana | last=Marcum |date=November 6, 2013 |access-date=November 6, 2013 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] }}</ref>

The collapse in real estate valuations had a negative effect on the city's revenue base. On June 28, 2012, Stockton filed for [[Chapter 9, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 9 bankruptcy]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Stockton, California Chapter 9 Voluntary Petition|url=https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/7DR4LZQ/City_of_Stockton_California__caebke-12-32118__0001.0.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810225126/https://www.pacermonitor.com/view/7DR4LZQ/City_of_Stockton_California__caebke-12-32118__0001.0.pdf |archive-date=August 10, 2016 |url-status=live|website=PacerMonitor|access-date=June 22, 2016}}</ref> On April 1, 2013, the [[United States Bankruptcy Court]] Eastern District of California ruled that Stockton was eligible for bankruptcy protection.

The Stockton bankruptcy case lasted longer than two years and received nationwide attention. On October 4, 2013, Stockton City Council approved a bankruptcy exit plan by a 6–0 vote<ref name="Smith" /> to be filed with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Eastern District of California, Sacramento. Voters approved a {{frac|3|4}}-cent sales tax on November 5, 2013, to help fund the bankruptcy exit.<ref name="Marcum" />

On October 30, 2014, a [[federal bankruptcy judge]] approved the city's bankruptcy recovery plan, thus allowing the city to continue with the planned pension payments to retired workers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lifsher|first1=Marc|last2=Petersen|first2=Melody|title=Judge approves Stockton bankruptcy plan; worker pensions safe|url=https://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-stockton-pension-court-ruling-cuts-20141029-story.html|access-date=October 30, 2014|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=October 30, 2014}}</ref> The city exited from Chapter 9 bankruptcy on February 25, 2015.

==Climate==

[[File:Wpdms usgs photo sacramento delta 2.jpg|thumb|Stockton in relation to the [[Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta]]]]

Stockton's climate lies right on the boundary of, and fluctuates between, [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate|hot-summer Mediterranean]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') and [[Cold semi-arid climate|cool semi-arid]] (''BSk''). Stockton is characterized by very hot, arid summer and cool, wet winter.
