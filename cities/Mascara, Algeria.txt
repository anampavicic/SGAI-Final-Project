'''Mascara''' ({{Langx|ar|معسكر|translit=Muʿaskar}}) also spelled Maskara, is the capital city of [[Mascara Province]]. It has 150,000 inhabitants (2008 estimate). It was founded in the 10th century by the [[Banu Ifran]], a Berber tribe, and was the capital city of [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri|Emir Abd al-Qadir]], a leader of the Algerian resistance to early French colonial rule in the 19th century.

Mascara is an administrative, commercial and a market centre. Its trade is mostly centered on leather goods, grains, and olive oil, but it is especially famous for its good wine. It has good road and rail connections with other urban centres of Algeria. [[Relizane]] is {{convert|65|km|0|abbr=off}} northeast, [[Sidi Bel Abbes]] {{convert|90|km|0|abbr=on}} southwest, [[Oran]] 105 kkm northwest and [[Saïda, Algeria|Saïda]] {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}} south.

Mascara has two parts, a newer [[France|French]] area, and an older [[Muslim]] one. Large parts of the town lie inside the ruins of its ancient [[Defensive wall|rampart]]s. The city is the home of [[Lakhdar Belloumi]], a former Algerian [[association football|football]] (soccer) star.

==Etymology==
The word ''mascara'' is a [[Francisation]] of the Arabic word ''معسكر'' (mu'askar), meaning 'camp'. French colonization caused the city's name to be adopted in the French version as an official name. The name "[[mascara]]" was likely given in reference to the city that bears the same name, since in the mid-19th century the [[France|French]] discovered antimony powder during their conquest in the old town of [[Mascara, Algeria|Mascara]] in [[Algeria]]. The [[nomadic]] [[tribes]] used the [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] as a beauty product but also to protect themselves from various [[trachoma|trachomas]] and [[eye diseases]].
