'''Santa Cruz''', officially the '''Municipality of Santa Cruz''' ({{lang-ceb|Lungsod sa Santa Cruz}}; {{lang-tl|Bayan ng Santa Cruz}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Davao del Sur]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 101,125 people.{{PH census|current}}

The Municipality of Santa Cruz is part of [[Metro Davao|Metropolitan Davao]] as it shares borders with [[Davao City]].

== History ==
{{Moresources|section|date=June 2023}}
Santa Cruz is the oldest municipality in the province; it was founded on October 5, 1884, thirty-six years after the foundation of [[Davao City|Davao]], which is its mother city, by Don José
Uyanguren of [[Guipúzcoa]], [[Spain]]. [[Spanish people|Spanish]] pioneers and missionaries attempted to settle and [[Christianity|Christianize]] the area in what is now [[Barangay]] Poblacion as early as 1880. Due to the staunch [[Islamic]] faith of the local people, the enraged pioneers and missionaries planted a cross under a shelter to mark the failure of the missionaries to convert these people to Christianity; the town's name now bears the name of the cross planted by those Spaniards. Over the following years, many locals submitted to Christianity {{cn|date=June 2023}} and were conquered by Angel Rodriguez, the Spanish Governor-General of Davao.{{cn|date=June 2023}} Like [[Davao City#Establishment of the town|Don Uyanguren's attempt to develop the newly established Davao]], the area did not prosper for another two decades.

The [[American people|Americans]] arrived in Davao in the early 1900s after the Spanish defeat in the [[Spanish–American War]]. Fourteen years later, the town began to grow economically, although overshadowed by the booming economic growth of its neighbour [[Davao City|Davao]]. 

On March 16, 1936, its mother town, [[Davao City|Davao]], became one of the first two cities in Mindanao, the other being [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]], due to the town's faster economic growth and agricultural boom.

In 1942, it was the beginning of [[Philippines campaign (1941–1942)|Japanese invasion of the Philippines]]. The town suffered greatly during the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, unlike its neighbor Davao, which fared well and continued its economic growth during that time. The local recognized guerrillas and the military troops of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] units continued to attack the Imperial Japanese forces. In 1945, combined Filipino and American troops including recognized guerrillas fought the Japanese and [[Philippines Campaign (1944–1945)|liberated]] the town. The general headquarters of the [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] and [[Philippine Constabulary]] was active from 1945 to 1946 and was located in the town. After the war, most of the inhabitants of Santa Cruz moved to Davao in search of economic opportunities; despite this, the town continued its population and economic growth, though at a slower rate.

Almost three years after the Philippine Independence on July 4, 1946, two towns broke off from the municipality, namely: [[Padada]], on July 15, 1949; and [[Digos]] on July 19 in the same year. In the 1960s, a new municipality, ''Roxas'', was carved out from the town, covering the present-day barangays of Inauayan, Darong, Astorga, Coronon, and Sibulan; however, the Supreme Court of the Philippines nullified the creation of the municipality since this meant the collapse of the jurisdiction of once the most Christianized town in Mindanao.<ref>{{cite web | author = Antonio Figueroa | title = FAST BACKWARD: The dissolution of Roxas town | date = February 18, 2017 | publisher=Edge Davao| url=https://edgedavao.net/vantage-points/2017/02/19/fast-backward-dissolution-roxas-town/ | access-date = February 19, 2017}}</ref>

One of the municipalities which broke off from the town, Digos, became the capital town of the newly created [[Davao del Sur]] province in 1967; thirty-three years later it would become a city and will be the most populous in the entire province, excluding Davao City.

===Aspiration for cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On October 5, 2013, during the town's 129th anniversary of its existence, its local government leaders and populace have envisioned for a new aspiration for the town to become a city, given the presence of large industrial companies like the [[San Miguel Corporation]], Coco Davao Inc., Franklin Baker Co., GSL Food Industries in the town. The municipal mayor Joel Ray Lopez commented, "As the oldest town in the province of Davao del Sur, we really wanted it to become a city soon."<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.edgedavao.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12864:sta-cruz-aspires-cityhood-after-turning-129-years-old&catid=68:the-big-news&Itemid=96 | title=Edge Davao }}</ref> 

Its infrastructure have been moderately improved, and most of its cityhood requirements, specifically its income and total land area requirements, have been already met. When the municipality of Santa Cruz finally becomes a city, full industrialization in the area may be expected.

== Geography ==
Santa Cruz situates in the Northern part of Davao del Sur. Bounded by Davao City on the north and south by the city of Digos. After undergoing several political subdivisions, 27,960 hectares of land was left representing 6.7% of the total land area of Davao del Sur. Forest land comprises 60% and the rest includes the 8 coastal [[barangay]]s in the area.

The land area of Santa Cruz per Board of Technical Survey and Maps is 27,960 hectares. However, based on the Field Appraisal and Assessment Sheets (FAAS) and Tax Maps of the Municipal Assessor's Office the total land area of the municipality is 28,759.7855 or about 7.31% of the province's area (393,401 hectares). This excludes the Kapatagan contested area. Among the 18 barangays, Sibulan has the biggest land area of 6,390.6581 hectares or 22.22% of the total land area. Poblacion Zone III has the smallest area of 105.3148, only 0.37% of the total.

===Topography===
Santa Cruz is traversed by mountain ranges and high relief that include part of [[Mount Apo]], the highest mountain peak in the Philippines, straddle the south, central, north and north-western portions of the municipality. The rugged topography of the central area gradually undulates toward the coastal plains of the north-eastern, eastern and south-eastern parts. Here, settlements sprawl contiguously along the coast of Davao Gulf under the vast monotony of coconut plantations. On the western frontier, a plateau stretches toward Barangay Kapatagan of Digos. The municipal elevation ranges from {{Convert|10|to|2939|m}} above sea level (m.a.s.1.).
