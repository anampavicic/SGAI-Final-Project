{{Nihongo|'''Iwate Prefecture'''|岩手県|Iwate-ken}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture of Japan]] located in the [[Tōhoku region]] of [[Honshu]].<ref>Frédéric, "Tōhoku" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia|page=970}}</ref> It is the second-largest Japanese prefecture at {{convert|15,275|km2|sqmi}}, with a population of 1,165,886 (as of July 1, 2023). Iwate Prefecture borders [[Aomori Prefecture]] to the north, [[Akita Prefecture]] to the west, and [[Miyagi Prefecture]] to the south.

[[Morioka]] is the capital and largest city of Iwate Prefecture; other major cities include [[Ichinoseki, Iwate|Ichinoseki]], [[Ōshū, Iwate|Ōshū]], and [[Hanamaki, Iwate|Hanamaki]].<ref>Frédéric, "Morioka" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia|page=661}}</ref> Located on Japan's [[Pacific Ocean]] coast, Iwate Prefecture features the easternmost point of Honshu at [[Cape Todo]], and shares the highest peaks of the [[Ōu Mountains]]—the longest [[mountain range]] in Japan—at the border with Akita Prefecture. Iwate Prefecture is home to famous attractions such as [[Morioka Castle]], the [[Buddhist]] temples of [[Hiraizumi, Iwate|Hiraizumi]] including [[Chūson-ji]] and [[Mōtsū-ji]], the Fujiwara no Sato [[movie lot]] and [[theme park]] in Ōshū, and the Tenshochi park in [[Kitakami, Iwate|Kitakami]] known for its huge, ancient [[cherry tree]]s. Iwate has the lowest [[population density]] of any prefecture outside [[Hokkaido]], 5% of its total land area having been designated as [[List of national parks of Japan|National Parks]].

== Name ==
There are several theories about the origin of the name "Iwate", but the most well known is the tale ''[[Oni (folklore)|Oni]] no tegata'', which is associated with the Mitsuishi or "Three Rocks" Shrine in Morioka. These rocks are said to have been thrown down into Morioka by an eruption of Mt. Iwate. According to the legend, there was once a devil who often tormented and harassed the local people. When the people prayed to the spirits of Mitsuishi for protection, the devil was immediately shackled to these rocks and forced to make a promise never to trouble the people again.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bunka.pref.iwate.jp/seikatsu/kotoba/minwa/oninotegata.html |title=【民話・昔話】鬼の手形 |publisher=Bunka.pref.iwate.jp |access-date=7 June 2013}}</ref> As a seal of his oath, the devil made a handprint on one of the rocks, thus giving rise to the name Iwate, its direct translation being "rock hand". Even now after a rainfall, it is said that the devil's hand print can still be seen there.

== Culture ==
There are many present-day cultural foods popularly eaten in Iwate Prefecture, some of which include [[walnut]]s, [[wanko soba]] (meaning "bowl noodles") and hittsumi-jiru (meaning "pull and tear", in reference to the way the dough is pulled and torn into oval shapes before being turned into noodles).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sapporo.co.uk/news/japanese-culture-food-iwate/ |title=Japanese Culture and Food: Iwate |website=Sapporo.co.uk |access-date=27 March 2020 |archive-date=27 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200327021955/https://www.sapporo.co.uk/news/japanese-culture-food-iwate/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Iwate's prefectural capital [[Morioka]] is also popular for its apples, blooming in May and ready for [[harvest]] from September to November.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://japanold.com/2018/12/16/2037/ |title=A Story of Delicious Apples |website=Japanold.com |date=16 December 2018 |access-date=27 March 2020 |archive-date=10 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221210185926/https://japanold.com/2018/12/16/2037/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Japanese poet [[Matsuo Bashō]] visited Iwate and wrote about it in the journey described in his major work ''[[Oku no Hosomichi]]''. He was especially inspired by the town of [[Hiraizumi]].

== History ==
{{See also|Historic Sites of Iwate Prefecture}}
While the entire island of Honshū was claimed by the Japanese, or Yamato, government from earliest times, the imperial forces were unable to occupy any part of what would become Iwate until 802 when two powerful [[Emishi]] leaders, [[Aterui]] and More, surrendered at Fort Isawa.

The area now known as Iwate Prefecture was inhabited by the [[Jōmon period|Jōmon]] people who left their artifacts throughout the prefecture. For example, a large number of burial pits from the Middle Jōmon Period (2,800–1,900 BC) have been found in Nishida. Various sites from the Late Jōmon Period (1,900–1,300 BC) including Tateishi, Makumae and Hatten contain clay figurines, masks and ear and nose shaped clay artifacts. The Kunenbashi site in Kitakami City has yielded stone "swords", tablets and tools as well as clay figurines, earrings and potsherds from the Final Jōmon Period (1,300–300 BC).

The earliest mention of a Japanese presence dates to about 630 when the Hakusan Shrine was said to have been built on Mt. Kanzan in what is now Hiraizumi. At this time various Japanese traders, hunters, adventurers, priests and criminals made their way to Iwate. In 712 the province of [[Mutsu Province|Mutsu]], containing all of [[Tōhoku region|Tōhoku]], was divided into [[Dewa Province]], the area west of the [[Ōu Mountains|Ou Mountains]] and Mutsu Province. In 729 Kokuseki-ji Temple was founded in what is now Mizusawa Ward, Oshu City by the itinerant priest [[Gyōki]].

Little is known about relations between these Japanese frontiersmen and the native [[Emishi]] but in 776 they took a turn for the worse when large forces of the Yamato army invaded Iwate attacking the Isawa and Shiwa tribes in February and November of that year. More fighting occurred the next and following years but mostly in Dewa and the area south of present-day Iwate prefecture. This situation continued until March 787 when the Yamato army suffered a disastrous defeat in the Battle of Sufuse Village in what is now Mizusawa Ward, Oshu City. There the Emishi leaders and [[Aterui]] leading a large cavalry force trapped the Yamato infantry and pushed them into the Kitakami River where their heavy armour proved deadly. Over 1,000 soldiers drowned that day. The Japanese general Ki no Asami Kosami was "rebuked" by the [[Emperor Kanmu]] when he returned to Kyoto.

Since the Japanese could not win on the battlefield they resorted to other means to conquer the Emishi. Trade for superior quality iron wares and sake made the Emishi dependent on the Japanese for these valuable goods. Bribes were offered to the Emishi leaders in the form of Japanese citizenship and rank if they would defect. Finally a campaign of burning crops and kidnapping the Emishi women and children and relocating them to Western Japan was adopted. Many a stout warrior gave up the fight to join his family again.

In 801, [[Sakanoue no Tamuramaro]] began a new campaign against the Isawa Emishi having moderate success. Finally on 15 April 802 the Emishi leaders More and Aterui surrendered with some 500 warriors. The captives were taken to Kyoto for an audience with the emperor and beheaded at Moriyama in Kawachi Province against the wishes of General Sakanoue. This act of cruelty enraged the Emishi leading to another twenty or more years of fighting.

After the surrender numerous forts were built on the Chinese model along the Kitakami River. In 802, Fort Isawa was built in what is now Mizusawa Ward, Oshu City, in 803, Fort Shiwa was built in what is now Morioka City, and in 812 Fort Tokutan was built also in Morioka.

In the latter part of the [[Heian period]], the town of [[Hiraizumi]] in what is now southern Iwate became the capital of the [[Northern Fujiwara]]. The warrior [[Minamoto no Yoshitsune]] fled here after the [[Genpei War]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.iwate.jp/~hp0909/koto/densetu/syosai/syosai.htm |title=言い伝えられた平泉 |publisher=Iwate Prefectural Office |access-date=7 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013111330/http://www.pref.iwate.jp/~hp0909/koto/densetu/syosai/syosai.htm |archive-date=13 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Until the [[Meiji Restoration]], the area of Iwate prefecture was part of [[Mutsu Province]].<ref>Frédéric, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|Japan Encyclopedia|page=780}}, p. 780.</ref>

Iwate Prefecture was created in 1876, in the aftermath of the [[Boshin War|Boshin Civil War]], which heralded the beginning of the Meiji Restoration.

== Geography ==
[[File:Map of Iwate Prefecture Ja.svg|thumb|250px|Map of Iwate Prefecture<br />{{legend0|#EAB|City}} {{legend0|#ED9|Town}} {{legend0|#BFE|Village}}]]

Iwate faces the Pacific Ocean to the east with sheer, rocky cliffs along most of the shoreline interrupted by a few sandy beaches. The border with [[Akita Prefecture]] on the west is generally formed by the highest points of the [[Ōu Mountains]]. [[Aomori Prefecture]] is to the north and [[Miyagi Prefecture]] is to the south.

The Ōu mountains on the west still contain active volcanoes such as Mt. Iwate (at {{convert|2,038|m}} the highest point in the prefecture) and [[Mt. Kurikoma]] ({{convert|1,627|m}}). But the Kitakami Mountains running through the middle of the prefecture from north to south are much older and have not been active for thousands of years. Mt. Hayachine ({{convert|1,917|m}}) lies at the heart of the Kitakami range.

Besides these two mountain ranges and the rugged coastline, the prefecture is characterized by the Kitakami River which flows from north to south between the Ōu and Kitakami mountain ranges. It is the fourth longest river in Japan and the longest in Tōhoku. The basin of the Kitakami is large and fertile providing room for the prefecture's largest cities, industrial parks and farms.

In the past Iwate has been famous for its mineral wealth especially in the form of gold, iron, coal and sulfur but these are no longer produced. There is still an abundance of hot water for onsen, or hot springs, which is the basis of a thriving industry. The forests of the prefecture are another valuable resource. Before World War II the forests were mainly composed of beech but since then there has been a huge swing towards the production of faster growing Japanese cedar. Recently, though, there has been a push to restore the original beech forests in some areas.

As of 31 March 2019, 5% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|Natural Parks]], namely [[Towada-Hachimantai National Park|Towada-Hachimantai]] and [[Sanriku Fukkō National Park|Sanriku Fukkō]] National Parks; [[Kurikoma Quasi-National Park|Kurikoma]] and [[Hayachine Quasi-National Park|Hayachine]] Quasi-National Parks; and [[Goyōzan Prefectural Natural Park|Goyōzan]], [[Hanamaki Onsenkyō Prefectural Natural Park|Hanamaki Onsenkyō]], [[Kuji-Hiraniwa Prefectural Natural Park|Kuji-Hiraniwa]], [[Murone Kōgen Prefectural Natural Park|Murone Kōgen]], [[Oritsume Basenkyō Prefectural Natural Park|Oritsume Basenkyō]], [[Sotoyama-Hayasaka Prefectural Natural Park|Sotoyama-Hayasaka Heights]], and [[Yuda Onsenkyō Prefectural Natural Park|Yuda Onsenkyō]] Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.env.go.jp/park/doc/data/natural/naturalpark_4.pdf |script-title=ja:自然公園都道府県別面積総括 |trans-title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |language=ja |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |date=31 March 2019 |access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pref.iwate.jp/kurashikankyou/shizen/shizen/shizenkouen/1005441.html |script-title=ja:自然公園の種類 |trans-title=Types of Natural Parks |language=ja |publisher=Iwate Prefecture |access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref>

== Demographics ==
[[File:Iwate prefecture population pyramid in 2020.svg|thumb|271x271px|Iwate prefecture population pyramid in 2020]]
As of October 1, 2022, Iwate Prefecture had a population of 1,180,595. Consistent with [[Aging of Japan|population trends across Japan]], Iwate has experienced a slow, but steady decline in growth since the end of World War II with a major contributing factor being an aging population. As of October 2019, 33.1% of the population was over 65 with 15.4% aged between 65 and 74 and 17.7% over 75.<ref>{{Cite web|date=October 1, 2019|title=Current Population Estimates as of October 1, 2019|url=https://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/jinsui/2019np/index.html}}</ref> Moreover, the 1950 census saw the most births in the prefecture with 45,968 reported, but since then there has been a major decline to only 7,220 births from October 2018 to September 2019. This is in contrast to the 17,681 deaths recorded during the same period. Finally, Iwate has a net negative migration rate (-2.8) with 21,265 permanently leaving the prefecture and 16,795 entering.

== Transportation ==

=== Rail ===
Iwate is served by the [[East Japan Railway Company]] (JR East) which operates two high-speed [[shinkansen]] lines in the prefecture and seven local rail lines. The [[Tōhoku Shinkansen]] has stations at Ichinoseki, Oshu, Kitakami, Hanamaki, Morioka, Iwate Town and Ninohe. The [[Akita Shinkansen]] starts at Morioka Station and connects to locations in Akita Prefecture.

JR East operates passenger and freight trains on the [[Tōhoku Main Line]] or Tōhoku-honsen in Iwate but sold the track north of Morioka to the [[Iwate Galaxy Railway Line]] in 2002. The two lines share track with JR still running freight trains and some passenger trains over IGR track and IGR running occasional passenger trains as far south as Hanamaki. There is a large JR freight yard and maintenance facility in Yahaba.

Local lines include the Ofunato Line, the Kitakami Line, the Kamaishi Line, the Tazawako Line, the Yamada Line and the Hanawa Line.

Other lines include the [[Sanriku Railway]] which operates two lines along the coast, the North Rias Line and the South Rias Line.
