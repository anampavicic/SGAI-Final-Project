'''Muscat''' ({{langx|ar|مَسْقَط}}, {{transl|ar|''Masqaṭ''}} {{IPA|ar|ˈmasqatˤ|pron}}) is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and most populated city in [[Oman]]. It is the seat of the [[Muscat (governorate)|Governorate of Muscat]]. According to the [[National Centre for Statistics and Information]] (NCSI), the total population of Muscat Governorate was 1.72 million as of September 2022.<ref name="ncsi.gov.om">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsi.gov.om/News/Pages/NewsCT_20150628133452428.aspx|title=The population of the Sultanate by the end of May 2015|access-date=2015-07-05|archive-date=2017-08-04|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804014554/https://www.ncsi.gov.om/News/Pages/NewsCT_20150628133452428.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> The metropolitan area spans approximately {{convert|3500|km2|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite book|title=الدراسات الاجتماعية|publisher=Ministry of Education, Sultanate of Oman}}</ref> and includes six [[Provinces of Oman|province]]s called {{transl|ar|[[wilayat]]s}}, making it the largest city in the Arabian Peninsula by area.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Known since the early 1st century [[Anno Domini|AD]] as an important trading port between the [[Western world|west]] and the [[Eastern world|east]], Muscat was ruled by various indigenous tribes as well as foreign powers such as the [[Sassanid Empire|Persian]]s, the [[Portuguese Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] at various points in its history. A regional military power in the 18th century, Muscat's influence extended as far as [[East Africa]] and [[Zanzibar]]. As an important port-town in the [[Gulf of Oman]], Muscat attracted foreign traders and settlers such as the Persians, [[Baloch people|Baloch]]s and [[Sindhis]]. Since the accession of [[Qaboos bin Said]] as [[Sultan]] of Oman in 1970, Muscat has experienced rapid infrastructural development that has led to the growth of a vibrant economy and a multi-ethnic society. Muscat is termed as a Beta - [[Global City]] by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The World According to GaWC 2020 |url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |website=GaWC - Research Network |publisher=Globalization and World Cities |access-date=31 August 2020 |archive-date=24 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200824031341/https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2020t.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Hajar Mountains]] dominate the landscape of Muscat. The city lies on the [[Arabian Sea]] along the Gulf of Oman and is in the proximity of the strategic [[Straits of Hormuz]]. Low-lying white buildings typify most of Muscat's urban landscape, while the [[Mina Qaboos|port-district]] of [[Muttrah]], with its [[corniche]] and harbour, form the north-eastern periphery of the city. Muscat's economy is dominated by trade, petroleum, liquified natural gas and porting.

==Toponymy==
[[Ptolemy]]'s ''Map of Arabia'' identifies the territories of ''Cryptus Portus''<ref name="Foster 1844, p.231">Forster (1844), p.231.</ref> and ''Moscha Portus''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.241.</ref> Scholars are divided in opinion on which of the two is related to the city of ''Muscat''. Similarly, [[Arrian]]us references ''Omana'' and ''Moscha'' in ''Voyage of Nearchus''. Interpretations of Arrianus' work by [[William Vincent (priest)|William Vincent]] and [[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]] conclude that ''Omana'' was a reference to ''Oman'', while ''Moscha'' referred to ''Muscat''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.173.</ref> Similarly, other scholars identify [[Pliny the Elder]]'s reference to ''Amithoscuta'' to be ''Muscat''.<ref name="Foster 1844, p.231"/>

The origin of the word ''Muscat'' is disputed. Some authors claim that the word has [[Arabic language|Arabic]] origins &ndash; from ''moscha'', meaning an ''inflated hide'' or ''skin''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.173</ref> Other authors claim that the name ''Muscat'' means ''[[Anchorage (shipping)|anchorage]]'' or ''the place of "letting fall the anchor"''.<ref>Miles (1997), p.468.</ref> Other derivations include ''muscat'' from [[Old Persian]], meaning ''strong-scented'',<ref>Hailman (2006), p.49.</ref> or from [[Arabic language|Arabic]], meaning ''falling-place'',<ref>Philips (1966), p.4.</ref> or ''hidden''.<ref>Room (2003), p.246.</ref> ''Cryptus Portus'' is synonymous with Oman ("hidden land"). But "Ov-man" (Omman), and the old Sumerian name ''Magan (Maa-kan)'', means sea-people in Arabic. An inhabitant is a ''Muscatter'', ''Muscatian'', ''Muscatite'' or ''Muscatan''. In 1793 AD the capital was transferred from [[Rustaq]] to Muscat.

==History==
{{For timeline}}
Evidence of communal activity in the area around Muscat dates back to the 6th millennium BC in Ras al-Hamra, where burial sites of fishermen have been found. The graves appear to be well formed and indicate the existence of burial rituals. South of Muscat, remnants of [[Harappa]]n pottery indicate some level of contact with the [[Indus Valley civilisation]].<ref>Rice (1994), p.255-256</ref> Muscat's notability as a port was acknowledged as early as the 1st century AD by the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] geographer [[Ptolemy]], who referred to it as ''Cryptus Portus'' (the ''Hidden Port''), and by [[Pliny the Elder]], who called it ''Amithoscuta''.<ref>Forster (1844), p.234.</ref>

The port fell to a [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid]] invasion in the 3rd century AD, under the rule of [[Shapur I]],<ref>Potter (2002), p.41.</ref> while conversion to Islam occurred during the 7th century. Muscat's importance as a trading port continued to grow in the centuries that followed, under the influence of the [[Azd|Azd dynasty]], a local tribe. The establishment of the First [[Imamate]] in the 9th century was the first step in consolidating disparate Omani tribal factions under the banner of an [[Ibadi]] state. However, tribal skirmishes continued, allowing the [[Abbasid]]s of [[Baghdad]] to conquer Oman. The Abbasids occupied the region until the 11th century, when they were driven out by the local Yahmad tribe. Power over Oman shifted from the Yahmad tribe to the [[Azd]]i Nabahinah clan, during whose rule, the people of coastal ports such as Muscat prospered from maritime trade and close alliances with the [[Indian subcontinent]], at the cost of the alienation of the people of the interior of Oman. The [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]] admiral [[Afonso de Albuquerque]] sailed to Muscat in 1507, in an attempt to establish trade relations. As he approached the harbour, his ships were fired on. He then decided to conquer Muscat. Most of the city burned to the ground during and after the fighting.
[[File:MASCATE António Bocarro.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Muscat (Mascate) Portuguese Fortress in the 17th century. António Bocarro Book of Fortress.]] The Portuguese maintained a hold on Muscat for over a century, despite challenges from [[Persia]] and a bombardment of the town by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turks]] in 1546.<ref>Miles (1997), p.167</ref> The Turks twice captured Muscat from the Portuguese, in the [[Capture of Muscat (1552)]] and 1581–88. The election of [[Nasir bin Murshid|Nasir bin Murshid Al-Ya'rubi]] as Imam of Oman in 1624 changed the balance of power again in the region, from the Persians and the Portuguese to local Omanis. Among the most important castles and forts in Muscat, the [[Al Jalali Fort]] and the [[Al-Mirani Fort]] are the most prominent buildings left by the Portuguese. On August 16, 1648, the Imam dispatched an army to Muscat, which captured and demolished the high towers of the Portuguese, weakening their grip over the town. Decisively, in 1650, a small but determined body of the Imam's troops attacked the port at night, forcing an eventual Portuguese surrender on January 23, 1650.<ref>Miles (1997), p. 196.</ref> A civil war and repeated incursions by the Persian king [[Nader Shah]] in the 18th century destabilised the region, and further strained relations between the interior and Muscat. This power vacuum in Oman led to the emergence of the [[Al Bu Sa'id Dynasty|Al Bu Sa‘id dynasty]], which has ruled Oman ever since.<ref>Miles (1997), p.256.</ref>

Muscat's naval and military supremacy was re-established in the 19th century by [[Said bin Sultan]], who signed a treaty with U.S. President [[Andrew Jackson]]'s representative [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] on September 21, 1833.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cotheal |first=Alexander I. |date=1854 |title=Treaty between the United States of America and the Sultân of Masḳaṭ: The Arabic Text |journal=[[Journal of the American Oriental Society]] |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/592284 |volume=4 |pages=341, 343–356; here: 341–343 |format=free |jstor=592284 |access-date=2020-09-27 |archive-date=2020-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200828021312/https://www.jstor.org/stable/592284 |url-status=live }}</ref> Having gained control over [[Zanzibar]], in 1840 Said moved his capital to [[Stone Town]], the ancient quarter of [[Zanzibar City]]; however, after his death in 1856, control over Zanzibar was lost when it became an independent sultanate under his sixth son, [[Majid bin Said]] (1834/5–1870), while the third son, [[Thuwaini bin Said]], became the Sultan of Oman.

By the 19th century, a large Hindu merchant community in the port city dominated its commercial life. It is argued that their settlement at least since the fifteenth century; one of the reasons is that the Portuguese relied heavily on them to secure a trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf area. The [[Sindhis]] were amongst the first during this era, followed by the [[Kutchi people|Kutchis]]. The merchant community played an important role in expelling the Europeans in 1650. They were not affected by civil war that established the [[Al Bu Sa'id Dynasty|Al Bu Sa‘id dynasty]] and continued to prosper under [[Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi]]. Important trade existed between the city and [[Thatta]], and later, [[Kutch district|Kutch]], expanding to other parts of India.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Allen |first=Calvin H. |date=1981 |title=The Indian merchant community of Masqaṭ |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/product/identifier/S0041977X00104392/type/journal_article |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies |language=en |volume=44 |issue=1 |pages=39–53 |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00104392 |issn=0041-977X}}</ref>
[[File:Muscat harbor.jpg|thumb|left|Muscat harbour, ca. 1903. Visible in the background is [[Fort Al Jalali]].]]
During the second half of the 19th century, the fortunes of the Al Bu Sa‘id declined and friction with the Imams of the interior resurfaced. Muscat and [[Muttrah]] were attacked by tribes from the interior in 1895 and again in 1915.<ref>JE Peterson's Britannica entry (1990), p.6.</ref> A tentative ceasefire was brokered by the [[British East India|British]], which gave the interior more autonomy. However, conflicts among the disparate tribes of the interior, and with the Sultan of [[Muscat and Oman]] continued into the 1950s, and eventually escalated into the [[Dhofar Rebellion]] (1962). The rebellion forced the Sultan [[Said bin Taimur]] to seek the assistance of the British in quelling the uprisings from the interior. The failed assassination attempt of April 26, 1966 on Said bin Taimur led to the further isolation of the Sultan, who had moved his residence from Muscat to [[Salalah]], amidst the civilian armed conflict. On July 23, 1970, [[Qaboos bin Said]], son of the Sultan, staged a bloodless<ref>Long (2007), p.188.</ref> ''[[coup d'état]]'' in the Salalah palace with the assistance of the British, and took over as ruler.
[[File:WH1-Effo080a.jpg|thumb|Muscat harbour during [[World War I]]]]
With the assistance of the British, Qaboos bin Said put an end to the Dhofar uprising and consolidated disparate tribal territories. He renamed the country the ''[[Sultanate of Oman]]'' (called ''Muscat and Oman'' hitherto), in an attempt to end to the interior's isolation from Muscat. Qaboos enlisted the services of capable Omanis to fill positions in his new government,<ref>Middle East Policy (2004), p.126.</ref> drawing from such corporations as [[Petroleum Development Oman]]. New ministries for social services such as health and education were established. The construction of [[Mina Qaboos]], a new port conceived initially by Sa‘id bin Taimur, was developed during the early days of Qaboos' rule. Similarly, a [[Muscat International Airport|new international airport]] was developed in Muscat's [[Seeb]] district. A complex of offices, warehouses, shops and homes transformed the old village of [[Ruwi]] in Muttrah into a commercial district.<ref>Middle East Policy (2004), p.128</ref> The first five-year development plan in 1976 emphasised infrastructural development of Muscat, which provided new opportunities for trade and tourism in the 1980s–1990s, attracting migrants from around the region. On June 6, 2007, [[Cyclone Gonu]] hit Muscat causing extensive damage to property, infrastructure and commercial activity.

Muscat is located in northeast Oman. The [[Tropic of Cancer]] passes south of the area. It is bordered to its west by the plains of the [[Al Batinah Region]] and to its east by [[Ash Sharqiyah Region (Oman)|Ash Sharqiyah Region]]. The interior plains of [[Ad Dakhiliyah Region]] border Muscat to the south, while the [[Gulf of Oman]] forms the northern and western periphery of the city.

The Sultan Qaboos Street forms the main artery of Muscat, running west-to-east through the city. The street eventually becomes Al Nahdah Street near Al Wattayah. Several inter-city roads such as Nizwa Road and Al Amrat Road, intersect with Al Sultan Qaboos Road (in Rusail and [[Ruwi]], respectively). [[Muttrah]], with the Muscat Harbour, [[Corniche]], and [[Mina Qaboos]], is located in the north-eastern coastline of the city, adjacent to the Gulf of Oman. Other coastal districts of Muscat include [[Darsait]], [[Mina Al Fahal]], Ras Al Hamar, [[Al Qurum]] Heights, Al Khuwair, and [[Seeb, Oman|Al Seeb]]. Residential and commercial districts further inland include [[Al Hamriyah]], [[Wadi Kabir|Al Wadi Al Kabir]], [[Ruwi]], Al Wattayah, [[Madinat Qaboos]], Al Azaiba and [[Al Ghubra]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Muscat}}

Muscat features a hot, [[arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh'') with long, sweltering summers and warm winters.  Annual [[rainfall]] in Muscat is about {{convert|10|cm|in|0|disp=or}}, falling mostly from December to April. In general, precipitation is scarce in Muscat, with the months May to November typically receiving only a trace of rainfall. However, in recent years, heavy precipitation events from tropical systems originating in the Arabian Sea have struck the city. [[Cyclone Gonu]] in June 2007 and [[Cyclone Phet]] in June 2010 affected the city with damaging winds and rainfall amounts exceeding {{convert|100|mm|in|0|disp=or}} in just a single day. The climate generally is very hot and also very humid in the summer, with temperatures sometimes reaching as high as {{convert|45|°C|°F|disp=or}}.

==Economy==
[[File:Land Rover and Extreme Sailing Series™ enjoy thrill of Stadium Racing in Muscat (13346080234).jpg|thumb|Offshore Sailing in Muscat]]

Muscat's economy, like that of Oman, is dominated by trade. The more traditional exports of the city included [[Date (fruit)|dates]], [[mother of pearl]], and fish. Many of the [[souk]]s of Muttrah sell these items and traditional [[Omani]] artefacts. [[Petroleum Development Oman]] has been central to Muscat's economy since at least 1962 and is the country's second largest employer, after the government. Its major shareholders include [[Shell plc|Shell]], Total, and Partex and its production is estimated to be about {{convert|720000|oilbbl/d|m3/d}}. Muscat also has major trading companies such as the Suhail Bahwan Group, which is a trading partner for corporations such as [[Toshiba]], [[Subaru]], [[Seiko]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], [[RAK Ceramics]]; Saud Bahwan Group whose trading partners are [[Toyota]], [[Daihatsu]], KIA and [[Hertz Rent-a-Car]]; Zubair Automotive whose trading partners include [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Chrysler]] brands such as Dodge; and [[Moosa AbdulRahman Hassan]] which operates as one of the oldest automotive agencies in the entire region having been established in 1927.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} The private Health Care sector of Muscat, Oman has numerous hospitals and clinics.

The [[Muscat Securities Market]] is the principal stock exchange of Oman. It is located in Central Business District of Muscat and it was established in 1988, and has since distinguished itself as a pioneer among its regional peers in terms of transparency and disclosure regulations and requirements.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Muscat Stock Exchange (MSX) – Arab Federation of Capital Markets |url=https://arab-exchanges.org/member/muscat-securities-market-msm/ |access-date=2022-09-13 |language=en-US |archive-date=2022-09-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220913195907/https://arab-exchanges.org/member/muscat-securities-market-msm/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Mina'a Sultan Qaboos, Muscat's main trading port, is a trading hub between the [[Persian Gulf]], the [[Indian subcontinent]] and the Far East with an annual volume of about 1.6 million tons. However, the emergence of the [[Jebel Ali Free Zone]] in neighboring [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]], has made that port the premier maritime trading port of the region with about 44 million tons traded in cargo annually. Many infrastructural facilities are owned and operated by the government of Oman. [[Omantel]] is the major telecommunications organization in Oman and provides local, long-distance and international dialing facilities and operates as the country's only [[Internet Service Provider|ISP]]. Recent liberalization of the mobile telephone market has seen the establishment of a second provider, [[Ooredoo]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Demographics==
According to the 2003 [[census]] conducted by the Oman Ministry of National Economy, the population of Muscat is over 630,000, which included 370,000 males and 260,000 females.<ref name="Oman Census 2003, p.6">Oman Census (2003), p.6.</ref> Muscat formed the second largest governorate in the country, after [[Al Batinah Region|Al Batinah]], accounting for 27% of the total population of Oman. As of 2003, [[Omani]]s constituted 60% of the total population of Muscat, while expatriates accounted for about 40%.<ref>Oman Census (2003), p.9.</ref> The [[population density]] of the city was 162.1 per km{{sup|2}}.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}
[[File:Shangri La resort in Muscat.jpg|thumb|218x218px|Shangri la in Muscat]]
The governorate of Muscat comprises six {{transl|ar|[[wilayat]]s}}: [[Muttrah]], Bawshar, [[Seeb]], Al Amrat, Muscat and [[Qurayyat, Oman|Qurayyat]]. Seeb, located in the western section of the governorate, was the most populous (with over 220,000 residents), while Muttrah had the highest number of expatriates (with over 100,000).<ref name="Oman Census 2003, p.6" /> Approximately 71% of the population was within the 15–64 age group, with the average Omani age being 23 years.<ref>Oman Census(2003), Data and Other Indicators</ref> About 10% of the population is [[literacy rate|illiterate]], an improvement when compared to the 18% illiteracy rate recorded during the 1993 census. Expatriates accounted for over 60% of the [[labour force]], dominated by males, who accounted for 80% of the city's total labour. A majority of expatriates (34%) was in engineering-related occupations, while most Omanis worked in engineering, clerical, scientific or technical fields. The [[Royal Army of Oman|defense]] sector was the largest employer for Omanis, while construction, [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] trade employed the largest number of expatriates.

The ethnic makeup of Muscat has historically been influenced by people not native to the Arabian Peninsula. [[British Parliament]]ary papers dating back to the 19th century indicate the presence of a significant [[Hindu people|Hindu]] [[Gujarat]]i [[merchant]]s in the city.<ref>British Parliamentary Papers (1876), p. 189.</ref> Indeed, four [[Hinduism|Hindu]] [[Hindu temple|temples]] existed in Muscat ca. 1760.<ref>Kechichian (1995), p. 215.</ref> [[Christianity]] flourished in Oman (Bēṯ Mazūnāyē "land of the Maganites"; a name deriving from its Sumerian designation) from the late 4th century to the 7th century. Missionary activity by the [[Assyrian People|Assyrians]] of the [[Church of the East]] resulted in a significant Christian population living in the region, with a bishop being attested by 424 AD under the Metropolitan of Fars and Arabia. The rise of Islam saw the [[Syriac language|Syriac]] and Arabic-speaking Christian population eventually disappear. It is thought to have been brought back in by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] in 1507.<ref>Fahlbusch (1999), p. 829.</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2022}} [[Protestant]] [[missionaries]] established a hospital in Muscat in the 19th century.

Like the rest of Oman, [[Arabic (language)|Arabic]] is the predominant language of the city. In addition, [[English (language)|English]], [[Balochi language|Balochi]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[India]]n languages such as [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Hindi]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Malayalam]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu]]<ref>Peterson (2004), p. 34.</ref> are spoken by the residents of Muscat.

[[Islam]] is the predominant religion in the city, with most followers being [[Ibadi]] [[Muslim]]s. Non-Muslims are allowed to practise their religion, but may not [[proselytize]] publicly or distribute religious literature. In 2017 the Sultanate of Oman unveiled the ''Mushaf Muscat'', an [[Interactive computing|interactive]] [[Calligraphy#Islamic world|calligraphic]] Quran following a brief from the [[Omani Ministry of Endowments and Religious Affairs]].<ref>[[Martin Lejeune]], 15 June 2017, [https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/oman-unveils-world-s-1st-interactive-calligraphic-quran/842512 Oman unveils world’s 1st interactive calligraphic Quran] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210523075112/https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/oman-unveils-world-s-1st-interactive-calligraphic-quran/842512 |date=2021-05-23 }}</ref>

Here also, the traditional boats of Arabian Peninsula named [[Dhow]]s can be also seen. This port since many centuries have been a main commercial and financial centre in terms of its international maritime trade.

'''Airport'''

'''Road Transportation'''
The Muscat area is well serviced by paved roads and [[dual-carriageway]] connects most major cities and towns in the country. 
[[File:Oman-Muscat-Muttrah-21-Marina.JPG|thumb|Mutrah]]
Since November 2015, Public transportation in Muscat has been revamped with a bus network connecting most important parts of the city with a fleet of modern Mwasalat (earlier Oman National Transport Company buses.

Several forms of public transport are popular in Oman. Most popular are the "Baiza" buses, so named for the lower denomination of the [[Omani rial]], the baiza (an adaptation of the [[India]]n lower denomination [[paisa]]). These are relatively inexpensive and service all major roadways, as well as a wide and loose network of smaller byways in the greater Muscat metropolitan area, opportunistically dropping off and picking up passengers at any location. Less popular and slightly more expensive are large public buses, coloured red and green, whose service is limited to major roadways and point-to-point travel routes between Oman's major cities and towns. Taxis, also colour-coded orange and white, provide semi-personal transportation in the form of both individual hire and the same opportunistic roadway service as Baiza buses.

Baiza buses and colour-coded orange-and-white taxis are unmetered, after several government initiatives to introduce meters were rejected. The fare is set by way of [[negotiation]], although taxi drivers usually adhere to certain unwritten rules for fares within the city. In many countries, one is advised to negotiate a fare with the driver before getting into a taxi. However, in Oman, asking for the fare beforehand often demonstrates a passenger's newness and unfamiliarity with the area. One should always find out the normally accepted fare for one's journey from one's hotel or host before looking for a taxi. Taxis also generally take passengers to locations out of the city, including [[Sohar]], [[Buraimi]] and [[Dubai]].

Oman has a long tradition of shipbuilding, as maritime travel played a major role in the Omanis' ability to stay in contact with the civilisations of the ancient world. [[Sur, Oman|Sur]] was one of the most famous shipbuilding cities of the Indian Ocean. The Al Ghanja ship takes one whole year to build.
