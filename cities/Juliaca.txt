'''Juliaca''' ({{IPA|es|xuˈljaka|lang}}; [[Quechua language|Quechua]] and {{lang-ay|Hullaqa}}) is the capital of [[San Román Province]] in the [[Puno Region]] of southeastern [[Peru]]. It is the region's largest city with a population of 276,110 inhabitants ([[2017 Peru Census|2017]]).<ref>[http://censos.inei.gob.pe/Censos2007/IndDem/ Peruvian Census] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220211425/http://censos.inei.gob.pe/Censos2007/IndDem/ |date=20 December 2010 }}</ref> On the [[Altiplano]], Juliaca is {{convert|3825|m|ft}} above sea level, is located on the Collao Plateau and is northwest of [[Lake Titicaca]] (45&nbsp;km). It is the largest trade center in the Puno region.

Juliaca is near [[Chachas Lake]], the Maravillas river, and near the ruins of [[Sillustani]].

The city hosts [[Juliaca's Carnival]] each year between February and March. During this very popular event participants, dressed in colorful costumes, gather on the streets to dance in the style of the Collao Plateau. Saint Sebastian's feast is celebrated on 20 January of every year.

Juliaca's citizens rely on cars, trains, and bicycles. It is a major transit point in the region and has strong ties with Peru's southern cities, including [[Arequipa]], [[Puno]], [[Tacna]], [[Cuzco]], [[Ilo, Peru|Ilo]], and with [[La Rinconada, Peru|La Rinconada]] and [[Bolivian Republic|Bolivia]].

Like [[Chicago]], Illinois, it is nicknamed "The Windy City", in its case, because of the city's location on the windy Collao Plateau. It is also called the "Sock City" or "Knitting City" because Juliaca was a major center of sock, sweater, and handicraft production. Now the production of clothes, wool and fabrics are industrial processes.

[[File:Localización de Juliaca.JPG|thumb|260px]]
It is also home to [[Inca Manco Capac Airport]], the region's main airport.

==Etymology==
The historian Ramon Rios argues that Juliaca comes from the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] words ''Xullaskca kaipi'' (it had drizzled) in allusion that when the Inca troops arrived at this part of the Altiplano chasing the ''[[colla people|collas]]'', they noticed that in the Huaynarroque hill it had drizzled.

However, Justo Ruelas affirms that Juliaca comes from the Quechua word ''Shulla Qaqa'' (roquedal dew), due to the fact that in the vicinity of the Huaynarroque and Santa Cruz hills, small quartz particles can be seen, which resembles the morning dew that falls on rocks.

==History==
===Pre-Spanish arrival===
The Altiplano was inhabited from around 4,000 BC by sedentary communities dedicated to agriculture and livestock ([[llama]]s and [[guinea pig]]s).

The [[Uros]] settled in the river towns, taking advantage of the benefits of the [[totora (plant)|totora]] and the fish of [[Lake Titicaca]], settled in the surrounding lakes: [[Chacas]], Qoriwata, Cochapampa, and the Juliaca River, today Coata River.

{{Quote|text="The Indians who are called Uros...live on the banks where they fish, with which they support themselves...they are strong Indians and of good disposition and there are many who are in the lakes without making sementeras or clothes, eating from roots that they call totora."|author= Garcí Diez|title=Crónicas en América|source=<ref>{{Cite book

The constitution of these settlers were registered as ''Uros de Coata'' and ''Uros de Desaguadero'', from where the Uros of Coata would be better communicated and related to Juliaca, by the river that linked them, also these riverine settlers developed a sailing technique, on rafts made of [[totora (plant)|totora]], fastened with yarned ropes based on the [[Stipa ichu|ichus]], which would serve as support for fishing, and at times, of transport from Lake Titicaca to the smaller lakes that were between the territories of Juliaca.

{{Quote|text="As a testimony of the ancient presence of the Uros, in the balsero partiality, and later in the rafts of Juliaca, there have been some names of places: Totoral, Torococha..."|author=René Calsín Anco|title=Bodas de diamante de la provincia de San Román|source=<ref>{{Cite book

Between the years 1000 to 500 BC, Juliaca flourished under the influence of [[Qaluyo]] (ancient settlement), in the place of Qomer Moqo ([[Taparachi]]). Archaeologists discovered a small village dating back to this time, whose settlers were fed with [[Solanum tuberosum|potatoes]], [[Chenopodium quinoa|quinoa]], [[kañiwa]], carachi, guinea pig, among others. They were the first builders of [[waruwaru]]s and developed a special textile industry.

In the years 200 BC to 200 AD, the domain of the [[Pukara culture]] expanded in this region of the highlands. Between the third and fourth centuries, the [[Huaynarroque]] tribe flourished. Subsequently, the hegemony of [[Tiwanaku empire|Tiahuanaco]], [[Qulla|Colla]] and [[Inca Empire|Inka]] arises consecutively. The kollas and Inka were ruthless rivals and only under the military command of [[Pachacuti|Pachacútec]] and his son [[Mayta Capac]] were able to subdue the brave Sapana, Chuchicápac and Huaynarroque tribes after bloody wars of conquest.

===21st century===
During [[2017–present Peruvian political crisis|a political crisis]], 18 protestors [[Juliaca massacre|were shot dead]] by the [[National Police of Peru|police]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/22/briefing/peru-protests.html |title=Briefing: Peru Protests |publisher=New York Times |date=January 22, 2023}}</ref>

==Economy==
Juliaca is a large trade center for [[good (economics)|goods]] and [[service (economics)|services]], and is considered the financial capital of the [[Puno region]]. Trade is its principal economic activity, comprising 26.5% of the [[Labor force]]. In 2008, Juliaca had 15,439 commercial establishments,<ref>[http://www1.inei.gob.pe/perucifrasHTM/inf-soc/cuadro.asp?cod=9328&name=d21_16&ext=jpg Peruvian government figures]</ref> which amounts to 41% of trade done in the Puno region. It is the commercial hub for the [[La Rinconada, Peru|La Rinconada]] high-altitude city of informal gold mining.<ref>William Finnegan, "Tears of the Sun: The Gold Rush at the Top of the World." ''The New Yorker'', 20 April 2015: 55–65</ref>

The city of Juliaca has become a center of capital investment.{{cn|date=January 2023}} As a result, poverty has been reduced, and increased per capita income has come to some of its residents.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

==Geography==
===Climate===
Juliaca has a [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwb/Cwc'') bordering on an [[alpine climate|alpine tundra climate]] (''ETH'') with cool to cold temperatures most of the year. The average annual precipitation is {{convert|610|mm|in|0|disp=or}}. Winters are dry with freezing nights and mornings, and pleasant afternoon temperatures.
