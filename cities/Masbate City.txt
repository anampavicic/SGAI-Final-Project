'''Masbate City''', officially the '''City of Masbate''' ([[Masbateño language|Masbateño]]: ''Syudad san Masbate''; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Masbate}}), is a 4th class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] and capital of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Masbate]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 104,522 people.{{PH census|current}}

As the most populous and the only city in the province, Masbate City serves as the province's main commercial center and chief seaport. The city is more or less situated at the center of Masbate province and [[Masbate Island]], about 212 aerial miles and 362 nautical miles from Manila. It is noted for its well-protected seaport, with [[Ticao Island]] acting as barrier against the effects of inclement weather from the north-east. Being located at the central part of the Philippine archipelago, the city serves as Bicol Region's gateway to the [[Visayas]] and [[Mindanao]]. It is accessible through sea and air transportation. 

== Etymology ==
Some accounts claim that "Masbate" was coined after the words "''masa''" and "''bate''" or from another word "''masibat''" remains anecdotal up to the present. Other accounts claim that the term "Masbate" comes from "masbad" which means "machete".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=The City {{!}} City of Masbate |url=https://cityofmasbate.gov.ph/the-city/#:~:text=And%20in%20the%201850s,%20there,Malobago%20(Cataingan)%20in%201872 |access-date=2024-09-24 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
===Spanish colonial era and the Philippine Revolution===
The islands of [[Masbate Island|Masbate]], [[Ticao Island|Ticao]] and [[Burias (island)|Burias]] were explored by [[Captain Luis Enriquez de Guzman]] in 1569. This exploration work was continued by [[Captain Andres de Ibarra]]. Ibalon ([[Albay]]) Province assumed jurisdiction over Masbate Islands, and Masbate was named the town's capital village; for security reasons, the seat of government had to be moved time and time again. It was first moved to Mobo and then again, to Guiom. It was later transferred to Palanog near the mouth of Lumbang River to make it more accessible to [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] mainland and to the islands of Burias and Ticao. However, government records were kept inland in Cagay.<ref name=history>{{cite web|title=History of Masbate City|url=http://www.masbatecity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=126&Itemid=90|publisher=Official Website of the City of Masbate|access-date=May 2, 2014|date=September 3, 2013}}</ref>

The Spaniards found several gold mines in the mountains now covered by the town of Aroroy. And in the 1850s, there were Spanish settlements in Masbate. the town of Masbate was first founded in 1864. they later founded the Pueblo de Cervantéz (later named Placer) and the Town of Milagros in 1869 and the town of Malobago (Cataingan) in 1872.<ref name=":0" />

The political history of the town dates back to the 1850s when the [[Spaniards]] established their government under a [[Spain|Spanish]] gobernadorcillo. Spanish control over Masbate was lost in mid-1898 when the Pulahanes forces besieged the town before handing it to the Philippine revolutionaries that arrived in Masbate soon after.

===Philippine-American War===
Sometime after General Emilio Aguinaldo [[Philippine Declaration of Independence|declared Philippine independence]] at [[Kawit]], [[Cavite]], he issued a military order to overthrow the [[Spain|Spanish]] Government in [[Masbate]] and the [[Visayas]]. General [[Justo Lucban]] and General Diego de Dios acted on this order with the help of Masbateño rebels under Pedro Kipte. Immediately thereafter, the military government under Aguinaldo's government was established. But when the American forces reached Masbate in November 1900, it took over the government of Masbate without any resistance from the Masbateños.<ref name=history/>

===American colonial era===
[[File:Philippine Island - Masbate - NARA - 68156002.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Masbate, 1936]]

After a devastating typhoon in 1908, an Executive Order was passed annexing the province of Masbate to the province of [[Sorsogon]]. Masbate, by force of circumstance, became a sub-province of [[Sorsogon]] until 1922 when its provincial status was restored. Shortly before the restoration of [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|Philippine Independence]] in 1946, the town of Masbate was established as the provincial capital.<ref name=history/>

During World War II, the first elements of Japanese troops from Legazpi arrive on Masbate province at the dawn of January 7, 1942, on several places without any opposition as the forces stationed there retreated to Panay Island.

===Independent Philippines===
In the mid-1990s, the idea of converting the municipality into a city was pushed by 2nd District House Representative Luz Cleta Reyes Bakunawa. Her successor, Congressman Emilio Espinosa Jr. together with the Municipal Mayor Juan P. Sanchez Sr. and some local officials and employees took over where she left off.

====Cityhood====
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
On August 16, 2000, President [[Joseph Estrada]] signed [[Republic Act]] 8807 converting the Municipality of Masbate into a component city. In a plebiscite held later that year, Masbateños voted 7,800 to 3,200 in favor of cityhood, and on September 30, 2000, the Commission on Elections Regional Office in Region 5 officially proclaimed Masbate as a component city.<ref name=history/>

==Geography==
The city is bounded on the north-east by Masbate Pass; on the south-west by the municipality of [[Milagros, Masbate|Milagros]] and on the north-west by a portion of Asid River and the municipalities of Milagros and [[Baleno, Masbate|Baleno]].

The city's territory, with {{convert|37.6|km}} of shoreline, includes {{convert|300|km2}} of municipal waters, {{convert|1240|ha}} of mangroves, {{convert|560|ha}} of coral reefs, and {{convert|400|ha}} of sea grasses.

{{div col end}}

;Anas: Anas came from the word "Dangas" which literally means bald. A native whose hair had seriously thinned out at the pâté lived in this place. "Dangas" later on became "Angas" and finally "Angas" became "Anas". Anas was established as a barangay in 1880 by the following persons: Vicente Lerit, Lorenzo Verano, Pedro Bello, Juan Cortes and Cornelio Bello. The tenientes who served the barangay in early times were Pedro Bello, Tomas Cortes, Antonio Suplito, Pedro Badillo, Timoteo Asne, Andres Verano, Epifanio Buhion, Felipe Zaragoza, Constantino Zaragoza, Casiano Lerit, Lucio Lerit, Bernabe Asne, Carmelito Cortes and Serapio Serrano. The sitios of Anas are Purang, Cabanatihan, Can-anab and Libas.
;Ibingay: Barangay Ibingay was originally called Punta Ibingay the name came from the word "Bingcay" or assorted seashells, which children played with, while their mothers were busy with the entre cuatro or card playing. In 1973, it was renamed "Balo" or swordfish, the kind of fish often caught by fishermen in Ibingay waters. However, "Balo" did not stick. People continued to refer to the place as "Ibingay". So, today, Ibingay remains as its official name.
; Asid: Asid, according to the legend, was formerly called "Asin". Asid River separates Masbate City from Milagros Municipality. This barangay is known for its bamboo craft. Incidentally, Asid is also the name for the gulf which is a rich fishing ground in the vicinity of Milagros town.
; B. Titong: Barangay B. Titong was named after Benigno Titong Jr. who donated the barangay site of B. Titong. His father, Benigno Sr. was a German national who came to Masbate as a trader of lumber. He settled in what is now B. Titong. Formerly the place was called "Bugsayon". The barangay was established in 1890. The original families of Bugsayon were the Veranos, Tumambacs and the Titongs. The first Teniente del Barrio was Bernaldo Verano followed by Eulogio Verano, Isidro Verano, Felipe Verano and Mario Verano.
;Bagumbayan: Bagumbayan was formerly called "goma". In time, the place was used by laborers as a temporary corral for cattle while the shippers were waiting for the vessel that would transport the animals to Manila. Later, the laborers called the place Bagumbayan or New Town when transients built their homes near the shore and a community was created. The name "goma" was forgotten due to disuse. Today, Bagumbayan is bursting at the seams so to speak, because of the influx of people.
;Bantigue: Bantigue, a barangay across the sea facing the city poblacion is a fishing village founded by the Boholano fishermen who migrated to Masbate sometime in the 1950s. Its name was derived from the Borobantigue tree, a species of mangrove abundantly growing in the Bantigue mudflats in the olden days. Bantigue barangay is better known as the place where the native dance "Lapay Bantigue" originated.
;Bapor: Barangay Bapor in earlier times was called "Puerto de San Antonio", then it was named Muelle later on, and then renamed "Eldorado", because this was the name of the Corporation which bought copra, the bodega of which was called El Dorado. In 1973, it was named bapor because of the ships that dock at Masbate wharf, which is found in the barangay. An incident tells that in 1973, when the barangay officials were deliberating and mulling on the proper name for their barangay, an incoming boat sounded its horn. Then, someone in the group said, "Why don't we call this place "Bapor" and everyone nodded in approval.
;Batuhan: Barangay Batuhan came from "Kabatuhan" meaning, where rocks or boulders abound. The locality of this barangay has a large deposit of marble rocks or "kabatuhan".
