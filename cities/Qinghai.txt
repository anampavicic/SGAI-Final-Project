It is the largest [[provinces of China|province of China]] (excluding autonomous regions) by area and has the third smallest population. Its capital and largest city is [[Xining]].

Qinghai borders [[Gansu]] on the northeast, [[Xinjiang]] on the northwest, [[Sichuan]] on the southeast and the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] on the southwest. Qinghai province was established in 1928 during the period of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], and until 1949 was ruled by [[Hui people|Chinese Muslim]] warlords known as the [[Ma clique]]. The [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name "Qinghai" is after [[Qinghai Lake]], the largest lake in China. The lake is known as Tso ngon in Tibetan, and as Kokonor Lake in English, derived from the Mongol [[Oirat language|Oirat]] name for Qinghai Lake. Both Tso ngon and Kokonor are names found in historic documents to describe the region.<ref name= "Khishong">Gangchen Khishong, 2001. ''Tibet and Manchu: An Assessment of Tibet-Manchu Relations in Five Phases of Development''. Dharmasala: Narthang Press, p.1-70.</ref>

Located mostly on the [[Tibetan Plateau]], the province is inhabited by a number of peoples including the [[Han Chinese|Han]] (concentrated in the provincial capital of Xining, nearby [[Haidong]], and [[Haixi Mongol and Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Haixi]]), [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Mongols]], [[Monguor people|Monguor]]s, and [[Salar people|Salar]]s. According to the 2021 census reports, Tibetans constitute a fifth of the population of Qinghai and the Hui compose roughly a sixth of the population. There are over 37 recognized ethnic groups among Qinghai's population of 5.6 million, with [[Ethnic minorities in China|national minorities]] making up a total of 49.5% of the population.

The area of Qinghai came under the control of the [[Manchu]]-led [[Qing Dynasty]] around 1724, after their defeat of [[Khoshut]] Mongols who previously controlled most of the area. After the [[Xinhai Revolution]] and the ensuing fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, Qinghai came under Chinese Muslim warlord [[Ma Qi]]'s control until the [[Northern Expedition]] by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] consolidated central control in 1928. In the same year, the province of Qinghai was established by the [[Nationalist government|Nationalist Government]], with Xining as its capital.<ref>{{cite news|date=Sep 1928|volume=93 |issue=|page=5|url=https://twinfo.ncl.edu.tw/tiqry/hypage.cgi?HYPAGE=search/merge_pdf.hpg&dtd_id=12&type=g&sysid=E1237279&jid=79001163&vol=17090005&page=%E9%A0%815|magazine=國民政府公報|title=中華民國政府令|publisher=國民政府秘書處|access-date=|location=Republic of China}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=27 Oct 1928|issue=2|page=9|url=https://twinfo.ncl.edu.tw/tiqry/hypage.cgi?HYPAGE=search/merge_pdf.hpg&dtd_id=12&type=g&sysid=E1222064&jid=79001163&vol=17102700&page=%E9%A0%818-12|magazine=國民政府公報|title=中華民國十七年十月十九日 中華民國政府令|publisher=國民政府文官處印鑄局|access-date=|location=Republic of China}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=31 Jan 1929|issue=80|pages=8–9|url=https://twinfo.ncl.edu.tw/tiqry/hypage.cgi?HYPAGE=search/merge_pdf.hpg&dtd_id=12&type=g&sysid=E1217949&jid=79001163&vol=18013100&page=%E9%A0%818-9|magazine=國民政府公報|title=中華民國十八年一月二十九日 國民政府指令一八九號|publisher=國民政府文官處印鑄局|access-date=|location=Republic of China}}</ref>

==History==
During the [[Bronze Age]], Qinghai was home to a diverse group of nomadic tribes closely related to other Central Asians who traditionally made a living in [[agriculture]] and [[husbandry]], the [[Kayue culture]]. The eastern part of the area of Qinghai was under the control of the [[Han dynasty]] about 2,000 years ago. It was a battleground during the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and subsequent [[Zhongyuan|Central Plain]] dynasties when they fought against successive [[History of Tibet|Tibetan tribes]].<ref>[http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/history4.html Purdue – Tibetan history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821011751/http://cc.purdue.edu/~wtv/tibet/history4.html|date=2007-08-21}}.</ref>

In the middle of 3rd century CE, nomadic people related to the [[Mongol]]ic [[Xianbei]] migrated to pasture lands around the [[Qinghai Lake]] (Koko Nur) and established the [[Tuyuhun Kingdom]].

In the 7th century, the Tuyuhun Kingdom was attacked by both the [[Tibetan Empire]] and the Tang dynasty as both sought control over the [[Silk Road]] trade routes. Tibetan King [[Songtsen Gampo]] was victorious, and settled the area around Tso ngon (Lake Go, or Kokonor Lake).<ref>Laurent Deshayes, 1997. ''Histoire du Tibet''. Paris: Fayard.</ref> Military conflicts had severely weakened the Tuyuhun kingdom and it was incorporated into the Tibetan Empire. The Tibetan Empire continued expanding beyond Tso ngon during [[Trisong Detsen]]'s and [[Ralpacan]]'s reigns, and the empire controlled vast areas north and east of Tso ngon until 848,<ref>Gertraud Taenzer, 2012. ''The Dunhuang Region during Tibetan Rule (787-848)''. (Berlin): Harrassowitz Verlag.</ref> which included [[Xi'an]].

During the [[Era of Fragmentation|fragmentation of the Tibetan Empire]], a series of local polities emerged under the political jostling of [[Western Xia]] to the north and [[Song dynasty]] to the east -- from the military-rule of [[Guiyi Circuit]], to a Tibetan tribal confederacy, and eventually [[Tsongkha|the Tibetan theocratic kingdom of Tsongkha]]. The [[Song dynasty]] eventual defeated the Kokonor kingdom Tsongkha in the 1070s.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=cbDee_nEkYcC&pg=PA57 Leung 2007], p. 57.</ref> During the Mongol-led [[Yuan dynasty]]'s [[Tibet under Yuan rule|administrative rule of Tibet]], the region comprised the headwaters of the Ma chu (Machu River, [[Yellow River]]) and the Yalong ([[Yangtze]]) rivers and was known as [[Amdo]], but apportioned to different administrative divisions than Tibet proper.<ref>{{cite book|title=China's Tibet?: Autonomy or Assimilation|first=Warren W|last=Smith|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|year=2009|pages=24, 252}}</ref>

Most of Qinghai was, for a short time in the aftermath of the Yuan dynasty's overthrow, under the control of early [[Ming dynasty]], but later gradually lost to the [[Khoshut Khanate]] founded by the [[Oirats]]. The [[Xunhua Salar Autonomous County]] is where most [[Salar people]] live in Qinghai. The Salars migrated to Qinghai from [[Samarkand]] in 1370.<ref name="Betta">{{cite book|title=The Other Middle Kingdom: A Brief History of Muslims in China|first=Chiara|last=Betta|publisher=Indianapolis University Press|year=2004|page=21}}</ref> The chief of the four upper clans around this time was Han Pao-yuan and Ming granted him office of centurion, it was at this time the people of his four clans took Han as their surname.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEMeAQAAIAAJ&q=salar+han+ma+surname|title=Gladstone-Gordon correspondence, 1851–1896: selections from the private correspondence of a British Prime Minister and a colonial Governor, Volume 51|author=William Ewart Gladstone, Baron Arthur Hamilton-Gordon Stanmore|year=1961|publisher=American Philosophical Society|page=27|isbn=9780871695147|access-date=2010-06-28}}</ref> The other chief Han Shan-pa of the four lower Salar clans got the same office from Ming, and his clans were the ones who took Ma as their surname.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uEMeAQAAIAAJ&q=The+clan+chief+Han+Shan-pa+had+also+received+the+office+of+centurion.+He+controlled+the+four+lower+Salar+clans%2C+which+had+adopted+the+surname+Ma%2C+and+inhabited+the+region+|title=Gladstone-Gordon correspondence, 1851–1896: selections from the private correspondence of a British Prime Minister and a colonial Governor, Volume 51|author=William Ewart Gladstone, Baron Arthur Hamilton-Gordon Stanmore|year=1961|publisher=American Philosophical Society|page=27|isbn=9780871695147|access-date=2010-06-28}}</ref>

From 1640 to 1724, a big part of the area that is now Qinghai was under [[Khoshut]] Mongol control, but in 1724 it was conquered by the armies of the [[Qing dynasty]].<ref>''The Times Atlas of World History''.

==Geography==
Qinghai is located on the northeastern part of the [[Tibetan Plateau]]. By area, it is the largest province in the People's Republic of China (excluding the [[Autonomous regions of the People's Republic of China|autonomous regions]]).

The [[Yellow River]] originates in the southern part of the province, while the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Mekong]] have their sources in the southwestern part. Qinghai is separated by the [[Riyue Mountain]] into pastoral and agricultural zones in the west and east.<ref name="Cao">{{Cite book|title=Ethnic Minorities and Regional Development in Asia: Reality and Challenges|editor1-first=Huahua|editor1-last=Cao|publisher=Amsterdam University Press|year=2009|chapter=Maximising Opportunities for the Tibetans of Qinghai Province, China|first=Anja|last=Lahtinen|pages=20–22}}</ref>

The [[Sanjiangyuan National Nature Reserve]] is located in Qinghai and contains the headwaters of the [[Yellow River]], [[Yangtze River]], and [[Mekong River]]. The reserve was established to protect the headwaters of these three rivers and consists of 18 subareas, each containing three zones which are managed with differing degrees of strictness.

[[Qinghai Lake]] is the largest salt water lake in China, and the second largest in the world. Other large lakes are [[Lake Hala]] in the [[Qilian Mountains|Qilian mountains]], lakes [[Gyaring Lake|Gyaring]] and [[Ngoring Lake|Ngoring]] in the headwater region of the Yellow River, [[Donggi Cona|Lake Donggi Cona]], and many saline and [[salt lake]]s in the western part of the province.

The [[Qaidam|Qaidam basin]] lies in the northwest part of the province at an altitude between 3000 and 5000 meters above sea level. About a third of this resource rich basin is desert.

==Politics==
{{Main|Politics of Qinghai}}
The Politics of Qinghai Province in the [[People's Republic of China]] are structured in a one party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].

The Governor of Qinghai (青海省省长) is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Qinghai. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Qinghai [[Chinese Communist Party Committee Secretary]] (青海省委书记), colloquially termed the "Qinghai Party Chief".

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main list|List of administrative divisions of Qinghai|List of township-level divisions of Qinghai}}

Because the Han form Qinghai's ethnic majority<ref name="Cao" /> and because none of its many ethnic minorities have clear dominance over the rest, the province is not administered as an autonomous region. Instead, the province has many ethnic autonomous areas at the district and county levels.<ref name="Goodman">{{cite book|title=China's Campaign to "Open Up the West": National, Provincial, and Local Perspectives|first=David|last=Goodman|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|pages=67–83}}</ref> Qinghai is administratively divided into eight [[Administrative divisions of China#Prefectural level|prefecture-level divisions]]: two [[prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] and six [[autonomous prefecture]]s:

Qinghai's economy is amongst the smallest in China. Its [[nominal GDP]] in 2022 was just RMB 361 billion (US$50 billion) and contributes to about 0.30% of the entire country's economy. Per capita GDP was RMB 60,724 (US$9,028) (nominal), the 24th in China.<ref name="data2022">{{cite web|url=https://data.stats.gov.cn/english/easyquery.htm?cn=E0103|title=National Data|publisher=[[National Bureau of Statistics of China]]|date=1 March 2022|access-date=23 March 2022}}</ref>

Its heavy industry includes iron and steel production, located near its capital city of Xining. Oil and natural gas from the [[Qaidam Basin]] have also been an important contributor to the economy.<ref name="thechinaperspective.com">{{Cite web|url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/qinghai-province/|title=Qinghai Province: Economic News and Statistics for Qinghai's Economy|access-date=2011-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045827/http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/qinghai-province/|archive-date=2011-10-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> Salt works operate at many of the province's numerous salt lakes.

Outside of the provincial capital, Xining, most of Qinghai remains underdeveloped. Qinghai ranks second lowest in China in terms of highway length, and will require a significant expansion of its infrastructure to capitalize on the economic potential of its rich natural resources.<ref name="thechinaperspective.com"/>

===Economic and technological development zone===

[[Xining]] Economic & Technological Development Zone (XETDZ) was approved as state-level development zone in July 2000. It has a planned area of 4.4&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. XETDZ lies in the east of Xining, 5&nbsp;km from the city centre. Xining is located in the east of the province at the upper reaches of the [[Huangshui River]], one of the Yellow River's branches. The city is surrounded by mountains with an average elevation of 2261 m, the highest at 4393 m. XETDZ is the first of its kind at the national level on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. It is established to fulfill the nation's strategy of developing the west.

XETDZ enjoys a convenient transportation system, connected by the Xining-Lanzhou expressway and running through by two main roads, the broadest in the city. It is 4&nbsp;km from the railway station, 15&nbsp;km from Xi'ning Airport—a grade 4D airport with 14 airlines to cities such as Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Chengdu and Xi'an. Xining is Qinghai province's passage to the outside world, a transportation hub with more than ten highways, over 100 roads and two railways, Lanzhou-Qinghai and Qinghai-Tibet Railways in and out of the city.

It focuses on the development of following industries: chemicals based on salt lake resources, nonferrous metals, and petroleum and natural gas processing; special medicine, foods and bio-chemicals using local plateau animals and plants; new products involving ecological and environmental protection, high technology, new materials as well as information technology; and services such as logistics, banking, real estate, tourism, hotel, catering, agency and international trade.<ref>[http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/xining-economic-technology-development-zone/ RightSite.asia|Xining Economic & Technological Development Zone]</ref>

===Tourism===
[[File:Qinghailakeerlangjian.png|thumb|300px|View of the [[Qinghai Lake]].]]
Many tourist attractions center on [[Xining]], the provincial seat of Qinghai.

During the hot summer months, many tourists from the hot southern and eastern parts of China travel to Xining, as the climate of Xining in July and August is quite mild and comfortable, making the city an ideal summer retreat.

[[Qinghai Lake]] ({{zh|labels=no|c=青海湖|p=qīnghǎi hú}}) is another tourist attraction, albeit further from Xining than [[Kumbum Monastery]] (Ta'er Si). The lake is the largest saltwater lake in China, and is also located on the "Roof of the World", the Tibetan Plateau. The lake itself lies at 3,600 m elevation. The surrounding area is made up of rolling [[grassland]]s and populated by ethnic Tibetans. Most pre-arranged tours stop at Bird Island ({{zh|labels=no|c=鸟岛|p=niǎo dǎo}}). An international bicycle race takes place annually from Xining to Qinghai Lake.

The [[Lanqing Railway]], running between [[Lanzhou]], [[Gansu]] and [[Xining]], the province's capital, was completed in 1959 and is the major transportation route in and out of the province. A continuation of the line, the [[Qinghai-Tibet Railway]] via [[Golmud]] and western Qinghai, has become one of the most ambitious projects in PRC history. It was completed in October 2005 and now links Tibet with the rest of China through Qinghai.

Construction on the [[Golmud–Dunhuang Railway]], in the province's northwestern part, started in 2012.

Six [[China National Highways|National Highways]] run through the province.

[[Xining Caojiabao International Airport]] provides service to [[Beijing]], [[Lanzhou]], [[Golmud]] and [[Delingha]]. Smaller regional airports, [[Delingha Airport]], [[Golog Maqin Airport]], [[Huatugou Airport]], [[Qilian Airport]] and [[Yushu Batang Airport]], serve the province's smaller communities; plans exist for the construction of three more by 2020.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chinacivilaviation.com/Article.asp?id=844 |title=Qinghai to build 3 new airports before 2020 |access-date=2010-04-25 |archive-date=2012-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724004321/http://www.chinacivilaviation.com/article.asp?id=844 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Telecommunications==
{{see also|Telecommunications industry in China}}

Since the [[Ministry of Industry and Information Technology]] began its "Access to Telephones Project", Qinghai has invested 640 million yuan to provide [[telephone]] access to 3,860 out of its 4,133 administrative villages. At the end of 2006, 299 towns had received [[Internet access]]. However, 6.6 percent of villages in the region still have no access to the telephone. These villages are mainly scattered in [[Qingnan, Qinghai|Qingnan]] Area, with 90 percent of them located in [[Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Yushu]] and [[Golog Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture|Guoluo]]. The average altitude of these areas exceeds 3600 meters, and the poor natural conditions hamper the establishment of [[telecommunication]] facilities in the region.

[[Satellite phone]]s have been provided to 186 remote villages in Qinghai Province as of September 14, 2007.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} The areas benefited were Yushu Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Guoluo Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture. Qinghai has recently been provided with satellite telephone access. In June 2007, [[China Satcom]] carried out an in-depth survey in Yushu and Guoluo, and made a special satellite phones for these areas. Two phones were provided to each village for free, and calls were charged at the rate of 0.2 RMB (about a quarter of a US cent at that time) per minute for both local and national calls, with the extra charges assumed by China Satcom. No monthly rent was charged on the satellite phone. International calls were also available.
