==History==
Yuyao is well known for its rich heritage of civilization. The [[Neolithic]] [[Hemudu culture]] formed in Yuyao about 5,000 B.C. is one of the earliest sites of human civilization on earth. The material and ethical relics revealed large-scale rice plantation and other agricultural activities, hurdle style architecture, paddling and boating and respecting birds and sun.

Yuyao also produced many famous scholars in history—for example, Yan Zi-Ling during the [[Han dynasty]]; [[Yu Fan]] during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period; Yu Xi during the [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Jin dynasty]]; [[Yu Shinan]] during the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties; and [[Wang Yangming]], Zhu Shunshui, and [[Huang Zongxi]] during the [[Ming dynasty]]. Wang Yangming and Huang Zongxi were ranked among China's top 10 ideologists. Yuyao was then named as "the Most Famous County" and "the Famous State on Literature". During the [[Anti-Japanese War]], Yuyao was one of China's 19 bases against Japanese invaders and was the center of anti-Japanese bases of eastern [[Zhejiang]] province.

==Economy==
Yuyao is known as a place for rice and fish. Its economy has been booming as private enterprises dominate after the economic reform began in late 1970s. In 2007, GDP will reach RMB 34 billions, with double digit annual growth rates over the past 20 years. It ranked as one of the top-20 counties in terms of comprehensive economic strength out of all the 2100 counties in China. The industry products are mainly electric appliances, plastic moulding, machinery and textiles. High-tech industries such as materials, optical, electro-mechanical integration and fine chemical industry are developing rapidly. The main agriculture, forestry and animal husbandry products of Yuyao are tea, fruits like waxberry and mandarin orange, bamboo, silkworm, fowl, livestock and fish. Fresh produce is available in all seasons.

==Transport==
The [[Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway]][https://web.archive.org/web/20060706185209/http://www.zjec.com.cn/aa/column/109.htm] and [[China National Highway 329]] and [[Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway]] go through Yuyao. The world's longest trans-oceanic bridge – the {{convert|36|km|abbr=on}} [[Hangzhou Bay Bridge]] – was recently completed construction near the northern border of Yuyao. It reduced the cross bay traffic to only {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} from the current {{convert|420|km|abbr=on}} section of Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Expressway around [[Hangzhou Bay]].
