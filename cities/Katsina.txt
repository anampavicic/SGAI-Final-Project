== History ==
{{Main|History of Katsina}}
Surrounded by city wall {{convert|21|km}} in length, Katsina is believed to have been founded circa 1100.<ref name="britannica" /> In pre-Islamic times, Katsina's semi-divine ruler was known as the ''Sarki'', who faced a summary death-sentence if found to be ruling incompetently. From the 17th to the 18th century, Katsina was the commercial heart of [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausaland]] and became the largest of the seven [[Hausa people|Hausa]] city-states. Katsina was conquered by the [[Fula people|Fulani]] during the [[Fulani War]] in 1807. In 1903, the Emir, Abubakar dan Ibrahim, accepted British rule, which continued until Nigerian independence from Britain in 1960.{{citation needed|date= October 2022}}

The city's history of western-style education dates back to the early 1950s, when the first middle school in northern Nigeria was established ([[Katsina Teachers College]]). There are now several institutions of higher learning, including two universities: [[Umaru Musa Yar'adua University]] and the private [[Katsina University|Alqalam University]], a polytechnic [[Hassan Usman Katsina Polytechnic]] and a [[Federal College of Education, Katsina]]. The city of Katsina is also home to an 18th-century mosque featuring the [[Gobarau Minaret]], a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=on|order=flip}} tower made from mud and palm branches.<ref name="britannica" />

=== Katsina Emirate ===
[[File:Image of emirs palace katsina.jpg|alt=Emirs palace entrance|thumb|Katsina Emirate "Gidan Korau"|left]]The Katsina Royal Palace, known as Gidan Korau, is a huge complex located in the centre of the ancient city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Emirs Palace Katsina State :: Nigeria Information & Guide |url=https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Nigeria/States_Nigeria/Katsina/Emirs-Palace-Katsina.html |access-date=22 October 2023|website=nigeriagalleria.com}}</ref> It is a symbol of culture, history and traditions of 'Katsinawa'. According to historical account, it was built in 1348 [[Common Era|CE]] by Muhammadu Korau, who is believed to have been the first [[Muslim]] King of Katsina. This explains why it is traditionally known as 'Gidan Korau' (House of Korau). It is one of the oldest and among the first generation palaces, along with [[Daura]], [[Kano (city)|Kano]] and [[Zazzau]]. The palace was encircled with a rampart, 'Ganuwar Gidan Sarki' (which is now gone). The main gate which leads to the palace is known as 'Kofar Soro', while the gate at the backyard is called 'Kofar Bai' (now gone). The Emir's residential quarters at the epicenter of the Palace is a large compound built in the typical traditional architectural style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.katsinaemirate.org/|title=KATSINA EMIRATE COUNCIL|access-date=6 August 2015|archive-date=14 November 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114170909/http://www.katsinaemirate.org/earlykt.htm|url-status=dead}}.
