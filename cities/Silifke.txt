'''Silifke''', anciently '''Seleucia''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Σελευκεία)''',''' is a municipality and [[Districts of Turkey|district]] of [[Mersin Province]], [[Turkey]].<ref>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx Büyükşehir İlçe Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 12 July 2023.</ref> Its area is 2,692&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.harita.gov.tr/uploads/files-folder/il_ilce_alanlari.xlsx|title=İl ve İlçe Yüz ölçümleri|publisher=General Directorate of Mapping|access-date=12 July 2023}}</ref> and its population is 132,665 (2022).<ref name=tuik>{{Cite web |title=Address-based population registration system (ADNKS) results dated 31 December 2022, Favorite Reports|url=https://biruni.tuik.gov.tr/medas/?kn=95&locale=en |access-date=12 July 2023|publisher=[[TÜİK]]|language=en|format=XLS}}</ref> It is {{convert|80|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of the city of [[Mersin]], on the west end of the [[Çukurova]] plain.

Silifke lies on the [[Göksu River]], the ancient Calycadnus, near its outlet into the [[Mediterranean]]. The river flows from the nearby [[Taurus Mountains]] and the city is surrounded by attractive countryside along its banks.

{{anchor|Etymology|Toponymy|Name}}
==Names==
[[Turkish language|Turkish]] {{lang|tr|Silifke}} ({{IPA|tr|siˈlifce|lang}}) derives from [[Byzantine Greek language|Greek]] ''Seléfkeia'' ({{lang|el|Σελεύκεια}}, {{IPA|el|seˈlefci.a|label=modern pronunciation:}}), the late medieval and modern form of [[ancient Greek language|ancient Greek]] ''Seleúkeia'' ({{lang|grc|{{linktext|Σελεύκεια}}}}; {{langx|la|Seleucia}}), named for its founder [[Seleucus I Nicator]], [[kings of the Seleucid Empire|king]] of the [[Seleucid Empire]]. It was distinguished from the [[Seleucia (disambiguation)|many other places of that name]] as '''Seleucia on the [[Calycadnus]]''' ({{lang|la|Seleucia ad Calycadnum}}), '''Seleucia in [[Cilicia]]''', '''Seleucia in [[Isauria]]''', '''Seleucia [[Cilicia Trachea|Trachea]]''', and '''Seleucia [[Cilicia Trachea|Tracheotis]]'''.<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Seleucia |volume=24 |page=603}}</ref>

The site of the ancient city of [[Olba (ancient city)|Olba]] ({{langx|tr|Oura|links=no}}) is also within the boundaries of modern-day Silifke.

==History==

===Antiquity===
Located a few miles from the mouth of the [[Göksu]] River, Seleucia was founded by [[Seleucus I Nicator]] in the early 3rd century BC, one of several cities he named after himself. It is probable that there were already towns called [[Olba (ancient city)|Olbia (or Olba)]] and [[Hyria (Silicia)|Hyria]] and that Seleucus I merely united them giving them his name. The city grew to include the nearby settlement of [[Holmi]] (in modern-day [[Taşucu]]) which had been established earlier as an [[Ionia]]n colony but being on the coast was vulnerable to raiders and pirates.<ref>[[Stephanus of Byzantium]]; [[Strabo]], XIV, 670)</ref>  The new city up river was doubtless seen as safer against attacks from the sea so Seleucia achieved considerable commercial prosperity as a port for this corner of [[Cilicia]] (later named [[Isauria]]), and was even a rival of [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]].<ref name=EB1911/>

Cilicia thrived as a province of the [[Roman Empire|Romans]], and Seleucia became a religious center with a renowned 2nd century [[Temple]] of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]]. It was also the site of a noted school of [[philosophy]] and [[literature]], the birthplace of [[Peripatetic school|peripatetic]]s [[Athenaeus of Seleucia|Athenaeus]] and [[Xenarchus of Seleucia|Xenarchus]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/gazetteer/0314.html |title=Classical Gazetteer, page 312<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2006-02-26 |archive-date=2012-12-04 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121204190829/http://www.ancientlibrary.com/gazetteer/0314.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Silifke Bridge|stone bridge]] was built by the governor L. Octavius Memor in 77 AD. Around 300 AD [[Isauria]] was established as an independent state with Seleucia as the capital.

===Christianity===
Early [[Christianity|Christian]] [[bishop]]s held a [[Council of Seleucia]] in<ref>(variously cited)</ref> 325, 359, and 410.  Seleucia was famous for the tomb of the virgin Saint [[Acts of Paul and Thecla|Thecla of Iconium]], converted by [[Paul of Tarsus|Saint Paul]], who died at Seleucia,<ref>''[[Acts of Paul and Thecla|Acta Pauli et Theclae]]'', an [[apocryphal]] work of the 2nd century</ref> the tomb was one of the most celebrated in the Christian world and was restored several times, among others by the Emperor [[Zeno (emperor)|Zeno]] in the 5th century, and today the ruins of the tomb and sanctuary are called ''Meriamlik''.<ref>(''Denkschriften der k. Akadem. der Wissenschaft. philos.-histor. Klasse'', Vienna, XLIV, 6, 105-08)</ref> In the 5th century the imperial governor (''comes Isauriae'') in residence at Seleucia had two [[Roman legion|legions]] at his disposal, the [[Legio II Isaura]] and the [[Legio III Isaura]]. From this period, and perhaps later, dates the Christian [[necropolis]], west of the town, which contains many tombs of Christian soldiers.<ref name="edwards">{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W., "Seleukeia (Cilicia)" |title=The Eerdmans Encyclopedia of Early Christian Art and Archaeology, ed., Paul Corby Finney |date=2016 |publisher=William B. Eerdmans Publishing| location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |isbn=978-0-8028-9017-7| pages=491}}</ref> According to the ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum|Notitia Episcopatuum]]'' of the [[Patriarchate of Antioch]], in the 6th century, the [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of Seleucia had twenty-four suffragan sees.<ref>(Echoes d'Orient, X, 145)</ref>

[[File:Seal of Paul, Metropolitan of Seleucia, 8th-9th centuries.jpg|thumb|right|Lead seal of Paul, Metropolitan of Seleucia (8th/9th century)]]
In 705 Seleucia was captured by the Arab armies of Islam and was recovered by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. Thus by 732 nearly all the [[ecclesiastical province]] of Isauria was incorporated into the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]]; henceforth the province figures in the ''Notitiae'' of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]], but under the name of ''[[Pamphylia]]''.

In the ''Notitiae'' of [[Leo VI the Wise]] (ca. 900) Seleucia had 22 suffragan bishoprics;<ref>[[Heinrich Gelzer]], ''Ungedruckte . . . Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum'', 557.</ref> in that of [[Constantine Porphyrogenitus]] (ca 940) it had 23.<ref>(''Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani'', ed. Gelzer, 76)</ref> In 968 Antioch again fell into the power of the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], and with the Province of Isauria, Seleucia was allocated to the [[Patriarchate of Antioch]].<ref>(Gelzer, op. cit., 573)</ref> We know of several metropolitans of this see, the first of whom, [[Agapetus of Seleucia|Agapetus]], attended the [[First Council of Nicaea|Council of Nicaea]] in 325; [[Neonas of Seleucia|Neonas]] was at the Council of Seleucia in 359; [[Symposius of Seleucia|Symposius]] at the [[First Council of Constantinople|Council of Constantinople]] in 381; [[Dexianus of Seleucia|Dexianus]] at the [[First Council of Ephesus|Council of Ephesus]] in 431; [[Basil of Seleucia|Basil]], a celebrated orator and writer, whose conduct was rather ambiguous at the [[Second Council of Ephesus]] and at the beginning of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451; [[Theodore of Seleucia|Theodore]] was at the [[Fifth Ecumenical Council]] in 553; [[Macrobius of Seleucia|Macrobius]] at the [[Sixth Ecumenical Council]] and the [[Council in Trullo]] in 692.

No longer a residential see, Seleucia in Isauria has been included in the list of [[titular see]]s of the [[Catholic Church]], which has made no new appointments of a [[titular bishop]] to this eastern see since the [[Second Vatican Council]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana, 2013, {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 968.</ref>

===Turkish period===
In the 11th century, the city was captured by the [[Seljuk Turks]]; they met with resistance and in 1137, Seleucia was besieged by [[Leo I, Prince of Armenia|Leon]] of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|Cilician Armenia]]. During this period of struggle between Armenians, Byzantines, Crusaders, and Turks, a stronghold was built on the heights overlooking the city. On June 10, 1190, the Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] was drowned trying to cross the Calycadnus,<ref name=EB1911/> near Seleucia during the [[Third Crusade]].

In the 13th century Seleucia was in the possession of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]], who lost it to the [[Karamanids|Karamanid]] Principality in the second half of the 13th century, and then it ended up in the hands of the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] under general [[Gedik Ahmet Pasha]] in 1471.

Until 1933, Silifke was the capital of İçel Province, but then, [[Mersin Province|İçel and Mersin provinces]] were merged. The merged province took the name of İçel but with its administrative centre at [[Mersin]]. Finally in 2002 the name of İçel was replaced with that of Mersin.

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2024}}
The economy of the district depends on agriculture, tourism and raising livestock. The town of Silifke is as a market for the coastal plain, which produces beans, peanuts, sesame, banana, orange, lemon, cotton, grapes, lentils, olives, tobacco, and canned fruits and vegetables. An irrigation project located at Silifke supplies the fertile [[Göksu Delta]]. In recent years there has been a large investment in glasshouses for producing strawberries and other fruit and vegetables in the winter season.

Silifke is also an industrial town, well-connected with other urban areas and producing beverages, chemicals, clothes, footwear, glass, plastics, pottery, and textiles.

==Climate==
Silifke has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa'') with hot and dry summers and mild and wet winters.
