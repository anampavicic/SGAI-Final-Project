'''Amur Oblast''' ({{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|m|ʊə|_|ˈ|ɒ|b|l|æ|s|t}}){{efn|{{lang-rus|Амурская область|Amúrskaya óblast}}, {{IPA|ru|ɐˈmurskəjə ˈobɫəsʲtʲ|IPA}}}} is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]), located on the banks of the [[Amur]] and [[Zeya (river)|Zeya]] rivers in the [[Russian Far East]]. The oblast borders [[Heilongjiang]] province of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC) to the south.

The [[administrative center]] of the oblast, the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Blagoveshchensk]], is one of the oldest settlements in the far east of the country, founded in 1856. It is a traditional center of trade and [[gold mining]]. The territory is accessed by two railways: the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and the [[Baikal–Amur Mainline]]. As of the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]], the oblast's population was&nbsp;766,912.<ref name="2021Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref>

==Names==
''Amur Krai'' ({{lang|ru|Аму́рский край}}) or ''Priamurye'' ({{lang|ru|Приаму́рье}} 'Circum-Amur') were unofficial names for the Russian territories by the [[Amur River]] used in the late [[Russian Empire]] that approximately correspond to modern Amur Oblast.

==Geography==
Amur Oblast is located in the southeast of Russia, between [[Stanovoy Range]] in the north and the [[Amur River]] in the south, and borders with the [[Sakha Republic]] in the north, [[Khabarovsk Krai]] and the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] in the east, [[Heilongjiang]] of China in the south, and with [[Zabaykalsky Krai]] in the west. The [[Stanovoy Range]] forms the dividing line between the Sakha Republic and Amur Oblast and spreads across the oblast's entire northern border. The [[Amur–Zeya Plain|Amur–Zeya]] and [[Zeya–Bureya Plain]]s cover about 40% of the oblast's territory, but the rest is hilly. Several mountain ranges rise to the south of Stanovoy Range, including the [[Selemdzha Range]] parallel to it, as well as the [[Ezop Range|Ezop]], [[Yam-Alin]] and the [[Turan Range|Turan]] ranges stretching along the oblast's southeastern border with Khabarovsk Krai.<ref name="GЕ">[[Google Earth]]</ref>

Many rivers flow through the oblast, especially in the north, accounting for 75% of the [[hydropower]] resources in the [[Russian Far East]]. Most of the oblast is in the Amur's [[drainage basin]], although the rivers in the northwest drain into the [[Lena River|Lena]] and the rivers in the northeast drain into the [[Uda River (Khabarovsk Krai)|Uda]]. The longest rivers include the Amur, [[Bureya River|Bureya]], [[Gilyuy River|Gilyuy]], [[Nyukzha River|Nyukzha]], [[Olyokma River|Olyokma]], [[Selemdzha River|Selemdzha]], and [[Zeya River|Zeya]]. The Zeya begins in the mountains in the northeast, and its middle reaches are dammed to create the huge [[Zeya Dam|Zeya Reservoir]], which sprawls over {{convert|2400|km2|sp=us}}.

Climate is temperate continental, with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers. Average January temperatures vary from {{convert|-24|C}} in the south to {{convert|-33|C}} in the north. Average July temperatures are {{convert|+21|C}} in the south and {{convert|+18|C}} in the north. Annual [[precipitation]] is about {{convert|850|mm|sp=us}}.

Dwarf Siberian pine and [[alpine tundra]] grow at higher elevations and [[larch]] forests with small stands of flat-leaved [[birch]] and [[pine]] forests grow alongside the river plains. These larch and [[fir]]-[[spruce]] forests form the watershed of the Selemdzha River. The Bureya and Arkhara Rivers, southeast of the Selemdza, have the richest remaining forests in the oblast with [[Pinus koraiensis|Korean pine]], [[Schisandra chinensis]], [[Quercus mongolica|Mongolian Oak]], and other Manchurian flora. The Zeya–Bureya Plain, located between the Zeya, Amur, and Bureya Rivers, has the highest biodiversity in Amur Oblast. Much of this plain has been burned for agriculture, but large patches still remain. Japanese Daurian and Far Eastern western cranes nest here, as well as a host of other rare birds.

===Natural resources===
Amur Oblast has considerable reserves of many types of mineral resources; proven reserves are estimated to be worth US$400&nbsp;billion. Among the most important are gold (the largest reserves in Russia), silver, [[titanium]], [[molybdenum]], [[tungsten]], copper, and [[tin]]. There are also an estimated 70 billion tons of [[bituminous coal]] and [[lignite]] reserves. Probable iron deposits are estimated to be 3.8&nbsp;billion tons. The Garin deposit is fully explored and known to contain 389&nbsp;million tons of iron ore. Estimated reserves of the deposit are 1,293&nbsp;million tons. The deposit's ore contains a low concentration of detrimental impurities; the ore contains 69.9% iron. Amur Oblast is also a promising source of [[titanium]], with the Bolshoy Seyim deposit being the most important.<ref name="AllRegions">{{cite book|title=Russia: All Regions Trade & Investment Guide |publisher=CTEC Publishing LLC |year=2008 |chapter=Amur Region |url=http://www.russiasregions.com/79%20Amur%20Region.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715214750/http://www.russiasregions.com/79%20Amur%20Region.pdf |archive-date=July 15, 2011 }}</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
According to the ''Bei Shi'' (Dynastic History of Northern Dynasties) and the ''Sui Shu'' (Chronicles of the [[Sui dynasty]]), both Chinese records, this area belonged originally to the territory one of the five semi-[[nomad]]ic [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]], the Bo Shiwei tribes ({{zh|c=钵室韋}}). Their settlements were located on the north of the Yilehuli Mountains in the upper reaches of the [[Nen River]], south of the [[Stanovoy Range]], west of the [[Bureya Range|Bureya]] and the [[Malyi Khingan]] ranges and reaching the [[Okhotsk Sea]] on the northeast. They brought tributary presents to the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] court and disappeared at the dawn of the tenth century with the foundation of the [[Liao Dynasty|Liao]] empire.

Later, in the 13th century, the middle-[[Amur River|Amur]] and the [[Zeya River]] basin area became the homeland of the [[Daur people|Daurs]] and (further south) the [[Ducher]]s. The ancestors of the Daurs are thought to be closely related to the [[Khitan people|Khitans]] and the [[Mongols]], while the Duchers may have been a branch of the [[Jurchen people]], later known as the [[Manchus]].

The area was conquered by the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] in 1639–1640, after defeating the [[Evenks|Evenk]] Federation led by [[Bombogor (Evenk chief)|Bombogor]]. It was returned to the [[Qing dynasty]] in the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] with the [[Tsardom of Russia]].

===Russian Empire===
The region was [[Amur Annexation|annexed]] by Russia in 1858 in the [[Treaty of Aigun]] between Russia and the Qing dynasty. [[Amur Oblast (Russian Empire)|Amur Oblast]] was established with its center in [[Blagoveshchensk]].<ref>[http://archive.predistoria.org/index.php?name=Pages&op=page&pid=8 Military Governors of the Amur Oblast. Part II]</ref>

The region received its first influx of Russian settlers in the mid-seventeenth century. They were looking for a more temperate climate as an escape from the north. After the [[Opium War]], when the Chinese Empire was exposed to the outside world, Russian explorers once again moved to the region (mostly Cossacks and peasant farmers). The last influx of people arrived upon the completion of the [[Trans-Siberian Railroad]].

===Modern history===
In April 1920, the [[Far Eastern Republic]], with its capital in Chita, was formed from Amur, Transbaikal, [[Kamchatka]], [[Sakhalin]], and Primorye regions as a democratic "buffer" state in order to avoid war with Japan. It existed until November 1922, when it joined the [[Russian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Russian SFSR]].

In January 1926, the territory of Amur Oblast was split between the East Siberian Krai and the [[Far Eastern Krai]]. The [[East Siberian Oblast]] was divided into [[Irkutsk Oblast]] and [[Chita Oblast]] in 1937 and the part of Amur within it became part of Chita Oblast. The Far Eastern Krai was divided into [[Khabarovsk Krai]] and [[Primorsky Krai|Primorye Krai]] in 1938. The territory of Amur Oblast that was in Far Eastern Krai was included in [[Khabarovsk Krai]].

In 1948, Amur Oblast was finally separated from Khabarovsk Krai and Chita Oblast to become an independent region of the RSFSR. Rapid economic growth based on gold production began at that time, and living standards improved with the arrival of young specialists. As the Far Eastern District expanded, the demand for services such as electric power and [[House|housing]] also increased, which stimulated a new round of construction projects. New cities were built, along with the [[Zeya Hydroelectric Power Plant]] (Zeiskaya GES), which still supplies electricity to most of the Far Eastern District.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kommersant.com/p-34/r_377/Amur_Region/ |title=Amur Region |publisher=Kommersant.com |access-date=2013-08-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013034609/http://www.kommersant.com/p-34/r_377/Amur_Region/ |archive-date=October 13, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On 21 May 1998 Amur alongside [[Ivanovo Oblast|Ivanovo]], [[Kostroma Oblast|Kostroma]], [[Voronezh Oblast]], and the [[Mari El|Mari El Republic]] signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy.<ref name= "newsline2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/1141661.html|title=Newsline - May 22, 1998 Yeltsin Signs More Power-Sharing Agreements with Regions|website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=June 20, 2008 |language=en|access-date=2019-05-02}}</ref> This agreement would be abolished on 18 March 2002.<ref name= "demokratiztsiya">{{Cite journal|last=Chuman|first=Mizuki|title=The Rise and Fall of Power-Sharing Treaties Between Center and Regions in Post-Soviet Russia|url=http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf|journal=Demokratizatsiya|pages=146|access-date=May 3, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190308002915/http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf|archive-date=March 8, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Agriculture===
The Amur Region is the primary producer of [[soybean]] in Russia. By 1940, 65 thousand hectares of land in Amur had been cultivated with soybeans, and by 1972 soybean made up 592 thousand hectares of land in Amur, compared to 650 thousand hectares of soybean crops in the whole of the USSR. During the Soviet period, this made up a significant proportion of the economy of Far Eastern Russia.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boiarskaia |first1=A I |last2=Hasegawa |first2=H |last3=Boiarskii |first3=B S |last4=Lyude |first4=A V |title=History of development of Soybean Production in the Amur Region and Far East District in the USSR |journal=IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science |date=2 September 2020 |volume=548 |issue=2 |pages=022079 |doi=10.1088/1755-1315/548/2/022079 |bibcode=2020E&ES..548b2079B |issn=1755-1315|doi-access=free }}</ref> By 2019, the Amur Region's share of Russian soybean production had declined to 28 percent due to increased cultivation of soybean in other regions, though it still remains Russia's largest soybean producer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Selikhova |first1=O A |last2=Tikhonchuk |first2=P V |title=Problems of rational varietal placement of soybean in the Amur region |journal=IOP Conference Series: Earth and Environmental Science |date=5 August 2020 |volume=547 |issue=1 |pages=012033 |doi=10.1088/1755-1315/547/1/012033|bibcode=2020E&ES..547a2033S |doi-access=free }}</ref> The region in 2019 produced approximately 1 million tonnes of soybean, many of which are exported to neighboring China.
