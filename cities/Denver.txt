In the summer of 1858, during the [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]], a group of gold prospectors from [[Lawrence, Kansas]], established [[Montana City, Colorado|Montana City]] as a [[mining town]] on the banks of the [[South Platte River]] in what was then western [[Kansas Territory]], on traditional lands of [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]]. This was the first historical settlement in what later became the city of Denver. But the site faded quickly, and by the summer of 1859 it was abandoned in favor of [[Auraria, Denver|Auraria]] (named after the gold-mining town of [[Auraria, Georgia]]) and St. Charles City.<ref>{{cite web|date=January 1, 2006 |title=Denver: The Rocky Mountain metropolis timeline |publisher=The City and County of Denver |url=http://www.denvergov.org/aboutdenver/history_timeline.asp |access-date=August 30, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813180204/http://www.denvergov.org/aboutdenver/history_timeline.asp |archive-date=August 13, 2006 }}

The location was accessible to existing trails and was across the South Platte River from the site of seasonal encampments of the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]].

Larimer, along with associates in the St. Charles City Land Company, sold parcels in the town to merchants and miners, with the intention of creating a major city that would cater to new immigrants. Denver City was a frontier town, with an economy based on servicing local miners with gambling, saloons, livestock, and goods trading. In the early years, land parcels were often traded for grubstakes or gambled away by miners in Auraria.<ref name="DenverHistArapaho"/> In May 1859, Denver City residents donated 53 lots to the Leavenworth & Pike's Peak Express in order to secure the region's first overland wagon route. Offering daily service for "passengers, mail, freight, and gold", the Express reached Denver on a trail that trimmed westward travel time from twelve days to six. In 1863, [[Western Union]] furthered Denver's dominance of the region by choosing the city for its regional terminus.

On February 18, 1861, six chiefs of the Southern Cheyenne and four of the Arapaho signed the [[Treaty of Fort Wise]] with the United States<ref name="fortwisetreaty">"Treaty with the Arapaho and Cheyenne, 1861" (Treaty of Fort Wise). 12 Stat. 1163, p. 810.</ref> at [[Bent's New Fort]] at [[Big Timbers]] near what is now [[Lamar, Colorado]]. They ceded more than 90 percent of the lands designated for them by the Fort Laramie Treaty, including the area of modern Denver.<ref name="greene-2"/> Some Cheyennes opposed to the treaty, saying that it had been signed by a small minority of the chiefs without the consent or approval of the rest of the tribe, that the signatories had not understood what they signed, and that they had been bribed to sign by a large distribution of gifts. The territorial government of Colorado, however, claimed the treaty was a "solemn obligation" and considered that those Indians who refused to abide by it were hostile and planning a war.<ref name="hyde">''Life of George Bent: Written From His Letters'', by George E.

This disagreement on the validity of [[Treaty of Fort Wise]] escalated to bring about the [[Colorado War]] of 1864 and 1865, during which the brutal [[Sand Creek massacre]] against [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] peoples occurred. The aftermath of the war was the dissolution of the reservation in Eastern Colorado, the signing of [[Medicine Lodge Treaty]] which stipulated that the [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] peoples would be relocated outside of their traditional territory. This treaty term was achieved, even though the treaty was not legally ratified by the tribal members, as per the treaty's own terms. Thus, by the end of 1860s, this effectively and completely cleared the Denver area of its indigenous inhabitants.<ref name="greene-2"/><ref>Magazine, Smithsonian.

Although by the close of the 1860s Denver residents could look with pride at their success establishing a vibrant supply and service center, the decision to route the nation's first transcontinental railroad through [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne City]], rather than Denver, threatened the prosperity of the young town. The transcontinental railroad passed a daunting {{convert|100|mi|km|-1|abbr=off|sp=us}} away, but citizens mobilized to build a railroad to connect Denver to it. Spearheaded by visionary leaders, including Territorial Governor [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]], [[David Moffat]], and [[Walter Cheesman]], fundraising began. Within three days, $300,000 had been raised, and citizens were optimistic. Fundraising stalled before enough was raised, forcing these visionary leaders to take control of the debt-ridden railroad. Despite challenges, on June 24, 1870, citizens cheered as the [[Denver Pacific]] completed the link to the transcontinental railroad, ushering in a new age of prosperity for Denver.<ref>Baker, Gayle, ''Denver'', HarborTown Histories. Santa Barbara, California, p. 31-33, {{ISBN|9780971098442}} (print), 9780987903860 (on-line)</ref>

Finally linked to the rest of the nation by rail, Denver prospered as a service and supply center. The young city grew during these years, attracting millionaires with their mansions, as well as a mixture of crime and poverty of a rapidly growing city. Denver citizens were proud when the rich chose Denver and were thrilled when [[Horace Tabor]], the Leadville mining millionaire, built a business block at 16th and Larimer, as well as the elegant Tabor Grand Opera House. Luxurious hotels, including the much-loved [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]], soon followed, as well as splendid homes for millionaires, such as the Croke, Patterson, Campbell Mansion at 11th and Pennsylvania and the now-demolished Moffat Mansion at 8th and Grant.<ref>Baker, p. 39-48</ref> Intent on transforming Denver into one of the world's great cities, leaders wooed industry and attracted laborers to work in these factories.

Soon, in addition to the elite and a large middle class, Denver had a growing population of immigrant German, Italian, and Chinese laborers, soon followed by African Americans from the Deep South and Hispanic workers. The influx of the new residents strained available housing. In addition, the Silver Crash of 1893 unsettled political, social, and economic balances. Competition among the different ethnic groups was often expressed as bigotry, and social tensions gave rise to the [[Red Scare]]. Americans were suspicious of immigrants, who were sometimes allied with socialist and labor union causes. After World War I, a revival of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] attracted white, native-born Americans who were anxious about the many changes in society. Unlike the earlier organization that was active in the rural South, KKK chapters developed in urban areas of the Midwest and West, including Denver, and into Idaho and Oregon. Corruption and crime also developed in Denver.<ref>Baker, p. 51-55</ref>

Between 1880 and 1895, the city underwent a huge rise in corruption, as crime bosses, such as [[Soapy Smith]], worked side by side with elected officials and the police to control elections, gambling, and [[Lou Blonger|bunco gangs]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.soapysmith.net|title=Information from The Soapy Smith Preservation Trust website|access-date=October 29, 2006}}</ref> The city also suffered a [[Denver Depression of 1893|depression in 1893]] after the crash of silver prices. In 1887, the precursor to the international charity [[United Way of America|United Way]] was formed in Denver by local religious leaders, who raised funds and coordinated various charities to help Denver's poor.<ref>[http://national.unitedway.org/about/history.cfm United Way History] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117060231/http://national.unitedway.org/about/history.cfm |date=January 17, 2010 }}.

A bill proposing a state constitutional amendment to allow [[home rule]] for Denver and other municipalities was introduced in the legislature in 1901 and passed. The measure called for a statewide referendum, which voters approved in 1902. On December 1 that year, Governor [[James Orman]] proclaimed the amendment part of the state's fundamental law.

From 1953 to 1989, the [[Rocky Flats Plant]], a [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]] nuclear weapon facility that was about 15 miles from Denver, produced [[fissile]] [[plutonium]] "[[pit (nuclear weapon)|pits]]" for [[nuclear warhead]]s.

Denver is in the center of the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]], between the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the west and the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] to the east. Its topography consists of plains in the city center with hilly areas to the north, west, and south. At the [[2020 United States census]], the City and County of Denver had an area of {{convert|400.739|km2|acre|order=flip}}, including {{convert|4.276|km2|acre|order=flip}} of water.<ref name=2020_Census/> The City and County of Denver is surrounded by three other counties: [[Adams County, Colorado|Adams County]] to the north and east, [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]] to the south and east, and [[Jefferson County, Colorado|Jefferson County]] to the west.

Denver's nickname is the "Mile-High City", as its official elevation is {{convert|1|mi|ft m|0|spell=in}} above sea level, defined by the elevation of the spot of a benchmark on the steps of the State Capitol building. The elevation of the entire city ranges from {{convert|5130|to|5690|ft|m}}.

Denver features a [[continental semi-arid climate]] (Köppen climate classification: ''BSk'') with generally low humidity and around 3,100 hours of sunshine per year, although humid [[microclimate]]s can be found nearby depending on exact location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-united-states.php|title=Interactive United States Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification Map|website=www.plantmaps.com|access-date=December 19, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://people.eng.unimelb.edu.au/mpeel/koppen.html|title=Updated Köppen-Geiger climate map of the world|website=people.eng.unimelb.edu.au|access-date=December 19, 2018}}</ref> It has four distinct seasons and receives most of its precipitation from April through August.

[[Tornado]]es are rare west of the I-25 corridor; one notable exception was an [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado that struck {{convert|4.4|mi|km}} south of downtown on June 15, 1988. On the other hand, the suburbs east of Denver and the city's east-northeastern extension ([[Denver International Airport]]) can see a few tornadoes, often weak [[landspout]] tornadoes, each spring and summer, especially during June, with the enhancement of the [[Denver Convergence Vorticity Zone]] (DCVZ).

Denver's official weather station is at Denver International Airport, roughly {{convert|20|mi}} from downtown. A 2019 analysis showed the average temperature at Denver International Airport, {{convert|50.2|°F|0}}, was significantly cooler than downtown, {{convert|53.0|°F|0}}.

The Denver [[Metropolitan statistical area|MSA]] has a gross metropolitan product of $157.6 billion in 2010, making it the 18th largest metro economy in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gross Metropolitan Product|url=http://greyhill.com/gross-metropolitan-product|publisher=Greyhill Advisors|access-date=September 29, 2011}}</ref> Denver's economy is based partially on its geographic position and its connection to some of the country's major transportation systems. Because Denver is the largest city within {{convert|500|mi|km|-2}}, it has become a natural location for storage and distribution of goods and services to the [[Mountain States]], [[Southwestern United States|Southwest states]], as well as all [[Western United States|western states]]. Another benefit for distribution is that Denver is nearly equidistant from large cities of the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]], such as Chicago and [[St. Louis]] and some large cities of the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]], such as Los Angeles and San Francisco.

Over the years, the city has been home to other large corporations in the central United States, making Denver a key trade point for the country. Several well-known companies originated in or have relocated to Denver. William Ainsworth opened the Denver Instrument Company in 1895 to make analytical balances for gold assayers. Its factory is now in [[Arvada, Colorado|Arvada]]. [[Aimco]] is headquartered in Denver. [[Samsonite]] began in Denver in 1910 as Shwayder Trunk Manufacturing Company, but Samsonite closed its NE Denver factory in 2001, and moved its headquarters to [[Massachusetts]] after a change of ownership in 2006. [[Qwest Corporation]], founded in Denver in 1911 as Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Company, is now a part of [[Lumen Technologies]] (previously [[CenturyLink]]).

On October 31, 1937, [[Continental Airlines]], now [[United Airlines]], moved its headquarters to [[Stapleton Airport]] in Denver, Colorado (before United Airlines later moved to its current home in [[Chicago]]). [[Robert F. Six]] arranged to have the headquarters moved to Denver from El Paso, Texas because Six believed that the airline should have its headquarters in a large city with a potential base of customers. Continental later moved to [[Houston]] from Denver, but merged with United Airlines in 2013. Throughout that time, the company held a large employee base in the Denver area, which is home to the United Airlines Flight Training Center in the [[Central Park, Denver|Central Park]] neighborhood. [[MediaNews Group]] purchased the ''[[Denver Post]]'' in 1987; the company is based in Denver. The [[Gates Corporation]], the world's largest producer of automotive belts and hoses, was established in S. Denver in 1919. [[Russell Stover Candies]] made its first chocolate candy in Denver in 1923, but moved to Kansas City in 1969. The original [[Frontier Airlines (1950–1986)|Frontier Airlines]] began operations at Denver's old [[Stapleton International Airport]] in 1950; [[Frontier Airlines|Frontier]] was reincarnated at [[Denver International Airport|DIA]] in 1994.

Scott's Liquid Gold, Inc., has been making furniture polish in Denver since 1954. [[Village Inn]] restaurants began as a single pancake house in Denver in 1958. [[Big O Tires]], LLC, of [[Centennial, Colorado|Centennial]] opened its first franchise in 1962 in Denver. The [[Shane Company]] sold its first diamond jewelry in 1971 in Denver. In 1973 [[Re/Max]] made Denver its headquarters. [[Johns-Manville|Johns Manville]] Corp., a manufacturer of insulation and roofing products, relocated its headquarters to Denver from New York in 1972. [[CH2M Hill]], an engineering and construction firm, relocated from Oregon to the [[Denver Technological Center]] in 1980. The [[Ball Corporation]] sold its glass business in Indiana in the 1990s and moved to suburban [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]]; Ball has several operations in greater Denver.

[[Molson Coors Brewing Company]] established its U.S. headquarters in Denver in 2005, but announced its departure in 2019. Its subsidiary and regional [[wholesale]] distributor, Coors Distributing Company, is in NW Denver. The [[Newmont Mining Corporation]], the second-largest gold producer in North America and one of the largest in the world, is headquartered in Denver. [[MapQuest]], an online site for maps, directions and business listings, is headquartered in Denver's LoDo district.

Large Denver-area employers that have headquarters elsewhere include [[Lockheed Martin]] Corp., [[United Airlines]], [[Kroger]] Co. and [[Xcel Energy]], Inc.
[[File:Union Station Development.jpg|thumb|Development in the bustling Union Station section of downtown]]
Geography also allows Denver to have a considerable government presence, with many federal agencies based or having offices in the Denver area. Along with federal agencies come many companies based on US defense and space projects, and more jobs are brought to the city by virtue of its being the capital of the state of [[Colorado]]. The Denver area is home to the former nuclear weapons plant [[Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats]], the [[Denver Federal Center]], [[Byron G. Rogers Federal Building and United States Courthouse]], the [[Denver Mint]], and the [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]].

In 2005, a $310.7 million expansion of the [[Colorado Convention Center]] was completed, doubling its size. The hope was the center's expansion would elevate the city to one of the top 10 cities in the nation for holding a convention.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2005/05/20/finally-its-built-now-for-the-test/ |title=Finally, it's built.

Denver's position near the mineral-rich [[Rocky Mountains]] encouraged mining and energy companies to spring up in the area. In the early days of the city, gold and silver booms and busts played a large role in the city's economic success. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the energy crisis in America and resulting high oil prices created an energy boom in Denver captured in the soap opera ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''. Denver was built up considerably during this time with the construction of many new downtown skyscrapers. When the price of oil dropped from $34 a barrel in 1981 to $9 a barrel in 1986, the Denver economy also dropped, leaving almost 15,000 oil industry workers in the area unemployed (including former mayor and governor [[John Hickenlooper]], a former geologist), and the nation's highest office vacancy rate (30%).<ref>{{cite web |title=Denver: The Rocky Mountain Metropolis History |url=http://www.denvergov.org/aboutdenver/history_timeline_short.asp |date=2002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060608124619/http://www.denvergov.org/AboutDenver/history_timeline_short.asp |archive-date=June 8, 2006 |publisher=The City and County of Denver |access-date=February 27, 2016}}</ref> The industry has recovered and the region has 700 employed petroleum engineers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.collegedegreereport.com/city-data/petroleum-engineers/denver-aurora |title=Welcome collegedegreereport.com – BlueHost.com |publisher=Collegedegreereport.com |access-date=April 7, 2016 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303205826/http://www.collegedegreereport.com/city-data/petroleum-engineers/denver-aurora |url-status=dead }}</ref> Advances in hydraulic fracturing have made the DJ Basin of Colorado into an accessible and lucrative oil play. Energy and mining are still important in Denver's economy today, with companies such as [[Ovintiv]], [[Halliburton]], [[Smith International]], [[Rio Tinto Group]], [[Newmont Mining]], and [[Chevron Corporation]], headquartered or having significant operations. Denver is in 149th place in terms of the cost of doing business in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/places/co/denver/|title=The Best Places For Business And Careers|website=[[Forbes]]}}</ref>

[[File:University of Denver campus pics 107.jpg|thumb|The first [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]], near the campus of the [[University of Denver]]]]
Denver's west-central geographic location in the [[Mountain Time Zone]] (UTC−7) also benefits the telecommunications industry by allowing communication with both North American coasts, South America, Europe, and Asia on the same business day. Denver's location on the 105th meridian at over {{convert|1|mi|km|spell=in}} in elevation also enables it to be the largest city in the U.S. to offer a "one-bounce" real-time satellite uplink to six continents in the same business day. [[Qwest Communications]] now part of [[CenturyLink]], [[Dish Network Corporation]], [[Starz (TV network)|Starz]], [[DIRECTV]], and [[Comcast]] are a few of the many telecommunications companies with operations in the Denver area. These and other high-tech companies had a boom in Denver in the mid to late 1990s. After a rise in unemployment in the [[Great Recession]], Denver's unemployment rate recovered and had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation at 2.6% in November 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.metrodenver.org/metro-denver-economy/monthly-summary |title=Monthly Economic Summary |author=Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation |publisher=Metro Denver Economic Development Corporation |date=January 2017 |access-date=February 4, 2017 |archive-date=February 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218105150/http://www.metrodenver.org/metro-denver-economy/monthly-summary |url-status=dead }}</ref> As of December 2016, the unemployment rate for the Denver–Aurora–Broomfield MSA is 2.6%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.co_denver_msa.htm |title=Denver-Aurora-Broomfield, CO Economy at a Glance |author=The Bureau of Labor Statistics |publisher=The Bureau of Labor Statistics|access-date=February 4, 2017}}</ref> The Downtown region has seen increased real estate investment<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.primedb.co/top-reasons-behind-denvers-booming-real-estate-market/|title=The Top Reasons behind Denver's Booming Real Estate Market – Home Renovations|access-date=May 7, 2017|archive-date=July 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730113931/http://www.primedb.co/top-reasons-behind-denvers-booming-real-estate-market/|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{update inline|date=June 2023}} with the construction of several new skyscrapers from 2010 onward and major development around [[Denver Union Station]].

Denver has also enjoyed success as a pioneer in the fast-casual restaurant industry, with many popular national chain restaurants founded and based in Denver. [[Quiznos]] and [[Smashburger]] were founded and headquartered in Denver. [[Qdoba Mexican Grill]], [[Noodles & Company]], and [[Good Times Burgers & Frozen Custard]] originated in Denver, but have moved their headquarters to the suburbs of [[Wheat Ridge, Colorado|Wheat Ridge]], [[Broomfield, Colorado|Broomfield]], and [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]], respectively. [[Chipotle Mexican Grill]] was founded in Denver, but moved its headquarters to [[Newport Beach, California]] in 2018.

In 2015, Denver ranked No. 1 on ''[[Forbes]]''{{'}} list of the Best Places for Business and Careers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Denver Leads Forbes' 2015 List Of The Best Places For Business And Careers|website=[[Forbes]]|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kurtbadenhausen/2015/07/29/denver-leads-the-2015-best-places-for-business-and-careers/|access-date=July 30, 2015}}</ref>

Including MLS soccer, it is also one of 10 U.S. cities to have five major sports teams.

The [[Denver Broncos]] of the [[National Football League]] have drawn crowds of over 70,000 since their origins in the early 1960s, and continue to draw fans today to their current home [[Empower Field at Mile High]]. The Broncos have sold out every home game (except for strike-replacement games) since 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/teams/denver-broncos/team-history/ |title=Team History |publisher=Pro Football Hall of Fame |access-date=December 31, 2015}}</ref> The Broncos have advanced to eight [[Super Bowl]]s and won back-to-back titles in 1997 and 1998, and won again in 2015.

The [[Colorado Rockies]] were created as an expansion franchise in 1993 and [[Coors Field]] opened in 1995. The Rockies advanced to the playoffs that year but were eliminated in the first round. In 2007, they advanced to the playoffs as a wild-card entrant, won the NL Championship Series, and brought the [[World Series]] to Denver for the first time but were swept in four games by the [[Boston Red Sox]].

Denver has been home to two National Hockey League teams. The [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]] played from 1976 to 1982, but later moved to the [[New York metropolitan area]] to become the [[New Jersey Devils]].

==Parks and recreation==
{{As of|2006}}, Denver had over 200 parks, from small [[pocket park]]s all over the city to the giant {{convert|314|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[City Park, Denver|City Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/parks/|title=Denver Parks & Recreation: Parks Division|publisher=City and County of Denver|access-date=August 18, 2006}}</ref> Denver also has 29 recreation centers providing places and programming for resident's recreation and relaxation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/TabId/37910/TopicId/1434/default.aspx |title=Recreation Centers and Programs |publisher=City and County of Denver |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070909091536/http://www.denvergov.org/TabId/37910/TopicId/1434/default.aspx |archive-date=September 9, 2007 |access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref>

Many of Denver's parks were acquired from state lands in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This coincided with the [[City Beautiful]] movement, and Denver mayor [[Robert W. Speer|Robert Speer]] (1904–12 and 1916–18) set out to expand and beautify the city's parks. Reinhard Schuetze was the city's first [[landscape architect]], and he brought his German-educated landscaping genius to [[Washington Park, Denver|Washington Park]], [[Cheesman Park, Denver|Cheesman Park]], and [[City Park, Denver|City Park]] among others. Speer used Schuetze as well as other landscape architects such as [[Frederick Law Olmsted Jr.]] and [[Saco Rienk DeBoer]] to design not only parks such as [[Civic Center, Denver|Civic Center Park]], but many city parkways and tree-lawns. Cheesman Park neighbor the [[Denver Botanic Gardens]] displays the beauty and versatility of micro-climates within the semi-arid [[Denver Basin]]. All of these parks were fed with [[South Platte River]] water diverted through the city ditch.<ref>Etter, Carolyn and Don. City of Parks: The Preservation of Denver's Park and Parkway System.

In addition to the parks within Denver, the city acquired land for [[Denver Mountain Parks|mountain parks]] starting in the 1911s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mountainparkshistory.org/Parks/index.html |title=Denver Mountain Parks History: Park Descriptions |publisher=Denver Mountain Parks Foundation |access-date=September 26, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013130345/http://mountainparkshistory.org/Parks/index.html |archive-date=October 13, 2007 }}</ref> Over the years, Denver has acquired, built and maintained approximately {{convert|14000|acre|km2}} of mountain parks, including [[Red Rocks Park]], which is known for its scenery and musical history revolving around the unique [[Red Rocks Amphitheatre]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denvergov.org/Mountain_Parks|title=Denver Mountain Parks |publisher=City and County of Denver |access-date=September 26, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061205045831/http://denvergov.org/Mountain_Parks/|archive-date=December 5, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denvergov.org/Mountain_Parks/MountainParks/MountainParks21/tabid/391213/Default.aspx |title=Denver Mountain Parks: Red Rocks Park |publisher=City and County of Denver |access-date=September 26, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061205045831/http://denvergov.org/Mountain_Parks/|archive-date=December 5, 2006 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Denver also owns the mountain on which the [[Winter Park Resort]] ski area operates in [[Grand County, Colorado|Grand County]], {{convert|67|mi|km|-1}} west of Denver.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1216/is_1_204/ai_58517783 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120604124552/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1216/is_1_204/ai_58517783/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 4, 2012 |title=Winter's tale&nbsp;– Winter Park Resort in Colorado |author=Lora J.

Denver continues to grow its park system with the development of many new parks along the Platte River through the city, and with Central Park and [[Bluff Lake Nature Center]] in the [[Central Park, Denver|Central Park]] neighborhood redevelopment. All of these parks are important gathering places for residents and allow what was once a dry plain to be lush, active, and green. Denver is also home to a large network of public [[community gardens]], most of which are managed by [[Denver Urban Gardens]], a non-profit organization.

Since 1974, Denver and the surrounding jurisdictions have rehabilitated the urban South Platte River and its tributaries for recreational use by hikers and cyclists. The main stem of the South Platte River Greenway runs along the South Platte {{convert|35|mi|km}} into Adams County in the north. The Greenway project is recognized as one of the best urban reclamation projects in the U.S., winning, for example, the Silver Medal [[Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence]] in 2001.<ref name="Bruner Foundation">{{cite web|title=Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence|url=http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba|publisher=Bruner Foundation|access-date=September 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130914092210/http://www.brunerfoundation.org/rba/|archive-date=September 14, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Denver is a [[consolidated city-county]] with a mayor elected on a [[Non-partisan democracy|nonpartisan]] ballot, a 13-member [[city council]], and an [[auditor]]. The [[Denver City Council]] is elected from 11 districts with two at-large council members and is responsible for passing and changing all laws, resolutions, and ordinances, usually after a public hearing. The city council can also call for misconduct investigations of Denver's departmental officials. All elected officials have four-year terms, with a maximum of three terms. The current mayor is [[Mike Johnston (Colorado politician)|Mike Johnston]].

Denver has a strong mayor/weak city council government. The mayor can approve or veto any ordinances or [[resolution (law)|resolution]]s approved by the council, makes sure all contracts with the city are kept and performed, signs all bonds and contracts, is responsible for the city budget, and can appoint people to various city departments, organizations, and commissions. The council can override the mayor's veto with a nine votes. The city budget must be approved and can be changed by a simple majority vote of the council. The auditor checks all expenditures and may refuse to allow specific ones, usually for financial reasons.<ref>{{cite web |title=How Our City Government Works |url=https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/city-of-denver-home/government/city-overview.html |date=2016 |publisher=City and County of Denver |access-date=February 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707133025/http://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/city-of-denver-home/government/city-overview.html |archive-date=July 7, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Denver Department of Safety oversees three branches: the [[Denver Police Department]], [[Denver Fire Department]], and [[Denver Sheriff Department]]. The Denver County Court is an integrated [[Colorado County Courts|Colorado County Court]] and Municipal Court and is managed by Denver instead of the state.

===Politics===
While Denver elections are nonpartisan, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] have long dominated the city's politics; most citywide officials are known to be registered with the Democratic Party. The mayor's office has been occupied by a Democrat since the 1963 municipal election. All the city's seats in the state legislature are held by Democrats.

In statewide elections, the city also tends to favor Democrats, though Republicans were occasionally competitive until the turn of the millennium.

In federal elections, Denver is a Democratic stronghold. It has supported a Democrat for president in every election since 1960, except 1972 and 1980. The city has swung heavily to the Democrats since the 1980s; [[Ronald Reagan]] is the last Republican to garner even 40 percent of the city's vote. At the federal level, Denver is the heart of {{ushr|CO|1}}, which includes all of Denver and parts of [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]]. It is the most Democratic district in the Mountain West and has been in Democratic hands for all but two terms since 1933. It is currently represented by Democrat [[Diana DeGette]].

[[Benjamin F. Stapleton]] was the mayor of Denver for two periods, from 1923 to 1931 and from 1935 to 1947. He was responsible for many civic improvements, notably during his second term, when he had access to funds and manpower from the [[New Deal]]. During this time, the park system was considerably expanded and the Civic Center completed. His signature project was the construction of Denver Municipal Airport, which began in 1929 amid heavy criticism. It was later renamed [[Stapleton International Airport]] in his honor. Today, the airport has been replaced by a neighborhood initially named Stapleton. In 2020, during the [[George Floyd protests]], because of Stapleton's demonstrated racism and prominent membership in the [[Ku Klux Klan]], neighborhood residents [[List of name changes due to the George Floyd protests|changed the name]] to Central Park.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Change the Name Information - Central Park United Neighbors |url=https://sites.google.com/site/sunwebsite1/Home/change-the-name-information |date=2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801202117/https://sites.google.com/site/sunwebsite1/Home/change-the-name-information |archive-date=August 1, 2020 |url-status=live |website=Central Park United Neighbors |access-date=December 26, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/08/01/stapleton-neighborhood-central-park/|title=Stapleton Neighborhood is Now Central Park After Final Vote|date=August 2020}}</ref>  Stapleton Street continues to bear his name.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Denver was one of the centers of the [[Chicano Movement]]. The boxer-turned-activist [[Rodolfo "Corky" Gonzales]] formed an organization called the Crusade for Justice, which battled police brutality, fought for bilingual education, and, most notably, hosted the First National [[Chicano Youth Liberation Conference]] in March 1969.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chicanomoratorium.org/html/history_timeline.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515043644/http://chicanomoratorium.org/html/history_timeline.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 15, 2011 |title=History Timeline |publisher=Chicanomoratorium.org |access-date=September 15, 2013 }}</ref>

In recent years, Denver has taken a stance on helping people who are or become [[Homelessness|homeless]], particularly under the administrations of mayors [[John Hickenlooper]] and [[Wellington Webb]]. At a rate of 19 homeless per 10,000 residents in 2011 as compared to 50 or more per 10,000 residents for the four metro areas with the highest rate of homelessness,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.endhomelessness.org/page/-/files/4361_file_Appendix_One.pdf |title=Homelessness in Large Metro Areas |publisher=Endhomelessness.org |access-date=December 31, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115013843/http://www.endhomelessness.org/page/-/files/4361_file_Appendix_One.pdf |archive-date=January 15, 2016 }}</ref> Denver's homeless population and rate of homeless are both considerably lower than many other major cities. But residents of the city streets suffer Denver winters – which, although mild and dry much of the time, can have brief periods of extremely cold temperatures and snow.

In 2005, Denver became the first major U.S. city to vote to make the private possession of less than an ounce of [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] legal for adults 21 and older.<ref name="DenverPot">{{Cite web |last=O'Driscoll |first=Patrick |date=2005-03-11 |title=Denver votes to legalize marijuana possession |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-11-03-pot_x.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120521002204/http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-11-03-pot_x.htm |archive-date=2012-05-21 |access-date=2024-10-09 |website= |publisher=[[USA Today]]}}</ref> The city voted 53.5 percent in favor of the [[marijuana legalization]] measure, which, as then-mayor John Hickenlooper pointed out, was without effect, because the city cannot usurp state law, which at that time treated marijuana possession in much the same way as a speeding ticket, with fines of up to $100 and no jail time.<ref name="DenverPot" /> Denver passed an initiative in the fourth quarter of 2007 requiring the mayor to appoint an 11-member review panel to monitor the city's compliance with the 2005 ordinance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2007/nov/12/denver-setting-panel-review-marijuana-cases/|title=Denver setting up panel to review marijuana cases|access-date=December 16, 2007|newspaper=Daily Camera|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215181015/http://www.dailycamera.com/news/2007/nov/12/denver-setting-panel-review-marijuana-cases/ |archive-date = December 15, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> In May 2019, Denver became the first U.S. city to [[Decriminalization|decriminalize]] [[psilocybin mushrooms]] after an initiative passed with 50.6% of the vote.

Denver hosted the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], which was the centennial of the city's first hosting of the landmark 1908 convention. It also hosted the [[G8|G7]] summit between June 20 and 22 in 1997 and the 2000 National Convention of the [[Green Party of the United States|Green Party]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/summit/2000/past_summit/table_e/index.html |title=List of Summit Meetings |publisher=MOFA |access-date=September 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Democratic National Convention |url=http://www.pepsicenter.com/Events/Event.aspx?eid=jBjB9FSNi20 |date=2008 |publisher=[[Pepsi Center]] |access-date=February 3, 2016}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In 1972, 1981, and 2008, Denver also hosted the [[Libertarian Party of the United States]] National Convention.

===Taxes===
The City and County of Denver levies an [[occupational privilege tax]] (OPT or head tax) on employers and employees.
*If any employee performs work in the city limits and is paid over $500 for that work in a single month, the employee and employer are both liable for the OPT regardless of where the main business office is located or headquartered.
*The employer is liable for $4 per employee per month and the employee is liable for $5.75 per month.
*It is the employer's responsibility to withhold, remit, and file the OPT returns. If an employer does not comply, the employer can be held liable for both portions of the OPT as well as penalties and interest.

Denver's many colleges and universities range in age and study programs. Three major public schools constitute the [[Auraria Campus]]: the [[University of Colorado Denver]], [[Metropolitan State University of Denver]], and [[Community College of Denver]]. The private [[University of Denver]] was the first institution of higher learning in the city and was founded in 1864. Other prominent Denver higher education institutions include [[Johnson & Wales University]], Catholic ([[Jesuit]]) [[Regis University]], and the city has Roman Catholic and Jewish institutions, as well as a health sciences school. In addition to those schools within the city, there are a number of schools throughout the surrounding metro area.

Denver–Boulder radio is the No. 19 market in the United States, according to the Spring 2011 [[Nielsen Audio|Arbitron]] ranking (up from No. 20 in Fall 2009). For a list of Denver radio stations, see [[List of radio stations in Colorado]].

===Print===
After continued rivalry between Denver's two main newspapers, ''[[The Denver Post]]'' and the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'', the papers merged operations in 2001 under a [[joint operating agreement]] that formed the [[Denver Newspaper Agency]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denvernewspaperagency.com |title=Denver Newspaper Agency |access-date=December 15, 2006 |archive-date=December 15, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061215111435/http://www.denvernewspaperagency.com/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> This arrangement lasted until February 2009 when the E. W. Scripps Company, the owner of the ''Rocky Mountain News'', closed the paper. There are also several alternative or localized newspapers published in Denver, including the ''[[Westword]]'', ''[[Law Week Colorado]]'', ''[[Out Front Colorado]],'' and the ''[[Intermountain Jewish News]]''. Denver is home to multiple regional magazines such as ''[[5280]]'', which takes its name from the city's mile-high elevation ({{convert|5280|ft|m|0|disp=or|sp=us}}).

==Transportation==
[[File:Sunrise Over Denver Skyline.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2|Dawn over downtown Denver, viewed from the north with Pikes Peak and the southern [[Front Range]] to the south]]

===City streets===
{{Main|Street system of Denver}}
[[File:Colfaxatbroadway.JPG|thumb|upright|Colfax Avenue at Broadway, where the downtown street grid and the "normal" city grid meet. Colfax Avenue carries [[U.S. Route 40 in Colorado|U.S. Highway 40]] through Denver.]]

Most of Denver has a straightforward [[street grid]] oriented to the four [[cardinal direction]]s. Blocks are usually identified in hundreds from the median streets, identified as "00", which are Broadway (the east–west median, running north–south) and Ellsworth Avenue (the north–south median, running east–west). [[Colfax Avenue]], a major east–west artery through Denver, is 15 blocks (1500) north of the median. Avenues north of Ellsworth are numbered (with the exception of Colfax Avenue and several others, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. Blvd and Montview Blvd.), while avenues south of Ellsworth are named.

There is also an older downtown grid system that was designed to be parallel to the confluence of the [[South Platte River]] and [[Cherry Creek (Colorado)|Cherry Creek]]. Most of the streets downtown and in [[LoDo]] run northeast–southwest and northwest–southeast. This system has an unplanned benefit for snow removal; if the streets were in a normal N–S/E–W grid, only the N–S streets would receive sunlight. With the grid oriented to the diagonal directions, the NW–SE streets receive sunlight to melt snow in the morning and the NE–SW streets receive it in the afternoon. This idea was from Henry Brown the founder of the [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]]. There is now a plaque across the street from the [[Brown Palace Hotel (Denver, Colorado)|Brown Palace Hotel]] that honors this idea. The NW–SE streets are numbered, while the NE–SW streets are named. The named streets start at the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway with the block-long Cheyenne Place. The numbered streets start underneath the Colfax and I-25 viaducts. There are 27 named and 44 numbered streets on this grid. There are also a few vestiges of the old grid system in the normal grid, such as Park Avenue, Morrison Road, and Speer Boulevard. Larimer Street, named after [[William Larimer Jr.]], the founder of Denver, which is in the heart of [[LoDo]], is the oldest street in Denver.
[[File:Denver skyline from Speer Blvd near I-25, April 2019.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright=1.35|Speer Boulevard runs north–south through downtown Denver.]]
All roads in the downtown grid system are streets (e.g., [[16th Street Mall|16th Street]], Stout Street), except for the five NE–SW roads nearest the intersection of Colfax Avenue and Broadway: Cheyenne Place, Cleveland Place, Court Place, Tremont Place and Glenarm Place. Roads outside that system that travel east–west are designated "avenues" and those that travel north–south are designated "streets" (e.g., Colfax Avenue, Lincoln Street). Boulevards are higher capacity streets and travel any direction (more commonly north and south). Smaller roads are sometimes referred to as places, drives (though not all drives are smaller capacity roads; some are major thoroughfares), or courts. Most streets outside the area between Broadway and Colorado Boulevard are organized alphabetically from the city's center.

East of Colorado Boulevard, the naming convention of streets takes on a predictable pattern of going through the alphabet by using each letter twice (i.e. AA, BB, CC, DD, through YY – there is no Z). The first street is almost always named after a plant or fruit, the second street is almost always named after a foreign place or location. For example, Jersey Street / Jasmine Street, Quebec Street / Quince Street, and Syracuse Street / Spruce Street. Inexplicably, the letter Y only has one street (Yosemite), and there is no Z.

Some Denver streets have [[bicycle lanes]], leaving a patchwork of disjointed routes throughout the city.

===Cycling===
The [[League of American Bicyclists]] rated Colorado as the sixth most bicycle-friendly state in the nation for 2014. This is due in large part to Front Range cities like Boulder, Fort Collins and Denver placing an emphasis on legislation, programs and infrastructure developments that promote cycling as a mode of transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/2014_state_ranking_chart.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809100842/http://bikeleague.org/sites/default/files/2014_state_ranking_chart.pdf |archive-date=2014-08-09 |url-status=live |title=Bicycle Friendly State : 2014 Ranking |publisher=Bike League |access-date=April 7, 2016}}</ref> [[Walk Score]] has rated Denver as the fourth most bicycle-friendly large city in the United States.<ref name="walkscore" /> According to data from the 2011 American Community Survey, Denver ranks 6th among US cities with populations over 400,000 in terms of the percentage of [[List of U.S. cities with most bicycle commuters|workers who commute by bicycle]] at 2.2% of commuters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://denverurbanism.com/2011/10/denver-hits-2-2-bicycle-commuter-mode-share-for-2010.html |title=Denver Hits 2.2% Bicycle Commuter Mode Share for 2010 " DenverUrbanism Blog |publisher=Denverurbanism.com |date=October 17, 2011 |access-date=September 15, 2013}}</ref>

=== Electric rental scooters ===
In 2018, [[Motorized scooter|electric scooter]] services began to place scooters in Denver. Hundreds of unsanctioned LimeBike and Bird electric scooters appeared on Denver streets in May, causing an uproar. In June, the city ordered the companies to remove them<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2018/06/13/denver-electric-scooter-rentals/|title=Denver officials seize more than 250 electric scooters from city streets, levy fines|date=June 14, 2018|work=The Denver Post|access-date=September 14, 2018}}</ref> and acted quickly to create an official program, including a requirement that scooters be left at RTD stops and out of the public right-of-way. Lime and Bird scooters then reappeared in late July, with limited compliance.

===Modal characteristics===
In 2015, 9.6 percent of Denver households lacked a car, and in 2016, this was virtually unchanged (9.4 percent). The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Denver averaged 1.62 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Car Ownership in U.S. Cities Data and Map|journal=Governing|date=December 9, 2014|url=http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|access-date=May 4, 2018|archive-date=May 11, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180511162014/http://www.governing.com/gov-data/car-ownership-numbers-of-vehicles-by-city-map.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Freeways and highways===
Denver is primarily served by the interstate freeways [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|I-25]] and [[Interstate 70 (Colorado)|I-70]]. The problematic intersection of the two interstates is referred to locally as "[[Mousetrap (Denver)|the mousetrap]]" because, when viewed from the air, the junction (and subsequent vehicles) resemble mice in a large trap.
* [[File:I-25 (CO).svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]]''' runs north–south from [[New Mexico]] through Denver to [[Wyoming]]
* [[File:I-225 (CO).svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[Interstate 225 (Colorado)|Interstate 225]]''' traverses neighboring Aurora. I-225 was designed to link Aurora with I-25 in the southeastern corner of Denver, and I-70 to the north of Aurora, with construction starting May 1964 and ending May 21, 1976.
* [[File:I-70 (CO).svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[Interstate 70 (Colorado)|Interstate 70]]''' runs east–west from [[Utah]] to [[Maryland]]. It is also the primary corridor on which motorists access the mountains.
* [[File:I-270 (CO).svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[Interstate 270 (Colorado)|Interstate 270]]''' runs concurrently with [[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]] from an interchange with [[Interstate 70 (Colorado)|Interstate 70]] in northeast Denver to an interchange with [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]] north of Denver. The freeway continues as [[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]] from the interchange with [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]].
* [[File:I-76 (CO).svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[Interstate 76 (Colorado)|Interstate 76]]''' begins from I-70 just west of the city in [[Arvada, Colorado|Arvada]]. It intersects I-25 north of the city and runs northeast to Nebraska where it ends at [[Interstate 80 (Nebraska)|I-80]].
* [[File:US 6.svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[U.S. Highway 6 (Colorado)|US 6]]''' follows the alignment of 6th Avenue west of I-25, and connects downtown Denver to the west-central suburbs of [[Golden, Colorado|Golden]] and [[Lakewood, Colorado|Lakewood]]. It continues west through Utah and [[Nevada]] to [[Bishop, California]]. To the east, it continues as far as [[Provincetown, Massachusetts|Provincetown]], on [[Cape Cod]] in [[Massachusetts]].
*[[File:US 285.svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[U.S. Highway 285 (Colorado)|US 285]]''' ends its {{convert|847|mi|km|adj=on}} route through [[New Mexico]] and [[Texas]] at [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]] in the University Hills neighborhood.
* [[File:US 85.svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[U.S. Highway 85 (Colorado)|US 85]]''' also travels through Denver. This highway is often used as an alternate route to [[Castle Rock, Colorado|Castle Rock]] instead of taking [[Interstate 225 (Colorado)|Interstate 25]].
* [[File:US 87.svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[U.S. Route 87]]''' runs north–south and through Denver. It is concurrent with I-25 the entire length in the state.
* [[File:US 36.svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]]''' connects Denver to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Rocky Mountain National Park]] near [[Estes Park, Colorado|Estes Park]]. It runs east into [[Ohio]], after crossing four other states.
* [[File:Colorado 93.svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[Colorado State Highway 93|State Highway 93]]''' starts in the western Metropolitan area in [[Golden, Colorado]], and travels almost {{convert|19|mi|km}} to meet with [[Colorado State Highway 119|SH&nbsp;119]] in central [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]]. This highway is often used as an alternate route to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] instead of taking [[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]].
* [[File:Colorado 470.svg|25px|link=|alt=]] '''[[Colorado State Highway 470|State Highway 470]]''' ('''C-470''', '''SH 470''') is the southwestern portion of the Denver metro area's beltway. Originally planned as Interstate 470 in the 1960s, the beltway project was attacked on environmental impact grounds and the interstate beltway was never built. The portion of "Interstate 470" built as a [[state highway]] is the present-day SH 470, which is a [[freeway]] for its entire length.

Denver also has a nearly complete beltway known as "the 470's". These are [[SH 470 (CO)|SH 470]] (also known as C-470), a freeway in the southwest Metro area, and two toll highways, [[E-470]] (from southeast to northeast) and [[Northwest Parkway]] (from terminus of E-470 to [[U.S. Highway 36 (Colorado)|US 36]]). SH 470 was intended to be I-470 and built with federal highway funds, but the funding was redirected to complete conversion of downtown Denver's [[16th Street Mall|16th Street]] to a pedestrian mall. As a result, construction was delayed until 1980 after state and local legislation was passed.<ref>{{cite web |author=Matthew E. Salek |url=http://www.mesalek.com/colo/denvers470.html |title=C-470?

Lamm's declared intention to drive a silver stake through it and kill it.

A highway expansion and transit project for the southern [[Interstate 25 (Colorado)|I-25]] corridor, dubbed T-REX ([[Transportation Expansion Project]]), was completed on November 17, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |title=T-REX Announces Opening Day for Southeast Light Rail Line |url=http://www.denvergov.org/Southeast_Corridor/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures2005/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures20055/tabid/393990/Default.aspx |date=2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013125106/http://denvergov.org/Southeast_Corridor/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures2005/GeneralInformation/RoadClosures20055/tabid/393990/Default.aspx |archive-date=October 13, 2007 |publisher=City and County of Denver |access-date=February 3, 2016}}</ref> The project installed wider and additional highway lanes, and improved highway access and drainage.

[[Public transport|Mass transportation]] throughout the [[Denver metropolitan area]] is managed and coordinated by the [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD). RTD operates more than 1,000 [[bus]]es serving over 10,000 bus stops in 38 municipal jurisdictions in eight counties around the [[Denver-Aurora-Boulder Combined Statistical Area|Denver and Boulder metropolitan areas]]. Additionally, RTD operates ten [[RTD Bus & Rail|rail]] lines, the A, B, D, E, G, H, L, N, R, and W, with a total of {{convert|113|mi|km}} of track, serving 77 stations, 35 of which are located within the City of Denver proper. The [[D Line (RTD)|D]], [[E Line (RTD)|E]], [[H Line (RTD)|H]], [[L Line (RTD)|L]], [[R Line (RTD)|R]], and [[W Line (RTD)|W Lines]] are [[light rail]] while the [[A Line (RTD)|A]], [[B Line (RTD)|B]], [[G (RTD)|G]], and [[N Line (RTD)|N Lines]] are [[commuter rail]].

[[FasTracks]] is a commuter rail, light rail, and bus expansion project approved by voters in 2004, which will serve neighboring suburbs and communities. The [[W Line (RTD)|W Line]], or West line, opened in April 2013 serving Golden/Federal Center.

An express bus service, known as the [[Flatiron Flyer]], serves to connect Boulder and Denver. The service, billed as [[bus rapid transit]], has been accused of [[bus rapid transit creep]] for failing to meet the majority of BRT requirements, including level boarding and all-door entry. A commuter rail connection to Boulder and its suburb of Longmont, also part of the FasTracks ballot initiative and an extension of the [[B Line (RTD)|B Line]], is planned to be finished by RTD, but no construction funds have yet been identified prior to 2040.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dailycamera.com/boulder-county-news/ci_32583756/rtd-recommits-completing-train-service-boulder-longmont-considering |title=RTD recommits to completing train service to Boulder, Longmont, considering interim plan |newspaper=Daily Camera |access-date=April 20, 2019}}</ref> RTD is currently considering an interim commuter service which would run rush-hour trains from Longmont to Denver.

[[Greyhound Lines]], the [[intercity bus]] operator, has a major hub in Denver, with routes to New York City, [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Las Vegas]], and their headquarters, [[Dallas]]. Subsidiary [[Autobuses Americanos]] provides service to [[El Paso]]. Allied bus operators [[Express Arrow]], and [[Burlington Trailways]] provide service to [[Billings, Montana|Billings]], [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Indianapolis]], and [[Alamosa, Colorado|Alamosa]].

[[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to Denver, operating its ''[[California Zephyr]]'' daily in both directions between [[Union Station (Chicago)|Chicago]] and [[Emeryville, California]], across the bay from San Francisco. Amtrak Thruway service operated by private bus companies links the Denver station with Rocky Mountain points. In 2017 the Colorado legislature reinvigorated studies of passenger rail service along the Front Range, potentially connecting Denver to Fort Collins and [[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]], or further to Amtrak connections in [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]] and [[Trinidad, Colorado|Trinidad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.coloradoan.com/story/news/2019/06/13/colorado-serious-look-passenger-rail-service-front-range/1442541001/ |title=Backers believe this Front Range passenger rail plan is the real deal

At [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], Denver Thruway connections are made daily with the Amtrak ''[[Southwest Chief]]''. Additionally, the [[Ski Train]] operated on the former [[Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad]], which took passengers between Denver and the [[Winter Park, Colorado|Winter Park]] Ski Resort, but it is no longer in service. The Ski Train made its final run to Winter Park on March 29, 2009. The service was revived on a trial basis in 2016 with a great amount of local fanfare. Further development of a mountain corridor rail option, though publicly popular, has been met with resistance from politicians, namely the director of [[Colorado Department of Transportation]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.5280.com/news/magazine/2017/02/can-i-70s-mountain-corridor-ever-be-fixed|title=Can I-70's Mountain Corridor Ever Be Fixed?|date=February 15, 2017|work=5280|access-date=March 6, 2017|language=en}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=July 2017}} The Ski Train did return to service under [[Amtrak]] with the name "[[Ski Train|Winter Park Express]]" in 2017, and currently runs only on Saturdays, Sundays, and major holidays during the winter ski seasons.

Denver's early years as a major train hub of the west are still very visible today. Trains stop in Denver at historic [[Union Station (Denver)|Union Station]], where travelers can access RTD's 16th Street Free MallRide or use light rail to tour the city. [[Union Station (Denver)|Union Station]] will also serve as the main juncture for rail travel in the metro area, at the completion of [[FasTracks]].

[[Denver International Airport]] (IATA: DEN, ICAO: KDEN), commonly known as DIA, serves as the primary airport for the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] surrounding Denver. DIA is {{convert|18.6|mi|km|0|sp=us}} east-northeast of the [[Colorado State Capitol]] and opened in 1995. DIA is the 3rd busiest airport in the world with 58.8 million passengers in 2021;<ref>{{cite web |title=The top 10 busiest airports in the world revealed |url=https://aci.aero/2022/04/11/the-top-10-busiest-airports-in-the-world-revealed/ |website=Airports Council International |access-date=6 September 2022 |date=April 11, 2022}}</ref> it had the 5th highest number of passengers in the U.S., 61 million, in the pre-pandemic year 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=The 10 Busiest Airports In The United States |url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/busiest-airports-in-united-states.html#h_76256299224191615961355476 |website=WorldAtlas |date=March 17, 2021 |access-date=6 September 2022}}</ref> It covers more than {{convert|52.4|sqmi|1}}, making it the largest airport by land area in the United States and larger than the island of [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Denver Airport |url=https://www.travelandleisure.com/airlines-airports/denver-airport |website=Travel + Leisure |access-date=6 September 2022}}</ref> DIA serves as a major hub for [[United Airlines]], is the headquarters and primary hub for [[Frontier Airlines]], and is a major focus city and the fastest-growing market for [[Southwest Airlines]].

In 2017, [[Denver International Airport]] was rated by [[Skytrax]] as the 28th-best airport in the world, falling to second place in the United States behind [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]]. Skytrax also named DIA as the second-best regional airport in North America for 2017, and the fourth-best regional airport in the world.

Three [[general aviation]] airports serve the Denver area. [[Rocky Mountain Metropolitan Airport]] (KBJC) is {{convert|13.7|mi|km|0|sp=us}} north-northwest, [[Centennial Airport]] (KAPA) is {{convert|13.7|mi|km|0|sp=us}} south-southeast, and [[Colorado Air and Space Port]] (KCFO), formerly Front Range Airport, is {{convert|23.7|mi|km|0|sp=us}} east of the state capitol. Centennial Airport also offers limited commercial airline service, on two cargo airlines.

In the past, Denver has been home to several other airports that are no longer operational. [[Stapleton International Airport]] was closed in 1995 when it was replaced by DIA. [[Lowry Air Force Base]] was a military flight training facility that ceased flight operations in 1966, with the base finally closing in 1994. Both Stapleton and Lowry have since been redeveloped into primarily residential neighborhoods. [[Buckley Space Force Base]] is the only military facility in the Denver area.

==Twin towns – sister cities==
Denver's relationship with [[Brest, France]], began in 1948, making it the second-oldest [[sister city]] in the United States.<ref>{{cite web

When she returned, she shared her experiences in the city with her students, and her class raised $32,000 to help rebuild the children's wing of Brest's hospital. The gift led to the development of the sister city program with Brest.<ref>[http://denversistercities.org/brest/ Sister City History]. Denver Sister Cities International. Retrieved on November 11, 2006.</ref> There were serious efforts in the early 2000s, in both Denver and [[Sochi]], [[Russian Federation]], to establish sister-city ties, but the negotiations did not come to fruition.

Since then, Denver has established relationships with additional sister cities:<ref>{{cite web |title=Denver Sister Cities International|url=https://www.denvergov.org/content/denvergov/en/human-rights-and-community-partnerships/programs---initiatives/denver-sister-cities.html|publisher=City and County of Denver|access-date=June 30, 2020}}</ref>
