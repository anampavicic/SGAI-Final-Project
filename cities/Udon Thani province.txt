'''Udon Thani province''' ([[Thai language|Thai]]/{{langx|tts|อุดรธานี}}, {{IPA|th|ʔù.dɔ̄ːn tʰāː.nīː}}, {{IPA-lo|ʔú.dɔ̀ːn tʰáː.níː}}) is one of Thailand's seventy-six provinces (''changwat'') which lies in [[Isan#Administrative divisions|upper northeastern Thailand]], also called [[Isan]]. It is bordered by the provinces of [[Nong Khai province|Nong Khai]] to the north, [[Sakon Nakhon province|Sakon Nakhon]] to the east, [[Kalasin province]] to the southeast, [[Khon Kaen province|Khon Kaen]] to the south, and [[Loei province|Loei]] and [[Nong Bua Lamphu province|Nong Bua Lamphu]] to the west. It occupies an area of {{convert|11,072|km²|abbr=on}}. The total forest area is {{convert|1,131|km²|abbr=on}} or 10.2 percent of provincial area.<ref name="RFD"/> The provincial capital is [[Udon Thani]], the major city in the province.

==Toponymy==
Udon Thani is said to mean 'northern city'. ''Udon'' is derived from ''utara'' in [[Sanskrit]], meaning 'northern direction', as Udon Thani is northeast of [[Bangkok]]. ''Thani'' means 'city'.

==History==
Udon Thani first came to historical notice in the [[Rattanakosin era]], when [[Anuwong]] of [[Vientiane]] staged a rebellion against Thai rule and marched his army to Nakhon Ratchasima in 1826. He captured the city by a ruse, but the garrison he left to hold it unexpectedly met with fierce resistance from the disarmed local forces led by [[Thao Suranaree|Lady Mo]], the wife of Nakhon Ratchasima's governor. Anuwong advanced as far as [[Saraburi]], but was forced to retreat. The Thai army pursued him, and the rival forces met in battle at [[Nong Bua Lamphu]], a small city near today's Udon Thani. After two days of fierce fighting, Anuwong's army was defeated and fled back to [[Laos]].<ref>Udon Thani Provincial Office (1985), ''Udon Thani: A History of a Provincial Administration'', Bangkok: Amarin Printing.</ref>

Once known as Ban Mak-kaeng, Udon Thani was originally settled as a military base established by Prince Prachaksinlapakhom to suppress an uprising in the northeastern city of [[Lao Phuan|Lao Puan]]. Ban Mak-kaeng grew slowly from a small rural town to become what is now the city of Udon Thani. He founded Udon Thani town in 1893, established the civil administration and served important official duties for the region.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.tourismthailand.org/Attraction/the-monument-of-krommaluang-prachaksinlapakhom | title= The Monument Of Krommaluang Prachaksinlapakhom | author=<!--Not stated--> |publisher=[[Tourism Authority of Thailand]] |access-date=11 May 2021}}</ref>

The province is best known for the prehistoric archaeological site at [[Ban Chiang]] and its [[Bronze Age]] relics, in a hamlet about {{convert|50|km|mi|sp=us}} east of Udon Thani. Udon Thani is one of the more bustling markets for agricultural goods in the relatively dry northeast of Thailand.

Udon Thani received its biggest economic boost in the 1960s when the United States built the [[Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base]] as a joint-force military base during the [[Vietnam War]]. The Mel Gibson film ''[[Air America (movie)|Air America]]'' depicts Udon and includes scenes of Udon's air base. Udon Thani was also the largest base in the region for the CIA's [[anti-communism]] campaign in Thailand and Laos.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2013-06-16 |title=Thailand's boom: To the northeast, the spoils |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thailand-northeast-idUSBRE95F00H20130616 |access-date=2022-05-02}}</ref> The United States turned the base over to the Royal Thai Air Force in 1976, but its presence left three residual effects on Udon. First, a large number of locals had been paid comparatively well and had learned basic conversational English. This made them more marketable to the outside world, and a significant number went to work in Middle East oilfields. Second, the base created long-standing ties with the [[United States]], including a US consulate in Udon (closed in 1995), and a US [[Veterans of Foreign Wars]] post. But most importantly, the base and the consulate made the city into a regional hub for the northeast, and this continues today.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

In recent years Udon received international attention because of the discovery of large [[potash]] deposits.<ref>{{cite web |title=ASIA PACIFIC POTASH CORPORATION LIMITED OVERVIEW OF UDON THANI POTASH PROJECT |url=http://www.appc.co.th/en/company_overview.html |website=Asia Pacific Potash Corporation |access-date=12 June 2018}}</ref> Some anticipate the region would become a major exporter of the mineral. However, granting the necessary approvals has been substantially delayed due to public opposition to mining. Many villagers living near the proposed mine site fear that the mining company's [[environmental impact assessment]] (EIA) did not adequately address the problems of salinization of the groundwater and soil, as well as probability of land subsidence. Either of these would seriously threaten the economic stability of local communities that depend on rice farming for income. An existing potash mine, [[Udon North mine]] has attracted local opposition.

== Population and demographics ==
Udon Thani's geographic position in the north of [[northeastern Thailand]] and its proximity to the [[Laos|Laotian]] capital, [[Vientiane]], has contributed to the province's rapid development as a transport and industrial hub. This has created jobs and attracted migrants from other states as well as from overseas, particularly from [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]], [[Myanmar]], [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Pakistan]], and [[China]]. In recent decades, the influx of [[illegal immigrant]]s, particularly from Vietnam, has further swelled Udon Thani's population. Udon Thani had a population of 1,562,520 as of 2023.  The province's [[ethnicity|ethnic composition]] consists of Lao, Chinese, and other ethnic groups. Population in eact Districts as follow:
