'''Kanggye''' ({{Korean|hangul=강계시}}; {{IPA|ko|kɐŋ.ɡje}}) is the provincial capital of [[Chagang]], [[North Korea]] and has a population of 251,971. Because of its strategic importance, derived from its [[topography]], it has been of military interest from the time of the [[Joseon Dynasty]] (1392-1910).

==History==
In December 1949, Kanggye-myon was promoted to Kanggye-si.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0101&direct=1&ac=A0401|access-date=2021-09-17|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

During the [[Korean War]], after being driven from [[Pyongyang]], [[Kim Il Sung]] and his government temporarily moved the capital to Kanggye after first moving temporarily to [[Sinuiju]].<ref name="mossman" /><ref name="sandler" /> The city was firebombed in November 1950 on American general [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s orders after the Chinese [[People's Volunteer Army]] turned the course of the war; at least 65% of the city was destroyed.<ref>Barros, Andrew and Martin Thomas (2018) ''The Civilianization of War''</ref> The following month Kim presided over a plenum of the [[Cabinet of North Korea|cabinet]] at Kanggye, where he assigned blame for what he claimed were military failures during the losing phase of the war.<ref>Song, Wojun and Joseph Wright (2018) "The North Korean Autocracy in Comparative Perspective" ''Journal of East Asian Studies'' 20:2</ref>
==Culture==

Kanggye is home to an open-air stadium and is also home to the Kanggye Riding Club, which was built in 2024. Kanggye has scenic walkways along the Changja River and a small waterpark.

Other places of interest include [[Inphung Pavilion]] and [[Mount Ryonhwa]]. Tourist attractions have been developed to show the mountainous nature of the city.

=== Facilities ===
[[Kanggye University of Education]], [[Kanggye University of Technology]], and the [[Kanggye University of Medicine]] are located in the city.

The city has more than 50 various medical centres including an oral care and a maternity hospital.<ref>{{Cite web |title=북한지역정보넷 |url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0105&direct=1&ac=A0401 |access-date=2021-09-17 |website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

==Transportation==
Kanggye is a transportation hub, connected to other cities by road, rail and air. It lies at the junction of the [[Kanggye Line|Kanggye]] and [[Manp'o Line]]s. Commuter trains run on the Manpo line between Kanggye and Ssangbangdong stations. In addition, highways connect it to [[Pyongyang]] and other locations, with the road network of Chagang province being centered on the city. The city is located near a military and civilian dual-purpose air station.<ref>{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0104&direct=1&ac=A0401|access-date=2021-09-17|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

Kanggye has a [[trolleybus]] (무궤도전차) system, opened on April 17, 1992, with one 12&nbsp;km line running from Changja-dong to Kong'in-dong, following the embankment of the Changja and Puchon rivers. Up until 2009 it had 6 full length and 2 medium trolleybuses; in the 2010s 5 full length and 1 medium trolleybus remained. In 2020, the northern loop was built into a small depot.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kanggye|url=https://transphoto.org/city/1294/|access-date=2020-10-16|website=transphoto.org}}</ref>

==Broadcasting==
A local radio station called "Kanggye Broadcasting ({{Korean|hangul=강계방송|labels=no}})", originally founded in 1947 as a local broadcasting station for [[North Pyongan Province]], which later became a local broadcasting station for [[Chagang Province]] in 1949. It is operated by the Chagang Province Broadcasting Committee ({{Korean|hangul=자강도 방송위원회|labels=no}}). It airs programs that cover topics such as ideological education or local weather information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Item/E0070614|title=강계방송|publisher=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|access-date=2021-02-02}}</ref>

==Economy==
From 1945, the manufacturing industry developed rapidly.

Kanggye has a [[mining]] industry producing [[copper]], [[zinc]] ore, [[coal]] and [[graphite]].

Kanggye hosts one of the main [[Kanggye Timber Processing Factory|timber processing factories]] of [[Chagang]] province and [[North Korea]]. The city has various light industry along with production of construction, electrical and precision machinery. The pencils produced, which are also exported, have 'national significance'. The city also has agricultural, fruit, vegetable and livestock production.<ref>{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0103&direct=1&ac=A0401|access-date=2021-09-17|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

The city has a large number of hydropower plants due to its location near a number of rivers. The first hydropower station in a series of them is called Hungju No.1 Youth Power Station, is located 3.5&nbsp;km north of Kanggye. It is supported by the Ryongrim dam, which does not have a power station attached to it.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=2019-08-29|title=North Korea’s Hydroelectric Power – Part II {{!}} 38 North: Informed Analysis of North Korea|url=https://www.38north.org/2019/08/hydropower082919/|access-date=2021-09-17|website=[[38 North]]|language=en}}</ref> This allows a careful management of the water level to ensure efficient operation.<ref>{{Cite web|title=《조선의 오늘》|url=https://dprktoday.com/abroad/news/8255?lang=|access-date=2021-09-17|website=[[DPRK Today]]}}</ref> This is followed by the Hungju Youth Power Station No. 2 and 3.

===Kanggye Timber Processing Factory===
[[Image:Fabrica Procesamiento Madera Kanggye (3).jpg|thumb|250px]]
 
Kanggye Timber Processing Factory(강계목재가공공장) is a small state-run factory located in Kanggye City. At the start of operations, it produced only two kinds of furniture (dining tables and sterilized chopsticks) through manual labour. Over time it has developed into a comprehensive modernized furniture producer, producing woodwork with a hundred and dozens of modern facilities in production.
 
Amongst machinery in use are three- and four-faced automatic planes, all-purpose polishers, joining machines, and grooving saws.
 
Meanwhile, the factory has directed an effort into the programme of modernizing the drying job, which is an important part of the woodworking process. By making technical innovations (such as replacing a boiler-induced drying process drying ovens and using fuels other than coal) the factory increased production and lowered manpower.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://m.unityinfo.co.kr/4417|title=[탐방] 목재가구공장|website=통일신문}}{{Dead link|date=October 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
