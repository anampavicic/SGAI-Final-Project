}} is the largest city in northeastern [[Poland]] and the capital of the [[Podlaskie Voivodeship]]. It is the [[List of cities and towns in Poland|tenth-largest city]] in Poland, second in terms of population density, and thirteenth in area.

Białystok is located in the Białystok Uplands of the [[Podlachia|Podlachian Plain]] on the banks of the [[Biała (Supraśl)|Biała River]], 200&nbsp;km (124&nbsp;mi) northeast of [[Warsaw]].<ref name="GM">{{Google maps | url =https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Warsaw,+Poland/53.135278,23.145556/@52.6906208,21.4918801,166046m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m8!4m7!1m5!1m1!1s0x471ecc669a869f01:0x72f0be2a88ead3fc!2m2!1d21.0122287!2d52.2296756!1m0?hl=en | accessdate =14 October 2022}}</ref> It has historically attracted migrants from elsewhere in Poland and beyond, particularly from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. This is facilitated by the [[Belarus–Poland border|nearby border]] with [[Belarus]] also being the eastern border of the [[European Union]], as well as the [[Schengen Area]]. The city and its adjacent municipalities constitute [[Metropolitan Białystok]]. The city has a [[Humid continental climate#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Mild to warm summer subtype|warm summer continental climate]], characterized by warm summers and long frosty winters. Forests are an important part of Białystok's character and occupy around {{convert|1846|ha|abbr=on}} (18% of the administrative area of the city)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bialystok.pl/pl/dla_mieszkancow/ochrona_srodowiska/przyroda_w_naszym_miescie/|title=Lasy|access-date=2021-01-21|archive-date=2021-01-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121115508/https://www.bialystok.pl/pl/dla_mieszkancow/ochrona_srodowiska/przyroda_w_naszym_miescie/|url-status=live}}</ref> which places it as the fifth-most forested city in Poland.

The first settlers arrived in the 14th century. The town grew and received its municipal charter in 1692. Białystok has traditionally been one of the leading centers of academic, cultural, and artistic life in [[Podlachia]], and the most important economic center in northeastern Poland. Białystok was once an important center for [[light industry]], which was the reason for the substantial growth of the city's population. The city continues to reshape itself into a modern middle-sized city. Białystok, in 2010, was on the short-list, but ultimately lost the competition, to become a finalist for [[European Capital of Culture]] in 2016.

==Etymology==
Although nowadays "stok" is translated as "slope", the initial name of the settlement came from the river flowing through it. In old Polish, ''biały stok'' was white river (''biały'' - white, ''stok'' - stream; river that "slides" down the slope). So inconspicuous today, the Biała River (usually called Białka), flowing through the city center, gave it its name.

Due to changing borders and demographics over the centuries, the city has been known as {{langx|be|Беласток}} (''Byelastok''<sup>[[BGN/PCGN romanization of Belarusian|?]]</sup>, ''Biełastok''<sup>[[Łacinka|?]]</sup> {{IPA|be|bʲeɫaˈstok|}}), {{langx|yi|ביאַליסטאָק}} (''Byalistok'', ''Bjalistok''), {{langx|lt|Balstogė}}, and {{langx|ru|Белосток}} (''Belostok'', ''Byelostok'').

The city of Białystok has existed for five centuries and during this time the fate of the city has been affected by various political and economic forces.

Surviving documents attest that around 1437 a representative of the Raczków family, Jakub Tabutowicz of the coat of arms [[Łabędź coat of arms|Łabędź]], received from [[Michael Žygimantaitis]], son of the Grand Duke of Lithuania [[Sigismund Kęstutaitis]], a wilderness area along the river Biała that marked the beginning of Białystok as a settlement.<ref name=bialystok.polska.pl>{{cite web |url=http://bialystok.polska.pl/miastodawniej/article,Do_rozbiorow,id,323459.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319205652/http://bialystok.polska.pl/miastodawniej/article%2CDo_rozbiorow%2Cid%2C323459.htm |archive-date=2012-03-19 |title=Miasta w Dokumencie Archiwalnym |access-date=2011-04-05 |language=pl |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="legend">{{cite book |title=Legendy województwa białostockiego, łomżyńskiego, suwalskiego |publisher=Wojewódzka Biblioteka Publiczna im.

From 1547, the settlement was owned by the Wiesiołowski family, which founded the first school.<ref name=JK>Jacek Kusznier, ''Elektrycy w historii Politechniki Białostockiej'', "Maszyny Elektryczne - Zeszyty Problemowe", Nr 4/2018, p. 163 (in Polish)</ref> The first brick church and a castle were built between 1617 and 1826.

===Industrial growth===

Białystok received city rights the latest from all of Podlasie's cities, but at the end of the 19th century it outgrown all the surrounding cities. The rapid development in the 19th century is related to two historical events: the creation of a customs border between the Russian Empire and the Congress Kingdom of Poland, and the opening in 1862 of the [[Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway|Warsaw Saint Petersburg railway line]], connecting Białystok with [[Warsaw]], [[Grodno]], [[Vilnius]] and [[Saint Petersburg]]. Very convenient communication conditions influenced the development and concentration of Białystok's production plants at that time. Along with the administrative function, Białystok received many economic institutions. In the second half of the 19th century, Białystok grew into a significant center of the [[textile industry]], the largest after [[Łódź]] in then-partitioned Poland. Białystok was the largest industrial center between Warsaw and Łódź in the west, Saint Petersburg in the north and [[Moscow]] in the east, and was nicknamed "[[Manchester]] of the North".<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Dobroński|first=Adam|year=2011|title=Białystok na Syberii|magazine=Medyk Białostocki|volume=11 |language=pl|issue=103|page=31}}</ref> After the failed [[November Uprising|November]] and [[January Uprising|January]] uprisings, [[Russification of Poles during the Partitions|Russification]] policies and [[Anti-Polish sentiment|anti-Polish]] repressions intensified, and after 1870 a ban on the use of Polish in public places was introduced.<ref name=BST/> In 1912, a Tsarist prison was built, which also served as a transit prison for Poles [[Sybirak|deported to Siberia]].<ref name=gr>{{cite web|url=https://zabytek.pl/pl/obiekty/bialystok-zespol-wiezienia-carskiego-ob-areszt-sledczy|title=Zespół więzienia carskiego, ob. areszt śledczy|website=Zabytek.pl|author=Grażyna Rogala|access-date=6 September 2021|language=pl|archive-date=6 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210906182233/https://zabytek.pl/pl/obiekty/bialystok-zespol-wiezienia-carskiego-ob-areszt-sledczy|url-status=live}}</ref>

While winters are rather mild compared to other cities on the similar latitude, such as [[Samara]], [[Barnaul]], or [[Edmonton]], they are colder than in [[Western Europe]] (in cities like [[Bremen]] and [[Dublin]]). Winters usually have little sunshine, with weather patterns changing from those influenced by the [[Low Pressure Systems|low-pressure systems]] generated by the [[Icelandic Low]] (when the weather is often cloudy, cool, damp, rainy and/or snowy) to the occasional intrusions of cold air masses from [[Siberia]] or the [[Arctic]] ([[Siberian High]]), which, due to the city's northeasterly location, are more frequent than in other parts of Poland.<ref name=":0" /> Winters thus tend to be several degrees colder than elsewhere in Poland.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Mapy klimatu Polski - Portal Klimat IMGW-PiB|url=https://klimat.imgw.pl/pl/climate-maps/#Mean_Temperature/Seasonal/1991-2020/1/Winter|access-date=2022-02-12|website=klimat.imgw.pl|archive-date=2022-02-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220212141859/https://klimat.imgw.pl/pl/climate-maps/#Mean_Temperature/Seasonal/1991-2020/1/Winter|url-status=live}}</ref> Freezing conditions below {{convert|-20|°C|0|abbr=on}} are possible in winter but are rare.<ref name=":1" /> Snow cover is present on the ground for more than half of winter.

The centre of Białystok, as most urban areas, experiences the [[urban heat island effect]], therefore for most of the time, the city is warmer than the surrounding countryside. The temperatures in the city centre are, on average, {{Convert|2.3|C-change|F-change|abbr=on}} higher than in the surrounding villages, with greater differences at night and during the warmer half of the year, particularly in spring.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Czubaszek|first1=Robert|last2=Wysocka-Czubaszek|first2=Agnieszka|date=2016|title=URBAN HEAT ISLAND IN BIAŁYSTOK|url=http://www.journalssystem.com/jeeng/URBAN-HEAT-ISLAND-IN-BIALYSTOK,63323,0,2.html|journal=Journal of Ecological Engineering|volume=17|issue=3|pages=60–65|doi=10.12911/22998993/63323|issn=2299-8993|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Urban layout===
[[File:20200508 090415 Rynek Kościuszki in Białystok May 2020.jpg|thumb|[[Kościuszko Market Square|Kościuszko Square]] in 2020]]
Białystok is roughly circular, centered around the [[Kościuszko Market Square|Central market square]] and [[Branicki Palace, Białystok|Branicki Palace]]. The decisive influence on the development of the city was exerted by natural and human factors - the course of roads, the [[Biała (Supraśl)|Biała]] and its tributaries and the layout of railway lines. The choice of land for the construction of the factory was also determined by the price of the plot. The layout of the city, in accordance with the 18th century palace and park layout, emphasizing the magnificence of the residence, hindered the development of the city in width. Two railway lines: Białystok-Suwałki and Białystok-Słonim, separated its northern and eastern parts from the rest of the city: Dziesięciny, Wygoda, Zacisze, Pieczurki. Originally, the city's territory was about 50 hectares. In its early days Białystok was located at the intersection of two local roads and had two most important monuments: a church (with the current brick church from 1626) with an [[Kościuszko Market Square|accompanying market square]] and a Gothic castle owned by the noble Wiesiołowski family, the former owners of the town. The project which was aimed at rebuilding the layout of the city was initiated by Stefan Mikołaj Branicki at the end of the 17th and early 18th centuries. He established a new market ({{langx|pl|Nowy Rynek}}) (part of the western side of [[Kościuszko Square, Białystok|Kosciuszki Square]] with the town hall, located on the western side of [[Sienkiewicza Street, Białystok|Sienkiewicza Street]]). The route leading towards [[Suraż]] was moved to a new location (today's Suraska Street) forming straight road section ending in the southern corner of the market square and creating a new viewing corridor. This design decision made it possible to erect new buildings so that the old part of the settlement and the [[History of the Jews in Białystok|Jewish quarter]] were no longer visible. The second viewing corridor was created by shifting the [[Lipowa Street, Białystok|existing route leading towards Choroszcz]] to the northern corner of the market square.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://zabytek.pl/en/obiekty/bialystok-uklad-urbanistyczny|title=Part of the urban area|author=Grażyna Rogala|accessdate=2023-09-07|date=2014-12-23|publisher=Regional Branch of the National Heritage Board of Poland in Białystok}}</ref>

The communication system serving the entire city was made of streets radiating out from the [[Kościuszko Square in Białystok|central market square]]. An inventory plan made by Becker in 1799 was needed by the Prussian authorities in connection with the negotiations on the acquisition of Białystok for a royal residence. The plan is of fundamental importance as it shows the development of the city in the first period of its creation. The area of the city did not exceed 1.5 km2, and the population was approx. 3.5 thousand. The entire urban area was closed with 6 loose-fitting gates and buildings situated on regular plots. Compact buildings were found only in the market square, the frontages of which were 1- 2-storey buildings with brick front elevations. [[Lipowa Street, Białystok|Choroska]] and Zamkowa Streets were built up with only brick houses. The city was dominated by the palace complex, which, together with the park, covered a substantial area. The residence palace was designed on a European scale and created new development opportunities for Białystok.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Z badań nad zmianami struktury przestrzennej miasta Białegostoku|journal=Rocznik Białostocki|issue=18|year=1993|pages=432–435}}</ref> Following the handover of the city from the Prussian Kingdom to the [[Russian Empire]] in the early 19th century, the city began growing in a very fast pace as a result of intensive industrialization, losing its original Baroque composition.<ref>{{cite book|title=Białystok w dwudziestoleciu międzywojennym|lang=pl|pages=234–235|last1=Samsel|first1=Agata}}</ref> 

After the [[First World War]], the first attempts were made to organize the city, which had so far developed without plans - between the palace grounds and arable land. At the request of the Association of Polish Cities, in the years 1938-1939 a general urban concept of the city was created by Ignacy Tłoczek. The plan called for the creation of new communication routes, relieve the center, demolish the Chanajki district, create a housing estate and connect with it the unique green areas around the city with new tree plantings. The Second World War prevented the comprehensive implementation of this plan. In addition, in 1919 the city's territory was significantly expanded, incorporating the surrounding villages with plans of expanding the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://plus.poranny.pl/jak-powstal-wielki-bialystok-w-1919-roku-do-miasta-przylaczono-kilkanascie-wsi/ar/c1-14163461|title=Jak powstał Wielki Białystok?

The average height of buildings in the city is not high. The center is dominated by buildings not exceeding 25 meters in height, and the outskirts of the city are mainly occupied by low-rise single-family houses. Taller buildings dominate in some residential districts such as the districts of Piasta [[Osiedle Piasta I, Białystok|I]] and [[Osiedle Piasta II, Białystok|II]] (located to the south of the city center), Dziesięciny [[Osiedle Dziesięciny I, Białystok|I]] and [[Osiedle Dziesięciny II, Białystok|II]] estates (located to the northwest of the city center) as well as [[Osiedle Wysoki Stoczek, Białystok|Wysoki Stoczek]] and [[Osiedle Słoneczny Stok, Białystok|Słoneczny Stok]]. Dominants in Białystok are located mainly in the center and they are also there located two most important city icons: the [[St. Roch's Church, Białystok|St. Roch's Church]] and the [[Białystok Cathedral]], which are on one axis. Each of the districts also has its dominant, which is usually a church or an Orthodox church. The most important space in the city is [[Kościuszko Square in Białystok|Kościuszko Square]] - the main square in the shape of a triangle. The space is delimited by two axes, one is part of the axis connecting the two largest churches, and the other runs towards the west of the Center district along Suraska Street and ends at Młynowa Street. An important spatial arrangement in Białystok is the Branicki Palace complex. The Baroque layout of the palace complex is symmetrically shaped according to one compositional axis with a coherent garden layout.<ref>[rewitalizacja ulicy Młynowej w Białymstoku]</ref>

Throughout the years it expanded to include nearby villages: In the mid-eighteenth century [[Osiedle Bojary, Białystok|Bojary]] which was located on the right bank of the Biala River was incorporated to it. On May 10, 1919, in accordance with the decision of the Sejm, [[Białostoczek (Białystok)|Bialostoczek]], [[Horodniany]], Zwierzyniec-Letnisko, [[Osiedle Starosielce, Białystok|Starosielce]], [[Słoboda, Podlaskie Voivodeship|Słoboda]] (which was founded at the end of the 17th century, between the current Pogodna and Świerkowa Streets), Ogrodniki, Pieczurki, [[Osiedle Wysoki Stoczek, Białystok|Wysoki Stoczek]] were incorporated also, as well as two mill villages Marczuk and [[Osiedle Antoniuk, Białystok|Antoniuk]]. By the onset of [[World War II]] the city's territory amounted to 40&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://poranny.pl/sloboda-byla-wsia-mieszkancy-mieli-tu-gospodarstwa/ar/4933253|title=Słoboda była wsią.

The 70s saw another wave of expansion with the villages of [[Osiedle Bagnówka, Białystok|Bagnówka]], area of Zakłady Silikatowe, areas of state forests, Dojlidy ponds and the orthodox cemetery at Dojlidy. At the onset of the millennium, in 2002, the village [[Osiedle Zawady, Białystok|Zawady]] was included in the city's limits and at the last enlargement, in 2006, the villages Dojlidy Górne, Zagórki and Kolonia Halickie were incorporated and the city reached its current territory of 102&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tokajuk|first1=Jerzy|title=Konflikty przestrzenne na styku istniejacej zabudowy zagrodowej i planowanej zabudowy mieszkaniowej na terenach wsi strefy podmiejskiej wlaczonych do obszaru miasta Bialoegostoku|pages=312–313}}</ref>

Historically, Białystok has been a destination for internal and foreign immigration, especially from [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]]. In addition to the [[Polish people|Polish minority]], there was formerly a Jewish majority in Białystok. The Jewish share in the population of Białystok grew from 22.4% (761) in 1765 to 66.6% (6,000) in 1808 and 76% (47,783) in 1895.<ref name="Wrobel" /> According to the [[Russian Empire Census|Russian census of 1897]], out of the total population of 66,000, [[Jews]] constituted 41,900 (around 63% percent).<ref name="zimmerman" /> According to the German census of 1916, Jews comprised about 72% of the inhabitants (no less than 40,000). The demographic situation changed due to the influx of Polish repatriants, [[intelligentsia]] and civil servants, and the enlargement of the city after the [[World War I]].<ref name="Wrobel">{{cite journal |last1=Wróbel |first1=Piotr |title=Na równi pochyłej.

Most other Polish cities have suffered similarly, but the processes in Białystok, have had a particularly intense course.

Very few historic buildings of the city have been preserved – the sights are merely an echo of the old historical shape of Białystok.<ref name="rising">{{cite web | url=http://www.bialystok.pl/1108-bialystok-2006-2010/default.aspx | title=Białystok 2006–2010 | access-date=2011-05-23 | language=pl | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816231334/http://www.bialystok.pl/1108-bialystok-2006-2010/default.aspx | archive-date=2011-08-16 | url-status=dead }}</ref>
