As a result of the annexation of neighbouring chiefdoms, the artists and scholars from these places migrated to Thiruvananthapuram, turning it into a cultural center. Marthanda Varma gave patronage to different temple art forms including ''Koothu'', ''Padhakam'', ''Kathakali'', ''Thullal'', and ''Koodiyattam''.

The city developed into a significant intellectual and artistic centre during this period. The city's golden age was during the mid-19th century under the reign of [[Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma|Maharaja Swathi Thirunal]] and [[Ayilyam Thirunal|Maharaja Ayilyam Thirunal]]. This era saw the establishment of the first English school (1834), the [[Trivandrum Observatory|Observatory]] (1837), the General Hospital (1839), [[the Oriental Research Institute & Manuscripts Library]] and the University College (1873). The first mental hospital in the state was started during the same period. [[Sanskrit College]], Ayurveda College, [[Law College]] and a second-grade college for women were started by [[Moolam Thirunal]] (1885–1924).<ref name="History of Thiruvananthapuram">{{cite web |publisher=Govt. of Kerala |url=http://www.corporationoftrivandrum.in/about-corporation |title=About Corporation |access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref>

The early 20th century was an age of tremendous political and social changes in the city. The [[Sree Moolam Popular Assembly]], established in 1904, was the first democratically elected legislative council in any Indian state.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of legislative bodies in Kerala-- Sri Mulam Popular Assembly |url=http://keralaassembly.org/history/popular.html |publisher=Keralaassembly |access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref> Despite not being under the direct control of the [[British Empire]] at any time, the city featured prominently in [[Indian independence movement|India's freedom struggle]]. The [[Indian National Congress]] had a very active presence in Thiruvananthapuram. A meeting of the Indian National Congress presided by Dr [[Pattabhi Sitaramaiah]] was held here in 1938.

The Thiruvananthapuram Municipality came into existence in 1920 as the first municipality in the [[Travancore]] region.

With the end of British rule in 1947, Travancore chose to join the Indian union. The first popularly elected ministry, headed by [[Pattom Thanu Pillai]], was installed in office on 24 March 1948. In 1949, Thiruvananthapuram became the capital of [[Travancore-Cochin|Thiru-Kochi]], the state formed by the integration of Travancore with its northern neighbour, the [[Kingdom of Cochin|Kochi]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Criminal Justice India Series: Kerala, 2001 |author=West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences |year=2002 |publisher=Allied Publishers |isbn=978-81-7764-391-6 |page=5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_2r8cLTkmA8C&pg=PA5}}</ref> The king of [[Travancore]], [[Chitra Thirunal Bala Rama Varma]], became the [[Rajpramukh]] of the [[Travancore-Cochin|Travancore-Cochin Union]] from 1 July 1949 until 31 October 1956.
