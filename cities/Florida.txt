'''Florida''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|l|ɒr|ɪ|d|ə||audio=En-us-Florida.ogg}} {{respell|FLORR|ih|də}}, {{IPA|es|floˈɾiða|lang}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Southeastern United States|Southeastern]] region of the [[United States]]. It borders the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the west, [[Alabama]] to the northwest, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] to the north, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east, and the [[Straits of Florida]] and [[Cuba]] to the south. About two-thirds of Florida occupies a peninsula between the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It has the [[List of U.S. states by coastline|longest coastline]] in the [[contiguous United States]], spanning approximately {{convert|1,350|mi|km}}, not including its many [[barrier island]]s. It is the only state that borders both the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. With a population of over 21 million, it is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|third-most populous state in the United States]] and ranks [[List of states and territories of the United States by population density|eighth in population density]] as of 2020. Florida spans {{convert|65758|sqmi|km2}}, ranking [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|22nd in area]] among the states. The [[Miami metropolitan area]], anchored by the cities of [[Miami]], [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida|Fort Lauderdale]], and [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]], is the state's largest [[metropolitan statistical area|metropolitan area]], with a population of 6.138 million; the most populous city is [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]]. Florida's other major population centers include [[Tampa Bay area|Tampa Bay]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Cape Coral, Florida|Cape Coral]], and the state capital of [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]].

Various American Indian tribes have inhabited Florida for at least 14,000 years. In 1513, [[Spaniards|Spanish]] explorer [[Juan Ponce de León]] became the first known European to make landfall, calling the region ''La Florida'' (land of flowers) ([[Help:IPA/Spanish|''[la floˈɾiða]'']]). Florida subsequently became the first area in the continental U.S. to be permanently settled by Europeans, with the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], founded in 1565, being the oldest continuously inhabited city. Florida was frequently attacked and coveted by [[Great Britain]] before Spain [[Adams–Onís Treaty|ceded it to the U.S.]] in 1819 in exchange for resolving the border dispute along the [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine River]] in [[Spanish Texas]]. Florida was admitted as the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|27th state]] on March 3, 1845, and was the principal location of the [[Seminole Wars]] (1816–1858), the longest and most extensive of the [[American Indian Wars]]. The state seceded from [[Union (American Civil War)|the Union]] on January 10, 1861, becoming one of the seven original [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]], and was readmitted to the Union after the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] on June 25, 1868.

Since the mid-20th century, Florida has experienced rapid demographic and economic growth. [[Economy of Florida|Its economy]], with a [[gross state product]] (GSP) of $1.647 trillion, is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by GDP|fourth largest of any U.S. state]] and the 15th-largest in the world; the main sectors are [[tourism]], [[Hospitality industry|hospitality]], [[agriculture]], real estate, and [[Transportation in Florida|transportation]]. Florida is world-renowned for its [[beach resort]]s, [[amusement park]]s, warm and sunny climate, and nautical recreation; attractions such as [[Walt Disney World]], the [[Kennedy Space Center]], and [[Miami Beach, Florida|Miami Beach]] draw tens of millions of visitors annually. Florida is a popular destination for [[Pensioner|retirees]], [[Snowbird (person)|seasonal vacationers]], and both domestic and international migrants; it hosts nine out of the ten fastest-growing communities in the U.S. The state's close proximity to the ocean has shaped [[Florida culture|its culture]], identity, and daily life; its colonial history and successive waves of migration are reflected in [[African American|African]], [[European American|European]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]], and [[Asian Americans|Asian]] influences. Florida has attracted or inspired some of the most prominent American writers, including [[Ernest Hemingway]], [[Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings]], and [[Tennessee Williams]], and continues to attract celebrities and athletes, especially in [[golf]], [[tennis]], [[auto racing]], and [[List of water sports|water sports]]. Florida has been considered a [[swing state|battleground state]] in [[United States presidential election|American presidential elections]], particularly those in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]] and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]].

Florida's climate varies from [[subtropical]] in the north to [[tropical]] in the south. It is the only state besides [[Hawaii]] to have a [[tropical climate]], and the only continental state with both a tropical climate, located at the southern portion of the state, and a [[coral reef]]. Florida has several unique ecosystems, including [[Everglades National Park]], the largest tropical wilderness in the U.S. and among the largest in the [[Americas]]. Unique wildlife include the [[American alligator]], [[American crocodile]], [[American flamingo]], [[Roseate spoonbill]], [[Florida panther]], [[Common bottlenose dolphin|bottlenose dolphin]], and [[West Indian manatee|manatee]]. The [[Florida Reef]] is the only living [[Coral reef|coral barrier reef]] in the continental United States, and the third-largest coral barrier reef system in the world, after the [[Great Barrier Reef]] and the [[Belize Barrier Reef]].

Florida was the first region of what is now the [[contiguous United States]] to be visited and settled by Europeans. The earliest known European explorers came with [[Juan Ponce de León]]. Ponce de León spotted and landed on the peninsula on April 2, 1513. He named it ''[[Spanish Florida|Florida]]'' (colloquially la Florida) in recognition of the flowery, verdant landscape and because it was the [[Easter]] season, which the [[Spaniards]] called ''[[Pascua Florida]]'' (Festival of Flowers).

In May 1539, [[Hernando de Soto]] skirted the coast of Florida, searching for a deep harbor to land. He described a thick wall of red mangroves spread mile after mile, some reaching as high as {{convert|70|ft}}, with intertwined and elevated roots making landing difficult.<ref>Davidson, James West.

In 1559, Don [[Tristán de Luna y Arellano]] established a settlement at present-day [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], making it one of the first settlements in Florida, but it was mostly abandoned by 1561.

In 1564–1565, there was a French settlement at [[Fort Caroline]], in present [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]], which was destroyed by the Spanish.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Paul E. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/20594668 |title=A New Andalucia and a Way to the Orient: the American Southeast During the Sixteenth Century |publisher=Louisiana State University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-8071-1552-5 |location=Baton Rouge |pages=278 |oclc=20594668}}</ref> Today a reconstructed version of the fort stands in its location within Jacksonville.

In 1565, the settlement of [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] (San Agustín) was established under the leadership of admiral and governor [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]], creating what would become the oldest, continuously occupied European settlements in the continental U.S. and establishing the first generation of Floridanos and the [[List of colonial governors of Florida|Government of Florida]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://losfloridanos.org/|title=Los Floridanos|website=Los Floridanos|access-date=August 23, 2019|archive-date=November 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201114000917/http://www.losfloridanos.org/|url-status=live}}</ref> The marriage between Luisa de Abrego, a free black domestic servant from Seville, and Miguel Rodríguez, a white Segovian, occurred in 1565 in St. Augustine.

Some Floridanos married or had unions with [[Pensacola people|Pensacola]], [[Muscogee|Creek]], or [[List of ethnic groups of Africa|African]] women, both slave and free, and their descendants created a mixed-race population of [[mestizo]]s and [[mulatto]]es. The Spanish encouraged [[Slavery in the colonial United States|slaves]] from the [[Thirteen Colonies]] to come to Florida as a refuge, promising freedom in exchange for conversion to [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]]. [[Charles II of Spain|King Charles II of Spain]] issued a royal proclamation freeing all slaves who fled to Florida and accepted conversion and baptism. Most went to the area around [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], but [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|escaped slaves]] also reached Pensacola. St. Augustine had mustered an all-black militia unit defending Florida as early as 1683.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.nps.gov/articles/sanctuary-in-the-spanish-empire.htm|title=Sanctuary in the Spanish Empire: An African American officer earns freedom in Florida|author=Gene Allen Smith, Texas Christian University|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=April 5, 2018|archive-date=January 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210110103703/https://www.nps.gov/articles/sanctuary-in-the-spanish-empire.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The geographical area of Spanish claims in Florida diminished with the establishment of English settlements to the north and French claims to the west. English colonists and [[buccaneer]]s launched several attacks on St. Augustine in the 17th and 18th centuries, razing the city and its cathedral to the ground several times. Spain built the [[Castillo de San Marcos]] in 1672 and [[Fort Matanzas]] in 1742 to defend Florida's capital city from attacks, and to maintain its strategic position in the defense of the [[Captaincy General of Cuba]] and the [[Spanish West Indies]].

In 1738, the [[List of colonial governors of Florida|governor of Florida]] [[Manuel de Montiano]] established [[Fort Mose Historic State Park|Fort Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose]] near St. Augustine, a fortified town for escaped slaves to whom Montiano granted citizenship and freedom in return for their service in the Florida militia, and which became the first free black settlement legally sanctioned in North America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/underground/fl2.htm|title=Aboard the Underground Railroad—Fort Mose Site|first=Sarah Dillard|last=Pope|website=Nps.gov|access-date=July 19, 2016|archive-date=April 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426210615/http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/travel/underground/fl2.htm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortmose.org/|title=Fort Mose Historical Society|access-date=July 18, 2016|archive-date=July 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160707201925/http://www.fortmose.org/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In [[Timeline of Florida History|1763]], Spain traded Florida to the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] for control of [[Havana]], [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], which [[Siege of Havana|had been captured]] by the British during the [[Seven Years' War]]. The trade was done as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|1763 Treaty of Paris]] which ended the Seven Years' War. Spain was granted [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Louisiana]] from France due to their loss of Florida. A large portion of the Florida population left, taking along large portions of the remaining Indigenous population with them to Cuba.<ref>{{cite web |author=Florida Center for Instructional Technology |url=http://fcit.usf.edu/Florida/docs/f/florbrit.htm |title=Floripedia: Florida: As a British territory |publisher=Fcit.usf.edu |access-date=October 2, 2009 |archive-date=December 13, 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121213002156/http://fcit.usf.edu/Florida/docs/f/florbrit.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The British soon constructed the [[King's Road (Florida)|King's Road]] connecting St. Augustine to [[Province of Georgia|Georgia]].

Caroline Mays Brevard, Henry Eastman Bennett p. 77</ref> The British government gave land grants to officers and soldiers who had fought in the [[French and Indian War]] in order to encourage settlement. In order to induce settlers to move to Florida, reports of its natural wealth were published in England. A number of British settlers who were described as being "energetic and of good character" moved to Florida, mostly coming from [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and England. There was also a group of settlers who came from the colony of [[Bermuda]]. This was the first permanent English-speaking population in what is now [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]], [[Baker County, Florida|Baker County]], [[St. Johns County, Florida|St. Johns County]] and [[Nassau County, Florida|Nassau County]]. The British constructed good public roads and introduced the cultivation of sugar cane, indigo and fruits, as well as the export of lumber.<ref name="A History of Florida">''A History of Florida''.

The British governors were directed to call general assemblies as soon as possible in order to make laws for the Floridas, and in the meantime they were, with the advice of councils, to establish courts. This was the first introduction of the English-derived legal system which Florida still has today, including [[Jury trial|trial by jury]], [[habeas corpus]] and county-based government.<ref name="A History of Florida"/><ref name="The Land Policy in British East Florida"/> Neither East Florida nor West Florida sent any representatives to Philadelphia to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]].

Defense of Florida's northern border with the United States was minor during the second Spanish period. The region became a haven for escaped slaves and a base for Indian attacks against U.S. territories, and the U.S. pressed Spain for reform.

Americans of [[English Americans|English]] and [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scots Irish descent]] began moving into northern Florida from the backwoods of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[South Carolina]]. Though technically not allowed by the government authorities, they were never able to effectively police the border region and the backwoods settlers from the United States would continue to immigrate into Florida unchecked. These migrants, mixing with the already present British settlers who had remained in Florida since the British period, would be the progenitors of the population known as [[Florida Cracker]]s.<ref>Ste Claire, Dana (2006). ''Cracker: Cracker Culture in Florida History''. University Press of Florida. {{ISBN|978-0-8130-3028-9}}</ref>

These American settlers established a permanent foothold in the area. The British settlers who had remained also resented Spanish governance, leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for ninety days of the so-called Free and Independent [[Republic of West Florida]] on September 23. After meetings beginning in June, rebels overcame the garrison at [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] (now in [[Louisiana]]) and unfurled the flag of the new republic: a single white star on a blue field. This flag would later become known as the "[[Bonnie Blue Flag]]".

In 1810, parts of West Florida were annexed by the proclamation of President [[James Madison]], who claimed the region as part of the [[Louisiana Purchase]]. These parts were incorporated into the newly formed [[Territory of Orleans]]. The U.S. annexed the Mobile District of West Florida to the [[Mississippi Territory]] in 1812. Spain continued to dispute the area, though the United States gradually increased the area it occupied. In 1812, a group of settlers from Georgia, with de facto support from the U.S. federal government, attempted to overthrow the Floridan government in the province of East Florida. The settlers hoped to convince Floridians to join their cause and proclaim independence from Spain, but the settlers lost their tenuous support from the federal government and abandoned their cause by 1813.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.floridamemory.com/collections/constitution/|title=Florida's Early Constitutions—Florida Memory|access-date=July 16, 2017|archive-date=August 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827045025/https://www.floridamemory.com/collections/constitution/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Traditionally, historians argued that [[Seminole]]s based in [[East Florida]] began raiding Georgia settlements and offering havens for runaway slaves. The [[United States Army]] led increasingly frequent incursions into Spanish territory, including the 1817–1818 campaign against the Seminole Indians by [[Andrew Jackson]] that became known as the [[First Seminole War]]. The United States now effectively controlled East Florida. Control was necessary according to Secretary of State [[John Quincy Adams]] because Florida had become "a derelict open to the occupancy of every enemy, civilized or savage, of the United States, and serving no other earthly purpose than as a post of annoyance to them."<ref>Alexander Deconde, ''A History of American Foreign Policy'' (1963) p. 127</ref>

[[File:Seminole War in Everglades.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] boat searching the [[Everglades]] for [[Seminole]]s (hiding in foreground) during the [[Second Seminole War]], which lasted from 1835 to 1842]]
More recent historians describe that after U.S. independence, settlers in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] increased pressure on Seminole lands, and skirmishes near the border led to the [[First Seminole War]] (1816–1819). The United States purchased Florida from Spain by the [[Adams-Onis Treaty]] (1819) and took possession in 1821. The Seminole were moved out of their rich farmland in northern Florida and confined to a large reservation in the interior of the Florida peninsula by the [[Treaty of Moultrie Creek]] (1823). Passage of the [[Indian Removal Act]] (1830) led to the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]] (1832), which called for the relocation of all Seminole to [[Indian Territory]] (now [[Oklahoma]]).<ref>Mahon, pp. 190–191.</ref> Some resisted, leading to the [[Second Seminole War]], the bloodiest [[American Indian Wars|war against Native Americans]] in United States history. By 1842, most Seminoles and Black Seminoles, facing starvation, were removed to Indian Territory west of the [[Mississippi River]]. Perhaps fewer than 200 Seminoles remained in Florida after the [[Third Seminole War]] (1855–1858), having taken refuge in the Everglades, from where they never surrendered to the US. They fostered a resurgence in traditional customs and a culture of staunch independence.<ref>Mahon, pp. 201–202</ref>

Florida had become a burden to Spain, which could not afford to send settlers or troops due to the devastation caused by the [[Peninsular War]]. Madrid, therefore, decided to cede the territory to the United States through the [[Adams–Onís Treaty]], which took effect in 1821.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tebeau | first=Charlton W. | author-link=Charlton W.

By the early 1800s, [[Indian removal]] was a significant issue throughout the southeastern U.S. and also in Florida. In 1830, the U.S. Congress passed the [[Indian Removal Act]] and as settlement increased, pressure grew on the U.S. government to remove the Indians from Florida. Seminoles offered sanctuary to blacks, and these became known as the [[Black Seminoles]], and clashes between whites and Indians grew with the influx of new settlers. In 1832, the [[Treaty of Payne's Landing]] promised to the Seminoles lands west of the Mississippi River if they agreed to leave Florida. Many Seminole left at this time.

Some Seminoles remained, and the U.S. Army arrived in Florida, leading to the [[Second Seminole War]] (1835–1842). Following the war, approximately 3,000 Seminole and 800 Black Seminole were removed to [[Indian Territory]]. A few hundred Seminole remained in Florida in the [[Everglades]].

On March 3, 1845, only one day before the end of President [[John Tyler]]'s term in office, Florida became the 27th state,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=005/llsl005.db&recNum=779|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774–1875|website=Library of Congress|access-date=July 21, 2015|archive-date=June 19, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619031820/http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsl&fileName=005%2Fllsl005.db&recNum=779|url-status=live}}</ref> admitted as a [[slave state]] and no longer a sanctuary for runaway slaves.

As European settlers continued to encroach on Seminole lands, the United States intervened to move the remaining Seminoles to the West. The [[Third Seminole War]] (1855–1858) resulted in the [[Trail of Tears|forced removal]] of most of the remaining Seminoles, although hundreds of Seminole Indians remained in the Everglades.<ref>Tindall, George Brown, and David Emory Shi. (edition unknown) ''America: A Narrative History''. W. W. Norton & Company. 412. {{ISBN|978-0-393-96874-3}}</ref>

The first settlements and towns in South Florida were founded much later than those in the northern part of the state. The first permanent European settlers arrived in the early 19th century. People came from the [[Bahamas]] to South Florida and the [[Florida Keys|Keys]] to hunt for treasure from the ships that ran aground on the treacherous Great [[Florida Reef]]. Some accepted Spanish land offers along the Miami River. At about the same time, the [[Seminole]] Indians arrived, along with a group of runaway slaves. The area was affected by the [[Second Seminole War]], during which Major [[William S. Harney]] led several raids against the Indians. Most non-Indian residents were soldiers stationed at [[Fort Dallas]]. It was the most devastating Indian war in American history, causing almost a total loss of population in Miami.

After the Second Seminole War ended in 1842, William English re-established a plantation started by his uncle on the [[Miami River (Florida)|Miami River]]. He charted the "Village of Miami" on the south bank of the Miami River and sold several plots of land. In 1844, Miami became the county seat, and six years later a census reported there were ninety-six residents in the area.<ref>[http://www.miamidade.gov/info/history.asp History of Miami-Dade county] retrieved January 26, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110194202/http://www.miamidade.gov/info/history.asp |date=January 10, 2006 }}</ref> The [[Seminole Wars#Third Seminole War|Third Seminole War]] was not as destructive as the second, but it slowed the settlement of southeast Florida.

American settlers began to establish cotton [[plantations in the American South|plantations]] in north Florida, which required numerous laborers, which they supplied by buying slaves in the domestic market. By 1860, Florida had only 140,424 people, of whom 44% were enslaved. There were fewer than 1,000 free [[free black|African Americans]] before the American Civil War.<ref>[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, Retrieved October 31, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070823030234/http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php |date=August 23, 2007 }}</ref>

The ordinance declared Florida's secession from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]], allowing it to become one of the founding members of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate States]].

The Confederacy received little military help from Florida; the 15,000 troops it offered were generally sent elsewhere. Instead of troops and manufactured goods, Florida did provide salt and, more importantly, beef to feed the Confederate armies. This was particularly important after 1864, when the Confederacy lost control of the Mississippi River, thereby losing access to Texas beef.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.floridamemory.com/onlineclassroom/floridacivilwar/|title=Florida in the Civil War|first=State Library and Archives of|last=Florida|website=Florida Memory|access-date=May 19, 2019|archive-date=April 2, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402212938/https://www.floridamemory.com/onlineclassroom/floridacivilwar/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Taylor, R.

In the pre-automobile era, railroads played a key role in the state's development, particularly in coastal areas. In 1883, the [[Pensacola and Atlantic Railroad]] connected Pensacola and the rest of the [[Florida Panhandle|Panhandle]] to the rest of the state. In 1884 the [[South Florida Railroad]] (later absorbed by [[Atlantic Coast Line Railroad]]) opened full service to [[Tampa]]. In 1894 the [[Florida East Coast Railway]] reached [[West Palm Beach]]; in 1896 it reached [[Biscayne Bay]] near [[Miami]]. Numerous other railroads were built all over the interior of the state.

Economic prosperity in the 1920s stimulated tourism to Florida and related development of hotels and resort communities. Combined with its sudden elevation in profile was the [[Florida land boom of the 1920s]], which brought a brief period of intense land development. In 1925, the [[Seaboard Air Line]] broke the FEC's southeast Florida monopoly and extended its freight and passenger service to West Palm Beach; two years later it extended passenger service to Miami. Devastating hurricanes in [[1926 Miami hurricane|1926]] and [[1928 Okeechobee hurricane|1928]], followed by the [[Great Depression]], brought that period to a halt. Florida's economy did not fully recover until the military buildup for [[World War II]].

It is bordered on the north by [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Alabama]], and on the west, at the end of the panhandle, by Alabama. It is the only state that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico. Florida also is the southernmost of the 48 contiguous states, [[Hawaii]] being the only one of the fifty states reaching farther south. Florida is west of the [[The Bahamas|Bahamas]] and {{convert|90|mi}} north of [[Cuba]].

Florida is mostly [[Christians|Christian]] (70%),<ref name="pew2014"/> although there is a large [[irreligious]] and relatively significant [[Jewish]] community. [[Protestantism|Protestants]] account for almost half of the population, but the [[Catholic Church]] is the largest single denomination in the state mainly due to its large [[Hispanic]] population and other groups like [[Haitians]]. Protestants are very diverse, although [[Baptists]], [[Methodists]], [[Pentecostals]] and [[nondenominational Protestants]] are the largest groups. Smaller Christian groups include [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Florida|The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]. There is also a sizable [[American Jews|Jewish]] community in [[South Florida]].

The basic structure, duties, function, and operations of the government of the State of Florida are defined by the [[Florida Constitution]], which establishes the basic law of the state and guarantees various rights and freedoms of the people. As with the American federal government and all other state governments, Florida's government consists of three separate branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The legislature enacts bills, which, if signed by the [[Governor of Florida|governor]], become [[Florida Statutes|law]].

The [[Florida Legislature]] comprises the [[Florida Senate]], which has 40 members, and the [[Florida House of Representatives]], which has 120 members. The governor of Florida is [[Ron DeSantis]]. The [[Florida Supreme Court]] consists of a chief justice and six justices.

Florida has 67 [[County (United States)|counties]]. Some reference materials may show only 66 because [[Duval County, Florida|Duval County]] is consolidated with the [[City of Jacksonville]]. There are 379 cities in Florida (out of 411) that report regularly to the Florida Department of Revenue, but there are other incorporated municipalities that do not. The primary revenue source for cities and counties is property tax; properties with unpaid taxes are subject to [[tax sale]]s, which are held at the county level in May and are highly popular, due to the extensive use of online bidding sites.

The state government's primary revenue source is sales tax. Florida is [[State income tax#States with no individual income tax|one of eight states]] that do not impose a personal [[income tax]].

There were 800 [[Federal Corrupt Practices Act|federal corruption]] convictions from 1988 to 2007, more than any other state.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Editorial:Culture of corruption |url=http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20110107/OPINION/110106021/Our-Views-Culture-of-corruption-Jan-7- |work=Florida Today |location=Melbourne, Florida |page=1A |date=January 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107202129/http://www.floridatoday.com/article/20110107/OPINION/110106021/Our-Views-Culture-of-corruption-Jan-7- |archive-date=January 7, 2014 }}</ref>

===Elections history===
{{Further|Elections in Florida|Politics of Florida|Political party strength in Florida|United States presidential elections in Florida}}
From 1952 to 1964, most voters were registered Democrats, but the state voted for the Republican presidential candidate in every election except for [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]]. The following year, Congress passed and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] signed the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], providing for oversight of state practices and enforcement of constitutional voting rights for African Americans and other minorities in order to prevent the discrimination and disenfranchisement which had excluded most of them for decades from the political process.

From the 1930s through much of the 1960s, Florida was essentially a one-party state dominated by white conservative Democrats, who together with other Democrats of the [[Solid South]], exercised considerable control in Congress. They have gained slightly less federal money from national programs than they have paid in taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://files.taxfoundation.org/legacy/docs/ftsbs-timeseries-20071016-.pdf|title=Alabama : Federal Taxes Paid vs. Federal Spending Received : 1981–present|website=Files.taxfoundation.org|access-date=October 23, 2018|archive-date=April 12, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412030238/https://files.taxfoundation.org/legacy/docs/ftsbs-timeseries-20071016-.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the 1970s, conservative white voters in the state have largely shifted from the Democratic to the Republican Party. Though the majority of registered voters in Florida were Democrats,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-registration-monthly-reports/voter-registration-current-by-county/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161024133158/http://dos.myflorida.com/elections/data-statistics/voter-registration-statistics/voter-registration-monthly-reports/voter-registration-current-by-county/|url-status=dead|archive-date=October 24, 2016|title=Voter Registration—Current by County—Division of Elections—Florida Department of State|date=October 24, 2016}}</ref> it continued to support Republican presidential candidates through 2004, except in [[1976 United States presidential election|1976]] and [[1996 United States presidential election|1996]], when the Democratic nominee was from [[Southern United States|the South]].

In the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]] and [[2012 United States presidential election|2012]] presidential elections, [[Barack Obama]] carried the state as a northern Democrat, attracting high voter turnout, especially among the young, independents, and minority voters, of whom [[Hispanics]] comprise an increasingly large proportion. 2008 marked the first time since 1944, when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] carried the state for the fourth time, that Florida was carried by a Northern Democrat for president.

The first post-[[Reconstruction era]] Republican elected to Congress from Florida was [[William C. Cramer]] in 1954 from Pinellas County on the Gulf Coast,<ref name="William C. Cramer, 81, a Leader Of G.O.P. Resurgence in South"/> where demographic changes were underway. In this period, African Americans were still [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised]] by the state's constitution and discriminatory practices; in the 19th century, they had made up most of the Republican Party. Cramer built a different Republican Party in Florida, attracting local white conservatives and transplants from northern and midwestern states. In 1966, [[Claude R. Kirk Jr.]] was elected as the first post-Reconstruction Republican governor, in an upset election.<ref name="Claude Roy Kirk Jr."/> In 1968, [[Edward J. Gurney]], also a white conservative, was elected as the state's first post-reconstruction Republican US senator.<ref name="E. J. Gurney, 82, Senator Who Backed Nixon"/> In 1970, Democrats took the governorship and the open US Senate seat and maintained dominance for years.

Florida is sometimes considered a bellwether state in presidential elections because every candidate who won the state from 1996 until 2016 won the election.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chris |first1=Moody |title=Florida is the true US presidential election bellwether state |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/1/florida-is-the-uss-true-presidential-election-bellwether |website=www.aljazeera.com |access-date=February 11, 2021 |archive-date=November 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201117071439/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/10/1/florida-is-the-uss-true-presidential-election-bellwether |url-status=live }}</ref> The 2020 election broke that streak when [[Donald Trump]] won Florida but lost the election.

In 1998, Democratic voters dominated areas of the state with a high percentage of racial minorities and transplanted white liberals from the northeastern United States, known colloquially as "snowbirds".<ref name="The New York Times"/> [[South Florida]] and the [[Miami metropolitan area]] became dominated by both racial minorities and white liberals. Because of this, the area has consistently voted as one of the most Democratic areas of the state. The Daytona Beach area is similar demographically and the city of Orlando has a large Hispanic population, which has often favored Democrats. Republicans, made up mostly of white conservatives, have dominated throughout much of the rest of Florida, including Jacksonville and the panhandle and particularly in the more rural and suburban areas. This is characteristic of its voter base throughout the [[Deep South]].<ref name="The New York Times" />

The fast-growing [[I-4 corridor]] area, which runs through [[Central Florida]] and connects the cities of [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]]/[[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], has had a fairly even breakdown of Republican and Democratic voters. The area has often been seen as a merging point of the conservative northern portion of the state and the liberal southern portion, making it the biggest swing area in the state. Since the late 20th century, the voting results in this area, containing 40% of Florida voters, has often determined who will win the state in federal presidential elections.<ref name="The Washington Times"/>

Historically, the Democratic Party maintained an edge in voter registration, both statewide and in the state's three most populous counties, [[Miami-Dade County]], [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], and [[Palm Beach County]].<ref name="Voter Registration by Party Affiliation and County"/>{{when|date=March 2022}}

====2000–present====
In 2000, [[George W. Bush]] won the [[2000 United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election]] by a margin of 271–266 in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].<ref name="archives2000"/> Of the 271 electoral votes for Bush, 25 were cast by electors from Florida.<ref name="archives1"/> The Florida results were contested and a recount was ordered by the court, with the results settled in a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decision, ''[[Bush v. Gore]]''.

Reapportionment following the 2010 United States census gave the state two more seats in the House of Representatives.<ref name="www.tampabay.com">Leary, Alex: [http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/article1141209.ece "Florida gains two U.S. House seats in Census"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224164152/http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/national/article1141209.ece |date=December 24, 2010 }}, ''St. Petersburg Times'', December 21, 2010</ref> The legislature's redistricting, announced in 2012, was quickly challenged in court, on the grounds that it had unfairly benefited Republican interests. In 2015, the Florida Supreme Court ruled on appeal that the congressional districts had to be redrawn because of the legislature's violation of the Fair District Amendments to the state constitution passed in 2010; it accepted a new map in early December 2015.

The political make-up of congressional and legislative districts has enabled Republicans to control the governorship and most statewide elective offices, and 17 of the state's 27 seats in the 2012 [[United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2012|House of Representatives]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Pear|first=Robert|title=Elections 2012, State Results|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/results/states/florida|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 15, 2013|archive-date=February 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220151058/https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2012/results/states/florida.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Florida has been listed as a [[swing state]] in presidential elections since 1952, voting for the losing candidate only twice in that period of time.<!--Nixon in 1960 and Bush in 1992.

In 2008, delegates of both the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008#GOP February 5 rule|Republican Florida primary election]] and [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008#Nullified primaries|Democratic Florida primary election]] were stripped of half of their votes when the conventions met in August due to violation of both parties' national rules.

In the 2010 elections, Republicans solidified their dominance statewide, by winning the governor's mansion, and maintaining firm majorities in both houses of the state legislature. They won four previously Democratic-held seats to create a 19–6 Republican majority delegation representing Florida in the federal House of Representatives.

In 2010, more than 63% of state voters approved the initiated Amendments{{spaces}}5 and{{spaces}}6 to the state constitution, to ensure more fairness in districting. These have become known as the Fair District Amendments. As a result of the [[2010 United States Census]], Florida gained two House of Representative seats in 2012.<ref name="www.tampabay.com" /> The legislature issued revised congressional districts in 2012, which were immediately challenged in court by supporters of the above amendments.

The court ruled in 2014, after lengthy testimony, that at least two districts had to be redrawn because of gerrymandering. After this was appealed, in July 2015 the Florida Supreme Court ruled that lawmakers had followed an illegal and unconstitutional process overly influenced by party operatives, and ruled that at least eight districts had to be redrawn. On December 2, 2015, a 5–2 majority of the Court accepted a new map of congressional districts, some of which was drawn by challengers. Their ruling affirmed the map previously approved by [[Leon County, Florida|Leon County]] Judge Terry Lewis, who had overseen the original trial. It particularly makes changes in South Florida. There are likely to be additional challenges to the map and districts.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article47576450.html Mary Ellen Klas, "Florida Supreme Court approves congressional map drawn by challengers"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314023536/http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/state-politics/article47576450.html |date=March 14, 2016 }}, ''Tampa Bay Times'', December 2, 2015, accessed December 11, 2016</ref>

According to [[The Sentencing Project]], the effect of Florida's felony disenfranchisement law is such that in 2014, "[m]ore than one in ten Floridians—and nearly one in four African-American Floridians—are [were] shut out of the polls because of felony convictions", although they had completed sentences and parole/probation requirements.<ref>Brent Staples, "Florida Leads the Pack—in Felon Disenfranchisement", ''[[The New York Times]]'', November 7, 2014, accessed March 23, 2016</ref>

The state switched back to the GOP in the [[2016 United States presidential election in Florida|2016 presidential election]], and again in [[2020 United States presidential election in Florida|2020]], when [[Donald Trump]] headed the party's ticket both times. 2020 marked the first time Florida sided with the eventual loser of the presidential election since [[1992 United States presidential election in Florida|1992]].

In the [[2018 United States elections|2018 elections]], the ratio of Republican to Democratic representation fell from 16:11 to 14:13. The [[2018 United States Senate election in Florida|U.S. Senate election]] between Democratic incumbent senator [[Bill Nelson]] and then governor [[Rick Scott]] was close, with 49.93% voting for the incumbent and 50.06% voting for the former governor.
