'''Wałbrzych''' ({{IPA|pl|ˈvawbʐɨx|lang|Pl-Wałbrzych.ogg}}; {{langx|de|Waldenburg}}; {{langx|szl|Wałbrzich}}; {{langx|sli|label=[[Silesian German|Lower Silesian]]|Walmbrig}} or ''Walmbrich''; {{langx|cs|Valbřich}} or {{lang|cs|Valdenburk}}) is a city located in the [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]], in southwestern [[Poland]], seat of [[Wałbrzych County]]. Wałbrzych lies approximately {{convert|70|km|mi}} southwest of the voivodeship capital [[Wrocław]] and about {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}} from the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] border. Wałbrzych has the status of municipality. Its administrative borders encompass an area of {{Convert|85|km2|abbr=on}} with 110,000 inhabitants,{{when|date=February 2023}} making it the second-largest city in the voivodeship and the 33rd largest in the country.

Wałbrzych was once a major [[coal mining]] and industrial center alongside most of [[Silesia]]. The city was left undamaged after [[World War II]] and possesses rich historical architecture; among the most recognizable landmarks is the [[Książ Castle]], the largest castle of [[Lower Silesia]] and the third-largest in Poland.

In 2015 Wałbrzych became widely known due to the search for an allegedly buried [[Nazi gold train]], which however was not found.

== Etymology ==
According to the city's official website, the earliest Polish name of the settlement was {{Lang|pl|Lasogród}} ('forest castle').<ref name="um.walbrzych.pl">{{cite web|url=http://www.um.walbrzych.pl/strony/nasze_miasto_poznaj_historia.htm|title=Portal Urzędu Miejskiego w Wałbrzychu|work=um.walbrzych.pl}}</ref>
The German name is also the exact translation of the original Polish  ‘forest castle’ {{Lang|de|Waldenburg}} (also  referred to the castle Nowy Dwór, translated into German as: {{Lang|de|Burg Neuhaus}}), whose ruins stand south of the city; the name came to be used for the entire settlement.<ref name="Weczerka-555">Weczerka, p.555.</ref> It first appeared in the 15th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.poradniajezykowa.us.edu.pl/baza_archiwum.php?POZYCJA=120&AKCJA=&TEMAT=Etymologia&NZP=&WYRAZ= |title=Witamy w PORADNI JĘZYKOWEJ |work=us.edu.pl}}</ref> The modern Polish name Wałbrzych comes from the German name {{Lang|de|Walbrich}}, a late medieval variation of the older names {{Lang|de|Wallenberg}} or {{Lang|de|Walmberg}}.<ref name=czopek55>Barbara Czopek, ''Adaptacje niemieckich nazw miejscowych w języku polskim'', 1995, p.55, {{ISBN|83-85579-33-8}}</ref>

Polish sources indicate the city's predecessor, Lasogród, was an early medieval [[Gord (archaeology)|Slavic settlement]]<ref>Słownik geograficzno-krajoznawczy Polski Maria Irena Mileska 1994 page 781 Wydawn. Nauk. PWN, 1994</ref> whose inhabitants engaged in hunting, honey gathering, and later agriculture.

According to 17th-century Polish historian Ephraim Naso, Wałbrzych was a small village by 1191.<ref>''Kronika wałbrzyska'' Wałbrzyskie Towarzystwo Kultury, [[Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe]] 1985 page 231</ref> This assertion was rejected by 19th-century German sources<ref>''Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie, Band 23'', page 261, Markgraf, Duncker & Humblot, 1886</ref>{{request quotation|date=September 2014}} and by German historian Hugo Weczerka,<ref>''Die Behauptung, die "Waldenburg" sei 1191 erbaut worden (Naso), ist nicht haltbar.''

He places the city near Nowy Dwór ({{langx|de|link=no|Neuhaus}}), built by [[Bolko I the Strict]] of the [[Piast dynasty|Silesian Piasts]].<ref name="Weczerka-555" /> The city website, however, cites the building of the castle as a separate event in 1290.<ref name="um.walbrzych.pl"/> A part of Nowy Dwór castle, a manor built in the 17th century, was destroyed in the 19th century.<ref>Weczerka, p.341.</ref> Nevertheless, the region became part of Poland after the establishment of the state under the [[Piast dynasty]] in the 10th century and during the [[Fragmentation of Poland|fragmentation of the realm]], it was part of various Polish-ruled duchies, the last of which was the Duchy of [[Świdnica]]<ref name=um>{{cite web|url=https://www.um.walbrzych.pl/pl/page/historia|title=Historia|website=Portal Urzędu Miejskiego w Wałbrzychu|access-date=7 March 2020|language=pl}}</ref> until 1392, later it was also part of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]] and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]].

The settlement was first mentioned as a town in 1426, but it did not receive the rights to hold markets or other privileges due to the competition of nearby towns and the insignificance of the local landlords. Subsequently, the city became the property of the Silesian knightly families, initially the [[Schaffgotsch]]es in 1372, later the Czettritzes, and from 1738, the [[Höchberg|Hochberg]] family, owners of [[Książ Castle]].

=== Modern era ===
[[File:Schloss Fuerstenstein Sammlung Duncker.jpg|thumb|left|19th-century view of the [[Książ]] Castle]]
[[Coal mining]] in the area was first mentioned in 1536. The settlement was transformed into an industrial centre at the turn of the 19th century, when coal mining and [[weaving]] flourished.

As a result of the [[First Silesian War]] the city was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1742, and subsequently became part of Germany in 1871. In 1843 the city obtained its first rail connection, which linked it with [[Breslau]] (now [[Wrocław]], Poland). In the early 20th century a glassworks and a large [[china (material)|china]] tableware manufacturing plant, which are still in operation today, were built. During [[World War I]], the Germans operated three forced labour camps for [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[World War I prisoners of war in Germany|prisoners of war]] in the city.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kujat|first=Janusz Adam|year=2000|title=Pieniądz zastępczy w obozach jenieckich na terenie rejencji wrocławskiej w czasie I i II wojny światowej|journal=Łambinowicki rocznik muzealny|location=Opole|language=pl|volume=23|page=13|issn=0137-5199}}</ref> In 1939 the city had about 65,000 inhabitants.

After [[World War II]], Waldenburg became again part of Poland under border changes demanded by the [[Soviet Union]] at the [[Potsdam Conference]] and was renamed to its historic Polish name<ref>Polski Kalendarz Katolicki dla Kochanych Wiarusów Prus Zachodnich page 77 http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=259791&from=&dirids=1&ver_id=&lp=2&QI=</ref><ref>Katalog Prowincyonalnej wystawy przemysłowej w Poznaniu 1895 page 71 Werbebeilage http://www.wbc.poznan.pl/dlibra/docmetadata?id=130018&from=&dirids=1&ver_id=&lp=7&QI=</ref> Wałbrzych. Many of the Germans living in the city [[Flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|fled or were expelled]] in accordance to the [[Potsdam Agreement]]. The town was repopulated by [[Polish people|Poles]] expelled from [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|former eastern Poland annexed by the Soviet Union]], particularly from [[Boryslav|Borysław]], [[Drohobycz]] and [[Ivano-Frankivsk|Stanisławów]], as well as Poles returning from [[France]] and [[Belgium]] and from [[Forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] in Germany.<ref name=um/> Wałbrzych was one of the few areas where a number of Germans<ref>Werner Besch, ''Dialektologie: Ein Handbuch zur Deutschen und allgemeinen Dialektforschung'', Walter de Gruyter, 1982, p.178, {{ISBN|3-11-005977-0}}</ref> were held back as they were deemed indispensable for the economy, e.g. coal mining.<ref name="wolff79">Stefan Wolff, ''[[iarchive:germanminorities0000unse|German Minorities in Europe: Ethnic Identity and Cultural Belonging]]'', Berghahn Books, 2000, p.79, {{ISBN|1-57181-504-X}}</ref> Also [[Greeks in Poland|Greeks]], refugees of the [[Greek Civil War]], settled in Wałbrzych in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Kubasiewicz|first=Izabela|editor-last1=Dworaczek|editor-first1=Kamil|editor-last2=Kamiński|editor-first2=Łukasz|year=2013|title=Letnia Szkoła Historii Najnowszej 2012.

After the [[Treaty of Zgorzelec]], remaining Germans were treated less harshly and an ethnic German society was established in 1957.<ref name=wolff79 /> The cultural activities however disappeared by the 1960s and the schools with German as the language of instruction gradually closed. The remaining German-speakers had little contact with the German spoken and written language and the local German-Silesian dialect became [[Endangered language|moribound]].<ref>{{cite journal|work=Sprachwissenschaft und Daf|doi=10.18778/2196-8403.2018.08|author=Katarzyna Dulat-Lewicz|title=Wie stirbt eine Sprache aus?

The city was relatively unscathed by the Second World War, and as a result of combining the nearby administrative districts with the town and the construction of new housing estates, Wałbrzych expanded geographically. From 1975 to 1998 it was the capital of [[Wałbrzych Voivodeship]]. At the beginning of the 1990s, because of new social and economic conditions, a decision was made to close down the town's coal mines. In 1995, a Museum of Industry and Technology was [[Old Mine in Wałbrzych|set up on the facilities of the oldest coal mine]] in the area, KWK THOREZ. The 2005 the film ''[[The Collector (2005 film)|The Collector]]'' was filmed in and around Wałbrzych.
