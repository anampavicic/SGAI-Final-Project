In 1974, the [[Government of Tanzania|Tanzanian government]] announced that [[Tanzania]]'s federal capital would be moved from [[Dar es Salaam]] to Dodoma for social and economic reasons and to centralise the capital within the country. It became the official capital in 1996.

Much of Dodoma's initial design did not come to fruition until the 21st century. In May 2023, the national government under President [[Samia Suluhu]] unveiled the new State House in Dodoma in a historic event stamping the relocation of government duties to the city. As a result, [[Dar es Salaam]] remained the commercial and maritime capital of Tanzania with Dodoma retaining the state house [[Ikulu]], and a large number of government functions.

==Geography==
Located in the centre of the country, the town is {{convert|453|km|mi|0}} west of the former capital at [[Dar es Salaam]] and {{convert|441|km|mi|0}} south of [[Arusha]], the headquarters of the [[East African Community]]. It is {{convert|259|km|abbr=off}} north of Iringa through Mtera. It is also {{convert|260|km|abbr=off}} west of Morogoro. It covers an area of {{convert|2669|km2|sqmi|0}} of which {{convert|625|km2|sqmi|0}} is urbanized.

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Gezicht over Dodoma TMnr 60031828.jpg|thumb|Dodoma in 1912]]

===20th century===
Originally a small market town known as Idodomya, the modern Dodoma was founded in 1907 by [[German Africa|German colonists]] during construction of the [[Central Line (Tanzania)|Tanzanian central railway]]. The layout followed the typical colonial planning of the time with a European quarter segregated from a native village.<ref name=":0">{{cite journal |last1=Siebolds |first1=Peter |last2=Steinberg |first2=Florian |title=Dodoma — A future African Brasilia? |journal=Habitat International |volume=5 |issue=5–6 |pages=681–690 |doi=10.1016/0197-3975(80)90008-9 |year=1980}}</ref>

In 1967, following independence, the government invited Canadian firm Project Planning Associates Ltd to draw up a master plan to help control and organise the then capital of the country, [[Dar es Salaam]], which was undergoing rapid urbanisation and population growth. The plan was cancelled in 1972, in part due to its failure to adequately address the historical and social problems associated with the city.<ref name=":0" />

In 1974, after a nationwide party referendum, the Tanzanian government announced that the capital would be moved from Dar es Salaam to a more central location to create significant social and economic improvements for the central region and to centralise the capital within the country.<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Dodoma Dodoma], britannica.com, USA, accessed on June 24, 2019</ref> The cost was estimated at £186 million and envisaged to take 10 years. The site, the Dodoma region, had been looked at as a potential new capital as early as 1915 by the then colonial power [[Germany]], in 1932 by the British as a [[League of Nations mandate]] and again in the post-independence [[National Assembly (Tanzania)|National Assembly]] in 1961 and 1966.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal |last=Beeckmans |first=Luce |title=The Architecture of Nation-building in Africa as a Development Aid Project: Designing the capital cities of Kinshasa (Congo) and Dodoma (Tanzania) in the post-independence years |journal=Progress in Planning |volume=122 |pages=1–28 |doi=10.1016/j.progress.2017.02.001 |year=2018}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite journal |last=Hayuma |first=A.M. |title=Dodoma: The planning and building of the new capital city of Tanzania |journal=Habitat International |volume=5 |issue=5–6 |pages=653–680 |doi=10.1016/0197-3975(80)90007-7 |year=1980}}</ref>

With an already-established town at a major crossroads, the Dodoma region had an agreeable climate, room for development<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.etsav.upc.es/personals/iphs2004/pdf/148_p.pdf |author=Aloysius C. Mosha |title=The planning of the new capital of Tanzania: Dodoma, an unfulfilled dream |access-date=2013-03-13 |publisher=University of Botswana}}</ref> and was located in the geographic centre of the nation. Its location in a rural environment was seen as the [[ujamaa]] heartland and therefore appropriate for a ujamaa capital that could see and learn from neighbouring villages and maintain a close relationship to the land.<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3">{{cite book |title=Architecture, power, and national identity |last=Vale |first=Lawrence J |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |isbn=9780415955140 |location=London |pages=146–193}}</ref>

A new capital was seen as a more economically viable alternative than attempting to reorganise and restructure [[Dar es Salaam]] and was idealised as a way of diverting development away from continued concentration in a single coastal city that was seen as anathema to the government's goal of socialist unity and development.<ref name=":2" /> Objectives for the new capital included: that the city become a symbol of Tanzania's social and cultural values and aspirations; that the capital city function be supplemented by industrial-commercial development; and that the mistakes and features of colonial planning and modern big cities, such as excessive population densities, pollution and traffic congestion, be avoided.<ref name=":0" />

The Capital Development Authority (CDA) invited three international firms to submit proposals for the best location and preparation of a master plan: Project Planning Associates Ltd., of [[Canada]]; [[Constantinos Apostolou Doxiadis|Doxiadis Associates]] International, of [[Greece]] (who had worked on [[Pakistan]]'s new capital of [[Islamabad]]); and Engineering Consulting Firms Association, of [[Japan]]. A fourth firm from Germany submitted a proposal without invitation.<ref name=":2" />

The winner, decided by the CDA together with independent American consultants, was Project Planning Associates, the same Canadian consultants whose plan for [[Dar es Salaam]] was seen as inadequate and not responsive enough to the local conditions and needs for Tanzania's largest city.<ref name=":2" /> Their plan envisaged a city of 400,000 persons by 2000 and 1.3 million by 2020.<ref name=":3" />

The official capital since 1996, Dodoma was envisaged as the first non-monumental capital city<ref name=":3" /> as opposed to the monumentality and hierarchy of other planned capital cities such as [[Abuja]], [[Yamoussoukro]], [[Brasília]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] It rejected geometrical forms such as [[Grid plan|grid iron]] and radial plans as inappropriate as the urban form was intended to undulate and curve with the existing topography and not in conflict with it so as to retain its rural [[ujamaa]] feel. As befitted Tanzania's development at the time, the car was seen as secondary in importance to public transports such as buses which were then utilised by much of the population.<ref name=":3" />

In 1974, Dodoma had a population of 40,000 and was chosen as the site of the new capital as opposed to nearby Hombolo or Ihumwa. The existing population size was not seen as an impediment while existing infrastructure would reduce construction costs.<ref name=":2" />

The city, designed over {{convert|2,500|acres|abbr=off}}, was meant to be "the chief village in a nation of villages", built at a human scale meant to be experienced on foot.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Friedman |first=Andrew |date=2012-05-01 |title=The Global Postcolonial Moment and the American New Town India, Reston, Dodoma |url=http://juh.sagepub.com/content/38/3/553 |journal=Journal of Urban History |language=en |volume=38 |issue=3 |pages=553–576 |doi=10.1177/0096144211428765 |s2cid=146425224 |issn=0096-1442}}</ref> Its basic principles follow the [[Garden city movement|garden city]] model of a town set amongst a garden with green belts separating segregated zones for residents and industry.

As part of the move of the government, a capitol complex was envisaged and designs by international teams offered competing visions and versions of the siting and layout of a capitol complex. These competing proposals, some paid for by foreign governments as a form of aid and others by the firms involved, were presented as early as 1978.

===21st century===
However, it was not until 2006 that the [[Government of China|Chinese government]] delivered a finished parliament building in Dodoma. The final location of the parliament was not in its original intended location in the master plan, with that location now being developed as a site for a [[University of Dodoma|university]].<ref name=":1" />

As much of the initial design never came to fruition over the past 40 years, government offices and embassies have resisted moving offices to Dodoma. As a result, many government offices remain in [[Dar es Salaam]], which remains the commercial and the [[de facto]] capital of Tanzania.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Callaci |first=Emily |date=2016-02-01 |title='Chief village in a nation of villages': history, race and authority in Tanzania's Dodoma plan |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/urban-history/article/chief-village-in-a-nation-of-villages-history-race-and-authority-in-tanzanias-dodoma-plan/869EEBF9AA750AD62914195FB451DB3E |journal=Urban History |volume=43 |issue=1 |pages=96–116 |doi=10.1017/S0963926814000753 |s2cid=146410916 |issn=0963-9268}}</ref><ref name=":1" />

Dodoma was envisaged as a nation-building project to cement a newly post-colonial independence identity and direction in Tanzania, and is similar to projects in [[Nigeria]] ([[Abuja]]), [[Côte d'Ivoire]] ([[Yamoussoukro]]), [[Botswana]] ([[Gaborone]]), [[Malawi]] ([[Lilongwe]]) and [[Mauritania]] ([[Nouakchott]]).<ref name=":1" />

==Demographics==
[[File:Central Dodoma.JPG|thumb|Central Dodoma in March 2015]]
Out of the total population, 199,487 people (48.5 percent) are male while 211,469 people (51.5 percent) are female. The average household size is 4.4 people.<ref name="2022 census" /> The [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] reports that 19.2% of the population are [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/ddodo.html|title=Dodoma (Archdiocese) [Catholic-Hierarchy]|first=David M.|last=Cheney|access-date=22 August 2016}}</ref> Dodoma is populated by different ethnic groups because it is a government administrative centre, although the indigenous ethnic groups are the [[Gogo people|Gogo]], [[Rangi people|Rangi]], and [[Sandawe people|Sandawe]]. There are also small [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian]] minorities.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The population count as of 2022 was recorded as 3,085,625 in Dodoma region of 41,311&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, while Dodoma city increased from 410,956 in 2012 to 765,179 in 2022, covering 2,607&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, or annual rate of 6.4% in ten years.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://citypopulation.de/en/tanzania/admin/ | title=Tanzania: Administrative Division (Regions and Districts) – Population Statistics, Charts and Map }}</ref>

==Education==
===Universities===
[[File:University of Dodoma.jpg|thumb|The [[University of Dodoma]]]]
There are several universities in Dodoma, which include the [[Open University of Tanzania]], which has campuses in several cities in Tanzania, [[St Johns University of Tanzania]], owned by the Anglican Church of Tanzania, and [[University of Dodoma]], with about 35,000 students. Both universities opened in 2007. In addition there is the  Mipango University and the CBE.

The Anglican Church runs the only international school in Dodoma, Canon Andrea Mwaka School ("CAMS"). CAMS, established in 1950, provides education to children from Nursery to Form 4. The education is based on the English National curriculum and the school offers students the opportunity to take IGCSE examinations. An estimated 280 students are taught at the school. {{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}

===Airport===
[[File:Dodoma airport.jpg|thumb|A stationary aircraft at [[Dodoma Airport]]]]
[[File:University of Dodoma,road.jpg|thumb|The road to the [[University of Dodoma]]]]
North of the city centre, [[Dodoma Airport]] is managed by the [[Tanzania Civil Aviation Authority]]. Flights are currently limited to small aircraft operated commercially by [[Precision Air]], [[Air Tanzania]], [[Auric Air]], and [[Flightlink]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.auricair.com |title=Auric Air |date=March 30, 2012 |access-date=March 30, 2012 |work=Auric Air Services Ltd}}</ref> However, in December 2019, a US$272M loan plan was announced to build a new, far bigger airport outside the city with increased runway length and weight-bearing capacity.<ref>[https://www.ippmedia.com/en/node/72938 Funds for new airport]</ref>

===Railway===
The city is served by Dodoma Railway Station, located near Kikuyu Avenue, through which runs the [[Central Line (Tanzania)|Central Railway Line]], which connects Dodoma over a distance of {{convert|465|km|mi}} with [[Dar es Salaam]] in the east. In 2019, Tanzania Railways commissioned a study into a Dodoma commuter rail network.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/news/infrastructure/single-view/view/dodoma-commuter-rail-study-commissioned.html |title=Dodoma commuter rail study commissioned |website=Railway Gazette |date=11 June 2019 |access-date=11 June 2019}}</ref>

===Public transport===
A [[daladala]] station serves Dodoma on B129 south west of Dodoma.
