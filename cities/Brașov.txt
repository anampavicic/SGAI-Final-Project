According to the [[2021 Romanian census|2021 census]], with 237,589 inhabitants, Brașov is the [[Cities in Romania|6th most populous city]] in Romania.<ref name="RPL2021"/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-26058967-harta-interactiva-populatia-romaniei-fiecare-localitate-din-tara-recensamantul-2021-2011-cele-mai-mari-creseri-cele-mai-drastice-scaderi.htm|title=Populația României în fiecare localitate din țară - Recensământul 2021 vs. 2011|publisher=hotnews.ro|language=ro|date=2 February 2023}}</ref> The [[Brașov metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] was home to 371,802 residents.<ref name="RPL2021"/>

Brașov is located in the central part of the country, about {{convert|166|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Bucharest]] and {{convert|380|km|0|abbr=on}} from the [[Black Sea]]. It is surrounded by the [[Southern Carpathians]] and is part of the historical region of [[Transylvania]].

Historically, the city was the centre of the [[Burzenland]] ({{langx|ro|Țara Bârsei}}), once dominated by the [[Transylvanian Saxons]] ({{langx|de|Siebenbürger Sachsen}}), and a significant commercial hub on the trade roads between [[Austria]] (then [[Archduchy of Austria]], within the [[Habsburg monarchy]], and subsequently [[Austrian Empire]]) and [[Turkey]] (then [[Ottoman Empire]]). It is also where the [[Deșteaptă-te, române!|national anthem of Romania]] was first sung.

==Names==
===Brassovia, Brassó, Brașov, etc.===
According to Dragoș Moldovanu, the name of Brașov came from the name of local river named Bârsa (also pronounced as "Bărsa") that was adopted by Slavs and transformed to Barsa, and later to Barsov, finally to Brasov.<ref>Dragoș Moldovanu, Toponimie de origine romană în Transilvania și în sud-vestul Moldovei, Anuarul de lingvistică și istorie literară, XLIX-L, 2009–2010, Bucuresti, p 59</ref> According to Pál Binder, the current Romanian and the Hungarian name {{lang|hu|Brassó}} ({{IPA-hu|ˈbrɒʃʃoː|}}) are derived from the [[Pecheneg language|Turkic]] word ''barasu'', meaning "white water" with a Slavic suffix ''-ov''.<ref>Alexandru Madgearu, [http://arheologie.ulbsibiu.ro/publicatii/bibliotheca/relatii%20interetnice%20in%20transilvania/6%20madgearu/articol1.htm "Români și pecenegi în sudul Transilvaniei"] {{webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20100108011943/http://arheologie.ulbsibiu.ro/publicatii/bibliotheca/relatii%20interetnice%20in%20transilvania/6%20madgearu/articol1.htm|date=2010-01-08}}, Editura Economică, 2005, {{ISBN|973-709-158-2}}</ref> Other linguists proposed various etymologies including an Old Slavic anthroponym Brasa.<ref>Drăganu, Nicolae "Români in veacurile IX—XIV pe baza toponimiei şi a onomasticei" (The Romanians in the 9th - 14th Centuries According to Toponymy and Onomastics), Imprimeria Națională, 1933, București, p.560</ref><ref>Austerlitz, Robert ""Brasov-Brasso'-Kronstadt-Berries and Bushes", in Xenia Slavica; Papers Presented to Gojko Ruzicic on the Occasion of his Seventy-Fifth Birthday, 2 February 1969, [[Rado Lencek]] and [[Boris Unbegaun|Boris O. Unbegaun]], eds. (The Hague: Mouton, 1957), p.19</ref> The first attested mention of this name is ''Terra Saxonum de Barasu'' ("[[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] Land of Baras") in a 1252 document issued by [[Béla IV of Hungary]].<ref name="Orbán Balázs 1868" /> According to some historians, ''Corona'' was name of the city-fortress while ''Brassó'' was referring to the [[Brassó County|county]], while others consider both names may refer to the city and the county as well.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}
===Corona, Kronstadt===
According to Balázs Orbán, the name ''Corona''&nbsp;– a Latin word meaning "crown"&nbsp;– is first mentioned in the Catalogus Ninivensis in 1235 AD, stating a monastic quarter existed in the territory of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cumania]] (''In Hungaria assignata est paternitas Dyocesis Cumanie: Corona'').<ref name="Orbán Balázs 1868">{{cite book |author=Orbán Balázs |author-link=Balázs Orbán |title=A Székelyföld leírása VI |year=1868 |location=Pest|title-link=A Székelyföld leírása }}</ref> Pál Binder supposed it is a reference to the St. Catherine's Monastery. Others suggest the name derives from the old [[coat of arms]] of the city, as it is symbolized by the German name ''Kronstadt'' meaning "Crown City". The two names of the city, ''Kronstadt'' and ''Corona'', were used simultaneously in the [[Middle Ages]], along with the [[Medieval Latin]] ''Brassovia''.

===Stephanopolis, Orașul Stalin===
[[File:1950 - Decretul de schimbare a numelui orasului Brasov in Orasul Stalin.jpg|thumb|right|1950 decree by C. I. Parhon (co-signed by M. F. Ionescu) changing the name of Brașov to Stalin City]]
Another historical name used for Brașov is ''Stephanopolis'',<ref>J. G. Th. Graesse: ''[[Orbis Latinus]]'', G. Schönfeld, Dresden 1861, {{URN|nbn:de:s2w-3093}} ([http://www.columbia.edu/acis/ets/Graesse/contents.html html, with alphabetical search index]<!-- [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_xfY_AAAAIAAJ pdf], s. nichtkommerzielle URN -->).</ref> from "Stephanos", crown, and "polis", city.

On 22 August 1950, Brașov was [[List of places in Romania whose names were changed|renamed]] ''Orașul Stalin'' (''lit.'' [[List of places named after Joseph Stalin|Stalin City]]) after [[Joseph Stalin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveltoromania.com/destinations/transylvania/brasov|title=Brasov – Travel To Romania|website=www.traveltoromania.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010045359/http://www.traveltoromania.com/destinations/transylvania/brasov|archive-date=2007-10-10|access-date=2008-01-04}}</ref> [[Constantin Ion Parhon]], the nominal Head of State at the time, decreed the city be renamed "in honour of the great genius of working humanity, the leader of the Soviet people, the liberator and beloved friend of our people, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin". The city’s name reverted to Brașov in 1960.

The oldest traces of human activity and settlements in Brașov date back to the [[Neolithic]] age (about 9500 BCE). Archaeologists working from the last half of the 19th century discovered continuous traces of human settlements in areas situated in Brașov: Valea Cetății, Pietrele lui Solomon, Șprenghi, Tâmpa, Dealul Melcilor, and Noua. The first three locations show traces of [[Dacians|Dacian]] citadels; Șprenghi Hill housed a [[Roman Dacia|Roman]]-style construction. The last two locations had their names applied to [[Bronze Age]] cultures — Schneckenberg ("Hill of the Snails"; Early Bronze Age){{sfn| Coles| Harding | 1979|p=140}} and ''[[Noua culture|Noua]]'' ("The New"; Late Bronze Age).{{sfn| Coles| Harding | 1979|p=410}}

[[Transylvanian Saxons]] played a decisive role in Brașov's development and were invited by [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] kings to develop towns, build mines, and cultivate the land of [[Transylvania]] at different stages between 1141 and 1300. The settlers came primarily from the [[Rhineland]], [[Flanders]], and the [[Moselle]] region, with others from [[Thuringia]], [[Bavaria]], [[Wallonia]], and even France.

In 1211, by order of King [[Andrew II of Hungary]], the [[Teutonic Knights]] fortified the [[Burzenland]] to defend the border of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]]. On the site of the village of Brașov, the Teutonic Knights built Kronstadt – 'the City of the Crown'.<ref>Mediaeval studies, Volumes 17-18, Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies, 1955, Toronto, Canada, An annual journal of scholarship, History, {{ISSN|0076-5872}}</ref> Although the crusaders were evicted by 1225, the colonists they brought in long ago remained, along with local population in three distinct settlements they founded on the site of Brașov:
*''Corona'', around the Black Church (Biserica Neagră);
*''Martinsberg'', west of Cetățuia Hill;
*''Bartholomä'', on the eastern side of Sprenghi Hill.
[[File:Brasov 1689.jpg|thumb|left|Illustration of the walled city prior to the 1689 fire]]
Germans living in Brașov were mainly involved in trade and crafts. The location of the city at the intersection of trade routes linking the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Western Europe]], together with certain tax exemptions, allowed Saxon merchants to obtain considerable wealth and exert a strong political influence. They contributed a great deal to the architectural flavour of the city. Fortifications around the city were erected and continually expanded, with several towers maintained by different craftsmen's guilds, according to the medieval custom. Part of the fortification ensemble was recently restored using [[UNESCO]] funds, and other projects are ongoing. At least two entrances to the city, ''Poarta Ecaterinei'' (or ''Katharinentor'') and ''Poarta Șchei'' (or ''Waisenhausgässertor''), are still in existence. The city centre is marked by the mayor's former office building ([[:ro:Casa Sfatului din Brașov|Casa Sfatului]]) and the surrounding square (''piața''), which includes one of the oldest buildings in Brașov, the Hirscher Haus. Nearby is the "Black Church" (''[[Biserica Neagră]]''), which some claim to be the largest [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] church in [[Southeastern Europe]].

In 1689, [[1689 Brașov fire|a great fire]] destroyed the walled city almost entirely, and its rebuilding lasted several decades.

Besides the German (Saxon) population living in the walled city and in the northern suburbs, Brașov had also a significant Romanian and Bulgarian population (living in the [[Șcheii Brașovului|Șchei]] district), and also some Hungarian population (living in the Blumăna district). The cultural and religious importance of the Romanian church and school in Șchei is underlined by the generous donations received from more than thirty [[hospodar]]s of Moldavia and Wallachia, as well as that from [[Elizabeth of Russia]]. In the 17th and 19th centuries, the Romanians in Șchei campaigned for national, political, and cultural rights, and were supported in their efforts by Romanians from all other provinces, as well as by the local Greek merchant community. In 1838, they established the first Romanian language newspaper ''[[Gazeta Transilvaniei]]'' and the first Romanian institutions of higher education: ''Școlile Centrale Greco-Ortodoxe'' ("The Greek-Orthodox Central Schools", today named after [[Andrei Șaguna]]). The [[Holy Roman Emperor]] and sovereign of Transylvania [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] awarded Romanians citizenship rights for a brief period during the latter decades of the 18th century.

In 1850, the town had 21,782 inhabitants: 8,874 (40.7%) Germans, 8,727 (40%) Romanians, 2,939 (13.4%) Hungarians.<ref name="varga.adatbank.transindex.ro">{{cite web|url=http://varga.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=3&action=etnik&id=5861|title=Erdély etnikai és felekezeti statisztikája|website=varga.adatbank.transindex.ro|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219010951/http://varga.adatbank.transindex.ro/?pg=3&action=etnik&id=5861|archive-date=2007-12-19|access-date=2007-11-26}}</ref> In 1910 there were 41,056 inhabitants: 17,831 (43.4%) Hungarians, 11,786 (28.7%) Romanians, 10,841 (26.4%) Germans.<ref name="varga.adatbank.transindex.ro"/>

On 29 August 1916, during the [[First World War]], the [[Romanian Army]] occupied Brașov. Romanian troops entered the city at around five o'clock p.m. and paraded towards the city square. Romanian rule over the city lasted until early October, when the area was retaken by the [[Central Powers]] in the [[Battle of Brassó (1916)|Battle of Brassó]] (7-9 October 1916).<ref>Michael B. Barrett, Indiana University Press, 2013, ''Prelude to Blitzkrieg: The 1916 Austro-German Campaign in Romania'', pp. 26 and 122</ref> The Romanian mayor installed during the brief Romanian occupation was Gheorghe Baiulescu. His term lasted from 29 August, when the city was occupied by the Romanian Army, until 8 October – the height of the Battle of Brașov. On 9 October, at the end of the battle, the previous mayor Karl Ernst Schnell was reinstated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brasovcity.ro/documente/municipiu/primarii-brasovului.pdf |title=PRIMARII BRAȘOVULUI (in Romanian), p. 4 |access-date=2019-01-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170630062124/http://brasovcity.ro/documente/municipiu/primarii-brasovului.pdf |archive-date=2017-06-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Following the collapse of Austria-Hungary, the 1 December 1918 [[Union of Transylvania with Romania|Proclamation of the Union]] of [[Alba Iulia]], adopted by deputies of the Romanians from Transylvania, Banat, Crișana and Maramureș during the [[Great National Assembly of Alba Iulia]] declared the union of Transylvania into the Romanian state. Brașov was permanently occupied by Romanian forces on 7 December, as Hungarians gradually withdrew northwards. The King and some Transylvanians suggested that - because of Brașov's central geographical location in the new Romania - it should be considered as the new national capital. Though this did not happen - the inter-war period was a time of flourishing economy and cultural life in general, including the Saxons in Brașov. However, at the end of World War II many ethnic Germans were forcibly deported to the [[Soviet Union]]. A majority of them emigrated to [[West Germany]] after [[Communist Romania|Romania had become a communist country]].
[[File:RoBrasovCentruCivic.jpg|thumb|The Civic Centre (Centrul Civic), a neighbourhood built in the communist period]]
The first Jewish community in Brașov was established in 1828, joining the [[Neolog Judaism|Neolog]] association in 1868. [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] founded their religious organization in 1877. The Neolog synagogue, seating 800, was built between 1899 and 1905. During the [[interwar period]], the communities had separate institutions, but opened a jointly managed school in 1940. Zionist organizations appeared already in 1920. By 1930, Jews numbered 2594 individuals, or 4% of the total population. In autumn 1940, during the [[National Legionary State]], the antisemitic [[Iron Guard]] nationalized all Jewish institutions and seized most shops owned by Jews. In 1941, Jews were drafted for service in forced labour battalions. Those from throughout southern Transylvania were concentrated in Brașov; a further 200 refugees came from [[Ploiești]]. In August 1942, 850 Jews between the ages of 18 and 50 were drafted into labour battalions and ordered to work in Brașov, while others were sent to [[Predeal]] and [[Bran, Brașov|Bran]]. In spring 1943, 250 youths were sent to [[Suraia]] camp to build fortifications. By August 1944, the labour battalions were reduced to 250-300 while most of the Jews managed to obtain their freedom. In 1945–1946, the Jewish population increased to 3500.<ref>Shmuel Spector, Geoffrey Wigoder (eds.), ''The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust: A-J'', p. 182.

Like many other cities in Transylvania, Brașov is also home to a significant [[Hungarian minority in Romania|ethnic Hungarian minority]].

During the communist period, industrial development was vastly accelerated. Under [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]'s rule, the city was the site of the [[1987 Brașov strike]]. This was brutally repressed by the authorities and resulted in numerous workers being imprisoned.

== Economy ==

[[File:UTB - IAR-22 tractor 1.jpg|thumb|First Romanian-made tractor, the IAR 22, on display in front of the [https://coresibrasov.ro/ Coresi Shopping Resort]]]

Industrial development in Brașov started in the inter-war period, with one of the largest factories being the aeroplane manufacturing plant ([[Industria Aeronautică Română|IAR]] Brașov), which produced the first Romanian fighter planes used during World War II. After signing the armistice with [[USSR]] on September 12, 1944, the factory started repairing trucks, and in October 1945 it began manufacturing agricultural tractors. IAR 22 was the first Romanian-made wheeled tractor. In 1948 the company was renamed Uzina Tractorul Brașov known internationally as Universal Tractor Brașov.
A big part of the factory was demolished during 2013 and 2014 giving way to buildings, shopping mall and recreation parks.  Aircraft manufacturing resumed in 1968 at first under the name ICA and then under its old name of [[Industria Aeronautică Română|IAR]] at a new location in nearby [[Ghimbav]].

Industrialization was accelerated in the Communist era, with special emphasis being placed on [[heavy industry]], attracting many workers from other parts of the country. Heavy industry is still abundant, including [[Roman (vehicle manufacturer)|Roman]], which manufactures [[MAN SE|MAN AG]] trucks as well as native-designed trucks and coaches. Although the industrial base has been in decline in recent years, Brașov is still a site for manufacturing hydraulic transmissions, auto parts, ball-bearings, construction materials, hand tools, furniture, textiles and shoe-wear. There is also a large brewery. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The Brașov local transport network has 44 urban bus and trolleybus lines and 19 metropolitan bus lines. There are also regular bus lines serving [[Poiana Brașov]], a nearby winter resort and part of the city of Brașov, and the Brașov-Ghimbav International Airport. All are operated by [[Public transportation in Brașov|RAT Brașov]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=S.C. RATBV S.A. Brasov - operatorul de transport public din Brasov|url=https://www.ratbv.ro/|access-date=2020-08-21|website=www.ratbv.ro}}</ref> Because of its central location, the [[Brașov railway station]] is one of the busiest stations in Romania with trains to/from most destinations in the country served by rail.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

The [[Brașov-Ghimbav International Airport]] is an international airport located in nearby [[Ghimbav]], right by the future [[A3 (Romania)|A3 motorway]]. It is the first airport to be developed in post-communist Romania, and the 17th [[List of the busiest airports in Romania|commercial airport]] in the country. The contract for the construction of the main terminal building, with a total area of 11,780 m<sup>2</sup> (126,799 sq ft), was awarded to the Romanian contractor Bog'Art Bucharest and was signed on 21 August 2019. Construction works for the passenger terminal started on 17 March 2020 and the first commercial flight took place on June 15, 2023.

[[Căile Ferate Române|CFR]] announced a feasibility study for the construction of a rail line (8 km) which would connect the airport to the [[Brașov railway station]].

== Tourism ==
[[File:RO BV Piata Sfatului on 21 March 2020.jpg|alt=|thumb|The city center ([[Brașov Council Square (Piața Sfatului)|Piața Sfatului]])]]
With its central location, Brașov is a suitable location from which to explore Romania, and the distances to several tourist destinations (including the [[Black Sea]] resorts, the monasteries in northern Moldavia, and the wooden churches of [[Maramureș region|Maramureș]]) are similar. It is also the largest city in a mountain resorts area. The old city is very well preserved and is best seen by taking the cable-car to the top of Tâmpa Mountain.
[[File:The Black church and the Tampa mountain.jpg|thumb|One of the statues of [[Biserica Neagră]] and the BRAȘOV sign on the [[Tâmpa, Brașov|Tâmpa Mountain]] ]]
Temperatures from May to September fluctuate around {{convert|23|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Brașov benefits from a winter tourism season centred on [[winter sports]] and other activities. [[Poiana Brașov]] is the most popular Romanian [[ski resort]] and an important tourist centre preferred by many tourists from other European states.

The city ranks on the second place in terms of tourism arrivals countrywide, after the capital [[Bucharest]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.brasov.net/brasovul-pe-locul-doi-dupa-bucuresti-la-numarul-de-turisti-sinaia-si-predeal-statiunile-preferate-pentru-vacantele-la-munte/ | title=Braşovul, pe locul doi după Bucureşti, la numărul de turişti.

The city has a long tradition in sports, the first sport associations being established at the end of the 19th century (Target shooting Association, Gymnastics School). The Transylvanian Sports Museum is among the oldest in the country and presents the evolution of consecrated sports in the city. During the communist period, [[universiade]]s and [[Daciad]]s were held, where local sportsmen were obliged to participate. Nowadays, the infrastructure of the city allows other sports to be practiced, such as football, rugby, tennis, cycling, handball, gliding, skiing, skating, mountain climbing, paintball, bowling, swimming, target shooting, basketball, martial arts, equestrian, volleyball or gymnastics. Annually, at "Olimpia" sports ground, the "Brașov Challenge Cup" tennis competition is held.

[[Colțea Brașov]] was the football champion in 1928, managing a second place in 1927, in its only 10 years of existence (1921–1931). It was succeeded by [[Brașovia Brașov]].

Between 17 and 22 February 2013, the city hosted the [[2013 European Youth Winter Olympic Festival]].

{{As of|2012}}, Brașov is hosting two trail semi-marathons: the Semimaraton Intersport Brașov (held in April) and the Brașov International Marathon (held in April or May).
