== History ==
{{See also|Conflict mineral|Sierra Leone Civil War}} 
In 1995 the government of Sierra Leone signed an agreement with the South African company Branch Energy Limited, a subsidiary of [[Executive Outcomes]] (EO), a business that supplied mercenaries to governments across Africa. The agreement, negotiated under the [[Mines and Minerals Act (Sierra Leone)|Mines and Minerals Act]] of 1994, was scheduled to last 25 years. Under it Sierra Leone's military government gave the concession to operate the Koidu diamond mine to the firm in payment for helping to suppress the [[Revolutionary United Front]] rebels in the area during the country's civil war.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/africa/2016/04/04/Panama-Papers-Flaws-in-Sierra-Leone’s-diamond-trade |title=Panama Papers: Flaws in Sierra Leone's diamond trade |publisher=Times Media Group|work=Times Live|author1=Khadija Sharife|author2=Silas Gbandia|date=April 4, 2016}}</ref> They had been using the diamonds to buy weapons and ammunition from Guinea, Liberia, and the Sierra Leone army.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abdullah|first=Ibrahim|year=2004|title=Between Democracy and Terror: The Sierra Leone Civil War|location=Dakar|publisher=Council for the Development of Social Science Research in Africa}}</ref> The government of Sierra Leone retained a 60% ownership stake in the Koidu mine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pubs/parameters/Articles/99summer/adams.htm|title=The New Mercenaries and the Privatization of Conflict|work=Parameters Summer 1999|pages=103–16|author=Thomas K.

The [[Panama Papers]], leaked from the Panamanian law firm [[Mossack Fonseca]], showed that the family foundation of Beny Steinmetz family paid $1.2 million for half of the mining license issued by the national government for the Koidu mine. In 2003 the government transferred rights, duties, and responsibilities from Branch Energy to [[Koidu Holdings]], a company owned by Octea of the BSGR Resources group, for $28 million.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.jckonline.com/2016/01/21/beny-steinmetz-invest-sierra-leone-diamond-mine|title=Beny Steinmetz to invest in Sierra Leone diamond mine|publisher=JCK Magazine|date=April 8, 2004}}</ref> In 2015, the city filed suit against Octea, claiming that the company owed $684,000 in unpaid property taxes. In April 2016, Justice Bintu Alhadi of the High Court of Sierra Leone ruled that Octea and Koidu Limited were separate entities and that Octea technically did not own the mine, so had no duty to pay its property tax.<ref name=PP2 />
