It is approximately 125&nbsp;km from the state capital of Patna. [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]] is the widely spoken language in Buxar.

== Typonym ==
According to local traditions, the name ''Buxar'' is derived from a lake in the town named ''Aghsar'' (effacer of Sin), which in course of time became ''Baghsar'' and took the present form that is Buxar. Another vedic legend states that, a sage or rishi named Besira transformed himself to take the look of a Tiger to frighten [[Durvasa]] rishi, and doomed by him to retain the form of Tiger forever. In order to restore his Human's form, Bedsira  bathed in the holy pond of Aghsar and worshipped Gaurishankar. To commemorate this event the spot was called ''Vyaghrasar'' and later became ''Baghsar'' (The Tiger's pond).<ref name="ReferenceA">{{Cite book|title=Bihar And Orissa Gazetteers Shahabad|isbn=8172681224|pages=163|last1=O'Malley |first1=L.
