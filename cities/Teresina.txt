{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2023}}
[[File:Brasil Hoje n. 95 (1975) - Reportagem da Agência Nacional sobre o turismo em Teresina, Piauí.webm|left|thumb|Teresina, 1975. [[Brazilian National Archives|National Archives of Brazil.]]]]

Teresina was founded on August 16, 1852, under the name of Vila Nova do Poty (because its origin is linked to the Poti river) as the capital of the state of Piauí. It was the first planned city in the Brazil and the only northeast capital located out of the coast. Until 1852, Oeiras was the capital of the Piauí Captaincy. However, due to difficulties in communication and trade, the capital was transferred to an area next to the Parnaíba River, to the other cities and to the sea coast. Colonization of the area where Teresina is now located dates back to the 18th century. The chosen place was a small community of fishermen, in 1760, nearby Poty and Panaíba rivers, which grew into a village called "Vila do Poty", but, due to the inundation of the Parnaíba River riverbanks, the city had to be built in a higher position.

In the 19th century, it was initially called '''Vila Nova do Poty''', but later the city was renamed Teresina, in honor of Empress [[Teresa Cristina of the Two Sicilies|Teresa Cristina]], the wife of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] of Brazil.
 
Teresina is the hottest city in the country and the city with the third-highest incidence of lightning in the world. Nowadays{{When|date=January 2024}}, Teresina's economy is based on international manufacturing industries and trade.

== Geography ==
[[File:Vista do mirante da ponte estaiada de Teresina.jpg|thumb|left|Teresina seen from João Isidoro França Bridge Observatory.]]

Teresina is located on the east side of the Parnaíba river at the border with [[Maranhão]] state, at an altitude of about 72 meters. The city faces the city of Timon across the river and is situated between the Parnaíba river and its tributary the Poti River. The two rivers join at the city's northern end, where there is an environmental park with gazebos. Teresina is the largest capital in the northeastern territorial extension, at 1,756&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

Located in a transition zone between the northeast and the Amazon (Mid-North), Teresina is surrounded by mata dos cocais, savannas and cerradões where many carnaúba, babaçu, buriti palms, jatobás, ipês, and many other medium-sized trees can  be seen. In the region there are also remnants of Teresina Atlantic Forest, which makes the landscape shrub coverage very rich and dense.

=== Climate ===
Teresina has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Aw'') with semi-humid characteristics and two seasons: the rainy season (which occurs in summer and autumn of the [[southern hemisphere]]) and the dry season (which occurs in winter and spring).

From January to May, due to the rains, the weather is hot and wet (likely to occur when there is fog in the morning), while from June to August the climate gets dry with relatively milder nights; in September to December the weather becomes hotter and humid decreases, with the gradual return of rainy conditions from October. This period is referred to as "Bro" by locals as the hottest months end with -bro in Portuguese: ''{{lang|pt|setembro}}'', ''{{lang|pt|outubro}}'', ''{{lang|pt|novembro}}'', and ''{{lang|pt|dezembro}}''. A peculiar feature of the rains in the city are their speed and intensity, with strong winds, large force of water and very common lightning. The annual rainfall stands at around {{convert|1,325|mm|in|0|disp=or}}. The highest recorded daily precipitation was {{convert|125|mm|in|0|}}.<ref name =NCEI/>

Hot most of the year, Teresina has an average temperature around {{convert|27|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}, with a minimum of {{convert|20|°C|°F|disp=or}} in July and a maximum of {{convert|36|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} in October. The lowest ever recorded in Teresina was {{convert|11.9|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} in June, while the record hot temperature exceeds {{convert|40|°C|°F|disp=or}} (October and November). Annually, there are approximately 129.4 days in which the maximum daily temperature reaches or exeeds {{convert|35|C|F|0|}}.<ref name=NCEI/> These fluctuations are mitigated by the contribution of the winds. Air quality is considered good in Teresina, except in the driest period, when the relative humidity drops, and there are occurrences of fires.
