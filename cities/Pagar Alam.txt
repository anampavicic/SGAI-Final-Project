'''Pagar Alam''' (sometimes written as '''Pagaralam''', [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: {{script/Arabic|ڤاݢر عالم}}), is a city in [[South Sumatra]], [[Indonesia]]. It was formerly part of [[Lahat Regency]], from which it was separated as an independent city on 21 June 2001; before being established as an independent city, Pagar Alam was an administrative city within Lahat Regency. It has an area of 633.66&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup><ref>[http://www.pagaralam.go.id/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=12&Itemid=30 LETAK GEOGRAFI DAN TOPOGRAFI DAERAH]</ref> and a population of 126,181 at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 143,844 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 150,881 (comprising 77,147 males and 73,734 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Pagar Alam Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.1672)</ref>

Pagar Alam is located by the [[Bukit Barisan]] Mountains, at the foot of [[Mount Dempo]] (''Gunung Dempo''), a volcano and the highest mountain in South Sumatra, which towers to a height of 3,159m to the west of the town. It is 298&nbsp;km southwest from the province's capital city of [[Palembang]] and 60&nbsp;km southwest of the town of [[Lahat (town)|Lahat]]. The city is bounded by [[Bengkulu]] Province to the south, Jarai District to the north, Kota Agung District to the east and Tanjung Sakti Pumi District to the west. Pagar Alam is one of the main suppliers of vegetables in Palembang. Its location in the highland makes the city slightly cooler than many of the other South Sumatra cities; this, together with its astounding landscape, makes the city one of the main tourist destinations in South Sumatra and it is often visited by local tourists, especially from Palembang. Currently, the city is led by [[Ida Fitriati|Alpian Maskoni]] as the mayor of the city.

==Geography==
Pagar Alam is located by the [[Bukit Barisan]] Mountains, at the feet of [[Mount Dempo]]. It is situated on the [[Pasemah Plateau]], an extensive fertile highland plain which is surrounded by mountains. It is notable for ancient stone [[megalith]]s which surround the town on all sides and are the remnants of a [[Bronze Age]] culture. Much of the soil in the city consists of [[latosol]] and [[andisol]] with rugged and hilly topography. The soil in this city is classified as soil with high fertility (class I).

==Demography==
In 2000, Pagar Alam's population was only 112,025 and it increased to 126,181 ten years later, and 143,844 after a further decade. One of the factors in the population increase has been the settlement of migrants who want to live in this city. Beside the city's native inhabitants, the Malay (Besemah), the city population also consists of several other groups, such as the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minang]], [[Batak]], [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Arabs]], and [[Indian people|Indians]].

==Administrative Districts==
Pagar Alam is administratively divided into five [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011"/> and 2020<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021"/> Censuses, together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Pagar Alam Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.1672)</ref> The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centresw, the number of [[administrative village]]s (all classed as urban ''kelurahan'') in each district, and its postal codes.
