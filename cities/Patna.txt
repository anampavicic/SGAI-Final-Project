[[Megasthenes]], the Indo-Greek historian and ambassador to the court of Chandragupta Maurya, gave one of the earliest accounts of the city.

Megasthenes informs us that this city stretched in the inhabited quarters to an extreme length on each side of eighty stadia, and that its breadth was fifteen stadia, and that a ditch encompassed it all round, which was six hundred feet in breadth and thirty cubits in depth, and that the wall was crowned with 570 towers and had four-and-sixty gates....|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621065424/http://www.mssu.edu/projectsouthasia/history/primarydocs/Foreign_Views/GreekRoman/Megasthenes-Indika.htm |archive-date=21 June 2008 |access-date=24 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/3038.html |title=Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology |volume=3 |page=704 |editor=Smith, Sir William |year=1870 |publisher=Little, Brown |location=Boston |access-date=25 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018045710/http://ancientlibrary.com/smith-bio/3038.html |archive-date=18 October 2007 }}</ref> [[Megasthenes]], the Greek ambassador to India, described the city as the greatest city on earth during its heyday.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/india/gal_india_south.shtml |title=History&nbsp;– Ancient History in depth: The Story of India: South India |publisher=BBC |date=5 November 2009 |access-date=1 February 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113135122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ancient/india/gal_india_south.shtml |archive-date=13 January 2010 }}</ref> The Shungas ultimately retained control of Pataliputra and ruled for almost 100 years.

[[Mughal Emperor]] [[Aurangzeb]] acceded to the request of his favourite grandson, [[Azim-ush-Shan|Prince Muhammad Azim]], to rename Patna as [[Azimabad]], in 1704 while Azim was in Patna as the [[subedar]]. Patna or Azimabad did see some violent activities, according to Phillip Mason, writing in the book "The Men Who Ruled India". "Aurangzeb had restored the poll tax (Jazia) on unbelievers, which had to be compounded for. In Patna, Peacock, the factory's chief, was not sufficiently obedient. He was seized, forced to walk through the town bare-headed and bare-footed, and subjected to many other indignities before he paid up and was released." Little changed during this period other than the name. With the decline of the Mughal empire, Patna moved into the hands of the [[Nawabs of Bengal]], who levied a heavy tax on the populace but allowed it to flourish as a commercial centre. The mansions of the Maharaja of [[Tekari Raj]] dominated the Patna riverfront in 1811–12.<ref>{{cite book

=== Portuguese Empire ===
As trade grew, settlements of the Portuguese empire expanded to the Bengal Gulf. Since at least 1515, the Portuguese were in Bengal as traders, and later in 1521, an embassy was sent to Gaur to create factories in the region. The Bengal Sultan after 1534 allowed the Portuguese to develop several settlements as Chitagoong e Satgaon.<ref>{{Cite book|title = India in Canada: Canada in India editado por Taniya Gupta, Antonia Navarro-Tejero|isbn = 9781443855716|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=EmYxBwAAQBAJ&q=Ghiyasuddin%20Mahmud%20Shah%20Portugueses&pg=PA22|last1 = Gupta|first1 = Taniya|last2 = Navarro-Tejero|first2 = Antonia|date = 8 January 2014| publisher=Cambridge Scholars |access-date = 7 October 2020|archive-date = 30 June 2021|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210630163654/https://books.google.com/books?id=EmYxBwAAQBAJ&q=Ghiyasuddin+Mahmud+Shah+Portugueses&pg=PA22|url-status = live}}</ref> In 1535 the Portuguese were allied with the Bengal sultan and held the Teliagarhi pass<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Ghiyasuddin Mahmud Shah|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Ghiyasuddin_Mahmud_Shah|encyclopedia=Banglapedia|access-date=12 May 2020|archive-date=23 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200623101404/http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Ghiyasuddin_Mahmud_Shah|url-status=live}}</ref> 280&nbsp;km from Patna helping to avoid the invasion by the Mughals.

===British Empire===
During the 17th century, Patna became a centre of international trade.<ref name="google1"/> In 1620, the [[Kingdom of England|English]] [[East India Company]] established a [[Factory (trading post)|factory]] in Patna for trading in [[calico (textile)|calico]] and [[silk]]. Soon it became a trading centre for [[saltpetre]]. Francois Bernier, in ''Travels in the Mogul Empire'' (1656–1668), says, ". It was carried down the Ganges with great facility, and the Dutch and English sent large cargoes to many parts of the Indies, and Europe". This trade encouraged other Europeans, principally the French, Danes, Dutch, and Portuguese, to compete in the lucrative business. [[Peter Mundy]], writing in 1632, described Patna as "the greatest mart of the eastern region".<ref name="hoparoundindia1"/> After the decisive [[Battle of Buxar]] of 1764, as per the treaty of Allahabad [[East India Company]] was given the right to collect a tax of this former Mughal province by the Mughal emperor. Patna was annexed by the company in 1793 to its territory when Nizamat (Mughal suzerainty) was abolished, and the British East India Company took control of the province of Bengal-Bihar. Patna, however, continued as a trading centre. In 1912, when the [[Bengal Presidency]] was partitioned, Patna became the capital of the British province of [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar and Orissa]]. However, in 1936 [[Orissa, India|Orissa]] became a separate entity with its capital. To date, a major population of Bengalis lives in Patna particularly.<ref name="capital">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a-QaOP5nK-MC&q=Bihar+and+Orissa+Province+capital&pg=PA166 |title=Bihar And Orissa District Gazetteers Patna&nbsp;– L.S.S.

It is an alluvial, flat expanse of land. The land in the district is too fertile and is almost entirely cultivated with no forest cover. Alluvial soil is ideal for cultivating rice, sugarcane, and other food grains. The area under cultivation is studded with mango orchards and bamboo groves. In the fields along the banks of river Ganges, weeds such as ammannia, citriculari, hygrophile and sesbania grow. But palmyra, date palm, and mango orchards are found near habitations. Dry stretches of shrubbery are sometimes seen in the villages far from the rivers. Trees commonly found are bel, siris, jack fruit, and the red cotton tree.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://patna.bih.nic.in/District/dist_home.htm |title=About District |publisher=Patna.bih.nic.in |date=1 January 2004 |access-date=17 July 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509090413/http://patna.bih.nic.in/District/dist_home.htm |archive-date=9 May 2013 }}</ref> Patna is unique in having four large rivers in its vicinity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/patna/ |title=Patna Maps, Bihar |publisher=Mapsofindia.com |date=29 September 2011 |access-date=4 December 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318134143/http://www.mapsofindia.com/maps/patna/ |archive-date=18 March 2014 }}</ref> It is the largest riverine city in the world.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://futureofpower.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Patna-Summary-Report.pdf | title=Summary Report of Patna | publisher=future of power | access-date=2 June 2014 | url-status=live | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140605052641/http://futureofpower.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Patna-Summary-Report.pdf | archive-date=5 June 2014 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> The topography of Patna city is saucer shaped as per Patna City Development Plan prepared in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1160909/jsp/bihar/story_107083.jsp#.V9L7uvB97IU|title=Smart city?

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Patna}}
[[File:Maurya Lok Patna.jpg|thumb|[[Maurya Lok]] is a major shopping area of the city, and one of the oldest]]

Since the 17th century, Patna has been a centre of international trade and an agricultural and textile hub, including a major silk and calico market.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}} After [[Partition of India|gaining independence]] in 1947, the economy remained relatively stable, including growth in produce and manufacturing of vegetable oil. From the 1980s onwards, the economy experienced fluctuations. When liberalisation came to India in the 1990s, Patna did not attract significant global funds or foreign investment which proved a setback for the economy. Although the city had several fertiliser plants and sugar mills, due to a weakened ecosystem, many companies incurred losses and were eventually forced to close or leave the state.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

The economy of Patna has seen sustained growth since 2005, in particular from the [[fast-moving consumer goods]] industry, the [[service sector]], and [[Green Revolution in India|Green Revolution]] businesses.<ref name="patna-emerging" /> In 2009, the [[World Bank]] ranked Patna as the second best city in India to start a business.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/New-Delhi-Patna-best-cities-to-start-business-World-Bank/articleshow/4720294.cms | title=New Delhi, Patna best cities to start business: World Bank | date=30 June 2009 | access-date=23 October 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104223215/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-30/india-business/28178105_1_world-bank-cities-report-ranks | archive-date=4 January 2012 | url-status=live | work=[[The Times of India]] | df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 2010, Patna was ranked 21st fastest-growing city in the world and fifth fastest-growing city in India, and was forecast to grow at an average annual rate of 3.72% through 2020.<ref name="cmf">{{cite web |url=http://www.citymayors.com/statistics/urban_growth1.html |title=World's fastest growing urban areas (1) |publisher=City Mayors |access-date=4 March 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101125090345/http://citymayors.com/statistics/urban_growth1.html |archive-date=25 November 2010 }}</ref>

Patna's native language is Magahi or [[Magadhi]] a language derived from the ancient [[Magadhi Prakrit]],<ref>South Asian folklore: an encyclopedia: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, By Peter J. Claus, Sarah Diamond, Margaret Ann Mills, Routledge, 2003, p. 203</ref> which was created in the ancient kingdom of [[Magadha (Mahajanapada)|Magadha]], the core of which was the area of Patna south of the [[Ganges]]. It is believed to be the language spoken by [[Gautama Buddha]]. Patna has a vibrant Bengali culture too with many Bengali stalwarts including the first Chief Minister of post-independence West Bengal, Bidhan Chandra Ray, being born here.
