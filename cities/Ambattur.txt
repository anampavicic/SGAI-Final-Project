'''Ambattur''' is a northwestern part of [[Chennai]], India. It is located in [[Ambattur taluk]] of the [[Chennai District]], surrounded by [[Avadi]], [[Anna Nagar]], [[Korattur]], [[Padi, Chennai|Padi]], [[Mogappair]], [[Kallikuppam]], 
[[Surapattu|Surapet]], [[Ayappakkam]], Athipet and [[Thiruverkadu]]. It covers an area of {{cvt|40.36|sqkm}}. The neighbourhood is served by [[Ambattur (Chennai Suburban Railway)|Ambattur railway station]] of the [[Chennai Suburban Railway]]. Ambattur has its origins in a village of the same name which can be located at present as areas opposite to Ambattur telephone exchange. Ambattur was a village with large extents of agricultural farm lands irrigated by the once-sprawling [[Ambattur Lake]]. In 2011, the neighborhood had a population 466,205.

==Etymology==
This place is one of 108 ''Shakthi Sthals'' in the country. The Amman temple (for the Hindu deity [[Durga]]) here is the fifty-first in the order, giving the locality the Tamil name "aimbaththu onraam oor" (ஐம்பத்து ஒன்றாம் ஊர்), meaning fifty-first place/temple village, which later transmuted as Ambattur. The goddess is worshiped in the form of [[Vaishnavi (deity)|Vaishnavi]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Ambattur is also called so because it was a collaboration of 51 small towns (ambathu onraam oor in Tamil), from which the name ''Ambattur'' was derived.<ref>{{Cite news |last=V |first=Sriram |date=2023-10-17 |title=Ambattur OT— what's in a name? |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/chennai/ambattur-ot-whats-in-a-name/article67425774.ece |access-date=2024-05-13 |work=The Hindu |language=en-IN |issn=0971-751X}}</ref>

==History==
Along with [[Avadi]], [[Sembium]], [[Ennore]] and [[Tiruvottriyur]], Ambattur is part of the "auto belt" in the city's industrial north and west regions that developed when the automobile industry developed in Madras, in the early post-[[World War II]] years.<ref>{{cite book | last = Muthiah| first = S. | author-link = S. Muthiah | title = Madras Rediscovered| publisher = EastWest | date = 2014 | location = Chennai | pages = 144 | isbn = 978-93-84030-28-5}}</ref> Sir Ivan Stedeford, chairman of Tube Investments, United Kingdom, was instrumental in starting the TI factory and TII complex in the country. Sir Ivan signed a joint venture agreement with A. M. Murugappa Chettiar of the [[Murugappa Group]], which was then a small business house manufacturing sandpaper and abrasives for the war effort and also trading war surplus. It was the first joint venture agreement to be signed in South India after Independence. This resulted in the establishment of the TI Cycle factory in a mango grove in Ambattur by 1951, and manufacture of the 'Hercules India' bicycle soon began. By 1954, the word 'India' was dropped from the name when international quality standards were met.<ref name="Hindu_SirIvanOfAmbattur">{{cite news

In 1954, Sir Ivan signed his second joint venture, Tube Products India, with the Murugappa family. The factory was established on what had been the British Government of Malaya's Immigration Camp. By 1956, production was started in the new factory and soon resulted in the establishment of other TI factories in the Ambattur-Avadi industrial stretch. This led to a rapid growth in population in the region and several public amenities were established in Ambattur by TI company, such as the [[Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar Higher Secondary School|Sir Ramaswamy Mudaliar Higher Secondary School]] (named after the person who had initially introduced the partners to each other), a post office and a bank. When the growing population demanded a hospital, the company established one between Ambattur and Avadi in 1966 from a gift of around £5,000 from Sir Ivan. The hospital was named the [[Sir Ivan Stedeford Hospital]] in his honour.<ref name="Hindu_SirIvanOfAmbattur"/>

==Administration==
Ambattur comes under the [[Sriperumbudur]] Parliamentary constituency. It was previously under the North Chennai parliamentary constituency, and, along with [[Villivakkam]], it was the largest assembly constituency in India. The Fame organisation sangam originated here. The [[delimitation]] process of assembly constituencies had given Ambattur a new identity of its own: Constituency No. 8, Tamil Nadu.  Once a major panchayat, Ambattur was made a township in the 1960s and a selection-grade municipality from April 1975. In May 1992, it was raised to special-grade municipality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://municipality.tn.gov.in/Ambattur/about_municipality.html |title=Ambattu Municipality Overview |access-date=2010-11-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100828112725/http://municipality.tn.gov.in/ambattur/about_municipality.html |archive-date=2010-08-28 }}</ref> It was a municipality till October 2011.
