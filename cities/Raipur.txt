== History  ==
Raipur district, like the rest of the Chhattisgarh plain, was once known as Dakshina Kosala and considered to be under [[Maurya Empire]].{{cn|date=September 2024}} In Arang near Raipur, a Gupta inscription dated to the 6th century CE shows Gupta hegemony over the region. In the 7th century CE, the region was ruled by a Buddhist kingdom in Bhandak in modern-day Maharashtra and was described by [[Xuanzang]].{{cn|date=September 2024}} A branch of this family later migrated to Sirpur in present-day Mahasamund district, and later took control of the entirety of Dakshina Kosala.{{cn|date=September 2024}} This kingdom's prosperity reached its height with Tivaradeva. His son inscribed almost all temples in Sirpur.{{cn|date=September 2024}} They were later ousted by the Sharabpuriyas, who took control of the rest of Chhattisgarh and ruled for several centuries.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

By the early 9th century the Kalachuris gained control of the region. The [[Kalachuris of Ratnapura]] ruled Ratnapur until the 13th century. By the 14th century, the Kalachuris of Raipur branch gained power. One king of the Raipur branch conquered 18 garh, or forts, of the enemy - lending an etymology to Chhattisgarh, the 36 forts. By the 18th century Kalachuris became the overlords of entire Chattisgarh region.{{cn|date=September 2024}}
