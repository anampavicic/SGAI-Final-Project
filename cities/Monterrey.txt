The uninterrupted settlement of Monterrey was founded by [[Diego de Montemayor]] in 1596. In the years after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], Monterrey became an important business center. The city experienced great industrial growth following the establishment of the [[Monterrey Foundry]] in 1900. The city has prominent positions in sectors such as steel, cement, glass, auto parts, and brewing. Monterrey's economic growth has been attributed in part to its proximity to the United States-Mexico border and economic links to the United States.<ref name=buyusa/><ref>{{cite web |last=Day |first=Paul |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/travel/bzm/bzmmonterreyreport.html |title=Monterrey: In Mexico, the North Star shines : Mexico Business |publisher=Mexconnect.com |date=July 1, 2000 |access-date=November 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219050008/http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/travel/bzm/bzmmonterreyreport.html |archive-date=February 19, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The city is named after [[Gaspar de Zúñiga, 5th Count of Monterrey]], who was viceroy of New Spain from 1595 to 1603. His family originated in [[Monterrei]], Galicia, Spain.

==History==
{{see also|History of Monterrey|Timeline of Monterrey, Mexico|History of Nuevo León}}

===Prehispanic history===
Before the European foundation of the city, there was no established nation-state, and the population consisted of some indigenous [[nomad]] groups. [[Carved stone]] and [[cave painting]] in surrounding mountains and caves have allowed historians to identify four major groups in present-day Monterrey: ''Azalapas'', ''Huachichiles'', ''[[Coahuiltecan people|Coahuiltecos]]'' and ''Borrados''.<ref name="elocal-hist">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/nuevoleon/hist.htm |title=Historia – Nuevo León |publisher=e-local.gob.mx |access-date=July 2, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110816015515/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/nuevoleon/hist.htm |archive-date=August 16, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Foundation===
[[File:Plano de la ciudad de Monterrey, 1791.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Monterrey 1791]]

In the 16th century, the valley in which Monterrey sits was known as the [[Extremadura Valley]], an area largely unexplored by the Spanish colonizers. The first expeditions and colonization attempts were led by conquistador [[Alberto del Canto]], who named the city '''Santa Lucia''', but they were unsuccessful because the Spanish were attacked by the natives and fled. The Spanish expeditionary [[Luis Carvajal y de la Cueva]] negotiated with [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip II]] of Spain to establish a territory in northern [[New Spain]] that would be called [[Nuevo León]], the "[[New Kingdom of León]]". In 1580, he arrived in the newly granted lands but it was not until 1582 that he established a settlement called '''San Luis Rey de Francia''' (named for [[Louis IX|Saint Louis IX of France]]) within present-day Monterrey. The New Kingdom of León extended westward from the port of [[Tampico]] to the limits of [[Nueva Vizcaya, New Spain|Nueva Vizcaya]] ("New Biscay", now State of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]), and around 1,000&nbsp;kilometers northward. For eight years Nuevo León was abandoned and uninhabited, until a third expedition of 13 families led by conquistador [[Diego de Montemayor]] founded the ''Ciudad Metropolitana de Nuestra Señora de Monterrey'' ("Metropolitan City of Our Lady of Monterrey") on September 20, 1596, next to a water spring called ''Ojos de Agua de Santa Lucia'', where the Museum of Mexican History and [[Santa Lucía riverwalk]] are now.

During the years of Spanish rule, Monterrey remained a small city, and its population varied from a few hundred to only dozens. The city facilitated trade between [[San Antonio]] (now in Texas), [[Tampico]] and from [[Saltillo]] to the center of the country. Tampico's port brought many products from Europe, while Saltillo concentrated the Northern Territories' trade with the capital, [[Mexico City]]. San Antonio was the key trade point with the northern foreign colonies (British and French).{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===After Mexican Independence (19th century)===
[[File:Monterrey to the west October 1846.jpg|thumb|Monterrey in 1846]]
In the 19th century, after the [[Mexican Independence War]], Monterrey rose as a key economic center for the newly formed nation, especially due to its balanced ties between Europe (with its connections to Tampico), the United States (with its connections to San Antonio), and the capital (through Saltillo). In 1824, the "New Kingdom of León" became the State of [[Nuevo León]], and Monterrey was selected as its capital. But the political instability that followed the first 50 years of the new country allowed two American invasions and an internal secession war, during which the governor of the state annexed [[Coahuila]] and [[Tamaulipas]] states, designating Monterrey as the capital of the [[Republic of the Sierra Madre]] as it did before in 1840 for the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

In 1846, the earliest large-scale engagement of the [[Mexican–American War]] took place in the city, known as the [[Battle of Monterrey]]. Mexican forces were forced to surrender but only after successfully repelling U.S. forces' first few advances on the city. The battle inflicted high casualties on both sides, much of them resulting from hand-to-hand combat within the walls of the city center. Many of the generals in the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|Mexican War against France]] were natives of the city, including [[Mariano Escobedo]], [[Juan Zuazua]] (b. Lampazos de Naranjo, NL) and [[Jerónimo Treviño]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

The brewery [[Cervecería Cuauhtémoc]], one of the milestone local enterprises, was founded in 1890.

===20th century===
[[File:Monterrey entre el Obispado y el Cerro de la Silla 1904.jpg|thumb|View of Monterrey and Cerro de la Silla in 1904]]

During the last decade of the 19th century, Monterrey was linked by railroad, which benefitted industry. It was during this period that [[José Eleuterio González]] founded the [[University Hospital]], now one of northeast Mexico's best public hospitals, affiliated with the School of Medicine of the [[Universidad Autónoma de Nuevo León|Autonomous University of Nuevo León (UANL)]]. Antonio Basagoiti and other citizens founded the ''Fundidora de Fierro y Acero de Monterrey''.<ref name="Fundidora_de_Fierro_y_Acero_de_Monterrey">{{Cite web |url=https://www.parquefundidora.org/?id_cont=5&plantilla=01a.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020165539/http://www.parquefundidora.org/index.php?plantilla=01a.php&id_cont=5 |url-status=dead |title=Parque Fundidora |archive-date=October 20, 2013 |website=www.parquefundidora.org }}</ref>

A steel-producing company that accelerated the already fast industrialization of the city was founded in 1900 and became one of the world's biggest. In 1986, Monterrey hosted several games of the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

In 1988, [[Hurricane Gilbert]] caused great damage to the city; the previously dry [[Santa Catarina River (Mexico)|Santa Catarina River]] overflowed, causing over 100 deaths and economic damage.<ref name="Hurricane’s Remnants Head Northeast; Flooding Ebbs in Mexico">{{cite news |title=Hurricane's Remnants Head Northeast; Flooding Ebbs in Mexico |url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-09-20-mn-2327-story.html |access-date=November 8, 2023 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 20, 1988 |archive-date=November 8, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231108112930/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1988-09-20-mn-2327-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

===21st century===
The city has hosted international events such as the 2002 [[United Nations|United Nations Conference on Financing for Development]] with the participation of more than 50 heads of state and government, as well as other ministers and senior delegates from over 150 countries. The conference resulted in the adoption of the [[Monterrey Consensus]], which has become a reference point for international development and cooperation. In 2004, the [[Organization of American States|OAS]] [[Monterrey Special Summit of the Americas|Special Summit of the Americas]] was attended by almost all the presidents of the Americas.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

In 2007, Monterrey held the [[2007 Universal Forum of Cultures|Universal Forum of Cultures]], with four million visitors. In 2008, Monterrey held the FINA World Junior Championships.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 2010, Monterrey was hit by another damaging storm, [[Hurricane Alex (2010)|Hurricane Alex]] which was considered worse than [[Hurricane Gilbert]], with record-breaking rain bringing floods and causing severe economic damage. Damage estimates totaled US$1.885 billion and $16.9 billion MXN. Reconstruction and urban renewal ensued. Recently, the [[Nuevo León Development Plan 2030]] was presented, along with some other metropolitan projects.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In August 2011 the city was the scene of a [[2011 Monterrey casino attack|terror attack on a casino]], in which more than 50 people were killed.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/08/26/mexico.attack/index.html |title=52 killed in attack at Mexican casino |work=CNN |access-date=January 18, 2018 |language=en |archive-date=January 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119001158/http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/americas/08/26/mexico.attack/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Santa Catarina River—dry most of the year on the surface but with flowing underground water—bisects Monterrey from east to west, separating the city into north and south halves, and drains the city to the [[San Juan River (Tamaulipas)|San Juan River]] and [[Rio Grande]].

Monterrey is adjacent to [[San Nicolás de los Garza]], [[García, Nuevo León|García]] and [[General Escobedo]] to the north; [[Guadalupe, Nuevo León|Guadalupe]], [[Juárez, Nuevo León|Juárez]] and [[Cadereyta Jiménez]] to the east; [[Santiago, Nuevo León|Santiago]] to the south; and [[San Pedro Garza García]] and [[Santa Catarina, Nuevo León|Santa Catarina]] to the west.

Monterrey lies north of the foothills of the [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] [[mountain range]]. A small hill, the [[Cerro del Topo Chico|Cerro del Topo]], and the smaller [[Cerro del Topo Chico|Topo Chico]] are in the suburbs of San Nicolás de los Garza and Escobedo. West of the city rises the [[Cerro de las Mitras]] (Mountain of the Mitres), which resemble the profile of several bishops with their [[mitre]]s.

[[Cerro de la Silla]] (Saddle Mountain) dominates the view at the east of the city and is considered a major symbol of the city. [[Cerro de la Loma Larga]]—South of the Santa Catarina river—separates Monterrey from the suburb of San Pedro Garza García. At the summit of the [[Cerro del Obispado]], north of the river, is the historic [[Cerro del Obispado|Bishopric Palace]], site of one of the most important battles of the [[Mexican–American War]].

===Climate===
[[File:Skymty.jpg|thumb|left|Intense cloud layer over Monterrey]]
Monterrey has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh''), not having enough precipitation for a [[humid subtropical climate]]. Being inland at a modest elevation, it is one of the warmest major cities in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weather.com/ |title=National and Local Weather Forecast, Hurricane, Radar and Report |publisher=Weather.com |access-date=April 17, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140509161400/http://www.weather.com/ |archive-date=May 9, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref> Summers are generally hot, spring and fall temperate, and winters mild, with temperatures rarely below freezing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=049367&refer= |title=Monterrey, Nuevo León Travel Weather Averages |publisher=Weatherbase |access-date=November 17, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229121744/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=049367&refer= |archive-date=December 29, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The average high in August is {{cvt|36|°C|°F}} and the average low is {{cvt|24|°C|°F}}. The average January high is {{cvt|22|°C|°F}} and the average low in January is {{cvt|10|°C|°F}}. Rainfall is scarce in winter, but more frequent during May through September.

Monterrey frequently experiences extreme weather changes; for example, it sometimes reaches {{cvt|30|°C|°F}} in January and February, the coldest months. The most extreme weather changes in summer occur with rainfall, which can reduce temperatures significantly, and the temporary absence of the ''northern winds'' in winter, which can lead to abnormally high temperatures. Seasons are not well defined; the warm season may start in February and may last until September. In April and May 2011 temperatures reached {{cvt|45|°C|°F}} or higher, causing fires and extreme heat. Snow is a very rare event, although an accumulation of {{cvt|20|in|cm|-1|abbr=in|order=flip}} in 8&nbsp;hours occurred in January 1967.<ref name="Winkler">{{cite journal |last=Winkler |first=William |title=The Weather and Circulation of January 1967 |journal=Monthly Weather Review |volume=95 |issue=4 |pages=227–233 |url=http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/095/mwr-095-04-0227.pdf |access-date=January 29, 2013 |year=1967 |doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1967)095<0227:ammwuh>2.3.co;2 |bibcode=1967MWRv...95..227W |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522204642/http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/mwr/095/mwr-095-04-0227.pdf |archive-date=May 22, 2013 |url-status=live |doi-access=free }}</ref> The most recent snowfall was in February 2021.

From June 30 to July 2, 2010, Monterrey was hit by the worst natural disaster in the city's history when [[Hurricane Alex (2010)|Hurricane Alex]] delivered more than {{cvt|584|mm|in|0}} of rain in 72&nbsp;hours, with areas reaching up to {{cvt|1|m|in|0}} of rain during that same period, destroying homes, avenues, highways and infrastructure, and leaving up to 200,000 families without water for a week or more. The amount of water that fell was equivalent to the average precipitation for a year. This was about 3–4 times as much rain as [[Hurricane Gilbert]] produced in the city on September 15, 1988. The death toll of Hurricane Alex was estimated to be around 20.

In 2005, Monterrey was ranked one of the safest cities in Mexico,<ref>''América Economía'' (Business Magazine), page 32, issue of May 2005</ref> and one of the two safest in 2006.

Drug dealers are a major concern, although military offensives and police captures of important drug-cartel chiefs have weakened cartels trying to settle in the city.

Another famous local dish is ''[[machacado con huevo]]''.

''[[Carne asada]]'' on weekends remains a tradition among Monterrey families. It is usually served with grilled onions, baked potatoes and [[sausage]]s or chopped as [[taco]]s. Locally brewed beer and cola are an almost mandatory part of the weekly ritual. "Glorias" and "obleas," made from goat milk, are both traditional Nuevo León desserts.

Monterrey has a wide gastronomic variety due to its climate geography, climate, texture, a mixture of ethnics groups, and their influences, a series of unique dishes have been created through more than 400 years of history.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}
