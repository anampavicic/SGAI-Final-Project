[[File:Plan of Bijapur India 1911.jpg|thumb|300px|Plan of Bijapur, 1911|left]]

=== Early history ===
The Bijapur district is historically, traditionally and legendarily, one of the richest districts in the state. Evidence found here reveals that it was an inhabited place since the Stone Age. The history of this district is divided into four periods, from the Chalukya acquisition of Badami till the Muslim invasion.

The early [[Western Chalukya]] period lasted from about 535 to about 757; the Rastrakuta period from 757 to 973; the Kalachuri and Hoysala period from  973 to about 1200; the Devagiri Yadava period from 1185 to the Muslim conquest of Devagiri in  1312.

=== Bahmani and Bijapur Sultanates ===
{{main|Sultanate of Bijapur|Bahmani Sultanate}}
[[File:Ibrahim Rauza, Bijapur, Karnataka.jpg|thumb|[[Ibrahim Rauza]], completed in 1626 is the burial place of [[Ibrahim Adil Shah II]] and his family]]
Bijapur first came under the influence of [[Alauddin Khalji]], the [[Delhi Sultanate|Sultan of Delhi]], towards the end of the 13th century, and then under the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] in 1347. In 1347, when the Bahamani Sultanate was established, it included the southern and eastern parts of Bijapur district. The Sultanate was divided into several provinces, ([[Bahmani taraf|tarafs]]) including Bijapur. The capital of the province was Bijapur, with boundaries extending to present parts of [[North Karnataka]] south and west of [[Maharashtra]] including the [[Konkan]], and was a centre for trading overseas. The supremacy of the Bahmanis and authority over its provinces ceased by 1490. At that time five dynasties were born, and one of them was the [[Adil Shahi dynasty]]. In 1518, the Bahmani Sultanate formally split into five splinter states known as the [[Deccan sultanates]], ruled by the aforementioned five dynasties. The sultans of the Bijapur Sultanate ruled from 1490 to 1686. The city of Bijapur owes much of its greatness to [[Yusuf Adil Shah]], the founder of the independent state of Bijapur,{{citation needed|date=September 2024}} sultan [[Ali Adil Shah I]], who fortified the city and grew its working class population,{{sfn|Eaton|1978|p=86}} and [[Ibrahim Adil Shah II]] of Bijapur.{{sfn|Eaton|1978|p=89}} At its peak under the Bijapur Sultanate in the early 17th century, half a million to a million people were estimated to have inhabited the city.{{sfn|Eaton|1978|p=90}}

The Mughal emperor [[Aurangazeb]] conquered Bijapur from the Adil Shahis in 1686{{sfn|Eaton|1978|p=270}} and had two years prior turned Bijapur into a [[subah]].{{citation needed|date=September 2024}} Disease and other natural events resulting in large-scale death following the Mughal conquest significantly reduced the city's population.{{sfn|Eaton|1978|p=270}} Bijapur was under Mughal rule up to 1723. In 1724 the [[Nizam]] of [[Hyderabad State]] established his independence in the Deccan and included Bijapur within his dominion. However, his acquisition on this portion was of brief duration, and in 1760 it went into the hands of the [[Maratha Confederacy]].

=== British Colonial period ===
After the 1818 defeat of the Peshwa by the British in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]], Bijapur passed into the hands of the [[British East India Company]], and was assigned to the Maratha [[princely state]] [[Satara State|Satara]].

In 1817, war broke out between the British and the Marathas. By 1818, the whole of Bijapur was occupied by the British and was included in the territory assigned to the Raja of Satara. In 1848 the territory of Satara was obtained through the failure of heir and the British rule started. Till 1884, the Bijapur district had headquarters at Kaladagi. Bijapur was made headquarters in 1885.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

=== Post-Independence ===
After Independence, the movement for re-organisation of States gained further momentum and on 1 November 1956 a separate "Mysore State" was formed. By the wish of the people it was renamed as "Karnataka". Thus, the district Bijapur along with other Kannada speaking areas became a part of "Karnataka State" on 1 November 1956.

Central government had approved the request to rename the city in October 2014 from Bijapur to "Vijayapura" on 1 November 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Prabhu |first1=Nagesh |title=Good morning, Bengaluru |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/from-bangalore-to-bengaluru/article6553314.ece|access-date=1 November 2014|work=The Hindu |date=1 November 2014 }}</ref>

== Geography ==
Bijapur is located 519&nbsp;km from the state capital [[Bangalore]], 163&nbsp;km from [[Kalaburagi]], 196&nbsp;km from [[Hubli]], 212&nbsp;km from [[Belagavi]]. Bijapur has a semi-arid climate. It is located at {{coord|16.83|N|75.7|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maps, Weather, and Airports for Bijapur, India|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/19/Bijapur.html|website=Falling Rain }}</ref> It has an average elevation of 606&nbsp;metres (1988&nbsp;ft). The district has two types of soil. The first is "deep black soil" (or yeari bhoomi), which is good for the crops like jawar, wheat, pulses, sunflower, etc. The major portion of the district consists of this kind of soil which has a great moisture-holding capacity. The second type is "red soil‟ (or masari /maddi bhoomi), which is generally poor, good for irrigation and horticulture.

Krishna river is the most important river of the district. It flows about 125 miles in the district. A dam is built across the river at Almatti. Bhima river flows in northern part of district for about 20 miles. It overflows in the rainy season and spreads over a wider area, which is thereby rendered extremely fertile land. In central part of district Doni river flows.

The climate of Bijapur district is generally dry and healthy. In summer, especially in April and May, it is very hot; at that time the temperature lays between 40-degrees Celsius to 42-degrees Celsius. In the winter season, from November to January, the temperature is between 15-degrees Celsius to 20-degrees Celsius. Usually the district has dry weather, so the humidity varies from 10% to 30%. The district has 34 rain gauge stations. The average annual rainfall for the whole district is 552.8&nbsp;mm, with 37.2 rainy days. The monsoon generally reaches the district by June and lasts till October. Though the total rainfall is not high, the district benefits both from the south-west and the north-east monsoons. The annual rainfall varies from place to place within the district.{{Weather box

==Description==
The city consists of three distinct portions: the citadel, [[Bijapur Fort|the fort]] and the remains of the city. The citadel, built by the Adilshahi Sultans, a mile in circuit, is of great strength, well built of the most massive materials, and encompassed by a ditch {{convert|100|yd|m}} wide, formerly supplied with water. The fort, which was completed by the Adilshahi Sultans in 1566, is surrounded by a wall 6 m. in circumference. This wall is from 30 to {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} high, and is strengthened with ninety-six massive bastions of various designs. In addition there are ten others at the various gateways. The width is about {{convert|25|ft|m|abbr=on}}; from bastion to bastion runs a battlement curtained wall about {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}} high. The whole is surrounded by a deep moat 30 to {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on}} broad. Inside these walls the Bijapur kings bade defiance to all comers. Outside the walls are the remains of a vast city, now for the most part in ruins, but the innumerable tombs, mosques, which have resisted the havoc of time, afford abundant evidence of the ancient splendor of the place.
[[Badami]], [[Aihole]], and [[Pattadakal]], near Bijapur, are noted for their historical temples in the [[Chalukya]] architectural style.

Bijapur is nearly {{cvt|530|km}} from the state capital Bangalore. It lies between latitude 15.20 and 17.28 north and longitude 74.59 and 76.28 east. It is situated well in the interior of the Deccan Peninsula and is about 130 miles away from the west coast.

The district is bounded by [[Solapur district]] to the north and [[Sangli district]] to the north-west, [[Belgaum district]] on the west, [[Bagalkot district]] to the south, [[Gulbarga district]], [[Yadgir District]] to the east and [[Raichur District]] to the south-east.

== Sufis of Bijapur ==
[[File:Dargah Murtuza Bijapur.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Tomb or Dargah of Sufi Saint Hazrat Murtuza Quadri located at western side Bijapur]]
Arrival of [[Sufis]] in the Bijapur region was started during the reign of [[Qutbuddin Aibak]]. During this period [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] was under the control of native [[Hindu]] rulers and Palegars. Shaikh Haji Roomi was the first to arrive in Bijapur with his companions. Although his other comrades like Shaikh Salahuddin, Shaikh Saiful Mulk and Syed Haji Makki were settled in [[Pune]], Haidra and Tikota respectively.

According to Tazkiraye Auliyae Dakkan i.e., Biographies of the saints of the Deccan, compiled by Abdul Jabbar Mulkapuri in 1912–1913, 
{{cquote|Sufi Sarmast was one of the earliest sufi of this region. He came to the Deccan from [[Arab]]ia in the 13th Century at a time when the Deccan was a land of unbelievers with no sign of Islam or correct faith anywhere. His companions, pupils (fakir), disciples (murid), and soldiers (ghazi), numbered over seven hundred. He settled in Sagar in Solapur district. There, a zealous and anti-Muslim raja named Kumaram (Kumara Rama) wished to expel Sufi Sarmast, and his companions having also prepared to a struggle, a bitter fight ensued. Heroes on both sides were slain. Finally the raja was killed by the hand of his daughter. Countless Hindus were killed, and at this time Lakhi Khan Afghan and Nimat Khan came from [[Delhi]] to assist him. Hindus were defeated and the Muslims were victorious. The rest of the Hindus, having accepted tributary status, made peace. Since by nature he was fundamentally not combative, Sufi Sarmast spread the religion of [[Muhammad|Mohammed]] and befriended the hearts of Hindus. Having seen his fine virtue s and uncommon justice, many Hindus of that time accepted Islam, finally he died in the year A.H.680 i.e., 1281 A.D.{{sfn|Eaton|1978|p=22}}}}

After this period arrival of Sufis in Bijapur and suburbs was started. Ainuddin Gahjul Ilm Dehelvi narrates that Ibrahim Sangane was one of the early Sufis of Bijapur parish. Sufis of Bijapur can be divided into three categories according to period of their arrival viz., Sufis before [[Bahmani]] and / or Adil Shahi Dynasty, Sufis during Adil Shahi Dynasty and Sufis after the fall of Adil Shahi Dynasty. And further it can be classified as Sufis as warriors, Sufis as social reformers, Sufis as scholars, poets and writers.

Ibrahim Zubairi writes in his book Rouzatul Auliyae Beejapore (compiled during 1895) which describes that more than 30 tombs or Dargahs are there in Bijapur with more than 300 ''Khankahs'' i.e., Islamic Missionary Schools with notable number of disciples of different lineage like ''Hasani Sadat, Husaini Sadat, Razavi Sadat, Kazmi Sadat, Shaikh Siddiquis, Farooquis, Usmanis, Alvis, Abbasees'' and other and spiritual chains like ''Quadari, Chishti, Suharwardi, Naqshbandi, Shuttari, Haidari ''etc.

''Direct railway line to [[Gulbarga]] and [[Belgaum]]''

Bijapur–[[Shahabad, Gulbarga|Shahabad]] is a proposed new railway line (via Devar Hippargi, Sindgi, Jewargi) and was sanctioned in the state budget of 2010–11.{{Citation needed|reason=No Crystal Ball|date=April 2013}}

Bijapur–[[Athani, Belgaum|Shedbal]] is a proposed new railway line (via [[Tikota]], [[Athani (Karnataka)|Athani]], [[Shedbal]]) survey has been completed and submitted to South Western Railway [[Hubli]].

GoK's intention is to develop Bijapur - [[Gulbarga]] belt as a cement & steel hub, which has created a need for a direct railway line between Bijapur and Shahabad. This would also be able to carry coal from the Jharkhand and Singareni collieries for NTPC's 4000 MW Power Project in [[Kudagi]] (Basavana Bagewadi Taluk). The Bijapur–Shahabad line would run {{cvt|156.60|km}} and be under the South Western Railway. Partial private sector financing is required; however, state government will contribute two-thirds of the project cost of the railway line, which is estimated at Rs. 12&nbsp;billion over the first five years, in a role as an investor in return for a share in the profits.

A similar proposal has been made for sugar belt on the Bijapur Athani [[Belgaum]] new line, which will also provide shorter connectivity from [[Goa]] to [[Solapur]], [[Gulbarga]], [[Bidar]], [[Nagpur]], [[Kolkata]]. The line would run {{cvt|112.3|km}} and be under South Western Railway, if project is taken into consideration it will be on 50:50 cost sharing basis on both state and railways.
