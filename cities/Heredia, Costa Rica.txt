== History ==
[[File:Escuela Republica de Argentina.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Cultural centre "Escuela República de Argentina"]]
Prior to its founding, the area around Heredia was inhabited by the native tribe that is known as the [[Huetares]], who were commanded at the coming of the Spanish by the ''[[Cacique]]'' [[Garabito]].<ref>[http://www.heredia.go.cr/en/the-city History]</ref> In 1706 settlers from [[Cartago, Costa Rica|Cartago]], set up a small church at a place they called "Alvirilla", which soon became more populated.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historical walks through Heredia {{!}} Visit Costa Rica {{!}} The official site about tourism in Costa Rica |url=https://www.visitcostarica.com/en/costa-rica/things-to-do/culture/historical-walks/heredia#:~:text=The%20founding%20of%20what%20would,the%20native%20peoples%20called%20Cubujuqui |access-date=2024-10-07 |website=www.visitcostarica.com}}</ref> Between 1716 and 1717 the settlers moved their village to the north, to a place the indigenous people called '''Cubujuquí'''. In 1736 Heredia was deemed sufficiently large to be granted its own parish, and the first incarnation of the Iglesia de la Inmaculada was built to serve as its parish church.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historical walks through Heredia {{!}} Visit Costa Rica {{!}} The official site about tourism in Costa Rica |url=https://www.visitcostarica.com/en/costa-rica/things-to-do/culture/historical-walks/heredia#:~:text=The%20founding%20of%20what%20would,the%20native%20peoples%20called%20Cubujuqui |access-date=2024-10-07 |website=www.visitcostarica.com}}</ref> In 1751, the [[Bishop of Nicaragua and Costa Rica]], Monseñor [[Pedro Agustín Morel de Santa Cruz]] supervised the founding of the first school in Heredia, which was run by the church.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historical walks through Heredia {{!}} Visit Costa Rica {{!}} The official site about tourism in Costa Rica |url=https://www.visitcostarica.com/en/costa-rica/things-to-do/culture/historical-walks/heredia#:~:text=The%20founding%20of%20what%20would,the%20native%20peoples%20called%20Cubujuqui |access-date=2024-10-07 |website=www.visitcostarica.com}}</ref> This school is now known as the [[Liceo de Heredia]]. In 1763 the town was promoted to the status of ''[[Villa]]''; it was later renamed Heredia in honor of the President of the [[Real Audiencia of Guatemala]] who had conferred the status, don [[Alonso Fernández de Heredia]]. {{small|(See also: [[Heredia (etymology)]])}} During the 18th century the area around Heredia was developed, with the founding [[Barva]] and other towns. On 31 October 1796, Padre Felix de Alvarado laid the foundation stone for the rebuilding of the [[Iglesia de la Inmaculada]]. The Municipality of Heredia was founded on 19 May 1812, and in 1824, Heredia was promoted to city by [[Juan Mora Fernández]]. The 1848 constitution made Heredia the capital of [[Heredia Province]], promoted it to ''cantón'', and assigned it seven parishes.<ref>[http://www.heredia.go.cr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=32&Itemid=6 Municipal Website]</ref>
