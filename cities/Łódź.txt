It is the capital of [[Łódź Voivodeship]], and is located {{convert|120|km|mi|sp=us|abbr=on}} south-west of [[Warsaw]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.trasa.info/wyznaczanie-trasy/lodz-warszawa|title=Łódź – Warszawa trasa i odległość na mapie • dojazd PKP, BUS, PKS|publisher=www.trasa.info|access-date=2 August 2018|archive-date=2 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180802041104/https://www.trasa.info/wyznaczanie-trasy/lodz-warszawa|url-status=live}}</ref> {{As of|2023|post=,}} Łódź has a population of 655,279,<ref name="population" /> making it the country's [[List of cities and towns in Poland|fourth largest city]].

Łódź first appears in records in 14th-century. It was granted [[city rights|town rights]] in 1423 by the Polish King [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] and it remained a private town of the [[Kuyavia]]n bishops and clergy until the late 18th century. In the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793, Łódź was annexed to [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] before becoming part of the [[Napoleon]]ic [[Duchy of Warsaw]]; the city joined [[Congress Poland]], a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] client state, at the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]]. The [[Second Industrial Revolution]] (from 1870) brought rapid growth in textile manufacturing and in population owing to the inflow of migrants, notably Germans and Jews. Ever since the industrialization of the area, the city has been [[multinational state|multinational]] and struggled with social inequalities, as documented in the novel ''[[The Promised Land (novel)|The Promised Land]]'' by [[Nobel Prize]]–winning author [[Władysław Reymont]]. The contrasts greatly reflected on the architecture of the city, where luxurious mansions coexisted with red-brick factories and dilapidated tenement houses.<ref name="staypoland.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.staypoland.com/about_lodz.htm|title=Lodz Tourism: Tourist Information Lodz, Poland|publisher=eTravel S.A.|department=staypoland.com|access-date=3 July 2016|archive-date=12 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512021414/http://www.staypoland.com/about_lodz.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

The industrial development and demographic surge made Łódź one of the largest cities in Poland. Under the German occupation during [[World War II]] Łódź was briefly renamed {{lang|de|Litzmannstadt}} after [[Karl Litzmann]]. The city's population was persecuted and its large [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jewish]] minority was forced into a walled zone known as the [[Łódź Ghetto]], from where they were sent to German [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration and extermination camps]]. The city became Poland's temporary seat of power in 1945.

Łódź experienced a sharp demographic and economic decline after 1989. It was only in the 2010s that the city began to experience revitalization of its neglected downtown area.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cysek-Pawlak |first1=Monika |last2=Krzysztofik |first2=Sylwia |date=2017 |title=Integrated Approach as a Means of Leading the Degraded Post-Industrial Areas Out of Crisis – A Case Study of Lodz |journal= IOP Conference Series: Materials Science and Engineering |volume=245 |issue=8 |pages=082036 |doi=10.1088/1757-899X/245/8/082036 |issn= 1757-8981 |eissn= 1757-899X |bibcode=2017MS&E..245h2036C |doi-access=free }}</ref><ref name= "revit">[http://lodzpost.com/lodznews/4-billion-pln-for-revitalization-of-downtown-lodz/ "4 Billion PLN for Revitalization of Downtown Łódź."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719024303/http://lodzpost.com/lodznews/4-billion-pln-for-revitalization-of-downtown-lodz/ |date=19 July 2018 }} lodzpost.com.

===Early beginnings (1332–1815)===
[[File:Lodz1577.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|{{lang|la|Sigillum oppidi Lodzia}} – seal dating back to 1577]]

Łódź first appears in a 1332 written record issued by [[Władysław the Hunchback]], [[Duchy of Łęczyca|Duke of Łęczyca]], which transferred the village of Łodzia to the [[Bishopric of Włocławek]].{{sfn|Strumiłło|2015|p=1}} The document enumerated the privileges of its inhabitants, notably the right to [[grazing|graze]] land, establish [[pasture]]s and engage in [[Wood industry|logging]].{{sfn|Brunell|2005|p=161}} In 1423, [[King of Poland]] [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] officially granted town rights to the village under [[Magdeburg Law]].{{sfn|Lerski|1996|p=324}} For centuries, it remained a small remote settlement situated among woodlands and [[marsh]]es, which was privately held by the [[Kuyavia]]n bishops.{{sfn|Podgarbi|1990|p=33}} It was administratively located in the Brzeziny County in the [[Łęczyca Voivodeship]] in the [[Greater Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Greater Poland Province]] of the Kingdom of Poland.<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Atlas historyczny Polski. Województwo sieradzkie i województwo łęczyckie w drugiej połowie XVI wieku. Część I. Mapy, plany|year=1998|language=pl|location=Warszawa|publisher=Instytut Historii [[Polish Academy of Sciences|Polskiej Akademii Nauk]]|page=3}}</ref> The economy was predominantly driven by [[agriculture]] and farming until the 19th century.{{sfn|Brunet-Jailly|2017|p=178}} The earliest two versions of the [[coat of arms]] appeared on [[seal (emblem)|seal emblems]] in 1535 and 1577, with the latter illustrating a boat-like vessel and a turned [[oar]].{{sfn|Puś|1987|p=10}}

With the [[Second Partition of Poland]] in 1793, Łódź was annexed by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]].{{sfn|Muzeum Archeologiczne i Etnograficzne w Łodzi|1976|p=48}} In 1798, the Kuyavian bishops' ownership over the region was formally revoked during the [[Secularization (church property)|secularisation of church property]].{{sfn|Rosset|1962|p=5}} The town, governed by a [[burgomaster]] ({{lang|pl|burmistrz}}), at the time had only 190 residents, 44 occupied dwellings, a church and a prison.{{sfn|Brunell|2005|p=161}} In 1806, Łódź was incorporated into the Napoleonic [[Duchy of Warsaw]].{{sfn|Muzeum Archeologiczne i Etnograficzne w Łodzi|1976|p=48}} In the aftermath of the 1815 [[Congress of Vienna]], the duchy was dissolved and the town became part of the [[Congress Kingdom of Poland]], a [[client state]] of the [[Russian Empire]].{{sfn|Malone|2007|p=210}}

===Partitions and development (1815–1918)===
[[File:Lodz 1823 Plan Osady Sukienniczej Nowe Miasto.jpg|thumb|right|One of the first city plans, illustrating the [[Land lot|housing allotments]] and new development around [[Piotrkowska Street]], 1823]]

In 1820, the government of the Congress Kingdom designated Łódź and its rural surroundings for [[Planned community|centrally planned]] industrial development.{{sfn|Larkham|Conzen|2014|p=153}} [[Rajmund Rembieliński]], head of the [[Administrative Council#Congress Poland|Administrative Council]] and prefect of [[Masovia]], became the president of a commission that subdivided the works two major phases; the first (1821–23) comprised the creation of a new city centre with an octagonal square (contemporary {{lang|pl|plac Wolności}}; Liberty Square) and arranged [[Land lot|housing allotments]] on [[greenfield land]] situated south of the old marketplace; the second stage (1824–28) involved the establishment of [[cotton mill]] colonies and a linear street system along with an arterial north-south thoroughfare, [[Piotrkowska Street|Piotrkowska]].{{sfn|Larkham|Conzen|2014|p=153}} Many of the early dwellings were timber cottages built for housing [[weaving|weavers]] ({{lang|pl|domy tkaczy}}).{{sfn|Larkham|Conzen|2014|pp=153–154}}

During this time, a sizeable number of [[Germans|German]] craftsmen settled in the city,{{sfn|Larkham|Conzen|2014|pp=153–154}} encouraged by exemptions from tax obligations.{{sfn|Susquehanna University|1975|p=51}} Their settlement in Poland was encouraged by renowned philosopher and statesman [[Stanisław Staszic]], who acted as the director of the Department of Trade, Crafts and Industry.{{sfn|Reddaway|Penson|Halecki|2016|p=279}}

[[File:Bronisław Wilkoszewski – Fabryka Tow. Ak. Poznańskiego.jpg|thumb|left|[[Izrael Poznański]]'s industrial complex ({{lang|pl|[[Manufaktura]]}}) pictured in 1895]]

In 1851, the Imperial authorities abolished a [[customs]] barrier which was imposed on Congress Poland following the failed [[November Uprising]] (1830–1831).{{sfn|Brand|Thomas|2013|p=149}} The suppression of tariffs allowed the city to freely export its goods to Russia, where the demand for textiles was high.{{sfn|Brand|Thomas|2013|p=149}} Poland's first [[steam engine|steam-powered]] loom commenced operations at Ludwik Geyer's [[White Factory]] in 1839.{{sfn|Leslie|1983|p=44}} During the first weeks of the [[January Uprising]] (1863–1864), a unit of 300 Polish insurgents entered the city without resistance and seized weapons, and later on, there were also clashes between Polish insurgents and Russian troops in the city.{{sfn|Zieliński|1913|pp=22, 35, 47}} In 1864, the inhabitants of adjacent villages were permitted to settle in Łódź [[abolition of serfdom in Poland|without restrictions]].{{sfn|Liszewski|Young|1997|p=16}} The development of railways in the region was also instrumental in expanding the textile industry; in 1865 the [[Łódź–Koluszki railway|Łódź–Koluszki line]], a branch of the [[Warsaw–Vienna railway]], was opened, thus providing a train connection to larger markets.{{sfn|Liszewski|Young|1997|pp=16–17}} In 1867, the city was incorporated into the [[Piotrków Governorate]], a local province.{{sfn|University of Łódź|1979|pp=22–23}}

The infrastructure and edifices of Łódź were built at the expense of industrialists and [[business magnate]]s, chiefly [[Karl Wilhelm Scheibler]] and [[Izrael Poznański]], who sponsored schools, hospitals, orphanages, and [[Place of worship|places of worship]].{{sfn|van Pelt|2015|p=12}} From 1872 to 1892, Poznański established a major [[Manufaktura|textile manufactory]] composed of twelve factories, power plants, worker [[tenements]], a private fire station, and a large [[Izrael Poznański Palace|eclectic palace]].{{sfn|Charles|2015|p=28}} By the end of the century, Scheibler's {{lang|pl|[[Księży Młyn (Łódź)|Księży Młyn]]|italic=no}} became one of Europe's largest industrial complexes, employing 5,000 workers within a single facility.{{sfn|Wakeman|2020}} The years 1870–1890 saw the most intense industrialisation,{{sfn|Wandycz|2001|p=161}} which was marked by social inequalities and dire working conditions.{{sfn|Blanc|2021|p=33}} Łódź soon became a notable centre of the [[socialism|socialist]] movement and the so-called [[Łódź rebellion]]<sup>([[:pl:Bunt łódzki|pl]])</sup> in May 1892 was quelled by a military intervention.{{sfn|Blanc|2021|p=33}}

[[File:Archiwum Włodzimierza Pfeiffera PL 39 596 321.png|thumb|right|The [[Łódź Cathedral|Archcathedral of St. Stanislaus Kostka]], completed in 1912, is one of Poland's tallest churches.]]

The turn of the 20th century coincided with cultural and technological progress; in 1899, the first stationary [[Movie theater|cinema]] in Poland ({{lang|pl|Gabinet Iluzji}}) was opened in Łódź.{{sfn|Cudny|2016|p=127}} In the same year, [[Józef Piłsudski]], the future [[Marshal of Poland]], settled in the city and began printing the ''[[Robotnik (1894–1939)|Robotnik]]'' (The Worker; p.&nbsp;1894–1939), an [[Polish underground press|underground newspaper]] published by the [[Polish Socialist Party]].{{sfn|Zimmerman|2022|p=138}} During the [[Łódź insurrection|June Days]] (1905), approximately 100,000 unemployed labourers went on a mass strike, barricaded the streets and clashed with troops.{{sfn|Toporowski|2013|pp=9–10}} Officially, 151 demonstrators were killed and thousands were wounded.{{sfn|Toporowski|2013|p=10}} In 1912, the [[Łódź Cathedral|Archcathedral of St. Stanislaus Kostka]] was completed and its tower at {{convert|104|m|ft}} is one of the tallest in Poland.{{sfn|Stefański|2003|p=102}}{{sfn|Bujak|2007|p=292}}

Despite the impending crisis preceding [[World War I]], Łódź grew exponentially and was one of the world's most densely populated industrial cities, with a population density of {{convert|13200|PD/km2|PD/sqmi}} by 1914.{{sfn|Liszewski|Young|1997|p=117}} In the aftermath of the [[Battle of Łódź (1914)|Battle of Łódź]] (1914), the city came under [[German Empire|Imperial German]] occupation on 6 December.{{sfn|DiNardo|2010|p=14}} With [[History of Poland (1918–39)|Polish independence]] restored in November 1918, the local population disarmed the [[Imperial German army|German army]].{{sfn|Biskupski|2012|p=28}} Subsequently, the textile industry of Łódź stalled and its population briefly decreased as ethnic Germans left the city.{{sfn|Berend|2013|p=195}}

===Restored Poland (1918–1939)===
[[File:Archiwum Włodzimierza Pfeiffera PL 39 596 328.png|thumb|{{lang|pl|Plac Wolności}} (Liberty Square) with the [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] Monument and Holy Spirit Church in 1930]]

Despite its large population and economic output, Łódź did not serve as the seat of its province until the 20th century.{{sfn|University of Łódź|1979|p=23}} Following the establishment of the [[Second Polish Republic]], it became the capital of the [[Łódź Voivodeship]] in 1919.{{sfn|Czerny|2006|p=57}} The early [[interwar period]] was characterised by considerable economic hardship and industrial stagnation.{{sfn|Roszkowski|2015|p=207}} The [[Great Depression]] and the [[German–Polish customs war]] closed western markets to Polish textiles while the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Bolshevik Revolution]] and the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] in Russia put an end to the most profitable trade with the East.{{sfn|Roszkowski|2015|p=207}}{{sfn|Czerny|2006|p=57}}

Because of rapid and, consequently, chaotic development in the previous century, Łódź did not possess the adequate infrastructure and living standards for its inhabitants.{{sfn|Feitelson|2017|p=118}} Pollution was acute, sanitary conditions were poor and the authorities did not invest in a [[sewage treatment]] system until the 1920s.{{sfn|Feitelson|2017|pp=118–119}}{{sfn|Karamouz|2021|p=386}} From 1918 to 1939, many cultural, educational and scientific institutions were created, including elementary schools, museums, art galleries and [[Public library|public libraries]] which prior to the First World War did not exist.{{sfn|Cudny|2016|pp=126–127}} Łódź also began developing an [[entertainment]] scene, with 34 movie theatres opened by 1939.{{sfn|Cudny|2016|pp=126–127}} On 13 September 1925, the city's first airport, [[Łódź Władysław Reymont Airport|Lublinek]], commenced operations.{{sfn|Badziak|Łapa|2009|p=160}} In 1930, the first [[radio]] transmission from a newly-founded broadcasting station took place.{{sfn|Wojalski|1992}}

The ideological orientation of Łódź was strongly [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] and the city was a notable centre of socialist, [[Communism|communist]] and [[Bundism|bundist]] activity in Polish politics during the interbellum.{{sfn|Brunell|2005|pp=179–180}}

===Second World War (1939–1945)===

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-133-0703-20, Polen, Ghetto Litzmannstadt, Brücke.jpg|thumb|right|[[Łódź Ghetto]] ({{lang|de|Ghetto Litzmannstadt}}), was the second-largest [[Nazi ghettos|ghetto]] in all of [[German-occupied Europe]].]]

During the [[invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, the Polish forces of General [[Juliusz Rómmel]]'s [[Łódź Army|Army Łódź]] defended the city against the German assault by forming a line of resistance between [[Sieradz]] and [[Piotrków Trybunalski]].{{sfn|Forczyk|2019|p=212}} The attack was conducted by the [[8th Army (Wehrmacht)|8th Army]] of [[Johannes Blaskowitz]], who encircled the city with the [[X Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|X Army Corps]].{{sfn|Forczyk|2019|p=260}} After fierce resistance, a Polish delegation surrendered to the Germans on 8 September, and the first {{lang|de|[[Wehrmacht]]|italic=no}} troops entered in the early hours of 9 September.{{sfn|Forczyk|2019|pp=260–261}} The German {{lang|de|[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe III]]}} paramilitary death squad entered the city on 12 September.{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009a|p=114}} [[Arthur Greiser]] incorporated Łódź into a new administrative subdivision of Nazi Germany called {{lang|de|[[Reichsgau Wartheland]]}} on 9 November 1939,{{sfn|Crowe|2021|p=168}} and on 11 April 1940 the city was renamed to {{lang|de|Litzmannstadt}} after German general and [[NSDAP]] member [[Karl Litzmann]].{{sfn|von Plato|Leh|Thonfeld|2010|p=87}}

The city became subjected to immediate [[Germanisation in Poland (1939–1945)|Germanisation]], with Polish and Jewish establishments closed, and [[Polish language|Polish-language]] press banned.{{sfn|von Plato|Leh|Thonfeld|2010|pp=87–88}} Low-wage [[forced labour]] was imposed on the city's inhabitants aged 16 to 60; many were subsequently deported to Germany.{{sfn|von Plato|Leh|Thonfeld|2010|p=88}} As part of the {{lang|de|[[Intelligenzaktion]]}}, Polish intellectuals from the city and region were imprisoned at [[Radogoszcz prison|Radogoszcz]] and then either sent to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] or murdered in the forests of Łagiewniki and the village of [[Lućmierz-Las]].{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009a|pp=203–205}} Polish children were [[kidnapping of ethnic Polish children by Nazi Germany|forcibly taken from their parents]],{{sfn|Ledniowski|Gola|2020|p=149}} and from 1942 to 1945 the German ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' operated a camp for kidnapped Polish children from various regions in Łódź.{{sfn|Ledniowski|Gola|2020|p=147}}

The German authorities established the [[Ghetto Litzmannstadt|Łódź Ghetto]] ({{lang|de|Ghetto Litzmannstadt}}) in the city and populated it with more than 200,000 Jews from the region, who were systematically sent to [[Nazi extermination camp|German extermination camps]].{{sfn|Trunk|Shapiro|2006|pp=XI, 9–13}} It was the second-largest ghetto in [[German-occupied Europe|occupied Europe]],{{sfn|Trunk|Shapiro|2006|p=XXXIII}} and the last major ghetto to be liquidated, in August 1944.{{sfn|Wieviorka|2006|pp=7–8}} The [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance movement]] ({{lang|pl|[[Żegota]]}}) operated in the city and aided the Jewish people throughout its existence.{{sfn|Datner|1968|p=69}} However, only 877 Jews were still alive by 1945.{{sfn|Trunk|Shapiro|2006|p=XI}} Of the 223,000 Jews in Łódź before the invasion, 10,000 survived [[the Holocaust]] in other places.{{sfn|Peck|1997}} The Germans also created camps for [[Gentile|non-Jews]], including the [[Romani people]] deported from abroad, who were ultimately [[Romani genocide|murdered]] at [[Chełmno extermination camp|Chełmno]],{{sfn|Trunk|Shapiro|2006|p=L}} as well as a penal [[forced labour under German rule during World War II|forced labour]] camp,{{sfn|Wardzyńska|2009b|p=30}} four transit camps for Poles [[expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|expelled]] from the city and region, and a [[racial policy of Nazi Germany|racial research]] camp.{{sfn|Ledniowski|Gola|2020|pp=148–149}}

===Post World War II (1945–1989)===

[[File:Retkinia, Łódź, Poland - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|[[Retkinia]], one of many post-war utilitarian residential areas on the outskirts of Łódź.]]
Following liberation by Soviet forces on 19 January 1945, and the end of the [[World War II]], Łódź informally and temporarily took over the functions of Poland's capital, and most of the government and country administration resided in the city prior to the reconstruction of [[Warsaw]].{{sfn|Cudny|Kunc|2021}}

Łódź also experienced an influx of refugees from [[Kresy]]. Many migrated into the suburbs and occupied the empty properties.{{sfn|Cudny|Kunc|2021}} Under the [[Polish People's Republic]], the city's industry and private companies were subject to [[nationalisation]].{{sfn|Cudny|Kunc|2021}} On 24 May 1945, the [[University of Łódź]] was inaugurated.{{sfn|Werra|Woźny|2018|p=481}} On 8 March 1948, the [[Łódź Film School|National Film School]] was opened, later becoming Poland's primary academy of drama and cinema.{{sfn|Dixon|2015|p=207}}

The spatial and [[urban planning]] after World War II was conducted in accordance with the [[Athens Charter]], where the population from the old core was relocated into new [[residential area]]s.{{sfn|Müller|2005|p=172}} However, as a result, the inner-city and historical areas fell in significance and degenerated into a [[slum]].{{sfn|Müller|2005|p=172}} A number of extensive [[panel building|panel]] block housing estates were constructed, including [[Retkinia]], Teofilów, Widzew, Radogoszcz, and Chojny. These block housing estates were constructed between 1960 and 1990, covering an area of almost {{convert|30|km2|sqmi}} and accommodating a large part of the populace.{{sfn|Kłysik|1998|p=175}}

In mid-1981 Łódź became famous for its massive [[summer 1981 hunger demonstrations in Poland|hunger demonstration of local mothers and their children]].<ref>{{cite book |title=The Polish Revolution: Solidarity |first=Timothy Garton |last=Ash |date=1 January 1999 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=0300095686 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/28/world/polish-minister-and-union-reach-compromise-on-meat-ration-cut.html?sec=health | title=Polish Minister and Union Reach Compromise on Meat Ration Cut | author1=James M.

===Contemporary history (1990–present)===
[[File:EC1, former power station, Łódź 2013 05.jpg|thumb|[[EC1 Science and Technology Center in Łódź|EC1 Science and Technology Center]]]]
After 1989 the [[textile industry]] in Łódź collapsed and the city suffered from social and economic decline. The city's [[industrial heritage]] and examples of [[Art Nouveau in Poland|Polish Art Nouveau]] became an early tourist attraction. In the 2000s the city's main street, the Piotrkowska Street, was revitalized, providing space for shops and restaurants. By 2011 the city hosted around 60 festivals per year.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Routledge Handbook of Tourism Cities | editor1=Alastair M. Morrison | editor2= J. Andres Coca-Stefaniak |publisher= Taylor & Francis |year=2020 |isbn=9780429534805 | pages=}}</ref>

The local government's efforts to transform the former industrial city into a thriving urban environment and tourist destination formed the basis for the city's failed bid to organise the 2022 International EXPO exhibition on the subject of urban renewal.<ref>[http://thenews.pl/1/12/Artykul/335369,Poland-to-invest-in-Lodz-despite-failed-bid-for-Expo-2022 "Poland to invest in Łódź despite failed bid for Expo 2022."] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180718234618/http://thenews.pl/1/12/Artykul/335369,Poland-to-invest-in-Lodz-despite-failed-bid-for-Expo-2022 |date=18 July 2018 }} ''Radio Poland''. 16 November 2017.

Łódź is the capital of [[Łódź Voivodeship]], one of Poland's 16 provinces, and hosts the [[voivodeship sejmik]] – a regional assembly.{{sfn|Badziak|Łapa|2009}}{{pn|date=September 2024}} The city is also the seat of the [[voivode]], the province's governor who is the representative of the [[Council of Ministers (Poland)|Polish Council of Ministers]] in the voivodeship, is the head of the combined government administration, acts as supervisory authority over local government units and as a higher-level authority within the meaning of the provisions on administrative proceedings.{{sfn|Badziak|Łapa|2009}}{{pn|date=September 2024}}

In medieval times, the town was governed by the [[burgomaster]], who began his term as early as 1470. The first individual who held the title of 
"president" was Karol Tangermann, a close aide of [[Rajmund Rembieliński]], when it was still a part of [[Congress Poland]].<ref name="Podolska">{{cite book |last1=Podolska |first1=Joanna |last2=Waingertner |first2=Przemysław |date=2008 |title=Prezydenci miasta Łodzi  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZA0sAQAAIAAJ&q=karol%20tangermann |location=Łódź |publisher=Tow.

===Administrative division===
Łódź was previously divided into 5 major boroughs (''[[dzielnica]]'') – Bałuty, Górna, Polesie, Śródmieście, and Widzew. In January 1993, the system of boroughs was abolished and the city became a single entity with no real subdivisions. In April 2000, a system of 36{{efn|List of the 36 units or neighbourhoods: Bałuty-Centrum, Bałuty-Doły, Bałuty Zachodnie, Julianów-Marysin-Rogi, Łagiewniki, Radogoszcz, Teofilów-Wielkopolska, Osiedle Wzniesień Łódzkich, Chojny, Chojny-Dąbrowa, Górniak, Nad Nerem, Piastów-Kurak, Rokicie, Ruda, Wiskitno, Osiedle im.

Historically, Łódź was multi-ethnic and its diverse population comprised migrants from other regions of [[Europe]]. In 1839, approximately 78 per cent (6,648) of the total population was [[Germans|German]]. In 1913, Łódź had a population of 506,100 people, of whom 251,700 (49.7%) were [[Polish people|Poles]], 171,900 (34%) were [[History of Jews in Poland|Jews]], 75,000 (14.8%) were Germans, and 6,300 (1.3%) were [[Russians]].{{Sfn|Kossert|2010|p=40}} According to the [[Polish census of 1931|1931 Polish census]], the total population of 604,000 included 375,000 (59%) Poles, 192,000 (32%) Jews and 54,000 (9%) Germans.

Historically, Łódź had a strong and influential [[Protestant]] population (11% in 1921, 9.2% in 1931) that had its origins with the migration of German-speaking weavers and textile workers throughout the 19th century.<ref name="Rzepkowski">{{cite journal |last1=Rzepkowski |first1=Arkadiusz |date=2008 |title=Skład narodowościowy, wyznaniowy i językowy ludności Łodzi w Drugiej Rzeczypospolitej |url=https://cejsh.icm.edu.pl/cejsh/element/bwmeta1.element.hdl_11089_19440/c/3-087_104-Rzepkowski.pdf |journal=Przegląd Nauk Historycznych |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=87–104 |access-date=15 August 2024 |lang=pl}}</ref> The [[Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland|Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession]] representing [[Lutherans]] is the largest of the Protestant denominations.

The only active Lutheran church in Łódź is the historic [[St. Matthew's Church, Łódź|St. Matthew's Church]], which seasonally serves as a concert hall. There is also a [[parish]] of the [[Polish Reformed Church]] ([[Reformed Christianity|Calvinist]]), dating back to 1888, as well as [[Methodism|Methodist]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] temples. Łódź is considered to be one of the centres of [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]' activity in Poland.

[[Judaism]] was once the city's second largest denomination (33.4% in 1931), with up to 250 [[synagogue]]s and [[shtiebel]]s in existence prior to 1939 and a strong cultural output.<ref name="Rzepkowski"/> The [[Stara Synagogue (Łódź)|Stara Synagogue]], commonly known as Alte Szil, and [[Ezras Israel Synagogue]] were the primary places of worship for [[Orthodox Jews]].

Before 1990, the economy of Łódź was heavily reliant on the [[textile|textile industry]], which had developed in the city in the nineteenth century owing to the abundance of rivers used to power the industry's fulling mills, bleaching plants and other machinery.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Kobojek |first1=Elżbieta |date=2017 |title=A Small River Within the Urban Space: the Evolution of the Relationship Using the Example of Łódź |journal=Space-Society-Economy |volume=19 |issue=19 |pages=7–20 |doi=10.18778/1733-3180.19.01 |url=http://repozytorium.uni.lodz.pl:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11089/22637/0_1_%5b7%5d-20_Kobojek.pdf |issn=1733-3180 |access-date=13 July 2018 |doi-access=free |archive-date=13 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713200410/http://repozytorium.uni.lodz.pl:8080/xmlui/bitstream/handle/11089/22637/0_1_%5b7%5d-20_Kobojek.pdf |url-status=live }} (p. 10).</ref> Because of the growth in this industry, the city has sometimes been called the "Polish [[Manchester]]"<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lamprecht |first1=Mariusz |date=2014 |title=Fluctuations in the Development of Cities.

By the time right before World War I Łódź had become one of the most densely populated industrial cities in the world, with 13,280 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, and also one of the most polluted. The textile industry declined dramatically in 1990 and 1991, and no major textile company survives in Łódź. However, countless small companies still provide a significant output of textiles, mostly for export. Łódź is no longer a significant industrial centre, but it has become a major hub for the business services sector in Poland owing to the availability of highly skilled workers and active cooperation between local universities and the business sector.<ref>{{cite report |date=2019 |title=Business Services Sector in Poland 2019 |url=https://absl.pl/storage/app/uploads/public/5d0/7a1/406/5d07a140668f0191663458.pdf |publisher=Association of Business Service Leaders (ABSL) |pages=28, 55 |access-date=11 January 2020 |archive-date=11 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200111132002/https://absl.pl/storage/app/uploads/public/5d0/7a1/406/5d07a140668f0191663458.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city benefits from its central location in Poland. A number of firms have located their logistics centres in the vicinity. Two motorways, [[A1 autostrada (Poland)|A1]] spanning from the north to the south of Poland, and [[A2 autostrada (Poland)|A2]] going from the east to the west, intersect northeast of the city. {{As of|2012|post=,}} the A2 is complete to Warsaw and the northern section of A1 is largely completed. With these connections, the advantages of the city's central location should increase even further. Work has also begun on upgrading the railway connection with Warsaw, which reduced the 2-hour travel time to make the {{convert|137|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} journey 1.5 hours in 2009. {{As of|2018|post=,}} travel time from Łódź to Warsaw is around 1.2 hours with the modern [[Pesa SA]] Dart trains.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pl.omio.com/pociagi/lodz/warszawa|title=Pociągi Łódź – Warszawa – Omio|website=www.pl.omio.com|access-date=14 February 2018|archive-date=6 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201106182710/https://pl.omio.com/pociagi/lodz/warszawa|url-status=live}}</ref>

The regional tramway network also connects Łódź with the adjacent cities of [[Pabianice]] (since 2023) and [[Konstantynów Łódzki]] (since 2024), which are within the Łódź Agglomeration. The rolling stock largely comprises older but modernised wagons by [[Konstal]] and newer Polish-manufactured types such as [[Pesa Swing]] and [[Moderus Gamma]]. Among the popular models for buses are Mercedes Conecto LF and [[Solaris Urbino 18]].

====Rail====
Łódź has a number of long distance and local railway stations. There are two main stations in the city, but with no direct rail connection between them—a legacy of 19th-century railway network planning. Originally constructed in 1866, the centrally-located [[Łódź Fabryczna]] was a [[terminus station]] for a branch line of the [[Warsaw-Vienna railway]],<ref>Grzegorczyk, p. 144.</ref> whereas [[Łódź Kaliska railway station|Łódź Kaliska]] was built more than thirty years later on the central section of the [[Warsaw-Kalisz Railway|Warsaw-Kalisz railway]]. For this reason most intercity train traffic goes to this day through Łódź Kaliska station, despite its relative distance from the city centre, and Łódź Fabryczna serves mainly as a terminal station for trains to [[Warsaw]]. The situation will be remedied in 2026 after the construction of a tunnel connecting the two,<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/lodz-tunel-srednicowy--kolejne-dwa-lata-opoznienia-117918.html |title= Łódź: Tunel średnicowy – kolejne dwa lata opóźnienia |access-date= 26 April 2024 |archive-date= 11 April 2024 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20240411125402/https://www.rynek-kolejowy.pl/wiadomosci/lodz-tunel-srednicowy--kolejne-dwa-lata-opoznienia-117918.html |url-status= live }}</ref> which is likely to make Łódź Poland's main railway hub.<ref name="dworzec">{{cite news |url=http://www.tvn24.pl/lodz,69/tak-bedzie-wygladalo-lodzkie-prawie-metro,696399.html |title=Superdworzec już jest, będzie (prawie) metro.

The third-largest train station in Łódź is [[Łódź Widzew railway station|Łódź Widzew]]. There are also many other stations and train stops in the city, many of which were upgraded as part of the [[Łódzka Kolej Aglomeracyjna]] commuter rail project. The rail service, founded as part of a major regional rail upgrade and owned by [[Łódź Voivodeship]], operates on routes to [[Kutno]], [[Sieradz]], [[Skierniewice]], [[Łowicz]], and on selected days to [[Warsaw]], with plans for further expansion after the construction of the tunnel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kurierkolejowy.eu/aktualnosci/29253/rekorodowy-rok-lodzkiej-kolei-aglomeracyjnej.html |title=Rekordowy rok Łódzkiej Kolei Aglomeracyjnej |date=22 December 2016 |access-date=3 August 2017 |website=kurierkolejowy.eu |archive-date=4 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804113106/https://kurierkolejowy.eu/aktualnosci/29253/rekorodowy-rok-lodzkiej-kolei-aglomeracyjnej.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|Education in Łódź}}
Łódź is a thriving center of academic life. Łódź hosts three major [[Public ownership|state-owned]] universities, six higher education establishments operating for more than a half of the century, and a number of smaller schools of higher education. The tertiary institutions with the most students in Łódź include:

*[[University of Łódź]] (''UŁ'' – {{lang|pl|Uniwersytet Łódzki}})
*[[Lodz University of Technology]] (''PŁ'' – {{lang|pl|Politechnika Łódzka}})
*[[Medical University of Łódź]] ({{lang|pl|Uniwersytet Medyczny w Łodzi}})
*[[National Film School in Łódź]] ({{lang|pl|Państwowa Wyższa Szkoła Filmowa, Telewizyjna i Teatralna w Łodzi}})
*[[Academy of Music in Łódź]] ({{lang|pl|Akademia Muzyczna im. Grażyny i Kiejstuta Bacewiczów w Łodzi}})
*[[Academy of Fine Arts In Łódź]] ({{lang|pl|Akademia Sztuk Pięknych im. Wł. Strzemińskiego w Łodzi}})

In the 2018 general ranking of state-owned tertiary education institutions in Poland, the University of Łódź came 20th (6th place among universities) and Lodz University of Technology 12th (6th place among technical universities). The Medical University of Łódź was ranked 5th among Polish medical universities. Leading courses taught in Łódź include administration (3rd place), law (4th) and biology (4th).

There is also a number of private-owned institutions of higher learning in Łódź. The largest of these are the University of Social Sciences ({{lang|pl|Społeczna Akademia Nauk}}) and the University of Humanities and Economics in Łódź ({{lang|pl|Akademia Humanistyczno-Ekonomiczna w Łodzi}}). In the 2018 ranking of private universities in Poland the former was ranked 9th, and the latter 23rd.

===National Film School in Łódź===
{{Main|National Film School in Łódź}}

The [[Leon Schiller]] National Higher School of Film, Television and Theatre in Łódź ({{lang|pl|Państwowa Wyższa Szkoła Filmowa, Telewizyjna i Teatralna im. Leona Schillera w Łodzi}}) is the most notable academy for future actors, directors, photographers, camera operators and TV staff in Poland. It was founded on 8 March 1948 and was initially planned to be moved to Warsaw as soon as the city was rebuilt following the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. However, in the end the school remained in Łódź and became one of the best-known institutions of higher education in the city.

At the end of the Second World War Łódź was the only large Polish city besides Kraków which war had not destroyed. The creation of the [[National Film School in Łódź|National Film School]] gave Łódź a role of greater importance from a cultural viewpoint, which before the war had belonged exclusively to Warsaw and Kraków. Early students of the School include the directors [[Andrzej Munk]], [[Roman Polanski]], [[Andrzej Wajda]], [[Kazimierz Karabasz]] (one of the founders of the so-called Black Series of Polish Documentary) and [[Janusz Morgenstern]], who at the end of the 1950s became famous as one of the founders of the [[Polish Film School]] of Cinematography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lodz.naszemiasto.pl/artykul/janusz-morgenstern-rezyser-m-in-stawki-wiekszej-niz-zycie,3181307,art,t,id,tm.html|title=Janusz Morgenstern, reżyser m.in.

The [[Jewish Cemetery, Łódź|Jewish Cemetery at Bracka Street]], one of the largest of its kind in Europe, was established in 1892. After the [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1939, this cemetery became a part of Łódź's ''eastern territory'' known as the enclosed Łódź ghetto (''Ghetto Field''). Between 1940 and 1944, approximately 43,000 burials took place within the grounds of this rounded-up cemetery.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishlodzcemetery.org/EN/AboutCemetery/AboutCemeteryAtBrackaStreet/Default.aspx|title=Jewish Lodz Cemetery – About Cemetery At Bracka Street|access-date=25 January 2017|archive-date=7 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107091938/http://www.jewishlodzcemetery.org/EN/AboutCemetery/AboutCemeteryAtBrackaStreet/Default.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1956, a monument by Muszko in memory of the victims of the [[Łódź Ghetto]] was erected at the cemetery.

Under [[communism]] it was common for [[sports club|clubs]] to participate in many different sports for all ages and sexes. Many of these traditional clubs still survive. Originally they were owned directly by a public body, but have become independently operated by clubs or private companies. However, they get public support through the cheap rent of land and other subsidies from the city. Some of their sections have gone professional and separated from the clubs as private companies. For example, Budowlani S.A is a private company that owns the only professional rugby team in Łódź, while Klub Sportowy Budowlani remains a community amateur club.
