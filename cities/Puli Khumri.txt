==History==
The capital of Baghlan province was officially transferred to the city of Puli Khumri from the central city of Baghlan. This transition occurred during the 1980s under the influence of [[Sayed Mansur Naderi]],  son of [[Sayed Kayan]], who held significant military and political power at the time.<ref>Author: Hakimi, Aziz Ahmed. Title: Fighting for Patronage: American counterinsurgency and the Afghan Local Police. Publisher: University of London. Date: 23.07.2015. Access date: 04.04.2024.</ref> The relocation aimed to enhance public access to administrative offices, leveraging Puli Khumri's strategic location along the Kabul-Mazar highway. The cabinet of [[Dr. Najibullah]], led by [[Sultan Ali Keshtmand]], initially proposed this move through declaration number 492 on March 1, 1989. It was subsequently formalized by Dr. Najibullah through decree number 1603 on March 9, 1989.<ref>Official Gadget of Ministry of Justice of Afghanistan Republic Government. (1989, July 6).
