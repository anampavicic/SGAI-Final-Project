'''Mango''' is a city and a [[neighbourhood]] of [[Jamshedpur]] city. It is situated across the [[Subarnarekha River]] and is connected to Jamshedpur via three bridges laid side by side. It is a huge and growing residential area. Once a less populated little town in the [[Dhalbhum subdivision]] of the [[East Singhbhum district]], it is now a booming neighbourhood and real estate hotbed.

Mango has the status of a 'city' according to the government through being part of the main city [[Jamshedpur]]. It is a notified area and is run by its own notified area committee, namely, Mango Notified Area Committee (MNAC). The electricity services are provided by the state-run electricity board, JBVNL(Jharkhand Bijli Vitran Nigam Limited).

Despite witnessing a drastic rise in infrastructure and housing projects, this area has been plagued with one of the highest crime rates in the city of Jamshedpur. Termed "the crime hub of Jamshedpur" by local news websites and journalists, this area has witnessed a significant rise in crime rates since the early noughties, Blocks like Ulidih, Azadnagar and Shankusai (Sankosai) being the centres of violent crimes including thefts, shootings and stabbings.

===Jamshedpur Urban Agglomeration=== 
With its recognition as an industrial town as early as the 1911 census, Jamshedpur was set on the road of steady population growth, as large number of emigrants flocked in for work opportunities. While in the earlier decades the central nucleus grew, in the later decades towns around Jamshedpur grew rapidly. In 2011, Jamshedpur Urban Agglomeration included 13 urban centres, with a total population of 1.3 million people. However, in more recent years, Jamshedpur UA “has lacked the growth and development observed around other similar industrial towns in western and southern India.”<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.l.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ahgis/files/3m/5-3.pdf |title = Growth of Industrial Cities in India: A Case Study of Jamshedpur | work= Amaresh Dubey|publisher= The Third Conference: GIS-based Global History from Asian Perspectives, 5 June 2015 | access-date = 25 December 2021}}</ref>
