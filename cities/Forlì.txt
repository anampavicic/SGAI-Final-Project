== Climate ==
The climate of the area is [[humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]) with [[Mediterranean]] features, fairly mitigated by the relative closeness of the city to the sea.

Forlì is characterized by hot and sunny summers, with temperatures that can exceed {{convert|30|C|F}} and even reach {{convert|40|C|F}} during the hottest weeks of the year.

Winters are cool and moist, with frequent fog. Occasionally the warm [[Sirocco]] wind blows from the south, bringing warmer temperatures for brief periods.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Forlì}}

=== Ancient era ===
The surroundings of Forlì have been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic]]: a site, Ca' Belvedere of [[Monte Poggiolo]], has revealed thousands of chipped flints in strata dated 800,000 years before the present era, which indicates a flint-knapping industry producing sharp-edged tools in a pre-[[Acheulean]] phase of the Paleolithic.

Forlì was founded after the Roman conquest of the remaining [[Gaul|Gallic]] villages, about the time the [[Via Aemilia]] was built. With no clear evidence, the exact date this occurred is still under debate, though some historians believe that the first settlement of the ancient Roman Forum was built in approximately 188 BC by consul [[Gaius Livius Salinator]] (the same that fought [[Hasdrubal Barca]] and vanquished him at the banks of the [[Metaurus River]] in 207 BC), who gave it the Latin name ''Forum Livii'', meaning "the place of the [[gens]] [[Livia gens|Livia]]". Others argue the town may have been founded later, during the time of [[Julius Caesar]].<ref name="history">{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.unibo.it/PortaleEn/Students/User+guide+to+Campus+Branches/User+Guide+to+Forli/historical_background.htm|title=Forlì and its historical background|access-date=26 February 2010}}</ref> In 88 BC, the city was destroyed during the civil wars of [[Gaius Marius]] and [[Sulla]], but later rebuilt by the praetor Livius Clodius.<ref name="newadvent">{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06137a.htm|title=Forlì|publisher=New Advent|access-date=26 February 2010}}</ref>

=== Middle Ages ===
After the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the city was incorporated into the realms of [[Odoacer]] and of the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]]. From the end of the 6th century to 751, Forlì was an outlying part of the [[Byzantine|Byzantine / Eastern Roman]] power in Italy known as the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]]. During this time the Germanic [[Lombards]] repeatedly took the city – in 665, 728, and 742. It was finally incorporated with the [[Papal States]] in 757, as part of the [[Donation of Pepin]].<ref name="newadvent" />

By the 9th century the commune had taken control from its bishops, and Forlì was established as an independent Italian city-state, alongside the other [[Medieval commune|communes]] that signalled the first revival of urban life in Italy. Forlì became a republic for the first time in 889. At this time the city was allied with the Ghibelline factions in the medieval struggles between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], partly as a means of preserving its independence – and the city supported all the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperors]] in their campaigns in Italy.<ref name="history" />

Local competition was involved in the loyalties: in 1241, during [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II's]] struggles with [[Pope Gregory IX]] the people of Forlì offered their support to Frederick II during the capture of the rival city, [[Faenza]], and in gratitude, they were granted an addition to their coat of arms – the [[Hohenstaufen]] eagle.<ref name="history" />

With the collapse of Hohenstaufen power in 1257, imperial lieutenant [[Guido I da Montefeltro]] was forced to take refuge in Forlì, the only remaining Ghibelline stronghold in Italy. He accepted the position of ''[[capitano del popolo]]'' ("Captain of the People") and led Forlì to notable victories: against the [[Bologna|Bolognesi]] at the Ponte di San Proculo, on 15 June 1275;<ref>''The Chronicle of [[Salimbene di Adam|Salimbene de Adam]]'', translated by Joseph L. Biard ([[Binghamton, New York|Binghamton]]: Center for Medieval and Early Renaissance Studies, 1986). Excerpted in {{cite web|url=http://www.deremilitari.org/RESOURCES/SOURCES/salimbene1.htm|title=Warfare between Bologna and Faenza (1275)|website=De Re Militari|access-date=6 November 2013}}</ref> against a Guelph allied force, including [[Florence|Florentine]] troops, at [[Civitella di Romagna|Civitella]] on 14 November 1276; and at Forlì itself against a powerful French contingent sent by [[Pope Martin IV]], on 15 May 1282, in a battle cited by [[Dante Alighieri]] (who was hosted in the city in 1303 by [[Scarpetta Ordelaffi]]), ''Inferno'' 27. In 1282, Forlì's forces were led by Guido da Montefeltro, while the French were under [[Jean d'Eppe]]. The [[astrology|astrologer]] [[Guido Bonatti]] (advisor of [[Emperor Frederick II]]) was one of his advisors.

The following year the city's exhausted Senate was forced to cede to papal power and asked Guido to take his leave. The commune soon submitted to a local ''[[condottiere]]'' rather than accept a representative of direct papal control, and [[Simone Mestaguerra]] had himself proclaimed ''Lord of Forlì''. He did not succeed in leaving the new signory peacefully to an heir, however, and Forlì passed to [[Maghinardo Pagano]], then to [[Uguccione della Faggiuola]] (1297), and to others, until in 1302 the [[Ordelaffi]] came into power.

Local factions with papal support ousted the family in 1327–29 and again in 1359–75, and at other turns of events the bishops were expelled by the Ordelaffi. Until the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] the Ordelaffi strived to maintain the possession of the city and its countryside, especially against Papal attempts to assert back their authority. Often civil wars between members of the family occurred. They also fought as [[condottieri]] for other states to earn themselves money to protect or embellish Forlì.
[[File:Porta schiavonia.JPG|thumb|220px|left|Porta Schiavonia]]

=== Modern age ===
The most renowned of the Ordelaffi was [[Pino III Ordelaffi|Pino III]], who held the Signiory of Forlì from 1466 to 1480. Pino was a ruthless lord; nevertheless he enriched the city with new walls and buildings and was a sponsor of the arts. When he died aged 40, under suspicion of poisoning, the situation of Forlì was weakened as factions of Ordelaffi fought one another, until [[Pope Sixtus IV]] claimed the signory for his nephew [[Girolamo Riario]]. Riario was married to [[Caterina Sforza]], the indomitable ''Lady of Forlì'' whose name is associated with the city's last independent history. Forlì was seized in 1488 by the [[Visconti of Milan|Visconti]] and in 1499 by [[Cesare Borgia]], after whose death it became more directly subject to the pope than ever before (apart from a short-lived return of the Ordelaffi in 1503–1504).<ref name="history" />
[[File:Paolo Monti - Servizio fotografico (Forlì, 1971) - BEIC 6357796.jpg|thumb|Church and convent of the Corpus Domini, photograph by [[Paolo Monti]], 1971. Fondo Paolo Monti, [[Biblioteca europea di informazione e cultura|BEIC]].]]

In June 1796, during the [[French Revolution]], [[Jacobin]] French troops entered the city – with [[Napoleon]] arriving on 4 February 1797. The French General recruited local officials and soldiers, resulting in political turmoil between 1820 and 1830, with risings in 1821 – including the revolutionary movement of the [[Carbonari]] in 1831 and 1848.<ref name="history" /> [[Napoléon Louis Bonaparte]], [[Napoleon]] I's nephew who was involved with the Carbonari, died there in 1831.

In the 19th century, Forlì was part of the [[Italian unification]] (or "the Risorgimento"), a political and social movement that agglomerated the different states of the [[Italian Peninsula]] into the single state of [[Italy]]. The citizens of Forlì were particularly inspired by military figure [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], who at this time was a commander. However, the city and its farmers had difficulty adapting to agrarian reform under the unification, thus lending rise to republican and socialist parties.<ref name="history" />

Forlì participated considerably during [[World War I]], resulting in it being awarded the "{{Interlanguage link|Fulcieri Paolucci De' Calboli|it|3=Fulcieri Paulucci di Calboli}}" gold medal. Afterwards in the 1920s, [[Benito Mussolini]] became actively involved in the local politics, before becoming dictator of Italy – a situation that remained for 20 years before the start of [[World War II]]. The war left the city with destroyed monuments and artistic losses, such as the {{Interlanguage link|San Biagio, Forlì|it|3=Chiesa di San Biagio (Forlì)|lt=Church of San Biagio}}, which included frescoes by [[Melozzo da Forlì]]. After the war, however, the city experienced a quick economic recovery, entering a new stage of democratic life.<ref name="history" />

== Economy ==
Forlì is a prosperous agricultural and industrial centre, with manufacture primarily focused on [[silk]], [[rayon]], clothing, machinery, metals, and household appliances. In the city also has seat the [[Ferretti Group]], one of the most famous producers of yachts.

== Main sights ==
[[File:Abbazia di San Mercuriale.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Abbey of San Mercuriale, Forlì|Abbey of San Mercuriale]]]]
Forlì is the location of various buildings of architectural, artistic and historical significance, that include frescoes as part of their decorations. At the heart of the city sits the [[Piazza Saffi|Piazza Aurelio Saffi]], which includes a statue of Italian politician [[Aurelio Saffi]] – who was an important figure in the radical republican current within the [[Italian unification|Risorgimento movement]], headed by [[Giuseppe Mazzini]] in the 19th century. The Piazza Saffi also includes the [[Abbey of San Mercuriale, Forlì|Abbey of San Mercuriale]] (named after [[Saint Mercurialis]], a bishop of the city who died in the 5th century), which is the main religious building in the city; and contains the famed Sepulchre of [[Barbara Manfredi]].{{sfn|Ashby|1911}} Also of note is the [[San Giacomo Apostolo, Forli|Dominican Church of San Giacomo Apostolo]]; better known as the Church of San Domenico – a late medieval church built in the 13th century in the southern part of the town.

Other medieval buildings include the Rocca di Ravaldino, a fortress enlarged in the 14th century by the [[Ordelaffi]] and [[Gil Álvarez Carrillo de Albornoz|Gil de Albornoz]], and later in the 15th century.

The city hosts the [[Palazzo Hercolani]], with decorations dating from the 19th century; containing the artwork ''La Beata Vergine del Fuoco con i Santi Mercuriale, Pellegrino, Marcolino e Valeriano'' by Italian painter {{Interlanguage link|Pompeo Randi|it}}. The {{Interlanguage link|Palazzo del Podestà, Forlì|it|3=Palazzo del Podestà (Forlì)|lt=Palazzo del Podestà}} is a civic building which was frescoed by [[Adolfo de Carolis]] in the 20th century.

Forlì has parks located in ''green'' areas, including the [[Parco della Resistenza in Forlì|Parco della Resistenza]] ("Resistance Park") city park, and the [[Parco Dragoni in Forlì|Parco di Via Dragoni]] – which provides performance facilities alongside standard amenities. The [[Teatro Diego Fabbri in Forlì|Teatro Diego Fabbri]] is a theatre which opened in September 2000.

=== Villafranca di Forlì ===
[[File:Immagine 10408e.jpg|thumb|right|Landing field in Villafranca di Forlì, with hamlet in the background]]
Villafranca di Forlì is a hamlet which a dependency of the municipality of Forlì, located on the north side of the main town, and spans over a territory sided on the west side by the [[Montone (river)|River Montone]]. The hamlet was the birthplace of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s mother, Rosa.<ref>{{cite book |title=My Father, Il Duce: A Memoir by Mussolini's Son |last=Mussolini |first=Romano |type=trans.
