'''Guri''' ({{Korean|hangul=구리|lit=Town of Nine Villages{{efn|The name was coined when 'Gu'ji-Myeon and Mangwu'ri'-Myeon were merged into Guri-Myeon in 1914.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}}}}}; {{IPA|ko|ku.ɾi}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi Province]], South Korea. It is located immediately to the east of [[Seoul]], in the heart of the [[Seoul Capital Area|Capital Metropolitan Area]].

The [[Royal Tombs of the Joseon Dynasty]] are located in the city. The hill of [[Achasan]] is also located here, site of the [[Baekje]]-era [[Achasanseong]] and numerous hiking trails. It also has pleasant walking paths along Wang-suk-cheon, a small creek separating Guri from [[Namyangju]]. The traditional town market in Doldari (Guri's downtown around what used to be a "stone bridge") provides a cheap alternative to department stores.

Guri first became a separate city in 1986.  Previously, it had been considered part of [[Yangju]] from antiquity until 1980, and part of [[Namyangju]] from 1980 to 1986. The name "Guri" was first used in 1914, at which time it was a ''[[Myeon (administrative division)|myeon]]'' in [[Yangju]]. Guri is connected to [[Seoul]] via two rail lines ([[Gyeongui–Jungang Line]] via [[Guri station]], [[Gyeongchun Line]] via [[Galmae station]]), as well as numerous city transit and intercity buses. In 2014, the extension of [[Seoul Subway Line 8]] began which will connect Guri to the [[Seoul Metro]] in October 2023.

== Location ==
It lies east-northern area of Gyeonggi province. The mountain of [[Achasan]] is to the west and the city of [[Namyangju]] to east.

The whole area is {{cvt|33.29|km2}}. In fact, Guri used to be bigger but some of the townships were incorporated into [[Seoul]] and other cities surrounding Guri.

== Topography ==
The Gwangju mountains are around the north-western area of Guri City. They are usually higher than 1000 meters, but to the exact west, there are lower hills.

Wamgsil Stream and the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] flow into city and it has about seventeen tributaries.

== Climate ==
Guri has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa''), but can be considered a borderline [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa'') using the {{convert|-3|C}} isotherm.
