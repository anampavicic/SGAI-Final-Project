'''Asella''' ({{langx|om|Asallaa|ʾÄsäla}}, {{langx|am|አሰላ}}) is a town in central [[Ethiopia]]. Located in the [[Arsi Zone]] of the [[Oromia|Oromia Region]] {{Convert|126|km|mi|abbr=unit}} south from [[Addis Ababa]], this town has a latitude and longitude of {{coord|7|57|N|39|7|E}}, with an elevation of 2,430 meters. Asella hosts an Asella Airport ([[IATA]] code ALK). Asalla was the capital of [[Arsi Province]] until that province was demoted to a Zone of Oromia with the adoption of the 1995 Constitution. It retains some administrative functions as the seat of the present Arsi Zone.

==History==
Asalla town got its start before the [[Second Italian-Abyssinian War]]. The Italian occupiers wanted to make Asela into a provincial capital, but they were unable to build more than one two-story building and some warehouses of masonry. The 6th brigade and two companies of the 5th brigade of the [[King's African Rifles]] captured Asella on 10 April 1941, after pursuing General [[Carlo De Simone|De Simone]] south from [[Dire Dawa]] and forcing their way past the [[Awash River]] and a dug-in Italian position. Brigade headquarters were afterwards set up in the town.<ref name=NAI-web>[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/A/ORTARG.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023043/http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/A/ORTARG.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }} (pdf) The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 7 December 2007)</ref>

In 1946, a Swedish Mission laid the foundations for a hospital and a school in Asella, which was ordered closed in 1966 when a government hospital was built. The town was subjected to a serious epidemic of dysentery during 1953, and a [[locust]] invasion in April 1961. In 1957, Asella was the southern end of the national telephone network, and by 1960, Asella had one of the ten municipal slaughter houses in Ethiopia; further, that year, a branch of the [[Ethiopian Electric Light and Power Authority]] had begun operation in the town.<ref name=NAI-web/>

Asella has been the home of many [[long-distance running|long-distance runners]], including [[Haile Gebrselassie]], [[Kenenisa Bekele]], [[Tirunesh Dibaba]], and [[Derartu Tulu]]. The Arsi University was established in Asella in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|title = History of Arsi University|url = http://www.arsiuniversity.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=90&Itemid=263|website = www.arsiuniversity.com|access-date = 2015-05-16}}</ref>
