It is among the fastest growing metropolitan regions in [[Southeast Asia]], both in population and economic development.

The city serves as the cultural, financial, tourism, political and economic centre of Malaysia. It is also home to the [[bicameral]] [[Parliament of Malaysia]] (consisting of the [[Dewan Rakyat]] and the [[Dewan Negara]]) and the [[Istana Negara, Jalan Tuanku Abdul Halim|Istana Negara]], the official residence of the [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] (monarch of Malaysia). Kuala Lumpur was first developed around 1857 as a town serving the [[tin mining|tin mines]] of the region, and important figures such as [[Yap Ah Loy]] and [[Frank Swettenham]] were instrumental in the early development of the city during the late 19th century. It served as the capital of [[Selangor]] from 1880 until 1978. Kuala Lumpur was the founding capital of the [[Federation of Malaya]] and its successor, Malaysia. The city remained the seat of the executive and judicial branches of the [[Malaysian federal government]] until these were relocated to [[Putrajaya]] in early 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.my/MyGov/BI/Directory/Government/AboutMsianGov/PutrajayaFederalAdminCapital/|title=Putrajaya&nbsp;– Administrative Capital of Malaysia|publisher=Government of Malaysia|access-date=11 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021194523/http://www.gov.my/MyGov/BI/Directory/Government/AboutMsianGov/PutrajayaFederalAdminCapital/|archive-date=21 October 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, some sections of the political bodies still remain in Kuala Lumpur.

Since the 1990s, the city has played host to many international sporting, political and cultural events, including the [[1998 Commonwealth Games]], [[2001 Southeast Asian Games]], [[2017 Southeast Asian Games]], [[Formula One]], [[Moto GP]] and [[FIFA Youth Championship|FIFA World Youth Championships]]. Kuala Lumpur has undergone rapid development in recent decades and is home to the [[List of tallest twin buildings and structures in the world|tallest twin buildings]] in the world, the [[Petronas Towers]] which have since become an iconic symbol of Malaysian development. Kuala Lumpur is well connected with neighboring urban metro regions such as [[Petaling Jaya]] via the rapidly expanding [[Klang Valley Integrated Transit System]]. Residents of the city can also travel to other parts of [[Peninsular Malaysia]] as well as to [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA) via rail through [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral station|KL Sentral]].

It has also been proposed that Kuala Lumpur was originally named Pengkalan Lumpur ("muddy landing place") in the same way that [[Klang (city)|Klang]] was once called Pengkalan Batu ("stone landing place"), but became corrupted into Kuala Lumpur.<ref name="sutanpuasa" /> Another theory says that it was initially a [[Cantonese]] word ''lam-pa'', meaning 'flooded jungle' or 'decayed jungle'. There is no firm contemporary evidence for these suggestions other than anecdotes.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Story of Kuala Lumpur, 1857–1939|author=J.M.

The buildings were constructed of wood and [[Attap dwelling|atap]] before regulations enacted by Swettenham in 1884 required buildings to use bricks and tiles. The appearance of Kuala Lumpur transformed rapidly in the following years due to the building regulations.]]
Early Kuala Lumpur was a small town that suffered from many social and political problems – the buildings were made of wood and '[[Nypa fruticans|atap]]' (palm frond [[thatching]]). The buildings were prone to catching fire, and due to a lack of proper sanitation the town was plagued with diseases. It also suffered from a constant threat of flooding due to its location. The town became embroiled in the [[Selangor Civil War]] in part over control of revenue from the tin mines. Yap Ah Loy allied himself with {{ILL|Tengku Kudin|ms}} and the [[Hai San Secret Society|Hai San]] secret society, they fought against a rival secret society, [[Ghee Hin Kongsi|Ghee Hin]], whom allied themselves with Raja Mahdi.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Baker |first=Jim |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRaJAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA125 |title=Crossroads (2nd Edn): A Popular History of Malaysia and Singapore |date=2008-07-15 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish International Asia Pte Ltd |isbn=978-981-4435-48-2 |pages=124 |language=en}}</ref> Raja Asal and Sutan Puasa switched sides to Raja Mahdi, and Kuala Lumpur was captured in 1872 and burnt to the ground.

A major outbreak of [[cholera]] caused many to flee. The slump lasted until late 1879, when rising prices for tin allowed the town to recover.<ref name=ooi/> In late 1881, the town was severely flooded, after a fire that had destroyed the entire town in January.

This system of appointing the mayor has been in place ever since the local government elections were suspended in 1970.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.citymayors.com/government/malaysia_government.html|title=Malaysia's towns and cities are governed by appointed mayors|year=2006|publisher=City Mayors|access-date=9 October 2006|archive-date=14 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514203410/http://www.citymayors.com/government/malaysia_government.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Historically Kuala Lumpur was a predominantly Chinese city, although more recently the [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|Bumiputera]] component of the city has grown substantially and they are now the dominant group. The Kuala Lumpur of 1872 beside the Klang River was described by Frank Swettenham as a "purely Chinese village", although a Malay [[stockade]] already existed at [[Bukit Nanas]] at that time.<ref name="gulllick 3"/> By 1875, after participation in the [[Selangor Civil War]] by Pahang Malays had ended, Swettenham noted Malay quarters near the Chinese area in a sketch map he had drawn. There were said to be 1,000 Chinese and 700 Malays in the town in this period. Many of the Malays may have settled in Kuala Lumpur after the war.<ref name="gulllick 3"/> The population of Kuala Lumpur had increased to around three thousand in 1880 when it was made the capital of Selangor.<ref name="population"/> A significant component of the Malay population in Kuala Lumpur of this period consisted of Malays recruited by the British in 1880, mostly from rural [[Malacca]], to establish a police force of 2–300, many of whom brought their families.{{sfn|Gullick|2000|page=43}} Many of the Malays were originally from the other islands of [[Malay Archipelago]] i.e. Sumatra and Java. The [[Mandailing people|Mandailings]], the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabaus]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], and [[Bugis people|Buginese]] began arriving in Kuala Lumpur in the 19th century, while the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] arrived in the late 20th century.<ref>Antje Missbach, Separatist Conflict in Indonesia: The Long-distance Politics of the Acehnese Diaspora, 2011</ref> In the following decades that saw the rebuilding of the town, it grew considerably with a large influx of immigrants, due in large part to the construction of a railway line in 1886 connecting Kuala Lumpur and [[Klang (city)|Klang]].<ref name=ooi>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&pg=PA746 |title=Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East Timor, Volume 1 |editor=Keat Gin Ooi |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-57607-770-2 |access-date=2 September 2017 |archive-date=4 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804044917/https://books.google.com/books?id=QKgraWbb7yoC&pg=PA746 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Independence coupled with rapid economic growth from the 1970s to the 1990s and with Islam being the official religion in the country, has resulted in the construction of buildings with a more local and Islamic flavour arise around the city. Many of these buildings derive their design from traditional Malay items such as the [[songkok]] and the [[Kris|keris]]. Some of these buildings have Islamic geometric motifs integrated into the designs of the building, due to Islamic restrictions on imitating nature through drawings.<ref name="Cop149">{{cite book|title=World Architecture: An Illustrated History|author=Copplestone, Trewin|page=[https://archive.org/details/worldarchitectur00copp/page/149 149]|publisher=London, Hamlyn|year=1976|isbn=978-0-600-03954-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/worldarchitectur00copp/page/149}}</ref> Examples of these buildings are [[Telekom Tower]], [[Maybank Tower (Kuala Lumpur)|Maybank Tower]], [[Dayabumi Complex]], and the Islamic Centre.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0cqkU5RxwgC&pg=PA71|title=Malaysia, Modernity and the Multimedia Super Corridor: A Critical Geography, page 74|access-date=14 December 2007|isbn=978-0-203-64736-3|date=12 March 2004|last1=Bunnell|first1=Tim|publisher=Taylor & Francis }}</ref> Some buildings such as the Islamic Arts Museum Malaysia and [[Planetarium Negara|National Planetarium]] have been built to masquerade as a place of worship, complete with [[dome]] and [[minaret]], when in fact they are places of science and knowledge.

Late modern and postmodern architecture began to appear in the late-1990s and early-2000s. With economic development, old buildings such as [[Bok House]] have been razed to make way for new ones. Buildings with all-glass shells exist throughout the city, with the most prominent examples being the [[Petronas Towers]] and [[Kuala Lumpur Convention Centre]]. Kuala Lumpur's central business district today has shifted to the Kuala Lumpur city centre (KLCC) where many new and tall buildings with modern and postmodern architecture fill the skyline.

The [[KTM Komuter]], a [[commuter rail]] service, was introduced in 1995 as the first rail transit system to provide local rail services in Kuala Lumpur and the surrounding [[Klang Valley]] suburban areas. Services were later expanded to other parts of Malaysia with the introduction of the [[KTM Komuter Northern Sector|Northern]] and Southern sectors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=49|title=Intercity services|publisher=Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad|access-date=19 December 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214084449/http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=49|archive-date=14 December 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> KTM Komuter's 175&nbsp;km (109&nbsp;mi) network in the Central Sector has 53 stations.

Transfers between the two main lines can be made at any of the four stations on the central core: [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral|KL Sentral]], [[Kuala Lumpur Railway Station|Kuala Lumpur]], [[Bank Negara Komuter station|Bank Negara]] and [[Putra Komuter station|Putra]].

Light Rapid Transit (LRT) Malaysia is the [[medium-capacity rail system|medium-capacity rail]] lines in the [[Klang Valley]], [[Malaysia]]. The first LRT line was opened in 1996 and the system has since expanded to three lines, which opened in 1998 and 1999. Along with the MRT, the LRT is constructed and owned by the Prasarana, with operating concessions currently run by Rapid KL and Rapid Rail.

Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) Malaysia is a heavy rail rapid transit system that constitutes the bulk of the railway network in Kuala Lumpur and the rest of the [[Klang Valley]]. The first section of the MRT opened on 16 December 2016, and the network has since grown rapidly in accordance with Malaysia's aim of developing a comprehensive rail network as the backbone of the country's public transportation system. The network consists of three lines – the {{Rint|my|13}} [[MRT Circle Line]], looping around Kuala Lumpur, the {{Rint|my|9}} [[MRT Kajang Line]] and the {{Rint|my|12}} [[MRT Putrajaya Line]], covering a 20&nbsp;km radius in the southeast–northwest direction from the city centre, will integrate the current [[rapid transit]] system and serve high-density areas which are currently not serviced by any rapid transit system. About 90 new stations are planned in this "wheel and spoke" concept, out of which 26 in the city centre will be underground. Ridership capacity will be two million passengers per day.<ref>{{cite news| title=KL to get landmark MRT in world-class city bid| url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/kl-to-get-landmark-mrt-in-world-class-city-bid/| publisher=The Malaysian Insider| date=10 June 2010| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619041035/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/kl-to-get-landmark-mrt-in-world-class-city-bid/| archive-date=19 June 2010}}</ref>

Kuala Lumpur is served by two airports. The main airport, [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA) at Sepang, Selangor, which is also the aviation hub of Malaysia, is located about {{convert|50|km}} south of city. The other airport is [[Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport]], also known as Subang Skypark and served as the main international gateway to Kuala Lumpur from 1965 until KLIA opened in 1998.

KLIA connects the city with direct flights to destinations on four continents around the world,<ref>{{cite press release|publisher=National Geographic|url=http://www.ngcasia.com/press/megacities.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206130643/http://www.ngcasia.com/press/megacities.aspx|archive-date=6 February 2008|title=Malaysia Airlines Takes Flight to MEGACITIES on National Geographic Channel|access-date=19 December 2007}}</ref> and is the main hub for the national carrier, [[Malaysia Airlines]] and low-cost carrier, [[AirAsia]].

Direct buses from KLIA to the city centre are plentiful (every 10 to 15 minutes during peak hours), air-conditioned and comfortable with fares ranging from RM 11 (roughly US$2.70) to RM 15 (roughly US$3.70). Air Asia and other low-cost carrier flights do not fly out of KLIA main terminal, but from [[KLIA2]], which is two kilometres from KLIA. KLIA2 is served by an extension of the KLIA Ekspres and by a free shuttle bus service from KLIA. {{as of|2018}}, Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport is only used for chartered and turboprop flights by airlines such as [[Firefly (airline)|Firefly]] and [[Malindo Air]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.asianewsdesk.com/2007/11/27/subang-only-for-turbo-props/ |title=Subang only for turbo-props |publisher=Asian News Desk |date=27 November 2007 |access-date=13 December 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071218141156/http://www.asianewsdesk.com/2007/11/27/subang-only-for-turbo-props/ |archive-date=18 December 2007 }}</ref>

''Bas Mini KL'' or Kuala Lumpur Mini-Bus Service was one of the oldest and popular [[Malaysia]] [[public transportation|public bus service]], having served Kuala Lumpur and the [[Klang Valley]] region. The buses were primarily painted pink with a white stripe on the sides, and had a capacity of only 20–30 passengers, due to their smaller size. The buses operated on a commission basis, with service operators paid according to the fares they collected. The mini-bus service was from 23 September 1975 and discontinued on 1 July 1998, to be replaced by the Intrakota bus service and later, [[Rapid Bus]] in 2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nst.com.my/news/2016/12/198929/bas-mini-yesteryear|title=The 'bas mini' of yesteryear|author=B.

Rapid Bus began the first phase of the revamp of its bus network in January 2006, introducing 15 City Shuttle bus routes which serve major areas in the Central Business District (CBD) of Kuala Lumpur. In 2008, Rapid Bus operated 167 routes with 1,400 buses covering 980 residential areas with a ridership of about 400,000 per day.<ref>{{cite news|title=RM4.9b to boost urban,rail transport systems | url=http://www.theedgedaily.com/cms/contentPrint.jsp?id=com.tms.cms.article.Article_c810b93f-cb73c03a-c8c7d600-360bce9e&paging=0 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402112032/http://www.theedgedaily.com/cms/contentPrint.jsp?id=com.tms.cms.article.Article_c810b93f-cb73c03a-c8c7d600-360bce9e&paging=0 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2 April 2015 | author = Surin Murugiah | date= 27 June 2008| access-date=28 June 2008}}</ref> The buses run between four hubs at the edge of the central business district, namely [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral station|KL Sentral]], [[Titiwangsa]], [[Kuala Lumpur City Centre]], [[Maluri station|Maluri]], and [[Medan Pasar bus hub|Medan Pasar]] in the city centre.
