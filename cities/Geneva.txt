The city was mentioned in [[Latin]] texts, by [[Commentarii de Bello Gallico|Caesar]], with the spelling ''Genava'',<ref>Hans-Friedrich Mueller, ''Caesar Selections from His Commentarii De Bello Gallico'', Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers, 2012, p. 34.</ref> probably from the [[Continental Celtic|Celtic]] {{lang|cel|*genawa-}} from the stem {{lang|cel|*genu-}} ("mouth"), in the sense of an [[estuary]], an etymology shared with the Italian port city of [[Genoa]] (in Italian ''Genova'').<ref name="celtic">John T. Koch, ''Celtic culture: a historical encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 2006, p. 1513.</ref><ref>Delamarre, Xavier, ''Dictionnaire de la langue gauloise'', Paris, 2003, p. 177</ref>

The medieval [[county of Geneva]] in [[Middle Latin]] was known as ''pagus major Genevensis'' or ''Comitatus Genevensis'' (also ''Gebennensis''). After 1400 it became the ''[[Genevois (province)|Genevois]]'' province of [[Savoy]] (albeit not extending to the city proper, until the [[John Calvin|reformation]] of the seat of the [[Bishop of Geneva]]).<ref>Pour cette citation et le découpage suivant, organisation décrite par l'ouvrage Jules-Joseph Vernier, ''Étude historique et géographique sur la Savoie'', Le Livre d'Histoire – Res Universis (réimpr. 1993) (1re éd. 1896), p. 137.</ref>

[[File:DV307 no.80 From Vile Rousean, Geneva Aug 4 1858.png|thumb|left|A view of Geneva by [[Frances Elizabeth Wynne]], 4 August 1858]]

Geneva was an [[Allobroges|Allobrogian]] border town, fortified against the [[Helvetii]] tribe,<ref name="CathEncy-LausanneGeneva">{{Catholic|wstitle=Lausanne and Geneva|inline=yes}}</ref> when the [[Roman Republic]] took it in 121 BC. It [[Christianization of the Roman Empire|became Christian]] under the Late [[History of the Roman Empire|Roman Empire]], and acquired its first [[bishop of Geneva|bishop]] in the 5th century, having been connected to the [[Bishopric of Vienne]] in the 4th.

[[File:ETH-BIB-Genf = Genève-LBS H1-026493.tif|thumb|Aerial view (1966)]]
In the [[Middle Ages]], Geneva was ruled by a [[county of Geneva|count]] under the [[Holy Roman Empire]] until the late 14th century, when it was granted a charter giving it a high degree of self-governance. Around this time, the [[House of Savoy]] came to at least nominally dominate the city. In the 15th century, an [[Oligarchy|oligarchic]] republican government emerged with the creation of the [[Grand Council of Geneva|Grand Council]]. In the first half of the 16th century, the [[Protestant Reformation]] reached the city, causing religious strife, during which Savoy rule was thrown off and Geneva allied itself with the [[Old Swiss Confederacy|Swiss Confederacy]].
In 1541, with Protestantism on the rise, [[John Calvin]], the [[Protestant]] [[Reformation|Reformer]] and proponent of [[Calvinism]], became the spiritual leader of the city and established the [[Republic of Geneva]]. By the 18th century, Geneva had come under the influence of [[Catholicism|Catholic]] France, which cultivated the city as its own. France tended to be at odds with the ordinary townsfolk, which inspired the failed [[Geneva Revolution of 1782]], an attempt to win representation in the government for men of modest means. In 1798, revolutionary France under the [[French Directory|Directory]] annexed Geneva. At the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], on 1{{spaces}}June 1814, Geneva was admitted to the [[Swiss Confederation]]. In 1907, the separation of Church and State was adopted. Geneva flourished in the 19th and 20th centuries, becoming the seat of many international organizations.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=Geneva |url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552135/Geneva_(Switzerland).html#s3 |encyclopedia=[[Encarta]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029012940/http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761552135/Geneva_%28Switzerland%29.html#s3 |archive-date=29 October 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The city covers an area of {{cvt|15.93|km2|sqmi|1}}, while the area of the [[Canton of Geneva|canton]] is {{cvt|282|km2|sqmi|1}}, including the two small [[enclave|exclave]]s of [[Céligny]] in [[Vaud]]. The part of the lake that is attached to Geneva has an area of {{cvt|38|km2|sqmi|1}} and is sometimes referred to as ''petit lac'' (small lake). The canton has only a {{cvt|4.5|km|mi|1|adj=mid|-long}} border with the rest of Switzerland. Of {{cvt|107.5|km|mi|1}} of the border, 103 are shared with France, the [[Ain|Département de l'Ain]] to the north and west and the [[Haute-Savoie|Département de la Haute-Savoie]] to the south and east.

Of the land in the city, {{cvt|0.24|km2|sqmi}}, or 1.5%, is used for agricultural purposes, while {{cvt|0.5|km2|sqmi}}, or 3.1%, is forested. The rest of the land, {{cvt|14.63|km2|sqmi}}, or 91.8%, is built up (buildings or roads), {{cvt|0.49|km2|sqmi}}, or 3.1%, is either rivers or lakes and {{cvt|0.02|km2|acre}}, or 0.1%, is wasteland.<ref name="BFS_land">[http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/02/03/blank/data/gemeindedaten.html Swiss Federal Statistical Office-Land Use Statistics] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160606115802/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/02/03/blank/data/gemeindedaten.html |date=6 June 2016 }} 2009 data {{in lang|de}} accessed 25 March 2010.</ref>

Of the built-up area, industrial buildings made up 3.4%, housing and buildings made up 46.2% and transportation infrastructure 25.8%, while parks, green belts and sports fields made up 15.7%. Of the agricultural land, 0.3% is used for growing crops. Of the water in the municipality, 0.2% is composed of lakes and 2.9% is rivers and streams.<ref name=BFS_land/>

The altitude of Geneva is {{cvt|373.6|m|ft|1}} and corresponds to the altitude of the largest of the [[Pierres du Niton]], two large rocks emerging from the lake which date from the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last ice age]]. This rock was chosen by General [[Guillaume Henri Dufour]] as the reference point for surveying in Switzerland.<ref>[[Swisstopo]], [http://www.swisstopo.ch/en/basics/geo/faq/horizon Height reference for Switzerland].

The climate of Geneva is a [[temperate climate]], more specifically an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Cfb'''). Winters are cool, usually with light frosts at night and thawing conditions during the day. Summers are relatively warm. Precipitation is adequate and is relatively well-distributed throughout the year, although autumn is slightly wetter than other seasons. Ice storms near [[Lac Léman]] are normal in the winter: Geneva can be affected by the [[Bise]], a north-easterly wind. This can lead to severe icing in winter.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.rts.ch/info/suisse/8314926-la-bise-va-se-calmer-apres-une-journee-chaotique-mais-plusieurs-ecoles-vont-rester-fermees.html |title=La bise va se calmer après une journée chaotique, mais plusieurs écoles vont rester fermées |publisher=[[Radio Télévision Suisse|RTS Radio Télévision Suisse]] |date=17 January 2017 |location=Geneva |language=fr |access-date=25 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225210514/https://www.rts.ch/info/suisse/8314926-la-bise-va-se-calmer-apres-une-journee-chaotique-mais-plusieurs-ecoles-vont-rester-fermees.html |archive-date=25 February 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In summer, many people swim in the lake and patronise public beaches such as Genève Plage and the [[Bains des Pâquis]]. The city, in certain years, receives snow during colder months. The nearby mountains are subject to substantial snowfall and are suitable for skiing. Many world-renowned ski resorts such as [[Verbier]] and [[Crans-Montana]] are less than three hours away by car. [[Saleve|Mont Salève]] ({{cvt|1379|m|ft}}), just across the border in France, dominates the southerly view from the city centre, and [[Mont Blanc]], the highest of the Alpine range, is visible from most of the city, towering high above [[Chamonix]], which, along with Morzine, Le Grand Bornand, La Clusaz, and resorts of the Grand Massif such as Samoens, Morillon, and Flaine, are the closest French skiing destinations to Geneva.

During the years 2000–2009, the mean yearly temperature was 11&nbsp;°C and the mean number of sunshine-hours per year was 2003.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Geneva climate: average weather, temperature, precipitation, best time |url=https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/switzerland/geneva |access-date=16 June 2020 |website=www.climatestotravel.com |archive-date=31 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731224525/https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/switzerland/geneva |url-status=live}}</ref>

The highest temperature recorded in Genève–Cointrin was {{cvt|39.7|C|F}} in July 2015, and the lowest temperature recorded was −20.0&nbsp;°C (−4.0&nbsp;°F) in February 1956.

===Administrative divisions===

The city is divided into eight ''quartiers'', or districts, sometimes composed of several neighbourhoods. On the left bank are: (1) Jonction, (2) Centre, [[Plainpalais]], and Acacias; (3) Eaux-Vives; and (4) [[Champel]]. The right bank includes: (1) Saint-Jean and Charmilles; (2) [[Servette]] and Petit-Saconnex; (3) Grottes and Saint-Gervais; and (4) Paquis and Nations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Districts of Geneva |publisher=Official website of Geneva |url=http://www.ville-ge.ch/en/quartiers/index.htm |access-date=9 February 2008 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080113111654/http://www.ville-ge.ch/en/quartiers/index.htm |archive-date = 13 January 2008}}</ref>

===Government===
{{see also|List of mayors of Geneva}}

The Administrative Council ('''Conseil administratif''') constitutes the executive government of the city of Geneva and operates as a collegiate authority. It is composed of five councilors ({{langx|fr|link=no|Conseiller administratif/ Conseillère administrative}}), each presiding over a department. The president of the executive department acts as mayor (''la maire/le maire''). In the governmental year 2021–2022, the Administrative Council is presided over by ''Madame la maire de Genève'' [[Frédérique Perler]]. Departmental tasks, coordination measures and implementation of laws decreed by the Municipal Council are carried out by the Administrative Council. Elections for the Administrative Council are held every five years. The current term of (''la législature'') is from 1{{spaces}}June 2020 to 31{{spaces}}May 2025. The delegates are elected by means of a system of Majorz. The mayor and vice change each year, while the heads of the other departments are assigned by the collegiate. The executive body holds its meetings in the Palais Eynard, near the Parc des Bastions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ville-geneve.ch/conseil-administratif/ |title=Le Conseil administratif 2015–2020 |publisher=Ville de Genève |type=official site |date=2 June 2015 |language=fr |location=Geneva, Switzerland |access-date=29 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709005356/http://www.ville-geneve.ch/conseil-administratif/ |archive-date=9 July 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

{{As of|2020}}, Geneva's Administrative Council is made up of two representatives each of the [[Social Democratic Party of Switzerland|Social Democratic Party]] (PS) and the [[Green Party of Switzerland|Green Party]] (PES), and one member of the [[Christian Democratic People's Party of Switzerland|Christian Democratic Party]] (PDC). This gives the left-wing parties four out of the five seats and, for the first time in history, a female majority.

The Municipal Council ('''Conseil municipal''') holds [[legislative power]]. It is made up of 80 members, with elections held every five years. The Municipal Council makes regulations and by-laws that are executed by the Administrative Council and the administration. The delegates are selected by means of a system of [[proportional representation]] with a seven percent threshold.
The sessions of the Municipal Council are public. Unlike members of the Administrative Council, members of the Municipal Council are not politicians by profession, and they are paid a fee based on their attendance. Any resident of Geneva allowed to vote can be elected as a member of the Municipal Council. The Council holds its meetings in the Town Hall (''Hôtel de Ville''), in the old city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ville-geneve.ch/conseil-municipal/ |title=Conseil municipal |publisher=Ville de Genève |type=official site |date=3 June 2015 |location=Geneva, Switzerland |language=fr |access-date=30 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160126003508/https://www.ville-geneve.ch/conseil-municipal/ |archive-date=26 January 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The last election of the Municipal Council was held on 15{{spaces}}March 2020 for the (''législature'') of 2020–2025.

===Metropolitan cooperation===
The city centre of Geneva is located only {{convert|1.9|km|mi|1|abbr=on}} from the border of [[France]]. As a result, the [[urban area]] and the [[metropolitan area]] largely extend across the border on French territory. Due to the small size of the municipality of Geneva ({{convert|16|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}})<ref name=land_area /> and extension of the urban area over an international border, official bodies of transnational cooperation were developed as early as the 1970s to manage the cross-border Greater Geneva area at a metropolitan level.

In 1973, a Franco-Swiss agreement created the ''Comité régional franco-genevois'' ("Franco-Genevan Regional Committee", CRFG in French). In 1997 an 'Urban planning charter' of the CRFG defined for the first time a planning territory called ''agglomération franco-valdo-genevoise'' ("Franco-[[Vaud]]-Genevan urban area"). 2001 saw the creation of a ''Comité stratégique de développement des transports publics régionaux'' ("Strategic Committee for the Development of Regional Public Transports", DTPR in French), a committee which adopted in 2003 a 'Charter for Public Transports', first step in the development of a metropolitan, cross-border [[commuter rail]] network (see [[Léman Express]]).

In 2004, a public transnational body called ''Projet d’agglomération franco-valdo-genevois'' ("Franco-Vaud-Genevan urban area project") was created to serve as the main body of metropolitan cooperation for the planning territory defined in 1997, with more local French councils taking part in this new public body than in the CRFG created in 1973. Finally in 2012 the ''Projet d’agglomération franco-valdo-genevois'' was renamed ''[[Grand Genève]]'' ("Greater Geneva"), and the following year it was transformed into a {{Interlanguage link|Local Grouping of Transnational Cooperation|fr|Groupement local de coopération transfrontalière}} (GLCT in French), a public entity under Swiss law, which now serves as the executive body of the ''Grand Genève''.

The ''Grand Genève'' GLCT is made up of the [[Canton of Geneva]], the [[Nyon District]] (in the canton of Vaud), and the {{Interlanguage link|''Pôle métropolitain du Genevois français''|fr|Pôle métropolitain du Genevois français}} (literally "Metropolitan hub of the French Genevan territory"), this last one a federation of eight French [[Communes of France#Intercommunality|intercommunal]] councils in [[Ain]] and [[Haute-Savoie]]. The ''Grand Genève'' GLCT extends over {{convert|1996|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}<ref name=GLCT_land_area />
and had a population of 1,046,168 in Jan. 2021 (Swiss estimates and French census), 58.3% of them living on Swiss territory, and 41.7% on French territory.<ref name=GLCT_pop />

===International relations===
Geneva does not have any [[Sister city|sister]] relationships with other cities.

The city of Geneva (''ville de Genève'') had a population 203,856 in 2021 (Jan. estimate)<ref name=population /> within its small municipal territory of {{convert|16|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=land_area /> The city of Geneva is at the centre of the Geneva [[metropolitan area]], a [[Functional Urban Area]] (as per [[Eurostat]] methodology) which extends over Swiss territory (entire [[Canton of Geneva]] and part of the canton of [[Vaud]]) and French territory (parts of the [[Departments of France|departments]] of [[Ain]] and [[Haute-Savoie]]).<ref name=FUA /> The Geneva Functional Urban Area covers a land area of {{convert|2292|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} (24.2% in Switzerland, 75.8% in France)<ref name=FUA_land_area /> and had 1,053,436 inhabitants in Jan. 2021 (Swiss estimates and French census), 57.8% of them on Swiss territory and 42.2% on French territory.<ref name=FUA_pop />

The Geneva metropolitan area is one of the fastest growing in Europe. Its population rose from 906,603 in Jan. 2010<ref>As of 2020, the Eurostat-defined [[Functional Urban Area]] of Geneva was made up of 93 Swiss communes and 158 French communes: [https://www.atlas.bfs.admin.ch/core/projects/13/xshared/xlsx/24193_132.xlsx Federal Statistical Office spreadsheet listing the Swiss and French communes of the Geneva Functional Urban Area].<br />Population of the 93 Swiss communes in January 2010: 541,380 (source: [https://www.bfs.admin.ch/asset/de/su-f-01.02.04.07]).<br />Population of the 158 French communes in January 2010: 365,223 (source: [https://statistiques-locales.insee.fr/#bbox=530347,5934447,355931,215247&c=indicator&i=pop_depuis_1876.pop&s=2010&selcodgeo=GEN&t=A01&view=map13]).</ref> to 1,053,436 in Jan. 2021, which means the metropolitan area registered a population growth rate of +1.39% per year during those 11 years. Growth is higher in the French part of the metropolitan area (+1.80% per year between 2010 and 2021) than in the Swiss part (+1.10% per year between 2010 and 2021), as Geneva attracts many French commuters due to high Swiss salaries and a favourable Franco-Swiss tax regime for French residents working in Switzerland.

=== Religion ===

The {{as of|2000|alt=2000 census}} recorded 66,491 residents (37.4% of the population) as Catholic, while 41,289 people (23.20%) belonged to no church or were agnostic or [[Atheism|atheist]], 24,105 (13.5%) belonged to the [[Swiss Reformed Church]], and 8,698 (4.89%) were [[Muslim]]. There were also 3,959 members of an [[Orthodoxy#Christianity|Orthodox church]] (2.22%), 220 individuals (or about 0.12% of the population) who belonged to the [[Christian Catholic Church of Switzerland]], 2,422 (1.36%) who belonged to another Christian church, and 2,601 people (1.46%) who were Jewish. There were 707 individuals who were Buddhist, 474 who were Hindu and 423 who belonged to another church. 26,575 respondents (14.93%) did not answer the question.<ref name=STAT2000/>

According to 2012 statistics by Swiss Bundesamt für Statistik 49.2% of the population were [[Christianity|Christian]], (34.2% [[Catholic]], 8.8% [[Swiss Reformed]] (organized in the [[Protestant Church of Geneva]]) and 6.2% other Christians, mostly other [[Protestants]]), 38% of Genevans were [[Irreligious|non-religious]], 6.1% were [[Muslim]] and 1.6% were Jews.<ref>{{cite web |date=1 January 2012 |title=Ständige Wohnbevölkerung ab 15 Jahren nach Religionszugehörigkeit, 2012 |language=de |publisher=Bundesamt für Statistik |url=http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/religionen.Document.21757.xls |format=xls |access-date=6 April 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106215454/http://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/portal/de/index/themen/01/05/blank/key/religionen.Document.21757.xls |archive-date=6 January 2012}}</ref>

Geneva has historically been considered a [[Protestant]] city and was known as the ''Protestant Rome'' due to it being the base of [[John Calvin]], [[William Farel]], [[Theodore Beza]] and other [[Protestant reformers]]. Over the past century, substantial immigration from France and other predominantly [[Catholic]] countries, as well as general secularization, has changed its religious landscape. As a result, three times as many Roman Catholics as Protestants lived in the city in 2000, while a large number of residents were members of neither group. Geneva forms part of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg]].

The [[World Council of Churches]] and the [[Lutheran World Federation]] both have their headquarters at the [[Ecumenical Centre]] in [[Grand-Saconnex]], Geneva. The [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]], a worldwide organization of [[Presbyterian]], [[Continental Reformed]], [[Congregational]] and other [[Calvinist]] churches gathering more than 80&nbsp;million people around the world was based here from 1948 until 2013. The executive committee of the [[World Communion of Reformed Churches]] voted in 2012 to move its offices to [[Hanover]], Germany, citing the high costs of running the ecumenical organization in Geneva, Switzerland. The move was completed in 2013. Likewise, the [[Conference of European Churches]] have moved their headquarters from Geneva to Brussels.

===="Protestant Rome"====
[[File:ReformationsdenkmalGenf1.jpg|thumb|[[Reformation Wall]] in Geneva; from left to right: [[William Farel]], [[John Calvin]], [[Theodore Beza]], and [[John Knox]]]]
Prior to the [[Protestant Reformation]] the city was ''de jure'' and ''de facto'' [[Catholic]]. Reaction to the new movement varied across Switzerland. [[John Calvin]] went to Geneva in 1536 after [[William Farel]] encouraged him to do so. In Geneva, the Catholic bishop had been obliged to seek exile in 1532. Geneva became a stronghold of [[Calvinism]]. Some of the tenets created there influenced Protestantism as a whole. [[St. Pierre Cathedral]] was where Calvin and his [[Protestant reformers]] preached. It constituted the epicentre of the newly developing Protestant thought that would later become known as the [[Reformed tradition]]. Many prominent Reformed theologians operated there, including [[William Farel]] and [[Theodore Beza]], Calvin's successor who progressed Reformed thought after his death.

Geneva was a haven for Calvinists, while Roman Catholics and others considered heretics were persecuted. The case of [[Michael Servetus]], an early [[Nontrinitarian]], is notable. Condemned by both Catholics and Protestants alike, he was arrested in Geneva and burnt at the stake as a heretic by order of the city's Protestant governing council. John Calvin and his followers denounced him, and possibly contributed to his sentence.{{citation needed|date=February 2024}}

In 1802, during its annexation to France under [[Napoleon I]], the Diocese of Geneva was united with the Diocese of Chambéry, but the 1814 Congress of Vienna and the 1816 [[Treaty of Turin (1816)|Treaty of Turin]] stipulated that in the territories transferred to a now considerably extended Geneva, the Catholic religion was to be protected and that no changes were to be made in existing conditions without an agreement with the Holy See.<ref name="CathEncy-LausanneGeneva"/> Napoleon's common policy granted civil rights to Catholics in Protestant-majority areas, as well as the reverse, and also emancipated Jews. In 1819, the city of Geneva and 20 parishes were united to the Diocese of Lausanne by [[Pope Pius VII]] and in 1822, the non-Swiss territory was made into the [[Catholic Diocese of Annecy|Diocese of Annecy]]. A variety of concord with the civil authorities came as a result of the [[separation of church and state]], enacted with strong Catholic support in 1907.<ref name="CathEncy-LausanneGeneva" />

===Crime===

== Society and culture ==

=== Media ===
The city's main newspaper is the daily ''[[Tribune de Genève]]'', with a readership of about 187,000. ''[[Le Courrier]]'' mainly focuses on Geneva. Both ''[[Le Temps]]'' (headquartered in Geneva) and ''[[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]'' are widely read in Geneva, but cover the whole of the [[Romandy]].

Geneva is the main media center for French-speaking Switzerland. It is the headquarters for the numerous French language radio and television networks of the [[Swiss Broadcasting Corporation]], known collectively as [[Radio Télévision Suisse]]. While both networks cover the whole Romandy, special programs related to Geneva are sometimes broadcast on some of the local radio frequencies. Other local radio stations broadcast from the city, including YesFM ([[FM broadcasting|FM]] 91.8&nbsp;MHz), [[Radio Cité]] (non-commercial radio, FM 92.2&nbsp;MHz), OneFM (FM 107.0&nbsp;MHz, also broadcast in [[Vaud]]), and [[World Radio Switzerland]] (FM 88.4&nbsp;MHz). Léman Bleu is a local TV channel, founded in 1996 and distributed by cable. Due to the proximity to France, many [[List of television stations in France|French television channels]] are also available.

Geneva observes ''[[Jeûne genevois]]'' on the first Thursday following the first Sunday in September. By local tradition, this commemorates the date news of the [[St. Bartholomew's Day massacre]] of Huguenots reached Geneva.

Geneva celebrates ''[[L'Escalade]]'' on the weekend nearest 12 December, celebrating the defeat of the surprise attack of troops sent by [[Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy]] during the night of 11–12 December 1602. Festive traditions include chocolate cauldrons filled with vegetable-shaped marzipan treats and the Escalade procession on horseback in seventeenth century armour. Geneva has also been organizing a 'Course de l'Escalade', which means 'Climbing Race'. This race takes place in Geneva's Old Town, and has been popular across all ages. Non-competitive racers dress up in fancy costumes, while walking in the race.

Since 1818, a [[Geneva official chestnut tree|particular chestnut tree has been used as the official "herald of the spring"]] in Geneva. The ''sautier'' (secretary of the Parliament of the Canton of Geneva) observes the tree and notes the day of arrival of the first bud. While this event has no practical effect, the sautier issues a formal [[News release|press release]] and the local newspaper will usually mention the news.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.geneve.com/en/topicblocks/a-chestnut-tree-the-official-herald-of-spring-in-geneva/ |title=A chestnut tree: the official herald of spring in Geneva |website=Geneva Alive |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180616234650/https://www.geneve.com/en/topicblocks/a-chestnut-tree-the-official-herald-of-spring-in-geneva/ |archive-date=16 June 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

As this is one of the world's oldest records of a plant's reaction to climatic conditions, researchers have been interested to note that the first bud has been appearing earlier and earlier in the year. During the 19th century many dates were in March or April. In recent years, they have usually been in late February (sometimes earlier).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.geneve.ch/fao/2006/20060814.asp |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528173142/http://www.geneve.ch/fao/2006/20060814.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 May 2008 |title=La Une de la FAO no 93 année 253 : FAO: La Treille, promenade et lieu d'observation climatique |publisher=Geneve.ch |date=14 August 2006 |access-date=3 July 2010}}</ref> In 2002, the first bud appeared unusually early, on 7 February, and then again on 29 December of the same year. The following year, one of the hottest years recorded in Europe, was a year with no bud. In 2008, the first bud also appeared early, on 19 February.

The [[Geneva Graduate Institute]] was among the first academic institutions in the world to teach international relations. It is one of Europe's most prestigious institutions, offering MA and PhD programmes in anthropology and sociology, law, political science, history, economics, international affairs, and development studies.

Geneva is also home to more than a dozen private, for-profit universities whose activities have come under scrutiny for offering degrees that are not recognized in Switzerland and engaging in "unscrupulous practices". These schools include the Geneva School of Diplomacy and International Relations, the [[International University in Geneva]], the [[Geneva Business School]] and [[IFM Business School]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=RTS |first=Camille Lanci |date=2022-11-16 |title=Geneva private universities come under the spotlight |url=https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/business/geneva-private-universities-come-under-the-spotlight/47786510 |access-date=2024-01-04 |website=SWI swissinfo.ch |language=en}}</ref>

The oldest international school in the world is the [[International School of Geneva]], founded in 1924 along with the [[League of Nations]].

Founded in 1954, [[CERN]] was one of Europe's first joint ventures and has developed as the world's largest [[particle physics]] laboratory. Physicists from around the world travel to CERN to research matter and explore the fundamental forces and materials that form the universe. It hosts the [[Large Hadron Collider]].

Geneva is home to five major libraries, the ''Bibliothèques municipales Genève'', the ''Haute école de travail social'', the ''Institut d'études sociales'', the ''Haute école de santé'', the ''École d'ingénieurs de Genève'' and the ''Haute école d'art et de design''.

== Economy ==
Geneva's economy is largely service-driven and closely linked to the rest of the canton. The city is one of the global leaders in financial centres.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.longfinance.net/documents/2902/GFCI_31_Report_2022.03.24_v1.0.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220325092748/https://www.longfinance.net/documents/2902/GFCI_31_Report_2022.03.24_v1.0.pdf |archive-date=2022-03-25 |url-status=live |title=The global financial centres index 31|access-date=26 June 2022}}</ref> Three main sectors dominate the financial sector: commodity trading; trade finance, and wealth management.

Around a third of the world's free traded oil, sugar, grains and oil seeds is traded in Geneva. Approximately 22% of the world's cotton is traded in the Lake Geneva region. Other major commodities traded in the canton include steel, electricity, or coffee.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.stsa.swiss/know/commodity-trading-companies |title=STSA |website=www.stsa.swiss |access-date=13 April 2021 |archive-date=13 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413154125/https://www.stsa.swiss/know/commodity-trading-companies |url-status=live}}</ref> Large trading companies have their regional or global headquarters in the canton, such as [[Bunge Limited|Bunge]], [[Cargill]], [[Vitol]], [[Gunvor]], [[BNP Paribas]], [[Trafigura]] or [[Mercuria Energy Group]], in addition to being home to the world's largest shipping company, [[Mediterranean Shipping Company]]. Commodity trading is sustained by a strong trade finance sector, with large banks such as [[Banque cantonale de Genève|BCGE]], BCP, BNP Paribas, [[Banque cantonale vaudoise|BCV]], [[Crédit Agricole]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[ING]], [[Société Générale]], and [[UBS]], all having their headquarters in the area for this business.

Wealth management is dominated by non-publicly listed banks and private banks, particularly [[The Pictet Group|Pictet]], [[Lombard Odier]], [[Edmond de Rothschild Group]], [[Union Bancaire Privée]], [[Mirabaud Group]], [[Dukascopy Bank]], [[Bordier & Cie]], [[Banque SYZ]], or [[REYL & Cie]]. In addition, the canton is home to the largest concentration of foreign-owned banks in Switzerland, such as [[HSBC|HSBC Private Bank]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], or [[Arab Bank]].

Behind the financial sector, the next largest major economic sector is [[watchmaking]], dominated by luxury firms such as [[Patek Philippe]], [[Vacheron Constantin]], [[Chopard]], [[Piaget SA|Piaget]], [[Rolex]], [[Roger Dubuis]], [[Franck Muller]], [[F. P. Journe]] and others, whose factories are concentrated in the [[Les Acacias]] neighbourhood, as well as the neighbouring municipalities of [[Plan-les-Ouates]], [[Satigny]], and [[Meyrin]].

Trade finance, wealth management, and watchmaking, approximately contribute two thirds of the corporate tax paid in the canton<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ge.ch/statistique/graphiques/affichage.asp?filtreGraph=06_02&dom=1 |title=Statistiques cantonales - République et canton de Genève |website=www.ge.ch |access-date=12 April 2021 |archive-date=23 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201023223639/https://www.ge.ch/statistique/graphiques/affichage.asp?filtreGraph=06_02&dom=1 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Its international mindedness, well-connected [[Geneva Airport|airport]], and centrality in the continent, also make Geneva a good destination for congresses and trade fairs, of which the largest is the [[Geneva Motor Show]] held in [[Palexpo]].

Agriculture is commonplace in the hinterlands of Geneva, particularly wheat and wine. Despite its relatively small size, the canton produces around 10% of the Swiss wine and has the highest vineyard density in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://swisswine.ch/fr/region/geneve |title=Genève |date=4 April 2016 |website=Swiss Wine |access-date=12 April 2021 |archive-date=3 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210303024337/https://swisswine.ch/fr/region/geneve |url-status=live}}</ref> The largest strains grown in Geneva are gamay, chasselas, pinot noir, gamaret, and chardonnay.

The city is served by the [[Geneva Airport]]. It is connected by [[Geneva Airport railway station]] ({{langx|fr|link=no|Gare de Genève-Aéroport}}) to both the [[Swiss Federal Railways]] network and the French [[SNCF]] network, including links to Paris, Lyon, [[Marseille]] and [[Montpellier]] by [[TGV]]. Geneva is connected to the motorway systems of both Switzerland ([[A1 (Switzerland)|A1 motorway]]) and France.

Public transport by bus, trolleybus or tram is provided by ''[[Transports Publics Genevois]]''. In addition to an extensive coverage of the city centre, the network extends to most of the municipalities of the Canton, with a few lines reaching into France. Public transport by boat is provided by the [[Mouettes Genevoises]], which link the two banks of the lake within the city, and by the {{lang|fr|[[Compagnie Générale de Navigation sur le lac Léman]]}} which serves more distant destinations such as [[Nyon]], [[Yvoire]], [[Thonon-les-Bains|Thonon]], [[Évian-les-Bains|Évian]], [[Lausanne]] and [[Montreux]] using both modern diesel vessels and vintage [[paddle steamers]].

[[File:Train Station Geneva 2006 808.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Geneva Sécheron railway station]]
Trains operated by [[Swiss Federal Railways]] connect the airport to the main station of [[Gare de Cornavin|Cornavin]] in six minutes. Regional train services are being developed towards Coppet and Bellegarde. At the city limits two new railway stations have been opened since 2002: Genève-Sécheron (close to the UN and the [[Conservatory and Botanical Garden of the City of Geneva|Botanical Gardens]]) and Lancy-Pont-Rouge.

In 2011 work started on the [[CEVA rail]] (Cornavin – [[Eaux-Vives]] – Annemasse) project, first planned in 1884, which will connect Cornavin with the Cantonal hospital, Eaux-Vives railway station and [[Annemasse]], in France. The link between the main railway station and the [[classification yard]] of La Praille already exists; from there, the line runs mostly underground to the Hospital and Eaux-Vives, where it links to the existing line to France.

Taxis in Geneva can be difficult to find, and may need to be booked in advance, especially in the early morning or at peak hours. Taxis can refuse to take babies and children because of [[Infant car seat|seating]] legislation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.20min.ch/ro/rechercher/story/27606758 |title=20 Minutes: Bebés et enfants ne sont pas bienvenus dans les taxis (French) |date=4 July 2007 |access-date=2 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080116021337/http://www.20min.ch/ro/rechercher/story/27606758 |archive-date=16 January 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Cheneviers et Verbois.jpg|thumb|The SIG-owned incinerator of Cheneviers, Verbois dam, and the solar farm]]
Water, natural gas and electricity are provided to the [[municipalities of the Canton of Geneva]] by the state-owned [[Services Industriels de Genève]], known as SIG. Most of the drinking water (80%) is extracted from the [[Lake Geneva|lake]]; the remaining 20% is provided by [[groundwater]], originally formed by infiltration from the Arve. 30% of the Canton's electricity needs is locally produced, mainly by three [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] dams on the [[Rhône]] (Seujet, Verbois and Chancy-Pougny). In addition, 13% of the electricity produced in the Canton is from the burning of waste at the [[Waste management#Incineration|waste incineration facility]] of [[Les Cheneviers]]. The remaining needs (57%) are covered by imports from other cantons in Switzerland or other European countries; SIG buys only electricity produced by [[renewable energy|renewable methods]], and in particular does not use electricity produced using [[nuclear reactor]]s or [[fossil fuels]]. Natural gas is available in the City of Geneva, as well as in about two-thirds of the municipalities of the canton, and is imported from Western Europe by the Swiss company Gaznat. SIG also provides telecommunication facilities to carriers, [[service provider]]s and large enterprises. From 2003 to 2005, "Voisin, voisine" a [[FTTH|fibre-to-the-home]] pilot project with a [[Triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] offering was launched to test the [[end-user]] market in the Charmilles district.
