==History==
{{Main|History of Luton}}

Luton is believed to have been founded by the [[Anglo-Saxons]] sometime in the 6th century.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html |title= Early history of Luton|website=Localhistories.org|access-date= 16 June 2008}}</ref> Its name first appears  in the 8th century as ''Lygetun'', meaning "town on the River Lea".<ref>{{cite book |last=Ekwall |first=Eilert |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place-Names |date=1947 |location=Oxford |publisher=The Clarendon Press |page=293 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.184064/page/n338}}</ref>

The [[Domesday Book]] records Luton as ''Loitone'' and as ''Lintone''.<ref name="domesday" /> Agriculture dominated the local economy at that time, and the town's population was around 700 to 800.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html|title=A History of Luton|website=Localhistories.org|date=14 March 2021}}</ref>

The [[hat|hat making]] industry began in the 17th century and became synonymous with the town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/luton/0.local/hat_plaiting.htm |publisher=Luton Libraries |work=Plaiting and Straw Hat Making |title=A history hat making in Luton |access-date=18 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527182358/http://www.galaxy.bedfordshire.gov.uk/webingres/luton/0.local/hat_plaiting.htm |archive-date=27 May 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/hat-industry-luton-buildings/hat-industry-luton-and-buildings/|title=The Hat Industry of Luton and its Buildings|website=English Heritage|quote=Long before it became associated with motor cars, Luton was well established as an international centre of hat making.

[[File:11 to 19 George Street, Luton.jpg|thumb|left|A row of largely Grade II listed buildings in George Street West, Luton]]

The town grew: in 1801 the population was 3,095,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html|title=Population figures for 1801, 1901 and 1901 |access-date=16 June 2008}}</ref> but by 1850 it was over 10,000 and by 1901 it was almost 39,000.

Newspaper printing arrived in the town in 1854. The first public cemetery was opened in the same year and Luton was made a [[borough]] in 1876.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html|title=Luton was made a borough|access-date=16 June 2008}}</ref>

Luton's [[Hatmaking|hat trade]] reached its peak in the 1930s,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/hat-industry-luton-buildings/hat-industry-luton-and-buildings.pdf/|title=The Hat Industry of Luton and its Buildings|date=2013|publisher=Historic England|access-date=23 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180124135612/https://content.historicengland.org.uk/images-books/publications/hat-industry-luton-buildings/hat-industry-luton-and-buildings.pdf/|archive-date=24 January 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> but severely declined after the Second World War and was replaced by other industries.

In 1907, [[Vauxhall Motors]] opened the largest car plant in the United Kingdom in Luton, during the [[Second World War]], it built [[Churchill tank]]s<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/threecounties/peoples_war/vauxhall_tanks.shtml |title=Churchill Tanks at Vauxhall |website=Bbc.co.uk |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> as part of the [[war effort]]. Despite heavy camouflage, the factory made Luton a target for the [[Luftwaffe]] and the town suffered a number of [[Strategic bombing|air raid]]s. 107 died<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html |title=Deaths during WWII |website=Localhistories.org |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref> and there was extensive damage to the town (over 1,500 homes were damaged or destroyed).

[[File:LutonTownHallOld.JPG|thumb|left|The first [[Luton Town Hall|town hall]] was destroyed in 1919]]
The original town hall was destroyed in 1919 during Peace Day celebrations at the end of the [[First World War]]. Dr. John G. Dony, author of The Flora of Bedfordshire<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/part/170088|title=Flora of Bedfordshire by John G. Dony|first=Jean|last=Langenheim|date=4 May 1954|journal=Madroño; a West American journal of botany.|volume=12|pages=223}}</ref> told his history students (he taught at Luton Grammar, predecessor of [[Luton Sixth Form College]]), during the 1950s, that he had broken the last intact window of the old town hall during the 1919 riots. Local people, including many ex-servicemen, were unhappy with unemployment and had been refused the use of a local park to hold celebratory events. They stormed the town hall, setting it alight (''see [[Luton Town Hall]]''). A replacement building was completed in 1936.

Luton Borough Corporation had provided the borough with electricity since the early twentieth century from [[Luton power station]], located adjacent to the railway. Upon [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership passed to the [[British Electricity Authority]] and later to the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]]. Electricity connections to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|national grid]] rendered the 23 [[Watt|megawatt]] (MW) coal and latterly oil-fired power station redundant. The station had a single chimney and two reinforced concrete cooling towers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/ltfc_1885/status/730868016032944128|title=Luton town centre with the old cooling towers|date=12 May 2016|website=Twitter|access-date=3 February 2020}}</ref> The power station closed in 1968; in its final year of operation it delivered 3,192 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity to the borough.<ref>''CEGB Statistical Yearbook 1968'', CEGB, London</ref>

[[London Luton Airport|Luton Airport]] opened in 1938, owned and operated by the council. It is now one of the largest employers in the area.

The pre-war years, were something of an economic boom for Luton, as new industries grew and prospered. New private and [[council housing]] was built in the 1920s and 1930s, with Luton starting to incorporate nearby villages [[Leagrave]], [[Limbury]] and [[Stopsley]] between 1928 and 1933.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/luton.html |title=A History of Luton |website=Localhistories.org |access-date=17 March 2013}}</ref>

Post-war, a number of substantial estates of [[Council house|council housing]] were built, notably at [[Farley Hill, Bedfordshire|Farley Hill]], [[Stopsley]], [[Limbury]], [[Marsh Farm]] and [[Leagrave]] ([[Hockwell Ring]]). The [[Marsh Farm]] area of the town was developed in the mid to late 1960s as a large council housing estate, mostly to house the overspill population from [[London]]. However, the estate gained a reputation for high levels of crime, poverty and unemployment, which culminated in a riot on the estate in July 1992 and another more serious riot three years later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/extra-police-sent-to-riothit-estate-1590326.html|title=Extra police sent to riot-hit estate|date=23 October 2011|website=The Independent}}</ref>

The closure of the Vauxhall manufacturing plant in 2002 had negative effects for Luton, leading to increased unemployment and deprivation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/immigrants-who-voted-for-brexit-luton-migration/|title=Meet the immigrants who voted for Brexit|date=25 August 2016|website=POLITICO}}</ref>

==Governance==
{{see also|Politics in Luton}}
There is just one tier of local government covering Luton: [[Luton Borough Council]], which has been a [[unitary authority]] since 1997, being a [[non-metropolitan district|district council]] which also performs the functions of a [[non-metropolitan county|county council]]. There are no [[civil parish]]es in the borough.<ref name=electionmaps>{{cite web |title=Election Maps |url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/gb/ |website=Ordnance Survey |access-date=2 November 2024}}</ref> The borough remains part of the [[ceremonial county]] of [[Bedfordshire]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Lieutenancies Act 1997|year=1997|chapter=23|schedule=1|access-date=29 May 2024}}</ref>

Luton was an [[ancient parish]] in the [[Hundreds of Bedfordshire|Flitt hundred]]. The parish was the largest in Bedfordshire by area, and was subdivided into five [[Hamlet (place)|hamlets]] or [[Township (England)|townships]]: [[Hyde, Bedfordshire|Hyde]], [[Leagrave]], [[Limbury]], [[Stopsley]], and a Luton township covering the central part of the parish including the town itself.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Page |editor1-first=William |title=A History of the County of Bedford: Volume 2 |date=1908 |publisher=Victoria County History |location=London |pages=348–375 |url=https://www.british-history.ac.uk/vch/beds/vol2/pp348-375 |access-date=2 November 2024 |chapter=Parishes: Luton}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Luton Ancient Parish / Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10207563 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=2 November 2024}}</ref> The Luton township was made a [[local board of health|local board district]] in 1850. The local board was the town's first elected local authority; previously it had been administered by the parish [[vestry]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=21106|page=1745|date=21 June 1850}}</ref>

The town was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] in 1876.<ref>{{cite news |title=The incorporation of Luton |url=https://www.findmypast.co.uk/search-newspapers |access-date=6 May 2023 |work=Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire News |date=4 March 1876 |location=Luton |page=8}}</ref> Later in 1876 the new borough council was granted a [[coat of arms]].<ref name="coatofarms">{{Cite web|url=https://www.heraldry-wiki.com/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Luton|title=Luton - Coat of arms (crest) of Luton|website=Heraldry-wiki.com|date=12 January 2022 }}</ref> The [[wikt:sheaf|wheatsheaf]] was used on the crest to represent agriculture and the supply of straw used in the local [[hatmaking]] industry (the [[straw plaiting]] industry was brought to Luton by a group of Scots under the protection of Sir [[John Napier]] of [[Luton Hoo]]). The bee is traditionally the emblem of industry and the hive represents the straw plaiting industry for which Luton was famous. The rose is from the arms of the Napier family, whereas the [[thistle]] is a symbol for [[Scotland]]. An alternative suggestion is that the rose was a national emblem, and the thistle represents the [[Marquess of Bute]], who formerly owned the Manor of Luton Hoo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/thames_valley_chilterns.html#luton%20bc |title=Luton Town Coat of Arms|access-date=30 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/gbr/l/luton.htm|title=Arms of Luton (England)|access-date=18 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925145600/http://www.ngw.nl/int/gbr/l/luton.htm|archive-date=25 September 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[Local Government Act 1894]] directed that parishes could no longer straddle borough boundaries, and so the ancient parish was split into a Luton parish covering the same area as the borough and a Luton Rural parish covering the area outside the borough.<ref>{{cite web |title=Luton Rural Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10112618 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=2 November 2024}}</ref> Luton Rural was abolished in 1896 and its area divided into the four parishes of Hyde, Leagrave, Limbury and Stopsley. In 1928 the Leagrave and Limbury parishes were both abolished and their areas absorbed into the borough of Luton;<ref>Ministry of Health Provisional Order Confirmation (Luton Extension) Act, 1928</ref> Stopsley was similarly absorbed in 1933.<ref>Ministry of Health Order No. 77050. The South Bedfordshire Review Order 1933.</ref> Hyde remains a separate parish, now forming part of [[Central Bedfordshire]].<ref name=electionmaps/>

Luton was made a [[county borough]] in 1964, making it independent from [[Bedfordshire County Council]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Luton MB/CB |url=https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10133580 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=28 August 2021}}</ref> It was redesignated as a [[non-metropolitan district]] in 1974, making it once more subordinate to the county council. In 1997 the borough council was made a unitary authority, regaining its independence from the county council (which was subsequently abolished in 2009).

==Geography==
[[File:WardownLake.jpg|thumb|right|A pedestrian [[suspension bridge]] spans the [[River Lee (England)|River Lea]] in [[Wardown Park]].]]
[[File:Lutonsnowoct08.JPG|thumb|left|Snow accumulation over the [[Chiltern Hills]] during [[October 2008 United Kingdom cold wave|October 2008]] snowfall, Luton is denoted by the yellow dot.]]

Luton is situated 28 miles north of [[London]] and 39 miles southwest of [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]]. The town forms the core part of the wider [[Luton/Dunstable Urban Area]] which includes the nearby towns of [[Dunstable]] and [[Houghton Regis]] in [[Central Bedfordshire]]. The town is the most populous settlement in [[Bedfordshire]] followed by [[Bedford]].<ref>{{cite web |title=A HISTORY OF LUTON |url=https://localhistories.org/a-history-of-luton/ |website=Local Histories |access-date=11 October 2021 |date=14 March 2021}}</ref>

Luton is located in a break in the eastern part of the [[Chiltern Hills]]. The Chilterns are a mixture of [[chalk]] from the [[Cretaceous]] period<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bedsrigs.org.uk/map.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129014606/http://www.bedsrigs.org.uk/map.html|url-status=dead|title=Map of soil distribution in Beds|archive-date=29 January 2007|access-date=29 January 2022}}</ref> (about 66 – 145&nbsp;million years ago) and deposits laid at the southernmost points of the [[ice sheet]] during the [[Last glacial period|last ice age]] (the [[Warden Hill, Bedfordshire|Warden Hill]] area can be seen from much of the town).

[[Bedfordshire]] had a reputation for brick making but the industry is now significantly reduced. The [[brickworks]]<ref>{{Cite book|isbn = 1-871199-94-8|title = Stopsley Picture Book|last1 = Dyer|first1 = James|year = 1999| publisher=Book Castle }}</ref> at [[Stopsley]] took advantage of the clay deposits in the east of the town.

The source of the [[River Lee (England)|River Lea]], part of the [[Thames Valley]] [[drainage basin]], is in the [[Leagrave]] area of the town. The [[Bramingham#Bramingham Wood|Great Bramingham Wood]] surrounds this area. It is classified as [[ancient woodland]]; records mention the wood at least 400 years ago.

There are few routes through the hilly area for some miles, this has led to several major roads (including the [[M1 motorway|M1]] and the [[A6 road (England)|A6]]) and a major rail-link being constructed through the town.

===Climate===
Luton has a [[temperateness|temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|marine climate]], like much of the [[British Isles]], with generally light [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] throughout the year. The weather is very changeable from day to day and the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] makes the region mild for its [[latitude]]. The average total annual rainfall is {{convert|698|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} with rain falling on 117 days of the year.

The local climate around Luton is differentiated somewhat from much of South East England due to its position in the [[Chiltern Hills]], meaning it tends to be 1–2 degrees Celsius cooler than the surrounding towns – often flights at [[London Luton Airport|Luton airport]], lying {{convert|160|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, will be suspended when marginal snow events occur, while airports at lower elevations, such as [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]], at {{convert|25|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, continue to function.

Luton has seen several waves of immigration. In the early part of the 20th century, migrants from [[Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Scotland|Scotland]] came to the town. These were followed by [[South Asia]]n and [[British African-Caribbean community|Afro-Caribbean]] immigrants. More recently immigrants from [[Europe]]an countries such as [[Albania]] have made Luton their home. As a result of this Luton has a diverse ethnic mix, with a significant population of Asian descent, mainly [[British Pakistanis|Pakistani]] (41,143 residents, 18.3%) and [[Bangladeshi people|Bangladeshi]] (20,630, 9.2%).<ref name="TS021">{{cite web |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/TS021/editions/2021/versions/3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231004032733/https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/TS021/editions/2021/versions/3 |archive-date=4 October 2023 |title=Ethnic group Census 2021: dataset TS021  |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=29 November 2022 |website=ons.gov.uk |publisher=Office for National Statistics |access-date=22 March 2024}}</ref> People in Asian ethnic groups accounted for 86% of Luton's [[Muslim]] population in 2021.<ref name="RM031">{{cite web |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/RM031/editions/2021/versions/1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240215075531/https://www.ons.gov.uk/datasets/RM031/editions/2021/versions/1 |archive-date=15 February 2024 |title=Ethnic group by religion: Census 2021 dataset RM031 |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=29 November 2022 |website=ons.gov.uk |publisher=Office for National Statistics |access-date=22 March 2024}}</ref>

Luton has a variety of parks ranging from district parks, neighbourhood parks, local open space and leisure gardens.

====Brantwood Park====
In the 1880s, the land now known as Brantwood Park was an open field on the south side of [[Dallow]]. The site was purchased by the Town Council in 1894 for use as a recreation ground and there is reference to it as ‘West Ward Recreation Ground' in a 1911-year book. It is reported as being one of the first two recreation grounds in Luton; the other being East Ward Recreation Ground, now known as Manor Park.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.luton.gov.uk/Page/error?errormessage=Page%20not%20found|title=Error|website=m.luton.gov.uk}}</ref>

====Kidney Wood====
Kidney Wood is ancient semi-natural [[woodland]] on the southern edge of Luton that has been identified as a County Wildlife Site. The wood was purchased by [[Luton Borough Council]] as an area of public open space. The council seeks to maintain and enhance the nature conservation interest of Kidney Wood, including its habitats while allowing public access for informal recreation including play. Kidney Wood includes a way marked nature trail and play dells.

====Memorial Park====
Sir Julius Wernher purchased the [[Luton Hoo]] Estate and the Manor of Luton from Madame de Falbe around 1903. He carried out substantial renovation works to the Manor and grounds. On his death in 1912 the estate passed to Lady Ludlow. Lady Ludlow presented the Park to the people of Luton on 12 June 1920, in memory of her son Alex Piggott Werner, who was killed in action during the First World War. The site is officially named Luton Hoo Memorial Park. Council records state that the area was purchased under the Statutory Powers of the Public Health Acts.

Shops and businesses in the remaining streets, particularly in the roads around Cheapside and in High Town, have been in decline ever since. George Street, on the south side of the Arndale, was pedestrianised in the 1990s.

The shopping centre had some construction and re-design work done to it over the 2011/12 period, with a new square built to be used for leisure events, as well as a number of new food restaurants. Contained within the main shopping centre is the market, which contains butchers, fishmongers, fruit and veg, hairdressers, tattoo parlours, ice cream, a flower stall, T-shirt printing and the market's original sewing shop for clothes alterations and repairs as well as eating places.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lutonindoormarket.co.uk/index.php/shop-and-eat/|title=Shop & Eat {{!}} Luton Indoor Market|language=en-US|access-date=20 March 2019}}</ref>
