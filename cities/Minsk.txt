'''Minsk''' ({{langx|be|Мінск}} {{IPA-be|mʲinsk|}}; {{langx|ru|Минск}} {{IPA-ru|mʲinsk|}}) is the capital and largest city of [[Belarus]], located on the [[Svislach (Berezina)|Svislach]] and the now subterranean [[Nyamiha|Niamiha]] rivers. As the capital, Minsk has a special administrative status in Belarus and is the administrative centre of [[Minsk Region]] and [[Minsk District]]. As of 2024, it has a population of about two million,<ref name="pop"/> making Minsk the [[Largest cities in Europe|11th-most populous city in Europe]]. Minsk is one of the administrative capitals of the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) and the [[Eurasian Economic Union]] (EAEU).

First mentioned in 1067, Minsk became the capital of the [[Principality of Minsk]], an [[appanage]] of the [[Principality of Polotsk]], before being annexed by the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in 1242. It received [[town privileges]] in 1499.<ref>{{cite web |title=История Минска |url=http://minsk950.belta.by/history |access-date=31 May 2019 |website=minsk950.belta.by |archive-date=5 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105141350/https://minsk950.belta.by/history |url-status=dead }}</ref> From 1569, it was the capital of [[Minsk Voivodeship]], an administrative division of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It was part of the territories annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] in 1793, as a consequence of the [[Second Partition of Poland]]. From 1919 to 1991, after the [[Russian Revolution]], Minsk was the capital of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]], which became a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|republic]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1922. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Minsk became the capital of the newly independent Republic of Belarus.

== Etymology and historical names ==
[[File:Church of Saints Simon and Helena, 15, Soviet str., Minsk - the capital of Republic of Belarus 04.JPG|thumb|[[Independence Square, Minsk|Independence Square]] in the centre of Minsk]]
The [[Old East Slavic]] name of the town was Мѣньскъ (i.e. ''Měnsk'' &lt; [[Proto-Slavic language|Early Proto-Slavic]] or [[Proto-Indo-European language|Late Indo-European]] ''Mēnĭskŭ''), derived from a river name ''Měn'' (&lt;&nbsp;''Mēnŭ''). 
The resulting{{clarify|date=August 2020}} form of the name, ''Minsk'' (spelled either Минскъ or Мѣнскъ), was taken over both in Russian (modern spelling: Минск) and Polish (''Mińsk''), and under the [[Russification of Belarus|influence of Russian]] this form also became official in Belarusian.  The direct continuation of the name in Belarusian is ''Miensk'' ({{lang|be|[[wikt:Менск#Belarusian|Менск]]}}, {{IPA-be|ˈmʲɛnsk|IPA}}),<ref>{{cite web |title=Происхождение названия Минска. |url=https://govorim.by/minskaya-oblast/minsk/stati-o-minske/7824-proishozhdenie-nazvaniya-minska.html |access-date=30 May 2019 |website=Городские порталы Беларуси – Govorim.by}}</ref> which some Belarusian-speakers continue to use as their preferred name for the city.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ru:79-лет назад Верховный совет БССР переименовал Менск в Минск |url=https://belsat.eu/ru/news/79-let-nazad-verhovnyj-sovet-bssr-pereimenoval-mensk-v-minsk/ |access-date=30 May 2019 |website=belsat.eu |language=ru-RU}}</ref>

When Belarus was under Polish rule, the names ''Mińsk Litewski'' ("Minsk of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]") and ''Mińsk Białoruski'' ("Minsk of Belarus") were used to differentiate this place name from [[Mińsk Mazowiecki]] 'Minsk in [[Masovia]]'. In modern Polish, ''Mińsk'' without an attribute usually refers to the city in Belarus, which is about 50 times bigger than Mińsk Mazowiecki; (cf. [[Brest, Belarus|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Brześć Kujawski]] for a similar case).<ref>{{cite web |title=Wirtualny Mińsk Mazowiecki |url=https://minskmaz.com/ |access-date=30 May 2019 |website=minskmaz.com}}</ref>

The [[Svislach (Berezina)|Svislach River]] valley was the settlement boundary between two early East Slavic tribes&nbsp;– the [[Krivichs]] and [[Dregovichs]]. By 980, the area was incorporated into the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] [[Principality of Polotsk]], one of the earliest East Slavic principalities of [[Kievan Rus']]. Minsk was first mentioned in the name form ''Měneskъ'' (Мѣнескъ) in the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' for the year 1067 in association with the [[Battle on the Nemiga River|Battle on the River Nemiga]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Въ лЂто 6563 [1055]&nbsp;– [6579 1071].

In the early 12th century, the [[Principality of Polotsk]] disintegrated into smaller fiefs. The [[Principality of Minsk]] was established by one of the [[Polotsk]] dynasty princes. In 1129, the Principality of Minsk was annexed by [[Principality of Kiev|Kiev]], the dominant principality of [[Kievan Rus']]; however in 1146 the Polotsk dynasty regained control of the principality. By 1150, Minsk rivalled Polotsk as the major city in the former Principality of Polotsk. The princes of Minsk and Polotsk were engaged in years of struggle trying to unite all lands previously under the rule of Polotsk.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ru:Полоцкое княжество |url=http://history-belarus.by/pages/terms/polotsk_principality.php |access-date=30 May 2019 |website=history-belarus.by |language=ru |archive-date=14 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190614104053/http://history-belarus.by/pages/terms/polotsk_principality.php |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Minsk escaped the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion of Rus]] in 1237–1239. In 1242, Minsk became a part of the expanding [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. It joined peacefully and local elites enjoyed high rank in the society of the Grand Duchy. In 1413, the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] entered into a union. Minsk became the centre of [[Minsk Voivodeship|Minsk Voivodship]] (province). In 1441, as [[Grand Duke of Lithuania]], [[Casimir IV Jagiellon|Casimir IV]] included Minsk in a list of cities enjoying certain privileges, and in 1499, during the reign of his son, [[Alexander Jagiellon|Alexander I Jagiellon]], Minsk received [[town privileges]] under [[Magdeburg rights|Magdeburg law]]. In 1569, after the [[Union of Lublin]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] merged into a single state, the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Hill |first=Melissa |title=Belarus |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/retrieve.do?tabID=T003&resultListType=RESULT_LIST&searchResultsType=SingleTab&searchType=AdvancedSearchForm&currentPosition=1&docId=GALE%7CCX3652100245&docType=Country+overview&sort=RELEVANCE&contentSegment=&prodId=GVRL&contentSet=GALE%7CCX3652100245&searchId=R1&userGroupName=lom_accessmich&inPS=true# |access-date=4 June 2019 |website=Worldmark Encyclopedia of Nations |publisher=Gale}}</ref>

By the middle of the 16th century, Minsk was an important economic and cultural centre in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. It was also an important centre for the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]]. Following the [[Union of Brest]], both the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] and the Roman Catholic Church increased in influence.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 1655, Minsk was conquered by troops of [[Alexis of Russia|Tsar Alexei]] of Russia.<ref>Robert I. Frost. ''After the Deluge: Poland-Lithuania and the Second Northern War, 1655–1660''. [[Cambridge University Press]]. 2004. p. 48.</ref> Russians governed the city until 1660 when it was regained by [[John II Casimir]], Grand Duke of Lithuania and King of Poland. By the end of the [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)|Polish-Russian War]], Minsk had only about 2,000 residents and just 300 houses. The second wave of devastation occurred during the [[Great Northern War]], when Minsk was occupied in 1708 and 1709 by the army of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] and then by the army of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}} The last decades of the Polish rule involved decline or very slow development, since Minsk had become a small provincial town of little economic or military significance.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

All of the initial [[street or road name|street names]] were replaced by Russian names, though the spelling of the city's name remained unchanged. It was briefly occupied by the [[Grande Armée]] during [[French invasion of Russia]] in 1812.<ref>{{cite web |date=26 December 2012 |script-title=ru:Какие следы оставили войска Наполеона на территории современной Беларуси? |url=https://news.tut.by/society/322931.html |access-date=31 May 2019 |website=TUT.BY |language=ru |archive-date=14 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814232748/https://news.tut.by/society/322931.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Throughout the 19th century, the city continued to grow and significantly improve. In the 1830s, major streets and squares of Minsk were cobbled and paved. A first public library was opened in 1836, and a fire brigade was put into operation in 1837. In 1838, the first local newspaper, ''Minskiye gubernskiye vedomosti'' ("Minsk province news") went into circulation. The first theatre was established in 1844. By 1860, Minsk was an important trading city with a population of 27,000. There was a construction boom that led to the building of two- and three-story brick and stone houses in ''Upper Town''.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |last=darriuss |date=25 September 2015 |title=Было — стало: Минск вековой давности и сейчас – Недвижимость Onliner |url=https://realt.onliner.by/2015/09/25/revolution |access-date=31 May 2019 |website=Onliner |language=ru}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=История |url=https://minsk-starazhytny.by/history |access-date=31 May 2019 |website=minsk-starazhytny.by}}</ref>

Minsk's development was boosted by improvements in transportation. In 1846, the Moscow-[[Warsaw]] road was laid through Minsk. In 1871, a railway link between Moscow and Warsaw ran via Minsk, and in 1873, a new [[Libau–Romny Railway|railway from Romny in Ukraine to the Baltic Sea port of Libava]] ([[Liepāja]]) was also constructed. Thus Minsk became an important rail junction and a manufacturing hub. A [[water supply network|municipal water supply]] was introduced in 1872, the telephone in 1890, the horse tram in 1892, and the first power generator in 1894. By 1900, Minsk had 58 factories employing 3,000 workers. The city also boasted theatres, cinemas, newspapers, schools and colleges, as well as numerous monasteries, churches, synagogues, and a mosque. According to the 1897 [[Russian Empire Census|Russian census]], the city had 91,494 inhabitants, with some 47,561 Jews constituting more than half of the city population.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{cite web |last=darriuss |date=9 August 2017 |title=Было — стало: Минск, который мы, к счастью, потеряли – Недвижимость Onliner |url=https://realt.onliner.by/2017/08/09/vyoska |access-date=31 May 2019 |website=Onliner |language=ru}}</ref>

In the early years of the 20th century, Minsk was a major centre for the worker's movement in Belarus. The [[1st Congress of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]], the forerunner to the [[Bolshevik]]s and eventually the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]], was held there in 1898. It was also one of the major centres of the [[Belarusian national revival]], alongside [[Vilnius]]. However, the [[First World War]] significantly affected the development of Minsk. By 1915, Minsk was a battlefront city. Some factories were closed down, and residents began evacuating to the east. Minsk became the headquarters of [[Western Front (Soviet Union)|the Western Front]] of the Russian army and also housed military hospitals and [[military logistics|military supply]] bases.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] had an immediate effect in Minsk. A Workers' Soviet was established in Minsk in October 1917, drawing much of its support from disaffected soldiers and workers. After the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], [[Belarusian-Polish administration of Minsk|German forces occupied Minsk]] on 21 February 1918.<ref>{{Cite news |date=29 October 2013 |title=History |work=Belarusian Tour operator |url=http://www.belintourist.com/eng/learn_about_belarus/region/minsk/ |url-status=dead |access-date=29 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103093706/http://www.belintourist.com/eng/learn_about_belarus/region/minsk/ |archive-date=3 November 2013}}</ref> On 25 March 1918, Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the [[Belarusian People's Republic]]. The republic was short-lived; in December 1918, Minsk was taken over by the [[Red Army]]. In January 1919 Minsk was proclaimed the capital of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]], though later in 1919 (see [[Operation Minsk]]) and again in 1920, the city was controlled by the [[Second Polish Republic]] during the course of the [[Polish–Soviet War|Polish-Bolshevik War]] between 8 August 1919 and 11 July 1920 and again between 14 October 1920 and 19 March 1921. Under the terms of the [[Peace of Riga]], Minsk was handed back to the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]] and became the capital of the Byelorussian SSR, one of the founding republics of the [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

A programme of reconstruction and development was begun in 1922. By 1924, there were 29 factories in operation; schools, museums, theatres and libraries were also established. Throughout the 1920s and the 1930s, Minsk saw rapid development with dozens of new factories being built and new schools, colleges, higher education establishments, hospitals, theatres and cinemas being opened. During this period, Minsk was also a centre for the development of Belarusian language and culture.<ref>{{cite web

Before the [[Second World War]], Minsk had a population of 300,000 people. The Germans captured Minsk in the [[Battle of Białystok–Minsk]], as part of [[Operation Barbarossa]]; [[Bombing of Minsk in World War II|after it had been devastated]] by the [[Luftwaffe]]. However, some factories, museums, and tens of thousands of civilians had been evacuated to the east. The Germans designated Minsk the administrative centre of ''[[Generalbezirk Weissruthenien|Generalbezirk Weißruthenien]]''. Communists and sympathisers were killed or imprisoned, both locally and after being transported to Germany. Homes were requisitioned to house invading German forces. Thousands starved as food was seized by the German Army and paid work was scarce. Minsk was the site of one of the largest Nazi-run [[ghetto]]s in the Second World War, temporarily housing over 100,000 Jews (see [[Minsk Ghetto]]). Some anti-Soviet residents of Minsk, who hoped that Belarus could regain independence, did support the Germans, especially at the beginning of the occupation, but by 1942, Minsk had become a major centre of the [[Soviet partisans|Soviet partisan]] [[resistance movement]] against the invasion, in what is known as the ''[[Eastern Front (World War II)|German-Soviet War]]''. For this role, Minsk was awarded the title ''[[Hero City (Soviet Union)|Hero City]]'' in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inyourpocket.com/minsk/Hero-City_136881v |title=Hero City &#124; Sightseeing &#124; Minsk |publisher=Inyourpocket.com |date= |accessdate=2022-02-26}}</ref>

Minsk was recaptured by Soviet troops on 3 July 1944 in [[Minsk Offensive]] as part of [[Operation Bagration]]. The city was the centre of German resistance to the Soviet advance and saw heavy fighting during the first half of 1944. Factories, municipal buildings, [[power station]]s, bridges, most roads, and 80% of the houses were reduced to rubble. In 1944, Minsk's population was reduced to a mere 50,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.roughguides.com/articles/minsk-belarus/ |title=Explore Minsk: the Belarusian capital |publisher=Rough Guides |date=2021-06-18 |accessdate=2022-02-26}}</ref>

The historical centre was replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by [[Stalinist architecture]], which favoured grand buildings, broad avenues and wide squares. Subsequently, the city grew rapidly as a result of massive industrialisation. Since the 1960s Minsk's population has also grown apace, reaching 1&nbsp;million in 1972 and 1.5&nbsp;million in 1986.
Construction of [[Minsk Metro]] began on 16 June 1977, and the system was opened to the public on 30 June 1984, becoming the ninth metro system in the Soviet Union.
The rapid population growth was primarily driven by mass migration of young, unskilled workers from rural areas of Belarus, as well as by migration of [[skilled worker]]s from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Marples |first=David R. |date=1 November 2016 |title=The "Minsk Phenomenon:" demographic development in the Republic of Belarus |journal=Nationalities Papers |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=919–931 |doi=10.1080/00905992.2016.1218451 |s2cid=131971740 |issn=0090-5992}}</ref> To house the expanding population, Minsk spread beyond its historical boundaries.

Throughout the 1990s, after the fall of Communism, the city continued to change. As the capital of a newly independent country, Minsk quickly acquired the attributes of a major city. Embassies were opened, and a number of Soviet administrative buildings became government centres. During the early and mid-1990s, Minsk was hit by an [[Financial crisis|economic crisis]] and many development projects were halted, resulting in high unemployment and underemployment. Since the late 1990s, there have been improvements in transport and infrastructure, and a housing boom has been underway since 2002. On the outskirts of Minsk, new ''[[Microdistrict|mikroraions]]'' of [[residential area|residential development]] have been built. Metro lines have been extended, and the road system (including the [[MKAD (Minsk)|Minsk BeltWay]]) has been improved. In recent years Minsk has been continuously decentralizing,<ref name="realty1">{{Cite news |title=Минск-2030: где будут новые жилые центры города |url=https://realty.tut.by/news/offtop-realty/568263.html?crnd=69395 |access-date=11 November 2017 |archive-date=3 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210303201003/https://realty.tut.by/news/offtop-realty/568263.html?crnd=69395 |url-status=dead }}</ref> with a third line of the [[Minsk Metro]] opening in 2020. More development is planned for several areas outside the city centre, while the future of the older neighborhoods is still unclear.<ref name="realty1"/>

== Geography ==
[[File:Minsk city (Belarus), Sentinel-2 satellite image, 2019-05-19.jpg|left|thumb|Minsk satellite photo, 2019]]Minsk is located on the southeastern slope of the Minsk Hills, a region of rolling hills running from the southwest (upper reaches of the river [[Neman|Nioman]]) to the northeast<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2hOoAwAAQBAJ&dq=minsk+hills&pg=PT73 |title=Two Years in a Gulag: The True Wartime Story of a Polish Peasant Exiled to ... - Frank Pleszak |via=Google Books |isbn=9781445626048 |date=2013-02-15 |accessdate=2022-02-26|last1=Pleszak |first1=Frank |publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited }}</ref>– that is, to Lukomskaye Lake in northwestern [[Belarus]]. The average altitude above sea level is {{convert|220|m}}. The physical geography of Minsk was shaped over the two [[Quaternary glaciation|most recent ice ages]]. The [[Svislach (Berezina)|Svislach River]], which flows across the city from the northwest to the southeast, is in the ''[[urstromtal]]'', an ancient river valley formed by water flowing from melting [[ice sheet]]s at the end of the last Ice Age. There are six smaller rivers within the city limits, all part of the [[Black Sea]] basin.

Minsk is in the area of [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]] typical of most of Belarus. Pinewood and mixed forests border the edge of the city, especially in the north and east. Some of the forests were preserved as parks (for instance, the [[Chelyuskinites Park]]) as the city grew.

The city was initially built on the hills, which allowed for defensive fortifications, and the western parts of the city are the most hilly.

In {{Cvt|5|km}} from the northwestern edge of city lies large [[Zaslawskaye reservoir]], often called the Minsk sea. It is the second largest reservoir in Belarus, constructed in 1956.<ref>{{cite web |title=Минское море (Заславское водохранилище) |url=https://planetabelarus.by/sights/minskoe-more-zaslavskoe-vodokhranilishche/ |website=planetabelarus.by |access-date=7 June 2022 |language=ru |archive-date=2 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220702144521/https://planetabelarus.by/sights/minskoe-more-zaslavskoe-vodokhranilishche/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Minsk has a warm summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification#Dfb/Dwb/Dsb: Warm summer continental or hemiboreal climates|Köppen ''Dfb'']]), although its weather is oftentimes unpredictable, given its location between the strong influence of the moist air over the Atlantic Ocean and the dry air over the [[Eurasia]]n landmass. Its weather is unstable and tends to change relatively often. The average January temperature is {{convert|−4.2|°C}}, while the average July temperature is {{convert|19.1|°C|1|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature was recorded on 17 January 1940, at {{convert|−39.1|°C|0|abbr=on}} and the warmest on 8 August 2015 at {{convert|35.8|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Fog is frequent, especially in the autumn and spring. Minsk receives {{convert|686|mm|in}} of [[precipitation]] annually, of which one-third falls during the cold period of the year (as snow or rain) and two-thirds during the warm period. Throughout the year, winds are generally westerly or northwesterly, bringing cool and moist air from the Atlantic.

=== Ethnic groups ===
During its first centuries, Minsk was a city with a predominantly Early East Slavic population (the forefathers of modern-day [[Belarusians]]). After the 1569 [[Polish–Lithuanian union]], the city became a destination for migrating Poles (who worked as administrators, clergy, teachers and soldiers) and Jews ([[Ashkenazim]], who worked in the retail trade and as craftsmen, as other opportunities were prohibited by discrimination laws). During the last centuries of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], many Minsk residents became [[Polonization|polonised]], adopting the language of the dominant Poles and assimilating to its culture.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

After the second partition of Poland-Lithuania in 1793, Minsk and its larger region became part of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russians]] dominated the city's culture as had the Poles in the earlier centuries.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

At the time of the [[Russian Empire Census|1897 census]] under the Russian Empire, Jews were the largest ethnic group in Minsk, at 52% of the population, with 47,500 of the 91,000 residents.<ref>Joshua D. Zimmerman, ''Poles, Jews and the Politics of Nationality'', Univ of Wisconsin Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-299-19464-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6sbr9cZyw_4C&dq=population+Brest+Poles+Jews&pg=PA16 Google Print, p.16]</ref> Other substantial ethnic groups were Russians (25.5%), Poles (11.4%) and Belarusians (9%). The latter figure may be not accurate, as some local Belarusians were likely counted as Russians. A small traditional community of [[Lipka Tatars]] had been living in Minsk for centuries.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wilson |first=Andrew |title=Belarus: The last European dictatorship |date=2021 |isbn=978-0-300-26087-8 |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=30 |oclc=1240724890}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Tatars In Belarus Hope For Help From Tatarstan |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/Tatars_In_Belarus_Hope_For_Help_From_Tatarstan/2126354.html |access-date=2022-08-17 |newspaper=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=31 August 2010 |language=en}}</ref>

Between the 1880s and 1930s, many Jews, as well as peasants from other backgrounds, emigrated from the city to the United States as part of a [[Belarusian diaspora]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}
[[File:2019 07 02 16 23 IMG 2649.jpg|left|thumb|Jewish [[Holocaust]] memorial "[[The Pit (memorial)|The Pit]]" in Minsk]]
The high mortality of the First World War and the Second World War affected the demographics of the city, particularly the destruction of Jews under the [[Nazism|Nazi]] occupation of the Second World War. Working through local populations, Germans instituted deportation of Jewish citizens to concentration camps, murdering most of them there. The Jewish community of Minsk suffered catastrophic losses in [[the Holocaust]]. From more than half the population of the city, the percentage of Jews dropped to less than 10% more than ten years after the war. After its limited population peaked in the 1970s, continuing anti-Semitism under the Soviet Union and increasing nationalism in Belarus caused most Jews to emigrate to Israel and western countries in the 1980s; by 1999, less than 1% of the population of Minsk was Jewish.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Institute for Jewish Policy Research: Belarus |url=https://www.jpr.org.uk/country?id=14 |access-date=2022-08-17 |website=www.jpr.org.uk}}</ref>

In the first three decades of the post-war years, the most numerous new residents in Minsk were rural migrants from other parts of Belarus; the proportion of ethnic [[Belarusians]] increased markedly. Numerous skilled [[Russians]] and other migrants from other parts of the [[Soviet Union]] migrated for jobs in the growing manufacturing sector.<ref name="Zimmerman 2004">Zimmerman (2004), ''Poles, Jews, and Politics''</ref> In 1959 Belarusians made up 63.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.8%), Jews (7.8%), Ukrainians (3.6%), Poles (1.1%) and [[Tatars]] (0.4%). Continued migration from rural Belarus in the 1960s and 1970s changed the ethnic composition further. By 1979 Belarusians made up 68.4% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups included Russians (22.2%), Jews (3.4%), Ukrainians (3.4%), Poles (1.2%) and Tatars (0.2%).<ref name="Zimmerman 2004" />

According to the 1989 census, 82% percent of Minsk residents have been born in Belarus. Of those, 43% have been born in Minsk and 39%&nbsp;– in other parts of Belarus. 6.2% of Minsk residents came from regions of western Belarus (Grodno and Brest Regions) and 13%&nbsp;– from eastern Belarus (Mogilev, Vitebsk and Gomel Regions). 21.4% of residents came from central Belarus (Minsk Region).{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

According to the 1999 census, Belarusians make up 79.3% of the city's residents. Other ethnic groups include Russians (15.7%), Ukrainians (2.4%), Poles (1.1%) and Jews (0.6%). The Russian and Ukrainian populations of Minsk peaked in the late 1980s (at 325,000 and 55,000 respectively). After the break-up of the [[Soviet Union]] many of them chose to move to their respective mother countries, although some families had been in Minsk for generations. Another factor in the shifting demographics of the city was the changing self-identification of Minsk residents of mixed ancestry – in independent Belarus they identify as Belarusians.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The [[Jewish population]] of Minsk peaked in the early 1970s at 50,000 according to official figures; independent estimates put the figure at between 100,000 and 120,000. Beginning in the 1980s, there has been mass-scale emigration to Israel, the US, and Germany. Today only about 10,000 Jews live in Minsk. The traditional minorities of Poles and Tatars have remained at much the same size (17,000 and 3,000 respectively). Rural Poles have migrated from the western part of Belarus to Minsk, and many Tatars have moved to Minsk from [[Tatarstan]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Some more recent [[minority group|ethnic minority]] communities have developed as a result of immigration. The most prominent are immigrants from the [[Caucasus]] countries – [[Armenians]], [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijanis]] and [[Georgians]] each numbering about 2,000 to 5,000. They began migrating to Minsk in the 1970s, and more immigrants have joined them since. Many work in the [[retailing|retail trade]] in open-air markets. A small but prominent Arab community has developed in Minsk, primarily represented by recent economic immigrants from [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Egypt]], [[Algeria]], etc. (In many cases, they are graduates of Minsk universities who decide to settle in Belarus and bring over their families). A small community of [[Romani people|Romani]], numbering about 2,000, are settled in suburbs of north-western and southern Minsk.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Initially most of its residents spoke [[Ruthenian language|Ruthenian]] (which later developed into modern [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]]). However, after 1569 the [[official language]] was [[Dialects of Polish#Northern Borderlands dialect|Polish]].<ref>Między Wschodem i Zachodem: international conference, Lublin, 18–21 June 1991</ref> In the 19th-century Russian became the official language and by the end of that century it had become the language of administration, schools and newspapers. The Belarusian national revival increased interest in the Belarusian language – its use has grown since the 1890s, especially among the [[intelligentsia]]. In the 1920s and early 1930s Belarusian was the major language of Minsk, including use for administration and education (both secondary and tertiary). However, since the late 1930s Russian again began gaining dominance.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

A short period of Belarusian national revival in the early 1990s saw a rise in the numbers of Belarusian speakers. However, in 1994 the newly elected president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] slowly reversed this trend. Most residents of Minsk now use Russian exclusively in their everyday lives at home and at work, although Belarusian is understood as well. Substantial numbers of recent migrants from the rural areas use [[Trasianka|Trasyanka]] (a Russo-Belarusian mixed language) in their everyday lives.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Liskovets |first=Irina |date=2009 |title=Trasjanka: A code of rural migrants in Minsk |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1367006909348678 |journal=International Journal of Bilingualism |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=396–412 |doi=10.1177/1367006909348678 |s2cid=144716155 |issn=1367-0069}}</ref>

=== Religion ===
There are no reliable statistics on the religious affiliations of those living in Minsk, or among the population of Belarus generally. The majority of Christians belong to the [[Belarusian Orthodox Church]], which is the exarchate of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in Belarus. There is a significant minority of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

== Economy ==
{{See also|Economy of Belarus}}

Minsk is the [[Capital city|economic capital]] of Belarus. It has developed industrial and services sectors which serve the needs not only of the city, but of the entire nation. Minsk's contributions form nearly 46% of Belarusian budget.<ref>{{cite web |script-title=ru:Четвертую часть поступлений в бюджет Минска обеспечили 5 плательщиков |trans-title=The fourth part of receipts in the budget of Minsk was provided by 5 payers |url=http://afn.by/news/i/131974 |website=afn.by |language=ru}}</ref> According to 2010 results, Minsk paid 15&nbsp;trillion BYR to state budget while the whole income from all other regions was 20&nbsp;trillion BYR.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bdg.by/news/finance/13645.html|title=Минск - основной плательщик НДС|date=26 January 2011|website=БДГ Деловая газета}}</ref> In the period January 2013 to October 2013, 70.6% of taxes in the budget of Minsk were paid by non-state enterprises, 26.3% by state enterprises, and 1.8% by individual entrepreneurs. Among the top 10 taxpayers were five oil and gas companies (including two [[Gazprom]]'s and one [[Lukoil]]'s subsidiaries), two mobile network operators ([[MTS (network provider)|MTS]] and [[A1 Belarus|A1]]), two companies producing alcoholic beverages (Minsk-Kristall and Minsk grape wines factory) and one producer of tobacco goods.<ref>{{cite web |date=18 November 2013 |title=73,7 % поступлений в консолидированный бюджет города Минска за 10 месяцев 2013 года обеспечено негосударственным сектором экономики. – Новости инспекции – Министерство по налогам и сборам Республики Беларусь |url=http://www.nalog.gov.by/ru/news_ministerstva_minsk_ru/view/737-postuplenij-v-konsolidirovannyj-bjudzhet-goroda-minska-za-10-mesjatsev-2013-goda-obespecheno-9443/ |website=nalog.gov.by}}</ref>

In 2012, [[Gross Regional Product]] of Minsk was formed mainly by industry (26.4%), wholesale (19.9%), transportation and communications (12.3%), retail (8.6%) and construction (5.8%).

GRP of Minsk measured in Belarusian rubles was 55 billion (€20 billion) or around 1/3 of Gross domestic product of Belarus.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.belstat.gov.by/upload-belstat/upload-belstat-excel/Oficial_statistika/2021/GDP_GRP-2112-en.xlsx |title = GRP of regions and Minsk city in 2021}}</ref>

=== Industry ===
[[File:3rd thermal power plant (Minsk) 07.jpg|thumb|Power plant]]
Minsk is the major industrial centre of Belarus. According to 2012 statistics, Minsk-based companies produced 21.5% of electricity, 76% of trucks, 15.9% of footwear, 89.3% of television sets, 99.3% of washing machines, 30% of chocolate, 27.7% of distilled alcoholic beverages and 19.7% of tobacco goods in Belarus.<ref>[http://belstat.gov.by/homep/en/indicators/regions/i2.php Shares of region and Minsk City in the national output of selected industrial products in 2012] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210152713/http://belstat.gov.by/homep/en/indicators/regions/i2.php |date=10 December 2013 }}</ref>

Today the city has over 250 factories and plants. Its industrial development started in the 1860s and was facilitated by the railways built in the 1870s. However, much of the industrial infrastructure was destroyed during World War I, especially during World War II. After the last war, the development of the city was linked to the development of industry, especially of [[Research and development|R&D]]-intensive sectors (heavy emphasis of R&D intensive industries in [[urban planning|urban development]] in the USSR is known in Western geography as 'Minsk phenomenon').{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Minsk was turned into a major production site for trucks, tractors, gears, optical equipment, refrigerators, television sets and radios, bicycles, motorcycles, watches, and metal-processing equipment. Outside machine-building and electronics, Minsk also had textiles, construction materials, food processing, and printing industries. During the Soviet period, the development of the industries was linked to suppliers and markets within the USSR. The break-up of the union in 1991 led to a serious economic meltdown in 1991–1994.<ref name="Intereconomics">{{cite journal |title=The Political Economy of the Belarusian Crisis |url=https://www.intereconomics.eu/contents/year/2020/number/5/article/the-political-economy-of-the-belarusian-crisis.html |journal=Intereconomics|year=2020 |volume=2020 |issue=5 |pages=274–275 |last1=Guriev |first1=Sergei |doi=10.1007/s10272-020-0913-1 |doi-access=free }}</ref>

However, since the adoption of the neo-Keynesean policies under [[Alexander Lukashenko]]'s government in 1995, much of the gross industrial production was regained.<ref name="Intereconomics"/> Unlike many other cities in the CIS and Eastern Europe, Minsk was not heavily de-industrialised in the 1990s. About 40% of the workforce is still employed in the [[Secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing sector]].<ref name="Intereconomics"/>

Major industrial employers include:
*[[Minsk Tractor Works|Minsk Tractor Plant]]&nbsp;– specialised in manufacturing tractors. Established in 1946 in eastern Minsk, is among major manufacturers of wheeled tractors in the CIS.

*Horizont&nbsp;– specialised in producing TV-sets, audio and video electronics. Established in 1950 in north-central Minsk.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

=== Unemployment ===
In 2011 official statistics quote unemployment in Minsk at 0.3%.<ref name="nav.2302">{{Cite web|url=http://naviny.by/rubrics/society/2011/02/23/ic_articles_116_172587/|title=Сколько реально безработных в Минске? &#124; naviny.by}}</ref> During the 2009 census 5.6% of Minsk residents of employable age called themselves unemployed.<ref name="nav.2302" />

=== Churches ===
*The [[Belarusian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] Cathedral of the Holy Spirit is actually the former church of the [[Cistercians|Bernardine]] convent. It was built in the simplified [[Baroque]] style in 1642–87 and went through renovations in 1741–46 and 1869.
*The [[Cathedral of Saint Virgin Mary|Cathedral of Saint Mary]] was built by the Jesuits as their principal church in 1700–10, restored in 1951 and 1997; it overlooks the recently restored 18th-century city hall, located on the other side of the Liberty Square;
*Two other historic churches are the cathedral of [[Saint Joseph]], formerly affiliated with the Bernardine monastery, built in 1644–52 and repaired in 1983, and the fortified church of Sts. Peter and Paul, originally built in the 1620s and recently restored, complete with its flanking twin towers.
*[[Church of St. Thomas Aquinas and the Dominican monastery in Minsk]] was a [[Catholic Church in Belarus|Catholic]] [[monastery]] complex founded in the early 17th century, destroyed in 1950. It was built in the [[Baroque]] style.
*The impressive Neo-Romanesque Roman Catholic [[Church of Saints Simon and Helena|Red Church]] (Cathedral of Sts. Simeon and Helene) was built in 1906–10 immediately after religious freedoms were proclaimed in Imperial Russia and the tsar allowed dissidents to build their churches;
*The largest church built in the Russian imperial period of the town's history is dedicated to St. [[Mary Magdalene]];
*[[Church of St. Adalbert and Benedictine monastery]] was a [[Roman Catholic]] monastic complex in Minsk originally belonging to the [[Benedictines|Benedictine]] order. Currently, the General Prosecutor's Office of Belarus is located on this site;
*Many Orthodox churches were built after the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|dissolution of the USSR]] in a variety of styles, although most remain true to the Neo-Russian idiom. A good example is St. Elisabeth's Convent, founded in 1999.

== Transportation ==

=== Local transport ===
Minsk has an extensive public transport system.<ref>{{cite web |date=4 October 2012 |title=Public transport in Minsk |url=http://www.apartmentinminsk.com/news-blog/public-transport.htm |access-date=4 October 2012 |publisher=D-Minsk}}</ref> Passengers are served by 8 tramway lines, over 70 [[Trolleybuses in Minsk|trolleybus lines]], 3 subway lines and over 100 bus lines. Trams were the first public transport used in Minsk (since 1892&nbsp;– the horse-tram, and since 1929&nbsp;– the electric tram). Public buses have been used in Minsk since 1924, and trolleybuses since 1952.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-10-31 |title=History |url=https://minsktrans.by/en/history.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201031145204/https://minsktrans.by/en/history.html |archive-date=2020-10-31  |access-date=2022-08-04 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F6xIEAAAQBAJ&dq=Minsk+trolleybuses+1952&pg=PA436 |title=Innovations and Traditions for Sustainable Development - Google Books |date=2021-10-16 |isbn=9783030788254 |accessdate=2022-02-26|last1=Filho |first1=Walter Leal |last2=Krasnov |first2=Eugene V. |last3=Gaeva |first3=Dara V. |publisher=Springer }}</ref>

All public transport is operated by Minsktrans, a government-owned and -funded transport [[Non-profit organisation|not-for-profit]] company. As of November 2021, Minsktrans used 1,322 buses (plus 93 electric buses), 744 trolleybuses and 135 tramway cars in Minsk.<ref>{{cite web |date= 5 November 2021 |title=Minsktrans received 450 new buses and trolleybuses |url=https://reform.by/274457-minsktrans-poluchil-450-avtobusov-i-trollejbusov |access-date=7 November 2021 |publisher=Reform.By}}</ref>

The Minsk city government in 2003 decreed that local transport provision should be set at a minimum level of 1 vehicle (bus, trolleybus or tram) per 1,500 residents. The number of vehicles in use by Minsktrans is 2.2 times higher than the minimum level. {{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

{{Main|Minsk Metro}}
Minsk is the only city in Belarus with an underground [[rapid transit|metro]] system. Construction of the metro began in 1977, soon after the city reached over a million people, and the first line with 8 stations was opened in 1984. Since then it has expanded into three lines: [[Maskoŭskaja Line|Maskoŭskaja]], [[Aŭtazavodskaja Line|Aŭtazavodskaja]], and [[Zelenaluzhskaya Line|Zielienalužskaja]] which are {{convert|19.1|, |18.1| and |3.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} long with 15, 14 and 4 stations, respectively. On 7 November 2012, three new stations on the Moskovskaya Line were opened and another on 3 June 2014.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}. Construction of the third line began in 2011 and the first stage opened in 2020. Some layout plans speculate on a possible fourth line running from Vyasnyanka to Serabranka micro-rayons.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

Trains use 243 standard Russian metro-cars. On a typical day Minsk metro is used by 800,000 passengers. In 2007 ridership of Minsk metro was 262.1&nbsp;million passengers,<ref>{{cite web |date=21 June 2010 |title=CIS Metro Statistics |url=http://www.mrl.ucsb.edu/~yopopov/rrt/maps/statistics.html |access-date=4 July 2010 |publisher=Mrl.ucsb.edu |archive-date=4 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804050310/http://www.mrl.ucsb.edu/~yopopov/rrt/maps/statistics.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> in 2017 ridership of Minsk metro was 284,1&nbsp;million passengers,<ref>{{cite web |date=2018 |title=Метро сегодня |url=http://metropoliten.by/o_metropolitene/metro_today |publisher=metropoliten.b}}</ref>
making it the 5th busiest metro network in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]] (behind Moscow, [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]], [[Kyiv]] and [[Kharkiv]]). During peak hours trains run each 2–2.5 minutes. The metro network employs 3,435 staff.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Minsk Metro |url=https://eng.asmetro.ru/metro/metro/minsk/minsk_full/ |access-date=2024-06-25 |website=International Metro Association}}</ref>

Most of the urban transport is being renovated to modern standards. For instance, all metro stations built since 2001 have passenger lifts from platform to street level, thus enabling the use of the newer stations by disabled passengers.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}<ref>{{cite web|date=|title=Minsk Metro|url=https://www.belarus.by/en/travel/transport-in-belarus/minsk-metro|access-date=26 June 2021|website=www.belarus.by}}</ref>

=== Railway and intercity bus ===

Minsk is the largest transport hub in Belarus. Minsk is located at the junction of the [[Warsaw]]-Moscow railway (built in 1871) running from the southwest to the northeast of the city and the [[Liepāja|Liepaja]]-[[Romny]] railway (built in 1873) running from the northwest to the south. The first railway connects Russia with Poland and Germany; the second connects Ukraine with Lithuania and Latvia. They cross at the [[Minsk Passazhirsky railway station|Minsk-''Pasažyrski'']] railway station, the main railway station of Minsk. The station was built in 1873 as Vilenski Vazkal. The initial wooden building was demolished in 1890 and rebuilt in stone. During World War II the Minsk railway station was completely destroyed. It was rebuilt in 1945 and 1946 and served until 1991. The new building of the Minsk-''Pasažyrski'' railway station was built during 1991–2002. Its construction was delayed due to financial difficulties; now, however, Minsk boasts one of the most modern and up-to-date railway stations in the CIS. There were plans to move all [[Regional rail|suburban rail]] traffic from Minsk-''Pasažyrski'' to the smaller stations, Minsk-''Uschodni'' (East), Minsk-''Paŭdniovy'' (South) and Minsk-''Paŭnočny'' (North), by 2020. However, those plans were scrapped in favour of developing a more integrated system of suburban rail (branded as City Lines, operated by Belarusian Railways state enterprise). The system currently consists of 3 routes (to stations Bielaruś, Čyrvony Ściah, Rudziensk) all terminating at the central train station and is being served by 6 Stadler FLIRT train sets. {{citation needed|date=July 2024}}

There is an intercity bus station that links Minsk with the nearby airport, with the suburbs and other cities in Belarus and the neighboring countries. There are frequent services to Moscow, [[Smolensk]], [[Vilnius]], [[Riga]] and [[Warsaw]].{{citation needed|date=July 2024}}
