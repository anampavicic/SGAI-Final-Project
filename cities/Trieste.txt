It is the capital and largest city of the [[Regions of Italy#Autonomous regions with special statute|autonomous region]] of [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], as well as of the [[Province of Trieste|regional decentralization entity of Trieste]].

Trieste is located at the head of the [[Gulf of Trieste]], on a narrow strip of Italian territory lying between the [[Adriatic Sea]] and [[Slovenia]]; Slovenia lies close, at approximately {{cvt|8|km|0}} east and {{cvt|10–15|km|0}} southeast of the city, while [[Croatia]] is about {{cvt|30|km|mi}} to the south of the city.

The city has a long coastline and is surrounded by grassland, forest, and [[karst]]ic areas. In 2022, it had a population of 204,302.<ref name="istat-population">{{cite web |date=2022 |title=Population of Trieste 2022 |url=https://www.aznations.com/population/it/cities/trieste |access-date=1 May 2022 |website=AZ Nations: World countries population |publisher=}}</ref>

Trieste belonged as '''Triest''' to the [[Habsburg monarchy]] from 1382 until 1918. In the 19th century, the monarchy was one of the [[Great Powers]] of Europe and Trieste was its most important seaport. As a prosperous trading hub in the [[Mediterranean]] region, Trieste grew to become the fourth largest city of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (after [[Vienna]], [[Budapest]], and [[Prague]]). At the turn of the 20th century, it emerged as an important hub for literature and music. Trieste underwent an economic revival during the 1930s, and the [[Free Territory of Trieste]] became a major site of the struggle between the [[Eastern Bloc|Eastern]] and [[Western Bloc|Western]] blocs after the [[Second World War]].

Trieste, a deep-water port, is a maritime gateway for northern Italy, [[Germany]], [[Austria]] and [[Central Europe]]. It is considered the end point of the maritime [[Silk Road]], with its connections to the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Turkey]]. Since the 1960s, Trieste has emerged as a prominent research location in Europe because of its many international organisations and institutions. The city lies at the intersection of [[Romance languages|Latin]], [[Slavs|Slavic]] and [[Culture of German-speaking Europe|Germanic]] cultures, where [[Central Europe]] meets the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and is home to diverse ethnic groups and religious communities.

A scholarly area, Trieste has the highest percentage of researchers, per capita, in Europe.<ref name="Trieste 2018">G. Bar "Trieste, è record europeo di ricercatori: 37 ogni mille abitanti. Più della Finlandia", In: il Fatto Quotidiano, 26 April 2018.</ref> {{lang|it|Città della Barcolana}} ("City of the [[Barcolana regatta|Barcolana]]"), {{lang|it|Città della bora}} ("City of the [[bora (wind)|bora]]"), {{lang|it|Città del vento}} ("City of Wind"), "Vienna by the sea" and "City of Coffee" are epithets used to describe Trieste.

The most likely origin is a Celtic word, ''Tergeste'' – with the ''-est-'' suffix typical of [[Venetic language|Venetic]] – and derived from the hypothetical [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] word ''*terg-'' "market" (etymologically cognate to the [[Albanian language|Albanian]] term {{Lang|sq|treg}} 'market, marketplace'<ref name="Vasmer1971" /> and reconstructed [[Proto-Slavic language|Proto-Slavic]] "*tъrgъ")<ref name="Vasmer1971">{{cite book |last=Vasmer |first=Max |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhuGAAAAIAAJ&q=+treg |title=Schriften zur slavischen Altertumskunde und Namenkunde |publisher=In Kommission bei O.

===Ancient history===
[[File:Arcoromano.jpg|thumb|[[Arco di Riccardo]], a Roman triumphal arch constructed from 33–32 BC]]
Since the second millennium BC, the location was an inhabited site. Originally an [[Illyria]]n settlement, the [[Adriatic Veneti|Veneti]] entered the region in the 10th–9th c. BC and seem to have given the town its name, ''Tergeste'', because ''terg*'' is a Venetic word meaning market (q.v. [[Oderzo]], whose ancient name was ''Opitergium''). Later, the town was captured by the [[Carni]], a tribe of the [[Eastern Alps]], before becoming part of the [[Roman republic]] in 177 BC during the [[Second Istrian War]].<ref>Bernardini, F., Vinci, G., Horvat, J., De Min, A., Forte, E., Furlani, S., Lenaz, D., Pipan, M., Zhao, W., Sgambati, A., Potleca, M., Micheli, R., Fragiacomo, A., & Tuniz, C. (2015). Early Roman military fortifications and the origin of Trieste, Italy. ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'', ''112''(13), E1520–E1529. {{JSTOR|26462435}}</ref>

After being attacked by barbarians from the interior in 52 BC,<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Tergeste|volume=26|page=641|first=Thomas|last=Ashby|author-link=Thomas Ashby (archaeologist)}}</ref> and until 46 BC, it was granted the status of Roman colony under [[Julius Caesar]], who recorded its name as ''Tergeste'' in ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' (51 BC), in which he recounts events of the [[Gallic Wars]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://la.wikisource.org/wiki/Commentarii_de_bello_Gallico/Liber_VIII#24 | title=Commentarii de bello Gallico/Liber VIII - Wikisource }}</ref>

During the imperial period the border of [[Roman Italy]] moved from the [[Timavo]] River to the Formione (today [[Rižana (river)|Risano]]). Roman Tergeste flourished due to its position on the road from [[Aquileia]], the main Roman city in the area, to [[Istria]], and as a port, some ruins of which are still visible. Emperor [[Augustus]] built a line of walls around the city in 33–32 BC, while [[Trajan]] built a theatre in the 2nd century. At the same time, the citizens of the town were enrolled in the tribe Pupinia. In 27 BC, Trieste was incorporated in ''Regio X'' of Augustan ''Italia''.<ref>Giulipaola Ruaro, ''Strolling Around Trieste'', (Trieste: Edizioni Fachin, 1986), 6</ref>

In the early Christian era Trieste continued to flourish. Between 138 and 161 AD, its territory was enlarged and nearby [[Carni]] and Catali were granted Roman citizenship by the Roman Senate and Emperor Antoninus Pius at the pleading of a leading Tergestine citizen, the ''quaestor urbanus'', Fabius Severus.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sul ius adipiscendae c.R. nel decreto tergestino in onore di L. Fabius Severus |url=https://flore.unifi.it/handle/2158/1191036 |access-date=2023-05-02 |website=flore.unifi.it}}</ref>

Already at the time of the Roman Empire there was a fishing village called Vallicula ("small valley") in the [[Barcola]] area. Remains of richly decorated Roman villas, including wellness facilities, piers and extensive gardens suggest that Barcola was already a place for relaxation among the Romans because of its favourable microclimate, as it was located directly on the sea and protected from the [[Bora (wind)|bora]]. At that time, [[Pliny the Elder]] mentioned the vines of the wine Pulcino ("Vinum Pucinum" – probably today's "Prosecco"), which were grown on the slopes.<ref name="Zeno Saracino 2018">Zeno Saracino: "Pompei in miniatura": la storia di "Vallicula" o Barcola. In: Trieste All News. 29 September 2018.</ref>

===Middle Ages===
In 788, Trieste submitted to [[Charlemagne]], who placed it under the authority of the [[Bishop of Trieste|count-bishop]] who in turn was subject to the Duke of [[Duchy of Friuli|Friùli]].{{cn|date=June 2024}}

During the 13th and 14th centuries, Trieste became a maritime trade rival to the [[Republic of Venice]], which briefly occupied it in 1283–87, before coming under the patronage of the Patriarchate of Aquileia.{{cn|date=September 2024}} After it committed a perceived offence against Venice, the Venetian State declared war against Trieste in July 1368 and by November had occupied the city. Venice intended to keep the city and began rebuilding its defences, but was forced to leave in 1372. Due to the Peace of Turin in 1381, Venice renounced its claim to Trieste and the leading citizens of Trieste petitioned [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria|Leopold III]] of [[Habsburg]], Duke of [[Duchy of Austria|Austria]], to annex Trieste to his domains. The agreement of voluntary submission (''dedizione'') was signed at the [[Schloßberg (Graz)|castle of Graz]] on 30 September 1382.<ref name="Thaller">{{cite journal|last1=Thaller|first1=Anja|title=Graz 1382 – Ein Wendepunkt der Triestiner Geschichte?|journal=Historisches Jahrbuch der Stadt Graz|date=2009|volume=38/39|pages=191–221|url=https://www.academia.edu/536492|access-date=6 May 2016|language=de}}</ref>

The city maintained a high degree of autonomy under the Habsburgs, but was increasingly losing ground as a trade hub, both to Venice and to [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]]. In 1463, a number of Istrian communities petitioned Venice to attack Trieste. Trieste was saved from utter ruin by the intervention of [[Pope Pius II]] who had previously been bishop of [[Bishopric of Trieste|Trieste]]. However, Venice limited Trieste's territory to {{convert|3|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} outside the city. Trieste would be assaulted again in 1468–1469 by Holy Roman [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]]. His sack of the city is remembered as the "Destruction of Trieste."<ref>Giulipaola Ruaro, ''Strolling Around Trieste'', (Trieste: Edizioni Fachin, 1986), 11</ref> He then restored the city walls for the fourth time.<ref name="EB1911"/> Trieste was fortunate to be spared another sack in 1470 by the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] who burned the village of [[Prosecco (Trieste)|Prosecco]], only about {{convert|5.3|mi|km|1|abbr=off}} from Trieste, while on their way to attack [[Friuli]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Centro di ricerche storiche Centar za povijesna istraživanja Središče za zgodovinska raziskovanja | website=CRS | url=https://crsrv.org/editoria/atti/atti-xxxi/antonio-miculian-le-incursioni-dei-turchi-e-le-fortezze-veneziane-in-friuli-e-in-istria-nel-quadro-dell-organizzazione-militare-di-terraferma-nel-xvi-secolo | language=it | access-date=12 August 2023}}</ref>

===Early modern period===
{{See also|Imperial Free City of Trieste}}
Following an unsuccessful Habsburg invasion of Venice in the prelude to the 1508–16 [[War of the League of Cambrai]], the Venetians occupied Trieste again in 1508, and were allowed to keep the city under the terms of the peace treaty.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} However, the [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Empire]] recovered Trieste a little over one year later, when the conflict resumed. By the 18th century Trieste became an important port and commercial hub for the Austrians.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}} In 1719, it was granted status as a [[free port]] within the Habsburg Empire by [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Charles VI]], and remained a free port until 1 July 1791. The reign of his successor, [[Maria Theresa of Austria]], marked the beginning of a very prosperous era for the city. [[Serbs]] settled Trieste largely in the 18th and 19th centuries, and they soon formed an influential and rich community within the city, as a number of Serbian traders came into ownership of many important businesses and built palaces across Trieste.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Kultura Srba u Trstu|last1=Perišić|first1=Miroslav|last2=Reljić|first2=Jelica|publisher=Arhiv Srbije|year=2016|location=Belgrade}}</ref>

===19th century===
[[File:Pividor La Riva Carciotti.jpg|thumb|Palazzo Carciotti in Trieste, {{circa|1850}}]]
In the following decades, Trieste was briefly occupied by troops of the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] on several occasions, in 1797, 1805 and 1809. From 1809 to 1813, Trieste was annexed into the [[Illyrian Provinces]], interrupting its status of free port and losing its autonomy. The municipal autonomy was not restored after the return of the city to the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1813. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Trieste continued to prosper as the [[Free Imperial City]] of Trieste ({{langx|de|[[Reichsunmittelbar]]e Stadt Triest}}), a status that granted economic freedom, but limited its political self-government. The city's role as Austria's main trading port and shipbuilding centre was later emphasised by the foundation of the merchant shipping line [[Österreichischer Lloyd|Austrian Lloyd]] in 1836, whose headquarters stood at the corner of the Piazza Grande and Sanità (today's [[Piazza Unità d'Italia]]). By 1913, Austrian Lloyd had a fleet of 62 ships totalling 236,000 tonnes.<ref>Hubmann, Franz, & Wheatcroft, Andrew (editor), ''The Habsburg Empire, 1840–1916'', London, 1972, {{ISBN|0-7100-7230-9}}</ref> With the introduction of [[constitutionalism]] in the Austrian Empire in 1860, the municipal autonomy of the city was restored, with Trieste becoming capital of the [[Austrian Littoral]] crown land ({{langx|de|Österreichisches Küstenland}}).
[[File:Borsa1854.jpg|thumb|right|The Stock Exchange Square in 1854]]
[[File:Stock market in Triest today.JPG|thumb|Stock market in Trieste today]]
With anti-clericalism on the rise in the rest of the Italian peninsula due to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardina's bellicose policies towards the church and its estates, [[Pope Leo XIII]] at times considered moving his residence to Trieste or [[Salzburg]]. However, [[Emperor Franz Joseph]] rejected the idea.<ref>Josef Schmidlin, ''Papstgeschichte der neueren Zeit,'' München, 1934, p.414</ref> Trieste, along with Rijeka (Fiume), served as an important base for the [[Imperial and Royal Navy|Imperial-Royal Navy]], which in the first decade of the 20th century embarked on a major modernisation programme. With the construction of the [[Austrian Southern Railway]], the first major railway in the Empire, in 1857, Trieste acquired a significant role in the trade of coal. 
 [[File:Triest 1885.jpg|thumb|right|A view of Trieste in 1885]]
Trieste had long been home to Italian irredentist sentiment, as evidenced by the activity at {{ill|Caffè Tommaseo|it|Caffè Tommaseo|de|Caffè Tommaseo}}.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ruaro |first=Giuliapaola |title=Triest, 3. |year=2005}}</ref> In 1882 this fervour culminated in an attempted assassination of Emperor Franz Joseph at the hands of Wilhem Oberdank ([[Guglielmo Oberdan]]), while His Majesty was visiting the city. The perpetrator was arrested, tried, found guilty and ultimately sentenced to death. His legacy was regarded as worthy of martyrdom status by fellow irredentists, while monarchical elements regarded his actions as ignominious. The Emperor, who went on to reign for thirty-four more years, never again visited Trieste.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-03-14 |title=City of Trieste |url=https://mahlerfoundation.org/mahler/locations/italy/trieste/city-of-trieste/ |access-date=2023-05-07 |website=Mahler Foundation |language=en-US}}</ref>

===20th century===
At the beginning of the 20th century, Trieste was a bustling cosmopolitan city frequented by artists and philosophers such as [[James Joyce]], [[Italo Svevo]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Zofka Kveder]], [[Dragotin Kette]], [[Ivan Cankar]], [[Scipio Slataper]], and [[Umberto Saba]].{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} The city was the major port on the [[Austrian Riviera]].{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

===World War I, annexation to Italy and Fascist era===
{{See also|Battles of the Isonzo|Julian March}}

Italy, in return for entering [[World War I]] on the side of the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]], had been promised substantial territorial gains, which included the former [[Austrian Littoral]] and western [[Inner Carniola]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gspi.unipr.it/sites/st26/files/allegatiparagrafo/25-01-2016/treaty_of_london_1.pdf|title=The Treaty of London was signed on April 26, 1915|access-date=December 22, 2023}}</ref> Italy therefore annexed the city of Trieste at the end of the war, in accordance with the provisions of the 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and the Italian-Yugoslav 1920 [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Federzoni |first=Luigi |title=IL TRATTATO DI RAPALLO CON UN'APPENDICE DI DOCUMENTI |publisher=[[Zanichelli]] |location=Bologna |pages=295–300 |language=it}}</ref>

In the late 1920s, following Italian fascists burning down of the Slovene cultural centre in July 1920, the Slovene [[militant anti-fascist]] organisation [[TIGR]] carried out several bomb attacks in the city centre. In 1930 and 1941, two trials of Slovene activists were held in Trieste by the fascist Special Tribunal for the Security of the State. During the 1920s and 1930s, several monumental buildings were built in the [[Fascist architecture|Fascist architectural style]], including the [[University of Trieste]] and the almost {{convert|70|m|2|abbr=on}} tall [[Vittoria Light|Victory Lighthouse]] (Faro della Vittoria), which became a city landmark. The economy improved in the late 1930s, and several large infrastructure projects were carried out.<ref>Angelo Ara, Claudio Magris. ''Trieste. Un'identità di frontiera''. p.56</ref>

===World War II and aftermath===

Following the [[Slovene Lands in World War II|trisection]] of Slovenia, starting from the winter of 1941, the first [[Slovene Partisans]] appeared in Trieste province, although the resistance movement did not become active in the city itself until late 1943.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Novak |first=Bogdan |title=Trieste, 1941-1954 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1970 |location=United States of America |pages=59–62 |language=en}}</ref>

After the [[Italian armistice]] in September 1943, the city was occupied by [[Wehrmacht|Wehrmacht troops]]. Trieste became nominally part of the newly constituted [[Italian Social Republic]], but it was de facto ruled by Germany, who created the [[Operation Zone of the Adriatic Littoral]] (OZAK) out of former Italian north-eastern regions, with Trieste as the administrative centre. The new administrative entity was headed by [[Friedrich Rainer]], Gauleiter of Carinthia, named supreme commissary of the AK zone. A semblance of indigenous Italian rule was kept in the form of Cesare Pagnini, mayor of Trieste, but every civil official was assigned a representative of the supreme commissar in the form of a Deutsche Berater (German Adviser).<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Novak |first=Bogdan |title=Trieste, 1941-1954 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1970 |location=United States of America |pages=72 |language=en}}</ref> Under German occupation, the only [[concentration camp]] with a crematorium on Italian soil was built in a suburb of Trieste, at the [[Risiera di San Sabba]] on 4 April 1944. From 20 October 1943, to the spring of 1944, around 25,000 Jews and partisans were interrogated and tortured in the Risiera. Three to four thousand of them were murdered here by shooting, beating or in gas vans.

The city saw intense Italian and Yugoslav [[partisan (military)|partisan]] activity and suffered from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombings, over 20 air raids in 1944–1945, targeting the oil refineries, port and marshalling yard but causing considerable collateral damage to the city and 651 deaths among the population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://biografiadiunabomba.anvcg.it/trieste-sotto-le-bombe-il-10-giugno-1944/|title=Trieste sotto le bombe il 10 giugno 1944 &#124; Biografia di una bomba &#124; Il blog di Giovanni Lafirenze}}</ref> The worst raid took place on 10 June 1944, when a hundred tons of bombs dropped by 40 [[USAAF]] bombers, targeting the oil refineries, resulted in the destruction of 250 buildings, damage to another 700 and 463 victims.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/trieste/cronaca/2014/06/14/news/cosi-il-10-giugno-44-trieste-si-sveglio-sotto-le-bombe-1.9423562|title=Così il 10 giugno '44 Trieste si svegliò sotto le bombe|date=June 14, 2014|website=Il Piccolo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.triesteallnews.it/2019/06/ricordo-del-bombardamento-di-san-giacomo-10-giugno-1944-2019/|title=Ricordo del bombardamento di San Giacomo: 10 giugno 1944-2019 - TRIESTE.news|first=Zeno|last=Saracino|date=June 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.comunicarte.info/blog/2016/10-giugno-1944-bombe-su-trieste/|title=Comunicarte Edizioni » 10 giugno 1944: bombe su Trieste}}</ref>

====Occupation by Yugoslav partisans====
[[File:StampTrieste1945Michel18.jpg|thumb|150px|A postage stamp issued by the [[Italian Social Republic]] with a Yugoslav liberation [[overprint]]]]
On 30 April 1945, the Slovenian and Italian [[anti-Fascist]] [[Liberation Front of the Slovene Nation|Osvobodilna fronta]] (OF) and National Liberation Committee ([[Comitato di Liberazione Nazionale]], or CLN) of Edoardo Marzari and [[Antonio Fonda Savio]], made up of approximately 3,500 volunteers, incited a riot against the Nazi occupiers. On 1 May [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] members of the [[Yugoslav Partisans]]' [[8th Dalmatian Corps (Partisans)|8th Dalmatian Corps]] took over most of the city, except for the courts and the castle of San Giusto, where the German garrisons refused to surrender to anyone but the New Zealanders, due to the partisans' reputation for shooting German and Italian prisoners of war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cadmus.iue.it/dspace/bitstream/1814/2599/1/HEC04-01.pdf|title=The Expulsion of the 'German' Communities from Eastern Europe at the End of the Second World War|editor-last1=Prauser|editor-first1=Steffen|editor-last2=Rees|editor-first2=Arfon|publisher=[[European University Institute]]|publication-place=Italy|date=December 2004|language=en|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001022039/http://cadmus.iue.it/dspace/bitstream/1814/2599/1/HEC04-01.pdf|archive-date=October 1, 2009|access-date=December 22, 2023}}</ref> The [[2nd New Zealand Division]] under General [[Bernard Freyberg, 1st Baron Freyberg|Freyberg]] continued to advance towards Trieste along Route 14 around the northern coast of the Adriatic sea and arrived in the city the following day (see official histories ''The Italian Campaign''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/war/the-italian-campaign/faenza-trieste |title=Faenza, Trieste and home – the Italian campaign &#124; NZHistory, New Zealand history online |publisher=Nzhistory.net.nz |date=2012-12-20 |access-date=2013-03-12}}</ref> and ''Through the Venetian Line'').<ref>{{cite web|author=Kay, Robin |url=https://nzetc.victoria.ac.nz/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2-2Ita-c11-4.html |title=IV: Through the Venetian Line |publisher=NZETC |access-date=2013-03-12}}</ref> The German forces surrendered on the evening of 2 May, but were then turned over to the Yugoslav forces.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Picamus |first=Daniela |date=2018 |title=Trieste 1945.

==== A city in limbo (1945–1947) ====
After an agreement between the Yugoslav leader [[Josip Broz Tito]] and Field Marshal Alexander, the Yugoslav forces withdrew from Trieste, which came under a joint British-U.S. military administration.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Novak |first=Bogdan |title=Trieste, 1941-1954 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1970 |location=United States of America |pages=196–198 |language=en}}</ref> The Julian March was divided by the [[Morgan Line]] between Anglo-American and Yugoslav military administration until September 1947 when the [[Paris Peace Treaty]] established the [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. The effective turning point for Trieste's fortunes had already been established, though: President Truman's stipulations, later named the Truman Doctrine, in all but name had sealed the status quo, formalised only in the above-mentioned treaty, one that proved to be a careful balancing act between Yugoslav demands, Italian claims and international aims toward the Adriatic gulf and Eastern Europe in general. Questions arose on the structure of government as soon and even earlier than the signing of the treaty, with neither Italy nor Yugoslavia willing to recognise a joint governor.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Novak |first=Bogdan |title=Trieste, 1941-1954 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1970 |location=United States of America |pages=279–280 |language=en}}</ref> Initially, the newly established Allied Military Government (AMG) found it difficult to exercise its authority over the newly administered territories (the Italian majority provinces of Trieste, Gorizia and Pola), because of a rooted communist presence, especially in the countryside. This state of affairs did not change until a formal peace treaty with Italy had been signed, granting the AMG the full powers to administer justice and re-establish law and order in those areas under its administration. Replacing the People's Militia, the AMG recruited a civilian police force from the indigenous population along the Anglo-Saxon police model. This exercise of jurisdiction was thus articulated: pursuant to Proclamation No. 1, three tiers of tribunals were established: the Summary Military Courts, with jurisdiction over petty crime, the Superior Military Courts, which could impose punishments not exceeding 10 years imprisonment, and the General Military Court, which could impose the death penalty. Civil courts, as modelled on the Kingdom of Italy's code, were, pursuant to General Order No. 6, re-established July 12, 1945 but the slovene minority was given the right to be heard, and for proceedings to be, in their own language.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Novak |first=Bogdan |title=Trieste, 1941-1954 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year=1970 |location=United States of America |pages=214 |language=en}}</ref>

===Zone A of the Free Territory of Trieste (1947–54)===
{{Main| Free Territory of Trieste}}
[[File:Free Territory of Trieste Map.svg|thumb|upright|left|Trieste and Zone A/B]]
In 1947, Trieste was declared an independent [[city state]] under the protection of the [[United Nations]] as the [[Free Territory of Trieste]]. The territory was divided into two zones, A and B, along the [[Morgan Line]] established in 1945.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000258341.pdf|title=The Current Situation in the Free Territory of Trieste|publisher=CIA|year=1948|access-date=21 June 2014|archive-date=17 July 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717211341/http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000258341.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

From 1947 to 1954, Zone A was occupied and governed by the [[Allied Military Government for Occupied Territories|Allied Military Government]], composed of the American [[Trieste United States Troops]] (TRUST), commanded by Major General [[Bryant Moore|Bryant E. Moore]], the commanding general of the American [[88th Infantry Division (United States)|88th Infantry Division]], and the "British Element Trieste Forces" (BETFOR),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.milhist.net/betfor/ordbat.html|title=British Element Trieste Forces – Order of Battle|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref> commanded by Sir [[Terence Airey]], who were the joint forces commander and also the military governors.
[[File:Trieste 1954.jpg|thumb|Cheering crowd for the return of Trieste to Italy on November 4, 1954]]
Zone A covered almost the same area of the current Italian Province of Trieste, except for four small villages south of [[Muggia]] (see below), which were given to Yugoslavia after the dissolution (see [[London Memorandum of 1954]]) of the Free Territory in 1954. Occupied Zone B, which was under the administration of [[Miloš Stamatović]], then a colonel in the [[Yugoslav People's Army]], was composed of the north-westernmost portion of the Istrian peninsula, between the [[Mirna River (Croatia)|Mirna River]] and the cape [[Debeli Rtič]].{{cn|date=September 2024}}

In 1954, in accordance with the Memorandum of London, the vast majority of Zone A—including the city of Trieste—joined Italy, whereas Zone B and four villages from Zone A ([[Plavje]], [[Spodnje Škofije]], [[Hrvatini]], and [[Elerji]]) became part of Yugoslavia, divided between [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]. The final border line with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and the status of the ethnic minorities in the areas was settled bilaterally in 1975 with the [[Treaty of Osimo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.inps.it/docallegatiNP/Mig/Allegati/459Ex_Jugoslavia_Trattato_Osimo.pdf|title=Trattato tra la Repubblica Italiana e la Repubblica Socialista|website=inps.it|language=it|access-date=7 June 2023}}</ref> This line now constitutes the border between Italy and Slovenia.

==Geography==
Trieste is located in the northernmost part of the high [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]], in northeastern Italy, near the border with [[Slovenia]]. The city lies on the Gulf of Trieste. Built mostly on a hillside, Trieste's urban territory lies at the foot of an imposing escarpment that comes down abruptly from the [[Karst Plateau]] towards the sea. The karst hills delimiting the city reach an elevation of {{convert|458|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. It lies at the junction point of the Italian geographical region, the [[Balkan Peninsula]], and [[Mitteleuropa|Mitteleuropan Area]].

===Climate===
[[File:Trieste (28766391880).jpg|thumb|View of Trieste]]
Trieste's climate is [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Cf''), with cool winters and hot summers. On average, relative humidity is low (~ 65%), while only three months (January, March and July) receive slightly less than {{convert|60|mm|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation.

Trieste, like the Istrian Peninsula, has evenly distributed rainfall above {{convert|900|mm|0|abbr=on}} in total; it is noteworthy that no true summer drought occurs. [[Snow]] occurs on average 2 days per year.<ref name=RLigure>{{cite journal|author1=Roberto Pedemonte|title=La neve sulle coste del Maditerraneo (seconda parte)|journal=Rivista Ligure|date=May 2012|volume=12|issue=44|url=http://www.nimbus.it/liguria/rlm44/neve_mediterraneo.htm|access-date=28 June 2014|location=Genova|language=it}}</ref>

Winter highs are lower than the average temperatures in the Mediterranean zone. Two basic weather patterns alternate — sunny, windy and often cold days frequently caused a northeastern wind called bora, and rainy days with temperatures of about {{convert|6|to|11|C|F|0}}. 

Summer is very warm with highs of about {{convert|29|C|F}} and lows above {{convert|20|C|F}}, with hot nights being influenced by the warm sea water. The highest temperature of the last 30 years is {{convert|40.1|C|0|abbr=on}} in 2020, whereas the absolute minimum was {{convert|-7.9|C|0|abbr=on}} in 1996.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

The Trieste area is divided into 8a–10a zones according to USDA hardiness zoning; Villa Opicina (320 to 420 MSL), with an 8a zone in the upper suburban area down to a 10a zone in the shielded and windproof valleys close to the Adriatic sea.

The climate can be severely affected by the [[Bora (wind)|bora]], a very dry and usually cool north-to-northeast [[katabatic wind]] that can last for some days and reach speeds of up to {{convert|140|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on the piers of the port, thus sometimes lowering temperatures to subzero levels.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://triestetimes.com/bora-and-ice-2012/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051850/http://triestetimes.com/bora-and-ice-2012/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 March 2016 |title=Bora and Ice |publisher=The Trieste Times |access-date=20 May 2015 }}</ref>

==Economy==
During the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] era, Trieste became a leading European city in economy, trade and commerce, and was the fourth-largest and most important centre in the empire, after Vienna, Budapest and Prague. The economy of Trieste, however, fell into decline after the city's annexation to Italy in 1922. The Fascist government promoted several development schemes in the 1930s, with new manufacturing activities dedicated to shipbuilding and defence production (such as the "Cantieri Aeronautici Navali Triestini (CANT)").<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.nuovolitorale.org/cantieristica.asp | title=La Cantieristica Triestina | access-date=29 December 2012 | trans-title=Trieste naval industries | language=it | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306160025/http://www.nuovolitorale.org/cantieristica.asp | archive-date=6 March 2012 | url-status=dead | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Allied bombings during [[World War II]] destroyed the industrial section of the city (mainly the shipyards). However, starting from the 1970s, Trieste has experienced steady economic growth.
[[File:Porto nuovo di Trieste 1.4.2012.jpg|500px|thumb|Port of Trieste]]
Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, the accession of Slovenia, Croatia, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia to the EU and the increasing importance of the maritime [[Silk Road]] to Asia and Africa across the [[Suez Canal]], trade has seen an increase in Trieste.<ref>Harry de Wilt: Is One Belt, One Road a China crisis for North Sea main ports?, In: World Cargo News 17 December 2019.</ref><ref>Wolf D.

[[File:Illy Kaffeesack.jpg|200px|thumb|One of many coffee sacks that are traded by a Trieste company]]
The thriving coffee industry in Trieste began under [[Austria-Hungary]], with the Austro-Hungarian government even awarding tax-free status to the city in order to encourage more commerce. Some evidence of Austria-Hungary's coffee-driven economic growth stimulus remain, such as the Hausbrandt Trieste coffee company. As a result, present-day Trieste is characterised by its many cafes, and is still known to this day as "the coffee capital of Italy". Companies active in the coffee sector have given birth to the Trieste Coffee Cluster as their main umbrella organisation, but also as an economic actor in its own right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.triestecoffeecluster.com/index.php?lang=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123123341/http://www.triestecoffeecluster.com/index.php?lang=en|url-status=dead|archive-date=23 January 2012|title=Trieste Coffee Cluster|access-date=16 September 2015}}</ref> A large part of Italian coffee imports (approx. 2–2.5 million sacks) are handled and processed in the city.<ref>Helmut Luther "Warum Kaffeetrinken in Triest anspruchsvoll ist" In: Die Welt, 16 February 2015.</ref>

Two [[Fortune Global 500]] companies have their global or national headquarters in the city, respectively: [[Assicurazioni Generali]] and [[Allianz]]. Other corporations based in Trieste are [[Fincantieri]], one of the world's leading shipbuilding companies, and the Italian operations of [[Wärtsilä]]. Prominent companies from Trieste include: AcegasApsAmga ([[Hera Group]]), Adriatic Assicurazioni SpA Autamarocchi SpA, [[Banca Generali]] SpA (BIT: BGN), [[Genertel]], [[Genertellife]], HERA Trading, [[Illy]], [[Italia Marittima]], [[Modiano (company)|Modiano]], Nuovo Arsenale Cartubi Srl, [[Jindal Steel and Power]] Italia SpA; Pacorini SpA, Siderurgica Triestina (Arvedi Group), TBS Groug, [[U-blox]], [[Telit]], and polling and marketing company [[SWG (company)|SWG]].

The real estate market in Trieste has been growing in recent years. The relevant land register law comes from old Austrian legislation and was adopted by the Italian legal system after 1918 in Trieste, as well as in the provinces of Trento, Bolzano and Gorizia as well as in some municipalities of the provinces of Udine, Brescia, Belluno and Vicenza.<ref>Alessandra Caparello "Immobiliare: prezzi delle case in calo anche nel 2019 a -2,8%", Wall Street Italia, 30.

===Commercial fishing===
[[File:Fishing boat at Barcola.JPG|thumb|Professional fisherman's boat in [[Barcola]], a suburb of Trieste]]
Fishing boats anchor at Molo Veneziano near Piazza Venezia. In summer {{lang|it|lampare}} (large lamps) are used for fishing and in autumn and winter {{lang|it|redi di posta}} (smaller fishing nets) are used. In the [[Gulf of Trieste]], because of the crystal-clear, nutrient-poor water with little plankton, fishing in itself is challenging. The fishing season lasts from May to July. In terms of fish reproduction, fishing is prohibited in August and restricted in winter. As of 2009, there are fewer than 200 professional fishermen in the city. There is also a small fishing port in the suburb [[Barcola]]. Some of the fish is sold directly from the boats or delivered to the town's shops and restaurants. The rare alici ([anchovies - in the local dialect: {{lang|it|Sardoni barcolani}}) from the Gulf of Trieste near Barcola, which are only caught at Sirocco, are particularly sought after because of their white meat and special taste and fetch high prices for fishermen.<ref name="Servus Magazin 2020 p 73">Georges Desrues "Eine Lange Nacht am Meer", In: Triest - Servus Magazin (2020), p 73.</ref><ref>Ute Mörtl "Das immer kargere Leben der Fischer im Golf von Triest" In: Der Standard, 26.

==Education and research==
[[File:UniversitaTrieste.jpg|200px|thumb|The University of Trieste]]
The [[University of Trieste]], founded in 1924, is a medium-size state-supported institution with 12 faculties. It currently has about 23,000 students enrolled and 1,000 professors.
Trieste also hosts the [[Scuola Internazionale Superiore di Studi Avanzati]] ([[SISSA]]), a leading graduate and postgraduate teaching and research institution in the study of mathematics, theoretical physics, and neuroscience, and the [[MIB School of Management Trieste]].

There are three international schools offering primary and secondary education programmes in English in the greater metropolitan area: the International School of Trieste, the European School of Trieste, and the [[United World College of the Adriatic]] located in the nearby village of [[Duino]].

[[File:International Centre for Theoretical Physics.svg|200px|thumb|Research institutions such as the International Center for Theoretical Physics (logo), SISSA and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics are located in Trieste around Barcola.]]
The city also hosts numerous national and international scientific research organizations: 
* [[AREA Science Park]],
* [[ELETTRA]], a synchrotron particle accelerator with free-electron laser capabilities for research and industrial applications, 
* [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]], which operates under a tripartite agreement among the Italian Government, UNESCO, and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA),
* [[Trieste Astronomical Observatory]], 
* [[Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e Geofisica Sperimentale]] (OGS), which carries out research on oceans and geophysics;

* Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare (Italian National Institute for Nuclear Physics), 
* Laboratorio di Biologia Marina,
* Laboratory TASC Technology and Nano Science,
* [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Trieste]], [[Civico Orto Botanico di Trieste]].

Trieste is also a hub for corporate training and skills development, hosting, among others, Generali's Generali Academy and Illy's Università del Caffé. This competence centre was created in 1999 to spread the culture of quality coffee through training all over the world and to carry out research and innovation.<ref>Almut Siefert "Zu Besuch in der Kaffee-Universität in Triest. Eine Bohne kann alles verderben." In: Stuttgarter Zeitung, 27 September 2019.</ref>

As a result of the combination of research, business and funding, there are a growing number of spin-off companies in Trieste (partnerships in the production world exist with companies such as Cimolai, Danieli, Eni, Fincantieri, Generali, Illy, Mitsubishi, Vodafone) and proportionally the highest number of start-ups in Italy, the city also being referred to as Italy's Silicon Valley.<ref>Fabrizio Somma: Trieste – Dall’Emporio al Futuro. 2009, p 266.</ref><ref>Filippo Santelli: Start up, sono Trento e Trieste le capitali dell'innovazione.

{{as of|2020}}, there were 200,609 people residing in Trieste, located in the province of Trieste, [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]], of whom 48.1% were male and 51.9% were female.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}} Trieste has lost roughly ⅓ of its population since the 1970s, due to economic decline in the historical industrial sectors of steel and shipbuilding, a dramatic drop in fertility rates and fast population ageing. Minors (children aged 18 and younger) totalled 13.25% of the population compared to pensioners, who make up 27.9% of the total. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners).{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

The average age of Trieste residents is 46, compared to the Italian average of 42. In the five years between 2002 and 2007, the population of Trieste declined by 3.5%, and Italy as a whole grew by 3.85%.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}} However, in recent times, the city has shown signs of stabilising thanks to growing immigration.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}

Since the annexation to Italy after World War I, there has been a steady decline in Trieste's demographic weight compared to other cities. In 1911, Trieste was the 4th largest city in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (3rd largest in [[Cisleithania|the Austrian part of the Monarchy]]). In 1921, Trieste was the 8th largest city in the country,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=censimento1921|title=Il censimento del 1921|access-date=16 September 2015|archive-date=6 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506043149/http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=censimento1921|url-status=dead}}</ref> in 1961 the 12th largest,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=censimento1961|title=Il censimento del 1961|access-date=16 September 2015|archive-date=6 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506074339/http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=censimento1961|url-status=dead}}</ref> in 1981 the 14th largest,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=censimento1981|title=Il censimento del 1981|access-date=16 September 2015|archive-date=6 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506101502/http://cinquantamila.corriere.it/storyTellerThread.php?threadId=censimento1981|url-status=dead}}</ref> while in 2011 it dropped to the 15th place.

At the end of 2020, [[Istituto Nazionale di Statistica|ISTAT]] estimated that there were 22,839 foreign-born residents in Trieste, representing 11.38% of the total city population. The largest autochthonous minorities are Slovenes, Croats and Serbs,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraf.rs/zanimljivosti/zabavnik/2979662-kad-je-trst-bio-nas-evo-koje-srpske-porodice-su-zivele-u-ovom-gradu-i-to-u-najlepsim-vilama-foto|title=Kad je Trst bio naš: Evo koje srpske porodice su živele u ovom gradu i to u najlepšim vilama (FOTO)|website=Telegraf.rs|date=31 July 2018 |language=sr|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref> but there is also a large immigrant group from Balkan nations (particularly Serbia, Romania and Croatia): 4.95%, Asia: 0.52%, and sub-saharan Africa: 0.2%.

==Language==
[[File:WIKITONGUES- Arlon speaking Triestine.webm|thumb|A Triestine speaker]]
The particular dialect of Trieste, called tergestino, spoken until the beginning of the 19th century, was surpassed in relevance by the [[Triestine dialect]] of [[Venetian language|Venetian]] (a language deriving directly from [[Vulgar Latin]]) and other languages, including standard [[Italian language|Italian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], and [[German language|German]]. While Triestine and Italian were spoken by the largest part of the population, German was the language of the Austrian bureaucracy and Slovene was predominantly spoken in the surrounding villages. From the last decades of the 19th century, the number of speakers of Slovene grew steadily, reaching 25% of the overall population of Trieste in 1911.<ref name="ReferenceA">Stranj, Pavel, ''Slovensko prebivalstvo Furlanije-Julijske krajine v družbeni in zgodovinski perspektivi'', Trst, 1999</ref>

According to the 1911 census, the proportion of Slovene speakers grew to 12.6% in the city centre (15.9% counting only Austrian citizens), 47.6% in the suburbs (53% counting only Austrian citizens), and 90.5% in the surroundings.<ref name="Oesterreichischen Laender 1918">Spezialortsrepertorium der Oesterreichischen Laender. VII. Oesterreichisch-Illyrisches Kuestenland. Wien, 1918, Verlag der K.K. Hof- und Staatsdruckerei</ref> They were the largest ethnic group in nine of the nineteen urban neighbourhoods of Trieste, and represented a majority in seven of them.<ref name="Oesterreichischen Laender 1918"/> The Italian speakers, on the other hand, made up 60.1% of the population in the city centre, 38.1% in the suburbs, and 6.0% in the surroundings. They were the largest linguistic group in ten of the nineteen urban neighbourhoods, and represented the majority in seven of them (including all six in the city centre). German speakers amounted to 5% of the city's population, with the highest proportions in the city centre.

The city also had several other smaller ethnic communities, including Croats, Czechs, [[Istro-Romanians]], Serbs and Greeks, who mostly assimilated either into the Italian or the Slovene-speaking communities. Altogether, in 1911, 51.83% of the population of the municipality of Trieste spoke Italian, 24.79% spoke Slovene, 5.2% spoke German, 1% spoke Croatian, 0.3% spoke "other languages", and 16.8% were foreigners, including a further 12.9% Italians (immigrants from the Kingdom of Italy and thus considered separately from Triestine Italians) and 1.6% Hungarians.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kozina.com/premik/1910-02.pdf |title=The 1911 census |access-date=2019-08-28 |archive-date=2013-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220202023/http://www.kozina.com/premik/1910-02.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

By 1971, following the emigration of Slovenes to neighbouring Slovenia and the immigration of Italians from other regions ([[Istrian exodus|and from Yugoslav-annexed Istria]]) to Trieste, the percentage of Italian speakers had risen to 91.8%, and that of Slovenian speakers had dwindled to 5.7%.<ref>Pavel Stranj, ''La comunità sommersa'', Založba tržaškega tiska, Trieste/Trst 1992</ref>

Today, the dominant local dialect of Trieste is "Triestine" (''triestin'', pronounced {{IPA|vec|tɾi.esˈtiŋ|}}), a form of [[Venetian language|Venetian]]. This dialect and official Italian are spoken in the city, while Slovene is spoken in some of the immediate suburbs.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> There are also small numbers of Serbo-Croatian, German, Greek, and Hungarian speakers.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

====Castello Miramare (Miramare Castle)====
The Castello Miramare, or Miramare Castle, on the waterfront {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=off}} from Trieste, was built between 1856 and 1860 in a project by [[Carl Junker]], commissioned by [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Maximilian]]. The castle gardens comprise a variety of trees, chosen by and planted on the orders of Maximilian.<ref>{{cite book|first=Gabriele|last=Crozzoli|page=148|title=Miramare. Il Parco ed di Massimilianoil Castello|year=2004|publisher=Vianello |isbn=88-7200-153-6}}</ref> Features of the gardens include two ponds, one noted for its swans and the other for lotus flowers, the castle dependance ("Castelletto"), a bronze statue of Maximilian, and a small chapel where a cross made from the remains of the "Novara" is kept, the flagship on which Maximilian, brother of Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Josef]], set sail to become [[Second Mexican Empire|Emperor of Mexico]].

During the 1930s, the castle was also the home of [[Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta]], the last commander of Italian forces in East Africa during the Second World War. During the period of the application of the Instrument for the Provisional Regime of the Free Territory of Trieste, as established in the Treaty of Peace with Italy (Paris 10/02/1947), the castle served as headquarters for the United States Army's [[Trieste United States Troops|TRUST]] force.

====Castel San Giusto====
The Castel San Giusto, or Castle of San Giusto, was built upon the remains of previous castles on the site and took almost two centuries to build. The stages of the development of the castle's defensive structures are marked by the following periods: the central part built, under [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1470–1), the round Venetian bastion (1508–9), the Hoyos-Lalio bastion and the Pomis, or "Bastione fiorito" dated 1630.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Places of worship===
* The [[Trieste Cathedral|St Justus Cathedral]] (1320). Named after the city's Patron, [[Justus of Trieste]], the church's interiors are decorated with Byzantine mosaics. It became a symbol of Italian Trieste during the [[Risorgimento]].
* The [[Saint Spyridon Church, Trieste|Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Spyridon]] (1869). The building adopts the Greek-cross plan with five cupolas in the Byzantine tradition. The parish forms part of the [[Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Austria and Switzerland]].
* The Anglican Chiesa di Cristo (Christ Church) (1829)
* [[Sant'Antonio Taumaturgo, Trieste|Sant'Antonio Taumaturgo]] (1842)
* The [[Mekhitarists|Mekhitarist]] Armenian Catholic Church (1859)
* The Waldensian and Helvetian Evangelical Basilica of St. Silvester (11th century)
* The Church of Santa Maria Maggiore (1682)
* The Augustan Evangelical-Lutheran Church (1874)
* The [[Greek Orthodox Church of San Nicolò dei Greci]] (1787). This church by the architect [[Matteo Pertsch]] (1818), with bell towers on both sides of the façade, follows the Austrian late baroque style. The interiors are decorated by golden ornaments.
* The [[Synagogue of Trieste]] (1912)
* The [[Temple of Monte Grisa]] (1960), a Roman Catholic church north of the city

===Archaeological remains===
* The Arco di Riccardo (33 BC)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Frothingham|first=A. L.|date=1904|title=A Revised List of Roman Memorial and Triumphal Arches|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=8|issue=1|pages=1–34|doi=10.2307/497017|jstor=497017|s2cid=245265389}}</ref> is a gate built in the Roman walls in 33 BC. It stands in Piazzetta Barbacan, in the narrow streets of the old town. Its current name is believed to be a corruption of Arco del Cardo, referring to the [[cardo]], the main north-to-south Roman street; folk etymology credits it to [[Richard the Lionheart]] ({{langx|it|Riccardo Cuor di Leone}}), a Crusader king of England.
* Basilica Forense (2nd century)
* Palaeochristian basilica (4th to 6th century)
* Roman Age Temples: one dedicated to Athena, one to Zeus, both on the San Giusto hill.
The ruins of the temple dedicated to Zeus are next to the Forum, those of Athena's temple are under the basilica, visitors can see its basement.

==== Roman theatre ====
The Roman theatre lies at the foot of the San Giusto hill, facing the sea. The construction partially exploits the gentle slope of the hill, and much of the theatre is made of stone. The topmost portion of the steps and the stage were supposedly made of wood. The statues which adorned the theatre, brought to light in the 1930s, are now preserved in the town museum. Three inscriptions from the [[Trajan]]ic period mention a certain Q. Petronius Modestus, someone closely connected to the development of the theatre, which was erected during the second half of the 1st century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Teatro Romano di Trieste |date=5 May 2022 |url=https://www.beniculturali.it/luogo/teatro-romano-di-trieste }}</ref>

===Caves===
In the entire [[Province of Trieste]], there are 10 speleological groups out of 24 in the whole Friuli-Venezia Giulia region. The Trieste plateau (Altopiano Triestino), called Kras or the [[Carso]] and covering an area of about {{convert|200|km2|mi2}} within Italy has approximately 1,500 caves of various sizes (like that of Basovizza, now a monument to the [[Foibe massacres]]).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-05-15 |title=Trieste {{!}} History, Population, Port, Map, & Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Trieste-Italy |access-date=2023-06-14 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

Among the more famous are the [[Grotta Gigante]], the largest tourist cave in the world, with a single cavity large enough to contain St Peter's in Rome, and the [[Cave of Trebiciano]], {{convert|350|m|ft}} deep, at the bottom of which flows the [[Timavo|Timavo River]]. This river dives underground at the [[Škocjan Caves]] in Slovenia (on the UNESCO list and only a few kilometres from Trieste) and flows about {{convert|30|km|mi}} before emerging about {{convert|1|km|mi|1}} from the sea in a series of springs near Duino, reputed by the Romans to be an entrance to Hades ("the world of the dead").{{Citation needed|date=October 2021}}

===Places of interest===
* The Austrian Quarter: Half of the city was built during the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] period, giving the city some aspects of [[Vienna|Vienna's]] architectural characteristics. The majority of buildings were built in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]], [[Art Nouveau]], [[Eclecticism in art#Western architecture|Eclectic]] and [[Liberty]] styles.
* Città Vecchia (Old City): Trieste has an extensive old city: there are many narrow and crooked streets with typical medieval houses. Almost all of the area is closed to traffic.
* [[Piazza Unità d'Italia]], Trieste's central majestic square surrounded by 19th century architecture, and the largest seafront square in Europe.
* [[Piazza Venezia (Trieste)|Piazza Venezia]], with a view over the Adriatic. Since 2009, the monument to [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Archduke Maximilian]] has been located in Piazza Venezia again, looking over the Gulf of Trieste to the Miramare Castle, the subject wearing a Vice Admiral's uniform. The more than 8 metre high bronze monument, with the allegories of the four continents, is intended to honour Maximilian's philanthropy and his interest in science and art. It was sculpted by sculptor Johannes Schilling at the request of and under the direction of Baron [[Pasquale Revoltella]]. It was inaugurated in 1875 in the presence of Emperor Franz Joseph, later removed after 1918 and relocated to the Miramare Castle Park in 1961.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trieste-di-ieri-e-di-oggi.it/2017/01/31/trieste-piazza-venezia-monumento-a-massimiliano-daustria-5/|title=Trieste – Piazza Venezia, Monumento a Massimiliano d'Austria – TRIESTE – DI IERI E DI OGGI|website=trieste-di-ieri-e-di-oggi.it}}</ref><ref>Marco Barone "La statua di Massimiliano d’Asburgo ed i simboli della massoneria" In: Bora, 16 April 2014.</ref> [[Museo Revoltella]] is located in Piazza Venezia in the style of the Italian Renaissance with its six allegorical statues of the Venetian Francesco Bosa on the roof balustrade. [[File:Piazza_Venezia_Trieste.jpg|thumb|right|Piazza Venezia]]
* The Stazione Rogers (gas station "Aquila" designed by [[Ernesto Nathan Rogers]]) is considered an important building of Italian rationalism and post-war modernism and is now a multi-purpose centre for culture and architecture.<ref>[http://www.stazionerogers.org/content/ledificio Stazione Rogers - the building]</ref>
* Molo Sartorio, where still today the sea level for the Republic of Austria, a landlocked nation, is measured as "metres above the Adriatic". The historic "Antico Magazzino Vini" next to the Piazza Venezia was built in 1902 to store wine from Dalmatia and Istria. It has now been revitalised and now houses an [[Eataly]]. The former fish market, now renovated, is now a place for exhibitions and art, and is also located directly by the sea.
* [[Canal Grande (Trieste)|Canal Grande]], Trieste's grand canal, in the very centre of the city.
* [[Caffè San Marco]], a historical coffee house in the centre of the city. Cafès play an important role in the Triestine economy, as Trieste developed a thriving coffee industry under [[Austria-Hungary]], and is still known to this day as "the coffee capital of Italy".
* [[Barcola]], a suburb of Trieste with a special microclimate<ref name="Zeno Saracino 2018"/> and a high quality of life since ancient times. On its kilometre-long sea promenade towards Miramare Castle there are cafes and restaurants. Many locals spend their free time on this urban beach area, sunbathing, swimming and playing sports.The northernmost lighthouse in the Mediterranean, the [[Vittoria Light]], located above Barcola, dominates the skyline above.<ref>Nicolo Giraldi "Un mare chiamato Trieste" in IES 6/June-2019, p 2.</ref>
* [[Val Rosandra]], a national park on the border between the [[Province of Trieste]] and Slovenia.

===Beaches===
[[File:View_from_Vittoria_Lighthouse.jpg|thumb|right|View of Barcola from the Vittoria Lighthouse]]
Much of Trieste lies directly on the sea. Some bathing establishments are located in the very centre, like the "El Pedocin - Bagno marino La Lanterna" and the "Ausonia". The "Bagno Marino Ferroviario" has been located in Viale Miramare 30 since 1925.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trieste-di-ieri-e-di-oggi.it/2017/01/26/trieste-dopolavoro-ferroviario-bagno-marino-ferroviario/|title=Trieste – Dopolavoro Ferroviario – Bagno Marino Ferroviario – TRIESTE – DI IERI E DI OGGI|website=trieste-di-ieri-e-di-oggi.it}}</ref> Many locals and students use their lunch break or free time to go to [[Barcola]], which is an [[urban beach]], to meet friends on the famous mile-long embankment.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}} In the evening, many locals walk there between the bars with a view of the sea, the [[Alps|Alpine arc]], [[Istria]] and the city.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

Well-known are the 10 popular semi-circular units on the bank consisting of a viewing platform, sanitary facilities and changing rooms, which are popularly referred to as "Topolini".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.triesteallnews.it/2018/08/bagno-pubblico-topolini-storia-di-uno-stabilimento-americano/|title=Bagno Pubblico "Topolini": storia di uno stabilimento "americano" - TRIESTE.news|first=Zeno|last=Saracino|date=August 25, 2018}}</ref> In the area of the Excelsior bathing establishment, which is located on a historic sand bank, there were elegant Roman villas and their sports and bathing facilities in antiquity.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.triesteallnews.it/2018/09/pompei-in-miniatura-la-storia-di-vallicula-o-barcola/|title="Pompei in miniatura": la storia di "Vallicula" o Barcola - TRIESTE.news|first=Zeno|last=Saracino|date=September 29, 2018}}</ref> Already in the 19th century there were numerous restaurants and cafes with shady vine arbors. The sea around Miramare Castle is today a nature reserve.

The pine forest of Barcola is located directly on the sea and is a meeting place for the inhabitants in every season. One of the best running routes in Trieste leads from Barcola to Miramare Castle and back. The small bathing complex Bagno da Sticco is right next to Miramare Castle. Further towards [[Grignano (Trieste)|Grignano]] and [[Duino]] there are numerous bays and natural beaches. Due to the currents in the Adriatic, the water in the area of Trieste is very pure and not polluted by suspended matter from rivers. The current is counterclockwise.<ref>Mauro Covacich: Triest verkehrt.

The literary-intellectual centre of Trieste is mostly located in the downtown area: "Libreria Antiquaria Umberto Saba" located at the ground floor of Via San Nicolò No. 30, where [[James Joyce]] lived (where his son Giorgio was born and where Joyce wrote some of the short stories from Dubliners and Stephen Hero); the house in Via San Nicolò No. 31, where [[Umberto Saba]] spent his breaks at the cafe-milk shop "Walter" and the house in Via San Nicolò No. 32, in which the Berlitz School was located and where James Joyce came into contact with and subsequently taught  [[Italo Svevo]], are all of literary relevance. Around this area, at the end of Via San Nicolò, a life-size statue of Umberto Saba has been placed by the city government. Having Via San Nicolò become Trieste's high street, numerous cafes and restaurants that used to be located there, most notably the Berger beer hall at No. 17, which later became the Berger Grand Restaurant, have now ceased operations.

The [[Greek Orthodox Church of San Nicolò dei Greci]], which is dedicated to [[Saint Nicholas]], the patron saint of seafarers and whose interior inspired James Joyce, is located by the sea in Piazza Tommaseo, next to the historic Caffè Tommaseo. This coffee house, also located at the beginning of Via San Nicolò, was opened in 1830.

Caffe Stella Polare is located in Piazza Ponterosso. This cosmopolitan coffee house was also frequented by Saba, Joyce, Guido Voghera, Virgilio Giotti and in particular by the former German-speaking minority from Trieste. With the end of World War II and the arrival of the Anglo-Americans in the city, this café became a hangout place of many soldiers and a famous ballroom to meet local young women.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discover-trieste.it/code/19918/Caffe-Stella-Polare|title=Caffè Stella Polare|website=Discover Trieste}}</ref>

Trieste has a lively cultural scene with various theatres. Among these figure [[Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Politeama Rossetti]], the Teatro La Contrada, the [[Slovene theatre in Trieste]] ({{lang|sl|Slovensko stalno gledališče}}, since 1902), Teatro Miela, and several smaller ones.

There are also a number of museums. Among these are:
* Diego de Henriquez war museum
* [[Museo Sartorio]]
* [[Revoltella Museum]] modern art gallery
* [[Civico Museo di Storia Naturale di Trieste]] (natural history museum) containing fossils of [[Hominidae|Hominids]].
* [[Civico Orto Botanico di Trieste]], the municipal [[botanical garden]]
* [[Orto Botanico dell'Università di Trieste]], the [[University of Trieste]]'s botanical garden

Two important national monuments:
* The [[Risiera di San Sabba]] (Risiera di San Sabba Museum), a [[National monument]] commemorating [[the holocaust]] genocide. It was the only [[Nazi]] concentration camp with a crematorium in Italy.
* The [[Foibe massacres|Foiba di Basovizza]], a National monument. It is a reminder of the killings of Italians by Yugoslav partisans after World War II.

The Slovenska gospodarsko-kulturna zveza—Unione Economica-Culturale Slovena is the umbrella organisation bringing together cultural and economic associations belonging to the [[Slovene minority in Italy|Slovene minority]].

===Sports===
The local [[association football|football]] club, [[U.S. Triestina Calcio|Triestina]], is one of the older clubs in Italy. Notably, it was runner-up in the [[1947–48 Serie A|1947–1948 season]] of the Italian first division ([[Serie A]]), losing the championship to [[Torino F.C.|Torino]].

Trieste is notable for having had two football clubs participating in the championships of two different nations at the same time during the period of the [[Free Territory of Trieste]], due to the schism within the city and region created by the post-war demarcation. [[U.S. Triestina Calcio|Triestina]] played in the Italian first division ([[Serie A]]). Although it faced relegation after the [[Serie A 1946-47|first season]] after the Second World War, the [[FIGC]] modified the rules, as it was deemed important to keep the club in the league. The following year the club played its best season with a 3rd-place finish. Meanwhile, Yugoslavia bought [[Circolo Sportivo Ponziana 1912|A.S.D. Ponziana]], a small team in Trieste, which under the new name Amatori Ponziana Trst, played in the [[Yugoslav First League 1946-47|Yugoslavian league]] for three years.<ref name="Calcio by John Foot">{{Cite book| title = Calcio | publisher = Harper Perennial| id = {{ASIN|0007175744|country=uk}} }}</ref> Triestina went bankrupt in the 1990s, but after being re-founded, it regained a position in the Italian second division ([[Serie B]]) in 2002. Ponziana was renamed "[[Circolo Sportivo Ponziana 1912]]" and currently plays in Friuli-Venezia Giulia Group of [[Promozione]], which is the 7th level of the [[Lega Calcio|Italian league]].

Trieste also has a well-known basketball team, [[Pallacanestro Trieste]], which reached its zenith in the 1990s under coach [[Bogdan Tanjević]] when, with large financial backing from sponsors [[Stefanel]], it was able to sign players such as [[Dejan Bodiroga]], [[Fernando Gentile]] and [[Gregor Fučka]], stars of European basketball. At the end of the 2017–18 season, the team, now trained by coach Eugenio Dalmasson and sponsored by Alma, won promotion to the [[Lega Basket Serie A]], Italy's highest basketball league, 14 years after its last tenure.

Many sailing clubs have roots in the city which contribute to Trieste's strong tradition in that sport. The [[Barcolana regatta]], first held in 1969, is the world's largest sailing race by number of participants.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

Local sporting facilities include the [[Stadio Nereo Rocco]], a [[UEFA]]-certified stadium with seating capacity of 32,500; the [[Palatrieste]], an indoor sporting arena sitting 7,000 people, and Piscina Bruno Bianchi, a large Olympic size swimming pool.

On 26 August 1985  American basketball player [[Michael Jordan]] dunked so hard that the backboard shattered during a Nike exhibition game played in Trieste. The signed jersey and shoes (including one of the tiny shards of glass in the sole of the left shoe) that the player wore during the famous shattered backboard game were later auctioned. The moment the glass broke was filmed and is often cited as a particularly important milestone in Jordan's rise.<ref>[https://www.essentiallysports.com/nba-when-michael-jordan-shattered-more-than-just-minds-through-his-performance-in-italy/ When Michael Jordan Shattered More Than Just Minds Through His Performance in Italy ]; Alex Green "Michael Jordan's 'shattered backboard' jersey to go under the hammer" In: Independent - Ireland, 18 November 2020; [https://eu.usatoday.com/story/gameon/2013/02/18/michael-jordan-shattered-backboard/1927833/ USA Today: Michael Jordan shatters backboard in 1985 exhibition]; Barbara Kutscher "Sportschuhe von Promis werden zu Luxusobjekten in einem wachsenden Markt" In: Handelsblatt 27.08.2020; Elliott Bretland "From A £500,000 Classic To Eminem, These Are The Rarest Air Jordans Around" In: The Sportsman 10.01.02021; Flavio Vanetti "Michael Jordan e l’Italia: quella volta che giocò a Trieste nel 1985 (e ruppe un tabellone con una schiacciata)" In: Corriere della Sera 21.05.2020; Shlomo Sprung "Christie's Unveils Auction Of Michael Jordan Game-Worn Sneakers" In: Forbes 23.07.2020; "«C’est le Picasso du sport»: les sneakers de Michael Jordan pourraient faire flamber les enchères" In: Le Parisien 30.07.2020; Maitreyee Joshi "When Michael Jordan Shattered More Than Just Minds Through His Performance in Italy" In: Essentially Sports 25.03.2020; Ricky O'Donnell "The time Michael Jordan shattered a backboard during a game in Italy" In: SB Nation - Vox Media 10.04.2020; "La impresionante jugada de Jordan en la cara de un ex-Olimpo" In: La Nueva 18.05.2020; Fabrice Auclert "Souvenirs: le jour où Michael Jordan a explosé un panier" In: Basket USA 19.10.2011.</ref>

===Film===
Trieste has been portrayed on screen a number of times, with films often [[Location shooting|shot on location]]. In 1942 the early [[Italian neorealism|neorealist]] ''[[Alfa Tau!]]'' was filmed partly in the city.

Cinematic interest in Trieste peaked during the height of the "Free Territory" era from 1947 to 1954, with international films such as ''[[Sleeping Car to Trieste]]'' and ''[[Diplomatic Courier]]'' portraying it as a hotbed of espionage. These films, along with ''[[The Yellow Rolls-Royce]]'' (1964), conveyed an image of the city as a [[multicultural|cosmopolitan]] place of conflict between [[Great Powers]], a portrayal which resembles ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1943). Italian filmmakers, by contrast, portrayed Trieste as unquestionably Italian in a series of patriotic films, including ''[[Trieste mia!]]'' and ''[[Ombre su Trieste]]''.<ref>Pizzi, Katia. ''A City in Search of an Author''. Bloomsbury Publishing, 2001. p.61-62</ref>

In 1963 the city hosted the first International Festival of Science Fiction Film (Festival internazionale del film di fantascienza), which ran until 1982. Under the name Science Plus Fiction (now [[Trieste Science+Fiction Festival]]), the festival was revived in 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencefictionfestival.org/archivio-edizioni/festival-internazionale-del-film-di-fantascienza/fiff-1963/|title=Trieste Science+Fiction – Festival della Fantascienza » FIFF 1963|access-date=16 September 2015|archive-date=9 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150709150745/http://www.sciencefictionfestival.org/archivio-edizioni/festival-internazionale-del-film-di-fantascienza/fiff-1963/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://scifiportal.eu/trieste-international-film-festival/|title=Trieste International Film Festival|access-date=16 September 2015|archive-date=2 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502002956/http://scifiportal.eu/trieste-international-film-festival/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

An interest in the city has been sparked by movies such as ''[[The Invisible Boy (2014 film)|The Invisible Boy]]'' (2014), its sequel ''The Invisible Boy—Second Generation'', and the TV series ''La Porta Rossa''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ilpiccolo.gelocal.it/tempo-libero/2018/03/04/news/il-sequel-della-porta-rossa-apre-il-set-a-trieste-1.16552272|title=Set porta rossa a Trieste|date=4 March 2018}}</ref>

==Triestine cuisine==
[[File:Caffe degli Specchi.JPG|thumb|Caffe degli Specchi was opened in 1839 in Trieste.]]
There are three types of eateries: the conventional restaurant; the buffet, where ham, meat loaf, goulash, roast meat, Kaiserfleisch, tongue and belly meat are served; and the osmiza, a characteristic eatery in the Karst, where locally farmed products are enjoyed paired with wine.

Local cuisine has been influenced by the various ethnic groups which have populated the city, mainly Central Europeans. Traditional main courses include [[istrian stew|jota]], minestra de bisi spacai (pea stew), rotolo di spinaci in straza (spinach rolls), sardoni impanai (breaded anchovies, a sought-after delicacy), capuzi garbi (krauts), capuzi garbi in tecia (sautéed krauts), [[vienna sausage]]s, [[goulash]], [[ćevapi]] and frito misto (fried fish). Popular desserts are presnitz, fave triestine, titola, crostoli, struccolo de pomi, kugelhupf, rigo jancsi and the Triester torte.<ref>Giuliana Fabricio, La cucina della tradizione triestina, Gorizia, Editrice Goriziana, 2004.</ref><ref>Maria Stelvio, Cucina triestina, III° edizione, Trieste, Stab. Tip. Nazionale, 1936.</ref><ref>Iolanda de Vonderweid, Cucina triestina, cucina istriana, cucina dalmata, Trieste, Lint Editoriale, 2003</ref>

Capo Triestino (also capo in B or capo in bicchiere) is considered a local coffee speciality. This miniature cappuccino in a glass cup is usually consumed at the bar.<ref>"Kaffee-Inspirationen: Kaffeebuch mit exklusiven Rezepten" (2013), Università del Caffè di Trieste, p 62.</ref>

==Transport==
[[File:porttrieste old.jpg|thumb|right|The Porto Vecchio, also showing [[Trieste Centrale railway station]]]]

===Maritime transport===
Trieste's maritime location and its former long-term status as part of the [[Austrian Empire]]—later the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]—made the [[Port of Trieste]] the major commercial port for much of the landlocked areas of central Europe. In the 19th century, a new port district known as the Porto Nuovo was built northeast of the city centre.<ref name=trdt>{{cite news | first = Christian | last = Ammann |author2=Juvanec, Maj | title = Discovering Trieste | work = Today's Railways | publisher = Platform 5 Publishing Ltd | pages = 29–31 |date=May 2007}}</ref>

Significant volumes of goods pass through the container, steel works and oil terminals, all located to the south of the city centre. After many years of stagnation, a change in the leadership placed the port on a steady growth path, recording a 40% increase in shipping traffic {{As of|2007|lc=y}}.<ref name = trdt/>

Today the port of Trieste is one of the largest Italian ports and next to [[Gioia Tauro]] the only deep water port in the central Mediterranean for seventh generation container ships.<ref>Andreas Deutsch: Verlagerungseffekte im containerbasierten Hinterlandverkehr.

===Rail transport===
[[File:Trieste Centrale (IMG 20211010 115938).jpg|thumb|right|[[Trieste Centrale railway station]]]]

{{See also|Trieste Centrale railway station}}
[[Railway]]s came early to Trieste, due to the importance of its port and the need to transport people and goods inland. The first railroad line to reach Trieste was the [[Southern Railway (Austria)|Südbahn]], built by the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] government in 1857. This railway stretches for {{convert|1400|km|0|abbr=on}} to [[Lviv]], Ukraine, via [[Ljubljana]], Slovenia; [[Sopron]], [[Hungary]]; Vienna, [[Austria]]; and [[Kraków]], [[Poland]], crossing the backbone of the [[Alps]] mountains through the [[Semmering Pass]] near [[Graz]]. It approaches Trieste through the village of [[Villa Opicina]], a few kilometres from the centre but over {{convert|300|m|0|abbr=off}} higher in elevation. Due to this, the line takes a {{convert|32|km|0|abbr=off}} detour to the north, gradually descending before terminating at the [[Trieste Centrale railway station]].

In 1887, the [[Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways]] (German: {{lang|de|kaiserlich-königliche österreichische Staatsbahnen}}) opened a new railway line, the [[:it:Ferrovia Trieste-Erpelle|Trieste–Hrpelje railway]] (German: {{lang|de|Hrpelje-Bahn}}), from the new port of Trieste to [[Municipality of Hrpelje-Kozina|Hrpelje-Kozina]], on the [[:it:Ferrovia Istriana|Istrian railway]].<ref name="trenidicarta.it">{{cite web |author=Alessandro Tuzza |url=http://www.trenidicarta.it/aperture.html |title=Prospetto cronologico dei tratti di ferrovia aperti all'esercizio dal 1839 al 31 dicembre 1926 |trans-title=Chronological overview of the features of the railways opened between 1839 and 31 December 1926 |website=www.trenidicarta.it |publisher=Alessandro Tuzza |access-date=17 December 2010 |language=it |display-authors=etal}}</ref> The intended function of the new line was to reduce the Austrian Empire's dependence on the Südbahn network.<ref>{{cite web |author=Oberegger, Elmar |url=http://members.a1.net/edze/enzyklopaedie/hrpelje.htm |title=Hrpelje-Bahn |trans-title=Hrpelje Railway |others=Part of this series: Zur Eisenbahngeschichte des Alpen-Donau-Adria-Raumes |publisher=Oberegger, Elmar |access-date=7 March 2011 |language=de |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723001106/http://members.a1.net/edze/enzyklopaedie/hrpelje.htm |archive-date=23 July 2011 }}</ref> Its opening gave Trieste a second station south of the original one, which was named Trieste Sant'Andrea (German: {{lang|de|Triest Sankt Andrea}}). The two stations were connected by a railway line that in the initial plans was meant to be an interim solution: the [[:it:Linea delle Rive|Rive railway]] (German: {{lang|de|Rive-Bahn}}), which survived until 1981, when it was replaced by the [[:it:Linea di cintura (Trieste)|Galleria di Circonvallazione]], a {{convert|5.7|km|mi|adj=on}} railway tunnel route to the east of the city.

With the opening of the [[Bohinj Railway|Transalpina Railway]] from Vienna, Austria via [[Jesenice railway station|Jesenice]] and [[Nova Gorica railway station|Nova Gorica]] in 1906, the St. Andrea station was replaced by a new, more capacious, facility, named Trieste stazione dello Stato (German: {{lang|de|Triest Staatsbahnhof}}), later [[:it:Stazione di Trieste Campo Marzio|Trieste Campo Marzio]], now a railway museum, and the original station came to be identified as Trieste stazione della Meridionale or Trieste Meridionale (German: {{lang|de|Triest Südbahnhof}}). This railway also approached Trieste via Villa Opicina, but it took a rather shorter loop southwards towards the sea front. Freight lines from the dock area include container services to northern Italy and to Budapest, Hungary, together with [[rolling highway]] services to Salzburg, Austria and Frankfurt, Germany.

There are direct intercity and high-speed trains between Trieste and Venice, Verona, Turin, Milan, Rome, Florence, Naples and Bologna. Passenger trains also run between Villa Opicina and Ljubljana.

On special occasion, the historic ETR 252 "Arlecchino" runs the Venezia Santa Lucia-Trieste Centrale route, operated by Fondazionefs. This is one of four examples ever built.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rapido Arlecchino |url=https://www.fondazionefs.it/content/fondazionefs/it/treni-storici/2022/10/9/rapido-arlecchino.html |access-date=2022-10-20 |website=www.fondazionefs.it |language=it}}</ref>

===Air transport===
[[File:MyAviationNetPhotoID00239147.jpg|200px|thumb|Trieste Airport]]
Trieste is served by the [[Trieste Airport]] ([[IATA]]: TRS). The airport serves domestic and international destinations and is fully connected to the national railway and highway networks. The [[Trieste Airport railway station]] links the passenger terminal directly to the [[Venice–Trieste railway]] thanks to a 425-metre long skybridge. A 16 platform bus terminal, a multi-storey car park with 500 lots and a car park with 1,000 lots give public and private motor vehicles rapid access to the [[Autostrada A4 (Italy)|A4 Trieste-Turin highway]]. At the interchange near Palmanova, the A4 branches off to [[Autostrada A23 (Italy)|Autostrada A23]] linking to Austria's [[Süd Autobahn]] (A2) via Udine and Tarvisio. In the southern direction, this highway also offers seamless interconnection to Slovenia's [[A1 motorway (Slovenia)|A1 Motorway]], and through that to highway networks in Croatia, Hungary, and the Balkans.

===Local transport===

[[File:Vespa in Trieste.jpg|thumb|Scooters are used as personal transport in Trieste.]]
Local public transport is operated by Trieste Trasporti, a part of TPL FVG, which operates a network of around 60 bus routes and two ferry lines. Its also operates the [[Opicina Tramway]], a hybrid between a tramway and [[funicular|funicular railway]], providing a more direct link between the city centre and Opicina.<ref name=ttws>{{cite web | url = http://www.triestetrasporti.it/ | title = Trieste Trasporti S.p.A. | publisher = Trieste Trasporti S.p.A. | access-date = April 27, 2007}}</ref>
