In 2013, its population was 153,143. Foggia is the main city of a plain called [[Tavoliere delle Puglie|Tavoliere]], also known as the "[[granary]] of Italy".

==History==
[[File:Piazzacavourfoggia.JPG|thumb|left|Piazza Cavour in Foggia]]
The name "''Foggia''" (originally ''Focis'') probably derives from [[Latin]] "''fovea''", meaning "''pit''", referring to the pits where wheat was stored. The name's etymology remains uncertain however, as it could as well stem from "''[[Phocaea]]''", or possibly probably from the [[Medieval Greek]] word for "''fire''", which is "''fotia''", as according to legend the original settlers of the 11th century AD were peasants, allegedly after having [miraculously] discovered there a panel portraying the [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Madonna]] Nicopeia, on which three flames burnt.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

The area had been settled since [[Neolithic]] times, and later on a [[Dauni|Daunian]] settlement known as [[Arpi]] (in Greek ''Argos Hippium'' or ''Ἀργόριππα'') existed nearby, close to present-day {{ill|Arpinova|it}}. It was the largest city in ancient [[Daunia]]. An anachronistic legend reported by [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]] claimed that the Daunian city had been founded by [[Diomedes]] following the [[Trojan War]].

However the first document attesting to the existence of the modern city dates to 1100, in the papal bull of [[Pope Paschal II]] which mentions the church of ''Sancta Maria de Focis''. The area remained marshy and unhealthy until the late 11th century, when [[Robert Guiscard]] directed draining the wetland, boosting the economic and social growth of the city. The city was the seat of [[Henry, Count of Monte Sant'Angelo]] during the last twenty years of the 11th century. In the 12th century, [[William II of Sicily]] built a cathedral here and further enlarged the settlement.

[[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] had a palace built in Foggia in 1223, in which he often sojourned. He elected the city "Regalis Sedes Inclita Imperialis", the preferred seat of the Empire, as we can now read on the entrance epigraph of the remains of the imperial palace. It was also seat of his court and a ''studium'', including notable figures such as the mathematician and scholar [[Michael Scot]], but little of it remains now. In 1447, King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] built a Custom Palace to tax the local sheep farmers. This caused a decline of the local economy and the progressive ruin of the land, which again became marshy. In [[1456 Central Italy earthquakes|1456]], an earthquake struck Foggia, followed by others in 1534, [[1627 Gargano earthquake|1627]] and 1731, the last destroying one third of the city. The [[House of Bourbon]] promoted a certain economic growth by boosting the cereal agriculture of Capitanata and rebuilding much of the settlement.

In the 19th century, Foggia received a railway station and important public monuments. The citizens also took part in the riots which led to the [[unification of Italy|annexation to Italy]] in 1861. By 1865, there was a definitive shift from the custom of sheep farming in favour of an agricultural economy.

The historical lack of water resources was solved with the construction of the [[Apulian aqueduct]] in 1924, when Foggia was already an important hub between northern and southern Italy.

During World War II, Foggia was [[Bombing of Foggia|heavily bombed by the Allied air forces]] for its important airfields and marshalling yards. On 22 July 1943, Foggia was bombed over 100 [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17 Flying Fortresses]]. The city was devastated, and 7,643 residents were killed and over 700 injured. On 19 August 1943, Foggia's marshalling yards were bombed by 233 [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17s]] and [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24 Liberators]] – obliterating what was left of the city and killing another 9,581. 

After the [[armistice of Cassibile]] on 8 September 1943, the town was briefly occupied by German troops in [[Operation Achse]]. There was some fighting there during the [[Allied invasion of Italy]]. In response to the Allied advance towards them, the German troops occupying Foggia abandoned the city on the 27th of September. By the 1st of October British troops had successfully occupied the city.  In order to clear the Germans from the hills north and west of the Fogia plain and to reach the Vinchiaturo-Termoli road near the Biferno River, Britain's [[Bernard Montgomery|General Montgomery]] sent his [[XIII Corps (United Kingdom)|British XIII Corps]] beyond Foggia on a two division drive, the [[78th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|78th Division]] (sometimes known as "the Battle Axe division"<ref>{{cite web | title=Badge, Formation, 78th Infantry Division & 11th Infantry Brigade | website=Imperial War Museums | date=1942-05-25 | url=http://www.iwm.org.uk/collections/item/object/30072645 | access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref>) moved on the coastal road to [[Termoli]] and the [[1st Canadian Division]] struck inland through the mountains.  British V Corps followed, protecting the west flank and the rear.  The German 1st parachute division had largely withdrawn to the Biferno River near [[Termoli]] and dug in.  Based out of Foggia, the British launched [[Operation Devon]] and succeeded in dislodging the Nazi German forces from [[Termoli]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Blumenson|first=Martin|title=United States Army in WWII - the Mediterranean - Salerno to Cassino|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YIJvCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT255|edition=Illus.|date=15 August 2014|publisher=Lucknow Books|isbn=978-1-78289-410-0|page=255}}</ref> The [[Foggia Airfield Complex|Foggia airfields]] were subsequently used by Allied fighter and bomber formations until the end of the war, mainly from the American [[Fifteenth Air Force|15th]] but also from the [[Twelfth Air Force|12th Air Force]], the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[South African Air Force]].

In 1959 and 2006, Foggia received, respectively, the gold medal for Civil and Military value for its role in World War II.

==Main sights==
[[File:Foggia, cattedrale da via Arpi.jpg|thumb|upright|Foggia, Cathedral from via Arpi]]
* The [[Foggia Cathedral|cathedral]] of ''Santa Maria de Fovea'', probably erected about 1179,<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Foggia|volume=10|page=590}}</ref> which is directly linked with the patron saint "[[The Madonna|Madonna]] dei Sette Veli" (Madonna of the Seven Veils). This site has two levels of architectural style: the lower part is [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]], as with many Apulian churches; the upper part is a remarkable example of Baroque. The upper part was reconstructed after a 1731 earthquake that destroyed a great part of the historical centre.
* ''Palazzo Dogana'', the historical seat of the sheep custom. In July 2013 this Palace was elected by [[UNESCO]] as "Messenger Monument of the Culture of Peace" for its role in the cultural exchanges during centuries.{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}
* ''Chiesa delle Croci'' ("Church of the Crosses").
