==History==
During the [[Vedic period|Vedic age]], Sasaram was a part of the ancient [[Kāsī (kingdom)|Kashi kingdom]]. Sasaram's name derives from ''Sahastrarama'', meaning "one thousand groves". Sasaram was once also named '''Shah Sarai''' (meaning "Place of the King"), as it is the birthplace of the [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] king [[Sher Shah Suri]], who ruled over [[Delhi]], much of northern India, present-day Pakistan, and eastern Afghanistan for five years as the [[Sur Empire]], after defeating the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Humayun]]. Many of Sher Shah Suri's governmental practices were adopted by the Mughals and later the British Raj, including taxation, administration, and the building of a paved road from [[Kabul]] to [[Bengal]], also called the [[Grand Trunk Road]].

Sher Shah Suri's {{convert|122|ft|adj=on}} [[sandstone|red sandstone]] [[Tomb of Sher Shah Suri|tomb]], built in the [[Mughal architecture|Indo-Afghan style]], stands in the middle of an artificial lake in Sasaram. It borrows heavily from the [[Lodi dynasty|Lodhi]] style, and was once covered in blue and yellow glazed tiles, indicating an Iranian influence. The massive free-standing dome also has an aesthetic aspect of the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[stupa]] style of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] period. The tomb of Sher Shah's father, Hasan Khan Suri, is also at Sasaram, and stands in the middle of a green field at Sherganj, which is known as Sukha Rauza. About a kilometre to the north west of Sher Shah's tomb lies the incomplete and dilapidated tomb of his son and successor, [[Islam Shah Suri]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanatani|first1=Rohit Priyadarshi|title=The Tomb of Salim Shah Suri (Islam Shah): The glory that never was.|url=http://thespeakingarch.com/islam_shah_tomb/|website=The Speaking Arch|access-date=27 March 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402144031/http://thespeakingarch.com/islam_shah_tomb/|archive-date=2 April 2015}}</ref> Sasaram also has a ''Baulia'', a pool used by the emperor's consorts for bathing.

The fort of Sher Shah Suri at [[Rohtasgarh]] is in Sasaram. This fort has a history dating back to the 7th century CE. It was built by Raja [[Harishchandra]], known for his truthfulness in the name of his son [[Rohitashva|Rohitashwa]]. It houses the Churasan temple, [[Ganesh]] temple, Diwan-i-Khas, Diwan-e-Aam, and various other structures dating back to different centuries. The fort also served as the headquarters of [[Raja Man Singh]] during his reign as the governor of Bihar and Bengal under the regime of [[Akbar]]. The Rohtas Fort in Bihar should not be confused with [[Rohtas Fort|another fort of the same name]], near [[Jhelum]], [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]], in present-day [[Pakistan]]. The Rohtas Fort in Sasaram was also built by Sher Shah Suri, during the period when [[Humayun]] was exiled from Hindustan.

There is a [[Maa Tara Chandi Temple|temple of Goddess Tarachandi]], two miles to the south, and an inscription of Pratap Dhawal on the rock close to the temple of Chandi Devi.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shilpa |date=7 December 2018 |title=Maa Tara Chandi Temple, Bihar |url=https://www.bharattemples.com/maa-tara-chandi-temple-bihar/ |access-date=28 November 2023 |website=Bharat Temples |language=en-US}}</ref> Hindus in large number assemble to worship the goddess. [[Dhua Kund]], a notable waterfall, is located about {{cvt|15|km}} from the city.

Rohtas, south of Sasaram, is known to have been the residence of one Satyawadi Raja Harischandra, named for his son, [[Rohitashva|Rohitashwa]].

===Minor Rock Edict of Ashoka===
Sasaram is also famous for an inscription by [[Ashoka]] (one of the thirteen [[Minor Rock Edicts]]), situated in a small cave of Kaimur hill, near Chandan Shaheed.

The edict is located near the top of the terminal spur of the [[Kimur Range]] near Sasaram.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/v/019pho000001003u00476000.html|title=BLO|access-date=25 September 2018|archive-date=29 October 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211029161630/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/v/019pho000001003u00476000.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> There is the Minor rock edict #1 only.<ref name="Chak">India: An Archaeological History: Palaeolithic Beginnings to Early Historic ... by Dilip K.

==Economy==

The closure of the industries of the [[Dalmia Group]] at [[Dalmianagar]] resulted in widespread unemployment. Sasaram's economy is mainly driven by [[agriculture]] and related industries like [[rice polishing]]. The canal irrigation system is also very prominent in this area. Because of the fertile land around the town, it is a local trading center for food grains, agricultural products, and agricultural equipment, the region is known as Dhan Ka Katora, meaning "a bowl of food grains". The rice grown near Sasaram is sold in the markets of [[Kolkata]] and [[New Delhi]]. The only significant industry is rock [[quarry]]ing.

==Transportation==

However, now this AC train runs between [[Gaya, India|Gaya]] and [[Anand Vihar Terminal]], still stopping at Sasaram Junction.

==Education==
Sasaram is the sixth most literate city in Bihar, with Rohtas being the most literate district in Bihar.<ref>[http://www.sawansasaram.ml/ SAWAN SASARAM]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Census |first=India |date=16 August 2022 |title=literacy rate in Bihar (2022), including the literacy rate of all districts in Bihar. |url=https://www.indiacensus.net/states/bihar/literacy |access-date=16 August 2022 |website=IndiaCensus.net}}</ref>

There are four government colleges, although many students prefer to go to more developed cities for quality education, such as [[Bangalore]], [[New Delhi]], [[Pune]], [[Patna]], [[Varanasi]] and [[Pondicherry|Puducherry]], for higher education. A new engineering college has been set up in the region.

This place is also known for preparation of competitive exams at [[Sasaram Junction railway station|Sasaram Railway junction]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/bihar/station-students-get-a-platform/cid/1380982 | title=Station students get a platform}}</ref> According to earlier natives of this city, there was not proper electrification of city around 2007 to 2008, which hampered the studies of students seeking for competitive exams. [[Indian Railways]] had a 24-hour power supply at Sasaram junction, leading a small group of students to study there at night under electric lights.
