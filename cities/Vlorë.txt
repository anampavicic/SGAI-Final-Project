Located in southwestern Albania, Vlorë sprawls on the [[Bay of Vlorë]] and is surrounded by the foothills of the [[Ceraunian Mountains]] along the [[Albanian Adriatic Sea Coast|Albanian Adriatic]] and [[Albanian Ionian Sea Coast|Ionian Sea Coast]]s. It experiences a [[Mediterranean climate]], which is affected by the Ceraunian Mountains and the proximity to the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

The coastal area of Vlorë was one of those [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] sites that had experienced pre-urban activity beginning from the 11th–10th centuries BCE. The area was [[Greek colonisation|colonized]] by [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]]. A large fortified port-town that was inhabited from the 6th century BCE to the 2nd century AD is placed, now partially submerged, in [[Triport, Vlorë|Triport]], northwest of present-day Vlorë. Substantial port activity in this site occurred from at least the [[Archaic Greece|archaic period]] to the [[medieval period]]. It has been suggested that a transfer of the ancient city from the site of Triport to the site of modern Vlorë occurred. The center of the modern city features archaeological remains dating from late antiquity. ''Aulon'', from which the modern city took its name, appears in historical sources starting form the 2nd century CE. It was conquered at different periods throughout history by [[Roman Empire|Romans]], [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]], [[Normans]], [[Venetian Empire|Venetians]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].

Between the 18th and 19th centuries, the [[Albanians]] gathered both spiritual and intellectual strength for national consciousness, which conclusively led to the [[Albanian Renaissance]]. Vlorë played an instrumental role in Albanian Independence as an epicenter for the founders of modern Albania, who signed the [[Albanian Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] on 28 November 1912 at the [[Assembly of Vlorë]].

Vlorë is one of the most significant cities of [[southern Albania]] and the region of [[Labëria]] which is traditionally noted for its culture, traditions and folklore. Vlorë is served by the [[Port of Vlorë]], the [[SH 8 (Albania)|SH8 highway]], and the [[A2 (Albania)|A2 motorway]], collectively representing part of the [[Adriatic–Ionian motorway|Adriatic–Ionian Corridor]] and the [[Pan-European Corridor VIII]].

== Name ==

The city took its name from {{Langx|grc|Αὐλών|Aulṓn}}, meaning "channel, glen" that resembles an [[aulos]] instrument. It is a typical toponym in the Greek world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Babiniotis |first1=Georgios |title=Dictionary of the Modern Greek Language |date=2019 |publisher=Kéntro Lexikologías |isbn=978-9609582148 |page=315 |quote=ηκαν το αρχ. δίαυλος «πέρασμα, δίοδος» και το νεότ. πύραυλος. Η κοιλάδα που μοιάζει με αυλό λέγεται αυλών (αυλώνας). από όπου το συχνό τοπωνύμιο Αυλών {{!}} Αυλώνα, ... Αυλώνας (ο) πόλη και λιμάνι τής Ν. Αλβανίας}}</ref> The name of the city was first recorded in the 2nd century AD, by two [[Ancient Greek]] authors, [[Lucian]] and [[Ptolemy]], the latter calling it "town and sea-port", which confirms that it was founded much earlier. However, Aulon has not been mentioned by earlier Ancient Greek and Roman authors, who on the other hand recorded the nearby town and seaport of [[Oricum]]. But in later sources Oricum is less encountered, while the toponym Aulon is more frequently mentioned.<ref name="Demiraj" />

''Vlorë'' developed from the ancient ''Aulon-a'' through the evolution of the [[Sound change|phonetic system]] of the [[Albanian language]] with the [[rhotacism]] ''Vlonë'' > ''Vlorë'',<ref>{{Cite book|last=Katičić|first=Radoslav|author-link=Radoslav Katičić|title=Ancient Languages of the Balkans|date=1976|publisher=Mouton|isbn=978-9027933058|page=186}}</ref><ref name="Demiraj" /> which is a pre-Slavic phenomenon in Albanian. The intervocalic {{IPA|/n/}} has regularly evolved to {{IPA|/r/}} in [[Tosk Albanian]], while the initial {{IPA|/v/}} has evolved from unstressed {{IPA|/u/}} after the disappearance of the initial unstressed {{IPA|/a/}}. The evolution {{IPA|/u/}} > {{IPA|/v/}} should be relatively ancient, preventing the evolution of the following intervocalic {{IPA|/l/}} to {{IPA|/lː/}}. In [[Geg Albanian]] the toponym is pronounced ''Vlonë'', indicating that it has been in use among northern Albanians before the appearance of rhotacism in Tosk Albanian.<ref name="Demiraj">{{cite book|last=Demiraj|first=Shaban|author-link=Shaban Demiraj|publisher=[[Academy of Sciences of Albania]]|title=The origin of the Albanians: linguistically investigated|isbn=9789994381715|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXIbAQAAIAAJ|year=2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201120114336/https://books.google.com/books?id=aXIbAQAAIAAJ|archive-date=20 November 2020|pages=144–145}}</ref> Also the accent pattern of the name observes Albanian accent rules.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Huld|first=Martin E.|author-link=Martin E. Huld|title=Accentual Stratification of Ancient Greek Loanwords in Albanian|journal=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung|volume=99|issue=2|year=1986|publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht (GmbH & Co. KG)|jstor=40848841|pages=248–249}}</ref> The name itself of the inhabitants (sing. ''vlonjat'', pl. ''vlonjatë'') has not undergone the rhotacism affecting the toponym (if it had, it would look something like ''vlorat'' or ''vlorjat'').

The medieval and modern Greek name is ''Avlónas'' ({{lang|el|Αυλώνας}} ''Aulṓnas'' {{IPA-el|avˈlonas|}}, accusative {{lang|el|Αυλώνα}} ''Aulṓna'' {{IPA-el|avˈlona|}}), and is the source of the [[Latin]] ''Aulona'', the [[Italian language|Italian]] ''Valona'' (also used in other languages) and of the obsolete English ''Avlona''.<ref name="eb9">"{{Cite EB9|wstitle=Avlona}}" in the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', {{nowrap|9th ed.}} 1878.</ref>{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]] the city of Vlorë was known in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as ''Avlonya''.<ref>Gawrych, G.

Retrieved on August 25, 2009.</ref> In [[Medieval Latin]] sources  and in Old Italian records it is mentioned with the forms ''Avalona'', ''Avelona'', ''Lavalona'', ''Lavellona''; and in [[Old Serbian language|Old Serbian]] sources as ''Avlona'' or ''Vavlona'', the latter containing the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] preposition ''v'' "in".<ref name="Demiraj" /> In [[Aromanian language|Aromanian]], the city is known as {{lang|rup|Avlona}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://issuu.com/leogjata/docs/arumunet_albania_nr_40|title=Arumunët Albania, nr. 40|newspaper=Arumunët Albania|issue=40|page=15|year=2014|language=sq, rup}}</ref>

The coastal area of Vlorë was one of those [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] sites that had experienced pre-urban activity beginning from the 11th–10th centuries BCE.{{sfn|Bereti|1993|p=143}} During the period of [[Euboea#Antiquity|Euboea]]n colonization of the area (early 8th century BC) the bay of Vlorë was associated with several Heroic traditions and the foundation of several settlements there,<ref>{{cite book|last=Stocker|first=Sharon R.|title=Illyrian Apollonia: Toward a New Ktisis and Developmental History of the Colony|year=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tg8ynwEACAAJ|page=227|quote=Heroic origins that involved Euboeans were attributed toseveral other early settlements around the Bay of Vlora}}</ref> as the toponym Aulon suggest which is also known in local Eubean toponimity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walker |first1=Keith G. |title=Archaic Eretria: A Political and Social History from the Earliest Times to 490 BC |date=9 January 2004 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-45098-5 |page=151 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3yCAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA151 |language=en |quote=Eretrians settled around the bay of Avlona (Aulona)....

Due to its strategic position on the [[Adriatic Sea]], especially the [[Bay of Vlorë]], which forms a natural harbor, Vlorë occupied a significant place in [[classical antiquity]] as a base for trade by many peoples. Vlorë is considered one of the oldest cities in [[Albania]] and the region.{{efn|"town that is the second seaport of Albania.

''Aulon'', from which Vlorë took its name, was mentioned for the first time by [[Ptolemy]] (2nd century CE) among the towns of the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] [[Taulantii]].{{sfn|Bereti|Quantin|Cabanes|2011|pp=11, 13}} [[Carl Patsch]] proposed the first location of ''Aulon'' in Triport being then transferred to the current location of Vlora, and [[Pierre Cabanes]] proposed the location of ''Thronion'' in Triport; those identifications are not in contradiction with each other.{{sfn|Bereti|Quantin|Cabanes|2011|p=11}} Other geographical documents, such as the ''[[Tabula Peutingeriana]]'' and [[Hierocles (author of Synecdemus)|Hierocles]]' ''[[Synecdemus]]'', also mention Aulon.

Aulon (''Avlona'') became an [[episcopal see]] in the 5th century. Among the known bishops are ''Nazarius'' in 458 and ''Soter'' in 553 ([[Daniele Farlati]], ''Illyricum sacrum'', VII, 397–401). The diocese at that time belonged to the papal [[Pentarchy]]. In 733, it was annexed with the eastern [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], to the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Patriarchate of Constantinople]], and yet it is not mentioned in any ''[[Notitiae Episcopatuum]]'' of that Church. The bishopric had probably been suppressed for though the Bulgarians had been in possession of this country for some time, Avlona is not mentioned in the "Notitiae episcopatuum" of the [[Archbishopric of Ohrid|Bulgarian Archbishopric of Ohrid]].

During the Roman period, a [[Episcopal see|Latin see]] was established and Eubel (''Hierarchia catholica medii aevi'', I, 124) mentions several of its bishops.{{sfn|Vailhé|1912}}

Aulon, no longer being a residential bishopric, is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]], a [[suffragan bishop]] of [[Durrës]], being distinguished from a Greek titular see called Aulon by the use for it of the adjective ''Aulonitanus'', while the adjective regarding the Aulon in [[Euboea]] (Ionian [[Greece]]) is ''Aulonensis''.<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 842</ref> The diocese was nominally restored as Latin [[titular bishop]]ric Aulon, or Valona in Curiate Italian; from 1925 it was (als) named Aulona in Latin and/or Italian, since 1933 it's only Aulon in Latin, Aulona in Italian. It was a bishopric from the fifth century until Bulgarian rule.

The city of Vlorë remains a major seaport and commercial centre, with a significant [[fishing]] and [[Industrial sector|industrial]] sector. The surrounding region produces [[petroleum]], [[natural gas]], [[bitumen]] and [[salt]]. The city is also the location of important installations of the [[Albanian Navy]]. It has grown in importance as an agricultural center with a very large-scale planting of olive and fruit trees, and as a center of the food processing, oil, and bitumen export industries. Historically, the surrounding district was mainly agricultural and pastoral, producing oats, maize, cotton, olive oil, cattle, sheep, skins, hides, and butter.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} These commodities are exported.

Vlorë is a vibrant coastal city with a well-developed and modern housing infrastructure. The city offers a variety of residential areas ranging from the coast and going inland. Vlorë is divided into three economic zones.<ref>{{cite web|title=Albania is creating three free economic zones|url=http://emerging-europe.com/regions/albania-is-creating-three-free-economic-zones/|website=emerging-europe.com|language=en|date=24 August 2015}}</ref> The ''Free Economic Zone TEDA'' Vlorë has a strategic location, some {{convert|151|km|abbr=off}} away from the capital [[Tirana]]. The ''Land and Environmental Information'' is located in a flat, saline land, partially covered by ''Soda'' Forest. The area is suitable for industrial and environmentally friendly development. The ''Industrial development inside the zone'' eligible activities that can be developed in ''TEDA'' are: industrial, processing, commercial, goods storage, light industry, electronics, auto parts manufacturing, and port related activities. The ''Labor market'': Official data from 2014 reported the employable labor force in Vlora at 125,954, of which 84,836 are currently employed. 35% of the labor force in Vlora has a high school degree, while 17% has a university degree.

According to the [[World Bank]], Vlorë has made significant steps in the economy rankings in 2016. Vlorë ranks 7th among 22 cities in [[Southeastern Europe]] in rankings conducted by the [[World Bank Group]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.doingbusiness.org/Rankings/south-east-europe|title=Subnational Economy Rankings - South East Europe - Subnational Doing Business - World Bank Group|website=www.doingbusiness.org|access-date=15 March 2018}}</ref> ahead of the capital of [[Albania]], [[Tirana]], and also [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]] and [[Sarajevo]], in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].
