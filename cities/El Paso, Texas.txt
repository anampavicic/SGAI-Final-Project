{{For timeline}}

===Early years===

The El Paso region has had human settlement for thousands of years, as evidenced by [[Folsom point]]s from [[hunter-gatherer]]s found at [[Hueco Tanks]]. This suggests 10,000 to 12,000 years of human habitation.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/newsmedia/videos/state_park/big_bend_country/hueco_tanks.phtml|title=Hueco Tanks State Historic Site Videos Big Bend Country Region |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122072926/http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/newsmedia/videos/state_park/big_bend_country/hueco_tanks.phtml| url-status=dead| archive-date=November 22, 2007}}</ref> The earliest known cultures in the region were maize farmers. When the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] arrived, the [[Manso Indians|Manso]], [[Suma people|Suma]], and [[Jumano people|Jumano]] tribes populated the area. These were subsequently incorporated into the ''[[mestizo]]'' culture, along with immigrants from central Mexico, captives from [[Comanchería]], and ''[[genízaro]]s'' of various ethnic groups. The [[Mescalero Apache]] were also present.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_5YR_S0801&prodType=table|title=American FactFinder Commuting Characteristics by Sex|author=|first=|date=|website=factfinder.census.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190228070057/https://factfinder.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=ACS_17_5YR_S0801&prodType=table|archive-date=February 28, 2019|url-status=dead|access-date=February 26, 2019}}</ref>

The [[Chamuscado and Rodríguez Expedition]] trekked through present-day El Paso and forded the Rio Grande where they visited the land that is present-day New Mexico in 1581–1582. The expedition was led by Francisco Sánchez, called "El Chamuscado", and Fray Agustín Rodríguez, the first Spaniards known to have walked along the Rio Grande and visited the Pueblo Indians since Francisco Vásquez de Coronado 40 years earlier.  Spanish explorer [[Don Juan de Oñate]] was born in 1550 in [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas]], Mexico, and was the first [[New Spain]] (Mexico) explorer known to have rested and stayed 10 days by the [[Rio Grande]] near El Paso, in 1598,<ref>{{Cite book| title = El Paso Chronicles: A Record of Historical Events in El Paso, Texas | first = Leon C. | last = Metz | year = 1993 | publisher = El Paso: Mangan Press | isbn = 0-930208-32-3 }}</ref> celebrating a [[mass (liturgy)|Thanksgiving Mass]] there on April 30, 1598. Four survivors of the [[Narváez expedition]], [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]], [[Alonso del Castillo Maldonado]], [[Andrés Dorantes de Carranza]], and a Moor that was enslaved [[Estevanico]], are thought to have crossed the Rio Grande into present-day Mexico about 75 miles south of El Paso in 1535.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chipman |first1=Donald E. |title=Cabeza de Vaca, Álvar Núñez |url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/cabeza-de-vaca-lvar-nunez |website=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |access-date=24 April 2021}}</ref> El Paso del Norte (present-day [[Ciudad Juárez]]) was founded on the south bank of the Río Bravo del Norte (Rio Grande), in 1659 by [[Fray Garcia de San Francisco]]. In 1680, the small village of El Paso became the temporary base for Spanish governance of the territory of New Mexico as a result of the [[Pueblo Revolt]], until 1692, when [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] was reconquered and once again became the capital.<ref>Ramón A. Gutiérrez, ''When Jesus Came, the Corn Mothers Went Away: Marriage, Sexuality, and Power in New Mexico, 1500–1846'' (Stanford University Press, 1991) p. 145</ref>

The [[Texas Revolution]] (1836) was generally not felt in the region, as the American population was small, not more than 10% of the population. However, the region was claimed by Texas as part of the treaty signed with Mexico and numerous attempts were made by Texas to bolster these claims, but the villages that consisted of what is now El Paso and the surrounding area remained essentially a self-governed community with both representatives of the Mexican and Texan governments negotiating for control until Texas irrevocably took control in 1846.<ref name="elpaso7475"/> During this interregnum, 1836–1848, Americans nonetheless continued to settle the region. As early as the mid-1840s, alongside long extant Hispanic settlements such as the Rancho de Juan María Ponce de León, Anglo-American settlers such as [[Simeon Hart]] and [[Hugh Stephenson (early settler of El Paso, Texas) | Hugh Stephenson]] had established thriving communities of American settlers owing allegiance to Texas.<ref name="elpaso7475"/> Stephenson, who had married into the local Hispanic aristocracy, established the Rancho de San José de la Concordia, which became the nucleus of Anglo-American and Hispanic settlement within the limits of modern-day El Paso, in 1844: the Republic of Texas, which claimed the area, wanted a chunk of the Santa Fe trade. During the [[Mexican–American War]], the [[Battle of El Bracito]] was fought nearby on Christmas Day, 1846. The [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] effectively made the settlements on the north bank of the river part of the US, separate from Old El Paso del Norte on the Mexican side.<ref name="elpaso7475">''El Paso, A Borderlands History'', by W.H. Timmons, pp. 74, 75</ref> The present New Mexico–Texas boundary placing El Paso on the Texas side was drawn in the [[Compromise of 1850]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Drexler |first=Ken |title=Research Guides: Compromise of 1850: Primary Documents in American History: Introduction |url=https://guides.loc.gov/compromise-1850/introduction |access-date=2022-12-03 |website=guides.loc.gov |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-06-28 |title=Compromise of 1850 (1850) |url=https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/compromise-of-1850 |access-date=2022-12-03 |website=National Archives |language=en}}</ref>

El Paso remained the largest settlement in New Mexico as part of the Republic of Mexico until its cession to the U.S. in 1848, when the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo specified the border was to run north of El Paso De Norte around the [[Ciudad Juárez Cathedral]] which became part of the state of Chihuahua.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) |url=https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/treaty-of-guadalupe-hidalgo |access-date=February 7, 2023 |website=U.S. National Archives, Milestone Documents|date=June 25, 2021 }}</ref>

El Paso County was established in March 1850, with [[San Elizario, Texas|San Elizario]] as the first county seat.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/el-paso-tx#:~:text=El%20Paso%20County%20was%20established,largely%20ignoring%20history%20and%20topography. |title=El Paso |date=September 21, 2023|website=Handbook of Texas|access-date=December 15, 2023}}</ref> The United States Senate fixed a boundary between Texas and New Mexico at the 32nd parallel, thus largely ignoring history and topography. A military post called the "Post opposite El Paso" (meaning opposite El Paso del Norte, across the Rio Grande) was established in 1849 on Coons' Rancho beside the settlement of Franklin, which became the nucleus of the future El Paso, Texas; after the army left in 1851, the rancho went into default and was repossessed; in 1852, a post office was established on the rancho bearing the name El Paso as an example of [[cross-border town naming]] until El Paso del Norte was renamed Juarez in 1888. After changing hands twice more, the El Paso company was set up in 1859 and bought the property, hiring [[Anson Mills]] to survey and lay out the town, thus forming the current street plan of downtown El Paso.<ref name="handbook">{{Handbook of Texas | id=hde01 | name=El Paso, Texas}}</ref>

In ''Beyond the Mississippi'' (1867), [[Albert D. Richardson]], traveling to California via coach, described El Paso as he found it in late 1859: <blockquote>

The Texan town of El Paso had four hundred inhabitants, chiefly Mexicans. Its businessmen were Americans, but Spanish was the prevailing language. All the features were Mexican: low, flat adobe buildings, shading cottonwoods under which dusky, smoking women and swarthy children sold fruit, vegetables, and bread; habitual gambling universal, from the boys' game of pitching ''quartillas'' (three-cent coins) to the great saloons where huge piles of silver dollars were staked at monte. In this little village, a hundred thousand dollars often changed hands in a single night through the potent agencies of Monte and poker. There were only two or three American ladies, and most of the whites kept Mexican mistresses. All goods were brought on wagons from the Gulf of Mexico and sold at an advance of three or four hundred percent on Eastern prices.<ref name="Richardson 1867 238">{{Cite book|last=Richardson|first=Albert D.|title=Beyond the Mississippi : From the Great River to the Great Ocean|publisher=American Publishing Co.|year=1867|location=Hartford, Conn.|pages=238}}</ref></blockquote>

<blockquote>From hills overlooking the town, the eye takes in a charming picture—a far-stretching valley, enriched with orchards, vineyards, and cornfields, through which the river traces a shining pathway. Across it appears the flat roofs and cathedral towers of the old Mexican El Paso; still further, dim misty mountains melt into the blue sky.<ref name="Richardson 1867 238"/></blockquote>

During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] military forces were in the area until it was captured by the Union [[California Column]] in August 1862.

After the Civil War's conclusion, the town's population began to grow as white Texans continued to move into the villages and soon became the majority.

The location of El Paso and the arrival of these more wild newcomers caused the city to become a violent and wild [[boomtown]] known as the "Six-shooter Capital" because of its lawlessness.<ref name="handbook"/> Indeed, prostitution and gambling flourished until World War I when the [[Department of the Army]] pressured El Paso authorities to crack down on vice (thus "benefitting" vice in neighboring Ciudad Juárez). With the suppression of the vice trade and in consideration of the city's geographic position, the city continued into developing as a premier manufacturing, transportation, and retail center of the U.S. Southwest.<ref name="Elpasotexas.gov"/>

In 1909, the [[El Paso Chamber|El Paso Chamber of Commerce]] hosted U.S. President [[William Howard Taft]] and Mexican President [[Porfirio Díaz]] at a planned summit in El Paso, Texas, and Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, a historic first meeting between the Presidents of the two countries, and also the first time an American President crossed the border into Mexico.{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=1}} However, tensions rose on both sides of the border, including threats of assassination; so the [[Texas Rangers Division|Texas Rangers]], 4,000 U.S. and Mexican troops, U.S. Secret Service agents, FBI agents, and U.S. marshals were all called in to provide security.{{sfn|Harris|2009|p=15}} [[Frederick Russell Burnham]], a celebrated scout, was put in charge of a 250-strong private security detail hired by [[John Hays Hammond]], who in addition to owning large investments in Mexico, was a close friend of Taft from Yale and a U.S. vice presidential candidate in 1908.{{sfn|Hampton|1910}}{{sfn|Daily Mail|1909|p=7}} On October 16, the day of the summit, Burnham and Private C.R.

Spanish-language newspapers, theaters, movie houses, and schools were established, many supported by a thriving Mexican refugee middle class. Large numbers of clerics, intellectuals, and businessmen took refuge in the city, particularly between 1913 and 1915. Ultimately, the violence of the Mexican Revolution followed the large Mexican diaspora, who had fled to El Paso. In 1915 and again in 1916 and 1917, various Mexican revolutionary societies planned, staged, and launched violent attacks against both Texans and their political Mexican opponents in El Paso. This state of affairs eventually led to the vast [[Plan de San Diego]], which resulted in the murder of 21 American citizens.<ref name="TSHAPSD">{{cite web | url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ngp04 | publisher=Texas State Historical Association | title=Plan of San Diego | access-date=October 4, 2015| date=June 15, 2010 }}</ref> The subsequent reprisals by a local militia soon caused an escalation of violence, wherein an estimated 300 Mexicans and Mexican-Americans lost their lives. These actions affected almost every resident of the entire Rio Grande Valley, resulting in millions of dollars of losses; the result of the Plan of San Diego was long-standing enmity between the two ethnic groups.<ref name="TSHAPSD" />

Simultaneously, other Texans and Americans gravitated to the city, and by 1920, along with the U.S. Army troops, the population exceeded 100,000, and non-Hispanic Whites once again were in the clear majority. Nonetheless, the city increased the segregation between Mexicans and Mexican-Americans with non-Hispanic Whites. One prominent form of segregation, in the form of immigration controls to prevent disease, allegedly was abused to create [[Consent|nonconsensual]] [[Pornography|pornographic]] images of women distributed in local bars.<ref>{{Cite web |date=July 10, 2019 |title=John Carlos Frey: America's Deadly Stealth War on the Mexico Border Is Approaching Genocide |url=https://www.democracynow.org/2019/7/10/john_carlos_frey_sand_and_blood |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190713234210/https://www.democracynow.org/2019/7/10/john_carlos_frey_sand_and_blood |archive-date=July 13, 2019 |access-date=July 13, 2019 |website=[[Democracy Now!]]}}</ref> These rumors along with the perceived hazard from [[kerosene]] baths led to the [[1917 Bath riots]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=1917-01-29 |title=Women Force Anti-American Riot in Juarez (pt. 1) |volume=82 |pages=1 |work=Detroit Free Press |issue=124 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6582406/detroit-free-press/ |access-date=2022-11-08 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}</ref> As a result of the increased segregation, the Catholic Church attempted to garner the Mexican-American community's allegiance through education and political and civic involvement organizations, including the National Catholic Welfare Fund.<ref>{{Cite book| title = ''Mexicans "of the better class": The elite culture and ideology of Porfirian Chihuahua and its influence on the Mexican American generation, 1876–1936''| first = Víctor M. | last = Macías-González | year = 1995 | publisher = El Paso: UTEP }}</ref> In 1916, the Census Bureau reported El Paso's population as 53% Mexican and 44% Non-Hispanic whites.<ref>{{Cite book |editor-first=Emmons K. |editor-last=Ellsworth |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hF3JAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA4 |title=Special Census of the Population of El Paso, Tex: January 15, 1916 | publisher=United States Bureau of the Census |date=January 15, 1916 |access-date=July 1, 2010}}</ref> Mining and other industries gradually developed in the area. The [[El Paso and Northeastern Railway]] was chartered in 1897, to help extract the natural resources of surrounding areas, especially in southeastern New Mexico Territory.

In turn, as in the rest of the United States, the [[Depression era]] overall hit the city hard, and El Paso's population declined through the end of World War II, with most of the population losses coming from the non-Hispanic White community. Nonetheless, they remained the majority to the 1940s.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

During and following the war, military expansion in the area, as well as oil discoveries in the [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]], helped to engender rapid economic expansion in the mid-1900s. Copper smelting, [[Petroleum|oil]] refining, and the proliferation of low-wage industries (particularly garment making) led to the city's growth. Additionally, the departure of the region's rural population, which was mostly non-Hispanic White, to cities like El Paso, brought a short-term burst of capital and labor, but this was balanced by additional departures of middle-class Americans to other parts of the country that offered new and better-paying jobs. In turn, local businesses looked south to the opportunities afforded by cheap Mexican labor. Furthermore, the period from 1942 to 1956 had the [[bracero program]], which brought cheap Mexican labor into the rural area to replace the losses of the non-Hispanic White population. In turn, seeking better-paying jobs, these migrants also moved to El Paso. By 1965, Hispanics once again were a majority. Meanwhile, the postwar expansion slowed again in the 1960s, but the city continued to grow with the annexation of surrounding neighborhoods and in large part because of its significant economic relationship with Mexico.{{Citation needed|date=October 2013}}

El Paso is located within the [[Chihuahuan Desert]], the easternmost section of the [[Basin and Range Region]]. The [[Franklin Mountains (Texas)|Franklin Mountains]] extend into El Paso from the north and nearly divide the city into two sections; the west side forms the beginnings of the [[Mesilla Valley]], and the east side expands into the desert and lower valley. They connect in the central business district at the southern end of the mountain range.

The city's elevation is {{convert|3740|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. [[North Franklin Mountain]] is the highest peak in the city at {{convert|7192|ft|m|abbr=on}} above sea level. The peak can be seen from {{convert|60|mi|km|-2|abbr=on}} in all directions. Additionally, this mountain range is home to the famous natural red-clay formation, the Thunderbird, from which the local [[Coronado High School (El Paso, Texas)|Coronado High School]] gets its mascot's name. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|663.7|sqkm|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US4824000| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212204035/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US4824000| url-status=dead| archive-date=February 12, 2020| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): El Paso city, Texas| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| access-date=January 10, 2013}}</ref>

The {{convert|24000|acre|ha|adj=on}} [[Franklin Mountains State Park]], [[List of urban parks by size|one of the largest urban parks]] in the United States, lies entirely in El Paso, extending from the north and dividing the city into several sections along with Fort Bliss and [[El Paso International Airport]].

The [[Rio Grande Rift]], which passes around the southern end of the Franklin Mountains, is where the Rio Grande flows. The river defines the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juárez to the south and west until the river turns north of the border with Mexico, separating El Paso from [[Doña Ana County, New Mexico]]. [[Urbici Soler|Mt. Cristo Rey]], an example of a [[pluton]], rises within the Rio Grande Rift just to the west of El Paso on the New Mexico side of the Rio Grande.

El Paso's second-tallest building, the Wells Fargo Plaza, was built in the early 1970s as State National Plaza. The black-windowed, {{convert|302|ft|m|adj=on}}<ref name="elpasoinc.com" /> building is famous for its 13 white horizontal lights (18 lights per row on the east and west sides of the building, and seven bulbs per row on the north and south sides) that were lit at night. The tower did use a design of the United States flag during the [[Independence Day (United States)|July 4]] holidays, as well as the American hostage crisis of 1980, and was lit continuously following the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 until around 2006. During the Christmas holidays, a design of a Christmas tree was used, and at times, the letters "UTEP" were used to support University of Texas at El Paso athletics. The tower is now only lit during the holiday months, or when special events take place in the city.

El Paso Street and Paisano Dr. when the city was barely beginning. Today, central El Paso has grown into the center of the city's economy and a thriving urban community. It contains numerous historic sites and landmarks, mostly in the [[Sunset Heights]] district. It is close to the El Paso International Airport, the international border, and Fort Bliss. It is part of the [[El Paso Independent School District]].

Dr. James Day, an El Paso historian, said that downtown's main business area was originally centered between Second Avenue (now Paisano Drive) and San Francisco Avenue. At a later point, the main business area was centered around Stanton Street and Santa Fe Street. In the late 1800s, most of the [[White American]] residents lived to the north of the non-White areas, living in brick residences along Magoffin, Myrtle, and San Antonio Avenues. [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic-American]] residents lived in an area called [[Chihuahuita]] ("little [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]"), which was located south of Second Avenue and west of Santa Fe Street.

[[File:El Paso's Upper Valley.jpeg|thumb|right|El Paso's upper valley in northwest El Paso]]

Better known as West El Paso or the West Side, the area includes a portion of the Rio Grande floodplain upstream from downtown, which is known locally as the Upper Valley and is located on the west side of the [[Franklin Mountains (Texas)|Franklin Mountains]]. The Upper Valley is the greenest part of the county due to the Rio Grande. The West Side is home to some of the most affluent neighborhoods within the city, such as the Coronado Hills, Country Club, and Three Hills neighborhoods. It is one of the fastest-growing areas of El Paso. The main high schools in the westside include [[Canutillo High School]], [[Coronado High School (El Paso, Texas)]], and [[Franklin High School (El Paso, Texas)]].

===== West-central El Paso =====
{{main|West central El Paso}}
[[File:Madeline_Park_Kern_Place.jpg|thumb|Madeline Park in Kern Place]]
West-central El Paso is located north of Interstate 10 and west of the Franklin Mountains. [[The University of Texas at El Paso]] (UTEP) and the Cincinnati Entertainment district are located in the heart of the area. Historic districts [[Kern Place]] and [[Sunset Heights]] are in this part of town.

Kern Place was founded in 1914 by [[Peter E. Kern]], for whom the neighborhood was named.<ref name="Magruder-2004">{{Cite journal |last1=Magruder |first1=Alicia |last2=Dickey |first2=Gretchen |date=2004 |title=Kern Place Neighborhood: The Man Behind a Name |url=http://epcc.libguides.com/content.php?pid=309255&sid=2603479 |journal=Borderlands |volume=23}}</ref> The homes of Kern Place are unique in architecture and some were built by residents themselves.<ref name="Magruder-2004" /> One of the better known homes is the Paul Luckett Home located at 1201 Cincinnati Ave. above Madeline Park, and is made of local rock. It is known as "The Castle" due to its round walls and a crenelated rooftop.<ref name="Magruder-2004" />

Kern Place is extremely popular with college and university students. The area is known for its glitzy entertainment district, restaurants and coffee shops that cater to both business patrons and university students.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Gray |first=Robert |date=July 5, 2016 |title=Cincinnati Street claws back losses |url=http://www.elpasoinc.com/news/local_news/article_49533a06-42bc-11e6-829f-6f25b97ceb1f.html |access-date=May 2, 2017 |work=El Paso Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Gray |first=Robert |date=September 14, 2015 |title=Vacancies trouble Cincinnati district |url=http://www.elpasoinc.com/news/local_news/article_144844b4-5afa-11e5-ac50-0b49fe340843.html |access-date=May 2, 2017 |work=El Paso Inc.}}</ref> After UTEP's basketball and football games, UTEP fans pack the Kern Place area for food and entertainment at Cincinnati Street, a small bar district.

Young men and women make up the [[majority]] of the crowds who stop in between classes or after work.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Sunset Heights is one of the most historic areas in town, which has existed since the latter part of the 1890s. Many wealthy residents have had their houses and mansions built on this hill. Although some buildings have been renovated to their former glory,  many have been neglected and have deteriorated. During the Mexican Revolution, a widely popular Mexican revolutionary leader, [[Doroteo Arango]] (also known as [[Francisco "Pancho" Villa]]), owned and resided in this area during the 1910s.<ref>Worthington, Patricia.

===== Northeast El Paso =====
{{main|Northeast El Paso}}
[[File:Sugarloaff_Hill_at_sunset.jpg|thumb|right|A view of northeast El Paso from the Franklin Mountains]]
This part of town is located north of [[central El Paso]] and east of the Franklin Mountains. Development of the area was extensive during the 1950s and 1960s. It is one of the more ethnically diverse areas in the city due to the concentration of military families. The Northeast has not developed as rapidly as other areas, such as [[east El Paso]] and northwest El Paso, but its development is steadily increasing. The population is expected to grow more rapidly as a result of the troop increase at Ft. Bliss in the coming years. The area has also gained recognition throughout the city for the outstanding high-school athletic programs at [[Andress High School]], [[Parkland High School (Texas)|Parkland High School]], [[Irvin High School]], and [[Captain John L. Chapin High School|Chapin High School]].

In May 2021 a major developer announced plans for a Master Planned Community in the Northeast modeled after Scarborough's Sunfield Master Planned Community in Buda, Texas. The first phase of the development is to include about 2,500 homes, 10-acre park, walking trails, a four-acre resort-like area with a lazy river, kiddy splash pad, pool, grass areas, and a food truck area, the developers reported. Jessica Herrera, director of the city of El Paso Economic and International Development Department, in a statement released by the developers, said Campo del Sol will generate hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues, "which will stimulate other growth and development on the north side of town".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kolenc |first1=Vic |title=Billionaire Paul Foster ready to develop huge residential community in Northeast El Paso |url=https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/2021/05/25/paul-foster-to-develop-huge-residential-community-el-paso/7436410002/ |access-date=28 May 2021}}</ref>

===== East El Paso =====
{{main|East El Paso}}

The area is located north of Interstate 10, east of Airway Blvd., and south of Montana Ave. It is the largest and fastest growing area of town with a population over 200,000.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Census Explorer |url=https://www.census.gov/censusexplorer/censusexplorer.html |access-date=February 25, 2019 |website=census.gov}}</ref> It includes the 79936 ZIP Code, which was considered in 2013 as the most populous in the nation with over 114,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |year=2013 |title=The ZIP Code Turns 50 Today; Here Are 9 That Stand Out |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/07/01/197623129/the-zip-code-turns-50-today-here-are-9-that-stand-out |access-date=February 13, 2014 |publisher=NPR}}</ref>

===== Mission Valley =====
{{main|Mission Valley (El Paso)}}

Formerly known as the lower valley, it includes part of Eastside and all lower valley districts. It is the third-largest area of the city, behind east El Paso and central El Paso. Hawkins Road and Interstate 10 border the Mission Valley. This location is considered the oldest area of El Paso, dating back to the late 16th century when present-day Texas was under the rule of [[New Spain]].
[[File:YsletaMission.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ysleta Mission]]]]
In 1680, the Isleta Pueblo tribe revolted against the Spaniards who were pushed south to what is now El Paso. Some Spaniards and tribe members settled here permanently. Soon afterward, three Spanish missions were built; they remain standing, currently functioning as churches: [[Ysleta Mission]]-1682 (La Misión de Corpus Christi y de San Antonio de la Ysleta del Sur/Our Lady of Mt. Carmel), [[Socorro Mission]]-1759 (Nuestra Señora de la Purísima Concepción del Socorro)-1759, and [[San Elizario Chapel]] (Capilla de San Elcear)-1789.

On April 30, 1598, the northward-bound Spanish conquistadors crossed large sand dunes about 27 miles south of present-day downtown El Paso. The expeditionaries and their horses reportedly ran toward the river, and two horses drank themselves to death. [[Don Juan de Oñate]], a New Spain-born conquistador of Spanish parents, was an expedition leader who ordered a big feast north of the Río Grande in what is now San Elizario. This was the first documented and true Thanksgiving in North America.{{Citation needed|date=February 2021}} Oñate declared'' [[la Toma]]'' (taking possession), claiming all territory north of the Río Grande for King [[Philip II of Spain]].

[[Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo]] (related to the insurgent Isleta Pueblo Tribe) is also located in this valley. The Tigua is one of three Indian tribes in Texas whose sovereignty is recognized by the United States government. Ysleta is spelled with a "Y" because 19th-century script did not differentiate between a capital "Y" and a capital "I".

Some people in this area and its twin city across the river, Ciudad Juárez, are direct descendants of the Spaniards.

===== Texas and New Mexico suburbs =====
El Paso is surrounded by many cities and communities in both Texas and New Mexico. The most populated suburbs in Texas are [[Socorro, Texas|Socorro]], [[Horizon City, Texas|Horizon City]], Fort Bliss, and San Elizario. Other Texas suburbs are [[Anthony, Texas|Anthony]], [[Canutillo, Texas|Canutillo]], [[Sparks, Texas|Sparks]], [[Fabens, Texas|Fabens]], and [[Vinton, Texas|Vinton]].

Although [[Anthony, New Mexico|Anthony]], [[Santa Teresa, New Mexico|Santa Teresa]], [[Sunland Park, New Mexico|Sunland Park]], and [[Chaparral, New Mexico|Chaparral]] lie adjacent to El Paso County, they are considered to be part of the [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]] metropolitan area by the United States Census Bureau.<ref>[https://www.census.gov/population/estimates/metro-city/List4.txt.html] {{dead link|date=September 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

[[File:West_El_Paso_Sunset.jpg|thumb|upright|Sunset in [[West central El Paso|west El Paso]]]]
El Paso has a [[hot desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh'') featuring hot summers, with little humidity, and cool to mild, dry winters. Rainfall averages {{convert|8.8|in|abbr=on}} per year, much of which occurs from June through September, and is predominantly caused by the [[North American Monsoon]]. During this period, southerly and southeasterly winds carry moisture from the Pacific, the [[Gulf of California]], and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] into the region. When this moisture moves into the El Paso area and places to the southwest, orographic lift from the mountains, combined with strong daytime heating, causes [[thunderstorm]]s, some severe enough to produce flash flooding and hail, across the region.

The sun shines 302 days per year on average in El Paso, 83% of daylight hours, according to the [[National Weather Service]]; from this, the city is nicknamed "The Sun City".<ref>

With an average wind speed often exceeding {{convert|30|mi/h|-1|abbr=on}} and gusts that have been measured at over {{convert|75|mi/h|-1|abbr=on}}, these wind storms kick up large amounts of sand and dust from the desert, causing loss of visibility.
[[File:East El Paso.jpg|thumb|Palm trees in East El Paso]]
El Paso and the nearby mountains also receive snow. Weather systems have produced over {{convert|1|ft|cm|abbr=on}} of snow on several occasions. In the 1982–1983 winter season, three major snowstorms produced record seasonal snowfall. On December 25–26, 1982, {{convert|6.0|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow fell, producing a white Christmas for the city.<ref name=NOAA/> This was followed by another {{convert|7.0|in|cm|abbr=on}} on December 30–31, 1982. On April 4–7, 1983, {{convert|16.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow fell on El Paso, bringing the seasonal total to nearly {{convert|30|in|cm|abbr=on}}. On December 13–14, 1987, a record storm dumped over {{convert|22|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow on El Paso, and two weeks later (December 25–26), another {{convert|3|in|cm|abbr=on}} fell, bringing the monthly total for December 1987 to an all-time record high of {{convert|25.9|in|cm|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srh.noaa.gov/epz/?n=elpaso_heavy_snow|title=El Paso Heavy Snow Events|access-date=September 14, 2014}}</ref> of snow.<ref name=NCDC>{{cite web

The average annual snowfall for the city varies widely between different neighborhoods at different elevations, but is {{convert|2.6|in|cm|abbr=on}} at the airport (but with a median of 0, meaning most years see no snow at all).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/state-pdf/tx.pdf|title=National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) formerly known as National Climatic Data Center (NCDC) – NCEI offers access to the most significant archives of oceanic, atmospheric, geophysical and coastal data.|work=noaa.gov|access-date=July 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212022845/http://cdo.ncdc.noaa.gov/climatenormals/clim20/state-pdf/tx.pdf|archive-date=February 12, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> Snow is most rare around [[Ysleta]] and the eastern valley area, which usually include large numbers of [[palm trees]]; in the higher neighborhoods, palm trees are more vulnerable to snow and cold snaps and are often seen with brown, frost-damaged fronds.

One example of El Paso's varying climate at its most extreme was the damaging winter storm of early February 2011, which caused closures of schools, businesses, and City Hall. The snow, which was light, stopped after about a day, but during the ensuing cold episode, municipal utilities went into a crisis. The high temperature on February 2, 2011, was {{convert|15|°F|0}}, the lowest daily maximum on record. In addition, the low temperature on February 3 was {{convert|1|°F|0}}, breaking the {{convert|5|°F|0}} monthly record low set during the [[Great Blizzard of 1899#Arctic cold|cold wave of 1899]].<ref name=NOAA/> Loss of desert vegetation, such as Mexican/California palm trees, oleanders, and [[Aizoaceae|iceplant]]s to the cold weather was one of the results. Two local power plants failed, forcing El Paso Electric to institute [[rolling blackout]]s over several days,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kvia.com/news/rolling-blackouts-resume-friday-morning/53355261|title=Rolling Blackouts Resume Friday Morning|date=February 4, 2011|access-date=December 6, 2016|archive-date=December 20, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220074712/http://www.kvia.com/news/rolling-blackouts-resume-friday-morning/53355261|url-status=dead}}</ref> and electric wires were broken, causing localized blackouts. Many water utility pipes froze, causing areas of the city to be without water for several days.

Monthly means range from {{convert|46.1|°F|1}} in December to {{convert|84.4|°F|1}} in July, but high temperatures typically peak in June before the monsoon arrives, while daily low temperatures typically peak in July or early August with the higher humidity the monsoon brings (translating to warmer nights). On average,  42 night lows are at or below freezing, with 118 days of {{convert|90|°F|0}}+ highs and 28 days of {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ highs annually; extremely rarely do temperatures stay below the freezing mark all day.<ref name = NCDC /> The city's record high is {{convert|114|°F|0}} on June 30, 1994, and its record low is {{convert|−8|°F|0}} on January 11, 1962; the highest daily minimum was {{convert|85|°F|0}} on July 1 and 3, 1994, with weather records for the area maintained by the [[National Weather Service]] since 1879.

[[File:Wyler Aerial Tramway1.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wyler Aerial Tramway]] in the [[Franklin Mountains (Texas)|Franklin Mountains]] is the only commercial tramway in the state of [[Texas]].]]
The [[Wyler Aerial Tramway]] is operated by the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]] and is in the Franklin Mountains State Park. The tramway complex covers {{convert|196|acre|km2}} on the east side of the Franklin Mountains. The gondolas travel along two {{convert|2600|ft|m|adj=on}} {{frac|1|3|8}}-diameter steel cables to Ranger Peak, {{convert|5632|ft|m}} above sea level. The trip takes about four minutes and lifts riders {{convert|940|ft|m}} above the boarding area.The tramway was built in 1959 by [[KTSM-FM|KTSM]] radio to aid in the construction of a transmitter tower. Karl O. Wyler managed the project. First opening to the public as the El Paso Aerial Tramway, the facility provided rides from 1960 to 1986, when high liability insurance costs forced the tram to stop public operations. The tram was only used to service the transmitter towers. Wyler donated the tramway for public use in his will. The Texas Parks and Wildlife Department accepted the donation in 1997 and renovated and re-opened the tramway to the public in 2001. The tramway was closed indefinitely on September 18, 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tpwd.texas.gov/state-parks/wyler-aerial-tramway |title= Wyler Tramyway | publisher=Texas Parks and Wildflife Division |date=December 16, 2020 |access-date= December 16, 2020}}</ref>
[[File:Hueco Tanks Bouldering.jpg|thumb|right|Bouldering on North Mountain at [[Hueco Tanks]]]]
[[Hueco Tanks State Historic Site]] is a Texas historic site in the [[Hueco Tanks]] area, approximately {{convert|32|mi}} northeast of downtown El Paso and just west of the [[Hueco Mountains]]. The park is popular for recreation such as birdwatching and bouldering, and is culturally and spiritually significant to many Native Americans. This significance is partially manifested in the [[pictographs]] (rock paintings) that can be found throughout the region, many of which are thousands of years old.<ref>Mulvihill, K. [http://travel.nytimes.com/2008/09/19/travel/escapes/19Pict.html "On Rock Walls, Painted Prayers to Rain Gods"], ''[[The New York Times]]''. September 19, 2008. Retrieved 9/19/08.</ref> Hueco Tanks is also widely regarded as one of the best areas in the world for [[bouldering]] ([[rock climbing]], low enough to attempt without ropes for protection), unique for its rock type, the concentration and quality of the climbing, and after which the [[Grade (bouldering)|Hueco bouldering grades]] are named. In any given climbing season, which generally lasts from October through March, it is common for climbers from across Europe, Asia, and Australia to visit the park. Since implementation of the Public Use Plan, following a brief closure of the entire park due to the park service's inability to manage the growing crowds of international climbers, volunteer or commercial guides are required to access more than 2/3 of the park's area. Only North Mountain is accessible without guides, and then only for about 70 people at any given time. The park offers camping and showers for a small fee a day or, as is most popular for climbers, the nearby Hueco Rock Ranch offers camping where climbers can relax and socialize.

Located in downtown El Paso, [[San Jacinto Plaza]] is a historical park notable for its alligator statues in the middle of the area. Known as "Alligator Plaza", it used to have a pond that held live alligators that the community can interact with starting in 1962. They were removed and relocated to the [[El Paso Zoo]] in 1974. The area around the park is typically used to hold major events such as "Chalk the Block Arts Festival"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://chalktheblock.com/ |title= Chalk the Block | publisher=KVIA |date=December 16, 2020 |access-date= December 16, 2020}}</ref> and "Winterfest".

The [[Chamizal National Memorial]] is a 54.90-acre (22.22 ha) memorial park that serves primarily as a cultural center and contains art galleries, a theater, and an amphitheatre. A museum detailing the history of the Mexico–U.S. border is located inside the visitor center.

The city is also home to 242 municipal parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kvia.com/news/city-looking-at-cost-of-installing-rest-rooms-in-all-parks/31079332 |title=City Looking at Cost of Installing Restrooms in all Parks |publisher=KVIA |date=February 3, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |archive-date=February 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206204950/http://www.kvia.com/news/city-looking-at-cost-of-installing-rest-rooms-in-all-parks/31079332 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ktsm.com/news/city-revisit-rules-parks-bathrooms |title=City of El Paso to revisit rules for parks & bathrooms |publisher=KTSM |date=February 4, 2015 |access-date=February 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206204721/http://www.ktsm.com/news/city-revisit-rules-parks-bathrooms |archive-date=February 6, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

* The [[Centennial Museum and Chihuahuan Desert Gardens|Chihuahuan Desert Gardens]] (CDG) display the flora of the Chihuahuan Desert and adjacent regions in the United States and Mexico. The Gardens were formally dedicated in September 1999 and contain over 625 different species of plants, comprising one of the largest captive assemblages of Chihuahuan Desert flora in the world.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kohout|first=Martin Donnell|title=UTEP Centennial Museum|url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/lbe02|work=Handbook of Texas Online|publisher=Texas State Historical Association|access-date=February 23, 2012}}</ref>
* The El Paso Municipal Rose Garden (officially named the All-American Rose Selection (AARS) public garden) is one of over 100 certified gardens within the United States. There are over 1,900 rosebushes with 500 varieties. The wrought-iron fenced garden has wide walkways with handicap accessibility, raised beds, a waterfall, and trees and shrubs. Several new rose varieties are planted each year, and after two years the highest-rated are named and receive the AARS symbol.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://txmg.org/elpaso/projects/rose-garden/|title=El Paso Municipal Rose Garden|date=August 27, 2018|website=Keystone Heritage Park}}</ref>
* Feather Lake is a {{convert|43.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} wildlife sanctuary based on a {{convert|40|acre|ha|adj=on}} wetland built by the City of El Paso in 1969 as a stormwater-[[retention basin]]. Since 1976, the El Paso/Trans-Pecos Audubon Society has leased this land from the city and managed it for wildlife. Over 200 different species of birds, especially those associated with water, have been observed at the sanctuary. Fauna residing there include [[muskrats]], [[spiny softshell turtle]]s, [[pond slider]]s, and [[Aspidoscelis inornatus heptagrammus|Trans-Pecos striped whiptail lizards]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.trans-pecos-audubon.com/feather-lake.html|title=Feather Lake|date=August 23, 2018|website=El Paso/Trans-Pecos Audubon Society}}</ref>
* Keystone Heritage Park comprises an Archaic-period archaeological site, wetlands, and a desert botanical garden. The 4,500-year-old site is one of the oldest villages in the United States. The wetlands are home to many birds, and over 200 species have been spotted there on their seasonal migrations. The botanical garden features a variety of native plants, and includes a pavilion and a replica of an Archaic period brush hut. The newest component, The Chihuahuan Desert Experience, is a work in progress that will allow visitors to stroll the {{convert|900|mi|km|adj=on}} length of desert over a {{convert|17|acre|ha|adj=on}} recreation of the plant indigenous life.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://keystoneheritagepark.com/about-the-keystone-heritage-park/|title=About the Keystone Heritage Park|date=August 17, 2018|website=Texas A&M Agrilife Extension}}</ref>
* Rio Bosque Wetlands is a {{convert|372|acre|ha|adj=on}} city park, managed by the Center for Environmental Resource Management of the [[University of Texas at El Paso]], which began restoration efforts in 1998. In the fall and winter, water flows through the park along the route of the river before it was confined within levees in the 1930s. Many animals and birds have returned to the area as the restoration proceeds, and over 200 species of birds have been sighted.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://research.utep.edu/default.aspx?tabid=65792|title=Rio Bosque Wetlands Park |date=August 29, 2018|website=Center For Environmental Resource Management, The University of Texas at El Paso}}</ref>

===City===

The city government is officially nonpartisan. Mayors and city council members are elected for four year terms and may not serve more than two full terms or for more than 10 years total in their respective offices.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elpasotexas.gov/muni_clerk/_documents/2004_Charter_Election_Resolution.pdf |title=Resolution Canvassing Results of the 2004 City Charter Amendment Election And Declaring Adoption To Amendments of City Charter |publisher=City of El Paso |date=February 7, 2004 |access-date=May 10, 2009 |archive-date=September 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928025953/http://www.elpasotexas.gov/muni_clerk/_documents/2004_Charter_Election_Resolution.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> Municipal elections were held in May in odd-numbered years until a voter-approved charter amendment changed this to November in even-numbered years, beginning in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_23223038/el-paso-city-charter-amendments-5-9-propositions |title=El Paso City Charter amendments: 6 of 9 propositions approved |newspaper=El Paso Times |date=May 12, 2013 |access-date=January 3, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130630203044/http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_23223038/el-paso-city-charter-amendments-5-9-propositions |archive-date=June 30, 2013  }}</ref>

The city operates under a council–manager form of government. Power is concentrated in the eight-member elected city council and mayor, who hire a manager to carry out its directives and oversee the delivery of public services. The current city manager is Cary Westin, who holds the position on an interim basis, and the current [[List of mayors of El Paso, Texas|mayor of El Paso]] is [[Oscar Leeser]], who was elected to the office in 2020 (Leeser served an earlier non-consecutive term from 2013 to 2017).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_23520595/ballpark-guarantee-push-rejected |title=El Paso Downtown ballpark-guarantee push rejected |newspaper=El Paso Times |date=June 23, 2013 |access-date=June 26, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130624221950/http://www.elpasotimes.com/news/ci_23520595/ballpark-guarantee-push-rejected |archive-date=June 24, 2013  }}</ref>
The terms of Leeser, Acevedo, Hernandez, Molinar, and Rivera will end in January 2025. The terms of Canales, Fierro, Kennedy, and Salcido will end in January 2027, but Kennedy and Salcido are leaving office in January 2025 due to their mayoral runs.

Hernandez and Rivera have been on the council since 2017; Salcido since 2019; Molinar since 2021; Canales, Fierro, and Kennedy since 2023; Acevedo since 2024.

===Radio stations===
Radio stations from [[Las Cruces, New Mexico]], and [[Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua]], can also be heard within the El Paso market.

===Television===
El Paso was the largest city in the United States without a PBS television station within the city limits until 1978. El Paso viewers had to watch channel 22, [[KRWG-TV|KRWG]], from [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]] until 1978. In fact, the city had only three English-speaking channels and two Spanish-language channels (channel 2 and channel 5) from Juarez, and cable TV subscribers in the 1970s and 1980s could receive four [[Los Angeles]] independent channels: [[KTLA]], [[KCAL-TV|KHJ]], [[KTTV]] and [[KCOP]] as well as Spanish-language stations [[KMEX]] of Los Angeles and [[KWEX]] of [[San Antonio]] usually sharing the same cable channel slot. Over time, as more television stations signed on, more cable channels were added and those stations added network affiliations, the Los Angeles and San Antonio stations disappeared from the lineup. The last to be removed was KTLA in the fall of 2006 as a consequence of the [[2006 United States broadcast TV realignment|WB-UPN merger]] into [[The CW Television Network|The CW]], when [[KVIA-TV]] launched a digital subchannel with the network's programming.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Historically, El Paso and Ciudad Juarez had a shared [[streetcar]] system with a peak electrified route mileage of {{Convert|64|mi|km}} in 1920. The first electrified line across the Rio Grande, which opened on January 11, 1902, was preceded by a network that relied on animal labor. The system quickly spread into residential and industrial areas of El Paso. In 1913, a {{Convert|12|mi|km|adj=on}} [[interurban]] line was built to Ysleta. At the close of 1943, the holding company [[El Paso Electric]] sold its subsidiary, the El Paso Electric Railway Company and its Mexican counterpart, to one of [[National City Lines]]' subsidiaries. This resulted in the formation of El Paso City Lines, whose domestic streetcar lines were replaced by buses in 1947.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Myrick|first=David F.|title=New Mexico's Railroads: An Historical Survey| publisher=Colorado Railroad Museum |location=Golden|year=1970|pages=189–190}}</ref> The international streetcar line which crossed the border via the Stanton Street Bridge continued to operate until 1973. In 1977, El Paso City Lines and two other bus companies were bought by the municipality and merged to form Sun City Area Transit (SCAT). In 1987, SCAT restyled itself Sun Metro.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.elpasotexas.gov/sunmetro/sunhis.asp|title=El Paso Mass Transit History|publisher=City of El Paso|access-date=November 22, 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603074144/https://www2.elpasotexas.gov/sunmetro/sunhis.asp|archive-date=June 3, 2010}}</ref>

====International border crossings====
[[File:Bridge of the Americas (El Paso–Ciudad Juárez), June 2016.jpg|thumb|The Bridge of the Americas as seen from El Paso, Texas, in June 2016]]

The first bridge to cross the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte was built in the time of [[Nueva España]], over 250 years ago, from wood hauled in from Santa Fe.<ref>Paul Horgan, ''Great River: The Rio Grande in North American History''. Volume 1, Indians and Spain. Vol. 2, Mexico and the United States. 2 Vols. in 1, 1038 pages – Wesleyan University Press 1991, 4th Reprint, {{ISBN|0-8195-6251-3}}</ref> This bridge is honored by the modern [[Paso del Norte International Bridge|Santa Fe Street Bridge]], and Santa Fe Street in downtown El Paso.

*[[Good Neighbor International Bridge]], also known as the Stanton Street Bridge
*[[Paso del Norte International Bridge]], also known as the Santa Fe Street Bridge.
