Its capital city is [[La Asunción]], and the main urban center is [[Porlamar]].

== Etymology ==
[[File:Museo del Hombre Insular (1).jpg|right|thumb|Colonial architecture at the Museum of the Insular Man]]
Its name, Nueva [[Sparta, Laconia|Esparta]] ("''New Sparta"''), comes from the heroism shown by its inhabitants during the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]], deemed similar to that of the [[Sparta]]n soldiers of [[Ancient Greece]].{{cn|date=January 2023}}

==History==
===Spanish colonization===
Margarita was discovered on August 15, 1498 during [[Columbus voyages|Columbus' third voyage]]. On that trip the Admiral would also discover mainland Venezuela. That day, Columbus saw three islands, two of them small, low and arid (the current Coche and Cubagua), separated by a channel from a third, larger one, covered with vegetation and populated by indigenous people who called it ''Paraguachoa'', a word that means "fish in abundance" according to historians, and "sea people" according to others.

Columbus named the island ''La Asunción'', because it was discovered on the religious date of the Virgin that bears his name. The following year, in 1499, [[Pedro Alonso Niño]] and Cristóbal Guerra renamed it ''La Margarita'', due to the abundance of pearls found in the region; other hypotheses suggest that the name Margarita refers to Queen Margarita of Austria-Styria.

Shortly after its discovery, other European sailors confirmed the existence of rich pearl deposits in Cubagua, whose exploitation gave rise to the first Spanish establishment in Venezuela. According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas, in 1500, only 2 years after his sighting, there were already 50 adventurers installed in Cubagua who were eagerly looking for the precious mother-of-pearl gems used by the natives in their personal ornaments. This settlement of small Spanish villages for the exploitation of these pearl riches in [[Cubagua]] consisted of Cabildo and Regidores by 1510. But the settlement was carried out in this early date spontaneously without following Hispanic patterns, since even in 1517, it is indicated that the population resided in awnings and huts.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

At first, all official attempts to achieve the colonization of Cubagua failed: the problem of water supply was paramount, and it was concluded that the establishment of a village in Cubagua could not bear fruit without the previous construction of a fortress at the mouth of the river of today's Cumaná, which was the one that supplied the water.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

[[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo y Valdés]]' version that the establishment of Cubagua dates back to 1517 is considered correct. Under the protection of the Cumaná fortress, which was finally built in early 1523, the village of Cubagua was quickly organized and an extraordinary boom emerged in the exploitation of pearl pleasures.

[[File:Casa de Mariño, corredor interno y tejado.jpg|right|thumb|[[El Valle del Espíritu Santo#Santiago Mariño Museum|Santiago Mariño Museum]]]]
It is unlikely that before 1525, the residents of the village of Cubagua were aware of being a town or city. None of the pearl records from 1521 to 1525, which are the first known local sources of Cubagua, mention the name of the village on this island, and only speak of Cubagua.

In 1526, the town was elevated to the category of Villa with the name of "''Villa de Santiago de Cubagua''", although it seems that this title was never used. On September 13, 1528 this town was granted the rank of city, was given a coat of arms, the first ordinances were issued granting the city political autonomy and its name was changed to "''[[Nueva Cádiz]]''". Through these ordinances, the city of Nueva Cádiz, today recognized as the first city of Venezuela, did not depend on Spanish aid from Santo Domingo, and could trade directly with Castile. This helped the inhabitants of Nueva Cádiz to stimulate their activity. They set about building their city, replacing the huts with stone houses, material brought from Araya, and increasing the number of inhabitants.

Between 1531 and 1532, the pearly beds showed the first signs of exhaustion. The growing population with scarce means of living, created in New Cadiz problems of supply of food, water and firewood. Foodstuffs arrived from Santo Domingo, water from the Manzanares River in [[Cumaná]], and firewood was transported from Isla Margarita. When pearls were scarce, they sought new fisheries, and with the authorization of the Royal Court of Santo Domingo and King Carlos I, they moved to Cabo de la Vela.

The disappearance of the Cubagua population was a slow process due mainly to the lack of water, the resistance of the Indians to the exhausting work of the pearl fisheries, and to the conquests of distant lands. The visit of the French [[French corsairs|corsairs]] meant a serious threat to the survival of the city. Likewise, caribbean boats prowled the contours of the island. However, the fundamental cause of Cubagua's depopulation was the disappearance of the oyster beds.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

The population did not migrate all at once. Coinciding with the boom in fisheries in Cubagua there is already a migration to Cabo de la Vela, because there were not enough of them in Cubagua. By 1537, the island was becoming depopulated and in 1541, history indicates that a hurricane hit the island, possibly following an earthquake, and its inhabitants fled to Margarita and founded a town. In 1543, French [[Piracy|pirates]] arrived at the ruins of Nueva Cádiz, where some 10 inhabitants still remained, and left the city in flames, causing the island to be abandoned once again.

[[File:Iglesia de La asuncion.jpg|right|thumb|[[La Asunción Cathedral]], the first building was built by the Spanish in 1571 and destroyed by the French in 1602]]
Although the exact date of its total abandonment by the [[Spaniards]] in this early period is not known, history indicates that by 1545, a group of residents of Nueva Cádiz aspire to incorporate Margarita under their jurisdiction, which confirms the existence of a population on the island at least for that date.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

In 1676, the Marquis of Maitenon with a fleet of 10 ships and 800 French [[Buccaneer|buccaneers]] attacked Margarita Island and Cumaná. This action motivated the Spanish to build several forts on the island.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

The [[Province of Margarita]] is the oldest of those that in 1777 formed the [[Captaincy General of Venezuela]]. It had depended on the [[Real Audiencia of Santo Domingo|Royal Audience of Santo Domingo]] until 1739, when it was annexed to the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]], along with other States; and in 1830, when the Republic of Venezuela emerged, it was one of its 13 original provinces.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

===19th and 20th centuries===
In the Church of Santa Ana, an Assembly of Notables was held on May 6, 1816, in which the [[Third Republic of Venezuela]] was proclaimed as a single and indivisible nation: the Provisional Government of the Republic was established, the General [[Simón Bolívar]] proclaimed the Supreme Chief of the Republic, General [[Santiago Mariño]] was appointed second in command, and various military promotions are made. Bolívar signs the repeal of the Death War Decree of 1813. Inside the Church, the chair where General Bolivar sat down still remains, and monuments to those who participated in the assembly.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

In 1835, the province of Margarita was divided into the cantons of La Asunción (composed of the parishes of Paraguachí, Pampatar, Los Robles, El Valle and Porlamar) and Norte (composed of the parishes of Tacarigua, Juangriego, San Juan, Pedro González and Sabana Grande).

In 1856, the province of Margarita was divided into the cantons of Norte (composed of the parishes of Norte, Juangriego, Tacarigua, Pedro González, Los Hatos, Pedregales, San Juan and the islands of Tortuga, Blanquilla, Testigos and Aves de Barlovento), with its capital in [[Santa Ana, Nueva Esparta|Santa Ana del Norte]], and Sur (composed of the parishes of Asunción, Pampatar, Porlamar, Paraguachí, Espíritu Santo, Robles, and Sabana Grande), with its capital in La Asunción.

In 1864, when the country was divided into 20 states and a Federal District, Margarita took the name of Estado Nueva Esparta ("State of New Sparta").  The republic granted the title of "Nueva Esparta" to the island territory because of the heroism shown by the island's inhabitants in the struggle for Venezuela's independence, which resembled the Spartans of classical Greece. The complete exhaustion of the Cubagua pearl oysters in 1857 determined the abandonment of this island, and afterwards, it was visited by fishermen who built ''rancherías'' (ranches). In 1881, it became a section of the Great State of Guzmán Blanco (called Miranda from 1889 to 1898). In 1901, two years after the autonomy of the states was restored, it regained the name of Nueva Esparta, but lost it again between 1904 and 1909, during which time it was included in the Federal District as an Eastern Section. Finally, in 1909, it regained its statehood and in 1948, the island of Cubagua was annexed to its territory.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

== Geography ==
[[File:Manglares La Restinga.JPG|thumb|right|[[Laguna de la Restinga]]]]
The main island of Margarita has an area of {{cvt|1,020|km2}}.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-UYNAAAAYAAJ&q=km2+isla+de+margarita&pg=PP12|title=Atlas básico del estado Nueva Esparta|date=1997|publisher=República de Venezuela, Ministerio del Ambiente y de los Recursos Naturales Renovables, Región Nueva Esparta|language=es}}</ref> Its capital city is [[La Asunción]]. The main urban center is [[Porlamar]]. Other important towns are [[Juan Griego]], [[Pampatar]] (home of the Port Authority), [[Punta de Piedras, Nueva Esparta|Punta de Piedras]], [[San Juan Bautista, Nueva Esparta|San Juan Bautista]], Las Guevaras, Las Hernández, Villa Rosa, Bella Vista (Margarita), and [[El Valle del Espíritu Santo]].

Nueva Esparta is located between the [[coordinates]] 10º44, 11º10` of North latitude and 63º (degrees) 46` (minutes), 64º13` of West longitude, in the insular region of the country.

The State is limited in all its cardinal points by the Caribbean Sea.

Together, the three islands of the State bring together magnificent beaches, wonderful mangroves and other landscapes that make it a true island paradise. Margarita, the largest of them, has a maximum elevation on Copey Hill (900 meters above sea level) and includes the Macanao mountain core to the west. Coche and Cubagua are rocky cores covered with marine sediments and have a flat relief, with cliffs. The climate is arid or semi-arid, to the point that there are no permanent current rivers. The Nueva Esparta state is divided into 11 municipalities.

===Municipalities===
{{Nueva Esparta}}

===Geology===
The state territory is characterized by events of volcanism, sedimentation, emersion, deposition and uprising. Igneous-metamorphic rocks of the Mesozoic era form the foundation of the mountainous areas and their foothills, including the hill landscape, with the exception of the undulating reliefs of Pampatar, constituted by tertiary sediments, as well as the coastal plain. The lowest marine areas are [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]] formations, composed of alluviums, coastal and alluvial terraces, calcareous sandstones and lagoon deposits. Coche and Cubagua are rocky cores covered with marine sediments from the Pre-Cambrian geological era

===Relief===
The eastern sector of Margarita Island has three small [[mountain ranges]], aligned in a southeast–northwest direction, whose altitude stops are the Copey,<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Gómez-Cano|first1=Grisel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aBQAEAAAQBAJ&q=cerro+copey+isla+de+margarita&pg=PT8|title=Isla De Margarita: Nuestra Herencia Gómez – Ortega|last2=Rodriguez|first2=Eduardo A. Navarro|date=June 18, 2020|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|isbn=978-1-7960-9528-9|language=en}}</ref> Matasiete, La Guardia and Guayamurí hills; To the southwest, the relief is flat, with the exception of moderate elevations, known as Las Tetas de María Guevara. The Macanao Peninsula, in the western sector, has an elongated east–west massif, between the Macanao and Guarataro hills. The rest are coastal plains that descend towards wide-ranging beaches. The islands of Coche and Cubagua offer a flat terrain with some cliffs.

The relief is composed of coastal plains, lagoons and mountain ranges. The coastal plains of the eastern massif descend to oceanic beaches of great breadth and white sands that constitute a great tourist attraction, also conducive to sports and recreation activities.

===Hydrography===
There are no significant permanent water currents, but thin rivers lately seasonal due to climatic changes that have raised temperatures throughout the planet in recent years. Dry most of the year and with torrential in short periods of rain. Of these, the main ones are San Juan (San Juan poses), San Francisco, La Asunción, El Valle, Chaguaramal, El Muco, La Vieja, Negro and Tacarigua.

The lagoons of [[Laguna de la Restinga|La Restinga]], Los Mártires and [[Laguna de Las Marites Natural Monument|Las Marites]], together with the hot springs of the Holy Spirit Valley and the San Francisco sector, complete a scarce, insufficient and unsuitable [[Hydrography|hydrographic system]] to supply the local population with potable water.

===Climate===
[[File:El Yaque en la tarde.JPG|right|thumb|[[Playa El Yaque]], Margarita Island]]
Nueva Esparta has a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]], with microclimates ranging from very warm arid to warm-moderate semi-arid. The semi-arid climate dominates in Margarita. In Porlamar, the rainfall is only {{convert|399|mm|inch|0|disp=or}} annually with an average temperature of {{convert|27|°C|°F|0|disp=or}}. The areas with the highest rainfall are located in the Serranía de El Copey, reaching {{convert|1100|mm|inch|0|disp=or}} per year. This, together with local fogs, allows the development of cloud forests, which derive on lower slopes in formations of premontane dry forests. Precipitation is lower in the Macanao Peninsula, ranging from {{convert|300|to|500|mm|inch|0|disp=or}} annually, with temperatures from {{convert|27|to|28|°C|°F|0|disp=or}}. In Coche, the average annual temperature is also high with rainfall of {{convert|512|mm|inch|0|disp=or}} annually. Dry conditions are rigorous in Cubagua with only {{convert|250|mm|inch|0|disp=or}} of rainfall per year, qualifying as a [[desert climate#Hot desert climates|hot arid climate]]. If it is considered that in the coastal and beach sites, such as Porlamar, there are only 66 days of appreciable rainfall per year, the optimal conditions for various types of tourism are experienced. Some examples of its climate are Cerro Copey, [[Laguna de la Restinga]], Macanao peninsula, and the islands of Coche and Cubagua.

On rare occasions, tropical cyclones affect the islands of the state due to their low latitude. Some cyclones that have affected the islands either directly or indirectly have been [[Hurricane Joan–Miriam]] in 1988 and [[Tropical Storm Bret (1993)|Tropical Storm Bret]] in 1993.

===Soils===
The soil is thin and underdeveloped, subject to an intense erosive process due to [[overgrazing]]. The oscillations of the sea level and the deforestation carried out for agricultural use contribute to this. The valleys' soils, the best quality lands, are well developed, have an organic layer, are protected from the erosive action of the wind and are covered with vegetation, but only occupy a small proportion of the state. In the areas of Piedmont, the cones of injection and colluvial materials give rise to very stony soils. The islands of Coche and Cubagua have soils with salinity and strong erosion, resulting from the action of the winds, which gives their surface layer a stony character.

===Vegetation===
[[File:Vista al Valle del Espiritu Santo - panoramio.jpg|right|thumb|[[El Valle del Espíritu Santo]]]]
On Margarita Island, the climatic and / or edaphic effects have produced a mixture of life zones, with varied ecosystems that range from tropical desert weeds, in low and dry areas, to thorny mountains and tropical dry forest in areas of greater height. In the Copey hill is the premontane humid forest and in the swampy and saline areas mangroves abound. The most representative species are olive trees, [[divi-divi]] and pardillo, around the hills Matasiete, El Copey, and Guaraguao. The very dry forest is in areas of very intervened vegetation. The main species are: cují, guatacare, guamache, cardón, divisive and olive. The spines and desert weeds, dominant formations of the state, occupy the coastal plains. Its main species are abrojo, cují, yaque, oregano, naked Indian, prickly pear, cardon, divisive, guamache and others. Mangrove concentrations are located in [[Laguna de la Restinga|La Restinga]], [[Laguna de Las Marites Natural Monument|Las Marites]] and other coastal water areas. The most important species are the red mangrove, button and the black mangrove.

Most of the state presents a vegetation corresponding to the insular coastal subregion of the type:
* Halophilic Coastal Herbazales: in low, open communities, in saline depressions of the coast, floristically poor (glass, glass grass, rabbit broom).
* Herbazales Litorales Psamófilos: (yerba de grama – Batatilla de Playa).
* Coastal [[Xerophile|Xerophilic]] shrubs: Cují, Yaque, Cuica, Yabo, Palo Verde, Guatacaro, Gatacare, yaguarey or cord data, Guasabara, Guasabano, Tuna Guafabora, Guayacán.
* Coastal Mangroves: red mangrove, black mangrove, pink mangrove, white mangrove, button mangrove and the corresponding to the Copey mountain range.
* Low to Medium Forests: Puy, Curaro, Aragüaney, Egg Yolk, Naked Indian, Indian Hide, Torco, White Spoon, Lemongrass.
* Sub-evergreen Submontane Ombrophile Forests: Aragüaney, Chaparro Bobo, Guamo, Palmito, Palmiche, Macanilla.
*Evergreen Dwarf Submontane shrubs: Cup, White Butter.
* Agricultural and Urban Lands: natural vegetation has been removed or altered in such a way that it is no longer recognizable as such.

===Fauna===
[[File:Cardinalis phoeniceus from Venezuela.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Cardinalis phoeniceus]]'' from Margarita Island]]
Fauna in the region include:
* Mammals: cottontail rabbit, red-tailed squirrel, white-tailed deer, skunk, ocelot, tufted capuchin, and nine-banded armadillo.
* Birds: chachalaca, troupial, partridge, cardinal, dove
* Reptiles: iguana, rattlesnake, coral snake, anoles
