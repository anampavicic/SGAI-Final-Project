Crete is located about {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the [[Peloponnese]], and about {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Anatolia]]. Crete has an area of {{convert|8450|km2|mi2|abbr=on}} and a coastline of 1,046&nbsp;km (650&nbsp;mi). It bounds the southern border of the [[Aegean Sea]], with the [[Sea of Crete]] (or North Cretan Sea) to the north and the [[Libyan Sea]] (or South Cretan Sea) to the south. Crete covers 260 km from west to east but is narrow from north to south, spanning three longitudes but only half a latitude.

Crete and a number of islands and islets that surround it constitute the Region of Crete ({{langx|el|Περιφέρεια Κρήτης|links=no}}), which is the southernmost of the 13 [[Modern regions of Greece|top-level administrative units of Greece]], and the fifth most populous of Greece's regions. Its capital and largest city is [[Heraklion]], on the north shore of the island. {{As of|2021}}, the region had a population of 624,408.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Population on 1 January by NUTS 2 region|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tgs00096/default/table?lang=en|url-status=live|website=Statistics Eurostat|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121060511/https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/tgs00096/default/table?lang=en |archive-date=21 January 2021 }}</ref> The [[Dodecanese]] are located to the northeast of Crete, while the [[Cyclades]] are situated to the north, separated by the [[Sea of Crete]]. The [[Peloponnese]] is to the region's northwest.

Crete was the center of [[Europe]]'s first advanced civilization, the [[Minoan civilization|Minoans]], from 2700 to 1420 BC. The Minoan civilization was overrun by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]] from mainland Greece. Crete was later ruled by Rome, then successively by the [[Byzantine Empire]], [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] Arabs, the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian Republic]], and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1898 Crete, whose people had for some time wanted to join the Greek state, achieved independence from the Ottomans, formally becoming the [[Cretan State]]. Crete became part of Greece in December 1913.

The island is mostly mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east. It includes Crete's highest point, [[Mount Ida (Crete)|Mount Ida]], and the range of the [[Lefka Ori|White Mountains]] (Lefka Ori) with 30 summits above {{Convert|2000|m|ft}} in altitude and the [[Samaria Gorge]], a [[World Biosphere Reserve]]. Crete forms a significant part of the economy and cultural heritage of Greece, while retaining its own local cultural traits (such as its own [[Mantinada|poetry]] and [[Cretan music|music]]). The [[Heraklion International Airport, "Nikos Kazantzakis"|Nikos Kazantzakis]] airport at Heraklion and the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at [[Chania]] serve international travelers. The [[Minoan palace]] at [[Knossos]] is also located in Heraklion.<ref name="Ancient Crete">[http://oxfordbibliographiesonline.com/display/id/obo-9780195389661-0071 Ancient Crete] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200530225110/http://oxfordbibliographiesonline.com/display/id/obo-9780195389661-0071 |date=30 May 2020 }} Oxford Bibliographies Online: Classics</ref>

==Name==
{{Hiero|''Keftiu''|<hiero>kA:Z1-I9-U33-Z7-N25</hiero>Crete|era=egypt|align=left}}
The earliest references to the island of Crete come from texts from the [[Syria]]n city of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] dating from the [[18th century BC|18th century]] BC, where the island is referred to as ''Kaptara''.<ref>Stephanie Lynn Budin, ''The Ancient Greeks: An Introduction'' (New York: Oxford UP, 2004), 42.</ref> This is repeated later in [[Neo-Assyrian]] records and the [[Bible]] (''[[Caphtor]]''). It was known in ancient [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] as {{lang|egy-Latn|Keftiu}} or {{lang|egy-Latn|kftı͗w}}, strongly suggesting a similar [[Minoan language|Minoan]] name for the island.<ref>O. Dickinson, ''The Aegean Bronze Age'' (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 1994), 241–244.</ref>

The current name ''Crete'' is first attested in the 15th century BC in [[Mycenaean Greek]] texts, written in [[Linear B]], through the words {{lang|gmy-Latn|ke-re-te}} ({{lang|gmy|{{Script|Linb|𐀐𐀩𐀳}}}}, {{lang|grk-x-proto|*Krētes|script=Latn}}; later Greek: {{lang|grc|Κρῆτες}} {{IPA-grc|krɛː.tes|}}, plural of {{lang|grc|Κρής}} {{IPA-grc|krɛːs|}})<ref>Found on the [[Pylos|PY]] An 128 tablet.</ref> and {{lang|gmy-Latn|ke-re-si-jo}} ({{lang|gmy|{{Script|Linb|𐀐𐀩𐀯𐀍}}}}, {{lang|grk-x-proto|*Krēsijos|script=Latn}}; later Greek: {{lang|grc|Κρήσιος}} {{IPA-grc|krέːsios|}},<ref>Found on the [[PY Ta 641]] and PY Ta 709 tablets.</ref> 'Cretian').<ref>{{cite web |title=The Linear B word ''ke-re-si-ji'' |website=Palaeolexicon |url=http://www.palaeolexicon.com/ShowWord.aspx?Id=16779 }}</ref><ref>{{LSJ|*krh/s|Κρής}}, {{LSJ|krhsi/ai|Κρήσιος s.v. κρησίαι|ref}}.</ref> In [[Ancient Greek]], the name Crete ({{lang|grc|Κρήτη}}) first appears in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]''.<ref>Book 14, line 199; Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek–English Lexicon''</ref> Its etymology is unknown. One proposal derives it from a hypothetical [[Luwian language|Luwian]] word {{lang|xlu-Latn|*kursatta}} (compare {{lang|xlu-Latn|kursawar}} 'island', {{lang|xlu-Latn|kursattar}} 'cutting, sliver').<ref>Edwin L.

Mikalson (Wauconda, Ill.: Bolchazy-Carducci, 1998), 62.</ref> Another proposal suggests that it derives from the [[ancient Greek]] word ''"κραταιή" (krataie̅)'', meaning strong or powerful, the reasoning being that Crete was the strongest [[thalassocracy]] during ancient times.<ref>{{Cite web|last=|date=2018-12-08|title=Τι σημαίνει το όνομα "Κρήτη" τελικά και γιατί ονομάστηκε έτσι το νησί μας;|url=https://www.daynight.gr/kriti/krhth-etymologia-onomatos/|url-status=live|access-date=2021-07-14|website=Daynight.gr|language=el|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210714201715/https://www.daynight.gr/kriti/krhth-etymologia-onomatos/ |archive-date=14 July 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Λελάκης|first=Γεώργιος|title=Αιγαίο-ετυμολογίες νήσων|year=2008|language=Greek}}</ref>

In [[Classical Latin|Latin]], the name of the island became {{Lang|la|Creta}}. The original Arabic name of Crete was {{Lang|ar-Latn|Iqrīṭiš}} ({{langx|ar|اقريطش}} < {{lang|grc|(τῆς) Κρήτης)}}, but after the [[Emirate of Crete]]'s establishment of its new capital at {{lang|ar|ربض الخندق}} {{Lang|ar-Latn|Rabḍ al-Ḫandaq}} (modern [[Heraklion]]; {{langx|el|Ηράκλειο}}, {{lang|el-Latn|Irákleio}}), both the city and the island became known as {{lang|grc-x-medieval|Χάνδαξ}} ({{Lang|el-Latn|Chandax}}) or {{lang|grc-x-medieval|Χάνδακας}} ({{Lang|el-Latn|Chandakas}}), which gave Latin, Italian, and Venetian {{lang|vec|Candia}}, from which were derived French {{lang|fr|Candie}} and English ''Candy'' or ''Candia''. Under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman rule]], in [[Ottoman Turkish]], Crete was called {{lang|ota-Latn|Girit}} ({{lang|ota|كريد}}). In the Hebrew Bible, Crete is referred to as ({{lang|he|כְּרֵתִים}}) "kretim".

Crete is the largest island in Greece and the fifth largest island in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. It is located in the southern part of the [[Aegean Sea]] separating the Aegean from the [[Libyan Sea]].

===Island morphology===

The island has an elongated shape: it spans {{convert|260|km|mi|abbr=on}} from east to west, is {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} at its widest point, and narrows to as little as {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} (close to [[Ierapetra]]). Crete covers an area of {{convert|8336|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, with a coastline of {{convert|1046|km|mi|abbr=on}}; to the north, it broaches the [[Sea of Crete]] ({{langx|el|Κρητικό Πέλαγος|links=no}}); to the south, the [[Libyan Sea]] ({{langx|el|links=no|Λιβυκό Πέλαγος}}); in the west, the [[Myrtoan Sea]], and toward the east the Carpathian Sea. It lies approximately {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the Greek mainland.

There are a number of peninsulas and gulfs on the north side of Crete, from west to east these include: [[Gramvousa Peninsula|Gramvousa]] peninsula, gulf of Kissamos, Rodopos peninsula, [[gulf of Chania]], [[Akrotiri, Crete|Akrotiri]] peninsula, [[Souda Bay]], Apokoronas cape, gulf of [[Almyros|Almiros]], gulf of [[Heraklion]], Aforesmenos cape, gulf of [[Mirabello Bay|Mirabello]], gulf of [[Sitia]] and the [[Cape Sideros|Sideros]] peninsula. On the south side of Crete is the gulf of [[Messara Plain|Messaras]] and [[Cape Lithinon]].

===Mountains and valleys===
<!--Linked from [[:Category:Mountains of Crete]]-->

Crete is mountainous, and its character is defined by a high mountain range crossing from west to east, formed by six different groups of mountains:
*The White Mountains or [[Lefka Ori]] {{convert|2453|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*The Idi Range ([[Psiloritis]]) {{convert|2456|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*[[Asterousia Mountains]] {{convert|1231|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*[[Mount Kedros|Kedros]] {{convert|1777|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*The [[Dikti|Dikti Mountains]] {{convert|2148|m|ft|abbr=on}}
*[[Thrypti]] {{convert|1489|m|ft|abbr=on}}

These mountains lavish Crete with valleys, such as [[Amari Valley|Amari valley]], fertile plateaus, such as [[Lasithi Plateau|Lasithi plateau]], [[Omalos]] and [[Nidha]]; caves, such as [[Gourgouthakas]], [[Diktaion]], and [[Idaion]] (the birthplace of the ancient Greek god [[Zeus]]); and a number of gorges.

The mountains have been seen as a key feature of the island's distinctiveness, especially since the time of Romantic travellers' writing. Contemporary Cretans distinguish between highlanders and lowlanders; the former often claim to reside in places affording a higher/better climatic and moral environment. In keeping with the legacy of Romantic authors, the mountains are seen as having determined their residents' 'resistance' to past invaders which relates to the oft-encountered idea that highlanders are 'purer' in terms of less intermarriages with occupiers. For residents of mountainous areas, such as [[Sfakians|Sfakia]] in western Crete, the aridness and rockiness of the mountains is emphasised as an element of pride and is often compared to the alleged soft-soiled mountains of others parts of Greece or the world.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame: Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=23–58 |url=http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=809810 |access-date=2 October 2019 |archive-date=16 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191216181203/http://www.iupress.indiana.edu/product_info.php?products_id=809810 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Gorges, rivers and lakes===
The island has a number of gorges, such as the [[Samariá Gorge]], [[Imbros Gorge]], [[Kourtaliotiko Gorge]], [[Ha Gorge]], [[Platania Gorge]], the Gorge of the Dead (at [[Kato Zakros]], [[Sitia]]) and [[Richtis Gorge]] and (Richtis) waterfall at Exo Mouliana in [[Sitia]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/Gorges/Lassithi-gorges/kato-zakros-gorge-deads-gorge/ |title=Gorge of the Dead |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |access-date=13 September 2012 |archive-date=25 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425235509/http://www.cretanbeaches.com/Gorges/Lassithi-gorges/kato-zakros-gorge-deads-gorge/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |title=Richtis gorge |publisher=Cretanbeaches.com |access-date=13 September 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120731062158/http://www.cretanbeaches.com/en/gorges-of-crete/gorges-in-lassithi-prefecture/641-richtis-gorge.html |archive-date=31 July 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://candia.wordpress.com/photos/photo-2010/richtis-gorge-april-2010/ |title=Richtis beach and gorge |publisher=Candia.wordpress.com |date=20 April 2010 |access-date=13 September 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldreviewer.com/travel-guides/canyon/richtis-gorge-and-waterfall/61078/ |title=Richtis gorge and waterfall |publisher=Worldreviewer.com |date=25 February 2011 |access-date=13 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181012185413/http://www.worldreviewer.com/travel-guides/canyon/richtis-gorge-and-waterfall/61078/ |archive-date=12 October 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The rivers of Crete include the [[Ieropotamos River|Geropotamos River]], the Koiliaris, the Anapodiaris, the Almiros, the Giofyros, the Keritis, and Megas Potamos. There are only two freshwater lakes in Crete: [[Lake Kournas]] and [[Lake Agia]], which are both in [[Chania (regional unit)|Chania regional unit]].<ref>[http://www.crete.tournet.gr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1155&lang=en Photos of Agia Lake] Crete TOURnet.</ref> [[Lake Voulismeni]] at the coast, at Aghios Nikolaos, was formerly a freshwater lake but is now connected to the sea, in [[Lasithi]].<ref>[http://www.aghiosnikolaos.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=24&Itemid=35 Lake Voulismeni] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720152021/http://www.aghiosnikolaos.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=24&Itemid=35 |date=20 July 2011 }} aghiosnikolaos.eu</ref> Three artificial lakes created by dams also exist in Crete: the lake of [[Aposelemis Dam]], the lake of Potamos Dam, and the lake of Mpramiana Dam.

A large number of islands, [[Islet|islets]], and rocks hug the coast of Crete. Many are visited by tourists, some are only visited by [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] and [[biologist]]s. Some are [[Environmental protection|environmentally protected]]. A small sample of the islands includes:
*[[Gramvousa]] ([[Kissamos]], Chania) the pirate island opposite the Balo lagoon
*[[Elafonisi]] (Chania), which commemorates a shipwreck and an Ottoman massacre
*[[Chrysi (island)|Chrysi]] island ([[Ierapetra]], [[Lasithi]]), which hosts the largest natural ''[[Juniperus macrocarpa]]'' forest in Europe
*[[Paximadia]] island (Agia Galini, [[Rethymno]]) where the god Apollo and the goddess Artemis were born
*The Venetian fort and leper colony at [[Spinalonga]] opposite the beach and shallow waters of [[Elounda]] ([[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]], Lasithi)
*[[Dionysades]] islands which are in an environmentally protected region together with the Palm Beach Forest of [[Vai (Crete)|Vai]] in the municipality of [[Sitia]], Lasithi

Off the south coast, the island of [[Gavdos]] is located {{convert|26|nmi|km|0}} south of [[Hora Sfakion]] and is the [[Extreme points of Europe|southernmost]] point of [[Europe]].

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Greece}}
Crete straddles two climatic zones, the [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] and the [[semi-arid climate]], mainly falling within the former. As such, the climate in Crete is primarily a [[hot-summer mediterranean|hot-summer Mediterranean]] (''Csa'') climate while some areas in the [[Lentas#Climate|south]] and east have a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BSh''). The higher elevations fall into the warm-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] category (''Csb'')<ref>{{Cite web |title=Latest Conditions in Xyloskalo, Chania, Crete Island |url=https://penteli.meteo.gr/stations/samaria/ |access-date=2023-07-03 |website=penteli.meteo.gr}}</ref> while the mountain peaks (>2,000 meters) might feature a cold-summer [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csc'') or a [[continental climate]] (''Dfb'' or ''Dfc''). The atmosphere can be quite humid, depending on the proximity to the sea, while winter is fairly mild. Snowfall is common on the mountains between November and May, but rare in the low-lying areas.

[[File:Flag harbour Chania Crete Greece.jpg|thumb|250px|Flag harbour Chania, Crete, Greece]]
The south coast, including the [[Mesara Plain]] and [[Asterousia Mountains]], falls in the North African climatic zone, enjoying significantly more sunny days and high temperatures throughout the year. There, [[date palm]]s bear fruit, and [[Swallow (bird)|swallows]] remain year-round rather than migrate to [[Africa]].

Crete with its nearby islands form the '''Crete Region''' ({{langx|el|Περιφέρεια Κρήτης|translit=}}, {{Lang|el-Latn|Periféria Krítis}}, {{IPA-el|periˈferia ˈkritis|}}), one of the 13 [[Modern regions of Greece|regions of Greece]] which were established in the 1987 administrative reform.<ref>Π.Δ. 51/87 "Καθορισμός των Περιφερειών της Χώρας για το σχεδιασμό κ.λ.π. της Περιφερειακής Ανάπτυξης" (''Determination of the Regions of the Country for the planning etc. of the development of the Region'', [[Efimeris tis Kyverniseos|ΦΕΚ]] A 26/06.03.1987</ref> Under the 2010 [[Kallikratis plan]], the powers and authority of the regions were redefined and extended. The region is based at [[Heraklion]] and is divided into four [[regional units of Greece|regional units]] (pre-Kallikratis [[prefectures of Greece|prefectures]]). From west to east these are: [[Chania (regional unit)|Chania]], [[Rethymno (regional unit)|Rethymno]], [[Heraklion (regional unit)|Heraklion]], and [[Lasithi]]. These are further subdivided into 24 [[Municipalities of Greece|municipalities]].

Since 1 January 2011, the regional governor is [[Stavros Arnaoutakis]] of the [[PASOK|Panhellenic Socialist Movement]]. First elected in [[2010 Greek local elections|2010]], he was re-elected in [[2014 Greek local elections|2014]], [[2019 Greek local elections|2019]] and [[2023 Crete regional election|2023]].

===Cities===
{{Main|Cities of Greece}}

[[Heraklion]] is the largest city and capital of Crete, holding more than a fourth of the island's population. [[Chania]] was the capital until 1971. The principal cities are:

===Economy===
{{Further|Economy of Greece}}

The economy of Crete is predominantly based on services and tourism. However, agriculture also plays an important role and Crete is one of the few Greek islands that can support itself without a tourism industry.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=z3vxvYOZkj4C&pg=PR11 The rough guide to Crete, Introduction, p. ix] by J. Fisher and G. Garvey.</ref> The economy began to change visibly during the 1970s as tourism gained in importance. Although an emphasis remains on agriculture and stock breeding, because of the climate and terrain of the island, there has been a drop in manufacturing, and an observable expansion in its service industries (mainly tourism-related). All three sectors of the Cretan economy (agriculture/farming, processing-packaging, services), are directly connected and interdependent. The island has a per capita income much higher than the Greek average, whereas unemployment is at approximately 4%, one-sixth of that of the country overall.{{citation needed|date=December 2021}}{{when|date=December 2021}}

As in many regions of Greece, [[viticulture]] and [[olive]] groves are significant; [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], [[Greek citron|citrons]] and [[avocado]]es are also cultivated. Until recently {{when|date=February 2024}} there were restrictions on the import of bananas to Greece, therefore bananas were grown on the island, predominantly in greenhouses. Dairy products are important to the local economy and there are a number of specialty cheeses such as [[mizithra]], [[anthotyros]], and [[kefalotyri]].

20% of Greek wine is produced in Crete, mostly in the region of Peza. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.crete.org.uk|title=Crete information|website=Crete}}</ref>

The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was €9.4 billion in 2018, accounting for 5.1% of Greek economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was €17,800 or 59% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 68% of the EU average. Crete is the region in Greece with the fifth highest GDP per capita.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref>

===Transport infrastructure===
{{See also|Transportation in Crete}}
====Airports====
The island has three significant airports, [[Heraklion International Airport, "Nikos Kazantzakis"|Nikos Kazantzakis]] at Heraklion, the [[Chania International Airport|Daskalogiannis]] airport at Chania and the smaller [[Sitia Public Airport|Sitia]] airport. The first two serve international routes, acting as the main gateways to the island for travellers. Work has begun plan to replace Heraklion airport with a new airport at [[Kasteli Airport|Kasteli]], where there is presently an air force base, and the new Kasteli Airport is due to open by 2027.

====Ferries====
The island is well served by ferries, mostly from [[Port of Piraeus|Piraeus]], by ferry companies such as [[Minoan Lines]] and [[ANEK Lines]] with links to the [[Cyclades]] and [[Dodecanese]] islands. [[Seajets]] also operates routes to [[Cyclades]]. 

The main ports from west to east are at [[Kissamos]] (ferry link to Peloponnese), [[Souda]] (Chania), [[Rethymno]], [[Heraklion]] (links to Cyclades), [[Agios Nikolaos, Crete|Agios Nikolaos]] and [[Sitia]] (link to Dodecanese).

[[File:Kreta - Europastraße75 2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[A90 motorway (Greece)|A90 motorway]] near [[Malia, Crete|Malia]]]]

Most of Crete is served by the road network. A modern highway is currently being upgraded along the north coast connecting the four major cities ([[A90 motorway (Greece)|A90 motorway]]), the sections bypassing the main cities (Heraklion to Malia, Rethymno, Chania to Kolymvari) are at motorway standard, while the sections in between, and west to Kissamos and east to Sitia, should be completed by 2028. A link will also connect to the new [[Kasteli Airport|Kasteli international airport]] .<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/regional_policy/en/projects/greece/new-road-in-crete-set-to-improve-journey-times-and-safety|title=New road in Crete set to improve journey times and safety-Projects|website=ec.europa.eu|language=en|access-date=18 January 2018}}</ref> 

In addition, a [[European Union]] study has been devised to promote a modern highway to connect the northern and southern parts of the island via a [[tunnel]]. The study proposal includes a {{Convert|15.7|km|mi|abbr=on}} section of road between the villages of Agia Varvara and Agia Deka in central Crete. The new road section forms part of the route between [[Messara Plain|Messara]] in the south and Crete's largest city [[Heraklion]], which houses the island's biggest airport and ferry links with mainland [[Greece]].

====Railway====
Also, during the 1930s there was a narrow-gauge industrial railway in Heraklion, from Giofyros in the west side of the city to the port. There are now no railway lines on Crete. The government is planning the construction of a line from Chania to Heraklion via Rethymno.<ref name="books.google.gr">Rackham, O. & Moody, J., 1996.

===Development===
The construction sector in Crete responded well during the pandemic and has come out strong in the post-recession recovery period. Total construction spending recovered and is expected to peak a record high (approximately 8% higher than 2019 average levels) signalling consistent expansion in construction projects and real estate investments in Crete.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Thomas |first=Stavros |date=2022-01-20 |title=Construction Activity in Crete - Key Trends And Prospects to 2022 |url=https://arencos.com/construction-activity-in-crete-key-trends-and-prospects-to-2022/ |access-date=2023-01-16 |website=ARENCOS}}</ref> The evolution of the private sector in Crete is tightly linked with the demand for tourism-related investments. Moreover, the recovery of the tourism sector is expected to lead to further growth in housing prices and rental demand.

Newspapers have reported that the Ministry of Mercantile Marine is ready to support the agreement between Greece, [[South Korea]], [[Dubai Ports World]] and [[China]] for the construction of a large international [[container (cargo)|container]] port and [[free trade zone]] in southern Crete near [[Tympaki]]; the plan is to expropriate {{Convert|850|ha|acre|abbr=on}} of land. The port would handle two&nbsp;million containers per year, but the project has not been universally welcomed because of its environmental, economic and cultural impact.<ref name=ncp>[http://www.no-container-port-in-timbaki.net/facts_en.php No Container Transshipment Hub in Timbaki] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070123131440/http://www.no-container-port-in-timbaki.net/facts_en.php |date=23 January 2007 }}.

[[File:Knossos Westbastion 05.jpg|250px|alt=|thumb|[[Minoan palace]] of [[Knossos]]]]

In the later Neolithic and Bronze Age periods, under the Minoans, Crete had a highly developed, literate civilization. It has been ruled by various ancient Greek entities, the [[Roman Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]], the [[Emirate of Crete]], the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After a brief period of independence (1897–1913) under a provisional Cretan government, it joined the Kingdom of Greece. It was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] during the [[Second World War]].

===Prehistory===
{{Main|Prehistoric Crete}}
Stone tools suggest that [[archaic humans]] may have visited Crete as early as 130,000 years ago, but there is no evidence of permanent settlement of the island until the [[Neolithic]], around 7,000 BCE.<ref>{{Citation |last=Day |first=Jo |title=Crete, Archaeology of |date=2018 |url=http://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-319-51726-1_1434-2 |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Global Archaeology |pages=1–18 |access-date=2023-05-08 |place=Cham |publisher=Springer International Publishing |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-51726-1_1434-2 |isbn=978-3-319-51726-1}}</ref> Settlements dating to the [[aceramic]] Neolithic in the 7th millennium BC, used [[cattle]], [[Domestic sheep|sheep]], [[Domestic goat|goat]]s, [[pig]]s and [[dog]]s as well as domesticated [[cereal]]s and [[legume]]s; ancient [[Knossos]] was the site of one of these major Neolithic (then later Minoan) sites.<ref>C.

===Minoan civilization===
{{Main|Minoan civilization}}

During the [[Bronze Age]], Crete was the centre of the [[Minoan culture|Minoan civilization]], notable for its [[Minoan art|art]], its writing systems such as [[Linear A]], and for its massive building complexes including the palace at [[Knossos]]. Its economy benefited from a network of trade around much of the [[Mediterranean]], and Minoan cultural influence extended to [[Cyprus]], [[Canaan]], and [[Egypt]]. Some scholars have speculated that [[Greek mythology|legends]] such as that of the [[minotaur]] have a historical basis in Minoan times.

===Mycenaean civilization===
{{Main|Mycenaean Greece}}
In 1420&nbsp;BC, the Minoan civilization was subsumed by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean civilization]] from mainland Greece. The oldest samples of writing in the Greek language, as identified by [[Michael Ventris]], is the Linear B archive from Knossos, dated approximately to 1425–1375&nbsp;BC.<ref>{{cite web|first=Cynthia|last=Shelmerdine|title=Where Do We Go From Here?

=== Archaic and Classical period ===

After the [[Bronze Age collapse]], Crete was settled by new waves of Greeks from the mainland. A number of city states developed in the [[Archaic Greece|Archaic period]]. There was limited contact with mainland Greece, and [[Greek historiography]] shows little interest in Crete, as a result, there are few literary sources.

During the 6th to 4th centuries BC, Crete was comparatively free from warfare. The [[Gortyn code]] (5th century BC) is evidence for how codified [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] established a balance between aristocratic power and civil rights.

In the late 4th century BC, the aristocratic order began to collapse due to endemic infighting among the elite, and Crete's economy was weakened by prolonged wars between city states. During the 3rd century BC, [[Gortyn]], Kydonia ([[Chania]]), [[Lyctus|Lyttos]] and [[Polyrrhenia]] challenged the primacy of ancient Knossos.

While the cities continued to prey upon one another, they invited into their feuds mainland powers like [[Macedon]] and its rivals [[Rhodes]] and [[Ptolemaic Egypt]]. In 220 BC the island was tormented by a [[Lyttian War|war between two opposing coalitions of cities]]. As a result, the Macedonian king [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip V]] gained [[hegemony]] over Crete which lasted to the end of the [[Cretan War (205–200 BC)]], when the [[Rhodes|Rhodians]] opposed the rise of Macedon and the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] started to interfere in Cretan affairs.

In the 2nd century BC Ierapytna ([[Ierapetra]]) gained supremacy on eastern Crete.

===Roman rule===
{{Main|Crete and Cyrenaica}}
Crete was involved in the [[Mithridatic Wars]], initially repelling an attack by Roman general [[Marcus Antonius Creticus]] in 71&nbsp;BC. Nevertheless, a ferocious three-year campaign soon followed under [[Quintus Caecilius Metellus Creticus (died 55&nbsp;BC)|Quintus Caecilius Metellus]], equipped with three legions. Crete was conquered by Rome in 69&nbsp;BC, earning for Metellus the title "''Creticus''". [[Gortyn]] was made capital of the island, and Crete became a Roman province, along with [[Cyrenaica]] that was called [[Creta et Cyrenaica]]. Archaeological remains suggest that Crete under Roman rule witnessed prosperity and increased connectivity with other parts of the Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jane Francis and Anna Kouremenos |title=Roman Crete: New Perspectives |date=2016 |publisher=Oxbow |location=Oxford |isbn=978-1785700958}}</ref> In the 2nd century AD, at least three cities in Crete (Lyttos, Gortyn, Hierapytna) joined the [[Panhellenion]], a league of Greek cities founded by the emperor [[Hadrian]]. When [[Diocletian]] redivided the Empire, Crete was placed, along with Cyrene, under the [[diocese of Moesia]], and later by [[Constantine I]] to the [[diocese of Macedonia]].

===Byzantine Empire – first period===
{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}

[[File:Crete MoniArkadiou1 tango7174.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Arkadi Monastery]]]]

Crete was separated from Cyrenaica {{circa|297}}. It remained a province within the eastern half of the Roman Empire, usually referred to as the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire after the establishment of a second capital in Constantinople by Constantine in 330. Crete was subjected to an attack by [[Vandals]] in 467, the great earthquakes of [[365 Crete earthquake|365]] and 415, a raid by [[Slavs]] in 623, Arab raids in 654 and the 670s, and again in the 8th century. In {{circa|732}}, the Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian]] transferred the island from the jurisdiction of the [[Pope]] to that of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].{{sfn|Gregory|Kazhdan|1991|p=546}}

===Arab rule===

{{Main|Emirate of Crete}}

[[File:The Cretan Saracens defeat the Byzantines under Damianos.jpg|thumb|250px|The Byzantines, under the general Damian, attacked Crete but were defeated by the Saracens, {{circa|828}}, as depicted by [[John Skylitzes|Ioannes Scylitzes]] (see [[Skylitzes Chronicle]]).]]

In the 820s, after 900 years as a Roman island, Crete was captured by Andalusian [[Muwallad]]s led by [[Abu Hafs (pirate)|Abu Hafs]],<ref name="Iberia">Reinhart Dozy, ''Histoire des Musulmans d'Espagne: jusqu'à la conquête de l'Andalousie par les Almoravides'' (French) pg. 711–1110, Leiden, 1861 & 1881, 2nd edition</ref> who established the [[Emirate of Crete]]. The Byzantines launched a campaign that took most of the island back in 842 and 843 under [[Theoktistos]]. Further Byzantine campaigns in 911 and 949 failed. In 960–61, [[Nikephoros II|Nikephoros Phokas]]' [[Siege of Chandax|campaign]] restored Crete to the Byzantine Empire, after a century and a half of Arab control.

===Byzantine Empire – second period===
{{Main|Byzantine Crete}}

In 961, [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]] returned the island to Byzantine rule after expelling the Arabs.{{sfn|Panagiotakis|1987|p=XVI}} Extensive efforts at conversion of the populace were undertaken, led by [[John Xenos]] and [[Nikon the Metanoeite|Nikon "the Metanoeite"]].{{sfn|Gregory|Kazhdan|1991|pp=545–546}}{{sfn|Treadgold|1997|p=495}} The reconquest of Crete was a major achievement for the Byzantines, as it restored Byzantine control over the Aegean littoral and diminished the threat of [[Saracen]] pirates, for which Crete had provided a base of operations.

In 1204, the [[Fourth Crusade]] seized and sacked the imperial capital of [[Constantinople]]. Crete was initially granted to leading Crusader [[Boniface of Montferrat]]{{sfn|Panagiotakis|1987|p=XVI}} in the partition of spoils that followed. However, Boniface sold his claim to the [[Republic of Venice]],{{sfn|Panagiotakis|1987|p=XVI}} whose forces made up the majority of the Crusade. Venice's rival the [[Republic of Genoa]] immediately seized the island and it was not until 1212 that Venice secured Crete as a colony.

===Venetian rule===

[[File:I Creta - Buondelmonti Cristoforo - 1420.jpg|thumb|250px|right|upright|Fifteenth century map by [[Cristoforo Buondelmonti|Buondelmonti]].]]

From 1212, during [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]'s rule, which lasted more than four centuries, a [[Renaissance]] swept through the island as is evident from the artistic works dating to that period. Known as [[The Cretan School]] or [[Post-Byzantine Art]], it is among the last flowerings of the artistic traditions of the fallen empire. This included the painter [[El Greco]] and the writers [[Nicholas Kalliakis]] (1645–1707), [[Georgios Kalafatis (professor)]] ({{circa|1652}}–1720), [[Andreas Musalus]] ({{circa|1665}}–1721) and [[Vitsentzos Kornaros]].<ref>{{Cite book|author1=Tiepolo, Maria Francesca |author2=Tonetti, Eurigio |title=I greci a Venezia| publisher=Istituto veneto di scienze|year=2002|page=201|isbn=978-88-88143-07-1 |quote= Cretese Nikolaos Kalliakis}}</ref><ref name=" Boehm, Eric H. 1995 755 ">{{cite book | author= Boehm, Eric H. |title= Historical abstracts: Modern history abstracts, 1450–1914, Volume 46, Issues 3–4 |publisher= American Bibliographical Center of ABC-Clio |year= 1995 |page=755 |oclc= 701679973 |quote= Between the 15th and 19th centuries the University of Padua attracted a great number of Greek students who wanted to study medicine.

According to Starr's 1942 article, the rule of Giacomo Foscarini was a Dark Age for Jews and Greeks. Under his rule, non-Catholics had to pay high taxes with no allowances. In 1627, there were 800 Jews in the city of Candia, about seven percent of the city's population.<ref>Starr, J.

Many Greek Cretans fled to other regions of the [[Republic of Venice]] after the [[Ottoman–Venetian Wars]], some even prospering such as the family of [[Simone Stratigo]] (c. 1733 – c. 1824) who migrated to [[Dalmatia]] from Crete in 1669.<ref name=" Carlo Capra, Franco Della Peruta, Fernando Mazzocca 2002 pp.200">{{cite book |author1=Carlo Capra |author2=Franco Della Peruta |author3=Fernando Mazzocca |title= Napoleone e la repubblica italiana: 1802–1805 |publisher= Skira |year= 2002 |page=200 |isbn=978-88-8491-415-6 |quote= Simone Stratico, nato a Zara nel 1733 da famiglia originaria di Creta (abbandonata a seguito della conquista turca del 1669)}}</ref>

[[Islamic]] presence on the island, aside from the interlude of the [[Emirate of Crete|Arab occupation]], was cemented by the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman conquest]]. Most [[Cretan Muslims]] were local Greek converts who spoke Cretan [[Greek language|Greek]], but in the island's 19th-century political context they came to be viewed by the Christian population as Turks.<ref>Demetres Tziovas, ''Greece and the Balkans: Identities, Perceptions and Cultural Encounters Since the Enlightenment''; William Yale, ''The Near East: A modern history'' Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press, 1958)</ref> Contemporary estimates vary, but on the eve of the [[Greek War of Independence]] (1830), as much as 45% of the population of the island may have been Muslim.<ref>William Yale, ''The Near East: A modern history'' by (Ann Arbor, The University of Michigan Press, 1958)</ref> A number of [[Sufi]] orders were widespread throughout the island, the [[Bektashi]] order being the most prevalent, possessing at least five [[tekkes]]. Many [[Cretan Turks]] fled Crete because of the unrest, settling in Turkey, Rhodes, Syria, Libya and elsewhere. By 1900, 11% of the population was Muslim. Those remaining were relocated in the 1924 [[population exchange between Greece and Turkey]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.holidaytrust.nl/s/griekenland/kreta/|title=Vakantie Kreta – De beste Tips & Reviews {{!}} Holidaytrust.nl|language=nl|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref>

During Easter of 1770, a revolt against Ottoman rule in Crete was started by [[Daskalogiannis]], a shipowner from [[Sfakia]] who was promised support by [[Orlov Revolt|Orlov's fleet]] which never arrived. Daskalogiannis eventually surrendered to the Ottoman authorities. Today, the airport at Chania is named after him.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

During the [[Greek war of independence]], Sultan [[Mahmud II]] granted rule over Crete to Egypt's ruler [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]] in exchange for his military support. Crete was subsequently left out of the new Greek state established under the [[London Protocol of 1830]]. Its administration by Muhammad Ali was confirmed in the [[Convention of Kütahya]] of 1833, but direct Ottoman rule was re-established by the [[Convention of London (1840)|Convention of London]] of 3 July 1840.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

Heraklion was surrounded by high walls and bastions and extended westward and southward by the 17th century. The most opulent area of the city was the northeastern quadrant where the elite were gathered. The city had received another name under the rule of the Ottomans, "the deserted city".<ref name="Greene"/> The urban policy that the Ottoman applied to Candia was a two-pronged approach.<ref name="Greene"/> The first was the religious endowments. It made the Ottoman elite contribute to building and rehabilitating the ruined city. The other method was to boost the population and the urban revenue by selling off urban properties. According to Molly Greene (2001) there were numerous records of [[real-estate]] transactions during the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. In the deserted city, minorities received equal rights in purchasing property. Christians and Jews were also able to buy and sell in the real-estate market.

The [[Cretan Revolt (1866–69)|Cretan Revolt of 1866–1869]] or Great Cretan Revolution ({{langx|el|links=no|Κρητική Επανάσταση του 1866}}) was a three-year uprising against Ottoman rule, the third and largest in a series of revolts between the end of the Greek War of Independence in 1830 and the establishment of the independent Cretan State in 1898. A particular event which caused strong reactions among the liberal circles of western Europe was the ''Holocaust of Arkadi''. The event occurred in November 1866, as a large Ottoman force besieged the [[Arkadi Monastery]], which served as the headquarters of the rebellion. In addition to its 259 defenders, over 700 women and children had taken refuge in the monastery. After a few days of hard fighting, the Ottomans broke into the monastery. At that point, the abbot of the monastery set fire to the gunpowder stored in the monastery's vaults, causing the death of most of the rebels and the women and children sheltered there.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

===Cretan State 1898–1908===

Following the repeated uprisings in 1841, 1858, 1889, 1895 and 1897 by the Cretan people, who wanted to join Greece, the [[Great powers#History|Great Powers]] decided to restore order and in February 1897 sent in troops. The island was subsequently garrisoned by troops from Great Britain, France, Italy and Russia; Germany and Austro-Hungary withdrawing from the occupation in early 1898. During this period Crete was governed through a committee of admirals from the remaining four Powers. In March 1898 the Powers decreed, with the reluctant consent of the Sultan, that the island would be granted autonomy under Ottoman [[suzerainty]] in the near future.<ref>Pinar Senisik, ''The Transformation of Ottoman Crete, Revolts, Politics and Identity in the Late Nineteenth century'' p. 165. I. B. Tauris, 2011.</ref>

In September 1898 the [[Candia massacre]] in Candia, modern Heraklion, left over 500 Cretan Christians and 14 British servicemen dead at the hands of Muslim irregulars. As a result, the Admirals ordered the expulsion of all Ottoman troops and administrators from the island, a move that was ultimately completed by early November. The decision to grant autonomy to the island was enforced and a High Commissioner, [[Prince George of Greece]], appointed, arriving to take up his post in December 1898.<ref name=Holland>Robert Holland and Diane Markides, ''The British and the Hellenes: Struggles for Mastery in the Eastern Mediterranean 1850–1960''. p. 81. Oxford University Press, 2005.</ref> The flag of the [[Cretan State]] was chosen by the Powers, with the white star representing the Ottoman suzerainty over the island.

[[File:Flag of Cretan State.svg|thumb|250px|Flag of Cretan State]]

In 1905, disagreements between Prince George and minister Eleftherios Venizelos over the question of the ''[[enosis]]'' (union with Greece), such as the Prince's autocratic style of government, resulted in the [[Theriso revolt]], one of the leaders being [[Eleftherios Venizelos]].

Prince George resigned as High Commissioner and was replaced by [[Alexandros Zaimis]], a former Greek prime minister, in 1906. In 1908, taking advantage of domestic turmoil in Turkey as well as the timing of Zaimis's vacation away from the island, the Cretan deputies unilaterally declared union with Greece.

With the outbreak of the [[First Balkan War]], the Greek government declared that Crete was now Greek territory. This was not recognised internationally until 1 December 1913.<ref name=Holland/>

{{Main|Battle of Crete|Cretan resistance}}

During World War II, the island was the scene of the [[Battle of Crete]] in May 1941. The initial 11-day battle was bloody and left more than 11,000 soldiers and civilians killed or wounded. As a result of the fierce resistance from both Allied forces and civilian Cretan locals, the invasion force suffered heavy casualties, and [[Adolf Hitler]] forbade further large-scale [[paratroop]] operations for the rest of the war.

During the initial and subsequent occupation, German firing squads routinely executed male civilians in reprisal for the death of German soldiers; civilians were rounded up randomly in local villages for the mass killings, such as at the [[Massacre of Kondomari]] and the [[Viannos massacres]]. Two German generals were later tried and executed for their roles in the killing of 3,000 of the island's inhabitants.<ref>[http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/warcrimgenrls.htm "Some Noteworthy War Criminals"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401143013/http://www.ess.uwe.ac.uk/WCC/warcrimgenrls.htm |date=1 April 2012 }}, Source: ''History of the United Nations War Crimes Commission and the Development of the Laws of War'', United Nations War Crimes Commission.

Following the collapse of fronts elsewhere in Europe, German forces evacuated most of Crete in October 1944 leaving an area including Chania under occupation. The following year the day after [[VE Day]] the remaining Germans under Generalmajor [[Hans-Georg Benthack]] surrendered at [[Knossos]] to British Major-General [[Colin Callander]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Crete: The Battle and the Resistance |first=Antony |last=Beevor |authorlink=Antony Beevor |page=176 |publisher=John Murray |year=2005 |isbn=978-0-7195-6831-2}}</ref>

===Civil War===
In the aftermath of the [[Dekemvriana]] in Athens, Cretan leftists were targeted by the right-wing paramilitary organization National Organization of Rethymno (EOR), which engaged in attacks in the villages of Koxare and Melampes, as well as Rethymno in January 1945. Those attacks did not escalate into a full-scale insurgency as they did in the Greek mainland and the Cretan [[ELAS]] did not surrender its weapons after the [[Treaty of Varkiza]]. An uneasy truce was maintained until 1947, with a series of arrests of notable communists in Chania and Heraklion. Encouraged by orders from the central organization in Athens, KKE launched an insurgency in Crete; marking the beginning of the [[Greek Civil War]] on the island. In eastern Crete the [[Democratic Army of Greece]] (DSE) struggled to establish its presence in [[Dikti]] and [[Psilorites]]. On 1 July 1947, the surviving 55 fighters of DSE were ambushed south of Psilorites, the few surviving members of the unit managed to join the rest of DSE in [[Lefka Ori]].{{sfn|Margaritis|2006|pp=441–447}}

The [[Lefka Ori]] region in the west offered more favourable conditions for DSE's insurgency. In the summer of 1947 DSE raided and looted the [[Maleme Airport]] and motor depot at Chrysopigi. Its numbers swelled to approximately 300 fighters. The rise of DSE numbers compounded with crop failure on the island created serious logistical issues for the insurgents. The communists resorted to [[Cattle raiding|cattle rustling]] and crop confiscations which solved the problem only temporarily. In the autumn of 1947, the Greek government offered generous amnesty terms to Cretan DSE fighters and mountain bandits, many of whom opted to abandon armed struggle or defect to the nationalists. On 4 July 1948, government troops launched a large scale offensive on [[Samariá Gorge]]. Many DSE soldiers were killed in the fighting while the survivors broke into small armed bands. In October 1948, the secretary of the Cretan KKE Giorgos Tsitilos was killed in an ambush. By the following month only 34 DSE fighters remained active in Lefka Ori. The insurgency in Crete gradually withered away, with the last two hold outs surrendering in 1974, 25 years after the conclusion of the war in mainland Greece.{{sfn|Margaritis|2006|pp=447–452}}

[[File:Web aquilahotels.jpg|thumb|250px|Resort in [[Rethymno]]]]
Crete is one of the most popular holiday destinations in Greece. 15% of all arrivals in Greece come through the city of Heraklion (port and airport), while charter journeys to Heraklion make up about [https://greece4u.com.gr/destination/crete/ 20% of all charter flights in Greece] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729001912/https://greece4u.com.gr/destination/crete/ |date=29 July 2020 }}. The number of hotel beds on the island increased by 53% in the period between 1986 and 1991.

Today, the island's tourism infrastructure includes a wide range of accommodation; including large luxury hotels with their complete facilities, swimming pools, sports and recreation, smaller family-owned apartments, camping facilities and others. Visitors reach the island via two international airports in Heraklion and [[Chania]] and a smaller airport in [[Sitia]] (international charter and domestic flights started in May 2012)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sitia.gr/information-services/news/aerchart.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001191455/http://www.sitia.gr/information-services/news/aerchart.html|url-status=dead|title=14/06/2011.

===Archaeological sites and museums===

{{Main|List of museums in Greece#Crete}}

The area has a large number of archaeological sites, including the Minoan sites of [[Knossos]], [[Malia (archaeological site)|Malia]] (not to be confused with the town of the same name), Zakros, [[Petras]] and [[Phaistos]], the classical site of [[Gortys]], and the diverse archaeology of the island of [[Koufonisi]], which includes Minoan, Roman, and World War II era ruins (nb. due to conservation concerns, access to Koufonisi has been restricted for the last few years).

There are museums throughout Crete. The [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum]] displays most of the archaeological finds from the Minoan era and was reopened in 2014.<ref>[http://www.explorecrete.com/archaeology/antiquities-crete.html Archaeological sites and Museums in Crete] ExploreCrete.com</ref>

=== Harmful effects ===
Helen Briassoulis, in a qualitative analysis, proposed in the ''[[Journal of Sustainable Tourism]]'' that Crete is affected by tourism applying pressure to it to develop at an unhealthy rate, and that informal, internal systems within the country are forced to adapt. According to her, these forces have strengthened in three stages: from the period from 1960 to 1970, 1970–1990, and 1990 to the present. During this first period, tourism was a largely positive force, pushing modern developments like running water and electricity onto the largely rural countryside. However, beginning in the second period and especially in the third period leading up to the present day, tourist companies became more pushy with deforestation and pollution of Crete's natural resources. The country is then pulled into an interesting parity, where these companies only upkeep those natural resources that are directly essential to their industry.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Briassoulis|first=Helen|date=1 September 2003|title=Crete: Endowed by Nature, Privileged by Geography, Threatened by Tourism?|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/09669580308667198|journal=Journal of Sustainable Tourism|volume=11|issue=2–3|pages=97–115|doi=10.1080/09669580308667198|bibcode=2003JSusT..11...97B |s2cid=28002287|issn=0966-9582}}</ref>

== Fauna and flora ==
{{main|Crete Mediterranean forests}}

===Fauna===

Crete is isolated from mainland Europe, Asia, and Africa, and this is reflected in the diversity of the fauna and flora. As a result, the fauna and flora of Crete have many clues to the evolution of species. There are no animals that are dangerous to humans on the island of Crete in contrast to other parts of Greece. Indeed, the ancient Greeks attributed the lack of large mammals such as bears, wolves, jackals, and venomous snakes, to the labour of [[Hercules]] (who took a live Cretan bull to the [[Peloponnese]]). Hercules wanted to honor the birthplace of Zeus by removing all "harmful" and "venomous" animals from Crete. Later, Cretans believed that the island was cleared of dangerous creatures by the [[Apostle Paul]], who lived on the island of Crete for two years, with his exorcisms and blessings. 

The [[Natural History Museum of Crete]], operates under the direction of the [[University of Crete]] and two aquariums – [[Aquaworld Aquarium|Aquaworld]] in [[Hersonissos]] and [[Cretaquarium]] in Gournes, display sea creatures common in Cretan waters.

==Mythology==
{{Main|Greek mythology}}
[[File:Zeushoehle.jpg|thumb|250px|upright=0.9|[[Psychro Cave|Diktaean Cave]]]]

Crete has a strong association with ancient [[Greek gods]] but is also connected with the [[Minoan civilization]].

According to [[Greek mythology]], the [[Psychro Cave|Diktaean Cave]] at Mount [[Dikti]] was the birthplace of the god [[Zeus]]. The [[Paximadia]] islands were the birthplace of the goddess [[Artemis]] and the god [[Apollo]]. Their mother, the goddess [[Leto]], was worshipped at [[Phaistos]]. The goddess [[Athena]] bathed in Lake Voulismeni. Zeus launched a lightning bolt at a giant lizard that was threatening Crete. The lizard immediately turned to stone and became the lizard-shaped island of [[Dia (island)|Dia]], which can be seen from Knossos. The islets of [[Souda (island)|Lefkai]] were the result of a musical contest between the [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]s and the [[Muses]]. The Muses were so anguished to have lost that they plucked the feathers from the wings of their rivals; the Sirens turned white and fell into the sea at [[Aptera, Greece|Aptera]] ("featherless"), where they formed the islands in the bay that were called Lefkai (the islands of [[Souda (island)|Souda]] and [[Leon (Souda Bay)|Leon]]).<ref>Caroline M. Galt, "A marble fragment at Mount Holyoke College from the Cretan city of Aptera", ''Art and Archaeology'' '''6''' (1920:150).</ref> [[Heracles]], in one of his labors, took the [[Cretan bull]] to the Peloponnese. [[Europa (consort of Zeus)|Europa]] and Zeus made love at [[Gortys]] and conceived the kings of Crete: [[Rhadamanthys]], [[Sarpedon (brother of Minos)|Sarpedon]], and Minos.

The [[labyrinth]] of the [[Palace of Knossos]] was the setting for the myth of [[Theseus#Minotaur|Theseus and the Minotaur]] in which the Minotaur was slain by Theseus. [[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]] were captives of King Minos and crafted wings to escape. After his death, King Minos became a judge of the dead in [[Hades]], while [[Rhadamanthys]] became the ruler of the [[Elysium|Elysian fields]].

Crete has its own distinctive [[Mantinada|Mantinades]] poetry. The island is known for its Mantinades-based [[Music of Crete|music]] (typically performed with the [[Lyra (Cretan)|Cretan lyra]] and the [[laouto]]) and has many indigenous dances, the most noted of which is the [[Pentozali]]. Since the 1980s and certainly in the 1990s onwards there has been a proliferation of Cultural Associations that teach dancing (in Western Crete where many focus on rizitiko singing). These Associations often perform in official events but also become stages for people to meet and engage in traditionalist practices. The topic of tradition and the role of Cultural Associations in reviving it is often debated throughout Crete.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kalantzis |first1=Konstantinos |title=Tradition in the Frame Photography, Power, and Imagination in Sfakia, Crete |date=2019 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-03713-8 |pages=153–178}}</ref>

Cretan authors have made important contributions to [[Greek literature]] throughout the modern period; major names include [[Vikentios Kornaros]], creator of the 17th-century epic romance ''[[Erotokritos]]'' (Greek Ερωτόκριτος), and, in the 20th century, [[Nikos Kazantzakis]]. In the Renaissance, Crete was the home of the [[Cretan School]] of icon painting, which influenced [[El Greco]] and through him subsequent European painting.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Island's Culture |url=https://activecrete.gr/islands-culture/ |access-date=2024-04-15 |website=Active Crete |language=en-US}}</ref>

Cretans are proud of their island and customs, and men often don elements of traditional dress in everyday life: knee-high black riding boots (''stivania''), [[Breeches#Types of breeches|''vráka'' breeches]] tucked into the boots at the knee, black shirt and black headdress consisting of a fishnet-weave kerchief worn wrapped around the head or draped on the shoulders (''mantili'' / ''kefalomantilo''). Men often grow large mustaches as a mark of pride, manhood and valiance.

Cretan society is known in Greece and internationally for family and clan [[feud|vendettas]] which persist on the island to date.<ref name="feud">Brian Murphy: [http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990114&slug=2938763 Vendetta Victims: People, A Village – Crete's 'Cycle Of Blood' Survives The Centuries] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121003210956/http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19990114&slug=2938763 |date=3 October 2012 }} at ''[[The Seattle Times]]'', 14 January 1999.</ref><ref>Aris Tsantiropoulos: {{cite web |url= http://www.pbs.plymouth.ac.uk/solon/journal/issue%202.1/Tsantiropoulos_Article_final%5B1%5D%5B1%5D.pdf |title= Collective Memory and Blood Feud: The Case of Mountainous Crete |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120331102316/http://www.pbs.plymouth.ac.uk/solon/journal/issue%202.1/Tsantiropoulos_Article_final%5B1%5D%5B1%5D.pdf |archive-date= 31 March 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&nbsp;{{small|(254&nbsp;KB)}}, ''Crimes and Misdemeanours'' 2/1 (2008), [[University of Crete]].</ref> Cretans also have a tradition of keeping firearms at home, stemming from the era of resistance against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Nearly every rural household on Crete has at least one unregistered gun.<ref name="feud"/> Guns are subject to strict regulation from the Greek government, and in recent years an effort to control firearms in Crete has been undertaken by the Greek police, but with limited success.
