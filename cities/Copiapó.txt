'''Copiapó''' ({{IPA|es|kopjaˈpo}}) is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[communes of Chile|commune]] in northern [[Chile]], located about 65 kilometers east of the coastal [[List of towns in Chile|town]] of [[Caldera, Chile|Caldera]]. Founded on December 8, 1744, it is the capital of [[Copiapó Province]] and [[Atacama Region]].

Copiapó lies about 800&nbsp;km north of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]] by the [[Copiapó River]], in the valley of the same name. In the early 21st century, the river has dried up in response to climate change and more severe droughts. The town is surrounded by the [[Atacama Desert]] and receives 12&nbsp;mm (½ in) of rain per year. The population of Copiapó was 9,128 in 1903; and 11,617 in 1907. As of 2012, there are 158,438 inhabitants.

Copiapó is in a rich silver and copper mining district. A bronze statue commemorates [[Juan Godoy]], discoverer of the [[Chañarcillo]] silver mines in the 19th century. The Copiapó-Caldera [[railway]] line, built in 1850, was the first one in South America. The first section between [[Caldera, Chile|Caldera]] and Monte Amargo was inaugurated on July 4, 1850 in honor of the [[United States Independence Day|Independence Day]], as American businessman [[William Wheelwright]] was responsible for the project.  The original wooden [[railway station]] is now a National Monument.

==History==
{{See also|Chilean silver rush}}

Spanish explorers founded the settlement in 1742<ref name="EB1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Copiapó|volume=7|page=101}}</ref> and named it ''San Francisco de la Selva de Copiapó'' or Saint Francis of the Jungle of Copiapó, due to its lush vegetation. Prior to [[Spain|Spanish]] occupation, the area was inhabited by the [[Diaguita]] people under the rule of the [[Inca Empire]] into the 16th century. Remains of Diaguita fortresses have been found in this area. The earliest archaeological remains of human activity in the [[Copiapó Valley]] are thought to be around 10,000 years old. The settlement developed around the remains of an [[Inca]] cemetery.

After the discovery of the rich silver deposits near [[Chañarcillo]] by [[Juan Godoy]] in 1832 it became an important mining centre,<ref name="EB1911"/> and until Chile annexed [[Antofagasta]] from Bolivia and [[Iquique]] and [[Arica]] from Peru following the [[War of the Pacific]] (1879–1883), Copiapó was the nation's northernmost city and main mining city.
[[File:1879-12-31, La Ilustración Española y Americana, Panorama de Copiapó, capital de la provincia de Atacama.jpg|thumb|left|Panorama of Copiapó published in 1879 in ''[[La Ilustración Española y Americana]]'']]
An earthquake on 4 December 1918 caused extensive damage throughout the city.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/hazel/view/hazards/earthquake/event-more-info/3129|title=Significant Earthquake Information| last=National Geophysical Data Center / World Data Service (NGDC/WDS): NCEI/WDS Global Significant Earthquake Database. NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information.| doi=10.7289/V5TD9V7K| access-date=March 19, 2024}}</ref>

Through the 20th century, the city of Copiapó grew markedly, both from the mining industry and its role as capital of its department.

On 5 August 2010, [[2010 Copiapó mining accident|the San José Copper Mine]] collapsed, trapping 33 miners underground. The mine was about {{convert|45|km|sp=us}} north of the city. The miners were {{convert|700|m|ft|sp=us}} deep and {{convert|5|km|0|sp=us}} from the mine's entrance via spiraling underground ramps.<ref name="mineros2">

The miners survived underground for 69 days until all were brought to the surface on 13 October 2010, a record period of time. This mine has been closed, but the industry of copper and gold mining is very important in the region.

==Demographics==

Temperatures rarely fall below freezing. Most of the precipitation falls during this time of the year with June and July being the wettest months.<ref name="DMC" /> While winters are normally dry, precipitation is highly variable. This was the case when June 1998{{Contradict-inline|reason=Article states record precipitation and no precipitation occurred in 1998|date=September 2017}} recorded {{convert|68|mm|in|0}} of precipitation but generally, in most years, precipitation is rare.<ref name="DMC" /> Summers are warm with a January average of {{convert|22.2|C|1}} and precipitation is virtually non-existent.<ref name="DMC" /> Temperatures can occasionally exceed {{convert|30|C|1}} any time of the year.

==Economy==
Copiapó has a diversified and potential economy, but [[mining]] is the largest economic activity.<ref>[http://www.economiaatacama.cl/regionatacama.html  Secretaría Regional Ministerial de Economia Región de Atacama ::<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070718094318/http://www.economiaatacama.cl/regionatacama.html |date=2007-07-18 }}</ref> The Copiapó Basin has a great deal of copper ore, mined by companies such as Minera Candelaria, which extracts copper near [[Tierra Amarilla, Chile|Tierra Amarilla]], a neighboring commune. This generates a need for transportation, light industry, and services. "Small mining" represents over 30% of the production. The copper obtained by ''pirquineros'' (miners) goes to the copper smelter at [[Paipote]].

[[Agriculture]] is the second-largest source of income in this area. It consists largely of grape production, with olives, tomatoes, avocados and some citrus fruits also produced as commodity crops.

[[Industrial sector|Industry]]: Copiapó has mainly light industry, and some medium industry such as the INACESA plant and Paipote copper refinery.

[[Energy]]: Many important solar plants were built in the Atacama Region, benefiting from the high amount of and constant solar radiation during the year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://walker.dgf.uchile.cl/Explorador/Solar3/|title=Explorador Solar}}</ref> Solar photovoltaic energy production in 2016 reached more than 400 MW connected to the Central-North grid.

[[Commerce]] is growing in Copiapó, largely old and new, small and medium enterprises. Downtown Copiapó activity reflects the growth of the city. Some local enterprises have grown rapidly in the last decade, such as the Albasini and Don Álvaro chain-stores. The national government's free-market policies, along with a higher demand and better economic expectations, have encouraged the establishment here of such national businesses as the supermarkets Deca (1999), Jumbo (2005), and Lider (2006).

[[Tourism]] in Copiapó has been developing since the early 21st century. Some come to see the desert and indigenous monuments, such as the [[Inca]] cemetery in the city, which was investigated in the 1930s. In addition, a new casino has attracted both domestic and foreign tourists, and hotels have invested in new amenities and structures to satisfy demand.

==== Recent municipal politics ====
Since the [[Chilean transition to democracy|return to democracy]] in 1990, there have been six mayoral elections held in Copiapó.
 
In 1992,<ref>[http://www.elecciones.gob.cl/SitioHistorico/index1992_muni.htm Sistema De Despliegue De Computos – Ministerio Del Interior<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813013832/http://www.elecciones.gob.cl/SitioHistorico/index1992_muni.htm |date=2007-08-13 }}</ref> [[Mónica Calcutta Stormenzan|Mónica Calcutta]] (PPD) won the election against 24 candidates. Her term was characterized by public expenditures on green areas, parks, and street paving, and public infrastructure such as the new building of the City Hall (1994), the Estadio Techado (1996), and the Technological School (inaugurated in 1997). During her term, Calcutta encouraged people to participate. One of these activities was the "Train of History" carried out in 1994 (for the 250th anniversary of Copiapó) and 1995.

Despite all these expenditures, the City Hall ended up with no debt for 1996.

In 1996,<ref>[http://www.elecciones.gob.cl/SitioHistorico/index1996_muni.htm Sistema De Despliegue De Computos – Ministerio Del Interior<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813013850/http://www.elecciones.gob.cl/SitioHistorico/index1996_muni.htm |date=2007-08-13 }}</ref> Calcutta ran for the re-election, but was defeated by the socialist candidate [[Marcos López Rivera|Marcos López]] (city councilor 1992&ndash;1996) by a narrow margin of 146 votes. López's term differed substantially from Calcutta's; his first three years as mayor did not see any important public expenditures in visible things. They came out the year before the following election.

The 2000 election was a very confrontational one. López and Calcutta ran for election together with 10 other candidates.

This is the event that gathers the most 4x4 automobiles in the world, and it began in 1992.

The effort and spirit of Raid Atacama has made it worthy of the National Award for Tourism. For over 21 years, the Atacama Raid has been the cornerstone of the development of off-road activities along [[Chile]], and its example has been followed by many clubs and even several companies.

In the last seven years, the enrollment has kept steady on an average of about 500 vehicles per event, and more than 1,800 participants from all regions of the country and abroad.
