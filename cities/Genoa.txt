== Name ==
The city's modern name may derive from the [[Latin]] word meaning "knee" (''genu''; plural, ''genua'') but there are other theories. It could derive from the god [[Janus]], because Genoa, like him, has two faces: a face that looks at the sea and another turned to the mountains. Or it could come from the Latin word ''ianua'', also related to the name of the God Janus, and meaning "door", or "passage." Besides that, it may refer to its geographical position at the centre of the Ligurian coastal arch. The Latin name, ''oppidum Genua'', is recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] (''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Nat. Hist.]]'' 3.48) as part of the [[Augustus|Augustean]] ''[[Regio IX Liguria]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Petracco Sicardi|first=Giulia|title=Toponomastica storica della Liguria|publisher=SAGEP|language=it}}</ref>

Another theory traces the name to the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] word ''Kainua'' which means "New City", based on an inscription on a pottery sherd reading ''Kainua'', which suggests that the Latin name may be a corruption of an older Etruscan one with an original meaning of "new town".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Melli|first=Piera|title=Genova preromana.

===Prehistory and Roman times===

The city's area has been inhabited since the fifth or fourth millennium BC, making it one of the [[oldest continuously inhabited cities]] in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Archeologia Metropolitana Museo di Archeologia Ligure Genova|url=http://1995-2015.undo.net/it/mostra/98539|access-date=2020-12-11|website=1995-2015.undo.net|language=it}}</ref> In the fifth century BC the first town, or [[oppidum]], was founded probably by the [[Ligures|ancient Ligures]] (which gave the name to the modern region of [[Liguria]]) at the top of the hill today called Castello (Castle), which is now inside the medieval old town.<ref>The objects found during the works for the underground had been exposed in the exhibition ''Archeologia Metropolitana. Piazza Brignole e Acquasola'', held at the Ligurian Archeology Museum (30 November 2009 – 14 February 2010) ([http://www.museidigenova.it/spip.php?article479] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235040/http://www.museidigenova.it/spip.php?article479|date=30 December 2013|data=30 dicembre 2013}})</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Melli|first=Piera|title=Genova preromana. Città portuale del Mediterraneo tra il VII e il III secolo a.C.|publisher=Frilli|language=it}}</ref> In this period the Genoese town, inhabited by the "Genuati" (a group of Ligure peoples), was considered "the emporium of the Ligurians", given its strong commercial character.<ref>{{Cite web|title=I Liguri – L'Oltre Po|url=http://www.robertomarchese.it/i--liguri.html|access-date=2022-01-30|website=www.robertomarchese.it}}</ref>

The "Genoese oppidum" had an alliance with [[Roman Republic|Rome]] through a ''foedus aequum'' (equal pact) in the course of the [[Second Punic War]]. The [[Carthaginians]] accordingly destroyed it in 209&nbsp;BC. The town was rebuilt and, after the [[Carthaginian Wars]] ended in 146&nbsp;BC, it received municipal rights. The original ''castrum'' then expanded towards the current areas of Santa Maria di Castello and the San Lorenzo promontory. Trade goods included skins, timber, and honey. Goods were moved to and from Genoa's hinterland, including major cities like [[Tortona]] and [[Piacenza]]. An amphitheater was also found there among other archaeological remains from the Roman period.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Alla scoperta di Genova: Genova romana|url=http://danielea.altervista.org/alla_scoperta_di_Genova/genovaromana.html|access-date=2021-12-27|website=danielea.altervista.org}}</ref>

===Middle Ages to early modern period===

===5th to 10th centuries===

After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Ostrogoths]] occupied Genoa. After the [[Gothic War (535–554)|Gothic War]], the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] made it the seat of their [[vicar]]. When the [[Lombards]] invaded Italy in 568, Bishop [[Honoratus of Mediolanum|Honoratus]] of [[Bishopric of Milan|Milan]] fled and held his seat in Genoa.<ref>Paul the Deacon, Historia Langobardorum, II.25</ref> During this time and in the following century Genoa was little more than a small centre, slowly building its merchant fleet, which was to become the leading commercial carrier of the Western Mediterranean. In 934–35 the town was [[Fatimid sack of Genoa|thoroughly sacked and burned]] by a [[Fatimid fleet]] under [[Ya'qub ibn Ishaq al-Tamimi]].<ref>{{Cite book|author=Steven A.

Genoa started expanding during the [[First Crusade]]. At the time the city had a population of about 10,000. Twelve [[galley]]s, one ship and 1,200 soldiers from Genoa joined the crusade. The Genoese troops, led by noblemen de Insula and Avvocato, set sail in July 1097.<ref name="genfir">{{cite book|author=Steven A.

The Republic's role as a maritime power in the Mediterranean region secured many favorable commercial treaties for Genoese merchants.

===13th and 14th centuries===

The commercial and cultural rivalry of Genoa and Venice was played out through the thirteenth century. Thanks to the major role played by the [[Republic of Venice]] in the [[Fourth Crusade]], Venetian trading rights were enforced in the eastern Mediterranean and Venice was able to gain control of a large portion of maritime commerce in the region.<ref name="vas"/>

To regain control of local commerce, the Republic of Genoa allied with [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]], emperor of [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], who wanted to restore the Byzantine Empire by recapturing [[Constantinople]]. In March 1261 the treaty of the alliance was signed in [[Kemalpaşa|Nymphaeum]].<ref name="vas"/> On 25 July 1261, Nicaean troops under [[Alexios Strategopoulos]] recaptured Constantinople.<ref name="vas"/> As a result, the balance of favour tipped toward Genoa, which was granted free trade rights in the Nicene Empire.<ref name="vas"/> The islands of [[Chios]] and [[Lesbos]] became commercial stations of Genoa as well as the city of [[Smyrna]] (Izmir). In the same century the Republic conquered many settlements in [[Crimea]], known as [[Gazaria (Genoese colonies)|Gazaria]], where the Genoese colony of [[Feodosiya|Caffa]] was established. The alliance with the restored Byzantine Empire increased the wealth and power of Genoa, and simultaneously decreased Venetian and Pisan commerce. The Byzantine Empire had granted the majority of free trading rights to Genoa.<ref name="navwa">{{cite book|author=William Ledyard Rodgers |title=Naval warfare under oars, 4th to 16th centuries: a study of strategy, tactics and ship design |year=1967 |pages=132–34 |publisher=Naval Institute Press |isbn=0-87021-487-X}}</ref>

Around the 14th century, Genoa was also credited with the invention of blue [[jeans]]. Genoa's jean fabric was a [[fustian]] textile of "medium quality and of reasonable cost", very similar to cotton [[corduroy]] for which Genoa was famous, and was "used for work clothes in general". The [[Genoese navy]] equipped its sailors with jeans, as they needed a fabric which could be worn wet or dry.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qy4YtuIHsQcC&pg=PA235|title=Transnationalism and Society: An Introduction|last=Howard|first=Michael C.|year=2011|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786486250|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/jeans.htm|title=Jeans|website=facweb.cs.depaul.edu|access-date=14 August 2017|archive-date=19 June 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170619115433/http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/sgrais/jeans.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the [[Aragonese–Genoese War]], [[Siege of Genoa (1331)|Genoa was besieged]] and sacked by Guillem de Cervelló. As a result of the Genoese support to the [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragonese]] rule in [[Kingdom of Sicily|Sicily]], Genoa was granted free trading and export rights in the Kingdom. Genoese bankers also profited from loans to the new nobility of Sicily. Corsica was formally annexed in 1347.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica, 1910, Volume 7, page 201.</ref>

In the 15th century two of the earliest banks in the world were founded in Genoa: the [[Bank of Saint George]], founded in 1407, which was the oldest state deposit bank in the world at its closure in 1805 and the [[Mount of piety|Monte di Pietà]] of Genoa founded in 1483. [[Christopher Columbus]] was born in Genoa {{circa}}&nbsp;1451, and donated one-tenth of his income from the discovery of the Americas for Spain to the [[Bank of Saint George]] in Genoa for the relief of taxation on foods. Under the ensuing economic recovery, many aristocratic Genoese families, such as the Balbi, [[Doria (family)|Doria]], [[Grimaldi Family|Grimaldi]], [[Pallavicini family|Pallavicini]], and Serra, amassed tremendous fortunes. According to Felipe Fernandez-Armesto and others, the practices Genoa developed in the [[Mediterranean]] (such as chattel slavery) were crucial in the exploration and exploitation of the New World.<ref>''Before Columbus: Exploration and Colonization from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, 1229–1492''.</ref>

Thereafter, Genoa underwent something of an associate of the [[Spanish Empire]], with Genoese bankers, in particular, financing many of the Spanish crown's foreign endeavors from their [[counting house]]s in [[Seville]]. [[Fernand Braudel]] has even called the period 1557 to 1627 the "age of the Genoese", "of a rule that was so discreet and sophisticated that historians for a long time failed to notice it" (Braudel 1984 p.&nbsp;157). The Genoese bankers provided the unwieldy [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg]] system with fluid credit and a dependably regular income. In return the less dependable shipments of American silver were rapidly transferred from Seville to Genoa, to provide capital for further ventures. Genoa's trade, however, remained closely dependent on control of Mediterranean sealanes, and the loss of [[Chios]] to the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1566), struck a severe blow.<ref>Philip P.

From the 17th century, the Genoese Republic started a period of slow decline, In May 1625 a French-Savoian army briefly laid siege to Genoa. Though it was eventually [[Relief of Genoa|lifted with the aid of the Spanish]], the French would later [[Bombardment of Genoa|bombard the city]] in May 1684 for its support of Spain during the [[War of the Reunions]].<ref>[http://www.zum.de/whkmla/military/17cen/genoa1684.html ''Genoa 1684''], World History at KMLA.</ref> In-between, a [[Naples Plague|plague]] killed as many as half of the inhabitants of Genoa in 1656–57.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/297474/Italy/27687/Early-modern-Italy-16th-to-18th-centuries Early modern Italy (16th to 18th centuries) » The 17th-century crisis] ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''</ref>

===18th century===

In 1729, the Republic of Genoa must cope with the beginning of the Corsica revolution for the independence, first led by [[Luiggi Giafferi]] and Giacinto Paoli, which culminated after 26 years of struggles, costly in economic and military terms for the Republic of Genoa, in a self proclaimed [[Corsican Republic]] in 1755 under the leadership of [[Pasquale Paoli]], son of Giacinto Paoli.

The Republic of Genoa continued its slow decline well into the 18th century, losing its last [[Mediterranean]] colony, the island fortress of [[Tabarka]], to the [[Bey of Tunis]] in 1742.<ref>Alberti Russell, Janice.

The [[Convention of Turin]] of 1742, in which Austria allied with the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], caused some consternation in the Republic.  Consequently, the Republic of Genoa signed a secret treaty with the Bourbon allies of [[Kingdom of France]], [[Spanish Empire]] and [[Kingdom of Naples]]. On 26 June 1745, the Republic of Genoa declared war on the Kingdom of Sardinia. This decision would prove disastrous for Genoa, which later surrendered to the Austrians in September 1746 and was briefly occupied before a revolt liberated the city two months later.<ref>{{Cite book|last=S. Browning|first=Reed|title=WAR OF THE AUSTRIAN SUCCESSION|publisher=Griffin|pages=205}}</ref>

The Republic of Genoa, in a weak state and not capable of suppressing the Corsican struggle for independence, was forced to cede [[Corsica]] to [[France]] in 1768 [[Treaty of Versailles (1768)|Treaty of Versailles]]. Only a year later, [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was born in Corsica.

In 1780, the Confetteria Romanengo was founded in Genoa.<ref>{{cite web |title=Pietro Romanengo Confectionery – a sweet tradition since 1780. |url=https://www.romanengo.com/en/home-page-en/ |website=romanengo.com |access-date=15 December 2022}}</ref>

====The fall of the Republic====
{{Main||French Revolutionary Wars}}
The direct intervention of [[Napoleon]] (during the [[Campaigns of 1796 in the French Revolutionary Wars|Campaigns of 1796]]) and his representatives in Genoa was the final act that led to the fall of the Republic in early June, who overthrew the old elites which had ruled the state for all of its history, giving birth to the [[Ligurian Republic]] on 14 June 1797, under the watchful care of Napoleonic France.

===19th century===
{{Main||First French Empire}}
After Bonaparte's seizure of power in France, a more conservative constitution was enacted, but the Ligurian Republic's life was short—in 1805 it was annexed by France, becoming the ''[[département in France|départements]]'' of [[Apennins]], [[Gênes]], and [[Montenotte (department)|Montenotte]].<ref name=":0" />

====The annexation to the Kingdom of Sardinia====

{{Main|Duchy of Genoa|Kingdom of Sardinia}}
Following the fall of Napoleon, Genoa regained ephemeral independence, with the name of the ''Repubblica genovese'', which lasted less than a year. However, the [[Congress of Vienna]] established the annexation of the whole territories of the former Genoese Republic to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]], governed by the [[House of Savoy]], contravening the principle of restoring the legitimate governments and monarchies of the old Republic.<ref>{{Cite web|last=LIGUSTICO|first=GIORNALE|title=LA CADUTA DELLA REPUBBLICA DI GENOVA|url=https://www.storiapatriagenova.it/Docs/Biblioteca_Digitale/SB/aaf535a76b222e2018bb2778067e0f7b/Estratti/793e783549715b425bb75ed667b38620.pdf}}</ref>

In 1917 [[Lloyd Italico]] insurance company was founded. From 1935 to 1940 [[Torre Piacentini]] was built in Genoa. It was one of the first skyscrapers built in Europe and, until 1954, the tallest habitable building in Italy. In 1956 Genoa took part in the [[Regatta of the Historical Marine Republics]]. In 1962 [[Genoa International Boat Show]] was established.

In 1987 the [[Banco di San Giorgio (1987–2012)|Banco di San Giorgio]] was established. In 1992 Genoa celebrated the Colombiadi<ref>{{cite web |title=colombiadi |url=https://dizionari.repubblica.it/Italiano/C/colombiadi.html |website=repubblica.it |access-date=28 November 2022}}</ref> or [[Genoa Expo '92]], the celebration of the 500th anniversary of the discovery of the [[American Continent]] by [[Christopher Columbus]]. The area of the ancient port of Genoa is restructured and expanded also with the works of the architect [[Renzo Piano]].

== Flag ==
[[File:St_George's_Cross.svg|thumb|right|320 px|The Cross of Saint George as a rectangular flag.]]
[[File:Palazzo Ducale Genova 02.jpg|thumbnail|upright|St. George's flag flying on the [[Doge's Palace, Genoa|Doge's Palace]] in Genoa]]
The '''flag of Genoa''' is a [[St. George's Cross]], a red cross on a white field.

The patron saint of Genoa was Saint [[Lawrence of Rome|Lawrence]] until at least 958, but the Genoese transferred their allegiance to [[Saint George]] (and Saint [[John the Baptist]]) at some point during the 11th or 12th century, most likely with the rising popularity of the [[military saint]] during the [[Crusades]]. Genoa also had a banner displaying a cross since at latest 1218, possibly as early as 1113.<ref>Perrin, ''British Flags'', 1922, 22–25.</ref> But the cross banner was not associated with the saint; indeed, the saint had his own flag, the ''vexillum beati Georgii'' (first mentioned 1198), a red flag showing George and the dragon. A depiction of this flag is shown in the Genoese annals under the year 1227. The Genoese flag with the red cross was used alongside this "Saint George's flag", from at least 1218, known as the ''insignia cruxata comunis Janue'' ("cross ensign of the commune of Genoa").

The saint's flag was the city's main war flag, but the cross flag was used alongside it in the 1240s.<ref>Aldo Ziggioto, "Genova", in ''Vexilla Italica'' 1, XX (1993); Aldo Ziggioto, "Le Bandiere degli Stati Italiani", in ''Armi Antiche'' 1994, cited after [http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/it-genoa.html Pier Paolo Lugli, 18 July 2000] on ''[[Flags of the World (website)|Flags of the World]]''.</ref>

The [[Saint George]]'s flag (i.e. the flag depicting the saint) remained the main flag of Genoa at least until the 1280s. The flag now known as the "St. George's Cross" seems to have replaced it as Genoa's main flag at some point during the 14th century. The ''[[Book of Knowledge of All Kingdoms]]'' (c. 1385) shows it, inscribed with the word ''iustiçia'', and described as:
{{blockquote|And the lord of this place has as his ensign a white pennant with a red cross. At the top it is inscribed with 'justice', in this manner.<ref>transcription after the edition by Joaquín Rubio Tovar (2005).</ref>}}

There was also a historiographical tradition claiming<ref>E.g.  "Richard Coeur de Lion embarked on Genoese galleys under their banner of the Red Cross and the flag of St. George, which he brought home to become the patron of Old England". ''The Journal of the Manchester Geographical Society'', Volumes 7–8, 1891, p. 139. There are variants; in another version Richard is impressed with the Genoese [[Siege of Acre (1189–91)|at Acre]].</ref> that the [[flag of England]] was derived from the Genoese flag, which derives from the [[Knights Templar]]'s red cross, during the [[Third Crusade]] in 1190; however, it cannot be substantiated as historical.<ref>
* "I have been unable to find any solid ground for the common belief that the cross of St George was introduced as the national emblem of England by Richard I, and am of opinion that it did not begin to attain that position until the first years of the reign of Edward I." (Perrin 1922, [https://archive.org/stream/britishflagsthei00perrrich#page/n15/mode/2up p. 15]).

==Geography==
The city of Genoa covers an area of {{convert|243|km2|sqmi}} between the [[Ligurian Sea]] and the [[Apennine Mountains]]. The city stretches along the coast for about {{convert|30|km|mi}} from the neighbourhood of [[Voltri]] to Nervi, and for {{convert|10|km|mi}} from the coast to the north along the valleys [[Val Polcevera|Polcevera]] and [[Bisagno (stream)|Bisagno]]. The territory of Genoa is popularly divided into 5 main zones: the centre, the west, the east, the [[Polcevera]] and the Bisagno Valley. Although much of the city centre is located at a low elevation, the territory surrounding it is mountainous with undeveloped land usually being in steep terrain.

Genoa is adjacent to two popular Ligurian vacation spots: [[Camogli]] and [[Portofino]]. In the metropolitan area of Genoa lies [[Aveto Natural Regional Park]].
{{wide image|Panorama di Genova.jpg|800px|A panoramic view of Genoa}}

===Climate===
Genoa has a [[Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'') in the [[Köppen climate classification]], with plentiful precipitation due to its location on a [[Genoa low|common storm track]]. Due to its position between the sea and mountains over 1000 meters high, each neighborhood of Genoa has specific climatic characteristics.

The average yearly temperature is around {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|14|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night. In the coldest months, the average temperature is {{convert|12|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|6|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night. In the warmest months – July and August – the average temperature is {{convert|28|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night. The daily temperature range is limited, with an average range of about {{convert|6|C-change|0}} between high and low temperatures. Genoa also sees significant moderation from the sea, in stark contrast to areas behind the Ligurian mountains such as [[Parma]], where summers are hotter and winters are quite cold.

Annually, the average 2.9 of nights recorded temperatures of ≤{{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}} (mainly in January). The coldest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|-8|°C|0|abbr=on}} in February 2012; the highest temperature ever recorded during the day is {{convert|38.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August 2015. Average annual number of days with temperatures of ≥{{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} is about 8, four days in July and August.<ref name=ServizioMeteorologico/>

Average annual temperature of the sea is {{convert|17.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}, from {{convert|13|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the period January–March to {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}} in August. In the period from June to October, the average sea temperature exceeds {{convert|19|°C|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="weather2travel">{{cite web |url=http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/italy/genoa.php |title=Genoa Climate Guide |website=Weather2travel.com |access-date=14 August 2018 |archive-date=23 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111123012225/http://www.weather2travel.com/climate-guides/italy/genoa.php |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Genoa is also a windy city, especially during winter when [[Tramontane|northern winds]] often bring cool air from the [[Po Valley]] (usually accompanied by lower temperatures, high pressure and clear skies). Another typical wind blows from [[Sirocco|southeast]], mostly as a consequence of Atlantic disturbances and storms, bringing humid and warmer air from the sea. Snowfall is sporadic, but does occur almost every year, albeit big amounts in the city centre are rare.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nimbus.it/liguria/rlm44/neve_mediterraneo.htm |title=La neve sulle coste del Mediterraneo |website=Nimbus.it|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nimbus.it/liguria/rlm50/statistica_meteorologica.htm |title=Appunti di statistica meteorologica  |website=Nimbus.it|access-date=14 August 2018}}</ref> Genoa often receives heavy rainfall in autumn from strong convection. Even so, the overall number of precipitation days is quite modest. There are on average 11.57 days annually with thunder, which is more common from May to October than other times of the year.<ref name=NCEI/>

Annual average [[relative humidity]] is 68%, ranging from 63% in February to 73% in May.<ref name=ServizioMeteorologico/>

Sunshine hours total above 2,200 per year, from an average 4 hours of sunshine duration per day in winter to average 9 hours in summer.

==Government==
===Municipal government===
The Municipal Council of Genoa is currently led by a right-wing majority, elected in June 2017. The mayor is [[Marco Bucci (politician)|Marco Bucci]], expression of a right-wing alliance composed by [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]], [[Lega Nord]], [[Brothers of Italy|Fratelli d'Italia]] and other minor lists. Genoa was traditionally considered a leftist city and Bucci is the first right-wing mayor since 1975.

====Administrative subdivision====
The city of Genoa is subdivided into nine municipi (administrative districts), as approved by the Municipal Council in 2007.<ref name = testoregolamento >{{cite web|url=https://smart.comune.genova.it/system/files/regolamenti/reg_decentramento_20200707_con_link.pdf|title=Regolamento per il decentramento e la partecipazione municipale (Regulation for decentralization and municipal participation)|website=smart.comune.genova.it|access-date=27 March 2021|archive-date=29 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529131602/https://smart.comune.genova.it/system/files/regolamenti/reg_decentramento_20200707_con_link.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Main sights===
[[File:Palazzo Ducale Genoa.jpg|thumb|[[Doge's Palace, Genoa|Doge's Palace]], ancient seat of the government of the oligarchic republic]]
[[File:Palazzo San Georgio Genova W.jpg|thumb|right|[[Palazzo San Giorgio|Palace of Saint George]], built in 1260]]

Notable to the city are the [[Palazzi dei Rolli]], included in [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] ''[[Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli]]''. The world-famous Strade Nuove are [[Via Garibaldi (Genoa)|via Garibaldi]] (Strada Nuova), [[Via Cairoli (Genoa)|via Cairoli]] (Strada Nuovissima) and [[Via Balbi (Genoa)|via Balbi]] (Strada Balbi). Among the most important palaces are the [[Palazzo Rosso]], [[Palazzo Bianco]], Palazzo Podestà o di Nicolosio Lomellino, [[Palazzo Reale (Genoa)|Palazzo Reale]], [[Palazzo Angelo Giovanni Spinola]], [[Palazzo Pietro Spinola di San Luca]] and [[Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria]].

Genoa's [[Historic center of Genoa|historic centre]] is articulated in a maze of squares and narrow ''caruggi'' (typical Genoese alleys). It joins a [[medieval]] dimension with following 16th century and [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] interventions (the ancient Via Aurea, now [[Via Garibaldi (Genoa)|Via Garibaldi]]).

Near [[Via Garibaldi (Genoa)|Via Garibaldi]], through the public elevator Castelletto Levante, one can reach one of the most scenic places in the city, [[Castelletto (Genoa)|Belvedere Castelletto]]. The centre of Genoa is connected to its upper part by ancient paths caught between tall palaces, called ''creuze''. Walking along these small paths one can reach magnificent places like the Santuario di Nostra Signora di Loreto. Very beautiful is the upper ring road so-called Circonvallazione a Monte that includes Corso Firenze, Corso Paganini, Corso Magenta, Via Solferino, and Corso Armellini.

[[Saint Lawrence Cathedral|San Lorenzo cathedral]] has a splendid portal and the dome designed by [[Galeazzo Alessi]]. Inside is found the treasure of the Cathedral where among other objects there is also what is said to be the [[Holy Chalice]].

The symbols of the city are the [[Lighthouse of Genoa|Lanterna]] (the lighthouse) ({{convert|117|m|abbr=off}} high), old and standing lighthouse visible in the distance from the sea (beyond {{convert|30|km|abbr=off}}), and the monumental fountain of [[Piazza De Ferrari (Genoa)|Piazza De Ferrari]], recently restored, out-and-out core of the city's life. Near [[Piazza De Ferrari (Genoa)|Piazza De Ferrari]] and [[Teatro Carlo Felice]] is the Mazzini Gallery, a typical nineteenth-century structure with many elegant shops and coffee bars.

Another tourist destination is the ancient seaside district of [[Boccadasse]] (which means "the mouth of the donkey"), with its multicolour boats, set as a seal to [[Corso Italia (Genoa)|Corso Italia]], the promenade which runs along the Lido d'Albaro, and known for its ice-creams. After Boccadasse you can continue along the sea up to [[Sturla]].

[[File:Genova-Porta Soprana-DSCF7083.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Medieval gates of Genoa are a rare survivor of the city's oldest buildings.]]
[[File:Palazzo Reale - Genova.jpg|thumb|Royal Palace of Genoa, 16th century]]
Just out of the city centre, but still part of the {{convert|33|km|0|abbr=on}} of coast included in the municipality's territory, are [[Nervi]], natural doorway to the Ligurian East [[Italian Riviera|Riviera]], and [[Pegli]], the point of access to the West [[Italian Riviera|Riviera]]. Nervi offers many attractions: the promenade overlooking the sea called {{ill|Passeggiata Anita Garibaldi|it}}; parks covered with lush tropical vegetation; numerous villas and palaces open to the public that now house museums (like GAM-Galleria d'Arte Moderna, Raccolte Frugone Museum, Museo Giannettino Luxoro and Wolfsoniana). (see also {{ill|Parchi di Nervi|it}}) The East Riviera of Genoa called Riviera di Levante is part of the [[Italian Riviera]]. East Riviera is full of interesting towns to visit, and then from Genoa to east are: [[Bogliasco]], [[Pieve Ligure]], [[Sori, Liguria|Sori]], [[Recco]], [[Camogli]], [[Portofino]], [[Santa Margherita Ligure]], [[Rapallo]], [[Zoagli]], [[Chiavari]], [[Lavagna]] and [[Sestri Levante]]. In the west, [[Pegli]] is the site of the famous [[Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini]] and [[Arenzano]] is a seaside town at the foot of the [[Parco naturale regionale del Beigua]].

The new Genoa based its rebirth upon the restoration of the green areas of the immediate inland parts, among them the [[Parco naturale regionale del Beigua]], and upon the construction of facilities such as the [[Aquarium of Genoa]] in the Old Harbour – the biggest in Italy and one of the major in Europe – and its [[Marina]] (the tourist small port which holds hundreds of pleasure boats). All of these are inside the restored Expo Area, arranged in occasion of the Columbian Celebrations of 1992.

Near the city are [[Camogli]] and [[San Fruttuoso abbey]] accessible by a daily ferry from the Old Harbour (Porto Antico) of Genoa. In the seabed in front of the San Fruttuoso abbey there is the [[Christ of the Abyss]]. From the Old Harbour one can reach by boat other famous seaside places around Genoa such as [[Portofino]] or a little more distant, [[Lerici]] and the [[Cinque Terre]].

The regained pride gave back to the city the consciousness of being capable of looking to the future without forgetting its past. The resumption of several flourishing hand-crafting activities, far-back absent from the ''caruggi'' of the old town, is a direct evidence of it. The restoration of many of Genoa's churches and palaces in the 1980s and the 1990s contributed to the city's rebirth. A notable example the [[Renaissance]], [[Santa Maria Assunta, Genoa|Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta]], sitting on the top of the hill of Carignano and visible from almost every part of the city. The total restoration of [[Doge's Palace, Genoa|Doge's Palace]] and of the Old Harbour, and the rebuilding of [[Teatro Carlo Felice]], destroyed by bombing in the [[Second World War]], were two more points of strength for the realisation of a new Genoa.

From the 1960s onward, Genoa could not avoid a significant urban renewal, which, as in many other major cities, involved building large public housing complexes. The quality, utility, and functionality of these developments have been, and remain, controversial among the residents who live there.{{Clarify|date=February 2024}} The most well-known case is that of the so-called "Biscione", a development in the shape of a long snake, situated on the hills of the populous district of [[Marassi]], and one of the group of houses known as "Le Lavatrici" (the washing machines), in the district of Prà.

Beyond a complete restyling of the area, the ancient port zone nearby the Mandraccio opening, in Porta Siberia, was enriched by Genoese architect [[Renzo Piano]] with a large sphere made of metal and glass, installed in the port's waters, not far from the [[Aquarium of Genoa]], and unveiled in 2001 in occasion of the [[G8 Summit]] held in Genoa. The sphere (called by the citizens "Piano's bubble" or "The Ball"), after hosting an exposition of fens from Genoa's Botanical Gardens, currently houses the reconstruction of a tropical environment, with several plants, little animals and butterflies.
Piano also designed the subway stations and, in the hills area, the construction – in collaboration with [[UNESCO]] – of Punta Nave, base of the [[Renzo Piano Building Workshop]].

Nearby the Old Harbour is the so-called "[[Matitone (Genoa)|Matitone]]", a skyscraper in shape of a pencil, that lays side by side with the group of the WTC towers, core of the San Benigno development, today base of part of the Municipality's administration and of several companies.

===Churches===
[[File:Genova Duomo St. Lawrence Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Genoa Cathedral|St. Lawrence Cathedral]]]]
[[Genoa Cathedral|St. Lawrence Cathedral]] (Cattedrale di San Lorenzo) is the city's cathedral, built in a Gothic-Romanesque style. Other notable historical churches are the Commandery of the [[Order of Saint John|Saint John's Order]] called {{ill|Commenda di San Giovanni di Prèl|it|Commenda di San Giovanni di Pré}}, [[San Matteo (Genoa)|San Matteo]], [[San Donato (Genoa)|San Donato]], [[Santa Maria di Castello]], [[Sant'Agostino (Genoa)|Sant'Agostino]] (deconsecrated since the 19th century, sometimes is used for theatrical representations), [[Santo Stefano (Genoa)|Santo Stefano]], [[Santi Vittore e Carlo, Genoa|Santi Vittore e Carlo]], [[Basilica della Santissima Annunziata del Vastato]], [[San Pietro in Banchi, Genoa|San Pietro in Banchi]], [[Santa Maria delle Vigne]], [[Nostra Signora della Consolazione e San Vincenzo martire (Genoa)|Nostra Signora della Consolazione]], [[San Siro (Genoa)|San Siro]], {{ill|Santa Maria Maddalena, Genoa|it|Chiesa di Santa Maria Maddalena (Genova)|lt=Santa Maria Maddalena}}, [[Santa Maria Assunta, Genoa|Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano]], [[Sant'Anna, Genoa|Sant'Anna]] and {{ill|Chiesa del Gesù e dei Santi Ambrogio e Andrea|it}}. [[San Bartolomeo degli Armeni]] houses the [[Image of Edessa]] and [[San Pancrazio, Genoa|San Pancrazio]] after the World War II was entrusted to the ligurian delegation of the [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]]. These churches and basilicas are built in Romanesque (San Donato, Santa Maria di Castello, Commenda di San Giovanni di Pré), Gothic (San Matteo, Santo Stefano, Sant'Agostino), Baroque (San Siro) or Renaissance (Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano, San Pietro in Banchi) appearance, or a mix of different styles (Nostra Signora della Consolazione, Santissima Annunziata del Vastato; this last has a Baroque interior and a Neoclassicist façade).

[[File:Genova Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano.jpg|thumb|right|Santa Maria Assunta di Carignano]]
Another well known Genoese church is the shrine of [[Francis of Paola|Saint Francis of Paola]], notable for the outer courtyard overlooking the port and the memorial to all those who died at sea. This church is of artistic mention in that the tile depictions of the [[Stations of the Cross|Via Crucis]] Stations along the brick path to the church.

Near Genoa is found the [[Shrine of Nostra Signora della Guardia]], (the sanctuary is said to have inspired the writer [[Umberto Eco]] in making his novel [[The Name of the Rose]]). Another interesting church in the neighborhoods of Genoa is [[San Siro di Struppa]].

The city was the birthplace of several popes ([[Pope Innocent IV|Innocent IV]], [[Pope Adrian V|Adrian V]], [[Pope Innocent VIII|Innocent VIII]], and [[Pope Benedict XV|Benedict XV]]) and various saints ([[Syrus of Genoa]], [[Romulus of Genoa]], [[Catherine of Genoa]], and [[Virginia Centurione Bracelli]]). The Archbishop of Genoa [[Jacobus de Voragine]] wrote the [[Golden Legend]]. Also from Genoa were: [[Giovanni Paolo Oliva]], the [[Superior General of the Society of Jesus]]; [[Girolamo Grimaldi-Cavalleroni]], the Archbishop of Aix; [[Ausonio Franchi]], priest, philosopher, and theologian; Cardinal [[Giuseppe Siri]]; and the priests [[Francesco Repetto]], [[Giuseppe Dossetti]], [[Gianni Baget Bozzo]], and [[Don Andrea Gallo|Andrea Gallo]]. The present archbishop of Genoa, Cardinal [[Angelo Bagnasco]], comes from a Genoese family but was born in [[Pontevico]], near [[Brescia]] (see also [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Genoa|Archdiocese of Genoa]]).

===Buildings and palaces===
[[File:Genoa Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli-113860.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Mirror Gallery of the Royal Palace]]
The main features of central Genoa include the [[Piazza De Ferrari (Genoa)|Piazza De Ferrari]], around which are the [[Teatro Carlo Felice|Opera]] and the [[Palazzo Ducale (Genoa)|Palace of the Doges]]. Nearby, just outside the medieval city walls, is located [[Christopher Columbus House]] where [[Christopher Columbus]] is said to have lived as a child, although the current building is an 18th-century reconstruction of the original which was destroyed by the French naval bombing of 1684.

In the old port area called [[Porto Antico]], is located [[Palazzo di San Giorgio]]. In the Middle Ages, this palace was the headquarters of the [[Bank of Saint George]]. In its prisons, [[Marco Polo]] and [[Rustichello da Pisa]] composed [[The Travels of Marco Polo]].

[[File:Via Garibaldi di notte (Genova).jpg|thumb|upright|Via Garibaldi by night]]
[[Via Garibaldi (Genoa)|Strada Nuova]] (now Via Garibaldi), in the old city, alongside [[Via Cairoli]] and [[via Balbi]], was inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]] in 2006. This district was designed in the mid-16th century to accommodate Mannerist palaces built by the city's most eminent families.

Of the many palaces built by the nobility in the city center of Genoa, 114 have not been substantially altered (see also [[Rolli di Genova]]): among these, 42 ''[[Palazzi dei Rolli]]'' are  inscribed on the [[World Heritage List]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Genoa: Le Strade Nuove and the system of the Palazzi dei Rolli |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1211/}}</ref> The most famous are [[Palazzo Rosso (Genoa)|Palazzo Rosso]], [[Palazzo Bianco (Genoa)|Palazzo Bianco]], [[Palazzo Tursi|Palazzo Doria Tursi]], [[Palazzo Gerolamo Grimaldi]], [[Palazzo Nicolosio Lomellino|Palazzo Podestà]], [[Palazzo Reale (Genoa)|Palazzo Reale]], [[Palazzo Angelo Giovanni Spinola]], [[Palazzo Pietro Spinola di San Luca]], [[Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria]], [[Palazzo Cicala]]. Palazzo Bianco, Palazzo Rosso and Palazzo Doria Tursi are also known as ''Musei di Strada Nuova'' and host the renowned art collection bequeathed to the city by the Genoese filantropist [[Maria Brignole Sale De Ferrari]], Duchess of Galliera, as well as the violins of the Genoese violinist Niccolò Paganini.<ref>{{cite web |title=Strada Nuova Museums |url=https://www.museidigenova.it/en/strada-nuova-museums}}</ref> The Flemish artist and diplomat [[Peter Paul Rubens]] wrote [[Palazzi di Genova]] in 1622, a book with his own depiction of the palaces of Genoa in the 17th century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rubens |first1=Pieter Paul |title=Palazzi di Genova |date=2001 |publisher=Tormena |edition=J. M. Rosenberg}}</ref>

The [[Genoese Renaissance]] began with the construction of [[Villa del Principe]] commissioned by [[Andrea Doria]]: the architects were [[Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli]] and [[Giovanni Ponzello]], the interior was painted by [[Perino del Vaga]] and the garden fountain was realised by [[Taddeo Carlone]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Catalogo delle Ville Genovesi |date=1967 |publisher=Italia Nostra |location=Genova |pages=79–97}}</ref>

In 1548 [[Galeazzo Alessi]], with the project of {{ill|Villa Giustiniani-Cambiaso|it}}, designed a new prototype of Genoese palace that would be an inspiration to other architects working in Genoa as [[Bartolomeo Bianco]], [[Pietro Antonio Corradi]], [[Rocco Lurago]], [[Giovan Battista Castello]], and [[Bernardino Cantone]].

Scattered around the city are many villas, built between the fifteenth and the twentieth centuries. Among the best known are: {{ill|Villa Brignole Sale Duchessa di Galliera|it}}, [[Villa Durazzo-Pallavicini]], {{ill|Villa Doria Centurione|it}}, {{ill|Villa Durazzo Bombrini|it}}, {{ill|Villa Serra|it}}, Villa Giustiniani-Cambiaso, {{ill|Villa Rossi Martini|it}}, {{ill|Villa Imperiale Scassi|it}}, {{ill|Villa Grimaldi, Genoa|it|Villa Grimaldi (La Fortezza)|lt=Villa Grimaldi}}, {{ill|Villa Negrone Moro|it}}, [[Villa Rosazza]], {{ill|Villetta Di Negro|it}}, [[Villa delle Peschiere]], {{ill|Villa Imperiale|it|Villa Imperiale (Genova)}}, {{ill|Villa Saluzzo Bombrini|it}}, and {{ill|Villa Grimaldi Fassio|it|Raccolte Frugone}}.

[[File:Cimitero staglieno-veduta2-wiki.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|Staglieno: A monumental cemetery]]
As it regards the 19th century remember the architects Ignazio Gardella (senior), and [[Carlo Barabino]] which among other things, realises together with Giovanni Battista Resasco, the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]]. The cemetery is renowned for its statues and sepulchral monuments that preserve the mortal remains of notable personalities, including [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], [[Fabrizio De André]], and [[Constance Lloyd]] (Oscar Wilde's wife). In the first half of the 19th century they are completed the {{ill|Albergo dei Poveri (Genoa)|it|Albergo dei Poveri (Genova)|lt=Albergo dei Poveri}} and the {{ill|Acquedotto storico|it|Acquedotto storico di Genova}}. In 1901 {{ill|Giovanni Antonio Porcheddu|it}} realised the ''Silos Granari''.

[[File:Genova - Piazza della Vittoria.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Arco della Vittoria]]]]
The city is rich in testimony of the [[Gothic Revival]] like [[Albertis Castle]], {{ill|Castello Bruzzo|it}}, {{ill|Villa Canali Gaslini|it}} and [[Mackenzie Castle]] designed by the architect [[Gino Coppedè]]. Genoa is also rich of [[Art Nouveau]] works, among which: [[Palazzo della Borsa (Genova)]], [[Via XX Settembre (Genoa)|Via XX Settembre]] (Gino Coppedè, [[Gaetano Orzali]] and others), [[Hotel Bristol Palace]], {{ill|Grand Hotel Miramare|it}} and {{ill|Stazione marittima|it|Stazione marittima di Genova}}. Works of Rationalist architecture of the first half of the 20th century are [[Terrazza Martini Tower|Torre Piacentini]] and Piazza della Vittoria where [[Arco della Vittoria]], both designed by the architect [[Marcello Piacentini]]. Other architects who have changed the face of Genoa in the 20th century are: [[Ignazio Gardella]], {{ill|Luigi Carlo Daneri|it}} who realised the [[Piazza Rossetti]] and the residential complex so-called {{ill|Il Biscione|it|Biscione (Genova)}}, {{ill|Mario Labò|it}}, [[Aldo Rossi]], [[Ludovico Quaroni]], [[Franco Albini]] who designed the interiors of [[Palazzo Rosso]], and {{ill|Piero Gambacciani|it}}. The [[Edoardo Chiossone Museum of Oriental Art]], designed by Mario Labò, has one of the largest collections of Oriental art in Europe.

Other notable architectural works include: the Old Harbour's new design with the [[Aquarium of Genoa|Aquarium]], the {{ill|Bigo (Genoa)|it|Bigo (Genova)|lt=Bigo}} and the {{ill|Biosfera|it|Biosfera (Genova)}} by [[Renzo Piano]], the [[Palasport di Genova]], the [[Matitone]] skyscraper, and the {{ill|Padiglione B of Genoa Fair|it|Padiglione B della Fiera di Genova}}, by [[Jean Nouvel]]. Genoa was home to the [[Ponte Morandi]] by [[Riccardo Morandi]], built in 1967, collapsed in 2018 and demolished February–June 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.domusweb.it/en/news/2018/12/17/demolition-of-morandi-bridge-begins-in-genoa.html|title=Demolition of Genoa's Ponte Morandi is underway|last=Mascolo|first=Olga|date=17 December 2018|website=www.domusweb.it|language=en-gb|access-date=17 August 2019}}</ref>

===Old Harbour===
[[File:Пираты Карибского моря-1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Neptune (galleon)|galleon Neptune]] in the Old Harbour]]
The Old Harbour ("Porto Antico" in Italian) is the ancient part of the port of Genoa. The harbour gave access to outside communities creating a good geographical situation for the city.<ref name=":0">Shaw, C. (2012). Genoa. In A. Gamberini & I. Lazzarini (Eds.). ''The Italian Renaissance State''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press</ref> The city is spread out geographically along a section of the Liguria coast, which makes trading by ship possible. Before the development of car, train, and airplane travel, the main outside access for the city was the sea, as the surrounding mountains made trade north by land more difficult than coastal trade. Trade routes have always connected Genoa on an international scale, with increasingly farther reach starting from trade along Europe's coastline before the medieval period to today's connection across continents.<ref>Tonizzi, Maria Elisabetta. "Genoa." ''History of World Trade Since 1450'', edited by [[John J. McCusker]], vol. 1, Macmillan Reference USA, 2006, pp. 311–312. ''Gale Virtual Reference Library.''</ref> In its heyday the [[Genoese Navy]] was a prominent power in the Mediterranean.

As the Genoa harbour was so important to the merchants for their own economic success, other nearby harbours and ports were seen as competition for a landing point for foreign traders.  In the 16th century, the Genovese worked to destroy the local shipping competition, the Savona harbour.<ref name=":0"/> Taking matters into their own hands, the Genoa merchants and the politically powerful in Genoa attacked the harbour of Savona with stones.<ref name=":0"/> This action was taken to preserve the economic stability and wealth of the city during the rise in prominence of Savona. The Genovese would go as far as to war with other coastal, trading cities such as Venice,<ref name=":0"/> to protect the trade industry.

[[Renzo Piano]] redeveloped the area for public access, restoring the historical buildings (like the Cotton warehouses) and creating new landmarks like the Aquarium, the Bigo and recently the "Bolla" (the Sphere). The main touristic attractions of this area are the famous Aquarium and the Museum of the Sea (MuMA). In 2007 these attracted almost 1.7&nbsp;million visitors.<ref>Fonte: ''[[Il Secolo XIX]]'', 17 ottobre 2008, pag. 25</ref>

===Walls and fortresses===
{{Main|Walls of Genoa}}
[[File:Le torri di Porta Soprana, Genova.jpg|thumb|upright|The Porta Soprana]]
The city of Genoa during its long history at least since the ninth century had been protected by different lines of [[defensive wall]]s. Large portions of these walls remain today, and Genoa has more and longer walls than any other city in Italy. The main [[city walls]] are known as "Ninth century walls", "Barbarossa Walls" (12th century), "Fourteenth century walls", "Sixteenth century walls" and "New Walls" ("Mura Nuove" in Italian). The more imposing walls, built in the first half of the 17th century on the ridge of hills around the city, have a length of almost {{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}}. Some fortresses stand along the perimeter of the "New Walls" or close them.

===Aquarium of Genoa===
The [[Aquarium of Genoa]] (in {{langx|it|Acquario di Genova}}) is the largest [[aquarium]] in Italy and among the largest in Europe. Built for [[Genoa Expo '92]], it is an educational, scientific and cultural centre. Its mission is to educate and raise public awareness as regards conservation, management and responsible use of aquatic environments. It welcomes over 1.2&nbsp;million visitors a year.

Control of the entire environment, including the temperature, filtration and lighting of the tanks was provided by local Automation Supplier Orsi Automazione, acquired in 2001 by [[Siemens]].
The Aquarium of Genoa is co-ordinating the AquaRing EU project. It also provides scientific expertise and a great deal of content for AquaRing, including documents, images, academic content and interactive online courses, via its Online Resource Centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aquaringweb.eu/index.html |title=AquaRing – home |language=it |date=12 October 2007 |access-date=25 July 2009 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012082449/http://www.aquaringweb.eu/index.html |archive-date = 12 October 2007}}</ref>

At the beginning of 2011, there were 608,493 people residing in Genoa, of whom 47% were male and 53% were female.

Genoa has the lowest birth rate and is the most aged of any large Italian city. Minors (children ages 18 and younger) totalled only 14.12% of the population compared to pensioners who number 26.67%. This compares with the Italian average of 18.06% (minors) and 19.94% (pensioners). The median age of Genoa's residents is 47, compared to the Italian average of 42. The current birth rate of the city is only 7.49 births per 1,000 inhabitants, compared to the national average of 9.45.

Ligurian agriculture has increased its specialisation pattern in high-quality products (flowers, [[Italian wine|wine]], [[olive oil]]) and has thus managed to maintain the gross value-added per worker at a level much higher than the national average (the difference was about 42% in 1999).<ref name="regportraits1">{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc3_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |website=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=5 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916185647/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc3_eco.htm |archive-date=16 September 2008 }}</ref> The value of flower production represents over 75% of the agriculture sector turnover, followed by animal farming (11.2%) and vegetable growing (6.4%).

Steel, once a major industry during the booming 1950s and 1960s, phased out after the late 1980s crisis, as Italy moved away from the heavy industry to pursue more technologically advanced and less polluting productions. So the Ligurian industry has turned towards a widely diversified range of high-quality and high-tech products (food, shipbuilding (in [[Sestri Ponente]] and in metropolitan area – [[Sestri Levante]]), electrical engineering and electronics, petrochemicals, aerospace etc.). Nonetheless, the regions still maintains a flourishing shipbuilding sector (yacht construction and maintenance, cruise liner building, military shipyards).<ref name="regportraits1"/>

In the services sector, the gross value-added per worker in Liguria is 4% above the national average. This is due to the increasing diffusion of modern technologies, particularly in commerce and tourism.
A good motorway network ({{convert|376|km|0|abbr=on}} in 2000) makes communications with the border regions relatively easy. The main motorway is located along the coastline, connecting the main ports of Nice (in France), Savona, Genoa and La Spezia. The number of passenger cars per 1000 inhabitants (524 in 2001) is below the national average (584).

{{main|Railway stations in Genoa}}
[[File:IT GE Brignole FS.JPG|thumb|[[Genova Brignole railway station]]]]
[[File:Genova staz Principe ingresso.jpg|thumb|[[Genova Piazza Principe railway station]]]]
The main railway stations are [[Genova Brignole railway station|Genoa Brignole]] in the east and [[Genova Piazza Principe railway station|Genoa Principe]] in the west. Genoa Brignole is close to the business districts and the exhibition centre, while the Principe is close to the port, the university and the historical centre. From these two stations depart the main trains connecting Genoa to France, Turin, Milan and Rome.

Genoa's third most important station is [[Genova Sampierdarena railway station|Genoa Sampierdarena]], which serves the densely populated neighbourhood of Sampierdarena. 23 other local stations serve the other neighbourhoods on the 30-kilometre-long coast line from [[Nervi]] to [[Voltri]] and on the northern line through [[Bolzaneto]] and the Polcevera Valley.

The municipal administration of Genoa plans to transform these urban railway lines to be part of the rapid transit system, which now consists of the ''Metropolitana di Genova'' ([[Genoa Metro]]), a [[light metro]] connecting Brin to the city centre. The metro line was extended to Brignole Station in December 2012. Trains currently pass through Corvetto station between De Ferrari and Brignole without stopping. A possible further extension towards the eastern, densely populated boroughs was planned, but the municipal administration intends to improve the public transport by investing in new tram lines instead of completing the extension of the light metro.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mobilitypoint.it/InfomobilityWeb/portal/alias__Rainbow/lang__it-IT/tabID__3509/sitemap/archivio_news/news_metropolitana.aspx |title=Mobility Point and local press |website=Mobilitypoint.it |date=22 August 2007 |access-date=11 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722042152/http://www.mobilitypoint.it/InfomobilityWeb/portal/alias__Rainbow/lang__it-IT/tabID__3509/sitemap/archivio_news/news_metropolitana.aspx |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The current stations of the metro line are Brin-Certosa, Dinegro, Principe, Darsena, San Giorgio, Sant'Agostino and De Ferrari, and the line is {{convert|5.3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long.

This creative environment also attracted the two most important Flemish painters, [[Rubens]] and [[Van Dyck]], who along with [[Bernardo Strozzi]].<ref name="premier.net">{{cite web|url=http://www.premier.net/~Italy/genoa3.htm |title=Art And Culture In And Around Genoa |website=Premier.net |access-date=12 April 2011}}</ref> gave life to the Genoese Painting School of the 17th century.

Much of the city's art is found in its churches and palaces, where there are numerous Renaissance, Baroque and Rococo frescos. They are rich in works of art the [[Genoa Cathedral|Cathedral]], the {{ill|Chiesa del Gesù e dei Santi Ambrogio e Andrea|it}} where [[The Circumcision (Rubens)|''The Circumcision'']] and the "''Miracles of St. Ignatius''" by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], the ''Assunzione della Vergine'' by [[Guido Reni]]. The [[San Donato (Genoa)|Church of San Donato]] contains works of [[Barnaba da Modena]], [[Nicolò da Voltri]] and [[Joos van Cleve]],<ref name="premier.net"/> the [[Santo Stefano (Genoa)|Church of Santo Stefano]] {{ill|The Stoning of St. Stephen|it|Lapidazione di santo Stefano (Giulio Romano)}} by [[Giulio Romano]] and the [[Santa Maria Assunta, Genoa|Church of Santa Maria Assunta]] the sculptures by [[Filippo Parodi]] and [[Pierre Puget]], very interesting is the [[Santa Maria di Castello]]. But most of the works are kept in the Palaces like [[Palazzo Bianco]] where "[[Ecce Homo (Caravaggio, Genoa)|''Ecce Homo'']]" by [[Caravaggio]], "[[Susannah and the Elders (Veronese)|''Susannah and the Elders'']]" by [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]], and the ''[[Garden Party in Albaro]]'' by [[Alessandro Magnasco|Magnasco]] are kept, [[Palazzo Rosso]] with the {{ill|Portrait of Anton Giulio Brignole-Sale|it|Ritratto equestre di Anton Giulio Brignole-Sale}} by [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]], [[The Dying Cleopatra|''Cleopatra morente'']] by [[Guercino]] and works of [[Albrecht Dürer|Dürer]], [[Bernardo Strozzi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]; [[Palazzo Spinola di Pellicceria]] where the "''[[Portrait of Giovanni Carlo Doria on Horseback]]''" by [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]] and {{ill|Ecce Homo (Antonello da Messina, Genoa)|it|Ecce Homo (Antonello da Messina Genova)|lt=''Ecce Homo''}} by [[Antonello da Messina]] (see also [[Ecce Homo (Antonello da Messina)|the series of Ecce Homo by Antonello da Messina]]) are kept, [[Palazzo Tursi]] with the [[Penitent Magdalene (Canova)|Penitent Magdalene]] by [[Antonio Canova|Canova]], and [[Palazzo Reale]] which contains works of [[Bernardo Strozzi|Strozzi]], [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli|Gaulli]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Anthony van Dyck|van Dyck]], [[Simon Vouet]], [[Guercino]].

The most important Genoese painters are: [[Luca Cambiasi|Luca Cambiaso]], [[Bernardo Castello|Bernardo]] and [[Valerio Castello]], [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]], [[Domenico Piola|Domenico]] and [[Paolo Gerolamo Piola]], [[Gregorio De Ferrari]], [[Bernardo Strozzi]], [[Giovanni Battista Gaulli]] and [[Alessandro Magnasco]]. Sculptors include [[Filippo Parodi]], the wood sculptor [[Anton Maria Maragliano]], [[Francesco Maria Schiaffino]] and [[Agostino Carlini]] who was member of the [[Royal Academy]].

The famous humanist author, architect, poet and philosopher [[Leon Battista Alberti]] was born in Genoa on 14 February 1404. [[Simonetta Vespucci]], considered the most beautiful woman of her time, was also born in Genoa. She is portrayed in ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' and [[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]] by [[Sandro Botticelli]] and in [[Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci (Piero di Cosimo)|''Portrait of Simonetta Vespucci'']] by [[Piero di Cosimo]].

Genoa is also famous for its numerous tapestries, which decorated the city's many salons. Whilst the patrician palaces and villas in the city were and still are austere and majestic, the interiors tended to be luxurious and elaborate, often full of tapestries, many of which were Flemish.<ref name="premier.net"/> Famous is the [[Genoese lace]] called with its name of Turkish origin ''macramè''. Very used in Genoa is the [[cobblestone]] called ''Risseu'' and a kind of [[azulejo]] called ''laggioni''.

Genoa has been likened by many to a Mediterranean New York, perhaps for its high houses that in the Middle Ages were the equivalent of today's skyscrapers, perhaps for the sea route Genoa-New York which in past centuries has been travelled by millions of emigrants. The architect [[Renzo Picasso]] in his visionary designs reinforces this strange affinity between the two cities.

In the [[Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno]], you can admire some magnificent sculpture of the 19th century and early 20th century like [[Monteverde Angel]] by [[Giulio Monteverde]], or works by artists such as [[Augusto Rivalta]], [[Leonardo Bistolfi]], [[Edoardo Alfieri]], [[Santo Varni]].

Amongst the most notable Genoese painters of the 19th century and of the first half of the 20th century are [[Tammar Luxoro]], [[Ernesto Rayper]], [[Rubaldo Merello]], and Antonio Giuseppe Santagata. The sculptor [[Francesco Messina]] also grew up in Genoa.

In 1967 the Genoese historian, critic and curator [[Germano Celant]] coined the term [[Arte Povera]]. [[Enrico Accatino]] was another important art theorist and [[Emanuele Luzzati]] was the production designer and illustrator like [[Lorenzo Mongiardino]], also a production designer and architect. Two other important artists are [[Emilio Scanavino]] and [[Vanessa Beecroft]].

The yearly [[International Cartoonists Exhibition]] was founded in 1972 in [[Rapallo]], near Genoa. A notable figure is the illustrator and comics artist [[Giovan Battista Carpi]].

===Literature===
[[File:Umbria, jacopo da varazze, leggenda aurea, 1290 ca. 01.jpg|thumb|''[[Golden Legend]]'', 1290]]

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Genoa}}
[[File:Teatro Carlo Felice Notturno.JPG|thumb|The neoclassical [[Teatro Carlo Felice]]]]
Genoa was a centre of [[Occitan literature|Occitan culture]] in Italy and for this reason it developed an important school of [[troubadour]]s: [[Lanfranc Cigala]], [[Jacme Grils]], [[Bonifaci Calvo]], [[Luchetto Gattilusio]], [[Guillelma de Rosers]], and [[Simon Doria]].

Genoa is the birthplace of the composer [[Simone Molinaro]], violinist and composer [[Niccolò Paganini]], violinist [[Camillo Sivori]] and composer [[Cesare Pugni]]. In addition, the famous violin maker [[Paolo de Barbieri]]. Paganini's violin, [[Il Cannone Guarnerius]], is kept in Palazzo Tursi. The city is the site of the [[Niccolò Paganini Music Conservatory]] which was originally established as the Scuola Gratuita di Canto in 1829.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia |author=Maria Rosa Moretti|title=Genoa |date=2001|entry=Genoa (It. Genova)  |encyclopedia=Grove Music Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |doi=10.1093/gmo/9781561592630.article.10871}}</ref>

[[Alessandro Stradella]], a composer of the middle baroque, lived in Genoa and was assassinated in 1682.

[[Felice Romani]] was a poet who wrote many librettos for the opera composers like [[Gaetano Donizetti]] and [[Vincenzo Bellini]]. [[Giovanni Ruffini]] was another poet known for writing the libretto of the opera ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' for its composer.

In 1847, [[Goffredo Mameli]] and [[Michele Novaro]] composed "{{Lang|it|[[Il Canto degli Italiani]]|italic=no}}".

In 1857, debuted the work of [[Giuseppe Verdi]] entitled ''[[Simon Boccanegra]]'' inspired by the first Doge of Genoa, Simone Boccanegra.

Genoa is also the birthplace of the condcuctor [[Fabio Luisi]] and of many opera singers like [[Giuseppe Taddei]], [[Margherita Carosio]], [[Luciana Serra]], {{ill|Ottavio Garaventa|it}}, [[Luisa Maragliano]] and [[Daniela Dessì]].

The oldest theatre in Genoa was the [[Teatro del Falcone]]. Active since the 16th century, it was the second public theatre in Italy, only preceded by the one in the [[Republic of Venice]].<ref name=beniculturali>{{cite web|url=http://www.palazzorealegenova.beniculturali.it/teatro/teatro.html|title=Teatro del falcone|archive-date=2018-04-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408063615/http://palazzorealegenova.beniculturali.it/teatro/teatro.html}}</ref> It was followed by the Teatro delle Vigne which, however, along with other important theaters in the city (Teatro Margherita, [[Teatro Paganini]], Teatro Colombo), was demolished between the 19th and 20th centuries, either to make way for urban expansion or due to damage caused by [[Bombing of Genoa in World War II|bombing of Genoa]] during [[World War II]].

The [[Teatro Carlo Felice]], the main opera theatre in the city, was built in 1828 in the Piazza De Ferrari, and named for the monarch of the then [[Kingdom of Sardinia]] (which included the present regions of [[Sardinia]], Piedmont and [[Liguria]]). The theatre was the centre of music and social life in the 19th century. On various occasions in the history of the theatre, presentations have been conducted by [[Pietro Mascagni|Mascagni]], [[Richard Strauss]], [[Paul Hindemith|Hindemith]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]]. Other prominente Genoese theaters are the [[Teatro Nazionale di Genoa]], Politeama Genovese, Teatro di Sant'Agostino and Teatro Gustavo Modena.

On the occasion of the [[Christopher Columbus]] celebration in 1992, new musical life was given to the area around the old port, including the restoration of the house of [[Niccolò Paganini|Paganini]] and presentations of the ''[[trallalero]]'', the traditional singing of Genoese dock workers.

The trallalero, traditional music in the Genoese dialect, is a [[polyphonic]] vocal music, performed by five men and several songs. The [[trallalero]] are ancient songs that have their roots in the Mediterranean tradition. Another aspect of the traditional Genoese music is the "Nostalgic Song". The principal authors and singers of the Nostalgic Song in Genoese dialect are {{ill|Mario Cappello|it}} who wrote the piece "[[Ma se ghe penso]]" (English: "But if I think about it"), a memory of Genoa by an emigrant to Argentina, {{ill|Giuseppe Marzari|it}}, {{ill|Agostino Dodero (composer)|it|Agostino Dodero|lt=Agostino Dodero}} up to {{ill|I Trilli|it}}, {{ill|Piero Parodi|it}}, [[Buby Senarega]], {{ill|Franca Lai|it}}. The traditional Nostalgic Song will have a great influence on the so-called ''[[Scuola Genovese]]'' (Genoese School) of singer-songwriters that in some cases will mix the nostalgic feeling with pop and jazz atmospheres.

The singer [[Natalino Otto]] started the swing genre in Italy and his friend and colleague [[Pippo Barzizza]] was a composer, arranger, conductor and music director. Other musicians, composers and arrangers are [[Angelo Francesco Lavagnino]], [[Gian Piero Reverberi]], [[Gian Franco Reverberi]], [[Oscar Prudente]], [[Pivio and Aldo De Scalzi]].

Genoa in the second half of the 20th century was famous for an important school of Italian singer-songwriters, so-called ''[[Scuola Genovese]]'', that includes [[Umberto Bindi]], [[Luigi Tenco]]", "[[Gino Paoli]]", "[[Bruno Lauzi]]", "[[Fabrizio de André]], [[Ivano Fossati]], [[Angelo Branduardi]]" and [[Francesco Baccini]]. [[Nino Ferrer]] was also born in Genoa. In the 70s there were formed in Genoa numerous bands of [[Italian progressive rock]] like [[New Trolls]], [[Picchio dal Pozzo]], [[Latte e Miele]], and Delirium. Today we point the band [[Buio Pesto]] and [[The Banshee (band)|The Banshee]] band.

Some songs about the city of Genoa are part of Italian popular culture, like "[[Via del Campo]]" and "La Città Vecchia", both by [[Fabrizio de André]], "Genova per noi" by [[Paolo Conte]], "La Casa in Via del Campo" the song also sung by [[Amalia Rodrigues]] and "Piazza Alimonda" the song about the facts of [[27th G8 summit|Genoa 2001]] by [[Francesco Guccini]].

[[Fabrizio de André]] in 1984 released the album ''[[Crêuza de mä]]'', totally written in Genoese dialect.

I Madrigalisti di Genova is a vocal and instrumental group formed in 1958 which specialised in medieval and Renaissance repertoire

The city has numerous music festivals, among which are Concerts at [[San Fruttuoso abbey]], Premio Paganini, I Concerti di San Torpete, International Music Festival Genova, We Love Jazz, Gezmatz Festival & Workshop, and Goa-Boa Festival. In the town of [[Santa Margherita Ligure]] the ancient abbey of Cervara is often the site of chamber music.
