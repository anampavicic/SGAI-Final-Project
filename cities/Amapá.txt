'''Amapá''' ({{IPA|pt|amaˈpa||Pt-br_Amapá.ogg}}) is one of the 26 [[federative units of Brazil|states]] of [[Brazil]]. It is in the [[North Region, Brazil|North Region of Brazil]]. It is [[Federative units of Brazil#List|the second-least populous state and the eighteenth-largest state by area]]. Located in the far northern part of the country, Amapá is bordered clockwise by [[French Guiana]] to the north for 730 km, the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east for 578 km, [[Pará]] to the south and west, and [[Suriname]] to the northwest for 63 km. The capital and largest city is [[Macapá]]. The state has 0.4% of the Brazilian population and is responsible for only 0.22% of the Brazilian [[gross domestic product|GDP]].

In the colonial period the region was called '''Portuguese Guiana''' and was part of [[Portuguese Empire|Portugal]]'s [[State of Brazil]]. Later, the region was distinguished from the other [[The Guianas|Guianas]]. Amapá was once part of Pará, but became a separate territory in 1943, and the decision to make it a state was made in 1988.<ref name="b"/> The first state legislators took office on 1 January 1991.

The dominant feature of the region, and 90 percent of its total area, is the [[Amazon rainforest]]. Unexplored forests occupy 70 percent of Amapá, and [[Tumucumaque Mountains National Park]], established in 2002, is the largest tropical forest park in the world. The mouth of the [[Oyapock River|River Oiapoque]] is the northern end of Brazil's coastline.

==History==
During the colonial era from 1637 to 1654 the Amapá region was merged into the Captaincy of Pará, which was the [[Captaincy of Cabo de Norte]].<ref name="p"/> In the early colonial period the Amapá region was a rich source of [[wood|lumber]], [[resin]]s, [[annatto]], vegetable oils, and [[salted fish]], all of which were exported to Europe. The French established [[sugarcane]] plantations in this period.

[[File:Visata de dentro da Fortaleza de São José de Macapá.JPG|thumb|left|[[São José de Macapá]]]]
With the discovery of mineral deposits the Amapá region was invaded by the [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]], who were ultimately repelled by the [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]].<ref name="p"/> The [[Treaty of Utrecht]] in 1713 established the boundaries between the [[Colonial Brazil|colony of Brazil]] and [[French Guiana]], but these were not respected by the French. A fort was constructed at [[São José de Macapá]], in present-day Macapá, as a base of Portuguese power in the region.<ref name="p"/> In the 18th century, France retook control of the area. This international dispute continued until 1900.

The discovery of [[gold]] and the increasing value of [[Natural rubber|rubber]] on the international market during the 19th century increased the Portuguese population of Amapá, bringing the dispute with France to a head. Although French settlers had established the [[Republic of Independent Guyana]] (1886–1891), Brazil challenged the Amapá claim through international arbitration in Geneva on 1 December 1900, which was found in favour of Brazil. It was subsequently incorporated into the state of [[Pará]], as ''Araguari'' after the [[Araguari River (Amapá)|Araguari River]] and in 1943 this became the federal [[territory]] of Amapá.

The discovery of rich [[manganese]] deposits in [[Serra do Navio]] in 1945 revolutionized the local economy. Manganese remains the largest source of revenue in the state.<ref name="p"/> Amapá's move to statehood was made on 5 October 1988, at the time of the promulgation of the new [[Constitution of Brazil|Brazilian Constitution]], with the first state legislators taking office at the start of 1991.

==Geography==

</gallery>
The State of Amapá possesses the lowest rate of loss of its original vegetation for any Brazilian state, estimated at only 2%. Most of the Amapá territory is covered with [[rainforest]], while the remaining areas are covered with [[savannah]] and [[plain]]s. On the Amapá coast, almost intact beaches mix with swamps, creating the largest representation of this biome in Brazil. This mixture of salt and fresh water is perfect for the food chain reproduction of several animal species. Pollution, however, is now a chronic problem in the state of Amapá. Mercury, which is used in the extraction of gold, is widely found in water sources and sewage systems in the population centers of Amapá.<ref name="p"/>

===Nature===
To protect the natural resources of the state, there are, as of 2016, 12 [[protected area]]s and five [[Indigenous territory (Brazil)|indigenous territories]] covering {{convert|10,476,117|ha}}, or 72% of the state.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tamburelli|first=Gianfranco|title=Legal Systems for the Management of Protected Areas in Italy and Ukraine: The Experiences of the Lazio and Kyiv Regions

The Tumucumaque Mountains National Park is the world's largest tropical forest [[national park]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Brazil creates largest rainforest reserve|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2210914.stm|access-date=23 August 2015|work=BBC News|date=5 April 2021}}</ref> The Cabo Orange National Park contains flooded grasslands and [[mangrove forest]]s which are important fish nurseries.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/2190 |title=Cabo Orange National Park |website=Ramsar|access-date=5 April 2021}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Amapá Köppen.svg|thumb|center|120px|Köppen map for Amapá]]
Most of Amapá has a [[Tropical monsoon climate]], a [[tropical climate]] with a short [[dry season]] and heavy rainfall for the majority of the year. In the [[Köppen climate classification]], it is classified under the letters ''Am''. [[Tropical rainforest]] is the natural vegetation, and also provides the [[Tropical rainforest climate|other climate type]] located in the state.

=== Indigenous population ===
[[File:Dia do Índio no Manga Amapá Brazil.jpg|thumb|Celebration of [[Indian Day (Brazil)|Indian Day]] in [[Manga, Amapá|Manga]]]]
The [[Amerindians]] tribes in Amapá are located in the north near the [[Oiapoque River]], and in the east in the Wayampi Indigenous Territory. All the [[Indigenous territories (Brazil)|indigenous territories]] in Amapá have been demarcated. The tribes living in Amapá are the [[Galibi do Oiapoque]], the [[Karipuna do Amapá]], the [[Palikur]], the [[Wayampi]] and the [[Galibi Marwono]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://terrasindigenas.org.br/pt-br/noticia/60143 |title=Índios do Amapá|website=Terras Indigenas|access-date=6 April 2021|language=pt}}</ref>

==Flag==
{{See also|Flag of Amapá}}
The flag was adopted by Decree No. 8 of 23 April 1984. The blue represents the sky over Amapá and justice, the green represents the native rainforest, and the yellow represents the Union and its natural resources. The black stands for the deceased who worked for the state, and the white for the will of the state to live in peace and stability. The symbol on the [[Glossary of vexillology|hoist-side]] represents the Fortress of São José, out of which the state capital grew.<ref name="f"/>

Before 1984, the state had a red-white-red flag, based on the flag of [[Pará]], and similar to the [[flag of Peru]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Estado do Amapá|url = http://www.vexilologia.com.br/ap.html|website = www.vexilologia.com.br (in Portuguese)|access-date = 2016-01-05|archive-date = 4 March 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071234/http://www.vexilologia.com.br/ap.html|url-status = dead}}</ref>
