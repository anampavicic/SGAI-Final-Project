== Etymology ==
The word ''Accra'' is derived from the [[Akan language|Akan]] word ''Nkran'' meaning "ants", a reference to the numerous anthills seen in the countryside around Accra.<ref>{{Cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gmqTBQAAQBAJ&q=accra+nkran&pg=PT23 |title=KWAME, THE LAST SLAVE FROM WEST AFRICA |last=Akuamoa |first=Geoffrey |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=978-1-291-35746-2 |language=en |chapter=The Gas |date=18 March 2013 |access-date=24 October 2020 |archive-date=17 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220217062306/https://books.google.com/books?id=gmqTBQAAQBAJ&q=accra+nkran&pg=PT23 |url-status=live }}{{self-published source|date=February 2020}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=February 2020}} The name specifically refers to [[Army ant|soldier ants]], and was applied to both the town and people by the [[Twi]] speakers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qv-AjAHjud8C&q=accra+etymology&pg=PA6 |title=Making the Town: Ga State and Society in Early Colonial Accra |last=Parker |first=John |date=1 January 2000 |publisher=ABC-CLIO, LLC |isbn=978-0-325-00190-6 |page=6 |language=en |access-date=24 October 2020 |archive-date=17 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220217062306/https://books.google.com/books?id=qv-AjAHjud8C&q=accra+etymology&pg=PA6 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HeibAAAAQBAJ&q=accra+nkran&pg=PA12 |title=Views of Africa |date=1 April 2012 |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica, Inc. |isbn=978-1-61535-571-6 |page=12 |language=en |access-date=24 October 2020 |archive-date=17 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220217062306/https://books.google.com/books?id=HeibAAAAQBAJ&q=accra+nkran&pg=PA12 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The name of Accra in the local [[Ga language]] is ''Ga'' or ''Gaga'', the same name as that of the [[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga people]] and a [[cognate]] with ''Nkran''. The word is sometimes rendered with the nasalised vowels as ''Gã'' or ''Gãgã''. Historian [[Carl Christian Reindorf]] confirmed this etymology, proposing a link between the martial qualities and migratory behaviour of the local ants and those of the Ga people. The link between the [[ethnonym]] and ants was explicitly reflected in the recognition of anthills as sacred places. Often ringed by sacred fences (''aklabatsa''), the tall red mounds dotting Accra's hinterland were seen as microcosms of human community and as nodal points between the known world and the world of the dead.<ref name=":0" />

The Ga used the reference to the invasive species of dark-red swarming ants to connote military prowess and their ancient conquest of [[Guang languages|Guang]] speakers residing in the Accra Plains.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZB2CgAAQBAJ&q=accra+nkran&pg=PA30 |title=Gold Coast Diasporas: Identity, Culture, and Power |last=Rucker |first=Walter C. |date=28 September 2015 |publisher=Indiana University Press |isbn=978-0-253-01701-7 |page=30 |language=en |access-date=24 October 2020 |archive-date=17 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220217062314/https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZB2CgAAQBAJ&q=accra+nkran&pg=PA30 |url-status=live }}</ref>

== History ==
{{For timeline}}

[[File:Christiansborg Castle2.jpg|thumb|left|A contemporary drawing of the [[Danish overseas colonies|Danish empire]] fort, ''Fort Christiansborg'', now Osu Castle. The outpost to the right is ''Fort Prøvestenen'']]

The main [[Ga people|Ga]] group known as the Tumgwa Were led by Ayi Kushie arrived by sea. When the Guan ([[Larteh]]s) on the coast saw them on their canoes at sea, they looked like ants. Hence, the Lartehs refer to them as Nkran (ants). Nkran was later corrupted by the [[Danes]] to Akra, then to present-day Accra. ''Nkran'' in the [[Ga language]] is ''Gaga'', thus they also started calling themselves Ga. Due to the sheer numbers of the Ga immigrants, the indigenous Lartehs relocated to the [[Larteh Akuapem|Akuapem]] ridge.

Initially, Accra was not the most prominent trading centre; the trade hubs of the time were the ports at [[Ada, Ghana|Ada]] and [[Prampram]], along with the inland centres of [[Dodowa]] and [[Akuse]]. The Dutch built the nearby outposts of [[Ussher Fort]] while the British and the Swedes built James Fort and Christiansborg castles, respectively. By the 17th century, Portugal, [[France]] and Denmark, had constructed forts in the city.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

Britain gradually acquired the interests of all other countries beginning in 1851, when Denmark sold [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] (which they had acquired from the Swedes) and their other forts to the British. The [[Netherlands]] was the last to sell out, in 1871. In 1873, after decades of tension between the British and [[Ashanti people|Ashantis]], the British captured [[Kumasi]], destroying portions of the city. The British then captured Accra in 1874, and in 1877, at the end of the second [[Anglo-Asante Wars|Anglo-Asante War]], Accra replaced [[Cape Coast]] as the capital of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]]. This decision was made because Accra had a drier climate relative to Cape Coast. Until this time, the settlement of Accra was confined between Ussher Fort to the east and the [[Korle Lagoon]] to the west.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=994 |title=History of Accra |access-date=22 July 2010 |publisher=The African Executive |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707101722/http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=994 |archive-date=7 July 2011}}</ref>

As the newly established Gold Coast's administrative functions were moved to Accra (1877), an influx of British colonial administrators and European settlers grew around the Christiansborg (modern [[Osu, Accra|Osu]], Ministries, Ridge, Labone, and Cantonments) began, and the city began to expand to accommodate the new residents. Victoriaborg was formed in the late 19th century as an exclusively European residential neighbourhood, located to the east of the city limits of the time. The boundaries of Accra were further stretched in 1908. This expansion entailed the creation of a native-only neighbourhood, intended to accommodate members of the native population as a means of relieving congestion problems in the overcrowded city centre. [[Adabraka]] was thus established to the north of the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog261/eskidmore/history.htm |title=History of Accra |access-date=17 February 2011 |archive-date=31 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531013544/http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog261/eskidmore/history.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:HauptstraßeAccra18851908 300dpi.jpg|thumb|right|A main street of central Accra sometime between 1885 and 1908]]

One of the most influential decisions in the history of the city was that of building the Accra-Kumasi railway in 1908. This was to connect Accra, the country's foremost port at that time, with Ghana's main [[cocoa bean|cocoa]]-producing regions. In 1923, the railway was completed, and by 1924, cocoa was Ghana's largest export.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

The colonial era heavily influenced the shape that Accra took during this period. For example, the [[racial segregation|segregation]] of European and African neighbourhoods was mandated by law until 1923, and all new buildings were required to be built out of stone or concrete.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}} Despite these regulations, European settlers in the Gold Coast were very hesitant to invest any large amount of money into the city to maintain its infrastructure or improve public works. This did not change until the governorship of [[Gordon Guggisberg|Sir Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]] during which period the three separate settlements (Osu, La and Jamestown) merged to become modern Accra. Guggisberg's administration laid out the present grid networked neighbourhoods of Tudu, Adabraka and Asylum Down.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Among the achievements of Guggisberg was the building of a bridge across the Korle Lagoon in 1923, which opened the land west of the lagoon for settlement. Guggisberg also oversaw the building of a major hospital (Korle-Bu) and secondary school (Achimota). Such improvements led to an increase in Accra's population due to the [[rural-urban migration|migration of rural dwellers]] into the city, and the immigration of increasing numbers of British businessmen and administrators.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

=== After World War II ===
[[File:Jamestown lighthouse.jpg|thumb|upright|{{center|[[Jamestown Lighthouse]] in [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Jamestown/Usshertown]]}}]]
In the years following [[World War II]], the neighbourhoods of Ridge and Cantonments were planned as low-density developments for Europeans, while many rural migrants settled in neighbourhoods which had not yet been incorporated into Accra's municipal boundary, such as Nima and surrounding areas.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}} Thus, the development of these neighbourhoods was unregulated by the government, creating a crowded and jumbled [[shanty-town]] landscape.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

Another area of Accra that took shape at this time was the central business district (CBD). More administrative buildings were built on High Street, forming a massive judicial/administrative complex. Additionally, the expansion of the economy led to many more commercial buildings being built in the CBD.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In 1944, Accra's city planner Maxwell Fry devised a town plan, which was revised in 1958 by B.D.W. Treavallion and Alan Flood. Although the Fry/Trevallion plan was never followed through, it illustrated the British vision of how Accra should develop.{{citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In 1948, Ghana remained a colony of Great Britain following World War II. The chief of Osu Alata, Nii Kobina Bonney III, had set up a boycott of European goods across the country due to the rise of prices for essential commodities.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nyadzi |first1=Ralph |title=The Causes and Effects of the 1948 Accra Riots in Ghana |url=https://www.cegastacademy.com/2019/04/22/the-causes-and-effects-of-the-1948-accra-riots-in-ghana/ |website=Cegast Academy |date=22 April 2019 |access-date=2 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230508095747/https://www.cegastacademy.com/2019/04/22/the-causes-and-effects-of-the-1948-accra-riots-in-ghana/ |archive-date=8 May 2023 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref> At the same time, veterans of the war were fighting for their benefits and promised pay.<ref>{{cite web |last1=PRAAD |title=The Riots of 28th February 1948 |url=https://praad.gov.gh/index.php/the-riots-of-28th-february-1948/ |website=Public Records and Archives AdministrationDepartment |publisher=Marichael Company Limited |access-date=2 October 2023}}</ref> Unarmed ex-servicemen organized a march on [[Christiansborg Castle]], Accra, on 28 February 1948. Their plan was to hand a petition to the colonial governor demanding they receive their pay and benefits. Before reaching the castle, the veterans were fired upon, after being ordered by the colonial police chief to disperse. Three of the leaders of the demonstration were killed, including [[Sergeant Nii Adjetey]], who now has a memorial in Accra,{{citation needed|date=December 2023}} leading to the [[1948 Accra riots]].

==== Fry/Treavallion plan ====
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}
In the Fry/Treavallion plan, a reorganization of the CBD was called for, as well as the development of the coastal region of the city. To reorganize the CBD, the planners decided to superimpose a tight street grid north of Fort Ussher.

To the east of this newly organized CBD, the planners hoped to preserve a broad, open space for a restaurant, country club, and [[polo]] and [[cricket]] fields. Additionally, the British planners intended to build large numbers of public squares, fountains, and ornamental pools and statues throughout the city, as well as a vast Parliament Complex in the city centre. Lastly, the Fry/Treavallion plan included plans to make the coastal region an extension of the exclusive European neighbourhood of Victoriaborg, and to create a recreational preserve for the elite. However, the [[1948 Accra riots|British Gold Coast ended]] before the Fry/Treavallion plan was enacted.

==== Nkrumah Plan ====
[[File:Black Star Square and Independence Arch, Accra, Ghana.jpg|thumb|[[Black Star Square]]]]

When [[Kwame Nkrumah]] became Ghana's first post-independence [[Prime Minister of Ghana|Prime Minister]] in 1957, he created his own plan for Accra's development.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 5.</ref> Instead of creating spaces to serve the elite, Nkrumah sought to create spaces to inspire pride and nationalism in his people and people throughout Africa.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Rather than creating ornamental fountains and a large Parliament complex, Nkrumah decided to build landmarks such as Independence Square, the State House, and the Organisation of African Unity building, and to refurbish Christianborg Castle. Nkrumah decided to leave the Atlantic coastal region undeveloped, so as to not detract attention from the Community Centre or Independence Square, lending both spaces symbolic significance.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}} The Nkrumah plan did not emphasise order nearly as much as the Fry/Treavallion plan did; whereas the British plan strove to lessen crowding in the commercial district and help relieve the overcrowding of neighbourhoods bordering the CBD, the Nkrumah plan allowed for continued compression of commercial establishments into the CBD, as well as increased migration into Jamestown.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

The modern city is centred on the original British, Danish, and Dutch forts and their surrounding communities: [[Jamestown, Ghana|Jamestown]] near the British [[Fort James, Ghana|James Fort]], [[Osu, Accra|Osu]] near the Danish fort of [[Fort Christiansborg|Christiansborg]] (now [[Osu Castle]]), and [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Ussherstown]] near the Dutch [[Ussher fort]].

Tourist attractions include the [[National Museum of Ghana]], the [[Ghana Academy of Arts and Sciences]], the [[National Archives of Ghana]] and Ghana's central library, the [[National Theatre of Ghana|National Theatre]], the Accra Centre for National Culture, and [[Jamestown Lighthouse]].

The [[Parliament of Ghana|Parliament]], [[Supreme Court of Ghana]], [[Black Star Square]] and the [[Bank of Ghana]] are also located in Accra.

The city is also a transportation hub, home to the [[Kotoka International Airport]], and railway links to [[Tema]], [[Sekondi-Takoradi]] and [[Kumasi]]. Accra has become a location for national and international business conferences, such as the BarCamp Ghana series, organised by GhanaThink Foundation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.allconferences.com/Regional/Accra/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017232231/http://www.allconferences.com/Regional/Accra/|url-status=dead|title=Accra Conferences|archivedate=17 October 2011}}</ref>

Owing to its location in the [[Dahomey Gap]], where the Gulf of Guinea and the Atlantic Ocean coast runs parallel to the prevailing moist monsoonal winds, Accra features a very marginal [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Aw''') that borders on a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''BSh'''). The average annual rainfall is about 730&nbsp;mm, which falls primarily during Ghana's two rainy seasons. The chief rainy season begins in April and ends in mid-July, whilst a weaker second rainy season occurs in October. Rain usually falls in short intensive storms and causes local flooding in which drainage channels are obstructed.

Very little variation in temperature occurs throughout the year. The mean monthly temperature ranges from {{convert|25.9|°C|°F|1}} in August (the coolest) to {{convert|29.6|°C|°F|1}} in March (the hottest), with an annual average of {{convert|27.6|°C|°F|1}}. The "cooler" months, which are summer months tend to be more [[humid]] than the warmer months, which are winter and spring months. As a result, during the warmer months and particularly during the windy [[harmattan]] season, the city experiences a breezy "dry heat" that feels less warm than the "cooler" but more humid rainy season.

As a coastal city, Accra is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change and sea level rise, with population growth putting increasing pressure on the coastal areas.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FCFA_PolicyBrief_Accra-Maputo_WEB1.pdf Using climate information to achieve long-term development objectives in coastal Ghana and Mozambique] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318210759/http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/FCFA_PolicyBrief_Accra-Maputo_WEB1.pdf |date=18 March 2015 }}. [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]]. Retrieved 16 April 2015</ref> Drainage infrastructure is particularly at risk, which has profound implications for people's livelihoods, especially in informal settlements. Inadequate planning regulation and law enforcement, as well as perceived corruption in government processes, lack of communication across government departments and lack of concern or government co-ordination with respect to building codes are major impediments to progressing the development of Accra's drainage infrastructure, according to the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]].<ref>[http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/  Future Climate for Africa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415220758/http://cdkn.org/future-climate-africa/ |date=15 April 2015 }}. [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]]. Retrieved 16 April 2015</ref>

As Accra is close to the [[equator]], the daylight hours are practically uniform during the year. Relative humidity is generally high, varying from 65% in the midafternoon to 95% at night. The predominant wind direction in Accra is from the WSW to NNE sectors. Wind speeds normally range between 8 and 16&nbsp;km/h. High wind gusts occur with [[thunderstorm]]s, which generally pass in [[squalls]] along the coast.

The maximum wind speed record in Accra is 107.4&nbsp;km/h (58 knots). Strong winds associated with thunderstorm activity often cause damage to property by removing roofing material. Several areas of Accra experience microclimatic effects. Low-profile [[drainage basin]]s with a north–south orientation are not as well ventilated as those oriented east–west.

Air is often trapped in pockets over the city, and an insulation effect can give rise to a local increase in air temperature of several degrees. This occurs most notably in the Accra Newtown sports complex areas.

The former territory of the Accra Metropolitan District, {{cvt|199.4|km2}},<ref name=land_area /> as it existed before 2008, is now divided into 13 separate local government districts, all governed as municipal assemblies with their own town hall and a municipal executive appointed by the president of the republic. Each municipal assembly is responsible for most local services, such as local planning and refuse collection. The reduced [[Accra Metropolitan District]] (also referred to as City of Accra), {{cvt|20.4|km2}}, once comprised the entirety of Accra until the Ledzokuku, Krowor, La Dadekotopon, Ablekuma North, Ablekuma Central, Ablekuma West, Ayawaso East, Ayawaso North, Ayawaso Central, Ayawaso West, Okaikwei North, and Korley Kottey districts were carved out as separate municipal districts between 2008 and 2019.

=== Accra Central ===
The Ring Road, extending from the Korle Lagoon in the west, north to Kwame Nkrumah Circle, following east to the juncture of Independence Avenue, and continuing on to [[Osu, Accra|Osu]], forms a ring around the oldest districts of Accra, and separates central Accra from the outlying suburbs.

Central Accra includes the CBD, which consists of the historic districts of [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Usshertown]], Tudu, [[Victoriaborg, Accra|Victoriaborg]], [[West Ridge, Accra|West Ridge]], and [[East Ridge, Accra|East Ridge]], as well as the historic residential districts of [[Jamestown/Usshertown, Accra|Jamestown]], [[Adabraka]], Asylum Down, [[North Ridge, Accra|North Ridge]] and [[Osu, Accra|Christiansborg/Osu]].

Although satellite business districts such as the Airport City have been established across the city, Central Accra remains the administrative and cultural centre of Accra, hosting government ministries, hotels, businesses, and financial institutions.

Central Accra's principal attractions include the [[Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum]], the [[National Museum of Ghana|National Museum]], [[Independence Arch (Accra)|Independence Square]], the [[National Theatre (Accra)|National Theatre]], and the [[Ohene Djan Stadium]].

=== Accra North ===
Northern Accra is a residential and business district. The area contains the "37" Military Hospital, [[The Flagstaff House]], several foreign [[embassy|embassies]], [[Achimota School]], Achimota Golf Park, and the [[University of Ghana]]'s Legon campus, which serves as Accra's northern boundary.

Geographically, the areas north of Ring Road West and Central, east of Winneba/Graphic Road, west of Liberation Road, and the districts just north and south of the Kwame Nkrumah motorway are regarded as Northern Accra. Some areas North of Accra include, Ashongnman, Madina, Haatso, North and West Legon and others.

=== Accra East ===
Eastern Accra is largely residential and geographically north of Ring Road East, stretching as far north as Kwame Nkrumah Motorway; the district is bordered to the west by Liberation Road.

=== Accra West ===
Western Accra is largely a residential and business area. Whilst geographically less expansive than the northern and eastern reaches of the city as a result of the large saltponds of Tettegu and Aplaku, it nonetheless boasts one of Accra's most important landmarks, the [[Korle Bu Teaching Hospital]].

Geographically, the areas west of Ring Road West, extending as far west as the saltponds and south of Graphic Road, are considered Accra West.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&rlv=climate |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |access-date=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711091832/http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&rlv=climate |archive-date=11 July 2011}}</ref>

== Demographics ==
The period between 1960 and 1970 saw rapid industrialization and expansion in Accra's manufacturing and commercial sectors. This contributed to high [[rural-urban migration]] to the city, and consequently a high population growth rate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3004 |title=A repository of all districts in the republic of Ghana |publisher=Ghana Districts |access-date=5 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711091853/http://ghanadistricts.com/districts/?r=1&_=3&sa=3004 |archive-date=11 July 2011}}</ref> The stagnation of the Ghanaian economy during the 1970s slowed the growth of Accra's population, as shown by the falling growth rate of the 1970–1984 intercensal years. Later, however, the decline in agriculture in rural communities in Ghana and rising industrialization in urban regions, coupled with the late-1980s boom in the [[service sector]], once again propelled immigration to Accra. The primacy of the Accra Metropolitan Area as the Greater Accra region's administrative, educational, industrial and commercial centre continues to be the major force for its population growth, with immigration contributing to over 35% of the Accra's population growth.

=== Distribution and density ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}
The gross density of population for the Accra Metropolitan Area in 2000 was 10.03 persons per hectare, compared to 6.23 per hectare in 1970. The highest densities were recorded in the Accra Metropolitan Assembly, with an overall average of 69.3 persons per hectare. At the community level, densities exceeding 250 persons per hectare occurred mostly in the immigrant and depressed areas in the oldest parts of Accra, such as Accra New Town, Nima, Jamestown and Usshertown. In higher-income areas, densities ranged between 17.5 and 40 persons per hectare.

=== Population distribution by age and gender ===
Accra's population is a very youthful one, with 56% of the population being under 24 years of age. This predominance of young people is not expected to decline in the foreseeable future. Fifty-one percent (51%) of the population are females, and the remaining 49% males. This gives a males-to-females ratio of 1:1.04. The greater number of females is a reflection of the nationwide trend, where the estimated ratio of males to females is 1:1.03.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mba|first=Chuks J.|date=29 September 2010|title=Population Ageing in Ghana: Research Gaps and the Way Forward|journal=Journal of Aging Research|volume=2010|page=672157|doi=10.4061/2010/672157 |doi-access=free|issn=2090-2204|pmc=3003962|pmid=21188229}}</ref>

=== Migration ===
Decentralization is expected to reduce the migration rates in Accra. An assessment of the extent of migration to Accra, based on present locality and gender, reveals that 45% of residents in Accra are African immigrants from countries across the African continent.

=== Housing ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2024}}
Parts of Central Accra comprise a mixture of very low-density development with under-used service infrastructure on the one hand, high-density development and overstretched infrastructure services on the other. The growth of Accra has led to the neglect of some of the old settlements, whilst efforts are being made to provide the newly developing suburban areas with services and infrastructure to cater for the needs of the middle-income earners. Peripheral residential development in Accra barely has sufficient infrastructure to support it. There are also large numbers of uncompleted houses, interspersed with pockets of undeveloped land, which are often subject of litigation, due to the inability of organisations and individuals who own them to complete or develop them due to lack of funds. Housing can be grouped into three broad categories: the low-income, middle-income and high-income areas. The low-income housing areas comprise Osu, Jamestown, Adedenkpo, Chorkor, La, Teshie, Nungua, Sukura, Kwashieman, Odorkor, Bubiashie, Abeka, Nima, Maamobi and Chorkor. Altogether, these areas accommodate about 58% of Accra's total population. Most of Accra's informal businesses are located in low-income areas.

Almost all low-income areas are built up with little room for expansion. This is particularly so in the areas of the inner city. The middle-income areas of Accra are predominantly populated by Ghanaian citizens and business, administrative and professional families. Much of the housing in these areas has been provided by state, parastatal and [[private sector]] organisations and individuals. The middle-income areas include Dansoman Estates, North Kaneshie Estates, Asylum Down, Kanda Estates, Abelempke, Achimota, Adenta and Tesano. Usually, these areas, unlike the low-income areas, are planned developments, but are in need of infrastructure services. Building materials and general housing conditions are of better quality. The middle-income group comprises 32% of the city's population of which are Ghanaian citizens make up. The high-income areas provide housing for the remaining 10% of the population of which Ghanaian citizens also make up. They include areas like North Ridge and West Ridge, Ringway Estates, north Labone Estates, Airport Residential Area, Roman Ridge, East Legon.

These areas are all planned and have well developed infrastructure with spacious and landscaped ground in sharp contrast with, particularly, the low-income areas. Buildings are usually built with [[sandcrete]] blocks, and have walls and roofed with aluminium, or [[asbestos]] roofing sheets. There are also high-income peripheral areas like Haatso, Kwabenya, Pokuase, Adenta, Taifa, Mallam, where development of engineering infrastructure is not yet complete. These areas developed ahead of infrastructure, however the Achimota-Ofankor [[controlled-access highway]] was scheduled to open in May 2012,{{Update inline|date=December 2014}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.modernghana.com/news/383369/achimota-ofankor-road-to-open-to-traffic-in-may.html |title=Achimota-Ofankor Road To Open To Traffic in May |work=graphic.com.gh |publisher=[[Daily Graphic (Ghana)|Daily Graphic]] |date=14 March 2012 |access-date=22 April 2016 |via=Modern Ghana |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160512234613/https://www.modernghana.com/news/383369/achimota-ofankor-road-to-open-to-traffic-in-may.html |archive-date=12 May 2016  }}and the Awoshie-Pokuase</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/Ghana-Awoshie-Pokuase%20Road%20ESIA%20Summary%20board%20board%2020%201%2009.pdf |title=Ghana: Awoshie-Pokuase Road Projet |publisher=afdb.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130723071937/http://www.afdb.org/fileadmin/uploads/afdb/Documents/Environmental-and-Social-Assessments/Ghana-Awoshie-Pokuase%20Road%20ESIA%20Summary%20board%20board%2020%201%2009.pdf |archive-date=23 July 2013}}</ref> [[dual carriageway]] [[road construction]] was also due to be completed in 2012.{{Update inline|date=December 2014}} In total, 84.4% of all houses in the Accra Metropolitan Area have their outside walls made up of cement.

=== Sectors of the economy ===
[[File:PricewaterhouseCoopers and Eni Buildings (Accra, Ghana).jpg|thumb|left|PricewaterhouseCoopers building, Accra]]
The sectors of Accra's economy consist of the primary, secondary (manufacturing, electricity, gas, water, construction) and tertiary sectors (supermarkets, shopping malls, hotel, restaurant, transportation, storage, communication, financial intermediation, real estate service, public administration, education, health and other social services). The tertiary service sector is the city's largest, employing about 531,670 people. The second-largest, the secondary sector, employs 22.34% of the labour force, or around 183,934 people. 12.2% of the city's workforce are reportedly unemployed, totalling around 114,198 people.<ref name="ghanadistricts1" />
{{Further|topic=the technology company|Asoriba}}

=== Primary sector ===
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2024}}
[[File:Overzicht baai met boten in de zee - Accra - 20375372 - RCE.jpg|thumb|Licensed and Commercial [[fishing vessel]]s off the [[coast]] of Accra.]]
Accra's smallest economic sector, the primary sector, employs approximately 91,556 people. The predominant economic activities are [[fishery]] and [[urban agriculture]], with fishery accounting for 78% of production labour. Urban agriculture in Accra centres on the growth of vegetables, several crops and poultry. The fishery industry is the most important sub-sector, with 10% of the catch being exported and the rest consumed locally. The industry is characterised by extreme seasonableness, operating primarily between June and September. Although most deep-water Atlantic fishing around Accra takes place in the June–September period, fishery operations take place close to the shore throughout the year, and there are clear indications of the [[overfishing|depletion of fish stocks]] in the near future. Fishing operations are most prominent at the Jamestown, La, Teshie, Nungua and Chorkor fishing shores.

== Education ==
=== Pre-school ===
Pre-school comprises nursery and kindergarten. In 2001, there were 7,923 children (3,893 girls and 4,030 boys) in [[pre-school]]s in Accra. In 2010, the enrolment rate at Pre-school was 98%.<ref name="UNICEF at a glance: Ghana&nbsp;– Statistics">{{cite web |url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/ghana_statistics.html |title=UNICEF at a glance: Ghana&nbsp;– Statistics |work=unicef.org |publisher=[[UNICEF]] |access-date=5 April 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403110008/http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/ghana_statistics.html |archive-date=3 April 2012}}</ref> Pre-schools are regulated by the Ministry of Employment and Social Welfare, and are mostly privately owned and operated. In 2001, there were 62 government-owned pre-schools in the Accra metropolis.

=== Primary school ===
Primary school enrolment of girls is higher than that of boys.<ref name="UNICEF at a glance: Ghana&nbsp;– Statistics"/> In 2010, the enrollment rate at primary school level was 95%.<ref name="UNICEF at a glance: Ghana&nbsp;– Statistics"/>

=== Junior high school (JHS) ===
The Junior High School is part of Ghana's basic education program. Its nationwide implementation began on 29 September 1987.

In the 2001/2002 academic year, 61,080 pupils had enrolled in Accra, representing 57.17% of the 129,467 school-age 12–to-14-year-olds. In 2010, the enrolment rate at Junior high school level was 95%.<ref name="UNICEF at a glance: Ghana&nbsp;– Statistics"/> The ratio of girls is also higher at this level.<ref name="UNICEF at a glance: Ghana&nbsp;– Statistics"/>

Accra is on the Atlantic coast but it has not served as a port city since the 1950s. Instead, the Port of [[Tema]], about 29&nbsp;km to the east along the Atlantic coast, was developed for deepwater shipping to and from Ghana as it can accommodate larger ships; the port opened in 1961.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cogoport.com/ports/tema-ghtem |title=Tema (GHTEM), Ghana |access-date=5 December 2021 |date= |work=Cogoport |archive-date=6 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206011912/https://www.cogoport.com/ports/tema-ghtem |url-status=live }}</ref> Tema is part of the metropolitan area of Accra.

Transport within Accra includes roads and rails, and an international airport

=== Rapid transit ===
Public transports exist between Accra and major cities such as [[Kumasi]]; [[Tamale, Ghana|Tamale]], [[Mim, Ahafo]]; [[Cape Coast]], [[Sunyani]]; [[Takoradi]]; [[Tema]]; [[Ho, Ghana|Ho]]; [[Wa, Ghana|Wa]]; [[Bolgatanga]]; [[Elubo]]; [[Aflao]], [[Techiman]];

In 2003, the [[Metro mass Transit L.T.D|Metro Mass Transit Service]], was inaugurated in Accra as a more comfortable and cheaper alternative to the trotro.

Accra is served by the [[Aayalolo]] bus system, which was inaugurated in November 2016. It was initially planned as a [[bus rapid transit]] with dedicated lanes, but because these lanes were not provided it was renamed [[Quality Bus Corridor|Quality Bus System]] (QBS).

An agreement was signed in 2019 to build a five line, {{convert|194|km|mi|abbr=on}}, automated, elevated light railway metro system called [[Accra Skytrain]]. As of 2021 construction has not commenced on the $2.6 billion project. The government said in February 2021 it intends to proceed with the project which will developed under a [[build-own-operate]] concession by private South African firm.

Accra is connected by railway line to [[Kumasi]] and [[Takoradi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uktradeinvest.gov.uk/ukti/appmanager/ukti/countries;jsessionid=KTBQpDl6Xp1jtjp4NLphhKn0cT23s7p5jtpJ3DnkJcy1PSjz0Zds!89531318!NONE?_nfpb=true&portlet_3_5_actionOverride=/pub/portlets/genericViewer/showContentItem&_windowLabel=portlet_3_5&portlet_3_5navigationPageId=/ghana&portlet_3_5navigationContentPath=/BEA+Repository/326/226985&_pageLabel=CountryType1 |title=Ghana |publisher=UK Trade and Investment |date=28 April 2009 |access-date=29 October 2009}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>
There is a suburban railway line from [[Accra Central Station]] to [[Tema]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Accra-Tema Railway Line |website=railway-technology.com |publisher=Kable Intelligence |date=c. 2010 |url=http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/accratemarailwayline/ |access-date=23 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171223043814/http://www.railway-technology.com/projects/accratemarailwayline/ |archive-date=23 December 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Aviation ===
Accra is served by [[Kotoka International Airport]], which has both civil and military uses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldaerodata.com/wad.cgi?id=GH02526&sch=DGAA |title=Kotoka International Airport |publisher=World Aero Data |year=2009 |access-date=29 October 2009 |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080612190720/http://worldaerodata.com/wad.cgi?id=GH02526&sch=dgaa |archive-date=12 June 2008 }}</ref> Located {{convert|6|mi|km|abbr=off}} from downtown Accra, the airport handles all of the city's [[scheduled air transport|scheduled passenger services]]. There are plans to build a second airport to relieve the aviation pressure on the Kotoka International Airport. This new airport will be located at Prampram in Accra and will be constructed by China Airport Civil Construction. This plan was still under review in 2020, as additional runways at Kotoka are in consideration as an alternative to a new international airport.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://thebftonline.com/2020/08/26/prampram-airport-still-on-govts-mind-kofi-adda-expanding-kotoka-also-another-option/ |title=Prampram Airport still on gov't's mind&nbsp;– Kofi Adda ... expanding Kotoka also another option |date=26 August 2020 |work=The [[Business & Financial Times]] |location=Accra, Ghana |access-date=5 December 2021 |archive-date=17 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220217062420/https://thebftonline.com/2020/08/26/prampram-airport-still-on-govts-mind-kofi-adda-expanding-kotoka-also-another-option/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Taxis ===
[[File:High Street, Accra.jpg|thumb|Taxis on Accra's High Street]]

Accra has an extensive [[taxicab|taxi]] network and numerous [[taxi rank]]s, but most taxis lack a meter system, so price negotiation is required between the passenger and driver. Metered taxis do operate in the city, but tend to be more expensive. Taxis in Ghana are painted in two colours: the four bumpers [[fender (vehicle)|fenders]] are yellow/orange, and the rest of the car is in a colour of the operator's choice. These taxis usually function on a shared ride model, where several passengers share one vehicle and the fare is calculated based on the distance traveled. Recently, modern taxi services such as [[Uber]], [[Taxify]], and [https://yango.com/en_gh/ Yango] have joined the market, providing a more advanced and comfortable alternative. Some taxi drivers might charge extra for luggage or late-night trips while some also offer fixed prices and allow for advance bookings, offering a more reliable and secure option.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Taxi, Trotro Drivers |url=https://www.graphic.com.gh/features/features/taxi-trotro-drivers-invaluable-assets-in-the-transport-sector.html}}</ref>

=== Tro tros and buses ===
{{further|Tro tro|Metro Mass Transit Company Limited}}

By far the most common form of transport in Accra, ''[[tro tro]]s'' (minibuses or cargo vans modified for passenger transport) is the third biggest, and second most efficient and cost-effective way of getting around the city. The buses are typically minibuses or vans. Some of the most popular models used as tro tros are Nissan Urvan 15-seaters and Mercedes Benz Sprinter or D 309 vans. Trotros are typically decorated with decals such as flags of various countries or (local and international) soccer teams, popular sayings, proverbs (in English or local languages) or Bible verses. Trotros pick up and offload passengers at designated bus stops along their regular routes. Tro tros will also usually offload at undesignated locations along the route, by passenger request. Most routes commence and terminate at large urban transport terminals such as the Neoplan station or the [[Achimota Transport Terminal]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://beautifulghana.com/content/view/41/82/lang,en/ |title=Transportation &#124; Ghana, Accra, Transport, Car, Trotros |publisher=Beautiful Ghana |date=1 May 2006 |access-date=5 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621083850/http://www.beautifulghana.com/content/view/41/82/lang%2Cen/ |archive-date=21 June 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
