== History ==
{{main|Chittor Fort}}
Originally called Chitrakuta, the Chittor Fort is said to have been built by [[Chitrangada Mori|Chitranga]], a mori king.{{sfn|Paul E. Schellinger|Robert M. Salkin|1994|p=191}}{{sfn|Shiv Kumar Tiwari|2002|p=271}}

The [[Guhilas of Medapata|Guhila]] (Gahlot) ruler [[Bappa Rawal]] is said to have captured the fort in either 728 CE or 734 CE.{{sfn|Paul E. Schellinger|Robert M. Salkin|1994|p=191}} However, some historians doubt the historicity of this legend, arguing that the Guhilas did not control Chittor before the reign of the later ruler [[Allata]].{{sfn|Ram Vallabh Somani|1976|p=44}}

Chittor was known as " Chit-[[Ror]] " at that time . Between 1251 and 1258, [[Balban]] repeatedly led troops to Chitror fort .<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=75FlxDhZWpwC&dq=chitror&pg=PA230 Al-Hind the Making of the Indo-Islamic World, p. 230]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=uQ7k2vQlYxEC&dq=chitror&pg=PA230 Al-Hind The Making of the Indo-Islamic World · Volume 1, p. 230]</ref> Under the orders of [[Alauddin Khilji]], [[Ulugh Khan]] laid a siege in the direction of [[Ranthambore Fort|Ranthambore]], Chitror and [[Bundi]] forts.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=icgNAAAAQAAJ&dq=chitror&pg=PA370 The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians, p. 370]</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=J7vXAAAAMAAJ Tabakat-i-Nasiri, p. 124]</ref>

In 1303, the [[Delhi Sultanate]] ruler [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] defeated the Guhila king [[Ratnasimha]], and [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1303)|captured the fort]].{{sfn|Banarsi Prasad Saksena|1992|p=366}} The fort was later captured by [[Maharana Hammir|Hammir Singh]], a king of the [[Sisodia Dynasty|Sisodia]] branch of the Guhilas. Chittor gained prominence during the period of his successors, which included [[Rana Kumbha]] and [[Rana Sanga]]. In 1535, [[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]] [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1535)|besieged and conquered]] the fort. However Bahadur Shah was not able to hold Chittor for long and the Sisodia's captured it within a short time of his departure.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hooja |first=Rima |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tosMAQAAMAAJ&q=Rumi+khan |title=A History of Rajasthan |date=2006 |publisher=Rupa & Company |isbn=978-81-291-0890-6 |pages=457–460 |language=en}}</ref>
