'''Volos''' ({{langx|el|Βόλος}} {{IPA-el|ˈvolos|}}) is a coastal [[port]] [[city]] in [[Thessaly]] situated midway on the Greek mainland, about {{convert|330|km|0|abbr=off}} north of [[Athens]] and {{convert|220|km|0|abbr=off}} south of [[Thessaloniki]]. It is the capital of the [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] regional unit of the Thessaly Region. Volos is also the only outlet to the sea from Thessaly, the country's largest agricultural region. With a population of 85,803 (2021),<ref name=census21/> the city is an important industrial centre, and its port provides a bridge between Europe and Asia.

Volos is the newest of the Greek port cities, with a large proportion of modern buildings erected following catastrophic earthquakes in 1955. It includes the [[municipality|municipal units]] of Volos, [[Nea Ionia (Magnesia), Greece|Nea Ionia]] and [[Iolkos]], as well as smaller [[suburban]] communities. The economy of the city is based on manufacturing, trade, services and tourism. Home to the [[University of Thessaly]], the city also offers facilities for conferences, exhibitions and major sporting, cultural and scientific events. Volos participated in the [[2004 Olympic Games]], and the city has since played host to other athletic events, such as the [[European Athletic Championships]]. Volos hosted the 7th [[International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics]] from 27 July to 5 August 2013.<ref>http://www.ioaa2013.gr/ 7th International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics official website</ref>

== Location ==
Built at the innermost point of the [[Pagasetic Gulf]] and at the foot of Mount Pilio ([[Pelion]], the land of the [[Centaurs]]). The city spreads in the plain on the foothills of Mount Pelion, bordering the town of [[Agria]] to the east and [[Nea Anchialos]] to the southwest. Volos' municipality includes both towns, along with many nearby villages, including [[Makrinitsa]] and [[Portaria]].

Volos is a major commercial port of mainland Greece in the Aegean sea (after Piraeus and Thessaloniki), with connection by ferry and hydrofoil to the nearby [[Sporades]] Islands, which include [[Skiathos]], [[Skopelos]] and [[Alonissos]]. There are also connections to [[Lemnos]], [[Lesbos]], [[Chios]] and [[Skyros]].

Modern Volos is built on the area of the ancient cities of [[Demetrias]], [[Pagasae]] and [[Iolcos]]. Demetrias was established in 293 BC by [[Demetrius Poliorcetes]], King of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedon]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Helly |first=Bruno |editor-last=Hornblower |editor-first=Simon |encyclopedia= The Oxford Classical Dictionary |title= Demetrias | url= https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199545568.001.0001/acref-9780199545568-e-2087 |access-date=11 June 2020 |edition=4th |year=2012 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 9780191735257 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780199545568.001.0001}}</ref> [[Iolcus]], or Iolkos, was known in mythology as the homeland of the hero [[Jason]], who boarded the ship [[Argo]] accompanied by the [[Argonauts]] and sailed in quest of the [[Golden Fleece]] to [[Colchis]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Hunter |first=R. |editor-last=Hornblower |editor-first=Simon |encyclopedia= The Oxford Classical Dictionary |title= Jason | url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199545568.001.0001/acref-9780199545568-e-3483 |access-date=11 June 2020 |edition=4th |year=2012 |publisher= Oxford University Press |isbn= 9780191735257 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780199545568.001.0001}}</ref> To the west of Volos lie the [[Neolithic]] settlements of [[Dimini]], with a ruined [[acropolis]], walls, and two beehive tombs dating to between 4000 and 1200 BC, and [[Sesklo]], with the remains of the oldest acropolis in Greece (6000 BC).

===Byzantine era===
{{Further|Byzantine Greece}}
Iolcus is still attested in the early Byzantine period but was eclipsed for most of the [[Middle Ages]] by Demetrias.<ref name="TIB165">{{Tabula Imperii Byzantini | volume = 1 | page = 165}}</ref> The [[Slavs|Slavic]] tribe of the [[Belegezites]] settled in the area during the 7th century.<ref name="TIB56">{{Tabula Imperii Byzantini | volume = 1 | page = 56}}</ref>

Volos first appears again in 1333, as one of the cities captured by the Byzantine general [[John Monomachos]] in Thessaly, under the name "Golos" (Γόλος).<ref name="TIB165"/> The name is of Slavic origin, from ''golo'', ''golъ'', "barren".<ref name="Hatzidakis">{{cite journal | last = Hatzidakis | first = G.

The walls of medieval Golos follow the traces of the fortifications of ancient Iolcus, and many remnants of the ancient city have been found in the medieval citadel.<ref name="TIB166">{{Tabula Imperii Byzantini | volume = 1 | page = 166}}</ref>

Along with the rest of Thessaly, Volos fell under [[Serbian Empire|Serbian]] rule in 1348, governed by [[Gregory Preljub]].<ref>{{cite book | last=Soulis | first=George C. | year=1984 | title=The Serbs and Byzantium during the reign of Emperor Stephen Dušan (1331–1355) and his successors | publisher=[[Dumbarton Oaks]] | isbn=0-88402-137-8 | pages=108–110}}</ref> After Preljub's death Thessaly passed under the brief rule of [[Nikephoros II Orsini]], followed by the Serbian rulers [[Simeon Uroš]] and [[John Uroš]]. After the latter's death in 1373, Thessaly returned under Byzantine rule for twenty years, until its conquest by the [[Ottoman Empire]] under Sultan [[Bayezid I]].<ref>{{Tabula Imperii Byzantini | volume = 1 | pages = 75–76}}</ref>

===Ottoman era===
{{Further|Ottoman Greece}}
[[File:VolanakisVolosHarbour.jpg|thumb|240px|''The port of Volos'' by [[Konstantinos Volanakis|Constantine Volanakis]] (c.1875).]]
Ottoman rule was not yet firm. The first period of Ottoman control lasted from 1393 to 1397, followed by another {{circa|1403}}, but it was not until 1423 that Volos was definitively incorporated into the Ottoman Empire.<ref name="EI2"/> The Ottoman name of the city was {{langx|ota|قلز|Quluz}}.<ref name="EI2"/> The Ottomans strengthened the town's fortifications against a possible [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] attack, and installed not only a garrison, but also Muslim settlers from [[Anatolia]].<ref name="EI2"/> The local Christian population in turn moved to the slopes of Pelion.<ref name="EI2"/> From this time on, Volos became the chief settlement on the Pagasetic Gulf.<ref name="TIB166"/>

The city began to spread outside its walls in the late 16th/early 17th centuries, coinciding with a growth in commerce, helped by the city's famed twice-weekly local fair and the first works at the waterfront harbour.<ref name="EI2"/> The fortress was captured by the Venetians under [[Francesco Morosini]] in 1665, during the [[Cretan War (1645–1669)|Cretan War]], but recovered and refortified by the Ottomans.<ref name="EI2"/>

In May 1821, at the beginning of the [[Greek Revolution]], the Greek rebels of Mount Pelion tried to capture the fortress but failed.<ref name="EI2"/> On 8 April 1827, the Greek fleet, under the command of the British [[philhellene]] [[Frank Abney Hastings]], captured five Ottoman ships in the city's harbour and forced the local garrison to evacuate the fortress.<ref name="EI2"/> The provisional government of Greece claimed Volos as part of Greek national territory, but the [[Treaty of Constantinople (1832)]], which established a Greek independent state, set its northern boundary along a line running south from [[Arta, Greece|Arta]] to Volos.<ref>{{cite book| first=John | last= Comstock| title= History of the Greek Revolution| url=https://archive.org/details/historyofgreekre00coms | location= New York |year= 1829|page=[https://archive.org/details/historyofgreekre00coms/page/n14 5]|publisher=W.

===Modern Volos===
[[File:Fotografi av Volos - Hallwylska museet - 103096.tif|thumb|center|1000px|Photo of 1896]]

After its incorporation into the [[Greek Kingdom]], the town had a population of only 4,900, but grew rapidly in the next four decades as merchants, businessmen, craftsmen and sailors gravitated toward it from the surrounding area. In the 1920s a large influx of refugees to the settlement took place, especially from [[Ionia]], but also from [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Cappadocia]] and Eastern [[Thrace]]. In 1882, [[Andreas Syngros]] established the [[Privileged Bank of Epirothessaly]], which the [[National Bank of Greece]] acquired in 1899 after its founder's death. Volos was occupied by Ottomans on 8 May 1897, during the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco Turkish War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Cathy Gere|title=Knossos and the Prophets of Modernism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ib1J04aDFB8C&pg=PA99|year=2010|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-28955-7|page=99}}</ref>

The city had a vibrant Jewish community in the early 20th century: from ≈500 in 1896, it rose to ≈2,000 in 1930, before falling drastically to 882 members in 1940, because of emigration to the great cities of Thessaloniki and [[Athens]] or abroad. During the [[Axis occupation of Greece]], the prompt actions of the local chief rabbi, [[Moshe Pessach]], and the Greek authorities saved about 700 of the local Jewish community from deportation to the Nazi death camps.<ref name="Enc">{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia = The Encyclopedia of Jewish Life Before and During the Holocaust, Volume 3: Seredina-Buda–Z | editor1=Shmuel Spector|editor2=Geoffrey Wigoder | publisher=New York University Press | location = New York| year = 2001 | isbn = 9780814793787 | title = Volos | pages = 1411–1412 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tumlOiOZvSUC&pg=PA1411}}</ref>

After an aerial attack by Italian troops in November 1940 and another by the Germans in 1941, many of the city's inhabitants took refuge in the villages of [[Pelion]]. Abandoning Volos after Italy's capitulation in September 1943, the Italians left storerooms full of food, arms and ammunition. Large quantities of this material was transported with the [[Pelion railway]] to the mountain village [[Milies]] and under the supervision of [[Greek People's Liberation Army|ELAS]] loaded onto [[mule]]s and taken to secure hideaways. When the Germans set off a column to Milies an officer and a soldier were killed by resistance fighters. In reprisal nearly the whole village was burnt down by German occupation troops on October 4, 1943. According to the official report of the municipality the Germans executed 25 men, and three inhabitants died in their houses from the flames.<ref>Helen F. Stamati: Milies: A Village on Mount Pelion, Athens 1989, p. 54–59.</ref>



Volos is also well known for its assortment of mezedes and a clear alcoholic beverage known as ''[[tsipouro]]''.

A street in a sister city, [[Rostov-on-Don]], bears the name ''Улица Греческого Города Волос'' (Street of the Greek City of Volos), weaving through a mix of early 20th-century buildings with characteristic inner yards, tiered balconies and open iron stairs that lend the old Rostov its characteristic Mediterranean look.

In September 2023 the city of Volos was flooded by massive rain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/av/world-europe-66721381 |title=Greece: Skiathos and Volos hit by flash floods |website=bbc.com  |date= |access-date=2023-09-06 |quote=The coastal port city of Volos has seen the same mount of water falling in 24 hours that it usually gets for the whole of autumn - according to local experts.}}</ref>

==Administration==
The municipality Volos was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following nine former municipalities, that became municipal units:<ref name=Kallikratis>{{Cite web|url=http://www.et.gr/idocs-nph/search/pdfViewerForm.html?args=5C7QrtC22wGYK2xFpSwMnXdtvSoClrL8-SrPzKAEPjjtIl9LGdkF53UIxsx942CdyqxSQYNuqAGCF0IfB9HI6hq6ZkZV96FIukI0UzcPsWCK0LpLhpa7rhiWB4R5ntTnoWw7U8E1Amg.|title=ΦΕΚ A 87/2010, Kallikratis reform law text|language=el|publisher=[[Government Gazette (Greece)|Government Gazette]]}}</ref>

===Province===
The province of Volos ({{langx|el|Επαρχία Βόλου}}) was one of the [[provinces of Greece|provinces]] of the Magnesia Prefecture. Its territory corresponded with that of the current municipalities Volos, [[Rigas Feraios (municipality)|Rigas Feraios]], [[South Pelion]] and [[Zagora-Mouresi]].<ref name=census91>{{cite web|url= http://dlib.statistics.gr/Book/GRESYE_02_0101_00086.pdf |title=Detailed census results 1991 }}&nbsp;{{small|(39&nbsp;MB)}} {{in lang|el|fr}}</ref> It was abolished in 2006.

==Geography==
[[File:Volos view from Pelion.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Volos panorama from [[Pelion]] mountain.]]
[[File:Άνω Βόλος 3750.jpg|thumb|200px|Upper part of the town (Ano Volos)]]
[[File:Graph Volos temp metric.gif|thumb|200px|Climate graph of Volos.]]

Volos is the administrative centre of the [[Magnesia (regional unit)|Magnesia]] regional unit. Many of the city domains are separated through natural barricades, such as rivers.

Three main rivers/mountain torrents all rise from mount [[Pelion]] (with its peak at {{convert|1,610|m|ft|abbr=off}}), crossing the city to create a unique urban geography, before ending in the [[Pagasetic Gulf]] flowing west. The [[Anavros]] river, famous for [[Jason]]'s pass, divides the Nea Demetriada district from the rest of the urban area. [[Krafsidonas]] is the major river passing through the city and constitutes the natural lung of the urbanized area of Volos, as well as the boundary between the major municipalities of the metropolitan city, the municipalities of Volos and [[Nea Ionia]]. Xirias (Ξηριάς), is the largest torrent in the metropolitan urban area of Volos and passes through the Nea Ionia municipal area.

===Climate===

Volos experiences a ''Csa'' hot-summer [[Mediterranean climate]], with neither particularly high nor extremely low temperatures throughout the year. Its climate is one of fairly low humidity, favorable for all kinds of activities. Measurable rainfall occurs on average around 89 days per year. Thunderstorms occur sparsely throughout the year, more often during the warmer months. Snow occurs more or less every year on a few occasions, though it usually doesn't cause disruption to daily life. The [[Pelion]] mountain, with its own microclimate, affects the city's weather, acting as a [[rain shadow]] to the north-easterly winds thus limiting the amount of precipitation the city receives in comparison to the eastern side of the mountain.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Νομός Μαγνησίας |url=http://diocles.civil.duth.gr/links/home/database/magnisia/index.html |access-date=2023-06-19 |website=diocles.civil.duth.gr}}</ref> Average temperature values, like in most regions, have slightly increased in more recent periods.

==Architecture==
Two of the most known churches of Volos, St Nicholas and St Constantine and Helen on the promenade, were designed by architect [[Aristotelis Zachos]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Φεσσά-Εμμανουήλ |first1=Ελένη |title=Η αρχιτεκτονική μεταρρύθμιση του Αριστοτέλη Ζάχου, 1908-1937 |url=https://www.archaiologia.gr/blog/2017/07/31/%CE%B7-%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%87%CE%B9%CF%84%CE%B5%CE%BA%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD%CE%B9%CE%BA%CE%AE-%CE%BC%CE%B5%CF%84%CE%B1%CF%81%CF%81%CF%8D%CE%B8%CE%BC%CE%B9%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%B1%CF%81%CE%B9/ |website=Αρχαιολογία Online |access-date=13 January 2024 |language=Greek}}</ref> Volos was once also characterised by a number of old mansions, the majority of which were destroyed after the earthquakes in 1955. Nowadays, only some of them have been saved, restored and have a new, mainly public, use.

The development of the new city coincided with the flourishing of [[neoclassicism]]. Public buildings conformed to this style and private buildings belonging to prosperous merchants were particularly sophisticated. Typical examples include:
* The 3-story Hotel de France, with its impressive decorative murals (1894, [[Jason|Iasonos]] and K. Kartali Street)
* Old Tobacco Factory of Matsaggos (1890)
* Yellow Tobacco Warehouse (1926)

Volos is one of the most industrialized provincial cities of Greece, because of its strategic location between the largest population centers of the country ([[Athens]] – [[Thessaloníki]]) and its port. Industry is intensely specialized in steel production and manufacturing. Three major steel producers ([[Metka|METKA]], [[SIDENOR]] and [[Hellenic Steel Industry]] (Ελληνική Χαλυβουργία))  have production facilities in the industrial areas of Volos and nearby [[Almyros]].
[[Heracles General Cement|AGET Heracles]], a member of the [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] group,  operates one of the largest cement facilities in the world  (with capacity exceeding 7,000,000 tn<ref name="aget">{{cite web|url=http://www.aget.gr/aget/prod_unitsen.htm|title=AGET Hraklis Facilities|access-date=2007-11-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208084052/http://www.aget.gr/aget/prod_unitsen.htm|archive-date=2008-02-08|url-status=dead}}</ref>) with its own private port, next to the city. Volos is also active in the research sector, hosting the Institute of [[Bioeconomy|Bio-Economy]] and Agri-Technology (iBO), one of the five Institutes of the Center for Research and Technology – Hellas (CERTH).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ibo.certh.gr/ |title=Home |website=ibo.certh.gr}}</ref>

==Port==

The port lies upon the ancient Thessalian settlement of Iolkos. According to Greek mythology, this was where the hero Jason built his trireme, Argo, and along with his oarsmen set course for Colchis, bringing back and marrying priestess Medea.

The new port was founded in 1893 and was the most significant element in the industrial development of the area. Today, Volos has the third-largest cargo port in Greece (after [[Piraeus]] and [[Thessaloniki]]), carrying agricultural and industrial products. In the past, it was home to a maritime link with [[Tartus]], Syria.

Ferries and flying dolphins operate daily, connecting Volos to the Magnesia islands of the [[Sporades]],  ([[Skiathos]], [[Skopelos]], [[Alonissos]]). In addition, many cruise ships use the port of Volos as a destination. During the summers of 2015 and 2016, more than 100 cruises arrived in Volos, carrying more than 100,000 visitors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.port-volos.gr/ |title=Home |website=port-volos.gr}}</ref>

==Culture==
[[File:Κινηματογράφος Αχίλλειον 3503.jpg|thumb|Cine Achilleion on the promenade]]

The wider region of Volos is a place rich with history, finding the first signals of culture in the [[Neolithic]] period. In the villages of [[Sesklo]] and [[Dimini]], the first traces of Neolithic culture in Europe have been discovered.

Moreover, close by Volos, there are the ancient Dimitrias, a town built by Dimitrios Poliorkitis in 294-2 AC. Today, the ancient [[theatre of Dimitrias]] remains preserved. Also present are the archaeological areas of Goritsa hill, archaeological findings dating from the early Christian period in [[Nea Anchialos]], and the wall of Volos's old castle, which is open to visitors.

Volos consists of a city with diverse Greek trades, as its industrial development encouraged many people to move to the city. The city's industrial and financial evolution also gradually resulted in cultural and social evolution, too; in 1894, Volos acquired its Municipal Theater and later its Gymnastics Club. In 1908, Volos became home to the first Labour Union in Greece.

After 1922, following the [[Asia Minor Catastrophe]], Volos received a large number of people from the destroyed regions. This coexistence with the locals deeply influenced the culture of the city, leaving a mark still visible in the food, music, sports, entertainment and social life of the city today.

In modern times, there are plentiful museums and galleries to be visited throughout the city, but also in the wider region. Above all, Volos forms one of the most attractive and tourist-friendly cities in Greece because of its physical setting,  combining the [[Pagasetic Gulf]] with Mount [[Pelion]].

Volos was a candidate city for the [[European Capital of Culture]], 2021.<ref>[http://www.volos2021.eu/?lang=en Volos 2021]</ref>
