'''Sandakan''' ({{IPA|zsm|ˈsandaˈkan|lang}}) formerly known at various times as '''Elopura''', is the capital of the [[Sandakan District]] in [[Sabah]], [[Malaysia]]. It is the second largest city in Sabah after [[Kota Kinabalu]]. It is located on the [[Sandakan Peninsula]] and east coast of the state in the administrative centre of [[Sandakan Division]] and was the former capital of [[North Borneo|British North Borneo]]. In 2010, the city had an estimated population of 157,330<ref name="pop">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/04Jadual_PBT_negeri/PBT_Sabah.pdf|title=Total population by ethnic group, Local Authority area and state, Malaysia, 2010|publisher=Department of Statistics Malaysia|access-date=14 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114184319/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/04Jadual_PBT_negeri/PBT_Sabah.pdf|archive-date=14 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> while the overall municipal area had a total population of 396,290.<ref name="pop"/> The population of the municipal area had increased to 439,050 by the 2020 Census.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dosm.gov.my/v1/uploads/files/6_Newsletter/Newsletter%202020/DOSM_DOSM_SABAH_1_2020_Siri-86.pdf|title=Newsletter|access-date=27 April 2023|website=dosm.gov.my|date=January 2020}}</ref>

Before the founding of Sandakan, [[Sulu Archipelago]] was the source of dispute between Spain and the [[Sultanate of Sulu]] for economic dominance in the region. By 1864, Spain had blockaded the Sultanate possessions in the Sulu Archipelago. The Sultanate of Sulu awarded a German consular service ex-member a piece of land in the Sandakan Bay to seek protection from Germany. In 1878, the Sultanate sold north-eastern Borneo to an Austro-Hungarian consul who later left the territory to a British colonial merchant. The German presence over the area raised concern among the British. As a result, a [[Madrid Protocol of 1885|protocol]] was signed between the British, German and the Spanish to recognise Spanish sovereignty over the Sulu Archipelago, in return for the Spanish not intervening in British affairs in northern Borneo.

Sandakan began to prosper when the [[British North Borneo Chartered Company|British North Borneo Company]] (BNBC) started to build a new settlement in 1879, developing it into an active commercial and trading centre as well as making it the main administrative centre for North Borneo. The British also encouraged the migration of the [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] from [[British Hong Kong]] to develop the economy of Sandakan. However, the prosperity halted when the [[Japanese occupation of British Borneo|Japanese occupied the area]]. As the war continued and Allied bombing started in 1944, the town was totally destroyed. Unable to fund the costs of the reconstruction, the administrative powers of North Borneo were handed over to the [[North Borneo (British Crown colony)|Crown Colony]] government. Subsequently, the administrative capital of North Borneo was moved to [[Jesselton]]. As part of the 1948–1955 Colonial Office Reconstruction and Development Plan, the crown colony government began to develop the fishing industry in Sandakan.

Sandakan is one of the main ports for oil, tobacco, coffee, [[sago]], and timber exports. Other economic activities include fishing, ship building, eco-tourism, and manufacturing. Among the tourist attractions in Sandakan are Sandakan Heritage Museum, Sandakan Cultural Festival, Sandakan War Memorial, [[Sepilok Orang Utan Sanctuary]], [[Turtle Islands National Park (Malaysia)|Turtle Islands National Park]], and [[Gomantong Caves]].

A first European settlement was built by a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] arms smuggler from [[Glasgow]] named [[William Cowie (merchant)|William Clark Cowie]] who named the settlement "Sandakan", (which in the [[Tausug language|Suluk language]] means "The place that was pawned").<ref name="sandakan">{{cite web|url=http://ww2.sabah.gov.my/mps/sdk/history.html|title=Founding of Sandakan|publisher=Sabah State Government|access-date=19 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609043351/http://ww2.sabah.gov.my/mps/sdk/history.html|archive-date=9 June 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was soon renamed ''Kampong German'' (Kampung Jerman), due to the presence of several German bases there.

In November 1871, Spanish gunboats bombarded [[Sama-Bajau peoples|Samal]] villages in Tawi-Tawi islands and blockaded Jolo.

During Pryer's tenure of being the first resident of Sandakan, one of his first tasks was to establish law and order. The situation in the nascent colony remained tense, with the Borneans being hostile towards the authority of the British North Borneo Company, and all-out warfare prevented only by the presence of [[Royal Navy]] ships offshore. To resolve the situation, Pryer imported policemen from [[British Raj|British India]] and [[Singapore]]. His first contingent of police was made up of Indian [[Sikh]]s with a large body stature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsabahtimes.com.my/insite/insite_display/691|title=Sabah Early History|work=[[Government of Sabah|Sabah State Government]]|publisher=[[New Sabah Times]]|date=6 December 2007|access-date=8 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140530141213/http://www.newsabahtimes.com.my/insite/insite_display/691|archive-date=30 May 2014|url-status=dead|quote=His first contingent of police was, therefore, made up of Indian Sikhs whose stature alone must have been quite frightening to some of the natives.}}</ref> The Indian police were probably from the [[Sepoy]] [[Company (military unit)|Company]] in India and were generally called 'Sipai' by the locals.<ref name="pandisan"/>

[[File:Sandakan Bomb Damage (AWM 120473).JPG|thumb|left|Sandakan was heavily damaged by bombing from [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] at the end of the war. The bombing was intended to flush out the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Japanese]] who occupied the town during this period. The heavy damage to the town eventually led to the British moving the capital of [[British North Borneo]] to [[Jesselton]].]]
At the end of the war, the British North Borneo Company returned to administer the town but were unable to finance the costs of reconstruction. They gave control of North Borneo to the [[North Borneo (British Crown colony)|British Crown]] on 15 July 1946. The new colonial government chose to move the capital of North Borneo to [[Jesselton]] instead of rebuilding it as the cost of reconstruction was higher due to the damage. Although Sandakan was no longer the administrative capital, it still remained as the "economic capital" with its port activities related to the export of timber and other agricultural products in the east coast.<ref name="unipa">{{cite web|url=http://elibrary.pps-unipasby.ac.id/files/disk1/1/jtppsunipasby--ismailali-4-1-sosiohum-t.pdf |author=Ismail Ali |title=The Role and Contribution of the British Administration and the Capitalist in the North Borneo Fishing Industry, 1945–63 |publisher=Pascasarjana Unipa Surabaya |access-date=22 April 2015 |pages=1–3 |quote=The Crown Colony administration chose Jesselton, now known as Kota Kinabalu, as its new centre of administration and the new capital. This decision was made owing to the devastating damage suffered by Sandakan as mentioned previously and the ever growing development of the rubber industry along the Western residential coast of North Borneo. Although Sandakan is no longer the capital city, it remained as the "economic capital of the state" for North Borneo, specifically as a port which handles activities pertaining to the export of timber and other agricultural products from the eastern coast of North Borneo. While, the fishing industry at the final stages of the British administration era saw a great involvement by the Hong Kong "towkays" to the prawn commodity around the coasts of Kudat, Sandakan and up Tambisan. For example, in 1951 the British administration granted an Hong Kong based Chun-Li Company to operate prawn industry in the North Borneo waters. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607141206/http://elibrary.pps-unipasby.ac.id/files/disk1/1/jtppsunipasby--ismailali-4-1-sosiohum-t.pdf |archive-date=7 June 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> To improve the facilities, the Crown Colony administration designed a plan, later known as the "Colonial Office Reconstruction and Development Plan for North Borneo: 1948–1955”. This plan established the Sandakan Fisheries Department in April 1948. As a first step towards the development of Sandakan's fishing industry, the Crown Colony devised the "Young Working Plan" through the "Colonial Development and Welfare Scheme". Through this plan, the British administration were given the responsibility to import basic materials from Hong Kong for fishermen and distribute the materials at a price lower than the one offered by the capitalists. As a result, Hong Kong ''towkays'' (bosses) were involved with the fishing industry in Sandakan.<ref name="unipa"/>
