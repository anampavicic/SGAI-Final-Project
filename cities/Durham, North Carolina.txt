A railway depot was established in 1849 on land donated by [[Bartlett S. Durham]], the namesake of the city. Following the [[American Civil War]], the community of Durham Station expanded rapidly, in part due to the [[tobacco industry]]. The town was incorporated by act of the [[North Carolina General Assembly]], in April 1869. The establishment of [[Durham County, NC|Durham County]] was ratified by the General Assembly 12 years later, in 1881.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Durham, North Carolina}}

===Pre-establishment===
The [[Eno people|Eno]] and the [[Occaneechi|Occoneechi]], related to the [[Sioux]] and the [[Shakori]], lived in the area and may have established a village named Adshusheer (or Ajusher) in the area which became Durham.<ref>The Travels of Richard Traunter, page 38, ([1699], Sandra L. Dahlberg ed., University of Virginia Press, 2022).</ref> [[Trading Path|The Occaneechi Path]], a corridor of trading roads and trails, went through the area. Native Americans expanded the region by establishing settlements and commercial transportation routes.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Overview of Durham History |url=https://www.museumofdurhamhistory.org/learn/overview-of-durham-history/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406053213/https://www.museumofdurhamhistory.org/learn/overview-of-durham-history/ |archive-date=2023-04-06 |access-date=2023-06-08 |publisher=Museum of Durham History |language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=July 2020 |title=About Durham |url=https://law.nccu.edu/about/about-durham/ |access-date=2023-06-08 |publisher=NC Central University School of Law |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1701, English explorer [[John Lawson (explorer)|John Lawson]], documented the area and would later call it "the flower of the Carolinas". Lawson claimed that Ajusher was situated {{convert|14|mi}} from Occaneechi Town.<ref>John Lawson, A New Voyage to Carolina, page 62 ([1709] Hugh Talmage Lefler ed., Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina press, 1967).</ref> In the mid-1700s, Scots, Irish, and English colonists settled on land granted to [[George Carteret]] by [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]{{dubious|Which Carteret and which king?|date=May 2024}}, a grant that had by then been inherited by his great-grandson [[John Carteret, 2nd Earl Granville|John]]. Early settlers built settlements as well as farms and mills, like [[West Point Mill]].<ref name=":1"/><ref name=":2"/>

Frontiersmen in the area, prior to the [[American Revolutionary War]], participated in the [[Regulator Movement]]. Loyalist militia used Cornwallis Road to cut through the area in 1771 to quell the rebellion. William Johnston, a local a farmer and shopkeeper, made munitions for the [[Continental Army]], served in the [[North Carolina Provincial Congress|Provincial Congress]] in 1775, and financially supported [[Daniel Boone]] on his westward explorations.<ref name=":1"/><ref name=":2"/>

===Antebellum and Civil War===
Prior to the arrival of the railroad, the area now known as Durham was the eastern part of present-day Orange County and was almost entirely agricultural, with a few businesses catering to travelers (particularly livestock drivers) along the Hillsborough Road. This road, eventually followed by US Route 70, was the major east–west route in North Carolina from colonial times until the construction of interstate highways. Steady population growth and an intersection with the road connecting Roxboro and Fayetteville made the area near this site suitable for a US Post Office. Roxboro, Fayetteville and Hillsborough Roads remain major thoroughfares in Durham, although they no longer exactly follow their early 19th century rights-of-way.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History Beneath Our Feet |url=http://museumofdurhamhistory.org/beneathourfeet/streets |url-status=dead |access-date=2022-11-06 |publisher=Museum of Durham History |archive-date=November 6, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221106150037/http://museumofdurhamhistory.org/beneathourfeet/streets }}</ref>

Large plantations, [[Hardscrabble (Bahama, North Carolina)|Hardscrabble]], [[Fairntosh Plantation|Fairntosh]], [[Lipscomb House|Lipscomb]], [[Walnut Hall (Durham, North Carolina)|Walnut Hall]], [[Patterson Plantation|Patterson]], and [[Leigh Farm|Leigh]] among them, were established in the antebellum period. By 1860, [[Stagville|Stagville Plantation]] lay at the center of one of the largest plantation holdings in the South. African slaves were brought to labor on these farms and plantations, and slave quarters became the hearth of distinctively Southern cultural traditions involving crafts, social relations, life rituals, music, and dance. There were free [[African-American]]s in the area as well, including several who fought in the Revolutionary War.

Durham's location is a result of the needs of the 19th century railroad industry. The wood-burning steam locomotives of the time had to stop frequently for wood and water and the new [[North Carolina Railroad]] needed a depot between the settled towns of Raleigh and Hillsborough. The residents of what is now downtown Durham thought their businesses catering to livestock drivers had a better future than "a new-fangled nonsense like a railroad" and refused to sell or lease land for a depot.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Durham |url=https://durhamnc.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/4097 |access-date=24 January 2017 |publisher=City of Durham |format=PDF}}</ref> In 1849, a North Carolina Railroad depot was established on a four-acre tract of land donated by [[Bartlett S.

Durham Station, as it was known for its first 20 years, was a depot for the occasional passenger or express package until early April 1865, when the Federal Army commanded by Major General [[William T. Sherman]] occupied the nearby state capital of Raleigh during the American Civil War. The last formidable Confederate Army in the South, commanded by General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], was headquartered in [[Greensboro]] {{convert|50|mi|km}} to the west. After the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia by Gen. [[Robert E. Lee]] at [[Appomattox, Virginia]] on April 9, 1865, Gen. Johnston sought surrender terms, which were negotiated on April 17, 18 and 26 at [[Bennett Place]], the small farm of James and Nancy Bennett, located halfway between the army's lines about {{convert|3|mi|km}} west of Durham Station.

As both armies passed through Durham, Hillsborough, and surrounding Piedmont communities, they enjoyed the mild flavor of the area's [[Virginia tobacco|Brightleaf tobacco]], which was considered more pleasant to smoke or chew than was available back home after the war. Some began sending letters to Durham to get more.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Yeargin |first=W.W. |year=2006 |title=Tobacco– Part 3: The Rise of 'Big Tobacco' |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/tobacco-part-3-rise-big-tobacco |access-date=2018-01-25 |website=NCpedia |publisher=NC Dept. of Natural and Cultural Resources – State Library of NC – NC Government & Heritage Library |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Reconstruction and the rise of Durham tobacco===
[[File:First Duke tobacco factory and surrounding buildings 1883.jpg|thumb|left|Early view of first [[Washington Duke|Duke]] tobacco factory and family home, Durham, 1883]]
The community of Durham Station grew slowly before the Civil War, but expanded rapidly following the war. Much of this growth attributed to the establishment of a thriving [[tobacco]] industry. Veterans returned home after the war with an interest in acquiring more of the tobacco they had sampled in North Carolina. Numerous orders were mailed to John Ruffin Green's tobacco company requesting more of the Durham tobacco. W.T. Blackwell partnered with Green and renamed the company as the "[[Bull Durham Tobacco Factory]]".<ref name=":0"/> The name "Bull Durham" is said to have been taken from the bull on the British [[Colman's]] Mustard, which Mr. Blackwell mistakenly believed was manufactured in [[Durham, England|Durham]], England.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Richardson |first=Lynn |title=The Bull City: Overview of Durham History |url=https://www.museumofdurhamhistory.org/learn/overview-of-durham-history/ |access-date=2020-07-30 |publisher=Museum of Durham History |language=en-US}}</ref> Mustard known as Durham Mustard was originally produced in [[Durham, England|Durham]], England, by Mrs Clements and later by Ainsley during the eighteenth century. However, production of the original Durham Mustard has now been passed into the hands of [[Colman's]] of [[Norwich]], England.
[[File:WhiteDoorColoredDoor.jpg|thumb|Separate "white" and "colored" entrances to a cafe in Durham, North Carolina, 1940]]

===Incorporation===
As Durham Station's population rapidly increased, the station became a town and was incorporated by act of the [[North Carolina General Assembly]], on April 10, 1869. It was named for the man who provided the land on which the station was built, Dr. Bartlett Durham. At the time of its incorporation by the General Assembly, Durham was located in Orange County. The increase in business activity, land transfers etc., made the day long trip back and forth to the county seat in Hillsborough untenable, so twelve years later, on April 17, 1881, a bill for the establishment of [[Durham County, North Carolina|Durham County]] was ratified by the General Assembly, having been introduced by Caleb B.Green, creating Durham County from the eastern portion of Orange County and the western portion of [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]]. In 1911, parts of [[Cedar Fork Township, Wake County, North Carolina|Cedar Fork Township]] of [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]] was transferred to Durham County and became [[Carr Township, Durham County, North Carolina|Carr Township]].<ref name="1923hill_dir_durham" />

===Early growth (1900–1970)===
[[File:SKYL024 Old Bull Building ATC DiscoverDurham.jpg|thumb|Overlooking the newly renovated [[American Tobacco|American Tobacco Campus]]|left]]
The rapid growth and prosperity of the Bull Durham Tobacco Company, and [[Washington Duke]]'s W. Duke & Sons Tobacco Company, resulted in the rapid growth of the city of Durham. Throughout the [[Gilded Age]] and into the early twentieth century, Durham industrialists, including [[George Washington Watts]], [[John Sprunt Hill]], and [[Julian S. Carr]], built large mansions such as [[Somerset Villa]], [[Harwood Hall]], the [[John Sprunt Hill House]], and [[Greystone (Durham, North Carolina)|Greystone Manor]]. Washington Duke was a good businessman, but his sons were brilliant and established what amounted to a monopoly of the smoking and chewing tobacco business in the United States by 1900. In the early 1910s, the Federal Government forced a breakup of the Duke's business under the antitrust laws. The Dukes retained what became known as [[American Tobacco]], a major corporation in its own right, with manufacturing based in Durham. American Tobacco's ubiquitous advertisements on radio shows beginning in the 1930s and television shows up to 1970 was the nation's image of Durham until Duke University supplanted it in the late 20th century.

[[File:Durham Main Street.JPG|thumb|Looking west along Parrish Street, home of what was then known as Black Wall Street]]
Prevented from further investment in the tobacco industry, the Dukes turned to the then new industry of electric power generation, which they had been investing in since the early 1890s. [[Duke Power]] (now Duke Energy) brought in electricity from hydroelectric dams in the western mountains of North Carolina through the newly invented technology of high voltage power lines. At this time (1910–1920), the few towns and cities in North Carolina that had electricity depended on local "powerhouses". These were large, noisy, and smoky coal-fired plants located next to the railroad tracks. Duke Power quickly took over the electricity franchises in these towns and then electrified all the other towns of central and western North Carolina, making even more money than they ever made from tobacco.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Our Company: Our History |url=https://www.duke-energy.com/our-company/about-us/our-history |access-date=2022-11-06 |publisher=Duke Energy |language=en-US}}</ref> Duke Power also had a significant business in local franchises for public transit (buses and trolleys) before local government took over this responsibility in the mid- to late 20th century. Duke Power ran Durham's public bus system (now [[GoDurham]]) until 1991.

The success of the tobacco industry in the late 19th and early 20th century encouraged the then-growing textile industry to locate just outside Durham. The early electrification of Durham was also a large incentive. Drawing a labor force from the economic demise of single-family farms in the region at the time, these textile mills doubled the population of Durham. These areas were known as East Durham and West Durham until they were eventually annexed by the City of Durham.

Much of the early city [[architecture]], both commercial and residential, dates from the period of 1890–1930. Durham recorded its worst fire in history on March 23, 1914. The multimillion-dollar blaze destroyed a large portion of the downtown business district. The fire department's water source failed during the blaze, prompting voters to establish a city-owned water system in place of the private systems that had served the city since 1887.<ref>{{cite web |title=This day in 1914 |url=https://www.facebook.com/museumofdurhamhistory/photos/a.286366331389809.90199.144344455591998/835801223112981/?type=1&theater |url-access=limited |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/144344455591998/835801223112981 |archive-date=2022-02-26 |access-date=March 23, 2014 |website=Facebook |publisher=Museum of Durham History}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Durham quickly developed a black community, the center of which was an area known as ''[[Hayti, Durham, North Carolina|Hayti]]'', (pronounced HAY-tie), just south of the center of town, where some of the most prominent and successful black-owned businesses in the country during the early 20th century were established. These businesses — the best known of which are [[North Carolina Mutual Life Insurance Company]] and [[Mechanics and Farmers Bank (Durham, North Carolina)|Mechanics & Farmers Bank]] — were centered on Parrish St., which would come to be known as "Black Wall Street".<ref>{{cite web |last=Cain |first=Brooke |last2=Quillin |first2=Martha |date=February 2021 |title=10 NC Black history lessons you likely weren't taught in school (but should have been) |url=https://amp.newsobserver.com/news/local/article249151195.html |access-date=February 27, 2021 |website=Raleigh News & Observer |language=en}}</ref> In 1910, [[James E. Shepard|Dr. James E. Shepard]] founded [[North Carolina Central University]], the nation's first publicly supported liberal arts college for African-Americans.

In 1924, [[James Buchanan Duke]] established a philanthropic foundation in honor of his father [[Washington Duke]] to support Trinity College in Durham. The college changed its name to [[Duke University]] and built a large campus and hospital a mile west of Trinity College (the original site of Trinity College is now known as the [[Duke University East Campus|Duke East Campus]]).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Williams |first=Shane |date=March 7, 2016 |title=Duke University |url=https://northcarolinahistory.org/encyclopedia/duke-university/ |access-date=March 3, 2020 |website=North Carolina History Project |publisher=[[John Locke Foundation]]}}</ref>

Durham's manufacturing fortunes declined during the mid-20th century. [[Textile]] mills began to close during the 1930s. Competition from other tobacco companies (as well as a decrease in smoking after the 1960s) reduced revenues from Durham's tobacco industry.

In a far-sighted move in the late 1950s, Duke University, along with the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill and North Carolina State University in Raleigh, persuaded the North Carolina Legislature to purchase a large tract of sparsely settled land in southern Durham County and create the nation's first "science park" for industry. Cheap land and a steady supply of trained workers from the local universities made the [[Research Triangle Park]] an enormous success which, along with the expansion resulting from the clinical and scientific advances of Duke Medical Center and Duke University, more than made up for the decline of Durham's tobacco and textile industries.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Emerson |first=Rob |title=Golden Belt: Our History |url=https://www.goldenbeltarts.com/community/our-history/ |access-date=2022-11-06 |publisher=Golden Belt Arts}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Williams |first=Wiley J. |date=2006 |title=Research Triangle Park |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/research-triangle-park |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=NCpedia}}</ref>

===Civil rights movement===
As a result of its substantial African-American community, including many activists, a prominent [[civil rights movement]] developed in Durham. Multiple sit-ins were held, and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], visited the city during the struggle for equal rights. The Durham Committee on Negro Affairs, organized in 1935 by C.C. Spaulding, Louis Austin, Conrad Pearson, and [[James E. Shepard]], has been cited nationally for its role in fighting for black voting rights. The committee also has used its voting strength to pursue social and economic rights for African-Americans and other ethnic groups. In 1957, [[Douglas E. Moore]], minister of Durham's Asbury Temple Methodist Church, along with other religious and community leaders, pioneered sit-ins throughout North Carolina to protest discrimination at lunch counters that served only whites.

Widely credited as the [[Royal Ice Cream sit-in|first sit-in of the civil rights movement in North Carolina]], on June 23, 1957, Moore and six others assembled at the church to plan the protest. The young African Americans moved over to the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] [[Royal Ice Cream|Royal Ice Cream Parlor]] and took up whites-only booths. When they refused to budge, the manager called the police who charged them with trespassing. Unlike the [[Greensboro Four]], three years later, the Royal Seven were arrested and ultimately found guilty of trespassing.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gregg |first=R. |date=January 19, 2008 |title=NC Finally Recognizes Pre-Woolworth Sit-Ins In 1956 |url=http://www.greensboro3.com/default.asp?sourceid=&smenu=1&twindow=&mad=&sdetail=1495&wpage=1&skeyword=&sidate=&ccat=&ccatm=&restate=&restatus=&reoption=&retype=&repmin=&repmax=&rebed=&rebath=&subname=&pform=&sc=2762&hn=greensboro3&he=.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202064022/http://greensboro3.com/default.asp?sourceid=&smenu=1&twindow=&mad=&sdetail=1495&wpage=1&skeyword=&sidate=&ccat=&ccatm=&restate=&restatus=&reoption=&retype=&repmin=&repmax=&rebed=&rebath=&subname=&pform=&sc=2762&hn=greensboro3&he=.com |archive-date=February 2, 2009 |work=The Greensboro Telegram |df=mdy}}</ref><ref name="sciblog_Royal">{{cite web|url=http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/11/dedication_of_1957_royal_ice_c.php |title=Dedication of the 1957 Royal Ice Cream sit-in historical marker |date=November 29, 2009 |publisher=Terra Sigillata |access-date=May 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816045824/http://scienceblogs.com/terrasig/2009/11/dedication_of_1957_royal_ice_c.php |archive-date=August 16, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name="hwymkrg123">{{cite web|url=http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?ct=ddl&sp=search&k=Markers&sv=G-123%20-%20ROYAL%20ICE%20CREAM%20SIT-IN |title=G-123 Royal Ice Cream Sit-In |publisher=North Carolina Highway Historical Marker Program |access-date=May 13, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818183910/http://www.ncmarkers.com/Markers.aspx?ct=ddl&sp=search&k=Markers&sv=G-123%20-%20ROYAL%20ICE%20CREAM%20SIT-IN |archive-date=August 18, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref>

The six-month-long sit-in at a [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth]]'s counter in [[Greensboro sit-ins|Greensboro, North Carolina]], captured the nation's attention. Within a week, students from North Carolina College at Durham and Duke University staged a sit-in in Durham. About a week later, Martin Luther King Jr. met Moore in Durham, where King coined his famous rallying cry "Fill up the jails," during a speech at White Rock Baptist Church. Advocating non-violent confrontation with segregation laws for the first time, King said, "Let us not fear going to jail. If the officials threaten to arrest us for standing up for our rights, we must answer by saying that we are willing and prepared to fill up the jails of the South."

This community was not enough to prevent the demolition of portions of the Hayti district for the construction of the Durham Freeway during the late 1960s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ehrsam|first1=Frederick|title=The downfall of Durham's historic Hayti: Propagated or preempted by urban renewal?|url=https://sites.duke.edu/djepapers/files/2016/10/Ehrsam-Fred_DJE.pdf}}</ref> The freeway construction resulted in losses to other historic neighborhoods, including Morehead Hill, West End, and West Durham. Combined with large-scale demolition using Urban Renewal funds, Durham suffered significant losses to its historic architectural base.

==Geography==
Durham is located in the east–central part of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region at {{Coord|35|59|19|N|78|54|26|W|type:city}} (35.99, -78.9).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html| publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]| access-date=April 23, 2011| date=February 12, 2011| title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> Like much of the region, its topography is generally flat with some rolling hills.

As of 2022 the city had a total area of {{convert|116.19|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|115.36|sqmi}} was land and {{convert|0.82|sqmi}} (0.71%) was water.<ref name="TigerWebMapServer"/>

The soil is predominantly clay, making it poor for agriculture. The [[Eno River]], a tributary of the [[Neuse River]], passes through the northern part of Durham, along with several other small creeks. The center of Durham is on a ridge that forms the divide between the Neuse River watershed, flowing east to [[Pamlico Sound]], and the [[Cape Fear River]] watershed, flowing south to the Atlantic near [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]]. A small portion of the city is in [[Wake County]].

Durham is located 10 miles northeast of [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]],<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.distance-cities.com/distance-chapel-hill-nc-to-durham-nc |title=Distance between Chapel Hill, NC, and Durham, NC |website=Distance Between Cities |access-date=August 22, 2021}}</ref> 21 miles northwest of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], 50 miles east of [[Greensboro, North Carolina|Greensboro]], 121 miles northeast of [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] and 134 miles southwest of [[Richmond, Virginia]].

===Climate===
The climate of Durham is [[humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'' according to the [[Köppen classification]] system), with hot and humid summers, cool winters, and warm to mild spring and autumn. Durham receives abundant precipitation, with thunderstorms common in the summer and high temperatures from 80 to 100 degrees F. The region sees an average of {{convert|7|in|mm}} of snow per year, with any snowfall usually melting within a few days.

The Durham area consistently ranks in the top 10 most challenging places to live with seasonal allergies.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.aafa.org/allergy-capitals/ | title=How the Top 100 U.S. Cities Rank for Seasonal Pollen Allergies | publisher=Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, supported by Bayer Claritin®}}</ref>

Climate change is expected to increase the number of days of extreme precipitation in Durham as well as moderately increase temperature within the region. The number of days of inland flooding within the Piedmont is also expected to increase, which puts Durham at higher risk of future flooding.<ref>{{Cite web |title=North Carolina Climate Science Report :: North Carolina Institute for Climate Studies |url=https://ncics.org/programs/nccsr/ |access-date=2023-01-09}}</ref> High-intensity short-duration storms are predicted to grow in frequency to upwards of 9 days a year by 2100.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Extreme Precipitation and Flooding {{!}} Durham County |url=https://www.dconc.gov/county-departments/departments-a-e/engineering-and-environmental-services/sustainability-office/climate-resilience/excessive-precipitation |access-date=2023-01-09 |publisher=Durham County, NC, government |language=en}}</ref> Inland flooding is anticipated to have a greater impact on the elderly and other at-risk groups.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Community Health Assessment |url=https://www.dcopublichealth.org/resources/health-resources-data/community-health-assessment |access-date=2023-01-09 |publisher=Durham County, NC, Public Health |language=en}}</ref>

Durham's professional sports team is the [[Durham Bulls]] [[International League]] [[baseball]] team. A movie involving an earlier [[Carolina League]] team of that name, ''[[Bull Durham]]'', was produced in 1988. Today's Bulls play in the [[Durham Bulls Athletic Park]], on the southern end of downtown, constructed in 1994. One of the more successful teams in the minor leagues, the Bulls usually generate an annual attendance of around 500,000. Previously [[Durham Athletic Park]] (DAP), located on the northern end of downtown, had served as the Bull's ballpark. Historically, many players for the current and former Durham Bulls teams have transferred to the big leagues after several years in the minor leagues. DAP has been preserved for the use of other teams as well as for concerts sponsored by the City of Durham and other events. The Durham Dragons, a women's fast pitch [[softball]] team, played in the Durham Athletic Park from 1998 to 2000. The DAP recently went through a $5 million renovation.

Key political issues have been the redevelopment of Downtown Durham and revival of other historic neighborhoods and commercial districts, ending cash bail, ending mandatory sentencing minimums, decriminalization of marijuana, raising minimum wage for city employees to $15, the fluoridation of public drinking water, a 45% reduction of crime, a 10-year plan to end homelessness, initiatives to reduce truancy, and growth and development. A merger of Durham City Schools (several [[inner city]] neighborhoods) and Durham County Schools in the early 1990s ignited controversy.

Most travel in Durham is by private motor vehicle on its network of public streets and highways. Important arteries for traffic include [[NC 147]], which connects Duke University, downtown, and Research Triangle Park, [[U.S. Route 15 in North Carolina|U.S. 15-501]] between Durham and [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], [[Interstate 85 in North Carolina|I-85]], connecting Durham to Virginia and western North Carolina cities, and I-40 running across southern Durham County between the Research Triangle Park and Chapel Hill. The I-40 corridor has been the main site of commercial and residential development in Durham since its opening in the early 1990s. Over 95% of commuters use a car to get to work, with 14% of those people in carpools.

Durham maintains an extensive network of bicycle routes and trails and has been recognized with a Bicycle Friendly Community Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story_news_durham/9550560/article-Cycling-group--Durham--Bicycle-Friendly- |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711163639/http://www.heraldsun.com/view/full_story_news_durham/9550560/article-Cycling-group--Durham--Bicycle-Friendly- |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 11, 2011 |title=Cycling group Durham Bicycle Friendly |publisher=The Herald-Sun |access-date=July 15, 2012 }}</ref> The [[American Tobacco Trail]] begins in downtown and continues south through Research Triangle Park and ends in Wake County. The city is also considering furthering the progress on the Triangle Greenway System.

Air travel is provided by [[Raleigh–Durham International Airport]], 12 miles southeast of Durham, which enplanes about 4.5 million passengers per year. Frequent service (five flights a day or more) is available to Boston, Charlotte, Philadelphia, New York LaGuardia, New York Kennedy, Newark, Washington Reagan, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare, Dallas, Houston, and Atlanta, GA.

National bus service is provided by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] at the Durham Transit Station in downtown Durham, which opened in 2009. [[GoDurham]] provides municipal bus service.
[[File:TSPT021 Durham Station Transportation Center DiscoverDurham.jpg|thumb|left|Durham Station Transportation Center]]
[[GoTriangle]] offers scheduled, fixed-route regional and commuter bus service between Raleigh and the region's other principal cities of Durham, [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]] and [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]], as well as to and from the Raleigh–Durham International Airport, [[Research Triangle Park]] and several of the region's larger suburban communities. GoTriangle also coordinates an extensive [[vanpool]] and [[carpool|rideshare]] program that serves the region's larger employers and commute destinations.

From 1995, the cornerstone of GoTriangle's long-term plan was a {{convert|28|mi|km|adj=on}} rail corridor from northeast [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], through downtown Raleigh, [[Cary, North Carolina|Cary]], and [[Research Triangle Park]], to Durham using [[Diesel multiple unit|DMU]] technology. There were proposals to extend this corridor {{convert|7|mi|km}} to [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] with [[light rail]] technology. However, in 2006 Triangle Transit deferred implementation indefinitely when the [[Federal Transit Administration]] declined to fund the program. Government agencies throughout the Raleigh–Durham metropolitan area have struggled to determine the best means of providing fixed-rail transit service for the region. The project was cancelled 2019 with costs more than $157 million.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-04-30 |title=As the Triangle's job market booms, is the area ready for a commuter rail?

The region's two [[metropolitan planning organization]]s appointed a group of local citizens in 2007 to reexamine options for future transit development in light of Triangle Transit's problems. The Special Transit Advisory Commission (STAC) retained many of the provisions of Triangle Transit's original plan, but recommended adding new bus services and raising additional revenues by adding a new local half-cent sales tax to fund the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |title=Regional Transit Infrastructure Blueprint |publisher=Transitblueprint.org |date=May 21, 2008 |access-date=July 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106111406/http://www.transitblueprint.org/stac.shtml |archive-date=November 6, 2011 }}</ref>

[[Duke University]] also maintains its own transit system. Duke Transit operates more than 30 buses, with routes throughout the campus and health system. Duke campus buses and vans have alternate schedules or do not operate during breaks and holidays.

To help create safer roadways for vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians, drivers can enroll in Durham's [[Pace Car Program]], agreeing to drive the speed limit, stop at all stop signs, stop at all red lights, and stop to let pedestrians cross the street.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.douthit.biz/docs/pace_car_brochure.pdf |title=City of Durham Pace Car Project |publisher=Douthit and Company |access-date=2017-02-24}}</ref>
