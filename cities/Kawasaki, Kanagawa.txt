{{Nihongo|'''Kawasaki'''|川崎市|Kawasaki-shi}}, {{IPA|ja|kawasaki||TomJ-Kawasaki.ogg}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]], Japan, one of the main cities of the [[Greater Tokyo Area]] and [[Keihin Industrial Area]]. It is the second most populated city in [[Kanagawa Prefecture]] after [[Yokohama]], and the [[List of cities in Japan|eighth most populated city]] in Japan (including the Tokyo Metropolitan Area).<ref name="Archived copy">{{Cite web |url=http://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/ex/stat/jinko/city/new-e.html |title=Population News of Major Cities|date=September 1, 2015 |access-date=2017-11-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113184700/http://www.city.yokohama.lg.jp/ex/stat/jinko/city/new-e.html |archive-date=2016-01-13 |url-status=dead|publisher=Statistical Information Division, Policy Bureau, City of Yokohama}}</ref>

{{As of|2017|10|01|df=US}}, the city has an estimated [[population]] of 1,503,690, with 716,470 [[household]]s,<ref name="Archived copy"/> and a [[population density]] of 10,000 persons per km<sup>2</sup>. Kawasaki is the only city in Japan with more than one million inhabitants that is not a prefectural capital. The total area is {{convert|142.70|km2|2|abbr=on}}.

== History ==
=== Prehistoric and ancient era ===
Archaeological evidence from the Japanese [[Paleolithic]] and [[Jōmon period]] can only be found in the northwest [[Tama Hills]]. The course of the Tama and the coast of the Bay of Tokyo have also changed in historical times, so that large parts of the urban area are geologically young.

=== Classical era ===
==== Nara period to the Sengoku period ====
With the introduction of the [[Ritsuryō]] legal system, the area came to the [[Musashi Province]] in the 7th century. In the [[Nara period]], the center of the Tachibana district was probably in the area of today's Takatsu district. Since the [[Heian period]], the domain of the Inage clan has expanded here. Around the [[Heiken-ji]] Buddhist temple (better known as Kawasaki-Daishi), founded in 1128, a monzen-machi, a busy district for the supply of pilgrims, soon emerged. Between the [[Kamakura period]] and [[Sengoku period]], smaller feudal lords ruled the area until it finally came under the control of the [[Later Hōjō clan]].

=== Early modern ===
In 1611, Koizumi Jidayū had Nikaryō Yōsui built, a canal system on the right bank of the Tama for irrigating the fields, which in some cases still runs through the densely built-up city. On the long-distance [[Kaidō|Kaidō roads]] [[Tōkaidō (road)|Tōkaidō]] and Nakaharakaidō built by [[Edo period|Edo]]-[[Bakufu]], stations were built in the area of what would later become Kawasaki, which increased its importance. The Kawasaki station (Kawasaki-juku, near today's Kawasaki station) on the Tōkaidō was not officially recognized until 1623 as the last of the 53 Tōkaidō stations. The Bakufu let the bridges over the Tama collapse and there were ferry connections to nearby Edo in several places in today's Kawasaki, which laid the foundation for the development of the city.

</gallery>

=== Modern ===
The rapid [[urbanization]] of the area, which continues to this day, began in the [[Meiji era|Meiji]] and [[Taishō]] eras. In 1872, [[Kawasaki Station]] was established on the [[Tōkaidō Main Line]] which was Japan's first railway line.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kawasaki Station {{!}} Japan Rail Pass |url=https://www.japan-rail-pass.com/plan-your-trip/travel-by-train/japanese-stations/kawasaki-station |access-date=2024-05-11 |website=www.japan-rail-pass.com |language=en}}</ref> In 1889, the city (machi) Kawasaki in the district (gun) Tachibana was created according to the Japanese municipal system introduced the year before. In 1912 the border between [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]] and [[Tokyo Prefecture|Tokyo]] prefectures was established as the [[Tama River]]. On July 1, 1924, the independent city (shi-) of Kawasaki with 48,394 inhabitants was formed through a merger with the city of Daishi (formerly Daishigawara) and the village of Miyuki.<ref name="shi_profile">Stadt Kawasaki: [http://www.city.kawasaki.jp/miryoku/category/63-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-0-0.html Profil, 8.

==== World War II ====
As part of [[World War II]], the city was bombed three times by the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) between April 1945 and July 1945. The most serious attack was an area bombing with [[Napalm]] bombs on April 15, 1945. The attacks destroyed around 35% of the urban area and claimed 1,520 dead and 8,759 injured. The attacks burned down 9.3&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of the city (see [[Bombing of Tokyo]]).{{Citation needed|date=May 2024}} Kawasaki became a target of the first mainland bombing by the US military in 1942, followed by multiple bombings, partly due to the city's heavy and chemical industrial complex supplying the war efforts in Asia and the Pacific.<ref>{{Cite web |title=総務省｜一般戦災死没者の追悼｜川崎市における戦災の状況（神奈川県） |url=https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/daijinkanbou/sensai/situation/state/kanto_22.html |access-date=2024-05-11 |website=総務省 |language=ja}}</ref>

=== Contemporary period ===
====Shōwa era (1945–1989)====
On April 15, 1945, large parts of the area around the train station and the industrial area at the port were destroyed by air raids. Since the 1950s, residential areas for commuters have been created in the northeastern part of the city, which are connected directly to the centers of Tokyo by new railway lines. On April 1, 1972, Kawasaki became a decree-designated city ([[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|seirei shitei toshi]]) with 5 districts. 1973<ref name="shi_profile" /> the population exceeded the million mark. In 1982 the new districts of Miyamae and Asao were created by splitting off from the districts of Takatsu and Tama. In the course of [[deindustrialization]], industrial areas have recently been increasingly converted into residential areas (mostly [[Multi-family residential]]), so that a further increase in population density can be expected.

=== Location ===
Kawasaki is located on the right bank of the [[Tama River]], which flows into the Tokyo Bay here. The city lies like a narrow band between [[Tokyo]] in the northeast and [[Yokohama]] in the southwest. The city connects the two major cities and is part of the [[Greater Tokyo Area]], the largest and most densely populated urban areas in the world.

The eastern area along the coast of [[Tokyo Bay]] is a densely populated industrial zone, part of the [[Keihin region|Keihin Industrial Zone]]. In contrast, the western districts in the [[Tama Hills]] consist largely of residential areas for commuters in the [[Tokyo]] / [[Yokohama|Yokohama region]].

=== Wards ===
Kawasaki has seven [[Wards of Japan|wards]] (''ku''):

=== Adjacent cities and towns ===
In the northeast, Kawasaki borders the [[Special wards of Tokyo]] (starting at Tokyo Bay) [[Ōta, Tokyo|Ōta]] and [[Setagaya]], in the northwest the cities (-shi) belonging to [[Tokyo Prefecture]] (-shi) [[Komae, Tokyo|Komae]], [[Chōfu, Tokyo|Chofu]], [[Machida, Tokyo|Machida]], [[Inagi]], [[Tama, Tokyo|Tama]] enclose the place. The opposite southwest side is entirely occupied by the districts of [[Tsurumi-ku, Yokohama|Tsurumi]], [[Kōhoku-ku, Yokohama|Kōhoku]], [[Tsuzuki-ku, Yokohama|Tsuzuki]] and [[Aoba-ku, Yokohama|Aoba]] in the city of Yokohama. With the completion of the [[Tokyo Bay Aqua-Line]], the city of [[Kisarazu]], located on the opposite side of the Tokyo Bay in [[Chiba Prefecture]], also became a neighbor in December 1997.

=== Bodies of water ===
Two rivers cross the urban area. The Tama unites with the tributaries Misawa, Yamashita, Gotanda, Nikaryō main river and Hirase; Katahira, Asao, Shimpukuji, Arima, E, Shibu and Yagami flow into the Tsurumi.

The land on the coast of the city is crossed by a network of [[canals]] (Tama Canal, Suehiro Canal, Chidori Canal, Yakō Canal, Daishi Canal, Mizue Canal, Shiohama Canal, Iriesaki Canal, Asano Canal, Ikegami Canal, Minami-Watarida Canal, Tanabe Canal, Shiraishi Canal and the Sakai Canal). In addition, the historic Nikaryō Yōsui canal still exists in the hinterland.
