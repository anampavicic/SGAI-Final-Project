Bahir Dar is one of the leading tourist destinations in Ethiopia, with a variety of attractions in the nearby [[Lake Tana]] and [[Blue Nile]] river. The city is known for its wide avenues lined with palm trees and a variety of colorful flowers. In 2002, it was awarded the UNESCO Cities for Peace Prize for addressing the challenges of rapid urbanization.<ref>[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001252/125255e.pdf UNESCO Cities for Peace Prize, 2002]</ref>

==History==
{{Main article|History of Bahir Dar}}

===Origins===
Originally the settlement was called Bahir Giyorgis. Between 1810 and 1900, Bahir Dar had 1,200 to 2,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite book|title=La Colonia Eritrea i suoi commerci|last=Alamanni|first=Ennio|year=1891|location=Torino}}</ref><ref name="crummey">Crummey, D.

In: Anderson, D. M. & Rathborne, R. (eds.) Africa’s urban past. James Currey, Oxford.]</ref> It was developed in situ as   a monastery and function of trading hub. In the 19th century, Bahir Dar was visited by Belgian, French, British and Italian travelers, who described it alternatively as a village or a town.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A la recherche d'une colonie belge: le consul Blondeel en Abyssinie, 1840-1842, contribution à l'histoire précoloniale de la Begique|last=Duchesne|first=Albert|publisher=Institut Royal Colonial Belge|year=1953}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=d'Abbadie|first=Antoine|date=1858|title=Mémoire sur le tonnerre en Éthiopie|journal=Mémoires présentés par divers savants à l'Académie des sciences de l'Institut de France|volume=16|pages=1–158}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Travels in Abyssinia and the Galla Country|last=Plowden|first=Walter|publisher=Longmans, Green, and Co.|year=1869|location=London}}</ref>

===20th century===
During the early 20th century, the British, desiring to construct a barrage at the outlet of Lake Tana, dispatched several study teams, such as those of Dupis (1902), Grabham and Black (1920–21) and Cheesman (1926–34).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Report upon the Basin of the Upper Nile with Proposals for the Improvement of that River|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_MXMQAAAAIAAJ|last=Garstin|first=William|publisher=National Printing Department|year=1904|location=Cairo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Lake Tana and the Blue Nile, an Abyssinian Quest|last=Cheesman|first=Robert|publisher=Macmillan and Co|year=1936|location=London}}</ref> In 1930 the Ethiopian Government sent to Bahir Dar its own team of experts, who described Bahir Dar as a village with considerable trading activity, with a population from the interior as well as from Lake Tana ports such as Zege.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Report on Lake Tsana Outlet Control Works and Ethiopian Highway from Addis Ababa to Lake Tsana|publisher=White Engineering Corporation|year=1932|location=New York}}</ref> At this time Bahir Dar was characterized by various traditional settlement areas, each of which was distinguished by the social position its members occupied. The kahenat (clergy) and balabbat communities were the most important. In addition, three groups of tenant-craftsman communities, tanners, Muslims weavers and the Weyto stone-mill grinders, lived on balabbat lands. Although all were economically interdependent, there was no intermarriage between the tenant communities or between them and the balabbat and kahenat.<ref name=":2"/>
[[File:Aerial view of Bahir Dar in 1938.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Bahir Dar in 1938]]

In May 1936, Bahir Dar was occupied by the Italians, who gave it modern urban features. Abolishing communal family ownership of land known as "Rists," they instituted private ownership. Alienating the balabbats from their rists, the allocated land for administration, the army, an airstrip and port facilities. New residential and commercial zones were demarcated. Bahir Dar was connected by motor-boats with other Lake Tana ports and by motor roads with Gonder, Debre Marqos and Addis Ababa.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=A History of Bahir Dar Town, 1936-1974|last=Seyoum|first=Seltene|publisher=Addis Ababa University|year=1988|location=Addis Ababa}}</ref> The physical and social appearance of Bahir Dar was considerably changed. New settlement patterns emerged: and Italian camp, a Muslim community and a Weyto quarter, while the tanners' quarter remained unaffected. Bahir Dar became a melting-pot of different people and cultures. In the commercial zone, different types of shops, tea-rooms, tailor shops, bars and restaurants run by foreigners made their first appearance. Ethiopian participation in this realm was insignificant.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title=My Life and Ethiopia's Progress, 1892-1937|last=Selassie|first=Haile|publisher=Oxford|year=1978}}</ref>

The Italians gave Bahir Dar political importance making it the administrative center of the Lake Tana southern territories. They also showed interest in the possibility of developing the Lake Tana and Blue Nile basic agriculturally and of exploiting their waters for hydroelectric power.<ref name=":1" /> In 1941, the Ethiopian Government was reinstated. It made Bahir Dar a capital, first at a sub-district and then at a district level. Various offices and public services were set up. In 1945 Bahir Dar was raised to the status of a municipality. In the early 1950s, it was considered to be the best site selected for the construction of an alternative capital of Ethiopia.<ref name=":0"/>

During the 1960s and 1970s, Bahir Dar grew rapidly, being the capital of the [[awrajja]] by the same name in the [[Gojjam]] province. The central government developed it as a market and transportation center of the economic growth of Lake Tana and the Blue Nile basin. A comprehensive master plan, with the new zoning, was prepared by German experts. Its implementation changed completely the physical appearance of Bahir Dar, which grew as a center of industrial and economic development. It was provided with a water supply, hydroelectric power, improved lake-port facilities, the Abbay bridge, textile mills, a hospital, and institutions of higher education which now form [[Bahir Dar University]].

During the [[Ethiopian Civil War]], in May 1988 the 603rd corp of the [[Third Revolutionary Army]] (TLA) made its headquarters at Bahir Dar. On 3–4 March 1990, the TLA abandoned Bahir Dar in disarray, blowing up the nearby bridge with several hundred soldiers which stopped the TPLF/EPRDF forces from occupying the city. However, the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF) claimed they had too few effectiveness in the area to capture the town at that time, and the [[Derg]] army reoccupied Bahir Dar a few days later.<ref name=NAI-web>[http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/B/ORTBAA.pdf "Local History in Ethiopia"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408230147/http://130.238.24.99/library/resources/dossiers/local_history_of_ethiopia/B/ORTBAA.pdf |date=8 April 2008 }} The Nordic Africa Institute website (accessed 12 February 2008)</ref> The EPRDF gained permanent control of the city around 18:10 hours on 23 February 1991, as one of the objectives of [[Operation Tewodros]].<ref>Gebru Tareke, ''The Ethiopian Revolution: War in the Horn of Africa'' (New Haven: Yale University, 2009), p. 302</ref> In the 1990s Bahir Dar experienced remarkable growth and expansion. It has become the capital of the Amhara National State. The country's free-market economic policy has encouraged investment and other market potentialities. Today Bahir Dar is not only a center of administration but also a nucleus of commerce, industry, transport, communication, health, education and tourism.

===21st century===
The city, in honor of the Millennium celebrations, hosted a National Investment Bazaar and Trade Fair on 6–9 January 2007.  Mulat Gezahegn, head of the Trade, Industry and Investment Promotion Coordination Office, told journalists that more than 150 local and foreign companies participated.<ref>[http://www.waltainfo.com/EnNews/2006/Nov/23Nov06/20901.htm "Bahirdar City to host trade fair marking Millennium celebrations"] WIC (last accessed 30 November 2006)</ref>

On 22 June 2019, the [[Amhara Region coup d'état attempt]] embroiled with coordinated assassinations of [[Government of Amhara Region|Amhara Region government]] officials in Bahir Dar and Addis Ababa. General [[Se'are Mekonnen]] along with his aide General Gizae Aberra, President of Amhara Region [[Ambachew Mekonnen]] along with advisor Ezez Wassie and Amhara Region Attorney General Megbaru Kebede were victims of the assassination. On 24 June, state media announced that General [[Asaminew Tsige]] was shot dead in Bahir Dar.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ethiopia army chief killed in failed regional coup |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/6/23/ethiopias-amhara-state-chief-killed-amid-regional-coup-attempt |access-date=2022-08-07 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=AfricaNews |date=2019-06-25 |title=Questions surrounding Ethiopia's attempted Amhara coup |url=https://www.africanews.com/2019/06/25/questions-surrounding-ethiopia-s-attempted-amhara-coup/ |access-date=2022-08-07 |website=Africanews |language=en}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Bahir Dar has a borderline [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw''), very close to a [[subtropical highland climate]] (''Cwb''). Afternoon temperatures are very warm to hot year-round, and morning temperatures cool; however, the diurnal range is much larger in the largely cloudless [[dry season]].

===The Wayto caste===
{{main| Weyto caste }} 
In 1938, an Italian tourist guide noticed well established Wayto villages on Bahir Dar’s lakeshore.<ref name="cti">Consociazione Turistica Italiana (1938) [http://hdl.handle.net/2307/945 Guida dell’ Africa Orientale Italiana, Milano, Italia.]</ref>

The Wayto nowadays live in three distinct villages within Bahir Dar’s city boundaries; the buildings are made of clay with thatched roofs and have a lifespan of about five years.<ref name="appelhans">Appelhans, N.

In Bahir Dar, the Wayto are outcast because their traditional lifestyle is considered impure; for the Orthodox Christians the food habits are impure, and the Muslim community does not recognise them as true Muslims because they continue worshipping the [[Nile]]. Hence, the majority of the population remains wary of the Wayto.<ref name="oestigaard">Oestigaard, T.

Power relations in the early constitution of Bahir Dar as a town have led to a situation in which the marginalisation of the Wayto has been institutionalised. Access to the city’s facilities, including education and health care, remain out of reach based on stigmata.

The health of the Wayto community in Bahir Dar is affected because they continue drinking the lake water, which has become strongly polluted.<ref name="darmon"/>

The Wayto villages need regularly to change their place by order of the authorities for several reasons:<ref name="ajala">Ajala O.A.

*ritual places are contested by other population groups;
*Amhara have greater financial power to obtain the land;
*the Wayto do not hold land titles; and
*overall, they have a weak position in negotiation.
