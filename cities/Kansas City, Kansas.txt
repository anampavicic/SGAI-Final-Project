==History==
{{See also|History of Kansas}}
In October 1872, "old" Kansas City, Kansas, was incorporated. The first city election was held on October 22 of that year by order of Judge Hiram Stevens of the Tenth Judicial District and resulted in the election of Mayor James Boyle. The mayors of the city after its organization were James Boyle, C. A. Eidemiller, A. S. Orbison, Eli Teed, and Samuel McConnell. In June 1880, the [[Governor of Kansas]], [[John St. John (American politician)|John St. John]], proclaimed the city of Kansas City a city of the second class with Mayor McConnell present.

In March 1886, "new" Kansas City, Kansas, was formed through the consolidation of five municipalities: "old" Kansas City, Armstrong, [[Armourdale, Kansas|Armourdale]], Riverview, and Wyandotte. The oldest city of the group was Wyandotte, which was formed in 1857 by [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and Methodist missionaries.<ref name="book1890"/>{{Rp|370, 384, 388}}

In the 1890s, the city saw an explosive growth in population as a [[streetcar suburb]] of Kansas City, Missouri. This growth continued until the 1930s. It was one of the nation's 100 largest cities for many [[United States Census|U.S. Census]] counts, from 1890 to 1960, including 1920, when it had a population of over 100,000 residents for the first time.<ref>[Media:https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab15.txt {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080814041159/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0027/tab15.txt |date=August 14, 2008 }}]</ref>

As with adjacent Kansas City, Missouri, the percentage of the city's most populous ethnic group, [[non-Hispanic whites]], has declined from 76.3% in 1970 to 40.2% in 2010.<ref name="KCKFacts">{{cite web |url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/20/2036000.html |title=Kansas City (city), Kansas |work=State & County QuickFacts |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120823021817/http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/20/2036000.html |archive-date=August 23, 2012  }}</ref><ref name="KansasRace">{{cite web|title=Kansas – Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 }}</ref> In 1997, voters approved a proposition to unify the city and county governments, creating the Unified Government of Wyandotte County.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Mayors – Unified Government|url=http://www.wycokck.org/Mayor/History.aspx|website=wycokck.org|publisher=Unified Government of Wyandotte County and Kansas City, Kansas|access-date=May 31, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171012041032/http://www.wycokck.org/Mayor/History.aspx|archive-date=October 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Kansas City lies in the [[Midwestern United States]], as well as near the geographic center of the country, at the confluence of the longest river in the country, the [[Missouri River]], and the [[Kansas River]] (also known as the Kaw River).

Kansas City is situated on the edge of the "[[Tornado Alley]]", a broad region where cold air from the [[Rocky Mountains]] in Canada collides with warm air from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], leading to the formation of powerful storms, especially during the spring.

==Government==

===City government===
Kansas City, Kansas, has a [[consolidated city-county]] government in which the city and county have been merged into one jurisdiction. As such, it is simultaneously a city, which is a municipal corporation, and a county, which is an administrative division of a state. The Kansas Legislature passed enabling legislation in 1997, and voters approved the consolidation proposal the same year.

The Kansas City, Kansas Police Department was founded in 1898. By 1918, the department had begun taking photographs and fingerprints of all the people its officers had arrested.

The Kansas City, Kansas Fire Department was founded on December 25, 1883. The fire department is part of the Firefighter's Relief Association and the International Association of Fire Fighters. IAFF Local 64 is a charter member and was organized on February 28, 1918. The department has 18 fire stations in the city and covers an area of approximately 127 square miles. The department also has specialty teams, including heavy rescue, hazardous materials, foam team, water rescue, tactical medic, trench rescue, high angle/rope rescue, and technical urban search and rescue. The fire department has four public service programs: a citizens assist program, fire prevention, safe place, and a smoke detector program.

[[Kansas City Area Transportation Authority]] provides transportation for 60k riders daily. A portion of I-70 was the first project in the United States completed under the provisions of the new Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956 (though not the first constructed or to begin construction).
