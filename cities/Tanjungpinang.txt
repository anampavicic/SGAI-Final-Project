Tanjungpinang – whose name is taken from the position of a [[Beach|beach tree]] that juts into the sea – occupies a strategic location on the south of [[Bintan Island]], guarding the mouth of the Bintan River. Tanjungpinang has [[ferry]] and [[Motorboat|speedboat]] connections to [[Batam]], [[Singapore]] (40&nbsp;km away), and [[Johor Bahru]]. The city is also served by [[Raja Haji Fisabilillah International Airport]], located about 7 km east of the city center.

Over the centuries, Tanjungpinang came under the control of Sumatra, Malacca, the Netherlands, Britain, and Japan.  These contacts each influenced its culture, also being a centre of Malay culture and trade traffic. In the 18th century, it was a capital of the [[Johor Sultanate|Johor–Riau–Lingga Empire]].

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2007}}

The name ''Tanjungpinang'' is taken from the position of beach nut tree that juts into the sea.{{explain|date=May 2017}} Trees that are in the Cape which is a guide for voyagers who will go to Bintan River.{{clarify|date=May 2017}} The Tanjungpinang River is the entrance to Bintan, where the Bentan empire{{clarify|date=May 2017}} was based in what is now the district of Bukit Batu.

===Early history===
Tanjungpinang's history can be traced to the early 3rd century, when it flourished as a trading post on the India–China trade route. [[Srivijaya]], a Sumatra-based empire which nurtured trade with China, came to dominate much of the Malay archipelago from the 7th to 13th centuries. It declined with the rise of piracy in the region, and by the 12th century [[Bintan Island]] became known by the Chinese as "Pirate Island".

According to the [[Malay Annals]], a Srivijaya prince named [[Sang Nila Utama|Seri Teri Buana]], fleeing from the sacking of [[Palembang]], stayed on Bintan for several years, gathering his strength before founding the [[Kingdom of Singapura]] (Singapore). A century later, it too was sacked by rival powers, and its king founded a new city at Malacca. The [[Malacca Sultanate]] (1400–1511) became one of the great empires of the region, its territories including the [[Riau Archipelago]]. Malacca was captured by the Portuguese in 1511, and the exiled [[Mahmud Shah of Malacca|Sultan Mahmud Shah]] established his capital at Bintan, from which he organized attacks and blockades against the Portuguese. In 1526, after a number of attempts to suppress the Malay forces, the Portuguese razed Bintan to the ground.

===Johor Sultanate===
[[Alauddin Riayat Shah II of Johor|Alauddin Riayat Shah II]], a son of Mahmud Shah, established the [[Johor Sultanate]] in 1528. Former-Malaccan territories were quickly brought under Johor's influence, including Bintan, where an important trading port called Bandar Riau was opened. As it prospered and a war with the [[Jambi Sultanate]] threatened Johor in 1722, the capital was moved to Riau, which became a centre of trade and Islamic studies much as Malacca had been.

A conflict with the Dutch, who had taken Malacca from the Portuguese, culminated with a Dutch fleet of 13 vessels besieging and attacking Riau. On 6 January 1784, they were met in battle by Malay and [[Bugis]] forces, and repelled with the destruction of the Dutch command ship ''Malaka's Wal Faren''. Malay forces continued to harass the Dutch, and blockaded Malacca, but a defeat and succession crisis shifted power against them. The capital was moved from Riau to Lingga in 1788. The change of capitals has led to the Johor Sultanate sometimes being called the Johor–Riau–Lingga Empire.

The British gained control of Malacca from the Dutch in 1795. Attempting to increase their influence over the Strait of Malacca, the two powers each crowned a different candidate as Sultan of Johor–Riau during a succession crisis (1812–1818). This led to the partition of Johor–Riau under the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]], which placed the territory south of the strait under Dutch control as the [[Riau–Lingga Sultanate]].

===Dutch colony and independence===

On 11 February 1911, the Dutch deposed the sultan for defying the colonial masters, and officially annexed the sultanate which was then administered from Tanjungpinang as the [[Riau Residency]] of the Dutch East Indies.  A military base was also constructed at Tanjungpinang.

During World War II, the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupiers]] made Tanjungpinang the government centre for the Riau Islands.  Control returned to the Dutch following the Japanese surrender, and the Dutch officially withdrew in 1950. Riau became one of the last territories merged into [[Indonesia]], known as the ''daerah-daerah pulihan'' (recovered regions). Tanjungpinang briefly became the capital of [[Riau Province]], until the capital was moved to [[Pekanbaru]] in 1960. A law passed in 2001 defined Tanjungpinang as an autonomous city with effect from 21 June 2001 (separate from [[Bintan Regency]], of which it was previously a part), and it became the capital of Riau Islands Province when that province was created in 2002, becoming its second city (after [[Batam]], formed as an independent city in 1999).

==Administration==
The city (which is administratively separate from [[Bintan Regency]]) is divided into four [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010,<ref name="Statistik">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020 Censuses,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as of mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Tanjungpinang Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.2172)</ref>
