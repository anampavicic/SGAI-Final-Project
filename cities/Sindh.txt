'''Sindh''' ({{IPAc-en|'|s|ɪ|n|d}} {{respell|SIND}}; {{Langx|sd|{{Naskh|سِنْڌ}}}}; {{langx|ur|{{nq|سِنْدھ}}}}, {{IPA-ur|sɪndʱə|pron}}; abbr. '''SD''', historically romanized as '''[[Sind (caliphal province)|Sind]]''') is a [[Administrative units of Pakistan|province]] of [[Pakistan]]. Located in the [[Geography of Pakistan|southeastern region]] of the country, Sindh is the third-largest province of Pakistan by land area and the [[Demographics of Pakistan|second-largest province by population]] after [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. It is bordered by the [[Pakistani provinces]] of [[Balochistan, Pakistan|Balochistan]] to the west and north-west and [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]] to the north. It shares an [[India-Pakistan border|International border]] with the [[Indian states]] of [[Gujarat]] and [[Rajasthan]] to the east; it is also bounded by the [[Arabian Sea]] to the south. Sindh's landscape consists mostly of [[alluvial plain]]s flanking the [[Indus River]], the [[Thar Desert of Sindh]] in the eastern portion of the province along the [[India–Pakistan border|international border with India]], and the [[Kirthar Mountains]] in the western portion of the province.

The [[economy of Sindh]] is the second largest in Pakistan after the [[province of Punjab]]; its provincial capital [[Karachi]] is the [[List of cities in Pakistan by population|most populous city in the country]] as well as its main financial hub. Sindh is home to a large portion of [[Industry of Pakistan|Pakistan's industrial sector]] and contains two of the country's busiest commercial seaports: [[Port Qasim]] and the [[Port of Karachi]]. The remainder of Sindh consists of an [[Agriculture in Pakistan|agriculture]]-based economy and produces fruits, consumer items and vegetables for other parts of the country.<ref name="The Nation, 2014">{{cite news|last1=Staff reporter|title=Sindh must exploit potential for fruit production|url=http://nation.com.pk/business/09-Mar-2014/sindh-must-exploit-potential-for-fruit-production|access-date=29 May 2015|agency=The Nation|publisher=The Nation, 2014|date=9 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="SALU Press">{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/1934949|title=Dates in Sindh|journal=Proceedings of the International Dates Seminar|last2=Saud|first2=Adila A.|publisher=SALU Press|last1=Markhand|first1=Ghulam Sarwar|access-date=29 May 2015}}</ref><ref name="Dawn News, 2007">{{cite news|last1=Editorial|title=How to grow Bananas|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/264225/how-to-grow-bananas|access-date=29 May 2015|agency=Dawn News|publisher=Dawn News, 2007|date=3 September 2007}}</ref>

The [[Greeks]] who conquered Sindh in 325 BCE under the command of [[Alexander the Great]] referred to the [[Indus River]] as ''[[wikt:Ἰνδός#Ancient Greek|Indós]]'', hence the modern ''Indus''. The ancient [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] referred to everything east of the river Indus as ''hind''.<ref name="Now or Never">{{cite web|author=Choudhary Rahmat Ali|date=28 January 1933|title=Now or Never.

Sindh and surrounding areas contain the ruins of the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. There are remnants of thousand-year-old cities and structures, with a notable example in Sindh being that of [[Mohenjo-daro|Mohenjo Daro]]. Built around 2500 BCE, it was one of the largest settlements of the ancient Indus civilization, with features such as standardized bricks, street grids, and covered sewerage systems.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Sanyal, Sanjeev |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/855957425 |title=Land of the seven rivers : a brief history of India's geography |date=10 July 2013 |publisher=Penguin Books |isbn=978-0-14-342093-4 |oclc=855957425}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Archaeological Ruins at Moanjodaro |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/138 |access-date=September 6, 2014 |website=The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) website}}</ref> It was one of the world's earliest major [[City|cities]], contemporaneous with the civilizations of [[ancient Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Minoan civilization|Minoan Crete]], and [[Caral-Supe civilization|Caral-Supe]].

"The story in Harappan India was somewhat different (see Figure 111.3). The Bronze Age village and urban societies of the Indus Valley are some-thing of an anomaly, in that archaeologists have found little indication of local defense and regional warfare. It would seem that the bountiful monsoon rainfall of the Early to Mid-Holocene had forged a condition of plenty for all, and that competitive energies were channeled into commerce rather than conflict. Scholars have long argued that these rains shaped the origins of the urban Harappan societies, which emerged from Neolithic villages around 2600 BCE. It now appears that this rainfall began to slowly taper off in the third millennium, at just the point that the Harappan cities began to develop. Thus it seems that this "first urbanisation" in South Asia was the initial response of the Indus Valley peoples to the beginning of Late Holocene aridification. These cities were maintained for 300 to 400 years and then gradually abandoned as the Harappan peoples resettled in scattered villages in the eastern range of their territories, into the Punjab and the Ganges Valley....' 17 (footnote):<br />

Later, desire for a separate administrative status for Sindh grew. At the annual session of the Indian National Congress in 1913, a Sindhi Hindu put forward the demand for Sindh's separation from the Bombay Presidency on the grounds of Sindh's unique cultural character.

Although Sindh had a cleaner record of communal harmony than other parts of India, the province's Muslim elite and emerging Muslim middle class demanded separation of Sindh from Bombay Presidency as a safeguard for their own interests.

==== Partition (1947) ====
In 1947, violence did not constitute a major part of the Sindhi partition experience, unlike in Punjab. There were very few incidents of violence on Sindh, in part due to the Sufi-influenced culture of religious tolerance and in part that Sindh was not divided and was instead made part of Pakistan in its entirety. Sindhi Hindus who left generally did so out of a fear of persecution, rather than persecution itself, because of the arrival of Muslim refugees from India. Sindhi Hindus differentiated between the local Sindhi Muslims and the migrant Muslims from India. A large number of Sindhi Hindus travelled to India by sea, to the ports of Bombay, Porbandar, Veraval and Okha.<ref>Priya Kumar & Rita Kothari (2016) Sindh, 1947 and Beyond, ''South Asia: Journal of South Asian Studies'', 39:4, 776–777, DOI: 10.1080/00856401.2016.1244752</ref>

Over time, the majority of the population in Sindh converted to Islam, especially in rural areas. Today, Muslims make up 90% of the population, and are more dominant in urban than rural areas. Islam in Sindh has a strong Sufi ethos with numerous Muslim saints and mystics, such as the Sufi poet [[Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai]], having lived in Sindh historically.

== Geography and nature ==
[[File:Manora Beach 1100641.JPG|thumb|left|Peninsula of Manora]]
[[File:Blackbuck1-Kirthar National Park.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sindh ibex]] in [[Kirthar National Park]]]]
Sindh is in the western corner of South Asia, bordering the [[Iranian plateau]] in the west. Geographically it is the third largest province of Pakistan, stretching about {{convert|579|km}} from north to south and {{convert|442|km}} (extreme) or {{convert|281|km}} (average) from east to west, with an area of {{convert|140915|km2|sqmi}} of Pakistani territory. Sindh is bounded by the [[Thar Desert]] to the east, the [[Kirthar Mountains]] to the west and the [[Arabian Sea]] and [[Rann of Kutch]] to the south. In the centre is a fertile plain along the [[Indus River]].

Sindh is divided into three main geographical regions: ''Siro'' ("upper country"), aka Upper Sindh, which is above [[Sehwan]]; ''Vicholo'' ("middle country"), or Middle Sindh, from Sehwan to [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]; and ''Lāṟu'' ("sloping, descending country"), or Lower Sindh, mostly consisting of the [[Indus Delta]] below Hyderabad.<ref name="Haig 1894">{{cite book |last1=Haig |first1=Malcolm Robert |title=The Indus Delta Country: A Memoir, Chiefly on Its Ancient Geography and History |date=1894 |publisher=Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co. |location=London |page=1 |url=https://archive.org/details/indusdeltacount00haiggoog |access-date=29 January 2022}}</ref>

=== Flora ===
[[File:Sindhri Mango.JPG|alt=Sindhri mangoes is among top 10 mango varieties in the world|thumb|[[Sindhri]] is among top 10 [[mango varieties]] in the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.khaleejtimes.com/nation/dubai/queen-of-mangoes-sindhri-from-pakistan-in-uae|title=Queen of Mangoes: Sindhri from Pakistan now in UAE|last=Menon|first=Sunita|website=Khaleej Times|access-date=2019-09-22}}</ref>]]
The province is mostly arid with scant vegetation except for the irrigated Indus Valley. The dwarf palm, ''Acacia rupestris'' (kher), and ''[[Tecomella undulata]]'' ([[Rohida|lohirro]]) trees are typical of the western hill region. In the Indus valley, the ''[[Acacia nilotica]]'' (babul) (babbur) is the most dominant and occurs in thick forests along the Indus banks. The ''[[Azadirachta indica]]'' (neem) (nim), ''Zizyphys vulgaris'' (bir) (ber), ''Tamarix orientalis'' (jujuba lai) and ''[[Capparis aphylla]]'' (kirir) are among the more common trees.

Mango, date palms and the more recently introduced banana, guava, orange and [[chiku]] are the typical fruit-bearing trees. The coastal strip and the creeks abound in semi-aquatic and aquatic plants and the inshore Indus delta islands have forests of ''Avicennia tomentosa'' (timmer) and ''[[Ceriops tagal|Ceriops candolleana]]'' (chaunir) trees. Water lilies grow in abundance in the numerous lake and ponds, particularly in the lower Sindh region.{{Citation needed|date=September 2020}}

=== Fauna ===
{{Main|Fauna of Sindh}}
[[File:Schnabeldelphin-drawing.jpg|thumb|right|Indus river dolphin]]
Among the wild animals, the [[Sindh ibex]] (sareh), [[blackbuck]], wild sheep ([[Urial]] or gadh) and [[Asian black bear|wild bear]] are found in the western rocky range. The [[leopard]] is now rare and the [[Asiatic cheetah]] extinct. The [[Fishing cat|Pirrang]] (large tiger cat or fishing cat) of the eastern desert region is also disappearing. [[Chinkara|Deer]] occur in the lower rocky plains and in the eastern region, as do the [[Striped hyena]] (charakh), [[jackal]], [[fox]], [[porcupine]], [[mongoose|common gray mongoose]] and [[hedgehog]]. The Sindhi phekari, red lynx or Caracal cat, is found in some areas. Phartho (hog deer) and wild bear occur, particularly in the central inundation belt. There are bats, lizards and reptiles, including the cobra, lundi (viper) and the mysterious Sindh [[krait]] of the Thar region, which is supposed to suck the victim's breath in his sleep.
Some unusual sightings of Asian cheetah occurred in 2003 near the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] border in [[Kirthar Mountains]]. The rare [[Houbara bustard]] finds Sindh's warm climate suitable to rest and mate. Unfortunately, it is hunted by locals and foreigners.

Crocodiles are rare and inhabit only the backwaters of the Indus, eastern Nara channel and Karachi backwater. Besides a large variety of marine fish, the plumbeous dolphin, the beaked dolphin, rorqual or blue whale and skates frequent the seas along the Sindh coast. The Pallo (Sable fish), a marine fish, ascends the Indus annually from February to April to spawn. The [[Indus river dolphin]] is among the most endangered species in Pakistan and is found in the part of the Indus river in northern Sindh. [[Indian hog deer|Hog deer]] and [[Asian black bear|wild bear]] occur, particularly in the central inundation belt.

Although Sindh has a [[semi arid]] climate, through its coastal and riverine forests, its huge fresh water lakes and mountains and deserts, Sindh supports a large amount of varied wildlife. Due to the semi-arid [[climate of Sindh]] the left out forests support an average population of jackals and snakes. The [[national parks]] established by the Government of Pakistan in collaboration with many organizations such as [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] and [[Sindh Wildlife Department]] support a huge variety of animals and birds. The [[Kirthar National Park]] in the Kirthar range spreads over more than 3000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of desert, stunted tree forests and a lake. The KNP supports [[Sindh ibex]], [[wild sheep]] (urial) and [[Asian black bear|black bear]] along with the rare leopard. There are also occasional sightings of The Sindhi phekari, ped lynx or Caracal cat. There is a project to introduce [[tiger]]s and [[Asian elephant]]s too in KNP near the huge Hub Dam Lake. Between July and November when the [[monsoon]] winds blow onshore from the ocean, giant [[olive ridley]] turtles lay their eggs along the seaward side. The turtles are protected species. After the mothers lay and leave them buried under the sands the SWD and WWF officials take the eggs and protect them until they are hatched to keep them from predators.

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of Sindh}}
[[File:Ayub.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Lansdowne Railway Bridge]]
Sindh lies in a [[tropical]] to [[subtropical]] region; it is hot in the summer and mild to warm in winter. Temperatures frequently rise above {{convert|46|°C|°F|abbr=on|lk=on}} between May and August, and the minimum average temperature of {{convert|2|°C|°F|abbr=on}} occurs during December and January in the northern and higher elevated regions. The annual rainfall averages about seven inches, falling mainly during July and August. The southwest monsoon wind begins in mid-February and continues until the end of September, whereas the cool northerly wind blows during the winter months from October to January.

Sindh lies between the two [[monsoon]]s—the southwest monsoon from the Indian Ocean and the northeast or retreating monsoon, deflected towards it by the [[Himalayas|Himalayan mountains]]—and escapes the influence of both. The region's scarcity of rainfall is compensated by the inundation of the Indus twice a year, caused by the spring and summer melting of Himalayan snow and by rainfall in the monsoon season.

Sindh is divided into three climatic regions: Siro (the upper region, centred on [[Jacobabad]]), Wicholo (the middle region, centred on [[Hyderabad, Sindh|Hyderabad]]), and Lar (the lower region, centred on [[Karachi]]). The [[thermal equator]] passes through upper Sindh, where the air is generally very dry. Central Sindh's temperatures are generally lower than those of upper Sindh but higher than those of lower Sindh. Dry hot days and cool nights are typical during the summer. Central Sindh's maximum temperature typically reaches {{convert|43|-|44|C|F}}. Lower Sindh has a damper and humid maritime climate affected by the southwestern winds in summer and northeastern winds in winter, with lower [[rainfall]] than Central Sindh. Lower Sindh's maximum temperature reaches about {{convert|35|-|38|C|F}}. In the Kirthar range at {{convert|1800|m|ft|abbr=on}} and higher at [[Gorakh Hill]] and other peaks in [[Dadu District]], temperatures near freezing have been recorded and brief snowfall is received in the winters.

In July 2011, following excessive [[July 2011 Karachi target killings|violence in the city of Karachi]] and after the political split between the ruling PPP and the majority party in Sindh, the MQM and after the resignation of the MQM Governor of Sindh, PPP and the Government of Sindh decided to restore the commissionerate system in the province. As a consequence, the five divisions of Sindh were restored – namely Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Mirpurkhas and Larkana with their respective districts. Subsequently, a new division was added in Sindh, the Nawab Shah/Shaheed Benazirabad division.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nation.com.pk/12-Jul-2011/commissioners-dcs-posted-in-sindh |title=Commissioners, DCs posted in Sindh |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713092405/http://nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/12-Jul-2011/Commissioners-DCs-posted-in-Sindh |first1=Ramzan |last1=Chandio |website=The Nation |date=July 12, 2011 |archive-date=2011-07-13 }}</ref>

The work of Sindhi artisans was sold in ancient markets of Damascus, Baghdad, Basra, Istanbul, Cairo and Samarkand. Referring to the lacquer work on wood locally known as Jandi, T. Posten (an English traveller who visited Sindh in the early 19th century) asserted that the articles of Hala could be compared with exquisite specimens of China. Technological improvements such as the spinning wheel ([[Charkha (spinning wheel)|charkha]]) and treadle (pai-chah) in the weaver's loom were gradually introduced and the processes of designing, dyeing and printing by block were refined. The refined, lightweight, colourful, washable fabrics from Hala became a luxury for people used to the woollens and linens of the age.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wishwebdesign.com/dgaewm/otherinfo/Cultural-Heritage/542/533|title=Cultural Heritage|website=wishwebdesign.com =|access-date=September 6, 2014|archive-date=5 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105234434/http://www.wishwebdesign.com/dgaewm/otherinfo/Cultural-Heritage/542/533|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Non-governmental organisations (NGOs) such as the World Wildlife Fund, Pakistan, play an important role to promote the culture of Sindh. They provide training to women artisans in Sindh so they get a source of income. They promote their products under the name of "Crafts Forever". Many women in rural Sindh are skilled in the production of caps. Sindhi caps are manufactured commercially on a small scale at New Saeedabad and Hala New. Sindhi people began celebrating Sindhi Topi Day on 6 December 2009, to preserve the historical culture of Sindh by wearing Ajrak and Sindhi topi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/provinces/13+sindh+celebrates+first+ever+sindhi+topi+day-za-04|title=Sindh celebrates first ever 'Sindhi Topi Day'|access-date=6 December 2009|archive-date=8 December 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208224829/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/provinces/13+sindh+celebrates+first+ever+sindhi+topi+day-za-04|url-status=dead}}</ref>
