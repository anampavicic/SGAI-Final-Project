'''East Kalimantan''' ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: {{audio|Kalimantan Timur (province).ogg|''Kalimantan Timur''|help=no}}) is a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] of [[Indonesia]]. Its territory comprises the eastern portion of [[Borneo]]/[[Kalimantan]]. It had a population of about 3.03 million at the 2010 census (within the current boundary),<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> 3.42 million at the 2015 census, and 3.766 million at the 2020 census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 4,030,488.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Provinsi Kalimantan Timur Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.64)</ref> Its capital is the city of [[Samarinda]].

East Kalimantan has a total area of {{convert|127346.92|km2|sqmi}}<ref>revised area following the removal of Tarakan city and four regencies to form the new [[North Kalimantan]] province in 2012, and subsequently amended by BPS.</ref> and is the second [[Provinces of Indonesia|least densely populated]] province in [[Kalimantan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bps.go.id/65tahun/SP2010_agregat_data_perProvinsi.pdf |title=Hasil Sensus Penduduk 2010 Data Agregat Per Provinsi |work=Badan Pusat Statistik |author=Badan Pusat Statistik |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113144717/http://www.bps.go.id/65tahun/SP2010_agregat_data_perProvinsi.pdf |archive-date=2010-11-13 }}</ref> The majority of the region shares a maritime border to the east with [[West Sulawesi]] and [[Central Sulawesi]]; its [[Cape Mangkalihat]] separates the [[Makassar Strait]] from the [[Celebes Sea]]. Its former northernmost region was split off on 25 October 2012 and is now [[North Kalimantan]]; meanwhile it still shares land border to the west with [[West Kalimantan]] and [[Central Kalimantan]]; to its south, East Kalimantan borders [[South Kalimantan]]. The province bordered [[Sabah]] before the split, but still borders [[Sarawak]], Malaysia through [[Mahakam Ulu Regency]].

On 11 January 2013, the existing West Kutai Regency was split in two, with the northwesternmost five districts forming a new [[Mahakam Ulu Regency]]. East Kalimantan is now divided into seven [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] and three cities. Akmal Malik is the current acting [[governor of East Kalimantan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kaltimprov.go.id/kaltim.php?page=struktur |title=Organisasi |publisher=Kaltimprov.go.id |access-date=13 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115110456/http://kaltimprov.go.id/kaltim.php?page=struktur |archive-date=15 January 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== New national capital ==
{{See also|Nusantara (city)}}
The province will host the future [[capital city]] of Indonesia that will be built on the borders of [[Kutai Kartanegara]] and [[Penajam North Paser]] Regencies. The [[Capital of Indonesia|future capital]] is to be named Nusantara,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/asia/indonesia-new-capital-name-nusantara-east-kalimantan-2440426|title=Indonesia minister announces name of new national capital in eastern Kalimantan|website=Channel News Asia}}</ref> with construction originally projected to start in 2020, and intended to conclude in 2024. However, at a hearing before Committee V of Indonesia's House of Representatives on 9 June 2020, a government representative asserted that the government had not allocated the 2022 budget for the project (for 2022, the ministry proposed a budget worth over 100.46 trillion rupiah - over 7 billion US$ - a steep reduction from the figure of 149.81 trillion rupiah in 2021). Earlier, the National Planning Development Authority had said that the total sum needed to move the capital from its current location in Jakarta to East Kalimantan province amounted to 486 trillion rupiah, of which 265.2 trillion will be mobilised through the public-private partnership (PPP), 127.3 trillion from private special funds, and 93.5 trillion from the state budget. But the Ministry of Finance said that the government switched its priorities to mitigating the effect of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]. The ministry announced that it had not allocated budget for the new capital project. Nevertheless, the new national capital was formally inaugurated in August 2024.

=== 4th century to 17th century ===
[[Image:kutai Prasasti of Mulawarman.JPG|frame|right|The ancient [[Yūpa#Yūpa inscription in Indonesia|Yūpa inscription]] of [[Mulavarman]], king of [[Kutai|Kutai Martadipura]] dating back to the 4th century CE discovered in present [[Muara Kaman]] area, [[Kutai Kartanegara Regency]]]]
East Kalimantan is home to several kingdoms, such as the first and oldest Hindu kingdom of Indonesia, the [[Kutai#History|Kingdom of Kutai Martadipura]] founded in the 4th century CE, it was then succeeded by the [[Kutai#Sultanate of Kutai Kartanegara|Sultanate of Kutai ing Martadipura]] in the 14th century CE. Other kingdoms are also located in East Kalimantan such as the Sultanate of Pasir. East Kalimantan region include Pasir, Kutai, Berau and also Karasikan (Buranun / pre-Sultanate of Sulu) claimed as conquered territory Suryanata Maharaja, the governor of Majapahit in the State Dipa (which is located in the Great Temple in Amuntai) until 1620 in the Sultanate of Banjar. However, in the Chinese History Annals, Ming shi 明史, at 1417, some parts of the eastern Kalimantan was recorded as a kingdom under the rule of the Philippine kingdom of then Hindu [[Sulu Sultanate|Sulu]] as Kalimantan was ruled by a Sulu monarch named Mahalatu Gelamading (Maharaja Klainbantangan) where his title, Klainbantangan, in Chinese rendering, was named after his territory [[Kalimantan]]. At this point in time, Sulu had rebelled against Majapahit rule and had invaded Northeast and East Borneo until the very territory of Kalimantan.<ref>[https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/228735802.pdf Reading Song-Ming Records on the Pre-colonial History of the Philippines] By Wang Zhenping Page 258.</ref> Between the years 1620–1624, kingdoms in East Kalimantan turned into an area influence of the Sultanate of Sultan Alauddin Makassar, before the Bungaya agreement. According to the Hikayat Banjar, the Sultan of Makassar never borrowed land for trade covers an area east and southeast of Borneo to the Sultan Mustain Billah of Banjar when Kiai Martasura sent to Makassar and entered into an agreement with the Sultan Tallo I Mangngadaccinna Daeng I Ba'le 'Sultan Mahmud Karaeng Pattingalloang, which became Mangkubumi and principal advisor to the Sultan Muhammad Said, king of Gowa in 1638–1654 and also in-law of Sultan Hasanuddin, which will make the East Kalimantan region as a place to trade for the Sultanate of Makassar (Gowa-Tallo), since that began to arrive people from South Sulawesi. However, based on the agreement between the Sultanate of Banjar and the Dutch East India Company (VOC) in 1635, VOC help Banjar restore lands in East Kalimantan into spheres of influence of the Sultanate of Banjar. It is embodied in the Bungaya agreement, that the Sultanate of Makassar are not allowed to trade up to the east and the north Borneo.

=== 18th century to 20th century ===
In accordance with treaties, on January 1, 1817, Sultan Sulaiman of Banjar handed East Kalimantan, Central Kalimantan, part of West and South Kalimantan (including Banjarmasin) over to the Dutch East Indies. On May 4, 1826, Sultan Adam al-wathiq Billah of Banjar reaffirmed the handover of these territories to the Dutch East Indies colonial administration. In 1846, the Dutch began to put a Resident Assistant in East Borneo at Samarinda (now the province of East Kalimantan and the eastern part of South Kalimantan) named H. Von Dewall. East Kalimantan was then part of the [[Dutch East Indies]]. East Kalimantan with its then administrative area was established based on the Law No. 25 of 1956 with the first governor being APT Pranoto.

=== Split of North Kalimantan province ===
[[North Kalimantan]] was formally inaugurated as the 34th province of Indonesia on April 15, 2013. The new province was previously part of East Kalimantan Province.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://koran-jakarta.com/index.php/detail/view01/115158 |title=Provinsi Kalimantan Utara Diresmikan 15 April |date=March 22, 2013}}</ref>

== Geography ==
East Kalimantan Province comprises a land area of 125,336.81 square kilometers and a comprehensive ocean management area of 25,656&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, located between 113°44'E and 119°00'E, and between 2°33'N and 2°25'S. The province is divided into seven regencies (''kabupaten'') and three cities (''kota''), together subdivided into 103 districts (''kecamatan'') and then into 1,026 villages (rural ''desa'' and urban ''kelurahan''). The regencies (with their administrative capitals) and cities are enumerated below. East Kalimantan is one of the main gates to the eastern part of Indonesia. The area is also known as a storehouse of timber and mining, has [[List of rivers of East Kalimantan|hundreds of rivers]] (scattered across almost all regencies and cities) which area the main means of transportation in addition to land transport, with the longest river being the [[Mahakam River|Mahakam]].

East Kalimantan borders [[North Kalimantan]] in the north, [[South Kalimantan]] in the south, [[Central Kalimantan]] in the southwest, and [[West Kalimantan]] and [[Sarawak]] in the east. It touches the [[Celebes Sea]] and the [[Makassar Strait]] in the east, with its large [[Mangkalihat Peninsula]] separating the two. There are hills in almost all districts, and there are numerous lakes. Most lakes are located in the Kutai Regency, with the most extensive lakes, Semayang and Melintang, having an area of 13,000&nbsp;ha and 11,000&nbsp;ha respectively.

Such as the climate of Indonesia in general, East Kalimantan tropical climate and has two seasons, dry and rainy seasons. The dry season usually occurs in May to October, while the rainy season in November to April. This situation continued every year interspersed with transitional season in certain months. Moreover, because of its location on the equator, the climate in East Kalimantan are also affected by wind monsoon, monsoon wind is November–April west and east monsoon winds from May to October. In recent years, the situation in East Kalimantan season is sometimes erratic. In the months that it is supposed to rain, there is no rain at all, or vice versa in the months that should be dry it rains for a much longer time.

==== Temperature and humidity ====
Temperatures somewhere high and low are determined by the area of the ocean surface and the distance from the beach. In general, East Kalimantan hot climates with temperatures in 2013 ranged from 21.6&nbsp;°C in Berau October to 35.6&nbsp;°C in Berau in September. Aside from being a tropical area with extensive forests, in 2013 the average humidity between 83 and 87 percent of East Kalimantan. The lowest air humidity observed by the meteorological station Samarinda happens in a few months with 82 percent humidity. While the highest occurred in Berau in February with 91 percent humidity.

==== Rainfall and wind conditions ====
Rainfall in East Kalimantan region varies by month and location of monitoring stations. Average highest rainfall recorded at the Meteorological Station Berau amounted to 245.1&nbsp;mm and the lowest for the year 2013 was recorded at the Meteorological Station Samarinda is 237.8&nbsp;mm. At some monitoring stations monitor wind conditions in East Kalimantan in 2013. Observations show that wind speeds between 3 and 4 knots.

[[File:Prov. Kalimantan Timur.jpg|thumb|Map of regencies and cities]]
When it was first created, East Kalimantan province was composed of four [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] (''kabupaten'') - '''Paser''' (spelt ''Pasir'' until 2007), '''Kutai''' (renamed as '''Kutai Kartanegara''' in 2002), '''Berau''' and '''Bulungan''' - and two cities (''kota'') - '''Balikpapan''' and '''Samarinda'''. On 8 October 1997, a third city - '''Tarakan''' - was created from part of Bulungan Regency. On 4 October 1999 a fourth city  - '''Bontang''' - was created from part of Kutai Regency, while four new regencies were created - '''Malinau''' and '''Nunukan''' from parts of Bulungan Regency, and '''East Kutai''' and '''West Kutai''' from the remaining parts of Kutai Regency (which ceased to exist). Two further regencies were set up - '''Penajam North Paser''' from part of Pasir Regency on 10 April 2002, and '''Tana Tidung''' from part of Bulungan Regency on 17 July 2007. By early 2012 therefore, East Kalimantan was divided into ten [[Regencies of Indonesia|regencies]] and four cities. 

On 22 October 2012, the Indonesian House of Representatives agreed to the creation of a new province out of the four most northerly of the Regencies in East Kalimantan, namely [[Bulungan Regency|Bulungan]], [[Malinau Regency|Malinau]], [[Nunukan Regency|Nunukan]] and [[Tana Tidung Regency|Tana Tidung]], together with one city, [[Tarakan, North Kalimantan|Tarakan]]. Accordingly, these were split off to form the new province of [[North Kalimantan]] on 25 October 2012. The totals below have been adjusted to take account of the removal of [[Tarakan, North Kalimantan|Tarakan City]] and four regencies.

The existing West Kutai Regency was then split into two on 14 December 2012, with the northern districts split off to form the new '''Mahakam Ulu''' Regency, thus leaving the following seven regencies and three cities to comprise the reduced East Kalimantan. These are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as at mid 2022.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2023">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2023, ''Provinsi Kalimantan Timur Dalam Angka 2023'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.64)</ref>

The most populous ethnic group in East Kalimantan is the Javanese (29.55%) who are spread in almost all regions, especially the transmigration areas to urban areas. The second largest ethnic group is Bugis (18.26%), which occupy many coastal areas and urban areas. The third largest ethnicity is Banjar (13.94%) who are quite dominant in the city of Samarinda and Balikpapan. East Kalimantan is a major destination of migrants from Jawa, Sulawesi and South Kalimantan.With population of approximately 3.859 million, and area of 127,347 km<sup>2</sup>, the province is considered sparsely populated.

The fourth largest group is the Dayak (9.91%), which occupies the interior part of the province. Kutai (9.21%) which inhabit Kutai Kartanegara, East Kutai and West Kutai, was fifth. In the sixth to ten consecutively are Toraja (1.16%), Paser (1.89%), Sunda (1.59%), Madura (1.24%) and Auto Buton (1.25%), and the rest are other groups from various regions in Indonesia.

=== Language ===
People in East Kalimantan generally use Indonesian in official purposes and [[Banjarese language|Banjarese]] for inter-ethnic communication. Due to the large number of Banjarese people in the province, their language became the main lingua franca especially in cities like Samarinda and Balikpapan. Besides Banjarese, there is a significant presence of [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Buginese language|Buginese]] speakers as well, due to the large migration of Javanese and Buginese people into the region.

Other languages spoken in East Kalimantan is [[Kutai Malay]] (a distinct Malay variety closely related but distinct from Banjarese), Paser (related to [[Lawangan language|Lawangan]]), [[Tidung language|Tidung]], [[Berau Malay]], Tunjung, [[Bahau language|Bahau]], [[Lun Bawang language|Modang Lundayeh]] and more others. However, Kutai, Paser, and [[Kenyah languages]] are considered under the threat of extinction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://pusaranmedia.com/read/19401/tiga-dari-16-bahasa-daerah-di-kaltim-nyaris-punah-satu-diantaranya-bahasa-paser|title=Tiga dari 16 Bahasa Daerah di Kaltim Nyaris Punah, Satu Diantaranya Bahasa Paser|website=pusaranmedia.com|access-date=2023-09-22}}</ref>
