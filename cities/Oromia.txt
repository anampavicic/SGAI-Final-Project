==History==
The Oromo people are one of the oldest [[Cushitic people]]s inhabiting the [[Horn of Africa]]. There is still no reliable estimate of the history of their settlement in the region, however, many indications suggest that they have been living in the north of [[Kenya]] and south-east Ethiopia for more than 7,000 years, until the [[Oromo migrations|great expansion in 1520]] when they expanded to the south-west and some areas in the north.{{Citation needed|date=May 2023}}

In the early 1990s, the [[Ethiopian Democratic People's Republic]] began to [[Ethiopian Civil War#1990s|lose its control over Ethiopia]]. The OLF failed to maintain strong alliances with the other two rebel groups at the time: the [[Eritrean People's Liberation Front]] (EPLF) and the [[Tigray People's Liberation Front]] (TPLF).<ref name="auto">{{citation|title=30 YEARS OF WAR AND FAMINE IN ETHIOPIA |url=https://www.hrw.org/sites/default/files/reports/Ethiopia919.pdf|date=September 1991}}</ref> In 1990, the TPLF created an umbrella organization for several rebel groups in Ethiopia, the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF).

On 28 May 1991, the EPRDF seized power and established a [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia|transitional government]]. The EPRDF and the OLF pledged to work together in the new government; however, they were largely unable to cooperate, as the OLF saw the OPDO as an EPRDF ploy to limit their influence.<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{citation|url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6a9e3a.html|title=Ethiopia: Accountability past and present: Human rights in transition|date=1 April 1995}}</ref> In 1992, the OLF announced that it was withdrawing from the transitional government because of "harassment and [the]assassinations of its members".

Oromia includes the former [[Arsi Province]] along with portions of the former [[Bale Province, Ethiopia|Bale]], [[Illubabor Province|Illubabor]], [[Kaffa Province, Ethiopia|Kaffa]], [[Shewa]] and [[Sidamo Province|Sidamo]] provinces.{{citation needed|date=February 2021}} Oromia shares a boundary with almost every region of Ethiopia except for the [[Tigray Region]]. These boundaries have been disputed in a number of cases, most notably between Oromia and the [[Somali Region]]. One attempt to resolve the dispute between the two regions was the October 2004 referendum held in about 420 [[kebele]]s in 12 [[Districts of Ethiopia|districts]] across five zones of the Somali Region. According to the official results of the referendum, about 80% of the disputed areas have fallen under Oromia administration, though there were allegations of [[voting irregularities]] in many of them.<ref>[http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/(httpEnvelopes)/AA0C62769222BE31802570B8005A6F3B?OpenDocument "Somali-Oromo border referendum of December 2004"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430113732/http://www.internal-displacement.org/idmc/website/countries.nsf/%28httpEnvelopes%29/AA0C62769222BE31802570B8005A6F3B?OpenDocument |date=30 April 2009 }}, Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre website (accessed 11 February 2009)</ref> The results led over the following weeks to minorities in these kebeles being pressured to leave. In Oromiya, estimates based on figures given by local district and kebele authorities suggest that 21,520 people have become [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs) in border districts, namely [[Mieso, Oromia (woreda)|Mieso]], [[Doba (woreda)|Doba]], and [[Erer]] in the [[West Hararghe Zone]] and [[East Hararghe Zone]]s. Federal authorities believe that this number may be overstated by as much as 11,000. In Doba, the [[Ethiopian Ministry of Federal Affairs|Ministry of Federal Affairs]] put the number of IDPs at 6,000. There are also more than 2,500 displaced persons in Mieso.<ref>[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20090305231236/http://www.ocha-eth.org/Reports/downloadable/FocusonEthiopiaApril2005.pdf "Regional Overview: Oromia Region", ''Focus on Ethiopia''] (April 2005), p. 5 (accessed 11 February 2009)</ref> In addition, there were reports of people being displaced in the border area of Moyale and Borena zones due to this conflict.<ref>[http://www.ocha-eth.org/Reports/downloadable/FocusonEthiopiaMay2005.pdf "Regional Update: Oromiya", ''Focus on Ethiopia''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305231233/http://www.ocha-eth.org/Reports/downloadable/FocusonEthiopiaMay2005.pdf |date=5 March 2009 }} (May 2005), p. 5 (accessed 11 February 2009)</ref>

===Languages===
{{see also|Oromo language}}
[[Oromo language|Oromo]] is written with Latin characters known as ''Qubee'', only formally adopted in 1991<ref>{{Cite web |title=Afaan Oromo |url=http://www.sas.upenn.edu/African_Studies/Hornet/Afaan_Oromo_19777.html |publisher=[[University of Pennsylvania]], School of African Studies |language=en}}</ref> after various other  Latin-based orthographies had been used previously.

Oromo is one of the official working languages of Ethiopia<ref name="africanews.com">{{cite news |last1=Shaban |first1=Abdurahman |title=One to five: Ethiopia gets four new federal working languages |url=https://www.africanews.com/2020/03/04/one-to-five-ethiopia-gets-four-new-federal-working-languages// |agency=Africa News}}</ref> and is also the working language of several of the states within the Ethiopian federal system including Oromia,<ref name="The world factbook"/> [[Harari Region|Harari]] and [[Dire Dawa]] regional states and of the [[Oromia Zone]] in the [[Amhara Region]]. It is a language of primary education in Oromia, Harari and of the [[Oromia Zone]] in the [[Amhara Region]]. It is used as an internet language for federal websites along with [[Tigrinya language|Tigrinya]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.moh.gov.et/ejcc/|title=ቤት &#124; FMOH|website=moh.gov.et}}</ref>

There are more than 33.8% Oromo speakers in Ethiopia and it is considered the most widely spoken language in Ethiopia.<ref name="The world factbook">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/ethiopia/| title=The world factbook |website=cia.gov| date=22 November 2021 }}</ref> It is also the most widely spoken [[Cushitic language]] and the fourth-most widely spoken [[language of Africa]], after Arabic, [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Swahili language]]s.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p03jqf43 | title=Children's books breathe new life into Oromo language | publisher=BBC}}</ref> Forms of Oromo are spoken as a first language by more than 35 million Oromo people in Ethiopia and by an additional half-million in parts of northern and eastern Kenya.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/oromo-1 |title=Oromo |publisher=Ethnologue |access-date=2016-08-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825174511/https://www.ethnologue.com/subgroups/oromo-1 |archive-date=2016-08-25 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is also spoken by smaller numbers of emigrants in other African countries such as South Africa, Libya, Egypt and Sudan.
Besides first language speakers, a number of members of other ethnicities who are in contact with the Oromo speak it as a second language. See, for example, [[Harari people|Harari]], [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]-speaking [[Bambassi language|Bambassi]] and the [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]]-speaking [[Kwama people|Kwama]] in northwestern, eastern and south Oromia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_country.asp?name=ET |title=Languages of Ethiopia |publisher=Ethnologue |date=1999-02-19 |access-date=2013-08-10}}</ref>
