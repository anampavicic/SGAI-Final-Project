The '''Autonomous Republic of Crimea''' is an [[administrative divisions of Ukraine|administrative division of Ukraine]] encompassing most of [[Crimea]] that was [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|unilaterally annexed]] by [[Russia]] in 2014.

The Autonomous Republic of Crimea is an autonomous [[parliamentary republic]] within Ukraine<ref name="BBCprofileCrimea"/> and was governed by the [[Constitution of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea|Constitution of Crimea]] in accordance with the laws of Ukraine. The capital and administrative seat of the republic's government is the city of [[Simferopol]], located in the centre of the peninsula. Crimea's area is {{convert|26200|km2|sqmi}} and its population was 1,973,185 as of 2007. These figures do not include the area and population of the City of [[Sevastopol]] (2007 population: 379,200), which is administratively separate from the autonomous republic.

==Background==
{{main|History of Crimea}}

The Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic was established as part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] in 1921, with the latter joining with other republics to form the Soviet Union. Following the end of Nazi occupation during World War II, [[Deportation of the Crimean Tatars|indigenous Crimean Tatars were forcibly deported]] and the autonomous republic was abolished in 1945, replaced with an oblast-level jurisdiction. In 1954, [[Crimea Oblast]] was transferred to the jurisdiction of the [[Ukrainian SSR]]. Shortly prior to the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Crimea was granted the status of Autonomous Republic by the [[Verkhovna Rada|Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian SSR]] following a state-sanctioned [[1991 Crimean sovereignty referendum|referendum]] held on January 20, 1991. When [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|Ukraine became independent]], Crimea remained a republic within the country, leading to tensions between [[Russia]] and Ukraine as the [[Black Sea Fleet]] was based on the peninsula.

==History==
===Post-Soviet years===
Since Ukrainian independence, more than 250,000 [[Crimean Tatars]] have returned and integrated into the region.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Крымские репатрианты: депортация, возвращение и обустройство|last=Gabrielyan|first=Oleg|publisher=Amena|year=1998|pages=321|language=ru}}</ref>

Between 1992 and 1995, a struggle about the division of powers between the Crimean and Ukrainian authorities ensued. On 26 February, [[Verkhovna Rada of Crimea|the Crimean parliament]]<!-- in 1992-1995 this name, it was a big conflict point about the name when --> renamed the ASSR the [[Republic of Crimea (1992-1995)|Republic of Crimea]].

In October 1993, the Crimean parliament established the post of [[president of Crimea]]. Tensions rose in 1994 with election of separatist leader [[Yury Meshkov]] as Crimean president.

===Formation of the autonomous republic===
Following the ratification of the May 1997 [[Russian–Ukrainian Friendship Treaty]], in which Russia recognized Ukraine's borders and sovereignty over Crimea, international tensions slowly eased. However, in 2006, [[2006 anti-NATO protests in Feodosia|anti-NATO protests]] broke out on the peninsula.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jun/08/russia.nickpatonwalsh Russia tells Ukraine to stay out of Nato], [[The Guardian]] (8 June 2006)</ref> In September 2008, the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Ukraine)|Ukrainian foreign minister]] [[Volodymyr Ohryzko]] accused Russia of giving out [[Russian passport]]s to the population in Crimea and described it as a "real problem" given Russia's declared policy of military intervention abroad to protect Russian citizens.<ref>[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j57jsvObBZruGm0n7HhUA7rCG7nA Cheney urges divided Ukraine to unite against Russia 'threat] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521100144/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5j57jsvObBZruGm0n7HhUA7rCG7nA |date=21 May 2011}}.
