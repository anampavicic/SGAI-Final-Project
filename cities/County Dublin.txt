The [[List of Irish counties by area|third smallest]] county by land area, Dublin is bordered by [[County Meath|Meath]] to the west and north, [[County Kildare|Kildare]] to the west, [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]] to the south and the [[Irish Sea]] to the east. The southern part of the county is dominated by the [[Dublin Mountains]], which rise to around {{convert|2500|ft|m|order=flip}} and contain numerous valleys, reservoirs and forests. The county's east coast is punctuated by several bays and inlets, including [[Rogerstown Estuary]], [[Donabate#Broadmeadow Estuary|Broadmeadow Estuary]], [[Baldoyle Bay]] and most prominently, [[Dublin Bay]]. The northern section of the county, today known as [[Fingal]], varies enormously in character, from densely populated suburban towns of the city's [[commuter belt]] to flat, fertile plains, which are some of the country's largest horticultural and agricultural hubs.

Dublin is the oldest county in Ireland, and was the first part of the island to be [[shire]]d following the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasion]] in the late 1100s. While it is no longer a local government area, Dublin retains a strong identity, and continues to be referred to as both a region and county interchangeably, including at government body level.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/surveillance/covid-1914-dayepidemiologyreports/|title=DCOVID-19 14-day epidemiology reports- June 2021|work=HSE|access-date=26 June 2021|archive-date=30 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630150236/https://www.hpsc.ie/a-z/respiratory/coronavirus/novelcoronavirus/surveillance/covid-1914-dayepidemiologyreports/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dublinchamber.ie/media/news/february-2018/dublin-ranks-2nd-lowest-for-government-capital-spe|title=Dublin Ranks 2nd Lowest for Government Capital Spending|work=Dublin Chamber of Commerce|access-date=26 June 2021|archive-date=26 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210626131811/https://www.dublinchamber.ie/media/news/february-2018/dublin-ranks-2nd-lowest-for-government-capital-spe|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Etymology==
[[File:Vikings 841 at Dublin.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|Viking fleet [[Early Scandinavian Dublin|landing at Dublin]], 841]]
{{See also|Etymological list of counties of Ireland}}
County Dublin is named after the city of Dublin, which is an [[anglicisation]] of its [[Old Norse]] name {{lang|non|Dyflin}}. The city was founded in the 9th century AD by [[Viking]] settlers who established the [[Kingdom of Dublin]]. The Viking settlement was preceded by a Christian ecclesiastical site known as {{lang|sga|Duiblinn}}, from which {{lang|non|italic=unset|Dyflin}} took its name. {{lang|sga|italic=unset|Duiblinn}} derives from the early [[Classical Gaelic|Classical Irish]] {{lang|ghc|Dubhlind}}&nbsp;/ {{lang|ghc|Duibhlind}} – from {{lang|ghc|dubh}} ({{IPA-all|d̪uβ}}, {{IPA-all|d̪uw}}, {{IPA-all|d̪uː}}) meaning 'black, dark', and {{lang|ghc|lind}} ({{IPA-all|lʲiɲ(d̪ʲ)}}) 'pool', referring to a dark tidal pool. This tidal pool was located where the [[River Poddle]] entered the [[River Liffey|Liffey]], to the rear of [[Dublin Castle]].

The [[hinterland]] of Dublin in the Norse period was named {{Langx|non|Dyflinnar skíði|lit=Dublinshire}}.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Church |first=Peter J. |date=2021 |title=Why Are There Very Few Scandinavian Place-names in Ireland? |url=https://www.ssns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/02_Church_2021_Vol_52_pp_22_37.pdf |journal=[[Scottish Society for Northern Studies|Northern Studies]] |volume=52 |pages=22–37}}</ref>{{Rp|page=24}}

In addition to {{lang|non|italic=unset|Dyflin}}, a Gaelic settlement known as {{lang|ga|italic=unset|Áth Cliath}} ('ford of hurdles')<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Palgrave Handbook of Literature and the City|last=Tambling|first=Jeremy|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2017|isbn=978-1137549105|page=98}}</ref> was located further up the Liffey, near present-day [[Father Mathew Bridge]]. {{lang|ga|Baile Átha Cliath}} means 'town of the hurdled ford', with {{lang|ga|Áth Cliath}} referring to a [[Ford (crossing)|fording point]] along the river. As with {{lang|non|italic=unset|Duiblinn}}, an early Christian monastery was also located at {{lang|sga|italic=unset|Áth Cliath}}, on the site that is currently occupied by the [[Whitefriar Street Carmelite Church]].

Dublin was the first county in Ireland to be shired after the [[Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman Conquest]] in the late 12th century. The Normans captured the Kingdom of Dublin from its [[Norse-Gael]] rulers and the name was used as the basis for the county's official [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] (and later [[English language|English]]) name. However, in Modern Irish the region was named after the [[Gaels|Gaelic]] settlement of {{lang|ga|italic=unset|Baile Átha Cliath}} or simply {{lang|ga|italic=unset|Áth Cliath}}. As a result, Dublin is one of four counties in Ireland with a different name origin for both Irish and English – the others being [[County Wexford|Wexford]], [[County Waterford|Waterford]], and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]], whose English names are also derived from Old Norse.

==History==
{{Main|History of Dublin}}
[[File:Tibradden Chambered Cairn.jpg|thumb|left|Prehistoric [[passage tomb]] at Tibradden]]
The earliest recorded inhabitants of present-day Dublin settled along the mouth of the [[River Liffey]]. The remains of five wooden fish traps were discovered near [[Spencer Dock]] in 2007. These traps were designed to catch incoming fish at high tide and could be retrieved at low tide. Thin-bladed stone axes were used to craft the traps and [[radiocarbon dating]] places them in the Late [[Mesolithic]] period ({{circa|6,100}}–5,700 BCE).<ref>{{cite web | title = Dublin, The Prehistoric City | date = 17 May 2011 | publisher = Irish archaeology | url = http://irisharchaeology.ie/2011/05/dublin-the-prehistoric-city/ | access-date = 3 August 2021 | archive-date = 3 August 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210803194412/http://irisharchaeology.ie/2011/05/dublin-the-prehistoric-city/ | url-status = live }}</ref>

The [[Vikings]] invaded the region in the mid-9th century AD and founded what would become the city of Dublin. Over time they mixed with the natives of the area, becoming [[Norse–Gaels]]. The Vikings raided across Ireland, Britain, France and Spain during this period and under their rule Dublin developed into the largest slave market in [[Western Europe]].<ref name="ReferenceA">''The Historical encyclopedia of world slavery'', Volume 1; Volume 7 By Junius P. Rodriguez ABC-CLIO, 1997</ref> While the Vikings were formidable at sea, the superiority of Irish land forces soon became apparent, and the kingdom's Norse rulers were first exiled from the region as early as 902. Dublin was captured by the [[High King of Ireland]], [[Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill|Máel Sechnaill II]], in 980, who freed the kingdom's Gaelic slaves.<ref>Downham, ''Viking Kings'', pp. 51–52 & 190; Hudson, "Óláf Sihtricson"; Hudson, "Máel Sechnaill"; Hudson, ''Viking Pirates'', page numbers needed.</ref> Dublin was again defeated by Máel Sechnaill in 988 and forced to accept [[Brehon law]] and pay taxes to the High King.<ref>{{cite web | title = On this day – 988 | work = History of Ireland | date = 10 July 2017 | publisher = Stair na hEireann | url = https://stairnaheireann.net/2017/07/10/otd-in-988-the-norse-king-gluniairn-recognises-mael-sechnaill-mac-domnaill-high-king-of-ireland-and-agrees-to-pay-taxes-and-accept-brehon-law-the-event-is-considered-to-be-the-founding-o/ | access-date = 3 August 2021 | archive-date = 3 August 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210803194411/https://stairnaheireann.net/2017/07/10/otd-in-988-the-norse-king-gluniairn-recognises-mael-sechnaill-mac-domnaill-high-king-of-ireland-and-agrees-to-pay-taxes-and-accept-brehon-law-the-event-is-considered-to-be-the-founding-o/ | url-status = live }}</ref> Successive defeats at the hands of [[Brian Boru]] in 999 and, most famously, at the [[Battle of Clontarf]] in 1014, relegated Dublin to the status of lesser kingdom.
[[File:Viking Ireland.png|thumb|left|Norse-Gael [[Kingdom of Dublin]] in the 10th Century]]
In 1170, the ousted [[King of Leinster]], [[Diarmait Mac Murchada]], and his Norman allies agreed to capture Dublin at a war council in [[Waterford]]. They evaded the intercepting army of High King [[Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair]] by marching through the [[Wicklow Mountains]], arriving outside the walls of Dublin in late September.<ref>Martin (2008), p.76</ref> The King of Dublin, [[Ascall mac Ragnaill]], met with Mac Murchada for negotiations; however, while talks were ongoing, the Normans, led by [[Miles de Cogan|de Cogan]] and [[Raymond FitzGerald|FitzGerald]], stormed Dublin and overwhelmed its defenders, forcing mac Ragnaill to flee to the [[Northern Isles]].<ref>[[#D5|Downham (2013)]] p. 157 n. 1.</ref>  Separate attempts to retake Dublin were launched by both Ua Conchobair and mac Ragnaill in 1171, both of which were unsuccessful.

The authority over Ireland established by the Anglo-Norman [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]] was gradually lost during the [[Gaelic Resurgence|Gaelic resurgence]] from the 13th century onwards. English power diminished so significantly that by the early 16th century English laws and customs were restricted to a small area around Dublin known as "[[The Pale]]". The [[Thomas FitzGerald, 10th Earl of Kildare|Earl of Kildare's]] failed rebellion in 1535 reignited [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] interest in Ireland, and [[Henry VIII]] proclaimed the [[Kingdom of Ireland]] in 1542, with Dublin as its capital. Over the next 60 years the [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]] spread to every corner of the island, which was fully subdued by [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|1603]].

Despite harsh [[Penal Laws against Irish Catholics|penal laws]] and unfavourable trade restrictions imposed upon Ireland, Dublin flourished in the 18th century. The [[Georgian Dublin|Georgian buildings]] which still define much of Dublin's architectural landscape to this day were mostly built over a 50-year period spanning from about 1750 to 1800. Bodies such as the [[Wide Streets Commission]] completely reshaped the city, demolishing most of medieval Dublin in the process.<ref name="spaceandtime">{{Cite book|title=Dublin Through Space & Time|editor1-first=Joseph|editor1-last=Brady|editor2-first=Anngret|editor2-last=Simms|first=Edel|last=Sheridan|chapter=Designing the Capital City|isbn=978-1-85182-641-4|publisher=Four Courts Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/dublinthroughspa0000unse/page/112 112]|year=2001|url=https://archive.org/details/dublinthroughspa0000unse/page/112}}</ref> During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], the penal laws were gradually repealed and members of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] began to regard themselves as citizens of a distinct Irish nation.<ref name=77and78IrishImperialNetworks>Crosbie, Barry ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=DpvRF0W5KIMC&dq=1770s+of+Henry+Grattan%27s+Patriot+Party.&pg=PA78 Irish Imperial Networks Migration, Social Communication and Exchange in Nineteenth-Century India] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210803194410/https://books.google.com/books?id=DpvRF0W5KIMC&pg=PA78&lpg=PA78&dq=1770s+of+Henry+Grattan's+Patriot+Party.&source=bl&ots=US5gZDZjdQ&sig=BljPPtWhdJfPkUOkLsJRPU_N7dU&hl=en&sa=X&ei=miZgVJvHPM-tyATTjYCYCQ&ved=0CEcQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q=1770s%20of%20Henry%20Grattan's%20Patriot%20Party.&f=false |date=3 August 2021 }}.''

After decades of political unrest, Ireland appeared to be on the brink of civil war as a result of the [[Home Rule Crisis]]. Despite being the centre of [[Unionism in Ireland|Irish unionism]] outside of [[Ulster]], Dublin was overwhelmingly in favour of Home Rule. Unionist parties had performed poorly in the county since the 1870s, leading contemporary historian [[W. E. H. Lecky]] to conclude that "Ulster unionism is the only form of Irish unionism that is likely to count as a serious political force".<ref>{{cite journal | title = The Failure of Unionism in Dublin, 1900 | journal = Irish Historical Studies | publisher = Cambridge University Press | jstor = 30008694 | url = https://www.jstor.org/stable/30008694 | access-date = 3 August 2021 | last1 = Jackson | first1 = Alvin | year = 1989 | volume = 26 | issue = 104 | pages = 377–395 | doi = 10.1017/S0021121400010129 | s2cid = 153472872 | archive-date = 3 August 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210803153556/https://www.jstor.org/stable/30008694 | url-status = live | url-access = subscription }}</ref> Unlike their counterparts in the north, "southern unionists" were a clear minority in the rest of Ireland, and as such were much more willing to co-operate with the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]] (IPP) to avoid [[Partition of Ireland|partition]].

The question of Home Rule was put on hold due to the outbreak of the [[First World War]] but was never to be revisited as a series of missteps by the British government, such as executing the leaders of the [[1916 Easter Rising]] and the [[Conscription Crisis of 1918]], fuelled the [[Irish revolutionary period]]. The IPP were nearly wiped out by [[Sinn Féin]] in the [[1918 Irish general election|1918 general election]] and, following a brief [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]], 26 of Ireland's 32 counties seceded from the United Kingdom in December 1922, with Dublin becoming the capital of the [[Irish Free State]], and later the Republic of Ireland.<ref name=ark>{{cite web|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/h1918.htm |title=The Irish Election of 1918 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824020254/http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/h1918.htm |archive-date=24 August 2006 |website=[[Northern Ireland Social and Political Archive|ARK]] |access-date=30 December 2013}}</ref>

From the 1960s onwards, Dublin city greatly expanded due to urban renewal works and the construction of large suburbs such as [[Tallaght]], [[Coolock]] and [[Ballymun]], which resettled both the rural and urban poor of County Dublin in newer state-built accommodation.<ref>{{cite web | title = An Irishman's Diary on Tallaght's journey from village to city | work = Hugh Oram | publisher = [[The Irish Times]] | url = https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irishman-s-diary-on-tallaght-s-journey-from-village-to-city-1.2309189 | access-date = 3 August 2021 | archive-date = 27 December 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151227033631/http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irishman-s-diary-on-tallaght-s-journey-from-village-to-city-1.2309189 | url-status = live }}</ref> Dublin was the driving force behind Ireland's [[Celtic Tiger]] period, an era of rapid economic growth that started in the early 1990s.

Dublin is the [[List of Irish counties by area|third smallest]] of Ireland's 32 counties by area, and the largest in terms of population. It is the third-smallest of Leinster's 12 counties in size and the largest by population. Dublin shares a border with three counties – [[County Meath|Meath]] to the north and west, [[County Kildare|Kildare]] to the west and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]] to the south. To the east, Dublin has an [[List of Irish counties by coastline|Irish Sea coastline]] which stretches for {{convert|155|km|mi}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fingal.ie/council/service/coastal-walks-0|title=Coastal Walks|work=Fingal County Council|access-date=8 November 2020|archive-date=5 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201105022604/https://www.fingal.ie/council/service/coastal-walks-0|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://dlrcoco.citizenspace.com/masterplanning/sandycove-and-bullock-harbour-masterplan-consultat/supporting_documents/Bullock%20and%20Sandycove%20Harbours%20Draft%20Masterplan%202019.pdf|title=Bullock and Sandycove Harbours Draft Masterplan|work=DLRCoCo|access-date=8 November 2020|archive-date=11 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111120337/https://dlrcoco.citizenspace.com/masterplanning/sandycove-and-bullock-harbour-masterplan-consultat/supporting_documents/Bullock%20and%20Sandycove%20Harbours%20Draft%20Masterplan%202019.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dublin is a topographically varied region. The city centre is generally very low-lying, and many areas of coastal Dublin are at or near sea-level. In the south of the county, the topography rises steeply from sea-level at the coast to over {{convert|500|m|ft}} in just a few kilometres. This natural barrier has resulted in densely populated coastal settlements in [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]] and westward urban sprawl in [[South Dublin]]. In contrast, [[Fingal]] is generally rural in nature and much less densely populated than the rest of the county. Consequently, Fingal is significantly larger than the other three local authorities and covers about 49.5% of County Dublin's land area. Fingal is also perhaps the flattest region in Ireland, with the low-lying [[Naul Hills]] rising to a maximum height of just {{convert|176|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fingalcoco.ie/minutes/meeting_doc.aspx?id=20716|title=Fingal County Council, 2002|access-date=27 November 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722161412/http://www.fingalcoco.ie/minutes/meeting_doc.aspx?id=20716|archive-date=22 July 2011}}</ref>

Dublin is bounded to the south by the [[Wicklow Mountains]]. Where the mountains extend into County Dublin, they are known locally as the Dublin Mountains (''Sléibhte Bhaile Átha Cliath''). [[Kippure]], on the Dublin–Wicklow border, is the county's highest mountain, at {{convert|757|m|ft}} above sea level. Crossed by the [[Dublin Mountains Way]], they are a popular amenity area, with [[Two Rock]], [[Three Rock]], [[Tibradden]], [[Ticknock]], [[Montpelier Hill]], and [[Glenasmole]] being among the most heavily foot-falled hiking destinations in Ireland. Forest cover extends to over {{convert|6,000|ha|acre}} within the county, nearly all of which is located in the Dublin Mountains. With just 6.5% of Dublin under forest, it is the 6th least forested county in Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/forestry/forestservicegeneralinformation/MainFindings301018.pdf|title=National Forestry Inventory, Third Cycle 2017|work=DAFM|access-date=8 November 2020|archive-date=27 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127111823/https://www.agriculture.gov.ie/media/migration/forestry/forestservicegeneralinformation/MainFindings301018.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Much of the county is drained by its three major rivers – the [[River Liffey]], the [[River Tolka]] in north Dublin, and the [[River Dodder]] in south Dublin. The Liffey, at {{convert|132|km|mi}} in length, is the 8th longest river in Ireland, and rises near [[Tonduff]] in County Wicklow, reaching the Irish Sea at the [[Dublin Docklands]]. The Liffey cuts through the centre of Dublin city, and the resultant [[Northside, Dublin|Northside]]–[[Southside, Dublin|Southside]] divide is an often used social, economic and linguistic distinction. Notable inlets include the central [[Dublin Bay]], [[Rogerstown Estuary]], the estuary of the Broadmeadow and Killiney Bay, under [[Killiney Hill]]. Headlands include [[Howth Head]], [[Drumanagh]] and the Portraine Shore.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://gsi.geodata.gov.ie/downloads/Geoheritage/Reports/DF001_Portraine_Shore.pdf|title=Portraine Shore – Fingal County Geological Site Report|work=Fingal County Council|access-date=30 November 2023}}</ref> In terms of [[biodiversity]], these estuarine and coastal regions are home to a wealth ecologically important areas. County Dublin contains 11 [[European Union|EU]]-designated [[Special Area of Conservation|Special Areas of Conservation]] (SACs) and 11 [[Special Protection Area]]s (SPAs).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npws.ie/protected-sites|title=Protected Sites in Ireland|work=NPWS|access-date=8 November 2020|archive-date=8 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201108042254/https://www.npws.ie/protected-sites|url-status=live}}</ref>

The bedrock geology of Dublin consists primarily of [[Lower Carboniferous]] limestone, which underlies about two thirds of the entire county, stretching from Skerries to [[Booterstown]]. During the Lower Carboniferous (ca. 340 Mya), the area was part of a warm tropical sea inhabited by an abundance of [[corals]], [[crinoids]] and [[brachiopods]]. The oldest rocks in Dublin are the [[Cambrian]] shales located on Howth Head, which were laid down ca. 500 Mya. Disruption following the closure of the [[Iapetus Ocean]] approximately 400 [[Geologic time scale|Mya]] resulted in the formation of [[granite]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gsi.ie/documents/Geoschol_Dublin_Geology.pdf|title=Geology of County Dublin|work=geoschol|access-date=8 November 2020|archive-date=15 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171115060015/https://www.gsi.ie/documents/Geoschol_Dublin_Geology.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> This is now exposed at the surface from the Dublin Mountains to the coastal areas of Dún Laoghaire. 19th-century [[Lead]] extraction and smelting at the [[Ballycorus Leadmines]] caused widespread [[lead poisoning]], and the area was once nicknamed "Death Valley".<ref>Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council, p. 10.</ref>

Dublin is in a maritime [[temperate]] [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] region according to [[Köppen climate classification]]. Its climate is characterised by cool winters, mild humid summers, and a lack of temperature extremes. [[Met Éireann]] have a number of weather stations in the county, with its two primary stations at [[Dublin Airport]] and [[Casement Aerodrome]].

Annual temperatures typically fall within a narrow range. In [[Merrion Square]], the coldest month is February, with an average minimum temperature of {{convert|4.1|C|F|abbr=on}}, and the warmest month is July, with an average maximum temperature of {{convert|20.1|C|F|abbr=on}}. Due to the [[urban heat island]] effect, Dublin city has the warmest summertime nights in Ireland. The average minimum temperature at Merrion Square in July is {{convert|13.5|C|F|abbr=on}}, similar to [[London]] and [[Berlin]], and the lowest July temperature ever recorded at the station was {{convert|7.8|C|F|abbr=on}} on 3 July 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data|title=Historical Data: DUBLIN (MERRION SQUARE) – Station No. 3923|publisher=Met Éireann|access-date=9 June 2022|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624195529/https://www.met.ie/climate/available-data/historical-data|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/mapserver/climatology.php#bottom|title=Climatological Information for Merrion Square, Ireland|publisher=European Climate Assessment & Dataset|access-date=8 November 2020|archive-date=30 August 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120830134927/http://eca.knmi.nl/utils/mapserver/climatology.php#bottom|url-status=live}}</ref> At Dublin Airport, the driest month is February with {{convert|48.8|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall, and the wettest month is November, with {{convert|79.0|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain on average.

As the prevailing wind direction in Ireland is from the south and west, the Wicklow Mountains create a [[rain shadow]] over much of the county. Dublin's sheltered location makes it the driest place in Ireland, receiving only about half the rainfall of the west coast. [[Ringsend]] in the south of Dublin city records the lowest rainfall in the country, with an average annual precipitation of {{convert|683|mm|0|abbr=on}}. The wettest area of the county is the [[Glenasmole|Glenasmole Valley]], which receives {{convert|1,159|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rainfall per year. As a temperate coastal county, snow is relatively uncommon in lowland areas; however, Dublin is particularly vulnerable to heavy snowfall on rare occasions where cold, dry easterly winds dominate during the winter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.met.ie/climate/temperature.asp |title=Temperature – Climate |publisher=Met Éireann – The Irish Meteorological Service Online |date=2 January 1979 |access-date=20 August 2010 |archive-date=7 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107003129/https://www.met.ie/climate/temperature.asp%20 |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the late summer and early autumn, Dublin can experience Atlantic storms, which bring strong winds and torrential rain to Ireland. Dublin was the county worst-affected by [[Hurricane Charley (1986)|Hurricane Charley]] in 1986. It caused severe flooding, especially along the River Dodder, and is reputed to be the worst flood event in Dublin's history. Rainfall records were shattered across the county. Kippure recorded {{convert|280|mm|0|abbr=on}} of rain over a 24-hour period, the greatest daily rainfall total ever recorded in Ireland. The government allocated [[Irish pound|IR£]]6,449,000 (equivalent to US$20.5 million in 2020) to repair the damage wrought by Charley.<ref>{{cite web|date=8 March 1990 |title=Storm and Flood Damage: Motion – Seanad Éireann |publisher=Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas |access-date=26 October 2008 |url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0124/S.0124.199003080005.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607120811/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/S/0124/S.0124.199003080005.html |archive-date=7 June 2011 }}</ref> The two reservoirs at Bohernabreena in the Dublin Mountains were upgraded in 2006 after a study into the impact of Hurricane Charley concluded that a slightly larger storm would have caused the reservoir dams to burst, which would have resulted in catastrophic damage and significant loss of life.

===Offshore Islands===
In contrast with the [[Wild Atlantic Way|Atlantic Coast]], the east coast of Ireland has relatively few islands. County Dublin has one of the highest concentrations of islands on the Irish east coast. Colt Island, St. Patrick's Island, Shenick Island and numerous smaller [[islets]] are clustered off the coast of Skerries, and are collectively known as the "Skerries Islands Natural Heritage Area". Further out lies [[Rockabill]], which is Dublin's most isolated island, at about {{convert|6|km|mi}} offshore. [[Lambay Island]], at {{convert|250|ha|acre}}, is the largest island off Ireland's east coast and the easternmost point of County Dublin. Lambay supports one of the largest seabird colonies in Ireland and, curiously, also supports a population of non-native [[Red-necked wallaby|Red-necked wallabies]].<ref name="Alt_126m_MV">{{cite web |title=East coast – Knockbane (Hill), Lambay Island |url=https://mountainviews.ie/summit/1370/ |website=MountainViews.ie |access-date=3 June 2020 |quote=Height: 126m OS 1:50k Mapsheet: 43 Grid Reference: O31600 51000 |archive-date=3 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200603091908/https://mountainviews.ie/summit/1370/ |url-status=live }}</ref>  To the south of Lambay lies a smaller island known as [[Ireland's Eye]] – the result of a mistranslation of the island's Irish name by invading [[Vikings]].

[[Bull Island]] is a man-made island lying roughly parallel to the shoreline which began to form following the construction of the [[Bull Wall]] in 1825. The island is still growing and is currently {{convert|5|km|mi}} long and {{convert|0.8|km|mi}} wide. In 1981, North Bull Island (''Oileán an Tairbh Thuaidh'') was designated as a [[UNESCO]] biosphere.<ref>{{Cite web|title=North Bull Island|website=[[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] Sites Information Service|url=https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/406|access-date=25 April 2018|archive-date=24 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180524082454/https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/406|url-status=live}}</ref>

For statistical purposes at European level, the county as a whole forms the Dublin Region – a [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS III]] entity – which is in turn part of the [[Eastern and Midland Region]], a NUTS II entity. Each of the local authorities have representatives on the Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly.

====Baronies====
{{See also|List of baronies of Ireland}}
There are ten historic [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] in the county.<ref>[https://www.logainm.ie/en/s?txt=in:100002&cat=BAR Placenames Database of Ireland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210121202131/https://www.logainm.ie/en/s?txt=in:100002&cat=BAR |date=21 January 2021 }} – Baronies.</ref> While baronies continue to be officially defined units, they ceased to have any administrative function following the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898|Local Government Act 1898]], and any changes to county boundaries after the mid-19th century are not reflected in their extent. The last boundary change of a barony in Dublin was in 1842, when the barony of Balrothery was divided into Balrothery East and Balrothery West. The largest recorded barony in Dublin in 1872 was Uppercross, at {{convert|39,032|acre|km2}}, and the smallest barony was Dublin, at {{convert|1,693|acre|km2}}.

{{Main article|List of townlands of County Dublin}}
Townlands are the smallest officially defined geographical divisions in Ireland. There are 1,090 townlands in Dublin, of which 88 are historic town boundaries. These town boundaries are registered as their own townlands and are much larger than rural townlands. The smallest rural townlands in Dublin are just 1 acre in size, most of which are offshore islands (''Clare Rock Island, Lamb Island, Maiden Rock, Muglins, Thulla Island''). The largest rural townland in Dublin is 2,797 acres (''Caastlekelly''). The average size of a townland in the county (excluding towns) is 205 acres.

The city of [[Dublin]] had been administered separately since the 13th century. Under the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]], the two areas were defined as the administrative county of Dublin and the county borough of Dublin, with the latter in the city area.

In 1985, County Dublin was divided into three electoral counties: Dublin–Belgard to the southwest (South Dublin from 1991), Dublin–Fingal to the north (Fingal from 1991), and Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown to the southeast.<ref>{{cite ISB|year=1985|num=7|section=12|stitle=Establishment of Dublin Electoral Counties|title=Local Government (Reorganisation) Act 1985|date=3 April 1985|access-date=9 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605130709/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1985/en/act/pub/0007/sec0012.html |archive-date=5 June 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite ISB|type=si|year=1985|num=133|title=Dublin Electoral Counties Order 1985|date=10 May 1985|access-date=13 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101111023846/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1985/en/si/0133.html |archive-date=11 November 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite ISB|year=1991|num=11|section=26|stitle=Amendment of Local Government (Reorganisation) Act 1985|title=Local Government Act 1991 |date=18 May 1991|access-date=9 December 2021}}</ref>

On 1 January 1994, under the [[Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993]], the County Dublin ceased to exist as a local government area, and was succeeded by the counties of [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]], [[Fingal]] and [[South Dublin]], each coterminous (with minor boundary adjustments) with the area of the corresponding electoral county.<ref>{{cite ISB|year=1993|num=31|title=[[Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993]]|section=9}}</ref><ref>{{cite ISB|year=1993|num=31|section=2|title=[[Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605192657/http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0031/print.html |archive-date=5 June 2011|quote='the county', in relation to any time before the establishment day, means the administrative county of Dublin.}}</ref> In discussing the legislation, [[Avril Doyle]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]] said, "The Bill before us today effectively abolishes County Dublin, and as one born and bred in these parts of Ireland I find it rather strange that we in this House are abolishing County Dublin.

For a period in 2020 during the [[COVID-19 pandemic in the Republic of Ireland|COVID-19 pandemic]], to reduce person-to-person contact, government regulations restricted activity to "within the county in which the relevant residence is situated". Within the regulations, the local government areas of "Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Fingal, South Dublin and Dublin City" were deemed to be a single county (as were the city and the county of Cork, and the city and the county of Galway).<ref>{{cite ISB|title=Health Act 1947 (Section 31A – Temporary Restrictions) (Covid-19) (No. 2) Regulations 2020|year=2020|type=si|num=206|date=8 June 2020|access-date=10 January 2022}}</ref>

The latest [[Ordnance Survey Ireland]] "Discovery Series" (Third Edition 2005) 1:50,000 map of the Dublin Region, Sheet 50, shows the boundaries of the city and three surrounding counties of the region. Extremities of the Dublin Region, in the north and south of the region, appear in other sheets of the series, 43 and 56 respectively.

There are four [[Local government|local authorities]] whose remit collectively encompasses the geographic area of the county and city of Dublin. These are [[Dublin City Council]], [[South Dublin County Council]], [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council]] and [[Fingal County Council]].

Until 1 January 1994, the administrative county of Dublin was administered by [[Dublin County Council]]. From that date, its functions were succeeded by Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council and South Dublin County Council, each with its [[county town|county seat]], respectively administering the new counties established on that date.<ref>{{cite ISB|year=1993|num=31|title=[[Local Government (Dublin) Act 1993]]|section=11|stitle=Establishment of councils of administrative counties|quote=(1) On the establishment day a council shall stand established in each of the administrative counties established by section 9 and each such council shall consist of a cathaoirleach and councillors|date=21 December 1993|access-date=8 January 2022 }}</ref>

The city was previously designated a county borough and administered by [[Dublin Corporation]]. Under the [[Local Government Act 2001]], the country was divided into local government areas of cities and counties, with the county borough of Dublin being designated a city for all purposes, now administered by [[Dublin City Council]]. Each [[Local government in the Republic of Ireland|local authority]] is responsible for certain local [[Public services|services]] such as sanitation, planning and development, libraries, the collection of motor taxation, local roads and [[social housing]].

Dublin, comprising the four local government areas in the county, is a strategic planning area within the [[Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly]] (EMRA).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Regional Assemblies and the Eastern and Midland Region |url=https://emra.ie/regional-spatial-and-economic-strategies-2/ |website=Eastern and Midland Regional Assembly |access-date=22 January 2022 |archive-date=24 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220124113758/https://emra.ie/regional-spatial-and-economic-strategies-2/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite ISB|year=2014|type=si|num=573|title=Local Government Act 1991 (Regional Assemblies) (Establishment) Order 2014|date=16 December 2014|access-date=18 March 2022}}</ref> It is a [[Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics|NUTS]] Level III [[NUTS statistical regions of Ireland|region of Ireland]].

[[File:County Dublin Population Density Map.png|thumb|left|Population density map of County Dublin]]
As of the [[2022 census of Ireland|2022 census]], the population of Dublin was 1,458,154, an 8.4% increase since the [[2016 census of Ireland|2016 Census]]. The county's population first surpassed 1&nbsp;million in 1981, and is projected to reach 1.8&nbsp;million by 2036.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dublinchamber.ie/About-Us/Economic-Profile-of-Dublin|title=Economic Profile of Dublin – Demographics|work=Dublin Chamber of Commerce|access-date=27 July 2023|archive-date=|archive-url=}}</ref>

Dublin is Ireland's [[List of Irish counties by population|most populous county]], a position it has held since the 1926 Census, when it overtook [[County Antrim]]. As of 2022, County Dublin has over twice the population of County Antrim and two and a half times the population of [[County Cork]]. Approximately 21% of Ireland's population lives within County Dublin (28% if only the [[Republic of Ireland]] is counted). Additionally, Dublin has more people than the combined populations of Ireland's 16 smallest counties.

With an area of just {{convert|922|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, Dublin is by far the most densely populated county in Ireland. The population density of the county is 1,582 people per square kilometre – over 7 times higher than Ireland's second most densely populated county, [[County Down]] in Northern Ireland.

During the [[Celtic Tiger]] period, a large number of Dublin natives (Dubliners) moved to the rapidly expanding commuter towns in the adjoining counties. As of 2022, approximately 27.2% (345,446) of Dubliners were living outside of County Dublin. People born within Dublin account for 28% of the population of [[County Meath|Meath]], 32% of [[County Kildare|Kildare]], and 37% of [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]]. There are 922,744 Dublin natives living within the county, accounting for 63.3% of the population. People born in other Irish counties living within Dublin account for roughly 11% of the population.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=https://data.cso.ie/|title=Census 2022 Profile 1 – Population Distribution and Movement F1034 – Population Usually Resident and Present in the State|work=CSO|access-date=27 July 2023}}</ref>

Between 2016 and 2022, international migration produced a net increase of 88,300 people. Dublin has the highest proportion of international residents of any county in Ireland, with around 25% of the county's population being born outside of the [[Republic of Ireland]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cso.ie|title=Census 2022 Profile 1 – Population Distribution and Movement F1052 – Birthplace of Population Usually Resident and Present in the State|work=CSO|access-date=27 July 2023}}</ref>

As of the 2022 census, 5.6 percent of the county's population was reported as younger than 5 years old, 25.7 percent were between 5 and 25, 55.3 percent were between 25 and 65, and 13.4 percent of the population was older than 65. Of this latter group, 48,865 people (3.4 percent) were over the age of 80, more than doubling since 2016. Across all age groups, there were slightly more females (51.06 percent) than males (48.94 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.cso.ie/table/F1020|title=F1020 – Population|work=CSO|access-date=30 November 2023}}</ref>

In 2021, there were 16,596 births within the county, and the average age of a first time mother was 31.9.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://statbank.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=VSA16&PLanguage=0|title=Births by County, Year and Statistic|work=CSO|access-date=3 November 2020|archive-date=14 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191114182001/https://statbank.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=VSA16&PLanguage=0|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Migration===
[[File:Polish shop dublin.jpg|thumb|A Polish shop in Dublin]]
Over a quarter (25.2 percent) of County Dublin's population was born outside of the Republic of Ireland. In 2022, Dublin City had the highest percentage of non-nationals in the county (27.3 percent), and South Dublin had the lowest (20.9 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.cso.ie/table/F10521|title=F1052 – Birthplace of Population Usually Resident and Present in the State|work=CSO|access-date=30 November 2023}}</ref> Historically, the immigrant population of Dublin was mainly from the [[United Kingdom]] and other [[European Union]] member states. However, results from the 2022 census revealed that immigrants from non-EU/UK countries were the largest source of foreign-born residents for the first time, accounting for 12.9 percent of the county's population. Those from other [[European Union]] member states accounted for 8.3 percent of Dublin's population, and those from the [[United Kingdom]] a further 4.1 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.cso.ie/table/SAP2022T2T1CTY|title=Usually Resident Population by Birthplace or Citizenship|work=CSO|access-date=30 November 2023}}</ref>

Prior to the 2000s, the UK was consistently the largest single source of non-nationals living in Dublin. After declining in the previous two census periods, the number of UK-born residents living in Dublin increased by 5.8 percent between 2016 and 2022. There was a large difference between the number of people living in Dublin who were born in the UK (58,586) and those who held sole-UK citizenship in the 2022 census (22,936). This discrepancy can arise for a variety of factors, such as people born in Northern Ireland claiming [[Irish nationality law|Irish citizenship]] rather than UK citizenship, Irish people born in the UK who now live in Dublin, British people who have become [[Naturalization|natural]] citizens, and foreign residents of Dublin who were born in the UK but are not UK citizens. Depending on an individual's responses in the census, all of these examples could result in the country of birth being registered by the CSO as the United Kingdom, but nationality being registered as Irish or a third country.

Following its [[2004 enlargement of the European Union|accession to the EU]], the Polish quickly became the fastest growing immigrant community in Dublin. Just 188 Poles applied for Irish work permits in 1999. By 2006 this number had grown to 93,787.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.tcd.ie/sociology/assets/pdf/Polonia%20in%20Dublin%20Report%20I%5B1%5D.pdf|title=Polonia in Dublin|work=Trinity College Dublin|access-date=3 November 2020|archive-date=8 November 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191108114555/https://www.tcd.ie/sociology/assets/pdf/Polonia%20in%20Dublin%20Report%20I%5B1%5D.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> After the [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|2008 Irish economic downturn]], as many as 3,000 Poles left Ireland each month. Despite this, Poles remain one of Dublin's largest foreign-born groups. In contrast to more recent arrivals, a large percentage of Dublin's Polish citizens (30.9 percent) also hold Irish citizenship.

Outside of Europe, [[Indian people|Indians]] and [[Brazilians]] are the predominant foreign-national groups. As of 2022, Indians were the fastest growing major immigrant group in Dublin, and they are now the county's second largest foreign-born group after the UK. Dublin's Indian community grew by 155.2 percent between 2016 and 2022. There were 29,582 Indian-born residents within Dublin as of 2022, up from 9,884 in the [[2011 census of Ireland|2011 census]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/define.asp?MainTable=E7050&ProductID=DB_E7&PLanguage=0&Tabstrip=&PXSId=0&SessID=7827795&FF=1&tfrequency=1 |title=Population Usually Resident and Present in the State 2011 to 2016 by Sex, Aggregate Town or Rural Area, Birthplace, County of Usual Residence and CensusYear – StatBank – data and statistics |website=CSO |access-date=2 May 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310010253/http://www.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/define.asp?MainTable=E7050&ProductID=DB_E7&PLanguage=0&Tabstrip=&PXSId=0&SessID=7827795&FF=1&tfrequency=1 |archive-date=10 March 2018 }}</ref> The influx of Indians is driven in part by multinational tech companies such as [[Microsoft]], [[Google]] and [[Meta Platforms|Meta]] who have located their European headquarters within the county, in areas such as the [[Silicon Docks]] and [[Sandyford]]. In August 2020, the first dedicated Hindu temple in Ireland was built in [[Walkinstown]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/hindu-temple-dublin-walkinstown-first-opens-5181995-Aug2020/|title=Ireland's first ever Hindu Temple opens today in Dublin|work=journal.ie|date=22 August 2020 |access-date=3 November 2020|archive-date=27 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127150629/https://www.thejournal.ie/hindu-temple-dublin-walkinstown-first-opens-5181995-Aug2020/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The number of Brazilian citizens living in Dublin more than tripled between 2011 and 2022, from 4,641 to 16,441. This increase is mainly a result of Ireland's participation in the Brazilian government's ''[[Ciência sem Fronteiras]]'' programme, which sees thousands of Brazilian students come to study in Ireland each year, many of whom remain in the country afterwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/brazil-ireland-migration-tgip-5556258-Sep2021/|title=Brazilian migration into Ireland: 'There's a mutual compatibility with the Irish'|work=thejournal.ie|date=25 September 2021|access-date=30 November 2023}}</ref>

Although not fully captured during the census period, Dublin also houses a significant number of [[Ukrainian refugee crisis (2022–present)|Ukrainian refugees]] under the [[Temporary Protection Directive]]. As of October 2023, the number of Ukrainians living in emergency accommodation within the county is estimated to be around 14,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.limerickleader.ie/news/national-news/1330675/revealed-number-of-ukrainian-refugees-living-in-ireland-approaches-100-000.html|title=REVEALED: Number of Ukrainian refugees living in Ireland approaches 100,000|work=limerickleader.ie|date=24 October 2023|access-date=30 November 2023}}</ref>

===Ethnicity===

According to the Central Statistics Office, in 2022 the population of County Dublin self-identified as:
* 80.4% White (68.0% White Irish, 12.0% Other White Background, 0.4% Irish Traveller)
* 5.8% [[Asian people|Asian]]
* 3.0% Mixed background
* 2.2% Black
* 8.5% Not Stated

By ethnicity, in 2022 the population was 80.4% white. Those who identified as White Irish constituted 68.0% of the county's population, and [[Irish Traveller]]s accounted for a further 0.4%. Caucasians who did not identify as ethnically Irish accounted for 12.0% of the population.

In terms of total numbers, Dublin has the largest non-white population in Ireland, with an estimated 158,653 residents, accounting for 11.1% of the county's population. Over two-fifths (42.2 percent) of Ireland's black residents live within the county. In terms of percentage of population, Fingal has the highest percentage of both black (3.6 percent) and non-white (12.4 percent) residents of any local authority in Ireland. Conversely, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown in the south of the county has one of Ireland's lowest percentages of black residents, with only 0.77% of the population identifying as black in 2022. Additionally, 43.3% of Ireland's [[Multiracial people|multiracial]] population lives within County Dublin. Those who did not state their ethnicity more than doubled between 2016 and 2022, from 4.1% to 8.5%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.cso.ie/table/SAP2022T2T2CTY |title=SAP2022T2T2CTY – Usually Resident Population by Ethnic or Cultural Background|work=CSO|access-date=25 November 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Interactive Data Visualisations {{!}} CSO Ireland |url=https://visual.cso.ie/?body=entity/ima/cop/2022&boundary=C04160V04929&guid=52be0df1-c0d3-4a30-98c1-df9ada232158&theme=1 |access-date=2024-02-26 |website=visual.cso.ie}}</ref>

The largest [[religious denomination]] by both number of adherents and as a percentage of Dublin's population in 2022 was the Roman Catholic Church, at 57.4 percent. All other Christian denominations including [[Church of Ireland]], [[Eastern Orthodox]], [[Presbyterian]]  and [[Methodist]] accounted for 8.1 percent of Dublin's population. Together, all denominations of Christianity accounted for 65.5 percent of the county's population. According to the 2022 census, Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown is the least religious local authority in Ireland, with 23.9 percent of the population declaring themselves non-religious, followed closely by Dublin city (22.6 percent). In the county as a whole, those unaffiliated with any religion represented 20.1 percent of the population, which is the largest percentage of non-religious people of any county in Ireland. A further 9.1 percent of the population did not state their religion, up from just 4.1 percent in 2016.

Of the non-Christian religions, [[Islam]] is the largest in terms of number of adherents, with Muslims accounting for 2.6% of the population. After Islam, the largest non-Christian religions in 2022 were [[Hinduism]] (1.4 percent) and [[Buddhism]] (0.27 percent). While relatively small in absolute terms, County Dublin contains over half of Ireland's Hindu (58.7 percent) residents, and just under half of its Eastern Orthodox (45.3 percent), Islamic (45.0 percent) and Buddhist (41.7 percent) residents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cpsr/censusofpopulation2022-summaryresults/migrationanddiversity/|title=Census of Population 2022 – Summary Results: Migration and Diversity|work=CSO|date=30 May 2023 |access-date=27 July 2023|archive-date=|archive-url=}}</ref>

Dublin and its hinterland has been a Christian [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Dublin|diocese]] since 1028. For centuries, the [[Primacy of Ireland]] was disputed between Dublin, the social and political capital of Ireland, and [[Armagh]], site of [[Saint Patrick]]'s main church, which was founded in 445 AD. In 1353 the dispute was settled by [[Pope Innocent VI]], who proclaimed that the [[Archbishop of Dublin]] was ''Primate of Ireland'', while the [[Archbishop of Armagh]] was titled ''Primate of All Ireland''. These two distinct titles were replicated in the Church of Ireland following the [[Reformation]]. Historically, County Dublin was the epicentre of [[Protestantism in Ireland]] outside of [[Ulster]]. Records from the [[1891 United Kingdom census|1891 census]] show that the county was 21.4 percent Protestant towards the end of the 19th century. By the 1911 census this had gradually declined to around 20% due to poor economic conditions, as Dublin Protestants moved to industrial [[Belfast]]. Following the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]] (1919–1921), Dublin's Protestant community went into a steady decline, falling to 8.5 percent of the population by 1936.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://statbank.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=EY037&PLanguage=0|title=Population 1891 to 2016 by County, Religion, CensusYear and Statistic|work=CSO|access-date=3 November 2020|archive-date=17 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200717043646/https://statbank.cso.ie/px/pxeirestat/Statire/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?maintable=EY037&PLanguage=0|url-status=live}}</ref>

Between 2016 and 2022, the fastest growing religions in Dublin were Hinduism (148.9 percent), Eastern Orthodox (51.6 percent), and Islam (27.9 percent), while the most rapidly declining religions were [[Evangelicalism]] (−10.4 percent), Catholicism (−8.7 percent), [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (−5.9 percent) and Buddhism (−5.4 percent).

The boundaries of [[Dublin City Council]] form the urban core of the city, often referred to as "Dublin city centre", an area of 117.8 square kilometres. This encompasses the central suburbs of the city, extending as far south as [[Terenure]] and [[Donnybrook, Dublin|Donnybrook]]; as far north as [[Ballymun]] and [[Donaghmede]]; and as far west as [[Ballyfermot]]. As of 2022, there were 592,713 people living within Dublin city centre. However, as the continuous [[built-up area]] extends beyond the city boundaries, the term "Dublin city and suburbs" is commonly employed when referring to the actual extent of Dublin.

====Dublin city and suburbs====
[[File:Dublin City Boundaries 2020.png|thumb|Map of Greater Dublin's defined boundaries]]
Dublin city and suburbs is a CSO-designated urban area which includes the densely populated contiguous built-up area which surrounds Dublin city centre. As of the 2022 census, Dublin city and suburbs encompassed 345&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, expanding in size by 8.7 percent (or 27.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) since the 2016 census. The population of Dublin city and suburbs grew from 1,173,179 in 2016 to 1,263,219 in 2022, an increase of 7.7 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.cso.ie/|title=2022 Census – F1015 – Population|work=CSO|access-date=27 July 2023}}</ref>

Following the 2022 census, Dublin city and suburbs was designated a cross-county settlement for the first time, as the CSO included the Kribensis Manor housing development within the contiguous built-up area of the city. The houses are located in County Meath, along the [[R149 road (Ireland)|R149 road]] between Hilltown and the village of [[Clonee]].

Approximately 87% of County Dublin's population lives within Dublin city and suburbs as of the 2022 census. The remainder of the county covers roughly two thirds of Dublin's land area, but is home to just 196,140 people.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.cso.ie/table/F1013|title=2022 Census Profile 1 – Population Distribution and Movement – F1013 – Population Density and Area Size |work=CSO |access-date=16 July 2024}}</ref>

====Dublin Metropolitan Area====
As the [[city proper]] does not extend beyond [[Dublin Airport]], nearby towns such as Swords, Donabate, Portmarnock and Malahide are not considered part of the city, and are recorded by the CSO as separate settlements. However, under Ireland's National Planning Framework, these towns are considered part of the Dublin Metropolitan Area Strategic Plan (MASP).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sdcc.ie/en/devplan2022/adopted-plan/chapter-2-core-strategy-and-settlement-strategy/chapter-2-core-strategy-and-settlement-strategy.pdf|title=Core Strategy for the Plan|work=South Dublin County Council|access-date=16 July 2024 }}</ref> The MASP also includes towns outside of the county, such as [[Naas]], [[Leixlip]] and [[Maynooth]] in County Kildare, [[Dunboyne]] in County Meath, and [[Bray, County Wicklow|Bray]], [[Kilmacanogue]] and [[Greystones]] in County Wicklow, but does not include Balbriggan, Lusk, Rush or Skerries, which are located in the far north of County Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://emra.ie/dubh/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Greater-Dublin-Area-Regional-Planning-Guidelines-2010-2022-Volume-I.pdf|title=Regional Planning Guidelines For The Greater Dublin Area 2010–2022|work=The Regional Planning Guidelines Office|access-date=3 November 2020|archive-date=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171114070422/http://emra.ie/dubh/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Greater-Dublin-Area-Regional-Planning-Guidelines-2010-2022-Volume-I.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Greater Dublin Area====
The [[Greater Dublin Area]] (GDA) is a commonly used planning jurisdiction which extends to the wider network of commuter towns that are economically connected to Dublin city. The GDA consists of County Dublin and its three neighboring counties, [[County Kildare|Kildare]], [[County Meath|Meath]] and [[County Wicklow|Wicklow]].<ref>{{cite ISB|title=Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008|section=3|stitle=Greater Dublin Area|year=2008|num=15|date=16 July 2008|access-date=14 January 2022}}</ref>

With a population of 2.1 million and an area of 6,986 square kilometres, it contains 40% of the population of the State, and covers 9.9% of its land area.

===Urban Areas===
Under [[Central Statistics Office (Ireland)|CSO]] classification, an "Urban Area" is a town with a population greater than 1,500. Dublin is the most urbanised county in Ireland, with 98% of its residents residing in urban areas as of 2022. Of Dublin's three non-city local authorities, Fingal has the highest proportion of people living in rural areas (7.9%), while Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown has the lowest (1.19%). The western suburbs of Dublin city such as [[Tallaght]] and [[Blanchardstown]] have experienced rapid growth in recent decades, and both areas have a population roughly equivalent to [[Galway city]].

County Dublin has the oldest and most extensive transportation infrastructure in Ireland. The [[Dublin and Kingstown Railway]], opened in December 1834, was Ireland's first railway line. The line, which ran from [[Dublin Pearse railway station|Westland Row]] to [[Dún Laoghaire]], was originally intended to be used for cargo. However, it proved far more popular with passengers and became the world's first commuter railway line.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irishman-s-diary-on-the-dublin-to-kingstown-rail-line-1.2463456|title=An Irishman's Diary on the Dublin to Kingstown rail line|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=30 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630150136/http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/an-irishman-s-diary-on-the-dublin-to-kingstown-rail-line-1.2463456|url-status=live}}</ref> The line has been upgraded multiple times throughout its history and is still in use to this day, making it the oldest commuter railway route in the world.

Public transport in Dublin was managed by the Dublin Transportation Office until 2009, when it was replaced by the [[National Transport Authority (Ireland)|National Transport Authority]] (NTA). The three pillars currently underpinning the public transport network of the [[Greater Dublin Area]] (GDA) are [[Dublin Suburban Rail]], the [[Luas]] and the bus system. There are six [[Commuter (Iarnród Éireann)|commuter]] lines in Dublin, which are managed by [[Iarnród Éireann]]. Five of these lines serve as routes between Dublin and towns across the GDA and beyond. The sixth route, known as [[Dublin Area Rapid Transit]] (DART), is electrified and serves only Dublin and northern Wicklow. The newest addition to Dublin's public transport network is a [[tram]] system called the Luas. The service began with two disconnected lines in 2004,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/archives/2014/0630/627453-luas-is-launched-2004|title=Trams for Dublin 2004|publisher=[[RTÉ Libraries and Archives|RTÉ Archives]]|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=29 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210629192606/https://www.rte.ie/archives/2014/0630/627453-luas-is-launched-2004/|url-status=live}}</ref> with three extensions opened in 2009,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/new-luas-extension-through-docklands-opens-1.786542|title=New Luas extension through Docklands opens|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|first=Tim|last=O'Brien|date=9 December 2009|url-access=subscription|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=18 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218204035/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/new-luas-extension-through-docklands-opens-1.786542|url-status=live}}</ref> 2010<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/luas-opens-to-cherrywood/35387.article|title=Luas opens to Cherrywood|work=[[Railway Gazette International]]|date=19 October 2010|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624200436/https://www.railwaygazette.com/luas-opens-to-cherrywood/35387.article|url-status=live}}</ref> and 2011<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/minister-opens-luas-red-line-branch-to-citywest-and-saggart-1.589220|title=Minister opens Luas Red Line branch to Citywest and Saggart|newspaper=[[The Irish Times]]|first=Olivia|last=Kelly|date=2 July 2011|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210924143158/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/minister-opens-luas-red-line-branch-to-citywest-and-saggart-1.589220|url-status=live}}</ref> before a cross-city link between the lines and further extension opened in 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.tii.ie/news/press-releases/Luas%20Green%20Line%20extension/|title=Luas Green extension a major boost for Dublin|publisher=[[Transport Infrastructure Ireland]]|date=9 December 2017|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624200605/https://www.tii.ie/news/press-releases/Luas%20Green%20Line%20extension/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Historically, Dublin had an extensive [[Dublin tramways|tram system]] which commenced in 1871 and at its peak had over {{convert|97|km|mi|abbr=on}} of active line. It was operated by the [[Dublin United Transport Company]] (DUTC) and was very advanced for its day, with near-full electrification from 1901. From the 1920s onwards, the DUTC began to acquire private bus operators and gradually closed some of its lines. Further declines in passenger numbers were driven in part by a belief at the time that trams were outdated and archaic. All tram lines terminated in 1949, except for the tram to [[Howth]], which ran until 1959.

[[File:Irish Vehicle Registration Plate.svg|thumb|Example of a Dublin number plate]]
[[Dublin Bus]] is the county's largest bus operator, carrying 138 million passengers in 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nationaltransport.ie/news/massive-jump-in-passenger-journey-number-as-commuters-flock-to-public-transport/|title=Massive Jump in Passenger Journey Numbers as Commuters Flock to Public Transport|publisher=[[National Transport Authority (Ireland)|National Transport Authority]]|date=8 January 2020|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=16 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200116091114/https://www.nationaltransport.ie/news/massive-jump-in-passenger-journey-number-as-commuters-flock-to-public-transport/|url-status=live}}</ref> For much of the city, particularly west Dublin, the bus is the only public transport option available, and there are numerous smaller private bus companies in operation across County Dublin. National bus operator [[Bus Éireann]] provides long-distance routes to towns and villages located outside of Dublin city and its immediate hinterland.

In November 2005, the government announced a €34 billion initiative called [[Transport 21]] which included a substantial expansion to Dublin's transport network. The project was cancelled in May 2011 in the aftermath of the [[Post-2008 Irish economic downturn|2008 recession]]. Consequently, by 2017 Hugh Creegan, deputy chief of the NTA, stated that there had been a "''chronic underinvestment in public transport for more than a decade''".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://councilmeetings.dublincity.ie/documents/s12181/%20286%201%20Final%20Dublin%20City%20Infrastructure%20Summit%20Outcomes%20Report.pdf|title=Outcomes Report: 2017 Dublin City Infrastructure Summit|work=Dublin City Council|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624201128/https://councilmeetings.dublincity.ie/documents/s12181/%20286%201%20Final%20Dublin%20City%20Infrastructure%20Summit%20Outcomes%20Report.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> By 2019, Dublin was reportedly the 17th most congested city in the world, and had the 5th highest average commute time in the European Union.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-traffic-congestion-4985027-Jan2020/|title=Dublin is the 6th most congested city in Europe|work=journal.ie|date=29 January 2020 |access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624201502/https://www.thejournal.ie/dublin-traffic-congestion-4985027-Jan2020/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30981501.html|title=Survey puts Dublin fifth in Europe for time spent on daily commute|work=Irish Examiner|date=13 February 2020|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624201836/https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30981501.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The Luas and rail network regularly experience significant overcrowding and delays during peak hours, and in 2019 Iarnród Éireann was widely ridiculed for asking commuters to "''stagger morning journeys''" to alleviate the problem.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-rail-overcrowding-3-4950861-Jan2020/|title='Absolutely shambolic': Commuters slam Irish Rail call for Dart users to stagger morning journeys|work=journal.ie|date=2 January 2020 |access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=20 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620065756/https://www.thejournal.ie/irish-rail-overcrowding-3-4950861-Jan2020/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[M50 motorway (Ireland)|M50]] is a {{convert|45.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} orbital motorway around Dublin city, and is the busiest motorway in the country. It serves as the centre of both Dublin and Ireland's motorway network, and most of the [[national primary road]]s to other cities begin at the M50 and radiate outwards. The current route was built in various sections over the course of 27 years, from 1983 to 2010. All major roads in Ireland are managed by [[Transport Infrastructure Ireland]] (TII), which is headquartered in Parkgate Street, Dublin 8. As of 2019, there were over 550,000 cars registered in County Dublin, accounting for 25.3% of all cars registered in the State.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-tranom/transportomnibus2019/vehiclelicensingandregistrations/|title=Transport Omnibus 2019|work=CSO|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624202716/https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-tranom/transportomnibus2019/vehiclelicensingandregistrations/|url-status=live}}</ref> Due to the county's small area and high degree of urbanisation, there is a preference for "D" registered [[used cars]] throughout Ireland, as they are considered to have undergone less wear and tear.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/personal-finance/you-too-can-play-at-the-car-depreciation-game-31300584.html|title=You too can play at the car depreciation game|work=The Irish Independent|date=14 June 2015 |access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624203632/https://www.independent.ie/business/personal-finance/you-too-can-play-at-the-car-depreciation-game-31300584.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Many of Ireland's most prominent political, educational, cultural and media centres are concentrated south of the [[River Liffey]] in Dublin city. Further south, areas like [[Dún Laoghaire]], [[Dalkey]] and [[Killiney]] have long been some of Dublin's most affluent areas, and [[Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown]] consistently has the highest average house prices in Ireland. This has resulted in a perceived socio-economic divide in Dublin, between the generally less affluent [[Northside, Dublin|Northside]] and the wealthier [[Southside, Dublin|Southside]]. In Dublin (both city and county), residents will commonly refer to themselves as a "Northsider" or a "Southsider", and the division is often caricatured in Irish comedy, media and literature, for example [[Ross O'Carroll-Kelly]] and [[Damo and Ivor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/life/home-garden/dublins-cool-northside-moves-ahead-of-stuffy-southside-to-hold-the-housing-hotspots-39014486.html|title=Dublin's cool Northside moves ahead of stuffy southside to hold the housing hotspots|work=The Irish Independent|date=6 March 2020 |access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624202711/https://www.independent.ie/life/home-garden/dublins-cool-northside-moves-ahead-of-stuffy-southside-to-hold-the-housing-hotspots-39014486.html|url-status=live}}</ref> References to the divide have also become [[colloquialism]]s in their own right, such as "D4" (referring to the [[Dublin 4]] postal district), which is a pejorative term for an upper middle class Irish person.<ref name="kim-bielenberg">[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/how--dublin-4--turned-into-dublin-forlorn-1854864.html How Dublin 4 turned into Dublin forlorn] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210924143225/https://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/how-dublin-4-turned-into-dublin-forlorn-26556988.html |date=24 September 2021 }}, By Kim Bielenberg, [[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]], 8 August 2009, retrieved 17 December 2009</ref>

While the northside-southside divide remains prevalent in popular culture, [[Index (economics)|economic indices]] such as the [[Pobal#Pobal HP Deprivation Index|Pobal HP deprivation index]] have shown that the distinction does not reflect economic reality. Many of Dublin's most affluent areas ([[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]], [[Raheny]], [[Howth]], [[Portmarnock]], [[Malahide]]) are located in the north of the county, and many of its most deprived areas ([[Jobstown]], [[Ballyogan]], [[Ballybrack]], [[Dolphin's Barn]], [[Clondalkin]]) are located in the south of the county.

Utilising CSO data from the past three censuses, Pobal HP revealed that there was a much higher concentration of below average, disadvantaged and very disadvantaged areas in west Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://trutzhaase.eu/deprivation-index/the-2016-pobal-hp-deprivation-index-for-small-areas/|title=The 2016 Pobal HP Deprivation Index (SA)|work=Trutz Haase|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=6 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210106171932/http://trutzhaase.eu/deprivation-index/the-2016-pobal-hp-deprivation-index-for-small-areas/|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, [[Irish Times]] columnist [[Fintan O'Toole]] posited that the real economic divide in Dublin was not north–south, but east–west – between the older coastal areas of eastern Dublin and the newer sprawling suburbs of western Dublin – and that the perpetuation of the northside–southside "myth" was a convenient way to gloss over [[Class stratification|class division]] within the county. O'Toole argued that framing the city's wealth divide as a light-hearted north–south stereotype was easier than having to address the socio-economic impacts of deliberate government policy to [[History of Dublin#Tackling the tenements|remove working-class people from the city centre]] and settle them on the margins.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/time-to-move-beyond-the-northside-southside-myth-1.551483|title=Time to move beyond the northside-southside myth|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=7 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207005218/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/time-to-move-beyond-the-northside-southside-myth-1.551483|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dublin is both a European and Global financial hub, and around 200 of the world's leading financial services firms have operations within the county. In 2017 and 2018 respectively, Dublin was ranked 5th in Europe and 31st globally in the [[Global Financial Centres Index]] (GFCI).<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/dublin-is-ranked-fifth-in-eu-for-financial-services-35576496.html | publisher = Independent.ie | title = Dublin is ranked fifth in EU for financial services | newspaper = Independent | date = 30 March 2017 | access-date = 28 October 2018 | archive-date = 24 June 2021 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20210624201719/https://www.independent.ie/business/commercial-property/dublin-is-ranked-fifth-in-eu-for-financial-services-35576496.html | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/dublin-slips-to-31st-in-global-financial-centre-rankings-1.3440541 | publisher = Irish Times | title = Dublin slips to 31st in global financial centre rankings | date = 26 March 2018 | accessdate = 28 October 2018 | archive-date = 28 October 2018 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20181028033850/https://www.irishtimes.com/business/financial-services/dublin-slips-to-31st-in-global-financial-centre-rankings-1.3440541 | url-status = live }}</ref> In the mid-1980s, parts of central Dublin had fallen into a state of dereliction and the Irish government pursued an urban regeneration programme. An 11-hectare [[special economic zone]] (SEZ) was set up in 1987, known as the [[International Financial Services Centre, Dublin|International Financial Services Centre]] (IFSC). At the time of its establishment, the SEZ had the lowest corporate tax rate in the EU. The IFSC has since expanded into a 37.8-hectare site centred around the [[Dublin Docklands]]. As of 2020, over €1.8 trillion of funds are administered from Ireland.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/Start-a-Business-in-Ireland/Startups-from-Outside-Ireland/Key-Sectors-and-Companies-in-Ireland/Financial-Services-sector-profile.html|title=Financial Services sector profile|work=Enterprise Ireland|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624203846/https://www.enterprise-ireland.com/en/Start-a-Business-in-Ireland/Startups-from-Outside-Ireland/Key-Sectors-and-Companies-in-Ireland/Financial-Services-sector-profile.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

There was renewed interest in Dublin's financial services sector in the wake of the UK's vote to [[Brexit|withdraw from the European Union]] in 2016.

The economy of Dublin benefits from substantial amounts of both indigenous and foreign investment.

Dublin has four power plants, all of which are concentrated in the docklands area of Dublin city. Three are natural-gas plants operated by the [[ESB Group|ESB]], and the [[Poolbeg Incinerator]] is operated by [[Covanta Energy]].

As a result of Dublin city's location within a sheltered bay at the mouth of a navigable river, shipping has been a key industry in the county since medieval times. By the 18th-century, Dublin was a bustling maritime city and large-scale engineering projects were undertaken to enhance the port's capacity, such as the [[Great South Wall]], which was the largest [[sea wall]] in the world at the time of its construction in 1715.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://afloat.ie/port-news/dublin-port/item/28504-the-great-south-wall-300-years-since-idea-first-hatched|title=The Great South Wall: 300 Years Since Idea First Hatched|work=afloat.ie|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624203235/https://afloat.ie/port-news/dublin-port/item/28504-the-great-south-wall-300-years-since-idea-first-hatched|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Dublin Port]] was originally located along the Liffey, but gradually moved towards the coast over the centuries as vessel size increased.

Dublin Port occupies an area of {{convert|259|ha|acre|abbr=off}} in one of the most expensive places in the country, with an estimated price per acre of around €10 million. Since the 2000s, there have been calls to relocate Dublin Port out of the city and free up its land for residential and commercial development. This was first proposed by the [[Progressive Democrats]] at the height of the Celtic Tiger in 2006, who valued the land at between €25 and €30 billion, although nothing became of this proposal. During the housing crisis of the late 2010s the idea again began to attract supporters, among them economist [[David McWilliams (economist)|David McWilliams]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davidmcwilliams.ie/dublin-port-is-a-waste-of-space-move-it/|title=Dublin Port is a waste of space.

===Tourism===
[[File:Dublin - Guinness Storehouse - 20160507154437.jpg|thumb|The [[Guinness Storehouse]], Ireland's most visited tourist attraction]]
County Dublin receives by far the most overseas tourists of any county in Ireland. This is primarily due to Dublin city's status as Ireland's largest city and its transportation hub. Dublin is also Ireland's most popular destination for domestic tourists. According to [[Fáilte Ireland]], in 2017 Dublin received nearly 6 million overseas tourists, and just under 1.5 million domestic tourists. Most of Ireland's international flights transit through [[Dublin Airport]], and the vast majority of passenger ferry arrivals dock at Dublin Port. In 2019, the port also facilitated 158 cruise ship arrivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dublinport.ie/tofrom/cruise-liners/|title=Cruise Liners|work=Dublin Port Company|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=19 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210519142706/https://www.dublinport.ie/tofrom/cruise-liners/|url-status=live}}</ref>  The tourism industry in the county is worth approximately €2.3 billion per year.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/life/travel/travel-news/revealed-the-irish-counties-most-and-least-visited-by-tourists-37236244.html|title=Revealed: The Irish counties most (and least) visited by tourists|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624201555/https://www.independent.ie/life/travel/travel-news/revealed-the-irish-counties-most-and-least-visited-by-tourists-37236244.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

As of 2019, 4 of the top 10 fee-paying tourist attractions in Ireland are located within County Dublin, as well as 5 of the top 10 free attractions. The [[Guinness Storehouse]] at [[St. James's Gate]] is Ireland's most visited tourist attraction, receiving 1.7 million visitors in 2019, and over 20 million total visits since 2000. Additionally, Dublin also contains Ireland's 3rd ([[Dublin Zoo]]), 4th ([[Library of Trinity College Dublin|Book of Kells]]) and 6th ([[St Patrick's Cathedral, Dublin|St Patrick's Cathedral]]) most visited fee-paying attractions. The top free attractions in Dublin are the [[National Gallery of Ireland]], the [[National Botanic Gardens (Ireland)|National Botanic Gardens]], the [[National Museum of Ireland]] and the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]], all of which receive over half a million visitors per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.failteireland.ie/Utility/News-Library/Ireland%E2%80%99s-Top-Visitor-Attractions-Revealed-(1).aspx|title=Ireland's Top Visitor Attractions Revealed|work=Fáilte Ireland|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624201308/https://www.failteireland.ie/Utility/News-Library/Ireland%E2%80%99s-Top-Visitor-Attractions-Revealed-(1).aspx|url-status=live}}</ref>

Despite having the smallest farmed area of any county, Dublin is one of Ireland's major agricultural producers. Dublin is the largest producer of fruit and vegetables in Ireland, the third largest producer of oilseed rape and has the fifth largest [[fishing industry]]. Fingal alone produces 55% of Ireland's fresh produce, including soft fruits and berries, apples, lettuces, peppers, asparagus, potatoes, onions, and carrots. As of 2020, the [[Irish Farmers' Association]] estimates that the total value of Dublin's agricultural produce is €205 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ifa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dublin.pdf|title=Importance of Farming and the Agri-food Industry – Dublin|work=The Irish Farmers' Association|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624204346/https://www.ifa.ie/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Dublin.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>  According to the CSO, fish landings in the county are worth a further €20 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/fl/fishlandings2019/|title=Fish Landings 2019|work=CSO|date=24 July 2020 |access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624203923/https://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/er/fl/fishlandings2019/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Approximately 41% of the county's land area (38,576 ha) is farmed. Of this, {{convert|12578|ha|0|abbr=on}} is under [[tillage]], the 9th highest in the country, and {{convert|6500|ha|0|abbr=on}} is dedicated to fruit & horticulture, the 4th highest. Rural County Dublin is considered a peri-urban region, where an urban environment transitions into a rural one. Due to the growth of Dublin city and its commuter towns in the north of the county, the region is considered to be under significant pressure from [[urban sprawl]]. Between 1991 and 2010, the amount of agricultural land within the county decreased by 22.9%. In 2015, the local authorities of Fingal, South Dublin and Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown developed a joint Dublin Rural Local Development Strategy aimed at enhancing the region's agricultural output, while also managing and minimising the impact of urbanisation on biodiversity and the identity and culture of rural Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://assets.gov.ie/2803/151118103209-0ebf8fdc042846a7bc1cbc066566d1b7.pdf|title=Dublin Rural LEADER LDS Strategy|work=gov.ie|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624201854/https://assets.gov.ie/2803/151118103209-0ebf8fdc042846a7bc1cbc066566d1b7.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

The county has a small forestry industry that is based almost entirely in the upland areas of south County Dublin. According to the 2017 National Forestry Inventory, {{convert|6011|ha|0|abbr=on}} of the county was under forest, of which {{convert|1912|ha|0|abbr=on}} was private forestry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/65294-irelands-national-forest-inventory/|title=Second National Forestry Inventory|work=DAFM|date=17 November 2020 |access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=20 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620124029/https://www.gov.ie/en/publication/65294-irelands-national-forest-inventory/|url-status=live}}</ref>  The majority of Dublin's forests are owned by the national forestry company, [[Coillte]]. In the absence of increased private planting, the county's commercial timber capacity is expected to decrease in the coming decades, as Coillte intends to convert much of their holdings in the [[Dublin Mountains]] into non-commercial mixed forests.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/question/2020-09-24/285/|title=Coillte Teoranta: Dáil Éireann Debate, Thursday – 24 September 2020|work=oireachtas.ie|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624203605/https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/debates/question/2020-09-24/285/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Dublin has 810 individual farms with an average size of {{convert|47.6|ha|0|abbr=on}}, the largest average farm size of any county in Ireland. Roughly 9,400 people within the county are directly employed in either agriculture or the food and drink processing industry. Numerous Irish and multinational food and drink companies are either based in Dublin or have facilities within the county, including [[Mondelez International|Mondelez]], [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[Mars, Incorporated|Mars]], [[Diageo]], [[Kellogg's]], [[Danone]], [[Ornua]], [[Pernod Ricard]] and [[Glanbia]]. In 1954, [[Tayto (Republic of Ireland)|Tayto Crisps]] were established in [[Coolock]] and developed into cultural phenomenon throughout much of the Republic of Ireland.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2009/0620/1224249169681.html | date=6 June 2009 | first=Brian | last=O'Connell | title=Two packets of Tayto and a bottle of TK ... | newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] | access-date=20 June 2021 | archive-date=20 October 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020202308/http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2009/0620/1224249169681.html | url-status=live }}</ref> Its operations and headquarters have since moved to neighbouring [[County Meath]].

In Ireland, spending on education is controlled by the government and the allocation of funds is decided each year in the annual budget. Local authorities retain limited responsibilities such as funding for school meals, service supports costs and the upkeep of libraries.

There are hundreds of primary and secondary schools within County Dublin, most of which are English-language schools. Several international schools are based in Dublin, such as [[St Kilian's German School]] and [[Lycée Français d'Irlande]], which teach in foreign languages. There is also a large minority of students attending [[gaelscoil]]eanna (Irish-language primary schools). There are 34 gaelscoileanna and 10 [[Gaelcholáiste|gaelcholáistí]] (Irish-language secondary schools) in the county, with a total of 12,950 students as of 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/files/Education-through-Irish.pdf|title=Education through the Medium of Irish 2015/2016|year=2016|publisher=gaelscoileanna.ie|accessdate=1 January 2018|archive-date=1 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180101135552/http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/files/Education-through-Irish.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> In terms of college acceptance rates, gaelcholáistí are consistently the best performing schools in Dublin, and among the best performing in Ireland.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/fee-paying-and-gaelscoil-students-most-likely-to-go-to-university-1.1384339|title=Fee-paying and Gaelscoil students most likely to go to university|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=5 October 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141005044305/http://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/fee-paying-and-gaelscoil-students-most-likely-to-go-to-university-1.1384339|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although the government pays for a large majority of school costs, including teachers' salaries, the Roman Catholic Church is the largest owner of schools in Dublin, and preference is given to Catholic students over non-Catholic students in oversubscribed areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/School-Enrolment/submissions-from-education-partners/cpsma.pdf|title=The role of denominational religion in the school admissions process and possible approaches for making changes|work=Catholic Primary Schools Management Association|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624202508/https://www.education.ie/en/Parents/Information/School-Enrolment/submissions-from-education-partners/cpsma.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> This has resulted in a growing movement towards non-denominational and [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational]] schools in the county.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/10/ireland-secularise-schools-catholic-dublin-divestment|title=Ireland's attempts to secularise its schools have turned to farce|work=The Guardian|date=10 April 2019 |access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=24 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624203212/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/apr/10/ireland-secularise-schools-catholic-dublin-divestment|url-status=live}}</ref>

The majority of [[Independent school#Ireland|private secondary schools]] in Dublin are still single sex, and continue to have religious patronages with either congregations of the Catholic Church ([[Congregation of the Holy Spirit|Spiritans]], [[Sisters of Loreto]], [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]) or Protestant denominations ([[Church of Ireland]], [[Presbyterian]]). Newer private schools which cater for the [[Leaving Certificate (Ireland)|Leaving Cert]] cycle such as the [[Institute of Education (Dublin)|Institute of Education]] and [[Ashfield College]] are generally non-denominational and co-educational. In 2018, [[Nord Anglia International School Dublin]] opened in [[Leopardstown]], becoming the most expensive private school in Ireland.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/inside-nord-anglia-ireland-s-most-expensive-school-1.3637169?mode=sample&auth-failed=1&pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fnews%2Feducation%2Finside-nord-anglia-ireland-s-most-expensive-school-1.3637169|title=Inside Nord Anglia: Ireland's most expensive school|newspaper=The Irish Times|access-date=20 June 2021|archive-date=30 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630022622/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/inside-nord-anglia-ireland-s-most-expensive-school-1.3637169?mode=sample&auth-failed=1&pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fnews%2Feducation%2Finside-nord-anglia-ireland-s-most-expensive-school-1.3637169|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Elections===
[[File:Dublin Dail Eireann Constituencies (2020).png|thumb|[[Dáil constituencies]] of County Dublin]]
For elections to [[Dáil Éireann]], the area of the county is currently divided into eleven [[Dáil constituencies|constituencies]]: [[Dublin Bay North (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Bay North]], [[Dublin Bay South (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Bay South]], [[Dublin Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Central]], [[Dublin Fingal (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Fingal]], [[Dublin Mid-West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Mid-West]], [[Dublin North-West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin North-West]], [[Dublin Rathdown (Dáil constituency)|Dublin Rathdown]], [[Dublin South-Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South-Central]], [[Dublin South-West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South-West]], [[Dublin West (Dáil constituency)|Dublin West]], and [[Dún Laoghaire (Dáil constituency)|Dún Laoghaire]]. Together they return 45 deputies ([[Teachta Dála|TDs]]) to the Dáil.

The first [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]] convened in the small village of [[Castledermot]], [[County Kildare]] on 18 June 1264. Representatives from seven constituencies were present, one of which was the constituency of [[Dublin City (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin City]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/visit-and-learn/history-and-buildings/history-of-parliament-in-ireland/|title=History of Parliament in Ireland|work=oireachtas.ie|date=23 June 2021|access-date=25 June 2021|archive-date=29 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200329185418/https://www.oireachtas.ie/en/visit-and-learn/history-and-buildings/history-of-parliament-in-ireland/|url-status=live}}</ref> Dublin was historically represented in the [[Irish House of Commons]] through the constituencies of [[Dublin City (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Dublin City]] and [[County Dublin (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|County Dublin]]. Three smaller constituencies had been created by the 17th century: [[Swords (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Swords]]; which was created sometime between 1560 and 1585, with Walter Fitzsimons and Thomas Taylor being its first recorded [[Irish House of Commons|MPs]]; [[Newcastle (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Newcastle]] in the west of the county, created in 1613; and [[Dublin University (constituency)|Dublin University]], which was a [[university constituency]] covering Trinity College, also created in 1613.<ref name=MP>{{Cite thesis|url=http://www.tara.tcd.ie/handle/2262/77206|hdl=2262/77206|title=A biographical dictionary of the membership of the Irish House of Commons 1640–1641|year=1998|publisher=Trinity College (Dublin, Ireland).

Following the [[Acts of Union 1800]], Dublin was represented in [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|Westminster]] through three constituencies from 1801 to 1885: [[Dublin City (UK Parliament constituency)|Dublin City]], [[County Dublin (UK Parliament constituency)|County Dublin]] and the [[Dublin University (constituency)|Dublin University]]. A series of local government and electoral reforms in the late 19th century radically alerted the county's political map, and by 1918 there were twelve constituencies within County Dublin.<ref name=gailey>{{cite journal |last1=Gailey |first1=Andrew |date=May 1984 |title=Unionist Rhetoric and Irish Local Government Reform, 1895-9 |journal=Irish Historic Studies |volume=24 |issue=93 |pages=52–68 |jstor=30008026 |doi= 10.1017/S0021121400034027|s2cid=159923053 }}</ref>

Throughout the twentieth century the representation in Dublin expanded as the population grew. In the [[Electoral Act 1923]], the first division of constituencies arranged by Irish legislation, geographical constituencies in Dublin were 23 of the 147 TDs in geographical constituencies;<ref>{{cite ISB|year=1923|num=12|title=[[Electoral Act 1923]]|date=17 April 1923|access-date=10 October 2021|parl=ifs|schedno=8|stitle=Constituencies}}</ref> this contrasts with 45 of 160 at the most recent division.<ref>{{cite ISB|year=2017|num=39|schedule=y|title=[[Electoral (Amendment) (Dáil Constituencies) Act 2017]]|date=23 December 2017|access-date=8 August 2021}}</ref>

Twenty-three [[Dáil Éireann]] constituencies have been created and abolished within the county since independence, the most recent being the constituencies of [[Dublin South (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South]], [[Dublin North (Dáil constituency)|Dublin North]], [[Dublin North-Central (Dáil constituency)|Dublin North-Central]], [[Dublin North-East (Dáil constituency)|Dublin North-East]] and [[Dublin South-East (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South-East]], which were abolished in 2016.

Of the fifteen people to have held the office of [[Taoiseach]] since 1922, more than half were either born or raised within County Dublin: [[W. T. Cosgrave]], [[John A. Costello]], [[Seán Lemass]], [[Liam Cosgrave]], [[Charles Haughey]] (born in [[County Mayo]] but raised in Dublin), [[Garret FitzGerald]], [[Bertie Ahern]] and [[Leo Varadkar]] (Cosgrave held the office of [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]]; by convention, Taoisigh are numbered to include this position). Conversely, just one of Ireland's nine [[President of Ireland|presidents]] have hailed from the county, namely [[Seán T. O'Kelly]], who served as president from 1945 to 1959.

====European Elections====
The four local government areas in County Dublin form the 4-seat constituency of [[Dublin (European Parliament constituency)|Dublin]] in [[European Parliament elections]].<ref>{{cite ISB|year=2019|num=7|section=7|stitle=Substitution of Third Schedule to Principal Act |title=European Parliament Elections (Amendment) Act 2019|date=12 March 2019|access-date=21 December 2021}}</ref>

===National Government===

[[File:Barack Obama and Enda Kenny at Farmleigh.jpg|right|thumb|[[Farmleigh]], the official Irish State guesthouse]]
As the capital city, Dublin is the seat of the national parliament of Ireland, the [[Oireachtas]]. It is composed of the [[President of Ireland]], [[Dáil Éireann]] as a house of representatives, and [[Seanad Éireann]] as an upper house. Both houses of the Oireachtas meet in [[Leinster House]], a former ducal palace on [[Kildare Street]]. It has been the home of the Irish government since the creation of the [[Irish Free State]]. The [[First Dáil]] of the revolutionary [[Irish Republic]] met in the Round Room of the [[Mansion House, Dublin|Mansion House]], the present-day residence of the [[Lord Mayor of Dublin]], in January 1919. The former [[Parliament of Ireland|Irish Parliament]], which was abolished in 1801, was located at [[College Green, Dublin|College Green]]; [[Parliament House, Dublin|Parliament House]] now holds a branch of [[Bank of Ireland]]. [[Government Buildings]], located on [[Merrion Street]], houses the [[Department of the Taoiseach]], the Council Chamber, the [[Department of Finance (Ireland)|Department of Finance]], and the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Office of the Attorney General]].<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Department of the Taoiseach |title=Guide to Government Buildings |year=2005}}</ref>

The president resides in [[Áras an Uachtaráin]] in [[Phoenix Park]], a stately ranger's lodge built in 1757. The house was bought by [[the Crown]] in 1780 to be used as the summer residence of the [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland]], the British [[viceroy]] in the [[Kingdom of Ireland]]. Following independence, the lodge was earmarked as the potential home of the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]], but this was highly controversial as it symbolised continued British rule over Ireland, so it was left empty for many years. President [[Douglas Hyde]] "temporarily" occupied the building in 1938, as Taoiseach [[Éamon de Valera]] intended to demolish it and build a more modest presidential bungalow on the site. Those plans were scrapped during [[The Emergency (Ireland)|The Emergency]] and the lodge became the president's permanent residence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-aras-accidentally-home-to-the-president-1.163019|title=The Aras: accidentally home to the President|publisher=The Irish Times|access-date=25 June 2021|date=13 June 1998|archive-date=24 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210924143159/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/the-aras-accidentally-home-to-the-president-1.163019|url-status=live}}</ref>

Much like Áras an Uachtaráin, many of the grand estate homes of the former aristocracy were re-purposed for State use in the 20th century. The [[Deerfield Residence]], also in Phoenix Park, is the official residence of the [[United States Ambassador to Ireland]], while [[Glencairn House]] in south Dublin is used as the [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to Ireland|British Ambassador's]] residence. [[Farmleigh|Farmleigh House]], one of the [[Guinness family]] residences, was acquired by the government in 1999 for use as the official [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] [[state guest house]].

Many other prominent judicial and political organs are located within Dublin, including the [[Four Courts]], which is the principal seat of the [[Supreme Court of Ireland|Supreme Court]], the [[Court of Appeal (Ireland)|Court of Appeal]], the [[High Court (Ireland)|High Court]] and the [[Circuit Court (Ireland)|Dublin Circuit Court]]; and the [[The Custom House|Custom House]], which houses the [[Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage]]. Once the centuries-long seat of the [[Dublin Castle administration|British government's administration in Ireland]], [[Dublin Castle]] is now only used for ceremonial purposes, such as policy launches, hosting of State visits, and the [[Irish presidential inauguration|inauguration of the president]].<ref name= costello>{{cite book|last= Costello|first= Peter|year= 1999|title= Dublin Castle, in the life of the Irish nation|publisher= Wolfhound Press|location= Dublin|isbn= 0-86327-610-5|url-access= registration|url= https://archive.org/details/dublincastleinli00cost}}</ref>

===Social issues and ideology===
Dublin is among the most socially liberal places in Ireland, and popular sentiment on issues such as [[LGBT rights in the Republic of Ireland|LGBT rights]], [[abortion]] and divorce has often foreran the rest of the island. Referendums held on these issues have consistently received much stronger support within Dublin, particularly the south of the county, than the majority of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/most-liberal-constituency-turns-out-in-style-and-gets-it-right-again-26031698.html|title=Most liberal constituency turns out in style and gets it right again|publisher=The Irish Independent|access-date=25 June 2021|date=21 October 2002|archive-date=25 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625161203/https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/most-liberal-constituency-turns-out-in-style-and-gets-it-right-again-26031698.html|url-status=live}}</ref> While over 66% of voters nationally voted in favour of the [[Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|Eighth Amendment]] in 1983, 58% of voters in [[Dún Laoghaire (Dáil constituency)|Dún Laoghaire]] and 55% in [[Dublin South (Dáil constituency)|Dublin South]] voted against it. In 2018, over 75.5% of voters in County Dublin voted to [[Thirty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|repeal]] the amendment, compared with 66.4% nationally.

In 1987, Dublin Senator [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]] took the Irish government to the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (see ''[[Norris v. Ireland]]'') over the criminalisation of homosexual acts. In 1988, the Court ruled that the law criminalising same sex activities was contrary to the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], in particular Article 8 which protects the right to respect for private life. The law was held to infringe on the right of adults to engage in acts of their own choice.<ref>Norris v. Ireland – 10581/83 (European Court of Human Rights)</ref> This led directly to the repeal of the law in 1993. Numerous LGBT events and venues are now located within the county. [[Dublin Pride]] is an annual [[pride parade]] held on the last Saturday of June and is Ireland's largest public LGBT event. In 2018, an estimated 60,000 people attended.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/record-numbers-attend-dublin-pride-parade-1.3549866|title=Record numbers attend Dublin Pride Parade|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=30 June 2018|last=Gallagher|first=Conor|access-date=25 June 2021|archive-date=11 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411125905/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/ireland/irish-news/record-numbers-attend-dublin-pride-parade-1.3549866|url-status=live}}</ref> During the [[Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|2015 vote]] to allow same-sex marriage, 71% of County Dublin voted in favour, compared with 62% nationally.

In general, the south-eastern coastal regions of the county such as Dún Laoghaire and Dublin Bay South are a stronghold for the [[Liberal conservatism|liberal-conservative]] [[Fine Gael]] party.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cora.ucc.ie/bitstream/handle/10468/9999/Full%20Text%20E-thesis.pdf?sequence=3|title=Keeping it local: an investigation of the phenomenon of 'friends and neighbours' voting at the Irish general elections of 2011 and 2016|publisher=UCC|access-date=25 June 2021|date=4 October 2019|archive-date=25 June 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625161215/https://cora.ucc.ie/bitstream/handle/10468/9999/Full%20Text%20E-thesis.pdf?sequence=3|url-status=live}}</ref> Since the late-2000s the [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] has also developed a strong support base in these areas.

Dublin is a [[dual county]] in [[Gaelic games]], and it competes at a similar level in both [[hurling]]/[[camogie]] and [[Gaelic football]]. The [[Dublin GAA|Dublin county board]] is the governing body for Gaelic games within the county. The county's current GAA crest, adopted in 2004, represents Dublin's four constituent areas. The castle represents Dublin city, the [[Crow (heraldry)|raven]] represents Fingal, the Viking longboat represents Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown and the [[Máel Ruain|book of Saint Tamhlacht]] in the centre represents South Dublin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dublingaa.ie/history/history-of-crest|title=History of the Crest|publisher=Dublin GAA|date=23 July 2017|accessdate=9 August 2021|archive-date=9 March 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309232816/https://www.dublingaa.ie/history/history-of-crest|url-status=live}}</ref>

In Gaelic football, the [[Dublin county football team|Dublin county team]] competes annually in Division 1 of the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] and the provincial [[Leinster Senior Football Championship]]. Dublin is the dominant force of [[Leinster GAA|Leinster]] football, with [[Leinster Senior Football Championship#Roll of honour|62]] Leinster Senior Championship wins. Nationally, the county is second only to [[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] for [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]] titles. The two counties are [[Dublin–Kerry Gaelic football rivalry|fierce rivals]], and a meeting between them is considered the biggest game in Gaelic football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/kerry-pioneers-the-kings-of-the-urban-rural-frontier-1.602387|title=Kerry pioneers the kings of the urban-rural frontier|publisher=Irish Times|date=17 September 2011|accessdate=20 March 2016|first=Seán|last=Moran|archive-date=1 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401110119/http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/kerry-pioneers-the-kings-of-the-urban-rural-frontier-1.602387|url-status=live}}</ref>  Dublin has won the All-Ireland on [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship records and statistics|31]] occasions, including a record 6 in a row from 2015 to 2020.

In hurling, the [[Dublin county hurling team|Dublin hurling team]] currently compete in Division 1B of the [[National Hurling League]] and in the [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship]]. Dublin is the second most successful hurling county in Leinster after [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]], albeit a distant second, with [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship records and statistics|24]] Leinster hurling titles. The county has seen less success in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]], ranking joint-fifth alongside [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]]. Dublin has been in 21 All-Ireland hurling finals, winning just [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship records and statistics|6]], the most recent of which was in 1938.
