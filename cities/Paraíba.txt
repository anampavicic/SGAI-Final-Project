'''Paraíba''' ([[Tupi language|Tupi]]: ''pa'ra a'íba''; {{IPA|pt-BR|paɾaˈibɐ|-|pt-br Paraíba.ogg}}) is a [[states of Brazil|state]] of [[Brazil]]. It is located in the [[Brazilian Northeast]], and it is bordered by [[Rio Grande do Norte]] to the north, [[Ceará]] to the west, [[Pernambuco]] to the south and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east. Paraíba is the third most densely populated state of the Northeast; [[João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa]], the sea-bordered state capital, and [[Campina Grande]], in the interior, rank among the fifteen-largest [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipalities]] in the Northeast of Brazil. The state is home to 1.9% of the Brazilian population and produces 0.9% of the Brazilian [[GDP]].

Paraíba is most populated along the Atlantic coast, which extends as far as [[Ponta do Seixas]], the easternmost point of the [[Americas]]. The state is a tourist and industrial hotspot; it is known for its cultural heritage, amenable climate and geographical features, ranging from the seaside beaches to the [[Borborema Plateau]]. It is named after the [[Paraíba do Norte River|Paraíba river]].

Some of the most notable Brazilian writers and poets are from Paraíba like [[Augusto dos Anjos]], [[José Américo de Almeida]], [[José Lins do Rego]], [[Ariano Suassuna]] and [[Pedro Américo]], the last being also known for his historical paintings.

==History==
{{Further information|History of Paraíba}}

Before Europeans arrived in Brazil, the territory that is now the state of Paraíba was home to numerous indigenous tribes. Between the coast and the [[Borborema Plateau]], the main indigenous group was the [[Potiguara]] (part of the larger [[Tupi people|Tupi]] group), who lived along the [[Paraíba do Norte river]]. The [[Kiriri people|Kiriri]] and [[Ariús]] groups, meanwhile, lived further to the west, occupying the region between the Borborema Plateau and the [[sertão]].<ref>{{cite book|author=José Octávio Arruda Mello|title=História da Paraíba: lutas e resistência|publisher=Editora Universitária|year=1997|page=279}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ihgp.net/pb500i.htm|title=As nações indígenas da Paraíba|author=José Elias Borges Barbosa|date=2004|publisher=Instituto Histórico e Geográfico Paraibano|access-date=2014-06-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230718223439/https://www.ihgp.net/livros/a-paraiba-nos-500-anos-do-brasil/i.php|archive-date=2023-07-18}}</ref>

=== Colonization and conquest ===

[[File:Novo mapa Capitanias.jpg|thumb|Map of the captaincies of Brazil in 1534]]

In 1500, the Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]] reached the northeastern coast of Brazil and claimed the territory of Brazil for the [[Portuguese Empire]] as set out in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]]. It was not until 1534, however, that colonization began, spurred on by the increasing [[France|French]] presence in the Northeast. In that same year, the King of Portugal, [[John III of Portugal|John III]], divided Brazil into fifteen [[Captaincies of Brazil|captaincies]]. Most of what is now the state of Paraíba became part of the [[Captaincy of Itamaracá]], which comprised a thin band of area stretching from the Tordesillas line at the far western extremity to the [[Ponta do Seixas]], the easternmost point of Brazil. The remaining portions of the state fell under the neighboring captaincies of Rio Grande to the north and Pernambuco to the south. Itamaracá, in contrast to [[Pernambuco]], continued to be troubled by French [[piracy]], especially of wood, animal skins, and [[amber]].<ref name="mello-2008">{{cite book |title=História da Paraíba |edition=11 |last1=Mello |first1=José Octávio de Arruda |date=2008 |location=João Pessoa |publisher=A União|language=pt-br}}</ref><ref name="Mello_v2">{{cite book|last1=MELLO|first1=José Octávio de Arruda|title=2 A ocupação do litoral e as bases da colonização paraibana|publisher=A União|page=22|language=pt-br}}</ref>

Convents, churches, and sugar mills began to sprout up in the captaincy as the colonial population grew. Where once the Portuguese had had a relatively conciliatory relationship with the Tupi people, due in part to their usefulness as allies against other European powers (the French, Dutch, and Spanish), as well as to other hostile indigenous peoples, the growth of the colonies sparked tensions. The principal reasons for heightened tensions were the encroachment of settlers on indigenous territory, driven by the establishment of [[sugarcane]] plantations and the increasing nutritional needs of a larger population; the new compulsory labor relations imposed by the Portuguese, which implied the abandonment of the indigenous agricultural production system, essential for the survival of the villages; and the fact that though they were banned from attacking Portuguese settlements, their own villages were subject to attacks from settlers searching for slave labor.<ref>{{cite web|author=Maria Hilda Baqueiro Paraiso|year=2012|title=Revoltas indígenas, a criação do governo geral e o regimento de 1548|url=https://periodicos.ufpe.br/revistas/revistaclio/article/viewFile/24297/19701|publisher=CLIO – Revista de Pesquisa Histórica}}</ref> Eventually, the tensions came to a head when the Potiguara people, urged on by the French, gathered around 2,000 tribesmen from Paraíba and Rio Grande and attacked the Tracunhaém plantation in 1574, killing all residents. The event had powerful reverberations in [[Lisbon]], leading to [[Henry, King of Portugal|King Henry]] creating the Royal [[Captaincy of Paraíba]], which was subordinate directly to the Portuguese Crown.<ref name="mello-2008"/><ref name="Mello_v2"/> The "Tragedy of Tracunhaém" also served as the trigger for the [[Potiguara War]], which lasted from 1574 to 1599.
[[File:Brasão da Capitania da Paraíba.jpg|thumb|left|Coat of arms of the Captaincy of Paraíba]]

Though it was officially created in 1574, the Captaincy of Paraíba was only made reality eleven years after the fact. In 1572, Luís de Brito was named the governor-general of the country and the governor of the northern captaincies, including Itamaracá. He received from the King the order to punish those responsible for the Tracunhaém attack and create a new city to serve as the governor's seat. Brito's expedition, as well as the next three attempts, ended in failure. Finally, in 1584, the new governor-general, Manuel Teles Barreto, mounted a successful expedition with the help of the captain-major of the captaincy, Frutuoso Barbosa, and the fleet of Admiral D. Diogo Flores de Valdés.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |title=Catálogo de Documentos Manuscritos Avulsos referentes à capitania da Paraíba, existentes no Arquivo Histórico Ultramarino de Lisboa |publisher=Ed.

The Tabajara joined the Portuguese and together they chased the Potiguara from the area, thereby completing their original mission. Having now conquered Paraíba, the colonists established the first Royal City in Brazil under the [[Philippine Dynasty]] in 1585, named "Filipeia de Nossa Senhora das Neves" (today the capital of Paraíba, [[João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa]]). Additionally, to repel French invaders, they constructed the ''Forte de São Tiago'' on the edge of the Paraíba do Norte river.<ref name="mello-2008"/><ref name="Mello_v2"/>

=== Dutch invasion ===

Owing to its lucrative sugarcane industry, the Captaincy of Paraíba proved to be one of the most economically successful regions in Portuguese America, alongside Pernambuco and [[Bahia]].<ref name=":0"/> Because of this, the Dutch were interested in claiming the Northeast region and first attempted to do so in 1624 by seizing the then-capital city of Brazil, [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], in Bahia. Following their expulsion from Salvador, the Dutch made their first appearance on Paraíban territory on June 20, 1625,<ref name="hulsman-2006">{{cite journal |title=Índios do Brasil na República dos Países Baixos: as representações de Antônio Paraupaba para os estados gerais em 1654 e 1656 |first1=Lodewijk |last1=Hulsman |journal=Revista de História |year=2006 |issue=154 |pages=37–69 |url=https://www.redalyc.org/articulo.oa?id=285022043004|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230718224545/https://www.redalyc.org/pdf/2850/285022043004.pdf|archive-date=2023-07-18}}</ref> when they arrived in the [[Baía da Traição|Bay of Traição]] to treat their sick<ref>{{cite web |url=http://adcon.rn.gov.br/ACERVO/secretaria_extraordinaria_de_cultura/DOC/DOC000000000107147.PDF |title=Domínio Holandês |author=Fundação José Augusto |date=2016-03-07 |access-date=2016-12-27 |publisher=Fundação José Augusto|language=pt-br}}</ref> and bury their dead.<ref name="hulsman-2006"/> The Dutch Admiral, Boudewijn Hendricksz, quickly formed an alliance with the Potiguaras, promising them protection in return for military support against the Portuguese.<ref name="hulsman-2006" /> The governor of Paraíba, Antônio de Albuquerque, sent troops to drive away the invaders. Seven companies of men from the Captaincy of Paraíba, the Captaincy of Pernambuco, the Captaincy of Rio Grande, and from indigenous tribes succeeded in defeating the Dutch on August 1, at least for the time being.<ref name="donato-1996">{{cite book |title=Dicionário das batalhas brasileiras |first1=Hernâni |last1=Donato |year=1996 |edition=2 |publisher=Ibrasa |location=[[São Paulo (cidade)|São Paulo]] |page=549|language=pt-br}}</ref> Hendricksz was able to escape, fleeing to [[Puerto Rico]]. During the battle, however, the Potiguaras suffered heavy losses of 600 to a thousand dead.<ref name="hulsman-2006" /><ref name="donato-1996" />

On December 5, 1632, 1,600 Dutchmen landed on Paraíban shores. After undergoing fire from the Portuguese, they began digging trenches in front of the [[Forte de Santa Catarina]], located in [[Cabedelo]], 18&nbsp;km away from the center of Filipeia de Nossa Senhora das Neves (João Pessoa). Despite this stand, the Dutch once again proved unable to seize Paraíba and they were forced to retreat to Pernambuco,<ref name="História_PMPB">{{cite web|url=http://www.pm.pb.gov.br/arquivos/Historia_da_Paraiba.pdf|title=História da Paraíba|author=Leandro de Lima Lira|publisher=Polícia Militar da Paraíba|access-date=2013-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823210022/http://www.pm.pb.gov.br/arquivos/Historia_da_Paraiba.pdf|archive-date=2009-08-23|language=pt-br}}</ref><ref name="Paraíba_História">{{cite web|access-date=2013-06-09|publisher=Portal Paraíba Total|url=http://www.paraibatotal.com.br/a-paraiba/historia|title=História da Paraíba|language=pt-br}}</ref> which they had already conquered in 1630.<ref name="Dutch-Invasion">{{Citation |last=Flores Fernandes Araújo |first=Hugo André |title=The Insurrection of Pernambuco and the Surrender of the Dutch in Brazil (1645–1654) |date=2022-01-28 |url=https://oxfordre.com/latinamericanhistory/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.001.0001/acrefore-9780199366439-e-1031 |encyclopedia=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Latin American History |access-date=2023-07-18 |publisher=Oxford University Press |language=en |doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780199366439.013.1031 |isbn=978-0-19-936643-9}}</ref>

The Dutch attempted the invasion anew on November 25, 1634, with the arrival of a squadron of 29 ships on the coast of Paraíba. Though reinforcements were sent to Paraíba from as far as Europe to repel the Dutch, the Portuguese had already been too weakened, and allowed the Forte de Santa Catarina and the Forte de Santo Antônio to fall into the hands of the Dutch. The Dutch then went to Filipeia de Nossa Senhora das Neves in search of Governor Antônio de Albuquerque, who was in command of the Portuguese troops. On Christmas Eve, they entered the city, but did not find Albuquerque; instead, they found empty streets and abandoned homes, a shell of the former city. With that final nail in the coffin — despite some ongoing resistance from the local population —<ref name="História_PMPB"/> the Dutch had finally conquered Paraíba. After [[Dutch Brazil|the Dutch invasion]], the sugarcane economy, the principal industry of the region, was devastated, as many sugarcane plantations on the coast had been set on fire.<ref name="Mello_v4"/> It was not until 1654, two decades later, that the Portuguese would finally retake Paraíba.<ref name="Dutch-Invasion"/>

=== Expansion ===
[[File:View of Frederiksstad in Paraiba, Brazil 1638 Frans Post.jpg|thumb|''Frederiksstad'', modern-day [[João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa]], in 1638, by [[Frans Post]]]]
Until 1670, colonial occupation of Paraíba had mostly been restricted to the east, near the coast, but from that point forward, colonists started pushing further into the interior.<ref name="Mello_v4"/> Much of these efforts were carried out by fortune-seeking explorers called [[bandeirantes]], led by [[Domingos Jorge Velho]]. This expansion resulted in conflicts with the indigenous tribes of the region, including the enslavement and massacre of indigenous peoples.<ref name="Mello_v4">{{cite book|author=José Octávio de Arruda Mello|display-authors=et al.|title=4 O Espaço Sertanejo: Deslocamento da fronteira e massacre dos indígenas|publisher=A União|page=22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Trajetórias políticas de povos indígenas e índios aldeados na Capitania da Paraíba durante o século XVIII |author=Ricardo Medeiros |date=2009 |publisher=XXV Simpósio Nacional de História |url=http://anais.anpuh.org/wp-content/uploads/mp/pdf/ANPUH.S25.0568.pdf |access-date=2016-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221040503/http://anais.anpuh.org/wp-content/uploads/mp/pdf/ANPUH.S25.0568.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|language=pt-br}}</ref>

Western expansion was also spearheaded by Catholic missionaries, who sought to convert the local indigenous population. One of the most important missionaries of this time was the priest Martim Nantes, who founded the village of [[Pilar, Paraíba|Pilar]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=O Padre Martin de Nautes e o Cel.

On January 1, 1756, the Captaincy of Paraíba was dissolved and annexed to Pernambuco. This lasted until 1799, when it became the Captaincy of Paraíba again.<ref>{{cite book|author=Confraria do IAHGP|title=Revista, volume 21, edições 103-106|publisher=Instituto Arqueológico, Histórico e Geográfico Pernambucano (IAHGP)|year=1919|language=pt-br}}</ref> At this time, some minor adjustments were made to Paraíba's borders, with a portion of its northern territory being given to [[Rio Grande do Norte]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tribunadonorte.com.br/especial/histrn/hist_rn_6f.htm|title=Repercussões no Rio Grande do Norte|publisher=Tribuna do Norte|access-date=2016-12-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010703033718/http://www.tribunadonorte.com.br/especial/histrn/hist_rn_6f.htm|archive-date=2001-07-03|url-status=dead|language=pt-br}}</ref>

=== Revolt ===

Throughout its history, Paraíba participated in various revolts. The [[Pernambucan revolt|Pernambuco Revolution of 1817]] stands out as an example; inspired by the [[American Revolutionary War|War of Independence]] in the [[United States]] and the [[French Revolution]], its objective was to make Brazil an independent country. From its origins in Pernambuco, the revolution spread to the entire Northeast. In Paraíba, the movement arose in the southern municipality of Itabaiana and fanned out to the [[agreste]], sertão, and coast. The movement proved unsuccessful, though the struggle for independence continued on afterwards. The following five years (1818–1822) were marked by clashes between two rival factions: the cajás, also called patriots, who were revolutionaries, and the carambolas (realists), who were counterrevolutionaries.<ref name="Mello_v6">{{cite book|last1=Mello|first1=José Octávio de Arruda|title=6 Modelo de Independência e Revoluções Liberais|publisher=A União|page=22|language=pt-br}}</ref>

In 1822, Brazil finally became an independent country and Paraíba was turned into a province of the [[Empire of Brazil|Brazilian Empire]] of King [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]]. Two years later, Paraíba was implicated in the [[Confederation of the Equator]], which was an anti-authoritarian movement that started in Pernambuco. The movement was suppressed by Imperial forces, with some of the leaders sentenced to execution.<ref name="Mello_v6"/>

Inspired by the [[Revolutions of 1848|various revolutions]] that took place in Europe in 1848, the [[Praieira Revolt]] was organized in Pernambuco at the end of that same year. It arrived in Paraíba in February 1849, led by Maximiano Machado and Borges da Fonseca, demanding various social and economic reforms, such as land ownership changes, democracy, and freedom of the press.<ref name="Mello_v6"/> The revolt only lasted for about five months and ended in failure. Three years later, in 1851, Paraíba and its neighboring provinces became involved in the Ronco da Abelha revolt. This revolt was a reaction to new modernization laws from the Imperial government that, it was falsely rumored, would enslave the lower-classes of workers in Paraíba now that the [[History of slavery|slave trade]] was [[Eusébio de Queirós Law|prohibited]] in Brazil.<ref>{{cite web |title=Revolta do ronco da Abelha |url=https://www.infoescola.com/brasil-imperial/revolta-do-ronco-da-abelha/ |website=InfoEscola |access-date=2023-07-19 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20230719232238/https://www.infoescola.com/brasil-imperial/revolta-do-ronco-da-abelha/ |archive-date=2023-07-19 |language=pt-br}}</ref> Between the months of October and December 1874, Paraíba participated in the [[Quebra–Quilos revolt]], which was instigated by the replacement of the measurement system in Brazil with the [[metric system]]. The uprising was mostly concentrated in rural areas and was characterized by several acts of violence, at the same time as the so-called [[Religious Issue]] was gaining momentum. Paraíba also participated in the [[Paraguayan War]], with a force of three thousand men.<ref name="Mello_v8">{{cite book|last1=Mello|first1=José Octávio de Arruda|title=7 Centralismo e movimentos sociais de 1850 a 1880|publisher=A União|page=22|language=pt-br}}</ref>

In 1860, Paraíba had a population of about 212,000 people and suffered from several serious public health problems, including epidemics like [[cholera]] and [[yellow fever]]. One of the main causes of these issues was the lack of water in the largely [[semi-arid]] climate of the province. In 1877, Paraíba was hit by the worst [[drought]] in its history, accentuating poverty and prompting migration from the interior to the east.<ref name="Mello_v8"/>

=== Building a republic ===

In November 1889, after the fall of the monarchical regime in Brazil and the institution of a [[First Brazilian Republic|republic]], Paraíba became a federal state. Venâncio Neiva became the first president — equivalent to the modern-day role of governor — of the state. Neiva served from 1889 to 1891, when he was deposed. The next president was a member of the Social Nationaist Party (PSN), Floriano Peixoto. The PSN governed Paraíba until 1908, when the Conservative Republican Party (PRC) won the elections.<ref name="República_Paraíba">{{cite web|url=http://www.potyguar.com.br/index.php/estados-brasileiros/paraiba/a-republica-na-paraiba|title=A República na Paraíba|access-date=2013-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303171032/http://www.potyguar.com.br/index.php/estados-brasileiros/paraiba/a-republica-na-paraiba|archive-date=2016-03-03|language=pt-br}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reocities.com/paraiba1945/republica.htm|title=A República na Paraíba|access-date=2013-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180542/http://www.reocities.com/paraiba1945/republica.htm|archive-date=2016-03-03|language=pt-br}}</ref> The PRC then remained in power for an additional two decades, until the end of the Old Republic in 1930.
[[File:João Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque.jpg|thumb|180px|left|[[João Pessoa Cavalcanti de Albuquerque]], governor of Paraíba from 1928 to 1930, the year of his assassination]]
After the onset of the [[First World War]] (1914–1918), the economy of Paraíba entered a crisis, mainly due to the drop in exports of one of the main agricultural products of the state, [[cotton]].<ref name="República_Paraíba"/> In the April 1919 federal election, the Paraíban candidate [[Epitácio Pessoa]] won; at the time, he was leading the Brazilian delegation at the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920)|Paris Peace Conference]].

In 1928, [[João Pessoa (politician)|João Pessoa]] (the nephew of Epitácio Pessoa, the former president of Brazil) was elected as governor of Paraíba. Under his administration, cangaceiros in the interior of the state were persecuted and oligarchs were defied, generating discontent among the local landlords. This was especially the case with José Pereira Lima, a political leader of the municipality of [[Princesa Isabel]] and an ally of presidential candidate [[Júlio Prestes]]. With the invasion of the city of [[Teixeira, Paraíba|Teixeira]] by the Paraíban police and the imminent invasion of Lima's own Princesa Isabel, on February 28, 1930, he proclaimed the independent "[[Território de Princesa]]", which would only be subordinate directly to the federal government.<ref name="MEDEIROS, Mardson"/> The next day, the national election took place, with João Pessoa as the vice-presidential candidate for [[Getúlio Vargas]].

Initially, the nomenclature for this tourmaline was "Paraíba tourmaline". In 2006, the LMHC (Laboratory Manual Harmonization Committee) agreed that "Paraíba" should be simplified to "paraiba" and should refer to a variety of tourmaline instead of indicating a geographic origin.<ref>{{cite web |title=LMHC Information Sheet # 6 - Paraiba Tourmaline |url=https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bfbb7e6cc8fed3bb9293bf3/t/5bfe92a90e2e72555d61eec3/1543410345434/LMHC+Information+Sheet_6_V7_2012.pdf |website=LMHC Standardised Gemmological Report Wording |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230419114750/https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bfbb7e6cc8fed3bb9293bf3/t/5bfe92a90e2e72555d61eec3/1543410345434/LMHC+Information+Sheet_6_V7_2012.pdf |archive-date=2023-04-19}}</ref> The term "paraiba tourmaline" may now refer to gems found in Brazil, Nigeria, and Mozambique that contain copper and have the characteristic fluorescent blue-green color.

The stone has since become among the most sought-after gemstones on the market, yielding upwards of $50,000+ per carat.<ref>{{Cite web |title=PARAÍBA TOURMALINE AND COLOURED SAPPHIRE RING, MICHELE DELLA VALLE |url=https://www.christies.com/lot/lot-6138009|archive-url=https://archive.today/20231119114813/https://www.christies.com/lot/lot-6138009|archive-date=2023-11-19}}</ref> These tourmalines are often subject to heat-treatment and clarity enhancement to achieve a more desirable color. A lack of these treatments often increases the value of the stone.

The [[service sector]] is the largest component of [[GDP]] at 56.5%, followed by the [[industrial sector]] at 33.1%. [[Agriculture]] represents 10.4%, of [[GDP]] (2004). Paraíba exports: [[woven]] of [[cotton]] 36.3%, [[footwear]]es 20.1%, [[sugar]] and [[Alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] 10.8%, [[fish]] and [[crustacean]] 9.7%, [[sisal]] 7%, [[cotton]] 6.6% (2002).

Though historically sugarcane has dominated the Paraíba [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector, [[pineapple]], [[Maize|corn]], and [[beans]] cultivation are also widespread. The other important economical sector in the state is tourism, especially the state urban and unspoilt beaches, ecotourism and festivals such as "carnaval" and "São João."

==Infrastructure==

===International Airport===

[[File:Presidente Castro Pinto International Airport.jpg|thumb|right|[[Presidente Castro Pinto International Airport|Presidente Castro Pinto International Airport (JPA)]]]]
Located in the municipality of Bayeux, {{convert|8|km|spell=in|lk=on|abbr=out}} from downtown [[João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa]], [[Presidente Castro Pinto International Airport]] is currently undergoing expansion and remodeling work, which will raise the terminal's annual capacity to 860 thousand passengers.
The airport is well located in relation to obstacles because it covers an area roughly {{convert|65|m|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] and is sufficiently distant from urban areas or large real estate developments.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

The surrounding area is sparsely populated, with large open spaces. The existing developments are industrial with some small weekend country houses. There is no rough terrain or tall buildings nearby creating obstacles for takeoffs and landings.
The airport also is blessed with excellent climatic conditions for air operations. Moreover, within its approach radius there are no obstacles that can hinder or create risk for local air traffic. Named for a past president (former name for governors) of Paraíba, Castro Pinto, the airport operates round the clock.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

The current passenger terminal, built in an area of {{convert|8,947.72|m2|lk=on|2|abbr=off}}, has two levels, gardens and ample vehicle parking. It has all the expected amenities: arrival and departure lounges, a main concourse, check-in counters, baggage storage lockers, airline counters, snack bar/restaurant, [[tourist]] information booth, car rental agencies, [[Taxicab|taxi]] service and private parking.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===Highways===
[[File:BR-101, Pedras de Fogo (PB).jpg|thumb|right|BR-101 Highway in Paraíba]]
The BR-101 also the BR-230 are found in Paraíba . Several other roads also cross the state composing the complex net which is present all across the country.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

===National Airport===
Located in the interior of the state of Paraíba, in the city of [[Campina Grande]], João Suassuna Airport was remodeled in 2003, receiving a new terminal with capacity of 250 thousand passengers a year.

The old building was demolished and on the site a new facility was built holding nine shops, the main concourse, arrival and departure lounges, VIP lounge, bathrooms, mezzanine and a diaper-changing area.

The terminal area was increased to {{convert|2,500|m2|lk=out|abbr=off}}. The boarding area has {{convert|350|m2|abbr=off}} and the parking lot has spaces for 180 cars.

This expansion benefited the city both economically and from the standpoint of [[tourism]]. With the possibility for new flights, the air cargo movement will be able to grow, along with the number of tourists coming to attend the city's [[São João do Tigre|São João]] Festival.
A panel measuring {{convert|17|x|3.5|m|abbr=off}} in the front of the building carries a poem by the Paraíban writer Ariano Suassuna, in homage to his father, for whom the airport is named. Three more artworks are on permanent display in the passenger terminal.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

==Culture==

===Festa Junina (Saint John Festival)===
[[File:Marcelo_Calero_conhece_o_São_João_de_Campina_Grande_(27586988420).jpg|right|thumb|Saint John Festival in Campina Grande]]
[[Festa Junina]] was introduced to Northeastern [[Brazil]] by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] for whom St John's day (also celebrated as [[Midsummer]] Day in several [[Europe]]an countries), on the 24th of June, is one of the oldest celebrations of the year. Differently, of course, from what happens on the European [[Midsummer]] Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place during the [[summer solstice]] but during the [[winter solstice]]. The festivities traditionally begin after the 12th of June, on the eve of St Anthony's day, and last until the 29th, which is Saint Peter's day. During these fifteen days, there are [[bonfires]], [[fireworks]], and folk dancing in the streets (step names are in French, which shows the mutual influences between court life and peasant culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century Europe). Once exclusively a rural festival, today in Brazil, it is largely a city festival during which people joyfully and theatrically mimic peasant stereotypes and clichés in a spirit of jokes and good times. Typical refreshments and dishes are served. Like during Carnival, these festivities involve costume-wearing (in this case, peasant costumes), dancing, heavy drinking, and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing), such as what happens on [[Midsummer]] and St John's Day in Europe, and [[bonfires]] are a central part of these festivities in Brazil.

===Carnival===
The four-day period before Lent leading up to Ash Wednesday is [[carnival]] time in [[Brazil]]. Rich and poor alike forget their cares as they party in the streets.

==Flag==
The word ''nego'' on the state flag is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for "I deny" or "I refuse", referring to the events that led to the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930]].

Due to [[Milk Coffee Politics]] in Brazil, the [[president of Brazil|president]] of the country always alternated between someone from the state of [[Minas Gerais]] and someone from the state of [[São Paulo]]. In 1929, the incumbent president from São Paulo, [[Washington Luís]], was supposed to support a politician from Minas Gerais as the next president, but he instead decided to nominate someone from São Paulo for the second time in a row, [[Júlio Prestes]]. The state governor of Paraíba, [[João Pessoa Cavalcânti de Albuquerque]], refused to support the appointment of Júlio Prestes, and in 1930, Pessoa joined the alliance for the overthrow of the federal government. The revolution succeeded in toppling the Old Republic and installing [[Getúlio Vargas]]—who was from neither Minas Gerais nor São Paulo—as the president of Brazil, however, João Pessoa was assassinated; there is still debate as to whether the motive behind his murder was personal, political, or both. Following these events, the word ''nego'' was added to the flag of Paraíba.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-10-31 |title=Rebeldia da Paraíba está registrada na bandeira |url=https://super.abril.com.br/historia/rebeldia-da-paraiba-esta-registrada-na-bandeira/ |access-date=2022-11-01 |website=Superinteressante |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

According to the official government site of the state of Paraíba, the red color stands for the blood of João Pessoa after his assassination, while the black color represents mourning.

==Sports==
[[File:Botxtre.jpg|thumb|[[Almeidão]] stadium in [[João Pessoa, Paraíba|João Pessoa]].]]
In football, the main teams in the state are: [[Botafogo Futebol Clube (PB)|Botafogo]] from João Pessoa, [[Campinense Clube|Campinense]] and [[Treze Futebol Clube|Treze]], both from [[Campina Grande]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://soesporte.com.br/conquistas-dos-considerados-grandes-clubes-da-paraiba/|title = Conquistas dos considerados grandes clubes da Paraíba|date = 19 March 2013}}</ref>
