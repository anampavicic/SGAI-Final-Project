Cork was founded in the 6th century as a monastic settlement, and was expanded by [[Viking]] invaders around 915. Its charter was granted by [[John, King of England|Prince John]] in [[1185 in Ireland|1185]]. Cork city was once fully walled, and the remnants of the old medieval town centre can be found around South and North Main streets.

== History ==

{{Main|History of Cork}}

Cork was originally a monastic settlement, reputedly founded by [[Saint Finbarr]] in the 6th century.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ó Riain |first=Pádraig |title=Beatha Bharra (Saint Finbarr of Cork: the Complete Life) |publisher=Irish Texts Society |year=1994 |isbn=1-870166-57-4}}</ref> It became (more) urbanised some point between 915 and 922 when [[Norsemen|Norseman]] ([[Viking]]) settlers founded a trading port.<ref>{{cite book| last = Larsen | first = Anne-Christine | year = 2001 | title = The Vikings in Ireland | publisher = Viking Ship Museum | isbn = 9788785180421 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Moody |first1=T.W. |title=A New History of Ireland |last2=Martin |first2=F.X. |last3=Byrne |first3=F.J. |last4=Cosgrove |first4=A. |last5=Ó Cróinín |first5=D. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1976 |isbn=0-19-821737-4}}</ref> It has been proposed that, like Dublin, Cork was an important trading centre in the global Scandinavian trade network.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Aughey |first1=Arthur |title=Irish Civilization: An Introduction |last2=Oakland |first2=John |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |page=69}}</ref> The ecclesiastical settlement continued alongside the Viking {{lang|ga|longphort}}, with the two developing a type of symbiotic relationship; the Norsemen providing otherwise unobtainable trade goods for the monastery, and perhaps also military aid.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Michael A.

The city's charter was granted by [[King John of England|Prince John]], as [[Lord of Ireland]], in 1185.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Your Council " Charters |url=http://www.corkcity.ie/yourcouncil/charters/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214183402/http://corkcity.ie/yourcouncil/charters/ |archive-date=14 December 2010 |access-date=19 August 2012 |publisher=Cork City Council}}</ref> The city was once fully walled, and some wall sections and gates remain today.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cork City Council website – History – Walls of Cork |url=http://www.corkcity.ie/aboutcork/historyofcork/thewallsofcork/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923123434/http://corkcity.ie/aboutcork/historyofcork/thewallsofcork/ |archive-date=23 September 2010 |access-date=12 August 2010 |publisher=Corkcity.ie}}</ref> For much of the Middle Ages, Cork city was an outpost of [[Old English (Ireland)|Old English]] culture in the midst of a predominantly hostile [[Gaels|Gaelic]] countryside and cut off from the English government in [[the Pale]] around [[Dublin]]. Neighbouring Gaelic and [[Hiberno-Norman]] lords extorted "Black Rent" from the citizens to keep them from attacking the city. The present extent of the city has exceeded the medieval boundaries of the [[Barony of Cork City]]; it now takes in much of the neighbouring [[Barony of Cork]]. Together, these [[Barony (Ireland)|baronies]] are located between the [[Barony of Barrymore]] to the east, [[Muskerry East]] to the west and Kerrycurrihy to the south.
[[File:The Burning of Cork (9713428703).jpg|thumb|left|Workers clearing rubble on St Patrick's street following the [[Burning of Cork]].]]
The city's municipal government was dominated by about 12–15 merchant families, whose wealth came from overseas trade with continental Europe – in particular the export of wool and hides and the import of salt, iron and wine.

The medieval population of Cork was about 2,100 people. It suffered a severe blow in 1349 when almost half the townspeople died of plague when the [[Black Death]] arrived in the town. In 1491, Cork played a part in the English [[Wars of the Roses]] when [[Perkin Warbeck]], a pretender to the English throne, landed in the city and tried to recruit support for a plot to overthrow [[Henry VII of England]]. The then-mayor of Cork and several important citizens went with Warbeck to England but when the rebellion collapsed they were all captured and executed.

The title of [[Lord Mayor of Cork|Mayor of Cork]] was established by [[royal charter]] in 1318, and the title was changed to ''Lord Mayor'' in 1900 following the knighthood of the incumbent mayor by [[Queen Victoria]] on her visit to the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Charters issued to Cork city |url=http://www.corkcity.ie/yourcouncil/charters/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214183402/http://corkcity.ie/yourcouncil/charters/ |archive-date=14 December 2010 |access-date=19 October 2010 |publisher=Cork City Council}}</ref>

Since the nineteenth century, Cork had been a strongly [[Irish nationalist]] city, with widespread support for [[Third Home Rule Act|Irish Home Rule]], and the [[Irish Parliamentary Party]], but from 1910 stood firmly behind [[William O'Brien]]'s dissident [[All-for-Ireland League|All-for-Ireland Party]]. O'Brien published a third local newspaper, the ''[[Cork Free Press]]''. Cork was overtaken by [[Belfast]] as Ireland's second-largest city in the nineteenth century.

In the [[Irish War of Independence|War of Independence]], the centre of Cork was burnt down by the British [[Black and Tans]],<ref name="burning">{{Cite web |date=11 December 1920 |title=Cork City Library – History of Cork – The Burning of Cork |url=http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/history/historyofcorkcity/early20thcentury/theburningofcork/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200220035152/http://www.corkpastandpresent.ie/history/historyofcorkcity/early20thcentury/theburningofcork/ |archive-date=20 February 2020 |access-date=12 August 2010 |publisher=Corkpastandpresent.ie}}</ref> in an event known as the "[[The Burning of Cork|Burning of Cork]]"<ref name="burning" /> and saw fierce fighting between Irish guerrillas and UK forces. During the [[Irish Civil War]], Cork was for a time held by anti-[[Anglo-Irish Treaty|Treaty]] forces, until it was retaken by the pro-Treaty [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] in [[Irish Free State offensive#Fall of Cork and landing in the west|an attack from the sea]].

===Accent===
The Cork accent, part of the Southwest dialect of [[Hiberno-English]], displays various features which set it apart from other accents in Ireland. Patterns of tone and intonation often rise and fall, with the overall tone tending to be more high-pitched than other Irish accents. English spoken in Cork has several dialect words that are peculiar to the city and environs. Like standard [[Hiberno-English]], some of these words originate from the Irish language, but others through other languages Cork's inhabitants encountered at home and abroad.<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 February 2011 |title=Dialect Profile: The Cork Accent |url=http://dialectblog.com/2011/02/21/dialect-profile-the-cork-accent/ |access-date=26 March 2013 |publisher=Dialect Blog}}</ref> The Cork accent displays varying degrees of [[rhoticity in English|rhoticity]], usually indicative of the speaker's local community.

There are two cathedrals in the city; [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Cork|St. Mary's Cathedral]] and [[Saint Fin Barre's Cathedral]]. St Mary's Cathedral, often referred to as the North Cathedral, is the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the city and was begun in 1808. Its distinctive tower was added in the 1860s. St Fin Barre's Cathedral serves the [[Church of Ireland]] ([[Anglican]]) and is possibly the more famous of the two. It is built on the foundations of an earlier cathedral. Work began in 1862 and ended in 1879 under the direction of architect [[William Burges]].

[[St. Patrick's Street]], the main street of the city which was remodelled in the mid-2000s is known for the architecture of the buildings along its pedestrian-friendly route and is the main shopping thoroughfare. At its northern end is a landmark statue of [[Theobald Mathew (temperence reformer)|Father Mathew]].

Cork's most famous building is the [[Church of St Anne (Shandon)|church tower of St Anne]] in Shandon, which dominates the Northside of the city. It is widely regarded as the symbol of the city. The North and East sides are faced in red sandstone, and the West and South sides are clad in the predominant stone of the region, white limestone. At the top sits a weather vane in the form of an eleven-foot salmon.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Church of St. Anne Shandon |url=http://www.shandonbells.ie/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210207193430/https://www.shandonbells.ie/ |archive-date=7 February 2021 |access-date=12 August 2010 |publisher=Shandonbells.ie}}</ref> Another site in Shandon is [[Skiddy's Almshouse]], which was built in the 18th century to provide a home to the poorest of the city.

Under the [[Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898]], it was made a county borough, governed by a county borough corporation. This was altered by the [[Local Government Act 2001]], under each of the five county boroughs became designated as cities, governed by city councils. [[Cork City Council]] is a tier-1 entity of local government with the same status in law as a [[county council]].

While the local government in Ireland has limited powers in comparison with other countries, the council has responsibility for planning, roads, sanitation, libraries, street lighting, parks, and several other important functions. Cork City Council has 31 elected members representing six electoral areas. As of the [[2019 Cork City Council election]], the political representation is: [[Fianna Fáil]] (8 members), [[Fine Gael]] (7 members), [[Green Party (Ireland)|Green Party]] (4 members), [[Sinn Féin]] (4 members), [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour]] (1 member), [[People Before Profit–Solidarity]] (1 member), [[Workers' Party (Ireland)|Workers' Party]] (1 member), [[Independent politician (Ireland)|Independents]] (5 members).<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 June 2014 |title=Cork City Council Elected Members – Elected June 2014 |url=http://www.corkcity.ie/yourcouncil/electedmembers/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814032428/http://corkcity.ie/yourcouncil/electedmembers/ |archive-date=14 August 2015 |access-date=28 August 2015 |publisher=Cork City Council}}</ref> Certain councillors are co-opted to represent the city at the [[South-West Region, Ireland|South-West Regional Authority]].

===Road===

The city's road infrastructure improved in the late 20th and early 21st century, including the early 1980s construction of the Cork South Link [[dual carriageway]] which links the Kinsale Road roundabout with the city centre. Shortly after, the first sections of the South Ring dual carriageway were opened. Work continued extending the [[N25 road (Ireland)|N25]] South Ring Road through the 1990s, culminating in the opening of the Jack Lynch Tunnel under the [[River Lee (Ireland)|River Lee]]. The Kinsale Road flyover opened in August 2006 to remove a bottleneck for traffic heading to Cork Airport or Killarney. Other projects completed at this time include the [[N20 road|N20]] Blackpool bypass and the N20 Cork to Mallow road projects. The [[N22 road|N22]] Ballincollig dual carriageway bypass, which links to the Western end of the Cork Southern Ring road was opened in September 2004. City centre road improvements include the Patrick Street project – which reconstructed the street with a pedestrian focus. The [[M8 motorway (Ireland)|M8 motorway]] links Cork with [[Dublin]].

From 2012, cycle paths and bike stands were added in a number of areas.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cork City Cycling Strategy |url=http://www.corkcity.ie/services/roadstransportation/trafficdivision/cycling/filedownload,2419,en.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131032512/http://www.corkcity.ie/services/roadstransportation/trafficdivision/cycling/filedownload,2419,en.htm |archive-date=31 January 2014 |access-date=28 July 2013 |publisher=Cork City Council}}</ref> Subsequently, in 2014, a [[bicycle sharing system|public bicycle rental scheme]] was launched.

===Rail===

====Railway and tramway heritage====
Cork was one of the most rail-oriented cities in Ireland, featuring eight stations at various times. The main route, still much the same today, is from [[Dublin Heuston]]. Originally terminating on the city's outskirts at [[Blackpool, Cork|Blackpool]], the route now reaches the city centre [[terminal station|terminus]] of [[Cork Kent railway station|Kent Station]] via the Glanmire tunnel and [[Kilnap Viaduct]].<ref name="europeana">{{Cite web |title=Kilnap Viaduct |url=https://www.europeana.eu/resolve/record/15414/niah_search_jsp_type_record_county_CC_regno_20858005 |access-date=24 June 2015 |publisher=Europeana}}</ref> Now a through station, the line through Kent connects the towns of [[Cobh]] and [[Midleton]] east of the city. This also connected to the seaside town of [[Youghal]], until the 1980s.<ref>{{Cite web |date=19 May 2018 |title=Bring back the old Youghal railway |url=https://www.eveningecho.ie/corknews/Bring-back-the-old-Youghal-railway--5be7b33b-59f2-4758-98bf-861259c24f54-ds |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024192421/https://www.eveningecho.ie/corknews/Bring-back-the-old-Youghal-railway--5be7b33b-59f2-4758-98bf-861259c24f54-ds |archive-date=24 October 2018 |access-date=24 October 2018 |publisher=Evening Echo}}</ref>

[[File:Railway station in Cork NLI.jpg|thumb|left|Glanmire Road Station (now called Kent Station) c. the 1890s]]
Other rail routes terminating or traversing Cork city were the ''[[Cork, Blackrock and Passage Railway]]'', a line to [[Macroom]], the [[Cork and Muskerry Light Railway]] to [[Blarney]], [[Coachford]] and [[Donoughmore]], as well as the [[Cork, Bandon and South Coast Railway]] connecting [[Bantry]], [[Skibbereen]], [[Clonakilty]] and many other [[West Cork]] towns. West Cork trains terminated at Albert Quay, across the river from Kent Station (though an on-street rail system connected the two for rolling stock and cargo movement). There have been two tram networks in operation Within the city. A proposal to develop a horse-drawn tram (linking the city's railway termini) was made by American [[George Francis Train]] in the 1860s and implemented in 1872 by the Cork Tramway Company. However, the company ceased trading in 1875 after Cork Corporation refused permission to extend the line.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cork Tramway Company |url=http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/environment-geography/transport/cork-tram/index.xml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181024193055/http://www.askaboutireland.ie/reading-room/environment-geography/transport/cork-tram/index.xml |archive-date=24 October 2018 |access-date=24 October 2018 |publisher=askaboutireland.ie}}</ref>

In December 1898, the [[Cork Electric Tramways and Lighting Company]] began operating on the Blackpool–Douglas, Summerhill–Sunday's Well and [[Tivoli, Cork|Tivoli]]–Blackrock routes. Increased usage of cars and buses in the 1920s led to a reduction in the use of trams, which discontinued operations permanently on 30 September 1931.

The wider city area, including the city's suburbs, is served by three railway stations. These are [[Cork Kent railway station]], [[Little Island railway station]] and [[Glounthaune railway station]].

====Current routes====
Cork's [[Cork Kent railway station|Kent Station]] is the main railway station in the city. From here, [[Irish Rail]] services run to destinations all over Ireland. The main line from Cork to [[Dublin Heuston|Dublin]] has hourly departures on the half-hour from Cork, and is linked from [[Limerick Junction]] with connections to [[Clonmel railway station|Clonmel]] and [[Waterford railway station|Waterford]]. InterCity services are also available to [[Killarney railway station|Killarney]] and [[Tralee railway station|Tralee]], and to [[Limerick railway station|Limerick]], [[Ennis railway station|Ennis]], [[Athenry railway station|Athenry]] and [[Galway railway station|Galway]] (via [[Limerick Junction]] and the Limerick to Galway railway line).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Timetables |url=http://www.irishrail.ie/index.jsp?p=119&n=147 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825205834/http://www.irishrail.ie/index.jsp?p=119&n=147 |archive-date=25 August 2012 |access-date=28 August 2012 |website=Irish Rail}}</ref>
