'''Bioko Norte''' ({{IPA|es|ˈbjoko ˈnoɾte}}) is the second-most populated of the eight [[provinces of Equatorial Guinea]], after the [[Litoral]] province. Both the provincial capital, [[Rebola, Equatorial Guinea|Rebola]], and the national capital, [[Malabo]] are located here.  Heavily forested with little urban development, the southern central part includes part of the [[Parque Nacional del Pico Basilé]], a {{convert|330|km2}} national park which was established in 2000.
