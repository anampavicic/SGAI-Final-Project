===Early history===
[[File:Junagadh-ashok-shilalekh1.png|thumb|left|[[Ashoka's Major Rock Edict|Ashoka's Rock Edict]] at [[Girnar]], Junagadh]]

As per the legend, the founder of the Ror Dynasty Raja Dhaj, Ror Kumar, also known as [[Rai Diyach|Rai Dyach]], ruled over the principality of Jhunagarh in the fifth century BC.<ref>{{cite book| title=Mystic Melodies: Shah Abdul Latif Bhittai |author= MUSHTAQ ALI SHAH | publisher= Author House| place=Bloomington,IN,US| year=2014|isbn= 9781496996060 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpGQBQAAQBAJ&q=raja+dhaj%2CRor+Kumar%2C+alias+Rai+Dyach&pg=PA283}}</ref> An early structure, [[Uparkot Fort]], is located on a plateau in the middle of town. It was originally built in 319 BCE during the [[Mauryan dynasty]] by [[Chandragupta Maurya|Chandragupta]].{{cn|date=August 2022}} The fort remained in use until the 6th century, when it was abandoned for about 300 years, then rediscovered by the Chudasama ruler [[Graharipu]] in 976 CE.<ref name="RajanIndia1985">{{cite book|author1=K. V. Soundara Rajan|author2=Archaeological Survey of India|title=Junagadh|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bPNEAAAAIAAJ|access-date=30 June 2011|year=1985|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India}}</ref> The fort was subsequently besieged 16 times over a 1000-year period. One unsuccessful siege lasted twelve years.

Within {{convert|2|km}} of [[Uparkot Fort]] is an inscription with fourteen [[Edicts of Ashoka]] on a [[Ashoka's Major Rock Edict|large boulder]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=rs0ThKx9MHoC&q=junagadh M1  Ranchodji Amarji, ''Târikh-i-Soraṭh: A History of the Provinces of Soraṭh and Hâlâr in Kâthiâwâd,'' pp. 36–46, Trubner & Co. (1882) – translation of the edicts.]</ref> The inscriptions are in [[Brāhmī script|Brahmi]] script in a language similar to [[Pali]] and date from 250 BCE. On the same rock there is a later inscription in [[Sanskrit]], which was added around 150 CE by Mahakshatrap [[Rudradaman I]], the [[Saka]] ([[Scythian]]) ruler of [[Malwa]], and a member of the [[Western Kshatrapas]] dynasty,<ref>[http://projectsouthasia.sdstate.edu/Docs/HISTORY/PRIMARYDOCS/EPIGRAPHY/JunagadhRockInscription.htm   "Junagadh Rock Inscription of Rudradaman", ''Project South Asia''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223182107/http://projectsouthasia.sdstate.edu/Docs/HISTORY/PRIMARYDOCS/EPIGRAPHY/JunagadhRockInscription.htm |date=23 February 2009 }}</ref> and which has been described as "the earliest known Sanskrit inscription of any extent".<ref>|Meaning, that is not very short.

Kosambi in [[John Keay|Keay, John]], ''India, a History'', p. 132, 2000, HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0002557177}}</ref> Another inscription dates from about 450 CE and refers to [[Skandagupta]], the last Gupta emperor. Old rock-cut [[Buddhist]] caves in this area, dating from well before 500 CE, have stone carvings and floral work. There are also the Khapra Kodia Caves north of the fort, and the [[Bava Pyara Caves]] south of the fort. The Bava Pyara caves contain artworks of both [[Buddhism]] and [[Jainism]].

The [[Maitraka]] dynasty ruled Gujarat from 475 to 767 CE. The founder of the dynasty, General Bhatarka, military governor of Saurashtra peninsula under the [[Gupta empire]], established himself as the independent ruler of Gujarat around the last quarter of the 5th century.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ગિરનાર ઇતિહાસ {{!}} Rahasya|url=https://rahasya.onlinestauts.com/ગિરનાર-ઇતિહાસ/|access-date=2021-03-20|language=en-US}}</ref>

===Chudasama dynasty===
{{Main|Chudasama dynasty}}

The early history of the Chudasama dynasty – which ruled [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] from Junagadh – is almost lost. The bardic legends differ very much in the names, order, and numbers of early rulers, so they are not considered reliable. According to tradition, the dynasty is said to have been founded in the late 9th century by [[Chudachandra]]. Subsequent rulers such as [[Graharipu]], [[Navaghana (late 11th century king)|Navaghana]], and [[Khengara (12th century king)|Khengara]], were in conflict with the [[Chaulukya]] rulers [[Mularaja]] and [[Jayasimha Siddharaja]]; and Saurashtra was briefly governed by Chaulukya governors during this period. These events are recorded in contemporary and later Jain chronicles.

In 1350, Junagadh was conquered by [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] with the help and forces of [[Koli people|Koli]] chieftain Jesaji (Jesing) from Ra Khengar.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Williams |first1=Raymond Brady |last2=Trivedi |first2=Yogi |title=Swaminarayan Hinduism: Tradition, Adaptation, and Identity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rs5JDwAAQBAJ&dq=Junagadh+Kolis&pg=PT93 |date=2016 |location=New Delhi, India |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-908959-8 |language=en |access-date=14 April 2023 |quote=The most famous leader of the Khant Kolis was Jesa or Jesing, who helped Muhammad bin Tughluq capture Junagadh (1350) from Ra Khengar. In return for this, the sultan is said to have bestowed on the Khants the hill of Girnar and the twenty-four villages of Bilkha chovisi.}}</ref>

After the end of the rule of the Chaulukyas and their successors, the [[Vaghela dynasty]], in Gujarat, the Chudasamas ruled independently, or as vassals of successor states, the [[Gujarat under Delhi Sultanate|Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Gujarat Sultanate]]. [[Mandalika I]] was the first Chudasama ruler known from inscriptions, and during his reign, Gujarat was invaded by the [[Khalji dynasty]] of Delhi. The last king of the dynasty, [[Mandalika III]], was defeated and forcibly converted to Islam in 1472 by Gujarat Sultan [[Mahmud Begada]], who annexed the state.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Cambridge Shorter History of India |chapter=Gujarat, Malwa and Khandesh |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |year=1934 |pages=307–308 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.283073 |access-date=21 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Studies in Indian History: Rajasthan Through The Ages: Marwar and British Administration |editor1-first=R.

The [[Uparkot Fort]] of Junagadh was occupied by the Chudasamas during the reign of [[Graharipu]]. It is said to have been later rebuilt by [[Navaghana (late 11th century king)|Navaghana]], who had transferred his capital from Vamanasthali to Junagadh. He is also credited with construction of the [[stepwell]]s [[Navghan Kuvo]] and [[Adi Kadi Vav]] in the fort. His descendant [[Khengara (12th century king)|Khengara]] is attributed with building a stepwell, [[Ra Khengar Vav]], on the way to Vanthali from Junagadh.<ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=P7EHTBl_pyQC| title = Gujarat–Daman–Diu: A Travel Guide| last = Ward| date = 1 January 1998| publisher = Orient Longman Limited| isbn = 9788125013839| language = en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=gfaxCQAAQBAJ| title = The Heat and Dust Project: The Broke Couple's Guide to Bharat| last1 = Jha| first1 = Saurav| last2 = Roy| first2 = Devapriya| date = 15 May 2015| publisher = HarperCollins India| isbn = 9789351367505| language = ar}}</ref>

===Gujarat sultanate===
{{Main|Gujarat Sultanate}}
[[File:Bazaar in Junagadh.jpg|thumb|right|Photograph of a bazaar at Junagadh in Gujarat, taken by F. Nelson in the 1890s.]]
[[Mahmud Begada|Sultan Mahmud Begada]] changed the name of Junagadh to Mustafabad and built the fortifications around the town and the mosque in Uparkot Fort.

Under the [[Gujarat Sultanate]], Junagadh was governed by an official, styled ''[[wikt:thanadar|thanadar]]'' (commander), appointed directly by Ahmedabad. This official collected the tribute and revenue of the crown domain. The first ''thanadar'' was Tatar Khan, an adopted son of the Sultan and after him Mirza Khalil, the eldest son of the Sultan who afterwards succeeded him under the title of Sultan Muzaffar. Prince Khalil during his tenure of office founded the village called Khalilpur. The Sultan also installed Bhupatsingh, the son of the last Chudasama king, Mandalika III, in Junagadh as a ''[[jagir]]dar'' (feudal lord). The ''jagir'' allotted to Bhupatsingh was the Sil Bagasra Chovisi; and his descendants were known as [[Raizada]]. They continued to rule there. Bhupatsingh was succeeded by his son Khengar.<ref name="GBP1884"/>

After the accession of Sultan Muzafar, and indeed during the latter part of Sultan Mahmud's reign, the seat of government was moved from Junagadh to Diu owing to the importance of that island as a naval station and to check the ravages of the Portuguese. Tatarkhan Ghori was left at Junagadh by Malik Eiaz who himself resided at Diu. After the disgrace and death of Malik Eiaz, Tatarkhan Ghori became independent at Junagadh; and after the death of Sultan Bahadur, the Ghori family reigned independently at Junagadh, though still owing a nominal allegiance to the successive Sultans at Ahmadabad. This state of affairs continued until the first conquest of Gujarat by the Mughal emperor [[Akbar]], when Aminkhan Ghori had succeeded his father Tatarkhan at Junagadh.<ref name="GBP1884"/>

When the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]] took over the ports of [[Diu, India|Diu]] and [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]] in the 16th century, a fifteen-foot cannon, made in Egypt in 1531, was abandoned by a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] admiral opposing the Portuguese forces at Diu, which is now at Uparkot Fort.

===Under the Mughal Empire===
;Ghori rule
In 1525, Khengar was succeeded by his son Noghan. Tatarkhan Ghori had now become almost independent. In his time Jam Raval conquered Halar and built Navanagar. In 1551, Noghan was succeeded by his son Shrisingh, who lived till 1586. During this time, Tatarkhan Ghori died and was succeeded by his son Aminkhan Ghori. In his time, Akbar conquered Gujarat, although Sorath remained independent under the Ghori rule. The exact date of Tatarkhan Ghori's death is not known; but from the mention of Aminkhan as his successor, it must have been from about 1570 to 1575. On the return of [[Akbar|Emperor Akbar]] to Agra in 1573, after the defeat and death of Muhammad Husain Mirzah and Ikhtiyar ul Mulk, he gave orders that Sorath should be conquered from Aminkhan Ghori. Vazir Khan attempted it but was unequal to the task. Great confusion existed now in Sorath. The Moghal conquest of Gujarat, the collapse of the power of the Gujarat Sultans, the encroachments of the Jam, and the assumption of independence by the Ghori all augmented the confusion afterwards increased by the escape of Sultan Muzaffar in 1583 and subsequent partisan warfare.<ref name="GBP1884"/>

During these disturbances Amin Khan Ghori and his son Daulat Khan Ghori espoused the cause of Muzafar, as did the Jam and Loma Khuman of Kherdi. The exact date of Amin Khan Ghori's death is not known but it was about 1589–90. Raizada Khengar also warmly espoused Mnzafar's side. After the siege and capture of Junagadh in 1591–92 by Naurang Khan, Syad Kasim, and Gnjar Khan; Khengar was dismissed to his estate of Sil Bagasra, and the Raizada ceased to rule at Junagadh. Daulat Khan Ghori died of his wounds during the siege, and henceforth Junagadh became the seat of the imperial ''[[faujdar]]''s (garrison commanders) of Sorath in subordination to the imperial viceroy at Ahmedabad.<ref name="GBP1884"/>

;Imperial rule
The first ''faujdar'' of Junagad was Naurang Khan and, next, Syad Kasim. The most famous were (1) Mirzah Isa Tarkhan (2) Kutb ud din Kheshgi, and (3) Sardarkhan. Of these Mirzah Isa Tarkhan ruled Sorath from about 1633–34 to 1642, when he was appointed viceroy of Gujarat. On this occasion he left his son Inayat Ullah as ''faujdar'' at Junagadh while he himself conducted the government of Gujarat from its capital, Ahmedabad. In Mirzah Isa Tarkhan's time the fortifications of Junagadh were entirely repaired. Kutb ud din was another ''faujdar'', and his tenure of office lasted from about 1653 to 1666. In about 1664, he conquered Navanagar and annexed it to the imperial domain. Sardarkhan also distinguished himself as ''faujdar'' of Sorath, both by the firmness of his rule and by his construction (1681, AH 1092) of the ''Sardar Baug'' (palace) and excavation of the ''Sardar Talav'' (main gate). He built a mausoleum for himself in the Sardar Baug, but he died at [[Thatta]], in Sindh, and is said to have been buried there and not at Junagadh. He was ''faujdar'' from about 1666 to 1686, but in 1670 he went for a short time to [[Idar, Gujarat|Idar]] and was replaced by Syad Dilerkhan. The last of the ''faujdar''&thinsp;s was Sherkhan Babi, who became independent and assumed the title of Nawab Bahadur Khan.<ref name="GBP1884">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c70MAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA711|title=Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency : Kathiawar|publisher=Government Central Press|year=1884|editor=Watson|editor-first=James W.|volume=VIII|location=Bombay|pages=489–502}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>

In 1730, Mohammad Sher Khan Babi, who owed allegiance to the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] governor of [[Gujarat Subah]], founded the state of Junagadh by declaring independence after the invasion by the Maratha [[Gaekwad dynasty]]. Babi founded the [[Babi Dynasty]] of Junagadh State. His descendants, the Babi Nawabs of Junagadh—who were Babi or [[Babai (Pashtun tribe)|Babai]] [[pashtuns]] from [[Afghanistan]]—conquered large territories in southern [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] and ruled for the next two centuries, first as tributaries of [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], and later under the [[suzerainty]] of the British, who granted the honor of a 13-[[gun salute]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/j/junagadh.html |title=Junagadh Princely State (13 gun salute) |access-date=24 April 2015 |archive-date=20 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170520212059/http://members.iinet.net.au/~royalty/ips/j/junagadh.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====British period====
[[File:Drapeau Junagadh vector.svg|right|thumb|Flag of Junagadh, during the British period.]]

In 1807, Junagadh State became a [[British India|British protectorate]]. The [[East India Company]] took control of the state by 1818, but the Saurashtra area was never directly administered by the British,{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} who instead divided the territory into more than one hundred [[princely state]]s, which remained in existence until 1947.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} The present old-town, developed during the 19th and 20th centuries, constituted one of those princely states.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The [[Shri Swaminarayan Mandir, Junagadh|Shri Swaminarayan Mandir]] temple in Junagadh was constructed on land presented by Jinabhai (Hemantsingh) Darbar of Panchala, and dedicated on 1 May 1828. [[Swaminarayan]] appointed [[Gunatitanand Swami]] as the first [[mahant]] (religious and administrative head of a temple), who served in this role and preached there for over 40 years.<ref name="Williams 2001 38">{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Raymond|title=An Introduction To Swaminarayan Hinduism|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontosw0000will|url-access=registration|year=2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=0-521-65422-X|pages=[https://archive.org/details/introductiontosw0000will/page/38 38]}}</ref><ref name="Ishwarcharandas 2007 94">{{cite book|last=Ishwarcharandas|first=Sadhu|title=Aksharbrahma Gunatitanand Swami|year=2007|publisher=Swaminarayan Aksharpith|location=Ahmedabad|isbn=978-81-7526-302-4|pages=94}}</ref>

====Accession by India====
{{Main|Annexation of Junagadh}}

During the period just before the independence and [[partition of India|partition of India and Pakistan]] in 1947, the 562 [[princely state]]s that had existed outside [[British India]], but under British [[suzerainty]], were given the choice of acceding to either India or Pakistan, or to remaining apart. Although the states were theoretically free to choose, [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Earl Mountbatten]] stated that "geographic compulsions" meant that most of them would choose India. Mountbatten took the position that only states that shared a common border with Pakistan should choose to accede to it, but he had no power to impose this point of view on the states.

On 15 September 1947, Nawab [[Muhammad Mahabat Khanji III|Mohammad Mahabat Khanji III]] of Junagadh&nbsp;– which, although located at the south-western end of [[Gujarat]], had no common border with Pakistan&nbsp;– chose to accede to Pakistan, ignoring Mountbatten's views and arguing that Junagadh could access Pakistan by sea. The rulers of two states that were subject to the suzerainty of Junagadh&nbsp;— [[Mangrol, Kathiawar|Mangrol]] and [[Babariawad]]&nbsp;— reacted by declaring their independence from Junagadh and acceding to India. In response, the nawab's forces militarily occupied the two states. Rulers of other neighbouring states reacted angrily, sent troops to the Junagadh frontier, and appealed to the government of India for assistance. A group of Junagadhis, led by [[Samaldas Gandhi]], formed a government-in-exile, the ''Aarzi Hukumat'' ("temporary government").<ref>{{Citation |last=Lumby |first=E.W.R. |title=The Transfer of Power in India, 1945–1947 |publisher=George Allen and Unwin |place=London |year=1954 |pages=237–238}}</ref>

India asserted that Junagadh was not contiguous to Pakistan and, believing that if Junagadh was permitted to accede to Pakistan communal tension already simmering in Gujarat would worsen, refused to accept the nawab's accession to Pakistan. The Indian government pointed out that the state was 96% Hindu, and called for a plebiscite to decide the question of accession. India [[blockade|cut off]] supplies of fuel and coal to Junagadh, severed air and postal links, sent troops to the frontier, and occupied the [[principality|principalities]] of Mangrol and Babariawad, which had acceded to India.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lumby|1954|p=238}}</ref>

Pakistan agreed to discuss a plebiscite, subject to the withdrawal of Indian troops, a condition India rejected. On 26 October, the nawab and his family fled to Pakistan following clashes between Junagadhi and Indian troops.

On 7 November, Junagadh's court, facing collapse, invited the government of India to take over the state's administration. The Dewan of Junagadh, Sir [[Shah Nawaz Bhutto]], the father of [[Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto]], decided to invite the [[Government of India]] to intervene and wrote a letter to Mr. Buch, the regional commissioner of [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] in the government of India to this effect.<ref>{{cite web
