'''Zhuji''' ({{zh|t=諸暨|s=诸暨|p=Zhūjì}}) is a [[county-level city]] under the administration of the [[prefecture-level city]] of [[Shaoxing]], in north-central [[Zhejiang]] province, China, located about {{Convert|40|mi|km|abbr=}} south of [[Hangzhou]]. It has {{convert|2311|km2|abbr=on}} with a population of 1,218,072 inhabitants at the 2020 census even though the built-up (''or metro'') area is much smaller.<ref name="auto"/>

The region around Zhuji has been settled since [[Neolithic]] times and was the origin of the [[Baiyue|Wuyue culture]].<ref>{{cite book|title=China Archaeology & Art Digest|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M0zrAAAAMAAJ|year=1999|publisher=Art Text (HK) Pty Limited|page=178}}</ref> During the [[Spring and Autumn period]], it was the birthplace of the legendary beauty [[Xi Shi]].<ref name="Lee">{{cite book|author=Lee|title=Biographical Dictionary of Chinese Women: Antiquity Through Sui, 1600 B.C.E.-618 C.E.|year=2007|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u7mLql4TAxoC&pg=PA85|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-4182-3|page=85}}</ref> After the [[Yue (state)|state of Yue]] was absorbed into the unification of China, [[Qin Shi Huang]] formally codified the boundaries of Zhuji as a [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|county]] in 222 BC. This status remained intact until 1989, when the State Council reclassified Zhuji as a city.

==Economy==
Zhuji is located in the Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone. Although there is not much arable land per capita, relying on the rich water resources of the Puyang River, it has developed agriculture well since ancient time. During the period of the Republic of China, many people in Zhuji, like other Zhejiang people in the surrounding areas, left their hometowns to develop in Shanghai, and operated small workshops, small factories, and textile and nanny jobs. After the reform and opening up, we vigorously developed townships, home-based industries, and made considerable achievements in textile and hardware manufacturing. At the same time, the two natural and cultural hotspots of Xi Shi and Wu Xie are used to develop the tourism industry.
Its modern civic strengths include an excellent educational system and robust economic development, especially in the production of [[pearls]], [[socks]] and embroidery machinery  [[Datang, Zhuji|Datang]].<ref name="Bloom2011">{{cite book|last=Bloom|first=Stephen G.|title=Tears of Mermaids: The Secret Story of Pearls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LeAmW3bY7zUC&pg=PA109|date=10 May 2011|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-1-4299-2363-7|page=109}}</ref> Due to its pearl production, the city has become known as "The Pearl City".
Apart from Pearl, it also has many other local specialties:
The textile industry is well developed. It has the largest hosiery industry in the country.
Small hardware industry. Spring, small and medium-sized bearings.
Rich in freshwater pearls, it has the largest pearl trading market in China and is known as the hometown of pearls.
Citron is also a local specialty tea.
