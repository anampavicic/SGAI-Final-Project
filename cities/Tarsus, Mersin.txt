It is part of the Adana-Mersin metropolitan area, the fourth-largest [[metropolitan area]] in Turkey. Tarsus forms an administrative district in the eastern part of [[Mersin Province]] and lies at the heart of the {{lang|tr|[[√áukurova]]|italic=no}} region.

With a history going back over 6,000 years, Tarsus has long been an important stop for traders and a focal point of many civilisations. During the [[Roman Empire]], it was the capital of the province of [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Cilicia]]. It was the scene of the first meeting between [[Mark Antony]] and [[Cleopatra]], and the birthplace of [[Paul the Apostle]].

Tarsus was served by Adana [[Adana ≈ûakirpa≈üa Airport|≈ûakirpa≈üa Airport]], replaced in August 2024 by [[√áukurova International Airport]]; and is connected by [[Turkish State Railways]] to both [[Adana]] and [[Mersin]].

== Etymology ==
The ancient name '''Tarsos''' is derived from {{lang|hit-Latn|Tarsa}}, the original name given to the city by the [[Hittites]], who were among the earliest settlers of the region. That in turn was possibly derived from the name of the storm god [[Tar·∏´unz]].<ref>[http://www.sirkeli-project.info/en/research_sitename.html Sirkeli Archaeological Project] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105174643/http://www.sirkeli-project.info/en/research_sitename.html|date=2009-01-05}}</ref> During the Hellenistic era Tarsus was known as ''Antiochia on the Cydnus'' ({{langx|el|ŒëŒΩœÑŒπœåœáŒµŒπŒ± œÑŒøœÖ ŒöœçŒ¥ŒΩŒøœÖ}}, {{langx|la|Antiochia ad Cydnum}}), to distinguish it from [[Syrian Antioch]]. The Romans knew it as {{lang|grc-Latn|Juliopolis}}, while it was {{lang|hyw-Latn|Darson}} in [[Western Armenian]] and {{lang|hy-Latn|Tarson}} in [[Eastern Armenian]].

According to the [[Suda]], the city was founded by [[Perseus]] after he fought the [[Isaurians]] and the [[Cilicians]]. An oracle told him to found a city in the place where the flat (œÑŒ±œÅœÉœåœÇ) of his foot would touch the earth while he was dismounting from his horse after the victory.<ref>[http://www.poesialatina.it/_ns/greek/testi/Suda/Lexicon.html Suda, mu, 406]</ref>[[File:Tarsus, Cilicia, Turkey (37581512826).jpg|thumb|St. Paul's Well in Tarsus, [[Cilicia]]]]

==Geography==

Located on the mouth of the [[Berdan River]] ([[Cydnus]] in antiquity), which empties into the Mediterranean, Tarsus sits at a junction where land and sea routes connecting the [[Cilicia]]n plain (today called [[√áukurova]]), central [[Anatolia]] and the Mediterranean Sea meet. The climate is typical of the Mediterranean region, with very hot, humid summers and chilly, damp winters.

Tarsus has a long history of commerce, and is still a commercial centre today, trading in the produce of the fertile √áukurova plain. Tarsus is also a thriving industrial centre for refining and processing for export. Industries include agricultural machinery, spare parts, textiles, fruit-processing, brick-making and ceramics.

Agriculture is an important source of income with half the local land area farmland ({{cvt|1,050|km2|disp=sqbr}}) and most of the remainder forest or orchard. The farmland is mostly well-irrigated, fertilised and managed with up-to-date equipment.

==History==
[[File:AncientRoadTarsus.JPG|left|thumb|Roman road in Tarsus]]
===Foundation and prehistory===
Excavation of the mound of [[G√∂zl√ºkule]] revealed that the prehistoric development of Tarsus reached back to the [[Neolithic Period]] and continued unbroken through [[Chalcolithic|the Chalcolithic]] and [[Early Bronze Age]]s.

The settlement stood at the crossing of several important trade routes linking [[Anatolia]] to [[Syria]] and beyond. Because most of the ruins lie under the modern city, archaeology has barely touched the ancient city. As an important port in a merchant marine trade network spanning the eastern Mediterranean and beyond from before the third millennium, the city was always an important centre for cultural interchange with traces of its influence visible from pre-Homeric Greek evidence onwards. The city may have been of [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] or [[Semitic people|Semitic]] origin; it is first mentioned as '''Tarsisi''' in [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian]] records of the campaigns of [[Esarhaddon]], as well as several times in the records of [[Shalmaneser I]] and [[Sennacherib]], the latter having had the city rebuilt. A Greek legend connects it with the memory of the Assyrian king [[Ashurbanipal|Sardanapalus]] (Ashurbanipal), still preserved in the [[Donukta≈ü|Dunuk-Tach]], called 'tomb of Sardanapalus', a monument of unknown origin. During the Hellenistic era it was a centre for exchange between Neo-Platonic, Gnostic and Mystery traditions.

[[Stephanus of Byzantium]] quotes [[Athenodorus of Tarsus]] on another legend:

{{bquote|Anchiale, daughter of [[Iapetus (mythology)|Iapetus]], founded Anchiale (a city near Tarsus): her son was [[Cydnus]], who gave his name to the river at Tarsus: the son of Cydnus was Parthenius, from whom the city was called Parthenia: afterwards the name was changed to Tarsus.}}

Much of this legendary account of the foundation of Tarsus, however, appeared in the Roman era, and it is not reliable. The geographer [[Strabo]] states that Tarsus was founded by people from [[Ancient Argos|Argos]] who were exploring this coast. Another legend claims that [[Bellerophon]] fell off his winged horse [[Pegasus]] here, hurting his foot in the process, and that the city was named ''tar-sos'' (''the sole of the foot'') in memory of his accident. Other candidates for legendary founder of the city include the hero [[Perseus]] and [[Triptolemus]], son of the earth-goddess [[Demeter]], doubtless because the countryside around Tarsus is such good farmland. Later the coins of Tarsus bore the image of [[Hercules]] due to another tale in which the hero was held prisoner here by the local god [[Sandon (god)|Sandon]]. Tarsus has been suggested as a possible site for the biblical [[Tarshish]], to which the prophet [[Jonah]] wanted to flee, but [[Tartessos]] in Spain has also been offered as a possible location for this. (See further<ref>Jonah 1:3 and the entry for Jonah in the [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=389&letter=J&search=jonah Jewish Encyclopedia]</ref>)

=== Early antiquity ===
{{see also|Cilicia (satrapy)}}
In historical times, the city was first ruled by the [[Hittites]], followed by [[Assyria]], and then by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]]. As the principal town of [[Cilicia]], Tarsus was the seat of a Persian [[satrap]]y from 400 BC onward. Indeed, [[Xenophon]] records that in 401 BC, when [[Cyrus the Younger]] marched against [[Babylon]], the city was governed by King [[Syennesis (5th century)|Syennesis]] in the name of the Persian monarch.

At this period the god of the city was Sandon, of whom a large monument existed at Tarsus at least until the 3rd century AD. Coins showed Sandon standing on a winged and horned lion, and it is now thought likely that the [[Lion of Saint Mark]] on the pillar in the [[Piazza San Marco]] in [[Venice]] was in origin a winged lion-griffin copied from such a monument in Tarsus.<ref>See The Lion of Venice: edited by Bianca Maria Scarfi (Venice. 1990) pp.101 & 110</ref>

[[Alexander the Great]] passed through with his army in 333 BC and nearly met his death here after bathing in the Cydnus. By this time Tarsus was already largely influenced by [[Culture of Greece|Greek language and culture]], and as part of the [[Seleucid Empire]] it became more and more [[Hellenization|Hellenised]]. Strabo praised the cultural level of Tarsus in this period with its philosophers, poets and linguists. The schools of Tarsus rivalled those of [[Athens]] and [[Alexandria]]. A reference in the Bible ([[2 Maccabees]] (4:30)) records the city's revolt against [[Antiochus IV Epiphanes|Antiochus IV Epiphanes in about 171 BC .]]The king had renamed the town '''Antiochia on the Cydnus''' although the name did not stick due because too many cities were named Antioch. At this time the library of Tarsus held 200,000 books, including a huge collection of scientific works.

=== Roman period ===

After crushing the feared [[Cilician pirates]], [[Pompey]] brought Tarsus under [[Roman Republic|Roman]] rule In 67 BC, and it became the capital of the [[Cilicia (Roman province)|Roman province of Cilicia]].<ref name="CEB269">{{cite journal| first = C.

[[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius Longinus]] planned to kill him here as early as 47 BC, and [[Cleopatra]] and [[Mark Antony]] met and was the scene of the celebrated feasts they gave during the construction of their fleet (41 BC). In [[William Shakespeare]]'s 1606 play ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' (Act 5, Scene 2) Cleopatra says she is going to Cydnus to meet Antony after his death, (i.e. she will commit suicide to meet him in the afterlife). "Go fetch / My best attires: I am again for Cydnus, / To meet Mark Antony."
[[File:Cleopatra Gate in Tarsus.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Cleopatra's Gate]] in Tarsus]]

In the Roman period, the city was an important intellectual centre, boasting its own academy. One of its leading lights, the philosopher [[Athenodorus Cananites]], was the tutor of the first Roman emperor, [[Augustus]], a fact which secured continuous imperial patronage for the city.<ref name="CEB269"/>

When the province of Cilicia was divided, Tarsus remained the civil and religious metropolis of Cilicia Prima, a grand city with palaces, marketplaces, roads and bridges, baths, fountains and waterworks, a gymnasium on the banks of the [[Cydnus]], and a stadium. Tarsus was later eclipsed by nearby [[Adana]] but remained important as a port and shipyard. Several Roman emperors were interred here: [[Marcus Claudius Tacitus]], [[Maximinus II]] and [[Julian the Apostate]], who planned to move his capital here from Antioch if he returned from his Persian expedition.<ref>[[Roger Collins]], ''Early Medieval Europe 300-1000'' ([[Basingstoke]], Hampshire: [[Palgrave Macmillan]], 1999) p. 40.,</ref>

Tarsus was the city where, according to the [[Acts of the Apostles]], Saul of Tarsus<ref>{{bibleverse|Acts|9:11|9}}</ref> was born, although he was brought up in Jerusalem.<ref>"I am verily a man which am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and taught according to the perfect manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day." -- {{bibleref|Acts|22:3|9}}</ref> He was a Roman citizen ([[Acts 21#Verse 39|Acts 21:39]]; Acts 22:25‚Äì29) "of Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city".<ref>{{bibleverse|Acts|21:39|KJV}}: [[King James Version]]</ref> Saul, who eventually became [[Paul the Apostle]] after his professed encounter with Jesus ({{bibleverse|Acts|9:11,21:39,22:3|multi=yes}}), returned here after his conversion ({{bibleref|Acts|9:30|9}}). About eight years later, [[Barnabas]] retrieved him from Tarsus to help with the work of preaching and teaching in [[Early centers of Christianity#Antioch|Syrian Antioch]] ({{bibleref|Acts|11:25|9}}).

By then, a [[Christians|Christian]] community probably already existed although the first recorded bishop, [[Helenus of Tarsus|Helenus]], dates only from the 3rd century. Owing to the importance of Tarsus, many martyrs were put to death there, including [[Saint Pelagia of Tarsus]], [[Saint Boniface of Tarsus]], [[Saint Marinus of Tarsus]], [[Saint Diomedes]], [[Saint Quiricus and Saint Julitta]].

The city remained largely pagan, however, until the time of [[Julian the Apostate]] (r. 361‚Äì363), who reportedly planned to make it his capital.<ref name="edwards">{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=Robert W.|chapter=Tarsus|title=The Eerdmans Encyclopedia of Early Christian Art and Archaeology, ed., Paul Corby Finney |date=2016 |publisher=William B.

A cave near Tarsus is one of several places said to be the location of the legend of the [[Seven Sleepers]], common to Christianity and Islam.

===Middle Ages===

Following the [[Muslim conquest of the Levant]] in the 630s, the city came into contact with the forces of the [[Rashidun]] Caliphate. It is unclear when the town was first captured by the Arabs, but it is clear that it, and the wider region of Cilicia, remained contested between the Byzantines and the new Caliphate for several decades, up to the early 8th century. According to Muslim sources, as he was retreating the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]] ({{reign|610|641}}) deliberately withdrew the population and devastated the region between Antioch and Tarsus, creating a [[no man's land]] between the two empires.<ref name="auto">{{cite journal| first = C.

It was not until the early [[Abbasid dynasty|Abbasid]] period that Tarsus, by then lying in ruins, was reoccupied and refortified, this time as an advance strongpoint within the fortified zone of the ''[[al- øAwƒÅ·π£im]]'', stretching from Tarsus northeast to [[Malatya]], and as an assembly point for expeditions against the Byzantine Empire.<ref name="EI2">{{EI2 | title = ·π¨ars≈´s | first = C.

Three thousand [[Greater Khorasan|Khurasanis]] and 2,000 Syrians (a thousand each from [[Antioch]] and [[al-Massisa]]) were given houses and land in the new fortress city.<ref>{{cite journal| first = C.

Henceforth and until the Byzantine reconquest in the 10th century, Tarsus was one of the main centres for the holy war (''[[jihad|jihƒÅd]]'')  against Byzantium, comprising annual raids (''·π£awƒÅ øif'') into Byzantine lands through the [[Cilician Gates]] when the mountain snows had melted and passage was possible. These raids were mounted by the local garrisons, maintained by the taxation not only of the frontier zone of the ''al- øAwƒÅ·π£im'' but also by generous subsidies from the caliphal government, and large numbers of volunteer warriors of the faith (''mujahidun'' or ''[[Ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]s'').<ref>{{cite journal| first = C.

The local governor [[Yazaman al-Khadim]] returned the city to the direct allegiance of [[Baghdad]] from 882 on, but was forced to recognise the [[Tulunids]] again in 890. Tulunid possession of the border zone lasted until the death of Ibn Tulun's heir [[Khumarawayh]] in 896, after which Caliph [[al-Mu'tadid]] ({{reign|892|902}}) re-asserted direct control.<ref>{{cite journal| first = C.

After a brief period when the border zone was under [[Ikhshidid]] control, in 946/7, Tarsus recognised the overlordship of the [[Hamdanid]] emir [[Sayf al-Dawla]] of [[Aleppo]], who had become the new master of northern Syria and the Byzantine borderlands. Facing a resurgent Byzantium, he was able to stem the tide for a while, but in 965,the Byzantine emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] ({{reign|963|969}}) captured the city, ending Muslim rule there.<ref>{{cite journal| first = C.

The terms of the city's surrender allowed any Muslim who wished to leave with as many of his possessions as he could carry. Many of those who left eventually settled, according to [[al-Muqaddasi]], at [[Baniyas]]. Most of those who remained behind became Christians and the main mosque was either torn down or turned into a stable.<ref name="EI2"/> The city remained under Byzantine rule until 1085.<ref name="ODB"/> It was thereafter disputed between Latin [[Crusaders]], Byzantines (1137‚Äì1172), [[Seljuk Turks]] and the Armenians of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] (Kingdom of Lesser Armenia).<ref name="ODB"/> The city was the capital of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] between 1080 and 1198. The Armenians became definitive masters until about 1359 when the city was captured by the [[Ramadanid Emirate]] and [[Mamluk Sultanate]]. Finally, the area was brought under the control of the [[Ottoman Empire]] by [[Selim I]] in 1516.

In the Middle Ages, Tarsus was renowned throughout the Middle East; a number of Arab writers praised it as a beautiful and well-defended city, its walls having two layers of fortifications with five gates and earthworks outside, surrounded by rich farmland and watered by the river and the lake.

===Ottoman and modern period===
{{See|Ottoman Empire}}
[[File:Ulucami, Tarsus, Mersin Province.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Tarsus Grand Mosque (Ulu Cami)]]
[[File:Kƒ±rkka≈üƒ±kBazaarTarsus (3).JPG|thumb|150px|Kƒ±rkka≈üƒ±k (Forty Teaspoons) Bazaar]]
Under Ottoman rule, Tarsus initially formed part of the [[Eyalet of Aleppo]]. After the [[Ottoman conquest of Cyprus]] in 1571 it became the seat of a ''[[sanjak]]'' (sub-province) within the [[Cyprus Eyalet]], before being transferred in 1608 to the ''sanjak'' of [[Adana]] as a ''[[kaza]]'' (district).<ref name="EI2"/>

Visiting in 1671 the traveller [[Evliya √áelebi]] recorded ''"a city on the plain, an hour from the sea, surrounded by strong walls two-storeys high, moated on all sides, with three distinct neighbourhoods inside the walls"''.

Despite its excellent defences, Tarsus was captured from the Ottomans in 1832 by the [[Mamluks]] of [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt]], son of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]], and remained for eight years in Egyptian hands. The Egyptians began growing cotton on the surrounding plain. Following the return of Ottoman rule this cotton drove substantial growth in the local economy, due to increased world demand for the crop during shortages caused by the [[U.S. Civil War]]. A new road was built to the port in [[Mersin]] and the city of Tarsus grew and thrived. Still today many large houses in the city stand as reminders of the wealth generated during this period. 

However, after 3,000 years as a flourishing port, by the end of the 19th century neglect meant Tarsus lost its access to the sea as the delta became a swamp. At this point it was a typical Ottoman city with communities of Muslim Turks, Christian Greeks and [[Armenians]]. With the founding of the [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]] in the 1920s, the swamp was drained and the River Berdan was dammed to build Turkey's first hydro-electric power station. Irrigation, roadworks and a railway brought the economy of Tarsus back to life, with new factories particularly producing textiles.

==Cuisine==
The distinctive local cuisine includes chargrilled chicken, [[hummus]] (sometimes heated and served with [[Pastirma|pastƒ±rma]]), [[≈üalgam]], [[tantuni]], miniature [[lahmacun]] called ''"fƒ±ndƒ±k lahmacun",'' and [[cezerye]], a dessert made from carrots.

==Sports==
[[File:TarsusCityStadium (5).JPG|thumb|200px|Tarsus City Stadium]]
Tarsus has two football stadiums, [[Tarsus City Stadium]] and Burhanettin Kocamaz Stadium, and an arena, Tarsus Arena. The local football club is [[Tarsus Idman Yurdu]].

==Main sites==
Tarsus city centre is home to the magnificent homes of wealthy traders, some of them restored, some still waiting a saviour. Additionally it is home to several historic sites although some are in need of restoration and research. These sites have been described by travellers for well over a century. For instance [[Blackwood's Magazine]] (Edinburgh) in 1890,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0iQfAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA616 Bent J T. Tarsus&nbsp;‚Äì Past and Present. Blackwood's Magazine (Edinburgh) Volume 148, 1890 pp 616-625]</ref> and [[H. V. Morton]]'s ''In the Steps of St Paul'' in 1936.<ref>H. V. Morton. In the Steps of St Paul, London: Rich & Cowan, 1936</ref>

The best known include:
* [[Cleopatra's Gate]]&nbsp;‚Äì to the west of the city, the only ancient city gate still standing, where Antony and Cleopatra entered the city in 41 BC, though the "restoration" of this structure has covered much of it with shiny new stone (see [http://www.abu.nb.ca/Courses/Pauline/TarsusGate2.jpg] for a picture of the gate before the work was done).
* [[Ba√ß Bridge|Roman bridge]] of [[Justinian]] over the [[Berdan River]]. It remains in good condition.
* [[Tarsus Museum]], containing many ancient coins and a severed mummified arm
* [[Roman road in Cilicia|Roman road]] north of Tarsus
* [[Ancient road in Tarsus|Ancient road]] another Roman road in the town centre
*[[Kƒ±zlar Kalesi]], a medieval castle ruin
*[[G√∂zl√ºkule]] - slight remains of original settlement mound

Sites of religious interest and pilgrimage include:
* [[Saint Paul's Church, Tarsus|St. Paul's Church]] and well (it is a museum, but occasionally Christian services take place here).
* Mosque said to be the burial place of the [[Mausoleum of Danyal|Prophet Daniel]].

From the Turkish period:
* [[Tarsus Grand Mosque]] (Ulu Cami), 16th-century mosque
* [[Kƒ±rkka≈üƒ±k Bedesten]] covered market built in 1579
* [[Bilal Habe≈üi Masjid]]
* The old baths; the dark brown spots on the white marble walls are said to be the bloodstains of [[Shahmaran|Shahmeran]], the legendary Snake King who was killed in an ambush in the baths. (''see'' [[Shahmeran Hamam]])
* "[[Nusret (ship)|Nusret]] (Nusrat)", the [[minelayer]] used to defend the Straits before the [[Battle of Gallipoli]] 

Places of natural beauty include:
* [[Tarsus Waterfall]]
*[[Karabucak Forest]], popular picnic place a few kilometres south of the city centre
