'''Atbara''' (sometimes '''Atbarah''') ({{langx|ar|عطبرة}} ʿAṭbarah) is a city located in [[River Nile State]] in northeastern [[Sudan]].<ref name=EBatbara> [http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-40468/Atbarah EB-Atbara "'Atbarah, or Atbara (The Sudan)" (description), ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 2007, webpage]</ref>

Because of its links to the railway industry, Atbara is also known as the 'Railway City'.

Atbara's population was recorded as 134,586 during the 2008 census.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=5th Population Census |url=http://cbs.gov.sd/Tiedadat/Tiedadat3e.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113151654/http://cbs.gov.sd/Tiedadat/Tiedadat3e.htm |archive-date=13 November 2009 |access-date=29 December 2023 |website=Central Bureau of Statistics}}</ref>

== History ==
The confluence of the [[Nile]] and its most northern tributary, the [[Atbarah River]]  (Bahr-el-Aswad, or Black River) was a strategic location for military operations.  in the year 1619 Atbara was conquered and sacked by forces of the [[Ethiopian Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xeM8AAAAIAAJ |title=A History of the Arbas in the Sudan and Some Account of the People who Preceded Them and of the Tribes Inhabiting Darfur3 |publisher=CUP Archive |language=en}}</ref>  In the [[Battle of Atbara]], fought on 8 April 1898 near Nakheila, on the north bank of the river, [[Herbert Kitchener, 1st Earl Kitchener|Lord Kitchener]]'s Anglo-Egyptian army defeated the [[Mahdi]]st forces, commanded by Amir Mahmud Ahmad.  Kitchener's strengthened position led to a decisive victory at the [[Battle of Omdurman]] on 2 September 1898,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=823}} giving the [[United Kingdom|British]] control over the Sudan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/gutbook/lookup?num=4943 |title=The River War from Project Gutenberg |publisher=Onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu |access-date=2013-12-10}}</ref>

The town was the centre of the [[Rail transport in Sudan|Sudanese railway industry]]. Few trains are made here now and rail traffic is much reduced. The original station and unusual dome-shaped houses of railway workers remain.  The first [[trade union]] in Sudan formed in 1946 among [[railroad]] workers in Atbara. 

Perhaps because of the influence of the railway unions, Atbara is also considered by many to be the home of Sudanese communism. [[Jaafar Nimeiri]], Sudan's president from 1969 to 1985, alternated between communism, capitalism, and Islamic fundamentalism – depending on who he was trying to get on his side and extract money from – and the communist phase had its stronghold around Atbara.

Atbara was also the starting point for [[Sudanese Revolution|mobilizations against the regime]] in December 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://orientxxi.info/magazine/les-espoirs-d-une-troisieme-revolution-au-soudan,2834|title=Les espoirs d'une troisième révolution au Soudan|first=Tarek|last=Cheikh|date=28 December 2018|website=Orient XXI}}</ref>

==Geography==
Atbara is located at the junction of the [[Nile River|Nile]] and [[Atbarah River|Atbarah]] rivers.

Atbara is made up of several districts including Umbukole district which was home to the First Higher School in Atbara. Other districts include the railway district, Almurabaat, Alsawdana and Almatar.

Umbukole was originally the name given to a capital city in a northern state in Kurti county. It is now mostly remembered as the name of a small district in Atbara.

One of the major districts of Atbara is Al-Dakhla (الداخلة) in Arabic. Some still use the name Al-Dakhla referring to Atbara.
