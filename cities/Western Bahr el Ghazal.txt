'''Western Bahr el Ghazal''' is a [[States of South Sudan|state]] in [[South Sudan]]. It has an area of {{Convert|93900|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|0}} and is the least populous state in South Sudan, according to the controversial [[Sudan]]ese census conducted in 2008. It is part of the [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] region. Its capital is [[Wau, South Sudan|Wau]]. The state shared international borders with [[Sudan]] to the north and the [[Central African Republic]] to the west. The portion now occupied by [[Raga County]] (pronounced 'Raja') is the southern part of the historical region known as "Dar Fertit".

==History==
This state, and [[Raga County]] in particular, was the part of South Sudan that was most affected by the slave trade conducted by nearby Muslim sultanates from the 18th century on and by [[Mameluk]] [[Egypt]] in the second half of the 19th century, and Raga County is the only part of South Sudan with a significant number of Muslims and Arabs. In addition to the Baggara Arabs, another local Muslim ethnic group is the Feroghe (Feroge, etc.). Traditionally, the northern part of Raga County falls within the [[Baggara Arabs|"Baggara belt"]], the 1400 kilometer wide section of the central [[Sahel]] in which cattle herding Arabic speaking tribes conduct seasonal nomadic migrations. When the slave trade soared in the 1860s and 1870s, the region's population shrank dramatically, plunging by 75 percent to about 400,000.{{sfn|Cordell|1983|p=}} Depopulation was due to several factors all related to wars that were provoked by the upsurge in slaving promoted by Egypt, factors including: actual capture of inhabitants, emigration of refugees, and epidemics. The population according to the 2008 census was lower still. This may have been partly due to the second Sudanese civil war, 1983-1999, which devastated most of South Sudan, exacting a toll of two million dead civilians and hundreds of thousands of refugees.<ref>One of them, [[Naomi Baki]], has released an autobiography in French in 2013, in which she describes her 10 years journey as a refugee from Raga to France. [[Naomi Baki]], ''Je suis encore vivante'', Le Cerf, 2013</ref>

During the Sudanese era power was controlled mainly by the [[Feroghe people|Feroghe]], including the [[National Islamic Front|NIF]] stalwart [[Ali Tamim Fartak]], who ruled Western Bahr al-Ghazal from 1992 or 1993 until 1997.<ref>{{Cite web |title=FAMINE IN SUDAN, 1998 |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/sudan/SUDAWEB2-19.htm |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=www.hrw.org}}</ref> He later served as governor of [[South Darfur]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=2004-03-11 |title=Sudan: Special Report IV: Who is who - Sudan {{!}} ReliefWeb |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/sudan/sudan-special-report-iv-who-who |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=reliefweb.int |language=en}}</ref> as Minister of Electricity and as Minister of Education.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sudan Chiefs of State 2001 - Flags, Maps, Economy, Geography, Climate, Natural Resources, Current Issues, International Agreements, Population, Social Statistics, Political System |url=https://workmall.com/wfb2001/sudan/sudan_chiefs.html |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=workmall.com}}</ref> Fartak currently leads the [[Islamic Movement for the Liberation of Raja]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-06-29 |title=Over 40 people killed in South Sudan’s town of Wau: official - South Sudan {{!}} ReliefWeb |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/south-sudan/over-40-people-killed-south-sudan-s-town-wau-official |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=reliefweb.int |language=en}}</ref>

In October 2015, Western Bahr el Ghazal was split into two new states, [[Lol State]] and [[Wau State]], following an act by President [[Salva Kiir]] to establish 32 new [[states of South Sudan]]. 

Following a peace agreement at the conclusion of the [[South Sudanese Civil War]] in 2020, Western Bahr el Ghazal was reestablished along with the rest of the original ten states of South Sudan. Kiir appointed [[Sarah Cleto Hassan]] as governor, and the only woman to be appointed of eight governors.

==Geography==
Western Bahr el Ghazal is situated in South Sudan's [[Bahr el Ghazal (region of South Sudan)|Bahr el Ghazal]] region, bordering [[Northern Bahr el Ghazal]] and [[Warrap, South Sudan|Warrap]] to the west and [[Western Equatoria]] to the south. To the north it shares a border with the states of [[South Darfur]] and [[East Darfur]] in [[Sudan]]. To the west it shares a border with [[Haute-Kotto]] and [[Haut-Mbomou]] in the [[Central African Republic]]. It claims [[Kafia Kingi]], though this is disputed by the government of Sudan, which asserts the area is a part of South Darfur. The [[Lol River]] crosses through the state.

==Demographics==
Local ethnic groups included the Luo, and [[Balanda Boor]], [[Balanda Viri people|Balanda Viri]], [[Balanda Uoyu Juku]] (Balanda Viri, Balanda Bagari)( Balanda are one people settling in different locations hence Dem Zubier, Bagari, Bazia and Tambura are geographical names not tribal. they were found in both western Equatoria and Western Bahar El Ghazal states), [[Luo peoples|Luo]], [[Ndogo people|Ndogo]], [[Kresh]], [[Bai people (Sudan)|Bai]], [[Baggara Arabs]], and many others. Despite the common element "Balanda" in their names, the first two ethnicities are not related.
