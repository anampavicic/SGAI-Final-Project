'''Latakia Governorate''', also transliterated as '''Ladhakia Governorate''', ({{langx|ar|مُحافظة اللاذقية}} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Muḥāfaẓat al-Lādhiqīyah'') is one of the 14 [[Governorates of Syria|governorates]] of [[Syria]]. It is situated in western Syria, bordering [[Turkey]]'s [[Hatay Province]] to the north, [[Idlib Governorate|Idlib]] and [[Hama Governorate]]s to the east, [[Tartus Governorate]] to the south, and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the west. Its reported area varies in different sources from {{Convert|2297|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Syria.html|title=Syria: Governorates, Major Cities & Localities - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information|website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> to {{Convert|2437|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.<ref name="Statoids">{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/usy.html|title=Syria Provinces|publisher=www.statoids.com}}</ref> The governorate has a population of 1,008,000 (2011 estimate).

== History ==
The governorate was historically part of the [[Alawite State]], which existed from 1920 to 1936.<ref name= "L">Longrigg, Stephen Hemsley. "Syria and Lebanon Under French Mandate." London: Oxford University Press, 1958.</ref>

Tartus governorate was formerly included as part of Latakia, before being split off circa 1972.<ref name="Statoids"/>

The region has been relatively peaceful during the [[Syrian civil war]], being a generally pro-[[Bashar al-Assad|Assad]] region that had largely remained under government control. The [[Free Syrian Army]] [[Battle of al-Haffah|attacked]] Al-Haffah in 2012, and unsuccessfully attempted to wrest control of the province in [[2014 Latakia offensive|2014]],<ref name="redeploy">{{cite web|title=Assad's forces deploy in Latakia to repel rebel offensive|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/middle-east/2014/04/04/Assad-s-forces-deploy-in-Latakia-to-repel-rebel-offensive.html|publisher=Al Arabiya|access-date=18 May 2014}}</ref> [[2015–16 Latakia offensive|2015]]<ref name="leithfadel">{{cite web|url=http://www.almasdarnews.com/article/syrian-army-advances-north-towards-turkish-border-latakia-3-villages-captuted/|title=Syrian Army Advances North Towards the Turkish Border in Latakia: 3 Villages Captuted|author=Leith Fadel|work=Al-Masdar News|access-date=4 December 2015}}</ref> and [[2016 Latakia offensive|2016]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/07/foreign-jihadists-advertise-role-in-latakia-fighting.php|title=Foreign jihadists advertise role in Latakia fighting|publisher=The Long War Journal|access-date=11 July 2016}}</ref> In 2016 the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]] conducted a [[May 2016 Jableh and Tartous bombings|bomb attack]] on Jableh, resulting in many deaths.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://globalnews.ca/news/2718188/suicide-bombing-killed-43-at-syrian-hospital-who/|title=Suicide bombing killed 43 at Syrian hospital: WHO|author=Philip Issa|date=24 May 2016|work=Global News|access-date=26 May 2016}}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Slinfah.png|thumb|right|[[Slinfah]], one of Syria's most famed resorts in the Syrian Coastal Mountains]]
The Latakia Governorate comprises about half of Syria's Mediterranean coastline. The western part of the governorate consists mainly of coastal plains, with the inland eastern parts being mountainous, with the [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range]] (Nusayriyah Mountains) running north to south.<ref name="Syria-profile">Federal Research Division, Library of Congress (2005) [http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Syria.pdf "Country Profile: Syria"] page 5</ref> Its highest peak, Nabi Yunis, is 1,562 meters (5,125&nbsp;ft) tall with the average elevation only about 1,200 meters.<ref name="Syria-profile"/> The western areas of the governorate catch moisture-laden winds from the Mediterranean Sea and are thus more fertile and more heavily populated than the eastern slopes.

The [[Orontes River]] flows north alongside the range on its eastern verge in the [[Al-Ghab Plain]], a {{convert|64|km}} [[Trench#Geology|longitudinal trench]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Syria|title=Syria - History, People, & Maps|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> and then around the northern edge of the range to flow into the Mediterranean. Another important river is [[Nahr al-Kabir al-Shamali]], a river running from the Turkish [[Syria-Turkey border|border]] and to the southwest to flow in the Mediterranean, with the 16 Tishreen dam, one of the most important in the region, being constructed for power generation, storage of rain and river water, and the creation of [[Lake 16 Teshreen|Mashqita Lake]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gors.sy/Download/%D9%86%D9%87%D8%B1%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D8%A8%D9%8A%D8%B1%20%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B4%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%8A.pdf|title= المراقبة والإدارة البیئیة لنھر الكبیر الشمالي|language=ar}}</ref>

===Cities===
[[Latakia]] is the regional capital; other major settlements include [[Al-Haffah]], Ibn Hani, [[Jableh]], [[Kessab]], Manjila, Qaranjah, [[Qardaha]] and [[Salma, Syria|Salma]].

==Economy==
[[File:Latakia harbour.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Port of Latakia]], Syria's main seaport]]
The governorate is located on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], which gave it great economic importance, with the capital of the governorate, [[Latakia]] serving as Syria's main port. Its [[Port of Latakia|port]] was established on 12 February 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lattakiaport.gov.sy/index.php?m=52|title=حول مرفأ اللاذقية - مرفأ اللاذقية|website=www.lattakiaport.gov.sy}}</ref>

Its imported cargo includes clothing, construction materials, vehicles, furniture, minerals, tobacco, cotton, and food supplies such as lintels, onions, wheat, barley, dates, grains and figs; in 2008, the port handled about 8 million tons of cargo.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}
