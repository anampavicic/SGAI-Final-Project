==History==
Matsusaka developed as a commercial center during the [[Sengoku period]], and [[Oda Nobukatsu]], the younger son of [[Oda Nobunaga]] built a [[Japanese castle|castle]] in the area in 1580. The area came under the control of [[Gamō Ujisato]] shortly thereafter, and the Gamō began construction of a castle in the {{nihongo|Yoiho forest|四五百森|Yoiho no mori}} and named the site "Matsusaka," meaning "slope (坂) covered with pines (松)" in 1588. [[Matsusaka Castle]] was the center of the short-lived [[Matsusaka Domain]] in the early [[Tokugawa shogunate]], but for most of the [[Edo period]], the castle was the eastern outpost of [[Kishu Domain]] based at [[Wakayama Castle]].

Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the area became part of Mie Prefecture. The town of Matsusaka was created on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The second ''[[kanji]]'' character of Matsusaka was changed to 阪 from 坂 in those days. On March 26, 1893, 1318 houses in the town were destroyed in a fire. Matsusaka was raised to city status on February 1, 1933. The city suffered only light damage in [[World War II]], when an air raid killed four people on February 4, 1945. About 700 houses in the city were destroyed by a fire on December 16, 1951. On October 15, 1956, a major [[Rokken rail accident|railway accident]] occurred at [[Rokken Station (Mie)|Rokken Station]] on the outskirts of the city, killing 42 people. On August 1, 1982, [[Typhoon Bess (1982)|Typhoon Bess]] left nine people dead in its wake. The city officially celebrated its 500th anniversary in 1988.

On January 1, 2005, the city expanded to its present borders, with the absorption the towns of [[Mikumo, Mie|Mikumo]] and [[Ureshino, Mie|Ureshino]] (both from [[Ichishi District, Mie|Ichishi District]]), and the towns of [[Iinan, Mie|Iinan]] and [[Iitaka, Mie|Iitaka]] (both from [[Iinan District, Mie|Iinan District]]).

==Government==
Matsusaka has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Matsusaka contributes four members to the Mie Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Mie 1st district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Education==
Matsusaka has 36 public elementary schools and 12 public middle schools operated by the city government and four public high schools operated by the Mie Prefectural Board of Education. There are also one private middle school and two private high schools. The prefectural also operates two special education schools for the handicapped. [[Mie Chukyo University]], formerly located in Matsusaka, closed in 2013.
