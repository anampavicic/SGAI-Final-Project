== History ==
Mimaropa, together with [[Calabarzon]], were officially created with the [[partition (politics)|partitioning]] of [[Southern Tagalog]] (Region IV) into the two regions on May 17, 2002, with the issuance of ''Executive Order No. 103'' by then-President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]]; for the purpose of promoting efficiency in the government, accelerating social and economic development and improving public services in the provinces covered. Region IV-B was designated as Mimaropa, which stands for the island provinces belonging to the Southern Tagalog region—[[Mindoro Island|Mindoro]] ([[Oriental Mindoro|Oriental]] and [[Occidental Mindoro|Occidental]]), [[Marinduque]], [[Romblon]] and [[Palawan]]. Region IV-A was designated as Calabarzon.<ref name=PSA-NSCB /> Marinduque was a sub-province of [[Quezon]], at that time known as Tayabas; it became independent province in 1920. Quezon is now part of Calabarzon. Romblon was a sub-province of [[Capiz]] & was part of Western Visayas. When President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] enacted ''Presidential Decree No. 1'', which organized the provinces into 11 regions as part of Marcos' Integrated Reorganization Plan,<ref name="PD1">{{cite act |date=September 24, 1972 |title=Reorginazing the Executive Branch of the National Government |type= Presidential Decree |number=1 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1972/09/24/presidential-decree-no-1-s-1972/ |access-date=April 12, 2017}}</ref> Romblon was transferred from Western Visayas to Southern Tagalog.

On May 23, 2005, ''Executive Order 429'' was issued, moving the province of [[Palawan]] to the region of [[Western Visayas]],<ref name=PSA-NSCB[2] /> designating Region IV-B as "Mimaro". However, Palawan residents criticized the move, citing a lack of consultation, with most residents in [[Puerto Princesa]] and nearly all municipalities preferring to stay with Region IV-B. Consequently, ''Administrative Order No. 129'' was issued on August 19, 2005, to address this backlash. This order directed the abeyance of ''Executive Order 429'' pending the approval of an implementation plan for the orderly transfer of Palawan from Mimaropa to Region VI.<ref name="AO129"/>

The 2010 Philippine Census of Population reported the region's name as "Mimaropa" and included [[Palawan]] as part of the region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://census.gov.ph/data/census2010/index.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120707155208/http://census.gov.ph/data/census2010/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 7, 2012 |title=Population and Annual Growth Rates by Province, City, and Municipality : Region IVB - MIMAROPA: 1990, 2000, and 2010 |work=2010 Philippine Census of Population |publisher=Census.gov.ph }}</ref> {{as of|2014}}, it is not clear whether the transfer of Palawan to [[Western Visayas]] is still considered pending by the Philippine government. {{as of|2014}}, the National Statistical Coordinating Board of the Philippines continued to list Palawan province as part of the Mimaropa region.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/regview.asp?region=17|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802172716/http://nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/regview.asp?region=17|archivedate=August 2, 2014 |title=Region: REGION IV-B (MIMAROPA)|work=National Statistical Coordinating Board of the Philippines|access-date=May 26, 2012}}</ref>{{update after|2014|reason=final official status of EO429 is undetermined}}

On July 17, 2016, ''Republic Act No. 10879'' formally established the ''Southwestern Tagalog Region'' to be known as the Mimaropa Region. This involved no boundary changes but was in effect merely a renaming and discontinuation of the "Region IV-B" designation.<ref name="RA10869" />

In 2007, Mimaropa's economy surged by 9.4%, making it the fastest growing region in the country in that year.<ref name="GRDP2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/grdp/2007/default.asp|title=NSCB - 2007 Gross Regional Domestic Product|date=July 28, 2008|publisher=National Statistical Coordination Board|access-date=May 18, 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420214409/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/grdp/2007/default.asp|archivedate=April 20, 2009}}</ref> It was aided by robust growth in the industrial sector which grew by 19.1% from -6.1% in 2006.<ref name="GRDP2007" /> Mimaropa experienced a big slowdown in 2006, posting a decelerated growth of 2.3% from a 6.4% increase in 2005. This resulted mainly from the slump in the industry sector, which shrunk by 5.4% in 2006 from its 10.8% increase in 2005.

The agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector, which contributed 42.1% to the total regional economy, grew by 9.1% in 2006, accelerating from 3.2% the previous year. The higher production of [[rice]], [[maize]], other crops, livestock and fishery resulted in the accelerated growth in the total agriculture and fishery sector.

The industry sector, which contributed 38.3% to the region's total economy, was the second largest contributor next to agriculture. Its decline of 5.4% was largely attributed to the decrease in the mining and quarrying sub-sector, which went down by 15.4% due to the reduced production of natural gas in Palawan. Mining and quarrying contributed 16.6% to the total regional economy. The positive growth in the electricity and water, construction and manufacturing sub-sectors were not able to compensate to the drop in the mining and quarrying sub-sector.

The service sector, on the other hand, posted an accelerated growth of 5.1%, which was attributed to the increase in the TCS, finance, private services, government services and trade sub-sectors, which managed to post accelerated growths of 6.0%, 5.5%, 5.1%, 5.1% and 4.7%, respectively. The other sub-sector, however, had a decelerated growth due to the slowdown in the ownership of dwelling.
