'''Juazeiro''', formerly also known as '''Joazeiro''',<ref>* {{cite EB1911 |mode=cs2 |last=Lamoureaux |first=Andrew Jackson  |wstitle=Bahia (city) |volume=3 |ref={{harvid|''EB''|1911}} |page=210 }}</ref> is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the state of [[Bahia]], in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeastern region]] of Brazil.

The city is twinned with [[Petrolina]], in the state of [[Pernambuco]]. The two cities are connected by a modern bridge crossing the [[São Francisco River]]. Together they form the metropolitan region of Petrolina-Juazeiro, an urban conglomerate of close to 500,000 inhabitants.

== History ==

It was founded in 1833 [http://www.citybrazil.com.br/ba/juazeiro/] and became a city on July 15, 1878.
Its name comes from the {{interlanguage link|Juá|pt}} tree which grows in the region.

== Organization ==

Its city districts are Abóbora, Carnaíba, Itamotinga, Junco, Juremal, Massaroca, and Pinhões.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

==Geography==
=== Climate ===
The annual average temperature is {{convert|26|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}. Although it lies on the [[São Francisco River]] and the [[Curaçá River]], Juazeiro is one of the driest places in Brazil, with a [[hot semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh'') that is very close to being classified as a [[hot arid climate]] (''BWh'').

== Transport ==
[[File:Juazeiro - State of Bahia, Brazil.jpg|right|thumb|220px|Presidente Dutra bridge over [[São Francisco River]] connects Juazeiro and Petrolina]]

There are highway connections with several capitals of the Northeast and railroad connections to the coast are made by the [[:pt:Ferrovia Centro-Atlântica|Ferrovia Centro-Atlântica]]. The railroad connection ends at the fluvial port of Juazeiro.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

== Economy ==

Like its sister city [[Petrolina]], Juazeiro has experienced great growth in the last decade due to the irrigation of the semi-arid soils with water from the [[São Francisco River]]. [[fruits|Fruit cultivation]] is important to such an extent that Juazeiro entitles itself "Capital of Irrigated Fruit", which is exported between the [[Petrolina Airport]] to United States and/or [[EU|Europe]]. For more detailed information on the development of this fertile valley see the article on [[Petrolina]].
