{{Nihongo|'''Fukui Prefecture'''|福井県|Fukui-ken}} is a [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]] of [[Japan]] located in the [[Chūbu region]] of [[Honshū]].<ref>Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "Fukui-ken" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 217|page=217}}; "Chūbu" {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 126|page=126}}.</ref> Fukui Prefecture has a population of 778,943 (1 June 2017) and has a geographic area of 4,190 [[Square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] (1,617 [[sq mi]]). Fukui Prefecture borders [[Ishikawa Prefecture]] to the north, [[Gifu Prefecture]] to the east, [[Shiga Prefecture]] to the south, and [[Kyoto Prefecture]] to the southwest.

[[Fukui, Fukui|Fukui]] is the capital and largest city of Fukui Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Sakai, Fukui|Sakai]], [[Echizen, Fukui|Echizen]], and [[Sabae, Fukui|Sabae]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Fukui" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 217|page=217}}.</ref> Fukui Prefecture is located on the [[Sea of Japan]] coast and is part of the historic [[Hokuriku region]] of Japan. The [[Matsudaira clan]], a powerful ''[[samurai]]'' clan during the [[Edo period]] that became a component of the [[Kazoku|Japanese nobility]] after the [[Meiji Restoration]], was headquartered at [[Fukui Castle]] on the site of the modern prefectural offices. Fukui Prefecture is home to the [[Kitadani Formation]], the [[Ichijōdani Asakura Family Historic Ruins]], and the [[Tōjinbō]] cliff range.

== Prehistory ==
The [[Kitadani Dinosaur Quarry]], on the Sugiyama River within the city limits of Katsuyama, has yielded animals such As ''[[Fukuiraptor]]'', ''[[Fukuisaurus]]'', ''[[Nipponosaurus]]'', ''[[Koshisaurus]]'', [[Fukuivenator]],'' ''[[Fukuititan]],'' and ''[[Tambatitanis]],''  as well as an unnamed [[dromaeosaurid]].

== History ==
{{See also|Historic Sites of Fukui Prefecture}}

Fukui originally consisted of the [[Old provinces of Japan|old provinces]] of [[Wakasa Province|Wakasa]] and [[Echizen Province|Echizen]], before the prefecture was formed in 1871.<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|''Japan Encyclopedia'', p. 780|page=780}}.</ref>

During the [[Edo period]], the ''[[daimyō]]'' of the region was surnamed [[Matsudaira]], and was a descendant of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]].

During [[World War II]], Fukui was heavily bombed and its palace, [[Fukui Castle]], surrounded by a moat, was demolished. Buildings for the Fukui Prefectural government were built on the site of the castle.

{{clear}}

== Geography ==
Fukui faces the [[Sea of Japan]], and has a western part (formerly Wakasa) which is a narrow plain between the mountains and the sea, and a larger eastern part (formerly Echizen) with wider plains including the capital and most of the population. The province lies within Japan's "[[Snow country (Japan)|Snow country]]".
