'''La Rioja''' ({{IPA|es|la ˈrjoxa|lang}}) is an [[autonomous communities in Spain|autonomous community]] and [[provinces of Spain|province]] in [[Spain]], in the north of the Iberian Peninsula. Its capital is [[Logroño]]. Other [[List of municipalities in La Rioja|cities and towns in the province]] include [[Calahorra]], [[Arnedo]], [[Alfaro, La Rioja|Alfaro]], [[Haro, La Rioja|Haro]], [[Santo Domingo de la Calzada]], and [[Nájera]]. It has an estimated population of 315,675 inhabitants (INE 2018), making it the least populated autonomous community of Spain.

It covers part of the [[Ebro]] valley towards its north and the Iberian Range in the south. The community is a single province, so there is no [[Provincial deputation (Spain)|provincial deputation]], and it is organized into 174 municipalities. It borders the Basque Country (province of [[Álava (province)|Álava]]) to the north, [[Navarre]] to the northeast, [[Aragón]] to the southeast ([[province of Zaragoza]]), and [[Castilla y León]] to the west and south (provinces of [[Burgos (province)|Burgos]] and [[Province of Soria|Soria]]).

The area was once occupied by pre-Roman [[Berones]], [[Pellendones]] and [[Vascones]]. After partial recapture from the [[Muslim]]s in the early tenth century, the region became part of the [[Kingdom of Pamplona]], later being incorporated into Castile after a century and a half of disputes. From the eighteenth century the Rioja region remained divided between the provinces of Burgos and Soria, until in 1833 the province of Logroño was created, changing the name of the province to La Rioja in 1980 as a prelude to its constitution under a single provincial autonomous community in 1982. The name "Rioja" (from [[Oja (river)|Río Oja]]) is first attested in 1099.

The region is well known for [[Rioja (wine)|its wines]] under the brand ''[[Rioja (wine)|Denominación de Origen Calificada Rioja]]''.

==History==
[[File:Façade of Santa María de la Redonda in Logroño.jpg|thumb|Santa María de la Redonda Co-cathedral, Logroño.]]
[[Image:Valle-de-San-Millán.jpg|thumb|Monasterios de San Millán de Yuso]]
===Roman and Muslim periods===
{{unreferencedsect|date=October 2022}}
In Roman times, the territory of La Rioja was inhabited by the tribes of the [[Berones]] (central country), [[Autrigones]] (upper country, extending also north and west of it) and the [[Vascones]] (lower country, extending also north and east of it). It was part of the province of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]].

In medieval times, La Rioja was often a disputed territory. The [[Visigoths]] created the [[Duchy of Cantabria]] that probably included most of La Rioja, as a border [[Marches|march]] against the [[Vascones]]. After the [[Early Muslim conquests|Muslim invasion]] of AD 711, La Rioja fell into the Muslim domains of [[Al Andalus]].

===Medieval period===
Most of the territory was reconquered in 923 by [[Sancho I of Pamplona]], acting for the Kingdom of Pamplona together with the Kingdom of León and the Counts of Castile, feudal lords of the Leonese King. The lower region around [[Arnedo]] came under control of his allies the [[Banu Qasi]] of [[Tudela, Navarre|Tudela]]. The territory to the east of the Leza River remained under Muslim control.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

Later there was a dispute between Count [[Fernán González of Castile]] and the kings of Pamplona-Navarra, involving great battles. It was decided in favour of the Navarrese after the imprisonment of the Count's family in Cirueña, in 960.<ref name="Turza">{{Cite book |title= La Rioja entre Navarra y Castilla.

Sancho Garcés moved the capital of the Kingdom of Pamplona to Nájera (La Rioja), creating the so-called kingdom of Nájera-Pamplona which was, due to its large size, the first Spanish Empire.{{cn|date=October 2022}} After the independence of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] in 1035, this new kingdom fiercely fought against Pamplona for the possession of [[Bureba]], La Rioja and other territories. In 1076, after the murder of [[Sancho IV of Navarre|Sancho IV]], Navarre was divided among Castile and Aragon. Castile obtained La Rioja, together with other Navarrese lands.<ref name="Turza"/> The name "La Rioja" first appears in written records in the Miranda de Ebro charter of 1099. The territory was centred on the fortified site of Logroño: the 12th-century church Iglesia de Santa Maria de Palacio recalls its origin as a chapel of the administrative palace. Logroño was a [[Marches|borderland]] disputed between the [[kings of Navarre]] and the [[kings of Castile]] from the 10th century;

From 1134 the Navarrese under [[García Ramírez of Navarre|García Ramírez]] ("the Restorer") and his son [[Sancho V of Navarre|Sancho VI]] ("the Wise") fought bitterly with Castile for the recovery of the former Pamplonese domains.{{cn|date=October 2022}} The region was awarded to [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]] in a judgement by [[Henry II of England]] and annexed in 1177. Its importance lay in part in the pilgrimage route to [[Santiago de Compostela]], the ''[[Way of St. James|Camino de Santiago]]'', which crossed the River Ebro on the stone bridge, the ''Puente de Piedra''.

===Province of Logroño===
{{unreferencedsect|date=October 2022}}
[[File:Mapa de La Rioja de Tomás López, año 1769.jpg|thumb|Map of La Rioja by [[Tomás López de Vargas Machuca]], year 1769]]
In the 18th century, the territory remained divided between the intendences of [[Burgos (intendence)|Burgos]] and [[Soria (intendence)|Soria]]. The region was taken by Napoleonic forces in the [[Peninsular War]] and remained solidly in French hands until 1814. In the 1810 project of [[Juan Antonio Llorente|Llorente]] it was to be a part of the [[prefecture]] of [[Arlanzón, Province of Burgos|Arlanzón]] with its capital in [[Burgos]]. The [[Cortes of Cádiz]] declared La Rioja an independent province at the time of the Liberal [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Constitution of 1812]], and during the [[Liberal Triennium]] in January 1822 the province of Logroño was created by royal decree as part of the administrative reform of [[Rafael del Riego|Riego]], taking in the whole of the historical territory of La Rioja. However, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] soon annulled these decisions and restored most of the previous territorial divisions. In [[1833 territorial division of Spain|the 1833 reorganization]], a province of Logroño was again formed within the region of [[Castilla la Vieja]]. The province increased its territory temporarily in 1841.

===Autonomous community===
In 1980 the province changed its name to La Rioja, and following the adoption of the Estatuto de San Millán in 1982, during the reorganization following the [[Spanish transition to democracy]], it was constituted as a uni-provincial [[autonomous communities of Spain|autonomous community]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.larioja.org/nuestra_comunidad/estatuto/index.htm |title=Gobierno de la Rioja |access-date=2007-04-07 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070417205734/http://www.larioja.org/nuestra_comunidad/estatuto/index.htm |archive-date=2007-04-17 }} Statute of Autonomy (in Spanish)</ref> It is the second-smallest autonomous community in Spain and has the smallest population; half of its 174 municipalities have populations under 200. Nearly half of its citizens live in the capital.

== Etymology ==
{{main|Etymology of La Rioja}}
The [[etymology]] of the [[Toponymy|toponym]] Rioja is complex and has been much discussed. The main [[Theory|theories]] point to different origins: the traditional popular one that makes it correspond to the [[Oja (river)|river Oja]], the one that points to the term ''Rivalia'' that would be translated as "land of streams", the one that points as germ a nominal [[Tautology (language)|tautology]] in the term ''rivo Ohia'' that would mean "river of fluvial bed"; and the very diverse ones that indicate that it would have its origins in the [[Basque language]], for example as union of the words ''herria'' and ''ogia'' being translated as "land of bread".

Numerous authors from different periods have proposed different theories about it, such as the friar [[Mateo Anguiano]] in the 18th century, [[Ángel Casimiro de Govantes]] in the 19th century, [[Ramón Menéndez Pidal|Menéndez Pidal]] or [[Merino Urrutia]] in the 20th century, or in the 21st century, the researcher Eduardo Aznar Martínez. In addition, there are texts by older authors such as [[Florian Ocampo|Florián de Ocampo]] in the 16th century or [[Rodrigo Méndez Silva]] in the 17th century, which give an account of the [[False etymology|popular etymology]] of the toponym.

The first written appearances of this toponym as ''Rioga'' or ''Riogam'' date back to the 11th century, and it can also be found with different spellings such as ''Rioxa, Riogia, Rivo de Oia, Rivogio'' or in its definitive form ''Rioja'' in texts of later centuries. On the other hand, the oldest document found in which its [[demonym]] appears dates from the 13th century, with the spellings ''riogeñ'' and ''riogensi'', that is, Riojan (''[[Spanish language|Spanish]]: riojano'').

In the first written appearances of this toponym in the 11th century, the westernmost area of the present-day Spanish region is designated under the same name; therefore, the primitive Rioja was the territory around the basins of the rivers [[Tirón River|Tirón]] and [[Oja (river)|Oja]], with some divergences in its exact location by different authors. Gradually and as a result of various historical events, the toponym was extended from the [[Middle Ages]], to name a larger region, consisting of seven [[Valley|river valleys]], located between the Tirón in the west and the [[Alhama (river)|Alhama]] in the east, which flow into the [[Ebro]], namely La Rioja today.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Granado Hijelmo |first=Ignacio |title=La Rioja como sistema |year=1993 |isbn=84-8125-033-3 |volume=III |pages=1702–1703 |language=es |chapter=Chapter 2: 2.2.

==Geography==
[[File:Peciña_01.jpg|thumb|View of La Rioja]]
La Rioja is bordered by the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] (province of [[Álava]]), [[Navarre]], [[Aragon|Aragón]] (province of [[Zaragoza (province)|Zaragoza]]), and [[Castile-Leon|Castile and León]] (provinces of [[Soria (province)|Soria]] and [[Burgos (province)|Burgos]]). The river [[Ebro]] flows through this region, as does the river [[Oja (river)|Oja]], after which it is named.

The Ebro runs through the north of the community. The entire right bank (which is to the south) belongs to La Rioja. There are only three municipalities, [[Briñas]], [[San Vicente de la Sonsierra]] and [[Ábalos]] on the left bank (known as the Riojan Sonsierra), although Logroño, [[Agoncillo, La Rioja|Agoncillo]], [[Alcanadre]], [[Rincón de Soto]] and Alfaro also have parts of their respective municipal territories on that bank. Because of their proximity{{citation needed|date=October 2023}}, the [[Álava]] area between the Ebro and the [[Sierra de Cantabria]] is called [[Rioja Alavesa]].

===Climate===
The climate is mainly [[Continental climate|continental]]. The Rioja Alta comarca receives more precipitation than Rioja Baja. The average temperature ranges from {{convert|11.8|-|31.8|°C}} and the precipitation ranges between {{convert|300|-|500|mm|in|abbr=on}} as an annual average.<ref name="weather">
{{cite web

	| title = weather in la rioja
	| access-date = 29 January 2024|language=es}}</ref> The wind called ''[[Cierzo]]'' is very frequent around La Rioja during the winter.

===Mountains and mountain ranges===
The mountains in La Rioja are part of the [[Sistema Ibérico|Iberian System]]. This mountain range extends to the south of the Ebro river, parallel to it at a distance of about {{convert|40|to|60|km|abbr=in}}, with altitudes ranging between {{convert|1000|and|2000|m|ft|abbr=in}}. From the mountain range the [[Sierra de la Demanda]] runs northwards, into the heart of La Rioja, incorporating [[Monte San Lorenzo, La Rioja|Monte San Lorenzo]] which, at {{convert|2271|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is the highest peak in the province. Other mountains include [[Sierra de Camero Viejo]], [[Sierra de Camero Nuevo]], [[Sierra de Cebollera]], and [[Picos de Urbión]].

===Hydrography===
[[File:Rio_Ebro,_heart_of_La_Rioja.jpg|thumb|The river [[Ebro]] in La Rioja]]

The [[Ebro]] is the main river passing through the community. Emerging from the narrow channel between the rocks of the [[Conchas de Haro]], it reaches La Rioja, through which it runs for {{convert|120|km|abbr=in}}, before continuing its journey to the Mediterranean. In the Conchas de Haro the altitude of the river is {{convert|445|m|abbr=on}} and when it leaves the community, in the Sotos del Ebro Natural Reserve in [[Alfaro, La Rioja|Alfaro]], it is {{convert|260|m|abbr=on}} high. The river therefore flows very quickly through La Rioja.{{original research inline|date=October 2013}}

Seven rivers descend rapidly towards the Ebro from the mountain range, which is why La Rioja is sometimes called: "Zone of the seven valleys". They are, from east to west, [[Alhama (river)|Alhama]], [[Cidacos]], Leza, Iregua, [[Najerilla (river)|Najerilla]], [[Oja (river)|Oja]] and [[Tirón River|Tirón]], although the headwaters of the Alhama and Cidacos originate in [[Soria]] and those of Najerilla-Neila and Tirón are from Burgos. Sometimes Linares (a tributary of Alhama) is added, grouping Tirón with its tributary, the Oja.

All the rivers of these valleys form tributaries that go on to form many valleys in their own right, such as those of Linares, Ocon, Jubera, Tuerto, Brieva, Viniegras and San Millán. There is an almost unlimited number of grandiose canyons, quite splendid in nature, such as Aguas Buenas, Nieva, Manzanares, Ardancha, Navajún, Valderresa, Ollora, Tobia, San Martín and others.

===Flora and fauna===
In the highlands [[oak]]s, [[beech]] and [[pine]] are grown. There are also thickets of [[juniper]], [[Buxus|boxwood]], [[sloes]], [[holly]] and [[cistus]]. [[Thyme]], [[rosemary]], [[Juniperus communis|common juniper]], and [[Quercus rotundifolia|holm oak]] are present. There are grand hillsides with fine pasture for livestock, cattle and sheep. In the lower areas there are oaks, olive and almond trees. Near the Ebro, in the plains, the land is used for cereal, sugar beet and potatoes, while the hills are covered with vast vineyards of the wine that has brought worldwide fame to this region.

All Riojan rivers, including the Ebro, have a row of poplars and cottonwood. About the Riojan Alamos [[Ana Maria Matute]] has written: "... see them on the edge of the water, turning the landscape, like spears magical pointing towards the unreal and mysterious country of the riverbed."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.europamundo.com/guiaspdf/LA%20RIOJA.pdf |title=Guía de La Rioja |access-date=12 January 2013 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303233804/http://www.europamundo.com/guiaspdf/LA%20RIOJA.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Natural resources===
[[Gypsum]] and [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] are mined. [[Arnedillo]] is a [[spa town]].

===Dinosaur footprints===
[[File:Enciso-dinosaur-footprint-detail.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Dinosaur footprints|Footprints]] of a [[Theropoda]] found near [[Enciso, La Rioja|Enciso]].]]

During the [[Early Cretaceous]] period the geographical area of [[Cameros]] was part of a flooded plain that drained periodically, leaving behind muddy areas where dinosaur tracks marked the path. Eventually they were dried and covered with new sediment layers whose weight pressed down on the lower layers, causing them to solidify into rocks over millions of years. Erosion has been wearing down the upper layers making many of these rock formations visible, bringing into view the fossilized footprints. La Rioja is notable for the number and conservation of these sites, in addition to those found in the north of [[Soria]], such as [[Yanguas]], [[Santa Cruz de Yanguas]] and other highland locations.<ref name="IgeaBaryonix">{{Cite web |url=http://www.abc.es/hemeroteca/historico-26-07-2006/abc/Sociedad/fosiles-de-la-rioja-permiten-reconstruir-totalmente-el-dinosaurio-%27baryonix%27-_1422615003026.html |title=Fósiles de La Rioja permiten reconstruir totalmente el dinosaurio 'Baryonix' (Fossils of La Rioja allow the full reconstruction of the 'Baryonix' dinosaur)|date=26 July 2006 |language=es}}</ref>
