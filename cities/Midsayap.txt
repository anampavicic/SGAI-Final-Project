'''Midsayap''', officially the '''Municipality of Midsayap''' ([[Maguindanao language|Maguindanaon]]: ''Inged nu Midsayap'', [[Jawi Alphabet|Jawi]]: ايڠد نو ميدسايڤ; [[Iranun language|Iranun]]: ''Inged a Midsayap'', ايڠد نو ميدسايۏ; {{langx|hil|Banwa sang Midsayap}}; {{langx|ceb|Lungsod sa Midsayap}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Midsayap}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|Province]] of [[Cotabato]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 117,365 people.{{PH census|current}}

==History==
Midsayap was derived from a [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanaon]] term which means (Mid) Center and (Sayap) Straw Hat. Midsayap means a straw hat at the center – just like a hill centrally located at the Municipality which slopes through the plains in a shape of a hat.  Other version relates that Midsayap came from a [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanaon]] term which means "person wore a straw hat". From 1912 to 1926, Midsayap was then a district of Dulawan and [[Pikit]]. Originally, Midsayap was inhabited by Muslims from the descendants of Sultan Ali Bayao from the lineage of Sultan Dipatuan Kudarat I. The seat of their sultanate was established at Libungan Torreta (now part of Pigcawayan).

In 1927, a Philippine Constabulary (PC) Commander assigned in the area, Ist Lt. Catalino Javier, initiated the development of some portions of the municipality. Seeing the natural bounty of the area, he invited settlers from Luzon and Visayas to migrate in the area. The first wave of settlers who dared develop the wilderness was the late Antonio Labasan from Zambales. Among his companions were 23 interrelated families, the Rosete, Almazan, Dumlaos, Flautas, Fernandezes, QuiÑones,Fermils, Fantones and Documos who settled at Sitio Salunayan and Bual . Visayan settlers from Pikit also came to settle at Bual - the place of Datu Guiambangan Dilangalen. The Visayan migrants were headed by Gregorio Bingil, Julio Anito and Tomas Cantoy.
The idea of making Midsayap as a separate political district from the mother municipalities of Dulawan and Pikit was envisioned in 1930 by a group of Christian PC enlisted men who were assigned at Camp Ward. Their efforts, through the support of the deputy governor and military governor was realized in 1936.

Pursuant to Executive Order No. 66 dated November 25, 1936, Midsayap was created as a separate municipality. On January 1, 1937, it was inaugurated with Lorenzo Gonzales as its first appointed municipal mayor. In 1939, Juan Jaranilla became the first elected mayor of the municipality and served in that position until 1941.<ref name=nscb2>{{cite web |url=http://nap.psa.gov.ph/ru12/Municipal%20Profile/Midsayap/History.htm |title=History of Midsayap |publisher=National Statistical Coordination Board }}</ref>

Midsayap started with 71 barangays. Later, it was trimmed down to 42 when Libungan was separated from Midsayap in 1936. At present, Midsayap has 57 barangays. Population settlements were concentrated on the barangays of Sinawingan, Salunayan, Bual, Kapayawi, Barongis, Kimagango, Kiwanan, Katingawan, Ulamian, Baguer, Kapinpilan, Olandang, San Mateo, and Baliki. The following years showed the growth of the newly formed town. Gradually, new towns has been created. These are [[Pigcawayan]] (Pigkawayan), [[Libungan]], [[Alamada]], and lastly in 1982, [[Aleosan]].

Before the creation of the [[Bangsamoro Special Geographic Area]] in 2019, Midsayap was the most populous settlement in the province of North Cotabato. With the creation of the aforementioned area, several of its barangays were carved out from the municipality and were thus duly turned over to the [[Bangsamoro]] government, creating special governance clusters in their place, thus its area of jurisdiction as well as its population and number of barangays was reduced to its current status. While still a large town despite the reduction, it is one of the oldest settlements of migrants from Luzon and the Visayas, thereby giving its reputation as the highly heterogeneous society in this once Muslim-dominated place of Mindanaon.

==Geography==
Midsayap is geographically located at the Southwestern portion of North Cotabato Province. It is bounded on the north by the Municipality of Libungan; on the south by the [[Rio Grande de Mindanao]]; on the east by the municipalities of Aleosan and Pikit; and on the west by the Municipality of Kabuntalan.

Midsayap is approximately {{Convert|47|km}} away from [[Cotabato City]] and some {{Convert|174|km}} from [[Davao City]], two of the major urban centers in Mindanao. It is about {{Convert|64|km}} away from Kidapawan City, the seat of the Provincial Government.

Midsayap has a total land area of 29,042 hectares comprising 57 barangays which is 5.03% of the total land area of Cotabato province. Some of the barangays (Southern and Western part) are along the big bodies of water, thus making it accessible by water transportation. However, due to the construction of a concrete bridge at Dulawan towards the province of Sultan Kudarat and some municipalities of Maguindanao Province, land transportation is now feasible. The town is traversed by the Davao-Cotabato and the Midsayap-Makar national highways (General Santos).<ref name=nscb>{{cite web |url=http://www.nscb.gov.ph/ru12/Municipal%20Profile/Midsayap/Profile.htm |title=Midsayap Municipal Profile |publisher=National Statistical Coordination Board }}</ref>
