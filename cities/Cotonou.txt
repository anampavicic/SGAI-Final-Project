==History==
[[File:Fort de Cotonou-1900 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Fort of Cotonou in 1900]]
{{see also|Timeline of Cotonou}}
The name "Cotonou" means "by the river of death" in the [[Fon language]].<ref name="Bradt">Butler, Stuart (2019) ''Bradt Travel Guide - Benin'', pgs. 74-91</ref> At the beginning of the 19th century, Cotonou (then spelled "Kutonou") was a small fishing village, and is thought to have been formally founded by King [[Ghezo]] of [[Dahomey]] in 1830.<ref name="Bradt"/> It grew as a centre for the [[History of slavery|slave trade]], and later [[palm oil]] and [[cotton]].<ref name="Bradt"/> In 1851 the [[French Second Republic]] made a treaty with King Ghezo that allowed them to establish a trading post at Cotonou.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Benin - History|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Benin|access-date=2021-07-06|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> During the reign of King [[Glele]] (1858–89), the territory was ceded to the [[Second French Empire]] by a treaty signed in 1878.<ref>Mathurin C. Houngnikpo, Samuel Decalo, ''Historical Dictionary of Benin'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2013, p. 117</ref> In 1883, the [[French Navy]] occupied the city to prevent British conquest of the area. 

After Glele's death in 1889, King [[Béhanzin]] unsuccessfully tried to challenge the treaty. The town grew rapidly following the building of the harbour in 1908.<ref name="Bradt" />

The population in 1960 was only 70,000.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Benin Population (2021) - Worldometer|url=https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/benin-population/|access-date=2021-07-06|website=www.worldometers.info|language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Lagoon in Cotonou02.jpg|thumb|The [[Ouémé River]] as it flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Cotonou]]
Cotonou is on the coastal strip between [[Lake Nokoué]] and the Atlantic Ocean. The city is cut in two by a canal, the lagoon of Cotonou, dug by the French in 1855. Three bridges are in this area. The [[Ouémé River]] flows into the Atlantic Ocean at Cotonou.
[[File:Akpakpa bridge of Cotonou.jpg|thumb|Bridge in Cotonou]]
The city has established transportation infrastructure including air, sea, river (to [[Porto Novo]]), and land routes that facilitate trade with its neighbors [[Nigeria]], [[Niger]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Togo]].

[[Coastal erosion]] has been noted for several decades. It worsened in 1961 following construction of the [[Nangbeto Dam]] and deep-water port of Cotonou. A pilot project funded by the [[United Nations Environment Program]] (UNEP) revealed that in 40 years, the coast to the east of Cotonou had retreated by 400 meters.<ref>IRIN Humanitarian News.
