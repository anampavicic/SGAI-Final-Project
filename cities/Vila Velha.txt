'''Vila Velha''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈvilɐ ˈvɛʎɐ}}; {{Literal translation|Old Village}}) is a Brazilian [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] located in the state of [[Espírito Santo]]. It lies across from [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]], the state capital. Its population was 467,722 (2022) and its area is 210.23&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="IBGE" />

==Geography==

Vila Velha forms part of the [[Greater Vitória]] metropolitan area. To the north is [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]], to the west [[Cariacica]] and [[Viana, Espírito Santo|Viana]], to the south [[Guarapari]], and to the east the [[Atlantic Ocean]].
The [[Deputy Darcy Castelo de Mendonça]] Bridge, known as [[Third Bridge]] (Portuguese: Terceira Ponte), is the second tallest bridge in Brazil, connecting and reducing the distance between the cities of Vila Velha and Vitória.

The [[Jacarenema Ecological Reserve]], a {{convert|307|ha}} conservation area established in 1997, lies along the coast to the south of the main city and contains the mangrove estuary of the [[Jucu River]].<ref>{{citation |title=Caracterização da vegetação do Manguezal na Reserva Ecológica de Jacarenema, Vila Velha, ES |last1=Silva |first1=Diego Galvagne da |last2=Gomes |first2=Juliana Lisboa |last3=Martins |first3=Marcio Lacerda Lopes |work=57º Congresso Nacional de Botânica|date=November 2006 |url=http://www.botanica.org.br/trabalhos-cientificos/57CNBot/1380.pdf|access-date=2016-06-05}}</ref>
The [[Morro do Penedo Natural Monument]] protects a granite rock mass about {{convert|132|m}} high on the coast of Vitória Bay.<ref>{{citation|language=pt|work=De Olho na Ilha

==Economy==

Notable corporations in Vila Velha include [[Garoto]], one of Brazil's largest chocolate manufacturers.

Vila Velha has been through several years of intense real estate development and several luxury buildings are now a common sight in all of its main beaches. Some critics argue that this practice can be considered excess urbanization of a previously low-profile area, despite the economic benefits.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

==History==
{{See also|History of Espírito Santo|Captaincy of Espírito Santo}}

* Vila Velha is the oldest township in Espírito Santo. It was founded as '''{{nowrap|Vila do}} {{nowrap|Espírito Santo}}''' ("Village of the [[Holy Spirit]]") on 23 May 1535 by [[Vasco Fernandes Coutinho, captain of Espírito Santo|Vasco Fernandes Coutinho]], the first captain of Espírito Santo. (The nickname "Green Shins" given to people from Vila Velha originated from the green algae that stuck to the legs of sailors returning from shore to Coutinho's ship.)<ref>{{cite book|last=Setúbal|first=José Anchieta de|title=Ecos de Vila Velha|year=2001|publisher=Prefeitura Municipal de Vila Velha|location=Vila Velha|pages=19–24|url=http://www.morrodomoreno.com.br/materias/porque-canela-verde.html|access-date=15 April 2013|language=pt}}</ref> He was forced to return to [[Portugal]] around 1550 in order to recruit new colonists, as there were not enough to sustain the colony. Upon his return, however, he discovered that there had been violent disputes between the colonists, slaves, and natives, which had forced most inhabitants to flee to the island of [[Vitória, Brazil|Vitória]]. In response, Coutinho relocated the capital to Vitória. Afterward, Vila Velha remained a quiet town until quite recently; the 1828 census, for example, showed only 1,250 people in the town. Today, however, Vila Velha is the biggest city in the entire state of Espírito Santo and has approximately 500,000 inhabitants.

*[[André Stein]] - Brazilian beach volleyball player
*[[Francielly Pereira]] — Brazilian group rhythmic gymnast
*[[Pâmella Oliveira]] - Brazilian triathlete.
