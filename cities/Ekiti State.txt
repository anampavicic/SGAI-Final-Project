'''Ekiti State''' ({{langx|yo|Ìpínlẹ̀ Èkìtì}}) is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in [[South West (Nigeria)|southwestern]] [[Nigeria]], bordered to the North by [[Kwara State]] for 61 km, to the Northeast by [[Kogi State]] for 92 km, to the South and Southeast by [[Ondo State]], and to the West by [[Osun State]] for 84 km. Named for the [[Ekiti people]]—the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] subgroup that makes up the majority of the state's population—Ekiti State was carved out from a part of [[Ondo State]] in 1996 and has its capital as the city of [[Ado-Ekiti]].<ref name="Creation">{{cite web |title=This is how the 36 states were created |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e |website=Pulse.ng |date=24 October 2017 |access-date=22 December 2021}}</ref>

Modern-day Ekiti State has been primarily inhabited for centuries by the [[Ekiti people]], a [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] subgroup, with minorities of the [[Akoko|Akoko Yoruba subgroup]]. Religiously, the majority of the state's population (~85%) are [[Christians|Christian]] with smaller [[Muslims|Muslim]] and [[Traditional African religions|traditionalist]] minorities at about 10% and 5%, respectively.

In the pre-colonial period, the area that is now Ekiti State was at various points ruled by the [[Oyo Empire]], [[Benin Empire]], and finally, the Ekiti states which formed the Ekiti Confederacy in the latter half of the 1800s. From 1877 to 1893, the Confederacy fought the [[Kiriji War]] led by Fabunmi Okemesi alongside other Eastern Yoruba groups against the [[Ibadan|Ibadan Kingdom]] and other Western Yoruba groups; the war ended in a British-brokered stalemate before the area was colonized and incorporated into the British [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] which later merged into [[British Nigeria]] in 1914. After independence in 1960, the area of now-Ekiti was a part of the post-independence [[Western Region, Nigeria|Western Region]] until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the [[Western State (Nigeria)|Western State]]. In 1976, the Western State was split and the state's east became [[Ondo State]]. Twenty years later, Ondo State's northwest (then termed the Ekiti Zone) was broken off to form Ekiti State.<ref name="Creation" />

Economically, Ekiti State is partially based on agriculture, mainly of [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[rice]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]], and [[cassava]] crops. Key minor industries are [[logging]] and [[tourism]]. Ekiti has the [[List of Nigerian states by Human Development Index#2019|joint-thirteenth highest]] [[Human Development Index]] in the country and is considered the heart of the homeland of the [[Ekiti people]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Indices |url=https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/ |website=Global Data Lab |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

Educationally, Ekiti State has the highest number of professors in Nigeria.

==History ==
Ekiti was an independent state prior to the [[United Kingdom|British]] conquest. It was one of the many [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] states in what is today [[Nigeria]]. The [[Ekiti people]] as a nation and districts of the Yoruba race trace some of her progeny to [[Oduduwa]], the father and progenitor of the Yoruba race even though good reason appears to establish the existence of aboriginal people in Ekiti region prior to the influx of royalty from present-day [[Ife|Ile Ife]] as that kingdom grew and abound.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=About Ekiti State|url=https://ekiticonnect.com/about-us/about-ekiti-state/|access-date=2021-07-12|language=en-US}}</ref>

There are two major schools of thought regarding Ekiti's history. First was the story that tied the origin of Ekiti to [[Ife]]. The story goes that the Olofin, one of the sons of [[Oduduwa]] had 16 children and in the means of searching for the new land to develop, they all journeyed out of Ile-Ife as they walked through the Iwo-Eleru (Cave of Ashes) at Isarun and had stopped over at a place called Igbo-Aka (forest of termites) closer to [[Ile Oluji/Okeigbo|Ile-Oluji]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2021-03-23|title=How The Ara People Of Ekiti Committed Mass Suicide To Avoid Enslavement|url=https://spread.ng/information/how-the-ara-people-of-ekiti-committed-mass-suicide-to-avoid-enslavement/13060/|access-date=2021-07-12|website=Spread.ng|language=en-US}}</ref>

The Olofin, the 16 children and some other beloved people continued with their journey, but when they got to a particular lovely and flat land, the Owa-Obokun (the Monarch of [[Ijesha]] land) and [[Orangun]] of Ila decided to stay in the present Ijesha and [[Igbomina]] land in [[Osun State|Osun state]].<ref name=":0" /> While the remaining 14 children journeyed onwards and later settled in the present-day Ekiti land. They discovered that there were many hills in the place and they said in their mother's language that this is "Ile olokiti" the land of hills. Therefore, the Okiti was later blended to Ekiti. So Ekiti derived her name through hills.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=TAIWO |first1=Israel |last2=ADEWOLE |first2=Lawrence |last3=FAGBEJA |first3=Mofoluso |last4=BALOGU |first4=Ifeoluwa |date=21–25 June 2021 |title=Web-Based Geospatial Information System to Access Land Suitability for Arable Crop Farming In Ekiti State, Nigeria |url=https://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig2021/papers/ts08.2/TS08.2_taiwo_adewole_et_al_11118.pdf |journal=FIG E-Working Week}}</ref>

It must however be noted, that this history may describe the history of certain royalty in present-day Ekiti, but not all of Ekiti which is made up of 131 Principal towns, with their own royalty and many land-owning communities with no royalty at all. In fact, the invading royalties from the East went on to colonize and transform the aboriginals, distinguishing the Ekiti dialect upon mix-up with the [[Ife]]/[[Oyo State|Oyo]] tongue of the Yorubas according to [[Samuel Johnson (Nigerian historian)|Samuel Johnson]], the renowned historian of the early Yoruba States and Affairs.<ref name=":1" />

The second school of thought on Ekiti's origin is more likely and grounded in actual history. It was said that [[Oduduwa]], the ancestor of the Yoruba traveled to Ife [Ife Ooyelagbo] where he met people who were already settled there. Among the elders he met in the town were Agbonniregun [Stetillu], [[Obatala]], Orelure, Obameri, Elesije, Obamirin, Obalejugbe just to mention a few. It is known that descendants of Agbonniregun [Baba Ifa] settled in Ekiti, examples being the Alara and Ajero who are sons of Ifa. [[Orunmila]] [Agbonniregun] himself spent a greater part of his life at [[Ado-Ekiti|Ado]]. Due to this, we have the saying ‘Ado ni ile Ifa’ [Ado is the home of Ifa]. The Ekiti have ever since settled in their present location.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ekitiketecanada.com/history.htm |title=Ekiti Kete - Canada |access-date=2018-02-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717221243/http://www.ekitiketecanada.com/history.htm |archive-date=2013-07-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Nobody can give accurate dates to these events due to the lack of written sources, but people have lived in Ekiti for centuries. It is on record that Ekiti Obas had a prosperous reign in the 13th century. An example was the reign of Ewi Ata of [[Ado-Ekiti]] in the 1400s. 
 
About the Ekitis, [[Samuel Johnson (Nigerian historian)|Samuel Johnson]] had this to say:

"Historically, the Ekitis are among the aboriginal elements of Nigeria absorbed by the invaders from the East (Yoruba people from Ile Ife). "The term ''Ekiti'' denotes a "Mound", and is derived from the rugged mountainous feature of that part of the country. It is an extensive province and well-watered, including several tribes and families right onto the border of the Niger, eastward. They hold themselves quite distinct from the Ijesas, especially in political affairs." (Samuel Johnson, The History of the Yoruba, 1921). It is believed that the ancestors of the Ekiti people who came to combine with the aboriginal people on the land migrated from Ile Ife, the spiritual home of the Yoruba people. According to oral and contemporary written sources of Yoruba history, [[Oduduwa]], the ancestor of the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] traveled to Ife [Ife Ooyelagbo] where he met people who were already settled there. Among the elders he met in the town were Agbonniregun [Stetillu], [[Ọbatala|Obatala]], Orelure, Obameri, Elesije, Obamirin, Obalejugbe just to mention a few. It is known that descendants of Agbonniregun [Baba Ifa] settled in Ekiti, examples being the Alara and Ajero who are sons of Ifa, Orunmila [Agbonniregun] himself spent a greater part of his life at Ado. Due to this, we have the saying ‘Ado ni ile Ifa’ [Ado is the home of Ifa]. The Ekiti have ever since settled in their present location.
The early Ekiti country is divided into 16 districts (and it has been maintained to this day), each with its own Owa or King (Owa being a generic term amongst them) of which four are supreme, viz. : —
(1) The Owore of Otun, (2) The Ajero of [[Ijero Ekiti|Ijero]], (3) The Ewi of [[Ado-Ekiti|Ado]] and (4) The Elekole of [[Ikole]].
The following are the minor Ekiti kings: —
(5) Alara of Aramoko, (6) Alaye of [[Efon-Alaiye|Efon Alaye]], (7) Ajanpanda of [[Akure]], (8) Ologotun of Ogotun, (9) Olojudo of [[Ido, Nigeria|Ido]], (10) Attah of Aiyede, (11) Oloja Oke of Igbo Odo, (12) Oloye of Oye, (13) Olomuwo of Omuwo, (14) Onire of Ire, (15) Arinjale of Ise and (16) Onitaji of Itaji.
The Orangun of Ila is sometimes classed among them, but he is only Ekiti in sympathy, being of a different family."<ref>{{Cite web|title=National Trade & International Business Center|url=http://ntibc.ng/listing/state/54/Ekiti|access-date=2021-07-12|website=ntibc.ng}}</ref>

The modern Ekiti state was formed from part of [[Ondo State|Ondo]] in 1996.<ref>Cohen, Saul B., ed. ''The Columbia Gazetteer of the World'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1998) vol 1, p. 915</ref> Prior to this, it was part of the Ondo Province in the Western Region of Nigeria. While the non-Ekiti part of the region largely dominated geographically, Akure which was then regarded as an Ekiti town was the headquarters of Ondo province.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Agitations for State Creation in Nigeria: A Study of Ekiti State|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313666270|access-date=2021-07-12|website=ResearchGate|language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:The Iworoko mountain 01.jpg|thumb|View from the top of one of The Iworoko Mountains in Ekiti State.]]
The State is mainly an upland zone, rising over 250 meters above sea level. It lies on an area underlain by [[metamorphic rock]]. It is generally an undulating part of the country with a characteristic landscape that consists of old plains broken by step-sided out-crops that may occur singularly or in groups or ridges.
Such rocks out-crops exist mainly at Aramoko, [[Efon-Alaiye]], [[Ikere-Ekiti]], Igbara-odo- ekiti and [[Okemesi|Okemesi-Ekiti]]. The State is dotted with rugged hills, notable ones being [[Ikere-Ekiti]] Hills in the south, Efon-Alaiye Hills on the western boundary and [[Ado-Ekiti]] Hills in the centre.<ref>{{Cite web|title=For The Love Of Ekiti|url=https://www.facebook.com/ololufeekiti/posts/1681005171971984 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/iarchive/facebook/763313467074497/1681005171971984 |archive-date=2022-02-26 |url-access=limited|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2020-05-24}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

===Climate and vegetation===
The State enjoys a tropical climate with two distinct seasons. These are the [[rainy season]] (April–October) and the [[dry season]] (November–March). Temperature ranges between 21° and 28&nbsp;°C with high humidity. The southwesterly wind and the northeast trade winds blow in the rainy and dry ([[Harmattan]]) seasons respectively. [[Tropical forest]] exists in the south, while [[savannah]] occupies the northern peripheries.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ADO EKITI, NIGERIA|url=https://www.cfan.org.uk/campaigns/ado-ekiti-nigeria|date=2019-11-19|website=[[Christ for all Nations]]|language=en|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref>

===Proposed 18 Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) in Ekiti State===
The Ekiti State Government in 2014, prior to the exit of the immediate past Governor [[Kayode Fayemi|Fayemi]], was to create an additional 18 LCDAs based on the recommendations of the White Paper Committee set up by the government. This has, however, been cancelled by Governor [[Ayo Fayose]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

==Demographics==
Ekitis are culturally homogeneous and they speak a dialect of Yoruba language known as ''Ekiti''. The homogeneous nature of Ekiti confers on the state some uniqueness among the states of the federation. Slight differences are noticeable in the Ekiti dialects of the [[Yoruba language]] spoken by the border communities to other states. For example, the people of Ado local government area do not speak exactly the same dialect as the people of Ijero Local government area, while the people of Ikole area speak something different from the people of Ikere area. The communities influenced by their locations include Otun (Moba land) which speaks a dialect close to the one spoken by the Igbominas in [[Kwara State]]. The people of Oke-Ako, Irele, Omuo speak a similar [[dialect]] to that of Ijesas of [[Osun State]].{{fact|date=May 2024}}

Unarguably, Ekiti, as an ethnic group, has the highest number of professors in Nigeria. “Ekiti Land has been a “beacon and source of living academic water to the black race...History had it that Ekiti produced six medical doctors who operated in ships between 1500 and 1830... before the first school was established in Nigeria (Ilesanmi, Dele Alaba, 2023).

The Capital of the State is Ado-Ekiti.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oguntola |first=Tunde |date=2022-09-27 |title=2023: Next President, Govs Must Get Two-thirds Spread, Says INEC |url=https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |access-date=2023-02-24 |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Electoral system ===
The electoral system of each state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive the plurality of the vote and over 25% of the vote in at least two-thirds of the state local government areas. If no candidate passes the threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government Areas.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oguntola |first=Tunde |date=2022-09-27 |title=2023: Next President, Govs Must Get Two-thirds Spread, Says INEC |url=https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |access-date=2023-02-24 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Natural resources==
Ekiti land is naturally endowed with numerous natural resources. The state is potentially rich in mineral deposits. These include [[granite]], [[kaolinite]], [[columbite]], charnockite, [[iron ore]], [[baryte]], [[limestone]], [[Aquamarine (gem)|aquamarine]], [[gemstone]], [[phosphate]], [[limestone]], [[tourmaline]], gold coal in limited quantity among others. They are largely deposited in different towns and villages of Ijero, Ekiti West, Ado-Ekiti, Ikole, Ikere, Ise-Ekiti and other local government areas.

The Land is also blessed with water resources, some of its major rivers are Ero, [[Osun river|Osun]], Ose, and Ogbese. The state of hills is also blessed with a variety of tourist attractions abound in the state namely, [[Ikogosi Warm Springs]]; Arinta Water Falls; Olosunta and Orole hills of Ikere; Erin-ayonugba River at Erijiyan Ekiti; Fajuyi Memorial Park of Ado - Ekiti and so on. The Ikogosi tourist centre is the most popular and the most developed. The warm spring is a unique natural feature, and supporting facilities are developed in the centre. The spring is at present, being processed and packaged into bottled water for commercial purposes by a private company - [[United African Company of Nigeria|UAC Nigeria]].

Moreover, the land is buoyant in agricultural resources with [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]] as its leading [[cash crop]]. It was largely known that Ekiti land constituted well over 40% of the cocoa products of the famous old Western Region. The land is also known for its forest resources, notably [[timber]], and in March 2022, Obeche ([[Triplochiton scleroxylon]]) was adopted as a State Tree due to its prominence and economic significance.<ref name="thehopenewspaper.com"/> Because of the favourable climatic conditions, the land enjoys luxuriant vegetation, thus, it has abundant resources of different species of timber. Food crops such as [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[cassava]], and also [[grain]]s like [[rice]] and [[maize]] are grown in large quantities. Other notable crops such as [[kola nut]] and varieties of fruits are also cultivated in commercial quantities.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ekiti state nigeria granite|url=https://www.isf-lecce.it/equipment/239836/ekiti-state-nigeria-granite/1560226005.html|website=www.isf-lecce.it|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref>
