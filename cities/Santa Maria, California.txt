==History==
{{Main|History of Santa Maria, California}}
[[File:Juan_Pacífico_Ontiveros.png|thumb|left|upright|Santa Maria was named by noted [[Californio]] ranchero Juan Pacífico Ontiveros.]]
[[File:11 Ethel Pope Aud front (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|upright|Ethel Pope Auditorium]]
[[File:Architect and engineer (1934) (14578059319).jpg|thumb|upright|left|City Hall, 1934]]
The Santa Maria Valley, stretching from the [[Santa Lucia Mountains]] toward the [[Pacific Ocean]], was the homeland of the [[Chumash people]] for several thousand years. The [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] made their homes on the slopes of the surrounding hills among the [[Quercus agrifolia|oak]]s, on the banks of the Santa Maria River among the [[Platanus racemosa|sycamore]]s, and along the coast. They had unique plank-built boats, called [[Tomol]], which they used for ocean fishing.

In 1769, the [[Gaspar de Portolá|Portolá Expedition]] passed through the Santa Maria Valley during the first [[Spanish people|Spanish]] land exploration up the coast of [[Las Californias]] Province. [[Mission San Luis Obispo de Tolosa]] was established just north of the valley in 1772, and [[Mission La Purísima Concepción]] was established near present-day [[Lompoc]] in 1787. Rather than rich soil, white settlers were attracted here by the possibility of free land. In 1821, after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], the mission lands in Santa Maria Valley were made available for private ownership under a [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]] called [[Rancho Punta de Laguna]]. At the end of the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican War]] in 1848, California [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|was ceded]] to the United States, and was granted statehood with the [[Compromise of 1850]].

In the late 19th century, the area's rich soil attracted farmers and other settlers. By the end of the century, the Santa Maria River Valley had become one of the most productive agricultural areas in the state. Agriculture remains a key component of the economy for the city and the entire region.<ref name=ci.santa-maria.ca.us>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.santa-maria.ca.us/history.html|title=A Bit About the History of the City of Santa Maria|access-date=July 14, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105113623/http://www.ci.santa-maria.ca.us/history.html |archive-date=November 5, 2012 }}</ref>

Between 1869 and 1874, four of the valley's settlers, Rudolph Cook, John Thornburg, Isaac Fesler (for whom Fesler Jr. High School is named), and Isaac Miller (for whom Miller Elementary School is named), built their homes near each other at the present corners on Broadway and Main Street. The townsite was recorded in Santa Barbara in 1875. The new town was named Grangerville, then changed to Central City. It became Santa Maria on February 18, 1885, since mail was often being sent by mistake to [[Central City, Colorado]]. Santa Maria was chosen from the name Juan Pacifico Ontiveros had given to his property 25 years earlier.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}} Streets named after the four settlers now form a 6-block square centered at Broadway and Main Street, the center of town.

[[Oil exploration]] began in 1888, leading to large-scale discoveries at the turn of the 20th century. In 1902, [[Union Oil]] discovered the large [[Orcutt Oil Field]] in the [[Solomon Hills]] south of town, and a number of smaller companies also began pumping oil. Two years later, Union Oil had 22 wells in production. Other significant discoveries followed, including the [[Lompoc Oil Field]] in 1903 and the [[Cat Canyon Oil Field|Cat Canyon field]] in 1908. Over the next 80 years more large oil fields were found, and thousands of oil wells drilled and put into production.<ref>{{cite web|last=Martellotti|first=Patricia|date=September 8, 2021|title=Santa Maria Cemetery: Crews discover oil well abandoned in 1929|url=https://keyt.com/news/2021/09/08/santa-maria-cemetery-crews-discover-oil-well-abandoned-in-1929/|access-date=September 9, 2021|website=NewsChannel 3-12|language=en-US}}</ref> Oil development intensified in the 1930s, with the discovery of the Santa Maria Valley Oil Field in 1934,<ref name="2008rpt">{{cite web | title = 2008 Report of the state oil & gas supervisor | work = Department of Oil, Gas, and Geothermal Resources | publisher = California Department of Conservation | year = 2009 | url = ftp://ftp.consrv.ca.gov/pub/oil/annual_reports/2008/PR06_Annual_2008.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170525054948/ftp://ftp.consrv.ca.gov/pub/oil/annual_reports/2008/PR06_Annual_2008.pdf | url-status = dead | archive-date = May 25, 2017 | access-date = January 3, 2010 }} p. 63</ref> right underneath the southern and western parts of the city of Santa Maria, which spurred the city's growth even further. By 1957 there were 1,775 oil wells in operation in the [[Santa Maria Valley]], producing more than $640 million worth of oil.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|22.4|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|22.8|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.6|sqmi|km2}} of it (2.73%) is water.

Santa Maria is situated north of the unincorporated community of [[Orcutt, California]], and south of the [[Santa Maria River (California)|Santa Maria River]] (which serves as the line between [[Santa Barbara County]] and [[San Luis Obispo County]]). The valley is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]] and to the east by the [[San Rafael Mountains]] and the [[Los Padres National Forest]]. The city of [[Guadalupe, California]] is approximately {{convert|9|mi|km}} to the west of Santa Maria.

===Climate===
Santa Maria experiences a cool [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csb'') typical of coastal areas of California north of Point Conception. The climate is mostly sunny, refreshed by the ocean breeze. Fog is common. Snow in the mountains is seen during the winter. In the lowest parts of the city it is virtually unknown; with the last brief flurry recorded in January 1949. The only recorded earlier snowfall was in January 1882. Rainfall averages {{convert|13.32|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} annually; however as is typical for the region it is very variable, with actual falls ranging from just {{convert|4.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} in the “rain year” from July 1971 to June 1972, to {{convert|32.56|in|mm|abbr=on}} between July 1997 and June 1998. The wettest month on record has been January 1995 with {{convert|11.78|in|mm|abbr=on}} , and the wettest day February 10, 1938, when {{convert|3.55|in|mm|abbr=on}} fell in 24 hours. The record high temperature of {{convert|110|°F|°C|1}} was observed on June 20, 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/weather/weather-watch/article244520097.html|title=SLO County could see a heat wave in August. Could it break local records?|author=Lindsey, John|newspaper=[[The Tribune (San Luis Obispo)|The Tribune]]|date=July 27, 2020|accessdate=February 11, 2022}}</ref> while the record low of {{convert|20|°F|°C|1}} was observed twice: on January 2, 1976, and December 7, 1978.

[[File:Lewellen Justice Center (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Lewellen Justice Center]] [[Agriculture]] plays an important role in the city's economy. The Santa Maria area is home to an increasing number of [[vineyards]], [[wineries]] and [[winemakers]] and is centrally located to both the [[Santa Ynez]] and Foxen Canyon areas of Santa Barbara County's wine country, and San Luis Obispo County's [[Edna Valley]]-[[Arroyo Grande]] wine country.

The agricultural areas surrounding the city are some of the most productive in California, with primary crops including [[strawberries]], [[wine grapes]], [[celery]], [[lettuce]], [[peas]], [[Squash (plant)|squash]], [[cauliflower]], [[spinach]], [[broccoli]] and [[beans]]. Many [[cattle]] ranchers also call the Santa Maria Valley home.

===Tri-Tip and Santa Maria-style barbecue===
[[File:Tri-tip, baked beans and toast.jpg|thumb|[[Tri-tip]] on the grill, with a saucepan of beans and loaves of sourdough bread]]
{{main|Santa Maria-style barbecue}}
Santa Maria-style barbecue is a regional culinary tradition rooted in the Santa Maria Valley. The [[tri-tip]] steak has its roots in Santa Maria.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} Tri-tip is a cut of beef from the [[bottom sirloin]]. It is a small triangular muscle, usually {{convert|1.5|to|2.5|lb|g|abbr=on}} per side of beef. In the United States, this cut was typically used for [[ground beef]] or sliced into steaks until the late 1950s, when it became a local specialty in Santa Maria. "Santa Maria-style" barbecue is usually used in reference to the seasoning of tri-tip or other meats (most notably [[top sirloin]], or "top block") when rubbed with salt, pepper, and spices and cooked whole on a [[rotisserie]] or grilled over local [[Erythrobalanus|red oak]] wood. The side dishes complementing a typical "Santa Maria-style" barbecue generally consist of [[garlic bread]], [[Common bean#Pink beans|pinquito beans]], and a [[salad]].

Sunset Magazine's August 2013 issue features a 10-page spread on Santa Maria Style BBQ, crowning Santa Maria as "The West's Best BBQ Town".<ref name="santamariavalleybbq1">{{cite news |url=https://santamariavalley.com/sunsets-epic-feature-on-santa-maria-bbq/|title=Sunset's Epic Feature on Santa Maria BBQ|work=santamariavalley.com|date=July 25, 2013|access-date=July 14, 2017}}</ref>

===Wine===
{{Main|Santa Maria Valley AVA}}

Santa Maria, along with the neighboring [[Lompoc, California|Lompoc]], [[Los Alamos, California|Los Alamos]] and [[Santa Ynez Valley]]s, combine to create one of the nation's largest wine-producing regions, referred to as the Santa Barbara Wine Country.

The often foggy and windswept Santa Maria Valley is the northernmost appellation in [[Santa Barbara County]]. The region's first officially approved [[American Viticultural Area]] (AVA) enjoys extremely complex soil conditions and diverse microclimates. [[Chardonnay]] and [[Pinot noir]] are two varietals which especially benefit from the ocean's influence, and are the flagship wines of this appellation.

Santa Maria Valley grapes are also used by wineries throughout [[Santa Barbara County]] and at many wineries outside of the county. The Santa Maria Valley name is used on labels from wineries that are based far away from the Santa Barbara County sunshine. The Santa Maria Valley appellation is bounded by the [[San Rafael Mountains]] and the [[Los Padres National Forest]] to the east, and by the Solomon Hills and the city of Santa Maria to the west.

===Theatre===
Santa Maria's [[Allan Hancock College]] is the home of The [[Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts]] (PCPA), a theatrical school and production company.

==Government==
[[File:NAACP George Floyd protest in Santa Maria, California - 2020-06-06.jpg|thumb|right|Santa Maria City Hall]]
Santa Maria's government is split down the middle of the [[political spectrum]], in contrast to Santa Barbara, which tends to be more liberal. Due in part to this political division, plus irrigation and water-supply issues, many attempts have been made to divide the county, the northern portion from [[Point Conception]] upwards to become Mission County. Thus far the movement has been unsuccessful.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://sbcvote.com/elect/resources/results6_2006/results-1.htm|title=Direct Primary Election June 6, 2006 Certified Results|work=sbcvote.com|date=June 29, 2006|access-date=July 14, 2017}}</ref> Santa Maria is a reliably [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] stronghold, having voted for the Democratic candidate for the past six elections, {{as of |2020|lc=y}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bestplaces.net/voting/city/california/santa_maria |title=Politics & Voting in Santa Maria, California |access-date=June 30, 2021 |archive-date=June 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210630202357/https://www.bestplaces.net/voting/city/california/santa_maria |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Roads====
[[File:CA 135 northern terminus.jpg|thumb|Route 135 as Broadway in Santa Maria near its northern terminus, looking southbound, June 2014]]
[[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]] runs through the middle of the [[Santa Maria Valley]] and is the main [[Limited-access road|freeway]] connecting many West Coast cities. It has been improved to freeway status (meaning all at-grade intersections have been eliminated) within the city of Santa Maria itself. A $32 million widening project that expanded the freeway from four to six lanes between Santa Maria Way and the Highway 166 exit was completed by early 2009.

[[California State Route 1|State Route 1]] runs around the western edge of the city and connects it to nearby [[Vandenberg Space Force Base]] near [[Lompoc, California|Lompoc]]. The section of US 101 in the city is a freeway, and a small part of a nearby section of Highway 1 that runs between the city and the base is also a freeway, but the two freeway segments do not directly connect to each other.

[[California State Route 135|State Route 135]] is considered to be the major artery through the city. It comes from [[Los Alamos, California|Los Alamos]], a town to the south of Santa Maria, and it enters Orcutt and Santa Maria as an expressway. The expressway runs all the way to Santa Maria Way. Highway 135 then turns into Broadway and runs through the heart of the city and all the way up to the Santa Maria River and U.S. 101.

====Rail====
The [[Santa Maria Valley Railroad]] (SMVRR) is a shortline freight [[railroad]] to [[Guadalupe, California|Guadalupe]] where the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] Interchange point is. Main business includes storage of railroad cars when northern California and southern California storage area are full. In the 1990s, the city proposed a [[light rail]] service to replace the SMV's right-of-way, as its future was uncertain.
