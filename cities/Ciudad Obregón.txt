'''Ciudad Obregón''' is a city in southern [[Sonora]]. It is the state's second largest city after [[Hermosillo]] and serves as the municipal seat of [[Cajeme]]. As of 2020, the city has a population of 436,484. Ciudad Obregón is {{convert|530|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the [[U.S.–Mexico border|state's northern border]].

== History ==
The city, previously named Cajeme, takes its name from [[Mexican Revolution]]ary [[Álvaro Obregón]], a native of nearby [[Huatabampo, Sonora]]. Álvaro Obregón became [[president of Mexico]] after the Revolution and initiated an "agricultural revolution" in the Yaqui Valley, introducing modern agricultural techniques and making this valley one of the most prosperous agricultural regions in the country. Renowned US agronomist [[Norman Borlaug]], the architect of the "[[Green Revolution]]" worked here after successful developments in increasing the resistance of wheat. For his efforts he was later awarded the Nobel Prize.
The origins of this city date back to the year 1906 when the company's rail track [[South Pacific Railway]] reached this area of the [[Yaqui River|Yaqui Valley]]; this route, made it possible to incorporate with the [[Mayo River (Mexico)|Mayo Valley]] to the domestic and external market, attracting a wave of investors and settlers who brought out populations.

In 1907, a flag station was established for the locomotive crossing the state to supply water, this station was called Cajeme. [[Cajemé]] was a Yaqui leader (whose population lives in this area) who fought against them as part of the Porfyrian army; and then led the Yaqui rebellion against it [[Porfirio Díaz]].

"The Cajeme station was run by the American Bert Cameron, superintendent, and Emilio Estrella, station manager. They and their families were the first settlers. Soon after, the cowboys arrived to guard the corrals of cattle that from here was sent to other regions. Soon came neighbors of [[Hope]], near the fields cultivated in the Valley."{{cn|date=July 2022}} The Yaquis offered resistance to the arrival of the first settlers on their lands.

The first neighborhood was called ''Plano Oriente''. In 1923, 'Cajeme Motors' was installed, owned by American James Huffaker, it was the first auto agency; fact that contributed significantly to the development of Cajeme. At the end of his term as president of the country (1920–1924), the General [[Alvaro Obregón]] returned to Sonora and carried out business projects in [[Navojoa]] and Cajeme, creating in 1925, the company 'Obregón y Cía.', which provided more work and economic development in the Region.
On 29 November 1927, Cajeme was declared the head of the municipality (until then it had been part of [[Cocorit]]) by the governor [[Fausto Topete]], and in 1928 year in which the first [[town hall]] was installed, it was decreed on 28 July of the same year on 28 July of the same year change of name to Ciudad Obregón in recognition of [[Alvaro Obregón]], while the name of the municipality was preserved. That same year the first printing press was installed and it was where the first news weekly called 'The Pacific Gazette', owned by Lithuanian immigrant Leo Rosenfeld and his wife Virginia Gámez, was printed.

The first neighborhoods were Plano Oriente, Ladrillera, Cumuripa, Hidalgo, Constitución, El Castillo, Quinta Díaz, Bella Vista and Colonia del Valle.

Rice was the most important crop in the Yaqui Valley in the early [twentieth century]; other crops also include wheat, beans, chickpeas, various vegetables and alfalfa. Over the course of the century, wheat became the most important crop. Due to Cajeme's agricultural vocation, the first industry of great importance was rice mills.

In the 1950s the agronomist [[Norman E. Borlaug]] (called the Father of the Green Revolution) collaborated with the creation of the Northwest Agricultural Research Center (CIANO) and in 1970 received the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in research developing better varieties of wheat and maize.Then "El Valle Del Yaqui" was called,"The Barn Of Mexico."

At the end of the twentieth century the railway disappeared as a means of transport for passengers and the station was abandoned.

For the development of productive activities, local commerce offers everything from re-shareholders, agricultural implement stores, [[agribusiness]] machinery, safety equipment and all kinds of inputs for production. There are two markets for supplies.

For the realization of economic activities and service to the general public, Ciudad Obregón has offices of the main financial institutions of the country.<ref name="auto">[http://visitaobregon.gob.mx/tourism/city-obregon/ City Obregón] visitaobregon.gob.mx</ref>

== City origins ==
Cajeme Municipality has as its head Ciudad Obregón. Its first settlers established themselves in the neighborhood called Plano Oriente, as irrigation canals made by the Richardson company around 1910 and two years later, the South Pacific railroad established a station called Cajeme. The town of Cajeme was initially a part of Cocorit Municipality until its elevation to Municipal Seat on 28 September 1927. The first city government was established on 1 January 1928. The 28 July 1928 decree stated that "the city is known now with the name of Ciudad Obregón, the town formerly known as Cajeme." In 1937 another legislation stated that Cajeme be the name of the Municipality and Ciudad Obregón its seat.

In 1950 Ciudad Obregon had a population on 120,000.<ref>Columbia-Lippincott Gazetteer. (New York: Columbia University Press, 1952) p. 406</ref>

== Roots and traditions ==
The native [[Yaqui]] people are settled in eight towns, Potam, {{ill|Huiribis|es}}, Torim, Cocorit, Bacum, Vicam, Rahum and Belem. {{convert|7|km|mi|spell=In|abbr=off}} from the city is the first of the eight Yaqui towns that make the autonomous territory of these people known for their independent character, because it is one of the few American ethnic groups not dominated militarily by Spanish colonialists.

Yaqui history informs the defense of their territory and culture, an ancestral culture enriched by rites and traditions of which the Deer Dance stands out, a symbolic representation of the hunt for this animal.

== Demographics ==
Ciudad Obregón is the second largest city in [[Sonora]] (''after state capital [[Hermosillo]]'') with a 2010 census population of 298,625 People.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/son/poblacion/default.aspx?tema=me&e=26|access-date=7 February 2013|title=Census Data}}</ref> Its municipality of Cajeme had a population of 409,310.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www3.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/mexicocifras/default.aspx?e=26 |title=México en Cifras |access-date=7 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004220047/http://www3.inegi.org.mx/sistemas/mexicocifras/default.aspx?e=26#C |archive-date=4 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

{{As of|2005}} the per capita income for the municipality of Cajeme was $10,940 and the [[Human Development Index]] was 0.8635.<ref>{{cite web|author=Oficina Nacional de Desarrollo Humano|title=''IDH Municipal 2000–2005 base de datos''|year=2005|access-date=17 December 2008|url=http://www.undp.org.mx/DesarrolloHumano/competividad/images/IDH%20municipal%202000-2005%20base%20de%20datos.xls|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306161046/http://www.undp.org.mx/DesarrolloHumano/competividad/images/IDH%20municipal%202000-2005%20base%20de%20datos.xls|archive-date=6 March 2009}}</ref>

==Government and economy==
In Ciudad Obregón lies the seat of the municipal government of Cajeme. The government's exercise rests with the Municipal President and his cabinet, elected every three years.

Of the twenty-one [[Congress of the State of Sonora,' Electoral Districts of the State of Sonora, the state electoral districts of Sonora]], three correspond to the city. The municipality of Cajeme has its own federal electoral district, the [[VI Federal Electoral District of Sonora]] of the [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|Chamber of Deputies]] of the [[Union Congress (Mexico)|Congress of the Union of Mexico]].

The main economic activities in the entity are maquiladora, agriculture, livestock, [aquaculture], and trade. However, the fertile lands of the municipality favour agriculture and the services derived from it, such as its suppliers and their transport. Real estate and construction development has also had a major boom in the city that, because of its relatively recent foundation, has been able to be planned with wide avenues and modern urban development compared to other Sonorense cities.

According to the national census prepared by the [[INEGI]], the economically active population (PEA) in 2010 corresponds to 54.1% of the inhabitants of the municipality of whom 95% have an occupation.<ref>[http://visitaobregon.gob.mx/tourism/city-obregon/#gobierno-y-econom%C3%ADa Economy] visitaobregon.gob.mx</ref>
