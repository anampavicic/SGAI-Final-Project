'''Navi Mumbai''' ({{IPA-mr|nəʋiː mumbəi|lang}}; previously '''New Bombay''') is a planned city next to [[Mumbai]], located in the [[Konkan division]] of the western Indian state of [[Maharashtra]], on the mainland of [[India]]. Navi Mumbai is situated across two districts, [[Thane district|Thane]] & [[Raigad district|Raigad]]. It is a part of the [[Mumbai Metropolitan Area]]. 

The area within the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation has been ranked third among 73 cities surveyed for cleanliness and hygiene by the [[Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs|Union Ministry of Urban Development]] and [[Quality Council of India]] as a part of [[Swachh Bharat Abhiyan]] and is being modified with various projects and formation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/mbErel.aspx?relid=136427|title=Swachh Survekshan −2016 – ranks of 73 cities|website=pib.nic.in|access-date=10 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220130401/http://pib.nic.in/newsite/mbErel.aspx?relid=136427|archive-date=20 February 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Navi Mumbai is home to various educational institutions. Various [[multinational corporation]]s have their head offices/branches across the city, making it an active business hub. Navi Mumbai also has [[Recreation|recreational]] facilities such as a golf course, [[Central Park, Kharghar|Central Park]] and [[Pandavkada Falls|Pandavkada Water Falls]] in [[Kharghar]]. [[Thane–Belapur Road|Thane Belapur Marg]] and [[Palm Beach Marg]] are major business attraction and upmarket residential areas.

==History==
In the late 1500s, [[Janjira State|Siddis of Janjira]] built the [[Belapur Fort|Belapur Killa]] located atop a small hill near the mouth of the Panvel Creek. In 1682, the fort was captured by the Portuguese, who had managed to annex the regions controlled by the Siddis.

In 1733, the [[Maratha Empire|Marathas]], led by [[Chimaji Appa]], wrested control of the fort from the Portuguese. Appa had made a vow that if it were to be successfully recaptured from the [[Portuguese India|Portuguese]], he would place a garland of ''beli'' leaves in a nearby Amruthaishwar temple, and after the victory the fort was christened as Belapur Fort. The Marathas ruled the area until 23 June 1817, when it was captured by Captain Charles Gray of the [[East India Company|British East India Company]]. The British partially destroyed the fort under their policy of razing any Maratha stronghold in the area.

The population of [[Mumbai|Greater Mumbai]] doubled from three to nearly six million between 1951 and 1971. The population growth led to deteriorating quality of life for many in the city.  

The Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act was passed in 1966, and the [[Mumbai Metropolitan Region|Bombay Metropolitan Region]] was created in June 1967 and finalized in 1970. The plan called for development of a twin city across the harbour, on the mainland to the east. 

The Board recommended that the new metro-centre or Navi Mumbai as it is now called, be developed to accommodate a population of 2.1 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidco.maharashtra.gov.in/NM_Evolution_NewBombay.aspx|title=CIDCO :: Evolution of Navi Mumbai|website=Cidco.maharashtra.gov.in|access-date=10 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810171642/http://www.cidco.maharashtra.gov.in/NM_Evolution_NewBombay.aspx|archive-date=10 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

CIDCO planned and constructed railway stations, roads and public spaces in Navi Mumbai and developed nearby areas commercially. In 1973, the [[Vashi]] bridge was opened to the public for residents of [[Vashi]], [[CBD Belapur]] and [[Nerul]]. The Sion-Panvel Highway was built to reduce the time taken to travel from Sion to Panvel. Major changes took place only after 1990, with the commissioning of a wholesale agricultural produce market at Turbhe and the construction of a commuter railway line from Mankhurd to Vashi in May 1992. These developments caused a sudden growth in economic activities and population in Navi Mumbai.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History |url=https://www.nmmc.gov.in/navimumbai/history1540201195 |access-date=2024-09-22 |website=www.nmmc.gov.in/}}</ref>

Southern Navi Mumbai is being developed rapidly with its class infrastructure and modern nodes of [[Kharghar]], [[Kamothe]], [[Panvel]] and [[Kalamboli]]. These nodes are experiencing major [[Infrastructure|infrastructural]] developments due to their proximity to the proposed Navi Mumbai International Airport. Also, the latest development known as 'One Time Planning' with an estimated budget of ₹12,821 crores is underway to transform the municipalized Navi Mumbai on the lines of the megacities of the world.

Two additional municipal bodies were created, [[Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation|Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC)]] in the North and [[Panvel Municipal Corporation]] in the South. Each area is divided into smaller groups called sectors.

CIDCO initially developed areas like Juhu Nagar (Vashi), Nerul, and CBD Belapur with homes, schools, and roads. Later, due to a growing population with the railway extension in the 1990s, CIDCO shifted focus to Kharghar, Kamothe, New Panvel and Kopar Khairane. Private builders played a large role in developing these areas. CIDCO, as of 2015, runs newer areas in South Navi Mumbai.<ref>{{citation |title=CIDCO announces Rs 34,000-crore smart city project |date=3 December 2015 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/business/cidco-announces-rs-34000crore-smart-city-project/article7943833.ece |work=[[The Hindu]] |access-date=20 December 2015 |location=Mumbai |archive-date=24 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124152519/https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/business/cidco-announces-rs-34000crore-smart-city-project/article7943833.ece |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{citation |author=BS Reporter |title=Cidco launches Navi Mumbai smart city project |date=5 December 2015 |url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/cidco-launches-navi-mumbai-smart-city-project-115120400839_1.html |newspaper=Business Standard India  |access-date=20 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222124736/http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/cidco-launches-navi-mumbai-smart-city-project-115120400839_1.html |url-status=live |location=Mumbai |publisher=[[Business Standard]] |archive-date=22 December 2015}}</ref>

===Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation===

On 17 December 1991, [[Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation]] (NMMC) was constituted by the state government for maintaining some of the developed nodes of Navi Mumbai.

Local self-government started on 1 January 1992. NMMC was handed seven of the 14 nodes of the Navi Mumbai project area for its jurisdiction. However, [[CIDCO]], as a planning authority, has rights on the open plots in these seven nodes.

The NMMC jurisdiction starts at Digha Gaon in the North and ends at Belapur in the South.<ref name="NMMC_Ward">{{cite web |title=Zoning |website=NMMC |url=https://www.nmmc.gov.in/zoning |access-date=12 March 2021 |archive-date=2 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211002154213/https://www.nmmc.gov.in/zoning |url-status=live }}</ref> The NMMC area is planned into seven nodes (zones) - [[CBD Belapur|Belapur]], [[Nerul]], [[Sanpada]], [[Vashi]], [[Kopar Khairane]], [[Ghansoli]] and [[Airoli]].

Each of the nodes is self-sufficient in terms of providing quality education. Students are given access to various syllabi, including the State Education Board, CBSE, IGCSE, IB and ICSE patterns. Other than these, CIDCO encouraged private institutions as well.

About 22.5% of the total population is considered to be school-going children. Most students attend school and college within their node (township). 76% of the students walk to their school or college, 12% use public transport, 10% use bicycles and only 2% travel by school bus.

A number of premier schools and colleges have been set up in Navi Mumbai. Even beyond local students, students from Mumbai and even outside come to Navi Mumbai in their quest for quality education. As such, Navi Mumbai is quickly acquiring the title of educational hub.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cidco.maharashtra.gov.in/NM_Educational_Infrastructure.aspx|title=CIDCO :: Educational Infrastructure|website=Cidco.maharashtra.gov.in|access-date=10 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170810171259/http://www.cidco.maharashtra.gov.in/NM_Educational_Infrastructure.aspx|archive-date=10 August 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Some of these premium institutions have been listed below.
