'''Modesto''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|d|ɛ|s|t|oʊ}}; {{IPA|es|moˈðesto}}) is the [[county seat]] and largest city of [[Stanislaus County, California]], United States. With a population of 218,069 according to 2022 [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] estimates,<ref>{{Cite web |title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Modesto, California |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/modestocitycalifornia/PST045222 |access-date=November 23, 2023 |website=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref> it is the [[List of cities and towns in California|19th-most populous city in California]].

Modesto is located in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] [[List of regions of California|region]], {{Convert|68|mi}} south of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and {{Convert|90|mi}} north of [[Fresno, California|Fresno]].  Distances from other places include: {{Convert|40|mi}} north of [[Merced, California]], {{Convert|92|mi}} east of [[San Francisco]], {{Convert|66|mi}} west of [[Yosemite National Park]], and {{Convert|24|mi}} south of [[Stockton, California|Stockton]].

The city, in the [[San Joaquin Valley]], is surrounded by rich farmland. Stanislaus County ranks sixth among California counties in farm production.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbf.com/counties/?id=50|title=CA Farm Bureau – County Farm Bureaus|website=cfbf.com|access-date=August 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919170700/http://cfbf.com/counties/?id=50|archive-date=September 19, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> It is home to [[E & J Gallo Winery|Gallo Family Winery]], the largest [[Family business|family-owned]] winery in the [[United States]].<ref name="manufacturer">{{cite web | title= Gallo Glass Company: Top of the glass | first= Ruari | last= McCallion | work= The Manufacturer | url= http://www.themanufacturer.com/us/profile/4124/ | access-date= December 31, 2009 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110610231846/http://www.themanufacturer.com/us/profile/4124/ | archive-date= June 10, 2011 | url-status= dead}}</ref>
Led by milk, almonds, chickens, walnuts, and corn silage, the county grossed nearly $3.1&nbsp;billion in agricultural production in 2011.<ref>{{Cite web |title=City of Modesto |url=https://technologymagazine.com/company/city-of-modesto |access-date=November 23, 2023 |website=technologymagazine.com |language=en}}</ref> The [[farm-to-table]] movement plays a central role in Modesto living in the Central Valley.

Modesto has been often honored as a [[Tree City USA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.modesto.ca.us/newsroom/releases/city/prdetail.asp?id=100|title=City of Modesto – Newsroom – Press Releases|author=City of Modesto IT|work=modesto.ca.us|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229205421/http://www.ci.modesto.ca.us/newsroom/releases/city/prdetail.asp?id=100|archive-date=February 29, 2012}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:10th Street, Modesto, California, circa 1875.jpg|thumb|Modesto's 10th Street {{Circa|1890}}]]
[[File:California - Modesto - NARA - 23934545.jpg|thumb|right|Modesto in 1943]]
The City of Modesto was originally a stop on the railroad connecting [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] to [[Los Angeles]], built by [[Central Pacific Railroad]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.modestogov.com/DocumentCenter/View/6337/History-of-Modesto-PDF?bidId=|title=History of Modesto|publisher=City of Modesto|access-date=March 16, 2021}}</ref> When Modesto was founded in 1870, the railroad company co-founder [[Mark Hopkins Jr.]] suggested to name it after his associate the banker [[William C. Ralston]]. Ralston asked that another name be found, and a railroad employee exclaimed loudly in Spanish that Ralston was a modest man. The railroad company co-founder [[Charles Crocker]] then named the town Modesto in recognition of Ralston's modesty.<ref>{{cite web |title=Greening of Paradise Valley - The First 100 Years of the Modesto Irrigation District |publisher=Modesto Irrigation District  |pages=2–3 |url=https://www.mid.org/about/history/grnng_of_pvy-02.pdf}}</ref>

Modesto's population exceeded 1,000 residents in 1884. With fields of grain, the nearby [[Tuolumne River]] for grain barges, and railroad traffic, the town grew. Irrigation water came from dams in the foothills, and irrigated fields of vegetables and fruit and nut trees flourished. By 1900, Modesto's population was more than 4,500. During [[World War II]], the area provided canned goods, powdered milk, and eggs for the US [[United States Armed Forces|armed forces]] and Allied forces. For the next few decades, Modesto's population grew about two percent per year, to over 100,000 in 1980 and over 200,000 in 2001.

The city's official motto, "Water Wealth Contentment Health," is emblazoned on the downtown [[Modesto Arch]], which is featured in local photographs and postcards. The motto was selected in a contest held in 1911, with a $3 prize for the winner. (The original winning motto, "Nobody's [[:wikt:get someone's goat|got Modesto's goat]]",<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoover |first=Mildred Brooke|title=Historic Spots in California |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYMPR6xAj50C&pg=PA521 |year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-7817-6|page=521}}</ref> was later declined by town officials.) Modesto's motto is sometimes spoofed as "The land gets the water, the bankers get the wealth, the cows get contentment, and the farmers get the health."<ref name=Baggese>{{cite book|last=Baggese|first=Carl|title=Modesto|year=2011 |publisher=Arcadia Publishing|isbn=978-0738575797|page=61 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2gX9KHhfwd4C&pg=PA61}}</ref>

===Planning and environment===
In 1885, Modesto enacted what is now considered to be the first [[zoning]] ordinance. The ordinance's primary goal was to keep laundries (which were primarily Chinese run), out of the city.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Williamson |first1=C.J.S. |title=Mechanics of Zoning Adjustments |journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=May 1931 |volume=155 |issue=2 |pages=108–122 |doi=10.1177/000271623115500215|s2cid=145796947 }}</ref> After an arrested man filed to contest the constitutionality of the ordinance, the case escalated to the California Supreme Court which found the law to be constitutional.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Bernstein |first1=David E. |last2=Eliot |first2=David |title=Lochner, Parity, and the Chinese Laundry Cases |journal=William and Mary Law Law Review |date=January 1, 1999 |volume=41 |page=211 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.146952}}</ref>

In the late 1980s Modesto embarked on an update to the city's [[general plan]] pursuant to requirements of the State of California. The result was a comprehensive evaluation of alternative population and land use projections along with associated environmental impact analysis. Some of the environmental factors technically assessed were air quality, [[water quality]], [[environmental noise]], [[soil contamination]] and visual impacts.

Much of the soils in Modesto are classified as part of the Hanford series: (HbpA) fine [[sandy loam]], moderately deep over silt.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bureau of Soils|title=Soil survey of ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-LwAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA81|year=1964|publisher=Dept. of Agriculture|page=81}}</ref> These soils are well-drained, moderately coarse-textured soils derived from [[alluvium]] from granitic rock. The Hanford soils are important for the production of a wide variety of irrigated orchard, field, and [[market garden|truck crops]].

Vicinity watercourses include the [[Stanislaus River]], the [[Tuolumne River]] and [[Dry Creek, Stanislaus County|Dry Creek]] which empties into the Tuolumne River. Area groundwater, which is the principal source of water supply in the city,<ref>''Stanislaus County General Plan'' (1987)</ref> has been historically impaired in a fashion that is spatially variable. Water from the nearby Modesto Reservoir is now used to augment city water. In various parts of the city and its perimeter the following [[water pollutant]]s have occurred from time to time: [[nitrate]]s, [[dibromochloromethane]], [[volatile organics]], salinity, [[total dissolved solids]] and other [[pesticide]]s.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Expanded initial study, Boulder Creek subdivision, Stanislaus County'', Earth Metrics, Report 7999: California State Clearinghouse, Sacramento, November 1989.</ref> Each of these contaminants is not present citywide.

The [[EPA]] rates air quality in Modesto as a 23 on a scale to 100 (higher is better), making Modesto an unhealthy place to live for those with breathing difficulties. This is based on ozone alert days and number of pollutants in the air. In May 2010, ''Forbes'' magazine, in association with the [[American Lung Association]], indicated that Modesto was one of the top 25 most polluted cities in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/04/28/polluted-cities-smog-lifestyle-health-american-lung-association-ozone_slide_2.html?partner=msnhealth |work=Forbes |title=List: Worst Cities For Ozone Pollution}}</ref>

===Downtown revitalization===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}
As of the 2000s, downtown Modesto (DOMO) has new attractions including the Gallo Center for the Arts and the new Downtown Plaza adjacent to Modesto Centre Plaza. Downtown Modesto has lost the Hotel Covell, the [[art deco]] Strand Theatre, and the Sears building.

Historic 10th and 11th streets, which were the original locations of the cruising featured in ''American Graffiti'', have been designated by the City of Modesto as the Historic Cruise Route. This is now a tourist walk with information about Modesto's music, car and Graffiti culture.

In 2014, the Walk of Fame was launched on the Historic Cruise Route with markers celebrating classic legends like [[George Lucas]], [[Gene Winfield]], Bart Bartoni and others.

Classic Community Murals was launched by Modesto magazine ''ModestoView'' and the Peer Recovery Art Center to create a series of large scale murals celebrating the Modesto Classic Graffiti heritage. Many of these are on the Cruise Route.

New business incentives have been created to enhance facades, signage, and permitting.  A promenade is being designed to create a special entertainment zone along the corridor between the Modesto Centre Plaza and the Gallo Center for the Arts and the adjacent core streets of 10th, 11th and J streets.

==Geography==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2022}}
Modesto is located in the center of the Central Valley surrounded by the [[California Coast Ranges|Coastal Ranges]] and the [[Sierra Nevada]], and close by, the numerous farmlands that produce a majority of several crops for the United States. There are also grassy and tree-filled preserves nearby. The city is in between the [[Tuolumne River]] and the nearby [[Stanislaus River]]. There is a small creek named Dry Creek, which is badly polluted by agricultural runoff and is adjacent to several parks. Rivers and lakes near [[Waterford, CA|Waterford]] are accessible for a [[kayak]], or small [[motorboat]], and there are several points of public access. This access was given as part of a government plan when [[hydroelectric power]] dams were installed upstream for flood control, [[irrigation]], and [[electric power]] generation. The nearest large open [[seaport]] is the [[Port of Stockton]], used for oceangoing ships that transport goods, particularly cement, fertilizer, and agricultural products, from California to overseas.

===Climate===
Modesto has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (Csa)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Modesto climate: weather by month, temperature, rain - Climates to Travel |url=https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/united-states/modesto |access-date=2024-06-18 |website=www.climatestotravel.com}}</ref> under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. It has cool to mild winters with moderate rainfall and hot, dry summers. Most of the rainfall occurs during the winter and the annual total is {{cvt|13.2|in|mm}}. The highest rainfall in a season was {{cvt|26.01|in|mm}} in 1982–83 and the lowest being {{cvt|4.3|in|mm}} in 1912–1913. Precipitation usually comes in the form of atmospheric rivers or bomb cyclones and some of the most precipitation can come during the El Niño years. In addition, Modesto experiences drought cycles like the rest of California where the seasonal rainfall can be a few inches below average in dry seasons and a few inches above during wet seasons. The city does not have a full storm sewer system, and many streets flood during winter rain storms. Measurable snowfall has only been recorded in only 4 months in the last 100 years with the highest amount being 1.5 inches that fell in January 1962.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Modesto Climate, Weather By Month, Average Temperature (California, United States) - Weather Spark |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/1325/Average-Weather-in-Modesto-California-United-States-Year-Round |access-date=November 29, 2022 |website=weatherspark.com |language=en}}</ref>

Usually on average the weather does not go below 30&nbsp;°F and not above 103&nbsp;°F. Average January temperatures range from {{cvt|56|F|C}} in the day to {{cvt|34|F|C}} at night. There are about 20 days per year that see temperatures at or below {{cvt|32|F|C}} and 79 that are at or above  {{cvt|90|F|C}}.  Winter days that receive precipitation tend to be milder while drier days have freezing nights that allow for frost build up until the morning. Thus, winter temperatures can vary from lows in the low 30s in dry months to 40s in wetter months. Days in the winter can occasionally be as high as {{cvt|70|F|C}}, but there can also be cool rainy days as late as May reaching only {{cvt|60|F|C}}. Average July temperatures range from {{cvt|95|F|C}} in the day to {{cvt|63|F|C}} at night. During the summer months there can be multiple days in a row with high temperatures exceeding {{cvt|100|F|C}}. This can pose health risks for people with weak constitutions or who ignore the dangers of heat stroke. Onshore breezes (known locally as the "delta breeze") moderate these high temperatures somewhat, with cooler air coming in after 8 or 9&nbsp;pm on summer nights, making Modesto potentially a couple or few degrees cooler than the northern and southern parts of the Central Valley.

Modesto's mid-century buildings have been featured four times in Museum of Modern Art publications.

Filmmaker [[George Lucas]], who was born in Modesto, graduated from [[Thomas Downey High School]] in 1962 and attended Modesto Junior College, immortalized the city in his award-winning 1973 film ''[[American Graffiti]]''. The film portrayed the spirit of [[cruising (driving)|cruising]] and friendship on Modesto's 10th and 11th streets in 1962, and inspired a revival of interest in 1950s pop culture.

In 2008 X-Fest featured 50 bands and a crowd of 15,000 people. Much of the profits ended up in local non-profit charities. Some business owners and citizens of Modesto complained of a rowdy and often drunk [[Mardi Gras]] atmosphere exhibited at X-fest. The last X-fest occurred in Modesto in 2015.

Located in downtown Modesto is the State Theater with music acts and independent films.

Downtown Modesto hosts a monthly Art Walk, with local artists displaying art for sale, artist demos, local gallery shows, in a multi-venue map self-guided tour.
