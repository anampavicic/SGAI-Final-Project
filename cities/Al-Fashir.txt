== History ==
Late in the 18th century, Sultan Abd al-Rahman al-Rashid of the [[Sultanate of Darfur]] moved his itinerant court (''fashir'') to a site called Rahad Tendelti while campaigning in the region of northern Darfur as it was a superb spot for a settlement and grazing; eventually the site was renamed to al-Fashir.<ref>{{Cite book |first=Donald |last=Crummey |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/52601158 |title=Land, literacy and the state in Sudanic Africa |date=2005 |publisher=Red Sea Press |isbn=1-56902-182-1 |oclc=52601158}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=Famine That Kills: Darfur |url=https://archive.org/details/faminethatkillsd00dewa |url-access=registration |last=de Waal |first=Alex |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Cary, NC |year=2005 |page=[https://archive.org/details/faminethatkillsd00dewa/page/60 60]}}</ref> A town developed around the sultan's palace grounds.<ref name=EBal/>

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Al-Fashir has a [[Desert climate#Hot desert climates|hot arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh'') with three distinct seasons. There is a bone-dry and relatively "cool" season from October to February when temperatures are merely hot by afternoon and cool in the mornings, which gives way to a sweltering and equally arid "hot season" from March to May with high temperatures around {{convert|38|C|F|1|disp=or}} and morning lows of {{convert|21|C|F|1|disp=or}}. The [[Sahel]]ian [[monsoon]] arrives in June and lasts until September, creating a short [[wet season]] that produces virtually all the year's rainfall of around {{convert|210|mm|in|1|disp=or}}, accompanied by much higher humidity than during the remainder of the year.

Rents and retail sales increased, including the selling of [[bottled water]] and the opening of a pizza parlor to cater to the demand from western aid workers. The number of gas stations has tripled in three years as a result of the increase in the amount of automobiles in the city. Employment opportunities also increased as the United Nations offered jobs to citizens. Economics analyst Adam Ahmed stated that the "people [of Al-Fashir] are beginning to think in a more business-minded way" to make the most of their situation.<ref>Sanders, Edmund.
