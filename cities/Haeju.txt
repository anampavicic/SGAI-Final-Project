'''Haeju'''{{efn|In the 19th century, Haeju was sometimes spelled '''Hai-tsiou'''.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878|p=390}}}} ({{IPA|ko|hɛ.dzu}}) is a city located in [[South Hwanghae Province]] near [[Haeju Bay]] in [[North Korea]]. It is the administrative centre of South Hwanghae Province. As of 2008, the population of the city is estimated to be 273,300. At the beginning of the 20th century, it became a strategic port in Sino-Korean trade. Haeju has chemical-related enterprises and a cement factory.

==History==
The area around Haeju is known to have been inhabited since the [[Neolithic]] period, as shellmounds, pottery, and stone tools have been found at Ryongdangp'o. During the early [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three kingdoms period]], it was briefly governed by a small chieftain, when it was known as "Naemihol" ({{linktext|內|米|忽|郡}}). In 757, however, it was conquered by the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom, who later lost it to [[Silla]]. It was under the [[Goryeo]] dynasty's [[Taejo of Goryeo|King T'aejo]] that it received its current name.

Sohyon Academy (소현서원) was a [[Confucianism|Confucian]] academy founded near Haeju by the famous [[Joseon]]ese scholar [[Yi I]] (1536–84) after his retirement. It is situated in Unbyong Valley, a part of Soktamgugok (Nine valleys of pools and rocks).

According to the North Korean government, the [[Korean War|North Korean attack on South Korea]] on 25 June 1950 was a response to a two-day long bombing by the South Koreans and their surprise attacks on Haeju and other places. Early in the morning of 25 June, before the dawn counterattack in the North Korean account, the South Korean Office of Public Information announced that the Southern forces had  captured Haeju.<ref name="South occupies Haejiu city">{{cite book |last=Keum |first=Jooseop |author-link=Jooseop Keum|editor1-last=Kim |editor1-first=Sebastian C.

[[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] proposed that North Korea would be invited to the [[UN Security Council]] to present its side of the story. Both proposals were voted down.<ref name="William Blum 2004 46-48">{{cite book|author=William Blum|title= Killing Hope: US Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II|url= https://archive.org/details/pdfy-q0ULBH2DJICRS3Vg|year=2004|publisher=Zed Books Ltd.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pdfy-q0ULBH2DJICRS3Vg/page/n45 46]–48}}</ref>

==Culture and travel==

Famous tourist attractions in the city center include [[Puyong Hall|Puyong Pavilion]], the Haeju [[Dharani]] Monument, the [[Haeju Sokbinggo]], and several trees classified as [[Natural monuments of North Korea|living monuments]]. Farther out, scenic spots include [[Suyangsan Falls]], the [[Sokdamgugok]] scenic area, [[Suyangsan Fortress]] and the [[Sohyon Academy]].

==Economy==
Haeju [[Special Economic Zone]] was announced in the Second [[Inter-Korean summit]] meeting between the South Korean president [[Roh Moo-Hyun]] and the North Korean supreme leader [[Kim Jong-Il]]. It was to be a [[Special Economic Zone]] centered on the Haeju port. The zone would have consisted of 16.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of development, and also the expansion of the Haeju port. This project was estimated to cost over US$4.5 billion.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Seo |first=Yang Won |date=2007-10-09 |title=해주 개발땐 비용 46억달러ㆍ경제효과 33억달러 |trans-title=$4.6 billion for Haeju development and $3.3 billion in economic effect. |url=https://www.mk.co.kr/news/politics/4324724 |access-date=2023-03-27 |website=매일경제 |language=ko}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}
