'''Central Luzon''' ({{langx|fil|Gitnang Luzon}}; {{langx|pam|Kalibudtarang Luzon}}; {{langx|pag|Pegley na Luzon}}; {{langx|ilo|Tengnga ti Luzon}}), designated as '''Region III''', is an [[Regions of the Philippines|administrative region]] in the Philippines. The region comprises seven provinces: [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]], [[Bataan]], [[Bulacan]], [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Pampanga]] (with its capital, [[San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando City]] serving as the regional center), [[Tarlac]], and [[Zambales]]; and two [[Cities of the Philippines#Independent cities|highly urbanized cities]], [[Angeles City|Angeles]] and [[Olongapo]]. [[San Jose del Monte]] is the most populous city in the region. The region contains the largest [[plain]] in the country and produces most of the country's rice supply, earning itself the nickname "Rice Granary of the Philippines". It is also the region to have the most number of provinces.<ref name="Climate Change, Justice and Sustainability">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=epsmm-bhnqcC|title=Climate Change, Justice and Sustainability: Linking Climate and Development Policy|last1=Edenhofer|first1=Ottmar|last2=Wallacher|first2=Johannes|last3=Lotze-Campen|first3=Hermann|last4=Reder|first4=Michael|last5=Knopf|first5=Brigitte|last6=Müller|first6=Johannes|date=June 25, 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9789400745407|page=206|language=en|ref=Climate Change, Justice and Sustainability}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The current name of the region refers to its position on the island of [[Luzon]]. The term was coined by American colonialists after the defeat of the [[First Philippine Republic]]. There have been proposals to rename the current Central Luzon region into the [[Luzones]] region. The proposed name is in reference to the old name of Luzon island, Luções, which was later used to refer to the central area of the island, stretching from Pangasinan in the north, all the way to [[Pampanga]] in the south.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}} The term Luções literally translates into Luzones.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://opinion.inquirer.net/95645/change-name-will-good-philippines|title = Change in name will be good for Philippines|date = July 15, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Should the Philippines be renamed?

While there are a number of competing [[models of migration to the Philippines]], it is generally believed that The earliest [[modern human]] migrations into the Philippine islands were during the [[Paleolithic]], around 40,000 years ago, representing the people from whom the [[Aeta peoples]] have been believed by researchers to be descended.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Jinam |display-authors=etal |date=8 August 2017 |title=Discerning the Origins of the Negritos, First Sundaland People: Deep Divergence and Archaic Admixture |url=https://academic.oup.com/gbe/article/9/8/2013/3952725 |access-date=2023-03-01 |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution|volume=9 |issue=8 |pages=2013–2022 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evx118 |pmid=28854687 |pmc=5597900 }}</ref> This was followed by two other migration waves between 25,000 and 12,000 years ago.

Aetas were displaced to the mountain areas by the end of the 16th century. Kapampangans settled Aurora alongside Aetas and Bugkalots. [[Pangasinan people]] are the native settlers in northwest area of Central Luzon; [[Igorot people]], particularly Kalanguya, Isinay, and Bugkalot, are native residents in northern area of Central Luzon, precisely present-day Nueva Ecija, with the Bugkalots also live in northwest Aurora.

=== Colonial era ===
When the Spaniards arrived and settled the Philippines, Provincia de La Pampanga was established in the largest area of Central Luzon in 1571; portion of Central Luzon was made up of Pangasinán created in 1580. The next provinces that were created out of Pampanga were Bulacan and Zambales which were both established in 1578. Baler & Casiguran  became part of Kalilayan, which included modern Nueva Ecija, until Kalilayan changed its name to Tayabas in 1749, taken from the [[tayabas|town of the same name]].<ref name=AuroraHist>{{Cite web |url=https://ipedaurora.wordpress.com/home/page/ |title=The Brief History of Aurora |access-date=2023-11-05 |archive-date=2023-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231105124347/https://ipedaurora.wordpress.com/home/page/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.aurora.ph/mobile/history.html|title=Aurora, Philippines – History|website=www.aurora.ph|language=en|access-date=February 7, 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208033623/http://www.aurora.ph/mobile/history.html|archive-date=February 8, 2017}}</ref><ref name="BalerSpanish">[http://www.aurora.ph/mobile/baler-aurora-book/spanish-occupation.html Baler During Spanish Occupation] in Aurora.ph</ref><ref name="QuezonGovPH-History">{{cite web|title=History of Quezon Province|url=http://www.quezon.gov.ph/homepage/?info=quezonhistory|website=Provincial Government of Quezon|access-date=April 4, 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001223830/http://www.quezon.gov.ph/homepage/?info=quezonhistory|archive-date=October 1, 2016}}</ref> Nueva Ecija was created as a military district or ''comandancia'' governed by [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Fausto Cruzat y Góngora]] in 1701, but still part of Pampanga at that time.

When the polities of Tondo and Maynila fell due to the Spanish, the Tagalog-majority areas grew through Tagalog migrations in portions of Central Luzon and north Mimaropa as a Tagalog migration policy was implemented by Spain. This happened again when [[British occupation of Manila]] happened in 1762, when many Tagalog refugees from Manila and north areas of Cavite escaped to Bulacan and to neighboring Nueva Ecija, where the original Kapampangan settlers welcomed them; Bulacan and Nueva Ecija were natively Kapampangan when Spaniards arrived; majority of Kapampangans sold their lands to the newly arrived Tagalog settlers and others intermarried with and assimilated to the Tagalog, which made Bulacan and Nueva Ecija dominantly Tagalog, many of the Tagalog settlers arrived in Nueva Ecija directly from Bulacan;<ref name="Indúng Kapampangan">{{Cite web |url=https://www.sinupan.org/2019/02/27/the-historical-indung-kapampangan-evidence-from-history-and-place-names/ |title=The Historical Indúng Kapampángan: Evidence from History and Place Names |date=February 27, 2019 |access-date=November 28, 2023 |archive-date=December 1, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231201071013/https://www.sinupan.org/2019/02/27/the-historical-indung-kapampangan-evidence-from-history-and-place-names/ |url-status=live }}</ref> also, the sparsely populated valley of the Zambales region was later settled by migrants, largely from the [[Southern Tagalog|Tagalog]] and [[Ilocos region]]s, leading to the assimilation of Sambals to the Tagalog and Ilocano settlers and to the modern decline in the Sambal identity and language.<ref name="Indúng Kapampangan"/><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://subliblog.com/2019/08/04/zambales-province-home-province-of-subic-bay-and-mt-pinatubo/ |title=Zambales Province, Home Province of Subic Bay and Mt.

The Tagalog and Ilocano migrations and settlements made Tagalog the lingua franca of Central Luzon and Ilocano the lingua franca in north areas of the region and south central Zambales. Many Ilocano settlers became assimilated in the areas with the Kapampangan and Tagalog majority populations, adopting Kapampangan and Tagalog as their native language while speaking Ilocano as 2nd language. Ilocano migrations and settlements continued in modern Aurora and Nueva Ecija in U.S. territorial rule in 20th century; in Aurora, Ilocano settlers lived in [[Dingalan]] and [[Dipaculao]].

When [[Rafael María de Aguilar y Ponce de León]] took over as governor-general of the Philippines, he decreed the separation of the military- district of Nueva Ecija from the province of Pampanga and became a regular province on April 25, 1801, including the town of Baler, acquired from Tayabas.<ref name=AuroraHist/>

In 1818, Nueva Ecija annexed the towns of [[Palanan]] from [[isabela (province)|Isabela]], as well as Baler, Casiguran, Infanta (formerly called Binangonan de Lampon) and Polillo Islands from Tayabas, and Cagayan, [[Nueva Vizcaya]], Quirino, and part of Rizal.<ref name=":1"/><ref>[https://region3.dilg.gov.ph/nueva-ecija/index.php/about/who-we-are Who We Are: Nueva Ecija]</ref> In 1853, the new military district of Tayabas was separated from Nueva Ecija and included present-day Southern Quezon as well as present-day Aurora. In 1858, Binangonan de Lampon and the Polillo Islands were separated from Nueva Ecija to form part of Infanta.<ref name=":2" /> Between 1855 and 1885, El Principe was established as its own Military Comandancia under the rule of Nueva Ecija with its capital in Baler.<ref name=":1"/> In 1873, Tarlac was established and was created from south Pangasinan and north Pampanga; this is the last province to be created in Central Luzon.

In 1901, towns of [[Nueva Ecija]], namely [[Balungao]], [[rosales, Pangasinan|Rosales]], [[san Quintin, Pangasinan|San Quintin]] and [[Umingan]] were annexed to the province of Pangasinan.<ref name=":2"/> On November 30, 1903, several municipalities from northern [[Zambales]] including Agno, Alaminos, Anda, Bani, Bolinao, Burgos, Dasol, Infanta and Mabini were ceded to Pangasinan by the American colonial government. These municipalities were a part of the homeland of the Sambal people who wanted to remain within the Zambales province. This 1903 colonial decision has yet to be reverted.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bautista|first1=Joseph|title=Agno Rustic Pangasinan 0|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/agno-rustic-pangasinan/371628/|website=The Manila Times|date=January 2018|access-date=May 2, 2018|archive-date=May 2, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180502143806/http://www.manilatimes.net/agno-rustic-pangasinan/371628/|url-status=live}}</ref> The reason for transferring those towns from Nueva Ecija & Zambales to Pangasinan is because they were geographically further away from the capitals.

In 1902, the district of El Príncipe was separated from Nueva Ecija and transferred to the province of [[Tayabas (province)|Tayabas]] (now Quezon).<ref name=FastFactsPhilProv-Aurora>{{cite book|last1=Lancion|first1=Conrado M.

=== World War II ===
Central Luzon featured prominently during [[Pacific War|World War II]], becoming one of the earliest targets of Japanese attacks because of the presence of U.S. Military bases in the area, and also because General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s plans for responding to the invasion involved falling back to positions in Bataan in Central Luzon, as well as the island of Corregidor which is administered by [[Cavite]] province in Southern Luzon.

The hostilities of the war began with simultaneous attacks [[attack on Pearl Harbor|on Pearl Harbor]]  and [[Attack on Clark Field|on Clark Field]]<ref name=psd/> and also on a smaller fighter base at [[Iba, Zambales|Iba]], both in Central Luzon.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Disaster in the Philippines |url=https://www.airandspaceforces.com/article/disaster-in-the-philippines/ |access-date=2023-12-01 |website=Air & Space Forces Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref> The dates of those attacks are different, however, because they took place across different sides of the [[International Date Line]].<ref name=psd>{{cite book |last=Dull |first=Paul S. |title =A Battle History of The Imperial Japanese Navy (1941-1945) |publisher =Naval Institute Press |date =1978 |location =Annapolis, Maryland |pages =22–30 }}</ref>

Prior to the 1941 [[Japanese Occupation of the Philippines|Japanese invasion]], Bataan was a military reservation for the purpose of defending the fortress island of [[Corregidor]].<ref>"Fall of the Philippines," Louis Morton</ref> The [[United States Army|US Army]] stored nearly {{convert|1000000|USgal|m3}} of [[gasoline]] there, along with various munitions. At the southern tip of the peninsula the U.S. Navy had established a small base at the port of Mariveles.

Shortly after the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Japanese Army]] [[Philippines campaign (1941–1942)|invaded the country]] in December 1941, the combined US and Filipino forces were being gradually overrun and General [[Douglas MacArthur]] moved his troops to the Bataan Peninsula in an attempt to hold out until a relief force could be sent from the US. Japanese forces started a siege of the peninsula on January 7, 1942, and launched an all-out assault on April 3.<ref>"Bataan: Our Last Ditch," Lt. Col. John Whitman, USA.</ref> The majority of the American and Filipino forces were compelled to surrender on April 9 and were forced to march more than {{convert|100|km|mi|sp=us}} from Bataan to [[Capas, Tarlac|Capas]], [[Tarlac]], which became known as the [[Bataan Death March]].

After the surrenders of Bataan and Corregidor, many who escaped the Japanese reorganized in the mountains as [[guerrilla]]s still loyal to the U.S. Army Forces Far East ([[USAFFE]]). This included the group of [[Ramon Magsaysay]] in Zambales, which grew to a 10,000-man force by the end of the war;<ref name="Reader's Digest">{{cite book|author=Manahan, Manuel P.|title=Reader's Digest November 1987 issue: Biographical Tribute to Ramon Magsaysay|year=1987|pages=17–23}}</ref> the 22,000-man group of [[Russell W.

In March 1942, the [[Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930|Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas]] (PKP-1930, a predecessor of the current [[Communist Party of the Philippines]]) likewise led in the organization of a broad [[united front]] resistance to the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]] called ''Hukbong Mapagpalaya ng Bayan'',<ref name="Saulo">{{cite book|last1=Saulo |first1=Alfredo |title=Communism in the Philippines: An Introduction |date=1990 |publisher=[[Ateneo de Manila University Press]] |location=Quezon City |isbn=971-550-403-5}}</ref>{{rp|44}} (lit. 'People's Liberation Army'). The organization operated successfully in underminng the Japanese until the end of the war, after which they found themselves alienated by the victorious U.S. led allied forces, most of whom had already developed the anticommunist sentiment which would mark the beginning of the [[Cold War]].  The PKP-1930 would thus resolve to reconstitute the organization as the armed wing of their revolutionary party.<ref name="Saulo" />{{rp|44}}

The battle plan of the allied efforts to liberate the Philippines from the Japanese called for invasion forces landing to the north and south of Manila, which would converge on the capital, which was the primary objective. This would mean that the Northern force, which landed in the [[Lingayen Gulf]], would cross the Central Luzon plains to get to Manila.

Clark Air Base had a notable role in the [[Battle of Luzon]] on 23 January 1944, in that it was the first major point of resistance where the japanese fought back against allied forces who had landed in [[Agoo]], [[Lingayen]], and other towns in along the gulf, a province north.<ref name="brochure">{{cite web|url= http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/luzon/72-28.htm |title=Luzon 1944–1945 |access-date=6 December 2008 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081215091059/http://www.history.army.mil/brochures/luzon/72-28.htm| archive-date= 15 December 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Learning that there were Prisoners of War at risk of being murdered at a POW Camp in [[Cabanatuan]], [[Nueva Ecija]], 133 U.S. soldiers from the 6th Ranger Battalion and Alamo Scouts, and about 250–280 Filipino guerrillas were detatched from the main spearhead to attempt to rescue the prisoners.

=== Postwar era ===

The Filipino [[Communism|communist]] [[Hukbalahap]] [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla movement]] formed by the farmers of Central Luzon to fight the Japanese occupation, had found themselves sidelined by the new post-independence [[Philippine government]] which had taken up the [[Red Scare in the Philippines|fear of communist influence]] which marked the beginning of the cold war in the west. So they decided to extended their fight into a rebellion against the new government, only to be put down through a series of reforms and military victories by [[Secretary of National Defense (Philippines)|Defense Secretary]], and later President, [[Ramon Magsaysay]].<ref>Jeff Goodwin, [https://archive.org/details/nootherwayout00jeff/page/118 <!-- quote=huk rebellion. --> No Other Way Out], Cambridge University Press, 2001, p.119, {{ISBN|0-521-62948-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-62948-5}}</ref>

Ultimately more effective than those who took up arms were the numerous political and labor movements who kept working towards agricultural land reform and stronger labor rights, with laborers' and farmers' protests gathering enough steam that several Philippine presidents were forced to meet with them and then concede to their demands. Among the most successful of these  were the Land Justice March of the political group known as the Filipino Agrarian Reform Movement (FARM), which intended to march from Tarlac to Malacañang in 1969, although President Marcos was forced to give in to their demands early, meeting them while they were still at [[Camp Servillano Aquino]] in Tarlac City itself.<ref name ="GazetteHistoryProtest"/>
