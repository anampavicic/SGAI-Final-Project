'''Castellón de la Plana'''{{efn|{{IPA|es|kasteˈʎon de la ˈplana|lang}}}} (officially<ref>[http://www.dogv.gva.es/datos/2019/03/23/pdf/2019_2901.pdf Decret 40/2019, de 22 de març, del Consell, d'aprovació del canvi de denominació del municipi de Castelló de la Plana/Castellón de la Plana per la forma exclusiva en valencià Castelló de la Plana] Generalitat Valenciana</ref> in {{langx|ca-valencia|'''Castelló de la Plana'''}}),{{efn|{{IPA-va|kasteˈʎo ðe la ˈplana|lang}}}} or simply '''Castellón''' ({{langx|ca-valencia|'''Castelló'''|link=no}}), is the capital city of the [[province of Castellón]], in the [[Valencian Community]], [[Spain]]. It is located in the east of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], on the [[Costa del Azahar]] by the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The mountain range known as [[Desert de les Palmes]] rises inland north of the town.

According to the 2018 census, Castellón has a population of 174,264 inhabitants (called  ''castellonenses'' in Spanish and ''castellonencs'' in Valencian), ranking as the fourth most populated city in the Valencian Community (after [[Valencia]], [[Alicante]] and [[Elche]]). The [[Prime Meridian]], or Greenwich Meridian, intersects the 40th parallel at Castellón de la Plana and is commemorated with a monolith in Meridian Park (''Parc del Meridià'') located at the exact point where this occurs.

==History==
The town inherited the name from a Moorish castle on the top of the hill of Magdalena (the {{ill|Castle of Fadrell|es|Castillo de Fadrell}}), a {{ill|Ḥiṣn|es|lt=''ḥiṣn''}} dominating over a demarcation roughly consisting of the current-day municipalities of Castellón and [[Almassora]].{{Sfn|Rabassa Vaquer|2008|p=9}} The area capitulated to [[James I of Aragon]] in 1233.{{Sfn|Rabassa Vaquer|2008|p=10}} This was followed by a series of attempts to create new settlements in the area starting with the ''[[alqueria]]'' of Benimahomet, the first Christian project to leave the castle, with mixed results.{{Sfn|Rabassa Vaquer|2008|p=10}} Following the 1247 mudéjar revolt, James I decreed the expulsion of the ''[[mudéjar]]es'' from the area in 1248.{{Sfn|Rabassa Vaquer|2008|p=11}} The current settlement was however not founded until the 1250s, after James I, on 8 September 1251, granted Ximén Pérez d'Arenós a privilege authorising him to move from the castle to a new unspecified place in the plains (''plana'').{{Sfn|Rabassa Vaquer|2008|pp=10–11}} Tradition claims that the move was completed by the third Sunday of [[Lent]], 1252.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the city was protected by [[moat]]s, walls and [[tower]]s, and a church was built, later becoming a cathedral. 

In the 16th century the town was one of the last [[fortification|strongholds]] in the [[Revolta de les Germanies]] (local [[guild]]s). It also supported [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Charles of Austria]] in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]] (1701–14), but was later taken by the troops of [[Philip V of Spain|Philip d'Anjou]].

In the 19th century, the city walls were torn down and it slowly began to expand, a process interrupted by the [[Peninsular War|War of Independence]] against [[Napoleon]] (1804–14) and the [[Carlism|Carlist Wars]] (1833–63). In 1833 Castelló became the capital of the newly constituted province. In the second half of the 19th century, the city again began to expand, marked by the arrival of the railway, the enlargement of the port and the construction of representative buildings (Provincial Hospital, [[Casino]], Theater) and parks.

In 1991 a university ([[Jaume I University]]) was established, set upon a modern campus. The local [[Economic system|economy]] is based on industry, tourism and [[craft]]-work.

== Main sights ==
Most of the historical buildings are located in the diminutive old town, around the Plaça Major (Main Square). These include:
* The ''[[Concatedral de Santa Maria, Castelló|Concatedral de Santa Maria]]'' (co-cathedral of Saint Mary), built in a [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]]-style in the 13th century and reconstructed one century later after destruction by fire. The present building is another reconstruction after the demolition ordered by the council during the Spanish civil war (1936).<ref>[http://www.memoriarepublicana.com/Persecrelig/monumvalencia.html]. Obras religiosas destruidas durante la guerra civil (Spanish)</ref>
* The ''Ajuntament'' (City Hall), erected at the beginning of the 18th century. It features a [[Tuscany|Tuscan-style]] façade rising up over a [[colonnade]].
*[[File:Planetario de Castellón de la Plana.JPG|thumb|Planetari de Castelló]]The free-standing bell-tower of the procathedral, known as ''[[El Fadrí]]'' (the single man), built in the 15th century.
* The ''Llotja del Cànem'' ([[Hemp]] Exchange Market), built during the first half of the 17th century to be used by traders in hempen cloth and ropes, a very important activity in the area at the time. Today the building is used by the University for cultural events and temporary exhibitions.
* On the northeast edge of the town, at the end of a broad avenue decorated with orange trees, stands the Basílica of Santa Maria del ''Lledó'' (European [[Celtis|Hackberry]] or ''Celtis australis''), a basilica devoted to an image of the Virgin Mary found in 1366 by a farmer when he was ploughing his lands. The original 14th-century chapel was extended to its present Baroque form during the 16th century.
* [[Espai d'Art Contemporani de Castelló]], Museum for Modern Art
* Teatre Principal

==Events==
The annual festivities in Castellón are a week of celebrations three weeks before Easter every year called [[Magdalena Festival|La Magdalena]]. People come from all over the province and many international bands and groups participate.

==Sports==
The city has the professional [[basketball]] team [[AB Castelló]], which plays in [[LEB Oro]], Spanish second basketball division.

The local professional [[Association football|football]] club is [[CD Castellón]], which currently plays in the [[Segunda división]] (Spanish second division). It holds home games at [[Nou Estadi Castàlia]], which has a capacity of 15,500 seats. Despite its stadium and social support, the club financial problems and unstable history brought it to play in semi-pro and amateur regional divisions, not playing in La Liga since the 1990–91 season. On 21 March 2018, Castellón beat the record of seasonal tickets in the fourth-tier division with 12,701, and is considered a giant amongst minnows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cdcastellon.com/el-cd-castellon-hace-historia-al-superar-el-record-de-abonados-en-tercera-division/|title=El CD Castellón hace historia al superar el récord de abonados en Tercera División|date=21 March 2018|access-date=21 March 2018|language=es}}</ref> The presence of [[Villarreal CF]] in the adjacent town (only 8&nbsp;km away) has created a fierce rivalry for geographical reasons, especially due to the success of Villarreal in the last decades.

The city is host to [[futsal]] club [[CFS Bisontes Castellón]], which under the name ''Playas de Castellón'' was one of the best Spanish and European futsal clubs in the late 90s and early 2000s, having won the [[Primera División de Futsal|premier professional futsal league]] in Spain twice in 2000 and 2001, and the [[UEFA Futsal Cup]] three consecutive times in 2001, 2002 and 2003.

==Education==
[[File:Ayuntamiento de Castellón de la Plana, Castellón.JPG|thumb|Ajuntament de Castelló de la Plana]]
[[Jaume I University]] was founded in 1991, and in 2014 there were approximately 15,000 students enrolled who share a single campus.

==Transport==
[[File:Aeropuerto de Castellón.JPG|thumb|Castellón-Costa Azahar Airport]]
The small [[Castellón Airport]] offers charter and general aviation services, as well as scheduled passenger services to London, Bucharest and Poznań. The new [[Castellón-Costa Azahar Airport]] is designed to support large international jet flights and was completed in 2011. It has become a symbol of the wasteful spending prior to the [[2008–13 Spanish financial crisis]]. [[Valencia Airport]] is about {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} south whilst [[Alicante Airport]] is another 185&nbsp;km (115&nbsp;mi) further down the coast.

The city is served by the [[Castellón de la Plana railway station]]. The [[Euromed (train)|Euromed railway line]] links [[Alicante railway station|Alicante]] to [[Barcelona Sants railway station|Barcelona]].
[[File:Aeropuerto de Castellón-Costa Azahar, avión de Bristol.JPG|thumb|Castellón-Costa Azahar Airport]]
Nowadays, the city has a new public transport called [[TRAM of Castellón]] which is a trolleybus. There is just one line, [[Línia 1 (TRAM of Castellón)]], but authorities are planning to build a second line.
