==History==
{{see also|Asuka period|Nara period|Historic Sites of Nara Prefecture}}
Nara Prefecture region is considered one of the oldest [[regions in Japan]], having been in existence for thousands of years, and is widely viewed as the Japanese [[cradle of civilization]]. Like [[Kyoto]], Nara was one of [[Imperial Japan]]'s earliest [[Capital of Japan|capital]] cities.<ref>{{cite book | given = Keiji | surname = Imamura | pages = 13 | title = Prehistoric Japan: New Perspectives on Insular East Asia | publisher = University of Hawaii Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | given = Pradyumna Prasad | surname = Karan | pages = 237 | title = Japan in the 21st Century: Environment, Economy, and Society | publisher = University Press of Kentucky}}</ref> The current form of Nara Prefecture was officially created in 1887 when it became independent of [[Osaka Prefecture]].

Historically, Nara Prefecture was also known as [[Yamato Province|Yamato-no-kuni]] or Yamato Province.<ref>Nussbaum, "Yamato" at {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 1046|page=1046}}.</ref>

===Up to Nara period===
From the third century to the fourth century, a poorly documented political force existed at the foot of [[Mount Miwa]], east of Nara Basin.  It sought unification of most parts in Japan. Since the historical beginning of Japan, [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] was its political center.

Ancient capitals of Japan were built on the land of Nara, namely [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka-kyō]], [[Fujiwara-kyō]] (694–710)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/en/list/29/J84604/p/2/item/14924?sort=publish_date%253Ar|title=藤原宮大極殿院の調査(飛鳥藤原第182次)|last=奈良文化財研究所|date=2014-11-08|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref> and [[Heijō-kyō]] (most of 710–784).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sitereports.nabunken.go.jp/291|title=出土品に見る奈良のやきものと暮らし|last=奈良市埋蔵文化財調査センター|date=2009-11-02|website=Comprehensive Database of Archaeological Site Reports in Japan|access-date=2016-09-02}}</ref> The capital cities of Fujiwara and Heijō are believed to have been modeled after Chinese capitals at the time, incorporating grid layout patterns. The royal court also established relations with [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and then [[Tang dynasty]] China and sent students to the Middle Kingdom to learn high civilization. By 7th century, Nara accepted the many immigrants including refugees of [[Baekje]] who had escaped from war disturbances of the southern part of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. The first high civilization with royal patronage of [[Buddhism]] flourished in today's Nara city (710–784 AD).

===Nara in the Heian period===
[[File:Kofukuji12st5s3200.jpg|thumb|right|Kōfuku-ji]]

In 784, [[Emperor Kanmu]] decided to relocate the capital to [[Nagaoka-kyō]] in [[Yamashiro Province]], followed by another move in 794 to [[Heian-kyō]],  marking the start of the [[Heian period]]. The temples in Nara remained powerful beyond the move of political capital, thus giving Nara a synonym of "Nanto" (meaning "South Capital") as opposed to Heian-kyō, situated in the north. Close to the end of Heian period, [[Taira no Shigehira]], a son of [[Taira no Kiyomori]], was ordered by his father to depress the power of various parties, mainly [[Kōfuku-ji]] and [[Tōdai-ji]], who were backing up an opposition group headed by [[Prince Mochihito]]. The movement led to a collision between the [[Taira clan|Taira]] and the Nara temples in 1180. This clash eventually led to [[Kōfuku-ji]] and [[Tōdai-ji]] being set on fire, resulting in vast destruction of architectural heritage.

===Medieval Nara===
[[File:Kouyou of Yoshinoyama.JPG|thumb|right|The red autumn leaves in Yoshino]]

At the rise of the [[Minamoto clan|Minamoto]] to its ruling seat and the opening of [[Kamakura shogunate]], Nara enjoyed the support of [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] toward restoration. [[Kōfuku-ji]], being the "home temple" to the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara]] since its foundation, not only regained the power it had before but became a ''de facto'' regional chief of Yamato Province. With the reconstruction of [[Kōfuku-ji]] and [[Tōdai-ji]], a town was growing again near the two temples.

The [[Nanboku-chō period]], starting in 1336, brought more instability to Nara. As [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] chose [[Yoshino District|Yoshino]] as his base, a power struggle arose in Kōfuku-ji with a group supporting the South and another siding the North court. Likewise, local clans were split into two. Kōfuku-ji recovered its control over the province for a short time at the surrender of the South Court in 1392, while the internal power game of the temple itself opened a way for the local samurai clans to spring up and fight with each other, gradually acquiring their own territories, thus diminishing the influence of Kōfuku-ji overall.

===The Sengoku and Edo periods ===
[[File:Koriyama Castle Nara-b.jpg|thumb|The restored turret of [[Kōriyama Castle (Nara Prefecture)|Kōriyama Castle]]]]

Later, the whole province of Yamato got drawn into the confusion of the [[Sengoku period]]. Tōdai-ji was once again set on fire in 1567, when [[Matsunaga Hisahide]], who was later appointed by [[Oda Nobunaga]] to the lord of Yamato Province, fought for supremacy against his former master [[Miyoshi clan|Miyoshi family]]. Followed by short appointments of [[Tsutsui Junkei]] and [[Toyotomi Hidenaga]] by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] to the lord, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] ultimately ruled the city of Nara directly, and most parts of Yamato province with a few feudal lords allocated at [[Yamatokōriyama|Kōriyama]], [[Takatori, Nara|Takatori]] and other places. With industry and commerce developing in the 18th century, the economy of the province was incorporated into prosperous [[Osaka]], the commercial capital of Japan at the time.

=== From the establishment of Nara Prefecture to the present===
A first prefecture (briefly ''-fu'' in 1868, but ''-ken'' for most of the time)<ref>[http://www.library.pref.nara.jp/sites/default/files/002_s.pdf 奈良県の誕生 ("The birth of Nara prefecture")], Nara Prefectural Library, retrieved March 15, 2019.</ref> named Nara was established in the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868 as successor to the shogunate administration of the shogunate city and shogunate lands in Yamato. After the 1871 [[Abolition of the han system]], Nara was merged with other prefectures (from former han, see [[List of Han#Yamato Province]]) and cleared of ex-/enclaves to encompass all of Yamato province. In 1876, Nara was merged into [[Sakai Prefecture|Sakai]] which in turn became part of Osaka in 1881. In 1887, Nara became independent again, with [[Saisho Atsushi]] as the first governor.<ref>https://www.library.pref.nara.jp/sites/default/files/002_s.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=August 2024}}</ref><ref name="wwnaraken">Nara Prefecture for children: [http://www.pref.nara.jp/1335.htm ならけんはいつできたのかな (~"When was Nara prefecture created?")], Nara Prefectural Government, retrieved March 15, 2019.</ref> The first prefectural assembly of Nara was elected in the same year and opened its first session in 1888 in the gallery of the main hall of Tōdai temple.<ref name="wwnaraken"/>

In the 1889 Great Meiji mergers which subdivided all (then 45) prefectures into modern [[Municipalities of Japan|municipalities]], Nara prefecture's 16 [[Districts of Japan|districts]] were subdivided into 154 municipalities: 10 [[Towns of Japan|towns]] and 144 [[Villages of Japan|villages]]. The first [[Cities of Japan|city]] in Nara was only established in 1898 when Nara Town from [[Soekami District, Nara|Soekami District]] was made district-independent to become [[Nara, Nara|Nara City]] (see [[List of mergers in Nara Prefecture]] and [[List of mergers in Osaka Prefecture]]).

The economic dependency to Osaka even characterizes today's Nara Prefecture, for many inhabitants commute to Osaka to work or study there.

==Geography==
[[File:Nara géolocalisation relief.svg|thumb|Topographic map of Nara Prefecture]]
[[File:Map of Nara Prefecture Ja.svg|thumb|Administrative map of Nara Prefecture<br />{{legend0|#EAB|City}} {{legend0|#ED9|Town}} {{legend0|#BFE|Village}}]]

Nara Prefecture is part of the [[Kansai]], or Kinki, region of Japan, and is located in the middle of the [[Kii Peninsula]] on the western half of [[Honshu]]. Nara Prefecture is landlocked. It is bordered to the west by [[Wakayama Prefecture]] and [[Osaka Prefecture]]; on the north by [[Kyoto Prefecture]] and on the east by [[Mie Prefecture]].

Nara Prefecture is {{convert|78.5|km}} from east to west and {{convert|103.6|km}} from north to south.

Most of the prefecture is covered by mountains and forests, leaving an inhabitable area of only {{convert|851|km2|sqmi}}. The ratio of inhabitable area to total area is 23%, ranked 43rd among the 47 prefectures in Japan.<ref name="100indices">{{cite web|title=奈良県統計情報 "100の指標" ("100 Indices of Nara" by Nara Statistics Division, Nara Prefecture)|language=ja|url=http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/index.htm|access-date=2007-03-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216005919/http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/index.htm|archive-date=February 16, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Nara Prefecture is bisected by the [[Japan Median Tectonic Line]] (MTL) running through its territory east to west, along the [[Kinokawa River|Yoshino River]]. On the northern side of the MTL is the so-called Inner Zone, where active [[Geologic fault|faults]] running north to south are still shaping the landscape. The Ikoma Mountains in the northwest form the border with Osaka Prefecture. The Nara Basin, which lies to the east of these mountains, contains the highest concentration of population in Nara Prefecture. Further east are the Kasagi Mountains, which separate the Basin from the Yamato Highlands.

South of the MTL is the Outer Zone, comprising the Kii Mountains, which occupy about 60% of the land area of the prefecture. The Ōmine Range is in the center of the Kii Mountains, running north to south, with steep valleys on both sides. The tallest mountain in Nara Prefecture, and indeed in the Kansai region, is [[Mount Hakkyō]]. To the west, separating Nara Prefecture from Wakayama Prefecture, is the Obako Range, with peaks around {{convert|1300|m|ft}}. To the east, bordering Mie Prefecture, is the Daikō Range, including [[Odaigahara-san|Mount Ōdaigahara]]. This mountainous region is also home to a [[World Heritage Site]], the [[Sacred Sites and Pilgrimage Routes in the Kii Mountain Range]]".

About 17% of the total land area of the prefecture is designated as [[List of national parks of Japan#History|National Park]] land, comprising the [[Yoshino-Kumano National Park]], [[Kongō-Ikoma-Kisen Quasi-National Park|Kongō-Ikoma-Kisen]], [[Kōya-Ryūjin Quasi-National Park|Kōya-Ryūjin]], [[Murō-Akame-Aoyama Quasi-National Park|Murō-Akame-Aoyama]], and [[Yamato-Aogaki Quasi-National Park|Yamato-Aogaki]] Quasi-National Parks; and the [[Tsukigase-Kōnoyama Prefectural Natural Park|Tsukigase-Kōnoyama]], [[Yata Prefectural Natural Park|Yata]], and [[Yoshinogawa-Tsuboro Prefectural Natural Park|Yoshinogawa-Tsuboro]] Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/nature/nps/park/doc/files/np_6.pdf |title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |date=1 April 2012 |access-date=29 May 2014}}</ref>

===Climate===
[[File:Tanzan jinja05s3200.jpg|thumb|[[Tanzan Shrine]] in autumn]]

In the Nara Basin, the climate has inland characteristics, as represented in the bigger temperature variance within the same day, and the difference of summer and winter temperatures. Winter temperatures average about {{convert|3|to|5|°C}}, and {{convert|25|to|28|°C}} in the summer with highest reaching close to {{convert|35|°C}}. There is not a single year over the last decade (since 1990, up to 2007) with more than 10 days of snowfall recorded by Nara Local Meteorological Observatory.

The climate in the rest of the prefecture are mountainous, and especially in the south, with below {{convert|-5|°C}} being the extreme minimum in winter. Heavy rainfall is observed in summer. The annual accumulated rainfall ranges as much as {{convert|3000|to|5000|mm|in}}, which is among the heaviest in Japan.

Spring and fall are temperate. The mountainous region of [[Yoshino, Nara|Yoshino]] has been popular both historically and presently for its [[cherry]] blossoms in the spring. In the fall, the southern mountains are equally striking with the changing of the [[oak]] trees.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

===Municipalities===
{{See also|List of cities in Nara Prefecture by population}}
Since 2006, there are 39 [[Municipalities of Japan|municipalities]] in Nara Prefecture: twelve [by definition: district-independent] [[Cities of Japan|cities]] and seven remaining  [[Districts of Japan|districts]] containing 15 [[Towns of Japan|towns]] and twelve [[Villages of Japan|villages]]:

According to the 2005 Census of Japan, Nara Prefecture has a population of 1,421,310, which is a decrease of 1.5%, since the year 2000.<ref name="censusnara">{{cite web|title=Population Census 2005|language=ja|url=http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/chousa_shoukai/h17kokusei/index.html |access-date = 2007-04-10 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080415201002/http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/chousa_shoukai/h17kokusei/index.html |archive-date = April 15, 2008}} (Including official amendment of March 5, 2007)</ref>

The decline continued in 2006, with another decrease of 4,987 people compared to 2005. This includes a natural decrease from previous year of 288 people (11,404 births minus 11,692 deaths) and a decrease due to net domestic migration of 4,627 people outbound from the prefecture, and a decrease of 72 registered foreigners. Net domestic migration has turned into a continuous outbound trend since 1998. The largest destinations of migration in 2005 were the prefectures of Kyoto, Tokyo, and Hyōgo, with respectively a net of 1,130,982 and 451 people moving over. The largest inbound migration was from [[Niigata Prefecture]], contributing to a net increase of 39 people. 13.7% of its population were reported as under 15, 65.9% between 15 and 64, and 20.4% were 65 or older. Females made up approximately 52.5% of the population.<ref name="popnara">{{cite web|title=Population Statistics of Nara Prefecture 2006|language=ja|url=http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/group/jinkou/jinkou.htm |access-date= 2007-04-10 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080118064416/http://www.pref.nara.jp/pro/toukei/group/jinkou/jinkou.htm |archive-date = January 18, 2008}}</ref>

Nara prefecture had the highest rate in Japan of people commuting outbound for work, at 30.9% in 2000. A similar tendency is seen in prefectures such as [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]], [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]], and [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]], all three of them having over 20% of people commuting for other prefectures.<ref name="100indices"/>

==Culture==
[[File:NaraTodaijiStatue0214.jpg|thumb|Statue at Tōdai-ji]]
The culture of Nara is tied to the Kansai region in which it is located. However, like each of the other prefectures of Kansai, Nara has unique aspects to its culture, parts of which stem from its long history dating back to the Nara period.

===Dialect===
There are large differences in dialect between the north/central region of the prefecture, where Nara city is located, and the Okunoya district in the south. The north/central dialect is close to Osaka's dialect, whilst Okunoya's dialect favours a Tokyo-style accent. The lengthening of vowel sounds in the Okunoya dialect is unseen in other dialects of the [[Kinki region]], making it a special feature.

===Food culture===
Foods particular to Nara Prefecture include:
*{{ill|Chagayu|ja|茶粥}}, a [[rice congee|rice porridge]] made with green tea
*{{ill|Kakinoha zushi|ja|柿の葉寿司}}, sushi wrapped in [[persimmon]] leaves
*{{ill|Meharizushi|ja|めはり寿司}}, [[rice ball]]s wrapped in pickled ''[[Brassica juncea|takana]]'' leaves
*Miwa [[sōmen]], a type of wheat noodle
*[[Kasuzuke|Narazuke]], a method of pickling vegetables

==Tourism==
Many [[Jinja (shrine)|jinja]] (Shinto shrines), Buddhist temples, and [[kofun]] exist in Nara Prefecture, making it is a centre for tourism. Moreover, many [[world heritage]] sites, such as the temple [[Tōdai-ji]] and [[Kasuga Shrine]], exist in the capital city of Nara.  <!--Although there is also world heritage always open, there is world heritage which is temporarily exhibited by a limited time offer. The festival (matsuri) in connection with a temple and its area is performed.--> <!--I commented out two sentences that need to be rewritten.  I can't figure out if the second (festival) sentence is related to the first (limited time) here or not.  Either way, they may be more appropriate for the travel wiki than the encyclopedia-->
