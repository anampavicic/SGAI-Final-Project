'''Perm Krai''' ({{langx|ru|Пе́рмский край|Permsky kray}}, {{IPA|ru|ˈpʲɛrmskʲɪj ˈkraj|IPA}}; {{Langx|koi|Перем ладор|Perem lador}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (a [[Krais of Russia|krai]]), located in [[Eastern Europe]]. Its [[administrative center]] is [[Perm, Russia|Perm]]. The population of the krai was 2,532,405 ([[2021 Russian census|2021 Census]]).

The krai was formed on 1 December 2005 as a result of the 2004 [[referendum]] on the merger of [[Perm Oblast]] and [[Komi-Permyak Autonomous Okrug]].<ref name="fkz1-2004">{{cite web |url=https://rg.ru/2004/03/26/perm-dok.html |title=Федеральный закон об образовании Пермского края |trans-title=Federal Law on Formation of the Perm Territory |publisher=Rossiyskaya Gazeta |language=ru |access-date=28 January 2020 |archive-date=28 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200928165157/https://rg.ru/2004/03/26/perm-dok.html}}</ref> Komi-Permyak Okrug retained its autonomous status within Perm Krai during the transitional period of 2006–2008. It also retained a budget separate from that of the krai, keeping all federal transfers. Starting in 2009, Komi-Permyak Okrug's budget became subject to the budgeting law of Perm Krai. The transitional period was implemented in part because Komi-Permyak Okrug relied heavily on federal subsidies, and an abrupt cut would have been detrimental to its economy.

==Geography==
Perm Krai is located to the east of the [[East European Plain]] and the western slope of the Middle [[Ural Mountains]]. 99.8% of its area is in Europe, 0.2% in Asia. The maximum length from north to south is 645 km, from west to east — almost 420 km. The borders of the region are winding and have a length of more than 2.2 thousand km.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Назаров |first=Николай Николаевич |title=География Пермского края: учебное пособие |publisher=Пермский ун-т |year=2006 |edition=Ч.

The krai borders the [[Komi Republic]] in the north, [[Kirov Oblast]] in the northwest, the [[Udmurt Republic]] in the southwest, the [[Republic of Bashkortostan]] in the south, and [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] in the east.

The krai borders stretch for over {{convert|2200|km|mi}}. The highest point is Mount [[Tulymsky Kamen]] at {{convert|1496|m|ft}}.

===Minerals===
[[File:Salt dump in Solikamsk.jpg|right|thumb|Salt dump in [[Solikamsk]]]]
[[File:Kungur asv2019-05 img26 Ice Cave.jpg|right|thumb|[[Kungur Ice Cave]]]]

Perm Krai has an abundance of minerals. Oil, natural gas, gold, diamonds, chromites, peat, limestone and building materials are among the many natural resources extracted.<ref name="PK-Minerals">[http://www.perm.ru/region/geography/minerals/ Полезные ископаемые] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006054442/http://www.perm.ru/region/geography/minerals/ |date=6 October 2008 }}</ref>

Oil in its area was first discovered in 1929 near settlement Verhnechusovskie Gorodki. Currently there are more than 180 oil and gas fields known. Among them the developed ones are: 89 oil, 2 gas and 18 both oil and gas fields. Most of them are small and based in the central and southern districts of the krai. The northern fields are less developed because the oil lies deep under salt layers.

Coal has been mined in Perm Krai for more than 200 years. For a long time it played an important role in the fuel and energy balance in the region. Maximum mining was in 1960 when it reached 12 million tonnes. Mining then decreased and there are no exploration of new fields.

The Verkhnekamskoye deposit of potassium salts is one of the largest in the world. It is approx. {{cvt|1,800|km2}}, and the thickness of the salt layers reaches 514 m.

In 1841 the geological [[Permian|Permian Period]] was named after strata of rocks from that time were found in this area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Permian-Period|title=Permian Period &#124; Plants, Animals, Extinction, & Facts &#124; Britannica|website=www.britannica.com}}</ref>

===Flora and fauna===
Forests cover about 71% of Perm Krai's area. Coniferous  forests predominate, with deciduous forests more common in the south.
There are 62 species of mammals, more than 270 species of birds, 39 species of fishes, 6 species of reptile and 9 species of amphibians.{{citation needed|date=September 2021}}

Three nature reserves are located in Perm Krai: [[Basegi Nature Reserve|Basegi]], [[Vishera Nature Reserve|Vishera]], Preduralie.

==Politics==
[[File:Perm Krai Legislative Assembly.jpg|right|thumb|[[Perm Krai Legislative Assembly]]]]
During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Perm CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Perm Krai is the fundamental law of the region. The Legislative Assembly of Perm Krai is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

===Legislature===
Legislative power in the region is exercised by the [[Legislative Assembly of Perm Krai]], which consists of 60 deputies elected by the inhabitants of the Krai for a term of five years. 30 deputies are elected from party lists (proportional system), and the remaining 30 from single-member districts (majority system). To receive seats on party lists, parties must overcome the 5% threshold (for the first convocation - 7%). The first elections of deputies to the Legislative Assembly of the Perm Krai were held on 3 December 2006.

Party list places:
* [[:ru:Выборы в Законодательное собрание Пермского края (2006)|1st Convocation]] (2006): [[United Russia]] (12), [[Union of Right Forces]] (6), [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] (5), [[Russian Party of Pensioners for Social Justice|Russian Party of Pensioners]] (4), [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] (3);
* [[:ru:Выборы в Законодательное собрание Пермского края (2011)|2nd Convocation]] (2011): United Russia (14), CPRF (6), LDPR (5), [[A Just Russia]] (5);
* [[:ru:Выборы в Законодательное собрание Пермского края (2016)|3rd Convocation]] (2016): United Russia (16), CPRF (6), LDPR (5), A Just Russia (3);
* [[:ru:Выборы в Законодательное собрание Пермского края (2021)|4th Convocation]] (2021): United Russia (13), CPRF (9), A Just Russia (3), LDPR (3), [[New People (political party)|New People]] (2).

In single-mandate constituencies, the overwhelming majority always remained with the nominees of United Russia, with victory in 20, 25, 24 and 27 out of 30 constituencies, respectively.
