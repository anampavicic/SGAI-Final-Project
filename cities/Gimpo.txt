'''Gimpo''' ({{Korean|hangul=김포}}; {{IPA|ko|kim.pʰo}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in [[Gyeonggi-do|Gyeonggi]] Province, [[South Korea]]. It borders [[Incheon]], with which it shares the South Korean side of the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] estuary, as well as [[Seoul]] and the lesser cities of [[Paju]] and [[Goyang]]. [[North Korea]] is across the Han River. The current mayor is Jeong Hayoung ({{lang|ko|[[:ko:정하영|정하영]]}}). The city's population of more than 300,000<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gimpo-si (City, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/southkorea/admin/gyeonggi_do/31230__gimpo_si/|access-date=2020-09-28|website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> is made up of more than 71,000 households.

[[Gimpo International Airport]] (formerly Kimpo International Airport) used to be located inside the city, but is now part of [[Seoul]]. Tertiary educational institutions located in the city include [[Kimpo College]] and [[Joong-ang Seungga University]]. The city has 27 elementary schools, 12 middle schools, and 8 high schools, including [[Gimpo Foreign Language High School]]. Three elementary schools, two middle schools, and two high schools are located in the area of Tongjin.

==Modern history==
In 1914, Yangcheon County and Gimpo County were merged. Yangcheon County was separated into two towns (Yangdong and Yangseo).

Kimpo Airfield was constructed in 1939 during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese Imperial period]] for use by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. The airfield was a key asset during the [[Korean War]], changing hands three times before being recaptured and held by UN forces in February 1951 for the duration of the war. Designated K-14 by the [[United States Air Force]], it hosted several U.S. fighter, bomber, and reconnaissance units, notably [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86 Sabre]] which would engage in air combat in [[MiG Alley]] in the northwestern part of North Korea.

In 1958, the government decreed that the airfield would serve all commercial flights into Seoul, a role until then filled by [[Yeouido Airport]]. After the completion of the terminal at Gimpo, Yeouido was demolished.

In 1963, Yangdong and Yangseo towns were incorporated into [[Yeongdeungpo-gu]], which includes [[Gimpo International Airport]]. In 1973, Gyeyang and Ojeong towns of [[Bucheon]] were transferred to Gimpo. In 1989, parts of Gyeyang town were ceded to [[Incheon]], giving Incheon a border with southwestern Seoul. The Geomdan area was transferred to Incheon in 1995.

In 1998, Gimpo was promoted to a city (''si''). A major new development, the Gimpo Han River New Town, was announced in 2003, significantly increasing the population of the city since its construction. A two-car light rail system, the [[Gimpo Goldline]], opened in 2019 to improve transportation to the New Town and to encourage population growth. The line operates between [[Yangchon station]] and [[Gimpo International Airport station]], where transfers are available to [[AREX]], [[Korail]], and [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]] services.

==Climate==
Gimpo has a monsoon-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa'') with cold, dry winters and hot, rainy summers.
