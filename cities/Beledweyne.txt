==History==


There were battles in [[battle of Beledweyne (2006)|2006]], [[battle of Beledweyne (2008)|2008]], [[battle of Beledweyne (2010)|2010]] and [[battle of Beledweyne (2011)|2011]]. In December 2011, the Transitional Federal Government took control of Beledweyne from [[jihadist]] group [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]]. [[Military of Somalia|Somali National Army]] (SNA) soldiers and around 3,000 allied [[Ethiopian Army]] troops descended on the city, capturing it following several hours of fighting.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16372453 |title=Ethiopian troops capture Beledweyne from Somalia militants |work=[[BBC News]] |access-date=2011-12-31 |date=December 31, 2011 |archive-date=2011-12-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231173743/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-16372453 |url-status=live }}</ref> In October 2013, additional SNA and [[AMISOM]] troops were deployed to the town to firm up on security after al-Shabaab claimed responsibility for a suicide bomb attack at a local cafeteria.<ref>{{cite news|title=SOMALIA: Curfew begins in Beledweyn town a day after deadly suicide explosion|url=http://www.raxanreeb.com/2013/10/somalia-curfew-begins-in-beledweyn-town-a-day-after-deadly-suicide-explosion/|access-date=22 October 2013|newspaper=Raxanreeb|date=20 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022183710/http://www.raxanreeb.com/2013/10/somalia-curfew-begins-in-beledweyn-town-a-day-after-deadly-suicide-explosion/|archive-date=2013-10-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Municipality==
On May 7, 2012, Beledweyne held its first [[mayor]]al elections since the start of the civil war in the early 1990s. Two hundred delegates took part in the contest, which was overseen by the Hiran region's head of elections, Sadaq Omar Sabriye. [[Mohamed Hassan Nuriye]] emerged as the new city mayor, obtaining 135 votes versus 11 and 8 votes, respectively, for the two nearest competitors.<ref name="Bkbfgem">{{cite web|title=Beledweyne finally gets elected mayor|url=http://www.bar-kulan.com/2012/05/07/beledweyne-finally-gets-elected-mayor/|publisher=Bar-Kulan|access-date=1 July 2012|archive-date=5 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305004359/http://www.bar-kulan.com/2012/05/07/beledweyne-finally-gets-elected-mayor/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In his first day in office, Mayor Nuriye officially banned firearms within the city limits. He also warned that people found contravening the edict would have their weapons impounded and could face imprisonment. In addition, Nuriye indicated that for security reasons, government soldiers who were not on patrol should remain within their bases. Soldiers would likewise only be permitted to carry weapons in the city while conducting security operations.<ref name="Bknabmbfitc">{{cite web|title=Newly appointed Beledweyne mayor bans firearms in the city|url=http://www.bar-kulan.com/2012/05/08/newly-appointed-beledweyne-mayor-bans-firearms-in-the-city/|publisher=Bar-Kulan|access-date=1 July 2012|archive-date=26 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826113820/http://www.bar-kulan.com/2012/05/08/newly-appointed-beledweyne-mayor-bans-firearms-in-the-city/|url-status=live}}</ref>

To further tighten up on security, Beledweyne municipality over a three-day period started simultaneously registering all local residents.<ref name="Bknabmbfitc"/> Mayor Nuriye also unveiled plans for a citywide beautification campaign.<ref name="Bknabmbfitc"/> In July 2012, his administration imposed a two-day night-time curfew in Beledweyne, while government soldiers demolished structures that had been illegally erected along the area's main road in one of the Municipality's first [[urban renewal]] initiatives.<ref name="Bknciob">{{cite web|title=Nighttime curfew imposed on Beledweyne|url=http://www.bar-kulan.com/2012/07/19/nighttime-curfew-imposed-on-beledweyne/|publisher=Bar-kulan|access-date=31 July 2012|archive-date=2 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402182127/http://www.bar-kulan.com/2012/07/19/nighttime-curfew-imposed-on-beledweyne/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In March 2015, the Beledweyne municipality launched a civilian tax collection program in the city. The tax revenue is earmarked for essential public social services. Additionally, the city government is slated to register all local businesses, which will further facilitate tax gathering. The municipal authorities are also scheduled to set up a new citywide house numbering system.<ref name="Grobttpt">{{cite news|title=Residents of Baladweyne Told To Pay Taxes|url=http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=11839|access-date=16 March 2015|agency=Goobjoog|date=16 March 2015|archive-date=27 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327011110/http://goobjoog.com/english/?p=11839|url-status=live}}</ref>
