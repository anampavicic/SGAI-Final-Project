Pune at different points in time has been ruled by the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty]], [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]], the [[Mughals]], and the [[Adil Shahi dynasty]]. In the 18th century, the city was part of the [[Maratha Confederacy|Maratha Empire]], and the seat of the [[Peshwa]]s, the prime ministers of the Maratha Empire.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_shaniwarwada-was-centre-of-indian-politics-ninad-bedekar_1618983 |title=Shaniwarwada was centre of Indian politics: Ninad Bedekar |work=Daily News and Analysis |date=29 November 2011 |access-date=19 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120126173557/http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_shaniwarwada-was-centre-of-indian-politics-ninad-bedekar_1618983 |archive-date=26 January 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Pune was seized by the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] in the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]]; it gained [[Pune Municipal Corporation|municipal]] status in 1858, the year in which [[British Raj|Crown rule]] began.

Pune was a major centre of resistance to British Raj, with people like [[Gopal Krishna Gokhale]], [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] playing leading roles in [[Indian independence movement|struggle for Indian independence]] in their times.

==Etymology==
{{Further|Puneri}}
The earliest reference to Pune is an inscription on a [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty]] copper plate dated 937 CE, which refers to the town as Punya-Vishaya, meaning 'sacred news'.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|url=https://www.punediary.com/html/historyevents.html|title=India Maharashtra Pune History Event Of Pune Time Line Of Pune (Punediary.com)|website=Punediary.com|access-date=28 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180429092401/https://www.punediary.com/html/historyevents.html|archive-date=29 April 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> By the 13th century, it had come to be known as Punawadi.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.pune.org.uk/history.html |title = Pune History&nbsp;– Origin & History of Pune&nbsp;– History of Puna India&nbsp;– History of Pune City |publisher = Pune.org.uk |access-date = 16 July 2010 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100628003014/http://www.pune.org.uk/history.html |archive-date = 28 June 2010 |url-status = live }}</ref>

During the Rashtrakuta dynasty, the city was referred to as Punnaka and Punyapur. The copper plates of 758 and 768 CE show that the Yadava dynasty had renamed the city Punakavishaya and Punya Vishaya. 'Vishaya' means land, and 'Punaka' and 'Punya' mean holy. The city was known as Kasbe Pune when under the command of Maratha king [[Shivaji]]'s father, [[Shahaji]]. Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] renamed a small neighbourhood in central part of the old city as  Muhiyabad (the only divergent naming) some time between 1703 and 1705 in memory of his great-grandson Muhi-ul-Milan, who died there. The name Muhiyabad was reverted soon after Aurangzeb's death.<ref name="timesofindia-30Sep16"/> Anglicized to Poona in 1857 by the English during British rule, the city's name was changed to Pune in 1978.

=== Festivals ===
[[Ganesh Chaturthi]] is widely and publicly celebrated in Pune. [[Bal Gangadhar Tilak|Lokamanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak]] started the public celebration of the festival as a means to circumvent the colonial British government ban on Hindu gatherings through its anti-public assembly legislation in 1892.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Parvate|first=Trimbak Vishnu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqE9AAAAMAAJ|title=Bal Gangadhar Tilak: A Narrative and Interpretative Review of His Life, Career and Contemporary Events|date=1958|publisher=Navajivan Publishing House}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Roy|first=Christian|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IKqOUfqt4cIC&pg=PA178|title=Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-089-5}}</ref> Pandals with Ganesh idols are erected all across Pune. Many G''anesh'' ''mandals'' display live or figurine shows called ''Dekhava'' during the festival. These shows often carry socially relevant messages. Processions of Ganpati are accompanied by ''Dhol-Tasha pathaks'' (groups who play Dhol-Tasha percussion instruments). Involvement of these ''pathaks'' has become a cultural identity of Pune with there being over 150 such groups operating in and around Pune. [[Jnana Prabodhini]], a social organisation in Pune is widely accredited for founding the tradition of ''Dhol-Tasha'' ''pathaks''.<ref>{{Cite news|date=3 September 2017|first=Aishwarya|last=Upadhye|title=Dhol tasha pathaks, now and then|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/dhol-tasha-pathaks-now-then/articleshow/60343314.cms|access-date=5 September 2020|work=The Times of India|archive-date=25 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220325133159/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/dhol-tasha-pathaks-now-then/articleshow/60343314.cms|url-status=live}}</ref>

Pune is well-connected to other cities by [[National highways of India|Indian]] and state highways. [[National Highway 48 (India)|National Highway 48]] connects it to Mumbai and Bangalore, [[National Highway 65 (India)|National Highway 65]] connects it to [[Hyderabad]] and [[National Highway 60 (India)|National Highway 60]] connects it to [[Nashik]]. [[State Highway 27 (Maharashtra)|State Highway 27]] connect Pune to [[Ahmednagar]].

The [[Mumbai Pune Expressway]] is India's first six-lane high-speed expressway, and it was built in 2002. Only four wheeled vehicles are allowed on it. This expressway has reduced travel time between Pune and Mumbai to a little over two hours. A [[Pune Ring Road|ring road]] is planned around the city.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/centre-allocates-rs-2-468-crore-for-pune-s-ring-road-project/story-tNahKK43LCQee04O97xP4L.html|title=Centre allocates Rs.2,468 crore for Pune's ring road project|date=13 February 2018|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=6 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180507092206/https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/centre-allocates-rs-2-468-crore-for-pune-s-ring-road-project/story-tNahKK43LCQee04O97xP4L.html|archive-date=7 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/in-3-years-pmrda-has-transformed-pune-says-girish-bapat/story-NFfqiRdDn5ZdqUPkL5CghN.html|title=PMRDA has transformed Pune in three years, says Girish Bapat|date=10 April 2018|work=Hindustan Times|access-date=6 May 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180506173733/https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/in-3-years-pmrda-has-transformed-pune-says-girish-bapat/story-NFfqiRdDn5ZdqUPkL5CghN.html|archive-date=6 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/PCMC-grants-Rs-6-crore-for-ring-road-project/articleshow/30197.cms|title=PCMC grants Rs 6 crore for ring road project|date=19 June 2003|access-date=29 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526165850/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2003-06-19/pune/27218250_1_ring-road-development-plan-midc|archive-date=26 May 2013|work=[[The Times of India]]|url-status=live}}</ref>
