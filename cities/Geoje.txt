'''Geoje''' ({{Korean|hangul=거제}}; {{IPA|ko|kʌ̹.dʑe̞}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] located in [[South Gyeongsang]] province, just off the coast of the port city of [[Busan]], [[South Korea]]. [[Hanwha Ocean]] in Okpo and [[Samsung Heavy Industries]] (SHI) in Gohyeon are both located on Geoje Island. The city also offers a wide range of tourist sights. The city is made up of a number of islands, of which by far the largest is [[Geoje Island]]. There are multiple
[[dong (neighbourhood)|dong]] in the city: [[Jangpyeongdong]], [[Okpo-dong]] and [[Gohyeon]].

==Etymology==
'''Geoje''' is [[Korean language|Korean]] for "great rescue", from the syllables ''geo'' ({{korean|거|巨|}}) meaning great, and ''je'' ({{korean|제|濟|}}) meaning rescue.

==History==
Geoje has a history stretching back thousands of years.  Various artifacts dating back to the Neolithic era have been found at archaeological digs on Naedo, Sandaldo, and Isudo. While no written history can be found from this era, the digs show evidence of numerous small establishments along the coasts.  The first written mention of Geoje appears as, Geoje being one of two main divisions of the Dokro kingdom, a member of the Byeonhan confederacy (circa 0-300 AD). The Byeonhan confederacy slowly gave way to the Gaya confederacy(42-562 AD). The Gaya eventually submitted to the Kingdom of Silla.

In 757, [[Gyeongdeok of Silla]] classified the island as "Geoje-gun" "{{Korean|labels=no|거제[[Administrative divisions of South Korea|군]]}}" (Geoje [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|county]]). Modern Geoje is classified as a "si" ({{Korean|labels=no|[[List of cities in South Korea|시]]}}) ([[List of cities in South Korea|city]]). In 1170, [[Uijong of Goryeo]] secretly escaped to Geoje when [[Chŏng Chung-bu]] raised a rebellion against him, instating his brother, [[Myeongjong of Goryeo|Myeongjong]] as king. Geoje served as a strategic location in preparation of the naval forces for the [[Gihae Eastern Expedition]] ({{Korean|labels=no|기해동정}}) of [[Tsushima Island]] in 1419 by the Korean general [[Yi Jong Mu]]. At the time of the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Seven-Year War]] in 1592, admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]] gained a great naval victory against Japanese invaders near the town of Okpo in Geoje. Since then. Yi was referred to by his noble title, "Chung Mu Gong," which roughly translates into English as "Earner of Great National Respect."

In the [[Korean War]] (1950–53), the military government of [[General Douglas MacArthur]] used the island as a place for the settlement for 170,000 POWs, and a [[Geoje POW camp|Prisoner of war camp]] measuring at {{convert|11.8|km2|mi2}} was established during these years. The prison was rife with human rights abuses, including summary execution and the widespread use of torture against prisoners by Canadian and American troops. British journalist [[Alan Winnington]] and Australian journalist [[Wilfred Burchett]] conducted extensive research to document these human rights abuses, and jointly published their findings in 1952.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Burchett|first1=Wilfred|title=Koje Unscreened|last2=Winnington|first2=Alan|publisher=Britain-China Friendship Association|year=1953|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}</ref> After the war, a portion (23,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>) was converted into a tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitkorea.or.kr/eng/info_db/dest/sight_detail.jsp?seqno=4066 |title=KNTO Destination Guide - Geoje P.O.W.

During the last few decades Geoje has emerged as leader in the shipbuilding industries. Due to the continued industry, Geoje largely escaped the negative impacts of the Asian market crash of 1997.

Some notable people from Geoje include: 
*Former President [[Kim Young-sam]]
*Poet [[Yu Chi-hwan]], better known by his pen-name Cheongma.
*Former President [[Moon Jae-in]]

==Demographics==
According to the whitebook published by Geoje City in May 2014, Geoje had a population of 243,736, 12,240 of which are foreigners (non-Koreans). A significant portion of the population depends on shipbuilding to support their livelihood, and this can be evidenced by the fact that nearly 33%  of workers are employed in the shipbuilding industry.

==Tourism==
Geoje offers a variety of attractions, including Haegeumgang island, [[Oedo]], a marine western-style botanical garden in Hallyeo-Haesang National Park, built by Lee Chang-ho and his wife when they settled on the island in 1969.  Visitors visit by ferry boat from the harbor neighboring the islands.

Tourists also visit Jisim-do for trekking. Jisim is known for its Camellia vegetation. However, the Maemi typhoon in 2003 severely affected the island's plant life. Another popular tourist attraction at Haegeumgang-do (located southeast of Geoje) is the Sipja Donggul Cave. Buddhist and Shamanist sculptures can be found in the cave.

Geoje is the second largest island in Korea, so discovering these locations is most easily done using a tourist map.

==Geography==
Geoje city covers an area of {{convert|401.63|km2}}, encompassing Geoje-do ({{convert|383.44|km2}}) and 60 other small islets, of which 10 are inhabited.<ref>[http://i.b5z.net/i/u/1628001/i/Map_low_1.jpg Map of the region]</ref> The main island is joined to land by two bridges from nearby [[Tongyeong]]. It is also connected via a series of bridges and underwater tunnels to Gadeok (가덕), then [[Busan]] (부산), named the Geoga Great Bridge(거가대교).  A proposal has been made to connect Geoje to Masan(마산) by another set of bridges and tunnels named Yi Sun-sin Great Bridge (이순신대교).

===Climate===
Geoje experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa/Cwa''), and temperatures reaching below zero degrees Celsius in winter are frequent during December to February. However, the island is kept relatively warm by the influence of warm ocean currents.

On 2022, [[Typhoon Hinnamnor]] made landfall over the city, the eye centre directly passed over the city as a category 2 at 5:50 AM September 6, 2022. Leaving severe destruction around, including flooding.

==Produce==
Due to Geoje's coastal sub-tropical location, the area grows and harvests several different crops, some of which are uncommon in most of Korea. Some of these crops include yuja, pineapples, and mushrooms.

Being an island also provides an abundance of seafood that is collected locally.
