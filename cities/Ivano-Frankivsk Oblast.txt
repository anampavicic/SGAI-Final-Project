'''Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast''' ({{langx|uk|Івано-Франківська область|translit=Ivano-Frankivska oblast}}), also referred to as '''Ivano-Frankivshchyna''' ({{lang|uk|Івано-Франківщина}}) or simply '''Frankivshchyna''', is an [[administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblast]] (region) in [[western Ukraine]]. Its [[administrative center]] is the city of [[Ivano-Frankivsk]]. It has a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|1,351,822|punct=.}}

The area, also known as [[Prykarpattia]], was part of the historical region of [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], where the [[Kingdom of Galicia–Volhynia]] flourished. After [[World War I]], the area became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] and was administered as part of [[Stanisławów Voivodeship]] until the [[invasion of Poland]]. The area was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] and was known as '''Stanislav Oblast''' until 1962, when its administrative center was renamed after the Ukrainian writer [[Ivan Franko]]. [[Kolomyia]] was a historical center of the oblast and remains a major cultural center of [[Pokuttia]], the traditional name for the southern part of the oblast.

==Name==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2022}}
On November 9, 1962, a decree was issued by the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the UkrSSR, according to which: "Taking into account the wishes of the labor collectives of the city and region, the Presidium of the Verkhovna Rada of the USSR decided to rename the city of Stanislav (Stanislaviv) to Ivano-Frankivsk, and the Stanislav Oblast to Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast." The renaming was timed to the 300th anniversary of the city's founding and in honor of the outstanding Ukrainian writer [[Ivan Franko]].

As with the rest of Ukraine's oblasts Ivano-Frankivsk may also be known by its matronymical name ''Ivano-Frankivshchyna (''{{langx|uk|Івано-Франківщина}}). However, that name did not receive general public acceptance and commonly Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is almost always called ''[[Prykarpattia]]'' (en. Prekarpathians) – a historic name for the same region. (Geographically the historic region covers a much larger portion of Ukraine than just the Ivano-Frankivsk region.) Formerly as '''Stanislavshchyna''' or '''Stanyslavivshchyna''' – {{langx|uk|Станіславщина, Станиславівщина}}.

==Geography==
Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast borders [[Lviv Oblast]] to its north and west, [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] to its south-west, has a 50-km long state border with [[Romania]] ([[Maramureș County]]) to its immediate south, and it borders [[Chernivtsi Oblast]] to the south-east and [[Ternopil Oblast]] to the east. It is situated partly in the [[East European Plain|Eastern European Plain]] and partly [[Eastern Carpathian Foothills|Carpathian Foothills]]. The oblast may be divided into three regions: mountainous, pre-mountainous, and plains.

The climate is mildly-continental and damp with cool summers and mild winters. The average monthly temperature in June is {{convert|18|C|F|0}} with {{convert|12|to|16|C|F|0}} in the mountains. The average monthly temperature in January is {{convert|-4|C|F|0}} with {{convert|-6|C|F|0}} in the mountains. Average precipitation varies annually around {{convert|650|mm|1|abbr=on}} with {{convert|1550|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the mountains.

===Relief===
{{see also|Divisions of the Carpathians}}
[[File:Ukraine geology.png|300px|thumb|Geology of Ukraine]]
The region is situated between two main regional tectonic plates: Carpathian fold belt and Volhynia-Podillya plate. The most prominent features of the first one are the [[Carpathian Mountains]], while the second one - [[Dniester]] river.

The Carpathian Mountains contribute tremendously to the change in relief of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast and their elevation rises from north-east to south-west stretching along the oblast's south-western border. The elevation of the oblast varies from 230 m (755 ft) to 2,061 m (6,762 ft) [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The mountains occupy almost one half of the whole Oblast and consist of two main mountain ranges: the [[Gorgany]] (highest peak – Mt. Syvulia Major (1,836 m / 6024 ft)) and the [[Chornohora]] range (highest peak – Mt. [[Hoverla]] (2,061 m / 6,762 ft).

The rest of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is located within the [[Dniester|Dniester river]] and [[Prut|Prut river]] valleys. The plains of the oblast are part of the [[Carpathian Foothills (Ukraine)|Carpathian Foothills]] and [[Opillia Upland]] (part of [[Podolian Upland|Podillia Upland]]) which are cut through by [[Dniester]]. The [[Highland (geography)|upland]] has a temperate-climate habitat mixed with [[grassland]] and [[woodland]] – also known as the [[forest steppe]]. The relief of the region consists mostly of [[rolling hill]]s of 230-400 m (755-1312 ft) over the sea level. Near river valleys are common [[canyon]]s and [[ravine]]s.

A particular feature of the southern region of the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is Stanislav Canyon, in the so-called Kherson Mountains, a deep cut in the local topography where episodic water flowing into the Baltic has steeply eroded a canyon formation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://find-way.com.ua/en/regions/kherson-region/kherson-mountains-of-baidiha-canyon-stanislav |title=Stanislav Canyon (Kherson Mountains) |access-date=22 March 2022 |website=find-way.com.ua}}</ref>

{{main|Opillia Upland}}
The Dniester flows mainly through the [[Halych Raion]] and along the administrative border between Ivano-Frankivsk and [[Ternopil Oblast]]s. The territory of the region within immediate proximity to the river is traditionally known as ''Opillia''. Opillia, however, stretches far beyond the oblast and only covers two of its raions: [[Halych Raion]] and [[Rohatyn Raion]], both located in the north. Relief in the area consists of rolling hills uplands.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

{{main|Carpathian Foothills (Ukraine)}}
The Carpathian foothills consist mostly of low denudation accumulative uplands, while the right bank of Dniester along the border with the [[Ternopil Oblast]] depicts [[karst]] type relief of [[Pokuttia Upland]]. Because of it near that area along [[Dniester]] relief shows forms of [[canyon]]. Pokuttia Upland between [[Bystrytsia of Nadvirna]] and [[Prut River]] (Prut-Bystrytsia Upland) serves as drainage divide within the oblast between Dniester and Prut. Carpathian foothills have two depressions: one is at the confluence of [[Bystrytsia Solotvynska]], [[Bystrytsia Nadvirnianska]], [[Vorona River (Bystrytsia)|Vorona]] and [[Bystrytsia River|Bystrytsia]] rivers, called Bystrytsia Depression, and another is around the city of [[Kalush, Ukraine|Kalush]], called Kalush Depression.

===Hydrology===

Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast has a plethora of rivers, waterfalls, mountainous brooks, and smaller ponds, but there is almost no other type of bodies of water such as lakes and water reservoirs. Most of rivers either flow into [[Dniester]] or [[Prut River]] (tributary of [[Danube]]). The total water drainage area of the region is {{convert|13900|km²|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Segments of Dniester and [[Cheremosh River]] are used as administrative borders with [[Ternopil Oblast|Ternopil]] and [[Chernivtsi Oblast|Chernivtsi]] oblasts respectfully.

The water drainage divide between Dniester and Prut cuts the region through middle of following districts: [[Nadvirna Raion]], [[Kolomyia Raion]], [[Tlumach Raion]], and [[Horodenka Raion]].

===Nature Reserves===
The region is a home to some 456 preserved areas (on June 1, 2006) of some {{convert|195,633|ha|acre|abbr=on}}, 30 out of which are of all-national importance with an area of {{convert|108,742|ha|acre|abbr=on}} and the rest of a local importance.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.orada.if.ua/fileadmin/documents/Programi/215-9.pdf |title=Tourism in the Ivano-Frankivsk Region (government website) |access-date=2011-03-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007161332/http://www.orada.if.ua/fileadmin/documents/Programi/215-9.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is located a strict [[Gorgany Nature Reserve|nature reserve Gorgany]] that was created in 1996. There are five [[national park]]s in the region. There are numerous natural monuments of feature and habitat management areas ([[Zakaznik|zakaznyks]]).

==Government==
{{see also|Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast local election, 2010}}
The government in the region is headed by the chairman of the regional state administration (for simplicity sake - governor) appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]]. The governor appoints his deputies forming his regional governing cabinet to supervise the government policies in the region. Aside of the state administration the region has its own council that is headed by its chairman. The composition of the council depends on the popular vote in the region, while the chairman is elected within the elected council.
;Regional State Administration
Regional State Administration consists of the chairman and his deputies (5) supported by the "aparat" of the administration. Within the administration are numerous departments, each of them headed by a chief of department. The Ivano-Frankivsk Region State Administration has 17 departments and other government institutions such as the Children Service, regional state archives, and others.

===Primary divisions (pre-reform)===
The Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast was administratively subdivided into 14 [[district]]s ([[raions]]) as well as 6 cities ([[municipality|municipalities]]) which represented a separate raion and in direct subordination to the regional government, among which are [[Bolekhiv]], [[Kalush, Ukraine|Kalush]], [[Kolomyia]], [[Yaremche]], and the administrative center of the region, [[Ivano-Frankivsk]]. [[Burshtyn]] became the 6th city of regional importance in 2014. The formation of the region was established in 1921 in the [[Second Polish Republic]] and was in majority preserved during the Soviet times. Most of the districts (former powiats) were reestablished as well in 1960s. The major industrial and cultural centers of the region were given a wider form of autonomy and assigned as the cities of regional subordination.

===Secondary divisions===
====City municipalities (councils)/mayors====
The oblast has 15 cities which are (alphabetical order): [[Bolekhiv]], [[Burshtyn]], [[Dolyna]], [[Halych]], [[Horodenka]], [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], [[Kalush, Ukraine|Kalush]], [[Kolomyia]], [[Kosiv]], [[Nadvirna]], [[Rohatyn]], [[Sniatyn]], [[Tlumach]], [[Tysmenytsia]], and [[Yaremche]]. Five of those cities are of regional importance and the other ten are of district importance. All cities have its own council and mayor that represent a local form of self-government allowed by the laws on local administration and the [[Constitution of Ukraine]]. City municipalities of the region are independent from any district administration.

====Town municipalities (councils)====
Within the region there are 24 urbanized settlements (towns) which are a special settlement classification inherited from the Soviet municipal organization. Three of those towns serve as administrative centers of their respective districts. Each town has its own council that along with surrounding village councils compose a district administration which has its own executive branch, District State Administration, appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]]. Towns do not have a mayoral office and their head of the council serves as the main representative of the whole settlement.

====Village municipalities (councils)====
All other settlements in the region are considered rural and accounted for some 765 localities including villages and 20 selyshches (smaller villages) which are administered by 477 village councils. Some village municipalities consist of several villages, while others are a single-village municipality. There are several villages that are part of city municipalities such as Ivano-Frankivsk, Bolekhiv, and Yaremcha, while all others are spread out across the districts of the region.

===Historical overview of subdivisions===
When on November 27, 1939, the Soviet regime was established in [[Stanisławów Voivodeship]], the Polish administrative division of it was kept almost the same until January 17, 1940. Only two powiats Stryj and Żydaczów were transferred away.

On December 4, 1939, the voivodeship was officially renamed into Stanislav Oblast. In 1940 the oblast was redivided into 37 raions and two municipalities (cities of oblast subordination). The administrative centers of the former raions were following settlements: Bohorodchany (town), Bolekhiv (city), Bilshivtsi (town), Bukachivtsi (village), Burshtyn (town), Voinylov (village), Vyhoda (village), Halych (town), Hvizdets (town), Horodenka (town), Delyatyn (town), Dolyna (city), [[Verkhovyna|Zhabie]] (village), [[Yezupil|Zhovten]] (town), Zabolotiv (town), Kalush (city), Kolomyia (city), Korshiv (village), Kosiv (city), Kuty (town), Lanchyn (town), Lysets (town), Nadvirna (city), Novytsia (village), Obertyn (town), Otynia (town), Pechenizhyn (town), Rohatyn (city), Rozhniativ (town), Sniatyn (city), Solotvyn (town), Stanislav (city), Tlumach (city), Tysmenytsia (town), Chernelytsia (town), Yabluniv (town), Yaremcha (village). Two municipalities were cities of Stanislav and Kolomyia. On November 11, 1940, Deliatyn Raion was liquidated. On November 16, 1940, Novytsia Raion was re-administrated under town of [[Perehinske]].

During the World War II the region was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany]] (see [[Operation Barbarossa]]). Along with Lviv, Drohobych and Tarnopil oblasts, it was reorganized on August 1, 1941, into [[Distrikt Galizien]] centered in Lemberg and annexed to the [[General Government]]. The area of the former Stanislav Oblast was divided into three kreis (counties): Kalusz, Stanislau, and Kolomea. On July 27, 1944, the region was liberated from the [[Nazi Germany]] by the [[Soviet Army]] (see [[Lvov–Sandomierz Offensive]]).

The administrative division of Stanislav Oblast was reinstated and confirmed on January 1, 1947, with the same 36 raions and two municipalities as their existed before the war. Several settlements, however, had their status elevated. The status of a town obtained Bukachivtsi, Vyhoda, and Yaremcha, while Halych and Horodenka became recognized as cities. The next major changes in the region took place in the late 1950s. In 1957 five raions were liquidated: Vyhoda, Zhovten, Kuty, Pechenizhyn, and Chernelytsia. Then another five were liquidated in 1959: Bukachivtsi, Korshiv, Perehinske, Solotvyn, and Stanislav. On December 30, 1962, within the oblast was created the Verkhovyna Industrial Raion, centered in a town of Verkhovyna.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://uapravo.net/akty/postanowa-main/akt8phny1h.htm |title=Про утворення промислових районів і віднесення деяких міст республіки до категорії міст обласного підпорядкування |access-date=2010-12-20 |archive-date=2011-07-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724114451/http://uapravo.net/akty/postanowa-main/akt8phny1h.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On October 28, 1963, another major change took place when raions of the oblast were re-administered into the six rural raions, one – industrial, and two municipalities. There were the following administrative centers: Bohorodchany, Halych, Horodenka, Kalush, Kolomyia, Kosiv, Dolyna (municipalities – Ivano-Frankivsk (new name) and Kolomyia). On January 4, 1965, Dolyna Industrial Raion Raion was redesigned into the regular raion, while five other previous raions were recreated: Nadvirna, Rohatyn, Rozhniativ, Sniatyn, and Tlumach. On December 8, 1966, there were created Verkhovyna and Ivano-Frankivsk raions. That was the last major re-administration of the oblast.

On March 20, 1972, in the city of Kalush was created a municipality and it became a city of oblast subordination. On December 30, 1977, the same thing happened to Yaremcha status of which was elevated as well. On March 28, 1982, the Ivano-Frankivsk Raion was re-administrated under the Tysmenytsia Raion. On October 21, 1993, the city of Bolekhiv became of an oblast subordination with its own municipality. On December 14, 2006, Yaremcha was renamed into Yaremche.

Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast is home of numerous cultural festivals. There are numerous natural and architectural benchmarks that are scattered throughout the region.

One of the famous festivals is the Ukrainian International festival of [[ethnic music]] and [[land art]] "Sheshory" that usually takes place in the picturesque [[Hutsul]] village of the [[Kosiv Raion]] Sheshory since 2003.<ref>[http://sheshory.ua/index.html Shehsory festival] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809063723/http://sheshory.ua/index.html |date=2011-08-09 }} {{in lang|uk}}</ref> From 2007, however the festival has spread throughout the country taking place in [[Podolia]], [[Kyiv Oblast]], and other places. In August 2010 the village of Spas in the [[Kolomyia Raion]] hosted a culinary event ''Smachny Spas'' in association with "Sheshory", while in July of the same year another eco-cultural event ''[[Trypilske kolo]]'' in the [[Rzhyschiv]] city of [[Kyiv region]].

The city of [[Ivano-Frankivsk]] hosts several other festivals such as the All-Ukrainian festival of art collectives "Carpathian Spring" that takes place every May. Every two year the festival of modern art "Impreza" takes place every other year. Every odd year the city hosts the festival national-patriotic music and poetry "Freedom". Since May 2001 every year the city of Ivano-Frankivsk is the capital of the European blacksmith movement hosting the "Festival of blacksmith" and the art exhibition "Ornamental Forging" that takes place at the Mickewicz Square and neighboring Andrii Sheptytsky Square in city's [[old town]].

On the territory of Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast are located numerous monuments of architectural heritage. On February 8, 1994, near the city of [[Halych]] was established the National preserve of Ancient Halych.<ref>[http://www.davniyhalych.if.ua/ Офіційний сайт заповідника Ancient Halych] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100116131839/http://www.davniyhalych.if.ua/ |date=2010-01-16 }}</ref> Among other important sites in the region is the Church of the Holy Spirit located in the city of [[Rohatyn]] as well as the [[Manyava Skete|Maniava Skete]]. Near the village of Maniava in [[Ivano-Frankivsk Raion]]. The oblast also accounts for some number of various wooden churches of [[Boykos]] and [[Hutsuls]] traditional architecture.

In the [[Kalush Raion]] (western part of the region) visitors can find the Carpathian Train that still uses a [[narrow gauge railway]] system. Train is used for its direct purpose transporting wood as well as for a tourist recreation. The biggest benchmark of the region is the [[Hoverla]] mountain, the tallest in the nation. However, due to increased touristic activities in the post-Soviet times the mountain is a subject to a high degree of pollution. No less interesting destination serve the [[Dovbush rocks]] that are located near the city of [[Bolekhiv]] in mountains. That location was a base of an anti-Polish Peasant movement. Near the [[Manyava Skete|Maniava Skete]] is located the highest waterfall in [[Ukraine]], the [[Maniava waterfall]] (20&nbsp;m). In the same [[Bohorodchany Raion]] visitors may find the local [[mud volcano]] located near the village of [[Starunia]]. It was noticed for the first time in 1977 after an earthquake that took place in [[Romania]].
