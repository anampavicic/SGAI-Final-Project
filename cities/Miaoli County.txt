'''Miaoli County''' ([[Taiwanese Mandarin|Mandarin]] [[Hànyǔ Pīnyīn|Pinyin]]: ''miáo lì xiàn'';<ref name="ml"/> [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] [[Pha̍k-fa-sṳ|PFS]]: ''Mèu-li̍t-yen''; [[Hokkien]] [[Pe̍h-ōe-jī|POJ]]: ''Biâu-le̍k-koān'' or ''Miâu-le̍k-koān'') is a [[county (Taiwan)|county]] in western [[Taiwan]]. Miaoli is bordered by [[Hsinchu County]] and [[Hsinchu City]] to the north, [[Taichung]] to the south, and the [[Taiwan Strait]] to the west. Miaoli is [[Regions of Taiwan|classified]] as "central Taiwan" by the [[National Development Council (Taiwan)|National Development Council]] and "northern Taiwan" by the Taiwan [[Central Weather Bureau]]. [[Miaoli City]] is the capital of the county, and is also known as "Mountain Town", owing to the number of mountains nearby, making it a destination for hiking.

==Name==
The name ''Miaoli'' was coined by matching [[Hakka Chinese]] sound for the characters 貓貍 to the phonetically approximate ''Pali'' (''Bari'') from the [[Taokas language]]. The resulting word ({{lang|zh|貓狸}}) is a widespread but non-orthodox variant referring to [[Viverridae]]. In 1889, during late [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing rule]], the name was modified from various forms ({{lang|zh|貓裏, 貓裡, 貓里}}) to its current form.

==History==
Evidence of settlement in Miaoli dates back a thousand years. Many archaeological artifacts have been found showing that during the prehistoric era, people lived in the [[Fluvial terrace|river terrace]]. They mainly led an agriculture life and engaged in hunting and fishing for their extra food source. About a thousand years ago, an indigenous group Taokas settled here.

In the mid-17th century, [[Han Chinese]] began to migrate into the area, beginning a gradual process of deforestation and establishment of permanent settlement sites. Most inhabitants of Miaoli assimilated into the dominant Han population or migrated deeper into the mountainous range. After several hundred years, Miaoli had become the home of people from different origins, such as [[Hakka people|Hakka]], [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]], [[Atayal people|Atayal]] and [[Saisiyat people|Saisiyat]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miaoli.gov.tw/eng/1-1.php|title=About Miaoli – Miaoli County Government|work=miaoli.gov.tw|access-date=30 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121231013048/http://www.miaoli.gov.tw/eng/1-1.php|archive-date=31 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Kingdom of Tungning===
After [[Koxinga]] took over Taiwan from the [[Dutch Formosa|Netherlands]], he placed Miaoli in ''Tian-Sing County'' ([[:zh:天興縣|天興縣]]) and started an immigration plan to develop this area.

===Qing Dynasty===
After the last Tungning Ruler [[Zheng Keshuang]] surrendered to the [[Taiwan under Qing rule|Qing Dynasty]], Tian-sing County was renamed [[Zhuluo County]]. In 1889, Miaoli Hsien ([[:zh:苗栗縣 (清朝)|苗栗縣]]) was established as an independent county under [[Taiwan Prefecture]]. At the end of the 19th century, thousands of acres of high-quality fertile fields had been reclaimed in the area of [[Nanzhuang, Miaoli|Nanzhuang]], [[Shitan, Miaoli|Shitan]], [[Dahu, Miaoli|Dahu]] and [[Zhuolan, Miaoli|Zhuolan]]. Public and private schools were also established all over Miaoli which made the area a place of gathering intellectuals and elites in northern Taiwan.

===Empire of Japan===
The county was at first eliminated [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|under Japanese Imperial rule]]. {{nihongo||苗栗庁|Byōritsu-chō|lead=yes}} existed from ca. 1901 to 1908, but was split over {{nihongo4||新竹庁|Shinchiku-chō}} and {{nihongo4||台中庁|Taichū-chō}} in 1909. From 1920 to 1945, {{nihongo4|Byōritsu town|苗栗街}}, {{nihongo4|Enri town|苑裡街}} and six villages were under the jurisdiction of Byōritsu District, under [[Shinchiku Prefecture]].

===Republic of China===
After the [[Retrocession Day|handover of Taiwan from Japan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] on 25 October 1945, the present day area of Miaoli County was incorporated to [[Hsinchu County]]. On 16 August 1950, the government re-established '''Miaoli county''' with [[Miaoli|Miaoli Township]] as the [[county seat]]. On 25 December 1981, Miaoli Township was upgraded from [[Township (Taiwan)|township]] to a [[county-administered city]].<ref>{{cite news|date=1 February 2011|url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6187|title=Rezoning Taiwan|publisher=Taiwan Today|access-date=9 December 2020}}</ref>
