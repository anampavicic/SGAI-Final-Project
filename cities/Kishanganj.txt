==History==
Kishanganj, which was previously part of [[Purnia district]], is part of the [[Mithila (region)|Mithila region]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0hbA4A--9HcC&pg=PA74|title=Women Empowerment Through Panchayati Raj Institutions|first=Minni|last=Thakur|date=22 July 2018|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=9788180696800|via=Google Books}}</ref>

Mithila first gained prominence after being settled by [[Indo-Aryan peoples]] who established the [[Mithila Kingdom]] (also called Kingdom of the Videha).<ref name="Witzel">{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Witzel |authorlink=Michael Witzel |date=1989 |title=Tracing the Vedic dialects in Dialectes Dans Les litteratures Indo-Aryennes |editor1-last=Caillat |editor1-first=C. |publisher=Fondation Hugot |location=Paris |pages=13, 17 116–124, 141–143}}</ref>
