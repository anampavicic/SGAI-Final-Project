'''Vancouver''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=EN-Vancouver.ogg|v|æ|n|ˈ|k|uː|v|ər}} {{respell|van|KOO|vər}}) is a city on the north bank of the [[Columbia River]] in the U.S. state of [[Washington (state)|Washington]], located in [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]]. Founded in 1825 and incorporated in 1857, Vancouver had a population of 190,915 as of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]],<ref name="2020 Census (City)">{{cite web|title=Explore Census Data |url=https://data.census.gov/profile/Vancouver_city,_Washington?g=160XX00US5374060 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=December 6, 2023}}</ref> making it the fourth-most populous city in Washington state. Vancouver is the [[county seat|seat of government]] of [[Clark County, Washington|Clark County]] and forms part of the [[Portland metropolitan area|Portland-Vancouver metropolitan area]], the 25th-largest metropolitan area in the United States. Originally established in 1825 around [[Fort Vancouver]], a [[fur trading|fur-trading]] outpost, the city is located on the Washington–Oregon border along the [[Columbia River]], directly north of [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]].

==Etymology==
Vancouver shares its name with the larger city of [[Vancouver]] in southern [[British Columbia]], Canada, approximately {{convert|300|mi|km}} to the north. Both cities were named after British sea captain [[George Vancouver]], but the U.S. city is older. Vancouver, British Columbia, was incorporated 29 years after the incorporation of Vancouver, Washington, and more than 60 years after the name Vancouver was first used in reference to the historic [[Fort Vancouver]] trading post on the Columbia River. City officials have periodically suggested changing the U.S. city's name to Fort Vancouver to reduce confusion with its larger and better-known northern neighbor. Many [[Pacific Northwest]] residents distinguish between the two cities by referring to the Canadian city as "Vancouver, B.C." and the United States city as "Vancouver, Washington", or "Vancouver, USA".<ref name="columbian_20180511_tourismrevenue" /><ref name="businesswire_20180206_" /><ref name="ajot_20180502_vancouverusa" /> Local nicknames include "Vantucky" (though this is often used as a derogatory term)<ref name="bloomberg_20120529_fisherstatetax" /><ref name="vanvoice_20090601_lincolnsbeardvantuckey" /><ref name="oregonian_20110517_cafevantuckyshirt" /><ref name="stumped_20110529_portlandneighborcities" /><ref name="columbian_20110605_vantuckyderogatory" /> and "The 'Couv(e)".<ref name="wweek_20070321_welcometothecouve" />

==History==

===Early settlements and exploration===
The Vancouver area was inhabited by several Native American tribes, most recently the [[Chinookan|Chinook]] and [[Klickitat tribe|Klickitat]] nations, with permanent settlements of [[timber]] longhouses.{{r|HOV-Natives}} The Chinookan and Klickitat names for the area were reportedly ''Skit-so-to-ho'' and ''Ala-si-kas,'' respectively, meaning "land of the mud-turtles".{{r|smithrgess_2001_chronology|oregonnativeson_1901_nativename}} First known European contact was made by [[William Robert Broughton]] in 1792,{{r|riverimages|ourhistory}} with approximately half of the indigenous population killed by [[smallpox]] before the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] arrived in the area in 1806.{{r|HOV-Natives}} Within another fifty years, other diseases such as [[measles]], [[malaria]] and [[influenza]] had reduced the [[Chinookan]] population from an estimated 80,000 "to a few dozen refugees, landless, slaveless and swindled out of a treaty".{{r|HOV-Natives}}

===19th-century beginnings===
[[File:Fort Vancouver1859.jpg|thumb|left|[[Fort Vancouver]] in 1859]]
[[Meriwether Lewis]] wrote that the Vancouver area was "the only desired situation for settlement west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]". The first permanent European settlement did not occur until 1824, when Fort Vancouver was established as a fur trading post of the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. From that time on, the area was settled by both the US and Britain under a "joint occupation" agreement. Joint occupation led to the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] and ended on June 15, 1846, with the signing of the [[Oregon Treaty]], which gave the United States full control of the area. Before 1845, American Henry Williamson laid out a large claim west of the Hudson's Bay Company (including part of the present-day Port of Vancouver), called Vancouver City and properly registered his claim at the U.S. courthouse in Oregon City, before leaving for California.{{r|jollata}}{{rp|42}} In 1848, Williamson had it surveyed and platted by [[Peter Crawford (land surveyor)|Peter Crawford]]. In 1850, Amos Short traced over the claim of Williamson and named the town Columbia City.{{r|dahp_20140330_vancouversurveyor}} It changed to Vancouver in 1855. The City of Vancouver was incorporated on January 23, 1857.{{r|historylink_20090807_vancouvernamehistory}}

Based on an act of the 1859–60 legislature, Vancouver was briefly the capital of [[Washington Territory]], before capital status was returned to [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]] by a 2–1 ruling of the territorial supreme court, in accordance with [[Isaac Stevens]]' preference and concern that proximity to the border with Oregon might give some of the state's influence away to Oregon.{{r|columbian_2006ish_capitoldispute|historylink_20030115_capitoldispute|wasenate_2005_honorolympia}}

===20th century===
[[File:Manufacturing opportunities in the state of Washington (1918) (14782578282).jpg|thumb|Wooden shipyard in Vancouver, 1918]]
The neighborhood of Sifton was the terminus of an early electric [[Tram|trolley]] operated by the Northcoast Power Company that also served nearby [[Orchards, Washington|Orchards]] from 1910 until 1926. The trolleys made ten stops and ran once per hour, charging 15 cents each way. A mural in the heart of Orchards depicts the trolley and the rural character of the area at the time it was operating. The community was named after Doctor Sifton, a promoter of the trolley service.{{r|origin}}

According to the archives of the Vancouver ''[[The Columbian|Columbian]]'' newspaper, the Orchards-Sifton route ran along Vancouver's Main Street to 26th Street (renamed Fourth Plain Blvd.), then from 26th to K Street and thence north to 33rd Street. From there, it ran on 33rd over Burnt Bridge Creek and past the city limits. At that point the trolley became more like a regular train as it followed a cut through the wilderness. Few houses were seen between Vancouver and Orchards. The public's growing preference for motor cars in the 1920s heralded the end of the trolley.

Separated from Oregon until 1917, when the new [[Interstate Bridge]] began to replace ferries, Vancouver had three shipyards just downstream which produced ships for [[World War I]] before [[World War II]] brought an enormous economic boom. An [[Alcoa]] aluminum plant opened on September 2, 1940, using inexpensive power from the nearby [[New Deal]] hydropower turbines at [[Bonneville Dam]]. After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, [[Henry J. Kaiser|Henry Kaiser]] opened a [[Kaiser Shipyards|shipyard]] next to the U.S. Army base, which by 1944 employed as many as 36,000 people in a twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week production of [[Liberty ships]], [[Landing Ship, Tank|landing ship tanks]], and [[Casablanca-class escort carrier|escort carriers]]. This influx of shipyard workers boosted the population from 18,000 to over 80,000 in just a few months, leading to the creation of the Vancouver Housing Authority and six new [[tract housing|residential developments]]: Fruit Valley, Fourth Plain Village, Bagley Downs, Ogden Meadows, Burton Homes and McLoughlin Heights. Each of these was later incorporated into the city, and are well-known neighborhoods, while the neighboring "shipyard city" of [[Vanport, Oregon]], would be destroyed by the [[Memorial Day]] flood of 1948.{{Citation needed|reason=Need sources for lack of bridge with Oregon until 1917, 1940 aluminum plant, and WWII boom towns|date=November 2019}}

Vancouver has experienced conflicts with other Clark County communities because of rapid growth in the area. {{Citation needed|reason=Need sources for the claim that Vancouver has come into conflict with other places in Clark county, and when 'recently' has this happened.|date=June 2023}} The city's first annexation more than doubled its size in 1909, with the largest annexation of 1997 adding {{convert|11258|acre|km2}} and 58,171 residents.{{r|cityofvancouver_2006ish_annexationhistory}} As a result of urban growth and the 1997 annexation, Vancouver is often thought of as split between two areas, {{Citation needed|reason=We have no idea who believes this, please add a citation.|date=June 2023}} East and West Vancouver, divided by NE Andresen Road. West Vancouver is home to downtown Vancouver and most of the more historical parts of the city, as well as recent high-density mixed-use development. East Vancouver includes the communities of Cascade Park East and West, which had populations of 6,996 and 6,956 in 1990, before annexation.

===21st century===
More than one-third of the Vancouver urban area's population lives in unincorporated urban areas north of the city limits, including the communities of [[Hazel Dell, Washington|Hazel Dell]], [[Felida, Washington|Felida]], [[Orchards, Washington|Orchards]] and [[Salmon Creek, Washington|Salmon Creek]]. If county leaders had approved another major annexation plan in 2006, Vancouver would have surpassed [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]] and [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]] to become the state's second-largest city.{{r|komotv_20051223_annexation}}

===Military presence===
During 1852–54, future United States President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], then a captain in the U.S. Army, was [[quartermaster]] at what was then known as Columbia Barracks. Soon after leaving Vancouver, Grant resigned from the army and did not serve again until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861. Other notable generals to have served in Vancouver include [[George B. McClellan]], [[Philip Sheridan]], [[Oliver O. Howard]] and 1953 Nobel Peace Prize recipient [[George C. Marshall]].{{r|cityofvancouver_2007ish_150thanniversary}}

Army presence in Vancouver was very strong, as the Department of the Columbia built and moved to [[Vancouver Barracks]], the military reservation for which stretched from the river to what is currently Fourth Plain Boulevard and was the largest Army base in the region until surpassed by [[Fort Lewis (Washington)|Fort Lewis]], {{convert|120|mi|km|-1}} to the north. Built on the old company gardens and skirmish range, Pearson Army Field (later [[Pearson Field]]) was a key facility, and at one point the [[United States Army Signal Corps|US Army Signal Corps]] operated the largest spruce cut-up plant in the world to provide much-needed wood for airplanes. Vancouver became the end point for two ultra-long flights from Moscow, [[USSR]], over the North Pole. The first of these flights was performed by [[Valery Chkalov]] in 1937 on a [[Tupolev ANT-25]]RD airplane. Chkalov was originally scheduled to land at an airstrip on [[Swan Island (Oregon)|Swan Island]] in nearby [[Portland, Oregon]], but was redirected at the last minute to Vancouver's Pearson Airfield. In June 1975, a monument was dedicated commemorating the event near State Highway 14, then moved to the north side of Pearson Field in 1987. Chkalov Drive, in east Vancouver, was named in his honor.

==Geography==
[[File:Interstate Bridge and Columbia River.jpg|thumb|[[Columbia River]] waterfront]]
[[File:VancouverWA1888.png|thumb|upright|Vancouver map, 1888]]
Vancouver is located just north of the [[Columbia River]] and the [[Oregon]] border, just west of where the [[Columbia River Gorge]] bisects the volcanic [[Cascade Range]] and just east of where the [[Willamette River]] enters the Columbia. The city of Vancouver is in the Western Lowlands region of Washington. When clouds do not blanket the Puget–Willamette trough formed by the Cascade and [[Oregon Coast Range|Coast Range]], [[Mount Hood]], [[Mount St. Helens]], [[Mount Rainier]], [[Mount Jefferson (Oregon)|Mount Jefferson]] and [[Mount Adams (Washington)|Mount Adams]] are all visible from Vancouver.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{cvt|49.86|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{cvt|46.46|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{cvt|3.4|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files" />

===Climate===
Vancouver lies just north of Portland, Oregon, with which it shares a similar climate. Both are classified as warm-summer Mediterranean (Csb) on the [[Köppen climate classification]], but with certain key differences. High pressures east of the [[Cascade Range]] create something of a [[venturi effect]], leading to cold east winds down the Columbia River Gorge. Unsheltered by the [[Willamette Valley]], Vancouver has historically seen colder temperatures, including "silver thaw" storms where freezing rain cakes limbs and power lines. Such storms can paralyze Vancouver. This occasionally freezes the river, and in 1916 cut electric power in the city for almost two weeks. Rainfall occurs frequently throughout the fall, winter, and spring, but ceases around the middle of June, with dry and warm weather lasting through September. Average annual precipitation is {{cvt|42|in|mm}}. Heavy snowfalls are infrequent and snow often falls and doesn't stick, with major snowstorms only occurring every 2–4 years. Close proximity to the river was also a concern for flooding, before dams constricted the river, destroying features such as [[Celilo Falls]]. Periodic floods have been a nuisance, with two of the most destructive occurring in June 1894 and May 1948. The [[1948 Columbia River flood]] almost topped the Interstate Bridge's support piers and completely destroyed nearby [[Vanport, Oregon]]. Other unusual storms include the [[Columbus Day Storm of 1962]] and an [[1972 Portland–Vancouver tornado|April 5, 1972, tornado]] which rated F3 on the [[Fujita scale]], striking a local school. An EF1 tornado struck on [[Tornado outbreak sequence of January 7–11, 2008|January 10, 2008]], just after noon, causing moderate damage along a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on|spell=in}} path from [[Vancouver Lake]] to the unincorporated Hazel Dell area.{{citation needed|reason=Need sources for various climate events mentioned|date=November 2019}}

Because many Vancouver residents work in Portland, there is typically significant rush-hour traffic congestion on two bridges that cross the Columbia River – the [[Interstate Bridge]] and the [[Glenn Jackson Bridge]]. In 2017 there were 297,932 weekday vehicle crossings on the two bridges.<ref name="swwrtc_2019_columbiariverbridgestats" />

==Economy==
{{More citations needed|date=May 2013}}
[[File:Aerial view of Vancouver, WA.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of city]]

The Vancouver economy is characterized by [[Border#Border economics|border economics]] with neighboring Portland, Oregon. The state of Washington levies no individual or corporate income taxes and levies a property tax below the national average and a sales tax above the national median.<ref name="taxfoundation_taxsumwa" /> The State of Oregon has even lower property taxes and no sales tax but one of the highest state income taxes.<ref name="taxfoundation_taxsumor" /> As a result, many Vancouver residents prefer to shop in neighboring Portland where they do not pay sales taxes,<ref name="pew_20120418_portlandwashtax" /> then live and work in Vancouver where they do not pay state income tax (though Washington residents who work in Oregon must pay Oregon income tax.) For the same reasons, the city is popular with retirees. Conversely, the city is less favored by students and young adults.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 2003, 70% of workers in Vancouver worked in Clark County. There is a risk in sales tax avoidance because Washington has a use tax due on all purchases made in Oregon that are then returned to Washington. Vancouver residents "shop at their own risk" when attempting to avoid the sales tax in Washington, although the rule is rarely, if ever, enforced{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} except for purchases requiring registration, such as motor vehicles.

The taxation and demographics of the area depresses the retail sector of Vancouver's economy.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} Oregon has stricter development laws to protect the timber industry;{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} therefore, Vancouver tends to attract a higher proportion of the region's sprawling development. The voting base also led to rejection of extension of Portland's light-rail system into the city for several years.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} In 2013, Washington transitioned away from being a [[Alcoholic beverage control state|control state]].

The economic history of Vancouver reflects the region. Moving from a salmon- and trade-based indigenous economy by the [[Chinookan|Chinook]] people, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] pioneered extractive industries such as the [[fur trade]] and timber. Subsistence agricultural gave way to market and export crops such as apples, strawberries and prunes. Largely bypassed by the railroad in the 1880s, when the Oregon Steam Navigation company would ferry trains across the river downstream from [[St. Helens, Oregon]] to [[Kalama, Washington]], early downtown development was focused around Washington Street (where ferries arrived), lumber and Vancouver Barracks activities such as a large spruce mill for manufacturing airplanes. A 1908 railroad [[swing bridge]] across the Columbia allowed greater industrial developments such as the Standifer Shipyard during the first world war.<ref name="Standifer History">{{cite news |url=https://www.columbian.com/news/2020/aug/09/clark-county-history-s-s-kineo-at-the-port-of-vancouver/ |title=Clark County History: S.S.

As the [[old-growth forest]]s were depleted and heavy industry left the United States, Vancouver's economy largely changed to high tech and service industry jobs, with many residents commuting to Portland. Vancouver contains the corporate headquarters for [[Nautilus, Inc.]], [[ZoomInfo]], [[Papa Murphy's Pizza]] and The Holland (parent company of the [[Burgerville]] restaurant chain).<ref name="vbjbol2007" />

The [[Port of Vancouver USA]] operates a port on the Columbia River, which separates [[Oregon]] to the south and [[Washington (state)|Washington]] to the north. It handles over 400 ocean-going vessels annually, as well as a number of barges which ply the river and its tributaries as far as [[Lewiston, Idaho]].

The Vancouver Energy project was a proposed crude oil transport hub in the Port of Vancouver USA. It was estimated to produce the equivalent of $1.6 billion in employment income during the terminal's construction and for its first 15 years of operation.<ref name="nlr_20140901_vancouverenergystudy" /> Vancouver Energy ended its bid to build the hub in February 2018 following Governor Jay Inslee's rejection of the project.<ref name="st_20180227_vancouverenergyend" />

===Downtown revitalization===

[[File:Clark County Historical Museum - Vancouver Washington.jpg|thumb|Clark County Historical Museum]]

In 1997, the city of Vancouver decided to dedicate the next 15–20 years to redeveloping and revitalizing the downtown core, west of I-5 and south of Evergreen Boulevard. The first projects started in the early 2000s with the construction of many tall [[Condominium (living space)|condominium]] structures around [[Esther Short Park]]. The most lauded outside investment was the construction of a [[Hilton Hotels|Hilton]] hotel directly across from the park.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}
The Downtown redevelopment of Vancouver continued after a slowdown during the 2009–2012 recession. Numerous projects began to rise up around the city core and as of mid-2020 more than three dozen projects with mid-rise or high-rise structures were completed, under construction, or proposed.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cityofvancouver.us/projects |title=Projects &#124; City of Vancouver Washington |website=www.cityofvancouver.us |access-date=June 14, 2020 |archive-date=June 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200627134658/https://www.cityofvancouver.us/projects |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://urbanlivinginthecouv.home.blog/urban-pipeline/ |title=Urban Pipeline |date=December 14, 2018 |access-date=June 14, 2020 |archive-date=September 26, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200926165638/https://urbanlivinginthecouv.home.blog/urban-pipeline/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

''[[The Columbian]]'' newspaper moved to a new seven-story office building adjacent to the Hilton in 2008. Two years later, ''The Columbian'' filed for [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy and the building defaulted to [[Bank of America]]. In June 2010, the City of Vancouver agreed to purchase the office building for use as a new city hall for $18.5 million, a fraction of the $41.5 million sale price the owners of The Columbian office building had been asking prior to filing for bankruptcy. In 2011, the city consolidated five separate buildings housing 300 employees into the new building, located at 415 W. 6th Street. The move saved the city approximately $1 million a year in facility lease and maintenance costs.<ref name="brettman" />

The Fort Vancouver Regional Library District opened a new library on C Street at Evergreen Boulevard in 2011. Future plans on C Street include a new [[Marriott International|Marriott]] hotel and roughly 250 new condominiums.

== Government ==
{{See also|List of mayors of Vancouver, Washington}}
Vancouver relies on a [[Council–manager government|council–manager form of government]] composed of seven city council members including a [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] mayor's office. The mayor and council members serve four year terms. As is common in council-manager municipal government, the council oversees legislative issues such as local ordnances, while executive and administrative leadership is carried out by a [[city manager]] hired by the council. Vancouver also serves as the seat of Clark County and its associated county manager and [[Clark County Council|council]].

==Arts and culture==
[[File:Kiggins Theatre-9.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kiggins Theatre]]]]

In the early 2000s, Vancouver began seeing a revitalization of the local arts scene and cultural events. In 2010 there was a movement among local artists to form cooperatives and meet with established local gallery owners for a monthly forum known as "Art Conversations". Many of Vancouver's art galleries are located in downtown Vancouver, and in 2014, the City Council formally designated an "Arts District" in the downtown core.<ref name="cityofvancouver_20140418_citycouncilartdistrict" />

The [[Kiggins Theatre]] located within the Downtown Vancouver Art District, was built in 1936 by architect Day Hillborn. It was named for J.P. Kiggins, an entrepreneur and politician who cut a swath through town in the early 20th century, serving as Vancouver's mayor for 15 non-consecutive years between 1908 and 1935. It was renovated and reopened in 2011 as an independent film and community event venue.

The Vancouver Symphony Orchestra first formed in the late 1970s. Conducted and directed by Dr. Salvadore Brotons, the Symphony regularly performs concerts.<ref name="vso_2019ish_history" />

===Annual events===
Every June since 2006, the Recycled Arts Festival held in Esther Short Park has featured the work of dozens of artists whose creations are made from at least 75% reused or recycled materials, along with live music and food.<ref name="columbian_20180622_recyclingart" />

Since the mid-1960s, Vancouver has hosted a [[Fourth of July]] [[fireworks]] display on the grounds of [[Fort Vancouver National Historic Site]] that draws many people to the city. The display routinely ran to 45 minutes, attracted up to 60,000 visitors and was broadcast on area television, one of the largest west of the Mississippi River. Due to the death of key organizer "Mister Fireworks" Jim Larson and economic conditions during the [[Great Recession]], the show was not held in 2009.<ref name="mrfireworks" /> A shorter, redesigned show debuted in 2010 and brought in approximately 35,000 people.<ref name="2010fireworks" /> As of 2019, The Historic Trust (formerly the "Fort Vancouver National Trust"<ref name="historictrust_2019ish_rebrand" />) continues to organize the fireworks event.<ref name="historictrust_2019_2020fireworks" /> The fireworks were not held in 2020 or 2021 due to COVID-19.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hale |first=Jamie |date=February 3, 2021 |title=Fort Vancouver fireworks canceled for 2021, the second year in a row |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/2021/02/fort-vancouver-fireworks-canceled-for-2021-the-second-year-in-a-row.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210709190217/https://www.oregonlive.com/entertainment/2021/02/fort-vancouver-fireworks-canceled-for-2021-the-second-year-in-a-row.html |archive-date=July 9, 2021 |access-date=July 7, 2021 |website=The Oregonian |language=en}}</ref>

4 Days of Aloha, also known as the Hawaiian Festival, takes place in late July in Esther Short Park, Clark College, and Fort Vancouver. Started in 2012 by "Aunty" Deva Yamashiro, a hula dancer and self-appointed cultural ambassador for Hawaii, the festival features live music, dance performances, craft workshops, and a celebration of Hawaiian food, arts, and culture.<ref name="columbian_20190726_hawaiianfestival" />

Late August features the [[Vancouver Wine and Jazz Festival]] in Esther Short Park, which brought 13,500 attendees in 2012 and which is considered the largest jazz festival in the [[Pacific Northwest]].<ref name="clarkcountylive_20110725_winejazzfest" /><ref name="columbian_20120827_winejazzfest" />

===Architecture and notable buildings===
{{see also|National Register of Historic Places listings in Clark County, Washington}}
[[File:Marshall House Officers Row.JPG|thumb|upright|The Marshall House in [[Officers Row]], built in 1886 and later named after [[George C. Marshall]]]]

[[Mother Joseph]] was one of the first architects in the region, and because of its relatively long history, Vancouver contains a variety of buildings.{{citation needed|reason=Need citation supporting Mother Joseph as architect.|date=November 2019}} Homes vary from [[Victorian architecture|Victorians]] and craftsman bungalows downtown, to small wartime [[tract housing]] and [[ranch-style house|ranch-styles]] mid-town, with rural styles and larger homes in the outer ring. In addition to the reconstructed [[Fort Vancouver]] at the [[Fort Vancouver National Historic Site]], the city was named one of the [[National Register of Historic Places]]' "Dozen Distinctive Destinations" for 2003.<ref name="swwa_2006ish_quickfacts" />

Other notable buildings in Vancouver include:
* The [[Covington House (Vancouver, Washington)|Covington House]] at 4201 Main Street, a [[log cabin]] and boarding school built 1846–1848
* [[Officers Row]], including the Grant House (first house on the Columbia Barracks) and the [[Queen Anne style architecture|Queen Anne]]-style 1866 Marshall House
* [[Mother Joseph]]'s [[House of Providence (Vancouver, Washington)|Providence Academy]], dedicated in 1873, where Evergreen Boulevard crosses [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]]
* The [[Proto-Cathedral of St. James the Greater]] (formerly St. James Church) saw its first Roman Catholic Mass celebrated August 16, 1885
* The [[List of Carnegie libraries in Washington (state)|Carnegie library]] at Sixteenth and Main, which opened on New Year's Eve 1909, to showcase its unusual electric lights; it is now the site of the [[Clark County Historical Museum]]
* The 1914 [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago-style]] U.S. National Bank (now the Heritage Building) at sixth and Main
* The 1916 [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Post Office]] at 1211 Daniels Street
* The [[Vertical lift bridge|vertical-lift]] [[Interstate Bridge]], which opened on February 14, 1917, [[Oregon]]'s 58th anniversary
* The 1935 [[art deco]] telephone exchange building at Eleventh and Washington
* The 1941 Clark County Courthouse, designed by prolific local architect Day Hillborn
* Smith Tower, a round downtown apartment building for the elderly, built in 1965
* The Hilton Hotel and Vancouver Convention Center across from [[Esther Short Park]]

Many of these buildings have been repurposed. The 1867 Slocum House, an [[Italianate]] villa-style residence originally built one block south of its current location in [[Esther Short Park]], was moved to its present location in 1966 and now houses a winery and art gallery.<ref name="efs_deadlink" /> The Carnegie Library was expanded in the 1940s, becoming the [[Clark County Historical Museum]] after a new library was built in 1963. Other buildings have been torn down for urban renewal or renovated to house professional offices for lawyers and accountants.

Vancouver has two school districts: [[Vancouver Public Schools]] and [[Evergreen Public Schools|Evergreen School District]].

The Vancouver Public Schools cover most of west Vancouver and has seven high schools: [[Hudson's Bay High School]], [[Columbia River High School]], [[Fort Vancouver High School]], Vancouver Flex Academy, [[Skyview High School (Vancouver, Washington)|Skyview High School]], [[Vancouver School of Arts and Academics]], and [[Vancouver iTech Preparatory]] (grades 6–12).

===Colleges and universities===
* [[Clark College (Washington)|Clark College]] (two-year)
* [[Gateway Seminary]]
* [[Washington State University, Vancouver]]

==Media==
Vancouver is located within the Portland media market for print, radio, and television media. It does, however, serve as the hometown for some media, including ''[[The Columbian]]'', the Portland, Oregon newspaper ''[[The Oregonian]]'' that covers some southwest Washington news, and ''[[The Vancouver Voice]]'' which was southwest Washington's only alternative periodical for a time, and published from 2006 to 2011.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
{{see also|Port of Vancouver USA}}
[[File:C-Tran Gillig low-floor hybrid bus on Washington St in downtown (2017).jpg|thumb|Vancouver's [[public transit]] service is provided by [[C-Tran (Washington)|C-Tran]].]]

Vancouver has two interstate freeways, [[Interstate 5 in Washington|I-5]] and [[Interstate 205 (Oregon-Washington)|I-205]], both of which run north–south, across the [[Columbia River]] into Portland and toward [[Seattle]]. It also has two heavily travelled [[state highway]]s within the city limits. [[Washington State Route 14|SR 14]] begins at I-5 in downtown Vancouver and makes its way east. It is a freeway all the way until [[Camas, Washington|Camas]]. [[Washington State Route 500|SR 500]] begins from I-5 at 39th Street in north Vancouver, travels east connecting with I-205, and continues east into the suburb of Orchards where the freeway terminates at Fourth Plain Boulevard, and meets with the south end of north–south-oriented 117th Ave., [[Washington State Route 503|SR 503]]. A third state highway, [[Washington State Route 501|SR 501]], starts at I-5 and heads west through downtown and continues along a path that runs between the Columbia River and Vancouver Lake.

The area's mass transit system is [[C-Tran (Washington)|C-Tran]], the Clark County Public Transportation Benefit Area Authority, which operates 135 buses, vanpools, and paratransit vehicles. There are also a number of express routes into Portland's downtown.

There have been multiple discussions about extending Portland's [[Max Light Rail]] system into Vancouver. In 1995, Clark County voters rejected a ballot measure that would have funded a light rail extension north into Vancouver.{{r|oregonian_19950208_lightrailrejected}} Opposition to paying for light rail was strong at that time, but slowly declined over the following several years, eventually leading Vancouver officials to begin discussing the idea again.{{r|oregonian_20010326_lightrail|secondlook}} Meanwhile, [[TriMet]] reconstituted its planned MAX line to Vancouver as a shorter line running only within Portland, which could potentially be extended across the river and into Clark County at a later date. This extension of the MAX system opened in 2004 as the [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow Line]],{{r|makingtracks}} running as far north as the [[Portland Expo Center]], approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|0}} south of downtown Vancouver. In 2012, Vancouver voters rejected a sales tax proposal to fund light rail operations in connection with the [[Columbia River Crossing]] proposal.{{r|columbian_20121106_lightrailrejected}} In 2022, [[Interstate Bridge#Interstate Bridge Replacement Program (2019–present)|Interstate Bridge Replacement Program]] includes a new proposal for a light rail extension into downtown Vancouver.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phiel |first1=Shari |title=I-5 Bridge project preferred alternative includes 1 auxiliary lane each way, light rail |url=https://www.columbian.com/news/2022/may/05/i-5-bridge-project-preferred-alternative-includes-1-auxiliary-lane-each-way-light-rail/ |work=The Columbian |date=May 5, 2022}}</ref>

Vancouver has always been well served by rail; current freight railroads operating in Vancouver include the [[BNSF Railway|BNSF]], [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]], and the local shortline [[Lewis and Clark Railway]].  [[Amtrak]], the national passenger rail system, provides service to [[Vancouver station (Washington)|Vancouver Station]]. The long-distance ''[[Coast Starlight]]'' and ''[[Empire Builder]]'' serve the city, as well as the regional [[Amtrak Cascades|Amtrak ''Cascades'']].

[[Pearson Field]], located near downtown Vancouver, is the main airport serving the city. The airport is intended primarily for general aviation without any commercial air service. The nearest commercial airport is [[Portland International Airport]] (PDX).

In 2008, Vancouver passed a citywide law requiring anyone on a wheeled device such as a bicycle, skateboard, scooter or skates to wear a helmet while on any sidewalk, street, trail or other public property. Many local cyclists opposed the law as a misuse of city funds and police efforts, as well as an encroachment on personal freedoms. Despite opposition from the public, the Vancouver City Council passed the measure 5–1 with then Mayor Royce Pollard saying, "...statistics be damned. I support this."{{r|bikeportland_20080225_helmetlaw|columbian_20080226_helmetlaw}}
