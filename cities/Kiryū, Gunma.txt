==History==
Kiryū is located within traditional [[Kōzuke Province]] and has been noted since the [[Nara period]] for production of fabrics. The place name appears in the [[Kamakura period]] ''[[Azuma Kagami]]''. During the [[Edo period]], most of the area of present-day Kiryū was part of the ''[[tenryō]]'' holding under the direct administration of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], with the exception of the commercial center and temple town of Kiryū-shinmachi, noted for [[sericulture]] since the Nara period, which was part of [[Shōnai Domain]] of [[Dewa Province]]. The area also prospered from its location on the Kiryū and Watarase rivers.

Kiryū Town was created within [[Yamada District, Gunma]] Prefecture on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. It was raised to city status on March 1, 1921. Kiryū annexed the neighboring village of Sakaino on April 1, 1933 and village of Hirosawa on April 1, 1937. The city expanded further with the annexation of Umeda, Aioi and part of Kawauchi village on October 1, 1954.[[File:Kiryu city.jpg|thumb|View of Kiryū from the south looking north]]
On June 13, 2005, Kiryū absorbed the villages of [[Niisato, Gunma|Niisato]] and [[Kurohone, Gunma|Kurohone]] (both from [[Seta District, Gunma|Seta District]]).

==Government==
Kiryū has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 22 members. Kiryū contributes three members to the Gunma Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Gunma 1st district]] and the [[Gunma 2nd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Traditionally, Kiryū's principal industry was [[sericulture]] and silk textile manufacturing, with records dating silk production as far back as 713 AD. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}  [[Pachinko]] manufacturing arrived in Kiryū after [[World War II]], during the period of industrial reconstruction, with the formation of two main companies&mdash;the [[Heiwa Corporation]] in 1949, and the Sophia Corporation in 1951. Kiryū's factories are responsible for manufacturing 60% of Japan's pachinko machines. {{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}  However, the decreased demand for silk goods and the closure of several area manufacturing concerns have caused the local economy to suffer.

[[Mitsuba Corporation]], a major manufacturer of automotive parts is headquartered in the city.<ref>"[http://www.mitsuba.co.jp/english/company/base Head Quarter, Offices and Plants]." [[Mitsuba Corporation]]. Retrieved on August 20, 2014.</ref>

==Education==
Kiryū has 17 public elementary schools and ten public middle schools operated by the city government, and six public high schools operated by the Gunma Prefectural Board of Education. There are also two private middle schools and two private high schools.
The prefecture also operates three special education schools for the handicapped. The Engineering department of [[Gunma University]] is located in the Tenjin district of the city.
