During Soviet times, the city of Samara was renamed to '''Kuybyshev''' in 1935 in honor of the Russian Bolshevik, [[Valerian Kuybyshev]]. The city reverted to its historical name of Samara on 25 January 1991 where it remains to this day.

===Early history===
[[File:So0417 1904-08.jpg|thumb|Sobornaya Street and horse tram in 1905]]

Samara, together with its northern neighbour [[Kazan]], is at the centre of the [[Idel-Ural]] historical region. [[Ahmad ibn Fadlan]] visited the area that is now Samara around 921 while on his journey to the [[Volga Bulgars]] who then controlled the region from their capital [[Bolghar]].<ref name="DK2010">{{cite book|author=DK|title=Explorers: Tales of Endurance and Exploration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBSCZsQPE6YC&pg=PA33|date=20 September 2010|publisher=DK Publishing|isbn=978-0-7566-7511-0|page=33}}</ref>

Legend has it that [[Alexius, Metropolitan of Kiev]], later [[Patron saint|Patron Saint]] of Samara, visited the site of the city in 1357 and predicted that a great town would be erected there, and that the town would never be ravaged. The [[Volga River|Volga]] port of Samara appears on [[Italian language|Italian]] maps of the 14th century. Before 1586, the [[Samara Bend]] was a pirate nest. Lookouts would spot an oncoming boat and quickly cross to the other side of the peninsula whenever the pirates organized an attack. Officially, Samara started with a fortress built in 1586 at the [[confluence]] of the Volga and [[Samara River]]s.<ref name="O'Neal2015"/> This fortress was a frontier post protecting the then easternmost boundaries of Russia from forays of [[nomads]]. A local customs office was established in 1600.

As more and more ships pulled into Samara's port, the town turned into a centre for diplomatic and economic links between Russia and the East. Samara also opened its gates to peasant war rebels headed by [[Stepan Razin]] and [[Yemelyan Pugachyov]], welcoming them with traditional [[bread and salt]]. The town was visited by [[Peter the Great]] and later [[Tsar]]s.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Борсуков |first=Андрей |date=2013-07-09 |title=Юрий Смирнов: "Императоры всероссийские не обходили стороной Самарскую губернию" |url=https://volga.news/article/262990.html |access-date=2024-07-19 |website=Волга Ньюс}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=новостей |first=Служба |date=2021-04-22 |title=Романовы в Самаре: история императорских визитов в город |url=https://progorodsamara.ru/news/view/romanovy-v-samare-istoria-imperatorskih-vizitov-v-gorod?ysclid=lyscolpxjl905639567 |access-date=2024-07-19 |website=Про Город Самара |language=ru}}</ref>

In 1780, Samara was turned into an [[Uyezd|uyezd town]] of [[Simbirsk Governorate]] overseen by the local Governor-General, and Uyezd and Zemstvo Courts of Justice and a Board of Treasury were established. On January&nbsp;1, 1851, Samara became the centre of [[Samara Governorate]] with an estimated population of 20,000. This gave a stimulus to the development of the economic, political and cultural life of the community. Samara was outside of the [[Pale of Settlement]] and as such did not have any significant Jewish population until the late 19th century.<ref name="bh.org.il">{{cite web |last1=Vladimirsky |first1=Irena |title=The Jewish Community of Samara, Russia |url=https://www.bh.org.il/jewish-community-samara-russia/ |publisher=[[The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot]] |access-date=27 June 2018}}</ref> In 1877, during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russian-Turkish War]], a mission from the Samara city government [[Duma]] led by [[Petr Alabin]], as a symbol of spiritual solidarity, brought a banner tailored in Samara pierced with bullets and saturated with the blood of both Russians and Bulgarians, to Bulgaria, which has become a symbol of Russian-Bulgarian friendship.<ref>{{Cite web |title=В Самаре воссоздали одну из ключевых битв русско-турецкой войны 1877-1878 годов - ТАСС |url=https://tass.ru/obschestvo/6445407 |access-date=2024-07-19 |website=TACC |language=ru}}</ref>

===Soviet period===
{{More citations needed section|date=May 2020}}
In 1935, Samara was renamed Kuybyshev in honour of the Bolshevik leader [[Valerian Kuybyshev]].

During World War II, Kuybyshev was chosen to be the alternative capital of the Soviet Union should [[Moscow]] fall to the invading Germans, until the summer of 1943, when everything was moved back to Moscow. In October 1941, the Communist Party and governmental organisations, diplomatic missions of foreign countries, leading cultural establishments and their staff were evacuated to the city.<ref>Andrew Nagorski: ''The Greatest Battle'', 2007, pp. 165–166</ref> A dugout for [[Joseph Stalin]] known as "[[Stalin's bunker, Samara|Stalin's Bunker]]" was constructed but never used. To mark its role as wartime national capital a special Revolution Day parade was held at the city's [[Kuybyshev Square]] on November 7, 1941, and since 2011 has been remembered in an annual [[military parade]] organised by the city government.

As a leading industrial centre, Kuybyshev played a major role in arming the country. From the very first months of World War II the city supplied the front with aircraft, firearms, and ammunition. Health centres and most of the city's hospital facilities were turned into base hospitals. Polish and Czechoslovakian military units were formed on the territory of the Volga Military District. Samara's citizens also fought at the front, many of them volunteers.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

After the war the defence industry developed rapidly in Kuybyshev; existing facilities changed their profile and new factories were built, leading to Kuybyshev becoming a [[closed city]]. In 1960, Kuybyshev became the missile shield centre for the country. The launch vehicle [[Vostok (rocket family)|Vostok]], which delivered the first crewed spaceship to orbit, was built at the Samara [[Progress Rocket Space Centre|Progress Plant]]. [[Yuri Gagarin]], the first man to travel in space on April&nbsp;12, 1961, took a rest in Kuybyshev after returning to Earth. While there, he spoke to an improvised meeting of Progress workers. Kuybyshev enterprises played a leading role in the development of Soviet domestic aviation and the implementation of the Soviet space program. There is also an unusual monument situated in Samara commemorating an [[Ilyushin Il-2]] ground-attack aircraft assembled by Kuybyshev workers in late 1942. This particular plane was shot down in 1943 over Karelia, but the heavily wounded pilot, K. Kotlyarovsky, managed to crash-land the plane near Lake Oriyarvi. The aircraft was returned to Kuybyshev in 1975, and was placed on display at the intersection of two major roads as a symbol of the deeds of home front servicemen and air-force pilots during the [[Great Patriotic War (term)|Great Patriotic War]].

===Post-Soviet period===
[[File:Ladya Samara winter.JPG|thumb|Ladya apartment complex]]
[[File:Samara naber.JPG|thumb|The [[Volga River]] in Samara]]
In January 1991, the historical name of Samara was given back to the city. Samara is one of the major industrial cities of Russia and has a multiethnic population.<ref name="city.old.webzavod.ru" /> The city retains its leading positions in the region, mainly due to a number of oil and petrochemical enterprises. In September 2016, Samara was awarded the title "City of Labor and Combat Glory".

In 2018, Samara became one of the host cities of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]], the matches of which were held at the Samara Arena stadium.

On July 2, 2020, the title "[[City of Labour Valour|City of Labor Valor]]" was awarded to Samara. On December 10, 2021, the Memorial Complex was installed on the Alley of Labor Glory on the Young Pioneers Avenue. The central element of the memorial complex was a glass and metal stele about 26 meters high.

==Geography==
===Urban layout===
The development of the territory of modern Samara began in the 16th century with the foundation of the Samara fortress. Prior to the founding of the fortress, this area was home to piers for Volga ships. The official date of foundation of the settlement was the decree of Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich of 1586. The location of the town was predetermined by several factors: strategic placement in order to ensure security from the raids of nomadic tribes; expansion of the Russian state in the Middle and Lower Volga regions; convenient location in the steppe landscape, at the intersection of the Volga and Samarka rivers.<ref name="str1">Громилина Э. А., Самогоров В. А., Филиппов В. Д. Эволюция архитектурно-планировочной структуры Самары с конца XVIII по начало XXI веков // Innovative Project. — 2017. — Т. 2, № 3. — pp. 6—13.</ref>

The fortress was wooden with 11 towers, surrounded by a rampart and a moat, and occupied 5.2 hectares. Gradually, the population of the fortress increased, and the surrounding territories were developed.<ref name="str1"/> Simultaneously with the fortress in 1586, Boldyrskaya Sloboda arose on the Volga slope, and around 1645, upstream the Volga, Voznesenskaya Sloboda. During the 17th century, the settlements merged into a single whole.<ref name= "str2">Веретенников Д. Б. Генезис компонентов планировочной структуры Самары с 1586 до 90-х годов XX века // Вестник СГАСУ, Градостроительство и Архитектура. — 2015. — № 3 (20), pp. 13—21.</ref>

In 1688, the settlement received the status of a city, which required the development of the first boundary plan. It is known that by the beginning of the 18th century the city stretched in a narrow strip along the Volga slope. From 1703 to 1706, a new earthen, diamond-shaped form was built to the east of the old fortress. The layout was unsystematic, with small blocks of bizarre shapes. Almost the entire territory was occupied by residential buildings and administrative, commercial and military buildings were concentrated only in the fortress. The territories along the banks of the Volga and Samarka were occupied by marinas and barns. By 1717, there were 210 philistine houses and 17 houses of yasak peasants in Samara. The settlement grew slowly due to its border position and by the end of the 18th century it occupied 61.2 hectares of territory, compactly stretching along the banks of the Volga.<ref name="str1"/><ref name="str2"/>

[[image:Samara in 1886.png|left|thumb|200px|Samara city plan in 1886]]
In 1763, Empress Catherine II signed an order "On the making of all cities, their buildings and streets of special plans for each province especially." In the 70s, extensive activities were launched by the “Commission on the Stone Buildings of St. Petersburg and Moscow” to rebuild provincial cities. At the same time, the development of the first master plan for Samara began. In 1764, the settlement changed its administrative status, becoming a settlement. In 1780 it again received the status of a county town. In 1765 and 1772 it was badly damaged by fires. Despite these obstacles, in 1782 Samara received the first master plan with a rectangular grid of streets.
According to the plan, the territory of the city was subject to a complete redevelopment: all buildings were liquidated, with the exception of several churches, houses and a fortress. In 1796, a second reconstruction plan was drawn up, identical to the first. As a result of its implementation, by 1804 the territory of Samara had increased to 70.4 hectares. The basis for the planning of the northern part of the city was a rectangular quarter measuring 130 × 260 m. The southern part of the settlement retained its irregular character.<ref name="str2"/> The main type of building of this period is a low-rise estate. The directions of the streets were determined by the direction of the channel, the so-called Samara break. The city was divided into functional zones: residential areas with trade facilities, administrative and religious buildings. Community centers were located around churches and at the ship's pier. Forges were located on the outskirts of the city. The fortress occupied 3.6 hectares, divided into a residential zone, an administrative zone (offices, a prison, a storehouse), a public one (a court, a thought), a commercial, an industrial one (warehouses, piers, forges, barns).<ref name="str1"/>
In 1804, a new plan for the reconstruction and expansion of Samara was drawn up, following the model of the previous ones. The old buildings in the south of the city were demolished, and a regular layout appeared in its place. In 1839, the plan was almost completely implemented. The territory of Samara has increased by 3.5 times (246.4 ha). The city occupied the entire territory along the watershed of the Volga and Samara rivers, the banks of which were built up with marinas, grain barns, warehouses, and small-scale industries. The Samara fortress was still preserved, but had already lost its significance.<ref name="str2"/>

In 1840, a new development plan was approved, according to which the territory of the city expanded further along the watershed, while maintaining the planning structure.<ref name="str2"/> The new plan reflected the nature of the prevailing wooden buildings (stone houses accounted for only 10% of the total). The size of the quarters remained the same, the city grew at the expense of adjacent agricultural land. As a major trading center, with a railroad, Samara in 1851 received the status of a provincial city. The general plan of 1853 regulated only building within the city limits, however, the settlement began to grow chaotically, numerous industrial facilities appeared: tanneries, oil mills, brick factories and mills. The development of navigation along the Volga led to the fact that piers, warehouses, sawmills and other factories occupied the entire Volga coast of the city. From 1875 to 1877, a private railway to Orenburg was built through Samara, laid along the banks of the Samara River. The residential part of the city was cut off from the banks of the industrial rivers, with the exception of a small section of the Strukovsky Garden, overlooking the Volga. By the end of the 19th century, Samara was a single planning space with a regular plan (with the exception of the Zasamarskaya settlement, which arose no later than the end of the 18th century).<ref name="str2"/>

====1937 General plan – Greater Kuybyshev====
The rapid growth of Kuybyshev required the development of a new master plan "Big Kuibyshev" in 1937, which was designed for the future, until 1956. It provided for a significant expansion of the city, turning it into a major industrial center. The main compositional axes arose along the watershed of the Volga and Samara rivers, and the second axis - Novo-Sadovaya Street. The structure highlights the main urban centers: Samara Square and the area of the Botanical Garden. The existing historical buildings were renovated and redeveloped, old cemeteries and churches were demolished to accommodate new public and cultural facilities.<ref name="str1"/>
The outbreak of the Great Patriotic War prevented the full implementation of the plan. In the 1940s, large defense factories were evacuated to Kuibyshev, in connection with which the area of the city during the war and the first post-war years increased by 50%, amounting to 6651.3 hectares by the end of the 40s. Factories and factories were located along the railway, east of the old city, in empty areas. Between them and the old city, new residential areas arose. New construction also unfolded in other immediate outskirts and further in the periphery.<ref name="str2"/>

In 1949, a new general plan of Samara was adopted, according to which the transport system developed (the emergence of new highways), a new industrial and residential area of Bezymyanka was built, new territories were developed, new planning units appeared: microdistricts. The development of the city proceeded at an intensive pace: the Kirovsky district, the village of Kryazh, the mouth of the Dry Samarka were built up. Landscaping work was underway, the reconstruction of squares (Kuibyshev and Chapaev squares), the laying of the TsPKiO. A new urban framework was formed by community centers and main highways connecting remote areas with the historical center.<ref name="str1"/>
However, until the end of the 1950s, the city was a conglomeration of scattered workers' settlements, located around the largest industrial enterprises. In such a system, two centers were key: the Old City (historical merchant) and the new Bezymyanka industrial district (social city). Bezymyanka was connected with the Old Town by a railway line and bus routes. This two-part structure of the city lasted until the end of the 20th century.<ref name="ReferenceA">Самогоров В. А.

In the 1950s, during the construction process, the local architectural school was able to form outstanding architectural ensembles that connected the workers' settlements into a single urban system. These are the buildings of Revolution Square, Kuibyshev, Samarskaya, Chapaev, Agriculture, Kirov, Pobeda Street, Kirov, Metallurgists, Yunykh Pioneers, Kuibyshev, Novo-Sadovaya, Maslennikov, the Soviet Army and the Volga embankment.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>
