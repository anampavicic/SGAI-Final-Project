'''Newport''' ({{langx|cy|Casnewydd}} {{IPA|cy|kasˈnɛwɨð|}}) is a [[city]] and [[Principal areas of Wales|county borough]] in [[Wales]], situated on the [[River Usk]] close to its confluence with the [[Severn Estuary]], {{cvt|12|mi|km|abbr=off}} northeast of [[Cardiff]]. The population grew considerably between the 2011 and the [[2021 United Kingdom census|2021 census]], rising from 145,700 to 159,587,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nomisweb.co.uk/sources/census_2021/report?compare=W06000022|title = Custom report - Nomis - Official Labour Market Statistics}}</ref> the largest growth of any unitary authority in Wales.

Newport has been a port since medieval times when the first [[Newport Castle]] was built by the [[Normans]]. The town outgrew the earlier [[Roman Britain|Roman]] town of [[Caerleon]], immediately upstream and now part of the city. Newport gained its first [[Municipal charter|charter]] in 1314. It grew significantly in the 19th century when its port became the focus of [[Coal industry in Wales|coal exports]] from the eastern [[South Wales Valleys]]. Newport was the largest coal exporter in Wales until the rise of Cardiff in the mid-1800s. Newport was the site of the last large-scale armed insurrection in [[Great Britain]], the [[Newport Rising]] of 1839.

In the 20th century, the docks declined in importance, but Newport remained an important centre for [[manufacturing]] and [[engineering]]. Latterly its economy has been bolstered as part of the [[M4 corridor]] high-technology cluster. It was granted city status in 2002. The Celtic Manor Resort in Newport hosted the [[Ryder Cup]] in 2010 and was the venue for the [[2014 Wales summit|2014 NATO summit]]. The city contains extensive [[rural areas]] surrounding the [[Newport built-up area|built-up core]]. [[:Category:Villages in Newport, Wales|Its villages]] are of considerable archaeological importance. [[Newport Cathedral]] is the seat of the [[Anglican]] [[Bishop of Monmouth]] and is the cathedral of the [[Diocese of Monmouth]].

==Etymology==
The original Welsh name for the city was ''Casnewydd-ar-Wysg'' (pronounced {{IPA|cy|kasˈnɛwɪð ar ˈwɪsk|}}). This is a [[contraction (grammar)|contraction]] of the name ''Castell Newydd ar Wysg'', which translates as "new castle on the Usk". The Welsh name is recorded in the ''[[Brut y Tywysogion]]'' when it was visited by [[Henry II of England]] sometime around 1172. "New castle" suggests a pre-existing fortification in the vicinity and is most likely either to reference the ancient fort on Stow Hill, or a fort that occupied the site of the present castle.<ref name="Newport Past">{{cite web |url=http://www.newportpast.com/early/castle/ |title=Newport Castle |publisher=Newport Past |access-date=24 November 2020 |author=Bob Trett |archive-date=27 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127075913/http://www.newportpast.com/early/castle/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The English name 'Newport' is a later application. The settlement was first recorded by the Normans as ''novo burgus'' in 1126. This [[Latin]] name refers to the new borough (or town) established with the Norman castle.<ref name="encyclopedia">The Welsh Academy Encyclopedia of Wales. Cardiff: University of Wales Press 2008.</ref> The origin of the name ''Newport'' and the reason for its wide adoption remains the subject of debate. ''Newport-on-Usk'' is found on some early maps, and the name was in popular usage well before the development of [[Newport Docks]].<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Cambrian Archæological Association, 1859 |url=https://archive.org/details/archaeologiacam30moorgoog |title=Archæologia Cambrensis |access-date=27 September 2007 |year=1859}}</ref> One theory suggests that ''Newport'' gained favour with medieval maritime traders on the Usk, as it differentiated the "New port" from the "[[Isca Augusta|Old Roman port]]" at [[Caerleon]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Green |first1=Colin |title=The Port of Caerleon |url=http://www.caerleon.net/history/port/index.htm |website=Caerleon.net |access-date=23 November 2020 |archive-date=29 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929100951/http://www.caerleon.net/history/port/index.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==
{{main|Category:History of Newport, Wales}}

===Early history===
[[File:Newport Castle, Monmouthshire.jpeg|left|thumb|Newport Castle in 1784]]
[[Bronze Age]] fishermen settled around the fertile estuary of the River Usk and later the [[Celt]]ic [[Silures]] built [[hillfort]]s overlooking it.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZEUAQAAIAAJ&q=%22Bronze+Age%22+estuary+of+the+River+Usk |title=The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |publisher=[[University of Wales Press]] |author=Academi Gymreig |year=2008|isbn=978-0708319536 |page=610}}</ref> In AD 75, on the very edge of their empire, the [[Roman legion]]s built a [[Roman fort]] at [[Caerleon]] to defend the river crossing. According to legend, in the late 5th century Saint [[Gwynllyw]] (Woolos), the patron saint of Newport and King of [[Gwynllwg]] founded the [[Church (building)|church]] which would become [[Newport Cathedral]]. The church was certainly in existence by the 9th century and today has become the seat of the [[Bishop of Monmouth]]. In 1049/50, a fleet of Orkney Vikings, under Welsh king [[Gruffydd ap Llywelyn]], sailed up the Usk and sacked St Gwynllyw's church.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wade-Evans |first=Arthur .W. |title=Vitae Sanctorum Britanniae et Genealogiae) |publisher=University of Wales Press Board |year=1944 |location=Cardiff |pages=183}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Garmonsway |first=G.N. |title=The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle |publisher=J.M.

The original Newport Castle was a small [[motte-and-bailey]] castle in the park opposite Newport Cathedral. It was buried in rubble excavated from the Hillfield railway tunnels that were dug under Stow Hill in the 1840s and no part of it is currently visible.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Bob Trett, newportpast.com |url=http://www.newportpast.com/early/summary/ |title=A Summary of the Early History of Newport |access-date=1 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929162818/http://www.newportpast.com/early/summary/| archive-date=29 September 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Norman invasion and early modern Newport===

[[File:Newport Castle.jpg|left|thumb|[[Newport Castle]], on the west bank of the [[River Usk]]]]
Around the settlement, the new town grew to become Newport, obtaining its first charter in 1314<ref>{{cite book |url=http://welshjournals.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc-id:1044290/llgc-id:1044493/llgc-id:1044530/get650 |title=A History of Monmouthshire, Volume 5: The Hundred of Newport |last=Bradney |first=Joseph Alfred |publisher=South Wales Record Society |year=1993 |isbn=0950867675 |editor-last=Gray |editor-first=Madeleine |pages=23 |author-link=Joseph Bradney |access-date=9 May 2013 |archive-date=25 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525170930/http://welshjournals.llgc.org.uk/browse/viewpage/llgc-id:1044290/llgc-id:1044493/llgc-id:1044530/get650 |url-status=live }}<!-- Alternative ISBN 0-907158-62-5 --></ref> and was granted a second one, by [[Hugh Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford]] in 1385 (the Newport coat of arms reflects those of the Staffords: theirs was a red chevron - pointing upwards- on a gold field, Newport's is a red chevron reversed - pointing downward - on the same background.) In the 14th century Augustinian [[friars]] came to Newport where they built an isolation hospital for infectious diseases. After its closure the hospital lived on in the place name "[[Spytty Park|Spytty Fields]]" (a corruption of ''ysbyty'', the Welsh for hospital).<ref name="localhistories.org">{{cite web |publisher=Tim Lambert |url=http://www.localhistories.org/Newport.html |title=A Brief History of Newport |access-date=9 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011145313/http://localhistories.org/Newport.html |archive-date=11 October 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> "Austin Friars" also remains a street name in the city.

During the [[Glyndŵr Rising|Last War for Welsh Independence]] in 1402 [[Rhys Gethin]], General for [[Owain Glyndŵr]], forcibly took Newport Castle together with those at Cardiff, Llandaff, Abergavenny, Caerphilly, Caerleon and Usk.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=The Bull Inn, Caerleon, June 2007 |url=http://www.thebellatcaerleon.co.uk/info/glyndwr.htm |title=Owain Glyndwr, The Bell at Caerleon |access-date=9 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306204225/http://www.thebellatcaerleon.co.uk/info/glyndwr.htm |archive-date=6 March 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> During the raid the town of Newport was badly burned and Saint Woolos church destroyed.

A third charter, establishing the right of the town to run its own market and commerce came from [[Humphrey Stafford, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] in 1426. By 1521, Newport was described as having "....a good haven coming into it, well occupied with small crays [merchant ships] where a very great ship may resort and have good harbour." Trade was thriving with the nearby ports of [[Bristol]] and [[Bridgwater]] and industries included leather tanning, soap making and starch making.<ref name="localhistories.org"/> The town's craftsmen included bakers, butchers, brewers, carpenters and blacksmiths. A further charter was granted by [[James I of England|James I]] in 1623.

During the [[English Civil War]] in 1648 [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s troops camped overnight on [[Christchurch, Newport|Christchurch Hill]] overlooking the town before their attack on the castle the next day. A cannonball dug up from a garden in nearby Summerhill Avenue, dating from this time, now rests in [[Newport Museum]].<ref name="hando">{{cite book |last=Hando |first=Frederick James|author-link=Fred Hando |year=1958 |title=Out and About in Monmouthshire |publisher=R.

===Industrial Revolution===
[[File:Newport in Monmouthshire.jpeg|thumb|Newport, 1813]]
[[File:Westgate Hotel.jpg|thumb|The attack on the Chartists by the [[Westgate Hotel]], 4 November 1839]]

As the [[Industrial Revolution]] transformed Britain in the 19th century, the [[South Wales Valleys]] became key suppliers of [[coal]] from the [[South Wales Coalfield]], and [[iron]]. These were transported down local rivers and the new [[canals]] to ports such as Newport, and [[Newport Docks]] grew rapidly as a result. Newport became one of the largest towns in Wales and the focus for the new industrial eastern valleys of [[South Wales]]. By 1830 Newport was Wales' leading coal port, and until the 1850s it was larger than Cardiff.<ref name="encyclopedia"/>

The [[Newport Rising]] in 1839 was the last large-scale armed rebellion against authority in mainland Britain. [[John Frost (Chartist)|John Frost]] and 3,000 other [[Chartism|Chartists]] marched on the [[Westgate Hotel]] at the centre of the town, where chartists were being held prisoner, with some of the chartists being armed. Shooting began between the chartists and the [[45th Regiment of Foot]], which had been called to the town by the Mayor, Thomas Phillips, to assist the police.<ref name="Jones 151">{{cite book |last1=Jones |first1=David |title=The last rising : the Newport Chartist insurrection of 1839 |date=1999 |publisher=University of Wales Press |location=Cardiff |isbn=070831452X |pages=151 |url=https://archive.org/details/lastrisingnewpor0000jone_a9t4/page/150/mode/2up?q=westgate |access-date=15 September 2022}}</ref> At least 20 chartists were killed and were later buried in [[Newport Cathedral|Saint Woolos churchyard]]. Thomas Philips and three of those in the hotel were wounded. John Frost was sentenced to death for treason, but this was later commuted to [[penal transportation|transportation]] to Australia. He returned to Britain (but not to Newport) later in his life. [[John Frost Square]] (1977), in the centre of the city, is named in his honour.

Newport probably had a Welsh-speaking majority until the 1830s, but with a large influx of migrants from England and Ireland over the following decades, the town and the rest of Monmouthshire came to be seen as "un-Welsh", a view compounded by [[Monmouthshire (historic)#Ambiguity over Welsh status|ambiguity about the status of Monmouthshire]].<ref name="encyclopedia"/> In the 19th century, the St George Society of Newport (a group largely consisting of English settlers and businessmen) asserted that the town was part of England. It was at a meeting in Newport, attended by future Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]], that the [[Cymru Fydd]] movement received its death-blow in 1896 when politician [[Robert Bird (Welsh politician)|Robert Bird]] stated: "You will find, from Swansea to Newport, a cosmopolitan population who will not submit to the domination of Welsh ideas!".<ref name="encyclopedia"/> Lloyd George was to suffer a further blow in Newport, when the South Wales Liberal Federation, led by [[David Alfred Thomas]], an industrialist and Liberal politician, and Robert Bird moved that Lloyd George "be not heard" in the [[1895 United Kingdom general election|1895 General Election]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] capture of the recently created Newport constituency in a by-election in 1922 was one of the causes of the fall of his coalition government.<ref name="encyclopedia"/>

The late 19th and early 20th century period was a boom time for Newport. The Alexandra Docks opened in 1875. The population was expanding rapidly and the town became a [[county borough]] in 1891.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> In 1892 the Alexandra South Dock was opened and was the largest masonry dock in the world.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> Although coal exports from Newport were by now modest compared to the [[Cardiff Docks|Port of Cardiff]] (which included Cardiff, [[Penarth]] and [[Barry, Vale of Glamorgan|Barry]]), Newport was the place where the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|Miners' Federation of Great Britain]] was founded in 1889, and international trade was sufficiently large for 8 [[Consul (representative)|consuls]] and 14 vice-consuls to be based in the town.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> In 1898 Lysaght's [[Orb Works]] opened and by 1901 employed 3,000 staff. Urban expansion took in [[Pillgwenlly]] and [[Lliswerry]] to the south; this eventually necessitated a new crossing of the River Usk, which was provided by the [[Newport Transporter Bridge]] completed in 1906, described as "Newport's greatest treasure".<ref name="encyclopedia"/>

Further extensions to the South Dock were opened in 1907 and 1914. The Newport Docks Disaster occurred on 2 July 1909 when, during the construction of the new south lock connecting the South Dock to the [[Severn Estuary]], supporting timbers in an excavation trench collapsed and buried 46 workers. Rescuers included a 12-year-old paperboy, Thomas 'Toya' Lewis, who was small enough to crawl into the collapsed trench. He worked for two hours trying to free one of the trapped men, who was finally released the next day. A public subscription raised several hundred pounds and Lewis was sent on an engineering scholarship. He was also awarded the [[Albert Medal for Lifesaving]] by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]]. Memorials to the dead are in [[St Mark's Church, Newport|St Mark's Church]], close to the centre of the city. A pub in the city centre was named "The Tom Toya Lewis" in his honour, but closed in 2021.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/tom-toya-lewis-pub-docks-20067563 | title=City centre pub named after docks disaster hero up for sale again | date=11 March 2021 }}</ref> The building in which the pub was housed was formerly the Newport [[YMCA]], the foundation stone for which was laid by [[Godfrey Morgan, 1st Viscount Tredegar|Viscount Tredegar]] in 1909.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historypoints.org/index.php?page=the-tom-toya-lewis-newport |title=The Tom Toya Lewis, Newport |publisher=Historypoints |access-date=11 January 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/4469387.newport-docks-disaster-heros-example-still-shines-100-years-on/|first=Mike|last=Buckingham|title=Newport Docks Disaster hero's example still shines 100 years on|publisher=[[South Wales Argus]]|date=2 July 2009|access-date=11 January 2024}}</ref>

From 1893 the town was served by the [[paddle steamer]]s of [[P & A Campbell]] Ltd. (the "White Funnel Line"), which was based in Bristol. The company had originally been set up by the Scottish brothers Alex and Peter Campbell on the [[River Clyde]], but was re-located to the Severn Estuary. Departing steamers would face south on Davis Wharf, with the Art College to its left and the town bridge behind. The boats gave rise to the name of the short street which led to the quayside – Screwpacket Road. By 1955 steamers had stopped calling at Newport and P & A Campbell went into receivership in 1959. It was taken over by the firm which would become the [[European Ferries#Townsend Thoresen|Townsend Ferry]] group.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/features/the_long_view/14139386.when-steamers-sailed-into-the-heart-of-newport/ |title=When steamers sailed into the heart of Newport |website=South Wales Argus |date=11 December 2015 |access-date=17 March 2019 |archive-date=18 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221118033244/https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/14139386.when-the-white-funnel-steamers-of-pa-campbell-sailed-into-the-heart-of-newport/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Compared to many Welsh towns, Newport's economy had a broad base, with foundries, engineering works, a cattle market and shops that served much of Monmouthshire.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> However, the docks were in decline even before the [[Great Depression]], and local unemployment peaked at 34.7% in 1930: high, but not as bad as the levels seen in the mining towns of the [[South Wales Valleys]]. Despite the economic conditions, the council re-housed over half the population in the 1920s and 1930s.<ref name="encyclopedia"/> In 1930 the Town Dock was filled in.

The post-war years saw renewed prosperity, with Saint Woolos' Cathedral (now [[Newport Cathedral]]) attaining full cathedral status in 1949, the opening of the modern integrated [[Llanwern steelworks]] in 1962, and the construction of the [[Severn Bridge]] and local sections of the [[M4 motorway]] in the late 1960s, making Newport the best-connected place in Wales.<ref name="encyclopedia"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ukmotorwayarchive.org/ |title=The Motorway Archive: The M4 in Wales |access-date=22 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118211627/http://www.ukmotorwayarchive.org/ |archive-date=18 January 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> Although employment at Llanwern steelworks declined in the 1980s, the town acquired a range of new public sector employers, and a [[Richard Rogers]]–designed [[Inmos microprocessor factory]] helped to establish Newport as a centre for technology companies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.inmos.com/inmos_legacy.html |title=The Inmos Legacy |publisher=Inmos.com |access-date=22 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071020114452/http://inmos.com/inmos_legacy.html |archive-date=20 October 2007 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Governance and Politics==
:''See also [[:Category:Politics of Newport, Wales]]''
{{Main|Newport City Council}}
[[File:newportciviccentre.jpg|thumb|The [[Art Deco]] [[Newport Civic Centre]]]]
Newport has long been the largest town in the historic county of Monmouthshire and a [[county borough]] between 1891 and 1974. The [[Local Government Act 1972]] removed ambiguity about the legal status of the area by including the administrative county of Monmouthshire and the county borough of Newport into all acts pertaining to Wales. In 1974, the borough was incorporated into the new local government county of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]] until Newport became a [[unitary authority]] again in 1996. Gwent remains in use for ceremonial functions as a [[Preserved county of Wales|preserved county]].

Newport was historically [[Industrialisation|industrialised]] with a large [[working class]] population and strong support for the [[Welsh Labour|Labour Party]].<ref name="encyclopedia"/>

=== Council ===
[[Newport City Council]] consists of 53 elected councillors. The [[Welsh Labour|Labour Party]] won the [[2022 Newport City Council election]] with 35 seats, ahead of the [[Welsh Conservatives|Conservative Party]] with 7 seats.

The Labour Party lost control of Newport council in the [[2008 United Kingdom local elections|2008 local elections]] to a Conservative/[[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] coalition but the Labour Party regained an overall majority of councillors in the [[2012 United Kingdom local elections|2012 election]] until the present day.

=== Senedd ===
In the [[Senedd]] (Welsh Parliament), Newport is divided between the [[Senedd constituencies and electoral regions|Senedd constituencies]] of [[Newport East (Senedd constituency)|Newport East]] and [[Newport West (Senedd constituency)|Newport West]] and elects one [[Member of the Senedd]] (MS) in each constituency. In the [[2021 Senedd election]], the Labour Party retained both Newport East and Newport West.

In [[Senedd]] elections the Labour Party has held both the Newport East and Newport West constituencies since the constituencies were created in 1999.

=== UK Parliament ===
In UK General Elections the City of Newport is in two [[List of United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|UK Parliament constituencies]]. Due to boundary changes the Newport West constituency was renamed Newport West and Islwyn for the [[2024 United Kingdom general election]]. In 2024 the Labour Party won both the expanded [[Newport East (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport East]] constituency and the new [[Newport West and Islwyn (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport West and Islwyn]] constituency.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2023 Parliamentary Review - Revised Proposals {{!}} Boundary Commission for Wales |url=https://bcomm-wales.gov.uk/reviews/10-22/2023-parliamentary-review-revised-proposals |access-date=2023-06-20 |website=[[Boundary Commission for Wales]]}}</ref>

Until 2024 The City of Newport was divided between the UK Parliament constituencies of [[Newport East (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport East]] and [[Newport West (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport West]] and elected one [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) in each constituency. The Labour Party held [[Newport East (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport East]] since constituency boundaries were redrawn in 1983 and held [[Newport West (UK Parliament constituency)|Newport West]] since 1987.

The city formerly had only one constituency [[Newport (Monmouthshire) (UK Parliament constituency)]] until 1983 when the city was split into Newport East and Newport West due to population growth.

=== European Parliament ===
Prior to [[Brexit]] in 2020, Newport was part of the [[Wales (European Parliament constituency)|Wales European Parliament Constituency]]. The Wales constituency elected four [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEP) on a [[Proportional representation]] basis. In the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2019 European Parliament election]] the Wales constituency elected one MEP from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], one from [[Plaid Cymru]] and two from the [[Brexit Party]].

==Geography==
Newport is located {{cvt|138|mi|km|0}} west of [[London]] and {{cvt|12|mi|km|0}} east of [[Cardiff]]. It is the largest urban area within the [[Historic counties of Wales|historic county boundaries]] of [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]] and the [[preserved county]] of [[Gwent (county)|Gwent]]. The City of Newport, which includes rural areas as well as the built up area, is the sixth most populous [[List of Welsh principal areas by population|unitary authority]] in Wales.

The city is largely low-lying, but with a few hilly areas. [[Wentwood]] is {{cvt|1014|ft}} above sea level. Areas in the south and east of the city tend to be flat and fertile with some housing estates and industrial areas reclaimed from marshland. Areas near the banks of the River Usk, such as [[Caerleon]], are also low-lying. The eastern outskirts of the city are characterised by the gently rolling hills of the [[Vale of Usk]] and [[Christchurch, Newport|Christchurch]] has panoramic views of the Vale of Usk and the [[Bristol Channel]]. Ridgeway at [[Allt-yr-yn]] also has good views of the surrounding areas and Bristol Channel. [[Brynglas]] has views over the city centre and [[Twmbarlwm]] to the west. The [[suburb]]s of the city have grown outwards from the inner-city, mostly near the main roads, giving the suburban sprawl of the city an irregular shape. The urban area is continuing to expand rapidly with new housing estates continuing to be built.

The city boundaries include a number of villages in the [[Newport Built-up area]].

===Wards and districts===
:''See also [[:Category:Districts of Newport, Wales]]''
The city is divided into 21 wards. Most of these wards are coterminous with communities (parishes) of the same name. Each community can have an elected council. The following table lists city council wards, communities and associated geographical areas.

===Climate===

Newport has a moderate [[temperate]] [[climate]], with the weather rarely staying the same for more than a few days at a time. The city is one of the sunnier locations in Wales and its sheltered location tends to protect it from extreme weather. Like the whole of the British Isles, Newport benefits from the warming effect of the [[Gulf Stream]].

[[Thunderstorms]] may occur intermittently at any time of year, but are most common throughout late-spring and summer. Rain falls throughout the year, Atlantic storms give significant rainfall in the autumn, these gradually becoming rarer towards the end of winter. Autumn and summer have often been the wettest seasons in recent times. [[Snow]] falls in most winters and sometimes settles on the ground, usually melting within a few days. Newport records few days with [[gale]]s compared to most of Wales, again due to its sheltered location. [[Frost]]s are common from October to May.

On 20 March 1930, the overnight temperature fell to {{cvt|-16.1|°C|1}} the coldest temperature for the whole of the UK during that year, and the latest date in spring the UK's lowest temperature has been recorded.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=T.A.

[[File:Newport Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|[[Newport Cathedral]] – St Woolos]]
In 1929 St Woolos Church became the Pro-Cathedral of the [[Diocese of Monmouth]], becoming a full cathedral in 1949. When [[Rowan Williams]] was appointed [[Archbishop of Wales]] in 2000, the Cathedral became the Metropolitan Cathedral of Wales,<ref name="3 July 2010">{{cite web |title=Diocese of Monmouth – Newport Cathedral |url=http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/monmouth/people/cathedral/ |publisher=Church in Wales |access-date=3 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603015011/http://www.churchinwales.org.uk/monmouth/people/cathedral/ |archive-date=3 June 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> as it had when previous Bishops of Monmouth were elected Archbishop.

In 1850 Newport was recognised as a centre of [[Catholicism]] in Wales when the [[Diocese of Newport and Menevia]] was created. Between 21 October 1966 and 6 October 1969, having retired as Bishop of [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Fulton J. Sheen]], an American bishop who pioneered [[Televangelism|preaching on television and radio]], was appointed the titular archbishop of Newport by [[Pope Paul VI]]. The Catholic [[St Patrick's Church, Newport|St Patrick's Church]] was served by the [[Rosminians]] until the 2010s.

The foundation of the Charles Street Baptist Church was mainly the project of three women who had been members of Bethesda Baptist Chapel in [[Rogerstone]], which was first built in 1742. In 1807 a Mrs Samuel and her friends rented a room in John Rowe's house on Stow Hill and asked the preachers John Hier, and his subordinate James Edmunds, both from Bethesda, to preach to them there. They later moved to a larger room in Charles Street. In 1816 a meeting at the [[Castleton, Newport|Castleton]] Baptist Association agreed to build the first [[Baptist Union of Wales|Welsh Baptist Chapel]] in Newport. Land was acquired in Charles Street, with the help of a bequest from Newport tailor John Williams. In May 1817 the opening services of the new church were held. By July 1879 the decline in Welsh-speaking in the town led to a change in the services from Welsh to English. In September 1993, the Charles Street congregation joined with Ebbw Bridge Baptist Church, Newport, and the Charles Street Chapel closed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?inst_id=36&coll_id=77761&expand=|title=Charles Street Baptist Church, Newport, Records|date=23 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523045735/http://www.archiveswales.org.uk/anw/get_collection.php?inst_id=36&coll_id=77761&expand= |archive-date=23 May 2012 }}</ref>

==Regeneration==

The city has seen major regeneration projects being undertaken in recent years.

===Infrastructure===
The first stage of regeneration involved improving the city centre road network, turning Kingsway and Queensway into [[boulevard]]s. The [[Southern Distributor Road]] to the south of the city opened in 2004, including the new [[City Bridge]] over the River Usk, improving access and opening up new areas for development. The [[Newport City footbridge]] opened in 2006 linking the east and west banks of the river for pedestrians and cyclists.

[[Newport railway station]] was expanded in 2007<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/news/new-platform-for-newport-station |title=NEW PLATFORM FOR NEWPORT STATION |website=Network Rail Media Centre |language=en |access-date=2019-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219130328/https://www.networkrailmediacentre.co.uk/news/new-platform-for-newport-station |archive-date=19 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> to four full size platforms capable of receiving 10 car [[Intercity Express Programme]] services to and from [[London Paddington station|London Paddington]]. In 2010 a new station building was finished, carried out by engineering firm [[Atkins (company)|Atkins]]. During construction it was Wales' most environmentally friendly station work,<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.atkinsglobal.com/en-GB/media-centre/features/newport-station-gateway-to-wales |title=Newport Station: Gateway to Wales |website=atkinsglobal.com |language=en-GB |access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> using a hypermodern green [[ETFE]] structure similar to the materials used in [[Eden Project|the Eden Project]] and the Beijing Olympics' ‘[[Beijing National Aquatics Center|Water Cube]]’. In 2019 railway electrification and resigning work was completed, completing the [[21st-century modernisation of the Great Western main line]] and reducing journey times to London to 1 hour 30 minutes.

[[Newport bus station]] was redeveloped in 2013, expanded in 2015 with the Friars Walk development, and now offers 24 stands connecting to the rest of the city, as well as Cardiff and Bristol.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.pressrelease&contentid=CONT091177 |title=Start of works on Kingsway Centre |access-date=8 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608215621/http://www.newport.gov.uk/_dc/index.cfm?fuseaction=news.pressrelease&contentid=CONT091177 |archive-date=8 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref> Local railway stations are reopening, starting with [[Rogerstone railway station|Rogerstone station]] in 2008, [[Pye Corner railway station|Pye Corner station]] in 2014, and with three others planned in the city's [[Unitary Development Plan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newport.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/plans_and_strategies/cont063489.pdf |title=Newport Unitary Development Plan |publisher=Newport City Council |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723190027/http://www.newport.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/plans_and_strategies/cont063489.pdf |archive-date=23 July 2006 |url-status=dead |access-date=30 August 2006}}</ref> [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]] intend to restart services between Newport and [[Ebbw Vale Parkway railway station|Ebbw Vale Parkway]] by 2021.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/16266813.major-improvements-to-rail-promised-with-services-to-benefit-from-5bn-investment-including-one-train-per-hour-between-newport-and-ebbw-vale-by-2021/ |title=Major improvements to rail promised with services to benefit from £5bn investment – including Newport-Ebbw Vale link |website=South Wales Argus |date=4 June 2018 |language=en |access-date=2019-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190219183405/https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/16266813.major-improvements-to-rail-promised-with-services-to-benefit-from-5bn-investment-including-one-train-per-hour-between-newport-and-ebbw-vale-by-2021/ |archive-date=19 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Royal Gwent Hospital]] was downgraded to a minor injuries unit in 2020 when the new [[Grange University Hospital]] ([[Welsh language|Welsh]]: ''Ysbyty Athrofaol Y Faenor'') was opened at Llanfrechfa, near Cwmbrân.  There had been proposals to use the former [[Tata Steel Europe|Corus steel]] [[Level of Mendalgief|Whiteheads site]], close to the existing Royal Gwent site, for a replacement hospital but this was considered to have the same access and space restrictions as the current hospital.  It was decided to redevelop the [[Llanfrechfa Grange Hospital]] site, a former mental health and disabilities residential centre near [[Cwmbran]], as a specialist and critical care unit.

The [[M4 relief road]] skirting the southern edge of the urban area of Newport was proposed as a means of reducing the congestion on the existing M4 motorway (presently squeezed through the [[Brynglas Tunnels]]) and making Newport and the surrounding areas more accessible for motorised vehicles. The relief road scheme was cancelled in July 2009 but relaunched in 2014.{{citation needed|date=September 2024}} A final decision not to proceed with the scheme was announced by the then [[First Minister of Wales|First Minister]] of Wales, [[Mark Drakeford|Mark Drakeford AM]], on 4 June 2019.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Morris |first=Steven |date=4 June 2019 |title=Wales scraps £1.4bn Gwent Levels relief road |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2019/jun/04/wales-scraps-gwent-levels-m4-relief-road-scheme |access-date=11 July 2024 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

===Leisure===
[[File:Riverfront.JPG|thumb|[[Riverfront Arts Centre]] next to the River Usk]]
The [[Riverfront Arts Centre]] was the first structure to be built as part of Newport's regeneration by [[Newport City Council]] in 2004. It stands on Kingsway on the west bank of the River Usk. On the east bank, [[Rodney Parade]] is home to the regional [[Pro14|United Rugby Championship (rugby union)]] team [[Dragons (rugby union)|Dragons]] and the [[English Football League|football]] team [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County AFC.]] Club rugby union side [[Newport RFC]] play some home games at the ground (it was their home fro  1877 to 2016) but reotherwise based at [[Newport Stadium]] in [[Spytty Park|Spytty]].

For those travelling west from England into Wales, Newport is the first major urban area one passes through. As a result, it is a convergence point for national road, bus, and rail routes.

===Aviation===

The nearest airport with scheduled domestic and international flights is [[Cardiff Airport]], {{cvt|30|mi|km|-1|abbr=off}} south-west of Newport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newport.gov.uk/rydercup/index.cfm?event=visitorHome |title=Newport – host city to the 2010 Ryder Cup |publisher=Newport.gov.uk |access-date=22 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531124406/http://www.newport.gov.uk/rydercup/index.cfm?event=visitorHome |archive-date=31 May 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The airport is a 35-minute drive away from the city or a 55-minute train journey which involves changing at Cardiff Central for [[Vale of Glamorgan Line]] services to the nearby [[Rhoose Cardiff International Airport railway station]]. The airport is also accessible by transferring to 24-hour [[TrawsCymru]] T9 buses, which begin at Cardiff Central station.

In 2003, a proposal for a new ''Severnside'' airport near Newport was rejected by the [[Department for Transport]]. The airport would have featured runways on a man-made island in the [[Severn Estuary]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3325353.stm |title=Wales &#124; New £2bn airport plan dropped |date=16 December 2003 |access-date=22 January 2013 |publisher=BBC News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305133605/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/3325353.stm |archive-date=5 March 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Newport is the easternmost Welsh city on the United Kingdom rail network and has close proximity to major economic centres in Cardiff and Bristol. [[Newport railway station]] is the third-busiest station in Wales and, due to its interchange options, it serves as a major transfer station.

The [[Great Western Main Line]] connects the city with termini at [[Bristol Temple Meads railway station|Bristol Temple Meads]], [[Paddington railway station|London Paddington]] and [[Pembroke Dock railway station|Pembroke Dock]]; the [[Welsh Marches line]] connects with [[Holyhead railway station|Holyhead]], [[Manchester Piccadilly railway station|Manchester Piccadilly]] and [[Llanelli railway station|Llanelli]]; and the [[Gloucester–Newport line|Gloucester line]] connects the borders region including [[Cheltenham Spa railway station|Cheltenham]]. The [[Wessex Main Line]] also provides an hourly service from the city to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station|Portsmouth]]. The station has four platforms and is a mandatory stop on all [[Intercity Express Programme|express]] services to and from London Paddington.

The city is well linked with the nearby Welsh capital [[Cardiff]], with approximately six rail and five bus services between the cities every hour.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ptsllibrary.co.uk/newport/website/pdf/TIMETABLES%204%20JAN%2009_lowres.pdf |title=Train Info – Plusbus |publisher=Ptsllibrary.co.uk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120223013522/http://www.ptsllibrary.co.uk/newport/website/pdf/TIMETABLES%204%20JAN%2009_lowres.pdf |archive-date=23 February 2012 |access-date=22 January 2013}}</ref> Services to/from Bristol stop at Newport on average 2–3 times per hour, while there are nearly 4 services to/from London each hour.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thetrainline.com/train-times/newport-gwent-to-bristol-temple-meads |title=Trains Newport (South Wales) to Bristol Temple Meads {{!}} Cheap Tickets & Times |website=Trainline |language=en |access-date=2019-10-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191028201428/https://www.thetrainline.com/train-times/newport-gwent-to-bristol-temple-meads |archive-date=28 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Modernisation ====
The current [[Newport railway station|Newport station]] was built in 2010, in a hypermodern green [[ETFE]] structure, after a £22 million refurbishment programme; it introduced the futuristic new passenger terminal and bridge, whilst restoring the 19th-century features of the site. The new complex, west of the old station entrance, includes two terminals, four full-size platforms, new terminal buildings and a public footbridge, a new passenger footbridge, a new taxi area, short-stay car park and a 250-space passenger car park.

The [[21st-century modernisation of the Great Western main line]] programme has seen the installation of new facilities on platforms 2 and 3, including redesigned toilets, waiting rooms and covered areas.

Overhead line equipment has been installed through the city, as part of electrification of the London to Cardiff line, which allows the operation of Japanese-built [[Intercity Express Programme]] 10-car trains. The new services are all-electric, with more seats and improvements to journey times between Newport and London of around 1 hour 30 minutes, including non-stop services after Wales between [[Bristol Parkway]] and London Paddington.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/how-electrification-reduce-journey-times-12850677 |title=How electrification will reduce journey times between South Wales and London |last=Barry |first=Sion |date=2017-04-05 |website=walesonline |access-date=2019-02-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220003106/https://www.walesonline.co.uk/business/how-electrification-reduce-journey-times-12850677 |archive-date=20 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Rogerstone railway station]], on the [[Ebbw Valley Railway|Ebbw Valley (Western Valleys) line]], reopened in 2008 and [[Pye Corner railway station|Pye Corner]], close to the site of the former Bassaleg railway station, opened around 2015.  [[Transport for Wales Rail|Transport for Wales]] services run between [[Ebbw Vale Town railway station|Ebbw Vale]] and [[Cardiff Central railway station|Cardiff Central]], and between [[Ebbw Vale Town railway station|Ebbw Vale]] and [[Newport railway station|Newport]], via Rogerstone and Pye Corner.  Direct services between Ebbw Vale and Newport were reintroduced in early 2024 following work on local signalling.

There are active proposals from [[Grand Central (train operating company)|Grand Central]] to operate services from Llanelli, via Cardiff and Newport, to London Paddington, only stopping at Severn Tunnel Junction and Bristol Parkway instead of the current service which also calls at Didcot Parkway, Swindon and Reading.<ref>{{Cite book |title=& C |last=Stuart-Wortley, Emmeline, Lady, 1806–1855. |date=1853 |publisher=Thomas Bosworth |oclc=780195740}}</ref>

Newport has three major museums: [[Newport Museum]] in the city centre and at [[Caerleon]] the [[National Roman Legion Museum]] and [[Roman Baths Museum]]. [[Newport Central Library]] is located within Newport Museum. In July each year an Arts festival is held in Caerleon and Roman Military re-enactment in the amphitheatre, the largest restored amphitheatre in Britain. The remains of the Roman baths, barracks and fortress walls of [[Isca Augusta]] can be seen at Caerleon. Caerleon also has literary associations to the legend of [[King Arthur]] through [[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] and later [[Arthur Machen]] (who was born in Caerleon) and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]] wrote his [[Idylls of the King]] in Caerleon.

The Newport Festival runs throughout the summer months with a large number of events being staged in the city centre and elsewhere in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newport.gov.uk/newportfestival/ |title=Newport Festival website |publisher=Newport.gov.uk |access-date=22 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120516015908/http://www.newport.gov.uk/newportFestival/ |archive-date=16 May 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Set in a park of {{cvt|90|acre|ha|abbr=off|0}}, [[Tredegar House]] is an example of a 17th-century [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] mansion. The earliest surviving part of the building dates back to the late 15th century. For over five hundred years, it was home to the Morgans – later [[Baron Tredegar|Lords Tredegar]] – until they left in 1951. The house was then bought by the Catholic Church and used as a girls' school until it was bought by the council in 1974, which led to it being described as the "grandest council house in Britain".<ref name=Tredegar-House-Brief-History>{{cite web |url=http://www.newport.gov.uk/rydercup/index.cfm?event=thingsToSeeTredegarHouse&contentID=CONT217318 |title=Tredegar House: A brief history of the building |publisher=Newport City Council |access-date=24 February 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609003607/http://www.newport.gov.uk/rydercup/index.cfm?event=thingsToSeeTredegarHouse&contentID=CONT217318 |archive-date=9 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The boxer [[David Pearce (boxer)|David Pearce]] was born in Newport.

===Rugby===
[[Newport RFC]] was established in 1874 and was one of the founder members of the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] in 1881.  Newport was the only side to beat the (otherwise) Invincible [[All Blacks]] of [[1963–64 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain, Ireland, France and North America|1963–64]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/24743759|title= Reliving the day Newport RFC beat the 1963 All Blacks|date=30 October 2013|newspaper=BBC|access-date=28 November 2022}}</ref> and has also beaten the other two major Southern Hemisphere sides, [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] and [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]], in its history.

Since the introduction of regional rugby franchises in Wales in 2003, Newport RFC now play in the [[Welsh Premier Division]] and operate as a [[feeder club]] to the [[Dragons (rugby union)|Dragons]] regional team, who play in the [[United Rugby Championship]].

Newport's best known [[association football]] club is [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]], who were formed in 1912 and joined the [[English Football League]] in 1920. Newport County have played in the second tier of English football and spent over 60 seasons in the Football League, reached the last 16 of the [[FA Cup]], won the [[Welsh Cup]] in 1980 and subsequently reached the quarter-finals of the [[UEFA Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup Winners' Cup]] in 1981. They were relegated from the Football League in 1988 and went [[bankrupt]] the following year. The club re-formed in 1989.

[[Lovells Athletic F.C.|Lovell's Athletic]] were a fairly well known team in the mid-20th century – due to the suspension of League football during the Second World War they were the premier team in the city, as Newport County did not field a side. During this period they managed to reach the 3rd round of the FA Cup in the [[FA Cup 1945–46|1945–46 season]].

[[Dragon Park]] (Welsh: ''Parc y Ddraig''), the [[Football Association of Wales]]' National Football Centre, is located at the [[Newport International Sports Village]]. The centre also provides the headquarters for the [[Welsh Football Trust]].
