'''Muttrah''', ({{langx|ar|مطرح}}) administratively a [[wilayah]] ([[province]]), is located in the [[Muscat Governorate|Muscat]] Governorate of [[Oman]]. Before the discovery of oil in Oman, Muttrah was the center of commerce in Oman (Muscat). It is still a center of commerce as one of the largest seaports of the region is located there. Other landmarks include [[Souq Muttrah]], a traditional [[bazaar]] and [[Sour Al-Lawatiah]], a small community of houses surrounded by an old wall. To the south lies [[Muscat District]].

==Demographics==
Muttrah had an estimated population of about 8,000 people when diplomat [[Edmund Roberts (diplomat)|Edmund Roberts]] visited in the early 1830s.<ref name=Roberts1>{{cite book|last=Roberts|first=Edmund|title=Embassy to the Eastern Courts of Cochin-China, Siam, and Muscat|year=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|location=New York|page=361|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7317/view/1/361/}}</ref> The district population was 234,225 as of the 2016 Census, up from 200,578 in 2014, making it the most densely populated district in the nation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.citypopulation.de/php/oman-admin.php |title=Oman: Administrative Division (Governorates & Districts) - population statistics and maps |access-date=2014-08-19 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821012807/http://www.citypopulation.de/php/oman-admin.php |archive-date=2014-08-21 }}</ref>

The Sūr al-Luwātiyah neighborhood is home to the [[Al-Lawatia|al-Luwātiyah]] tribe, which speaks the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] [[Luwati language]].<ref name="Luwati">{{Cite journal|last=Ahmed|first=Al-Ismaili|date=2018|title=Ethnic, Linguistic, and Religious Pluralism in Oman: The Link with Political Stability|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.31430/almuntaqa.1.3.0058|journal=Al Muntaqa|volume=1|issue=3 |pages=58–73|doi=10.31430/almuntaqa.1.3.0058 |jstor=10.31430/almuntaqa.1.3.0058 |via=JSTOR}}</ref> The language and people were first mentioned historically by the Omani historian Ibn Ruzayq.

==Economy==
In the mid 19th century, Muttrah had a vessel repair industry.<ref name=Roberts1/>

=== Souq Muttrah ===
[[File:Muttrah Souq.jpg|thumb|right|The Muttrah Souq]]
[[File:Mutrah (2).jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Muttrah Souq]]
Al Dhalam ("Darkness" in English) [[bazaar|Souq]] is the local name for the Muttrah Souq. The Muttrah Souq is one of the oldest marketplaces in Oman dating back two hundred years.<ref name="omantourism">{{Cite web|url=https://omantourism.gov.om/wps/portal/mot/tourism/oman/details|title=Travel to Oman|website=Ministry of Tourism, Sultanate of Oman|access-date=2020-10-15}}</ref> It is located adjacent to the harbor of Muscat and has seen immense trade in the age of sail, being strategically located on the way to [[India]] and [[China]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sgclub.com/whats-going-on/ancient-treasure-ship-the-great-oman-voyage-exhibition/ |title=Ancient Treasure Ship & the Great Oman Voyage Exhibition &#124; SGClub Portal |website=Sgclub.com |access-date=2017-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094320/http://www.sgclub.com/whats-going-on/ancient-treasure-ship-the-great-oman-voyage-exhibition/ |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was named after darkness because of the crowded stalls and lanes where the sunrays do not infiltrate during the day and the shoppers need lamps to know their destinations. The name of the market has been drawn specifically from the part that extends from Al Lawatiya Mosque to Khour Bimba where the place is really full of stores and stalls and the narrow area of lanes does not allow the sunlight to enter. The market was a source of supply for Omanis where they could buy their needs in the 1960s when life requirements were simpler than today. Most of the goods were imported, in addition to local products like textiles, fruit, vegetables and dates.

In the past, the market was built from mud and palm leaves, which suit the high temperatures and the hard climate conditions and hence were the best available materials to build the market at that time. Today, the [[Muscat Municipality]] has renovated and decorated the market to maintain the popular style but has also introduced modern amenities and redecorated the market heavily to attract tourists and make the shopping experience comfortable for tourists as well as other ordinary shoppers.

The market becomes more crowded and active during Eid seasons when Omanis come from all over the country to buy garments and jewelry.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.omanet.om/english/tourism/herit/souqs.asp?cat=tour&subcat=herit1 |title=Souqs in Oman |access-date=2011-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110926212144/http://www.omanet.om/english/tourism/herit/souqs.asp?cat=tour&subcat=herit1 |archive-date=2011-09-26 }}</ref>

The main thoroughfare of the souq carries mainly household goods, shoes and ready-made garments. Further inside, there are mixed smells of [[frankincense]], perfume oils, fresh [[jasmine]], and spices. There are also tiny shops (on the side streets and alleyways leading up to the souq) with Omani silver, stalls of white [[dishdasha]]s and embroidered [[Kumah (cloth)|kumah]]s,{{what|date=May 2017}} brightly colored cloth, and multicolored [[Head scarf|head scarves]]. Shoppers can even obtain old Arabian muskets at these souqs.{{fact|date=May 2017}}

Other items sold at the souq include Omani pots, paintings, [[hookah]] pipes, framed ''[[khanjar]]''s (daggers), leatherwork, and [[incense]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shangri-la.com/en/property/muscat/barraljissahresort/explore/muttrahsouk |title=Muscat Shopping &#124; Muttrah Souq Muscat |access-date=2011-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303005835/http://www.shangri-la.com/en/property/muscat/barraljissahresort/explore/muttrahsouk |archive-date=2011-03-03 }}</ref>

The souq goes by various names: Market of Darkness, due to its myriad of alleys and roads lined by shops that block the sun during the day. The east and west parts are also known as "the small market" and "the large market".<ref name="omantourism"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.expatwoman.com/oman/guide/muttrah-souq-in-oman|title=Muttrah Souq in Oman|date=2013-07-18|website=ExpatWoman.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Port Sultan Qaboos===
{{main|Port Sultan Qaboos}}

Commonly called the Muscat Port, Port Sultan Qaboos is one of the main commercial ports in [[Oman]]. It is Oman's premier maritime gateway, enjoying a prime location in the politically stable sultanate. Situated in a natural harbour 250 km south of the Strait of Hormuz on the Indian Ocean coast of the Arabian Peninsula. Port Sultan Qaboos' location makes it an ideal hub, not only for the [[Persian Gulf]] but also the Indian sub-continent and markets in East and South Africa.

The location of Port Sultan Qaboos offers considerable savings in steaming time when compared to other ports. The port's tariff compares very favorably with others across the region. The already impressive infrastructure, skilled manpower, fast and efficient handling operations and documentation clearance system in PSC will be further enhanced this year.

During the reign of Sayyid Sultan bin Ahmed in the 18th century, Oman's trading activity again increased and the capital area's two harbours &mdash; Muscat and Mutrah &mdash; diversified, Mutrah was quickly established as a commercial port while Muscat was used for naval operations. The ruler's son Sayyid Said continued to expand maritime commerce although it again went into decline after his death in 1856. Maritime activity was limited to the import of essential items, mainly from India by old-style wooden dhows. Ships had to anchor offshore and sometimes wait for days before cargo could be unloaded manually into small boats. 
[[File:Puerto de Mutrah, Omán, 2024-08-14, DD 04.jpg|Muscat Port|thumb|left]]
This was all to change with the accession of HM Sultan [[Qaboos bin Said]] who inaugurated a new era of maritime commerce and prosperity in Oman when he established Mina Qaboos (now Port Sultan Qaboos) in 1974.

Port Sultan Qaboos has been operated and managed by Port Services Corporation S.A.O.G. since November 1976. Until 1981, the traffic was essentially conventional cargo. With the advent of containerisation, PSQ developed two of its berths to handle container vessels and these facilities were fully operational by 1983&ndash;1984. 

PSC embarked on computerization of its operations and back office in 1984. The first system to handle container movements became operational from 1985 to 1999. Thereafter the computer applications were enhanced to cover all back office operations including invoicing and accounts.

In the early 1990s, the port infrastructure was further enhanced. Two more berths were converted to handle multipurpose vessels including container vessels and were equipped with additional three quay-side gantry cranes. The marshaling yard and empty yard was provided with rubber tyred gantries. On date, the port is an ideal transshipment hub for the upper Persian Gulf and Red Sea ports trade flows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pscoman.com/marketing/about1.htm |title=Welcome to Port Services Corporation Web Site |access-date=2011-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715125259/http://www.pscoman.com/marketing/about1.htm |archive-date=2011-07-15 }}</ref>

== History ==
In early 1971, Muttrah witnessed the end of [[Imam]] [[Azzan bin Qais]], who had been the [[Imam]] of [[Oman]] between 1868 and 1871. Bin Qaid had deposed his cousin, [[Sayyid Salim bin Thuwaini|Salim bin Thuwaini]], and declared a short-lived Ibadi [[imamate]] in Oman.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hopper |first=Matthew S. |date=2019 |title=Review of A SEA OF DEBT: LAW AND ECONOMIC LIFE IN THE WESTERN INDIAN OCEAN, 1780-1950 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/26732407 |journal=The Arab Studies Journal |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=171–175 |issn=1083-4753}}</ref> He fought and lost against Salim's uncle, [[Sayyid Turki bin Said]], at the [[Battle of Dhank]] in October 1879, before being killed in battle at [[Muttrah]] in January 1871.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lorimer |first=John |title=Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf |publisher=British Government, Bombay |year=1915 |pages=729}}</ref>

==In popular culture==
Muttrah is also a map in a popular ''[[Battlefield 2]]'' mod, ''[[Project Reality]]''. It was also featured on ''[[The Amazing Race (American TV series)|The Amazing Race]]'' in the eighth episode of its [[The Amazing Race 17|17th season]].
