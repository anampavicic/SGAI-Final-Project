'''Fremont''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|iː|m|ɒ|n|t}}) is a city in [[Alameda County, California]], United States. Located in the [[East Bay]] region of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]], Fremont has a population of 230,504 as of 2020,<ref name="CensusQuickFacts" /> making it the fourth [[List of cities and towns in the San Francisco Bay Area|most populous city in the Bay Area]], behind [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]. It is the closest East Bay city to the high-tech [[Silicon Valley]] network of businesses, and has a strong tech industry presence.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abc7news.com/fremont-california-abc7-news-building-a-better-bay-area-mayor-lily-mei/5709944/|title=Fremont's tech community flourishes as city leaders look for more ways to be efficient|date=November 19, 2020|publisher=[[KGO-TV]]|access-date=August 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2016/04/29/quinn-the-next-silicon-valley-fremont-and-berkeley-drive-tech-scene-growth/|publisher=[[Mercury News]]|title=Quinn: The next Silicon Valley?

The city's origins lie in the community that arose around [[Mission San José (California)|Mission San José]], founded in 1797 by the Spanish under Padre [[Fermín Lasuén]]. Fremont was incorporated on January 23, 1956, when the former towns of Mission San José, Centerville, Niles, Irvington, and Warm Springs unified into one city.<ref name="Fremont 1989">{{cite book |last1=Oral History Associates, Sausalito, California |title=City of Fremont: The first thirty years, history of growth |date=1989 |publisher=The Mission Peak Heritage Foundation |edition=LC 89-60547}}</ref> Fremont is named after [[John C.

==History==
[[File:MissionSanJoseCA.LYH.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Fremont's origins lie in the community that arose around [[Mission San José (California)|Mission San José]], founded in 1795 by the Spanish under Padre [[Fermín de Lasuén]].]]

===Early history===
[[File:Vallejo flour mill 2008.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Vallejo Flour Mill|Vallejo Mill]], built in 1853 by [[José de Jesús Vallejo]]]]
The recorded history of the Fremont area began on June 6, 1797, when [[Mission San José (California)|Mission San José]] was founded by the Spaniard Father [[Fermín de Lasuén]]. The Mission was established at the site of the [[Ohlone]] village of Oroysom. The tribe lived between present-day San Francisco and Monterey and more lands eastward. They lived in dome-shaped shelters made out of redwood bark or woven tule. They were primarily hunter-gatherers; men hunted and trapped waterfowl, rabbits, deer, elk, and bears, whilst women gathered nuts, berries, and root vegetables.<ref name=":02">{{Cite journal |last=Lopez |first=Grecel |date=April 2019 |title=California's Lost Tribe |url= |journal=Wild West |volume=31 |pages=28–29 |via=MasterFILE Complete}}</ref> The Ohlone tribe lived beside rivers and estuaries because of the natural resources like fish and shellfish. In warm weather, men wore mostly nothing; in the winter, they wore animal hide or feather capes. Other than the weather, ceremonies also decided what the Ohlone men wore. The women wore deerskin aprons over skirts made of tule or shredded bark.<ref name=":02"/>

Until 1769, the tribe lived peacefully but Spanish soldiers and missionaries arrived in California to expand Spanish dominion in the Americas and convert the Native Americans to Catholicism.<ref name=":02"/> The Ohlone people weren't intimidated by the Franciscan priests, who welcomed them into their missions to live and work. Before missions, the Natives used tools made of stone, animal bones, and wood.<ref name=":02" /> The missionaries taught them how to make metal tools and weapons and priests also showed them how to make adobe bricks. The bricks were then used to build missions rather than for the tribe to utilize. The Spaniards brought cattle, pigs and sheep and encouraged the Ohlone to give up hunting and gathering to try farming and ranching instead.<ref name=":02" /> Living in the missions meant Ohlone people were forced into converting to Christianity and told to forget the superstitious beliefs that connected them to nature. Along with that, overpopulation caused food shortages and the Spanish brought diseases to the tribe, causing a lot of deaths and trouble that made an impact on a lot of lives.<ref name=":02" />

On their second day in the area, the Mission party killed a [[grizzly bear]] in [[Niles Canyon]]. The first English-speaking visitor to Fremont was the renowned trapper and explorer [[Jedediah Smith]] in 1827. The Mission prospered, eventually reaching a population of 1,887 inhabitants in 1831. The influence of the missionaries declined after 1834 when the Mexican government enacted [[secularization]].

[[Mariano Vallejo#Family life|José de Jesus Vallejo]], brother of [[Mariano Vallejo]], was the grantee of the [[Rancho Arroyo de la Alameda]] [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]]. His family was influential in the Fremont area in the late colonial era and owned and built a [[Vallejo Flour Mill|flour mill]] at the mouth of [[Niles Canyon]].<ref name=chl>{{cite web|title=Alameda County|url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=21388|work=California Historical Landmarks|publisher=State of California Office of Historic Preservation|access-date= May 6, 2011}}</ref> In 1846 the town's namesake [[John C. Frémont]] led a military expedition to map a trail through [[Mission Pass (Alameda County)|Mission Pass]] for reaching the Pacific coast and to take possession of California from Mexico for the United States.
[[File:Dominican Convent of Mission San José 1310.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Convent of the Holy Rosary, founded in 1906]]
The Fremont area grew rapidly at the time of the [[California Gold Rush]]. A town called Mission San José grew up around the old mission, with its own post office from 1850. Agriculture dominated the economy with grapes, nursery plants and olives as leading crops. In 1868 the 6.8-magnitude [[1868 Hayward earthquake|Hayward earthquake]] on the [[Hayward Fault]] collapsed buildings throughout the Fremont area, ruining Mission San José and its outbuildings. Until the [[1906 San Francisco earthquake]] caused its destruction, the Fremont area's Palmdale Winery was the largest in California. The ruins of the Palmdale Winery are still visible near the Five Corners in Irvington at the intersection of Washington Boulevard and Osgood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/pages/wineries.htm |title=Jill M.

From 1912 to 1915, the Niles section of the Fremont area was the earliest home of California's motion picture industry<ref>[http://www.nilesfilmmuseum.org/story.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060224221157/http://www.nilesfilmmuseum.org/story.html|date=February 24, 2006}}</ref> (see [[Essanay Studios]]). [[Charlie Chaplin]] filmed several movies in the Fremont area, most notably ''[[The Tramp (film)|The Tramp]]''.

===Incorporation===
Fremont was incorporated in 1956 under the leadership of Wally Pond, chair of the incorporation committee, when five towns in the area, Irvington, Centerville, Mission San José, Niles, and Warm Springs, came together to form a city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.fremont.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=837 |title=Archived copy |access-date=May 5, 2011 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929003753/http://www.fremont.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=837 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Glenmoor Gardens, the largest subdivision in Fremont, was under construction in the area, by developers Ralph E. Cotter Jr., James R. Meyer, civil engineer Fred T. Duvall, and contractors James L. Reeder, and Robert H. Reeder. When the Glenmoor Gardens Homeowners Association (GGHA) was incorporated, in March 1953, there were no more than 75 houses in the subdivision. It was probably the first such organization in the Fremont area; in its scope and structure. The five-member board of directors (which included James Meyer and James Reeder) was set up to oversee a full range of services, from police and fire protection to street maintenance (which later became the purview of the city government).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://fremont.gov/documentcenter/view/25617 |title=Archived copy |access-date=July 17, 2016 |archive-date=June 24, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624094320/https://fremont.gov/DocumentCenter/View/25617 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] automotive assembly plant in South Fremont was the town's largest employer, and Fremont was known for its drag strip. In the 1980s, the plant became a joint venture automotive assembly plant of [[Toyota]] and [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]], and was renamed [[NUMMI]]. [[Toyota]] and [[NUMMI]] shut down its operations in early 2010. Part of the plant was acquired in June 2010 by [[Tesla Motors]] as its primary production plant, known as the [[Tesla Factory]].

==Geography==
{{overly detailed|section|date=June 2022}}

In 1956, five small, independent towns (Centerville, Niles, Irvington, Mission San José, and Warm Springs) located between the East Bay rolling hills and the San Francisco Bay were annexed into a single new, incorporated city called Fremont. Six decades later, these places have greatly expanded, are no longer separate communities, and are considered districts or community plan areas of the City of Fremont. The town of [[Newark, California|Newark]] was originally slated to join the annex, but ultimately its voters declined since Newark representatives suspected that they would become an industrial district; Newark became its own incorporated city in 1955. Later, Newark annexed a patch of unincorporated land between Mowry Avenue and Stevenson Blvd; Land which is now occupied by [[NewPark Mall|Newpark Mall]] and the surrounding plazas. Since incorporation, Fremont has created six more districts, which it calls "community plan areas" for planning purposes. These include Central, North Fremont, South Fremont, and Bayside. The two other districts, Baylands and the Hill Areas, are primarily open space.<ref name="general_plan_2030_ch4">{{cite book | chapter-url=http://www.fremont.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=4667 | chapter-format=PDF | chapter=Chapter 4: Community Character | title=General Plan 2030 Working Draft | publisher=City of Fremont, California | date=November 2010 | access-date=November 24, 2010 | archive-date=December 29, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229084943/http://www.fremont.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=4667 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Group|first=Linh Tat {{!}} Southern California News|date=September 19, 2005|title=Newark, Fremont have love -hate bond|url=https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2005/09/19/newark-fremont-have-love-hate-bond/|access-date=September 23, 2021|website=East Bay Times|language=en-US}}</ref>

The area consisting of Fremont and the cities of [[Newark, California|Newark]] and [[Union City, California|Union City]] is known collectively as the Tri-City Area (different from the adjacent [[Tri-Valley]] area encompassing [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], [[Dublin, California|Dublin]], and [[Livermore, California|Livermore]]).

===Centerville District===<!-- This section is linked from Centerville -->
Centerville was formerly the main town in [[Washington Township, Alameda County, California|Washington Township]]. Centerville is located at {{Coord|37|33|15|N|121|59|57|W|name=Centerville}}. It lies at an elevation of {{convert|52|ft|m}}. Centerville was started by George Lloyd who started selling cold beer to stage passengers from a tent in 1850.<ref name=CGN615>{{California's Geographic Names|615}}</ref> Capt. George Bond set up a general store and the name Centerville was chosen.<ref name=CGN615 /> The post office opened Centreville post office in 1855 and changed the spelling to Centerville in 1893.<ref name=CGN615 /> The [[Centerville Pioneer Cemetery]] contains the burial places of many of the city's founding pioneers.

Centerville can be traced back to its native American roots. Spanish, Mexican, Italian, Portuguese and Swiss (Swiss Park), peoples were among the early settlers that contributed greatly to the growth of Centerville.

Early Centerville was a quiet farming community, which consisted of large Spanish land grants divided into smaller farms. The Freitas Ranch on Thornton Ave was probably the largest of the working farms. There were acres of apricot along with other fruit and nut orchards and large fields of various types of fresh produce.<ref>{{cite book | last =Holmes | first =Philip | title = Centerville, Fremont | series = Images of America| publisher = Arcadia Publishing| isbn= 978-0738581774  | year =2011 }}</ref>

After President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]], which authorized military commanders to exclude "any or all persons" from certain areas in the name of national defense, the [[Western Defense Command]] began ordering Japanese Americans living on the West Coast to present themselves for "evacuation" from the newly created military zones. This included many Centerville farming families.

Centerville was also a main stop for the early railways. This gave the local farmers a way to quickly get their produce to market. With the access to railway service there was once a large cannery on Baine Ave. west of Fremont Ave. (now Peralta) next to the tracks. In 1959, the cannery was destroyed in the largest fire in Fremont's history.<ref>{{cite web| title =History of the Fremont Fire Department| url =https://www.fremont.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/733| website =fremont.gov| access-date =September 23, 2015| archive-date =June 29, 2016| archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160629133108/https://fremont.gov/DocumentCenter/Home/View/733| url-status =dead}}</ref> The fire lasted for two days, and effectively put an end to what had been the largest employer in Centerville at the time.

[[Housing development]]s began to appear in the area after WWII. Most of the early housing stood along Fremont Blvd from Decoto Road south to Washington High school, along Thornton Ave from Fremont Blvd west to the Newark city border, and along Peralta Blvd from Fremont Blvd to Niles.

For city planning purposes, Centerville was enlarged to encompass most of the north central residential section of Fremont, from Mowry Ave to Decoto Rd, from [[Interstate 880 (California)|I-880]] to the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] line. This Centerville community plan area includes the sprawling subdivisions, developed in the 1950s and 1960s, of [[Glenmoor Gardens]], bounded by Central Avenue, Fremont Boulevard, Mowry Avenue, and the I-880 freeway. and the Cabrillo Park subdivision bound by Thornton Ave, Fremont Blvd, Decoto Road and the I-880 freeway.

===Niles District===
[[File:Niles-Artwalk-2005.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Niles Art Walk 2005]]
The former town of Niles is physically divided from other parts of Fremont and neighboring Union City by [[Mission Boulevard (East Bay, California)|Mission Boulevard]] ([[California State Route 238|State Route 238]]) to the east and north, Alameda Creek to the south, [[Union Pacific Railroad]] to the west and southeast, and the Quarry Lakes to the southwest. The hills of Niles are lower than those of the area south of the Alameda Creek in Mission San Jose. Old Town Niles features its own library, post office, and silent movie theater as well as a large number of antique and craft stores. Niles is located at {{Coord|37|34|44|N|121|58|40|W|name=Niles District}}. It lies at an elevation of {{convert|112|ft|m}}.

Niles was the West Coast home (1912–1916) of one of the first motion picture companies, [[Essanay Studios]]. [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Broncho Billy Anderson]] filmed some of their most famous silent movies in Niles and the scenic [[Niles Canyon]] that stretches between Niles and [[Sunol, California|Sunol]]. The nonprofit [[Niles Essanay Silent Film Museum]] offers both artifacts of Niles' early years and, each Saturday evening, screenings of early-twentieth-century silent films, many of which were filmed locally.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Newhouse |first=Dave |date=March 7, 2011 |title=Niles was the first Hollywood |url=https://www.mercurynews.com/2011/03/07/dave-newhouse-niles-was-the-first-hollywood/ |access-date=January 31, 2024 |website=The Mercury News |language=en-US}}</ref>

The [[Niles Canyon Railway]] runs along [[Alameda Creek]] in [[Niles Canyon]] and carries passengers on weekend excursions, including a holiday "train of lights", which is extremely popular&nbsp;– tickets for these trains typically sell out by early October.

===Irvington District===
{{redirect-distinguish|Irving, California|Irvine, California}}
The Irvington District area, once the town of Irving, has cycled through many name changes over time. In the early 1850s two emancipated black men were traveling with E.L. Beard through California, reputedly in search of a fortune. The former slaves noticed the busy traffic at the crossroads of what is today the "Five Corners" intersection. Although now gone, there were two embarcaderos (water crossings) at this area. One of these crossings had a ferry. Realizing the financial opportunity of the area, the former slaves constructed the first building at the cross roads, a tavern with an inn. This tavern was later known as Dave's Saloon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/documents/African-Amer-UnionCity.pdf |title=African-Americans in the Union City Area |access-date=September 16, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627032718/http://www.museumoflocalhistory.org/documents/African-Amer-UnionCity.pdf |archive-date=June 27, 2014 }}</ref> This corner, today the intersection of Fremont and Washington Boulevards, Union and Bay Streets, is now commonly known as "Five Corners" or Irvington Square. Irvington Square's marker, Irvington Plaza park, is located at {{Coord|37|31|22|N|121|58|18|W|name=Irvington Square}}. The inn and several of the other original buildings were demolished by the city of Fremont in the early 1980s.
In 1871 [[Washington College (California)|Washington College]], the first industrial educational institution in California was established in Washington township near the crossroads. As a result, the US Postal Service established a post office called Washington Corners at the college in 1870, which became the name of the settlement on the 1878 [[Alameda County]] map of Washington Township.

In 1884, realizing the need for a proper town name, local inhabitants selected the name of Irving. The name was chosen in honor of Judge Irving, the local traveling circuit judge of the time. Later, when the railroad came through the area, the published train schedule pamphlets erroneously listed the Irving train depot as "Irvington." The town petitioned the railroad about the error. The railroad company notified the town that it was too costly for them to replace the train schedule pamphlets (over $100,000); and in 1887 following the recommendation, the people of Irving changed the town name to Irvington.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The Irvington district has two main neighborhoods: Irvington Woods and the Irvington Square. The neighborhood is ethnically mixed and is primarily working class.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govwarrantsearch.org/california-ca/fremont|title=Fremont {{!}} Warrant Search|website=www.govwarrantsearch.org|language=en|access-date=June 7, 2018}}</ref> For city planning purposes, the Irvington area was enlarged to encompass most of the south central residential section of Fremont, from [[Auto Mall]] Parkway to Mowry Avenue, from I-880 to roughly the BART line (excluding the Central District described below). This Irvington community plan area includes the Sundale neighborhood, the South Sundale neighborhood, 28 Palms, Blacow, and Grimmer subdivisions. The area is served by three high schools: [[Irvington High School (Fremont, California)|Irvington High School]], [[Robertson High School (Fremont, California)|Robertson High School]], and [[John F. Kennedy High School (Fremont, California)|John F. Kennedy High School]].

===Mission San Jose District===
[[File:Chapel Courtyard of the Dominican Convent of Mission San José 4932.jpg|thumb|left|Dominican Convent of the Holy Rosary]]
At the time of the California Gold Rush, a boom town grew up around the old Mission, to equip and transport [[California Gold Rush#Forty-niners|49ers]] overland to the gold fields. A post office was opened at Mission San Jose in 1850.<ref name=CGN665>{{California's Geographic Names|665}}</ref>

The district, like Niles, is surrounded by hills. The hills are higher and steeper than Niles, with the highest points being on the [[Mission Peak|Mission Ridge]]. Mission San Jose district lies close to the northern two peaks, [[Mission Peak]] and [[Mount Allison]]. Mission Peak is very distinctive and is one of Fremont's emblems. These peaks go from 2,517 to {{convert|2604|ft|m|abbr=on}}, taller than [[Mount Tamalpais]], a great height for the San Francisco Bay Area. They see some deep snow occasionally.

Fremont's community college, [[Ohlone College]], is situated one block away from the mission and serves over 12,000 students.

Mission San Jose has the highest concentration of [[Asian American]]s in Fremont&nbsp;– over 50% of the population as of the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]]. The local high school is [[Mission San Jose High School]], ranked 67 in the nation by U.S. News & World Report. The median family income for the Mission San Jose area ([[ZIP code]] 94539) exceeded $114,595 in 2005. Owing to an influx of [[professionals]] and other affluent families seeking access to the top-performing local public schools, Mission San Jose's median home value reached $831,000 in 2006, earning the community a rank of 237 on [[Forbes]] magazine's list of the 500 most affluent communities in the United States.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/7/forbeslife-cx_07zip_94539_ZIP94539.html |title=#237 94539 |magazine=Forbes.com |date= September 13, 2007|access-date=September 9, 2010}}</ref>

The Warm Springs district is the southernmost portion of Fremont whose hub is the Warm Springs and Mission Boulevard intersection. It is located at {{Coord|37|29|14|N|121|55|45|W|name=Warm Springs}}, and lies at an elevation of {{convert|62|ft|m}}. Warm Springs has attracted the headquarters of many high-tech companies including [[Nielsen Norman Group]], [[Lam Research]], [[Corsair Gaming|Corsair]] and [[Lexar]] of the US as well as foreign high-tech companies such as [[Elitegroup Computer Systems]], and [[Asus]]. The district is also home to [[blue-collar]] industry. The San Jose mission is also present.

Warm Springs also serves as commercial center for the mainly residential Mission San Jose district, especially since the construction of [[Pacific Commons]], a large, modern regional shopping center. The Oakland Athletics talked about moving their stadium to this area.

===Media===

Founded in 2002, the ''[[Tri-City Voice]]'' serves Fremont and the nearby cities of Union City and Newark. The weekly is based in the Fremont, and publishes the city's legal notices.

==Government==

An elected mayor heads Fremont city government for a four-year term. The mayor chairs the city council, which has four elected council members in addition to the mayor. Two new seats have been added to the council beginning in 2018, for a total of seven seats when district-based elections are phased in. The council adopts the city's budget, and decides major policies. The city council appoints a city manager and city attorney. The city manager hires city staff, and manages day-to-day business. Advisory bodies work with the city council on some issues, to facilitate the council's final decisions. The mayor appoints advisory body members, subject to the approval of a majority of the council. Most members serve four-year terms of office without pay, with the exception of planning commissioners.

The City of Fremont directly provides services related to public safety, land use regulation, infrastructure maintenance, parks and recreation, and local social services. To provide these services, the city government is organized into 22 departments, from Animal Services to Transportation Engineering.

According to a 2009 financial report, city revenues were $280 million, expenditures $200 million, assets $1,200 million, cash and investments $340 million, and liabilities $260 million.<ref name="City of Fremont CAFR">[http://www.fremont.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=386 City of Fremont CAFR] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527170441/http://www.fremont.gov/DocumentView.aspx?DID=386 |date=May 27, 2010 }}. Retrieved August 10, 2009.</ref> As of 2015, the annual budget was $160 million and the city had 800 employees.<ref name="Grand Jury report" />

The city council has adopted a balanced budget by July 1 of each year. Budget problems have in some past years involved cuts in services, reductions in city staffing and wage concessions by labor unions.

Special districts provide water and sewer services for the city: [[Alameda County Water District]] and [[Union Sanitary District]]. A private contractor, [[Allied Waste]], provides garbage collection and recycling services to the city.

===Grand Jury investigation of record-keeping===
A Grand Jury in 2015 found that the city government did not comply with state law on public records,<ref name="Grand Jury report">{{cite web | url=http://www.acgov.org/grandjury/final2014-2015.pdf | title=2014-2015 Alameda County Grand Jury Report |pages= 85–92 |quote=The Grand Jury is deeply concerned with Fremont's loose interpretation of California government transparency and retention statutes and the city's apparent intentional efforts to exclude the public from accessing city emails ... The Grand Jury concludes that the city of Fremont's interpretation of California statutes cited in this report is contrary to the spirit of open and transparent government and must be changed. |date=June 30, 2015 |access-date=July 8, 2015 }}</ref> by deleting most emails after 30 days instead of the required two years. All emails were labeled automatically as "unsaved drafts" unless designated manually for retention. The city did not keep any record of councilmember emails, which used fremont.gov addresses and were relayed on to councilmembers' private email accounts. Though city officials held that automatic deletion would reduce data storage costs, the Grand Jury determined that the cost of complying with the state law would not be significant.<ref name="ebcitizen2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.ebcitizen.com/2015/06/grand-jury-fremont-defied-spirit-of.html|title=Grand jury: Fremont defied spirit of transparency with email retention policy|website=www.ebcitizen.com|access-date=April 20, 2018|date=June 30, 2015}}</ref><ref name="dailydemocrate2015">{{cite web|url=http://www.dailydemocrat.com/general-news/20150702/fremonts-email-retention-policy-subject-of-alameda-county-grand-jury-report|title=Fremont's email retention policy subject of Alameda County Grand Jury report|access-date=April 20, 2018|date=July 2, 2015}}</ref>

===District-based elections===
