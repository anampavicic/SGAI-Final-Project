'''Tegal''' is a city in the northwest part of Central Java of [[Indonesia]]. It is situated on the north coast (or ''pesisir'') of the province of [[Central Java]], about {{cvt|175|km}} from [[Semarang]], the capital of the province. It had a population of 239,599 at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 273,825 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as of mid-2023 was 262,781 (comprising 142,593 males and 140,188 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Tegal Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3376)</ref> 

The city is administratively separate from [[Tegal Regency]], which borders it to the south and east; [[Brebes Regency]] borders it to the west. Its built-up (''or metro'') area made up of Tegal Municipality and 12 districts spread over Tegal and Brebes Regencies was home to 1,410,124 inhabitants as at the 2010 census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 1,602,546 at the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 1,635,042.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Tegal Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3376)</ref> 

The [[Dutch East Indies]] colonial sugar industry originated in Tegal and the nearby city of [[Pekalongan]], approximately {{cvt|50|km}} to the east. Tegal Regency remained a major sugar production center until the mid-20th century.<ref>Knight, G.R. (1993) ''Colonial Production in Provincial Java. The Sugar Industry in Pekalongan-Tegal, 1800-1942''. Amsterdam: VU University Press.</ref> The city served as a port for exporting sugar produced on the nearby plantations. Tegal is famous for its [[warung]], commonly called "warteg" or warung tegal. It is also known for its tea products, such as [[teh botol]] Sosro, Tong Tji tea, 2 Tang tea, Gopek tea, and other brands.

== History ==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM De haven van Tegal Midden-Java TMnr 10007954.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Tegal (date unknown)]]
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Luchtfoto van suikerfabriek Pagongan in Tegal TMnr 60043485.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Pagongan sugar factory (ca.1928-40)]]
The city of Tegal developed from a small village called Tetegual. The modernization of the village began in the early 1530s, and it eventually became part of the [[Pekalongan Regency]], which admitted the existence of{{Clarify|date=November 2011}} the Pajang Empire in [[Central Java]]. The Pajang Empire was the successor of the [[Sultanate of Demak]].

The city was founded by Ki Gede Sebayu. Together with the local people, he aspired to increase the region's agriculture, exploiting its fertile soil. Because of his efforts to develop the region, he became the high leader and the symbol of the city. His coronation as leader was held simultaneously with a traditional festival celebrating a rich agricultural harvest. By district ordinance no. 5/1988, July 28 is the anniversary of the city of Tegal.

In the 1920s, the city was a center of activism for the [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] (PKI), and the radical leaders of the Tegal branch of the PKI were among the instigators of the 1926 rebellion that led to the temporary destruction of that party.<ref>McVey, Ruth. (1965) ''The rise of Indonesian communism''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press. pp 329-340.</ref>

On 8 October 1945, an anti-feudalism movement called ''Gerakan Tiga Daerah'' ("Three Regions Movement") was established in Tegal, Pekalongan, and [[Brebes, Brebes|Brebes]]. Its goal was to replace the blue-blood regents (related to the kings of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]]) with ordinary people. According to the leaders of this movement, the old regents cooperated with the Japanese during World War II and sent people to Japanese slave labor camps. The main leader of ''Gerakan Tiga Daerah'' was Sarjiyo, who became the new regent of Pekalongan. Others were Kutil, K. Mijaya and Ir. Sakirman. Ir Sakirman was the local leader of the PKI. The government of the Republic of Indonesia in Yogyakarta opposed ''Gerakan Tiga Daerah'' and declared it illegal.

''Gerakan Tiga Daerah'' had the old regents arrested, stripped naked, and dragged into prison. Other government officials and police officers were kidnapped and massacred at Talang Bridge. The ''Gerakan Tiga Daerah'' also provoked a racial riot against ethnic Chinese in Brebes. On 4 November 1945, the movement attacked the Indonesian army headquarters and the regent office in Pekalongan. The rebels were defeated by the Indonesian army in a fierce battle on 21 December 1945, and most of their leaders were arrested and imprisoned. This rebellion is called the Three Regions Affair.

During the unrest following the resignation of President [[Suharto]] in 1998, Tegal was the site of extensive protests and occasional violence against local government officials, especially in June 1998.

Tegal has faced issues relating to political corruption. In the late 2010s, two consecutive mayors of the city - [[Ikmal Jaya]] and [[Siti Masitha Soeparno]] - were both arrested by the [[Corruption Eradication Commission]] and convicted.<ref>[http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/08/29/kpk-arrests-tegal-mayor-siti-masitha.html KPK arrests Tegal mayor Siti Masitha] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210113092936/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2017/08/29/kpk-arrests-tegal-mayor-siti-masitha.html |date=2021-01-13 }}.

But since 1985, the center of government moved to Pendopo Ki Gede Sebayu former Pendopo Tegal regency, in the area of Alun-alun Mangkukusuman. Colonel Laut (Ret.) Adi Winarso, S. Sos is Tegal's first son who served as mayor for two periods, 1999 - 2004 and 2004 - 2009 through an indirect election. The year 2008 marks a new history of the leadership of Tegal City, because in that year also for the first time, a mayor and deputy mayor were directly elected by the people of Tegal City.

==Language==
Tegal<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tegal.us/ |title=tegal.us - Registered at Namecheap.com |website=www.tegal.us |access-date=2017-11-24 |archive-date=2018-09-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180905095141/http://www.tegal.us/ |url-status=live }}</ref> has its language, known as ''Bahasa Tegal''. Tegal language has a resemblance to the language of Banyumas ( ngapak ) that is in the vocabulary. However, people in Tegal are reluctant to use ''ngapak'' as a term of the language, due to their dialectical difference. People using the Tegal language include the northern part of the Tegal regency, Tegal City, the western part of the Pemalang regency, and the eastern part of the Brebes district. The first Tegal language Congress was held by the Tegal City government on April 4, 2006, at the Bahari Inn hotel. The event which was initiated by Yono Daryono presented several figures such as SN Ratmana (cerpenis), Ki Enthus Susmono (dalang Tegal), Eko Tunas (Tegal poet), Dwi Ery Santoso (Poetry and Director). The purpose of the congress was to raise the status of the Tegalan dialect into the Tegal language. Some Indonesian comedians speak it because its accent and dialect arouse amusement. One example is the translation of the greeting phrase "How are you?" into "Kepriben kabare?".

===Greetings===
It is common practice for people in Tegal to call their friends "Jon", "Jack" or "Jakwir". The translation for "Daddy" is ''Jasak'', "Mommy" is ''Jok'', a younger brother is addressed as ''Yarig,'' and an older brother is ''Sahang''. Many other words can only be understood by native Tegals. Bahasa Tegal also has many Arabic loan words.
