==History==
{{morerefs-section|date=February 2017}}
The [[Yamato (people)|Yamato people]] settled in Mito around the 4th century CE. Around the end of the [[Heian period]], [[Baba Sukemoto]], a warlord of the [[Taira|Heike]] clan, moved to Mito and built a castle there. [[Mito Castle]] changed hands several times after that; coming under the control of the [[Satake clan]] won it in [[Sengoku period]], but the Satake were forced to surrender it to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] in 1603 after the [[Battle of Sekigahara]]. Ieyasu's son [[Tokugawa Yorifusa]] was then given Mito Castle, becoming head of one of the three "[[gosanke]]" branches of the clan qualified to provide a new [[shōgun]] should the main family line fail. During this period, Mito was the seat of the so-called [[Mitogaku|Mito School]], a congregation of nativist scholars of [[Confucianism|Confucian]] persuasion led by [[Aizawa Seishisai]], who during the 18th and 19th centuries advocated [[rangaku|Western learning]] as a means not only to further Japanese technological development and international strength, but as means to prove [[kokugaku|Japanese uniqueness]] and superiority among nations. The [[Kōdōkan (Mito)|Kōdōkan]] was the largest of the [[han schools]]. The capital of [[Edo]] was directly connected to Mito by the [[Mito Kaidō]].<ref name="chiba">[http://www.ktr.mlit.go.jp/chiba/limit/rekishi/03/index.htm Chiba Kokaidō Rekishi Sanpo]. Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport. Accessed December 28, 2007.</ref> The Tokugawa ruled Mito until the [[Meiji Restoration]].

The city of Mito was formed on April 1, 1889, with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. It was one of the first 31 cities to be established in Japan. With a population of 25,000, it was designated as the prefectural capital of Ibaraki Prefecture. By 1900, the [[Jōban Line]] connected Mito to Tokyo, and by 1910, telephones and electric lighting were available throughout the city. More than three-quarters of the city was burned to the ground during the [[Bombing of Mito in World War II|Mito air raid]] of August 2, 1945, just before the end of [[World War II]].

The borders of Mito expanded in 1955 through 1958 through the annexation of the neighboring villages of Kamiono, Watari, Yoshida, Sakedo, Kawawada, Yanagawa, Kunita and Iitomi and Akatsuka. The village of Tsunezumi was annexed in 1992. In 2001, Mito was designated a [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] with increased local autonomy. The neighboring town of Uchihara was annexed in 2005. The city suffered from severe damage in the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] with 25,982 houses completely or partially destroyed; however, there were only two fatalities.

Mito was designated a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]], with further increases in local autonomy on April 4, 2020.

==Government==
Mito has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Mito contributes six members to the Ibaraki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Ibaraki 1st district]] and the  [[Ibaraki 2nd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Mito is primarily a regional commercial center and administrative city as most industry in Ibaraki is concentrated around the nearby cities of [[Tsukuba, Ibaraki|Tsukuba]] and [[Hitachi, Ibaraki|Hitachi]]. Mito has a modest but thriving tourism industry, centered on the Kairaku-en gardens and local museums dedicated to the Tokugawa family.
