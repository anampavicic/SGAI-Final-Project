Bellevue is home to some of the world's largest technology companies.

==History==
The [[Duwamish people|Duwamish]], whose main settlements were located in present-day Renton and Seattle, maintained a small outpost settlement called Satskal (''SAH-tsah-kahl'') along the [[Mercer Slough]], south of present-day downtown Bellevue.<ref name=neiwert28>{{Cite book| last = Neiwert | first = David | title = Strawberry Days | url = https://archive.org/details/strawberrydaysho00neiw_0 | url-access = registration | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2005 | page = [https://archive.org/details/strawberrydaysho00neiw_0/page/28 28] | isbn = 978-1403967923}}</ref> It was from this village that an attack on the settlers of Elliott Bay was staged. The Duwamish also had a village near Factoria called 'pah-pah-DEEL'.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 13, 2019|title=Village Descriptions--Duwamish-Seattle|url=http://coastsalishmap.org/Village_Descriptions_Duwamish-Seattle.htm#17|access-date=August 30, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190913221956/http://coastsalishmap.org/Village_Descriptions_Duwamish-Seattle.htm#17|archive-date=September 13, 2019}}</ref>

Bellevue was first settled by European Americans in 1869 by William Meydenbauer and Aaron Mercer, who claimed homestead tracts several miles apart. Both moved away within a few years, and permanent residents did not arrive until 1879. By 1882, a community, consisting mostly of logging homesteaders, had established itself.<ref name=neiwert28/> Once the land had been logged, it was gradually cleared, largely by Japanese immigrant labor in the early 20th century, to support small-scale farming on leased land plots.<ref name=neiwert31>{{Cite book| last = Neiwert | first = David | title = Strawberry Days | url = https://archive.org/details/strawberrydaysho00neiw_0 | url-access = registration | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2005 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/strawberrydaysho00neiw_0/page/11 11], 31 | isbn = 978-1403967923}}</ref>

By the early part of the 20th century, Bellevue had acquired a reputation as a weekend getaway destination for Seattle residents, who would arrive by ferry at Meydenbauer Bay and spend the day at nearby Wildwood Park.<ref name=neiwert68>{{Cite book| last = Neiwert | first = David | title = Strawberry Days | url = https://archive.org/details/strawberrydaysho00neiw_0 | url-access = registration | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2005 | page = [https://archive.org/details/strawberrydaysho00neiw_0/page/68 68] | isbn = 978-1403967923}}</ref> After the ferry landing was moved to [[Medina, Washington|Medina]], however, tourism to Bellevue waned. To counter this decline, the Bellevue Strawberry Festival was conceived of in 1925, and by the 1930s it had grown to attract as many as 15,000 visitors. At the time, Bellevue was still a small town with around 2,000 residents.<ref name=neiwert69>{{Cite book| last = Neiwert | first = David | title = Strawberry Days | url = https://archive.org/details/strawberrydaysho00neiw_0 | url-access = registration | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2005 | page = [https://archive.org/details/strawberrydaysho00neiw_0/page/69 69] | isbn = 978-1403967923}}</ref>

Prior to the opening of the [[Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge|Lake Washington Floating Bridge]] in 1940, Bellevue was mostly rural farmland area with little development. Although it was small, developers were pushing to change that; in the 1920s, [[James S. Ditty]] predicted that it would become a city with a population of 200,000.<ref name=future>Welch, Bob.

In 1942, the Bellevue Strawberry Festival was cancelled. The primary reason was that some 90 percent of the agricultural workforce in the area was of Japanese ancestry, and all of these farmers and their families had been forcibly [[Internment of Japanese Americans|interned in camps]] following the start of World War II.<ref name=neiwert155>{{Cite book| last = Neiwert | first = David | title = Strawberry Days | url = https://archive.org/details/strawberrydaysho00neiw_0 | url-access = registration | publisher = Palgrave Macmillan | year = 2005 | page = [https://archive.org/details/strawberrydaysho00neiw_0/page/155 155]| isbn = 978-1403967923}}</ref> The fair would not be revived for another 45 years.

Bellevue remains one of the largest cities in the state, with several high-rise structures in its core and a burgeoning business community. The city experienced a building boom during the mid-2000s, with the building of developments such as [[Lincoln Square (Bellevue)|Lincoln Square]] and the Bravern.<ref name="city_history" />

[[Bellevue Square]] is located in downtown Bellevue and is now one of the largest [[shopping center]]s in the region. Opened in 1946,<ref name="city_history" /> the mall has undergone several significant phases of expansion since the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=March 2021}}

The city's plans include the Bel-Red Corridor Project, a large-scale planning effort to encourage the redevelopment of the large [[Bel-Red, Bellevue|Bel-Red]] section of the city bordering the adjacent city of [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]] which is a major employment area in the city.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.ci.bellevue.wa.us/bel-red_intro.htm | title = Bel-Red Area Transformation | publisher = City of Bellevue | access-date = July 18, 2008 |url-status=dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161130204932/http://ci.bellevue.wa.us/bel-red_intro.htm | archive-date = November 30, 2016}}</ref> Patterned after the redevelopment of the downtown core, plans include [[Superblock (urban planning)|superblock]] [[Mixed-use development|mixed-use]] projects similar to [[Lincoln Square (Bellevue)|Lincoln Square]], premised on private construction and the development of infrastructure such as the [[2 Line (Sound Transit)|2 Line]] of [[Link light rail]] that will extend to the Eastside.{{Citation needed |date=March 2021}}

==Geography==
Bellevue lies between [[Lake Washington]] to the west and the smaller [[Lake Sammamish]] to the east. Much of Bellevue is drained by the [[Kelsey Creek (Washington)|Kelsey Creek]] watershed, whose source is located in the [[Larsen Lake]] and [[Phantom Lake]] [[green belt]] and whose outlet is near where [[Interstate 90 in Washington|Interstate 90]] meets Lake Washington's eastern shore. The city is bisected by [[Interstate 405 (Washington)|Interstate 405]] running north–south, and the southern portion is crossed from west to east by Interstate 90. The [[Washington State Route 520|State Route 520]] freeway roughly delineates the upper reaches of Bellevue.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|37.505|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|33.468|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|4.037|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="CenPopGazetteer2023"/>

The city's name is derived from a [[French language|French]] term for "beautiful view". Under favorable weather conditions, scenic vistas of the [[Olympic Mountains]] and [[Cascade Mountains]] can be viewed from hilltops (and strategically positioned high-rise buildings) within the incorporated city.

South of I-90, the city continues up [[Cougar Mountain]], at the top of which is an unincorporated King County location called Hilltop. To the west of Cougar Mountain, Bellevue includes the [[Coal Creek (Washington)|Coal Creek]], Somerset, and [[Factoria, Bellevue|Factoria]] neighborhoods.

Bellevue is bordered by the cities of [[Kirkland, Washington|Kirkland]] to the north and [[Redmond, Washington|Redmond]] to the northeast along the [[Overlake]] and [[Crossroads, Bellevue|Crossroads]] neighborhoods. Across the short [[East Channel Bridge]], I-90 connects Bellevue to [[Mercer Island]] to the southwest. [[Issaquah, Washington|Issaquah]] is to the east, down I-90 at the south end of Lake Sammamish. The city is bordered to the west by many affluent suburbs such as [[Medina, Washington|Medina]], [[Clyde Hill, Washington|Clyde Hill]], [[Hunts Point, Washington|Hunts Point]] and [[Yarrow Point, Washington|Yarrow Point]]. The south end of Bellevue is bordered by the city of [[Renton, Washington|Renton]], and to the southeast, the relatively recently incorporated city of [[Newcastle, Washington|Newcastle]].
