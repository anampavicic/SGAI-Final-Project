'''Kalyani''' is a [[Planned Community|planned]] urban city in [[Nadia district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[West Bengal]]. It is also a municipality and Community Development Block in Nadia. It is located around 40 kilometers from [[Kolkata]]&nbsp;— the capital of [[West Bengal]]. Kalyani is the administrative headquarters of [[Kalyani subdivision]]. It resides on the eastern banks of [[Hooghly River]], and is part of the [[Kolkata Metropolitan Development Authority]] (KMDA).

During the period of [[World War II]], the surroundings of the then ''Chandamari'' village was used as an [[air base]] by the [[United States Army Air Forces]], and was known by the name of "Roosevelt Town" or "Roosevelt Nagar", after then [[US President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Later, after the [[surrender of Japan]] and the [[independence of India]], the air base was abandoned. On the same area, a planned town named "Kalyani" was developed by the [[Government of West Bengal]] in 1951 on the behest of [[Bidhan Chandra Roy]] – the second [[List of Chief Ministers of West Bengal|Chief Minister of West Bengal]] – for hosting the [[Indian National Congress]] meeting and to accommodate the housing needs of the growing population of Calcutta. Kalyani, being a planned town, is characterized by underground sewage system, paved roads forming rectangular grids, tree-lined avenues and community parks. 

Kalyani has a dedicated industrial zone including [[Andrew Yule and Company]], Kalyani Breweries ([[UB Group]]), Black Label beer and [[Dabur]], [[TDK]], though many of the industries have either closed or stopped production. It is an important centre of education in West Bengal, with two universities ([[University of Kalyani]] and [[Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya]]), [[IISER Kolkata|IISER]], [[Indian Institute of Information Technology, Kalyani|IIIT Kalyani]], [[All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Kalyani]], [[College of Medicine & JNM Hospital]], [[Kalyani Government Engineering College]] and other institutes of higher education and research. [[Kalyani Stadium]] has emerged as an alternative location to [[Kolkata]] for holding numerous [[I-League]] football matches and other sporting events. The Bengal Cricket Academy and a stadium have been established by [[Cricket Association of Bengal]] in Kalyani for promotion and development of cricket.<ref name=cricacademy>{{cite news|title=CAB's first cricket academy inaugurated|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/new-zealand-in-india-2016/top-stories/cabs-first-cricket-academy-inaugurated/articleshow/9862464.cms|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821002920/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-04/top-stories/30112129_1_nca-national-cricket-academy-sandip-patil|url-status=live|archive-date=21 August 2013|access-date=8 May 2013|newspaper=[[The Times of India]]|date=4 September 2011}}</ref>

==History==
Kalyani, located in Nadia district in the state of West Bengal, is a relatively young town. During the [[Second World War]], Kalyani, was the site of an [[List of United States military bases|American military airbase]], formed out of 45 villages in the district of Nadia.<ref name=kalyanihistory>{{cite news|last1=Bhattacharya|first1=Bitan|title=সামরিক শহরের স্মৃতি নিয়ে বেড়ে উঠেছে কল্যাণী|url=http://www.anandabazar.com/district/nodia-murshidabbad/%E0%A6%B8-%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%95-%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%B9%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%B8-%E0%A6%AE-%E0%A6%A4-%E0%A6%A8-%E0%A7%9F-%E0%A6%AC-%E0%A7%9C-%E0%A6%89%E0%A6%A0-%E0%A6%9B-%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%AF-%E0%A6%A3-1.104947|access-date=1 August 2015|publisher=Ananda Bazar Patrika|date=13 January 2015}}</ref>

The military garrison town was named after the then-sitting [[President of the United States]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] as "Roosevelt Town" or "Roosevelt ''Nagar''", with "nagar" meaning "town" in many [[Indo-Aryan languages]], including [[Bengali language|Bengali]]. Hangars and other reminders of the airfield are still visible in the 'A' Block and some areas around Kalyani University, whose buildings were built on or over the runways.<ref name="kalyanihistory" /> After [[World War II]], the [[United States Army Air Forces|United States Army Air Force]] left the base, and the airfield and hangars went into disuse.

The development of modern Kalyani is credited to the former [[Chief Minister of West Bengal]], [[Bidhan Chandra Roy]]. After the [[independence of India]] in 1947, the master plan of the town was developed and the foundation stone for the town was laid by the then Governor of West Bengal, [[Kailashnath Katju]], on 24 February 1951.<ref name="kalyanihistory" /> The town was built quickly in order to host the 59th [[Indian National Congress]] meeting in 1954. In memoriam of that conference, a road of the town was named as 'Congress Road'. In 1957, the Kalyani police station was formed, and in 1979, the rail line was extended from [[Kalyani main railway station|Kalyani Central]] to [[Kalyani Simanta railway station|Kalyani Simanta station]], and also established direct connectivity to Kolkata through Kalyani Simanta local EMU trains.<ref name="kalyanihistory" />

In 1995, the Kalyani Municipality was established, which has been crucial in the development of infrastructure in Kalyani.<ref name=kalyanihistory /> In 2014, Kalyani was selected as a candidate for a "Smart City" project. Although this project has since been abandoned by the State Government.

==Geography and urban structure==
Kalyani is located in the [[Nadia district]] of [[West Bengal]], within the [[Kolkata metropolitan area]]. Kalyani lies along the east bank of the [[Hooghly River]], within the upper [[Ganges Delta]]. As with most of the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], the soil and water are predominantly [[alluvium|alluvial]] in origin. Kalyani is located over the "Bengal basin", a pericratonic tertiary basin.<ref name="soil characterization">{{cite conference |url=http://gndec.ac.in/~igs/ldh/conf/2009/articles/T01_03.pdf |title= Characterization of soil over Kolkata municipal area|first1=Diptendra |last1= Das|first2=B.C.|last2=Chattopadhyay |date= 17–19 December 2009|conference=Indian Geotechnical Conference |conference-url= http://gndec.ac.in/~igs/ldh/conf/2009/|volume= 1 |location= Guntur, India|pages=11–12 |access-date=19 November 2012 }}</ref> According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], on a scale ranging from {{nowrap|I to V}} in order of increasing susceptibility to earthquakes, the city lies inside [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone III]];<ref name=hazardprofile>{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/hazardprofile.pdf|title=Hazard profiles of Indian districts|access-date=23 August 2006|work=National Capacity Building Project in Disaster Management |publisher=[[UNDP]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519100611/http://www.undp.org.in/dmweb/hazardprofile.pdf|archive-date=19 May 2006}}</ref> according to a [[United Nations Development Programme]] report, its wind and cyclone zone is "very high damage risk".<ref name=hazardprofile/>

Kalyani is a planned city, having underground drainage systems, tree-lined avenues, community parks, paved roads intersecting each other at 90-degree angle. The city itself is divided into four blocks&nbsp;— Block A, Block B, Block C and Block D, which are further divided into sub-blocks. Block A and B are mostly residential in character with commercial markets. Main Post Office, Industrial Training Institute, Government offices and the Public Library along with offices of major Banks are situated in Block B. Whereas the Kalyani main station, State General Hospital, Medical college are situated in A Block. Block C and Block D are located to the north of Kalyani Simanta branch line. Block C is reserved for institutional use and is largely occupied by the [[Kalyani University]] and [[Kalyani Government Engineering College]]. Block D is the industrial zone, consisting of many small and medium-sized industries.

In June 2015, the Government of West Bengal declared establishment of an "Analytics City" name ''Samriddhi'' in Kalyani, besides Uditi Government Housing Project which was projected to attract investments of more than Rs 3,000 crore in next three years.<ref name="analytics city">{{cite news|title=West Bengal to develop analytics-themed city near Kalyani township|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-06-19/news/63616930_1_bcc-state-government-52-acres|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150626124249/http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-06-19/news/63616930_1_bcc-state-government-52-acres|url-status=dead|archive-date=26 June 2015|access-date=25 June 2015|publisher=Economic Times|date=19 June 2015}}</ref> In the first phase, being developed over 52 acres off Kalyani Expressway, the hub will accommodate academic, residential and commercial centers apart from real estate projects.<ref name="analytics city" />
