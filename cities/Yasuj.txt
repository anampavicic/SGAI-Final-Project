==History==
The area of Yasuj had been settled as early as the [[Bronze Age]]. Findings include the Martyrs Hills (dating from 3rd millennium BC), the Khosravi Hill from the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenian period]], the ancient site of Gerd, the Pataveh bridge, and the Pay-e Chol cemetery. Yasuj is the place where [[Alexander III of Macedon]] and his [[Macedon]]ian forces stormed the ''[[Persian Gates]]'' (''Darvazeh-ye Fars''), and found a way into the [[Fars Province|Persian heartland]] (331 BC).<ref>Henry Speck, "Alexander at the Persian Gates. A Study in Historiography and Topography" in: ''American Journal of Ancient History'' n.s. 1.1 (2002) 15-234; summarized at [https://www.livius.org/a/iran/persian_gates/yasuj.html "Persian Gates"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418084627/https://www.livius.org/a/iran/persian_gates/yasuj.html |date=18 April 2009 }}</ref>

The Yasuj Museum, which opened in 2002, displays coins, statues, pottery, and bronze vessels recovered from surrounding archaeological sites.<ref>[http://iiny.org/list.asp?lang=3&t=Text_Only&gid=990 "Museum And National Parks" Islamic Institute of New York] accessed 18 August 2008</ref>

==Climate==
Yasuj has the typical continental-influenced [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csa'') of western Iran, though because of its location in the direct line of rain-bearing winds from the Persian Gulf it is the wettest Iranian city south of the Alborz Mountains with an annual rainfall nine times that of [[Isfahan]] and twice that of [[Kermanshah]]. The heavy precipitation allows the existence of small [[glacier]]s on the highest Zagros peaks &ndash; in contrast the Kuhrud Mountains to the east have no glaciers despite being of the same height due to aridity. The long dry season sees only on average {{convert|4|mm|in}} of rainfall between June and September, with the wet season extending into October, unlike many other Mediterranean climates.
