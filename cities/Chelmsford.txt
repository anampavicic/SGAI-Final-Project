==History==
[[File:Chelmsfordcath.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Chelmsford Cathedral]]]]

===Early history===
Before 1199, there were settlements nearby from ancient times. The remains of a [[Neolithic]] and a late [[Bronze Age]] settlement have been found in the Springfield suburb, and the town was occupied by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]]. A Roman fort was built in AD 60, and a civilian town grew up around it. The town was given the name of '''Caesaromagus''' (''Caesar's field'' or ''Caesar's marketplace''), although the reason for it being given the great honour of bearing the Imperial prefix is now unclear – possibly as a failed 'planned town' provincial capital to replace [[Londinium]] or [[Colchester|Camulodunum]]{{Citation needed|reason=Surely as one of Ceaser's military camps during his campaign through Essex is a better explanation?|date=July 2024}}. The remains of a ''[[mansio]]'', a combination post office, civic centre and hotel, lie beneath the streets of modern [[Moulsham]], and the ruins of an octagonal temple are located beneath the Odeon roundabout. The town disappeared for a while after the Romans left Britain.{{Citation needed|reason=Disappeared for a while?|date=July 2024}}

An Anglo-Saxon burial was discovered at [[Broomfield, Essex|Broomfield]] to the north of Chelmsford in the late 19th century and the finds are now in the [[British Museum]]. The road 'Saxon Way' now marks the site.

The city's name is derived from ''Ceolmaer's [[Ford (crossing)|ford]]''{{Citation needed|reason=Is this undisputed?|date=July 2024}} which was close to the site of the present High Street stone bridge. In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, the town was called ''Celmeresfort'' and by 1189 it had changed to ''Chelmsford''. Its position on the Londinium – Camulodonum [[Roman road]] (the modern [[A12 road (England)|A12]]) ensured the early prosperity of Chelmsford.

===Royal charter===

On 7 September 1199, following the commissioning of a bridge over the [[River Can]] by [[Maurice (Bishop of London)|Maurice, Bishop of London]], King [[John of England|John]] granted to [[William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise]] a [[royal charter]] for Chelmsford to hold a market, marking the origin of the modern town. An under-cover market, operating Tuesday to Saturday, is still an important part of the city centre over 800 years later.

The town became the seat of the local assize during the early 13th century (though assizes were also held at [[Brentwood, Essex|Brentwood]]) and by 1218 it was recognised as the county town of Essex, a position it has retained to the present day.

===Royal connections===

King [[Robert I of Scotland]], better known as [[Robert the Bruce]] (1274–1329), had close ties with the nearby village of [[Writtle]] and there is some evidence to suggest he was born at Montpeliers Farm in the village,<ref name=RB_Birth>Robert's [[absolution]] for Comyn's murder, in 1310, gives Robert as a layman of Carrick, indicating Carrick / Turnberry was either his primary residence, or place of birth. [[Lochmaben]] has a claim, as a possession of the Bruce family, but is not supported by a medieval source. The contemporary claims of Essex / the Bruce estate at [[Writtle]] Essex, during the coronation of Edward, have been discounted by [[G. W. S. Barrow]].</ref><ref name=birth2>[[Geoffrey the Baker|Geoffrey le Baker's]]: [https://archive.org/details/chronicongalfrid00bakeuoft Chronicon Galfridi le Baker de Swynebroke] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160831232310/https://archive.org/details/chronicongalfrid00bakeuoft |date=31 August 2016 }}, ed.

Baker, cited above, is mentioned with other authorities,</ref> but the story is disputed and possibly conflated with his father, [[Robert de Brus, 6th Lord of Annandale]].

Chelmsford was significantly involved in the [[Peasants' Revolt]] of 1381, and King [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] moved on to the town after quelling the rebellion in London. 'The Sleepers and The Shadows', written by Hilda Grieve in 1988 using original sources, states: "For nearly a week, from Monday 1st July to Saturday 6th July [1381], Chelmsford became the seat of government ... The king probably lodged at his nearby manor house at Writtle. He was attended by his council, headed by the temporary Chancellor ... the new chief justice ... the royal chancery ... Their formidable task in Chelmsford was to draft, engross, date, seal and despatch by messengers riding to the farthest corners of the realm, the daily batches of commissions, mandates, letters, orders and proclamations issued by the government not only to speed the process of pacification of the kingdom, but to conduct much ordinary day-to-day business of the Crown and Government." Richard II famously revoked the charters which he had made in concession to the peasants on 2 July 1381, while in Chelmsford. It could be said that given this movement of government power, Chelmsford for a few days at least became the capital of England. Many of the ringleaders of the revolt were executed on the gallows at what is now [[Primrose Hill]].

King [[Henry VIII]] purchased the Boleyn estate in 1516, and built [[Palace of Beaulieu|Beaulieu Palace]] on the current site of [[New Hall School]]. This later became the residence of his then mistress, and later wife [[Anne Boleyn|Anne]]. Soon after it became the residence of Henry's daughter, by his first marriage, [[Mary I of England|Mary I]].

===Witchfinder General===

In the 17th century many of the victims of [[Matthew Hopkins]] (the self-styled "Witchfinder General") spent their last days imprisoned in Chelmsford, before being tried at the Assizes<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/legacies/myths_legends/england/essex/ | title=BBC – Legacies – Myths and Legends – England – Essex – Witch-finder witch? }}</ref> and hanged for [[witchcraft]].

===Charles Dickens===

In 1835, when visiting Essex and Suffolk to cover local elections, [[Charles Dickens]] visited Chelmsford. He was apparently so upset that he could not find a newspaper on a Sunday that he wrote in a letter to a friend that Chelmsford was "the dullest and most stupid place on earth".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Russell|first=Steven|date=7 February 2012|title='The dullest and most stupid place on earth...'

===Birthplace of radio===

* In 1899 [[Guglielmo Marconi]] opened the first "wireless" or radio factory in the world at Hall Street in the [[Moulsham]] area of Chelmsford. 
* In 1920 Marconi made the first official publicised sound broadcast in the United Kingdom, featuring Dame [[Nellie Melba]] at the [[New Street Works]], the first purpose-built radio factory in the world. 
* In 1922, Marconi made the world's first regular wireless broadcasts for entertainment (call sign "[[2MT]]") began from the nearby village of [[Writtle]]. 
Station [[2MT]] led to the creation of its sister station in London "[[2LO]]", which subsequently led to the creation of the [[BBC]].

===Bishopric===
In 1914 Chelmsford's church became a cathedral (see below) and the town got its own bishop.

===World War II===
During World War II Chelmsford, an important centre of light engineering war production, was attacked from the air on several occasions, both by aircraft of the [[Luftwaffe]] and by missile. The worst single loss of life took place on Tuesday 19 December 1944, when the 367th [[Vergeltungswaffe]] 2 or [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rocket to hit England fell on Henry Road, a residential street near the Hoffmans ball bearing factory and the [[Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company]] factory in New Street. Both factories were key to the war effort. Thirty-nine people were killed and 138 injured, 47 seriously.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chelmsfordwarmemorial.co.uk/WW2/WW2_HOWSE,_Pamela_Christine.html |title=Pamela Christine HOWSE, Civilian.

A monument to the dead is located in the city cemetery on Writtle Road.

On 14 May 1943 Luftwaffe bombing raids hit Chelmsford leaving more than 50 people dead<ref>{{cite news |title=Beryl Ina JUDD, Civilian Fatally injured during an air raid at King's Road, Chelmsford. Aged 11 |url=https://www.chelmsfordwarmemorial.co.uk/second-world-war/chelmsford/ww2-judd-beryl-ina.html |access-date=30 December 2022 |work=Chelmsford War Memorial}}</ref> and leaving nearly 1,000 homeless. The bombs hit mainly the town centre, [[Springfield, Essex|Springfield]], and [[Moulsham]].

The [[GHQ Line]] part of the [[British hardened field defences of World War II]] runs directly through Chelmsford with many [[Pillbox (military)|pillboxes]] still in existence to the north and south of the city.

[[Hylands Park]], the site of the former annual [[V Festival]], hosted a prisoner of war camp, and from 1944 until it was disbanded in 1945, was the headquarters of the [[Special Air Service]] (SAS).<ref>[http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/history-hylands The History of Hylands] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404214844/http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/history-hylands |date=4 April 2016 }}, Chelmsford City Council, published 24 November 2004. Retrieved 20 October 2010</ref>

===Recent history===
Since the 1980s defence-related industries in the city have declined, most notably the [[Marconi Company]] with all of its factories either being closed or sold. The site on West Hanningfield Road was sold to [[BAE Systems]]; the Waterhouse Lane site sold to E2V and the former [[New Street Works]] site has undergone major redevelopment for residential/mixed use.<ref>{{cite web|title=Former Marconi site, New Street|url=http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/marconi|access-date=11 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404141706/http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/marconi|archive-date=4 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The one-time largest employer in Chelmsford, RHP (the former Hoffman ball bearing manufacturer), closed its New Street/Rectory Lane site in 1989. Some of the factory was converted into luxury apartments and a health club although most of the site was demolished to make way for the Rivermead Campus of the [[Anglia Ruskin University]].

The city's location close to London and at the centre of Essex has helped it grow in importance as a financial, administrative and distribution centre.

The Channels Development, Beaulieu Park, The Village and Chancellor Park are some of the most recent large-scale housing developments built in the city. The local plan targets an additional 18,000 new homes by 2036, in developments largely to the north of the city.<ref>{{cite web|title= Adopted Local Plan |url=https://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/planning-and-building-control/planning-policy-and-new-local-plan/new-local-plan/adopted-local-plan/|access-date=19 April 2021}}</ref>

=== Business and commerce ===
[[File:highchelmer.jpeg|thumb|High Chelmer Shopping Centre prior to the 2009 refurbishment.]]

Originally an agricultural and market town, Chelmsford has been an important centre for industry since the 19th century. Following the opening of the [[Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation]] in 1797, cheaper transportation and raw materials made milling and malting the main industries until the 1850s, when increasing prosperity created a local market for agricultural machinery.

Foundries and engineering works followed including Fell Christy at his Factory (In later years known as Christy Norris Ltd) on the corner of Kings Road and Broomfield Road opened 1858, closed 1985, Coleman and Moreton, Thomas Clarkson (''Steam'' Omnibus manufacturer and Founder of the Eastern National Bus Company) and Eddington and Stevenson (makers of traction engines). The Company Christy Norris still survives, trading as Christy Turner Ltd based in [[Ipswich]].

{{Main|Marconi Company}}
In 1899, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] opened the world's first "wireless" factory under the name 'The Marconi Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company' in Hall Street, employing around 50 people. The company was later called the [[Marconi Company|Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company]] Ltd. For this reason Chelmsford is credited as the "birthplace of radio", and this phrase can be seen on administrative signs on major roads entering the city, although this statement is disputed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_whoradio.html |title=Tesla – Master of Lightning: Who Invented Radio? |publisher=PBS |access-date=17 September 2010}}</ref>

Outgrowing its Hall Street premises, Marconi moved to the purpose-built {{convert|70000|sqft|m2|adj=on|abbr=off}} [[New Street Works]] in June 1912. On 15 June 1920 the factory hosted the first official publicised sound [[broadcasting|broadcast]] in the United Kingdom, featuring Dame [[Nellie Melba]] and using two {{convert|450|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=off}} radio broadcasting masts.

In 1922, the world's first regular wireless broadcasts for entertainment began from the Marconi laboratories at [[Writtle]] near Chelmsford – Call sign '[[2MT]]' in what was little more than a wooden hut.

In 1999, Marconi's defence division, including the Chelmsford facilities, was purchased by [[British Aerospace]] to form [[BAE Systems]]. Two sites remain under BAE control; the Great Baddow site which is now BAE's Advanced Technology Centre and its [[BAE Systems Integrated System Technologies|Integrated Systems Technologies]] business at Glebe Road.

The military and secure communications division of Marconi was merged into Selex Communications based at the New Street factory. They vacated the site in April 2008 with the remaining operations moved to nearby [[Basildon]], bringing to an end more than 100 years of the Marconi name in Chelmsford.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chelmsfordweeklynews.co.uk/archive/2001/04/30/Essex+Archive/5491406.Chelmsford__Marconi_moving_after_a_century/ |title=Chelmsford: Marconi moving after a century (From Chelmsford Weekly News) |publisher=Chelmsfordweeklynews.co.uk |access-date=21 April 2012}}</ref>

===Cromptons Electrical Engineering===
Chelmsford became home to the United Kingdom's first electrical engineering works established by [[R. E. B. Crompton|Rookes Evelyn Bell Crompton]]. Crompton was a leading authority on electrical engineering, and pioneered electric street lighting and electric traction motors within the United Kingdom. He installed electric street lights in the town centre to celebrate the incorporation of the Borough of Chelmsford in 1888. Although this made Chelmsford one of the earliest towns to receive electric street lighting, the Council later removed it because gas from the Council owned gasworks was cheaper. Crompton supplied the traction motors for the first electric trains on [[Southend Pier]]. The company manufactured electrical switchgear, alternators and generators for many [[power stations]] in the UK and worldwide.

Crompton set up his original factory known as the 'Arc Works' in Queen Street in 1878. After a fire there in 1895,<ref name="essexcc1">{{cite web |url=http://unlockingessex.essexcc.gov.uk/custom_pages/monument_detail.asp?content_page_id=89&monument_id=1031913&content_parents=61,80 |title=Seax Archeaology – Unlocking Essex's Past |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |access-date=30 August 2009 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> he built a huge new electrical engineering factory also called the 'Arc Works' in Writtle Road. Crompton and Co. became [[Crompton Parkinson]] in 1927 when Colonel Crompton partnered with fellow electrical engineer [[Frank Parkinson]]. During [[World War II]], the factory was frequently targeted by the [[Luftwaffe]]. In 1969 a takeover by [[Hawker Siddeley]] saw Crompton Parkinson Ltd downsized and operations moved elsewhere. The [[Marconi Company]] took over the site which became the base for the newly formed Marconi Radar Systems.<ref>Simons, R. & Sutherland, J., ''[http://www.radarpages.co.uk/download/p172.pdf Forty Years of Marconi Radar from 1946 to 1986] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001730/http://www.radarpages.co.uk/download/p172.pdf |date=4 March 2016 }}'', GEC Review, (1998). Retrieved 24 December 2007.</ref>

After years of decline, the Marconi factory closed in 1992<ref name="essexcc1"/> and the site was demolished a few years later apart from the frontage on Writtle Road. 'The Village' housing development now occupies the site with road names such as ''Rookes'' Crescent, ''Evelyn'' Place, ''Crompton'' Street and ''Parkinson'' Drive as tributes to the former occupant.

=== Hoffmann Ball Bearings ===
Hoffmann Ball bearings was a major employer in Chelmsford in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. They produced ball bearings which were used for early transatlantic flight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hoffmannbearings.co.uk/history-of-hoffmann-bearings.html|title=History of Hoffmann Bearings – All Hoffmann Bearings or Replacement Hoffmann Bearings Available|website=hoffmannbearings.co.uk|access-date=21 April 2017}}</ref>

They opened a second factory at [[Stonehouse, Gloucestershire]] in the 1930s,<ref>{{Cite web |last=SoGlos |date=24 March 2021 |title=Potential buyers may already have former Spitfire parts factory in Gloucestershire in their sites |url=https://www.soglos.com/news/business/potential-buyers-may-already-have-former-spitfire-parts-factory-in-gloucestershire-in-their-sites/16070/ |access-date=8 March 2023 |website=soglos.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Stroud History Website |url=http://www.stroud-history.org.uk/print.php?type=A&item_id=115 |access-date=8 March 2023 |website=stroud-history.org.uk}}</ref> alongside the [[Stroudwater Navigation]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cotswold Canals in Pictures |url=https://www.cotswoldcanals.net/hoffmans-dam |access-date=8 March 2023 |website=cotswoldcanals.net}}</ref>

The firm became Ransome Hoffmann and Pollard (R.H.P.) after Hoffman's amalgamation with [[Ransome & Marles]] and [[Pollard Ball and Roller Bearing Company]] in 1969.<ref>''The Times'', Tuesday, 14 October 1969; pg. 19; Issue 57690</ref>

The R.H.P. brand, intellectual property rights and company assets were absorbed into the Japanese [[NSK Ltd.]] bearing company in early 1990 trading as NSK-RHP Ltd. at its UK base in Newark on Trent with the historic R.H.P. name finally disappearing in 2001.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

Most of the former Hoffman New Street factory was demolished during the summer of 1990 and the site is now occupied by the sprawling Rivermead Campus of the [[Anglia Ruskin University]].

The only connection to the company name in Chelmsford today is the RHP Bowls club located on part of the old Hoffmans Social Club site at Canterbury Way and Hoffmans Way at the corner of the old factory site at New Street and Rectory Lane.

===English Electric Valve Company===
{{Main|English Electric Valve Company}}
The Waterhouse Lane–based company began in the early 1940s as a part of the [[Marconi Electronic Systems|Marconi]] group, manufacturing magnetrons for defence radar systems. The company was first registered as a separate company in Chelmsford, [[Essex]] in 1947 under Serge Aisenstein.<ref name="firedirect">[http://www.firedirect.net/Profiles/0802_e2v/0802_001.htm Fire Direct company profile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923162457/http://www.firedirect.net/Profiles/0802_e2v/0802_001.htm |date=23 September 2009 }}.

==Transport==
===Railway===
[[File:Chelmsfordstation2008.JPG|thumb|Chelmsford station entrance]]

The [[Eastern Counties Railway]] arrived in Chelmsford in 1842. Owing to the geography of the city, three viaducts were constructed: the longest of which has 18-arches through [[Central Park, Chelmsford|Central Park]]; the station is at the end of the second viaduct; and the third is at the River Chelmer, Springfield. The current  station dates from around 1885.

[[Greater Anglia]] operates all services at [[Chelmsford railway station]]:<ref>{{Cite web |work=Greater Anglia |title=Timetables |date=2 June 2024 |access-date=28 August 2024 |url= https://www.greateranglia.co.uk/timetables |quote=}}</ref>
* Southbound services operate to [[London Liverpool Street]], via {{rws|Shenfield}} and {{rws|Stratford}}
* Northbound services run to [[Colchester railway station|Colchester]], [[Ipswich railway station|Ipswich]], [[Clacton-on-Sea railway station|Clacton-on-Sea]], [[Harwich International railway station|Harwich]], [[Braintree railway station (England)|Braintree]] and [[Norwich railway station|Norwich]], via the [[Great Eastern Main Line]]. 

Around 14,000 commuters each day travel to Liverpool Street by train, making Chelmsford one of the busiest non-terminus stations outside London.

===Buses===
The current bus terminal in Duke Street is the focal point of services in the city. It replaced the ageing 1930s bus station in March 2007 with shops, apartments and a covered roof for passengers.

Routes are operated by the following companies:<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stops in Chelmsford |url=https://www.bustimes.org/localities/chelmsford |website=Bustimes.org |access-date=28 August 2024}}</ref>
* [[First Essex]] is the primary operator, running many routes around the city and beyond including to Basildon, Billericay, Braintree, Colchester, Maldon and Southend. It also operates the [[Essex Airlink|X10/X30 ''Essex Airlink'']] to [[Stansted Airport]]. There are a variety of [[school bus]]es serving the city and surrounding areas.
* [[Arriva Colchester]] operates a single service, the 59 route, to [[Harlow]], via [[Roxwell]], [[The Rodings]], [[Hatfield Heath]] and [[Old Harlow]].
* Other bus companies serve the area including [[Stephensons of Essex]] and [[Hedingham & Chambers]].

Outside of peak times, many of these services are run under contract to [[Essex County Council]].

Essex County Council's Highways and Transportation Department have considered constructing a ''Bus Rapid Transit System'' to be built serving the Beaulieu Park/Springfield Area because of the increasing demand for Rapid Transit Plans in Ipswich, Colchester and Southend.

Chelmsford has a [[park & ride]] service at nearby [[Sandon, Essex|Sandon]], just off junction 18 of the A12; it runs Monday to Saturday, with a capacity of 1,200 cars. Opened in March 2006, it has proved highly successful and is used widely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essexhighways.org/Public-Transport/Park-and-Ride/Chelmsford-Park-and-Ride/Sandon-park-and-ride.aspx |title=Sandon Park and Ride &#124; Essex County Council |access-date=20 April 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019133301/http://www.essexhighways.org/Public-Transport/Park-and-Ride/Chelmsford-Park-and-Ride/Sandon-park-and-ride.aspx |archive-date=19 October 2013}}</ref>

===Road===
{{original research|section|date=January 2012}}
The [[A12 road (England)|A12]] trunk road, which connects [[east London]] and [[Lowestoft]], was originally built by the [[Roman Britain|Romans]] to connect London and [[Colchester]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.essexcc.gov.uk/vip8/ecc/ECCWebsite/dis/cha.jsp?channelOid=114620 |title=Essex County Council |publisher=Government of the United Kingdom |access-date=21 April 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It used to run through the city, until the £34.8m nine-mile (14&nbsp;km) bypass around the east opened in November 1986. Despite being notorious for frequent congestion, poor road surfaces, potholes and accidents, many people move to Chelmsford for it being so well connected by road and rail. 

The [[A414]] trunk road between [[Hemel Hempstead]] and [[Maldon]] is a main road into the city, just off the A12, and links the city to junction 7 of the [M11] motorway in the west, near Harlow. 

The [[A130 road (England)|A130]] provides a link to the [[A127]] and [[A13 road (England)|A13]], while the [[A131 road (England)|A131]] passes through smaller towns and villages. The nearest motorway is the M25 ''London Orbital'' at J11 of the A12, 14 miles away, near Brentwood.

In the south-west of the city centre, the A138 meets the A414 at the Army and Navy roundabout which is notorious for its traffic congestion:
* Traffic lights were tried to improve matters in the early 2000s, but that scheme was abandoned after a short while; however, some of the lights were recommissioned for early morning and evening part-time use in 2009. 
* The recently-built bus lane on the A1114 Great Baddow bypass, and priority to traffic using it, has meant traffic queues approaching the roundabout can now be over {{convert|1|mi|km|abbr=on}} long during peak periods.

Since 2 September 2013, to save money and reduce carbon emissions, many streets lights in the Chelmsford district switched over to Essex County Council's part-night street lighting scheme. This involves most street lights being switched off between 1:00&nbsp;am and 5:00&nbsp;am<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essexchronicle.co.uk/Streetlights-partially-turned-night/story-26221541-detail/story.html|title=Streetlights in Essex to be partially turned back on at night|work=Essex Chronicle|access-date=4 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150731005534/http://www.essexchronicle.co.uk/Streetlights-partially-turned-night/story-26221541-detail/story.html|archive-date=31 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> (Tuesday to Sunday) with exceptions such as the city centre area, key road junctions, some [[pedestrian crossing]]s and known accident sites;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.essexhighways.org/Transport-and-Roads/Roads-and-Pavements/Street-lighting/Part-night-lighting.aspx|title=Part night lighting – Essex County Council|work=essexhighways.org}}</ref> on Monday mornings, the switch off is from midnight to 5:00&nbsp;am.

Chelmsford is 25 to 30 minutes by road from Stansted Airport (via A130/A120); [[Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]], [[Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]], [[London City Airport|London City]], [[Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[Southend Airport|Southend]] airports are all within reach by rail.

===Future transport plans===
[[File:Chelmsford North East Bypass.png|thumb|right|Map of route for the proposed new Chelmsford bypass]]

Proposals for a bypass of Chelmsford connecting the A12 interchange at [[Boreham]] (junction 19) and the [[A131 road (Great Britain)|A131]] were put forward for public consultation by [[Essex County Council]] in 2006; the preferred route was announced in March 2007. It comprises the creation of {{convert|7.9|km|mi|frac=16|abbr=on}} of two-lane dual carriageway and junctions connecting to the A12 and A131, it will sever 10 footpaths/bridleways and involve almost entirely greenfield construction.<ref name="ECC1">{{cite web

==Redevelopment==

A major new development on the Duke Street site of the old 1930s bus station was completed in 2007, which contains a new smaller bus station, shops and luxury apartments. The lower level apartments of this development and the bus station area is known as ''Marconi Plaza'', while the upper level apartments are known as the ''Kings Tower''. The new bus station and shops were opened in January 2007, while the rest of the development was ready in September 2007.

A new housing development site near Beaulieu Park, towards the north of the city, is currently under construction; it will be an urban village containing around 3,500 homes.

The public house ''The Army and Navy'', from which the roundabout gets its name, was demolished in March 2007. It was replaced by a [[Travelodge]] hotel, a ''Frankie & Benny's'' restaurant, a bed store and private apartments. Building work started at the site in October 2007 and the project was completed in December 2008.

Recently, plans were revealed for ''Waterside'', a large development of shops, bars and restaurants on the banks of the [[River Chelmer]] on derelict land near the [[Essex Records Office]], at the end of Wharf Road. If this development goes ahead, High Bridge Road, which connects Parkway and Springfield Road, would be demolished along with the adjacent [[gasometers]] and a new central link road would be built.

The former [[Anglia Ruskin University]] central campus, off Park Road, was demolished in January/February 2010; it has been redeveloped by social housing provider ''Genesis'' as a mixed use development of housing for social rent, alongside other new housing for private sale and several retail units, new squares, streets and plazas. The new development has been given the name ''City Park West''.

High Chelmer shopping centre underwent a refit during 2008/2009 with new flooring, lighting with a new front entrance and a rebounded logo. Further work is being carried out in the shopping centre; an old portion was demolished in spring 2011 and the work was completed in early 2012.

In January 2011, John Lewis announced, together with development partner Aquila House Holdings, that it was to anchor a brand new {{convert|119000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} department store as part of a {{convert|300000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} retail development at Bond Street. The site opened in September 2016.

[[Hylands House]] and Park, just to the west of the city, are a country house and parkland which were saved from dereliction after being purchased by the local council in 1966, after the death of the last private owner, and is now open to the public. Dating from 1730, the house was much damaged by fire and vandalism by the time of the sale, but has since been completely restored by Chelmsford City Council and is now available for weddings and other private hires including conferences. The {{convert|574|acre|ha|abbr=off}} park was landscaped by [[Humphry Repton]] has hosted a wide range of community events, including the annual music festival [[V Festival]]. The 21st [[World Scout Jamboree 2007]] was held at Hylands Park from 27 July to 8 August 2007. Within the grounds which comprise woodland, rolling grassland and lakes is a large children's play area with adjoining car parking.

[[Chelmsford Museum]] in Oaklands Park, off Moulsham Street, is a local history and industrial heritage museum which incorporates the [[Essex Regiment]] Museum. A major £5&nbsp;million extension and redevelopment scheme opened in January 2010 and the museum now includes exhibits and interactive displays focusing on Crompton, Marconi, and Hoffmann, as well as illustrating the development of the town and city from prehistory up to modern times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=18250 |title=New Chelmsford Museum draws in the crowds |website=Chelmsford City Council |access-date=17 September 2010 |archive-date=15 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615105500/http://www.chelmsford.gov.uk/index.cfm?articleid=18250 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Further development in 2019 upgraded the museum to include new visitor facilities as well as new exhibits from the Saxon burial site at Broomfield.

The [[Shire Hall, Chelmsford|Shire Hall]] is situated at the top of the [[High Street]]. Opened in July 1791 and built by local architect and Essex [[county surveyor]] [[John Johnson (architect, born 1732)|John Johnson]], it features a [[Portland stone]] façade. One of the oldest and most prominent buildings in Chelmsford, it was built as a courthouse and there has been a court on the site since at least 1199. However this finally came to an end on 2 April 2012 with the opening of a new magistrates' court a short distance away in New Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/Shire-Hall-shuts-loses-court-role/story-15725118-detail/story.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120913204752/http://www.thisistotalessex.co.uk/Shire-Hall-shuts-loses-court-role/story-15725118-detail/story.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 September 2012 |title=Shire Hall shuts as it loses its court role |website=This is Essex |date=5 April 2012 |access-date=21 April 2012 }}</ref>

[[Chelmsford Cathedral]], which is located directly behind the Shire Hall, is one of the oldest buildings in the city. Originally called "St Mary's Church", it became a cathedral when the [[Diocese of Chelmsford]] for the [[Bishop of Chelmsford]] was created in 1914. It is officially the second smallest in England behind [[Derby Cathedral]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://visitessex.com/chelmsford/thedms.aspx?dms=13&venue=0144881|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011191743/http://visitessex.com/chelmsford/thedms.aspx?dms=13&venue=0144881|url-status=dead|archive-date=11 October 2011|title=Visit Chelmsford for a day out or a short break and discover the delights of the only Essex city.}}</ref>

[[Chelmsford (HM Prison)|Chelmsford Prison]] is a male prison and Young Offenders Institution, constructed in 1830. The 1979 film special of the TV series ''[[Porridge (1974 TV series)|Porridge]]'' with [[Ronnie Barker]] was filmed largely on location at Chelmsford Prison, while it was closed for repairs after a fire.

The 1842 constructed, 18-arch Victorian railway [[viaduct]] (that spans the [[River Can]] in Central Park) is one of three railway viaducts in the city that carry the [[Great Eastern Main Line]]. The viaduct was constructed by the [[Eastern Counties Railway]] and opened for passenger traffic on 29 March 1843.<ref>Essex Chronicle Archive 24 March 1843, Essex Record Office</ref>

Chelmsford's two tallest buildings are:
* Parkside Court, built in 1962 as Melbourne Court in Melbourne Avenue, sometimes locally known as "Melbourne flats", and 
* the 13-floor "Kings Tower" in Duke Street, completed in 2007. 
They share the same height of {{convert|141.04|ft|m}}.

The tallest structure by far in the borough is the former [[Chain Home]] radar tower in [[Great Baddow]] which rises to {{convert|360|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The tower was constructed in 1937 and originally stood at the village of [[Canewdon|Canewdon's]] former [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] base (1936–1970).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rochforddistricthistory.org.uk/page/chain_home_raf_canewdon|title=A history of one of the first radar stations &#124; Chain Home, RAF Canewdon &#124; Canewdon &#124; ... by Places &#124; Rochford District Community Archive|first=Community|last=Sites (www.communitysites.co.uk)|website=rochforddistricthistory.org.uk}}</ref> However, in 1956 it was relocated to [[Great Baddow]].<ref name="historicengland.org.uk">{{Cite web|url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1456445|title=Chain Home tower at Great Baddow, Great Baddow – 1456445 &#124; Historic England|website=historicengland.org.uk}}</ref> It is the only Chain Home tower still in its original unmodified form in the [[United Kingdom]] and is a highly visible landmark throughout the surrounding area.

==Geography and climate==

===Geology===
From over 600,000 years ago, during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]], until the [[Anglian Stage]] around 478,000 to 424,000 years ago, the early [[River Thames]] flowed through the area where Chelmsford now stands, from [[Harlow]] to [[Colchester]], before crossing what is now the [[North Sea]] to become a tributary of the [[Rhine]]. Consequently, gravel deposits are frequently found in the area and current and former [[gravel pit]]s in the district are common.

Chelmsford has two rivers, the [[River Can]] and the [[River Chelmer]]. Although often confused to be the same river in the city centre, they are quite separate until they join towards the east of the city to form the [[Chelmer and Blackwater Navigation]] which heads out towards [[Maldon, Essex|Maldon]] before flowing into [[tide|tidal]] waters at the [[Blackwater Estuary]]. In the other direction, the Chelmer comes from the north from its source near [[Thaxted]] while the Can comes from the West from [[Writtle]] where it separates from the River Wid.

Until the 1960s, these rivers were extremely prone to flooding the city centre area including two disastrous floods in August 1888 (known locally as 'The Great Flood') and in September 1958 (which also badly affected nearby [[Wickford]]) causing widespread damage. Flood prevention schemes in the 1960s on both rivers have largely prevented any further incidents here although the natural floodplains to the north and east such as The 'Baddow Meads' and The 'Chelmer Valley' continue to see flooding after prolonged heavy rainfall.

===Climate===
As with most of the UK, Chelmsford has a [[oceanic climate|temperate oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'' in the [[Köppen climate classification]]), however due to its proximity to continental Europe, Chelmsford enjoys warm summers and cool but not cold winters, with a relatively narrow annual temperature range and few extremes of temperature. Being in the southeast of England, the city enjoys a warmer climate than most of the United Kingdom and is one of the driest areas in the country. The nearest [[met office]] weather station is in [[Writtle]], {{convert|2|mi|km|abbr=off|0}} west of the city centre.

The record highest temperature recorded in Chelmsford was {{convert|39.1|C|F}} on 19 July 2022<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.chelmervillage-weather.co.uk/FreshWDLmaster.html | title=FreshWDL }}</ref> beating the previous record of {{convert|37.7|C|F}} which was set on 25 July 2019.

The coldest temperature recorded in Chelmsford was {{convert|-20.6|C|F}} on 29 January 1947. A low of {{convert|-18.0|C|F}} was recorded during December 1981, and more recently the temperature fell to {{convert|-13.0|C|F}} on 20 December 2010. [[Frost]] is common, occurring on an average of 53 nights of the year.

Rainfall averages 591.8&nbsp;mm a year, with daily totals of over 1&nbsp;mm falling on 108.1 days of the year. Thunderstorms are rare and mostly occur during July and August. All averages refer to the 30-year observation period 1981–2010.

Chelmsford was struck by a F1/F2 [[tornado]] on 23 November 1981 as part of the record-breaking nationwide [[1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak|United Kingdom tornado outbreak]] on that day causing some damage in the city centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi|title=European Severe Weather Database|website=eswd.eu}}</ref>

===Media===

Chelmsford is often referred to as '''the Birthplace of Radio'''.

* '''City Sound Radio''' is a community radio station which started broadcasting online and on digital services in September 2023, delivering local news, topics, popular music, and a haven for unsigned musicians with session and broadcast performance facilities.  It was created to provide more provincial representation at a time where national broadcasters had started to curtail their local obligations. citysound.radio

There are now three Catholic churches within Chelmsford along with a [[Norbertine]] [[canonry]] situated on New London Road; [[St. Philip's Priory]] and one of the largest Catholic private boarding schools in the country, [[New Hall School]].

Other denominations are represented, the [[Baptists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Evangelical Presbyterian Church in England and Wales|Presbyterians]], the [[Britain Yearly Meeting|Quakers]], and the [[United Reformed Church]] all have places of worship within the city.
