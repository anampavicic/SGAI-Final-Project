Before the European conquest the territory was inhabited by the [[Quimbaya]] and Caramanta people. The first conquistadores arrived in the 1537 expedition headed by [[Sebastián de Belalcázar]].

Some Spanish towns were founded, but the decline of the indigenous population and low immigration of Europeans led to Risaralda sitting largely abandoned until the mid-nineteenth century, when coffee cultivation arrived.

During the colonial and early years of the Republic, the region was subject to [[Popayán Province]]. In 1821 it became part of the [[Cauca Department]]. In 1857 it became part of the [[Federal State of Cauca]]. In 1905, Risaralda was attached to the [[Caldas Department]]. In 1966 it was created as a separate department with its capital in [[Pereira, Colombia|Pereira]].
