==Oral history==
[[File:Short oral history of Ilesha in Ijesha language by a native speaker (non-subtitled).webm|thumb|250px|Short oral story of Ilesha in Yoruba language by a native speaker]]

According to the historian  [[Samuel Johnson (Nigerian historian)|Samuel Johnson]]:

{{Cquote|The Olofin-Oduduwa, Yoruba Progenitor [[Ile-Ife]], had several children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren ; amongst them were the king of Ado or [[Benin empire|Benin]], the king of [[Oyo empire|Oyo]], the Osemawe of [[Ondo City|Ondo]] (from a daughter), the Alara of Ara, the Ajero of Ijero, the Alaye of Efon-Alaye, the Owore of Otun, the Orangun of [[Ila, Osun|Ila]], the Aregbajo of Igbajo, and the Owa Ajaka of Ilesa.}} Odo - Ile {Logun Edu} was Oduduwa's Grandchild by Oduduwa's Eldest Daughter (Logun Edu's own son became the First Odole of Ijesaland - {Odole Nikunogbo} [Prime-Minister/Secretary of State of Ijesaland]

{{Cquote|When the Olofin became blind from old age, he was much depressed in mind from this cause ; efforts were put forth to effect his cure, all of which proved fruitless, when a certain man came forward and prescribed for him a sure remedy which among other ingredients contained  [[salt water]]. He put the case before his children, but none made any effort to procure some for him save his youngest grandsons Ajibogun and his Elder brother Agigiri. This was a very brave prince who bore the title of "Esinkin" amongst the King's household warriors, a title much allied to that of the [[Oyo empire#Are Ona Kakanfo|Kakanfo]]. He was surnamed "Ajaka", (i.e. one who fights everywhere, on account of his proclivities and his being fond of adventures). He volunteered to go and fetch some wherever procurable.}}

{{Cquote|Having been away for many years and not heard of, the aged sire and every one else despaired of his ever coming back; so the King divided his property amongst the remaining grown-up children. Although the Alado (king of Benin) was the eldest, the Oloyo was the most beloved, and to him he gave the land, and told him to scour it all over, and settle nowhere till he came to a slippery place, and there make his abode; hence the term "Oyo" (slippery) and thus Oyos are such slippery customers! After they had all gone and settled in their respective localities, all unexpectedly, the young adventurer turned up with water from the sea!}}

{{Cquote|The monarch made use of it as per prescription and regained his sight! Hence, the Ijesas who subsequently became his subjects are sometimes termed "Omo Obokun", children of the brine procurer. Having distributed all his property, he had nothing left for Ajaka. He therefore gave him a sword lying by his side with leave to attack any of his brothers, especially the Alara or Alado, and possess himself of their wealth, but should he fail, to retire back to him; hence the appellation "Owa Ajaka Onida Raharaha" (Owa the ubiquitous fighter, a man with a devastating sword). The Owa Ajaka settled a little way from his grandfather, and on one occasion he paid him a visit, and found him sitting alone with his crown on his head and — out of sheer wantonness — he cut off some of the crown's fringes with his sword. The old man was enraged by this act, and swore that he would never wear a crown with fringes on.}}

{{Cquote|The Aregbajo was one of those who had a crown given to him, but the Owa Ajaka, paying him a visit on one occasion, saw it, and took it away, and never returned it. As a result, the kings of Igbajo never wear a crown to this day. The Owa also attacked the Olojudo and defeated him, and took possession of his crown; but he never put it on. On every public occasion however, it used to be carried before him. This continued to be the case until all the clans became independent.}}

{{Cquote|The Owa's mother, when married as a young bride, was placed under the care of the mother of the Oloyo, hence the [[Alaafin]] of Oyo often regarded the Owa as his own son. The Orangun of Ila and the Alara of Ara were his brothers of the same mother. The [[Ooni of Ife]] was not a son of the Olofin, but the son of a female slave of his whom he offered in sacrifice. The Olofin kept the boy always by him, and when he sent away his sons, this little boy took great care of him and managed his household affairs well until his death. When the Oloyo succeeded his grandfather, he authorised the boy to have charge of the palace and the village, and he sent to notify his brothers of this appointment. So whenever it was asked who was in charge of the house, the answer invariably was "Omo Oluwo ni" (It is the son of the sacrificial victim). This has been contracted to the term Ooni.}}

{{Cquote|The Owa and his brothers used to pay the Alaafin annual visits, with presents of firewood, fine locally-made mats, kola nuts and bitter kolas ; the Owore of Otun with sweet water from a cool spring at Otun — this water the Alaafin first spills on the ground as a [[libation]] before performing any ceremonies. The other Ekiti kings used also to take with them suitable presents as each could afford, and bring away lavish presents from their elder brother. This Ajaka subsequently became the first Owa of the Ijesas.}}
