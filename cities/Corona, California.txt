'''Corona''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Crown") is a city in northwestern [[Riverside County, California]], United States. At the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the city had a population of 157,136, up from 152,374 at the [[2010 United States census|2010 census]]. Corona is surrounded by [[Riverside, California|Riverside]] to the east, [[Norco, California|Norco]] to the north and northeast, [[Yorba Linda, California|Yorba Linda]] to the northwest, [[Cleveland National Forest]] and the [[Santa Ana Mountains]] to the west, southwest, and south. Several unincorporated communities are along the rest of the city's borders. Downtown Corona is approximately {{convert|48|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}} southeast of [[Downtown Los Angeles]] and {{convert|95|mi|km|}} north-northwest of [[San Diego]].

Corona, located along the western edge of [[Southern California]]'s [[Inland Empire]] region, is known as the "Circle City" due to Grand Boulevard's {{convert|3|mi|abbr=on|adj=on}} circular layout. It is one of the most residential cities in the Inland Empire, but also has a large industrial portion on the northern half, being the headquarters of companies such as [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation]], [[Monster Beverage Corporation]], and [[supercar]] manufacturer [[Saleen]].

== Etymology ==
{{See also|List of Riverside County, California, placename etymologies#Corona}}
Corona is Spanish for ''crown'' or ''wreath''. Originally called '''South Riverside''', citizens wanted to distinguish their city from the larger city of Riverside to the north. When it came time to incorporate the city a number of different names were considered, but the name Corona was chosen to play upon a unique feature of the city, the one-mile diameter drive that circled the center of the town.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Corona |url=https://www.coronaca.gov/government/departments-divisions/library-recreation-services/library/heritage-room/history-of-corona |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200524230420/https://www.coronaca.gov/government/departments-divisions/library-recreation-services/library/heritage-room/history-of-corona |archive-date=May 24, 2020 |access-date=May 24, 2020 |website=City of Corona; The Circle City |publisher=City of Corona}}</ref><ref>Gunther, pp 134-135.</ref>

==History==
=== Indigenous ===
[[File:Luiseno adobe 1910.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Tongva]] and [[Payómkawichum]] (pictured in 1910) long inhabited the area that is now Corona.]]
Prior to the late eighteenth century, the area was primarily inhabited by the [[Tongva]] and [[Payómkawichum]], who lived in a series of villages throughout the area. What is now Corona stood at the southeastern extent of [[Tovaangar]], or the Tongva world, and at the northern edge of Payómkawichum territory.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1138875692 |title=East of east : the making of greater El Monte |date=2020 |others=Romeo Guzman, {{proper name|Carri|bean|nohide=y}} Fragoza, Alex Sayf Cummings, Ryan Reft |isbn=978-1-9788-0550-7 |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey |pages=18 |oclc=1138875692}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Greene |first1=Sean |last2=Curwen |first2=Thomas |title=Mapping the Tongva villages of L.A.'s past |url=https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-tongva-map/ |access-date=December 20, 2022 |website=www.latimes.com |date=May 9, 2019 |language=en}}</ref>

The primary settlement in the area was the village of [[Paxauxa]], which was established along the banks of the [[Temescal Creek (Riverside County)|Temescal Creek]] at about where Corona is situated today. The settlement was shared by both the [[Tongva]] and [[Payómkawichum]] people. Cooperation and marriage between the two villages was common.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wkc0AQAAMAAJ |title=Santa Ana River Main Stem and Santiago Creek: Environmental Impact Statement |publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers |year=1978 |pages=122 |chapter=4 Affected Environment}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwi2fcbAPxgC |title=Handbook of North American Indians |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |year=1978 |pages=547}}</ref> High above the city of Corona, the village of [[Pamajam]] was also located in a small valley of the [[Santa Ana Mountains]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qh0QAQAAMAAJ |title=The Masterkey for Indian Lore and History, Volume 30 |publisher=Southwest Museum |year=1956 |pages=46}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |date=1999 |title=Hills for Everyone: Friends of the Wildlife Corridor |url=https://www.hillsforeveryone.org/PDFs/news/hfe-publications/newsletters/1999/fall-1999.pdf |journal=Hills for Everyone |volume=1 |pages=6}}</ref>

=== Colonial period ===

This resulted in villagers being brought to the mission to be baptized and as labor.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wkc0AQAAMAAJ |title=Santa Ana River Main Stem and Santiago Creek: Environmental Impact Statement |date=1978 |language=en}}</ref>

Spanish influence increased in the area with the establishment of the [[San Antonio de Pala Asistencia]] in 1816. Two years following the construction of this mission outpost, the [[Temescal Valley (California)|Temescal Valley]]'s first European resident, Leandro Serrano, was given permission by the Spanish to use the area for [[cattle grazing]]. His first order was to kill the local [[California bear|bear]] and [[mountain lion]] population for the imported herds.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Lech |first=Steve |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/945980945 |title=Pioneers of Riverside County : the Spanish, Mexican and early American periods |date=2012 |isbn=978-1-61423-783-9 |location=Charleston, SC |format=eBook |oclc=945980945}}</ref>

After the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularization of the Spanish missions]] by the [[First Mexican Republic]] in 1833, the land under influence by the missions in [[Alta California]] was gradually granted to large landowners as ranches. In 1848, Californio governor [[Pio Pico]] issued this land to [[Bernardo Yorba]], which included present-day city of Corona.<ref>Ogden Hoffman, 1862, ''Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California'', Numa Hubert, San Francisco</ref><ref name=":1" />

===Establishment===
[[File:ButterfieldstagestationCorona1860.jpg|thumb|right| [[Temescal Butterfield stage station]] Corona in 1860]]Corona was founded at the height of the Southern California [[citrus]] boom in 1886, and is situated at the upper end of the [[Santa Ana River]] Canyon, a significant pass through the [[Santa Ana Mountains]]. The town of Corona was once the "Lemon Capital of the World". A museum there presents the lemon's former role in the local economy. The city's name means crown in Spanish due to the circular shape of a crown and the circular shape of Grand Blvd. The nickname of Corona is "The Circle City" from the unique layout of its streets, with a standard grid enclosed by the circular Grand Boulevard, {{convert|2.75|mi|km}} in circumference.<ref>{{cite news|title=Corona: 'Circle City' to mark centennial of road races|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/corona-675538-race-city.html|newspaper=[[The Press-Enterprise]]|date=August 16, 2013|quote=…Grand Boulevard seems a quaint oddity. A perfect circle, with a circumference just over 2.75 miles, it's the rationale for Corona's tagline as the 'Circle City'.}}</ref> The street layout was designed by Hiram Clay Kellogg, a civil engineer from [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]] who was an influential figure in the early development of Orange County.

Corona was established as a town by the [[South Riverside Land and Water Company]]. The company was incorporated in 1886; founding members included ex-Governor of Iowa [[Samuel Merrill (Iowa governor)|Samuel Merrill]], R.B. Taylor, George L. Joy, A.S. Garretson, and Adolph Rimpau.<ref>[http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c8z3208k/ Finding aid of South Riverside Land and Water Company records, Online Archive of California] from oac.cdlib.org accessed April 26, 2015.</ref> Originally a citrus growers' organization, it purchased the lands of [[Rancho La Sierra (Yorba)|Rancho La Sierra]] of Bernardo Yorba, and the [[Rancho Temescal (Serrano)|Rancho Temescal]] grant and the colony of South Riverside was laid out. They also secured the water rights to [[Temescal Creek (Riverside County)|Temescal Creek]], its tributaries and Lee Lake. Dams and pipelines were built to carry the water to the colony. In 1889, the Temescal Water Company was incorporated, to supply water for the new colony. This company purchased all the water-bearing lands in the Temescal valley and began drilling artesian wells.<ref>Ellerbe, ''History of Temescal Valley'', pp. 18–19</ref>

Originally located in [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]], the city was named "South Riverside" and received its post office in that name on either May 27<ref name=PO>{{cite book |last1=Salley |first1=Harold E. |date=1977 |title= History of California Post Offices, 1849-1976|publisher= The Depot|isbn=0-9601558-1-3}}</ref> or August 11, 1887<ref>Frickstad, Walter N., ''A Century of California Post Offices 1848-1954'', Philatelic Research Society, Oakland, CA. 1955, pp.135-147</ref> with Charles H.

In 1896, the city was renamed "Corona" for its circular Grand Boulevard, where three international automobile races were held in 1913, 1914 and 1916.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoover|first=Mildred B.|author2=Hero Rensch|author3=Ethel Rensch|author4=William N.

The city of Corona has been popular among celebrities drawn to its upscale areas and relative privacy compared to Los Angeles. [[Lucille Ball]] and [[Desi Arnaz]] spent time at their ranch, located in north Corona, and played golf often at the Cresta Verde Golf Course in the northeastern section of the city.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://outsider.com/news/entertainment/i-love-lucy-desi-arnaz-lucille-ball-once-built-home-golf-course-money-won-poker-game/|title='I Love Lucy': Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball Once Built Home on Golf Course with Money He Won in Poker Game|magazine=[[The Outsider (magazine)|The Outsider]]|date=March 2, 2021|author=Joe Rutland}}</ref> After their divorce, Arnaz continued to live in Corona.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.pe.com/2012/03/24/eastvale-a-rebirth-for-the-desi-arnaz-house/|title=EASTVALE: A rebirth for the Desi Arnaz house|newspaper=The Press-Enterprise|date=March 24, 2012|author=Sandra Stokley}}</ref>

===21st century===
In 2002, the city government considered an initiative to secede from Riverside County and form an autonomous Corona County because the city government and some residents were dissatisfied with how services were handled in nearby areas. The effort was also considered by areas in other cities in the western part of the county as far south as [[Murrieta, California|Murrieta]]. Whether nearby cities such as [[Norco, California|Norco]] would have been included in the new county are unknown. The proposed county would have been bordered by [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] to the northwest and by [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] to the west, but it never came to fruition.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.newspress.com/northsouth/greatdivide.html|title=Santa Barbara News Press article on the county split proposal, with a brief mention of the proposed Corona County.}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==

Corona is located in western Riverside County, east of Orange County.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|38.9|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|38.8|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it, or 0.27%, is water.

Corona experiences a warm [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''CSa'') and has mild to cool winters and hot summers. Most of the rainfall (as in all of Southern California) occurs during winter and early spring.

Winter days are pleasant, with the average highs staying in the mid to upper 60s. But compared to other areas in Southern California, winter lows are colder, with common frost and chilly mornings. Snowfall within city limits is rare. Snow flurries will occasionally fall, usually once every other year, but it very rarely snows to the point where it accumulates. The nearby Santa Ana Mountains receive a dusting of snow a few times each winter.

Spring brings pleasant weather with daytime temperatures in the mid to upper 70s, and nighttime lows in the upper 40s. Spring showers are common during the beginning of the season but are a rarity by late May.

Summertime is hot, with highs averaging in the low to mid 90s. During the hottest months, daytime temperatures in Corona can exceed {{convert|100|F|C}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USCA0252?from=36hr_bottomnav_vacation|title=Vacation Planner - Monthly Averages for Corona, CA|website=[[The Weather Company]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023002427/http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/vacationplanner/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USCA0252?from=36hr_bottomnav_vacation|archive-date=October 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/usa/corona/historic|title=Past Weather in Corona, California, USA — Yesterday or Further Back|website=www.timeanddate.com}}</ref> In early summer, Corona receives common overcast weather known as "May Gray" and "[[June Gloom]]". Summer thunderstorms are sporadic and usually happen between July and September from the [[North American Monsoon]]s, bringing increased humidity and scattered thunderstorms.

Autumn features warm days and sharply cooler evenings, but can be windy due to the [[Santa Ana winds]], blowing in two or three times a year from October to December.

==Neighborhoods==

=== Center City ===
==== Downtown District ====
Centered around [[Grand Boulevard (Corona)|Grand Boulevard Historic District]] (GBHD), Downtown District is the oldest area of the city by far, and encompasses portions of the neighborhoods of Civic Center and Circle City along with the entirety of GBHD.

==== North Main Street District ====
The area north of Grand Boulevard Circle centered around N Main St, named North Main Street District, underwent drastic rebranding, redevelopment, and repair beginning in 2017, particularly on the west side of N Main St. Metro at Main - a large mixed-use development featuring apartments atop retail with additional retail along the property - is a commuter community due to its close proximity to [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]]'s [[Corona–North Main station|Corona - North Main Station]], and both SR 91 and I-15 freeways. The east side of N Main St - particularly E Harrison St and E Blaine ST between N Main St and N Joy St - will be converted to a mixed-use community featuring apartments and retail, further making use of the close proximity to Corona - North Main Station.

==== Historic South Main Street Palms District ====
Beginning at the intersection of S Main St and Olive St - one block south of the Grand Boulevard Circle - Historic South Main Street Palms District is a long stretch of varying species of palms that were planted and integrated into the landscaping plan for South Corona in the early 20th century. It includes all of the houses and businesses along S Main St between Olive St and Chase Dr.

=== Unincorporated communities ===
After the boom in housing growth that occurred in Corona in the early 2000s, many previously more isolated communities have come to be completely or mostly surrounded by Corona. They are within the Corona sphere of influence; however, they have not been annexed by the city yet due to unpopular annexation referendums among other reasons. Services are provided by the County of Riverside. These communities are [[Coronita, California|Coronita]], [[El Cerrito, Riverside County, California|El Cerrito]], [[Home Gardens]], and [[Temescal Valley, California|Temescal Valley]], with Temescal Valley having many sub=communities within it such as Arcilla, Glen Eden Sun Club, Glen Ivy, Sycamore Creek, Terramor, and Trilogy. Overall, almost 50,000 people live in these unincorporated communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rctlma.org/Portals/0/genplan/content/ap1/temescalcanyon.html|title=You are being redirected...|website=rctlma.org|access-date=April 21, 2023|archive-date=April 21, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230421191511/https://rctlma.org/Portals/0/genplan/content/ap1/temescalcanyon.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>
