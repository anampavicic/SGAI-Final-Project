[[File:Mughal203.jpg|thumb|left|Procession of Raja Ram Singh II of Kota, Later Mughal Period, c. 1850[[File:Raja_Kotia_Bhil.jpg|thumb|left|king Kotia Bhil Smarak]]]]


The history of the city dates back to the 12th century CE when Rao Deva, a [[Chauhan Dynasty|Chauhan]] Rajput chieftain belonging to the [[Hada (clan)|Hada]] clan conquered the territory and founded [[Bundi]] and [[Hadoti]]. Later, in the early 17th century, during the reign of the Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]], the ruler of Bundi – Rao Ratan Singh, gave the smaller principality of Kota to his son, Madho Singh. Since then Kota became a hallmark of the Rajput gallantry and culture.<ref name="KOTJH" />

Kota became an independent state in 1631 when Rao Madho Singh, the second son of Rao Ratan of [Bundi] was made the ruler, by the Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]].<ref name="HKOT"/> Soon Kota outgrew its parent state to become bigger in area, richer in revenue and more powerful. Maharao Bhim Singh played a pivotal role in Kota's history, having held a 'Mansab'<ref name="HKOT">{{cite web|url=http://www.mapsofindia.com/kota/history.html|title=History of Kota|work=Maps of India|access-date=5 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808092932/http://www.mapsofindia.com/kota/history.html|archive-date=8 August 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> of five thousand and being the first in his dynasty to have the title of [[Maharao]]. Zalim Singh, a diplomat, and statesman, emerged as another prominent figure of the state in the 18th century. Although initially being a general of Kota's army, he rose to the regent of the kingdom after the king died leaving a minor on the throne.<ref name="KOTJH">{{cite web|url=http://www.rajasthantravel.org.uk/kota/|title=About Kota|publisher=Rajasthan Travel|access-date=2016-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908203327/http://www.rajasthantravel.org.uk/kota/|archive-date=8 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> He remained a direct administrator of the state. In 1817, a treaty of friendship was signed between him and the British on his condition of carving out part from the existing state for his descendants resulting in [[Jhalawar State|Jhalawar]] coming into existence in 1838.<ref name="KOTJH"/> Kota was not involved in the earlier events of the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]]. However, when in October 1857 rebels murdered the local British resident and his two sons, British forces responded by storming the city and, after some resistance, capturing it in March 1858.<ref>{{cite book|last=Llewellyn-Jones|first=Rosie|title=The Great Uprising in India, Untold Stories.

In the 1940s, social activist [[Guru Radha Kishan]] organised trade union activities and campaigned against the colonial government. He left Kota after the local administration learned of the arrest warrant issued against him for his participation in Indian Independence activities.

Kota is located along the banks of the [[Chambal River]] in the southern part of [[Rajasthan]]. It is the 3rd largest [[city]] of Rajasthan after [[Jaipur]] and [[Jodhpur]].

The district is bound on the north and north west by [[Sawai Madhopur]], [[Tonk district|Tonk]] and [[Bundi]] districts. The Chambal River separates these districts from Kota district, forming the natural boundary.

The city of Kota is situated at the centre of the southeastern region of Rajasthan a region very widely known as [[Hadoti]], the land of the [[Hada (clan)|Hadas]]. Kota lies along the banks of the Chambal river on a high sloping tableland forming a part of the Malwa Plateau. The general slope of the city is towards the north. The comparatively rocky, barren, and elevated land in the southern part of the city descends towards a plain agricultural land in the north. The Mukundara hills run from southeast to northwest axis of the town.

Kota has fertile land and greenery with irrigation facilities through canals. The two main canals; called as left main canal (towards Bundi) and right main canal (towards Baran) originate from the reservoir created by [[Kota Barrage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kotadivision.nic.in/commandareadevlopment.htm|title=COMMAND AREA DEVELOPMENT CHAMBAL, KOTA|access-date=3 July 2016|publisher=kotadivision.nic.in|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323190452/http://kotadivision.nic.in/commandareadevlopment.htm|archive-date=23 March 2012}}</ref><ref name="CVP">{{cite web|url=http://waterresources.rajasthan.gov.in/4chambal.htm |title=Chambal Valley Project |publisher=Water Resources Department, Govt. of Rajasthan |access-date=3 July 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304085442/http://waterresources.rajasthan.gov.in/4chambal.htm |archive-date= 4 March 2016 }}</ref> The tributaries of these canals make up a network in the city and surrounding areas of Rajasthan and [[Madhya Pradesh]] and supplements the irrigation of these areas.<ref name="CVP"/>

Kota has a semi-arid climate ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSh''), bordering on a [[tropical savanna climate]] (Koppen: Aw), with high temperatures throughout the year. Summers are long, hot, and dry, starting in late March and lasting till the end of June. The temperatures average above 40&nbsp;°C in May and June, frequently exceed 45&nbsp;°C with temperatures as high as 48.5&nbsp;°C also been recorded.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/heat-wave-claims-10-lives-kota-hottest-at-484-c_629219.html|title=Heat wave claims 10 lives; Kota hottest at 48.4&nbsp;°C|date=26 May 2010|access-date=23 April 2016|publisher=Zee News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921131042/http://zeenews.india.com/news/nation/heat-wave-claims-10-lives-kota-hottest-at-484-c_629219.html|archive-date=21 September 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> The monsoon season follows with comparatively lower temperatures, but higher humidity and frequent, torrential downpours. The monsoons subside in October and temperatures rise again. The brief, mild winter starts in late November and lasts until the last week of February. Temperatures hover between 26.7&nbsp;°C (max) to 12.0&nbsp;°C (min). This can be considered the best time to visit Kota because of intense heat in the summer.<ref name="Climate">{{cite web|url=https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,Kota,India|title=Kota Climate details: Monthly Temperature, Rainfall and Sunshine|access-date=2016-05-08|publisher=Weather and climate.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160605055402/https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine,Kota,India|archive-date=5 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

The average annual rainfall in the [[Kota district]] is 800.6&nbsp;mm.<ref name="Statistics by Govt. of Rajasthan"/> Most of the rainfall can be attributed to the southwest [[monsoon]] which has its beginning around the last week of June and may last till mid-September. Pre-monsoon showers begin towards the middle of June with post-monsoon rains occasionally occurring in October. The winter is largely dry, although some rainfall does occur as a result of the [[Western Disturbance]] passing over the region.<ref name="Climate"/>
