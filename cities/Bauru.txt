'''Bauru''' ({{IPA|pt|bawˈɾu}}) is a Brazilian [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in midwestern region of the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].  It is the main city of the [[List of mesoregions of São Paulo (state)|mesoregion]] and [[List of microregions of São Paulo (state)|microregion]] of Bauru. The population is 379,297 (2020 est.) in an area of 667.68&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="ibge">[https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/brasil/sp/bauru/panorama Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística]</ref> Established in 1896, its boundaries are [[Reginópolis]] to the north, [[Arealva]] to the northeast, [[Pederneiras]] to the east, [[Agudos]] and [[Piratininga]] to the south and [[Avaí]] to the west.

The presence of a strong service sector, many college campuses - including the [[University of São Paulo]] and [[Universidade Estadual Paulista]] - and the city's location at the junction of three railroads and three highways make Bauru a major urban center of the State of São Paulo.

It is the hometown of [[Marcos César Pontes]], the first Brazilian in space. It is also the town where [[Pelé]] grew up and learned his football skills.

The city is served by two airports: the older [[Bauru Airport|Comte. João Ribeiro de Barros Airport]] and the newer [[Bauru-Arealva Airport]], officially known as Moussa Nakhl Tobias Airport, located in the adjoining municipality of [[Arealva]].

==Origin of the name==
There are various theories intended to explain the origin of the name Bauru. One was proposed by Ismael Marinho Falcão, an engineer who lived for many years with the [[Kaingang]] tribe, which used to inhabit the region. According to him, the region was called ''ubaurú'' because of the abundance of a herbaceous plant called ''ubá'', used for hampers and wicker baskets, and ''[[Spot-winged Wood Quail|urú]]'', a ground bird related to the chicken.

Others think that the name comes from ''mbai-yuru'', meaning 'waterfall' or 'river in strong declivity';  or ''ybá'' or ''uru'', 'basket of fruits' in [[Old Tupi]];<ref>[http://www.fflch.usp.br/dlcv/tupi/vocabulario.htm University of São Paulo] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120809053512/http://www.fflch.usp.br/dlcv/tupi/vocabulario.htm |date=August 9, 2012 }}, Old Tupi Vocabulary (in Portuguese)</ref> or even ''bauruz'', as the natives who inhabited the edges of the [[Batalha River]] were called.<ref>Busch, Marcela [http://www.mundodigital.unesp.br/webjornal/materia.php?materia=823 UNESP] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426051644/http://www.mundodigital.unesp.br/webjornal/materia.php?materia=823 |date=April 26, 2012 }} ''Exposição "Bauruz" apresenta estilo de vida indígena'', Retrieved 14 December 2011</ref>

==History==
Historically, the region occupied by Bauru was a disputed territory between two Indigenous groups: the Kaingang and the Guaraní. In the eighteenth century, ethnic Brazilian pioneers attempted to settle in São Paulo region, which was a crossing point of the ''monções'' (river expeditions) that went through [[Mato Grosso]] and [[Goiás]], but they were prevented by local natives' attacks.
The non-Indians only managed to settle in the region in the nineteenth century with the coming of the population coming from São Paulo's coast as well the states of [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.camarabauru.sp.gov.br/Municipio/Page.aspx?tipo%3Dhistorico |title=Câmara Municipal de Bauru |access-date=2012-01-06 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112102313/http://www.camarabauru.sp.gov.br/Municipio/Page.aspx?tipo=historico |archive-date=2012-01-12 }}</ref> After 1850, in search of new land for occupation and colonization, pioneers from São Paulo and Minas Gerais began to explore the vast region between the [[Serra de Botucatu]], [[Tietê River]], [[Paranapanema River]] and [[Paraná River]], until then inhabited by Kaingang indigenous groups.

In 1856, Felicissimo Antonio Pereira, coming from Minas Gerais, purchased land and settled, near the current center of Bauru, the Fazenda das Flores (''Farm of Flowers''). Years later, in 1884, this farm (also called Campos Novos de Bauru) have spun off part of its area for the training camp of the São Sebastião de Bauru. The district has progressed, even being subject to attacks of native Kaingang and relatively isolated from the rest of the state and became district of Agudos on 1888. The arrival of migrants from eastern São Paulo and Minas Gerais led to the emancipation of the city on August 1, 1896.

The new municipality at first lived from the cultivation of coffee, despite having weaker and infertile lands than the rest of the state. In 1905, Bauru was chosen as the starting point of the [[Estrada de Ferro Noroeste do Brasil]], which linked by [[Bauru station (NOB)|rail]], Bauru to [[Corumbá]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], near the border with Bolivia.<ref>{{cite book |last=Setti |first=João Bosco |title= Ferrovias no Brasil- um século e meio de evolução Brazilian railroads 150 years of evolution|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=naDdBL0NZSUC|access-date= May 30, 2013|year= 2008|publisher= Sociedade de Pesquisa para Memória do Trem|isbn= 9788586094095|page=111}}</ref> During the first half of the twentieth century, Bauru becomes the main economic hub of the region comprised by west São Paulo, northern Paraná and Mato Grosso do Sul.

== Media ==
In telecommunications, the city was served by [[:pt:Companhia_Telefônica_Brasileira|Companhia Telefônica Brasileira]] until 1973, when it began to be served by [[:pt:Telecomunicações_de_São_Paulo|Telecomunicações de São Paulo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.imprensaoficial.com.br/DO/BuscaDO2001Documento_11_4.aspx?link=/1973/ineditoriais/abril/24/p1/pag_0054_DUI6O3SN7V5CNe7E7ANSRTTG04F.pdf&pagina=54&data=24/04/1973&caderno=Ineditoriais&paginaordenacao=100054|title=Creation of Telesp - April 12, 1973|access-date=2024-05-26|website=www.imprensaoficial.com.br|language=Portuguese}}</ref> In July 1998, this company was acquired by Telefónica, which adopted the [[Vivo (telecommunications company)|Vivo]] brand in 2012.<ref name=":vivo" />
