The name {{lang|ko|釜山}} (now written {{lang|ko|부산}} using the [[hangul|Korean alphabet]]) is [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] for "Cauldron Mountain", believed to be a former name of Mt{{nbsp}}Hwangnyeong ({{Korean|hangul=황령산|hanja=荒嶺山|rr=Hwangnyeongsan}}) west of the city center. The area's ancient state Mt{{nbsp}}Geochil ({{Korean|hangul=거칠산국|hanja=居柒山國|rr=Geochilsan-guk|labels=no}}, "Rough-Mountain Land") is similarly thought to refer to the same mountain, which towers over the town's harbor on the Suyeong. (The later Silla district of Geochilsan-gun was renamed [[Dongnae]] in 757.)<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kookje.co.kr/news2011/asp/newsbody.asp?code=0200&key=20120425.22002211106 |script-title=ko:부산항선 목메어 불러봐도 'Pusan' |website=[[The Kookje Daily News]] |access-date=2019-05-31 |archive-date=2019-05-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190531050034/http://www.kookje.co.kr/news2011/asp/newsbody.asp%3Fcode%3D0200%26key%3D20120425.22002211106 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==History==
The area that Busan now occupies was inhabited during the [[Neolithic]] period. Artifacts dating to this period discovered near the coasts include stone tools, pottery, sea shells, and animal bones. Fishing was a primary food source for people of this period. [[Bronze Age]] artifacts have been uncovered further inland. By this period, agriculture was practiced.<ref name=":0">{{Citation |last=김 |first=기혁 |script-title=ko:부산광역시 (釜山廣域市) |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]] |url=https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0024209 |access-date=2024-06-26 |publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]] |language=ko |archive-date=26 June 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240626013707/https://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Article/E0024209 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Around the first century, a chiefdom called Koch'ilsan-guk ({{Korean|hangul=거칠산국|hanja=居漆山國|labels=no}}) existed around what is now [[Dongnae District]].<ref name=":0" /> At some point, it was absorbed by [[Silla]] and made an administrative division called Koch'ilsan-gun ({{Korean|hangul=거칠산군|hanja=居漆山郡|labels=no}}). In 757, it was renamed Dongnae-gun ({{Korean|hangul=동래군|labels=no}}). In 835, the Buddhist temple [[Beomeosa]] was founded in the area.<ref name=":0" />

In the [[Goryeo]] period (918–1392), the local {{Ill|Dongnae Jeong clan|ko|동래 정씨}} became a prominent presence in Korean politics. By this point, Dongnae's hot springs became famous, and have been attested to in writings of this period.<ref name=":0" /> By the end of the period, raids from ''[[wokou]]'' (Japanese pirates) intensified. One such invasion occurred in 1396. To defend against this, the fortress [[Dongnaeeupseong]] was established in the area.<ref name=":0" />

In 1423, the [[port of Busan]] ({{Korean|hangul=부산포|labels=no}}) and a ''[[Waegwan (enclave)|waegwan]]'' (Japanese concession community) were established.<ref name=":0" /> During the reign of King [[Sejong the Great]] (r. 1418–1450), the population in Dongnae-hyeon was reportedly 2,416 people in 290 households. In Dongpyeong-hyeon, it was 627 people in 108 households. The ''waegwan'' was closed in 1510, but reopened in 1512.<ref name=":0" />

During the 1592–1598 [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions of Korea]], various fortresses in the area defended Busan against the invasion. Fortresses included [[Busanjinseong]], {{Ill|Dadaeposeong|ko|다대포성지}}, and Dongnaeeupseong. Civilians formed [[righteous armies]] (volunteer militias) and joined in the fight.<ref name=":0" /> After the [[Siege of Busanjin|siege and capture of Busanjin]] in 1592, most of Busanjin's Korean prisoners and civilians were massacred.<ref>{{citation|last=Hawley|first=Samuel|year=2005|title=The Imjin War|publisher=The Royal Asiatic Society, Korea Branch/UC Berkeley Press|page=142|isbn=978-89-954424-2-5}}</ref> After the war, diplomatic relations with the new [[shogunate]] in Japan were established in 1607, and Busan was permitted to be reconstructed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}

In 1605, the shrine Songgongsa was built to honor those who died defending Korea during the invasions. The shrine was dubbed [[Chungnyeolsa (Busan)|Chungnyeolsa]] in 1624. In 1607, a ''waegwan'' was reestablished in Dumopo ({{Korean|hangul=두모포|hanja=豆毛浦|labels=no}}); in 1678 it was moved to Choryang ({{Korean|hangul=초량|hanja=草梁|labels=no}}; now around [[Yongdusan Park|Yongdusan]]).<ref name=":0" /> In 1763, Busan became the first place in Korea to have [[sweet potato]]es, which arrived from [[Tsushima Island]] in Japan. In 1759, the population was reportedly 25,753 people in 6,657 households.<ref name=":0" />

In 1876, Busan became the first international port in Korea under the terms of the [[Treaty of Ganghwa]].<ref name=":0" /> In 1877, a concession was established in Busan, and consulates of Japan, [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], and the United Kingdom were established. In 1883, the port was opened, and a [[Busan Customs Office]] ({{Korean|hangul=부산해관|hanja=釜山海關|labels=no}}) was established.<ref name=":0" /> In 1895, Dongnae-bu was made part of [[South Gyeongsang Province]]. It was demoted to a ''gun'' in 1903, and made a ''bu'' again in 1906. After the beginning of the 1910–1945 [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese colonial period]], in 1914 it was made a ''gun'' again. In 1908, Busan was connected to the [[Gyeongbu Line]] via [[Busan station]]. In 1909, a ferry service was opened between Busan and [[Shimonoseki]] in Japan. In 1914, Dongnae-bu was reorganized into Busan-bu. In 1915, a tram was opened between Busanjin and the {{Ill|Dongnae Hot Springs|ko|동래온천}}. The following year, the city tram opened.''<ref name=":0" />''

During the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], Busan developed into a hub trading port with Japan. Busan was the only city in Korea to adopt the steam [[tram]]way before [[electrification]] was introduced in 1924.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dn-SBgAAQBAJ&q=steam+tramway+busan |title=The History of Korean Railway by Photographs |date=19 November 2014 |publisher=길잡이미디어 |isbn=9788955036541 |archive-date=2020-07-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727062731/https://books.google.co.kr/books?id=dn-SBgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=steam+tramway+busan&hl=nl&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwji4pmbmsPbAhXIVbwKHSXXCJEQ6AEIQTAE |url-status=live}}</ref>

During the [[Korean War]], Busan was one of only two cities in South Korea not captured by the [[North Korean army]] within the first three months of the war, the other being [[Daegu]]. As a result, the cities became [[refugee camp]] sites for Koreans during the war. According to ''[[The Korea Times]]'', around 500,000 refugees were located in Busan in early 1951.<ref>{{cite web |first=Andrei |last=Lankov |date=2010-01-31 |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2010/02/113_60003.html |access-date=2015-04-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150607135538/https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/special/2010/02/113_60003.html |archive-date=2015-06-07 |title=January 1951: Life of Korean War Refugees in Busan |work=[[The Korea Times]]}}</ref>

As Busan was one of the few areas in Korea that remained under the control of South Korea throughout the [[Korean War]], for some time it served as a ''de facto''  capital of South Korea.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}} UN troops established a defensive perimeter around the city known as the [[Pusan Perimeter]] in the summer and fall of 1950. Since then, the city has been a self-governing metropolis and has built a strong urban character.

In 1963, Busan separated from [[South Gyeongsang Province]] to become the first {{ill|Directly Governed City|ko|직할시}} of South Korea. In 1983, the provincial capital of Gyeongsangnam-do was moved from Busan to [[Changwon]].{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

==Geography==
Busan is located on the southeastern tip of the [[Korean Peninsula]]. It is located on the coast, which determined the development of the whole city itself. The distance from Busan to [[Seoul]] is about {{cvt|314|km|0}}. Busan borders low mountains on the north and west, and the seas on the south and east. The Nakdong River Delta is located on the west side of the city, and [[Geumjeongsan]], the highest mountain in the city, is on the north. The [[Nakdong River]], South Korea's longest river, flows through the west and empties into the [[Korea Strait]]. The southeastern region, called [[Yeongnam]] in Korea, encompasses both [[Gyeongsang Province]]s and 3 metropolitan cities of Busan, [[Daegu]] and [[Ulsan]]. Ulsan lies northeast of Busan. The combined population exceeds 13 million.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

The closest overseas area to Busan is [[Tsushima Island|Tsushima]], [[Japan]], with a distance of about {{Cvt|49.5|km}}. The closest Japanese mainland area to Busan is [[Fukuoka]], and the distance from Busan to Fukuoka is about 180&nbsp;km (112 miles). Busan and Fukuoka are sister cities.

Located on the southeasternmost tip of the [[Korean Peninsula]], Busan has a cooler version of a [[humid subtropical climate]], bordering on a subtropical monsoon climate influenced by [[East Asian monsoon]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa'', bordering on ''Cwa'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/south-korea/busan |title=Busan Climate |archive-date=2018-09-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180904121034/https://www.climatestotravel.com/climate/south-korea/busan |url-status=live}}</ref> Extremely high or low temperatures are rare.

Late Summer, and early Fall, August, and September, are generally hot and humid and the city may experience [[typhoon]]s at that time and be generally rainy. On September 15, 1959, [[Super Typhoon Sarah (1959)|Super Typhoon Sarah]] passed by the coast of the city and caused catastrophic damage. An unusually severe storm on September 12, 2003, [[Typhoon Maemi]], also caused damage to ships and buildings and resulted in over 48 fatalities. [[Typhoon Hinnamnor]] on September 6, 2022, caused destruction in Busan as a category 2, producing high waves, destructive winds, and flooding. Busan is the most prone city in South Korea to typhoons and other natural disasters.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

October and November are generally the most comfortable, with clear skies and pleasant temperatures. Winters are cool and comparatively dry with high winds, but much milder than other parts of Korea, except [[Jeju Province]] and several islands off the southern coast. Busan and the nearby area have the least snow compared to other regions of Korea due to its location. Snow falls on an average of only about 4 days per year.<ref name= KMA/>

===Administrative divisions===
In 1957, Busan adopted a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|division system]] with the creation of six ''[[Gu (administrative division)|gu]]'' (districts): Busanjin District, Dong  District, Dongnae District, Jung District, Seo District, and Yeongdo District. Today, Busan has divided into fifteen ''gu'' and one ''[[Administrative divisions of South Korea#Gun|gun]]'' (county).

=== Traditional cuisine ===
Busan was once a center of military affairs in the southern region of the peninsula and therefore was an important site for diplomatic relationships with Japan; high-ranking officers and officials from the court frequently visited the city. Special foods were prepared for the officers such as ''Dongnae pajeon'' ({{Korean|hangul=동래파전|labels=no}}), a variant of ''[[pajeon]]'' (Korean savory pancakes), made with whole scallions, sliced chili peppers, and various kinds of seafood in a thick [[Batter (cooking)|batter]] of wheat flour, glutinous rice flour, eggs, salt and water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20090511010021&spage=1 |script-title=ko:[내고장 이 맛!] 부산 동래파전 |publisher=[[Seoul Shinmun]] |access-date=2011-09-15 |archive-date=2011-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929143259/http://www.seoul.co.kr/news/newsView.php?id=20090511010021&spage=1 |url-status=live |date=11 May 2009 }}</ref>

During the Korean War, Busan was the biggest refugee destination on the peninsula; people from all regions of Korea went there. Some of these refugees stayed and adapted and adjusted the recipes of their local specialties. One of these foods is ''[[milmyeon]]'' ({{Korean|밀면|labels=no}}) (lit. 'wheat noodle') a version of ''[[naengmyeon]]'', cold buckwheat noodle soup, but using wheat flour instead. (Naengmyeon is originally a specialty food of [[Hamhung]] and [[Pyongyang]], now part of North Korea.<ref>{{cite web |author=Kim Gi-hyeon (김기현) |date=2009-05-13 |url=http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2009051301031343013002 |script-title=ko:동래파전·돼지국밥…음식도 관광자원으로 |publisher=[[Munhwa Ilbo]] |language=ko |access-date=2009-09-08 |archive-date=2011-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714144417/http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2009051301031343013002 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Lee Gyeong-taek (이경택) |date=2002-09-26 |url=http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2002092601012505011003 |script-title=ko:부산AG 장외 음식열전 |language=Ko |publisher=[[Munhwa Ilbo]] |access-date=2009-09-08 |archive-date=2011-07-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714144543/http://www.munhwa.com/news/view.html?no=2002092601012505011003 |url-status=live}}</ref>) ''[[Dwaeji gukbap]]'' ({{Korean|돼지국밥|labels=no}}) (lit.

Works set in Busan tend to be crime noirs. Additionally, Busan often appears as an escape location or disaster area. Stories where characters escape to Busan to flee accidents or disasters in Seoul and then escape overseas are quite common clichés in Korean disaster films. Train to Busan carries out an escape to Busan, as the title suggests.

Until the late 1990s, most dramas, movies, commercials, and music videos were filmed in the Seoul area, making filming outside Seoul quite rare. In the early 2000s,It was relatively easy to obtain permits for road closures and explosion scenes in Busan that would have been impossible in Seoul. Thanks to active support from the city, word of mouth started in the film industry, leading to a preference for filming in the Busan area.<ref>김필남. (2009).

In particular, the film Haeundae, released on July 22, 2009, was a box office success, achieving 10 million viewers.
