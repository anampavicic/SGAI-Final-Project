The city has a complex recorded history, partially due to the combined regional importance of the usually ice-free [[Port of Klaipėda]] at the mouth of the river {{ill|Akmena-Danė|lt|Akmena (upė)}}.<ref name="KlaipedaVle"/><ref name="KlaipedosUostasVle">{{cite web |last1=Žaromskis |first1=Rimas |title=Klaipėdos jūrų uostas |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/klaipedos-juru-uostas/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=26 March 2023 |language=lt |archive-date=8 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408191127/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/klaipedos-juru-uostas/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Located in [[Lithuania Minor]], it was historically a part of [[Baltic Prussia]], the Prussian [[State of the Teutonic Order]], and later the [[Duchy of Prussia]] under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] until the duchy gained [[Treaty of Wehlau|independence from Poland in 1657]]. As part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] it was the northernmost big city of Germany until the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] when it was placed under French occupation. In 1923, the [[Klaipėda Revolt]] resulted in the city's annexation by Lithuania, which lasted until all of [[Memelland]] rejoined Germany following the [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania]]. After WW2 the USSR annexed both [[Kaliningrad Oblast|North East Prussia]] and Lithuania, and joined Memelland into the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Klaipėda has remained within Lithuania since 1944.

The city continues to experience sustained demographic decline due to flight towards the suburbs and other cities. The number of inhabitants of Klaipėda city shrank from 202,929 in 1989 to 162,360 in 2011,<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=http://db1.stat.gov.lt/statbank/selectvarval/saveselections.asp?MainTable=M3010211&PLanguage=1&TableStyle=&Buttons=&PXSId=3767&IQY=&TC=&ST=ST&rvar0=&rvar1=&rvar2=&rvar3=&rvar4=&rvar5=&rvar6=&rvar7=&rvar8=&rvar9=&rvar10=&rvar11=&rvar12=&rvar13=&rvar14= |title=Total area and population by administrative territory – Database of Indicators – data and statistics |access-date=10 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304045814/http://db1.stat.gov.lt/statbank/selectvarval/saveselections.asp?MainTable=M3010211&PLanguage=1&TableStyle=&Buttons=&PXSId=3767&IQY=&TC=&ST=ST&rvar0=&rvar1=&rvar2=&rvar3=&rvar4=&rvar5=&rvar6=&rvar7=&rvar8=&rvar9=&rvar10=&rvar11=&rvar12=&rvar13=&rvar14= |archive-date=4 March 2016}}</ref> but the [[Urban area#Definitions|urban zone]] of Klaipėda expanded well into the suburbs, which sprang up around the city and surrounded it from three sides.

[[File:Klaipėda seal.png|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Memel city seal, 1446 (diameter {{convert|200|mm|1|abbr=on}}). From the Archive of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation, [[Berlin]].]]
The [[Teutonic Knights]] built a [[Klaipėda Castle|castle]] in the *Pilsāts Land of the [[Curonians]] and named it ''Memelburg'', which would later be shortened to ''Memel''. From 1252 to 1923 and from 1939 to 1945, the town and city were officially named ''Memel''. Between 1923 and 1939, both names were in official use{{Clarification needed|reason=Which names? Memel, Memelburg or Klaipeda?|date=April 2023}}. Since 1945, the Lithuanian name of ''Klaipėda'' has been used.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

The names ''Memelburg'' and ''Memel'' are found in most written sources from the 13th century onwards, while ''Klaipėda'' is found in Lithuanian sources since the 15th century. The city was initially mentioned as ''Caloypede'' in the letter of [[Vytautas]] in 1413,<ref name=":2">{{cite web |url=http://www.mlimuziejus.lt/3/31/312/312.htm |title=Mažosios Lietuvos istorijos muziejus |quote="1413 – pirmąkart paminėtas vardas Klaipėda (Caloypede)" |website=Mlimuziejus.lt |access-date=2 August 2019 |archive-date=9 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070509113156/http://www.mlimuziejus.lt/3/31/312/312.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> and in negotiation documents from 1420, the city was named ''Klawppeda.''<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.klaipedainfo.lt/de/index.php?page=9&sub=3 |title=www.klaipedainfo.lt |access-date=31 May 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311080257/http://klaipedainfo.lt/de/index.php?page=9&sub=3 |archive-date=11 March 2016}}</ref> In the [[Treaty of Melno]] of 1422, the city's name was listed as ''Cleupeda''. According to [[Samogitian language|Samogitian]] [[folk etymology]], the name ''Klaipėda'' refers to the boggy terrain of the town (''klaidyti''=obstruct and ''pėda''=foot). Most likely, the name is of [[Curonian language|Curonian]] origin and means "even ground"; it likely originates from a combination of "klais/klait" (flat, open, free) and "peda" (sole of the foot, ground), as a reference to relatively flat terrain of the original settlement's surroundings. {{Citation needed|date=April 2023}}

The lower reaches of the river [[Neman]] were named either *''Mēmele'' or *''Mēmela'' by [[Scalovians]] and local Curonian inhabitants. In the [[Kursenieki|Latvian Curonian]] language, it means ''mute, silent'' (''memelis, mimelis, mēms''), as a reference to peaceful flow of the Neman. This name was adopted by German speakers, and also was chosen for the new city founded further away at the lagoon.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

The name of the city in the [[Samogitian language]] is spelled slightly differently: {{lang|sgs|Klaipieda}}. The most notable non-Lithuanian names include: {{langx|lv|Klaipēda}}; {{langx|pl|Kłajpeda}}; {{langx|ru|link=no|Клайпеда}}; {{langx|de|link=no|Memel}}.

==Coat of arms==
{{main|Coat of arms of Klaipėda}}

The coat of arms of Klaipėda is also used as the coat of arms of the [[#City municipality|Klaipėda city municipality]]. The modern version was created by the designer [[Kęstutis Mickevičius]]. The modern coat of arms was created by restoring old seals of the Memel city (analogous with those used in the years 1446, 1605 and 1618). It was affirmed on 1 July 1992.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ringis |first1=Dovilė |title=Kas užšifruota Klaipėdos miesto herbe? |url=https://www.atviraklaipeda.lt/2022/11/11/kas-uzsifruota-klaipedos-miesto-herbe/ |website=AtviraKlaipeda.lt |access-date=14 August 2023 |language=lt |date=11 November 2022}}</ref>

==History==

===Teutonic Knights===
A settlement of [[Balts|Baltic tribes]] in the territory of the present-day city is said to have existed in the region as early as the 7th century. The Balts initially established Klaipėda as a trading centre for the storage of goods and annual fairs with the neighbouring Germans.<ref>[[Konstanty Tyszkiewicz|Tyszkiewicz, Konstanty]]. ''[[iarchive:tyszkiewicz-konstanty-wilja-i-jej-brzegi-1871-lt-2013/page/50/mode/2up|Neris ir jos krantai: hidrografiniu, istoriniu, archeologiniu ir etnografiniu požiūriu]]'' [[iarchive:tyszkiewicz-konstanty-wilja-i-jej-brzegi-1871-lt-2013/page/50/mode/2up|[Neris and its shores: from a hydrographic, historical, archaeological and etnographic perspective].]] (in Lithuanian). [[Internet Archive]]. p. 51.</ref>

In the 1240s, [[Pope Gregory IX]] offered King [[Haakon IV of Norway|Håkon IV]] of [[Norway]] the opportunity to conquer the peninsula of [[Sambia]].{{cn|date=September 2024}} However, after Grand Duke [[Mindaugas]] of [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], the [[Teutonic Knights]] and a group of [[crusade]]rs from [[Lübeck]] moved into Sambia and accepted Christianity.{{cn|date=September 2024}} These groups founded a fort in 1252 called ''Memele castrum'' (or ''Memelburg'', "[[Memel Castle]]"). The fort's construction was completed in 1253, and Memel was garrisoned with troops of the [[Teutonic Order]], administered by [[Grand Masters of the Teutonic Knights|Deutschmeister]] [[Eberhard von Seyne]]. Documents for its founding were signed by Eberhard and Bishop Heinrich von Lützelburg of [[Courland]] on 29 July 1252 and 1 August 1252.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

Master [[Conrad von Thierberg]] used the fortress as a base for further campaigns along the river [[Neman]] and against [[Samogitia]]. Memel was unsuccessfully besieged by [[Sambians]] in 1255, and the Sambians surrendered on 1259. Memel was also colonized by settlers from [[Holstein]], Lübeck and [[Dortmund]]. Hence, Memel also being known at the time as ''Neu-Dortmund'', or "New Dortmund". It became the main town of the Diocese of Curonia, with a cathedral and at least two parochial churches, but the development of the castle became the dominant priority. According to different sources, Memel received [[Lübeck city rights]] in 1254<ref>''Klaipėda city information portal''.

In the spring and summer of 1323, a Lithuanian army led by Grand Duke [[Gediminas, Grand Duke of Lithuania|Gediminas]] came up the [[Neman]] and sieged the castle of Memel, while later he marched to other Prussian, Latvian, Estonian territories controlled by the Order, eventually forcing the Order to sue for a truce in October 1323.<ref>{{cite web |title=Gediminas |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/gediminas/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=26 March 2023 |language=lt |archive-date=3 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230203203439/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/gediminas/ |url-status=live}}</ref> While planning a campaign against [[Samogitia]], Memel's garrison of the Teutonic Order's [[Livonia]]n branch was replaced with knights from the [[Prussia]]n branch in 1328.

From 1629 to 1635, the town was occupied by [[Swedish Empire|Sweden]] over several periods during the [[Polish–Swedish War (1626–1629)|Polish-Swedish War of 1626–1629]].<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/>

After the [[Treaty of Königsberg (1656)|Treaty of Königsberg]] in 1656 during the [[Northern Wars]], Elector [[Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]] opened Memel's harbor to Sweden, with whom the harbor's revenue was divided. Sovereignty of the margraves of Brandenburg over the region was affirmed in the [[Treaty of Oliva]] in 1660.

The construction of a fortified defence system around the entire town, initiated in 1627, noticeably changed its status and prospects.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/><ref name="KlaipedaMle"/> In November 1678 a small Swedish army invaded the Prussian territory, but was unable to capture the fortress of Memel.

By the beginning of the 18th century, Memel was one of the strongest fortresses (''Memelfestung'') in Prussia, and the town became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1701. Despite its fortifications, it was captured by Russian troops during the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1757.{{cn|date=September 2024}} Consequently, from 1757 to 1762 the town, along with the rest of eastern Prussia, was dependent on the [[Russian Empire]]. After this war ended, the maintenance of the fortress was neglected, but the town's growth continued.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

Memel became part of the newly formed province of [[East Prussia]] within the Kingdom of Prussia in 1773. In the second half of the 18th century, Memel's lax customs and [[Riga]]'s high duties enticed English traders, who established the first industrial sawmills in the town.{{cn|date=September 2024}} In 1784, 996 ships arrived in Memel, 500 of which were English. The specialisation in wood manufacturing guaranteed Memel's merchants income and stability for more than a hundred years. During this era, it also normalised its trade relations with [[Königsberg]]; regional instability had degraded relations since the 16th century.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

Memel prospered during the second half of the 18th century by exporting timber to [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] for use by the [[Royal Navy]].{{cn|date=September 2024}} In 1792, 756 British ships visited the town to transport lumber from forests near Memel.{{cn|date=September 2024}} In 1800, its imports consisted chiefly of salt, iron and herrings; the exports, which greatly exceeded the imports, were corn, hemp, flax, and, particularly, timber. The 1815 ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' stated that Memel was "provided with the finest harbour in the Baltic".{{cn|date=September 2024}}

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Memel became the temporary capital of the Kingdom of Prussia. Between 1807 and 1808, the town was the residence of King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]], his consort [[Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz|Louise]], his court, and the government.<ref name="fred">{{cite web |title=Karalienės Luizės žingsnius primena medžiai ir pastatai |url=https://kultura.lrytas.lt/istorija/2015/11/27/news/karalienes-luizes-zingsnius-primena-medziai-ir-pastatai-2758138/ |website=[[Lrytas.lt]] |date=27 November 2015 |access-date=27 November 2015 |language=lt-LT |archive-date=30 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171030004139/https://kultura.lrytas.lt/istorija/2015/11/27/news/karalienes-luizes-zingsnius-primena-medziai-ir-pastatai-2758138/ |url-status=live}}</ref> On 9 October 1807 the king signed a document in Memel, later called the [[October Edict]], which abolished [[serfdom]] in Prussia.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Dirsytė |first1=Rima |title=Apie baudžiavos panaikinimą Lietuvoje |url=https://blog.lnb.lt/lituanistika/2021/03/08/apie-baudziavos-panaikinima-lietuvoje/ |website=Martynas Mažvydas National Library of Lithuania |access-date=9 September 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> It originated the reforms of [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl, Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein|Karl Freiherr vom und zum Stein]] and [[Karl August von Hardenberg]].

After the [[unification of Germany]] into the [[German Empire]] in 1871, Memel became Germany's northernmost city.

The development of the town in the 19th century was influenced by the [[Industrial Revolution]] in Prussia, as well as urbanisation.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/> Even though the population of Memel increased fourfold during the 19th century, and had risen to 21,470 by 1910, its pace of development lagged in comparison. The reasons for this were mostly political. Memel was the northernmost and easternmost city in Germany, and although the government was engaged in a very costly tree-planting exercise to stabilise the sand-dunes on the [[Curonian Spit]], most of the financial infusions in the province of [[East Prussia]] were concentrated in Königsberg, the capital of the province. Some notable instances of the German infrastructure investments in the area included sandbar blasting and a new ship canal between [[Baltiysk|Pillau]] and Königsberg, which enabled vessels of up to 6.5 m draughts to moor alongside the city, at a cost of 13 million marks.

Owing to the absence of heavy industry in the 1870s and 1880s, the population of Memel stagnated, although wood manufacturing persisted as the main industry. It remained the central point of the Baltic timber-trade. A British Consul was located in the town in 1800; in 1900 a British Vice-Consul was recorded there, as well as a [[Lloyd's of London|Lloyd's]] Agent.
[[File:Klaipeda Panorama.jpg|thumb|Early 20th-century view of the city featuring the [[Church of St. John, Klaipėda|Church of St. John]]]]

By 1900 steamer services had been established between Memel and [[Zelenogradsk|Cranz]] (on the southern end of the Curonian Spit), and also between Memel and [[Tilsit]]. A main-line railway was built from [[Chernyakhovsk|Insterburg]], the main East Prussian railway junction, to [[St. Petersburg]] via [[Chernyshevskoye|Eydtkuhnen]], the Prussian frontier station. The Memel line also ran from Insterburg via [[Sovetsk, Kaliningrad Oblast|Tilsit]], where a further direct line connected with Königsberg, that crossed the {{convert|4|km|mi|frac=2|adj=mid|-wide|abbr=off}} Memel Valley over three bridges before its arrival in Memel.

During the second half of the 19th century, Memel was a center for the publication of books printed in the [[Lithuanian language]] using a [[Latin-script alphabet]] – these publications were prohibited in the nearby Russian Empire of which Lithuania was a province.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/> The books were then smuggled over the Lithuanian border.

The German 1910 census lists the [[Memel Territory]] population as 149,766, of whom 67,345 declared Lithuanian to be their first language. The Germans greatly predominated in the town and port of Memel as well as in other nearby villages; the Lithuanian population was predominant in the area's rural districts.<ref>''EB'', 1938 Year Book, see [http://gauss.suub.uni-bremen.de/suub/hist/index.jsp?id=Kt.+I-896 map of languages] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201002060127/http://gauss.suub.uni-bremen.de/suub/hist/index.jsp?id=Kt.+I-896 |date=2 October 2020 }}.</ref>

Under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after [[World War I]], Klaipėda and the surrounding [[Klaipėda Region]] (Memel Territory) were detached from Germany and made a [[protectorate]] of the [[Allies of World War I|Entente States]]. The French became provisional administrators of the region until a more permanent solution could be worked out. Both Lithuania and Poland campaigned for their rights in the region. However, it seemed that the region would become a free city, similar to the [[Free City of Danzig]]. Not waiting for an unfavorable decision, the Lithuanians decided to stage the [[Klaipėda Revolt]], take the region by force, and present the Entente with a ''fait accompli''. The revolt was carried out in January 1923 while western Europe was distracted by the [[occupation of the Ruhr]]. The Germans tacitly supported the action, while the French offered only limited resistance.<ref name="Vytautas Kažukauskas">Vytautas Kažukauskas.

The formal [[Klaipėda Convention]] was signed in Paris on 8 May 1924, securing extensive autonomy for the region.<ref>''League of Nations Treaty Series'', vol. 29, pp. 86–115.</ref>

The annexation of the city had significant consequences for the Lithuanian economy and foreign relations. The region subsequently accounted for up to 30% of Lithuania's entire economic production. Between 70% and 80% of foreign trade passed through Klaipėda. The region, which represented only about 5% of Lithuania's territory, contained a third of its industry.<ref>{{cite book |last=Eidintas |first=Alfonsas |author2=Vytautas Žalys |author3=[[Alfred Erich Senn]] |editor=Ed.

[[Weimar Germany]], under Foreign Minister [[Gustav Stresemann]], maintained normal relations with Lithuania. However, [[Nazi Germany]] desired to reacquire the region and tensions rose. Pro-German parties won clear supermajorities in all elections to the [[Klaipėda Parliament]], which often clashed with the Lithuanian-appointed [[Klaipėda Directorate]]. Lithuanian efforts to "re-Lithuanize" [[Prussian Lithuanians]] by promoting the Lithuanian language, culture, education were often met with resistance from the locals. In 1932, a conflict between the Parliament and the Directorate had to be resolved by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. In 1934–1935, the Lithuanians attempted to combat increasing Nazi influence in the region by arresting and prosecuting over 120 Nazi activists for the alleged plot to organize an anti-Lithuanian rebellion.<ref name="Lietuva">Mažoji Lietuva.[http://www.mazoji-lietuva.lt/article.php?article=237 Klaipėdos krašto istorijos vingiuose] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927224535/http://www.mazoji-lietuva.lt/article.php?article=237 |date=27 September 2007 }}.</ref> Despite these rather harsh sentences, the defendants in the [[Neumann–Sass case]] were soon released under pressure from Nazi Germany.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Gliožaitis |first1=Algirdas Antanas |last2=Matulevičius |first2=Algirdas |title=Neumanno-Sasso byla |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/neumanno-sasso-byla/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=26 March 2023 |language=lt |archive-date=1 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230501114614/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/neumanno-sasso-byla/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The extensive autonomy guaranteed by the Klaipėda Convention prevented Lithuania from blocking the growing pro-German attitudes in the region.

As tensions in [[World War II|pre-war]] Europe continued to grow, it was expected that Germany would make a move against Lithuania to reacquire the region. German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania|delivered an ultimatum]] to the Lithuanian Foreign Minister on 20 March 1939, demanding the surrender of Klaipėda. Lithuania, unable to secure international support for its cause, submitted to the ultimatum and, in exchange for the right to use the new harbour facilities as a Free Port, ceded the disputed region to Germany in the late evening of 22 March 1939.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija" /> [[Adolf Hitler]] visited the harbour and delivered a speech to the city residents.

Until the 1970s, Klaipėda was only important to the USSR for its economy, while cultural and religious activity was minimal and restricted. The developers of a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church (Maria, Queen of Peace, constructed 1957–1962) were arrested. The city began to develop cultural activities in the 1970s and 1980s, such as the introduction of the [[Klaipėda Sea Festival|Sea Festival]] cultural tradition, where thousands of people come to celebrate from all over the country. Based on the Pedagogical University of [[Šiauliai]] and the National Conservatory of Lithuania in Klaipėda, the University of Klaipėda was established in 1991. Klaipėda is now the home of a bilingual German-Lithuanian institution, the ''[[Hermann Sudermann|Hermann-Sudermann]]-Schule'', as well as an English-language University, LCC International University.

[[File:Klaipeda castle.jpg|thumb|Residents houses (left) and [[Klaipėda Castle]] (right) in {{Circa|1535}}]]
Klaipėda was established as an outpost dedicated for [[Lithuanian Crusade|German crusaders]].<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/> Initially, Klaipėda developed slowly. In the 13th century, it was often attacked by the [[Sambians]] and [[Samogitians]], and in the middle of the 15th century, it was attacked by the [[Gdańsk]]ians (for trading reasons).<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/> Consequently, in the 13th&ndash;15th centuries, Klaipėda was burned or ruined around 20 times.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/>

In the second half of the 15th century, the residents began to settle in a territory of the Klaipėda Old Town, which was on a peninsula of the right bank of the old {{ill|Danė|lt|Akmena (upė)}}.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/> Soon, the reconstruction of the [[Klaipėda Castle]] began, and all residents moved to the peninsula.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/>

The development of Klaipėda was fueled by the increasing trade of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] with the [[Western world|Western countries]]. Around 1503, there were 25 families of full-fledged townspeople, while in 1540, there were 107 families. Eventually, in 1589, there were 143 families in Klaipėda.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/><ref name="KlaipedaMle"/> The [[Lithuanians]] and [[Curonians]] lived alongside the German [[Ostsiedlung|colonists]], but the [[magistrate]] did not allow non-Germans to join [[Corporation (feudal Europe)|artisan corporations]] and did not grant them rights available to townspeople.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/> In the [[State of the Teutonic Order]], [[Old Prussians]] and Western Lithuanians were not allowed to engage in trade, crafts, and settle in cities. Thus, in the [[Duchy of Prussia]], most of the cities' residents were Germans.<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle">{{cite web |last1=Matulevičius |first1=Algirdas |last2=Kaunas |first2=Domas |title=Mažoji Lietuva |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/mazoji-lietuva/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=8 April 2023 |language=lt |archive-date=3 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230203190510/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/mazoji-lietuva/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Nevertheless, villages in [[Lithuania Minor]] were extensively inhabited by Lithuanians,<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle" /> and Klaipėda developed as one of the most important centres of Lithuania Minor.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija" /> According to the [[Prussia]]n Law, all native citizens were initially called as Prussians, while only in the 16th century classification of the population by nationality began.<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle" /> In 1525–1818, Klaipėda was part of the Lithuanian Province (the term was used in state legal documents and Prussian monarchs decrees), which comprised the most Lithuanian territories of Lithuania Minor (the Klaipėda, [[Tilsit]], [[Ragainė]], [[Įsrūtis]] counties).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matulevičius |first1=Algirdas |title=Lietuvos provincija |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/lietuvos-provincija/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=8 April 2023 |language=lt |archive-date=8 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408185414/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/lietuvos-provincija/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

There were few German colonists in [[Royal Prussia]] when [[List of monarchs of Prussia|Prussian monarchs]] were [[vassal]]s of the [[List of Polish monarchs|Polish kings]] (1466–1660), and they mostly moved to cities and towns.<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle"/> During the [[Second Northern War]] in 1656–1657, Lithuania Minor was damaged by [[Tatars]] detached from the [[Military of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Army of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle"/> Following the [[Treaty of Oliva]] in 1660, Klaipėda become part of the [[Brandenburg-Prussia|Brandenburg-Prussia constituent state]], which led to strengthened oppression of the locals of Lithuania Minor.<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle"/>

[[File:Der Preussische Litthau (1744).jpg|thumb|Prussian Lithuanians in 1744]]
In 1701 the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] was created and Prussian officials and intellectuals propagated a political direction which claimed that a new nation formed from [[Prussian Lithuanians]] (''Lietuvininkai''), Old Prussians, and German colonists.<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle"/> In the beginning of the 18th century 300,000 residents lived in the core of Lithuania Minor and up to 100% of peasant farms in the [[Klaipėda Region]] were Lithuanian, however cities in Lithuania Minor become centres of [[Germanisation]], [[cultural assimilation]], and colonization.<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Matulevičius |first1=Algirdas |title=Prūsijos lietuviai |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/prusijos-lietuviai/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=8 April 2023 |language=lt |archive-date=8 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408185500/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/prusijos-lietuviai/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="LietuvininkaiMle">{{cite web |title=Lietuvininkai |url=https://www.mle.lt/straipsniai/lietuvininkai |website=Mažosios Lietuvos enciklopedija |access-date=10 April 2023 |language=lt |archive-date=8 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230208200703/https://www.mle.lt/straipsniai/lietuvininkai |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1700–1721 the Prussian Lithuanians population was dramatically decreased in Klaipėda and other Lithuanian counties by the [[Great Northern War plague outbreak]] which killed 160,000 (53%) of residents in Lithuania Minor (more than 90% of the deceased were Prussian Lithuanians).<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Gruodytė |first1=Stefanija |last2=Matulevičius |first2=Algirdas |title=Maras Lietuvoje |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/maras-lietuvoje/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=8 April 2023 |language=lt |archive-date=8 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408185541/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/maras-lietuvoje/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Following it, the Prussian authorities organized a large-scale German colonization of Lithuania Minor.<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle"/><ref name="Kolonizacija">{{cite web |last1=Jasas |first1=Rimantas |last2=Kairiūkštytė |first2=Nastazija |last3=Matulevičius |first3=Algirdas |title=Kolonizacija |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/kolonizacija/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=8 April 2023 |language=lt |archive-date=8 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408185733/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/kolonizacija/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The colonists received various privileges, however they constituted for only 13.4% of residents and quite a few of them later departed to other countries.<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle"/><ref name="Kolonizacija"/> In 1736–1818 Klaipėda was part of Lithuanian Department which had over 340,000 residents.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Matulevičius |first1=Algirdas |title=Lietuvos departamentas |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/lietuvos-departamentas/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=8 April 2023 |language=lt |archive-date=8 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230408185907/https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/lietuvos-departamentas/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The recovering population was ravaged by the [[Imperial Russian Army]] during the [[Seven Years' War]] in 1756–1763.<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle"/> In 1782 Klaipėda had 5500 residents, in 1790 – 6300.<ref name="KlaipedaMle"/>

In the [[General State Laws for the Prussian States]] (completed in 1794) the [[serfdom]] and privileged position of landlords and [[Drang nach Osten|colonists]] was consolidated.<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle"/> During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] [[Napoleon I]] occupied most of the Kingdom of Prussia, thus in 1807–1808 Klaipėda was a residence of Prussian monarchs and in 1807 [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] abolished serfdom. Following the abolishment of serfdom Prussian Lithuanians migrated to Klaipėda, especially its outskirts, and in 1837 they constituted 10.1% of the residents. In 1825 Klaipėda had 8,500 residents.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/><ref name="KlaipedaMle"/> Moreover, after the [[January Uprising|Uprising of 1863–1864]] part of the Lithuanian insurgents retreated to Lithuania Minor.<ref name="MazojiLietuvaVle"/> In 1855 {{ill|Vitė|lt|Vitė}} was added to the city of Klaipėda, thus the number of population increased to over 17,000 and in 1875 reached ~20,000. Before [[World War I]], the majority of Lithuanians in [[Königsberg (region)|Königsberg Region]] (which included Klaipėda) integrated into the German nation. In March 1915 the population of Klaipėda was yet again ravaged by the Imperial Russian Army.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/><ref name="KlaipedaMle"/>

Following the [[Klaipėda Revolt]] in 1923, Klaipėda Region was incorporated into [[Lithuania]] and Lithuanian population in Klaipėda increased due to migration (Lithuanians constituted 30.3% and Germans 57.3% of Klaipėda's 35,845 population in 1925).<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/><ref name="Kolonizacija"/><ref name="KlaipedaMle"/> German politicians promoted a Memellander ideology and argued that Germans and local Lithuanians were "two ethnicities (''Volkstümer''), yet one cultural community (''Kulturgemeinschaft'')".<ref name="Safronovas">{{Cite book |last=Safronovas |first=Vasilijus |title=Identities In-Between in East-Central Europe |date=31 March 2021 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780367784393 |editor-last=Fellerer |editor-first=Jan |pages=229–232 |chapter=11: A War Experience in a Bilingual Border Region: The Case of the Memel Territory |access-date=8 April 2023 |editor-last2=Pyrah |editor-first2=Robert |editor-last3=Turda |editor-first3=Marius |chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335255837}}</ref> Lithuania ceded Klaipėda Region to [[Nazi Germany]] due to the [[1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania]], however soon [[World War II]] started and residents of Klaipėda were evacuated to Germany.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/> In the aftermath of World War II almost all the new residents moved to Klaipėda from Lithuania, Russia, [[Belarus]] and [[Ukraine]], replacing the former German-speaking population (after the war only six old residents remained in the city).<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/> Over the years the Lithuanian population in the city continued to grow and constituted: 55.2% in 1959, 60.9% in 1970, 61.5% in 1979, 63.0% in 1989, 71.3% in 2001, 73.9% in 2011.<ref name="KlaipedosIstorija"/>

===Railway===
[[File:Kleinbahn Klaipėda.jpg|thumb|A narrow gauge railway station in 1920]]
The Klaipėda railway station (Lithuanian: Klaipėdos geležinkelio stotis) is located at Priestočio g. 1, north of the Old Town.

The railway station consists of two buildings. The old building, made of yellow bricks and reflecting features of Classical architecture, was built in 1881. Currently, the building hosts various small businesses. The new railway station was built of red bricks in 1983.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

The railway network of then [[Prussia]] reached Klaipėda in 1878. Initially used for lumber and fish freight on the Klaipėda–Šilutė and Klaipėda–Šilutė–Pagėgiai routes, the railway grid network of [[Lithuania Minor]] received a major boost after the [[Klaipėda uprising]] and the annexation of the region by Lithuania in 1923.{{cn|date=September 2024}}

As of 2017, [[Lithuanian Railways]] were operating two routes from Klaipėda railway station. 4 daily trains on route Klaipėda – [[Vilnius]] and 2 daily trains on the Klaipėda–Radviliškis routes. Train tickets could be obtained at the station.<ref>{{Cite web |title=LTG Link {{!}} E. bilietas |url=https://www.traukiniobilietas.lt/portal/ |access-date=2021-11-16|website=www.traukiniobilietas.lt |archive-date=7 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207005822/https://www.traukiniobilietas.lt/portal/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> lt or with a surcharge – on board the trains.

===Trams===
[[Trams in Klaipėda]] functioned in 1904—1934 and 1950–1967. It was the only tram transport in the history of Lithuania, as well as the last years of first independent Lithuania, then in Soviet Lithuania. It was an interurban transport which was operated by Memeler Kleinbahn AG company.

The tram system had two lines with 12&nbsp;km of tracks and 17 tramcars. The first line was from the old city (lighthouse and Strandvilla restaurant) through center and northern suburbs, which included Royal (Didžioji) Vitė and Bomelio Vitė localities. Eventually, the route would go to beaches, then to Melnragė, a resort. The second line was from the old city through Royal Smeltė, an industrial suburb, then south to Wilhelm Channel and Wooden Bay. Line The tram lines were all connected to the stock exchange in the center of the city. Branches of the tram routes connected the center with railway station through Liepaja (now Manto) Street and Liepaja (now Lietuvninku) Square. Another tram route passed near the Winter Port through the Vite locality. In 1950—1967 tram run functioned in line to Smeltė only. Tram lines were used for delivery of goods from railways and ports. Eventually, the tram degraded and closed due to wear, as well as lack of funds for its renewal and development.<ref>''Tatoris Jonas'' Senoji Klaipėda.

==Old town==
[[File:Old town of Klaipeda life.jpg|thumb|right|Old town of Klaipėda]]
Klaipėda's Old Town is notable among other towns in [[Lithuania]] for its abundance of German and Scandinavian architecture. Klaipėda's Old Town is unique with its fachwerk architectural style and its planned street structure, which is uncharacteristic to any other old town in [[Lithuania]]. Its streets are geometrically configured very correctly, and the [[angle]] of intersection is straight.
