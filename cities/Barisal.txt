== History ==
Barisal was part of the ancient kingdoms of [[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]], [[Gangaridai]] and [[Samatata]]. The region was ruled by [[Khadga dynasty|Khadga]], [[Pala Empire|Pala]], [[Chandra dynasty|Chandra]], [[Sena dynasty|Sena]] and [[Deva dynasty]] in the mediaeval period. It was conquered by [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji]] and was later a significant territory of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Bengal Sultanate]]. After the decline of the [[Suri Empire]], the territory became a semi-independent area in the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] period because of heavy fighting between the [[Muslims]] and [[Hindu]] chiefs, although most parts of the city were totally under the control of the governors of the proto-industrialised [[Bengal Subah]]. In course of time, it fell under the [[Nawab of Bengal|Bengal Nawabs]]. Raja Ramranjan Chakravarty was put as a [[de jure]] king during the [[Bengal Presidency]] of the British, later passed to [[East Pakistan]] at independence and finally [[Bangladesh]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.barisaldiv.gov.bd/en/site/page/e31h-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B6%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B2-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%97%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%9F%E0%A6%AD%E0%A7%81%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%BF#:~:text=The%20Barisal%20region%20was%20inhabited,%22Chandrabhadra%22%20lived%20in%20Barisal. |title=Background of Barisal Division |website=barisaldiv.gov.bd}}</ref>

In ancient times, it was called Chandradwip (চন্দ্রদ্বীপ), while during the Medieval Islamic times it was also known as Ismailpur & Bacola (বাকলা) in Europe. [[Ralph Fitch]], the first ever Englishman, a leather merchant, known to have visited Bengal in the mid-1580s, described Barisal in his journal as, "From Chatigan in Bengal, I came to Bacola; the king whereof is a Gentile, a man very well disposed and delighted much to shoot in a gun. His country is very great and fruitful, and hath store of rice, much cotton cloth, and cloth of silk. The houses are very fair and high built, the streets large, and people naked, except a little cloth about their waist. The women wear a great store of silver hoops about their necks and arms, and their legs are ringed with silver and copper, and rings made from elephants' teeth."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ryley |first1=J.

Durga Sagar: with an area of about 2,500 hectare, is the largest pond or dighi of southern Bangladesh. It is located at Madhabpasa village of babuganj upazila, about 11&nbsp;km away from Barisal town. Locally it is known as Madhabpasha Dighi. According to a desire of Rani Durgavati, mother of Raja Joynarayan, the dighi was dug in 1780 (1187 BS). There are coconut trees around the dighi which together with the dighi are bounded by brick-walls. In the middle of the dighi, there is an island with bushes. Migratory birds usually come here during winter. The surrounding areas of the dighi has now been turned into a picnic spot.
Madhabpasha was a capital of the kingdom of [[Chandradvipa]].{{citation needed|date=June 2022}}

Lakhutia: located approximately 8&nbsp;km from Barisal's central business district, the Roy family estate is known as 'Lakhutia' (note: there are several variations of the spelling of this word, including 'Lakutia' and 'Lakhotia'). The Lakhutia zamindar estate was founded by Roop Chandra Roy in the late 17th century. Apart from the main mansion itself, the estate has several Shiva temples and large ponds on the vast property. The Lakhutia mansion – including the Roy family's personal property, was effectively destroyed during the extraordinary violence of the [[1950 East Pakistan riots|1950 East Pakistan Riots]], and then again later during the [[1971 Bangladesh genocide]]. While most of Lakhutia was destroyed during the 1950 and 1971 riots and genocide, the historical site and sparse remains of the mansion remain one of Barisal's main tourist attractions.
