== History ==
Kharagpur received its name from the twelfth king of the [[Mallabhum|Mallabhum dynasty]], [[Kharga Malla]], when he conquered it.<ref>{{Citation|last1=Dasgupta|first2=Samira|last2=Biswas|first3=Rabiranjan|last3=Mallik|first1=Gautam Kumar|title=Heritage Tourism: An Anthropological Journey to Bishnupur|publisher=Mittal|location=New Delhi|isbn=978-8183242943|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0_o9Qj1LOEC&pg=PA18|date=2009|page=32}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Mallik|first1=Abhaya Pada|title=History of Bishnupur-Raj: An Ancient Kingdom of West Bengal|date=1921|publisher=Calcutta|pages=14|edition=the University of Michigan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QF4dAAAAMAAJ|access-date=11 March 2016}}</ref> Kharagpur was a part of the [[Hijli Kingdom]] and ruled by Hindu [[Odia language|Odia]] rulers as a feudatory under [[Gajapati Kingdom|Gajapati Kings]] of [[Odisha]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Bengal, Past & Present |journal=Journal of the Calcutta Historical Society |date=1915 |volume=10 |issue=19–20 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pXK7ZKA3i6YC |publisher=Calcutta Historical Society |language=en}}</ref>{{request quotation|date=September 2023}} Historians claim that in the 16th century, Kharagpur was still a small village surrounded by dense forests. The village was on high rocky barren land. The only inhabited settlement near Kharagpur was [[Hijli]], a small island village on the banks of the [[Rasulpur River]], in the delta of the Bay of Bengal.  It developed into a port town in 1687. Hijli was also a province and it existed until 1886.  It covered parts of Bengal and Orissa. It had important towns like [[Tamluk]], [[Panskura]], and [[Debra, Paschim Medinipur|Debra]], along with the Kelghai and Haldi rivers on the north, south, and east sides bounded by [[Bay of Bengal]] and Kharagpur, [[Keshiary]], [[Dantan]], and [[Jaleswar]] on the west.

Hijli was ruled by [[Taj Khan Karrani|Taj Khan]] who was the disciple of Guru Peer Mackdram Sha Chisti. It was also ruled by the [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]], [[Origin of the Gupta dynasty|Gupta]], and [[Pala Empire|Pal]] dynasties, and by the [[Mughals]]. It is said that Hijli had excellent business and trade centers with judiciary, prison, and administrative offices during the reign of [[Hindu king]]s and during the Mughal Raj. The capital of Hijli was in [[Bahiri]] up to 1628 and was shifted to Hijli afterwards. Hijli Province was at its peak in 1754 and was highly prosperous during this period.

Captain Nicolson was the first English colonialist to invade Hijli and captured the port. In 1687 [[Job Charnock]] with soldiers and warships captured Hijli, defeating Hindu and Mughal defenders. After the war with the Mughals, a treaty was signed between Job Charnock and the Mughal Emperor. The loss suffered by Job Charnock forced him to leave Hijli and to proceed towards [[Uluberia]], while the Mughal Emperor continued to rule the province.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sarkar |first1=Jadu-Nath |last2=Majumdar |first2=Ramesh Chandra |title=The History of Bengal, Etc: Vol. 2.

Hijli as we know it today is only a small part of the Hijli Province, and was created for establishing administrative offices by the British in the 19th century. It is curious that almost the entire Kharagpur division of today has boundaries identical to Hijli Province.

In the 18th century [[Khejuri]], another port town was set up on the banks of the Koukhali River in the delta region. It was established by the British primarily for carrying out trade with European countries. Khejuri was also an island. In the devastating cyclone of 1864, both ports were destroyed. The islands have since merged with the mainland.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Saihgal |first1=Tanya |title=154 years ago, this infamous cyclone in Calcutta took over 60,000 lives and flooded the entire city |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-current-affairs/story/calcutta-cyclone-1864-1356569-2018-10-05 |work=India Today |date=5 October 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

==Transport==
=== Railways  ===
The first railway establishment at Kharagpur started with the commissioning of the rail link between [[Cuttack]] – [[Balasore]] – Kharagpur and from Sini to [[Kolaghat]] via Kharagpur.  Kharagpur as a junction station was established in Railway map in December 1898.<ref name="bnr">{{cite book |last1=Bhowmik |first1=Shyamapada |title=History of the Bengal Nagpur Railway Working Class Movements, 1906-1947: With Special Reference to Kharagpur |date=1998 |publisher=Krantik Prakashani |pages=2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f4vtAAAAMAAJ&q=History+of+the+Bengal+Nagpur+Railway+Working+Class+Movements,+1906-1947:+With+Special+Reference+to+Kharagpur |language=en}}</ref>  The public mood and the reaction of society on introduction of rail transport in this region has been nicely depicted by the famous Bengali Novelist [[Ramapada Chowdhury|Dr Ramapada Chowdhury]] (who was born and raised in Kharagpur) in his novel ''Prothom Prohor.'' (1954) It is said that the people were initially afraid to travel by train for fear of the bridge collapsing, and for fear of getting ''outcaste'' or [[Dalit]] status, since there were no separate seating arrangement for different castes and religions. However, things changed due to famines in the early 20th century. The railway company came forward and offered jobs to the local unemployed men, gave them free rides on trains, and even offered blankets to those travelling by train. This promotional scheme broke the taboos and made rail transport acceptable to this society.

Midnapur's District Headquarters was connected to the bank of the [[Kosai River]] in February 1900. Construction of the bridge over Kosai completed in June 1901. The rail line from [[Howrah]] to Kolaghat up to the Eastern bank and from Kharagpur up to Western bank of [[Rupnarayan River]] was completed in 1899. However, trains between Howrah and Kharagpur were possible only in April 1900 after the bridge over [[Rupnarayan River]] was completed.<ref name=ser>{{cite web|url=http://www.ser.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0,1 |title=Major events in formation of S.E.Railway |publisher=South Eastern Railway |access-date=10 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130401151628/http://www.ser.indianrailways.gov.in/view_section.jsp?lang=0&id=0%2C1 |archive-date=1 April 2013 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

[[Howrah]] – [[Amta]] light Railway (2&nbsp;ft gauge - 610&nbsp;mm) line was completed in 1898 and was operated by M/s Martin & Co. of Calcutta. This link remained operative till 1971. After closure of the light railways, the demand for a broad gauge line between Howrah and Amta gained momentum. The project was completed in four phases. In the first phase, the line between [[Santragachhi|Santragachi]] and [[Domjur]] was completed in 1984.<ref>{{cite book |title=Indian Railways |date=1974 |publisher=Railway Board of India (2006 digital archives) from the [[University of Michigan]] |edition=18-19 vol |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2yGAdvKaJnsC |language=en}}</ref> In the second phase it got extended up to [[Bargachhia|Bargachia]] in 1985, and later up to [[Munsirhat]].<ref name="rp">{{cite book |title=RAILWAY CONVENTION COMMlTEE (1980) - Twelfth Report on Track Expansion Programme of Railways |date=1984 |publisher=Parliament of India |page=125 |url=https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/762515/1/rcc_07_12_1980.pdf}}</ref> Mahendralal Nagar station was completed in 2000, and the final leg to Amta was completed in December 2004.

The need for a rail link between [[Panskura]] and [[Tamluk]] was conceived at the beginning of the 20th century, almost at the same time the rail link between Howrah and Kharagpur was opened. The railway company received offers for construction from two Agencies, M/s Martin & Company and M/s Babu Nibaran Chandra Dutta, the former against a guaranteed return of 3.5% while the latter with none. Although the offer of the latter was lucrative, the dilemma of whether to offer the work of construction to a native or not forced the project to be abandoned. After Independence, the requirement of rail link connecting Panskura and Durgachak came up primarily for the purpose of constructing the [[Haldia Port]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sau |first1=S. N. |title=Economics of Calcutta-Haldia Port Complex |journal=Economic and Political Weekly |date=1990 |volume=25 |issue=18/19 |pages=1015–1026 |jstor=4396260 |issn=0012-9976}}</ref> The rail link between [[Panskura]] – [[Durgachak]] via [[Tamluk]] completed in 1968, which was later extended to [[Haldia]] in 1975. Extension of the rail link to [[Digha]] from Tamluk was sanctioned in 1984;<ref name="rp"/> it took 20 years to complete, set in two phases. The first phase linked Tamluk and [[Contai]] in November 2003, and the tourist destination [[Digha]] was connected to [[Howrah]] in December 2004.<ref>{{cite news |title=Evening train to Digha - Local to run to sea resort six days a week |url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/west-bengal/evening-train-to-digha-local-to-run-to-sea-resort-six-days-a-week/cid/876661 |work=www.telegraphindia.com |publisher=The Telegraph |date=11 June 2005}}</ref>

Geographical location of Kharagpur and its rail links with the rest of the country favored the construction of a centralized workshop with facilities to carry out major repairs of all broad gauge stock. The work was sanctioned in 1900; construction of the workshop was completed in 1904.<ref name="bnr"/>

The need for a centralized Hospital at Khargpur was also felt in the late 19th century. Subsequently, a Hospital with complete medical facilities was established in 1897. Dr [[Arthur Martin-Leake]], [[Victorian Cross]] winner was appointed as Chief Medical Officer of Kharagpur Hospital in 1904.<ref>{{cite web |title=RAMC: Royal Army Medical Corps WW1 |url=http://www.ramc-ww1.com/profile.php?profile_id=11776 |website=www.ramc-ww1.com |publisher=RAMC association}}</ref> However the town still needs good private hospitals and advanced medication and healthcare facilities as in current situation its citizens have to depend on Kolkata for treatment, which is at a distance of 132&nbsp;km.
