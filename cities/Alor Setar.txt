==Etymology==

The city's name was changed to ''Alor Star'' during a 21 December 2003 ceremony proclaiming it a city. The city's previous name was restored on 15 January 2009.<ref name="unrename">{{cite web |last=Majid |first=Embun |date=15 January 2009 |title=Archives &#124; The Star Online |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/1/15/nation/3024815&sec=nation |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417002201/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2009%2F1%2F15%2Fnation%2F3024815&sec=nation |archive-date=17 April 2009 |access-date=27 September 2013 |publisher=Thestar.com.my |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==History==
===Origin===
[[File:Muzium Diraja Kedah (11270861454).jpg|thumb|left|The Kedah Royal Museum. Completed in 1735, it was formerly functioned as the official residence for several sultans of Kedah. The current building is dated from the 19th century.]]
Alor Setar was established on 31 December 1735 by Kedah's 19th Ruler, [[Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II]] and was the state's eighth administrative centre since the establishment of the Kedah Sultanate in 1136.<ref>{{cite web|title=Background of Alor Setar |url=http://www.mbas.gov.my/latarbelakang |work=Alor Setar's Early History |publisher=Alor Setar City Council |access-date=29 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717100534/http://www.mbas.gov.my/latarbelakang |archive-date=17 July 2011 }}</ref> The earlier administrative centres were located in Kota Bukit Meriam, Kota Sungai Emas, Kota Siputeh, Kota Naga, Kota Sena, Kota Indera Kayangan and Kota Bukit Pinang.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cayron|first=Jun G.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ntNp_IeYbQsC&q=The+earlier+administrative+centres+&pg=RA1-PA31|title=Stringing the Past: An Archaeological Understanding of Early Southeast Asian Glass Bead Trade|date=2006|publisher=UP Press|isbn=978-971-542-506-3|language=en}}</ref>

The pre-existing settlement was originally a small village. However, the sultan found the area to be in a strategic location, he was drawn to the area as it was covered in a lush greenery and a center between the two estuaries of [[Kedah River]] converged. Upon the agreement with fellow Kedahan ministers, they agreed to institute a new town known as "Kota Setar" (the "Town of Setar"). The name was derived from [[Bouea macrophylla]], a type of tree that can be found in the area.<ref name="hasrulhassan.com">{{cite web |title= Ketahui Asal-Usul Alor Setar & Sejarah Unik Disebalik Ibu Negeri Tertua di Malaysia|url=https://www.hasrulhassan.com/2020/03/asal-usul-alor-setar-sejarah-unik.html|website= Hasrul Hassan}}</ref>

===Period of turbulence===
A new administration institution was constructed in the settlement, with the sultan resided in Istana Kota Setar. However, the capital suffered a major attack when the [[Bugis]] armanda led by Raja Haji managed to destroy both the Istana Kota Setar (Royal Palace) and Balai Besar (Grand Hall) in 1770. In 1771, the British represented by Francis Light and Sultan Abdullah Mukaram Shah entered an agreement to halt the Bugis influence in Kedah.<ref name="hasrulhassan.com"/>

During the coronation ceremony of [[Ahmad Tajuddin Halim Shah II of Kedah]] on 17 March 1805, Siamese forces managed to [[Siamese invasion of Kedah|occupy the capital]]. The sultan was forced to retreat to Penang and later Malacca. The settlement was put on a standstill for 20 years. He was restored to the crown in 1842 and the capital was temporary relocated to [[Kota Kuala Muda]] before returning to Kota Setar.<ref name="hasrulhassan.com"/>

===Recovery and growth===
[[File:Alor Setar (29100830826).jpg|thumb|left|The Balai Besar of Kedah]]
In October 1883, James F. Agustin, an Englishmen arrived in Kuala Sungai Kedah (now known as [[Kuala Kedah]]) about 10&nbsp;km from the capital. He and a few other English explorers embarked their journey towards inland areas of Kedah where he met several Malay settlement on the riverbanks of the Kedah river.<ref>{{cite web |title= Alor Setar : Ibu Negeri Tertua di Malaysia/The Oldest State Capital|url=https://library.uum.edu.my/blog-post/alor-setar-ibu-negeri-tertua-di-malaysia-the-oldest-state-capital/|website= [[Universiti Utara Malaysia]]}}</ref>

Upon his arrival in Kampung Kota Setar, he befriended several local Malays and they invited him to the sultan's palatial residence. Agustin remarked on the beauty of the palatial architecture and its landscape covered with the stalk trees. He was well received by the sultan and both parties exchanged goods between one another.

The visit by Agustin spurred a growth for a more active and direct [[Trade|trade relations]] between the area and outside commercial powerhouse. The city attracted various cosmopolitan trading activities from the British, Indian, Chinese together with other local and regional merchants. The town prospered from a small settlement into a bustling town designated to accommodate further population growth, commerce and administration. The British especially, was quite drawn to the potential of Kota Setar (as it was then known).

Gradually, Kota Setar thrived and further evolved into a commercial, transportation and communication hub of Kedah. The name was then changed from Kota Setar into Alor Setar, a reflection of its geographical features located in a small stream (known as "Alor" in Malay) which was frequented by the Malay traders from the neighbouring states. However, the name Kota Setar was retained as sub-district under Alor Setar.

===19th and 20th century===
Other significant events during the turn of the 20th century includes the reunification of [[Perlis]] and [[Setul Kingdom|Setul]] (now [[Satun Province|Satun]]) to Kedah by the Siamese in May 1897 (both provinces had been separated from [[Kedah]] in 1821) held in Balai Besar. The event was attended by the Crown Prince of Kedah, Tuanku Abdul Aziz as a representative of Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah. In 1904, the city witnessed the grand wedding of the five children of [[Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah]], lasting for 3 months and the cost estimated to be 3 million Ringgit.<ref>{{Cite web|date=July 31, 2016|first=Laurie|last=Sams|title=Hat Yai, Thailand to Alor Setar, Malaysia|url=http://www.thelongridehome.com.au/hat_yai_thailand_to_alor_setar_malaysia|access-date=2020-12-23|website=The Long Ride Home}}</ref>

On 25 July 1905, the Legislative Council of Kedah (Majlis Mesyuarat Negeri) was formed in Alor Setar, with the Crown Prince, Tuanku Abdul Aziz held as its president. Following the [[Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909]] on 7 July 1909, the transfer of power from the Siamese to British administration was held on 15 July 1909 Balai Besar.<ref name="hasrulhassan.com"/>

Alor Setar fell to the [[Malayan campaign|Japanese occupation]] on 13 December 1945 and was [[Si Rat Malai|annexed to the Siamese]] until 1946. The handover ceremony from Siamese to the British was held in Padang Court, Alor Setar 18 October 1946.<ref name="hasrulhassan.com"/>

The town joined the [[Tunku Abdul Rahman#Protest against Malayan Union|protest against Malayan Union]] during the post-war period. The mass protest was attended by 10,000 against the [[Malayan Union|British backed-proposal]]. It was led by [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]] together with key leaders from [[UMNO]].<ref name="hasrulhassan.com"/> The town also witnessed the 4th [[UMNO]] General Assembly which lay the draft for the foundation of the present-day [[Constitution of Malaysia]].

The coronation ceremony of [[Abdul Halim of Kedah]], the 28th Sultan of Kedah was held in Balai Besar on 20 February 1959. The city celebrates the [[silver jubilee]] of Sultan Abdul Halim in 1983.<ref name="hasrulhassan.com"/>

The change of status of Alor Setar throughout the 20th century was also closely parallel by the rise of its urban development, demographic and population growth. The council was upgraded to Kota Setar Municipal Council on 1 February 1978, which traced its origin to Kota Setar District Council on 1 March 1976, Alor Star Municipal Board in 1958 and Alor Star Sanitary Board in 1905.<ref>{{cite web |title= Sejarah Penubuhan MBAS|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/56918767/SEJARAH-PENUBUHAN-MBAS|website= Scribd}}</ref>

The town celebrated its 250th birthday in 1985.<ref>{{cite web |title= Alor Setar - 250 tahun|url=https://p-library2.s3.filebase.com/singapore-malaysia/Kerajaan%20Negeri%20Kedah%20Darulaman/Alor%20Setar%20250%20Tahun%20%28543%29/Alor%20Setar%20250%20Tahun%20-%20Kerajaan%20Negeri%20Kedah%20Darulaman.pdf|website= Filebase}}</ref> A proposal to upgrade the town into a city status was proposed by the [[Ministry of Housing and Local Government (Malaysia)|Malaysian Ministry of Housing and Local Government]] in 2000.

===21st century===
Alor Setar was proclaimed a city – the ninth in [[Malaysia]] – on 21 December 2003. A ceremony was held at Dataran Tunku, Alor Setar, attended by the Kedah's Sultan [[Tuanku Abdul Halim|Tuanku Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah]], his consort Che' Puan Haminah Hamidun, the heir apparent, other royalty and politicians.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Queen with a common touch|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2012/04/11/queen-with-a-common-touch|access-date=2020-12-23|website=www.thestar.com.my}}</ref>

During the ceremony, the city was formally renamed as "Alor Star", the third time the city has changed its name, from Kota Setar to Alor Setar and Alor Star. On 15 January 2009, the historical spelling "Alor Setar" was returned to be its official designation.
