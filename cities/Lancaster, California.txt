'''Lancaster''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|ŋ|.|k|æ|s|t|ər}} is a [[charter city]] in northern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], in the [[Antelope Valley]] of the western [[Mojave Desert]] in [[Southern California]]. As of the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], the population was 173,516,<ref name=census2020>{{Cite web|title=Gazetteer Files|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|access-date=January 11, 2022|website=Census.gov}}</ref> making Lancaster the [[List of United States cities by population|153rd-most populous city in the United States]] and the [[List of largest cities in California by population|30th most populous]] in [[California]]. Lancaster is a [[twin cities|twin city]] with its southern neighbor [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]]; together, they are the principal cities within the Antelope Valley region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.antelopevalley.com/lancaster.html|title=Lancaster|website=www.antelopevalley.com|access-date=March 7, 2019}}</ref>

Lancaster is located approximately {{convert|70|mi}} north (via [[Interstate 5 in California|I-5]] and [[California State Route 14|SR 14]]) of downtown [[Los Angeles]] and is near the [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] line. It is separated from the [[Los Angeles Basin]] by the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] to the south and from [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] and the [[San Joaquin Valley]] by the [[Tehachapi Mountains]] to the north. The population of Lancaster has grown from 37,000 at the time of its incorporation in 1977 to over 157,000 as of 2019.

==History==
[[File:Moses Langley Wicks Image 796 of An illustrated history of Los Angeles County, California.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Moses Langley Wicks, pioneer developer of Lancaster]]
[[Antelope Valley]], the area where Lancaster is now located, was home to the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] tribe at the time of first contact with Europeans. The Antelope Valley's central geography then served as the hub of a trade route for tribes trading between the California coast, the Central Valley, the Great Basin, and the pueblos of Arizona.<ref>{{Cite web|last=California State Parks|title=Antelope Valley Indian Museum State Historic Park|url=https://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=632|website=California State Parks}}</ref>

After statehood, the Antelope Valley again served as a geographic shortcut but for the [[Stockton–Los Angeles Road|Stockton-Los Angeles Road]] and the [[Butterfield Overland Mail in California|Butterfield Overland Mail]], which had two nearby stops in [[Mud Spring (Antelope Valley)|Mud Spring]] and [[Neenach, California#Cow Springs and French John's Station|Neenach]] in the 1850s. However, Lancaster's origins as a settlement start with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], which replaced the stage coach routes. The railroad built a station house, locomotive watering facility, section gang housing, and railroad track in the location of the town's current center. In 1876 the Southern Pacific completed the line through the Antelope Valley,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/about-us/history-of-lancaster/1876-1910-the-beginning |title=1876-1910: The Beginning - City of Lancaster |website=Cityoflancasterca.org |access-date=March 29, 2018}}</ref> linking [[San Francisco]] and [[Los Angeles]].

Lancaster began as a Scottish settlement.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.cityoflancasterca.org/our-city/about-us/history-demographics/history-of-lancaster | title=History of Lancaster &#124; City of Lancaster }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Lancaster-California | title=Lancaster &#124; Antelope Valley, Mojave Desert, Aerospace &#124; Britannica | date=November 24, 2023 }}</ref> The origin of Lancaster's name is unclear, attributed variously to the surname of a railroad station clerk, the moniker given by railroad officials, or the former Pennsylvania home ([[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]]) of unknown settlers. Train service brought passengers through the water-stop-turned-community, which, with the help of promotional literature, attracted new settlers. The person credited with formally developing the town is Moses Langley Wicks, who in 1884 bought property from the railroad for $2.50 per acre, mapped out a town with streets and lots, and by September was advertising 160-acre tracts of land for $6 an acre. The following year, the Lancaster News started publication, making it the first weekly newspaper in the Antelope Valley. By 1890, Lancaster was bustling and booming, and thanks to adequate rainfall, farmers planted and sold thousands of acres of wheat and barley.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9dUolnkEIeEC|title=Lancaster|isbn=9780738529813 |last1=Gurba |first1=Norma H. |year=2005 |publisher=Arcadia }}</ref>

The town was devastated by the decade-long drought that began in 1894, killing businesses and driving cattle north, though fortunes improved somewhat in the late-1890s following the nearby discoveries of gold and [[borax]]. The Tropico Gold Mine in [[Rosamond, California|Rosamond]] was briefly the largest goldmine in Southern California before its 1956 closure.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Los Angeles Times|date=November 22, 1987|title=Old Gold Mine Abandoned but Not Forgotten|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1987-11-22-mn-23918-story.html|access-date=February 9, 2021|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=SCTV|title=Mojave Desert {{!}} Abandoned Tropico Gold Camp, Rosamond|url=https://scvhistory.com/scvhistory/lw2371c.htm|access-date=February 9, 2021|website=scvhistory.com|publisher=Santa Clarita Valley Public Television}}</ref> The [[Pacific Coast Borax Company]] mine would later become the world's largest borax mine, producing nearly half of the world's supply of borates.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Stringfellow|first=Kim|date=April 2016|title=Borax: The Magic Crystal|url=https://mojaveproject.org/dispatches-item/borax-the-magic-crystal/|access-date=February 9, 2021|website=The Mojave Project}}</ref> The 1912 completion of [[Antelope Valley High School]] allowed students from the growing region to study locally instead of moving to distant cities, hosting the state's first high school dormitory system.<ref>{{Cite web|last=AVHS|title=Antelope Valley High School {{!}} About|url=https://www.antelopevalleyhs.org/about|website=Antelope Valley High School}}</ref>

[[California State Prison, Los Angeles County|Lancaster State Prison]] opened in 1993 and before that Los Angeles County hosted no prisons but accounted for forty percent of California's state-prison inmates.<ref>Wolcott, Denis.

In 2005, Hyundai Motor Co. announced the grand opening of a 4,300-acre, $60 million "Proving Ground," a state-of-the-art testing facility for cars and sports utility vehicles in nearby [[California City, California|California City]].

In 2010, the city opened The BLVD, a one-mile revitalized stretch of Lancaster Boulevard between 10th Street West and Sierra Highway, with additional construction on Elm Avenue and Fig Avenue continuing for the next few months.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/index.aspx?recordid=2087&page=20|title=City of Lancaster's BLVD Transformation Completed|website=cityoflancasterca.org|access-date=March 29, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101214101546/http://cityoflancasterca.org/index.aspx?recordid=2087&page=20|archive-date=December 14, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

City leaders set the goal of becoming the nation's first Net-Zero municipality, wherein the city would produce more clean energy than it consumes. Much of the city's infrastructure including City Hall, local schools, and the minor league baseball stadium are solar-powered. In March 2013, Lancaster became the first city in the USA to require solar panels on all new homes in an effort to make the community more carbon neutral. The rule took effect in January 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/lancaster-to-require-solar-on-every-new-home|title=California City Wants to Require Solar on Every New Home|website=greentechmedia.com|access-date=March 29, 2018}}</ref>

===War Eagle Field / Mira Loma===
[[War Eagle Field]] is a former airfield located in the Mojave Desert, about {{convert|5|mi|abbr=on}} west of central Lancaster.

In 1944, the flight school changed its name to Mira Loma Flight Academy. The airfield inactivated on October 1, 1945, and was declared surplus in 1946. Responsibility for it was given to the [[War Assets Administration]]. The land was then bought by Los Angeles County. The airfield was converted to the Mira Loma Detention Center. In 2012, Los Angeles County closed the detention center.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/opinion/editorials/la-xpm-2012-oct-17-la-ed-miraloma-20121017-story.html|title=The Mira Loma Detention Center mess|date=October 17, 2012|access-date=March 29, 2018|via=LA Times}}</ref> Los Angeles County is currently collaborating with the City of Lancaster, the [[faith-based community]], and the non-profit community to convert the facility into a winter shelter.<ref>{{cite web|title=Winter Shelter Program (Now Closed)|url=http://www.lahsa.org/winter_shelter_program|website=Lahsa.org|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426090533/http://www.lahsa.org/winter_shelter_program|archive-date=April 26, 2015|access-date=March 29, 2018}}</ref>

==Economy==
The Greater Antelope Valley Economic Alliance describes five areas as [[business park|business and industrial parks]] in the city of Lancaster: Fox Field Industrial Corridor (adjacent to the [[General William J. Fox Airfield]]) along Avenue G, North Valley Industrial Center, Lancaster Business Park, Enterprise Business Park, Centerpoint Business Park, and the Southern Amargosa Industrial Area. The former Lancaster Redevelopment Agency is credited with attracting major business operations to the area such as SYGMA, Rite Aide, Micheals, Bank of America, and many more. In 2012 the state of California abolished all local redevelopment agencies. The city's economic development department is now responsible for recruiting large employers and is involved in attracting [[retail]] and dining to Lancaster Town Center, Front Row Center, and other retail centers throughout the city.

Another focus of the Agency and the city was the revitalization of Downtown Lancaster. With historic buildings interspersed with modern amenities such as a library<ref>[http://www.colapublib.org/libs/lancaster/ "Lancaster Library"] ''[[County of Los Angeles Public Library]]'' Official Website</ref> and performing arts center,<ref>[http://www.lpac.org/ "Lancaster Performing Arts Center"] Official Website</ref> downtown businesses formed the Lancaster Old Town Site (LOTS). LOTS has resulted in the renovation of business facades and attraction of new businesses, including [[boutiques]] and restaurants in the Old Town Area.

In 2009, Lancaster had 17% unemployment.<ref name=Deaton2017>{{cite web|url= https://thinkprogress.org/how-a-republican-mayor-turned-his-struggling-california-city-into-a-clean-energy-powerhouse-2bac7dc24bff/ |title=Republican mayor transforms California city into 'the solar capital of the universe'|website=Thinkprogress.org |first=Jeremy |last=Deaton |date=October 13, 2017 |access-date=October 17, 2017}}</ref> Given the strength of China's economy in the face of the global recession, Mayor R. Rex Parris identified recruitment of Chinese manufacturing firms as a high priority in 2009. In early 2010, Mayor Parris led a delegation to explore trade opportunities with China.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/20100907/asian-trips-aim-to-woo-trade-here |title=Asian trips aim to woo trade here |access-date=June 26, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150627043846/http://www.dailybreeze.com/20100907/asian-trips-aim-to-woo-trade-here |archive-date=June 27, 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> An essential component of this trade mission was a stop in [[Shenzhen]], China to meet with representatives of the battery, alternative energy, solar panel, and vehicle manufacturing firm [[BYD Company|BYD]]. BYD was looking to break into the United States vehicle manufacturing market, and was introduced to the City of Lancaster by Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich and his wife, Christine.

Lancaster's partnership with BYD began with the "Home of the Future," in which KB Home utilized BYD's energy efficiency and storage technology to construct some of the first affordable near net-zero homes in the U.S. Through the success of this project, a working relationship was born, which BYD and Lancaster continued to cultivate as [[BYD Auto]] prepared to enter the U.S. market. Once the firm was ready to establish its manufacturing facility, Lancaster was its first stop. In May 2013, [[BYD Auto]] announced two manufacturing facilities to be located in Lancaster. These include a 120,000-square-foot [[BYD electric bus]] manufacturing facility, as well as a separate 44,000-square-foot energy storage system (large scale battery) manufacturing facility.<ref>Li, Shan (May 1, 2013) [https://www.latimes.com/business/la-xpm-2013-may-01-la-fi-mo-china-bus-green-lancaster-20130501-story.html "Chinese carmaker to open first U.S. plant in Lancaster in October"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://gas2.org/2017/10/07/byd-triples-size-california-bus-factory/ |title=BYD Triples Size of California Bus Factory - Gas 2 |access-date=October 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018072144/https://gas2.org/2017/10/07/byd-triples-size-california-bus-factory/ |archive-date=October 18, 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> By April 2019, BYD Lancaster had produced over 300 electric buses for US and Canada.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://insideevs.com/news/343785/byd-produced-its-300th-electric-bus-in-lancaster-california/ |title=BYD Produced Its 300th Electric Bus In Lancaster, California |access-date=July 24, 2019 }}</ref> Lancaster has the highest [[Solar power in California|solar production]] per capita in California.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://icma.org/sites/default/files/307440_Sunshot%20Solar%20Outreach%20Partnership%20Case%20Study_Compilation.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=October 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171018072533/https://icma.org/sites/default/files/307440_Sunshot%20Solar%20Outreach%20Partnership%20Case%20Study_Compilation.pdf#page=12 |archive-date=October 18, 2017 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

===Lancaster Museum of Art and History===
The city has prioritized arts and culture as an economic driver, opening the Lancaster Museum of Art and History, or MOAH, in 2012 locating the new facility in its downtown district known as The BLVD. Originally founded as the Lancaster Museum/Art Gallery in 1986, the MOAH operates four sites within the city, serving the Antelope Valley, Los Angeles County, and parts of Kern and San Bernardino Counties.<ref> {{cite web|url=https://www.cityoflancasterca.org/Home/Components/News/News/2809/1952?arch=1&npage=90|title= City of Lancaster to Host Public Grand Opening of the New Museum of Art and History (MOAH) This Saturday}}</ref> The museum contains over 10,000 art pieces about Southern California.<ref>{{Cite web|title=About|url=https://www.lancastermoah.org/about|access-date=April 13, 2021|website=MOAH|language=en}}</ref>

===The BLVD Cultural District===
In 2018, downtown Lancaster was designated The BLVD Cultural District, one of fourteen California Cultural Districts recognized as a place where culture happens within the state. Within the district, BLVD Cultural District Family Days and the biannual POW! WOW! Antelope Valley mural and arts festival has added nearly 50 murals by both local and internationally known artists to the district. The BLVD project was completed in 2010 and consists of Lancaster Blvd from 10th Street West to Sierra Highway. The multiple festivals have attracted huge crowds in the tens of thousands. The BLVD project was largely accepted as a major success. The [[Western Hotel (Lancaster, California)|Western Hotel]] (1876) is the oldest standing structure in the city of Lancaster, which was converted to a museum under the California Historic Site program in 1992, is also located within The BLVD Cultural District.

The Lancaster Performing Arts Center, in addition to MOAH, is a cultural anchor within the cultural district, providing a varied array of fine arts from [[community theatre]] productions to [[classical music]] and various forms of dance. It also draws celebrity performers from across the country and around the world, including renowned singers, dancers and musicians of all genres as well as comedians and variety shows.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lpac.org/|title=Lancaster Performing Arts Center, Lancaster CA|website=Lpac.org|access-date=March 29, 2018}}</ref>

The BLVD Cultural District is also home to the Lancaster [[Aerospace Walk of Honor]]. Established in 1990 by the Lancaster City Council, the Aerospace Walk of Honor celebrates [[test pilot]]s who were associated with [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. Recognition is awarded for distinguished aviation careers marked by significant and obvious achievements beyond one specific accomplishment. The sidewalk monuments are dedicated to a distinguished group of internationally known experimental test pilots. Five honorees are inducted each year in a special ceremony held in September.

The city has changed from a railroad [[water stop]] of the 19th century to a city with many residents and visitors. Lancaster was the headquarters of the "[[International Flat Earth Research Society|Flat Earth Society]]" from 1974 through 2001.

===The Musical Road===
Lancaster has the first [[musical road]] in the United States. The [[Musical road#Civic Musical Road|Civic Musical Road]] "plays" part of the ''[[William Tell Overture]]'', also known as the theme to the 1950s television show ''[[The Lone Ranger (TV series)|The Lone Ranger]]''. It was first put in by [[Honda]] for a television commercial. After noise and safety complaints, it was paved over two weeks later. After complaints in favor of the road, the musical road was reinstalled in a new location, at 30th Street West and Avenue G, near Fox Airport and Apollo County Park, completed October 17, 2008. While it plays the same song, it is now two miles (3&nbsp;km) away from the nearest residence.<ref>{{cite news| last =Linebaugh| first =Kate| title =Good Vibrations?

===Special events===
Each spring, the California Poppy Festival draws upward of 60,000 guests to Lancaster City Park to celebrate springtime. The [[California Poppy Reserve]], {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of Lancaster, boasts one of California's most abundant crops of the [[California Poppy|state flower]], and the Poppy Festival has become a popular event not only for Lancaster residents, but also for visitors from around the world.  The California Poppy Festival began as an [[Earth Day]] celebration and has grown into an event with over {{convert|55|acre|m2}} of activities and extensive [[wildflower]] information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poppyfestival.com/|title=California Poppy Festival - April 21st & 22nd 2018|website=Poppyfestival.com|access-date=March 29, 2018}}</ref>

"Celebrate Downtown Lancaster", a street fair and farmers' market, is held multiple times throughout the summer and features family-friendly activities, street musicians and a variety of specialty vendors.

In October 2009, the city launched the first annual Streets of Lancaster Grand Prix, a professional go-kart racing event, in downtown Lancaster.  In October 2010, the event was held along the newly revitalized BLVD and expanded to 3 days of festivities, boasting an attendance of 35,000. The event is accompanied by a street festival, live music, and a car show.

In April of each year the "Antelope Valley Gem and Mineral Club" hosts its annual gem and mineral show.  This show usually takes place the last weekend of April at the Lancaster High School grounds.  This event usually draws many visitors and local residents as it is a unique opportunity to see rare rocks, gemstones, specimens and hand made goods such as cabochons, faceted stones and hand made jewelry.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/index.aspx?recordid=1977&page=20 |title=City of Lancaster : City News & Updates |access-date=April 18, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930101545/http://www.cityoflancasterca.org/index.aspx?recordid=1977&page=20 |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>
