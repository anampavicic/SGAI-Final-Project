==Overview==
[[File:Asahi Bridge20220211.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Asahibashi Bridge]]

On August 1, 1922, Asahikawa was founded as Asahikawa ''City''. As the central city in northern Hokkaido, Asahikawa has been influential in industry and commerce. There are about 130 rivers and streams including the [[Ishikari River]] and Chūbetsu River, and over 740 bridges in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/files/keikan/keikan/hakkei/hakkei.htm|script-title=ja:旭川八景|trans-title=Asahikawa 8 Scenes|lang=ja|website=City of Asahikawa|archive-date=2008-05-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080505002057/http://www.city.asahikawa.hokkaido.jp/files/keikan/keikan/hakkei/hakkei.htm|url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Asahibashi]], a bridge over Ishikari River, has been one of the symbols of Asahikawa since its completion in 1932, and it was also registered as one of the Hokkaido Heritage sites on October 22, 2001.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hokkaidoisan.org/heritage/006.html|title=旭橋 &#124; 各地の北海道遺産 &#124; 次の世代に残したい北海道の宝物 北海道遺産|website=www.hokkaidoisan.org}}</ref>

Every winter, the Asahikawa Winter Festival is held on the bank of the Ishikari River, making use of Asahikawa's cold climate and snow. On January 25, 1902, a weather station recorded {{convert|-41|°C|1}}, the lowest temperature in Japanese history.<ref>[http://210.148.92.65/files/sogokeikaku/keikakukossi/sankou.html Asahikawa City 7th General Scheme Gist]{{Dead link|date=May 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} {{in lang|ja}}</ref> Due to its climate and location surrounded by mountains, there are some ski resorts in the outskirts of the city.

The [[Ainu people|Ainu]] called the Asahi River ''Chiu Pet'' meaning "River of Waves", but it was misunderstood as ''Chup Pet'', meaning "Sun River", and so it came to be called Asahi River in Japanese (Asahi meaning "morning sun").
