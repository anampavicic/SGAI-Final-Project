== History ==
Cotia was founded in 1580, and was an active village during the [[Bandeirantes#Bandeiras|"bandeiras" expeditions]]. In 1626, [[Raposo Tavares]] and his companions arrived in the city. The "Sítio do Mandú" and "Sítio do Padre Inácio" (Mandu's Ranch and Priest Inácio's Ranch) were some of the first rural houses to be built there. Nowadays, they are preserved by the "Instituto Brasileiro de Patrimônio Cultural. Cotia was declared an independent municipality on April 2, 1856. According to the 1980 demographic census, the city had a population of over 62 thousand people.

== Geography ==
The city is located west of [[São Paulo]], and has a terrain made of valleys and mountains, reaching a maximum elevation of 1,074 meters above sea level <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.citybrazil.com.br/sp/cotia/geral_detalhe.php?cat=4 |title=Terrain of the city at CityBrazil.com.br |access-date=2009-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305125143/http://citybrazil.com.br/sp/cotia/geral_detalhe.php?cat=4 |archive-date=2016-03-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The city has the [[Cotia River]] as its main river.

The city has a densely populated urban area, but the less developed areas to the west attract  people interested in [[ecotourism]]. The only naturally occurring case of [[Brazilian hemorrhagic fever]] took place here.
