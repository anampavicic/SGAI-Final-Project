'''Manisa''' ({{IPA|tr|maˈnisa}}), historically known as '''Magnesia''', is a city in Turkey's [[Aegean Region]] and the administrative seat of [[Manisa Province]], lying approximately 40&nbsp;km northeast of the major city of [[İzmir]]. The city forms the urban part of the districts [[Şehzadeler]] and [[Yunusemre]], with a population of 385,452 in 2022.<ref name=citypop/>

Modern Manisa is a booming center of industry and services, advantaged by its closeness to the international port city and the regional metropolitan center of [[İzmir]] and by its fertile [[hinterland]] rich in quantity and variety of agricultural production. In fact, İzmir's proximity also adds a particular dimension to all aspects of life's pace in Manisa in the form of a dense traffic of daily commuters between the two cities, separated as they are by a half-hour drive served by a fine six-lane highway nevertheless requiring attention at all times due to its curves and the rapid ascent (sea-level to more than 500 meters at Sabuncubeli Pass) across [[Mount Sipylus]]'s mythic scenery.

The historic part of Manisa spreads out from a forested valley in the immediate slopes of Sipylus mountainside, along Çaybaşı Stream which flows next to [[Niobe]]'s "Weeping Rock" (''"Ağlayan Kaya"''), an ancient bridge called the "Red Bridge" (''"Kırmızı Köprü"'') as well as to several tombs-shrines in the Turkish style dating back to the Saruhan period (14th century). Under Ottoman rule in the centuries that followed, the city had already extended into the undulated terrain at the start of the plain. In the last couple of decades, Manisa's width more than tripled in size across its vast plain formed by the alluvial deposits of the River Gediz, a development in which the construction of new block apartments, [[industrial park|industrial zones]] and of [[Celal Bayar University]] campus played a key role.

The city of Manisa is also widely visited, especially during March and September festivals, the former festival being the continuation of a five-hundred-year-old "Mesir Paste Distribution" tradition, and also for the nearby Mount Spil [[national park]]. It is also a departure point for other visitor attractions of international acclaim which are located nearby within Manisa's depending region, such as [[Sardes]] and [[Alaşehir]] (ancient [[Philadelphia (Lydia)|Philadelphia]]) inland. The city also had a Jewish community.<ref>Avotaynu: the international review of Jewish genealogy, Volume 14, G.

==Name and etymology==
[[File:KybeleManisa.JPG|thumb|[[Hittites|Hittite]]&ndash;[[Luwians|Luwian]] rock carving of Cybele in [[Mount Sipylus]] (13th century BC).]]

Historically, the city was also called ''Magnesia'', and more precisely as [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]], to distinguish it from [[Magnesia on the Maeander]] at a relatively short distance to the south. Traditional view held that the name "Magnesia" derived from the tribe of [[Magnetes]] who would have immigrated here from [[Thessaly]] at the dawn of the region's recorded history.{{cn|date=June 2023}} A connection with native [[Anatolian languages]] has also been suggested, particularly on the basis of discoveries made in the [[Hittites|Hittite]] archives.{{cn|date=June 2023}} The name is rendered as Μαγνησία in ancient and modern [[Greek language]].

The name "Magnesia ad Sipylus" refers to [[Mount Sipylus]] (Mount Spil) that towers over the city and Magnesia became a city of importance starting with the [[Roman Republic|Roman]] dominion, particularly after the 190 BC [[Battle of Magnesia]]. The names "Sipylus" or "Sipylum" in reference to a settlement here are also encountered in some sources, again in reference to the mountain and as abbreviated forms. [[Pliny the Elder]], supported by other sources, mentions that formerly in the same place was a very celebrated city which was called "Tantalis" <ref>{{cite book | title = History of Art In Phrygia, Lydia, Caria And Lycia | page=62 | isbn=978-1-4067-0883-7|author= George Perrot |publisher=Marton Press|year= 2007|language= fr, en}}</ref> or "the city of [[Tantalus]]" whose ruins were still visible around his time.<ref>{{cite book | title = Pausanias, and other Greek sketches, later retitled Pausanias's Description of Greece|  isbn=978-1-4286-4922-4|author= James George Frazer|author-link= James George Frazer|publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing Company]]|orig-date= 1900|year=1965}}</ref>

Under Turkish rule, the name attached to the [[Bey]]s of "[[Sarukhanids|Saruhan]]", who founded the [[Anatolian Turkish Beyliks|Beylik]] which preceded the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the region, has been officially used, along with the name Manisa, for the city and the region alternatively and this until the present period of the [[Republic of Turkey]]. The [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] form of the name "Manisa" (ماغنيسا) was usually as it is still used presently, but a spelling with a longer first syllable, transcribed to modern Turkish as "Mağnisa", was also occasionally encountered. During the first centuries of the Ottoman Empire, many of the sons of [[sultan]]s received their education in Manisa and the city is still commonly known in Turkey as "the city of shahzades" (''Şehzadeler şehri''), a distinctive title it shares only with [[Amasya]] and [[Trabzon]].

The English language [[root word]] ''"[[magnesia (mineral)|magnesia]]"'', from which the words ''"[[magnet]]"'' and ''"[[magnetism]]"'' and numerous other [[derivation (linguistics)|derivations]] were coined, as well as their equivalents in many other languages, may derive from the city's name.

=== Prehistory ===
Traces of [[prehistory]] in the Manisa region, although few in number, nevertheless include two very interesting finds that shed much light on western [[Anatolia]]'s past. The first are the [[fossil]]ized footprints, numbering more than fifty and dated to around 20.000-25.000 BC, discovered in 1969 by [[Maden Tetkik Arama|MTA]], Turkey's state body for [[mineral exploration]], in Sindel village near Manisa's depending district of [[Salihli]] and referred to under that village's name. Some of these footprints are on display today in Manisa Museum while their site of origin of Sindel, where there are also prehistoric paintings, will reportedly become Turkey's first [[geopark]] through a joint project with the [[European Commission]].

===Early Bronze===
The second finds are tombs contemporaneous with [[Troy II]] (3000-2500 BC) and found in the village of [[Yortan]] near [[Kırkağaç]] district center, north of Manisa. Original burial practices observed in these sepulchres led scholars to the definition of a "Yortan culture" in Anatolia's prehistory, many of whose aspects remain yet to be explored.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor = 3642952 | journal=Anatolian Studies | volume=42 |year=1992 |pages=75–78|title = Preliminary survey and core sampling on the Aegean coast of Turkey|author=K. Lambrianides|doi=10.2307/3642952| s2cid=131663490 }}</ref>

=== Luwians, Hittites, Phrygians and Lydians ===
Central and southern parts of western Anatolia entered history with the still obscure [[Luwians|Luwian]] kingdom of [[Arzawa]], probably offshoots, as well as neighbors and, after around 1320 BCE, [[vassal]]s of the [[Hittite Empire]]. [[Cybele]] monument located at Akpınar on the northern flank of Mount Sipylus, at a distance of {{convert|7|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Manisa on the road to [[Turgutlu]] is, along with the [[Kingdom of Mira|King of Mira]] rock relief at [[Mount Nif]] near [[Kemalpaşa]] and a number of [[cuneiform]] tablet records are among the principal evidence of extension of Hittite control and influence in western Anatolia based on local principalities. Cybele monument by itself represents a step of innovation in Hittite art where full-faced figures in high relief are rare. 
The first millennium BC saw the emergence in the region of "[[Phrygians]]" and "[[Maeonians]]", the accounts concerning which are still blended with myths,{{efn |1=While some sources claim that "Meonian" was an earlier name for a "Lydian", another theory holds that Meonians may have preceded Lydians in the region and would have continued their existence as a [[Substrata (linguistics)|substratum]] within the Lydian society, neighboring theirs especially in the mountainous region to the south. While most of what the Lydians could tell about themselves is lost and historians have to rely on secondary sources, a village locally still called "Menye" (''officially Gökçeören'') exists between the district centers of [[Kula, Manisa|Kula]] and Salihli. Ancient traces rich in quantity are visible to the naked eye around the village and preliminary surface explorations have only recently started.}} and finally of [[Lydians]]. Such semi-legendary figures like the local ruler [[Tantalus]], his son [[Pelops]], his daughter [[Niobe]], the departure of a sizable part of the region's population from their shores to found, according to one account, the future [[Etruscan civilization]] in present-day Italy, are all centered around Mount Sipylus, where the first urban settlement was probably located, and date from the period prior to the emergence of the Lydian [[Mermnad dynasty]]. It has also been suggested that the mountain could be the geographical setting for [[Baucis and Philemon]] tale as well, while most sources still usually associate it with [[Tyana]] (Hittite ''Tuwanuwa'') in modern-day [[Kemerhisar]] near [[Niğde]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor = 311324 | journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology | volume=96 | year=1994 | pages=203–223+I–IV|title = A Geographical Setting for the Baucis and Philemon Legend (Ovid Metamorphoses 8.611-724)| author=C.P.Jones| doi=10.2307/311324}}</ref>

In the early 7th century BC, the Lydians under the newly established Mermnad dynasty, with the present-day Manisa region as their heartland expanded their control over a large part of [[Anatolia]], ruling from their capital "[[Sardis|Sfard]]" (''[[Sard]], [[Sardes]], [[Sardis]]'') situated more inland at a distance of {{convert|62|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Manisa. The vestiges from their capital which reached our day bring together remains from several successive civilizations.

=== Hellenistic, Roman and Byzantine periods ===

In [[classical antiquity]], Romans knew the city as [[Magnesia ad Sipylum]]. There, in 190 BC, forces of the [[Roman Republic]] defeated the Seleucid king [[Antiochus the Great]] in the [[Battle of Magnesia]]. Magnesia ad Sipylum became a city of importance under Roman rule, and though nearly destroyed by an earthquake in the reign of [[Tiberius]] (Roman Emperor from 14 AD to 37 AD), was restored by that emperor and flourished through the period of the Roman empire.

In 1076 the [[Byzantine Empire]] lost the city to the [[Seljuks]] in the aftermath of the 1071 [[Battle of Manzikert]].The subsequent [[First Crusade|Crusader]] victory at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1097)]] allowed the Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I]] to recover Magnesia. It was an important regional centre under Byzantine rule, and during the 13th-century interlude of the [[Empire of Nicea]] of 1204 to 1261. Magnesia housed the Imperial mint, the Imperial treasury, and served as the functional capital of the Empire of Nicea until the recovery of [[Constantinople]] in 1261.<ref>

In the early 14th century the region of Magnesia was subject to repeated raids by invading Turkish bands.<ref name=Vryonis/> The local population was unable to repulse the Turkish raids. Thus, after an unsuccessful defence led by the Byzantine Emperor most inhabitants fled to the Aegean coast and the European part of the Byzantine Empire.<ref name=Vryonis/> As a result of the Turkish invasion in the region and the destruction of the city the area was largely abandoned.<ref name=Vryonis/> In 1313, Manisa became a permanent Turkish possession when taken by the [[Anatolian Turkish Beyliks|Beylik]] of [[Sarukhanids|Saruhan]], led by the [[Bey]] of the same name who had started out as a tributary of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuks]] and who reigned until 1346. His sons held the region until 1390, when the first incorporation of their lands into the expanding Ottoman state took place. After a brief interval caused by the Ottoman [[interregnum]] after the [[Battle of Ankara]], Manisa and its surroundings definitely became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1410.

Even during the 15th century Manisa was recorded as being in complete ruins due to the previous Turkish raids.<ref name=Vryonis>{{cite book|author=Speros Vryonis Jr.|title=The decline of medieval Hellenism in Asia Minor and the process of Islamization from the eleventh through the fifteenth century|date=2008|publisher=American Council of Learned Societies|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59740-476-1 |pages=252, 254, 259 |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/39065646/Vryonis-Decline-of-Medieval-Hellinism-in-Asia-Minor}}</ref> As the central town of the Ottoman Empire's Saruhan sanjak, the city became the training ground for shahzades (''[[crown prince]]s''), and it stood out as one of the wealthiest parts of the Empire with many examples of [[Ottoman architecture]] built. In a practice started by [[Murad II]] in 1437, fifteen members of the Ottoman dynasty, including two among the most notable, namely [[Mehmed II]] and [[Süleyman I]], held the administration of the city and of its dependencies in seventeen near-continuous periods until 1595. Although the [[sanjak]] of Saruhan officially depended on the [[eyalet]] of [[Anatolia Province, Ottoman Empire|Anadolu]] with its seat in [[Kütahya]], a large degree of autonomy was left to the princes for them to acquire the experience of government. This practice was discontinued in 1595, largely due to the growing insecurity in the countryside, precursor of [[Jelali Revolts]], and a violent earthquake dealt a severe blow to the Manisa region's prosperity the same year.

Around 1700, Manisa counted about 2,000 taxpayers and 300 pious foundations (''[[vakıf]]'') shops, was renowned for its cotton markets and a type of leather named after the city. Large parts of the population had begun settling and becoming sedentary and the city was a point of terminus for caravans from the east, with İzmir's growth still in its early stages.<ref>{{cite book | title = Bandits and Bureaucrats: the Ottoman route to state centralization | at=p. 243 Appendix I: The Study Area |isbn=0-8014-8419-7|author= Karen Barkey|publisher=[[Cornell University Press]]| year= 1994}}</ref> But already during the preceding century, influent western merchants such as Orlando, often in pact with local warlords such as Cennetoğlu, a brigand (sometimes cited as one of the first in line in western Anatolia's long tradition of [[efe (zeibek)|efe]]s to come) who in the 1620s had assembled a vast company of disbanded Ottoman soldiers and renegades and established control over much of the fertile land around Manisa, had triggered a movement of more commercially sensitive Greek and Jewish populations towards the port city.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Ottoman City Between East and West: Aleppo, İzmir, and Istanbul|chapter=İzmir: From village to colonial port city| page= 91 |isbn=0-521-64304-X |author1=Edhem Eldem |author2=Daniel Goffman |author3=Bruce Alan Masters |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]| year= 1999}}</ref>

Between 1595 and 1836, the sanjak of [[Sarukhanids|Saruhan]] (Manisa) remained attached to the [[Anatolia Province, Ottoman Empire|Eyalet of Anadolu]], as in the time of the Ottoman crown princes. Between 1836 and 1867 the city and its depending region was made part of the short-lived [[Aydın Province, Ottoman Empire|Eyalet of Aydın]], which became a [[vilayet]] with the administrative reforms of 1867. During this phase, Saruhan (Manisa) even had an [[eyalet]] of its own under its name as the "Eyalet of Saruhan" between the even shorter period 1845&ndash;1847. The seat of the province to which Saruhan sanjak depended was the city of [[Aydın]] (1827–1841 and 1843–1846) at first, and was later moved to [[Smyrna]] (1841–1843, 1846–1864).

Manisa was one of the first cities in the Ottoman Empire to benefit from the arrival of a railway line, with the {{convert|93|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} [[Smyrna Cassaba Railway]], whose construction was started from Smyrna in 1863 and which reached its first terminus at Manisa's depending [[Turgutlu|Kasaba]] in 1866. This railway was the third started within the territory of the Ottoman Empire at the time and the first finished within the present-day territory of Turkey.{{efn |1=A short line built in [[Dobruja]] (now in [[Romania]]) was started and finished earlier, and İzmir-[[Aydın]] railway was started earlier in 1856 but finished a year after Smyrna Cassaba Railway in 1867.}} Instead of being laid along the direct route eastwards from Smyrna to Kasaba, about fifty kilometers in length, the line built drew a wide arc advancing first to the north-west from İzmir, through its [[Karşıyaka]] suburb to whose foundation it contributed greatly, and curves eastwards only from [[Menemen]] on, crossing the former [[sanjak]] and the present-day province center of Manisa to join Kasaba (now [[Turgutlu]]) from the north. The first concession under the name was granted to a locally based English entrepreneur named [[Edward Price (entrepreneur)|Edward Price]], who founded the company and built the line. This railway was extended further east by the same company between 1872 and 1875 to reach Alaşehir at a distance of {{convert|76|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} from Kasaba and a connection northwards starting from Manisa itself was built between 1888 and 1890 to reach the [[lignite]]-rich [[Soma, Manisa|Soma]], another dependency of Manisa, through a {{convert|92|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} line. Price sold the whole network in 1893 to the Franco-Belgian group [[Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits]], which extended it further east to Afyonkarahisar in 1896 and further north to Bandırma in 1912.<ref>{{cite book |title= Across the Borders: Financing the World's Railways in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries| page= 188| isbn=978-0-7546-6029-3 |editor= Ralf Roth |editor2=Günter Dinhobl | publisher= [[Ashgate Publishing]]|year= 2008}}</ref> The line was [[nationalization|nationalized]] in 1934 by the young Republic of Turkey in the frame of a general move started in the 1920s regarding Turkey's railways.

Manisa was rebuilt and became the centre of Saruhan Province in 1923 under the new [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]. The province's name was changed to Manisa, as was the city itself, in 1927.

== Climate ==
Manisa has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Csa'', [[Trewartha climate classification]]: ''Cs'') with hot, dry summers and short, cool but wet winters. Summers in Manisa are hotter than its western neighbour [[İzmir]], while winters are colder due to its inland location. Snowfall, while fairly uncommon, does accumulate most winters, with a record snow depth of 44&nbsp;cm in January 1945.

Records began in 1930. The record high temperature was {{Convert|45.5|C|F|abbr=on}} in 25 July 2007, while the record low temperature was {{Convert|-17.5|C|F|abbr=on}} in 4 January 1942.

==Cuisine==
The cuisine of Manisa is known for several types of [[kebab]]s. Manisa [[Kebab]] is a type of [[shish kebab]] prepared with a combination of minced beef and lamb. It is served on chopped up [[pita]] and with grilled tomato and peppers, and onion salad. Lastly, melted butter and [[sumac]] is added on top. It may also be served with [[yogurt]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Asırlık lezzet Manisa kebabı |url=https://www.ntv.com.tr/galeri/yasam/asirlik-lezzet-manisa-kebabi,vxLwcNM_4UCCNfgwdhM_cw/0XZFGQH4XU6IjB9SZAWKjQ |website=www.ntv.com.tr |access-date=4 November 2022 |language=tr}}</ref>

[[File:Akhisar_Pasha_Cami_6190.jpg|left|thumb|Akhisar Pasha Mosque.]]
The 16th century Sultan Mosque was built for [[Ayşe Hafsa Sultan]], [[Süleyman the Magnificent]]'s mother. In her honor, Mesir Festival (featuring the "[[Mesir Paste]]" ({{langx|tr|Mesir Macunu}}), a spiced paste in the form of candy, and claimed to restore health, youth and potency, is held every year in March, in the grounds of this mosque, and is an occasion for public gathering as well as attendance by personalities of fame and prominence at national scale.

The mosque is part of a large [[külliye]] - a religious complex - among whose buildings the hospital "[[darüşşifa]]" is particularly notable. Specialized in [[mental diseases]], the medical center was in activity until the beginning of the 20th century when new buildings were built within the same compound. That Turkey's only two institutions specialized on mental health were until recently located in İstanbul district of [[Bakırköy]] and in Manisa gave way in Turkey's public lore to gentle [[innuendo]]s on the challenging spirit of the natives - ''Manisalı''.

One such likeable eccentric of the 20th century was Ahmet Bedevi, the [[Tarzan of Manisa]] or "Manisa Tarzanı", a figure who became a symbol for the city by contributing to raising consciousness for protection of the environment across Turkey and a reference especially since the 1960s when an important reforestation effort covering thousands of hectares was made in and around Manisa.<ref>{{cite book | title = A survey of Sardis and the major monuments outside the city walls| page= 171|isbn= 978-0-674-85751-3 | author= George Maxim Anossov Hanfmann - Jane C. Waldba | publisher= [[Harvard University Press]]| year= 1975}}</ref>

The [[Muradiye Mosque, Manisa|Muradiye Mosque]] of the 16th century was built by the great architect [[Mimar Sinan]] (and completed by [[Sedefkar Mehmed Agha]]), and the 'Murad Bey Medresse now houses the [[Archaeological Museum of Manisa]].

Manisa celebrates the Vintage Festival every September, when the fruits of the vineyards are celebrated. The vineyards surround the city and provide dry fruit for export from [[İzmir]], and grapes for wine making.

Manisa and some of its depending district centers have succeeded in solidly clinching an industrial production base in recent decades, in this supported both initially and continuously by the century-old wide-scale agricultural processing and related activities (production of flour and [[olive oil]], basic textiles, [[leather goods]], agricultural tools and instruments, cotton [[ginning]]). Olive, walnut and almond cultivation are among the important agricultural activities of Manisa.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Gazete|first=Banka|date=21 November 2021|title=Manisalı üreticilere fidan desteği devam ediyor|page=https://gazetebanka.com/|work=Gazete Banka|url=https://gazetebanka.com/manisali-ureticilere-fidan-destegi-devam-ediyor/11362/|access-date=21 November 2021}}</ref>

According to the figures published by the Governorship, 694 companies in Manisa Province out of the province's total number of companies of 5,502 for 2007 are certified industrial enterprises and these employ a total of 44,449 people. Within the 694, Manisa center is in the lead with 238 enterprises engaged in industrial production, with the depending centers of [[Turgutlu]] (125 industrial enterprises), [[Akhisar]] (100), [[Salihli]] (78) closely contending, and [[Saruhanlı]] (33), Alaşehir (30), [[Kula, Manisa|Kula]] (28), [[Demirci]] (20) and Soma (17) following.{{efn |1=The counts given exclude Soma's lignite mines (10 million tonnes produced in 2007) and [[thermal power plant]] (7 billion kWh electricity production in 2007).}}

Among leading industrial activities Manisa companies are engaged in are production of foodstuffs (''196 companies''), building materials (''114''), metal goods (''85''), as well as textile industry and clothing industry (''46'') and cotton ginning (''43''). The highest numbers of workforce are concentrated in electronics/electrical appliances, foodstuffs and construction industries.

The choice of Manisa as production base in the 1980s by the Turkish [[consumer electronics]] and [[white goods]] giant [[Vestel]] was an important boost for the present-day level of sophistication. Today Manisa's economic activities are far from being confined to a sole company. Manisa registered roughly 200m US dollars in FDI in 2004 and well-known businesses such as Italian white goods company [[Indesit]], German electrical goods company [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], UK [[packaging]] company [[Rexam]] and [[Imperial Tobacco]] of the UK have invested in Manisa.

In 2004/2005 Manisa was chosen among 200 contestants as the Most Cost-Effective European city by the [[FDi magazine]]'s yearly round of votes to determine European Cities and Regions of the Future, its extremely low office and industrial rents and competitive labor costs having been particularly noted.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.fdimagazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/900/Most_cost_effective:_Manisa,_Turkey.html |title = Most cost effective: Manisa, Turkey|publisher=[[FDi magazine]]|date=2004-10-20}}</ref> Again for 2006/2007, Manisa was named among 89 European cities as the winner of the category of the Best Economic Potential in Europe, as runner-up for the categories Southern-Europe's City of the Future (winner for Turkey) and the Most Cost-Effective European city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fdimagazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1543 |title=European Cities of the Future 2006/07 |author=Charles Piggott |publisher=[[FDi magazine]] |access-date=2007-10-24  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927004828/http://www.fdimagazine.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/1543 |archive-date=2007-09-27 }} Manisa was closely seconded in the ranking by [[Konya]], [[Bursa]], [[Sivas]], [[Gaziantep]], [[Denizli]] and [[Eskişehir]].</ref>

The city also has a [[association football|football]] team, [[Manisaspor]], which plays in the [[Süper Lig]] under the home colors of red and white and away colors of black and white. Manisaspor's home ground is the [[Manisa 19 Mayis Stadi]].
