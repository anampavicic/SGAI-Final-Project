'''Valledupar''' ({{IPA|es|baʝeðuˈpaɾ}}) is a city and municipality in northeastern [[Colombia]]. It is the capital of [[Cesar Department]]. Its name, ''Valle de Upar'' (Valley of Upar), was established in honor of the [[Amerindian]] [[cacique]] who ruled the valley; ''Cacique Upar''. The city lies between the mountains of the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]] and the [[Serranía del Perijá]] to the borders of the [[Guatapurí River|Guatapurí]] and [[Cesar River|Cesar]] rivers.<ref name=alcvalledupar>[http://www.valledupar.gov.co/infoNoticia.asp?IdNot=39 Alcaldia Valledupar: Historia de Valledupar] {{in lang|es}} valledupar.gov.co Accessed 8 October 2006.</ref>

Valledupar is an important agricultural, [[ranching|cattle raising]], coal mining and agro-industrial center for the region between the Departments of Cesar and southern municipalities of [[La Guajira Department]], formerly known as the [[Padilla Province]]. Valledupar is notable as the cradle of ''[[vallenato]]'' music, representative of the Colombian culture. The city hosts the [[Vallenato Legend Festival]].

During the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s, the city suffered during the [[Colombian Armed Conflict]], with numerous kidnappings,<ref name=nytimes>[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/20/international/americas/20colombia.html?ex=1261285200&en=aeb9a3b334d843ee&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland "From Colombia's Upper Class, Rebel and His Foil Diverged"], ''New York Times''{{in lang|es}} Accessed 8 October 2006.</ref> thousands of people forced out<ref name=presidencia>[http://www.presidencia.gov.co/cne/diciembre/31/04122002.htm "Viviendas para desplazados de Valledupar"], Presidencia de Colombia {{in lang|es}}, Accessed 8 October 2006.</ref> and failure to control crime.

== Geography ==
Valledupar is located southeast of the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]]. Its average temperature is 28 [[Celsius|°C]]. Because of its relatively high altitude and proximity to the equator, it has a [[Life zone|variety of environments]], from warm heat to perpetual snow. Notable geographic features in Valledupar include the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta's peaks; the Codazzi, El Guardian, the Ojeda and La Reina. Many rivers descend from its snowy peaks and lagoons; the Ariguani, Ariguanicito, Badillo, Calderas, Cesar, Curiba, Donachui, Garupal, Guatapuri, which borders the city of Valledupar; and the Mariangola.

The Municipality of Valledupar is bordered on the north with the municipalities of [[Riohacha]] and [[San Juan del Cesar]] in the department of [[La Guajira]]. To the south are the municipalities of [[El Paso, Cesar|El Paso]] and [[Los Robles La Paz]] in the [[Cesar Department|department of Cesar]]; to the east are the municipalities of Villanueva and Urumita, also in the Department of [[La Guajira]]; and to the west are the municipalities Fundacion and [[Aracataca]], in the department of [[Magdalena Department|Magdalena]].

The municipality has an area of about 4,977.96&nbsp;km², from which 72,660&nbsp;km² pertain to the [[Arhuaco|Arhuacos]] Indian Reserve, 399.52&nbsp;km² to the [[Kogui and Wiwa Indian Reserve]], and 425.60&nbsp;km² to the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta National Park]].

=== Fauna and flora ===
The municipality is home to numerous endemic species, mostly living in the ecosystem of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and Serrania del Perijá mountains, one of the most biodiverse places in the world. The most recently discovered species of bees was found in rural areas of Valledupar and named [http://apoidea.lifedesks.org/pages/28768 Stelis vallenata] in tribute to the local Vallenato music.

The city's symbolic bird is the [[Turpial]]. Other notable birds that inhabit the region are the [[brotogeris jugularis|parrots]] that flock the fruit trees year round.

During the colonial period, Spaniards introduced invasive European fauna into the region, such as dogs, cats, rats, mice, cattle, horses, mules, goats and [[Numida meleagris|gallineta africana]], doves, among others. Spaniards also introduced numerous species of flora from all over the world into the region, most notably [[mango]] trees, which have become the most popular tree in the city and municipality. However, the symbolic trees of the city are two types of [[Tabebuia|Yellow Tabebuia]], colloquially called "''Cañaguate''" and ''Puy''. These trees cover the region with their notorious yellow blossom flowers during the dry season.

The entities in charge of protecting and controlling the fauna and flora in the region are the Colombian Ministry of Environment, the local decentralized agency [[Corpocesar]], under the Governor of the Cesar Department and Environmental Police of the Colombian National Police. Other non-profit organizations collaborate with these entities.

=== Climate ===
Climate in the municipality of Valledupar is determined by altitude. Half of the region is mountainous and the rest is plains in between the mountain ranges of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Serrania del Perijá. Throughout the year, the region has two dry seasons and two rainy seasons affected by [[El Niño]] and [[La Niña]] phenomena. The peaks of the mountainous region gets snow during the rainy season and much cooler days and depending on the weather, the entire region gets hit lightly by [[hail]]storms and thunderstorms. The regions is slightly affected by the annual Caribbean hurricane season.
The levels of rivers and bodies of water increase in the rainy season, and vegetation grows green and bushy. During the dry season, vegetation dries and turns mostly yellow, while bodies of water decrease in volume.

In 2013, Valledupar was classified on average as the hottest place in Colombia, according to the Colombian Meteorological Institute, [[IDEAM]].

== History ==

{{Main|History of Valledupar}}

[[File:Hernandodesantana.png|thumb|left|200px|Statue honoring Cpt Hernando de Santana, founder of Valledupar.]]

The Spanish named the Valle de Upar (Valley of Upar) after a legendary local Amerindian [[cacique]], Upar, leader of the indigenous [[Chimila people|Chimila]]. The region was first explored by Pedro de Badillo. It was conquered in 1532 by the German [[Ambrosius Ehinger]], governor of Venezuela, who invaded the area belonging to the government of Santa Marta. The city was founded in 1550 by the Spanish conquistador, Captain [[Hernando de Santana]], who named it. The Catholic Church commonly referred to the city as ''Ciudad de los Santos Reyes de Valle de Upar'' (city of the holy kings of Valledupar) because it was founded on the 6th day of January, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], the day the [[three kings]] visited the infant [[Jesus]]. The name was gradually modified to Valle Dupar and then to Valledupar.

Since the colonization period, the region has been a center for imports from the Caribbean area and distribution to the inland. Spaniards traveled through the area and established extensive farming, mainly rearing imported European cattle (among many animals) and agriculture. Much of the population of the Chimila Nation died from epidemics of new infectious diseases carried by the Europeans; survivors were worked at forced labor, and many died during battles.

On May 22, 1810, some 400 inhabitants of the [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]] of the Valle de Upar rebelled against the Spanish monarchy, protesting against Mayor Colonel Marques de Valde-Hoyos. The mayor fled to neighboring [[San Juan del Cesar]], leaving in charge V. Ruiz de Gomez. In 1813 independence from Spain was proclaimed by [[María Concepción Loperena]] de Fernandez de Castro, a wealthy land owner who helped supply three hundred horses to ''El Libertador'' [[Simón Bolívar]]'s revolutionary army.

In 1850, the city became capital of the [[Valledupar Province]] and in 1864 was elevated to capital of the [[Valledupar Department]] of the [[Federal State of Magdalena]]. In 1915, after the political and administrative division restructuring of the Unitarian Colombian State, Valledupar was proclaimed the municipality of the [[Valledupar Province]], part of the [[Federal State of Magdalena]] during the [[United States of Colombia]] era. The region maintained  relative isolation from the rest of the country due to its low importance at the time.  The violent political struggles of the different governments of Colombia took place mostly in larger cities, such as [[Bogotá]].

[[File:Valledupardowntown.png|thumb|right|200px|Downtown '''Valledupar''' preserves much Spanish colonial architecture.]]

During World War II, the city received many immigrants from Europe, especially French, Germans and Italians.  Later it attracted immigrants from the Middle East. In 1956 it was proclaimed a parish by the Catholic Church.  After the Republic of Colombia was created and the [[Cesar Department|Department of Cesar]] was established in 1967, Valledupar became its capital.

The region started developing quickly due to political support from the former President [[Alfonso López Michelsen]], first governor of the Department of Cesar's and the [[Colombian Liberal Party]]. Valledupar came to be known as ''sorpresa caribe'' (the Caribbean surprise) because of its rapid economic growth during the 1970s, especially in cotton production, which local people called "white gold".  Valledupar ranked second overall in economic profits for Colombia during this time.  Urban growth and social change accompanied prosperity and the city developed its cultural identity throughout these years.  The revival of the ''[[Vallenato]]'' music strongly symbolizes the culture of Colombia.

A period of violence erupted during the mid-1980s, disrupting the peaceful growth. A struggling leftist political party, [[Patriotic Union (Colombia)|the Patriotic Union (U.P.)]], was led by a banker, Juvenal Ovidio Ricardo Palmera Pineda.<ref name="nytimes" /> Because of his incendiary remarks during a peasant strike and protest in the main plaza, he was jailed.  After being given amnesty by Jorge Dangond Daza, the governor of the Department, Palmera went into hiding.  The national government and conservative groups started a persecution of UP's leaders and followers.  Many of Palmera's followers went into exile in Europe.<ref name="nytimes" />

He escaped into the mountains, taking refuge with the armed branch of the UP; the [[FARC]].  Palmera became a guerrilla leader; as a banker, he knew who in the city and region were wealthy. He began kidnapping (and sometimes killing) prominent political leaders, journalists and rich land owners (including members of his own family), using the ransoms to finance his organization. He took the alias ''[[Simón Trinidad]]''.<ref name="nytimes" />

During this period, general crime rose and, on October 15, 1994, [[Robbery on the Bank of the Republic|the national bank ''El Banco de la Republica'' (Bank of the Republic) was robbed]]. The amount stolen: COP$24,075 million of non emitted bills (some US$11 million) and came to be known as the "''El Robo del Siglo''" (The bank heist of the century).<ref name=banrep>[http://www.banrep.gov.co/billetes_monedas/bm_impt_logro.htm Banrep: Bank heist of the century] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609230847/http://www.banrep.gov.co/billetes_monedas/bm_impt_logro.htm |date=2007-06-09 }} {{in lang|es}} banrep.gov.co Accessed 8 October 2006.</ref>

To counter [[FARC]] and [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]]'s abuses, and after approximately fifteen years of asphyxiating Valledupar's society and supporting negligence by the Colombian military, some prominent leaders of Valledupar, landowners and those victims of these organizations decided to become part or promote, self-defense forces that later on affiliated with the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]] and assigned another "Vallenatean" as leader [[Rodrigo Tovar Pupo]] a.k.a. [[Jorge 40]].<ref name="nytimes" />

The self-defense forces adopted methods like the guerrilla, including illegal [[drug trafficking]] to finance their operations. They used terrorism tactics that also affected innocent people, such as selective and random kidnappings, and combinations of racketeering and selective assassinations – the trademark of Death Squads. The [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]] helped take back the region from guerrillas, but Valledupar residents had to deal with similar uncertainty in having an illegal and terrorist organization controlling the city.

The AUC northern block demobilized March 10, 2006.<ref name=eltiempo>[http://www.eltiempo.com/conflicto/noticias/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3230383.html Diario El Tiempo: Se entregó 'Jorge 40', jefe desmovilizado del Bloque Norte de las Autodefensas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225122725/http://www.eltiempo.com/conflicto/noticias/ARTICULO-WEB-NOTA_INTERIOR-3230383.html |date=2007-02-25 }} {{in lang|es}} eltiempo.com Accessed 8 October 2006.</ref> It is still uncertain if the Colombian military can control the two terrorist organizations or dismantle them. Because of the longstanding violence, many rural people migrated into the city.  Prominent regional leaders have been killed; others were forced into bankruptcy or out of the region.

Despite the violence, since it became capital of the [[Department of Cesar]], Valledupar developed as an important agricultural and cattle raising center for the region between the departments of Cesar and southern parts of [[La Guajira]].  It is most notable as the cradle of [[vallenato]] music, which is played with [[accordion]], a small drum (''caja'') and a scraping instrument (''[[guacharaca]]'').  Since 1968 at the end of April, the city has held an annual four-day festival, the [[Vallenato Legend Festival]].

== Politics ==

{{Main|Politics of Valledupar}}

The Department of Cesar's government and Chamber of Deputies offices are based in Valledupar as well as other Department level entities. At City level, the Mayor of the City and the City counselors have a three-year term in office, and are in charge of local government issues. The mayor's powers are highly dependent on the budgets assigned by the Departmental government in order to execute plans.

Many local government leaders have been involved in corruption cases, investigated and sometimes incarcerated. The government bureaucracy is highly politicized, with the execution of some plans dependent on political interests and winning advantages over political adversaries.  The local judiciary is also vulnerable to corruption, as well as being a target of terrorists and guerrillas.

=== Ethnicities ===

Three groups of [[Amerindians]], part of the [[Tairona]] culture, are based near this region inside Indian reserves, all named for the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta: the [[Arhuaco]] Reserve (pop. 18,500); the [[Kankuamo people|Kankuamo]] Reserve (pop. 12,000) and the [[Kogi people|Kogi]]-[[Wiwa people|Wiwa]] Reserve (pop. 4,500). The Amerindian cultures have contributed traditional arts and crafts, as well as many crop management. Africans contributed to the food, religion and music and Europeans contributed to architecture, growth of the Catholic religion and other aspects, especially that of the Spanish colonial period.

The [[Vallenato]] music has been a creole fusion of these three cultures; the European [[accordion]], the African [[drum]] and percussive elements, and the "[[guacharaca]]" from the Amerindians.

Other waves of European immigrants came during the 1940s to 1950s while trying to escape World War II or social crisis; mostly from Spain, Germany and France.

From approximately the 1960s, waves of immigrants from the Middle East started arriving in the city. They have been sympathetically nicknamed ''Turcos'' ([[Turkish people|Turks]]) by locals. Immigrants have been welcomed and are able to become part of society, marrying into traditional Valledupar families.

== Economy ==

The economy of Valledupar is based primarily on commerce, retail and banking in the urban area, mainly in the service industry and tourism during the four-day [[Vallenato Legend Festival]]. The city also serves as a business hub for the two nearby coal mines, Cerrejon (La Guajira) and Drummond (Cesar).
The region's economy also relies on the primary sector; [[Agriculture]] and [[ranching|cattle raising]] which are the historical backbone of the local economy. During the 1970s, the region experienced an economic boom because of a massive production of cotton when worldwide demand was high. This helped to modernize Valledupar, and it became the second most productive region in [[Colombia]] for some time. The cotton boom ended during the 1980s because of a decrease in cotton production during the years of violence. The resulting economic recession left many in debt and unable to repay loans to the banks. During these years ''marimberos'', or marijuana sellers, also produced and contributed to the economic boom, because of the high demand in the United States.

Valledupar mainly produces cotton, [[rice]], [[oil palm]], [[tobacco]], [[coffee]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and other cash crops. Since the late 20th century, the city has benefited  from the department of Cesar's development of [[coal mining]] in the region of [[La Jagua de Ibirico]] and [[El Paso, Cesar|El Paso]]. The secondary sector has been flourishing from a few agricultural products and derivates from [[cattle]].

Terrorist groups are still present and affect the local economy; The [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]], [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]] and former [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]], mostly financed by the [[illegal drug trade]]. Other mafia-style groups [[BACRIM]]s have flourished in the region, shifting from illegal drug production to illegal trafficking of fuel from Venezuela as well as other products. These groups contribute to the [[illicit drugs]] industry in the region.  They cultivate great quantities of opium [[amapola (flower)|poppies]] and [[marihuana]] around the area.

The region is using technology in order to develop into a more modern city. In a smaller scale, other sources of the economy are: [[fishing]], [[transportation]], [[construction]], industrial manufacturing, [[electricity]] and [[Natural gas|gas]], [[commerce]], [[hotel]] industry, [[government]], [[real estate]], [[education]], [[healthcare]] and [[Domestic worker|domestic services]].

The [[Vallenato Legend Festival]], has gained economic importance because of its impact in Valledupar's economy. The Festival has become a destination for the [[tourist industry]], and enables the promotion of other local products.  The region's contemporary arts and crafts, [[ecotourism]] and cuisine have contributed to a growing [[hospitality industry]].

In 2006 during the [[Vallenato Legend Festival]], the [[Federación Nacional de Cafeteros de Colombia]] agreed to promote local coffee as one of their products, under the name ''Cafe Festival de la Leyenda Vallenata'' (Vallenato Legend Festival Coffee).  This effort is to promote coffee produced by the local small and medium-sized farms from the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta and the Serranía del Perijá.

Valledupar annually hosts one of the most important Cattle Fairs (Spanish: Ferias Ganaderas) in Colombia at the end of August.  It is also an opportunity to feature other agricultural and domestic products.

== Culture ==

Valledupar's cultural background comes from three different major cultures; African, European, and Amerindian.  The creolization of these cultures developed into unique musical styles, such as in the [[vallenato]] and [[cumbia]]. Valledupar was established as a Spanish colonial town, where colonists tried to reimpose what they knew in terms of familiar customs, food, popular religion, music, dances and [[Spanish language|Castilian Spanish]].

Many descendants from the colonial period were converted to Catholicism. At the same time, practices have absorbed aspects of Amerindian and African cultures, as Christianity is syncretic. The holy week, in April, is celebrated in much the same way as during colonial times; with fasting, church attendance and processions to venerate Jesus and the ''[[Santo Eccehomo]]''. [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] is celebrated in July. In religious practices, Christians represent the majority of the population.  There are a minority of Muslims.

[[File:Ipê (Avaré) REFON.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A flowering ''[[Tabebuia chrysantha|Tecoma chrysostricha]]'' known as ''Cañaguate'' colloquially.]]

Traditional oral [[storytelling]] has helped preserve stories, [[Mythology|myths]] and [[legend]]s, such as the popular "legend of the guatapuri mermaid", or the "silborcito" (the nazarenian without a head), "the Lerta" ("The duel between the devil and Francisco 'the man'"), "the monitos", "The llorona (the crying woman)", "la madre monte (mother nature)" "la mano pelua (the hairy hand)", and "el cuco", among other stories that are still alive. Storytellers are very common in the region, as well as traditional comedians. These storytellers, usually travelling farmers selling their cattle around the region, revived the already traditional Spanish ''juglares'' ([[minstrels]]). From village to village, they sang the news and stories from other towns, usually playing an instrument. This is how the [[Vallenato]] music was believed to be born.

Dances play a very important role in the cultural identity of this society, coming from the three different cultures that founded it, among this dances are: "Tambora La Cumaná" "El Pilon [[Vallenato]]" "chicote kankuamo" and "Los Diablos danzantes de Corpus Christi" ([[The Corpus Christi Dancing Devils]]).  The latter originated in a colonial theater play, developed to represent the devil and good, in an effort to convert the Amerindians to Christianity.
Valledupar also celebrates a carnival in February, smaller but similar to [[Barranquilla's Carnival]]. Carnival's celebration of pagan traditions, and quickly helped the African and Amerindian traditions to become part of society.

== Transportation ==

[[File:Bus terminal of Valledupar.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Bus terminal of Valledupar.]]

Valledupar has four different land entrances, and is crossed by national highway Route 80 from south to north. Route 80 is still under-construction, a segment between the village of Badillo via the village of Patillal and the town of [[San Juan del Cesar]] in the department of [[La Guajira]]. As an alternative route 80 also crosses the town of [[Los Robles La Paz|La Paz]] in order to drive north to the northern department of [[La Guajira]]. To the south, the route 80 highway connects with the rest of [[Colombia]] including northern regions of Colombia, like [[Santa Marta]], [[Barranquilla]] and [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]]; to the west two road access to some other villages to the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]].

Valledupar's land transportation terminal provides national and international services through sixteen different bus or van transportation companies. Four of whom make trips to rural areas of the municipality. In the urban area transportation services are provided by [[Taxicab|taxis]], and by private and government bus companies covering the entire city by shared routes. Lately, a new form of transportation was born, informal [[Auto rickshaw]]s (mototaxismo), taking illegally over the bus and taxi services, to a point that are making them go bankrupt. The local government is attempting to penalize the use of Auto rickshaw for safety reasons and are also operating illegally, but because there are so many and tend to violently protest, the issue became difficult. In 2014 the local government expects to introduce the new Massive Strategic Transportation System (''Sistema Estrategico de Transporte Público'', SETP) with new routes and more modern buses.

Valledupar is served by the [[Alfonso López Pumarejo Airport]], that receives national and some charter flights.
