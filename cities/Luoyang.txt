'''Luoyang''' <!--Chinese in infobox-->({{zh|s=洛阳|t=洛陽|p=Luòyáng}}) is a city located in the confluence area of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] and the [[Yellow River]] in the west of [[Henan]] province, China. Governed as a [[prefecture-level city]], it borders the provincial capital of [[Zhengzhou]] to the east, [[Pingdingshan]] to the southeast, [[Nanyang, Henan|Nanyang]] to the south, [[Sanmenxia]] to the west, [[Jiyuan]] to the north, and [[Jiaozuo]] to the northeast. As of December 31, 2018, Luoyang had a population of 6,888,500 inhabitants with 2,751,400 people living in the built-up (or metro) area made of the city's five out of six urban districts (except the [[Jili District]] not continuously urbanized) and [[Yanshi District]], now being conurbated.<ref name="citypopulation.de">{{Cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/china/henan/admin/|title=China: Hénán (Prefectures, Cities, Districts and Counties) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map|website=www.citypopulation.de|access-date=2021-03-27|archive-date=2017-10-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171024153510/http://www.citypopulation.de/php/china-henan-admin.php|url-status=live}}</ref> By the end of 2022, Luoyang Municipality had jurisdiction over 7 municipal districts, 7 counties and 1 development zone.

Situated on the [[Central Plain (China)|central plain]] of China, Luoyang is among the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities#East Asia|oldest cities in China]] and one of the [[History of China#Ancient China|cradles of Chinese civilization]]. It is the earliest of the [[Historical capitals of China|Four Great Ancient Capitals of China]].

==Etymology==
{{unreferencedsect|date=September 2024}}
The name "Luoyang" originates from the city's location on the north or sunny ([[Yin and yang#Toponymy|"yang"]]) side of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]]. Since the river flows from west to east and the sun is to the south of the river, the sun always shines on the north side of the river. Luoyang has had several names over the centuries, including '''Luoyi''' ({{lang|zh|洛邑}}) and '''Luozhou''' ({{lang|zh|洛州}}), but Luoyang has been its primary name.  It has also been called '''Dongdu''' ({{zh|labels=no|t=東都 |l=eastern capital}}) during the [[Tang dynasty]], '''Xijing''' ({{zh|labels=no|c=西京 |l=western capital}}) during the [[Song dynasty]], or '''Jingluo''' ({{zh|c=京洛|l=capital Luo}}).  During the rule of [[Wu Zetian]], the only [[empress regnant|female emperor]] in Chinese history, the city was known as '''Shendu''' ({{zh|labels=no|c=神都|l=divine capital}}). Luoyang was renamed '''Henanfu''' ({{lang|zh|河南府}}) during the [[Qing dynasty]] but regained its former name in 1912.

==History==
===Classical era===
[[File:天子驾六.jpg|thumb|left|220x220px|Museum of Luoyang Eastern Zhou Royal Horse and Chariot Pits]]
The greater Luoyang area has been sacred ground since the late [[Neolithic|Neolithic period]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Far East Kingdoms |url=https://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/ChinaCultures.htm |website=Early Chinese Cultures |access-date=24 January 2020 |archive-date=22 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181222014612/http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/ChinaCultures.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> Several cities – all of which are generally referred to as "Luoyang" – have been built in this area. In 2070&nbsp;BC, the [[Xia dynasty]] king [[Tai Kang]] moved the Xia capital to the intersection of the Luo and Yi and named the city [[Zhenxun]] ({{lang|zh-hant|斟鄩}}). In 1600&nbsp;BC, [[Tang of Shang]] defeated [[Jie of Xia|Jie]], the final Xia dynasty king, and built Western Bo,  ({{lang|zh|西亳}}), a new capital on the Luo River. The ruins of Western Bo are located in Luoyang Prefecture.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

In 1036&nbsp;BC a settlement named Chengzhou ({{lang|zh|成周}}) was constructed by the [[Duke of Zhou]] for the remnants of the captured [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] nobility. The Duke also moved the [[Nine Tripod Cauldrons]] to [[Chengzhou]] from the [[Zhou dynasty]] capital at [[Haojing]]. A second Western Zhou capital, [[Wangcheng (Zhou dynasty)|Wangcheng]] (also: Luoyi) was built {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} west of Chengzhou.  Wangcheng became the capital of the [[Eastern Zhou dynasty]] in 771&nbsp;BC.  The Eastern Zhou dynasty capital was moved to Chengzhou in 510&nbsp;BC. Later, the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] capital of Luoyang would be built over Chengzhou.  Modern Luoyang is built over the ruins of Wangcheng, which are still visible today at Wangcheng Park.<ref>China.org.cn, 2009</ref>

[[Qin Shi Huang|Qin Shi Huang's]] chief minister, Lu Buwei, was given Luoyang. Lu began programs to develop and beautify Luoyang. It is said that [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Liu Bang]] visited Luoyang and considered making it his capital but was persuaded to reconsider by his ministers to turn to [[Chang'an]] instead for his capital.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=538–541|editor2-last=Salkin|editor2-first=Robert}}</ref>

===Han dynasty===
[[File:China-henan-luoyang-white-horse-temple-entrance-20040506.jpg|left|thumb|220x220px|[[White Horse Temple]] gate]]
In 25 AD, Luoyang was declared the capital of the Eastern Han dynasty on November 27 by [[Emperor Guangwu of Han]].<ref name="Hymes">{{cite book |author=[[Robert Hymes]] |url=https://archive.org/details/columbiachronolo00john |title=Columbia Chronologies of Asian History and Culture |publisher=Columbia University Press |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-231-11004-4 |editor=John Stewart Bowman |page=[https://archive.org/details/columbiachronolo00john/page/13 13] |url-access=registration}}</ref>  The city walls formed a rectangle 4&nbsp;km south to north and 2.5&nbsp;km west to east, with the Gu River, a tributary of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo River]] just outside the northern eastern walls.  The rectangular Southern Palace and the Northern Palace were 3&nbsp;km apart and connected by The Covered Way.  In 26 AD, the Altar of the Gods of the Soils and Grains, the Altar of Heaven, and the Temple of the eminent Founder, [[Emperor Gaozu of Han|Emperor Gao]] of Former Han were inaugurated.  The Imperial University was restored in 29 AD. In 48 AD, the Yang Canal linked the capital to the Luo. In 56 AD, the main imperial observatory, the Spiritual Terrace, was constructed.<ref name="Rafe">{{cite book |last1=de Crespigny |first1=Rafe |title=Fire over Luoyang: A History of the Later Han Dynasty 23–220 AD |date=2017 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=9789004324916 |pages=16–52}}</ref>

For several centuries, Luoyang was the focal point of China. In AD 68, the [[White Horse Temple]], the first [[Buddhist]] temple in China, was founded in Luoyang.{{cn|date=October 2024}} The temple still exists, though the architecture is of later origin, mainly from the 16th century. [[An Shigao]] was one of the first monks to popularize [[Buddhism]] in Luoyang.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

The diplomat [[Ban Chao]] restored the [[Silk Road]] during the Eastern Han dynasty, thus making Luoyang the eastern terminus of the Silk  Road during the Han dynasty.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

In 166 AD, the first [[Sino-Roman relations|Roman mission]], sent by "the king of Da Qin [the Roman Empire], Andun" ([[Marcus Aurelius|Marcus Aurelius Antoninus]], r. 161–180 AD), reached Luoyang after arriving by sea in [[Rinan]] Commandery in what is now central [[Vietnam]].<ref>Hill (2009), p. 27.</ref>

The late 2nd century saw China decline into anarchy:

<blockquote>The decline was accelerated by the rebellion of the [[Yellow Turbans]], who, although defeated by the Imperial troops in 184 AD, weakened the state to the point where there was a continuing series of rebellions degenerating into civil war, culminating in the burning of the Han capital of Luoyang on 24 September 189 AD. This was followed by a state of continual unrest and wars in China until a modicum of stability returned in the 220s, but with the establishment of three separate kingdoms, rather than a unified empire.<ref>Hill (2009), p. xvi,</ref></blockquote>

===Wei and Jin dynasties===

The court was subsequently moved to the more defensible western city of [[Chang'an]] (modern Xi'an). Following a period of disorder, during which warlord [[Cao Cao]] held the last Han emperor [[Han Xiandi|Xian]] in [[Xuchang]] (196–220), Luoyang was restored to prominence when his son Cao Pi, [[Cao Pi|Emperor Wen]] of the [[Cao Wei|Wei dynasty]], declared it his capital in 220 AD. The [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]], successor to Wei, was also established in Luoyang.

In 422, the city was captured by [[Xianbei]]-led [[Northern Wei|Northern Wei dynasty]]. The [[Liu Song|Liu Song dynasty]], which succeeded the Jin, briefly recovered the city in 430, but by the 460s, Luoyang was definitively under Wei control. In 493 AD, as part of his [[sinicization]] campaign, [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei]] moved the capital from [[Datong]] to Luoyang, moving over 150,000 people to the site by 495,<ref name=":2">{{Cite book |last=Graff |first=David A. |title=Medieval Chinese Warfare, 300 - 900 |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |pages=98}}</ref> and started the construction of the [[rock-cut architecture|rock-cut]] [[Longmen Grottoes]].

The [[Yongning Pagoda|Yongning Temple]] ({{lang|zh-hans|永宁寺}}), the tallest pagoda in China, was also built in Luoyang. The city reached a population of 600,000 at its height during the Northern Wei.<ref name=":2" /> The city was destroyed by the warlord [[Gao Huan]], who captured the city and forced its population to move to his capital at [[Ye (Hebei)|Ye]] in 534.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Graff |first=David A. |title=Medieval Chinese Warfare |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |pages=103}}</ref> The old city was the site of numerous battles between [[Western Wei]] (and its successor [[Northern Zhou]]) and [[Eastern Wei]] (and its successor [[Northern Qi]]) between 538 and 575.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

During the [[Tang dynasty]], Luoyang was Dongdu ({{lang|zh-hant|東都}}), the "Eastern Capital", and at its height had a population of around one million, second only to Chang'an, which, at the time, was the largest city in the world.<ref>Abramson (2008), p. viii.</ref>

During an interval in the Tang dynasty, the first and the only empress in Chinese history – [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], moved the capital of her Zhou dynasty to Luoyang and named it as Shen Du (Capital of the God). She constructed the tallest palace in Chinese history, which is now in the site of Sui Tang Luoyang city. Luoyang was heavily damaged during the [[An Lushan Rebellion]].<ref name=":0" />

[[Epitaph]]s were found dating from the Tang dynasty of a Christian couple in Luoyang of a Nestorian Christian Sogdian woman, Lady An (安氏), who died in 821, and her Nestorian Christian Han Chinese  husband, Hua Xian (花献), who died in 827.

During the short [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], Luoyang was the capital of the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]] (only for a few years before the court moved to [[Kaifeng]]) and [[Later Tang]] dynasty.

===Later history===
During the North [[Song dynasty]], Luoyang was the 'Western Capital' and birthplace of Zhao Kuangyin, the founder of the Song dynasty. It served as a prominent cultural center, housing some of the most important philosophers. This prosperity was mainly caused by Luoyang undergoing new developments and reconstruction during this period.<ref name=":0" />

During the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin dynasty]], Luoyang was the "Middle Capital".

Since the [[Yuan dynasty]], Luoyang was no longer the capital of China in the rest of the ancient dynasties. During the Yuan and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, Luoyang was razed and rebuilt twice. Its walls were destroyed by peasant rebels in the late Ming period. The city walls were then rebuilt during the [[Qing dynasty]].<ref name=":0" /> The population was reduced to that of an average county. However, for one last time, Luoyang city was the capital of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] for a brief period of time during the Japanese invasion. By 1949, Luoyang's population was 75,000.

===People's Republic of China===

After the People's Republic of China was established, Luoyang was revived as a major heavy industrial hub. In the [[first five-year plan (China)|first five-year plan of China]], 7 of 156 Soviet-aided major industrial programmes were launched in Luoyang's [[Jianxi District]], including Dongfanghong Tractor Factory, Luoyang Mining Machines Factory and Luoyang Bearing Factory. Later, during the [[Third Front (China)|Third Front]] construction, a group of heavy industry factories was moved to or founded in Luoyang, including Luoyang Glass Factory. Industrial development significantly shifted Luoyang's demographic makeup, and about half of Luoyang's population are new immigrants after 1949 from outside the province or their descendants.

===2021 administrative reorganization===
With the 2017 designation of Zhengzhou as a National Central City, Henan Province in 2020 proposed a new development plan for Zhengzhou Metropolitan Area, which called for the development of Luoyang as a sub-central city. As part of this development, authorities decided to expand the urban area of Luoyang. This not only facilitated planning and coordinated use of resources and infrastructure in Luoyang, but also allowed for better integration towards Zhengzhou, as Yanshi, Jili and Mengjin previously separated the Luoyang urban area from Zhengzhou.<ref name="news.sina.com.cn">{{cite web | url=https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2021-03-28/doc-ikkntiam9617153.shtml | title=河南洛阳扩容，撤县设区还香吗？ | date=28 March 2021 | access-date=2021-09-23 | archive-date=2024-07-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240710124101/https://news.sina.com.cn/c/2021-03-28/doc-ikkntiam9617153.shtml | url-status=live }}</ref>

On 28 March 2021, the central government approved a major administrative reorganization of Luoyang city. [[Yanshi District|Yanshi]] City was reorganized into an urban district (Yanshi District), while [[Jili District|Jili]] District  and [[Mengjin District|Mengjin]] County were merged into Mengjin District. This reorganization effectively doubled the urban area of Luoyang.<ref name="news.sina.com.cn"/>

==Geography==
As [[#Names|its name states]], the Old Town of Luoyang is located on the north bank of the [[Luo River (Henan)|Luo]], a southern tributary of the middle reaches of the [[Yellow River]]. The districts of the modern urban center include both banks and some of the surrounding mountains.

The countryside controlled by the municipal government includes still more rugged land: mountains comprise 45.51% of the total area; hills, 40.73%; and plains, 13.8%.<ref>{{nowrap|{{lang|zh|洛阳市人民政府网站}}}} [Luòyángshì Rénmín Zhèngfǔ Wǎngzhàn, ''Luoyang Municipal People's Government Website''] op.&nbsp;cit. {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|北京2008年奥运火炬接力官方网站}}}} [Běijīng 2008 Nián Àoyùn Huǒjù Jiēlì Guānfāng Wǎngzhàn, ''Beijing 2008 Torch Relay Official Website'']. {{nowrap|[http://torchrelay.beijing2008.cn/cn/journey/luoyang/luoyangnews/n214275161.shtml {{lang|zh|〈洛阳地理及气候概况〉}}]}} ["''Luòyáng Dìlǐ Jí Qìhòu Gàikuàng''", "Overview of Luoyang's Geography and Climate"]. 20&nbsp;Mar&nbsp;2008.

It comprises a wide selection of ingredients, simple and versatile, diverse tastes, sour, spicy, sweet and salty, comfortable and delicious.
