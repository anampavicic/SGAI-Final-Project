'''Piedras Negras''' ({{IPA|es|ˈpjeðɾas ˈneɣɾas|-|ES-pe - Piedras negras.ogg}} {{lit.|Black Rocks}}) is a city and seat of the [[Piedras Negras Municipality|surrounding municipality of the same name]] in the Mexican [[list of states of Mexico|state]] of [[Coahuila]]. It stands at the northeastern edge of Coahuila on the [[Mexico–United States border]], across the [[Rio Grande]] from [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]] in the U.S. state of [[Texas]]. In the 2015 census the city had a population of 163,595 inhabitants,<ref name="inegi.org.mx"/> while the metropolitan area had a population of 245,155 inhabitants.<ref name="inegi.org.mx"/> The Piedras Negras and the Eagle Pass areas are connected by the [[Eagle Pass–Piedras Negras International Bridge]], [[Camino Real International Bridge]], and the [[Union Pacific International Railroad Bridge (Eagle Pass–Piedras Negras)|Union Pacific International Railroad Bridge]]. 

In Spanish, {{lang|es|Piedras Negras}} translates to 'black stones' – a reference to coal deposits in the area. Across the river, coal was formerly mined on the U.S. side at Dolchburg, near Eagle Pass. This mine closed around 1905, after a fire. Mexico currently operates two large [[coal-fired power station]]s named "[[José López Portillo]]" and "Carbón 2" located {{convert|30|mi|km}} south of Piedras Negras. These two coal-fired power plants are currently operated by [[Comisión Federal de Electricidad]], the state-owned Mexican [[electric utility]].

==History==
On June 15, 1850, a group of 34 men (commanded by Andrés Zapata, Gaspar Salazar and Antonio Ramírez) met with Colonel Juan Manuel Maldonado to give the news that they had created a pass point at Piedras Negras, to the right of the [[Rio Grande]], south of [[Fort Duncan]]. They named it Nueva Villa de Herrera, but it later became Villa de Piedras Negras. In Otto Schober's "Breve historia de Piedras Negras," the local historian points out that the 34 men were repatriates (Mexican Americans) who arrived on June 15, 1850, in what was then called "Colonia Militar de Guerrero en Piedras Negras."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.piedrasnegras.gob.mx/contenido05/conoce-pn/historia/|title=Historia|publisher=Piedras Negras|access-date=5 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928115527/http://www.piedrasnegras.gob.mx/contenido05/conoce-pn/historia/|archive-date=28 September 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1855, the town was looted by a small force of 130 Texans that had been organized by [[History of slavery in Texas|Texas slaveholders]] for a punitive expedition against a nearby border settlement the Texans claimed contained fugitive [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. The force was led by a captain of the Texas Rangers.  As it happened, the incursion was opposed and "repelled by a superior force of Negroes, Native Americans, and Mexicans who were waiting in ambush" inside Mexico. But the Ranger-led expedition then looted Piedras Negras while returning to Texas.<ref name=johnson2014>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Nicholas|title=Negroes and The Gun: the black tradition of arms|year=2014|publisher=Prometheus|location=Amherst, New York|isbn=978-1-61614-839-3|page=133}}</ref>

Following the discovery of huge deposits of coal in the region, in 1881 a railroad track was begun that was completed in 1883. The regional economy flourished and on December 1, 1888, it was granted city status; this time with the name of Ciudad Porfirio Díaz. After the fall of Diaz in 1911, the city reverted to being Piedras Negras, Coahuila.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

On April 26, 2004, flooding killed 31 people with up to 60 reported missing.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

On April 24, 2007, [[April 20–26, 2007 tornado outbreak sequence|an F4 tornado struck the city]], killing three people there and seven in Eagle Pass, Texas.<ref>{{cite web|last=Welch|first=William M.|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/weather/storms/tornadoes/2007-04-25-texas-storms_N.htm|title=Border storms' death toll rises to 10 - USATODAY.com|publisher=Usatoday30.usatoday.com|date=26 April 2007|access-date=5 March 2014}}</ref>

From June 14–15, 2013 over 10,000 homes were damaged by flooding and one person was killed.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}

On the night of June 8, 2018, former Piedras Negras mayor {{ill|Fernando Purón|es|Fernando Purón Johnston}} was shot in the back of the head by an unknown man while Purón was taking a selfie with an admirer. Purón died on the spot, becoming the 112th candidate or politician to be killed since Mexico's electoral campaign began in September 2017. Purón was supposed to run in the [[2018 Mexican general election|2018 Mexican election]] on July 1 as a congressional candidate of the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI). Sonia Villarreal, current mayor of Piedras Negras and fellow member of PRI, suspended her mayoral reelection campaign in response to Purón's murder to concentrate on her current duties, stating that "We don't (want) his name to be just one more added to the list of candidates who have been victims of these deplorable acts."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Charner|first1=Flora|title=This Mexican candidate had just vowed to tackle crime.

==Geography==
===Demography===
The Northern Region of [[Coahuila]] has approximately 300,000 inhabitants. According to the [[National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing|National Institute of Statistics, Geography and Data Processing (INEGI)]], in 2005 the population of the ''municipio'' of Piedras Negras was 143,915 inhabitants, equal to 5.77% of the population of Coahuila. 17% of the population of Piedras Negras came from other states, 3% were foreigners, and the rest were born in Coahuila. Piedras Negras has a high population growth due partly to its status as a border city fueled by U.S.-bound exports from several factories and also by persons who hope to cross the border into the United States. It is estimated that in a couple of years it will become the third most populated city of the state of [[Coahuila]], surpassing [[Monclova]]. Nowadays Piedras Negras has more than 200,000 inhabitants.

===Climate===
Piedras Negras has a [[hot semi-arid climate]], having some influences of the dry-winter [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa''). During summer the temperatures often surpass {{convert|45|C|F}}. The hottest months are May through September with a daily average (mean) temperature between {{convert|26|C|F}} and {{convert|31|C|F}}.

The high temperatures recorded in Piedras Negras have earned it recognition as one of the hottest cities in the country.<ref>{{cite news|title=Piedras Negras, una de las ciudades más calientes del país|url=http://www.zocalo.com.mx/seccion/articulo/piedras-negras-una-de-las-ciudades-mas-calientes-del-pais/|access-date=12 April 2011|newspaper=ZÓCALO SALTILLO|date=8 March 2009}}</ref>

Highest precipitation months are May, June and September with an average monthly downfall in excess of {{convert|80|mm|in|1}} but that is highly sporadic lending to frequent drought conditions. The period of lowest precipitation is between December through March, with a monthly average of {{convert|30|mm|in|1}}.
