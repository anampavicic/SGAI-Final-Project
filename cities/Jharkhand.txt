==Etymology==
The word "''Jhar''{{-"}} means 'forest' and "''Khand''{{-"}} means 'land' in various [[Indo-Aryan languages]]. Thus "Jharkhand" means ''forest land''.<ref>{{cite book|first=James|last=Minahan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2WcCIm6WaQC&pg=PA839|title=Encyclopedia of the Stateless Nations: D-K|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=0313316171|pages=839|access-date=8 April 2022}}</ref>

During the 18th century, regions under the Kings of the Chero dynasty, Nagvanshi dynasty, [[Ramgarh Raj|Ramgarh]] and [[Kharagdiha]] became parts of territories of [[East India Company]]. Ramgarh Raj along with estates of other chiefs in the regions were permanently settled as Zamindari estates. The [[Kharagdiha]] [[Rajas]] were settled as Rajas of Raj Dhanwar in 1809, and the Kharagdiha gadis were separately settled as zamindari estates. Some of the notable Kharagdiha Zamindari estates were [[Koderma]], [[Parasnath|Gadi Palganj]] and [[Baghochia|Ledo Gadi]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Hazaribagh District Gazetteer |year=1905|publisher=The Bengal Secretariat Book Depot, Calcutta|url=https://archive.org/details/dli.bengal.10689.13551/page/n5}}</ref> The princely states in the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] came within the [[sphere of influence]] of the [[Maratha Confederacy|Maratha Empire]], but they became tributary states of British East India Company as a result of the [[Anglo-Maratha Wars (disambiguation)|Anglo-Maratha Wars]] and became known as [[Chota Nagpur Tributary States]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.southasiaarchive.com/Content/sarf.100009/231191 |title=Gazetteer - Chota Nagpur Tributary States Gazetteer.

Subjugation, colonisation and imposition of taxes by the British East India Company resulted in spontaneous resistance from the local people. [[Chuar Rebellion]], the first revolt against the British East India Company led by Jagannath Singh Patar in 1767 with the [[Bhumij people|Bhumij]] tribals. The Bhumijes again revolted in 1769–71, led by their Sardar Ghatwals in Dhalbhum. In 1769, [[Raghunath Mahato]] also revolted against the [[East India Company|British East India Company]] (EIC).<ref>{{cite news |title=चुआड़ विद्रोह के महानायक, क्रांतिवीर शहीद रघुनाथ महतो की 277 वीं जयंती |url=https://www.prabhatkhabar.com/state/jharkhand/ranchi/362948 |access-date=9 July 2023 |work=Prabhat Khabar |date=21 March 2015 |language=hi |archive-date=29 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221129172559/https://www.prabhatkhabar.com/state/jharkhand/ranchi/362948 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1771, the revolt against the landlords and the British government was led by [[Tilka Manjhi|Tilka Majhi]], a Paharia leader in Rajmahal Hills. Soon after in 1779, the [[Bhumij people|Bhumij]] tribes again rose in arms against the British rule in Manbhum, called the Chuar Rebellion. In 1807, the Oraons in Barway murdered their landlord from [[Srinagar]]. The [[Munda people|Munda]] tribe rose in revolt in 1811 and 1813. [[Bakhtar Say]] and [[Mundal Singh]], two landowners, fought against the British East India Company in 1812.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/blogs/blog-free-for-all/article5904577.ece |title=A parallel conversation: Martyrs, rebels, and peasants |website=[[The Hindu]] |date=12 April 2014 |access-date=30 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181230181112/https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/blogs/blog-free-for-all/article5904577.ece |archive-date=30 December 2018 |url-status=live  |last1=Yadav |first1=Anumeha }}</ref>

The Hos in Singhbhum revolted in 1820 and a [[Kol uprising|Kol revolt]] occurred in 1832. Also in 1832 the [[Bhumij people|Bhumijs]] revolted again against the British, this time under the leadership of [[Ganga Narayan Singh]], known as the [[Bhumij rebellion|Bhumij Rebellion]]. During the 19th century, large numbers of santals from [[Manbhum]], [[Hazaribagh]], [[Midnapore]] were settled by British in [[Damin-i-koh]] to cultivate the land and generate revenue. But the Santal revolted against tax imposition.
The [[Santhal rebellion]] broke out in 1855 under the leadership of two brothers [[Sidhu and Kanhu Murmu|Sidhu and Kanhu]]. Later the British renamed it as Santal Pargana.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jha|first=Amar Nath|title=Locating the Ancient History of Santal Parganas|date=2009|journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress|volume=70|pages=185–196|issn=2249-1937|jstor=44147668}}</ref>

===Post Independence===
After Indian independence in 1947, the rulers of many states chose to accede to the [[Dominion of India]].

In 1955, the [[Jharkhand Party]], led by Jaipal Singh Munda, submitted a memorandum to the [[States Reorganization Commission]] for a separate Jharkhand state comprising the tribal area of South Bihar, but it was rejected because there were many languages, no link language in the region, tribals were in the minority, Hindustani was the majority language, and it risked adverse effect on the economy of Bihar.<ref name="Concept Publishing Company">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nKqF_AgDd4gC&pg=PA115|title=Small States Syndrome in India|isbn=9788170226918|last1=Kumāra|first1=Braja Bihārī|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|year=1998|pages=115–118|access-date=3 November 2022|archive-date=3 November 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221103090828/https://books.google.com/books?id=nKqF_AgDd4gC&pg=PA115|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OEeHEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT251|title=Sensex Of Regional Parties|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan|author=Aaku Srivastava|page=251|year=2022|isbn=978-9355212368|access-date=5 November 2022|archive-date=7 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230307065102/https://books.google.com/books?id=OEeHEAAAQBAJ&pg=PT251|url-status=live}}</ref>

Later the [[Sadan people]], the native various caste/non-tribal groups, also joined the movement for a separate state.<ref name="Concept Publishing Company"/> In 1972, [[Binod Bihari Mahato]], [[Shibu Soren]] and [[A. K. Roy]] founded [[Jharkhand Mukti Morcha]]. [[Nirmal Mahto]] founded the [[All Jharkhand Students Union]]. They led the movement for a separate state of Jharkhand. The Jharkhand coordination committee (JCC), consisting of [[Ram Dayal Munda]], [[Bisheshwar Prasad Keshari|B. P. Keshri]], [[Binod Bihari Mahato]], Santosh Rana and Suraj Singh Besra started a new initiative and tried to coordinate between different parties.

In July 1988, the [[Bharatiya Janata party]] led by [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], [[Lal Krishna Advani]], and [[Murli Manohar Joshi]] decided to demand a separate state, Vanachal, comprising the forest region of South Bihar in [[Jamshedpur]]. [[Inder Singh Namdhari]], [[Samresh Singh]], and [[Rudra Pratap Sarangi]] were the leaders of the Vanachal movement. They organised several rallies to form a separate state.<ref name="jagran2018">{{cite news|url=https://www.jagran.com/jharkhand/jamshedpur-jharkhand-state-in-existence-18322230.html|title=वनांचल की रूपरेखा, झारखंड का नाम|publisher=jagran|date=17 August 2018|access-date=2 October 2022|archive-date=2 October 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221002052550/https://www.jagran.com/jharkhand/jamshedpur-jharkhand-state-in-existence-18322230.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The central government formed a committee on the Jharkhand matter in 1989. It stressed the need for greater allocation of development funds for the area. There was a provision for limited internal autonomy in the hill area of [[Assam]]. Other [[tribal]] areas were covered by the fifth schedule of the constitution. Chotanagpur and [[Santal]] Pargana development boards were constituted under the chairmanship of the then chief minister of Bihar under the provision of the fifth schedule in 1972. This failed to achieve the desired result. Jharkhand Mukti Morcha wanted more representation and the All Jharkhand Students Union was against it. Due to differences these parties broke away from each other. The All Jharkhand Students Union introduced elements of violence in the movement and called for a boycott of election while Jharkhand Mukti Morcha opposed this. The Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council bill passed in Bihar's legislative assembly in December 1994. The Jharkhand Area Autonomous Council were given responsibility for forty areas including agriculture, rural health, public work, public health and minerals. The council has power to recommend legislation to the Assembly through the state government and to frame bylaws and regulations.<ref name="https"/><ref name="Concept Publishing Company"/>

In 1998, when the separate state movement was falling apart, Justice [[Lal Pingley Nath Shahdeo]] was leading the movement. In 1998, the [[Union government]] decided to send the bill concerning the formation of the state of Jharkhand to the [[Bihar Legislative Assembly]] to which [[Lalu Prasad Yadav]] had said that the state would be divided over his dead body. A total of 16 political parties including the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]], Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, the [[All Jharkhand Students Union]], and the [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] came in one platform and formed the 'All Party Separate State Formation Committee' to start the movement. Shahdeo was elected as the convener of the committee. Voting on the Jharkhand Act was to be done on 21 September 1998 in Bihar legislation. On that day the committee, under the leadership of Shahdeo called for Jharkhand Bandh and organised a protest march. Thousands of supporters of a separate state took to the streets led by Shahdeo. He was arrested and detained in a police station for hours along with many supporters.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2018/state-editions/tributes-pour-in-for-justice-shahdeo.html|title=Tributes pour in for Justice Shahdeo|date=10 January 2018|access-date=14 November 2019|archive-date=2 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802104126/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2018/state-editions/tributes-pour-in-for-justice-shahdeo.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/remembering-justice-lpn-shahdeo-on-his-7th-death-anniversary.html|title=Remembering Justice LPN Shahdeo on his 7th death anniversary|date=10 January 2019|access-date=14 November 2019|archive-date=2 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200802124203/https://www.dailypioneer.com/2019/state-editions/remembering-justice-lpn-shahdeo-on-his-7th-death-anniversary.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1999 the Bharatiya Janata party promised to form a separate Vanachal state if they won the state election with a majority of votes.<ref name="jagran2018"/> After the last Assembly election in the state resulted in a hung assembly, [[RJD]]'s dependence on the Congress extended support on the precondition that RJD would not pose a hurdle to the passage of the [[Bihar Reorganisation Act, 2000|Bihar reorganisation Bill]]. Finally, with the support from both RJD and [[Indian National Congress|Congress]], the ruling coalition at the Centre led by the Bharatiya Janata Party which had made statehood its main poll plank in the region in successive polls earlier, cleared the Bihar reorganisation Bill in the monsoon session of the Parliament on 2 and 11 August in Loksabha and Rajyasabha. This paved the way for the creation of a separate Vanachal state comprising the [[Chota Nagpur Division]] and [[Santhal Pargana Division]] of South Bihar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.traveljharkhand.com/jharkhand-tourism/jharkhand-overview/jharkhand-history.html|title=History of Jharkhand, Jharkhand History|author=gigisoftsolutions|work=traveljharkhand.com|access-date=20 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419014954/http://www.traveljharkhand.com/jharkhand-tourism/jharkhand-overview/jharkhand-history.html|archive-date=19 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> [[National Democratic Alliance (India)|NDA]] formed the government with [[Babulal Marandi]] as chief minister.

===Jharkhand statehood===
The dynamics of resources and the politics of development still influence the socio-economic structures in Jharkhand, which was carved out of the relatively underdeveloped southern part of [[Bihar]]. According to the 1991 census, the state has a population of over 20 million out of which 28% is [[tribal]] while 12% of the people belong to [[Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes|scheduled castes]].

==Public Health==
Because of its mild climate, Jharkhand, particularly its capital Ranchi, has been a health resort. As far back as 1918, facilities were set up for treatment of [[mentally challenged]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cipranchi.nic.in/intro.htm |title=Introduction to Cip, Ranchi |quote= The British established this hospital on 17th May 1918 with the name of Ranchi European Lunatic Asylum. |access-date= 4 April 2005 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050404173734/http://cipranchi.nic.in/intro.htm |archive-date=4 April 2005}}</ref>

European Mental Hospital was established along with Indian Mental Hospital. Today they are called Central Institute of Psychiatry and Ranchi Institute of Neuro-psychiatry and Allied Sciences respectively.
In certain areas of Jharkhand, poverty and consequent malnutrition have given rise to diseases like [[tuberculosis]] (TB). In fact, TB has assumed [[epidemic]] proportions in certain areas of the state. For management and treatment of such TB, Itki TB Sanatorium, Ranchi, established in 1928 has been doing work as a premier institute for clinical and programmatic management of TB. The Itki TB Sanatorium is well equipped and accredited by the Indian government for quality assurance and Culture and Drug Sensitivity Testing for M.TB. It provides free of cost treatment for TB as well as drug-resistant TB. Likewise, in the field of treatment of cancer, Tata Main Hospital, Jamshedpur,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tatamemorialcentre.com/index.htm |title=Welcome to Tata Memorial Centre |publisher=Tatamemorialcentre.com |date=1 January 2004 |access-date=18 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218152943/http://www.tatamemorialcentre.com/index.htm |archive-date=18 February 2010 }}</ref> is rendering pioneering work. In the same way, Bokaro General Hospital equipped with modern facilities for the treatment of cancer and heart-related problems with the capacity of 1100 beds one of the largest in eastern India.

Although several public and private health facilities are available in the state, overall infrastructure for dispensing health related services require improvements. An exception is the Tata Motors Hospital which is an example of an ISO 14001 and 18001 certified hospital with DNB teaching facilities.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

Ranchi, the capital, has witnessed a sharp growth in the number of hospitals.
