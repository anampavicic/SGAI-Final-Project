'''Playa del Carmen''', known colloquially as 'Playa', is a [[Resort town|resort city]] located along the [[Caribbean Sea]] in the [[List of states of Mexico|state]] of [[Quintana Roo]], [[Mexico]]. It is part of the municipality of [[Solidaridad, Quintana Roo|Solidaridad]].

Playa del Carmen is a popular tourist destination in Mexico's [[Riviera Maya]] region. Its current growth rate is set at 7.5% per year.

The weather is hot year-round, with the summer and winter breaks being peak season for tourism.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Best times to visit Playa Del Carmen |url=https://travel.usnews.com/Playa_del_Carmen_Mexico/When_To_Visit/#:~:text=The%20best%20time%20to%20visit,generally%20dry%20and%20slightly%20warm.}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:PalmTreesWhiteSandPlayadelCarmen.jpg|thumb|Various palm trees on white sand beach, Playa del Carmen]]
Playa del Carmen is located within the Riviera Maya, which runs from south of [[Cancún]] to [[Tulum]] and the [[Sian Ka'an]] biosphere reserve. Playa is a stop for several cruise ships which dock at the nearby [[Calica]] quarry docks, about six miles (10&nbsp;km) south of the city. The [[Xcaret Eco Park]], a Mexican-themed "eco-archaeological park", is just south of the town in [[Xcaret]] (pronounced "ish-kar-et").

=== Climate ===

In October 2005, [[Hurricane Wilma]] passed directly over Playa del Carmen, remaining in the vicinity for two days and causing significant damage and a temporary drop in tourist arrivals. Most of the damage was relatively superficial and repaired within a few weeks of the storm. Hurricane Wilma arrived from the Caribbean Sea, passing over [[Cozumel]] before making landfall in Playa del Carmen. It then moved north along the Mexican coast, hitting [[Cancún]] especially hard.

Playa del Carmen has a [[Tropical savanna climate|tropical savannah climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Aw]]) with June to November receiving most of the precipitation. Summers are hot and year round with warm nights.
