Its area is 403&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>[http://cod.ibge.gov.br/2358V Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística] Government of Brazil.</ref> The municipality consists of Sertãozinho city and two districts: [[Cruz das Posses]] and [[Vila Garcia]]. Sertãozinho is 325&nbsp;km from [[São Paulo]] and 702&nbsp;km from [[Brasília]].

== History ==
In 1877, a settlement at Sertãozinho was founded on {{convert|148|acre|km2}} of land belonging to local farming estates. The land holders involved included [[Antonio Pedroso Malachi]], [[Antonio Jose Rodrigues]], Manoel Jacinto Bridge and Father Chico of Africa. Malachi, whose estate was called "Vila Nossa [[Our Lady of Aparacida|Senhora Aparecida]]", donated about {{convert|12|acre|m2}} of land which was divided amongst [[tenant farmer]]s. He built a chapel dedicated to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] (located at 21 de Abril Plaza).

On 10 March 1885, under law 31, the village was made a ''district of peace''. On 5 December 1896, the village was made a town and named ''Ali Sertãozinho'' by law 463. This was ratified on 21 April 1897. On 26 October 1906, under law 1018, the district was founded and ratified on 12 December 1906. The name of the municipality has changed over time, including, Capela de Sertãozinho, Engenho de Nossa Senhora Aparecida do Sertaozinho, Aparecida de Sertãozinho, and its current name, Sertãozinho. The first municipal magistrate was [[Renato Silveira da Motta]].

For many years, the main industry of the municipality was [[coffee]] production. However, the coffee fields became exhausted and the land was sold to ''colonos'' (former colonists) and investors who planted [[cotton]]. By 1920, Sertãozinho was one of the top ten cotton producing areas in Brazil.<ref>Font M. A.
