It is the gateway to the [[Amazon River]] with a busy [[Port of Belém|port]], [[Belém/Val-de-Cans International Airport|airport]], and [[Bus station|bus/coach station]]. Belém lies approximately 100 [[Kilometre|km]] (62.1 [[mile]]s) upriver from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], on the [[Pará River]], which is part of the greater Amazon River system, separated from the larger part of the [[Amazon Delta|Amazon delta]] by ''Ilha de Marajó'' ([[Marajó|Marajo Island]]). With an estimated population of 1,303,403 people — or 2,491,052, considering its [[metropolitan area]] — it is the [[List of largest cities in Brazil|12th most populous city]] in Brazil, as well as the [[Economy of Brazil|16th by economic relevance]]. It is the second largest in the [[North Region, Brazil|North Region]], second only to [[Manaus]], in the state of [[Amazonas (Brazilian state)|Amazonas]].

Founded in 1616 by the [[Kingdom of Portugal]], Belém was the first [[Colonial Brazil|European colony]] on the Amazon but did not become part of Brazil until 1775. The newer part of the city has modern buildings and [[skyscraper]]s. The colonial portion retains the charm of tree-filled [[Town square|squares]], [[Church (building)|churches]] and traditional blue tiles. The city has a rich history and architecture from colonial times. Recently, it witnessed a skyscraper boom.

Belém is also known as the ''Metropolis of the Brazilian Amazon region'' or the ''Cidade das Mangueiras'' (City of [[Mango]] Trees) due to the vast number of those trees found in the city. Brazilians often refer to the city as ''Belém do Pará'' ("Belém of Pará") rather than just ''Belém'', a reference to an earlier name for the city, ''Santa Maria de Belém do Grão Pará'' ("Saint Mary of Bethlehem of Great Pará"), and also to differentiate it from a number of other towns called Belém in Brazil, as well as the city of Bethlehem in the West Bank of Palestine. It is named after [[Santa Maria de Belém (Lisbon)|Santa Maria de Belém]] in Lisbon, also better known by its shortened name, [[Belém (Lisbon)|Belém]].

Belém is served by [[Belém International Airport]], which connects the city with the rest of Brazil and other cities in South America, North America (United States) and Europe (Lisbon). The city is also home to the [[Federal University of Pará]] and the [[Pará State University|State University]] of Pará.

==Etymology==

Belém is the Portuguese name for [[Bethlehem]], and has its origin in Hebrew which means "the house of bread". Initially the city was called "St. [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] of Bethlehem of Pará" ({{langx|pt|Santa Maria de Belém do Pará}}) or "Our Lady of Bethlehem of Greater Pará" ({{langx|pt|Nossa Senhora de Belém do Grão Pará}}),<ref>{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1003295058|title=Capitais brasileiras : dados históricos, demográficos, culturais e midiáticos|last1=Brönstrup|first1=Silvestrin Celsi | last2=Gisele| first2=Noll| last3=Nilda| first3=Jacks| publisher=Appris| date=2016| series=Ciências da comunicação|location=Curitiba, PR|isbn=9788547302917|oclc=1003295058}}</ref><ref name="cidadesibge">{{cite web|title=Brasil, Pará, Belém, História|url=https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/brasil/pa/belem/historico|series=Enciclopédia dos Municípios Brasileiros|publisher=Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística|access-date= 2018-03-08|date=2012}}</ref> eventually shortened to ''Belém do Pará'' (name given by [[Philip III of Spain]]),<ref>{{cite web|title=O mercado público em Belém: arquitetura e inserção urbanística |url=http://www.labcom.fau.usp.br/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/4_cincci/028-chaves.pdf|series=IV Colóquio Internacional sobre o comércio e cidade |date=2013-03-28 |last1=Chaves|first1=Celma |last2= Gonçalves|first2=Ana Paula Claudino |publisher=Faculdade de Arquitetura e Urbanismo da Universidade de São Paulo |access-date= 2018-03-08}}</ref> in reference to Christmas; the day when captain [[Francisco Caldeira Castelo Branco]] left from the city of [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]] in 1615 to conquer the lands of [[Pará]].<ref name="cidadesibge"/><ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.nucleodoconhecimento.com.br/historia/heranca-tupinamba |title=Das origens da Belém seiscentista e sua herança Tupinambá |date=2020-10-28 |access-date=2022-01-13 |journal=Revista Científica Multidisciplinar Núcleo do Conhecimento |number=10 |last=Pereira |first=Carlos Simões |volume=03 |pages=146–160 |doi=10.32749/nucleodoconhecimento.com.br/historia/heranca-tupinamba |s2cid=228931228 |language=pt-BR |issn=2448-0959|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://lhs.unb.br/atlas/Capitania_do_Gr%C3%A3o-Par%C3%A1|publisher=Atlas Digital da América Lusa|title=Capitania do Grão-Pará|access-date=2017-12-27}}</ref>

In 1615, Portuguese captain-general [[Francisco Caldeira Castelo Branco]] of the captaincy of [[Bahia]] commanded a military expedition sent by the [[Governorate General of Brazil|Governor General of Brazil]] to check the trading excursions of foreigners (French, Dutch, English) up the river (Amazon) from the Cabo do Norte in Grão Pará.

On January 12, 1616, he anchored in what is now known as [[Guajará Bay]], formed by the confluence of the Para and [[Guamá River|Guamá]] Rivers, called by the [[Tupinambá people|Tupinambás]], "Guaçu Paraná". Caldeira mistook the bay for the main channel, and thirty leagues (178&nbsp;km) upstream, he built a wooden fort, covered with straw, which he called "Presépio" (nativity scene), now known as "Forte do Castelo". The colony formed by the fort was given the name Feliz Lusitânia, "Fortunate Lusitania". It was the embryo of the future city of Belém. The fort failed to suppress Dutch and French trading, but did ward off colonization.

Feliz Lusitânia was later called Nossa Senhora de Belém do Grão Pará (Our Lady of Bethlehem of Grao-Para) and Santa Maria de Belém (St. Mary of Bethlehem). Belém was given city status in 1655 and was made capital of the State when Pará state was split off from [[Maranhão]] in 1772. The early decades of the 19th century were marked by political instability. Uprisings and internecine strife finally ended in 1836, after considerable loss of life.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.achetudoeregiao.com.br/PA/belem/historia.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090223043907/http://www.achetudoeregiao.com.br/PA/belem/historia.htm|url-status=dead|title=History of Belém|archive-date=February 23, 2009}}</ref>

The [[sugar trade]] in the Belém region was important up to the end of the 17th century. Thereafter the city's economic importance alternately rose and fell. Cattle ranching supplanted sugar until the 18th century, when cultivation of rice, cotton and coffee became profitable. With the settlement of [[southern Brazil]], where such crops could be produced more efficiently, Belém declined again. The city subsequently became the main exporting centre of the Amazon rubber industry, and by 1866 its position was further enhanced by the opening of the Amazon, [[Tocantins River|Tocantins]] and [[Tapajós]] rivers to navigation. The importance of Belém was then somewhat reduced by the development of the Port of [[Manaus]] upriver. The rubber era ended after the boom of 1910–12, but Belém continued to be the main commercial centre of northern Brazil and the [[entrepôt]] for the Amazon valley.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.brasilturismo.com/pa/belem/ |title=Rubber era in Belém |access-date=2013-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103152047/http://www.brasilturismo.com/pa/belem/ |archive-date=2013-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{Stack|||float=right}}

The municipality includes the islands of [[Mosqueiro]], fringed by 14 freshwater beaches, and Caratateua which receive a large number of visitors in summertime. In addition to these and also near Belém, is the island of Tatuoca which is the location of one of the seven [[geophysical]] stations in the world, and the only station in [[Latin America]].

===Climate===
Belém has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Af'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnpf.embrapa.br/pesquisa/efb/clima.htm|title=Clima|website=www.cnpf.embrapa.br|access-date=2019-03-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204095123/http://www.cnpf.embrapa.br/pesquisa/efb/clima.htm|archive-date=2019-02-04|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Mota|first1=Maria Aurora Santos da|last2=Tavares|first2=João Paulo Nardin|date=July 2012|title=Condições termodinâmicas de eventos de precipitação extrema em Belém-PA durante a estação chuvosa|journal=Revista Brasileira de Meteorologia|volume=27|issue=2|pages=207–218|doi=10.1590/S0102-77862012000200007|issn=0102-7786|doi-access=free}}</ref> more subject to the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] than the maritime [[trade wind]]s, and with no [[cyclone]]s, that is a true equatorial climate. In all 12 months of the year, the city on average sees more than 60&nbsp;mm of rainfall, so the city has no true [[dry season]] month. However, Belém features noticeably wetter and drier seasons. The wetter season spans from December through May, while the drier season covers the remaining six months of the year. Like many cities with a tropical rainforest climate, average temperatures vary little throughout the course of the year, generally hovering around 26.5 degrees Celsius. Due to its location in the Amazon, tropical rainforest is the natural vegetation in and around the city.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}

[[File:Catedral_Metropolitana_de_Belém.jpg|thumb|right|[[Our Lady of Grace Cathedral, Belém]], also known as the Sé Cathedral]]

===Círio de Nazaré===
On the second Sunday in October, Pará celebrates the largest religious event in Brazil: the [[procession]] of the Círio of Nazaré. This tradition started when a farmer and lumberman called Plácido José de Souza found an image of the Virgin and Child on the edge of the Murucutu creek, where the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Nazareth of Exile]] stands today. He decided to take the image home. However, the image would mysteriously go back to the place where it was initially found every time he took it home. So Plácido decided to build a small [[chapel]] on the edge of the creek. This episode was regarded as miraculous throughout the region. It attracted hundreds of believers to see the image and pay homage to it.
[[File:Festas de Nossa Senhora da Nazaré, Belém, Pará - Outubro de 2013 (56).jpg|thumb|left|Círio de Nazaré celebration.]]
[[File:Círio de Nazaré - Garnier Sampaio (15534517785).jpg|thumb|left|Círio de Nazaré in 2014.]]
Since then, the Círio has been celebrated as a long procession lasting around five hours, in which thousands of people follow the statue through the streets of Belém. The Círio festival is regarded as the "[[Christmas]] of the Amazon" because everyone is involved in the arrangements to receive the saint. In early September, minor celebrations take place as a spiritual preparation for the Círio, with thousands of images scattered all over the capital and neighboring cities.

In time it became necessary to incorporate new elements into the tradition due to the people's desire to honor their patron saint. On the Saturday morning prior to the Círio procession the statue is taken to the square of [[Ananindeua]], a nearby city, to begin a Road Pilgrimage to the [[Icoaraci]] pier for a [[Mass in the Catholic Church|Mass]]. The river pilgrimage then begins. It was created to honor the "water men" who regard the Virgin of Nazareth as their patron saint. There is a traditional ship contest to award the most originally decorated boat. When the Sacred Image leaves Icoaraci in a Navy [[Corvette]], it is followed by dozens of boats and ships through the waters of Guajará Bay to the pier of Belém, from where it is escorted all the way to the Gentil Bittencourt School. The subsequent candle-lit procession symbolizes the story of the discovery of the Saint and its return to where it was found. The procession follows the Carriage, to which a huge rope is tied, which is carried by the faithful until the procession arrives at the Sé Cathedral.

[[File:Belem-StoAlexandre1.jpg|thumb|right|Santo Alexandre Church.]]

During the procession, there is a [[fireworks]] show, sponsored by the [[Stevedore]]s' Union, marking the passage of the Saint until its arrival at the [[Cathedral]]. At daybreak of the next day, the faithful start to gather at the Old City, believing that this will bring them closer to the Virgin. At 7 o'clock, the [[archbishop]] conducts the image to the carriage as bells toll and fireworks explode. The main procession then goes through the streets of the city to the Architectonic Centre of Nazareth, known for its Sanctuary Square. As it arrives at the square, the image is removed from the carriage for the celebration of a Mass and then lifted so that everybody will be blessed by the patron saint of Pará.

The festivities last 15 days, with religious celebrations, like the Children's Círio, and its procession, held two Sundays after the Círio. The Re-Círio marks the end of the celebrations, with a shorter course back to the Gentil Bittencourt chapel.

===Convention and Fair Centre of the Amazon===
Built in a 23,000-square-metre area, the Hangar Convention and Fair Center of the Amazon has 12 rooms, ticket offices, baggage keeping, press room, and a [[food court]], distributed in two big buildings with a parking lot for 800 vehicles. Genuine Amazonian trees will soon be planted in the outdoor area. With Hangar, Belém joins the market for national conventions that take place in a different city each time, such as the [[Brazilian Computer Society]] Congress. National conventions had not been held in the Northern region previously.

Hangar, whose auditorium has room for 2,160 participants, has some of the best technologies available in the world and is the most modern and functional space for events in the country. According to the Brazilian Association of Convention and Fair Centers (ABRACCEF), there are 17,500 events happening on average throughout the 53 main convention and exhibition centres of Brazil. These activities bring together approximately 28 million participants. Belém has great potential for this type of tourism.

===Architecture===
[[File:Belem-TeatroPaz1.jpg|thumb|[[Theatro da Paz]].]]
In many ways, Belém's [[colonial architecture]] reflects the seventeenth-century architecture of [[Lisbon]] in Portugal which served as the inspiration for the main housing projects of the time, with the frequent use of tile-hung façades. [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical architecture]] is also present in buildings such as the [[Theatro da Paz]], built in 1874. Many of the buildings at the end of the nineteenth century and early twentieth century also echo [[French architecture]].

The local [[Amerindian]] culture makes use of local ingredients to create the colors and flavors of its cuisine. One such ingredient, a fruit named "Cupuaçu", comes from the Cupuaçu tree, found in the Amazonian woods. Cupuaçu is easily identified by its unique smell and sour taste. Its pulp is also extracted to make juices, candies, jellies, liquors, and ice cream. [[Açaí palm|Açaí]] is a palm tree with a long, thin stem. The palm fruits from this tree are purple in color with a earthy and fruity taste. Long prized by the local population, it recently it has also reached the national menu.
