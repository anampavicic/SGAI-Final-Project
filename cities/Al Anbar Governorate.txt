'''Al Anbar Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|محافظة الأنبار}}; ''muḥāfaẓat al-’Anbār''), or '''Anbar Province''', is the largest [[Governorates of Iraq|governorate]] in [[Iraq]] by area. Encompassing much of the country's western territory, it shares borders with [[Syria]], [[Jordan]], and [[Saudi Arabia]]. The population is mostly [[Sunni]] [[Arabs]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Anbar |url=https://euaa.europa.eu/country-guidance-iraq-2021/anbar |access-date=2024-05-09 |website=European Union Agency for Asylum |language=en}}</ref> The provincial capital is [[Ramadi]]; other important cities include [[Fallujah]], [[Al-Qa'im (town)|Al-Qa'im]] and [[Haditha]].

The governorate was known as Ramadi up to 1976 when it was renamed Al Anbar Province, and it was known as ''Dulaim'' before 1962. A large majority of the inhabitants of the province are Arab [[Sunni]] Muslims and most belong to the [[Dulaim]] tribe.

In early 2014, the [[Islamic State]], with the assistance of some local Sunni militias, launched [[Anbar campaign (2013-14)|a successful campaign]] to seize control of the province from the Iraqi government. Numerous offensive actions were undertaken by the Iraqi government, with the assistance of local Sunni tribes to remove IS's occupation of the province, especially in the [[Anbar campaign (2015–16)]], the [[Western Anbar offensive (September 2017)]] and the [[2017 Western Iraq campaign]]. The area was effectively recaptured by the end of 2017 and has been at peace since then.

==Etymology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
[[File:Ramadi Aerial Picture - April 2008.jpeg|thumb|Aerial view of the Euphrates River in [[Ramadi]], the capital of Anbar governorate.]]
The name of the governorate in [[Persian language]] means "warehouse" or "silo". This was the last stop/warehouses on the old [[Silk Road]] toward Syria. The name is pre-Islamic. The name of the governorate is taken over from a historic city that was originally located on its territory and whose ruins can still be seen 5&nbsp;km northwest of Fallujah near the city of [[Saqlawiyah]] today. This city of Anbār or [[Peroz-Shapur]] was founded in the 3rd century by the [[Muntherids]] and was, before the Arab conquest in 634, the second-largest city of Iraq. It was abandoned after the [[Mongol invasion of Iraq|Mongol invasion]] in the 14th century. A pseudo-authentication is offered by proposing that the name is Arabic and stands for "[[Granary|granaries]]" in [[Arabic]], further proposing the word Anbar (أنبار) to be the plural of Nbr (نبر) which meaning "[[grain]]s". The name was already in use in Pre-Islamic times during the [[Sasanian]] rule over Iraq, long before Arabic replaced [[Aramaic]] as the main language of Iraq.

Dulaim is the old name of the governorate due to the [[Dulaim]] tribe inhabiting the region. It was also called Liwa Al-Dulaim ({{lang|ar|لواء الدليم}}) in the Ottoman period and Sanjak Al-Dulaim in the seventeenth century.

== History ==

=== Al Dulaim Tribe ===
Al Anbar was known as the Dulaim Province to the concentration of Dulaim Tribe in this region and before them, it was informally named as Sanjak Al Dulaim. During the [[Ottoman Iraq|Ottoman period]], the province of Dulaim was created, today known as '''Al Anbar Governorate'''. In 1706, Sheikh Itha bin Hamad was appointed as its ruler. But it came into its current form in the 1930s when Iraq was a monarchy.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

King [[Faisal I of Iraq]] visited the province on July 31, 1921. He was received by Sheikh Ali Al Sulaimani, the ruler of the province, and 6,000 members of the tribe.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}

=== Caliphate period ===
{{see|Rashidun Caliphate|Umayyad Caliphate|Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid dynasty|Siege of Baghdad (1258)}}
During the reign of [[Rashidun]] Caliph [[Abu bakr]] the conquest of Anbar was launched his successors conquered whole [[Middle East]]. 

During the Abbasid era in the reign of Caliph [[al-Saffah|Abu al-Abbas Abdallah al-Saffah]] in 134 AH, the second capital of the [[Abbasid]] Caliphate after [[Kufa]] to [[Baghdad]] where he built his palace in 145 AH. He built the road through the Euphrates River and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Persian Gulf]], so the armies entering and leaving Iraq are passing through this region.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

== Geography ==
Anbar is one of the driest governorates in Iraq's western desert climate. Some of Al Anbar is part of the [[Syrian Desert]], characterized by steppe and desert terrain. Most of Al Anbar is considered as a topographical continuation of the [[Arabian Peninsula]] plateau region. It has some small hills and a number of [[wadi]]s, including [[Wadi Hauran]]. Given a decline in land preservation and a lack of natural vegetation, the land is often exposed to the elements and prone to severe erosion.

Among the most important agricultural crops are [[potatoes]], which are harvested in spring and fall. [[Wheat]], [[barley]] and maize (corn) are also commonly grown in the governorate. Al Anbar is also known for the production of [[phosphate]]s and [[fertilizer]]. It is also rich in mineral such as [[sulphur]], [[gold]] and [[Oil reserves|oil]]. However, Anbar has not been extensively explored for oil.

=== Climate ===
The average rainfall in Al Anbar is 115 millimeters (4.53 in) per year. Summer temperatures may reach as high as 52°C (125°F) and may fall as low as 0°C (32°F) in the winter. The [[Euphrates]] River is the main water source for residents of the governorate. The river flows southeasterly through seven of Al Anbar's districts:
* [[Al-Qa'im District]]
* [[Anah District]]
* [[Haditha District]]
* [[Hit District]]
* [[Rawah District]]
* [[Ramadi District]]
* [[Fallujah District]]
* [[Ar-Rutba District]]

In the 1920s, the governorate had a population of 250,000, as did [[Baghdad]], out of a total population of 2&nbsp;million in Iraq. Today there are 9&nbsp;million people living in Baghdad, among them a million Anbari people in the city and suburbs; their origins are the people of the Al-Anbar tribes that have moved to Baghdad during the past 500 years and their recent migrations there during the 1920s and 1930s.

Half of the residents in Anbar are living on the banks of the [[Euphrates River]] outside cities and the towns, there were between 1.9&nbsp;million and 2&nbsp;million inhabitants in the districts of Al Anbar.<ref>{{cite book |last=Parfit |first=Joseph T.|title=Marvellous Mesopotamia, The World's Wonderland|year=1920 |url=https://archive.org/details/marvellousmesopo00parfrich|publisher=S.

According to a 2003 estimate by the NGO Coordination Committee in Iraq, the population was 1,230,140.

It is estimated that around 90 percent of Anbar's inhabitants are adherents of the Sunni branch of Islam. The remaining ten percent are either [[Shia]]s or other minorities.<ref>{{cite web|title=Irakische Streitkräfte starten Rückeroberung Ramadis|url=http://www.dw.de/irakische-streitkr%C3%A4fte-starten-r%C3%BCckeroberung-ramadis/a-18477575|work=Deutsche Welle|access-date=2015-05-26}}</ref>

==Anbar during U.S. occupation==

[[File:Abandoned Iraqi FT-7 in front of the Al Asad ATC Tower.jpg|thumb|Abandoned Iraqi Air Force [[Chengdu J-7|J-7]] aircraft in front of the [[Al Asad Airbase]] ATC Tower]]
The geographic challenge of the Anbar Governorate is demonstrated by two contrasting facts: while it is Iraq's largest governorate, it also is the most sparsely populated. For a governorate that is approximately the size of [[Bangladesh]], it is home to fewer than 1.8&nbsp;million Iraqis. Most of the population lives in the major cities, like Ramadi and Fallujah, and almost everyone else lives within a short distance of the Euphrates River that snakes from Baghdad to the Syrian border near Al-Qa'im.<ref name="marines2007">{{cite web|url=http://www.marines.mil/unit/marforres/Documents/GWOT%202004-2007.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-07-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915231030/http://www.marines.mil/unit/marforres/Documents/GWOT%202004-2007.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-15 }}</ref> Its strategic challenge was demonstrated, in part, by casualty statistics. During the first four years of Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), the Anbar Province was the deadliest province for American service members, claiming approximately one-third of American fatalities.<ref name="marines2007" />

The Anbar Province was the Sunni stronghold that had long provided Saddam Hussein with the support he needed to remain in power.<ref name="marines2007" /> During the early years of Operation Iraqi Freedom, it provided an important base for Al Qaeda and insurgent operations.<ref name="marines2007" /> Part of its significance came from the fact that the Western Euphrates River Valley served as an important infiltration route for foreign fighters headed to Iraq's heartland.<ref name="marines2007" /> ''The New York Times'' compared this region to the [[Vietnam War]]'s [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]], as foreign fighters and insurgents used the river valley to move in relative safety from the Syrian border to cities like Baghdad, Ramadi and Fallujah.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}
[[File:Three marines patrol along the Euphrates River during Operation Iron Fist.jpg|thumb|220x220px|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] patrol along the [[Euphrates|Euphrates River]] in Anbar Province]]
The contrast between the fertile Euphrates River Valley and the rest of the province is striking. Along the Euphrates, groves of fruits and vegetables and acre after acre of date palms are surrounded by a lushness that paints the area a vivid green. Just a few miles from the Euphrates, however, the barren landscape turns brown. With the exception of an occasional Bedouin, the desert is essentially empty. Whether traveling by aircraft, vehicle, or on foot, the Anbar Governorate is vast. During a time when [[land mine|mining]] roads became a strategy of choice for insurgents, the need to patrol and travel throughout the province became one of the Marine Corps' greatest challenges. The threat of insurgent activity, when combined with the challenges that long-distance travel, choking dust, and stifling heat created, made the Anbar Province a difficult area of operation.<ref name="marines2007" />
