Prior to [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] from the [[British Raj|British]], Himachal comprised the hilly regions of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]] of [[British India]]. After independence, many of the hilly territories were organised as the Chief Commissioner's province of Himachal Pradesh, which later became a Union Territory. In 1966, hilly areas of the neighbouring [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] state were merged into Himachal and it was ultimately granted full statehood in 1971.

Himachal Pradesh is spread across valleys with many perennial rivers flowing through them. [[Agriculture]], horticulture, hydropower, and tourism are important constituents of the state's economy.

Himachal Pradesh is divided into 12 districts.

==Etymology==
The name of the state is a reference to its setting: Himachal means "snowy slopes" (Sanskrit: ''hima'', meaning "snow"; ''acala/achala meaning'' "slopes", or "land", or "abode"). Himachal Pradesh (ɦɪˈmaːtʃəl pɾəˈdeːʃ; literally "snow-laden province"). Himachal refers to being in the "''aanchal''" of the Himalayas hence, sheltered by the Himalayas or by the snow. It means "the land in the lap of snowy Himalayas". [[Pradesh]] means "state". Himachal was referenced by Diwakar Datt Sharma, a [[Sanskrit]] scholar, after independence, when "Jan Gan Man" was revealed publicly by Pt. Nehru from Gurudev [[Tagore]]'s diary. The word was added in the national anthem of India "Jan Gan Man" by Gurudev [[Rabindranath Tagore]] when he was writing and composing it. Later after independence of India, Punjab province was divided and the name was given officially to the mountain state as [[Himachal Pradesh]].<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Himachal Pradesh turns 45 today: Some interesting facts about the state |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-%26-current-affairs/story/himchal-pradesh-305386-2016-01-25 |access-date=3 November 2023 |magazine=India Today |date=25 January 2016 |archive-date=27 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230927101426/https://www.indiatoday.in/education-today/gk-%26-current-affairs/story/himchal-pradesh-305386-2016-01-25 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=हिमाचल प्रदेश का नामकरण और आचार्य दिवाकर दत्त शर्मा |url=http://himalayilog.com/2022/04/11/%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%B2-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE-%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A3-%E0%A4%94/ |access-date=3 November 2023 |work=Himalayilog.com |date=11 April 2022 |archive-date=5 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231005104253/http://himalayilog.com/2022/04/11/%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%B2-%E0%A4%AA%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B6-%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%BE-%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%95%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%A3-%E0%A4%94/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the [[Vedic period]], several small republics known as ''Janapada'' existed which were later conquered by the [[Gupta Empire]]. After a brief period of supremacy by King [[Harshavardhana]], the region was divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some [[Rajput]] principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by [[Delhi Sultanate]] several times.<ref name="nichist" /> [[Mahmud Ghaznavi]] conquered [[Kangra, Himachal Pradesh|Kangra]] at the beginning of the 11th century.

[[File:Rajput states in Himachal Pradesh.svg|left|thumb|230px|A map of the major Rajput kingdoms in Himachal Pradesh]]

The [[Kingdom of Gorkha]] conquered many kingdoms and came to power in [[Nepal]] in 1768.<ref name=nichist /> They consolidated their military power and began to expand their territory.<ref name=nichist /> Gradually, the [[Kingdom of Nepal]] annexed [[Sirmaur district|Sirmour]] and [[Shimla]]. Under the leadership of [[Amar Singh Thapa]], the [[Nepali Army|Nepali army]] laid siege to [[Kangra district|Kangra]]. They managed to defeat [[Sansar Chand]] [[Katoch]], the ruler of Kangra, in 1806 with the help of many provincial chiefs. However, the Nepali army could not capture Kangra fort which came under [[Maharaja Ranjit Singh]] in 1809. After the defeat, they expanded towards the south of the state. However, Raja Ram Singh, Raja of Siba State, captured the fort of Siba from the remnants of [[Lahore]] Darbar in Samvat 1846,<ref name=nichist /> during the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]].

They came into direct conflict with the British along the ''[[tarai]]'' belt, after which the British expelled them from the provinces of the [[Satluj]].<ref name=nichist /> The British gradually emerged as the paramount power in the region.<ref name=nichist /> In the revolt of 1857, or first [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Indian war of independence]], arising from several grievances against the British,<ref name=nichist /> the people of the hill states were not as politically active as were those in other parts of the country.<ref name=nichist /> They and their rulers, except Bushahr, remained more or less inactive.<ref name=nichist /> Some, including the rulers of [[Chamba, Himachal Pradesh|Chamba]], [[Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh|Bilaspur]], Bhagal and Dhami, rendered help to the British government during the revolt.

The British territories came under the British Crown after [[Queen Victoria]]'s proclamation of 1858. The states of [[Chamba State|Chamba]], [[Mandi, Himachal Pradesh, India|Mandi]] and Bilaspur made good progress in many fields during the British rule.<ref name=nichist /> During World War I, virtually all rulers of the hill states remained loyal and contributed to the British war effort, both in the form of men and materials.

=== Partition and post-independence ===
After independence, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Himachal Pradesh was organised on 15 April 1948 as a result of the integration of 30 petty princely states (including feudal princes and ''zaildars'') in the promontories of the western [[Himalayas]]. These were known as the Simla Hills States and four [[Punjab]] southern hill states under the Himachal Pradesh (Administration) Order, 1948 under Sections 3 and 4 of the Extra-Provincial Jurisdiction Act, 1947 (later renamed as the Foreign Jurisdiction Act, 1947 vide A.O. of 1950). The State of Bilaspur was merged into Himachal Pradesh on 1 July 1954 by the Himachal Pradesh and Bilaspur (New State) Act, 1954.{{sfn|Verma|1995|pp = 239-254, ''Territorial Gains''}}

Himachal became a Part 'C' state on 26 January 1950 when the [[Constitution of India]] came into effect and the Lieutenant Governor was appointed. The Legislative Assembly was elected in 1952. Himachal Pradesh became a [[union territory]] on 1 November 1956.<ref name=nichist /> Some areas of the Punjab State, namely, Simla, Kangra, Kullu and Lahul and Spiti Districts, Lohara, Amb and Una Kanungo circles, some areas of Santokhgarh Kanungo circle and some other specified area of Una Tehsil of [[Hoshiarpur District]], as well as Kandaghat and Nalagarh Tehsils of erstwhile [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union|PEPSU State]], besides some parts of Dhar Kalan Kanungo circle of Pathankot District—were merged with Himachal Pradesh on 1 November 1966 on the enactment by Parliament of the [[Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966]].{{sfn|Verma|1995|pp = 239-254, ''Territorial Gains''}} On 18 December 1970, the State of Himachal Pradesh Act was passed by Parliament, and the new state came into being on 25 January 1971. Himachal became the 18th state of the Indian Union with [[Yashwant Singh Parmar|Dr. Yashwant Singh Parmar]] as its first chief minister.<ref name=nichist />

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Himachal Pradesh}}

Himachal is in the western [[Himalayas]] situated between 30°22′N and 33°12′N latitude and 75°47′E and 79°04′E longitude. Covering an area of {{convert|55673|km2|mi2}},<ref name=area /> it is a mountainous state. The [[Zanskar range]] runs in the northeastern part of the state and the great Himalayan range run through the eastern and northern parts, while the [[Dhauladhar]] and the [[Pir Panjal range]]s of the lesser Himalayas, and their valleys, form much of the core regions. The outer Himalayas, or the [[Shiwalik hills|Shiwalik range]], form southern and western Himachal Pradesh.

Himachal Pradesh is one of the states that lies in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR), one of the richest reservoirs of biological diversity in the world. As of 2002, the IHR is undergoing large scale irrational extraction of wild, medicinal herbs, thus endangering many of its high-value gene stock. To address this, a workshop on 'Endangered Medicinal Plant Species in Himachal Pradesh' was held in 2002 and the conference was attended by forty experts from diverse disciplines.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Aldam |first=C |date=10 October 2002 |title=Endangered medicinal plant species in Himachal Pradesh |journal=Current Science Association |volume=83 |page=797}}</ref>

The [[Legislative Assembly of Himachal Pradesh]] has no pre-constitution history. The State itself is a post-independence creation. It came into being as a centrally administered territory on 15 April 1948 from the integration of thirty erstwhile princely states.<ref name="gov1">{{cite web |url=http://legislativebodiesinindia.gov.in/States/Himachal/himachal_w.htm |title=Himachal Pradesh (gov) Introduction |access-date=3 May 2007 |work=National informatics center |publisher=Computer Centre, Lok Sabha Secretariat |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927154150/http://legislativebodiesinindia.gov.in/States/Himachal/himachal_w.htm |archive-date=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Himachal Pradesh is governed through a [[parliamentary system]] of [[representative democracy]], a feature the state shares with other Indian states. [[Universal suffrage]] is granted to residents. The legislature consists of elected members and special office bearers such as the Speaker and the Deputy Speaker who are elected by the members. Assembly meetings are presided over by the Speaker or the Deputy Speaker in the Speaker's absence. The [[judiciary]] is composed of the [[Himachal Pradesh High Court]] and a system of lower courts.

[[executive (government)|Executive authority]] is vested in the Council of Ministers headed by the [[Chief Minister of Himachal Pradesh|Chief Minister]], although the titular head of government is the [[Governors of Himachal Pradesh|Governor]]. The governor is the [[head of state]] appointed by the [[President of India]]. The leader of the party or coalition with a majority in the Legislative Assembly is appointed as the Chief Minister by the governor, and the Council of Ministers are appointed by the governor on the advice of the Chief Minister. The Council of Ministers reports to the Legislative Assembly. The Assembly is [[unicameral]] with 68 [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|Members of the Legislative Assembly]] (MLA).<ref name="295mla">{{cite web |url=http://legislativebodiesinindia.gov.in/ |title=Legislative Assembly | access-date = 28 October 2006 |work=Legislative Bodies in India |publisher=National Informatics Centre | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061018181407/http://legislativebodiesinindia.gov.in/ | archive-date = 18 October 2006 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Terms of office run for five years, unless the Assembly is dissolved prior to the completion of the term. Auxiliary authorities known as ''[[Panchayati raj in India|panchayat]]s'', for which local body elections are regularly held, govern local affairs.

In the assembly elections held in November 2022, the [[Indian National Congress]] secured an absolute majority, winning 40 of the 68 seats while the [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] won only 25 of the 68 seats. [[Sukhvinder Singh Sukhu]] was sworn in as Himachal Pradesh's 15th Chief Minister in Shimla on 11 December 2022. [[Mukesh Agnihotri]] was sworn in as his deputy the same day.
