It is also one of the constituent parts of the [[Vaal Triangle]] region and was formerly situated in the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal province]]. The name ''Vereeniging'' is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word meaning "association", although the spelling has since changed to ''vereniging'', with a single ''e''.

== Geographical information ==
{{Unsourced|section|date=August 2023}}
Vereeniging is situated in the southern part of Gauteng Province, and forms the southern portion of the [[Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeniging|Pretoria-Witwatersrand-Vereeninging]] (PWV) conurbation, and its neighbors are [[Vanderbijlpark]] (to the west), [[Three Rivers Proper|Three Rivers]] (east), [[Meyerton, Gauteng|Meyerton]] (north) and [[Sasolburg]] (south). The city is currently one of the most important industrial manufacturing centres in South Africa, with its chief products being iron, steel, pipes, bricks, tiles and processed lime.

The predominant language in Vereeniging is [[English language|English]] followed closely by [[Sesotho]] language and [[Afrikaans]].

== History ==
[[File:R Aspeling Blockhouse Vereeniging.jpg|thumbnail|The [[blockhouse]] in Vereeniging built by the British during the [[Second Boer War]].]]
In 1879, George William Stow was commissioned by the [[Orange Free State]] government to look for coal deposits in the Bethlehem district<ref name="Leyds">{{cite book | title=A History of Johannesburg: The Early Years | publisher=Nasional Boekhandel | author=Leyds, Gerald Anton | year=1964 | pages=318}}</ref>{{rp|17}} With no deposits found he moved northwards to ''Maccauvlei'' on the Vaal River and then crossed the river to the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] side. On the farm ''Leeuwkuil'', he found a [[coal]] deposit twelve feet thick.<ref name=Leyds/>{{rp|17}} But the Orange Free State government believed that the deposit was too far away and there was a lack of transport so turned down the idea of mining there.<ref name=Leyds/>{{rp|17}} 

Stow settled in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]] to find a job, where he met [[Samuel Marks]]. After hearing Stow's story, Marks saw an opportunity to use the coal for energy generation at the Kimberley diamond fields.<ref name=Leyds/>{{rp|17}} Marks formed ''De Zuid Afrikaanshe en Oranje Vrystaatsche Kolen and Mineralen Vereeniging'' (The South African and Orange Free State Coal and Mineral Association) and sent Stow to purchase the farms where the coal was found.<ref name=Leyds/>{{rp|17}} On 25 November 1880 he purchased the 12,000 acre farm ''Leeuwkuil'' for £5,000.<ref name=Leyds/>{{rp|18}} Marks' agent J.G. Fraser also purchased the 6,000 acre ''Klipplaatdrift'' farm from Karl August Pistorius in October 1881 for £15,500. This was opposite the farm ''Maccauvlei''.<ref name=Leyds/>{{rp|18}} 

From 1881, coal was taken by ox-wagon to Kimberley, and by 1882 there was so much development around the mining area that a village was surveyed on the two former farms. The ''[[Volksraad of the South African Republic|Volksraad]]'' agreed to name it Vereeniging, a shortened version of the company's name.<ref name=Leyds/>{{rp|18}}

===Second Boer War===
The [[Treaty of Vereeniging]] ending the [[Second Boer War]] (1899–1902) was negotiated here by delegates of the [[South African Republic]], the [[Orange Free State]], and the [[British Empire]]. During the conflict, a [[Second Boer War concentration camps|concentration camp]] was set up in the area by the British in September 1900, and by October 1901 it housed 185 men, 330 women, and 452 children. Conditions at the camp were very poor: drinking water was brought by cart from a fountain (there was no direct water supply although it was situated next to the Vaal River) and there were only 24 latrines. Most inmates lived in bell-tents but there was a dispensary and a school.

The concentration camp was situated where the Mittal Steel plant (Vaal Works) is situated. Today, the Maccauvlei Golf Course is on the opposite side of the Vaal River to where the concentration camp was, and a Garden of Remembrance is situated at Maccauvlei. All the British soldiers killed in and around Vereeniging during the war were re-buried on this site.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

=== Flooding 2011 ===
In December 2010 and January 2011 the southern part of [[Gauteng]] and Mpumulanga experienced a higher than normal rainfall. This resulted in the need to release more water from the nearby [[Vaal dam]].  As a consequence, parts of Vereeniging, Three Rivers and the rest of the towns downstream were flooded.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2011-06-02 |title=Southern Africa: Floods - Jan 2011 {{!}} ReliefWeb |url=https://reliefweb.int/disaster/fl-2011-000007-zaf |access-date=2024-04-24 |website=reliefweb.int |language=en}}</ref>

==Coat of arms==
[[File:Vereeniging.jpg|thumb|150px|Vereeniging coat of arms (1955)]]
Vereeniging established a municipality in 1912.  By 1931, the town council had assumed an [http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Category:UTC_South_African_town_arms emblem] depicting bridge across a river, and two clasped hands.

The town council obtained a coat of arms from the [[College of Arms]] in October 1955, registered it with the Transvaal Provincial Administration in October 1957<ref name=og>Transvaal ''Official Gazette'' 2664 (23 October 1957).</ref> and with the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] in June 1987.<ref name=boh>[http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za/sm300cv/smws/sm300dl National Archives of South Africa : Data of the Bureau of Heraldry]</ref>

The arms were : ''Sable, on a fess wavy Or a barrulet wavy Tenne, the fess between in chief a thunderbolt between two picks, Or, and in base a steel pipe palewise proper between two cogwheels, also Or''.  In layman's terms, the design is a black shield displaying, from top to bottom, a golden heraldic thunderbolt between two picks, a wavy orange stripe edged in gold, and an upright golden pipe between two cogwheels.

The crest was a dove of peace perched on two clasped hands;  the supporters were a lion and a zebra standing on a grassy base strewn with veld flowers;  and the motto was ''Per pacem ad industriam''.
