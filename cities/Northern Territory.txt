The archaeological history of the Northern Territory may have begun more than 60,000 years ago when [[human]]s first settled this region of the [[Sahul Shelf|Sahul]] Continent. From at least the 18th century, [[Makassar people|Makassan]] traders began [[Makassan contact with Australia|a relationship with the indigenous people]] of the Northern Territory around the trading of [[Sea cucumber (food)|trepang]].

The economy is based largely on mining and petroleum, which during 2018–2019 contributed 23% of the [[gross state product]], or $5.68 billion, accounting for 92.4% of exports.<ref>{{cite web |title=Industries |url=https://nteconomy.nt.gov.au/industry-analysis/mining-and-manufacturing |website=Northern Territory Economy |publisher=Department of Treasury and Finance, Northern Territory Government |access-date=31 August 2020 |date=2019 |archive-date=19 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230419164342/https://nteconomy.nt.gov.au/industry-analysis/mining-and-manufacturing |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=International trade |url=https://nteconomy.nt.gov.au/international-trade#exports |website=Northern Territory Economy |publisher=Department of Treasury and Finance, Northern Territory Government |access-date=31 August 2020 |date=2019 |archive-date=18 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230418210853/https://nteconomy.nt.gov.au/international-trade#exports |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Colonial administration===
With the coming of the British, there were four early attempts to settle the harsh environment of the northern coast, of which three failed in starvation and despair. The land now occupied by the Northern Territory was part of colonial [[New South Wales]] from 1825 to 1863, except for a brief time from February to December 1846, when it was part of the short-lived colony of [[North Australia]]. The Northern Territory was part of South Australia from 1863 to 1911 and, under their administration the [[Australian Overland Telegraph Line|Overland Telegraph Line]] was constructed between 1870 and 1872.<ref>{{Cite web |last=corporateName=National Museum of Australia; address=Lawson Crescent |first=Acton Peninsula |title=National Museum of Australia – Overland telegraph |url=https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/overland-telegraph |access-date=2024-03-11 |publisher=National Museum of Australia|archive-date=30 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330000552/https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/overland-telegraph |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Federal territory===
On 1 January 1911, a decade after [[Federation of Australia|Federation]], the Northern Territory was separated from South Australia, alongside the [[Australian Capital Territory]] from NSW, and transferred to federal control.

Either we must accomplish the peopling of the northern territory or submit to its transfer to some other nation."''<ref>{{cite book|last=Walker|first=David|title=Anxious Nation: Australia and the Rise of Asia, 1850–1939|year=1999|publisher=[[University of Queensland Press]]|isbn=978-0702231315|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=spS6AAAAIAAJ}}</ref>

====Division into North Australia and Central Australia====
For a brief time between 1927 and 1931 the Northern Territory was divided into [[North Australia (territory)|North Australia]] and [[Central Australia (territory)|Central Australia]] at the [[20th parallel of South latitude]]. Soon after this time, parts of the Northern Territory were considered in the [[Kimberley Plan]] as a possible site for the establishment of a [[Jewish Homeland]], understandably considered the "[[promised Land|Unpromised Land]]".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article18097828 |title=Wasted Years |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |issue=34,577 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=16 October 1948 |access-date=20 July 2019 |page=6 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article43802260 |title=Immigration Scheme That Failed |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]] |volume=91 |issue=28178 |location=South Australia |date=29 January 1949 |access-date=20 July 2019 |page=8 |via=National Library of Australia}}</ref>

During the early 20th century, the southern part of the Territory was considered the "last frontier" of Australian settlement, where 'sympathetic whites' hoped that Aboriginal traditions would continue to be practised.<ref name="O'Brien">{{cite journal |date=2015 |title=Hunger and the humanitarian frontier |last=O'Brien |first=Anne |url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p332783/html/article05.xhtml?referer=1790&page=11 |journal=Aboriginal History |publisher=Aboriginal History Inc.

This was exacerbated by a drought between 1925 and 1929 that led to the deaths of 85 per cent of the children at the [[Hermannsburg, Northern Territory|Hermannsburg Mission]] in Central Australia. In the meantime, white attitudes towards Aboriginal people were paternalistic, torn between the desire to help them in times of hunger and the fear of "pauperizing" them and reducing their incentives to work.<ref name="O'Brien"/> 

In the 1928 [[Coniston massacre]], punitive expeditions were carried out by white colonists led by [[Northern Territory Police]] constable [[William George Murray]] in response to the murder of a [[dingo]] hunter, resulting in the deaths of dozens to hundreds of people of the [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]], [[Anmatyerre]], and [[Kaytetye people|Kaytetye]] groups.<ref name="Bradley">{{cite book |last1=Bradley |first1=Michael |title=Coniston |date=2019 |publisher=UWA Press |location=Perth|isbn=9781760801045}}</ref> This was one of many massacres of Aboriginal people in the region.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |title=Some Known Frontier Conflicts in the Northern Territory |url=https://australianfrontierconflicts.com.au/timelines/some-known-frontier-conflicts-in-the-northern-territory/ |access-date=2024-09-17 |website=Australian Frontier Conflicts |language=en-AU}}</ref> For more information see: [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians]].

====Post-World War II====
During World War II, most of the Top End was placed under military government. This is the only time since Federation that part of an Australian state or territory has been under military control. After the war, control for the entire area was handed back to the Commonwealth. The [[Bombing of Darwin]] occurred on 19 February 1942. It was the largest single attack ever mounted by a foreign power on Australia. Evidence of Darwin's World War II history is found at a variety of preserved sites in and around the city, including ammunition bunkers, airstrips, oil tunnels and museums. The port was damaged in the 1942 Japanese air raids. It was subsequently restored.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thiem |first1=David |title=Semaphore: 75 Years After the Bombing of Darwin a Story of Reconciliation Hope and Peace |url=https://seapower.navy.gov.au/media-room/publications/semaphore-04-17 |website=Semaphore |publisher=Royal Australian Navy |access-date=14 June 2024}}</ref>

In the late 1960s improved roads in adjoining States linking with the territory, port delays and rapid economic development led to uncertainty in port and regional infrastructure development. As a result of the Commission of Enquiry established by the Administrator,<ref>[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Records/a590549]{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}</ref> port working arrangements were changed, berth investment deferred and a port masterplan prepared.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2794315|title=Darwin and Northern Territory freight transport study|editor-last=Australia|date=30 April 1977|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service|isbn=9780642033512|access-date=30 April 2019|via=National Library of Australia (new catalog)|archive-date=30 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190430152242/https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2794315|url-status=live}}</ref> Extension of rail transport was then not considered because of low freight volumes.

[[Indigenous Australians]] had struggled for rights to fair wages and land. An important event in this struggle was the [[Gurindji strike|strike and walk off]] by the [[Gurindji people]] at [[Kalkaringi|Wave Hill Cattle Station]] in 1966. The [[Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights]] (NTCAR) supported the strikers and provided publicity.<ref name=ntcar>{{cite web | title=Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights | publisher=National Museum of Australia | date=26 November 2018 | url=https://www.nma.gov.au/explore/features/indigenous-rights/organisations/expansion-folder/northern-territory-council-aboriginal-rights#! | access-date=30 November 2020 | archive-date=14 May 2021 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210514125342/https://www.nma.gov.au/explore/features/indigenous-rights/organisations/expansion-folder/northern-territory-council-aboriginal-rights#! | url-status=dead }}</ref> The Federal government of [[Gough Whitlam#Prime Minister|Gough Whitlam]] set up [[Aboriginal Land Rights Commission|the Woodward Royal Commission]] in February 1973, to enquire into how land rights might be achieved in the Northern Territory. [[Philip Woodward (judge)|Justice Woodward]]'s first report in July 1973 recommended that a [[Central Land Council]] and a [[Northern Land Council]] be established to present to him the views of Aboriginal people. A Land Rights Bill was drafted, and the ''[[Aboriginal Land Rights Act|Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976]]'' was passed by the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] government on 16 December 1976 and began operation on 26 January 1977).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 |url=http://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00111/Html/Text |access-date=2022-03-01 |website=legislation.gov.au|archive-date=17 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220117074252/https://www.legislation.gov.au/Details/C2016C00111/Html/Text |url-status=live }}</ref> The Northern Territory Council for Aboriginal Rights was disestablished in 1976.<ref name="ntcar" />

In 1974, from Christmas Eve to Christmas Day, Darwin was devastated by tropical [[Cyclone Tracy]]. Cyclone Tracy killed 71 people, caused A$837 million in damage (approximately A$6.85 billion {{As of|2018|lc=on}})<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualDecimal.html|title=Inflation Calculator|access-date=19 July 2019|author=Reserve Bank of Australia|date=30 October 2015|archive-date=25 June 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200625131710/https://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualDecimal.html|url-status=live}}</ref> and destroyed more than 70 per cent of Darwin's buildings, including 80 per cent of houses. Tracy left more than 41,000 out of the 47,000 inhabitants of the city homeless. The city was rebuilt with much-improved construction codes and is a modern, landscaped metropolis today.{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

In the 1980s, conservation-oriented areas in the Northern Territory such as [[Kakadu National Park]] and [[Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park]] were inscribed on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] for their mix of natural heritage and Aboriginal culture.

During 1995–96 the Northern Territory was briefly one of the few places in the world with [[Euthanasia in Australia#Northern Territory|legal voluntary euthanasia]], until the Federal Parliament overturned [[Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995|the legislation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nt.gov.au/lant/parliament/committees/rotti/parldebate.shtml|title=Select Committee on Euthanasia|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302220134/http://nt.gov.au/lant/parliament/committees/rotti/parldebate.shtml|archive-date=2 March 2011|date=13 September 2007|publisher=Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory}}</ref> Before the over-riding legislation was enacted, four people used the law supported by Dr [[Philip Nitschke]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fedele |first=Robert |date=2024-02-11 |title=How the Northern Territory trailblazed Australia's voluntary assisted dying laws |url=https://anmj.org.au/how-the-northern-territory-trailblazed-australias-voluntary-assisted-dying-laws/ |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=Australian Nursing & Midwifery Journal |language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Maitland-Newcastle |first=Catholic Diocese of |title=Philip Nitschke and 'rational suicide' {{!}} Catholic Diocese of Maitland-Newcastle |url=https://www.mn.catholic.org.au/news-events/news/philip-nitschke-and-rational-suicide/ |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=www.mn.catholic.org.au}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Davey |first=Melissa |date=2016-04-22 |title=Philip Nitschke, the man who thinks we should all choose when to die |url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/22/philip-nitschke-choose-when-to-die-euthanasia-advocate |access-date=2024-09-18 |work=The Guardian |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

There are many very small settlements scattered across the Territory, but the larger population centres are located on the single paved road that links Darwin to southern Australia, the [[Stuart Highway]], known to locals simply as "the track".

The Territory is home to many spectacular natural rock formations, including [[Uluru|Uluru / Ayers Rock]] and [[Kata Tjuta|Kata Tjuta / The Olgas]] in the Central Australian region and [[Kakadu National Park]] in the north. Each of these sites are sacred to the local Aboriginal people and which have become major International tourist attractions and recognised [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage sites]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=World Heritage: Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park |url=https://parksaustralia.gov.au/uluru/discover/highlights/world-heritage/#:~:text=Uluru-Kata%20Tjuta%20National%20Park%20is%20included%20on%20the%20UNESCO,animals,%20and%20outstanding%20natural%20beauty. |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=parksaustralia.gov.au |language=en-au}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=World Heritage: Kakadu |url=https://parksaustralia.gov.au/kakadu/discover/world-heritage/ |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=parksaustralia.gov.au |language=en-au}}</ref>

The northern portion of the Territory is principally [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical savannas]], composed of several distinct [[List of ecoregions in Australia|ecoregions]] – [[Arnhem Land tropical savanna]], [[Carpentaria tropical savanna]], [[Kimberley tropical savanna]], [[Victoria Plains tropical savanna]], and [[Mitchell Grass Downs]].

The Northern Territory has two distinctive climate zones.

The northern end, including Darwin, has a tropical climate with high humidity and two seasons, the wet (October to April) and dry season (May to September). During the dry season nearly every day is warm and sunny, and afternoon humidity averages around 30%. There is very little rainfall between May and September. In the coolest months of June and July, the daily minimum temperature may dip as low as {{convert|14|C}}, but very rarely lower, and frost has never been recorded.

The [[Australian monsoon|wet season]] is associated with [[tropical cyclones]] and [[monsoon]] rains. The majority of rainfall occurs between December and March (the southern hemisphere summer), when [[thunderstorms]] are common and afternoon relative humidity averages over 70% during the wettest months. On average more than {{convert|1570|mm|abbr=on}} of rain falls in the north. Rainfall is highest in north-west coastal areas, where rainfall averages from {{convert|1800|to|2100|mm|abbr=on}}.

The central region is the [[desert]] centre of the country, which includes Alice Springs and [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock), and is [[semi-arid]] with little rain usually falling during the hottest months from October to March. Seasons are more distinct in central Australia, with very hot summers and cool winters. Frost is recorded a few times a year. The region receives less than {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}} of rain per year.

The highest temperature recorded in the territory was {{convert|48.3|C}} at [[Aputula|Finke]] on 1 and 2 January 1960. The lowest temperature was {{convert|-7.5|C}} at Alice Springs on 17 July 1976.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rainfall and Temperature Records: National |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/extreme/records/national.pdf |publisher=[[Bureau of Meteorology (Australia)|Bureau of Meteorology]] |access-date=17 November 2009 |archive-date=21 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230321174915/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/extreme/records/national.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{main|Northern Territory Parliament|Northern Territory Legislative Assembly|Proposed Northern Territory statehood}}
The Northern Territory Parliament is one of the three [[unicameralism|unicameral]] parliaments in the country. Based on the [[Westminster System]], it consists of the [[Northern Territory Legislative Assembly]] which was created in 1974, replacing the [[Northern Territory Legislative Council]]. It also produces the ''[[Northern Territory of Australia Government Gazette]]''.{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}}

The Northern Territory Legislative Council was the partly elected governing body from 1947 until its replacement by the fully elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly in 1974. The total enrolment for the 1947 election was 4,443. The Northern Territory was split into five electorates: Darwin, Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Batchelor, and Stuart.{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}}

While this assembly exercises powers similar to those of the parliaments of the states of Australia, it does so by legislated [[devolution]] of powers from the [[Australian Government|Commonwealth Government]], rather than by any constitutional right. As such, the Commonwealth Government retains the right to legislate for the territory, including the power to override legislation passed by the Legislative Assembly. The [[Monarchy of Australia|Monarch]] is represented by the [[Administrator of the Northern Territory]], who performs a role similar to that of a [[governors of the Australian states|state governor]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}}

Twenty-five members of the Legislative Assembly are elected to four-year terms from single-member [[Electoral district|electorates]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Government |first=Northern Territory |date=2017-06-16 |title=Members |url=https://parliament.nt.gov.au/members |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=parliament.nt.gov.au |language=en}}</ref>

Alongside what was cited as an arrogant approach adopted by then chief minister [[Shane Stone]], it is believed that most Territorians, regardless of their general views on statehood, were reluctant to adopt the particular offer that was made.<ref>{{cite video |title=ABC Lateline Discussion |url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s13445.htm |url-status=dead |medium=Current Affairs |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |location=Australia |date=15 October 1998 |access-date=10 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519013129/http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/stories/s13445.htm |archive-date=19 May 2006}}</ref>

===Chief minister and cabinet===
The [[Chief Minister of the Northern Territory|chief minister]] is the head of government of a self-governing territory (the head of a state government is a ''[[premier]]''). The chief minister is appointed by the [[administrator of the Northern Territory|administrator]], who in normal circumstances appoints the leader of whichever party holds the majority of seats in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The current chief minister is [[Lia Finocchiaro]] of the [[Country Liberal Party]]. The CLP defeated Territory Labor to win office on 24 August 2024.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-08-26 |title='The important work has begun': NT chief minister-elect outlines new government's first steps |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-26/lia-finocchiaro-outlines-new-nt-governments-first-steps/104254328 |access-date=2024-09-18 |work=ABC News |language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-08-24 |title=Who is Lia Finocchiaro, the woman who will become the NT's next chief minister? |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-25/lia-finocchiaro-clp-leader-chief-minister-nt-election/104266424 |access-date=2024-09-18 |work=ABC News |language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Boecker |first=Brianna |date=2024-08-26 |title=First female Country Liberal Party chief minister of the Northern Territory.

===Administrator===
The Northern Territory became self-governing on 1 July 1978 under its own [[administrator of the Northern Territory|administrator]] appointed by the [[Governor-General of Australia]]. The federal government, not the NT government, advises the governor-general on the appointment of the administrator, but by convention consults first with the Territory government. The current administrator is [[Hugh Heggie]] who commenced his three-year term on 31 January 2023; he had previously served as the [[Chief Medical Officer (Australia)|Northern Territory’s Chief Health Officer]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=McBain |first=Kirsty |date=2022-12-08 |title=Media Release: Dr Hugh Heggie PSM Appointed as Northern Territory Administrator |url=https://minister.infrastructure.gov.au/mcbain/media-release/dr-hugh-heggie-psm-appointed-northern-territory-administrator |access-date=2024-09-18}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Government |first=Northern Territory |date=2024-02-05 |title=About the Administrator |url=https://govhouse.nt.gov.au/the-administrator/about-the-administrator |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=govhouse.nt.gov.au |language=en}}</ref>

===Federal government===

The Northern Territory is represented in the [[Parliament of Australia|federal parliament]] by two members in the House of Representatives and two members in the Senate. As of May 2022, resulting from the [[2022 Australian federal election|2022 federal election]], [[Marion Scrymgour]] from the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) in [[Division of Lingiari|Lingiari]] and [[Luke Gosling]] from the [[Australian Labor Party]] (ALP) in [[Division of Solomon|Solomon]] serve in the House of Representatives, and [[Malarndirri McCarthy]] from the ALP and [[Jacinta Nampijinpa Price]] from the [[Country Liberal Party]] serve in the Senate.

===Local government===
The Northern Territory is divided into [[Local government areas of the Northern Territory|seventeen local government areas]]: two cities, three municipalities, nine regions, and three shires.  Shire, city and town councils are responsible for functions delegated by the Northern Territory parliament, such as road infrastructure and waste management. Council revenue comes mostly from property taxes and government grants.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2024-07-10 |title=Find your council |url=https://nt.gov.au/community/local-councils-remote-communities-and-homelands/find-your-council |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=Northern Territory Government |language=en}}</ref>

[[Aboriginal land council]]s in the Northern Territory are groups of Aboriginal landowners, set up under the ''[[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Aboriginal Land Rights Act |url=https://www.clc.org.au/the-alra/#:~:text=The%20Land%20Rights%20Act%20mandated,form%20a%20new%20land%20council. |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=Central Land Council |language=en-AU}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=Aboriginal Land Rights Act |url=https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/aboriginal-land-rights-act |access-date=2024-09-18 |website=National Museum of Australia |language=en}}</ref>

=== Political parties ===
The two historically dominant political parties in the Northern Territory are the conservative [[Country Liberal Party]] which governed the Territory from 1974 to 2001, from 2012 to 2016 and Since 2024, and the social-democratic [[Australian Labor Party (Northern Territory Branch)|Australian Labor Party]] which governed the Territory from 2001 to 2012 and from 2016 to 2024. Minor parties that are also active in the NT include the [[Northern Territory Greens]], the [[Shooters and Fishers Party]] and various others. It is common for [[independent politician]]s to win elections.{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}}

The CLP's rule was once so tight, that a former minister once said the CLP had a "'rightful inheritance of being the party that runs this place'".<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-08-09/nt-election-clp-seeking-return-after-two-terms-in-opposition/104185102 | title=After eight years in the political wilderness, the CLP hopes it can return to power in the NT | newspaper=ABC News | date=8 August 2024 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://territorystories.nt.gov.au/10070/462324/0/89 | title=Arcadian populism. The Country Liberal Party and Self-Government in the Northern Territory }}</ref>

The Northern Territory is the only branch of the Australian Greens to have never had any parliamentary representation as of 2024.{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}}

As fewer parties and candidates contest Northern Territory general elections than they do Australian federal elections in the Northern Territory, the CLP, Labor and independents usually have a higher vote share at territory elections than at federal elections in the Northern Territory due to the absence of right-wing minor parties such as [[Pauline Hanson's One Nation]] and the fact that the Greens do not run in every seat at territory elections.{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}}

There are Aboriginal communities in many parts of the territory, the largest ones being the [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] near [[Uluru|Uluru / Ayers Rock]], the [[Arrernte people|Arrernte]] near Alice Springs, the [[Luritja]] between those two, the [[Warlpiri people|Warlpiri]] further north, and the [[Yolngu]] in eastern [[Arnhem Land]].

==Education==
[[File:Charles Darwin University, NT.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Darwin University]]]]

===Primary and secondary===
A Northern Territory school education consists of six years of primary schooling, including one transition year, three years of middle schooling, and three years of secondary schooling. In the beginning of 2007, the Northern Territory introduced Middle School for Years 7–9 and High School for Years 10–12. Northern Territory children generally begin school at age five. On completing secondary school, students earn the [[Northern Territory Certificate of Education and Training]] (NTCET). Students who successfully complete their secondary education also receive a tertiary entrance ranking, or ATAR score, to determine university admittance.

Northern Territory schools are either publicly or privately funded. Public schools, also known as state or government schools, are funded and run directly by the Department of Education.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.education.nt.gov.au/about-us|title=About us|date=22 December 2023|website=Department of Education|publisher=Northern Territory Government|access-date=23 March 2015|archive-date=27 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227161242/http://www.education.nt.gov.au/about-us|url-status=live}}</ref> Private fee-paying schools include schools run by the Catholic Church and independent schools, some elite ones similar to English [[Public school (UK)|public schools]]. Some Northern Territory Independent schools are affiliated with [[Protestant]], [[Lutheran]], [[Anglican]], [[Greek Orthodox]] or [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]es, but include non-church schools and an Indigenous school.

As of 2009, the Northern Territory had 151 public schools, 15 Catholic schools and 21 independent schools. 39,492 students were enrolled in schools around the territory with 29,175 in public schools, and 9,882 in independent schools. The Northern Territory has about 4,000 full-time teachers.

===Tertiary===
The Northern Territory has [[List of universities in Australia|one university]] which opened in 1989 under the name of the [[Northern Territory University]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdu.edu.au/25th-anniversary|title=Celebrating 25 Years of University Education in the Northern Territory|access-date=24 March 2015|archive-date=17 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190717122525/https://www.cdu.edu.au/25th-anniversary|url-status=live}}</ref> Now renamed as the [[Charles Darwin University]], it had about 19,000 students enrolled: about 5,500 higher education students and about 13,500 students on vocational education and training (VET) courses. The first tertiary institution in the territory was the [[Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education]] which was established in the mid-1960s.

===Libraries and archives===
[[Library & Archives NT]] is the Northern Territory's public research library and archival organisation and it supports the development of library services across the Territory by supporting public libraries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Visit Us {{!}} Library & Archives NT |url=https://lant.nt.gov.au/visit-us |access-date=2024-03-14 |website=lant.nt.gov.au |archive-date=14 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240314002259/https://lant.nt.gov.au/visit-us |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Services to Public Libraries {{!}} Library & Archives NT |url=https://lant.nt.gov.au/services-public-libraries |access-date=2024-03-14 |website=lant.nt.gov.au |archive-date=14 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240314002259/https://lant.nt.gov.au/services-public-libraries |url-status=live }}</ref> Library & Archives NT was formed in 2019 following the merge of the Northern Territory Archives Service and the Northern Territory Library.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Find & Connect Web Resource Project |first=The University of Melbourne and Australian Catholic University |title=Library & Archives NT – Organisation – Find & Connect – Northern Territory |url=https://www.findandconnect.gov.au/ref/nt/biogs/ENT0112b.htm |access-date=2024-03-14 |website=findandconnect.gov.au|archive-date=14 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240314002259/https://www.findandconnect.gov.au/ref/nt/biogs/ENT0112b.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Economy==

===Mining===
[[File:Ranger Uranium Mine in Kakadu National Park.jpeg|alt=|thumb|[[Ranger Uranium Mine]] in the [[Kakadu National Park]]]]
The Northern Territory's economy is largely driven by [[Mining in the Northern Territory|mining]], which is concentrated on energy producing [[mineral]]s, petroleum and energy and contributes around $2.5 billion to the [[Gross regional domestic product|gross state product]] and employs over 4,600 people. Mining accounts for 14.9% of the gross state product in 2014–15 compared to just 7% nationally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nt.gov.au/d/Minerals_Energy/index.cfm?header=About%20Minerals%20and%20Energy |title=About Minerals and Energy Department of Regional Development, Primary Industry, Fisheries and Resources |website=Nt.gov.au |date=16 September 2011 |access-date=23 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523211519/http://www.nt.gov.au/d/Minerals_Energy/index.cfm?header=About%20Minerals%20and%20Energy |archive-date=23 May 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In recent years, largely due to the effect of major infrastructure projects and mine expansions, construction has overtaken mining as the largest single industry in the territory. Construction, mining and manufacturing, and government and community services, combine to account for about half of the territory's gross state product (GSP), compared to about a third of national gross domestic product (GDP).<ref name="Economy-Overview">{{cite web|url=https://www.budget.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/277602/2016-17-Economy-Overview.pdf|title=Budget 2016-17 Northern Territory Economy Overview|access-date=16 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170224040656/https://budget.nt.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0006/277602/2016-17-Economy-Overview.pdf|archive-date=24 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The economy has grown considerably over the past decade, from a value of $15 billion in 2004–05 to over $22 billion in 2014–15. In 2012–13 the territory economy expanded by 5.6%, over twice the level of national growth, and in 2014–15 it grew by 10.5%, four times the national growth rate.<ref name="Economy-Overview"/>

Between 2003 and 2006 the gross state product had risen from $8.67 billion to $11.476 billion, an increase of 32.4%. During the three years to 2006–2007 the Northern Territory gross state product grew by an average annual rate of 5.5%. Gross state product per capita in the Northern Territory ($72,496) is higher than any Australian state or territory and is also higher than the gross domestic product per capita for Australia ($54,606).

The Northern Territory's exports were up 12.9% or $681 million in 2012–13. The largest contributor to the territory's exports was: mineral fuels (largely LNG), crude materials (mainly mineral ores) and food and live animals (primarily live cattle). The main international markets for territory exports are Japan, China, Indonesia, the United States and Korea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treasury.nt.gov.au/_layouts/download.aspx?SourceUrl=/PMS/Publications/BudgetFinance/BudgetPapers/I-BP07-1415.docx|title=Archived copy|access-date=1 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321135743/http://www.treasury.nt.gov.au/_layouts/download.aspx?SourceUrl=%2FPMS%2FPublications%2FBudgetFinance%2FBudgetPapers%2FI-BP07-1415.docx|archive-date=21 March 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Imports to the Northern Territory totalled $2,887.8 million which consisted of mainly machinery and equipment manufacturing (58.4%) and petroleum, coal, chemical and associated product manufacturing (17.0%).<ref name="ABS Economics">{{cite web | title = Northern Territory Economics | publisher = Australian Bureau of Statistics | url = http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/9ee724f9094de980ca257384000dbaa1!OpenDocument | date = 31 October 2007 | access-date = 27 July 2008 | archive-date = 10 August 2008 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080810023527/http://www.abs.gov.au/ausstats/abs@.nsf/7d12b0f6763c78caca257061001cc588/9ee724f9094de980ca257384000dbaa1!OpenDocument | url-status = live }}</ref>

The principal mining operations are bauxite at Gove Peninsula where the production is estimated to increase 52.1% to $254 million in 2007–08, manganese at Groote Eylandt, production is estimated to increase 10.5% to $1.1 billion which will be helped by the newly developed mines include Bootu Creek and Frances Creek, gold which is estimated to increase 21.7 per cent to $672 million at the Union Reefs plant and uranium at Ranger Uranium Mine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.budget.nt.gov.au/papers/econ/8_mining_energy.pdf |title=Northern Territory Budget Mining and energy |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720225746/http://www.budget.nt.gov.au/papers/econ/8_mining_energy.pdf |archive-date=20 July 2008 |access-date=29 January 2017 }}</ref>

The Northern Territory is the most sparsely populated state or territory in Australia.

The NT has a connected network of sealed roads, including two national highways, linking with adjoining states and connecting the major territory population centres, and other important centres such as Uluru (Ayers Rock), [[Kakadu Highway|Kakadu]] and Litchfield National Parks. The Stuart Highway, once known as "The Track", runs north to south, connecting Darwin and [[Alice Springs]] to [[Adelaide]]. Some of the sealed roads are single-lane bitumen. Many unsealed (dirt) roads connect the more remote settlements.

The fatigue resulting from long-distance driving and the hazards inherent in dirt roads, wildlife, water crossings and wild weather have led the Northern Territory Government to pursue road safety campaigns in English and several Aboriginal languages. Persuading people to drive at the right speed for the road conditions has been a key goal.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://roadsafety.nt.gov.au/campaigns/drive-to-conditions2 |title=Drive to conditions |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=2021 |website=Towards Zero |publisher=Northern Territory Government |access-date=3 January 2022 |archive-date=3 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220103055147/https://roadsafety.nt.gov.au/campaigns/drive-to-conditions2 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://nt.gov.au/driving/safety/fatigue-and-driving |title=Fatigue and driving |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=March 2015 |website=Department of Infrastructure, Planning and Logistics |publisher=Northern Territory Government |access-date=3 January 2022 |archive-date=3 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220103055148/https://nt.gov.au/driving/safety/fatigue-and-driving |url-status=live }}</ref> {{As of|2021}}, the Northern Territory's road vehicle speed limit in built-up areas was 60&nbsp;kilometres per hour unless the town had gazetted a lower default speed limit: many had chosen 50&nbsp;km/h or lower.

==Telecommunication technologies==
There have been several programmes/strategies implemented that highlight the need for an upgrade of the telecommunications infrastructure in the Northern Territory to provide high speed broadband technologies to all residents—especially for the disadvantaged Indigenous residents of remote communities.

One such the programme was undertaken by [[Perry Morrison]] and published in Urban Studies in 2000. It was entitled "A Pilot Implementation of [[Internet]] access for Remote [[Aboriginal]] Communities in the "[[Top End]]" of Australia. Which involved implementing an internet and email access programmes, to the four remote aboriginal communities of Milikapiti, Port Keats (Karudu Numida), Titjikala and Pirlangimpi. The overall project was a success; however, it did expose some areas of concern, such as the lack line of quality in numerous communities throughout the territory. This resulted in an inability to provide internet services to these communities. An upgrade in telecommunications infrastructure was thought to be the answer to resolve this issue.

A letter was sent to the [[Australian House of Representatives]] Communications, Information Technologies and the Arts Committee by Minister of Corporate and Information Services by [[Peter Toyne]] on 18 June 2002, enquiring into the opportunity of providing wireless technology to all Territorians. The letter highlighted the high cost of expanding the existing terrestrial broadband infrastructure (particularly in remote areas) and compared it to the fast and cheaper alternative of a wireless network. However, to be consider viable the wireless technology would have to be proven to be reliable and affordable to all Australians.

The Remote Areas Telecommunications Strategy for 2003–2008 was commended to the [[Commonwealth Government]] by Toyne. It focuses on delivering better telecommunication services to the indigenous residents of remote communities. It will also make such telecommunication services reliable and affordable, so that all Territorians have the ability and opportunity to partake in the information age. The government hopes to achieve these goals through the following strategies:
* Equitable access: by delivering broadband services to remote communities, at the same cost of (within two years of introduction) the same Broadband services being provided in urban areas of Australia, and by developing infrastructure in one hundred and twenty remote communities throughout the Northern Territory. To provide quality large capacity telecommunication services to these areas over the five year period from 2003 to 2008.
* Driving Demand: By providing education on consumer rights and responsibilities to the indigenous residents of remote communities. Targeting the indigenous residents of these remote communities by providing culturally appropriate content and applications. Also by improving private sector and government services to these remote communities.
* Partnerships: Securing funding Territory wide to provide solutions to telecommunication infrastructure. Collaborating with indigenous organisations to develop, culturally appropriate content and applications, which will be utilised in the remote communities.
* Efficient Delivery: Reducing the telecommunications cost to government, by forming agreements with local and remote community councils. Combining their access and demand needs to provide affordable telecommunication services.
* Community Delivery: By supplying constant assistance in the remote communities by way of an entity or organisation, that assists the residents of the communities with any problems or issues. This entity or organisation could also liaise with the government, private sector and telecommunications organisations.

# 4. An article in the N.T. Business review dated 13 December 2007 by [[Anastasia Govan]]. Entitled "Broadband debate the key to NT's future". In which Govan writes" Despite all the noise about broadband during the weeks of the recent federal election, high speed telecommunications remain an elusive pipe dream for most of the Northern Territory" (2007 p.007) Broadband debate key to NT's future. The article addresses the fact that the residents of remote Territory communities (most of whom are indigenous Australians) have little or no ability to access basic internet services. Such internet services are readily available in other states and taken for granted by most Australians. The gap in the quality of telecommunication services provided to the remote communities (if any in some cases), compared to the standard provided

In metropolitan areas of Australia is only getting bigger. To rectify this problem a strategy utilising both optical and wireless technologies is needed. To delivery these high speed broadband services to all Australians. As Govan (2007 p.007) (Broadband key to NT's future) states "This issue must be addressed in the next six to two months if we are to maintain our global Competitiveness". Australian's reputation as a nation of innovators and problem solvers is in peril, unless changes to telecommunication infrastructure are created and implemented.-->
