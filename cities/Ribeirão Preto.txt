[[Image:Vista Aérea RP - 2010.JPG|thumb|right|Aerial view of Ribeirão Preto in 2010]]
'''Ribeirão Preto''' (Portuguese pronunciation: [[Help:IPA/Portuguese|[ʁibejˈɾɐ̃w ˈpɾetu]]]) is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] and a [[metropolitan area]] located in the northeastern region of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] state, Brazil.

Ribeirão Preto is the eighth-largest municipality in the State with {{convert|650.9|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. It has an estimated population of 720,216 in 2021 and a [[metropolitan area]] of 1,178,910. It is located {{convert|313|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the [[São Paulo|city of São Paulo]] and {{convert|706|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Brasília]], the federal capital. Its mean altitude is {{convert|526.8|m|ft|abbr=on}} high. The city's average temperature throughout the year is {{convert|23|C|F}}, and the original predominant vegetation is the Atlantic forest.

The city originated around 1856 as an agricultural region. Coffee was a primary income source until 1929 when it lost value when compared with the [[industrial sector]]. In the second half of the 20th century, investment in health, [[biotechnology]], [[bioenergy]], and information technology led to the city being declared a Technological Center in 2010. These activities have caused the city to have the 30th biggest gross national (GNP) in Brazil.

The city is also an important cultural center. The Mayor Luiz Roberto Jábali Park, the Maurilio Biagi Park, Carlos Raya Park, Santa Tereza Reserve, and the Zoo are important preservation areas. Pinguim Beerhouse, Dom Pedro Theatre, and projects such as Ribeirão Preto's Cinema Center are relevant sightseeing points, along with events such as the Agrishow Agricultural Fair, Tanabata Festival, Joao Rock Music Festival, and the National Outdoor Book Fair.

== History ==
{{See also|Coffee production in Brazil}}
[[File:Ribeiraopreto.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Panoramic view of Ribeirão Preto in 2006]]
The municipality was founded June 19, 1856, being populated initially by farmers and African slaves coming from other areas of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] (especially from [[Mogi Mirim]] and [[São Simão, São Paulo|São Simão]]) and [[Minas Gerais]] looking for land with good pastures. The city was built by a stream called Black Creek, and was named after it (''Ribeirão Preto'' means black creek in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], sometimes translated as "Black Stream"). The fertile soil of Ribeirão Preto region allowed a high [[crop productivity]].

Initially the main rural activities were pastures, cattle and subsistence agriculture. In the 1870s, the coffee crop arrived to Ribeirão Preto. The rapid development of coffee cultivation brought wealth and progress to the city, which by the 1880s had become the largest coffee producer in the world. Coffee, also called "green gold", caused a "gold rush" in the region, which attracted workers and adventurous people from many parts of the world. This movement was helped by the new [[Mogiana Railway]], linking Ribeirão Preto to [[São Paulo (city)|São Paulo]] and to the port city of [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]], and by the abolition of [[slavery]] in Brazil, in 1888. The end of slavery created a strong market for labor, and "coffee barons", as coffee farmers were called, also stimulated [[immigration]]. Immigrants coming from Europe (mostly [[Italy]], but also from [[Portugal]], [[Spain]] and [[Germany]]) and from [[Japan]] have settled in coffee farms of Ribeirão Preto and neighboring towns. Some of the immigrants, especially the Italians, were settled at the "Núcleo Colonial Antonio Prado" (Antonio Prado Colonial Nucleus) which was created by the government in 1887. This nucleus originated many of the northern and eastern districts of Ribeirão Preto.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Silva, Adriana Capretz Borges da |title=Expansão urbana e formação dos territórios de pobreza em Ribeirão Preto: os bairros surgidos a partir do Núcleo Colonial Antonio Prado (1887) |publisher=UFSCar |year=2008 |location=São Carlos}}</ref> Later, after the [[stock market crash]] of 1929, some of the immigrants bought the farms from their impoverished former employers.

== Demography ==
Adding to the Native Amerindians already living in the area when migrants began to occupy and settle the land, the population of Ribeirão Preto includes, amongst other groups, descendants of Africans, Italians, [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], Spanish, Japanese, Germans, Lebanese immigrants who were attracted to the region, after the [[slavery in Brazil|abolition of slavery]] in 1888, when immigrants were granted lands, after being indentured workers. Descendants of enslaved African people constitute a big and important element of the population. Italians also arrived in huge number.

During the 1990s, Northeastern migrants came to the region attracted by São Paulo state cities' economic development, which was widely broadcast in TV documentaries. With the city's super population by individuals who often had no technical skills and were often [[illiterate]], poverty and crime grew considerably. Many migrants boosted the economy by working in sugar cane plantations and orange groves, though. However, those who perform seasonal duties often have no safety net when the work is over. [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] estimative (2020) indicates that Ribeirão Preto has a population of 711,825 inhabitants. The [[urban agglomeration]] incorporates 34 municipalities, with a population of about 1.4 million inhabitants.

== Tourism, culture and events==
[[File:Ribeirao Preto Teatro.jpg|thumb|left|Teatro Pedro II]]
At the beginning of the 20th century and during its first three decades, Ribeirão Preto was a rich city, boasting several [[mansion]]s, European-style cafés, [[cabaret]]s and even two [[opera house]]s, as result of the coffee economy. One of the opera houses – the ''Carlos Gomes Theatre'' (in honour of Brazilian opera composer [[Antônio Carlos Gomes|Carlos Gomes]]) – was demolished in 1949, but the other – the "Pedro II Theatre" (named in honor of Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Dom Pedro II]]), dating from the 1920s – resisted time and was restored and modernized during the 1990s. Its ceiling, completely destroyed in a fire of 1980, was rebuilt and gained a new design projected by Japanese-Brazilian artist [[Tomie Ohtake]]. The Pedro II Theatre is now the third largest opera house in Brazil and is the home of the Ribeirão Preto [[symphony orchestra]], one of the oldest and most important in Brazil.

Several events take place in Ribeirão Preto, many of which occur annually, such as the Agrishow (an international fair of agricultural technology), Fair Photo Image, Film Festival Ribeirão Preto, National Book Fair of Ribeirão Preto, Festival Tanabata (Japanese cultural festival), Festitália (Italian cultural festival), João Rock Music Fest, Ribeirão Rodeo Music, Bonfim Paulista Rodeo Show, Ribeirão Skol Folia, Fair ExpoHair, Feitrans (Fair Transport Interior Paulista), Arena Cross, Entorta Bixo, Ribeirão Cana Invest, Expobonsai, AVIRRP, Comida di Buteco, Restaurant Week Ribeirão Preto, Ribeirão Preto Tropeada, Mitsubishi Rally Cup, Copa Chevrolet Montana, and others. These events move various segments of the municipality, as the airport, bus system, taxi, hotel chain, bars, restaurants, and more.

The municipality has a hot climate, which makes people go out in the evening to chat and enjoy cold draft beers in bars. Therefore, the municipality is teeming with bars, from the simple "botequins" or "botecos" that one can find in almost every corner, to the most sophisticated pub style bars, which rival their counterparts in São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Ribeirão Preto has also many micro-breweries, many of them nationally known.

Ribeirão Preto is considered one of the major centers of business tourism in the country, being chosen by the Ministry of Tourism as an inducer of regional tourism development, between 4 cities of São Paulo and 64 other locations throughout Brazil. Currently the city has 52 hotels in full operation, with 8600 beds (or jobs), beyond 30 motels with 2000 beds, beds totaling 10,600 rooms in the network of the city.

There are still many convention centers and event spaces, such as:

Situated in the historic city center, (the company's former headquarters Brewery Paulista), this historical and cultural heritage is listed by the Defense Council of Historical, Artistic, Archaeological and Tourism of the State of São Paulo (Condephaat), Council of Heritage Preservation Cultural de Ribeirão Preto (Conppac) and at present is in the process of overturning the Iphan – "Institute of National Historical and Artistic Heritage.

In addition, the city still has the largest film society in the country, Cineclube Cauim (900 seats), and dozens of mainstream cinema rooms, such as UCI, Cinemark and Cinepolis.

===Carnival===
Ribeirão Preto is the birthplace of one of the oldest samba schools in Brazil: the "Bambas" founded in 1927. However, as a string carnival, becoming samba schools later. Besides this pioneering school, there are the Embaixadores dos Campos Elíseos (Ambassadors of Campos Elíseos), Tradição do Ipiranga (Tradition of Ipiranga), Camisa 12 Corintiana (12 Corinthian Shirt) and Imperadores do Samba (Emperors of Samba). In [[Bonfim Paulista]] district, two samba schools are present: Acadêmicos de Bonfim and Unidos da Vila.

In 2010, Ribeirão Preto was chosen as the theme for Águias de Ouro Samba School parade, in São Paulo Sambodrome, showing its history related to coffee, sugar cane and agribusiness.

There are also some street carnival groups, such as "Os Alegrões" (Jardim Irajá neighborhood) and "O Berro" (in the city center).

== Sports ==

The municipality possesses two soccer stadiums, the [[Estádio Palma Travassos]] (of [[Comercial Futebol Clube (Ribeirão Preto)|Comercial FC]]) and [[Estádio Santa Cruz|Santa Cruz]] (of [[Botafogo Futebol Clube (SP)|Botafogo FC]]). Botafogo FC is currently competing in [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série B]] and [[Campeonato Paulista]], whereas Comercial FC is currently competing in [[Campeonato Paulista Série A3]]. On the national and international scene, Botafogo is often confused with the Rio de Janeiro club with the same name to the extent that the Rio club is often credited with being the infamous club against which Pelé scored a record 8 goals in one game. One example is in Franklin Foer's book "How Soccer Explains the World". But it was in the Paulista championships on November 21, 1964, in the coastal city of [[Santos (São Paulo)|Santos]] and against the Ribeirão Preto's team that Pelé achieved the incredible feat and his Santos team won by an 11&nbsp;×&nbsp;0 score. The 8 goals were payback for the defeat Santos suffered on September 6, 1964, when they visited Ribeirão Preto during the first round of the tournament and lost 2 x 0. Not only had a "small" team beaten one of the "big" teams, but had done so while insulting the "King". A better claim to fame for Botafogo (often referred to as Botafogo-SP) is that Brazilian soccer captains (and brothers) [[Sócrates]] and [[Raí]] started their careers with Botafogo.

In 2017 a men's volleyball team was founded in Ribeirão Preto, [[Vôlei Ribeirão]], which was champion of [[Superliga Brasileira B]] in 2018, and competed in [[Brazilian Men's Volleyball Superliga|Superliga Brasileira]], the major volleyball league in Brazil, from 2019 to 2021. The matches of Vôlei Ribeirão took place at Cava do Bosque, a public sports centre in Ribeirão Preto. The volleyball team ended in 2021.

After the [[New York Stock Exchange]] crash of 1929 the economy of Ribeirão Preto, based on a single export [[agriculture|crop]], collapsed, and the city had to adapt to a new situation. Since the city is relatively far from other major Brazilian urban centers, it found a new economic vocation in the services and commercial sector, which was developed to attend the local and regional demands.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The second economic boom in the history of Ribeirão Preto occurred after the oil crisis ([[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]) of the 1970s. The increase in the oil price obliged Brazil to look for alternative means of [[fuel]]ing and the solution found was the alcohol fuel program, or ''[[Pro-Álcool]]'' as it is called. Pró-Álcool led to the development of a technology which allows the use of ethanol ([[sugarcane]] alcohol) either as automotive fuel or as a gasoline additive. The latter improves performance and substitutes lead thus decreasing [[air pollution|polluting]] emissions. Due to the Pró-Álcool program, farmers from the region of Ribeirão Preto were encouraged by government [[subsidy|subsidies]] to grow sugarcane. The high productivity of the land around Ribeirão Preto rapidly placed the region as the largest alcohol and sugar producer of the world, being responsible for 30 percent of Brazil's sugarcane alcohol fuel.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The sugarcane boom brought a new age of prosperity for the city, which was called the "Brazilian California" during the 1980s and early 1990s. On the one hand, this has increased the city's wealth and turned it into a sophisticated centre of services for Brazil and South America but, on the other hand, the image of a new "[[El Dorado|Eldorado]]" attracted many migrants from impoverished areas of Brazil leading to a rapid [[population growth]] and the appearance of [[slum]]s (''favelas'' as they are called in Brazil).<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20140613-brazil-football-world-cup-french-Riberiao-Preto-favelas|title=Ribeirao Preto, the 'Brazilian California' – France 24|date=June 13, 2014|publisher=France 24|access-date=June 9, 2018}}</ref>

During the [[economic stagnation]] from the 1940s to the 1950s the city discovered and established its vocation as an educational and university center. In 1942 the state government expropriated the Monte Alegre Farm, an important coffee farm from the Schmidt family of German immigrants, and transformed it into an agricultural practical school. Several new buildings and houses for the professors were constructed on a land which held before tens of thousands of coffee plants. The new school was very well planned and urbanized and many trees were planted to provide shadow and give it a pleasant atmosphere. But the agricultural school never achieved a significant development and it was closed in 1951. A longstanding dream of the population of Ribeirão Preto was to have a university and in 1952 the old farm was donated to the [[University of São Paulo]] for the creation of a [[medical school]], which was the first school of its campus at Ribeirão Preto.

Fortunately, many original buildings of the agricultural school and even some of the Monte Alegre Farm were preserved and only adapted to hold the new university, which makes its campus one of the most beautiful university campuses in Brazil. After the creation of the medical school the University of São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto (USP-RP) has been growing steadily and it is presently constituted by eight schools: [[Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirão Preto|School of Medicine of Ribeirão Preto]] (FMRP), [[Faculdade de Direito de Ribeirão Preto|School of Law of Ribeirão Preto]] (FDRP), [[Faculdade de Filosofia, Ciências e Letras de Ribeirão Preto|School of Philosophy, Sciences and Letters]] (FFCLRP), School of Dentistry (FORP), School of Economics, Administration and Accounting (FEARP), School of Pharmaceutical Sciences (FCFRP), School of Nursing (EERP) and School of Music (DMRP-ECA).
