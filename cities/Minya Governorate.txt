'''Minya Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|محافظة المنيا}} ''{{transl|arz|Muḥāfẓet El Minya}}'') is one of the [[governorates of Egypt|governorates]] of [[Upper Egypt]]. Its capital city, [[Minya, Egypt|Minya]], is located on the left bank of the [[Nile River]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Merriam Webster's Geographical Dictionary|year=1998|url=https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersg1998merr|url-access=registration|publisher=Merriam Webster|page=[https://archive.org/details/merriamwebstersg1998merr/page/354 354]|edition=Third|isbn=9780877795469 }}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name originates from the chief city of the governorate, originally known in [[Coptic language|Sahidic Coptic]] as ''Tmoone'' and in Boلhairic as ''Thmonē'', meaning “the residence”, in reference to a [[monastery]] formerly in the area. The name may also originate from the city's name in [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] ''Men'at Khufu''.
