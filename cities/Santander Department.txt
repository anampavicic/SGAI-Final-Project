'''Santander''' ({{IPA|es|santanˈdeɾ}}) is a [[Departments of Colombia|department]] of [[Colombia]]. Santander inherited the name of one of the nine original states of the [[United States of Colombia]]. It is located in the central northern part of the country, borders the [[Magdalena River]] to the east, [[Boyacá Department|Boyacá]] to the south and southeast, the [[Norte de Santander Department]] to the northeast, the [[Cesar Department]] to the north, the [[Bolivar Department|Bolivar]] and [[Antioquia Department]]s to the west. Its capital is the city of [[Bucaramanga]].

== History ==
{{more citations needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Pre-Columbian era ===
Prior to the arrival of the [[Spanish people|Spaniards]], the territory now known as Santander was inhabited by [[Amerindian]] ethnic groups: [[Muisca people|Muisca]], [[Chitarero people|Chitareros]], [[Lache people|Laches]], [[Yariguí]], [[Opón]], [[Carare]] and [[Guane people|Guanes]].

Their political and social structure was based on ''cacicazgos'', a federation of tribes led by a ''[[cacique]]'', with different social classes. Their main activity was planting [[maize]], [[bean]]s, [[Cassava|yuca]], [[arracacha]], [[cotton]], [[agave]], [[tobacco]], [[tomato]], [[pineapple]] and [[guava]], among others. Their agricultural skills were sufficiently developed to take advantage of the different mountainous terrains. The Guanes utilized [[Terrace (agriculture)|terraces]] and an artificial system of [[irrigation]]. They had a knowledge of arts and crafts based on ovens to produce [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]]. They had cotton to make clothing and accessories such as hats and bags.

=== Colonization ===
Spanish conqueror [[Antonio de Lebrija (conquistador)|Antonio de Lebrija]] led the first expedition through the area in 1529. The area was later invaded c. 1532 by [[German people|German]] [[Ambrosius Ehinger]] in a quest to find ''[[El Dorado]]''. This disrupted or destroyed many of the Amerindian villages. Some ethnic groups like the Yariguíes, Opones, and Carares fought the conquerors until they became extinct. Explorer [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] later went to the area in an effort to appease the tribes. The colonization process in the area was started by [[Martín Galeano]] who founded the village of [[Vélez, Santander|Vélez]] on July 3, 1539 and [[Pedro de Ursúa]] and [[Ortún Velázquez de Velasco]] founded the village of [[Pamplona, Norte de Santander|Pamplona]] (now part of the [[Norte de Santander Department]]) in 1549.

Once the [[Amerindian]] tribes were dominated, the Spanish organized the territory based on [[Cabildo (council)|Cabildo]]s (councils) to maintain the dominance and administer justice in the conquered territory. Amerindians were assimilated and subject to the encomienda regime to work in agriculture, manufacturing goods, and mines. These two villages functioned as centers for the Cabildos' territories. In 1636 the Cabildo of Vélez was transferred to a new jurisdiction centered on the village of [[Girón, Santander|Girón]], comprising from the [[Sogamoso River]], and [[Río del Oro River|Río del Oro]] to the [[Magdalena River]]. The village of [[San Gil]] was created in 1689, segregated from the Jurisdiction of Vélez. In 1789 the village of [[Socorro, Santander|Socorro]] was also segregated from Vélez and they were all put under the mandate of the [[Tunja|Province of Tunja]], a subdivision of the [[Viceroyalty of New Granada]]. On July 9, 1795 the ''corregimiento'' of Vélez&nbsp;– San Gil&nbsp;– Socorro was created due to the unsustainability of the Province of Tunja, and local government was established in the village of Socorro.

== Culture ==

The department's culture descends from a mix of Spanish and Chibcha influences, particularly in the south where the Muisca controlled territory and in the [[Chicamocha Canyon]] where the [[Guane people|Guane]] are situated. During the colony and independence war times, people from Santander were especially recognized for their bravery in battle and their policy of "not even a step back". Soldiers from Santander were valued and respected but also difficult to control as they were, in general, more politically aware than people from other regions and therefore prone to question orders and law.{{Citation needed|date=February 2024}}

== Cuisine ==
{{cleanup rewrite|date=June 2022}}
Santander cuisine includes regional specialties and food from the Department's capital city of [[Bucaramanga]] and other cities such as [[Cepita]].

The most famous dishes are [[sancocho]], [[oreada]] (dried cured beef), [[mute (soup)|mute]], egg broth, yellow [[arepa]], [[masato]], [[Guarapo (drink)|guarapo]], [[aguapanela]], [[tamale]], and the exotic [[culona ant]]s.

Usually accompanied by [[pepitoria]] and yellow arepa, it can be eaten fried, oven-baked, or dried.

=== ''Arepa Santandereana'' ===
Flat corn bread. This dish includes chicharron (pork belly-fat) and cooked peeled corn. When possible, the peeled corn is roasted in clay pots, to provide even more flavor.

=== ''Mute'' ===
A soup prepared with a variety of ingredients such as red meat, tripe, beef ribs, grains, potatoes, pasta, corn, and spices. Due to the ingredients included, it has a thick consistency.

=== ''Pepitoria'' ===
Pepitoria is prepared with the intestines of a goat or lamb. Served with rice, yuca, and potatoes.

=== ''Santander tamale'' ===
The tamale is a dish that is eaten in various parts of Colombia, but in Santander it is prepared with peeled corn dough and filled with beef, chicken or pork, chickpeas, onions, and paprika. It is then wrapped in banana leaf giving it a rectangular shape.

This is a marinated, salted, sun-dried beef ready to grill. It is a classic dish that can be found in many restaurants as a specialty, served with yucca and chili.

=== ''Hormigas Culonas (Big Bum Ants)'' ===

=== ''Bocadillo Veleño'' ===
Created in the town of Vélez, the Veleño Sandwich is prepared with the pulp of ripe Guava and is wrapped in a bijao leaf, giving it a characteristic flavor. It is sometimes paired with goat cheese.

There is also a variation called changua or chingua, which is normally prepared with water, potatoes, milk, cream and  coriander. Sometimes broth (caldo) and changua comes with chicken or beef. Not to be confused with ajiaco, which is eaten in Bogota with creamy potato, huascas (green herb) and shredded chicken.

=== ''Obleas wafers'' ===
The wafer is a superfine cookie that is spread with Arequipe (caramel, sweetened milk spread). Over time, other ingredients such as cheese, blackberry, chocolate, etc. have been incorporated.

=== ''Chorizo from the [[Valle de San José|San José Valley]]'' ===
12 km from San Gil, on the road that leads to Charalá, you will find a town called Valle de San José. People from this region say this is the best Colombian Chorizo, but people from [[Santa Rosa de Cabal]], in the [[Columbian coffee growing axis|Coffee Zone]], will tell you the same.
