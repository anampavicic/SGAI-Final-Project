Táchira State covers a total surface area of {{convert|11100|km2}} and as of the 2011 census, had a population of 1,168,908. At the end of the 19th century, Táchira State was where oil was discovered in Venezuela. Currently, its main economic revenues come from the production of coffee and pineapple. The cattle and [[agricultural]] activities play an important role in Táchira's economy. There is also a strong [[Industry (manufacturing)|industrial]] sector which focuses on the processing of [[potato]], [[sugar]], [[milk]], and [[cheese]] and the production of textiles.

Táchira State is one of the three [[Venezuelan Andes|Venezuelan Andean]] states (the other two are [[Mérida (state)|Mérida]] and [[Trujillo (state)|Trujillo]]). This state borders [[Zulia State]] to the north, [[Barinas (state)|Barinas]] and Mérida States to the east, [[Apure (state)|Apure]] and Barinas States to the south, and [[Colombia]] ([[Norte de Santander Department]]) to the west.

==Etymology==
Possible origins have been identified for the word Táchira, so one hypothesis states that the word is an indigenous word - based on Chibcha dialects - composed of three particles: ta, "farm" (as a root), chi, "ours, which belongs to us" and the suffix rá, "element that expresses place, moment or position (...)" with respect to the future. Thus, it would mean approximately a term like: "The land that will be our inheritance" or "The land of our inheritance".{{cn|date=December 2022}}

On the other hand, it is believed that Táchira comes from a Chibcha word that comes from the term "tachure", which identifies a purple dye plant that has medicinal uses, known as tun-túa or sibidigua (Jatropa gossypifolia).{{cn|date=December 2022}}

==History==

===Spanish colonization===
Populated mainly by groups of Timote, Cuica and Chibcha origin and as the Machirí, Umuquena and Táriba, the territory was extensively colonized in the sixteenth century.

With the foundation of San Cristóbal in 1561 by Captain Juan Maldonado Ordoñez y Villaquirán and La Grita in 1576 by Francisco de Cáceres, the agricultural exploitation of the area began, giving rise to the creation of new settlements. Since its foundation in 1576, La Grita was the capital of the Province of La Grita, so the importance of this city was primitive in the region until the arrival of European trading companies to the state, which settled mainly in the more accessible and better communicated San Cristóbal.

In 1781 Juan Jose Garcia de Hevia led the Insurrection of the Communards of Los Andes, an anti-colonial revolutionary movement that sought to liberate Venezuela from the colonialism of the Spanish Empire, under the search for tax relief.

During the [[Venezuelan War of Independence]], [[Simon Bolivar]] invaded the country through the Táchira in his Admirable Campaign.

===18th and 19th centuries===
Despite the progressive population growth of the region, its importance as Venezuela's main coffee producer for over two hundred years and the arrival of important European trading houses in the 19th century, the state remained relatively isolated from the rest of the country, with greater cultural influence received from Colombia for many years.
[[File:Casa Steinvorth.jpg|thumb|German attic style heritage house built between 1884 and 1888 in San Cristóbal, Táchira State]]
In a country that now depends on an economy based on oil income, the Táchira was privileged to have the first oil wells in Venezuela. At the end of the 19th century the national oil industry was born in the place now called La Petrolia.

On March 11, 1856, by decree of the Sovereign Congress of the Republic, the Province of Táchira was created, formed with the cantons of San Cristóbal, San Antonio, Lobatera and La Grita. It was decided that the capital of the Province would be San Cristóbal and there the headquarters of all the organs of the Provincial Government were established, with a general population of 42,731 inhabitants.
The decree of the congress with date 11 of March was sanctioned by the National Executive day 14. General Jose Tadeo Monagas governed in the Country, who named to exercise the position of the Province, to the citizen Pascual Casanova, assuming the position of Governor of the State Táchira, this civil employee was named May 9 being sworn in its position the 1 of July 1856.

In 1881, during the second presidency of General Antonio Guzmán Blanco, the National Constitution was reformed, establishing that the Republic is composed of nine great States; one of them was the great State of the Andes, with the sections Trujillo, Mérida and Táchira, each section being divided into districts. The executive power of the Táchira section was exercised by General Rosendo Medina, who was replaced by General Francisco Alvarado, who was short-lived because President Guzmán Blanco imposed his delegate in the Táchira, General Marcos Rodríguez. The arrival of General Ignacio Andrade to the presidency of the Republic favored the State, since the first National Magistrate to weaken the political-administrative structures of former President Joaquín Crespo, influenced the Congress to achieve a new territorial division.

In 1895, the Gran Ferrocarril del Táchira was inaugurated, its construction began in 1893 with an extension of 105 kilometers between La Fría and Encontrados to mobilize the great crops of Tachira coffee.
[[File:Marcos Pérez Jiménez 1952.JPG|thumb|200px|Marcos Pérez Jiménez in 1952]]
In 1899, Cipriano Castro began the invasion of Venezuela from the State of Táchira with an armed group that confronted the regime of Ignacio Andrade. The successive presidents of Venezuela of Tachira origin initiate a process of greater integration of the state to the country with the construction of better communication routes and the implementation of control measures on the agricultural trade of the state that was almost totally exported.
Táchira State plays an important role in the early parts of Venezuelan history. This state produced more presidents than any other state during the 20th century: [[Cipriano Castro]], [[Juan Vicente Gómez]], [[Marcos Pérez Jiménez]], [[Isaías Medina Angarita]], [[Eleazar López Contreras]], [[Carlos Andrés Pérez]], and [[Ramón José Velásquez]].

At the end of the 19th century, the people of Táchira State were tired of being left out of the main country's decisions. Consequently, a group of men decided to start a revolution called the "Revolución Restauradora" (The Restorative Revolution). The idea was to take power and enhance the importance of the Andean Region in the country. It was led by Cipriano Castro and was successful.

Until the start of the 20th century, it was highly difficult traveling between Táchira State and others and even within the state itself. This condition led to cultural differences between the people of Táchira and those from the rest of Venezuela. The former were more influenced by Colombian culture, a more accessible region through Norte de Santander province.

===Territorial History===
[[File:Provincia Merida.jpg|thumb|Táchira as part of the Province of Mérida in 1840]]
*In 1856 it was part of the Province of Táchira within the territories of La Grita, Lobatera, San Antonio and San Cristóbal.
*In 1863 it acquired the category of State, a fact that was ratified in 1864 when it became part, as an independent state, of the United States of Venezuela.
*Between 1867 and 1868 it was part of the State of Zulia.
*In 1881, when the country was divided into 9 states, it became part, together with Guzmán (Mérida) and Trujillo, of the Great State of Los Andes.
*In 1899, the State of Los Andes was dissolved and Táchira recovered its status as an independent State, which it maintains to this day.
*It has remained a state since 1899, although like other states in Venezuela it did not achieve full autonomy until the early 1990s.

==Geography==
Táchira State is located in the Andes. Its highest point is La Montaña el Pulpito, which about 3995 meters above the sea level. Táchira's population is mainly located in San Cristóbal, the most important and prosperous city of this state. Tariba, Rubio, Colon, and La Grita are also other important urban centers in this state.
[[File:Vegetación Borotareña..JPG|thumb|Forest in the Borotá Mountains, Municipality  Lobatera]]
[[File:Cascada El Venteadero.jpg|thumb|200px|Venteadero waterfall.]]
It has international borders with [[Colombia]] in the west and south with [[Norte de Santander Department]]. [[Zulia (state)|Zulia]] and [[Mérida (state)|Mérida]] States lie to the north, and [[Barinas (state)|Barinas]] and [[Apure (state)|Apure]] States lie to the east.

The main peaks are:<ref>[http://www.rena.edu.ve/venezuela/tachgeo.html Geografía de Táchira<!-- Título generado por un bot -->]</ref>

* The Pulpit: 3,912 m
* Moor Battalion: 3,507 m
* The Tama: 3,450 m
* Moor La Negra: 3,450 m
* Moor The Zumbador: 2,850 m

Crossed by the extension of the Andes mountain range from south to northwest, it divides the state into three different regions with a particular climate:

*Mountain circuit; in this region are the main urban settlements in the state, the climate is temperate at high altitude8 in most of the region and high moorland at elevations above 3000 meters above sea level, with slight variations throughout the year, has a clear rainy season from May to October. The orography is uneven and influenced by the course of numerous rivers and streams that form valleys at the base of the mountains, as an example the capital city is settled on the valley of the river Torbes, this area represents most of the surface of the state. The main cities located in this area are San Cristóbal, Táriba, Michelena, Rubio and La Grita.
*Pan-American circuit: this zone is located mainly in the north of the state, it shares the climatic characteristics of the southern region of the lake (of Maracaibo), with a tropical jungle climate, high rainfall and high temperatures. This region is one of the main centers of livestock production in Venezuela. It is on the border of the states of Zulia and Mérida. The main populations of this region are: La Fría, La Tendida and Coloncito.
*Llanos region: a small part of the Venezuelan plains are briefly located southeast of the state of Táchira, on the border with the states of Apure and Barinas, the climate is tropical savannah, with less humidity than in the Pan-American zone, it is also a region of high livestock production. Its main populations are: La Pedrera, El Piñal and Abejales.

===Relief===
Its territory has an area of 11,100 km2, where the Andean physiographic character predominates, with heights above 2,000 m. The mountainous relief is the southern continuation of the Merida mountain range, which penetrates from the north in a southwesterly direction, exceeding 4,000 m in the La Negra moor.
[[File:Tepuis del tama.jpg|thumb|Mountain formations, El Tamá National Park, Táchira State]]
In the extreme southwest, the Táchira depression was formed, which includes the tectonic trench through which the river of the same name runs and the entire relatively low area located between this trench and the valleys of the Lobaterita, the Torbes Medio and the Quinimarí Medio. The depression of the Torbes River separates the main range of the Mérida Range from the Tamá Range. During the Tertiary period, the uplifts of failed blocks formed deep valleys like those of the Uribante and Torbes rivers, with very steep slopes. In addition, there are relatively open basins with gently sloping terrain (San Cristóbal-Táriba-Rubio). The northern slopes come into contact with the lowlands located south of Lake Maracaibo, with large marshy areas, while the southeastern sector, from the eastern slope of the Uribante branch, is a transition zone between the piedmont (the lowlands of the mountainous formation) and the western high plains.

===Climate===
The climate presents great variations, mainly due to the modifications by the height, in populations of the route to the plain, in the piedmont (El Piñal, San Joaquin de Navay among others), can reach temperatures of 30&nbsp;°C like in the Pan-American route (La Fría, Coloncito). In the capital, San Cristóbal, the average daytime temperature is 24&nbsp;°C and the nighttime temperature is 18&nbsp;°C. However, in cities like Pregonero, El Cobre, La Grita and others located at higher altitudes, the temperature is considerably lower (up to 10&nbsp;°C).

===Vegetation===
[[File:Descendiendo de La Verde..JPG|thumb|Juan Pablo Peñaloza National Park]]
The mountain vegetation includes specimens such as the Lasso pine and eucalyptus. The apamates and the creole cedar are abundant. Mangos, guamas, pomarrosas, guavas and other fruit trees are common in most of the state.

===Hydrography===
The hydrography is varied, there are several rivers of considerable course; the Torbes river, the Caparo river, the Uribante and the Doradas rivers among others, there are also some lakes and reservoirs, like the Uribante reservoir, the Caparo reservoir, the Garcia lagoon, the Rosal lagoon, the Ríobobo lagoon, among others.

[[File:S4031477.JPG|thumb|Laguna Grande]]

===Extreme geographical landmarks===
Far North, confluence of the Rio Grande with the Rio Escalante (Pan-American); Far South, confluence of the Rio Burgua with the Los Pensamientos stream (Fernández Feo); Far East, confluence of the Rio Doradas (Cauce Viejo) with the Rio Caparo (Libertador); Far West, eastern bank of the Rio Táchira in front of the Cerrito, village Sabana Larga (Pedro María Ureña). Distance between the extreme points of the State: north-south, 147.88&nbsp;km; east-west: 129.03&nbsp;km.

===Geology===
The Tachira Andes were formed during the Eocene period (between 56 million and 40 million years ago approximately), when the Nazca tectonic plate and the Caribbean plate began to slowly slide under the South American plate, raising older formations and bending the sedimentary and igneous rocks that form today's mountains (several of the highest peaks and moors in the State of Tachira are from the Phanerozoic eon, from the Precambrian period, about 539 million years ago).<ref>{{cite web |title=Stratigraphic Chart 2022 |url=https://stratigraphy.org/ICSchart/ChronostratChart2022-02.pdf |publisher=International Stratigraphic Commission | date=February 2022  |access-date=25 April 2022}}</ref>

The tectonic forces generated by this collision created: the shapes of the highest mountains and peaks (El Pico El Púlpito, 3,912 m, in the northeastern end, and Cerro El Cobre, 3,612 m, in the southwestern end. Both are known as 'The Guardian Pillars of the Tachira'); a tectonic depression (known as the Tachira Depression, from the Pliocene); intramountain areas surrounded by higher ground, known as valleys (from the Pleistocene era). These are where the largest towns and cities are located); and the plains or lowlands of the north - lakes or the lake - and the south of the state - river plains - (areas of piedmont formed between the Miocene and Pliocene).

*Highest point: El Púlpito Peak (3,912 m, Páramo de Batallón Mountain Range, Jáuregui and Uribante Municipalities).
==Government and politics==
{{See also|Cabinet of Venezuela#Federal Council of Government}}
The State is autonomous and equal in political terms to the rest of Venezuela, its administration and public powers are organized through the Constitution of the State of Táchira, approved by the Legislative Council and published in the extraordinary official gazette of the State of Táchira, number 778, on February 9, 2001.
[[File:PLAZA BOLIVAR LIBERT..jpg|thumb|Bolivar Square, Libertador Municipality]]

===Executive power===
It is composed of the Governor of Táchira and a group of state secretaries. The Governor is elected by the people by direct and secret vote for a period of four years and has the possibility of re-election for equal periods and a recall referendum in the middle of his term, being in charge of the state administration.

The State chooses its own Legislative Council as well as a Governor who is the Chief Executive of the State and is elected every 4 years; as of 1989, before that year he was elected by the President in office, his last Governor appointed by President Carlos Andrés Peréz, was Governor Jorge Enrique Romero, since 1989 he is chosen under direct elections, the current Governor Laidy Gómez is elected for the period (2017 - 2021) with the support of her party AD and other political organizations related to the Venezuelan opposition.

===Legislative Council===

The State Legislature is the responsibility of the unicameral Legislative Council of the State of Táchira, elected by the people by direct and secret vote every (4) four years, and they may be re-elected for new consecutive periods, under a system of proportional representation of the population of the State and its municipalities. The State has 13 legislators.
[[File:Politachira (PNB2011).svg|thumb|250px|Táchira State Police Logo]]

===State Police===

The state of Táchira, in accordance with Article 164 of the Venezuelan Constitution and Article 45 of the Constitution of the state of Táchira of 2014, has its own police force, called Politáchira, created in July 1960. Its functions are regulated by state and national laws, namely the Law of the Autonomous Institute of Police of the State of Táchira, the former; and the Organic Law of the Police Service, the latter. It reports to the Secretariat of State Security and is primarily responsible for regional security.

Like the other 23 federal entities of Venezuela, the State maintains control over own police force, which is supported and complemented by the [[Venezuelan police|National Police]] and the [[Venezuelan National Guard]].

===State Capital===
The city of San Cristóbal is the capital of the state. It is an important economic pole for the country since it is located in the Colombian-Venezuelan border axis and, therefore, it is a commercial city where small and medium entrepreneurs develop important commercial transactions. It has a metropolitan population that exceeds 400,000 inhabitants. Its topography extends under a succession of river terraces and has an average temperature of 23&nbsp;°C.
