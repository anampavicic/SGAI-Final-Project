In 1999, the city's historic centre was added to the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s and in 2010 the designation was expanded to include [[Eggenberg Palace, Graz|Eggenberg Palace]] ({{langx|de|Schloss Eggenberg}}) on the western edge of the city. Graz was designated the [[Cultural Capital of Europe]] in 2003 and became a City of Culinary Delights in 2008.

==Etymology==
The name of the city, Graz, formerly spelled '''Gratz'''<ref>{{Cite EB9|wstitle= Gratz |volume= 11 |page= 63}}</ref> and also formlerly known as '''Grätz''', most likely stems from the Slavic {{lang|sla|gradec/gradac}}, which means "small castle". Some [[archeological site|archaeological finds]] point to the erection of a small castle by [[Alpine Slavs|Alpine Slavic]] people,<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ilyK1_1f0zYC&q=graz+castle+fortification&pg=PA126 |title=Historical Dictionary of Austria |last=Fichtner |first=Paula Sutter |date=11 June 2009 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810863101 |language=en}}</ref> who settled in the region after the Barbarian invasions drove out the original Celts, as well as the Romans. In literary [[Slovene language|Slovene]], {{lang|sl|gradec}} still means "small castle", forming a [[hypocoristic]] derivative of Proto-West-South Slavic *gradьcъ, which descends via [[liquid metathesis]] from [[Common Slavic]] *gardьcъ and via the Slavic third [[Palatalization (sound change)|palatalisation]] from [[Proto-Slavic]] *gardiku, originally denoting "small town, settlement". The name thus follows the common South Slavic pattern for naming settlements as ''[[Grad (Slavic settlement)|grad]]''. Despite the Slavic root of the name, however, the city of Graz was founded by Bavarian settlers who arrived shortly after the Slavs, with which they intermixed. The city's name first appears in records in 1128, a record of 'Grez' from 1091 is disputed. 

== Geography ==
{{stack|
[[File:Historic City Center of Graz.jpg|thumb|Aerial photograph showing the historic centre of Graz]]
}}
Graz is situated on both sides of the river [[Mur (river)|Mur]] in southeast Austria. It is about {{cvt|150|km}} southwest of Vienna (''Wien''). The nearest larger [[urban centre]] is [[Maribor]] (''Marburg'') in Slovenia, which is about {{cvt|50|km}} to the south. Graz is the capital of Styria and the largest city in the federal state, a green and heavily forested region on the eastern edge of the [[Alps]]. It is located in the Graz Basin and surrounded by mountains and hills to the north, east and west. The city centre sits at an elevation of {{cvt|353|m}}, the highest point is Plabutsch mountain with {{cvt|754|m}} at the western border. The mountain [[Schöckl]] is just a few kilometres to the north and surmounts the city by {{cvt|1100|m}}.

The oldest settlement on the ground of the modern city of Graz dates back to the [[Copper Age]]. However, no historical continuity exists of a settlement before the Middle Ages. The city was originally called "Bayrischgraz" or "Bavarian Graz" (i.e. German Graz) by the German founders to distinguish it from the elder "Windischgraz" or "Slovenian Graz". Bavarian Graz, however, soon eclipsed its Slovenian counterpart and henceforth Graz always referred to the German one.

During the 12th century, dukes under [[Babenberg]] rule made the town into an important commercial center. Later, Graz came under the rule of the [[Habsburg]]s and, in 1281, gained special privileges from King [[Rudolf I of Germany|Rudolph I]].

In the 14th century, Graz became the city of residence of the [[Inner Austria]]n line of the Habsburgs. The royalty lived in the [[Schlossberg (Graz)|Schlossberg]] castle and from there ruled [[Styria (duchy)|Styria]], [[Carinthia (duchy)|Carinthia]], most of today's Slovenia, and parts of Italy ([[Carniola]], [[Gorizia and Gradisca]], [[Trieste]]).

In the 16th century, the city's design and planning were primarily controlled by Italian Renaissance architects and artists. One of the most famous buildings representative of this style is the [[Landhaus]], designed by [[Domenico dell'Allio]], and used by the local rulers as a governmental headquarters.

The [[University of Graz]] was founded by Archduke [[Charles II of Austria|Karl II]] in 1585, it is the city's oldest university. For most of its existence, it was controlled by the [[Catholic Church]], and was closed in 1782 by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] in an attempt to gain state control over educational institutions. Joseph II transformed it into a lyceum where civil servants and medical personnel were trained. In 1827 it was re-established as a university by Emperor [[Franz I of Austria|Franz I]], and was named 'Karl-Franzens Universität' or 'Charles-Francis University' in English. More than 30,000 students are currently enrolled at this university.

Astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] lived in Graz for a short period beginning in 1594. He worked as district mathematician and taught at the Lutheran school, but still found time to study astronomy. He left Graz for [[Prague]] in 1600 when [[Protestant]]s were banned from the city.

[[Ludwig Boltzmann]] was Professor for Mathematical Physics from 1869 to 1890. During that time, [[Nikola Tesla]] studied electrical engineering at the [[Graz University of Technology|Polytechnic]] in 1875.

Nobel laureate [[Otto Loewi]] taught at the University of Graz from 1909 until 1938. [[Ivo Andrić]], the 1961 Nobel Prize for Literature laureate obtained his doctorate at the University of Graz. [[Erwin Schrödinger]] was briefly chancellor of the University of Graz in 1936.

Graz is centrally located within today's ''[[States of Austria|Bundesland]]'' (state) of [[Styria]], or ''Steiermark'' in German. ''Mark'' is an old German word indicating a large area of land used as a defensive border, in which the peasantry is taught how to organize and fight in the case of an invasion. With a strategic location at the head of the open and fertile Mur valley, Graz was historically a target of invaders, such as the Hungarians under [[Matthias Corvinus]] in 1481, and the [[Ottoman Turks]] in 1529 and 1532. Apart from the [[Riegersburg Castle]], the Schlossberg was the only fortification in the region that never fell to the Ottoman Turks. Graz is home to [[Landeszeughaus|the region's provincial armory]], which is the world's largest historical collection of late medieval and Renaissance weaponry. It has been preserved since 1551, and displays over 30,000 items.

From the earlier part of the 15th century, Graz was the residence of the younger branch of the Habsburgs, which succeeded to the imperial throne in 1619 in the person of [[Emperor Ferdinand II]], who moved the capital to Vienna. New fortifications were built on the Schlossberg at the end of the 16th century. [[Napoleon]]'s army occupied Graz in 1797 and, in 1809 the city withstood another assault by the French army. During this attack, the commanding officer in the fortress was ordered to defend it with about 900 men against Napoleon's army of about 3,000. He successfully defended the Schlossberg against eight attacks, but they were forced to give up after the Grande Armée occupied Vienna and the Emperor ordered to surrender. Following the defeat of Austria by Napoleonic forces at the [[Battle of Wagram]] in 1809, the fortifications were demolished using explosives, as stipulated in the Peace of [[Schönbrunn Palace|Schönbrunn]] of the same year. The belltower (Glockenturm)<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://austria-forum.org/af/AEIOU/Graz_Glockenturm |title=Graz Glockenturm|website=Austria-Forum|language=de|access-date=26 November 2019}}</ref> and the civic clock tower (''Uhrturm''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://austria-forum.org/af/AEIOU/Graz_Uhrturm |title=Graz Uhrturm|website=Austria-Forum|language=de|access-date=26 November 2019}}</ref> which is a leading tourist attraction and serves as a symbol for Graz, were spared after the citizens of Graz paid a ransom for their preservation.<ref name="graz-sh"/>

Archduke [[Charles II of Austria|Karl II]] of Inner Austria had 20,000 [[Protestant]] books burned in the square of what is now a mental hospital, and succeeded in returning Styria to the authority of the [[Holy See]]. [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand]] was born in Graz in what is now the Stadtmuseum (city museum).

On 2 April 1945, while the heaviest Allied bomb raid of Graz occurred, the Gestapo and Waffen-SS committed a massacre against resistance fighters, Hungarian-Jewish forced laborers, and POWs at the SS barracks at Graz-Wetzelsdorf.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.oeaw.ac.at/41tage/41-tage-kriegsende-1945-english |title=41 Tage.

== Climate ==
Graz has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''),<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=4211&cityname=Graz,+Styria,+Austria&units= |title=Graz, Austria Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase) |website=Weatherbase|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref> but due to the 0&nbsp;°C isotherm, the same occurs in a borderline [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfb'') according to the [[Köppen climate classification]].

The weather in Graz is thus influenced by the Mediterranean, and it has more hours of sunshine per year than Vienna or Salzburg and also less wind or rain. Graz lies in a basin that is only open to the south, causing the climate to be warmer than would be expected at that latitude.<ref>Graz-Universität Klimadaten</ref> Plants are found in Graz that normally grow much further south.

==Slovene minority in Graz==
Graz, being the capital of the then multiethnic Duchy of Styria, was also a centre of [[Slovenes|Slovene]] culture, especially from the establishment of the University of Graz in 1586 until the establishment of the [[University of Ljubljana]] in 1919. In 1574, the {{Interlanguage link|Compendium Catechismi in Slauonica lingua{{!}}first Slovene Catholic book|sl|3=Compendium Catechismi Catholici in Slavonica lingua per Questiones in gratiam Catholicae iuventutis propositum}} was published in Graz, and in 1592, [[Hieronymus Megiser]] published in Graz the book ''[[Dictionarium quatuor linguarum]]'', the first multilingual dictionary of Slovene.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.dlib.si/details/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-H9LFKLTH/? |title=Primeri nekaj sklanjatev in spregatev v Megiserjevem Dictionarium quatuor linguarum 1592 |trans-title=The Concise Grammar of Four Languages in Megiser's 1592 Dictionary |language=sl |journal=Jezikoslovni Zapiski |volume=13 |issue=1/2 |year=2007 |publisher=Inštitut za slovenski jezik Frana Ramovša, ZRC SAZU |id={{COBISS |ID=26967085}} |pages=23–32 |issn=0354-0448}}</ref>

In the 19th century the student associations in Graz were a crucible of Slovene nationalism and some Slovene students there were more nationally aware than other Slovenes.

==Main sights==
{{wide image|Graz Austria pano from Schlossberg.jpg|700px|A panoramic view of the historic centre from the Castle Hill (Schlossberg)}}
For the year that Graz was [[Cultural Capital of Europe]], new structures were erected. The [[Kunsthaus Graz|Graz Museum of Contemporary Art]] (German: Kunsthaus) was designed by [[Peter Cook (architect)|Peter Cook]] and [[Colin Fournier]] and is situated next to the Mur river. The [[Murinsel|Island in the Mur]] is a floating platform made of steel. It was designed by American architect [[Vito Acconci]] and contains a café, an open-air theatre and a playground.

The historic centre was added to the UNESCO [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage List]] in 1999<ref name="graz-sh">{{cite web |url=http://www.graz.at/cms/ziel/4519230/EN/ |title=A Short History of the City |website=graz.at |publisher=Stadt Graz – Magistratsdirektion, Abteilung für Öffentlichkeitsarbeit. |location=Graz|access-date=25 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209042512/http://www.graz.at/cms/ziel/4519230/EN/|archive-date=9 December 2013|url-status=dead }}</ref> due to the harmonious co-existence of typical buildings from different epochs and in different architectural styles. Situated in a cultural borderland between Central Europe, Italy and the Balkan States, Graz absorbed various influences from the neighbouring regions and thus received its exceptional townscape. Today the historic centre consists of over 1,000 buildings, their age ranging from Gothic to contemporary.

The most important sights in the historic centre are:
* Town Hall (Rathaus).
* The [[Schlossberg (Graz)|Castle Hill]] (German: Schlossberg), a hill dominating the historic centre ({{cvt|475|m|2}} high), site of a demolished fortress, with views over Graz.
* The Clock Tower (Uhrturm) is a symbol of Graz, at the top of the Castle Hill.
* The New Gallery (Neue Galerie), a museum of art.
* The [[Schloßbergbahn (Graz)|Castle Hill funicular]] (Schlossbergbahn), a funicular railway on the Castle Hill's slope.
* The seat of Styria's provincial parliament (Landhaus), a palace in Lombardic style. It is one of the most important examples of Renaissance architecture in Austria and was built by Italian architect [[Domenico dell'Allio]] between 1557 and 1565.
* The [[Landeszeughaus|Armoury]] (Landeszeughaus) is the largest of its kind in the world.
* The [[Graz Opera|Opera House]] (Opernhaus), the principal venue for opera, ballet, and operetta performances. It is the 2nd largest opera house in Austria.
* The Theatre (Schauspielhaus), Graz's principal theatre for productions of plays.
* The [[Graz Cathedral|Cathedral]] (Dom), a rare monument of Gothic architecture. Once, there were many frescos on the outer walls; today, only a few remain, like the ''Landplagenbild'' ("picture of plagues") painted in 1485, presumably by [[Thomas von Villach]]. The three plagues it depicts are locusts, pestilence and the invasion of the Turks, all of them striking the town in 1480. It features the oldest painted view of Graz.
* The mausoleum of Emperor [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] next to the cathedral, the most important building of [[Mannerism]] in Graz. It includes both the grave where Ferdinand II and his wife are buried, and a church dedicated to St Catherine of Alexandria.
* The City Park (Stadtpark), located in the middle of the city centre during the Habsburg monarchy. It was designed by German architect Johannes Schirgie von Premstätten-Tobelbad. During the COVID-19 pandemic eccentric parties were celebrated which were later dissolved by the police. The responsible,{{Citation needed|date=September 2022}} Jonas Fabio Cristo Pinter, an Italian club owner, was arrested and the partying stopped. The City Park (Stadtpark) should not be confused with a similarly named shopping centre in Graz, called Citypark.
* The Castle (Burg), with a Gothic double-helix staircase, built between 1438 and 1453 by Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]], because the old castle on the Castle Hill was too small and uncomfortable. The Castle remained the residence of the Inner Austrian Court until 1619. Today, it serves as residence for the Styrian government.
* The Painted House (Gemaltes Haus) in Herrengasse 3. It is completely covered with frescos (painted in 1742 by Johann Mayer).
* The [[Kunsthaus Graz|Graz Museum of Contemporary Art]] (Kunsthaus)
* The [[Murinsel|Island in the Mur]] (Murinsel), an artificial island in the Mur river.
* Buildings, inner courtyards (e. g. Early Renaissance courtyard of the ''Former House of Teutonic Knights'' in Sporgasse 22) and roofscape of the old town.

=== Outside the historic city centre ===
[[File:Graz Schloss Eggenberg front facade.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schloss Eggenberg (Graz)|Eggenberg Palace]]]]
* [[Schloss Eggenberg (Graz)|Eggenberg Palace]] (Schloss Eggenberg) a baroque palace on the western edge of Graz with State rooms and museum. In 2010 it was added to the existing World Heritage site of the historic centre of Graz.
* The [[Mariatrost Basilica]] (Basilika Mariatrost) a late Baroque church, on the eastern edge of Graz.
* The [[Herz-Jesu-Kirche (Graz)|Jesus's Heart Church]] (Herz-Jesu-Kirche) is the largest church in Graz with the third highest spire in Austria, built in Gothic Revival style by Daniel Schmidbauer (Austrian politician and doctor).
* The Calvary Hill (Kalvarienberg) in the Gösting area of Graz with a 17th-century calvary and church.
* The Graz University Hospital is the largest hospital in Graz and one of the largest hospitals in [[Austria]]. It is the largest Jugendstil building complex in Austria and was built between 1904 and 1912. It is run by the federal state Styria and is one of the most renowned hospitals in Austria and Central Europe.
* The [[Gösting Castle|Gösting Ruin]] (Ruine Gösting), a ruin of a hilltop castle on the city's northwestern edge, and Plabutsch/Fürstenstand, behind Eggenberg Palace, with a hilltop restaurant and viewing tower, as well as [[Buchkogel (Plabutsch)|Buchkogel]]/Kronprinz-Rudolf-Warte are viewpoints for vistas of the city.

=== Greater Graz area ===
* '''Österreichisches Freilichtmuseum Stübing''', an open-air museum containing old farmhouses/farm buildings from all over Austria reassembled in historic setting.
* '''[[Lurgrotte]]''', the most extensive cave system in Austria.
* '''[[Piber Federal Stud|Lipizzanergestüt Piber]]''', [[Lipizzaner]] stud at [[Piber]] where the famous horses are bred.
* The '''Steirische Weinstraße''' is a wine-growing region south of Graz, also known as the "Styrian Tuscany".
* '''Thermenregion''', spa region east of Graz.
* '''[[Riegersburg Castle]]''', a mighty fortress that was never taken. It was a bastion against Turkish invasions

==Politics==
[[File:Gemeindesrat of Graz elections, 1945-2021.png|thumb|400px|Municipal election results since 1945.]]
[[File:Rathaus Graz (18305161105).jpg|thumb|Graz City Hall]]
For much of its post-war history Graz was a stronghold of the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria]] (SPÖ), but since the late 1990s the party has lost most of its support on a local level. It was overtaken by the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP) in 2003, which remained the largest party in the city council (''Gemeinderat'') until 2021. With the decline of the SPÖ, the [[Communist Party of Austria]] (KPÖ) has become highly popular in Graz, despite its negligible presence on a national level. The party placed third with 20.8% of votes in the 2003 local election, which has been attributed to the popularity of local leader Ernest Kaltenegger. It fell to 11.2% in 2008, and recovered under new leader Elke Kahr, becoming the second most popular party in Graz with 19.9% in 2012 and 20.3% in 2017. The KPÖ's popularity in Graz allowed them to enter the Styrian provincial parliament in the [[2005 Styrian state election|2005 election]], marking their first appearance in an Austrian provincial parliament in 35 years; they have retained their seats in the subsequent 2010, 2015, and 2019 elections.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/europa/oesterreich-wuerschtl-statt-weltrevolution-12892839.html |title=Klutz instead of World Revolution |newspaper=Faz.net |date=19 April 2014 |publisher=[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]] |last1=Löwenstein |first1=Stephan}}</ref> The 2021 municipal election saw a collapse in the ÖVP's popularity, allowing the KPÖ, once again led by [[Elke Kahr]], to become the largest party with 29% of votes.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Communist Party Just Won the Elections in Austria's Second-Biggest City |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2021/09/communist-party-of-austria-kpo-graz-election-victory-red-fortress |website=Jacobin |access-date=30 September 2021 |date=27 September 2021}}</ref> She was subsequently elected mayor in November, leading a coalition with the Greens and SPÖ.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://steiermark.orf.at/stories/3130354/|title=Livestream: Elke Kahr is Graz mayor|date=17 November 2021|language=de|website=[[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dw.com/en/austrian-city-swears-in-first-ever-communist-mayor/a-59849044|title=Austrian city swears in first-ever communist mayor|date=17 November 2021|website=[[Deutsche Welle]]}}</ref>

===Architecture===
The city centre and the adjacent districts are characterized by the historic residential buildings and churches. In the outer districts buildings are predominantly of the architectural styles from the second half of the 20th century.

In 1965 the Graz School (''Grazer Schule'') was founded. Several buildings around the universities are of this style, e.g. the green houses by Volker Giencke and the ''RESOWI'' Centre by Günther Domenig.

Before Graz became European Capital of Culture in 2003, several new projects were realized, such as the ''Stadthalle'' - a multifunctional space for e.g. conventions and concerts -, the Children's Museum (''Kindermuseum''), the ''Helmut-List-Halle'', the Museum of Contemporary Art (''Kunsthaus'') and the Island in the Mur (''Murinsel'').

=== Styriarte ===
Graz hosts the annual festival of classical music [[Styriarte]], founded in 1985 to tie conductor [[Nikolaus Harnoncourt]] closer to his hometown. Events have been held at different venues in Graz and in the surrounding region.

=== Dialect ===
Referred to as ''Steirisch'' by locals, Graz belongs to the [[Austro-Bavarian]] region of dialects, more specifically a mix of [[Central Bavarian]] in the western part of [[Styria]] and [[Southern Bavarian]] in the eastern part.<ref>{{cite web |title=Steirische Sprache |url=https://www.steiermark.com/de/urlaub/kultur-in-stadt-und-land/volkskultur-brauchtum/steirische-sprache |website=Steiermark: Das offizielle Tourismusportal der Steiermark |publisher=Medieninhaber und Herausgeber sowie Dienstanbieter Steirische Tourismus GmbH |access-date=8 July 2020}}</ref> The Grazer [[ORF (broadcaster)|ORF]], the Graz subsidiary of Austrian Broadcasting Corporation, launched an initiative in 2008 called ''Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt'' to highlight the numerous dialects of Graz and Styria in general and to cultivate the pride many Styrians hold for their local culture. Two reasons for a melding of these dialects with [[Standard German]]: the influence of television and radio bringing Standard German into the home and the industrialization causing the disappearance of the single farmer since the farming communities are seen as the true keepers of dialect speaking.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Jontes |first1=Günther |title=Scho wieda Steirisch g'redt |url=http://static2.orf.at/vietnam2/files/stmkmagazin/200831/scho_wieda_steirisch_gredt_16997.pdf |website=ORF St Radio Steiermark |publisher=ORF Steiermark |access-date=8 July 2020 |archive-date=18 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210818103713/http://static2.orf.at/vietnam2/files/stmkmagazin/200831/scho_wieda_steirisch_gredt_16997.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Transport ==
[[File:Tramway graz23.jpg|thumb|right|Tram at Jakomini square ([[Jakominiplatz]])]]
[[File:16-07-05-Flughafen-Graz-RR2 0347.jpg|thumb|[[Graz Airport]]]]
An extensive [[public transport]] network makes Graz an easy city to navigate without a car. The city has a comprehensive bus network, complementing the [[Trams in Graz|Graz tram network]], which has six lines. Four lines pass through the underground tram stop at the central train station (Hauptbahnhof) and on to the city centre before branching out. Furthermore, there are eight night-time bus routes, although these run only at weekends and on evenings preceding public holidays.

The [[Schlossbergbahn (Graz)|Castle Hill funicular (Schlossbergbahn)]], and the [[Castle Hill lift (Schlossberg lift)]], a vertical lift, link the city centre to the [[Schlossberg (Graz)|Castle Hill (Schlossberg)]].
[[File:Graz Aufnahmsgebäude Hauptbahnhof-4380.jpg|thumb|[[Graz Hauptbahnhof|Graz Central Railway Station]]]]
From the central train station ([[Graz Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]]), regional trains link to most of Styria. Direct trains run to most major cities nearby including [[Vienna]], [[Salzburg]], [[Innsbruck]], [[Maribor]] and [[Ljubljana]] in [[Slovenia]], [[Zagreb]] in [[Croatia]], [[Budapest]] in [[Hungary]], [[Prague]] and [[Brno]] in the [[Czech Republic]], [[Zürich]] in [[Switzerland]], as well as [[Munich]], [[Stuttgart]], [[Heidelberg]], and [[Frankfurt]] in [[Germany]]. Trains for Vienna leave every hour. In recent years many railway stations within the city limits and in the suburbs have been rebuilt or modernised and are now part of the [[Styria S-Bahn]], a commuter train service connecting the city with its suburban area and towns nearby.

[[Graz Airport]] is located about {{cvt|10|km|0}} south of the city centre and is accessible by bus, railway, taxi and car. Direct destinations include Berlin, [[Düsseldorf]], Frankfurt, Hamburg, Munich, Vienna and Zurich.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flughafen-graz.at/en/flug/flug-reiseinfo/destinationen.html |title=Flughafen Graz :: Destinations|access-date=21 August 2015|archive-date=7 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907231342/http://www.flughafen-graz.at/en/flug/flug-reiseinfo/destinationen.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2021 a two-line [[rapid transit|metro]] system was proposed for Graz,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/metros/two-line-automated-metro-proposed-for-graz/58606.article |title=Two-line automated metro proposed for Graz |website=Metro Report International |date=1 March 2021 |accessdate=18 April 2021}}</ref> which would make Graz the second Austrian city with a rapid transit system after Vienna.

Furthermore, several non-emergency ambulances (''KTW – Krankentransportwagen'') and a [[Intensive care unit#Mobile intensive care unit|Mobile Intensive Care Unit (MICU)]] are operated by the [[Red Cross]] to transport non-emergency patients to and between hospitals. In addition to the Red Cross, the Labourers'-Samaritan-Alliance (Arbeiter-Samariter-Bund Österreichs), the Austrian organisation of the [[Order of Malta Ambulance Corps]] (Malteser Hospitaldienst Austria) and the Green Cross (''Grünes Kreuz'') operate ambulances (''KTW'') for non-emergency patient transport.
