'''Angren''' ({{langx|uz|Angren/Ангрен}}; {{langx|ru|Ангрен}}; {{langx|tg|Ангрен}}) is a district-level city in [[Tashkent Region]], eastern [[Uzbekistan]].<ref name=class>{{cite web|url=https://stat.uz/uploads/docs/soato(mhobt)_2020.xlsx|title=Classification system of territorial units of the Republic of Uzbekistan|language=uz, ru|date=July 2020|publisher=The State Committee of the Republic of Uzbekistan on statistics}}</ref> The city is located on the [[Angren River]] {{convert|70|mi|km|abbr=on}} to the east of [[Tashkent]]. The City of Angren was created in 1946 from the villages of Jigariston, Jartepa, Teshiktosh, and Qoʻyxona which had emerged in the rich Angren coal basin during [[World War II]]. It has an area of {{cvt|150|km2}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://toshvilstat.uz/uz/rasmiy-statistika/demography-2|title=Toshkent viloyatining ma'muriy-hududiy bo'linishi|trans-title=Administrative-territorial division of the Tashkent Region|publisher=Tashkent regional department of statistics|lang=uz|type=PDF}}</ref> and the population of the city is 191,300 (2021).<ref name=toshvilstat/>

There were several large coal mines and factories in Angren during Soviet times. Following the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the USSR]], the majority of these factories were abandoned. A lack of professionals and machinery, mismanagement, and falling income levels — all contributed to this downfall. While Angren was once an important industrial center, the collapse caused it to turn into a ghost town for a while. However, in the recent days, Angren has developed and still is developing. 

Still, Angren has retained some of its industrial importance. The city is home to a once considerable and still functioning [[coal mining]] industry. It also has a large construction-materials industry, a [[rubber]] processing plant, and a [[power station]].
There are a few supermarkets across the town. Angren University was founded in January, 2023.

== History ==
The current name of the city is a [[Russification]] of the [[Persian language|Persian]] word {{transl|fa|ohangaron}} which means "blacksmiths."<ref name="OʻzME">{{cite encyclopedia | year = 2000–2005 | title = Angren | encyclopedia = Oʻzbekiston milliy ensiklopediyasi | location = Toshkent | language = uz }}</ref> In 1936, first geological explorations were carried out in the Angren Valley. In 1940, the first [[coal mine]] was built in the area and it became operational in 1942. In 1941, Angren and [[Tashkent]] were connected with a [[railway line]].

During [[World War II]], several settlements, namely, the villages of Jigariston, Jartepa, Teshiktosh, and Qoʻyxona grew up in the area. On June 13, 1946, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Uzbek SSR]] issued a decree to create the City of Angren from these settlements.<ref name=EB>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Angren|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/25244/Angren|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=7 May 2014}}</ref> In his book ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] mentioned Angren as one of the Soviet towns that grew up next to a [[gulag]] [[labor camp]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Solzhenitsyn|first1=Aleksandr|title=The Gulag Archipelago (1918-1956: An Experiment in Literary Investigation III-IV)|date=2006|publisher=U-Faktoriya|location=Yekaterinburg|page=457|url=http://www.solzhenitsyn.ru/proizvedeniya/arhipelag_gulag/arhipelag_gulag_tom2.pdf|access-date=20 January 2015|language=ru}}</ref>

Later it turned out that most of the city had been built above coal seams.<ref name="OʻzME"/> Therefore, in 1956 Angren was moved to a different area {{convert|7|–|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the south-west of its original location.

Angren was an important industrial city in the Soviet Union.<ref>{{cite web|title=Angren (City in the Uzbek SSR)|url=http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/bse/63851/%D0%90%D0%BD%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%BD|publisher=Akademik|access-date=21 January 2015|language=ru}}</ref> After the dissolution of the USSR, the majority of ethnic Russians and Tatars living in Angren left the city. There were many experienced workers among those who left. In the 1990s, almost all of the factories in the city were closed down as a result of a lack professionals, disruption of Soviet trade routes, ageing machinery, and mismanagement. Nowadays Angren is often referred to as a [[ghost town]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Volosevich|first1=Aleksey|title=Angren: The gloomy stability of Uzbekistan's small towns|url=http://www.fergananews.com/articles/8033|access-date=20 January 2015|work=Ferghana|date=30 January 2014|language=ru}}</ref>
