'''Yavatmal''' ({{audio|Yavatmal.ogg|pronunciation}} is a city and [[municipal council]] in the Indian [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Maharashtra]]. It is the administrative headquarters of [[Yavatmal District]]. Yavatmal is around 90&nbsp;km away from divisional headquarters [[Amravati, Maharashtra|Amravati]] while it is {{cvt|670|km}} away from the state capital [[Mumbai]] and 150&nbsp;km south west of [[Nagpur]].

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the [[Marathi language|Marathi]] ''Yavat'' (mountain) and ''mal'' (row). Another theory is {{citation needed span|date=September 2022|it might be derived from Yavateshwar (Lord Shiva) and Mal (one of the marathi word for Plateau)}} as the city is located on a plateau, which is comparatively higher altitude than its other tehsils.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2019}}
Formerly known as "Yeoti" or "Yeotmal", Yavatmal was the main town of the [[Berar Sultanate]] and according to old writings "the safest place in the world". The then region of Yavatmal (now Yavatmal district), was part of the dominion of [[Aladdin Hassan Bahman Shah]] who founded the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] in 1347. In 1572, [[Murtaza Shah]], ruler of the [[Ahmadnagar Sultanate]] (current day [[Ahmadnagar District]]), annexed the Yavatmal district. In 1596, [[Chand Bibi]], warrior queen of Ahmadnagar, ceded the district of Yavatmal to the [[Mughal Empire]], then rulers of a large part of India. Following the death of the sixth Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in 1707, Yavatmal was passed on to the [[Maratha Empire]]. When [[Raghoji I Bhonsle]] became ruler of the [[Nagpur kingdom]] in 1783, he included the Yavatmal district in his territory. After the [[British East India Company]] created [[Berar Province]] in 1853, Yavatmal became part of East Berar District in 1863 and later part of the South East Berar district—both districts of the [[Central Provinces and Berar]]. Yavatmal remained part of Madhya Pradesh until the 1956 reorganisation of states when it was transferred to the [[Bombay State]]. With the creation of the Maharashtra state on 1 May 1960, Yavatmal district became a part of the same.

Yavatmal Municipal Council was constituted in 1869 but was dissolved shortly thereafter. It was established again in 1894 and thus forms the oldest municipal council in the district. Mr. Eliot was first mayor and Lieutenant, W. Hege was deputy mayor. Govind Punaji Bari was the first Indian president of the Yavatmal Municipal council (2 January 1914 to 31 May 1932). The first elections conducted for the position of president of municipal council were held on 22 December 1934. Prior to that the same was appointed.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

The mini-train called ''Shakuntala'' is a historic remark built by the British government to transport cotton which is now closed.
