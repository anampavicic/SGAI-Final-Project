It comprises two provinces, [[Arica Province|Arica]] and [[Parinacota Province|Parinacota]]. It borders [[Peru]]'s [[Department of Tacna]] to the north, [[Bolivia]]'s [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]] and [[Oruro Department|Oruro]] departments to the east and Chile's [[Tarapacá Region]] to the south. Arica y Parinacota is the [[Ranked lists of Chilean regions#By area|5th smallest]], the [[Ranked lists of Chilean regions#By population|3rd least populous]] and the [[Ranked lists of Chilean regions#By population density|6th least densely populated]] of the regions of Chile. [[Arica]] is the region's capital and largest city.

The region was a former [[Tarapacá Province (Peru)|Peruvian province]], which was occupied by Chile under the 1883 [[Treaty of Ancón]] at the close of the [[War of the Pacific]], and then formally annexed in 1929 by the [[Treaty of Lima (1929)|Treaty of Lima]]. Following annexation, Arica y Parinacota went through a process of forced [[acculturation]] known as [[Chilenization]] with the aim of creating a dominance of Chilean traditions and culture.

==Administration==
In 2007, the region was subdivided to create the Arica y Parinacota region and the present day [[Tarapacá Region]] to the south. The region is further subdivided into two provinces: [[Arica Province|Arica]] and [[Parinacota Province|Parinacota]].

==Demography==
[[File:AricaViewCoast.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Arica]]]]

According to data from the 2017 Census of the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], the region is populated by 224,548 inhabitants. Its density reaches 13.3 inhabitants per km².

This region holds the largest population of [[Aymara people|Aymara]]<ref>{{cite web|website=transparencia.dgop.cl|access-date=28 August 2023
|url=http://transparencia.dgop.cl/OtrosAntecedentes/docs/Guia_asuntos_indigenas.pdf |title=De los pueblos indígenas de Chile|language=es}}</ref> and a significant number of immigrants from neighboring [[Peru]] and [[Bolivia]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.extranjeria.gob.cl/estadisticas-migratorias/ |title = Estadísticas Migratorias}}</ref> Included are those of Asian descent, such as Chinese and Japanese; and [[Arab]]s from [[Lebanon]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] and [[Syria]]. Most of the country's [[Afro-Chilean]]s live in the Arica province, descended from slaves in the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/w3-article-93990.html |title = Africana – Memoria Chilena, Biblioteca Nacional de Chile}}</ref> There are a large number of [[Romani people|Roma people]] or Gypsies in the Arica province as well, originated from Eastern Europe in the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.memoriachilena.gob.cl/602/articles-123219_recurso_2.pdf|title=Los Gitanos en Chile: de viajeros eternos a viajeros soñadores|language=es|author=María Paz Rubilar Donoso|website=memoriachilena.gob.cl|access-date=28 August 2023}}</ref>

At the level of cities, the most populated are: [[Arica]], with 175,441 inhabitants and [[Putre]], with 1235 inhabitants.

==Geography==
[[File:Chungara Lake and Volcan Sajama Chile Luca Galuzzi 2006.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Lauca National Park]]]]

The region lies within the [[Norte Grande]] (''Far North'') [[Natural regions of Chile|natural region]]. It combines deserts, green valleys, the steep and volcanic [[Andes]] mountains, and the [[Altiplano]] (high plain) to the east. A narrow coastal strip of low-lying land no more than {{convert|2|km|0}} wide separates the Pacific's [[Nazca Plate]] from the Andes. Its [[Parinacota (volcano)|Parinacota volcano]] is the region's highest elevation at {{convert|6348|m|0}} and lies on the northern border with Bolivia in [[Lauca National Park]].

==Hydrology==
The region's two main rivers are the [[Lauca River|Lauca]], which drains into Bolivia's Coipasa salt flat ([[Lago Coipasa]]), and the [[Lluta River|Lluta]], which flows into the Pacific Ocean. [[Lake Chungará]] at {{convert|4517|m|0}} above sea level ranks as one of the highest in the world.<ref name="CINVER-A&P"/>

==Climate==
A desert climate dominates the region. Near the coast, cloudiness can limit the temperature swing throughout the day, but in other drier areas, temperatures can vary greatly as is typical in deserts. A marginal desert region can be found over {{convert|3000|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, which sees milder temperatures and summer rains.<ref name="CINVER-A&P"/>

==Border dispute with Peru==
{{Main|Chilean–Peruvian maritime dispute}}

[[File:Maritime Claims of Peru and Ecuador.svg|thumb|Maritime claims of Ecuador and Peru, showing areas in dispute with Chile.]]

[[File:ICJ Peru Chile judgment map4.png|thumb|The maritime boundary between Chile and Peru as defined by the International Court of Justice on 27 January 2014.]]

On 26 January 2007, Peru's government issued a protest against Chile's demarcation of the coastal frontier the two countries share. According to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Peru)|Peruvian Foreign Ministry]], the Chilean legislatures had endorsed a plan regarding the Arica y Parinacota region which did not comply with the current established territorial demarcation. Moreover, it is alleged that the proposed Chilean law included an assertion of [[sovereignty]] over {{convert|19000|sqm|0|abbr=on}} of land in Peru's [[Department of Tacna]]. According to the Peruvian Foreign Ministry, Chile has defined a new region "without respecting the Concordia demarcation."<ref name="xinhua"/>

For its part, the Chilean government has asserted that the region in dispute is not a coastal site named Concordia, but instead refers to boundary stone No. 1, which is located to the northeast and 200 meters inland.<ref name="xinhua">{{cite web |title= Peru protests against Chile's new definition of territory |publisher= Xinhua People's Daily online |url= http://english.people.com.cn/200701/27/eng20070127_345352.html | access-date=27 January 2007}}</ref> A possible border dispute was averted when the Chilean Constitutional Court formally ruled on 26 January 2007, against the legislation. While agreeing with the court's ruling, the Chilean government reiterated its stance that the maritime borders between the two nations were not in question and have been formally recognized by the international community.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/27/america/LA-GEN-Chile-Peru-Border-Dispute.php |title=Chilean court ruling averts looming border dispute with Peru - International Herald Tribune |access-date=28 January 2007 |archive-date=29 January 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129103957/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/01/27/america/LA-GEN-Chile-Peru-Border-Dispute.php |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Peruvian government has stated that it might turn to the international court at [[The Hague]] to solve the dispute.<ref>{{cite web |title= Peru-Chile Sea Dispute May Go to The Hague |location= Lima |date= 27 January 2007 |publisher= Prensa Latina |url= http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B0717DC70-D950-4AC2-9D92-67B4B7D28892%7D&language=EN |access-date= 28 January 2007 |archive-date= 25 October 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081025124111/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B0717DC70-D950-4AC2-9D92-67B4B7D28892%7D&language=EN |url-status= dead }}</ref>

On 27 January 2014, in the final ruling of the [[International Court of Justice]] located in [[The Hague]], Peru gained some maritime territory. The maritime boundary extends only to 80 nautical miles off of the coast. From that point, the new border runs in a southwest direction to a point that is 200 miles equidistant from the coast of the two countries.

Under the ruling, Chile lost control over part of its formerly claimed maritime territory and gives additional maritime territory to Peru.

From the 27 January 2014 court press release: 

{{block quote|The Court concludes that the maritime boundary between the Parties starts at the intersection of the parallel of latitude passing through Boundary Marker No. 1 with the low-water line, and extends for 80 nautical miles along that parallel of latitude to Point A. From this point, the maritime boundary runs along the equidistance line to Point B, and then along the 200-nautical-mile limit measured from the Chilean baselines to Point C. In view of the circumstances of the case, the Court has defined the course of the maritime boundary between the Parties without determining the precise geographical co-ordinates.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/world-court-draws-new-peru-chile-maritime-border |title=World court draws new Peru-Chile maritime border |last1=CORDER |first1=MIKE |date=27 January 2014 |publisher=Associated Press |access-date=27 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/137/17928.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202143900/http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/137/17928.pdf |archive-date=2 February 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>}}
