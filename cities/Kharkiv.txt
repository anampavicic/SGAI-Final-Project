Kharkiv is the administrative centre of [[Kharkiv Oblast]] and [[Kharkiv Raion]]. It had a population,  before the Russian invasion, of {{Ua-pop-est2022|1,421,125|.}} 

Kharkiv was founded in 1654 as a fortress, and grew to become a major centre of industry, trade, and [[Ukrainian culture]] in Sloboda Ukraine in the multiethnic [[Russian Empire]]. At the beginning of the 20th century the city had a predominantly [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and Russian population, but as industrial expansion drew in further labor from the distressed countryside, and as the [[Soviet Union]] moderated previous restrictions on Ukrainian cultural expression, [[Ukrainians]] became the largest ethnic group in the city by the eve of [[World War II]]. From December 1919 to January 1934, Kharkiv was the capital of the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]].

Kharkiv is a major cultural, scientific, educational, transport, and industrial centre of Ukraine, with numerous museums, theatres, and libraries, including the [[Annunciation Cathedral, Kharkiv|Annunciation]] and [[Dormition Cathedral, Kharkiv|Dormition]] cathedrals, the [[Derzhprom]] building in [[Freedom Square (Kharkiv)|Freedom Square]], and the [[National University of Kharkiv]]. Industry plays a significant role in Kharkiv's economy, specialised primarily in [[machinery]] and [[electronics]]. There are hundreds of industrial facilities throughout the city, including the [[Kharkiv Morozov Machine Building Design Bureau|Morozov Design Bureau]], the [[Malyshev Factory]], [[Khartron]], [[Turboatom]], and [[Antonov]].

In March and April 2014 security forces and counter-demonstrators defeated efforts by [[Russian people's militias in Ukraine|Russian-backed separatists]] to seize control of the city and regional administration. Kharkiv was a major target for Russian forces in the [[eastern Ukraine campaign]] during the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]] before they were pushed back to the [[Russia–Ukraine border]]. The city remains under intermittent [[Kharkiv strikes (2022–present)|Russian fire]], with reports that almost a quarter of the city was destroyed by April 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Balmforth |first=Tom |title=Ukraine's air defence shortages leave Kharkiv more exposed to Russian bombs |website=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/kharkivs-civilians-under-fire-ukraine-faces-catastrophic-air-defence-shortage-2024-04-12/ }} (12 April 2024)</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Security |first1=Ellie Cook |last2=Reporter |first2=Defense |date=11 April 2024 |title=Zelensky issues dire Kharkiv warning |url=https://www.newsweek.com/volodymyr-zelensky-kharkiv-warning-russia-ground-operation-offensive-ukraine-1889311 |access-date=2024-04-11 |website=[[Newsweek]] |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Ukraine war briefing: Kharkiv residents suffer as Russia intensifies attacks {{!}} Ukraine {{!}} The Guardian |url=https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2024/may/01/ukraine-war-briefing-kharkiv-residents-suffer-as-russia-intensifies-attacks |access-date=2024-05-01 |website=amp.theguardian.com}}</ref>

===Early history===
[[File:Kharko.jpg|thumb|A depiction of the legendary founder "Khariton or Kharko" (postcard of the Russian imperial period, c. 1890s).]]
The earliest historical references to the region are to [[Scythians|Scythian]] and [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]] settlement in the 2nd century BC. Between the 2nd to the 6th centuries AD there is evidence of [[Chernyakhov culture]], a multiethnic mix of the [[Getae|Geto]]-[[Dacians|Dacian]], [[Sarmatians|Sarmatian]], and [[Goths|Gothic]] populations.

By the early 17th century the area was a contested frontier region with renegade populations that had begun to organise in [[Cossacks|Cossack]] formations and communities defined by a common determination to resist both [[Tatars|Tatar]] slavery, and Polish-Lithuanian and Russian [[serfdom]]. Mid-century, the [[Khmelnytsky uprising]] against the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]] saw the brief establishment of an independent [[Cossack Hetmanate]].<ref name="Solchanyk2001">{{cite book |author=Roman Solchanyk |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LNvTSDQXFXgC&pg=PA6 |title=Ukraine and Russia: The Post-Soviet Transition |date=January 2001 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-0-7425-1018-0 |page=6 |access-date=31 March 2015 |archive-date=2 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231002071000/https://books.google.com/books?id=LNvTSDQXFXgC&pg=PA6#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

The settlement reluctantly accepted the protection and authority of a Russian [[voivode]] from [[Chuhuiv]] {{convert|40|km|mi}} to the east. The first appointed voivode from Moscow was Voyin Selifontov in 1656, who began to build a local [[Ostrog (fortress)|ostrog]] (fort). In 1658, a new voivode, Ivan Ofrosimov, commanded the locals to kiss the cross in a demonstration of loyalty to [[Alexis of Russia|Tsar Alexis]]. Led by their [[otaman]] Ivan Kryvoshlyk, they refused. However, with the election of a new otaman, Tymish Lavrynov, relations appear to have been repaired, the Tsar in Moscow granting the community's request (signed by the [[Dean (Christianity)|deans]] of the new [[Assumption Cathedral, Kharkiv|Assumption Cathedral]] and parish churches of Annunciation and Trinity) to establish a local market.<ref name="living_kharkiv" />

At that time the population of Kharkiv was just over 1000, half of whom were local Cossacks. Selifontov had brought with him a Moscow garrison of only 70 soldiers.<ref name="living_kharkiv" /> Defence rested with a local Sloboda Cossack regiment under the jurisdiction of the Razryad [[Prikaz]], a military agency commanded from [[Belgorod]].<ref name="living_kharkiv" />[[File:Харьков.

The original walls of Kharkiv enclosed today's streets: vulytsia Kvitky-Osnovianenko, Constitution Square, Rose Luxemburg Square, Proletarian Square, and Cathedral Descent.<ref name="living_kharkiv"/> There were 10 towers of which the tallest, Vestovska, was some {{convert|16|m|ft}} high.

After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, the USDLP was the main party in the first Ukrainian government, the [[General Secretariat of Ukraine]]. The [[Tsentralna Rada]] (central council) of Ukrainian parties in ''Kyiv'' authorised the Secretariat to negotiate national autonomy with the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. In the succeeding months, as wartime conditions deteriorated, the USDLP lost support in Kharkiv and elsewhere to the [[Ukrainian Socialist Revolutionary Party]] (SR) which organised both in peasant communities and in disaffected military units.<ref name=":6" />

Propaganda made much of its "youthfulness", a designation broadly used to suggest the relative absence in the city of "material and spiritual relics" from the pre-revolutionary era, and its commitment to the new frontiers of Soviet industry and science.

After the Euromaidan events and Russian [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|actions in the Crimea]] and [[War in Donbas (2014–2022)|Donbas]] ruptured relations with Moscow, the Kharkiv region experienced a sharp fall in output and employment. Once a hub of cross border trade, Kharkiv was turned into a border fortress. A reorientation to new international markets, increased defense contracts (after Kyiv, the region contains the second-largest number of military-related enterprises) and export growth in the economy's services sector helped fuel a recovery, but people's incomes did not return to pre-2014 levels.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web |last=Jarábik |first=Natalia Shapovalova, Balázs |title=How Eastern Ukraine Is Adapting and Surviving: The Case of Kharkiv |url=https://carnegieeurope.eu/2018/09/12/how-eastern-ukraine-is-adapting-and-surviving-case-of-kharkiv-pub-77216 |access-date=2022-08-13 |website=Carnegie Europe |language=en |archive-date=8 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220308154832/https://www.rferl.org/a/kharkiv-operation-ukraine-terrorism-separatist-arrests/25324984.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

By 2018 Kharkiv officially has the lowest unemployment rate in Ukraine, 6 percent. But in part this reflected labor shortages caused by the steady outflow of young and skilled workers to Poland and other European countries.<ref name=":02" />

Until 18 July 2020, Kharkiv was incorporated as a [[city of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and served as the administrative center of Kharkiv Raion though it did not belong to the raion. In July 2020, as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Kharkiv Oblast to seven, the city of Kharkiv was merged into Kharkiv Raion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів.
