'''Barka''' ({{langx|ar|بَرْكَاء|Barkāʾ}}) is a coastal city and ''[[Wilayah]]'' ([[Provinces of Oman|Province]]) in the region [[Al Batinah Region|Al Bāţinah]], in northern [[Oman]]. Bordered by the [[Gulf of Oman|Sea of Oman]] and the [[Hajar Mountains]] in southern Batinah, Barka is about a half-hour drive from As-[[Seeb]] and roughly an hour's drive from Al-Khuwair and [[Ruwi]].

==History==
[[File:Persian Gulf PT1.png|thumb|309x309px|Main cities, ports and routes of the [[Portuguese empire]] in the [[Persian Gulf]] in the [[16th century|16th]] and [[17th century|17th]] centuries]]

[[Al Bloushi]], [[Al-Farsi]], Al Zadjali, Al Habsi, Al Ajmi, Al Owaisi, Al Amri, Al Badri and Al Raisi tribes live here. The area is known for its agricultural beauty, fishing, and traditional pastimes like horse and [[camel racing]], [[Halva|halwa]] making, and Omani-style bullfighting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofoman.com/article/82133/Lifestyle/Property-Times/5-Reasons-To-Love-Barka|title=5 Reasons To Love Barka|date=2016-04-24|website=Times of Oman|language=en|access-date=2019-12-01}}</ref>

Nearby is Bait Na'aman (Nu'man), a four-towered fort of [[Imam]] [[Bil'arab bin Sultan]] of the [[17th century]], renovated in 1991.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bait Na’aman|url=http://www.roughguides.com/destinations/middle-east/oman/al-batinah-al-dhahirah/barka/bait-naaman/|website=Al Batinah and Al Dhahirah Guide|publisher=Rough Guides}}</ref> Barka Fort is a known tourist attraction. Barka Souq, near the beach is an economically important area. There are two major resorts in Barka, the [[Al Sawadi, Oman|Al-Sawadi]] resort and the Al-Nahda resort. 

==Economy==
A new quarter is now under construction in Sawadi, called the [[Blue City, Oman|"Blue City"]]. The development is 8&nbsp;km from Sawadi beach, and many international companies are involved in Barka development projects.  There is an estimated $15 billion in new construction currently taking place here. Barka is the site of several power and water plants, including:
* The Barka 2 water and power plant, with generation capacity of 678 MW and desalination capacity of 26.4 million gallons of potable water per day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Barka 2 Independent Water & Power Project|url=http://www.mubadala.com/en/what-we-do/utilities/barka-2-independent-water-power-project|publisher=Mubadala|access-date=10 November 2015}}</ref>
* The Barka 3 gas turbine power plant, with generation capacity of 744 MW, sponsored by [[Engie]], [[Yonden]] and [[Sojitz]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Commercial Operations of Sohar 2 and Barka 3 IPP Projects in Oman Start|url=https://www.sojitz.com/en/news/2013/04/20130415.php|publisher=Sojitz Corporation|access-date=10 November 2015}}</ref>
* A new 281,000 m³/d desalination plant is to be commissioned: [[Itochu]], [[Degremont]] and [[International Power]] were named preferred bidders in 2015.<ref>{{cite news|title=Oman names preferred bidders for Sohar and Barka projects|url=http://www.desalination.biz/news/news_story.asp?id=8214&title=Oman+names+preferred+bidders+for+Sohar+and+Barka+projects|access-date=10 November 2015|work=The International Desalination & Water Reuse Quarterly|date=21 October 2015}}</ref>

== The Blue City ==
Located on a peninsula 30 minutes from [[Muscat International Airport|Muscat Seeb Airport]], Al Madina A'Zarqa was to be a 32-square-kilometer (12 sq mi) waterfront city built along 16 kilometers (9.9 mi) of shoreline adjacent to the [[Gulf of Oman]].

One of the largest-scale developments in the Middle East, the Al Madina A'Zarqa represented an investment of between $15–$20 billion. The first round of financing was secured through the issuance of a bond note by [[Bear Stearns]] on international markets, raising US$925 million. The note was rated Baa3 by ratings agency [[Moody's]] in March, 2007, following on from a BBB− rating by [[Fitch Ratings]] when the note was issued. Bear Stearns was subsequently awarded "Middle East Leisure Deal of the Year 2006" by Project Finance for the arranging of the Blue City note.

The organization behind the project was Al Sawadi Investment & Tourism Company (ASIT) which had the endorsement of the government of Oman to bring the development to life.
