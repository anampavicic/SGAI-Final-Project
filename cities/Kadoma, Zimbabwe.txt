==History==
The city of Kadoma was known as Gatooma until after independence, on 18 April 1982, when new names for 32 places were gazetted.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/ADA135022.pdf| title= Zimbabwe: A country study| series= Area Handbook Series| editor-first= Harold D. |editor-last= Nelson| date=August 1982|publisher = United States Government| quote=Rev. ed. of: Area handbook for Southern Rhodesia. 1975| p=xvii}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url=https://journals.co.za/doi/pdf/10.10520/AJA02562804_270| journal=[[Africa Insight]]| title=Urban change in Zimbabwe|first=Hywel |last=Davies| volume= 14| issue= 3|date= 1984| p=163}}</ref> Gatooma was founded in the 1890s as a mining camp, and constituted under a village management board in 1907. The settlement was named after the nearby [[kraal]] of Chief Katuma,<ref>{{cite book|author=Room, A.|title=Placenames of the World |year=1997 |edition=2nd |publisher=McFarland |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&q=kadoma+etymology&pg=PA184|access-date=10 February 2009 | isbn=978-0-7864-2248-7}}</ref> who is represented on the town's coat of arms by the mountain bearing his name and the chief's badge of office.<ref>{{cite web|title=Coat of arms of Kadoma (Zimbabwe)|publisher=Heraldry of the World |url=http://www.ngw.nl/int/afr/zim/kadoma.htm|access-date=10 February 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205104922/http://www.ngw.nl/int/afr/zim/kadoma.htm|archive-date=5 December 2010|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

The Specks Hotel was opened in 1907, and Jameson High School started the same year when Amelia Fitt, wife of the first mayor of Kadoma, started to give classes to the town children in her house. 

In 1917 Gatooma Municipality was created. 

A public electricity supply was introduced in Kadoma in 1922. 

The Grand Hotel opened in 1925 and had a [[sprung floor]] for dancing, the first such floor in Zimbabwe.

In the 1970s Gatooma held highland games which was attended by the Salisbury Caledonian Society Pipe Band, Churchill School Pipe Band from Salisbury and the Northlea School Pipe Band from Bulawayo.
