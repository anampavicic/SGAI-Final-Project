The history and economic growth of Minneapolis are linked to water, the city's defining physical characteristic. [[Glacial history of Minnesota|Long periods of glaciation and interglacial melt]] carved several riverbeds through what is now Minneapolis.{{sfn|Wright|1990|pp=3–4}} During the [[last glacial period]], around 10,000 years ago, ice buried in these ancient river channels melted, resulting in basins that filled with water to become the [[List of lakes in Minneapolis|lakes of Minneapolis]].{{sfn|Wright|1990|p=4}} Meltwater from [[Lake Agassiz]] fed the [[Glacial River Warren]], which created [[River Warren Falls|a large waterfall]] that eroded upriver past the confluence of the Mississippi River, where it left a {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on|abbr=off|sp=us}} drop in the Mississippi.{{sfn|Wright|1990|p=14}} This site is located in what is now downtown Saint Paul. The new waterfall, later called Saint Anthony Falls, in turn, eroded up the Mississippi about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in|abbr=off|sp=us}} to its present location, carving the [[Mississippi River gorge]] as it moved upstream. [[Minnehaha Falls]] also developed during this period via similar processes.{{sfn|Fremling|2005|pp=56–60}}{{sfn|Wright|1990|p=14}}
