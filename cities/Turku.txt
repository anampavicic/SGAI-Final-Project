However, Turku lost its status as capital only three years later in 1812,<ref name="timeout"/> when [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia]] decided to move the capital to [[Helsinki]]. It was only after the last [[Great Fire of Turku|great fire in 1827]] that most government institutions were moved to Helsinki along with the [[Royal Academy of Turku]], founded in 1640, which later became the [[University of Helsinki]], thus consolidating Helsinki's position as the new capital. Turku was Finland's most populous city until the late 1840s and remains the regional capital, an important business and cultural centre, and a port.

=={{anchor|Names and etymology}}Names and etymology==
{{see also|Names of Turku in different languages}}
The Finnish name ''Turku'' originates from Sweden and Russia. The first information about the word ''tori'' dates back to the 16th century and was borrowed from Sweden (cf. {{langx|sv|torg}}, "market"). In Sweden, the word is not original, but borrowed from an [[Old East Slavic]] word, ''[[wikt:търгъ#Old East Slavic|tǔrgǔ]]'', which in modern Russian means [[market place]], [[haggling]] or trading. However, the old Russian word also passed directly into the Finnish language and took the form ''[[wikt:turku#Finnish|turku]]''. Today the word is only used in [[idioms]], but already in the Middle Ages the word gradually came to mean the town name Turku.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kotus.fi/nyt/kysymyksia_ja_vastauksia/sanojen_alkuperasta/sanojen_alkuperasta_s-t/tori_ja_turku |title=Tori ja Turku |publisher=Kotimaisten kielten keskus |language=fi |access-date=16 October 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.katajala.net/keskiaika/suomi/kaupungit.html |title=Keskiaika – Suomen kaupungit keskiajalla |publisher=Katajala.net |access-date=16 September 2011 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303185914/http://www.katajala.net/keskiaika/suomi/kaupungit.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Swedish name ''Åbo'' may be a simple combination of ''å'' ("river; creek; large stream") and ''bo'' ("dwelling"). There is however an old legal term called "{{illm|åborätt|sv|åborätt}}" (meaning roughly "right to live at"), which gave citizens (called "åbo") the inheritable right to live at land owned by the crown (''å'' meant ''at'' or ''on'' in old Swedish, now ''på'').

In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], the [[Finnish noun cases|genitive]] of ''Turku'' is '''''Turun''''', meaning "of Turku". The Finnish names of organizations and institutes of Turku often begin with this word, as in ''Turun yliopisto'' for the [[University of Turku]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Turku}}
Turku has a long history as [[Finland]]'s largest city and occasionally as the administrative center of the country, but for the last two hundred years has been surpassed by [[Helsinki]]. The city's identity stems from its status as the oldest city in Finland<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.visitfinland.com/W5/index.nsf/(pages)/Destinations |title=Destinations in Finland – Official Travel and Tourism Guide |publisher=Visitfinland.com |access-date=6 May 2009 |archive-date=13 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113125820/http://www.visitfinland.com/w5/index.nsf/(pages)/Destinations |url-status=live }}</ref> and the country's first capital.<ref name="finland-portrait">{{cite web |url=https://www.finlandportrait.com/history-of-finland/ |title=History of Finland |work=Finland Portrait |date=25 March 2023 |access-date=1 July 2023 |archive-date=1 July 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230701133443/https://www.finlandportrait.com/history-of-finland/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Originally, the word "Finland" referred only to the area around Turku (hence the title, "[[Finland Proper]]" for the region).

===Early history===

Settlement in the Turku area is relatively recent, as the Southwestern Finland remained below sea level for an extended period due to the [[Last Glacial Period|Ice Age]]. Due to [[tectonic uplift]], the Turku region transformed from an outlying [[archipelago]] to a shoreline during 3000-2000 BCE. The area was densely populated during the [[Iron Age]] as it was the most important agricultural region in the region.<ref name="Lahtinen2015_9">[[#Lahtine2015|Lahtinen (2015)]], pp. 9</ref> Ancient cemeteries dating from 550 to 1150 have been discovered in the region. Some cemeteries were utilized during the initial migratory phase, while some were solely utilized during the Viking Age, and others were established in the 12th century. There are also remains of houses and villages and old forts from the late Iron Age.<ref>{{Cite book |first1=Ella |last1=Kivikoski |first2=C.

According to legend, the English [[Henry (bishop of Finland)|bishop Henry]] baptised the first Finns into Christianity in 1150. However, the first Christian graves date from the 10th and 11th centuries, and the first archaeological evidence of a church dates from the 12th century.<ref name="Lahtinen2015_11">[[#Lahtine2015|Lahtinen (2015)]], pp. 11</ref> In the 11th century, the Turku region began to develop as a port.<ref name="Lahtinen2015_9"/> The oldest known road, [[Hämeen Härkätie|Hämeen härkätie]], connected to region and the [[Old Castle of Lieto]] to [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]] in the 9th century at the latest.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Masonen |first=Jaakko |title=Hämeen Härkätie |publisher=Otava |year=1991 |isbn=951-1-11421-2 |location=Helsinki |pages=186–190 }}</ref> Early literary sources such as [[Tabula Rogeriana|Al-Idrisi's world map from 1154]] mentions Turku.<ref name="earlyhistory">[https://www.turku.fi/ensimmaisena-turussa Suomen historian merkkipaaluja: Ensimmäisenä Turussa] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210430072659/https://www.turku.fi/ensimmaisena-turussa |date=30 April 2021 }} (in Finnish)</ref>

After the [[Finnish War]], Sweden ceded Finland to [[Russian Empire|Imperial Russia]] at the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] in 1809. There was no resistance of any kind in Turku when the Russians marched into the city in October 1809 in connection with the Finnish War. Despite the occupation, life in Turku continued peacefully. The Court of Appeal of Turku continued its session when the Russians arrived, and later in the spring [[Jacob Tengström]], the [[List of bishops of Turku|Archbishop of Turku and Finland]], and the teaching staff of the Turku Academy swore an oath of loyalty to their new ruler.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www05.turku.fi/turkuinfo/historia/hist_silmays.html |title=Turku Suomen pääkaupunkina |publisher=City of Turku |date=2005 |access-date=17 February 2023 |language=fi |archive-date=23 May 2012 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120523222801/http://www05.turku.fi/turkuinfo/historia/hist_silmays.html |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref>

Turku became briefly the official capital,<ref name="finland-portrait"/> but soon lost the status to Helsinki, as Emperor [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] felt that Turku was too far from Russia and too aligned with Sweden to serve as the capital of the [[Grand Duchy of Finland]]. The change officially took place in 1812.

In the middle of the 19th century, Turku was, after Helsinki, the most important craft city in Finland, but the [[Industrial Revolution]] with [[Steam engine|steam]] and [[electric machine]]s was experienced in Turku only around 1900. The [[First World War]] provided a boost to the city's industry, as the export difficulties affected the [[wood industry]], which Turku didn't have much of, and it was easy to get much-needed raw materials from neutral Sweden.<ref>{{cite book |first=Eino |last=Jutikkala |title=Turun kaupungin historia 1856–1917 |year=1957 |pages=73–150 |location=Turku |publisher=Turun sanomalehti ja kirjapaino osakeyhtiö |language=fi }}</ref>

In 1918, a new university, the [[Åbo Akademi]] – the only [[Swedish-language]] university in Finland – was founded in Turku.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Åbo Akademi University |url=https://www.abo.fi/en/about-abo-akademi-university/ |access-date=22 August 2020 |website=Åbo Akademi University |language=en-US |archive-date=6 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190506140846/https://www.abo.fi/en/about-abo-akademi-university/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Two years later, the [[Finnish-language]] [[University of Turku]] was founded alongside it. These two universities are the second and third to be founded in Finland, both by private donations.

In the 20th century, Turku was called "Finland's gateway to the West" by historians such as {{ill|Jarmo Virmavirta|fi}}.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last1=Antikainen |editor-first1=Anne |editor-last2=Tarja |editor-first2=Pyöriä |title=Kaupunkiseutujen kasvun aika |year=2004 |chapter=Turku – Suomen portti länteen |publisher=Sisäministeriö |isbn=951-734-671-9 |language=fi }}</ref> The city enjoyed good connections with other Western European countries and cities, especially since the 1940s with [[Stockholm]] across the [[Gulf of Bothnia]].

After the [[fall of communism]] in Russia, many prominent Soviets came to Turku to study Western business practices, among them [[Vladimir Putin]], then Leningrad's deputy mayor.<ref>{{cite web |title=Putin on vanha Turun-kävijä |url=https://www.ts.fi/uutiset/502110 |website=TS.fi |date=25 June 2013 |publisher=Turun Sanomat |access-date=12 April 2022 |language=fi |archive-date=12 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220412085832/https://www.ts.fi/uutiset/502110 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Market place turku.jpg|thumb|The [[Market Square, Turku|Market Square]] in 1965]]
As for architecture in the city, both the body of architectural styles as well as the prevalent way of living have experienced significant changes in the 20th century. While having survived relatively intact throughout the years of war 1939–1945{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}}, the city faced increasing changes in the 1950s and 1960s due to rising demands for apartments, the eagerness to rebuild, and most of all the new development of infrastructure (especially increased automobile traffic). The wooden one- to two-story houses that were the dominant mode of building in the city were mostly demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to both enable more efficient building and to ease vehicle traffic. This resulted in the destruction of buildings that were, in later decades, seen as beautiful and worth saving. Some individual buildings remain controversial to this day when it comes to their demolition in the decades after the war. For example, the building of {{ill|Hotel Phoenix|fi|Hotelli Phoenix}} that stood on corner of the [[Market Square, Turku|Market Square]] was torn down to make way for a large, multistory apartment building in 1959. The building was significant both for its location and history: having stood on one of the most valuable lots in the city center since 1878, the building had, for example, served as the first main building of the University of Turku. Other buildings whose demolition was seen as scandalous, either already at the time of action or proved to be so in later years, include {{ill|The Nobel House|fi|Nobelin talo}} (subject of the very first photograph ever taken in Finland) and the building of [[Hamburger Börs (hotel)|Old Hotel Börs]] which was built in jugendstil in 1909 by {{ill|Frithiof Strandell|fi}}.

==Geography==

Situated at the mouth of the [[Aura River (Finland)|Aura River]] in the south-western corner of Finland, Turku covers an area of {{convert|245|km2}} on both banks of the river. The eastern side, where [[Turku Cathedral]] is located, is the older and original centre. It is popularly known as ''täl pual jokke'' ("this side of the river"). The western side, where [[Turku Castle]] is located, is the newer part. It is called ''tois pual jokke'' ("the other side of the river").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.turkulainen.fi/paikalliset/1396763 |title=Kumpi parempi: Täl pual vai tois pual? |work=Turkulainen |date=14 March 2019 |access-date=17 February 2023 |language=fi |archive-date=17 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230217143221/https://www.turkulainen.fi/paikalliset/1396763 |url-status=live }}</ref> In modern times, both banks of the Aura River are equally the [[City Centre, Turku|centre of the city]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.visitturku.fi/the-aura-riverside---turku--s-living-room3 |title=The Aura Riverside – Turku's Living Room |work=Visit Turku |access-date=22 October 2023 |language=en }}</ref>

There are ten bridges over the Aura river in Turku. The oldest of the current bridges is {{ill|Auransilta|fi}}, which was constructed in 1904. The newest bridge is {{ill|Kirjastosilta|fi}} ('library bridge'), a pedestrian-only bridge built in 2013.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turku.fi/public/?contentid=480599&nodeid=23 |title=Kirjastosilta avattiin tulen ja valon juhlassa |publisher=www.turku.fi |access-date=10 January 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114100705/https://www.turku.fi/public/?contentid=480599&nodeid=23 |archive-date=14 January 2014 }}</ref> The ''[[Föri]]'', a small ferry that transports pedestrians and bicycles across the river without payment, is a well known feature of the city.

===Administrative subdivisions===
{{Main|Wards of Turku}}
[[File:Stålarminkatu-Mestarinkatu.jpg|thumb|right|[[IV District, Turku|IV District]], or Martti, is one of the smallest but most densely populated districts of Turku]]
The city is divided into 78 districts and nine [[Ward (country subdivision)|wards]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.turku.fi/asuminen-ja-ymparisto/asuminen/kaupunginosat |title=Kaupunginosat |work=City of Turku |date=5 May 2015 |access-date=22 October 2023 |language=fi }}</ref> These do not operate as units of local government. However, some social programmes are district-based, especially in the eastern part of the city, where unemployment is high in some areas. The largest populated districts are [[Varissuo]] and [[Runosmäki]]. By area, [[Kakskerta]] and [[Paattinen]] are the largest districts.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

As many of the small neighbouring [[municipalities of Finland|municipalities]] from the north and south of the city were annexed during the mid-20th century, Turku is today shaped like an elongated pear. The city centre and most of the suburban areas lie in the middle, separated from the less densely populated northern rural areas by the Turku [[Bypass (road)|bypass]], that forms part of [[European route E18]]. Islands such as [[Ruissalo]], [[Hirvensalo]] and [[Kakskerta]], forming the southern part of the city, are also sparsely populated and mostly contain summer residences, with the exception of some districts in Hirvensalo which are currently growing into [[upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] suburbs.

===Climate===
[[File:Autumn in Turku.jpg|thumb|Area of [[Turku cathedral]] in autumn]]
Situated by the [[Baltic Sea]] and sheltered by the islands of the [[Archipelago Sea]], Turku has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfb''). Like much of southern Finland, the city experiences warm summers, with temperatures ranging up to 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F), and relatively cold winters with frequent snowfall. The warmest month of the year is July, with an average temperature of {{cvt|17.5|°C|0}}, whereas the coldest month is February. The average year-round temperature is around {{cvt|6.0|°C|0}}. Winter usually starts in early December, and spring in late March.

[[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] in Turku averages {{cvt|720|mm|1}} a year. The rainiest month of the year is August, when the city receives on average {{cvt|80|mm|1}} of rainfall. In April, the driest month of the year, the figure is only {{cvt|32|mm|1}}. The average [[air pressure]] at sea level is {{convert|101.2|kPa|inHg}}, with little variance throughout the year.

Operational since 1955, the city's [[weather station]] is located at an altitude of {{convert|47|m|ft|abbr=off}} at [[Turku Airport]].<ref>'Turku' at EuroWeather</ref> The weather in the city itself is affected by the proximity of the sea, so the wintertime temperatures are often milder than those measured at the airport. The moderating impact of the sea helps oak maple and ash trees, which are quite rare elsewhere in Finland, to thrive by the areas along the shoreline and in the archipelago.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/15734/2009nro8.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |title=Suomen maakuntien ilmasto |access-date=7 October 2021 |archive-date=19 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210319235916/https://helda.helsinki.fi/bitstream/handle/10138/15734/2009nro8.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |url-status=live }}</ref>

For a city of its size, Turku has a moderate public transport network of bus routes, which is comparable to the bus network of similar-sized [[Tampere]]. The bus network is managed and supervised by the ''Turku City Region's Public Transport Committee'' (FÖLI) ({{langx|fi|Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta}}, {{langx|sv|kollektivtrafiknämnden för Åbo stadsregion}}), and is operated mainly by private companies. Bus traffic to and in the neighbouring municipalities of Kaarina, Lieto, Naantali, Raisio and Rusko are also handled by FÖLI. The bus rates are the same when traveling within these municipalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foli.fi/fi/tietoja-ja-ohjeita/joukkoliikennetietoa |title=Joukkoliikennetietoa |access-date=14 January 2016 |publisher=Turun kaupunkiseudun joukkoliikennelautakunta |language=fi |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110115933/http://www.foli.fi/fi/tietoja-ja-ohjeita/joukkoliikennetietoa |archive-date=10 January 2016 }}</ref>

Rail traffic to and from Turku is handled by the Finnish national carrier, [[VR (Finnish railway company)|VR]]. The number of services has fallen and only the railways towards Tampere and Helsinki are now in use. The railway stations currently used for passenger traffic are the [[Turku Central railway station]] in [[Pohjola, Turku|Pohjola]], and two smaller stations in [[Kupittaa]] and the [[Port of Turku]].

There is no local rail traffic at the moment, as the city's popular tram services were discontinued in 1972, and the various local railway lines to neighbouring towns and municipalities were all abolished during the late 20th century. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} However, there are plans for a [[light rail]] system in the Turku region in the near future. According to the current estimate the tramway’s construction will start in 2026 and finish in 2031. The first route will be constructed between Turku Port−City Centre−Varissuo residential area. Route’s estimated length is 11 kilometers (6.8 miles) with 17 stops. <ref>{{Cite web |last= |date= |title=Turku Tramway |url=https://www.turku.fi/en/tramway |access-date=22 September 2023 |website=Turku.fi |language= |archive-date=4 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231004164209/https://www.turku.fi/en/tramway |url-status=live }}</ref>

The first outdoor inclined elevator, the Funicular, is located in Turku. The elevator offers unimpeded access to Kakolanmäki hill where is no other public transport. The Funicular has two stations and travelling time between the stations is approximately one minute. It is possible to hop on and off at both stations and travelling is free of charge. The elevator’s rail is about 130 meters long and height difference between two stations about 30 meters. <ref>{{Cite web |last= |date= |title=Funicular |url=https://www.turku.fi/en/funicular |access-date=22 September 2023 |website=Turku.fi |language= |archive-date=6 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406032341/https://www.turku.fi/en/funicular |url-status=live }}</ref>

The State of Finland has announced plans to support [[Espoo]] with 30% of full expenses on a new metro rail, the Regional Council of Southwest Finland is going to use this as a test case for a new light rail network in Turku.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kotimaa/?ts=1,3:1002:0:0,4:2:0:1:2006-09-27,104:2:407945,1:0:0:0:0:0 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070630122159/http://www.turunsanomat.fi/kotimaa/?ts=1,3:1002:0:0,4:2:0:1:2006-09-27,104:2:407945,1:0:0:0:0:0 |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 June 2007 |title=Turun Sanomat |publisher=Turunsanomat.fi |date=27 September 2006 |access-date=6 May 2009 }}</ref>

The Turku Bus Station and the Turku Central railway station are currently located in different places. The City of Turku is planning to combine these two in a new greater station complex in the near future. This new travel center will consist of a hotel and several shopping estates. This center will connect all public transportation from commuter trains to long-distance buses.

Turku's most significant highways for traffic are [[Finnish national road 1|Highway 1]] leading to [[Helsinki]]; [[Finnish national road 10|Highway 10]] leading to [[Hämeenlinna]]; [[Finnish national road 9|Highway 9]] leading to [[Tampere]], [[Jyväskylä]], [[Kuopio]] and [[Joensuu]]; [[Finnish national road 8|Highway 8]] leading to [[Pori]], [[Vaasa]] and [[Oulu]]; and the [[Turku Ring Road]], which protrudes circumferentially from Turku.

[[Turku Airport]] is located {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north of the city centre, partly in the neighbouring municipality of [[Rusko]]. The airport is served by six passenger airlines, including [[airBaltic]] and [[Scandinavian Airlines|SAS Scandinavian]], and one cargo airline.

There are also daily ferry services from the [[Port of Turku]] to Sweden and [[Åland]], operated by [[Silja Line]] and [[Viking Line]]. These are something of a Finnish cultural tradition (see [[ruotsinlaiva]]), and people often travel long distances across Finland to Turku just to take a [[cruising (maritime)|cruise]] across the Gulf of Bothnia.

The [[Archipelago Sea]] boat traffic is handled by, among others, [[SS Ukkopekka]], an old [[steamship]] that cruises on the route Turku-[[Naantali]]-Turku.

Turku is the only city in Finland to have three long-distance railway stations: [[Turku Central Station|Turku Central]], [[Port of Turku]], and [[Kupittaa railway station|Kupittaa]].

==Education==
[[File:Turun yliopisto.jpg|thumb|right|The main building of the [[University of Turku]]]]

Turku has a longer educational history than any other Finnish city – the first school in the city, the [[Katedralskolan i Åbo|Cathedral School]], was founded along with Turku Cathedral in the late 13th century. The first university in Finland, the [[Royal Academy of Turku]] (now [[University of Helsinki]]), was established in the city in 1640. In 1820, the first school in Finland conforming to the [[Bell-Lancaster method]] was founded in Turku with the aim of making primary education more inclusive to the lower classes.

Turku is home to about 40 000 higher education students.<ref>{{cite web |title=Opiskelijakaupunki Turku -info |url=https://www.turku.fi/opiskelijakaupunki/info |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230127165650/https://www.turku.fi/opiskelijakaupunki/info |archive-date=27 January 2023 |access-date=22 September 2023 |website=Turku.fi |url-status=live }}</ref> There are two universities and several "[[University of applied sciences (Finland)|polytechnics]]" in the town.
