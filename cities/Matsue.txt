== History ==
{{stack|[[File:Matsue view from matsue castle - 2019 1 4.webm|thumb|thumbtime=26|City view from [[Matsue Castle]], 2019]]}}
Matsue is located within ancient [[Izumo Province]] and there are many [[archaeological site]]s from the [[Yayoi period|Yayoi]], [[Kofun period|Kofun]]s and [[Nara period]]s  within the city borders. The area was also the stronghold of the [[Amago clan]] during the [[Sengoku period]].
The present-day [[jōkamachi|castle town]] of Matsue was originally established by [[Horio Yoshiharu]], lord of the Matsue clan, when he built Matsue castle and planned the surrounding town over a five-year period from 1607 to 1611. Matsue continued to be the seat of [[Matsue Domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] until the [[Meiji restoration]]. Horio Yoshiharu's son Tadauji died before his father, thus the province was inherited by his grandson Tadaharu. However, Tadaharu died childless so the province was passed on to the [[Kyōgoku clan| Kyōgoku]].  Kyōgoku Takatsugu served [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. Takatsugu's son Tadataka married the 4th daughter of Hidetada, Hatsu. He served in the [[Battle of Osaka]] and reportedly took 300 heads. In 1634, he received the province of Izumo, succeeding the childless Horio Tadaharu. During his rule he was instrumental in engineering projects that helped control the flow of the Hiikawa river.

In 1637, Tadataka also died childless and the domain passed to the [[Matsudaira clan]]. Naomasa was the third son of [[Tokugawa Hideyasu]]. Hideyasu, daimyō of [[Echizen Province]], himself was the second son of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], making Naomasa the grandson of the first Tokugawa Shōgun. Naomasa made a name for himself fighting in the Battle of Osaka at the age of 14. He was daimyō of Ono in Echizen and later [[Matsumoto Domain|Matsumoto]] in [[Shinano Province]] before becoming the ruler of Izumo 1638. Unlike the previous rulers Naomasa had children and his heirs managed to keep Izumo for ten generations until the end of the [[Edo period]]. Overall, ten Matsudaira ''daimyō'' ruled Matsue. The most famous after the first (Matsudaira Naomasa) is the seventh, [[Matsudaira Harusato]], more commonly referred to as Fumai (不昧公).<ref>https://fumaikou.jp/about {{Dead link|date=March 2022}}</ref> He revolutionized the administrative system of the Matsue clan which was in financial difficulties and put it back on its feet. He invested in [[mulberry]] bushes and promoted special foods like ''[[Shijimi (clam)|shijimi]]'' clams that were a delicacy in Matsue. Harusato was a great enthusiast of [[Japanese tea ceremony]]. Because his influence on ''[[wagashi]]'', Japanese sweets for the tea ceremony from Matsue are famous, especially one called ''wakakusa''.
