'''Juba''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|uː|b|ə}})<ref>{{cite web |title=Juba: is the capital of South Sudan, on the White Nile river. Pop: 250 000 (2006 est) |url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Juba |access-date=27 October 2013 |publisher=[[Dictionary.com]]}}</ref> is the [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city of [[South Sudan]]. The city is situated on the [[White Nile]] and also serves as the capital of the [[Central Equatoria|Central Equatoria State]]. It is the most recently declared national capital and had a population of 525,953 in 2017. It has an area of {{convert|52|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, with the metropolitan area covering {{convert|336|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

Juba was established in 1920–21 by the [[Church Mission Society|Church Missionary Society]] (CMS) in a small [[Bari people|Bari]] village, also called Juba. The city was made as the capital of [[Mongalla Province]] in the late 1920s. The growth of the town accelerated following the signing of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] in 2005,<ref name=":1">{{cite web |last1=Martin |first1=Ellen |last2=Mosel |first2=Irina |date=January 2011 |title=City limits: urbanisation and vulnerability in Sudan |url=https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6511.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170315085247/https://www.odi.org/sites/odi.org.uk/files/odi-assets/publications-opinion-files/6511.pdf |archive-date=15 March 2017 |archive-format=PDF |access-date=22 October 2020 |website=Overseas Department Institute}}</ref> which made Juba the capital of the [[Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan]]. Juba became the capital of South Sudan in 2011 after its [[independence]], but influential parties wanted [[Ramciel]] to be the capital. The government announced the move of the capital to Ramciel, but it is yet to occur.

==History==
Under the [[Khedivate of Egypt]], Juba served as the southernmost garrison of the [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] army, quartering only a handful of soldiers. Disease was common; soldiers often fell ill due to the [[malaria]], [[meningitis]] and [[blackwater fever]] that was prevalent in the region. Explorers and campaigners [[Samuel Baker]] and [[Florence Baker]] used the nearby island of [[Gondokoro]] as a base during their expeditions to what is now [[South Sudan]] and northern [[Uganda]] from 1863 to 1865 and 1871 to 1873.<ref name="ReferenceA">Shipman, Pat. ''To The Heart of the Nile: Lady Florence Baker and the Exploration of Central Africa''</ref>

The present city of Juba was established on the site of a small [[Bari people|Bari]] village, <!--of 36 families (of the Bekat clan)--> also called Juba,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Richardson|first=J.N.|date=1933|title=Bari Notes|journal=Sudan Notes & Records|volume=16|issue=2|pages=181–186}}</ref> where the [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS) had established a mission and the Nugent Memorial Intermediate School in 1920–21.<ref>{{cite web |last=Keen |first=Rosemary |title=Church Missionary Society Archive, General Introduction and Guide to the Archive |url=http://www.ampltd.co.uk/digital_guides/church_missionary_society_archive_general/editorial%20introduction%20by%20rosemary%20keen.aspx |website=ampltd.co.uk |publisher=Adam Matthew Publications, Pelham House |date=n.d. |access-date=16 December 2016}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{cite book |last=Nalder |first=Leonard F. |title=Equatorial province handbook |publisher=Anglo-Egyptian Sudan government memoranda |date=1936 |oclc=3450641}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Day of devastation, day of contentment: the history of the Sudanese church across 2000 years Volume 10 of Faith in Sudan|last=Werner|first=Roland|date=2000|publisher=Paulines Publications Africa|isbn=9966215298|display-authors=etal}}</ref> In the late 1920s, [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian officials]] ordered Bari residents to relocate so that a new town could be constructed to serve as the capital of [[Mongalla, South Sudan|Mongalla Province]].<ref name="Badiey 2014 38">{{cite book |last=Badiey |first=Naseem |title=The State of Post-conflict Reconstruction: Land, Urban Development and State Building in Juba, Southern Sudan |publisher=Boydell & Brewer Ltd |date=2014 |page=38}}</ref> The site was chosen by Anglo-Egyptian officials partly because of the presence of the CMS Nugent Memorial Intermediate School there, and partly because its proximity to river transportation on the [[Nile]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Shuichiro |first=Nakao |title=A History from Below: Malakia in Juba, South Sudan, c. 1927-1954 |journal=The Journal of Sophia Asian Studies |volume=31 |pages=139–160 |date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Tuttle |first=Brendan |title=To the Juba Wharf |url=https://jubainthemaking.com/to-the-juba-wharf/ |website=Juba in the Making |date=2021 |access-date=19 July 2021}}</ref> Major construction of the new city of Juba was underway by 1927.<ref name="Badiey 2014 38" /> Traders from [[Rejaf]] relocated to the new city in 1929, and the Governor's office of Mongalla was moved there in 1930.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Nakao |last=Shuichiro |title=A History from Below: Malakia in Juba, South Sudan, c. 1927-1954 |journal=The Journal of Sophia Asian Studies |volume=31 |pages=139–160 |date=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |title=Juba in the Making |url=https://jubainthemaking.com/ |website=jubainthemaking.com |publisher=L'Humanité, Le Monde Afrique, & Internazionale}}</ref>

Greek merchants supplying the British Army played an early and central role in the establishment of Juba in the early 1920s.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Shuichiro|first=Nakao|date=2013|title=A History from Below: Malakia in Juba, South Sudan, c. 1927-1954|journal=The Journal of Sophia Asian Studies|volume=31|pages=139–160}}</ref> Their number never exceeded 2,000, but because of their excellent relationship with the native Bari people and the large amount of resulting assistance they received, they built many structures in the downtown Juba Market area as well as in the area that the contemporary [[British Army|British soldiers]] called the Greek Quarter, which is today the small suburb of Hai Jalaba. Many of these structures are still standing today. Public buildings such as the Ivory Bank, Notos Lounge, the old Sudan Airways Building, Paradise Hotel, and the Nile Commercial Bank and Buffalo Commercial Bank were all built by Greeks. Greek merchants were responsible for the construction of the Central Bank building in the mid-1940s, as well as the Juba Hotel in the mid-1930s.<ref>Greek Community of Juba Archives</ref>

From the establishment of [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]] in 1899 the British administered southern Sudan separately from the north. In 1946, without consulting Southern opinion, the British administration began instead to implement a policy of uniting the north and the south. To facilitate the new policy, the [[Juba Conference]] was convened as a gesture to southerners,<ref>{{cite web |title=Juba conf |url=http://madingaweil.com/conference.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311041121/http://madingaweil.com/conference.htm |archive-date=11 March 2007 |access-date=11 March 2007 |website=madingaweil.com}}</ref> the hidden aim being the appeasement of northern Sudanese nationalists and the [[Politics of Egypt|Egyptian government]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Okeny |first=Kenneth |year=1991 |title=The 1947 Juba Conference |url=https://www.africabib.org/rec.php?RID=111593646 |journal=Northeast African Studies |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=39–58 |jstor=43660336}}</ref>

Until 1956, Juba was in [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]], which was jointly administered by the United Kingdom and the [[Kingdom of Egypt]]. In 1955, a mutiny of southern soldiers in [[Torit]] sparked the [[First Sudanese Civil War]], which did not end until 1972. During the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], Juba was a strategic location that was the focus of much fighting.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In 2005, Juba became the interim seat and the capital of the [[Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan]] after the signing of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] (before the agreement, [[Rumbek]] had been the proposed interim capital). With the advent of peace, the United Nations increased its presence in Juba, shifting its management of operations in [[South Sudan|Southern Sudan]] from its previous location in [[Kenya]]. Under the leadership of the United Nations [[OCHA|Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]], the United Nations established a camp known as "OCHA Camp", which served as a base for many United Nations agencies and [[non-governmental organizations]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Juba became the world's newest national capital on 9 July 2011, when South Sudan formally declared its independence from the [[Sudan|Republic of the Sudan]]. However, influential parties including the South Sudanese government expressed dissatisfaction with the city's suitability as a national capital, and the government proposed that a new [[planned city]] be built as a replacement capital elsewhere, most likely [[Ramciel]] in [[Lakes (state)|Lakes]].<ref name="rnw">{{cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/new-capital-city-south-sudan|title=New capital city for South Sudan?|date=6 February 2011|access-date=24 July 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629133501/http://www.rnw.nl/africa/article/new-capital-city-south-sudan|archive-date=29 June 2012|agency=Radio Netherlands}}</ref>

On 5 September 2011, the government announced the capital of South Sudan would move some 250&nbsp;km away from Juba to [[Ramciel]], which is located in the middle of South Sudan, about 60&nbsp;km East of [[Yirol West County]], [[Lakes (state)|Lakes State]]. As of June 2020, the move has yet to occur.

In September 2015, [[List of tanker explosions|nearly 200 people were killed in a tanker explosion in Juba]].<ref>{{Citation|last=Rubin|first=Jonathan M.|title=Liquefied Natural Gas Tanker Truck Explosion|date=2006|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-0-323-03253-7.50160-6|work=Disaster Medicine|pages=784–785|publisher=Elsevier|doi=10.1016/b978-0-323-03253-7.50160-6|isbn=9780323032537|access-date=2021-11-09}}</ref>

Since the beginning of the [[War in Sudan (2023–present)|2023 Sudan Conflict]], approximately 6,000 refugees have arrived in the city.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Miettaux |first=Florence |date=2023-09-08 |title=From garrison town to goldrush city: life in Africa's youngest capital |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/sep/08/city-of-hope-and-fear-life-in-africas-youngest-capital |access-date=2023-10-16 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Many settled in Gorom, an area near the city, and have struggled from lack of humanitarian aid.

==Government==
Juba is led by a [[city council]], formed in March 2011. The council was established by Governor [[Clement Wani Konga]] who appointed by Mohammed El Haj Baballa mayor of the council and former [[Yei River County|Yei]] County Commissioner [[David Lokonga Moses]] was appointed as deputy mayor. A ministerial committee to keep Juba clean and sanitary was also created by gubernatorial decree at the same time.<ref name="jubatown">{{cite news|url=http://www.gurtong.net/ECM/Editorial/tabid/124/ctl/ArticleView/mid/519/articleId/5065/CES-Governor-Appoints-Juba-Town-Mayor.aspx|title=CES Governor Appoints Mayor For Juba City Council|last=Stephen|first=Juma John|date=3 April 2011|access-date=28 July 2011|agency=Gurtong|archive-date=26 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426234551/http://www.gurtong.net/ECM/Editorial/tabid/124/ctl/ArticleView/mid/519/articleId/5065/CES-Governor-Appoints-Juba-Town-Mayor.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Prior to March 2011, the area now administered by Juba City Council was divided into Juba, Kator, and Muniki ''payams''. It is now a standalone subdivision of [[Juba County]],<ref name="jubatown" /> of which it is the county seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nilebuffalo.com/resource_detail.php?countryID=1|title=Central Equatoria State|year=2008|work=NileBuffalo Gazette|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110320051711/http://www.nilebuffalo.com/resource_detail.php?countryID=1|archive-date=20 March 2011|access-date=28 July 2011}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Sudan Juba bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Juba Bridge, a prefabricated [[Bailey bridge]] over the [[White Nile]]]]

The city is a river port and the southern terminus of traffic along the [[Nile]] (specifically along the Bahr-al-Ghazal portion of the [[White Nile]]).<ref name="Parsons">{{cite book |last1=Parsons |first1=Ellen C. |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.157281 |title=Christus Liberator: An Outline Study of Africa |date=1905 |publisher=Macmillan Company |page=[https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.157281/page/n20 7] |language=en |access-date=5 October 2017}}</ref> Before the civil war, Juba was also a transport hub, with highways connecting it to [[Kenya]], [[Uganda]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. 

Since the end of the war Juba has been unable to recover to its pre-war state and is no longer a significant trade city. Roads and the river harbour are no longer in use due to being in disrepair. The [[United Nations]] and the [[Government of South Sudan|South Sudanese government]] are working on repairing the roads, but a full repair is expected to take many years. In 2003, the [[Swiss Foundation for Mine Action]] (FSD) started to clear the roads leading from Juba to Uganda and Kenya. It was expected that these roads would be completely de-mined and rebuilt in the course of 2006–2008.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The rebuilding of the roads, which are mostly unpaved, takes a tremendous amount of effort and time because of the limited work season due to the lengthy rainy season, which lasts from March until October. The roads are important for the peace process in Sudan as people need them to return to their homes and to regain what they feel is a normal life. The first road that has started to be rebuilt is the road to Uganda. This road is particularly important, as many of the original inhabitants of Juba fled to Uganda during the war. {{As of|2009}}, there are three paved roads in Juba, one that was re-surfaced in July. The main one is a concrete road, built by the British in the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Between 2008 and 2011, the [[Government of Uganda|Ugandan government]] and the [[Southern Sudan autonomous region (2005–2011)|Southern Sudanese government]] undertook joint efforts to develop a railway link between the [[Northern Region, Uganda|Northern Ugandan]] city of [[Gulu]] and Juba, with an extension to [[Wau, Sudan|Wau]]. A memorandum of understanding between the two governments was signed to that effect in August 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pachodo.org/20080908783/Pachodo.org-English-Articles/gulu-nimule-juba-wau-railway-line-in-offing.html|title=Gulu – Juba Railway in the Offing|date=20 September 2010|publisher=Pachodo.org|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007041738/http://www.pachodo.org/20080908783/Pachodo.org-English-Articles/gulu-nimule-juba-wau-railway-line-in-offing.html|archive-date=7 October 2011|access-date=20 June 2012}}</ref> The same memorandum outlined plans to develop the road network between the two countries.

[[Juba International Airport]] {{Airport codes|JUB|HJJJ}} is the site of large numbers of flights bringing UN and [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) aid into [[South Sudan]], as well as passengers and general air freight. The construction of a new terminal was begun in late 2007 when the oil prices were very high ($100+). Since then – with the oil prices going back down – the fate of the new terminal is uncertain. Building on the new terminal restarted in early 2014.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} As of February 2014, there are daily flights to [[Jomo Kenyatta International Airport]] in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]]; [[Khartoum International Airport]] in Sudan; [[Entebbe International Airport]] in [[Entebbe]], [[Uganda]]; and [[Bole International Airport]] in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia. The [[United Nations Mission in South Sudan]] ([[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMISS]]) has a large compound near the Juba Airport.

==Demography==
In 2005, Juba's population was 163,442. Based on analysis of aerial photos, the best estimate of several donors working in Juba calculated the 2006 population at approximately 250,000. The 5th Sudan Population and Housing Census took place in April/May 2008, stating the population of [[Juba County]] to be 372,413 (the majority residing in Juba City, which dominates the [[counties of South Sudan|county]]), but the results were rejected by the [[Autonomous Government of Southern Sudan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article31746|title=South Sudan parliament throw outs census results|author=Isaac Vuni|date=8 July 2009|publisher=Sudan Tribune|access-date=8 July 2009|archive-date=12 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712230242/http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article31746|url-status=dead}}</ref> Juba is developing very rapidly due to oil money and the Chinese coming for work and development.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} In 2011, the population of the city of Juba is estimated at 372,410, but may potentially be more.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=Juba&lk=1&a=ClashPrefs_*City.*Juba.CentralEquatoria.Sudan--|title=Estimated Population in 2011|publisher=Wolframalpha.com|access-date=20 June 2012}}</ref> {{As of|2013}}, the city's population was growing at a rate of 4.23%.<ref name="The World Factbook: South Sudan">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/south-sudan/|title=The World Factbook: South Sudan|work=[[The World Factbook]]|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|access-date=2013-12-31}}</ref> The Juba City Council's CEO, Martin Simon Wani, has claimed the population exceeds one million with up to a million more living in surrounding suburbs.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Miettaux |first=Florence |date=8 September 2023 |title=From garrison town to goldrush city: life in Africa's youngest capital |language=en |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/sep/08/city-of-hope-and-fear-life-in-africas-youngest-capital |url-status=live |access-date=8 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230908061005/https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/sep/08/city-of-hope-and-fear-life-in-africas-youngest-capital |archive-date=8 September 2023 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref> Suburbs adjacent to Juba have become increasingly dense as people from the countryside move into the city for economic opportunities.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Miettaux |first=Florence |date=2023-09-08 |title=From garrison town to goldrush city: life in Africa's youngest capital |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2023/sep/08/city-of-hope-and-fear-life-in-africas-youngest-capital |access-date=2023-10-16 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Middle Juba Population, 1995-2013 - knoema.com |url=https://knoema.com//atlas/Somalia/Middle-Juba/Population |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=Knoema |language=en-US}}</ref>

Juba has been described as undergoing an economic boom, especially in the past five years and since independence.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}} The prospect of an economic boom has brought thousands of merchants to Juba, mostly from northern Sudan and from [[East Africa]]. {{as of|October 2010}}, several regional and international businesses have established a presence in Juba. The [[Commercial Bank of Ethiopia]] and the Kenyan banking conglomerate [[KCB Group|Kenya Commercial Bank]] has its South Sudanese headquarters in the city and a branch network of eleven branches throughout South Sudan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kcbbankgroup.com/su/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1&Itemid=1|title=About KCB Southern Sudan|date=4 March 2008|publisher=Kcbbankgroup.com|access-date=20 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320194732/http://www.kcbbankgroup.com/su/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1&Itemid=1|archive-date=20 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> The three indigenous South Sudanese commercial banks namely; [[Buffalo Commercial Bank]], [[Ivory Bank]] and [[Nile Commercial Bank]], all maintain their headquarters in Juba. [[Equity Bank Group|Equity Bank]], another regional finance services provider also has a branch in Juba. [[National Insurance Corporation]] (NIC), the leading Ugandan insurance services provider, maintains an office in the city.<ref>[http://www.nic.co.ug/pg.php?Id=6&p=media&s=news NIC Expands Into Sudan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516032406/http://www.nic.co.ug/pg.php?Id=6&p=media&s=news|date=16 May 2009}}</ref> Despite recent economic difficulties brought about by the [[South Sudanese Civil War|15 December 2013 civil war]], Juba has continued to grow and construction is still booming. This is probably due to the high demand for affordable housing and hotel accommodations. Research from the [[Overseas Development Institute]] found that markets in Juba are transient, as many traders only come to make a quick profit and so do not invest in storage facilities or shops.<ref>Irina Mosel and Emily Henderson (2015) [http://www.odi.org/publications/10000-markets-crises-south-sudan-case-study Markets in crises: South Sudan case study] London: Overseas Development Institute</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=umajulius |date=2024-03-05 |title=South Sudan economic cluster unveil plans to curb inflation |url=https://sudantribune.com/article282903/ |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=Sudan Tribune |language=en-US}}</ref>
