== Landmarks ==
Sabha is famous for the Fort Elena castle,<ref>Martin, B. G.

Fort Elena was previously known as Fortezza Margherita, built during the [[Italian North Africa|Italian colonial period]]. Currently the Italian-built fort is a military institution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agcnews.eu/libia-fortezza-margherita-salvataggio/ |title=Salvare la Fortezza Margherita |publisher=Agcnews.eu |date=25 March 2014 |access-date=26 November 2016 |language=it}}</ref> [[Sabha University]] is situated in the city.

== Transport ==
The city is served by [[Sabha Airport]], which underwent expansion in the late 1970s.<ref>{{cite book |title=Translations on Near East and North Africa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q_O5AAAAIAAJ |year=1977 |publisher=Joint Publications Research Service |page=31}}</ref> An {{convert|800|km|mi|abbr=on}} long railway has been proposed from Sabha to the port of [[Misrata]] for iron ore transport.<ref>''Xinhua News Agency'' (2008) "Chinese win Libya rail bidding" ''International Herald Tribune'' 19 February 2008, Finance Section, p. 13</ref>

== Reports of slave auctions ==
In 2017, The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees|United Nations Migration Agency]] reported that Sabha had turned into a modern-day slave auctioning town. Each slave (mostly migrants from countries to the south of Libya, especially [[Nigeria]]) was sold for around US$325, with reports up to 1000 such sales each month.<ref name="phil">{{cite news |last1=Hoad |first1=Phil |title=Sabha in the spotlight: the city where migrants are sold as slaves |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jun/19/sabha-spotlight-city-migrants-sold-slaves-world-refugee-day |access-date=21 June 2017 |work=The Guardian |date=19 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170620213412/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jun/19/sabha-spotlight-city-migrants-sold-slaves-world-refugee-day |archive-date=20 June 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> While this aspect of Sabha had been kept under check during the reign of [[Muammar Gaddafi]], it raised its head again due to the turbulence in Libya caused by the civil war. Most of the migrants came here escaping equally tragic conditions back home in [[Burkina Faso]], Nigeria and other [[West Africa|neighbouring African countries]].<ref name="emma" /> However, the National Commission for Human Rights in Libya (NCHRL) revealed that the media reports of slavery were exaggerated and that slave auctions were not public, as suggested by CNN.<ref name=libyaobserver>{{Cite web|url=https://www.libyaobserver.ly/news/libyan-human-rights-body-upset-over-cnn-report-slave-auctions-libya|title=Libyan human rights body upset over CNN report of slave auctions in Libya |newspaper=The Libya Observer |first1=Abdulkader |last1=Assad |date=Nov 18, 2017 }}</ref> The slave auctions which were discovered were revealed to be rare.<ref name=libyaobserver />
