'''Bello''' ({{IPA|es|ˈbeʎo}}, {{IPA|es|ˈbeʝo|}}) is a city and municipality in [[Antioquia Department]], Colombia and a suburb of [[Medellín]], the department capital. Bello is part of [[the Metropolitan Area of the Aburrá Valley]] in the department of Antioquia. It is bordered on the north by the municipality of San Pedro de los Milagros, on the east by the municipality of [[Copacabana (Colombia)|Copacabana]], on the south by the municipality of [[Medellin, Colombia|Medellín]] and on the west by the municipalities of Medellín and [[San Jerónimo, Colombia|San Jerónimo]].

It is the center of the development in the north of the [[Aburrá Valley]] ({{Langx|es|Valle de Aburrá}}), and as a member of the [[The Metropolitan Area of the Aburrá Valley|Metropolitan Area of Aburrá Valley]], or AMVA ({{Langx|es|Área Metropolitana del Valle de Aburrá|links=no}}), some public services are regulated for the [[Metropolitan area|Metropolitan Area]]. There are several nicknames for the municipality: Imperio del Cacique Niquia (Cacique Niquia's Empire), Cuna de Marco Fidel Suárez ("[[Marco Fidel Suárez]]'s cradle"), "Ciudad de los artistas" ("Artist's city").

==History==
Meaning "Beautiful" in English, Bello was founded in 1676 as "Hato Viejo".  [[Antioquia Department|The department]] later changed its name to Bello in honor of Latin American polymath [[Andrés Bello]] (1781-1865). Bello was granted municipal status in 1913, officially making it one of the cities of Antioquia Department.

Bello is also known as the "City of Artists" in Colombia. Its current mayor is Carlos Alirio Muñoz López.

In July 1541, troops under the command of [[Jerónimo Luis Tejelo]] (Deputy Marshal to [[Jorge Robledo]]) found the wide valley of Los Aburrá inhabited by indigenous farmers who had "a habitat organized in groups with scattered houses, forming clusters of houses". This was especially true in the town of Niquías, which occupied the territory now called Bello.

In 1574, the Spanish subject [[Gaspar de Rodas]] requested a land grant for the Aburrá Valley from the town hall of Santa Fe de Antioquia in order to establish therein "herds of livestock and agricultural plots", in order to provide food for the conquest. He was awarded the territories from the hill or "Asientos viejos de Aburrá" – an area which is now occupied by the Medellin town center – down, including the Niquía territory. In 1576, the captain of Rodas came to exercise control over the area from the Spanish Crown, permitting the use of the territory for corrals, ranches and flocks. From 1613 onward, the area began to be called Hatoviejo instead of Hato de Rodas or Hato de Aburrá to distinguish it from later herds.
[[File:Capilla de Hatoviejo-Bello.JPG|thumb|left|Chapel of Nuestra Señora del Rosario in Hatoviejo, better known as the Hatoviejo Chapel.]]

In this context the colonizers exercised their chivalry, understood as "that noble philosophy that reacted against innovations." Thus they endowed their farms with chapels to signify prestige and noble origin and so it can be inferred that in Bello the colony was not given a foundation that "involve a regular pattern of squares and streets. Hatoviejo was not a village as it was in the beginning the town of Candelaria." The chapels that were constructed were [[Our Lady of Chiquinquirá]] (in 1653) [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] (1720), Our Lady of Sopetrán (in Madera, 1775) and [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]] (in Fontidueño, 1761). Later these temples were moved or demolished, as happened with the Hatoviejo Parish Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, demolished in 1788 in order to build the Chapel of Hatoviejo in 1792, which still stands. At the end of the eighteenth century, in 1788, Hatoviejo was elevated to the status of party, assigned to the jurisdiction of the town of Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria in [[Medellin]].

[[File:Apartamentos en el municipio de bello.JPG|thumb|left|Apartments at the Bello exit.]]
In Hatoviejo the land was organized according to the economic role of its people. The reference to "Calle arriba" (Up the road) and "Calle Abajo," (down the road) was common. The square and the Church of the Rosary were used as the central point. On 28 December 1883 the "Ciudadano Presidente " of the Antioquia State renamed the village from Hatoviejo to Bello, at the request of a group of people who felt that the name "Hato" made them despised and humiliated as ''hato'' was a place for animals. Instead, the name Bello was "more cultured, more appropriate and more worthy of the great patriarch of American letters" ([[Andrés Bello]]).

==Geography==
[[File:Amanecer (Bello).JPG|thumb|left|Dawn on 10 June 2012, in Bello]]
Bello forms part of the Aburrá Valley, a valley in the Andes mountain range. It is located next to Medellín at its northern border in the Valley of Aburrá. The climate is warm and is affected by gentle winds throughout the year.

The city has a total area of 142.36&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of which 19.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> are urban land and 122.66&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is rural land. This valley is fully urbanized in the plains, and very busy on its slopes. In the valley it is crossed by the Medellín River, which runs south–north, and its 57 streams throughout its 70 kilometers.

Topographically the urban part of the city is a tilted plane that descends from 1600 to 1400 meters above sea level. Bello is in the northern part of the valley and the mountains surrounding the city exceed 2,500 meters.

The main topographic feature is the Cerro Quitasol (pyramidal mountain, 2,880 meters above sea level), located north of the city and considered by its grandeur as the tutelary hill of Bello.

===Climate===
The city, being located in the tropics, does not experience climatic changes. The average rainfall is 1347&nbsp;mm., The temperature is determined by climatic zones ranging from desert, through cold up to medium where he is the highest, which has an average temperature of 25.7&nbsp;°C throughout the year, alternating between dry and wet periods and is cooled by winds that blow along the valley throughout the year.

Additionally the area receives trade winds that blow from the lower valleys of the [[Cauca river]] to the west and the [[Magdalena river]] to the east and middle, creating a dense layer of warm air, which causes the lower part of the town and some surrounding areas to increase in humidity and increase barometric temperature. As a result of the wind, northern municipalities such as Bello, [[Copacabana, Antioquia|Copacabana]], [[Girardota]] and [[Barbosa, Antioquia|Barbosa]] are warmer than the Antioquia capital of [[Medellin]], despite its proximity.
