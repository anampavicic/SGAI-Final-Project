A [[college town]], Ann Arbor is currently home to the University of Michigan, which significantly shapes the city's economy, employing about 30,000 workers which includes about 12,000 in its [[University of Michigan Health System|medical center]]. The city's economy is also centered on high technology, with several companies drawn to the area by the university's research and development infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://annarborusa.org/why-ann-arbor/industries/ | title=Why Ann Arbor: Industries | publisher=Ann Arbor Spark | year=2024 | accessdate=August 12, 2024}}</ref> The city has been a center for progressive politics as well as several social and religious movements.

Ann Arbor is included in the [[Metro Detroit|Detroit-Warren-Ann Arbor combined statistical area]] and the [[Great Lakes megalopolis]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Ann Arbor, Michigan}}
=== Before founding as Ann Arbor ===
The lands of present-day Ann Arbor were part of [[Massachusetts]]'s [[state cessions|western claim]] after the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763), bounded by the latitudes of [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]'s original charter, to which it was entitled by its interpretation of its original [[sea-to-sea grant]] from the [[British Crown]]. [[Massachusetts]]  ceded the claim to the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] as part of the [[Northwest Territory]] after April 19, 1785.<ref name="walker-cessions">Walker, p.65</ref><ref name="vz-ma">Van Zandt, pp. 65–71</ref>

The region was once inhabited by several [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American tribes]], the most prominent being the [[Anishinaabe]] people of the Three Fires — the [[Odawa]], [[Ojibwe]], and [[Potawatomi]]. The Potawatomi founded two villages in the area of what is now Ann Arbor in about 1774.<ref>{{citation|last=Edmonds|first= R. David |year=1978 |title=The Potawatomis: Keepers of the Fire |publisher= University of Oklahoma |page= 99}}</ref> Other tribes that inhabited the area included the [[Fox people|Fox]], [[Wyandot people|Wyandots]], and [[Sauk people|Sauk]].<ref>{{cite book | title=The Indians of Washtenaw County, Michigan | author=Hinsdale, W. B. | year=1927 | publisher=Ann Arbor, Mich.,: G. Wahr}}</ref> These peoples established several trails that converged on present-day Ann Arbor. The land that included Washtenaw County was ceded to the U.S. by the Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, and Wyandot in the [[Treaty of Detroit]] of 1807.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2024/05/on-stolen-land-before-ann-arbor-was-ann-arbor-it-was-home-to-native-americans.html | title=‘On stolen land.’ Before Ann Arbor was Ann Arbor, it was home to Native Americans | publisher=MLive.com | author=Stanton, Ryan | date=May 19, 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241008202230/https://www.mlive.com/news/ann-arbor/2024/05/on-stolen-land-before-ann-arbor-was-ann-arbor-it-was-home-to-native-americans.html | archive-date=October 8, 2024}}</ref>

In 1960, Ann Arbor voters approved a $2.3 million [[Bond (finance)|bond issue]] to build the current city hall, which was designed by architect [[Alden B. Dow]]. The City Hall opened in 1963. In 1995, the building was renamed the Guy C.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the city gained a reputation as an important center for liberal politics. Ann Arbor also became a locus for left-wing activism and [[Opposition to U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War|anti-Vietnam War movement]], as well as the student movement. The first major meetings of the national left-wing campus group [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] took place in Ann Arbor in 1960; in 1965, the city was home to the first U.S. [[teach-in]] against the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Marwil, p. 153</ref> During the ensuing 15 years, many [[counterculture|countercultural]] and [[New Left]] enterprises sprang up and developed large constituencies within the city.<ref name="aadl2006">{{cite web | url=http://moaa.aadl.org/moaa/pictorial_history/1940-1974pg3 | title=1940–1974: From Protest to Outer Space.

Ann Arbor has a long history of openness to marijuana, given Ann Arbor's decriminalization of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], the large number of [[medical marijuana]] dispensaries in the city (one dispensary, called People's Co-op, was directly across the street from [[Michigan Stadium]] until zoning forced it to move one mile to the west), the large number of pro-marijuana residents, and the annual [[Hash Bash]]: an event that is held on the first Saturday of April. Until (at least) the successful passage of Michigan's medical marijuana law, the event had arguably strayed from its initial intent, although for years, a number of attendees have received serious legal responses due to marijuana use on University of Michigan property, which does not fall under the city's progressive and compassionate ticketing program.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.annarbor.com/news/40-years-of-hash-bash-marijuana-festival-that-started-in-early-1970s-still-going-strong-in-ann-arbor/ | title=40 years of Hash Bash: Marijuana festival started in 1972 in Ann Arbor stands test of time | publisher=Ann Arbor.com | date=March 31, 2011 | access-date=August 4, 2012| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231055000/http://www.annarbor.com/news/40-years-of-hash-bash-marijuana-festival-that-started-in-early-1970s-still-going-strong-in-ann-arbor/ | archive-date=December 31, 2013 }}</ref>

The streets in downtown Ann Arbor conform to a [[grid pattern]], though this pattern is less common in the surrounding areas. Major roads branch out from the downtown district to the highways surrounding the city. The city is belted by three freeways: [[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]], which runs along the southern and western portion of the city; [[U.S. Route 23 in Michigan|U.S. Highway 23]] (US&nbsp;23), which primarily runs along the eastern edge of Ann Arbor; and [[M-14 (Michigan highway)|M-14]], which runs along the northern edge of the city. Other nearby highways include [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan|US&nbsp;12]] (Michigan Ave.), [[M-17 (Michigan highway)|M-17]] (Washtenaw Ave.), and [[M-153 (Michigan highway)|M-153]] (Ford Rd.). Several of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 interchange in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas.<ref name="MDOT07">{{cite map|publisher=[[Michigan Department of Transportation]] |title=Official 2007 Department of Transportation Map |url=http://www.michigan.gov/mdot/0,1607,7-151-9622_11033_11151---,00.html |year=2007 |scale=1&nbsp;in:15&nbsp;mi/1&nbsp;cm:9&nbsp;km |section=C1–C11 |access-date=August 4, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502044505/http://michigan.gov/mdot/0%2C1607%2C7-151-9622_11033_11151---%2C00.html |archive-date= May 2, 2014 }}</ref> The Washtenaw County [[Border-to-Border Trail]] connects Ann Arbor to Ypsilanti, mostly along the Huron River, for pedestrians, bicycles and other non-motorized transportation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Explore the Border to Border Trail |url=https://b2btrail.org/explore-the-trail/ |access-date=April 20, 2023 |website=Border to Border |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first=Eric |last=Gallippo |date=December 14, 2016 |title=B2B Trail, Ypsi bike lanes to expand in 2017 |url=https://www.secondwavemedia.com/concentrate/devnews/nonmotorized0391.aspx |access-date=April 20, 2023 |website=Concentrate |language=en}}</ref>
