=== Archaeology ===
In November 2019, 45 well-preserved tombs covering a 50-80 square metre area and a settlement, dating back to beginning of the [[Iron Age]], were discovered in [[Al-Mudhaibi]] by archaeologists from [[Oman]] and [[Heidelberg University]]. Archaeologists believed that the site belonged to the miners who were working in copper mining.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Iron Age Tombs Discovered in Oman {{!}} ARCHAEOLOGY WORLD|url=https://archaeology-world.com/new-archaeological-site-discovered-in-oman/|access-date=2020-09-17|language=en-GB}}</ref>

==Ecology==
Of particular [[Tourism|touristic]] interest is the coast, which includes the headlands of [[Ras al Hadd|Raʾs al-Ḥadd]] and Raʾs al-Ghaimah ({{langx|ar|رَأْس ٱلْغَيْمَة}}). The stretch of [[beach]] ({{convert|42|km|mile|abbr=off}}) between these two places is the most significant [[Green turtle#Indo-Pacific subpopulation|nesting ground]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] for [[green turtle]]s. An estimated 13,000 [[turtle]]s lay their individual clutches of 80 to 100 [[egg]]s annually.<ref>Rouchiche, S. (October 2003).
