Retrieved 29 January 2021</ref> more formally the '''Canton of Vaud''', is one of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|26 cantons]] forming the [[Switzerland|Swiss Confederation]]. It is composed of [[Subdivisions of the canton of Vaud|ten districts]]; its capital city is [[Lausanne]]. Its coat of arms bears the motto "Liberté et patrie" on a white-green bicolour.

Vaud is the third-largest Swiss canton by population and fourth by size. It is located in [[Romandy]], the [[French language|French]]-speaking western part of the country, and borders the canton of [[canton of Neuchâtel|Neuchâtel]] to the north, the cantons of [[Canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]] and [[Canton of Bern|Bern]] to the east, the canton of [[Valais]] to the south, the canton of [[canton of Geneva|Geneva]] to the south-west, and [[France]]<!--More details in geography section--> to the west. The geography of the canton includes all three natural regions of Switzerland: the [[Jura Mountains]], the [[Swiss Plateau]], and the [[Swiss Alps|(Swiss) Alps]]. It also includes some of the largest lakes of the country: [[Lake Geneva]] and [[Lake Neuchâtel]]. It is a major tourist destination, renowned for its landscapes and gastronomy.

The largest city is [[Lausanne]], followed by [[Yverdon-les-Bains]] and [[Montreux]]. As of {{Swiss populations Y|CH-VD|CH-VD}}, the canton has a population of {{Swiss populations|CH-VD|CH-VD}}.{{Swiss populations ref|CH-VD|CH-VD}} It is one of the four<!--VD, GE, NE, JU--> cantons where [[French language|French]] is the sole official language, and it is the canton with the largest number of French speakers. Formerly a Bernese bailiwick, Vaud joined the Swiss Confederation as an independent canton in 1803.

==History==
{{See also|Barony of Vaud}}
[[File:Roman_column_-_Nyon,_Vaud,_Switzerland.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Roman column in Nyon]]
[[File:Karte Bernische-Vogteien-Kanton-Waadt en.png|thumb|Bailiwicks of Bern in Vaud in the 18th century]]
Humans lived alongside the Vaud lakes in prehistoric times. Later, the [[Celtic people|Celtic]] tribe of the [[Helvetii]] inhabited the area. [[Julius Caesar|Caesar]]'s troops defeated the Helvetii in 58 BC and as a consequence the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] settled in the area. The many towns established by the Romans include [[Vevey]] ({{langx|la| Viviscus}}) and Lausanne (''Lausonium'' or ''Lausonna'').

While the exact date of the founding of Aventicum is not exact, it was likely established during or shortly after Augustus' reign. There are still many Roman remains around the town today. Between the 2nd and the 4th centuries [[Alemanni]]c tribes repeatedly invaded the area, and in the 5th century the [[Burgundians]] occupied the territory. The [[Merovingian]] Franks later replaced the Burgundians. Their control did not last long either, and in 888 the area of the canton of Vaud became part of the [[Carolingian Empire]] (the successor state to the Merovingians). In 1032 the [[House of Zähringen|Zähringen]]s of Germany defeated the Burgundians. The Zähringens themselves were succeeded in 1218 by the counts of [[County of Savoy|Savoy]]. It was only under the counts of Savoy that the area gained political unity as the [[Barony of Vaud]]. A part stretching from [[Attalens]] to the river [[Saane/Sarine|Sarine]], in the north, was absorbed by the canton of Fribourg.

[[File:Lausanne Saint-Maire.jpg|thumb|upright| Built by the Bishop of [[Bishopric of Lausanne|Lausanne]] during the 15th century, [[Château Saint-Maire]] has been the seat of the cantonal government since 1803]]
As the power of the [[House of Savoy]] declined at the beginning of the 15th century, troops from [[Bern]] occupied the land. By 1536 Bern had completely annexed the area. Vaud's [[Protestant Reformation]] started with co-workers of [[John Calvin]] like [[Pierre Viret]] (a famous debate took place at the cathedral of Lausanne), but it was only decisively implemented when Bern put its full force behind it.

The Bernese occupiers were not popular amongst the population. In 1723 Major [[Abraham Davel]] led a revolt against Bern, in protest at what he saw as the denial of political rights of the French-speaking Vaudois by the German-speaking Bernese; he was subsequently beheaded.<ref name = HistoiredelaSuisse>''Histoire de la Suisse'', Éditions Fragnière, Fribourg, Switzerland.</ref> Later, inspired by the [[French Revolution]] of 1789–1799, the Vaudois drove out the Bernese governor in 1798 and declared the [[Lemanic Republic]]. Vaud nationalists like [[Frédéric-César de La Harpe]], born in Rolle, had called for French intervention in liberating the area, and French Revolutionary troops moved in, taking over the whole of Switzerland itself in the process and setting up the [[Helvetic Republic]]. Under [[Napoleon I]] (Emperor 1804–1815), Vaud became (1798–1803) the [[canton of Léman]]. Unrest about the abolition of [[Feudalism|feudal]] rights and taxes led to increased discontent, which culminated in the revolt of the [[Bourla-papey]] in spring 1802, closely followed by the [[Stecklikrieg]] (August to October 1802) that brought the end of the entire Helvetic Republic in 1803. In 1803 Vaud joined the re-installed [[Swiss Confederation (Napoleonic)|Swiss Confederation]]. In spite of Bernese attempts to reclaim Vaud, it has remained a sovereign canton ever since.

In the 19th century, the canton of Vaud was an outspoken opponent of the [[Sonderbund war|''Sonderbund'']] Catholic separatist movement, which led to intervention by 99,000 Swiss Federal troops under General [[Guillaume Henri Dufour|Henri Dufour]] against 79,000 separatists, in the Sonderbund War (November 1847). Separation was prevented at the cost of very few lives.

The current cantonal constitution dates from 14 April 2003, replacing the constitution of 1885.<ref>

==Geography==
[[File:LakeGenevaVeveyMontreux.jpg|thumb|[[Vevey]], [[Lake Geneva]], and the [[Swiss Alps]]]]
[[File:Joux.jpg|thumb|[[Vallée de Joux]], Jura]]
[[File:Montreux - Lake Geneva.jpg|thumb|[[Montreux]] and Lake Geneva]]
The canton stretches from [[Lake Neuchâtel]] in the north, where it borders the [[canton of Neuchâtel]], to [[Lake Geneva]] ({{langx|fr|Léman}}) in the south, where it borders the [[canton of Geneva]], the French [[départements|department]] of [[Haute-Savoie]] (lake border) and the [[canton of Valais]] ([[Chablais]]). In the [[Jura mountains]] in the west, the canton borders the French departments of [[Ain]], [[Jura (département)|Jura]], and [[Doubs (department)|Doubs]]. In the east, it borders the cantons of [[canton of Fribourg|Fribourg]] and [[canton of Bern|Bern]]. The total area is {{convert|3212|km2|sqmi|0}}.

Along with the canton of Berne, Vaud is one of the two cantons whose territory extends from the Jura to the Alps, through the three distinct [[Geography of Switzerland|geographic regions of Switzerland]].

The areas in the south east are mountainous, situated on the north side of the [[Bernese Alps]]. This region is commonly named the ''Vaud Alps'' ({{langx|fr|Alpes Vaudoises}}). The [[Diablerets]] massif, peaking at {{convert|3210|m|ft|0}}, is the highest mountain of the canton. Other summits such as the [[Grand Muveran]] and the [[Tour d'Aï]] are visible from most of the canton. The area also hosts several popular skiing destinations such as [[Villars-sur-Ollon|Villars]], [[Les Diablerets (Ormont-Dessus)|Les Diablerets]] and [[Leysin]].

The central area of the canton, in contrast, consists of [[moraine]]s and is hilly. There are plains along the lakes. In the north, Avenches is in an [[exclave]] of the canton surrounded by the canton of Fribourg and Lake Neuchâtel. On the other hand, there are three enclaves of the [[Cantons of Switzerland|canton]] of Fribourg (Estavayer-le-lac, Vuissens, Surpierre), as well as two enclaves of the canton of [[Geneva]] (Céligny), that are surrounded by the canton of Vaud.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.vaud.ch/en/canton-of-vaud/geographical-location/ |title = Vaud.ch - Bienvenue dans le canton de Vaud}}</ref>

The north-western part of the canton is also mountainous but in a more modest way with mountains generally not above {{convert|1500|m|||}}; the [[Jura Mountains]]. The [[Vallée de Joux]] is one of the most popular destinations in the region and also a centre of luxury mechanical [[Swiss Made|Swiss watch]] manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.watchvalley.ch/e/home/ |title=Watch Valley - Home |access-date=26 June 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724155618/http://www.watchvalley.ch/e/home/ |archive-date=24 July 2009 }}</ref>

The population is [[French language|French]]-speaking and historically was mostly [[Protestant]] (Calvinist), dating from the early years of the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].

The [[Capital (political)|capital]], [[Lausanne]], is the major city of the canton. There are light industries concentrated around it. In 1998, 71.7% of the workers worked in the tertiary sector and 20.8% in the secondary.

The canton is the second-largest producer of [[wine]] in Switzerland. Most of the wine produced in the canton is white, and most vineyards are located on the steep shores of Lake Geneva such as the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] the [[Lavaux|Lavaux Vineyard Terraces]]. There is agriculture in the areas away from Lake Geneva. Sugar beet is important around [[Orbe]], tobacco in [[La Broye Valley]], and fruit at the foot of the [[Jura mountains]]. Cattle breeding and pasture are common in the [[Alps]] and the Jura mountains. There is a [[salt mine]] at [[Bex]]. Tourism is important in many towns along Lake Geneva. Major lakeside resorts include Lausanne, [[Montreux]], and [[Vevey]].
