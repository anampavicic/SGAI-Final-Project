At the outset of the [[First Congo War]], South Kivu played a key role as a battleground for the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] (AFDL), led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]]. Its [[plateau]]s and [[hill]]s served as strategic [[Fortification|strongholds]] for the advancing AFDL forces, who aimed to pursue [[Hutu]] [[refugee]]s, particularly the ex-[[Rwanda Defence Force|FAR]]/[[Interahamwe]], while simultaneously seeking to overthrow [[Mobutu Sese Seko|Mobutu]]'s government. This response was prompted by the mistreatment of [[Tutsi]] civilians under Mobutu's regime, which subjected them to [[Arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrests]] and [[Detention (imprisonment)|detentions]] conducted by [[Civil Guard (Zaire)|Zairian police]] and [[Zairian Armed Forces|soldiers]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://numerique.banq.qc.ca/patrimoine/details/52327/2159842 |title=Ending the Indifference!: Sexual Violence During the 1993-2003 Armed Conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo |publisher=Rights & Democracy |year=2011 |isbn=9782923539461 |location=Burlington, Vermont |pages=24–27 |language=English}}</ref><ref name="mapping-report.org">{{Cite web |title=Attacks against other civilian populations - South Kivu |url=https://www.mapping-report.org/en/aattacks-against-other-civilian-populations-south-kivu/ |access-date=2023-05-27 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Kisangani |first=Emizet F. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sj9mDQAAQBAJ |title=Historical Dictionary of the Democratic Republic of the Congo |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield Publishers |date=November 18, 2016 |isbn=9781442273160 |location=Lanham, Maryland |pages=66 |language=English}}</ref>

The war officially ended in 2003 with the signing of the [[Sun City Agreement]], which aimed to establish a [[Transitional Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|transitional government]] and promote [[Peacebuilding|peace and stability]] in the DRC.

==== War and human rights ====
The [[Banyamulenge]], who actively aligned themselves with the AFDL and RCD factions throughout the duration of the [[Second Congo War]], have been subject to widespread [[Contempt|disdain]] among many Congolese due to their alleged involvement in a range of nefarious activities. These accusations include launching assaults on [[refugee camp]]s and [[Population density|densely populated villages]], engaging in [[Extrajudicial killing|civilian executions]], and orchestrating acts of [[terrorism]] targeting Zairian civilians across various regions of South and North Kivu. Consequently, a considerable number of Congolese view the Banyamulenge as unwelcome intruders encroaching upon their native territories, thereby intensifying the deep-rooted animosity directed towards them.<ref>{{Cite web |title=RDC: Minembwe, la commune de la discorde |url=https://blogs.mediapart.fr/afrikarabia/blog/071020/rdc-minembwe-la-commune-de-la-discorde |access-date=2023-05-28 |website=Mediapart |date=7 October 2020 |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Kisangani in the Congo War |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2002/drc2/DRC0802-02.htm |access-date=2023-05-28 |website=www.hrw.org}}</ref>

South Kivu Province is characterized by numerous [[river]]s, [[lake]]s, and [[waterway]]s that crisscross through its landscapes. The region lies in the center of the [[African Great Lakes]], encompassed by [[Lake Kivu]] towards the west and sharing its border with the [[Virunga National Park]] on the east. The [[Ruzizi River]], one of the longest rivers in the world, flows along the province's eastern edge. Meanwhile, its tributaries—the [[Sange River|Sange]], Kavinvira, Kavimvira, Luvimvi, Luvungi, Luvubu, Luberizi, Runingu, Mulongwe, Kiliba, Kalimabenge, and Lugulu Rivers—run through the verdant terrains, nurturing the surrounding ecosystems and supporting [[Agriculture|farming activities]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_N2tEAAAQBAJ |title=Goat Science: Environment, Health and Economy |publisher=IntechOpen |date=January 18, 2023 |isbn=9781789847086 |editor-last=Kukovics |editor-first=Sándor |location=London, England |pages=178 |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Perrin |first=Mike |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=grBjDwAAQBAJ |title=Parrots of Africa, Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands: Biology, Ecology and Conservation |publisher=Wits University Press |date=December 2012 |isbn=9781868145911 |location=Johannesburg, South Africa |pages=369 |language=English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Memoire Online - La problématique des accusations des viols et violences sexuelles en territoire d'Uvira.

While the province is rich in [[natural resource]]s, it is also fraught with challenges and dangers. The area is susceptible to [[Flood|periodic floods]], particularly during the [[Wet season|rainy season]], which cause disruptions to both the community and infrastructure. Over the last few years, parts of the province have been ravaged by flooding. In March 2020–23, torrential rains and the overflow of nearby tributaries inundated homes, including the [[Sange, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Sange]] and [[Uvira]], located in [[Uvira Territory]]. These regions experienced severe flooding, resulting in a sudden surge of water that overwhelmed the local infrastructure and communities. The force of the [[flood]]waters led to the collapse of many houses, leaving families homeless and vulnerable. The aftermath of the flooding also led to the displacement of people who sought refuge in temporary shelters or with relatives in safer areas.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Church aids flood survivors in Congo |url=https://www.umnews.org/en/news/church-aids-flood-survivors-in-congo |access-date=2023-06-28 |website=United Methodist News Service |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-03-26 |title=26 mars, Sange dans la province du Sud-Kivu, l'affaissement du pont perturbe la vie socio-économique de la population. |url=https://www.radiondenganews.net/2022/03/26/26-mars-sange-dans-la-province-du-sud-kivu-laffaissement-du-pont-perturbe-la-vie-socio-economique-de-la-population/ |access-date=2023-06-28 |website=NDENGA NEWS |language=fr-FR}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=DRC: Disruptions due to flooding ongoing in Uvira, South Kivu Province, as of Jan. 16 |url=https://crisis24.garda.com/alerts/2023/01/drc-disruptions-due-to-flooding-ongoing-in-uvira-south-kivu-province-as-of-jan-16 |access-date=2023-06-28 |website=DRC: Disruptions due to flooding ongoing in Uvira, South Kivu Province, as of Jan. 16 {{!}} Crisis24 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=DR Congo – Dozens Feared Dead After Floods Cause "Immeasurable Damage" in South Kivu – FloodList |url=https://floodlist.com/africa/dr-congo-floods-south-kivu-may-2023 |access-date=2023-06-28 |website=floodlist.com}}</ref>

Similarly, other areas in South Kivu Province also faced the wrath of floods, including [[Nyambasha]], Bushushu, Rambira, and Nyamukubi in [[Kalehe Territory]].

The province also includes parts of the [[Albertine Rift]], a branch of the larger [[East African Rift|East African Rift System]]. This rift valley is characterized by [[Plate tectonics|tectonic forces]] that led to the stretching and thinning of the [[Earth's crust]], resulting in the formation of deep [[valley]]s and [[Escarpment|steep escarpments]]. The rift valley is associated with the presence of lakes, including [[Lake Kivu]] and [[Lake Tanganyika]], which are major features of the landscape in South Kivu Province.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rYXfBwAAQBAJ |title=The East African Great Lakes: Limnology, Palaeolimnology and Biodiversity |publisher=Springer Netherlands |date=March 9, 2006 |isbn=9780306482014 |editor-last=Olago |editor-first=Daniel O. |location=Dordrecht, Netherlands |pages=19 |language=English |editor-last2=Odada |editor-first2=Eric O.}}</ref> In addition to volcanic and rift valley formations, the province also contains [[sedimentary basin]]s.

=== Climate ===
The province's eastern mountainous region experiences a mild mountain climate with a 3 to 4-month dry season from June to September.<ref name=":7">{{Cite web |title=Tout savoir sur la Province du Sud Kivu/Tribus, ethnies, exetat par territoire |trans-title=Everything you need to know about the South Kivu Province/Tribes, ethnic groups, exetat by territory |url=https://www.congovirtuel.com/page_province_sud_kivu.php |access-date=2024-01-10 |website=www.congovirtuel.com |language=French}}</ref> Cities like [[Bukavu]] and [[Uvira]] maintain an average annual temperature of 19&nbsp;°C, while higher plateaus and mountains, such as [[Minembwe]] and Kahuzi-Biéga National Park, are even cooler, fostering layered and [[Grass mountain|grassy mountain]] [[vegetation]].<ref name=":7" />

Conversely, the central and western parts, including territories like [[Shabunda Territory|Shabunda]] and [[Mwenga Territory|Mwenga]], feature an [[Tropical rainforest climate|equatorial climate]] dominated by dense [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|equatorial forests]], with abundant rainfall throughout the year.<ref name=":7" /> The [[Ruzizi Plain]], however, presents a unique [[Microclimate|micro-climate]]—a tropical climate with a dry tendency and lower rainfall (± 1,000&nbsp;mm/year). The region's [[vegetation]] is characterized by a grassy [[savanna]]h with thorns and ''[[Myrtillocactus geometrizans]]'', most notably in the Kahuzi-Biéga National Park.<ref name=":7" />

Administratively, the South Kivu Province is divided into [[Territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|territories]], [[Chiefdoms and sectors of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|chiefdoms or sectors]], ''groupements'' (groupings), and villages:

=== Territories ===
{{See also|Territories of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
Territories serve as the extensive arms of state administration, functioning as representatives of the [[central government]]. Each territory within the province is led by a Territorial Administrator and two Assistant Territorial Administrators.<ref name=":7" /> Recognizing the vastness of the territories, administrative management positions are established, headed by resident assistant territorial administrators or administrative management position leaders, aiming to bridge the gap between governance and the governed.<ref name=":7" /> Appointed by the [[Ministry of the Interior and Security (Democratic Republic of the Congo)|Ministry of the Interior]], territorial officials are included in the state's budgetary provisions. While they directly report to the Ministry of the Interior, they are also accountable to the [[List of provincial governors of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|governor]], who acts as the representative of both the President in the province and the Ministry of the Interior. The primary role of territorial administrators is to represent the state at the local level and oversee chiefdoms (''collectivités'').<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |last=Mushi |first=Ferdinand Mugumo |date=January 2013 |title=Insecurity and Local Governance in Congo's South Kivu |url=https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/20.500.12413/7398/IDSB_44_1_10.1111-1759-5436.12004.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |access-date=2023-06-28 |website=IDS OpenDocs |page=17 |language=English}}</ref>

South Kivu Province is divided into eight territories:
* [[Fizi Territory|Fizi]] (15,788&nbsp;km²), capital ''Fizi'' town; 
* [[Idjwi Territory|Idjwi]] (281&nbsp;km²), this is an island in [[Lake Kivu]]; 
* [[Kabare Territory|Kabare]] (1,960&nbsp;km²), 
* [[Kalehe Territory|Kalehe]] (5,126&nbsp;km²),
* [[Mwenga Territory|Mwenga]] (11,172&nbsp;km²),
* [[Shabunda Territory|Shabunda]] (25,116&nbsp;km²),
* [[Uvira Territory|Uvira]] (3,148&nbsp;km²), capital ''Uvira'' town; 
* [[Walungu Territory|Walungu]] (1,800&nbsp;km²),

===Cities===
In the legal view, the province has three major cities of importance: [[Baraka, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Baraka]] ([[Fizi Territory]]), [[Bukavu]] (Provincial Capital) and [[Uvira]] ([[Uvira Territory]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.minisanterdc.cd/inspectiondistrictetzonedesante/sudkivu.htm |title=Découpage des zones de santé du Sud Kivu |access-date=2008-03-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321044231/http://www.minisanterdc.cd/inspectiondistrictetzonedesante/sudkivu.htm |archive-date=2008-03-21 }}</ref> The northern city of [[Minova]] grew exponentially from 1994 through 2012 with a steady influx of refugees as a result of the disruption of the [[Rwandan genocide]] and the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s, and continued fighting in the area.<ref>{{Cite web|title=HOT Activation, South and North Kivu, Democratic Republic of Congo|date=16 December 2012|publisher=Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team|url=http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2012-12-12_hot_pre_activation_south_and_north_kivu_democratic_republic_of_congo|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130108053257/http://hot.openstreetmap.org/updates/2012-12-12_hot_pre_activation_south_and_north_kivu_democratic_republic_of_congo|archive-date=8 January 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city of Bukavu has experienced an exponential urban growth since colonial times. Sadiki et al. (2010) report about 620,000 inhabitants for 2008. The population growth rate increased incredibly in 2002 due to the entry of massive population from [[Goma]] after the [[Nyiragongo]] eruption of 17 January 2002.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Cishugi|first1=Bahati|last2=Dunia|first2=Kalegamire|last3=Ozer|first3=Pierre|last4=Ozer|first4=André|last5=Moeyersons|first5=Jan|last6=Vandecasteele|first6=Ine|last7=Ndyanabo|first7=Sadiki|date=2010|title=Développement de la ville de Bukavu et cartographie des vulnérabilités, R.D.

=== Chiefdoms and sectors ===
{{See also|Chiefdoms and sectors of the Democratic Republic of the Congo}}
[[Traditional authority]] is vested in [[Chiefdoms and sectors of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|chieftaincies]], also known as collectivities (''collectivités'') or sectors. The selection of the powerholder within a chiefdom or sector is determined by ethnic traditions and later recognized or formalized by the state, following traditional rules. The leader of a chiefdom carries the honored title of "[[mwami]]" (king). The chiefdom is further subdivided into ''Groupements'' (groupings), which extend the reach of traditional authority to regrouped villages. The village chiefs are responsible for overseeing the administration and governance within their respective areas.<ref name=":5" />
