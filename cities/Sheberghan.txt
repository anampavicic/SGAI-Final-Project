'''Sheberghān''' or '''Shaburghān''' or '''shāhpurgān''' ([[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Pashto language|Pashto]], {{langx|fa|شبرغان}}), also spelled ''Shebirghan'' and ''Shibarghan'', is the [[capital city]] of the [[Jowzjan Province]] in northern [[Afghanistan]].

The city of Sheberghan has a population of 175,599.<ref name="auto"/> It has four districts and a total land area of 7,335 hectares.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|title=The State of Afghan Cities report 2015|url=http://unhabitat.org/books/soac2015_volume2/|ref=UN-Habitat}}</ref> The total number of dwellings in Sheberghān is 19,511.<ref name="auto1"/>

In 2021, the [[Taliban]] gained control of the city during the [[2021 Taliban offensive]].

==Location==

Sheberghān is located along the [[Sari Pul River]] banks, about {{convert|130|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] on the national primary ring road that connects [[Kabul]], [[Puli Khumri]], Mazar-i-Sharif, Sheberghān, [[Maymana]], [[Herat]], [[Kandahar]], [[Ghazni]], and [[Maidan Shar]]. [[Sheberghan airport|Sheberghān airport]] is situated between Sheberghān and [[Aqcha]].

==Etymology==

The city's name is a corruption of its classical [[Persian language|Persian]] name, Shaporgân, meaning "[King] Shapur's town". [[Shapur (name)|Shapur]] was the name of two [[Sasanian]] kings, both of whom built a great number of cities. However, [[Shapur I]] was the governor of the eastern provinces of the empire, and it is more likely that he is the builder of a roadway between a few important cities. These include [[Nishapur]] and [[Bishapur]] in Iran, and [[Peshawar]] in Pakistan.

==Ethnography==

After [[Maymana]], Sheberghan is the second most important [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] and [[Turkmens|Turkmen]]-dominated city in all of Afghanistan. [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] is the [[first language]] of a majority of its inhabitants. Large numbers of [[Tajiks]], [[Hazaras]], [[Pashtuns]], and [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Arabs]] live in the city. In 1856, [[J. P. Ferrier]] wrote: "Sheberghān is a town containing 12,000 souls. [[Uzbeks]] being in the great majority." According to regional consensus of the Afghan government as of 2020 [[Turkmens]] made up majority of the inhabitants.  

The [[History of Arabs in Afghanistan|Sheberghan "Arabs"]] are all [[Persian language|Persian]]-speaking, even though they claim an Arab identity due to religious reasons. There are other such Persian and [[Pashto]]-speaking "Arabs" to the east, with pockets residing in [[Mazar-i Sharif]], [[Kholm, Afghanistan|Kholm]], [[Kunduz]], and [[Jalalabad]]. Their self-identification as Arabs is largely based on their tribal identity, and may in fact point to the Arab migration of the 7th and 8th centuries migration to this and other Central Asian locales in the wake of the [[Muslim conquest of Persia|Islamic conquests of the region]].<ref>Barfield (1982), p. ?</ref>

==History==
[[File:Budynek w parku - Szeberghan - 002500n.jpg|thumb|Sheberghan palace in 1976]]
[[File:Yemshi Tepe Tillya Tepe map.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Circular fortress of [[Yemshi Tepe]] (to scale), and tumuli of [[Tillya Tepe]], near Sheberghan.]]
Sheberghān was once a flourishing settlement along the [[Silk Road]]. In 1978, Soviet archaeologists discovered the famed [[Bactrian Gold]] in the village of [[Tillia Tepe]] outside Sheberghān. In the 13th century Marco Polo visited the city and later wrote about its honey-sweet melons. Sheberghān became the capital of an independent [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] [[khanate]] that was allotted to Afghanistan by the 1873 Anglo-Russian border agreement.

Sheberghān has for millennia been the focal point of power in the northeast corner of [[Bactria]]. It still sits astride the main route between [[Balkh]] and [[Herat]], and controls the direct route north to the [[Amu Darya]], about 90&nbsp;km away, as well as the important branch route south to [[Sar-e Pol, Afghanistan|Sar-e Pol]].
 
In 1856, J. P. Ferrier reported:

{{Quote|The town has a citadel, in which the governor Rustem Khan resides, but there are no other fortifications. It is surrounded by good gardens and excellent cultivation. The population of Shibberghan has a high character for bravery, and I may safely say it is one of the finest towns in Turkistan on this side of the Oxus, enjoying, besides its other advantages, an excellent climate. It is, however, subject to one very serious inconvenience: the supply of water, on which all this prosperity depends, comes from the mountains in the Khanat of Sirpool; and as there are frequent disputes between the tribes inhabiting it and those living in the town, a complete interruption of the supply is often threatened, and a war follows, to the very great injury of the place. Shibberghan maintains permanently a force of 2000 horse and 500-foot, but, in case of necessity, the town can arm 6000 men.<ref>Ferrier (1856), p. 202.</ref>}}

The heavily fortified town of [[Yemshi-tepe]], just five kilometres to the northeast of modern Sheberghān, on the road to [[Akcha]], is only about {{convert|500|m|yd|abbr=off}} from the famous necropolis of [[Tillya Tepe|Tillia Tepe]], where an immense treasure was excavated from the graves of the local royal family by a joint Soviet-Afghan archaeological effort from 1969 to 1979. In 1977, a Soviet-Afghan [[archaeological]] team began excavations 5&nbsp;km north of the town for relics. They uncovered mud-brick columns and a cross-shaped altar of an ancient temple dating back to at least 1000 B.C. Six royal tombs were excavated at [[Tillia Tepe]] revealing a vast amount of gold and other treasures. Several coins dated to the early 1st century C.E., with none dated later.

Sheberghān has been proposed as the site of ancient Xidun, one of the five ''xihou'', or divisions, of the early [[Kushan Empire]].<ref>Hill (2009), pp. 29, 332-341.</ref>

Sheberghān was the stronghold of local Uzbek warlord [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]] while vying with his [[Tājik people|Tajik]] rival General [[Mohammed Atta (Afghan warlord)|Mohammed Atta]] for control of northern Afghanistan in the early years of the [[Karzai administration]].

Sheberghān was the site of the [[Dasht-i-Leili massacre]] in December 2001 during the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan in which 250 to 3,000 (depending on sources) [[Taliban]] prisoners were shot or suffocated to death in metal truck containers, while being transferred by [[United States|American]] and [[Northern Alliance]] soldiers from [[Kunduz]] to a Sheberghān prison. <ref>{{cite web |title=Assessments and Documentation in Afghanistan {{!}} Assessments in Afghanistan: Dasht-e-Leili |url=https://phr.org/issues/investigating-deaths-and-mass-atrocities/assessments-and-documentation-of-mass-crimes/assessments-in-afghanistan/assessments-in-afghanistan-dasht-e-leili-photos/ |website=Physicians for Human Rights |publisher=Physicians for Human Rights}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |title=Opinion - EDITORIAL - The Truth About Dasht-i-Leili |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/14/opinion/14tue2.html |work=New York Times |date=July 13, 2009}}</ref>

On 7 August 2021, Taliban forces captured Sheberghan as part of their [[2021 Taliban offensive|nationwide military offensive]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Sheberghan: Taliban captures second Afghan provincial capital |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/7/taliban-advance-on-second-afghan-provincial-capital-in-24-hours |access-date=7 August 2021 |work=Al Jazeera |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=7 August 2021}}</ref> <ref>{{cite news |title=Sheberghan: Taliban captures second Afghan provincial capita |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2021/8/7/taliban-advance-on-second-afghan-provincial-capital-in-24-hours |agency=Reuters |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=7 August 2021}}</ref>

==Land use==
Sheberghān is a trading and transit hub in northern Afghanistan.<ref name="auto1"/> Agriculture accounts for 50% of the 7,335 hectares within the municipal boundaries.<ref name="auto1"/> 23% of the land is residential, and largely clustered in the central area, but well distributed through the four districts.<ref name="auto1"/>

==Climate==
Sheberghān has a [[semi-arid climate#Cold semi-arid climates|cool, semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSk'')<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{cite web|title=Climate: شبرغان - Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/31381/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|access-date=3 September 2013}}</ref> with hot summers and chilly, though variable, winters. There is moderate rainfall and some snowfall from January to March, but the rest of the year is dry, especially the summer.

==Economy==
Sheberghān is surrounded by irrigated agricultural land.

With Soviet assistance, exploitation of Afghanistan's natural gas reserves began in 1967 at the Khowaja Gogerak field, 15 kilometers east of Sheberghān in [[Jowzjan]] Province. The field's reserves were thought to be 67 billion cubic meters. In 1967, the Soviets also completed a 100-kilometer gas pipeline linking [[Keleft]] in the [[Soviet Union]] with Sheberghān.

To demonstrate how natural gas reserves could be used as an alternative to expensive petroleum imports, the [[United States Department of Defense]] spent $43 million on a natural gas filling station.<ref name=BBC-2015>{{cite web|title=Afghan fuel station cost $43m, US military report says|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-34703279|publisher=BBC News|access-date=3 November 2015}}</ref>

Sheberghān is important to the energy infrastructure of Afghanistan:

* The [[Zomrad Sai Oilfield]] is situated near Sheberghān.
* The [[Sheberghan Topping Plant|Sheberghān Topping Plant]] processes crude oil for consumption in heating boilers in [[Kabul]], [[Mazari Sharif]], and Sheberghān.
* The Jorqaduk, Khowaja Gogerak, and Yatimtaq gas fields are all located within {{convert|20|mi|km}} of Sheberghān.
