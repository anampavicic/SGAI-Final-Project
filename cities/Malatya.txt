'''Malatya''' ({{langx|hy|Մալաթիա|translit=Malat'ia}}; [[Syriac language|Syriac]] ܡܠܝܛܝܢܐ Malīṭīná; {{langx|ku|Meletî}};<ref>Dr Abdulla Ghafor (2000). Kurdistan: Dabeshî Kargêrî Terrîtorî 1927-1997. Stockholm.</ref> [[Ancient Greek]]: Μελιτηνή) is a large city in the [[Eastern Anatolia]] region of [[Turkey]] and the capital of [[Malatya Province]]. The city has been a human settlement for thousands of years. 

In [[Hittite language|Hittite]], ''melid'' or ''milit'' means "honey", offering a possible etymology for the name, which was mentioned in the contemporary sources of the time under several variations (e.g., [[Hittite language|Hittite]]: ''Malidiya''<ref name=":0">"[https://books.google.com/books?id=O1yFrzi-MgYC&pg=PA35 Melid]."

Strabo says that the city was known "to the ancients"<ref name="Strabo, Geographica">Strabo ''Geographica, Translated from the Greek text by W. Falconer (London, 1903); Book XII, Chapter I''</ref> as Melitene ([[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] ''Μελιτηνή''), a name adopted by the Romans following Roman expansion into the east. According to Strabo, the inhabitants of Melitene shared with the nearby [[Cappadocia]]ns and [[Cataonia]]ns the same language and culture.

The site of ancient Melitene lies a few kilometres from the modern city in what is now the village of [[Arslantepe]] and near the district center of [[Battalgazi]] ([[Byzantine]] to [[Ottoman Empire]]). Present-day Battalgazi was the location of the city of Malatya until the 19th century, when a gradual move of the city to the present third location began. Battalgazi's official name was Eskimalatya (''Old Malatya''); until recently, it was a name used locally. In Turkey the city is renowned for its [[apricot]]s, as up to 80% of the Turkish apricot production is provided by Malatya, giving Malatya the name ''kayısı diyarı'' ("apricot realm").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.malatyaguncel.com/news_detail.php?id=22792|title=Malatyalılar İstanbul'da Yürüdü|website=malatyaguncel.com|date=11 July 2009 |publisher=Malatya Güncel Haber|access-date=12 October 2018|language=tr}}</ref>

In February 2023, the city suffered huge damage as a result of the [[2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake|Turkey–Syria earthquake]].<ref name=":0" />

== History ==

=== Arslantepe ===

[[File:MalatyaMuseumSchwerter.jpg|thumb|right|Bronze Age swords from [[Melid|Arslantepe]], c.3000 BCE, in the [[Malatya Museum]]]]

{{main|Melid}}
Arslantepe has been inhabited since the development of agriculture in the [[Fertile Crescent]], nearly 6,000 years ago. From the [[Bronze Age]], the site became an administrative center of a larger region in the kingdom of [[Isuwa]]. The city was heavily fortified. The [[Hittites]] conquered the city in the fourteenth century B.C. In the [[Hittite language]], ''melid'' or ''milit'' means "honey." The name was mentioned in the contemporary sources under several variations (e.g., Hittite: ''Malidiya''<ref>"[https://books.google.com/books?id=O1yFrzi-MgYC&pg=PA35 Melid]." ''Reallexikon der Assyriologie.'' Accessed 12 Dec 2010.</ref> and possibly also ''Midduwa'';<ref>''KBo'' V 8 IV 18. Op. cit. Puhvel, Jaan. ''Trends in Linguistics: [https://books.google.com/books?id=XROpWC99BD0C&pg=PA101 Hittite Etymological Dictionary]:'' Vol. 6: ''Words Beginning with M.'' Walter de Gruyter, 2004. Accessed 12 Dec 2010.</ref> [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]]: Meliddu;<ref name="Hawkins, John D. 2000"/> [[Urartian language|Urar̩tian]]: Meliṭeia<ref name="Hawkins, John D. 2000"/>).

After the end of the Hittite Empire, the city became the center of the [[Neo-Hittite]] state of [[Kammanu]]. The city continued old Hittite traditions and styles. Researchers have discovered a palace inside the city walls with statues and reliefs. A palace was erected with monumental stone sculptures of lions and the ruler. Kammanu was a vassal state of [[Urartu]] between 804 and 743.

According to [[Igor Diakonoff]] and [[John A. C. Greppin|John Greppin]], there was likely an [[Armenians|Armenian]] presence in Melid by 1200 BCE.<ref>John A. C. Greppin and I. M. Diakonoff. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/603403?read-now=1&seq=8 Some Effects of the Hurro-Urartian People and Their Languages upon the Earliest Armenians]'' Journal of the American Oriental Society Vol. 111, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1991), p. 727.</ref>

The [[Neo-Assyria]]n king [[Tiglath-Pileser I]] (1115–1077 B.C.) forced the kingdom of Malidiya to pay tribute to Assyria. The Neo-Assyrian king [[Sargon II]] (722–705) sacked the city in 712 BC. At the same time, the [[Cimmerians]] and [[Scythians]] invaded [[Anatolia]] and the city declined. Some occupation continued on the site into the Hellenistic and Roman periods—a smithy with four ovens has been excavated from the Roman period. There was a long gap in occupation between the mid-7th century and renewed use of the site in the late 12th or early 13th century.<ref>T. A. Sinclair, "Eastern Turkey, an Architectural and Archaeological Survey", volume 3, page 14.</ref>

Archeologists first began to excavate the site of Arslantepe in the 1930s, led by French archaeologist [[Louis Joseph Delaporte|Louis Delaporte]]. Since 1961 an Italian team of archaeologists, led by [[Marcella Frangipane]] in the early 21st century, has been working at the site.

From the 6th century BC, Melid was ruled by the Armenian [[Orontid Dynasty]], who were subjects of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. After periods of Achaemenid and [[Macedonian Empire|Macedonian]] rule, Melid (Malatya) was part of the Kingdom of [[Lesser Armenia]].

=== Melitene during the Roman Empire ===

[[File:Malatya_old_houses_2012.jpg|thumb|Malatya historic houses]]

[[Diodorus Siculus]] wrote that [[Ptolemaeus of Commagene]] attacked and captured Melitene from the [[Kingdom of Cappadocia]], but couldn't keep it for long since [[Ariarathes V of Cappadocia]] marched against him with a strong army, and Ptolemaeus withdrew.<ref>[http://remacle.org/bloodwolf/historiens/diodore/livre31.htm Diodorus Siculus, Library, 31.22.1]</ref>

Sinclair page 3">T. A. Sinclair, "Eastern Turkey, an Architectural and Archaeological Survey", volume 3, page 3.</ref> (which continued to be based there until at least the early 5th century according to [[Notitia Dignitatum]]). The legionary base of Melitene controlled access to southern Armenia and the upper Tigris. It was the end point of the important highway running east from Caesarea (modern [[Kayseri]]). The camp attracted a civilian population and was probably granted city status by Trajan in the early 2nd century AD,<ref name="A. Sinclair page 3"/> with the rank of Municipium.<ref>Cambridge Ancient History 11 – The High Empire, p. 609</ref> It is known for being a prolific source of imperial coins minted from the 3rd to the early 5th centuries.

[[Procopius]] wrote admiringly of the temples, agoras and theatres of Melitene, but no evidence of them now remains. It was a major center in the province of [[Lesser Armenia|Armenia Minor]] ({{langx|hy|Փոքր Հայք}} ''Pokr Hayk'',<ref name=adontz>{{cite book |last=Adontz |first=Nicolas |date=1970 |title=The Reform of Justinian Armenia |url=https://archive.org/details/TheReformOfJustinianInArmenia |location=Lisbon |publisher=Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation |page=311 }}</ref>) created by Diocletian from territory separated from the province of [[Cappadocia (Roman province)|Cappadocia]]. In 392 A.D., emperor [[Theodosius I]] divided Armenia Minor into two new provinces: [[First Armenia]], with its capital at Sebasteia (modern [[Sivas]]); and [[Second Armenia]], with its capital at Melitene.<ref>Robert H. Hewsen ''Armenia: A Historical Atlas'', p74. University of Chicago Press. 2001. {{ISBN|978-0-226-33228-4}}.</ref>

During the reign of the Emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565), administrative reforms were carried out in this region: The province of Second Armenia was renamed [[Roman Armenia|Third Armenia]] (''Armenia Tertia''), with its territory unchanged and its capital still at Melitene.<ref>Robert H.

It then became a base for their raids deeper into the Byzantine Empire, a policy continued by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]]. In the 9th century, under its semi-independent emir [[Umar al-Aqta]], Malatya rose to become a major opponent of the [[Byzantine Empire]] until Umar was defeated and killed at the [[Battle of Lalakaon]] in 863. The Byzantines attacked the city many times, but did not finally take it until the campaigns of [[John Kourkouas]] in 927–934. After successively accepting and renouncing vassal status, the city was finally taken in May 934, its Muslim inhabitants driven out or forced to convert, and replaced by Greek and Armenian settlers.<ref>{{cite book

In the period that followed the [[Turkish people|Turkish]] advance into the Byzantine Empire after the defeat at the [[Battle of Manzikert]], [[Gabriel of Melitene]], a [[Hayhurum|Greek Orthodox]] [[Armenians|Armenian]] who had risen from the ranks of the Byzantine army, governed the city. From 1086 to 1100 he preserved his independence with the aid of the [[Anatolian beyliks|Beylik]] of the [[Danishmends]]. After 1100, he invested heavily on the commanders of the [[First Crusade]], especially [[Bohemond I of Antioch]] and [[Baldwin of Boulogne]].<ref>[[Gabriel of Melitene|Gabriel]] gave his daughter [[Morphia of Melitene]] in marriage to [[Baldwin of Boulogne|Baldwin]] along with a [[dowry]] of 50,000 gold [[bezants]]. He also helped pay the [[ransom]] for [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond]] when he was made captive by [[Danishmend Gazi]]. Even Baldwin's beard weighed heavily on [[Melitene]]. [[William of Tyre]] relates an anecdote in which Baldwin manipulates Gabriel's Oriental sensitivities, especially the reverence for the beard, and manages to extract 30,000 bezants from the ruler by duping him, through a scene arranged with his knights, into believing that he had put his beard in pledge for his soldiery's pay. Gabriel swiftly settled the account and Baldwin and his knights left rejoiced at the success of their stratagem, laughing heartily at the ridiculous veneration of the Orientals for the beard. There are no records of these Armenian assets thus siphoned having been later returned in one form or the other, either by Baldwin or relatives. In September 1101, the Danishmend Turks captured Malatya and in 1113, Baldwin forced [[Morphia of Melitene|Morphia]] to enter in a [[convent]] to marry another woman.

The Danishmends took over Malatya one year later in 1101 (see [[Battle of Melitene]]). With the [[Sultanate of Rum|Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate]] based in [[Konya]] taking over the [[Anatolian beyliks|Beylik]] of Danishmend in the late 12th century, Malatya became part of their realm. Under Danishmend and Seljuk rule, Malatya became a centre of knowledge as many Persian and Arabic scholars took residence in the city. The Seljuk Sultanate also undertook an extensive development of the city.<ref name=islamans>{{cite encyclopedia | url = http://www.islamansiklopedisi.info/ | title = Malatya | encyclopedia = [[İslâm Ansiklopedisi]] | publisher = Türk Diyanet Vakfı | pages= 468–473 | year = 2003 | volume = 27 }}</ref> After being ruled by the [[Ilkhanate|Ilkhanids]] for around 50 years at the end of the 13th century, the Muslim population of the city invited the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Sultanate]] to Malatya in 1315. On 28 April 1315, the Mamluk army entered the city; this was followed by the looting of the city by the army. The [[Eretna Dynasty]] gained sovereignty over the city for some time, but from 1338 onwards the Mamluks secured its control. However, for the latter part of the 14th century, the control of the city fluctuated between the Mamluks and the [[Beylik of Dulkadir|Dulkadirids]].<ref name=islamans/> The city was captured by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] army led by [[Selim I|Yavuz Sultan Selim]] on 28 July 1516 and remained under Ottoman rule until the establishment of the Republic of Turkey. Under the Ottomans, the city lost the quality of being on the frontiers, as well as the allure it held in the Middle Ages. It was plagued between the 16th and 18th centuries by successive rebellions.<ref name=islamans/>

=== Modern period ===

The current city of Malatya was founded in 1838, with the old site of Militene now designated as Old Malatya.<ref>''Britannica''. 15th Edition (1982), Vol. 7, p. 526</ref> The reason behind the displacement of the city center was that the Ottoman army settled and stayed, probably by seizing from its settlers, in the previous city center, in the winter of 1838–39, before taking the road for [[Battle of Nezib]] in 1849. Because of this, citizens of the Malatya established the new city based on a near town called Aspuzu.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Battalgazi|url=http://www.malatya.gov.tr/battalgazi|access-date=2021-01-10|website=www.malatya.gov.tr}}</ref> The city saw rapid expansion in the 19th century, and by the end of the century it had around 5000 households, 50 mosques, six [[madrasa]]s, nine inns and five [[Turkish bath]]s. Ottoman sources also recorded ten churches. In 1889 and 1890, Malatya was struck by two large fires that destroyed thousands of shops. The city was then hit by the [[1893 Malatya earthquake]], which killed 1300, destroying 1200 houses and four mosques. A [[cholera]] outbreak that subsequently took place in 1893 killed 896 people. The destroyed buildings were rebuilt in 1894.<ref name=islamans/>
Malatya was the scene of anti-Armenian violence during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. During the [[Hamidian Massacres]] of 1895–1896, 7,500 Armenian civilians were massacred and Armenian villages in the rural countryside of Malatya were destroyed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kevorkian|first1=Raymond|title=The Armenian Genocide: A Complete history|date=2011|publisher=I.B.Tauris |isbn=978-0857730206|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mZ33AgAAQBAJ}}</ref> In the aftermath, a [[Red Cross]] team sent to Malatya and led by Julian B.

According to the [[Catholic Encyclopedia|1913 ''Catholic Encyclopedia'']], Malatya city was inhabited by 30,000 people with a clear ethnic [[Turkish people|Turkish]] majority, and an Armenian population of 3,000, of whom 800 were [[Catholics]].<ref>{{cite CE1913|wstitle= Melitene |volume= 10 |last= Vailhé |first= Siméon |author-link= |short=1}}</ref> Of the five churches in the city, three belonged to the Armenians. In the spring of 1915, the vast majority of the Armenians of the town were rounded up by Ottoman authorities and deported on death marches as part of the [[Armenian genocide]]. According to reports of the [[governor]] of the Malatya district, of the 6,935 registered Armenians in Malatya, 197 were left in the town as artisans.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Akçam|first1=Taner|title=The Young Turks' Crime Against Humanity: The Armenian Genocide and Ethnic Cleansing in the Ottoman Empire|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691153339|page=248}}</ref> In the early Republican era, Malatya became the centre of [[Malatya Province]] and enjoyed a substantial growth in terms of population as well as covered area.<ref name="IslamAnsiklopedisi">{{cite web | url = http://www.islamansiklopedisi.info/dia/ayrmetin.php?idno=270473 | title = MALATYA | author = Göknur Göğebakan | publisher = [[İslâm Ansiklopedisi]] [Islamic Encyclopedia]| volume = 27 | page = 473 | access-date = 12 October 2018 | language = tr}}</ref> This development was further accelerated by the construction of the Adana-Fevzipaşa-Malatya railroad in 1931, and a few years later in 1937, by the construction of the Sivas-Malatya railroad.<ref name="IslamAnsiklopedisi"/>
