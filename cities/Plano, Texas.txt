'''Plano''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|l|eɪ|n|oʊ}} {{respell|PLAY|noh}}) is a city in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], where it is the largest city in [[Collin County, Texas|Collin County]]. Plano is also one of the principal cities of the [[Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex]]. With a population of 285,494 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=QuickFacts: Plano city, Texas |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/planocitytexas/PST045219|access-date= |website=U.S. Census Bureau}}</ref> it is the [[List of municipalities in Texas|ninth most-populous]] city in Texas, and, respectively, the [[List of United States cities by population|73rd most populous]] city in the United States.

Plano's economy is a large part of [[Economy of Dallas|Dallas' economy]], home to many large companies such as [[Frito-Lay|Frito Lay]], [[JCPenney]], [[Pizza Hut]], and other major distributors. It is also home to the headquarters of [[Toyota Motor North America]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Toyota USA {{!}} Toyota Operations Map {{!}} Design, Engineering & Marketing |url=https://www.toyota.com/usa/operations/map/tcal |access-date=2024-09-19 |website=www.toyota.com |language=en}}</ref> Plano has also been named as both one of the fastest growing cities and one of the best places to live in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Staff |first=FOX 4 |date=2024-03-27 |title=Where North Texas ranked on list of 'Best Cities to Live in America' |url=https://www.fox4news.com/news/plano-best-cities-to-live-in-america-2024 |access-date=2024-07-23 |website=FOX 4 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Plano, Texas}}
[[File:Old map-Plano-1891.jpg|thumb|Plano, Texas in 1891. Toned [[Lithography|lithograph]] by A.E. Downs, [[Boston]]. Published by T. M. Fowler & James B. Moyer. [[Amon Carter Museum]], [[Fort Worth, Texas]]]]

Settlers came to the area near present-day Plano in the early 1840s.<ref name="Timeline" /> Facilities such as a [[sawmill]], a [[gristmill]], and a store soon brought more people to the area. A mail service was established, and after rejecting several names for the nascent town (including naming it in honor of then-President [[Millard Fillmore]]),<ref name="Schell" /> residents suggested the name ''Plano'' (from the Spanish word for "flat") in reference to the local terrain, unvaried and devoid of any trees. The post office accepted the name.<ref name="Schell" />

In 1872, the completion of the [[List of Texas railroads|Houston and Central Texas Railway]] helped Plano grow, and it was incorporated in 1873.<ref name="Schell" /> By 1874, the population was over 500.<ref name="Timeline" /> In 1881, a fire raged through the business district, destroying most of the buildings.<ref name="Timeline" /><ref name="Schell" /> Plano was rebuilt and business again flourished through the 1880s. Also in 1881, the city assumed responsibility for what would eventually become [[Plano Independent School District]] (PISD), ending the days of it being served only by private schools.<ref name="Timeline" />

At first, Plano's population grew slowly, reaching 1,304 in 1900 and 3,695 in 1960.<ref name="Timeline" /> By 1970, Plano began to feel some of the boom its neighbors had experienced after World War II. A series of [[public works]] projects and a change in taxes that removed the farming community from the town helped increase the population. In 1970, the population reached 17,872,<ref name="Timeline" /> and by 1980, it had exploded to 72,000.<ref name="Timeline" /> Sewers, schools, and street development kept pace with this massive increase, largely because of Plano's flat topography, grid layout, and planning initiatives.

During the 1980s, many large corporations, including [[J. C. Penney]] and [[Frito-Lay]], moved their headquarters to Plano, spurring further growth. By 1990, the population reached 128,713,<ref name="Timeline" /> dwarfing the [[county seat]], [[McKinney, Texas|McKinney]]. In 1994, Plano was recognized as an [[All-America City Award|All-America City]].<ref name="AllAmerica" /> By 2000, the population grew to 222,030,<ref name="Timeline" /> making it one of Dallas's largest suburbs. Plano is surrounded by other municipalities and so cannot expand in area, and there is little undeveloped land within the city limits. But as of July 2012, one large tract of land was being developed: Turnpike Commons<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theretailconnection.net/uploaded/property/20080813114241164.pdf |title=Turnpike Commons |website=Theretailconnection.net |date=August 13, 2008 |access-date=January 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130807111920/http://www.theretailconnection.net/uploaded/property/20080813114241164.pdf |archive-date=August 7, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> at the intersection of Renner Road and the George Bush Turnpike (also bordered by Shiloh Road to the east). The development is expected to feature apartments, medical facilities, restaurants, a Race Trac gas station, and a hotel.

On June 15, 2015, after five years of disuse, a 178-foot water tower built in 1985 was demolished to make room for [[Legacy West]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/plano-water-tower-scheduled-for-demoltion/120163/ |title=Crews Demolish 30-Year-Old Plano Water Tower |website=Nbcdfw.com|date=June 15, 2015 }}</ref>

All council members, including the mayor, serve a maximum of two consecutive four-year terms.<ref name="CityCouncil" /> The mayor and city council members could serve for a maximum of three consecutive three-year terms until voters approved changes to the city charter in 2011.<ref name="Terms" />

===Politics===
Dallas's wealthy northern suburbs were solidly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], and in 2005, the Bay Area Center for Voting Research ranked Plano, the largest of them, the United States' fifth-most conservative city.<ref>[http://americancityandcounty.com/content/study-ranks-americas-most-liberal-and-conservative-cities Bay Area Center for Voting Research] Retrieved January 7, 2014.</ref> It has recently become more competitive in national elections as its population has diversified, shifting toward the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] since 2016, when [[Donald Trump]] won the city by a narrow margin. In [[2018 United States Senate election in Texas|2018]], [[Beto O'Rourke]] became the first Democrat to win the city in a statewide election in the 21st century, and in [[2020 United States presidential election in Texas|2020]], [[Joe Biden]] won the city by an even larger margin. But in local and state elections, Plano still leans Republican, voting to reelect Governor [[Greg Abbott]] in [[2018 Texas gubernatorial election|2018]] and narrowly reelecting Republicans to the [[Texas House of Representatives]] and [[Texas Senate]] in [[2018 Texas Senate election|2018]] and [[2020 Texas House of Representatives election|2020]].

Plano has given $1.2 billion in property tax revenue to other school districts through Texas's "[[Robin Hood plan|Robin Hood]]" law, which requires school districts designated as affluent to give a percentage of their property tax revenue to other districts outside the county.<ref name="PISD2008" /> In 2008, PISD gave $86 million. Controversy erupted when the salaries of teachers in less affluent districts—such as [[Garland ISD]]—exceeded the salaries of teachers in districts that had to pay into "Robin Hood".<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/news/education/headlines/20100328-Plano-ISD-mutes-criticism-of-1631.ece Plano ISD mutes criticism of 'Robin Hood' as its annual funding hit declines | The Dallas Morning News].

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
[[File:Downtown Plano Station October 2015 7.jpg|thumb|A DART Red Line train at the [[Downtown Plano (DART station)|Downtown Plano]] station]]
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Plano DART Transit Service.JPG|thumb|The tracks and adjacent platforms at the [[Parker Road (DART station)|Parker Road]] DART station]] -->
Plano is one of 12 suburbs of Dallas that opt into the [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) public transportation system. During its early membership in DART, Plano was lightly served by bus lines, but in 2002, the [[Red Line (DART)|Red Line]] of the [[DART light rail]] project opened stations in [[Downtown Plano station|Downtown Plano]] and at [[Parker Road station|Parker Road]], which provide access to commuters traveling to work elsewhere in the Dallas area. The [[Orange Line (DART)|Orange Line]] traverses the same route for selected weekday/peak hour trips. Bus routes serve areas of downtown, south central, and west Plano, but no bus routes serve the far north, north central, and far east areas. Instead, DART's GoLink on-demand service serves these areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dartorgcmsblob.dart.org/prod/docs/default-source/dart-maps/dartsystemmap.pdf |title=DART System Map |website=[[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] |access-date=6 February 2024 |date=22 January 2024}}</ref> The [[Silver Line (DART)|Silver Line]] is also planned to run through Southern Plano. Approximately 1% of the city's population uses DART. The Parker Road station charged for parking for non-member city residents from April 2, 2012, to April 3, 2014, as a part of the Fair Share Parking initiative. Two DART park-and-ride bus facilities, separate from the rail lines, are in Plano: [[Jack Hatchell Transit Center]] and [[Northwest Plano Park & Ride]].

Plano was the first city in Collin County to adopt a master plan for its road system. The use of multi-lane, divided highways for all major roads allows for higher speed limits, generally {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, but sometimes up to {{convert|55|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} on the northern section of [[Texas State Highway 289|Preston Road]]. Plano is served directly by several major roadways and freeways. Central Plano is bordered to the east by [[U.S. Route 75 in Texas|U.S. Highway 75]], the west by [[Dallas North Tollway]], the south by [[President George Bush Turnpike]] ([[Texas State Highway 190]] (east of Coit Road)), and the north by [[Sam Rayburn Tollway]] ([[Texas State Highway 121]]). Preston Road ([[Texas State Highway 289]]) is a major thoroughfare that runs through the city. Plano is Texas's largest city without an [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highway]].

Plano opened a new interchange at Parker Rd. and U.S. 75 in December 2010. The [[single point urban interchange|single-point interchange]] is the first of its kind in Texas. The design is intended to reduce severe congestion at this interchange. According to [https://web.archive.org/web/20120220225248/http://tti.tamu.edu/conferences/tsc11/program/presentations/traffic-ops-2/young.pdf reports], traffic congestion has been reduced by 50-75%.

Plano is roughly 30 miles northeast of [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]], the primary airport serving Plano residents and visitors.
