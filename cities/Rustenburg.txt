Rustenburg was one of the official host cities of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], being in close proximity to [[Phokeng]], the capital of the [[Royal Bafokeng Nation]], where the [[Royal Bafokeng Stadium]] is located. The [[England national football team]] also used this as their base camp for the tournament.

==History==
===Mfecane===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}
Before European settlers arrived, the area had been settled by agrarian [[Setswana]]-speaking tribes.

Rustenburg's population is primarily [[Tswana people]].  Partially belonging to the [[Royal Bafokeng Nation]], extensive landowners earning royalties from mining operations. The Royal Bafokeng are descendants of [[Sotho people|Sotho]] [[settler]]s who displaced the local tribes from the region, which they came to call 'place of dew' (Phokeng). In the early 1800s, the Bafokeng and other Tswana communities were conquered in a series of devastating wars launched by an offshoot of the Zulu kingdom, called the Matebele.  The Boers had also fought the Zulu and Matebele, and so the Boers and Tswana found in the Matebele a common enemy.  The Tswana and Boers planned together and worked toward defeating the Matebele from a Sotho-Tswana kingdom to the south, and together, they defeated the Matebele.  As the Boers settled in the area, called their settlement Rustenburg because they had relatively friendly relations with their Bafokeng allies in the area, and after the many violent military conflicts with other African chiefdoms, such as the Matebele, they believed they could rest ("rusten" in Dutch) in this settlement, whose name literally means "Resting Town."{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}  Although had already long lived in the area when the Boers arrived, the Bafokeng bought land rights from the Boers, and they purchased their first tracts of land in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century from the colonial rulers, some in exchange for serving in the [[Boer Wars]]. Although these land purchases were technically illegal,{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} Paul Kruger, who would become a president of the Transvaal Boer Republic, but was then a veld kornet, was friendly to the Bafokeng and helped arrange many of these purchases. A public hospital has been named after Paul Kruger.

===Establishment===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2018}}

Rustenburg was established in 1851 as an administrative centre for an Afrikaner farming area that produced [[citrus]] fruit, tobacco, peanuts, [[sunflower seed]]s, maize, wheat and cattle.  On 10 February 1859, the [[Reformed Churches in South Africa]] was founded under a [[Melia azedarach|Syringa tree]], now commemorated with a memorial. Rustenburg was the home of [[Paul Kruger]], president of the [[South African Republic]], who bought a 5 square kilometer farm to the north-west of the town in 1863. The homestead on his farm, [[Boekenhoutfontein]], is now the Paul Kruger Country Museum. When the Boer and the British came to blows in the [[Second Boer War]] (1899), the territory around Rustenburg became a battlefield. The two sides clashed at nearby [[Mafikeng]], where the British garrison found itself under siege for months.

Among the early residents of Rustenburg were settlers of Indian origin. One of the first families of Indian origin was the Bhyat family, whose contribution to the city's history was marked by the renaming of a major street name to ''Fatima Bhayat Street'' in honour of [[Fatima Bhyat]] who arrived in Rustenburg with her husband in 1877.

[[Platinum]] mining in Rustenburg began in 1929, shortly after the discovery of the Platinum Reef by [[Hans Merensky]], later named the [[Merensky Reef]]. The mine is located about 3&nbsp;km from the town centre and owned and managed by the [[Anglo American plc]]. According to legend, the farmer that owned the land sold the mineral rights to Anglo American for R10 000.

===Post-Apartheid===
The township of Boitekong on the northeast side of Rustenburg has one of the highest incidences of [[HIV/AIDS in South Africa|AIDS]] orphans in South Africa<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/72-000-new-infections-in-6-months-20101201 |title=72 000 new infections in 6 months |publisher=News24 |date=1 December 2010 |access-date=7 May 2012}}</ref> Rustenburg was the venue for World AIDS Day commemoration in December 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&sid=14998&tid=25252 |title=M Masike: World AIDS Day (English) |publisher=Info.gov.za |access-date=7 May 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328122236/http://www.info.gov.za/speech/DynamicAction?pageid=461&sid=14998&tid=25252 |archive-date=28 March 2012 }}</ref> The township is in a geographical area which bears the brunt of the catchment area of the toxic effects of the mining industry coupled with a very poor quality of water supply from the local [[Bospoort Dam]], the water from which was for decades considered too toxic for human consumption until water shortages in the nineties compelled the purification and supply to Boitekong. Life for the majority under the rule of the 'Royal Bafokeng' has parallels to the apartheid era.  In the Apartheid era, forced removals of old settlements were on the basis of racial divide whereas now it is done for installation of massive mining operations sometimes engulfing entire villages.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The Royal Bafokeng company own the stadium selected as a World Cup 2010 venue, the only 'private' stadium that hosted games in the 2010 World cup. The Royal Bafokeng regard themselves as a 'separate nation' which is in contradiction to the [[Rainbow nation]] espoused by Desmond Tutu and [[Nelson Mandela]]. This 'nationhood' is regarded by many today{{who|date=October 2018}} as a [[divide and rule]] tactic orchestrated by the mining conglomerates which has subsequently led to the calls for [[nationalization]] of the mining industry by the [[ANC Youth League]]. The majority of people in the region 20 years after the fall of apartheid still live in abject poverty despite the massive profits yielded by the platinum royalties. This has led in recent years to claims of kleptocracy against the 'royal' family and [[land claim]] disputes.{{Original research inline|date=October 2018}}

Agriculture in the region has been in constant decline since the decimation of the vast citrus estates of Rustenburg in the 1970s and 1980s due to pollution from increased smelting and beneficiating processes by mines. There are only a fraction of the original citrus farms remaining.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1990, the first post-Apartheid conference between the [[Nederduits Gereformeerde Kerk]] (the Dutch Reformed Church in Africa) and the South African churches was held in Rustenburg. During this conference, professor Willie Jonker of the University of Stellenbosch made this confession on behalf of the entire DRC:
<blockquote>"[I] confess before you and before the Lord, not only my own sin and guilt,
and my personal responsibility for the political, social, economic and structural wrongs that have been done to many of you and the results [from] which you and our whole country are still suffering, but vicariously I dare also to do that in the name of the NGK [the white DRC], of which I am a member, and for the Afrikaans people as a whole."<ref>{{Cite book

==Climate==
Rustenburg has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa''), with a relatively high degree of [[diurnal temperature variation]] due to the high elevation. It has very warm summers (from December to February) and mild winters (from June to August). Due to the altitude, summers are not quite as hot as one might expect. Precipitation occurs mainly in summer. There is occasional frost at night in winter.

Rustenburg has been highly dependent on [[mining]] which is responsible for more than 65% of local [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] and 50% of all direct jobs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Economic Dependence on a Single Industry |url=https://e.huawei.com/topic/leading-new-ict-en/rustenburg-smartcity-case.html#:~:text=Rustenburg%20is%20highly%20dependent%20on,population%20engaged%20in%20the%20industry. |website=e.huawei.com |publisher=e.huawei.com}}</ref> The secondary [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] contributors are, by a considerable margin, finance (9%) and retail (8%).<ref>{{cite web |title=The Impact of Platinum Mining in Rustenburg - A High-level Analysis |url=https://eunomix.com/cmsAdmin/uploads/eunomix-research_-the-impact-of-platinum-mining-in-rustenburg_march2016_001.pdf |website=eunomix.com/ |publisher=Eunomix Research}}</ref> Since [[platinum-group metals|Platinum]] mining is projected to decline after 2040, the [[Rustenburg Local Municipality]] formulated the Rustenburg Vision 2040 in 2014, with the goal of becoming a world-class green, efficient, sustainable and intricately interconnected [[Smart City]] where all communities enjoy a high quality of life. This includes the redevelopment and rejuvenation of existing CBD areas to new world-class commercial centres with a conspicuous signature skyline incorporating a plethora of [[High-rise building|high-rise]] landmark buildings and [[skyscraper]]s as part of the smart space planning and smart maximization of land usage that sustainably creates breathing room for people to move, live, work and play.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rustenburg Master Plan |url=http://www.rustenburg.gov.za/Docs/Part3_Draft_RLM_Land_Use_and_Zoning_Plan.pdf |website=rustenburg.gov.za |publisher=Rustenburg Local Municipality}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rustenburg Smart City Case - World Platinum Capital Deploys Smart City 'Gold Mine' of Intelligence |url=https://e.huawei.com/topic/leading-new-ict-en/rustenburg-smartcity-case.html |website=e.huawei.com/ |publisher=Huawei |access-date=25 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rustenburg - Smart City: World Platinum Capital Deploys Smart City 'Gold Mine' of Intelligence |url=https://www.cio.com/article/3365078/rustenburg-world-platinum-capital-deploys-smart-city-gold-mine.html |website=cio.com |date=14 March 2019 |publisher=IDG Communications, Inc.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Live smart: Invest in this smart city of the future |url=https://www.century21.co.za/news/live-smart-invest-in-this-smart-city-of-the-future/ |website=century21.co.za |publisher=century21.co.za}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rustenburg Master Plan Official Page|url=https://www.rustenburg.gov.za/rustenburg-vision-2040/ |website=rustenburg.gov.za |publisher=Rustenburg Local Municipality}}</ref>

===Rustenburg Rapid Transport Project (RRT)===

As at the end of the 2017/18 financial year, the [[Rustenburg Local Municipality|Rustenburg Metropolitan]] had spent about R2.7 billion on the upgrading of old and the construction of new public transport infrastructure in and around the city. The infrastructure includes {{cvt|20|km}} of bi-directional [[Transitway]] Rustenburg Rapid Transport (RRT) [[Bus rapid transit]] lanes, walk ways and 17 Sub-stations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rustenburg Rapid Transport (RRT) |url=https://www.rustenburg.gov.za/update-on-the-rustenburg-rapid-transport-rrt-as-part-of-transport-month/ |website=rustenburg.gov.za |publisher=Rustenburg Local Municipality |access-date=25 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Rustenburg Rapid Transport project, South Africa |url=https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/print-version/rustenburg-rapid-transport-project-south-africa-2014-10-17 |website=engineeringnews.co.za |publisher=engineeringnews.co.za |access-date=25 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=RUSTENBURG RAPID TRANSPORT SYSTEM |url=https://www.concretetrends.co.za/news/rustenburg-rapid-transport-system-nears-completion/ |website=concretetrends.co.za |publisher=concretetrends.co.za/ |access-date=25 July 2016}}</ref> After completion, 37 safe and clean enclosed stations on the trunk lines stations will be fully operational along {{cvt|40|km}} of road using at least 100 articulated buses to transport passengers along the main corridors. On completion of Phase 1 of the 4 phase project, the RRT is projected to deliver 225 000 passenger trips a day through 13 routes, 240 bus stops and 15 BRT stations using around 268 buses.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rustenburg Rapid Transport project, South Africa: Project Description |url=https://www.engineeringnews.co.za/ |website=engineeringnews.co.za |publisher=engineeringnews.co.za/ |access-date=25 June 2020}}</ref> While [[Bus rapid transit]] is one of the components of the RRT system design, it will not be an exclusively BRT driven operation. The routes have been planned to integrate with bus routes servicing townships, suburbs and outlying village areas as well as long-distance bus services, which will work in unison to move people around the city and region.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ya Rona Bus Service Launch |url=https://www.rustenburg.gov.za/events/ya-rona-launch/ |website=rustenburg.gov.za |publisher=rustenburg.gov.za |access-date=11 November 2019}}</ref>
