Beginning as early as AD&nbsp;166–168, the [[Quadi]] and [[Marcomanni]] destroyed the main Roman town in the area, present-day [[Oderzo]]. This part of [[Roman Italy]] was again overrun in the early 5th century by the [[Visigoths]] and, some 50&nbsp;years later, by the Huns led by [[Attila]]. The last and most enduring immigration into the north of the Italian peninsula, that of the [[Lombards]] in 568, left the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] only a small strip of coastline in the current Veneto, including Venice. The Roman/Byzantine territory was organized as the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], administered from that ancient port and overseen by a viceroy (the [[Exarch]]) appointed by the Emperor in [[Constantinople]]. Ravenna and Venice were connected by just sea routes, and with the Venetians' isolation came increasing autonomy. New ports were built, including those at [[Malamocco]] and [[Torcello]] in the Venetian lagoon. The ''tribuni maiores'' formed the earliest central standing governing committee of the islands in the lagoon, dating from {{Circa|568}}.<ref group="note">Traditional date as given in William J. Langer, ed. ''An Encyclopedia of World History''.</ref>

The traditional first [[doge of Venice]], [[Paolo Lucio Anafesto]] (Anafestus Paulicius), was elected in 697, as written in the [[Chronicon Venetum et Gradense|oldest chronicle]] by [[John, deacon of Venice]] {{Circa|1008}}. Some modern historians claim Paolo Lucio Anafesto was actually the [[Paul (exarch)|Exarch Paul]], and Paul's successor, [[Marcello Tegalliano]], was Paul's ''[[magister militum]]'' (or "general"), literally "master of soldiers". In 726 the soldiers and citizens of the exarchate rose in a rebellion over the [[iconoclastic controversy]], at the urging of [[Pope Gregory II]]. The exarch, held responsible for the acts of his master, Byzantine Emperor [[Leo III the Isaurian|Leo III]], was murdered, and many officials were put to flight in the chaos. At about this time, the people of the lagoon elected their own independent leader for the first time, although the relationship of this to the uprisings is not clear. [[Orso Ipato|Ursus]] was the first of 117 "doges" (''doge'' is the [[Venetian language|Venetian dialectal]] equivalent of the Latin ''[[dux]]'' ("leader"); the corresponding word in English is [[duke]], in standard Italian ''duca'' (see also "[[duce]]".) Whatever his original views, Ursus supported Emperor Leo III's successful military expedition to recover Ravenna, sending both men and ships. In recognition of this, Venice was "granted numerous privileges and concessions" and Ursus, who had personally taken the field, was confirmed by Leo as ''dux''<ref>{{Cite book |last=Norwich |first=John Julius |author-link=John Julius Norwich |date=1982 |title=A History of Venice |title-link=A History of Venice |location=New York |publisher=[[Alfred A. Knopf]] |page=13}}</ref> and given the added title of ''[[hypatus]]'' (from the Greek for "[[consul]]").<ref>Alethea Wiel (1995)[1898]. ''A History of Venice'', pp.&nbsp;26–27.

In 751, the [[Lombards|Lombard]] King [[Aistulf]] conquered most of the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]], leaving Venice a lonely and increasingly autonomous Byzantine outpost. During this period, the seat of the local Byzantine governor (the "duke/dux", later "doge"), was at Malamocco. Settlement on the islands in the lagoon probably increased with the Lombard conquest of other Byzantine territories, as refugees sought asylum in the area. In 775/6, the [[bishop|episcopal]] seat of Olivolo ([[San Pietro di Castello]]) was created. During the reign of duke [[Agnello Particiaco]] (811–827) the ducal seat moved from Malamocco to the more protected Rialto, within present-day Venice. The monastery of [[Pope Zachary|St Zachary]] and the first [[Doge's Palace, Venice|ducal palace]] and [[basilica of St. Mark]], as well as a walled defense (''civitatis murus'') between Olivolo and Rialto, were subsequently built here.

[[Charlemagne]] sought to subdue the city to his rule. He ordered the pope to expel the Venetians from the [[Pentapolis]] along the Adriatic coast;<ref>Langer</ref> Charlemagne's own son [[Pepin of Italy]], king of the Lombards, under the authority of his father, embarked on a siege of Venice itself. This, however, proved a costly failure. The siege lasted six months, with Pepin's army ravaged by the diseases of the local swamps and eventually forced to withdraw in 810. A few months later, Pepin himself died, apparently as a result of a disease contracted there. In the aftermath, an agreement between Charlemagne and the Byzantine Emperor [[Nikephoros I Logothetes|Nicephorus]] in 814 recognized Venice as Byzantine territory, and granted the city trading rights along the Adriatic coast.

In 828 the new city's prestige increased with the acquisition, from [[Alexandria]], of relics claimed to be of [[St Mark the Evangelist]]; these were placed in the new basilica. Winged lions – visible throughout Venice – are the [[Symbols of the Evangelists|emblem of St Mark]]. The patriarchal seat was also moved to Rialto. As the community continued to develop, and as Byzantine power waned, its own autonomy grew, leading to eventual independence.<ref>{{cite book |title=Venice: A New History |first=Thomas F. |last=Madden |date=2012 |page= |publisher=Penguin Publishing Group |isbn=9781101601136}}</ref>

=== Expansion ===
[[File:Republic of Venice – Blank map of the main territories.png|thumb|The [[Republic of Venice]] with its [[Domini di Terraferma|Terraferma]] and [[Stato da Màr]]]]

From the 9th to the 12th centuries, Venice developed into a powerful maritime empire (an Italian [[thalassocracy]] known also as ''[[Maritime republics|repubblica marinara]]''). In addition to Venice there were seven others: the most important ones were [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]], and [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]]; and the lesser known were [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]], [[Republic of Ancona|Ancona]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]] and [[Republic of Noli|Noli]]. Its own strategic position at the head of the Adriatic made Venetian naval and commercial power almost invulnerable.<ref>{{Cite book |title=The Dot On the I In History: Of Gentiles and Jews—a Hebrew Odyssey Scrolling the Internet |last=Hammer |first=Michael B. |publisher=Lulu Publishing Services |year=2017 |isbn=978-1483427010 |ol=30680683M |location=Morrisville |page=239}}</ref> With the elimination of pirates along the [[Dalmatia|Dalmatian coast]], the city became a flourishing trade centre between Western Europe and the rest of the world, especially with the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Asia]], where its navy protected sea routes against piracy.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Piracy as an Islamic-Christian Interface in the Thirteenth Century |journal=Viator |volume=11 |page=165 |doi=10.1484/J.VIATOR.2.301504 |year=1980 |last1=Burns |first1=Robert I|issn = 0083-5897 }}</ref>

The [[Republic of Venice]] seized a number of places on the eastern shores of the Adriatic before 1200, mostly for commercial reasons, because [[pirate]]s based there were a menace to trade. The doge already possessed the titles of Duke of Dalmatia and Duke of [[Istria]]. Later mainland possessions, which extended across [[Lake Garda]] as far west as the [[Adda River]], were known as the ''Terraferma''; they were acquired partly as a buffer against belligerent neighbours, partly to guarantee [[Alps|Alpine]] trade routes, and partly to ensure the supply of mainland wheat (on which the city depended). In building its maritime commercial empire, Venice dominated the trade in salt,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~gel115/salt.html |title=The importance of salt |last=Cowen |first=Richard |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507083302/http://mygeologypage.ucdavis.edu/cowen/~GEL115/salt.html |archive-date=7 May 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> acquired control of most of the islands in the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], including [[Crete]], and [[Cyprus]] in the Mediterranean, and became a major power-broker in the [[Near East]]. By the standards of the time, Venice's stewardship of its mainland territories was relatively enlightened and the citizens of such towns as [[Bergamo]], [[Brescia]], and [[Verona, Italy|Verona]] rallied to the defence of Venetian sovereignty when it was threatened by invaders.

[[File:Bartolomeo Colleoni by Andrea del Verrocchio.jpg|thumb|Monument to [[Bartolomeo Colleoni]] (1400–1475), captain-general of the [[Republic of Venice]] from 1455 to 1475]]
Venice remained closely associated with Constantinople, being twice granted trading privileges in the Eastern Roman Empire, through the so-called [[golden bull]]s or "chrysobulls", in return for aiding the Eastern Empire to resist Norman and Turkish incursions. In the first chrysobull, Venice acknowledged its homage to the empire; but not in the second, reflecting the decline of [[Byzantium]] and the rise of Venice's power.<ref>{{cite book |title=Byzantium: The Surprising Life of a Medieval Empire |first=Judith |last=Herrin |date=2008 |page= |publisher=Penguin Adult |isbn=9780141031026}}</ref>

Venice became an imperial power following the [[Fourth Crusade]], which, having veered off course, culminated in 1204 by capturing and sacking [[Constantinople]] and establishing the [[Latin Empire]]. As a result of this conquest, considerable Byzantine plunder was brought back to Venice. This plunder included the [[Horses of Saint Mark|gilt bronze horses]] from the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]], which were originally placed above the entrance to the cathedral of Venice, [[St Mark's Basilica]] (The originals have been replaced with replicas, and are now stored within the basilica.) After the fall of Constantinople, the former Eastern Roman Empire was partitioned among the Latin crusaders and the Venetians. Venice subsequently carved out a sphere of influence in the Mediterranean known as the [[Duchy of the Archipelago]], and captured Crete.<ref>{{cite book |title=Enrico Dandolo and the Rise of Venice |first=Thomas F. |last=Madden |date=2006 |page= |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |isbn=9780801885396}}</ref>

The seizure of Constantinople proved as decisive a factor in ending the Byzantine Empire as the loss of the [[Anatolia]]n [[Theme (Byzantine administrative unit)|themes]], after [[Battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]]. Although the Byzantines recovered control of the ravaged city a half-century later, the Byzantine Empire was terminally weakened, and existed as a ghost of its old self, until [[Sultan Mehmet The Conqueror]] took the city [[Fall of Constantinople|in 1453]].

[[File:San Giorgio Maggiore - Venice, Italy - panoramio.jpg|thumb|View of [[San Giorgio Maggiore]] from [[St. Mark's Campanile]]]]
Situated on the [[Adriatic Sea]], Venice had always traded extensively with the Byzantine Empire and the [[Middle East]]. By the late 13th century, Venice was the most prosperous city in all of Europe. At the peak of its power and wealth, it had 36,000 sailors operating 3,300 ships, dominating Mediterranean commerce. Venice's leading families vied with each other to build the grandest palaces and to support the work of the greatest and most talented artists. The city was governed by the [[Great Council of Venice|Great Council]], which was made up of members of the noble families of Venice. The Great Council appointed all public officials, and elected a Senate of 200 to 300 individuals. Since this group was too large for efficient administration, a [[Council of Ten]] (also called the Ducal Council, or the Signoria), controlled much of the administration of the city. One member of the great council was elected "[[doges of Venice|doge]]", or duke, to be the chief executive; he would usually hold the title until his death, although several Doges were forced, by pressure from their [[oligarchy|oligarchical]] peers, to resign and retire into [[monastery|monastic]] seclusion, when they were felt to have been discredited by political failure.

The Venetian governmental structure was similar in some ways to the republican system of ancient Rome, with an elected chief executive (the doge), a senator-like assembly of nobles, and the general citizenry with limited political power, who originally had the power to grant or withhold their approval of each newly elected doge. Church and various private property was tied to military service, although there was no knight tenure within the city itself. The ''Cavalieri di San Marco'' was the only order of [[chivalry]] ever instituted in Venice, and no citizen could accept or join a foreign order without the government's consent. Venice remained a republic throughout its independent period, and politics and the military were kept separate, except when on occasion the Doge personally headed the military. War was regarded as a continuation of [[commerce]] by other means. Therefore, the city's early employment of large numbers of mercenaries for service elsewhere, and later its reliance on foreign mercenaries when the ruling class was preoccupied with commerce.

Although the people of Venice generally remained orthodox Roman Catholics, the state of Venice was notable for its freedom from religious fanaticism, and executed nobody for religious heresy during the [[Counter-Reformation]]. This apparent lack of zeal contributed to Venice's frequent conflicts with the [[papacy]]. In this context, the writings of the Anglican divine [[William Bedell]] are particularly illuminating. Venice was threatened with the [[Interdict (Catholic canon law)|interdict]] on a number of occasions and twice suffered its imposition. The second, most noted, occasion was in 1606, by order of [[Pope Paul V]].<ref>{{cite CE1913 |wstitle=Pope Paul V |volume=11 |last=Loughlin |first=James Francis |short=1}}</ref>

The newly invented German [[printing press]] spread rapidly throughout Europe in the 15th century, and Venice was quick to adopt it. By 1482, Venice was the printing capital of the world; the leading printer was [[Aldus Manutius]], who invented paperback books that could be carried in a saddlebag.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nadeau |first=Barbie Latza |title=The Man Who Changed Reading Forever |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/aldus-manutius-printing-typeface-typography-italics-venice-180956855/ |date=6 November 2015 |access-date=28 February 2022 |website=Smithsonian Magazine |language=en}}</ref> His ''Aldine Editions'' included translations of nearly all the known Greek manuscripts of the era.<ref>James Burke, ''Connections'' (Little, Brown and Co., 1978/1995), {{ISBN|978-0-316-11672-5}}, p.105</ref>

=== Decline ===
Venice's long decline started in the 15th century. Venice confronted the [[Ottoman Empire]] in the [[Siege of Thessalonica (1422–1430)]] and sent ships to help defend [[Constantinople]] against the besieging Turks in 1453. After the [[Fall of Constantinople]], [[Sultan Mehmed II]] declared the first of a series of [[Ottoman-Venetian wars]] that cost Venice much of its eastern Mediterranean possessions. [[Vasco da Gama]]'s 1497–1499 voyage opened a sea route to [[India]] around the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and destroyed Venice's monopoly. Venice's [[oared vessels]] were at a disadvantage when it came to traversing oceans, therefore Venice was left behind in the race for [[colonies]].<ref name="www.studenti.it">{{Cite web |title=Repubblica di Venezia: storia, cronologia e caratteristiche della Serenissima |trans-title=Republic of Venice: history, chronology and characteristics of the Serenissima |url=https://www.studenti.it/repubblica-venezia-storia-cronologia-caratteristiche-della-serenissima.html |last=Angione |first=Edoardo |date=15 July 2019 |access-date=7 July 2023 |work=Studenti |language=it}}</ref>

Venice began to lose the position as a centre of [[international trade]] during the later part of the [[Renaissance]] as Portugal became Europe's principal intermediary in the trade with the East, striking at the very foundation of Venice's great wealth. France and Spain fought for [[hegemony]] over Italy in the [[Italian Wars]], marginalising its political influence. However, Venice remained a major exporter of agricultural products and until the mid-18th century, a significant manufacturing centre.<ref name="www.studenti.it" />

The Republic of Venice lost its independence when [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] conquered Venice on 12 May 1797 during the [[War of the First Coalition]]. Napoleon was seen as something of a liberator by the city's Jewish population. He removed the gates of the [[Venetian Ghetto|Ghetto]] and ended the restrictions on when and where Jews could live and travel in the city.

Venice became Austrian territory when Napoleon signed the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] on 12 October 1797. The Austrians took control of the city on 18 January 1798. Venice was taken from Austria by the [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]] in 1805 and became part of [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleon's Kingdom of Italy]]. It was returned to Austria following Napoleon's defeat in 1814, when it became part of the Austrian-held [[Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia]]. In 1848 a revolt briefly re-established the [[Repubblica di San Marco|Venetian republic]] under [[Daniele Manin]], but this was crushed in 1849. In 1866, after the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], Venice, along with the rest of the Veneto, became part of the newly created [[Kingdom of Italy]].

From the middle of the 18th century, [[Trieste]] and papal [[Ancona]], both of which became free ports, competed with Venice more and more economically. Habsburg Trieste in particular boomed and increasingly served trade via the [[Suez Canal]], which opened in 1869, between Asia and Central Europe, while Venice very quickly lost its competitive edge and commercial strength.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kretschmayr |first=Heinrich |author-link=Heinrich Kretschmayr |title=Geschichte von Venedig |volume=3 |date=2017 |page=450}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], the historic city was largely free from attack, the only aggressive effort of note being [[Operation Bowler]], a successful [[Royal Air Force]] precision strike on the German naval operations in the city in March 1945.

Venice was listed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 1987, inscribing it as "Venice and its Lagoon".

== Geography ==
[[File:Space Station Flight Over Venice.jpg|thumb|right|Venice viewed from the [[International Space Station]]]]

Venice is located in northeastern Italy, in the Veneto region. The city is situated on a group of 118 small islands that are separated by canals and linked by 438 bridges. The historic center of Venice is divided into six districts, or sestieri, which are named [[Cannaregio]], Castello, [[Dorsoduro]], San Marco, San Polo, and Santa Croce.

Venice sits atop alluvial silt washed into the sea by the rivers flowing eastward from the Alps across the [[Veneto]] plain, with the silt being stretched into long banks, or ''lidi'', by the action of the current flowing around the head of the [[Adriatic Sea]] from east to west.<ref>{{EB1911 |noprescript=1 |wstitle=Venice |volume=27 |page=995}}</ref>

=== Subsidence ===
[[Subsidence]], the gradual lowering of the surface of Venice, has contributed – along with other factors – to the seasonal ''[[Acqua alta]]'' ("high water") when the city's lowest lying surfaces may be covered at high tide.

Between autumn and early spring, the city is often threatened by flood [[tide]]s pushing in from the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. Six hundred years ago, Venetians protected themselves from land-based attacks by diverting all the major rivers flowing into the lagoon and thus preventing sediment from filling the area around the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/venice/sieg_nf.html |title=NOVA {{pipe}} Sinking City of Venice {{pipe}} Venice Under Siege (non-Flash) {{pipe}} PBS |website=PBS}}</ref> This created an ever-deeper lagoon environment. Additionally, the lowest part of Venice, [[St Mark's Basilica]], is only {{convert|64|cm|in}} above sea level, and one of the most flood-prone parts of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Brown |first=Hannah |date=9 August 2021 |title=Venice floods: Watch tourists wade through knee-deep water |url=https://www.euronews.com/travel/2021/08/09/venice-is-flooding-again-watch-tourists-wade-through-knee-deep-water |access-date=15 November 2021 |website=[[euronews]] |language=en}}</ref>

In 1604, to defray the cost of flood relief, Venice introduced what could be considered the first example of a stamp tax.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Iwu |first1=Rita |title=Stamp Tax |url=https://www.ibtimes.com/terms/s/stamp-tax |website=[[International Business Times]] |access-date=26 October 2022 |language=en |date=19 May 2021}}</ref> When the revenue fell short of expectations in 1608, Venice introduced [[Postal stationery|paper]], with the superscription "AQ" and imprinted instructions, which was to be used for "letters to officials". At first, this was to be a temporary tax, but it remained in effect until the fall of the Republic in 1797. Shortly after the introduction of the tax, Spain produced similar paper for general taxation purposes, and the practice spread to other countries.

During the 20th century, when many [[artesian well]]s were sunk into the periphery of the lagoon to draw water for local industry, Venice began to [[subsidence|subside]]. It was realized that extraction of water from the [[aquifer]] was the cause. The sinking has slowed markedly since artesian wells were banned in the 1960s. However, the city is still threatened by more frequent low-level floods – the ''[[Acqua alta]]'', that rise to a height of several centimetres over its [[quay]]s – regularly following certain tides.

<blockquote>
Mose is a pharaonic project that should have cost €800m [£675m] but will cost at least €7bn [£6bn]. If the barriers are closed at only 90 cm of high water, most of St Mark's will be flooded anyway; but if closed at very high levels only, then people will wonder at the logic of spending such sums on something that didn't solve the problem. And pressure will come from the cruise ships to keep the gates open.

=== Climate ===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Venice has a mid-latitude, four season [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), with cool, damp winters and warm, humid summers. The 24-hour average temperature in January is {{convert|3.3|C|F|1}}, and for July this figure is {{convert|23.0|C|F|1}}. Precipitation is spread relatively evenly throughout the year, and averages {{convert|748|mm|in}}; snow isn't a rarity between late November and early March. During the most severe winters, the canals and parts of the lagoon can freeze, but with the warming trend of the past 30–40 years, the occurrence has become rarer.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sibilla |first=Marco |title=Laguna ghiacciata |trans-title=Frozen lagoon |url=http://www.meteovenezia.net/laguna-ghiacciata.html |website=Meteo Venezia |language=it |access-date=2 March 2020}}</ref>

Since 1991, the Church of [[San Giorgio dei Greci]] in Venice has become the [[Episcopal see|see]] of the [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy and Malta|Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Italy and Malta and Exarchate of Southern Europe]], a [[Byzantine Rite|Byzantine-rite]] diocese under the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esarcato.it/concelebrazione-dei-vescovi-ortodossi-ditalia-a-venezia/?lang=en |title=Italian Orthodox Bishops concelebrating in Venice. |access-date=24 April 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215174526/http://www.ortodossia.it/Home.it.htm |archive-date=15 December 2008}}</ref>

There is also a historic [[History of the Jews in Venice|Jewish community]] in Venice. The [[Venetian Ghetto]] was the area in which Jews were compelled to live under the Venetian Republic. The word ''ghetto'' (''ghèto''), originally [[Venetian language|Venetian]], is now found in many languages. [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'', written in the late 16th century, features [[Shylock]], a Venetian Jew. The first complete and uncensored printed edition of the [[Talmud]] was printed in Venice by [[Daniel Bomberg]] in 1523. During [[World War II]], Jews were rounded up in Venice and deported to [[extermination camp]]s.

The legislative body of the Comune is the City Council (''Consiglio Comunale''), which is composed of 36 councillors elected every five years with a proportional system, contextually to the mayoral elections. The executive body is the City Administration (''Giunta Comunale''), composed of 12 [[Assessor (Italy)|assessors]] nominated and presided over by a directly elected [[Mayor of Venice|Mayor]].

Venice was governed by [[Centre-left coalition (Italy)|centre-left]] parties from the early 1990s until the 2010s, when the Mayor started to be elected directly. Its region, [[Veneto]], has long been a conservative stronghold, with the coalition between the regionalist [[Lega Nord]] and the [[Centre-right coalition (Italy)|centre-right]] [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] winning absolute majorities of the electorate in many elections at local, national, and regional levels.

The current mayor of Venice is [[Luigi Brugnaro]], a centre-right independent businessman who is currently serving his second term in office.

The municipality of Venice is also subdivided into six administrative boroughs (''municipalità''). Each borough is governed by a council (''Consiglio'') and a president, elected every five years. The urban organization is dictated by Article 114 of the [[Constitution of Italy|Italian Constitution]]. The boroughs have the power to advise the Mayor with nonbinding opinions on a large spectrum of topics (environment, construction, public health, local markets) and exercise the functions delegated to them by the City Council; in addition, they are supplied with autonomous funding to finance local activities.

=== ''Sestieri'' ===
The historic city of Venice has historically been divided into six ''[[sestiere|sestieri]]'', and is made up of a total of 127 individual islands, most of which are separated from their neighbors by narrow channels only.<ref>[https://web.wpi.edu/Pubs/E-project/Available/E-project-121715-123903/unrestricted/VE15-Isles_Report.pdf Georges Gauthier, David McDonald, Jenna O’Connell, Nick Panzarino: Exploring the City of Islands: Interactive Resources for Analyzing the Islands of Venice.

Each ''sestiere'' is now a statistical and historical area without any degree of autonomy.<ref name="imagesofvenice.com">{{Cite web |last=Coulling |first=Ian |date=2 November 2020 |title=Districts & Attractions – Introduction |url=https://imagesofvenice.com/districts-and-attractions-introduction/ |access-date=7 July 2023 |website=Images of Venice |language=en-US}}</ref>

The six fingers or phalanges of the ''ferro'' on the bow of a [[gondola]] represent the six ''sestieri''.<ref name="imagesofvenice.com" />

The ''sestieri'' are divided into [[parish]]es—initially 70 in 1033, but reduced under [[Napoleon]], and now numbering just 38. These parishes predate the ''sestieri'', which were created in about 1170. Each parish exhibited unique characteristics but also belonged to an integrated network. Each community chose its own patron saint, staged its own festivals, congregated around its own market centre, constructed its own bell towers, and developed its own customs.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Venice: History Of The Floating City |last=Ferraro |first=Joanne |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2012 |location=New York}}</ref>

Each ''sestiere'' has its own [[house numbering]] system. Each house has a unique number in the district, from one to several thousand, generally numbered from one corner of the area to another, but not usually in a readily understandable manner.<ref name="www.scoprivenezia.com" />

[[Economic history of Venice|Venice's economy]] has changed throughout history. Although there is little specific information about the earliest years, it is likely that an important source of the city's prosperity was the trade in slaves, captured in central Europe and sold to North Africa and the [[Levant]]. Venice's location at the head of the Adriatic, and directly south of the terminus of the [[Brenner Pass]] over the Alps, would have given it a distinct advantage as a middleman in this important trade. In the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]], Venice was a major centre for commerce and trade, as it controlled a vast sea-empire, and became an extremely wealthy European city and a leader in political and economic affairs.<ref name="aboutvenice.org">{{cite web |url=http://www.aboutvenice.org/economy-of-venice.html |title=The economy of Venice, Italy |work=Aboutvenice.org |access-date=22 April 2010 |archive-date=27 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627151212/http://www.aboutvenice.org/economy-of-venice.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> From the 11th century until the 15th century, [[pilgrimage]]s to the [[Holy Land]] were offered in Venice. Other ports such as [[Genoa]], [[Pisa]], [[Marseille]], [[Ancona]], and [[Dubrovnik]] were hardly able to compete with the well organized transportation of pilgrims from Venice.<ref>Pilgerreisen von Venedig nach Jerusalem im späten Mittelalter- Die Verträge mit dem Schiffspatron, Seite 2, Fabian H.

[[Armenia]]n merchants from [[New Julfa|Julfa]] were the leading traders in Venice, especially the [[Sceriman family]] in the 17th century. They were specialized in the gems and diamonds business.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Foundation |first=Encyclopaedia Iranica |title=Welcome to Encyclopaedia Iranica |url=https://iranicaonline.org/ |access-date=13 May 2021 |website=iranicaonline.org |language=en-US}}</ref> The trade volume reached millions of tons, which was exceptional for 17th century.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bakhchinyan |first=Artsvi |date=2017 |title=The Activity of Armenian Merchants in International Trade |url=https://src-h.slav.hokudai.ac.jp/rp/publications/no14/14-03_Bakhchinyan.pdf |page=25}}</ref> This all changed by the 17th century, when Venice's trade empire was taken over by countries such as Portugal, and its importance as a naval power was reduced. In the 18th century, it became a major agricultural and industrial exporter. The 18th century's biggest industrial complex was the [[Venice Arsenal]], and the Italian Army still uses it today (even though some space has been used for major theatrical and cultural productions, and as spaces for art).<ref name="britannica.com">{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/625298/Venice/24381/Economy |title=Venice (Italy) :: Economy – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |access-date=22 April 2010}}</ref> Since World War II, many Venetians have moved to the neighboring cities of [[Mestre]] and [[Porto Marghera]], seeking employment as well as affordable housing.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Venice |publisher=Funk & Wagnalls New World Encyclopedia |year=2016 |page=1}}</ref>

Today, Venice's economy is mainly based on tourism, shipbuilding (mainly in Mestre and Porto Marghera), services, trade, and industrial exports.<ref name="aboutvenice.org" /> [[Murano glass]] production in [[Murano]] and lace production in [[Burano]] are also highly important to the economy.<ref name="aboutvenice.org" />

The city is facing financial challenges. In late 2016, it had a major deficit in its budget and debts in excess of €400&nbsp;million. "In effect, the place is bankrupt", according to a report by ''[[The Guardian]]''.<ref name="GuardianBuckley201611" /> Many locals are leaving the historic centre due to rapidly increasing rents. The declining native population affects the character of the city, as an October 2016 ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' article pointed out in its subtitle: "Residents are abandoning the city, which is in danger of becoming an overpriced theme park".<ref name="NatgeoWorrall201610" /> The city is also facing other challenges, including erosion, pollution, subsidence, an excessive number of tourists in peak periods, and problems caused by oversized cruise ships sailing close to the banks of the historical city.<ref name="NatgeoWorrall201610" />

In June 2017, Italy was required to bail out two Venetian banks – the [[Banca Popolare di Vicenza]] and [[Veneto Banca]] – to prevent their bankruptcies.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-40400210 |title=Italy forced to bail out two more banks |first=Chris |last=Johnston |work=BBC News |date=25 June 2017}}</ref> Both banks would be wound down and their assets that have value taken over by another Italian bank, [[Intesa Sanpaolo]], which would receive €5.2&nbsp;billion as compensation. The Italian government would be responsible for losses from any uncollectible loans from the closed banks. The cost would be €5.2&nbsp;billion, with further guarantees to cover bad loans totaling €12&nbsp;billion.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2017/jun/26/italy-bank-eu-rescue-veneto-banca-banca-popolare-di-vicenza |title=Italy's €17bn bank job: self-preservation at a long-term EU price? – Nils Pratley |first=Nils |last=Pratley |newspaper=The Guardian |date=26 June 2017 |via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref>

Tourism has been a major part of the Venetian economy since the 18th century, when Venice – with its beautiful cityscape, uniqueness, and rich musical and artistic cultural heritage – was a stop on the [[Grand Tour]]. In the 19th century, Venice became a fashionable centre for the "rich and famous", who often stayed and dined at luxury establishments such as the Danieli Hotel and the [[Caffè Florian]], and continued to be a fashionable city into the early 20th century.<ref name="britannica.com" /> In the 1980s, the [[Carnival of Venice]] was revived; and the city has become a major centre of international conferences and festivals, such as the prestigious [[Venice Biennale]] and the [[Venice Film Festival]], which attract visitors from all over the world for their theatrical, cultural, cinematic, artistic, and musical productions.<ref name="britannica.com" />

Today, there are numerous attractions in Venice, such as [[St Mark's Basilica]], the [[Doge's Palace]], the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]], and the [[Piazza San Marco]]. The [[Lido di Venezia]] is also a popular international luxury destination, attracting thousands of actors, critics, celebrities, and others in the cinematic industry. The city also relies heavily on the cruise business.<ref name="britannica.com" /> The Cruise Venice Committee has estimated that cruise ship passengers spend more than 150&nbsp;million euros (US$193&nbsp;million) annually in the city, according to a 2015 report.<ref>{{cite web |last=Mack |first=Benjamin |date=9 November 2012 |title=Tourism overwhelms vanishing Venice |url=http://www.dw.de/tourism-overwhelms-vanishing-venice/a-16364608 |website=DW.de |access-date=13 January 2015}}</ref> Other reports, however, point out that such day-trippers spend relatively little in the few hours of their visits to the city.<ref name="GuardianBuckley201611" />

Venice is regarded by some as a tourist trap, and by others as a "living museum".<ref name="britannica.com" />

==== Diverting cruise ships ====

The need to protect the city's historic environment and fragile canals, in the face of a possible loss of jobs produced by cruise tourism, has seen the Italian Transport Ministry attempt to introduce a ban on large cruise ships visiting the city. A 2013 ban would have allowed only cruise ships smaller than 40,000-gross tons to enter the [[Giudecca Canal]] and St Mark's basin.<ref>{{cite web |title=Italy to ban large cruise ships in Venice |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11023451/Italy-to-ban-large-cruise-ships-in-Venice.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/11023451/Italy-to-ban-large-cruise-ships-in-Venice.html |archive-date=10 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |website=The Daily Telegraph |date=9 August 2014 |access-date=13 January 2015}}{{cbignore}}</ref> In January 2015, a regional court scrapped the ban, but some global cruise lines indicated that they would continue to respect it until a long-term solution for the protection of Venice is found.<ref>{{cite web |title=CLIA says cruise lines will continue to respect Venice cruise ship ban despite new ruling |url=http://www.cruisearabiaonline.com/News/2015/01/13/CLIA-says-cruise-lines-will-continue-to-respect-Venice-cruise-ship-ban-despite-new-ruling |website=Cruise Arabia & Africa |date=13 January 2015 |access-date=13 January 2015}}</ref>

P&O Cruises removed Venice from its summer schedule; Holland America moved one of its ships from this area to Alaska; and Cunard reduced (in 2017 and further in 2018) the number of visits by its ships. As a result, the Venice Port Authority estimated an 11.4 per cent drop in cruise ships arriving in 2017 versus 2016, leading to a similar reduction in income for Venice.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/cruise-ships-and-venice-what-does-it-all-mean-for-the-city/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/cruises/articles/cruise-ships-and-venice-what-does-it-all-mean-for-the-city/ |archive-date=10 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Venice authorities lament lack of cruise ships as residents and Unesco fight for the city's future |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=June 2017 |last1=Archer |first1=Jane}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Having failed in its 2013 bid to ban oversized cruise ships from the Giudecca Canal, the Italian inter-ministerial ''Comitatone'' overseeing Venice's lagoon released an official directive in November 2017 to keep the largest cruise ships away from the Piazza San Marco and the entrance to the Grand Canal.<ref>{{cite web |title='Grandi navi a Marghera': L'atto di indirizzo del Comitatone |trans-title='Large ships to Marghera': The directive from the Comitatone |url=http://www.mit.gov.it/comunicazione/news/grandi-navi-marghera-latto-di-indirizzo-del-comitatone |date=7 November 2017 |website=Italian Ministry of Infrastructure and Transport |language=it |access-date=30 March 2019 |archive-date=30 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190330060547/http://www.mit.gov.it/comunicazione/news/grandi-navi-marghera-latto-di-indirizzo-del-comitatone |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=9 November 2017 |url=https://news.sky.com/story/giant-cruise-ships-banned-from-historic-centre-of-venice-11119153 |title=Giant cruise ships banned from historic centre of Venice |website=[[Sky News]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Outcome of the long-awaited Government decision on the future for cruiseships (Comitatone 7.11.2017) |url=https://weareherevenice.org/outcome-long-awaited-government-decision-future-cruiseships-comitatone-7-11-2017/ |website=We Are Here Venice |access-date=30 March 2019}}</ref> Ships over 55,000 tons will be required to follow a specific route through the Vittorio Emmanuele III Canal to reach [[Marghera]], an industrial area of the mainland, where a passenger terminal would be built.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cruise ship crashes into tourist boat in Venice, injuring five people |url=https://www.anglenews.com/2019/06/03/cruise-ship-crashes-into-tourist-boat-in-venice-injuring-five-people-world-news/ |date=2 June 2019 |website=Angle News |access-date=3 June 2019 |archive-date=3 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603142509/https://www.anglenews.com/2019/06/03/cruise-ship-crashes-into-tourist-boat-in-venice-injuring-five-people-world-news/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2014, the United Nations warned the city that it may be placed on UNESCO's [[List of World Heritage in Danger]] sites unless cruise ships are banned from the canals near the historic centre.<ref>{{cite web |title=UNESCO Pressures Italy to Ban Cruise Ships from Venice |url=https://news.artnet.com/art-world/unesco-pressures-italy-to-ban-cruise-ships-from-venice-133878 |website=Artnet News |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210305215242/https://news.artnet.com/art-world/unesco-pressures-italy-to-ban-cruise-ships-from-venice-133878 |archive-date=5 March 2021 |date=16 October 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

According to the officials, the plan to create an alternative route for ships would require extensive dredging of the canal and the building of a new port, which would take four years, in total, to complete. However, the activist group ''No Grandi Navi'' (No big Ships), argued that the effects of pollution caused by the ships would not be diminished by the re-routing plan.<ref>{{cite news |first=Angela |last=Giuffrida |title=Venice to divert giant cruise ships away from historic centre |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/nov/08/venice-cruise-ship-traffic-restricted-amid-concerns-over-damage-to-buildings |date=8 November 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=6 June 2019}}</ref><ref name="GuardianGiuffrida201906">{{cite news |last=Giuffrida |first=Angela |display-authors=etal |title=Cruise ship crashes into tourist boat in Venice, injuring five people |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jun/02/cruise-ship-crashes-into-tourist-boat-in-venice-injuring-five-people |date=2 June 2019 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=4 June 2019}}</ref>

Some locals continued to aggressively lobby for new methods that would reduce the number of cruise ship passengers; their estimate indicated that there are up to 30,000 such sightseers per day at peak periods,<ref name="GuardianUsborne201609" /> while others concentrate their effort on promoting a more responsible way of visiting the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2017/08/04/ethical-travel-in-venice-tips%22 |title=Top tips for sustainable travel in Venice from local experts |first=AnneMarie |last=McCarthy |website=www.lonelyplanet.com |access-date=26 November 2017 |archive-date=24 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181124022650/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/news/2017/08/04/ethical-travel-in-venice-tips%22/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> An unofficial referendum to ban large cruise ships was held in June 2017.

On 2 June 2019, the cruise ship ''[[MSC Opera]]'' rammed a tourist riverboat, the ''[[Uniworld|River Countess]]'', which was docked on the Giudecca Canal, injuring five people, in addition to causing property damage. The incident immediately led to renewed demands to ban large cruise ships from the Giudecca Canal,<ref>{{cite news |title=Venice crash reignites calls for cruise ship ban |work=BBC News |date=2 June 2019 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-48489158 |access-date=2 June 2019}}</ref> including a [[Twitter]] message to that effect posted by the environment minister.

Nonetheless, the Italian government released an announcement on 7 August 2019 that it would begin rerouting cruise ships larger than 1000 tonnes away from the historic city's Giudecca Canal. For the last four months of 2019, all heavy vessels will dock at the Fusina and Lombardia terminals which are still on the lagoon but away from the central islands. By 2020, one-third of all cruise ships will be rerouted, according to Danilo Toninelli, the minister for Venice. Preparation work for the Vittorio Emanuele Canal needed to begin soon for a long-term solution, according to the Cruise Lines International Association.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Sharpe |first=Olivia |date=8 August 2019 |title=Large cruise ships to be banned from Venice grand canal |url=https://www.cruisetradenews.com/large-cruise-ships-banned-venice-grand-canal/ |magazine=[[Cruise Lines International Association|Cruise Trade News]] |access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Kumar |first=Kalyan |title=Cruise Ships Banned From Venice Grand Canal, City Center After Boat Crashed Into Dock |url=https://www.ibtimes.com/cruise-ships-banned-venice-grand-canal-city-center-after-boat-crashed-dock-2811794 |date=9 August 2019 |website=[[International Business Times]] |access-date=24 April 2020}}</ref> In the long-term, space for ships would be provided at new terminals, perhaps at Chioggia or Lido San Nicolo.

Having failed in its 2013 bid to ban oversized cruise ships from the Giudecca Canal, the city switched to a new strategy in mid-2017, banning the creation of any additional hotels. Currently, there are over 24,000 hotel rooms. The ban does not affect short-term rentals in the historic centre which are causing an increase in the cost of living for the native residents of Venice.<ref name="GuardianBuckley201611" /> The city had already banned any additional fast food "take-away" outlets, to retain the historic character of the city, which was another reason for freezing the number of hotel rooms.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://money.cnn.com/2017/05/10/news/venice-italy-takeout-fast-food-tourism/index.html |title=Venice bans cheap takeout joints to keep city beautiful |last1=Petroff |first1=Alanna |last2=Di Donato |first2=Valentina |date=10 May 2017 |website=[[CNN Money]]}}</ref> Fewer than half of the millions of annual visitors stay overnight, however.<ref name="TelegraphHaines201706" /><ref name="IndependentBuckley201706" />

On 28 February 2019, the Venice City Council voted in favour of a new municipal regulation requiring day-trippers visiting the historic centre, and the islands in the lagoon, to pay a new access fee. The extra revenue from the fee would be used for cleaning, maintaining security, reducing the financial burden on residents of Venice, and to "allow Venetians to live with more decorum". The new tax would be between €3 and €10 per person, depending on the expected tourist flow into the old city.

In the 19th century, a causeway to the mainland brought the railroad to [[Venezia Santa Lucia railway station|Venice]]. The adjoining [[Ponte della Libertà]] road causeway and terminal parking facilities in Tronchetto island and Piazzale Roma were built during the 20th century. Beyond these rail and road terminals on the northern edge of the city, transportation within the city's historic centre remains, as it was in centuries past, entirely on water or on foot. Venice is Europe's largest urban [[Auto-free zones|car-free area]] and is unique in Europe in having remained a sizable functioning city in the 21st century entirely without motorcars or trucks.

The classic Venetian boat is the ''[[gondola]]'', (plural: ''gondole'') although it is now mostly used for tourists, or for weddings, funerals, or other ceremonies, or as ''traghetti''{{clarify|date=May 2024}} (sing.: traghetto) to cross the Grand Canal in lieu of a nearby bridge. The traghetti are operated by two oarsmen.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/veneto/venice/articles/venice-attractions/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/italy/veneto/venice/articles/venice-attractions/ |archive-date=10 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Venice attractions |first=Anne |last=Hanley |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=10 November 2015 |via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

There are approximately 400 licensed gondoliers in Venice, in their distinctive [[livery]], and a similar number of boats, down from 10,000 two centuries ago.{{when|date=May 2024}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2016/aug/11/the-right-stripes-how-fashion-fell-for-the-gondolier |title=The right stripes: how fashion fell for the gondolier |first=Morwenna |last=Ferrier |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 August 2016 |via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref><ref name="ricksteves.com">{{cite web |url=https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/the-gondolas-of-venice |title=The Gondolas of Venice – Rick Steves' Europe |website=www.ricksteves.com}}</ref> Many gondolas are lushly appointed with [[crushed velvet]] seats and [[Persian rug]]s. At the front of each gondola that works in the city, there is a large piece of metal called the ''fèro'' (iron). Its shape has evolved through the centuries, as documented in many well-known paintings. Its form, topped by a likeness of the Doge's hat, became gradually standardized, and was then fixed by local law. It consists of six bars pointing forward representing the [[#Sestieri|sestieri]] of the city, and one that points backwards representing the [[Giudecca]].<ref name="ricksteves.com" /><ref>{{cite web |title=Visit Venice through Gondola's symbolism |url=http://www.hotelsantelena.com/blog/visit-venice-through-gondolas-symbolism/ |date=16 May 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170609022508/http://www.hotelsantelena.com/blog/visit-venice-through-gondolas-symbolism/ |archive-date=9 June 2017 |website=Hotel Sant'Elena |access-date=9 February 2022}}</ref> A lesser-known boat is the smaller, simpler, but similar, [[sandolo]].

==== Waterways ====
Venice's small islands were enhanced during the Middle Ages by the [[dredging]] of soil to raise the marshy ground above the tides. The resulting canals encouraged the flourishing of a nautical culture which proved central to the economy of the city. Today those canals still provide the means for transport of goods and people within the city.

The maze of canals threading through the city requires more than 400 bridges to permit the flow of foot traffic. In 2011, the city opened the [[Ponte della Costituzione]], the fourth bridge across the Grand Canal, which connects the [[Piazzale Roma]] bus-terminal area with the Venezia Santa Lucia railway station. The other bridges are the original [[Ponte di Rialto]], the [[Ponte dell'Accademia]], and the [[Ponte degli Scalzi]].

=== Public transport ===
[[Azienda del Consorzio Trasporti Veneziano]] (ACTV) is a public company responsible for public transportation in Venice.

==== Lagoon area ====
[[File:Vaporetti Venice Lagoon.jpg|thumb|Vaporetti on the Grand Canal]]

The main means of public transportation consists of motorised [[waterbus]]es (''[[vaporetto|vaporetti]]'') which ply regular routes along the Grand Canal and between the city's islands. Private motorised water taxis are also active. The only gondole still in common use by Venetians are the ''traghetti'', foot passenger [[ferry|ferries]] crossing the Grand Canal at certain points where there are no convenient bridges. Other gondole are rented by tourists on an hourly basis.<ref name="ricksteves.com" />

The [[Venice People Mover]] is an elevated shuttle train [[public transit]] system connecting [[Tronchetto island]] with its car parking facility with Piazzale Roma where visitors arrive in the city by bus, taxi, or automobile. The train makes a stop at the Marittima cruise terminal at the [[Port of Venice]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Imboden |first=Durant |title=Venice People Mover |url=https://europeforvisitors.com/venice/articles/venice-people-mover.htm |website=Europe for Visitors |access-date=9 February 2022}}</ref>

==== Lido and Pellestrina islands ====
[[Lido di Venezia|Lido]] and [[Pellestrina]] are two islands forming a barrier between the southern Venetian Lagoon and the Adriatic Sea. On those islands, road traffic, including bus service, is allowed. Vaporetti link them with other islands (Venice, [[Murano]], [[Burano]]) and with the peninsula of [[Cavallino-Treporti]].

==== Mainland ====
[[File:Actv tram Venezia leaving Piazzale Roma 2017.jpg|thumb|[[Trams in Mestre|Tram in Venice]] leaving [[Piazzale Roma]]]]

The mainland of Venice is composed of 4 boroughs: [[Mestre]]-Carpenedo, [[Marghera]], Chirignago-Zelarino, and Favaro Veneto. Mestre is the centre and the most populous urban area of the mainland. There are several bus routes and two [[Translohr]] [[Trams in Mestre|tramway lines]]. Several bus routes and one of the tramway lines link the mainland with ''[[Piazzale Roma]]'', the main bus station in Venice, via [[Ponte della Libertà]], the road bridge connecting the mainland with the group of islands that comprise the historic centre of Venice.

The average amount of time people spend commuting with public transit in Venice, for example to and from work, on a weekday is 52 min. Only 12.2% of public transit riders ride for more than 2 hours every day. The average amount of time people wait at a stop or station for public transit is 10 min, while 17.6% of riders wait for over 20 minutes on average every day. The average distance people usually ride in a single trip with public transit is {{convert|7|km}}, while 12% travel for over {{convert|12|km}} in a single direction.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.moovitapp.com/insights/en/Moovit_Insights_Public_Transit_Index_Italy_Venezia-2083 |title=Venezia Public Transportation Statistics |publisher=Global Public Transit Index by Moovit |access-date=19 June 2017}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50x50px]] Material was copied from this source, which is available under a [[creativecommons:by/4.0/|Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License]].</ref>

=== Rail ===
[[File:Venezia Santa Lucia Train Station R02.jpg|thumb|The [[Venezia Santa Lucia railway station|Venice Santa Lucia station]]]]

Venice is served by regional and national trains, including trains to Florence (1h53), Milan (2h13), Turin (3h10), Rome (3h33), and Naples (4h50). In addition there are international day trains to Zurich, Innsbruck, Munich, and Vienna, plus overnight sleeper services, to Paris and Dijon on [[Thello]] trains, and to Munich and Vienna via [[ÖBB|Austrian Federal Railways]].
* The [[Venezia Santa Lucia railway station]] is a few steps away from a vaporetti stop, Ferovia, in the historic city next to the ''Piazzale Roma''. This station is the terminus of local trains and of the luxury [[Venice Simplon Orient Express]] from London via Paris and other cities.
* The [[Venezia Mestre railway station]] is on the mainland, on the border between the boroughs of Mestre and Marghera.

Both stations are managed by [[Grandi Stazioni]]; they are linked by the ''Ponte della Libertà'' (Liberty Bridge) between the mainland and the city centre.

Other stations in the municipality are Venezia Porto Marghera, Venezia Carpenedo, Venezia Mestre Ospedale, and Venezia Mestre Porta Ovest.

The [[Port of Venice]] ({{langx|it|Porto di Venezia}}) is the eighth-busiest commercial port in Italy and was a major hub for the cruise sector in the [[Mediterranean]], as since August 2021 ships of more 25,000 tons are forbidden to pass the [[Giudecca Canal]]. It is one of the major Italian ports and is included in the list of the leading European ports which are located on the strategic nodes of trans-European networks. In 2002, the port handled 262,337 containers. In 2006, 30,936,931 tonnes passed through the port, of which 14,541,961 was commercial traffic, and saw 1,453,513 passengers.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fletcher |first1=C.

== Sport ==
The most famous Venetian sport is probably ''{{ill|Voga alla Veneta|it|Voga veneta}}'' ("Venetian-style rowing"), also commonly called ''voga veneta''. A technique invented in the Venetian Lagoon, Venetian rowing is unusual in that the rower(s), one or more, row standing, looking forward. Today, ''Voga alla Veneta'' is not only the way the gondoliers row tourists around Venice but also the way Venetians row for pleasure and sport. Many races called ''regata(e)'' happen throughout the year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://veneziaautentica.com/all-that-you-need-to-know-about-the-venetian-rowing-regattas-in-venice/ |title=All that you need to know about the Venetian rowing regattas in Venice |date=31 October 2016 |website=Venezia Autentica}}</ref> The culminating event of the rowing season is the day of the "Regata Storica", which occurs on the first Sunday of September each year.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Alvarez |first1=Joe |last2=Orlova |first2=Tamara A |url=http://www.ikonlondonmagazine.com/regata-storica-is-the-spectacle-to-see/ |title=Regata Storica is The Spectacle to See |publisher=Ikon London Magazine |date=10 September 2016 |access-date=23 February 2018}}</ref>

The main football club in the city is [[Venezia F.C.]], founded in 1907, which currently plays in the [[Serie A]]. Their ground, the [[Stadio Pier Luigi Penzo]], situated in [[Sant'Elena (island)|Sant'Elena]], is the second-oldest continually used stadium in Italy.

The local basketball club is [[Reyer Venezia]], founded in 1872 as the gymnastics club ''Società Sportiva Costantino Reyer'', and in 1907 as the basketball club. Reyer currently plays in the [[Lega Basket Serie A]]. The men's team were the Italian champions in 1942, 1943, and 2017. Their arena is the [[Palasport Giuseppe Taliercio]], situated in [[Mestre]]. [[Luigi Brugnaro]] is both the president of the club and the mayor of the city.

== Education ==
[[File:(Venice) Ca' Foscari.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]]]]

Venice is a major international centre for higher education. The city hosts the [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice]], founded in 1868; the {{Lang|it|[[Università Iuav di Venezia]]|italic=no}}, founded in 1926; the [[Venice International University]], founded in 1995 and located on the island of [[San Servolo]] and the [[European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation|EIUC-European Inter-University Centre for Human Rights and Democratisation]], located on the island of [[Lido di Venezia]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Global Campus of Human Rights – Education & Research |url=https://gchumanrights.org/ |access-date=7 July 2023 |website=GlobalCampus of Human Rights – GCHumanRights |language=en}}</ref>

== Culture ==

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Venetian literature}}

[[File:Marco Polo, Il Milione, Chapter CXXIII and CXXIV.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'']]

Venice has long been a source of inspiration for authors, playwrights, and poets, and at the forefront of the technological development of printing and publishing.

Two of the most noted Venetian writers were [[Marco Polo]] in the Middle Ages and, later, [[Giacomo Casanova]]. Polo (1254–1324) was a merchant who voyaged to [[the Orient]]. His series of books, co-written with [[Rustichello da Pisa]] and titled ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo|Il Milione]]'' provided important knowledge of the lands east of Europe, from the Middle East to China, Japan, and Russia. [[Giacomo Casanova]] (1725–1798) was a prolific writer and adventurer best remembered for his autobiography, ''Histoire De Ma Vie'' (''Story of My Life''), which links his colourful lifestyle to the city of Venice.

Venetian playwrights followed the old Italian theatre tradition of ''[[commedia dell'arte]]''. [[Angelo Beolco|Ruzante]] (1502–1542), [[Carlo Goldoni]] (1707–1793), and [[Carlo Gozzi]] (1720–1806) used the Venetian dialect extensively in their comedies.

Venice has also inspired writers from abroad. Shakespeare set ''[[Othello]]'' and ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' in the city, as did [[Thomas Mann]] his novel, ''[[Death in Venice]]'' (1912). The French writer [[Philippe Sollers]] spent most of his life in Venice and published ''A Dictionary For Lovers of Venice'' in 2004.

The city features prominently in [[Henry James]]'s ''[[The Aspern Papers]]'' and ''[[The Wings of the Dove]]''. It is also visited in [[Evelyn Waugh]]'s ''[[Brideshead Revisited]]'' and [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''. Perhaps the best-known children's book set in Venice is ''The Thief Lord'', written by the German author [[Cornelia Funke]].

Venice is described in [[Goethe]]'s [[Italian Journey]], 1786–1788. He describes the architecture, including a church by [[Palladio]] and also attends the opera. He visits the shipbuilding yards at the [[Arsenal]]. He is fascinated by the street life of Venice, which he describes as a kind of performance.

The poet [[Ugo Foscolo]] (1778–1827), born in [[Zakynthos|Zante]], an island that at the time belonged to the Republic of Venice, was also a [[revolutionary]] who wanted to see a free republic established in Venice following its fall to [[Napoleon]].

Venice also inspired the poetry of [[Ezra Pound]], who wrote his first literary work in the city. Pound died in 1972, and his remains are buried in Venice's [[:commons:Category:Cimitero di San Michele (Venice)|cemetery island]] of [[Isola di San Michele|San Michele]].

Venice is also linked to the technological aspects of writing. The city was the location of one of Italy's earliest printing presses called [[Aldine Press]], established by [[Aldus Manutius]] in 1494.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Barolini |first1=Helen |title=Aldus and His Dream Book |date=1992 |publisher=Italica Press, Inc. |location=New York, New York |isbn=0-934977-22-4}}</ref> From this beginning Venice developed as an important typographic centre. Around fifteen percent of all printing of the fifteenth century came from Venice,<ref>John Rylands University library Manchester, ''The introduction of printing in Italy: Rome, Naples and Venice''</ref> and even as late as the 18th century was responsible for printing half of Italy's published books.{{Citation needed |date=February 2010}}

==== In literature and adapted works ====
The city is a particularly popular setting for essays, novels, and other works of fictional or non-fictional literature. Examples of these include:
* [[Aretino]]'s works (1492–1556)
* [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Merchant of Venice]]'' ({{circa|1596–1598}}) and ''[[Othello]]'' (1603).
* [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Volpone]]'' (1605–6).
* [[Casanova]]'s autobiographical [[Histoire de ma vie|''History of My Life'']] {{circa|1789–1797}}.
* [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Candide]]'' (1759).
* [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]] wrote poetry for two pictures of Venice; one for ''The Embarkation'', drawn by [[Clarkson Stanfield]] for The Amulet, 1833, the other for ''Santa Salute'', drawn by [[Charles Bentley (painter)|Charles Bentley]] for the Literary Souvenir, 1835.
* [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s ''[[Across the River and into the Trees]]'' (1950).
* [[Italo Calvino]]'s ''[[Invisible Cities]]'' (1972).
* [[Anne Rice]]'s ''[[Cry to Heaven]]'' (1982).
* [[Donna Leon]]'s Commissario Guido Brunetti [[crime fiction]] series and cookbook, and the German television series based on the novels (1992–2019).
* [[Philippe Sollers]]' ''[[Watteau in Venice]]'' (1994).
* [[Michael Dibdin]]'s ''[[Dead Lagoon]]'' (1994), one in a series of novels featuring Venice-born policeman Aurelio Zen.
* [[Jacqueline Carey]]'s ''[[Kushiel's Chosen]]'' (2002), an [[historical fantasy]] or [[alternate history]] of Venice – complete with masquerades, canals, and a doge – taking place in a city known as La Serenissima.
* [[John Berendt]]'s ''The City of Falling Angels'' (2005)
* [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s [[comic opera]] ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889)
* [[Thomas Mann]]'s novella, ''[[Death in Venice]]'' (1912), was the basis for Benjamin Britten's [[Death in Venice (opera)|eponymous opera]] (1973).

=== Printing ===
By the end of the 15th century, Venice had become the European capital of printing, having 417 printers by 1500, and being one of the first cities in Italy (after Subiaco and Rome) to have a printing press, after those established in Germany. The most important printing office was the [[Aldine Press]] of [[Aldus Manutius]]; which in 1497 issued the first printed work of [[Aristotle]]; in 1499 printed the ''[[Hypnerotomachia Poliphili]]'', considered the most beautiful book of the [[Renaissance]]; and established modern [[punctuation]], page format, and [[italic type]].

=== Painting ===
{{Main|Venetian painting|List of painters and architects of Venice}}

[[File:Canaletto - Bucentaur's return to the pier by the Palazzo Ducale - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|An 18th-century view of Venice by Venetian artist [[Canaletto]]]]

Venice, especially during the [[Renaissance]], and [[Baroque]] periods, was a major centre of art and developed a unique style known as the [[Venetian painting]]. In the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, Venice, along with [[Florence]] and Rome, became one of the most important centres of art in Europe, and numerous wealthy Venetians became patrons of the arts. Venice at the time was a rich and prosperous [[Maritime Republics|Maritime Republic]], which controlled a vast sea and trade empire.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/arthistory10one/a/ven_ren.htm |title=The Renaissance in Venice – Art History Basics on the Venetian School – ca 1450–1600 |publisher=Arthistory.about.com |date=29 October 2009 |access-date=22 April 2010 |archive-date=28 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128120134/http://arthistory.about.com/cs/arthistory10one/a/ven_ren.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In the 16th century, Venetian painting was developed through influences from the Paduan School and [[Antonello da Messina]], who introduced the oil painting technique of the [[Van Eyck]] brothers. It is signified by a warm colour scale and a picturesque use of colour. Early masters were the Bellini and Vivarini families, followed by [[Giorgione]] and [[Titian]], then [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]]. In the early 16th century, there was rivalry in Venetian painting between the ''disegno'' and ''colorito'' techniques.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.webexhibits.org/feast/context/venetianart.html |title=Venetian art around 1500 |publisher=Webexhibits.org |access-date=22 April 2010}}</ref>

[[Canvas]]es (the common painting surface) originated in Venice during the early Renaissance. In the 18th century, Venetian painting had a revival with [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo|Tiepolo]]'s decorative painting and [[Canaletto]]'s and [[Guardi]]'s panoramic views.

=== Venetian architecture ===
{{Main|Venetian Gothic architecture|Venetian Renaissance architecture}}

[[File:Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti WB.jpg|thumb|The [[Palazzo Cavalli-Franchetti]] is an example of Venetian Gothic architecture alongside the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]].]]
[[File:Ca' d'Oro facciata.jpg|thumb|The [[Ca' d'Oro]]]]

Venice is built on unstable mud-banks, and had a very crowded city centre by the Middle Ages. On the other hand, the city was largely safe from riot, civil feuds, and invasion much earlier than most European cities. These factors, with the canals and the great wealth of the city, made for unique building styles.

Venice has a rich and diverse [[architectural style]], the most prominent of which is the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] style. [[Venetian Gothic architecture]] is a term given to a Venetian building style combining the use of the Gothic [[lancet window|lancet arch]] with the curved [[ogee arch]], due to [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Ottoman architecture|Ottoman]] influences. The style originated in 14th-century Venice, with a confluence of [[Byzantine]] style from [[Constantinople]], Islamic influences from [[Islamic Spain|Spain]] and Venice's eastern trading partners, and early Gothic forms from mainland Italy.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Chief examples of the style are the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] and the [[Ca' d'Oro]] in the city. The city also has several [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] buildings, including the [[Ca' Pesaro]] and the [[Ca' Rezzonico]].

Venetian taste was conservative and [[Renaissance architecture]] only really became popular in buildings from about the 1470s. More than in the rest of Italy, it kept much of the typical form of the Gothic ''palazzi'', which had evolved to suit Venetian conditions. In turn the transition to [[Baroque architecture]] was also fairly gentle. This gives the crowded buildings on the Grand Canal and elsewhere an essential harmony, even where buildings from very different periods sit together. For example, round-topped arches are far more common in Renaissance buildings than elsewhere.

[[File:Ca' Rezzonico (Venice).jpg|thumb|The [[Baroque]] [[Ca' Rezzonico]]]]

=== Rococo style ===
It can be argued that Venice produced the best and most refined [[Rococo]] designs. At the time, the Venetian economy was in decline. It had lost most of its maritime power, was lagging behind its rivals in political importance, and its society had become decadent, with tourism increasingly the mainstay of the economy. But Venice remained a centre of fashion.<ref name="Miller 2005 p.82">Miller (2005) p.82</ref> Venetian rococo was well known as rich and luxurious, with usually very extravagant designs. Unique Venetian furniture types included the ''divani da portego'', and long rococo couches and ''pozzetti'', objects meant to be placed against the wall. Bedrooms of rich Venetians were usually sumptuous and grand, with rich damask, velvet, and silk drapery and curtains, and beautifully carved rococo beds with statues of [[putti]], flowers, and angels.<ref name="Miller 2005 p.82" /> Venice was especially known for its [[Girandole|girandole mirrors]], which remained among, if not the, finest in Europe. Chandeliers were usually very colourful, using [[Murano glass]] to make them look more vibrant and stand out from others; and precious stones and materials from abroad were used, since Venice still held a vast trade empire. Lacquer was very common, and many items of furniture were covered with it, the most noted being ''lacca povera'' (poor lacquer), in which allegories and images of social life were painted. Lacquerwork and [[Chinoiserie]] were particularly common in bureau cabinets.<ref>Miller (2005) p.83</ref>

=== Glass ===
{{Main|Venetian glass}}

[[File:Venetian glass goblet.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[Venetian glass]] [[goblet]]]]

Venice is known for its ornate glass-work, known as [[Venetian glass]], which is world-renowned for being colourful, elaborate, and skilfully made. Many of the important characteristics of these objects had been developed by the 13th century. Toward the end of that century, the centre of the Venetian glass industry moved to [[Murano]], an offshore island in Venice. The glass made there is known as [[Murano glass]].

Byzantine craftsmen played an important role in the development of Venetian glass. When [[Constantinople]] was sacked in the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204, some fleeing artisans came to Venice; when the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] took Constantinople in 1453, still more glassworkers arrived. By the 16th century, Venetian artisans had gained even greater control over the colour and transparency of their glass, and had mastered a variety of decorative techniques. Despite efforts to keep Venetian glassmaking techniques within Venice, they became known elsewhere, and Venetian-style glassware was produced in other Italian cities and other countries of Europe.

Some of the most important brands of glass in the world today are still produced in the historical glass factories on Murano. They are: Venini, Barovier & Toso, [[Pauly & C. - Compagnia Venezia Murano|Pauly]], Millevetri, and Seguso.<ref>Carl I.

In February 2021, the world learned that Venetian glass [[trade beads]] had been found at three prehistoric [[Inuit]] sites in [[Alaska]], including Punyik Point. Uninhabited today, and located {{Convert|1|mi|km}} from the [[Continental Divide]] in the [[Brooks Range]], the area was on ancient trade routes from the [[Bering Sea]] to the [[Arctic Ocean]]. From their creation in Venice, researchers believe the likely route these artifacts traveled was across [[Europe]], then [[Eurasia]] and finally over the [[Bering Strait]], making this discovery "the first documented instance of the presence of indubitable European materials in prehistoric sites in the western hemisphere as the result of overland transport across the Eurasian continent." After [[radiocarbon dating]] materials found near the beads, archaeologists estimated their arrival on the continent to sometime between 1440 and 1480, predating [[Christopher Columbus]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Venetian Glass Beads Found in Arctic Alaska Predate Arrival of Columbus |url=http://www.sci-news.com/archaeology/venetian-glass-beads-arctic-alaska-09357.html |access-date=18 February 2021 |publisher=Sci-News |date=16 February 2021}}</ref> The dating and provenance has been challenged by other researchers who point out that such beads were not made in Venice until the mid-16th century and that an early 17th century French origin is possible.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Geggel |first1=Laura |title=European beads found in Alaska predate Columbus, controversial study claims |url=https://www.livescience.com/blue-glass-beads-predate-columbus-in-alaska.html |access-date=19 January 2022 |work=[[Live Science]] |date=11 February 2021 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Blair |first1=Elliot H. |title=Reconsidering the Precolumbian Presence of Venetian Glass Beads in Alaska |journal=American Antiquity |date=July 2021 |volume=86 |issue=3 |pages=638–642 |doi=10.1017/aaq.2021.38 |s2cid=236162517 |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-antiquity/article/abs/reconsidering-the-precolumbian-presence-of-venetian-glass-beads-in-alaska/AA4A54ADE2EB416A447EBB6A12EC7831 |access-date=19 January 2022 |language=en |issn=0002-7316}}</ref>

The [[Carnival of Venice]] is held annually in the city, It lasts for around two weeks and ends on [[Shrove Tuesday]]. [[Venetian mask]]s are worn.

The [[Venice Biennale]] is one of the most important events in the arts calendar. In 1895 an ''Esposizione biennale artistica nazionale'' (biennial exhibition of Italian art) was inaugurated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/biennale/history/origin/en/7823.html |title=The Venice Biennale: History of the Venice Biennale |website=[[Venice Biennale]] |access-date=28 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110084931/http://www.labiennale.org/en/biennale/history/origin/en/7823.html |archive-date=10 January 2009}}</ref> In September 1942, the activities of the Biennale were interrupted by the war, but resumed in 1948.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/biennale/history/origin/en/7823.3.html |title=The Venice Biennale: History From the beginnings until the Second World War (1893–1945) |website=Venice Biennale |access-date=28 March 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110084405/http://www.labiennale.org/en/biennale/history/origin/en/7823.3.html |archive-date=10 January 2009}}</ref>

The [[Festa del Redentore]] is held in mid-July. It began as a feast to give thanks for the end of the plague of 1576. A bridge of barges is built connecting Giudecca to the rest of Venice, and fireworks play an important role.

The [[Venice Film Festival]] ({{langx|it|Mostra Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica di Venezia}}) is the oldest film festival in the world.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/29/arts/29iht-vfest29.html |title=Special Report – Venice Film Festival; World's Oldest Cinematic Fest Turns 80 |last=Morris |first=Roderick Conway |date=29 August 2012 |work=The New York Times |access-date=17 January 2018 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> Founded by Count [[Giuseppe Volpi di Misurata]] in 1932 as the ''Esposizione Internazionale d'Arte Cinematografica'', the festival has since taken place every year in late August or early September on the island of the [[Lido di Venezia|Lido]].

=== Music ===
{{Main|Music of Venice}}
{{See also|Venice in media|Venetian polychoral style|Music of Veneto|Venetian School (music)}}

[[File:La Fenice Opera House from the stage.jpg|thumb|[[La Fenice]] opera house in the city]]

The city of Venice in Italy has played an important role in the development of the [[music of Italy]]. The Venetian state (the medieval [[Republic of Venice]]) was often popularly called the "Republic of Music", and an anonymous Frenchman of the 17th century is said to have remarked that "In every home, someone is playing a musical instrument or singing. There is music everywhere."<ref>Touring Club p. 79</ref>

During the 16th century, Venice became one of the most important musical centres of Europe, marked by a characteristic style of composition (the [[Venetian School (music)|Venetian school]]) and the development of the [[Venetian polychoral style]] under composers such as [[Adrian Willaert]], who worked at [[St Mark's Basilica]]. Venice was the early centre of music printing; [[Ottaviano Petrucci]] began publishing music almost as soon as this technology was available, and his publishing enterprise helped to attract composers from all over Europe, especially from France and [[Flanders]]. By the end of the century, Venice was known for the splendor of its music, as exemplified in the "colossal style" of [[Andrea Gabrieli|Andrea]] and [[Giovanni Gabrieli]], which used multiple choruses and instrumental groups. Venice was also the home of many noted composers during the [[baroque music|baroque period]], such as [[Antonio Vivaldi]], [[Tomaso Albinoni]], [[Ippolito Ciera]], [[Giovanni Picchi]], and [[Girolamo Dalla Casa]], to name but a few.

==== Orchestras ====
Venice is the home of numerous orchestras such as, the [[La Fenice|Orchestra della Fenice]], [[Rondò Veneziano]], Interpreti Veneziani, and [[Venice Baroque Orchestra]].

=== Cinema, media, and popular culture ===

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Venetian cuisine|Veneto wine}}
Venetian cuisine is characterized by seafood, but also includes garden products from the islands of the lagoon, rice from the mainland, game, and [[polenta]]. Venice is not known for a particular cuisine of its own: it combines local traditions with influences stemming from age-old contacts with distant countries.{{clarify|date=August 2015}} These include ''[[Sarde in saor|sarde in saór]]'' (sardines marinated to preserve them for long voyages); ''bacalà mantecato'' (a recipe based on Norwegian [[stockfish]] and extra-virgin olive oil); ''bisàto'' (marinated eel); ''risi e bisi'' – rice, peas and (unsmoked) bacon;<ref>Ranieri da Mosto, ''Il Veneto in cucina'', Firenze, Aldo Martello-Giunti, 1974, p. 57; Mariù Salvatori de Zuliani, ''A tola co i nostri veci. La cucina veneziana'', Milano, Franco Angeli, 2008, p. 63</ref> ''fegato alla veneziana'', Venetian-style veal liver; ''risòto col néro de sépe'' (risotto with cuttlefish, blackened by their own ink); ''cichéti'', refined and delicious tidbits (akin to ''tapas''); ''antipasti'' (appetizers); and ''[[prosecco]]'', an effervescent, mildly sweet wine.

In addition, Venice is known for the golden, oval-shaped cookies called ''[[baicoli|baìcoli]]'', and for other types of sweets, such as: ''pan del pescaór'' (bread of the fisherman); cookies with almonds and pistachio nuts; cookies with fried Venetian cream, or the ''bussolài'' ([[butter biscuit]]s and [[shortbread]] made in the shape of a ring or an "S") from the island of Burano; the ''galàni'' or ''cróstoli'' ([[angel wings]]);<ref group="note">In other areas of Italy similar sweets are known by many other names, e.g. ''cénci'' (rags) (Florence), ''frappe'' (flounces) (Rome), ''bugìe'' (lies) (Turin, Genoa, etc.), ''chiàcchiere'' (chatter) (Milan and many other places in northern, central and southern Italy).

La cucina veneziana'', Milano, Franco Angeli, 2008, pp. 449–450</ref>

The dessert [[tiramisu|tiramisù]] is generally thought to have been invented in [[Treviso]] in the 1970s,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/17/italian-regions-battle-over-who-invented-tiramisu-in-long-runnin/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/05/17/italian-regions-battle-over-who-invented-tiramisu-in-long-runnin/ |archive-date=10 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Italian regions battle over who invented tiramisu |first=Nick |last=Squires |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |date=17 May 2016 |via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}{{cbignore}}</ref> and is popular in the [[Veneto]] area.

=== Fashion and shopping ===
[[File:Rialto IMG 3996.JPG|thumb|upright|Luxury shops and boutiques along the [[Rialto Bridge]]]]

In the 14th century, many young Venetian men began wearing tight-fitting multicoloured hose, the designs on which indicated the ''Compagnie della Calza'' ("Trouser Club") to which they belonged. The Venetian Senate passed [[sumptuary law]]s, but these merely resulted in changes in fashion in order to circumvent the law. Dull garments were worn over colourful ones, which then were cut to show the hidden colours resulting in the spread of men's "slashed" fashions in the 15th century.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

Today, Venice is a major fashion and shopping centre; not as important as [[Milan]], [[Florence]], and Rome, but on a par with [[Verona]], [[Turin]], [[Vicenza]], [[Naples]], and [[Genoa]]. [[Roberta di Camerino]] is the only major [[Italian fashion]] brand to be based in Venice. Founded in 1945, it is renowned for its innovative handbags made by Venetian artisans and often covered in locally woven [[velvet]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Patner |first=Josh |title=From Bags to Riches |newspaper=The New York Times |date=26 February 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/style/tmagazine/t_w_p166_talk_patner_.html |access-date=14 May 2010}}</ref>
