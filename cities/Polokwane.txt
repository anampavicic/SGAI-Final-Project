It is the country's largest urban centre north of [[Gauteng]]. It was one of the nine host cities of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

==History==

=== Early history ===
[[File:Battles of the nineteenth century (1901) (14595756098).jpg|left|thumb|401x401px|The Boer War (1901)]]
In the 1840s, [[Voortrekker]]s under the leadership of [[Andries Potgieter|Andries Hendrik Potgieter]] established [[Schoemansdal, Limpopo|Zoutpansbergdorp]], a town {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the north. This settlement had to be abandoned because of clashes with the local tribes (Lebelo, Langa & Ledwaba clans), they founded a new town in 1886 and named it "Pietersburg" in honour of Voortrekker leader [[Petrus Jacobus Joubert]]. A small number of Indian/Asian and coloured people settled into the region before the end of the 19th century. It was the capital of the [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]] and the [[Orange Free State (province)|Orange Free State]] for a short time in 1900 at the time of the [[Second Boer War]] from 1899 to 1902.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Polokwane {{!}} City, Limpopo, Safari {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Polokwane |access-date=2024-04-22 |website=www.britannica.com }}</ref> The [[British Empire|British]] occupied Pietersburg in 1901 and built a [[British concentration camps|concentration camp]] to [[incarcerate]] almost 4,000 [[Boer]] women and children.  
[[File:Pietersburg Camp, c.1901. (22473806473).jpg|none|thumb|Pietersburg Camp (1901)]]

=== Years of apartheid ===
Like many places in [[South Africa]] at the time of [[apartheid]], racial segregation and inequality were fundamentally ingrained into the town,<ref name="Donaldson 69–83">{{Cite journal |last1=Donaldson |first1=S. E. |last2=van der Merwe |first2=I. J. |date=February 1999 |title=Urban transformation and social change in Pietersburg during transition |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/10289852.1999.10520169 |journal=Society in Transition |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=69–83 |doi=10.1080/10289852.1999.10520169 |issn=1028-9852}}</ref> following the end of the Second Boer War, together with the formation of the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910, institutional laws were in place in terms of divided [[urban planning]] which were implemented continuously throughout this era. The commencement of apartheid in 1948 meant that Pietersburg was clearly segregated in both [[Residential area|residential regions]] and for business ventures.<ref name="Donaldson 69–83"/> 
[[File:ApartheidSignEnglishAfrikaans.jpg|none|thumb|A sign prohibiting non-whites to use public amenities reserved only for whites]]


The institutionalization of the notorious [[Group Areas Act|Group Areas Act in 1950 and its amendments in 1966]] ensured that the [[Spatial planning|spatial development]] of the [[Central business district|Central Business District (CBD)]] was  exclusively for whites and other regions of the CBD being exclusively for other races such as "Indian centre" for Indians/Asians, many regions were designated to only a specific race of people such as the suburbs of Nirvana and [[Westenburg|Westernburg]] at the northwest of the town only being occupied by Indian/Asian and Coloured groups respectively, while the suburb of Bendor being reserved for Whites. The [[township]]s of [[Seshego]] and [[Mankweng]] were occupied by the Black population. Removals of minority groups for white residency, whites-only owned industrial sectors and a regular barrier between people of different races were heavily enforced.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Donaldson |first1=S.

=== Since 1994 ===
The [[town]] officially became a [[city]] on 23 April 1992 and on 27 April 1994, it became the capital of the newly formed Northern Transvaal province (Later changed to "Northern province" and thereafter Limpopo) following the [[1994 South African general election|1994 South African general elections]].  On 25 February 2005, [[List of renamed places in South Africa|the government declared the official name of the city as Polokwane]], a name that was generally in use by the speakers of [[Northern Sotho language|Northern Sotho (Sepedi)]]. The city was host to the [[52nd National Conference of the African National Congress|52nd national conference of the African National Congress]],  held in December 2007 at the [[University of Limpopo]] and saw [[Jacob Zuma]] voted as President of the [[African National Congress|ANC]], beating former president [[Thabo Mbeki]].<ref>{{cite news |date=19 December 2007 |url=http://www.economist.com/node/10328276 |title=South Africa: Zuma comes out on top |newspaper=The Economist}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sahistory.org.za/article/52nd-anc-national-conference-polokwane-2007|title=The 52nd ANC National Conference - Polokwane 2007 {{!}} South African History Online|website=www.sahistory.org.za|access-date=2019-11-18}}</ref> 

Today the city of Polokwane has seen respectable development in terms of its infrastructure and services as provides a wide variety of shopping venues and malls, restaurants, entertainment venues, religious venues, civic halls, as well as modern housing developments and office buildings.

== Political Governance ==
The [[Polokwane Local Municipality|Polokwane Municipality]] is run by the African National Congress (ANC) with a 60% majority obtained in the latest 2021 Municipal Elections. In a by-election held on 24 April 2024, Ward 10 was won by ANC councillor candidate [https://mankwengnews.co.za/mankweng/anc-defeats-eff-in-ward-10-polokwane/ Willie Madikoto] after the arrest and resignation of the previous [[Economic Freedom Fighters|Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)]] councillor Jacob Seshokadue due to alleged theft of firearms.

== Ailing Infrastructure and Poor Service Delivery ==
Despite the number developments the city has seen, it has been plagued with persistent issues of poor service delivery, which has led to crucial infrastructure such as electricity, water, and sewage systems to continuously be sought after in the various communities that are constantly effected by their unavailability. Public infrastructure such as traffic and street lights, roads, and sidewalks are also amongst the many problems the city's municipality faces.

</div>

==Demographics==
The population in 2011 was about 130,000 . Roughly 45.9% of people in the city are Sepedi (Northern Sotho) speakers.  A large portion of the white population are [[Afrikaners]], and roughly 10,000 residents (roughly 8%) are English-speaking whites who are primarily [[British diaspora in Africa|South Africans of British descent]] and [[White Zimbabweans]], the latter of whom primarily moved to the area since 2000. Roughly 6.7% of people are [[Venda people]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://census2011.adrianfrith.com/place/974044|title = Census 2011: Main Place: Polokwane}}</ref>

===Roads===
[[File:NelsonMandelaCircle.jpg|right|370x370px|thumb|Nelson Mandela road traffic island on the approach to the city]]
The city lies roughly halfway between Gauteng ({{convert|300|km
}}) and the Zimbabwean border ({{convert|200|km}}) on the [[N1 road (South Africa)|N1 highway]], which connects Zimbabwe with the major cities of South Africa, such as [[Pretoria]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Bloemfontein]], and [[Cape Town]].

The [[R37 (South Africa)|R37]] provincial route connects the city with [[Mbombela]]. Running east, the [[R71 (South Africa)|R71]] connects the city with [[Tzaneen]], [[Phalaborwa]], [[Bushbuckridge]], and the [[Kruger National Park]]. To north-east, is the [[R81 (South Africa)|R81]] connecting the city with [[Giyani]] and [[Malamulele]]. The [[R521 (South Africa)|R521]] connects the city with [[Alldays, Limpopo|Alldays]] and the [[R567 (South Africa)|R567]] via [[Seshego]] connects Polokwane with the [[N11 (South Africa)|N11]]. The [[R71 (South Africa)|R71]] is also well known to bikers who ride through the city annually, making it the biggest bike meeting in Africa.

The Nelson Mandela road traffic island is situated on the outskirts of Polokwane when approaching from the direction of Johannesburg. It was built prior to the 2010 FIFA World Cup as part of beautifying the city for the event.

A number of private bus services run in the city and also services connect Polokwane to other major centres in the country.

===Air===
The city is served by two airports. A public airport, the [[Polokwane International Airport]], {{airport codes|PTG|FAPP}}<ref>{{cite web |title=FAPP - Polokwane Intl, ZA - Airport - Great Circle Mapper |url=http://www.gcmap.com/airport/FAPP |access-date=10 February 2010}}</ref> which is to the north of the city, while the smaller Pietersburg Civil Aerodrome {{airport codes||FAPI}} is at the south-east of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pietersburg Civil airport, Limpopo, South Africa |url=http://za.geoview.info/pietersburg_civil,6301543 |access-date=2018-06-16 |website=za.geoview.info }}</ref>

==Coats of arms==

===Municipal (1)===
By 1931, the Pietersburg municipal council had assumed a pseudo-heraldic "coat of arms". The shield depicted a crossed pick and shovel, two crossed wheatsheaves, and the date 1904 surrounded by a rib and bearing the motto {{lang|la|[[Labor omnia vincit]]}}. The crest was an ostrich.<ref name=cig>The arms were depicted on a [http://www.ngw.nl/heraldrywiki/index.php?title=Category:UTC_South_African_town_arms cigarette card] issued in 1931.</ref>

[[File:Pietersburg (Polokwane) Coat of Arms 1931 to 1967.jpg|thumb|The Coat of Arms of Pietersburg from 1931 to 1967]]

=== Municipal (2) ===
A proper coat of arms was designed in the 1960s. It was registered with the Transvaal Provincial Administration in August 1967<ref name=og>Transvaal ''Official Gazette'' 3288 (30 August 1967).</ref> and at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] in September 1969.<ref name=boh>http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za{{dead link|date=July 2017}}</ref>

The arms were : ''Azure, on a fess Argent, between in chief a lion passant Argent, armed and langued Gules, and in base two chevrons humette, and a horseshoe Argent, placed 2 and 1, two cogwheels Gules''. In layman's terms, this was a blue shield displaying, from top to bottom, a silver lion with red tongue and claws, a silver stripe bearing two red cogwheels, and two silver chevrons and a horseshoe.

The crest was a golden eagle, and the motto, once again, was ''Labor omnia vincit''.
[[File:SADF era Pietersburg Commando emblem.jpg|thumb|The Coat of Arms of Pietersburg from 1967 to 2003]]

===Municipal (3)===
The Pietersburg municipal council registered a new coat of arms at the Bureau in October 2003.<ref name="boh"/>

The arms are: ''Vert, on a fess Argent, a woven grain basket, between two hoes with blades turned inward proper, their handles towards centre-base counterchanged Or and issuant from a voided cogwheel the inner ring cotised Argent, therein a sun Or; on a chief of the last a short-clawed Lark (''Mirafra chuana'') perched upon a leaf of the silky thorn tree (''Acacia rehmanniana'') proper, between two demi-peaks with points embattled Brunatre, issuant from the respective shield flanks''. In layman's terms, the shield depicts, from top to bottom, (1) a short-clawed lark perched on an acacia leaf between two stylised peaks, (2) a woven grain basket between two hoes on a silver background, and (3) a silver cogwheel on a green background.

Above the shield is a brown rustic crown. The motto is ''Unity - Equity - Progress - Prosperity''.
