==Geography==
[[Image:Praded letecky pohled 01.jpg|thumb|150px| Aerial view of [[Praděd]]]]
The total area of the region amounts to 5,267&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, which is 6.7% of the entire area of the Czech Republic.
The northern part of the region is of mountainous nature. The [[Hrubý Jeseník|Jeseníky mountains]] are located here, including [[Praděd]], which is the highest point of the region (1,492 m above sea level). The southern part of the region consists of the Hanakian lowland. The lowest point of the region is situated on the water level of the [[Morava (river)|Morava River]] near to [[Kojetín]] in the [[Přerov District]] (190 m above sea level).
The [[Morava (river)|Morava river]] flows through the region and the majority of the region's territory belongs to Morava's [[drainage basin]]. A small northern part of the region belongs to the drainage basin of [[Oder|Odra River]], which flows to the [[Baltic Sea]].
The Olomouc Region offers a great variety of natural points of interest. [[Protected areas of the Czech Republic|Protected landscape area]] of the Jeseníky mountains offers a number of scenic places such as the largest Moravian peatbog Rejvíz and the 45m high Vysoký Waterfall. Another scenic place is [[Dlouhé stráně Hydro Power Plant|Dlouhé Stráně]] water reservoir situated on the top of a hill. Protected landscape area Litovelské Pomoraví offers floodplain forests with many endangered species of plants and animals. Finally, many caves can be found in the region: Javoříčko Caves ({{langx|cs|Javoříčské jeskyně}}), Mladeč Caves ({{langx|cs|Mladečské jeskyně}}) and Zbrašov aragonite caves ({{langx|cs|Zbrašovské jeskyně}}).<ref name="czso.cz">Characteristics of the Olomoucký Region, Available online at: http://www.czso.cz/csu/2010edicniplan.nsf/engt/F80031C6B4/$File/71101110chen.pdf</ref>

The Olomouc Region is an industrial area with developed services. The economy of the
[[Haná|Hanakian]] districts is more stable and diverse than the economy of the Jeseník District and northern part of the Šumperk District. The latter two districts belong to economically weaker regions due to their position, transport accessibility and disturbance of social and economic life after the [[World War II|Second World War]] ([[Expulsion of Germans from Czechoslovakia|displacement of German population]]).

Significant sectors of the region's economy are agriculture, food industry, textile and clothing industry, manufacture of machinery, optics and optical equipment.
In 2011, there were 138,970 businesses, organisations and entrepreneurs based in the region. Most of them were private entrepreneurs registered according to the trade law (76.6%) and business companies (8.4%). 157 industrial enterprises had 100 or more employees, employing in total 41,222 employees.

===Agriculture===
The share of [[arable land]] was 39.4% in 2011 but was showing a decreasing trend over past years while the share of non-agricultural land has been increasing and reached 46.9% in 2011.
Southern and central parts of the region belong to areas with the most fertile land. Crop yields ([[barley]], [[wheat]], rape and industrial sugar beet) reach the highest amounts of the entire country.

===Transport===
Transport accessibility of the region is provided by 3,582&nbsp;km of roads, of which only 12.3% are first class roads. The motorways with two lanes connect [[Olomouc]] with [[Brno]] (I/46), [[Ostrava]] (I/35 followed by [[D1 motorway (Czech Republic)|D1]]) and the [[Pardubice Region]] (I/35). Once finished, the [[D1 motorway (Czech Republic)|d1 motorway]] will connect [[Brno]] with [[Ostrava]] and will cross the southern part of Olomouc Region.
There is 601&nbsp;km of railways in the region. Important rail junctions are in [[Olomouc]] and [[Přerov]]. The railway network is spread equally all over the Region´s territory. Road network is denser in the southern flat part of the Region.
Near to the city of Olomouc there is an airport for small airliners, which obtained status of an international airport.

===Tourism===
The Olomouc Region belongs to regions with the smallest number of accommodation establishments. In 2009 there were 338 collective accommodation establishments. These were placed primarily in the [[Jeseník District]] and the [[Šumperk District]] that are most visited by tourists.<ref name="czso.cz"/>

==Quality of life==
In 2011, 14,347 crimes were committed in the region, of which 6,744 (47%) were solved.
