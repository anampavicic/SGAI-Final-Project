Kumagaya has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa'') characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Kumagaya is 14.0&nbsp;°C. The average annual rainfall is 1532&nbsp;mm with September as the wettest month.

Kumagaya is known for being one of the hottest areas in summer in Japan. This is caused by very hot winds from Tokyo and the [[Chichibu]] basin in the west of the prefecture. In central Tokyo, the summer [[monsoon]] enhanced by [[sea breeze]] is heated by the [[urban heat island]]. Also, from the Chichibu Mountains, the [[Föhn]] blows. The two winds converge above the city at about 2 p.m.

On August 16, 2007, the city recorded air temperature of {{convert|40.9|°C}}, breaking the 74-year record for the [[List of weather records|highest temperature recorded]] in Japan. {{Nihongo|"Very Hot!

==History==
Kumagaya was part of ancient [[Musashi Province]] and was controlled by various [[samurai]] clans from the [[Heian period]]. One of these clans, the Kumagaya clan, rose to prominence during the [[Kamakura period]].

[[Kumagai-shuku]] developed as a [[shukuba|post town]] on the [[Nakasendō]] highway during this period. After the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Kumagaya was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889.
