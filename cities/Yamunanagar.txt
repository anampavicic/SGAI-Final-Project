'''Yamunanagar''' ({{audio|  Yamuna Nagar.ogg|pronunciation}}), is a [[city]] and a [[municipal corporation]] in [[Yamunanagar district]] in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Haryana]]. This town is known for the cluster of plywood units and paper  factories. It provides timber to larger industries. The older town is called [[Jagadhri]]. The [[Jagadhri railway station|Yamunanagar-Jagadhri railway station]] (YJUD) services the city. Despite its name, Jagadhri Railway  is situated in Yamunanagar. There is also another railway station called Jagadhri Workshop in Yamunanagar.

==History==
This town was part of [[Ambala district]] before it was made as separate district in November 1989. The town was formerly known as Abdullahpur and Jamnanagar. Before the Independence, it was a small village with most of the population lived around the railway station, which increased as a result of the migration of refugees from [[West Punjab]] after the partition.<ref>{{cite web |title=At a glance |url=http://www.haryanatourism.gov.in/Yamuna%20Nagar-at-a-glance |website=haryanatourism.gov.in |access-date=10 September 2020}}</ref>

==Geography==
Yamunanagar has the river [[Yamuna]] (its namesake) running through the district, which forms the eastern boundary with the neighbouring Saharanpur district. This boundary is also a state boundary, as [[Saharanpur]] is in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. The district also separates the Yamuna system from the Satluj river system.

From Yamunanagar, the Yamuna river enters the plain area for the first time. The historical river Saraswati also originates from [[Adi Badri, Haryana|Adi badri]], also located in the district. Towards its northern edge is a sub-mountainous region, which has more forest cover and many streams; it is the area where the river Yamuna flows out of the hills and into the plains. The northern boundary is also an interstate boundary with the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]] to the north. [[Sirmaur district|Sirmour]] in Himachal is the district to its north with the towns of [[Nahan]] and [[Paonta Sahib]] close to the boundary with Yamunanagar.{{Cn|date=March 2023}}

===Climate===
Record High – 47.9 
degrees 
Record Low – -0.5 degrees 
Record rainfall (24 hours) – 383mm in Jagadhri on 14 July 2016 .

Average Rainfall of Monsoon – 891&nbsp;mm. [[Chhachhrauli]] and Bilaspur tehsils are the rainiest Tehsils in Haryana. They are known as "The Cherapunjjis of Haryana". [[Loo (wind)|Loo]] blows generally between 15 May to 20 June. Fog is common in December, January and February.

===Rivers===
The [[Western Yamuna Canal]] of the river [[Yamuna]] flows on one side of the city. This canal serves the irrigation needs of the farmers. The canal has century-old path ways, known locally as ''pattris'', on both sides, which serve as connecting routes between villages even today and also help the irrigation department to maintain the canal and serve as a perfect scenic walk—with water on one side and green lush farms on other. The Yamuna river marks the boundary of the district with the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], which borders the city on the eastern side. The neighbouring city is [[Saharanpur]] in the state of Uttar Pradesh. The district borders the state of [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Sirmaur district|Sirmaur]] being the district and the towns of [[Nahan]] and [[Paonta Sahib]] being the towns nearby. Tajewala headworks—from where the Yamuna canal is diverted—also lies north of the city. [[Jagadhri]] is an adjoining town famous for its industrial brass sheet and stainless steel industry.
