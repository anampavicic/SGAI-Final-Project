===British Mandate ===
Bat Yam, originally Bayit VeGan ("House and Garden"),<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/29955621 |title=Territorial stigma formation in the Israeli city of Bat Yam, 1950-1953 |journal=Journal of Historical Geography |volume=39 |pages=113–124 |access-date=2020-08-23 |archive-date=2021-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529130004/https://www.academia.edu/29955621/Territorial_stigma_formation_in_the_Israeli_city_of_Bat_Yam_1950_1983_planning_people_and_practice |url-status=live |last1=Cohen |first1=Nir |date=January 2013 |doi=10.1016/j.jhg.2012.07.004 }}</ref> was founded in 1919 by the Bayit VeGan homeowners association, affiliated with the [[Mizrachi (religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] movement. The association was formed to establish a religious [[garden suburb]] in [[Jaffa]]. By March 1920, it had 400 members. In 1921, {{convert|1,500|dunam|acre}} of land were purchased, of which 1,400 were formally registered by 1923.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} In September 1924, an urban blueprint was approved by the association.  In early 1926, the plots were divided up and a lottery was held to determine who would build first. By October 1926, roads and water supply were complete. Six families settled on the land in cabins. According to a report in 1927, ten houses were under construction. A synagogue was dedicated in October 1928. By then there were 13 families living in Bat Yam and a total of 20 houses.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}
 
In the wake of the 1929 Arab riots, the residents were evacuated by the British army and their homes were turned into barracks. The soldiers left at the end of 1931. In 1932, the residents began to return and were joined by others. In November 1933, 85 families were living in the neighborhood. By early 1936, there were 300 homes and a population of 1400. Local industry began to develop, a movie theatre opened and a hotel was established. The first school, named after [[Tachkemoni]], was founded in 1936. The first headmaster was Haim Baruch Friedman.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.d-schiffer.de/hanna/barucheng.html |title=Rabbi Dr. Haim Baruch Friedman, 1900-1985 |access-date=2020-08-23 |archive-date=2009-01-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114085633/http://www.d-schiffer.de/hanna/barucheng.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
 
In December 1936, Bayit VeGan was declared a [[Local council (Israel)|local council]]. It encompassed 3,500 dunams, 370 dunams of which were Arab-owned. In December 1937, the name was formally changed to Bat Yam (literally "daughter of the sea").<ref>{{cite journal | title = Notice (23rd December 1937) | journal = The Palestine Gazette| volume = 745 | year = 1937 | page = 1287 | author = W.

===State of Israel===
After the establishment of the state in 1948, Bat Yam grew dramatically due to mass immigration. It gained city status in 1958.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bat-Yam |title=Britannica.com: Bat Yam |access-date=2020-08-23 |archive-date=2020-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814085227/https://www.britannica.com/place/Bat-Yam |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Demography==
A small [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] enclave of [[Bobov (Hasidic dynasty)|Bobover Hasidim]], known as Kiryat Bobov, was established in 1958.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://advocacy.ou.org/ou_mourns_the_passing_of_the_bobover_rebbe/ |title=OU mourns the passing of the Bobover rebbe |access-date=2020-08-23 |archive-date=2021-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529130005/https://advocacy.ou.org/ou_mourns_the_passing_of_the_bobover_rebbe/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Interlanguage link|The Bat Yam City Hall|HE|בית עיריית בת ים}} was designed by the architects [[Zvi Hecker]], {{Interlanguage link|Eldar Sharon|HE|אלדר שרון}} and [[Alfred Neumann (architect)|Alfred Neumann]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=בחזרה אל בנייניו של האדריכל המרתק והנשכח אלפרד ניומן |language=he |work=הארץ |url=https://www.haaretz.co.il/gallery/architecture/2012-01-18/ty-article/0000017f-e599-da9b-a1ff-edff1d8a0000 |access-date=2023-02-23}}</ref> When it was built between 1960 and 1963, the building stood alone in the heart of the dunes and was exposed to the coastline of Bat-Yam. The building was designed in the form of an inverted pyramid, in [[Brutalist architecture]] style.

== Local government ==
In the early 2000s, after financial scandals under the leadership of [[Yehoshua Sagi]], the city was on  the brink of bankruptcy. In 2003, he was replaced by [[Shlomo Lahiani]], founder of the 
Bat Yam Berosh Muram (Bat Yam Heads-Up) party. In 2008, he was re-elected with 86% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/education/1.1297119 |title=שלומי לחיאני, ה"שריף" של בת-ים, זכה ב-86% מהקולות בבחירות |newspaper=הארץ |access-date=2014-09-09 |archive-date=2014-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916011759/http://www.haaretz.co.il/news/education/1.1297119 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2014, Lahiani pleaded guilty to three counts of breach of public trust after being charged with bribery and income tax fraud.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.589716 |title=Bat Yam mayor plea bargain a good deal for all |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=2014-05-09 |access-date=2014-09-19 |archive-date=2014-10-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141010234602/http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/.premium-1.589716 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 2014, after the Bat Yam municipality petitioned the  [[Israeli Supreme Court]], Interior Minister [[Gideon Saar]] appointed a steering committee to explore the possibility of incorporating the city as part of Tel Aviv-Yafo as a way of reviving its stagnant economy. Later that year, when Gideon Sa’ar was replaced by [[Gilad Erdan]], a decision was reached to transfer funding to Bat Yam directly from the state budget. The plan for unification was postponed until the next municipal elections in 2023. In 2019, Bat Yam's current mayor, Tzvika Brot, said he opposed the union with Tel Aviv.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/israel-news/1700644/mk-maklev-visits-bat-yam-meeting-with-mayor-and-party-activists.html |title=MK Maklev visits Bat Yam, meeting with mayor and party activists |date=25 March 2019 |access-date=2020-08-26 |archive-date=2021-05-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529130006/https://www.theyeshivaworld.com/news/israel-news/1700644/mk-maklev-visits-bat-yam-meeting-with-mayor-and-party-activists.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
