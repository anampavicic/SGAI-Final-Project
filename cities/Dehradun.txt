==Etymology==
Dehradun is made up of two words "dehra" + "dun." "dehra" is a Hindi word with the meaning of temple, whose etymology is: "dev" + "ghar", from [[Prakrit]] "devahara."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/mcgregor_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE&searchhws=yes|title = The Oxford Hindi-English dictionary|year = 1993}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/dasa-hindi_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B9%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE&searchhws=yes|title=Hindi sabdasagara}}</ref> "dūn" (or Hindi दून derives from the Sanskrit droṇī (or द्रोणि) and means "a tract of country lying at the foot of hills; a valley"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/mcgregor_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A8&searchhws=yes|title = The Oxford Hindi-English dictionary|year = 1993}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/app/dasa-hindi_query.py?qs=%E0%A4%A6%E0%A5%82%E0%A4%A8&searchhws=yes&matchtype=exact|title = Hindi sabdasagara}}</ref>

The town was established when [[Baba Ram Rai]], the son of the seventh [[Sikh]] Guru, [[Guru Har Rai]] built a ''gurudwara'' or temple in the area in the 17th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V11_218.gif|title = Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 11, page 212 -- Imperial Gazetteer of India -- Digital South Asia Library}}</ref> Ram Rai was sent by his father as an emissary to the Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] in Delhi. Aurangzeb objected to a verse in the Sikh scripture (''Asa ki Var'') that stated, "the clay from a Musalman(Muslim)'s grave is kneaded into potter's lump", considering it an insult to Islam. Baba Ram Rai explained that the text was miscopied and modified it, substituting "Musalman" with "Beiman" (faithless, evil) which Aurangzeb approved.<ref name=eosramrai>[https://archive.org/details/TheEncyclopediaOfSikhism-VolumeIiiM-r/page/n477 Ram Rai], Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Editor in Chief: Harbans Singh, Punjab University</ref><ref name="McLeod2014p260"/> This led Guru Har Rai to bar his son from his presence, and name his younger son as his successor. Aurangzeb responded by granting Baba Ram Rai a [[jagir]] (land grant) in Garhwal region ([[Uttarakhand]]). The town later came to be known as Dehradun, after ''Dehra'' referring to Baba Ram Rai's shrine.<ref name="McLeod2014p260">{{cite book|author1=Louis E. Fenech|author2=W. H.

In the [[Skanda Purana]], Dun is mentioned as a part of the region called Kedarkhand, the abode of [[Shiva]]. According to Hindu mythology, in ancient India during the [[Mahabharata]] epic era, [[Dronacharya]], the great teacher of [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]], lived here, hence the name of "Dronanagari" (lit. ''city of [[Drona]]'').<ref>[[History of Dehradun]]</ref><ref>Natural Resource Management By B. W. Pandey (ed.

== History ==
{{Main | History of Dehradun}}
[[File:Doon Valley, Dehradun, 1850s.jpg|thumb|left|Doon Valley, Dehradun, 1850s]]
The history of the city of [[Uttarakhand]], Dehradun (nicknamed "Doon Valley") is linked to the story of [[Ramayana]] and [[Mahabharata]]. It is believed that after the battle between [[Ravana]] and Rama, Rama and his brother [[Lakshmana]] visited this site. Also, known as 'Dronanagari' on the name of [[Dronacharya]], legendary Royal guru to the [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]] in the epic Mahabharata, is believed to have been born and resided in Dehradun.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |title=A Brief History of Dehradun |publisher=District Institute of Education and Training, Dehradun |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519221815/http://gov.ua.nic.in/schooleducation/DIET/diet_dehradun/district_profile.htm |archive-date=19 May 2007 }}</ref> Evidence such as ancient temples and idols have been found in the areas surrounding Dehradun which have been linked to the mythology of Ramayana and Mahabharata. These relics and ruins are believed to be around 2000 years old. Furthermore, the location, the local traditions and the literature reflect this region's links with the events of Mahabharata and Ramayana. Even after the battle of Mahabharata, the Pandavas had an influence on this region as the rulers of [[Hastinapura]] with the descendants of [[Subahu]] ruled the region as subsidiaries. Likewise, [[Rishikesh]] is mentioned in the pages of history when [[Vishnu]] answered the prayers of the saints, slaughtered the demons and handed the land to the saints. The adjoining place called [[Chakrata]] has its historical impression during the time of Mahabharata.

In the seventh century, this area was known as Sudhanagara and was described by the Chinese traveller [[Huen Tsang]]. Sudhanagara later came to be recognised as [[Kalsi]]. [[Edicts of Ashoka]] have been found in the region along the banks of the river [[Yamuna]] in Kalsi indicating the wealth and importance of the region in ancient India. In the neighbouring region of Haripur, ruins were discovered from the time of King Rasala which also reflect the region's prosperity. It was under control of Garhwal for many centuries. 

Fateh Shah, a Garhwal king, donated three villages in Dehradun to Sikh guru Ram Rai. Before the name of Dehradun was used, the place is shown on old maps as Gurudwara (a map by Webb, 1808) or Gurudwara (a map by Gerard, 1818). Gerard's map names the place as "Dehra or Gurudwara". Surrounding this original Sikh temple were many small villages that are now the names of parts of the modern city.
[[File:Guru Ram Rai Temple, Dehradun, 1858.jpg|thumb|[[Guru Ram Rai Darbar Sahib]] in 1858. The construction of the present building was completed in 1707.]]
Dehradun itself derives its name from the historical fact that [[Baba Ram Rai]], the eldest son of the Seventh Sikh Guru Har Rai, set up his "Dera" (camp) in "dun" (valley) in 1676. This 'Dera Dun' later on became Dehradun.

The Mughal Emperor [[Aurangzeb]] was highly impressed by the miraculous powers of charismatic Ram Rai. He asked the contemporary Maharaja of Garhwal, [[Fateh Shah]] to extend all possible help to Ram Rai. Initially, a Gurudwara (temple) was built in Dhamawala. The construction of the present building, [[Guru Ram Rai Darbar Sahib]], was completed in 1707. There are portraits of gods, goddesses, saints, sages and religious stories on the walls. There are pictures of flowers and leaves, animals and birds, trees, similar faces with pointed noses and big eyes on the arches which are the symbol of the colour scheme of [[Pahari art|Kangra-Guler art]] and [[Mughal art]]. High minarets and round pinnacles are the models of Muslim architecture. The huge pond in the front measuring {{convert|230 x 80|feet}} had dried up for want of water over the years. People had been dumping rubbish; it has been renovated and revived.

Dehradun was invaded by [[Mahmud of Ghazni]] during his campaigns into India followed by [[Timur]] in 1368, Rohilla chief [[Najib ad-Dawlah]] in 1757 and [[Ghulam Kadir|Ghulam Qadir]] in 1785. In 1804 battles of Khurbura at Dehradun fought between Garhwal king Pradyuman shah and Gorakhali forces led by General Amar Singh thapa.in which king Pradyuman shah died then this area came under control of Gorakha. In 1806 the Nepalese warlord ''Kaji'' [[Amar Singh Thapa]] under the central leadership of Prime Minister [[Mukhtiyar]] [[Bhimsen Thapa]] united many of the Indian territories that now fell under places such as [[Almora]], [[Pathankot]], [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]], [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]], [[Sirmur State|Sirmur]], [[Shimla]], [[Kangra district|Kangra]] and Dehradun.

On the western front Garhwal and parts of [[Himachal Pradesh]] up to [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and on the eastern front the state of [[Sikkim]] up to [[Darjeeling]] became parts of Nepal for a brief period until the British [[East India Company]] went to [[Anglo-Nepalese War|war]] from 1814 to 1816. The war ended with the signing of the [[Sugauli Treaty|Treaty of Sugowli]] where almost a third was ceded to British East India company. The British got Dehradun in 1816 and colonised [[Landour]] and [[Mussoorie]] in 1827–1828.

He spent his last few days here before passing away in Delhi in 1964.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/news/2012/may/270512-How-Nehru-spent-his-last-four-days.htm|title=How Nehru spent his last four days|publisher=Mid-day.com|access-date=8 December 2014|archive-date=4 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604034646/http://www.mid-day.com/news/2012/may/270512-How-Nehru-spent-his-last-four-days.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Another leader from the independence movement, [[Rash Behari Bose]], who was one of the key organisers of the [[Ghadar conspiracy]] and, later, the [[Indian National Army]] was based in Dehradun in his early days before he was forced to move to Japan in 1915 to continue the freedom struggle.

Post-independence Dehradun and other parts of [[Garhwal Kingdom|Garhwal]] and [[Kumaon Kingdom|Kumaon]] were merged with [[United Provinces (1937-1950)|United Provinces]] which was later renamed the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]]. In 2000, Uttarakhand state (earlier called Uttaranchal) was created from the northwestern districts of Uttar Pradesh under the [[Uttar Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2000]]. Dehradun was made its interim capital.
