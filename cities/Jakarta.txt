Lying on the northwest coast of [[Java]], the world's [[List of islands by population|most populous island]], Jakarta is the [[List of cities in ASEAN by population|largest metropole]] in [[Southeast Asia]] and serves as the [[diplomatic capital]] of [[ASEAN]]. The Special Capital Region has a status equivalent to that of a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] and is bordered by two other provinces: [[West Java]] to the south and east; and (since 2000, when it was separated from West Java) [[Banten]] to the west. Its coastline faces the [[Java Sea]] to the north, and it shares a maritime border with [[Lampung]] to the west. [[Jakarta metropolitan area|Jakarta's metropolitan area]] is [[List of ASEAN country subdivisions by GDP|ASEAN's second largest economy]] after [[Singapore]]. In 2023, the city's [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] PPP was estimated at US$724.010&nbsp;billion.

Jakarta is the economic, cultural, and political centre of Indonesia. Although Jakarta extends over only {{cvt|661.23|km2|}} and thus has the smallest area of any [[Provinces of Indonesia|Indonesian province]], its [[Jakarta metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] covers {{cvt|7,076.31|km2|}}, which includes the satellite cities of [[Bogor]], [[Depok]], [[Tangerang]], [[South Tangerang]], and [[Bekasi]], and has an estimated population of 32.6&nbsp;million {{as of|2022|lc=y}}, making it the [[List of metropolitan areas in Indonesia|largest urban area in Indonesia]] and the [[List of largest cities|second-largest in the world]] (after [[Greater Tokyo Area|Tokyo]]). Jakarta ranks [[List of Indonesian provinces by Human Development Index|first among the Indonesian provinces]] in the [[Human Development Index|human development index]]. Jakarta's business and employment opportunities, along with its ability to offer a potentially higher [[standard of living]] compared to other parts of the country, have attracted migrants from across the Indonesian [[archipelago]], making it a melting pot of numerous cultures.

Jakarta is one of the [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|oldest continuously inhabited cities in Southeast Asia]]. Established in the fourth century as [[Sunda Kelapa]], the city became an important trading port for the [[Sunda Kingdom]]. At one time, it was the ''de facto'' capital of the [[Dutch East Indies]], when it was known as [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. Jakarta was officially a city within [[West Java]] until 1960 when its official status was changed to a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] with [[Capital districts and territories#Indonesia|special capital region]] distinction. As a province, its government consists of five administrative cities and one [[Thousand Islands (Indonesia)|administrative regency]]. Jakarta is an [[Global city#GaWC study|alpha world city]] and the ASEAN secretariat's seat. Financial institutions such as the [[Bank Indonesia|Bank of Indonesia]], [[Indonesia Stock Exchange]], and corporate headquarters of numerous [[List of companies of Indonesia|Indonesian companies]] and [[multinational corporation]]s are located in the city.

Jakarta's main challenges include rapid urban growth, ecological breakdown, air pollution, gridlocked traffic, congestion, and [[Floods in Jakarta|flooding]] due to subsidence (sea level rise is relative, not absolute). Part of North Jakarta is sinking up to 17&nbsp;cm (6.7&nbsp;inches) annually, meanwhile the southern part is relatively safe. This has made the northern part of the city more prone to flooding and one of the fastest-sinking capitals in the world. In response to these challenges, in August 2019, President [[Joko Widodo]] announced plans to [[Capital of Indonesia#Relocation to Nusantara|move the capital]] from Jakarta to the planned city of [[Nusantara (planned city)|Nusantara]], in the province of [[East Kalimantan]] on the island of [[Borneo]]. The [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPR]] approved the move on 18 January 2022. The Indonesian government is not abandoning Jakarta after announcing plans to move the country's capital, its planning minister said, pledging to spend US$40 billion, which is more than the cost to build [[Nusantara (city)|Nusantara]], to save the city in the next decade.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Suroyo |first1=Gayatri|title=Indonesia pledges $40 billion to modernise Jakarta ahead of new capital - minister |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/world/indonesia-pledges-40-billion-to-modernise-jakarta-ahead-of-new-capital-minister-idUSKCN1VJ0FT/ |access-date=17 May 2024}}</ref>

==Name==
Jakarta has been home to multiple [[Human settlement|settlements]]. Below is the list of names used during its existence:
* [[Buni culture|Buni people]] (400 BC–500 AD)
* [[Tarumanegara|Sundapura]] (358–669)
* [[Sunda Kelapa]] (669–1527)
* {{flagicon|Banten Sultanate}} Jayakarta (1527–1619)
* {{flagicon|Dutch East Indies}} [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (1619–1949)
* {{flagicon|Indonesia}} Djakarta (1942–1972)
* {{flagicon|Indonesia}} Jakarta (1972–present)

The [[Buni culture|Buni people]] is a prehistoric [[clay pottery]] culture that flourished in coastal northern [[West Java]],  [[Jakarta]] and [[Banten]] around 400 BC to 100 AD{{sfn|Zahorka|2007}}{{pn|date=October 2024}} and survived until 500 AD.

[[Tarumanegara|Sundapura]] are the earliest [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] records in the western part of the archipelago. The geographical position of coastal [[West Java]], which corresponds to today modern [[Jakarta]], is a commanding region that controls the Sunda Strait. This location is strategic in regard to [[Sumatra]], and also its connection to Asian continent of [[India]] and [[China]].

After fall of the Tarumanegara, the name of city was change to 'Sunda Kelapa' or 'Coconut of Sunda', growing to be the main harbour for the [[Sunda Kingdom]], due to its desirable location.<ref name="names">{{cite news |url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/01/28/the-capitals-childhood-names.html |title=The capital's 'childhood' names |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |access-date=28 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190128191351/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/01/28/the-capitals-childhood-names.html |archive-date=28 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.exploresunda.com/batavia-jakarta.html |title=Sunda Kelapa - Batavia - Jakarta Jakarta's History in a Glance|work=Explore Sunda |access-date=14 April 2024}}</ref>

The name 'Jakarta' is derived from the word ''Jayakarta'' ([[Devanagari]]: जयकर्त) which is ultimately derived from the [[Sanskrit]] जय ''jaya'' (victorious),<ref>{{cite web |work=Sanskrit Dictionary |title=jaya |url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&beginning=0+&tinput=jaya&trans=Translate&direction=SE |access-date=11 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731043538/http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&beginning=0+&tinput=jaya&trans=Translate&direction=SE |archive-date=31 July 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and कृत ''krta'' (accomplished, acquired),<ref>{{cite web |work=Sanskrit Dictionary |title=krta |url=http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&beginning=0+&tinput=krta+&trans=Translate&direction=SE |access-date=11 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731044135/http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&beginning=0+&tinput=krta+&trans=Translate&direction=SE |archive-date=31 July 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref> thus ''Jayakarta'' translates as 'victorious deed', 'complete act' or 'complete victory'. It was named for the Muslim troops of [[Fatahillah]] which successfully defeated and drove the Portuguese away from the city in 1527, eventually renaming it 'Jayakarta'.<ref name="jakarta-news-2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.beritajakarta.com/english/AboutJakarta/HistoryofJakarta.asp |title=History of Jakarta |work=Jakarta News |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110820052725/http://www.beritajakarta.com/english/AboutJakarta/HistoryofJakarta.asp |archive-date=20 August 2011}}</ref> [[Tomé Pires]], a Portuguese apothecary, wrote the name of the city in [[Suma Oriental|his magnum opus]] as ''Jacatra'' or ''Jacarta''{{sfn|Cortesão|1990|pp=27–32}} during his journey to the [[East Indies]].

After the Dutch East India Company took over the area in 1619, they renamed it to 'Batavia', after the [[Batavi (Germanic tribe)|Batavi]], a Germanic tribe who were seen as the ancestors of the Dutch. The city was then also known as {{lang|nl|Koningin van het Oosten}} (Queen of the Orient), a name that was given for the urban beauty of [[Kota, Jakarta|downtown Batavia's]] [[Gracht|canals]], mansions and ordered city layout.{{sfn|Kampen|1831|p=291}} After expanding to the south in the 19th century, this nickname came to be more associated with the suburbs (e.g. [[Menteng]] and the area around [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]]), with their wide lanes, green spaces and villas.<ref>{{in lang|nl}} "{{lang|nl|Batavia zoals het weent en lacht}}", (17 October 1939), {{lang|nl|Het Nieuws van den Dag voor Nederlandsch-Indië}}, p. 6</ref> During the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation]], the city was renamed as {{nihongo||ジャカルタ特別市|''Jakaruta Tokubetsu-shi''|Jakarta Special City}}.<ref name="names"/> After the Japanese surrender, the name was changed to 'Jakarta'.<ref name="names" />

The north coast area of western Java including Jakarta was the location of prehistoric [[Buni culture]] that flourished from 400 BC to 100 AD.{{sfn|Zahorka|2007|p=?}} The area in and around modern Jakarta was part of the 4th-century [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] kingdom of [[Tarumanagara]], one of the oldest [[Hindu]] kingdoms in Indonesia.{{sfn|Ayatrohaédi|2005|p=?}} The area of [[North Jakarta]] around [[Kampung Tugu|Tugu]] became a populated settlement in the early 5th century. The [[Tugu inscription]] (probably written around 417 AD) discovered in Batutumbuh hamlet, Tugu village, [[Koja, Jakarta|Koja]], [[North Jakarta]], mentions that King [[Purnawarman]] of Tarumanagara undertook hydraulic projects; the irrigation and water drainage project of the Chandrabhaga river and the Gomati river near his capital.{{sfn|Hellman|Thynell|Voorst|2018|p=182}} Following the decline of [[Tarumanagara]], its territories, including the Jakarta area, became part of the Hindu [[Sunda Kingdom|Kingdom of Sunda]]. From the 7th to the early 13th century, the port of Sunda was under the [[Srivijaya]] maritime empire. According to the Chinese source, ''[[Zhu Fan Zhi|Chu-fan-chi]]'', written circa 1225, [[Zhao Rukuo|Chou Ju-kua]] reported in the early 13th century that Srivijaya still ruled Sumatra, the Malay peninsula, and western Java ([[Sunda Kingdom|Sunda]]).{{sfn|Bunge|Vreeland|1983|p=3}} The source says the port of Sunda is strategic and thriving, mentioning [[Black pepper|pepper]] from Sunda as among the best in quality. The people worked in agriculture, and their houses were built on wooden piles.{{sfn|Ayatrohaédi|2005|p=60}} The harbour area became known as [[Sunda Kelapa]] ([[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]: {{Sund|ᮞᮥᮔ᮪ᮓ ᮊᮨᮜᮕ}}) and by the 14th century, it was an important trading port for the Sunda Kingdom.

The first European fleet, four Portuguese ships from [[Malacca]], arrived in 1513 while looking for a route to obtain spices.{{sfn|Heuken|1999|p=?}} The Sunda Kingdom [[Luso Sundanese padrão|made an alliance treaty]] with the Portuguese by allowing them to build a port in 1522 to defend against the rising power of [[Demak Sultanate]] from central Java.<ref name="jakarta-news-2011" /> In 1527, [[Fatahillah]], a Pasai-born military commander of Demak attacked and conquered Sunda Kelapa, driving out the Portuguese. Sunda Kelapa was renamed Jayakarta,<ref name="jakarta-news-2011" /> and became a fiefdom of the [[Banten Sultanate]], which became a major Southeast Asian trading centre.

Through the relationship with Prince Jayawikarta of the Banten Sultanate, Dutch ships arrived in 1596. In 1602, an English [[East India Company]] (EIC) voyage led by Sir [[James Lancaster]] arrived in [[Aceh]] and sailed on to [[Banten]], where they were allowed to build a trading post. This site became the centre of English trade in the Indonesian archipelago until 1682.{{sfn|Ricklefs|1981|p=?}} Jayawikarta is thought to have made trading connections with the English merchants, who were rivals with the Dutch, by allowing them to build houses directly across from the Dutch buildings in 1615.{{sfn|Heuken|1999|p=?}}

===Colonial era===

[[File:Batavia - Townhall 1770.jpg|thumb|The City Hall of Batavia (''Stadhuis van Batavia''), the seat of the governor-general of the [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] in the late 18th century by [[Johannes Rach]] c. 1770. The building now houses the [[Jakarta History Museum]], [[Jakarta Old Town]]]]
When relations between Prince Jayawikarta and the Dutch deteriorated, his soldiers attacked the Dutch fortress. His army and their EIC allies, however, were defeated by the Dutch, in part owing to the timely arrival of [[Jan Pieterszoon Coen]]. The Dutch burned the EIC trading post and forced them to retreat to their ships. The victory consolidated Dutch power, and they renamed the city ''Batavia'' in 1619.

Commercial opportunities in the city attracted native and especially Chinese and Arab immigrants. This sudden population increase created burdens on the city. Tensions grew as the colonial government tried to restrict Chinese migration through deportations. Following a revolt, 5,000 Chinese were [[1740 Batavia massacre|massacred]] by the Dutch and natives on 9 October 1740, and the following year, Chinese inhabitants were moved to [[Glodok]] outside the city walls.{{sfn|Witton|2003|pp=138–39}} At the beginning of the 19th century, around 400 Arabs and Moors lived in Batavia, a number that changed little during the following decades. Among the commodities traded were fabrics, mainly imported cotton, ''[[batik]]'' and clothing worn by Arab communities.{{sfn|Nas|Grijns|2000|p=145}}

The city began to expand further south as epidemics in 1835 and 1870 forced residents to move away from the port. The ''Koningsplein'', now [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]] was completed in 1818, the housing park of [[Menteng]] was started in 1913,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://travele.co.id/sejarah-perkembangan-kota-jakarta/ |title=Menteng: Pelopor Kota Taman |date=3 November 2007 |publisher=Badan Perencanaan Kotamadya Jakarta Pusat |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220150339/http://www.bapekojakartapusat.go.id/node/42 |archive-date=20 February 2009 |language=id}}</ref> and [[Kebayoran Baru]] was the last Dutch-built residential area.{{sfn|Witton|2003|pp=138–39}} By 1930, Batavia had more than 500,000 inhabitants,{{sfn|Henderson|1970|pp=81–82}} including 37,067 Europeans.{{sfn|Bakker|Kooy|Shofiani|Martijn|2008|p=1891}} The city was expanded in 1935 through the annexation of the town of Meester Cornelis, modern [[Jatinegara]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Sejarah perkembangan Kota Jakarta |date=2000 |publisher=Pemerintah Propinsi Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta, Dinas Museum dan Pemugaran |page=56 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mHpwAAAAMAAJ&q=meester+cornelis+batavia+1935 |language=id}}</ref>

On 5 March 1942, the Japanese captured [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] from Dutch control, and the city was named Jakarta ({{Nihongo|Jakarta Special City|ジャカルタ特別市|Jakaruta tokubetsu-shi}}, under the special status that was assigned to the city). After the war, the Dutch name Batavia was internationally recognised until full Indonesian independence on 27 December 1949. The city, now renamed Jakarta, was officially proclaimed the national capital of Indonesia.

===Independence era===
[[File:Indonesia declaration of independence 17 August 1945.jpg|thumb|[[Sukarno]] reading Proclamation of Indonesian [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Independence]] at Jalan Pegangsaan Timur Number 56 at Menteng]]
After [[World War II]] ended, Indonesian nationalists declared independence on 17 August 1945,{{sfn|Waworoentoe|2013}} and the government of Jakarta City was changed into the Jakarta National Administration in the following month. During the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], Indonesian Republicans withdrew from [[Allies of World War II|Allied]]-occupied Jakarta and established their capital in [[Yogyakarta]].

After securing full independence, Jakarta again became the national capital in 1950.{{sfn|Witton|2003|pp=138–39}} With Jakarta selected to host the [[1962 Asian Games]], [[Sukarno]], envisaging Jakarta as a great international city, instigated large government-funded projects with openly nationalistic and [[modernist architecture]].<ref>{{harvnb|Kusno|2000|p=56}}; {{harvnb|Schoppert|Damais|1997|p=105?}}</ref> Projects included [[Semanggi Interchange|a cloverleaf interchange]], a major boulevard ([[Jalan MH Thamrin (Jakarta)|Jalan MH Thamrin]]-Sudirman), monuments such as [[Monas|The National Monument]], [[Hotel Indonesia]], a shopping centre, and a new building intended to be the headquarters of [[CONEFO]].

Colonial buildings and structures include those that were constructed during the colonial period. The dominant colonial styles can be divided into three periods: the [[Dutch Golden Age]] (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century – 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Colonial architecture is apparent in houses and villas, churches, civic buildings, and offices, mostly concentrated in the [[Jakarta Old Town]] and [[Central Jakarta]]. Architects such as J.C. Schultze and [[Eduard Cuypers]] designed some of the significant buildings. Schultze's works include [[Gedung Kesenian Jakarta|Jakarta Art Building]], the Indonesia Supreme Court Building and [[Ministry of Finance (Indonesia)|Ministry of Finance]] Building, while Cuypers designed [[Bank Indonesia Museum]] and [[Mandiri Museum]]. In the early 20th century, most buildings were built in [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Neo-Renaissance]] style. By the 1920s, the architectural taste had begun to shift in favour of [[Rationalism (architecture)|rationalism]] and [[modernism]], particularly [[Art Deco|art deco]] architecture. The elite suburb [[Menteng]], developed during the 1910s, was the city's first attempt at creating ideal and healthy housing for the middle class. The original houses had a longitudinal organisation, with overhanging eaves, large windows, and open ventilation, all practical features for a tropical climate.<ref>{{cite news |last=Wilson |first=Willy |url=http://m.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/11/building-past.html |title=Building on the Past |work=The Jakarta Post |date=11 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305084422/http://m.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/07/11/building-past.html |archive-date=5 March 2016}}</ref> These houses were developed by N.V. de Bouwploeg, and established by [[Pieter Adriaan Jacobus Moojen|P.A.J.

After independence, the process of nation-building in Indonesia and demolishing the memory of colonialism was as important as the symbolic building of arterial roads, monuments, and government buildings. The [[National Monument (Indonesia)|National Monument]] in Jakarta, designed by Sukarno, is Indonesia's beacon of nationalism. In the early 1960s, Jakarta provided highways and super-scale cultural monuments as well as [[Senayan Sports Stadium]]. The [[DPR/MPR Building|parliament building]] features a hyperbolic roof reminiscent of German rationalist and Corbusian design concepts.{{sfn|Bishop|Phillips|Yeo|2003|p=198}} Built-in 1996, [[Wisma 46]] soars to a height of {{cvt|262|m|abbr=off}} and its nib-shaped top celebrates technology and symbolises stereoscopy.

===Landmarks===
Most landmarks, monuments, and statues in Jakarta were begun in the 1960s during the [[Sukarno]] era, then completed in the [[Suharto]] era, while some date from the colonial period. Although many of the projects were completed after his presidency, Sukarno, who was an architect, is credited for planning Jakarta's monuments and landmarks, as he desired the city to be the beacon of a powerful new nation. Among the monumental projects that were built, initiated, and planned during his administration are the [[National Monument (Indonesia)|National Monument]], [[Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta|Istiqlal mosque]], the [[DPR/MPR Building|Legislature Building]], and the [[Gelora Bung Karno Stadium|Gelora Bung Karno]] stadium. Sukarno also built many nationalistic monuments and statues in the capital city.{{sfn|Silver|2007|p=101}}

===Climate===
Jakarta experiences a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Am'') as classified by the system. The city's [[wet season]] spans most of the year, from October to May. The [[dry season]] lasts from June to September, with each of these months receiving less than {{convert|100|mm|1}} of rainfall on average. Situated in the western part of Java, Jakarta sees its highest rainfall in January and February, averaging {{convert|299.7|mm|1}} per month, while the drier season month is August, with an average rainfall of {{convert|43.2|mm|1}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://waterindonesiaexpo.com/visiting/travel/general-information/|title=General Information|publisher=Water Indonesia|access-date=16 July 2024|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240716145139/https://waterindonesiaexpo.com/visiting/travel/general-information/|archive-date=16 July 2024}}</ref>

Every year faces recurring issues, such as [[floods]] and [[thunderstorms]]. A [[Upper tropospheric cyclonic vortex|cyclonic vortex]] leads to moisture convergence over a large area, including western Java Island. Additionally, this vortex causes a mainly meridional monsoon flow, where near-surface winds blow almost perfectly from north to south over West Java. The impact of these predominant northerly winds hitting the rugged topography in southern West Java likely contributes to the increased convection that causes floods in Jakarta.<ref>{{cite web|title=Monsoon Effect at Flood Phenomena on 2002 and 2007 in DKI-Jakarta|url=http://eprints.undip.ac.id/2067/1/Monsoon_Effect_at_Flood_Phenomena_on_2002_and_2007_in_DKI-Jakarta.pdf|website=UNDIP INSTITUTIONAL REPOSITORY|access-date=22 November 2012|archive-date=22 November 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122074409/http://eprints.undip.ac.id/2067/1/Monsoon_Effect_at_Flood_Phenomena_on_2002_and_2007_in_DKI-Jakarta.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

Jakarta is pluralistic and religiously diverse, without a majority ethnic group.

[[File:Baju Demang Betawi.png|thumb|170px|[[Betawi people|Betawi]] couple wearing traditional dress]]
The '[[Betawi people|Betawi]]' ({{lang|id|Orang Betawi}}, or 'people of Batavia') are immigrant descendants of the old city who became widely recognised as an ethnic group by the mid-19th century. They mostly descend from an eclectic mix of Southeast Asians brought or attracted to meet labour needs.<ref>These cement the pluralism in ethnic and national identities found in contemporary Jakarta;{{harvnb|Knörr|2007|p=263}}</ref> They are thus a Creole ethnic group who came from much of Indonesia. Over generations, most have intermarried with one or more ethnicities, especially people of Chinese, Arab, and European descent.{{sfn|Sáenz|Embrick|Rodriguez|2015|p=?}} Most Betawis lived in the fringe zones with few Betawi-majority zones of central Jakarta.{{sfn|Iyer|2001|p=23}} It is thus a conundrum for some first generation Betawi people, especially multi-generational Jakarta residents, to identify as either their parents' ethnicity or Betawi since living in a Betawi-majority district and speaking more of that creole and adapting is a matter of preference for such families.

A significant [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]] community has lived in Jakarta for many centuries. They traditionally reside around old urban areas, such as [[Pinangsia]], [[Pantai Indah Kapuk|PIK]], [[Pluit]] and [[Glodok]] (Jakarta's Chinatown) areas. They also can be found in the old [[Chinatown]]s of [[Senen]] and [[Jatinegara]]. As of 2001 they self-identified as being 5.5%, which was thought of as under-reported;<ref>{{cite news |last=Johnston |first=Tim |title=Chinese diaspora: Indonesia |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4312805.stm |url-status=live |publisher=BBC News |date=3 March 2005 |access-date=30 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223170116/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4312805.stm |archive-date=23 December 2007}}</ref> this explains the 6.6% figure ten years later.

The Sumatran residents are diverse. According to the 2020 census, roughly 361,000 [[Batak]]; 300,960 [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and 101,370 [[Ethnic Malays|Malays]] lived in the city. The number of Batak people has grown in ranking, from eighth in 1930 to fifth in 2000. [[Toba Batak people|Toba Batak]] is the largest subset in Jakarta.{{sfn|Reid|2010|p=170}} Working Minangkabau in the 1980s in high proportions were well-embedded merchants, artisans, doctors, teachers or journalists.<ref>Board of Editors, Contributions to Southeast Asian Ethnography, 1987</ref>{{sfn|Naim|1971|p=115-131}} [[Minangkabau businesspeople|Minang merchants]] are found in traditional markets, such as Tanah Abang and Senen.{{sfn|Adya|2022|p=125}}

[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is the official and dominant language of Jakarta, while many elderly people speak [[Dutch language|Dutch]] or [[Chinese language|Chinese]], depending on their upbringing. [[English language|English]] is used for communication, especially in Central and South Jakarta.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/world/asia/26indo.html |title=As English Spreads, Indonesians Fear for Their Language |newspaper=The New York Times |date=26 July 2010 |access-date=11 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190811160323/https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/26/world/asia/26indo.html |archive-date=11 August 2019 |url-status=live|last1=Onishi |first1=Norimitsu }}</ref> Each of the ethnic groups uses their mother tongue at home, such as [[Betawi language|Betawi]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], and [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]. The [[Betawi language]] is distinct from those of the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] or [[Javanese people|Javanese]], forming itself as a [[language island]] in the surrounding area. It is mostly based on the East [[Old Malay|Malay]] dialect and enriched by [[loan word]]s from [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]], [[Javanese language|Javanese]], [[Hokkien language|Chinese]], and [[Arabic]]. Over time, many Betawi words and phrases became integrated into Indonesian as Jakartan [[slang]] and are used by most people regardless of their ethnic background. Now it is popular not only in Jakarta but all over Indonesia.

The Chinese in Jakarta mainly speak Indonesian and English due to a strict language ban during [[Soeharto]]'s [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] era; older people may be fluent in [[Hokkien dialect]] and [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]], meanwhile the youngsters are only fluent in Indonesian and English, some educated in Mandarin. With the recent urbanization of Chinese communities from several rural areas in Indonesia, other Chinese dialects have been brought into the Chinese community in Jakarta, such as [[Hakka language|Hakka]], [[Teochew language|Teochew]] and [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]. [[Hokkien]], which is mainly from Sumatra ([[Medan]], [[Bagansiapiapi]], [[Batam]]) is mostly spoken in Northern Jakarta, such as in [[Pantai Indah Kapuk]], [[Pluit]], and [[Kelapa Gading]], meanwhile Hakka and Teochew, which are derived from the Chinese communities in [[Pontianak]] and [[Singkawang]], are mainly spoken in West Jakarta, like in [[Tambora, Jakarta|Tambora]] and [[Grogol Petamburan]]. The Batak in Jakarta mostly speak Indonesian, while the older generation tends to speak their native languages, such as [[Batak language|Batak Toba]], [[Mandailing language|Mandailing]], and [[Karo language (Indonesia)|Karo]], depending on which ancestral towns and places in [[North Sumatra]] they come from. The Minangkabau mainly speak [[Minangkabau language|Minangkabau]] together with Indonesian.

Most of the visitors attracted to Jakarta are domestic tourists. As the gateway of [[Indonesia]], Jakarta often serves as a stop-over for foreign visitors on their way to other Indonesian tourist destinations such as [[Bali]], [[Lombok]], [[Komodo Island]] and [[Yogyakarta]]. In 2023 about 1.97 million foreign tourists visited the city.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://indonesiaexpat.id/news/jakartas-statistics-bureau-reports-an-increase-in-overseas-tourists-in-2023/|title=Jakarta's Statistics Bureau Reports an Increase in Overseas Tourists in 2023|newspaper=Indonesia Expat|accessdate=25 April 2024}}</ref>

Jakarta is trying to attract more international tourist by [[Meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions|MICE]] tourism, by arranging increasing numbers of [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2017/05/06/jakarta-preps-mice-tourism-to-lure-more-tourists.html |title=Jakarta preps MICE tourism to lure more tourists |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |access-date=16 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170610052514/http://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2017/05/06/jakarta-preps-mice-tourism-to-lure-more-tourists.html |archive-date=10 June 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2017/04/29/ministry-holds-national-convention-to-develop-mice-tourism.html |title=Ministry holds national convention to develop MICE tourism |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |access-date=16 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802131043/http://www.thejakartapost.com/travel/2017/04/29/ministry-holds-national-convention-to-develop-mice-tourism.html |archive-date=2 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2012, the tourism sector contributed Rp. 2.6&nbsp;trillion (US$268.5&nbsp;million) to the city's total direct income of Rp. 17.83&nbsp;trillion (US$1.45&nbsp;billion), a 17.9% increase from the previous year 2011.

==Culture==
As the capital of Indonesia, Jakarta is a melting pot of cultures from all ethnic groups in the country. Although [[Betawi people]] are Jakarta's indigenous community, the city's culture represents many languages and ethnic groups, favouring differences in religion, tradition, and linguistics, rather than a single, dominant culture. Jakarta is dominated by [[Javanese people]], followed by Betawi people and [[Sundanese people]].

===Arts and festivals===
[[File:Sang Pawang Ondel Ondel.jpg|thumb|''[[Ondel-ondel]]'' puppets are the mascot of the city and the symbol of [[Betawi people|Betawi]] culture]]
The [[Betawi people|Betawi]] culture is distinct from those of the [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] or [[Javanese people|Javanese]], forming a [[language island]] in the surrounding area. There is a significant Chinese influence in Betawi culture, reflected in the popularity of Chinese cakes and sweets, [[firecracker]]s, and Betawi wedding attire that demonstrates Chinese and Arab influences.

Some festivals such as the ''Jalan Jaksa Festival'', ''Kemang Festival'', ''Festival Condet'' and ''Lebaran Betawi'' include efforts to preserve Betawi arts by inviting artists to display performances.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/23/lebaran-betawi-an-event-maintain-bonds-and-traditions.html |title=Lebaran Betawi: An event to maintain bonds and traditions |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |access-date=27 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727113539/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/08/23/lebaran-betawi-an-event-maintain-bonds-and-traditions.html |archive-date=27 July 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2019/07/27/16343861/festival-condet-2019-upaya-untuk-lestarikan-budaya-betawi |title=Festival Condet 2019, Upaya untuk Lestarikan Budaya Betawi |newspaper=Kompas |access-date=27 July 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190727111921/https://megapolitan.kompas.com/read/2019/07/27/16343861/festival-condet-2019-upaya-untuk-lestarikan-budaya-betawi |archive-date=27 July 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Knörr|2007}}</ref> Jakarta has several performing art centres, such as the classical concert hall Aula Simfonia Jakarta in Kemayoran, [[Taman Ismail Marzuki]] (TIM) art centre in Cikini, [[Gedung Kesenian Jakarta]] near Pasar Baru, Balai Sarbini in the Plaza Semanggi area, [[Bentara Budaya Jakarta]] in the Palmerah area, Pasar Seni (Art Market) in [[Ancol Dreamland|Ancol]], and traditional Indonesian art performances at the pavilions of some provinces in [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]].

Javanese [[wayang wong|Wayang Orang]] performances can be found at Wayang Orang Bharata Theatre.

[[Jakarta Fair]] is held annually from mid-June to mid-July to celebrate the anniversary of the city and is mostly centered around a trade [[fair]]. However, this month-long fair also features entertainment, including arts and music performances by local musicians. [[Jakarta International Java Jazz Festival]] (JJF) is one of the largest jazz festivals in the world, the biggest in the Southern Hemisphere, and is held annually in March.

Several foreign art and culture centres in Jakarta promote culture and language through learning centres, libraries, and art galleries. These include the Chinese [[Confucius Institute]], the Dutch [[Erasmus House (Jakarta)|Erasmus Huis]], the [[British Council]], the French [[Alliance Française]], the German [[Goethe-Institut]], the [[Japan Foundation]], and the [[Indian Council for Cultural Relations|Jawaharlal Nehru Indian Cultural Center]].

{{see also|List of newspapers in Indonesia|List of radio stations in Jakarta|List of television stations in Indonesia}}
Jakarta is home to most of the Indonesian national newspapers, besides some local-based newspapers. Daily local newspapers in Jakarta are ''[[Pos Kota]]'' and ''[[Warta Kota]]'', as well as the now-defunct ''[[Indopos]]''. National newspapers based in Jakarta include ''[[Kompas]]'' and ''[[Media Indonesia]]'', most of them have a news segment covering the city. A number of business newspapers (''[[Bisnis Indonesia]]'', ''[[Investor Daily]]'' and ''[[Kontan]]'') and sports newspaper (''[[Tribun Network|Super Ball]]'') are also published.

Newspapers other than in Indonesian, mainly for a national and global audience, are also published daily. Examples are English-language newspapers ''[[The Jakarta Post]]'' and online-only ''[[Jakarta Globe|The Jakarta Globe]]''. [[Chinese language]] newspapers also circulate, such as ''[[Indonesia Shang Bao]]'' (印尼商报), ''[[Harian Indonesia]]'' (印尼星洲日报), and ''[[International Daily News|Guo Ji Ri Bao]]'' (国际日报). The only [[Japanese language]] newspaper is ''[[The Daily Jakarta Shimbun]]'' (じゃかるた新聞).

Around 75 radio stations broadcast in Jakarta, 52 on the [[Frequency modulation|FM]] band, and 23 on the [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] band. Radio entities are based in Jakarta, for example, national radio networks [[MNC Trijaya FM]], [[Prambors FM]], Trax FM, I-Radio, Hard Rock FM, Delta FM, Global FM and the public radio [[Radio Republik Indonesia|RRI]]; as well as local stations [[Gen 98.7 FM|Gen FM]], [[Radio Elshinta]] and [[Z99.9 FM|PM2FAS]].

Jakarta is the headquarters for Indonesia's public television [[TVRI]] as well as private national television networks, such as [[Metro TV (Indonesian TV network)|Metro TV]], [[TvOne (Indonesian TV network)|tvOne]], [[Kompas TV]], [[RCTI]] and [[NET (Indonesian TV network)|NET]]. Jakarta has local television channels such as [[TVRI Jakarta]], [[JakTV]], Elshinta TV and KTV. Many TV stations are analogue [[PAL]], but some are now converting to digital signals using [[DVB-T2]] following a [[Digital terrestrial television in Indonesia|government plan to digital television migration]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tvdigital.kominfo.go.id/berita/2-siaran-tv-digital.html |title=TV Digital Indonesia – Siaran TV Digital |access-date=7 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701193202/http://www.tvdigital.kominfo.go.id/berita/2-siaran-tv-digital.html |archive-date=1 July 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Government and politics==
{{Main|Governor of Jakarta}}
[[File:Balaikota DKI Jakarta.jpg|thumb|The Jakarta governor's office at the [[Jakarta City Hall]]]]
Jakarta is administratively equal to a [[Provinces of Indonesia|province]] with special status. The executive branch is headed by an elected [[Governor of Jakarta|governor]] and a [[Vice Governor of Jakarta|vice governor]], while the [[Jakarta Regional People's Representative Council]] ({{langx|id|Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Provinsi Daerah Khusus Ibukota Jakarta}}, DPRD DKI Jakarta) is the legislative branch with 106 directly elected members. The [[Jakarta City Hall]] at the south of [[Merdeka Square, Jakarta|Merdeka Square]] houses the office of the governor and the vice governor and serves as the main administrative office.

Executive governance consists of five administrative cities ({{langx|id|Kota Administrasi}}), each headed by a [[mayor]] (w''alikota)'' and one [[Regencies of Indonesia|administrative regency]] ({{langx|id|Kabupaten Administrasi}}) headed by a [[regent]] (''bupati''). Unlike other cities and regencies in Indonesia where the mayor or regent is directly elected, Jakarta's mayors and regents are chosen by the governor. Each city and regency is divided into administrative districts.

Aside from representatives to the provincial parliament, Jakarta sends 21 delegates to the [[People's Representative Council|national lower house parliament]]. The representatives are elected from Jakarta's three national electoral districts, which also include overseas voters.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ini 21 Caleg DPR yang Terpilih dari DKI Jakarta |url=https://news.detik.com/berita/2582777/ini-21-caleg-dpr-yang-terpilih-dari-dki-jakarta |access-date=14 August 2018 |website=detik.com |date=14 May 2014 |language=id |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814103209/https://news.detik.com/berita/2582777/ini-21-caleg-dpr-yang-terpilih-dari-dki-jakarta |archive-date=14 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> It also sends 4 delegates, just like other provinces, to the [[Regional Representative Council|national upper house parliament]].

The Jakarta Smart City (JSC) program was launched on 14 December 2014 with the goal of smart governance, smart people, smart mobility, smart economy, smart living, and a smart environment in the city using the web and various smartphone-based apps.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/01/14/four-years-on-ahoks-smart-city-legacy-lives-on.html |title=Four years on, Ahok's 'Smart City' legacy lives on |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |access-date=14 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190114153327/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2019/01/14/four-years-on-ahoks-smart-city-legacy-lives-on.html |archive-date=14 January 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Public safety===
The [[Greater Jakarta Metropolitan Regional Police]] ({{langx|id|Polda Metro Jaya}}) is the police force that is responsible for maintaining law, security, and order for the [[Jakarta metropolitan area]]. It is led by a two-star police general ([[Inspector General of Police#Indonesia|Inspector General of Police]]) with the title of "Greater Jakarta Regional Police Chief" ({{langx|id|Kepala Kepolisian Daerah Metro Jaya}}, abbreviated {{lang|id|Kapolda Metro Jaya}}). Its office is located at Jl. Jenderal Sudirman Kav. 55, Senayan, Kebayoran Baru, South Jakarta, and their hotline emergency number is 110.

The [[Kodam Jaya|Jayakarta Military Regional Command]] ({{langx|id|Komando Daerah Militer Jayakarta}}, abbreviated {{lang|id|Kodam Jaya}}) is the territorial army of the [[Indonesian Army]], which serves as a defence component for Jakarta and its surrounding areas ([[Greater Jakarta]]). It is led by an army [[Major General]] with the title of "Jakarta Military Regional Commander" ({{langx|id|Panglima Daerah Militer Kodam Jaya}}, abbreviated {{lang|id|Pangdam Jaya}}). The Jakarta Military Command is located at [[East Jakarta]] and oversees several military battalions ready to defend the capital city and its vital installations. It also assists the Jakarta Metropolitan Police during certain tasks, such as supporting security during [[state visit]]s, [[VVIP]] security, and [[riot control]].

===Municipal finances===
The Jakarta provincial government relies on transfers from the central government for the bulk of its income.

===Administrative divisions===
[[File:Special Capital Region of Jakarta.png|thumb|Map of the administrative cities ({{lang|id|Kota administratif}}) in Jakarta province; the Thousand Islands Regency (which is to the north) is shown in the inset to the lower left. Each administrative city is further divided into [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''[[Kecamatan]]'')]]
Jakarta consists of five ''Kota Administratif'' (Administrative cities/municipalities), each headed by a mayor, and one ''Kabupaten Administratif'' ([[Regencies of Indonesia|Administrative regency]]). Each city and regency is divided into districts (''kecamatan''). The administrative cities/municipalities of Jakarta are:
*[[Central Jakarta]] ({{lang|id|Jakarta Pusat}}) is Jakarta's smallest city and administrative and political centre. It is divided into eight districts. It is charactesised by large parks and Dutch colonial buildings. Landmarks include the National Monument ([[Monas]]), [[Istiqlal Mosque, Jakarta|Istiqlal Mosque]], [[Jakarta Cathedral]] and museums.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/jakpus/default.asp |title=Central Jakarta Profile |work=The City Jakarta Administration |publisher=Jakarta.go.id |access-date=19 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911220356/http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/jakpus/default.asp |archive-date=11 September 2009}}</ref>
*[[West Jakarta]] ({{lang|id|Jakarta Barat}}) has the city's highest concentration of small-scale industries. It has eight districts. The area includes Jakarta's Chinatown and Dutch colonial landmarks such as the Chinese Langgam building and [[Toko Merah]]. It contains part of [[Jakarta Old Town]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/jakbar/default.asp |title=West Jakarta Profile |work=The City Jakarta Administration |publisher=Jakarta.go.id |access-date=24 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090911220346/http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/jakbar/default.asp |archive-date=11 September 2009}}</ref>
*[[South Jakarta]] ({{lang|id|Jakarta Selatan}}), originally planned as a satellite city, is now the location of upscale shopping centres and affluent residential areas. It has ten districts and functions as Jakarta's [[groundwater]] buffer,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/jaksel/ |title=South Jakarta Profile |work=The City Jakarta Administration |publisher=Jakarta.go.id |access-date=19 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705203755/http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/jaksel/ |archive-date=5 July 2009}}</ref> but recently the green belt areas are threatened by new developments. Much of the [[central business district]] is concentrated all area in Kebayoran Baru, Setiabudi, a small part in Tebet, Pancoran, Mampang Prapatan, and bordering the Tanah Abang/Sudirman area of Central Jakarta. The area is known as the [[Golden Triangle of Jakarta|Jakarta Golden Triangle]].
*[[East Jakarta]] ({{lang|id|Jakarta Timur}}) territory is characterised by several industrial sectors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/jaktim/default.asp |title=East Jakarta Profile |work=The City Jakarta Administration |publisher=Jakarta.go.id |access-date=19 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091014184630/http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/jaktim/default.asp |archive-date=14 October 2009}}</ref> Also located in East Jakarta are [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]] and [[Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport]]. This city has ten districts.
*[[North Jakarta]] ({{lang|id|Jakarta Utara}}) is bounded by the [[Java Sea]]. It is the location of [[Port of Tanjung Priok]]. Large- and medium-scale industries are concentrated there. It contains part of [[Jakarta Old Town]], which was the centre of [[Dutch East India Company|VOC]] trade activity during the colonial era. Also located in North Jakarta is [[Ancol Dreamland]] ({{lang|id|Taman Impian Jaya Ancol}}), the largest integrated tourism area in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/jakut/default.asp |title=North Jakarta Profile |work=The City Jakarta Administration |publisher=Jakarta.go.id |access-date=19 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090913084331/http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/jakut/default.asp |archive-date=13 September 2009}}</ref> North Jakarta is divided into six districts.

The only administrative regency ({{lang|id|kabupaten}}) of Jakarta is the [[Thousand Islands (Indonesia)|Thousand Islands]] ({{lang|id|Kepulauan Seribu}}), formerly a [[Districts of Indonesia|district]] within North Jakarta. It is a collection of 105 small islands located on the Java Sea. It is of high conservation value because of its unique ecosystems. Marine tourism, such as diving, water bicycling, and windsurfing, are the primary tourist activities in this territory. The main mode of transportation between the islands is speed boats or small ferries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/kepseribu |title="Thousand Island" Profile |work=The City Jakarta Administration |publisher=Jakarta.go.id |access-date=19 December 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090616124511/http://www.jakarta.go.id/en/pemerintahan/kotamadya/kepseribu/ |archive-date=16 June 2009}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
To transform the city into a more livable one, a ten-year ''urban regeneration'' project was undertaken, for Rp 571&nbsp;trillion ($40.5&nbsp;billion). The project aimed to develop infrastructure, including the creation of a better integrated public transit system and the improvement of the city's clean water and wastewater systems, housing, and flood control systems.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/06/21/capital-or-not-jakarta-looks-toward-urban-regeneration.html |title=Capital or not, Jakarta looks toward urban regeneration |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |access-date=21 June 2020 |archive-date=21 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200621164407/https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/06/21/capital-or-not-jakarta-looks-toward-urban-regeneration.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Government-run hospitals are of a good standard but are often overcrowded. Government-run specialised hospitals include [[Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital]], [[Gatot Soebroto Army Hospital]], as well as community hospitals and [[puskesmas]]. Other options for healthcare services include private hospitals and clinics. The private healthcare sector has seen significant changes since the government began allowing foreign investment in the private sector in 2010. While some private facilities are run by nonprofit or religious organisations, most are for-profit. Hospital chains such as [[Siloam Hospitals|Siloam]], Pondok Indah Hospital Group, Mayapada, Mitra Keluarga, Medika, Medistra, Ciputra, Radjak Hospital Group, RS Bunda Group, and [[Hermina Hospitals|Hermina]] operate in the city.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2016/09/27/indonesias-health-care-industry-is-on-the-rise.html |title=Indonesia's health care industry is on the rise |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |access-date=21 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052122/http://www.thejakartapost.com/academia/2016/09/27/indonesias-health-care-industry-is-on-the-rise.html |archive-date=22 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tribunnews.com/nasional/2013/10/25/mayapada-hospital-jakarta-selatan-diresmikan |title=Mayapada Hospital Jakarta Selatan Diresmikan |newspaper=Tribun News |access-date=21 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052329/http://www.tribunnews.com/nasional/2013/10/25/mayapada-hospital-jakarta-selatan-diresmikan |archive-date=22 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Jadwal Dokter|url=https://cloudmedis.com/jadwal-dokter/|website=cloudmedis.com|language=|access-date=2023-05-06}}</ref>

===Water supply===
{{further|Water privatisation in Jakarta}}
Two private companies, PALYJA and Aetra, provide piped water in the western and eastern half of Jakarta respectively under 25-year concession contracts signed in 1998. A public asset holding company called PAM Jaya owns the infrastructure. Eighty percent of the water distributed in Jakarta comes through the West Tarum Canal system from Jatiluhur reservoir on the [[Citarum River]], {{cvt|70|km|0}} southeast of the city. The water supply was privatised by President Suharto in 1998 to the French company [[Suez Environnement]] and the British company [[Thames Water]] International. Both companies subsequently sold their concessions to Indonesian companies. Customer growth in the first seven years of the concessions had been lower than before, possibly because of substantial inflation-adjusted tariff increases during this period. In 2005, tariffs were frozen, leading private water companies to cut down on investments.

According to PALYJA, the service coverage ratio increased substantially from 34% (1998) to 65% (2010) in the western half of the concession.<ref>{{cite web |title=Key Figures |url=http://en.palyja.co.id/profile/key-figures/ |access-date=20 November 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001736/http://en.palyja.co.id/profile/key-figures/ |archive-date=26 April 2012}}</ref> According to data by the Jakarta Water Supply Regulatory Body, access in the eastern half of the city served by PTJ increased from about 57% in 1998 to about 67% in 2004 but stagnated afterward.<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Iwan |first=Renalia |title=Ten Years of Public Private Partnership in Jakarta Drinking Water Service (1998–2007): Eastern Jakarta Drinking Water Service by Thames PAM Jaya |date=2008 |url=http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/978 |language=en-NZ |access-date=16 November 2021 |archive-date=16 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211116222402/http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/978 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, other sources cite much lower access figures for piped water supply to houses, excluding access provided through public hydrants: one study estimated access as low as 25% in 2005,<ref>{{Cite report |url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/disconnected-poverty-water-supply-and-development-jakarta-indonesia |title=Disconnected: Poverty, Water Supply and Development in Jakarta, Indonesia |last1=Bakker |first1=Karen |last2=Kooy |first2=Michelle |date=2006 |publisher=[[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]] |publication-date=2013-10-17 |quote=Personal Communication from Kris Tutuko, Technical Director PAM JAYA, Jakarta, Indonesia (was quoted – seems difficult to understand). |last3=Shofiani |first3=Nur Endah |last4=Martijn |first4=Ernst-Jan |access-date=16 November 2021 |archive-date=29 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220829213725/https://hdr.undp.org/content/disconnected-poverty-water-supply-and-development-jakarta-indonesia |url-status=live }}</ref> while another estimated it to be as low as 18.5% in 2011.<ref>{{cite web |last=KRuHA People's coalition for the water rights |title=Poor Water Service, Most of Jakarta People Threatened by E-Coli |url=http://www.kruha.org/page/en/dinamic_detil/50/194/Press_Releases/Poor_Water_Service__Most_of_Jakarta_People_Threatened_by_E_Coli.html |access-date=20 November 2011 |date=7 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426001731/http://www.kruha.org/page/en/dinamic_detil/50/194/Press_Releases/Poor_Water_Service__Most_of_Jakarta_People_Threatened_by_E_Coli.html |archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Those without access to piped water get water mostly from wells that are often salty and unsanitary.

Jakarta also serves as the seat of [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) Headquarters and is ASEAN's diplomatic capital.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jakarta is Affirmed to be a Diplomatic Capital City |work=Association of Southeast Asian Nations |url=http://www.asean.org/jakarta-is-affirmed-to-be-a-diplomatic-capital-city/ |access-date=28 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531081257/http://asean.org/jakarta-is-affirmed-to-be-a-diplomatic-capital-city/ |archive-date=31 May 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Twin towns – sister cities===
{{See also|List of twin towns and sister cities in Indonesia}}
Jakarta signed [[sister city]] agreements with other cities, including [[Casablanca]]. To promote friendship between the two cities, the main avenue famous for its shopping and business centres was named after Jakarta's Moroccan sister city. No street in Casablanca is named after Jakarta. However, the Moroccan capital city of Rabat has an avenue named after [[Sukarno]], Indonesia's first president, to commemorate his visit in 1960 and as a token of friendship.<ref name="JakartaPost2">{{cite news |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/30/morocco-seeks-boost-business-ties-with-ri-envoy.html |title=Morocco seeks to boost business ties with RI: Envoy |first=Veeramalla |last=Anjaiah |date=30 July 2009 |newspaper=The Jakarta Post |access-date= 14 June 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171114064731/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/30/morocco-seeks-boost-business-ties-with-ri-envoy.html |archive-date=14 November 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Cooperation and friendship===
Jakarta has established a partnership with [[Rotterdam]], especially on integrated urban water management, including capacity-building and knowledge exchange.<ref name="NESO">{{cite news |title=Jakarta and Rotterdam strengthen ties on urban water management |date=16 September 2014 |work=Neso Indonesia |url=http://www.nesoindonesia.or.id/berita/2014/september/jakarta-and-rotterdam-strengthen-ties-on-urban-water-management |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807135334/http://www.nesoindonesia.or.id/berita/2014/september/jakarta-and-rotterdam-strengthen-ties-on-urban-water-management |archive-date=7 August 2016}}</ref> This cooperation is mainly because both cities are dealing with similar problems; they lie in low-lying flat plains and are prone to flooding. Additionally, they have both implemented drainage systems involving canals, dams and pumps vital for both cities for below-sea-level areas.

In addition to its sister cities, Jakarta cooperates with:<ref name=sisters/>
