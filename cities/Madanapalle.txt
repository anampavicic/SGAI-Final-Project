== History ==

Madanapalle was founded by Sri Maadanna in 1618 [[AD]].<ref name=info />

During the early British administration, [[Sir Thomas Munro]], the first Collector of [[Cuddapah]], played a significant role in the development of the town. He constructed a small thatched house at the present-day location of the Collector's bungalow and visited Madanapalle every summer. Munro’s connection with the town is well documented, as he facilitated British control in the region during the early 19th century. Madanapalle and its surrounding areas were formally integrated into the British administration when the region came under their rule in 1800.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hunter |first1=William Wilson |title=The Imperial Gazetteer Of India Vol 16 |date=1908 |publisher=The Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |page=227 |edition=2 |url=https://archive.org/details/the-imperial-gazetteer-of-india-vol-16/page/226/mode/2up}}</ref>

In 1850, Madanapalle was developed as a subdivision under British India, with F.B. Manoly appointed as its first Sub-Collector. Over the years, the town faced several natural calamities, including floods, famines, and epidemics, which shaped its social and economic development.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1996-06-17 |title=Indian cyclone abates after killing more than 120 - India {{!}} ReliefWeb |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/india/indian-cyclone-abates-after-killing-more-120 |access-date=2023-07-12 |website=reliefweb.int |language=en}}</ref>

Madanapalle is also linked to a significant moment in India's national history. In 1919, [[Rabindranath Tagore]] visited the town and stayed at the [[Besant Theosophical College]], where he translated the Indian national anthem, ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'', from [[Bengali language|Bengali]] to English.
