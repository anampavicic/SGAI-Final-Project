Before Miri was founded, [[Marudi, Sarawak|Marudi]] was the administrative centre of the northern region of [[Sarawak]]. Miri was founded in 1910 when the first oil well was drilled by [[Shell plc|Royal Dutch Shell]]. The discovery of an oil field in Miri has led to rapid development of Miri town. Miri became the administrative centre of the northern region of Sarawak by 1929. During [[World War II]], the Miri oil fields were destroyed by the Brooke government to sabotage Japanese operations in [[Southeast Asia]] but to no avail; Miri town was the first landing point of Japanese troops in [[Borneo]]. The subsequent Japanese occupation led Miri to become a target of Allied air raids which caused the destruction of oil refinery facilities in Miri. The petroleum industry continued to be a major player in the city's economy after the war. Oil exploration has moved offshore since the 1950s, but subsequently new inland oil fields were found in 1989 and 2011. In 1974, the formation of Malaysian oil and gas company [[Petronas]] led to co-operation between Petronas and Shell on oil exploration in the Miri region. In 2005, Miri became the 10th city in Malaysia to be granted official city status, the first non-state-capital city to be bestowed such status.

Miri is the main tourist gateway to the world-famous [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]], [[Gunung Mulu National Park]]; [[Loagan Bunut National Park]]; [[Lambir Hills National Park]]; and [[Niah National Park]] and [[Miri-Sibuti Coral Reef National Park]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Diving in Miri-Sibuti Coral Reefs National Park|url=http://sarawaktourism.com/attraction/diving-in-miri-sibuti-coral-reef-national-park/|publisher=Sarawak Tourism Board|access-date=21 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150321094922/http://sarawaktourism.com/attraction/diving-in-miri-sibuti-coral-reef-national-park/|archive-date=21 March 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Miri Nature Society: Coral reefs in Miri under threat|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2010/06/21/miri-nature-society-coral-reefs-in-miri-under-threat/|access-date=21 March 2015|newspaper=The Borneo Post|date=21 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222041018/http://www.theborneopost.com/2010/06/21/miri-nature-society-coral-reefs-in-miri-under-threat/|archive-date=22 February 2014}}</ref> The [[Gunung Mulu National Park]] with its [[Sarawak Chamber]], which is the largest known cave chamber in the world by area, remains one of the favourite [[ecotourism]] destinations in Miri.<ref name=Sarawakvisitorsguidemiri/> Miri is also the birthplace of the Malaysian [[petroleum]] industry.

The local population in Miri has indeed started to extract oil from hand-dug wells for centuries. ''[[Song Huiyao Jigao]]'', a documentation of the [[Song dynasty]] of China, mentions the imports of Borneo [[camphor]] and petroleum in the 11th century. In 1882, Mr de Crespigny reported to the Brooke government on 18 hand-dug oil wells in the Miri area. He also recommended that area near Miri River should be thoroughly explored. However, his recommendations were ignored. But when Charles Hose took over the Resident office in 1891, he was interested in Mr de Crespigny's idea and began to collaborate with him. Mr de Crespigny began to map oil seeps around the Miri area, however a consultant geologist from England discouraged the oil exploration in Miri due to poor logistical conditions. After his retirement from administrative positions in Sarawak, Charles Hose went back to England. He later went to London to discuss the idea of oil exploration in Miri with the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company (later became a part of [[Royal Dutch Shell]] Company in 1907). {{thinspace|H.|N.}} Benjamin, a branch manager from the petroleum company, was interested in this idea. Finally in 1909, Rajah Charles Brooke came to London to sign the first Sarawak Oil Mining Lease. Royal Dutch Shell dispatched a senior geologist named Josef Theodor Erb together with Charles Hose back to Miri. Erb started to map Miri oil fields from August 1909 to July 1910. He also identified a location known as "Miri Hill" (now known as "Canada Hill", {{cvt|150|m}} above sea level) is suitable to act as an [[anticline]] for oil drilling.<ref name=AAPG/><ref name=Geoexpro>{{cite book|last1=Sorkhabi|first1=Rasoul|title=History of oil: Sarawak - Miri 1910|date=2010|publisher=GEO ExPro Magazine Vol 7, No 2|page=44|url=http://www.geoexpro.com/articles/2010/02/miri-1910|access-date=24 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324153023/http://www.geoexpro.com/articles/2010/02/miri-1910|archive-date=24 March 2015}}</ref>

Finally, on 10 August 1910, the first oil drilling operation was started. A {{convert|30|m|ft|adj=mid|-high}} rig (nicknamed the "Grand Old Lady") made up of wooden derricks and cable tool drilling was used in the operation by Royal Dutch Shell. On 22 December 1910, oil was struck after {{convert|130|m}} of drilling at the well. Royal Dutch Shell also founded a subsidiary company named Sarawak Oil Field Ltd, which now operated as Sarawak Shell Berhad. Since then, another 624 land wells have been drilled around Miri until 1972 which are collectively known as the "Miri field". The Miri field is the only onshore field in Sarawak, because oil production has shifted offshore since the late 1950s. The first oil well on Canada Hill (Miri Well No. 1) produced a total of {{convert|0.65|e6oilbbl}} for the next 60 years until its closure on 31 October 1972.<ref name=AAPG/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Tan|first1=Chin Siang|title=Grand Old Lady of Miri - Where it all began|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19900327&id=JLJUAAAAIBAJ&pg=3112,3325581&hl=en|access-date=21 September 2015|newspaper=New Straits Times|date=27 March 1990}}</ref> The first oil refinery and submarine pipeline was built in Miri in 1914.

Resident Office moved from Marudi to Miri in 1912. Miri grew as fast as the rate of oil production by the Shell company. In 1920, roads were built in Miri. Bicycles and motorcycles were also bought into the town.<ref name=Miribook/> By 1921, there were 40 shop houses in Miri, with one English school and one Chinese school. Motor cars were later introduced to the town. In 1924, Pujut Road was built to link Miri with Lutong. By 1925, rotary drilling was introduced. Oil production continued to increase until it reached a peak of {{convert|15,211|oilbbl}} per day in 1929.

The Brooke government had been actively lobbying for the British government to accept Sarawak as one of its protectorates in an event of a war. By 1888, the British finally agreed to grant the protection to Sarawak. The British dispatched several troops to Sarawak to strengthen its defences in the 1930s. By 1938, under the leadership of Rajah [[Charles Vyner Brooke]], airstrips were constructed in Miri, Kuching, [[Oya, Sarawak|Oya]], and [[Mukah]] in preparation for an imminent war. However, by 1941, British [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] had withdrawn from Sarawak and returned to Singapore. Therefore, the British government advocated a "[[scorched earth]] policy" for the Brooke government in the event of a Japanese attack. A Denial Scheme was formulated to destroy oil installations in Miri and Lutong. This was because the coastline measuring {{convert|30|mi|km|order=flip}} from Lutong to Miri was impossible to defend from Japanese landings due to shortage of manpower. By May 1941, 1 Infantry Company from 2/15 [[15th Punjab Regiment|Punjab Regiment]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/17000/LABUAN%20WAR%20CEMETERY|title=Labuan War Cemetery|publisher=[[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]]|access-date=17 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517030108/http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/17000/LABUAN%20WAR%20CEMETERY|archive-date=17 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> 6-inch Hong Kong-Singapore Royal Artillery Battery, and 1 Platoon of Royal Engineers were stationed at Miri to oversee the destruction of the Miri oil fields.

Soon after the news of Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], Japanese planes were seen making reconnaissance flights over Miri.<ref name=Miriwar/> The Brooke government decided on a complete destruction of oilfields and airfields in Miri. Shell company officials received orders to carry out the Denial Scheme on 8 December 1941. In the evening on the same day, the task was completed.<ref name=Klemen/> All producing oil wells were sealed up with vital equipment and machinery dismantled and shipped off to Singapore. Skilled workers and important company papers also went along with the equipment and sent to Singapore.<ref name=Miriwar/> The Punjab Regiment and several officials were sent to guard Kuching.<ref name=Klemen/> On 16 December 1941, 9 days after the Pearl Harbor bombing, Japanese troops consisting of 10,000 men landed on Tanjung Lobang Beach, Miri without much resistance.<ref name=Klemen/> However, on 17 December 1941, a Dutch [[flying boat]] from [[Tarakan Island]] attacked the Japanese destroyer [[Japanese destroyer Shinonome (1927)|''Shinonome'']] (under the command of Hiroshi Sasagawa) off Miri. The ship was sunk along with the entire crew of 228.<ref>{{cite web |last=Visser |first=Jan |url=https://warfare.gq/dutcheastindies/shinonome.html |title=Who sank IJN destroyer Shinonome, December 1941? |date=1999–2000 |work=Forgotten Campaign: The Dutch East Indies Campaign 1941-1942 |access-date=30 March 2021 |archive-date=27 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230527015737/https://warfare.gq/dutcheastindies/shinonome.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another flying boat X-33 also damaged a Japanese transport ship.<ref name=Klemen/> After the fall of Singapore on 15 January 1942, skilled workers that went into hiding with their equipment were sent back to Miri by the Japanese. They were immediately put to work for Japanese oil supply service company named Nen Ryo Hai Kyu. Much of the Japanese oil drilling and refinery equipment was portable. A total of {{convert|0.75|e6oilbbl}} were produced during the Japanese occupation from 1941 to 1945.<ref name=Miriwar>{{cite web|title=Decline and War|url=http://www.miriresortcity.com/content/decline-war|website=MiriResortCity.com|access-date=28 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319000343/http://www.miriresortcity.com/declineandwar|archive-date=19 March 2015}}</ref>

During the occupation, Miri and Lutong became a periodic subject of Allied air raids and bombings. Food, clothes, and medicine were scarce. Workers of the Japanese oil supply service were used to reconstruct and maintain Lutong Bridge and Lutong airstrip from Allied bombing damage.<ref name=Miriwar/>

===Recent developments===
[[File:Miri town in 1983.jpg|right|thumbnail|Miri town in 1983]]
[[Petronas]], a Malaysian national oil and gas company, was formed in 1974. As a result, a concession system was changed into [[Production sharing agreement|production sharing contract system]] (PSC) between Shell and Petronas. All the foreign oil companies including Shell required to obtain licenses from Petronas. The first two PSCs were signed on 30 November 1976. Foreign oil companies are required to keep not more than 41% of the oil produced until their original costs are recovered. After a return of their investments, the oil companies will keep 30% of the revenue after all operating costs and oil royalties are deducted.<ref>{{cite news|title=Where it all started - The site: Miri in Sarawak|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1309&dat=19810418&id=K2NPAAAAIBAJ&pg=7005,3765941&hl=en|access-date=21 September 2015|publisher=New Sunday Times|date=18 April 1981|quote=The conditions set by Petronas were that the contractors (i.e. the oil companies) could keep as much as, but not more than 41 percent of the oil produced to cover original costs, and give a return of their investment until the costs were finally covered.

Miri Municipal Council has adopted the seahorse as the town's official symbol. It was proposed by the former Sarawak chief minister Abdul Taib Mahmud and introduced as part of the "I love Miri campaign" in 1994. The seahorse is chosen because of its distinctive figure with gentle and graceful motion. These characteristics describe multiple ethnic and cultural identities of Miri which live in peace and harmony with good values of life. It also denotes the location of Miri town near to the sea and coral reefs and the city status as a resort paradise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Miri Macot&mdash;Sea Horse|url=http://tanchinkian.blogspot.com/2011/09/blog-post_05.html|publisher=Tan Chin Kian|access-date=16 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416121950/http://tanchinkian.blogspot.com/2011/09/blog-post_05.html|archive-date=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Pan|first1=Ivy|last2=Goh|first2=SC|title=Borneo Talk Highlight - Miri ecotourism|date=2010|volume=17|page=4|url=http://www.borneotalk.com/vol17/vol17.pdf|access-date=16 April 2015|publisher=Bumi Serasi|quote=The seahorse is the city’s mascot, gentle and graceful in motion, which aptly describes the multi ethnic and culture people living here, all with a smile for visitors who come here.|archive-date=24 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624123858/http://borneotalk.com/vol17/vol17.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Languages===
There is great diversity in terms of languages spoken in Miri, as it is a location where there are migrants from all over Sarawak, some West Malaysians, several foreigners, and several Eurasians. Among the main languages spoken here are Malay: which includes both the local variety of Malay, [[Sarawak Malay|Sarawakian Malay]] or Bahasa Sarawak, and Standard Malay; [[Malaysian Mandarin]], and Iban. The pronunciation and accent of spoken Malay differs depending on each individual's native language, background and history. English is generally well spoken by the older generation, many of whom received primary and secondary education in the 1960s, which then, was in English: a token of British colonialism; or who have worked in oil & gas related companies that operate in English, where they picked up English, Malay and Iban to varying levels of mastery. This is not the case for many younger Mirians, who generally were and are being educated in either Malay or Mandarin; most are capable of speaking basic English with grammar that is heavily influenced by either Malay or Mandarin. This, is because the English language was reduced to a mere standalone subject after the 1980s. There is currently a minuscule minority of Miri-born Millennials and Generation Z members that speaks English as its first language, with varying levels of proficiency. The indigenous races speak their various languages as well, all of them Austronesian. These include languages such as [[Berawan language|Berawan]], Lakiput (often called Kiput), [[Brunei Malay|Bruneian/Kedayan]], Miriek, [[Iban language|Iban]], [[Bidayuh languages|Bidayuh]], [[Kayan languages|Kayan]], [[Kenyah language|Kenyah]], [[Lun Bawang language|Lun Bawang]] and [[Kelabit language|Kelabit]]. Meanwhile, the Chinese Malaysians speak [[Malaysian Mandarin]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Cantonese]], [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Hainanese]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Information from the visitors' Guide to Miri|url=http://www.miriresortcity.com/visitorsguide|website=MiriResortCity.com|access-date=4 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318161203/http://www.miriresortcity.com/visitorsguide|archive-date=18 March 2015}}</ref> [[Hokkien]] and [[Fuzhou dialect|Foochow]], in addition to possibly [[Henghua]], a minority Chinese language in Malaysia.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sman|first1=Cecilia B|title=Foochow gathering a shot in the arm for Miri|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2010/11/18/%E2%80%98foochow-gathering-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-miri%E2%80%99/|access-date=17 May 2015|newspaper=The Borneo Post|date=18 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517155528/http://www.theborneopost.com/2010/11/18/%E2%80%98foochow-gathering-a-shot-in-the-arm-for-miri%E2%80%99/|archive-date=17 May 2015}}</ref> However, many Millennials and Generation Z members in Miri tend to use the lingua francas Malay and Malaysian Mandarin rather than their indigenous languages (such as Kayan and Kelabit) and Chinese dialects (Hokkien and Foochow); with the exception of Iban, which is widely used here; although certain efforts have been made in the past to promote the usage of indigenous languages among the younger generation.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Subhasish|first1=Dasgupta|title=Social Computing: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications|date=30 November 2009|publisher=Idea Group Inc|pages=714–715|isbn=9781605669854|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dLRK_Ep_uc8C&q=Miri+Sarawak+younger+generation+language&pg=PA714|access-date=17 May 2015|quote=A recent example of this is an Internet forum to revive the use of the Kelabit language among the younger generation...As a network conducted on the Internet, the discussion list includes Kelabit who are living in Miri, Kuala Lumpur,...}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Francis|first1=Mary|title=Nanta: Iban a language for learning|url=http://www.theborneopost.com/2014/03/01/nanta-iban-a-language-for-learning/|access-date=17 May 2015|newspaper=The Borneo Post|date=1 March 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150517164143/http://www.theborneopost.com/2014/03/01/nanta-iban-a-language-for-learning/|archive-date=17 May 2015}}</ref>
