'''Caaguazú''' ({{IPA|es|ka(a)ɣwaˈsu}}) is a [[Department (subnational entity)|department]] in [[Paraguay]]. The capital is the city of [[Coronel Oviedo]].

== History ==
[[Image:Nueva Londres.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the city of Nueva Londres]]
In the 16th and 17th centuries, European settlers in the present-day department of [[Caaguazú District|Caaguazú]] were threatened by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[Bandeirante people|Bandeirant]] and [[Guaicurú Indians]], preventing permanent settlement of the land for many years.

In the 18th century, repopulation of Caaguazu began again.  In 1712, Gregorio Bazán de Pedraza founded the [[Curuguaty|Villa de San Isidro Labrador de Curuguaty]], followed by [[Ybytimí]] in 1715, [[San Joaquin District|San Joaquín]] in 1746, and [[Carayaó]] in 1770.

In 1906, the area was assigned the name [[Yhú]], including the departmental capital of Yhú, [[Coronel Oviedo|Ajos (present day Coronel Oviedo)]], [[Carayaó]], San Joaquín and [[Caaguazú District|Caaguazú]]. Upon territorial reorganization in 1945, it was given the name of Caaguazú.

In 1973, the present-day territory and limits of this department were defined.

Caaguazú is the home department of several Paraguayan personalities, such as the writer [[Mario Halley Mora]] and the musician [[Cayo Sila Godoy]].

The name "Caaguazú" (Ka'aguazu in Guaraní) means "great herb."

==Limits==

==Orography and Soil ==
[[Image:Iglesia de Cnel Oviedo.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The Church of Coronel Oviedo]]
The '''Cordillera de Caaguazú '''extends throughout the department from north to south. It is made up of the mountain ranges of San Joaquín, in San Joaquín and Yhú; Tajao Paú and Carayaó; and Caaguazú, between [[Carayaó]] and [[Coronel Oviedo]]. Peak heights are no more than 200 meters, but to the east elevations reach 250 meters.

To the west there are formations of fluvial and glacial origins that date from the Carboniferous period ([[Paleozoic era]]), with sandstone soils. To the east, the soil is also of fluvial origin, lacustrine and marine, dating to the Permian period. In the mountain range, there is sandstone from the Triassic period which contains quartz.

The soils are sandstone and [[basalt]] in addition to mountains and meadows.

The territory is made up of a succession of valleys and elevated lands that range from the north to the south. In the north, there are valleys with ample fields apt for cattle; to the east, forests and natural herbal lands predominate.

The land is commonly used for agriculture.

==Hydrography ==

The most important bodies of water that cross the department are the [[Paraguay River]], the Tebicuary-mi River, and the streams Tapiracuai, Mbutuy, Hondo and Tobatiry. Other local rivers include the [[Paraná River]] and the Acaray, Monday-mi, Yguazú, Capiibary and Guyraungua.

==Natural Environment and Vegetation==

The Caaguazú department includes the Central Forest region, in the middle of the department, the Alto Paraná, in the east, and the Central Littoral, in the west.

The principal activity of the region is the harvesting of trees, which provides the raw material for the wood industry. Caaguzú is one of the areas that is most affected by [[deforestation]] in Paraguay. Some plant species in danger of extinction are the yvyra paje, nandyta, cedar and tumera aureli. Endangered animal species include the tirica, jaguareté, and arira’y.
