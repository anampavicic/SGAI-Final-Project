'''Kasaï-Oriental''' (French for "East Kasai") is one of the 21 [[provinces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo]] created in the [[Subdivisions of the DR Congo#New provinces|2015 repartitioning]]. Kasaï-Oriental, [[Lomami Province|Lomami]], and [[Sankuru]] provinces are the result of the dismemberment of the [[Kasai-Oriental (former province)|former Kasaï-Oriental]] province.<ref>{{cite news |title=RDC : le Kasaï-Oriental éclate en trois nouvelles provinces |url=https://www.radiookapi.net/actualite/2015/07/16/rdc-le-kasai-oriental-eclate-en-trois-nouvelles-provinces |access-date=3 June 2020 |work=[[Radio Okapi]] |date=16 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150718060551/http://radiookapi.net/actualite/2015/07/16/rdc-le-kasai-oriental-eclate-en-trois-nouvelles-provinces/ |archive-date=18 July 2015 |url-status=live |language=fr}}</ref>  Kasaï-Oriental was formed from the [[Tshilenge District|Tshilenge district]] and the independently administered city of [[Mbuji-Mayi]] which retained its status as a provincial capital.

The new province's territory corresponds to most of the historic [[Sud-Kasaï]] province which existed in the early period after [[History of the Democratic Republic of the Congo#Independence and the Congo Crisis (1960–65)|independence]] between 1963 and 1966.

==History==
Kasai-Oriental is inhabited by members of the [[Luba people|Luba]] tribe.

Congo obtained independence from [[Belgium]] in 1960. Friction with Congo's other ethnic groups and encouragement by [[Belgium|Belgian]] corporations hoping to keep their mining concessions led to the secession of the province of [[South Kasai]] as a separate state headed by [[Albert Kalonji]].

After being repulsed, the Congo occupied the province in September 1961. Several thousand people were killed during the "pacification" of South Kasai, which lasted through the spring of 1962.

The population of [[Mbuji-Mayi]] grew rapidly with the immigration of Luba people from other parts of the country.

==Diamond mining==
The region in which Mbuji-Mayi is situated annually produces one-tenth in weight of the world's industrial diamonds, with mining managed by the Société Minière de Bakwanga. This is the largest accumulation of diamonds in the world, more concentrated than those at [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]], [[South Africa]]. Mbuji-Mayi handles most of the industrial diamonds produced in the Congo.

==Political divisions==
The province consists of the following five territories:
* [[Kabeya-Kamwanga Territory|Kabeya-Kamwanga]]
* [[Katanda Territory|Katanda]]
* [[Lupatapata Territory|Lupatapata]]
* [[Miabi Territory|Miabi]]
* [[Tshilenge Territory|Tshilenge]]

==Languages==
[[French language|French]] is the official language. [[Tshiluba]] is one of the four national languages of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Tshiluba is spoken by about 6.3 million people in the Kasai-Oriental, [[Kasai-Occidental]] and [[Kasaï-Central]] provinces.
