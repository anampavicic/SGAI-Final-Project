Minnesota, which gets its name from the [[Dakota language]], has been inhabited by various [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] since the [[Woodland period]] of the 11th century BCE. Between roughly 200 and 500 CE, two areas of the indigenous [[Hopewell tradition]] emerged: the [[Laurel complex]] in the north, and Trempealeau Hopewell in the [[Mississippi River Valley]] in the south. The [[Upper Mississippian|Upper Mississippian culture]], consisting of the [[Oneota]] people and other [[Siouan]] speakers, emerged around 1000 CE and lasted through the arrival of Europeans in the 17th century. French explorers and [[missionaries]] were the earliest Europeans to enter the region, encountering the [[Dakota people|Dakota]], [[Ojibwe]], and various [[Anishinaabe]] tribes. Much of what is now Minnesota formed part of the [[Louisiana Territory|vast French holding of Louisiana]], which [[Louisiana Purchase|the United States purchased]] in 1803. After several territorial reorganizations, the [[Minnesota Territory]] was [[Admission to the Union|admitted to the Union]] as the 32nd state in 1858. Minnesota's official motto, {{lang|fr|L'Étoile du Nord}} ("The Star of the North") is the only [[List of U.S. state and territory mottos|state motto]] in [[French language|French]].<ref name="auto1"/> This phrase was adopted shortly after statehood and reflects both the state's early French explorers and its position as the northernmost state in the contiguous U.S.

As part of the [[American frontier]], Minnesota attracted settlers and [[Homestead Acts|homesteaders]] from across the country. Its growth was initially based on timber, agriculture, and railroad construction. Into the early 20th century, European immigrants arrived in significant numbers, particularly from [[Scandinavia]], Germany, and [[Central Europe]]. Many were linked to the failed [[revolutions of 1848]], which partly influenced the state's development as a center of [[American labor movement|labor and social activism]].<ref name="The transition of a new world Bohemia.">{{cite web|last1=Jerabek|first1=Esther|title=The transition of a new world Bohemia.|url=http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/15/v15i01p026-042.pdf|access-date=May 10, 2020|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|archive-date=February 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224051452/http://collections.mnhs.org/MNHistoryMagazine/articles/15/v15i01p026-042.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Minnesota's rapid industrialization and urbanization precipitated [[Progressive Era|major social, economic, and political changes]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; the state was at the forefront of [[Labor rights in the United States|labor rights]], [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage]], and political reform.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Backerud |first=Thomas K. |date=August 26, 2014 |title=What it meant to be 'progressive' in turn-of-the-century Minnesota |url=https://www.minnpost.com/mnopedia/2014/08/what-it-meant-be-progressive-turn-century-minnesota/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210624202657/https://www.minnpost.com/mnopedia/2014/08/what-it-meant-be-progressive-turn-century-minnesota/ |archive-date=June 24, 2021 |access-date=June 22, 2021 |website=MinnPost |language=en-US}}</ref> Consequently, Minnesota is relatively unique among Midwestern states in being a reliable base for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], having voted for every Democratic presidential nominee since 1976, longer than any other U.S. state.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ostermeier |first=Eric |date=September 3, 2015 |title=Republicans and Democrats Have Record Presidential Winning Streaks in 36 States |url=https://smartpolitics.lib.umn.edu/2015/09/03/republicans-and-democrats-have-record-presidential-winning-streaks-in-36-states/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201111190857/https://smartpolitics.lib.umn.edu/2015/09/03/republicans-and-democrats-have-record-presidential-winning-streaks-in-36-states/ |archive-date=November 11, 2020 |access-date=June 18, 2022 |website=Smart Politics |language=en-US}}</ref>

Since the late 20th century, Minnesota's economy has diversified away from traditional industries such as agriculture and resource extraction to services, finance, and health care. Minnesota is home to 11 federally recognized [[Indian reservation|Native American reservations]] (seven Ojibwe, four Dakota), and its culture, demographics, and religious landscape reflect [[Scandinavian American|Scandinavian]] and [[German Americans|German]] influence.

[[File:Minnesota Territory 1849.svg|thumb|A map of [[Minnesota Territory]] 1849–1858]]
When Europeans arrived in North America, the [[Dakota people]] lived in what is now Minnesota. The first Europeans to enter the region were French [[voyageurs]], [[fur trade]]rs who arrived in the 17th century. They used the [[Grand Portage National Monument|Grand Portage]] to access trapping and trading areas further into Minnesota. The [[Anishinaabe]] (also known as [[Ojibwe]] or Chippewa) were migrating into Minnesota, causing tensions with the Dakota people,<ref name="timepieces">{{cite web | title = TimePieces | url = http://events.mnhs.org/TimePieces/timeline.cfm | publisher = Minnesota Historical Society | access-date = September 19, 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060917211935/http://events.mnhs.org/TimePieces/timeline.cfm | archive-date = September 17, 2006 | df = mdy-all }}</ref> and dislocated the [[Mdewakanton]] from their homelands along [[Mille Lacs Lake]]. Explorers such as [[Daniel Greysolon, Sieur du Lhut]], Father [[Louis Hennepin]], [[Jonathan Carver]], [[Henry Schoolcraft]], and [[Joseph Nicollet]] mapped the state.

The region was part of [[Louisiana (New Spain)|Spanish Louisiana]] from 1762 to 1802.<ref>{{cite web |title=Louisiana Purchase – History, Facts, & Map |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349302/Louisiana-Purchase |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501010249/https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349302/Louisiana-Purchase |archive-date=May 1, 2015 |access-date=December 31, 2014 |website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Chamberlain |first1=Charles |last2=Faber |first2=Lo |title=Spanish Colonial Louisiana |url=http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/spanish-colonial-louisiana |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180219090342/http://www.knowlouisiana.org/entry/spanish-colonial-louisiana |archive-date=February 19, 2018 |access-date=February 18, 2018 |website=Know Louisiana}}</ref> The portion of the state east of the Mississippi River became part of the United States at the end of the [[American Revolutionary War]], when the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Second Treaty of Paris]] was signed.

In 1805, [[Zebulon Pike]] bargained with Native Americans to acquire land at the [[confluence]] of the Minnesota and Mississippi rivers to create a military reservation.

Minnesota was part of several territorial organizations between acquisition and statehood. From 1812 to 1821 it was part of the [[Territory of Missouri]] that corresponded with much of the Louisiana Purchase. It was briefly an unorganized territory ([[Territories of the United States#Formerly unorganized territories|1821–1834]]) and was later consolidated with Wisconsin, Iowa and half the Dakotas to form the short-lived [[Territory of Michigan]] (1834–1836).

In early 1863, Ramsey resigned as governor to become the Federal [[Indian Commissioner]]. His successor, Governor [[Henry Adoniram Swift|Henry Swift]], raised the bounty to $200/scalp. A total of $325 was paid out to four people collecting bounties, including for Little Crow who was killed in July 1863.<ref name="Bounty" /> Upon becoming Indian Commissioner, Ramsey set out to get Ojibwe lands too. In 1863 he negotiated the [[Treaty of Old Crossing]], whereby the Ojibwe ceded all their land in northern Minnesota and moved to reservations.

Logging, farming, and railroads were mainstays of Minnesota's early economy. The sawmills at Saint Anthony Falls and logging centers of [[Pine City, Minnesota|Pine City]], [[Marine on St. Croix, Minnesota|Marine on St. Croix]], [[Stillwater, Minnesota|Stillwater]], and [[Winona, Minnesota|Winona]] processed vast quantities of timber. These cities were on rivers that were ideal for transportation.<ref name="Lass" /> St. Anthony Falls was later tapped to provide power for flour mills.

The state's iron-mining industry was established with the discovery of iron in the [[Vermilion Range (Minnesota)|Vermilion]] and [[Mesabi Range|Mesabi]] ranges in the 1880s, followed by the [[Cuyuna Range]] in the early 1900s. The ore went by rail to [[Duluth, Minnesota|Duluth]] and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]] for ship transport east via the [[Great Lakes]].<ref name="Lass" />

Industrial development and the rise of manufacturing caused the population to shift gradually from rural areas to cities during the early 20th century. Nevertheless, farming remained prevalent. Minnesota's economy was hit hard by the [[Great Depression]], resulting in lower prices for farmers, layoffs among iron miners, and labor unrest. Compounding the adversity, western Minnesota and the Dakotas were hit by drought from 1931 to 1935. [[New Deal]] programs provided some economic turnaround. The [[Civilian Conservation Corps]] and other programs around the state established some jobs for Indians on their reservations, and the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] of 1934 provided the tribes with a mechanism of self-government. This gave Natives a greater voice within the state and promoted more respect for tribal customs because religious ceremonies and [[native language]]s were no longer suppressed.<ref name="Gilman" />

After World War II, industrial development quickened. New technology increased farm productivity through automation of [[feedlot]]s for hogs and cattle, machine milking at dairy farms, and raising chickens in large buildings. Planting became more specialized, with [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] of corn and wheat, and farm machinery such as [[tractor]]s and [[combine harvester|combines]] became the norm. [[University of Minnesota]] professor [[Norman Borlaug]] contributed to these developments as part of the [[Green Revolution]].<ref name="Gilman" /> Increased mobility enabled more specialized jobs.<ref name="Gilman" /> 

Minnesota became a center of technology after World War II. [[Engineering Research Associates]] was formed in 1946 to develop computers for the [[United States Navy]]. It later merged with [[Remington Rand]], and then became [[Sperry Rand]]. [[William Norris (CEO)|William Norris]] left Sperry in 1957 to form [[Control Data Corporation]] (CDC).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hagley.lib.de.us/2015.htm |title=Engineering Research Associates Records 1946–1959 |publisher=Hagley Museum and Library |access-date=November 26, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060622021939/http://www.hagley.lib.de.us/2015.htm |archive-date=June 22, 2006 }}</ref> [[Cray]] Research was formed when [[Seymour Cray]] left CDC to form his own company.

Minnesota has been affected by climate change and warmed over the past few years. Rising temperatures have affected natural habitats and many species that live in them. For example, the lakes' water is warming, which affects fish populations: trout, a cold-water fish, is losing its habitat, while the habitat of bass, a warm-water fish, is growing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-09/documents/climate-change-mn.pdf|title=What Climate Change Means For Minnesota}}</ref>

Minnesota's religious landscape is also diverse, having evolved significantly over its history. The area's first Christian influence came from Catholic missionaries in the 17th and 18th centuries. 19th-century European settlers, especially Scandinavians, established Protestant denominations, particularly [[Lutheranism]]. [[Catholicism]] also continued to be significant due to Irish immigrants, and the [[Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis]] serves a substantial Catholic community. The 20th and 21st centuries witnessed growth in other Christian denominations and non-Christian religions due to further immigration, leading to the establishment of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Miao folk religion|Hmong folk religion]], [[Islam|Muslim]], and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] communities, as well as a sizable [[Judaism|Jewish]] community.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salatomatic.com/c/Minneapolis-St-Paul+42|title=Mosques and Islamic schools in Minneapolis–St. Paul, Minnesota – salatomatic.com: your guide to mosques & Islamic schools|access-date=October 28, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140528005623/http://www.salatomatic.com/c/Minneapolis-St-Paul+42|archive-date=May 28, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="autogenerated2">{{cite book| last =Gilman| first =Rhonda R.| title =The Story of Minnesota's Past| publisher =Minnesota Historical Society Press| year =1989| location =Saint Paul, Minnesota| page =99| isbn =978-0-87351-267-1}}</ref> A growing number of people identify as [[Irreligion|non-religious]], in line with national trends.

=== Literature ===

The rigors and rewards of pioneer life on the [[prairie]] are the subject of [[Giants in the Earth (novel)|''Giants in the Earth'']] by [[Ole Rolvaag]] and the [[Little House on the Prairie|''Little House'']] series of children's books by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]]. Small-town life is portrayed grimly by [[Sinclair Lewis]] in the novel [[Main Street (novel)|''Main Street'']], and more gently and affectionately by [[Garrison Keillor]] in his tales of [[Lake Wobegon]]. St. Paul native [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]] writes of the social insecurities and aspirations of the young city in stories such as ''[[Winter Dreams]]'' and ''The Ice Palace'' (published in ''[[Flappers and Philosophers]]''). [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]]'s epic poem ''[[The Song of Hiawatha]]'' was inspired by Minnesota and names of many of the state's places and bodies of water. Minnesota native Robert Zimmerman ([[Bob Dylan]]) won the 2016 [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Science fiction writer [[Marissa Lingen]] lives here.

Transportation in Minnesota is overseen by the [[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] (MnDOT) at the state level and by regional and local governments at the local level. Principal transportation corridors radiate from the [[Twin Cities]] metropolitan area and along interstate corridors in Greater Minnesota. The major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]] are [[Interstate 35 in Minnesota|Interstate{{spaces}}35]] (I-35), [[Interstate 90 in Minnesota|I-90]], and [[Interstate 94 in Minnesota|I-94]], with I-35 and I-94 connecting the Minneapolis–St. Paul area, and I-90 traveling east–west along the southern edge of the state.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] |title=2007–2008 Official Highway Map |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/statemap/pdf/MNmap.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=April 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408220510/http://www.dot.state.mn.us/statemap/pdf/MNmap.pdf |archive-date=April 8, 2008 }}</ref> In 2006, a [[constitutional amendment]] was passed that required sales and use taxes on motor vehicles to fund transportation, with at least 40% dedicated to [[public transit]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Transportation amendment update| publisher = Minnesota Department of Transportation| year = 2006| url = http://www.dot.state.mn.us/information/mvst/index.html| access-date = April 7, 2008|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080626041042/http://www.dot.state.mn.us/information/mvst/index.html |archive-date = June 26, 2008}}</ref> There are nearly two dozen [[rail transport|rail]] corridors in Minnesota, most of which go through Minneapolis–St. Paul or Duluth.<ref>{{cite map|publisher=[[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] |title=Minnesota Rail System |year=2007 |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/ofrw/maps/RailLines20070806_1.pdf |format=PDF |access-date=April 7, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080408220542/http://www.dot.state.mn.us/ofrw/maps/RailLines20070806_1.pdf |archive-date=April 8, 2008 }}</ref> There is water transportation along the [[Mississippi River]] system and from the ports of [[Lake Superior]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Minnesota Ports and Waterways |publisher=[[Minnesota Department of Transportation]] |url=http://www.dot.state.mn.us/ofrw/waterways.html |access-date=April 7, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317123114/http://www.dot.state.mn.us/ofrw/waterways.html |archive-date=March 17, 2008 }}</ref>

The executive branch is led by Minnesota's [[Governor (United States)|governor]], currently [[Tim Walz]], a [[Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party|DFLer]] who took office on January 7, 2019. Walz is also [[Kamala Harris]]'s running mate in the [[2024 United States presidential election]]. As chief executive, the [[Governor of Minnesota|governor]] appoints the heads of state agencies and is responsible for faithful execution of the law.

=== Legislature ===

{{Main|Minnesota Legislature}}
[[File:Minnesota State Capitol.jpg|thumb|The [[Minnesota State Capitol]] in Saint Paul, designed by [[Cass Gilbert]]]]

The [[Minnesota Legislature]] is a [[bicameral]] body consisting of the [[Minnesota Senate|Senate]] and the [[Minnesota House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The state has 67 districts, each with about 60,000 people. Each district has one senator and two representatives, each senatorial district being divided into ''A'' and ''B'' sections for members of the House. Senators serve for four years and representatives for two years.

Since 2023, both the House and Senate have had a slim DFL majority.<ref name="Faircloth 2022">{{cite web | last=Faircloth | first=Ryan | title=Democrats take control of the Minnesota Legislature | website=Star Tribune | date=November 7, 2022 | url=https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-legislature-control-republicans-senate-democrats-house-election-results-2022/600222707/ | access-date=January 26, 2023 | archive-date=January 26, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230126222201/https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-legislature-control-republicans-senate-democrats-house-election-results-2022/600222707/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Judiciary ===

Minnesota's court system has three levels. Most cases start in the [[Minnesota District Courts|district courts]], which are courts of general jurisdiction. There are 279 district court judgeships in ten judicial districts. Appeals from the trial courts and challenges to certain governmental decisions are heard by the [[Minnesota Court of Appeals]], consisting of 19 judges who typically sit in three-judge panels. The seven-justice [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] hears all appeals from the tax court, the [[Minnesota Workers' Compensation Court of Appeals|workers' compensation court of appeals]], first-degree murder convictions, and [[Certiorari#State courts|discretionary appeals]] from the court of appeals; it also has [[original jurisdiction]] over election disputes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minnesota Supreme Court |publisher=Court Information Office, State of Minnesota |url=http://www.courts.state.mn.us/documents/CIO/otherResources/SupremeCourt.doc |format=doc |access-date=October 19, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061101095530/https://www.courts.state.mn.us/documents/CIO/otherResources/SupremeCourt.doc |archive-date=November 1, 2006 }}</ref>

Two specialized courts within administrative agencies have been established: the workers' compensation court of appeals, and the tax court, which deals with non-criminal tax cases.

=== Regional ===

In addition to the city and county levels of government found in the United States, Minnesota has other entities that provide governmental oversight and planning. [[Regional Development Commissions|Regional development commissions]] (RDCs) provide technical assistance to local governments in the broad multi-county areas of the state. Along with this [[Metropolitan Planning Organizations]] (MPOs), such as the [[Metropolitan Council (Minnesota)|Metropolitan Council]], provide planning and oversight of land use actions in metropolitan areas. Many lakes and rivers are overseen by [[Watershed district (Minnesota)|watershed districts]] and [[soil and water conservation district]]s.

=== Federal ===

Minnesota's [[United States senator]]s are Democrats [[Amy Klobuchar]] and [[Tina Smith]]. The state has eight [[Minnesota Congressional Districts|congressional districts]]; they are represented by [[Brad Finstad]] ([[Minnesota's 1st congressional district|1st district]]; R), [[Angie Craig]] ([[Minnesota's 2nd congressional district|2nd]]; DFL), [[Dean Phillips]] ([[Minnesota's 3rd congressional district|3rd]]; DFL), [[Betty McCollum]] ([[Minnesota's 4th congressional district|4th]]; DFL), [[Ilhan Omar]] ([[Minnesota's 5th congressional district|5th]]; DFL), [[Tom Emmer]] ([[Minnesota's 6th congressional district|6th]]; R), [[Michelle Fischbach]] ([[Minnesota's 7th congressional district|7th]]; R), and [[Pete Stauber]] ([[Minnesota's 8th congressional district|8th]]; R).

Federal court cases are heard in the [[United States District Court for the District of Minnesota]], in Minneapolis, St. Paul, Duluth, and [[Fergus Falls]]. Appeals are heard by the [[Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]] and St. Paul.

=== Tribal ===

The State of Minnesota was created by the United States federal government in the traditional and cultural range of lands occupied by the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] and [[Anishinaabe]] peoples as well as other Native American groups. After many years of unequal treaties and forced resettlement by the state and federal government, the tribes re-organized into sovereign tribal governments. Today, the tribal governments are divided into 11 semi-autonomous [[Indian reservation|reservations]] that negotiate with the U.S. and the state on a bilateral basis:

Four Dakota [[Mdewakanton]] communities:
* [[Prairie Island Indian Community]]
* [[Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community]]
* [[Lower Sioux Indian Reservation]]
* [[Upper Sioux Community, Minnesota|Upper Sioux Community{{snd}}Pejuhutazizi Oyate]]

Seven Anishinaabe reservations:
* [[Bois Forte Band of Chippewa]]
* [[Fond du Lac Band of Lake Superior Chippewa]]
* [[Grand Portage Band of Chippewa]]
* [[Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe]]
* [[Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe]]
* [[White Earth Band of Ojibwe]]
* [[Red Lake Band of Chippewa]]

The first six of the Anishinaabe bands compose the [[Minnesota Chippewa Tribe]], the collective federally recognized tribal government of the Bois Forte, Fond du Lac, Grand Portage, Leech Lake, Mille Lacs, and White Earth reservations.

[[Hubert Humphrey]] brought national attention to the state with his address at the [[1948 Democratic National Convention]]. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for [[Ronald Reagan]] in either of his presidential campaigns. Minnesota has voted for the Democratic nominee in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when the state was won by Republican [[Richard Nixon]].

Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level Democratic party has a different name, officially known as the [[Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party]] (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and [[Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party|Farmer–Labor]] parties.

The state has had active third-party movements. The [[Reform Party of the United States|Reform Party]], now the [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]], was able to elect former mayor of [[Brooklyn Park, Minnesota|Brooklyn Park]] and [[professional wrestler]] [[Jesse Ventura]] to the [[Minnesota gubernatorial election, 1998|governorship in 1998]]. The [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]] has received enough support to keep major-party status. The [[Green Party of Minnesota|Green Party]], while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government,<ref name="GrnOffHldrs">{{cite web | title = Office Holders | publisher = Green Party of Minnesota | url = http://www.mngreens.org/officeholders.php | access-date = April 18, 2007|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070107163820/http://www.mngreens.org/officeholders.php |archive-date = January 7, 2007}}</ref> notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved for parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., governor, secretary of state, U.S. president).

The state's [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seats was split in the early 1990s and in the [[108th United States Congress|108th]] and [[109th United States Congress|109th]] Congresses, Minnesota's congressional delegation was split, with four representatives and one senator from each party. In the 2006 mid-term election, Democrats were elected to all state offices, except governor and lieutenant governor, where Republicans [[Tim Pawlenty]] and [[Carol Molnau]] narrowly won reelection. The DFL posted double-digit gains in both houses of the legislature, elected Amy Klobuchar to the U.S. Senate, and increased the party's U.S. House caucus by one. Keith Ellison (DFL) was elected as the first [[African American]] U.S. Representative from Minnesota, as well as the first [[Muslim]] elected to Congress nationwide.<ref>{{cite news|title=Minnesota Democrat becomes first Muslim to win seat in Congress |newspaper=International Herald Tribune |agency=Associated Press |date=November 7, 2006 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/08/america/NA_POL_US_Election_Muslim.php |access-date=December 11, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128232133/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2006/11/08/america/NA_POL_US_Election_Muslim.php |archive-date=November 28, 2006 }}</ref> In 2008, DFLer and former comedian and radio talk show host [[Al Franken]] defeated incumbent Republican [[Norm Coleman]] in the U.S. Senate race by 312 votes out of three million cast.

In the 2010 election, Republicans took control of both chambers of the Minnesota legislature for the first time in 38 years and, with Mark Dayton's election, the DFL party took the governor's office for the first time in 20 years. Two years later, the DFL regained control of both houses, and with Dayton in office, the party had same-party control of both the legislative and executive branches for the first time since 1990.

== Sports, recreation and tourism ==

Minnesota has an active program of organized amateur and professional sports. Tourism has become an important industry, especially in the Lake region. In the North Country, what had been an industrial area focused on mining and timber has largely been transformed into a vacation destination. Popular interest in the environment and [[environmentalism]], added to traditional interests in [[hunting]] and fishing, has attracted a large urban audience within driving range.<ref>Aaron Shapiro, ''The Lure of the North Woods: Cultivating Tourism in the Upper Midwest'' (University of Minnesota Press, 2015).</ref>
