'''Uberaba''' ({{IPA|pt|ubeˈɾabɐ}}) is a city in the state of [[Minas Gerais]], [[Brazil]]. It is located in the [[Brazilian Highlands]] at an elevation of 823 metres (2,700 ft) above sea level on the Uberaba River, and is situated 418 kilometres (260 mi) from the state capital, [[Belo Horizonte]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Uberaba {{!}} Brazil {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Uberaba |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240428063018/https://www.britannica.com/place/Minas-Gerais |archive-date=2024-04-28 |access-date=7 March 2022 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> The city was granted its status in 1856 and derives its name from the [[Tupi language]], meaning "bright water".<ref>{{Cite web |last=giftnily.com |date=7 March 2022 |title=There is tupi in Portuguese spoken in Brazil |url=https://www.opovo.com.br/noticias/brasil/2022/03/07/curitiba-ubatuba-pipoca-quotchorar-as-pitangas-quot-o-tupi-presente-no-portugues-falado-no-brasil.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240428062908/https://www.opovo.com.br/noticias/brasil/2022/03/07/curitiba-ubatuba-pipoca-quotchorar-as-pitangas-quot-o-tupi-presente-no-portugues-falado-no-brasil.html |archive-date=2024-04-28 |access-date=7 March 2022 |website=Giftnily |language=en-US}}</ref> As of 2021, the population was 340,277 inhabitants.

==History==
[[File:Rua do comercio 1930.jpg|thumb|Uberaba circa 1930.]]
The history of Uberaba traces its origins back to 1810, when Captain Major Eustaquio founded a settlement near the ancient [[Rodovia Anhanguera|Anhanguera route]], which was more commonly referred to back then as the "Goyazes road". This settlement served as a resting point for both locals and travelers who passed through or arrived there during the 19th century. Its strategic location and function as a crossroads prompted local farmers to engage in crop cultivation and cattle domestication for commercial purposes, leading to the establishment of a robust livestock network in the region.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Urban land: the relationship between religious and public institutions in the control over the land heritage for founding the city of Buritizal / SP |url=https://cadernos.proarq.fau.ufrj.br/public/docs/Proarq18_UrbanLand_IvoneJunior.pdf}}</ref>

Initially a part of the [[Captaincies of Brazil|Captaincy]] of [[Goias]], the territory of Uberaba was incorporated into the Captaincy of Minas Gerais in 1816. It gained recognition as a parish in 1820 and was officially designated as a city in 1856.<ref>{{Cite web |title=IFTM {{!}} Congresso de Internacionalização e Educação Profissional e Tecnológica |url=http://www.iftm.edu.br/coninterept/ |access-date=2022-06-29 |website=www.iftm.edu.br |language=pt-br}}</ref>

In 1889, the inaugural railway station was established due to the expansion of the Mogiana Railway from the neighboring municipality of [[Sacramento, Minas Gerais|Sacramento]]. The introduction of the railway system boosted the economy of Uberaba in the subsequent years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=THE TRAMWAYS OF SACRAMENTO |url=http://tramz.com/br/sa/sa.html |access-date=17 March 2022 |website=tramz.com}}</ref>

Currently, Uberaba is known for its lively livestock and [[agribusiness]] events. As an industrial hub, the city functions as a regional center for culture, commerce, and entertainment, hosting a diverse array of institutions, markets, and entertainment venues.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Santana |first1=M.

The municipality includes the rural district of [[Peirópolis]], known for its paleontological site. This area features the Paleontological Research Center Llewellyn Ivor Price and a museum dedicated to local fossil discoveries.

On March 27, 2024, Uberaba gained recognition from UNESCO as a [[UNESCO Global Geoparks|global geopark]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-01 |title=UNESCO names 18 new Geoparks {{!}} UNESCO |url=https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-names-18-new-geoparks |access-date=2024-04-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240401025255/https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-names-18-new-geoparks |archive-date=1 April 2024 }}</ref>

== Paleontology ==
[[File:Replica de Titanossauro em Peirópolis.jpg|thumb|Replica of a species of titanosaur next to the Dinosaur Museum in [[Peirópolis]].]]
Uberaba is recognized for housing a significant paleontological site in Brazil, boasting fossil records dating back approximately 80 to 66 million years, from the [[Late Cretaceous|Late Cretaceous period]]. 

The first paleontological discoveries in the territory were made by chance in 1945 when workers in the rural district of Peirópolis accidentally came across well-preserved fossils. Subsequently, paleontologist [[Llewellyn Ivor Price]], associated with the [[National Department of Mineral Production]] (DNPM), conducted extensive scientific research in the region from 1947 until 1974, with ''[[Peirosaurus]]'' being one of Price's early findings in the area of the [[Serra da Galga Formation]].<ref name="CCRA09">{{cite journal |last=Candeiro |first=C.

In 1991, it was established in Peirópolis, the Paleontological Research Center Llewellyn Ivor Price, locally known as the Centro de Pesquisas Paleontológicas Llewellyn Ivor Price. Currently, the research center collaborates with various national and international research institutions, and serves as a hub for paleontology in Brazil, focusing on understanding the fossil fauna and environments of the Late Cretaceous in the region, maintaining its own technical team for fossil preservation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Paleophilatelie.eu – Brazil 1995 |url=http://www.paleophilatelie.eu/description/stamps/brazil_1995.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240425203154/https://www.paleophilatelie.eu/description/stamps/brazil_1995.html |archive-date=2024-04-25 |access-date=7 March 2022 |website=www.paleophilatelie.eu}}</ref> As an integral part of the Research Center, The Dinosaur Museum aims to disseminate paleontological knowledge to the general public through interactive and educational exhibitions.
