The city was mostly depopulated by the [[Great Surgun]] of 1603–05, when the [[Safavid Iran|Safavid Empire]] forcibly deported hundreds of thousands of Armenians to Iran. In 1679, the city was mostly destroyed by an [[1679 Armenia earthquake|earthquake]], and then rebuilt on a smaller scale. In 1828, Yerevan became part of the [[Russian Empire]], which led to the repatriation of Armenians whose ancestors had been forcibly relocated in the 17th century. After [[World War I]], Yerevan became the capital of the [[First Republic of Armenia]] as thousands of [[Armenian genocide survivors|survivors]] of the [[Armenian genocide]] in the [[Ottoman Empire]] arrived in the area.<ref>{{cite book | last =Hovannisian | first =Richard G. | title =The Republic of Armenia: The First Year, 1918–1919, Vol. I | publisher = University of California Press | year =1971 | location =Berkeley | isbn=0-520-01984-9 | pages =126–127}}</ref> The city expanded rapidly during the 20th century while [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenia]] was a part of the [[Soviet Union]].

Of the notable landmarks of Yerevan, [[Erebuni Fortress]] is considered to be the birthplace of the city, the [[Katoghike Tsiranavor Church of Avan|Katoghike Tsiranavor]] church is the oldest surviving church of Yerevan, and [[Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral, Yerevan|Saint Gregory Cathedral]] is the largest Armenian cathedral in the world. [[Tsitsernakaberd]] is the official memorial to the victims of the Armenian genocide. The city is home to several opera houses, theatres, museums, libraries, and other cultural institutions. [[Yerevan Opera Theatre]] is the main spectacle hall of the Armenian capital, the [[National Gallery of Armenia]] is the largest art museum in Armenia and shares a building with the [[History Museum of Armenia]], and the [[Matenadaran]] contains one of the largest depositories of ancient books and manuscripts in the world.

Scholar Margarit Israelyan notes these changes when comparing inscriptions found on two [[cuneiform]] tablets at Erebuni:{{quotation|The transcription of the second cuneiform ''bu'' [original emphasis] of the word was very essential in our interpretation as it is the Urartaean ''b'' that has been shifted to the [[Armenian language|Armenian]] ''v'' (b > v).

Ghapantsian justly objected, remarking that the Urartu ''b'' changed to ''v'' at the beginning of the word (Biani > Van) or between two vowels (ebani > avan, Zabaha > [[Javakhk]])....In other words ''b'' was placed between two vowels. The true pronunciation of the fortress-city was apparently ''Erebuny''.<ref>Israelyan (1971), p. 137.</ref>}}

Early Christian Armenian chroniclers connected the origin of the city's name to the legend of [[Noah's Ark]]. After the ark had landed on [[Mount Ararat]] and the flood waters had receded, [[Noah]], while looking in the direction of Yerevan, is said to have exclaimed "Yerevats!"

[[File:Shengavit Settlement 2.jpg|thumb|Foundations of [[Shengavit Settlement|Shengavit historical site]] (site settled 3200 BC cal to 2500 BC cal) ]]
The territory of Yerevan has been inhabited since approximately the 2nd half of the [[4th millennium BC]]. The southern part of the city currently known as [[Shengavit District|Shengavit]] has been populated since at least 3200 BC, during the period of [[Kura–Araxes culture]] of the early [[Bronze Age]]. The first excavations at the [[Shengavit Settlement|Shengavit historical site]] was conducted between 1936 and 1938 under the guidance of archaeologist Yevgeny Bayburdyan. After two decades, archaeologist Sandro Sardarian resumed the excavations starting from 1958 until 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.panarmenian.net/arm/details/118010/|title=Շենգավիթ.

Together they conducted three series of excavations in 2009, 2010, and 2012 respectively.{{cn|date=March 2023}} During the process, a full stratigraphic column to bedrock was reached, showing there to be 8 or 9 distinct stratigraphic levels. These levels cover a time between 3200 BC and 2500 BC. Evidences of later use of the site, possibly until 2200 BC, were also found. The excavation process revealed a series of large round buildings with square adjoining rooms and minor round buildings.

===Median and Achaemenid rules===

[[File:AchaemenidGoblet01.jpg|thumb|upright|Achaemenid [[rhyton]] from Erebuni]]
{{unreferencedsect|date=February 2023}}
In 590 BC, following the fall of the Kingdom of Urartu at the hands of the Iranian [[Medes]], Erebuni along with the Armenian Highlands became part of the Median Empire.

However, in 550 BC, the [[Medes|Median Empire]] was conquered by [[Cyrus the Great]], and Erebuni became part of the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Between 522 BC and 331 BC, Erebuni was one of the main centers of the [[Satrapy of Armenia]], a region controlled by the [[Orontid dynasty]] as one of the [[satrapy|satrapies]] of the Achaemenid Empire. The Satrapy of Armenia was divided into two parts: the northern part and the southern part, with the cities of Erebuni (Yerevan) and Tushpa (Van) as their centres, respectively.

Coins issued in 478 BC, along with many other items found in the [[Erebuni Fortress]], reveal the importance of Erebuni as a major centre for trade under Achaemenid rule.

===Ancient Kingdom of Armenia===
{{see also|Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)}}
{{unreferencedsect|date=February 2023}}
After [[Alexander the Great|Alexander the Great's]] victory over the Achaemenid Empire, the Orontid rulers of the Armenian satrapy achieved independence as a result of the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BC, founding the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]]. With the establishment of new cities such as [[Armavir (ancient city)|Armavir]], Zarehavan, [[Bagaran (ancient city)|Bagaran]] and [[Yervandashat (ancient city)|Yervandashat]], the importance of Erebuni gradually declined.

With the rise of the [[Artaxiad dynasty]] of Armenia who seized power in 189 BC, the Kingdom of Armenia greatly expanded to include major territories of [[Asia Minor]], [[Atropatene]], [[Kingdom of Iberia (antiquity)|Iberia]], [[Phoenicia]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]]. The Artaxiads considered Erebuni and Tushpa as cities of Persian heritage. Consequently, new cities and commercial centres were built by Kings [[Artaxias I]], [[Artavasdes I of Armenia|Artavasdes I]] and [[Tigranes the Great]]. Thus, with the dominance of cities such as [[Artaxata]] and [[Tigranocerta]], Erebuni significantly lost its importance as a central city.
[[File:Sb Astvatsatsin Chapel, Avan, Yerevan1.JPG|thumb|The ruins of the 4th-century Holy Mother of God Chapel in Avan, north of Yerevan]]

Under the rule of the [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia]] (54–428 AD), many other cities around Erebuni including [[Vagharshapat]] and [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] flourished. Consequently, Erebuni was completely neutralized, losing its role as an economic and strategic centre of Armenia. During the period of the Arsacid kings, Erebuni was only recorded in a [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] text of the 3rd century, where it is mentioned that one of the disciples of the prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] founded a [[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] community near the Christian community in Erebuni.

According to the medieval Armenian geography ''[[Ashkharhatsuyts]]'', Erebuni was part of the canton ({{Transliteration|xcl|gawaṙ}}) of Kotayk (not to be confused with the current Kotayk Province) of the province of [[Ayrarat]], within Armenia Major.

Armenia became a Christian nation in the early 4th century AD, during the reign of the Arsacid king [[Tiridates III of Armenia|Tiridates III]].

Following the partition of Armenia by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] empires in 387 and in 428, Erebuni and the entire territory of Eastern Armenia came under the rule of Sasanian Persia.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hacikyan|first=Agop Jack|title=The Heritage of Armenian Literature: From the Oral Tradition to the Golden Age|volume=1|year=2000|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-8143-2815-6|author-link=Agop Jack Hacikyan|author2=Basmajian, Gabriel|author3=Franchuk, Edward S.|author4=Ouzounian, Nourhan|page=[https://archive.org/details/heritageofarmeni00ajha/page/168 168]|url=https://archive.org/details/heritageofarmeni00ajha/page/168}}</ref> The Armenian territories formed the province of [[Persian Armenia]] within the [[Sasanian Empire]].

Due to the diminished role of Erebuni, as well as the absence of proper historical data, much of the city's history under the Sasanian rule is unknown.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

In 587, during the reign of [[Maurice (emperor)|emperor Maurice]], Yerevan and much of Armenia came under Roman administration after the Romans defeated the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanid Persian Empire]] at the [[battle of the Blarathon]].{{cn|date=March 2023}} Soon after, [[Katoghike Tsiranavor Church of Avan|Katoghike Tsiranavor Church]] in [[Avan district|Avan]] was built between 595 and 602. Despite being partly damaged during the [[1679 Armenia earthquake|1679 earthquake]]), it is the oldest surviving church within modern Yerevan city limits.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

The province of Persian Armenia (also known as Persarmenia) lasted until 646, when the province was dissolved with the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]].

In 658 AD, at the height of the Arab Islamic invasions, Erebuni-Yerevan was conquered during the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]], as it was part of Persian-ruled Armenia. The city became part of the [[Arminiya|Emirate of Armenia]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. The city of Dvin was the centre of the newly created emirate. Starting from this period, as a result of the developing trade activities with the Arabs, the Armenian territories had gained strategic importance as a crossroads for the Arab [[Camel train|caravan]] routes passing between Europe and India through the Arab-controlled Ararat Plain of Armenia. Most probably, "Erebuni" has become known as "Yerevan" since at least the 7th century AD.

===Bagratid Armenia===
{{see also|Bagratid Armenia}}
{{unreferencedsect|date=May 2023}}
After two centuries of Islamic rule over Armenia, the [[Bagratuni dynasty|Bagratid]] prince [[Ashot I of Armenia]] led the revolution against the [[Abbasid Caliphate]]. Ashot I liberated Yerevan in 850, and was recognized as the Prince of Princes of Armenia by the Abbasid Caliph [[al-Musta'in]] in 862. Ashot was later crowned King of [[Bagratid Armenia|Armenia]] through the consent of Caliph [[al-Mu'tamid]] in 885. During the rule of the Bagratuni dynasty of Armenia between 885 and 1045, Yerevan was relatively a secure part of the Kingdom before falling to the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]].

However, Yerevan did not have any strategic role during the reign of the Bagratids, who developed many other cities of [[Ayrarat]], such as [[Shirakavan (ancient city)|Shirakavan]], [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]], and [[Ani]].

After a brief Byzantine rule over Armenia between 1045 and 1064, the invading [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuks]]—led by [[Tughril]] and later by his successor [[Alp Arslan]]—ruled over the entire region, including Yerevan. However, with the establishment of the [[Zakarid Armenia|Zakarid Principality of Armenia]] in 1201 under the [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] protectorate, the Armenian territories of Yerevan and Lori had significantly grown. After the Mongols captured [[Ani]] in 1236, Armenia turned into a [[Mongol Armenia|Mongol protectorate]] as part of the [[Ilkhanate]], and the Zakarids became vassals to the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. After the fall of the Ilkhanate in the mid-14th century, the Zakarid princes ruled over Lori, Shirak and the Ararat Plain until 1360 when they fell to the invading Turkic tribes.

During the last quarter of the 14th century, the [[Aq Qoyunlu]] Sunni [[Oghuz Turks|Oghuz Turkic]] tribe took over Armenia, including Yerevan. In 1400, [[Timur]] invaded Armenia and Georgia, and captured more than 60,000 of the survived local people as slaves. Many districts including Yerevan were depopulated.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://rbedrosian.com/atmi4.htm |title=The Turco-Mongol Invasions |publisher=Rbedrosian.com |access-date=2012-05-22 |archive-date=22 July 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722083934/http://rbedrosian.com/atmi4.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1410, Armenia fell under the control of the [[Kara Koyunlu]] Shia Oghuz Turkic tribe. According to the Armenian historian [[Thomas of Metsoph]], although the Kara Koyunlu levied heavy taxes against the Armenians, the early years of their rule were relatively peaceful and some reconstruction of towns took place.<ref>Kouymjian, Dickran (1997), "Armenia from the Fall of the Cilician Kingdom (1375) to the Forced Migration under Shah Abbas (1604)" in ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, Volume II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century'', ed. [[Richard G. Hovannisian]], New York: St. Martin's Press, p. 4. {{ISBN|1-4039-6422-X}}.</ref> The Kara Koyunlus made Yerevan the centre of the newly formed ''Chukhur Saad'' administrative territory. The territory was named after a Turkic leader known as ''Emir Saad''.

However, this peaceful period was shattered with the rise of [[Qara Iskander]] between 1420 and 1436, who reportedly made Armenia a "desert" and subjected it to "devastation and plunder, to slaughter, and captivity".<ref>Kouymjian. "Armenia", p. 4.</ref> The wars of Iskander and his eventual defeat against the [[Timurid Empire|Timurids]], invited further destruction in Armenia, as many more Armenians were taken captive and sold into slavery and the land was subjected to outright pillaging, forcing many of them to leave the region.<ref name="Kouymjian. Armenia, p. 5">Kouymjian. "Armenia", p. 5.</ref>

Following the fall of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] in 1375, the seat of the Armenian Church was transferred from [[Sis (ancient city)|Sis]] back to [[Vagharshapat]] near Yerevan in 1441. Thus, Yerevan became the main economic, cultural and administrative centre in Armenia.

For the following 3 centuries, it remained, with brief intermissions, under the Iranian rule. Due to its strategic significance, Yerevan was initially often fought over, and passed back and forth, between the dominion of the rivaling [[Safavid Empire|Iranian]] and [[Ottoman Empire]], until it permanently became controlled by the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]]. In 1555, Iran had secured its legitimate possession over Yerevan with the Ottomans through the [[Peace of Amasya|Treaty of Amasya]].<ref>''A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East'', Vol. II, ed.

Shah [[Abbas I of Persia]] who ruled between 1588 and 1629, ordered the [[Great Surgun|deportation of hundreds of thousands of Armenians]] including citizens from Yerevan to mainland [[Persia]]. As a consequence, Yerevan significantly lost its Armenian population who had declined to 20%, while Muslims including Persians, Turks, Kurds and Tatars gained dominance with around 80% of the city's population. Muslims were either sedentary, semi-sedentary, or nomadic. Armenians mainly occupied the Kond neighbourhood of Yerevan and the rural suburbs around the city. However, the Armenians dominated over various professions and trade in the area and were of great economic significance to the Persian administration.<ref name="v8f5">[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v8f5/v8f561.html Encyclopaedia Iranica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009205010/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v8f5/v8f561.html |date=9 October 2007 }} (George A.

During the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39)|second Ottoman-Safavid War]], Ottoman troops under the command of Sultan [[Murad IV]] conquered the city on 8 August 1635. Returning in triumph to [[Constantinople]], he opened the "Yerevan Kiosk" (''Revan Köşkü'') in [[Topkapı Palace]] in 1636. However, Iranian troops commanded by [[Safi of Persia|Shah Safi]] retook Yerevan on 1 April 1636. As a result of the [[Treaty of Zuhab]] in 1639, the Iranians reconfirmed their control over Eastern Armenia, including Yerevan. On 7 June 1679, [[1679 Armenia earthquake|a devastating earthquake]] razed the city to the ground.

In 1724, the Erivan Fortress was besieged by the Ottoman army.{{cn|date=March 2023}} After a period of resistance, the fortress fell to the Turks. As a result of the Ottoman invasion, the Erivan Province of the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] was dissolved.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

Following a brief period of Ottoman rule over Eastern Armenia between 1724 and 1736, and as a result of the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1736, Yerevan along with the adjacent territories became part of the newly formed administrative territory of [[Erivan Khanate]] under the [[Afsharid dynasty]] of Iran, which encompassed an area of {{convert|15,000|km²|abbr=off}}.

Yerevan served as the seat of the newly formed [[Armenian Oblast]] between 1828 and 1840.

In 1840, the Armenian Oblast was dissolved and its territory incorporated into a new larger province; the [[Georgia-Imeretia Governorate]]. In 1850 the territory of the former oblast was reorganized into the [[Erivan Governorate]], covering an area of {{convert|28,000|km²|abbr=off}}. Yerevan was the centre of the newly established governorate.

At that period, Yerevan was a small town with narrow roads and alleys, including the central quarter of ''Shahar'', the ''Ghantar'' commercial centre, and the residential neighbourhoods of Kond, Dzoragyugh, Nork and Shentagh. During the 1840s and the 1850s, many schools were opened in the city. However, the first major plan of Yerevan was adopted in 1856, during which, Saint Hripsime and Saint Gayane women's colleges were founded and the [[English Park, Yerevan|English Park]] was opened. In 1863, the [[Abovyan Street|Astafyan Street]] was redeveloped and opened. In 1874, Zacharia Gevorkian opened Yerevan's first printing house, while the first theatre opened its doors in 1879.

On 1 October 1879, Yerevan was granted the status of a city through a decree issued by [[Alexander II of Russia]]. In 1881, The Yerevan Teachers' Seminary and the Yerevan Brewery were opened, followed by the Tairyan's wine and brandy factory in 1887. Other factories for alcoholic beverages and mineral water were opened during the 1890s. The monumental church of [[Saint Gregory the Illuminator Church, Yerevan|Saint Gregory the Illuminator]] was opened in 1900.

At the beginning of the 20th century, Yerevan was a small city with a population of 30,000.<ref name="Univ">{{in lang|fr}} Encyclopædia Universalis France S.A., " Erevan ", 1995.</ref> In 1917, the Russian Empire ended with the [[October Revolution]].

The Federation, however, was short-lived. After gaining control over [[Gyumri|Alexandropol]], the Turkish army was advancing towards the south and east to eliminate the center of Armenian resistance based in Yerevan. On 21 May 1918, the Turks started their campaign moving towards Yerevan via Sardarabad.

By the end of May 1918, Armenians were able to defeat the Turkish army in the battles of [[Battle of Sardarabad|Sardarabad]], [[Battle of Abaran|Abaran]] and [[Battle of Karakilisa|Karakilisa]]. Thus, on 28 May 1918, the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation|Dashnak]] leader [[Aram Manukian]] declared the independence of Armenia. Subsequently, Yerevan became the capital and the center of the newly founded [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]], although the members of the [[Armenian Congress of Eastern Armenians|Armenian National Council]] were yet to stay in [[Tbilisi|Tiflis]] until their arrival in Yerevan to form the government in the summer of the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|title=ФАКТЫ: Передача Иревана от Азербайджана Армении - 16 "за", 1 "против"|url=https://novosti.az/azerbaijan/3635.html|access-date=18 September 2020|archive-date=2 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102043115/http://novosti.az/azerbaijan/3635.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Armenia became a [[parliamentary republic]] with four administrative divisions. The capital Yerevan was part of the ''Araratian Province''. At the time, Yerevan received more than 75,000 refugees from [[Western Armenia]], who escaped the massacres perpetrated by the Ottoman Turks during the [[Armenian genocide]].

On 26 May 1919, the government passed a law to open the [[Yerevan State University]], which was located on the main [[Abovyan Street|Astafyan (now Abovyan) street]] of Yerevan.{{cn|date=May 2023}}

After the signing of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] in 1920, Armenia was granted formal international recognition.

Yerevan had also opened representatives in [[Great Britain]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Serbia]], [[Greece]], [[Iran]] and [[Japan]].{{cn|date=May 2023}}

However, after the short period of independence, Yerevan fell to the [[Bolshevik]]s, and Armenia was incorporated into [[Soviet Russia]] on 2 December 1920.

===Soviet rule===

The [[Red Army|Red Soviet Army]] invaded Armenia on 29 November 1920 from the northeast. On 2 December 1920, Yerevan along with the other territories of the [[First Republic of Armenia|Republic of Armenia]], became part of [[Soviet Russia]], known as the [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. However, the Armenian SSR formed the Transcaucasian SFSR (TSFSR) together with the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic]] and the [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic]], between 1922 and 1936.

Under the Soviet rule, Yerevan became the first among the cities in the Soviet Union for which a general plan was developed. The "General Plan of Yerevan" developed by the academician [[Alexander Tamanian]], was approved in 1924. It was initially designed for a population of 150,000.{{cn|date=February 2023}} The city was quickly transformed into a modern industrial metropolis of over one million people.{{cn|date=February 2023}} New educational, scientific and cultural institutions were founded as well.

Tamanian incorporated national traditions with contemporary urban construction. His design presented a radial-circular arrangement that overlaid the existing city and incorporated much of its existing street plan. As a result, many historic buildings were demolished, including churches, mosques, the [[Erivan Fortress]], baths, bazaars and [[caravanserai]]s. Many of the districts around central Yerevan were named after former Armenian communities that were destroyed by the [[Ottoman Turks]] during the [[Armenian genocide]]. The districts of Arabkir, Malatia-Sebastia and Nork Marash, for example, were named after the towns [[Arapgir|Arabkir]], [[Malatya]], [[Sivas, Turkey|Sebastia]], and [[Kahramanmaraş|Marash]], respectively. After the end of [[World War II]], [[Germans|German]] [[POW]]s were used to help in the construction of new buildings and structures, such as the Kievyan Bridge.{{cn|date=February 2023}}

Within the years, the central [[Kentron district]] has become the most developed area in Yerevan, something that created a significant gap compared with other districts in the city. Most of the educational, cultural and scientific institutions were centred in the Kentron district.

In 1965, during the commemorations of the fiftieth anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, Yerevan was the location of a [[1965 Yerevan demonstrations|demonstration]], the first such demonstration in the Soviet Union, to demand recognition of the Genocide by the Soviet authorities.<ref>{{cite book|last=Suny|first=Ronald Grigor|author-link=Ronald Grigor Suny|title=The Revenge of the Past: Nationalism, Revolution, and the Collapse of the Soviet Union|url=https://archive.org/details/revengepastnatio00suny|url-access=limited|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1993|location=Stanford|page=[https://archive.org/details/revengepastnatio00suny/page/n144 122]|isbn=0-8047-2247-1}}</ref> In 1968, the city's 2,750th anniversary was commemorated.

Yerevan played a key role in the Armenian national democratic movement that emerged during the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] era of the 1980s. The reforms of [[Glasnost]] and [[Perestroika]] opened questions on issues such as the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, the environment, [[Russification]], corruption, democracy, and eventually independence. At the beginning of 1988, nearly one million Armenians from several regions of Armenia engaged in demonstrations concerning these subjects, centered in the city's Theater Square (currently [[Freedom Square, Yerevan|Freedom Square]]).<ref>{{cite book|last=Malkasian|first=Mark|title=Gha-ra-bagh!: The Emergence of the National Democratic Movement in Armenia|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1996|page=41|isbn=0-8143-2605-6}}</ref>

Since 2000, central Yerevan has been transformed into a vast construction site, with cranes erected all over the Kentron district. Officially, the scores of multi-storied buildings are part of large-scale urban planning projects. Roughly $1.8&nbsp;billion was spent on such construction in 2006, according to the national statistical service.{{cn|date=February 2023}} Prices for downtown apartments have increased by about ten times during the first decade of the 21st century.{{cn|date=February 2023}} Many new streets and avenues were opened, such as the Argishti street, Italy street, Saralanj Avenue, Monte Melkonian Avenue, and the [[Northern Avenue (Yerevan)|Northern Avenue]].

However, as a result of this construction boom, the majority of the historic buildings located on the central [[Aram Street]], were either entirely destroyed or transformed into modern residential buildings through the construction of additional floors. Only a few structures were preserved, mainly in the portion that extends between [[Abovyan Street]] and [[Mashtots Avenue]].

Yerevan is located on the banks of the [[Hrazdan River]], northeast of the [[Ararat Plain]], in the central-western part of the country. The upper part of the city is surrounded with mountains on three sides while it descends to the banks of the river [[Hrazdan River|Hrazdan]] at the south. The Hrazdan divides Yerevan into two parts through a picturesque canyon.

===Climate===
[[File:Yerevan 2012 February.JPG|thumb|Winter view of Yerevan]]
Yerevan features a [[continental climate|continental]] influenced [[steppe climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BSk'' or "cold semi-arid climate"), with long, hot, dry summers and short, but cold and snowy winters. This is attributed to Yerevan being on a plain surrounded by mountains and to its distance from the sea and its moderating effects. The summers are usually very hot with the temperature in August reaching up to {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}}, and winters generally carry snowfall and freezing temperatures with January often being as cold as {{convert|-15|°C|0|abbr=on}} and lower. The amount of [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is small, amounting annually to about {{convert|318|mm|in}}. Yerevan experiences an average of 2,700 sunshine hours per year.<ref name="Azatian"/> On 12 July 2018, Yerevan recorded a temperature of {{convert|43.7|C|F|abbr=on}}, which is the joint highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Armenia.<ref name=BAMS2018>{{cite journal |author1=Jessica Blunden |author2=Derek Arndt |title=State of the Climate in 2018 |journal=Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society |year=2019 |volume=100 |issue=9 |pages=Si-S306 |doi=10.1175/2019BAMSStateoftheClimate.1|s2cid=202481135 |doi-access=free |hdl=20.500.12542/276 |hdl-access=free | issn=0003-0007}}</ref>

The [[Republic Square, Yerevan|Republic Square]], the [[Yerevan Opera Theatre]], and the [[Yerevan Cascade]] are among the main landmarks at the centre of Yerevan, mainly developed based on the original design of architect [[Alexander Tamanian]], and the revised plan of architect Jim Torosyan.

A major redevelopment process has been launched in Yerevan since 2000. As a result, many historic structures have been demolished and replaced with new buildings.

===Parks===
[[File:Lovers' Park, Yerevan.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Lovers' Park]]]]
Yerevan is a densely built city but still offers several public parks throughout its districts, graced with mid-sized green gardens. The public park of Erebuni District along with its artificial lake is the oldest garden in the city. Occupying an area of 17 hectares, the origins of the park and the artificial lake date back to the period of king [[Argishti I of Urartu]] during the 8th century BCE. In 2011, the garden was entirely remodelled and named as [[Lyon Park, Yerevan|Lyon Park]], to become a symbol of the partnership between the cities of [[Lyon]] and Yerevan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.am/arm/news/68472.html|title=Էրեբունի վարչական շրջանում բացվել է Երեւան-Լիոն բարեկամության խորհրդանիշ Լիոնի ա|website=news.am|access-date=3 January 2021|archive-date=19 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619012647/https://news.am/arm/news/68472.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Lovers' Park]] on [[Baghramyan Avenue|Marshal Baghramyan Avenue]] and the [[English Park, Yerevan|English Park]] at the centre of the city, dating back to the 18th and 19th centuries respectively, are among the most popular parks in Yerevan. The [[Yerevan Botanical Garden]] (opened in 1935), the [[Victory Park, Yerevan|Victory Park]] (opened in the 1950s) and the [[Circular Park]] are among the largest green spaces of the city.

[[File:Swan Lake, Yerevan-12.jpg|thumb|The ''Swan Lake'']]

Opened in the 1960s, the Yerevan Opera Theatre Park along with its artificial ''Swan Lake'' is also among the favourite green spaces of the city. In 2019 some of the public space of the park leased to restaurants was reclaimed allowing for improved landscape design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://armenpress.am/eng/news/960468.html|title=Yerevan to reclaim portions of city-owned leased space around Opera House to restore landscape|website=armenpress.am|date=11 January 2019 |language=en|access-date=2019-03-17|archive-date=11 January 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190111160355/https://armenpress.am/eng/news/960468.html|url-status=live}}</ref> A public ice-skating arena is operated in the park's lake area during winters.

The [[Yerevan Lake]] is an artificial reservoir opened in 1967 on [[Hrazdan River|Hrazdan]] riverbed at the south of the city centre, with a surface of {{convert|0.65|km²|2|abbr=on}}.

Each administrative district of Yerevan has its own public park, such as the [[Buenos Aires Park]] and [[Tumanyan Park]] in [[Ajapnyak District|Ajapnyak]], Komitas Park in [[Shengavit District|Shengavit]], Vahan Zatikian Park in [[Malatia-Sebastia District|Malatia-Sebastia]], David Anhaght Park in [[Kanaker-Zeytun District|Kanaker-Zeytun]], the Family Park in [[Avan District|Avan]], and Fridtjof Nansen Park in [[Nor Nork District|Nor Nork]].

[[File:2014 Erywań, Budynek Zgromadzenia Narodowego Republiki Armenii.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The [[National Assembly (Armenia)|National Assembly of Armenia]] on [[Baghramyan Avenue]]]]
Yerevan has been the capital of Armenia since the independence of the First Republic in 1918. Situated in the Ararat Plain, the historic lands of Armenia, it served as the best logical choice for capital of the young republic at the time.

When Armenia became a republic of the Soviet Union, Yerevan remained as capital and accommodated all the political and diplomatic institutions in the republic. In 1991 with the independence of Armenia, Yerevan continued with its status as the political and cultural centre of the country, being home to all the national institutions: the [[Government House, Yerevan|Government House]], the [[National Assembly Building of Armenia|National Assembly]], the [[Presidential Palace, Yerevan|Presidential Palace]], the [[Central Bank of Armenia|Central Bank]], the [[Constitutional Court of Armenia|Constitutional Court]], all ministries, judicial bodies and other government organizations.

Yerevan received the status of a city on 1 October 1879, upon a decree issued by Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]]. The first city council formed was headed by Hovhannes Ghorghanyan, who became the first mayor of Yerevan.

The Constitution of the Republic of Armenia adopted on 5 July 1995, granted Yerevan the status of a [[Marz (Armenia)|marz]] (մարզ, province).<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.president.am/library/constitution/eng/?chapter=7|title=Article 108 of the Armenian Constitution|access-date=16 May 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124085555/http://president.am/library/constitution/eng/?chapter=7|archive-date=24 January 2009}}</ref> Therefore, Yerevan functions similarly to the provinces of Armenia with a few specifications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.president.am/library/constitution/eng/?chapter=9|title=Article 117 of the Armenian Constitution|access-date=16 May 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123033934/http://president.am/library/constitution/eng/?chapter=9|archive-date=23 January 2009}}</ref>
The administrative authority of Yerevan is thus represented by:

In the modified Constitution of 27 November 2005, Yerevan city was turned into a "community" (համայնք, ''hamaynk''); since, the Constitution declares that this community has to be led by a mayor, elected directly or indirectly, and that the city needs to be governed by a specific law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.president.am/library/constitution/eng/ |title=Articles 88.1 and 108 of the Armenian Constitution |access-date=16 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013082548/http://www.president.am/library/constitution/eng/ |archive-date=13 October 2008 }}</ref> The first election of the Yerevan City Council took place in [[Yerevan City Council election, 2009|2009]] and won by the ruling [[Republican Party of Armenia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/APFeaturesManager/defaultArtSiteVoir.asp?ID=729|title=Declaration of a member of the Assembly of the Council of Europe.|access-date=16 May 2008|language=fr|archive-date=18 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718090016/http://assembly.coe.int/ASP/APFeaturesManager/defaultArtSiteVoir.asp?ID=729|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.am/en/society/2007/10/18/ereven/|title=Panorama.am, ''Executive prefers to have indirect elections for mayor''|date=18 October 2007|access-date=16 May 2008|archive-date=18 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718080816/http://www.panorama.am/en/society/2007/10/18/ereven/|url-status=live}}</ref>

After the [[Armenian genocide]], many refugees from what Armenians call [[Western Armenia]] (nowadays Turkey, then [[Ottoman Empire]]) escaped to Eastern Armenia. In 1919, about 75,000 Armenian refugees from the Ottoman Empire arrived in Yerevan, mostly from the [[Vaspurakan]] region (city of [[Van, Turkey|Van]] and [[Van vilayet|surroundings]]). A significant part of these refugees died of typhus and other diseases.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/republicofarmeni0000hova|title=The Republic of Armenia|first=Richard G.|last=Hovannisian|date=3 January 1971|publisher=Berkeley, University of California Press|access-date=3 January 2021|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

From 1921 to 1936, about 42,000 ethnic Armenians from Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Greece, Syria, France, Bulgaria etc. went to Soviet Armenia, with most of them settling in Yerevan. The second wave of repatriation occurred from 1946 to 1948, when about 100,000 ethnic Armenians from Iran, Syria, Lebanon, Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, Cyprus, Palestine, Iraq, Egypt, France, United States etc. moved to Soviet Armenia, again most of whom settled in Yerevan. Thus, the ethnic makeup of Yerevan became more [[Monoethnicity|monoethnic]] during the first 3 decades in the Soviet Union. The Azerbaijani population of Yerevan, who made up 43% of the population of the city prior to the [[October Revolution]], dropped to 0.7% by 1959 and further to 0.1% by 1989, during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yiObBPPjXbYC&q=Language+Policy+in+the+Soviet+Union Language Policy in the Soviet Union] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200527195439/https://books.google.com/books?id=yiObBPPjXbYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Language+Policy+in+the+Soviet+Union&sig=I22mQT_vcbgrfEyAy6K6MLbHwgk |date=27 May 2020 }} by Lenore A.

[[File:Saint Peter and Paul Church, Yerevan.jpg|thumb|left|The 5th-century [[Saint Paul and Peter Church, Yerevan|Saint Paul and Peter Church]]]]

[[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic Christianity]] is the predominant religion in Armenia. The 5th-century [[Saint Paul and Peter Church, Yerevan|Saint Paul and Peter Church]] demolished in November 1930 by the Soviets, was among the earliest churches ever built in Erebuni-Yerevan. Many of the ancient Armenian and medieval churches of the city were destroyed by the Soviets in the 1930s during the [[Great Purge]].

The regulating body of the Armenian Church in Yerevan is the [[Araratian Pontifical Diocese]], with the [[Saint Sarkis Cathedral, Yerevan|Surp Sarkis Cathedral]] being the seat of the diocese. It is the largest diocese of the Armenian Church and one of the oldest dioceses in the world, covering the city of Yerevan and the [[Ararat Province]] of Armenia.<ref name="araratian-tem1"/>

Yerevan is currently home to the largest Armenian church in the world, the [[Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral, Yerevan|Cathedral of Saint Gregory the Illuminator]].

After the capture of Yerevan by the Russians as a result of the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Russo-Persian War of 1826–28]], many [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] churches were built in the city under the orders of the Russian commander General [[Ivan Paskevich]]. The [[Saint Nikolai Cathedral, Yerevan|Saint Nikolai Cathedral]] opened during the second half of the 19th century, was the largest Russian church in the city.

However, most of the churches were either closed or demolished by the Soviets during the 1930s. The Saint Nikolai Cathedral was entirely destroyed in 1931, while the Church of the Intercession of the Holy Mother of God was closed and converted first into a warehouse and later into a club for the military personnel. Religious services resumed in the church in 1991, and in 2004 a cupola and a belfry were added to the building.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mospat.ru/en/2010/03/17/news14638/ |title=Russian Orthodox Church, External Church Relations Official Website:Patriarch Kirill visits a Russian church in Yerevan |publisher=Mospat.ru |date=17 March 2010 |access-date=1 May 2011 |archive-date=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624010423/https://mospat.ru/en/2010/03/17/news14638/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2010, the groundbreaking ceremony of the new Holy Cross Russian Orthodox church took place with the presence of Patriarch [[Kirill I of Moscow]].

===Art===
{{Main|Armenian art}}
[[File:Yerevan Vernissage carpets.jpg|thumb|left|Handmade Armenian rugs at the Yerevan Vernissage]]
Yerevan is one of the historic centres of traditional [[Armenian carpet]]. Various rug fragments have been excavated in areas around Yerevan dating back to the 7th century BC or earlier. The tradition was further developed from the 16th century when Yerevan became the central city of [[Persian Armenia (1502-1828)|Persian Armenia]]. However, carpet manufacturing in the city was greatly enriched with the flock of Western Armenian migrants from the [[Ottoman Empire]] throughout the 19th century, and the arrival of Armenian refugees escaping the genocide in the early 20th century. Currently, the city is home to the Arm Carpet factory opened in 1924, as well as the Tufenkian handmade carpets (since 1994), and Megerian handmade carpets (since 2000).

[[File:Erevan church.jpg|thumb|[[Katoghike Church, Yerevan|Katoghike Church]] in Yerevan]]
[[File:St Zoravor church in Yerevan 01.JPG|thumb|[[Zoravor Surp Astvatsatsin Church]]]]
Many of the structures of Yerevan had been destroyed either during foreign invasions or as a result of the devastating [[1679 Armenia earthquake|earthquake in 1679]]. However, some structures have remained moderately intact and were renovated during the following years.

[[Erebuni Fortress]], also known as ''Arin Berd'', is the hill where the city of Yerevan was founded in 782 BC by King [[Argishti I of Urartu|Argishti I]]. The remains of other structures from earlier periods are also found in Shengavit.
[[File:2014 Erywań, Błękitny Meczet (09).jpg|thumb|The Blue Mosque]]
The 4th-century chapel of the Holy Mother of God and the 6th-century [[Katoghike Tsiranavor Church of Avan|Tsiranavor Church]] both located in [[Avan District]] at the north of Yerevan, are among the oldest surviving Christian structures of the city. Originally a suburb at the north of Yerevan, Avan was eventually absorbed by the city's gradual expansion. The district is also home to the remains of Surp Hovhannes Chapel dating back to the 12–13th centuries.

[[Katoghike Church, Yerevan|Katoghike Church]]; a medieval chapel (a section of once much larger basilica) in the centre of Yerevan, built in 1264, is one of the best preserved churches of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://am.chineseembassy.org/chn/lsqw/t1405205.htm|script-title=zh:中国公民赴亚美尼亚注意事项|access-date=2017-07-09|date=2016-04-27|publisher=中华人民共和国驻亚美尼亚共和国大使馆|language=zh|archive-date=8 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200908055211/http://am.chineseembassy.org/chn/lsqw/t1405205.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Zoravor Surp Astvatsatsin Church]] is also among the best surviving churches of Yerevan, built 1693–94 right after the devastating earthquake, on the ruins of a medieval church. [[Saint Sarkis Cathedral, Yerevan|Saint Sarkis Cathedral]] rebuilt in 1835–42, is the seat of [[Araratian Pontifical Diocese]] of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]].

The [[Blue Mosque, Yerevan|Blue Mosque]] or "Gök Jami", built between 1764 and 1768 at the centre of the city, is currently the only operating mosque in Armenia.

The [[Red Bridge (Yerevan)|Red Bridge]] of [[Hrazdan River]] is a 17th-century structure, built after the 1679 earthquake and later reconstructed in 1830.

====Contemporary====
[[File:Ցեղասպանության թանգարան.JPG|thumb|Aerial view of Tsitsernakaberd memorial and the [[Armenian genocide|genocide]] museum]]
[[Yerevan Opera Theater]] or the Armenian National Academic Opera and Ballet Theatre opened in 1933, is a major landmark in the city along with the [[Matenadaran|Mesrop Mashtots Matenadaran]] opened in 1959, and [[Tsitsernakaberd]] monument of the [[Armenian genocide]] opened in 1967.

[[Moscow Cinema]], opened in 1937 on the site of [[Saint Paul and Peter Church, Yerevan|Saint Paul and Peter Church]] of the 5th century, is an important example of the Soviet-era architecture. In 1959, a monument was erected near the Yerevan Railway Station dedicated to the legendary Armenian hero [[David of Sassoun]]. The monumental statue of [[Mother Armenia]] is a female personification of the Armenian nation, erected in 1967, replacing the huge statue of [[Joseph Stalin]] in the [[Victory Park, Yerevan|Victory park]].

[[Komitas Pantheon]] is a cemetery opened in 1936 where many famous Armenians are buried, while the [[Yerablur]] Pantheon, is a military cemetery where over 1,000 Armenian martyrs of the [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]] are buried since 1990.

Many new notable buildings were constructed after the independence of Armenia such as the [[Yerevan Cascade]], and the [[Saint Gregory the Illuminator Cathedral, Yerevan|Saint Gregory Cathedral]] opened in 2001 to commemorate the 1700th anniversary of Christianity in Armenia. In May 2016, a monumental statue of the prominent Armenian statesman and military leader [[Garegin Nzhdeh]] was erected at the centre of Yerevan.

==Transportation==
===Air===
[[File:Zvartnots airport.jpg|thumb|The main entrance to the [[Zvartnots Airport]]]]
Yerevan is served by the [[Zvartnots International Airport]], located {{convert|12|km|0|abbr=off}} west of the city center.

A second airport, [[Erebuni Airport]], is located just south of the city. Since the independence, "Erebuni" is mainly used for military or private flights. The [[Armenian Air Force]] has equally installed its base there and there are several [[MiG-29]]s stationed on Erebuni's tarmac.

===City buses, public vans and trolleybuses===
{{Update section|date=May 2024}}
{{main|Trolleybuses in Yerevan}}
[[File:2014 Erywań, Marszrutka w centrum stolicy (01).jpg|thumb|A [[marshrutka]]]]
Public transport in Yerevan is heavily privatized and mostly handled by around 60 private operators. As of May 2017, 39 city bus lines are being operated throughout Yerevan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.yerevan.am/am/transport-department/ |title=Transport department of Yerevan Municipality |access-date=5 July 2016 |language=hy |archive-date=15 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815015711/https://www.yerevan.am/am/transport-department/ |url-status=live }}</ref> These lines mostly consist of about 425 [[Bogdan (bus company)|Bogdan]], [[Higer Bus|Higer City Bus]] and [[Hyundai County]] buses. However, the market share these buses in public transit is only about 39.1%.

But the 50.4% of public transit is still served by "public vans", locally known as [[marshrutka]]. These are about 1210 Russian-made [[GAZelle]] vans with 13 seats, that operate same way as buses, having 79 different lines with certain routes and same stops. According to Yerevan Municipality office, in future, marshrutkas should be replaced by ordinary larger buses. Despite having about 13 seats, the limit of passengers is not controlled, so usually these vans carry many more people who stand inside.

The [[Trolleybuses in Yerevan|Yerevan trolleybus system]] has been operating since 1949. Some old Soviet-era trolleybuses have been replaced with comparably new ones. As of May 2017, only 5 trolleybus lines are in operation (2.6% share), with around 45 units in service. The trolleybus system is owned and operated by the municipality.
[[File:Yerevan trolleybus view.jpg|thumb|A trolleybus in Yerevan]]
The tram network that operated in Yerevan since 1906 was decommissioned in January 2004. Its operation had a cost 2.4 times higher than the generated profits, which pushed the municipality to shut down the network,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armeniadiaspora.com/js04/040122tram.html |title=Arminfo, "Last Tram Put Out Of Operation in Yerevan" |date=22 January 2004 |access-date=19 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071027234752/http://www.armeniadiaspora.com/js04/040122tram.html |archive-date=27 October 2007 }}</ref> despite a last-ditch effort to save it towards the end of 2003. Since the closure, the rails have been dismantled and sold.

Due to being dispersed among dozens of private operators, the transportation is barely regulated, with only trip fee is being a subject of regulation. Thus, the quality of vehicles is often inadequate, with no certain regulations for safety. Unlike the majority of world capitals, there is no established ticketing system in Yerevan's public transportation. Passengers need to pay the money directly to the driver when getting out of the vehicle. The fare -being one of the few things that is regulated- is fixed and controlled by authorities.

The central station in Nor Kilikia neighbourhood serves as bus terminal for inter-city transport, serving outbound routes towards practically all the cities of Armenia as well as abroad, notably [[Tbilisi]] and [[Tabriz]].

===Underground===
{{Main|Yerevan Metro}}
[[File:Metro Yerevan Republic Square metro station.jpg|thumb|The [[Republic Square (metro station)|Republic Square underground station]]]]
The [[Yerevan Metro]] named after Karen Demirchyan, ({{langx|hy|Կարեն Դեմիրճյանի անվան Երեւանի մետրոպոլիտեն կայարան}} (''Karen Dyemirchyani anvan Yerevani metropoliten kayaran'')) is a [[rapid transit]] system that serves the capital city since 1981. It has a single line of {{convert|12.1|km|mi|abbr=on}} length with 10 active stations and 45 units in service. The interiors of the stations resemble that of the former western Soviet nations, with [[chandelier]]s hanging from the corridors. The metro stations had most of their names changed after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the independence of the Republic of Armenia.

A northeastern extension of the line with two new stations is currently being developed. The construction of the first station (''Ajapnyak'') and of the {{convert|1|km|spell=in|adj=on|abbr=off}} tunnel linking it to the rest of the network will cost US$18&nbsp;million.<ref>Announcement by Prime Minister [[Serge Sargsyan]] during a visit to the network in January 2008.</ref> The time of the end of the project has not yet been defined. Another long-term project is the construction of two new lines, but these have been suspended due to lack of finance.

The system transports more than 60,000 people on a daily basis.{{cn|date=February 2023}}

===Railway===
{{Main|Armenian Railway}}
[[File:David of Sasun Yerevan.jpg|thumb|Yerevan railway station, with the [[Sasuntsi Davit (statue)|statue]] of [[David of Sassoun]]]]
Yerevan has a single central railway station (several railway stations of suburbs have not been used since 1990) that is connected to the metro via the ''Sasuntsi Davit'' station. The railway station is made in Soviet-style architecture with its long point on the building roof, representing the symbols of communism: [[red star]], [[hammer and sickle]]. Due to the Turkish and Azerbaijani blockades of Armenia, there is only one international train that passes by once every two days, with neighboring Georgia being its destination. For a sum of 9&nbsp;000 to 18&nbsp;000 [[Armenian dram|dram]], it is possible to take the night train to the Georgian capital, Tbilisi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-81016.html |title=ArmenPress, "Yerevan - Batumi railway communication to resume in Summer", ArmeniaDiaspora.com |date=15 February 2007 |access-date=19 May 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404095535/http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/forum/archive/index.php/t-81016.html |archive-date=4 April 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This train then continues to its destination of [[Batumi]], on the shores of the [[Black sea]] in the summer season.

The only railway that goes to Iran to the south passes by the closed border of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic|Nakhchivan]]. For this reason, there are no trains that go south from Yerevan.

During the first decade of the 21st century, the South Caucasus Railway CJSC — which is the current operator of the railway system in Armenia—announced its readiness to put the Yerevan-Gyumri-Kars railway line in service in case the Armenian-Turkish protocols are ratified and the opening of the borders between the two countries is achieved.

As of July 2017, the following railway trips are scheduled from and to Yerevan:
* Yerevan-Tbilisi-Batumi-Yerevan, with a daily trip operating since 15 June 2017, in coordination with the [[Georgian Railways]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ukzhd.am/batumi2014/arm/schedule.html |title=Yerevan-Tbilisi-Batumi-Yerevan railway trip |access-date=19 July 2017 |archive-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180621011934/http://www.ukzhd.am/batumi2014/arm/schedule.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
