== History ==
Tsuyama was the center of ancient [[Mimasaka Province]] and the location of its [[kokufu]] and the [[Mimasaka Kokubun-ji]]. It was also on the pilgrimage route to [[Izumo Shrine]] and had a number of [[shukuba|inn stations]]. In the latter half of the [[Sengoku period]], [[Mori Ranmaru]]'s younger brother, Mori Tadamasa, received the area as his domain. He constructed Tsuruyama Castle on the site of an ancient castle which had been erected by the [[Yamana clan]], and laid out a new [[jōkamachi|castle town]] which became the nucleus of the modern city. At the same time, Tsuruyama was renamed "Tsuyama". 

Under the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], [[Tsuyama Castle]] was the headquarters of a cadet branch of the [[Matsudaira clan]] and the center of [[Tsuyama Domain]]. Tsuyama is known for the 17th century [[Tsuyama Castle]], whose grandeur was said to rival that of [[Himeji Castle]] in neighboring [[Hyōgo Prefecture]]. The castle was destroyed in 1874. Today only the stone foundations remain, except for a single turret that was reconstructed in 2005. 

The castle ruins remain Tsuyama's main tourist attraction along with Joto Street, a narrow street of old, traditional buildings that was once part of the pilgrimage route from [[Kyoto]] to [[Izumo Province|Izumo]], and [[Shūraku-en]], a traditional [[Japanese garden]] constructed in 1657. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the town of Tsuyama was established in June 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to city status in February 1929.

In 1938, 31 people died in the [[Tsuyama massacre]], a spree killing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/topics/news/20080609-OHT1T00095.htm|script-title=ja:理不尽な凶行、遺族ら「無念」…秋葉原無差別殺傷事件|publisher=[[Sports Hochi]]|language=ja|date=9 June 2008|access-date=13 June 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613225006/http://hochi.yomiuri.co.jp/topics/news/20080609-OHT1T00095.htm|archive-date=13 June 2008}}</ref>

In February 2005, the town of [[Kamo, Okayama|Kamo]], the village of [[Aba, Okayama|Aba]] (both from [[Tomata District, Okayama|Tomata District]]), the town of [[Shōboku, Okayama|Shōboku]] (from [[Katsuta District, Okayama|Katsuta District]]), and the town of [[Kume, Okayama|Kume]] (from [[Kume District, Okayama|Kume District]]) were merged into Tsuyama.

==Government==

In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Okayama 3rd district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
