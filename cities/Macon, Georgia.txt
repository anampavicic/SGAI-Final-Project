'''Macon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|k|ən}} {{respell|MAY|kən}}), officially '''Macon–Bibb County''', is a [[consolidated city-county]] in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], United States. Situated near the [[Atlantic Seaboard fall line|fall line]] of the [[Ocmulgee River]], it is {{convert|85|mi}} southeast of [[Atlanta]] and near the state's geographic center—hence its nickname "[[Central Georgia|The Heart of Georgia]]".

Macon's population was 157,346 in the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]].<ref name="QuickFacts">{{cite web |title=QuickFacts: Macon-Bibb County, Georgia |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/us-cities/macon-ga-population |publisher=United States Census Bureau |date=May 2024 |access-date=August 7, 2024}}</ref> It is the principal city of the [[Macon Metropolitan Statistical Area|Macon metropolitan statistical area]], which had 234,802 people in 2020.<ref name="2020Pop" /> It also is the largest city in the Macon–Warner Robins [[Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA), which had approximately 420,693 residents in 2017 and abuts the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] to the northwest.

Voters approved the consolidation of the City of Macon and [[Bibb County, Georgia|Bibb County]] governments in a 2012 referendum. Macon became the state's fourth-largest city (after [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]]) when the merger became official on January 1, 2014.<ref name=maconbibb>{{cite web |url=http://www.macon.com/2012/07/31/2116420/first-macon-bibb-county-consolidation.html |work=The Macon Telegraph |title=Macon-Bibb County consolidation wins with strong majorities |date=July 31, 2012 |access-date=2012-08-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140719125943/http://www.macon.com/2012/07/31/2116420/first-macon-bibb-county-consolidation.html |archive-date=July 19, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Macon is served by three [[Interstate Highway System|interstate highways]]: [[Interstate 16|I-16]] (connecting to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] and coastal Georgia), [[Interstate 75 in Georgia|I-75]] (connecting to Atlanta to the north and Valdosta to the south), and [[Interstate 475 (Georgia)|I-475]] (a city bypass highway). The area has two small general aviation airports, [[Middle Georgia Regional Airport]] and [[Macon Downtown Airport|Herbert Smart Downtown Airport]]. Residents traveling to and from the area mainly use the large commercial airport in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], approximately 80 miles to the northwest.

The city has several institutions of higher education and numerous museums and tourism sites.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Macon, Georgia}}
Macon was founded on the site of the Ocmulgee Old Fields, where the [[Creek Indians]] lived in the 18th century. Their predecessors, the [[Mississippian culture]], built a powerful agriculture-based [[chiefdom]] (950–1100 AD). The Mississippian culture constructed [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthwork]] [[mound]]s for ceremonial, religious, and burial purposes. [[Indigenous peoples]] inhabited the areas along the Southeast's rivers for 13,000 years before Europeans arrived.<ref name="georgiaencyclopedia1">{{cite web |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=%2FHistoryArchaeology%2FArchaeologyandEarlyHistory%2FArchaeologicalPeriodsinGeorgia%2FArchaicPrehistoricPeriod&id=h-810 |title=Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=Georgia Encyclopedia |date=May 20, 2009 |access-date=2012-05-30 |archive-date=September 6, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906084250/http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=%2FHistoryArchaeology%2FArchaeologyandEarlyHistory%2FArchaeologicalPeriodsinGeorgia%2FArchaicPrehistoricPeriod&id=h-810 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Macon was developed at the site of [[Fort Benjamin Hawkins]], built in 1809 at President [[Thomas Jefferson|Thomas Jefferson's]] direction after he forced the Creek to cede their lands east of the [[Ocmulgee River]]. (Archeological excavations in the 21st century found evidence of two separate fortifications.)<ref name="macon">{{cite web |title=Fort Hawkins |url=http://cityofmacon.net/visitors-museums-fort_hawkins |url-status=usurped |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919235143/http://cityofmacon.net/visitors-museums-fort_hawkins |archive-date=September 19, 2010 |access-date=2017-06-25 |website=cityofmacon.net}}</ref> The fort was named for [[Benjamin Hawkins]], who served as Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Southeast territory south of the Ohio River for more than 20 years, had lived among the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek]], and was married to a Creek woman. Located at the [[fall line]] of the [[Ocmulgee River]], the fort established a trading post with Native peoples at the river's most inland point navigable from the [[South Carolina Lowcountry|Low Country]].

Fort Hawkins guarded the Lower Creek Pathway, an extensive and well-traveled [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] network that the U.S. government later improved as the [[Federal Road (Creek lands)|Federal Road]], linking Washington, D.C., to the ports of [[Mobile, Alabama]] and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].<ref name="macon"/> Used for trading with the Creek, the fort also was used by state militia and federal troops. It was a major military distribution point during the [[War of 1812]] and the [[Creek War]] of 1813. After the wars, it was a trading post and garrisoned troops until 1821. Decommissioned around 1828, it later burned to the ground. A replica of the southeast blockhouse was built in 1938 and stands on an east Macon hill.  Fort Hawkins Grammar School occupied part of the site. In the 21st century, archeological excavations have revealed more of the fort, increasing its historical significance, and led to further reconstruction planning for this major historical site.<ref name="macon"/>

With the arrival of more settlers, [[Fort Hawkins]] was renamed "Newtown". After [[Bibb County, Georgia|Bibb County]]'s organization in 1822, the city was  chartered as the county seat in 1823 and officially named Macon, in honor of [[Nathaniel Macon]],<ref>{{cite book|last=Gannett|first=Henry|title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States|url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ|year=1905|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=[https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ/page/n194 195]}}</ref> a statesman from North Carolina, from where many early Georgia residents hailed.

Because of the beneficial local [[Black Belt (geological formation)|Black Belt]] geology and the availability of [[Slavery in the United States|slave labor]], cotton became the mainstay of Macon's early economy.<ref name="search.ebscohost.com">{{cite journal|last1=Davis|first1=Robert Scott|title=A Cotton Kingdom Retooled for War: The Macon Arsenal and the Confederate Ordnance Establishment|journal=Georgia Historical Quarterly|date=2007|volume=91|issue=3|pages=266–291|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=26628620&site=eds-live&scope=site|access-date=15 February 2018}}</ref> The city's location on the Ocmulgee River aided initial economic expansion, providing shipping access to new markets. Cotton [[steamboats]], stagecoaches, and the 1843 arrival of the [[railroad]] increased marketing opportunities and contributed to Macon's  economic prosperity.

Macon's growth had other benefits. In 1836, the Georgia Conference of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] chose Macon as the location for [[Wesleyan College]], the first U.S. college to grant women college degrees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dlg.galileo.usg.edu/GeorgiaReferenceShelf/HigherEducation.html?Welcome |title=Colleges and Universities |publisher=Dlg.galileo.usg.edu |date=January 1, 1970 |access-date=2012-02-29}}</ref> Nonetheless, Macon came in last in the 1855 referendum voting to be Georgia's capital city with 3,802 votes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://roadsidegeorgia.com/city/macon.html |title=Macon, Georgia |website=Roadsidegeorgia.com |date=March 19, 1990 |access-date=2017-01-29 |archive-date=December 19, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219125047/http://roadsidegeorgia.com/city/macon.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Macon City Hall served as the temporary state capitol in 1864 and was converted to a hospital for wounded Confederate soldiers. The Union General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] spared Macon on his [[Sherman's March to the Sea|march to the sea]]. His troops sacked the nearby state capital of [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]], and Maconites prepared for an attack. Sherman, however, passed by without entering Macon.

The ''[[Macon Telegraph]]'' reported the city had furnished 23 companies of men for the Confederacy, but casualties were high. By war end, Maconite survivors fit for duty could fill only five companies.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/cottonfiredreams00davi |url-access=registration |page=[https://archive.org/details/cottonfiredreams00davi/page/123 123] |quote=macon arsenal. |title=Cotton, Fire and Dreams |publisher=Mercer University Press |access-date=2012-05-30|isbn=9780865545984 |last1=Davis |first1=Robert Scott |year=1998 }}</ref>

Macon has been impacted by natural catastrophes. In 1994 [[Tropical Storm Alberto (1994)|Tropical Storm Alberto]] made [[Wiktionary:landfall|landfall]] in [[Florida]] and flooded several Georgia cities. Macon, which received {{convert|24|in|cm}} of rain, suffered major flooding.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/07/06/us/record-rain-pelts-georgia-4-die-in-flood.html |work=The New York Times | title=Record Rain Pelts Georgia; 4 Die in Flood | date=July 31, 2012 | access-date=2010-05-12}}</ref>

On [[Tornado outbreak sequence of May 7–11, 2008|May 11, 2008]], an [[Enhanced Fujita Scale|EF2]] tornado hit Macon. Touching down in nearby Lizella, the tornado moved northeast to the southern shore of [[Lake Tobesofkee]], continued into Macon, and lifted near Dry Branch in Twiggs County. The storm's total path length was {{convert|18|miles}}, and its path width was {{convert|100|yards}}.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} The tornado produced sporadic areas of major damage, with widespread straight-line wind damage along its southern track. The most significant damage was along Eisenhower Parkway and Pio Nono Avenue in Macon, where two businesses were destroyed and several others were heavily damaged. The tornado also impacted Middle Georgia State College, where almost half of the campus's trees were snapped or uprooted and several buildings were damaged, with the gymnasium suffering the worst. The tornado's intensity varied from EF0 to EF2, with the EF2 damage and winds up to {{convert|130|mph}} occurring near the intersection of Eisenhower Parkway and Pio Nono Avenue.

==Geography==
[[File:Maconbibbcourthouse.jpg|thumb|The Macon-[[Bibb County Courthouse (Georgia)|Bibb County Courthouse]]]]

The [[Ocmulgee River]] is a major river that runs through the city. Macon is one of Georgia's three major [[Fall Line Cities]], along with [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]] and [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]. The Fall Line is where the hilly lands of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] [[plateau]] meet the flat terrain of the [[coastal plain]]. As such, Macon has a varied landscape of rolling hills on the north side and flat plains on the south.

==Economy==
The aerospace, advanced manufacturing, food processing, healthcare, professional services, and warehouse and distribution industries drive the economy in Macon-Bibb County. Long-standing large private employers include [[Mercer University]], [[GEICO]]'s Southeast Corporate Headquarters, [[YKK]] USA, and [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s Brosnan Yard.

The decline of the textile industry in the South, along with the shuttering of other large manufacturing operations, such as the closing of the [[Brown & Williamson|Brown and Williamson]] plant in 2006, caused a decline in the city's economy in the 2000s. In recent years, the city has successfully landed numerous new employers to diversify the economy, such as Irving Consumer Products and Kuhmo Tire manufacturing plants, as well as multiple aerospace employers at the [[Middle Georgia Regional Airport]], including an [[Embraer]] aircraft maintenance facility.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://mbcia.com/doing-business/leading-industries/ | title=Leading Industries }}</ref>

===Baconsfield Park===
U.S. Senator [[Augustus Bacon]], of Georgia, in his 1911 will, devised land in Macon in trust, to be used as a public park for the exclusive benefit of white people. The park, known as Baconsfield, was operated in that manner for many years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Case over Baconsfield Park |url=https://faculty.mercer.edu/davis_da/fys102/baconsfield.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141104092909/http://faculty.mercer.edu/davis_da/fys102/baconsfield.html |archive-date=2014-11-04 |access-date=2022-09-02 |website=Mercer University}}</ref> In ''Evans v. Newton'',<ref>382 U.S. 296 (1966),</ref> the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held that the park could not continue to be operated on a racially discriminatory basis. The [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court of Georgia]] thereupon declared "that the sole purpose for which the trust was created has become impossible of accomplishment" and remanded the case to the trial court, which held [[Cy-près doctrine|cy-près]] doctrine to be inapplicable, since the park's segregated character was an essential and inseparable part of Bacon's plan. The trial court ruled that the trust failed and that the property reverted to Bacon's heirs. The Supreme Court of Georgia<ref>224 Ga. 826, 165 S.E.2d 160 (1968)</ref> and the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed.<ref>Evans v. Abney, 396 U.S. 435 (1970).</ref> The 50-acre (20 ha) park was lost and commercially developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/the-bearfaced-truth/baconsfield-macons-missing-park-1fe5ec37c0cb|title = Baconsfield: Macon's Missing Park|date = May 3, 2019}}</ref>

==References in popular culture==
===''The Simpsons''===
In "[[Bart on the Road]]", the Season 7 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'', character [[Nelson Muntz]] suggests the boys take a road trip to Macon. Later he reminds the group that none of their trouble would have happened had they chosen Macon over [[Knoxville, Tennessee]].

===''Gone with the Wind''===
In [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'', Aunt Pittypat's coachman, Uncle Peter, protected her when she fled to Macon during [[William Tecumseh Sherman|Sherman]]'s assault on [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]].

=== Telltale's ''The Walking Dead'' ===
The city of Macon is visited in ''[[The Walking Dead (video game)|The Walking Dead]]'' episodic adventure game by [[Telltale Games]] and its standalone DLC ''400 Days''.

In ''Season One'', the city is portrayed as a small rural town and is visited by the main characters as they temporarily set up camp in the city. The city is the hometown of the game's main protagonist and the playable character throughout the game, [[Lee Everett]]. He and the other survivors barricade themselves inside his family's pharmacy as they are besieged by zombies. After one of the survivors dies, the group heads to a motel on the outskirts of Macon where they set up camp for two more episodes, before eventually deciding to leave the city for [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]].

In ''400 Days'', the city is briefly shown in the episode "Vince's Story" as a flashback to when the episode's main character, Vince, fatally shoots an unseen and unnamed resident of the city before fleeing into the night before the apocalypse began. This murder would ultimately lead to Vince's arrest and the events that occurred at the beginning of the zombie apocalypse.

====Mass transit====
[[File:Macon Transit Authority MAC City Bus.jpg|thumb|right|MTA-MAC City Bus]]

The [[Macon Transit Authority]] (MTA) is Macon's public-transit system, operating the Public Transit City Bus System throughout Macon-Bibb County. As of 2022, the MTA has a total of 10 city bus routes, operating out of the [[Terminal Station (Macon, Georgia)|Terminal Station]] hub.<ref name="ridingMacon">{{cite news |last1=Eason |first1=Jenna |title=Riding the bus in Macon isn't so hard.

====Intercity bus and rail====
[[Greyhound Lines]] provides intercity bus service. In 2019, they moved from a stand-alone bus station to the Terminal Station to be in the same hub as the local mass transit busses.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kousouris |first1=Abby |title='It's all here in the same building:' Greyhound station relocates to Macon Transit hub |url=https://www.13wmaz.com/article/news/greyhound-station-relocates-to-macon-transit-hub/93-75c3b023-c5a7-4161-91ae-8e4b6b7ce0e8 |access-date=29 May 2022 |work=13wmaz.com |date=31 July 2019}}</ref>

Macon grew as a center of rail transport after the 1846 opening of the [[Macon and Western Railroad]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nscorp.com/nscportal/nscorp/Community/NS%20History/timeline.html |title=Norfolk Southern – The Thoroughbred of Transportation &#124; Creating green jobs shipping freight by rail |publisher=Nscorp.com |access-date=2012-02-29 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315214622/http://www.nscorp.com/nscportal/nscorp/Community/NS%20History/timeline.html |archive-date=March 15, 2012 }}</ref>  Two of the most note-worthy train companies operating through the city were the [[Central of Georgia Railway]] and the [[Southern Railway (U.S.)|Southern Railway]].  The city continued to be served by passenger trains at Terminal Station until 1971. The [[Frisco Railroad]]'s ''[[Kansas City–Florida Special]]'' served the city until 1964.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.american-rails.com/kansas-city-florida-special.html | title="Kansas City-Florida Special" (Train): Timetable, Schedule }}</ref> The Southern's ''[[Royal Palm (train)|Royal Palm]]'' ran from Cincinnati, through Macon, to [[Miami, Florida]] until 1966. (A truncated route served to Valdosta, Georgia until 1970.) The Central of Georgia's ''[[Nancy Hanks (train)|Nancy Hanks]]'' ran through Macon, from [[Atlanta]] to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] until 1971.
Since at least 2006 Macon has been included in the proposed [[Georgia Rail Passenger Program]] to restore inter-city rail service but as of 2020, Georgia lacks any inter-city passenger rail service other than the federally funded inter-state [[Amtrak]] services. In 2022, [[Amtrak]] announced a new fifteen year plan to expand its services, which Macon was included in.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.13wmaz.com/article/news/federal-infrastructure-plan-could-bring-rail-stop-to-macon/93-c7b01134-e262-4ae6-a345-58a278b4969c|title = People in Macon could soon catch a train to Atlanta, Savannah under new federal infrastructure plan|date = April 4, 2021}}</ref>
