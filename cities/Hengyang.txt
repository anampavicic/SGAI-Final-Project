'''Hengyang''' ({{zh|s={{linktext|衡阳}} |t={{linktext|衡陽}} |p=Héngyáng}};  {{small|Mandarin pronunciation:}} {{IPAc-cmn|h|eng|2|.|yang|2|}}) is the second largest city of [[Hunan]] Province, [[China]]. It straddles the [[Xiang River]] about {{convert|160|km|abbr=on}} south of the provincial capital of [[Changsha]]. As of the [[2020 Chinese census]], Its total population was 6,645,243 inhabitants, of whom 1,290,715 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area consisting of 4 urban districts, Nanyue District not being conurbated yet.

Hengyang is home to [[University of South China]], [[Hengyang Normal University]], and [[Hunan Institute of Technology]], three major provincial [[Public university|public universities]] in the city.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last= |first= |date= |title=US News Best Global Universities Ranking.

==History==
{{More citations needed section|date=November 2019}}
The former name of the city was '''Hengzhou''' ('''Hengchow''') ({{zh|labels=no|c={{linktext|衡州}} |p=Héngzhōu}}<ref>[http://www.larousse.fr/encyclopedie/ville/Hengyang/123568 Larousse Encyclopedie: HENGYANG]</ref>). This was the capital of a [[zhou (administrative division)|prefecture]] in the [[Tang dynasty]]'s [[Jiangnandao|Jiangnan]] and [[Jiangnanxidao|West Jiangnan]] [[circuit (administrative division)|circuit]]s. [[Li Jingxuan]] was banished to superintendence of Hengzhou after feigning an illness and attempting to usurp control of the [[Zhongshu Ling|legislative bureau]] at [[Chang'an]] against the [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Gaozong Emperor]]'s wishes in AD 680. Following the AD 705 coup that removed the Empress [[Wu Zetian]] from power, her ally [[Li Jiongxiu]] was also briefly demoted to superintendence of this province. During the reign of [[Emperor Muzong of Tang|Emperor Muzong]], the chancellor [[Linghu Chu]] was also demoted to this province for his underlings' alleged corruption.

In the 750s, the superintendent of Hengzhou [[Chen Xi'ang]] not only ruled his own region but also used his private army to dominate his nominal superior, the military governor [[Zhang Weiyi]] headquartered in [[Jingzhou (ancient China)|Jing Prefecture]] (modern [[Jingzhou]]). Upon Zhang's replacement by the former chancellor [[Lü Yin]] in 760, however, Chen was placated and then killed in a surprise attack.

During the reign of the Tang emperor [[Emperor Xizong of Tang|Xizong]], [[Zhou Yue]] overthrew first the prefect of Hengzhou [[Xu Hao]] in 881 and then the agent of the rebel [[Qin Zongquan]] in the capital of the [[Qinhua Circuit]] at [[Tanzhou (in modern Hunan)|Tan Prefecture]] (modern [[Changsha]]) in 886. Xizong confirmed Zhou Yue in all his posts, renaming his circuit [[Wu'an Circuit|Wu'an]]. Xizong's brother then gave him additional authority over [[West Lingnan Circuit]] (modern [[Guangxi]]). Shortly after, in 893, [[Deng Chune]] and [[Lei Man]] attacked and killed him.

Other superintendents included [[Qi Ying]] and [[Xiao Ye]].

After initially falling to agrarian rebels under [[Yang Shiyuan]], Hengzhou was recovered by the lord of Wu'an [[Ma Yin]] and formed part of his power base during the collapse of the Tang. He initially supported the [[Later Liang (Five Dynasties)|Later Liang]], then declared himself king ([[Ma Chu]]) in his own right during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].

During the [[Revolt of the Three Feudatories]], [[Wu Sangui]] declared himself Emperor of the [[Great Zhou dynasty|Great Zhou]] and established an imperial court at Hengzhou in 1678 before dying of illness later that year. His grandson [[Wu Shifan]] then retreated to [[Yunnan]], and the Qing recovered Hengzhou the next year.

The [[Defense of Hengyang|Battle of Hengyang]] was the longest defense of a single city during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. When Changsha fell to the Imperial Japanese Army on June 19, 1944, Hengyang became their next target. The reorganized [[Eleventh Army (Japan)|11th Army]], consisting of 10 divisions, four brigades, and over 110,000 men, assumed the task of attacking Hengyang. It was part of the Japanese [[Operation Ichi-Go|Ichi-Go offensive]].

A [[Roman Catholic diocese of Hengzhou]] was established, although periodically suppressed. This was suffragan to the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Changsha|Archbishop of Changsha]] following its elevation in 1946.

In 2013 Hengyang was the center of a major [[vote buying]] scandal where it was found that 56 officials were founded to be complicit in paying lower level local officials for votes. The 56 were subsequently removed from office, and an additional 512 resigned from their positions.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-resign/lawmakers-in-chinese-city-resign-in-mass-bribery-case-idUSBRE9BR04620131228| title = Lawmakers in Chinese city resign in mass bribery case| website = [[Reuters]]}}</ref>

==Economy==
{{Unreferencedsect|date=August 2024}}
Hengyang has an area of {{convert|15,279|km2|abbr=on}} and a population of 7,141,162. There are 1,075,516 people in the built-up area of {{convert|522|km2|abbr=on}} in the four central urban districts. Hengyang is a busy and growing industrial City and the leading transportation centre of [[Hunan]], linking water, rail, and highway routes. Manufacturing includes: chemicals, agricultural, mining equipment, textiles, paper and processed foods. Lead, zinc, coal, and tin are mined nearby. Hengyang is the second largest city in Hunan province, and is a growing industrial hub and transportation center.

==Tourism==
Known as the 'Bright Pearl in [[Southern China]]' and as 'Wild Goose City' (the latter because of wild [[Goose|geese]] that used to rest here while flying south for the winter), Hengyang has been the birthplace of many historical figures, such the revolutionist [[Luo Ronghuan]]<ref>[http://www.luopan.com/ci/h/en_US/421000.html Luopan. Hengyang Details] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215075428/http://luopan.com/ci/h/en_US/421000.html |date=2010-12-15 }}</ref> and a noted [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] scholar [[Wang Fuzhi]]. The city was badly damaged during [[World War II]]<ref>[http://www.accci.com.au/keycity/hunan.htm The Australia-China Chamber of Commerce and Industry of New South Wales HUNAN PROVINCE]</ref> and few historical buildings survive in diverse stage of reconstruction, including Shigu Academy, Dragon Tower, [[Confucianism|Confucian]] School on the Dongzhou Island ({{lang|zh-Hans|东洲岛}}), Laiyan Pagoda and [[Nantai Temple]]. [[Mount Heng (Hunan)|Mount Heng]], one of the [[Five Sacred Mountains]], lies 45 kilometres north from the city proper.

==Climate==
Hengyang has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with four distinct seasons. Spring is subject to heavy rainfall, while the summers are long, hot, and humid with lesser rainfall, and autumn is comfortable and rather dry. Winter is rather brief, but cold snaps occur with temperatures occasionally dropping below freezing, and while not heavy, rain can be frequent. The monthly daily mean temperature ranges from {{convert|6.0|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|29.8|°C}} in July.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-03-15 |title=衡阳气候 |trans-title=climate in Hengyang |url=https://www.hengyang.gov.cn/hyly/hygk/zrdl/20200111/i45672.html |access-date=2024-05-25 |website=PEOPLE'S GOVERNMENT OF HENGYAN |language=zh}}</ref>
