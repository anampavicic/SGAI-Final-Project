Formerly a [[Provinces of China|province]], Guangxi became an autonomous region in 1958. Its current capital is [[Nanning]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F8TjAAAAMAAJ&q=nanning+city|title=The Yearbook of China's Cities|date=2006|publisher=Yearbook of China's Cities Publishing House|pages=327}}</ref>

Guangxi's location, in mountainous terrain in the far south of China, has placed it on the frontier of Chinese civilization throughout much of [[History of China|Chinese history]]. The current name "Guang" means "expanse" and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in 226 AD. It was given [[Administrative divisions of the Yuan dynasty|provincial level status]] during the [[Yuan dynasty]], but even into the 20th century, it was considered an open, wild territory. The abbreviation of the region is "{{zh |c = {{linktext|桂}} |labels = no }}" ([[Hanyu pinyin]]: {{transliteration|zh|Guì}}; Zhuang: {{lang|za|Gvei}}), which comes from the name of the city of [[Guilin]], the provincial capital during both the [[Ming dynasty]] and the [[Qing dynasty]].

Guangxi contains the largest population of China's ethnic minorities after [[Yunnan]], in particular, the [[Zhuang people]], who make up 34% of the population. Various regional languages and dialects such as [[Pinghua]], [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]], [[Kam language|Kam]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[Min Chinese|Min]] are spoken alongside [[Mandarin Chinese]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chinadiscovery.com/ethnic-minority-culture-tour/guangxi-minorities.html|title=Zhuang Minority & Yao Minority in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region|website=www.chinadiscovery.com|access-date=11 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913222806/http://www.chinadiscovery.com/ethnic-minority-culture-tour/guangxi-minorities.html|archive-date=13 September 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Name ==
"{{lang|zh-Latn|Guǎng}}" ({{zh|t=廣|s=广}}) means 'expanse' or 'vast', and has been associated with the region since the creation of Guang Prefecture in AD 226.<ref>{{cite book |title=Regional China: A Business and Economic Handbook |year=2013 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |author=Rongxing Gao |page=77 |isbn=9781137287670}}</ref> Guangxi and neighboring [[Guangdong]] literally mean 'expanse west' and 'expanse east'.

During the [[Song dynasty]], the Two Guangs were formally separated as {{lang|zh-Latn|Guǎngnán Xīlù}} ({{zh|first=t|t=廣南西路|s=广南西路|l=vast south west region |labels=no}}) and {{lang|zh-Latn|Guǎngnán Dōnglù}} ({{zh|first=t|t=廣南東路|s=广南东路|l=vast south east region |labels=no}}), which became abbreviated as {{lang|zh-Latn|Guǎngxī Lù}} ({{zh|first=t|t=廣西路|s=广西路 |labels=no}}) and {{lang|zh-Latn|Guǎngdōng Lù}} ({{zh|first=t|t=廣東路|s=广东路 |labels=no}}).

Guangxi was also previously spelled as ''Kwangsi'' in [[Chinese postal romanization|postal]] and [[Wade–Giles]] romanizations. The spelling of the province was replaced by the pinyin spelling of ''Guangxi'' in 1958 and has been widely used internationally after 1986.{{cn|date=July 2024}} The official name was also known as ''Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region'' in a number of Western publications outside of China published in the 1950s to 1970s.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-11 |title=0288 - The Kwangsi Chuang Autonomous Region, a major rice growing area in S...Back |url=https://archive.sacu.org/archive/photo-cards/blue-box/n/1960650-0288-the-kwangsi-chuang-autonomous-region-a-major-rice-growing-area-in-sback |access-date=2024-07-15 |website=Society for Anglo-Chinese Understanding |language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
{{More citations needed section|date=September 2021}}
Originally inhabited by a mixture of tribal groups known to the Chinese as the [[Baiyue]] ("Hundred Yue", {{langx|vi|Bách Việt}}), the region first became part of China during the [[Qin dynasty]]. In 214 BC, the [[Han Chinese]] general [[Zhao Tuo]] ({{langx|vi|Triệu Đà}}) claimed most of southern China for [[Qin Shi Huang]] before the emperor's death. The ensuing civil war permitted Zhao to establish a separate kingdom at [[Panyu District|Panyu]] known as [[Nanyue]] ("Southern Yue"). Alternatively submissive to and independent of [[Han dynasty]] control, Southern Yue expanded colonization and [[sinicization]] under its policy of "Harmonizing and Gathering the Hundred Yue" ({{lang|zh|和集百越}}) until [[Han–Nanyue War|its collapse in 111 BC]] during the [[southward expansion of the Han dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tracing Bai-Yue Ancestry in Aboriginal Li People on Hainan Island |url=https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/10/msac210/6731089 |access-date=2023-01-23 |website=academic.oup.com}}</ref>

The name "Guangxi" can be traced to the "Expansive" or "Wide" province ({{lang|zh-Hant|廣州}}) of the [[Eastern Wu]], which controlled southeastern China during the [[Three Kingdoms]] period. [[Guilin Commandery|Guilin]] formed one of its commanderies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Under the [[Tang dynasty]], the Zhuang moved to support [[Piluoge]]'s kingdom of [[Nanzhao]] in [[Yunnan]], which successfully repulsed imperial armies in 751 and 754. Guangxi was then divided into an area of Zhuang ascendancy west of Nanning and an area of Han ascendancy east of Nanning.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

After the collapse of the Southern Zhao, [[Liu Yan (emperor)|Liu Yan]] established the [[Southern Han]] (Nanhan) in Xingwangfu (modern [[Guangdong]]). Although this state gained minimal control over Guangxi, it was plagued by instability and annexed by the [[Song dynasty]] in 971. The name "Guangxi" itself can be traced to the Song, who administered the area as the Guangnanxi ("West Southern Expanse"<!--NOT "Southwestern Expanse" ("xinan" in Chinese)-->) [[Circuit (administrative division)|Circuit]]. Harassed by both Song and the [[Jiaozhi]] in modern [[Vietnam]], the Zhuang leader [[Nong Zhigao]] led a revolt in 1052 for which he is still remembered by the Zhuang people. His independent kingdom was short-lived, however, and the tattooed Song general [[Di Qing]] returned Guangxi to China.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The [[Yuan dynasty]] established control over Yunnan during its conquest of the [[Dali Kingdom]] in 1253 and eliminated the [[Southern Song]] following the [[Battle of Yamen]] in 1279. Rather than ruling [[Lingnan]] as a subject territory or military district, the Mongolians then established Guangxi ("Western Expanse") as a proper province. The area nonetheless continued to be unruly, leading the [[Ming dynasty]] to employ the different local groups against one another. At the [[Battle of Big Rattan Gorge]] between the Zhuang and the [[Yao people|Yao]] in 1465, 20,000 deaths were reported.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

During the Ming and Qing dynasties, parts of Guangxi were ruled by the powerful [[Cen (surname)|Cen]] ({{lang|zh|岑}}) clan. The Cen were of Zhuang ethnicity and were recognized as ''[[tusi]]'' or local rulers by the Chinese emperors.

The [[Qing dynasty]] left the region alone until the imposition of direct rule in 1726, but the 19th century was one of constant unrest. A [[Yao people|Yao]] revolt in 1831 was followed by the [[Jintian Uprising]], the beginning of the [[Taiping Rebellion]], in January 1851 and the [[Da Cheng Rebellion]] in April 1854. The execution of St. [[Auguste Chapdelaine]] by local officials in Guangxi provoked the [[Second Opium War]] in 1858 and the legalization of foreign interference in the interior. Although [[Louis Brière de l'Isle]] was unable to invade its depot at [[Longzhou County|Longzhou]], the [[Guangxi Army]] saw a great deal of action in the 1884 [[Sino-French War]]. Largely ineffective within Vietnam, it was still able to repulse the French from China itself at the [[Battle of Bang Bo (Zhennan Pass)|Battle of Zhennan Pass]] (modern [[Friendship Pass]]) on 23 March 1885.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Following the [[Wuchang Uprising]], Guangxi seceded from the Qing Empire on 6 November 1911. The Qing governor, [[Shen Bingdan]], initially remained in place but was subsequently removed by a mutiny commanded by General [[Lu Rongting]]. General Lu's [[Old Guangxi clique]] overran [[Hunan]] and [[Guangdong]] as well and helped lead the [[National Protection War]] against [[Yuan Shikai]]'s attempt to re-establish an imperial government. Zhuang's loyalty made his [[Self-Government Army]] cohesive but reluctant to move far beyond its own provinces. Subsequent feuding with [[Sun Yat-sen]] led to defeat in the 1920 and 1921 [[Guangdong–Guangxi War]]. After a brief occupation by [[Chen Jiongming]]'s Cantonese forces, Guangxi fell into disunity and profound banditry for several years<ref>Bonavia, David. ''China's Warlords.'' New York: Oxford University Press. 1995. {{ISBN|0-19-586179-5}}.</ref> until [[Li Zongren]]'s [[Guangxi Pacification Army]] established the [[New Guangxi clique]] dominated by Li, [[Huang Shaohong]], and [[Bai Chongxi]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Successful action in Hunan against [[Wu Peifu]] led to the Zhuang GPA becoming known as the "Flying Army" and the "Army of Steel". After the death of Sun Yat-sen, Li also repulsed [[Tang Jiyao]]'s [[Yunnan–Guangxi War|revolt]] and joined the [[Northern Expedition]] establishing control over other warlords by the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. His was one of the few [[Kuomintang]] units free from serious [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP) influence and was therefore employed by [[Chiang Kai-shek]] for the [[Shanghai massacre of 1927]]. Within the People's Republic of China, Guangxi is also noted for the [[Baise Uprising]], a failed CCP revolt led by [[Chen Zhaoli]] and [[Deng Xiaoping]] in 1929.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Being in the far south, Guangxi did not fall during the [[Chinese Civil War]], but joined the People's Republic in December 1949, two months after its founding.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In 1952, a small section of Guangdong's coastline ([[Qinzhou]],  Lianzhou (now [[Hepu County]]), [[Fangchenggang]] and [[Beihai]]) was given to Guangxi, giving it access to the sea. This was reversed in 1955, and then restored in 1965.{{Citation needed|date=September 2021}}

The [[Han Chinese]] are the largest ethnic group in Guangxi. Han Chinese populations in Guangxi largely live along the autonomous region's southern coast and eastern portions.<ref name=":2" /> Of these, the main subgroups are those that speak [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] and [[Southwestern Mandarin]] varieties of [[Chinese language family|Chinese]]. Qinzhou and Goulou Yue are spoken in the southern and eastern regions, respectively. [[Pinghua]] is spoken in Nanning and Guilin.

The predominant religions in Guangxi among the [[Han Chinese]] are [[Chinese folk religion]]s, [[Taoism|Taoist traditions]] and [[Chinese Buddhism]]. The large [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] population mostly practices the [[Zhuang folk religion]] centered around the worship of their ancestral god ''Buluotuo'' (布洛陀). According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 40.48% of the population believes and is involved in [[Chinese ancestral religion|ancestor veneration]], while 0.26% of the population identifies as Christian.<ref name="Wang2015"/>

The reports did not give figures for other types of religion; 59.26% of the population may be either irreligious or involved in [[Chinese folk religion|worship of nature deities]], Buddhism, [[Confucianism]], Taoism, [[Chinese salvationist religions|folk religious sects]]. The [[Yao people|Yao]], another numerous ethnic group inhabiting the province, mostly practices a form of [[Yao Taoism|indigenised and conservative Taoism]].

Important crops in Guangxi include [[rice]], [[maize]] and [[sweet potato]]es. Cash crops include [[sugar cane]], [[peanut]]s, [[tobacco]], and [[kenaf]].

85&nbsp;percent of the world's [[star anise]] is grown in Guangxi. It is a major ingredient in the antiviral [[oseltamivir]].<ref>http://epaper.gxnews.com.cn/ngjb/html/2009–05/07/node_303.htm{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Guangxi is one of China's key production centers for nonferrous metals. The region holds approximately 1/3 of all [[tin]] and [[manganese]] deposits in China.<ref name="thechinaperspective.com">{{Cite web |url=http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/guangxi-zhuang-autonomous-region/ |title=Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region: Economic News and Statistics for Guangxi's Economy |access-date=1 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008045310/http://thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/guangxi-zhuang-autonomous-region/ |archive-date=8 October 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Liuzhou is the main industrial center and a major motor vehicle manufacturing center. [[General Motors]] have a manufacturing base here in a joint venture as [[SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile]]. The city also has a large steel factory and several related industries.  The local government of Guangxi hopes to expand the region's manufacturing sector, and during the drafting of China's Five Year Plan in 2011, earmarked 2.6 trillion RMB for investment in the region's Beibu Gulf Economic Zone(See Below).<ref name="thechinaperspective.com"/>

In recent years Guangxi's economy has languished behind that of its wealthy neighbor and twin, [[Guangdong]]. Guangxi's 2017 [[nominal GDP]] was about 2039.63 billion yuan (US$302.09 billion) and ranked 17th in China. Its [[per capita GDP]] was 38,102 yuan (US$5,770).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ceicdata.com/en/china/gross-domestic-product-per-capita/gross-domestic-product-per-capita-guangxi|title = Gross Domestic Product (GDP): Per Capita: Guangxi &#124; Economic Indicators &#124; CEIC}}</ref>

Due to its lack of a major manufacturing industry in comparison to other provincial-level regions, Guangxi is the fourth most energy efficient provincial-level region in China, helping to further boost its green image.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/guangxi-zhuang-autonomous-region |title=The China Perspective {{!}} Guangxi Economic and Industry Profile/ |access-date=27 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602033236/http://www.thechinaperspective.com/topics/province/guangxi-zhuang-autonomous-region/ |archive-date=2 June 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

=== Investment ===
Seventy-one Taiwanese ventures started up in Guangxi in 2007, with contracts bringing up to US$149 million of investment, while gross exports surpassed US$1 billion. There are a total of 1182 Taiwan ventures in Guangxi, and by the end of 2006, they have brought a total of US$4.27 billion of investment into the autonomous region. During the first half of 2007, 43 projects worthy of RMB2.6 billion (US$342 million) have already been contracted between Guangxi and Taiwan investors. Cooperation between Guangxi and Taiwan companies mainly relates to manufacturing, high-tech electronic industries, agriculture, energy resources, and tourism.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== Power ===
Guangxi Power Grid invested 180 million yuan in 2007 in projects to bring power to areas that still lacked access to [[electricity]]. The areas affected include [[Nanning]], [[Hechi]], [[Bose, Guangxi|Bose]] and [[Guigang]]. Around 125,000 people have gained access to electricity. The money has been used to build or alter 738 10-kilovolt distribution units with a total length of wire reaching 1,831.8 kilometers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Due to a lack of investment in construction in the [[power grid]] net in rural areas, more than 400 villages in Guangxi Province were not included in the projects. Around 500,000 cannot participate in the policy known as "The Same Grid, the Same Price". Guangxi Power Grid will invest 4.6 billion yuan in improving the power grid during the 11th Five Year Plan.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Guangxi Power Grid invested 2.5 billion yuan in building an electric power system in the first half of 2007. Of the total investment, 2.3 billion yuan has been put into the project of the main power grid. So far, four new transformer substations in Guangxi are in various stages of completion. Wenfu substation went into operation in the city of Hechi in January 2007, and since then it has become a major hub of the electrical power system of the surrounding three counties. When the Cangwu substation was completed, it doubled the local transformer capacity. In June 2007, the new substation in Chongzuo passed its operation tests. And in the same month, Qiulong commenced production too.

{{see also|Beibu Gulf Economic Rim}}

In late February 2008, the central government approved China's first international and regional economic cooperation zone in Guangxi. The construction of the [[Beibu Gulf Economic Zone]] began in 2006. With the approval, the Beibu Gulf Economic Zone will be formally incorporated into national development strategies.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The Beibu Gulf Economic Zone covers six coastal cities along the [[Beibu Gulf]]. It integrates the cities of [[Nanning]], the region's capital, [[Beihai]], [[Qinzhou]], [[Fangchenggang]], [[Chongzuo]] and [[Yulin, Guangxi|Yulin]]. The state will adopt policies and measures to support mechanism innovation, rational industry layout, and infrastructure construction in the Beibu Gulf Economic Zone.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Guangxi has pledged a 100 billion yuan (US$14 billion) investment over the next five years{{when|date=July 2014}} for building and repairing {{convert|2500|km|abbr=on}} railways to form a network hub in the area. Beibu Gulf Zone will serve as the [[logistics]] base, business base, processing and manufacturing base, and information exchange center for China-[[ASEAN]] cooperation. Beibu Gulf Zone promises broad prospects for further development and its growth potential is rapidly released. But the shortage of talent and professionals in [[petrochemicals]], [[iron]] and [[steel]], [[electricity]], [[finance]], [[tourism]], [[port planning]], logistics and [[marine (ocean)|marine]] industries are bottlenecks.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

The regional government is also working on speeding up key cooperation projects including [[Transport in the People's Republic of China|transportation]], the marine industry, agriculture, forestry, fisheries, energy development, cross-border tourism, and environmental protection. Beibu Gulf has already attracted several major projects such as Qinzhou [[oil refinery]] projects and [[Stora Enso]], a [[Fortune 500]] forest products company based in [[Finland]]. In January 2008 trade import and export in the Beibu Gulf zone exceeded US$1.3 billion, a record high.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

=== Bauxite reserves ===
In September 2007, China's [[Ministry of Commerce of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Commerce]] said that it has found 120 million tons of new [[bauxite]] reserves in Guangxi. The ministry said that the new reserves, which are located in [[Chongzhou]] in the southern region of [[Youjiang]], have very high-quality bauxite, a raw material for making [[aluminum]]. Currently, the proven reserves of bauxite in Guangxi are about 1 billion tons, making the province one of the country's biggest bauxite sources.

===Rail===
[[File:DF7D Train 2304.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Guizhou–Guangxi Railway]] near the Layi Station in [[Nandan County]], [[Hechi]].]]
The [[Hunan–Guangxi Railway|Hunan–Guangxi Railway (Xianggui Line)]], which bisects the autonomous region diagonally from [[Quanzhou County|Quanzhou]] in the northeast on the border with [[Hunan]] to [[Pingxiang, Guangxi|Pingxiang]] in the southwest on the border with [[Vietnam]], passes through Guangxi's three principal cities, [[Nanning]], [[Liuzhou]] and [[Guilin]].  Most other railways in Guangxi are connected to the Xianggui Line.

From Nanning, the [[Nanning–Kunming Railway]] heads west through [[Baise]] to [[Kunming]], [[Yunnan]] and the Nanning–Fangchenggang Railway runs south to [[Qinzhou]], [[Fangchenggang]] and [[Beihai]] on the coast.  From Liuzhou, the [[Guizhou–Guangxi Railway]] extends northwestward through [[Hechi]] to [[Guizhou]] and the [[Jiaozuo–Liuzhou Railway]] runs due north to [[Hunan]], and eventually [[Hubei]] and [[Henan]] in [[South Central China|central China]].  From [[Litang, Guangxi|Litang Township]] on the Xianggui Line between Nanning and Liuzhou, the [[Litang–Qinzhou Railway]] runs south to [[Qinzhou]] on the coast and the [[Litang–Zhanjiang Railway|Litang–Zhanjiang Railway (Lizhan Line)]] extends southeastward through [[Guigang]] and [[Yulin, Guangxi|Yulin]] to [[Zhanjiang]], [[Guangdong]].

The [[Luoyang–Zhanjiang Railway|Luoyang–Zhanjiang Railway (Luozhan Line)]], which intersects with the Xianggui Line on the Hunan side of the border at [[Yongzhou]], runs south through [[Hezhou]] and [[Wuzhou]] in eastern Guangxi and joins the Lizhan Line at Yulin.  At [[Cenxi]], a branch of the Luozhan Line heads east to [[Maoming]], Guangdong, forming a second rail outlet from Guangxi to Guangdong.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Lingnan culture|Zhuang customs and culture}}
[[File:Pagodas en el lago Shanhu guilin.jpg|thumb|Pagodas in [[Guilin]].]]
"Guangxi" and neighbouring [[Guangdong]] literally mean "Western Expanse" and "Eastern Expanse". Together, Guangdong and Guangxi are called the "Two Expanses" ({{zh|s=两广|t=兩廣|y= leung6 gwong1| links=no|p= [[Liǎngguǎng]]}}).

Its culture and language are reflected in this. Though now associated with the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] ethnic minority, Guangxi's culture traditionally has had a close connection with Cantonese. Cantonese culture and language followed the Xi River valley from Guangdong and are still predominant in the eastern half of Guangxi today. Outside of this area, there is a huge variety of ethnicities and language groups represented.

Guangxi is known for its ethnolinguistic diversity. In the capital of [[Nanning]], for example, three varieties of Chinese are spoken locally: [[Southwestern Mandarin]], [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (specifically [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]]), and [[Pinghua]], in addition to various [[Zhuang languages]] and others.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Guangxi cuisine}}
Guangxi cuisine is known as {{zh|s=桂菜|p= guìcài}} however it is not as affluent as its more known neighbours like [[Sichuan cuisine|Sichuan]], [[Hunan cuisine|Hunan]] or [[Cantonese cuisine|Guangdong]]. Much of Guangxi's local cuisine is centered around the cuisine of its ethnic minorities. This includes the more well known [[Luosifen|Luosifen soup]], {{zh|s=桂林米粉|p= guìlín mǐfěn}} and a variety of pickled dishes.

== Tourism ==

The major tourist attraction of Guangxi is [[Guilin]], a city famed across China and the world for its spectacular setting by the [[Li River (Guangxi)|Li Jiang]] (Li River) among [[karst]] peaks. It also used to be the capital of Guangxi and [[Jingjiang Princes' City]], the old princes' residence, is open to the public. South of Guilin down the river is the town of [[Yangshuo]], which has become a favourite destination for foreign tourists.

The variety of visible cultures in Guangxi, such as the [[Zhuang people|Zhuang]] and [[Dong people|Dong]], are also a draw for tourists. The northern part of the region, bordering [[Guizhou]], is home to the [[Longsheng Rice Terrace]]s, some of the steepest in the world. Nearby is [[Sanjiang Dong Autonomous County]].

Many Chinese tourists visiting Nanning also visit [[Ban Gioc–Detian Falls]] on the China-Vietnam border.
