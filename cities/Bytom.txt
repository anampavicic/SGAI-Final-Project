'''Bytom''' (<small>Polish pronunciation:</small> {{IPAc-pl|AUD|Pl-Bytom.ogg|'|b|y|t|o|m}}; [[Silesian language|Silesian]]: ''Bytōm, Bytōń'', {{langx|de|Beuthen O.S.}}) is a city in [[Upper Silesia]], in southern [[Poland]]. Located in the [[Silesian Voivodeship]] of Poland, the city is 7&nbsp;km northwest of [[Katowice]], the regional capital.

It is one of the oldest cities in the [[Upper Silesia]], and the former seat of the [[Silesian Piasts|Piast dukes]] of the [[Duchy of Bytom]]. Until 1532, it was in the hands of the [[Piast dynasty]], then it belonged to the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]]. After 1623 it was a [[state country]] in the hands of [[Henckel von Donnersmarck|the Donnersmarck family]]. From 1742 to 1945 the town was within the borders of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and [[Germany]], and played an important role as an economic and administrative centre of the [[Katowice urban area|local industrial region]]. Until the outbreak of [[World War II]], it was the main centre of national, social, cultural and publishing organisations fighting to preserve Polish identity in [[Upper Silesia]]. In the interbellum and during World War II, local Poles and Jews faced persecution by Germany.

After the war, decades of the [[Polish People's Republic]] were characterized by a constant emphasis on the development of [[heavy industry]], which deeply polluted and degraded Bytom. After 1989, the city experienced a socio-economic decline. The population has also been rapidly declining since 1999. However, it is an important place in the cultural, entertainment, and industrial map of the region.

==Geology==
The bedrock of the Upland of [[:pl:Miechowice|Miechowice]] consists primarily of sandstones and slates. The rocks are punctuated with abundant natural resources of coal and iron ore from the Carboniferous period. In the north part of the upland, in the Bytom basin lays the broad range of the triassic rocks, from sandstones to limestones, with rich ore, zinc and lead reserves. The upper layer is composed of clay, sand and gravel.

==Coat of arms==
One half of the [[coat of arms of Bytom]] depicts a miner mining coal, while the other half presents a yellow eagle on the blue field – the symbol of [[Upper Silesia]].

==History==
[[File:Plackosciuszki.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tadeusz Kościuszko|Kosciuszko]] Square in the 1890s]]
Bytom is one of the oldest cities of [[Upper Silesia]], originally recorded as ''Bitom'' in 1136, when it was part of the Medieval [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]]. Archaeological discoveries have shown that there was a fortified settlement (a ''[[gród]]'') here, probably founded by the Polish King [[Bolesław I the Brave]] in the early 11th century.<ref>J. Kramer, ''Chronik der Stadt Beuthen in Ober-Schlesien'', Bytom, 1863, p. 1</ref>

After the [[Testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth|fragmentation of Poland]] in 1138, Bytom became part of the [[Seniorate Province]], as it was still considered part of historic [[Lesser Poland]]. In 1177 it became part of the [[Duchy of Silesia|Silesian]] province of Poland, and remained within historic [[Silesia]] since.<ref>Roman Majorczyk, ''Historia górnictwa kruszcowego w rejonie Bytomia'', Bytom, 1985, p. 9</ref> Bytom received [[city rights]] from Prince [[Władysław of Salzburg|Władysław]] in 1254 with its first centrally located market square. The city of Bytom benefited economically from its location on a trade route linking [[Kraków]] with Silesia from east to west, and [[Hungary]] with [[Moravia]] and [[Greater Poland]] from north to south. The first [[Roman Catholic]] Church of the Virgin Mary was built in 1231. In 1259 Bytom was raided by the [[Mongols]]. The Duchy of Opole was split and in 1281 Bytom became a [[Duchy of Bytom|separate duchy]], since 1289 under overlordship and administration of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]]. It existed until 1498, when it was re-integrated with the [[Piast dynasty|Piast]]-ruled [[Duchy of Opole]]. Due to German settlers coming to the area, the city was being [[Germanization|Germanized]].

It came under the control of the [[Habsburg monarchy]] of [[Austria]] in 1526, which increased the influence of the German language. In 1683, Polish King [[John III Sobieski]] and his wife Queen [[Marie Casimire Louise de La Grange d'Arquien|Marie Casimire]], visited the city, greeted by the townspeople and clergy, on the king's way to the [[Battle of Vienna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wilanow-palac.pl/jan_iii_sobieski_na_slasku_w_drodze_na_odsiecz_wiedniowi_roku_1683.html|title=Jan III Sobieski na Śląsku w drodze na odsiecz Wiedniowi roku 1683|website=Muzeum Pałacu Króla Jana III w Wilanowie|author=Paweł Freus|access-date=6 December 2020|language=pl}}</ref> The city became part of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1742 during the [[Silesian Wars]] and part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871. In the 19th and the first part of the 20th centuries, the city rapidly grew and industrialized.

Bytom was one of the main centers of Polish resistance against Germanization in Upper Silesia in the 19th century, up until the mid-20th century. Polish social, political and cultural organizations were formed and operated here. From 1848, the newspaper ''[[:pl:Dziennik Górnośląski|Dziennik Górnośląski]]'' was published here. Poles smuggled large amounts of gunpowder through the city to the [[Russian Partition]] of Poland during the [[January Uprising]] in 1863.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Pater|first=Mieczysław|year=1963|title=Wrocławskie echa powstania styczniowego|journal=Śląski Kwartalnik Historyczny Sobótka|language=pl|issue=4|page=418}}</ref> According to the Prussian census of 1905, the city of Beuthen had a population of 60,273, of which 59% spoke [[German language|German]], 38% spoke [[Polish language|Polish]] and 3% were bilingual.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Belzyt|first=Leszek|url=https://opacplus.bsb-muenchen.de/search?isbn|title=Sprachliche Minderheiten im preussischen Staat: 1815 - 1914 ; die preußische Sprachenstatistik in Bearbeitung und Kommentar|date=1998|publisher=Herder-Inst.|isbn=978-3-87969-267-5|location=Marburg}}{{Dead link|date=November 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1895, the [[Polish Sokół movement|"Sokół" Polish Gymnastic Society]] was established, and, during the [[Silesian uprisings]], in 1919–1920, Polish football clubs [[Szombierki Bytom|Poniatowski Szombierki]] and [[Polonia Bytom]] were founded, which later on, in post-[[World War II]] Poland both won the national championship. After [[World War I]], in the [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|Upper Silesian plebiscite]] of 1921, 74.7% of the votes in Beuthen city were for [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], and 25.3% were for [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], due to which it remained in Germany, as part of the [[Province of Upper Silesia]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Aktuelle News, Schlagzeilen und Berichte aus aller Welt - Arcor.de|url=https://www.arcor.de/|access-date=2020-12-18|website=www.arcor.de}}</ref> In the interwar period, Bytom was one of two cities (alongside [[Kwidzyn]]) in [[Weimar Germany|Germany]], in which a Polish gymnasium was allowed to operate.

During the German [[invasion of Poland]], which started [[World War II]], the Germans carried out mass arrests of local Poles. On September 1, 1939, the day of the outbreak of the war, Adam Bożek, the chairman of the Upper Silesian district of the Union of Poles in Germany, was arrested in Bytom and then deported to the [[Dachau concentration camp]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Wardzyńska|first=Maria|year=2009|title=Był rok 1939.

[[File:Agorabytom.jpg|thumb|Agora Bytom shopping centre]]
Trade is one of the main pillars of the economy of Bytom. Being a city with long traditions of commercial trade, Bytom is fulfilling its new [[postindustrial]] role. In the centre of Bytom, and mainly around Station Street and the Market Square, is the largest concentration of registered merchants in the county.

In 2007, Bytom and its neighbours created the Upper Silesian Metropolitan Union, the largest urban centre in Poland. The Union was superseded by [[Metropolis GZM]] in 2018.
