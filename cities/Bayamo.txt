'''Bayamo''' is the capital city of the [[Granma Province]] of [[Cuba]] and one of the largest cities in the [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] region.

==Overview==
The community of Bayamo lies on a plain by the Bayamo River. It is affected by the violent [[Bayamo (wind)|Bayamo wind]].

One of the most important education institutions in the province is the [[University of Granma]].

==History==
Established in 1513, Bayamo was the second of seven cities founded by [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Bayamo |volume=3 |pages=553–554 }}</ref> Francisco Iznaga,<ref>Jorge Iznaga. [http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&db=iznaga&id=I772 FRANCISCO IZNAGA] Iznaga Genealogy (IZNAGA - 1420 - Present), Retrieved 5 December 2012.</ref> a [[Basque people|Basque]] landowner in the western portion of Cuba during the first 30 years of the colonization of Cuba, was elected mayor in 1540. Iznaga was the originator of a powerful lineage that finally settled in [[Trinidad, Cuba|Trinidad]], where the Torre Iznaga (Iznaga Tower) is. His descendants fought for the independence of Cuba, from 1820 to 1900.

During much of the 16th century it was one of the most important agricultural and commercial settlements of the island. Its inland situation gave it relative security against the pirates who infested [[Caribbean|West Indian]] seas, and the misfortunes of [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]] were the fortunes of Bayamo. Down the [[Cauto River]], then open to the sea for vessels of 200 tons, and through [[Manzanillo, Cuba|Manzanillo]], Bayamo drove a thriving contraband trade that made it the leading town of Cuba at the opening of the 17th century.<ref name="EB1911"/>

A tremendous flood, in 1616, choked the Cauto with trees and wrecked vessels, cutting it off from direct access to the sea; but through Manzanillo it continued a great clandestine traffic with [[Curaçao]], [[Jamaica]], and other foreign islands throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. Bayamo was then surrounded by fine plantations.<ref name="EB1911"/>

In 1827 it acquired the status of [[city]]. In the [[Ten Years' War|war of 1868&ndash;1878]] it was an insurgent stronghold. One of the most desperate conflicts of the war was fought nearby, and it was nearly destroyed by the opposing parties.<ref name="EB1911"/>

==Demographics==
In 2022, the municipality of Bayamo had a population of 236,826.<ref name="citypopulation">{{Cite web |title=Cuba: Administrative Division (Provinces and Municipalities) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/cuba/admin/ |access-date=2024-02-03 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> With a total area of {{convert|918|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}},<ref name=statoids>{{Cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/ycu.html|title=Municipios of Cuba|author=Statoids|date=July 2003| access-date=2007-10-06| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071012141831/http://statoids.com/ycu.html| archive-date= 12 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> it has a [[population density]] of {{convert|242.0|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.

==Transportation==
Bayamo is an under-recognized world leader in sustainable transportation. Per a UN study only about 15% of commuters rely on motorized transport and almost three times as many (39%) rely on about 500 licensed horse-drawn carriages generally following fixed routes. The rest of the non-pedestrian traffic is bicycle and bicycle taxi.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mirror.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=1217&catid=147&typeid=6 |title=Getting the carriages out, Cuban-style |date=2004-07-20 |website=UN-HABITAT |access-date=2017-07-31 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731195702/http://mirror.unhabitat.org/content.asp?cid=1217&catid=147&typeid=6 |archive-date=2017-07-31 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author1=Jon Petrie |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/forums/americas-cuba/cuba/bayamo-an-unacknowledged-leader-in-horse-dependent-ecological-transport |title=Bayamo, an unacknowledged leader in horse dependent/ ecological transport |website=Lonely Planet |access-date=2017-07-31 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731195145/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/forums/americas-cuba/cuba/bayamo-an-unacknowledged-leader-in-horse-dependent-ecological-transport |archive-date=2017-07-31 }}</ref>
