==History==
{{cleanup|reason=Section uses British Raji Era sources that are considered unreliable in Wikipedia|date=April 2022}}
The early history of Hardoi is obscure.<ref name="Gazetteer">{{cite book |last1=Nevill |first1=H.R. |title=Hardoi - A Gazetteer |date=1904 |publisher=Government Press |location=Allahabad |pages=199-203 |url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.48076 |access-date=22 June 2021}}</ref> The name suggests a [[Bhar,]] a [[Dalit]] caste of [[Pasi (caste)|pasi]] origin, but tradition either attributes it to a [[Thathera]] ruler named Raja Harnakas or to a religious devotee named Hardeo Babar who supposedly lived here around 1000 CE.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> In any case, the site was inhabited from an early date; below the old town is an ancient ''[[Khera (archaeology)|khera]]'' that covers 16 acres.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> Around 1300, a group of [[Chamar|Chamar Gaurs]] led by [[Nir Singh]] are said to have conquered the place from the Thatheras, destroyed their fortress, and re-founded the city.<ref name="Gazetteer"/>

At the turn of the 20th century, Hardoi consisted of two distinct parts: "old" Hardoi, occupying the original site of the village, and "new" Hardoi, which was developed after the establishment of the British civil station in the late 1850s.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> "New" Hardoi had wide streets, well-shaded by trees, and consisted mostly of the homes of civil officials and members of the local bar, as well as shops.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> Victoria Hall, built in 1888, contained the municipal and district offices as well as a public library (with books in [[English language|English]], [[Urdu]], Hindi, [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic]], and [[Sanskrit]]) and a clock tower.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> The city also had a courthouse, police station, dispensary, orphanage, several schools, post and telegraph offices, and jail.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> Hardoi was not at the time a major commercial centre; the main trade involved gathering grain from the rural parts of the district and then exporting it by rail.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> There was a [[grain trade|grain market]] at Railwayganj, by the train station, while the main market was at Hardeoganj, which held bazaars on Sundays and Wednesdays.<ref name="Gazetteer"/> The [[Gibsonganj]] quarter, near [[Railwayganj]], had a colony of carpenters who did "extensive business in plough handles, cart wheels, and other portions of country carts."<ref name="Gazetteer"/>
