'''Khánh Hòa''' is a southern coastal [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[South Central Coast]] region, the [[Central Vietnam|Central]] of [[Vietnam]]. It borders [[Phú Yên]] to the north, [[Ninh Thuận]] to the south, [[Đắk Lắk]] to the west, [[Lâm Đồng]] to the southwest and the [[South China Sea]] to the east.

Khánh Hòa has a population of 1,147,000<!--<ref name="GSO09"/>-->{{sfn|Statistical data}} and spans an area of {{Convert|5199.62|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="area_2022"/> Its capital is [[Nha Trang]]. Khánh Hòa is the site of [[Bảo Đại]]'s summer home, the [[Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang]], the Institute of Oceanography, the Institute of Vaccines and Biological Substances. [[Cam Ranh Bay]] port is on land closest to a deep sea drop in Vietnam - the best site for [[submarine]] bases in Vietnam. An ancient temple of [[Champa]] is on the north side of Nha Trang.

==History==
Its name '''Khánh-hòa''' is inherently a Hanese phonetic way of [[Kauthara]], a Cham [[mandala]] once existed in the region.

The site of what is now Khánh Hòa had been within the territory of the [[Champa]] Kingdom before it was annexed to Annam territory. In 1653, one of the [[Nguyễn lords]], [[Nguyễn Phúc Tần]], sent his troops to occupy [[Phan Rang]]. The Champa king [[Bà Tấm]] surrendered to Nguyễn's troops and ceded an area from the east of the [[Phan Rang River]] to [[Phú Yên]] to the Nguyễn lord. The Nguyễn lord accepted the ceded territory and set up the Thái Khang garrison and divided it into two districts: Thái Khang and Diên Ninh.

[[File:Province de Khanh-Hoa (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Khanh Hoa province in 1909]]
[[File:Bản vẽ thành Khánh Hòa hay còn gọi là thành Diên Khánh, Khánh Hòa.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Khánh Hòa citadel]]
When [[Jean-Louis Taberd]] published the map of Annam in 1838, the province was named "Bình Hòa Trấn," with "Trấn" meaning "Department" or province.{{sfn|Meinheit|2016}}
In 1832, under the rule of Emperor [[Minh Mạng]], this area was renamed Khánh Hòa and was divided into two districts, Phủ Diên Khánh and Phủ Ninh Hòa, which between them had a total of four counties: Phước Điền and Vĩnh Xương counties; and Quảng Phước and Tân Định counties, respectively.

Under [[French Indochina]], the provincial capital was located in Diên Khánh Citadel, but it was relocated to Nha Trang in 1945.

During the [[Vietnam War]], Khánh Hòa was a hub of military activity for the [[Republic of Vietnam]] army ([[ARVN]]), the [[Republic of Vietnam Navy]], the [[Republic of Vietnam Air Force]], and for the U.S. [[Pacific Air Forces]] (USAF), particularly in [[Cam Ranh Bay]] and at the [[Nha Trang Air Base]]. The II Corp. headquarters were located in Nha Trang and populated by general and field officers, intelligence groups and ARVN liaisons.

After the communists' victory and the [[Fall of Saigon]] on April 30, 1975, the communist regime merged two provinces, [[Phú Yên]] and Khánh Hòa, into Phú Khánh province on 29 October 1975. In 1977, Nha Trang was upgraded to city status. In 1982, the [[National Assembly of Vietnam|National Assembly]] decided to incorporate the [[Spratly Islands]] into Phú Khánh province. On June 30, 1989, the National Assembly reversed its previous decision and split Phú Khánh province into two provinces as they were before.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Suối_Ba_Hồ_25.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ba Hồ stream in Khánh Hòa province]]
Khánh Hòa province has an area of {{cvt|5,197|sqkm}}. Its geographical coordinates are 108°40’33" to 109°27’55" E and 11°42’50" to 12°52’15" N.

The provincial coastline spreads from Đại Lãnh Commune to the end of [[Cam Ranh Bay]] with {{cvt|385|km}} of coastline featuring numerous creek mouths, lagoons, river mouths, and hundreds of islands and islets. The province also administers large territorial waters. The [[Spratly Islands]] are part of the province's Trường Sa District. The coastline is indented by several bays, most notably the four bays of [[Vân Phong Bay]], [[Nha Phu Bay]], [[Nha Trang Bay]] (Cù Huân) and [[Cam Ranh Bay]], of which Cam Ranh Bay with an area of around {{cvt|200.|sqkm}}, encompassed by a mountain range, is regarded as one of the three best natural seaports in the world. Cam Ranh Bay is strategically important and has been used as a naval base by several major powers throughout history.

[[Hòn Đôi Cliff]] (Mũi Hòn Đôi) on the [[Hòn Gốm Peninsula]] in [[Vạn Ninh District]] is the easternmost tip of Vietnam's mainland.

The province is mostly mountainous. The highest peak is Vọng Phu Mountain ({{cvt|2051|m}}) at the border of [[Đắk Lắk province]].<ref name=Atlat>''Atlat địa lí Việt Nam : dùng trong các trường phổ thông'' (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam). NXB Giao Duc, Hanoi: 2010</ref> The only large lowland area is located around [[Ninh Hòa]] in the north of the province.<ref name=Atlat/> Partly as a result of this, not much land is available for agriculture. {{cvt|87,100.|ha}} or 16.7% of Khánh Hòa's total area are used for farming, one of the lowest shares in the [[South Central Coast]].<ref name="GSO09">General Statistics Office (2009): Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 provinces and Cities, Vietnam. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref>{{sfn|Statistical data}} Forests cover more than half of the province's area.<!--<ref name="GSO09"/>-->{{sfn|Statistical data}}

The province enjoys a mild climate with an average annual temperature of {{cvt|26.7|°C}}. There are two distinct seasons: the rainy season lasts from April to December, with the other months being the dry season, except in [[Nha Trang]] where the rainy season lasts for just two months. The average relative humidity is 80.5%. The climate on the summit of Hòn Bà Mountain (located {{cvt|30|km}} from Nha Trang) features a climate like that of [[Đà Lạt]] and [[Sa Pa (town)|Sa Pa]].

==Demographics==
{{As of|2007}}, the province had a population of 1.147 million,<ref name="GSO09"/> of which the majority are ''Kinh'' or [[Vietnamese people]], the dominant ethnic group in Vietnam. [[Minority group]]s dwelling in the province are the [[Cham people|Cham]], [[Raglai people]], the "Overseas [[Chinese people|Chinese]]" [[Hoa people]], and the Austroasiatic-speaking [[Koho people]].

Khánh Hòa had an urban population of 466,500 people or 40.7% of the total in 2007, making it the most urbanized province of the [[South Central Coast]]. The average population growth per year between 2000 and 2007 was 1.26%, close to the average of the region. Growth was particularly strong in urban areas (2.24%).<ref name=GSO09calc>calculations based on General Statistics Office (2009): Socio-economical Statistical Data of 63 provinces and Cities. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
Khánh Hòa is subdivided into nine district-level sub-divisions:

* 6 districts:
{{div col}}
** [[Cam Lâm District|Cam Lâm]]
** [[Diên Khánh District|Diên Khánh]]
** [[Khánh Sơn District|Khánh Sơn]]
** [[Khánh Vĩnh District|Khánh Vĩnh]]
** [[Truong Sa District|Trường Sa]] (also known as the [[Spratly Islands]])<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ws1.khanhhoa.gov.vn/DataUbtE/2006-04-11-9AB307353B6A128A4725714D0006393C/TruongSa(Eng).htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120312213612/http://ws1.khanhhoa.gov.vn/DataUbtE/2006-04-11-9AB307353B6A128A4725714D0006393C/TruongSa(Eng).htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-03-12 |title=Spratley Islands District |publisher=Khanh Hoa provincial government website }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cpv.org.vn/cpv/Modules/News_English/News_Detail_E.aspx?CN_ID=459094&CO_ID=30107 |title=NA candidates meet voters in Spratly Islands |newspaper=Communist Party of Vietnam Online Newspaper |date=May 12, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929021304/http://www.cpv.org.vn/cpv/Modules/News_English/News_Detail_E.aspx?CN_ID=459094&CO_ID=30107 |archive-date=September 29, 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/Pages/PrintView.aspx?ArticleID=202647 |title=Teacher overcomes privation on Spratlys |date=August 17, 2010 |author=Thanh Ha |newspaper=VietNam News] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100908042124/http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/Pages/PrintView.aspx?ArticleID=202647 |archive-date=September 8, 2010 }}</ref>

{{div col end}}

They are further subdivided into six commune-level towns (or townlets), 99 communes, and 35 wards.

==Economy==
With a GDP per capita of 16.1 million [[VND]] (2007), Khánh Hòa is economically the most developed province of central Vietnam (after [[Da Nang]]).<ref name=GSO09calc/> It has a relatively small agricultural sector, but strong industry and services. The province is endowed with beautiful natural landscapes and beaches, which (together with its Cham heritage) attracts a large number of tourists. Khánh Hòa has had a significant trade surplus in recent years, with exports in 2007 of US$503.3 million and imports of US$222.5 million.<ref name=GSO09/>

===Agriculture, forestry, fishing===
Given its lack of flat land, Khánh Hòa has a relatively small agricultural sector. Rice harvests are among the lowest in the [[Nam Trung Bộ|South Central Coast]] with 188,500t in 2007. However, its output of sugar cane (738,200t in 2007, 4.25% of the national figure) and cashew nuts (5,238t, 1.74%) are more significant.<ref name=GSO09calc/>

Khánh Hòa is one of the few provinces with a higher [[gross output]] in fishing than in agriculture.<ref name=GSO09/> This is mostly due to the large number of aquaculture farms in the province, which make up around two thirds of the fishing output.

===Industry===
[[Nha Trang]] is the [[South Central Coast]]'s second largest industrial center<ref name=Atlat/> and the province in general accounts for more than one fifth of the region's industrial GDP.<ref name=GSO09calc/> Food processing industries are large, especially those processing local fishing products and food for shrimp farms. Other industrial sectors produce beverages, fabric, textiles, paper, and construction materials.<ref name=GSO09/>

Industrial production is not only in and around Nha Trang. The province has also benefited significantly from investment related to the former Russian naval base at [[Cam Ranh]], to which around 30 factories were attached.<ref>{{Cite news| title = Nga xây lại quân cảng Cam Ranh?| newspaper = BBC Vietnamese| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/vietnamese/vietnam/2010/10/101007_russia_camranh.shtml| date= 2010-10-07| access-date = 2011-07-08}}</ref> A major new industrial center is being developed in the north of the province around [[Vân Phong Port]] ([[Vân Phong Economic Zone]]).

==Infrastructure==
Khánh Hòa is located along Vietnam's main north–south transport corridors. [[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|National Road 1]] and the [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|North–South Railway]] run through the province.<ref name="Road Atlas 2004">Vietnam Road Atlas (Tập Bản đồ Giao thông Đường bộ Việt Nam). Cartographic Publishing House (Vietnam), 2004</ref> All [[Reunification Express]] trains as well as some local trains stop at [[Nha Trang Railway Station]].

As a coastal province featuring several natural deep water bays, Khánh Hòa has what is needed to develop its deep-water seaports. Nha Trang Port (a tourist and cargo port) and Dốc Lết Port (a shipbuilding and logistics port) are now in use. [[Vân Phong Port]], a [[megaproject]] intended to be developed in [[Vân Phong Bay]] by a consortium of Japanese corporations (with [[Sumitomo]] as the leading investor) with an estimated investment of US$15 billion, is in progress. On completion, this deep sea port will be capable of handling ships up to 100,000 tonnes and 100 million tonnes of loaded/unloaded cargo per annum.

[[Cam Ranh International Airport]] is located in the south of the province.

==Education==
Khánh Hòa is one of the most important educational centers in Vietnam. It is home to [[Nha Trang University]] (formerly Nha Trang Fishery University), a [[multidisciplinary]] university; the Naval Academy; the Air Force Officer Academy; a Normal College; a Kindergarten Teacher's Training College; and an Arts and Tourism College.
