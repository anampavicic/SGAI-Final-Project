In South Tyrol, [[South Tyrol#Languages|German remains the sizeable majority language]].

From the 9th century until 1801, the region was part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. After being part of the short-lived [[Italian Republic (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Republic of Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]], the region was part of the [[Austrian Empire]] and its successor [[Austria-Hungary]] from 1815 until its 1919 transfer to Italy in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] at the end of [[World War I]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Trentino|History of South Tyrol}}
[[File:Castello Buonconsiglio.jpg|thumb|left|The Prince-Bishops of Trent ruled from [[Buonconsiglio Castle]] from the 13th until the 19th century]]

The Romans conquered the region in 15&nbsp;BC. After the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]], it was divided between the [[Migration Period|invading Germanic tribes]] in the [[Lombards|Lombard]] [[Duchy of Tridentum]] (today's [[Trentino]]), the [[Alamanni]]c [[Vinschgau]], and the [[Bavarians]] (who took the remaining part). After the creation of the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] under [[Charlemagne]], the [[Marquisate of Verona]] included the areas south of [[Bolzano]], while the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] received the remaining part.<ref>''Allgemeiner historischer Handatlas'', Gustav Droysen.</ref>

From the 11th century onwards, part of the region was governed by the [[List of Prince-Bishops of Trent|prince-bishop]]s of [[Prince-Bishopric of Trent|Trent]] and [[Bishopric of Brixen|Brixen]], to whom the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperors]] had given extensive temporal powers over their bishoprics. Soon, they were overruled by the [[County of Tyrol|Counts of Tyrol]] and [[County of Gorizia|Counts of Görz]], who also controlled the [[Puster Valley]]: in 1363 its last titular, [[Margarete, Countess of Tyrol]] ceded the region to the [[House of Habsburg]]. The regions north of [[Salorno]] were largely [[Germanisation|Germanized]] in the early [[Middle Ages]], and important [[Germans|German]] poets like [[Arbeo of Freising]] and <!-- [[Walther von der Vogelweide]] and -->[[Oswald von Wolkenstein]] were born and lived in the southern part of [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]].<ref>''Ich Wolkenstein'', Dieter Kühn. {{ISBN|3-458-32197-7}}, p. 21</ref>

The two bishoprics were secularized by the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] of 1803 and given to the Habsburgs. Two years later, following the Austrian defeat at [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], the region was given to Napoleon's ally [[kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] ([[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]], 1805). The new rulers provoked a popular rebellion in 1809, led by [[Andreas Hofer]], a landlord from [[St. Leonhard in Passeier]]; this rebellion was crushed the same year. At the resulting Treaty of Paris (28 February 1810), Bavaria ceded the southern part of Tyrol (Trentino and the city of Bolzano) to the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.zobodat.at/pdf/VeroeffFerd_78_0209-0228.pdf|author=Eberhard Weis|title=Montgelas und Tirol (1806–1814)|journal=Veröffentlichungen des Tiroler Landesmuseums Ferdinandeum|year=1998|page=225|volume=78|language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hdbg.eu/koenigreich/index.php/objekte/index/herrscher_id/1/id/341|title=Karte: Bayern 1810|publisher=[[Haus der Bayerischen Geschichte]]|language=de|access-date=3 March 2020}}</ref> During French control of the region, it was called officially ''Haut Adige'' (literally "High [[Adige]]", Italian: "Alto Adige"; German: "Hochetsch") in order to avoid any reference to the historical County of Tyrol.<ref name="contemporary1">{{cite web |url=http://www.uibk.ac.at/zeitgeschichte/zis/stirol.html |title=Die Südtirolfrage |author=Prof. Dr. Rolf Steininger |year=2011 |work=ZIS Zeitgeschichte Informationssystem |publisher=Institute of Contemporary History, University of Innsbruck |access-date=15 April 2011}}</ref> After Napoleon's defeat, in 1815, the region returned to Austria.

Under Austrian rule the territory of today's province of South Tyrol was called ''südliches Tirol'' or ''Deutschsüdtirol'',<ref>Karl Höffinger (1887). ''Gries-Bozen in Deutsch-Südtirol, als klimatischer, Terrain-Kurort und Touristenstation – Vademecum für Einheimische, Reisende und Touristen in Gries-Bozen und im Etsch- und Eisack-Gebiete''. Innsbruck, Wagner.</ref> but was occasionally also referred to as ''Mitteltirol'', i.e. Middle Tyrol, due to its geographic position,<ref>e.g. Theodor Trautwein (1868). ''Wegweiser durch Süd-Baiern, Nord- und Mittel-Tirol und die angrenzenden Theile von Salzburg. Mit den Städten München, Augsburg, Salzburg, Innsbruck, Bozen und Meran''. Munich, Lindauer.</ref> while ''Südtirol'' ({{langx|it|Tirolo meridionale}}), i.e. South Tyrol, indicated mostly today's province of Trentino.<ref>Karl Müller (1916). ''An der Kampffront in Südtirol: Kriegsbriefe eines neutralen Offiziers''. Velhagen & Klasing.</ref> Trentino was also called ''{{lang|de|Welschtirol}}'' ("[[Romance languages|Romance]] Tyrol", {{langx|it|Tirolo italiano|links=no}}) or ''{{lang|de|Welschsüdtirol}}'' ("Romance South Tyrol", {{langx|it|Tirolo meridionale italiano|links=no}}). Sometimes ''Südtirol'' also indicated the whole of the Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol region.

During the First World War, major battles were fought high in the Alps and Dolomites between Austro-Hungarian [[Kaiserjäger]] and Italian [[Alpini]], for whom control of the region was a key strategic objective. The collapse of the Austro-Hungarian war effort enabled Italian troops to occupy the region in 1918 and its annexation was confirmed in the post-war treaties, which awarded the region to Italy under the terms of the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]].

Under the dictatorship of [[Benito Mussolini]], the Fascist dictator of Italy (ruled 1922–1943), the German population was subjected to an increased forced programme of [[Italianization]]: all references to old Tyrol were banned and the region was referred to as ''Venezia Tridentina'' between 1919 and 1947, in an attempt to justify the Italian claims to the area by historically linking the region to one of the [[Italia (Roman Empire)|Roman Regions of Italy]] (Regio X ''[[Venetia et Histria]]'').<ref>On Bolzano's fascist policies cf. Andrea Bonoldi, Hannes Obermair (2006). ''Tra Roma e Bolzano. Nazione e provincia nel ventennio fascista—Zwischen Rom und Bozen: Staat und Provinz im italienischen Faschismus''. Bozen-Bolzano: Città di Bolzano. {{ISBN|88-901870-9-3}}</ref> [[Hitler]] and Mussolini agreed in 1938 that the German-speaking population would be transferred to German-ruled territory or dispersed around Italy, but the outbreak of the Second World War prevented them from fully carrying out the relocation. Nevertheless, thousands of people were relocated to [[Nazi Germany]] and only with great difficulties managed to return to their ancestral land after the end of the war.<ref>Helmut Alexander, Adolf Leidlmair, Stefan Lechner (1993). ''Heimatlos: die Umsiedlung der Südtiroler''. Vienna: Deuticke. {{ISBN|3-216-07832-9}}</ref>

In 1943, when the Italian government signed an armistice with the Allies, the region was occupied by Germany, which reorganised it as the [[Operation Zone of the Alpine Foothills]] and put it under the administration of [[Gauleiter]] [[Franz Hofer]]. The region was ''de facto'' annexed to the [[Nazi Germany|German Reich]] (with the addition of the [[province of Belluno]]) until the end of the war. This status ended along with the [[Nazi]] regime and Italian rule was restored in 1945.

Italy and Austria negotiated the [[Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement]] in 1946, put into effect in 1947 when the new republican [[Constitution of Italy|Italian constitution]] was promulgated, that the region would be granted considerable autonomy. German and Italian were both made official languages, and German-language education was permitted once more. The region was called ''Trentino-Alto Adige/Tiroler Etschland'' between 1947 and 1972.

However, the implementation of the agreement was not seen as satisfactory by neither the German-speaking population nor the Austrian government. The issue became the cause of significant friction between the two countries and was taken up by the United Nations in 1960. A fresh round of negotiations took place in 1961 but proved unsuccessful, partly because of popular discontent and a campaign of terrorism and bombings by German-speaking autonomists and separatists led by the [[South Tyrolean Liberation Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dna.trentino.it/movimento-terroristico-negli-anni-60/ |title=Il movimento terroristico negli anni '60 - DNA Trentino |publisher=Dna.trentino.it |date=1967-06-22 |accessdate=2022-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=fab |url=http://www.piantiamolamemoria.org/terrorismo-in-alto-adige/ |title=Vittime del terrorismo in Alto Adige 1965-1967 – Piantiamolamemoria |publisher=Piantiamolamemoria.org |date=2017-08-27 |accessdate=2022-03-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ladige.it/blog/2021/06/10/sessant-anni-fa-la-notte-dei-fuochi-1.2932480 |title=Sessant'anni fa la "Notte dei fuochi": l'analisi e il racconto nel blog di Luigi Sardi - Blog &#124; l'Adige.it |publisher=Ladige.it |date=2021-03-15 |accessdate=2022-03-16}}</ref>

The issue was resolved in 1971, when a new Austro-Italian treaty was signed and ratified. It stipulated that disputes in South Tyrol would be submitted for settlement to the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]], that the province would receive greater autonomy within Italy, and that Austria would not interfere in South Tyrol's internal affairs. The new agreement proved broadly satisfactory to the parties involved and the separatist tensions soon eased. Matters were helped further by Austria's accession to the [[European Union]] in 1995, which has helped to improve cross-border cooperation.<ref name="contemporary1"/>

In May 2006, senator-for-life [[Francesco Cossiga]] introduced a bill that would allow the region to hold a referendum, in which the local electorate could decide whether to stay within the Italian Republic, become fully independent or return to Austria. All parties, including the separatists, rejected this measure as potentially causing a revival of ethnic tensions.

== Geography ==
[[File:Trafoi 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alps|Alpine]] landscape near the village of [[Stilfs]], South Tyrol]]
[[File:Riva del Garda.jpg|thumb|Lakeside promenade in [[Riva del Garda]], Trentino]]
The region is bordered by East and North [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] (Austria) to the north-east and north respectively, by [[Graubünden]] (Switzerland) to the north-west, and by the Italian regions of [[Lombardy]] to the west and [[Veneto]] to the south and southeast. It covers {{convert|13607|km2|abbr=on}}. It is extremely mountainous, covering a large part of the [[Dolomites]] and the southern [[Alps]].

The region is composed of two provinces, Trentino in the south and South Tyrol in the north.

[[Trentino]] has an area of {{cvt|6,207|km2}}, most of it mountainous land (20% is over {{convert|2000|m|-2|abbr=on}} and 70% over 1,000 m) and covered by vast forests (50% of the territory). The climate is various through the province, from an alpine climate to subcontinental one, with warm and variable summers and cold and quite snowy winters. The region has always been a favourite destination for tourists, both in winter for skiing in the high mountains and in summer to visit the wide valleys and many lakes (the largest being [[Lake Garda]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd2_geo.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805181615/http://www.circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd2_geo.htm |archive-date=5 August 2007 }}</ref>

[[South Tyrol]] has an area of {{convert|7398|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}, all of it mountainous land and covered by vast forests. The climate is of the continental type, owing to the influence of the many mountain ranges which stand at well over {{convert|3000|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]] and the wide valleys through which flow the main river, the [[Adige]], from north to south and its numerous tributaries. In the city of [[Bolzano]], capital of the province, the average air temperature stands at {{convert|12.2|°C|1|abbr=on}} and the average rainfall at {{convert|717.7|mm|1|abbr=on}}. The lowest pass across the Alps, the [[Brenner Pass]], is located at the far north of the region on the [[Austria–Italy border|border with Austria]].<ref name="regportraits1">{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd1_geo.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805181959/http://www.circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itd1_geo.htm |archive-date=5 August 2007 }}</ref>

== Politics ==
{{Main|Politics of Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol}}
[[File:Trentino-South Tyrol Provinces.png|thumb|300px|Map of the two autonomous provinces of the region]]
The region is divided into two autonomous [[Provinces of Italy|provinces]]: Trentino (Autonomous Province of Trento) and South Tyrol (Autonomous Province of Bolzano). The Italian Republic recognised a certain degree of autonomy for the region and its two constituent provinces, which was the result of the [[Gruber–De Gasperi Agreement]] of 1946, as well as of the special status of autonomy approved by constitutional law in 1948. This statute gave the region the right to initiate its own laws on a wide range of subjects and to carry out respective administrative functions.

In 1972, the introduction of the second Statute of Autonomy, which was in the centre of the discussions between the Italian and Austrian governments, meant the transfer of the main competencies from the region to the two provinces. The autonomy recognized by the special statute covers the political, legislative, administrative, and fiscal institutions. The second statute turned the region ''de facto'' into a loose [[commonwealth]] with [[devolution|devolved]] powers to the two autonomous provinces, with very limited legislative or executive competencies left.

The capital city is Trento, although the two provincial capitals alternate biennially (the other being [[Bolzano]]) as the site of the regional assembly.<ref name="regportraits1"/>

== Economy ==
[[File:Hang DorfTirol.jpg|thumb|Vineyards at the municipality of [[Dorf Tirol|Tirol]]]]
{{see also|Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol wine}}
The region's fertile valleys produce [[List of Italian DOC wines|wine]], fruit, dairy products, and timber, while its industries include paper, chemical and metal production. The region is a major exporter of [[hydroelectric]] power. The most important features of the region's economic structure are the strength of tourism and the special system of co-operation between agriculture and industry. In the last decade, tourism became a very important component of the province's economy. The region, which is a staging-post between the countries of northern Europe and central and southern Italy, has found its true vocation in this leading branch of the services sector with all its spin-offs. The region has a higher concentration of hotels than any other region (6,178 establishments in 2001 with 236,864 hotel beds). The total accommodation capacity of the region counts for 651,426 beds available in hotels and other establishments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/index.htm |title=Eurostat |publisher=Circa.europa.eu |access-date=6 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201175658/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/index.htm |archive-date=1 February 2009 }}</ref>

The main language groups are Italian and German, with small minorities speaking [[Ladin language|Ladin]], [[Lombard language|Lombard]], [[Mòcheno language|Mòcheno]] and [[Cimbrian language|Cimbrian]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/lmo|title=Lombard}}</ref> The latter two of which are varieties of the [[Upper German]] [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] dialect.<ref>Anthony R.

In Trentino the majority language is Italian, although there are Cimbrian minorities in the municipality of [[Luserna]] and four Mòcheno municipalities in the [[Valle dei Mòcheni|Mòcheni Valley]]. There are also Ladin-speaking minorities living in the [[Fassa Valley]] and in [[Non Valley]] (3.5% of the population). While in Fassa Valley Ladin already enjoys official status, in Non Valley it still does not, despite there being more Ladin speakers in the latter than in the former. [[Sole Valley]] also historically belongs to the Ladin area.

In South Tyrol the majority language is German (62% of the population), although in the capital city [[Bolzano]] 73% of the population speaks Italian as its maternal language due to internal immigration from other regions of Italy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.provincia.bz.it/astat/downloads/mit17_02.pdf|title=Landesinstitut für Statistik – Autonome Provinz Bozen – Südtirol|first=Südtiroler Informatik AG &#124; Informatica Alto Adige|last=SPA|access-date=8 April 2017}}</ref> Italian speakers are also a significant component in other major urban centres of the province, such as in [[Merano]] (49% Italian as the mother language) and [[Brixen]] (26% mother language).<ref>Statistisches Jahrbuch für Südtirol 2014 / Annuario statistico della Provincia di Bolzano 2014 | work = Table 3.18, page 118</ref> More than 90% of the 120,000 Italian speakers live in Bozen/Bolzano, Merano, Leifers and Brixen, and the greater part of the rest in the small towns south of the capital just north of the border with Trentino or scattered about in very small numbers throughout the rest of the province. The Italian language is a majority in 5 of 116 municipalities. Italian is the first language of 26% of the population (down from 35% in 1960) of the population of 453,000 recorded in the 2011 census, not counting the 51,000 who listed Language as 'Other' who are immigrants. Ladin is the additional official language in some municipalities and a majority in 8. According to the census of 2001, 103 out of 116 communes have a majority of German native speakers, eight of Ladin speakers and five of Italian. Today both German and Italian have the status of co-[[official languages]] in South Tyrol.
