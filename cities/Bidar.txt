Bidar city is known for its [[Bidri ware|Bidri]] [[handicraft]] products, and its rich history. Bidar is also considered one of the holiest place for Sikh pilgrimage. Unlike other places in the region, Bidar is the coldest and wettest place in north Karnataka. For the year 2009–10, Bidar was ranked 22nd among the cleanest cities in India, and 5th cleanest in Karnataka.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.rediff.com/slide-show/2010/may/11/slide-show-1-chandigarh-cleanest-of-all.htm |title=India's cleanest: Where does your city stand? |publisher=News.rediff.com |date=2010-05-13 |access-date=2013-12-19}}</ref> [[State Highway 4 (Karnataka)|SH4]] passes through Bidar and the whole city is integrated with 4 lane road.

== Etymology ==
The name Bidar appears to be derived from ‘bidiru’, which means bamboo.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Bidar District {{!}} Bidar District, Government of Karnataka {{!}} India |url=https://bidar.nic.in/en/about-district/ |access-date=20 April 2022 |language=en-US}}</ref> It was also referred as ''Bhadrakot''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iRJuAAAAMAAJ|title=A Comprehensive History of India: The Delhi Sultanate, A.D. 1206-1526|year=1970|publisher=People's Publishing House|author=Mohammad Habib and Khaliq Ahmad Nizami|page=465}}</ref>

Legend has associated Bidar with the ancient kingdom of [[Vidarbha]], to which references are found in early Hindu literature like ''[[Malavikagnimitra]], [[Mahabharata]], the [[Harivamsa]], [[Bhagavata Purana|Bhagavata]]'', and a few other ''[[Puranas]]''.{{sfn|Yazdani, 1947|pp=3}}{{rp|3}}  Its association can be seen apparently on account of the similarity in names ''Bidar'' and ''Vidarbha''. This has been mentioned in [[Firishta|Firishta's]] writings.

The traditional tales reveal that [[Vidura]] lived here; hence the place was earlier called '''Viduranagara''' and also as the place where [[Nala]] and [[Damayanti]] (Daughter of ''Raja Bhima'', the King of Vidharba) were meeting.<ref name="gaz">{{cite book|title=Karnataka Gazetteer|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Govt. of Karnataka|edition=Second}}</ref>

Bidar under the rule of the [[Bahmani Sultanate]] was known as Muhammadabad.

== History ==
{{main|History of Bidar}}
The recorded History of the city goes back to the third century B.C. when it was a part of the [[Mauryan Empire]]. After the Mauryas, [[Satavahana]]s, [[Kadamba dynasty|Kadamba]] and [[Chalukya]]s of Badami and later the [[Rashtrakuta]]s reigned over Bidar territory. The Chalukyas of Kalyana and [[Kalachuris of Kalyani]]s also regained the area. For a short period after Kalyani Chalukyas the area of Bidar was under the rule of [[Seuna (Yadava) dynasty|Seuna]]s of [[Daulatabad Fort|Devagiri]] and [[Kakatiya dynasty|Kakatiya]]s of [[Warangal]].

=== Bahmani Sultanate ===
{{Hatnote|Main article: [[Bahamani Sultanate]]}}
The [[Delhi Sultanate]] invaded the area first by [[Allauddin Khilji]], and later, [[Muhammad Tughlaq|Muhammed-bin-Tughluq]] took control of entire [[Deccan sultanates|Deccan]] including Bidar. In the middle of the 14th century, the Sultan of Delhi's officers that were stationed in Deccan rebelled and this resulted in the establishment of [[Bahamani|Bahmanid Dynasty]] in 1347 A.D. at Gulbarga/Hasanabad (present [[Kalaburagi]]). There was frequent warfare between the Bahmanids and the [[Vijaynagar Empire|Vijaynagar Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bidartourism.com/history.html |title=History of Bidar |access-date=27 August 2014 |archive-date=3 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903204128/http://www.bidartourism.com/history.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The history of the present fort at Bidar is attributed to the sultan [[Ahmad Shah I Wali|Ahmed Shah Wali Bahmani]], the  sultan of the Bahmani dynasty till 1427, when he shifted his capital from Gulbarga to Bidar since it had better climatic conditions and was also a fertile and fruit-bearing land.  The earliest recorded history of its existence as a small and strong fort is also traced to prince Ulugh Khan in 1322, whereafter it came under the reign of the [[Tughlaq dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://kannadasiri.kar.nic.in/heritage/heritage_areas.htm | title=Heritage Areas}}</ref>

With the establishment of the Bahmanid dynasty (1347), Bidar was occupied by Sultan Ala-ud-Din Bahman Shah Bahmani. During the rule of Ahmad Shah I (1422–1486), Bidar was made the capital city of [[Bahmani Kingdom]].{{sfn|Yazdani, 1947|pp=5}}<ref name="sen2">{{Cite book |last=Sen |first=Sailendra |title=A Textbook of Medieval Indian History |publisher=Primus Books |year=2013 |isbn=978-9-38060-734-4 |pages=106–108}}</ref> The old fort was rebuilt and [[madrasa]]s, [[mosques]], palaces, and gardens were raised. [[Mahmud Gawan]], who became the [[prime minister]] in 1466, was a notable figure in the history of Bidar. Bidar remained under the [[Barid Shahi Dynasty|Barid Shahi dynasty]] until conquest by the [[Bijapur Sultanate]] in 1619.
[[Aurangazeb|Aurangzeb]] came to Bidar after his father, [[Padshah]] (emperor) [[Shah Jahan]], appointed him the Prince of Deccan. He wrested the Bidar Fort from the Adil Shahis after a 21-day war in 1656. With this, Bidar became a part of the [[Mughal dynasty]] for the second time.<ref>{{cite news|title=An occasion to recall Aurangazeb's association with this historic city|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/an-occasion-to-recall-aurangazebs-association-with-this-historic-city/article1505356.ece|newspaper=The Hindu|access-date=5 March 2015|date=3 March 2011|last1=Desai|first1=Rishikesh Bahadur}}</ref><ref name="Britanica">{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64749/Bidar|title=Geography and travel|access-date=2009-11-08|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091204074805/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/64749/Bidar| archive-date= 4 December 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> Bidar was made a [[subah]] (imperial top-level province) in 1656, which [[Telangana Subah]] was merged into the next year.{{sfn|Haig, 1907|pp=102}}

In 1724, Bidar became a part of the Asaf Jahi Kingdom of the [[Nizams]]. Third son of Asaf jah l ( Nizam l ) [[Mir Sa'id Muhammad Khan, Salabat Jang]] ruled from [[Bidar fort]] from 1751 to 1762, till his brother Mir Nizam Ali Khan Asaf Jah III imprisoned him in this fort, and was killed in Bidar fort on 16 September 1763. ''Mohammedabad'' old name of Bidar is also on his name. It was connected to Hyderabad by rail in the early 20th century.{{sfn|Yazdani, 1947|pp=20}} After India's independence, in 1956 all Kannada speaking areas were merged to form the Mysore State and Bidar became part of the new Mysore (now Karnataka) state.<ref name="Britanica" /><ref name="Sherwani">{{Cite book

==== Karez System ====
{{Hatnote|Main article: [[Qanat]]}}
Ancient [[Bidar Fort#Karez.28Ancient water supply system.29|Karez System]] in the city have been recently discovered. The Karez ([[Qanat]]) is an underground network of aqueducts for water supply. The Bidar Karez, built in the 15th century, is more than {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} long with 21 air vents.<ref>{{cite news |date=17 December 2012 |title=Picnic spot of Barid Shahi kings discovered in Bidar |work=The Hindu |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-karnataka/picnic-spot-of-barid-shahi-kings-discovered-in-bidar/article4208180.ece |access-date=5 March 2015}}</ref> Underground canals, built to connect underground water streams, were meant to provide drinking water to civilian settlements and the garrison inside the Bidar fort. This was necessary in a city where the soil was rocky and drilling wells was difficult.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Bidar District {{!}} Bidar District, Government of Karnataka {{!}} India |url=https://bidar.nic.in/en/about-district/ |access-date=12 March 2022 |language=en-US}}</ref> The Bidar karez systems, believed to be the earliest ones in India, were constructed during the Bahmani period. According to [[Ghulam Yazdani|Gulam Yazdani]]'s documentation, Bidar has three karez systems: Naubad, Shukla Theerth, and Jamna Mori. Among these, Shukla Theerth stands out as the longest karez system in Bidar. The origin well of this karez was found near Gornalli Kere, a historic embankment. Jamna Mori, on the other hand, primarily served as a distribution system within the old city, with numerous channels intersecting the city streets.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Yazdani |first=G. |title=Bidar: Its History and Monuments |date=1995-10-01 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-1071-6 |edition=1st Indian |location=Delhi |language=English}}</ref>

Restoration efforts began in 2014, focusing on the desilting and excavation of the Naubad Karez.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2015-12-14 |title=Resurrecting the Karez |url=https://www.deccanherald.com/content/517462/resurrecting-karez.html |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=Deccan Herald |language=en}}</ref>  In 2015, this initiative led to the discovery of 27 vertical shafts connected to the Karez. The rejuvenation of these systems has had a significant positive impact on Bidar, a city facing [[water scarcity]]. Additionally, in 2016, during a sewage line excavation, a seventh line of the system was uncovered.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2016-06-29 |title=New 'surang bavi' line found in Bidar |language=en-IN |work=The Hindu |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/karnataka/New-%E2%80%98surang-bavi%E2%80%99-line-found-in-Bidar/article14409242.ece |access-date=2023-05-22 |issn=0971-751X}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Bidar is located at {{Coord|17.9|N|77.5|E}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/19/Bidar.html |title=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc – Bidar |publisher=Fallingrain.com |access-date=2013-12-19}}</ref> lies at a central position in Deccan, a plateau at an elevation of 2300&nbsp;ft from the sea level.  It has common boundaries with [[Maharashtra]] and [[Telangana]] which is, with the districts of [[Nizamabad district|Nizamabad]] and [[Medak District|Medak]] in [[Telangana]] on the East and the districts of [[Latur]], [[Nanded]] and [[Osmanabad]] in [[Maharashtra]] on the west. On the south lies the district [[Gulbarga]] of [[Karnataka]].<ref>{{Cite web |date= |title=Map of District |url=https://cdn.s3waas.gov.in/s32ca65f58e35d9ad45bf7f3ae5cfd08f1/uploads/2020/08/2020082741-723x1024.jpg |website=Bidar District Website - Government of Karnataka}}</ref>

=== Geology ===
[[File:Laterite - Bidar.JPG|thumb|[[Laterite]] under the [[Top soil]] Layer]]
The upper [[Crust (geology)|crust]] of the [[plateau]] is of [[laterite]], a soft porous rock with limonitic surface. This crust varies in depth from {{convert|100|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|500|ft|m|abbr=on}} and rests on a bed of trap, which is of much harder texture and less pervious to water. The volume of water filtered during the [[monsoons]] through the laterite stratum is arrested by the trappean bed, and a nursery of [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] is formed whose natural level of effluence is the line of contact of the two strata along the base of the [[cliffs]] of the plateau. The water in course of time frets out for itself an orifice and macerates and loosens portions of its rocky channel till a [[rift]] is produced. The rift gradually dilates into a [[ravine]], and the ravine expands into a [[Valley|vale]].

The [[Karez System]] is built along a [[geological fracture]]. Such fractures are formed at the intersection of [[laterite]] and [[Basalt|basalt rocks]] and form lineaments or [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] that yield water.<ref>{{cite news|title=A thrilling walk through medieval waterways|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-andhrapradesh/a-thrilling-walk-through-medieval-waterways/article6556625.ece|access-date=6 March 2015|work=The Hindu|date=2 November 2014}}</ref>

=== Soil ===
Bidar soils are deep (&gt;100&nbsp;cm), well-drained gravelly red clayey soils developed on plateaus of laterites. They are ''slightly'' acid to neutral ([[pH]] 6.6) in reaction with low [[cation exchange capacity]]. They are highly gravelly soils with gravel content (60 to 10%) that decrease with depth.<ref>''Characterisation of sugarcane soils of Karnataka'' L.C.K.

Once a home to many cottage industries, such as cotton and oil-ginning mills,<ref>Bidar District Gazetteer, Govt.
