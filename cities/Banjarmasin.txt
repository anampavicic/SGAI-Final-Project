The city is located on a [[river delta|delta]] island near the junction of the [[Barito River|Barito]] and [[Martapura River|Martapura]] rivers. Historically the centre of the [[Banjar people|Banjarese culture]], and the capital of the [[Sultanate of Banjar]], it is the biggest city in [[South Kalimantan]] and one of the main cities of [[Kalimantan]]. The city covers an area of {{cvt|98.46|km2}} and had a population of 625,481 as of the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 657,663 as of the 2020 Census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as of mid 2023 was 675,915 (comprising 337,819 males and 338,096 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Banjarmasin Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.6371)</ref> It is the third most populous city on the island of [[Borneo]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |title=Profil Kota Banjarmasin {{!}} BPK RI Perwakilan Provinsi Kalimantan Selatan |url=https://kalsel.bpk.go.id/kota-banjarmasin |access-date=2021-05-08 |language=en-US |archive-date=8 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508175840/https://kalsel.bpk.go.id/kota-banjarmasin |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Omed |first=Kata |date=2020-05-25 |title=Daftar 10 Kota Besar di Kalimantan |url=https://kataomed.com/kota/daftar-10-kota-besar-di-kalimantan |access-date=2021-05-21 |website=KATA OMED |language=en-GB |archive-date=1 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201101101948/https://kataomed.com/kota/daftar-10-kota-besar-di-kalimantan |url-status=live}}</ref> 

Greater Banjarmasin, also known as Banjarbakula (an acronym for '''Banjar'''masin-'''Ba'''rito '''Ku'''ala-Tanah '''La'''ut) or Banjar Raya, is an urban agglomeration of over two million people covering an area of {{cvt|6945.67|km2}}, which includes [[Banjarbaru]] city and parts of [[Banjar Regency]] (including Martapura town), [[Barito Kuala Regency]], and [[Tanah Laut Regency]], and accounts for almost half of the province's population.

Banjarmasin was the ''[[de jure]]'' seat of the South Kalimantan governor and the location of the provincial parliament, although some provincial buildings have been relocated to Banjarbaru.<ref>{{Cite web |title=PU-net |url=http://perkotaan.bpiw.pu.go.id/n/metropolitan/9 |access-date=2021-05-08 |website=perkotaan.bpiw.pu.go.id |archive-date=10 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210510142514/http://perkotaan.bpiw.pu.go.id/n/metropolitan/9 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Banjarmasin Dalam Angka 2021 |url=https://banjarmasinkota.bps.go.id/publication/2021/02/26/048ab356826a4dc4ce1e159b/kota-banjarmasin-dalam-angka-2021.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210510142839/https://banjarmasinkota.bps.go.id/publication/2021/02/26/048ab356826a4dc4ce1e159b/kota-banjarmasin-dalam-angka-2021.html |archive-date=10 May 2021 |access-date=2021-05-08 |website=banjarmasinkota.bps.go.id}}</ref> On 15 February 2022, the capital of South Kalimantan province was [[Law on South Kalimantan province|legally moved]] to Banjarbaru.

===Etymology===
"Banjarmasin" is thought to be a corrupted version of "Bandar Masih" (Port Masih), which was named for Patih Masih, who ruled the port and the surrounding villages. Patih Masih's name may have been a nickname. ''Masih'' originates from the [[Ngaju language]]. ''Oloh Masi'' refers to the coastal-dwelling Malay population in the language of the [[Dayaks]], who lived in the interior and visited the port regularly to trade. Some of the Dayaks eventually settled in the port. They eventually contributed to the culture of the [[Banjar people]], along with the [[Javanese people|Javanese]] and [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]].<ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite web |title=Asal Usul Nama Kota Banjarmasin dari Sosok Ini |url=https://banjarmasin.tribunnews.com/2020/06/22/asal-usul-nama-kota-banjarmasin-dari-sosok-ini |access-date=2021-05-08 |website=Banjarmasin Post |language=id-ID |archive-date=8 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508215055/https://banjarmasin.tribunnews.com/2020/06/22/asal-usul-nama-kota-banjarmasin-dari-sosok-ini |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Early history===
[[File:Komplek Makam Sultan Suriansyah.jpg|thumb|Burial complex of Sultan Suriansyah, first sultan of Banjar]]
European archeologist H. Kupper discovered several prehistoric sites around the region in 1939 and found implements such as [[Chopper (archaeology)|choppers]] and other stone tools. Most of the artifacts found around the region and the province show signs of [[Neolithic]] culture. Migration from mainland Asia to Borneo may have been common while they were connected by the [[Sunda Shelf]]. Many stone tools have been found in Awang Bangkal, {{cvt|50|km}} from the city.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |title=Sejarah Daerah Kalimantan Selatan (History of South Kalimantan Region) |publisher=Department of Education and Cultural Affairs (Indonesia) |year=1978 |isbn= |pages= }}</ref>

Until the early 15th century, there were few written records found from the region. Outside records indicate it was home to several kingdoms such as [[Tanjungpuri]]—theorized to have been founded by Malay people from [[Srivijaya]]—and [[Negara Daha]] and [[Negara Dipa|Dipa]], which were founded by Javanese people from [[Majapahit]]. [[Hinduism in Indonesia|Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism in Indonesia|Buddhism]] entered the region between the first and 15th centuries. There are two ''[[Candi of Indonesia|candis]]'' (temples) left in the region, Candi Laras and Candi Agung.<ref>{{Cite web |last=bpcbkaltim |date=19 February 2020 |title=Usia Candi Laras |url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpcbkaltim/usia-candi-laras/ |access-date=8 May 2021 |website=Balai Pelestarian Cagar Budaya Kalimantan Timur |language=en-US |archive-date=8 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210508212001/https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpcbkaltim/usia-candi-laras/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Ma'anyan people]] may have ruled the oldest kingdom in the archipelago, [[Nan Sarunai]].

The history of Banjarmasin itself began during the founding of the [[Sultanate of Banjar]]. According to folk stories and the ''[[Hikayat Banjar]]'', Sukarama, the fourth king of Negara Daha, wanted his grandson, Raden Samudra, to be his successor in the kingdom instead of his direct son Prince Tumenggung. Prince Tumenggung later banished Raden Samudra and tried to reclaim the throne for himself. Raden Samudra fled to the region that would later be known as Banjarmasin. There, he met Patih Masih. Under Samudra's leadership, the port grew into the town of Bandar Masih.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kerajaan Banjar: Sejarah, Pendiri, Masa Jaya dan Raja |url=https://voi.id/memori/40993/kerajaan-banjar-sejarah-pendiri-masa-jaya-dan-raja |access-date=8 May 2021 |website=VOI – Waktunya Merevolusi Pemberitaan |language=id |archive-date=10 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210510143338/https://voi.id/memori/40993/kerajaan-banjar-sejarah-pendiri-masa-jaya-dan-raja |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":3" /> Tumenggung, who disliked Samudra's growing power, wanted to invade the town. Samudra allied with the [[Demak Sultanate]], which agreed to help him. In return he would have to convert to Islam if he won. With the help of expeditionary forces from Demak, Samudra defeated the Tumenggung forces and proclaimed the Banjar Sultanate. He changed his name to Sultan Suriansyah&nbsp;I. The sultanate became more reliant on the Demak to the point that it was considered their protectorate. However, between 1546 and 1550, as conquests and the [[spice trade]] enriched the sultanate, it became independent and stopped sending tributes to Java.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">{{cite book |last=Barjie B |first=Ahmad |title=Perang Banjar Barito |date=2015 |publisher=Penakita Publisher |isbn=9786021285558 |page=}}</ref>

===Colonial era===

The first contact between Europeans and the Banjar people in the region came through trade. Starting in 1596, this mostly took place in [[Banten]]. European traders, largely [[Netherlands|Dutch]], did not bother visiting the port until Banten's rulers banned them. The traders resorted to attacking ships from other countries, including ships under the Banjar Sultanate, to steal [[nutmeg]]. The Sultan took revenge against a Dutch ship visiting Banjarmasin on 17&nbsp;July 1607 by hijacking it and massacring the crew. Similar incidents occurred several times between 1603 and 1636, ending when the sultanate reached a trade agreement that put the [[Dutch East India Company]] in control of the nutmeg trade from the sultanate and gave it a monopoly over trade in Banjarmasin. The company was expelled in 1638, however, after the sultan waged a war against the Dutch and burned much of the company's possessions around the port.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Noorlander |first=J.C. |title=Banjarmasin en de Compagnie in de Tweede Helft der 18 de Eeuw |publisher=N.

Similarly, an English company agreed upon a treaty with the sultanate in 1698 but was expelled from the region in 1707. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Banjarmasin was subject to British control, a situation complicated by the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814]], which was seen to have mandated its transfer to Dutch authority.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" />This directive paradoxically conflicted with a prior 1812 treaty between the British East India Company and the sultanate, which prohibited the region’s transfer to any other European power.<ref name=":11">{{Cite journal |last=Graham |first=Irwin |date=1955 |title=The Restoration of Dutch Rule |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1163/j.ctvbnm4tq.8 |journal=Nineteenth-Century Borneo: A Study in Diplomatic Rivalry |volume=15 |pages=44 |jstor=10.1163/j.ctvbnm4tq.8 |via=JSTOR}}</ref> This issue was navigated by the then Governor of Java, [[John Fendall Jr.|John Fendall]], who argued that the 1812 treaty’s conditions were still valid. Sovereignty was therefore effectively transferred from the British East India Company to the Sultan in late 1816, and not directly to the Dutch.<ref name=":11" /> The dispute over sovereignty was finally settled when the Sultan of Banjarmasin settled an agreement with the Netherlands in January 1817, effectively confirming Dutch control over the region.<ref name=":11" /> A succession crisis between Sultan Adam and Tamjidillah&nbsp;II and a dispute over resource control of coal mines resulted in a war between the sultanate and the Dutch East Indies Company which led to the end of the sultanate in 1863. The war continued until 1905 under an emergency government set up by the sultanate called Pagustian. The last resistance was put down with the capture of Queen Zaleha in 1906.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Sejarah Kesultanan Dan Budaya Banjar |url=https://idr.uin-antasari.ac.id/5256/1/Sejarah%20Kesultanan%20dan%20Budaya%20Banjar.pdf |url-status=live |access-date=8 May 2021 |archive-date=10 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210510142757/https://idr.uin-antasari.ac.id/5256/1/Sejarah%20Kesultanan%20dan%20Budaya%20Banjar.pdf}}</ref> As a result of the war, many Banjar people from Borneo migrated to [[Sumatra]], [[Singapore]], and [[Malaysia]] and formed communities there.<ref name=":5" />

===20th century–present===
[[File:Japanese attack on Borneo, 1941-1942.jpg|thumb|Route of Japanese attack on Borneo, 1942]]When [[World War&nbsp;II]] broke out, the city was occupied by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. After the [[Battle of Banjarmasin]], control was transferred to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]]. Locals described Japanese rule under the navy as harsher compared to the army. This led many people to escape to [[Java]], which remained under army rule. The city was liberated by Australian forces in September 1945. The return of Dutch rule, however, was opposed by the people and resulted in the [[Kalimantan Physical Revolution]], four years of war between Indonesian nationalists and the [[Royal Netherlands East Indies Army]]. This ended with the [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference|Dutch recognition of Indonesia]] in 1949. The city was briefly assigned as the capital of [[Great Dayak]] federal state before being absorbed into a single Kalimantan province.
