[[File:Tobruk port 23.jpg|thumb|[[Port of Tobruk]]]]

Tobruk was the site of an [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] colony and, later, of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] fortress guarding the frontier of [[Cyrenaica]].<ref name=TobBC /> Over the centuries, Tobruk also served as a waystation along the coastal [[caravan (travellers)|caravan route]].<ref name=TobBC/> By 1911, Tobruk had become an [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] military post. 

During [[World War II]], Allied forces, mainly the Australian [[6th Division (Australia)|6th Division]], took Tobruk on 22 January 1941. The Australian 9th Division ("[[The Rats of Tobruk]]") pulled back to Tobruk to avoid encirclement after actions at [[Ar Rajma|Er Regima]] and [[Mechili]] and reached Tobruk on 9 April 1941. There [[Siege of Tobruk|prolonged fighting]] followed, against  a siege by German and Italian forces.

Although the siege was lifted by [[Operation Crusader]] in November 1941, a renewed offensive by [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces under [[Erwin Rommel]] the following year resulted in Tobruk being captured in June 1942. It was held by the Axis forces until November 1942, when it was recaptured by the Allies. 

Rebuilt after [[World War II]], Tobruk was later expanded during the 1960s to include a [[Port of Tobruk|port terminal]] linked by an [[oil pipeline]] to the [[Sarir oil field]].<ref name=TobBC/>

King [[Idris of Libya]] had his palace at Bab Zaytun. Tobruk was traditionally a stronghold of the Senussi royal dynasty and one of the first to rebel against [[Muammar Gaddafi]] in the [[Arab Spring]].

==Geography==
[[File:Tobruk air view03.jpg|thumb|left|An aerial image of Tobruk's harbour.]]
Tobruk has a [[Port of Tobruk|strong, naturally protected deep harbour]]. It is probably the best natural port in northern [[Africa]],{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} although due to the lack of important nearby land sites it is certainly not the most popular. The city is effectively surrounded by a desert lightly populated with [[nomad]]ic herdsmen who travel from [[oasis]] to oasis.

There are many [[escarpment]]s (cliffs) to the south of Tobruk, as is common across Cyrenaica, the eastern half of Libya. These escarpments generally have their high sides to the south and their low sides ([[dip slope]]s) to the north. This constitutes a substantial physical barrier between the north and south of Libya in the Tobruk area.

Previously, Tobruk was some {{convert|470|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Benghazi]] through the [[Libyan Coastal Highway]], but this distance was shortened to {{convert|450|km|mi|abbr=on}} after the construction of the [[Charruba–Timimi Road]] between the years 1975 and 1985. Construction of the [[Tobruk–Ajdabiya Road]] reduced the distance between those two cities from {{convert|620|km|mi|abbr=on}} to about {{convert|410|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Because it is approximately {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} away from [[Egypt]] by land, Tobruk is also an important hub for merchants from both [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]], and for travellers between the two countries as well as those from [[Bayda, Libya|Bayda]] and [[Derna, Libya|Derna]].

Tobruk suffers a serious [[saltwater intrusion]] problem. A factory for the [[desalination]] of sea water has been built there.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

===Climate===
Tobruk features a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh'' according to the [[Köppen climate classification]].) However, its maritime location allows it to receive significantly more precipitation than areas further inland in the Sahara desert.

==History==
===Ancient===
{{further|Marmarica|North Africa during Antiquity}}
An [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] agricultural colony, ''Antipyrgus'' ({{langx|grc|Ἀντίπυργος}}, ''Antipyrgos'') was once on the site of modern Tobruk,<ref name=TobBC/> and the ancient name is still occasionally in use. The name roughly meant "across from [[Tylissos|Pyrgos]]", referring to a location in [[Crete]] across the [[Mediterranean Sea]] from Antipyrgos. In the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] era, the town became a Roman [[fortress]] guarding the [[Cyrenaica]]n frontier. With the spread of Christianity, Antipyrgus became an [[episcopal see]]. Only one of its ancient bishops is known by name: Aemilianus, who took part in the [[Second Council of Constantinople]] in 553.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160103031022/https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C&printsec=frontcover |date=2016-01-03 }}, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 633-634</ref> No longer a residential bishopric, Antipyrgus is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 834</ref> Later the site became a way station on the [[Camel train|caravan]] route that ran along the coast.

===World War II===
{{undue weight|date=October 2020}}
{{main|Western Desert Campaign|Siege of Tobruk}}

At the beginning of [[World War II]], [[Italian Libya|Libya was an Italian colony]] and Tobruk became the site of important [[battle]]s between the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]].  Tobruk was strategically important to the conquest of Eastern Libya, then the province of Cyrenaica, for several reasons.

====Strategic importance====
[[File:Map of siege of Tobruk 1942.jpg|thumb|300px| The [[Battle of Gazala]] in May 1942, which was fought in the vicinity of Tobruk]]

Tobruk had a deep, natural, and protected harbour, which meant that even if the port were bombed, ships would still be able to anchor there and be safe from [[squall]]s, so the port could never be rendered wholly useless regardless of military [[bombardment]]. This was of critical importance, as it made Tobruk an excellent place to supply a [[desert warfare]] campaign. It was also heavily fortified by [[Italian Empire|the Italians]] prior to their invasion of Egypt in November 1940.

In addition to these prepared fortifications, there were a number of [[escarpment]]s and cliffs to the south of Tobruk, providing substantial physical barriers to any advance on the port over land. Tobruk was also on a peninsula, allowing it to be defended by a minimal number of troops, which the Allies used to their advantage when the port was under siege. An attacker could not simply bypass the defenders, for if they did, the besieged would [[sortie|sally forth]] and cut off the nearby [[supply line]]s of the attacker, spoiling their advance.

But Tobruk was also strategically significant, due to its location with regard to the remainder of Cyrenaica. Attackers from the east who had secured Tobruk could then advance through the desert to [[Benghazi]], cutting off all enemy troops along the coast, such as those at [[Derna, Libya|Derna]]. This advance would be protected from [[counterattack]], due to escarpments that were quite difficult for a military force to climb, running generally from Tobruk to [[Suluq]]. Due to the importance of maintaining [[logistics|supply]] in the desert, getting cut off in this area was disastrous. Therefore, whoever held both Suluq and Tobruk controlled the majority of Cyrenaica.

Finally, {{convert|24|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of the port was the largest airfield in eastern Libya.  This was significant due to the importance of [[air power]] in desert warfare.

====Italian advance====
Italian forces (and their native Libyan allies—about two [[Division (military)|divisions]] of the latter) [[Italian invasion of Egypt|invaded Egypt]] in early September 1940 but halted their advance after a week and dug in at [[Sidi Barrani]]. In early December, [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Empire]] forces—an armoured division and two infantry divisions—launched a counterstrike codenamed [[Operation Compass]]. The Italians had previously [[Italian invasion of Albania|invaded Albania]] and [[Italian-occupied France|occupied part of the south of France]], and had now made a military incursion into a British [[protectorate]].

====British capture of Tobruk====
{{main|British capture of Tobruk}}
The counterstrike involved the British pocketing two of the Italian camps against the Mediterranean, forcing their surrender. This led to a general Italian retreat to [[El Agheila]]. Tobruk was captured by British, Australian and Indian forces on 22 January 1941.

Italy called on her German ally, which sent an army [[corps]], under the name ''[[Deutsches Afrika Korps]]'' (DAK). Italy also sent several more divisions to Libya.  These forces, under Lieutenant-General [[Erwin Rommel]], drove the Allies back across Cyrenaica to the Egyptian border, leaving Tobruk isolated and [[siege of Tobruk|under siege]]. The defenders of the fortress consisted of the [[9th Division (Australia)|Australian 9th Division]], the [[7th Division (Australia)|Australian 18th Brigade]] and some British tanks and artillery. They were later reinforced and replaced by the [[British 70th Infantry Division]], [[Polish Independent Carpathian Rifle Brigade]], a [[Czechoslovak 11th Infantry Battalion|Czechoslovak battalion]] and a British tank brigade. The siege lasted until December, when [[Operation Crusader]] pushed the DAK and Italians back out of Cyrenaica.[[File:Smiling Indian Soldiers in Tobruk 1941.jpg|thumb|left|Smiling Indian Soldiers in Tobruk 1941]]

====German capture of Tobruk====
{{main|Axis capture of Tobruk}}
Rommel's second offensive took place in May and June 1942. Tobruk [[Battle of Gazala|was taken in an outflanking attack on 21 June 1942]], capturing the largest number of [[British Commonwealth]] troops after the [[Battle of Singapore|fall of Singapore]] earlier in the year, where over 80,000 were captured. Rommel was promoted to [[Generalfeldmarschall]], shortly thereafter and was the youngest in the [[Wehrmacht]] [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]] to achieve this rank. The following units were deployed in Tobruk on 20 June 1942, and most of them were captured by the Axis forces:<ref>{{cite book |last1=Agar-Hamilton |first1=J. A.

====British Commando raid====
A British raid on Tobruk on 13–14 September 1942, codenamed [[Operation Agreement]], intended to destroy port facilities and stores being used to support the Axis forces further west. Special forces approached from across the desert while [[Commandos (United Kingdom)|Commandos]] attacked from the sea. A preparatory air raid by RAF heavy bombers served only to alert the Italian and German defenders. The special forces were unable to silence the coastal artillery batteries and the seaborne assault had to be abandoned after some of the Commandos had been landed in the wrong place. The retiring vessels were then attacked from the air. The British sustained almost 800 casualties, together with a cruiser, two destroyers and several smaller ships and boats.<ref>{{Cite web|last=N.|first=Anthony|date=2013-02-07|title=Operation Agreement: Victory Over Allied Commando Forces|url=https://comandosupremo.com/operation-agreement/|access-date=2021-04-30|website=Comando Supremo|language=en-US}}</ref>

====British recapture====
Tobruk remained in Axis hands until 11 November 1942, when the Allies captured it after the [[Second Battle of El Alamein]]. It remained in Allied hands thereafter. Although not as much a reason for its strategic significance, the British built a rail line from [[El Alamein]] to Tobruk during the course of the war. This rail line was significant both for purposes of supply and as a sense of pride to the Allied troops, as the rail line was built through a little-populated, inhospitable desert.
