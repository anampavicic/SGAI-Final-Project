==History==
Founded as a fort called Tashauz in the early 19th century by the [[Russians]], the name was changed to the Turkmen form Dashkhovuz in 1992 after independence, and to Daşoguz by order of President [[Saparmurat Niyazov|Niyazov]] in 1999; the modern city has all characteristics of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] planning.<ref name=":052">{{Cite book|last=Brummell|first=Paul|title=Turkmenistan|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|year=2005|isbn=978-1-84162-144-9|pages=164, 167-168|language=en|author-link=Paul Brummell}}</ref> The etymology remains disputed.<ref name=":052" />

On September 5, 1998, an [[H chondrite|H5]] [[meteorite]] weighing approximately seven kilograms fell in Daşoguz.<ref>{{Cite web|title=H chondrite meteorites|url=http://www4.nau.edu/meteorite/Meteorite/H-Chond.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704153606/http://www4.nau.edu/meteorite/Meteorite/H-Chond.html|archive-date=2008-07-04|access-date=2007-04-13}}</ref>
