It borders [[Yantai]] to the west and the [[Yellow Sea]] to the east, and is the closest mainland Chinese city to [[South Korea]] (specifically, [[Chengshan]] to [[Yeonpyeongdo]]).

Compared with the 2,804,771 people in the [[2010 Chinese census]], there has been a total increase of 101,777 people over the past decade, an increase of 3.63%, with an average annual growth rate of 0.36%.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-06-09 |title=Announcement of the Seventh National Population Census of Weihai City |url=https://www.weihai.gov.cn/art/2021/6/9/art_58817_2610425.html |website=Weihai Municipal People's Government}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-03-31 |title=Population data of Weihai City |url=https://www.hongheiku.com/shandong/379.html |website=Red Black Kouku}}</ref> Weihai's population was 2,906,548 as of the [[2020 Chinese census]], of whom 1,164,730 lived in the current built-up (''or metro'') area of ([[Huancui District]]) even though [[Wendeng, Shandong|Wendeng]] district to the south with 563,529 inhabitants is soon being conurbated.

Prehistorically, it was inhabited by [[Dongyi]] tribes,<ref>{{Cite web |title=威海市人民政府 民俗方言 |url=http://www.weihai.gov.cn/col/col58861/index.html |access-date=2023-02-19 |website=www.weihai.gov.cn}}</ref> and it was annexed into [[China proper]] by the state of [[Qi (state)|Qi]] in 567 B.C.

Before the 14th century, Weihai was a minor fishing settlement. In 1398, during the [[Ming dynasty]], it became a military stronghold (''wei'') to defend against raids by the [[wokou]]. The fortification at Weihai was constructed in 1403, and contained walls almost 2 miles (3.2&nbsp;km) in circumference.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Weihai |title=Weihai, Encyclopædia Britannica Online |date=8 October 2015 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905223907/http://www.britannica.com/place/Weihai |archive-date=5 September 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Weihaiwei was the base for the [[Beiyang Fleet]] during the [[Qing Dynasty]]. In 1895, the Japanese captured it in the [[Battle of Weihaiwei]], which is regarded as the last major battle of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. The Japanese then evacuated Weihaiwei on 24 May 1898, after which it was occupied by the British.<ref name="auto">http://www.worldstatesmen.org/China_Foreign_colonies.html#Weihaiwei {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110420174121/http://www.worldstatesmen.org/China_Foreign_colonies.html |date=20 April 2011 }} WorldStatesMen - China - Foreign colonies - Weihaiwai</ref>

The core of Weihai (now [[Huancui District]]) was [[Weihaiwei under British rule|ruled by the British]] from 1 July 1898 to 1930 under lease agreement with the Chinese empire, with '''Port Edward''' (the center of the original Weihai city, now in Huancui District) serving as the capital.<ref name=":0" /> A [[Royal Navy]] base was built on [[Liugong Island]]. 

[[File:Wei-Hai-Wei (1906).jpg|thumb|200px|alt=refer to caption|Map of Weihaiwei in 1906]]

The region was formally incorporated into Shandong province on 10 May 1945.<ref name=region/>  In 1949, Weihaiwei City was established, and its name was shortened to Weihai after the [[Chinese Civil War|Communist revolution]].

Since 2003, a replica of the [[Chinese battleship Dingyuan|Chinese battleship ''Dingyuan'']] has been anchored here as a [[museum ship]] and memorial for Chinese veterans of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=“定远舰”沉舰遗物出水：沉没125年终被找到，图9文物锁定身份！_复制品 |url=https://www.sohu.com/a/382741316_120362718 |access-date=2024-10-20 |website=www.sohu.com}}</ref>

== Geography and climate ==

Weihai is located on the northeastern shore of Shandong; its administrative area includes {{ill|Chengshantou|zh|成山头}} ({{lang|zh-hans|成山头}}), the easternmost tip of the [[Shandong Peninsula]] (Shantung Peninsula). The city is surrounded by sea on three sides; its port is protected by [[Liugong Island]].

Weihai experiences a [[continental climate]], and it is climactically influenced by the surrounding [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[Siberian high]].Weihai City is located in the mid latitudes and belongs to the northern temperate monsoon continental climate, with significant seasonal changes and monsoon advance and retreat. Compared with inland areas at the same latitude, it has the characteristics of abundant rainfall, moderate annual temperature, and mild climate. <ref>{{Cite web |title=威海 - 气象数据 -中国天气网 |url=https://www.weather.com.cn/cityintro/101121301.shtml |access-date=2024-10-20 |website=www.weather.com.cn}}</ref>Springtime warming and autumn cooling are delayed by one month, winds are generally high, and the average diurnal temperature variation throughout the year is small—at only {{convert|6.73|C-change|1}}. Winters are cold and dry, but still warmer than inland regions at the same latitude; the average temperature in January is {{convert|−0.9|°C}}. Summers are hot and humid, but much cooler than inland regions at similar latitude like the [[North China Plain]] (for about 5~10°C) and August averages {{convert|24.7|°C|1}}; the annual mean is {{convert|12.48|°C|1}}. More than two-thirds of the annual precipitation occurs from June to September, and there are nearly 2,540 hours of sunshine per year.
