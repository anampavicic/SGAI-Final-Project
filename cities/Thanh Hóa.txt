'''Thanh Hóa''' ({{IPA|vi|tʰajŋ̟ hwǎː|lang|Thanh Hoa.ogg}}) is the capital of [[Thanh Hóa Province]].<ref>Robert Trando Letters of a Vietnamese Émigré -2010 Page 144 "The name of its city is Thanh Hóa City."</ref> The city is situated in the east of the province on the [[Ma River]] (Sông Mã), about 150 kilometers (93 miles) south of capital [[Hanoi]] and 1560 kilometers (969 miles) north of [[Ho Chi Minh City]]. Thanh Hoa became one of the most populous cities in [[North Central Coast]] after expanding in 2012{{Clarify|date=February 2017}}, with a population of approximately 400,000. Thanh Hoa township was upgraded to Thanh Hoa City in 1994 and has been the historical center of politics, economy, culture, education and entertainment of [[Thanh Hóa Province]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Overview==

''Thanh Hoá'' is a new developing city, although its central position was established centuries before. Nowadays, provincial administrators are trying to build and gentrify the city so that its important role for the whole province and even [[North Central Coast]] is emphasised.

==History==
The [[Citadel of the Hồ Dynasty]] was the capital of the [[Trần dynasty]] from 1398 to 1400 and the [[Hồ dynasty]] from 1400 to 1407.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1358|title = Citadel of the Ho Dynasty}}</ref>

The Thanh Hóa town and region were an area of popular support for [[Lê Lợi]] and the [[Lê dynasty]] in the 1580s,<ref>Keat Gin Ooi ''Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East ... '' Volume 1 - Page 805 2004 "Mac efforts notwithstanding, many people went south to support the restoration of the Le dynasty in Thanh Hoá. Throughout the sixteenth century, Mac-Le animosity was played out on the battlefield."</ref> leading to the reestablishment of the southern court near the town following the withdrawal of [[Ming dynasty]] armies.<ref>''Vietnam'' Insight Guides 2002 - Page 20 "The southern court is founded near Thanh Hoá. 1592: The death of Mac dynasty's last king, Mac Mau Hop, ends the war."</ref> After 1945 the city was a stronghold of the Communist-led [[Viet Minh]]. In January 1946 the Viet Minh transported all local cells of the VNQDD to the city.<ref>Van Dao Hoang ''Viet Nam Quoc Dan Dang: A Contemporary History of a National Struggle: 1927-1954'' 2008 Page 331 "Afterward, the VC transported all Party members and their weapons to Thanh Hóa city."</ref> During the [[Vietnam War]], US strategic bombing destroyed much of the buildings and infrastructure; the whole city has been totally rebuilt since then.
