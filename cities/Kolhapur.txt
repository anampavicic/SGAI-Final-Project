'''Kolhapur''' ({{Audio|Kolhapur.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a city on the banks of the [[Panchganga River]] in the southern part of the Indian state of [[Maharashtra]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Karade|first=Jagan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CIGEAAAQBAJ&dq=history+of+kolhapur&pg=PA57|title=Occupational Mobility among Scheduled Castes|date=2020-10-27|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=978-1-5275-6131-1}}</ref>

Kolhapur is one of the most significant cities in South Maharashtra and has been a hub of historical, religious, and cultural activities for centuries. It is famous for its unique food culture, including its signature Kolhapuri cuisine. The city is situated in the western part of Maharashtra and is often referred to as "Dakshin Kashi" or "Mahateerth". It boasts a rich history, which has given it various other names, including Kollagiri, Kolladigiripattan and Kollpur, all meaning "valley" {{Citation needed|reason=This paragraph in this entirety is lacking citations.|date=August 2023}} Around 2 CE Kolhapur's name was 'Kuntal'.<ref name="B">{{Cite book |title= History and Sociology class sixth|publisher=Maharashtra rajya pathyapustak nirmiti va sanshodhak mandal, Pune |year=2021 |edition=5th |location=Mudra vibhag, Pathyapustak madal, Pune |pages=44 |language=mr |script-title=mr : इतिहास व नागरिकशास्त्र इयत्ता सहावी |trans-title=History and Sociology class sixth}}</ref>

Kolhapur is known as '''Dakshin Kashi''<nowiki/>' or Kashi of the South because of its spiritual history and the antiquity of its shrine Mahalaxmi, better known as [[Mahalakshmi Temple, Kolhapur|Ambabai]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Suresh|first=B.

Before India became independent in 1947, Kolhapur was a [[princely state]] under the [[Bhosale]] [[Chhatrapati]] of the [[Maratha Confederacy]]. It is an important centre for the [[Marathi cinema|Marathi film]] industry.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kulkarni|first=Sripad Rao Laxman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ej8jEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA92|title=Bharata Darshana|date=2021-03-01|publisher=Leela Prakashana}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Kolhapur is named after Kolhasur, a demon in [[History of Hinduism|Hindu History]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Malgonkar|first=Manohar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h1ADAAAAMAAJ|title=Chhatrapatis of Kolhapur|date=1971|publisher=Popular Prakashan|pages=2}}</ref> According to legend, the demon Kolhasur renounced asceticism after his sons were killed by the gods for harassing people. He prayed to [[Lakshmi|Mahalakshmi]], requesting that she leave the area to him for a hundred years. He committed numerous crimes during this period until the goddess returned after the hundred years were over and killed him for his sins.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Doniger|first=Wendy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-kZFzHCuiFAC&pg=PA178|title=Purana Perennis: Reciprocity and Transformation in Hindu and Jaina Texts|date=1993-01-01|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-1381-4|pages=178}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|title=Mythology|url=http://www.ambabai.com/mythology.html|access-date=2018-02-19|website=Ambabai Mahalaxmi Kolhapur}}</ref> Kolhasur's dying wish was to name the place after him, a request granted, and the area was named Kolhapur. 'Kolha' represents Kolhasur, and 'pur,' a Sanskrit word, means 'city.'<ref name=":1" />

Stone inscriptions from the Shilahar kingdom, which ruled this region from 8–12 C.A.D., mention this area as 'kshullakpur' (the first stage of Jain monkhood) and 'Kalapuri,' a city with beautifully carved temples. This historical information is preserved in Shilahar-era ancient Jain matha and temples near the Ambabai temple.

==History==
[[File:Mahalaxmi of Kolhapur.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Mahalakshmi Temple (Kolhapur)|Mahalakshmi]], Hindu goddess]]

===Mediaeval era===
The [[Shilahara]] family founded a dynasty at Kolhapur about the time of the downfall of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta Empire]], that ruled over southern [[Maharashtra]] including the modern districts of [[Satara district|Satara]], Kolhapur and [[Belgaum|Belagavi (Karnataka)]]. Their family deity was the goddess [[Ambabai]], whose blessing they claimed to have secured in their copperplate grants (''Mahalakshmi-labdha-vara-prasada''). Like their relatives of the northern branch of [[Konkan]], the Shilaharas of Kolhapur claimed to be of the lineage of Vidyadhara Jimutavahana, a [[Jain]] scholar. Their banner featured a golden [[Garuda]]. One of the many titles used by the Shilaharas was ''Tagarapuravaradhisvara'', supreme sovereign ruler of Tagara.
 
The first capital of the Shilaharas was probably at [[Karad]] during the reign of [[Jatiga II]], as known from their copper plate grant of [[Miraj]] and 'Vikramankadevacharita' of [[Bilhana]]. Hence, they are referred to sometimes as the 'Shilaharas of Karad'.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wf0MAQAAMAAJ|title=Bombay Geographical Magazine|date=1953|publisher=Bombay Geographical Association.|pages=7}}</ref> Later, although the capital was shifted to Kolhapur, some of their grants mention Valavada and the hill fort of Pranalaka or Padmanala (Panhala) as the places of royal residence. Karhad retained its significance during the Shilahara period. This branch rose to power in the latter part of the [[Rashtrakuta dynasty|Rashtrakuta]] rule and unlike the kings of the other two branches, this branch does not allude to the genealogy of the Rashtrakutas even in their early grants. They acknowledged the suzerainty of the later [[Chalukya dynasty]] for some time. They had used [[Kannada]] as an official language as can be seen from their inscriptions. The branch held southern Maharashtra from circa 940 to 1220.
 
From 940 to 1212 CE, Kolhapur was the centre of power of the [[Shilahara]] dynasty.<ref>Bhavan B. V. "Temples and legends of Maharashtra." 1962 volume 97.</ref> An inscription at [[Terdal]] states that the king [[Gonka]] (1020 – 1050 CE) was bitten by a snake then healed by a [[Jainism|Jain]] monk. Gonka then built a temple to Lord [[Neminath]], the twenty-second Jain [[tirthankara]] (enlightened being). From this era, Jain temples in and around Kolhapur are called ''Gonka-Jinalaya''.

Around 1055 CE, during the reign of [[Bhoja I]] (Shilahara dynasty), a dynamic [[Acharya]] (spiritual guide) named Maghanandi (Kolapuriya) founded a religious institute at the Rupanarayana [[Jain]] temple ([[basadi]]). Maghanandi is also known as ''Siddhanta-Chakravarti'', meaning ''the great master of the scriptures''. Kings and nobles of the Shilahara dynasty such as [[Gandaraditya I]], who succeeded [[Bhoja I]], were disciples of Maghanandi.

Kolhapur was the site of intense confrontation between the [[Western Chalukya Empire]] and [[Rajadhiraja Chola]] and his younger brother [[Rajendra Chola II]] of the [[Chola empire]]. In 1052 CE, following the [[Battle of Koppam]], the victor, Rajendra Chola II, marched on to Kolhapur and erected a ''jayastambha'' (victory pillar).<ref name="Sastri (1935)">
Sastri K. A. N. "The CōĻas." 1935 p. 256–257 (University of Madras, 2000).</ref>

Between 1109 and 1178 CE, the [[Kopeshwar temple]] to Lord [[Shiva]] was built by [[Shilahara]] kings, [[Gandaraditya I]], [[Vijayaditya]], and [[Bhoja II (Shilahara dynasty)|Bhoja II]] in Khidrapur, Kolhapur.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kanhere |first1=Gopal Krishna |title=The Temples of Maharashtra |date=1989 |publisher=Maharashtra Information Centre (Directorate-General of Information and Public Relations, Bombay), Government of Maharashtra |pages=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpwjAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>

===Kolhapur State===
[[File:Maharajah of Kolhapur 1912.jpg|thumb|Chhatrapati Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj, Maharajah of Kolhapur]]
{{Main|Kolhapur State}}
The [[Kolhapur State|state of Kolhapur]] was established by [[Tarabai]] in 1707 in the midst of a succession dispute over the Maratha crown. The Maratha throne was then occupied by descendants of Tarabai. One of the prominent Kings was Rajarshi Shahu Maharaj ([[Shahu of Kolhapur]]). In his reign, he promoted free education to people of all castes, religions and fought against untouchability. The state was annexed by the British in the 19th century. After India's independence in 1947, the Maharaja of Kolhapur acceded to the Dominion of India on 14 August 1947 and merged with [[Bombay State]] on 1 March 1949. Kolhapur is sometimes found spelled as ''Colapore''.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hertslet's Commercial Treaties|date=1900|publisher=Foreign Office, Great Britain|location=Great Britain|pages=1167|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SBUfAQAAMAAJ&q=Colapore&pg=PA1167|access-date=7 September 2015}}</ref> Often, Kolhapur is also referred as ''Dakshin Kashi'' or the [[Varanasi|Kashi]] of the South, due to its rich religious history.

===Scriptural references===
Kolhapur is mentioned in the ''Devi Gita'', the final chapter of the ''[[Devi-Bhagavata Purana]]'', a text of [[Shaktism]]. Kolhapur is noted as a place of ''Kollamma'' worship. In the text, [[Devi]] says,
:"O King of Mountains! Still I am now telling something out of My affection to My [[Bhakta]]s. Hear. There is a great place of pilgrimage named ''Kollapura'' in the southern country. Here the [[Ambabai|Devi Ambabai]] always dwells."<ref>Chatterji H. P. [http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/dg/dg08.htm "Devi Gita, the vow and the sacred places of the Devi."]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012124820/http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/dg/dg08.htm|date=12 October 2013}} ''The Devi Gita (Song of the Goddess)'', excerpt from ''Srimad Devi Bhagawatam'', translated by the Vijnanananda (Hari Prasanna Chatterji), 1921, chapter 38 verse 3 – 10. "O King of Mountains! Still I am now telling something out of My affection to My Bhaktas. Hear. There is a great place of pilgrimage named Kolhapura in the southern country. Here the Devi Ambabai always dwells. The second place is Mahur, Maharashtra|Matripura in the Sahyadri mountain; here the Devi Renuka dwells."</ref>

===Hydrology===
The [[Panchganga River]] originates in the Western Ghats. It has five tributaries which supply the city and surroundings – the Bhogavati, Tulsi, Kumbhi, Kasari and Dhamani rivers. Kolhapur has a number of lakes. The [[Rankala Lake]] was once a stone quarry.

The Kalamba lake was built in 1873. These two lakes provide the city with domestic [[potable]] water. {{wide image|Rankala lake panorama.jpg|1000px|Rankala lake panorama}}

{{Main|Kolhapur Municipal Corporation}}
Kolhapur is governed by the [[Kolhapur Municipal Corporation]] (KMC). The city is divided into five wards, named with the letters A to E. The corporation provides services such as [[sewage]] treatment and free cremation for residents and has made a number of improvements, for example, the Kolhapur Road Project,<ref name="Road">[http://www.kolhapurcorporation.gov.in/IRDP4.html "Kolhapur Road Project."] Government of India website. Retrieved 12 September 2017.</ref> the Anti-Encroachment Drive to stop illegal building activity encroaching on the city's open spaces, and the ''Suvarna Jayanti Nagarotthan'' Project to improve roads and storm water management.<ref name="Suvarna">[http://www.kolhapurcorporation.gov.in/pdf/short_note_nagarothan_abhiyan_road_and_strom_water.pdf "Kolhapur Nagarothan Abhiya."] Kolhapur Municipal Corporation website.
