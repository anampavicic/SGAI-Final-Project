==History==
===Prehispanic History===

The area around [[Xochicalco]] (In the place of the House of Flowers) was settled in about 200 BCE, although the city reached its apex between AD 650 and 900.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://morelosturistico.com/espanol/pagina/z_22_Piramides_de_Xochicalco.php|title=Píramides de Xochicalco|newspaper=Turismo en Morelos |publisher=Morelos Turistico|accessdate=April 13, 2019|language=Spanish|trans-title=Pyramids of Xochicalco|author1=Mexicoxp }}</ref> Xochicalco was mentioned by Fray [[Bernardino de Sahagún]] in the 16th century, and it may have been settled by refugees from [[Teotihuacan]].<ref name=lugares>{{cite web|url=https://lugares.inah.gob.mx/es/inicio/opinion/1753-xochicalco.html|title=Xochicalco|publisher=INAH|accessdate=April 13, 2019|language=Spanish}}</ref> The city traded with populations in Oaxaca, the Yucatán Peninsula, and the Gulf of Mexico. According to [[Rock art|petrographs]] found in the ''Templo de las Serpientes Emplumadas'', (Temple of the Feathered Serpents) Xochicalco hosted a meeting with representatives from the Maya area, the Gulf Coast, and Oaxaca to adjust the calendar during a [[solar eclipse]] while Xochicalco was at its splendor.<ref name=lugares />

In about A.D. 830, the Nahuatl-speaking emigrated to the area south of the mountains of Ajusco, in what is the state of Morelos today. At the time of the formation of the [[Aztec Empire|Triple Alliance]] (1428), the only communities in the modern-day municipality of Temixco were ''Acatlipa'' and ''Cuentepec''.<ref name=mimunicipio>{{cite web|url=https://www.mimunicipio.com.mx/historia/Morelos/Temixco/|title=Historia Temixco Morelos|publisher=Mi Municipio|accessdate=April 13, 2019|language=Spanish|trans-title=History of Temixco, Morelos}}</ref>

===Colonial Era===

After the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish conquest]] of 1521, [[Hernán Cortés]] was granted the title [[Marquisate of the Valley of Oaxaca|Marqués del Valle de Oaxaca]] including almost all of modern [[Morelos]]. The villages of Temixco were Acatlipa, San Agustín Tetlama, and San Sebastián Cuentepec.<ref name=mimunicipio />

[[Martín Cortés, 2nd Marquis of the Valley of Oaxaca]] granted lands to religious orders and wealthy Spanish were able to establish the first sugar-cane plantations or ''haciendas''. On July 29. 1617, Don Francisco Barbero of Copaltepeque established the ''Hacienda of Temixco'' on 1,755 hectares of land. Later, additional land was purchased from the native peoples. The first installation was the sugar press (''trapiche''), and at the beginning of the 18th century, it became an ''ingenio'' for production of sugar, rum, alcohol and other products. Other small presses were established at ''Rivas'', ''Tomalaca'', and ''San José''. The hacienda took the name ''Nuestra Señora de la Concepción'' (Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception).<ref name=mimunicipio />

The owner of the hacienda, Miguel de Zia, seized land in [[Xochitepec]] and Alpuyeca in 1715 with the support of Fray Simón Roa of the [[Spanish Inquisition|Holy Inquisition]]. In 1719 the people of these communities complained, but Xochitepec never recovered its land. Indigenous of Alpuyeca rose against the hacienda in 1747, only to be arrested by Fray Miguel de Nava of Cuernavaca.<ref name=mimunicipio />

===19th Century===

In 1808, don [[`Gabriel J. de Yermo|Gabriel Joaquín de Yermo]] celebrated his wife's birthday by freeing 200 slaves from his hacienda in Temixco. This is why so few Black people participated in the Independence movement of 1810 but took the side of the Spanish.<ref name=mimunicipio />

Yermo led the September 15, 1808 ''golpe de estado'' (French & English: ''[[Coup d'état]]'') against Viceroy [[José de Iturrigaray]], who was replaced the following day by Viceroy [[Pedro de Garibay]], ending the [[Criollo people|criollos']] [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|"Patriotas de Fernando VII"]] attempt to legally achieve independence. When the [[Mexican War of Independence]] broke out in 1810, Gabriel Joaquín de Yermo converted the hacienda into a supply center for the Royalists.<ref name=mimunicipio />

The [[State of Mexico]] was created in 1824, and the District of [[Cuernavaca]] was formed. The hacienda of Temixco was included in the municipality of [[Xochitepec]] within the District of Cuernavaca. Temixco became part of the [[State of Morelos]] when it was formed on April 17, 1869.<ref name=mimunicipio />

===20th Century===

There were two battles in the hacienda of Temixco in [[Mexican Revolution|1914]]. The first was on May 26, when the [[Liberation Army of the South|Zapatistas]] was able to take the hacienda, and the second was in early June when the Zapatistas used the hacienda as a staging ground for the Siege of Cuernavaca.<ref name=mimunicipio /> In 1915, once the Zapatistas took control of Mexico City, they confiscated all the ruined alcohol distilleries. Gral. [[Genovevo de la O]] was assigned to get Temixco running again.<ref name=mimunicipio />

In 1921 Temixco was elevated to the category of "Congregación" and the town took the name ''Real de Temixco''. It was part of the municipality of Cuernavaca. The [[Ejido|Ejido de Temixco]] was formed in 1924.<ref name=inafed>{{cite web |url=http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM17morelos/municipios/17018a.html|title=Morelos — Temixco|publisher=Enciclopedia de los Municipios y Delegaciones de Mexico|accessdate=April 13, 2019|language=Spanish}}</ref>

The Municipality of Temixco was created on March 5, [[1933 in Mexico|1933]], including the towns of Tetlama, Cuentepec, Acatlipa, and Temixco.<ref name=inafed />
[[File:Temixco - Alta Palmira 0222.jpg|thumb|right|Alta Palmira from ''[[Mexican Federal Highway 95D|Autopista del Sol]]'']]

On December 8, 1935, the ''Pueblo Nuevo del Puente (Alta Palmira)'' was established in Cuernavaca. In 1956 it was transferred to Temixco.<ref name=mimunicipio />

In the 1940s the ''Comité Japonés de Ayuda Mutua'' (CJAM; "Japanese Committee of Mutual Aid"), a [[Japanese Mexicans|Japanese-Mexican]] organization based in Mexico City, obtained a hacienda on {{convert|200|ha|acre}} of land in Temixco from Alejandro Lacy so it could house newly-arriving Japanese coming from other parts of Mexico.<ref name=Garciap174/> In 1942, during World War II, the hacienda of Temixco became a concentration camp.<ref name=rotativo>{{citation|url=https://rotativo.com.mx/turismo/641325-exhacienda-temixco-guarda-una-parte-la-historia-mexico/|title=Exhacienda de Temixco guarda una parte de la historia de México|newspaper=Diario Rotativo|location=Queretero|date=August 19, 2017|accessdate=April 13, 2019|language=Spanish|trans-title=Exhacienda de Temixco keeps a part of the history of Mexico}}</ref> The Japanese had moved in by 1943.<ref name=Garciap183>García, Jerry.

The Hacienda of Temixco continued to cultivate sugar cane until 1968 when it became a water park. Today it includes swimming pools, a wave pool, a river, and athletic fields.<ref name=rotativo />

Due to migration from other states, the population of Temixco grew quickly in the 1970s, and new colonies such as [[Rubén Jaramillo]], Lomas de Guadalupe, 10 de Abril, and La Azteca were added. The town of ''Pueblo Viejo'' which previously belonged to Cuernavaca, became a part of Temixco in 1990.<ref name=mimunicipio />

The [[Cuernavaca Airport|General Mariano Matamoros Airport]] opened on April 15, [[1988 in Mexico|1988]] under control of the [[State of Morelos]] and came under federal control in 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aeropuertodecuernavaca.com.mx/antecedentes.html|title=Aeropuerto Internacional de Cuernavaca: Antecedentes|accessdate=April 12, 2019|publisher=Aeropuerto de Cuernavaca|language=es}}</ref>

Temixco was elevated to the status of ''ciudad'' ([[city]]) on March 7, [[1990 in Mexico|1990]].

===21st Century===

Construction on a bridge to connect [[Mexican Federal Highway 95D]] in Apatlaco, [[Ciudad Ayala|Ayala]] and the [[Cuernavaca Airport]] in Temixco was begun in 2012 and the project ended in November 2012. As of this writing (April [[2019 in Mexico|2019]]), the bridge is incomplete and there is no connection to Temixco.<ref>{{citation|url=https://www.diariodemorelos.com/noticias/elefante-blanco-el-puente-apatlaco|title='Elefante blanco', el puente Apatlaco|newspaper=El Diario de Morelos|location=Cuernavaca|last=Soberanes|first=Carlos|date=March 28, 2019|accessdate=April 13, 2019|language=Spanish|trans-title=The Apatlaco bridge is a "White Elephant"}}</ref>

Temixco has been plagued by violence during much of the 21st century.

====Historical Monuments====

* Ruinas de [[Xochicalco]] archaeological site located in the municipalities of Temixco and Miacatlan. [[Xochicalco]] is an example from the Epiclasico Period (AD 700-900) characterized by the development of cities in central Mexico after the fall of [[Teotihuacan]] as well as migrations from both the north and south of Mexico, such as the collapse of three Mayan cities. The reliefs on the Temple of the Plumed Serpent reflect influences from both Teotihuacan and Mayan influences. Its location at the top of a hill suggests it was built during a time of political unrest. The solar observatory is open for 150 days beginning April 30. There is a museum and parking is available. The site can also be reached via public transportation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inah.gob.mx/zonas/13-zona-arqueologica-de-xochicalco|title=Zona Arqueológica de Xochicalco}}</ref>
