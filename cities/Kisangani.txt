Before [[Henry Morton Stanley]], working on behalf of [[Leopold II of the Belgians|King Leopold II of the Belgians]], founded what would become Stanley Falls Station in 1883, the area was inhabited by [[Wagenya]], who used [[Wagenia Falls]] (which was formerly named Stanley Falls) for fishing.<ref name=":22">{{Cite book |last=Boya |first=Loso Kiteti |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hpi4lyWG7zwC |title=D.R.

Initially referred to as Falls Station or "The Post Stanley Falls," "The Falls," or colloquially "Boyoma" (the indigenous name for [[Boyoma Falls]]), the settlement was consistently identified as "Kisangani" by the local populace, while Europeans commonly used the [[French language|French]] term "Stanleyville" (or Stanleystad in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]).<ref name=":14">{{Cite web |title=Histoire |url=https://www.stanleyville.be/histoire.html |access-date=13 August 2024 |website=www.stanleyville.be |language=fr}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{cite web |title=CongoForum |url=http://www.congoforum.be/fr/congodetail.asp?subitem=20&id=36653&Congofiche=selected |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133531/http://www.congoforum.be/fr/congodetail.asp?subitem=20&id=36653&Congofiche=selected |archive-date=6 July 2011 |access-date=2015-03-01 |publisher=Congoforum.be}}</ref><ref name=":5">Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Kisangani Kisangani] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190327151031/https://www.britannica.com/place/Kisangani|date=27 March 2019}}, britannica.com, USA, accessed on 7 July 2019</ref> The [[Swahili language]] manual published by the [[Marist Brothers]] in the 1920s provides an instance of this naming substitution: "from X to Stanleyville" is translated as "toka X Mpaka Kisangani".<ref name=":14" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Nembenze |first=Désiré Balabala |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i5xODwAAQBAJ |title=L'encadrement juridique de l'éducation au Congo-Kinshasa (1885-1986): De l'initiative des missionnaires à la prise en charge par l'Etat |date=27 February 2018 |publisher=Éditions L'Harmattan |isbn=978-2-14-007540-7 |location=Paris, France |pages=55 |language=fr |trans-title=The legal framework for education in Congo-Kinshasa (1885-1986): From the initiative of missionaries to support by the State}}</ref><ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5" /> The name "Kisangani" is a Swahili interpretation of the indigenous term ''Boyoma'', denoting "City on the Island," and is similarly rendered in [[Lingala]] as ''Singitini'' (or ''Singatini'').<ref name=":14" /><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_00AAAAMAAJ&q=Kisangani%20Singitini |title=The Encyclopedia Americana, Volume 16 |date=2000 |publisher=Grolier |isbn=978-0-7172-0133-4 |location=Danbury, Connecticut, United States |pages=484 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Cookson |first=John |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0Q1AQAAIAAJ&q=Kisangani%20Singitini |title=Before the African Storm |date=1954 |publisher=Bobbs-Merrill |location=Indianapolis, Indiana, United States |pages=100 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":5" /> Stanley subsequently journeyed to Bas-Congo (modern-day [[Kongo Central|Kongo Central Province]]) and entrusted the settlement to Adrian Binnie, who, alongside twenty [[Hausa people|Hausa]] and ten Wangwana, became the principal representative of King Leopold II's [[Congo Free State]] in the region.<ref name=":16" /><ref>{{Cite book |last=Butcher |first=Tim |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEuLVyxxcnkC |title=Blood River: The Terrifying Journey through the World's Most Dangerous Country |date=15 September 2009 |publisher=Grove Atlantic |isbn=978-1-55584-909-2 |location=New York, New York, United States |pages=283 |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":15">{{Cite book |last=Jeal |first=Tim |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j6XymwBhAO8C&dq=Adrien+Binnie+Stanley+Falls&pg=RA1-PT127 |title=Stanley: Africa's Greatest Explorer |date=6 October 2011 |publisher=Faber & Faber |isbn=978-0-571-26564-0 |location=London, England, United Kingdom |language=en}}</ref> Binnie expanded Stanley's holdings, clearing land and constructing a village, complete with gardens.<ref name=":32" />

=== Congo Arab War ===
{{Further information|Congo Arab war}}
Following the establishment of relations between the local African communities and European traders, Arab-Swahili slave traders from [[Zanzibar]]—commonly referred to as "Arabs" in contemporary European accounts—reached Stanley Falls from the east. Relations between Free State officials and the slavers were fraught with tension.<ref name=":32" /> In October 1884, Lieutenant [[Arvid Wester]], who had succeeded Binnie as the station's overseer, brokered a treaty with the Arab Swahili slavers.<ref name=":32" /> The treaty, signed by a son of the infamous [[Afro-Omanis]] slave trader [[Tippu Tip]], was intended to curb [[slave raiding]] and foster peaceful relations with whites in the region.<ref name=":32" /> However, the treaty was short-lived, as Tippu Tip's forces soon resumed their activities, which exacerbated tensions. The natives simultaneously placed themselves under the protection of the [[International Association of the Congo]], albeit without success.<ref name=":32" />
[[File:Manyema.jpg|thumb|[[Manyema]] settlement in 1876, whose forces crossed from the mainland and attacked the Stanley Falls Station.]]
By January 1885, Captain [[Alphonse van Gèle]] arrived at Stanley Falls, following his exploration of the [[Ubangi River]], only to discover that Tippu Tip had devastated the surrounding area and, on behalf of the [[Sultanate of Zanzibar|Sultan of Zanzibar]], repudiated the treaty.<ref name=":32" /> This incident marked the onset of the [[Congo Arab war|Congo Arab War]], during which the eastern shore of the Congo Free State became a battleground for control over the lucrative [[Arab slave trade]].<ref name=":32" /> To protect Stanley Falls Station, Walter Deane, an officer dispatched by [[Francis de Winton]], arrived with a contingent of thirty-two Hausa soldiers and forty [[Bangala language|Bangala]] auxiliaries.<ref name=":32" /><ref name=":15" /> Although they were promised an ample supply of ammunition and reinforcements, these resources never materialized. The situation deteriorated in mid-July 1886 with the return of Tippu Tip to Zanzibar, leaving his brother-in-law and business partner, Bwana Nzige, and Nzige's son, Rashid, to oversee their operations in the region.<ref name=":32" /> When an enslaved woman from a nearby village, who had been cruelly flogged by her Arab Swahili master, sought refuge in Deane's camp, tensions reached a boiling point. Deane refused to return the woman to her master, offering to pay her ransom instead.<ref name=":32" /> This act of defiance incited Tippu Tip's men, who accused Deane of stealing the woman.<ref name=":32" /> Although threatened, Deane was not immediately attacked until the arrival of a river steamer, which brought only one Belgian officer, Lieutenant Dubois, but none of the promised reinforcements or supplies.<ref name=":32" /> A large force of [[Manyema]] crossed from the mainland at night to assault the station.<ref name=":32" /> Despite holding out for three days, the defenders were eventually overwhelmed as their ammunition dwindled, resulting in the deaths of seven Hausas, while the Bangala auxiliaries fled, promising to inform the authorities as they retreated [[downriver]].<ref name=":32" /> On 26 August 1886, Deane and Dubois set fire to the station and sought refuge in the surrounding woods. Dubois drowned while attempting to cross to the mainland, while the remaining survivors endured thirty days in the wilderness until they were finally rescued by Captain [[Camille Coquilhat]].<ref name=":32" />

=== Establishment of Stanleyville and Kisangani ===

[[File:Kisangani_Stanley_Falls_Station.jpg|thumb|Stanley Falls Station, map plan in 1893, laying the foundations of Kisangani]]
On 3 September 1886, Administrator General [[Camille Janssen]] issued a decree establishing nine districts within the colony, including [[Stanley Falls District]], each governed by a district commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Etat Indépendant du Congo |date=1886 |title=Bulletin Officiel: années 1885 et 1886 |url=https://www.kaowarsom.be/documents/BOC/BOEIC1885-86.pdf |access-date=10 August 2024 |publisher=P. Weissenbruch |language=fr |publication-place=Brussels, Belgium}}</ref> In 1887, Stanley proposed Tippu Tip as the governor (''wali'') of the Stanley Falls District, a proposal accepted by both Leopold II and [[Barghash bin Said of Zanzibar|Barghash bin Said]]. Tippu Tip assumed the position on 24 February 1887, and Stanley Falls District remained under Arab control until June 1888.<ref name=":32" /><ref name=":14" /> However, hostilities resumed, and Arab Swahili influence in Stanley Falls District was not decisively eliminated until 1893.<ref name=":32" /> On 15 July 1898, the Governor General decreed that the Stanley Falls District would henceforth be called the [[Orientale Province|Eastern Province]] (''Province Orientale''), with Stanleyville designated as its capital.<ref name=":12" /> The city evolved into a significant terminus for steamer navigation on the Congo River, transforming from a modest trading post into a burgeoning urban center and serving as the headquarters for the entire eastern Congo Free State, including [[Katanga Province|Katanga]] and [[Kivu]], for several years until 1933.<ref name=":11" /> However, Stanleyville remained an underdeveloped administrative hub surrounded by native Congolese villages.<ref name=":11" /> As noted by [[Bogumil Jewsiewicki]]'s "According to the testimony of the age",<blockquote>"The villages of the Arabs, Kisangani-Singitini, as well as those of the Wagenya and the [[Kele people (Congo)|Lokeles]] around the Falls appear prosperous.

In early 1964, the [[Simba Rebellion]] ("Simba Revolution") occurred, mushrooming into outright rebellion by May and June. By August rebels had overrun Stanleyville from their bases in Wanie Rukula. They closed the airport and barred civilians from leaving, including at least one foreign consular staff.<ref name="Hoare2">''Congo Mercenary,'' London: Hale (1967), {{ISBN|0-7090-4375-9}}; Boulder, CO: Paladin Press (reissue 2008, with new foreword), {{ISBN|978-1-58160-639-3}}</ref> A number of American and European nationals were taken captive, and, following intense negotiations, [[Operation Dragon Rouge]] was launched by Belgium, the [[Armée Nationale Congolaise]] (ANC), and a plethora of foreign mercenaries under Colonel [[Mike Hoare]] to free the hostages.

Following [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s ascension to power, on 3 May 1966, Stanleyville was renamed Kisangani as part of his ''[[Authenticité (Zaire)|authenticité]]'' policies,<ref name=":12" /><ref>Emizet Francois Kisangani, ''Historical Dictionary of the Democratic Republic of the Congo'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2016, p. 279</ref> decreeing it the headquarters of the third economic center of [[Zaire]], after [[Kinshasa]] and [[Lubumbashi]].<ref name=":11" /> Between 1966 and 1967, Kisangani was the site of the [[Stanleyville mutinies]], which resulted in widespread looting. As Mobutu's ''authenticité''-driven [[Ideocracy|state ideology]] persisted throughout the 1970s, Stanley Falls was officially renamed [[Boyoma Falls]]. On 27 October 1977, the communes were renamed as follows: Belgian I (Mangobo and Tshopo), Belgian II (Lubunga), Brussels ([[Kabondo, Kisangani|Kabondo]]), and Stanley (Makiso).<ref>Sources : Wikipedia 2007, Monuc 2006, Guy De Boeck et Jean-Pierre Sonck</ref> By 1984, the city had a population of 317,581.<ref name=":12" />

===Regional conflicts===
In the 1990s, the area emerged as the theatre for a series of major battles known as the fight of Kisangani during the [[First Congo War]]. [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], leader of the [[Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]], invaded the Congo from the eastern region of the country with assistance from [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]] and [[Uganda]] military forces. As of 30 October 1998, there were 15,000 Ugandan and 19,000 Rwandan troops on Congolese soil. [[Laurent Kabila]] designated Kisangani as the forward base for the foreign forces as he marched westwards towards [[Kinshasa]] to overthrow [[Mobutu Sese Seko]].

The alliance of foreign military forces disintegrated when people of [[Hutu]] descent were massacred by the thousands in western Zaire and because of looting in the mining areas, in particular in Kisangani and the [[Kivus]]. The population was completely opposed to the presence of foreign forces because of their behaviour. [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] could not continue to support the use of Kisangani as the base for foreign fighters as they launched attacks to massacre the Hutu people – hence he demanded that Rwanda pull its forces out of the country.

In 1999, the city was the site of the first open fighting between Ugandan and Rwandan forces in the [[Second Congo War]], when nearly 3,000 people died in the cross fire. This followed the fracturing of the anti-government rebel group [[Rally for Congolese Democracy]] (RCD) into camps based in Kisangani and [[Goma]]. The fighting was also over the gold mines near the town. The local population was caught in the cross fire between Ugandan and Rwandan military forces, which led to the destruction of about a quarter of the city. Various buildings were damaged, most notably the roof of the Cathedral Rosaire of Notre-Dame, which was ignited by missiles. Both of the foreign forces were reported to have looted and pillaged the city. Despite the condemnation of Uganda by the International Court of Justice, establishment of responsibility, payment of compensation, and arrests have yet to be made.<ref name="societecivile1">{{cite web |url=http://www.societecivile.cd/node/3840 |title=Participation active à la reconstruction de la Ville de Kisangani/RDC |publisher=societecivile.cd |access-date=2015-03-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222012643/http://www.societecivile.cd/node/3840 |archive-date=22 December 2013}}</ref>
Further [[Six-Day War (2000)|clashes]] between Rwandan and Ugandan forces led to thousands more deaths and widespread destruction from 5 to 10 June 2000.

During the [[Second Congo War]], on 14 May 2002, 160 people were massacred in Kisangani; this is believed to be the work of those under the command of [[Laurent Nkunda]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/02/01/dr-congo-arrest-laurent-nkunda-war-crimes |title=D.R.

The soil in Kisangani is typical of the central [[Congo Basin]], characterized by red [[ochre]] [[Ferrallitisation|ferralitic]] soils, also known as [[Oxisol|Ferralsols]] or [[Oxisol|Oxisols]].<ref name=":8" /> These soils are known for their considerable thickness, red to yellow coloring, and [[Acid|acidic]] [[pH]] (less than 6).<ref name=":8" /> The low [[Silicon dioxide|silica]] [[sesquioxide]] ratio of the [[clay]] fraction, coupled with a low cation exchange capacity and primary [[mineral]] content, results in a soil with low clay activity and soluble element content, yet exhibiting fairly good stability of aggregates.<ref name=":8" />

===Climate===
Despite being adjacent to the equator, the city has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] due to the fact that its driest month (January) sees on average below 60&nbsp;mm of rain.

Typical climate in regions through which the [[Congo River]] flows is that of Kisangani, a town situated on the river's right and left bank slightly north of the [[Equator]]. Humidity is high throughout the year, and annual rainfall amounts to {{convert|1620|mm}} and occurs fairly regularly; even in the driest month, the rainfall totals more than {{convert|53|mm}}. Temperatures are also uniformly high throughout the year, and there is little diurnal variability. The average temperature at Kisangani is in the mid-20s°C (mid-70s°F). Kisangani is also a beneficiary of a cool breeze that often blows off the [[Congo River]].<ref>(Source: City of Kisangani, in December 2008)</ref>

===Architecture===

The character of Kisangani's urban residential districts is often defined by the elegant villas with tiled roofs of old Belgian influence, [[brownstone]] [[rowhouses]], [[townhouses]], and [[tenements]] that were built during a period of rapid expansion from 1908 to 1950. Large swaths of Kisangani's rural residential areas away from the city centre are characterized by continual strings of villages unfolding, each composed of thatched roof tops built from the early 20th century through to the present day. At times the path is filled with a sweet [[floral]] fragrance and clouded with white and purple butterflies. Forests give way to patches of [[grassland]], then clumps of [[bamboo]] and then more forest.

===Communes===
[[File:ImageKisMotumbe.jpg|thumb|Houses in Motumbé district, Kisangani.]]

Many parents believe that part-time work helps children to become more independent as well as providing them (and sometimes their families) with some extra income.<ref>[http://www.congoblog.net/vive-les-vacances-vive-le-travail-des-enfants/]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091207215232/http://www.congoblog.net/vive-les-vacances-vive-le-travail-des-enfants/|date=7 December 2009}}</ref>

==Demographics==
During its first century, Kisangani grew at a rate that ranked among the fastest growing in the [[Belgian Congo]]. Within the span of forty years, the city's population grew from slightly under 15,018 to over 121,765 by 1958. By the close of the 20th century, Kisangani was the third largest city in [[Zaire]], and the largest of the cities that existed in the former Orientale province. Within thirty-three years of Zairieanastion, the population had tripled to over 600,000, and reached its highest ever-recorded population of 672,739 for the 2003 census.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanleyville.be/geographie.html |title=Géographie |publisher=Stanleyville.be |access-date=2015-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126105839/http://www.stanleyville.be/geographie.html |archive-date=26 January 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The population is ethnically diverse and is changing rapidly, especially in large cities such as Kisangani, so it is not always easy to get an exact picture of the ethnic origin of all the population from census statistics.

Kisangani is the most populous city of the Northern provinces in the DRC, with an estimated 2008 population of 1,200,000 (up from 406,249 thousand in 1993). This amounts to about more than half the population of the northern regional population lives in the province of [[Tshopo]]. Over the last decade the city's population has been increasing.<ref>Population of major cities DRC Wikipedia(2008)</ref>

===Historical populations===
In 1905, there were a total of eleven stations and stations of the state in the area of [[Boyoma Falls|Stanley Falls]] and Stanleyville. The total number of state officials increased to 40.<ref>(Source "Notice sur l'état indépendant du Congo", Bruxelles, imprimerie Monom, 1905) (Source "record on the independent state of Congo, Brussels", printing Monom, 1905)</ref>

In 1909, the European Stanleyville numbered 80 and the native population was estimated at 15,000 people within a radius of 5 kilometers.<ref>(Source "Le Congo, les Noirs et Nous", Fritz Van der Linden, Ed. A. Challamel, 1910 (Source "The Congo, blacks and Us", Fritz Van der Linden, Ed A. Challamel, 1910
Quelques extraits du livre, compilés par Pierre VAN BOST, qui décrivent la station à l'époque) Some excerpts from the book, compiled by Peter VAN BOST, describing the station at the time)</ref>

At the time the sprawling population in 1918 required the District Commissioner to create a daily food market in Kisangani, near the Hospital Avenue, 1 kilometre from shore. Two more weekly markets were also created on the other side, one near the docks and another at CFL Mission St. Gabriel. The population in the 1920s increased to 4,000 [[Ethnic groups of Africa|Africans]] and 200 Europeans, with an average of 2000 inhabitants moving around downtown Stanleyville (in the chiefdom Arabized).

The population of Stanleyville, in the early 1950s stood at 40,000 and by the late 1950s the population reached 70,000.<ref>(Source : CEDAF (Centre d'étude et de documentation africaines) – Cahier 5 Série 2  – Histoire – 1978  –  "Histoire économique d'une ville coloniale : Kisangani 1877 – 1960" par Bogumil JEWSIECKI).

===Ethnicities===

The population of Kisangani is exceptionally diverse. Throughout its history the city has been a major melting pot of entry for immigrants. Today, some of the city's population has foreign ancestry and among Congolese cities, this proportion is exceeded only by [[Kinshasa]] and [[Lubumbashi]]. In Kisangani no single community or region of origin dominates.

Some of the many African ethnic groups in Kisangani are: Bamanga, Popoi, [[Boa people|Boa]], [[Lokele]], Turumbu, [[Mbole people|Mbole]], Kumu, Wagenia, Rega, [[Topoke people|Topoke]], [[Lokele people|Lokele]], [[Turumbu people|Turumbu]], Basoko, Lendu, [[Budu people|Budu]], Bangetu, [[Logo people|Logo]], [[Alur people|Alur]], [[Hema people|Hema]], [[Azande people|Azande]] and Yira ethnic group also have a notable presence.<ref name="unblog1"/> Non-African ethnic groups include many [[Flemish people|Flemings]] of Belgian origin. There are also small groups of [[Greeks]], Chinese, [[Walloons]], [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indians]] and, lately, [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]].<ref name="nytimes1997"/>

The city has a heterogeneous population of over 250 ethnic African majorities of which Wagenia and Kumu compose the native population:

*[[File:Activités culturelles 3.jpg|thumb|222x222px|Cultural activities in Kisangani showcase local traditions and community celebrations]]In the north of the city of the Tshopo Commune, reside the Bamanga, Popoi, [[Boa people|Boa]] that emigrated all the way from [[Buta, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Buta]].
* To the south of the city live the population groups of the Lokele, Turumbu, Mbole, Kumu, Wagenia and Rega, in the Lubunga Commune. Some arrived from the province of [[Maniema]] by the way of [[Ubundu]] road and rail, as well as the Opala road and the river toward the neighbouring territory of [[Isangi territory|Isangi]].
*Towards the west in the Commune of Mangobo, lie the Topoke, Lokele, Turumbu and Basoko, whom emigrated through the [[Congo River]] and Tshopo River, which divides the city into two banks of Tshopo.
*To the east of the city in the commune of [[Kabondo, Kisangani|Kabondo]], is home to the Lendu, Budu, Bangetu, Logo, [[Alur people|Alur]], Hema, Nande, Yira, whom arrived Kisangani the Ituri road in [[Bunia]].

===Language===
[[French language|French]] is the official language of the DR Congo (DRC) and widely used and understood.<ref name="societecivile1"/> Common local languages in Kisangani include [[Lingala language|Lingala]], [[Zande language|Pa-Zande]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]].

During independence of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the city was the political central base of the [[Mouvement National Congolais]] (MNC). Patrice Lumumba's strong ties with the city had been forged during his days as one of 350 clerks at the central post office. Kisangani is now home to influential political youth groups such as Bana Etats-Unis and [[Vendome]].
[[File:La mairie de Kisangani 2.jpg|thumb|247x247px|The Kisangani Town Hall (popularly known as the "Maison Blanche") in the [[Makiso|Makiso commune]]]]
Since its devolution in 2006, Kisangani has been the Capital of [[Tshopo]] with a "strong" mayor-council form of government. Decentralization of central government power was enabled to give provincial governments more control of matters that directly affect them. The government of Kisangani is more centralized than that of most other DRC cities. As a constitutional democracy, Kisangani is governed by a wide range of institutions: the [[judiciary]], the police, the civil service and the institutions of local government. In Kisangani, the central government is responsible for [[public education]], [[correctional institutions]], [[libraries]], [[public safety]], recreational facilities, [[sanitation]], [[water supply]] and [[welfare]] services.

The [[People's Party for Reconstruction and Democracy]] (PPRD) holds the majority of public offices. As of November 2006, most of registered voters in the city are PPRD. Kisangani is the capital of the [[Tshopo Province]]. Kisangani was given the official nickname "City of Hope" by its government. Kisangani, a city home to some 1,200,000 civilians, is administratively divided into six urban communes: Makiso, [[Tshopo]], Mangobo, [[Kabondo, Kisangani|Kabondo]], Kisangani, and Lubunga and the communities of [[Lubuya]] and Bera are also parts of Kisangani City. Each commune is home to dozens of smaller neighborhoods (known in French as quartiers).<ref name="unblog2">{{cite web |url=http://hoteldevillekisangani.unblog.fr/le-maire/portrait-du-maire/ |title=Biographie du Maire · Site officiel de l'Hôtel de Ville de Kisangani |publisher=Hoteldevillekisangani.unblog.fr |date=2010-01-22 |access-date=2015-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901053200/http://hoteldevillekisangani.unblog.fr/le-maire/portrait-du-maire/ |archive-date=1 September 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The head of the city government in Kisangani is the mayor, who is first among equals in the city council. The mayor in the period of 2008–2009 was Guy Shilton Baendo.<ref name="unblog2"/> The city council is a democratically elected institution and is the final decision-making authority in the city, although much power is centralized in the executive committee. The council has jurisdiction over many matters, including public security, agreements with other governments, subsidy programs, the environment, urban planning, and a three-year capital expenditure program. The city council is also required to supervise, standardize or approve certain decisions made by the commune councils.

Reporting directly to the City Council, the executive committee exercises decision-making powers similar to that of the cabinet in a parliamentary system and is responsible for preparing various documents including budgets and [[by-laws]], submitted to the [[City Council]] for approval. The decision-making powers of the executive committee cover, in particular, the awarding of contracts or grants, the management of human and financial resources, supplies and buildings. It may also be assigned further powers by the City Council.<ref name="unblog2"/>

===Administration history===
During much of the last half of the 20th century, Kisangani's politics were dominated by a growing [[Mouvement National Congolais]] (MNC) organization dominated by the charismatic [[Patrice Lumumba]]. During 1964 Kisangani was under siege of the Simbas, a group of powerful radical tradition with large and highly organized socialist, anarchist and labor organizations.<ref name="societecivile1"/>

Indeed, a decree of Governor General dated 6 September 1958 and entered into force on 1 January 1959 established the city of Stanleyville. The city was divided into communes; each headed by a Mayor, the chief head of all of Stanleyville City was the city's first Mayor.<ref name="autogenerated2007">Sources : Wikipedia 2007, Monuc 2006 et Guy De Boeck</ref>

The first consultation was held in commune of Stanleyville on Sunday, 14 December 1958. By Order No. 12/35 of 6 September 1958, the territory of Stanleyville took the status of a city. Stanleyville was divided into 4 municipalities: Belgian I, Belgian II, Brussels and Stanley.<ref name="unblog4">[http://tresorkh.unblog.fr/2008/08/06/kisangani-ma-ville/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091227060836/http://tresorkh.unblog.fr/2008/08/06/kisangani-ma-ville/|date=27 December 2009}}</ref>

Stanleyville's City Council assisted each mayor in running the whole city, whilst each of the municipalities was assisted by Municipal Councils. The mayors of municipalities and municipal council members were elected. The city council included members of law, the mayors of municipalities, members appointed has company representatives, middle class representative and members representing the municipal councils.<ref name="autogenerated2007"/>

===Laws===
Kisangani and its administrative representatives formed a prominent group responsible for drafting of the Congolese Forestry Code. The new forestry code according to section 89 requires logging companies, to draw up social responsibility contracts with their concessions, which may include building schools, housing and clinics while they carry out logging operations. Essentially the law demands firms to set up company towns. [[Greenpeace]] has however attacked this corporate-centered model, because it undermines the state's responsibility to create a functioning system of social services.<ref>{{cite journal | url=https://www.thenation.com/article/fight-save-congos-forests/ | title=The Fight to Save Congo's Forests | first=Christian | last=Parenti | date=4 October 2007 | journal=The Nation | access-date=14 April 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730063106/https://www.thenation.com/article/fight-save-congos-forests/ | archive-date=30 July 2017 | url-status=live }}</ref>

The law states that the schooling age is from 5 to 19 years old, which comprises 39% of Kisangani's population. The working age begins at 20 years and retirement age is set at 69 years old of which is 41.42% of the city's demography.<ref name="unblog4"/>

==Education==
Since the 1950s, Kisangani has been a Congolese center of higher education and research with several universities that are in the city proper or in the immediate environs. Kisangani has the third largest campus of the National University of Congo. Much of the scientific research in the city is done in medicine and the life sciences. The Medicine Faculty at the Université de Kisangani was made infamous by Polio Vaccine conspiracy theorists.

In 2007, there were 381 academic and research staff, most of them (215) active in the humanities and social sciences – but the recent history of the institution overshadows its current realities.

Currently, the university's income is derived from student fees (49 percent) and government subsidies (51 percent), but university management reports that the current income level is insufficient for effective operation. In addition, there is a serious need for infrastructure rehabilitation and additions, as well as for the acquisition of research literature. Although the university does not have a strategic plan to develop additional income sources, it is taking steps to increase academic fees to improve the daily operation of the institution.

The main challenges facing the university include serious weaknesses in the university's [[information and communication technology]] (ICT) capabilities; and then the lack of qualified staff, of financial means, of premises and equipment, and of literature and laboratories. Clearly, the university's physical infrastructure has not been rebuilt since the troubles. This is one reason why only 20% of the institutional focus of the [[Université de Kisangani]] is reckoned for research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sarua.org/?q=uni_Universit%C3%A9%20de%20Kisangani |title=Université de Kisangani |publisher=SARUA |date=2000-06-16 |access-date=2015-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728002241/http://www.sarua.org/?q=uni_Universit%C3%A9%20de%20Kisangani |archive-date=28 July 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Kisangani is the seat of the [[Université de Kisangani]] (1963), Université Mariste du Congo, Institut Superieur du Commerce (ISC), Institut Superieur Pedagogique and Institut de Batiment et de Travaux Publiques, and the Kisangani [[Culture of Greece|Hellenic]] Center. The Kisangani Public Library, which has the largest collection of any public library system in the Kisangani, serves Makiso, [[Tshopo]], Mangobo, [[Kabondo, Kisangani|Kabondo]], Kisangani, Lubunga, [[Lubuya]] and Bera. The city's public school system is managed by the Kisangani Department of Education.  The primary and secondary schools are public and privately run by secular and religious groups in the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanleyville.be/enseignement.html |title=Enseignement |publisher=Stanleyville.be |access-date=2015-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090607043619/http://www.stanleyville.be/enseignement.html |archive-date=7 June 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Kisangani grew in importance as a trading port while under Belgian rule. After the upper [[Congo basin]] wars of Euro-Arab in the 1880s the city became the Belgian military and political base of operations in Northern Congo. In the mid-20th century, the city was transformed by immigration and development. A visionary development proposal expanded the city street grid to encompass all of Boyoma, and the 1819 opening of a railroad built to bypass the cataracts on the [[Congo River]], opened shipping routes further into the Congo jungle. Kisangani became the most populous urbanized area and the undisputed economic and cultural centre of Northern Congo.<ref name="unblog1"/>

===Transport===
The transportation system in Kisangani is extensive and complex. It includes the longest suspension bridge in Northern Congo.<ref>Tshopo Bridge</ref> Public local transport is served by a network of buses, commuter trains and waterways that extend across and off the island.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Lambertz |first1=Peter |last2=Liagologa |first2=Victor Yaaya |title=Les "transportants" de Kisangani: bus Indiens, moteurs Chinois et biographies socio-techniques (Kisangani, RDC) |trans-title=The "transporters" of Kisangani: Indian buses, Chinese engines and socio-technical biographies (Kisangani, DRC) |url=https://apad-association.org/conf-summary/les-transportants-de-kisangani-bus-indiens-moteurs-chinois-et-biographies-socio-techniques-kisangani-rdc/?lang=en |access-date=5 November 2024 |website=APAD |language=en-US |publication-place=Paris, France}}</ref>
[[File:La cour de RVA Kisangani.jpg|thumb|244x244px|The RVA Kisangani courtyard within the Bangoka Airport concession]]
Unlike many major cities, Kisangani does not have a problem with vehicular traffic congestion. Kisangani's high rate of public transit use, daily Toleka users and many pedestrian commuters makes it the most energy-efficient major city in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC). Walk and tolek modes of travel account for high percentage of all modes for trips in the city. The Tolek is a cycling taxi ("Toleka" means "Time" in [[Lingala]]), that emerged as the primary means of transportation around Kisangani during the mid-1990s.<ref>Sources : Wikipedia 2007 / Jean Flouriot "Introduction à la géographique physique et humaine du Zaïre" 1994 / Mairie de Kisangani 2008) (Sources: Wikipedia, 2007 / Jean Flouriot "Introduction to physical geography and human Zaire" 1994 / City of Kisangani in 2008)</ref>

As the city lies between stretches of the Tshopo and Congo Rivers, many tributaries and islands are intertwined conducive to moving inland waterways for the population of Kisangani and the transportation of goods by ships, boats or canoe (paddle or motorized), from one bank to another and from one neighborhood to another is made possible. Waterway systems connect Kisangani to various locales within and outside the city (including [[Isangi]] and Lomami). Kisangani is the highest navigable point on the [[River Congo]] and the terminus of river traffic from Kinshasa and all ports operated by [[Office National des Transports (Congo)|ONATRA]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stanleyville.be/fleuve.html |title=Le fleuve |publisher=Stanleyville.be |access-date=2015-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100318000239/http://www.stanleyville.be/fleuve.html |archive-date=18 March 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[File:Route de kisangani.jpg|left|thumb|217x217px|A scenic road in Kisangani, lined with lush greenery]]
A considerable amount of automobile taxis and buses are also employed to supporting public transit throughout the city. The building of new gas stations and rehabilitation efforts for redevelopment of urban roads and the opening of the No. 4 National Highway Road are among the main factors behind this resumption of automobiles. The redevelopment of the National Highway Road No.4 has meant an increase in scrambling shuttles of traffic between Kisangani, [[Bafwasende]], [[Komanda]], Nurse, [[Mambasa]], [[Beni, Nord-Kivu|Beni]] and [[Butembo]]. Kisangani provides connections to [[Ubundu]] and Opala, along the southern corridors of [[Ubundu]] and Opala road respectively as well as long-distance road networks to cities such as Lubutu, [[Walikale]], [[Goma]] and [[Kigali]] (in [[Rwanda]]) by way of the National Highway Road No. 2.<ref name="congoblog.net" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/dr-congo-national-road-no-2 |title=DR Congo National Road No. 2: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |access-date=2015-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108092229/http://www.answers.com/topic/dr-congo-national-road-no-2 |archive-date=8 November 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> Kisangani is part of the [[Trans-African Highway network]] 8 (TAH 8), at a length of 6259&nbsp;km, the [[Trans-African Highway]] between [[Lagos]] (Nigeria) – [[Mombasa]] (Kenya) is longest transcontinental route between east–west of Africa. Kisangani also has access to the Indian Ocean coast by way of a highway corridor connecting the city to [[Dar es Salaam]] (Tanzania).<ref>[http://www.miningcongo.cd/cartes_corridor.htm%20]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723033908/http://www.miningcongo.cd/cartes_corridor.htm%20|date=23 July 2011}}</ref>

Shipping beyond Kisangani is impossible due to the [[Boyoma Falls]]; a [[portage railway]] was therefore built to [[Ubundu]]. It is operated by [[Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer du Congo]], starting from Kisangani Station.<ref name="unblog4"/> This is considered the first section of the [[Rail transport in the Democratic Republic of the Congo#Routes|Great Lakes line]].

Kisangani is served by [[Kisangani Bangoka International Airport]] on the far east side and the older [[Simi-Simi Airport]] on the west side. Bangoka is for commercial passenger flights and cargo only, whereas Simi-Simi mainly serves military purposes, though it also hosts some private and humanitarian flights.<ref name="unblog4"/>

=== Future and proposed projects ===

==== Rail ====
In October 2007, a railway was proposed to connect Kisangani to Kasese in western Uganda. This railway would extend as {{railgauge|1435 mm}} gauge to the Kenyan port of [[Lamu]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Guia |first=Lucien Epimi |date=2024 |title=Évaluation du processus d'intégration régionale au sein de la CEPGL: réflexion à partir de la coopération sectorielle dans le domaine économique |trans-title=Evaluation of the regional integration process within the CEPGL: reflection based on sectoral cooperation in the economic field |url=https://edition-efua.acaref.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2024/01/Lucien-Epimi-Guia.pdf |access-date=5 November 2024 |website=Edition-efua.acaref.net |page=16 (323) |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Ubwani |first=Zephania |date=3 October 2007 |title=Uganda: Country to Get 4 New Railway Lines |url=https://allafrica.com/stories/200710021189.html |access-date=5 November 2007 |website=[[Daily Monitor]] |publication-place=Kampala, Uganda}}</ref>

==== Road ====
The transcontinental road projects in Africa, [[Trans-African Highway]] network encompass Kisangani through the [[Lagos-Mombasa Highway]].

Following the mandate of "5 Chantiers" the city of Kisangani road network undergoing redevelopment to make the city more integrated with towns and cities of other provinces, especially the eastern regions that previously made up the former Orientale Province. Boulevards in and around downtown Kisangani are part of the project.<ref>(Sources : Wikipedia 2007 / Jean Flouriot "Introduction à la géographique physique et humaine du Zaïre" 1994 / Mairie de Kisangani 2008) (Sources: Wikipedia, 2007 / Jean Flouriot "Introduction to physical geography and human Zaire" 1994 / City of Kisangani in 2008)</ref>
