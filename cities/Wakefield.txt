'''Wakefield''' is a [[City status in the United Kingdom|cathedral city]]{{efn|The area that is the subject of this article does not have legal city status of itself, but is widely regarded as a city since it is the main and nominate settlement in the City of Wakefield local government area{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}}} in [[West Yorkshire]], England located on the [[River Calder, West Yorkshire|River Calder]]. The city had a population of 109,766 in the [[2021 United Kingdom census|2021 census]], up from 99,251 in the [[2011 Census for England and Wales|2011 census]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/yorkshireandthehumber/ |title=Wakefield |publisher=citypopulation.de |access-date=11 February 2023 |archive-date=24 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230224013655/https://citypopulation.de/en/uk/yorkshireandthehumber/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The city is the administrative centre of the wider [[Metropolitan Borough of Wakefield]], which had a {{United Kingdom statistics year|England}} population of {{English district population|GSS=E08000036}}, the [[List of English districts by population|{{English district rank|GSS=E08000036}}]] most populous district in England. It is part of the [[West Yorkshire Built-up Area]] and the [[Yorkshire and The Humber]] region.

In 1888, it gained city status due to [[Wakefield Cathedral|its cathedral]]. The city has a [[Wakefield Town Hall|town hall]] and is home to the [[Wakefield County Hall|county hall]], which was the former administrative centre of the city's [[county borough]] and [[metropolitan borough]] as well as [[county town]] for the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]].

The [[Battle of Wakefield]] took place in the [[Wars of the Roses]], and the city was a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] stronghold in the [[English Civil War|Civil War]]. Wakefield became an important [[market town]] and centre for wool, exploiting its position on the navigable River Calder to become an [[inland port]]. In the 18th&nbsp;century, Wakefield traded in corn, coal and textiles.

==History==
===Toponymy===
The name ''Wakefield'' may derive from "Waca's field" â€“ the open land belonging to someone named "Waca" or could have evolved from the [[Old English]] word ''wacu'', meaning "a watch or wake", and ''feld'', an open field in which a wake or festival was held.<ref>{{Harvnb|Reaney|1964|p=161}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Mills|1998|p=361}}</ref> In the [[Domesday Book]] of 1086, it was written ''Wachefeld'' and also as ''Wachefelt''.

===Early history===

During the [[Wars of the Roses]], [[Richard of York, 3rd Duke of York|Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York]] was killed on 30 December 1460 in the [[Battle of Wakefield]] near Sandal Castle. In [[medieval]] times Wakefield became an inland port on the Calder and centre for the woollen and [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] trades. In 1538 [[John Leland (antiquary)|John Leland]] described Wakefield as, "a very quick market-towne and meately large; well served of flesch and fisch, both from the se and by rivers, whereof divers be thereabout at hande, so that al vitaile is very gode chepe there. A right honest man shal fare well for two pens a meale". As preparation for the impending invasion by the [[Spanish Armada]] in April 1588, 400 men from the wapentake of Morley and Agbrigg were summoned to Bruntcliffe near [[Morley, West Yorkshire|Morley]] with their weapons. Men from Kirkgate, Westgate, Northgate and Sandal were amongst them and all returned by August.<ref>{{Harvnb|Walker|1966|p=414}}</ref>

At the time of the Civil War, Wakefield was a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] stronghold. An attack led by Sir [[Thomas Fairfax]] on 20 May 1643 captured the town for the [[Roundhead|Parliamentarians]].

===Industrial Revolution===
[[File:Wakefield Westgate.jpg|thumb|right|Wakefield Westgate {{circa|1900}}]]
At the start of the 19th&nbsp;century Wakefield was a wealthy market town and inland port trading in wool and grain.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|2008|p=7}}</ref> The [[Aire and Calder Navigation|Aire and Calder]] and [[Calder and Hebble Navigation]]s and the [[Barnsley Canal]] were instrumental in the development of Wakefield as an important market for grain and more was sold here than at any other market in the north. Large warehouses were built on the river banks to store grain from [[Norfolk]], [[Cambridgeshire]] and [[Lincolnshire]] to supply the fast-growing population in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. Great quantities of barley were grown in the neighbourhood and in 1885 more [[malt]] was made in Wakefield "than in any district of equal extent in the kingdom".<ref name="TDE">{{citation |last=Lewis |first=Samuel |title=Wakefield (All Saints) |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51368#s5 |work=A Topographical Dictionary of England |publisher=British History Online |pages=432â€“436 |year=1848 |access-date=14 December 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017051015/http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=51368#s5 |archive-date=17 October 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> The market developed in the streets around the Bull Ring, and the cattle market between George Street and Ings Road grew to be one of the biggest in the country.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|2008|p=89}}</ref> Road transport using [[Turnpike trust|turnpiked]] roads was important.

Up to 1837 Wakefield relied on wells and springs for its water supply; water from the River Calder was polluted, and various water supply schemes were unsuccessful until [[reservoir]]s on the Rishworth Moors and a service reservoir at Ardsley were built providing clean water from 1888.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|2008|p=60}}</ref>

The glass and textile industries closed in the 1970s and 1980s, and coal faced competition from alternative sources and demand decreased. The coal mines around Wakefield were amongst the first in Yorkshire to close under the government of [[Margaret Thatcher]], which altered the national energy policy from a reliance on British coal and opposed the political power of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|NUM]]. Between 1979 and 1983, the pits at Lofthouse, Manor, Newmarket, Newmillerdam, Parkhill and Walton all closed.<ref>Colin Jackson, ''The Complete A-Z of Colliery Names, Pre-1947 Owners, Areas & Dates, Volume 2'', published by the National Coal Mining Museum for England, 2002</ref> As the Wakefield pits closed, the [[Selby Coalfield]] was being opened, many colliers in Wakefield accepted offers to transfer to the new pits which were built to facilitate commuting.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Adeney |first1=Martin |last2=Lloyd |first2=John |date=1988 |title=The Miners' Strike 1984-5: Loss Without Limit |location=London |publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul |page=26 |isbn=0-7102-1371-9}}</ref>

Wakefield was anciently a market and parish town in the Agbrigg division of the [[wapentake]] of [[Agbrigg and Morley]] in the [[West Riding of Yorkshire]]. It became a parliamentary borough with one Member of Parliament after the [[Reform Act 1832]]. In 1836 the Wakefield [[poor law union|Poor Law Union]] was formed following the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]] 1834 with an elected board of guardians.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|2008|p=23 }}</ref> The town was incorporated as a [[municipal borough]] with elected councillors in 1848 under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835.<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|2008|p=25 }}</ref>

Wakefield was the ''de facto'' seat of regional government in Yorkshire for two centuries and became the county headquarters of the West Riding County Council created by the [[Local Government Act 1888]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Taylor|2008|p=41 }}</ref> After Wakefield was elevated to a diocese in 1888, Wakefield council sought city status which was granted the same year.<ref>{{Harvnb|Beckett|2005|pp=39,40 }}</ref> Wakefield became a [[county borough]] in 1913.<ref>{{Harvnb|Freeman|1966|p=173 }}</ref> In 1974, under the terms of the [[Local Government Act 1972]], the county borough became defunct as it merged with surrounding local authorities to become the [[City of Wakefield]] district.

The economy of Wakefield declined in the last quarter of the 20th&nbsp;century as the coal mines and traditional manufacturing industries closed, contributing to high rates of unemployment. In the [[Index of Multiple Deprivation]] 2015, 14.35% of the district's lower super-output areas were in the most deprived 10% of England.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/464464/File_10_ID2015_Local_Authority_District_Summaries.xlsx |title=Index of Multiple Deprivation 2015 â€“ File 10 â€“ local authority summaries |access-date=19 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007214738/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/464464/File_10_ID2015_Local_Authority_District_Summaries.xlsx |archive-date=7 October 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Employment grew by 12% between 1998 and 2003 as the economy recovered and enjoyed growth as the economic base of the district was diversified. Growth has been supported by inward investment from European and United Kingdom government funding which has impacted on the regeneration of the area. Manufacturing remains an important employment sector although the decline is projected to continue whilst distribution and the service industries are now among the main employers.<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.wakefield.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/AF5093EE-1B21-44F4-AE8E-889C2BBC5236/0/WakefieldInDepth2005.pdf |title=Wakefield in Depth 2005 |page=12 |last=Hunter |first=Phillip |year=2005 |publisher=Learning and Skills Council West Yorkshire |access-date=17 November 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615130006/http://www.wakefield.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/AF5093EE-1B21-44F4-AE8E-889C2BBC5236/0/WakefieldInDepth2005.pdf |archive-date=15 June 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>
