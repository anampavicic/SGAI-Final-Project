'''Vĩnh Long''' is a [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] located in the [[Mekong Delta]] of southwestern [[Vietnam]]. Its capital is [[Vĩnh Long]]. Its population is 1,046,390 and its area is {{Convert|1525.73|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}.<ref name="area_2022"/> Vĩnh Long (spelled 永隆 in the former [[Hán-Nôm]] writing system) is a [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]] name, translating as "eternal prosperity."

==Administrative history==
[[File:Bản vẽ thành Vĩnh Long.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Vĩnh Long citadel in the Nguyễn dynasty]]
Modern-day Vĩnh Long was part of Long Hồ ''dinh'' (barrack, 營) established by the [[Nguyễn lords]] in 1732, comprising the provinces of [[Bến Tre province|Bến Tre]], [[Trà Vinh province|Trà Vinh]], and parts of [[Cần Thơ province|Cần Thơ]].

The area saw some of the heaviest fighting between the [[Tây Sơn]] brothers and the Nguyễn lords in the late 18th century; in 1784 [[Nguyễn Huệ]] defeated Siamese forces aiding [[Nguyễn Ánh]] at the Mang Thít River.

In 1951, the Southern Resistance Administrative Committee of the [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] merged Vĩnh Long and Trà Vinh provinces into [[Vĩnh Trà province]]. Vinh Tra existed until 1954 (however, as North Vietnam never administered the area for a significant period of time, this arrangement was not enforced). In 1957, the [[South Vietnam]] formed Vĩnh Long province, consisting of six districts: Châu Thành, Chợ Lách (now part of [[Bến Tre province]]), Tam Bình, Bình Minh, Sa Đéc, and  Lấp Vò. In 1961, [[Cái Nhum District]] was split from Chợ Lách. [[Châu Thành District, Đồng Tháp Province|Đức Tôn District]] and [[Đức Thành District]] were added in 1962, but joined the newly formed [[Sa Đéc province]] in 1966.  As of 1975, the province had seven districts: Châu Thành, Chợ Lách, Tam Bình, Bình Minh, Minh Đức, Trà Ôn, and Vũng Liêm.

After the [[fall of Saigon|fall of South Vietnam]], the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] merged Vĩnh Long with [[Trà Vinh province]], forming [[Cửu Long province]] in 1976. In 1991, Cửu Long was again split into Vĩnh Long and Trà Vinh. At the time of the split,  Vĩnh Long province consisted of one city ([[Vĩnh Long]]) and five districts: Long Hồ, Vũng Liêm, Bình Minh, Tam Bình, and Trà Ôn.

In 1992, Mang Thít District was re-split from Long Hồ District. In 2007, Bình Tân District was created.

On April 10, 2009, the [[Vietnamese Government]] issued Decree No. 16/ND-CP establishing [[Vĩnh Long|Vĩnh Long City]] in Vĩnh Long Province, based on the entire natural area and population of Vĩnh Long Town.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Thành lập thành phố Vĩnh Long |url=https://baocantho.com.vn/thanh-lap-thanh-pho-vinh-long-a43870.html |access-date=2024-11-05 |website=baocantho.com.vn |language=vi}}</ref>

==Geography==
Lying between the [[Bassac River|Hau]] and Tien rivers in the center of the [[Mekong Delta]], Vĩnh Long is a province well known for fishing.

===Administrative divisions===
Vĩnh Long is subdivided into eight district-level sub-divisions:

* 6 districts:
{{div col}}
** [[Bình Tân District, Vĩnh Long|Bình Tân]]
** [[Long Hồ District|Long Hồ]]
** [[Mang Thít District|Mang Thít]]
** [[Tam Bình District|Tam Bình]]
** [[Trà Ôn District|Trà Ôn]]
** [[Vũng Liêm District|Vũng Liêm]]
{{div col end}}
* 1 district-level town:
** [[Bình Minh]]
* 1 provincial city:
** [[Vĩnh Long]] (capital)

They are further subdivided into five commune-level towns (or townlets), 94 communes, and 10 wards.

==Economy==

[[Prawn]]s and the [[Basa fish|Basa]] and Tra [[catfish]] are among the many types of fish that exist in abundance in the waters of Vĩnh Long. Its rich, fertile soil makes Vĩnh Long an ideal location for the growing of many exotic and delicious fruits, including the strange-looking [[mangosteen]], the spikey [[rambutan]] and the pungently fragrant [[durian]]. Because of Vĩnh Long's extensive network of waterways, these fruits and many other items can be purchased for mere [[penny|pennies]] from the huge water-based squadron of floating merchants.

Traveling by water is a common practice here for such mundane tasks as grocery shopping as well as getting to restaurants and tourist attractions located on small islets accessible only by boat. Tourist infrastructure is still in its infancy here, but comfortable lodging and great food can be had for very reasonable prices.

==Transportation==

Located approximately {{convert|135|km}} southwest of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Hồ Chí Minh City]], Vĩnh Long is easily accessible by bus, van or car using [[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|National Route 1]] and the [[Mỹ Thuận Bridge]].
