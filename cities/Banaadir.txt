The territorial extent and scope of the term ''Benaadir'' has varied in definition throughout its history, with medieval usage extending Benaadir to huge swaths of coast adjacent to Mogadishu stretching as far as hundreds of miles, from [[Hobyo]] in the north. The early modern period which extended the meaning of ''Benaadir'' to the interior midway towards the [[Hirshabelle]] region, to the contemporary period wherein sometimes the nonstandard misnomer of usage being interchangeable with the city of Mogadishu. This Banaadir municipality is bordered to the north by [[Hirshabelle]] and to the southwest by [[South West State of Somalia|South West]], and is the only Somali ''gobol'' (administrative region) which is both a municipality and a ''gobol'' known as a region.

==Overview==

The Banaadir region is bordered by the [[Middle Shebelle]] (Shabeellaha Dhexe) and [[Lower Shebelle]] (Shabeellaha Hoose), as well as the Indian Ocean.

"Benaadir" is derived from the [[Somali language|Somali]] ''banaadir'', which means "coast", in reference to the southern Somali coastal cities [[Mogadishu]], [[Merka]] and [[Barawa]]. The place name reflects the region's medieval position as a key trade center with [[Persia]], [[Arabian Peninsula]] and the Swahili coast.<ref name="Aths">{{cite book|last1=Njoku|first1=Raphael Chijioke|title=The History of Somalia|date=2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0313378577|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FlL2vE_qRQ8C|access-date=14 September 2014|archive-date=18 May 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240518175752/https://books.google.com/books?id=FlL2vE_qRQ8C|url-status=live}}</ref>

The name derives from the [[Persian language|Persian]] [[Bandar (port)|bandar]] (بندر) meaning ‘port’ or ‘harbour’.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Everett-Heath |first=John |url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191882913.001.0001/acref-9780191882913;jsessionid=21AB7474EB0B7530E98406BEF99B2D9D |title=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Place Names |date=2019-10-24 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-188291-3 |language=en-US |doi=10.1093/acref/9780191882913.001.0001 |access-date=15 March 2023 |archive-date=22 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240522133514/https://www.oxfordreference.com/display/10.1093/acref/9780191882913.001.0001/acref-9780191882913;jsessionid=21AB7474EB0B7530E98406BEF99B2D9D |url-status=live }}</ref>

Its capital is Mogadishu, known locally as Xamar (pronounced: Hamar), although the administrative region itself is coextensive with the city. Benaadir is much smaller than the historical region of Benadir, which covered most of the country's central and southern seaboard opposite the [[Indian Ocean]] and up to the [[Juba River]], including Mogadishu.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XCKiAJnmolAC&dq=benadiri+kismayo&pg=PA202 |title=Le missioni cattoliche rivista quindicinale |date=1891 |language=it}}</ref>

Thabit M. Abdi was appointed mayor of Mogadishu and governor of Banaadir in 2017, succeeding Yusuf Hussein Jimale who held that post since November 2015.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.hiiraan.com/news4/2017/Apr/141440/thabit_abdi_named_as_the_new_mayor_of_mogadishu.aspx | title=Thabit Abdi named as the new Mayor of Mogadishu | date=6 April 2017 | publisher=Hiiraan Online | access-date=11 July 2019 | archive-date=25 July 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190725132913/https://www.hiiraan.com/news4/2017/apr/141440/thabit_abdi_named_as_the_new_mayor_of_mogadishu.aspx | url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==
===Political===
Tradition and old records assert that southern Somalia, including the Mogadishu area, was inhabited by [[Benadiri people|Benadiris]] for centuries<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lewis |first=I. M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eK6SBJIckIsC&q=Oman+suzerainty+mogadishu&pg=PA18 |title=A Pastoral Democracy: A Study of Pastoralism and Politics Among the Northern Somali of the Horn of Africa |date=1999 |publisher=James Currey Publishers |isbn=978-0-85255-280-3 |language=en |access-date=2020-11-06 |archive-date=2022-03-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220329041023/https://books.google.com/books?id=eK6SBJIckIsC&q=Oman+suzerainty+mogadishu&pg=PA18 |url-status=live }}</ref> and was during the [[early modern period]] considered the wealthiest city on the [[East Africa]]n coast, as well as the center of a thriving [[textile]] industry.<ref>Horn and Crescent Cultural Change and Traditional Islam on the East African Coast, by Randall L. Pouwels – Notes to Pages 37–40</ref> In the 17th century, Mogadishu and parts of southern Somalia fell under the [[Hiraab Imamate]] and in the 19th century came under the [[Geledi Sultanate]]'s sphere of influence.

After the Somali Republic became independent in 1960, Mogadishu became known and promoted as the ''White Pearl of the Indian Ocean''. After the ousting of the [[Siad Barre]] regime in 1991 and the ensuing [[Somali Civil War]], various militias fought for control of the city, later to be replaced by the [[Islamic Courts Union]] in the mid-2000s. The ICU thereafter splintered into more radical groups, notably the [[al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]], which fought the [[Transitional Federal Government]] (2004–2012) and its [[African Union Mission to Somalia]] allies. With a change in administration in late 2010, government troops and their military partners had succeeded in forcing out Al-Shabaab by August 2011. Mogadishu has then subsequently experienced a period of intense reconstruction.

==Population==

The 1,650,227 (as of 2014) residents of Benaadir are 50.7% female and come from 303,021 households.<ref name="PESS" /> It has the highest percentage of residents who are internally displaced persons among the regions of Somalia, because of its relative safety, economic opportunities and availability of resources.<ref name="PESS" />
