It comprises 106 separate [[Municipalities of Yucatán|municipalities]], and its capital city is [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]].

Located on the northern part of the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], it is bordered by the states of [[Campeche]] to the southwest and [[Quintana Roo]] to the southeast, with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] off its northern coast.

Before the arrival of [[Conquistador|Spaniards]], the peninsula was a very important region for the [[Maya civilization]] that reached the peak of its development here, where the Maya founded the cities of [[Chichen Itza]], [[Izamal]], [[Motul, Yucatán|Motul]], [[Mayapan]], [[Ek' Balam]], and [[Ichkanzihóo]] (also called T'ho), now Mérida.

After the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] (early 16th to late 17th centuries), the Yucatán Peninsula became a single administrative and political entity, the [[Captaincy General of Yucatán]]. Following Mexican independence in 1821 the local Governor proclaimed independence. Yucatán became part of the [[First Mexican Empire]] in December 1821. Following the collapse of the Empire in March 1823, the [[Republic of Yucatan#Federal pact with Mexico|first Republic of Yucatán]] (founded in May 1823) voluntarily negotiated annexation to the [[First Mexican Republic|Federal Republic of United Mexican States]] on December 21, 1823. On March 16, 1841, as a result of cultural and political conflicts around the federal pact, Yucatán declared its independence from Mexico. forming a second [[Republic of Yucatán]]. Eventually on July 14, 1848, Yucatán was forced to rejoin Mexico. In 1858, in the middle of the [[Caste War of Yucatán]], the state of Yucatán was divided for the first time, establishing [[Campeche]] as a separate state (officially in 1863). During the [[Porfiriato]], in 1902, the state of Yucatán was divided again to form the Federal territory that later became the present state of [[Quintana Roo]].

== Etymology ==
{{See also|Yucatán Peninsula#Etymology}}
Before the arrival of [[Conquistador|Spaniards]] in the Yucatán Peninsula, the name of this region was ''Mayab''.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=de San Buenaventura |first1=Joseph |title=Historias de la conquista del Mayab, 1511–1697 |year=1994 |isbn=968-6843-59-0 |page=183 |publisher=Universidad Autónoma de Yucatán, Facultad de Ciencias Antropológicas}}</ref> In the [[Yucatec Maya]] language, ''mayab'' means "flat",<ref>{{cite book |last=Bricker |first=Victoria |year=1998 |title=Dictionary Of The Maya Language: As Spoken in Hocabá, Yucatán |publisher=University of Utah Press |page=181 |isbn=978-0874805697}}</ref> and is the source of the word "Maya" itself.

The name Yucatán, also assigned to the [[Yucatán Peninsula|peninsula]], came from early explorations of the [[Conquistadors]] from Europe. Three different explanations for the origin of the name have been proposed.

The first two state that the name resulted from confusion between the [[Maya people|Mayan inhabitants]] and the first Spanish explorers around 1517:
* According to one of them, Spaniards gave the name of Yucatán to the region because the Maya answered their questions with the phrase ''uh yu ka t'ann'', which in the [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya language]] means ''hear how they talk''.
* It is also said that it came from the answer of an indigenous Maya to the question of a Spanish explorer, who wanted to know the name of the region. The Maya probably replied ''Ma'anaatik ka t'ann'' which means in the Maya language ''I do not understand your speech'' or ''I do not understand you''.

Probably the first person to propose the "I do not understand" version was the friar [[Toribio de Benavente|Toribio de Benavente Motolinía]]. In his book ''Historia de los indios de la Nueva España'' (''History of the Indians of New Spain'') he says
<blockquote>because talking with those Indians of the coast, whatever the Spanish asked the Indians responded: ''Tectetán, Tectetán'' which means ''I don't understand you, I don't understand you''; they corrupted the word, and not understanding what the Indians said, they said: ''Yucatán is the name of this land''; and the same happened in a place, a cape, which they also called [[Cabo Catoche|Cape Cotoch]]; and ''Cotoch'' in that language means ''house''.{{sfn|de Motolinía|1858|p=196}}</blockquote>

The third proposed explanation comes from [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]]. In his book ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España]]'' (''True History of the Conquest of New Spain''), he says ''Yucatá'' means "land of [[Cassava|yucas]]",{{sfn|Díaz del Castillo|2005|p=22}} a plant that was cultivated by the Maya and was an important food source for them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.menendezymenendez.com/2007/09/cmo-se-alimentaron-las-multitudes-mayas.html |title=¿Cómo se alimentaban los mayas? |access-date=May 4, 2010 |archive-date=June 15, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615151253/http://www.menendezymenendez.com/2007/09/cmo-se-alimentaron-las-multitudes-mayas.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The origin of the first settlements has not been scientifically confirmed, although the presence of first humans in the area dates from the late [[Pleistocene]] or [[Quaternary glaciation|ice age]] (about 10,000–12,000 years), according to the findings in the [[Loltun Cave|Loltún caves]] and caverns of [[Tulum]] (Women of the Palms).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://especiales.yucatan.com.mx/especiales/rutapuuc/lol-tun_historia.asp |title=La Ruta Puuc |access-date=May 4, 2010 |author=Diario de Yucatán |date=January 2001 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100330015616/http://especiales.yucatan.com.mx/especiales/rutapuuc/lol-tun_historia.asp |archive-date=March 30, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

The first Maya moved to the Peninsula circa 250 CE, from the [[Petén Basin|Petén]] (today northern [[Guatemala]]), to settle the southeastern peninsula in the modern [[Bacalar, Quintana Roo]].{{sfn|Silva|2006|p=62}}{{sfn|de Landa|1984|p=19}} In 525, the [[Chané people|Chanés]] (Mayan tribe that preceded the [[Itza people|Itza]]), moved to the east of the peninsula, founding [[Chichén Itzá]], [[Izamal]], [[Motul, Yucatán|Motul]], [[Ek' Balam]], [[T'Hó|Ichcaanzihó]] (modern Mérida) and [[Champotón, Campeche|Champotón]].{{Harvard citation|Molina Solís|1896|p=33}} Later, [[Tutul Xiues|Tutul Xiúes]], [[Toltec]] descent, who came from the coast of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], settled in the region causing displacement of the Itza and Cocomes—a diversified branch of Itzá—and finally, after years and many battles, the [[League of Mayapan]] (composed of the Itza, the Xiús and Cocomes) was formed, which eventually disintegrated circa 1194,{{sfn|Molina Solís|1896|p=10}} giving way to a period of anarchy and fragmentation into small domains which the Spanish conquistadors found in the 16th century.{{sfn|Silva|2006|p=63}}

=== Exploration by Spanish soldiers ===
In 1513, [[Juan Ponce de León]] had already conquered the island of Borinquén (now [[Puerto Rico]]) and had visited Florida.<ref>{{cite web |author=Peck, Douglas T |title=Misconceptions and Myths Related to the Fountain of Youth and Juan Ponce de Leon's 1513 Exploration Voyage |url=http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf |publisher=New World Explorers, Inc |access-date=May 5, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409062720/http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf |archive-date=April 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> [[Antón de Alaminos]], who was with Ponce de León on this latest discovery, suspected that west of [[Cuba]] they could find new land. Under their influence, [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]], supported by the governor of Cuba, organized an expedition commanded by [[Francisco Hernández de Córdoba (Yucatán conquistador)|Francisco Hernández de Córdoba]] to explore the seas west of the island.{{sfn|López de Cogolludo|2007|p=21}}

This expedition sailed from port of Ajaruco on February 8, 1517, to [[La Habana]] and after circling the island and sailing southwest by what is now known as the [[Yucatán Channel]], the expedition made landfall at the [[Yucatán Peninsula]] on March 1. There are discrepancies about where the first explorers arrived. Some say it was in [[Isla Mujeres]]. [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] places it at [[Cabo Catoche]], where they saw a great city which they named the «Gran Cairo».{{sfn|López de Cogolludo|2007|p=22}}

=== Spanish conquest ===
{{Main|Spanish conquest of Yucatán}}

The conquest of Yucatán was completed two decades after the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] by [[Francisco de Montejo|Francisco de Montejo "el Adelantado"]], his son [[Francisco de Montejo y León (el Mozo)|Francisco de Montejo y León "el Mozo"]] and his nephew, [[Francisco de Montejo (the Nephew)|Francisco de Montejo "el Sobrino"]]. ''El Adelantado'' was in the expedition of [[Juan de Grijalva]] and was with [[Hernán Cortés]] in the third expedition that eventually became the Conquest of the Aztec Empire.{{sfn|López de Cogolludo|2007|p=68}} He was subsequently appointed for the conquest of the Maya of Yucatán, but failed in his first attempt in 1527–28. In 1529 he was appointed Governor of [[Tabasco]], with the order to pacify Tabasco and conquer Yucatán and [[Cozumel]].

From Tabasco, Montejo led a new campaign to Yucatán from the west (1531–35) and failed again in his attempt for conquest. Circa 1535, after many bloody battles with the natives, he reached the complete pacification of the Province of Tabasco and began planning his new foray to Yucatán.

''El Adelantado'' was appointed governor of [[Honduras]] and then of [[Chiapas]]. Therefore, he gave his son "El Mozo", the mission to consummate the conquest of Yucatán. Francisco de Montejo y León "el Mozo" founded the cities of [[Campeche, Campeche|San Francisco de Campeche]] on October 4, 1540, and [[Mérida (Yucatán)|Mérida]] on January 6, 1542 (in honor of [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]], Extremadura). The city of Mérida was founded over the ruins of the Mayan city of [[Ichkanzihóo]] (T'ho) and the stones of old Mayan pyramids were used for the new buildings. Later, government powers were changed from ''Santa María de la Victoria'', Tabasco, to Mérida on June 11, 1542.{{sfn|Ancona|1878|p=6}} The newly founded Mérida was besieged by the Mayan troops of [[Nachi Cocom]] (overlord or 'Halach uinik' in [[Yucatec Maya language|Mayan language]]). It was a definitive battle for the Conquest of Yucatán. With that victory, the Spaniards consolidated their control of the western part of the peninsula.

Francisco de Montejo "El Adelantado" appointed his nephew, Francisco de Montejo "el Sobrino", to head the conquest of the eastern Yucatán, which was achieved after many bloody battles, ending with the foundation of the city of [[Valladolid, Yucatán|Valladolid]] on May 28, 1543.

=== Canek rebellion, during the colonial Yucatán ===
{{Main|Jacinto Canek}}
Oppressive policies of inequality and prejudice were imposed on the native [[Maya peoples|Maya]] by the Spanish colonial government. In November 1761, [[Jacinto Canek]], a Mayan from the town of Cisteil (now located in [[Yaxcabá Municipality]]), led an armed uprising against the government, which was quickly put down. Captured insurgents were taken to [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]], where they were tried and tortured. As a warning to the population against rebellion, Cisteil was burned and covered with salt.

This abortive rebellion was not of great consequence to the colonial regime, but it marked the history of the peninsula and clearly delineated anti-colonial tensions in the region. The uprising was a precursor to the social upheaval that would explode less than a century later, as the [[Caste War of Yucatán|Caste War]]. The Canek rebellion is remembered today as a symbol of the racial and social conflict that predominated for centuries in the Spanish colonies.

=== Yucatán in independent Mexico ===
{{Main|Mexican War of Independence}}

Because of its geographical remoteness from the center of [[New Spain]], especially from [[Mexico City]], Yucatán was not militarily affected by the Mexican War of Independence, though the influence was felt in other ways. In 1820 Lorenzo de Zavala, member of Sanjuanistas (a group of creoles who met at the church of San Juan in downtown Mérida), created the ''Patriotic Confederation'', which eventually divided into two groups: the supporters of the Spanish government under the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|Cádiz Constitution]] and another led by Zavala, which sought outright independence from Spain. Mariano Carrillo Albornoz then Governor of Yucatán, sent Zavala and Manuel García Sosa as deputies of the [[Cortes of Cádiz]] to [[Madrid]], while the other liberals were imprisoned. While this was happening in Yucatán, the [[Plan of Iguala]] was proclaimed in the current state of [[Guerrero]] (at that time part of the Intendency of Mexico).

On September 15, 1821, in the Hall of Councils of the City of Mérida, Yucatán declared its independence from Spain.<ref>{{cite news |title=Datos de Interes |url=http://www.merida.gob.mx/historia/datos.html |language=es |access-date=April 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716104004/http://www.merida.gob.mx/historia/datos.html |archive-date=July 16, 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Almost immediately, Governor Juan María Echeverri sent two representatives to negotiate the incorporation of Yucatán into the [[First Mexican Empire|Mexican Empire]].

==== Republic of Yucatán ====
{{Main|Republic of Yucatán}}
The Mexican Empire was quickly overthrown (1823) under the [[Plan of Casa Mata]], and the provinces of the erstwhile empire became independent states. The first Republic of Yucatán, declared on May 29, 1823, joined the Federal Republic of the [[United Mexican States]] as the '''Federated Republic of Yucatán''' on December 23, 1823.<ref name=diputaciones>{{cite news |title=Las Diputaciones Provinciales |url=http://biblio.juridicas.unam.mx/libros/6/2920/11.pdf |page=15 |language=es |access-date=April 11, 2011 |archive-date=May 28, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160528111641/http://biblio.juridicas.unam.mx/libros/6/2920/11.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=La Historia de la República de Yucatán |url=http://www.sobrino.net/Dzidzantun/la_historia_de_la_rep_yuc.htm |language=es |access-date=October 31, 2010 |archive-date=June 6, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606142635/http://www.sobrino.net/Dzidzantun/la_historia_de_la_rep_yuc.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=La Diputación Provincial y el Federalismo Mexicano |isbn=9789681205867 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i_GK_-6deKIC&q=22%20De%20Mayo%20De%201824%20durango&pg=PA227 |language=es |last1=Benson |first1=Nettie Lee |year=1994 |access-date=October 21, 2020 |archive-date=October 20, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231020054309/https://books.google.com/books?id=i_GK_-6deKIC&q=22%20De%20Mayo%20De%201824%20durango&pg=PA227#v=snippet&q=22%20De%20Mayo%20De%201824%20durango&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

The second Republic of Yucatán{{efn|Usually when historians talk about of the Republic of Yucatán, they are talking about the second republic.}} emerged when the federal pact signed by Yucatán and endorsed in the Constitution of Yucatán of 1825 was broken by the [[Centralized government|centralist government]] of Mexico from 1835. In 1841 the state of [[Tabasco]] decreed its separation from Mexico and [[Miguel Barbachano]], then governor of Yucatán, sent a commission headed by [[Justo Sierra O'Reilly]] to meet with Tabasco authorities to propose the creation of an independent federal republic from Mexico formed by the two states. The idea failed when Tabasco rejoined Mexico in 1842.

On August 22, 1846, Mexican interim president [[José Mariano Salas]] restored the [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 constitution]] and federalism. Two years later, during the government of president [[José Joaquín de Herrera]], [[Miguel Barbachano]] ordered the reinstatement of Yucatán to Mexico under the Constitution of Yucatán of 1825. A decisive factor for the reinstatement was the [[Caste War]], which forced Yucatán to seek outside help. In 1852 due to internal struggles between opposing political factions, the ''Territory of Campeche'' was created. On April 29, 1863, during the government of Mexican President [[Benito Juárez]], Campeche gained its current status as an independent state.<ref>{{cite news |title=SEP |url=http://www2.sepdf.gob.mx/efemerides/consulta_efemerides.jsp?dia=29&mes=4 |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026155634/http://www2.sepdf.gob.mx/efemerides/consulta_efemerides.jsp?dia=29&mes=4 |archive-date=October 26, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==== Flag of the Republic of Yucatán ====
{{Main|Flag of the Republic of Yucatán}}
[[File:Bandera yucateca en Mérida.png|thumb|[[Flag of the Republic of Yucatán]]]]
The flag of Yucatán was raised on March 16, 1841. The period of the Republic of Yucatán was the only one in which the banner was officially used by the authorities of Yucatán.

[[Rodolfo Menéndez de la Peña]], historian, describes the flag of Yucatán: "The flag of Yucatán was divided into two parts: green on left, the right, with three divisions, red up and down and white in the middle. In the green field highlighted, five stars, symbolizing the five departments that Yucatan was divided by decree of November 30, 1840: Mérida, Izamal, Valladolid, Tekax and Campeche."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://especiales.yucatan.com.mx:80/especiales/banderadeyucatan/14090001.asp |title=Las estrellas y la vigencia de la bandera de Yucatán |last=Esquivel |first=Duran |date=2002-09-14 |website=Diario de Yucatán |language=es |trans-title=The Stars and Effect of the Flag of Yucatan |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520062633/http://especiales.yucatan.com.mx/especiales/banderadeyucatan/14090001.asp |archive-date=May 20, 2012 |url-status=dead |access-date=2017-05-11 |quote=... la bandera yucateca se dividió en dos campos: a la izquierda, uno de color verde, y a la derecha, otro con tres divisiones, de color rojo arriba y abajo y blanco en medio.

The flag did not have official recognition in the state {{failed verification span|text=until August 2024,|date=August 2024}} however, it maintained a strong recognition among the people of the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yucatan.com.mx/especiales/banderadeyucatan/14090001.asp |archive-url=https://archive.today/20100225084559/http://www.yucatan.com.mx/especiales/banderadeyucatan/14090001.asp |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 25, 2010 |title=160 aniversario de la Bandera de Yucatán |author=Diario de Yucatán |access-date=August 10, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yucatan.com.mx/vidasocial.asp?cx=4$1306000000$4235820&f=20100130 |title=Buenos Aires City, anfitrión de un evento al estilo de Las Vegas |author=Diario de Yucatán |access-date=August 26, 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==== Caste War ====
{{Main|Caste War of Yucatán}}
The Caste War of Yucatán was a conflict that lasted from 1847 to 1901. It began with the revolt of native Maya people led by Maya chiefs [[Jacinto Pat]] and [[Cecilio Chi]], against the population of European descent called "Yucatecos", who had political and economic control. A lengthy war ensued between the Yucateco forces in the north-west of the Yucatán and the independent Maya in the south-east. It officially ended with the occupation of the Maya capital of [[Chan Santa Cruz]] by the Mexican army in 1901, although skirmishes with villages and small settlements that refused to acknowledge Mexican control continued for over another decade.

Adam Jones wrote: "This ferocious race war featured genocidal atrocities on both sides, with up to 200,000 killed."<ref>Nicholas A. Robins, Adam Jones (2009). "''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AX3UCk_PdEwC Genocides by the Oppressed: Subaltern Genocide in Theory and Practice]''". Indiana University Press. p. 50. {{ISBN|0253220777}}</ref>

Because of the conflict, on November 24, 1902, Yucatán had a second territorial division when [[Porfirio Díaz]] decreed the creation of the '''Federal Territory of Quintana Roo''',<ref name="Yucatán en el tiempo">{{Cite book |last1=Casares G.

In little more than half a century, Yucatán lost more than two thirds of its original territory.

==== The henequen industry ====
{{main|Henequen industry in Yucatán}}
[[File:Plantsisal.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Agave fourcroydes]], commonly known as [[henequén]] in Yucatán, [[sisal]] elsewhere and ''ki'' in [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya language]]]]
In the late 19th century, the henequen industry grew to unprecedented power in the Yucatan. The henequen grown in the Yucatan was used around the world for rope and twine, and became known as sisal rope, named after the seaside town of Sisal, from where the rope was shipped. Today Sisal is a sleepy fishing village, being rediscovered by locals and visitors as a beach location for vacation homes. The henequen industry provided financial autonomy to the isolated Yucatán. The fiber of the [[henequén]] plant (known as ''sosquil'' (maya: ''sos kí'')) was manufactured into twine and rope, used in riggings, string, sacks, rugs, and many other items. It became the chief export item of the Yucatán, making many local families very wealthy. That wealth is today evident in the architecture of the colonial city of Mérida, as well as in the more than 150 haciendas that are spread throughout the Yucatán Peninsula.

[[Koreans in Mexico|Korean immigration]] to Mexico began in 1905. The first Korean migrants settled in Yucatán as workers in henequen plantations. Labour brokers began advertising in newspapers in the Korean port city of [[Incheon]] in 1904 for workers willing to go to Mexico to work on henequen plantations for four- or five-year contracts.{{cn|date=March 2023}} A total of more than one thousand were recruited and departed from Incheon on board a British cargo ship on 4 April 1905, despite efforts by the Korean government to block their departure. Once their contracts were up, most settled in Mexico, either continuing to work on henequen plantations or moving to various cities in the country.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

Hundreds of prosperous [[hacienda]]s abounded in the state until the advent of synthetic products after World War II, the cultivation of henequén in other parts of the world and the self-serving actions of some of the leading henequen-growing families led to the gradual decline of the Yucatan's monopoly on the industry.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

The great influx of wealth during that period from the henequen industry focused mainly on Mérida, the capital of Yucatán State. It allowed the city of Mérida to install [[street light]]s and a tram system even before [[Mexico City]]. It is said that in the early 20th century, the city had the largest number of millionaires per capita in the world. Today, [[Paseo de Montejo]] (inspired by the Parisian avenue [[Champs-Élysées]]), is lined with the elegant houses built during that time. These houses are mostly now renovated and serve as everything from private homes to banks, hotels and restaurants. Many of the haciendas today<ref>{{cite web |last=Fields |first=Ellen |title=Haciendas of the Yucatan |url=http://www.yucatanliving.com/destinations/yucatan-haciendas.htm |work=Yucatan Living |access-date=May 11, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150506005012/http://www.yucatanliving.com/destinations/yucatan-haciendas.htm |archive-date=May 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> have also been renovated and now serve as private homes, event venues and upscale luxury hotels.

=== Late 20th century ===
Until the mid-20th century most of Yucatán's contact with the outside world was by sea; trade with the US and Cuba, as well as Europe and other Caribbean islands, was more significant than that with the rest of Mexico. In the 1950s Yucatán was linked to the rest of Mexico by railway, followed by highway in the 1960s, ending the region's comparative isolation. Today Yucatán still demonstrates a unique culture from the rest of Mexico, including its own style of food.

Commercial jet airplanes began arriving in Mérida in the 1960s, and additional international airports were built first in [[Cozumel]] and then in the new planned resort community of [[Cancún]] in the 1980s, making tourism a major force in the economy of the Yucatán Peninsula.

The first Maya governor of Yucatán, [[Francisco Luna Kan]], was elected in 1976.

Today, the Yucatán Peninsula is a major tourism destination, as well as home to one of the largest indigenous populations in Mexico, the [[Maya peoples|Maya people]].

== Geography ==
The State of Yucatán is located on the [[Yucatán Peninsula]]. It borders the states of [[Campeche]] to the southwest, [[Quintana Roo]] to the east and southeast, and the [[Gulf of Mexico]] to the north and west. As a whole, the state is extremely flat with little or no [[topographic]] variation, with the exception of the [[Puuc]] hills, located in the southern portion of the state.

=== Languages ===
[[File:WIKITONGUES- Manuel speaking Yucatecan.webm|thumb|A Yucatec Maya speaker]]
The most widespread indigenous language of Yucatán is [[Yucatec Maya]], spoken natively by approximately 800,000 people in Yucatán and adjacent Quintana Roo and Campeche, especially in rural areas. The Spanish spoken in Yucatán has lexical and some phonological borrowing from Mayan and employs many words of Mayan origin, such as ''{{lang|myn|purux}}'' ("fat"), ''{{lang|myn|tuch}}'' ("navel") and ''{{lang|myn|wixar}}'' ("urinate").

=== Korean immigration ===
In 1905, 1,003 Korean immigrants – 802 men and 231 women and children – departed from the port of [[Incheon|Chemulpo]], Incheon, aboard the ship ''Ilford'' to Salina Cruz, Oaxaca. The journey took 45 days, after which they took a train to [[Coatzacoalcos (municipality)|Coatzacoalcos]], Veracruz. At Coatzacoalcos, another boat was taken to the port of [[Progreso Municipality, Yucatán|Progreso]], with the final destination being the city of Mérida.<ref>{{Citation |last=CorMexCamp |title=Inmigración coreana a México |date=2010-01-19 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUHhp7pATt8 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211107/YUHhp7pATt8 |archive-date=2021-11-07 |url-status=live |access-date=2016-06-14}}{{cbignore}}</ref> They arrived in May 1905, with previously signed contracts for four years' work as indentured laborers on the Yucatán [[Agave fourcroydes|henequen]] haciendas.

This rapid intermarriage by Koreans, coupled with geographic dispersal, prevented the establishment of close social networks among these migrants and therefore provided the basis for Korean descendants across the Yucatán Peninsula.<ref name=":0" /> After that 1905 ship, no further entries of Koreans into Mexico were recorded until many years later, leading to a new community of Koreans with completely different characteristics from those who entered in 1905.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hyong-Ju |first=Kim |date=2003 |title=La experiencia migratoria de la nueva comunidad coreana en México |journal=Second Meeting on Korean Studies in Latin America, Centro de Estudios de Asia y África, Korea Foundation/Colmex/UBA}}</ref>

== Government and politics ==

=== Government ===
The [[Constitution of Yucatán]] provides that the government of Yucatán, like the government of every other state in Mexico, consists of three [[political power|powers]]: the executive, the [[legislature|legislative]] and the [[judiciary]].

Executive power rests in the [[governor of Yucatán]], who is directly elected by the citizens, using a secret ballot, to a six-year term with no possibility of reelection. Legislative power rests in the [[Congress of Yucatán]] which is a [[unicameral legislature]] composed of 25 deputies. Judicial power is invested in the High Court of Justice of Yucatán and its district courts.

=== Municipalities ===
{{Main|Municipalities of Yucatán}}

The State of Yucatán is divided into 106 municipalities, each headed by a [[municipal president]] (mayor). Usually municipalities are named after the city that serves as municipal seat; e.g. the municipal seat of the [[Mérida (municipality)|municipality of Mérida]] is the city of [[Mérida, Yucatán|Mérida]].

=== Politics ===
The [[2024 Mexican local elections|2024 local election]] in Yucatán was held on 2 June. [[Joaquín Díaz Mena]] was elected to succeed [[Mauricio Vila Dosal]] as governor.<ref>{{cite news |title=Oficializan en Yucatán el triunfo de Huacho Díaz |url=https://www.excelsior.com.mx/nacional/oficializan-en-yucatan-el-triunfo-de-huacho-diaz/1656628 |access-date=13 August 2024 |work=Excélsior |date=10 June 2024}}</ref>

==Media==
[[List of newspapers in Mexico|Newspapers]] of Yucatán include: ''Artículo 7'', ''De Peso (Mérida)'', ''Diario de Yucatán'', ''La I Noticias para Mí Mérida'', ''Milenio Novedades (Antes El Mundo al Día)'', and ''Por Esto! (Yucatán).''<ref name=SIC>{{cite web |work=Sistema de Información Cultural |publisher=Gobierno de Mexico |language=es |access-date=March 7, 2020 |url=https://sic.gob.mx/lista.php?table=impresos&disciplina=&estado_id=31 |title=Publicaciones periódicas en Yucatán |archive-date=March 2, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210302220530/https://sic.gob.mx/lista.php?table=impresos&disciplina=&estado_id=31 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://libguides.utsa.edu/latamnews |title=Latin American & Mexican Online News |work=Research Guides |publisher=[[University of Texas at San Antonio Libraries]] |location=US |archive-date=March 7, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200307192643/http://libguides.utsa.edu/latamnews}}</ref>

== Food ==
Yucatecan food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people would consider Mexican food. It includes influences from the local Mayan culture,<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Yucatán Adventure |url=https://www.foodandwine.com/news/a-yucatan-adventure |access-date=2021-08-17 |website=Food & Wine |language=en |archive-date=August 17, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210817222121/https://www.foodandwine.com/news/a-yucatan-adventure |url-status=live }}</ref> as well as Caribbean, European (Spanish), (North) African, and Middle Eastern cultures, as well as influence from the cuisine of other parts of Mexico.

There are many regional dishes. Some of them are:
*''[[Poc Chuc]]'', a Mayan/Yucatecan version of barbecued pork.
*''[[Salbute]]s and [[Panucho]]s''. ''Salbutes'' are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey, and avocado on top. ''Panuchos'' feature fried tortillas filled with black beans and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. [[Habanero chili|Habanero]] chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or puréed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.
*''[[Queso relleno]]'', a "gourmet" dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved Edam cheese ball served with tomato sauce and gravy.
*''Pavo en Relleno Negro'', a turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the ''mole de guajalote'' found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in ''panuchos'' or ''salbutes'' and is usually referred to as "Relleno negro".
*''[[Lime soup|Sopa de Lima]]'', a lime-flavored soup with meat (turkey, chicken, or pork), served with tortilla chips.
*''[[Papadzule]]s'', egg tacos covered in pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.
*''[[Cochinita pibil|Cochinita Pibil]]'', a marinated pork dish and by far the most renowned of Yucatecan food.
*''[[Xcatik]]'', a type of chili.
*''Pavo en Relleno Blanco'' (or simply "Relleno Blanco"), a turkey stew almost like ''Pavo en Relleno Negro''.
*[[Xnipec]], a fiery hot salsa or relish similar to [[pico de gallo]], made with habanero chiles and [[Seville orange]] juice
