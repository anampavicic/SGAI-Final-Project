Its current mayor is Luciano di Nápoli. 
Founded in 1892 by Tomás Mason, Santa Rosa did not develop into a relatively important agricultural centre until the second half of the 20th century. It is still one of the smallest provincial capitals of the country after [[Patagonia]]n [[Rawson, Chubut|Rawson]], [[Ushuaia]] and [[Viedma, Río Negro|Viedma]].

==Geography==
[[File:Plano Ciudad de Santa Rosa.svg|thumbnail|right|Street map of Santa Rosa downtown]]
Santa Rosa was founded on the western edge of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[Pampas]], in the range of contact of two different natural environments: the end of the plain and the beginning of the land of the Pampas broken valley.

The town occupies part of a centripetal basin having their base in Don Tomás Lagoon, where rainwater drains from the surrounding area. The floor area lies west of it, in hilly terrain where the highest elevations are in the east, with two small plateaus located 200 meters. This high turnover is also observed north, with heights up to 195 meters. From here the terrain descends to the west and south, with slopes that are steep in some areas, since more than 3%. The southwest sector is lower and less undulating area, descending to 167 masl.

===Climate===
Santa Rosa has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa/Cwa'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with warm to hot summers and chilly, dry winters.
