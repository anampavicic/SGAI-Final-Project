[[File:Klaus Schwab - World Economic Forum on the Middle East Dead Sea Jordan 2007.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Madaba Governorate hosts the [[World Economic Forum]] held on its [[Dead Sea]] coasts]]

===Biblical and ancient history===
Many sites in Madaba Governorate are considered biblical sites, some of which are:
* [[Mount Nebo (Jordan)|Mount Nebo]]: according to the [[Bible]], is the site where [[Moses]] viewed the [[Land of Israel|Promised Land]].  Mount Nebo, just west of Madaba city, formed part of the Madaba Diocese during Byzantine times. Here the mosaics discovered at the Moses Memorial together with those in the churches in the village of Nebo, in the 'Uyun Musa valley and at 'Ayn al-Kanisah carry inscriptions which date them to the times of the Bishops of Madaba from the late fifth century to the middle of the eighth century AD. 
* [[Um er-Rasas]] (Kastron Mefaa): lies on the southeastern steppes, also formed part of the diocese, laying as it is close to the [[Wadi Mujib]] (Arnon river), a natural boundary of the Province. Here were brought to light the splendid mosaics of the Saint Stephen Complex together with the Church of the Lions (sixth-eighth centuries AD), which complement the eighth-century mosaic discovered in the village of Ma'in.
* [[Mukawer]]: 15&nbsp;km south of Madaba city, is where the Body of Saint [[John the Baptist]] supposedly lies after he was beheaded at the request of King [[Herod Antipas]]' niece. The site is located on top of a big mountain rising from the shores of the [[Dead Sea]] and overlooking most of the Dead Sea and ancient Israel.
