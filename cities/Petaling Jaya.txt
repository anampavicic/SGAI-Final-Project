'''Petaling Jaya''' ({{IPA|zsm|pətalɪŋ dʒaja|lang}}), colloquially referred to as "'''PJ'''", is a city in [[Petaling District]], in the state of [[Selangor]], [[Malaysia]]. Originally developed as a [[Satellite city|satellite township]] for [[Kuala Lumpur]], the capital of Malaysia, it is part of the [[Greater Kuala Lumpur]] area. Petaling Jaya was granted city status on 20 June 2006. It has an area of approximately {{convert|97.2|km2|1|abbr=out}}.

Petaling Jaya is surrounded by Kuala Lumpur to the east, [[Sungai Buloh]] to the north, [[Shah Alam]], the capital of Selangor, and [[Subang Jaya]] to the west, and [[Bandar Kinrara]] ([[Puchong]]) to the south.

== History ==
Under plans developed by [[Francis McWilliams]],<ref name="Star">{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/metro/metro-news/2022/09/02/francis-mcwilliams-engineer-behind-pj039s-development-passes-away-at-96 | title=Francis McWilliams, engineer behind PJ's development, passes away at 96 |work=The Star |access-date=5 September 2022}}</ref> the city was developed during post-war [[British Malaya]] on a piece of {{convert|1200|acres|0|abbr=on}} rubber estate, the ''Effingham Estate'', around Old Klang Road to address the overpopulation of the capital [[Kuala Lumpur]] in the 1950s.<ref>{{cite web|title=Executive Summary|url=http://www.mbpj.gov.my/web/guest/ringkasan-eksekutif|website=Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya (MBPJ)|access-date=2 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418182252/http://www.mbpj.gov.my/web/guest/ringkasan-eksekutif|archive-date=18 April 2015|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Since 1952, PJ witnessed a dramatic growth in terms of population size and geographical importance. The development of Petaling Jaya commenced in 1952 with the construction of 800 houses centred on the area known as "Old Town" today.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Lieutenant-General Sir [[Gerald Templer]] (then the British High Commissioner of Malaya and Petaling District council chairman) planned for Petaling Jaya to be a satellite town to prevent people from assisting the communists; the earlier housing areas were fenced off from the surrounding area. The first two main roads built in Petaling Jaya were simply called "Jalan 1" or Road 1 and "Jalan 2" or Road 2. Road 1 was later named [[Jalan Templer]] while Road 2 was named Jalan Othman after Othman Mohamad, former [[Menteri Besar of Selangor|Menteri Besar]] (Chief Minister) of Selangor.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

Until the end of 1953, the town was administered by the [[Kuala Lumpur City Hall|Kuala Lumpur district officer]]. The Petaling Jaya Town Authority headed by N.A.J. Kennedy commenced administering Petaling Jaya in 1954. On 24 August 1959, Encik Abdul Aziz bin Haji Mohd Ali became the first Malayan to head the PJ Authority. Administratively and historically, it was considered part of Kuala Lumpur. However, Petaling Jaya ceased to be part of Kuala Lumpur when the latter became a Federal Territory on 1 February 1974. It then became a township in its own right within the state of [[Selangor]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

[[Petaling Garden Berhad]] was the pioneer private development company, responsible for the development of some areas of Petaling Jaya. It was started in 1957 by a group of Chinese businessmen including [[Ang Toon Chew]], [[Robert Kuok]], [[Tan Kim Yeow]], [[Tan Chin Nam]], [[Ho Yeow Khoon]] and [[Low Boon Chian]]. The company went on to develop ''thousands of acres'' in Petaling Jaya more specifically, Section 5, 6 and 17, to become the townships Taman Petaling Klang and Sri Petaling to name a few.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Learning from pioneer entrepreneurs in the history of M'sia|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2018/10/24/learning-from-pioneer-entrepreneurs-in-the-history-of-msia|access-date=2021-07-08|website=The Star|language=en}}</ref> Petaling Garden was brought to the [[Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange]] and became one of the first publicly listed Property Development Companies in [[Malaysia]]. The company was bought over by [[Permodalan Nasional Berhad|Permodalan Nasional Berhad (PNB)]] in the year 2007, it was valued at RM 964 million at time of purchase.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Idris|first=Izwan|title=Petaling Garden also going private|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2007/04/28/petaling-garden-also-going-private|access-date=2021-07-08|website=The Star|language=en}}</ref>

Southern Petaling Jaya, from Section 8 to PJ Old Town, had the first settlements that were established around 1953. As development progressed, Northern Petaling Jaya, on the other side of the [[Federal Highway, Malaysia|Federal Highway]] was developed.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} The first shopping complex in Petaling Jaya was [[Jaya Supermarket|Jaya Shopping Centre]] (better known as Jaya Supermarket). Built in 1974, it is located in Section 14.

On 1 January 1977, following the passing of the [[Local Government Act 1976|Local Government Act the previous year]], the Petaling Jaya Town Authority was reorganised to become Petaling Jaya [[Municipal]] Council or Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya (MPPJ). Petaling Jaya progressed rapidly due to the massive rural-urban [[Immigration|migration]]. As more people from rural areas immigrated, Sungai Way and Subang districts along with areas such as [[Subang Jaya]], Seksyen 52 (New Town or colloquially known as "State", the name of the first, former cinema in the area) developed in areas under the jurisdiction of the municipality.

[[File:PJ SA Evolution.svg|600px|thumb|left|Evolution of Petaling Jaya's borders since 1977]]

Following a boundary realignment exercise in January 1997, parts of Petaling Jaya including [[Subang Jaya]], [[UEP Subang Jaya|USJ]], [[Putra Heights]], and [[Bandar Sunway]] were ceded to the newly formed [[Subang Jaya City Council|Subang Jaya Municipal Council]] or MPSJ at the time. In exchange, the MPPJ annexed [[Bandar Utama]], [[Sungai Buloh]], [[Bukit Lanjan]], and [[Kota Damansara]] from the Petaling District Council (''Majlis Daerah Petaling'', MDP), which disestablished itself after the cession.

Due to the proximity of the city to the capital of Malaysia, Petaling Jaya had and have been the headquarters of many federal government departments such as the Jabatan Pendaftaran Negara (National Registration Department, 1958–2004),<ref>{{cite web|title=National Registration Department|url=http://www.jpn.gov.my/en/maklumatkorporat/pengenalan/|access-date=21 Aug 2015|archive-date=19 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160519010852/http://www.jpn.gov.my/en/maklumatkorporat/pengenalan/|url-status=dead}}</ref> the Jabatan Arkib Negara Malaysia (Malaysian National Archive Department, 1961–1982),<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkib Negara Malaysia|url=http://www.arkib.gov.my/web/guest/sejarah|access-date=21 Aug 2015|archive-date=2 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171102151648/http://www.arkib.gov.my/web/guest/sejarah|url-status=dead}}</ref> and the Jabatan Kimia Malaysia (Malaysian Chemistry Department, 1957–).<ref>{{cite web|title=Jabatan Kimia Malaysia|url=http://www.kimia.gov.my/bm/profil/sejarah.html|access-date=21 Aug 2015|archive-date=23 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423152214/http://www.kimia.gov.my/bm/profil/sejarah.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===COVID-19 pandemic===

In 2020, the city was part of the nationwide COVID-19 lockdown, or the movement control order (MCO), where residents were confined to their homes and only allowed out for essential purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Star|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/03/16/malaysia-announces-restricted-movement-measure-after-spike-in-covid-19-cases|access-date=12 Oct 2020}}</ref>

On April 27, the market in the city's oldest quarter, [[Old Town, Petaling Jaya|Old Town]], was shut down<ref>{{cite web|title=The Edge Markets| date=10 May 2020 |url=https://www.theedgemarkets.com/article/covid19-pj-oldtown-placed-under-lockdown-about-2900-residents-affected|website=Theedgemarkets.com|access-date=12 Oct 2020}}</ref> down after a seafood trader there tested positive for the virus, prompting health authorities to call for customers to get themselves screened.

Less than two weeks later, large parts of Old Town came under a full government lockdown on May 10 after the discovery of 26 COVID-19 cases from the market area. Over 2,900 people in the quarter were fenced in and prevented from leaving the area, as authorities cordoned off 40ha of the area with barb wire from the rest of the city. Scheduled to last until May 23, the lockdown was eventually lifted on May 21.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Star|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/05/21/enhanced-mco-in-parts-of-pj-old-town-lifted-barbed-wire-fences-removed|website=Thestar.com.my|access-date=12 Oct 2020}}</ref>

After a lull in cases thanks to a nationwide lifting of restrictions, the city began to see a rise in cases in October following a spike in virus infections after infections rose in the eastern state of Sabah, where elections were held in September.

Over 800 people working at the Tropicana Golf and Country Resort were barred from leaving their hostel, as authorities put the compound under a total lockdown.<ref>{{cite web|title=Covid-19: Enhanced MCO for Tropicana Resort workers' hostel|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/10/10/covid-19-enhanced-mco-for-tropicana-resort-workers-hostel-from-1201am-monday-oct-12|website=Thestar.com.my|access-date=12 October 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Enhanced MCO on resort workers' dorms in Petaling Jaya| date=10 October 2020 |url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/546011|website=Malaysiakini.com|access-date=12 October 2020}}</ref> Five people there tested positive for Covid 19, including two who had just returned from the eastern state of Sabah.<ref>{{cite web|title=Covid-19: Close contacts of Tropicana Resort employees who tested positive undergoing mandatory 14-day quarantine

== Climate ==
Petaling Jaya is one of the wettest cities in Malaysia. It is warm with an average maximum of 30 degrees Celsius and receives heavy rainfall all year round, roughly more than {{convert|3300|mm|in|abbr=on}} of average rainfall annually. The city has no particular true dry season, but June and July are the driest months. Mostly each month average rainfall receives more than {{convert|200|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Thunderstorms and extreme rainstorms are common, and it is one of the highest lightning strike areas in the world. But due to normal global temperature variations, Petaling Jaya is experiencing severe drought with frequent water rationing among neighbourhoods.

The local administration of Petaling Jaya is carried out by [[Petaling Jaya City Council]] (Majlis Bandaraya Petaling Jaya, MBPJ), formerly known as Petaling Jaya Authority from 1954 until 1977 and Petaling Jaya Municipal Council (Majlis Perbandaran Petaling Jaya, MPPJ) from 1977 until 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2006/8/17/central/15161671&sec=central |title=Archives &#124; The Star Online |website=Thestar.com.my |date=17 August 2006 |access-date=9 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120224222114/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2006%2F8%2F17%2Fcentral%2F15161671&sec=central |archive-date=24 February 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Six mayors have been appointed since Petaling Jaya was awarded city status on 20 June 2006. The current mayor is Mohamad Azhan Md. Azmir, who has been in office since 21 October 2021.

The residents of Petaling Jaya are served by four [[Members of Parliament]] from [[Pakatan Harapan]], which is DAP's [[Gobind Singh Deo]] in {{pseat|Damansara}}, PKR's [[Lee Chean Chung]] in {{pseat|Petaling Jaya}}, PKR's [[Ramanan Ramakrishnan]] in {{pseat|Sungai Buloh}} and PKR's [[Wong Chen]] in {{pseat|Subang}}.

==City sections==
[[File:Petaling Jaya City Sections.svg|230px|thumb|right|Petaling Jaya city sections]]
{{See also|List of Petaling Jaya city sections}}
Petaling Jaya is divided into several sections. Some are subdivided into smaller neighbourhoods (''kejiranan''), for example SS5D. Some sections have their own names (SS1 as Kampung Tunku), while other sections are grouped together (SS3, SS4, SS5, SS6 and SS7 as part of Kelana Jaya). Besides that, Petaling Jaya also comprises the affluent township of [[Damansara, Kuala Lumpur|Damansara]]. SS is not the same as Seksyen but as the short acronym for Sungai Way-Subang instead.<ref>{{Cite web |title=QuickCheck: Does the 'SS' in SS2 mean Sungai Way-Subang? |url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/true-or-not/2023/03/24/quickcheck-does-the-039ss039-in-ss2-mean-sungai-way-subang |access-date=2023-05-18 |website=The Star |language=en}}</ref>

==Demographics==
{{As of|2014}}, Petaling Jaya claimed 613,977 residents living in the area of {{convert|51.4|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=off}}. The actual population by 2015 would have been a little over 550,000 residents without taking into account the total population of the Kuala Lumpur-Petaling Jaya conurbation which would have resulted in a total population of 1.5&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/malaysia-population/cities/ |title = Population of Cities in Malaysia (2021)|website=Worldpopulationreview.com}}</ref>

==Landmarks==
[[File:Kota Darul Ehsan (230405) 03.jpg|thumb|The Kota Darul Ehsan arch over the [[Federal Highway, Malaysia|Federal Highway]], marking the entrance to Petaling Jaya from Kuala Lumpur.]]
A prominent landmark in PJ is the [[Kota Darul Ehsan]] arch which symbolically marks the boundary between [[Kuala Lumpur]] and Petaling Jaya. This arch straddled the [[Federal Highway, Malaysia|Federal Highway (Lebuhraya Persekutuan)]] which was originally the only highway link between Petaling Jaya and Kuala Lumpur. However, many links now exist as alternatives to the congested Federal Highway.

Close to the Kelana Jaya Line's [[Taman Jaya LRT station|Taman Jaya station]] is the [[Petaling Jaya Museum]], as well as the Thai [[Wat Chetawan]] temple. This ornate building is very popular amongst the Buddhist community. A short drive ahead is PJ State, the nickname for the Central Business District of Petaling Jaya with the landmark Menara MBPJ as a focal point. PJ State is more formally referred to as PJ New Town.

The 1980s saw the establishment of shopping malls like The Atria in [[Damansara Jaya]] and [[Subang Parade]] in the nearby suburb or satellite town of [[Subang Jaya]]. The Atria provided the opportunity for residents to patronise either the Japanese Kimisawa or the French [[Printemps]] department stores, as well as a [[Burger King]] restaurant.

[[File:Seksyen 14 Petaling Jaya.jpg|thumb|The commercial area in Seksyen 14 Petaling Jaya at night.]]

In 1995, [[1 Utama]] commenced operations at Bandar Utama. [[JUSCO|Jaya Jusco]], a Japanese department store which had operated since 1984 at Taman Tun Dr Ismail later relocated as one of the anchor tenants of 1 Utama.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[Lotus's]] (formerly [[Tesco]]) supermarket commenced operations in [[Mutiara Damansara]] in 2003. This was quickly followed by the Ikano Power Centre (now renamed as [[IPC Shopping Centre]]) in 2004 and [[The Curve (shopping mall)|The Curve]] in 2005. At about the same time, the 1 Utama new wing had commenced operations, which then became the largest shopping mall in Malaysia (or currently 12th largest shopping mall in the world).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[File:Dataran Sunway.jpg|thumb|The Dataran Sunway commercial hub in Kota Damansara, Petaling Jaya]]

In 2004, Giant Hypermarket commenced operations in [[Kelana Jaya]]. This complex houses the [[Giant Hypermarket]] and some shops to create a more shopping centre style. It was easily accessed off the Damansara–Puchong Expressway. It was eventually closed down permanently on 26 November 2023 as the land was bought by a developer to make way for a new condominium. Located right opposite across the LDP is Paradigm Mall, which opened in mid-2012. Paradigm Mall was developed by WCT on the former Kelana Jaya garbage landfill.

==Properties in Petaling Jaya==
Active property developers in Petaling Jaya are PKNS, Sunway Bhd, Tropicana Bhd, AmCorp, Mah Sing Group and Guocoland as well as many others. Due to the size of Petaling Jaya township, property development in the area also includes small to medium-sized developers such as Sri Aman Development and Nusmetro.

Before the rapid development and commercialisation of Petaling Jaya, there were only a handful of residential developments that comprises mostly low to medium-cost apartments as well as terrace houses. By 2005, luxurious condominiums, semi-detached houses, and bungalows are a common sight within the area.

[[File:Kelana Jaya station (Kelana Jaya Line), Petaling Jaya, Selangor.jpg|alt=|thumb|The [[Kelana Jaya LRT station]] on the [[Kelana Jaya Line]]]]
===Bus===
Bus services were initially provided by Sri Jaya between the early 1950s until the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} Some SEA Park residents may recall the old Sri Jaya [[British Leyland|Leyland]] [[Albion Motors|Albion]] buses on the No. 241 service struggling to climb the relatively steep Jalan 21/1.

The introduction of the IntraKota bus system by [[DRB-HICOM]] saw the replacement of Sri Jaya and the mini-buses by the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Around the same time, some of the Petaling Jaya-Kuala Lumpur bus routes were serviced by Metrobus.

The introduction of the [[Kelana Jaya Line|PUTRA-LRT]] [[light rapid transit]] service in 1998 saw the addition of the Putraline feeder bus services.

The ownership of the PUTRA-LRT and its Putraline feeder bus services, as well as the IntraKota bus system, were taken over by [[Prasarana Malaysia]] in 2002 and 2004 respectively, eventually transferring all rail and bus operations to the [[Rapid KL]] system. Today, most of the public transportation in the form of busses in Petaling Jaya is operated by [[Rapid Bus]] under the Rapid KL brand, which also operates bus services in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the rest of the [[Klang Valley]] area. Rapid Bus also operates the PJ City Bus, a free bus service funded by the Petaling Jaya City Council.

===Rail===
{{Main|Klang Valley Integrated Transit System|KTM ETS}}
There are currently three [[rapid transit]] lines and one [[commuter rail]] line serving Petaling Jaya. These lines also provide connections to a [[bus rapid transit]] line and a [[inter-city rail]] service.

The PUTRA-LRT line, subsequently renamed {{rint|my|5}} [[LRT Kelana Jaya Line]] and currently operated by [[Rapid Rail]] under the Rapid KL brand, has a total of seven stations serving central and southern Petaling Jaya, which are the {{lrts|Taman Jaya}}, {{lrts|Asia Jaya}}, {{lrts|Taman Paramount}}, {{lrts|Taman Bahagia}}, {{lrts|Kelana Jaya}}, {{lrts|Lembah Subang}} and {{lrts|Ara Damansara}} stations.

The newly constructed {{rint|my|9}} [[MRT Kajang Line]] and {{rint|my|12}} [[MRT Putrajaya Line]], which opened in 2017 and 2022 respectively, serve the northern part of Petaling Jaya's municipal area, also known as Damansara. The lines call at {{mrts|Kota Damansara}}, {{mrts|Surian}}, {{mrts|Mutiara Damansara}} and {{mrts|Bandar Utama}} on the Kajang Line, and the {{mrts|Damansara Damai}}, {{mrts|Sri Damansara Barat}}, {{mrts|Sri Damansara Sentral}} and {{mrts|Sri Damansara Timur}} stations on the Putrajaya Line.

In the future, the upcoming {{rint|my|11}} [[LRT Shah Alam Line]], will serve twenty-six stations in central and western Petaling Jaya starting from Bandar Utama, Glenmarie 2, SS7 to Johan Setia. The railway line set to open in 2025.

The {{rint|my|2}} [[Tanjung Malim-Port Klang Line]], a [[commuter rail]] service operated by [[KTM Komuter]], mainly serves southern Petaling Jaya via {{kstn|Petaling}}, {{kstn|Jalan Templer}}, {{kstn|Kampung Dato Harun}}, {{kstn|Seri Setia}} and {{kstn|Setia Jaya}} stations. At the Setia Jaya, the KTM Komuter line is connected to the {{rint|my|21}} [[BRT Sunway Line]]. ({{stn|Sunway-Setia Jaya}} station).

Despite their names, the {{stn|Sungai Buloh}} and {{stn|Kepong Sentral}} stations are both located within the Petaling Jaya City Council's jurisdiction, and as such, are part of the Petaling Jaya city proper. These stations are both served by the {{rint|my|2}} [[Tanjung Malim-Port Klang Line]], as well as the {{rint|my|ets}} [[KTM ETS]], an inter-city rail service providing services to [[Padang Besar, Malaysia|Padang Besar]], [[Butterworth, Seberang Perai|Butterworth]], [[Ipoh]] and [[Gemas]]. The {{rint|my|12}} [[MRT Putrajaya Line]] also calls at Sungai Buloh station.

===Expressways===
Petaling Jaya has three access points to the national highway system: {{MES-E|1}} via [[Kota Damansara]], [[Damansara, Selangor|Damansara]], and [[Subang, Selangor|Subang]]. Internally, highways such as the {{MES-E|11}}, {{MES-E|23}} and the {{JKR|2}} [[Federal Highway, Malaysia|Federal Highway]] exist and also known for traffic jams.
