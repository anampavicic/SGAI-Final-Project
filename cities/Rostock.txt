'''Rostock''' ({{IPA|de|ˈʁɔstɔk|lang|De-Rostock.ogg}}; [[Polabian language|Polabian]]: ''Roztoc''), officially the '''[[Hanseatic]] and University City of Rostock''' ({{langx|de|link=no|Hanse- und Universitätsstadt Rostock}}), is the largest city in the German [[States of Germany|state]] of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] and lies in the [[Mecklenburg]]ian part of the state, close to the border with [[Pomerania]].{{efn|Closest border point with Pomerania from Rostock in [[Ribnitz-Damgarten]] between Ribnitz (Mecklenburg) and Damgarten (Pomerania). Border constituted by [[River Recknitz]].}} With around 210,000 inhabitants, it is the third-largest city on the German [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] coast after [[Kiel]] and [[Lübeck]], the eighth-largest city in the area of former [[East Germany]], as well as the [[List of cities in Germany by population|39th-largest city]] of Germany. Rostock was the largest coastal and most important port city in East Germany.

Rostock stands on the estuary of the [[Warnow|River Warnow]] into the [[Bay of Mecklenburg]] of the Baltic Sea. The city stretches for about {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=on}} along the river. The river flows into the sea in the very north of the city, between the boroughs of [[Warnemünde]] and Hohe Düne. The city center lies further upstream, in the very south of the city. Most of Rostock's inhabitants live on the western side of the Warnow; the area east of the river is dominated by the port, industrial estates, and the forested [[Rostock Heath]]. The city's coastline east and west of the river mouth is relatively undeveloped, with long sandy beaches prevailing. The name of the city is of [[Polabian Slavs|Slavic]] origin.

Rostock is the economic center of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and the state's only [[regiopolis]] (a city outside the core of a metropolitan area). The port of Rostock is the fourth largest port in Germany after the [[North Sea]] ports of [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]]/[[Bremerhaven]], and [[Wilhelmshaven]], and the largest port on the German Baltic coast. The ferry routes between Rostock to [[Gedser]] in Denmark and to [[Trelleborg]] in Southern Sweden are among the busiest between Germany and [[Scandinavia]]. [[Rostock–Laage Airport]] lies in a [[Rostock (district)|rural region]] [[Laage|southeast of the city]].

The city is home to the oldest university in the [[Baltic region]] and one of the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest universities in the world]], the [[University of Rostock]], founded in 1419. The university's hospital, ''Universitätsmedizin Rostock'', is one of two university hospitals in the state, along with [[Greifswald University Hospital|''Universitätsmedizin Greifswald'']] of the [[University of Greifswald]] in [[Western Pomerania]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date = June 2022}}
{{see also|Timeline of Rostock}}

===Early history===

In the 11th century [[Polabian Slavs]] founded a settlement at the Warnow river called ''Roztoc'' (*''ras-tokŭ'', Slavic for "fork of a river"); the name Rostock is derived from that designation.

The Danish king [[Valdemar I of Denmark|Valdemar I]] set the town on fire in 1161. Afterwards the place was settled by German traders. Initially there were three separate cities:
* ''Altstadt'' (Old Town) around the ''Alter Markt'' (Old Market), which had [[St. Petrikirche, Rostock|St. Petri]] (St. Peter's Church),
* ''Mittelstadt'' (Middle Town) around the ''Neuer Markt'' (New Market), with St. Marien ([[St. Mary's Church, Rostock|St. Mary's Church]]) and
[[File:Rostocker Stadtbestätigung 1213.png|thumb|left|upright=0.8|Confirmation of [[Lübeck law]] city rights, 1218]]
* ''Neustadt'' (New Town) around the ''Hopfenmarkt'' (Hop Market, now University Square), with St. Jakobi (St. James's Church, demolished after World War II).

In 1218, Rostock was granted [[Lübeck law]] city rights by [[Henry Borwin I, Lord of Mecklenburg|Heinrich Borwin]], prince of Mecklenburg.

===Hanseatic League===
[[File:Rostock asv2018-05 img29 University.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Rostock|Rostock University]], the oldest university in continental northern Europe and the [[Baltic Sea]] area, founded in 1419]]
During the [[first partition of Mecklenburg]] following the death of [[Henry Borwin II, Lord of Mecklenburg|Henry Borwin II of Mecklenburg]] in 1226, Rostock became the seat of the [[Lordship of Rostock]], which survived for almost a century. In 1251, the city became a member of the [[Hanseatic League]]. In the 14th century it was a powerful seaport town with 12,000 inhabitants and the largest city in [[Mecklenburg]]. [[Cog (ship)|Ships]] for cruising the [[Baltic Sea]] were constructed in Rostock. The formerly independent fishing village of [[Warnemünde]] at the Baltic Sea became a part of Rostock in 1323, to secure the city's access to the sea.

In 1419, the [[University of Rostock]] was founded, the oldest university in continental northern Europe and the [[Baltic Sea]] area.

===15th to 18th centuries===
[[File:Rostock 1550-60.jpg|thumb|left|Rostock in the 16th century]]
[[File:Rostock um 1650.jpg|thumb|left|Rostock in the 17th century]]
At the end of the 15th century, the dukes of [[Duchy of Mecklenburg|Mecklenburg]] succeeded in enforcing their rule over the town of Rostock, which had until then been only nominally subject to their rule and essentially independent. They took advantage of a riot known as ''Domfehde'', a failed uprising of the [[poverty|impoverished]] population. Subsequent quarrels with the dukes and persistent plundering led ultimately to a loss of the city's economic and political power.
[[File:Plan von Rostock gez 1780-1790 J.M. von Tarnows.jpg|thumb|right|Rostock 1780–90]]

In 1565 there were further clashes with Schwerin that had far-reaching consequences. Among other things, the nobility introduced a beer [[excise]] that favoured the dukes. [[John Albert I, Duke of Mecklenburg|John Albert I]] advanced on the city with 500 horsemen, after Rostock had refused to take the formal oath of allegiance, and had the city wall razed (slighted) to have a fortress built. The conflict did not end until the first [[Rostock Inheritance Agreement]] of 21 September 1573, in which the state princes were guaranteed hereditary rule over the city for centuries and recognizing them as the supreme judicial authority; this bound Rostock for a long time. The citizens razed (or slighted) the fortress the following spring.

From 1575 to 1577 the city walls were rebuilt, as was the ''Lagebusch'' tower and the ''Stein'' Gate, in the Dutch Renaissance style. The inscription ''sit intra te concordia et publica felicitas'' ("Let there be harmony and public happiness within you"), can still be read on the gate, and refers directly to the conflict with the Duke. In 1584 the Second Rostock Inheritance Agreement was enforced, which resulted in a further loss of former city tax privileges. At the same time, these inheritance contracts put paid to Rostock's ambition of achieving [[imperial immediacy]], as [[Lübeck]] had done in 1226.

The strategic location of Rostock provoked the envy of its rivals. [[Denmark|Danes]] and Swedes occupied the city twice, first during the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–48) and again from 1700 to 1721. Later in the early 19th century, the [[First French Empire|French]], under [[Napoleon]], occupied the town for about a decade until 1813. In nearby [[Lübeck]]-[[Ratekau]], [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]], who was born in Rostock and who was one of few generals to fight on after defeat at the [[Battle of Jena]], surrendered to the French in 1806. This was only after furious street fighting in the [[Battle of Lübeck]], in which he led some of the [[cavalry charge]]s himself. By the time of the surrender, the exhausted [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]ns had neither food nor ammunition.

===19th century===
[[File:Rostock asv2018-05 img38 NeuerMarkt.jpg|thumb|right|Colourful gabled houses of Rostock]]
In the first half of the 19th century, Rostock regained much of its economic importance, due at first to the wheat trade, then, from the 1850s, to industry, especially its shipyards. The first propeller-driven steamers in Germany were constructed here.

The city grew in area and population, with new quarters developing in the south and west of the ancient borders of the city. Two notable developments were added to house the increasing population at around 1900:
* ''Steintor-Vorstadt'' in the south, stretching from the old city wall to the facilities of the new ''Lloydbahnhof'' (Lloyd Railway Station, now [[Rostock Hauptbahnhof]]), was designed as a living quarter. It consisted mostly of large single houses, once inhabited by wealthy citizens.
* ''Kröpeliner-Tor-Vorstadt'' in the west, was designed to house the working population as well as to provide smaller and larger industrial facilities, such as the Mahn & Ohlerich's Brewery (now Hanseatische Brauerei Rostock). The main shipyard, ''Neptun'', was nearby at the shore of the river.

===20th century===
In the 20th century, important aircraft manufacturing facilities were situated in the city, such as the [[Arado Flugzeugwerke]] in [[Warnemünde]] and the [[Heinkel]] Works with facilities at various places, including their secondary [[Vienna International Airport|''Heinkel-Süd'' facility in Schwechat, Austria]], as the original Heinkel firm's Rostock facilities had been renamed ''Heinkel-Nord''. The world's first [[Heinkel He 178|airworthy jet plane prototype]] made its test flights at their facilities in what used to be named the ''Rostock''-{{ill|Marienehe|lt=''Marienehe''|de}} neighborhood (today's ''Rostock''-[[:de:Schmarl|''Schmarl'']] community, along the west bank of the [[Unterwarnow]] estuary).

In the early 1930s, the Nazi Party gained in popularity among Rostock's voters, many of whom had suffered economic hardship during the 1920s. In [[German federal election, July 1932|elections]] in the summer of 1932, when the Nazis achieved 37.3 percent, their greatest national showing in a free election, they polled 40.3 percent in Rostock. A year later, after the [[Nazi seizure of power]] and the suppression of other political parties, the Rostock city council (''Stadtrat'') was composed entirely of Nazis. During ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' on 10 November 1938, the synagogue in Rostock's Augustenstrasse was destroyed by arson and dozens of Jews were beaten and imprisoned.

Feverish rearmament by the Nazi regime boosted Rostock's industrial importance in the late 1930s, and employment soared at the [[Heinkel]] and [[Arado Flugzeugwerke|Arado]] factories, and at the Neptunwerft shipyard. The city's population grew from 100,000 in 1935 to 121,192 in 1939.

{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}During [[World War II]], Rostock was subjected to repeated and increasingly heavy bombing attacks, especially by the British [[Royal Air Force]]. Targets included the Heinkel and Arado plants and the shipyard, but churches and other historic structures in the city centre were also heavily damaged, among them the 14th-century Nikolaikirche (St Nicholas Church) and Jakobikirche (St Jacob's Church). The ruins of the latter were pulled down in 1960.

The city was eventually captured by the Soviet [[2nd Belorussian Front]] on 2 May 1945 during the [[Battle of the Oder–Neisse|Stettin-Rostock offensive operation]].

After the war, Rostock – now in the [[German Democratic Republic]] – became East Germany's largest seaport. The state expanded the national shipyards in the district of [[Warnemünde]]. The city's population, boosted in part by resettled ethnic German refugees who had been expelled from territories in the east, increased in the GDR years to a peak of 260,000. Following the [[German reunification|reunification]] of Germany in 1990, Rostock lost its privileged position as the No. 1 port of the GDR, and the city's population declined to about 200,000. However, after 2006, the population increased again. Today, Rostock and Warnemünde are significant tourist destinations on the Baltic Sea.

Since the late 20th century migrants have come to Germany from Turkey and Africa seeking work. In response to high rates of joblessness and increased levels of crime, some Germans took part in the [[Rostock-Lichtenhagen riots]] which occurred from 22 to 24 August 1992.

Rostock has a population of about 210,000 people and is the largest city in [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] state. Rostock became a member of [[Hanseatic League]] in 15th century, which made Rostock a larger city. Rostock reached its peak of over 100,000 in 1935. In the [[East Germany]] era, Rostock was the largest and most important port of East Germany where many sailors and boatmen moved to this city. It also brought many harbour and other industiries to Rostock. Rostock reached its historical peak of population in 1988 with population of about 254,000. After the [[German Reunification]], population Rostock decline due to many people who moved to former West Germany. Since 2003, Rostock's population starts to grow again due to students and new companies.

Rostock has had three different coats of arms, known as the ''Signum'', the ''Secretum'' and the ''Sigillum''. The Signum, which can be traced back to 1367, was developed last and is to this day the coat of arms of the city.

The Signum depicts a golden [[griffin]] on a blue background, with bars of silver and red, the colours of the [[Hanseatic League]], below. It can be seen not only on flags and houses, and at bus stops, but also on bridges, gullies, fences, ships and restaurants.

===Administration===
[[File:Rostock asv2018-05 img37 NeuerMarkt.jpg|thumb|Restored Rostock City Hall, a mixture of Baroque and [[Brick Gothic]] architecture]]
Since the 13th century, the governing body of the city has been the city council (''Rat''), first consisting of ten, later of 24 elected [[alderman|aldermen]] (''Ratsherren''). The chairman of the city council was the city mayor. In the 19th century there were three mayors. Since 1925, the head of the city has borne the title of [[Mayor]]. Having been elected by the city council for centuries, since 2002 this position is now elected directly by the citizens of Rostock, following a reform. If a candidate does not achieve an absolute majority in the first round, the two candidates with the most votes stand in a second round.

[[File:Regiopole Rostock Verflechtungen.jpg|thumb|upright|Geographical position of the Rostock [[Regiopolis]]]]

===Regiopolis Rostock===
Rostock is the first city region that defines itself not only as a city in its boundaries, but as a [[regiopolis]], with a supra-regional sphere of influence. A regiopolis can be compared to a [[metropolis]], but on a smaller scale. This is a sign for the inter-regional cooperation and economic dynamics that can be found in the Rostock area. A taskforce with different actors such as the hanseatic city of Rostock, the administrative [[Rostock (district)|district of Rostock]], the ''Regional Planning Association Middle Mecklenburg/Rostock'' and the local business organisations are working on the promotion and advancement of the concept.<ref>[http://www.regiopole-rostock.de/ Regiopole Rostock] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426204809/http://www.regiopole-rostock.de/ |date=26 April 2014 }} (German)</ref>

==Geography==
===Geographic location===
Rostock is located nearly centrally on [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]'s [[Baltic Sea]] coast. The city is crossed by the [[Warnow]].

The seaside part of Rostock, Rostock-[[Warnemünde]], is about {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=on}} to the north of the historic city centre. The west and the southeast are the most densely populated parts of town. The overseas port is to the east of Rostock. Rostock stretches {{convert|21.6|km|1|abbr=on}} from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the south and {{convert|19.4|km|1|abbr=on}} from east to west.

===Climate===
Rostock has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''; [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dobk'') with strong influence of the [[Baltic Sea]], more similar to [[Denmark]] and far southern [[Sweden]] than to the rest of Germany. The main difference with lower Scandinavia is that the continuous landmass to the south and east enables stronger bursts of heat during summer. In spite of this, the [[Warnemünde]] station is generally less warm on the average summer day than on the northern side of the sea. In addition, the maritime influence of the Baltic Sea tempers any Arctic blasts, ensuring slightly milder winters. The Warnemünde station is located on the open sea and thus has a stronger maritime influence and slightly smaller variations than the downtown that is further inland.

The Rostock weather station has recorded the following extreme values:<ref name=sklima/>
* Its highest temperature was {{convert|38.4|C|F}} on [[2022_European_heatwaves#July_heatwave_2|20 July 2022]].
* Its lowest temperature was {{convert|-18.4|C|F}} on 16 February 1956.
* Its greatest annual precipitation was {{convert|954.6|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 2011.
* Its least annual precipitation was {{convert|427.1|mm|in|abbr=on}} in 1976.
* The longest annual sunshine was 2,190 hours in 2018.
* The shortest annual sunshine was 1,456.6 hours in 1998.

One of the most picturesque places in Rostock is the ''Neuer Markt'' (New Market Square), with the Town Hall – that was originally built in the 13th century in [[Brick Gothic]] style, but extensively transformed in the 18th century, with the addition of a [[Baroque]] façade and a banqueting hall. The square also preserved six original, carefully restored gable houses from the 15th and 16th centuries. The other historical houses in Hanseatic style that once bordered the square were destroyed in an Allied air-raid in 1942, and rebuilt in a simplified manner.<ref>Bomben auf Rostock; H.-W. Bohl, B. Keipke, k. Schröder; Konrad Reich Verlag 1995</ref>

The 15th-century ''Kerkhofhaus'' (at Große Wasserstraße, behind the Town Hall) is considered the best-preserved brick Gothic house in Rostock. {{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

[[St. Mary's Church, Rostock|St. Mary's Church]] ''Marienkirche'', on Ziegenmarkt, is an imposing [[Brick Gothic]] church. Built in the 13th century, it was enlarged and modified at the end of the 14th century into the present cross-shaped basilica. The huge tower was not completed until the end of the 18th century. Inside there is an [[astronomical clock]] erected in 1472 by Hans Düringer.

[[File:Rostock Kröpeliner Straße.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|left|''Kröpeliner Straße'' – main shopping street]]
The main pedestrian precinct is ''Kröpeliner Straße'', which runs east from the Neuer Markt to the 14th-century ''Kröpeliner Tor'', a former town gate. The main buildings of [[University of Rostock|Rostock University]] lie at Universitätsplatz, near the middle of the street, in front of the lively fountain of ''zest for life (Brunnen der Lebensfreude)'', known colloquially as Pornobrunn (fountain of pornography), for its nude sculptures.

The ''Kloster St Katharinen'' (Convent of St. Catherine), is an old [[Franciscan]] [[monastery]] founded in 1243, and extended several times during the 14th and 15th centuries. Now used as the seat of the Academy of Music and Theatre (HMT-Rostock).

The Brick Gothic ''Nikolaikirche'' (St. Nicholas Church), which is the oldest church in Rostock, was built in the mid-13th century. Heavily damaged during [[World War II]] and subsequently restored, the building is now used as an exhibition centre and concert hall, due to its outstanding acoustics.

Some parts of the medieval [[city wall]], with four [[city gate]]s, have survived to the present day. The city has a large population of herring gulls that squawk loudly most days throughout the year.

===Warnemünde===
