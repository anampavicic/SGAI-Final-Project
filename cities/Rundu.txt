==Geography==
===Localities===
Many of Rundu's residents live in [[shack]]s. In 2020 the town had a total of 18,219 of these informal housing structures, accommodating more than 76,000 inhabitants,<ref>{{cite news | title=Namibia's ghetto life: Half million live in shacks countrywide | last=Nghinomenwa | first=Erastus | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=12 August 2020 | page=1 | url=https://www.namibian.com.na/93627/read/Namibias-ghetto-life-Half-million-live-in-shacks-countrywide}}</ref> more than the most recent (2011) census reported as total population figure.

The oldest houses in Rundu are located in the Katutura area. These houses are mainly two bedroom homes with large backyards even though they are situated next to the central business district.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}}

On the west is Tutungeni, which means "let's build". This area was previously occupied by executives of the white-dominated businessplace, but now it is open for any willing buyer in need of a quiet neighbourhood. On the East is Safari. There are the middle-priced houses built in the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2023}}

These three main localities dominated Rundu residential life until the turn of the millennium in 2000, when new housing projects by O'B Davids Properties built a new residential area called Millennium Park. After which two others have been built by the NHE, Queens and Kings Parks respectively. Recently a new formal location was added called Rainbow{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Outside the formal suburbs, shanty towns symbolise the rapid urbanisation of the town and high unemployment rates. Kehemu (Ghetto), Kaisosi (also known by the locals as Cali), Sauyemwa (SA), and Ndama are the most informal areas while a fourth, Donkerhoek (Dark Corner), is rapidly becoming formal since the start of the Build Together Campaign in 1992.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
