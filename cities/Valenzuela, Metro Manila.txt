'''Valenzuela''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|v|æ|l|ən|zj|u|ˈ|ɛ|l|ə}}, [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: {{IPA|tl|valensˈwela|}}), officially the '''City of Valenzuela''' ({{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Valenzuela}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 714,978 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is the [[Metro Manila|6th]] most populous city in the National Capital Region, and the [[List of cities in the Philippines|11th]] most populous in the country. It is located about {{convert|14|km|sp=us}} north of [[Manila]], the nation's capital. Valenzuela is categorized under Republic Act Nos. 7160 and 8526 as a highly urbanized, first-class city based on income classification and number of population.<ref name="RA8526"/><ref>{{Cite news|title=Valenzuela celebrates 13th cityhood anniversary on Monday|url=http://bayanihan.org/2011/02/14/metro-news-valenzuela-celebrates-13th-cityhood-anniversary-on-monday/|access-date=April 23, 2011|newspaper=Bayanihan.org|date=February 14, 2011|archive-date=August 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812075919/http://bayanihan.org/2011/02/14/metro-news-valenzuela-celebrates-13th-cityhood-anniversary-on-monday/|url-status=dead}}</ref> A landlocked [[Cities of the Philippines|chartered city]] located on the island of [[Luzon Island|Luzon]], it is bordered by the province of [[Bulacan]], and cities of [[Caloocan]], [[Malabon]] and [[Quezon City]]. Valenzuela shares border and access to [[Tullahan River|Tenejeros-Tullahan River]] with Malabon. It has a total land area of {{convert|45.75|sqkm|sp=us}}, where its residents are composed of about 72% [[Tagalog people]] followed by 5% [[Bicolano people|Bicolano]]s with a small percentage of foreign nationals.

Valenzuela was named after [[Pío Valenzuela]], a physician and a member of the [[Katipunan]], a secret society founded against the colonial government of Spain. The city, as a town, originally had the name '''Polo''', initially formed in 1621 after separation from [[Meycauayan]], Bulacan. The [[Campaigns of the Philippine–American War#Significant battles: Malolos campaign|Battle of Malinta]] of the [[Philippine–American War]] was fought in Polo in 1899. In 1960, President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] ordered the split of Polo's southern [[barangay]]s to form another town named as ''Valenzuela''. The split was revoked by President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] in 1963 after political disagreements and the new merged town was named Valenzuela. The modern-day Valenzuela with its borders was chartered in 1998.

==Toponymy==
In [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''Valenzuela'' is a [[diminutive form]] of [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] which means "little Valencia".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hanks|first=Patrick|title=Dictionary of American Family Names|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0-19-508137-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K18RAQAAMAAJ|edition=e-reference|access-date=April 26, 2011}} {{ISBN|978-0-19-508137-4}}. Alternative URL can be found in [http://www.ancestry.com/facts/Valenzuela-name-meaning.ashx Ancestry.com]</ref> The name ''Valenzuela'' is also the surname of [[Pío Valenzuela|Pío Valenzuela y Alejandrino]], a Tagalog physician and was one of the leaders of [[Katipunan]]. He was regarded as a member of the Katipunan triumvirate which started the [[Philippine Revolution]] against Spanish colonial authorities in 1896. He also served as the provisional chairman for the Katipunan.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://valenzuelausa.org/piovalenzuela.aspx|archive-url=https://archive.today/20090219151954/http://valenzuelausa.org/piovalenzuela.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 19, 2009|title=Dr. Pio Valenzuela, 1869–1956|access-date=September 21, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Alvarez|Carolina|Malay|1992|p=6}}</ref>

Before 1960, Valenzuela was formerly known as Polo, where Pío Valenzuela was born.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=33}}</ref> The name ''Polo'' was derived from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] term ''pulô'', which means "island" or "islet", although the area was not an island itself. The town of Polo was entirely surrounded by the rivers, thus, creating an impression of itself being an island.<ref>{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=34}}</ref>

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
During the [[History of the Philippines (1565–1898)|Spanish era]], present-day Valenzuela, [[Obando, Bulacan|Obando]] and [[Novaliches]] (now in [[Quezon City]]) were parts of [[Bulacan]]. Areas now covered by Valenzuela included four [[hacienda]]s (Malinta, Tala, Piedad, and Maysilo), small political settlements and a Spanish garrison.<ref name="arenas36">{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=36}}</ref> These areas were known as ''Polo''. The region was bounded by the Tullahan River on the south and streams of branching [[Pampanga River|Río Grande de Pampanga]] on some areas.

When Manila became an archdiocese in 1595, regular friars who had already established permanent churches in [[Meycauayan, Bulacan|Meycauayan]] decided that the ''[[sitio]]'' of Polo be separated from the town and have its own church to cater its increasing spiritual needs. Through successive efforts of [[Franciscan Order|Franciscan]] friar Juan Taranco and Don Juan Monsód, ''sitio'' Polo and Catanghalan ''(now part of Obando)'' was successfully separated from Meycauayan on November 7, 1621, at the feast day of the town's new patron, [[San Diego de Alcala|St. Didacus of Alcalá]], known locally as ''San Diego de Alcalá.''<ref name="ord3">{{Cite web|url=http://www.valenzuela.gov.ph/ckuploads/images/ORD_%202010-03%20p_1.jpg|title=City Ordinance 03: An Ordinance Declaring November 7 and Years Thereafter as Valenzuela Foundation Day|publisher=Valenzuela City Council|access-date=April 19, 2011}}</ref> The first ''[[Cabeza de Barangay|cabeza de barangay]]'' of Polo was Monsód, while Taranco run the parish on a small tavern, which would become the present-day San Diego de Alcalá church.<ref name="arenas39">{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=39}}</ref> The separation was then confirmed by [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] [[Alonso Fajardo de Entenza]] in a proclamation letter on November 12, 1623.

The construction of a parochial church dedicated to St. [[Didacus of Alcalá]] started in 1627, under the supervision of José Valencia and Juan Tibay. The first church structure was completed in 1632. But its bell was looted during the Chinese uprising of 1635. At that time, Chinese merchants resided specifically in [[Pariancillo Villa|Barrio Pariancillo]], which was located at the back of the church. In 1852, the church was repaired and remodeled under the direction of Fr. Vicente. The church was later re-dedicated to another patron, to the ''[[Immaculate Conception|Nuestra señora de la Inmaculada Concepción]].'' A convent was also built followed by a common house (''casa tribunal'') that had a rectangular prison cell and a school house made of stone.<ref name="arenas42">{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=42}}</ref> On June 3, 1865, a strong earthquake destroyed the belfry of the [[San Diego de Alcala Church|San Diego de Alcalá Church]], followed by an epidemic that killed thousands of people.<ref name="arenas47">{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=47}}</ref>

A new pueblo was carved out of the northwestern area of Polo on May 14, 1753, by the orders of the Governor-General [[Francisco José de Ovando, 1st Marquis of Brindisi|Francisco Jose de Obando y Solis, Marquis of Brindisi]]. The new town was named [[Obando, Bulacan|Obando]] in honor of the governor general, and was incorporated to Bulacan.<ref name="arenas42"/>

In [[Seven Years' War|1762-1764]] [[British occupation of Manila]] and surrounding suburbs the colonial government led by [[Simón de Anda y Salazar]] fled to [[Bacolor, Pampanga]] through Polo. The British followed Anda, and at one point stayed in sitio Mabolo while waiting for orders from the British civil Governor [[Dawsonne Drake]]. They explored the nearby communities of Malanday, Wakas, Dalandanan, Pasolo, Rincon and Malinta. The terrified local population fled and sought refuge in the forests of Viente Reales, where many of them died of [[malaria]].<ref name="arenas46">{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=46}}</ref> The British then proceed to [[Malolos, Bulacan]] where they were ambushed by the stationed Spanish soldiers. After the chase, the local population of Polo returned to their homes on May 12, 1763, after days of reconstruction. The day May 12 was commemorated as the feast of [[Saint Roch|St. Roch]], locally known as ''San Roque'', as another patron saint and as a memorial to those who died in the Seven Years' War.<ref name="arenas46"/>

In 1854, General Manuel Pavía y Lacy, Marquis de Novaliches, was named Governor-General of the Philippine Islands. He arrived in Manila with the task of establishing a penal colony where prisoners would be granted lands they would develop in exchange for their release. The colony was given the name Hacienda Tala since the once heavily forested area became identical to one where a star (“tala”) had fallen after clearing. This hacienda grew into a larger community that eventually merged with the haciendas of Malinta and Piedad in forming the independent town of [[Novaliches]] on January 26, 1856.<ref>[https://novalichesdiocese.org/spanish-era/ Diocese of Novaliches]</ref> A new road from Polo to Novaliches opened and traversed the barrios of Mabolo, Pasolo, Rincon, Malinta, Masisan, Paso de Blas, Canumay and Bagbaguin.

In 1869, Filipino physician and patriot [[Pío Valenzuela]] was born in Polo. He would be later known as one of the key leaders of the [[Katipunan]], which he joined in 1892 at the age of 23. His admission to the society led to the more recruits from Polo, including Ulpiano Fernández, Gregorio Flamenco, Crispiniano Agustines, and Faustino Duque. When Valenzuela was the chief editor, Fernández held a special role in the Katipunan as a printer of the ''[[Ang Kalayaan]],'' the organization's official newspaper.<ref name="arenas48">{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=48}}</ref>

The now-defunct [[Philippine National Railways|Manila-Dagupan Railway]] opened in 1892 and traversed the barrios of Marulas, Caruhatan, Malinta, Dalandanan and Malanday, with the station being in [[Dalandanan, Valenzuela|Dalandanan]].<ref>https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10215303585008491&id=1401141105 {{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref>

The Americans imposed a military government when they acquire the Philippine islands from Spain as part of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|peace treaty]] of the [[Spanish–American War]]. They appointed Pío Valenzuela as the first municipal president of (''presidente municipal'') on September 6, 1899, to suppress aggressive leadership in the area. He resigned in February 1901 to become the head of the military division and an election was held. Later that year, the government proclaimed Rufino Valenzuela, a relative of Pío as the second president and first elected municipal president of the town.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bulacan.gov.ph/generalinfo/governor.php?id=38 | title=Pio Valenzuela (1921-1925) | work=Province of Bulacan, Republic of the Philippines | access-date=May 28, 2016 | archive-date=April 25, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170425171726/http://www.bulacan.gov.ph/generalinfo/governor.php?id=38 | url-status=dead }}</ref>

When the [[Philippine–American War]] broke out in early 1899, the Americans were directed to capture [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] who was escaping to [[Malolos, Bulacan]].

In 1910, a stone arch was built at its municipal boundary with [[Malabon]], [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] along Calle Real (modern-day Marcelo H. Del Pilar Street). In 1928, [[MacArthur Highway|Manila North Road]] (Highway 3) opened and became the new gateway. The once-agricultural town slowly shifted to industrial. Businesses soon put up factories, the most famous of which is the Japanese venture Balintawak Beer Brewery that opened in 1938.

===Japanese occupation era===
The [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|entrance of the Japanese]] in Polo during the [[Second World War]] was met with almost no resistance. However, there were too many murders committed. The place became a center of ''[[Makapili]]'' and spies who troubled the peaceful civilians. It was found that the Balintawak Beer Brewery became front for manufacturing ammunition for the Japanese forces. The sudden appearance of the Japanese added terror to the place. The old church of San Diego de Alcalá became a torture house during WWII.

The reign of terror climaxed on December 10, 1944. It was a day of mourning for the people of Polo and Obando when the Japanese massacred more than a hundred males in both towns. About 1:00&nbsp;am on this day up to the setting of the sun cries could be heard from the municipal building when males were tortured to death. Mayor Feliciano Ponciano met the same fate when he died on a cruel death together with other municipal officials.<ref name="arenas52">{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=52}}</ref>

When [[Philippines Campaign (1944–45)|liberation came]], the town was partly burned by the approaching the military forces of combined Filipino and American regiments who used [[flamethrower]]s. They bombed and shelled big houses in the town not exempting even the more than 300 years old church of San Diego.<ref name="arenas52" />

The historical old bridge connecting northern and southern areas of the town was destroyed by the Japanese, thus separating Polo in two parts. The northern part was at once liberated by joint Filipino and American troops while the southern part, which includes the municipal center ''poblacion'' was still under the Japanese banner. The Japanese abandoned the town on February 11, 1945, when the combined troops were able to cross the river and took the town.

===Philippine independence===
In 1947, the Balintawak Beer Brewery was acquired by [[San Miguel Beer]]. The Spanish church was never rebuilt and only the belfry and the entrance arch remained. A new church was built perpendicular to the ruins of the old one.

On July 21, 1960, President [[Carlos P. Garcia]] signed Executive Order No. 401 which divided Polo into two: Polo and Valenzuela.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=401, s. 1960|date=July 21, 1960|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1960/07/21/executive-order-no-401-s-1960/|title=Creating the municipality of Valenzuela in the province of Bulacan|accessdate=April 24, 2022|website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]|archive-date=July 10, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210710180226/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1960/07/21/executive-order-no-401-s-1960/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Polo comprised the northern barangays of Wawang Pulo, Poblacion, Palasan, Arkong Bato, Pariancillo Villa, Balangkas, Mabolo, Coloong, Malanday, Bisig, Tagalag, Rincon, Pasolo, [[Punturin, Valenzuela City|Punturin]], [[Bignay, Valenzuela City|Bignay]], Viente Reales, and Dalandanan. Valenzuela, on the other hand, comprised the southern barangays of Karuhatan, Marulas, Malinta, Ugong, Mapulang Lupa, Canumay, Maysan, Parada, Paso de Blas, Bagbaguin and Torres Bugallón (now Gen. T. de Leon). A provisional town hall was built across today’s SM City Valenzuela, until a permanent town hall was built near the intersection of MacArthur Highway and the old Polo-Novaliches Road.

The division soon proved to be detrimental to economic growth in each town, so Bulacan [[Legislative districts of Bulacan#2nd District|Second district]] Representative to the [[5th Congress of the Philippines|Fifth Congress]] Rogaciano Mercado and [[Senator of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Francisco Soc Rodrigo]] filed a bill which sought the reunification of the two towns. On September 11, 1963, President [[Diosdado Macapagal]] signed Executive Order No. 46 which reunified Valenzuela and Polo, adapting ''Valenzuela'' as the name of the resulting town.<ref name="arenas54">{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=54}}</ref>

In 1967, mayor [[Ignacio Santiago Sr.]] purchased lots in Karuhatan in which the new municipal hall would be built. Misinterpretation of property surveys and tax appropriation issues sparked the debate on which [[barangay]] should the municipal hall be belonged to: Karuhatan, Malinta, or Maysan. To resolve the issue, Santiago ordered the creation of a new barangay which was called Poblacion II, a reference to the old Poblacion barangay.<ref name="arenas56">{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=56}}</ref>

====Incorporation of Metro Manila====
On November 7, 1975, jurisdiction over Valenzuela was moved from the province of Bulacan to Metro Manila. Metro Manila was then headed by [[First Spouse of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]] as its [[Governor of Metro Manila|governor]]. Due to this, Valenzuela is the only area in the modern National Capital Region that was neither part of Spanish colonial-era [[Manila (province)|Manila]], [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] province, nor the war-time [[City of Greater Manila]].<ref name="arenas55-6">{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|pp=55–56}}</ref>

In 1968, the North Diversion Road (now [[North Luzon Expressway]]) was opened.<ref name="arenas58">{{Harvnb|Arenas|1997|p=58}}</ref> Rail transport to the city ceased in 1988 with the closure of the [[Philippine National Railway]]'s North Line.

====Cityhood====
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
The passage of the Local Government Code in 1991 provided local governments autonomy which has allowed them develop into self-reliant communities. On February 14, 1998, President [[Fidel V. Ramos]] signed Republic Act No. 8526, which converted the municipality of Valenzuela into a highly urbanized chartered city. The law also ordered the division of the newly created city into two [[Legislative districts of Valenzuela City|legislative districts]].<ref name="RA8526"/> When the law was ratified on December 30, 1998, Valenzuela became the 12th city to be admitted in Metro Manila and the 83rd [[Cities of the Philippines|in the Philippines]].<ref name="timoghilaga">{{Cite web|title=Project Study June 2009|url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/23510226/1334833239/name/THPGI.pdf|publisher=Timog Hilaga Providence Group|access-date=December 12, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130929143951/http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/23510226/1334833239/name/THPGI.pdf|archive-date=September 29, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Mahilum|first=Ed|title=Valenzuela to mark 13th year with mega jobs, trade fairs|url=http://www.mb.com.ph/node/303894/valenzuela-mark-13th-year-with-mega-job|access-date=December 11, 2011|work=Manila Bulletin|date=February 12, 2011}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Valenzuela satellite image.png|thumb|right|Satellite image of Valenzuela.]]

Increased climate variability, which is associated with global warming, has brought with it periods of heavy rainfall and high tides which in turn results in stagnant water which can stay in the area for up to 4 weeks due to insufficient drainage and improper solid waste disposal. People are often stranded inside their homes and are exposed to water-borne diseases such as [[Dengue fever|dengue]] and [[leptospirosis]]. Better early warning systems are needed to manage the risk associated with increased rainfall.<ref>[http://cdkn.org/resource/inside-story-building-resilience-climate-change-valenzuela-manila/?loclang=en_gb INSIDE STORY: Building resilience to climate change locally – The case of Valenzuela City, Metro Manila]</ref>

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|List of barangays in Valenzuela}}
[[File:Ph fil valenzuela barangays.png|thumb|Political map of Valenzuela|350px]]

Valenzuela has 33 [[barangay]]s, the smallest administrative unit in the city. The barangay is headed by the barangay captain or ''[[Punong Barangay|punong barangay]]'' and his 7-manned local council or [[Barangay Kagawad|''mga'' ''kagawad'']] duly elected by the residents. The youth sector of the barangay is represented by the youth council called the ''[[Sangguniang Kabataan]]'' (SK) headed by the SK chairperson and his 7-manned assembly, also known as ''mga SK kagawad''. There are 33 ''punong barangays'' and 231 ''kagawads'' in Valenzuela; SK officials are also of the same number. The barangays also serve as [[Census tract|census areas]] of the city.

At the national level, Valenzuela is divided into two [[congressional district]]s: the [[Legislative districts of Valenzuela#1st District|first legislative district]] in the northern half of the city, which contains 24 barangays, and the [[Legislative districts of Valenzuela#2nd District|second legislative district]] in the southern half of the city, which contains the remaining 9 barangays. Unlike barangays, the legislative districts have no political leader but are represented by congressional representatives in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]].

Due to its location in Metro Manila, the climate of Valenzuela is almost similar to the country's capital, Manila. Being on the west coast of the Philippines, the [[Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration]] (PAGASA) classifies Valenzuela as ''Type I'' under its weather scheme. Wind from the Pacific Ocean is generally blocked by the [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]] mountain range several kilometers east of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kidlat.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/cab/statfram.htm|title=Climate Information and Statistics|publisher=Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration|access-date=April 21, 2011|archive-date=May 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130525212029/http://kidlat.pagasa.dost.gov.ph/cab/statfram.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Its proximity to the equator tends to give the city a very small temperature range, from as low as {{convert|20|C|F}} to as high as {{convert|35|C|F}}, although humidity makes these hot temperatures feel much hotter. The [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate system]] classifies Valenzuela climate as a borderline [[Tropical monsoon climate|tropical monsoon (''Am'')]] and [[Tropical savanna climate|tropical savanna (''Aw'')]] due to its location and precipitation characteristics. This means the city has two pronounced seasons: dry and wet seasons.

[[Relative humidity|Humidity]] levels are usually high in the morning, especially during June–November, making it feel warmer. The lowest humidity levels are recorded in the evening during the wet season. Discomfort from heat and humidity is extreme during May and June and is higher than other places in the country. The average sunlight is highest in April at 254.25 hours and lowest in July, August and September at 113 hours.<ref name="bbcmanila">{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/weather/forecast/1523?&search=manila&itemsPerPage=10&region=world|title= Weather > Philippines > Manila |publisher= BBC Weather|access-date=April 21, 2011 }}</ref>

===Ecology===
The vegetation in Valenzuela was originally covered with grasslands suitable for agriculture. Because of the rapid development of industries and the economy, land use converts grass covers into cemented roads. However, the government made efforts to preserve vegetation, such as constructing community vegetable gardens and techno-demo farms all over the city. In 2003, these gardens numbered up to two functioning farms.<ref>{{Cite web|last=de Guzman|first=Constancio|title=Farming in the City: An Annotated Bibliography of Urban and Peri-Urban Agriculture in the Philippines with Emphasis on Metro Manila|url=http://www.cipotato.org/urbanharvest/documents/pdf/ab_manila.pdf|work=[[University of the Philippines Los Banos]]|publisher=[[International Potato Center]]|access-date=December 4, 2011|page=41|year=2005|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125211242/http://www.cipotato.org/urbanharvest/documents/pdf/ab_manila.pdf|archive-date=January 25, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Flora and fauna in Valenzuela include the common plants and animals found in [[Luzon]], such as domesticated mammals. The [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources]] Protected Areas and Wildlife Bureau declared a two-hectare mangrove/swampy area in Villa Encarnacion, [[barangay]] Malanday as an ecotourism site.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ecotourism Sites in National Capital Region|url=http://www.pawb.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=366:national-capital-region-ecotourism-site&catid=69:regions|publisher=Department of Environment and Natural Resources|access-date=December 4, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120424104526/http://www.pawb.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=366:national-capital-region-ecotourism-site&catid=69:regions|archive-date=April 24, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Every year, about 100 species of migratory birds, such as [[black-crowned night heron]]s (''Nycticorax nycticorax'') and other native birds such as [[moorhen]] (''Gallinula sp.''), [[swamphen]] (''Porphyrio sp.'') and [[Philippine duck]] (''Anas luzonica'') flock the area.

In 2007, ordinary fishing ponds in Tagalag and Coloong were transformed into fishing spots which attract anglers every year for a prize catch. Fish tournaments are held yearly to increase tourism and livelihood in the area.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Natividad|first=Beverly|title=Valenzuela offers best spots in Metro for local anglers|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/metro/view/20100109-246417/Valenzuela-offers-best-spots-in-Metro-for-local-anglers|access-date=December 4, 2011|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=January 9, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100113151610/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/metro/view/20100109-246417/Valenzuela-offers-best-spots-in-Metro-for-local-anglers|archive-date=January 13, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Local government===
{{main|Sangguniang Panglungsod}}
Like other [[cities in the Philippines]], Valenzuela is governed by a mayor and a vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The mayor is the executive head who leads the city's departments in the execution of city ordinances and delivery of public services. The vice mayor heads a legislative council that is composed of 14 members: six councilors from each of the city's two districts, and two ''[[ex officio]]'' offices held by the [[Councilor#Sangguniang Panlungsod|Association of Barangay Chairmen President]] as the [[barangay]] sector representative and the [[Sangguniang Kabataan|''Sangguniang Kabataan'' Federation President]] as youth sector representative. The council is in charge of creating the city's policies in the form of ordinances and resolutions.<ref name="RA8526">{{Cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=8526|title=An Act Converting the Municipality of Valenzuela into a Highly-Urbanized City to be Known as the City of Valenzuela|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno8526.html|access-date=April 21, 2011|website=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|date=February 14, 1998}}</ref>

In 2007, [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] signed Republic Act No. 9428 which sets February 14 every year as a special non-working holiday to commemorate cityhood of Valenzuela in 1998.<ref name="1998charter">{{Cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=9428|website=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library|title=An Act Declaring February 14 Every Year a Special Working Holiday in the City of Valenzuela to be Known as "Araw ng Lungsod ng Valenzuela"|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno9428.html|date=April 10, 2007|access-date=April 23, 2011}}</ref> On the same hand, November 12 each year is declared by the city government as the city's foundation day, looking back the establishment of then-Polo in 1623. There are misunderstandings before regarding the date of the actual foundation of the town, however, this date was decided by the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] to be the town's creation, since Spanish colonizers adopted a town's patron saint feast day as its date of creation.<ref name="nhcp valenzuela" /><ref name="ARAW NG VALENZUELA 2012 Kasaysayan, Kasarinlan, Kaunlaran" />

Each barangay in Valenzuela have their own feast. Most of them launch celebrations during May and April to honor patron saints and bounty harvest. Every April 26, a [[santacruzan]] is performed along with Santa Cruz Festival in Barangay Isla. A santacruzan is a novena procession commemorating St. Helena's mythical finding of the cross. [[Helena of Constantinople|St. Helena]] was the mother of [[Constantine the Great]]. According to legends, 300 years after the death of [[Christ]], at the age of 75, she went to Calvary to conduct a search for the Cross. After some archeological diggings at the site of the Crucifixion, she unearthed three crosses. She tested each one by making a sick servant lie on all three. The cross where the servant recovered was identified as Christ's. St. Helena's feast day falls on August 8 but the anniversary of the finding of the Cross is on May 3, in the Philippines, this celebration took the form of the [[Mexican people|Mexican]] Santa Cruz de Mayo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.travelgrove.com/travel-guides/Philippines/Valenzuela.html|title=Valenzuela Travel guide, Philippines|publisher=Travel Grove|access-date=May 12, 2009}}</ref>

The [[Valenzuela Gateway Complex Terminal]] in Paso de Blas is designated by the [[Metropolitan Manila Development Authority]] as Manila's northern provincial bus terminal. Bus companies also founded terminals in barangay Malanday, northernmost locality of Valenzuela along the border with [[Bulacan]], though there are terminals situated in barangays Dalandanan and Karuhatan as well. This includes Laguna Star Bus, PAMANA Transport Service, Inc., [[CEM Trans Services]] and Philippine Corinthian Liner, Inc. among others. These buses are lined with Metro Manila destinations only, usually in [[Alabang]] or [[Baclaran, Parañaque City|Baclaran]] with routes along [[EDSA]]. Bus traffic is also dense at barangays Paso de Blas and Bagbaguin due to its proximity to Paso de Blas Interchange and bus terminals in [[Novaliches]], [[Quezon City]]. Other modes of transportation includes [[jeepney]]s (with routes usually from Malanday to [[Recto Avenue|Recto]], [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]], [[Divisoria]], [[Port of Manila|Pier 15]] South Harbor & [[Kalaw Avenue|T. M. Kalaw]] in Manila and Grace Park & Monumento in Caloocan and Malinta to [[Malolos City]], [[Baliwag]] and [[Santa Maria, Bulacan|Santa Maria]] along MacArthur Highway) for general mass transportation, [[Auto rickshaw|tricycles]] (or ''trikes'') for small-scale transportation and [[Taxicabs of the Philippines|taxicabs]] for upper middle classes.
