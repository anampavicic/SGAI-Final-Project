It is the administrative center of the eponymous municipality and [[District of Pristina|district]].<ref name="Define Pristina"/>

In antiquity, the area of Pristina was part of the [[Dardanian Kingdom]]. The heritage of the classical era is represented by the settlement of [[Ulpiana]]. After the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into a western and an eastern half, the area remained within the [[Byzantine Empire]] between the 5th and 9th centuries. In the middle of the 9th century, it was ceded to the [[First Bulgarian Empire]], before falling again under Byzantine occupation in the early 11th century and then in the late 11th century to the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]]. The growing [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Kingdom of Serbia]] annexed the area in the 13th century and it remained under the [[Serbian Empire]] in the 14th century up to the start of the Ottoman era (1389–1455). The next centuries would be characterized by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule. During this period, Pristina developed from a village to a major urban center of the region. Following the end of the [[First Balkan War]] in 1914, it became a part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. In 1948, it was chosen as the capital of the province [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|SAP Kosovo]] under the statehood of [[Yugoslavia]]. Furthermore, Pristina would continue to serve as the capital of Kosovo after its [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|2008 independence]] from Serbia.

Pristina seems to have been a small village before the late 15th century. It is first recorded in 1342 as a village during the reign of [[Stefan Dušan]], and about a century later in 1455 at the beginning of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman era]] it had a small population of 300 households. In the following century, Pristina became an important mining and trading center due to its strategic position near the rich mining town of [[Novo Brdo]]. The city was known for its trade fairs and items, such as [[Goatskin (material)|goatskin]] and goat hair as well as gunpowder.<ref name=Warrander>{{cite book|last=Warrander|first=Gail|title=Kosovo|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides Ltd, UK|isbn=978-1-84162-331-3|pages=85–88|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uSaH1bKAb8QC|author2=Verena Knaus|year=2010}}</ref>

Pristina is the capital and the [[economic]], [[financial]], [[political]] and [[trade]] center of Kosovo, due to its location in the center of the country. It is the seat of power of the [[Government of Kosovo]], the residences for work of the [[President of Kosovo|President]] and [[Prime Minister of Kosovo]], and the [[Assembly of the Republic of Kosovo|Parliament of Kosovo]]. Pristina is also the most important transportation junction of Kosovo for [[Air transport|air]], [[Rail transport|rail]], and [[Road transport|roads]]. [[Pristina International Airport]] is the largest airport of the country and among the largest in the region. A range of expressways and motorways, such as the [[R 6 (Kosovo)|R 6]] and [[R 7 (Kosovo)|R 7]], radiate out the city and connect it to [[Albania]] and [[North Macedonia]]. Pristina will host the [[2030 Mediterranean Games]].

== Etymology ==
The origin of the name of the city is unknown. [[Eric P. Hamp]] connected the word with an Indo-European derivative ''*pṛ-tu-'' (ford) + ''*stein'' (cognate to English ''stone'') which in [[Proto-Albanian language|Proto-Albanian]], spoken in the region before the reign of Roman Emperor Trajan (1st–2nd century CE) produced ''Pristina''.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mehmeti |first1=Col |title=This Time In Linguistics History: Eric Hamp and Albanian Linguistics |url=https://www.linguisticsociety.org/content/time-linguistics-history-eric-hamp-and-albanian-linguistics |publisher=Linguistic Society of America}}</ref> Thus the name in the pre-Slavic migrations era would mean in the local Albanian variety "ford-stone" (compare [[Stanford]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Curtis |first1=Matthew |title=Slavic-Albanian Language Contact, Convergence, and Coexistence |page=42 |date=2012 |publisher=Ohio State University |isbn=978-1-2675-8033-7 |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED546136 }}</ref>

In the area of Pristina, a hilltop settlement appears since the 8th century BCE at an elevation of 685 metres near the village Teneshdoll, around 16 kilometres  north of the Pristina city center. Pottery finds suggests that the area may have been in use since the Bronze Age. The settlement seems to have maintained long-distance trade contacts as the finding of a [[skyphos]] vessel from Aegean Greece suggests.<ref>{{cite thesis|last=Alaj|first=Premtim|year=2019|title=Les habitats de l'Age du fer sur le territoire de l'actuel Kosovo |publisher=Université de Lyon|url=https://hal.inria.fr/tel-02503916/ |pages=683-690, 111-119 }}</ref>

During the [[Austro-Turkish War (1683–1699)|Austro-Turkish War]] in the late 17th century, citizens of Pristina under the leadership of the Catholic Albanian priest [[Pjetër Bogdani]] pledged loyalty to the Austrian army and supplied troops. He contributed a force of 6,000 Albanian soldiers to the Austrian army which had arrived in Pristina. According to [[Noel Malcolm]], the city in the 17th century was inhabited by a majority population of 15,000 Muslims, probably Albanian but very possibly including some Slavs.<ref name="Malcolm2020">{{cite book |last1=Malcolm |first1=Noel |title=Rebels, Believers, Survivors: Studies in the History of the Albanians |date=2020 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780198857297 |pages=133–135 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ti7wDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA133 |quote=..Prishtina, which had a mostly Muslim population of 3,000 households (roughly 15,000 people); many of these had apparently fled, but one early account states that ‘in Prishtina 5,000 Arnauts, having thrown off the Turks, and many leaders of the surrounding places...swore fealty to the Emperor.’ Who were these ‘Arnauts’? Although this word is normally treated simply as a synonym for ‘Albanians’, there are (as we shall see) some doubts as to how such apparently ‘ethnic’ labels were used by West European writers at this time. However, the fact that this writer clearly contrasts these ‘Arnauts’ in Prishtina with the people of the ‘surrounding places’ suggests that they were inhabitants of the town—in which case they were mostly Muslims, probably Albanian but very possibly including some Slavs.}}</ref> Sources from the 17th century mention the town as "situated in Albania".<ref>Jahja Drançolli (1993).

On 17 April 1941, Yugoslavia surrendered unconditionally to axis forces. On 29 June, [[Benito Mussolini]] proclaimed a greater Albania, with most of Kosovo under Italian occupation united with Albania. There ensued mass killings of Serbs, in particular colonists, and an exodus of tens of thousands of Serbs.{{sfn|Murray|1999|p=15}}<ref name="books.google.com">Sabrina P.

==== Kosovo War ====
{{Main|Kosovo War}}

[[File:089 albanian graves kosovo.jpg|thumb|right|Graves of Albanian war victims south of Pristina]]

Following the reduction of Kosovo's autonomy by former [[President of Serbia|Serbian President]] [[Slobodan Milošević]] in 1989, a harshly repressive regime was imposed throughout Kosovo by the Yugoslav government with Albanians largely being purged from state industries and institutions.<ref name="Warrander" /> The LDK's{{Clarify|date=February 2018}} role meant, that when the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] began to attack Serbian and Yugoslav forces from 1996 onwards, Pristina remained largely calm until the outbreak of the [[Kosovo War]] in March 1999. Pristina was spared large scale destruction compared to towns like [[Gjakova]] or [[Peja]] that suffered heavily at the hands of Serbian forces. For their strategic importance, however, a number of military targets were hit in Pristina during NATO's aerial campaign, including the post office, police headquarters and army barracks, today's [[Adem Jashari]] garrison on the road to [[Kosovo Polje]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

Widespread violence broke out in Pristina. Serbian and Yugoslav forces shelled several districts and, in conjunction with paramilitaries, conducted large-scale expulsions of ethnic Albanians accompanied by widespread looting and destruction of Albanian properties. Many of those expelled were directed onto trains apparently brought to Pristina's main station for the express purpose of deporting them to the border of the [[North Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], where they were forced into exile.<ref name="bbc_1999">{{cite news |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] (BBC) |title=Kosovo Albanians 'driven into history' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/310092.stm |access-date=1 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210327041339/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/310092.stm |archive-date=27 March 2021 |date=1 April 1999 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Several strategic targets in Pristina were attacked by [[NATO]] during the war, but serious physical damage appears to have largely been restricted to a few specific neighbourhoods shelled by Yugoslav security forces.

===Music===
{{further|Music composition and composers in Pristina}}

[[File:Rita_Ora_(cropped).jpg|170px|thumb|right|Singer [[Rita Ora]] was born in Pristina to [[Kosovo Albanians|Albanian]] parents ]]

[[Albanian music]] is considered to be very rich in genres and their development. But before talking about genre development, a key point that has to be mentioned is without doubt the rich [[Music of Kosovo|folklore]] of Kosovo most of which unfortunately has not been digitalized and saved in archives. The importance of folklore is reflected in two main keys, it is considered a treasure" of cultural heritage of our country and it helps to enlighten the [[Albanian history]] of that time, and the importance of that is of a high level especially when mentioning the circumstances of our territory in that time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Rudi|first=Rafet|title=Sprova Estetike - Muzika e shekullit XX (''Esthetical Challenges" - Music of the 20th Century'')|year=2002|publisher=Dukagjini|page=135}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shqiperia.com/Folklori-dhe-folkloristika.360/ |title=Portali Shqiperia}}</ref> Folklore has also served as inspiration and influence in many fields including music composition in the next generations<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gazetajnk.com/?cid=1,3,4787/|title=Gazeta Jeta në Kosovë - Kosovë - Gazeta Jeta në Kosovë|work=Gazeta Jeta në Kosovë}}</ref> One of the most notable and very first composers, [[Rexho Mulliqi]] in whose work, folklore inspiration and influence is very present.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zeri.info/artikulli/21806/rexho-mulliqi-nismetar-i-muzikes-artistike-ne-kosove|title=Zeri.info - Rexho Mulliqi- Nismëtar i muzikës artistike në Kosovë|work=zeri.info|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302174028/http://www.zeri.info/artikulli/21806/rexho-mulliqi-nismetar-i-muzikes-artistike-ne-kosove|archive-date=2014-03-02}}</ref>

When highlighting the music creativity and its starts in Kosovo and the relation between it and the music creativity in Albania even though they have had their development in different circumstances, it is proved that they share some characteristics in a very natural way. This fact shows that they belong to one "Cultural Tree".

Some of few international music artists of Albanian heritage that were born or their families were from Pristina are [[Rita Ora]], [[Dua Lipa]] and [[Era Istrefi]].
