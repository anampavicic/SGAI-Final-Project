== History ==

The city of Botucatu, herein referred as such for being the seat of an archdiocese, has experienced many changes during a century and a half of existence, the most substantial being the arrival of the state university in 1960.

The modern name Botucatu derives from the old [[Tupi language|Tupi]] name "ybytukatu" meaning "good wind", and was applied in 1720 when the land here was parceled up and granted to settlers.   Local legends survive that predate the period of structured settlement, however, relating to the time when Botucatu was the focus of a transit crossing along the route connecting the Atlantic coast with the [[Inca Empire|Peruvian lands]].

In the nineteenth century Old Botucatu was a place full of romantic characters such as coffee barons, musicians and poets and hinterland explorers. One of these is [[Manuel Ernesto da Conceição, Count of Serra Negra|Conde (count) de Serra Negra]], who is locally considered the father of [[Lawrence of Arabia]] and [[Rhett Butler]], who is said to be buried there. Of note, Botucatu's municipal council has declared war on [[Great-Britain]] on two distinct occasions, with no actual consequences.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In April 2014 opened the first mall in the city.
