'''Hamhŭng''' (''Hamhŭng-si''; {{IPA|ko|hamɣɯŋ}}) is [[North Korea]]'s [[List of cities in North Korea|second-most populous city]], and the capital of [[South Hamgyong|South Hamgyŏng]] Province. Located in the southern part of the South Hamgyong province, Hamhung is the main and most populous metropolitan area in the province. Hamhung was [[Urban planning|centrally planned]] and built by the [[government]] of North Korea.

== Administrative divisions ==
Hamhŭng is [[Administrative divisions of North Korea#Second-level divisions|divided]] into 7 ''guyŏk'' (wards):<ref>{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?ac=A0801&mc=AD0101&direct=1|access-date=2021-09-02|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

==Geography==
Hamhŭng is on the left branch of the  [[Chongchon River|Ch'ŏngch'ŏn River]], on the eastern part of the Hamhŭng plain ({{lang|ko-Hang|함흥평야}}), in South Hamgyŏng Province, northeast North Korea. Its highest point is Mount Tonghŭng, which is {{cvt|319|m}} high.

===Climate===
Hamhung has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Dwa''), with warm, humid summers, and moderately cold, dry winters. Being located by the [[Sea of Japan]], its climate is directly influenced by it, resulting in warmer winters and cooler summers than areas similar in latitude on the western coast. The longer period of warmer temperatures favors the growing of crops.<ref>{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0102&direct=1&ac=A0801|access-date=2022-02-21|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Hamhung 1958.jpg|thumb|War damaged Hamhŭng in 1958]]

[[File:Hamhung um 1958, Teilansicht der DAG-Unterkunft.jpg|thumb|The office of the ''[[German Working Group Hamhung]]'' (DAG) in 1958]]
The city was called either Hamju (as recorded in 1108, the third year of [[King Yejeong]]) or Hamjumok (as recorded in 1369, 18th year of [[King Gongmin]]). It received its current name of Hamhung in 1416, when it was promoted to a '[[Fu (administrative division)#Korea|bu]]'. The [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean word]] '흥' ([[Hanja|Hancha]]: 興), added to the original name of Hamju, means that the town would prosper.<ref>{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0101&direct=1&ac=A0801|access-date=2022-02-21|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref>

[[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seong-gye]], founder of the [[House of Yi|Yi dynasty]], retired to the city after a successful palace coup by his son [[Taejong of Joseon|Yi Bang-won]] in 1400. Though his son sent envoys to reconcile, his father had them killed. A modern Korean expression, 'King's envoy to Hamhŭng' ({{Korean|hangul=함흥차사|hanja=咸興差使|rr=Hamheungchasa|mr=hamhŭngchasa}}), refers to a person who goes on a journey and is never heard from again.<ref>{{cite book|title=How Koreans Talk|year=2002|publisher=UnhengNamu|isbn=89-87976-95-5|pages=094–095|chapter=Characters}}</ref> It was known as ''Kankō'' during [[Japanese rule of Korea]] between 1910 and 1945. It was liberated by the [[Red Army]] on 22 August 1945.

The city was 80–90% destroyed by American air raids during the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953) and was occupied by [[South Korea|ROK]] troops between 17 October 1950 and 17 December 1950. From 1955 to 1962, Hamhŭng was the object of a large-scale program of reconstruction and development by [[East Germany]] including the build-up of construction-related industries and intense training measures for Korean construction workers, engineers, city planners and architects. When the [[Bauhaus]] trained architect [[Konrad Püschel]], the first Head of City Planning for the reconstruction project arrived in 1955, he was accompanied by about 175 members of the ''Deutsche Arbeitsgruppe (DAG)'' or [[German Working Group Hamhung]] as the project team was called.<ref name=dong>Dong-Sam Sin (2016) [http://edoc.sub.uni-hamburg.de/hcu/volltexte/2017/346/pdf/Dissertation_Sin_27.02.17_ultimate.pdf Die Planung des Wiederaufbaus der Städte Hamhung und Hungnam in Nordkorea durch die DAG-Städtebaubrigade der DDR von 1955 - 1962]. A dissertation for [[HafenCity University Hamburg|HafenCity Universität Hamburg]]</ref>
The project ended two years earlier than scheduled and with a low profile because of the [[Sino-Soviet split|Sino-Soviet conflict]] and the opposing positions that North Korea and East Germany took on that issue.<ref>For more information on the post-War reconstruction project, see {{cite book |last=Frank |first=Rüdiger |title=Die DDR und Nordkorea. Der Wiederaufbau der Stadt Hamhŭng von 1954–1962 |date=December 1996|publisher=Shaker |location=Aachen |language=de |isbn=3-8265-5472-8}}</ref>

From 1960 to 1967, Hamhŭng was administered separately from South Hamgyŏng as a [[Special cities of North Korea|Directly Governed City]] (''Chikhalsi''). Before 1960 and since 1967, the city has been part of South Hamgyŏng Province.

In 1995, Hamhŭng witnessed, thus far, one of the only documented challenges to the North Korean [[Government of North Korea|government]] when [[North Korean famine|famine]]-ravaged [[Korean People's Army|soldiers]] began a march toward [[Pyongyang]]. The revolt was quelled, and the unit of soldiers was disbanded.<ref>{{cite book |last=Becker |first=Jasper |title=Rogue Regime: Kim Jong Il and the Looming Threat of North Korea |url=https://archive.org/details/rogueregimekimjo00beck |url-access=registration |date=May 2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=USA |pages=[https://archive.org/details/rogueregimekimjo00beck/page/199 199–200] |isbn=9780198038108}}</ref>

The [[North Korean famine|North Korean famine of the 1990s]] appears to have had a disproportionate effect on the people of Hamhung. [[Andrew Natsios]], a former aid worker, USAID administrator, and author of ''The Great North Korean Famine'', described Hamhung as "the city most devastated by [the] famine."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usip.org/pubs/specialreports/sr990802.html |title=The Politics of Famine in North Korea |access-date=2009-01-31 |work=U.S. Institute of Peace |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122071411/http://www.usip.org/pubs/specialreports/sr990802.html |archive-date=January 22, 2009}}</ref> Contemporary published reports from ''[[The Washington Post]]''<ref>{{cite news |title=Beyond a Wall of Secrecy, Devastation|newspaper=Washington Post|date=1997-10-19|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/18/AR2006101800728_pf.html | first=Keith B. | last=Richburg | access-date=2010-05-04}}</ref> and [[Reuters]]<ref>{{cite news |title=North Korea: Whole Generation of Children Affected by North Korean Famine.|agency=Reuters|date=1999-05-19|url=http://www.itnsource.com/shotlist/RTV/1999/05/19/905190018/}}</ref> describe numerous fresh graves on the surrounding hillsides and report that many of Hamhung's children were stunted by malnutrition.

There is speculation that Hamhung, with its high proportion of chemists and the site of a chemical-industrial complex built by the Japanese during World War II, might be the center for [[North Korea's illicit activities#Drug trade|North Korea's methamphetamine production]].<ref>{{Cite news |title=North Korea's Addicting Export: Crystal Meth |first=Isaac |last=Stone Fish |url=http://pulitzercenter.org/projects/china-meth-north-korea-addicting-export|newspaper=Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting |date=20 June 2011 |access-date=2011-06-27}}</ref>

==Economy==
Hamhung is much more economically diverse than most cities in North Korea, as Hamhung has many unique [[industrial sector|industries]]. Hamhung's [[Rural area|rural]] areas are used for [[Agricultural land|farm land]] and [[food distribution]] through the [[community]]. These lands mainly consist of paddies, but other crops are grown in small portion as well. Hamhŭng is an important [[chemical industry]] center in the DPRK.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=북한지역정보넷|url=http://www.cybernk.net/infoText/InfoAdminstList.aspx?mc=AD0103&direct=1&ac=A0801|access-date=2022-02-20|website=www.cybernk.net}}</ref> It is an industrial city which serves as a major port for [[Economy of North Korea|North Korean foreign trade]]. Production includes [[textiles]] (particularly [[vinalon]]), metalware, machinery, refined oil and processed food. [[:ko:2.8비날론련합기업소|2·8 vinalon union enterprise]] is located here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/CategoryNavi?category=field&keyword=%EC%A0%95%EC%B9%98%C2%B7%EB%B2%95%EC%A0%9C/%EB%B6%81%ED%95%9C&ridx=0&tot=1041|title=2·8비날론 연합기업소|website=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|access-date=2021-11-30|archive-date=2022-03-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220319094800/http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/CategoryNavi?category=field&keyword=%EC%A0%95%EC%B9%98%C2%B7%EB%B2%95%EC%A0%9C/%EB%B6%81%ED%95%9C&ridx=0&tot=1041|url-status=dead}}</ref>

While prior to [[liberation of Korea]] Hamhung had an extremely backwards economy due to the destructive actions of the Japanese, the city was rapidly developed afterwards, with new industrial districts being built and being broken free of colonial acquisitions of material. Much of the heavy industrial equipment used in other cities are built in Hamhung, and its production contributes to the monumental construction of buildings under projects launched by the Workers' Party.<ref name=":0" />

==Transportation==
The city is a [[Transport in North Korea|transportation]] hub, connecting various eastern ports and the northern interior area. Hamhung Station is on the [[Pyongra Line]] [[railway]]. This city is connected by air too, with [[Sondok Airport]]. The city is also served by the narrow gauge, commuter [[Soho Line]] linking West Hamhung to Hungnam, via February 28 Vinylon factory.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hamhung — Narrow Gauge S-Bahn Hamhung — Haenam|url=https://transphoto.org/articles/4043/|access-date=2020-10-16|website=transphoto.org}}</ref>

The city has a large [[trolleybus]] network, which opened in 1973 with the Hoyang - Doksong line, with a depot located at the northern Doksong terminus. The second and third lines, a pair of intercity lines from [[Hamhung station]] to the [[Hungnam]] area, was opened on 27 July 1991.
