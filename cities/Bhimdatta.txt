==Society==
The indigenous people living here are the [[Rana Tharu people|Rana-Tharus]], but people from other parts mostly from the hill districts [[Baitadi]], [[Darchula]] and [[Dadeldhura]], find themselves at home. Bhimdatta has become a unique combination of ethnic groups with different ways of life within an already diverse country [[Nepal]]. The festivals celebrated by the ethnic [[Tharu people]] are [[Holi]] and [[Maghe Sankranti|Maghi]]. Tharu people celebrate Maghi as New Year, while Hill People primarily celebrate Gora (commonly called [[Gaura]] Parba). Deepawali or [[Diwali]] or Tihar is a major festival which is celebrated with [[Lakshmi Puja|Laxmi Puja]], Gai Puja, and [[Bhai Tika]] on their respective days. [[Dashain]] is also a major festival here. A small population from western Nepal, mainly Arghakhachi, Gulmi, Pyuthan, etc., have settled here (mostly in Bhasi), even before local people of the same region settled from the hills of Far-west Nepal.

==Services==
Bhimdatta is the business and educational hub of the [[Mahakali Zone]]. Since it is in close proximity to the border with India, Bhimdattaa plays a major role in trade in the region. Students from neighbouring districts come for education. [[Far-western University]], which teaches diversified disciplines ranging from economics to the humanities to the sciences, is the only university in the city. People here are mainly occupied by agriculture as Nepal is an agrarian society. Business is another source of empowering the local economy, which is concentrated in the bazaar area of Bhimdatta. Government services are a significant part of the economy. Being comparatively closer to the major industrial areas of India, Mahendranagar could serve as a portal for industrial exchange between India and Nepal.

==Transport and communication==
[[Nepal Telecom]] and [[Ncell]] provide [[3G]] and [[4G]] facilities in the area. Bhimdatta is connected to other parts of Nepal by [[Mahendra Highway|East-West Highway]], which is the only road that connects it to the rest of Nepal. There is a domestic airport in Bhimdatta which is out of service. Bus service connects Bhimdatta to all the other parts of the country. There is a [[Geography of Nepal#Border crossing|customs post]] for goods and third-country nationals, while Indian and [[Nepali people|Nepalese]] nationals may cross the border freely. [[Banbasa]], [[Uttarakhand]] state, [[India]] is the other side of the border.  Bhimdatta is the nearest place in Nepal to [[Uttarakhand]], which is part of India.  Bhimdatta is also connected by sub-highways to hill towns [[Dipayal]], [[Baitadi]], [[Amargadhi]], and [[Darchula]].

==Education==
Mahendranagar is the home of the [[Far Western University]]; it has a number of colleges and educational institutes.
