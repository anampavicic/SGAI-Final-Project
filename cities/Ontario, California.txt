'''Ontario''' is a city in southwestern [[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] in the U.S. state of California, {{convert|35|mi}} east of [[downtown Los Angeles]] and {{convert|23|mi}} west of [[downtown San Bernardino]], the county seat. Located in the western part of the [[Inland Empire]] metropolitan area, it lies just east of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] and is part of the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]]. As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the city had a population of 175,265.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=1600000US0653896|title=Census - Geography Profile: Ontario city, California|access-date=September 5, 2022}}</ref>

The city is home to [[Ontario International Airport]], which is the 15th-busiest airport in the United States by cargo carried. Ontario handles the mass of freight traffic between the ports of [[Port of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]] and [[Port of Long Beach|Long Beach]] and the rest of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://inlandempireoutlook.org/2009/11/26/ontario-the-inland-empire%E2%80%99s-new-urban-center/ |title=Ontario: Inland Empire Urban Center |publisher=Inlandempireoutlook.org |date=November 26, 2009 |access-date=December 11, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320160905/http://inlandempireoutlook.org/2009/11/26/ontario-the-inland-empire%E2%80%99s-new-urban-center/|archive-date=March 20, 2012}}</ref>

It takes its name from the Ontario Model Colony development established in 1882 by the Canadian engineer [[George Chaffey]] and his brothers [[William Chaffey]] and Charles Chaffey.<ref>[http://www.ci.ontario.ca.us/index.cfm/21956/17099 History of Ontario] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415011446/http://www.ci.ontario.ca.us/index.cfm/21956/17099 |date=April 15, 2010 }} Retrieved May 12, 2010.</ref> They named the settlement after their home [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Ontario]].

{{Main|Tongva}}
Ontario was inhabited by the [[Tongva]] people for over 1,000 years.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WA4vBQAAQBAJ&q=images+of+america+california |title=Early Ontario |publisher=Arcadia |year=2014 |isbn=9781467132404}}</ref> Their country is now known as [[Tovaangar]]. The Ontario area was connected to the village of [[Rancho Cucamonga, California|Cucamonga]], whose location is not now precisely known.

The [[Spanish Empire]]'s [[New Spain]] [[Portolá expedition]] found and named the [[Santa Ana River]] in 1769.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Mitchell |first=Patrick |title=From Crest to Coast—110 Miles Along Southern California's Largest River System |publisher=Wilderness Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-89997-411-2 |pages=37}}</ref> They also explored the Cucamonga area.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 17, 2020 |title=Rancho Cucamonga |url=https://www.blm.gov/blog/2020-09-17/rancho-cucamonga |website=[[Bureau of Land Management]]}}</ref>

=== Spanish Empire (1771–1822) ===

In 1771, [[Franciscans]] from [[New Spain]] settled nearby, and established the [[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel]], founding what is today [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 27, 2009 |title=San Gabriel Arcangel |url=http://missions.bgmm.com/sgabriel.htm |access-date=March 10, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327033851/http://missions.bgmm.com/sgabriel.htm |archive-date=March 27, 2009 }}</ref> They enslaved the Tongva people.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |author-first1=Hadley|author-last1=Meares|date=June 29, 2016 |title=Genocide, Slavery, and L.A.'s Role in the Decimation of Native Californians |url=https://www.pbssocal.org/shows/lost-la/genocide-slavery-and-l-a-s-role-in-the-decimation-of-native-californians |access-date=March 11, 2024 |website=PBS SoCal |language=en}}</ref> The area was now part of the New Spain [[Province of Las Californias]].

The route became known as the [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]].

In 1804, the northern part of Las Californias became the new province of [[Alta California|Nueva California]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Nuttall |first=Donald A. |date=1972 |title=The Gobernantes of Spanish Upper California: A Profile |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25157389 |journal=California Historical Quarterly |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=253–280 |doi=10.2307/25157389 |jstor=25157389 |issn=0097-6059}}</ref>

In 1810, the San Gabriel Franciscans took over the Tongva village of [[Kaawchama]] (in today's west [[Redlands, California|Redlands]]), replacing it with the [[Guachama Rancheria|Guachama rancheria]]. This included a chapel devoted to San Bernardino (beginning the association of the saint with the area). The rancheria was destroyed by the [[Serrano people|Serrano]] in 1812, and was rebuilt nearby as the [[San Bernardino de Sena Estancia|San Bernardino de Sena estancia]] in 1819.

=== Mexico (1822–1847) ===
{{Main|Californios}}
In 1822, word of the Mexican triumph in the [[Mexican War of Independence]] reached Nueva California,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mexican California {{!}} Early California History: An Overview {{!}} Articles and Essays {{!}} California as I Saw It: First-Person Narratives of California's Early Years, 1849-1900 {{!}} Digital Collections {{!}} Library of Congress |url=https://www.loc.gov/collections/california-first-person-narratives/articles-and-essays/early-california-history/mexican-california/ |access-date=March 11, 2024 |website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA}}</ref> and the lands previously controlled by the Spanish Empire passed to the custody of the [[Mexican government]].

In 1824, the province of Nueva California was renamed [[Alta California]].

In 1826, American explorer [[Jedediah Smith]] passed through what is now [[Upland, California|Upland]] on the first known overland journey from the east coast to the west coast of North America. He used Native American trails that he helped establish as the [[California Trail]].

Use of the San Gabriel mission's [[Rancho Cucamonga]] was in 1839 granted to [[Tiburcio Tapia]] by Alta Californian governor [[Juan Bautista Alvarado]] as part of the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularization of California land holdings]].<ref name=":02">{{Cite book |url=https://digicoll.lib.berkeley.edu/record/267557 |title=Cucamonga [San Bernardino County] Leon V.

=== United States (1847 onward) ===

==== 1800s ====
In January 1847, the area became controlled by the United States following the [[conquest of California]] as part of the [[Mexican–American War|Mexican-American War]], and was formalised by the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Dale L.

It ruled it under a [[Interim government of California|military administration]] until a new civilian body was established in December 1849, which became the state of [[California]] in September 1850. In February 1850, the interim California government established [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. (The earlier Los Angeles municipal government did not cover today's Ontario.)<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Guinn |first1=J.

The new Californian administration soon began a war of extermination against the Tongva, which came to be known as being part of the [[California genocide]].<ref name=":0" /> 1850's [[Act for the Government and Protection of Indians]] ensured that slavery of the people it covered remained legal.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=yLbNA_3CdcQC&dq=%22Act+for+the+Government+and+Protection+of+Indians%22&pg=PA822 '''Compiled laws of the State of California: containing all the acts of the Legislature of a public and general nature, now in force, passed at the sessions of 1850-51-52-53''', Benicia, S.

[[San Bernardino County, California|San Bernardino County]] was founded in 1853, following the establishment of [[San Bernardino, California|a new Mormon settlement]]. A road was built between San Bernardino and Los Angeles that year, passing through Rancho Cucamonga.<ref name=":1" />

Rancho Cucamonga was sold in 1858 to [[John Rains House|John Rains]].

Slavery of Native Americans became illegal in California in 1865.<ref name="OHP2">{{cite web |last1=Dutschke |first1=Dwight |date=2014 |title=A History of American Indians in California |url=http://ohp.parks.ca.gov/pages/1054/files/american%20indians%20in%20california.pdf |access-date=October 10, 2016 |website=California Office of Historic Preservation, Five Views: An Ethnic Historic Site Survey for California}}</ref>

In 1881, the Chaffey brothers, [[George Chaffey|George]] and [[William Chaffey|William]], purchased a parcel of Hellman's Rancho Cucamonga land, and rights to Mount San Antonio water. The brothers established a settlement they named "Ontario" in honor of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[Ontario]] in [[Canada]], where they were from.<ref>[https://www.ontarioca.gov/Planning/HistoricPreservation#:~:text=The%20township%20of%20Ontario%2C%20California,for%20the%20Community%20of%20Ontario. Historic Preservation | City of Ontario, California]</ref>

The land was sometimes referred to the "San Antonio lands", as they included half the water rights to [[Mount San Antonio]]<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Hackenberger |first=Benjamin C. |date=January 2015 |title=The San Antonio Wash: Addressing the Gap Between Claremont and Upland |url=https://scholarship.claremont.edu/pomona_theses/136/ |journal=Pomona Senior Theses}}</ref> (colloquially known as "Mount Baldy"). They engineered a drainage system channelling water from the foothills of the mountain down to the flatter lands below that performed the dual functions of allowing farmers to water their crops and preventing the floods that periodically afflict them.

They also created the main thoroughfare of Euclid Avenue ([[State Route 83 (California)|California Highway 83]]), with its distinctive wide lanes and grassy median. A mule-drawn passenger tramway was used from 1887 to 1895 on the central reservation the Avenue, operated by the [[Ontario and San Antonio Heights Railroad Company]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pacific Electric Ontario & San Antonio Heights Line |url=https://www.erha.org/peeosah.htm |access-date=March 11, 2024 |website=www.erha.org}}</ref>

The San Antonio Water Company was incorporated in October 1882. Since then it has served the area that is today Ontario, Upland and San Antonio Heights, and to a lesser extent Montclair.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History |url=https://www.sawaterco.com/history |access-date=2024-07-20 |website=San Antonio Water Company |language=en}}</ref>

In 1885, the Chaffey brothers opened a campus of the [[University of Southern California]]. This included a secondary school.

Also in 1885, the ''[[The Daily Report (Ontario, California)|Ontario Record]]'' newspaper was founded. (It would later be known as ''The Daily Report''.)

The new "Model Colony" (called so because it offered the perfect balance between agriculture and the urban comforts of schools, churches, and commerce) was originally conceived as a [[Teetotalism|dry]] town, early deeds containing clauses forbidding the manufacture or sale of alcoholic beverages within the town.
[[File:Interior_of_citrus_packing_house,_Ontario,_ca.1905_(CHS-1677).jpg|thumb|Interior of citrus packing house in Ontario, 1905]]
Ontario attracted farmers (primarily growing [[citrus]]) and ailing Easterners seeking a drier climate (often to treat [[tuberculosis]]). To impress visitors and potential settlers with the "abundance" of water in Ontario, a fountain was placed at the [[Ontario station (Amtrak)|Southern Pacific railway station]]. It was turned on when passenger trains were approaching and frugally turned off again after their departure. The original "Chaffey fountain", a simple spigot surrounded by a ring of white stones, was later replaced by the more ornate "Frankish Fountain", an art nouveau creation now located outside the Ontario Museum of History and Art.<ref>{{cite web |title=The City of Ontario's Citrus Industry |url=https://www.ontarioca.gov/sites/default/files/Ontario-Files/Planning/Historic_Preservation/citrus_industry.pdf}}</ref> Agriculture was vital to the early economy, and many street names recall this legacy. The [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist]] plant remains as a living vestige of the citrus era.

The Chaffey brothers left in 1886 to found the Australian irrigation settlements of [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]] and [[Renmark, South Australia|Renmark]], selling their Ontario assets to the Ontario Land & Improvement Company. Its president was Charles Frankish.<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 June 1980 |title=NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES INVENTORY &ndash; NOMINATION FORM |url=https://npgallery.nps.gov/GetAsset/5038fc9f-c181-414a-8b78-cffcf286ff6b |website=National Park Service}}</ref> He founded the [[Ontario State Bank Block|Ontario State Bank]] in 1887, the settlement's first bank.<ref name=":22">{{Cite web |title=California Genealogy Trails - Californian American Bios page 8 |url=http://genealogytrails.com/cal/americanbios_page8.html |access-date=January 2, 2024 |website=genealogytrails.com}}</ref>

Central Ontario was incorporated as a city in 1891.<ref name=":12" /> The San Antonio Electric Light & Power Company was organized in 1891 to provide electricity to Ontario, Pomona and Redlands.<ref name=":12" /> 
[[File:GraberOliveHouseVatRoom.JPG|thumb|The olive vat room at [[Graber Olive House]] in Ontario, California. In 1894, two years after planting olive trees in Ontario, C. C. Graber began selling [[Back olive|vat cured olives]] from the pictured vat room in vats similar to the ones pictured. Graber Olive House is the oldest operating olive packer in the United States.]]
The [[Graber Olive House]] was established in 1894, and is now the longest operating olive packing business in the United States.

In 1895, the Ontario Electric Company was established by Charles Frankish.<ref name=":22" /> In its first year it took over the mule-cars, and replaced them with electrical powered vehicles.<ref name=":22" />

==== 1900s ====
The City of Ontario's territory was greatly expanded in 1900.<ref name=":12" />

[[File:Ontario Mills sign.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ontario Mills]] in 2005]]

In the years following Ontario's founding, the economy was driven by its reputation as a health resort. Shortly thereafter, citrus farmers began taking advantage of Ontario's rocky soil to plant lemon and orange groves. Agricultural opportunities also attracted [[vintner]]s and [[olive]] growers. The [[Graber Olive House]], which continues to produce olives, is a city historical landmark and one of the oldest institutions in Ontario.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} [[Dairy]] farming is also prevalent, as it continues to be in neighboring [[Chino, California|Chino]]. Much of southern Ontario still contains dairy farms and other [[agriculture|agricultural]] farms.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Singh |first=Maanvi |date=September 13, 2022 |title='Monstrosities in the farmland': how giant warehouses transformed a California town |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/13/ontario-california-amazon-warehouses |access-date=September 13, 2022 |work=The Guardian |language=en}}</ref> However, the area is currently under planning to be developed into a mixed-use area of residential homes, industrial and business parks, and town centers, collectively known as the New Model Colony.<ref>Khouri, Andrew (November 6, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/business/realestate/la-fi-property-report-ontario-20141106-story.html "Ontario housing development restarts after stalling during recession"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''</ref>

A major pre-war industry was the city's [[General Electric]] plant that produced clothing [[Ironing|irons]]. During and after [[World War II]], Ontario experienced a housing boom common to many suburbs.

==Arts and culture==
Ontario is home to three museums, the Ontario Museum of History and Art, the Chaffey Community Museum of Art, and the Ontario Police Museum.

[[File:The Granada.jpg|thumb|Granada Theatre, {{Circa|1940}}]]

Built in 1925, The Granada Theatre was leased to West Coast Junior Theater. By the 1940s, the theater had become part of the Fox West Coast Theater chain. The Granada Theatre was designed by architect L.A. Smith.<ref>{{cite web |title=City of Ontario Designated Landmarks |url=https://www.ontarioca.gov/sites/default/files/Ontario-Files/Planning/Historic_Preservation/designated_landmarks.pdf}}</ref>

Ontario is also the home to the second largest consumer Quilt Show in the United States, ''Road to California''. The quilt show books over 2,400 room nights and has a recorded attendance of over 40,000 attendees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailybulletin.com/business/20160225/ontario-convention-center-attracting-more-and-more-conventions |title=Ontario Convention Center attracting more and more conventions |website=dailybulletin.com|date=February 25, 2016 }}</ref>

The Ontario post office contains two oil on canvas murals, ''The Dream'' depicting founder Chaffey with surveyors and ''The Reality'' which shows a view of the completed Euclid Avenue, painted by WPA muralist [[Nellie Geraldine Best]] in 1942.<ref>{{cite news|title=Murals will adorn walls of post office|newspaper=The San Bernardino County Sun |date=October 29, 1942 |page=15 |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/5071186/the_san_bernardino_county_sun/ |publisher=San Bernardino Country Sun|access-date=April 13, 2017}}</ref>

Since 1959, Ontario has placed three-dimensional [[nativity scene]]s on the median of Euclid Avenue during the Christmas season. The scenes, featuring statues by the sculptor Rudolph Vargas, were challenged in 1998 as a violation of [[Separation of church and state|church-state separation]] under the [[California Constitution]] by an atheist resident, but the dispute was resolved when private organizations began funding the storage and labor involved in the set-up and maintenance of the scenery in its entirety.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chaffey.org/community/dailybulletin/1990s/1999/1999_12_22_ontario_declares_nativity_historical.html |title=chaffey.org |publisher=chaffey.org |date=December 22, 1999 |access-date=December 11, 2011}}</ref>  To support the nativity scenes the Ontario Chamber of Commerce started a craft fair called "Christmas on Euclid".

The All-States Picnic, an [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] celebration, began in 1939 to recognize the varied origins of the city's residents. Picnic tables lined the median of Euclid Avenue from Hawthorne to E Street, with signs for each of the country's 48 states. The picnic was suspended during [[World War II]], but when it resumed in 1948, it attracted 120,000 people. A 1941 [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] cartoon listed Ontario's picnic table as the "world's longest". As native Californians came to outnumber the out-of-state-born, the celebration waned in popularity until it was discontinued in 1981. It was revived in 1991 as a celebration of civic pride.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailybulletin.com/livinghere/ci_2733033 |title=dailybulletin.com |publisher=dailybulletin.com |access-date=December 11, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204124349/http://www.dailybulletin.com/livinghere/ci_2733033 |archive-date=February 4, 2012  }}</ref>

==Sports==
[[File:Metallica 2008 Ontario California1.jpg|thumb|Toyota Arena]]

It is an 11,000-seat multi-purpose arena, the largest enclosed arena in the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]]. Over 125 events are held annually featuring sporting competitions, concerts, and family shows.

In January 2015, the [[American Hockey League]], a minor league above the [[ECHL]], announced that it was forming a new Pacific Division and would be replacing the ECHL Ontario Reign with a relocated team. The Kings relocated the [[Manchester Monarchs (AHL)|Manchester Monarchs]], a franchise they had owned and operated since 2012, and became the [[Ontario Reign]] beginning with the [[2015–16 AHL season]].
