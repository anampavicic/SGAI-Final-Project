== History==
The current city of Kandhkot is about 200 years old. Kalhora Dynasty established the fort here within their ending days. After Kalhora's, this area remained under the territory of Talpur's known as Mir till 1841, Khangarh now Jacobabad, handed over to East India through Treaty. Kandhkot was a small village during that time with a population of about 100 souls.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-06-20 |title=History of Kandhkot - Baloch Lens |url=https://balochlens.com/history-of-kandhkot/ |access-date=2022-06-23 |language=en-US}}</ref>

As per Ardo Urtradi, the famous sindhi writer and historian, the name "Kandhkot" is often thought to mean "the city on the bank of a river." However, this interpretation is a fabrication. While it's true that many forts were constructed along the banks of the mighty Indus River, none of these forts bear the name "Kandhkot." Instead, the real story behind the city's name and its historical significance lies elsewhere, shrouded in the rich tapestry of its past.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/san_0292/page/n35/mode/2up |title=ڪشمور ضلعي جي تاريخ |publisher=Naeen Sindh |year=2013 |edition=1st |publication-date=2013 |pages=35-37 |language=Sindhi |trans-title=History of Kashmore District}}</ref>
