'''Alcobendas''' ({{IPA|es|alkoˈβendas|lang|Pronunciation of Alcobendas in Spanish.ogg}}) is a [[Municipalities in Spain|municipality]] of [[Spain]] located in the [[Community of Madrid]].

It forms an urban continuum with the neighbouring municipality of [[San Sebastián de los Reyes]]. The affluent residential area of [[La Moraleja]] lies within the municipal limits, segregated from the main urban nucleus by the [[Autovía A-1|A-1]] highway. The municipality features the Valdelatas [[nature reserve]] and a light [[industrial estate]]. It also houses a basketball museum organised by the [[Pedro Ferrándiz]] Foundation, where the [[FIBA Hall of Fame]] is located.

Once a working-class area, Alcobendas has become one of the most economically affluent municipalities in the [[Madrid metropolitan area]].
