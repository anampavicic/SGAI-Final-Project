'''Sidi Bel Abbès''' ({{langx|ar|سيدي بلعباس}}), also called '''Bel Abbès''', is the capital (2005 pop. 200,000)<ref name=sidi>''Sidi Bel Abbes'', lexicorient.com  (Encyclopaedia of the Orient), internet article.</ref> of the [[Sidi Bel Abbes (province)|Sidi Bel Abbès]] [[wilaya]] (2005 pop. 590,000), [[Algeria]]. It is named after Sidi bel Abbass, a Muslim [[marabout]] or noble man who is buried there.<ref name=sidi/> The city is the commercial center of an important area of vineyards, [[market garden]]s, orchards, and grain fields. It was formerly surrounded by a wall with four gates, and today is home to a university. Sidi Bel Abbès is 75 kilometers from the [[Mediterranean Sea]].

==History==
The present city, on the Wadi [[Sig River]], developed around a [[France|French]] camp built in 1843. In 1849 a planned agricultural town was established around the existing military post. From the 1830s until 1962 the city was closely associated with the [[French Foreign Legion]], being the location of its basic training camp, and the headquarters of its [[1st Foreign Regiment]]. In the late 1890s the town, described as being of Spanish appearance, had a [[civilian]] population of about 30,000.<ref>Martin Windrow, page 138 ''Our Friends Beneath the Sands - The Foreign Legion in France's Colonial Conquests 1870-1935'', {{ISBN|978-0-297-85213-1}}</ref> The main buildings were in the French military district of the ''Quartier Vienot''.The training centre of the modern Algerian National Gendarmerie is located in Sidi Bel Abbès.

In the 1930s much of the old city walls were demolished. Wide boulevards and [[Town square|squares]] replaced the traditional quarters, causing the town to lose much of its former character.

==Geography==
The city sits astride both banks of the [[Sig River]], and lake ''Sidi Mohamed Benali''. The lake provides a major water reserve for the area.

===Climate===
Sidi Bel Abbès has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BSk'').
