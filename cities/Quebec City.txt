==Name and usage==
{{Further|Name of Quebec City|Quebec#Etymology}}
Common [[English language|English-language]] usage distinguishes the city from the province by referring to the former as Quebec City.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Government of Canada |first1=Public Services and Procurement Canada |title=Québec, City of Québec, Quebec City – Writing Tips Plus – Writing Tools – Resources of the Language Portal of Canada – Canada.ca |url=https://www.noslangues-ourlanguages.gc.ca/en/writing-tips-plus/quebec-city-of |website=Writing Tips Plus |access-date=20 May 2022 |date=28 February 2020}}</ref>

According to the Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, and the Geographical Names Board of Canada, the names of Canadian cities and towns have only one official form. Thus, Québec is officially spelled with an accented é in both [[Canadian English]] and [[French language|French]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016 |title=Québec, City of Québec, Quebec City |url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2guides/guides/wrtps/index-eng.html?lang=eng&lettr=indx_catlog_q&page=9M186EWC4Ldg.html#zz9M186EWC4Ldg |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914012658/http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tpv2guides/guides/wrtps/index-eng.html?lang=eng&lettr=indx_catlog_q&page=9M186EWC4Ldg.html#zz9M186EWC4Ldg |archive-date=14 September 2016 |access-date=29 October 2016 |publisher=Public Works and Government Services Canada}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Names (geographical) |url=http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/abt-aps/stgd-gdst/index-eng.htm#toc2.15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161121144149/http://www.psc-cfp.gc.ca/abt-aps/stgd-gdst/index-eng.htm#toc2.15 |archive-date=21 November 2016 |access-date=29 October 2016 |publisher=Public Service Commission of Canada}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Government of Canada |date=8 October 2009 |title=Geographical Names |url=http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-chap?lang=eng&lettr=chapsect15&info0=15#zz15 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161030002236/http://www.btb.termiumplus.gc.ca/tcdnstyl-chap?lang=eng&lettr=chapsect15&info0=15#zz15 |archive-date=30 October 2016 |access-date=29 October 2016 |publisher=The Canadian Style}}</ref> However, province names can have different forms in English and French. As a result, in English, the federal government style distinguishes the city and province by spelling the city with an acute accent (Québec) and the province without one (Quebec). The government of Quebec spells both names "Québec", including when writing in English.<ref>{{cite web |title=Faut-il traduire les toponymes? |url=https://toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/normes-procedures/regles-ecriture/traduire-toponymes.html |website=Commission de toponymie |access-date=20 May 2022 |date=26 November 2020}}</ref>

In French, the two are distinguished in that province names including Quebec generally take [[definite article]]s, while city names do not. As a result, the city is {{lang|fr|Québec}} and the province is {{lang|fr|le Québec}}; "in Quebec City" is {{lang|fr|à Québec}} and "in the province of Quebec" is {{lang|fr|au Québec}}; and so forth.<ref>{{cite web |title=Québec en quelques mots |url=https://immigrantquebec.com/fr/reussir-votre-installation/vivre-a-quebec/connaitre-quebec/quebec-en-quelques-mots/ |website=Immigrant Québec |access-date=20 May 2022 |language=fr-CA |date=22 October 2021}}</ref>

==History==
{{See also|History of Quebec City|Timeline of Quebec City history}}

=== French regime (1500s–1763) ===
Quebec City is one of the oldest European settlements in [[North America]] and the only fortified city north of [[Mexico]] whose walls still exist.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CBC.CA – Seven Wonders of Canada – Your Nominations – Old Quebec City, Quebec |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sevenwonders/wonder_quebec_city.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401022236/https://www.cbc.ca/sevenwonders/wonder_quebec_city.html |archive-date=1 April 2019 |access-date=31 March 2019 |website=www.cbc.ca}}</ref> While many of the major cities in [[Latin America]] date from the 16th century, among cities in Canada and the United States, few were created earlier than Quebec City ([[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Harbour Grace]], [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port Royal]], [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]], [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]], and [[Tadoussac]]).
[[File:Jacques Cartier rencontre les indiens de Stadacone, 1535.jpg|left|thumb|Depiction of [[Jacques Cartier]]'s meeting with the indigenous people of [[Stadacona]] in 1535]]

It is home to the earliest known French settlement in North America, [[Charlesbourg-Royal|Fort Charlesbourg-Royal]], established in 1541 by explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] with some 400 persons but abandoned less than a year later due to the harsh winter and resistance of indigenous inhabitants to colonial incursion on their land.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fort Charlesbourg Royal National Historic Site of Canada |url=https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16661 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028235615/https://www.historicplaces.ca/en/rep-reg/place-lieu.aspx?id=16661 |archive-date=28 October 2021 |access-date=6 October 2018 |website=www.historicplaces.ca |publisher=Parks Canada |language=en}}</ref> The fort was at the mouth of the [[Rivière du Cap Rouge]], in the suburban former [[Cap-Rouge, Quebec City|town of Cap-Rouge]] (which merged into Quebec City in 2002).

Quebec was founded by [[Samuel de Champlain]], a French explorer and diplomat, on 3 July 1608,<ref name="WDL1">{{Cite web |title=View of Quebec, Capital of Canada |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/224 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028235552/https://www.wdl.org/en/item/224/nearest-items.json?limit=25 |archive-date=28 October 2021 |access-date=11 February 2013 |publisher=[[World Digital Library]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Moss |first=William |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_CJBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT334 |title=The Recent Archaeology of the Early Modern Period in Quebec City: 2009 |date=2 December 2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781351193337 |pages=334 |language=en |access-date=30 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028235557/https://books.google.com/books?id=_CJBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT334 |archive-date=28 October 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref> and at the site of a long abandoned [[Laurentian language|St. Lawrence Iroquoian]] settlement called [[Stadacona]]. Champlain, who came to be called "The Father of [[New France]]", served as its administrator for the rest of his life.

The [[name of Canada|name "Canada"]] was given to the colony that developed around the settlement at Quebec. Although the [[Acadia]]n settlement at [[Port-Royal (Acadia)|Port-Royal]] was established three years earlier, Quebec came to be known as the cradle of North America's [[French language|Francophone]] population. The location seemed favourable to the establishment of a permanent colony.

Quebec was the headquarters of many raids against [[New England]] during the [[French and Indian Wars]]. In 1690 the city [[battle of Quebec (1690)|was attacked by the English]], but was successfully defended. In the last of the conflicts, the [[French and Indian War]] ([[Seven Years' War]]), Quebec was captured by the British in 1759, and held until the end of the war in 1763. In that time many battles and sieges took place: the [[Battle of Beauport]], a French victory (31 July 1759); the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]], in which British troops under General [[James Wolfe]] defeated the French General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] on 13 September 1759, and shortly thereafter took the city after a short siege. A French counterattack saw a French victory at the [[Battle of Sainte-Foy]] (28 April 1760) but the subsequent second [[Siege of Quebec (1760)|Siege of Quebec]] the following month however saw a final British victory.[[File:PlainsOfAbraham2007.jpg|thumb|left|After a campaign of three months British forces captured Quebec City after the Battle of the Plains of Abraham.]]

At the end of French rule, Quebec was a town of 8,000 inhabitants, surrounded by forests, villages, fields and pastures. The town was distinguished by its monumental architecture, fortifications, and affluent homes of masonry and shacks in the suburbs of Saint-Jean and Saint-Roch. Despite its urbanity and its status as capital, Quebec remained a small city with close ties to its rural surroundings. Nearby inhabitants traded their farm surpluses and firewood for imported goods from France at the two city markets.

During the [[American Revolution]], revolutionary troops from the southern colonies [[Battle of Quebec (1775)|assaulted the British garrison in the city]] in the hope that the peoples of Quebec would rise and join the [[American Revolution]] so that Canada would join the [[Continental Congress]], along with the other British colonies of continental North America. The American invasion failed, however, and the war resulted in a permanent split of British North America into two entitles: the newly independent [[United States of America]], and those colonies (including Quebec) that remained under British control, which would later become the country of [[Canada]].

The city itself was not attacked during the [[War of 1812]], when the United States again attempted to annex Canadian lands. Amid fears of another American attack on Quebec City, construction of the [[Citadelle of Quebec]] began in 1820. The Americans did not attack Canada after the War of 1812, but the Citadelle continued to house a large British garrison until 1871. It is still in use by the military and is also a tourist attraction.

Until the late 18th century Québec was the most populous city in present-day Canada. As of the census of 1790, Montreal surpassed it with 18,000 inhabitants, but Quebec, which had about 14,000 of population at that time, remained the administrative capital of the former New France.<ref name="Cartier">{{Cite journal |last=Cartier |first=Gwenaël |date=2009 |title=Québec 1608–2008 : 400 ans de statistiques démographiques tirées des recensements |url=https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/cqd/2008-v37-n1-cqd2900/029642ar/ |url-status=live |journal=Cahiers québécois de démographie |language=fr |volume=37 |page=143 |doi=10.7202/029642ar |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180729111705/https://www.erudit.org/en/journals/cqd/2008-v37-n1-cqd2900/029642ar/ |archive-date=29 July 2018 |access-date=29 July 2018 |doi-access=}}</ref> It was then made the capital of [[Lower Canada]] by the [[Constitutional Act of 1791]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ville de Québec – Québec City, Fortress and Port (1756–1867) |url=https://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/en/apropos/portrait/histoire/1756-1867.aspx |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028235646/https://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/en/apropos/portrait/histoire/1756-1867.aspx |archive-date=28 October 2021 |access-date=31 March 2019 |website=Ville de Québec}}</ref> From 1841 to 1867, the capital of the [[Province of Canada]] rotated between [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Montreal]], [[Toronto]], [[Ottawa]] and Quebec City (from 1851 to 1855 and from 1859 to 1865).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clapperton |first1=Nina |title=13 Canada Capital Cities |url=https://ninaoutandabout.ca/canada-capital-cities/ |website=Nina Out and About |date=18 November 2021 |access-date=10 April 2022}}</ref>

The city experienced an economic golden age in the 1800s, due to its favorable location on the Saint Lawrence River which gave rise to industries of wooden [[Sailing ship|sailing]] ships manufacture, export of squared [[Lumber|timber logs]]. to Europe, as wall as associated enterprises such as [[sawmill]]s. However, by the 1870s, Québec City entered a period of economic decline. Contributing factors included the rise of steel-hulled [[Steamship|steamships,]] the expansion of railroads at the expense of waterways for continental commerce; the depletion of forest resources near major rivers upstream of Québec City and in the west of the province, which were transported to [[Port of Quebec|Québec's port]] by [[log driving]]; the construction of [[St. Lawrence Seaway|locks on the Saint Lawrence Seaway]], opening up trade routes to the U.S. from Montreal; and the city's inability to retain immigrant populations.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Langlois |first=Simon |date=2007 |title=Sociologie de la ville de Québec |url=https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/cdd/2007-n61-cdd3633/039157ar/ |journal=Les Cahiers des dix |language=fr |issue= 61|page=196 |doi=10.7202/039157ar |issn=0575-089X}}</ref> This unfavourable context, coupled with the departure of the British army from the city's Citadel in 1871, contributed to the exodus of English speaking populations, such as local bourgeoisie of Scottish origin or workers of Irish background, to Montreal in the second half of the 19th century.

The [[Quebec Conference, 1864|Quebec Conference]] on [[Canadian Confederation]] was held in the city in 1864. In 1867, [[Queen Victoria]] chose Ottawa as the definite capital of the Dominion of Canada, while Quebec City was confirmed as the capital of the newly created province of Quebec.

During World War II, two conferences were held in Quebec City. The [[Quebec Conference, 1943|First Quebec Conference]] was held in 1943 with [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (President of the United States), [[Winston Churchill]] (Prime Minister of the United Kingdom), [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] (Prime Minister of Canada) and [[T. V. Soong]] (minister of foreign affairs of [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|China]]). The [[Second Quebec Conference]] was held in 1944 and was attended by Churchill and Roosevelt. They took place in the buildings of the Citadelle and at the nearby [[Château Frontenac]]. A large part of the [[D-Day]] landing plans were made during those meetings.

Until 2002, Quebec was a mostly urbanized city and its territory coterminous with today's borough of [[La Cité-Limoilou]]. The Government of Quebec then mandated a [[2000–06 municipal reorganization in Quebec|municipal reorganization in the province]], and many [[suburbs]] of the north shore of the Saint-Lawrence were merged into Quebec City, taking the form of [[Borough#Canada|boroughs]], thus constituting the boundary of present-day Québec City. In 2008 the city celebrated its [[400th anniversary of Quebec City|400th anniversary]] and was gifted funds for festivities and construction projects by provincial and federal governments, as well as [[public artwork]] by various entities, including foreign countries.

Quebec City experiences four distinct seasons. Summers are warm and occasionally hot, with periods of hotter temperatures which compounded with the high humidity, create a high heat index that belies the average high of {{convert|22|-|25|C}} and lows of {{Convert|11|-|13|C}}. Winters are cold, windy and snowy with average high temperatures {{Convert|-5|to|-8|C}} and lows {{convert|-13|to|-18|C}}. Spring and fall, although short, bring chilly to warm temperatures. Late heat waves as well as "[[Indian summer]]s" are a common occurrence.{{citation needed|reason=more common than elsewhere?|date=March 2011}}

On average, Quebec City receives {{convert|1190|mm|2}} of precipitation, of which {{convert|899|mm|2}} is rain and {{convert|303|mm|2}} is the melt from {{convert|316|cm|1}} of snowfall per annum.<ref group="note">Although snow is measured in cm the melted snow (water equivalent) is measured in mm and added to the rainfall to obtain the total precipitation.

The southwest former cities of [[Sillery, Quebec City|Sillery]], [[Cap-Rouge, Quebec City|Cap-Rouge]] and [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]] are considered to be the wealthiest, along with some parts of Montcalm and Old Quebec.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The city's traditional working-class areas are found in the lower town below Old Quebec (Saint-Sauveur and Saint-Roch) and directly across the [[Saint-Charles River (Quebec City)|Saint-Charles River]] to the north (Vanier and Limoilou). However, parts of Limoilou, Saint-Sauveur and particularly Saint-Roch have seen [[gentrification]] in the last 20 years, attracting young professionals and the construction of new offices and condos.<ref name="cbd" />

Northern sections (Loretteville, Val-Bélair) and eastern sections (Beauport, Charlesbourg) are mostly a mix of middle-class residential suburbs with industrial pockets.

=== Immigration ===
The [[2021 Canadian census|2021 census]] reported that [[Immigration to Canada|immigrants]] (individuals born outside Canada) comprise 45,230 persons or 8.5% of the total population of Quebec City. Of the total immigrant population, the top countries of origin were France (7,360 persons or 16.3%), Colombia (2,865 persons or 6.3%), Morocco (2,715 persons or 6.0%), Ivory Coast (2,500 persons or 5.5%), Cameroon (2,225 persons or 4.9%), Algeria (1,920 persons or 4.2%), Tunisia (1,795 persons or 4.0%), Democratic Republic of the Congo (1,315 persons or 1,315%), Haiti (1,120 persons or 2.5%), and Brazil (1,115 persons or 2.5%).<ref name="2021censusB"/>

The great majority of city residents are native French speakers. The English-speaking community peaked in relative terms during the 1860s, when 40% of Quebec City's residents were [[English language|Anglophone]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Morrin Centre |title=Anglos in Québec |url=http://www.morrin.org/pages/anglos.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306032111/http://www.morrin.org/pages/anglos.php |archive-date=6 March 2012 |access-date=15 March 2007 |publisher=Literary and Historical Society of Quebec}}</ref><ref>Blair, Louisa.

In 2021, according to Statistics Canada, 90.6% of Quebec City's population spoke French as their sole mother tongue. More than a third of city residents reported being capable of speaking both French and English.

While the traditional [[central business district]]s and their large office buildings are found on [[Parliament Hill (Quebec City)|Parliament Hill]] (especially for provincial administration) and just below in [[Saint-Roch, Quebec City|Saint-Roch]] (nowadays notable for [[Information technology|IT]] and the video game industry), a newer one has emerged in the {{ill|Boulevard Laurier|fr|boulevard Laurier}} area of [[Sainte-Foy, Quebec City|Sainte-Foy]], where a number of accounting and [[law firm]]s have moved since the 2000s. Other suburban places identified by the city for their potential are the Lebourgneuf area for private offices, as well as Estimauville Street where the [[Government of Canada]] already has many civil servants and where several city officials are expected to move in the 2020s.<ref name="cbd">{{Cite web |date=7 October 2018 |title=Où sera le centre-ville de Québec dans le futur? |url=https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1128103/centre-ville-futur-quebec-urbanisme |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181009212737/https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/1128103/centre-ville-futur-quebec-urbanisme |archive-date=9 October 2018 |access-date=9 October 2018 |website=Radio-Canada.ca |language=fr-ca}}</ref>

{{See also|List of events in Quebec City|Media in Quebec City}}

Quebec City is known for its [[Quebec Winter Carnival|Winter Carnival]], its [[Festival d'été de Québec|summer music festival]] and its [[Fete nationale du Québec|Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day]] celebrations.
The [[Jardin zoologique du Québec]], now closed, reopened in 2002 after extensive repairs before ultimately shutting permanently in 2006. It featured 750 specimens of 300 different species of animals. The zoo specialized in winged fauna and garden themes but also featured several species of mammals. While it emphasized Quebec's indigenous fauna, one of its main attractions was the Indo-Australian greenhouse, which initially cost $14 million to build.<ref>{{cite news |title=Abandoned zoo greenhouse faces demolition |url=https://qcna.qc.ca/news/abandoned-zoo-greenhouse-faces-demolition |access-date=28 September 2022 |work=QCNA EN |date=23 November 2021 |language=en}}</ref> It featured fauna and flora from regions surrounding the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref>{{cite web |title=2022 - The greenhouse of the former Quebec zoo will indeed be demolished, confirms the City - Actual News Magazine |url=https://actualnewsmagazine.com/english/the-greenhouse-of-the-former-quebec-zoo-will-indeed-be-demolished-confirms-the-city/ |access-date=28 September 2022 |language=tr |date=9 December 2021}}</ref>

[[Parc Aquarium du Québec]], which reopened in 2002 on a site overlooking the [[Saint Lawrence River]], features more than 10,000 specimens of mammals, reptiles, fish and other aquatic [[Wildlife of Canada|fauna of North America]] and the [[Arctic]]. [[Polar bear]]s and various species of [[Pinniped|seal]]s of the Arctic sector and the "Large Ocean", a large basin offering visitors a view from underneath, make up part of the aquarium's main attractions.

Québec City has a number of historic sites, art galleries and museums, including [[Citadelle of Quebec]], [[Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec]], [[Ursulines of Quebec]], and [[Musée de la civilisation]].

[[File:Parc de la Chute-Montmorency en juin.JPG|thumb|left|[[Montmorency Falls]] is a major waterfall in the city's east end.]]

Other tourist attractions include [[Montmorency Falls]], and, just outside the city limits, the [[Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré]], the [[Mont-Sainte-Anne]] ski resort, and the [[Ice Hotel (Québec)|Ice Hotel]].

==Attractions==
Given the mass of [[Cap Diamant]] and the presence of [[Citadelle of Quebec|la Citadelle]] atop it, overlooking the waters of the St. Lawrence River, [[Charles Dickens]] described Quebec City as the "[[Gibraltar]] of [[North America]]".<ref>{{citation| url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/quebec-city-in-the-war-of-1812| last=Marsh| first=James A.| title=Quebec City in the War of 1812| date=30 October 2014| encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia| publisher=Historica Canada| accessdate=26 March 2023}}</ref>

===Architecture===
{{Main|Architecture of Quebec City}}
[[File:Rue St Jean.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|The [[Ramparts of Quebec City|St. Jean (St. John) Gate]]]]

Much of the city's notable traditional architecture is located in [[Vieux-Québec]] (Old Quebec), within and below the [[Ramparts of Quebec City|fortifications]]. This area has a distinct European feel with its stone buildings and winding streets lined with shops and restaurants. Porte Saint-Louis and Porte Saint-Jean are the main gates through the walls from the modern section of downtown; the Kent Gate was a gift to the province from [[Queen Victoria]] and the foundation stone was laid by the Queen's daughter, [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise, Marchioness of Lorne]], on 11 June 1879.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hubbard |first=R.H. |url=https://archive.org/details/rideauhallillust00hubb/page/49 |title=Rideau Hall |publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press |year=1977 |isbn=978-0-7735-0310-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/rideauhallillust00hubb/page/49 49] |url-access=registration}}</ref> West of the walls are the [[Parliament Hill (Quebec City)|Parliament Hill]] area, and to the south the [[Plains of Abraham]].

The upper and lower town are linked by numerous stairs such as the ''Escalier « casse-cou »'' ("breakneck stairway") or the [[Old Quebec Funicular]] on the historic [[Rue du Petit-Champlain]], where many small boutiques are found. A small town square nearby, the Place Royale, now surrounded by picturesque stone buildings, is the site of [[Champlain]]'s founding of the city in 1608. On it is the [[Notre-Dame-des-Victoires, Quebec City|Notre-Dame-des-Victoires]] church. The [[Musée de la Civilisation]] is located nearby by the river.

Along with concrete high-rises such as [[Édifice Marie-Guyart]] and [[Hôtel Le Concorde|Le Concorde]] on parliament hill (see [[List of tallest buildings in Quebec City]]), the city's skyline is dominated by the massive [[Château Frontenac]] hotel, perched on top of Cap-Diamant. It was designed by architect [[Bruce Price]], as one of a series of [[Canada's railway hotels|"château" style hotels]] built for the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] company. The railway company sought to encourage luxury tourism and bring wealthy travellers to its trains.
Alongside the Château Frontenac is the [[Terrasse Dufferin]], a walkway along the edge of the cliff, offering views of the Saint Lawrence River. The terrace leads toward the nearby [[Plains of Abraham]], site of the battle in which the British took Quebec from France, and the [[Citadelle of Quebec]], a [[Canadian Forces]] installation and the [[Governor General of Canada|federal vice-regal secondary residence]]. The [[Parliament Building (Quebec)|Parliament Building]], the meeting place of the [[Parliament of Quebec]], is also near the [[Citadelle of Quebec|Citadelle]].

Near the Château Frontenac is [[Notre-Dame de Québec Cathedral]], mother church of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec]]. It is the first church in the [[New World]] to be raised to a [[basilica]] and is the [[primate (bishop)|primatial]] church of Canada. There are 37 [[List of National Historic Sites of Canada in Quebec City|National Historic Sites of Canada]] in Quebec City and its enclaves.<ref>The 37 sites in Quebec City are listed in the [https://archive.today/20120906071404/http://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/search-recherche_eng.aspx Directory of Federal Heritage Designations] as being located in Québec and the following boroughs/enclaves: Beauport, Cap-Rouge, Notre-Dame-des-Anges, Sainte-Foy and Wendake.</ref>

===Parks===
One of the most notable is [[The Battlefields Park]], which is home to 50 historical artillery pieces and the [[Plains of Abraham]]. The park offers views of the St. Lawrence River and has multiple historical structures and statues like the ''[[Joan of Arc]] on Horseback'' and a couple of [[Martello Towers]].<ref name="ville.quebec.qc.ca">{{Cite web |title=Ville de Québec – Parks and Gardens |url=http://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/EN/touristes/voir/attraits/parcs_jardins.aspx#tabs |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114083801/http://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/EN/touristes/voir/attraits/parcs_jardins.aspx#tabs |archive-date=14 November 2016 |access-date=14 November 2016 |website=www.ville.quebec.qc.ca}}</ref> Historically this was the site of the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] (1759), a decisive British victory in the [[Seven Years' War]] which ended French rule in what would become Canada, and the later [[Battle of Quebec (1775)]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]], where the British were able to hold onto its last stronghold in the Northern extent of its North American territory.

Other large and centrally located parks are [[Parc Victoria, Quebec|Parc Victoria]], Parc [[Maizerets]] and [[Cartier-Brébeuf National Historic Site]].
Quebec City's largest park is the {{ill|Parc Chauveau|fr|Parc Chauveau}}, which is crossed by the suburban section of the city-wide [[Saint-Charles River (Quebec City)|Saint-Charles River]] and is thus also part of the {{convert|31|km|abbr=on}} long Saint-Charles River's [[linear park]]. At Chauveau, activities such as [[canoeing]], fishing and [[cross-country skiing]] are offered depending on the season, in addition to an interior soccer stadium.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Le Parc Chauveau: la nature à ma portée! |url=https://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/docs/publications/277_publication_2_530.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304115853/http://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/docs/publications/277_publication_2_530.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=6 October 2018 |publisher=Ville de Québec |language=fr}}</ref> Among others, there is also the beach of Beauport Bay, as well as the Marais du Nord (north-end [[marsh]] land).

Quebec is the only large city in Canada along with [[Halifax, Nova Scotia|Halifax]] lacking a public [[greenhouse]]. Nonetheless, outside areas known for their public [[gardens]] or [[landscaping]] include:<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hogdson |first=Larry |date=8 September 2018 |title=Québec, toujours un désert botanique? |url=https://www.lesoleil.com/maison/horticulture/quebec-toujours-un-desert-botanique-902ac285ddcced46037a826d41aa4b23 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006234927/https://www.lesoleil.com/maison/horticulture/quebec-toujours-un-desert-botanique-902ac285ddcced46037a826d41aa4b23 |archive-date=6 October 2018 |access-date=6 October 2018 |website=Le Soleil |language=fr-CA}}</ref>

The historical significance of the park also lies in the former presence of the viceregal [[Government House (Quebec)|Government House of Quebec]] (1845–1966).
* The [[Maizerets#Domaine de Maizerets|Domaine de Maizerets]], where are found an [[arboretum]] and an [[observation tower]], not far from the Saint Lawrence River and Beauport Bay.

The city currently has one professional team, the baseball team [[Quebec Capitales|Capitales de Québec]], which plays in the [[Frontier League]] in downtown's [[Stade Canac]]. The team was established in 1999 and originally played in the [[Northern League (baseball, 1993–2010)|Northern League]].

The city had a professional ice hockey team, the [[Quebec Nordiques]], which played in the [[World Hockey Association]] (WHA) from 1972 to 1979 and the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) from 1979 to 1995, maintaining a strong rivalry with the [[Montreal Canadiens]]. Due to a disadvantageous exchange rate with respect to the US dollar, the team moved to [[Denver, Colorado]], in 1995, becoming the [[Colorado Avalanche]].

The reasons for this remain unclear.<ref name="duval" /> Another researcher put forward the historical factors that led to Montreal surpassing Quebec as the metropolis of [[British North America]] in the early 19th century. According to this theory, its permanent status of "second city" (albeit the capital) engendered feelings of "repressed jealousy".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lachance |first=Nicolas |date=20 December 2015 |title=Il perce (enfin) le mystère Québec |url=https://www.journaldequebec.com/2015/12/20/il-perce-enfin-le-mystere-quebec |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010011006/https://www.journaldequebec.com/2015/12/20/il-perce-enfin-le-mystere-quebec |archive-date=10 October 2018 |access-date=8 October 2018 |website=Le Journal de Québec |language=fr-CA}}</ref>

The "mystery" was relativized following the [[2011 Canadian federal election|2011 federal election]]. All five ridings within the city were won by the leftist [[New Democratic Party]], in the so-called "orange wave" that temporarily swept the province. Nonetheless, five of the six seats won by the Conservatives in the province were found in the greater Quebec City area.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Séguin |first=Rheal |date=2 May 2011 |title=Quebec City gives NDP control over the region |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/quebec-city-gives-ndp-control-over-the-region/article578479/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028235554/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/pf/dist/components/output-types/default.css?d=95 |archive-date=28 October 2021 |access-date=8 October 2018 |website=The Globe and Mail}}</ref> At the [[2018 Quebec general election|2018 provincial election]], the leftist party [[Québec solidaire]] managed to win two districts, [[Taschereau (electoral district)|Taschereau]] and [[Jean-Lesage]], the most densely populated in town, but the centre-right CAQ, as it swept the province, won six of the nine districts encompassing the city, and 15 of the 18 in the administrative regions of [[Capitale-Nationale]] and [[Chaudière-Appalaches]] (south shore of the city).

{{Further|List of presidents of districts of Quebec City}}

===Municipal government===
[[File:City Hall in Quebec City.jpg|thumb|[[City Hall of Quebec City|Quebec City Hall]] serves as the seat for the [[Quebec City Council]].]]

Quebec City is governed by a [[mayor–council government]], which includes the 21 [[single-member district]]s of the legislative [[Quebec City Council]] and the separately elected [[List of mayors of Quebec City|mayor]]. The [[councilors]] are elected by [[first-past-the-post voting]] while the mayor is elected by the city [[at-large]]. Both usually belong to [[political parties]] and are elected at the same time every 4 years. The mayor is an [[ex officio member]] of the council but is not its president and has no vote. The current one is [[Bruno Marchand]], elected in [[2021 Quebec City municipal election|2021]].

Each of the city's six boroughs has a council composed of 3 to 5 of the aforementioned councillors, depending on the size of its population. It has jurisdiction with matters such as local road maintenance, leisure, [[waste collection]], and small grants for community projects and others, but cannot tax or borrow money.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Conseils d'arrondissement |url=https://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/apropos/gouvernance/conseils-arrondissement/index.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006105250/http://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/apropos/vie_democratique/elus/conseils_arrondissement/index.aspx |archive-date=6 October 2014 |website=Ville de Québec}}</ref> The boroughs are further divided into [[#Boroughs and neighbourhoods|35 neighbourhoods]], which also have councils devoted to [[public consultation]]s, each led by 11 citizens. Their geographical limits may be distinct from those of the city's 21 electoral districts, and councillors also sit at their neighbourhood councils as non-voting ex officio members.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Conseils de quartier |url=https://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/citoyens/participation-citoyenne/conseils_quartier/role-et-composition.aspx |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170308044912/http://www.ville.quebec.qc.ca/apropos/vie_democratique/participation_citoyenne/conseils_quartier/index.aspx |archive-date=8 March 2017 |website=Ville de Québec}}</ref>

Quebec City is an important hub in the province's [[Autoroutes of Quebec|autoroute]] system, as well as boasting one of the highest "expressway lane kilometres per 1000 persons" in the country (1.10&nbsp;km), behind [[Calgary]] (1.74), [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] (1.61) and [[Edmonton]] (1.24).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2004 |title=Projet de prolongement de l'axe du Vallon |url=http://www.bape.gouv.qc.ca/sections/mandats/du_vallon/documents/DQ5-1.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329002416/http://www.bape.gouv.qc.ca/sections/mandats/du_vallon/documents/DQ5-1.pdf |archive-date=29 March 2018 |access-date=21 March 2017 |website=BAPE |page=2 |language=fr}}</ref> [[Quebec Autoroute 40|Autoroute 40]] connects the region with [[Montreal]] and [[Ottawa]] to the west and [[Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré, Quebec|Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré]] and the [[Charlevoix]] region to the east. [[Quebec Autoroute 20|Autoroute 20]] parallels the south shore of the St. Lawrence River, linking Quebec City with Montreal and [[Toronto]] to the west and [[Rivière-du-Loup]], [[Rimouski]], and the [[Maritime Provinces]] to the east. [[Quebec Autoroute 73|Autoroute 73]] provides a north–south link through the metropolitan area, linking it with [[Saint-Georges, Quebec|Saint-Georges]], the [[Beauce, Quebec|Beauce]] region, and Maine to the south and [[Saguenay, Quebec|Saguenay]] and the [[Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean|Lac-Saint-Jean]] region to the north.

Within the metropolitan region, Autoroutes 40, 73, and several spur routes link the city centre with its suburbs.

[[Quebec Autoroute 573|Autoroute 573 (Autoroute Henri-IV)]] connects the city with [[CFB Valcartier]]. [[Quebec Autoroute 740|Autoroute 740 (Autoroute Robert-Bourassa)]] serves as a north–south inner belt. [[Quebec Autoroute 440 (Quebec City)|Autoroute 440]] comprises two separate autoroutes to the west and east of the urban core. Originally meant to be connected by a tunnel under the city centre, the two sections are separated by a {{Convert|6|km|abbr=on}} gap. There are no current plans to connect them. The western section (Autoroute Charest) connects Autoroutes 40 and 73 with Boulevard Charest (a main east–west avenue) while the eastern section (Autoroute Dufferin-Montmorency) links the city centre with [[Beauport, Quebec City|Beauport]] and [[Montmorency Falls]].

===Public transport===
[[File:RTC Métrobus Québec City 14786209214.jpg|thumb|RTC's ''Métrobus'' is a six lines, higher frequency and capacity bus service.]]
[[File:Tram on Maple Avenue, Quebec City, QC, 1898.jpg|thumb|A tram in Quebec City in 1898]]

The [[Réseau de transport de la Capitale]] (RTC) is responsible for public transport in the region. The RTC operates a fleet of buses and has recently implemented articulated buses. The RTC is studying the return of a [[Quebec City Tramway|tramway]] system to help ease overcrowding on its busiest lines as well as attract new users to public transit. The two billion dollar revitalization project needs approval from higher levels of government since the city does not have the financial resources to fund such an ambitious project on its own. As of 2022, the project named Quebec City Tramway is under development.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/tramway-quebec-city-approved-1.6410943 |title=Quebec City tramway finally gets green light as province gives unconditional approval |publisher=CBC |date=6 April 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportaction.ca/topics/urban-transit/quebec-city-tramway-wins-provincial-backing/|title=We represent the interests of rail and bus passengers and advocate for public transport services in Canada.|date=April 28, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.railforthevalley.com/latest-news/zweisystem/quebec-city-tram-will-be-a-reality/|title=Quebec city Tram Will Be A Reality : Rail for the Valley|date=6 April 2022 }}</ref>

Rail transport is operated by [[Via Rail]] at the [[Gare du Palais]] ('Palace Station'). The station is the eastern terminus of the railway's main [[Quebec City-Windsor Corridor]]. An inter-city bus station, with connections to the provincial long-distance bus network, is adjacent to the train station, and is used by operators such as [[Orleans Express]] and [[Intercar]].

===Air and sea===
Quebec City is served by [[Québec City Jean Lesage International Airport|Jean Lesage International Airport]], located {{convert|13|km|abbr=on}} west of the city centre.

The [[Port of Quebec]] is a seaport on the St. Lawrence with facilities in the first, fifth and sixth boroughs.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Port of Quebec |url=http://www.portquebec.ca/index.php?lang=en_GR |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203072407/http://www.portquebec.ca/index.php?lang=en_GR |archive-date=3 February 2012 |access-date=24 June 2009}}</ref>
