'''El Tigre''' is a city of Anzoategui, a state located east of  Venezuela's capital city of Caracas.
Located in what is called the "Guanipa Mesa", a river (Tigre) runs across the city.
The average temperature is 79°F, all year around, and the annual average rainfall is 1,200mm.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{Cite web |url=http://www.ine.gov.ve/censo/fichascenso/tiro.asp?cod_entidad=3 |title=Primeros Resultados XIII Censo General de Población y Vivienda<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2007-10-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071103023902/http://www.ine.gov.ve/censo/fichascenso/tiro.asp?cod_entidad=3 |archive-date=2007-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One nearby tourist destination is the [[Chimire, Venezuela|Chimire Cliffs]].

El Tigre also is in full conurbation with the city of [[San Jose de Guanipa]] also known as '''El Tigrito''', capital of the [[Guanipa Municipality]] whose population according to data from the CNE is ''84,526 '' inhabitants. Both cities are basically one, whose population would be ''291,472 '' inhabitants.

Since the appointment of [[Orinoco Belt]] as one of the largest reserves of oil in the world, El Tigre has become one of the most important cities in Venezuela because it is very near or on the edge of this oil belt in Anzoategui state. Thus, El Tigre currently shows an increase in the establishment of companies of services to the oil industry that is constantly growing and have also been presented innumerable construction projects for new shopping malls, business buildings or towers and other works for the significant activation of tourism.

==History==
In the 1930s a large field of [[light crude oil]] was discovered near El Tigrito by the [[Mene Grande Oil Company]] (MGO), a subsidiary of [[Gulf Oil Corporation]].<ref name=El_Tigre>{{cite web | publisher=Noticiero Digital La Mesa Guanipa  | url=http://lamesadeguanipa.com.ve/inicio/el-tigre-historia-petroleo-y-desarrollo-del-og-1-al-puerto-de-las-mulas-y-de-alli-hacia-estados-unidos/  | author = Alexis Caroles | title = EL TIGRE: HISTORIA, PETROLEO Y DESARROLLO / DEL OG-1 AL PUERTO DE LAS MULAS Y DE ALLÍ HACIA ESTADOS UNIDOS | date =  2018-12-06 | access-date=2019-05-17|language=es}}</ref>  The Oficina No. 1 well, a wildcat well begun in 1933 and completed in 1937, established the highly productive Oficina Formation.<ref name="Hedberg">{{Cite journal|author=Hedberg, H.D.|author2= Sass, L.C.| author3= Funkhouser, H.J.|date=1947|title=Oil Fields of Greater Oficina Area Central Anzoategui, Venezuela|journal=AAPG Bulletin|volume=31| pages=2089–2169|issue=12| url=http://archives.datapages.com/data/bulletns/1944-48/data/pg/0031/0012/2050/2089.htm|doi=10.1306/3D933A94-16B1-11D7-8645000102C1865D}}</ref> The oil discovery led to the founding of El Tigre on February 23, 1933 when Mene Grande established their offices in Campo Oficina.  El Tigre quickly became a [[boomtown]].  The name "Oficina" (Office) was derived from the telegraph office in El Tigrito. Until the oil discovery, the area had been sparsely populated. By 1940 a road and an [[oil pipeline]] had been constructed to connect El Tigre with Puerto La Cruz.<ref name=El_Tigre/>  By 1946, 512 wells had been drilled, and the region had produced 127 million barrels of oil.<ref name="Hedberg"/>  The nearby oil company camp [[San Tomé, Venezuela|San Tomé]] was built near El Tigre as the main camp for Mene Grande.<ref name=Holl>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/hedberg-hollis.pdf|title= Biographical Memoir: Hollis Dow Hedberg (1903–1988)|author=G.
