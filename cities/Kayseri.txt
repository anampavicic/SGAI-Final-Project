'''Kayseri''' ({{IPA|tr|ˈkajseɾi}}) is a large [[List of cities in Turkey|city]] in [[Central Anatolia]], [[Turkey]], and the capital of [[Kayseri Province|Kayseri province]]. Historically known as [[Caesarea (Mazaca)|Caesarea]], it has been the historical capital of [[Cappadocia]] since ancient times. The Kayseri Metropolitan Municipality area is composed of five districts: the two central districts of [[Kocasinan]] and [[Melikgazi]], and since 2004, also outlying [[Hacılar]], [[İncesu, Kayseri|İncesu]], and [[Talas, Turkey|Talas]].

As of 31 December 2021, the province had a population of 1,434,357 of whom 1,175,886 live in the four urban districts, excluding [[İncesu, Kayseri|İncesu]] which is not conurbated (i.e. not contiguous, having a largely non-protected [[buffer zone]]).

Kayseri sits at the foot of [[Mount Erciyes]] ([[Turkish language|Turkish:]] Erciyes Dağı), a dormant volcano that reaches an altitude of {{convert|3,916|m|abbr=off}}, more than 1,500 metres above the city's mean altitude. It contains a number of historic monuments, particularly from the [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] period. Tourists often pass through Kayseri en route to the attractions of [[Cappadocia]] to the west.

Kayseri is served by [[Erkilet International Airport]] and is home to [[Erciyes University]].

== Etymology ==
Kayseri was originally called ''Mazaka'' or ''Mazaca'' ({{Langx|hy|Մաժաք|translit=Mažak'}}; according to [[Armenian People|Armenian]] tradition, it was founded by and named after Mishak)<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4236961|title=Two Stone Idols from Asia Minor at the University of Illinois|author=Olmstead, A. T.|year=1929|journal=Syria|volume=10|issue=4|pages=311–313|doi=10.3406/syria.1929.3413 |jstor=4236961 |access-date=30 June 2022|via=JSTOR}}</ref> and was known as such to the geographer [[Strabo]], during whose time it was the capital of the Roman province of [[Cappadocia]], known also as ''Eusebia at the Argaeus'' ({{Lang|grc|Εὐσέβεια ἡ πρὸς τῷ Ἀργαίῳ}} in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]), after [[Ariarathes V of Cappadocia|Ariarathes V Eusebes]], King of [[Kingdom of Cappadocia|Cappadocia]] (163–130 BC).

In 14 AD its name was changed by [[Archelaus of Cappadocia|Archelaus]] (d. 17 AD), the last King of Cappadocia (36 BC–14 AD) and a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] vassal, to "[[Caesarea (Mazaca)|Caesarea]] in [[Cappadocia]]" (to distinguish it from other cities with the name ''Caesarea'' in the Roman Empire) in honour of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] upon his death. This name was rendered as {{Lang|grc|Καισάρεια}} (''Kaisáreia'') in [[Koine Greek]], the dialect of the later [[Byzantine (Eastern Roman) Empire]], and it remained in use by the natives (nowadays known as [[Cappadocian Greek]]s, due to their spoken language, but then referred to as [[Rûm|Rum]] due to their previous Roman citizenship) until their [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|expulsion]] from Turkey in 1924. (Note that letter ''C'' in classical [[Latin]] was pronounced ''K.'' When the first Turks arrived in the region in 1080 AD, they adapted this pronunciation, which eventually became ''Kayseri'' in Turkish, remaining as such ever since.)<ref name = "place-names">{{cite book |url = http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&entry=t209.e3530 |title = Kayseri |access-date =2007-12-11 |last = Everett-Heath |first = John |year = 2005 |work = Concise Dictionary of World Place-Names |publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]}}</ref>

==History==

Kayseri experienced three golden ages. The first, dating to 2000 BC, was when the city formed a trade post between the [[ancient Assyrians|Assyrians]] and the [[Hittites]]. The second came under Roman rule (1st to 11th centuries). The third golden age was during the reign of the [[Seljuks]] (1178–1243), when the city was the second capital of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rum]]. The relatively short Seljuk period left a large number of historic landmarks including the [[Hunat Hatun Complex]], the [[Kilij Arslan II|Kiliç Arslan]] Mosque, the Ulu Camii ([[Grand Mosque of Kayseri|Grand Mosque]]) and the [[Gevher Nesibe]] Hastanesi (Hospital).

===Ancient history===
As '''Mazaca''' ({{langx|grc|Μάζακα}}),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0099.tlg001.perseus-grc1:12.2.7|title=Strabo, Geography, Book 12, chapter 2, section 7|website=Perseus.tufts.edu|access-date=30 June 2022}}</ref> the city served as the residence of the kings of [[Cappadocia]]. In ancient times, it was on the crossroads of the trade routes from [[Sinop, Turkey|Sinop]]e to the [[Euphrates]] and from the [[Persian Royal Road]] that extended from [[Sardis]] to [[Susa]] during the 200+ years of [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian]] rule. In [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, a similar route from [[Ephesus]] to the East also crossed the city.

[[Basil of Caesarea|St Basil]], one of the Cappadocian Fathers, established a large monastic complex, the Basileiad, in Caesarea Mazaca in the 4th century. Nothing remains of it today.

The city stood on a low spur on the north side of [[Mount Erciyes]] (''Mount Argaeus'' in ancient times). Very few traces of the ancient site now survive.

For more on the Roman and Byzantine eras see [[Caesarea (Mazaca)]].

The [[Arab]] general (and later the first [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Caliph]]) [[Muawiyah I|Muawiyah]] invaded [[Cappadocia]] and took Caesarea from the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] temporarily in 647.<ref>Ostrogorsky, George.

Within the walls lies the greater part of Kayseri, rebuilt between the 13th and 16th centuries. The city then fell to the [[Eretnids]] before finally becoming [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] in 1515. It was the centre of a sanjak called initially the [[Rum Eyalet]] (1515–1521) and then the [[Angora vilayet]] (founded as Bozok Eyalet, 1839–1923).

===Modern era===
[[File:Kayseri Milli Mücadele Müzesi 4991.jpg|thumb|Kayseri National War Museum (Former High School)]]
The Grand [[Bazaar]] dates from the latter part of the 1800s, but the adjacent [[caravanserai]] (where merchant traders gathered before forming a caravan) dates from around 1500. The town's older districts (which were filled with ornate mansion-houses mostly dating from the 18th and 19th centuries) were subjected to wholesale demolition starting in the 1970s.<ref name="virtualani">{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualani.org/kayseri-houses/index.htm |title=Armenian Architecture – VirtualANI – The Traditional Houses of Kayseri |website=Virtualani.org |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523214837/http://www.virtualani.org/kayseri-houses/index.htm |archive-date=2007-05-23}}</ref>

The building that hosted the Kayseri Lyceum was rearranged to host the [[Turkish Grand National Assembly]] during the [[Turkish War of Independence]] when the [[Greek army]] was advancing on [[Ankara]], the base of the Turkish National Movement.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Kayseri has a [[continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dsa'', [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Dc''). It experiences cold, snowy winters and hot, dry summers with cool nights. Precipitation occurs throughout the year, albeit with a marked decrease in late summer and early fall.

==Political structure==
[[File:Kayseri districts.png|thumb|300px|right|Metropolitan districts of Kayseri]]

The city of Kayseri consists of sixteen metropolitan districts: Akkışla, Bünyan, Develi, Felâhiye, Hacılar, İncesu, Kocasinan, Melikgâzi, Özvatan, Pınarbaşı, Sarıoğlan, Sarız, Talas, Tomarza, Yahyâlı, and Yeşilhisar.

== Demographics ==
18,907 Armenians lived in the city of Kayseri in 1914, representing 35% of the total population. Armenians, excluding those who had previously converted to Islam, were either massacred or exiled during the [[Armenian genocide]]. The city's Greek Orthodox inhabitants were deported from 1919 to 1921 as part of population exchange between the newly independent Turkish Republic and the Kingdom of Greece.

Inside the centre of Kayseri the most unmissable reminder of the past are the huge '''basalt walls''' that once enclosed the old city. Dating back to the sixth century and the reign of the Emperor Justinian, they have been repeatedly repaired, by the Seljuks, by the Ottomans and more recently by the current Turkish government.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |title=KAYSERİ |url=https://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/k/165-kayser-sp-1010179573.html |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref> In 2019 [[Kayseri Archaeology Museum]] moved from an outlying location to a new site inside the walls.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kvmgm.ktb.gov.tr/Eklenti/91447,kayseri-archaeology-museumpdf.pdf?0|title=Kayseri Archaeology Museum}}</ref>

The '''Grand Mosque''' (Ulu Cami) was started by the [[Danishmendids|Danişmend]] emir [[Melik Mehmed Gazi]] who is buried beside it although it was only completed by the Seljuks after his death.<ref name="auto"/>

There are many magnificent reminders of the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] supremacy in and around the walls as well as many much smaller '''kümbets''' (domed tombs) of which the most impressive is the '''Döner Kümbet''' (Revolving Tomb). The oldest surviving Seljuk place of worship – and the oldest Seljuk mosque built in Turkey – is the [[Hunat Hatun Complex|Hunat Hatun Mosque complex]] which still includes a functioning hamam with separate sections for men and women dating back to 1238.<ref name="auto"/>

Near the mosque is the '''Sahabiye Medresesi''', a theological school dating back to 1267 with a magnificent portal typical of Seljuk architecture.<ref name="auto"/> Very similar is the '''Avgunlu (Havuzlu)''' '''Medresesi''' which now serves as a large bookshop-cum-cafe in a park.
[[File:Gevher Nesibe Medrese (Cifte Medrese) DSCF0762.jpg|thumb|Gevher Nesibe Medrese (Cifte Medrese)]]
In Mimar Sinan Park stands the '''Çifte Medresesi''', a pair of Seljuk-era theological schools that eventually served as a hospital for those with psychiatric disorders. They were commissioned by the Seljuk sultan [[Gıyaseddin Keyhüsrev I|Giyasettin I Keyhüsrev]] and his sister, Gevher Nesibe Sultan, who is buried inside. Today the buildings house the '''Museum of Seljuk Civilisations.'''<ref name="auto"/><ref>{{Cite web |title=Museum of Seljuk Civilisation {{!}} Kayseri, Turkey {{!}} Attractions – Lonely Planet |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/turkey/cappadocia-kapadokya/kayseri/attractions/museum-of-seljuk-civilisation/a/poi-sig/1082092/360876 |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=www.lonelyplanet.com |language=en}}</ref>

Another Seljuk survivor is the grand '''Halikılıç Mosque''' complex which has two spectacular entrance portals. It dates back to 1249 but was extensively restored three centuries later.<ref name="auto"/>

Post-dating the Seljuks is the '''Güpgüpoğlu Mansion''' which dates back to the early 15th century but is open to the public with the furnishings it would have had in the late 19th century when it was home to the poet and politician Ahmed Midhad Güpgüpoğlu.<ref name="auto"/>

Close to the walls is Kayseri's own '''Kapalı Çarşı''' (Covered Market), still a bustling commercial centre selling cheap clothes, shoes and much else. Deep inside it is the older and very atmospheric '''Vezir Han''' which was commissioned in the early 18th century by [[Nevşehir]]-born [[Damat Ibrahim Pasha|Damad İbrahim Paşa]] who became a grand vizier to [[Ahmed III|Sultan Ahmed III]] before being assassinated in 1730.<ref name="auto"/>

=== Around Kayseri ===
The Kayseri suburb of [[Talas, Turkey|Talas]] was the ancestral home of [[Calouste Gulbenkian]], [[Aristotle Onassis]] and [[Elia Kazan]]. Once ruinous following the expulsion of its Armenian population in 1915 and then of its Greek population in 1923, it was largely reconstructed in the early 21st century. The Greek Orthodox Church of St Mary, built in 1888, has been converted into the Yaman Dede Mosque.<ref>{{Cite web |title=TALAS |url=https://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/k/42-places-to-go/649-talas.html |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref> Similarly attractive is the suburb of '''Germir''', home to three 19th-century churches and many fine old stone houses.<ref>{{Cite web |title=GERMİR |url=https://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/g/650-germr.html |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref>

[[Mount Erciyes]] (Erciyes Dağı) looms over Kayseri and serves as a [[Backpacking (wilderness)|trekking]] and [[alpinism]] centre. During the 2010s an erstwhile small, local ski resort was developed into more of an international attraction with big-name hotels and facilities suitable for all sorts of winter pastimes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Erciyes Ski Resort |url=https://www.kayserierciyes.com.tr/ |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=www.kayserierciyes.com.tr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=ERCİYES DAĞI (MT ERCIYES) |url=https://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/k/42-places-to-go/284-ercyes-dai-mt-erciyes.html |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref>

The archaeological site of Kanesh-[[Kültepe]], one of the oldest cities in [[Asia Minor]], is 20&nbsp;km northeast of Kayseri.<ref>{{Cite web |title=KÜLTEPE |url=https://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/k/42-places-to-go/646-kueltepe.html |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref>

[[Ağırnas]], a small town with many lovely old houses, was the birthplace in 1490 of the great [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] architect [[Mimar Sinan]], and a house traditionally associated with him is open to the public as a museum. Beneath it there is one of the 'underground cities' so typical of [[Cappadocia]]. The restored church of St Prokopius dates back to 1857 and serves as a cultural centre.<ref>{{Cite web |title=AĞIRNAS |url=https://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/k/42-places-to-go/627-airnas.html |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref>

The small town of [[Develi]] also contains some attractive old houses. The 19th-century Armenian Church of St Mary has been turned into the Aşağı Everek Cami (Lower Everek Mosque).<ref>{{Cite web |title=DEVELİ |url=https://www.turkeyfromtheinside.com/places-to-go/d/1107-develi.html |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=www.turkeyfromtheinside.com}}</ref>

Kayseri received notable public investments in the 1920s and 1930s. Sumer Textiles and Kayseri Tayyare Fabrikasi (an aeroplane manufacturer) were set up here in the post -[[Republic of Turkey|Republican Era]] with the help of German and particularly Russian experts. The latter manufactured the first aircraft "made in Turkey" in the 1940s. After the 1950s, the city suffered from a decrease in the amount of public investment. It was, however, during the same years that Kayseri businessmen and merchants transformed themselves into rural capitalists. Members of families such as [[Sabancı Holding|Sabancı]], Has, [[Dedeman Hotels|Dedeman]], [[Hattat Agricultural Machines|Hattat]], Kurmel, [[Hüsnü Özyeğin|Özyeğin]], Karamanlargil and [[Tuncay Özilhan|Özilhan]] started out as small-scale merchants in Kayseri before becoming prominent actors in the Turkish economy. Despite setting up their headquarters in cities such as [[Istanbul]] and [[Adana]], they often returned to Kayseri to invest.

Thanks to the economic liberalisation policies introduced in the 1980s, a new wave of merchants and industrialists from Kayseri joined their predecessors. Most of these new industrialists choose Kayseri as a base of their operations. As a consequence of better infrastructure, the city has achieved remarkable industrial growth since 2000, causing it to be described as one of Turkey's [[Anatolian Tigers]].<ref>{{cite web |author=ESI |title=Islamic Calvinists: Change and Conservatism in Central Anatolia |url=http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_document_id_69.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051210131230/http://www.esiweb.org/pdf/esi_document_id_69.pdf |archive-date=2005-12-10 |access-date=2005-09-19 |publisher=European Stability Initiative, [[Berlin]]}}</ref>

The pace of growth of the city was so fast that in 2004 the city applied to the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] for the most new manufacturing industries started in a single day: 139 factories. Kayseri also has emerged as one of the most successful furniture-making hub in Turkey earned more than a billion dollars in export revenues in 2007. Its environment is regarded as especially favourable for [[small and medium enterprises]].

[[List of free zones of Turkey|The Kayseri Free Zone]] established in 1998 now has more than 43 companies with an investment of 140 million dollars. The Zone's main business activities include production, trading, warehouse management, mounting and demounting, assembly-disassembly, merchandising, maintenance and repair, engineering workshops, office and workplace rental, packing-repacking, banking and insurance, leasing, labelling and exhibition facilities. Kayseri FTZ is one of the cheapest land free zones in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kayser.com.tr/en/nasil-yararlanilir.php |title=KAYSER -Kayseri Serbest Bölgesi |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20131205060848/http://www.kayser.com.tr/en/nasil-yararlanilir.php |archive-date=2013-12-05}}</ref>

Some social scientists traced this economic success to a modernist Islamic outlook referred to as "Islamic Calvinism" which they said had taken root in Kayseri.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&id=156&document_ID=69 |title=Chronology of all ESI publications – Reports – ESI |publisher=Esiweb.org |date=2005-09-19 |access-date=2012-08-13 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603224142/http://www.esiweb.org/index.php?lang=en&id=156&document_ID=69 |archive-date=2012-06-03 }}</ref>

The city is served by [[Erkilet International Airport]] (ASR) which is a short distance from the centre of Kayseri. It offers several flights a day to Istanbul.

Kayseri is connected to the rest of country by [[railway|rail]] services. There are four trains a day to [[Ankara]]. To the east there are two train routes, one to [[Kars]] and the other to [[Tatvan]] at the western end of [[Lake Van]].

As the city is located in central Turkey, road transportation is very efficient. It takes approximately three hours to reach Ankara, the same to the Mediterranean coast and 45 minutes to [[Cappadocia]]. A notable [[skiing|ski]] resort in winter and accessible for trekking in summer, Mt Erciyes is 30 minutes from the city centre.

Within the city transportation largely relies on buses and private vehicles although there is also a [[light rail transit|light rail transit (LRT)]] system called [[Kayseray]]  which runs to the inter-city bus terminal and to Talas.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kayseri Ulaşım A.Ş. |url=https://www.kayseriulasim.com/ |access-date=2022-12-21 |website=Kayseri Ulaşım A.Ş. |language=tr}}</ref>

==Sports==
[[File:Kadir Has Kongre ve Spor Merkezi Kayseri.jpg|220px|thumb|right|[[Kadir Has Spor Salonu|Kadir Has Sports Arena]]]]

The city had two professional [[football (soccer)|football]] teams competing in top-flight [[Turkey|Turkish]] football. [[Kayserispor]] and [[Kayseri Erciyesspor]] simultaneously play in the [[Süper Lig]], making Kayseri one of only two cities having more than one team in [[2013–14 Süper Lig|Spor Toto Süper Lig 2013–14]] (the other being [[Istanbul]]). In 2006 Kayserispor became the only Turkish team to have won the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]]. Kayserispor is the remaining professional team in the city, playing in the top flight as of 2023.

The [[Erciyes Ski Resort]] on [[Mount Erciyes]] is one of the largest [[ski resort]]s in Turkey.

The women's football club [[Kayseri Gençler Birliği]] was promoted to the [[Turkish Women's Football Super League|Women's First League]] for the [[2020-21 Turkish Women's First Football League|2020–21 League]] season.<ref name="tff1"/>

Completed in early 2009, the [[all-seater stadium]] has a capacity of 33,000 spectators and is totally covered. It is shared by the two Kayseri football clubs. The stadium and surrounding sports complex are served by the light-rail system, [[Kayseray]]. The stadium was inaugurated with a [[Kayserispor]] – [[Fenerbahçe S.K. (football team)|Fenerbahce]] league match. Kadir Has Stadium was one of eight host stadiums for the [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. It hosted the opening ceremony and the opening match between [[Cuba]] and the [[Republic of Korea]].
*'''[[Kadir Has Spor Salonu|Kadir Has Sports Arena]]''' is an indoor arena opened in 2008. It has [[seating capacity]] for 7,200 people.
