'''Tarnów''' ({{IPA|pl|ˈtarnuf|-|Pl-Tarnów.ogg}}) is a city in southeastern [[Poland]] with 105,922 inhabitants<ref name="population" /> and a metropolitan area population of 269,000 inhabitants. The city is situated in the [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship]]. It is a major rail junction, located on the strategic east–west connection from [[Lviv]] to [[Kraków]], and two additional lines, one of which links the city with the [[Slovakia|Slovak]] border.

Tarnów is known for its traditional [[architecture of Poland|Polish architecture]], which was influenced by foreign cultures and foreigners that once lived in the area, most notably [[Jews]], [[Germans]] and [[Austrians]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.it.tarnow.pl/index.php/eng/Worth-seeing/Tarnow|title=Tarnów / Worth seeing / Tarnow and region – Tourist Information – Polski Biegun Ciepła * Polish Hot-Spot|first=Krzysztof|last=Gzyl|website=www.it.tarnow.pl|access-date=9 November 2017}}</ref> The Old Town, featuring 16th century [[tenements]], houses and defensive walls, has been preserved.

{{see also|Names of Tarnów in different languages}}
The first documented mention of the settlement dates back to 1105, spelled as ''Tharnow''. The name later evolved to ''Tarnowo'' (1229), ''Tarnów'' (1327), and ''Tharnow'' (1473).<ref name="Kalendarium"/> The [[place name]] Tarnów is widely used in different forms across [[Slavic Europe]], and lands which used to be inhabited by [[Slavs]], such as eastern [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], and northern [[Greece]]. There is a German town, [[Tarnow, Germany|Tarnow]], Greek [[Tyrnavos]] (also spelled as Tirnovo), Czech [[Trnov]], Bulgarian [[Veliko Tarnovo]] and [[Malko Tarnovo]], as well as different Trnovos/Trnowos in [[Slovenia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Serbia]], [[Bosnia]], and [[North Macedonia]]. The name ''Tarnów'' comes from an early Slavic word ''trn/tarn'', which means "thorn", or an area covered by thorny plants.

==History==
Already in the mid-9th century, on the Tarnów's St. Martin Mount (Góra sw. Marcina, 2.5 kilometers from the centre of today's city), a [[Slavs|Slavic]] [[Gord (archaeology)|gord]] was established, probably by the [[Vistulans]]. Due to efforts of local archaeologists, we know that the size of the gord was almost 16 [[hectare]]s, and it was surrounded by a [[Defensive wall|rampart]]. The settlement was probably destroyed in the 1030s or the 1050s, during either a popular rebellion against Christianity (see [[Baptism of Poland]]), or Czech invasion of [[Lesser Poland]]. In the mid-11th century, a new gord was established on the Biała river. It was a royal property, which in the late 11th or early 12th century was handed over to the [[Tyniec]] [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] Abbey. The name Tarnów, with a different spelling, was for the first time mentioned in a document of [[Papal legate]], Cardinal [[Gilles de Paris (bishop)|Gilles de Paris]] (1124).<ref name="Kalendarium"/>

The first documented mention of Tarnów occurs in the year 1309, when a list of miracles of [[Kinga of Poland]] specifies a woman named Marta, who was resident of the settlement. In 1327, a knight named Spicymir ([[Leliwa coat of arms]]) purchased a village of Tarnów Wielki, and three years later, founded his own [[private town]]. On 7 March 1330, King [[Władysław I the Elbow-high]] granted [[Magdeburg rights]] to Tarnów. One year later, construction of a castle on the St. Martin Hill was completed by [[Castellan of Kraków]], [[Spycimir Leliwita]] of [[Leliwa coat of arms]] (its ruins can still be seen).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://medievalheritage.eu/en/main-page/heritage/poland/tarnow-castle/ |title=Tarnów - Castle |website=medievalheritage.eu |access-date=26 May 2023}}</ref>

Tarnów remained in the hands of the Leliwa family, out of which in the 15th century the [[Tarnowski family]] emerged. In the 14th century, numerous [[Germans|German]] settlers immigrated from [[Kraków]] and [[Nowy Sącz]] (see [[Walddeutsche]], [[Ostsiedlung]]). During the 17th century [[Scottish people|Scottish]] immigrants began to come in large numbers. In 1528 the exiled [[King of Hungary]] [[János Szapolyai]] lived in the town.<ref>Zdzisław Spieralski, Jan Tarnowski 1488–1561, Warszawa 1977, pp. 124–125.</ref> The town prospered during the [[Polish Golden Age]], when it belonged to [[Hetman]] [[Jan Tarnowski]] (1488–1561). In the mid-16th century, its population was app. 1,200, with 200 houses located within town's [[defensive wall]] (the wall itself had been built in the mid-15th century, and expanded in the early 16th century). In 1467, the waterworks and sewage systems were completed, with large cisterns filled with drinking water built in the main market square. In the 16th century, during the period known as the [[Polish Golden Age]], Tarnów had a school, a synagogue, a [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] prayer house, Roman Catholic churches, and up to twelve [[guild]]s.

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===

Knight|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.22407}}</ref>]]After the death of Jan Tarnowski (16 May 1561), [[Italy|Italian]] sculptor Jan Maria Padovano began creating one of the most beautiful examples of [[Renaissance]] [[headstone]]s in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The monument of hetman Tarnowski is almost 14 meters tall, and stands in St. Anne Chapel, which is located in northern [[nave]] of the Tarnów Cathedral. Padovano completed his work in 1573; furthermore, he designed the Renaissance town hall, and oversaw its remodelling in the 1560s. At that time, in 28 [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] of the town hall were portraits of members of the [[Tarnowski family]] – from Spicymir Leliwita to [[Jan Krzysztof Tarnowski]], who died in 1567. In 1570 Tarnów became property of the [[Ostrogski family]], after [[Zofia Tarnowska]], the daughter of the hetman, married prince [[Konstanty Wasyl Ostrogski]]. In 1588, after Konstanty's death, the town changed hands several times, belonging to different families, which slowed its development. Until the [[Partitions of Poland]], Tarnów belonged to the County of [[Pilzno]], [[Sandomierz Voivodeship]]. The town, like almost all locations of Lesser Poland, was devastated in October 1655, during the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasion of Poland]], and as a result, its population declined from 2,000 to 768. In 1723, the town became the property of the [[Sanguszko family]], which purchased it from the [[Lubomirski family]].

===Habsburg Empire===
[[File:Rynek i ratusz w Tarnowie - Zygmunt Vogel.jpg|thumb|right|Market Square in Tarnów in 1800, painting by [[Zygmunt Vogel]]]]
After the [[first partition of Poland]] (1772), Tarnów was annexed by the [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg Empire]], and remained in Austrian [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] until late 1918. Austrian subjugation brought changes, as the town ceased to be private property, became the seat of a county (German: kreis), and of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarnów]] (1783). On 14 March 1794, [[Józef Bem]] was born in Tarnów. In the 1830s, under the influence of events in [[Congress Poland]] (see [[November Uprising]]), Tarnów emerged as a center of Polish conspiratorial organizations. Plans for a national uprising in Galicia failed in early 1846, when local peasants began murdering the nobility in the [[Galician slaughter]]. The massacre, led by [[Jakub Szela]] (born in [[Smarżowa]]), began on 18 February 1846. Szela's peasant units surrounded and attacked manor houses and settlements located in three counties – [[Sanok]], [[Jasło]], and Tarnów. According to Austrians, the revolt got out of hand and the Austrians had to put it down as they were subjugating a previously free people.

Tarnów went through the period of quick development in the second half of the 19th century, due to the program of construction of the railway system. In 1852, the town received rail connection with [[Kraków]], due to the [[Galician Railway of Archduke Charles Louis]], and in 1870, its population was 21,779. In 1878, [[gas lighting]] was introduced, and three years later, the first daily newspaper appeared. In 1888, the Diocese Museum was founded by Rev. Jozef Baba, and in 1910, Tarnów received modern waterworks, a power plant and a new complex of the main rail station. The city remained a hotspot of Polish conspirational activities, with up to 20% of all members of the [[Polish Legions in World War I]] coming from Tarnów and its area. On 10 November 1914, units of the [[Russian Imperial Army]] captured Tarnów, and remained in the city until 6 May 1915 (see [[Gorlice–Tarnów Offensive]]). In the early stages of the offensive, Tarnów was shelled by German-Austrian heavy artillery, which brought destruction to some of its districts.

===Second Polish Republic===

[[File:Landscape plan of the city of Tarnow, 1931.jpg|thumb|Landscape plan of the city of Tarnow, 1931.]]
Tarnów was one of the first Polish cities to be freed during the rebirth of Poland following World War I. The Polish Legions liberated the city on the night of 30–31 October 1918. In the [[Second Polish Republic]], Tarnów belonged to [[Kraków Voivodeship (1919–1939)|Kraków Voivodeship]], and gave the newly established country many outstanding figures, such as [[Franciszek Latinik]] and [[Wincenty Witos]]. In early 1927, construction of a large chemical plant was initiated in the suburban village of {{ill|Świerczków|pl|Świerczków|vertical-align=sup}}, which is now a part of the industrial borough of [[Mościce]], a district of the city. Before the outbreak of [[World War II]], the population of Tarnów was 40,000, of which almost half were Jewish. On 28 August 1939, a German Nazi saboteur conducted the [[Tarnów rail station bomb attack]] killing 20 civilians and wounding 35, four days before the [[invasion of Poland]] by [[Nazi Germany]] and the outbreak of [[World War II]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.it.tarnow.pl/index.php/pol/Atrakcje/TARNOW/Ciekawostki/Taka-jest-historia/Zamach-bombowy-na-tarnowskim-dworcu-kolejowym |trans-title=Zamach bombowy na tarnowskim dworcu kolejowym |work=Taka jest historia |publisher=Tarnów i region at it.tarnow.pl |author=Krzysztof Gzyl |title=Bombing attack at the train station in Tarnów |year=2018 |language=pl}}</ref>

During the German invasion of Poland, the city was overrun by the [[Wehrmacht|German forces]] on 7 September 1939. Under [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German occupation]], Tarnów was incorporated into the [[General Government]] territory as the seat of the ''Kreishauptmanschaft Tarnow'' administrative unit in the [[Kraków District]] on 26 October 1939.

In September 1939, the ''[[Einsatzgruppen|Einsatzgruppe I]]'' entered the city to commit [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|atrocities against Poles]], and the ''Einsatzgruppe zbV'' entered to take over the Polish industry.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wardzyńska|first=Maria|year=2009|title=Był rok 1939.

===Post-war period===
[[File:Budynek Teatru im. Ludwika Solskiego w Tarnowie.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ludwik Solski]] Theatre]]
A few months later, the Museum of Tarnów Land was opened, and Tarnów began a postwar recovery. In 1957, State Theatre of [[Ludwik Solski]] was opened. From 1975 to 1998, it was the capital of the [[Tarnów Voivodeship]].

===The Jews of Tarnów===
Before World War II, about 25,000 Jews lived in Tarnów.<ref name="ushmm.org-OTRS"/> Jews, whose recorded presence in the town went back to the mid-15th century, comprised about half of the town's total population. A large portion of Jewish business in Tarnów was devoted to garment and hat manufacturing. The Jewish community was ideologically diverse and included religious [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidim]], secular [[Zionism|Zionists]], and many more.<ref name="sztetl">[http://www.sztetl.org.pl/en/city/tarnow/ Jewish Community in Tarnów] on [[Virtual Shtetl]], the [[Museum of the History of Polish Jews]] in [[Warsaw]].</ref>

[[File:Jewish man humiliated and tortured by German policemen in Tarnów ghetto.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jewish men humiliated and tortured by German policemen]]
Immediately following the German occupation of the city on 8 September 1939, the persecution of the Jews began. German units burned down most of the city's synagogues on 9 September and drafted Jews for forced-labor projects.<ref name="ushmm.org-OTRS"/> Tarnów was incorporated into the [[General Government|Generalgouvernement]]. Many Tarnów Jews fled to the east, while a large influx of refugees from elsewhere in occupied Poland continued to increase the town's Jewish population. In early November, the Germans ordered the establishment of a Jewish council ([[Judenrat]]) to transmit orders and regulations to the Jewish community. Among the duties of the Jewish council were enforcement of special taxation on the community and providing workers for forced labor.<ref name="sztetl"/>

During 1941, life for the Jews of Tarnów became increasingly precarious.<ref name="ushmm.org-OTRS"/> The Germans imposed a large collective fine on the community. Jews were required to hand in their valuables. Roundups for labor became more frequent and killings became more commonplace and arbitrary. Deportations from Tarnów began in June 1942, when about 13,500 Jews were sent to the [[Belzec extermination camp]]. The first major act in the extermination of the Jews of Tarnów was the so-called "first operation" from 11–19 June 1942. The Germans gathered thousands of Jews in the Rynek (market place), and then they were tortured and killed. During this time period, on the streets of the town and in the Jewish cemetery, about 3,000 Jews were shot; in the woods of [[Zbylitowska Góra]] a few kilometers away from Tarnów a further 7,000 were murdered.<ref>[http://www.muzeum.tarnow.pl/judaica/przewodnik/baedeker.htm Adam Bartosz, In the footsteps of the Jews of Tarnów, 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302233705/http://www.muzeum.tarnow.pl/judaica/przewodnik/baedeker.htm |date=2 March 2012 }}</ref> According to a document from Michal Borawski born in 1926, featured at the entry of the Bimah as part of the panel offered by the Batory Foundation, the street stairs ("małe schody" or little stairs) from the town-center to the Bernardynski street (where the Bernardine Monastery is located), had to be cleaned of the blood by the local fire brigade for three days.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.batory.org.pl/en/about-us/ |title=Batory Foundation English homepage |publisher=Batory.org.pl |access-date=26 September 2013}}</ref> Poles gave shelter to several Jewish escapees from the ghetto, however, several Poles were eventually captured and murdered by the Germans for [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|rescuing Jews]].<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Rejestr faktów represji na obywatelach polskich za pomoc ludności żydowskiej w okresie II wojny światowej|year=2014|language=Polish|location=Warszawa|publisher=IPN|pages=344, 414, 419}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Datner|first=Szymon|year=1968|title=Las sprawiedliwych|language=Polish|location=Warszawa|publisher=Książka i Wiedza|page=50}}</ref> Many Poles were imprisoned by the Germans in the local prison for rescuing and helping Jews and then often deported to Auschwitz and other [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]], in which some died, while some fortunately survived until the end of the war.<ref>''Rejestr faktów represji na obywatelach polskich za pomoc ludności żydowskiej w okresie II wojny światowej'', pp. 212, 220, 238, 245, 251, 256, 274, 280, 308</ref>

After the June deportations, the Germans forced the surviving Jews of Tarnów, along with thousands of Jews from neighboring towns, into the new Tarnów Ghetto. The ghetto was surrounded by a high wooden fence. Living conditions in the ghetto were deplorable, marked by severe food shortages, a lack of sanitary facilities, and a forced-labor regimen in factories and workshops producing goods for the German war industry. In September 1942, the Germans ordered all ghetto residents to report to Targowica Square, where they were subjected to a 'selection' in which those deemed 'non-essential' were singled out for deportation to Belzec. About 8,000 people were deported. Thereafter, deportations from Tarnów to [[extermination camp]]s continued sporadically; the Germans deported a group of 2,500 in November 1942.<ref name="ushmm.org-OTRS"/>

====Holocaust resistance====
In the midst of the 1942 deportations, some Jews in Tarnów organized a [[Jewish resistance under Nazi rule|Jewish resistance movement]]. Many of the resistance leaders were young Zionists involved in the [[Hashomer Hatzair]] youth movement. Many of those who left the ghetto to join the partisans fighting in the forests later fell in battle with SS units. Other resisters sought to establish escape routes to Hungary, but with limited success. The Germans decided to destroy the Tarnów ghetto in September 1943. The surviving 10,000 Jews were deported, 7,000 of them to Auschwitz and 3,000 to the Plaszow concentration camp in Kraków. In late 1943, Tarnów was declared "free of Jews" (Judenrein). By the end of the war, the overwhelming majority of Tarnów Jews had been murdered by the Germans. Although 700 Jews returned in 1945, some of them soon left the city. Many moved to [[Israel]].<ref name="ushmm.org-OTRS">{{cite web|url=https://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005461 |title=Tarnow |publisher=Ushmm.org |at=[[OTRS]] Ticket |access-date=24 April 2013}}</ref>

===Property restoration===

====Our Lady of the Scapular====
The church of Our Lady of the Scapular in Tarnów was built on a plot that was illegally obtained by the [[parish]] from the descendants of Jewish [[Holocaust survivors]]. The plot, which belonged to a Goldman family, remained in the care of family friend Jerzy Poetschkes after Blanka Drillich (née Goldman), the last remnant of the family, left Poland after the war. In 1987 Poetchkes, with the advice of parish lawyers, claimed that the plot has been abandoned (i.e. the last owner is unknown, or had perished), despite being in contact with the Drillichs; he then sold half the plot and transferred the other half to the Church. In 2016, following a lengthy legal battle, a three judge panel found the Church had acted in bad faith and had no legal rights to the property. A year later the case was re-opened after the Church appealed to the local district attorney, with the personal involvement of [[Ministry of Justice (Poland)|Minister of Justice]] [[Zbigniew Ziobro]].<ref name="Guardian 2019-08-31">{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/aug/31/one-holocaust-descendants-fight-for-justice-they-stole-not-just-our-land-but-my-familys-history |title=One Holocaust descendant's fight for justice: 'They stole not just our land, but my family's history' |last=Szego |first=Julie |date=31 August 2019 |work=The Guardian |access-date=4 October 2019 |language=en-GB |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref name="Haaretz 2019-09-08">{{Cite news |url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/features/.premium.MAGAZINE-jewish-woman-who-discovered-a-church-was-built-on-her-family-land-wants-it-back-1.7808177 |title=A Church Was Built on Holocaust Survivor's Land in Poland.
