==History==
[[File:Territory of Panduranga.jpg|left|thumb|175x175px|Map of Panduranga polity with its centre Phan Rang]]{{Main|Panduranga (Champa)}}
[[Principality of Thuận Thành|The Cham principality of Panduranga]] had its center in Ninh Thuận province, but also included much of what is now [[Bình Thuận province]]. Panduranga became the political centre of Champa after the fall of [[Vijaya (Champa)|Vijaya]] in 1471. It remained independent until 1832, when emperor [[Minh Mạng]] annexed it. [[File:Province de Phan-Rang (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Phan Rang (Panduranga) province in 1909|175x175px]]
In 1901, Phan Rang province was established and then renamed Ninh Thuận. Ninh Thuận province was merged into [[Bình Thuận province]] in 1976, together with [[Bình Tuy province]], Ninh Thuận became a separate province again in 1991.

==Geography==
Ninh Thuận's topography is typical for the [[South Central Coast]] in that high mountains are located not only near the western border to the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]], but also near the coast, the highest of which is Chúa mountain ({{lang-vi|Núi Chúa}}) at {{convert|1040|m|ft}} in the north east of the province.<ref name=Atlas10>''Viet Nam Administrative Atlas''. Cartographic Publishing House, Hanoi 2010</ref> Several other peaks with heights up to {{convert|643|m|ft}}, including Đá Bạc mountain ({{lang-vi|Núi Đá Bạc}}) in the south, are located along the coast.<ref name=Atlas10/> The highest mountains are located at the borders to [[Khánh Hòa province]] and [[Lâm Đồng province]], with three mountains of over {{convert|1600|m|ft}} and the highest at {{convert|1652|m|ft}}, Sương Mù mountain ({{lang-vi|Núi Sương Mù}}).<ref name=Atlas10/> Only a small part of the province around [[Phan Rang]] has elevations of under {{convert|50|m|ft}}.<ref name=Atlat>''Atlat Dia li Viet Nam'' (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam). NXB Giao Duc, Hanoi: 2010</ref>  The province's major river is the [[Dinh River]], which flows through the main lowland of the province as well as Phan Rang. It has several tributaries in the province and is connected to Don Duong Lake in [[Lâm Đồng province]].<ref name=Atlas10/>

As of 2007, 55.7 per cent of Ninh Thuận's area was covered by forests, making it the most forested province of the South Central Coast.<ref name=GSO09>General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economical Statistical Data of 63 provinces and Cities''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> Forests cover most of [[Ninh Hải District]] at the coast in the north east, and most of the north and south west of the province. Ninh Thuận is Vietnam's most arid province, with some areas in the province receiving less than {{convert|800|mm|in}} of rain per year. There are reserves of [[molybdenum]] in the north of the province.<ref name=Atlat/>

==Demography==
Ninh Thuận had a population of 565,700 in 2009.<ref name=GSOpop/> Its urban population was 185,700 or 32.3% in 2007, a rapid increase from the 123,700 seven years ago. The urban population grew by an average 6% from 2000 to 2007, while the rural population actually had slightly negative growth. Overall population growth averaged 1.5%, which is the second highest in the [[South Central Coast]] after [[Da Nang]].<ref name="GSO09calc">calculations based on General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economical Statistical Data of 63 provinces and Cities''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref>

Apart from the [[Vietnamese people|Kinh]], significant parts of the province's population belong to the [[Cham people|Cham]] and [[Raglai people|Raglai]] ethnic groups. Many of the Cham live near the capital [[Phan Rang]] (Panduranga). The Raglai live in more remote parts of the province, such as the [[Ninh Hải District]] in the north-east and the mountainous regions in the west.

As of April 1, 2009, the province has 10 observed religions, with a total of 184 577 followers. In particular, there are 65,790 Catholics, followed by Buddhism with 43,192 people, Hindus 40,695 (the highest proportion in the country), Muslims 25,513, Protestants 7,570, and other minor religions. There are 1,784 people following Cao Dai, 26 people following Bahá'í , 5 people in  Hoa Hao Buddhism and the Pure Land Buddhist Association in Vietnam had one follower.<ref name="dstcdtvn">[http://www.gso.gov.vn/Modules/Doc_Download.aspx?DocID=12724 Kết quả toàn bộ Tổng điều tra Dân số và Nhà ở Việt Nam năm 2009], Tổng cục Thống kê Việt Nam.</ref>

==Economy==
Ninh Thuận is southern Vietnam's poorest and least industrialized province. Nominal per capita GDP was 6.66 million [[VND]] in 2007, half of the national average and 56% of the [[South Central Coast]]'s average of 10.8 million VND.<ref name=GSO09calc/> Ninh Thuận has also been the only province in the South Central Coast with an average annual GDP growth rate of less than 10% from 2000 to 2007 - at 9.4% compared to the region's average of 11.2%. While its industrial growth has been slightly above the region's average at 16.4%, it started from a very low base and therefore contributed little to overall growth. Growth in services has been at 9.8%, significantly below the region's average, while agriculture, forestry and fishing have grown at an average rate of 6.7%, somewhat higher than the average.<ref name=GSO09calc/>

===Agriculture, forestry, fishing===
Ninh Thuận's agriculture is mostly based on rice. 33,400 ha out of a total of 70,000 ha were used for the cultivation of rice, followed by maize with 14,200 ha.<ref name=GSO09/> 173,200 t of rice and 36,300 t of maize were harvested in 2007, accounting for 0.5% and 0.9% of national output.<ref name=GSO09calc/> The most important cash crop is [[tobacco]]. It is grown on 1,300 ha (as of 2007)<ref name=GSO09/> in the central part of the province west and north-east of [[Phan Rang]]<ref name=Atlat/> with an output of 3,300 t, or 10.3% of Vietnam's total output. The province also harvested 200 t in 2007, 1.2% of the national total.<ref name=GSO09calc/> Other less significant crops include cashew nuts, sugar-cane, peanuts, and coconuts.

Despite the large forests of the province, there is little commercial use of forest resources. [[Gross output]] of the forestry sector was 23.7 billion VND, accounting for only 1.8% of the South Central Coast, and therefore even less than [[Da Nang]].<ref name=GSO09calc/> Much of the province's forests are protected as part of [[Núi Chúa National Park]] and [[Phước Bình National Park]].  These National Parks as well as the nearby Vịnh Vĩnh Hy attracted the building of [[Amanoi]], a five star franchise hotel belonging to [[Aman Resorts]].

Ninh Thuận's fishing gross output was 1138.8 billion VND in 2007, 1.3% of Vietnam's output and therefore more significant in a national context than agriculture. It has grown at an average of 11.7%, far exceeding agricultural growth and making it one of the fastest growing sectors of the economy.<ref name=GSO09calc/> As of 2007, there were 589 offshore fishing vessels registered in the province.<ref name=GSO09/>

===Industry===
Ninh Thuận has a very small industrial sector, with a gross output accounting for only 2% of the South Central Coast's total. Industry contributes 1.3 million VND to the GDP per capita, compared to an average of 4.4 million VND for the region.<ref name=GSO09calc/>

The province's industrial products are mostly basic processed food and seafood products (frozen aquatic products, fish sauce, shelled cashew nuts) and processed raw materials (stones, bricks, salt). However, the industrial sector's growth of 16.4% has enabled it to absorb much of Ninh Thuận's labor force growth by increasing industrial employment from 14,900 in 2000 to 43,700 in 2007 - although this employment growth has been overshadowed by the service sector, which created 57,300 additional jobs in the same period despite its slower growth.<ref name=GSO09/>

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===
Ninh Thuận is located along Vietnam's main north-south corridors; therefore [[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|National Route 1]], [[North–South Expressway East]] as well as [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|North–South Railway]] run through the province. Ninh Thuận's main railway station is at [[Tháp Chàm Railway Station|Tháp Chàm]]. There are also two smaller railway station: Bà Râu in [[Thuận Bắc District]] in the north and Cà Ná near the southern border.<ref name=Atlas10/> [[Phan Rang]] is connected to [[Da Lat]] by National Road 27 via Ngoan Muc Pass. There used to be a [[Da Lat–Thap Cham Railway|railway]] serving the same route, but it has not been in use since the start of the Vietnam War.
[[File:Ga Thap Cham.jpg|thumb|200x200px|Tháp Chàm railway station]]

Ninh Thuận has three ports: 
* at Vịnh Vĩnh Hy in northeastern [[Ninh Hải District]]
* Ninh Chu Port in southern [[Ninh Hải District]] near [[Phan Rang]]
* Cà Ná Port in the south of the province

The nearest commercial airport is [[Cam Ranh International Airport]].
