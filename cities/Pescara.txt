The surrounding area was formed into the province of Pescara.

The main commercial street of the city is Corso Umberto I, which runs between two squares, starting from ''Piazza della Repubblica'' and reaching the seacoast in ''Piazza Primo Maggio''. The rectangle that it forms with Corso Vittorio Emanuele II and Via Nicola Fabrizi is home of the main shopping district, enclosed in a [[Road space rationing|driving restriction zone]], where several of the best fashion shops are located. Corso Manthoné, the course of the old Pescara, has, for many years, been the center of the nightlife of the city. City hall and the administration of the province are in Piazza Italia, near the river, and in the area between here and the [[D'Annunzio University of Chieti–Pescara|D'Annunzio University]] campus to the south, a business district has grown up over the years, while the [[Marina]] is situated to the immediate south of the mouth of the river. Pescara is also served by an international airport, the [[Abruzzo Airport]], and one of the major touristic ports of [[Adriatic Sea]] and Italy, the [[Port of Pescara]].

== Geography ==
Pescara is situated at sea level on the Adriatic coast and has developed from some centuries BC onwards at the strategic position around the mouth of the Aterno-Pescara River. The coast is low and sandy and the beach extends, unbroken for some distance to both the north and the south of the river, reaching a width of approximately {{convert|140|m|yd}} in the area around a ''pineta'' (a small pine forest) to the north. To the south the pine forest that once gave shade to bathers along much of the Adriatic coast, has almost disappeared near the beach, but remains within the [[Nature Reserve Pineta Dannunziana]].

The urban fabric of the city spreads over a flat T-shaped area, which occupies the valley around the river and the coastal strip. To the northwest and the southwest, the city is also expanding into the surrounding hills which were first occupied in the Neolithic period.

The whole city is affected by the presence of groundwater, the level of which varies by up to a metre, being at its highest in spring due to snow melting in the mountains inland.

The city is very close to the mountains, and the ski slopes of Passo Lanciano are a 30 minute drive away.

== Climate ==
Pescara has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Cfa) with [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] influences. The city's climate is characterized by hot summers and cool winters. Since its driest month has {{convert|34|mm|in|abbr=in}} of precipitation, the city cannot be solely classified as Mediterranean. Not to mention, although there is a dry tendency in early summer, August (late summer) is as wet as the winter month of February, which is unusual for the Mediterranean pattern.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.schweizerbart.de/resources/downloads/paper_free/55034.pdf |first1=Markus |last1=Kottek |first2=Jürgen |last2=Grieser |first3=Christoph |last3=Beck |first4=Bruno |last4=Rudolf |first5=Franz |last5=Rube |title=World Map of the Köppen-Geiger climate classification updated |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |date=June 2006 |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=259–263 |access-date=29 March 2013 |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130 |bibcode=2006MetZe..15..259K |archive-date=12 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190412021016/http://www.schweizerbart.de/resources/downloads/paper_free/55034.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.hydrol-earth-syst-sci-discuss.net/4/439/2007/hessd-4-439-2007.pdf |first1=M.

The average [[temperature]] is around {{convert|7|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the coldest month (January) and {{convert|24.5|°C|1|abbr=on}} in the warmest month (July). The lowest temperature recorded in the city was {{convert|-13|°C|0|abbr=on}} on 4 January 1979. The highest was registered on 30 August 2007 at {{convert|45|°C|0|abbr=on}}. [[Precipitation]] is low (around {{convert|676|mm|1|abbr=on}} per annum) and concentrated mainly in the late autumn.

Pescara is a coastal city, but its climate is influenced by the surrounding mountains (the [[Maiella National Park|Maiella]] and the chain of [[Gran Sasso d'Italia|Gran Sasso]]). When the wind is southwesterly, Pescara experiences a [[Foehn wind]] that often reaches {{convert|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}}, causing a sudden increase in temperature and decrease in relative humidity, and for that reason winters with temperatures that exceed {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} almost daily are not unknown. Pescara experiences 35 days annually with minimum temperature below {{convert|0|C|F|abbr=on}}.<ref name=WMOClino/>

Under northeasterly winds Pescara suffers precipitation which is generally weak, but can be much more intense if accompanied by a [[Extratropical cyclone|depression]]. Also from the north east comes winter weather from [[Siberia]] that, on average, brings abundant snowfalls every 3–4 years. In summer the weather is mostly stable and sunny with temperatures that, thanks to the sea breeze, rarely exceed 35 degrees unless a southwesterly [[Libeccio]] is blowing. Particularly in summer, but also in winter, the high humidity leads to morning and evening mist or haze.

== History ==
[[File:Pescara - corso Manthoné - 01.jpg|alt=|thumb|Old town]]
Pescara's origins precede the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] conquest. It was founded to be the port of [[Vestini]] and [[Marrucini]] [[Italic peoples|tribes]] to trade with the peoples of the Orient, a supporting role that was held for centuries. The name of both the town and the river was [[Aternum]], it was connected to Rome through the [[Via Valeria|Via Claudia Valeria]] and the [[Via Tiburtina]]. The main building was the temple of ''Jovis Aternium''. The town was an important port for trade with the [[Byzantine Empire|Eastern provinces]] of the Empire.

In the [[Middle Ages]] it was destroyed by the [[Lombards]] (597). [[Cetteus|Saint Cetteus]], the town's patron saint, was a [[bishop]] of the 6th century, elected to the see of [[Amiternum]] in [[Sabina (region)|Sabina]] (today the city of [[San Vittorino]]) in 590, during the pontificate of [[Pope Gregory I|Gregory the Great]].<ref name="santiebeati.it">{{Cite web |url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90550 |title=San Ceteo (Peregrinus) di Amiterno<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=1 August 2008 |archive-date=20 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220232024/http://santiebeati.it/dettaglio/90550 |url-status=live }}</ref>  His legend goes that he was executed by the Lombards at Amiternum by being thrown off a bridge with a stone tied around his neck; his body floated to Pescara.<ref name="santiebeati.it"/>[[File:Gabriele D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|right|The poet [[Gabriele D'Annunzio|Gabriele d'Annunzio]]]]In 1095 Pescara was a fishing village enriched with monuments and churches. In 1140 [[Roger II of Sicily|Roger of Sicily]] conquered the town, giving rise to a period in which it was destroyed by armies ravaging the [[Kingdom of Sicily]]. The name of ''Piscaria'' ("abounding with fish") is mentioned for the first time in this period. Several seignors ruled over Pescara afterwards, including [[Rainaldo Orsini]], [[Louis, Duke of Savoy|Louis of Savoy]], and [[Francesco del Borgo]], the vicar of king [[Ladislaus of Naples]], who had the fortress and the tower built. The subsequent rulers were the [[Ávalos|D'Avalos]]. In 1424 the famous [[condottiero]] [[Muzio Attendolo Sforza|Muzio Attendolo]] died here. Another adventurer, [[Jacopo Caldora]], conquered the town in 1435 and 1439. In the following years Pescara was repeatedly attacked by the [[Republic Venice|Venetians]], and later, as part of the Spanish [[Kingdom of Naples]], it was turned into a massive [[Fortification|fortress]].

In 1566 it was besieged by 105 [[Ottoman Empire|Turk]] [[galley]]s. It resisted fiercely and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] only managed to ravage the surrounding territory.

At the beginning of the 18th century Pescara had some 3,000 inhabitants, half of them living in Castellammare, a small [[frazione]] of the fortress. In 1707 it was attacked by [[Austria]]n troops under the command of the [[George Olivier, count of Wallis|Count of Wallis]]: the town, led by [[Giovanni Girolamo II Acquaviva]], resisted for two months before capitulating.
[[File:Palazzo del Governo Pescara.jpg|thumb|Government building, seat of the Province of Pescara]]
Pescara was always part of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], apart from the brief age of the [[Parthenopean Republic|Republic of Naples]] of 1798–99. The town was therefore attacked by the pro-[[Bourbon house|Bourbon]] [[Giuseppe Pronio]]. In 1800 Pescara fell to [[First French Empire|French]] troops, becoming an important military stronghold of [[Joseph Bonaparte]]'s reign. Castellammare, which now had 3,000 inhabitants of its own, became a separate municipality.

In 1814, Pescara's [[Carbonari|Carboneria]] revolted against [[Joachim Murat]]. There, on 15 May 1815, the king undersigned one of the first constitutions of the [[History of Italy|Italian]] [[Unification of Italy|Risorgimento]]. In the following years Pescara became a symbol of the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbon]]'s violent restoration as it housed one of the most notorious Bourbon jails. After a devastating flood in 1853, Pescara was liberated by [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s collaborator [[Clemente De Caesaris]] in 1860. Seven years later the fortress was dismantled.

In the sixty following years Pescara was included in the Province of [[Chieti]] and then merged with the adjacent town of Castellammare Adriatico and eventually became the largest city of its region. The new city suffered heavy civilian casualties when it was [[Bombing of Pescara in World War II|bombed by the Allies]] who were attempting to cut German supply lines during [[World War II]]. It has since been massively rebuilt, becoming a very modern coastal city of Italy.

The city is divided in two by the river in between.

The historic city center is located on the south shore, where once stood the Piazzaforte (fortified town), a military bulwark of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]]. There is the Bagno Borbonico (the old prison of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, built starting in 1510 by order of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], which incorporated inside the remains of the [[Normans|Norman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] city walls).
