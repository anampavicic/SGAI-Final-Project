[[File:Expansion of Iloilo City.png|thumb|left|The territorial expansion of Iloilo City.]]
Little is known historically about the region prior to the arrival of the Spanish. In ''Historia natural del sitio, fertilidad y calidad de las Islas e Indios de Bisayas'' (1668), the [[Jesuit]] missionary [[Francisco Ignacio Alcina]] (1668) identifies the origin of the [[Hiligaynon people]] of "Oton" ([[Panay]]) as the island of [[Leyte]], which correlates with the [[Bisayan languages|linguistic subgrouping]] of the [[Hiligaynon language]].<ref name="Zorc">{{cite book |last1=Zorc |first1=R.D. |editor1-first=Keith |editor1-last=Brown |editor2-first=Sarah |editor2-last=Ogilvie |title=Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World |date=2010 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780080877754 |page=492 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC&pg=PA492 |access-date=May 5, 2022 |archive-date=April 25, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240425112810/https://books.google.com/books?id=F2SRqDzB50wC&pg=PA492#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

Numerous legends however, exist on the origins of the [[Hiligaynon people]]. Among them is the epic ''[[Maragtas]]'' by Pedro Monteclaro (first published in 1907), which describes how ten ''[[datu]]'' and their families, led by Datu Puti, left the "kingdom of [[Borneo]]" to escape the cruel reign of Sultan Makatunaw. They arrived in the island of Panay and negotiated a sale of the lowlands with King Marikudo of the [[Ati people]]. The price is said to be a golden [[salakot]] for Marikudo and a long golden necklace for his queen, Maniwan-tiwan. A pact of friendship was then forged between the two peoples, and the Atis performed their native songs and dances, which is then said to be the origin of the [[Ati-Atihan Festival]]. According to Augustinian Friar Rev. Fr. Santaren recording in the Spanish era of this Pre-Spanish legendary history, that Datu Macatunao or Rajah Makatunao who was the "sultan of the Moros," and a relative of Datu Puti who seized the properties and riches of the ten datus was eventually killed by the warriors named Labaodungon and Paybare, after learning of this injustice from their father-in-law Paiburong (Datu of Iloilo), sailed to Odtojan in Borneo where Makatunaw ruled. The warriors sacked the city, killed Makatunaw and his family, retrieved the stolen properties of the 10 datus, enslaved the remaining population of Odtojan, and sailed back to Panay. Labaw Donggon and his wife, Ojaytanayon, later settled in a place called [[Dingle, Iloilo|Moroboro]].<ref name="Talaguit" /> The ''Maragtas'' also goes on to describe other settlements by "[[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] ''datu''" in other areas in the [[Visayas]] and [[Luzon]].<ref name="Scott"/><ref name="Duka"/>

While once widely accepted and included in school textbooks, ''Maragtas'' (as well as the [[Code of Kalantiaw]]) is now regarded by modern scholars to be an early 20th century [[hoax]]. The historicity of the epic was first challenged by the historian [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] in 1968.<ref name="Scott">{{cite book |last1=Scott |first1=William Henry |title=Prehispanic Source Materials for the Study of Philippine Histor |date=1968 |publisher=University of Santo Tomas Press |location=Manila |isbn=978-9711002275}}</ref> Scott successfully defended his criticism before a panel of experts in Filipino history (including [[Gregorio Zaide]], [[Teodoro Agoncillo]], etc.), some of whom had once promoted the inclusion of ''Maragtas'' in books on Philippine history.<ref name="Duka">{{cite book |last1=Duka |first1=Cecilio D. |title=Struggle for Freedom' 2008 Ed. |date=2008 |publisher=Rex Bookstore, Inc |isbn=9789712350450 |pages=21–23}}</ref>

Fr. Tomas Santaren. His account, ''Bisayan Accounts of Early Bornean Settlements'', was first published in 1902 as an appendix to the book ''Igorrotes: estudio geográfico y etnográfico sobre algunos distritos del norte de Luzon'' by Fr. Angel Perez. Santaren's account is allegedly a direct Spanish translation from two manuscripts acquired from locals in Iloilo sometime after 1858 when he was stationed there. The details on Santaren's account corroborate most of Monteclaro's. However, the manuscripts that Santaren translated from were presumably only written during the colonial era in romanized [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]], since pre-colonial Visayans transmitted history via oral tradition, not in writing. Thus it is still unlikely that they are of pre-colonial origin. It is, however, accurate to regard the ''Maragtas'' (or at least elements of it) as being derived from local folk history, rather than authentic history or simply fabrications by Monteclaro.<ref name="Talaguit"/><ref>Tomas Santaren, Bisayan Accounts of Early Bornean Settlements in the Philippines, trans by Enriqueta Fox, (Chicago: University of Chicago, Philippine Studies Program, 1954), ii.</ref>

In 1519, King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] already acquired and inherited Catholic kingdoms. He was the King of all Spain, [[Holy Roman Emperor|King of Germany]] and Holy Roman Emperor, [[Duke of Burgundy]] and [[Luxembourg]], [[Count of Holland]], [[Count of Barcelona]], [[Count of Flanders]], [[Prince of Asturias]], [[Archduke of Austria]], [[King of Aragon]], [[King of Jerusalem]],  Catalonia, Valencia, Naples, two Sicilies, Corsica and Sardinia. King of the Western and Eastern Indies, of the Islands and Mainland of the Ocean Sea. [[King of Italy]], [[King of Bohemia]] and Hungary. He commissioned Ferdinand Magellan to circumnavigate the globe especially to establish International Trade in Spice Island.

They disembark in unpopulated [[Homonhon Island]] for a week from a long journey for food and water and call the place "Buenas Senas" or good sign. They navigated through the Strait of Siargapo and at landed [[Limasawa Island]] and were received peacefully by locals. Delighted, the Spaniards planted a cross on a hill and the first mass was celebrated. It was the first Spanish settlement and the birthplace of Christianity in the Philippines. The locals were introduced to visit another kinsman chieftain along the [[Magallanes, Agusan del Norte|Butuan River]]. The King of [[Butuan]] received the Spaniards on April 8, 1521. Returning to Limasawa, The Prince of Limasawa also told them about 3 powerful [[Kedatuan]] – in Sugbu, Yrong-yrong and Tondo.  On March 17, 1521,  Magellan named the newly discovered Island as " Las islas de San Lázaro". By April 7, Magellan arrived in Sugbu. Datu Zula of Mactan sent Magellan 2 goats.

{{blockquote|text="''On Friday, April twenty-six, Zula, the second chief of the island of Mactan, sent one of his sons to present two goats to the captain-general, and to say that he would send him all that he had promised, but that he had not been able to send it to him because of the other chief Lapu-Lapu, who refused to obey the king of Spain.''"<ref name="Nowell 1962">{{cite book | last =Nowell | first =Charles E. | title =Magellan's Voyage Around the World: Three Contemporary Accounts | url =https://archive.org/details/magellansvoyage00pigagoog | publisher =Northwestern University Press | year =1962 }}</ref>}}

Magellan was hit by a poisoned arrow he turned toward his men who were returning to the ships and fell down. The next day, [[Rajah Humabon]] of Sugbu offered a Banquet for Spaniards. Twenty-seven Spanish sailors died due to poisoning by Cebuanos. Rajah Humabon restored friendly relations with Lapu-Lapu, as he is married to Hara Humamay, Lapu-lapu niece.

Under Philip II, in 1565, the Spaniards in Mexico returned to Cebu to avenge Magellan's death against the treachery of Cebuanos. [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] pillaged and burned houses in Cebu for days. Cebuanos retreated, fearing the heavily armored Spaniards now with formidable reformed-infantry called [[Tercios]] composed of [[Pike (weapon)|alabardero]], [[Ensign (rank)|alférez with a sword]] and [[arquebus|Arcabucero with gunpowder]].<ref>Scott, William Henry (1992) p. 48</ref> Miguel López de Legazpi directed [[Felipe de Salcedo]] along with Spanish Friar [[Martín de Rada]] and other Augustinian missionaries to look for food.

When the Spaniards came to the Visayas, they noted that the pirates among them were more terrifying than the Mohammedans of Jolo and Mindanao. All year long, after the harvest, they would sail toward faraway places to hunt slaves and make surprise attacks on settlements. Those who did not live along the rivers, would make their raids in the months of February, March, April, October and November, going deeper into the interior parts of the islands, sacking the villages. These raiding expeditions are called ''panggubat'' (noun) or ''manggubat'' (gerund verb form).<ref name="auto4">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye|title=Las islas Visayas en la epoca de la conquista|first=Isabelo de los|last=Reyes y Florentino|date=October 15, 1889|publisher=Manila: Tipo-litografia de Chofre y ca.|via=Internet Archive}}</ref>

In the early days of the Spanish period; the first Manila Galleons were originally constructed at the port of Oton to the west of Iloilo. Since there was no precedent in Spain for the immensity of a Manila-Galleon, it could be argued that the proto-type Manila galleons were of Visayan design since the Visayans were already constructing huge multi-masted 4 to 5 decked caracoas in their wars against the other kingdoms and thus, the technical know-how to construct the first Manila galleons was an amelioration of Visayan shipbuilding with Spanish shipbuilding. Oton built the first Manila galleons before operations were eventually transferred to the [[Bicol Region|Bicol]] and [[Cavite]] shipyards.

=== 1600s–1700s ===

In the year 1600, a large Muslim attack on Iloilo City was launched, with a force of 70 ships and 4,000 warriors, raiding and attacking several Visayan islands in order to abduct slaves. However, the attack was repulsed by a force of 1,000 Visayan warriors and 70 Mexican arquebusiers under the command of the Don Juan Garcia de Sierra (the Spanish ''alcalde mayor''), who died in battle.<ref>''Philippines: A Unique Nation'' By Dr. Sonia M.

In 1700, due to ever-increasing attacks especially from the Dutch and the Moros, the Spaniards again moved their seat of power some {{Convert|25|km|0|abbr=off}} eastward to the village of Irong-Irong, which had natural and strategic defense against raids.  At the mouth of the river that snakes through Panay, the Spaniards built the ''Fortificación de Nuestra Señora del Rosario en el Puerto de Yloylo, Provincia de Oton''<ref>''Planos de las Plazas, Presidios, y Fortificaciones en todo el Distrito de las Provincias, que sugeta al Real Dominio en las Yslas Philipinas: Relación de Artillería, Tren de manejo, Pertrechos de Guerra, Tropas regladas de Dotación: Raciones, y Municiones, con Liquidación, y Separación de su Importación en el Año: Producto de las Rentas y Consignaciones que se reporta segun el estado presente'', dated 1738 (Manuscript drawn by Order of the Field Marshall Don Fernando Valdes y Tamon, Governor of the Philippine Islands from 1729 to 1739.

Irong-Irong or Ilong-Ilong was shortened to Iloilo. Later, the natural port area quickly became the capital of the province.<ref name=monografias/>

=== Sugar boom era and the late Spanish colonial period (1800s) ===
[[File:Aduana de Iloilo (Iloilo Customs House).jpg|left|thumb|''Aduana de Iloilo'' ([[Iloilo Customs House]]) is the second-biggest customs house in the Philippines after the old Spanish ''Aduana'' (Intendencia) de [[Manila]] in [[Intramuros]] and the American era built [[Aduana Building|Aduana de Manila]] (Manila Customs House).]]
Spanish colonial local government in Iloilo allowed Chinese migrants which worked among the city's industries (the Locsin, Lopez, Jalandoni, Lim and Sy families) and [[Latin Americans]] from across the Pacific ([[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]) to man its military fortifications (the Araneta, De Rama and Arroyo families). In the late 18th century, the development of large-scale weaving industry started the movement of Iloilo's surge in trade and economy in the Visayas.

Sometimes referred to as the "Textile Capital of the Philippines",<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rafi.org.ph/news-highlights/visayan-textiles/|title=Visayan textiles – RAFI|access-date=October 29, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009194314/http://www.rafi.org.ph/news-highlights/visayan-textiles/|archive-date=October 9, 2014}}</ref> the products were exported to Manila and other foreign places. Sinamay, piña, and jusi are examples of the products produced by the looms of Iloilo. Because of the rise of the textile industry, there was also a rise of the upper middle class. However, with the introduction of cheap textile from the UK and the emergence of the sugar economy, the industry waned in the mid-19th century.

[[File:Mansion de Lopez (Lopez Heritage House or Nelly's Garden).jpg |thumb|Mansion de Lopez ([[Lopez Heritage House|Nelly's Garden]]), which is regaled as the "''Queen of all heritage houses in Iloilo''" and Panay, is one of the grand mansions in the heritage district of [[Jaro, Iloilo|Jaro]] that resulted from the sugar boom.]]
The waning textile industry was replaced, however, by the opening of Iloilo's port to the world market in 1855. Because of this, Iloilo's industry and agriculture was put on direct access to foreign markets. But what triggered the economic boom of Iloilo in the 19th century was the development of the sugar industry in Iloilo and its neighboring island of Negros. Sugar during the 19th century was of high demand. [[Nicholas Loney]], the British vice-consul in Iloilo, developed the industry by giving loans, constructing warehouses in the port, and introducing new technologies in sugar farming. The rich families of Iloilo developed large areas of [[Negros (Philippines)|Negros]], which were later called haciendas, because of sugar's high demand in the world market. Because of the increase in commercial activity, infrastructures, recreational facilities, educational institutions, banks, foreign consulates, commercial firms and much more sprouted in Iloilo.

=== The Revolutionary Period (1896) ===
{{further|Philippine Revolution}}

The immediate reaction of Ilonggo elite to the outbreak of the 1896 rebellion in Manila was that of surprise. They immediately responded with protestations of outrage and affirmed their loyalty to Spain. The Ilonggos themselves were united in their support of Spain during the first two years of the revolutionary period.<ref>Policarpio F. Hernandez, ''Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566–1898)'', p. 143.</ref>

Shortly after the ''Cry of Balintawak'', the Jaro Ayuntamiento (another colonial city adjacent to Iloilo City), composed of native Ilonggos,<ref>The members of the Jaro Ayuntamiento who signed the act of protestation against the uprising were: Mariano Villalobos, Tranquilino Gonzales, Severino Argüelles, Raimundo Escarilla, Vidal Jabelona, Ruperto Jalandoni, Esteban Jalandoni, Juan Ledesma, Pablo Ledesma, and León Jereos (Secretary). Cf. September 7, 1896, issue of ''El Porvenir de Bisayas''</ref> convened a special session on September 1, 1896, where the Manila uprising was condemned as an unpatriotic act "that finds no echo in the noble hearts of Jareños, who do not forget the immense gratitude they owe Spain who, from nothing, raised us to a life of civilization and progress."<ref>Policarpio F. Hernandez, ''Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566–1898)'', p. 144. The actual text of the letter of the members of the Jaro Ayuntamiento addressed to the Governor General of the Philippines (published in the September 7, 1896, issue of ''El Porvenir de Bisayas'') says: ''Estos hechos de sedición, doblemente criminales en las dolorosas circunstancias que afligen a la Patria común, que allá, al otro lado de los mares, en los Campos de Cuba, está vertiendo sin tasa la generosa sangre de sus leales hijos que otros hijos integrados la hacen derramar; no pueden levantar eco en los corazones nobles de los Jareños, que no olvidan la inmensa gratitud que deben a España que, de la nada... los hizos nacer a la vida de la civilización y del progreso.''</ref>

The Ayuntamiento of Iloilo<ref>The officials of the City of Iloilo who signed the letter of protestation were as follows: Victoriano Mapa (Primer Alcalde), Emilio Escay (Primer Teniente Alcalde), Arcadio Conde Otegui (Segundo Teniente Alcalde), Vanancio Conception, José María Aguilar, Félix de la Rama, Severino Durán, Eduardo Arjanuate, Francisco Aguado, Francisco Ortiz, Lorenzo Guevara, Ramón Roco, and Mariano Teaño - regidores. Cf. September 7, 1896, issue of ''El Porvenir de Bisayas''.</ref> also affirmed its allegiance and loyalty to Spain and made a similar protestation. Condemning the uprising, the city's letter to the Governor General says:

<blockquote>''"Those dark betrayals, the mere notion of which embarrasses good and loyal Filipinos, have produced a unanimous sentiment of protest and indignation among the Ilongo people, who engrave its most honorable blazon in the sacred and inextinguishable love that it professes to the glorious Spanish nationality that it legitimately feels proud of. The Ilongos are Spaniards, Your Excellency, and Spaniards will they be until death, because they do not want to live and die in another way than under the shadow of the august Castillan standard, to which they owe being dignified and free men now."<ref>''Esas negras traiciones, cuya sola idea avergüenza a los Filipinos buenos y leales, han producido un sentimiento unánime de protesta e indignación en el pueblo Ilongo, que cifra su más honroso blasón en el inextinguible y sacrosanto amor que profesa a la gloriosa nacionalidad española de que se siente legitimamente orgulloso. Españoles son los Ilongos, Ex.cmo. Señor, y españoles seran hasta la muerte, porque no quieren vivir ni morir de otro modo que a la sombra de la augusta enseña castillana, a la cual deben el ser hoy hombres dignos y libres.'' 7 September 1896 issue of ''El Porvenir de Bisayas''.</ref>''</blockquote>

The foreign community in the city also asked its representatives to visit local authorities and to elevate their protests against the revolt. And so did the Filipino parish priests of Jaro, Molo, Mandurriao, and Arévalo.<ref>Cf. September 3, 1896, issue of ''El Porvenir de Bisayas''. Also cf. Policarpio F. Hernadez, ''Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566–1898)'', p. 145.</ref> Towns in Iloilo province also condemned the Manila uprising, and those of the neighboring provinces of Cápiz and Antique, as well as the island of Negros, followed suit. This emboldened the Ilonggo elite to initiate the organization of volunteers to be sent to quell what was seen as a mostly-Tagalog rebellion. The move was backed by the Spanish and foreign communities of Iloilo.<ref>Cf. Policarpio F. Hernadez, ''Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566–1898)'', p. 145.</ref> A battalion of five hundred native volunteers was raised, which was divided into two companies, and placed under the cadre of mostly Spanish officers.<ref>Cf. December 30, 1896, issue of ''El Eco de Panay''. Also cf. Policarpio F. Hernadez, ''Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566–1898)'', pp. 145-146.</ref> They arrived in Manila on January 16, 1897.<ref>Cf. January 16, 1897, issue of ''Diario de Manila''.</ref> They were one of the largest native contingent to serve the government forces against Katipunan troops led by Emilio Aguinaldo, in the battlegrounds of Cavite province.<ref name="Policarpio F.

It is the fifth oldest and the last seminary established by Spaniards in the Philippines.]]

The Ilonggo volunteers established for themselves a distinguished combat record in Cavite. Once the [[Pact of Biak-na-Bato]] was signed, they returned to Iloilo. In April 1898 their homecoming, just like their departure, was met with much fanfare. This galvanized the Ilonggos into more public outpourings and manifestations of loyalty to Spain.<ref>Cf. April 26, 1898, issue of ''El Eco de Panay''. Cf. also Policarpio F. Hernadez, ''Iloilo, the Most Noble City: History and Development (1566–1898)'', p. 147.</ref>

Due to the loyalty of the Ilonggos, the city of Iloilo was honored with the perpetual<ref name="Policarpio F. Hernadez 1898 p. 147"/> title of ''Muy Noble'' (Most Noble). The Royal Decree granting this title was signed on March 1, 1898, by Queen Regent Maria Cristina.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|url=http://www.boe.es/datos/imagenes/BOE/1898/063/A00750.tif|title=TIF file|access-date=November 5, 2011|archive-date=February 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203175557/http://www.boe.es/datos/imagenes/BOE/1898/063/A00750.tif|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>"Queriendo dar una prueba de Mi Real aprecio á la ciudad de Ilo-Ilo por su honroso proceder con motivo de haber sido la primera que presentó voluntarios para combatir la insurrección de Filipinas; a propuesta del Ministro de Ultramar, de acuerdo con Mi Consejo de Ministros; En Nombre de Mi augusto Hijo el Rey D. Alfonso XIII, y como Reina Regente del Reino, vengo en conceder á dicha ciudad el dictado de "Muy Noble", como recompensa á su conducta y estimulo para el porvenir. Dado en Palacio á primero de Marzo de mil ocho-cientos noventa y ocho." These were the actual words (in Spanish) of the Royal Decree honoring the City with the title "Muy Noble" (Most Noble). ''Real Decreto de La Reina Regente Maria Cristina (Marzo 1, 1898)'' in ''Gaceta de Mardrid'', No. 63, 4 Marzo 1898, p. 750.</ref> Over time, this title earned for Iloilo City the reputation of it being the ''Queen's Favored City in the South'' or simply ''Queen's City in the South'', being the second Spanish port of importance next to Manila, and being located south of the archipelago's Capital. On a side note, at the beginning of the American period until the [[World War II|Second World War]], Cebu became the second port of importance (Iloilo having been partly ravaged by bombardment, fire, and riots during the American occupation of Iloilo City).

Yet, it was also during this period of Philippine history that Iloilo was more popularly known as the ''Queen City of the South''. This points to the fact that the moniker was associated with the Queen Regent's favor and with the honorary title granted to Iloilo City as ''La Muy Leal y Noble Ciudad'' (The Most Loyal and Noble City), due to the loyalty of its citizens to the Spanish Crown.<ref>Foreman, John, ''The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

After the defeat of the Spanish forces at the [[Battle of Manila Bay]] during the [[Spanish–American War]], the Capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]] was transferred to Iloilo, with General Diego de los Rios as the new Governor General residing in the city. A truce was declared between the American and the Spanish forces pending the negotiations of the joint commission of both warring Countries in Paris, France for the terms of peace. Meanwhile, General Aguinaldo sent several small vessels to Panay with Tagalog revolutionaries in order to stir up rebellion in the Visayas. He was anxious to secure all territories he could before the conditions for peace should be settled in Paris. At stake was the hope that actual possession of territories would influence the final decision.<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, p. 474.</ref>

By October 1898, fresh Tagalog expeditions were sent to Panay and coerced or persuaded its people to rise in greater force than ever, until finally, General de los Rios had to fall back to Iloilo. By the middle of November, after having secured the support of the inhabitants of the towns outside Iloilo through the leadership of General Martín Delgado, practically the whole island of Panay, except for Iloilo (the City Proper), Jaro, La Paz, and Molo, was under the revolutionary dominion. By December, de los Rios held only the city and port of Iloilo.<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

On December 25, 1898 (fifteen days after the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] on December 10),<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

Military Provincial Governor Ricardo Monet, who was representing Governor General de los Rios, together with Lt. Col. Agustín Solís, formally handed over Plaza Alfonso XII to Delgado, who represented Emilio Aguinaldo, president of the newly established Philippine Republic, in Iloilo. Delgado was named provincial governor afterwards.

The newly found freedom of the Ilonggos would be short-lived. The American forces arrived in Iloilo on December 27, 1898, under the command of General [[Marcus P. Miller]], and were afterwards reinforced up to a total strength of about 3,000 troops and two ships,<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

The [[Federal State of the Visayas]] was established on December 2, 1898, to promote the ideal of federation for an independent Philippine nation. It was composed of the Cantonal governments of Bohol and Negros, as well as the Provisional Government in the Visayas, which exercised powers over Panay and Romblon. The government of the federal state was patterned after the [[Federalism in the United States|United States federalism]] and the [[Swiss Confederacy|Swiss confederacy]].<ref name="greater2"/> The government was reportedly created following consultations with [[Emilio Aguinaldo]].

===Filipino–American War===

After the Spanish forces left the city, the revolutionary forces made a formal entry amidst music and banners. A government was constituted. On January 17, 1899, an election placed Raymundo Melliza, of a notable family from Molo that was respected by both the natives and foreigners, to office as Mayor. However, the influence of the new regime established by the government of Aguinaldo did not have effective extent far beyond a day's march from the Capital. At the threshold of the City and Province of Iloilo, the Americans were waiting for a signal from Manila. Two more ships supplemented the U.S. forces, even though no clashes with the revolutionaries took place after the Spaniards abandoned the city. Miller expressed demands for the surrender of Iloilo but no gun was fired. The Americans were waiting for the right moment, for it was not until February 6, 1899, that the American Senate ratified the Treaty of Paris.<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, pp. 511-512.</ref>

On February 4, hostilities broke out between Aguinaldo's forces and the Americans in Luzon. Emissaries brought Aguinaldo's message to the Ilonggos to hold the City against the enemies. The demand for surrender was renewed by Miller, on February 7, upon receipt of orders from Manila, with the threat to bombard Iloilo by the 12th day of the month if no surrender would take place.<ref name="John, Foreman 1907, p. 513">John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

As the Americans were preparing to attack the city, the 1,650 native troops under General Martin Delgado became uncontrollable and insolent to their officers. They were promised a monthly remuneration of Php4 and food, but only received Php1. Threats of mutiny, sacking and burning of the city, forced the Generals to collect money from the towns of Panay in order to appease the Visayan contingents. The same thing happened to the Tagalog component of the troops. The danger of riots in the city and the attitude of native soldiers fomented fear among the inhabitants. Chinese merchants closed their stores leaving only a small hole for transacting business. Many prominent families, who were in constant fear for their safety, went over to Negros Island in small schooners that flew the Philippine flag, without having any trouble with the American ships on standby in the waters between the two islands.<ref name="John, Foreman 1907, p. 513"/>

On February 10, an Extraordinary Session at the City Hall discussed plans for the impending bombardment of the city. There was a proposal to burn Iloilo, but the Mayor protested to this barbarous plan. A majority in the meeting was in favor of burning, which was seen as an invitation to despoil, lay waste and slay. The instigators who had no property interests in Iloilo, but who were so jealous of those who have, found a ready response of the Tagalog mercenaries, who had no local attachment to the city.<ref name="John, Foreman 1907, p. 515">John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, p. 515.</ref>

The Americans fired the first shell on February 11, 1899. Foreign eyewitnesses observed that the bombardment damaged quite a few buildings. In the meantime, from early morning, the withdrawing native soldiers, followed by a riffraff mob, were observed to have rushed hither and thither, throwing firebrands on to petroleum-washed houses. The Chinese had to barricade themselves to no use since fire burned their bazaars. Europeans and the Spanish half-castes had to defend themselves with every means possible, including bribing the rioters with a few pesos. Two British warships in the roadstead sent boats ashore and landed a party of marines, who made a gallant effort to save foreign properties,<ref name="John, Foreman 1907, p. 515"/> as the United Kingdom had a strong business interest in Iloilo and a Consulate.

By 1 o'clock of the same day, the Americans made a landing and restored order. Sentinels were stationed to protect what still remained of the townspeople's goods. In due course, indemnity claims were forwarded to the American military authorities, but were all rejected.<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C. Scribner's Sons, p. 516.</ref>

Ten years later, an article published in the local paper ''Nuevo Heraldo'' summarized the downfall of the Queen City in these words:

"The fire left behind only the name Iloilo, as the main part of the city was reduced to ashes by the retreating Ilongo troops. That event was the cause of the ruin of such a beautiful city, second only to Manila, where, if there was not a surplus of money, neither the people's welfare was wanting, and life was prosperous and peaceful. If the brain who planted such an unqualified act had measured the consequences... maybe he would never have dared doing it..."<ref>''Nuevo Heraldo'', Iloilo, February 11, 1908.</ref>

By February 1899, the Americans had started mobilizing to assert their authority over the City and Province. They continued to meet resistance from the Ilonggos, which lasted up to 1901. In which case, Iloilo was also among the last cities to fall to Americans.<ref name=Lopez>{{cite book |title=Iloilo: A Rich and Noble Land |author=Lopez Group Foundation |year=2008 |publisher=Benpres Publishing |location=Pasig, Philippines |isbn=978-971-93904-0-4 |page=278 }}</ref> Many leaders surrendered to the new regime and were reintegrated to the Ilonggo society without conditions. Among them was General Martin Delgado, who accepted the position of Governor of the Province of Iloilo from 1901 to 1904, under the American flag.

Local government was established in some towns of Iloilo by April 11, 1901. Jose Maria Gay was appointed Alcalde, Matias Hibiernas was teniente alcalde of Iloilo;Jose Yusay was President of Molo; Pablo Borromeo was President of Arevalo; Ruperto Montinola was the lone representative of Jaro, but was not its president; Madurriao's president was Emigdio Mesa. Emilio Magbanua was appointed its police delegate. It was observed by Juan de León y Benedicto, judge of the Court of First Instance that there existed a rivalry between the pueblos of Iloilo, Jaro and Molo, which are adjacent to and are only half an hour travel by carriage from each other. Besides, Molo and Jaro are residential pueblos, and Iloilo was the business town for both. It was also recommended that Arevalo be joined to Molo, and La Paz to Jaro. The aggregate population of these territories was at 100,000 in 1901.<ref name="archive.org">''Annual report of the Philippine Commission / Bureau of Insular Affairs, War Department to the President of the United States'', Washington D.C.: 1901, Vol. I, p. 130.

As the aftermath of the revolution and the Filipino–American War, it was clear to all the most sober-minded and best-educated Ilonggos that Aguinaldo's government was a failure in Panay at least. Visayans of position, with property interests at stake, were convinced that absolute independence without any control or protection from some established political power was premature and doomed to disaster. The Visayan grudge against the Tagalog predominance was also a factor that contributed to the failure of Aguinaldo's government. But the aggravating factor was the dictatorial air and brutal conduct of the Tagalog troops, which destroyed the theory of fraternal unity.<ref>John, Foreman, ''The Philippine Islands: a political, geographical, ethnographical, social and commercial history of the Philippine Archipelago, embracing the whole period of Spanish rule, with an account of the succeeding American insular government'', New York: 1907, C.

In 1900, no Americans reverted the city's status into a township. By virtue of Act No. 719 of 1903, the municipalities of [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]], [[La Paz, Iloilo City|La Paz]], [[Mandurriao]], and [[Molo, Iloilo City|Molo]], were incorporated into the municipality of [[Iloilo City Proper|Iloilo]].<ref>{{Citation |title=Act No. 719 – Act reducing the fifty-one municipalities of the Province of Iloilo to seventeen |url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/28/34121 |publisher=Supreme Court E-Library |access-date=December 31, 2019 |archive-date=December 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231080459/http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/28/34121 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Pavia, Iloilo|Pavia]] was also incorporated into Iloilo from [[Santa Barbara, Iloilo|Santa Barbara]] by virtue of Act No. 1333 19 April 1905.<ref>{{Citation |title=Act No. 1333 – An Act Amending Act Numbered Seven hundred and nineteen, entitled "An Act reducing the fifty-one municipalities of the Province of Iloilo to seventeen |url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/28/16999 |publisher=Supreme Court E-Library |access-date=December 31, 2019 |archive-date=December 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231095111/http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/28/16999 |url-status=live }}</ref> Later, Executive Order No. 64 24 December 1907 separated Pavia and Jaro from Iloilo and constituted them as the municipality of Jaro with effect on February 15, 1908.<ref>Executive Order No. 64 24 December 1907, see {{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/atf7298.0005.001.umich.edu |title=Executive Orders and Proclamations Issued by the Governor-General During the Year 1907 |date=1908 |publisher=Bureau of Printing |location=Manila |pages=125–126}}</ref> La Paz was re-established as a separate municipality in 1920 by virtue of Executive Order No. 70 signed on October 11, 1919.

The Americans initiated the construction of the Baluarte and Arroyo streets, the extension of Delgado Street to Valeria and from Fuentes and Jalandoni streets up to the present-day U.P. in the Visayas. Quezon and Mabini streets were asphalted while their sidewalks were also constructed. More significant was the installation of streetlights all throughout the city in 1921. In 1926, the widening of important streets, like General Luna, J.M. Basa and Ledesma, was started. In 1927, an improved street, Valeria-Ledesma (formerly known as Weyler), was inaugurated (David 1937).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstoday.info/2007/10/05/roads.and.bridges.in.iloilo.during.the.american.rule.html|title=Roads and bridges in Iloilo during the American rule|access-date=October 29, 2016|archive-date=May 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190523012347/http://www.thenewstoday.info/2007/10/05/roads.and.bridges.in.iloilo.during.the.american.rule.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

During the American colonial regime that time in the Philippine islands, the Americans brought with them their Protestant faith. A comity agreement was made in 1898 that the Philippine islands would be divided into different [[Protestant]] denominations for missionary works to avoid future conflicts; Iloilo is one of the first favored places in the country where the early Protestant sects came because of the city's economic prominence and importance next to Manila during such time.<ref>Guillermo & Verora, pp. 1–3</ref> [[Western Visayas]] and Negros, in accordance with the comity agreement, was given to the religious jurisdictions of the Baptists, although other Protestant sects were allowed to do missions in the same area.

[[File:Landing Fields - Philippines - Iloilo - NARA - 68160330.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Iloilo, circa early 1900s.]]

The Protestant missionaries initiated large-scale enterprises in the predominantly Catholic province. The [[Presbyterian]]s established the first Protestant and American hospital in the country, the [[Iloilo Mission Hospital]]. Supposedly it came also that Iloilo is the original location for foundation of [[Silliman University]], the first Protestant and American university in the country and in Asia. However, due to the Catholic opposition where the school will stand, the founder, [[David Sutherland Hibbard|David Hibbard]], prospected some new locations. He went to Cebu and later had a side trip in [[Dumaguete]], where he had a decision to establish and where Silliman University is presently located.<ref>{{Citation |last=Carson |first=Arthur, L. |title=Silliman University, 1901-1959 |publisher=United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia. |year=1965 |page=4}}</ref>

Baptists on the other hand, established institutions like Central Philippine University in 1905, as the first Baptist-founded and second American university in Asia; the [[Jaro Evangelical Church]], the first Baptist church in the Philippines; and the [[Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches]], the oldest Baptist organizational body in the Philippines.<ref name="wiki">[[Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches#cite ref-0|The Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches, Inc. – is the oldest Baptist organizational body in the Philippines.]] Retrieved October 19, 2012</ref> Later, the [[Seventh-day Adventist]]s established the Jaro Adventist Center, the first organized Seventh-day Adventist church outside Manila.

Under the auspices of the [[Presbyterian Church USA|Presbyterian Church]] in the United States in 1901, the Sabine Haines Memorial Union Mission Hospital (Union Mission Hospital) was established by [[American people|American]] missionary doctor Joseph Andrew Hall and his wife Jane Russell Hall. The hospital is also the first hospital for soldiers and the constabulary (predecessor of the [[Philippine National Police]]) during the American colonial regime in the country. The hospital pioneered the nursing education in the country through the establishment of the Union Mission Hospital Training School for Nurses, the first nursing school in the Philippines. Later, the hospital was handed over to the Protestant Baptists. In 1931, the Union Mission Hospital moved to its present site in a property bought by the Baptists, thus a year later in 1932, the hospital changed its name to Iloilo Mission Hospital along with its nursing school. The school was later transferred and became and organic academic unit of the Central Philippine University (the present-day [[Central Philippine University - College of Nursing|Central Philippine University College of Nursing]]. Iloilo Mission Hospital has over the years associated with Central Philippine University as its university hospital (CPU-Iloilo Mission Hospital).

Up to the present, the various evangelical Protestant denominations (composing around 2.8% of the Filipinos) and their educational institutions also serve Catholic students in Iloilo, who make up 83% of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.indexmundi.com/philippines/demographics_profile.html|title=Philippines Demographics Profile 2018|website=www.indexmundi.com|access-date=October 15, 2019|archive-date=April 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190408003950/https://www.indexmundi.com/philippines/demographics_profile.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Seizure of friar lands and parishes and the above-mentioned Protestant activities gave the American and Filipino public an impression of an anti-Catholic stance of the U.S. occupation of the Islands during the first years of the American rule. The [[Taft Commission]],  the sole legislative body of the American government for the Philippines (then known as the Philippine Islands under the sovereign control of the United States) while still under the [[Philippine–American War]], were attacked by Catholic press in New York for anti-Catholic bigotry. Soon, pressures from influential Catholics in the United States, and also in Ireland caused President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to appoint a Catholic in the commission to defend Catholic interest in the Philippines. Influential Catholics in Manila followed suit. Worries about Catholic vote in national elections moved the civil government to send the commission to the Vatican to negotiate exploring workable to solutions to the Catholic question in the newly acquired territory. Before coming to Rome, the head of the Commission personally visited the Cardinal Archbishop of Baltimore.<ref>Frank T.

It waS built to counter [[Protestantism]] by Spanish [[Roman Catholic]] Augustinian friars through their American confreres.]]

In Iloilo, American Catholics countered the Protestant American missions and the American Catholic bishops, like Frederick Rooker, [[Dennis Joseph Dougherty]], and James McCloskey, were named for the Roman Catholic See of Jaro in Iloilo City. These bishops sustained the educational achievements of the Spanish friars by bringing in American and European Catholic missionaries, among whom were the [[Sisters of Charity of St. Paul]], and [[Augustinians|Augustinian missionary priests]]. The Augustinians, who were the first to bring the Christian faith in the Philippines as well as in Panay island, and who built the centuries-old heritage churches in this island,<ref>Cf. Fr. Juan Fernandez, O.S.A, Monografias de los pueblos de la isla de Panay in Monographs of the Towns of Panay, Jose Espinosa, Jr., trans., Iloilo City: University of San Augustine, 2006</ref> established the Collegio de San Agustín in 1904, which eventually became the only university of the Augustinian Order in Asia. During the American regime, their confreres from the United States developed evermore this institution, which later became the first university in Iloilo. The American Catholic Bishops also maintained and upgraded the St. Vincent Ferrer Seminary (established in 1869 as the Collegio-Seminario de San Vicente Ferrer), which was the first institution of higher learning in Western Visayas. Despite the Augustinians being Catholics and Baptists being Protestants, they mutually enriched each other through dialogue mainly because Augustinian ideals were the foundations of Protestantism since the first Protestant was [[Martin Luther]] and he was a former Augustinian priest himself and the Protestant zeal for reformation from corruption even started some reform in the church itself. [[Saint Ezekiel Moreno]] who was ordained in the Minor Orders in Jaro, Iloilo had walked the fine line between reform, obedience and leadership since he ministered and walked hand in hand with condemned rebels and criminals in the [[Iwahig Prison and Penal Farm]], he was also obedient to his superiors in the [[Order of Augustinian Recollects]], a reform or "Recollection" movement in the Augustinian Order, which took elements from the Protestant Reformation. Saint Ezekiel Moreno also became the leader of a political movement when he became a Bishop of [[Pasto, Colombia]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/octubre1993/octubre2.htm |title=Biblioteca Luis Ángel Arango |access-date=April 24, 2019 |archive-date=December 1, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201193356/http://www.lablaa.org/blaavirtual/revistas/credencial/octubre1993/octubre2.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The visitation of Saint Ezekiel Moreno is a harmonized incarnation of the ancient [[Convivència]] in Spain when different religions and kingdoms; Pagan, Christian, Jewish and Muslim lived side by side and struggled to maintain their perspective purity, contested with each other and yet also mutually enriched each other without turning into a mongrelized melting pot of a mixed up and confused morass. Coincidentally, Saint Ezekiel Moreno was ordained in the Minor Orders in the then church of Jaro which housed a Virgin Mary statue under the Title of "[[Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Jaro]]". An image with complex Convivència alluding properties due to the confluence of many symbols from various cultures simultaneously present in the image but it is likely not earthly of nature and is a pure grace direct from heaven or an image "Not carved by human hands" due to its miraculous nature which was found floating in a river, shifting in weight and growing in size.

[[File:The National geographic magazine (Page 494) BHL40563491.jpg|thumb|left|A market in Iloilo, in the 1910s.]]

The Paulinian Sisters took charge of St. Paul Hospital, originally owned by the Catholic Diocese of Jaro. Bishop Dennis Joseph Dougherty, who later became [[Cardinal (Catholic Church)|Cardinal]] [[Archbishop]] of [[Philadelphia]], gave the medical facilities to the Sisters. To commemorate the bishop's generosity, the hospital named a more recent section of the facilities after him: the CADMA (Cardinal Dougherty Medical Annex). To meet the growing need to provide nurses for their hospital, the Paulinians also opened a nursing school. Today, this institution has also become a university ([[St. Paul University Iloilo]]), and has ever since supplied high-quality healthcare professionals known worldwide for their skills and dedication to work.

During the American colonial occupation, one of the platforms by the colonial government was first to establish and implement a public education system in the islands and the [[Thomasites]] were deployed and commissioned by the American government to teach in the public schools that will be established. The Thomasites tolerated religious freedom, which is one of the foundations of the United States constitution and legacy to the Philippines, while commissioned and under their tutelage to teach in public schools during the colonial period. Public schools that were established when the Thomasites came to Iloilo are Iloilo Normal School, the present-day [[West Visayas State University]] (formally established in 1924 but dates back its founding in 1902 as part of the [[Philippine Normal University|Philippine Normal School]] System in the Philippines); the Iloilo National High School, the first public provincial high school in the islands; and Baluarte Elementary School, the first public elementary school in the islands.

Commonwealth Act No. 57 was passed in 1936 granting city status to Iloilo; this charter was immediately amended by Commonwealth Act No. 158 some days later to incorporate the municipalities of La Paz and Arevalo as part of the new city's territory.<ref>{{Citation |title=Commonwealth Act No. 158 – An Act to amend Commonwealth Act Numbered Fifty-seven, entitled "An Act establishing a form of government for the City of Iloilo |publisher=Supreme Court E-Library |url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/29/16363 |access-date=December 31, 2019 |archive-date=December 31, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191231112457/http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/29/16363 |url-status=live }}</ref> Iloilo regained cityhood status on July 16, 1937, through Commonwealth Act 158.

By 1942, the Japanese invaded Panay and the economy moved into a standstill. During World War II, Iloilo was controlled by several Japanese battalions. Japan's ultimate goal was to entrench itself deeply into the Philippines so that at the close of the war they could occupy it just as the Spanish and the Americans had years before. The Japanese built "comfort stations" in Iloilo in 1942, where they imprisoned Filipino "[[comfort women]]" who they routinely gang-raped, brutalized, and murdered for entertainment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2020/11/29/939811000/philippine-survivor-recounts-her-struggle-as-a-comfort-woman-for-wartime-japan|title=Philippine Survivor Recounts Her Struggle As A 'Comfort Woman' For Wartime Japan|newspaper=NPR.org|publisher=NPR|access-date=15 August 2021|archive-date=November 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211116023658/https://www.npr.org/2020/11/29/939811000/philippine-survivor-recounts-her-struggle-as-a-comfort-woman-for-wartime-japan|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9IsBB-RVTlQC&dq=comfort+gay+philippines+japan&pg=PR9|title=The Other Empire: Literary Views of Japan from the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia|year=2008|publisher=The University of the Philippines Press|isbn=9789715425629|access-date=15 August 2021|archive-date=April 25, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240425112742/https://books.google.com/books?id=9IsBB-RVTlQC&dq=comfort+gay+philippines+japan&pg=PR9#v=onepage&q=comfort%20gay%20philippines%20japan&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.awf.or.jp/e1/philippine-00.html | title=Women made to be Comfort Women - Philippines | access-date=April 14, 2023 | archive-date=February 18, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230218032805/https://www.awf.or.jp/e1/philippine-00.html | url-status=live }}</ref> Nevertheless,  during the Japanese occupation, [[Macario Peralta Jr.]], freed most of Panay (With little exceptions) from Japanese Imperialism, thus other allied guerillas in other provinces from [[Romblon]], [[Palawan]], [[Marinduque]] and portions of [[Masbate]] and [[Mindoro]], considered majority liberated [[Panay Island]], the "[[Primus inter pares]]" in their alliance network.<ref name=Lapham>Lapham, R., and Norling, B., 1996, Lapham's Raiders, Lexington: The University Press of Kentucky,{{ISBN|0813119499}}</ref>{{rp|110}}

=== Post-war decline ===

The war heavily damaged the infrastructure in Iloilo. However, the continuing conflict between the labor unions in the port area, declining sugar economy, and the deteriorating peace and order situation in the countryside, the exodus of Ilonggos to other cities, provinces/regions and islands that offered better opportunities and business. People were moving to other cities such as Bacolod, Cebu, and Manila that led to Iloilo's decline in economic importance in central Philippines. Rural agricultural areas continued to help the local economy. For years, because of this exodus of investors, Iloilo's economy progressed in a moderate pace.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McCoy |first1=Alfred |year=1982|title=A Queen Dies Slowly |journal=Philippine Social History |publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press |pages=289–358}}</ref>

Change slowly came. First came the construction of the fishing port and a new international seaport. One by one, commercial business firms invested in Iloilo, spurring on the city to its eventual recovery.

Iloilo became a highly urbanized city on December 22, 1979, by the virtue of Batas Pambansa Blg. 51. Corollary to this new status, its residents effectively lost their eligibility to vote for provincial officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg51.html#.WLR7h_LK08g |title=Batas Pambansa Blg. 51 – An Act Providing For The Elective Or Appointive Positions In Various Local Governments And For Other Purposes |date=December 22, 1979 |publisher=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |access-date=February 27, 2016 |archive-date=March 14, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314185545/http://www.chanrobles.com/bataspambansa/bataspambansablg51.html#.WLR7h_LK08g |url-status=live }}</ref>

The closing weeks of 1969 marked the beginning of a period of unrest in the Philippines.

Among the student leaders in this organization were Vic Beloria, Renato Ganchero, and the brothers Napoleon and Rolando Lorca - all of whom would later be forced to go into hiding upon Marcos' declaration of martial law, lose their lives resisting the dictatorship, and be honored as martyrs of the fight against the Marcos regime by having their names inscribed on the wall at the Philippines' [[Bantayog ng mga Bayani]] (Heroes' memorial).<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bantayogngmgabayani.org/bayani/vic-beloria/ | title=Vic Beloria - Bantayog ng mga Bayani | date=May 26, 2023 | access-date=December 23, 2023 | archive-date=December 23, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231223170927/https://bantayogngmgabayani.org/bayani/vic-beloria/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://bantayogngmgabayani.org/bayani/napoleon-lorca/ | title=Napoleon Lorca - Bantayog ng mga Bayani | date=June 13, 2023 | access-date=December 23, 2023 | archive-date=December 23, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231223170928/https://bantayogngmgabayani.org/bayani/napoleon-lorca/ | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://bantayogngmgabayani.org/bayani/renato-ganchero/ | title=Renato Ganchero- Bantayog ng mga Bayani | date=May 31, 2023 | access-date=December 23, 2023 | archive-date=December 23, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231223170927/https://bantayogngmgabayani.org/bayani/renato-ganchero/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

=== 21st century and economic boom ===
After the opening of the new commercial and business center in Mandurriao district and with the construction of a national highway that traverses this area, big businesses like the [[SM Supermalls]], [[SM Prime Holdings]], [[Megaworld Corporation]], [[Gaisano Capital]], [[Robinsons Land]], [[Ayala Corporation]], [[Filinvest]], and [[Cebu Landmasters]] poured in huge investments in the city, giving impetus and catalyst toward future progress.

Furthermore, the rapid urbanization has extended beyond the city limits, resulting in extensive development and investments that have benefited the surrounding towns within Metro Iloilo. Distinguished developers, including [[Vista Land]], [[Sta. Lucia Land]], Global-Estate Resorts, Robinsons Land, Ayala Corporation, and International Builders Corporation, have actively contributed to shaping the evolving skyline of Metro Iloilo, outside the boundaries of Iloilo City.

== Geography ==
[[File:Iloilo City from air (Iloilo; 01-21-2023).jpg|alt=|thumb|Aerial view of Iloilo City.]]
Iloilo City is located in the southern shores of Panay Island. The city faces Iloilo Strait and Guimaras Island across it, making it a natural harbor and a safe anchorage for ships. It is bordered by the towns of Oton in the west, Pavia in the north and [[Leganes, Iloilo|Leganes]] in the northeast. Just across the [[Iloilo Strait]] in its eastern and southern coastlines, are the towns of [[Buenavista, Guimaras|Buenavista]] and [[Jordan, Guimaras|Jordan]] in the island-province of [[Guimaras]]
.

The city lies on a flat alluvial plain, reclaimed mostly from the swampy areas due to urbanization and industrialization in the late 19th century until the present. Traversing the city are the rivers of Iloilo, [[Batiano River|Batiano]], Jaro and Dungon Creek. [[Iloilo River]] is an [[estuary]] that separates the districts of City Proper, Molo and Villa Arevalo from the rest of the city. On the other hand, Jaro River is fed by its tributary rivers, Aganan and Tigum. Lately, a new escape channel for floodwaters coming from these two rivers to Iloilo Straight was developed, the Jaro Floodway. Iloilo City is {{convert|337.6|nmi|km|-1}} from Manila, {{convert|116|km}} from [[Roxas City]], {{convert|158|km}} from [[Kalibo]], and {{convert|97|km}} from [[San Jose de Buenavista]]. The city has a total land area of {{convert|70.3|km²|1|abbr=out}}.<ref name =profile>{{Citation | title = Socio-Economic Profile 2004 of Iloilo City | publisher = The City Government of Iloilo | year = 2004 }}</ref>

The city is divided into seven geographical districts.  All of the districts were once individual towns, excluding Lapuz, which was a sub-district of La Paz until 2008.{{refn|In 1903, the municipalities of Jaro, La Paz, Mandurriao, and Molo, were incorporated into the municipality of Iloilo. Pavia was also incorporated into Iloilo from Santa Barbara in 1905. In 1908, Pavia and Jaro were separated from Iloilo and constituted as the municipality of Jaro. La Paz was re-established as a separate municipality in 1920. In 1937, the town of Iloilo was amalgamated with the towns of La Paz and Arévalo as one [[chartered city]]. The municipality of [[Jaro, Iloilo City|Jaro]], on the other hand, was re-incorporated into Iloilo City in 1941.}} All districts have their own town centers complete with a plaza, a Roman Catholic church, a fire station, a police station and a public market. City Proper is a commercial area and the political center of the city and the Province of Iloilo and the Regional Government Center of Western Visayas.

Iloilo City is the center of the only officially recognized [[List of metropolitan areas in the Philippines|metropolitan area]] in Western Visayas.{{efn|Presidential Executive Order No. 559 of President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo signed on August 28, 2006}} The [[Metro Iloilo–Guimaras|metropolitan area]] is composed of the City of Iloilo, the municipalities of Leganes, Pavia, [[Santa Barbara, Iloilo|Santa Barbara]], [[Cabatuan, Iloilo|Cabatuan]], [[San Miguel, Iloilo|San Miguel]], Oton, the Island Province of Guimaras and its five municipalities, namely – [[Sibunag]], [[San Lorenzo, Guimaras|San Lorenzo]], [[Nueva Valencia]], Buenavista and Jordan.<!-- Please do not revert to turn back the former article with auto collapse list of Barangays in Iloilo City because it consumes a lot of space designated for a said part of article.

=== Language ===
{{main|Hiligaynon language}}
[[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] is the dominant language of Iloilo City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vicilongo.weebly.com/language.html|title=Language|website=Research Center for Iloilo|access-date=September 7, 2019|archive-date=August 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807152925/http://vicilongo.weebly.com/language.html|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Philippine English|English]] is used as the language of business and education. In addition, other local languages, such as [[Karay-a language|Karay-a]] (also known as Kinaray-a or obsolete Haraya), are also spoken by the minority coming from some parts of the province. [[Spanish language in the Philippines|Spanish]], once widely spoken during the colonial era up to the 1980s, is dying out, though a broken Spanish creole is spoken by a few of some Spanish-blood families and elderly sugar barons.

Hiligaynon is spoken in Panay, Guimaras and Negros islands, and is part of the [[Visayan language family]] of the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]]. It became the main language of [[Soccsksargen]] in [[Mindanao]], where majority of the residents are of Hiligaynon descent. Because Iloilo was a former Spanish colony for 300 years, Hiligaynon is heavily influenced by the Spanish language with a plethora of loaned words (''Guerra, Puerta, Golpe, Aguanta, Puerto, Calle'', and ''Edificio'', among others). Hiligaynon is mainly concentrated in the provinces of Iloilo, Guimaras and Negros Occidental. The language is referred to as "Ilonggo" ({{langx|es|Ilongo/Ylongo}}) in Iloilo and Negros Occidental. More precisely, "Ilonggo" is the ethno-linguistic group referring to the inhabitants of Iloilo and the culture associated with native Hiligaynon speakers. The distinction between the terms, Ilonggo and Hiligaynon, is unclear however, as many townspeople state that Hiligaynon is the language being spoken and Ilonggo is a term used to refer a person living in Iloilo or its associated culture and ethnicity.

=== Population ===

Based on the 2010 Census of Population and Housing (CPH), Iloilo City, a highly urbanized city in the province of Iloilo, posted a total population of 424,619 persons as of May 1, 2010. This is larger by 58,228 persons compared to its total population of 366,391 persons counted in the 2000 CPH. The increase in the population count from 2000 to 2010 translated to an average annual population growth rate (PGR) of 1.49 percent. This is lower than the 1.70 percent annual PGR of the city between the census years 1990 and 2000.
 
If the average annual PGR recorded at 1.49 percent during the period 2000 to 2010 continues, the population of Iloilo City would double in 47 years.

Forty years ago, the population of Iloilo City was only 209,738 persons. This population size is one-half of the population of the city in the 2010 CPH.

Among the 180 barangays comprising Iloilo City, barangay Calumpang was the most populous. Its population size was 2.6 percent of the total population of the city. San Juan came in second in terms of population size, with 2.3 percent share. This was followed by Balabago and Tabuc Suba (Jaro) with 2.0 percent each, Calaparan and So-oc with 1.9 percent each, Molo Boulevard with 1.8 percent, Santo Niño Sur with 1.7 percent, Cubay and Obrero-Lapuz with 1.6 percent each, and Bolilao with 1.5 percent. The rest of the barangays contributed less than 1.5 percent each.
 
The least populated barangay was Roxas Village with less than 0.1 percent share to the total population of the city. It was also the least populated barangay in 2000.

=== Religion ===
[[File:Jaro Cathedral (Catedral de Jaro).jpg|left|thumb|[[Jaro Cathedral]] or ''National Shrine of Our Lady of Candles'' of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Jaro]] is seat of the ''Roman Catholicism in Western Visayas'' and Candelaria devotion in the Philippines.]]

As the second National Shrine in the Visayas and Mindanao (first in Western Visayas and second Marian dedicated church to do so in Visayas and Mindanao), Jaro Metropolitan Cathedral is widely known as the seat of Candelaria devotion in the Philippines and Roman Catholicism in Western Visayas.

[[File:Bishop Jose Romeo O. Lazo (2).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jose Romeo O. Lazo]], the incumbent Roman Catholic Archbishop of Jaro.]]

Iloilo City is one of the notable centers of faith in the Philippines. Due to the heavy religions missions during the 300 years of Spanish colonialization, the city's population is predominant Catholic with over 90% belonging to the Roman Catholic Church. Other religious minorities such as Protestants (5%), {{lang|tl|Iglesia ni Cristo|italic=no}} (2%) and [[Aglipayans]] (1%) (also a form of Episcopal [[Anglo-Catholicism]]) have a significant presence at the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/attachments/hsd/specialrelease/Iloilo%20City_Statistical%20Tables.xls |title=Statistics |website=psa.gov.ph |access-date=October 15, 2019 |archive-date=October 25, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191025055817/https://psa.gov.ph/sites/default/files/attachments/hsd/specialrelease/Iloilo%20City_Statistical%20Tables.xls |url-status=live }}</ref>

The former city of Jaro (one of the present districts (boroughs) of Iloilo City) is the seat of bishopric and pioneer Christian institutions not only in Western Visayas but in the whole Philippines established through the Spanish colonization. The Spaniards which brought the Catholic faith established the [[Roman Catholic]] metropolitan see of the [[Archdiocese of Jaro]] with its diocesan cathedral while the Americans which brought the Protestantism established the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches (the first and oldest Baptist churches organization in the Philippines), the Jaro Evangelical Church (the first Baptist church in the Philippine islands), and Jaro Adventist Center (first organized Adventist church in the Philippines).

The Roman Catholic Archdiocese is one of the oldest and largest bishopric sees in the country. It was established as a parish in 1587 initially covering Catmon, Cabatuan and Maasin. It was created a diocese by virtue of a papal bull of Pope Pius IX on May 27, 1865. It has jurisdiction over sufragan bishops of Mindoro, Palawan, Zamboanga, the province of Iloilo, [[Negros Oriental]], Guimaras, San Jose de Buenavista, [[Capiz]], [[Bacolod]], San Carlos and [[Kabankalan]] in Negros Occidental.

Crowned personally during the apostolic visit of pope and saint [[John Paul II]] in 1981, it is the first marian image to receive such recognition without a papal legate in the Philippines and Asia.]]
It lost some of its territory to establish the Diocese of Zamboanga and Apostolic Prefecture of Palawan. Much later, three other ecclesiastical jurisdictions were established from parts of its territory: Diocese of Bacolod (July 15, 1932), Apostolic Prefecture of Mindoro (July 2, 1936), and Diocese of Capiz (January 27, 1951). The diocese was elevated into a Metropolitan Archdiocese by Pope Pius XII. Later, on March 24, 1962, it lost further some of its territory that resulted to the establishment the Territorial Prelature of San Jose de Antique (but still a part of it at present).

The Jaro Cathedral (National Shrine of the Our Lady of Candles) is the seat of the Archdiocese of Jaro. Saint Elizabeth of Hungary and the Our Lady of Candles is the official Catholic patronesses of the Archdiocese. The [[Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria de Jaro|Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria]] or Our Lady of the Candles is the official patron of the whole Western Visayas and Romblon.

Being designated as a National Shrine, Jaro Cathedral is likewise widely known as the seat of Roman Catholicism in Western Visayas. The said designation (National Shrine) by the [[Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines]] is the first of its kind in the region, the second in the Visayas (after Cebu), and the first Marian-dedicated church outside of Luzon.

[[File:Jaro Evangelical Church.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Jaro Evangelical Church]], the First Baptist Church in the Philippines (first Protestant church outside Manila).]]

Protestantism formed as the second-largest faith in the City of Iloilo. Protestant sects were brought by the Americans when the Philippines was ceded to American rule by Spain through the 1898 Treaty of Paris.

The said faith brought by the United States in the heavily Roman Catholic Iloilo has gained adherents and still continues to grow at present. Iloilo which is one of the pioneering places in the country where Protestants set foot strongly contributed due to its economic importance on the international scene in the early 1900s. The American colonial government tolerated religious freedom that even to this day Iloilo is still predominantly Catholic.

Presbyterians and Baptists are among the first Protestant sects that arrived in Iloilo. The arrival of the American Protestant denominations resulted in the establishment of notable pioneering institutions in Iloilo. The Presbyterians established the [[Iloilo Mission Hospital]] in 1901 (the first American and Protestant hospital in the Philippines) while Baptists established the American [[John D. Rockefeller]]-funded [[Central Philippine University]] in 1905 (the first Baptist and second American university in the Philippines and in Asia), [[Jaro Evangelical Church]] in 1900 (the first Baptist church in the Philippines and also the first Protestant church outside Manila (2nd in the Philippines after the Central United Methodist Church in Manila), and the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches (the first and oldest Baptist churches organized in the Philippines).

The Seventh-day Adventists did not join the comity agreement with the early Protestant sects for jurisdictional division on the Philippine islands for missionary works, because they wanted to go to any parts of the country. They arrived years later following the advent of Protestant missions in the Philippines in the early 1900s in Iloilo. Their arrival resulted in the founding of ''Jaro Adventist Center'', the first organized Seventh-day Adventist church outside Manila.

There are other Christian sects, such as {{lang|tl|[[Iglesia ni Cristo]]|italic=no}} and [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], and communities of non-Christian sects such as [[Islam]] brought by Muslim-Filipinos from the south, [[Sikhism]] by the Indian immigrants, and [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]] brought by [[Chinese people|Chinese]] immigrants.

Iloilo City has the second-largest economy in the Visayas, after Cebu City, with a [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of ₱145.05 billion in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2022 Economic Performance of Highly Urbanized Cities Outside the National Capital Region {{!}} Philippine Statistics Authority {{!}} Republic of the Philippines |url=https://psa.gov.ph/content/2022-economic-performance-highly-urbanized-cities-outside-national-capital-region |access-date=2024-07-11 |website=psa.gov.ph}}</ref> It is the hub for trade, commerce, finance, technology, medical tourism, hospitality, real estate, tourism, education, and industry in the Western Visayas region. Major industries in the city include management of port facilities, telecommunications infrastructure and utilities, banking and finance, retail trading, real estate, tourism and [[business process outsourcing]]. The local government has provided incentives to businesses in certain investment areas, such as income tax holidays and free issuance of permits and licenses.<ref name="profile2010">{{citation | author=City Government of Iloilo |title=Socio-Economic Profile 2010 |year = 2010 }}</ref> It is the home of [[Mang Inasal]], headquartered in Iloilo.

During the Spanish colonial period, sugar was the main export product of Iloilo. The said industry brought immense wealth to the city alongside when its port was opened to the international trade. As a result, known and old-rich families' wealth was propelled by sugarcane plantations. It yielded affluent clans that are known in the region and the country up to today, which originated in Iloilo—''Lacson'', ''Locsin'', ''Ledesma'', ''Montinola'', ''Lopez'', to name a few. After World War II, the sugar industry in Iloilo waned, and the importance of the city as the second most important economic center next to Manila diminished.

It was in the 21st century that its economic rebounded, led in particular by the opening of the [[Iloilo International Airport]] in 2007, which replaced the [[Mandurriao Airport|old Iloilo Airport]] in Mandurriao.  The Iloilo International Airport is the fifth busiest airport in the country. The acquisition of the old airport after it was decommissioned and the construction of a business park on its site by the real estate giant [[Megaworld Corporation]], became a catalyst for some land developers to invest in Iloilo.

As an economic hub in the Western Visayas region, the metropolis leads the Western Visayas region as the city with the most bank savings deposits and accounts (third in the Philippines); the [[Port of Iloilo]], which is one of the historical ports in the Philippine islands, is now one of the busiest ports and natural harbors in the country by terms of passenger movement and cargo handling.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vicilongo.weebly.com/|title=Research Center for Iloilo|website=Research Center for Iloilo|access-date=August 7, 2019|archive-date=August 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190807152922/http://vicilongo.weebly.com/|url-status=live}}</ref> Iloilo City has the lowest crime rate in the Philippines,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/travel-and-tourism/2017/05/27/1704179/walk-through-iloilo-business-park|title=A walk through Iloilo Business Park|website=philstar.com|access-date=August 9, 2019|archive-date=August 9, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190809125726/https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/travel-and-tourism/2017/05/27/1704179/walk-through-iloilo-business-park|url-status=live}}</ref> the lowest level of corruption, the highest life expectancy in Visayas and Mindanao, a large concentration of middle class, ranks first in the happiness index,<ref>{{cite news | url=https://ph.news.yahoo.com/ilonggos-enjoyment-life-rates-high-nscb-hdi-ranking-095219255.html | title=Ilonggos' Enjoyment Of Life Rates High In NSCB's HDI Ranking | date=February 2, 2013 | work=Manila Bulletin | via=Yahoo | access-date=August 14, 2019 | archive-date=August 14, 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190814164647/https://ph.news.yahoo.com/ilonggos-enjoyment-life-rates-high-nscb-hdi-ranking-095219255.html | url-status=live }}</ref> and the most business-friendly city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bomboradyo.com/iloilo/iloilo-city-ginpasidunggan-nga-2019-most-business-friendly-lgu-award/|title=Iloilo City ginpasidunggan nga 2019 Most Business Friendly LGU &#124; Bombo Radyo Iloilo|date=October 9, 2019|access-date=October 17, 2019|archive-date=October 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017113046/https://www.bomboradyo.com/iloilo/iloilo-city-ginpasidunggan-nga-2019-most-business-friendly-lgu-award/|url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Banking and finance ===

The banking industry in Iloilo dates back during the Spanish times. The establishment of banks during that time was the result of the sugar-boom and Iloilo's importance as an international gateway when its port was open for foreign ships. The first [[Bank of the Philippine Islands|Banco Español-Filipino]] (now Bank of the Philippines), opened its first branch outside of Manila in Iloilo. The first [[Philippine National Bank]] branch outside Manila also opened in the city. With that, there are also international banks implying the city's importance in banking history in the Philippines, that opened in Iloilo during Spanish-American times that ceased their operations in the city: the [[Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation]] (HSBC), first HSBC branch outside Manila; and [[Standard Chartered]] (first Standard Chartered Bank branch outside Manila).

At present, Iloilo ranks 3rd in the country as the city with most deposits or savings account, fueled by [[Overseas foreign worker|OFW]] remittances, IT-BPO industry, and the local industries. The surge of microfinancial and other lending institutions in the city has also sprouted. It is the headquarters of [[LifeBank (Philippines)|LifeBank MFI]], the Iloilo's largest homegrown microfinancial institution (3rd largest microfinancial institution in the country) with ~500 branches across the Philippines.

[[Queen City Development Bank]] (QueenBank) which is owned by the Florete Group, is one of the founding member of [[Megalink]] (the first bank outside of Manila to become a member of it) has its headquarters and 1st branch in Iloilo City.

=== Tourism ===
[[File:ATI Warrior of Dinagysng Festial.jpg|left|thumb|[[Dinagyang]] Tribe Warriors during the Tribe Dance Competition.]]
As a gateway to the Western Visayan region, tourism plays a major part as a catalyst in contributing to Iloilo City's economy. The metropolis hosts notable festivals which entice thousands of tourists annually especially during the [[Dinagyang Festival|Dinagyang]], [[Kasadyahan]], [[Paraw Regatta]] (Asia's oldest sailing event), and [[Nuestra Señora de la Candelaria|Fiesta de Candelaria]] festivals seasons. Iloilo City's bannered monickers like ''"City of Love''" and ''"City of Mansions"'' and intensified local government's programs such as beautification of major thoroughfares in the city and building of parks, has played a role in attracting local and foreign visitors also. There are myriad of selections of attractions in the city that tourists can visit – heritage landmarks, museums, art galleries, parks, and restaurants, to name a few. Nightlife in the metro with Smallville Complex as the mecca for party-goers is flocked by revellers every night especially on Friday and weekends.

A well known Philippine heritage city built during the Spanish era, heritage tourism adds also to the city's charm which magnets visitors. Centuries old churches, old edifices and mansions of well known Ilonggo families, magnets sightseers from different places who wants to discover Iloilo City's rich and glorious past. Iloilo City is also respected gastronomic capital with famous dishes originated in the area that gained popularity throughout the country – [[Batchoy|La Paz Batchoy]], [[Pancit Molo]], [[Cansi|Kansi]], [[Laswa]], [[Kadyos, baboy, kag langka|KBL (Kadyos, Baboy kag Langka)]], [[Chicken inasal|Chicken Inasal]], Tinuom, and [[Kadyos, manok, kag ubad|KMU (Kadyos, manok, kag ubad)]].

In 2018 alone, Iloilo City attracted the highest tourist arrivals in [[Western Visayas]], posting 1,242,087 total arrivals, including 1,154,550 domestic visitors, 70,787 foreign guests, and 16,750 overseas workers. Following in 2019, it garnered an 11.59% increase in the previous year's data.<ref name="Iloilo province's 2019 tourist arrivals up 11.59%">[https://www.panaynews.net/iloilo-provinces-2019-tourist-arrivals-up-11-59/ Iloilo province's 2019 tourist arrivals up 11.59%] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220222173254/https://www.panaynews.net/iloilo-provinces-2019-tourist-arrivals-up-11-59/ |date=February 22, 2022 }}.

Iloilo City is the regional capital of Western Visayas region and the provincial capital of [[Iloilo province]]. It is one of the important economic centers in the Philippines and regional and provincial offices of national government agencies has offices in the city. It is classified as a first income class and [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] (HUC). Due to such status and classification, it is independent from the province of Iloilo, thus its citizens does not have the power to elect for political provincial officials.

[[File:Iloilo Seal.svg|thumb|170px|right|Former seal of Iloilo City, in use since 1950. The central seal, often mistaken as the "coat of arms" of the city, was granted when Iloilo achieved its status as a royal city on October 5, 1889, through a decree issued by the [[Regent|Queen Regent]] [[Maria Christina of Austria|Maria Cristina]], on behalf of her son King [[Alfonso XIII of Spain]], who was still a minor in that year.<ref name="auto3"/><ref name="auto1"/>]]

The city's actual existence dates back to its founding in 1566 through a settlement established by the Spaniards in the areas of Oton and Villa de Arevalo and received its cityhood status thrice – first on October 5, 1889 (effectivity in 1890) through a Spanish royal decree issued by the Queen Regent of Spain, Maria Christina, secondly in 1893 through a legal declaration by the virtue of ''Bacura/Becerra Law'' ratifying the first royal decree and establishing the city government of Iloilo, and the third through a virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 158 on July 16, 1937, formally inaugurated on August 25, 1937, as a chartered city, by consolidating the existing City of Iloilo with the towns of Arevalo, Mandurriao, Molo, and La Paz, while the City of Jaro was officially annexed on January 7, 1941, through the virtue of Commonwealth Act No. 604 of August 22, 1940, issued by [[Manuel L. Quezon|President Manuel L. Quezon]]. By such decrees, the City of Iloilo is the first legal city in the Philippines because no law ratifies and established by the government that creates and enacts an edict declaring or elevating a town into a status of a city during Spanish and early American colonial periods.

The city acquired its royal title ''"La Muy Leal y Noble Ciudad"'' (The Most Loyal and Noble City) on March 1, 1898, given by Queen Regent Maria Christina of Spain due to the loyalty stand by the Ilonggos to the Spanish crown during the Philippine war of independence. It is likewise one of the few ''Spanish Royal Cities in the Philippines'' during the Spanish colonial era in the Philippines.

The [[Mayor of Iloilo City]] ''(Alcalde)'' is the chief executive and is assisted by the vice mayor ''(vice-alcalde)'' which governs the city. The city is also represented by a congressman in the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines]]. The Iloilo City Council (Filipino: ''Sangguniang Panglungsod ng Iloilo'' and Spanish: ''Consejo de Ciudad de Iloilo'') is the local legislative assembly. Its 15-member council is elected concurrently with general elections, held at the same time with the national elections including for the city and vice mayors. The Council convenes every month at the [[Iloilo City Hall]] ''(Ayuntamiento de Iloílo)'', and the meetings are open to the public. The matters on which the councillors decide have generally already been drafted and discussed by various boards and committees.<ref name="THE ILOILO CITY COUNCIL">[https://iloilocitycouncil.org/the-iloilo-city-council/  THE ILOILO CITY COUNCIL] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190425031643/https://iloilocitycouncil.org/the-iloilo-city-council/ |date=April 25, 2019 }}.

The city's modern-day appearance is shaped by the key role it has played as a trading hub for centuries. Iloilo City has a multitude of districts, each with its distinctive character and representing colonial influence. Iloilo's other distinctive features include its cityscape surrounded with water features such as rivers and is bounded by a sea; bicycle paths and ornamental trees that line most city streets; and its many open spaces, gardens and parks.

Iloilo spreads out with its location in a plain land in south eastern side of Panay Island. It is bounded in the south east side by Iloilo-Guimaras Strait and Guimaras Island which makes the city as a natural harbor for ships. The two main rivers of Iloilo and Batiano snakes through the city and empties out of the Iloilo-Guimaras Strait.

Iloilo is a conglomerate of former separate towns which includes the former city of Jaro established during the Spanish colonial times, thus the layout of the towns civic centers follows a typical Spanish colonial town center composed of a Plaza (Public Square), church, municipal hall and other religious, academic and government instrumentalities offices. A modern development is clustered in an organized form in the city's premises but is strongly concentrated in the Mandurriao district to protect the city's initiatives in protecting the city's skyline, heritage zones and environment.

Iloilo City's urban planning and architecture reflect the plans of the Spanish and the American colonial administrations.

The [[Spanish culture|Spanish]] colonial influence is strongly imprinted not only in Iloilo's history and cultural background but also the architectural perspective.

The city's regaled status during the Spanish colonial era until the turn of the 20th century is implied during by the sugar boom with ubiquitous stately mansions and edifices built by the old money Ilonggo Sugar Baron and elite families which contrast to the city's economic importance as a second city next to Manila during the said era in the Philippines.  The city's other moniker – ''City of Mansions''  is likewise implied because Iloilo holds 240 mansions in which 30 of it are grand mansions built during the Spanish and American colonial eras.

[[File:Newly renovated Jaro Belfry.jpg|thumb|upright|Campanario de Jaro ([[Jaro Belfry]]), one of the few free-standing bell towers in the Philippines that is detached from the church.]]
The ravaged ''Fuerte de San Pedro'' ([[Fort San Pedro (Iloilo)|Fort San Pedro]]) is Iloilo's ground zero as there was no Iloilo City back in the 1600s. As a fortress, Fort San Pedro was built solely by the Spaniards to protect Iloilo from the marauding pirates and privateers. The fort is the second Spanish built fort after the one in Cebu (also Fort San Pedro) in the Philippines and Asia. The foundation of the Fort San Pedro was substantial to the Spanish Empire's stronghold as Panay Island with Iloilo as their second colonial center established through the Iloilo precursor towns of Oton (1566) and La Villa Rica de Arevalo (1581). Oton which was founded as early as 1566 but formally established in 1572 was the actual second seat of Spanish colonial powers but due to pirate attacks, they moved the capital eastward and established the ''La Villa Rica de Arevalo''.

The town of La Villa Rica de Arevalo holds some of the fine example of Spanish built mansions like the mansion of the Spanish Governor General, but were destroyed when the pirates ransacked and destroyed the town. It was in the said frequent events of pirate attacks that the Spaniards moved finally the capital further eastward in the mouth of ''Rio de Iloilo'' (Iloilo River) which is flanked and protected by [[Guimaras Island]] across it.

[[File:Casa De Emperador (Megaworld Boulevard, Mandurriao, Iloilo City; 10-22-2022).jpg|left|thumb|Casa de Emperador in [[Iloilo Business Park]], an example of modern built classical styled edifice.]]
It was in the said establishment of the city on the mouth of Iloilo River that as years go by, the city flourished to its heights especially in the economic and regal importance in the Spanish and American eras. La Villa Rica de Arevalo (Arevalo) is the first Spanish named town in the Philippine islands. It is also in Arevalo that the third oldest image of Holy Child Jesus (Señor Santo Niño) in the Philippines was brought by the Spaniards. Notable present-day structures that are repositories that attest to the town's former glory as a Spanish precursor town of Iloilo is the mansion of [[Camiña Balay Nga Bato|Camiña Balay nga Bato]] and the Convento de Arevalo.

During the Spanish and American eras, the city developed its own unique charm that exudes a typical European city in the east which differed it from other cities just like the old Manila in the Philippines. It was in the said eras that architectural perspective of Iloilo flourished with European styled edifices and stately mansions was built which stands of Iloilo's once economic and political importance in its heyday.

[[Calle Real, Iloilo|Calle Real]] (Royal Street) which stretches from [[Plazoleta Gay]] up to Plaza Alfonso XII ([[Plaza Libertad]]) is Iloilo's Escolta (a heritage street in Manila) lined with commercial edifices that possesses European designs. Calle Real is Iloilo's old Central Business District and is considered as the second-most preserved heritage business district in the Philippines. The street during the Iloilo's economic heyday during the late 19th and early 20th centuries when the ''Puerto de Iloilo'' (Port of Iloilo) was opened to the international trade is a melting pot and common ground for people of different walks of life, race and color. Stores back then in Calle Real sells luxury goods and items from all over the world.

Iloilo also possesses structures built during the prelude of the American colonial period in the Philippines. ''Aduana de Iloilo'' ([[Iloilo Customs House]]) and [[old Iloilo City Hall]] are notable of the structures built during the said colonial period. Iloilo Customs House, the second-largest customs house after the Aduana in Manila was built the Filipino Architect Juan M. Arellano.

In farther north is the town of Jaro, the largest of all the district of the City of Iloilo. Once a separate city before it merged with the City of Iloilo in the 1940s, is considered as a town of piousness, old rich and grandeur. Many notable Spanish Ilonggos settled and the said area and built their grand mansions and villas. The town's architecture is heavily influenced by the Hispanic and American cultures.

[[File:Molo Church (Molo, Iloilo City; 01-26-2023).jpg|left|thumb|[[Molo Church|Iglesia de Molo]] (St. Anne Parish), the first Gothic and feminist church outside Manila.]]
Grand mansions with imposing European styled facades and motifs of ''''Buena Familias'''' or ''"Old-rich families"'' (Spanish-Chinese-Filipino families) of Jaro like the Lopez, Ledesma, Lizares, Jalandoni, Javellana and Locsin families that some of it lines the first millionaire row in the Philippine islands still stands to this day. Two of notable mansions that attest to Jaro's importance as an old rich town that developed out of the sugar boom during the Spanish colonial period is the [[Mansion de Lopez]] (Lopez Mansion) or Nelly Garden and the beaux-art styled [[Villa Lizares]] (Lizares Mansion) which houses at present the [[Angelicum School Iloilo]] of the Dominicans.

Religion is also a crucial factor that influenced Jaro's architectural and town plan perspective as it is the cradle of Christian faith in Western Visayas. The Spanish which brought the Roman Catholic faith established the Jaro Cathedral (National Shrine of the Our Lady Candles) with its separate [[Jaro Belfry|belfry]] located across it (one of the few churches in the Philippines with a detached belfry) and the Seminario-Colegio de San Vicente Ferrer (the first institution of Higher Learning in Western Visayas). The advent of American colonialization which brought Protestantism has resulted also to the establishment of institutions.

[[File:Festive Walk Parade (Phase 2).jpg|thumb|''Torre del Reloj'' (The Clock Tower) of Festive Walk Parade at [[Iloilo Business Park]]. Its construction is a result of the economic boom of the City of Iloilo since 2010.]]

Fine examples of institutions with edifices possessing American architecture and influence includes the Central Philippine University by the Protestant Baptists in 1905 which holds century-old American colonial-styled edifices, the Convention of Philippine Baptist Churches which housed at the European styled former (Rupert) Montinola Mansion in Fajardo, Jaro, and the Jaro Evangelical Church (the first Baptist Church in the Philippine Islands), are among the few of the notable institutions that holds a number of structures that possesses American architectural influence design.

The town of Molo located westward of the "La Punta" (City Proper) is sometimes called "Parian" or Chinese town during the Spanish colonial times. Old rich Molo influential families helped shaped the town's not only economical but political and architectural sphere. The town just like the more Spanish or Mestizo town of Jaro has also a plethora of mansions built by old-rich Chinese-Spanish-Ilonggo Locsin, Lacson, Sayson, Layson and Pison families. The [[Molo Church]] "(Iglesia de Santa Ana)" which was built under the supervision of some of the members of notable Molo families like the "Locsins", is the first and only feminist church outside Manila with its imposing façade with gothic influence facing the "Plaza Molo". The "Yusay-Consing" Mansion or [[Molo Mansion]] located just across the Plaza Molo and Molo Church was bought by the retail and real estate giant SM Group has been refurbished and restored to its former glory and is now a houses several cultural stores and a mini-museum which exhibits several artworks and native products.

The present economic boom of the 21st century has spurred modern developments across the city. Huge investments of big real estate developers built modern malls and shopping centers, tall and modern edifices and skyscrapers which sprouted up especially in the new city's ''Central Business Center'' which occupies a huge land area in the town of [[Mandurriao, Iloilo City|Mandurriao]]. The first tallest skyscraper in Western Visayas, the [[Injap Tower Hotel|Injap Tower]] of the Double Dragon Properties could be found in the area. Hotels and condominiums and tree-lined avenues with jogging and bicycle lanes have also been built during the city's economic renaissance up to the present.
