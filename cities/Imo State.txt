'''Imo State''' ({{lang-ig|Ọha Imo}}) is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in the [[South East (Nigeria)|South-East geopolitical zone]] of [[Nigeria]], bordered to the north by [[Anambra State]], [[Rivers State]] to the west and south, and [[Abia State]] to the east.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Imo {{!}} state, Nigeria {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Imo |access-date=2022-03-12 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> It takes its name from the [[Imo River]] which flows along the state's eastern border. The state capital is [[Owerri]] and the State's slogan is the "Eastern Heartland."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nigeria's 36 States and Their Slogans |url=https://nigerianfinder.com/nigerias-36-states-and-their-slogans/ |access-date=2022-03-12 |website=nigerianfinder.com|date=10 August 2019 }}</ref>

Of the [[States of Nigeria|36 States]] in Nigeria, Imo is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|third smallest in area]] but is [[List of Nigerian states by population|fourteenth most populous]] with an estimated population of over 5.4 million as of 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nigeria Population 2022 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs) |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/nigeria-population |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=worldpopulationreview.com}}</ref> Geographically, the state is divided between the [[Niger Delta swamp forests]] in the far east and the drier [[Cross–Niger transition forests]] in the rest of the state. Other key geographical features are the state's rivers and lakes with the [[Awbana River|Awbana]], [[Imo River|Imo]], [[Orashi River|Orashi]], and [[Otamiri River|Otamiri]] rivers along with the [[Oguta Lake]] in western Imo State.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-07-22 |title=What are the two lakes in Imo State? |url=https://bigboardscouting.com/qa/what-are-the-two-lakes-in-imo-state.html |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=big board scouting |language=en-US |archive-date=3 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220903165853/https://bigboardscouting.com/qa/what-are-the-two-lakes-in-imo-state.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Modern-day Imo State has been inhabited for almost a thousand years by the [[Igbo people]] with the [[Igbo language]] serving as a [[lingua franca]] alongside [[English language|English]] throughout the state. In the pre-colonial period, what is now Imo State was a part of medieval [[Kingdom of Nri]] and the later [[Aro Confederacy]] before the latter was defeated in the early 1900s by British troop then the [[Anglo-Aro War]]. After the war, the British incorporated the area into the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] which later merged into [[British Nigeria]] in 1914; after the merger, Imo became a centre of anti-colonial resistance during the [[Women's War]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2009-03-27 |title=Aba Women's Riots (November-December 1929) • |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/aba-womens-riots-november-december-1929/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |language=en-US}}</ref>

After independence in 1960, the area of the present-day Imo was a part of the post-independence [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]] until 1967 when the region was split and the area became part of the [[East Central State]]. Less than two months afterwards, the former Eastern Region attempted to secede in the three-year long Nigerian Civil War with Imo as a part of the secessionist, Igbo nationalist state of [[Biafra]]. The area was hard fought over throughout the war with Owerri and its surrounding area exchanging hands twice before Owerri was named the Biafran capital in 1969. The present-day Imo State was captured by federal forces in early 1970 with [[Operation Tail-Wind]] taking the city and ending the war.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Imo State {{!}} Culture {{!}} Economy {{!}} People {{!}} Naijabiography |url=https://naijabiography.com/history-culture/history-of-imo-state/ |access-date=2022-09-03 |website=Naijabiography Media |language=en-US}}</ref> At the war's end and the reunification of Nigeria, the [[East Central State]] was reformed until 1976 when Imo State was formed by the [[Murtala Muhammed]] regime. Fifteen years afterwards, Imo State was divided with eastern Imo being broken off to form the new [[Abia State]].<ref>{{cite web |title=This is how the 36 states were created |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e |website=Pulse.ng |date=24 October 2017 |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Abia {{!}} state, Nigeria {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Abia |access-date=2022-03-12 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

The hottest months are between January and March.<ref name="aboutimo"/><ref name="wordtravels.com"/><ref name="gai5"/>

With high population density and over farming, the soil has been degraded and much of the native [[vegetation]] has disappeared.<ref name="aboutimo"/>

This [[deforestation]] has triggered [[soil erosion]], which is compounded by heavy seasonal rainfall that has led to the destruction of houses and roads.<ref name="aboutimo"/><ref>[http://www.africatalksclimate.com/galleries/imo-state-nigeria Africatalksclimate.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707092750/http://www.africatalksclimate.com/galleries/imo-state-nigeria |date=7 July 2011 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200912170314.html|title=Nigeria: Erosion - Ihioma Network Appeals to FG|first=Emeka|last=Ihiegbulem|date=17 December 2009|access-date=29 April 2018|via=AllAfrica|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121012233612/http://allafrica.com/stories/200912170314.html|archive-date=12 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

=== Environmental issues ===

==== Soil erosion ====

[[Erosion|Soil erosion]] is the most common geo-environmental hazard in Imo State, with over 360 erosion sites, out of which 57 are confirmed to be critical and in need of immediate remediation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite SSRN |first1=G.

These gullies are attributed mainly to poor [[civil engineering]] works, specifically road/gutter construction as well as [[sand mining]]. During [[road construction]], adequate control of the [[Surface runoff|runoff]] generated in this process is poorly taken into consideration. There is also no proper termination, [[Spillway|spill way]], and [[gabion]]s to lower intense flow to non-erosion velocities during [[Street gutter|gutter construction]]. Hence, [[rainwater]] overflow from concrete gutters resulting in erosion, especially at the intersection of gutter and road.<ref name=":1" />

Due to gullies, [[farmlands]] have been significantly affected, with both farmlands and their road paths lost. There is also loss of social [[infrastructure]]s such as, electricity and pipe-borne waters. Communities such as [[Ikeduru]], [[Orlu, Imo|Orlu]], [[Ehime Mbano]], [[Nwangele]], [[Nkwerre]] and [[Mbaitoli]] dependent on stream and harvested rainwater for domestic use have been impacted due to surface water/stream pollution caused by intense runoffs from the gully sites.<ref name=":1" />

[[Nigeria Erosion and Watershed Management Project]] (NEWMAP), kick-started in the state on November 11, 2014 and the ecological fund are some of the interventions for soil erosion in the State.<ref>{{Cite web |title=NEWMAP Commences Means To Tackle Erosion In Imo State |url=https://www.channelstv.com/2015/06/21/newmap-commences-means-to-tackle-erosion-in-imo-state/ |access-date=2022-03-09 |website=Channels Television}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-09-19 |title=Cut off!

== History ==
Imo State came into existence in 1976, along with other new states created under the leadership of the late military ruler of Nigeria, [[Murtala Muhammed]], having been previously part of [[East-Central State]]. The state is named after the [[Imo River]], which bears the name of a prominent [[Nigerians|Nigerian]] family with that family name, who were the chiefs of Imo State before the ratification of a more formal government.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.onlinenigeria.com/links/imoadv.asp?blurb=268 |title=Physical Setting: Imo State |access-date=13 August 2007 |work=OnlineNigeria.com |publisher=Devace Nigeria |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926233927/http://www.onlinenigeria.com/links/imoadv.asp?blurb=268 |archive-date=26 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Part of it was split off in 1991 as [[Abia State]], and another part became [[Ebonyi State]].<ref name=":2" />

If no candidate passes this threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of Local Government Areas.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oguntola |first=Tunde |date=2022-09-27 |title=2023: Next President, Govs Must Get Two-thirds Spread, Says INEC |url=https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |access-date=2023-02-24 |language=en-US}}</ref>
