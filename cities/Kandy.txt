'''Kandy''' ({{langx|si|මහනුවර}} ''Mahanuwara'', {{Audio|Si-Mahanuwara.ogg|pronounced}} {{IPA-si|mahanuʋərə|}}; {{langx|ta|கண்டி}} Kandy, {{Audio|Ta-கண்டி.ogg|pronounced}} {{IPA-ta|ˈkaɳɖi|}}) is a major city located in the [[Central Province, Sri Lanka|Central Province]] of [[Sri Lanka]]. It was the last capital of the [[Sinhalese monarchy]] from 1469 to 1818, under the [[Kingdom of Kandy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.gov.lk/arch_assets1.html|title=Major Cultural Assets/Archaeological Sites|access-date=2010-10-24|publisher=Department of Archaeology Sri Lanka|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100329223537/http://www.archaeology.gov.lk/arch_assets1.html|archive-date=29 March 2010}}</ref> The city is situated in the midst of hills in the Kandy plateau, which crosses an area of tropical plantations, mainly tea. Kandy is both an administrative and religious city and the capital of the Central Province. Kandy is the home of the [[Temple of the Tooth]] Relic (''[[Sri Dalada Maligawa]]''), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1988.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/450|title=Sacred City of Kandy|publisher=UNESCO |access-date=2017-05-01}}</ref>  Historically the local  [[Buddhist]] rulers resisted [[Portugal|Portuguese]], [[Netherlands|Dutch]], and [[United Kingdom|British]] colonial expansion and occupation.

== Etymology ==
The city and the region have been known by many different names and versions of those names. Some scholars suggest that the original name of Kandy was Katubulu Nuwara located near the present [[Watapuluwa]]. However, the more popular historical name is Senkadagala or Senkadagalapura, officially Senkadagala Siriwardhana Maha Nuwara (meaning 'great city of Senkadagala of growing resplendence'), generally shortened to 'Maha Nuwara'. According to folklore, this name originated from one of the several possible sources. One being the city was named after a [[brahmin]] with the name Senkanda who lived in a cave nearby, and another being a queen of [[Vikramabahu III of Gampola|Vikramabahu III]] was named Senkanda, and after a coloured stone named Senkadagala. The [[Kingdom of Kandy]] has also been known by various names. The English name Kandy, which originated during the colonial era, is derived from an anglicised version of the [[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] Kanda Uda Rata (meaning the land on the mountain) or Kanda Uda Pas Rata (the five counties/countries on the mountain). The Portuguese shortened this to "Candea", using the name for both the kingdom and its capital. In Sinhala, Kandy is called ''Maha Nuwara'', meaning "Great City" or "The Capital", although this is most often shortened to ''Nuwara'' in daily use.<ref name="srilankanmap.com">{{cite web|title=Kandy Map|url=http://srilankanmap.com/kandymap.html|publisher=SriLankanMap|access-date=23 June 2011}}</ref>

== History ==
{{See also|History of Sri Lanka}}

=== Founding ===
Historical records suggest that Kandy was first established by the [[Vikramabahu III of Gampola|Vikramabahu III]] (1357–1374 AD), who was the monarch of the [[Kingdom of Gampola]], north of the present city, and named ''Senkadagalapura'' at the time.

{{History of Kandy}}

[[Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu of Kandy|Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu]] (1473–1511) was the first king of the [[Kingdom of Kandy]]. He was a royal from the Kotte Royal Bloodline and ruled Kandy as a semi-independent kingdom under the [[Kingdom of Kotte]], making it the new capital of the Kandyan Kingdom. Sena Sammatha Wickramabahu was followed by his son [[Jayaweera Astana of Kandy|Jayaweera Astana]] (1511–1551) and then by [[Karaliyadde Bandara of Kandy|Karaliyadde Bandara]] (1551–1581) who was succeeded by his daughter [[Dona Catherina of Kandy]] (1581–1581). Dona Catherina was succeeded by [[Rajasinha I of Sitawaka|Rajasinha I]]. Rajasinha I, however, preferred to rule the hill country from the [[Kingdom of Sitawaka]] on the west of the island. A period of turmoil for power ended with the ascent to the throne by Konappu Bandara who came to be known as [[Vimaladharmasuriya I of Kandy|Vimaladharmasuriya I]].  Having embraced Buddhism, he consolidated his authority further by bringing the [[Relic of the tooth of the Buddha|tooth relic of the Buddha]] to Kandy from a place called Delgamuwa.<ref name="srilankanmap.com" />

In 1592 Kandy became the capital city of the last remaining independent kingdom in the island after the coastal regions had been conquered by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]]. Several invasions by the Portuguese were repelled, most notably in the [[campaign of Danture]]. After the [[Sinhalese–Portuguese War]] and the establishment of [[Dutch Ceylon]], attempts by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] to conquer the kingdom were repelled.

The kingdom tolerated a Dutch presence on the coast of Sri Lanka, although attacks were occasionally launched. The most ambitious offensive was undertaken in 1761, when King [[Kirti Sri Rajasinha of Sri Lanka|Kirti Sri Rajasinha]] attacked and overran most of the coast, leaving only the heavily fortified [[Negombo]] intact. When a Dutch retaliatory force returned to the island in 1763, Kirti Sri Rajasinha abandoned the coastline and withdrew into the interior. When the Dutch continued to the jungles the next year, they were constantly harassed by disease, heat, lack of provisions, and Kandyan sharpshooters, who hid in the jungle and inflicted heavy losses on the Dutch.

The Dutch launched a better-adapted force [[Kandyan–Dutch war (1764–1766)|in January 1765]], replacing their troops' bayonets with machetes and using more practical uniforms and tactics suited to [[jungle warfare]]. The Dutch were initially successful in capturing the capital, which was deserted, and the Kandyans withdrew to the jungles once more, refusing to engage in open battle. However, the Dutch were again worn down by constant [[attrition warfare]]. [[Treaty of Batticaloa|A peace treaty]] was signed in 1766. The Dutch remained in control of the coastal areas until 1796, when Great Britain took them over (while the Netherlands was under French control) due to the [[Kew letters]] during the [[Napoleonic wars]]. British possession of these areas was formalized with the [[treaty of Amiens]] in 1802. The next year the British also invaded Kandy in what became known as the First Kandyan War but were repulsed.

As the capital, Kandy had become home to the [[relic of the tooth of the Buddha]] which symbolizes a 4th-century tradition that used to be linked to the [[Sinhala Kingdom|Sinhalese]] monarchy, since the protector of the relic was the ruler of the land. Thus the Royal Palace and the Temple of the Tooth were placed in close proximity to each other.

The last ruling dynasty of Kandy was the [[Nayaks of Kandy|Nayaks]]. Kandy stayed independent until the early 19th century.

[[File:Kandyan Convention.jpg|thumb|The [[Kandyan Convention]] signed between the British and the Kandyan chiefs in 1815]]
In the [[Second Kandyan War]], the British launched an invasion that met no resistance and reached the city on 10 February 1815. The first time Sri Lanka fully fell into the hands of a foreign power was in Kandy with the signing of the [[Kandyan Convention]] in 1815 at the [[Sri Dalada Maligawa]]. The king, [[Vikrama Rajasinha]] of Kandy who was of [[South Indian]] ancestry faced powerful opposition from the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] chieftains and sought to reduce his power. A successful coup was organized by the Sinhalese chieftains in which they accepted the British crown as their new king. This ended over 2500 years of [[List of Sri Lankan monarchs|Sinhalese monarchs]] and the line of [[List of Kandyan monarchs|Kandyan monarchs]] and Rajasinha was taken as prisoner. By 2 March 1815 the island's sovereignty was under that of the [[British Empire]]. A treaty known as the [[Kandyan Convention]] was signed between the British and the [[Radala]]s (Kandyan aristocrats).  The treaty was not signed by the deposed King but by members of his court and other dignitaries of the Kandyan Kingdom. With this treaty, Kandy recognized George III as its King and became a British protectorate. The last king of the kingdom [[Sri Vikrama Rajasinha]] was captured and taken as a royal prisoner by the British to [[Vellore Fort]] in southern India along with all claimants to the throne. Some of the family members were also exiled to [[Tanjore]] (now known as Thanjavur, in Tamil Nadu). Their erstwhile living place is still referred to as "Kandy Raja Aranmanai" on the eastern part of Thanjavur town on Old Mariamman Koil Road.

=== Colonial era ===
During the [[British Ceylon|British period]] in Sri Lanka, the history of Kandy and its townscape witnessed a rapid and drastic change and particularly after the [[Uva Rebellion]]. Sir Lowry is noted for recording in his Gazetteer "The story of English rule in the Kandyan country during the rebellion of 1818 cannot be related without shame...Hardly a member of the leading families remained alive...Those whom the sword and the gun had spared, [[cholera]] and [[small pox]] and privations had slain by the hundreds...Others became ignorant and apathetic. Any subsequent development efforts of the government for many years were only attempts begun and abandoned".<ref name="srilankanmap.com" />

In 1848 led by [[Gongalegoda Banda]] and [[Puran Appu]] saw the rebellion known as the [[Matale Rebellion]]. Prior to that the city and the country had been under British rule for 32 years, during which the British had expropriated the common land of the peasantry and reduced them to extreme poverty. The Kandyan villagers were forced to abandon their traditional way of life and become wage-workers in the abominable conditions that prevailed on these new estates and plantations that had been introduced. Despite all the pressure exerted by the colonials, the Kandyans refused. This forced the British to bring in hundreds of thousands of [[Tamil people|Tamil]] [[coolie]]s from southern India.

The rebellion began on 26 July 1848 with Gongalegoda Banda, crowned as king, and Puran Appu, as prime minister, and their main objective was to capture Kandy back from the British. The Matale Rebellion was a peasant revolt in the hands of the [[Common people]], the Kandyan leadership being totally wiped out after the [[Uva Rebellion]], marked the first step in a transition from the classic [[feudal]] form of anti-colonial revolt to modern independence struggles. The leadership was for the first time passed from the Kandyan provinces into the hands of ordinary people or non-aristocrats.

[[File:Map of Kandy and environs (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|thumb|left|Kandy and environs, incl the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Peradeniya|Royal Botanic Gardens]] at Peradeniya, ca 1914]]

In 1944, during [[World War II]], the [[South East Asia Command]] of the allies was moved to Kandy, where it remained until the end of the war.

=== Contemporary Kandy ===
It is the second-largest city of the island and the capital of the Central Province of modern Sri Lanka. Its geographic location has made it a major transportation hub in the island: while Kandy being the gateway to the Central Highlands<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysrilankaholidays.com/central-highlands.html|title=Central highlands (Hill country) of Sri Lanka|access-date=2010-10-24}}</ref> of Sri Lanka, the city can be reached by major motorways in every direction of the island. The railway line from Colombo, the seaport on the western coast runs via Kandy to the farthest point of Badulla<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysrilankaholidays.com/badulla.html|title=Badulla, Central Highlands of Sri Lanka|access-date=2010-10-24}}</ref> in the Central Highlands. The main roads Colombo-Kandy and Kandy-Nuwara Eliya<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysrilankaholidays.com/kandy-nuwara-eliya.html|title=Kandy – Nuwara Eliya Road|access-date=2010-10-24}}</ref> are two of the most scenic roads of Sri Lanka; Colombo-Kandy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mysrilankaholidays.com/colombo-kandy.html|title=Colombo – Kandy Road|access-date=2010-10-24}}</ref> road passes through the rubber, tea plantations and rice paddies, Kandy-Nuwara Eliya road cuts through paddy fields and seamless tea plantations. Both roads claw their way up winding, rounding over the rings of hills. Currently, feasibility studies are afoot for another highway between Colombo and Kandy via Kadawata and the scenic city of Katugastota.

The city of Kandy lies at an elevation of {{convert|465|m|ft}} above [[sea level]]. Its plan developed around two open spaces: an elongated square, at the end of which are the administration buildings of the old capital, and an artificial lake that is quadrangular in form. A public garden adds to the openness of the city's spatial organization.

Kandy has now grown out to encompass [[Peradeniya]], home to the University of Peradeniya and the Botanical Gardens, [[Katugastota]] to the north, and east to [[Kundasale]], [[Tennekumbura]] and [[Gurudeniya]].

==== Temple of the Tooth ====
{{Main|Temple of the Tooth}}
[[File:SL Kandy asv2020-01 img34 Sacred Tooth Temple.jpg|left|thumb|Temple of the Tooth Relic, Kandy.]]
On the north shore of the lake, which is enclosed by a parapet of white stone dating to the beginning of the 19th century, are the city's official religious monuments, including the [[Royal Palace of Kandy|Royal Palace]] and the [[Temple of the Tooth]], known as the Sri Dalada Maligawa (daḷadā māligāva). Reconstructed in the 18th century, the Sri Dalada Maligawa is built on a base of [[granite]] that was inspired by the [[temple]]s of Sri Lanka's former capital city, [[Anuradhapura]]. An array of materials ([[limestone]], [[marble]], sculpted [[wood]], [[ivory]], etc.) contribute to the richness of this temple. Throughout this small ''holy city'', a number of recent Buddhist [[monastery|monasteries]] can be found.

The monumental ensemble of Kandy is an example of construction that associates the Royal Palace and the Temple of the Tooth (''Palace of the tooth relic'') is the place that houses the [[relic of the tooth of the Buddha]]. Originally part of the Royal Palace complex of the Kandyan Kingdom, it is one of the holiest places of worship and pilgrimage for Buddhists around the world. It was the last of a series of temples built in the places where the relic, the actual palladium of the Sinhalese monarchy, was brought following the various relocations of the capital city.

The Palace of the Tooth relic, the palace complex and the holy city of Kandy are associated with the history of the dissemination of Buddhism. The temple is the product of the last peregrination of the relic of the tooth of Buddha and the testimony of a religion which continues to be practiced today.

The [[International Buddhist Museum]] nearby houses objects contributed by India, Gandhara, Bhutan, Nepal, Korea, Thailand, etc.<ref>[https://www.nation.lk/2011/09/18/eyefea7.htm The splendour of International Buddhist Museum, Kandy, The Nation, Mallika Etulgama, 2011/09/18]</ref> A 16-foot statue of Gautama Buddha, a replica of the [[Dharmachakra Pravartana Buddha at Sarnath|Sarnath Buddha]] is installed in front of the museum, gifted by the Government of India.

==== Royal Palace ====

It today houses the [[National Museum Kandy]] which holds an extensive collection of artefacts from both the Kandy Kingdom and the British colonial rule.

==== Lankatilaka Temple ====

An arched passage of the image house leads through a Mandapa (hall) into the inner sanctum which is decorated with floral designs. The two side walls and the ceiling are decorated with paintings. In the inner sanctum is a large seated image of the Buddha.

==== Gadaladeniya Temple ====

=== Leisure and entertainment ===
[[File:Sri lanka kandy esala perahera.jpg|left|thumb|Esala Perahera is the prominent cultural event of the city]]
Kandyans do many things for leisure and entertainment in the city. Kandy is popular due to the annual [[procession]] known as the [[Esala Perahera]],{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} in which one of the inner caskets used for covering the tooth relic of Buddha is taken in a grand procession through the streets of the city. This casket is taken on a royal [[Elephant|tusker]]. The procession includes traditional dancers and drummers, flag bearers of the provinces of the old Kandyan kingdom, the Nilames ([[Laity|lay]] custodians of temples ) wearing their traditional dresses, torch-bearers, and also the grandly attired elephant. This ceremony which is annually held in the months of July or August attracts large crowds from all parts of the country and also many foreign tourists.

[[Kandy City Centre]] is commercial and shopping complex open in 2005<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pfik.org/ |title=Home |website=pfik.org}}</ref> at Dalada Veediya.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sridaladamaligawa.lk/|title=Sri Dalada Maligawa|access-date=2010-10-24}}</ref> and is the most modern commercial complex in Kandy.

=== Literature, film and television ===
Much of the 1984 film ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' was shot in Kandy.

=== Sport ===
{{Main|Sport in Central Province, Sri Lanka|Sport in Sri Lanka}}
[[File:Pallekele International Cricket Stadium Main pavilion.jpg|thumb|[[Pallekele International Cricket Stadium]]]]
Kandy has produced national-level competitors in a wide range of sports, including [[cricket]], [[rugby union]], [[Association football]], [[swimming]], [[field hockey]], athletics, table tennis, boxing, basketball, golf, and even baseball, which has only been introduced into Kandy recently. Kandy has produced national captains of cricket and rugby and athletes that play at the highest level of all sports.

Unlike the rest of the country [[rugby union|rugby]] is the most popular sport in the region. This is because of the local rugby union club, [[Kandy Sports Club (Rugby)|Kandy Sports Club]] being the reigning Club Rugby Champions in the national league for almost a decade, as well as the fondness and support the local schools treat the sport with. The [[Singer Sri Lankan Airlines Rugby 7's]] tournament is an annual international rugby union event held at the local [[Bogambara Stadium]], attracting nations from all over the world.

Cricket is widely played in Kandy with the city having three first-class teams in the [[Premier Trophy]], [[Saracens Sports Club|Saracens]], [[Kandy Cricket Club]] and [[Kandy Youth Cricket Club]], as well as being the main city for the [[Lanka Premier League]] side [[Kandy Falcons]]. Kandy is host to the [[Sri Lanka national cricket team]] with two [[Test cricket|Test status]] grounds, [[Asgiriya Stadium|Asgiriya International Stadium]] and the newly built state-of-the-art [[Pallekele International Cricket Stadium]]. Both stadiums have held [[Cricket World Cup|World Cup]] matches. Other cricket venues are Katugastota Oval (St.Anthony's College ground), Lake View ground at [[Dharmaraja College]], and Police ground Kandy.

Sports like [[field hockey]], [[volleyball]] (the national sport of Sri Lanka), and [[association football]] however have not taken off in Kandy as much as other sports, due to the lack of proper playing fields, funding, and support. [[Cue games]] like billiards and snooker have hardly anyone playing. However, [[basketball]], [[table tennis]], [[badminton]], and [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] are common due to the high participation of students and schools.<ref>{{cite web|last=Marikar|first=Hafiz|title=A Look at Sports in Kandy|url=http://www.thesundayleader.lk/2010/12/26/a-look-at-sports-in-kandy/|publisher=The Sunday Leader|access-date=22 June 2011}}</ref>
