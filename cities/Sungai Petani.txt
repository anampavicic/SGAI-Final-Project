'''Sungai Petani'''  ([[abbr.]] '''Sg. Petani''' or '''SP)''' is a town in [[Kuala Muda District]], [[Kedah]], [[Malaysia]]. Sungai Petani is [[Kedah]]'s largest city and is located about 55&nbsp;km south of [[Alor Setar]], the capital of Kedah, and 33&nbsp;km northeast of [[George Town, Penang|George Town]], the capital city of the neighbouring state of [[Penang]].<ref name="stats">{{cite web|url=http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/03ringkasan_kawasan_PBT_Jadual1.pdf|title=Key Summary Statistics For Local Authority Areas, Malaysia 2010|publisher=Department of Statistics, Malaysia|accessdate=19 April 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205090002/http://www.statistics.gov.my/portal/download_Population/files/population/03ringkasan_kawasan_PBT_Jadual1.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2015}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name of the municipality is taken from the name of a river, which is ''Sungai Petani'' (Petani River), a tributary of Merbok River. The word ''Petani'' might be related to the province of [[Pattani province|Pattani]] in [[Thailand]]. The word is said to derive from a Sanskrit word 'pathini', meaning "virgin nymph"; Pathini was the name of a daughter of [[Merong Mahawangsa]], founder of the preceding [[Langkasuka|Langkasuka Empire]]. When Kedah was known under the name of Langkasuka, traders always travelled between Merbok Valley and Pattani, and the eastern parts of [[Peninsular Malaysia]] through land routes. Thus it is not impossible that the word 'Petani' is borrowed from the name of the princess.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBM/detail.php?ttl_id=41&spesifik_id=145&section=sm03 |title={ms} Sejarah Malaysia - Asal Usul nama Sungai Petani |publisher=Sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my |access-date=2012-08-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603132142/http://sejarahmalaysia.pnm.my/portalBM/detail.php?ttl_id=41&spesifik_id=145&section=sm03 |archive-date=2013-06-03 }}</ref>  "Petani" also means farmer in [[Malay language|Malay]], but it is unlikely that this is the origin of the city name as there are no sources pointing it to be the case.
