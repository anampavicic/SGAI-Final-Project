Warsaw traces its origins to a small fishing town in [[Masovia]]. The city rose to prominence in the late 16th century, when [[Sigismund III]] decided to move the Polish capital and his royal court from [[Kraków]]. Warsaw served as the de facto capital of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] until 1795, and subsequently as the seat of [[Napoleon]]'s [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. The 19th century and its [[Industrial Revolution]] brought a demographic boom, which made it one of the largest and most densely populated cities in Europe.

Warsaw is served by two international airports, the busiest being [[Warsaw Chopin Airport|Warsaw Chopin]], as well as the smaller [[Warsaw Modlin Airport|Warsaw Modlin]], intended for low-cost carriers. Major public transport services operating in the city include the [[Warsaw Metro]], [[Bus transport in Warsaw|buses]], [[Szybka Kolej Miejska (Warsaw)|commuter rail service]] and an extensive [[Trams in Warsaw|tram network]].

[[False etymology|Folk etymology]] attributes the city name to [[Wars and Sawa]]. There are several versions of the legend with their appearance. According to one version, Sawa was a mermaid living in the Vistula with whom fisherman Wars fell in love.<ref name=warsaw-legend/><ref name=syrenka_historia/> The official city name in full is {{lang|pl|miasto stołeczne Warszawa}} ("The Capital City of Warsaw").<ref name=prawo_lex/>

The first fortified settlements on the site of today's Warsaw were located in [[Bródno]] (9th/10th century) and [[Ujazdów Castle|Jazdów]] (12th/13th century).<ref name="history"/> After Jazdów was raided by nearby clans and dukes, a new fortified settlement was established on the site of a small fishing village called "Warszowa". The Prince of [[Płock]], Bolesław II of Masovia, established the modern-day city in about 1300 and the first historical document attesting to the existence of a [[castellan]]y dates to 1313.<ref name="views">{{cite book |author=Dobrosław Kobielski |title=Widoki dawnej Warszawy (Views of Old Warsaw) |year=1984 |publisher=Krajowa Agencja Wydawnicza |location=Warsaw |isbn=83-03-00702-5 |language=pl}}</ref> With the completion of [[St. John's Archcathedral, Warsaw|St John's Cathedral]] in 1390, Warsaw became one of the seats of the [[Duke of Masovia|Dukes of Masovia]] and was officially made capital of the [[Duchy of Masovia|Masovian Duchy]] in 1413.<ref name="history"/> The economy then predominantly rested on craftsmanship or trade, and the town housed approximately 4,500 people at the time.

During the 15th century, the population migrated and spread beyond the northern city wall into a newly formed self-governing precinct called [[Warsaw New Town|New Town]]. The existing older settlement became eventually known as the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]]. Both possessed their own town charter and independent councils. The aim of establishing a separate district was to accommodate new incomers or "undesirables" who were not permitted to settle in Old Town, particularly [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]].<ref name="Davies">{{cite book |last=Davies |first=Norman |title=God's Playground |url=https://archive.org/details/godsplaygroundhi00norm_0 |url-access=registration |edition=2 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2005 |isbn=0-19-925339-0}}</ref> Social and financial disparities between the classes in the two precincts led to a minor revolt in 1525.<ref name="views"/> Following the sudden death of [[Janusz III of Masovia|Janusz III]] and the extinction of the local ducal line, Masovia was incorporated into the [[Kingdom of Poland]] in 1526.<ref name="history"/> [[Bona Sforza]], wife of [[Sigismund I of Poland]], was widely accused of poisoning the duke to uphold Polish rule over Warsaw.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://muzeumwarszawy.pl/obiekt/fragment-szaty-ksiazat-mazowieckich/ |title=Fragment szaty książąt mazowieckich |website=Muzeum Warszawy |access-date=21 June 2020 |archive-date=8 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808001447/https://muzeumwarszawy.pl/obiekt/fragment-szaty-ksiazat-mazowieckich/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://przekroj.pl/nauka/malo-czarujacy-koniec-piastow-mazowieckich-adam-weglowski |title=Mało czarujący koniec Piastów mazowieckich – Kwartalnik Przekrój |website=przekroj.pl |date=20 February 2018 |access-date=19 June 2020 |archive-date=28 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201028113311/https://przekroj.pl/nauka/malo-czarujacy-koniec-piastow-mazowieckich-adam-weglowski |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1529, Warsaw for the first time became the seat of a [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|General Sejm]] and held that privilege permanently from 1569.<ref name="history"/> The city's rising importance encouraged the construction of a new set of defenses, including the landmark [[Warsaw Barbican|Barbican]]. Renowned [[Italian architecture|Italian architects]] were brought to Warsaw to reshape the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]], the streets and the marketplace, resulting in the Old Town's early Italianate appearance. In 1573, the city gave its name to the [[Warsaw Confederation]] which formally established religious freedom in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Due to its central location between the capitals of the Commonwealth's two component parts, Poland and Lithuania, which were [[Kraków]] and [[Vilnius]] respectively, Warsaw became the capital of the Commonwealth and the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish Crown]] when [[Sigismund III Vasa]] transferred his royal court in 1596.<ref name="history"/> In the subsequent years the town significantly expanded to the south and westwards. Several private independent districts (''[[jurydyka]]'') were the property of aristocrats and the gentry, which they ruled by their own laws. Between 1655 and 1658 the city was besieged and pillaged by the Swedish, [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburgian]] and [[Transylvania]]n forces.<ref name="history"/><ref name=Ascheron/> The conduct of the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721) also forced Warsaw to pay heavy tributes to the invading armies.<ref name="timeline"/>

The reign of [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]] and [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]] was a time of great development for Warsaw, which turned into an early-capitalist city. The [[Saxony|Saxon]] monarchs employed many German architects, sculptors and engineers, who rebuilt the city in a style similar to [[Dresden]]. The year 1727 marked the opening of the [[Saxon Garden]] in Warsaw, the first publicly accessible park.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://zom.waw.pl/statics/static-maps/file/Ogr%c3%b3d%20Saski%20PDF_1439287908.pdf |title=Ogród Saski|language=pl|access-date=27 November 2020 |archive-date=8 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201208160642/https://zom.waw.pl/statics/static-maps/file/Ogr%C3%B3d%20Saski%20PDF_1439287908.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Załuski Library]], the first Polish public library and the largest at the time, was founded in 1747.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://free.polbox.pl/p/psbor/eniema.htm |title=The Bygone Warsaw |date=14 March 2008 |access-date=18 November 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314193715/http://free.polbox.pl/p/psbor/eniema.htm |archive-date=14 March 2008}}</ref> [[Stanisław II Augustus]], who remodelled the interior of the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]], also made Warsaw a centre of culture and the arts.<ref name=Rozek/><ref name=Stanley/> He extended the [[Royal Baths Park]] and ordered the construction or refurbishment of numerous palaces, mansions and richly-decorated tenements.

Warsaw flourished throughout the 19th century under Mayor [[Sokrates Starynkiewicz]] (1875–92), who was appointed by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. Under Starynkiewicz Warsaw saw its first water and sewer systems designed and built by the English engineer [[William Lindley]] and his son, [[William Heerlein Lindley]], as well as the expansion and modernisation of trams, street lighting, and gas infrastructure.<ref name="history"/> Between 1850 and 1882, the population grew by 134% to 383,000 as a result of rapid urbanisation and industrialisation. Many migrated from surrounding rural Masovian towns and villages to the city for employment opportunities. The western borough of [[Wola]] was transformed from an agricultural periphery occupied mostly by small farms and windmills (mills being the namesake of Wola's central neighbourhood [[Młynów, Warsaw|Młynów]]) to an industrial and manufacturing centre.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://warszawa.wyborcza.pl/warszawa/1,34885,3653279.html?disableRedirects=true |title=Wyborcza.pl |website=warszawa.wyborcza.pl |access-date=21 June 2020 |archive-date=22 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622133846/https://warszawa.wyborcza.pl/warszawa/1,34885,3653279.html?disableRedirects=true |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Metallurgy|Metallurgical]], textile and glassware factories were commonplace, with chimneys dominating the westernmost skyline.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sarp.warszawa.pl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/H.Radziejowska_Wola_przemys%C5%82.pdf |title=Wola przemysł|language=pl|access-date=21 June 2020 |archive-date=23 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923145313/https://sarp.warszawa.pl/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/H.Radziejowska_Wola_przemys%C5%82.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Like [[London]], Warsaw's population was subjected to income segmentation. Gentrification of inner suburbs forced poorer residents to move across the river into [[Praga]] or [[Powiśle, Warsaw|Powiśle]] and [[Solec, Warsaw|Solec]] districts, similar to the [[East End of London]] and [[London Docklands]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://warszawa.wyborcza.pl/warszawa/1,34862,17781069,Gentryfikacja_w_Warszawie__nie_patrzec_slepo_na__wzorce.html?disableRedirects=true |title=Wyborcza.pl |website=warszawa.wyborcza.pl |access-date=21 June 2020 |archive-date=22 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622165610/https://warszawa.wyborcza.pl/warszawa/1,34862,17781069,Gentryfikacja_w_Warszawie__nie_patrzec_slepo_na__wzorce.html?disableRedirects=true |url-status=live }}</ref> Poorer religious and ethnic minorities, such as the Jews, settled in the crowded parts of northern Warsaw, in [[Muranów]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.masaperlowa.pl/zydowska-warszawa-wspolczesnie/ |title=Żydowska Warszawa.

During [[World War I]], Warsaw was occupied by Germany from 4 August 1915 until November 1918. The [[Armistice of 11 November 1918]] concluded that defeated Germany is to withdraw from all foreign areas, which included Warsaw.<ref name=Wandycz/> Germany did so, and underground leader [[Józef Piłsudski]] returned to Warsaw on the same day which marked the beginning of the [[Second Polish Republic]], the first truly sovereign Polish state after 1795. In the course of the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919–1921), the 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]] was fought on the eastern outskirts of the city. Poland successfully defended the capital, stopped the brunt of the Bolshevik [[Red Army]] and temporarily halted the "[[export of revolution|export of the communist revolution]]" to other parts of Europe.<ref name=Zamoyski/>

The interwar period (1918–1939) was a time of major development in the city's infrastructure. New [[modernism|modernist]] housing estates were built in [[Mokotów]] to de-clutter the densely populated inner suburbs. In 1921, Warsaw's total area was estimated at only 124.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> with 1 million inhabitants–over 8,000 people/km<sup>2</sup> made Warsaw more densely populated than contemporary London.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://datablog.pl/wykres-powierzchnia-warszawy-w-latach-1921-2008/#:~:text=Historyczne%20dane%20G%C5%82%C3%B3wnego%20Urz%C4%99du%20Statystycznego,ona%20oko%C5%82o%20517%20km%20kwadratowych. |title=Powierzchnia Warszawy w latach 1921-2008 |date=16 February 2015 |access-date=19 June 2020 |archive-date=21 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200621102100/http://datablog.pl/wykres-powierzchnia-warszawy-w-latach-1921-2008/#:~:text=Historyczne%20dane%20G%C5%82%C3%B3wnego%20Urz%C4%99du%20Statystycznego,ona%20oko%C5%82o%20517%20km%20kwadratowych. |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Średnicowy Bridge]] was constructed for railway (1921–1931), connecting both parts of the city across the [[Vistula]].

After the German [[Invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939 started the Second World War, Warsaw [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|was defended]] until 27 September. Central Poland, including Warsaw, came under the rule of the [[General Government]], a German [[Nazism|Nazi]] colonial administration. All higher education institutions were immediately closed and Warsaw's entire Jewish population – several hundred thousand, some 30% of the city{{spaced ndash}}were herded into the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].<ref name=ushmm/> In July 1942, the Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto began to be deported en masse to the [[Aktion Reinhard]] extermination camps, particularly [[Treblinka]].<ref name=ushmm/> The city would become the centre of urban resistance to Nazi rule in occupied Europe.<ref name=Snyder/> When the order came to annihilate the ghetto as part of [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]'s "[[Final Solution]]" on 19 April 1943, Jewish fighters launched the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]].<ref name="ghettouprising"/> Despite being heavily outgunned and outnumbered, the ghetto held out for almost a month.<ref name="ghettouprising"/> When the fighting ended, almost all survivors were massacred, with only a few managing to escape or hide.<ref name="ghettouprising"/><ref name=aish/>

[[File:Powstanie Warszawskie film Joachmiczyk.jpg|thumb|190px|The [[Warsaw Uprising]] took place in 1944. The [[Armia Krajowa|Polish Home Army]] attempted to liberate Warsaw from the Germans before the arrival of the [[Red Army]].<ref name=britannica/>]]

By July 1944, the [[Red Army]] was deep into Polish territory and pursuing the Nazis toward Warsaw.<ref name="uprising"/> The [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London gave orders to the underground [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army (AK)]] to try to seize control of Warsaw before the Red Army arrived.

In 1945, after the bombings, revolts, fighting, and demolition had ended, most of Warsaw lay in ruins. The area of the former ghetto was razed to the ground, with only a sea of rubble remaining. The immense destruction prompted a temporary transfer of the new government and its officials to [[Łódź]], which became the transitional seat of power. Nevertheless, Warsaw officially resumed its role as the capital of Poland and the country's centre of political and economic life.

After World War II, the "Bricks for Warsaw" campaign was initiated and large prefabricated housing projects were erected in Warsaw to address the major housing shortage. [[Plattenbau]]-styled apartment buildings were seen as a solution to avoid Warsaw's former density problem and to create more green spaces. Some of the buildings from the 19th century that had survived in a reasonably reconstructible form were nonetheless demolished in the 1950s and 1960s, like the [[Leopold Stanisław Kronenberg|Kronenberg Palace]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/warsaws-lost-architecture-portrayed-in-miniature/ |title=Warsaw's lost architecture portrayed in miniature |website=[[The Times of Israel]] |access-date=11 June 2017 |archive-date=22 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322044051/http://www.timesofisrael.com/warsaws-lost-architecture-portrayed-in-miniature/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.warszawa1939.pl/index.php?r1=malachowskiego_4&r3=0 |title=Pałac Leopolda Kronenberga |work=warszawa1939.pl |access-date=29 July 2008 |language=pl |archive-date=6 December 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206061000/http://www.warszawa1939.pl/index.php?r1=malachowskiego_4&r3=0 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Śródmieście, Warsaw|Śródmieście]] (central) region's urban system was completely reshaped; former cobblestone streets were [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]]ed and significantly widened for traffic use.

The left one is situated both on the [[moraine]] plateau ({{convert|10|to|25|m|abbr=on}} above Vistula level) and on the Vistula terraces (max. {{convert|6.5|m|abbr=on}} above Vistula level). The significant element of the relief, in this part of Warsaw, is the edge of moraine plateau called Warsaw Escarpment. It is {{convert|20|to|25|m|abbr=on}} high in the Old Town and Central district and about {{convert|10|m|abbr=on}} in the north and south of Warsaw. It goes through the city and plays an important role as a landmark.

The plain moraine plateau has only a few natural and artificial ponds and also groups of [[clay pit]]s. The pattern of the Vistula terraces is asymmetrical. The left side consists mainly of two levels: the highest one contains former flooded terraces and the lowest one is the floodplain terrace. The contemporary flooded terrace still has visible valleys and ground [[depression (geology)|depressions]] with water systems coming from the old Vistula&nbsp;– riverbed. They consist of still quite natural streams and lakes as well as the pattern of drainage ditches. The right side of Warsaw has a different pattern of geomorphological forms. There are several levels of the Vistula plain terraces (flooded as well as formerly flooded), and only a small part is a not-so-visible moraine escarpment. [[Aeolian processes|Aeolian]] sand with a number of dunes parted by [[peat]] swamps or small ponds cover the highest terrace. These are mainly forested areas ([[Temperate coniferous forest|pine forest]]).

{{Main|Architecture of Warsaw}}
<!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION -->

Warsaw's long and eclectic history left a noticeable mark on its architecture and urban form. Unlike most Polish cities, Warsaw's cityscape is mostly [[contemporary architecture|contemporary]] – modern glass buildings are towering above older historical edifices which is a common feature of [[North America]]n metropolises. Warsaw is among the European cities with the highest number of skyscrapers and is home to [[Varso|European Union's tallest building]]. Skyscrapers are mostly centered around the [[Śródmieście, Warsaw|Śródmieście]] district, with many located in the commercial district of [[Wola]]. A [[Concentric zone model|concentric zone pattern]] emerged within the last decades; the majority of Warsaw's residents live outside the commercial city centre and commute by [[Warsaw metro|metro]], bus or tram.<ref name="auto">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b07CCAAAQBAJ&q=model+koncentryczny+warszawa&pg=PA29 |title=PRZEKSZTAŁCENIA PRZESTRZENNEGO ROZMIESZCZENIA ZASOBÓW MIESZKANIOWYCH W WARSZAWIE W LATACH 1945–2008 |first=Marcin |last=Stępniak |date=25 March 2015 |publisher=IGiPZ PAN |isbn=9788361590361 |via=Google Books |access-date=22 November 2020 |archive-date=16 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816230648/https://books.google.com/books?id=b07CCAAAQBAJ&q=model+koncentryczny+warszawa&pg=PA29 |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Tenement]]s and apartments in the central neighbourhoods are often reserved for commercial activity or temporary (tourist, student) accommodation. The nearest residential zones are predominantly located on the outskirts of the inner borough, in [[Ochota]], [[Mokotów]] and [[Żoliborz]] or along the [[Vistula]] in [[Powiśle, Warsaw|Powiśle]].<ref name="auto"/>

A seat of [[Polish monarchs]] since the end of the 16th century, Warsaw remained a small city with only privately owned palaces, mansions, villas and several streets of townhouses. These displayed a richness of color and architectonic details. The finest German, Italian and Dutch architects were employed, among them [[Tylman van Gameren]], [[Andreas Schlüter]], [[Jakub Fontana]], and [[Enrico Marconi]].<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Az48AAAAMAAJ&q=warszawa+architekt+z+w%C5%82och,+niemiec+niderland%C3%B3w |title=Cztery wieki Mazowsza: Szkice z dziejów, 1526-1914 |year=1968 |publisher=Nasza Księgarnia |access-date=21 June 2020 |archive-date=8 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220108031304/https://www.google.com.au/books/edition/Cztery_wieki_Mazowsza/Az48AAAAMAAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&bsq=warszawa+architekt+z+w%C5%82och%2C+niemiec+niderland%C3%B3w&dq=warszawa+architekt+z+w%C5%82och%2C+niemiec+niderland%C3%B3w&printsec=frontcover |url-status=live }}</ref> The buildings situated in the vicinity of the [[Warsaw Old Town]] represent nearly every European architectural style and [[List of time periods|historical period]]. Warsaw has excellent examples of architecture from the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] periods, all of which are located within walking distance of the centre. This architectural richness has led to Warsaw being described by some commentators as a "[[Paris of the East (disambiguation)|Paris of the East]]".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Galloway |first1=Lindsey |title=The secrets hiding in Warsaw, the Paris of the East |url=https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180304-the-secrets-hiding-in-warsaw-the-paris-of-the-east |website=www.bbc.com |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=3 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531040740/https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20180304-the-secrets-hiding-in-warsaw-the-paris-of-the-east |archive-date=31 May 2023 |language=en |date=5 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Gothic architecture is represented in the majestic churches but also at the [[Middle class|burgher]] houses and fortifications. The most significant buildings are [[St. John's Cathedral, Warsaw|St John's Cathedral]] (1390), a typical example of the so-called Masovian [[Brick Gothic]] style; [[Church of the Visitation of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Warsaw|St Mary's Church]] (1411); the Burbach [[townhouse]] (14th century);<ref>{{cite web |url=http://um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/perelki/index_en.php?mi_id=43&dz_id=2 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070528001130/http://um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/perelki/index_en.php?mi_id=43&dz_id=2 |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 May 2007 |title=A town house of the Burbach family |work=eGuide / Treasures of Warsaw on-line |access-date=23 February 2009}}</ref> Gunpowder Tower (after 1379); and [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]]'s ''Curia Maior'' (1407–1410). The most notable examples of [[Renaissance architecture]] in the city are the house of the Baryczko merchant family (1562), a building called "The Negro" (early 17th century), and Salwator tenement (1632), all situated on the [[Old Town Market Place, Warsaw|Old Market Place]]. The most interesting examples of [[Mannerism|Mannerist]] architecture are the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] (1596–1619) and the [[Jesuit Church, Warsaw|Jesuit Church]] (1609–1626).

[[File:Hotel Bristol, Warszawa.jpg|left|thumb|upright|[[Hotel Bristol, Warsaw|Hotel Bristol]] is a unique example of Warsaw's architectural heritage, combining [[Art Nouveau]] and [[Neo-Renaissance]] designs.]]

[[Baroque architecture]] arrived in Warsaw at the turn of the 16th and 17th centuries with the artists from the court circle of King [[Sigismund III Vasa]] (the early Warsaw Baroque is referred to as Vasa Baroque). Among the first structures of the early Baroque, the most important are [[St. Hyacinth's Church, Warsaw|St. Hyacinth's Church]] and [[Sigismund's Column]], the first secular monument in the form of a column in modern history.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://zyciestolicy.com.pl/wyremontuja-kolumne-zygmunta-iii-wazy-za-ponad-230-tys-zlotych/ |title=Wyremontują kolumnę Zygmunta III Wazy za ponad 230 tys. złotych! |first=przez |last=Redakcja |date=21 January 2020 |access-date=21 June 2020 |archive-date=22 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200622120624/https://zyciestolicy.com.pl/wyremontuja-kolumne-zygmunta-iii-wazy-za-ponad-230-tys-zlotych/ |url-status=live }}</ref> At that time, part of the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]] was rebuilt in this style, the [[Ujazdów Castle]] and numerous Baroque palaces on the [[Vistula]] escarpment were constructed. In the architecture of Catholic churches, the [[Counter-Reformation]] type became a novelty, exemplified by the [[Church of St. Anthony of Padua, Warsaw|Church of St. Anthony of Padua]], the [[Carmelite Church, Warsaw|Carmelite Church]] and the [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw|Holy Cross Church]].<ref name="barok"/>

Warsaw Baroque from the turn of the 17th and 18th centuries was characterized by building facades with a predominance of vertical elements close to the wall and numerous [[ornament (art)|ornaments]]. The most important architect working in Warsaw at that time was [[Tylman van Gameren]]. His projects include the [[Krasiński Palace]], [[Palace of the Four Winds]], [[Ostrogski Palace]], [[Czapski Palace]], [[Brühl Palace, Warsaw|Brühl Palace]], and [[St. Kazimierz Church]]. The most significant Baroque building of this period is the [[Wilanów Palace]], built on the order of King [[John III Sobieski]].<ref name="barok"/>

The late Baroque era was the epoch of the [[Personal union of Poland and Saxony|Saxon Kings]] (1697–1763). During this time, three major spatial projects were realized: the 880-meter Piaseczyński Canal on the axis of [[Ujazdów Castle]], the [[Ujazdów Avenue, Warsaw|Ujazdów Calvary]] and the [[Saxon Axis]]. The [[Visitationist Church]] also dates from this period.<ref name="barok">{{Cite web|url=https://edukacjamedialna.edu.pl/lekcje/warszawski-barok/|title=Warszawski barok|website=edukacjamedialna.edu.pl|access-date=21 January 2024|archive-date=8 July 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240708093526/https://edukacjamedialna.edu.pl/lekcje/warszawski-barok/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The [[neoclassical architecture]] began to be the main style in the capital's architecture in Warsaw in the second half of the 18th century thanks to King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]]. It can be described by the simplicity of the geometrical forms teamed with a great inspiration from the Roman period. The best-known architect who worked in Warsaw at the time was [[Domenico Merlini]], who designed the [[Łazienki Palace|Palace on the Isle]]. Other significant buildings from this period include [[Królikarnia]], [[Holy Trinity Church, Warsaw|Holy Trinity Church]], [[St. Anne's Church, Warsaw]].

Also in the first half of the 19th century, [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassicism]] dominated the architecture of Warsaw. Old buildings were rebuilt and new ones were built in this style. The neoclassical revival affected all aspects of architecture; the most notable examples are the [[Great Theatre, Warsaw|Great Theater]], buildings located at [[Plac Bankowy, Warsaw|Bank Square]], headquarters of the [[Warsaw Society of Friends of Learning|Warsaw Society of Friends of Sciences]] ([[Staszic Palace]]), [[St. Alexander's Church, Warsaw|St. Alexander's Church]], the [[Belweder]]. Many classicist tenement houses were built on Senatorska Street and along [[New World Street, Warsaw|Nowy Świat Street]]. After the outbreak of the [[November Uprising]], the [[Warsaw Citadel]] was constructed in the north of the city, and the [[Saxon Palace]] underwent a complete reconstruction, where the central body of the building was demolished and replaced by a monumental 11-bay [[colonnade]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://varsavianista.pl/index.php/2023/12/11/rozwoj-warszawy-w-drugiej-polowie-xix-w/|title=Architektura warszawska pierwszej połowy XIX w. |website=varsavianista.pl |author=Jerzy S.

In the mid-19th century, the industrial revolution reached Warsaw, leading to the mass use of iron as a building material. In 1845, the [[Warsaw–Vienna railway|Warsaw-Vienna Railway Station]] was opened. Another important aspect of the developing city was ensuring access to water and sewage disposal. The first modern Warsaw water supply system was launched in 1855, designed by one of the most outstanding architects of that period – [[Enrico Marconi]], who designed also [[All Saints Church, Warsaw|All Saints Church]]. The dynamic development of the railway became a factor that enabled equally dynamic development of Warsaw's industry. Among the establishments built at that time were the [[E. Wedel|Wedel factory]] and the extensive [[Warsaw Gasworks Museum|Municipal Gasworks complex]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://varsavianista.pl/index.php/2023/12/21/architektura-warszawska-pierwszej-polowy-xix-w|title=Rozwój Warszawy w drugiej połowie XIX w.  |website=varsavianista.pl |author=Ryszard Mączewski  |date=21 December 2023 |access-date=21 January 2024}}</ref>

In the architecture of the 1920s, national historicism and other historical forms were dominant. [[Art Deco]] forms also appeared, and towards the end of the decade, avant-garde functionalism emerged. The creation of urban plans for the capital of Poland can be traced back to 1916, when, after the [[Great Retreat (Russia)|retreat of the Russians]] from Warsaw and the beginnings of the German occupation, the territories of the surrounding municipalities were annexed to the city. Even before Poland regained its independence, parallel to the creation of the administration of the future state, the first urban visions were emerging. These included, among others, the construction of a representative government district in the southern part of [[Śródmieście, Warsaw|Śródmieście]]. However, major changes in urban planning and the architectural landscape of the city only began in the mid-1920s. The forming state structures needed headquarters, leading to the construction of many monumental public buildings, including the [[Sejm and Senate Complex|buildings of the Sejm and the Senate]], the [[Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education (Poland)|Ministry of Religious Affairs and Public Education]], the [[Ministry of Infrastructure (Poland)|Ministry of Public Works]], the [[Warsaw National Museum|National Museum]], the [[Geological Museum of the State Geological Institute|State Geological Institute]], the State Agricultural Bank, the [[Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego|Domestic Economy Bank]], the directorate of the [[Polish State Railways]], the [[Supreme Audit Office (Poland)|Supreme Audit Office]], and the campus of the [[SGH Warsaw School of Economics|Warsaw School of Economics]]. New districts were also established in [[Żoliborz]], [[Ochota]], and [[Mokotów]], often designed around a central square with radiating streets ([[Narutowicz Square]], [[Wilson Square]]). Examples of new large urban projects are the Staszic and [[Kolonia Lubeckiego|Lubecki colonies]] in [[Ochota]].<ref name="20s">{{Cite web |url=https://varsavianista.pl/index.php/2023/12/29/architektura-warszawy-lat-20-xx-w/ |title=Architektura Warszawy lat 20.

Exceptional examples of the [[bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] architecture of the later periods were not restored by the [[communism|communist]] authorities after the war or were remodelled into a socialist realist style (like [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra|Warsaw Philharmonic]] edifice originally inspired by [[Palais Garnier]] in [[Paris]]).

Although contemporary Warsaw is a fairly young city compared to other European capitals, it has numerous [[tourist attraction]]s and architectural monuments dating back centuries. Apart from the [[Warsaw Old Town]] area, reconstructed after World War II, each borough has something to offer. Among the most notable landmarks of the Old Town are the [[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle]], [[Sigismund's Column]], [[Old Town Market Place, Warsaw|Market Square]], and the [[Warsaw Barbican|Barbican]].

Further south is the so-called [[Royal Route, Warsaw|Royal Route]], with many historical churches, [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] and [[classicism|Classicist]] palaces, most notably the [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace]], and the [[University of Warsaw]] campus. The former royal residence of King [[John III Sobieski]] at [[Wilanów Palace|Wilanów]] is notable for its Baroque architecture and eloquent palatial garden.<ref name=wilanow-palac/>

[[File:Zamek Królewski nocą w Warszawie widok od strony ogrodów królewskich.jpg|thumb|[[Royal Castle, Warsaw|Royal Castle's]] [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] façade]]

In many places in the city the [[Jewish culture]] and [[History of the Jews in Poland|history]] resonates down through time.<ref name="judaica"/> Among them the most notable are the [[Jewish Theatre, Warsaw|Jewish theater]], the [[Nożyk Synagogue]], [[Janusz Korczak]]'s Orphanage and the picturesque Próżna Street.<ref name="judaica"/> The tragic pages of Warsaw's history are commemorated in places such as the [[Monument to the Ghetto Heroes]], the [[Umschlagplatz (Warsaw Ghetto)|Umschlagplatz]], fragments of the ghetto wall on Sienna Street and a mound in memory of the [[Jewish Combat Organization]].<ref name="judaica"/>

Many places commemorate the heroic history of Warsaw such as [[Pawiak]], a German [[Gestapo]] prison now occupied by a [[Mausoleum]] of Memory of [[Martyr]]dom and a museum. The [[Warsaw Citadel]], a 19th-century fortification built after the defeat of the [[November Uprising]], was a place of martyrdom for the Poles. Another important monument, the statue of [[Mały Powstaniec|Little Insurrectionist]] located at the ramparts of the Old Town, commemorates the children who served as messengers and frontline troops in the Warsaw Uprising, while the [[Warsaw Uprising Monument]] by Wincenty Kućma was erected in memory of the largest insurrection of World War II.<ref name="heroic"/><ref name=Montagu/>

In Warsaw there are many places connected with the life and work of [[Frédéric Chopin]] who was born near the city in [[Żelazowa Wola]]. The heart of the Polish composer is sealed inside Warsaw's [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw|Holy Cross Church]].<ref name=Holy_Cross/> During the summer time the [[Chopin Statue, Warsaw|Chopin Statue]] in Łazienki Park is a place where pianists give concerts to the park audience.<ref name=Chopin_Monument/>

Also many references to [[Marie Curie]], her work and her family can be found in Warsaw; Curie's birthplace at the [[Warsaw New Town]], the working places where she did her first scientific works<ref name=aip1/> and the [[Curie Institute (Warsaw)|Radium Institute]] at Wawelska Street for the research and the treatment of which she founded in 1925.<ref name=aip2/>

===Cemeteries===
[[File:Kościół pw. św. Karola Boromeusza na tle śródmieścia Warszawy.jpg|thumb|Church of [[Charles Borromeo|Saint Charles Borromeo]] in [[Powązki Cemetery|Stare Powązki]]]]
The oldest [[necropolis]] in Warsaw is [[Powązki Cemetery|Stare Powązki]], established in 1790. It is one of Poland's national necropolises.<ref name="cmentarze">{{Cite web |url= https://dzieje.pl/wiadomosci/warszawskie-cmentarze-czyli-historia-polski-i-warszawy-w-pigulce |title=Warszawskie cmentarze, czyli historia Polski i Warszawy w pigułce |access-date=19 January 2024}}</ref>

The cemetery covers an area of 43 ha. On the day of consecration of the Powązki Cemetery, the foundation stone was laid for the construction of the church of [[Charles Borromeo|Saint Charles Borromeo]], designed by the royal architect [[Domenico Merlini]]. Catacombs were intended to be a prestigious resting place intended mainly for the nobles, such as [[Michał Jerzy Poniatowski|Michał Poniatowski]], [[Hugo Kołłątaj]], [[Michał Kazimierz Ogiński]]. Over a million people are buried at Stare Powązki. In the Avenue of Merit there are the graves of insurgents and soldiers, independence activists, writers, poets, scientists, artists and thinkers.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://um.warszawa.pl/-/stare-powazki-wszystkie-groby-policzone-i-opisane |title=Stare Powązki – wszystkie groby policzone i opisane |access-date=19 January 2024}}</ref> The nearby [[Powązki Military Cemetery]] was established in 1912 for soldiers stationed in Warsaw. After [[World War II]], the cemetery became a burial place for people associated with the [[Polish People's Republic]] - politicians, officials and military personnel.<ref name="cmentarze"/>

The complex of non-Roman Catholic cemeteries consists of [[Evangelical–Augsburg Cemetery, Warsaw|Evangelical–Augsburg Cemetery]], [[Evangelical Reformed Cemetery, Warsaw|Evangelical Reformed Cemetery]], [[Jewish Cemetery, Warsaw|Jewish Cemetery]], [[Orthodox Cemetery, Warsaw|Orthodox Cemetery]] and Muslim Tatar Cemetery.<ref name="cmentarze"/> Other significant Warsaw necropolises are: [[Bródno Cemetery]] [[Warsaw Insurgents Cemetery]], [[Służew Old Cemetery]], [[Służew New Cemetery]]. There are two large municipal cemeteries in the city – [[Northern Communal Cemetery]] and Southern Communal Cemetery.

===Memorials===
The city's symbol is the [[Mermaid of Warsaw|mermaid]] placed in the capital's coat of arms. There are three mermaid monuments in Warsaw: one on the banks of the [[Vistula]], the second on the [[Old Town Market Place, Warsaw|Old Town Square]], and the third in [[Praga-Południe]]. The oldest monument in Warsaw is the [[Sigismund's Column]]. It was built in 1644 according to the design of the Italians: Augustine Locci and Constantin Tencall. The King of Poland [[Sigismund III Vasa]] stands on a 22-meter high tower, holding a cross and a sword in his hand. The monument was destroyed and rebuilt many times.<ref name="pomniki">{{Cite web |url= https://viacitymap.pl/Miasta/Warszawa/Artykuly/Wazne-pomniki-w-Warszawie |title=Ważne pomniki w Warszawie |access-date=19 January 2024}}</ref>

Many monuments commemorate heroic and tragic moments in the history of Poland and Warsaw. [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw|The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] located in [[Piłsudski Square]] was built on the initiative of General [[Władysław Sikorski]] in the arcades of the [[Saxon Palace]]. In 1925, the ashes of the unknown soldier who died during the [[Battle of Lemberg (1918)|defense of Lviv]] were placed under the colonnade, then urns with soil from 24 battlefields were buried here. Among the monuments related to the [[World War II]] are [[Monument to the Heroes of Warsaw|Nike Monument]] that commemorates the heroes of Warsaw from 1939 to 1945, [[Monument to the Polish Underground State and Home Army]], Monument to the [[Little Insurrectionist]] and [[Warsaw Uprising Monument]] in front of the Supreme Court building at [[Krasiński Square]]. [[Monument to the Ghetto Heroes]] commemorates the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943.<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://viacitymap.pl/Miasta/Warszawa/Artykuly/Wazne-pomniki-w-Warszawie |title=WARSZAWSKIE POMNIKI |access-date=19 January 2024}}</ref>

In 1929, a [[Frédéric Chopin Monument, Warsaw|Frédéric Chopin's monument]] was constructed in the Royal [[Łazienki Park]].  Every summer at its foot classical music concerts featuring world-famous pianists take place. Other important monuments are: [[Adam Mickiewicz Monument, Warsaw|Adam Mickiewicz Monument]], [[Tadeusz Kościuszko Monument, Warsaw|Tadeusz Kościuszko Monument]], Marie Curie Monument, [[Prince Józef Antoni Poniatowski Monument, Warsaw|Prince Józef  Poniatowski Monument]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus Monument, Warsaw|Nicolaus Copernicus Monument]], [[Stefan Starzyński Monument]], [[Józef Piłsudski Monument, Warsaw|Józef Piłsudski Monument]], [[Janusz Korczak Monument, Warsaw|Janusz Korczak Monument]].<ref name="pomniki"/>

[[File:Palace on the Water, Łazienki Park, Warsaw.jpg|thumb|[[Łazienki Palace]], also referred to as the ''Palace on the Isle'']]

The Saxon Garden, covering an area of 15.5 ha, formally served as a royal garden to the now nonexistent [[Saxon Palace]]. In 1727, it was made into one of the world's first public parks and later remodelled in the forest-like [[English Garden|English style]]. The [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Warsaw|Tomb of the Unknown Soldier]] is situated at the east end of the park near the central fountain, on [[Piłsudski Square]]. With its benches, flower carpets and a central pond, the Krasiński Palace Garden was once a notable strolling destination for most Varsovians. The Łazienki Park covers an area of 76 ha and its unique character and history is reflected in the [[landscape architecture]] (pavilions, sculptures, bridges, water cascades) and vegetation (domestic and foreign species of trees and shrubs). The presence of [[Indian peafowl|peacocks]], [[common pheasant|pheasants]] and squirrels at Łazienki attracts tourists and locals. The Wilanów Palace Parkland on the outskirts of Warsaw traces it history to the second half of the 17th century and covers an area of 43 ha. Its [[Garden à la française|French-styled alleys]] corresponds to the ancient, Baroque forms of the palace.

The flora of Warsaw may be considered very rich in species on city standards. This is mainly due to the location of Warsaw within the border region of several big floral regions comprising substantial proportions of close-to-wilderness areas (natural forests, wetlands along the Vistula) as well as [[arable land]], [[meadow]]s and forests.

In 1939, approximately 1,300,000 people resided in Warsaw;<ref name=Tihran/> by 1945 the population had dropped to 420,000. During the first years after the war, the population growth rate was high and the city soon began to suffer from the lack of flats and dwellings to house new incomers. The first remedial measure was the enlargement of Warsaw's total area (1951)&nbsp;– however the city authorities were still forced to introduce limitations; only the spouses and children of permanent residents as well as some persons of public importance (renowned specialists, artists, engineers) were permitted to stay. This negatively affected the image of an average Warsaw citizen, who was perceived as more privileged than those migrating from rural areas, towns or other cities. While all restrictions on residency registration were scrapped in 1990, the negative opinion of Varsovians in some form continues to this day.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}<!-- DO NOT ADD REFERENCES TO ARTICLES FROM 2008 -->

[[Warsaw metropolitan area]] is an example of the development of a strongly polarized region. The capital, along with its immediate surroundings, concentrates over half of the demographic potential of the [[Masovian Voivodeship]], 2/3 of residents with higher education, and 3/4 of larger economic entities employing more than 50 workers.
Current demographic development trends are as follows:<ref name= "demografia">{{Cite web |url=https://rcin.org.pl/Content/157600/WA51_188627_r2020-t92-z4_Przeg-Geogr-Sleszyns.pdf|title=Prognoza demograficzna dla Warszawy |year=2020 |author1= Przemysław Śleszyński|author2= Łukasz Kubiak|author3= Ewa Korcelli-Olejniczak|access-date=20 January 2024}}</ref>
* a clear increase in the number of residents after the [[1989 Polish parliamentary election|1989 transformations]], from 1.6 to about 2.0 million inhabitants (including unregistered population), mainly due to positive migration balance.
* the highest [[Human migration|migration]] attractiveness in the country for many decades, causing a strong drain of people in the mobile age (18–44 years), including a relatively more frequent influx of women, resulting in high [[feminization]]
* processes of internal deconcentration of population, consisting of centrifugal migration direction (from central districts to external ones, from external districts to [[Suburb|suburban areas]]). Between 1989 and 2017, 213 thousand registered people moved from Warsaw to the suburbs, and in the opposite direction it was only 110 thousand.
* a clear aging of the population: at the end of 2017, people aged 60 and over constituted 27.2% of the registered population, and those aged 70 and over – 13.5%, while for example in 2002, it was respectively 21.5 and 11.5%
In the coming years, an increase in the city's population is predicted, with migration being the main factor determining the state and structure of Warsaw's population, including mainly internal (national) and external (foreign) influx. Changes in the population are not uniform for the entire Warsaw and in the division into districts, the predicted demographic changes will have a varied course. A decrease in population is forecasted in some central districts ([[Praga-Północ]], [[Śródmieście, Warsaw|Śródmieście]]) and an increase in other districts.<ref name= "demografia"/>

As the capital of Poland, Warsaw is the political centre of the country. Almost all central government institutions are located there, including the [[Chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland|Chancellery of the President]], both houses of the [[Parliament of Poland|Polish Parliament]] (the [[lower house]] called [[Sejm]] and the [[upper house]] called [[Senate (Poland)|Senate]]), the [[Chancellery of the Prime Minister of Poland|Chancellery of the Prime Minister]], the [[Constitutional Tribunal (Poland)|Constitutional Tribunal]], the [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]], and the [[Supreme Administrative Court of Poland|Supreme Administrative Court]]. Warsaw is also host to many major international organizations, including [[Frontex]] and the [[Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights]] (the oldest and principal institution of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]]).<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.frontex.europa.eu/media-centre/contact/ |title = Fronex Official Website |access-date = 2024-06-02}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.osce.org/odihr/contacts |title = OSCE Official Website |access-date = 2024-06-02}}</ref>

The city is represented in the parliament by 20 [[Member of Parliament|members of Sejm]] (out of 460) and 4 [[senator]]s (out of 100). In addition, Warsaw together with its metropolitan area elects 6 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] (Members of the European Parliament) out of 705.

The first city mayor of Warsaw was Jan Andrzej Menich (1695–1696).<ref name=Petrozolin/> The municipal self-government existed in Warsaw until World War II and was restored in 1990 (during the communist times, the National City Council&nbsp;– ''Miejska Rada Narodowa''&nbsp;– governed in Warsaw). Since 1990, the structure of city government has been modified several times.<ref name="admin">{{cite web |url=http://e-warsaw.pl/2/index.php?id=568 |title=Administration |work=e-warsaw.pl |access-date=31 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218181549/http://e-warsaw.pl/2/index.php?id=568 |archive-date=18 December 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Between 1975 and 1990 the Warsaw city mayors simultaneously led the [[Warsaw Voivodeship (1975-1998)|Warsaw Voivodeship]]. In the years 1990–1994, the city mayor of Warsaw was elected by the [[city council]].<ref name="djordjevic"/> Subsequently, a controversial reform was introduced, transforming the city in the years of 1994–1999 into a loose municipal union of several gminas, dominated by one of them, the gmina Centrum encompassing the entire inner city. During this period, the mayor of gmina Centrum who was elected by its council was automatically designated as the city mayor of Warsaw, in spite of representing only a fraction of the population of the city. The city was becoming increasingly unmanageable, especially after the administrative reform of Poland in 1999 which further complicated the local government structure of Warsaw. In 2002, the new ''Warsaw Act'' of the Polish parliament restored Warsaw as a single urban gmina with the status of a city with powiat rights, led by a unified local government. At the same time, a significant reform was implemented in all Polish municipal governments, introducing direct elections of the wójt/town mayor/city mayor in all Polish gminas.<ref name="djordjevic"/> The first city mayor of Warsaw elected according to these rules was [[Lech Kaczyński]], who however resigned ahead of term when he was elected [[President of Poland|President of Polish Republic]] in 2005.

Warsaw has thereafter remained an [[urban gmina]] with the status of a [[city with powiat rights]].<ref name="admin"/> [[Legislature|Legislative power]] in Warsaw is vested in a [[unicameralism|unicameral]] [[Warsaw City Council]] (''Rada Miasta''), which comprises 60 members.<ref name="admin"/> Council members are elected directly every five years (since [[2018 Polish local elections|2018 election]]). Like most legislative bodies, the city council divides itself into committees which have the oversight of various functions of the city government.<ref name="admin"/> The city mayor exercises the executive power in the city, being the superior of all unelected municipal- or county-level officials and other employees and supervising all subsidiary entities of the city. The incumbent [[List of city mayors of Warsaw|city mayor of Warsaw]] is [[Rafał Trzaskowski]].

The ''Warsaw Act'' imposes a mandatory division into 18 auxiliary units called ''dzielnica'' (district) on the city. In spite of remaining an integral part of the city as an entity, the districts have a degree of autonomy legally guaranteed through a form of an own local self-government exercising some powers devolved by law from the city. They have the duty to assist the city mayor and the City Council in their tasks, such as supervising some municipal companies, city-owned property or schools. Each of the 18 city districts has an own council (''rada dzielnicy'')<ref name="admin"/> which elects an executive board (''zarząd dzielnicy'') headed by a district mayor (''burmistrz dzielnicy''), the latter elected by the council among several candidates nominated by the city mayor of Warsaw among the council's members.

Following World War II, the authorities decided that the city will be transformed into a major centre for [[heavy industry]] and manufacturing. As a result, numerous large factories and production facilities were built in and around the city. Among the largest were ''Huta Warszawa'' [[steel works]], now [[ArcelorMittal|arcelor]]), the [[Ursus SA]], and the [[Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych]] (FSO) car factory. The now-defunct FSO, established in 1951, was once Warsaw's most successful corporation. Notable vehicles assembled there over the decades include the [[FSO Warszawa]], [[FSO Syrena]], [[Polski Fiat 125p]] and the [[FSO Polonez]]. In 1995, the factory was purchased by the [[South Korea]]n car manufacturer [[Daewoo]], which assembled its models in Warsaw for the European market.

Thanks to numerous musical venues, including the [[Great Theatre, Warsaw|''Teatr Wielki'', the Polish National Opera]], the [[Chamber opera|Chamber Opera]], the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra|National Philharmonic Hall]] and the [[National Theatre, Warsaw|National Theatre]], as well as the Roma and Buffo music theatres and the [[Congress Hall (Warsaw)|Congress Hall]] in the [[Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw|Palace of Culture and Science]], Warsaw hosts many events and festivals. Among the events worth particular attention are: the [[International Frédéric Chopin Piano Competition]], the International Contemporary Music Festival [[Warsaw Autumn]], the Jazz Jamboree, Warsaw Summer Jazz Days, the International [[Stanisław Moniuszko]] Vocal Competition, the Mozart Festival, and the Festival of Old Music.<ref name="salter"/>

Warsaw is also considered one of the European hubs of underground electronic music with a very attractive house and techno music scene.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/03/new-europe-poland-clubs |title=New Europe: Poles dancing |work=The Guardian |date=3 April 2011 |access-date=12 February 2016 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304093844/http://www.theguardian.com/music/2011/apr/03/new-europe-poland-clubs |url-status=live }}</ref>

Warsaw is home to over 30 major theatres spread throughout the city, including the [[National Theatre, Warsaw|National Theatre]] (founded in 1765) and the [[Grand Theatre, Warsaw|Grand Theatre]] (established 1778).<ref name=teatrwielki1/>

[[File:Filharmonia Narodowa wejście główne 2020.jpg|thumb|left|[[Warsaw Philharmonic]] is a venue for the [[International Chopin Piano Competition]]]]

Warsaw also attracts many young and off-stream directors and performers who add to the city's theatrical culture. Their productions may be viewed mostly in smaller theatres and ''Houses of Culture'' (''Domy Kultury''), mostly outside ''[[Śródmieście, Warsaw|Śródmieście]]'' (Central Warsaw). Warsaw hosts the International Theatrical Meetings.

From 1833 to the outbreak of World War II, Plac Teatralny ''([[Theatre Square (Warsaw)|Theatre Square]])'' was the country's cultural hub and home to the various theatres.<ref name="teatrwielki"/> Plac Teatralny and its environs was the venue for numerous parades, celebrations of state holidays, carnival balls and concerts.

The main building housed the [[Great Theatre, Warsaw|Great Theatre]] from 1833 to 1834, the Rozmaitości Theatre from 1836 to 1924 and then the National Theatre, the Reduta Theatre from 1919 to 1924, and from 1928 to 1939{{spaced ndash}}the Nowy Theatre, which staged productions of contemporary poetical drama, including those directed by [[Leon Schiller]].<ref name="teatrwielki"/>

Nearby, in Ogród Saski (the [[Saxon Garden]]), the Summer Theatre was in operation from 1870 to 1939,<ref name=Letni/> and in the [[interwar period|inter-war period]], the theatre complex also included Momus, Warsaw's first literary cabaret, and [[Leon Schiller]]'s musical theatre Melodram. The [[Wojciech Bogusławski]] Theatre (1922–26) was the best example of "Polish monumental theatre". From the mid-1930s, the Great Theatre building housed the Upati Institute of Dramatic Arts{{spaced ndash}}the first state-run academy of dramatic art, with an acting department and a stage directing department.<ref name="teatrwielki"/>

Among the most prestigious ones are the [[National Museum, Warsaw|National Museum]] with a collection of works whose origin ranges in time from antiquity until the present epoch as well as one of the best collections of paintings in the country including some paintings from Adolf Hitler's private collection,<ref name=Schwarz/> and the [[Polish Army Museum|Museum of the Polish Army]] whose set portrays the history of arms.

The collections of [[Łazienki Palace|Łazienki]] and [[Wilanów Palace|Wilanów]] palaces focus on the paintings of the "old masters", as do those of the Royal Castle which displays the [[Palais Lanckoroński#Lanckoroński Collection|Lanckoroński Collection]] including two paintings by Rembrandt.<ref name=Wetering/> The Palace in [[Natolin Palace and Park Complex|Natolin]], a former rural residence of Duke [[Czartoryski family|Czartoryski]], is another venue with its interiors and park accessible to tourists.

The famous [[Copernicus Science Centre]] is an interactive science museum containing over 450 exhibits, enabling visitors to carry out experiments and discover the laws of science for themselves. Warsaw does not have a natural history museum. Yet, it hosts small museums of [[Museum of Evolution of Polish Academy of Sciences|Evolution]] and [[Museum of the Earth of the Polish Academy of Sciences|the Earth]], which play a similar role.

Holding Poland's largest private collection of art, the [[Museum of John Paul II Collection|Carroll Porczyński Collection Museum]]<ref>Official name: ''Museum of John Paul II Collection''</ref> displays works from such varied artists as [[Paris Bordone]], [[Cornelis van Haarlem]], [[José de Ribera]], [[William-Adolphe Bouguereau]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], and [[Vincent van Gogh]]<ref name="muzeummalarstwa" /> along with some copies of masterpieces of European painting.

A fine tribute to the fall of Warsaw and [[history of Poland]] can be found in the [[Warsaw Rising Museum|Warsaw Uprising Museum]] and in the [[Katyń Museum]] which preserves the memory of that crime.<ref name=Baker/> The Warsaw Uprising Museum also operates a rare preserved and operating historic stereoscopic theatre, the [[Warsaw Fotoplastikon]]. The [[Museum of Independence]] preserves patriotic and political objects connected with Poland's struggles for independence. Dating back to 1936 the [[Museum of Warsaw|Warsaw Historical Museum]] contains 60 rooms which host a permanent exhibition of the history of Warsaw from its origins until today.

The 17th century Royal [[Ujazdów Castle]] houses the Centre for Contemporary Art, with some permanent and temporary exhibitions, concerts, shows and creative workshops. The Centre realizes about 500 projects a year. The [[Zachęta]] National Gallery of Art, the oldest exhibition site in Warsaw, with a tradition stretching back to the mid-19th century organises exhibitions of [[modern art]] by Polish and [[International Artists]] and promotes art in many other ways. Since 2011, [[Warsaw Gallery Weekend]] is held on the last weekend of September.

28 September 2023 the opening of the new building of the [[Museum of Polish History]] located at the [[Warsaw Citadel]] took place.

The city also possesses some oddities such as the [[Neon Museum, Warsaw|Neon Museum]], the [[Museum of Caricature, Warsaw|Museum of Caricature]],<ref name=Exhibitions/> the [[Museum of John Paul II and Primate Wyszyński]], the [[Legia Warsaw Museum]], and a Motorisation Museum in [[Otrębusy]].<ref name=motoryzacji/>

In the 20th century, Warsaw was famed for its state-owned [[milk bar]]s (''[[bar mleczny]]'') which offered cheap [[fast food]] in the form of home dinners. Examples of dishes popularized by these canteens include [[tomato soup]], [[schnitzel]]s, [[frikadeller]], [[mizeria|mizeria salad]] and many others. Contemporary fast food giants like [[McDonald's]], [[KFC]], [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] and [[Burger King]] are the successors to milk bars, though some reemerged in recent years due to widespread [[nostalgia]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://wawalove.wp.pl/wraca-moda-na-bary-mleczne-reaktywacja-baru-gdanskiego-6178764019673217a |title=Wraca moda na bary mleczne.

The mermaid (''syrenka'') is Warsaw's symbol<ref name=ucl/> and can be found on statues throughout the city and on [[Coat of arms of Warsaw|the city's coat of arms]]. This imagery has been in use since at least the mid-14th century.<ref name=Mermaid/> The oldest existing armed seal of Warsaw is from the year 1390, consisting of a round seal bordered with the Latin inscription ''Sigilium Civitatis Varsoviensis'' (Seal of the city of Warsaw).<ref name="herb"/> City records as far back as 1609 document the use of a crude form of a [[sea monster]] with a female upper body and holding a sword in its claws.<ref name=Bratosiewicz/> In 1653 the poet Zygmunt Laukowski asks the question:

[[File:Syrenka Warszawska.jpg|thumb|upright|left|1855 bronze sculpture of ''The Warsaw Mermaid'' in the [[Old Town Market Place, Warsaw|Old Town Market Place]]]]

The Mermaid Statue stands in the very centre of Old Town Square, surrounded by a fountain. Due to vandalism, the original statue had been moved to the grounds of the Museum of Warsaw – the statue in the square is a copy.
This is not the only mermaid in Warsaw. Another is located on the bank of the Vistula River near Świętokrzyski Bridge and another on Karowa Street.

The origin of the legendary figure is not fully known. The best-known legend, by Artur Oppman, is that long ago two of [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]]'s daughters set out on a journey through the depths of the oceans and seas. One of them decided to stay on the coast of Denmark and can be seen sitting at the entrance to the port of [[Copenhagen]]. The second mermaid reached the mouth of the [[Vistula]] River and plunged into its waters. She stopped to rest on a sandy beach by the village of Warszowa, where fishermen came to admire her beauty and listen to her beautiful voice. A greedy merchant also heard her songs; he followed the fishermen and captured the mermaid.<ref name="legend"/>

Another legend says that a mermaid once swam to Warsaw from the [[Baltic Sea]] for the love of the Griffin, the ancient defender of the city, who was killed in a struggle against the [[Deluge (history)|Swedish invasions]] of the 17th century. The mermaid, wishing to avenge his death, took the position of defender of Warsaw, becoming the symbol of the city.<ref name="legend"/>

The best of the city's swimming centres is at Wodny Park Warszawianka, {{convert|4|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the centre at Merliniego Street, where there's an Olympic-sized pool as well as water slides and children's areas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wodnypark.com.pl/index.php?lang=en |title=Wodny Park |work=wodnypark.com.pl |access-date=31 January 2009 |archive-date=28 April 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428142436/http://www.wodnypark.com.pl/index.php?lang=en |url-status=live }}</ref>

From the Warsovian football teams, the most famous is [[Legia Warsaw]]&nbsp;– the army club with a nationwide following play at the [[Polish Army Stadium]], just southeast of the centre at [[Łazienkowska Street]]. Established in 1916, they have won the [[Ekstraklasa|country's championship]] fifteen times (most recently in 2021) and won the [[Polish Cup]] nineteen times. In the [[1995–96 UEFA Champions League]] season, they reached the quarter-finals, where they lost to Greek club [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]].

Their local rivals, [[Polonia Warsaw]], have significantly fewer supporters, yet they managed to win the country's championship two times (in 1946 and 2000) and won the cup twice as well. Polonia's home venue is located at Konwiktorska Street, a ten-minute walk north from the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]]. Polonia was relegated from the country's top flight in 2013 because of their disastrous financial situation. They are now playing in the first league (2nd tier in Poland).

[[Legia Warszawa (basketball)|Legia Warsaw's basketball team]] was one of the country's best teams in 50s and 60s. They are now participating in [[Polish Basketball League|PLK]], the highest-tier level of the Polish basketball.
