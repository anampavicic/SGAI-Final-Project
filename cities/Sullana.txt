==Population==
Migration to Sullana has been intensive, but "pueblos jóvenes" ([[shanty town]]s) are neither widespread nor conspicuous, as they are in Piura for example. The population in Sullana was 112,770 in 1981, 147,361 in 1993 and c. 162,500 in 2005.

==History==
The Chira valley has always been an important farming area. Before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish Invasion]], ethnic groups like the [[Tallanes]], the [[Moche (culture)|Mochicas]], the [[Chimú]], and finally the [[Incas]] had settled here. This region was chosen by the Spaniards to found their first city in this part of the Americas, San Miguel de Tangarara, on July 15, 1532. The Spaniards changed the native farming system and created [[Repartimiento]]s and [[Encomienda]]s.

Sullana was founded late in the 18th century, on July 8, 1783, by Bishop Baltazar Jaime Martínez de Compañon y Bufanda and given the name of "El Principe" (The Prince).

== Transportation ==
Sullana has good bus connections to the north, to [[Piura]] in the south, as well as inland to [[Ayabaca]] and to [[La Tina]] on the [[Ecuador]]ian border. The [[Calle canal|Canal Vía]] runs across the city.

The [[Tren de la Costa (Peru)|Tren de la Costa]] is planned.

== Tourism ==
In the first week of January the Feria Internacional de los Reyes is celebrated. 
The [[Poechos Reservoir]], 27&nbsp;km from the city, offers water sports like water skiing, motor-boating, fishing and swimming.
