==Etymology==
An unverified theory is that the former name of the city, ''Hisn-Mansur'' derives from the name of the [[Umayyad]] Emir Mansur ibn Jawana who was killed by the [[Abbasid]] [[Caliph]] [[Al-Mansur]] in this region in 758.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Sinclair|first=Thomas T.|title=Adıyaman|url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/adyaman-SIM_0303?s.num=435&s.rows=100&s.start=380|journal=Encyclopedia of Islam, Third Edition|date=July 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Taeschner|first=Franz|date=24 April 2012|title=Adiyaman|url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/adiyaman-SIM_0316|journal=Encyclopedia of Islam, Second Edition}}</ref> Because of the difficulty among the locals in pronouncing ''Hisn-Mansur,'' the corruption ''Semsur'' emerged.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Han|first=Suna|date=2001|title=Adıyaman Tarihi ve Kültürü|url=http://docs.neu.edu.tr/library/6294007862.pdf|journal=Near East University Science Literature Faculty|location=[[Nicosia]]|publisher=[[Near East University]]|page=1|access-date=2021-04-20|archive-date=2021-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210420104321/http://docs.neu.edu.tr/library/6294007862.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
The first settlement on the site of the city was the ancient town of [[Perrhe]], part of the [[kingdom of Commagene]] before it became part of the Roman and later [[Byzantine Empire]]. 

It was then captured by the Arabs and became known as '''Hisn Mansur'''. It became a contested border town between the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliphate]] and the Byzantines and was therefore well protected; a wall with three gates and a ditch guarded the town while in its middle stood a fortress with double walls.{{sfn|Strange|2010|p=123}}

In the early eleventh century, the town formed part of the Byzantine defences in the Euphrates region together with [[Edessa]], [[Gerger|Gargar]], [[Samsat|Samosata]] and [[Siverek|Chasanara]].{{sfn|Beihammer|2017|p=115}} In 1066/1067, the region around the town was ravaged by a Turkish emir called Gümüshtekīn who took booty and captives.{{sfn|Beihammer|2017|p=116}}

By the end of the eleventh century, the Byzantines had lost control of the town and it was now in possession of the Armenian local ruler [[Kogh Vasil]].{{sfn|Beihammer|2017|p=294}}
