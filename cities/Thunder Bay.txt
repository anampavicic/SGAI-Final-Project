'''Thunder Bay''' is a city in and the seat of [[Thunder Bay District]], Ontario, Canada. It is the most populous municipality in [[Northwestern Ontario]] and the second most populous (after [[Greater Sudbury]]) municipality in [[Northern Ontario]]. Its population is 108,843 according to the [[2021 Canadian census]]. 
Located on [[Lake Superior]], the [[census metropolitan area]] of Thunder Bay has a population of 123,258 and consists of the city of Thunder Bay, the municipalities of [[Oliver Paipoonge]] and [[Neebing, Ontario|Neebing]], the townships of [[Shuniah]], [[Conmee, Ontario|Conmee]], [[O'Connor, Ontario|O'Connor]], and [[Gillies, Ontario|Gillies]], and the [[Fort William First Nation]].

European settlement in the region began in the late 17th century with a French [[fur trading]] outpost on the banks of the [[Kaministiquia River]].<ref name="TBHistory">[https://web.archive.org/web/20071022160858/http://www.thunderbay.ca/index.cfm?fuse=html&pg=313 Brief History of Thunder Bay], City of Thunder Bay. Retrieved 5 June 2007.</ref> It grew into an important transportation hub with its port forming an important link in the shipping of [[grain]] and other products from [[western Canada]], through the [[Great Lakes]] and the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]], to the east coast. [[Forestry]] and [[manufacturing]] played important roles in the city's economy. They have declined in recent years, but have been replaced by a "[[knowledge economy]]" based on [[medical research]] and education. Thunder Bay is the site of the Thunder Bay Regional Health Research Institute.

On 1 January 1970, the City of Thunder Bay was formed through the merger of the cities of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]], [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]], and the geographic townships of Neebing and McIntyre. The city takes this name from the immense [[Thunder Bay (Ontario landform)|Thunder Bay]] at the head of Lake Superior, known on 18th-century French maps as {{Lang|fr|Baie du Tonnerre}} (Bay of Thunder).<ref name="TBHistory"/> The city is often referred to as the "Lakehead", or "Canadian Lakehead", because of its location at the end of Great Lakes navigation on the Canadian side of the border.<ref name="Lakehead">Tronrud, Thorold J; Epp, Ernest A.; and others. (1995).

==History==
{{Main|Port Arthur, Ontario|Fort William, Ontario}}

===Before 1900===
Various [[Anishinaabe]] peoples such as the [[Ojibwa]] are indigenous to the Thunder Bay Area.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.thunderbay.ca/en/city-hall/history-of-thunder-bay.aspx | title=History of Thunder Bay | date=17 February 2022 }}</ref> European settlement at Thunder Bay began with two French fur trading posts (in 1683 and 1717) which were subsequently abandoned (see [[Fort William, Ontario]]). In 1803, the Montreal-based [[North West Company]] established Fort William as its mid-continent ''[[entrepôt]]''.

[[File:Fort William 1865.jpg|thumbnail|left|Fort William in 1865]]
By the 1850s, the [[Province of Canada]] began to take an interest in its western extremity. The discovery of [[copper]] in the [[Keweenaw Peninsula]] of Michigan had prompted a national interest in potential [[mining]] locations on the Canadian shores of Lake Superior. In 1849, French-speaking [[Jesuits]] established the {{Lang|fr|Mission de l'Immaculée-Conception}} (Mission of the Immaculate Conception) on the [[Kaministiquia River|Kaministiquia]] to [[Evangelism|evangelize]] the [[Ojibwe]]. The Province of Canada negotiated the [[Robinson Treaty]] in 1850 with the Ojibwa of Lake Superior. As a result, an Indian reserve was set aside for them south of the Kaministiquia River.

Another settlement developed a few miles to the north of Fort William after construction by the federal Department of Public Works of a road connecting Lake Superior with the [[Red River Colony]]. The work was directed by [[Simon James Dawson]] (see [[Port Arthur, Ontario]]). This public works depot or construction headquarters acquired its first name in May 1870 when Colonel [[Garnet Wolseley]] named it Prince Arthur's Landing. It was renamed Port Arthur by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) in May 1883.<ref>F.B. Scollie, "Falling into Line : How Prince Arthur's Landing Became Port Arthur", Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society ''Papers and Records'', XIII (1985) 8–19.</ref>

The arrival of the CPR  sparked a long rivalry between the towns, which did not end until their amalgamation in 1970. Until the 1880s, Port Arthur was a much larger community. The CPR, in collaboration with the Hudson's Bay Company, preferred east Fort William, located on the lower Kaministiquia River where the fur trade posts were. Provoked by a prolonged tax dispute with Port Arthur and its seizure of a [[locomotive]] in 1889, the CPR relocated all its employees and facilities to Fort William. The collapse of [[silver mining]] after 1890 undermined the economy of Port Arthur. It had an economic depression, while Fort William thrived.

===20th century===
[[File:T-bay Railway Station.jpg|thumb|CN Railway Station]]
In the era of [[Wilfrid Laurier|Sir Wilfrid Laurier]], Thunder Bay began a period of extraordinary growth, based on improved access to markets via the [[transcontinental railway]] and development of the western [[wheat]] boom. The CPR double-tracked its Winnipeg–Thunder Bay line. The [[Canadian Northern Railway]] established facilities at Port Arthur. The [[Grand Trunk Pacific Railway]] began construction of its facilities at the Fort William Mission in 1905, and the federal government began construction of the [[National Transcontinental Railway]]. [[Grain elevator]] construction boomed as the volume of grain shipped to Europe increased. Both cities incurred debt to grant bonuses to manufacturing industries.

Thunder Bay was the first city in the world to enact daylight saving time, on 1 July 1908.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.northernontario.travel/thunder-bay/the-thunder-bay-connection-to-daylight-savings-time|title=Time to change your clocks – but why?|date=8 March 2018|work=Northern Ontario Travel|access-date=9 October 2018}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://www.timeanddate.com/time/dst/ |title=Daylight Saving Time |access-date=8 October 2018 }}</ref>

By 1914, the twin cities had modern infrastructures (sewers, potable water supply, street lighting, electric light, etc.) Both Fort William and Port Arthur were proponents of municipal ownership. As early as 1892, Port Arthur built Canada's first municipally-owned electric street railway. Both cities spurned [[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone Company of Canada]] to establish their municipally-owned telephone systems in 1902.

The boom came to an end in 1913–1914, aggravated by the outbreak of the First World War. A wartime economy emerged with the making of munitions and shipbuilding. Men from the cities joined the 52nd, 94th, and 141st Battalions of the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]].

Railway employment was hurt when the federal government took over the [[National Transcontinental Railway]] and Lake Superior Division from the Grand Trunk in 1915, and the Canadian Northern Railway in 1918. These were amalgamated with other government-owned railways in 1923 to form the [[Canadian National Railways]]. The CNR closed many of the Canadian Northern Railway facilities in Port Arthur. It opened the Neebing yards in Neebing Township in 1922. By 1929, the population of the two cities had recovered to pre-war levels.

The [[Forest product|forest products industry]] has played an important role in the Thunder Bay economy since the 1870s. In the 1880s, [[Herman Finger]] established the [[Pigeon River Lumber Company]] in the area, and also built the [[Gunflint and Lake Superior Railroad]], but he dissolved the lumber company and moved his operations to The Pas by 1919.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/chc/hrb/internal_reports/pdfs/Lumber_Industry_Mb_Nicholson.pdf|title=The Lumber Industry in Manitoba|last=Nicholson|first=Karen|date=February 2000|website=Manitoba Culture, Heritage, Tourism and Sport – Historic Resources Branch|access-date=26 October 2019}}</ref> Logs and lumber were shipped primarily to the United States. In 1917, the first pulp and paper mill was established in Port Arthur. It was followed by a mill at Fort William, in 1920. Eventually, four mills were operating.

Manufacturing resumed in 1937 when the Canada Car and Foundry Company plant (opened for the manufacture of naval ships and railcars during the late World War I) re-opened to build British aircraft. Now run by [[Alstom]], the plant has remained a mainstay of the post-war economy. It has produced forestry equipment and transportation equipment for urban transit systems, such as the [[Toronto Transit Commission]] and [[GO Transit]].

===Amalgamation===
On 1 January 1970, the City of Thunder Bay was formed through the merger of the cities of [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]], [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]], and the geographic townships of Neebing and McIntyre.<ref name="TBHistory"/> Its name was the result of a [[referendum]] held previously on 23 June 1969, to determine the new name of the amalgamated Fort William and Port Arthur. Officials debated over the names to be put on the ballot, taking suggestions from residents including "Lakehead" and "The Lakehead". Because [[Vote splitting|the vote split between the two similar names]], "Thunder Bay" prevailed with a narrow [[plurality voting|plurality]]. The final tally was "Thunder Bay" with 15,870, "Lakehead" with 15,302, and "The Lakehead" with 8,377.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20070809121412/http://www.thunderbay.ca/docs/business/1012.pdf About Thunder Bay], pp. 2. Retrieved 2 September 2007.</ref>

There was more controversy over the selection of a name for the amalgamated city than over whether to amalgamate. A vocal minority of the population preferred "The Lakehead".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thunderbay.ca/Assets/CEDC/docs/Thunder_Bay_Overview+-+opens+a+new+window.pdf |title=The City of Thunder Bay |access-date=5 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100254/http://www.thunderbay.ca/Assets/CEDC/docs/Thunder_Bay_Overview+-+opens+a+new+window.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> There was much discussion about other cities in the world that use a [[definite article]] in their names. The area was often referred to as "The Lakehead" before and after amalgamation based on its geographic location. It was seen as the "head" of shipping on the Great Lakes and the "rail head".

The expansion of highways, beginning with the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] and culminating with the opening of [[Ontario Highway 17|Highway 17]] (linking Sault Ste Marie to Thunder Bay in 1960), has significantly diminished railway and shipping activity since the 1970s and 80s. Shipping on the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]] was superseded by trucking on highways. Grain shipping on the Great Lakes to the East has declined substantially in favour of transport to Pacific Coast ports. As a result, many grain elevators have been closed and demolished. The Kaministiquia River was abandoned by industry and shipping.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Canada|first=Geological Survey of|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=54EOAQAAIAAJ&q=The+Kaministiquia+River+was+abandoned|title=Annual Report|date=1899|publisher=The Survey}}</ref>

===Today===
Thunder Bay has become the regional services centre for [[Northwestern Ontario]] with most provincial departments represented. [[Lakehead University]], established through the lobbying of local businesspeople and professionals, has proven to be a major asset. Another post-secondary institution is [[Confederation College]].

In the 2010s, the Marina Park was developed as a tourist destination.<ref>{{Cite news |date=18 January 2013 |title=Thunder Bay's revitalized waterfront: A declaration that aboriginal culture matters |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/arts/art-and-architecture/thunder-bays-revitalized-waterfront-a-declaration-that-aboriginal-culture-matters/article7516689/ |access-date=25 January 2024}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Thunder Bay NASA.jpg|thumb|Fort William as seen from the [[International Space Station]], December 2008]]
[[File:ISS053-E-223431.jpg|thumb|Thunder Bay is the brightly lit city along the top of Lake Superior, taken at 1:58 AM on 10 November 2017, during ISS [[Expedition 53]].]]

The city has an area of {{convert|328.48|km2|mi2}}, which includes the former cities of Fort William and Port Arthur, as well as the former townships of Neebing and McIntyre. The city reflects the settlement patterns of the 19th century and sprawls. Anchoring the west end of the city, the Fort William Town Plot, surveyed in 1859–60, was named West Fort William (or Westfort) in 1888 by the CPR. The land adjoining the lower Kaministiquia River became the residential and central business district of the town and city of Fort William. A large uninhabited area adjoining the Neebing and McIntyre rivers, which became known as Intercity, separated Fort William from the residential and central business district of Port Arthur. At the extreme east of the city, a part of McIntyre Township was annexed to the town of Port Arthur in 1892, forming what later became known as the Current River area.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The former Port Arthur section is more typical of the [[Canadian Shield]], with gently sloping hills and very thin soil lying on top of bedrock with many bare outcrops. [[Thunder Bay (Ontario landform)|Thunder Bay]], which gives the city its name, is about {{convert|22.5|km|mi}} from the Port Arthur downtown to Thunder Cape at the tip of the [[Sleeping Giant (Ontario)|Sleeping Giant]]. The former Fort William section occupies flat [[alluvial]] land along the Kaministiquia River. In the [[river delta]] are two large islands: Mission Island and McKellar Island. Since 1970, the central business districts of Fort William and Port Arthur have suffered a serious decline.  Business and government relocated to new developments in the Intercity area. There has also been substantial residential growth in adjacent areas of the former Neebing and McIntyre townships.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Neighbourhoods===
[[File:View Of Thunder Bay Harbour.jpg|thumb|The Port of Thunder Bay, as seen from Hillcrest Park in June 2006|222x222px]]
Thunder Bay is composed of two formerly separate cities: [[Port Arthur, Ontario|Port Arthur]] and [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]]. Both still retain much of their distinct civic identities, reinforced by the buffering effect of the Intercity area between them. Port Arthur and Fort William each have their own [[central business district]]s and suburban areas.  Neighbourhoods include: [[Downtown Fort William, Ontario|Downtown Fort William]] and [[Current River, Thunder Bay, Ontario|Current River]] among others.

Lack of innovation by traditional industries, such as forest products, combined with high labour costs have reduced the industrial base of Thunder Bay by close to 60%. The [[grain trade]] has declined because of the loss of [[Crow Rate|grain transportation subsidies]] and the loss of European markets. The gradual transition from shipping by train and boat to shipping by truck, and the [[Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement]] have ended Thunder Bay's privileged position as a linchpin in Canadian east–west freight-handling trade. As a result, the city has lost its traditional [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] as a [[Break bulk cargo|break-bulk point]]. However, in recent years shipments through the port of Thunder Bay have stabilized, and it remains an important part of the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]].<ref>''[https://archive.today/20120910133724/http://www.portofthunderbay.com/article/56year-cargo-statistics-179.asp 56-Year Cargo Statistics], Port of Thunder Bay''.

[[File:Thunder Bay ward map.svg|thumb|right|Map of Thunder Bay's seven municipal wards]]

Currently, the city is studying a possibilities in reducing the size of city council from 13 to a smaller number. These changes, if successful, would be implemented from the 2026 Municipal election. In September 2024, two ideas were presented: <ref>{{Cite web |date=5 September 2024 |title=Thunder Bay council composition committee readies proposals |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/thunder-bay/council-composition-update-1.7312253 |access-date=8 September 2024 |website=CBC News}}</ref>

* '''No wards:''' All wards will be abolished, eliminating the positions of all ward councillors effective the 2026 election. Five new councillor at large positions will be created for a grand total of 10 councillors at large. This system allows all members of city council to be elected by all citizens of Thunder Bay, regardless of where they live.
* '''4 wards:''' There would be four wards instead of seven. These new wards would be designed by splitting the city along east-west corridors. Instead of names like current wards, they would have numbers 1-4, with 1 being the northernmost and 4 being the southernmost. Wards 1 and 2 would be split by [[Ontario Highway 102|Dawson Road]], Red River Road, Junot Avenue, and River Street. Wards 2 and 3 would be split by Oliver Road while wards 3 and 4 would be split by Arthur Street. Each ward would have 2 councillors instead of 1, resulting in 8 ward councillors. The number of councillors at large would be reduced from 5 to 2, resulting in 10 city councillors.

===City symbols===
;[[Sleeping Giant (Ontario)|Sleeping Giant]]
A large formation of [[mesa]]s on the [[Sibley Peninsula]] in [[Lake Superior]] which resembles a reclining giant has become a symbol of the city.
