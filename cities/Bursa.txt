'''Bursa''' ({{IPA|tr|ˈbuɾsa}}) is a city in northwestern [[Turkey]] and the administrative center of [[Bursa Province]]. The [[list of cities in Turkey|fourth-most populous]] city in Turkey and [[List of largest cities and towns in Turkey|second-most populous]] in the [[Marmara Region]], Bursa is one of the industrial centers of the country. Most of [[automotive industry in Turkey|Turkey's automotive production]] takes place in Bursa. As of 2019, the Metropolitan Province was home to 3,056,120 inhabitants, 2,161,990 of whom lived in the 3 city urban districts ([[Osmangazi]], [[Yıldırım, Bursa|Yıldırım]] and [[Nilüfer, Bursa|Nilüfer]]) plus [[Gürsu]] and [[Kestel, Bursa|Kestel]].<ref name="citypopulation.de">{{Cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/turkey/admin/TR411__bursa/|title = Bursa (Metropolitan Province, Turkey) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location}}</ref>

Bursa was the first major and second overall capital of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman State]] between 1335 and 1363. A more recent nickname is {{lang|tr|Yeşil Bursa}} ("{{lang|en|Green Bursa}}") referring to the parks and gardens located across the city, as well as to the vast, varied forests of the surrounding region.

Bursa has a rather orderly urban growth and borders a fertile plain. The [[mausoleums]] of the early [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottoman sultans]] are located in Bursa, and the city's main landmarks include numerous edifices built throughout the Ottoman period. Bursa also has [[thermal bath]]s, old Ottoman mansions, palaces, and several museums. [[Uludağ|Mount Uludağ]], known in [[classical antiquity]] as the [[Mysian Olympus]] or alternatively [[Bithynian Olympus]], towers over the city, and has a well-known [[ski resort]]. 

The [[shadow play]] characters [[Karagöz and Hacivat]] are based on historic personalities who lived and died in Bursa in the 14th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.karagoz.org.tr/tr/karagoz-blog/karagoz-tarihcesi|title = Karagöz'ün Tarihçesi}}</ref>

[[File:Archaeological Museum 6978.jpg|195px|thumb|left|[[Athena]], bronze, 2nd century AD, at [[Bursa Archaeological Museum]]]]
The earliest known human settlement near Bursa's current location was at Ilıpınar Höyüğü around 5200 BC.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Ilıpınar Excavations I|last = Roodenberg|first = J. J.|publisher = Nederlands Historisch-Archaeologisch Institut in het Nabije Oosten te Istanbul|year = 1995|isbn = 9062580734|location = the University of Michigan}}</ref> It was followed by the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] city of [[Cius]], which [[Philip V of Macedon]] granted to [[Prusias I of Bithynia|Prusias I]], the King of [[Bithynia]], in 202 BC. King Prusias rebuilt the city with the advice of general [[Hannibal of Carthage]], who took refuge with Prusias after losing the war with the [[Roman Republic]] and renamed it '''Prusa''' ({{langx|grc|Προῦσα}}; sometimes rendered as ''Prussa''). After 128 years of Bithynian rule, [[Nicomedes IV of Bithynia|Nicomedes IV]], the last King of [[Bithynia]], bequeathed the entire kingdom to the [[Roman Empire]] in 74 BC. An early [[Bursa Treasure|Roman Treasure]] was found near Bursa in the early 20th century. Composed of a woman's silver toilet articles, it is now in the [[British Museum]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?searchText=Bursa,+tomb|title=British Museum - Collection search: You searched for Bursa, tomb|work=British Museum|access-date=25 May 2015}}</ref>

Under Byzantine rule, the town became a garrison city in 562, where imperial guards were stationed. Already by the mid-6th century, Bursa was known as a famous silk textile manufacturing centre.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last1=Dumper |first1=Michael |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3SapTk5iGDkC |title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa |last2=Stanley |first2=Bruce E. |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2007 |pages=101 |isbn=9781576079195 |language=en}}</ref>

Bursa (from the Greek "Prusa") became the first major capital city of the early [[Ottoman Empire]] following its capture from the [[Byzantine]]s in 1326. As a result, the city witnessed a considerable amount of urban growth such as the building of hospitals, [[caravanserai]]s and [[madrasa]]s throughout the 14th century, with the first official Ottoman mint established in the city.<ref name=":0" /> After conquering [[Edirne]] (Adrianople) in [[East Thrace]], the Ottomans turned it into the new capital city in 1363, but Bursa retained its spiritual and commercial importance in the Ottoman Empire.<ref>"In 1363 the Ottoman capital moved from Bursa to Edirne, although Bursa retained its spiritual and economic importance."

During the Ottoman period, Bursa continued to be the source of most royal [[silk]] products. Aside from the local silk production, the city imported raw silk from [[Iran]], and occasionally from [[China]], and was the main production centre for the [[kaftan]]s, pillows, [[embroidery]] and other silk products for the Ottoman palaces until the 17th century.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Chen |first=Yuan Julian |date=2021-10-11 |title=Between the Islamic and Chinese Universal Empires: The Ottoman Empire, Ming Dynasty, and Global Age of Explorations |url=https://www.academia.edu/59068575 |journal=Journal of Early Modern History |volume=25 |issue=5 |pages=422–456 |doi=10.1163/15700658-bja10030 |s2cid=244587800 |issn=1385-3783}}</ref> Devshirme system was also implemented in Bursa and its surroundings where it was negotiated between the authorities and locals. For example, during the 1603-4 levy, the villagers of a Christian village called [[Eğerce, Mudanya|Eğerciler]], in Bursa, declared that they were responsible for providing sheep to the capital, and the children of the village were very much needed as shepherds. They asserted that even though they were not obliged to give any children to the army, the officers took some anyway, and that they should be returned. The villagers’ claim that it was in tremendous need of future shepherds was taken seriously by the state, and a decree commanded the return of the children.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Yılmaz |first=Gülay |date=2015-12-01 |title=The Devshirme System and the Levied Children of Bursa in 1603-4 |url=https://belleten.gov.tr/doi/10.37879/belleten.2015.901 |journal=Belleten |language=tr |volume=79 |issue=286 |pages=901–930 |doi=10.37879/belleten.2015.901 |issn=0041-4255}}</ref> Bursa was also notable for its numerous [[hammam]]s (bath) built during the reign of [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] such as the Yeni Kaplıca.<ref name=":0" /> From 1867 until 1922, Bursa was the capital of [[Hüdavendigâr vilayet]].

In July 1915, thousands of Greek Orthodox Christians sought refuge in Bursa after having been forced out of their coastal villages by orders of the [[Young Turks|Young Turk government]]. This worsened the situation of the native Greeks of Bursa, who had managed to survive through the attacks and boycotts of 1914. A short time later, deportation orders came for Bursa's Armenians. Protestant Armenians were initially spared from deportation, but villagers that tried to resist were massacred. Most of the deportees would perish in what became known as the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Subsequently, large numbers of Kurds and Circassians, as well as Syrians from the south, were settled in the homes and towns of the deported Christians, radically altering the demographic composition of the town and region.<ref name="Gingeras2016">{{cite book | author = Ryan Gingeras | date = 2016 | title = Fall of the Sultanate: The Great War and the End of the Ottoman Empire, 1908-1922 | publisher = Oxford University Press | pages = 171– | isbn = 978-0-19-967607-1 | oclc = 1026510365 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=AYiMCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA171}}</ref> According to Mustafa Zahit Oner, in the last days of the [[Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922)|Greco-Turkish War]] in 1922, the Greek Army attempted to burn the center of Bursa however they were stopped by the allied commanders and were only able to burn the train station together with Turkish civilians in it.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1236894121 |title=Anadolu'da Yunan Zulüm ve Vahşeti |publisher=DBY Yayınları |others=Mustafa Zahit Öner |year=2021 |isbn=978-625-7760-27-0 |edition= |location=İstanbul, Türkiye |pages=265–267 |language=tr |oclc=1236894121}}</ref> The Cretan artilleryman Vasilios Moustakis describes the event with the following words: "The Infantry had come through and set fire to the station.

Following the foundation of the [[Republic of Turkey]] in 1923, Bursa became one of the industrial centres of the country. The economic development of the city was followed by population growth, and Bursa became the [[Cities in Turkey|4th]] most populous city in [[Turkey]].

The city has traditionally been a pole of attraction, and was a major centre for refugees from various ethnic backgrounds who immigrated to [[Anatolia]] from the [[Balkans]] during the loss of the [[Ottoman territories in Europe]] between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The most recent arrival of [[Turks in Europe#Balkan Turks|Balkan Turks]] took place between the 1940s and 1990s, when the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] expelled approximately 150,000 [[Bulgarian Turks in Turkey|Bulgarian Turks]] to Turkey.<ref>Eminov, Ali, ''Turks and Other Muslim Minorities in Bulgaria'', New York, Routledge, 1997, Höpken, W., "Modernisierung und Nationalismus: Sozialgeschichtliche Aspekte der bulgarischen Minderheitenpolitik gegenüber den Türken" in: SOE 7-8 (1986), Schönfeld, R., ed, ''Nationalitätenprobleme in Südosteuropa'', Munich, Oldenbourg, 1997, p. 255-303, Erdinç, Didar, "Bulgaristan'daki Değişim Sürecinde Türk Azınlığın Ekonomik Durumu", ''Türkler'', Ankara, 2002, s.394–400.</ref> About one-third of these 150,000 Bulgarian Turkish refugees eventually settled in Bursa (especially in the Hürriyet neighbourhood). With the construction of new industrial zones in the period between 1980 and 2000, many people from the [[Eastern Anatolia Region|eastern provinces of Turkey]] came and settled in Bursa.

Traditionally, Bursa was famous for being the largest centre of [[silk]] trade in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and later the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires, during the period of the lucrative [[Silk Road]]. The city is still a major centre for textiles in Turkey and is home to the Bursa International Textiles and Trade Centre ({{lang|tr|Bursa Uluslararası Tekstil ve Ticaret Merkezi}}, or {{lang|tr|BUTTIM}}). Bursa was also known for its fertile soil and agricultural activities, which have decreased in the recent decades due to the heavy industrialization of the city.

Bursa is a major centre for tourism. One of the most popular [[skiing]] resorts in Turkey is located on [[Uludağ|Mount Uludağ]], just next to the city proper. Bursa's thermal baths have been used for therapeutical purposes since [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times. Apart from the baths that are operated by hotels, [[Uludağ University]] has a [[physical therapy]] centre which also makes use of thermal water.

Bursa has two public universities and one private university. [[Uludağ University]], founded in 1975, is the oldest institution of higher education in the city. Founded first as the Bursa University then renamed Uludağ University in 1982,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uludag.edu.tr/konu/view/15|title=Uludağ Üniversitesi Hakkında|website=Uludağ Üniversitesi Resmi Websitesi}}</ref> the university has a student body of 47,000, one of the largest in Turkey.

== Sports ==
[[File:Bursa Büyükşehir Belediye Stadium 20181026 (2).jpg|thumb|[[Timsah Arena]] is the home of Bursaspor, which won the [[Süper Lig]] (Super League) championship title at the end of the [[2009–10 Süper Lig|2009–10 season]].]]

The city has one professional football club, [[Bursaspor]], which formerly competed in the [[Süper Lig]] (Super League), the top-tier of Turkish football, until [[2018–19 Süper Lig#League table|finishing 16th]] at the end of the [[2018–19 Süper Lig]] season and being relegated to the [[TFF First League]]. A few years earlier, Bursaspor had managed to become the [[List of Turkish football champions#Performance since 1957|Turkish champions]] at the end of the [[2009–10 Süper Lig]] season, thereby becoming the second Anatolian club to ever win the Süper Lig championship title after Trabzonspor. Henceforth, Bursaspor was often considered to be one of the five biggest football clubs in Turkey, along with [[Galatasaray]], Fenerbahçe, Beşiktaş and Trabzonspor. The club's relegation to the TFF First League at the end of the 2018–19 season was a major shock for its fans and became a first in the history of Turkish football. Never had a club which had won the Süper Lig championship title been relegated.

Bursaspor plays its home games at the [[Timsah Arena]] (meaning "Crocodile Arena", [[crocodile]] being the mascot of the team), which has a seating capacity of 45,000.

The city has three professional [[basketball]] teams in the [[Turkish Basketball League]], Bursaspor and [[Tofaş S.K.]], which is among the most successful teams. The club plays its games at the [[Tofaş Nilüfer Spor Salonu|Tofaş Nilüfer Sports Hall]]. Also, [[Final Spor]] plays in the second division.

== Main sights ==
===Ulu Cami (Grand Mosque)===
[[File:Ulucami-bursa - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Grand Mosque of Bursa|Grand Mosque]] and Orhan Gazi Square in Bursa]]

[[Bursa Grand Mosque|Ulu Cami]] is the largest mosque in Bursa and a landmark of early [[Ottoman architecture]], which incorporated many elements from [[Anatolian Seljuk Sultanate|Seljuk]] architecture.

Ordered by Sultan [[Bayezid I]], the mosque was designed and built by architect Ali Neccar in 1396–1400. It is a large and rectangular building, with a total of twenty domes that are arranged in four rows of five, and are supported by 12 columns. Supposedly the twenty domes were built instead of the twenty separate mosques which Sultan [[Bayezid I]] had promised for winning the [[Battle of Nicopolis]] in 1396. The mosque has two [[minaret]]s.

[[File:Bursa_Atatürk_Müzesi.JPG|thumb|[[Bursa Atatürk Museum]]]]

Inside the mosque, there are 192 monumental wall inscriptions written by the famous [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphers]] of that period. There is also a fountain ([[şadırvan]]) where worshipers can perform [[Wudu|ritual ablutions]] before prayer; the dome over the şadırvan is capped by a skylight which creates a soft, serene light below; thus playing an important role in the illumination of the large building.

[[File:Bursa_Yeşil_Camii_-_Green_Mosque_(25).jpg|thumb|[[Yeşil Mosque]]]]

The horizontally spacious and dimly lit interior is designed to feel peaceful and contemplative. The subdivisions of space formed by multiple domes and pillars create a sense of privacy and even intimacy. This atmosphere contrasts with the later Ottoman mosques (see for example the works of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]]'s chief architect, [[Mimar Sinan]].) The mosques that were built after the [[fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] ([[Istanbul]]) by the Ottoman Turks in 1453, and influenced by the design of the 6th century Byzantine basilica of [[Hagia Sophia]], had increasingly elevated and large central domes, which create a vertical emphasis that is intended to be more overwhelming; to convey the divine power of Allah, the majesty of the Ottoman Sultan, and the governmental authority of the Ottoman State.

== Jewish community ==
Bursa, initially home to a small [[Romaniote Jews|Romaniote Jewish]] community, underwent a demographic shift with the arrival of [[Sephardic Jews]] who were [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|expelled from the Iberian Peninsula]] in the late 15th century. The Sephardic majority quickly absorbed the Romaniotes, leading to a cultural and numerical dominance. [[Judaeo-Spanish]] became the daily language, and the community paid its [[Jizya|poll tax]] through the representative, the ''kahya''.<ref name=":03222">{{Cite book |last=Bornstein-Makovetsky |first=Leah |url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/*-SIM_0007390 |title=Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World |publisher=Brill Reference Online |editor-last=Stillman |editor-first=Norman A. |chapter=Bursa}}</ref>

Throughout the Ottoman period, most Jews resided in Kuruçeşme, Bursa's Jewish quarter, home to three [[synagogue]]s. Etz Chaim (Eṣ Ḥayyim), the oldest, predated [[Siege of Bursa|Ottoman conquest]], while the Gerush and Mayor synagogues were established by Sephardic newcomers. Despite the 1851 fire destroying Etz Chaim, the other two remain, along with the Berut synagogue. Bursa also had a Jewish cemetery until recently.<ref name=":03222"/>

Though never a major center, Bursa's Jewish population fluctuated. Dubious data suggests 683 families in 1571/72, dropping to 141 by 1696/97. By 1883, there were 2,179 Jews, with an influx of 400 from [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi|Akkerman]] in 1887. Pre-[[World War I]], the population reached 3,500, but emigration reduced it to 140 by the early 21st century.<ref name=":03222"/>

Engaged in the local economy, Bursa's Jews were shop owners and involved in guilds. In the 16th and 17th centuries, they excelled in textile manufacturing, silk trade, [[goldsmith]]ing, and finance. Despite economic struggles in the 18th and 19th centuries, a 1886 report highlighted poverty.<ref name=":03222"/>

Bursa faced blood libels in 1592 and 1865. Despite its size, the community produced renowned [[Halakha|halakhic]] scholars across centuries. Modern schooling arrived in 1886 with [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]], but it closed in 1923 during the secularization program. Jewish children then attended Turkish schools for a modern education.<ref name=":03222" />
