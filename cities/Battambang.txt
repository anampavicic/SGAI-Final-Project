'''Battambang''' ({{lang-km|បាត់ដំបង}}, [[Romanization of Khmer#UNGEGN|UNGEGN]]: {{transl|km|Bătdâmbâng}} {{IPA-km|ɓatɗɑmɓɑːŋ|}}) is the capital of [[Battambang Province]] and the [[List of cities and towns in Cambodia|third largest city]] in Cambodia.

Founded in the 11th century by the [[Khmer Empire]], Battambang is the leading rice-producing province of the country. For nearly 100 years, it was a major commercial hub and the capital of the [[Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782–1932)|Siamese]] province of Inner Cambodia (1795–1907), though it was always populated by Khmer people, with some ethnic Vietnamese, Lao, Thai, and Chinese. Battambang remains the hub of Cambodia's northwest, connecting the region with [[Phnom Penh]] and [[Thailand]].

The city is situated on the [[Sangkae River]], a small body of water that winds its way through [[Battambang Province]]. As with much of Cambodia, French Colonial architecture is a notable aspect of the city, with some of the best-preserved examples in the country. On 31 October 2023, Battambang was one of 55 cities declared to join the UNESCO [[Creative Cities Network]] in the field of [[City of Gastronomy|gastronomy as well as  crafts and folk art, design, film, literature, media arts, and music]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Dunston |first=Lara |date=19 November 2023 |title=How a sleepy town in Cambodia won a place on Unsesco's culinary map |work=The Observer |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/nov/19/how-a-sleepy-town-in-cambodia-won-a-place-on-unsescos-culinary-map |access-date=19 November 2023 |issn=0029-7712}}</ref> Other cities, such as [[Kratié (town)|Kratie]], [[Siem Reap]], and [[Kampot (city)|Kampot]], may follow for the next cycle in 2025 onwards.<ref>{{cite web |title= UNESCO supported Battambang promote Creative Cities Network UCCN|url=https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-supported-battambang-promote-creative-cities-network-uccn |website=unesco.org |access-date=19 June 2023 |ref=unesco uccn for battambang}}</ref>

==History==
{{More citations needed|section|date=February 2024}}

Battambang was established as an important trading city with around 2,500 residents in the 18th century. The population was centered along a single road parallel to the [[Sangkae River]] (''Stung Sangkae''). In 1795, Siam (modern-day [[Thailand]]) annexed much of northwestern Cambodia, including the current provinces of [[Banteay Meanchey Province|Banteay Meanchey]], [[Battambang Province|Battambang]], [[Oddar Meanchey Province|Oddar Meanchey]], [[Pailin]], and [[Siem Reap Province|Siem Reap]], into the province of Inner Cambodia. The Siamese ruled Battambang as a provincial capital through the Thai-speaking Khmer [[House of Abhaiwongse|Abhaiwongse family]],<ref name=Goscha>{{cite book |last=Goscha |first=Christopher E. |date=1999 |title=Thailand and the Southeast Asian Networks of the Vietnamese Revolution, 1885–1954 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RE5XmjajAvkC&q=Aphaiwong |location=Surrey, UK |publisher=Curzon Press, Nordic Institute of Asian Studies |page= 123 |isbn=0700706224 |access-date=3 December 2013}}</ref> a branch of the Khmer royal family, which governed for six generations until 1907, when the province was ceded to the French to be reunited with Cambodia as part of the [[French Indochina]] colony.

Following colonization by the French, an urban layout was developed, which resulted in an enlarged French colonial town. This first attempt at modernization led to well-defined streets laid in a grid pattern, building of urban structures and three main streets parallel to the Sangkae River, and the linking of both banks by the construction of two bridges in 1917. Military and prison facilities were also erected. Nineteen years later, a second urban development plan was implemented, with a newly constructed [[Rail transport in Cambodia|railway]] linking Battambang to [[Phnom Penh]]. The urban structures were extended to the west of the town, creating urban hubs oriented around the railway station. The large residential villas and public buildings built during this period of French development significantly changed the landscape of the previously remote city. A subsequent third urban development plan for Battambang involved the north, east, and south of the city. This vast undertaking, which required long-term planning to integrate all of the previous work, resulted in a modern provincial capital that was by far the most developed region of Cambodia outside of Phnom Penh.

Much later, more infrastructure and public facilities were built under the modernization program of the Cambodian government led by prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]]. Several provincial departments, a courthouse, and other public buildings were added on both sides of the river. Textile and garment factories were built by French and Chinese investors, the [[Battambang Airport]] was constructed, and the railway line was extended to the Thai border at [[Poipet]]. To serve the cultural needs of the population, numerous schools and a university were built as well as a sports centre, museum, and an exhibition hall.

==Transportation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2024}}

Battambang is accessible via road and rail. There are buses that run between the city and [[Bangkok]], Phnom Penh, and Siem Reap. The railway line between Phnom Penh and Poipet has been rehabilitated, allowing access via [[Battambang Royal railway station]].

Battambang Airport was previously reserved for military use but opened with limited services for small airplanes and helicopters in 2018.

There is also (except during the lowest water levels of the dry season) a daily boat connection between Battambang and Siem Reap via the Sangkae River. Since buses are faster and cheaper, the scenic trip is nowadays used mainly by tourists and some locals who live along the river.
