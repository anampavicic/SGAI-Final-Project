It is a longstanding political center, and is located at approximately equal distances from the [[Southern Carpathians]] (north) and the [[Danube|River Danube]] (south). Craiova is the chief commercial city west of [[Bucharest]] and the most important city of Oltenia. The city prospered as a regional trading centre despite an earthquake in 1790, a plague in 1795, and a [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] assault in 1802 during which it was burned.

Eight villages are administered by the city: Făcăi, Mofleni, Popoveni, Șimnicu de Jos, Cernele, Cernelele de Sus, Izvoru Rece, and Rovine. The last four were a separate commune called ''Cernele'' until 1996, when they were merged into the city.

==Etymology and names==
There are two possible etymologies for Craiova: [[Common Slavonic|Old Slavonic]] ''[[wikt:kral|kral]]'' ("king"), which has been borrowed in Romania as ''[[wikt:crai|crai]]'' and Slavonic ''[[krajina]]'' ("border" or "edge").<ref name="Rădvan"/> Since no source prior to 1475 mentions the city, it is impossible to tell which of the two words is the real etymology.<ref name="Rădvan">Laurențiu Rădvan, ''At Europe's Borders: Medieval Towns in the Romanian Principalities,'' Brill, 2010, {{ISBN|9789004180109}}, p.272</ref> The name is probably of Serbian origin, due to historical [[Autochthon (ancient Greece)|autochthonous]] minorities in the area. 

In Hungarian, the town is either referred to as {{lang|hu|Királyi}}, a remnant of the city's Hungarian rule during the [[Árpád dynasty]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Faragó |first=Imre |year=2021 |editor1-last=Zentai |editor1-first=László |editor2-last=Török |editor2-first=Zsolt Győző |title=Az ezredéves térkép tájnevei |trans-title=The names of physical geographical regions on a thousand-year-old map |url=http://lazarus.elte.hu/hun/digkonyv/sc/sc16/sc-16.pdf |format=PDF |journal=Studia Cartologica – Térképtudományi Tanulmányok |language=hu |location=Budapest |publisher=ELTE Térképtudományi és Geoinformatikai Intézet |volume=16 |page=131 |issn=0495-1719 |access-date=7 August 2022 |quote=A középkorban fő helye Királyi [Craiova], neve utal az Árpád-kori magyar hatalomra. |trans-quote=In the Middle Ages, its main seat was Királyi [Craiova], the name of which refers to the Hungarian rule during the Árpád dynasty.}}</ref> or as {{lang|hu|Krajova}}.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fábián |first1=Attila |last2=Forman |first2=Balázs |editor-last=Fábián |editor-first=Attila |year=2011 |chapter=Románia |trans-chapter=Romania |title=Alkalmazott strukturális politikák Közép-Európában |trans-title=Applied structural policies in Central Europe |url=http://publicatio.nyme.hu/890/1/Fabian___Alkalmazott_strukturalis_politika___konyv_u.pdf |format=PDF |language=hu |location=Sopron |publisher=[[University of Sopron]] |pages=345–352 |isbn=978-963-334-002-8 |access-date=8 August 2022 |quote=Sud-Vest régió legnagyobb városa, Krajova (Dolzs megye központja) a Zsil folyó közelében fekszik. |trans-quote=The largest city in the Sud-Vest region, Craiova (the centre of Dolj County), is located near the river Jiu. |quote-page=346}}</ref> The German name of the city is {{lang|de|Krajowa}}.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Leitner |first=Erich |date=5 April 2019 |title=Vom Balkanesel zum Verkaufsschlager |trans-title=From Balkan donkey to best seller |url=https://www.hsu-hh.de/ordnung/wp-content/uploads/sites/549/2019/04/Schuldenbremse-ad%25C3%25A9_JF_190405.pdf |format=PDF |department=Wirtschaft |journal=[[Junge Freiheit]] |language=de |location=Berlin |volume=19 |issue=15 |page=10 |issn=0932-660X |access-date=8 August 2022 |quote=Die 21.684 in Deutschland verkauften Mini-SUV EcoSport stammten von Ford România aus Krajowa (Királyi/Craiova). |trans-quote=The 21,684 EcoSport mini SUVs sold in Germany came from Ford Romania in Krajowa (Királyi/Craiova).}}</ref>

Craiova, which occupied the site of the [[Dacia]]n and [[Roman Dacia|Roman]] city ''[[Pelendava]]'', was formerly the capital of Oltenia. Its ancient ''[[ban (title)|ban]]s'', the highest ranking [[boyars]] of the [[Wallachia]]n state, were initially those of the [[Craiovești]] family. The ''bans'' had the right of [[Mint (coin)|minting coins]] stamped with their own [[Effigy|effigies]] – the origin of the [[Romanian language|Romanian]] word ''[[Romanian leu|ban]]'' as used for coins.
[[File:Mihai Viteazul woodcut.jpg|thumb|left|[[Michael the Brave]]]]

The economic power of the Craiovești family at the end of the 16th century was about 100 villages (182 financial goods). This power gave them a statute of political autonomy so big, that the [[hospodar]]s ruling at that time were not able to keep in power without an alliance with this powerful dynasty. From the Craiovești family there were chosen a lot of hospodars to rule the country: [[Neagoe Basarab]], [[Radu of Afumați|Radu de la Afumați]], [[Radu Șerban]] (1602–1611), [[Matei Basarab]], [[Constantin Șerban]], [[Șerban Cantacuzino]], [[Constantin Brâncoveanu]].

In 1395 Craiova was probably the scene of a victory won by the [[List of rulers of Wallachia|Wallachian Prince]] [[Mircea I of Wallachia]] over [[Bayezid I]], [[Ottoman Dynasty|Sultan]] of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] (''see [[Battle of Rovine]]''). {{citation needed|date=July 2008}}

Frequently referred to as "a city" after the first half of the 16th century, the Craiova area was always regarded as an important economic region of [[Wallachia]] and Romania at large. During the 1718–1739 [[Habsburg monarchy|Habsburg]] occupation of Oltenia (see [[Banat of Craiova]]), Craiova's status declined due to economic pressures and increased [[Centralized government|centralism]], partly leading to an increase in ''[[hajduk]]'' actions, in parallel with protests of Craiovan [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyars]]. In 1761, under Prince [[Constantine Mavrocordatos]], the ''bans'' relocated to Bucharest, leaving behind ''[[kaymakam]]s'' to represent them in Craiova.

Under Prince [[Emanuel Giani Ruset]], Wallachia's seat was moved to Craiova (1770–1771), viewed as a place of refuge during the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1768-1774|Russo-Turkish War of 1768–1774]]. A large part of the city was burned down by the rebel [[pasha]] [[Osman Pazvantoğlu]] in 1800.

During the [[Wallachian uprising of 1821]], inhabitants of the present-day [[Dolj County]] joined [[Tudor Vladimirescu]]'s [[Vladimirescu's Pandurs|Pandurs]] in great numbers, contributing to the expedition on Bucharest. During the first two decades of the 19th century, Craiova witnessed economic prosperity, centered on [[handicraft]] trades and public services. During [[Imperial Russia]]n occupation and the early stages of ''[[Regulamentul Organic|Organic Statute]]'' rules (1828–1834), the city increased its economic output; in 1832 there were 595 shops, 197 of which were made [[barracks]] and 398 were houses built of brick. At the time, Craiova exported wheat, furs, leather, live animals and other products into the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s.

Costache Romanescu, a citizen of Craiova, was among the leaders of the Provisional Government during the [[1848 Wallachian revolution]]. Wallachia's last two rulers, [[Gheorghe Bibescu]] and [[Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei]], came from an important boyar family residing in Craiova – the Bibescu family.

Around 1860, there were 4,633 buildings in Craiova, which were 3,220 houses, 26 churches, 11 schools and 60 factories and workshops. In all, the city also housed about 90 industrial establishments, of which 12 were mills, 3 breweries, 2 gas and oil factories, 4 [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] yards and 2 [[printing press]]es; 57% of the total number of craftsmen of [[Dolj County]] lived in Craiova (1,088 [[Master craftsman|craftsmen]], 687 [[journeymen]] and 485 [[Apprenticeship|apprentices]]).

[[File:Craiova - Lipscani Street (28456496140).jpg|thumb|right|Lipscani Street in Craiova]]

The period following the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Independence War]] was a time of economic and cultural progress. As a result, at the end of the 19th century, the city of Craiova, with its 40,000 inhabitants, had developed small factories (producing chemicals, farming utilities, and construction materials) and textile factories. On October 26, 1896, the Craiova [[power station]] entered service (with [[AEG (German company)|AEG]] equipment working at 310 CP, supplying 365 streetlights on 39 streets, forming a 30&nbsp;km-long network); Craiova was the first city in the country to be supplied with electric power by [[internal combustion engine]]s.

In 1900, Craiova had 43.1% of the industrial units of [[Oltenia]]; these numbered 924 industrial companies (including 20 large industrial establishments, employing 1,078 workers). The number of large industrial establishments rose to 40 by 1925. [[Banking]] also developed at the beginning of the 20th century (when 6 banks and 2 [[Bureau de change|bureaux de change]] were already operating).

In the interwar period, Craiova, as the centre of an agricultural region, experienced little further [[industrialization]]; the number of industrial workers remained comparatively small. In 1939, Craiova had 7 industrial units with over 100 workers: the clothing industry companies ''Oltenia'' and ''Scrisul Românesc'' were well-known all over the country and abroad.  The [[Treaty of Craiova]] was signed here on 7 September 1940; under its terms, Romania ceded to [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] the territory of [[Southern Dobruja]], which Romania had gained after the 1913 [[Second Balkan War]].

In the early 1960s, under the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]], the city became a centre for the [[Automaker|automotive]] and [[engine building]] industries, as well as for [[Aerospace manufacturer|aerospace manufacturing]], [[chemical industry]], [[food industry]], [[construction]], [[electrical engineering]], [[mining]] and the [[electrical power industry]]. The construction of housing estates also begins at this time, with Brazda lui Novac being one of the first in 1967–1968, followed by Siloz-Valea Roșie in the same years. Later on in the 1980s the Craiovița Nouă, Rovine, 1 Mai, Sărari and Lăpuș-Argeș housing estates are built.

After the [[Romanian Revolution|1989 Revolution]] brought the re-establishment of a [[free market]] and decentralisation in overall management, several industries became subject to [[privatisation]], while the market opened itself to private initiatives. Industry, although affected by economic changes, remains an important branch, representing circa 70% of Craiova's output.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Craiova has a [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa''), bordering on a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa''). This results in a combination of occasional cold winters, but too mild of a climate to contain permanent snow cover, along with long and hot summers.

Annually, Craiova experiences 64 days with [[fog]], more frequently in winter than other seasons. The city also experiences 34 days per year with thunder, and 1 day with [[hail]].<ref name=NCEI/>

==Economy==
{{unreferencedsect|date=August 2024}}
[[File:First Ford Transit at Automobile Craiova.jpg|thumb|left|First Ford Transit at Automobile Craiova]]

In the first two decades of the 19th century, Craiova was characterized by economic growth and the increased presence of trade, commerce, and public services. Similarly to other large urban areas, Craiova became a commercial, administrative and cultural centre.

During the [[Tsarist]] take-over (1828–1834), Craiova experienced significant economic growth. In 1832, there were 595 shops, of which "187 [were] of wood and 398 of stone wall". The city was the commercial centre of [[Oltenia]]. It exported cereal, skins, wax, animals, tallow and services to [[Austria]] and [[Turkey]]. As a consequence of the permanent high demand for exports, Craiova was the site of the first Romanian society for shares in cereal shipping on the [[Danube]] to [[Brăila]], established in 1846.

Around 1860 in Craiova there were 4633 buildings, of which 3220 were houses, 26 churches, 11 schools, and 60 factories or workshops. There were also approximately 90 establishments with an industrial character, of which 12 were [[wind mill]]s, 3 beer factories, 2 gas and oil factories, 4 tanneries, and 2 were printing houses. Statistics show that Craiova was home to 57.7% of the total number of craftsmen in [[Dolj County]] (1088 craftsmen, 687 journeymen and 485 apprentices). Towards the end of the 19th century, the city of Craiova had small factories and workshops with chemical products, agricultural machines, graphic design, tanneries, textiles, construction materials, among others. On 26 October 1896, Craiova's power plant (using [[AEG (German company)|AEG]] equipment) began operations, supplying 365 lamps on 39 streets in a {{convert|30|km|2|abbr=on}} network. Craiova was the first city in the country powered by electricity based on internal combustion engines.

In 1900, Craiova held 43.1% of the industrial units in Oltenia, having 924 industrial firms (of which 20 establishments belonged to heavy industry, using 1078 workers). In 1925, the number of heavy industry establishments had increased to 49, and in 1930 the number of workers was 5530. The banking industry was also present; at the beginning of the 20th century, there were 6 banks and 2 bureaux de change.

In the [[Interbellum|inter-war period]], the city, situated in an eminently agricultural area, was considered to be industrialising too slowly in comparison with other urban areas of Romania. 

In 1939, there were only 7 industrial units with over 100 workers in Craiova: the "Oltenia" clothing factory, the "Scrisul Românesc" ("The Romanian Writing") publishing house, the "Concordia" macaroni factory, the "Barbu Druga" bread and macaroni factory, the "Semănătoarea" factory and the "Traiul" bread factory.
The only branch of industry at the same level of development as other centers of the country was graphic art. The two printing houses "Ramuri" and  "Scrisul Românesc" were well-known all over Romania and abroad.

Starting in the 1960s the city became a powerful industrial center; it developed industry in machinery, tools, aircraft, chemicals, food, light industry, construction materials, electronics, extraction, and energy. The [[Romanian Revolution of 1989]] led to important changes in the economy, with the introduction of a free market and decentralization of the management of all national economic sectors. 
In industry, an overall drop in production capacity was noted, caused by an inability to anticipate the impact of change and the economic shocks that followed the change of system. Nevertheless, industry continues to represent the largest sector of the city's economy (70%).

== Politics ==

The Craiova Municipal Council, chosen at the [[2020 Romanian local election|2020 local election]], is made up of 27 councillors, with the following party composition:

==Transportation==

[[File:Craiova BMC bus 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A city bus in Craiova running on route 6]]

Public transportation in Craiova started in September 1948 with only 2 buses, received from [[Bucharest]]. The buses connected the [[Craiova railway station]] with the [[Nicolae Romanescu Park]]. The [[tram]] was first introduced in 1987, on an {{convert|18.4|km|2|abbr=on}} double-track line, as a result of the state's intention of keeping energy consumption low.
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Trasee rat craiova.jpg|thumb|Public transportation lines]] -->
The [[public transport]] in Craiova today consists of 3 tram lines and 17 bus lines. It is operated by the {{ill|RAT Craiova|ro}}, a corporation run by City Hall. There are 190 buses and 35 trams serving the city today.

Craiova is also a major railway [[Craiova railway station|centre]] and is connected to all other major Romanian cities, as well as local destinations, through the national [[Căile Ferate Române]] network.

There are daily trains with service from Craiova to:
[[Bucharest]] (3 hours),
[[Brașov]] (6 – 8 hours - via connecting service),
