Founded 2,600 years ago as the [[Colonies in antiquity#Greek colonies|ancient Greek colony]] [[Pantikapaion]], Kerch is one of the most ancient cities in Crimea. The city experienced rapid growth starting in the 1920s and was the site of [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula|a major battle]] during World War II.

Today, it is one of the largest cities in Crimea and is among the area's most important industrial, transport and tourist centres. As with the rest of Crimea, it has been occupied by Russian forces since the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|Russian annexation of Crimea]] in 2014.

==History==
{{stack|[[File:Kerch Pantikapaeum.jpg|thumb|Ruins of [[Panticapaeum]] from the 6th century BC]]}}
===Ancient times===
Archeological digs at Mayak village near the city ascertained that the area had already been inhabited in the 17th–15th centuries BC. While many finds from Kerch can be found in the [[Hermitage Museum]] in St Petersburg and the local museum, a large number of antique sculptures, reliefs, bronze and glassware, ceramics and jewellery were excavated in 1855–1856 during the [[Crimean War]] by Duncan MacPherson, a surgeon from the British Army, and later donated to the [[British Museum]] in London.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIOG61062| title = British Museum Collection}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/BIOG59348?id=BIOG59348&page=1#page-top| title = British Museum Collection}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = https://opacplus.bsb-muenchen.de/Vta2/bsb10221604/bsb:BV020307300?page=7| title = Antiquities of Kertch, and Researches in the Cimmerian Bosphorus, with Remarks on the ethnological and physical History of the Crimea by Duncan MacPherson ( 1857 ) }}</ref>

Kerch as a city starts its history in the 7th century BC, when [[Greeks|Greek colonists]] from [[Miletus]] founded a city-state named [[Panticapaeum]]<ref>See [[Talk:Kerch#Meaning of Greek name?]] for discussion about the Greek name Panticapaeum.</ref> on [[Mount Mithridat]] near the mouth of the Melek-Chesme river. Panticapaeum subdued nearby cities and by 480 BC became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Bosporus]]. Later, during the rule of [[Mithradates VI Eupator]], Panticapaeum for a short period of time became the capital of the much more powerful and extensive [[Kingdom of Pontus]].
The city was located at the intersection of trade routes between the [[steppe]] and [[Europe]]. This caused it to grow rapidly. The city's main exports were grain and salted fish; wine-making was also common. Panticapaeum minted its own coins. According to extant documents the Melek-Chesme river (small and shallow nowadays) was navigable in Bosporan times, and sea [[galley]]s were able to enter the river. A large portion of the city's population was ethnically [[Scythian]], later [[Sarmatian]], as the large royal barrow ([[Kurgan]]) at [[Kul-Oba]] testifies.

In the 1st century AD Panticapaeum and the Kingdom of Bosporus suffered from [[Ostrogoth]] raids; then the city was devastated by the [[Huns]] in AD 375.

[[Myrmekion]] was founded in the eastern part of the Kerch, 4&nbsp;km NE of ancient [[Panticapaeum]]. The settlement was founded by [[Ionians]] in the first half of the 6th c. BC.<ref>{{cite web|last=Butyagin |first=Alexander|url= http://blacksea.ehw.gr/forms/filePage.aspx?lemmaId=10725 |title=Myrmekion|publisher=Foundation of the Hellenic World|date=29 July 2008|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref>

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Yenikale fortress in Kerch.jpg|thumb|Yenikale fortress]]

From the 6th century the city was under the control of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. By order of Emperor [[Justinian I]], a citadel named Bospor was built there. Bospor was the centre of a [[bishopric]], the [[diocese of Bosporus]] and developed under the influence of Greek [[Christianity]]. In 576, it withstood a siege by the [[Göktürks]] under Bokhan, aided by Anagai, the last [[khan (title)|khan]] (ruler) of the [[Uturgurs]] (tribe of [[Huns]]).
[[File:Kerch ChurchOfStJohn.jpg|thumb|left|Church of St John the Baptist, built in the 8th century]]

In the 7th century, the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Khazars]] took control of Bospor, and the city was named '''Karcha''' from Turkic "karşı" meaning 'opposite, facing.' The main local government official during Khazar times was the [[tudun]]. 
During Khazar rule, Kerch was used as a major port for the [[Khazar slave trade]], through which slaves were exported to the [[Black Sea slave trade]].<ref>The World of the Khazars: New Perspectives. Selected Papers from the Jerusalem 1999 International Khazar Colloquium. (2007). Nederländerna: Brill. p. 233</ref>

Christianity was a major religion in Kerch during the period of Khazar rule. Kerch's Church of [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]] was founded in 717; thus, it is the oldest church in Ukraine.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cohen |first=Saul Bernard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C6PLxz8EMk0C&dq=Kerch+John+Baptist+oldest+church+in+Ukraine&pg=PA1876 |title=The Columbia Gazetteer of the World: A to G |year=2008 |pages=1876}}</ref> The Church of the Apostles existed during the late 8th and early 9th centuries, according to the ''Life of the Apostle Andrew'' by [[Epiphanius of Salamis]]. 

Following the fall of Khazaria to [[Kievan Rus']] in the late 10th century, Kerch became the centre of a Khazar [[successor-state]]. Its ruler, [[Georgius Tzul]], was deposed by a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]]-[[Kievan Rus'|Rus]] expedition in 1016.

From the 10th century, the city was a [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] settlement named Korchev, which belonged to the [[Tmutarakan]] principality. Kerch was a center of trade between Russia', [[Crimea]], [[Caucasus]] and the [[Orient]]. 

In the 13th century, Crimea including Korchev was invaded by [[Mongol invasion of Rus|Mongols]]. After the Mongols, the city became the [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]] colony of Cerco (Cherkio) in 1318 and served as a sea harbour, where townspeople worked at salt works and fishery.

In 1475, the city was passed to the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the Turkish rule Kerch fell into decay and served as a [[History of slavery|slave-market]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Inalcik |first=Halil|chapter=Servile Labor in the Ottoman Empire |chapter-url= http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu:80/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html |editor1-last=Ascher |editor-first1=Abraham |editor2-last=Király |editor-first2=Béla K. |editor2-link=Béla Király|editor3-last= Halasi-Kun |editor-first3=  Tibor|title=The Mutual Effects of the Islamic and Judeo-Christian Worlds: The East European Pattern|place=Brooklyn, N.Y.|publisher=Brooklyn College Press|year=1979|pages=25–43|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170504102244/http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu:80/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html|archive-date=4 May 2017}}</ref> It repeatedly suffered from raids of [[Zaporizhian Sich|Zaporizhian Cossacks]].

===18th–20th centuries===
[[File:Kerch aivazovsky.jpg|thumb|''Kerch'' by [[Ivan Aivazovsky]], 1839]]

In response to the strengthening of [[Russian Empire|Russia]]n military forces in [[Sea of Azov|Azov]] area, the Turks built a fortress, named [[Yenikale]], near Kerch on the shore of [[Kerch Strait]]. The fortress was completed by 1706. In 1771 the [[Imperial Russian Army]] invaded [[Crimea]] and approached Yenikale. The Turks decided to abandon the fortress, though reinforcements from the Ottoman Empire had arrived a few days earlier. By the Peace [[Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji]] in 1774, Kerch and Yenikale were ceded to Russia. As a result, the Turkish heritage has been almost completely wiped out.

In 1790 Russian naval forces under the command of admiral [[Fyodor Fyodorovich Ushakov|Fyodor Ushakov]] defeated the Turkish fleet at the [[Battle of Kerch Strait (1790)|Battle of Kerch Strait]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/mf-black.htm| title= Black Sea Fleet (BSF) Morskoyo Flota ( Naval Force)|website=GlobalSecurity.org|access-date=29 October 2018}}</ref>

Because of its location, from 1821 Kerch developed into an important trade and fishing port. The state museum of ancient times and a number of educational institutions were opened in the city. The ironwork factory was built in 1846 based on a huge [[iron ore]] deposit found on Kerch Peninsula.

During the [[Crimean War]] the city was devastated by [[British Empire|British]] forces in 1855.

In the late 19th century, mechanical and [[cement]] factories were built, and tinned food and [[tobacco]] factories were established. By 1900, Kerch was connected to a railroad system, and the fairway of Kerch Strait was deepened and widened. At this time, the population had reached 33,000.

After suffering a decline during the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[Russian Civil War]], the city resumed its growth in the late 1920s, with the expansion of various industries, iron ore, and metallurgy in particular, and by 1939 its population had reached 104,500.

===Kerch in World War II===
[[File:Керчь. Обелиск Славы на вершине горы Митридат..jpg|thumb|{{Ill|Monument of Glory in Kerch|uk|Обеліск Слави (Керч)}}]]

On the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of World War II]] from 1941 to 1945, Kerch was the site of heavy fighting between [[Red Army]] and [[Axis powers|Axis]] forces. After fierce fighting, the city was taken by the [[Germany|Germans]] in November 1941. On 31 December 1941, the [[302nd Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|302nd Mountain Rifle Division]] recaptured the city following a naval landing operation at Kamysh Burun, to the south of the city, five days earlier.<ref>{{cite book|last=Forczyk|first=Robert|title=Where the Iron Crosses Grow|publisher=Osprey Publishing|place=Oxford, UK|year=2014|pages=103, 110}}</ref> In 1942 the Germans occupied the city again. The Red Army lost over 160,000 men, either killed or taken [[POW]] at the [[Battle of the Kerch Peninsula (1942)|Battle of the Kerch Peninsula]]. On 31 October 1943 another Soviet naval landing operation was launched. Kerch returned to Soviet control on 11 April 1944.

The German invaders killed about 15,000 citizens and deported another 14,000 during their occupation. Evidence of German atrocities in Kerch was presented in the [[Nuremberg trials]]. After the war, the city was awarded the title [[Hero City (Soviet Union)|Hero City]].

The [[Defense of the Adzhimushkay quarry|Adzhimushkay]] [[catacombs]] in the city's suburbs were the site of [[guerrilla warfare]] against the occupation. Thousands of soldiers and refugees found shelter inside and were involved in counterattacks. Many of them died underground, including those who died of numerous alleged poison gas attacks. Later, a memorial was established on the site.

On 11 November 2007, a powerful storm passed through the city, causing much damage and an ecological disaster as a few ships, including an oil tanker, were shipwrecked and blocked the [[Kerch Strait]].

===Russian occupation===
{{expand section|date=September 2023}}
As with the other parts of Crimea, {{as of|2023|lc=yes}} Kerch is occupied by Russian forces following the [[Russian occupation of Crimea]] in 2014.

[[File:Керчь.Главная улица .Сентябрь. ..jpg|thumb|Lenina street in Kerch]]

Because of its location on the shores of the [[Sea of Azov|Azov]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas, Kerch became a popular summer resort among people of the former [[Soviet Union|USSR]]. Also, several mud-cure sources are located near the city. Despite the seaside location, the tourist appeal of Kerch today is limited because of the industrial character of the city and associated pollution.
Despite the lack of beaches in the town's area, there are a lot of them at a distance of 20 minutes' travel by bus, train or taxi.

Kerch has a number of impressive architectural and historical monuments. Ancient historical heritage of the city makes it attractive for scientific tourism. The most notable of Kerch's sights are:
*Site of ancient settlement Pantikapaeum (5th century BC–3rd century AD).
*[[Royal Kurgan (Kerch)|Tsarskiy Kurghan]] (4th century BC) – burial mound for one of the Bosporian kings
*Church of [[John the Baptist|St. John the Baptist]] (AD 717)
*[[Yenikale|Fortress of Yenikale]] (18th century)
*The Great Mithridates Staircase leading on top of the [[Mount Mithridat]], contains 428 footsteps, built in 1833–1840 under the guidance of [[Italy|Italian]] architect [[Alexander Digbi]]
*Obelisk of Glory on the [[Mount Mithridat]], built after World War II
*[[Lapidarium, Kerch|Lapidarium]]
*Memorial of heroic [[Defense of the Adzhimushkay quarry|guerilla warfare in Adzhimushkay mines]]
*[[Kerch (fortress)|Kerch Fortress]]; restricted area in Soviet times but free to enter in present days. The fortress was built by the Russian military architect [[Eduard Totleben|Totleben]] in the middle of 19th century.
* Sites of ancient settlements Mirmecium, Tiritaka and Nimphei. There are also some settlements which have gone underwater due to earthquakes.
* So called [[Demeter|Demetra]]'s Crypt, a crypt with numerous frescos dated 1st century BC.
