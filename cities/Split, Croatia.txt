It lies on the eastern shore of the [[Adriatic Sea]] and is spread over a central peninsula and its surroundings. An intraregional transport hub and popular tourist destination, the city is linked to the [[List of islands in the Adriatic|Adriatic islands]] and the [[Apennine Peninsula]]. More than 900,000 tourists visit it each year.<ref>{{cite web |title=Split Tourist Visits in 2019 |url=https://split.gg/split-tourist-visits-2019/#:~:text=Split%20city%20had%20a%20total%20of%20932%2C722%20tourist%20arrivals%20in%202019. |website=Split.gg | date=16 January 2020 |access-date=17 November 2023}}</ref>

The city was founded as the [[Greek colonisation|Greek colony]] of Aspálathos ({{Lang-grc-gre|Ἀσπάλαθος}}) in the 3rd or 2nd century BCE on the coast of the [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] {{lang|la|[[Dalmatae]]|itaic=no}}, and in 305 CE, it became the site of [[Diocletian's Palace|the Palace]] of the Roman emperor [[Diocletian]]. It became a prominent settlement around 650 when it succeeded the ancient capital of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]], [[Salona]]. After the sack of Salona by the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] and [[South Slavs|Slavs]], the fortified Palace of Diocletian was settled by Roman refugees. Split became a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] city. Later it drifted into the sphere of the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Kingdom of Croatia (925–1102)|Kingdom of Croatia]], with the Byzantines retaining nominal suzerainty. For much of the [[High Middle Ages|High]] and [[Late Middle Ages]], Split enjoyed autonomy as a free city of the [[Dalmatian city-states]], caught in the middle of a struggle between Venice and [[Croatia in personal union with Hungary|Croatia]] for control over the Dalmatian cities.

Venice eventually prevailed and during the [[early modern period]] Split remained a Venetian city, a heavily fortified outpost surrounded by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] territory. Its hinterland was won from the Ottomans in the [[Morean War]] of 1699, and in 1797, as [[Fall of the Republic of Venice|Venice fell]] to [[Napoleon]], the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]] rendered the city to the [[Habsburg monarchy]]. In 1805, the [[Peace of Pressburg (1805)|Peace of Pressburg]] added it to the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and in 1806 it was included in the [[First French Empire|French Empire]], becoming part of the [[Illyrian Provinces]] in 1809. After being occupied in 1813, it was eventually granted to the [[Austrian Empire]] following the [[Congress of Vienna]], where the city remained a part of the Austrian [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]] until the fall of [[Austria-Hungary]] in 1918 and the [[Creation of Yugoslavia|formation]] of [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]. In [[World War II in Yugoslavia|World War II]], the city [[Governatorate of Dalmatia|was annexed by Italy]], then liberated by the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] after the [[Armistice of Cassibile|Italian capitulation]] in 1943. It was then re-occupied by [[Nazi Germany|Germany]], which granted it to its puppet [[Independent State of Croatia]]. The city was liberated again by the Partisans in 1944, and was included in the post-war [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Socialist Yugoslavia]], as part of its republic of [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]. In 1991, [[Independence of Croatia|Croatia seceded]] from Yugoslavia amid the [[Croatian War of Independence]].

==Name==
The name Aspálathos or Spálathos may come from the spiny broom (''[[Calicotome spinosa]]'', ἀσπάλαθος in Greek),<ref>{{LSJ|a)spa/laqos|ἀσπάλαθος|ref}}</ref> although it is the related Spanish broom (''[[Spartium junceum]]'', σπάρτος) that is common in the area.

After the [[Roman Republic|Roman conquest]], the name became ''Spalatum'' or ''Aspalatum'' in [[Latin language|Latin]], which in the [[Middle Ages]] evolved into ''Aspalathum'', ''Spalathum'', ''Spalatrum'' and ''Spalatro'' in the [[Dalmatian language]] of the city's [[Romance-speaking Europe|Romance]] population. The [[Venetian language|Venetian]] spelling, ''Spalato'', became official under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian rule]], in international usage by the [[Early Modern Period]] and is still the name of the city in [[Italian language|Italian]].<ref name=Magner>{{cite book |last=Magner| first=Thomas F. |editor-last1=Lencek |editor-first1=Rado L. |editor-last2=Unbegaun |editor-first2=Boris O. |title=Xenia Slavica.

Formerly, the name was thought to be related to Latin ''palatium'' 'palace', a reference to [[Diocletian's Palace]]. Various theories were developed, such as the notion that the name derives from ''S. Palatium'', an abbreviation of ''[[Salona]]e Palatium''. The erroneous "palace" etymologies were notably due to Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]], and were later mentioned by [[Thomas the Archdeacon]].<ref name="JWilkes">Wilkes, J., ''Diocletian's Palace, Split : Residence of a Retired Roman Emperor'', 17. The name ''Aspálathos'' had referred to a white thorn common in the area. Thus, contrary to popular belief, the name Spalatum has nothing to do with the Latin word for palace, ''palatium''. According to Wilkes, the erroneous etymology was notably due to Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII Porphyrogenitus]].</ref> The city is several centuries older than the palace.

===Antiquity===
{{See also|Salona|Diocletian's Palace}}

Although the beginnings of Split are traditionally associated with the construction of [[Diocletian's Palace]] in 305, the city was founded several centuries earlier as the [[Greek colonies|Greek colony]] of '''Aspálathos''', or '''Spálathos'''. It was a colony of the [[polis]] of [[Issa (colony)|Issa]], the modern-day town of [[Vis (town)|Vis]], itself a colony of the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] city of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]].{{Sfn|Novak|1957|pp=13–14}} The exact year the city was founded is not known, but it is estimated to have been in the 3rd or 2nd century BC.{{Sfn|Novak|1957|p=18}} The Greek settlement lived off trade with the surrounding [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes, mostly the [[Delmatae]].{{Sfn|Novak|1957|pp=13–14}}

[[File:Diocletian's Palace (original appearance).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|Reconstruction of the [[Diocletian's Palace|Palace of the Roman Emperor Diocletian]] in its original appearance upon completion in 305, by [[Ernest Hébrard]]]]

After the [[Illyrian Wars]] of 229 and 219 BC, the city of [[Salona]], only a short distance from Spálathos, became the capital of the Roman [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Province of Dalmatia]] and one of the [[Demography of the Roman Empire#Urbanization|largest cities of the late empire]] with 60,000 people. The history of Spálathos becomes obscure for a while at this point, being overshadowed by that of nearby Salona, to which it would later become successor. The [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]] (ruled AD 284 to 305) in 293 began the construction of an opulent and heavily fortified palace fronting the sea, near his home town of Salona, selecting the site of Spálathos (or ''Spalatum'' in Latin).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Gibbon |first1=Edward |title=The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire |publisher=Modern Library |location=New York |page=335}}</ref>{{Sfn|Novak|1957|p=30}} The Palace was built as a massive structure, much like a Roman military fortress. The palace and the city of Spalatum which formed its surroundings were at times inhabited by a population as large as 8,000 to 10,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17691 |title=Diocletian's Palace |first=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith |last=Map |website=The Megalithic Portal |access-date=16 November 2007 |archive-date=11 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111211333/http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=17691 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Between 475 and 480, the Palace hosted [[Flavius Julius Nepos]], the last recognised Emperor of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Salona was lost to the [[Ostrogothic Kingdom]] in 493, along with most of Dalmatia, but the Emperor [[Justinian I]] regained Dalmatia in 535–536.

===Middle Ages===

The [[Pannonian Avars]] [[Sack of Salona|sacked and destroyed Salona]] in 639; the surviving Romans fled to the nearby islands. The Dalmatian region and its shores were at this time settled by tribes of [[Croats]], a [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] people subservient to the Avar khagans.<ref name="jackson1887">{{Cite book |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |author=Thomas Graham Jackson |title=Dalmatia |date=1887 |chapter=Spalato |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/dalmatiaquarnero02jackuoft#page/n11/mode/2up |author-link=Thomas Graham Jackson}}</ref> The Salonitans regained the land under Severus the Great in 650 and settled the 300-year-old Palace of Diocletian, which could not be effectively besieged by the Slavic tribes of the mainland.<ref name="jackson1887" /> The Emperor [[Constans II]] granted them an Imperial mandate to establish themselves in the Palace as the City of Spalatum, which imposed upon the Croatian Slavs - at the time allies of Byzantium against the Avars - a cessation of hostilities.<ref name="jackson1887" /> The [[Temple of Jupiter, Split|Temple of Jupiter]] was rededicated to the Virgin Mary and the remains of the popular [[Saint Domnius]] were recovered from the ruins of Salona, later establishing the [[Cathedral of Saint Domnius]] as new seat of the [[Archbishop of Salona]].<ref name="jackson1887" />

Until the [[Sack of Constantinople]], Split remained a ''de jure'' possession of the [[Byzantine Empire]] as a Byzantine duchy, administered by the [[Exarchate of Ravenna]] and after 751 by Jadera ([[Zadar]]).<ref name="Fine1991">{{Cite book |last=Van Antwerp Fine |first=John |year=1991 |title=The Early Medieval Balkans |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0NBxG9Id58C&q=Tomislav+dalmatia+cities&pg=PA264 |publisher=[[University of Michigan Press]] |isbn=0-472-08149-7 |access-date=21 November 2020 |archive-date=27 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210827091837/https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0NBxG9Id58C&q=Tomislav+dalmatia+cities&pg=PA264 |url-status=live }}</ref>
Its hinterland was now home to the [[Duchy of the Croats]]. In this period, an independent [[Dalmatian language]] developed from [[Latin]], with a distinct local dialect: to its inhabitants, the city became known as '''Spalatrum''' or '''Spalatro''', one of the main [[Dalmatian city-states]].

[[File:Kip Grgura Ninskog, Split.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Statue of bishop [[Gregory of Nin]], in the ''Giardin'' Park]]

In 925, [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]]'s [[Kingdom of Croatia (medieval)|Kingdom of Croatia]] emerged in the hinterland of the city, centered in [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]] as an ally of Byzantium against [[Simeon I of Bulgaria]] - though without receiving any power from the Emperor over the Dalmatian cities.<ref name="Fine1991" /> The rise of the rival Bishopric of Nin, headed by [[Gregory of Nin|Bishop Gregory]], which attempted to institute the "Slavonic" or "Slavic language" as the language of religious service, led to the 925 Synod of Split, at which it was decreed that "no one should presume to celebrate the divine mysteries in the Slavonic language, but only in Latin and Greek, and that no one of that tongue should be advanced to the holy orders".

In 1100, the [[bell tower]] which became the main symbol of the city was constructed and dedicated to Saint Domnius, by then regarded as the [[patron saint]] of the city.

Throughout the 9th and 10th centuries, Split was raided by the [[Narentines]] (a South Slavic confederation recognizing the King of Croatia as their sovereign). Therefore, the city offered its allegiance to [[Venice]] and in 998 the [[Venice|Venetian]] Doge [[Pietro II Orseolo]], led a large naval expedition which defeated the Narentines the same year. After obtaining permission from Emperor [[Basil II]] in Constantinople, Orseolo proclaimed himself Duke of Dalmatia.
In 1019 the Byzantine Empire restored direct control over Dalmatia. The title "Duke of Dalmatia" seems to have been dropped at this point by the Venetian doges. In 1069 [[Peter Krešimir IV]], [[King of Croatia]], gained control over Dalmatian islands and cities, including Split, and stretched his rule south to [[Neretva]]. The coastal cities retained autonomous administration and were still nominally under Byzantine Empire, but were now subjects of the Croatian king.<ref name="britannica">[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/560657/Split Split] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150426225019/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/560657/Split |date=26 April 2015 }}, Encyclopædia Britannica</ref>{{Sfn|Novak|2004a|pp=48–50}}<ref>David Luscombe, Jonathan Riley-Smith: The New Cambridge Medieval History IV, c.1024 – c.1198 part II, p. 272</ref>

After the death of Croatian King [[Stephen II of Croatia|Stephen II]] in 1091, a period of [[Croatia in the union with Hungary#Succession crisis|succession crisis]] followed in Croatia, with King [[Ladislaus I of Hungary]] interfering in it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/balkans/dalmatia614802.html |title=WHKMLA : History of Dalmatia, 614-802 |website=www.zum.de |access-date=10 November 2007 |archive-date=30 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930165340/http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/balkans/dalmatia614802.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Byzantine Emperor [[Alexios I Komnenos]] took advantage of this and joined the old [[Dalmatia (theme)|Theme of Dalmatia]] to the Empire.{{Sfn|Novak|2004a|pp=48–50}}{{Sfn|Šišić|1920|page=153}} In 1096 Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, at the time engaged in the [[First Crusade]], granted the administration of Dalmatia to the Doge of Venice.{{Sfn|Šišić|1920|page=153}}

In 1105, [[Coloman, King of Hungary]], having conquered the Kingdom of Croatia, reneged on its alliance with Venice and moved on the coastal towns, besieging and taking Zadar. Split and Trogir decided then to surrender upon guarantee of their ancient privileges.<ref name="jackson1887" />
The rights granted to the city (and reaffirmed by new charters) were substantial. Split was to pay no tribute, it was to choose its own count and archbishop whom the king would confirm, it preserved its old Roman laws, and appointed its own judge. Dues from trade (which were substantial in the period), were divided between the count, the archbishop, and the king, and no foreigner was to live within the walls of the city against the will of the citizens. These rights were generally upheld by Hungarian kings, but there were inevitable incidents of violation.

After Coloman's death in 1116, the Doge [[Ordelafo Faliero]] returned from [[Outremer]] and retook all the Dalmatian cities, and also, for the first time, the Croatian cities of coast such as Biograd and [[Šibenik]]. In 1117, he was defeated and killed in renewed battle with the Hungarians under [[Stephen II of Hungary]], and Split again acknowledged Hungarian rule. The new Doge, [[Domenico Michiel]], quickly defeated the Hungarians again and restored Venetian authority by 1118. In 1124, while the Doge was engaged against the Byzantine Empire, now hostile to Venice, Stephen II recovered Split and Trogir without resistance. Upon Michele's return in 1127, the Doge yet again expelled the Hungarians from the two cities and utterly destroyed Biograd, the favored seat of the Croatian Kings that the Hungarians were attempting to establish as a rival to the Venetian Zadar.<ref name="jackson1887" />

The cities remained in Venetian hands without contest during the reign of [[Béla II of Hungary|Béla II]] but in 1141, his successor, King [[Géza II]], having conquered Bosnian lands, marched to Split and Trogir, both voluntarily accepting him as overlord. This turned out to be a definitive conquest, as Venetian rule was not to return to Split for another 186 years.

In that period, Split was to see one brief and final restoration of Imperial power in Dalmatia. The Byzantine Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] began his campaigns against the Kingdom of Croatia and Hungary in 1151, and by 1164, had secured the submission of the Dalmatian cities back under Imperial rule. Having won a decisive victory against Kingdom of Croatia and Hungary in 1167 at the [[Battle of Sirmium]], consolidating his gains, the Emperor suddenly broke with Venice as well, and sent a fleet of 150 ships to the Adriatic. Split was to remain in Byzantine hands until Manuel's death in 1180, when [[Béla III of Hungary]] moved to [[Byzantine–Hungarian War (1180–1185)|restore Hungarian power]] in Dalmatia. The city remained loyal to the Empire, resisting the re-establishment of Hungarian rule, and consequently, upon its inevitable submission, was punished with the King's refusal to renew its ancient privileges.<ref name="jackson1887" />

During the 20-year Hungarian civil war between King [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]] and the [[Capetian House of Anjou]] of the [[Kingdom of Naples]], the losing contender, [[Ladislaus of Naples]], sold his disputed rights on Dalmatia to the [[Venetian Republic]] for 100,000 [[ducats]] in 1409. Acting on the pretext, the Republic took over in the city by the year 1420.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/balkans/croat13011526.html |title=WHKMLA : History of Croatia, 1301–1526 |website=www.zum.de |access-date=10 November 2007 |archive-date=8 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208154129/http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/balkans/croat13011526.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

By this time the population was largely [[Croats|Croatian]],{{Sfn|Novak|1957|p=254}} while Romance [[Dalmatian Language|Dalmatian]] names were not as common,{{Sfn|Novak|1957|pp=254–258}} according to the Medieval city archives. The common language was [[Croatian language|Croatian]], but a variety of the [[Venetian language]] with some [[Tuscan dialect|Tuscan]] influences was also widely spoken by [[Dalmatian Italians|Dalmatian Italian]] [[Notary|notaries]], school teachers, merchants, and officials.{{Sfn|Novak|1957|pp=258–259}} The city's autonomy was greatly reduced: the highest authority was a prince and captain (''conte e capitanio''), assigned by Venice.{{Sfn|Novak|1961|p=264}}

Split eventually developed into a significant port-city, with important trade routes to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-held interior through the nearby [[Klis]] pass. Culture flourished as well, Split being the hometown of [[Marko Marulić]], the Croatian [[national poet]]. Marulić's most acclaimed work, ''[[Judita]]'' (1501), was an epic poem about [[Judith]] and [[Holofernes]], widely held to be the first modern work of [[Croatian literature]]. It was written in Split and printed in Venice in 1521.{{Sfn|Novak|1961|p=311}}

The advances and achievements were reserved mostly for the [[aristocracy]]: the [[illiteracy]] rate was extremely high, mostly because Venetian rule showed little interest in educational and medical facilities.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In 1797, Split was ceded by the [[French First Republic|French Republic]] to the [[Habsburg monarchy]] under the [[Treaty of Campo Formio]], as part of the [[Fall of the Republic of Venice|dissolution and partition]] of the ancient [[Republic of Venice]].{{Sfn|Novak|1965|p=8}}

===Napoleonic wars===

Split became part of the [[Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy]] in 1805, after the defeat of the [[Third Coalition]] at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]] and the consequent [[Treaty of Pressburg (1805)|Treaty of Pressburg]]. It was included directly in the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] in 1806. The same year, [[Vincenzo Dandolo]] was named [[Provveditore|''provveditore generale'']] and general [[Auguste de Marmont]] was named military commander of Dalmatia.{{Sfn|Novak|1965|pp=39–40}}

In 1809, after a brief war with France, [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] ceded Carinthia, Carniola, Croatia west of the Sava River, Gorizia and Trieste to France. These territories, along with Dalmatia, formed the [[Illyrian Provinces]]. During this period, large investments were undertaken in the city, new streets were built and parts of the ancient fortifications were removed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/balkans/illprov.html |title=WHKMLA : History of the Illyrian Provinces, 1797–1815 |website=www.zum.de |access-date=10 November 2007 |archive-date=19 December 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219190144/http://www.zum.de/whkmla/region/balkans/illprov.html |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Sfn|Novak|1965|pp=47–48}}

===Under Habsburg rule===
[[File:Split Croatia 19th century.jpg|thumb|The ''Riva'' of Split in the 19th century, with [[Marjan hill]] in the background.]]
[[File:SPLIT-Overall view 1910.jpg|thumb|City center and the ''Riva'' promenade from the slopes of Marjan in 1910.]]

The Split region became part of the [[Kingdom of Dalmatia]], a separate administrative unit. After the [[revolutions of 1848]] as a result of the [[romantic nationalism]], two factions appeared. One was the pro-Croatian ''Unionist faction'' (later called the ''"Puntari"'', "Pointers"), led by the [[People's Party (Kingdom of Dalmatia)|People's Party]] and, to a lesser extent, the [[Party of Rights (Kingdom of Dalmatia)|Party of Rights]], both of which advocated the union of Dalmatia with the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] which was under Hungarian administration. This faction was strongest in Split, and used it as its headquarters. The other faction was the pro-Italian [[Autonomist Party|Autonomist]] faction (also known as the "[[Italia irredenta|Irredentist]]" faction), whose political goals varied from autonomy within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], to a political union with the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Kingdom of Italy]].

The political alliances in Split shifted over time. At first, the Unionists and Autonomists were allied against the [[centralism]] of [[Vienna]]. After a while, when the national question came to prominence, they separated. Under Austria, Split generally stagnated. The great upheavals in Europe in 1848 gained no ground here, and the city did not rebel.

[[Antonio Bajamonti]] became Mayor of Split in 1860 and – except for a brief interruption during the period 1864–65 – held the post for over two decades until 1880. Bajamonti was also a member of the [[Dalmatian Sabor]] (1861–91) and the [[Abgeordnetenhaus (Austria)|Austrian Chamber of Deputies]] (1867–70 and 1873–79). In 1882 Bajamonti's party lost the elections and [[Dujam Rendić-Miočević]], a prominent city lawyer, was elected to the post.

===As part of Yugoslavia===

====Kingdom of Yugoslavia====

After the end of [[World War I]] and the dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]], the province of [[Dalmatia]], along with Split, became a part of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. Split was the site of [[1918–1920 incidents in Split|a series of incidents between 1918 and 1920]].
Since [[Rijeka]], [[Trieste]] and [[Zadar]], the three other large cities on the eastern Adriatic coast, were annexed by [[Italy]], Split became the most important port in the Kingdom. The [[Croatian Railways|Lika railway]], connecting Split to the rest of the country, was completed in 1925.
The country changed its name to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, and the [[Port of Split]] became the seat of new administrative unit, [[Littoral Banovina]]. After the [[Cvetković-Maček agreement]], Split became the part of new administrative unit (merging of Sava and Littoral Banovina plus some Croat populated areas), [[Banovina of Croatia]] in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia.

====World War II====

In April 1941, following the [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] by [[Nazi Germany]], Split was occupied by Italy. Although Split formally became part of the [[Independent State of Croatia]], the [[Ustaše]] were not able to establish and strengthen their rule in Split, as Italians assumed all power in Dalmatia. One month later, on 18 May 1941, when the [[Treaties of Rome (1941)|Treaties of Rome]] were signed, Italy formally annexed Split, which was included in the [[province of Spalato]], and large parts of Dalmatia down to [[Kotor]].<ref name="Nikola Anić 1943. p. 12">Nikola Anić: Povijest Osmog dalmatinskog korpusa Narodnooslobodilačke vojske Hrvatske : 1943.-1945., p. 12</ref><ref>{{cite book |first1=Francesca Ferratini |last1=Tosi |first2=Gaetano |last2=Grassi |first3=Massimo |last3=Legnani |title=L'Italia nella seconda guerra mondiale e nella resistenza |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bqJoAAAAMAAJ |year=1988 |publisher=Franco Angeli |isbn=9788820423780 |access-date=31 October 2017 |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803162952/https://books.google.com/books?id=bqJoAAAAMAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> The Italian [[Governatorate of Dalmatia]] hosted 390,000 inhabitants, of which 280,000 Croats, 90,000 Serbs and 5,000 [[Dalmatian Italians]].<ref name=":0">{{cite book |first=Alberto |last=Becherelli |title=Italia e stato indipendente croato, 1941-1943 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym3dzlSfZUUC |year=2012 |publisher=Edizioni Nuova Cultura |page=90 |isbn=978-88-6134-780-9 |access-date=31 October 2017 |archive-date=20 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820030822/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ym3dzlSfZUUC |url-status=live }}</ref> 
Italian rule met heavy opposition from the Croat population as Split became a centre of anti-fascist sentiment in Yugoslavia. The first armed resistance group was organized on 7 May 1941 and the 63 member strong 1st Strike Detachment (''Prvi udarni odred'') served as the basis for future formations, including the [[1st Split Partisan Detachment]].<ref name=kronika1941>{{Cite book |url=http://www.ratnakronikasplita.com/kronika/1941 |title=1941. - Prva ratna godina |trans-title=1941. - The first war year |publisher=Udruga antifašističkih boraca i antifašista grada Splita |access-date=14 September 2014 |archive-date=23 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023071159/http://www.ratnakronikasplita.com/kronika/1941/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Between September and October 1941 alone, ten officials of the Italian fascist occupation were assassinated by the citizens.<ref name="The three Yugoslavias">Ramet, Sabrina P.; ''The three Yugoslavias: state-building and legitimation, 1918–2005''; [[Indiana University Press]], 2006 {{ISBN|0-253-34656-8}}</ref>

The local football clubs refused to compete in the Italian championship; [[HNK Hajduk Split|HNK Hajduk]] and [[RNK Split]] suspended their activities and both joined the Partisans along with their entire staff after the Italian capitulation provided the opportunity. Soon after Hajduk became the official football club of the Partisan movement.

In September 1943, following the capitulation of Italy,<ref name=":0" /> the city was temporarily controlled by Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s brigades with thousands of people volunteering to join the [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] of Tito (a third of the total population, according to some sources). Eight thousand Italian soldiers from the [[15th Infantry Division Bergamo]] prepared to fight alongside the Yugoslav Partisans against the [[Waffen SS]] [[7. SS-Freiwilligen-Gebirgs-Division "Prinz Eugen"|Prinz Eugen]]. Italian General Becuzzi handed over to the Partisans 11 soldiers which they considered as "war criminals".{{citation needed|date=June 2018}} The Partisans also executed up to 41 members of the Italian Police forces, later found in mass graves.<ref name=autogenerato9>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cadutipolizia.it/fonti/1925-1943/1943franco.htm |title=Franco Paolo<!-- Titolo generato automaticamente --> |access-date=31 October 2017 |archive-date=9 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309161512/http://www.cadutipolizia.it/fonti/1925-1943/1943franco.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Relevance inline|date=June 2018}}

A few weeks later, the Partisans were forced into retreat as the [[Wehrmacht]] placed the city under the authority of the [[Independent State of Croatia]]. The Germans decimated the Italian soldiers as traitors, including three Generals (Policardi, [[Salvatore Pelligra|Pelligra]] and [[Alfonso Cigala Fulgosi|Cigala Fulgosi]]) and 48 officials (Trelj massacre).<ref name=autogenerato3>''Vita e morte del soldato italiano nella guerra senza fortuna'' - Ed. Ferni Ginevra 1971 Vol. XII</ref> In this period the last remaining symbols of Italian heritage in Split, including several Venetian [[Lion of Saint Mark|Lions of St. Mark]], were erased from the town.

In a tragic turn of events, besides being bombed by Axis forces, the city was also bombed by the Allies, causing hundreds of deaths. Partisans finally captured the city on 26 October 1944 and instituted it as the provisional capital of Croatia. On 12 February 1945, the [[Kriegsmarine]] conducted a daring raid on the Split harbour, damaging the British cruiser ''[[HMS Delhi (D47)|Delhi]]''. After the war the remaining members of [[Dalmatian Italians]] of Split left Yugoslavia towards Italy ([[Istrian-Dalmatian exodus]]).<ref>{{cite book |author=E. White and J.

====Federal Yugoslavia====

After World War II, Split became a part of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]], itself a constituent sovereign republic of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. During the period the city experienced its largest economic and demographic boom. Dozens of new factories and companies were founded with the city population tripling during the period. The city became the economic centre of an area exceeding the borders of Croatia and was flooded by waves of rural migrants from the undeveloped hinterland who found employment in the newly established industry, as part of large-scale [[industrialization]] and investment by the Yugoslav Federal Government.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

The shipbuilding industry was particularly successful and Yugoslavia, with its [[SR Croatia|Croatian]] shipyards, became one of the world's top nations in the field. Many recreational facilities were also constructed with federal funding, especially for the [[1979 Mediterranean Games]], such as the [[Poljud Stadium]]. The city also became the largest passenger and military port in Yugoslavia, housing the headquarters of the [[SFR Yugoslav Navy|Yugoslav Navy]] (''Jugoslavenska ratna mornarica,'' JRM) and the [[Yugoslav People's Army|Army's]] Coastal Military District (equivalent of a [[field army]]). In the period between 1945 and 1990, the city was transformed and expanded, taking up the vast majority of the Split [[peninsula]]. In the same period it achieved an as yet unsurpassed GDP and employment level, still above the present day's, growing into a significant Yugoslav city.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Since independence===
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}

When Croatia declared its independence again in 1991, Split had a large garrison of [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) troops (drafted from all over Yugoslavia), as well as the headquarters and facilities of the [[Yugoslav Navy]] (JRM). This led to a tense months-long stand-off between the JNA and Croatian National Guard and police forces, occasionally flaring up in various incidents. The most tragic incident occurred on 15 November 1991, when the [[Yugoslav frigate Split|JRM light frigate ''Split'']] fired a small number of shells at the city and its surroundings. The damage was insignificant but there were a few casualties. Three general locations were bombarded: the old city center, the city airport, and an uninhabited part of the hills above [[Kaštela]], between the airport and Split. JRM sailors, most of them Croats themselves, who had refused to attack Croat civilians were left in the vessel's brig. The JNA and JRM evacuated all of its facilities in Split during January 1992. The 1990s economic recession soon followed.

In the years following 2000, Split finally gained momentum and started to develop again, with a focus on tourism. From being just a transport centre, Split is now a major Croatian tourist destination. Many new hotels are being built, as well as new apartment and office buildings. Many large development projects are being revived, and new infrastructure is being built. An example of one of the latest large city projects is the [[Spaladium Arena]], built in 2009.

==Geography==
{{wide image|Harbour, Split (P1080940-Pano).jpg |800px|Panorama view of Split's waterfront (Riva) and surroundings}}
Split is situated on a [[peninsula]] between the eastern part of the [[Gulf of Kaštela]] and the [[Split Channel]]. The [[Marjan hill]] ({{cvt|178|m}}), rises in the western part of the peninsula. The [[Mali Kozjak|Kozjak]] ({{cvt|779|m}}) and [[Mosor]] ({{cvt|1339|m}}) ridges protect the city from the north and northeast, and separate it from the hinterland.

Split is administratively divided into 34 city [[kotar (subdivision)|kotar]]s:<ref>[http://clgis.split.hr/gis_splita/geo_data/pdf/GradskiKotari.pdf GIS Grada Splita] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313234009/http://clgis.split.hr/gis_splita/geo_data/pdf/GradskiKotari.pdf |date=13 March 2012 }} Gradski kotari</ref><ref>[http://www.split.hr/lgs.axd?t=16&id=15809 ''Službeni glasnik Grada Splita'', number 18/2016], 13 April 2016.</ref>

==Climate==
Split has a [[Mediterranean climate|Hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'') in the [https://www.koppen-map.com/ Köppen climate classification]. It experiences hot, moderately dry summers and mild, wet winters, which can occasionally feel cold, because of a strong northern wind, termed [[Bora (wind)|''bura'']].

January is the coldest month, with an average low temperature around {{cvt|6|°C|0}}. July is the hottest month, with an average high temperature around {{cvt|31|°C|0}}.

===Inhabitants===
[[File:Valerio - Paysan Morlaques des environs de Spalato, 1864.jpg|thumb|right|150px|A "[[Morlach]]" (Vlaj) peasant in Split, 1864.]]
Although the inhabitants of Split (''Splićani'') may appear to be a homogeneous body, they traditionally belong to three groups. The old urban families, the ''Fetivi,'' (short for "''Fetivi Splićani''", "real Split natives") are generally very proud of their city, its history and its distinctive traditional speech<ref name="Terras">{{Cite book |first1=Henrik |last1=Birnbaum |first2=Victor |last2=Terras |title=International Congress of Slavists, 8 |publisher=Slavica Publishers |year=1978 |page=472 |isbn=0-89357-046-X}}</ref> (a variant of the [[Chakavian]] dialect). The ''Fetivi,'' now a distinct minority, are sometimes referred to (semi-derogatorily) as "''Mandrili''" - and are augmented by the so-called ''Boduli,'' immigrants from the nearby [[Adriatic islands]] who mostly arrived over the course of the 20th century.<ref name="Bousfield">{{Cite book |first=Jonathan |last=Bousfield |title=The Rough Guide to Croatia |publisher=Rough Guides |year=2003 |page=293 |isbn=1-84353-084-8}}</ref>

The above two groups are distinct, in the [[Mediterranean culture|Mediterranean aspects]] of their ethnicity and traditional Chakavian speech, from the more numerous [[Shtokavian]]-speaking immigrants from the rural [[Zagora (Croatia)|Zagora]] hinterland, referred to as the ''[[Vlaji]]'' (a term that sometimes carries negative connotations). The latter joined the Fetivi and Boduli as a third group in the decades since World War II, thronging the high-rise suburbs that stretch away from the centre.<ref name="Bousfield" /> By now the ''Vlaji'' constitute a decided majority of inhabitants, causing a distinct shift in the overall ethnic characteristics of the city. Historically more influenced by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Culture of the Ottoman Empire|culture]], their population merges almost seamlessly at the eastern border with the [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Herzegovinian Croats]] and southern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in general.<ref name="Terras" /><ref name="Bousfield" /> Local jokes have always condemned the Vlaji to playing the role of rural unsophisticates, although it is often conceded that it was their hard work in the industries of the post-WWII era that made modern-day Split what it is now.<ref name="Bousfield" />

==Economy==
{{See also|Economy of Croatia|Croatian privatization controversy}}

[[File:Brodosplit - juice carrier.JPG|thumb|220px|left|Juice carrier sitting on a slipway at [[Brodosplit]]]]

Split's economy is still suffering the backlash from the [[recession]] caused by the transfer to a [[market economy]] and [[privatization]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In the Yugoslav era, the city had been a highly significant economic centre with a modern and diverse industrial and economic base, including [[shipbuilding]], [[food industry|food]], [[chemical industry|chemical]], [[plastics industry|plastics]], [[textile industry|textile]], and [[paper industry]], in addition to large revenues from tourism.{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} In 1981 Split's GDP per capita was 37% above the Yugoslav average.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Atlas svijeta: Novi pogled na Zemlju |year=1984 |edition=3rd |publisher=Sveučilišna naklada Liber |location=Zagreb |language=hr |editor1-first=Radovan |editor1-last=Radovinović |editor2-first=Ivan |editor2-last=Bertić}}</ref> Today, most of the factories are out of business (or are far below pre-war production and employment capacity){{Citation needed|date=November 2014}} and the city has been trying to concentrate on commerce and services, consequently leaving an alarmingly large number of factory workers unemployed.

[[File:Westgate Tower B (Dalmatia Tower) night view.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Dalmatia Tower]], the tallest skyscraper in Croatia.]]

[[Brodosplit]] is the largest shipyard in Croatia. It employs around 2,300 people, and has built over 350 vessels, including many tankers, both panamax and non-panamax, as well as container ships, bulk carriers, dredgers, off-shore platforms, frigates, submarines, patrol boats and passenger ships. 80% of the ships built are exported to foreign contractors.

The new A1 motorway, integrating Split with the rest of the Croatian freeway network, has helped stimulate economic production and investment, with new businesses being built in the city centre and its wildly sprawling suburbs. The entire route was opened in July 2005. Today, the city's economy relies mostly on [[trade]] and [[tourism]] with some old industries undergoing partial revival, such as food ([[fishing]], [[olive]], [[wine]] production), paper, [[concrete]] and chemicals. Since 1998, Split has been host to the annual [[Croatia Boat Show]].

==Education==

There are 24 primary schools and 23 secondary schools including 11 grammar schools.

===University===

[[File:Split University Library-wide.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Split University Library]]

{{Main|University of Split}}
{{further|List of universities in Croatia}}

The University of Split ({{lang-hr|Sveučilište u Splitu}}) was founded in 1974. In the last few years it has grown to a large extent. Now it has 18,000 students and is organized in 12 faculties and 1 Academy (Arts Academy – Theatre department, Music department, Fine arts department and design). Split has the biggest university campus in Croatia with all the facilities. It houses all of the faculties, a large student centre with a sports hall, sporting grounds and a university library.

==Culture==
[[File:HR21000 Radisson Blu 03-1024x576.webp|thumb|left|250px|[[Radisson Blu]] Resort & Hotel in Split]]
In 1979, the historic center of Split was included into the [[UNESCO]] list of [[World Heritage Site]]s. Split is said to be one of the centres of Croatian culture. Its literary tradition can be traced to medieval times and includes names like [[Marko Marulić]], while in more modern times more authors have a sense of humor.

Among the most notable are [[Miljenko Smoje]], with his TV series ''Malo misto'' and ''Velo misto'' (the latter covering Split's modernization), and [[Ivo Tijardović]], who wrote an operetta called "[[Little Floramye]]" ({{lang-hr|Mala Floramye}}). Both represented to some the old traditions slowly dying out due to large numbers of rural migrants from the undeveloped hinterland.

Despite colorful settings and characters, as well as a cinema tradition beginning with early 20th-century works of [[Josip Karaman]], there were relatively few films shot in or around Split. Its most notable star is [[Boris Dvornik]].

[[Sportsperson|Sportsmen]] are traditionally held in high regard in Split, which has produced many champions. The most popular sports in Split are [[association football]], [[tennis]], [[basketball]], [[swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[sailing]], [[waterpolo]], [[Athletics (sport)|athletics]], and [[handball]]. Residents of Split prefer to call their city as "the sportiest city in the world".
The main football [[football club|club]] is [[HNK Hajduk Split]], one of the most popular clubs in Croatia supported by a large fan association known as [[Torcida Split]], while [[RNK Split]] is the city's second club. Torcida Split is the oldest fan group in Europe estimated 1950. The largest football stadium is the [[Poljud Stadium]] (Hajduk's ground), with around 35,000 capacity (55,000 prior to the renovation to an all-seater). [[Slaven Bilić]], [[Aljoša Asanović]], [[Igor Tudor]], [[Robert Jarni]], and [[Stipe Pletikosa]] are some of the natives who started their careers at Hajduk. [[Basketball]] is also popular, and the city basketball club, [[KK Split]], holds the record of winning the [[EuroLeague]] three consecutive times (1989–1991), with notable players like [[Toni Kukoč]] and [[Dino Rađa]], both of whom are Split natives.

Former [[WWE]] wrestler and [[WWE Hall of Fame]] member Josip Peruzović, better known as [[Nikolai Volkoff]], was born in Split.

Split's notable tennis players are the retired 2001 [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] champion [[Goran Ivanišević]], [[Mario Ančić]] (''Super Mario''), [[Nikola Pilić]] and [[Željko Franulović]]. [[Marina Eraković]] was also born in Split.

Members of the local rowing club [[HVK Gusar]] won numerous [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[World Rowing Championships|World Championship]] medals.

Swimming also has a long tradition in Split, with [[Đurđica Bjedov]] (1968 Olympic gold medal and Olympic record in the 100&nbsp;m breaststroke), [[Duje Draganja]] and [[Vanja Rogulj]] as the city's top swimmers. As a member of the ASK Split athletics club, the champion [[Blanka Vlašić]] also originates from the city. The biggest sports events to be held in Split were the [[1979 Mediterranean Games]], and the [[1990 European Athletics Championships]].

Split was one of the host cities of the [[2009 World Men's Handball Championship]]. The city constructed a new sporting arena for the event, the [[Spaladium Arena]]. Its capacity is around 12,000 spectators (in basketball events). The cost of the arena was evenly divided between the city and the government.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=68630 |title=Cabinet And Split Participate in Financing Hall |date=6 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090115200850/http://www.javno.com/en/croatia/clanak.php?id=68630 |archive-date=15 January 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Ivano Balić]], two-time [[IHF World Player of the Year]] was Split's best handball player.

Split used to be the home to three top-level water polo clubs, the winners of many domestic and international titles: [[VK Jadran Split|Jadran]] (twice [[LEN Champions League]] winner), [[VK Mornar|Mornar]] ([[LEN Cup Winners' Cup]] winner) and now defunct [[POŠK]] (one LEN Champions League, one [[LEN Super Cup]] and two times LEN Cup Winners' Cup winner). Many players from Split have participated at the Olympic Games, [[Water polo at the World Aquatics Championships|World]], and [[European Water Polo Championship|European Championships]], both for Croatia and Yugoslavia, having won several medals. Several water polo players from Split have been considered the best in the world during their careers: [[Ratko Rudić]], Damir Polić, [[Milivoj Bebić]], and [[Deni Lušić]].

[[Picigin]] is a traditional local sport (originating in 1908), played on the sandy Bačvice beach. It is played in very shallow water (just ankle-deep) with a small ball. Picigin is played by five players. The ball is the peeled tennis ball. There is a tradition of playing picigin in Split on New Year's Day, regardless of the weather conditions, in spite of the sea temperature rarely exceeding {{cvt|15|°C}}.

[[RK Nada]] were the pioneers of [[rugby union]] in this part of the World. They were by far the strongest club in the former Yugoslavia and they are also by far the most successful club in modern-day Croatia.

[[Baseball]] in Split is one of the city's longest sporting traditions. Although the sport began semi-officially in December 1918 when a group of US sailors from a ship in port introduced the game to some young Croats, it was not until 1972 when a pair of teachers at a local school formed the Salona Baseball Club, named after the ancient Roman city of [[Salona]]. The first actual game played in Split was on 9 September 1978 between Split (the new team moved here and was called Nada) and Jezice from Ljubljana, a 20–1 romp for the locals. A schedule of games began in earnest and by 1980 there were regular league games. The next major milestone was in 1983 when the World Baseball Federation (IBAF){{clarify|date=March 2017|reason=International Baseball Federation?}} accepted Yugoslavia as an official member. The Croatian National Baseball Federation was established in 1989.

Today, the Croatian national baseball team (with 10 or more members coming from Split's Nada team) is ranked 25th in the world. Split's team, Nada, plays its home games at the old Hajduk stadium, where the rugby club also plays. Without a mound, it is not a regulation field. The team's main rival is Zagreb and there are teams from half a dozen other cities around the country. In addition to playing other Croatian teams, inter-league games are played and the team travels to Belgrade and other cities to play. Although not a professional team or league, some player/coaches are paid. Several have pro experience and the new coach of the national team was a former major league pitcher with the LA Dodgers. The source material here is from Mladen Cukrov's book ''There's No Ball Like Baseball'' (''Nima baluna do bejzbola'') and from the writer's experience as an assistant coach of the team for several years.

The Split SeaWolves club is the only [[American football]] team in Dalmatia. Active from 2008, they are currently still developing and the main focus is on a flag football team.

Split is an important transport center for [[Dalmatia]] and the wider region. In addition to the [[Zagreb]]-Split freeway ([[A1 (Croatia)|A1]]), the traffic along the Adriatic coast on the [[Adriatic Highway]] from [[Rijeka]] to [[Dubrovnik]] flows through the city. The local public transport company [[Promet Split]] runs bus lines in the city and into the surroundings. There is no [[tram]] since the city is unsuitable for it due to its hilly geography.

The [[Split Airport]] in [[Kaštela]], located about 20&nbsp;km outside of Split, is the second largest in Croatia in terms of passenger numbers (2.89 million in 2021).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Split Airport Facts & Figures |url=https://splitairport.net/statistics/ |access-date=2023-12-03 |website=Split Airport |language=en-GB}}</ref> It has services to national and some European destinations year-round and sees lots of additional seasonal connections in the summer.

The [[Port of Split]], which serves 4 million passengers every year,<ref>{{Cite web |last=ladmin |title=Statistike |url=https://portsplit.hr/luka-split/statistike/ |access-date=2023-12-19 |website=Lučka uprava Split |language=hr}}</ref> is the third busiest port in the [[Mediterranean]]. It connects Split to the nearby central Dalmatian islands [[Brač]], [[Hvar]] and [[Šolta]], as well as the more distant [[Vis (island)|Vis]], [[Korčula]], [[Mljet]] and [[Lastovo]]. There are also routes to [[Rijeka]], [[Dubrovnik]], and [[Ancona]] in Italy and additional seasonal routes to further destinations in Italy. Split is also becoming a major [[cruise ship]] destination, with over 260 ship visits, carrying 130,000 passengers.

Split has a railway station located in the city center just near the main port (in the souther part of the peninsula), which serves as a terminus for [[Croatian Railways|Croatian Railways']] long-distance [[Limited-stop|limited-stop service]] trains (which run between Split and country's capital city [[Zagreb]]) and commuter trains which run between Split and [[Kaštel Stari]] as a part of [[Split Suburban Railway]]. There are also summer-seasonal limited-stop overnight trains between Split and [[Osijek]]/[[Vukovar]] (passenger service provided by Croatian Railways), [[Budapest]] (passenger service provided by [[Hungarian State Railways|MAV]]), [[Vienna]]/[[Bratislava]] (passenger service provided by [[ÖBB]] AND [[Železničná spoločnosť Slovensko|ŽSSK]]).<ref>{{Cite web |last=Telegram.hr |title=Prvi direktan vlak iz Osijeka do Splita kasnio 83 minute |url=https://www.telegram.hr/zivot/hz-nije-razocarao-prvi-direktan-vlak-iz-osijeka-do-splita-kasnio-83-minute/ |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=Telegram.hr |language=hr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Croatia |url=https://www.nightjet.com/en/reiseziele/kroatien |access-date=2023-03-10 |website=Nightjet |language=en}}</ref> Other than the terminus station, the city has one additional train station "Split Predgrađe" (lit.
