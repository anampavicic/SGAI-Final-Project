'''Markham''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑːr|k|ə|m}}) is a city in [[Regional Municipality of York|York Region]], [[Ontario]], Canada. It is approximately {{cvt|30|km}} northeast of [[Downtown Toronto]]. In the [[Canada 2021 Census|2021 Census]], Markham had a population of 338,503,<ref name="2021census"/> which ranked it the largest in York Region, fourth largest in the [[Greater Toronto Area]] (GTA), and [[List of the largest municipalities in Canada by population|16th largest]] in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2015/07/24/why-markham-is-the-next-highrise-community.html|title=Why Markham is the next highrise community|last=Tuckey|first=Bryan|newspaper=[[Toronto Star]]|date=24 July 2015|access-date=12 April 2016|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304123549/http://www.thestar.com/life/homes/2015/07/24/why-markham-is-the-next-highrise-community.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 1971 Markham was incorporated as a town, as its population skyrocketed due to [[urban sprawl]] from Toronto. In 1976 Markham's population was approximately 56,000. Since that time, the population has more than quintupled, with explosive growth in new subdivisions. Much of Markham's [[arable land|farmland]] has disappeared, but some still remains north of [[York Regional Road 25|Major Mackenzie Drive]]. Controversy over the development of the environmentally-sensitive [[Oak Ridges Moraine]] will likely{{original research inline|date=November 2019}} curb development north of Major Mackenzie Drive and by [[Rouge National Urban Park]] east of Reesor Road between Major Mackenzie Drive to Steeles Avenue East to the south.

Since the 1980s Markham has been recognized{{by whom|date=November 2019}} as a suburb of Toronto. {{As of | 2006}} the city comprises six major communities: [[Berczy Village, Ontario|Berczy Village]], [[Cornell, Ontario|Cornell]], Markham Village, [[Milliken, Ontario|Milliken]], Thornhill and Unionville. Many high-tech companies have established [[head office]]s in Markham, attracted by the relative abundance of land, low tax-rates and good transportation routes. [[Broadcom]] Canada, ATI Technologies (now known as AMD Graphics Product Group), [[IBM Canada Head Office Building|IBM Canada]], Motorola Canada, Honeywell Canada and many other well-known companies have chosen Markham as their home in Canada. The city has accordingly started branding itself as Canada's "High-Tech Capital". The province of Ontario has erected a historical plaque in front of the [[Markham Museum]] to commemorate the founding of Markham's role{{clarify|date=November 2019}} in Ontario's heritage.<ref>{{cite web

Town council voted on May 29, 2012, to change Markham's legal designation from "town" to "city"; according to Councillor Alex Chiu, who introduced the motion, the change of designation merely reflects the fact that many people already think of Markham as a city.<ref name=city /> Some residents objected to the change because it will involve unknown costs without any demonstrated benefits. The designation officially took effect on July 1.<ref name=city />

==Geography==

Markham covers {{cvt|212.47|km2}} and Markham's city centre is at {{Coord|43|53|N|79|15|W|type:lanmark_region:CA-ON|name=Markham city centre}}. It is bounded by five municipalities; in the west is [[Vaughan]] with the boundary along Yonge Street between [[Steeles Avenue]] and [[York Regional Road 7|Highway 7]] and [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|Richmond Hill]] with the boundary along Highway 7 from Yonge Street to [[Ontario Highway 404|Highway 404]] and at Highway 404 from Highway 7 to 19th Avenue and [[York Regional Road 14|Stouffville Road]]. In the south, it borders Toronto with the boundary along Steeles Avenue. In the north it borders [[Whitchurch–Stouffville]] with the boundary from Highway 404 to York-Durham Line between 19th Avenue and Stouffville Road. In the east it borders [[Pickering, Ontario|Pickering]] along York-Durham Line.

===Topography===
Markham's average altitude is at {{cvt|200|m}} and in general consists of gently rolling hills. The city is intersected by two rivers; the [[Don River (Ontario)|Don River]] and [[Rouge River (Ontario)|Rouge River]], as well as their tributaries. To the north is the Oak Ridges Moraine, which further elevates the elevation towards the north.

===Climate===

Markham borders and shares the same [[Geography of Toronto#Climate|climate as Toronto]]. On an average day, Markham is generally {{cvt|1|-|2|C-change}} cooler than in [[downtown Toronto]]. It has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfb'') and features warm, humid summers with rainfall occurring from May to October and cold, snowy winters. The highest temperature recorded was {{cvt|37.8|C}} on August 8, 2001, during the [[2001 Eastern North America heat wave|eastern North America heat wave]] and the lowest temperature recorded was {{cvt|−35.2|C}} on January 16, 1994, during the [[1994 North American cold wave]].<ref name="ccnmarkham"/>

Thornhill and Unionville are popularly seen as being separate communities. Thornhill straddles the Markham-Vaughan municipal boundary (portions of it in both municipalities). Unionville is a single community with three sub-communities:
* Original Unionville is along Highway 7 and Kennedy Road
* South Unionville is a newer residential community (beginning from the 1990s onwards) south of Highway 7 to Highway 407 and from McCowan to Kennedy Road
* Upper Unionville is a new residential development built on the northeast corner of 16th Avenue and Kennedy Road

==Government==
{{See also|List of mayors of Markham, Ontario}}

===City Council===
[[Markham City Council]] consists of [[Frank Scarpitti]] as mayor, four regional councillors and eight ward councillors each representing one of the city's eight wards. Scarpitti replaced [[Don Cousens]], a former [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|MPP]] for [[Markham (federal electoral district)|Markham]] and a [[Presbyterian Church in Canada|Presbyterian]] church minister. The community elects the mayor and four regional councillors to represent the City of Markham at the regional level. The municipality pays the Councillors for their services, but in many municipalities, members of council usually serve part-time and work at other jobs. Residents elected the current members of council to a four-year term of office, in accordance with standards set by the province. The selection of members for the offices of mayor and regional councillors are made town-wide, while ward councillors are elected by individual ward.

===Markham Civic Centre===
[[File:MarkhamCivicCenter25.jpg|thumb|Markham Civic Centre]]
The city council is at the [[Markham Civic Centre]] at the intersection of York Regional Road 7 and [[York Regional Road 65|Warden Avenue]]. The site of the previous offices on [[Woodbine Avenue (Ontario)|Woodbine Avenue]] has been redeveloped for commercial uses. The historic town hall on [[Markham Road|Main Street]] is now a restored office building. The Mayor's Youth Task Force was created to discuss issues facing young people in the city and to plan and publicize events. Its primary purpose is to encourage youth participation within the community.

===Elections===
Municipal elections are held every four years in Ontario. The most recent election took place in October, 2022, and the next is scheduled for October, 2026. The links listed below provide the results of recent election results:

* [[2006 Markham municipal election|2006]]

===By-laws===
The city is permitted to create and enforce by-laws upon residents on various matters affecting the town. The by-laws are generally enforced by City By-Law enforcement officers, but they may involve [[York Regional Police]] if violations are deemed too dangerous for the officers to handle. In addition the by-laws can be linked to various provincial acts and enforced by the town. Violation of by-laws is subject to fines of up to $20,000 CAD. The by-laws of Markham include:

==Economy==
[[File:AMD50Markham.jpg|thumb|Markham mayor Frank Scarpitti at the AMD Markham campus during the AMD 50th Anniversary celebration.]]
In the 19th century Markham had a vibrant, independent community with mills, distilleries and breweries around the intersection of Highway 7 and Markham Road. The [[Thomas Speight Wagon Works]] exported products (wagons, horsecars) around the world, and Markham had a reputation as being more active than York (the former name for Toronto) early on. Most of these industries disappeared leaving farming as the main source of business.

Light industries and businesses began to move into Markham in the 1980s attracted by land and lower taxes.

===Roads===
{{Main|List of regional roads in York Region, Ontario}}

==== Road network ====
Markham's road network is based on the concession system. In 1801, Markham was divided into 10 [[Concession road|concessions]], with a north–south road separating each one. The concessions were further divided by a number of east–west sideroads. This formed a [[grid plan]] road network, with an intersection occurring approximately every two kilometers. Even though some of these roads have been realigned, Markham's present road network for the most part still follows the original grid plan.

Markham's concession (north–south) arterial roads are listed below, ordered from west to east (former numbers in parentheses):

* {{jcon|York|1|notext=y}} [[Yonge Street]]
** Boundary with the City of Vaughan
* {{jcon|York|34|notext=y}} [[Bayview Avenue]]
* {{jcon|York|12|notext=y}} Leslie Street
* {{jcon|York|8|notext=y}} [[Woodbine Avenue]]
* {{jcon|York|65|notext=y}} Warden Avenue (5th Concession Road)
* {{jcon|York|3|notext=y}} Kennedy Road (6th Concession Road)
* {{jcon|York|67|notext=y}} McCowan Road (7th Concession Road)
* {{jcon|York|68|notext=y}} Markham Road (8th Concession Road)
** Continues as {{jcon|hwy|48|shield=y|notext=y}} [[Ontario Highway 48|Highway 48]] north of Major Mackenzie Drive
* {{jcon|York|69|notext=y}} Ninth Line (9th Concession Road)
* {{jcon|York|48|notext=y}} [[Donald Cousens Parkway|Donald Cousens Parkway / Markham By-pass]]
** Signed as a regular road south of Box Grove By-pass
* Reesor Road (10th Concession Road)
* Eleventh Line (11th Concession Road)
* {{jcon|York|30|notext=y}} York-Durham Line
** Boundary with the [[Pickering, Ontario|City of Pickering]]

Reesor Road and Eleventh Line are the only north–south roads that are not fully regional roads. These two roads are rural routes with very few homes and minimal traffic. Eleventh Line ends just south of Highway 407 with the road rerouted (old section fenced off with partial gravel bed) to intersect with York-Durham Line. Areas east of Donald Cousens Boulevard either serve new residential developments or are largely rural and/or agricultural.

Markham's sideroad (east–west) arterials are listed below, ordered from south to north (former numbers in parentheses):

* [[Steeles Avenue]]
** Original Scarborough Townline, boundary with the [[Toronto|City of Toronto]]
* {{jcon|York|71|notext=y}} 14th Avenue
** Continues west of {{jcon|York|65|notext=y}} Warden Avenue as Alden Road
*** Continues west of Rodick Road as Esna Park Drive
**** Continues west of {{jcon|York|8|notext=y}} Woodbine Avenue as John Street
* {{jcon|York|7|notext=y}} Regional Road 7 (formerly 15th Avenue)
** Continues as {{jcon|hwy|7|shield=y|notext=y}} [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]] east of Reesor Road
* {{jcon|York|73|notext=y}} 16th Avenue
* {{jcon|York|25|notext=y}} Major Mackenzie Drive East (17th Avenue)
* {{jcon|York|49|notext=y}} Elgin Mills Road East (18th Avenue)
** Signed as a standard road east of Victoria Square Boulevard
* 19th Avenue
** Boundary with the [[Whitchurch-Stouffville|Town of Whitchurch-Stouffville]]

==== Important thoroughfares ====
Major highways that pass through Markham include [[Ontario Highway 404|King's Highway 404]] (from Toronto to just south of Lake Simcoe), which marks Markham's boundary with the [[Richmond Hill, Ontario|City of Richmond Hill]], and the [[407 ETR]] (more commonly known as Highway 407), a privately owned [[Toll road|toll highway]] that passes north of Toronto and connects Markham with [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]] and [[Oshawa]]. Highway 404 is one of the most important routes used for travel to and from the City of Toronto. Highway 407 primarily serves Markham from [[Yonge Street]] to [[York-Durham Line]]. The highway connects Markham with [[Clarington]] to the east, and [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]] to the west.

One of the most heavily travelled arterial roads in Markham is Regional Road 7, a major east–west artery. This road is more commonly referred to as [[Ontario Highway 7|Highway 7]], a name which comes from the time when it used to be a [[Ontario Provincial Highway Network|provincial highway]]. The road is still officially Highway 7 east of Reesor Road. Other major east–west routes include [[York Regional Road 73|16th Avenue]], [[York Regional Road 25|Major MacKenzie Drive]], the combination of John Street/Esna Park Drive/14th Avenue, and [[Steeles Avenue]] which forms Markham's southern boundary with Toronto.

The [[GO Transit]] [[Stouffville line]], a [[commuter rail]] line stretching from [[Old Elm GO Station|Lincolnville]] to downtown Toronto, provides passenger rail service in Markham. It operates only at rush hour and uses tracks owned by [[Metrolinx]], the provincial transit agency. Five stations on the [[Stouffville line]] serve Markham, of which 4 are within the municipal borders. In 2015, Metrolinx announced that the Stouffville Line would get an expansion in service, bringing all day both directional trains from [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]] to [[Unionville GO Station]].<ref>{{Cite news|title = The new train service is expected to be in the off-peak hours.|url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2015/08/07/go-to-boost-train-service-on-kitchener-stouffville-lines.html|newspaper = The Toronto Star|date = 2015-08-07|access-date = 2015-11-20|issn = 0319-0781|first = Tess|last = Kalinowski|archive-date = 2015-11-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120161430/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2015/08/07/go-to-boost-train-service-on-kitchener-stouffville-lines.html|url-status = live}}</ref> Markham's section of this GO line also came under the spotlight in 2015 as [[Toronto|City of Toronto]] [[John Tory|Mayor John Tory's]] announced [[SmartTrack|SMART Track]] plan for rapid transit expansion in Toronto includes the rail spur between Union Station and the Unionville GO.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Kitchener and Stouffville GO lines are on track for electrification needed to boost service frequencies.|url = https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2015/04/16/premier-moves-torys-smarttrack-a-little-further-down-the-line.html|newspaper = The Toronto Star|date = 2015-04-16|access-date = 2015-11-20|issn = 0319-0781|first = Tess|last = Kalinowski|archive-date = 2015-11-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120160131/http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/transportation/2015/04/16/premier-moves-torys-smarttrack-a-little-further-down-the-line.html|url-status = live}}</ref>
