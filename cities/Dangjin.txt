'''Dangjin''' ({{Korean|hangul=당진}}; {{IPA|ko|taŋ.dʑin}}) is a city in [[South Chungcheong Province]], South Korea. It stands on the south shore of the [[Bay of Asan]]. Dangjin borders [[Incheon]], [[Pyeongtaek]], and [[Hwaseong City|Hwaseong]] by sea, and [[Seosan]], [[Yesan]], and [[Asan]] by land. Its name means "[[Tang dynasty|Tang]] ferry," and refers to the historic role of Dangjin's harbor in connecting Korea to the other side of the [[Yellow Sea]]. This role continues to be important in the city's economy, which relies on a mixture of agriculture and [[heavy industry]]. The city has the same Hanja name (唐津市) as [[Karatsu, Saga|Karatsu]] in Saga Prefecture, Japan.

==Administrative divisions==
{{See also|Administrative divisions of South Korea}}
The city is divided into 2 ''eup'', 9 ''myeon'' and 3 ''dong''.

==History==
The name "Dangjin" was first used to refer to this area during the [[Joseon Dynasty]]. From 1413 to 1895, it was known as Dangjin-hyeon, a division of [[Chungcheong]] Province. The city achieved its present borders in 1973, with the merger of a portion of Jeongmi-myeon into Seosan's Unsan-myeon. It was originally a county but was promoted to a city on January 1, 2012, after a rapid population boost.

Being on the Yellow Sea, the port has been important for trade with China, and since early times was defended against foreign invasion by becoming a fortress city ([[Eupseong]]). According to legend, the eupseong was built in the 16th year of [[Chungnyeol of Goryeo|King Chungyeol]] (1290 AD), but it is currently believed to have been built during the [[Baekje|Baekje period]] and modified throughout the [[Joseon|Joseon period]] to prevent foreign invasion. Mianchuan Eupseong is a city with four gates in the east, west, south, and north. It was rebuilt in the 13th year of [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong of the Joseon Dynasty]], and it was rebuilt during the reign of [[Gyeongjong of Joseon|King Gyeongjong]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=唐津沔川邑城(당진면천읍성) - 景點 - 韓國旅行和旅遊信息 |url=https://www.koreatriptips.com/zh-tw/tourist-attractions/2994629.html |access-date=2023-08-10 |website=www.koreatriptips.com |language=zh-tw}}</ref>
