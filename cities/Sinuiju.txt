'''Sinŭiju''' ({{korean|hangul=신의주시|mr=Sinŭiju-si}}; {{IPA|ko|ɕinɰidzu ɕi|IPA}}), is a city in [[North Korea]] which faces [[Dandong]], [[Liaoning]], [[China]], across the international border of the [[Yalu River]]. It is the capital of [[North Pyongan Province|North P'yŏngan province]]. Part of the city is included in the [[Sinuiju Special Administrative Region|Sinŭiju Special Administrative Region]], which was established in 2002 to experiment with introducing a market economy. In recent years, the city, despite lagging behind the development in the capital Pyongyang, has seen a small construction boom{{contradictory inline|date=April 2022}} and increasing tourism from China.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nknews.org/gallery/sights-of-sinuiju-change-and-continuity-in-north-koreas-window-to-china/|title = Sights of Sinuiju: Change and continuity in North Korea's window to China &#124; NK News}}</ref>

== History ==
Developed as a major settlement during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|colonial rule]] at the terminus of a railway bridge across the Amrok River, Sinuiju is located 11&nbsp;km (7 miles) south by southwest of [[Uiju|Ŭiju]], the old city from whose name Sinŭiju (meaning “New Ŭiju”) derives. As an open port, it grew commercially with the logging industry which uses the Amnok River to transport lumber. Additionally, a chemical industry developed after the hydroelectric Sup'ung Dam was built further up the river.

In the course of the [[Korean War]], after being driven from P'yŏngyang, Kim Il Sung and his government temporarily moved its capital to Sinŭiju<ref>{{cite book |last=Sandler |first=Stanley |date=1999 |title=The Korean War: No Victors, No Vanquished |url=https://archive.org/details/koreanwarnovicto0000sand |url-access=registration |publisher=The University Press of Kentucky |page=[https://archive.org/details/koreanwarnovicto0000sand/page/108 108]}}</ref><ref name=kanggye>{{cite book |last=Mossman |first=Billy |date=June 29, 2005 |title=United States Army in the Korean War: Ebb and Flow November 1950-July 1951 |publisher=University Press of the Pacific |page=51}}</ref> - although as UNC forces approached, the government again moved - this time to [[Kanggye]].<ref name=kanggye /> Also, the city sustained heavy damage from aerial bombardment as part of the [[United States Air Force]]'s [[Korean War#Bombing of North Korea|strategic bombing of North Korea]]; 95 percent of the city was destroyed.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/WZHtJG9UG7A Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20200104145925/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZHtJG9UG7A Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZHtJG9UG7A| title = Firebombing North Korea - The US and the Korean War | website=[[YouTube]]}}{{cbignore}}</ref> However, the city has since been rebuilt.

In 2018, a master plan for the redevelopment of the city was unveiled and shown to [[Kim Jong Un]], which would have featured many high rise buildings and parks, centered around the road leading to the statues of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. Ultimately, this plan has yet to be fulfilled, with the only major work completed being the repaving of roads leading to the statues and the red coloured, circular apartment building behind and the Sinuiju Youth Open Air Theatre's completion, although the industrial areas in the city have seen some reconstruction.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2021-03-08|title=Sinuiju City: Big Plans, Little Progress {{!}} 38 North: Informed Analysis of North Korea|url=https://www.38north.org/2021/03/sinuiju-city-big-plans-little-progress/|access-date=2021-03-14|website=38 North|language=en}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Waterfront at Sinuiji.jpg|thumb|left|Waterfront on the Amnok River]]
An important light industry centre in North Korea, Sinŭiju has a plant manufacturing enamelled ironware as well as a textile mill, paper mill and an afforestation factory. Its southwest harbour has a shipyard, although the shipyard's main function is seemingly to dismantle ships for scrap metal and other usable materials rather than building new ships. The area has recycling plants which recycle a wide range of material, including products that are banned for recycling in China.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rank|first=Michael|title=North Korean-Taiwan nuclear waste deal thwarted over export permit|url=http://www.nkeconwatch.com/|publisher=NK Economic Watch|access-date=19 March 2013|date=March 15, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Rank|first=Michael|title=North Korea in bid to recycle toxic waste|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3345854/North-Korea-in-bid-to-recycle-toxic-waste.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119225441/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/earthnews/3345854/North-Korea-in-bid-to-recycle-toxic-waste.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=19 January 2010|publisher=The Telegraph|access-date=19 March 2013|date=30 June 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dalian-based Huatai Recycling Resources Co Ltd|url=http://www.zz91.com/cn/productdetail159378.html|access-date=19 March 2013|language=zh}}</ref> The Sinŭiju Cosmetics Factory is located in South Sinŭiju (Namsinŭiju).

===Trade with China===
A substantial portion of North Korea's international trade, both legal and illegal, passes through Sinuiju and Dandong, across the [[Yalu River]].<ref name="NYT033116">{{cite news|author1=Jane Perlez and Yufan Huang|title=A Hole in North Korean Sanctions Big Enough for Coal, Oil and Used Pianos|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/01/world/asia/north-korea-china-sanctions-trade.html|access-date=April 3, 2016|work=The New York Times|date=March 31, 2016|quote=China accounts for about 90 percent of North Korea’s trade. Half of that business is estimated to flow through Dandong...}}</ref>

===Central market===
Since 2002, commercial life has been centred on the Chaeha-dong Market.<ref name="NK Eco Watch 3 April">{{cite web|title=Market expansion: Sinuiju|url=http://www.nkeconwatch.com/|publisher=North Korea Economic Watch|access-date=9 April 2013|date=3 April 2013}}</ref>  Based on a satellite image taken on 30 October 2012, the market has been destroyed and is being made into a new park.<ref name="NK Eco Watch 3 April"/>

==Transportation==
[[File:Sinuiju Railway Station DPRK.jpg|thumb|250px|Sinŭiju Ch'ŏngnyŏn Railway Station]]
Sinŭiju can be reached from [[Pyongyang|P'yŏngyang]] by air, railway and road. It can be reached from Dandong in China by crossing the Amnok River by bridge or boat. Foreign tourists on excursion boats from Dandong are sometimes permitted to approach within a few meters of the city's coastline, as long as they do not land.<ref>{{Cite web

===Rail===
[[Sinuiju Chongnyon Station|Sinŭiju Ch'ŏngnyŏn Station]] is the northern terminus of the [[Korean State Railway]]'s [[Pyongui Line|P'yŏngŭi Line]] from P'yŏngyang; the district is also served by several other stations on the P'yŏngŭi line, as well as the [[Tokhyon Line|Tŏkhyŏn]] and [[Paengma Line|Paengma lines]]. It is also connected with the Chinese city of [[Dandong]] in [[Liaoning]] Province (China) by the [[Sino-Korean Friendship Bridge]], which is {{convert|944|m|ft|abbr=on}} long from end to end, and through the [[Manchuria Railway]] links up with the [[Trans-Siberian railway]]. The factories of the city of Sinŭiju are provided with railway service via the [[Kangan Line|Kang'an Line]].

=== Urban transit ===
Sinuiju has a [[trolleybus]] line that runs from the city centre to the railway station. It was reopened in October 2020 with new trolleybuses derived from the Pyongyang Chollima-321 trolleybus. It formerly had another line running from the Sinuiju Chongnyon Station to Ragwon Machine Complex that closed between 2005 and 2009 with the reconstruction of the highway with a shifted alignment.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sinuiju|url=https://transphoto.org/city/1758/|access-date=2020-11-26|website=transphoto.org}}</ref>

== Climate ==
Sinŭiju has a monsoonal [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwa'') with hot, humid and stormy summers and cold, dry winters with little snowfall.
