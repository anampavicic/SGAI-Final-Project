'''Musoma''' is  a city in the east shore of Lake Victoria of [[Tanzania]]. It is the capital of [[Mara Region]], one of the administrative [[Regions of Tanzania]]. It also serves as the administrative centre of [[Musoma Rural District]] and [[Musoma Urban District]].

==Location==
The city sits on the eastern edge of [[Lake Victoria]], close to the International borders  of [[Tanzania]] with [[Kenya]] and [[Uganda]]. Musoma is located approximately {{convert|60|km|mi}}, directly south of the geographical point where the borders of the three [[East Africa]]n countries intersect. The town is located approximately {{convert|225|km|mi}}, by road, northeast of [[Mwanza]], the nearest large city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Tanzania_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Musoma%20(Mara)&toplace=Mwanza%20(Mwanza)&fromlat=-1.5&tolat=-2.5166667&fromlng=33.8&tolng=32.9|title=Distance between Musoma (Mara) and Mwanza (Mwanza) (Tanzania)|website=distancecalculator.globefeed.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-06}}</ref> Musoma lies approximately {{convert|480|km|mi}}, by road, northwest of [[Arusha]], the location of the headquarters of the [[East African Community]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Tanzania_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Musoma%20(Mara)&toplace=Arusha%20(Arusha)&fromlat=-1.5&tolat=-3.3666667&fromlng=33.8&tolng=36.6833333|title=Distance between Musoma (Mara) and Arusha (Arusha) (Tanzania)|website=distancecalculator.globefeed.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-06}}</ref> The coordinates of Musoma are:1° 30' 0.00"S, 33° 48' 0.00"E (Latitude:-1.5000; Longitude:33.8000).

==History and Etymology==
[[File:Musoma Busbahnhof1.jpg|thumb|Small shops near the bus station.]]
The name '''Musoma''' comes from the word '''Omusoma''' which means, '' a [[spit (landform)|spit]]''. The name refers to Musoma's many spits pointing into the surrounding [[Lake Victoria]].

Among the current resident ethnic groups of [[Mara Region|Mara]], the site that later developed into the town of Musoma was first settled by the Kurya subtribe of Abhakabhwa, commonly called Wakabwa. They also gave the name to the location. Hence, Musoma originates from the Kabwa word 'Omusoma', which actually means a piece of land that protrudes into the Lake, essentially, a peninsula. All the kingdoms in Mara, which are actually sub-kingdoms of people with a common ancestry use the word 'Omusoma' (for the Wakabwa, as well as the Wajita and the closely related sub tribes of Wakwaya, Waruri, Wakara, and Wakerewe) and 'Omosoma' (for the many Kurianic sub-tribes such as Abhakerobha - commonly called Wakiroba; Wasimbiti, Wakenye, nk.).  The full name is actually "Omosoma (or 'Omusoma') ghwa Nyabhamba".

Musoma was hotly contested and witnessed many intra-ethnic wars, particularly between the Wakabwa and their kins, the Wakiroba - who were second to arrive in the location after the Wakabwa. The Wakabwa brought in their allies, the non-Bantu Luo and were on the tip of winning the war. The Wakiroba turned to their allies, the Wakwaya but were still heading for defeat. Seeing the situation worsen, the Wakwaya and Wakiroba sought support from the Germans, who at that time had arrived in Mwanza but not yet conquered present day Mara. It was under severe attacks by the German Canons that the Wakabwa and their allies the Luo could be defeated and chased away from the area. A legacy of this war are several mass graves just outside Musoma, particularly in Nyabhange (now commonly called Nyabangi) in Kiroba Land. From that time on, the Wakiroba and Wakwaya became resident neighbors of Musoma, dominating its population for a very long time. Now Musoma is significantly cosmopolitan.

The first headquarters of the occupying Germans was established in Nyabangi, but - just like in the case of Bagamoyo on the Indian Ocean Coast, which was the first Capital of [[German East Africa]] - it  was abandoned due to shallow waters that made an unsuitable location for a harbour. Musoma became the new capital. Today, the old German 'Boma' is testimony to this history of Musoma.

== Geography ==
[[File:Musoma Seeufer.jpg|thumb|The southern shore of Lake Victoria in Musoma.]]

Musoma is home to the Wakiroba subtribe of the Kuria, and to the Kwaya subtribe that is closely related with Wajita, Waruri, Wasimbiti and Wakara. It is also home to the Wajita, Waruri, Wakara, all Kuria sub tribes (including the Wazanaki and Waikizu), and the [[Luo (Kenya and Tanzania)|Luo]], among others. Over time, several ethnic groups from other parts of Tanzania and East Africa have chosen Musoma as their home, such as Somalis. Altogether more than 12 ethnic groups live in Musoma.

==Economic activity==
[[File:M.V. Musoma.JPG|thumb|Ferry M.V. Musoma in the port of Musoma town.]]
Many people in Musoma are engaged in fishing [[Nile perch]] from the lake, or own and run small businesses, or are simply employed in the  public sector or private sector (both formal and informal). Those living in Musoma Rural District are also Pastoralists, and many grow cotton as a cash crop. There are plans underway to construct a railway line from the port of [[Tanga, Tanzania|Tanga]] on the [[Indian Ocean]], through [[Arusha]], around [[Serengeti National Park]] to Musoma. From Musoma, goods will be transferred to barges and transported over [[Lake Victoria]], to [[Port Bell]] in [[Kampala]]. The project is a joint venture between the governments of Tanzania and Uganda and is expected to cost about US$1.9 billion.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.eturbonews.com/27513/tanga-arusha-musoma-railway-skips-serengeti-national-park|title=Tanga-Arusha-Musoma railway skips Serengeti National Park - eTurboNews (eTN)|last=Arusha|first=Adam Ihucha, eTN|date=2012-01-21|work=eTurboNews (eTN)|access-date=2017-07-06|language=en-US}}</ref> The city is also served by [[Musoma Airport]].
