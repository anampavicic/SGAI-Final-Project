'''São Bernardo do Campo''' ({{IPA|pt|sɐ̃w beʁˈnaʁdu du ˈkɐ̃pu}}) is a Brazilian [[Municipalities of Brazil|municipality]] in the [[state of São Paulo]].

It is part of the [[Metropolitan Region of São Paulo]].<ref>[http://governo-sp.jusbrasil.com.br/legislacao/1028148/lei-complementar-1139-11 Lei Complementar nº 1.139, de 16 de junho de 2011]</ref> The population is 810,729 (2022 census) in an area of {{cvt|409.51|km2}}.<ref>[http://cod.ibge.gov.br/233U7 Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística]</ref>

According to 2021 data from the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE)]], the municipality of São Bernardo do Campo has the 16th largest gross domestic product (GDP) among Brazilian cities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=São Bernardo – Guia do cidade São Bernardo -SP Aqui você Encontra ! |url=https://www.encontrasaobernardo.com.br/ |access-date=2024-09-24 |website=www.encontrasaobernardo.com.br |language=pt-br}}</ref>

==History==
The city was founded by [[João Ramalho]] in 1553 and was known as Vila de [[Santo André da Borda do Campo]] de Piratininga, soon transferred to another nearby place, safer from hostile tribes. It is, however, historically perceived as the first Brazilian settlement built away from the sea. The original settlement was then resettled as São Bernardo, became a parish in 1812 and became a municipality in 1890. In 1938, it became a part of the [[Santo André, Brazil|Santo André]] district only to be separated again in 1945, as the aftermath of an action from a group of entrepreneurs led by [[Wallace Cochrane Simonsen]], who was eventually appointed as the first mayor of the newborn municipality.<ref name="PMSBCtl">{{cite web | title = Timeline of the Mayors of São Bernardo do Campo | url = http://www.saobernardo.sp.gov.br/comuns/pqt_container_r01.asp?srcpg=historia_historia_prefeitos_curriculum&area=&ref=11 | website = City Hall of São Bernardo do Campo | language = pt | access-date = 23 December 2013 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221059/http://www.saobernardo.sp.gov.br/comuns/pqt_container_r01.asp?srcpg=historia_historia_prefeitos_curriculum&area=&ref=11 | archive-date = 17 December 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.al.sp.gov.br/documentacao/municipios-paulistas|title=Municípios Paulistas|access-date=2024-06-26|website=www.al.sp.gov.br|language=Portuguese}}</ref>

The area where São Bernardo do Campo, [[Santo André]], [[São Caetano do Sul]], and [[Diadema, São Paulo|Diadema]] are located was once a farm owned by Benedictine monks, who owned enslaved Africans. By the second half of the 19th century, European immigrants started to come to the area, mainly from Italy. Italians settled in cottages in the rural area of São Bernardo do Campo that were called colônias. By the beginning of the 20th century, Japanese immigrants arrived, most of them going to the neighborhood called Cooperativa.

Industry, particularly metal works, thrived in the city during the 1960s, when São Bernardo do Campo became known as Brazil's '' Automobile Capital'' (Portuguese: ''a Capital do Automóvel''). Many of these plants have since relocated to other regions but the automobile industry remains a vital part of the history of São Bernardo do Campo. The city is also known for its furniture industry developed by Italian immigrants, who helped São Bernardo do Campo become a high-tech industrial hub.

Industrialization also attracted migrants from the Brazilian Northeastern region in the 1960s. Among them was the family of  [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], who grew up in the region. The future president of Brazil worked in automobile factories in São Bernardo do Campo in the 1970s, becoming a union and anti-military dictatorship figure.

São Bernardo also contributed to the development of Brazilian cinema, mainly during the 1950s and 1960s, thanks to the [[Companhia Cinematográfica Vera Cruz|Vera Cruz]] studios, which produced a great number of movies and revealed many notable actors. This is also the birthplace of the football player [[Anderson Luís de Souza]], better known as Deco.

==Economy==
[[File:Sao-Bernardo-do-Campo-2018.jpg|thumb|250px|The real estate is one of the fastest growing in the city.]]
São Bernardo do Campo, from the 1950s had its economy based on the [[auto industry]] – At that time, the  Brazilian Federal Government headed by [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] decided to create an executive board to promote local carmaking – the [[Grupo Executivo da Indústria Automobilística]] (GEIA) (Executive Group for Automobile Industry). Providing, among other regulations, a minimum amount of national components to integrate the vehicles, it stimulated the implantation of carmakers and auto parts industries.<ref name="z">Quatro Rodas Magazine, ed. 556, September 2006, p.160-165</ref>

At that time, the German companies [[Volkswagen]], [[Karmann-Ghia]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]], as well the American [[Willys-Overland]] started to build their factories in São Bernardo do Campo, later followed by Simca, [[Toyota]] and [[Scania AB|Scania]].

In 1967, Willys-Overland has been bought by [[Ford Motor Co.]] In that same year, the French carmaker [[Simca]] became a [[Chrysler]] plant, ending its operations in 1981 when it was acquired from Volkswagen to be their truck division. This plant has been shut down definitely in 1990<ref name="zz">{{cite web |url=http://www.vwcaminhoes.com.br/pt/company_history.aspx |title=Archived copy |website=www.vwcaminhoes.com.br |access-date=17 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303232452/http://www.vwcaminhoes.com.br/pt/company_history.aspx |archive-date=3 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and gave place in 2006 to a warehouse from one of the biggest retail stores in Brazil, [[Casas Bahia]].

Together with those first automakers in Brazil, other factories established themselves in the city, e.g. paint industries as [[BASF]], which produces Suvinil brand paintings, and auto parts industries that support them, as well the largest industrial plant in the world of [[Colgate-Palmolive]] [[Colgate (toothpaste)|toothpaste]].

In the 1990s, the economy of the region had a wide variation, which increased the importance of the service sector in the city. The trade is diverse and found in every neighborhood, especially the traditional trade Marshal Deodoro Street and environs, and the nationally known Center Furniture at Jurubatuba street, which gives São Bernardo do Campo the name of ''Furniture Capital''. The construction and urban reform was boosted in 2008 with the construction of the southern section of the [[Rodoanel Mário Covas]] beltway, a ring road in the Metropolitan Region of São Paulo, Avenida Pery Ronchetti with duplication and channeling Saracantan stream, plus the construction of many buildings, mostly residential, with reforms of the Metropolis Mall and the Golden Shopping Mall.

{{As of|2014}}, São Bernardo do Campo exports $3.59B (USD) worth of goods and represents 1.48% of Brazil's total exports.  Transportation manufacturing and machine manufacturing make up the majority (84%) of the municipality's exports.  The top five material goods exported by São Bernardo do Campo are Delivery Trucks (14%), [[Tractor]]s (14%), [[Chassis|Vehicle Chassis]] (13%), Cars (13%), and Vehicle Parts (12%).<ref>DataViva.

==Transportation==
The city is a core part of the [[ABC Region|ABCD region]] (A = Santo '''A'''ndré, B = São '''B'''ernardo do Campo, C = São '''C'''aetano do Sul, D = '''D'''iadema).

===Roads===
* [[Via Anchieta]] ([[SP-150]]): state toll road operated by [[Ecovias dos Imigrantes]] company, links the city of [[São Paulo]] to [[Port of Santos]] and neighboring towns. Established in 1949, it is an important traffic route for trucks carrying goods to be exported from Santos. As Via Anchieta has many exits throughout the city, they become important traffic routes to allow people's displacement inside São Bernardo do Campo. Due to its strategical placement, many large factories are based at the edges of the road, for example [[Volkswagen]] and [[Mercedes-Benz]] plants.
* [[Rodovia dos Imigrantes]] ([[SP-160]]): state toll highway operated by [[Ecovias dos Imigrantes]] company, links the city of São Paulo to the southern shore of [[State of São Paulo]], specially [[São Vicente, São Paulo|São Vicente]] and [[Praia Grande]] municipalities. It started its operations in 1976 as a one-way highway (switched from uphill to downhill direction depending on the traffic intensity) and gained its definitely downhill path in 2002.
* [[Perito Criminal Eng. Antonio Carlos Moraes/Interligação do Planalto]] ([[SP-041]]): short state road designed to link Via Anchieta and Rodovia dos Imigrantes roads, allowing vehicles to change from one to the other in case of special operations, traffic constraints or weather difficulties. Those three roads, among with some other ones in the shore, compose the [[Sistema Anchieta-Imigrantes]], fully operated by Ecovias dos Imigrantes.
* [[Rodovia Índio Tibiriçá]] ([[SP-031]]): state road operated by the [[Departamento de Estradas de Rodagem]] (DER-SP) connecting São Bernardo do Campo to the city of [[Suzano]], in the [[Metropolitan Region of São Paulo]]. It is also used to have access to the municipalities of [[Ribeirão Pires]] and [[Rio Grande da Serra]], as well [[Santo André]]'s [[Paranapiacaba]] district.
* [[Caminho do Mar]] ([[SP-148]]): historical state road operated by the [[Departamento de Estradas de Rodagem]], it connected São Bernardo do Campo to the city of [[Cubatão]], thus allowing access to the [[Port of Santos]] and the shore itself. It has been fitted to serve automobiles in 1913 but, with the establishment of [[Via Anchieta]] and [[Rodovia dos Imigrantes]], its path seemed to be not suitable for traffic anymore. Today it is used only to reach [[Rodovia Índio Tibiriçá]] and some neighborhoods along the [[Billings Reservoir]], although its old mountain path can still be reached by walking.
* [[Rodoanel Mário Covas]] ([[SP-021]]): state toll highway operated by [[SPMar]] company in its south lot and by [[CCR RodoAnel]] in its west lot, it is a beltway intended to connect all major roads and highways surrounding the [[Metropolitan Region of São Paulo]], thus decreasing the need for trucks to cross the city of São Paulo. At its current completion, it links [[Via Anchieta]] and [[Rodovia dos Imigrantes]] directly to [[Rodovia Régis Bittencourt]] (heading South of Brazil), [[Rodovia Raposo Tavares]] (westbound of São Paulo State, [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] State), [[Rodovia Castelo Branco]] (westbound of São Paulo State, North of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] State), [[Via Anhanguera]] (North São Paulo state, [[Goiás]] State, [[Brasília]]) and [[Rodovia dos Bandeirantes]] (central region of São Paulo State, [[Viracopos International Airport]] – VCP). It also reaches city of [[Mauá]] and thru expressways, gives access to [[Rodovia Ayrton Senna]], therefore to [[Gov. André Franco Montoro International Airport]] in [[Guarulhos]] – [[GRU (Russian Federation)|GRU]]).

===Public transportation===
Public transportation in São Bernardo do Campo is provided by ETCSBC (Empresa de Transporte Coletivo de São Bernardo do Campo) and EMTU (Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos, "Metropolitan Urban Transport Company").

Local bus service is provided by [[SBCTrans]] – Consórcio São Bernardo Transportes, which has owned the rights to operate the [[ETCSBC]] – [[Empresa de Transporte Coletivo de São Bernardo do Campo]] routes in 1998.<ref name="j">{{cite web|url=http://www.sbctrans.com/empresa/historia.php|title=SBC Trans|publisher=sbctrans.com|access-date=13 September 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903170651/http://www.sbctrans.com/empresa/historia.php|archive-date=3 September 2014}}</ref> Buses and minibuses are used in this operation. Intercity buses are also available connecting São Bernardo do Campo to [[Diadema, São Paulo|Diadema]], [[Mauá]], [[Osasco]], [[Ribeirão Pires]], [[Rio Grande da Serra]], [[Santo André]], [[São Caetano do Sul]] and São Paulo.<ref name="e">{{cite web|url=http://www.emtu.sp.gov.br/emtu/itinerarios-e-tarifas/consulte-origem-e-destino/por-regiao-metropolitana.fss|title=EMTU – Consulte origem e destino – Por Região Metropolitana|publisher=emtu.sp.gov.br|access-date=13 September 2014}}</ref> Many bus companies operate such routes under permission of [[EMTU]] – [[Empresa Metropolitana de Transportes Urbanos de São Paulo]], a state-owned company.

EMTU is also responsible for the [[São Mateus–Jabaquara Metropolitan Corridor|Corredor São Mateus-Jabaquara]] bus system, connecting [[Diadema, São Paulo|Diadema]], [[Santo André]], [[Mauá]] and South and East regions of São Paulo. It is operated by [[METRA]] – Sistema Metropolitano de Transportes. As it uses a busway in most of its path, it is considered a [[bus Rapid Transit]] system. It also provides access to Line 1 of [[São Paulo Metro]] thru Jabaquara terminal, the Jabaquara Bus Terminal and Line 10 of the commuter rail [[CPTM]] in [[Santo André]] station. This bus system is often called as [[trolleybus]] system as it employs many trolley buses.
