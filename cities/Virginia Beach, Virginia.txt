'''Virginia Beach''', officially the '''City of Virginia Beach''', is the [[List of cities in Virginia|most populous city]] in the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] in the United States. The population was 459,470 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]].<ref name="QuickFacts" /> Located on the southeastern coast of Virginia, it is the sixth-most populous city in the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|Mid-Atlantic]] and the [[List of United States cities by population|43rd-most populous city in the U.S]]. Located on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] at the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], Virginia Beach is a principal city in the [[Hampton Roads]] metropolitan area which has more than 1.8 million inhabitants and is the [[Metropolitan statistical area|37th-largest metropolitan area]] in the U.S.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virginia.org/places-to-visit/regions/hampton-roads/|title=Hampton Roads|website=Virginia.org|access-date=August 7, 2016}}</ref>

Virginia Beach is a [[resort city]] with miles of beaches and hundreds of hotels, motels, and restaurants along its [[Virginia Beach Oceanfront|oceanfront]]. Near the point where the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean meet, [[Cape Henry]] was the site of the [[First Landing State Park|first landing]] of the English colonists who eventually settled in [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]]; modern Virginia Beach was established in 1906. It is home to several state parks, protected beaches, and military bases. [[Virginia Wesleyan University]], [[Regent University]], [[Christian Broadcasting Network]], the U.S. headquarters of [[Stihl]], and the [[Association for Research and Enlightenment]] are based in Virginia Beach. It also hosts the annual [[East Coast Surfing Championships]] and [[Neptune Festival]].

The city is listed in the ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' as having the longest pleasure beach in the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tripandtravelblog.com/virginia-beach-also-the-worlds-longest-stretch-of-pleasure-beach/|title=Virginia Beach also the world's longest stretch of pleasure Beach|date=September 12, 2012 |access-date=September 12, 2012}}</ref> It is located at the southern end of the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]], which was the world's longest [[bridge-tunnel]] complex<ref name="Superlatives USA">{{cite book | author = Melissa Jones | title = Superlatives USA: The Largest, Smallest, Longest, Shortest, and Wackiest Sites in America | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=yALhYMYGY6AC&pg=PA137 | access-date = October 12, 2012 | date = March 15, 2005 | publisher = Capital Books | isbn = 978-1-931868-85-3 | pages = 137–}}</ref> until the [[Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge]] opened in 2018.<ref name="World's longest sea crossing">{{cite news | author = BBC | title = World's longest sea crossing: Hong Kong-Zhuhai bridge opens | url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-45937924 | access-date = October 23, 2018}}</ref>

They would have spoken one of the [[Algonquian languages]]. These were common among the numerous tribes of the coastal area, who made up the loose [[Powhatan Confederacy]], numbering in the tens of thousands in population. The Chesepian occupied an area which is now defined as the independent cities of Norfolk, Portsmouth, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.<ref name="400 Years of Change">{{cite web | url = http://www.nps.gov/came/ | title = Cape Henry Memorial | access-date = March 19, 2008 | publisher = U.S. National Park System}}</ref>

In 1607, after a voyage of 144 days, three ships headed by Captain [[Christopher Newport]], and carrying 105 men and boys, made their first landfall in the New World on the mainland, where the southern mouth of the Chesapeake Bay meets the Atlantic Ocean. They named it Cape Henry, after [[Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales]], the eldest son of King [[James I of England]]. These English colonists of the [[London Company|Virginia Company of London]] moved on from this area, as they were under orders to seek a site further inland, which would be more sheltered from ships of competing European countries. They created their first permanent settlement on the north side of the [[James River]] at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]].<ref name="Cape Henry Memorial">{{cite web|author=Moon, Shep|title=400 Years of Change|url=http://www.deq.state.va.us/coastal/ss2007400yearsofchange.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090703223452/http://www.deq.state.va.us/coastal/ss2007400yearsofchange.html|archive-date=July 3, 2009|access-date=March 19, 2008|publisher=Virginia Department of Environmental Quality}}</ref>

[[Adam Thoroughgood]] (1604–1640) of [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]], England is one of the earliest Englishmen to settle in this area, which was developed as Virginia Beach. At the age of 18, he had contracted as an [[indentured servant]] to pay for passage to the [[Virginia Colony]] in the hopes of bettering his life. He earned his freedom after several years and became a leading citizen of the area. In 1629, he was elected to the [[House of Burgesses]] for [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] {{sic}}, one of four "cities" (or incorporations) which were subdivided areas established in 1619.<ref name = "Norfolk History Chapter 4"/>

In 1634, the Colony was divided into the original eight [[shires of Virginia]], soon renamed as [[county|counties]]. Thoroughgood is credited with using the name of his home in England when helping name "[[New Norfolk County]]" in 1637. The following year, New Norfolk County was split into [[Upper Norfolk County]] (soon renamed [[Nansemond County, Virginia|Nansemond County]]) and [[Lower Norfolk County]]. Thoroughgood resided after 1634 was along the [[Lynnhaven River]], named for his home in England.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pilotonline.com/history/article_9a020e50-523c-58bf-bf32-ebb84bf0ba2d.html|title=What's in a name?: Lynnhaven River, Virginia Beach|last=Harper|first=Scott|date=April 26, 2010|website=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]|access-date=April 26, 2010}}</ref>

Lower Norfolk County was large when first organized, defined as from the Atlantic Ocean west past the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], encompassing the entire area now within the modern cities of Portsmouth, Norfolk, Chesapeake, and Virginia Beach.<ref name="Norfolk History Chapter 4">{{cite web|title=The Origins of Norfolk's Name|url=http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010818221124/http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html|archive-date=August 18, 2001|access-date=October 9, 2007|publisher=Norfolk Historical Society}}</ref> It attracted many entrepreneurs, including William Moseley with his family in 1648. Belonging to the Merchant Adventurers Guild of London, he immigrated from [[Rotterdam]] of the [[Netherlands]], where he had been in international trade. He settled on land on the north side of the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]], east of what developed as [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]].

Following the increased settlement, in 1691 Lower Norfolk County was divided to form [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk]] and [[Princess Anne County, Virginia|Princess Anne]] counties. Princess Anne, the easternmost county in South Hampton Roads, extended from Cape Henry at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay, south to what became the border of the North Carolina colony. It included all of the area fronting the Atlantic Ocean. Princess Anne County was known as a jurisdiction from 1691 to 1963, over 250 years.<ref name="Norfolk History Chapter 9">{{cite web|title=Norfolk Becomes a Borough|url=http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/09.html|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010421025249/http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/09.html|archive-date=April 21, 2001|access-date=October 9, 2007|publisher=Norfolk Historical Society}}</ref>

In the early centuries, this area was rural and developed for plantation agriculture. In the late 19th century, the small resort area of Virginia Beach developed in Princess Anne County after the 1883 arrival of rail service to the coast. The Virginia Beach Hotel was opened and operated by the Norfolk and Virginia Beach Railroad and Improvement Company at the oceanfront, near the tiny community of [[Seatack, Virginia|Seatack]]. The hotel was foreclosed and the railroad was reorganized in 1887. The hotel was upgraded and reopened in 1888 as the Princess Anne Hotel.<ref>Jonathan Mark Souther, "Twixt Ocean and Pines: The Seaside Resort at Virginia Beach, 1880-1930." M.A. thesis, University of Richmond, 1996.</ref>

In 1891, guests at the new hotel watched the wreck and rescue efforts of the [[United States Life-Saving Service]] for the Norwegian barque ''Dictator''. The ship's figurehead, which washed up on the beach several days later, was erected as a monument to the victims and rescuers. It stood along the oceanfront for more than 50 years. In the 21st century, it inspired the pair of matching [[Norwegian Lady|Norwegian Lady Monuments]], sculpted by [[Ørnulf Bast]] and installed in Virginia Beach and [[Moss, Norway]].<ref>Foss, William O., ''The Norwegian Lady and the Wreck of the Dictator''. Virginia Beach, Virginia: Noreg Books, 2002. {{ISBN|0-9721989-0-3}}</ref>

The resort initially depended on [[railroad]] and [[electric trolley]] service. The completion of [[Virginia Beach Boulevard]] in 1922, which extended from Norfolk to the oceanfront, opened the route for [[automobile]]s, [[bus]]es, and [[truck]]s. The passenger rail service to the oceanfront was eventually discontinued as traffic increased by vehicles. The growing resort of Virginia Beach became an [[incorporated town]] in 1906. Over the next 45 years, Virginia Beach continued to grow in popularity as a seasonal vacation spot. The casinos were replaced by amusement parks and family-oriented attractions. In 1927 The [[Cavalier Hotel]] opened and became a popular vacation spot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pilotonline.com/history/article_096b978e-eccb-52d1-94d1-73330d09eb39.html?outputType=amp|title=1927: The grand opening of the Cavalier Hotel|last=Hays|first=Jakon|date=April 4, 2017|website=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]|access-date=April 4, 2017|archive-date=December 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221207223636/https://www.pilotonline.com/history/article_096b978e-eccb-52d1-94d1-73330d09eb39.html?outputType=amp|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.virginiabusiness.com/article/cavalier-resort-takes-shape-in-virginia-beach/|title=Cavalier Resort takes shape in Virginia Beach|last=Griset|first=Rich|date=April 29, 2021|website=Virginiabusiness.com|access-date=April 29, 2021}}</ref>

Virginia Beach gained status as an independent city in 1952, although ties remained between it and Princess Anne County. In 1963, after voters in the two jurisdictions passed a supporting referendum, and with the approval of the [[Virginia General Assembly]], the two political subdivisions were consolidated as a new, much larger independent city, retaining the better-known name of the Virginia Beach resort.<ref name="Virginia Beach History">{{cite web | url = https://www.virginiabeach.com/listing/attractions/history | title = Virginia Beach History | access-date = March 21, 2008 | publisher = VirginiaBeach.com}}</ref>

Real estate, defense, and tourism are major sectors of the Virginia Beach economy. Many local public and private groups have maintained a vested interest in real-estate redevelopment, resulting in a number of joint public-private projects, such as commercial parks. Examples of the public-private development include the Virginia Beach Convention Center, the Oceanfront Hilton Hotel, and the [[Virginia Beach Town Center]]. The city assisted in financing the project through the use of tax increment financing: creating special tax districts and constructing associated street and infrastructure to support the developments. The Town Center opened in 2003, with related construction continuing.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ourcommunitynow.com/news/new-development-going-up-in-virginia-beach-town-center|title=New Development Going up in Virginia Beach Town Center|date=October 25, 2017|website=Our Community Now|access-date=February 12, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.pilotonline.com/government/local/vp-nw-town-center-high-rise-0422-20210422-45aik77t3zdtjiqsp4iheytcsm-story.html|title=An Armada Hoffler company has 3 more years to develop plans to build a high rise in Town Center|last=Skelton|first=Alissa|date=April 22, 2021|website=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]|access-date=February 12, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://hrchamber.com/news/article/nike-rethinks-retail-with-divaris-real-estate-at-virginia-beach-town-center/|title=Nike Rethinks Retail With Divaris Real Estate At Virginia Beach Town Center|date=January 22, 2022|website=Hampton Roads Chamber|access-date=April 11, 2023}}</ref> The Convention Center opened in 2005.<ref name="VBTC Financing">{{cite web|title=Town Center|url=http://vbgov.com/vgn.aspx?vgnextoid=5542340df304c010VgnVCM1000006310640aRCRD&vgnextchannel=c803a9893c5dd010VgnVCM1000006310640aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120180249/http://vbgov.com/vgn.aspx?vgnextoid=5542340df304c010VgnVCM1000006310640aRCRD&vgnextchannel=c803a9893c5dd010VgnVCM1000006310640aRCRD&vgnextfmt=default|archive-date=November 20, 2007|access-date=March 8, 2007|publisher=City of Virginia Beach}}</ref><ref name="Phase I">{{cite web | url = http://meetingsnet.com/news/meetings_phase_virginia_beach/ | title = Phase I of Virginia Beach Convention Center Set to Open in June | author = Barbara L.

This rejection was significant from two perspectives. First, cities reject building very rarely, demonstrating the shift in public perception. Second, these rejections led to lawsuits by the developers. The rejection of these lawsuits in the courts provides precedent for other sorts of local [[climate change adaptation]] efforts in the future. Discussing the matter, Mayor Dyer noted, "It's a confrontation with reality.

Much of the year in Virginia Beach is mild to warm. The long summer season from late May through late September is often hot and humid, with frequent (but brief) late day thundershowers. Winters are cool with little frozen precipitation, and snowfall is light.  The official weather statistics are recorded at Norfolk International Airport on the extreme northwestern border of Virginia Beach. The mean annual temperature is {{convert|59.6|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, with an average annual snowfall of {{convert|5.8|in|mm}} at the airport to around {{convert|3.0|in|mm}} in the southeastern corner around Back Bay.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/cliMAIN.pl?va0385 | title = Climate Summary }}</ref> Average annual precipitation (the large majority rainfall) is high, ranging between {{convert|47|in|mm}} at the airport to over {{convert|50|in|mm}} per year at Back Bay. The wettest season is summer, specifically July to early September, with August the single wettest month, averaging over 5.5 inches of rain. From October to June, average monthly precipitation is remarkably consistent, ranging between 3.1 and 3.7 inches. Virginia Beach averages 2200 hours of sunshine annually, higher than the USA average.

The highest recorded temperature to date was {{convert|105|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in July 2010, and the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|-3|°F}} in January 1985, both being recorded at Norfolk International Airport.<ref name="NWS Wakefield, VA (AKQ)" /> The coldest daily maximum on record was {{convert|12|F|C}} in December 1917, whereas the 1991–2020 normals had a coldest maximum average of {{convert|29|F|C}}.<ref name="NWS Wakefield, VA (AKQ)" /> This means that in spite of the mild normals, most years record at least one ice day, with rare exceptions. Summer nights are sometimes really hot. The all-time record warmest low temperature is {{convert|84|F|C}} from July 1942, while a normal year's warmest night averages {{convert|80|F|C}}.<ref name="NWS Wakefield, VA (AKQ)" />

Additionally, the geographic location of the city, with respect to the principal storm tracks, is especially favorable which is why it has earned the reputation as a vacation destination. It is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms, with the exception of [[Hurricane Isabel]] in 2003.<ref name="Virginia Hurricane Climatology">Information from [http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/vaclimohur.htm NOAA].</ref> Because of the moderating effects of the Chesapeake Bay and the Atlantic Ocean, Virginia Beach is the northernmost location on the east coast in which many species of plants (both subtropical and tropical) will reliably grow. [[Spanish moss]], for example is near the northernmost limit of its natural range at [[First Landing State Park]], and is the most northerly location where it is widespread. Other plants like the [[Windmill Palm]], [[Sabal palmetto]], [[Butia odorata]] (in protected locations), and [[Oleander]] are successfully grown here while they succumb to the colder winter temperatures to the north and inland to the west. The [[hardiness zone]] is 8b along the coast and in Urban areas, and 8a inland and to the northwest. 

On April 30, 2023, an EF-3 [[tornado]] struck the Great Neck neighborhood in the northeastern section of the city. It was on the ground from 5:48 to 5:53 PM EST.

Virginia Beach was chartered as a municipal corporation by the General Assembly of Virginia on January 1, 1963. The city currently operates under the [[Council–manager government|council–manager form of government]].<ref name = "City Government Form"/> Like all incorporated cities in Virginia, it is an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] and does not fall under the jurisdiction of a [[county (United States)|county]] government.

The city's legislative body consists of an eleven-member [[city council]]. The [[city manager]] is appointed by the council and acts as the chief executive officer. Through his staff, he implements policies established by the council.<ref name = "City Council"/>

Members of the city council normally serve four-year terms and are elected on a staggered basis in non-partisan elections.

[[File:Frank W Cox High School.jpg|thumb|right|The current building of Frank W. Cox High School]]
According to the [[United States Census|U.S. Census]], 28.1% of the population over twenty-five (vs. a national average of 24%) hold a bachelor's degree or higher, and 90.4% (vs. 80% nationally) have a high school diploma or equivalent.

Prior to 1969, separate schools were maintained for black and white students. Before 1938, black students who wished to attend school past seventh grade had to travel to Norfolk and pay tuition to attend [[Booker T. Washington High School (Norfolk, Virginia)|Booker T. Washington High School]]. In 1938, the first high school for blacks, the [[Princess Anne County Training School]] was built. In 1961, in order to avoid the stigma of the term "training school", the school was renamed Union Kempsville High School at the request of the black community. When the public schools integrated in 1969, Union Kempsville was closed.<ref name="80 years">{{cite news|last1=Harki|first1=Gary A|date=September 22, 2018|title=Eighty years later, students from Virginia Beach's first black high school remember|newspaper=[[The Virginian-Pilot]]|url=https://pilotonline.com/news/article_a8cea3a0-be9b-11e8-8755-f32bd5a21ec4.html|url-status=dead|access-date=December 20, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180922235424/https://pilotonline.com/news/article_a8cea3a0-be9b-11e8-8755-f32bd5a21ec4.html|archive-date=September 22, 2018}}</ref><ref name="vtech">{{cite thesis | type = PhD | title = The History of Princess Anne County Training School and Union Kempsville High School Princess Anne County/Virginia Beach, Virginia 1925-1969 | url = http://hdl.handle.net/10919/19367 | access-date = December 20, 2018 | date = April 27, 2013 | last1 = Lucas | first1 = Joanne Harris| hdl = 10919/19367 }}</ref><ref name="PACTS A & E">{{cite web | title = princess anne county training school union kempsville high school alumni and friends association, inc. | url = http://www.pacts-ukhs.org/ | access-date = December 20, 2018}}</ref>
