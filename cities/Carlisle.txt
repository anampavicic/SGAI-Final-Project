It is the administrative centre of [[Cumberland Council]] which covers an area similar to the [[Historic counties of England|historic county]] of [[Cumberland]].

Carlisle's early history is marked by the establishment of a human [[Luguvalium|settlement]] to serve castles along [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Great Britain|Britain]].<ref>{{cite EB9 |mode=cs2 |wstitle=Carlisle (1.) |volume=5|ref={{harvid|''EB''|1878}} |pages=108–110 }}</ref> Due to its proximity to Scotland (being located {{convert|8|mi|km|0|abbr=off|spell=on|disp=or}} south of the current [[Anglo-Scottish border]]), [[Carlisle Castle]] and the city became an important military stronghold in the [[Middle Ages]].

In the early 12th century, a priory was built and gained [[Carlisle Cathedral|cathedral]] status with a [[Diocese of Carlisle|diocese]] in 1133 ([[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] at the time meant the settlement became a city) while the county of Cumberland was created and later renamed Cumbria.

In the 19th century, the introduction of [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution]] began a process of [[socioeconomic]] transformation in Carlisle, which developed into a densely populated [[mill town]]. This, combined with its strategic position, allowed for the development of Carlisle as an important [[railway town]], with seven railway companies sharing [[Carlisle railway station]].

=== Ancient Carlisle ===
{{Main|Luguvalium}}

The ancient history of Carlisle is derived mainly from archaeological evidence and the works of the [[Roman historiography|Roman historian]] [[Tacitus]]. The earliest recorded inhabitants in the area were the [[Carvetii]] [[list of Celtic tribes|tribe]] of [[Britons (historical)|Britons]] who made up the main population of ancient [[Cumbria]] and [[Lancashire|North Lancashire]].<ref name="carvetii">{{Citation |title=Celtic Tribes of Britain; The Carvetii |url=http://www.roman-britain.org/tribes/carvetii.htm |df=dmy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425010043/http://www.roman-britain.org/tribes/carvetii.htm |publisher=Roman Britain Organisation |access-date=3 May 2011 |archive-date=25 April 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> According to [[Hector Boece|Boethius]] and [[John of Fordun]], writing in the 18th and 19th centuries, Carlisle existed before the [[Roman conquest of Britain|arrival of the Romans in Britain]] and was one of the strongest [[Britons (Celtic people)|British]] towns at the time. In the time of the [[list of Roman emperors|emperor]] [[Nero]], it was said to have burned down.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Samuel Sampson |title=The Agreeable Historian, or the Complete English Traveller |year=1746}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Fordun |first1=John of |last2=Skene |first2=Felix James Henry |last3=Skene |first3=W.

The fort at Carlisle was reconstructed in 83 using [[oak]] timbers from further afield, rather than local [[alder]] as a possible result of the increased Roman control of the area.<ref name="tullietimeline">{{Cite web |title=Timeline of Roman Carlisle |url=http://romans.tulliehouse.co.uk/flash/timeline/index.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826085256/http://romans.tulliehouse.co.uk/flash/timeline/index.htm |archive-date=26 August 2011 |access-date=3 May 2011 |publisher=[[Tullie House Museum and Art Gallery|Tullie House Museum]]}}</ref> At this time the Roman fort was garrisoned by a 500-strong cavalry regiment, the ''{{lang|la|Ala Gallorum Sebosiana}}''.<ref name=irom/>

By the early 2nd century, Carlisle was established as a prominent stronghold. The 'Stanegate' frontier, which consisted of Luguvalium and several other forts in a line east to [[Corbridge]], was proving a more stable frontier against the [[Picts]] than those established deeper into [[Caledonia]]. In 122, the province was visited by [[Hadrian]], who approved a plan to build a wall the length of the frontier. A new fort, [[Petriana]], was therefore built in the [[Stanwix]] area of the city north of the river on [[Hadrian's Wall]]. It was the largest fort along the wall{{citation needed|date=January 2024}} and was completed in stone by around 130. Like Luguvalium, which lay within sight, Petriana housed a nominal 1,000-strong cavalry regiment, the ''[[Ala Gallorum Petriana]]'', the sole regiment of this size along the wall. Hadrian's successor [[Antoninus Pius]] abandoned the frontier and attempted to move further north; he built the [[Antonine Wall]] between the [[firth]]s of [[Firth of Forth|Forth]] and [[Firth of Clyde|Clyde]]. It was not a success and, after 20 years, the garrisons returned to Hadrian's Wall.<ref name=tullietimeline/>

At one time, Carlisle broke off from Rome when [[Carausius|Marcus Carausius]] assumed power over the territory. He was assassinated and suffered ''[[damnatio memoriae]]'', but a surviving reference to him has been uncovered in Carlisle. Coins excavated in the area suggest that Romans remained in Carlisle until the reign of [[Valentinian II|Emperor Valentinian II]], from 375 to 392.

===Middle Ages===

{{main|Rheged|Cumberland|Curse of Carlisle}}
The period of [[Sub-Roman Britain|late antiquity]] [[Roman withdrawal from Britain|after Roman rule]] saw [[Cumbria]] organised as the native [[Britons (historical)|British]] [[kingdom of Rheged]]. It is likely that the kingdom took its name from a major stronghold within it; this has been suggested to have been broadly coterminous with the ''{{lang|la|Civitas Carvetiorum}}'', Carlisle.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Higham, Nick |title=The Northern Counties to AD 1000 |publisher=Longman Higher Education |year=1986}}</ref> King [[Urien]] and his son and successor [[Owain mab Urien|Owain]] became the subjects of a great deal of [[Arthurian legend]].

[[Rheged]] came under Northumbrian control before 730, probably by inheritance after Rienmelth, daughter of Royth and great-granddaughter of Urien, married [[Oswy]], [[King of Northumbria]]. For the rest of the first millennium, Carlisle was an important stronghold contested by several entities who warred over the area, including the [[Celtic Britons|Brythonic]] [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] and the [[Angles (tribe)|Anglian]] [[kingdom of Northumbria]]. In 685, St [[Cuthbert]], visiting the Queen of Northumbria in her sister's monastery at Carlisle, was taken to see the city walls and a marvellously constructed Roman fountain.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bede |title=The Life and Miracles of St. Cuthbert, Bishop of Lindisfarne |url=http://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-cuthbert.asp |access-date=27 November 2015 |website=Internet History Sourcebook |publisher=Fordham University: The Jesuit University of New York |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625103657/https://legacy.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-cuthbert.asp |archive-date=25 June 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

By the time of the [[Norman Conquest]] of England in 1066, Carlisle was in the possession of the Scots. It was not recorded in the 1086 [[Domesday Book]]. This changed in 1092, when [[William the Conqueror]]'s son [[William II of England|William Rufus]] invaded the region and incorporated Carlisle into England. The construction of [[Carlisle Castle]] began in 1093 on the site of the Roman fort, south of the [[River Eden, Cumbria|River Eden]]. The castle was rebuilt in stone in 1112, with a [[keep]] and the [[Carlisle city walls|city walls]]. The walls enclosed the city south of the castle and included three gates to the east, south, and north called the Irish or Caldew Gate, the English or Botcher Gate, and the Scotch or Ricker Gate respectively. The names of the gates exist in road names in Carlisle today. [[Carlisle Cathedral]] was founded as an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] priory and became a cathedral in 1133.<ref name="TTB">Tim Tatton-Brown and John Crook, ''The English Cathedral'', New Holland (2002), {{ISBN|1-84330-120-2}}</ref> In 1157, Carlisle became the seat of the new county of [[Carliol]] (a name that was originally an abbreviation of Latin ''Carlioliensis'', meaning "[Bishop] of Carlisle"); in 1177 the county was renamed [[Cumberland]].

The conquest of Cumberland was the beginning of a war between Scotland and England which saw the region centred around Carlisle change hands a number of times. It was a major stronghold after the construction of the castle. During the wars, the livelihood of the people on the borders was devastated by armies from both sides. Even when the countries were not at war, tension remained high, and royal authority in one or the other kingdom was often weak. The uncertainty of existence meant that communities or peoples kindred to each other sought security through their own strength and cunning, and they improved their livelihoods at their enemies' expense. These peoples were known as the [[Border Reivers]] and Carlisle was the major city within their territories.

The [[Border reivers|Reivers]] became so much of a nuisance to the Scottish and English governments that, in 1525, the [[Archbishop of Glasgow]] Gavin Dunbar cursed all the reivers of the borderlands. The curse was detailed in 1,069 words, beginning: "I curse their head and all the hairs of their head; I curse their face, their brain (innermost thoughts), their mouth, their nose, their tongue, their teeth, their forehead, their shoulders, their breast, their heart, their stomach, their back, their womb, their arms, their leggs, their hands, their feet and every part of their body, from the top of their head to the soles of their feet, before and behind, within and without."<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Border Reivers - The Curse |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/features/2003/07/restoration/the_curse.shtml |access-date=4 May 2011 |publisher=BBC Cumbria |archive-date=14 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111114204513/http://www.bbc.co.uk/cumbria/features/2003/07/restoration/the_curse.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Early Modern era===
[[File:Jacobite broadside - Carlisle.jpg|thumb|300px|Historic view of Carlisle]]
After the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]], [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], concerned at the weakness of his hold on the North, employed (1539) the engineer [[Stefan von Haschenperg]] to modernise the defences of Carlisle. von Haschenperg was sacked in 1543 for having "spent great treasures to no purpose"; but (by him and his successors) at the north end the castle towers were converted to artillery platforms, at the south the medieval Bochard gate was converted into the [[Carlisle Citadel|Citadel]], an artillery fortification with two massive artillery towers.<ref name="Pevsner2">{{Cite book |last1=Hyde |first1=Matthew |title=The Buildings of England: Cumbria; Cumberland, Westmorland and Furness |last2=Pevsner |first2=Nikolaus |date=2010 |publisher=Yale University Press |isbn=978-0-300-12663-1 |location=London}}</ref>{{rp|243}} The death of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] in 1603 and her succession by [[James I of England|James VI of Scotland]] as King James I of England allowed more determined and coordinated efforts to suppress reiving. The borderers were not quick to change their ways and many were hanged and whole families were exiled to Ireland. It was not until 1681 that the problem of the reivers was acknowledged as no longer an issue.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sadler |first=John |title=Border Fury: England and Scotland at War, 1296 - 1568 |publisher=Longman |year=2004}}</ref>

Following the personal union of the crowns Carlisle Castle should have become obsolete as a frontier fortress, but the two kingdoms continued as separate states. In 1639, with war between the two kingdoms looming, the castle was refortified using stone from the cathedral cloisters.<ref name=Pevsner2 /> In 1642 the [[English Civil War]] broke out and the castle was garrisoned for the king. It endured a [[Siege of Carlisle (1645)|long siege]] from October 1644 until June 1645 when the Royalist forces surrendered after the [[Battle of Naseby]]. The city was occupied by a parliamentary garrison, and subsequently by their Scots allies. In 1646, the Scots, now holding Carlisle pending payment of monies owed them by the English Parliament, improved its fortifications, destroying the [[Carlisle Cathedral|cathedral's]] nave to obtain the stone to rebuild the castle.<ref name="caherit">{{cite journal |url=https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/cumberland/contents.cfm?vol_id=639 |journal=Transactions |title=Carlisle during the siege of 1644–5 |first=W |last=Nanson |publisher=[[Cumberland and Westmorland Antiquarian and Archaeological Society]] |volume=7 |year=1884 |access-date=20 November 2021 |archive-date=20 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211120101608/https://archaeologydataservice.ac.uk/archives/view/cumberland/contents.cfm?vol_id=639 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>

In 1698 travel writer [[Celia Fiennes]] wrote of Carlisle as having most of the trappings of a military town and that it was rife with alcohol and prostitutes.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Fiennes |first=Celia |title=Through England on a Side Saddle |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=2009}}</ref>

In 1707 an [[Acts of Union 1707|act of union]] was passed between England and Scotland, creating [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]], but Carlisle remained a garrison town. The tenth, and most recent siege in the city's history took place after [[Charles Edward Stuart]] took Carlisle in the [[Jacobite Rising of 1745]]. When the Jacobites retreated across the border to Scotland they left a garrison of 400 men in Carlisle Castle. Ten days later [[Prince William, Duke of Cumberland]] took the castle and executed 31 Jacobites on the streets of Carlisle.<ref name="caherit" />

===Industrial Revolution===

On Display at the British Museum in London.jpg|thumb|A banknote designed by [[William Home Lizars]] for Carlisle City and District Banking Company highlights the town's industrial features.]]
Although Carlisle continued to garrison soldiers, becoming the headquarters of the [[Border Regiment]], the city's importance as a military town decreased as the [[Industrial Revolution|industrial age]] took over. The post of [[Governor of Carlisle]] as garrison commander was abolished in 1838.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mnBbAAAAQAAJ |title=Accounts and Papers: Seventeen Volumes |publisher=UK Government |year=1838 |page=58}}</ref>

In the early 19th century textile mills, engineering works and food manufacturers built factories in the city mostly in the [[Denton Holme]], Caldewgate and Wapping suburbs in the Caldew Valley.<ref>Allen J. Scott, "Solway Country" (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2015</ref> These included [[Carr's|Carr's of Carlisle]], [[Kangol]], Metal Box and Cowans Sheldon. [[Dixon's Chimney and Shaddon Mill|Shaddon Mill]], in Denton Holme, became famous for having the world's 8th tallest chimney and was the largest cotton mill in England.

The expanding industries brought about an increase in population as jobs shifted from rural farms towards the cities. This produced a housing shortage where at one point 25,000 people in the city only had 5,000 houses to live in. People were said to be herded together with animal houses, slaughter houses and communal lavatories with open drains running between them. Living conditions were so bad that riots were common and some people emigrated. The problem wasn't solved until the end of the 19th century when mass housing was built west of the city walls.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Carlisle - History |url=http://www.edgeguide.co.uk/cumbria/carlislehistory.html |access-date=3 May 2011 |publisher=EDGE Guide |archive-date=25 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110625090032/http://www.edgeguide.co.uk/cumbria/carlislehistory.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1823 a canal was built to Fisher's Cross ([[Port Carlisle]]) to transport goods produced in the city. This enabled other industrial centres such as [[Liverpool]] to link with Carlisle via the [[Solway Firth|Solway]]. This was short-lived and when the canal operators ran into financial difficulty the waterway was filled in.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Port Carlisle |url=http://www.visitcumbria.com/car/port-carlisle.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514054516/http://www.visitcumbria.com/car/port-carlisle.htm |archive-date=14 May 2011 |access-date=3 May 2011 |publisher=Visit Cumbria |df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Carlisle and Silloth Bay Railway|A railway]] was built in place of the canal.

Carlisle became a major [[railway]] centre on the [[West Coast Main Line]] with connections to the east. At one time seven companies used [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle Citadel railway station]]. Before the building of the Citadel railway station the city had several other railway stations, including [[Carlisle London Road railway station|London Road railway station]]. Carlisle had the largest railway marshalling yard in Europe, Kingmoor, which, reduced in size, is operational and used by railfreight companies.

The [[Strand Road drill hall, Carlisle|Strand Road drill hall]] opened in 1874.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Carlisle |url=http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Cumbria/TownCarlisle.htm |access-date=1 September 2017 |publisher=The Drill Hall Project |archive-date=2 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170902044236/http://www.drillhalls.org/Counties/Cumbria/TownCarlisle.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Modern history===
[[File:Carlisle city centre - geograph.org.uk - 1731484.jpg|thumb|1950s Botchergate in Carlisle]]
At the start of the 20th century, the population had grown to over 45,000. Transport was improved by the [[City of Carlisle Electric Tramways]] from 1900 until 1931, and the first cinema was built in 1906. In 1912, the boundaries of Carlisle were extended to include Botcherby in the east and Stanwix in the north.<ref name="localhistories">{{Cite web |title=A History of Carlisle |url=http://www.localhistories.org/carlisle.html |access-date=4 May 2010 |publisher=Local histories |archive-date=15 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615063026/http://localhistories.org/carlisle.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Carlisle was subject to the decline in the [[textile industry]] experienced throughout Britain as new machinery made labour unnecessary. In 1916, during the [[First World War]], the [[British government|government]] took over the [[public house]]s and [[brewery|breweries]] in Carlisle because of drunkenness among construction and munitions workers from the munitions factory at [[HM Factory, Gretna|Gretna]].

During the Second World War, Carlisle hosted over 5,000 evacuees, many of whom arrived from Newcastle upon Tyne and the surrounding towns.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Evacuees |url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/hstchg/evacuees.htm |access-date=3 March 2018 |website=Holme St Cuthbert Local History Group |archive-date=22 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180722230918/http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/hstchg/evacuees.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==City centre==
Carlisle is the only city in Cumbria. The city centre is largely pedestrianised and the Lanes shopping centre is home to around 75 shops.

Carlisle has a compact historic centre with a [[castle]], [[cathedral]] and semi-intact [[Carlisle city walls|city walls]], as well as other medieval buildings including the [[Carlisle Guildhall|Guildhall]] and [[Carlisle Tithe Barn|Tithe Barn]]. The [[Carlisle Citadel|Citadel towers]], which until 2016 also served as offices for Cumbria County Council, were designed by [[Thomas Telford]], with the eastern tower incorporating part of the 16th-century building.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nisi Prius Courthouse, Associated Offices and Gate Arch, Carlisle, Cumbria |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-386723-nisi-prius-courthouse-associated-offices |access-date=7 April 2017 |archive-date=20 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220132406/http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-386723-nisi-prius-courthouse-associated-offices |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="VisitCumbria">[http://www.visitcumbria.com/car/carcitdl.htm Visit Cumbria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140713002932/http://www.visitcumbria.com/car/carcitdl.htm |date=13 July 2014 }} Carlisle Citadel</ref> The first Citadel building was a Tudor fortification replacing the medieval Englishgate, designed by the [[Moravia]]n military engineer [[Stefan von Haschenperg]] in 1541.<ref>Colvin, Howard, ed., ''The History of the King's Works'', vol. 4 part 2, (1982), 670-1.</ref> Next to the Citadel is [[Carlisle railway station]], designed by [[William Tite]] in the neo-Tudor style, considered by [[Historic England]] to be among the most important early railway stations in England.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Citadel Station, Carlisle, Cumbria |url=http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-386689-citadel-station-cumbria |access-date=7 April 2017 |archive-date=20 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220131742/http://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/en-386689-citadel-station-cumbria |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=4 December 2014 |title=10 Great English Railway Stations |url=https://heritagecalling.com/2014/12/04/10-great-english-railway-stations/ |access-date=7 April 2017 |archive-date=5 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105234344/https://heritagecalling.com/2014/12/04/10-great-english-railway-stations/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Governance==
[[File:Carlisle Council Offices.jpg|thumb|[[Carlisle Civic Centre]] in the city centre]]

===Historical===
Carlisle has held [[City status in the United Kingdom|city status]] since the [[Middle Ages]] and a [[borough constituency]] or [[parliamentary borough]] for centuries, at one time returning two MPs. In 1835 it became a [[municipal borough]] which was promoted to [[county borough]] status in 1914. The city's boundaries have changed several times since 1835, most notably between 1974 and 2023, when under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] the city and county borough and the [[Border Rural District]] were abolished and new enlarged [[City of Carlisle]] [[non-metropolitan district]] was created within the newly formed administrative county of [[Cumbria]].

The municipal borough contained several [[civil parish]]es or parts of parishes but these were merged into a single civil parish of Carlisle in 1904. The civil parish was abolished on 1 April 1974,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ukbmd.org.uk/reg/districts/carlisle.html |title=Carlisle Registration District |publisher=UKBMD |accessdate=1 January 2022 |archive-date=30 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211230182131/https://www.ukbmd.org.uk/reg/districts/carlisle.html |url-status=live }}</ref> although parts of the urban fringe are in the parishes of [[Stanwix Rural]], Kingmoor and [[St Cuthbert Without]]. Carlisle unsuccessfully applied to become a [[Lord Mayor]]alty in 2002. Carlisle City Council had its headquarters at the 1960s Civic Centre in Rickergate, the tallest building in the city.

At the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 census]], the population of Carlisle was 71,773, with 100,734 living in the district. In the 2011 census, the city's population had risen to 75,306, with 107,524 in the district.<ref>{{Cite web |last=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=7 September 2013 |title=Carlisle Facts |url=http://www.cityofcarlisle.co.uk/facts.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304094709/http://www.cityofcarlisle.co.uk/facts.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 |access-date=12 October 2013}}</ref>

On 1 April 2023 the City of Carlisle local government district was abolished, and the boundaries of the City of Carlisle were redefined to cover the following wards: Belah and Kingmoor, Botcherby and Harraby North, Cathedral and Castle, Currock and Upperby, Denton Holme and Morton South, Harraby South and Parklands, Newtown and Morton North, Sandsfield and Morton West and Stanwix and Houghton.

Charter trustees were formed from the councillors that cover the said areas. They act as appropriate bodies in which historic rights and privileges of Carlisle, including the mayoralty will continue until a governance review will determine the need of a [[city council]].

===Parliament===
The current member of Parliament is [[Julie Minns]], representing the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

Carlisle used to be within the North West England constituency of the [[European Parliament]].

===Former county council===
[[File:Cumbria County Councils new HQ (geograph 5290723).jpg|thumb|[[Cumbria House]]]]
Carlisle elected 18 county councillors to the former Cumbria County Council.<ref>{{Cite web |title=County councillors |url=http://www.cumbria.gov.uk/councillordata/db/district.asp |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428034005/http://www.cumbria.gov.uk/councillordata/db/district.asp |archive-date=28 April 2009}}</ref> Its headquarters were located at [[Cumbria House]] on Botchergate.

===Former district council===
{{See also|City of Carlisle|Carlisle City Council elections}}
Until April 2023 Carlisle was governed by a [[non-metropolitan district|district council]], Carlisle City Council and a County Council, Cumbria County Council. After the 2019 elections the Conservative Party ran a minority administration on the district council with the support of the Independents. The district council covered a large rural area with many villages and towns including [[Dalston, Cumbria|Dalston]], [[Brampton, Carlisle, Cumbria|Brampton]], [[Longtown, Cumbria|Longtown]], [[Wetheral]], [[Bewcastle]] and [[Scotby]].

===Unitary authority===
[[Cumberland Council]], the local authority for [[Cumberland (district)|Cumberland]], is a [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]], having the powers of a non-metropolitan county and district council combined. It operated as a shadow authority until taking up its powers on 1 April 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2022/9780348231359 |title=The Cumbria (Structural Changes) Order 2022 |access-date=9 May 2022 |archive-date=14 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220414164407/https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2022/9780348231359 |url-status=live }}</ref> Cumberland Council replaced Cumbria County Council, [[Allerdale Borough Council]], Carlisle City Council and [[Copeland Borough Council]].

===Climate===
Carlisle experiences an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''). In January 2005 Carlisle was hit by strong gales and heavy rain, and on Saturday 8 January 2005 all roads into Carlisle were closed owing to severe [[flood]]ing, the worst since 1822, which caused three deaths.<ref>{{Cite news |date=8 January 2005 |title=Carlisle 'cut off' by flood water |work=[[BBC]] News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/4157381.stm |access-date=31 December 2009 |archive-date=28 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230428053812/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/cumbria/4157381.stm |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4156017.stm "Floods leave homes without power"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124050806/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4156017.stm |date=24 January 2008 }} at BBC News – 8 January 2005, 23:31 UTC</ref> Even worse flooding than in 2005 affected Carlisle between 4 and 6 December 2015. During this time, nearly 36 hours of incessant rainfall breached flood defences and left several areas submerged – including Bitts Park, Hardwicke Circus and Warwick Road. This left the Sands Centre (and the nearby Shell petrol station and Bitts Park), marooned from the rest of the city. As several other areas of Cumbria were also badly affected (particularly Appleby and Wigton), all trains to Scotland were postponed indefinitely, with trains on the West Coast Mainline going no further than Preston, as nearby Lancaster suffered flooding and problems with electricity supply. Prime Minister [[David Cameron]] visited the city on 7 December 2015 to assess the damage, having earlier called an emergency Cobra meeting.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}}

===Divisions and suburbs===
[[File:Warwick Road, Carlisle - geograph.org.uk - 196319.jpg|thumb|Warwick Road serves as one of the main routes into the centre of Carlisle.]]
In the north of Carlisle are the suburbs of Kingstown, Lowry Hill and Moorville, formerly part of the parish of Kingmoor. To the south of them are [[Stanwix]], Edentown, Etterby, St Ann's Hill and Belah which were added to Carlisle in 1912. The parish of [[Stanwix Rural]] exists but only includes a small part of Carlisle's urban area, [[Whiteclosegate]].

To the immediate south of Stanwix is the River Eden. On the opposite bank is the city centre bounded on the west by the West Coast Main Railway line and the River Caldew. In the past industry flourished on the banks of the River Caldew, especially [[Denton Holme]] and Caldewgate on the west bank and Wapping, around the former Metal Box works, on the east. West of Caldewgate and north of Denton Holme the suburbs of Newtown, Morton, Sandsfield Park, Longsowerby, [[Raffles, Cumbria|Raffles]] and [[Belle Vue, Cumbria|Belle Vue]] developed in the late 19th and 20th centuries.

The eastern side of the city centre developed in the 19th century into a more affluent area along the main [[A69 road (Great Britain)|A69 road]]. It links with the former village of [[Botcherby]] to which a large council estate was added in the mid-20th century and later still Durranhill Housing Estate.

South of the city centre is the Botchergate/St Nicholas area of late Victorian terraced housing similar to that found in Denton Holme and Caldewgate. The Botchergate East area until recently had older slum dwellings.

To the south west of Botchergate and St Nicholas are the former villages now suburbs of [[Upperby]] and [[Currock]]. The urban area spills over the former county borough boundary into [[Blackwell, Carlisle|Blackwell]] and [[Durdar]] in the civil parish of [[St Cuthbert Without]].

Between Upperby and Botcherby is Harraby, a former village once part of St Cuthbert Without and the largest suburb of Carlisle. Harraby is subdivided into Harraby East, New Harraby, Harraby Green, Old Harraby, Petteril Bank and the Durranhill Industrial Estate. Adjoining Harraby to the south but outside the former borough boundary is the hamlet of [[Carleton, Carlisle|Carleton]].

==Transport==

[[File:Carlisle railway station - Cumbria - England - 2005-06-25.jpg|thumb|[[Carlisle railway station]]]]
Carlisle became a major [[railway]] centre with, at one time, seven different companies using [[Carlisle railway station|Carlisle Citadel railway station]]. Prior to the building of the Citadel railway station, Carlisle had several railway stations, including [[Carlisle London Road railway station|London Road railway station]]. Carlisle also used to have the largest railway marshaling yard in Europe, at [[Carlisle Kingmoor Marshalling Yard|Kingmoor]], which, although reduced in size, is still very much operational and used by railfreight companies like [[Colas Rail]], [[DB Cargo UK]], [[Freightliner Group|Freightliner]] and very occasionally [[Direct Rail Services]].

Today, [[Carlisle railway station]] is a principal station on the [[West Coast Main Line]]. Other lines branch off to [[Newcastle railway station|Newcastle]], along the [[Tyne Valley line]]; [[Leeds railway station|Leeds]], along the [[Settle and Carlisle line]]; [[Glasgow Central railway station|Glasgow Central]], via [[Dumfries railway station|Dumfries]] along the [[Glasgow South Western Line]] which connects [[Ayr railway station|Ayr]] and [[Stranraer railway station|Stranraer]] for the [[Stena Line]] ferry to [[Port of Belfast]] or [[P&O Ferries]] to [[Larne Harbour railway station|Larne Harbour]]; and west Cumbria along the [[Cumbrian Coast line]] to [[Whitehaven railway station|Whitehaven]], [[Barrow-in-Furness railway station|Barrow-in-Furness]] and [[Lancaster railway station|Lancaster]].

==Trade and industry==
[[File:McVities factory, Caldewgate - geograph.org.uk - 960979.jpg|thumb|McVities factory, Caldewgate]]
Carlisle became an industrial city in the 19th and early 20th centuries with many textile mills, engineering works and food manufacturers opening up mostly in the [[Denton Holme]], Caldewgate and Wapping areas which lie in the Caldew Valley area of Carlisle. (One such manufacturer located in the Denton Holme area was Ferguson Printers, a large textile printing factory that had stood for many years before its closure in the early 1990s). In the early 19th century, a [[canal]] was dug connecting Caldewgate with the sea at [[Port Carlisle]]. The canal was later filled in and became a railway line.

Carlisle was served by two electricity [[Carlisle power stations|power stations]]. James Street station was built by the corporation and operated from 1899 until 1927. Willow Holme power station, north west of the city, was built and operated by the corporation from 1923 until nationalisation of the industry in 1948. It was closed down in 1980 and demolished in 1988.

Famous firms that were founded or had factories in Carlisle included [[Carr's|Carr's of Carlisle]] (now part of [[United Biscuits]]), [[Kangol]], Metal Box (now part of [[Crown Holdings]]) and Cowans Sheldon. Cowans Sheldon originated in the city in the mid 19th century and became one of the world's most important railway and marine engineering firms, manufacturing finally ceased in Carlisle in 1987. Others include the construction firms of [[John Laing plc|John Laing]] and Story Contracting. Pirelli Carlisle opened in 1969.<ref>{{Cite web |date=10 April 2019 |title=HRH The Prince of Wales celebrates 50 years of Pirelli Carlisle |url=https://www.pirelli.com/global/en-ww/life/hrh-the-prince-of-wales-celebrates-50-years-of-pirelli-carlisle |access-date= |website=[[Pirelli]] |archive-date=27 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220127194539/https://www.pirelli.com/global/en-ww/life/hrh-the-prince-of-wales-celebrates-50-years-of-pirelli-carlisle |url-status=live }}</ref>

The hauliers [[Eddie Stobart Logistics]] who were founded in nearby [[Hesket Newmarket]] and were once part of the [[Stobart Group]], had their HQ in Carlisle. Although they no longer have their HQ in Carlisle they still employ staff in the city. Robsons Border Transport Limited, J & W Watt Limited and F Brown (Carlisle) Limited, all substantial road hauliers, had their HQ in Carlisle.

Until 2004, Carlisle's biggest employer was [[Cavaghan & Gray]], which became part of [[Northern Foods]] and was subsequently acquired by [[2 Sisters Food Group]] which operated from two sites in the Harraby area of Carlisle producing chilled foods for major supermarket chains. The London Road site closed in 2005 with the loss of almost 700 jobs as production was transferred to the nearby Eastern Way site or other factories around the UK.

There are various light industrial estates and business parks located on the fringes of Carlisle and on former industrial sites close to the city centre. The largest being the Kingstown Industrial Estate, which is located just off the [[A7 road]] near to the [[M6 motorway]].

On 28 March 2005, Carlisle was granted [[Fairtrade City]] status.<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 October 2015 |title=Carlisle celebrates 10 year anniversary of 'Fairtrade City' status |url=https://www.itv.com/news/border/update/2015-10-21/carlisle-celebrates-10-year-anniversary-of-fairtrade-city-status/ |access-date=19 June 2019 |website=[[ITV News]] |archive-date=19 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619221047/https://www.itv.com/news/border/update/2015-10-21/carlisle-celebrates-10-year-anniversary-of-fairtrade-city-status/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Media===
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2022}}
From 1961 to 2009, Carlisle was home to [[Border Television]] which served Cumbria, southern Scotland, the Isle of Man and parts of Northumberland.

Initially based at studios in the Harraby area of the city, the station was controversially merged with [[ITV Tyne Tees]] in 2009 as part of wide-ranging cutbacks to ITV's regional output.

As of 2009, ITV Border's news and sales operations are based at offices in the north of the city, although production of its nightly news programme, ''Lookaround'', is based at Tyne Tees' Gateshead studios.

As of 2014, ITV Border is again producing a full regional news service, along with two hours a week of current affairs and features programming, aimed specifically at southern Scotland.

On [[BBC One]], the city is served by the regional programme, ''[[BBC Look North (North East and Cumbria)|BBC Look North]]''. 

Television signals are received from the [[Caldbeck transmitting station|Caldbeck]] TV transmitter.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://ukfree.tv/transmitters/tv/Caldbeck | title=Caldbeck (Cumbria, England) Full Freeview transmitter | date=May 2004 }}</ref>

As a frontier town for over a millennium and a half, Carlisle is a military city. It is the most besieged place in the British Isles, having been besieged at least ten times, and has garrisoned troops for most of its history.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Carlisle Castle History and Research |url=http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/carlisle-castle/history-and-research/ |access-date=5 May 2011 |publisher=English heritage |archive-date=4 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110704140728/http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/daysout/properties/carlisle-castle/history-and-research/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Cumbria's County regiment, the [[Border Regiment]] made its headquarters at [[Carlisle Castle]].

===RAF Carlisle===
{{Main|RAF Carlisle}}
[[RAF Carlisle]] also known as '''14 MU''' was located at Kingstown near the present-day [[Asda]]. The station closed in 1996 after nearly sixty years in a variety of roles. First established as '''RAF Kingstown''' in 1938, it was originally a bomber station, then one of the RAF's Elementary Flying Training Schools and latterly a post-war storage facility.

===RAF Spadeadam===

The largest RAF station by area in the country and one of only two [[electronic warfare]] ranges in Europe, [[RAF Spadeadam]] is located outside the City of Carlisle but maintains strong links with the local community; in 2018, it was awarded the Freedom of the City of Carlisle.<ref>{{cite news |title=RAF Spadeadam to receive Freedom of the City of Carlisle in celebration of RAF100 |url=https://cumbriacrack.com/2018/05/25/raf-spadeadam-to-receive-freedom-of-the-city-of-carlisle-in-celebration-of-raf100/ |access-date=23 August 2021 |work=Cumbria Crack |date=25 May 2018 |archive-date=11 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210711011827/https://cumbriacrack.com/2018/05/25/raf-spadeadam-to-receive-freedom-of-the-city-of-carlisle-in-celebration-of-raf100/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Royal Observer Corps, Carlisle Group===
During the [[Second World War]] the air raid warning organisation No 32 Group Carlisle [[Royal Observer Corps]] operated in the city centre controlled from RAF Kingstown. The association with Kingstown developed further in 1962 when the ROC ceased its aircraft spotting role for the RAF and took on a new role plotting nuclear explosions and warning the public of radioactive fallout for the [[United Kingdom Warning and Monitoring Organisation]] (UKWMO).<ref>{{Cite web |title=ROC role |url=http://www.cybertrn.demon.co.uk/atomic/ukwmo/ukwmo.htm |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514094956/http://www.cybertrn.demon.co.uk/atomic/ukwmo/ukwmo.htm |archive-date=14 May 2008 |access-date=7 April 2017}}</ref> A new administration building and a protected, hardened Nuclear Reporting bunker was built at RAF Carlisle.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Royal Observer Corps |url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/roc/group_hq.html |access-date=1 January 2022 |first=Nick |last=Catford |website=Subterrania Britanica |archive-date=25 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025003958/http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/roc/group_hq.html |url-status=live }}</ref>{{Failed verification|date=January 2022}} The nuclear bunker was a standard above-ground structure and both the bunker and headquarters hutting were on a separate site at Crindledyke outside the main gates of RAF Carlisle. The Carlisle group was redesignated no 22 Group ROC.

The ROC constructed a smaller nuclear reporting post, Kingstown post (OS ref:NY 3837 5920), on the main RAF Carlisle site. The post was an underground protected bunker for a crew of three observers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nuclear Monitoring Posts – Subterranea Britannica |url=https://www.subbrit.org.uk/categories/nuclear-monitoring-posts/ |website=www.subbrit.org.uk |access-date=19 May 2020 |archive-date=19 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200419222654/https://www.subbrit.org.uk/categories/nuclear-monitoring-posts/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The headquarters bunker accommodated an operational crew of around 100 with dormitory and canteen facilities an operations room and life support plant.

The Royal Observer Corps was stood down and its parent organisation the UKWMO was disbanded in December 1995 after the end of the [[Cold War]] and as a result of recommendations in the governments [[Options for Change]] review of UK defence. The ROC buildings were demolished in 1996 and replaced by a cellphone communications mast. The foundations of the nuclear bunker can still be partially seen outlined in the concreted yard, which also contains the Air Training Corps hut during recent further development of the site.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Subterranea Britannica: Research Study Group: Sites: Carlisle |url=http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/c/carlisle/ |access-date=7 April 2017 |archive-date=15 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170615153436/http://www.subbrit.org.uk/rsg/sites/c/carlisle/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Arthurian legend ===
{{Main|Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight}}
There are many legends and folkloric stories about the city during the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], such as the [[Sir Gawain and the Carle of Carlisle]], about the nephew of [[King Arthur]] and the "free man" of the city.

In a 14th-century poem, legend has it that Sir Gawain, one of the Knights of the Round Table, stayed at the [[Carlisle Castle|Castle of Carlisle]] while on a hunting expedition in the haunted [[Inglewood Forest]]. He then slept with the Carle's wife and killed him. This poem has strong parallels with another 14th century poem about Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. The story has since been re-adapted many times, most recently in films from [[Gawain and the Green Knight (film)|1973]], [[Sword of the Valiant|1984]] and [[The Green Knight (film)|2021]].

By some accounts, Carlisle is also none other than [[Camelot]], the mythical seat of King Arthur's court.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.toeuropeandbeyond.com/king-arthur-locations/#carlisle-castle |title=The legend of King Arthur: the most significant locations in Wales and England |date=3 May 2017 |language=en |access-date=3 August 2022 |archive-date=3 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220803103936/https://www.toeuropeandbeyond.com/king-arthur-locations/#carlisle-castle |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Curse of Carlisle ===
In local folklore, the ''Curse of Carlisle'' is a 16th-century [[curse]] that is said to have been invoked by Archbishop Dunbar of [[Glasgow]] in 1525 upon cross-border families, known as the [[Border Reivers]], who lived by stealing cattle and pillaging. For the millennium celebrations, the local council commissioned a 14-tonne granite artwork inscribed with all 1,069 words of the curse. Following the installation of the stone, Carlisle suffered floods, foot-and-mouth disease, job losses and a "goal famine" for the football team.<ref name="witch" /> In response to this, the city council considered removing the stone; however, Kevin Carlyon, the self-titled "high priest of the British [[white witch]]es", proclaimed that such actions would give the curse more power. He commented that: "A curse can only work if people believe in it. I think at the moment the sculpture is a nice piece of history, but if the council destroys it, they would be showing their belief in the curse."<ref name="witch">{{Cite news |date=8 March 2005 |title=Witch warns of Curse Stone power |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/4328259.stm |access-date=31 December 2009 |archive-date=11 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011210433/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/cumbria/4328259.stm |url-status=live }}</ref>
