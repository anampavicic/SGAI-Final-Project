It is the country's political, cultural, economic, and academic centre. Skopje lies in the [[Skopje Basin]].

[[Scupi]] is attested for the first time in the second century AD as a city in Roman [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Syme |first1=Ronald |last2=Birley |first2=Anthony |title=The Provincial at Rome: And, Rome and the Balkans 80BC-AD14 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D5IxWxCgFFwC&q=scupi+dardania+roman&pg=PA129 |publisher=University of Exeter Press |date=1 January 1999 |isbn=9780859896320 |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Mócsy |first=András |title=Pannonia and Upper Moesia: A History of the Middle Danube Provinces of the Roman Empire |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6L49AAAAIAAJ&q=scupi+&pg=PA65 |publisher=Routledge & K. Paul |date=1 January 1974 |isbn=9780710077141 |via=Google Books}}</ref> When the [[Roman Empire]] was divided into eastern and western halves in 395 AD, Scupi came under [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] rule from [[Constantinople]]. During much of the [[Early Middle Ages|early medieval]] period, the town was contested between the Byzantines and the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], whose capital it was between 972 and 992. In 1004, when it was seized by the Byzantine Empire, the city became a centre of a new [[Theme (Byzantine district)|province]] called [[Theme of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]]. From 1282, the town was part of the [[Serbian Empire]], of which it was the capital from 1346 to 1371. 

In 1392, Skopje was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Turk]]s, who called it {{lang|ota-Latn|Üsküb}} ({{lang|ota|اسکوب}}).{{Efn|This name was also in use in English for a time.}} The town stayed under Ottoman control for over 500 years, serving as the capital of the [[Sanjak|pashasanjak]] of {{lang|ota-Latn|Üsküp}} and later the [[Vilayet of Kosovo]]. Its central position in the [[Ottoman Balkans]] made it a significant centre of commerce and administration during the Ottoman era. In 1912, it was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] during the [[Balkan Wars]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FTw3lEqi2-oC&dq=serbia++annexed++1912&pg=PA40 40]}} 

During [[World War I]] the city was seized by the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]], and, after the war, it became part of the newly formed [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] as the capital of [[Vardarska Banovina]]. In [[World War II]], the city was again captured by Bulgaria and in 1945 became the capital of [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|SR Macedonia]], a [[federated state]] within [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].<ref>John B., Bell, Martin, ''Conflict in the former Yugoslavia: an Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO, 1998, p. 270, {{ISBN|0874369355}}.</ref> The city developed rapidly, but this was interrupted in 1963 when it was hit by [[1963 Skopje earthquake|a disastrous earthquake]].

Skopje is on the upper course of the [[Vardar]] River and is on a major north–south [[Balkans|Balkan]] route between [[Belgrade]] and [[Athens]]. It is a centre for the chemical, timber, textile, leather, printing, and metal-processing industries. Industrial development of the city has been accompanied by development of the trade, logistics, and banking sectors, as well as an emphasis on the fields of transportation, culture and sport. According to the last official census from 2021, Skopje had a population of 526,502 inhabitants.<ref name="stats2"/>

[[File:Skoplje 1912.jpg|thumb|left|Serbian troops overseeing the city's renaming from "Üsküb" to "Skoplje" following Serbia's annexation of [[Vardar Macedonia]] in 1912]]

The city is attested for the first name in ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geography]]'' by [[Ptolemy]] {{circa|150 AD}} as one of the cities of Roman [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]]. Ptolemy describes the city in Latin as ''Scupi'' and ancient Greek as ''Σκοῦποι''. The toponym likely belongs to a group of similar [[Illyrian language|Illyrian]] toponyms which have been transmitted to Slavic languages in the same way as the modern [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] toponym ''Skopje'': ''Skoplje'' and ''Uskoplje'' in Bosnia, ''Uskoplje'' in Dalmatia (Croatia).{{sfn|Duridanov|1975|pp=18–19}} 

''Shkup'', the name of the city in [[Albanian language|Albanian]], developed directly from Roman-era ''Scupi'' in agreement with the Albanian phonological development, the basis of evidence of an earlier Albanian settlement in the area.<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Curtis|first=Matthew Cowan|title=Slavic-Albanian Language Contact, Convergence, and Coexistence|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=osu1338406907|publisher=The Ohio State University|year=2012|page=45|quote=Again the evidence of an earlier Albanian settlement in Macedonian territories relies on the phonological development of particular locations.

Chapter 2 in Noel Malcolm's Kosovo, a short history (Macmillan, London, 1998, pp. 22-40) - The evidence is in fact very mixed; some of the Albanian forms (of both urban and rural names) suggest transmission via Slav, but others -including the towns of Shkodra, Drisht, Lezha, Shkup (Skopje) and perhaps Shtip (Stip, southeast of Skopje) - follow the pattern of continuous Albanian development from the Latin. [48] (One common objection to this argument, claiming that 'sc-' in Latin should have turned into 'h-', not 'shk-' in Albanian, rests on a chronological error, and can be disregarded.) [49] There are also some fairly convincing derivations of Slav names for rivers in northern Albania - particularly the Bojana (Alb.: Buena) and the Drim (Alb.: Drin) - which suggest that the Slavs must have acquired their names from the Albanian forms.

When [[Vardar Macedonia]] was annexed by the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] in 1912, the city officially became "Skoplje" ({{Lang-sr-Cyrl|Скопље}}) and many languages adopted this name. To reflect local pronunciation, the city's name was eventually spelled as "Skopje" ({{lang-mk|Скопје}}) after the [[Second World War]], when standard [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] became the official language of the new [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]].

=== Topography ===

Skopje is in the north of the country, in the centre of the [[Balkan peninsula]], and halfway between [[Belgrade]] and [[Athens]]. The city was built in the Skopje valley, oriented on a west-east axis, along the course of the [[Vardar]] river, which flows into the [[Aegean Sea]] in Greece. The valley is approximately {{cvt|20|km|abbr=off}} wide<ref name="tourism">{{cite web |url=http://www.macedoniatourism.gov.mk/freeTime.aspx?q=uKZfRLQMSvIy7ig7VCbGlw==#&&hp=L75tfs0nVNv%2bI7mU8aucLg%3d%3d |title=Nature of the region of Skopje |publisher=Tourist office of Macedonia |year=2009 |access-date=26 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110914052819/http://www.macedoniatourism.gov.mk/freeTime.aspx?q=uKZfRLQMSvIy7ig7VCbGlw==#&&hp=L75tfs0nVNv%2bI7mU8aucLg%3d%3d |archive-date=14 September 2011}}</ref> and it is limited by several mountain ranges to the north and south. These ranges limit the urban expansion of Skopje, which spreads along the Vardar and the [[Serava]], a small river which comes from the north.

=== Hydrography ===

The [[Vardar]] river, which flows through Skopje, is at approximately {{cvt|60|km|abbr=off}} from its source near [[Gostivar]]. In Skopje, its average discharge is 51 m<sup>3</sup>/s, with a wide amplitude depending on seasons, between 99.6 m<sup>3</sup>/s in May and 18.7 m<sup>3</sup>/s in July. The water temperature is between 4.6&nbsp;°C in January and 18.1&nbsp;°C in July.<ref name="vardar">{{cite web |url=http://www.kuke.com.pl/download.php?id=9 |title=Combined Cycle Co-Generation Power Plant Project, Skopje, Environmental Assessment Report |publisher=TE-TO AD SKOPJE |year=2006 |access-date=6 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090816180417/http://www.kuke.com.pl/download.php?id=9 |archive-date=16 August 2009}}</ref>

Several rivers meet the Vardar within the city boundaries. The largest is the [[Treska]], which is {{cvt|130|km|abbr=off}} long. It crosses the [[Matka Canyon]] before reaching the Vardar on the western extremity of the City of Skopje. The [[Lepenac]], coming from [[Kosovo]], flows into the Vardar on the northwestern end of the urban area. The Serava, also coming from the North, had flowed through the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]] until the 1960s when it was diverted towards the West because its waters were very polluted. Originally, it met the Vardar close to the seat of the [[Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. Nowadays, it flows into the Vardar near the ruins of [[Scupi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://star.vest.com.mk/default.asp?id=40399&idg=3&idb=604&rubrika=Revija |title=Одмаздата на Серава |year=2001 |publisher=Vest |author=Risto Ḱorstošev |access-date=6 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023061721/http://star.vest.com.mk/default.asp?id=40399&idg=3&idb=604&rubrika=Revija |archive-date=23 October 2013}}</ref> [[Marko's River|Markova Reka]], which originates in Mount [[Vodno]], meets the Vardar at the eastern extremity of the city. These three rivers are less than {{cvt|70|km|abbr=off}} long.<ref name="figures"/>

The City of Skopje incorporates two artificial lakes, on the Treska. The lake Matka is the result of the construction of a dam in the Matka Canyon in the 1930s, and the Treska lake was dug for leisure purposes in 1978.<ref name="figures"/> Three small natural lakes can be found near [[Smilkovci]], on the northeastern edge of the urban area.

The river [[Vardar]] historically caused many floods, such as in 1962, when its outflow reached 1110 m<sup>3</sup>/s<sup>−1</sup>.<ref name="vardar"/> Several works have been carried out since Byzantine times to limit the risks, and since the construction of the [[Kozjak Hydro Power Plant|Kozjak dam]] on the Treska in 1994, the flood risk is close to zero.<ref name="kozjak">{{cite web |url=http://www.jasen.com.mk/Default.aspx?id=1703cd5c-b351-44f8-a60d-8108b7a76e5a |title=Lake Kozjak |author=Jasen |year=2010 |publisher=Government of the Republic of Macedonia |access-date=27 February 2011}}</ref>

The subsoil contains a large [[water table]] which is alimented by the Vardar river and functions as an underground river. Under the table lies an [[aquifer]] contained in [[marl]]. The water table is 4 to 12 m under the ground and 4 to 144 m deep. Several wells collect its waters but most of the drinking water used in Skopje comes from a [[karst]]ic spring in [[Rašče]], west of the city.<ref name="nature"/>

=== Geology ===

The Skopje valley is bordered on the West by the [[Šar Mountains]], on the South by the [[Jakupica]] range, on the East by hills belonging to the [[Osogovo]] range, and on the North by the [[Skopska Crna Gora]]. Mount [[Vodno]], the highest point inside the city limits, is 1066 m high and is part of the [[Jakupica]] range.<ref name="figures"/>

Although Skopje is built on the foot of Mount Vodno, the urban area is mostly flat. It comprises several minor hills, generally covered with woods and parks, such as Gazi Baba hill (325 m), Zajčev Rid (327 m), the foothills of Mount Vodno (the smallest are between 350 and 400 m high) and the promontory on which [[Skopje Fortress]] is built.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.build.mk/docs/GUP-Transport.jpg |title=GUP Transport |publisher=Build.mk |access-date=6 October 2012}}</ref>

The Skopje valley belongs to the Vardar geotectonic region, the subsoil of which is formed of [[Neogene]] and [[Quaternary]] deposits. The substratum is made of [[Pliocene]] deposits including [[sandstone]], [[marl]], and various conglomerates. It is covered by a first layer of Quaternary sands and silt, which is between 70 and 90 m deep. The layer is topped by a much smaller layer of clay, sand, silt, and gravel, carried by the [[Vardar]] river. It is between 1.5 and 5.2 m deep.<ref name="ohis">{{cite web |url=http://ozoneunit.gov.mk/pops/Ohis.pdf |title=Macedonian Ministry of Environment and Physical Planning, OHIS Site Remediation Project Conceptual Design, 2010 |website=ozoneunit.gov.mk |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140428174642/http://ozoneunit.gov.mk/pops/Ohis.pdf |archive-date=28 April 2014}}</ref>

In some areas, the subsoil is [[karst]]ic. It led to the formation of canyons, such as the [[Matka Canyon]], which is surrounded by ten caves. They are between 20 and 176 m deep.<ref name="macedonia.co.uk">{{cite web |url=http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?idp=modules&page=426 |title=Matka Canyon |website=macedonia.co.uk}}</ref>

Precipitation is relatively low due to the pronounced [[rain shadow]] of the [[Accursed Mountains]] to the northwest, being significantly less than what is received on the Adriatic Sea coast at the same latitude. The summers are long, hot and relatively dry with low humidity. Skopje's average July high is {{cvt|32|°C|0}}. On average Skopje sees 88 days above {{cvt|30|°C|0}} each year, and 10.2 days above {{cvt|35.0|°C|0}} every year. 

Winters are short, relatively cold and wet. Snowfalls are common in the winter period, but heavy snow accumulation is rare and the snowcover lasts only for a few hours or a few days if heavy. In summer, temperatures are usually above {{cvt|31|°C|0}} and sometimes above {{cvt|40|°C|0}}. In spring and autumn, the temperatures range from {{cvt|15|to|24|C|F|0}}. In winter, the day temperatures are roughly in the range from {{cvt|5-10|°C|0}}, but at nights they often fall below {{cvt|0|°C|0}} and sometimes below {{cvt|-10|°C|0}}. Typically, temperatures throughout one year range from −13&nbsp;°C to 39&nbsp;°C. Occurrences of precipitation are evenly distributed throughout the year, being heaviest from October to December, and from April to June.

=== Environment ===
The City of Skopje encompasses various natural environments and its fauna and flora are rich. However, it is threatened by the intensification of agriculture and urban extension. The largest protected area within the city limits is Mount Vodno, which is a popular leisure destination. A cable car connects its peak to the downtown, and many pedestrian paths run through its woods. Other large natural spots include the [[Matka Canyon]].<ref name="nature"/>

The city itself comprises several parks and gardens amounting to 4,361 hectares. Among these are the City Park (Gradski Park), built by the Ottoman Turks at the beginning of the 20th century; Žena Borec Park, in front of the Parliament; the university arboretum; and Gazi Baba forest. Many streets and boulevards are planted with trees.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.parkovi.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=585010091E61F94A93252F30545D68B9 |title=Градско Зеленило |publisher=Паркови и Зеленило |access-date=19 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115085154/http://www.parkovi.com.mk/default.asp?ItemID=585010091E61F94A93252F30545D68B9 |archive-date=15 November 2012}}</ref>

Steel processing, which is a crucial activity for the local economy, is responsible for [[soil pollution]] with heavy metals such as lead, [[zinc]] and [[cadmium]], and air pollution with [[nitrogen oxide]] and [[carbon monoxide]].<ref name="nature"/> Vehicle traffic and [[district heating]] plants are also responsible for air pollution.

Water treatment plants are being built, but much polluted water is still discharged untreated into the [[Vardar]].<ref name="nature"/> Waste is disposed of in the open-air municipal landfill site, {{cvt|15|km|abbr=off}} north of the city. Every day, it receives 1,500 m<sup>3</sup> of domestic waste and 400 m<sup>3</sup> of industrial waste. Health levels are better in Skopje than in the rest of North Macedonia, and no link has been found between the low environmental quality and the health of the residents.<ref name="security">{{cite web |url=http://www.arab-hdr.org/publications/other/undp/hdr/2001/macedonia-e.pdf |title=National Report on Human Development |year=2001 |publisher=UNDR |access-date=13 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226090232/http://www.arab-hdr.org/publications/other/undp/hdr/2001/macedonia-e.pdf |archive-date=26 December 2013}}</ref>

The urban morphology of Skopje was deeply impacted by the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|26 July 1963 earthquake]], which destroyed 80% of the city, and by the reconstruction that followed.<ref name=damages/> For instance, neighbourhoods were rebuilt in such a way that the demographic density remains low to limit the impact of potential future earthquakes.<ref name=post/>

Reconstruction following the 1963 earthquake was mainly conducted by the Polish architect [[Adolf Ciborowski]], who had already planned the reconstruction of [[Warsaw]] after [[World War II]]. Ciborowski divided the city into blocks dedicated to specific activities. The banks of the [[Vardar]] river became natural areas and parks, areas between the main boulevards were built with highrise housing and shopping centres, and the suburbs were left to individual housing and industry.<ref name="reconstruction">{{cite web |url=http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home/faculties/alss/deps/law/staff0/home.Maincontent.0014.file.tmp/No7-Skopje.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webarchive.org.uk/wayback/archive/20121217074412/http://www.anglia.ac.uk/ruskin/en/home/faculties/alss/deps/law/staff0/home.Maincontent.0014.file.tmp/No7-Skopje.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 December 2012 |title=Rebuilding Skopje |author=Robert Homes |publisher=Anglia Ruskin University, Cambridge and Chelmsford |access-date=26 February 2011}}</ref> Reconstruction had to be quick to relocate families and to relaunch the local economy.

[[File:Skopje SPOT 1114.jpg|thumb|left|Skopje as seen by the [[SPOT (satellite)|SPOT satellite]]. Mount Vodno is visible on the bottom left of the picture.]]
The south bank of the Vardar river generally comprises highrise tower blocks, including the vast Karpoš neighbourhood which was built in the 1970s west of the centre. Towards the East, the new municipality of [[Aerodrom Municipality (Skopje)|Aerodrom]] was planned in the 1980s to house 80,000 inhabitants on the site of the old airport. Between Karpoš and Aerodrom lies the city centre, rebuilt according to plans by Japanese architect [[Kenzo Tange]]. The centre is surrounded by a row of long buildings suggesting a wall ("Gradski Zid").<ref name=post/>

On the north bank, where the most ancient parts of the city lie, the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]] was restored and its surroundings were rebuilt with low-rise buildings, so as not to spoil views of the [[Skopje Fortress]]. Several institutions, including the university and the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts, were also relocated to the north bank to reduce borders between the ethnic communities. The north bank is mostly inhabited by Muslim Albanians, Turks, and Roma, whereas Christian ethnic Macedonians predominantly reside on the south bank.<ref name=reconstruction/>

The earthquake left the city with few historical monuments, apart from the Ottoman [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]], and the reconstruction, conducted between the 1960s and 1980s, turned Skopje into a [[modernist architecture|modernist]] city. At the end of the 2000s, the city centre experienced profound changes. A highly controversial<ref>{{cite news |title=The makeover that's divided a nation |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-28951171 |access-date=6 February 2017 |work=BBC News |date=30 August 2014 |last1=Launey |first1=Guy De}}</ref> urban project, "[[Skopje 2014]]", was adopted by the municipal authorities to give the city a more monumental and historical aspect, and thus to transform it into a proper national capital. Several neoclassical buildings destroyed in the 1963 earthquake were rebuilt, including the national theatre, and streets and squares were refurbished. Many other elements were also built, including fountains, statues, hotels, government buildings and bridges.

=== Urban sociology ===
[[File:Kapistec.jpg|thumb|Kapištec neighbourhood, developed during the 1970s. Some post-earthquake prefabricated houses can be seen in the foreground.]]

Skopje is an ethnically diverse city, and its urban sociology primarily depends on ethnic and religious affiliation. [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] form 66% of the city population, while [[Albanians in North Macedonia|Albanians]] and [[Roma in North Macedonia|Roma]] account respectively for 20% and 6%.<ref name="stats1"/> Each ethnic group generally restricts itself to certain areas of the city. Macedonians live south of the [[Vardar]], in areas massively rebuilt after 1963, and Muslims live on the northern side, in the oldest neighbourhoods of the city. These neighbourhoods are considered more traditional, whereas the south side evokes to Macedonians modernity and rupture from rural life.<ref name="thiesen57">{{Cite book |author=Ilká Thiessen |title=Waiting for Macedonia: Identity in a Changing World |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2007 |isbn=9781551117195 |page=57}}</ref>

The northern areas are the poorest. This is especially true for [[Topaana]], in [[Čair municipality]], and for [[Šuto Orizari municipality]], which are the two main Roma neighbourhoods. They are made of many illegal constructions not connected to electricity and water supply, which are passed from one generation to another. Topaana, close to the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]], is a very old area: it was first mentioned as a Roma neighbourhood in the beginning of the 14th century. It has between 3,000 and 5,000 inhabitants. Šuto Orizari, on the northern edge of the city, is a municipality of its own, with [[Romani language|Romani]] as its local official language. It was developed after the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|1963 earthquake]] to accommodate Roma who had lost their house.<ref name="roma"/>

The population density varies greatly from one area to another. So does the size of the living area per person. The city average was at {{cvt|19.41|m2|2|abbr=off}} per person {{As of|2002|lc=y}}, but at {{cvt|24|m2|0|abbr=off}} in [[Centar municipality (Skopje)|Centar]] on the south bank, and only {{cvt|14|m2|0|abbr=off}} in [[Čair municipality|Čair]] on the north bank. In [[Šuto Orizari municipality|Šuto Orizari]], the average was at {{cvt|13|m2|0|abbr=off}}.<ref name="stats1"/>

=== Localities and villages ===
[[File:Gorno Nerezi 2013 (1).JPG|thumb|[[Gorno Nerezi]], a village on the northern side of Mount Vodno]]

Outside of the urban area, the City of Skopje encompasses many small settlements. Some of them are becoming outer suburbs, such as [[Čento]], on the road to Belgrade, which has more than 23,000 inhabitants, and [[Dračevo, Skopje|Dračevo]], which has almost 20,000 inhabitants.<ref name="dwelling">{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/Publikacii/knigaX.pdf |title=Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in the Republic of Macedonia |year=2002 |publisher=State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia |access-date=16 October 2012}}</ref> Other large settlements are north of the city, such as Radišani, with 9,000 inhabitants,<ref name="dwelling"/> whereas smaller villages can be found on Mount Vodno or in [[Saraj municipality]], which is the most rural of the ten municipalities that form the City of Skopje.<ref name="region"/>

Some localities outside the city limits are also becoming outer suburbs, particularly in [[Ilinden municipality|Ilinden]] and [[Petrovec municipality]]. They benefit from the presence of major roads, railways, and the [[Skopje "Alexander the Great" Airport|airport]], in Petrovec.<ref name="region"/>

=== Pollution ===
[[File:Urban pollution ,Градско загадување.jpg|thumb|Pollution contributors in the area of Skopje]]

Air pollution is a serious problem in Skopje, especially in winter.<ref name="aljazeera">{{Cite web |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/skopje-europe-polluted-capital-city-190312092012504.html |title=Inside Skopje, Europe's most polluted capital city |last=Lee and Mickute |first=Joi and Viktorija |date=19 March 2019 |website=Al Jazeera}}</ref> Concentrations of certain types of [[Particulates|particulate matter]] (PM2 and PM10) are regularly over twelve times the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] recommended maximum levels. In winter, smoke regularly obscures vision and can lead to problems for drivers. Together with [[Kosovo]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[North Macedonia]] has the most polluted urban areas in Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/india/articles/delhi-most-polluted-city-in-the-world/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/india/articles/delhi-most-polluted-city-in-the-world/ |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Delhi the most polluted city in the world |last=Smith |first=Oliver |date=5 November 2019 |website=The Telegraph}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

Skopje's high levels of pollution are caused by a combination of smoke from houses, emissions from the industry, buses, and other forms of public transport, as well as from cars, and a lack of interest in caring for the environment. Central heating is often not affordable, and so households often burn firewood, as well as used car tyres, various plastic garbage, petroleum, and other possible flammable waste, which emits toxic chemicals harmful to the population, especially to children and the elderly.<ref name="aljazeera" />

The city's smog has reduced its air quality and affected the health of many of its citizens, many of whom have died from pollution-related illnesses.

An [[Application software|application]] called ''AirCare'' ('MojVozduh') has been launched by local eco-activist [[Gorjan Jovanovski]] to help citizens track pollution levels.

=== Origins ===

The rocky promontory on which [[Skopje Fortress]] stands was the first site to be settled in Skopje. The earliest vestiges of human occupation found on this site date from the [[Chalcolithic]] ([[4th millennium BC]]).<ref name="kalepre">{{cite web |url=http://www.skopskokale.com.mk/en/prehistory.php |title=Prehistoric Kale |publisher=Archaeological exavations Skopsko Kale |year=2007 |access-date=6 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304134515/http://www.skopskokale.com.mk/en/prehistory.php |archive-date=4 March 2012}}</ref>

Although the Chalcolithic settlement must have been of some significance, it declined during the [[Bronze Age]]. Archeological research suggests that the settlement always belonged to the same culture, which progressively evolved due to contacts with [[Balkan]] and [[Danube]] cultures, and later with the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. The locality eventually disappeared during the [[Iron Age]]<ref name="kaleant">{{cite web |url=http://www.skopskokale.com.mk/en/antiquty.php |title=Kale in the antiquity |publisher=Archaeological exavations Skopsko Kale |year=2007 |access-date=6 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212053952/http://www.skopskokale.com.mk/en/antiquty.php |archive-date=12 February 2012}}</ref> when [[Scupi]] emerged on Zajčev Rid hill, some {{cvt|5|km}} west of the fortress promontory.

During the Iron Age, the area of Skopje was inhabited by the [[Dardani]]. [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes lived in most of the area west of Skopje and [[Thracians|Thracian]] groups ([[Maedi]]) to the east, while [[Paeonians]] lived to the south of Skopje.{{sfn|Duridanov|1975|p=17}} The Dardanians had remained independent after the Roman conquest of [[Macedon]], and it seems most likely that Dardania lost its independence in 28 BC.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-7653/2006/0350-76530637007P.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006211424/http://www.doiserbia.nb.rs/img/doi/0350-7653/2006/0350-76530637007P.pdf |url-status=dead |title=Vladimir P.

Roman expansion east brought Scupi under Roman rule as a colony of legionnaires, mainly veterans of the [[Legio VII Claudia]] in the time of [[Domitian]] (81–96 AD). However, several legions from the [[Roman province of Macedonia]] of [[Crassus]]' army may already have been stationed there around 29–28 BC before the official imperial command was instituted.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OTgAAAAMAAJ&q=scupi%20dardania |title=The Cambridge Ancient History: The Augustan Empire, 43 B.C.-A.D. 69, 2nd ed., 1996 |last2=Cook |first2=Stanley Arthur |date=1 January 1996 |publisher=University Press |last3=Adcock |first3=Frank Ezra |first1=John Bagnell |last1=Bury |isbn=9780521264303 |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Nv6SPRKqs8C&q=scupi |title=The Illyrians |last=Wilkes |first=John |date=9 January 1996 |publisher=Wiley |via=Google Books |isbn=9780631198079}}</ref> The first mention of the city was made at that period by [[Livy]], who died in 17 AD.<ref name="history"/> Scupi first served as a military base to maintain peace in the region<ref name="provincial"/> and was officially named "Colonia Flavia Scupinorum", ''Flavia'' being the name of the [[Flavian dynasty|emperor's dynasty]].<ref name="archeology">{{cite web |url=http://www.archaeology.org/1209/features/scupi_macedonia_roman_colony_bronze_age.html |title=Burial Customs, Death on the Roman Empire's eastern frontier |author=Matthew Brunwasser |publisher=Archaeological Institute of America |year=2012 |access-date=6 October 2012 |archive-date=15 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015185034/http://www.archaeology.org/1209/features/scupi_macedonia_roman_colony_bronze_age.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> Shortly afterwards it became part of the province of [[Moesia]] during [[Augustus]]'s rule. After the division of the province by [[Domitian]] in 86 AD, Scupi was elevated to colonial status and became a seat of government within the new province of [[Moesia Superior]]. The district called [[Dardania (Roman province)|Dardania]] (within Moesia Superior) was formed into a special province by [[Diocletian]], with the capital at [[Naissus]]. In Roman times the eastern part of Dardania, from Scupi to Naissus, remained inhabited mostly by a local population, mainly of [[Thracian]] origin.{{sfn|Papazoglu|1978|p=242}}

The city population was very diverse. Engravings on tombstones suggest that only a minority of the population came from Italy, while many veterans were from [[Dalmatia]], southern [[Gaul]] and [[Syria]]. Because of the ethnic diversity of the population, [[Latin language|Latin]] maintained itself as the main language in the city at the expense of [[Ancient Greek|Greek]], which was spoken in most of the Moesian and Macedonian cities.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Pannonia and Upper Moesia |volume=4 |author=András Mócsy |publisher=Routledge |year=1974 |isbn=9780710077141 |page=117}}</ref> During the following centuries, Scupi experienced prosperity. The period from the end of the 3rd century to the end of the 4th century was particularly flourishing.<ref name="archeology"/> The first church was founded under the reign of [[Constantine the Great]] and Scupi became the seat of a diocese. In 395, following the division of the [[Roman Empire]] in two, Scupi became part of the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].<ref name="history"/>

Individuals bearing Albanian anthroponyms, be they in conjunction with Oriental/Islamic, Slavic or Christian ones, also appear in the neighbourhoods of ''Kasim Fakih'', ''Dursun Saraç'', ''Kujumxhi Mentesheli'', ''Çerep, Jandro, Stanimir, Vllah Dançu'' and ''Rela''.<ref name="Rexha 2011 167–218"/> A number of Sipahis were also of Albanian origin, with these individuals holding [[timar]]s in areas which had a Christian Albanian symbiosis with Slavic anthroponyms in the vicinity of Skopje. The defters noted that these were old were old Sipahis, likely having been landowners. These individual Sipahis were closely related by descent and blood, and taking account kinship ties, even though they had heterogeneous, Christian, Slavic and Oriental names, they appear to have been Albanians. Some have names indicating their origin, such as ''Shimerd Vardarli'' from Skopje, making it likely these timariotes were locals.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Rexha |first=Iljaz |year=2011 |title=Vendbanimet dhe popullsia albane gjatë mesjetës në hapësirën e Maqedonisë së sotme: Sipas burimeve sllave dhe osmane |url=https://www.ceeol.com/search/article-detail?id=70066 |journal=Gjurmime Albanologjike: Seria e Shkencave Historike |issue=41–42 |pages=167–218 |postscript=Në vijim po japim edhe disa të dhëna për spahinjtë e  krishterë me prejardhje albane, që i kishin timaret e veta së bashku me individë të tjerë, në simbiozë me antroponimi sllave në rrethinën e  Shkupit,  ku shihet se edhe këta ishin vendas,  meqë në defterë,  posaçërisht theksohet se këta individë ishin spahinj të vjetër, çka kuptohet se edhe para viteve 1467-68, në regjistrimet e  mëhershme,  që nuk janë ruajtur,  i kanë pasur timaret e  tyre.

Skopje began to recover from decades of decline after 1850. At that time, the city experienced a slow but steady demographic growth, mainly due to the rural exodus of Slav Macedonians.

At the outbreak of the uprising, the rebel forces derailed a military train.<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.promacedonia.org/ilpr1968/ilpr1968_6.html#2 |title=Илинденско-Преображенското въстание 1903–1968 – 6 |last=Karloukovski |first=Vassil |publisher=Издателство на Националния съвет на Отечествения фронт |date=1968 |language=bg}}</ref> On 3 and 5 August respectively, they attacked an Ottoman unit guarding the bridge on the Vardar river and gave a battle in the "St. Jovan" monastery. In the next few days, the band was pursued by numerous [[Bashibozuk]]s and moved to Bulgaria.

Following the [[Young Turk Revolution]] in 1908, the Ottoman Empire experienced democracy and several political parties were created.<ref name="history"/> However, some of the policies implemented by the [[Young Turks]], such as a tax rise and the interdiction of ethnic-based political parties, discontented minorities. Albanians opposed the nationalist character of the movement and led local uprisings in 1910 and 1912. During the latter, they managed to seize most of Kosovo and took Skopje on 11 August. On 18 August, the insurgents signed the Üsküb agreement which provided for the creation of an autonomous Albanian province and they were amnestied the day later.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Hugh Poulton |title=Who are the Macedonians? |publisher=C.

Following an alliance contracted in 1912, [[Bulgaria]], [[Greece]] and [[Serbia]] declared war on the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Their goal was to definitively expel the Ottomans from Europe. The [[First Balkan War]] started on 8 October 1912 and lasted six weeks. Serbians reached Skopje on 26 October.

In 1915, during the [[First World War]], Serbian Macedonia was invaded by Bulgaria, which captured Skopje on 22 October 1915.

After [[World War II]], Skopje greatly benefited from [[SFR Yugoslavia|Socialist Yugoslav]] policies which encouraged industry and the development of Macedonian cultural institutions. Consequently, Skopje became home to a national library, a philharmonic orchestra, a university, and the Macedonian Academy of Sciences and Arts. However, its post-war development was altered by the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|1963 earthquake]] which occurred on 26 July.

==Administration==

===Status===
[[File:MKD muni nonn(Skopje).png|thumb|Greater Skopje among the [[municipalities of North Macedonia]]]]
Being the capital and largest city of North Macedonia, Skopje enjoys a particular status granted by law. The last revision of its status was made in 2004. Since then, the City of Skopje has been divided into 10 municipalities which all have a council and a mayor, like all of the country's municipalities. Municipalities only deal with matters specific of their territory, and the City of Skopje deals with matters that concern all of them, or that cannot be divided between two or more municipalities.<ref name="local">{{cite web |url=http://lgi.osi.hu/cimg/0/1/3/4/3/Skopje_s_final.doc |title=The City of Skopje, Case Study in the Project Financing Metropolitan Cities in Transitional Countries |author=Aleksandra Maksimovska Veljanovski |publisher=[[Open Society Institute]], Local Government and Public Service Reform Initiative, Budapest |year=2008 |access-date=13 October 2012}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>

The City of Skopje is part of the [[Skopje Statistical Region]], which has no political or administrative power.<ref name="local"/>

===City Council===
The City Council consists of 45 members who serve a four-year term. It primarily deals with budget, global orientations and relations between the city and the government. Several commissions exist to treat more specific topics, such as urbanism, finances, environment of local development.<ref name="council">{{cite web |url=http://www.skopje.gov.mk/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=601 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130730023325/http://www.skopje.gov.mk/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=601 |url-status=dead |archive-date=30 July 2013 |title=Совет на Град Скопје, Мандат 2013–2017 |year=2013 |publisher=City of Skopje |access-date=4 July 2013}}</ref> The President of the council is elected by the Council Members.

===Mayor===

The [[Mayor of Skopje]] is elected every four years.
The mayor represents the City of Skopje and can submit ideas to the council, manages the administrative bodies and their officials.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skopje.gov.mk/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=70 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220722/http://www.skopje.gov.mk/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&tabid=70 |url-status=dead |archive-date=27 September 2007 |title=Competencies of the mayor |year=2009 |publisher=City of Skopje |access-date=15 March 2011}}</ref>

===Municipalities===
Skopje was first divided into administrative units in 1945, but the first municipalities were created in 1976. They were five: [[Centar Municipality (Skopje)|Centar]], [[Čair municipality|Čair]], [[Karpoš municipality|Karpoš]], [[Gazi Baba municipality|Gazi Baba]] and [[Kisela Voda municipality|Kisela Voda]]. After the 1991 independence of the country, power was centralized and municipalities lost much of their competences. A 1996 law restored them and created two new municipalities: [[Ǵorče Petrov municipality|Ǵorče Petrov]] and [[Šuto Orizari municipality|Šuto Orizari]]. After the [[2001 insurgency in Macedonia|insurgency between Albanian rebels and Macedonian forces]] in 2001, a new law was enacted in 2004 to incorporate [[Saraj Municipality]] into the City of Skopje. Saraj is mostly populated by Albanians and, since then, Albanians represent more than 20% of the city population. Thus Albanian became the second official language of the city administration, something which was one of the claims of the Albanian rebels. The same year, [[Aerodrom Municipality (Skopje)|Aerodrom Municipality]] separated itself from Kisela Voda, and [[Butel Municipality]] from Čair.<ref name="local"/>

Municipalities are administered by a council of 23 members elected every four years. They also have a mayor and several departments (education, culture, finances...). The mayor primarily deals with these departments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opstinacentar.gov.mk/administracija.aspx |title=Administration |publisher=Centar Municipality |access-date=15 March 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307064559/http://www.opstinacentar.gov.mk/administracija.aspx |archive-date=7 March 2011}}</ref>

Skopje is a medium city at the European level. Being the capital and largest city of North Macedonia, Skopje concentrates a large share of the national economy. The [[Skopje Statistical Region]], which encompasses the City of Skopje and some neighbouring municipalities, produces 45.5% of the Macedonian GDP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/pdf/2011/3.1.11.03.pdf |title=Gross domestic product and gross fixed capital formation, by regions, 2009 |publisher=State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref> In 2009, the regional GDP per capita amounted to US$6,565, or 155% of the Macedonian GDP per capita.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/pdf/2011/3.1.11.03.pdf |title=Gross domestic product and gross fixed capital formation, by regions |publisher=State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia |year=2009 |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref> This figure is, however, smaller than the one of neighboring [[Sofia]] (US$10,106),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lmlegalservices.com/blog/archives/825 |title=Bulgaria – Regional Differences |year=2012 |publisher=LM Legal Services |access-date=14 October 2012}}</ref> [[Sarajevo]] (US$10,048)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/ECAEXT/Resources/258598-1279117170185/7247167-1279119399516/7247361-1279119430793/sarajevo.pdf |title=Resouyrce data |date=21 May 2010 |website=siteresources.worldbank.org}}</ref> or [[Belgrade]] (US$7,983),<ref>{{Cite book |title=Serbia on the Road to Eu Accession: Consequences for Agricultural Policy and the Agri-Food Chain |author=Siemen Van Berkum et Natalija Bogdanov |publisher=CABI |year=2012 |isbn=9781780641454 |page=40}}</ref> but higher than the one of [[Tirana]] (US$4,126).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.top-channel.tv/english/artikull.php?id=2632 |title=Albanian economy concentrated in Tirana |publisher=Top Channel |year=2011 |access-date=14 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016020348/http://www.top-channel.tv/english/artikull.php?id=2632 |archive-date=16 October 2013}}</ref>

Because there are no other large cities in the country, and because of political and economic centralization, a large number of Macedonians living outside of Skopje work in the capital city. The dynamism of the city also encourages [[rural exodus]], not only from North Macedonia, but also from [[Kosovo]], [[Albania]] and Southern [[Serbia]].<ref name="quality">{{cite web |url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/file/80214 |title=The Quality of Life and Regional Development in FYR Macedonia |year=2010 |publisher=Hrčak, Portal znanstvenih časopisa Republike Hrvatske |author=William Bartlett |author2=Hristina Cipusheva |author3=Marjan Nikolov |author4=Miroljub Shukarov |access-date=19 March 2012}}</ref>

===Firms and activities===

In 2009, Skopje had 26,056 firms but only 145 of them had a large size. The large majority of them are either small (12,017) or very small (13,625).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/PXWeb2007bazi/Dialog/Saveshow.asp |title=Firms by size and municipality |year=2009 |publisher=State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia |access-date=4 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> A large share of the firms deal with trade of goods (9,758), 3,839 are specialized in business and real estate, and 2,849 are manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/PXWeb2007bazi/Dialog/Saveshow.asp |title=Firms by activity sector |publisher=State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia |access-date=4 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Although few in number, large firms account for 51% of the local production outside finance.<ref name="region"/>

Other zones are between Aerodrom and Kisela Voda, along the railway to [[Greece]]. These zones comprise Alkaloid Skopje (pharmaceuticals), Rade Končar (electrical supplies), [[Imperial Tobacco]], and Ohis (fertilizers). Two [[special economic zone]]s also exist, around the airport and the Okta refinery. They have attracted several foreign companies, such as [[Johnson Controls]], [[Johnson Matthey]] and [[Van Hool]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fez.gov.mk/interactive-map.html |title=TIDZ Skopje 1 |publisher=Directorate for Technological Industrial Development Zones |access-date=14 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024003817/http://fez.gov.mk/interactive-map.html |archive-date=24 October 2012}}</ref>

As the country's financial capital, Skopje is the seat of the [[Macedonian Stock Exchange]], of the [[National Bank of North Macedonia|National Bank]], and of most of the country's banking, insurance, and telecommunication companies, such as [[Makedonski Telekom]], [[Komercijalna banka Skopje]] and [[Stopanska Banka]]. The services sector produces 60% of the city GDP.<ref name="region"/>
[[File:Zeleno pazarce - Flickr - ImogenX (9).jpg|thumb|The Zelen Pazar ("green market")]]
Besides many small traditional shops, Skopje has two large markets, the "Zelen Pazar" (green market) and the "Bit Pazar" (flea market). They are both considered local institutions.<ref name="thiesen57"/> However, since the 1970s, retailing has largely been modernized and Skopje now has many supermarkets and shopping centres. The largest, Skopje City Mall, opened in 2012. It comprises a [[Carrefour]] hypermarket, 130 shops and a cinema, and employs 2,000 people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://finchannel.com/Main_News/Banks/117152_Macedonian_shoppers_set_for_retail_revolution_with_EBRD_support/ |title=Macedonian shoppers set for retail revolution with EBRD support |publisher=The Financial |year=2012 |access-date=14 October 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006072101/http://finchannel.com/Main_News/Banks/117152_Macedonian_shoppers_set_for_retail_revolution_with_EBRD_support/ |archive-date=6 October 2012}}</ref>

Skopje, just like North Macedonia as a whole, is characterized by a large ethnic diversity. The city is in a region where Macedonians and Albanians meet, and it has had populations of Bulgarians, Romani, Turks, Jews, and Serbs through its history. Skopje was mainly a Muslim city until the 19th century when large numbers of Christians started to settle there. According to the 2021 census, Macedonians were the largest ethnic group in Skopje, with 309,107 inhabitants, or 58.71% of the population. Then came Albanians with 120,293 inhabitants (22.85%), Roma people with 18,498 (3.51%), Serbs (9,478 inhabitants), Turks (8,524), Bosniaks (7,365) and [[Aromanians]] (also known as "Vlachs", 2,778). 6,284 people did not belong to any of these groups.<ref name="stats2" />

Macedonians form an overwhelming majority of the population in the municipalities of [[Aerodrom Municipality (Skopje)|Aerodrom]], [[Centar Municipality (Skopje)|Centar]], [[Ǵorče Petrov municipality|Ǵorče Petrov]], [[Karpoš municipality|Karpoš]] and [[Kisela Voda municipality|Kisela Voda]], which are all south of the [[Vardar]].<ref name="Ragaru536">{{harvnb|Ragaru|2008|p=536.}}</ref> They also form a majority in [[Butel municipality|Butel]]<ref name="Ragaru536537"/> and [[Gazi Baba municipality|Gazi Baba]] which are north of the river. Albanians form a majority in [[Čair municipality|Čair]] which roughly corresponds to the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]], and in [[Saraj municipality|Saraj]].<ref name="Ragaru535537">{{cite journal |last=Ragaru |first=Nadege |title=The Political Uses and Social Lives of "National Heroes": Controversies over Skanderbeg's Statue in Skopje |url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00682663/document |journal=Südosteuropa |volume=56 |issue=4 |year=2008 |pages=535–537 |access-date=22 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190222210307/https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00682663/document |archive-date=22 February 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> They form a large minority in Butel<ref name="Ragaru536537">{{harvnb|Ragaru|2008|pp=536–537.}}</ref> and Gazi Baba.

Relations between the two largest groups, Macedonians and Albanians, are sometimes difficult, as in the rest of the country.

===Religion===
[[File:Presveta Bogordica od Skopje 4.JPG|thumb|The church of the Nativity of the Virgin Mary]]
Religious affiliation is diverse: Macedonians, Serbs, and Aromanians are mainly Orthodox, with the majority affiliated to the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church – Ohrid Archbishopric|Macedonian Orthodox Church]]; Turks are almost entirely Muslim; those of Albanian ethnicity are largely Muslim, although Skopje also has a sizeable [[Roman Catholic]] Albanian minority, into which [[Mother Teresa]] was born; the Roma (Gypsies) represent a mixture (in almost equal numbers) of Muslim and Orthodox religious heritage.<ref>{{Cite book |author=Hugh Poulton |title=Who are the Macedonians? |publisher=C.

According to the 2002 census, 68.5% of the population of Skopje belonged to the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], while 28.6% belonged to [[Islam]]. The city also had Catholic (0.5%) and [[Protestant]] (0.04%) minorities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/Publikacii/knigaX.pdf |title=Census |year=2002 |publisher=State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia |access-date=26 October 2012}}</ref> The Catholics are served by the Latin [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Skopje|bishopric of Skopje]], in which is also vested the [[Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Macedonia]].

Until [[World War II]], Skopje had a significant Jewish minority which mainly descended from Spanish [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardis]] who had escaped the [[Inquisition]]. The community comprised 2,424 members in 1939 (representing about 3% of the city population), but most of them were deported and killed by [[Nazis]]. After the war, most of the survivors settled in Israel.<ref name="Mark Avrum Ehrlich 2009 980"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.europeanjewishfund.org/index.php?/communities/macedonia/ |title=Jewish Community in Macedonia |publisher=European Jewish Fund |access-date=28 February 2011}}</ref> Today the city has around 200 Jewish inhabitants (about 0.04% of the population).

Because of its 520-year Ottoman past, and the fact that many of its inhabitants today are Muslims, Skopje has more mosques than churches. Religious communities often complain about the lack of infrastructure and new places of worship are often built.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=92612947288&id=14&setIzdanie=22689 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228024309/http://www.novamakedonija.com.mk/NewsDetal.asp?vest=92612947288&id=14&setIzdanie=22689 |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 December 2013 |title=Во Скопје има 27 џамии и 15 цркви |date=26 September 2012 |publisher=Nova Makedonija |author=Sanja Jancevska |access-date=26 October 2012}}</ref> Skopje is the seat of many Macedonian religious organizations, such as the [[Macedonian Orthodox Church]] and the Islamic Religious Union of Macedonia.

==Transport==

===Main connections===
[[File:E65 Skopje Northern Bypass 1.jpg|thumb|Skopje bypass]]
Skopje is near three other capital cities, [[Prishtina]] ({{cvt|87|km|abbr=off}} away), [[Tirana]] (291&nbsp;km) and [[Sofia]] (245&nbsp;km). [[Thessaloniki]] is {{cvt|233|km|abbr=off}} south and [[Belgrade]] is {{cvt|433|km|abbr=off}} north.<ref name="rimed">{{cite web |url=http://www.seedcenter.gr/rimed/texts/Published%20Reports-Final/WP3-Published%20report%2015.pdf |title=Comparative Swot Analysis of the Four Metropolitan Regions, Transportation, Interaction, Relations and Networks among Skopje, Sofia, Tirana, and Thessaloniki |publisher=University of Thessaly |access-date=24 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119233709/http://www.seedcenter.gr/rimed/texts/Published%20Reports-Final/WP3-Published%20report%2015.pdf |archive-date=19 January 2010 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Skopje is also at the crossroad of two [[Pan-European corridors]]: [[Pan-European Corridor X|Corridor X]], which runs between [[Austria]] and [[Greece]], and [[Pan-European Corridor VIII|Corridor VIII]], which runs from the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] in Albania to the [[Black Sea]] in Bulgaria. Corridor X links Skopje to Thessaloniki, Belgrade, and Western Europe, while Corridor VIII links it with Tirana and Sofia.

Corridor X locally corresponds to the [[M-1 motorway (North Macedonia)|M-1 motorway]] ([[European route E75|E75]]), which is the longest highway in North Macedonia. It also corresponds to the [[Tabanovce]]-[[Gevgelija]] railway. Corridor VIII, less developed, corresponds to the M-4 motorway and the [[Kičevo]]-Beljakovce railway. Skopje is not quite on the Corridor X and the M-1 does not pass on the city territory. Thus the junction between the M-1 and M-4 is some {{cvt|20|km|abbr=off}} east, close to the airport. Although Skopje is geographically close to other major cities, movement of people and goods is not optimized, especially with [[Albania]]. This is mainly due to poor infrastructure. As a result, 61.8% of Skopjans have never been to [[Tirana]], while only 6.7% have never been to [[Thessaloniki]] and 0% to [[Sofia]]. Furthermore, 26% of Thessalonians, 33% of Sofians and 37% of Tiranans have never been to Skopje.<ref name="rimed"/>

The first highways were built during the Yugoslav period, when Skopje was linked through the [[Brotherhood and Unity Highway]] to, what was then, the Yugoslav capital [[Belgrade]] to the North, and the Greek border to the South.

Skopje has a bus network managed by the city and operated by three companies. The oldest and largest is JSP Skopje, a public company founded in 1948. JSP lost its monopoly on public transport in 1990 and two new companies, Sloboda Prevoz and Mak Ekspres, obtained several lines.

A tram network has long been planned in Skopje and the idea was first proposed in the 1980s. The project became real in 2006 when the mayor Trifun Kostovski asked for feasibility studies. His successor Koce Trajanovski launched a call for tenders in 2010 and the first line is scheduled for 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/macedonian-capital-readies-for-long-awaited-trams |title=Macedonia Capital Readies for Long-Awaited Trams |author=Sinisa Jakov Marusic |publisher=BalkanInsight |year=2012 |access-date=24 October 2012}}</ref>

A new network for small buses started to operate in June 2014, not to replace but to decrease the number of big buses in the city centre.

===Airport===
The airport was built in 1928. The first commercial flights in Skopje were introduced in 1929 when the Yugoslav carrier [[Aeroput]] introduced a route linking the city with the capital, [[Belgrade]].<ref name="aeroput">[http://www.europeanairlines.no/drustvo-za-vazdusni-saobracaj-a-d-aeroput-1927-1948/ Drustvo za Vazdusni Saobracaj A D – Aeroput (1927–1948)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210523020505/https://www.europeanairlines.no/drustvo-za-vazdusni-saobracaj-a-d-aeroput-1927-1948/ |date=23 May 2021 }} at europeanairlines.no</ref> A year later the route was extended to [[Thessaloniki]] in Greece, and further extended to Greek capital [[Athens]] in 1933.<ref name="aeroput"/> In 1935 Aeroput linked Skopje with [[Bitola]] and [[Niš]], and also operated a longer international route linking [[Vienna]] and [[Thessaloniki]] through [[Zagreb]], Belgrade and Skopje.<ref name="aeroput"/> After the Second World War, Aeroput was replaced by [[JAT Airways|JAT Yugoslav Airlines]], which linked Skopje to a number of domestic and international destinations until the dissolution of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.

===Architecture===
[[File:Skupi (Colonia Flavia Scupinorum) - by Pudelek 1.JPG|thumb|Ruins of Roman [[Scupi]]]]
Although Skopje has been destroyed many times throughout its history, it still has many historical landmarks which reflect the successive occupations of the city. Skopje has one of the biggest Ottoman urban complexes in Europe, with many Ottoman monuments still serving their original purpose. It was also a ground for [[Modernist architecture|modernist]] experiments in the 20th century, following the 1963 earthquake. At the beginning of the 21st century, it is again the subject of massive building campaigns, thanks to the "[[Skopje 2014]]" project. Skopje is thus an environment where old, new, progressist, reactionary, eastern and western perspectives coexist.<ref name="colophon"/>

[[File:Skopje Aqueduct 9.jpg|thumb|left|Skopje Aqueduct]]
Skopje has some remains of Prehistorical architecture which can be seen on the [[Tumba Madžari]] Neolithic site.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tumbamadzari.org.mk/en/open-air-museum/open-air-museum.php |title=Neolithic Settlement Tumba Madzhari in Skopje |publisher=Tumba Madžari |access-date=22 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130717075413/http://www.tumbamadzari.org.mk/en/open-air-museum/open-air-museum.php |archive-date=17 July 2013}}</ref> On the other side of the city lie the remains of the ancient [[Scupi]], with ruins of a theatre, thermae and a basilica.<ref name="archeology"/> The [[Skopje Aqueduct]], between Scupi and the city centre, is rather mysterious because its date of construction is unknown.

[[File:Manastir sveti Pantelejmon vo selo Nerezi.jpg|thumb|Church of Saint Panteleimon]]
[[Skopje Fortress]] was rebuilt several times before it was destroyed by the 1963 earthquake. Since then, it has been restored to its medieval appearance. It is the only medieval monument in Skopje, but several churches around the city illustrate the [[Serbo-Byzantine architecture|Vardar architectural school]] which flourished around 1300. Among these churches are the ones around [[Matka Canyon]] (St Nicholas, St Andrew and Matka churches). The [[Church of Saint Panteleimon, Gorno Nerezi|church of Saint Panteleimon]] in [[Gorno Nerezi]] dates from the 12th century. Its expressive frescoes anticipate the [[Italian primitives]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=History of art: the Western tradition |author1=Horst Woldemar Janson |author2=Anthony F.

[[File:Isak Bey Turbe Aladja Mosque Skopje.JPG|thumb|left|Aladža Mosque and its türbe]]
Examples of [[Ottoman architecture]] are in the [[Old Bazaar, Skopje|Old Bazaar]]. Mosques in Skopje are usually simple in design, with a square base and a single [[dome]] and [[minaret]]. Their entrance is usually emphasized by a portico, as on [[Mustafa Pasha Mosque]], dating from the 15th century. Some mosques show some originality in their appearance: [[Sultan Murad Mosque|Sultan Murad]] and Yahya Pasha mosques have lost their dome and have a pyramidal roof, while Isa Bey mosque has a rectangular base, two domes and two side wings. The Aladža Mosque was originally covered with blue faience, but it disappeared in the 1689 Great Fire. However, some tiles are still visible on the adjoining [[türbe]]. Other Ottoman public monuments include the 16th-century clock tower, a [[bedesten]], three [[caravanserai]]s, two [[Hammam|hammams]] and the [[Stone Bridge (Skopje)|Stone Bridge]], first mentioned in 1469.<ref name="ottoman"/><ref name="oldskopje">{{cite web |url=http://www.oldskopje.net/Monuments |title=Monuments |publisher=OldSkopje |access-date=8 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410230911/http://www.oldskopje.net/Monuments/ |archive-date=10 April 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The oldest churches in the city centre, the [[Church of the Ascension of Jesus, Skopje|Ascension]] and St Dimitri churches, were built in the 18th century, after the 1689 Great Fire. They were both renovated in the 19th century. The Church of the Ascension is particularly small it is half-buried in order not to overlook neighbouring mosques.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.oldskopje.net/mk/news/29.html |title=Црква Св.

[[File:Pošta vo Skopje, Macedonia.jpg|thumb|Main post office and the Communication Centre]]
After 1912, when Skopje was annexed by Serbia, the city was drastically westernized. Wealthy Serbs built mansions and town houses such as the 1926 [[Ristiḱ Palace]]. The architecture of that time is very similar to the one of Central Europe, but some buildings are more creative, such as the [[Moorish Revival architecture|Neo-Moorish]] Arab House and the [[Byzantine Revival architecture|Neo-Byzantine]] train station, both built in 1938.<ref name="colophon"/> [[Modernist architecture|Modernism]] appeared as early as 1933 with the former Ethnographic Museum (today the City Gallery), designed by [[Milan Zloković]].<ref name="colophon"/> However, modernist architecture only fully developed in Skopje after the 1963 earthquake. The reconstruction of the city centre was partially planned by Japanese [[Kenzo Tange]] who designed the new train station.<ref name="colophon"/> Macedonian architects also took part in the reconstruction: [[Georgi Konstantinovski]] designed the City Archives building in 1968 and the Hall of residence Goce Delčev in 1975, while [[Janko Konstantinov]] designed the Telecommunication Centre and the main post office (1974–1989). [[Slavko Brezovski]] designed the [[Church of St. Clement of Ohrid]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=388 |title=Macedonian Cities – Skopje Churches |website=macedonia.co.uk}}</ref> These two buildings are noted for their originality although they are directly inspired by [[brutalist architecture|brutalism]].<ref name="colophon"/>

The reconstruction turned Skopje into a proper modernist city, with large blocks of flats, austere concrete buildings and scattered green spaces. The city centre was considered as a grey and unattractive place when local authorities unveiled the "[[Skopje 2014]]" project in 2010.<ref>[http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/20045/45/ PM Gruevski: Yes, Skopje 2014 was my Idea] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111042343/http://macedoniaonline.eu/content/view/20045/45 |date=11 January 2012}}, Macedonian International News Agency, Saturday, 7 January 2012</ref><ref>[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/gallery/skopje-2014 Skopje 2014: The new face of Macedonia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121213192754/http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/gallery/skopje-2014 |date=13 December 2012}}, BalkanInsight</ref> It made plans to erect a large number of statues, fountains, bridges, and museums at a cost of about €500&nbsp;million.<ref>[http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/weddings-planned-inside-macedonian-triumphal-arch Macedonian Arch May Be Wedding Scene] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120725060156/http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/weddings-planned-inside-macedonian-triumphal-arch |date=25 July 2012}}, BalkanInsight</ref>

MOT – international theatre festival |website=mot.com.mk}}</ref> More than 700 theatrical performances have been presented at this festival so far, most of them being alternative, [[experimental theatre]] groups engaging young writers and actors. The MOT International Theatre Festival is also a member of the [[International Network for Contemporary Performing Arts (IETM)|International Network for Contemporary Performing Arts or IETM]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ietm.org/ |title=IETM |website=ietm.org |access-date=18 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206075809/http://ietm.org/ |archive-date=6 December 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Within the framework of the MOT Festival, the Macedonian National Center of the International Theater Institute (ITI) was established, and at the 25th ITI World Congress in Munich in 1993, it became a regular member of this theatre association.
