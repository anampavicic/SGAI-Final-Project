==History==
{{For timeline}}
{{See also|Fortress of Luxembourg}}
[[File:LASB K Hellwig 1053.jpg|thumb|left|City Anno 1600]]
[[File:Luxembourg City Night Wikimedia Commons.jpg|thumb|left|The Old City of Luxembourg at night]]
In the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] era, a fortified tower guarded the crossing of two [[Roman road]]s that met at the site of Luxembourg city. Through an exchange treaty with the abbey of [[Maximin of Trier|Saint Maximin]] in [[Trier]] in 963, [[Siegfried I of Luxembourg|Siegfried I]] of the [[Ardennes]], a close relative of [[Louis the Stammerer|King Louis II]] of [[Kingdom of France|France]] and [[Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Otto the Great]], acquired the feudal lands of Luxembourg. Siegfried built his castle, named ''Lucilinburhuc'' ("small castle"), on the [[Bock (Luxembourg)|Bock]] ''Fiels'' ("rock"), mentioned for the first time in the aforementioned exchange treaty.

In 987, Archbishop [[Egbert, Archbishop of Trier|Egbert]] of [[Archbishopric of Trier|Trier]] consecrated five altars in the Church of the Redemption (today St. Michael's Church). At a Roman road intersection near the church, a marketplace appeared around which the city developed.

The city, because of its location and natural geography, has through history been a place of strategic military significance. The first fortifications were built as early as the 10th century. By the end of the 12th century, as the city expanded westward around the new St. Nicholas Church (today the [[Notre-Dame Cathedral, Luxembourg|Cathedral of Notre Dame]]), new walls were built that included an area of {{convert|5|ha|acre|abbr=off}}. In about 1340, under the reign of [[John of Luxembourg|John the Blind]], new fortifications were built that stood until 1867.

In 1443, the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundians]] under [[Philip the Good]] conquered Luxembourg. Luxembourg became part of the Burgundian, and later [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Habsburg monarchy|Austrian]] empires (See [[Spanish Netherlands]] and [[Spanish Road]]) and under those Habsburg administrations Luxembourg Castle was repeatedly strengthened so that by the 16th century, Luxembourg itself was one of the strongest fortifications in Europe. Subsequently, the Burgundians, the Spanish, the French, the Spanish again, the Austrians, the French again, and the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussians]] conquered Luxembourg.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

In the 17th century, the first [[casemate]]s were built; initially, Spain built {{convert|23|km|mi|abbr=on}} of tunnels, starting in 1644.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.lcto.lu/html_en/sites_attractions/attractions/the_fortress.html|title = The Fortress|access-date = 23 July 2006|publisher = Luxembourg City Tourism Office}}</ref> These were then enlarged under French rule by [[Vauban|Marshal Vauban]], and augmented again under Austrian rule in the 1730s and 1740s.

During the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], the city was occupied by [[French First Republic|France]] twice: once, briefly, in 1792–93, and, later, after a seven-month [[Siege of Luxembourg (1794–95)|siege]].<ref name="Kreins 2003, p. 64">Kreins (2003), p. 64</ref> Luxembourg held out for so long under the French siege that French politician and military engineer [[Lazare Carnot]] called Luxembourg "the best [[fortress]] in the world, except Gibraltar", giving rise to the city's nickname: the '[[Gibraltar of the North]]'.<ref name="Kreins 2003, p. 64"/>

Nonetheless, the Austrian garrison eventually surrendered, and as a consequence, Luxembourg was annexed by the French Republic, becoming part of the [[département]] of [[Forêts]], with Luxembourg City as its [[préfecture]]. Under the 1815 [[Treaty of Paris (1815)|Treaty of Paris]], which ended the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Luxembourg City was placed under [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] military control as a part of the [[German Confederation]], although sovereignty passed to the [[House of Orange-Nassau]], in [[personal union]] with the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]].

After the [[Luxembourg Crisis]], the 1867 [[Treaty of London (1867)|Treaty of London]] required Luxembourg to dismantle the fortifications in Luxembourg City. Their demolition took sixteen years, cost 1.5 million gold [[French franc|francs]], and required the destruction of over {{convert|24|km|0|abbr=on}} of underground defences and {{convert|4|ha|acre|abbr=off}} of [[casemate]]s, [[Artillery battery|batteries]], [[barracks]], etc.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/699.pdf|title=World Heritage List – Luxembourg|date=1 October 1993|publisher=UNESCO|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040530150054/https://whc.unesco.org/archive/advisory_body_evaluation/699.pdf|archive-date=30 May 2004|access-date=19 July 2006}}</ref> Furthermore, the Prussian [[garrison]] was to be withdrawn.<ref>{{in lang|fr}} [http://www.lib.byu.edu/~rdh/wwi/1914m/1867.html Treaty of London, 1867], Article IV.

When, in 1890, [[William III of the Netherlands|Grand Duke William III]] died without any male heirs, the Grand Duchy passed out of Dutch hands, and into an independent line under [[Adolphe, Grand Duke of Luxembourg|Grand Duke Adolphe]]. Thus, Luxembourg, which had hitherto been independent in theory only, became a truly independent country, and Luxembourg City regained some of the importance that it had lost in 1867 by becoming the capital of a fully independent state.

Despite Luxembourg's best efforts to remain [[neutral country|neutral]] in the First World War, it was [[German occupation of Luxembourg during World War I|occupied by Germany]] on 2 August 1914. On 30 August, [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger|Helmuth von Moltke]] moved his headquarters to Luxembourg City, closer to his armies in France in preparation for a swift victory. However, the victory never came, and Luxembourg would play host to the German high command for another four years. At the end of the occupation, Luxembourg City was the scene of an attempted [[communist]] revolution; on 9 November 1918, communists declared a [[socialist republic]], but it lasted only a few hours.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Luxembourg's history : Mutiny in the Grand Duchy |url=https://today.rtl.lu/luxembourg-insider/history/a/1690130.html |access-date=2024-06-16 |website=today.rtl.lu |language=en}}</ref>

In 1921, the [[city limits]] were greatly expanded. The communes of [[Eich, Luxembourg|Eich]], [[Hamm, Luxembourg|Hamm]], [[Hollerich]], and [[Rollingergrund]] were incorporated into Luxembourg City, making the city the largest commune in the country (a position that it would hold until 1978).

In 1940, [[German occupation of Luxembourg during World War II|Germany occupied Luxembourg again]]. The [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] were not prepared to allow Luxembourgers self-government, and gradually integrated Luxembourg into the Third Reich by informally attaching the country administratively to a neighbouring German province. Under the occupation, the capital city's streets all received new, German names, which was announced on 4 October 1940.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|url = http://onsstad.vdl.lu/uploads/media/ons_stad_71-2002_30-32.pdf|title = Die Straßenbezeichnungen der Stadt Luxemburg unter deutscher Besatzung (1940–1944)|last = May|first = Guy|date = 2002|journal = Ons Stad|issue = 71|language = de|pages = 30–32|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304211708/http://onsstad.vdl.lu/uploads/media/ons_stad_71-2002_30-32.pdf|archive-date = 4 March 2016|url-status = dead}}</ref> The Avenue de la Liberté for example, a major road leading to the railway station, was renamed "Adolf-Hitlerstraße".<ref name=":0" /> Luxembourg City was liberated on 10 September 1944.<ref>Thewes (2003), p. 121</ref> The city was under long-range bombardment by the German [[V-3 cannon]] in December 1944 and January 1945.

After the war, Luxembourg ended its neutrality, and became a founding member of several inter-governmental and supra-governmental institutions. In 1952, the city became the headquarters of the High Authority of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]]. In 1967, the High Authority was merged with the commissions of the other European institutions; although Luxembourg City was no longer the seat of the ECSC, it hosted some part-sessions of the [[European Parliament]] until 1981.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.ena.lu/europe/european-union/parliament-alcide-gasperi-building-luxembourg.htm|title = Alcide De Gasperi Building|access-date = 23 July 2006|date = 16 June 2006|publisher = Centre Virtuel de la Connaissance sur l'Europe}}</ref> Luxembourg remains the seat of the European Parliament's secretariat, as well as the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]], the [[European Court of Auditors]], and the [[European Investment Bank]].

==Geography==
[[File:Luxembourg BW 2016-09-15 12-44-12.jpg|thumb|right|200px|View from the [[Grund, Luxembourg|Grund]] up to the Old Town]]

===Topography===

Luxembourg City lies on the southern part of the [[Luxembourg plateau]], a large [[Early Jurassic]] [[sandstone]] formation that forms the heart of the [[Gutland (Luxembourg)|Gutland]], a low-lying and flat area that covers the southern two-thirds of the country.

The city centre occupies a picturesque site on a salient, perched high on precipitous cliffs that drop into the narrow valleys of the [[Alzette]] and [[Pétrusse]] rivers, whose confluence is in Luxembourg City. The {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep gorges cut by the rivers are spanned by many bridges and [[viaduct]]s, including the [[Adolphe Bridge]], the [[Grand Duchess Charlotte Bridge]], and the [[Passerelle (Luxembourg)|Passerelle]]. Although Luxembourg City is not particularly large, its layout is complex, as the city is set on several levels, straddling hills and dropping into the two gorges.

The commune of Luxembourg City covers an area of over {{convert|51|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or 2% of the Grand Duchy's total area. This makes the city the [[List of communes of Luxembourg by area|fourth-largest commune]] in Luxembourg, and by far the largest [[urban area]]. Luxembourg City is not particularly densely populated, at about 1,700 people per km<sup>2</sup>; large areas of Luxembourg City are maintained as parks, forested areas, or sites of important heritage (particularly the [[UNESCO]] sites), while there are also large tracts of farmland within the city limits.

===Quarters of Luxembourg City===
{{Main|Quarters of Luxembourg City}}
Luxembourg City is subdivided into twenty-four [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarters]] ({{langx|fr|quartiers|link=no}}), which cover the commune in its entirety. The quarters generally correspond to the major neighbourhoods and suburbs of Luxembourg City, although a few of the historic districts, such as [[Bonnevoie]], are divided between two quarters.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}

===Climate===
Luxembourg City has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Cfb]]), with moderate precipitation, cold to cool winters and warm summers. It is cloudy about two-thirds of the year.{{Citation needed|date=December 2020}}
