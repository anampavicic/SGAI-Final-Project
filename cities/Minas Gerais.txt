'''Minas Gerais''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|ˈminɐz ʒeˈɾajs|lang|Pt-br_Minas_Gerais.ogg}}) is one of the 27 [[federative units of Brazil]], being the fourth largest state by area and the second largest in number of inhabitants with a population of 20,539,989 according to the [[2022 Brazilian census|2022 census]]. Located in the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast Region]] of the country, it is bordered to south and southwest by [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]; [[Mato Grosso do Sul]] to the west; [[Goiás]] and the [[Federal District (Brazil)|Federal District]] to the northwest; [[Bahia]] to the north and northeast; [[Espírito Santo]] to the east; and [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] to the southeast. The state's capital and largest city, [[Belo Horizonte]], is a major urban and finance center in Brazil, being the [[List of largest cities in Brazil#Top 115 most populous cities and state capitals|sixth most populous municipality]] in the country while its [[Greater Belo Horizonte|metropolitan area]] ranks as the [[List of metropolitan areas in Brazil|third largest in Brazil]] with just over 5.8 million inhabitants, after those of [[São Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]. Minas Gerais' territory is subdivided into [[List of municipalities in Minas Gerais|853 municipalities]], the largest number among Brazilian states.

The state's terrain is quite rugged and some of [[List of mountains in Brazil|Brazil's highest peaks]] are located in its territory. It is also home to the source of some of Brazil's main rivers, such as the [[São Francisco River|São Francisco]] and [[Rio Grande (Paraná River tributary)|Grande]] rivers, which places it in a strategic position with regard to the country's water resources. It has a [[tropical climate]], which varies from [[Humid subtropical climate|colder and humid]] in the south to [[Semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] in its northern portion. All of these combined factors provide it with a rich fauna and flora distributed in the biomes that cover the state, especially the [[Cerrado]] and the threatened [[Atlantic Forest]].

Minas Gerais' territory was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous peoples]] when the [[Discovery of Brazil|Portuguese arrived in Brazil]]. It experienced a large migration wave following the discovery of gold in the late 17th century. The [[Brazilian Gold Rush|mining of gold]] brought wealth and development to the then [[Captaincies of Brazil|captaincy]], providing its economic and cultural development; however, gold soon became scarce, causing the emigration of a large part of the population until [[Brazilian coffee cycle|a new cycle]] (that of coffee) once again brought Minas Gerais national prominence and whose end led to the relatively late industrialization process. Minas Gerais currently has the third largest GDP among Brazilian states, with a large part of it still being the product of mining activities. The state also has a notable infrastructure, with a large number of hydroelectric plants and the largest road network in the country.

Due to its natural beauty and historical heritage, Minas Gerais is an important tourist destination. It is known for its heritage of [[Colonial architecture of Brazil|colonial architecture]] and art in historical cities such as [[Ouro Preto]] and [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]], [[São João del-Rei]], [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]], [[Tiradentes, Minas Gerais|Tiradentes]], [[Congonhas]], [[Sabará]] and [[Serro]]. In the south, its tourist points are hydro-mineral spas, such as the municipalities of [[Caxambu]], [[Lambari, Minas Gerais|Lambari]], [[São Lourenço, Minas Gerais|São Lourenço]], [[Poços de Caldas]], [[São Thomé das Letras]], Monte Verde (a district of [[Camanducaia]]) and the national parks of [[Caparaó National Park|Caparaó]] and [[Serra da Canastra National Park|Canastra]]. In the [[Serra do Cipó National Park|Serra do Cipó]], [[Sete Lagoas]], [[Cordisburgo]] and [[Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais|Lagoa Santa]], the caves and waterfalls are the main attractions. The people of Minas Gerais also have a peculiar culture, marked by traditional religious manifestations and typical countryside cuisine, in addition to national importance in contemporary artistic productions and also in the sports scene.

==Etymology==

Two interpretations are given for the origin of the name Minas Gerais.<ref>[http://portal.matiascardoso.mg.gov.br:8080/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PUB.1016.6 João Batista de Almeida Costa. Os Berços de Minas Gerais] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706155757/http://portal.matiascardoso.mg.gov.br:8080/c/portal/layout?p_l_id=PUB.1016.6 |date=6 July 2011}}</ref>

The first interpretation is that the name simply means "General Mines", referring to a number of mines which were located in several spots spread around a larger region.

The second interpretation derives the name from
the former name of the colonial province, "Minas dos Matos Gerais" ("Mines of the General Woods"), referring to two distinct regions encompassed by the state: the region of the mines (Minas), and the "general" region ("Matos Gerais" or "Campos Gerais", roughly meaning "General Fields"). The latter corresponded to the areas of ''[[sertão]]'' which were farther and hard to access (with an economy based on farming and agriculture) from the mining spots, whose economic space was urban in origin.<ref>João Antônio de Paula: Raízes da Modernidade em Minas Gerais. Belo Horizonte: Editora Autêntica, 2000</ref>

==History==
Part of the history of the current state of Minas Gerais was determined by the exploration of the great mineral wealth found in its territory. Its name, in fact, comes from the large quantity and variety of mines present, which began to be explored since the 17th century and to this day drive an important fraction of the state's economy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.famamg.com/2010/10/origem-do-nome-minas-gerais.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140109104921/http://www.famamg.com/2010/10/origem-do-nome-minas-gerais.html|archive-date=9 January 2014|title=Origem do nome Minas Gerais|author=Jornal Fama|date=6 October 2010|access-date=4 January 2014}}</ref>

In the mid-19th century, Danish paleontologist [[Peter Wilhelm Lund]] discovered, in the [[Lagoa Santa, Minas Gerais|Lagoa Santa]] region, human remains belonging to a population that lived there thousands of years ago, nicknamed the "Lagoa Santa People".<ref name="FazCiência_Pré2">{{Cite web|url=http://revista.fapemig.br/materia.php?id=175|title=A fascinante pré-história de Minas Gerais|author=Minas faz Ciência|year=2002|access-date=20 December 2013|archive-date=23 January 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123091910/http://revista.fapemig.br/materia.php?id=175|url-status=dead}}</ref> The region of Minas Gerais was inhabited by [[Indigenous peoples in Brazil|indigenous peoples]] as long as 11,400 to 12,000 years ago, based on the estimated age of the [[Luzia Woman|Luzia woman]], the name of the oldest human fossil found in the Americas. Luzia was found in 1974 in excavations in Lapa Vermelha, a cave between the municipalities of Lagoa Santa and [[Pedro Leopoldo]], in the [[Greater Belo Horizonte|Metropolitan Region of Belo Horizonte]].<ref>Feathers, James; R.

Based on the analysis of Luzia and her people's cranial morphology, it was theorized that they had [[Australo-Melanesian|Australoid]] features, having belonged to a population that arrived in the Americas before the ancestors of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindians]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Maciel|first=Camila|url=https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/geral/noticia/2018-11/novo-rosto-de-luzia-pesquisa-desmonta-teoria-sobre-migracao-ancestral|title=Novo rosto de Luzia: estudo desmonta teoria de migração para América|date=8 November 2018|access-date=25 July 2023|website=Agência Brasil}}</ref> However, with the analysis of the genetic material of the human remains of the Lagoa Santa People, it was found that this prehistoric population had completely Amerindian DNA, therefore ruling out any relationship with Australasian populations and the theory that the [[peopling of the Americas]] was due to a wave of individuals with Australoid traits and another of [[Mongoloid]] individuals.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/portuguese/geral-46098327|title=DNA de fósseis do Brasil desafia teorias de 'descoberta' da América|date=8 November 2018|access-date=25 July 2023|website=BBC News Brasil|last=Silveira|first=Evanildo da}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Menezes|first=César|url=https://g1.globo.com/ciencia-e-saude/noticia/2018/11/08/estudo-contradiz-teoria-de-povoamento-da-america-e-sugere-que-rosto-de-luzia-era-diferente-do-que-se-pensava.ghtml|title=Estudo contradiz teoria de povoamento da América e sugere que rosto de Luzia era diferente do que se pensava|date=8 November 2018|access-date=25 July 2023|website=G1}}</ref> The indigenous peoples of Minas Gerais, as well as throughout Brazil and South America, are descendants of the groups who migrated there through North America.<ref>{{Cite web |date=9 February 2010 |title=De onde vieram os índios? |url=http://www.jequitinhonha.org.br/DetailsPage.aspx?process=ProcessMessage&id=116&entityId=26 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109114526/http://www.jequitinhonha.org.br/DetailsPage.aspx?process=ProcessMessage&id=116&entityId=26 |archive-date=9 January 2014 |access-date=9 May 2019 |publisher=Centro de Convivência Infanto Juvenil Curumim}}</ref>

In the region of the municipalities of [[Januária]], [[Montalvânia]], [[Itacarambi]] and [[Juvenília]], in northern Minas Gerais, archaeological excavations have led to estimates that the initial settlement occurred at Luzia's time. Starting in this period, cultural characteristics emerged, such as the use of stone or bone, the creation of cemeteries and small grain silos, as well as cave paintings. Later, about four thousand years ago, it is speculated that vegetable cultivation occurred, in particular corn, and that two thousand years ago, ceramic products were already being manufactured.<ref name="FazCiência_Pré">{{Cite web|url=http://revista.fapemig.br/materia.php?id=175|title=A fascinante pré-história de Minas Gerais|date=August 2002|access-date=2019-05-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110123091910/http://revista.fapemig.br/materia.php?id=175|archive-date=2011-01-23|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Northern Minas Gerais was dominated by the [[Kiriri people|Kiriris]] and [[Xakriabá]]s. Center, western and southern Minas Gerais were inhabited by the Cataguás, who were the most numerous indigenous group in Minas Gerais' territory in colonial times, so much so that the region was known as "Campos Gerais dos Cataguases" in the time of the [[bandeirantes]]. The regions of [[Triângulo Mineiro]] and [[Alto Paranaíba]] were inhabited by the [[Kayapo]]s and Araxás, while the [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|Zona da Mata]] was populated by the [[Purí people|Puri]].

The first European expedition into Minas Gerais' territory was led by Spaniards Francisco Bruza Espinosa and Juan de Azpilcueta Navarro between 1553 and 1555, which left the coast of [[Bahia]] and traveled through northern Minas Gerais. In the following decades, other expeditions known as "entries", coming from the Brazil's [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeastern]] coast, traveled through this same region, such as that of Sebastião Fernandes Tourinho in 1573.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://etnolinguistica.wdfiles.com/local--files/biblio%3Ajose-1965-indigenas/JoseOiliam_1965_IndigenasMG.pdf|title=Indígenas de Minas Gerais: Aspectos sociais, políticos, etnológicos|last=José|first=Oiliam|publisher=Edições Movimento - Perspectiva|year=1965|place=Belo Horizonte|pages=47–49}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://descubraminas.com.br/MinasGerais/Pagina.aspx?cod_pgi=5|title=Minas Gerais - história|access-date=8 June 2023|website=Descubra Minas|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306061627/http://descubraminas.com.br/MinasGerais/Pagina.aspx?cod_pgi=5|archive-date=6 March 2016}}</ref> From the end of the 16th century, ''bandeirantes'' traveled the territory of Minas Gerais in search of gold and precious stones.

Between 1692 and 1693, the ''bandeirante'' Antônio Rodrigues Arzão discovered the first gold deposits in the territory of Minas Gerais. In the following years, ''bandeirantes'' from the towns of São Paulo and [[Taubaté]] traveled through the [[Das Velhas River|Das Velhas]] region looking for gold. In 1696, Salvador Fernandes Furtado discovered gold on the banks of the [[Do Carmo River (Minas Gerais)|Carmo river]] and built his camp there, which gave rise to the town of Nossa Senhora do Carmo (now [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]]). Two years later, Antônio Dias de Oliveira discovered gold at the foot of the Itacolomi Peak and founded his settlement there, the embryo of Vila Rica (currently [[Ouro Preto]]). In 1702, João de Siqueira Afonso discovered precious stones in the [[Rio das Mortes (Minas Gerais)|Rio das Mortes]] valley.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":2" /> Initially, gold was extracted from riverbeds, which forced miners to move as the deposits ran out. After some time, exploration also began to be carried out on mountain slopes, which forced the permanent settlement of miners, leading to the emergence of the first settlements.<ref name="ciclo do ouro">{{Cite web|url=http://www.idasbrasil.com.br/idasbrasil/geral/port/ouro.asp|title=A corrida do ouro|author=Idas Brasil|access-date=19 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.abmbrasil.com.br/quem-somos/historico/os-bandeirantes-descobrem-ouro/|title=E os bandeirantes descobrem o ouro|author=Associação Brasileira de Metais|access-date=9 January 2014|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140109105008/http://www.abmbrasil.com.br/quem-somos/historico/os-bandeirantes-descobrem-ouro/|archive-date=9 January 2014}}</ref>

The news of the discovery of gold soon spread, initiating a [[Brazilian Gold Rush|gold rush]], and in the following decades hundreds of thousands of people eager for wealth, mainly Portuguese (which included [[New Christian]]s), but also colonial Brazilians from São Paulo, Bahia, Pernambuco and Rio de Janeiro, settled in Minas Gerais. The arrival of large numbers of people in a short time led to epidemics and food shortages.<ref name=":2" /> In 1697, the Portuguese used enslaved African labor to start building the [[Estrada Real]], the "royal road," that would connect the ports of cities of [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[Paraty]] to the mineral-rich regions of Vila Rica, Serro, and, at the northernmost point, Diamantina.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

São Paulo settlers considered themselves owners of the gold taken from the mines, claiming the right due to having discovered and conquered it, and did not want others to take possession of the mines. As a result, in 1707, they came into conflict with the Portuguese and other Brazilian settlers (nicknamed "''emboabas''", a Tupi term that means "one who offends"), causing the [[War of the Emboabas]], which ended in 1709. The São Paulo settlers were defeated and many of them had to abandon the gold deposits in Minas Gerais, having to look for the metal in what is now the [[Central-West Region, Brazil|Central-West region]] of Brazil, finding it years later in Goiás and [[Mato Grosso]].<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/23155128|title=Um Governo de Engonços: Metrópole e Sertanistas na Expansão dos Domínios Portugueses aos Sertões do Cuiabá (1721-1728)|access-date=28 April 2016|website=Academia|date=January 2015 }}</ref>

Prior to 1720, Minas Gerais was part of the [[captaincy of São Vicente]]. The imposition of the authority of the Portuguese Crown contributed to the end of the conflict, with the creation of the Captaincy of São Paulo and Minas do Ouro in 1709.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.uol.com.br/historiaviva/noticias/emboabas_na_terra_dos_bandeirantes.html|title=Emboabas na terra dos banddeirantes|author=Bruno Fiuza|publisher=Revista História Viva|access-date=19 December 2013}}</ref> In 1711, the first villages were created in Minas Gerais, namely [[Sabará]], Vila Rica and Vila de Nossa Senhora do Carmo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://descubraminas.com.br/MinasGerais/Pagina.aspx?cod_pgi=2775|title=1711 - 2011 - Mariana, Ouro Preto e Sabará - 300 anos de história|access-date=8 June 2023|website=Descubra Minas|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306114441/http://descubraminas.com.br/MinasGerais/Pagina.aspx?cod_pgi=2775|archive-date=6 March 2016}}</ref> In 1720, the [[Vila Rica Revolt]] took place against taxes on gold and, as a result, that same year the Captaincy of Minas Gerais was created after the dismemberment of São Paulo e Minas do Ouro.<ref name=":2" /> The first capital of Minas Gerais, and seat of the local see, was the city of Mariana; it was later moved to Vila Rica. In the late 18th century, Vila Rica was the largest city in Brazil and one of the most populous in the Americas.

The Portuguese Crown then began to strictly control the mining of gold, instating a 20% tax of everything that was produced, which became known as "the fifth". The captaincy's population continued to grow, but until then there were only small subsistence agricultural crops, which required the import of products from other regions of the colony. New access ways to the region began to be created and the flow of people and goods increased intensely, thus creating the first large consumer market in Brazil. Villages appeared along these access points, therefore playing a key role in the population of the captaincy. Among these routes, the ''Caminho Novo'' stands out, which connected the mining regions to Rio de Janeiro. The intense mix of people associated with wealth from gold and urban life led to the formation of a new, culturally diverse society, with several musicians, artists, sculptors and artisans. Among the cultural movements, the work of [[Aleijadinho]] and [[Manoel da Costa Ataíde|Master Ataíde]] stands out, among others, which allowed the flourishing of a [[Baroque in Brazil|local Baroque]].<ref name="ciclo do ouro" /> Aleijadinho's sculptural and architectural work, as exhibited in the [[Twelve Prophets of Aleijadinho|Twelve Prophets]] and [[Church of Saint Francis of Assisi (Ouro Preto)|The Church of Saint Francis of Assisi]] in Ouro Preto, are prime examples of this period.

In addition to art and architecture, there was an explosion of musical activity in Minas Gerais in the 18th century. Printed copies of European music, as well as accomplished musicians, made the journey to the area, and soon a local school of composition and performance was born and achieved considerable sophistication. Several composers worked in Minas Gerais in the 18th century, mainly in Vila Rica, Sabará, Mariana, and other cities. Some of the names which have survived include [[Emerico Lobo de Mesquita|José Joaquim Emerico Lobo de Mesquita]], [[Marcos Coelho Neto]], [[Francisco Gomes da Rocha]] and Ignácio Parreiras Neves; they cultivated a style related to the [[Classical period (music)|classical European style]], but marked by more a more chordal, [[homophony|homophonic]] sound, and they usually wrote for mixed groups of voices and instruments.{{Citation needed|date=August 2021}}

In the 1720s, in the Jequitinhonha valley region, the discovery of diamonds occurred, although its discoverers did not recognize the value of this precious stone for decades. However, the Portuguese Crown, upon recognizing the region's mineral production, soon established a way of charging taxes in a similar way to the gold tax. The main diamond exploration center was close to where Arraial do Tijuco (today [[Diamantina, Minas Gerais|Diamantina]]) emerged.<ref name="diamantes">{{Cite web|url=http://www.historianet.com.br/conteudo/default.aspx?codigo=302|title=Mineração no Brasil colonial|author=Histórianet|access-date=21 December 2013}}</ref>

At the height of gold mining, enslaved labor was essential for large landowners. In this way, the trade in slaves [[Atlantic slave trade to Brazil|brought from the African continent]] to work in the mines intensified. Many slaves tried and managed to escape, which led to the emergence of [[Quilombo|''quilombos'']] throughout Minas Gerais. It is estimated that during the 18th century more than 120 of these communities emerged throughout the captaincy. These settlements were not so far from mining centers, which made it easier for more slaves to escape. There was also a trade in subsistence products between slaves and traders, who took advantage of the lower price offered by the former.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cpisp.org.br/comunidades/html/brasil/mg/mg_historia.html|title=Comunidades Quilombolas do Estado de Minas Gerais|author=Comissão Pró-Índio de São Paulo|access-date=20 December 2013}}</ref> In 1753, [[Rosa Egipcíaca]], was enslaved and forced to work as a prostitute in a mine in the region, until she became ill and began to have religious visions. These visions led to her arrest and imprisonment and ultimately interrogation by the Inquisition. She recorded them in the first book to be written by a black woman in Brazil — ''Sagrada Teologia do Amor Divino das Almas Peregrinas''.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web |title=Enslaved: Peoples of the Historical Slave Trade |url=https://enslaved.org/fullStory?kid=16-23-102088 |access-date=2021-08-21 |website=enslaved.org |language=en}}</ref>

==== Minas Gerais' conspiracy ====
{{Main|Inconfidência Mineira{{!}}Minas Gerais conspiracy}}
[[File:Aleijadinho8.jpg|thumb|Baruch, 18th century [[Baroque]] sculpture, by Aleijadinho|left|271x271px]]During the 18th century, mining exploration was strongly controlled by the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese Crown]], which imposed heavy taxes on everything extracted (one fifth of all gold would go to the Crown). Several rebellions were attempted by the colonists, always facing strong reaction by the imperial crown. One of the most important was the [[Vila Rica Revolt|Vila Rica revolt]] that ended with the execution of Filipe dos Santos, the revolt's leader, but also with the separation of Minas Gerais from the captaincy São Paulo e Minas de Ouro. The most notable one, however, was the [[Inconfidência Mineira|Minas Gerais conspiracy]], started in 1789 by a group of middle-class colonists, mostly intellectuals and young officers. They were inspired by the [[American Revolution|American]] and French [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] ideals. The conspiracy failed and the rebels were arrested and exiled. The most famous of them, [[Tiradentes|Joaquim José da Silva Xavier]] (known as Tiradentes), was hanged by order of Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], becoming a local hero and a national martyr of Brazil. The Minas Gerais flag—a red triangle on a white background, along with the Latin motto "Libertas quæ sera tamen", "freedom albeit late"—is based on the design for the national flag proposed by the "Inconfidentes", as the rebels became known.

In the economic history of Brazil, Minas Gerais plays a pivotal role in shifting the economic axis from the Brazilian northeast (based on sugarcane, that starts declining in the 18th century) to the southeast of the country, which still remains the major economic center. The large amounts of gold found in the region attracted the attention of Portugal back to Brazil, progressively turning Rio de Janeiro into an important port city, from where these would be shipped to Portugal and where the Portuguese crown would eventually move its administration in 1808 after Napoleon Bonaparte's invasion of Portugal (see [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]]).

[[File:Rugendas - Habitans de Minas.jpg|thumb|People of Minas Gerais in the 1820s]]Due to the economic importance of the state and the particular traits of the local population—famed for its reserved and balanced character—Minas Gerais has also played an important role on national politics. During the 19th century, politicians such as [[José Bonifácio de Andrada e Silva]] were instrumental in the establishment of the Brazilian Empire under the rule of [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro I]] and later his son, [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]]. After the installation of the [[First Brazilian Republic]], during the early 20th century, Minas Gerais shared the control of the national political scene with [[São Paulo]] in what became known as the "[[Café com leite politics|coffee with milk politics]]" (coffee being the major product of São Paulo, and milk representing Minas Gerais' dairy industry, despite the latter also being an important coffee producer).

Minas Gerais was also home to two of the most influential Brazilian politicians of the second half of the 20th century. [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] was president from 1956 to 1961, and he was responsible for the construction of [[Brasília]] as the new capital of Brazil. [[Tancredo Neves]] had an extensive political career that culminated with his election in 1984 to be the first civil president after the 1964 military coup. However, he died after a series of health complications just as he was about to assume the position. Also, [[Itamar Franco]], former president of Brazil, lived there, though he was not born in Minas Gerais.

==Geography==
Minas Gerais features some of the longest rivers in Brazil, most notably the [[São Francisco River|São Francisco]], the [[Paraná River|Paraná]] and to a lesser extent, the [[Doce River|Doce river]]. The state also holds many hydroelectric power plants, including [[Furnas Dam|Furnas]]. Some of the highest peaks in Brazil are in the mountain ranges in the southern part of the state, such as the [[Mantiqueira Mountains]] and Serra do Cervo, that mark the border between Minas and its neighbors São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. The most notable one is the [[Pico da Bandeira|Bandeira peak]], the third highest mountain in Brazil at 2,890 m, standing on the border with Espírito Santo state. The state also has huge reserves of iron and sizeable reserves of gold and gemstones, including [[emerald]], [[topaz]] and [[Aquamarines|aquamarine]] mines. Emeralds found in this location are comparable to the best Colombia-origin emeralds, and are most often a bluish-green color.<ref>Arem, Joel [http://www.gemsociety.org/article/beryl-jewelry-gemstone-information/ Beryl Gemology Information]. Retrieved 30 December 2014.</ref>

Each region of the state has a distinct character, geographically and to a certain extent culturally.
[[File:Rugendas - Mattosinho pres Sao Joao Del Rey.jpg|thumb|Town of Bom Jesus de Matosinhos c. 1821–1825]]
* The central and eastern area of the state is hilly and rocky, with little vegetation on the mountains. Around Lagoa Santa and Sete Lagoas a typical [[Karst topography]] with caves and lakes is found. Some of the mountains are almost entirely iron ore, which led to extensive mining. About {{convert|200|km|mi}} to the east of Belo Horizonte is the second Metropolitan Region of the state, [[Vale do Aço metropolitan area|Vale do Aço]] (''Steel Valley''), which has iron and steel processing companies along the course of the Doce river and its tributaries. Vale do Aço's largest cities are [[Ipatinga]], [[Coronel Fabriciano]] and [[Timóteo (municipality)|Timóteo]]. The city of [[Governador Valadares]] is in the limit of this region with the North.
* The south of Minas Gerais is hilly and green, with coffee and milk production. This region is notably colder than the rest of the state, and some locations are subject to temperatures just below the freezing point during the winter. The region is also famed for its mineral-water resorts, including the cities of Poços de Caldas, Lambari, São Lourenço and Caxambu. Many industries are located at [[Varginha]] and [[Pouso Alegre]].
* The southeast of the state, called [[Zona da Mata (Minas Gerais)|Zona da Mata]], was the richest region until the mid 20th century, nowadays the biggest city, [[Juiz de Fora]], remains an important industrial, cultural and educational center, being also the fourth largest in Minas Gerais. The day-to-day living in the Zona da Mata however, is better represented by a group of smaller cities like [[Manhuaçu]], [[Além Paraíba]], [[Viçosa, Minas Gerais|Viçosa]], [[Leopoldina, Minas Gerais|Leopoldina]], [[Cataguases]], [[Muriaé]], [[Ubá]], [[Astolfo Dutra]] and several others. Those cities put together form a strong economic presence based mostly on agriculture, textiles and minerals. The city of the principal coffee region in Minas Gerais is [[São João do Manhuaçu]] situated in Zona da Mata.
* The west of Minas Gerais, also known as "''[[Triângulo Mineiro]]''" (which means "the Minas Triangle", due to the geographic shape of this region), is composed of a particular type of savanna, known as the ''[[cerrado]]''. This region was initially occupied by large free-wheeling beef ranches, which are still important for the economy of the region. Over the 1990s, extensive soy and corn farms occupied much of the farming land available. The cerrado is also one of the principal coffee-growing areas of Brazil. The main cities of this region are [[Uberlândia]], [[Uberaba]], [[Patos de Minas]] and [[Araguari]].
* The north of Minas Gerais is part of the arid ''sertão'' of the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|northeast region]], and is thus subject to frequent droughts. Recent irrigation projects use the water from the [[São Francisco River]] for agriculture; the river crosses the northern region carrying water from its basin in the central area of the state, which is subject to a regular rainfall pattern. The diamond mines of this region, mainly in Diamantina, attracted miners but are now exhausted, and the remaining population lives in poor conditions, especially in the valley of the [[Jequitinhonha River]]. The region is, however, known for its high quality [[cachaça]] production. [[Salinas, Minas Gerais|Salinas]] in particular exports large amounts of this alcoholic beverage. The main cities of this region are [[Montes Claros]], [[Teófilo Otoni]], [[Pirapora]] and [[Janaúba]].

===Paleontology===
[[File:MaxakalisaurusTopai Miniat.jpg|thumb|''Maxakalisaurus'']]
The discovery of the ''[[Maxakalisaurus topai]]'' (Dinoprata) fossils was a significant paleontological find. The fossil is a genus of [[titanosaur]]id dinosaur found 45 kilometers (28&nbsp;mi) from the city of [[Prata (Minas Gerais)|Prata]], in the state of Minas Gerais in 1998. It was closely related to ''[[Saltasaurus]]'', a [[sauropod]] considered unusual because it had evolved apparently defensive traits, including bony plates on its skin and vertical plates along its spine; such osteoderms have also been found for Maxakalisaurus. The genus name is derived from the tribe of the [[Maxakali]].
[[File:Replica de Titanossauro em Peirópolis.jpg|thumb|Full-scale titanosaur replica at the Dinosaur Museum in [[Peirópolis]], Uberaba.|294x294px]]
The ''Maxakalisaurus'' fossils belonged to an animal about 13&nbsp;meters (43.3&nbsp;ft) long, with an estimated weight of 9&nbsp;tons, although, according to paleontologist [[Alexander Kellner]], it could reach a length of approximately 20&nbsp;meters (65&nbsp;ft). It had a long neck and tail, ridged teeth (unusual among sauropods) and lived about 80&nbsp;million years ago. Because sauropods seem to have lacked significant competition in South America, they evolved there with greater diversity and more unusual traits than elsewhere in the world. A replica has been displayed at the [[National Museum of Brazil]], since August 28, 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://acd.ufrj.br/~museuhp/CP/Bol-Geol/Bol%20Geol%20Kellner%20-%20PDF.pdf |title=On a New Titanosaur Sauropod From the Bauru Group, Late Cretaceous of Brazil |access-date=2007-03-15 |url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315192548/http://acd.ufrj.br/~museuhp/CP/Bol-Geol/Bol%20Geol%20Kellner%20-%20PDF.pdf |archive-date=2007-03-15 }}</ref>

In the 1940s, fossil records from the [[Late Cretaceous]] period began to be unearthed in the territory of [[Uberaba]], many of them exceptionally well-preserved. Subsequently, extensive research efforts were initiated by the [[National Department of Mineral Production]] (DNPM), which appointed paleontologist [[Llewellyn Ivor Price]] to work in the region. Due to the large quantity of fossils uncovered, the Paleontological Research Center Llewellyn Ivor Price was established in 1991, alongside the Dinosaurs Museum in [[Peirópolis]], which is currently dedicated to the study of local paleontology in collaboration with research institutions worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web |title= |url=https://igeo.ufrj.br/inc/isc/1/1_32.pdf |access-date=2024-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240424063008/https://igeo.ufrj.br/inc/isc/1/1_32.pdf |archive-date=2024-04-24 }}</ref>

In March 2024, Uberaba was officially designated as a [[UNESCO]] [[UNESCO Global Geoparks|Global Geopark]], marking it as the first of its kind in Minas Gerais. The territory is situated within the [[Serra da Galga Formation]], where more than 10,000 fossils of various prehistoric creatures have been unearthed. Among these discoveries, the [[Uberabatitan|''Uberabatitan ribeiroi'']] found in 2004 ranks among the largest ever discovered in Latin America.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-01 |title=UNESCO names 18 new Geoparks {{!}} UNESCO |url=https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-names-18-new-geoparks |access-date=2024-04-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240401025255/https://www.unesco.org/en/articles/unesco-names-18-new-geoparks |archive-date=2024-04-01 }}</ref>

The ethnic composition of the population varies from town to town.

The population of Minas Gerais is the result of an intense mixture of peoples, particularly between Black Africans and Portuguese.<ref name=chica>{{cite book|title=Chica da Silva e o Contratador de Diamantes- o Outro Lado do Mito|author=Júnia Ferreira Furtado|pages=403|year=2009|publisher=Companhia das Letras}}</ref> In colonial Minas Gerais, the population was divided in five different categories: ''Whites'', mostly Portuguese; ''Africans'', who often did not have a surname and were usually known for their region of origin (for example ''Francisca Benguela'' would refer to [[Benguela Province|Benguela]]); ''Crioulos'' (Black people born in Brazil, usually to both African parents); Mulattoes (people of mixed Black and White ancestry, usually born to a Black mother and a Portuguese father) and ''Cabras'' (people of mixed ancestry, usually with high degree of Amerindian admixture). Black people and "Mulattoes" predominated in the population after the beginning of the colonization.<ref name=chica/> By the 19th century, however, whites were already the largest single group in the Minas Gerais population.<ref name="dominiopublico.gov.br">{{cite web|url=http://www.dominiopublico.gov.br/download/texto/cp057440.pdf |title=Domínio Público&nbsp;— Pesquisa Básica |publisher=Dominiopublico.gov.br |access-date=2013-06-08}}</ref> Taking the population as a whole (all groups included), European genes account for the majority of the Minas Gerais genetic heritage, which has been explained on the basis of the extremely high mortality rates of the enslaved African population and lower reproductive rate of African slaves (the vast majority of them were males, among other reasons for their lower reproductive success).<ref name="dominiopublico.gov.br"/> The Amerindian population was hit hard by the diseases brought by the European colonists and they did not have much of an impact either, especially in Minas Gerais, where European presence and colonization was massive.<ref name="dominiopublico.gov.br"/>

During the colonial period, the disproportion between the number of men and women was quite sharp. The census of 1738 in Serro do Frio, which included Diamantina, revealed that of the 9,681 inhabitants, 83.5% were men and 16.5% women. Among the slaves, women were only 3.1%.<ref name=chica/> The number of free "women of color" (Black and "Mulatto") was very high. The same census revealed that 63% of the former slaves were women and only 37% men. Since interracial relationships between "women of color" and White men were widespread, the female slaves were more likely to be freed than the male slaves.<ref name=chica/>

The monogamous family structure that the Catholic Church tried to deploy in colonial Brazil was the exception in Minas Gerais. At that time cohabitation and temporary relationships predominated in Minas Gerais, as well as in Brazil as a whole.<ref name=chica/> Monogamy and weddings in churches would only take root in Brazil in the 19th century, fitting the moral standards imposed by the Church. The role of women in colonial Minas Gerais was much more dynamic than it would be allowed by the standards of the time. Many women used to live on their own, were heads of family and worked, particularly the "women of color" and former slaves.<ref name=chica/> The society of Minas Gerais provided a great social mobility to former slaves, mainly for women. In [[Tejuco]], the percentage of White males who were head of family (37.7%) was very similar to the percentage of Black women who were head of family (38.5%). Many former slaves were able to accumulate goods and many of them became slave owners as well. Some Black people and mainly Mulattos were able to integrate themselves in the highest social stratum of the society of Minas Gerais, once restricted to Whites. This happened through a process of "whitening" their descendence and through the assimilation of the culture of the White elite, like being members of Catholic brotherhoods.<ref name=chica/>

===Service industry===
Tourism is also an important activity for the state: historical cities like Ouro Preto, Mariana, Sabará, Congonhas, Diamantina, Tiradentes, and São João del-Rei, are major attractions for visitors interested in their colonial architecture. Other cities, like [[Araxá]], Poços de Caldas, Lambari, Caxambu, Lavras, and others, attract visitors interested in their mineral watersprings. [[Eco-tourism]] is a rising economic activity in the state, especially in localities situated on the several highlands that exist in Minas Gerais.

== Tourism==
[[File:Historical Centre.jpg|thumb|The colonial city of [[Ouro Preto]], [[World Heritage Site]], is one of the most popular destinations in Minas Gerais.]]One of the most important tourist circuits in Minas Gerais is the Estrada Real, which passes through the old roads used to transport gold from the mines, connecting the central region of the state with the cities of Rio de Janeiro and Parati. The different itineraries of this circuit present historical, cultural and natural attractions for its visitors. Another noteworthy aspect of tourism in Minas Gerais includes visits to historic cities, which preserve colonial museum buildings, in addition to including museums and cultural spaces that reveal the past of these places. Of these cities, [[Ouro Preto]] stands out, where the Museum of Inconfidência is located.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://turismo.ouropreto.mg.gov.br/ |title=Turismo MG |access-date=2022-09-08 |archive-date=2022-09-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220908202319/https://turismo.ouropreto.mg.gov.br/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The relief of the state, with an abundance of peaks and mountains (especially the great peaks), in addition to the large number of grottos and caves, natural and artificial rivers and lakes, and the richness of the state's fauna and flora, attract practitioners of ecotourism and adventure tourism. Another relevant segment is [[rural tourism]], since Minas is one of the states with the most developments for this purpose. In the central region of the state, in addition to the historic cities and the capital, there are national parks such as Serra do Cipó, as well as the Inhotim Museum, which has one of the largest collections of contemporary art in the country. In the south of the state, there is the Circuito das Águas, known for its mineral spas.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://viagemeturismo.abril.com.br/cidades/serra-do-cipo/|title=Serra do Cipó|website=Viagem e Turismo|accessdate=Apr 16, 2023}}</ref> [[São Lourenço, Minas Gerais|São Lourenço]] and [[Poços de Caldas]] are cities famous for their spas, hot springs and thermal baths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://viagemeturismo.abril.com.br/cidades/sao-lourenco/|title=São Lourenço|website=Viagem e Turismo|accessdate=Apr 16, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://viagemeturismo.abril.com.br/cidades/pocos-de-caldas/|title=Poços de Caldas|website=Viagem e Turismo|accessdate=Apr 16, 2023}}</ref>

It also highlights business tourism, which is booming, since in recent years important events of international projection have been held in the state. In particular, the city of Belo Horizonte stands out in this segment, attracting more and more fairs, congresses and meetings, which can be attributed to the city's infrastructure and important hotel network. Other cities in the interior (such as Juiz de Fora, Uberaba and Uberlândia) also offer options for holding large business events.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/mg/minas-gerais/noticia/2022/05/13/flexibilizacao-das-medidas-contra-a-covid-da-folego-novo-para-o-turismo-de-negocios.ghtml|title=Flexibilização das medidas contra a Covid dá fôlego novo para o turismo de negócios|website=G1|date=13 May 2022 |accessdate=Apr 16, 2023}}</ref>

===Highways===
[[File:BR050.jpg|thumb|[[BR-050]], border of São Paulo with the Triângulo Mineiro.]]

As of November 2020, the state of Minas Gerais had, in addition to municipal highways, 39,738&nbsp;km of state and federal highways, of which 29,255 were paved and 2,505&nbsp;km were [[dual carriageway|duplicate highways]]. The state has duplicate highways that leave the capital [[Belo Horizonte]] and connect it with São Paulo ([[BR-381]]) and Rio de Janeiro ([[BR-040]]), and in its western part ([[BR-050]], [[BR-153]] and [[BR-365]] in the area known as the [[Triângulo Mineiro]], between the states of São Paulo and Goiás, near [[Uberaba]] and [[Uberlândia]]). Some parts of [[BR-262]] are also duplicated. The state, however, presents, in general, a duplication deficit, with sections of a single lane with movement above the saturation limit. Recently, in 2022, a project was created to grant [[BR-381]] to private initiative, with the intention of doubling 215&nbsp;km between [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Ipatinga]] and [[Novo Oriente de Minas]].<ref>[http://www.der.mg.gov.br/transportes/rodovias#malha-do-estado DER-MG resumo da malha]</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.itatiaia.com.br/editorias/politica/2022/08/03/antt-apresenta-novo-projeto-da-br-381-com-cinco-pracas-de-pedagio-veja-precos-e-locais|title=ANTT apresenta novo projeto da BR-381 com cinco praças de pedágio; veja preços e locais|first=Marcelo da|last=Fonseca|date=Aug 3, 2022|website=Rádio Itatiaia|accessdate=Apr 16, 2023}}</ref><ref>[https://www.kas.de/documents/265553/265602/KA+Cad+2019.2.pdf/eda7b688-9ae3-2f99-29f1-a8006f777abc?version=1.0&t=1567528762159 Proposta para uma rede brasileira de autoestradas]</ref><ref>[https://www.bain.com/contentassets/7e48e0824a0e4f2ba4542d36c130cef1/infraestrutura-rodoviaria-no-brasil-para-onde-vamos_pt.pdf Infraestrutura rodoviária no brasil: para onde vamos?]</ref>

Minas Gerais is the Brazilian state that harbors the highest mileage of highways. The state highway network is 269,545 kilometers, of which only 11,396 on federal roads and 21,472 on state highways and state coincide, corresponding to all other municipal roads. Because of its central position, the state is crossed by the most important national highways, like [[BR-116]] (Rio-Bahia), [[BR-040]] (Rio-Brasília) and others. Many of the most important Brazilian routes cross the state and, for this reason, it counts the greater proportion of car accidents per capita.

=== Railways ===

Rail transport has been around since the 19th century, when the Central Railway of Brazil was built in 1860. In 1874, the Leopoldina Railway was inaugurated. In 1880 the Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas was founded and in the following decades several other railways were opened in the territory of Minas Gerais. Starting in the 1960s, railways began to be replaced by roads, due to the growing demand for the car fleet, which resulted in the closure of some railways and branches. In the 1990s, the entire national railway system was privatized, disabling the remaining passenger services on some local lines. However, there are still active railways that cross the Minas Gerais, today used only for freight, such as the old Central do Brasil Railway, Leopoldina Railway, Western Minas Railway and Steel Railway, operated by dealers. Railway Center. Atlantic. Vitória a Minas Railway (EFVM) is responsible for transporting the production of Vale and other state companies to the port of Tubarão, in Vitória, Espírito Santo, and also operates the only daily passenger train in Brazil that runs long distances, between Vitória and Belo Horizonte, which connects other cities that also have stations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://g1.globo.com/espirito-santo/noticia/2013/08/ferrovia-vitoria-minas-movimenta-68-milhoes-de-toneladas-em-2013.html|title=Ferrovia Vitória a Minas movimenta 68,5 milhões de toneladas em 2013|first=Do G1|last=ES|date=Aug 12, 2013|website=Espírito Santo|accessdate=Apr 16, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ideiasradicais.com.br/por-que-o-brasil-quase-nao-tem-ferrovias-e-como-mudar-isso/ |title=Por que o Brasil quase não tem ferrovias e como mudar isso |access-date=2022-09-29 |archive-date=2022-06-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220630220619/https://ideiasradicais.com.br/por-que-o-brasil-quase-nao-tem-ferrovias-e-como-mudar-isso/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://exame.com/brasil/por-que-o-brasil-nao-investe-em-ferrovias-e-por-que-deveria-investir/|title=Por que o Brasil não investe em ferrovias?

[[Tancredo Neves International Airport]] is located in the municipalities of Lagoa Santa and [[Confins]], 38&nbsp;km (23&nbsp;mi) from Belo Horizonte, and was opened in January 1984. It was planned from the start for future expansion in steps to meet growing demand. The [[airport]] has one of the lowest rates of shutdown for bad [[weather]] in the country. However, the Confins airport was not using much of its capacity until 2005, when it was decided that a large part of the Pampulha Airport [[flight]]s (which is smaller and located inside Belo Horizonte's urban area) would move to Confins.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www4.infraero.gov.br/aeroportos/aeroporto-internacional-de-confins/|title=Aeroporto Internacional MG|accessdate=Apr 16, 2023|archive-date=September 7, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220907225048/https://www4.infraero.gov.br/aeroportos/aeroporto-internacional-de-confins/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

[[File:Artesanato Mineiro.jpg|thumb|Artesanato]]

Minas Gerais may be called ''Deep Brazil'' by analogy with ''[[France profonde]]''. It has a distinctly more native flavour than cosmopolitan [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], a more traditional slant than flashy [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], and is more Portuguese than the South and São Paulo with their great influx of Italians and other [[Central Europe]]ans, the North with its Native Americans, or the Northeast with its heavy Afro-Brazilian influence.

===People===
Those born and raised in Minas Gerais, also called Mineiros, bear an unmistakable accent that sets them apart from fellow Brazilians, although people born in different regions of the state bear slightly different accents, some resembling those of neighboring states, such as São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Bahia. They are considered reserved, prudent but, at the same time, amicable, welcoming and family-focused. It is one of the most religious states, with a large proportion of staunch [[Roman Catholic]]s and a burgeoning [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] and neo-[[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] population. The [[Spiritist doctrine]] is also professed by a significant portion of the population, partly due to the influence of [[Chico Xavier]], the main spiritual icon of Brazil, who lived in Minas Gerais all his life.

=== Dialects ===
The most spoken dialect (48,6%) in the state is [[mineiro]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mendes |first=Gláucia |title=Diversidade da fala mineira é tema de pesquisa na UFLA |url=https://ufla.br/noticias/pesquisa/12378-diversidade-da-fala-mineira-e-tema-de-pesquisa-na-ufla |access-date=2022-06-15 |website=Portal UFLA |language=pt-br}}</ref> It is the dialect spoken in the capital, Belo Horizonte, and the historical cities (Ouro Preto, Mariana, Sabará, Diamantina, Tiradentes, São João del-Rei etc.). The vernacular, dialectical speech of Minas Gerais is playfully and informally referred to—particularly with regard to its most idiosyncratic features—as {{Lang|pt-BR|mineirês}}.

Other dialects are [[Caipira dialect|caipira]], spoken near the states of São Paulo and Goiás by 33,0%, and baiano, spoken in the Northern region - near Bahia - by 18,4%.

===Museums===
[[File:Inhotim yayoi kusama 05.jpg|thumbnail|[[Yayoi Kusama]] at the [[Inhotim]] in Brumadinho]]
[[Mariano Procópio Museum]], in Juiz de Fora, and [[Centro de Arte Contemporânea Inhotim]], in [[Brumadinho]], are among the most important cultural institutions.

[[File:CachacaDivininha.jpg|thumb|[[Cachaça]], typical drink from Minas Gerais, which has hundreds of artesanal brands]]

Minas Gerais is known nationally for its cuisine. The cultural basis of its cuisine is the small farmhouse, and many of the dishes are prepared using locally produced vegetables and meats, especially chicken and pork. Traditional cooking is done using coal- or wood-fired ovens and cast iron pans, making for a particularly tasty flavor; some restaurant chains have adopted these techniques and made this type of food popular in other parts of the country.<ref name="revistacasaejardim.globo.com">{{Cite web|url=https://revistacasaejardim.globo.com/Casa-e-Comida/Receitas/noticia/2020/07/comida-mineira-14-receitas-tipicas-com-toque-caseiro-de-minas-gerais.html|title=Comida mineira: 14 receitas típicas com toque caseiro de Minas Gerais|website=Casa e Jardim|date=23 September 2022 |accessdate=Apr 16, 2023}}</ref>

Many of the cakes and appetizers of the local cuisine use corn or cassava (known there as ''mandioca'') flour instead of wheat, as the latter did not adapt well to the local weather. The best-known dish from Minas Gerais is "[[pão de queijo]]", a small baked roll (known internationally as "Brazilian cheese rolls") made with cheese and cassava flour that can be served hot as an appetizer or for breakfast.<ref name="revistacasaejardim.globo.com"/>

The state is also recognized for its [[dulce de leche|doce de leite]], since Minas Gerais is the largest producer of milk in the country. Minas Gerais is also Brazil's most traditional producer of cheese. [[Minas cheese]] is renowned nationwide as the distinct Brazilian cheese. [[Cachaça]] is also a local produce of high importance, with the state owning hundreds of artisanal factories (in Minas and in the neighboring state of São Paulo, there is the world's largest production of sugar cane, the basis of cachaça production).<ref name="g1.globo.com">{{Cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/mg/zona-da-mata/especial-publicitario/emporio-bahamas/noticia/2021/09/20/cachaca-mineira-tradicao-que-se-reinventa.ghtml|title=Cachaça mineira: tradição que se reinventa|website=G1|date=20 September 2021 |accessdate=Apr 16, 2023}}</ref> Typical of the state are Tropeiro [[beans]] with [[Pork rind|torresmo]], Tutu de Feijão (Bean's Tutu), chicken with [[okra]] stew, galinhada, a rice dish cooked with chicken corn and peas, handmade cheeses, [[goiabada]], [[paçoca]], [[pamonha]], [[Rice pudding|arroz com leite]] and others. Outside of Minas Gerais it is common to find restaurants specializing in food from the state.<ref name="revistacasaejardim.globo.com"/><ref name="g1.globo.com"/>

The state cuisine is showcased in various festivals year round and in many locations throughout the state, but the biggest festival is the month-long [[Comida de Buteco]] in Belo Horizonte, where 41 bars and restaurants are selected to create a dish using ingredients traditional to local cuisine. People from all over the country and abroad rate the food, the temperature of the beer, the ambiance and service. In 2007, over 400,000 people participated in the festival according to [[Vox Populi]] statistics.

==Flag==
{{Main|Flag of Minas Gerais}}
The flag of the state of Minas Gerais is the oldest one adopted in Brazil that was devised by Brazilians. It was remembered by the Republican Party, which opposed the Brazilian [[Brazilian Empire|Imperial Government]], and adopted unofficially as the flag of the state. It has been the official state flag since 1963.<ref name=flag>[http://www.mg.gov.br/governomg/portal/c/governomg/conheca-minas/5661-nossos-simbolos/26841-bandeira/5146/5044 Minas Flag] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215093901/http://www.mg.gov.br/governomg/portal/c/governomg/conheca-minas/5661-nossos-simbolos/26841-bandeira/5146/5044 |date=2012-12-15 }}, Minas Gerais Government {{in lang|pt}}</ref>

The flag's Latin inscription, "Libertas quæ sera tamen", means "Freedom albeit late", and was the motto of the Minas Gerais Conspiracy, which fought for Minas' independence from Portugal in the 18th century. The phrase was taken from [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Eclogues]]'' 1.30. The triangle is said to represent the [[Holy Trinity]].<ref name=flag /> The colors were chosen for their revolutionary meaning: white represents the desire to form a peaceful nation, discarding all colonial institutions, and red the flame of liberty or the blood of the revolutionary martyrs such as Tiradentes.

==Cities==
{{Main|List of municipalities in Minas Gerais}}
In spite of not being the largest state of Brazil and ranking second in population, Minas Gerais has the largest number of cities. Of the more than 5,500 municipalities in the country, Minas has 853 of them, a fact explained by the number of inhabitants and by the vast territory, comparable in area to Madagascar and larger than Metropolitan France. The most notable cities are: the capital [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Contagem]], [[Betim]], [[Juiz de Fora]], [[Varginha]], [[Muriaé]], [[Montes Claros]], [[Uberlândia]], [[Governador Valadares]], [[Ipatinga]], [[Ouro Preto]], [[Sete Lagoas]], [[Uberaba]], [[Araxá]], [[Patos de Minas]], [[Divinópolis]], [[Barbacena]], [[Itabira]], [[Pouso Alegre]], [[Janaúba]], [[Teófilo Otoni]], [[Conselheiro Lafaiete]], [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]], [[Poços de Caldas]] and [[São João del-Rei]].
