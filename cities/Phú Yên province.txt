'''Phú Yên''' is a central coastal [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] in the [[South Central Coast]] region, in [[Central Vietnam]]. It borders [[Bình Định]] to the north, [[Khánh Hòa province|Khánh Hòa]] to the south, [[Gia Lai]] to the northwest, [[Đắk Lắk]] to the southwest and the [[South China Sea|East Sea]] to the east.

== History ==
Phú Yên formerly belonged to [[Champa]] territory as '''Ayaru,''' a part of Kauthara polity.

In 1611, [[Nguyễn Hoàng|Nguyen Hoang]] sent his general [[Van Phong]] to attack Ayaru. [[Champa]] failed and Nguyen Hoang annexed Ayaru into [[Đàng Trong|Dang Trong]] and he named it ''Phú Yên'', which means a prosperous and peaceful land.

==Geography==
Phú Yên province contains two passes: [[Cù Mông Pass|Cù Mông pass]] in the north and [[Cả Pass|Cả pass]] in the south.

The province's topography consists of hilly regions in the west (70%) and the fertile plain of Tuy Hòa in the east. Lowlands also extend west along [[Đà Rằng River]].<ref name=Atlat> ''Atlat Dia li Viet Nam'' (Geographical Atlas of Vietnam). NXB Giao Duc, Hanoi: 2010</ref> The highest peaks are at 1,592 m on the border of [[Khánh Hòa province]] in the south and at 1,331 m in the northwest ([[Đồng Xuân District]]).<ref name="atlas10">Viet Nam Administrative Atlas. Cartographic Publishing House, Hanoi 2010</ref> There are several hills near the coast, including Mô Cheo (Núi Mô Cheo, 814 m) in [[Sông Cầu]] and Đá Bia (Núi Đá Bia, 706 m) near [[Đại Lãnh]] in [[Đông Hòa District]].<ref name="atlas10"/>

The main rivers that flow across Phú Yên are the [[Đà Rằng River]] (the largest river in Central Vietnam), [[Bàn Thạch River]] and [[Kỳ Lộ River]]. Sông Hinh Lake, a large artificial lake, is located in the southwest of the province.<ref name=Atlat/>

Phú Yên has various picturesque landscapes, such as the Ô Loan Lagoon, Sông Cầu coconut ranges, Đá Bia and Nhạn mountains, Rô Bay, Xep Beach, and Long Thủy Beach.

The beautiful nature of Phú Yên has been used for the movie ''[[Yellow Flowers on the Green Grass]]'', which is adapted from the same novel by [[Nguyễn Nhật Ánh]].

==Administrative divisions==

Phú Yên is subdivided into nine district-level sub-divisions:

* 6 districts:
{{div col}}
:* [[Đồng Xuân District|Đồng Xuân]]
:* [[Phú Hòa District|Phú Hòa]]
:* [[Sơn Hòa District|Sơn Hòa]]
:* [[Sông Hinh District|Sông Hinh]]
:* [[Tây Hòa District|Tây Hòa]]
:* [[Tuy An District|Tuy An]]
{{div col end}}
* 2 district-level towns:
** [[Đông Hòa District|Đông Hòa]]
** [[Sông Cầu]]
* 1 provincial city:
** [[Tuy Hòa]] (capital)

They are further subdivided into eight commune-level towns (or townlets), 88 communes, and 16 wards.

==Demography==
As of 2007 Phú Yên has a population of 880,700. It has a relatively small urban population (178,600), making up 20% of the province's population. With 174 people per square kilometer, it is also one of the least densely populated provinces of the South Central Coast.<ref name="GSO09"/> Population density is relatively high (exceeding 500/km<sup>2</sup>) along the lower [[Đà Rằng River]], but is lower than 50/km<sup>2</sup> in much of the western part of the province.<ref name=Atlat/> Average yearly population growth between 2000 and 2007 has been 1.3%, close to the regional average.<ref name="GSO09calc"/> Urban population growth has been faster with 2.2% per year on average.<ref name="GSO09calc"/>

The vast majority of the population is ethnic [[Kinh]]. There are also minorities of [[Cham people|Cham]], [[E De people|E De]], and [[Ba Na people|Ba Na]] people. Significant minorities of Cham live in [[Đồng Xuân District]] and [[Sơn Hòa District]] and [[E De people]] in [[Sông Hinh District]] and Sơn Hòa District.<ref name=minority>General Statistics Office (1996): Population Data of Sparsely Populated Areas in Vietnam. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> Much smaller communities of Ba Na people also live in these three districts.<ref name=minority/>

==Economy==
With a [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] per capita of 8.43 million [[VND]]<ref name=GSO09calc>calculations based on General Statistics Office (2009): ''Socio-economical Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities''. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref> in 2007 and a relatively small industrial sector, Phú Yên is one of the less developed provinces of the [[South Central Coast]].

Phú Yên has had a trade deficit. In 2007, it exported goods worth US$72.7 million while importing goods worth US$116.25 million, mainly fuel, raw materials, machinery, and medical goods.<ref name="GSO09">General Statistics Office (2009): Socio-economic Statistical Data of 63 Provinces and Cities, Vietnam. Statistical Publishing House, Hanoi</ref>

Total employment was at 482,800 in 2007. The vast majority (361,400) are still employed in agriculture, forestry, and fishing. 45,600 people were employed in industry and construction and 75,800 in the service sector. Both industry and service have shown little employment growth between 2005 and 2007. Service employment has actually declined significantly since 2000.<ref name=GSO09/>

===Agriculture, forestry and fishing===
The main agricultural regions of the province are the plains around [[Tuy Hòa]] and the lowlands along the [[Đà Rằng River]].<ref name=Atlat/> In 2007 the rice harvest was 321,800 t.<ref name="GSO09"/> It is the South Central Coast's largest producer of sugar-cane with a harvest of 1.051 million t (6% of Vietnam's total harvest). Cultivation of cotton and tobacco is also significant, with 800 t (5% of the national total) and 700 t (2.2%) respectively.<ref name=GSO09calc/> Other crops include peanuts, cashew nuts, pepper, and coffee.<ref name=GSO09/>

Phú Yên has a relatively large fishing sector. Its [[gross output]] is the third largest in the South Central Coast after [[Khánh Hòa province]] and [[Bình Định province]].<ref name=GSO09/> Aquaculture, mostly shrimp farms, make up around one third of the fishing output, while using 2300 ha.<ref name=GSO09/>

===Industry===
Phú Yên is one of the less industrialized provinces of the South Central Coast. Its industrial production is mostly based on the processing of local primary products such as fish, shrimp, cashew nuts and sugar. The province also produces mineral water, beer, garments, and cement.<ref name=GSO09/> Industrial parks are located in the north of [[Tuy Hòa]] and [[Sông Cầu]], near [[Qui Nhơn]].<ref name=Atlat/>

The province is zoning and developing a large economic zone, namely the [[Nam Phú Yên Economic Zone]] in southern [[Đông Hòa District]].<ref name=Atlat/> Upon completion, it will become an oil-refining hub in Vietnam and potentially provide high profits for the province.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Infrastructure==

===Transport===
[[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|National Route 1]] as well as the [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|North–South Railway]] run through the province. Phú Yên's main railway station is [[Tuy Hòa Railway Station]]. Smaller railway stations are located in [[Đồng Xuân District]] and [[Tuy An District]] north of [[Tuy Hòa]].<ref name="atlas10"/> National Road 25 connects Tuy Hòa to [[Chư Sê]] in [[Gia Lai province]], mostly along the [[Đà Rằng River]].<ref name="Road Atlas 2004">''Vietnam Road Atlas'' (Tập Bản đồ Giao thông Đường bộ Việt Nam). Cartographic Publishing House (Vietnam), 2004</ref>

[[Đông Tác Airport]], a small domestic airport, is located south of [[Tuy Hòa]].

The province has a port around 28&nbsp;km south of Tuy Hòa, namely [[Vũng Rô Port]] ({{lang-vi|Cảng Vũng Rô}}).<ref name="Road Atlas 2004"/>

===Energy===
A hydropower plant is located in [[Sông Hinh District]] in the southwest of Phú Yên.<ref name=Atlat/> It is built on the [[Hinh River]], a major tributary of the [[Đà Rằng River]] and which created a lake of the same name (Sông Hinh Lake, meaning River Hinh Lake). Phú Yên produced 379.9 million kWh of electricity in 2007.<ref name="GSO09"/>
