The history of Tripoli dates back at least to the 14th century BCE. It was called Athar by the [[Phoenicians]], and later ''Tripolis'' by the [[Greeks|Greek]] settlers, whence the modern Arabic name ''Ṭarābulus'' derives. In the [[Arab world]], Tripoli has been historically known as {{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Ṭarābulus ash-Shām}} ({{Langx|ar|طرابلس الشام||[[Syria (region)|Levantine]] Tripoli|links=no}}), to distinguish it from [[Tripoli, Libya|its Libyan counterpart]], known as {{transl|ar|ALA-LC|Ṭarābulus al-Gharb}} ({{Langx|ar|طرابلس الغرب‎||Tripoli of the West|links=no}}).

Landmarks of Tripoli include the [[Mansouri Great Mosque]] and the [[Citadel of Tripoli]], which is the largest [[crusader castle]] in Lebanon. The city has the second highest concentration of [[Mamluk architecture]] after [[Cairo]]. Tripoli also holds a string of four small islands offshore, the [[Palm Islands Nature Reserve|Palm Islands]], which were declared a [[protected area]] because of their status as a haven for endangered loggerhead turtles (''Caretta caretta''), rare monk seals and [[migratory birds]]. Tripoli borders the city of [[El Mina]], the port of the Tripoli District, which it is geographically conjoined with to form the greater Tripoli conurbation.

With the formation of Lebanon and the 1948 breakup of the Syrian–Lebanese customs union, Tripoli, once on par in economic and commercial importance to Beirut, was cut off from its traditional trade relations with the Syrian hinterland and therefore declined in relative prosperity.<ref name="mafhoum.com">{{cite magazine|author=Gary C.

According to classical writers [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[Pliny the Elder]], and [[Strabo]], the city was founded by combining colonies from three different Phoenician cities – [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]], [[Sidon]] and [[Arwad]]. These colonies were each a [[Stadion (unit)|stadion]] ({{circa|180 m}}) apart from each other, and the combined city became known as 'Triple City', or ''Trípolis'' ({{lang|grc|Τρίπολις}}) in [[Greek language|Greek]].<ref name="John Murray (Firm) Porter 1868 p. 549">{{cite book | author=John Murray (Firm) | last2=Porter | first2=J.L. | title=A Handbook for Travellers in Syria and Palestine: Including an Account of the Geography, History, Antiquities, and Inhabitants of These Countries, the Peninsula of Sinai, Edom, and the Syrian Desert; with Detailed Descriptions of Jerusalem, Petra, Damascus, and Palmyra | issue=v. 2 | year=1868 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5YRRClTo3E4C&pg=PA549 | access-date=2022-10-04 | page=549|quote=Tripoli, according to ancient writers (Diodorus Siculus, Pliny, and Strabo), originally consisted of three quarters, a stadium distant from each other, and founded respectively by colonies from Aradus, Sidon, and Tyre – hence its name, “the Triple City.”}}</ref>

[[File:OldTripoli.jpg|thumb|Overview of historical districts in Tripoli]]

Evidence of settlement in Tripoli dates back as early as 1400 BCE. Tripoli was originally established as a Phoenician colony in the 8th century BC.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Luz |first=Nimrod |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QJ9cAwAAQBAJ&dq=tripoli+originally+established+as+a+phoenician+colony&pg=PA36 |title=The Mamluk City in the Middle East: History, Culture, and the Urban Landscape |date=2014-04-28 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-04884-3 |language=en}}</ref> There, the [[Phoenicians]] established a trading station and later, under [[Persian Empire|Persian]] rule, the city became the center of a confederation of the Phoenician city-states of [[Sidon]], [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]], and [[Arwad|Arados]] Island. Under [[Hellenistic]] rule, Tripoli was used as a naval shipyard and the city enjoyed a period of autonomy. It came under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule around 64 BCE. The [[551 Beirut earthquake]] and tsunami destroyed the [[Byzantine]] city of Tripoli along with other Mediterranean coastal cities.

Tripoli was [[Muslim conquest of the Levant#Conquest of Palestine|conquered by an Arab Muslim army]] in 635. During [[Umayyad]] rule, Tripoli became a commercial and shipbuilding center. It achieved semi-independence under [[Fatimid]] rule, when it developed into a center of learning. The [[Crusaders]] laid siege to the city at the beginning of the 12th century and were able finally to enter it in 1109. This caused extensive destruction, including the burning of Tripoli's famous library, [[Dar al-'Ilm]] (House of Knowledge), with its thousands of volumes. During the Crusaders' rule the city became the capital of the [[County of Tripoli]]. In 1289, it fell to the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]] and the old port part of the city was destroyed. A new inland city was then built near the old castle. During [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule from 1516 to 1918, it retained its prosperity and commercial importance. Tripoli and all of Lebanon was under [[French Mandate of Lebanon|French mandate]] from 1920 until 1943 when Lebanon achieved independence.

===Ancient period===
Many historians reject the presence of any [[Phoenicia]]n civilization in Tripoli before the 8th (or sometimes 4th) century BCE. Others argue that the north–south gradient of Phoenician port establishments on the Lebanese coast indicates an earlier age for the Phoenician Tripoli.

Tripoli has not been extensively excavated because the ancient site lies buried beneath the modern city of [[El Mina]]. However, a few accidental finds are now in museums. Excavations in El Mina revealed skeletal remains of ancient [[Gray wolf|wolves]], [[eels]], and [[gazelles]], part of the ancient southern port quay, [[grinding mill]]s, different types of columns, wheels, bows, and a [[necropolis]] from the end of the [[Hellenistic period]]. A sounding made in the Crusader castle uncovered [[Late Bronze Age]], [[Iron Age]], in addition to [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Byzantine]], and [[Fatimid]] remains. At the Abou Halka area (at the southern entrance of Tripoli) refuges dating to the early (30,000 years old) and middle [[Stone Age]] were uncovered.<ref name="Saliba, R. 1995">Saliba, R., Jeblawi, S., and Ajami, G., ''Tripoli the Old City: Monument Survey – Mosques and Madrasas; A Sourcebook of Maps and Architectural Drawings'', Beirut: American University of Beirut Publications, 1995. {{Page needed|date=October 2016}}</ref>

[[File:Tarabulus ruins.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins in Tripoli]] 
Tripoli became a financial center and main port of northern Phoenicia with sea trade (East Mediterranean and the West), and caravan trade (North Syria and hinterland).

Under the [[Seleucids]], Tripoli gained the right to mint its own coins (112 BCE); it was granted autonomy between 104 and 105, which it retained until 64 BCE. At the time, Tripoli was a center of shipbuilding and [[Cedrus libani|cedar]] timber trade (like other Phoenician cities).

During the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] period, Tripoli witnessed the construction of important public buildings including a municipal stadium or gymnasium due to the strategic position of the city midway on the imperial coastal highway leading from [[Antioch]] to [[Acre, Israel|Ptolemais]]. In addition, Tripoli retained the same configuration of three distinct and administratively independent quarters ([[Aradians]], [[Sidon]]ians, and [[Tyrians]]). The territory outside the city was divided between the three quarters.

===Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid periods===
Tripoli gained in importance as a trading centre for the whole Mediterranean after it was inhabited by the [[Arabs]]. Tripoli was the port city of [[Damascus]]; the second military port of the Arab Navy, following [[Alexandria]]; a prosperous commercial and shipbuilding center; a wealthy principality under the [[Kutama]] [[Ismaili]] Shia [[Banu Ammar]] [[emir]]s.<ref>{{cite book |author1=William Harris |title=Lebanon: A History, 600–2011 |date=19 Jul 2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195181111 |page=49 |edition=illustrated}}</ref> Legally, Tripoli was part of the jurisdiction of the military province of [[Damascus]] ([[Jund Dimashq]]).<ref>Tadmouri, O.

The Jewish community of Tripoli traces its roots back to the seventh century, as recounted by the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid]]-era historian [[al-Baladhuri]]. During the caliphate of [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun]] caliph [[Uthman]] (644–655), the governor of Syria, Mu'awiya, settled Jews in Tripoli, fostering amicable relations with the majority [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]]. However, during the persecution of dhimmis by the Shi'ite [[Fatimid Caliphate|Fatimid]] caliph [[Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah|al-Hakim]] (996–1021), the synagogue faced conversion into a mosque. Notably, during the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] invasion in the 1070s, Tripoli served as a refuge for Jews from Palestine, as documented in [[Cairo Geniza]] records.<ref name=":03">{{Cite book |last=Schulze |first=Kirsten |url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/*-SIM_0007390 |title=Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World |publisher=Brill Reference Online |editor-last=Stillman |editor-first=Norman A. |chapter=Sidon|date=October 2010 }}</ref>

===Crusader period===
{{main|County of Tripoli}}
[[File:TripoliLebCitadel1.jpg|thumb|right|210px|[[Citadel of Tripoli]]]]

During the [[Crusade]] period, the city became the chief town of the [[County of Tripoli]] (a [[Crusader state]] founded by [[Raymond of Saint-Gilles]]) extending from [[Byblos]] to [[Latakia]] and including the plain of [[Akkar]] with the famous [[Krak des Chevaliers]]. Tripoli was also the seat of a [[Diocese|bishopric]]. Tripoli was home to a busy port and was a major center of silk weaving, with as many as 4,000 looms. Important products of the time included lemons, oranges, and sugar cane. For 180 years, during the [[Franks|Frankish]] rule, [[Occitan language|Occitan]] was among the languages spoken in Tripoli and neighboring villages.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lewis |first=Kevin James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UzMlDwAAQBAJ&dq=Occitan+spoken+in+Tripoli&pg=PA80 |title=The Counts of Tripoli and Lebanon in the Twelfth Century: Sons of Saint-Gilles |date=2017-04-21 |publisher=Taylor & Francis |isbn=978-1-317-05260-9 |language=en}}</ref> At that time, Tripoli had a heterogeneous population including [[Western Europe]]ans, [[Greeks]], [[Armenians]], [[Maronites]], [[Nestorian Christians|Nestorians]], [[History of the Jews in Lebanon|Jews]], and [[Islam in Lebanon|Muslims]].

During that time, Tripoli witnessed the growth of the inland settlement surrounding the "Pilgrim's Mountain" (the [[Citadel of Tripoli]]) into a built-up suburb including the main religious monuments of the city such as: The "Church of the Holy Sepulchre of Pilgrim's Mountain" (incorporating the Shiite shrine), the Church of Saint Mary of the Tower, and the [[Carmelite Church]]. The state was a major base of operations for the military order of the [[Knights Hospitaller]], who occupied the famous castle [[Krak Des Chevaliers]] (today a [[UNESCO]] world heritage site). The state ceased to exist in 1289, when it was captured by the [[Egypt]]ian [[Mamluk]] sultan [[Qalawun]].

The mid-twelfth century earthquake led to the death of many Jews in Tripoli, as noted by Jewish explorer [[Benjamin of Tudela]].<ref name=":032">{{Cite book |last=Schulze |first=Kirsten |url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopedia-of-jews-in-the-islamic-world/*-SIM_0007390 |title=Encyclopedia of Jews in the Islamic World |publisher=Brill Reference Online |editor-last=Stillman |editor-first=Norman A. |chapter=Tripoli, Lebanon|date=October 2010 }}</ref>

Tripoli became a major trading port of Syria supplying Europe with candy, loaf and powdered sugar (especially during the latter part of the 14th century). The main products from agriculture and small industry included citrus fruits, olive oil, soap, and textiles (cotton and silk, especially [[velvet]]).

The [[Mamluks]] formed the ruling class holding main political, military and administrative functions. Arabs formed the population base (religious, industrial, and commercial functions) and the general population included the original inhabitants of the city, immigrants from different parts of the Levant, [[North Africans]] who accompanied [[Qalawun]]'s army during the liberation of Tripoli, [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity in Lebanon|Eastern Orthodox Christians]], some [[Western culture|Western]] families, and a minority of [[History of the Jews in Lebanon|Jews]]. The population size of Mamluk Tripoli is estimated at 20,000–40,000; against 100,000 in each of Damascus and Aleppo.<ref name="Tadmouri, O 1984"/>

Mamluk Tripoli witnessed a high rate of urban growth and a fast city development (according to traveler's accounts). It also had poles of growth including the fortress, the [[Mansouri Great Mosque|Great Mosque]], and the river banks. The city had seven guard towers on the harbor site to defend the inland city, including what still stands today as the [[Lion Tower]]. During the period the castle of Saint-Gilles was expanded as the Citadel of Mamluk Tripoli. The "Aqueduct of the Prince" was reused to bring water from the Rash'in spring. Several bridges were constructed and the surrounding orchards expanded through marsh drainage. Fresh water was supplied to houses from their roofs.

The urban form of Mamluk Tripoli was dictated mainly by climate, site configuration, defense, and urban aesthetics. The layout of major thoroughfares was set according to prevailing winds and topography. The city had no fortifications, but heavy building construction characterized by compact urban forms, narrow and winding streets for difficult city penetration. Residential areas were bridged over streets at strategic points for surveillance and defense. The city also included many loopholes and narrow slits at street junctions.

The religious and secular buildings of Mamluk Tripoli comprise a fine example of the architecture of that time. The oldest among them were built with stones taken from 12th and 13th-century churches; the characteristics of the architecture of the period are best seen in the mosques and [[madrassas]], the Islamic schools. It is the madrassas which most attract attention, for they include highly original structures as well as decoration: here a honeycombed ceiling, there a curiously shaped corniche, doorway or moulded window frame. Among the finest is the madrassa al-Burtasiyah, with an elegant façade picked out in black and white stones and a highly decorated lintel over the main door.

[[File:The city of Tripoli, Lebanon.jpg|thumb|left|210px|East Tripoli]]
Public buildings in Mamluk Tripoli were emphasized through sitting, façade treatment, and street alignment. Well-cut and well-dressed stones (local sandstone) were used as media of construction and for decorative effects on elevations and around openings (the [[ablaq]] technique of alternating light and dark stone courses). Bearing walls were used as vertical supports. Cross vaults covered most spaces from prayer halls to closed rectangular rooms, to galleries around courtyards. Domes were constructed over conspicuous and important spaces like tomb chambers, [[mihrab]], and covered courtyards. Typical construction details in Mamluk Tripoli included cross vaults with concave grooves meeting in octagonal openings or concave rosettes as well as simple cupolas or ribbed domes. The use of double drums and corner [[squinch]]es was commonly used to make the transition from square rooms to round domes.<ref name="Saliba, R. 1995"/>

Decorations in Mamluk buildings concentrated on the most conspicuous areas of buildings: [[minaret]]s, portals, windows, on the outside, and mihrab, [[qiblah]] wall, and floor on the inside. Decorations at the time may be subdivided into structural decoration (found outside the buildings and incorporate the medium of construction itself such as ablaq walls, plain or zigzag moldings, fish scale motifs, [[joggling (architecture)|joggled]] lintels or voussoirs, inscriptions, and [[muqarna]]s) and applied decoration (found inside the buildings and include the use of marble marquetry, stucco, and glass mosaic).<ref name="Saliba, R. 1995"/>

Mosques evenly spread with major concentration of madrasas around the Mansouri Great Mosque. All [[Caravanserai|khans]] were located in the northern part of the city for easy accessibility from roads to Syria. [[Turkish bath|Hammam]]s (public baths) were carefully located to serve major population concentrations: one next to the Grand Mosque, the other in the center of the commercial district, and the third in the right-bank settlement.

About 35 monuments from the Mamluk city have survived to the present day, including mosques, madrasas, khanqahs, hammams, and caravanserais, many of them built by local Mamluk amirs.<ref name=":0" /> Major buildings in Mamluk Tripoli included six congregational mosques (the Mansouri Great Mosque, [[al-Aattar]], [[Taynal Mosque|Taynal]], [[al-Uwaysiyat]], [[al-Burtasi]], and [[al-Tawbat]] Mosques). Sultan [[al-Ashraf Khalil]] (r. 1290–93) founded the city's first congregational mosque in memory of his father (Qalawun), in either late 1293 or 1294 (693 AH).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jami' al-Mansuri al-Kabir |url=https://archnet.org/sites/1702 |access-date=2021-06-13 |website=Archnet}}</ref><ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last=Mahamid |first=Hatim |date=2009 |title=Mosques as higher educational institutions in Mamluk Syria |journal=Journal of Islamic Studies |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=188–212 |doi=10.1093/jis/etp002}}</ref> Six madrasas were later built around the mosque.<ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4">{{Cite book |last=Mohamad |first=Danah |url=https://acikerisim.uludag.edu.tr/bitstream/11452/15326/3/Danah%20Mohamad.pdf |title=Review of the Development and Change of Tripoli Bazaar in Lebanon |publisher=Bursa Uludağ University (Master's thesis) |year=2020 |pages=81}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Qantara – Madrasa al-Qartâwîyya |url=https://www.qantara-med.org/public/show_document.php?do_id=347 |access-date=2021-06-13 |website=www.qantara-med.org}}</ref> The Mamluks did not fortify the city with walls but restored and reused a [[Citadel of Raymond de Saint-Gilles|Crusader citadel]] on the site.<ref name=":2" /> In addition, there were two quarter mosques ([[Abd al-Wahed]] and [[Arghoun Shah]]), and two mosques that were built on empty land (al-Burtasi and al-Uwaysiyat). Other mosques incorporated earlier structures (churches, khans, and shops). Mamluk Tripoli also included 16 madrasas of which four no longer exist (al-Zurayqiyat, al-Aattar, al-Rifaiyah, and al-Umariyat). Six of the madrasas concentrated around the Grand Mosque. Tripoli also included a [[Khanqah]], many secular buildings, five Khans, three hammams ([[Turkish bath]]s) that are noted for their cupolas. Hammams were luxuriously decorated and the light streaming down from their domes enhances the inner atmosphere of the place.

===Ottoman period===
{{Main|Tripoli Eyalet}}
[[File:Tripolis in Syrien - Peeters Jacob - 1690.jpg|thumb|Tripoli in 1690]]
[[File:Tripoli gold bezant in Arabic 1270 1300 Tripoli silver gros 1275 1287.jpg|thumb|Tripoli gold [[bezant]] in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] (1270–1300), and Tripoli silver [[Gros (coinage)|gros]] (1275–1287), [[British Museum]]]]

During the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, Tripoli became the provincial capital and chief town of the [[Eyalet of Tripoli]], encompassing the coastal territory from Byblos to [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]] and the inland Syrian towns of [[Homs]] and [[Hama]]; the two other eyalets were [[Aleppo Eyalet]], and [[Şam Eyalet]]. Until 1612, Tripoli was considered as the port of Aleppo. It also depended on Syrian interior trade and tax collection from mountainous hinterland. Tripoli witnessed a strong presence of French merchants during the 17th and 18th centuries and became under intense inter-European competition for trade. Tripoli was reduced to a sanjak centre in the [[Vilayet of Beirut]] in 19th century and retained her status until 1918 when it was captured by British forces.

Public works in Ottoman Tripoli included the restoration of the [[Citadel of Tripoli]] by [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman I]], the Magnificent. That was the only major project during 400 years of Ottoman Rule. Later governors brought further modifications to the original Crusader structure used as garrison center and prison. Khan al-Saboun (originally a military barrack) was constructed in the center of the city to control any uprising. Ottoman Tripoli also witnessed the development of the southern entrance of the city and many buildings, such as the al-Muallaq or "hanging" Mosque (1559), al-Tahhan Mosque (early 17th century), and al-Tawbah mosque (Mamluk construction, destroyed by 1612 flood and restored during early Ottoman Period). It also included several secular buildings, such as Khan al-Saboun (early 17th century) and Hammam al-Jadid (1740).

=== French Mandate ===
{{Main|Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon}}

After the [[partition of the Ottoman Empire]], the French created the territory of [[Greater Lebanon]], whose borders forcibly separated Tripoli from Syria, a decision that was contested by Tripolitans.<ref name=":5" /> Tripoli's population - mostly Sunni Muslims - found itself isolated in this state dominated by Christians, and so Tripoli developed a strong identity as a bastion for Muslim Arab nationalism and anti-imperialism.<ref name=":5">{{Cite book |last=Gade |first=Tina |title=Sunni City: Tripoli from Islamist Utopia to the Lebanese 'Revolution' |date=November 24, 2022 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9781009222754 |pages=32–37 |language=en}}</ref> During this period, protests demanding reunification with Syria were backed by the [[National Bloc (Syria)|Syrian National Bloc]] until the French cut off their support, resulting in a massive 33 day general strike in 1936.<ref name=":5" />
=== Independent Lebanon ===
Since Lebanese independence was achieved, Tripoli has been mired in a period of extended economic and political decline. Beirut's rise as Lebanon's dominant port deprived Tripoli of its former preeminence as a trade hub, and globalization eroded the city's ability to compete in manufacturing.<ref name=":1" /> [[Lebanese Civil War|Lebanon's civil war]], from 1975 to 1990, hit Tripoli hard. On 15 September 1985 intense fighting broke out between [[Islamic Unification Movement|Tawheed al-Islami]], a [[Sunni]] militia which controlled the harbour and was backed by the [[Palestinian Liberation Organisation|PLO]], and the [[Alawite]] [[Arab Democratic Party (Lebanon)|Arab Democratic Party]]’s militia. The ADP were backed by the [[Lebanese Communist Party|communist]] Red Knights as well as Syrian special forces. After a week of fighting which saw around 150 killed, 4500 wounded and 200,000 people leaving their homes, the Syrians brokered a truce which involved the [[Syrian army]] occupying five key positions and the removal of heavy weapons.<ref>[[Middle East International]] No 259, 27 September 1985, Publishers [[Christopher Mayhew|Lord Mayhew]], [[Dennis Walters|Dennis Walters MP]]; [[Jim Muir]] pp.7,8</ref> The truce broke down on 27 September and Tahweed al-Islami positions where bombarded from [[SSNP]] and Syrian artillery positions in the surrounding hills. On 1 October, following an [[Iran]]ian diplomatic intervention, Tahweed agreed to surrender their heavy weapons and Syrian troops, on 6 October, were deployed throughout the city. A further 350 people had been killed and hundreds more wounded.<ref>Middle East International No 260, 11 October 1985, Publishers [[Christopher Mayhew|Lord Mayhew]], [[Dennis Walters|Dennis Walters MP]]; [[Jim Muir]] pp.10,11</ref>

The Syrian army remained in the city for almost three decades until 2005:<blockquote>As a majority Sunni city with a growing strain of indigenous [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Militant|militancy]], Tripoli suffered some of the Syrians’ cruelest predations at a time when then-President [[Hafez al-Assad]] was engaged in the brutal suppression of Syria’s own [[Muslim Brotherhood in Syria|Muslim Brotherhood]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Simon |first=Alex |date=30 January 2017 |title=The city that didn't know where to start – Tripoli's revolving stalemate |url=https://synaps.network/post/tripoli-lebanon-economy-deadlock |access-date=2021-11-16 |website=synaps.network |language=en}}</ref></blockquote>
Wartime violence and instability triggered waves of emigration and capital flight. It also left Tripoli increasingly isolated, not least due to the dismantling of [[Rail transport in Lebanon|Lebanon's rail network]] and the abandonment of the [[Tripoli railway station]]. The city, moreover, saw little of the post-war reconstruction funding that Prime Minister [[Rafic Hariri]] ushered into Lebanon, with an overwhelming focus on the capital.<ref name=":1" />
[[File:2017-01-14 Tripoli train 1.jpg|thumb|Rusted cars at the [[Tripoli railway station]]]]

In the years since, living conditions in Tripoli have continued to decline. In 2016, the [[United Nations Human Settlements Programme|United Nation's Human Settlements Program]] estimated that 58% of Tripoli's Lebanese residents lived in poverty.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tripoli City Profile {{!}} UN-Habitat |url=https://unhabitat.org/tripoli-city-profile |access-date=2021-11-22 |website=unhabitat.org}}</ref> That already high figure preceded Lebanon's 2019 [[Lebanese liquidity crisis|financial crisis]], which has ratcheted up poverty and food insecurity.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gebeily |first=Maya |title=Portrait of poverty in Lebanon as UN visits poorest place on Med |url=https://news.trust.org/item/20211110125516-fhcly/ |access-date=2021-11-22 |website=Thomson Reuters Foundation}}</ref>

Tripoli's stagnation is attributable, in part, to the city's dysfunctional politics, in which a fragmented array of Sunni political figures (such as [[Saad Hariri]], [[Najib Mikati]], [[Faisal Karami]], and [[Ashraf Rifi]]) vie for influence through competing networks of patronage: "No single leader has been able to assert dominance, leaving city politics to devolve into chaos."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Parreira |first=Christiana |date=23 October 2019 |title=The art of not governing |url=https://www.synaps.network/post/lebanon-protests-uprising-poor-governance |website=Synaps}}</ref>

Tripoli stands as one of Lebanon's less stable cities, marked by recurrent [[Bab al-Tabbaneh–Jabal Mohsen conflict|sectarian tensions among its communities]], notably the Sunni and Alawite populations. The impact of the [[Syrian civil war]], beginning in 2011, has extended into Tripoli, where local Alawites align with the Assad regime, while Lebanese Sunnis support the opposition, resulting in frequent and intense clashes between the two groups.<ref name=":10" />

==Geography==
===Climate===
Tripoli has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] (''Csa'') with mild wet winters and very dry, hot summers. Temperatures are moderated throughout the year due to the warm Mediterranean current coming from Western Europe. Therefore, temperatures are warmer in the winter by around 10&nbsp;°C (18&nbsp;°F) and cooler in the summer by around 7&nbsp;°C (13&nbsp;°F) compared to the interior of Lebanon. Although snow is an extremely rare event that only occurs around once every ten years, hail is common and occurs fairly regularly in the winter. Rainfall is concentrated in the winter months, with the summer typically being very dry.

===Offshore islands===
[[File:Palms Islands.jpg|thumb|[[Palm Islands Nature Reserve]]]]

Tripoli has many offshore islands. [[Palm Islands Nature Reserve|The Palm Islands Nature Reserve]], or the Rabbits' Island, is the largest of the islands with an area of {{cvt|20|ha}}. The name "Araneb" or Rabbits comes from the great numbers of rabbits that were grown on the island during the time of the French mandate early in the 20th century. It is now a nature reserve for green turtles, rare birds and rabbits. Declared as a protected area by [[UNESCO]] in 1992, camping, fire building or other depredation is forbidden. In addition to its scenic landscape, the Palm Island is also a cultural heritage site. Evidence for human occupation, dated back to the Crusader period, was uncovered during 1973 excavations by the General Directorate of Antiquities. The Bakar Islands, also known as Abdulwahab Island, were leased to Adel and Khiereddine Abdulwahab as a shipyard, since the Ottoman rule and until this day a ship and marine contractor. It was also known as St Thomas Island during the Crusades.

The opposite of Palms Island, which is a large flat sandy beach, is [https://www.roydtrip.com/lebanon/swimming/5/ramkeen-island Ramkin Island]. This island is largely made up of cliffs and rocks.

==Architecture==

{{Wide image|Tripoli, Lebanon panromaic.jpg|1000px|{{center|A [[panorama|panoramic]] view of modern Tripoli with its distinctive skyline}}}}

===Citadel of Tripoli===
{{main|Citadel of Tripoli}}

The [[Citadel of Tripoli]] is also known as the Castle of Saint-Gilles ({{langx|ar|قلعة سان جيل}} ''Qalʻat Sān Jīl''; {{langx|fr|Château Saint-Gilles}}), in reference to [[Raymond de Saint-Gilles]], who dominated the city in 1102 and commanded a fortress to be built in which he named Mont Pèlerin (Mount Pilgrim). The original castle was burnt down in 1289, and rebuilt again on numerous occasions and was rebuilt in 1307–08 by Emir [[Essendemir Kurgi]].

Later the citadel was rebuilt in part by the [[Ottoman Empire]] which can be seen today, with its massive Ottoman gateway, over which is an engraving from [[Süleyman the Magnificent]] who had ordered the restoration. In the early 19th century, the Citadel was extensively restored by the Ottoman Governor of Tripoli [[Mustafa Agha Barbar]].

===Clock Tower===
[[File:TelClock.jpg|thumb|The Al-Tell Clock Tower]]

The Clock Tower is one of the most iconic monuments in Tripoli. The tower is located in Al-Tell square, and was gifted to the city by the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]].<ref name=":1" /> It was erected in 1906 to celebrate the 30th year of Abdulhamid II of the Ottoman Empire, like the [[Jaffa Clock Tower]] in Israel and many others throughout the Empire.

The Clock Tower underwent a renovation in 1992, and now the clock tower is again operational.

===Hammams===
[[File:AnNuriHammamTripoliLebanon.jpg|thumb|Hammam an-Nuri Tripoli Lebanon]]

When Tripoli was visited by Ibn Batutah in 1355, he described the newly founded Mamluk city. "Traversed by water-channels and full of’ gardens", he writes, "the houses are newly built. The sea lies two leagues distant, and the ruins of the old town are seen on the sea-shore. It was taken by the Franks, but al-Malik ath-Tháhir (Qala’un) retook it from them, and then laid the place in ruins and built the present town. There are fine baths here.’’

Indeed, the hammams built in Tripoli by the early Mamluk governors were splendid edifices and many of them are still present until today. Some of the more known are:
*Abed
*Izz El-Din
*Hajeb
*Jadid
*An-Nouri, built 1333 by the Mamluk governor Nur El-Din, is located in the vicinity of the Grand Mosque.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tripoli-lebanon.com/nourihammam.html |title=Hammam Al-Nouri |website=Tripoli-Lebanon.com |access-date=2018-01-29 |archive-date=2020-11-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112185331/http://www.tripoli-lebanon.com/nourihammam.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Economy==
Tripoli stands out as one of Lebanon's economically poorest cities, marked by a substantial divide between the affluent and poor residents. The city grapples with elevated unemployment rates, and certain impoverished neighborhoods have become strongholds for Islamist and other radical factions.<ref name=":10" />

===Commerce===
Tripoli, while once economically comparable to Beirut, has declined in recent decades.<ref name="mafhoum.com"/> Organizations such as the Business Incubation Association in Tripoli (BIAT) are currently trying to revive traditional export businesses such as furniture production, artisanal copper goods, soaps, as well as expand new industries such as ICT offshoring and new technological invention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://biatcenter.org/index.php/projects/index |title=Projects :: BIAT |website=biatcenter.org}}</ref>

=== Inequality ===
Tripoli embodies Lebanon's extreme wealth inequality: Although it is one of the country's most concentrated centers of poverty, it is also the hometown of several extravagantly wealthy politicians, notably including Najib Mikati, [[Taha Mikati]] and [[Mohammad Safadi]] who are accused of accumulating their wealth by embezzling government funds.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cornish |first=Chloe |date=2020-10-05 |title=Billionaires and bankrupts: Lebanon's second city highlights inequality |work=Financial Times |url=https://www.ft.com/content/049f55e5-061f-4f8b-9d44-1aff71916f98 |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221210/https://www.ft.com/content/049f55e5-061f-4f8b-9d44-1aff71916f98 |archive-date=2022-12-10 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |access-date=2021-11-22}}</ref>

===The Soap Khan===
[[File:SoapkhanTripoliLebanon.jpg|thumb|The Soap Khan of Tripoli Lebanon]]

The khan, built around a square courtyard decorated with a fountain, houses soap making workshops and shops. At the end of the 15th century, the governor of Tripoli [[Yusuf Sayfa Pasha]] established Khan Al Saboun (the hotel of soap traders). This market was finished at the beginning of the 16th century, the last days of the Mamluk rule. The raw material used for these kinds of soap is olive oil.

===Khan el-Khayyatin–the Tailors' Khan===
Unlike other khans built around a square courtyard, el-Khayyatin, built in the 14th century, is a 60 meter long passage with arches on each side.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tripoli-lebanon.com/khans.html |title=Tripoli-Lebanon.com Tourism-Khans Page |website=www.tripoli-lebanon.com}}</ref>

===Arabic sweets===
Tripoli is regionally known for its Arabic sweets.

==Environmental issues==
{{See also|Marine environmental issues in Lebanon#Oil pollution from ships}}

Lebanese public opinion and Lebanese authorities rarely react to minor [[oil spills]] from [[Merchant navy|merchant ships]] calling at Lebanese ports. Being without inspection, and discharging close to the shore, [[oil tankers]] pollute the coast.<ref>[http://www.lorientlejour.com/article/947890/grave-pollution-petroliere-a-jiyeh.html} The inhabitants observe regularly oïl spills near Jiyeh]</ref> These pollutions have a direct effect on the marine life.
