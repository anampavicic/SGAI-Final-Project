'''Pattaya'''{{efn|{{langx|th|พัทยา}}, {{RTGS|''Phatthaya''}}, {{IPA|th|pʰát.tʰā.jāː|pron|th-pattaya.ogg}}}} is a city in [[Eastern Thailand]], the second-largest city in [[Chonburi province]] and the [[List of municipalities in Thailand|eighth-largest]] city in [[Thailand]]. It is on the east coast of the [[Gulf of Thailand]], about {{convert|100|km}} southeast of [[Bangkok]], and has a population of 328,961 as of 2021.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Department of Provincial Administration พ.ศ.2565 |url=https://www.bora.dopa.go.th/ |access-date=2023-10-02 |language=th}}</ref>

Pattaya City ({{langx|th|เมืองพัทยา}}, {{RTGS|''Mueang Phatthaya''}}, {{IPA|th|mɯ̄a̯ŋ pʰát.tʰā.jāː|pron}}) is a special local government organization area within [[Bang Lamung district]] and has a population of 119,532. It covers the [[tambon|''tambons'']] of Nong Prue and Na Klua and parts of Huai Yai and Nong Pla Lai. Pattaya City has grown into all adjacent [[Tambon|sub-districts]] and accounts for the largest population percentage in the district, making it de facto a part of the "Pattaya-Bang Lamung-Jomtien" area, otherwise known as "Greater Pattaya". 

The city is in the industrial [[Eastern seaboard of Thailand|Eastern seaboard]] zone, along with [[Si Racha]], [[Laem Chabang]], and [[Chonburi]]. Pattaya is at the center of the Pattaya-Chonburi Metropolitan Area (a [[wikt:conurbation|conurbation]] in Chonburi Province with a population of 1,000,000), which forms the third largest metropolitan area in Thailand.

== History ==

=== Name ===
The name ''Pattaya'' evolved from the march of [[Phraya]] Tak (later [[King Taksin]]) and his army from [[Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya Province|Ayutthaya]] to [[Chanthaburi Province|Chanthaburi]], which took place before the fall of the former capital to [[Burma|Burmese]] invaders in 1767. When his army arrived in the vicinity of what is now Pattaya, Phraya Tak encountered the troops of a local leader named Nai Klom, who tried to intercept him. When the two met face to face, Nai Klom was impressed by Phraya Tak's dignified manner and his army's strict discipline. He surrendered without a fight and joined his forces. 

The place the armies confronted each other was thereafter known as "Thap Phraya", which means the "army of the Phraya".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Pattaya History and the Facts |url=https://letsgopattaya.com/pattaya-history/ |access-date=2024-02-11 |website=Lets Go Pattaya}}</ref> Thap Phraya was later changed to ''Phatthaya'', which means 'the wind blowing from the southwest to the northeast at the beginning of the rainy season'.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History |url=https://www.thaiwaysmagazine.com/pattaya/history.html |access-date=2024-02-11 |website=thaiwaysmagazine.com}}</ref>

Following World War II, entrepreneur Parinya Chawalitthamrong saw the potenial of investing in Pattaya and donated some land to the governing administration. Pattaya City Hall would later be constructed on this land.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-07-11 |title=The History of Pattaya from 1787 to 1975 – Siam Royal View Pattaya |url=https://siam-royal-view-pattaya.com/the-history-of-pattaya-from-1787-to-1975/ |access-date=2023-11-07}}</ref>

A fishing village until the 1960s, tourism began during the [[Vietnam War]], when American servicemen began arriving on [[R&R (military)|R&R]] (rest and relaxation). One large group who arrived from a base in [[Nakhon Ratchasima|Korat]] on 29 June 1959 and rented houses from Phraya Sunthorn at the south end of the beach, on what is now known as the "Strip", are credited with recommending Pattaya, whose fame spread by [[word of mouth]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Schauseil|first1=Jan|title=Sattahip and the history of GIs coming to Pattaya|url=http://www.1stoppattaya.com/articles/sattahip_gis/|website=One Stop Pattaya|access-date=12 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724115246/http://www.1stoppattaya.com/articles/sattahip_gis/|archive-date=24 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://thailand.sawadee.com/pattaya/introduction.html |title=Welcome to Pattaya |website=Sawadee.com |date=2018 |access-date=25 February 2020 |archive-date=25 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200225163220/http://thailand.sawadee.com/pattaya/introduction.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On 29 November 1978, Pattaya was granted city status by the Thai government.<ref name=":0" /> In 1978, it also became a special governed city.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-07-31 |title=Pattaya, a former quiet fishing village – Thailand News |url=https://www.thailandnews.co/2022/07/pattaya-a-former-quiet-fishing-village/ |access-date=2024-02-11}}</ref>

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], Pattaya's economy suffered greatly due to travel restrictions restricting tourism.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2020-03-29 |title=Thailand's tourist haven Pattaya devastated as coronavirus hits travel|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-thailand-tourism-idINKBN21G08X |access-date=2023-11-07}}</ref>

From the 2010s through to the 2020s, Pattaya attempted to shift public perception of it being a sex-city to a more family-friendly location. Bars which were friendly towards pedophiles in [[Sunee Plaza|Sunee plaza]] were closed, and the amount of gogo bars on Walking Street declined.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kenyon |first=Barry |date=2023-12-05 |title=Sex scandal in Pattaya: today's news is tomorrow's history |url=https://www.pattayamail.com/news/sex-scandal-in-pattaya-todays-news-is-tomorrows-history-447012 |access-date=2023-12-05 |website=Pattaya Mail}}</ref> However, a 2023 documentary by [[Deutsche Welle]], which has been banned in Thailand, resurrected concerns around Pattaya's sex industry and its association with child prostitution.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Documentary rocks Pattaya tourism |url=https://www.thephuketnews.com/documentary-rocks-pattaya-tourism-90504.php |access-date=5 December 2023 |website=The Phuket News}}</ref> The documentary is around a German tourist who is claimed to have paid ฿‎1 million to return to Germany and escape charges.<ref>{{Cite AV media|title=Thailand: Die Rückkehr der Sextouristen|publisher=Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR)|type=45' video, with transcript|via=YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9m2qg1_-Vk |access-date=2023-12-05 |language=de}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Police probing sex charge bribe claim|work=Bangkok Post |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2697609/police-probing-sex-charge-bribe-claim |access-date=2023-12-05}}</ref> The claims resulted in PM [[Srettha Thavisin]] launching an investigation headed by [[Surachate Hakparn|Surachate Hapkarn]].

Pattaya has frequently suffered from flooding, especially during the [[Wet season|monsoon season]]. Torrential rain on 27 August 2021 left many important roads under water, with water reaching up to two metres deep in some areas. Pattaya City officials called the August flooding as the worst flood for Pattaya in a decade.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Pattaya flooded again, residents vent frustration |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/thailand/general/2178451/pattaya-flooded-again-residents-vent-frustration |access-date=2024-02-11 |work=Bangkok Post}}</ref>

On 4 November 2023, Pattaya was awarded the Integrity and Transparency Assessment award for the highest development category.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Pattaya, Walking Street at night, Thailand.jpg|thumb|left|Pattaya at night]]{{Further|List of municipalities in Thailand}}
The [[Thesaban|municipality]] has a population of 119,532 residents (2019), while the [[Urban area|city]] ("Greater Pattaya") has a population of 328,961 (2021).<ref name="TDD" /> Most of these people counted are Thai, with most migrant populations not recognized, although migrant workers are increasingly regularized due to foreign pressure. Some details of the census remain complex, as even indigenous Thais without nationality are not being recognized. Therefore, the census population currently does not represent the total figure. 

As with the [[Bangkok Metropolitan Region]], registered population figures issued by the National Statistics Office (NSO) and the Department of Provincial Administration (DOPA) hardly capture the scope of the urban transformation that has occurred over time, especially with the economy being dependent on the large numbers of casual Thai workers who work in the city yet remain registered in their hometowns, the employment turnover from and to the capital, as well as seasonal farm migration. Migrant workers from neighboring nations, and many long-term [[expatriate]]s who reside in the city as retirees, self-employed, or contracted are traditionally not counted. There has never been a reliably published figure for the total population in Pattaya, but its thought to be quite large (on the order of half a million people{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}) given the ubiquity and sheer number of migrant workers. Pattaya additionally has a massive population inflow from short stay tourism, with its 2000 hotels and 136,000 rooms available as of 2015.<ref>{{cite news |date=15 July 2015 |title=Chinese put squeeze on Pattaya's hotels |newspaper=Bangkok Post |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/archive/chinese-put-squeeze-on-pattaya-hotels/622728 |url-access=subscription |access-date=12 March 2018}}</ref>

Throughout the years, the municipality (Pattaya City) has outgrown its municipal borders (53.5&nbsp;km²) and now reaches into all neighboring [[Tambon|subdistricts]] (''tambon'') within the [[Bang Lamung district]], forming the "Pattaya-Bang Lamung-Jomtien" area (727&nbsp;km²), also known as "Greater Pattaya", though the commonly used term to describe the urban area is simply Pattaya. Changes in population and area size are regularly revised by the [https://onedptgis.dpt.go.th/onedpt-complain-ppl/ Department of Public Works and Town & Country Planning] and the [https://www.chon.go.th/cpao/ Chonburi Provincial Administrative Organization].

Pattaya is part of the Pattaya-Chonburi Metropolitan Area, a [[conurbation]] of the urban areas of [[Chonburi]], [[Si Racha]] and Pattaya. The total population of this area is 999,092, making it the third largest metropolitan area in the country after [[Bangkok]] and [[Chiang Mai]].

A growing community of foreign [[Pensioner|retirees]] lives in Pattaya. The Thai Immigration Bureau has a special visa category for foreigners over the age of 50 who wish to retire in Thailand.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Retirement Visa in Thailand {{!}} ThaiEmbassy.com |url=https://www.thaiembassy.com/thailand-visa/retirement-visa |access-date=2023-10-02 |website=thaiembassy.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=immigrationAdmin |title=Visa Extension |url=https://www.immigration.go.th/en?p=14714 |access-date=2023-10-02 |website=สำนักงานตรวจคนเข้าเมือง – Immigration Bureau}}</ref> The city also has a large [[Indians in Thailand|Indian community]], which mainly speaks Tamil.

== Physical geography ==
Pattaya, on the Gulf of Thailand, is approximately {{convert|160|km}} south of the city of Bangkok in [[Bang Lamung District]], [[Chonburi Province]].

The city of Pattaya is a special municipal area which covers the whole ''tambon'' [[Nong Prue]] (Nongprue) and Na Kluea (Naklua) and parts of Huai Yai and Nong Pla Lai. [[Bang Lamung township]] which forms the northern border of Pattaya covers parts of the ''tambon'' Bang Lamung (Banglamung), Nong Pla Lai and Takhian Tia. Bang Sare (Bang Saray) is on the southern border of Pattaya.

"Greater Pattaya" occupies most of the coastline of Banglamung (one of the eleven districts that make up Chonburi Province). It is divided into a larger northern section which spans the areas to the east of Naklua Beach (the most northern beach) and Pattaya Beach (the main beach) plus [[Phra Tamnak Hill]] (often called "Buddha Hill" because of the temples on top of the hill) headland immediately south of Pattaya Beach, and a smaller southern section covering the area to the east of Jomtien Beach (directly south of Phra Tamnak Hill).

=== Beaches and islands ===
{{wide image|Pattaya_Bay_Panorama.jpg|1050px|align-cap=center|The Pattaya Bay area is one of Asia's largest beach resorts and the second most visited city in Thailand, after Bangkok. This panorama overlooks Bali Hai pier and the core of the city.}}
[[File:Pattaya Beach, Beach Road, Thailand.jpg|alt=|thumb|Pattaya Beach Road]]
The main sweep of the bay area is divided into two principal [[beachfront]]s. Pattaya Beach lies parallel to the city centre, and runs about 2.7&nbsp;km long from Pattaya Nuea (North) south along the coast to Pattaya Tai (South) which is the entrance to [[Walking Street, Pattaya|Walking Street]]. The beach, which used to be 35&nbsp;m wide, suffers from erosion and in some places was reduced to a width of only two to three meters. A 429 million [[Thai baht|baht]] beach restoration scheme was implemented in 2018. It will take 360,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup> of sand from Ko Rang Kwian offshore to increase the beach width to 50&nbsp;m.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pupattanapong |first1=Chaiyot |title=Restored Pattaya beach lures tourists |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1516086/restored-pattaya-beach-lures-tourists |access-date=5 August 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=5 August 2018}}</ref> 

Without intervention Pattaya will likely see its beaches disappear in roughly ten years according to [[Chulalongkorn University]] researchers. Within a month of the completion of the restoration of the first 400&nbsp;m of Pattaya Beach, the work was "seriously damaged" by flooding. The beach is the first in the country to use imported sand to compensate for coastal erosion. An official said, "...the longer it is left without the flood damage being repaired, the worse it will get."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pupattanapong |first1=Chaiyot |title=Pattaya City beach sand-fill project hit hard by flooding |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1516982/pattaya-city-beach-sand-fill-project-hit-hard-by-flooding |access-date=7 August 2018 |work=Bangkok Post |date=7 August 2018}}</ref>

[[Phra Tamnak Hill]] is on the south side of Pattaya and is popular for its viewpoints and the temple (Wat Phra Yai) on top of the hill. Pattaya Park and Pattaya tower are at the south end of Phra Tamnak Hill and the Pattaya Exhibition And Convention Hall (P.E.A.C.H), is positioned at the north end of Phra Tamnak Hill. In recent years, Phra Tamnak Hill has gained in popularity because of its more natural environment, nicer beaches, and its convenient location between Jomtien and Pattaya city.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

[[Jomtien]] is divided from Pattaya by Thepprasit Road, the southern route into Pattaya city. It consists of high-rise condominiums, beach side hotels, bungalow complexes, shops, bars, and restaurants.

Offshore islands include three "near islands": [[Ko Lan]] (main island), [[Ko Lan|Ko Sak]], and [[Ko Lan|Ko Krok]], {{convert|7|km}} from the shore of Pattaya. The "far islands" are [[Ko Phai]] (main island), [[Ko Phai|Ko Man Wichai]], [[Ko Phai|Ko Hu Chang]] and [[Ko Phai|Ko Klung Badan]], located offshore further west of the "near islands". Ko Rin lies offshore to the south-west, south of Ko Phai group.

In June 2016, the Regional Environmental Office reported that, "The sea water along the busy central Pattaya beaches is of poor quality and could endanger human and marine life."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pupattanapong|first1=Chaiyot|title=Pattaya sea water quality gets 'poor' grade|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1015553/pattaya-sea-water-quality-gets-poor-grade|access-date=21 June 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=21 June 2016}}</ref>

Pattaya produces on the order of 450 [[tonne]]s of solid waste per day. The city spends more than 300 million [[Thai baht|baht]] on waste removal and disposal annually. On average it pays 1,600 baht to process each tonne of garbage.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pupattanapong|first1=Chaiyot|title=Pattaya official thinks garbage figures are rubbish|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1452654/pattaya-official-thinks-garbage-figures-are-rubbish|access-date=26 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=26 April 2018}}</ref> Significant volumes of rubbish are allegedly dumped into the sea by tour boats.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pattaya beach businesses blame tourist boat operators for rising level of garbage being washed ashore|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/around_thailand/30335244|access-date=26 April 2018|work=The Nation|date=2018-01-03|archive-date=6 August 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220806052048/https://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/around_thailand/30335244|url-status=dead}}</ref>
[[File:Flooded street of Pattaya.jpg|thumb|Flooding in Pattaya in October 2012]]
In July 2017 Pattaya Beach was fouled for a week by raw sewage that poured out of a storm drain. City officials blamed the incident on broken pumps and Pattaya's poorly maintained sewage-treatment plant. The environmental ministry declared it would step up enforcement of pollution laws and push Pattaya for better wastewater-treatment efficiency. According to the ministry, Pattaya has 1,047 identified sources of sewage and garbage pollution, the number increasing as the city grows.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Homklin|first1=Jetsada|title=Pattaya sewage problem in government crosshairs|url=http://www.pattayamail.com/news/pattaya-sewage-problem-government-crosshairs-186138|access-date=26 April 2018|work=Pattaya Mail|date=2017-09-16|archive-date=26 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180426213040/http://www.pattayamail.com/news/pattaya-sewage-problem-government-crosshairs-186138|url-status=live}}</ref> 

The sea water along central Pattaya beaches is of poor quality even in the absence of sewage spills and "could endanger human and marine life", the regional environmental office has said. They deemed sea water quality near central Pattaya beaches as "poor" and deteriorating. They judged water quality near Na Klua in North Pattaya, South Pattaya, Ko Lan, and Jomtien Beach as "fairly good". The city has considered expanding two water management plants to increase capacity for better treatment of wastewater prior to discharge into the ocean. The water treatment plant in Soi Wat Nongyai after expansion would be able to treat around 130,000 cubic metres of waste water a day, up from 80,000 cubic metres at present.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pupattanapong|first1=Chaiyot|title=Pattaya sea water quality gets 'poor' grade|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1015553/pattaya-sea-water-quality-gets-poor-grade|access-date=26 April 2018|work=Bangkok Post|date=2016-06-21}}</ref> The expansion was never implemented.<ref name=BP-20181123/>

In November 2018, the Pattaya City Council approved 188 million [[Thai baht|baht]] for the repair of its six wastewater treatment plants. Installed in 2000, the plants can accommodate 65,000 m<sup>3</sup> of wastewater per day. More than a third of plant equipment was found to be 40–50 percent worn out. The system treats waste from a 36&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> portion of Pattaya, or 68 percent of its urban area. Earlier plans to increase treatment capacity to 135,000 m<sup>3</sup> were never implemented and existing plants were allowed to fall into disrepair. Pattaya uses more than 200,000 m<sup>3</sup> of water a day, but claims to only discharge about 70,000 m<sup>3</sup> a day. The discrepancy is unexplained. Once treated, there are no tests to measure water quality before it is dumped back into the sea, which may account for foul water discharges.<ref name=BP-20181123>{{cite news |last1=Pupattanapong |first1=Chaiyot |title=Wastewater stations to get B188m |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/news/general/1580522/wastewater-stations-to-get-b188m |access-date=2018-11-26 |work=Bangkok Post |date=2018-11-23}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Hilton Pattaya Pool dusk view 201801.jpg|thumb|Hotel overlooking Pattaya Bay]]

Pattaya is at the center of Thailand's [[Eastern Economic Corridor]] (EEC). Investments totaling more than 1.5 trillion baht (US$45 billion) are flowing into EEC infrastructure projects: airports, deep-sea ports, high-speed railways, autoroutes. The result will enhance Pattaya's accessibility. According to the Thai Chamber of Commerce (TCC) the EEC investments, the [[U-Tapao International Airport]] and the [[High-speed rail in Thailand|high-speed train]] that will link three major airports to Pattaya, will make Pattaya the heart of the eastern region. The TCC view is that, "Plenty of attractions...will lure lots more foreign and domestic tourists in the future." Better connectivity will reduce both the cost and time to travel to Pattaya, with the TCC estimating the number of tourists visiting the EEC region to rise to 46.7 million over the next few years, one and half times the current 29.8 million visitors. 

Pattaya projects include developing a [[tram]] in the city and building a bigger cruise terminal, as well as new tourist attractions: a water park, an ice dome, cultural markets, Thai boxing gyms, theaters, and conference halls. All are under development. "We aimed to get rid of the previous [seedy] image of Pattaya and try to promote a new image to show that Pattaya is a place for everyone with diversity of new tourist attractions," said an official of the [[Tourism Authority of Thailand]] (TAT). He said that the EEC would make Pattaya more competitive compared with other popular Thai beach destinations such as [[Phuket Province|Phuket]] and [[Ko Samui]], with cheaper transport costs.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Phoonphongphiphat |first1=Apornrath |title=Thai businesses to revitalize Pattaya tourism via economic zone |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-Trends/Thai-businesses-to-revitalize-Pattaya-tourism-via-economic-zone |access-date=7 August 2018 |work=Nikkei Asian Review |date=6 August 2018 |archive-date=7 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180807092751/https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Business-Trends/Thai-businesses-to-revitalize-Pattaya-tourism-via-economic-zone |url-status=live }}</ref>

Fourteen million visitors in 2018 contributed 239 billion [[Thai baht|baht]] to the city's treasury. That represents more than 70% of Pattaya's total income for the year. The city's leadership plans to reduce Pattaya's reliance on tourism to 60% by 2025 by transforming itself into "Neo Pattaya", an international business center. Key to the plans are infrastructure improvements: 9.5 billion baht for flood management projects and upgrading sewage treatment plants to handle 130,000 m<sup>3</sup> of waste per day, up from 67,000 m<sup>3</sup> per day in 2019.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Worrachaddjechai |first1=Dusida |title=Beach resort banking on Neo Pattaya |url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/business/1769219/beach-resort-banking-on-neo-pattaya |access-date=11 October 2019 |work=Bangkok Post |date=10 October 2019}}</ref>

Pattaya's thriving real estate market plays a pivotal role in bolstering the local economy. The continuous growth in the sector, particularly driven by foreign interest in condos, contributes significantly to employment, from construction to property management. Increased property transactions also generate substantial revenue through taxes and fees, further enhancing the city's fiscal health.

During 2020-2022, Pattaya witnessed a limited number of new projects, resulting in high absorption rates. Notably, the second and third quarters of 2023 saw a remarkable uptick in condo launches, significantly elevating sales. In 2023, Pattaya maintained its lead in condo transfers to foreigners, surpassing Bangkok with proportions of 41.7% and 37.5%, respectively. This outperformed the average rates of 30.8% and 48.8% from 2018 to 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-12-20 |title=Pattaya Real Estate Market Poised to Sustain Growth |url=https://century21pattaya.com/blog/pattaya-real-estate-market-poised-to-sustain-growth |access-date=2024-02-24 |website=century21pattaya.com}}</ref>

The 389 Bus (airportpattayabus) service connects Pattaya with Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK). It uses modern, air-conditioned buses, and takes around {{frac|1|1|2}} hours to reach the airport. The trip from the airport (Level 1 Gate 8 at the Arrival Hall) to the bus terminal in Pattaya, makes three stops at North, Central, and South Pattaya intersections before going to their last drop off point, the office on Thappraya Road (near Jomtien). It can take longer if many hotel stops are negotiated along Sukhumvit Road in Pattaya.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://airportpattayabus.com/suvarnabhumi-airport-pattaya-bus-schedule-timetable |title=airportpattayabus 389 Bus |access-date=7 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161107221749/http://airportpattayabus.com/suvarnabhumi-airport-pattaya-bus-schedule-timetable |archive-date=7 November 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The other bus service is the Bell Travel Service (Coach 36) which goes from the airport (Level 1 between Gate 7 & 8) to the Pattaya Bell office at the North Pattaya Intersection, and then provides transfers to local hotels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://belltravelservice.com/|title=Bell Travel Service – Convenient shuttle coach service between Bangkok and Pattaya|access-date=29 May 2020|archive-date=11 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200511085132/https://belltravelservice.com/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Buses from a terminal on Sukhumvit Road near Pattaya Klang (near the Central Pattaya intersection) connect Pattaya with many destinations in the north-east region (i.e. Isan).
