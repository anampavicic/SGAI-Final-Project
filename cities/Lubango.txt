'''Lubango''', formerly known as '''Sá da Bandeira''', is a municipality in [[Angola]], capital of the [[Huíla Province]], with a population of 914,456 in 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/lubango-population |title=Lubango Population 2022 |work=worldpopulationreview |access-date=13 September 2022}}</ref> The city center had a population of 600,751 in 2014<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/angola/cities/ Citypopulation.de] Population of the major cities in Angola</ref> making it the second-most populous city in Angola after the capital city [[Luanda]].

== History ==

===Portuguese rule===
[[File:Canyon in the Huila Plateau, image 5.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Canyon in Lubango.]]
In 1882 approximately one thousand Portuguese settlers came from the island of [[Madeira]] to the area of current-day Lubango. These Portuguese farmers helped develop the region and founded the settlement. The city, originally established in 1885 to serve colonists from the Madeira Islands, lies at an elevation of 1,760 metres in a valley of the [[Huíla Plateau]] and was surrounded by a scenic park spreading up the mountain slopes.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

By 1910 there were over 1,700 ethnic Portuguese living in the settlement, which was referred to as "Lubango". By 1923 the [[Moçâmedes Railway]] had connected the settlement to the town of [[Namibe|Moçâmedes]] in the coast. The Portuguese government made it a city and renamed it "Sá da Bandeira", after [[Bernardo de Sá Nogueira de Figueiredo, 1st Marquess of Sá da Bandeira|Bernardo de Sá, 1st Marquess of Sá da Bandeira]]. Once the major centre of Portuguese settlement, it was built in a Portuguese style of architecture, with a [[cathedral]], [[commerce]] hall, industrial hall, and a [[secondary school]], and, like every Portuguese city or town in the mainland and the overseas territories, it would have the Portuguese town hall, the hospital and the typical [[CTT Correios de Portugal, S.A.|CTT]] post office, besides banking (most prominently the [[Banco Nacional Ultramarino]] - BNU), insurance and other services as well. The city developed as a notable [[agricultural]] and [[transportation]] centre, with its own airport and railway station, as well as major maintenance and repair facilities for them.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}

Several [[Basters]] (children of African and [[Cape Colony]] [[Dutch people|Dutch]] descent) emigrated from Namibia to Angola and settled in Lubango, where they are known as the Ouivamo. Many of them were forced to return to [[Namibia]] between 1928 and 1930 by white South Africans.

In 1951, the Portuguese colony of Angola was officially rebranded the [[Angola (Portugal)|Overseas Province of Angola]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWZi7j1GGQg SáDaBandeiraAnosOuro.wmv], a film of Sá da Bandeira, [[Overseas Province of Angola]], before 1975.</ref>

===Post independence===
After Angola's Independence from Portugal due to the events of the April 25, 1974 [[Carnation Revolution]] in [[Lisbon]], the city was once again renamed Lubango. During the [[Angolan Civil War]] (1975–2002), Lubango served as a major base of [[Cuba]]n, [[SWAPO]] and government troops. Its once thriving economy plummeted.

== Economy ==
Lubango's economy is based on [[agriculture]], especially [[meat]] products, [[cereal]]s, [[sisal]], [[tobacco]], [[fruit]]s and [[vegetable]]s produced in the surrounding fertile region.  Food processing, [[leather]] [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]], and consumer goods industries dominate the industrial sector.

A number of Angolan banks like BAI or BPC offer good financial services, and it is possible to receive funds from outside Angola by way of electronic fund transfer into these banks. ATMs are available around the city but they disburse [[Angolan kwanza|kwanza]], which is the local currency. In the markets US dollars or kwanza both are acceptable.

The main shopping plaza in Lubango is a newly built Mall called "Milleneum", where most products of daily use as well as other products like cosmetics, shoes, clothes etc. are available.

== Transport ==
[[File:Lubango Airport.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lubango Airport]].]]
Lubango is the site of an airport ([[Lubango Airport]] IATA code:SDD) and headquarters for a [[fighter bomber]] regiment of the [[Military of Angola|Angolan Air Force]]. The airport receives daily flights from [[Quatro de Fevereiro Airport|Luanda]] and thrice a week from [[Windhoek Hosea Kutako International Airport|Windhoek, Namibia]] through TAAG, the Angolan airline.

The town is served by the [[Moçâmedes Railway]], known as CFM.  It is the junction for the branch railway to [[Chiange]]. Also the town is serviced by taxis (mostly shared) which run in circles around the city. One can hire personal taxis which are marked "PARTICULAR". Walking around town is also a good way to explore Lubango. Bus services are available from Lubito and the buses run by a firm called "SGO" are pretty comfortable.

== Education and science ==
Lubango is home to two public higher education institutions, namely the [[Mandume ya Ndemufayo University]] and the Higher Institute of Education Sciences of Huíla.<ref>BARRETO, M. A.; COSTA, A. B. II Coopedu Africa e o Mundo: Livro de Atas. Lisboa: ISCTE-IUL/CEA/ESECS-IPL, 2012.</ref>

The town has a Portuguese international school, the ''Escola Portuguesa do Lubango'' (''Portuguese School of Lubango''),<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.dgae.mec.pt/web/14650/angola |title=Escolas com Currículo Português em Angola |publisher=Direção de Serviços de Ensino e Escolas Portuguesas no Estrangeiro (DSEEPE) of the [[Ministry of Education (Portugal)|Portuguese Education Ministry]] |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=pt |access-date=26 October 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150418071338/http://www.dgae.mec.pt/web/14650/angola |archive-date=18 April 2015 }}</ref> and the ''Instituto Superior Politécnico Gregório Semedo'' (''Gregório Semedo Polytechnical Institute'')<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.igs.ed.ao/ |title=Instituto Superior Politécnico Gregório Semedo |editor=ISPGS |language=pt |location=Mapunda, Angola |access-date=2016-11-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104014259/http://www.igs.ed.ao/ |archive-date=2016-11-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> that offers degree courses in various disciplines.
