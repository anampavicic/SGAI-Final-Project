==History==
Settlement began in the first decades of the nineteenth century.  Brejo Alegre was the name of the small village (arraial) composed of some buildings, among them a small chapel, simple houses, a few stores, and a lot of cattle ranches.  In 1843 the village was raised to the status of district with the name of Sant’Ana do Rio das Velhas.

In 1882 the district was declared a "vila" (town) and in 1888 it was raised to the category of "cidade" or city, with the new name of Araguari.
At this time the town consisted of the Igreja Matriz (Main church) of Senhor Bom Jesus da Cana Verde with its colonial style; the cemetery located behind the church; the houses with tiles but no ceilings, called casas de “telhas ao vento”; and in the center flowed a stream dividing the settlement, one part called Goiás, and the other, Minas.  The small commerce consisted of a bakery, a shoe store, two pharmacies and some general stores, called  “vendas”.

The great change in the town's situation occurred with the arrival of the railroad, the Cia. Mogiana de Estrada de Ferro, in 1896.  In 1906 this railroad, called Estrada de Ferro Goiás, was extended to [[Goiás]], further increasing the growth of the city.<ref>[http://panoramaaraguari.blogspot.com/2007/07/araguari-em-dados-e-fotos.html Araguari em dados e fotos]</ref>
