'''Kaduna State''' ({{langx|ha|Jihar Kaduna}}, ÿ¨ŸâŸêŸáŸéÿ± ŸÉŸéÿØŸèŸÜÿß; ŸÖÿØŸäŸÜÿ© ŸÉÿØŸàŸÜÿß; {{langx|ff|Leydi Kaduna|script=Latn}}, {{lang|ff-Adlm|û§§û§´û§¥û§£û§≠ û§≥û§¢û§£û§µû§≤û§¢}}; {{langx|kcg|SiÃ±tet KaÃ±duna}}) is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in the northwest geopolitical zone of [[Nigeria]]. The state capital is its namesake, the city of [[Kaduna]], which was the [[List of Nigerian cities by population|8th largest city]] in the country as of 2006. Created in 1967 as '''North-Central State''', which also encompassed the modern [[Katsina State]], Kaduna State achieved its current borders in 1987. Kaduna State is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|fourth largest]] and [[List of Nigerian states by population|third most populous]] state in the country, Kaduna State is nicknamed the ''Centre of Learning'', owing to the presence of numerous educational [[Higher education|institutions]] of importance within the state such as [[Ahmadu Bello University]].<ref name=":1" />

Modern Kaduna State is home to the sites of some of Africa's oldest civilizations, including the [[Nok culture|Nok civilization]] that prospered from {{circa|[[1500s BC (decade)|1500 BC]]}} to {{circa|[[AD 500|500 AD]]}}.<ref name="PB 2014">Breunig, Peter. 2014.

The state economy is dependent on [[agriculture]], especially [[cotton]] and [[Peanut|groundnut]] production.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":3" /><ref name=":4" /> In the modern era, Kaduna State has been the site of violent [[Demographics of Nigeria|ethnic]] and [[Religion in Nigeria|religious]] conflict,<ref>{{cite web|date=5 February 2021|title=El-Rufai vows to restore Kaduna to its past glory|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/02/el-rufai-vows-to-restore-kaduna-to-its-past-glory/|access-date=12 March 2021|website=Vanguard News|language=en-US|archive-date=16 February 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210216224821/https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/02/el-rufai-vows-to-restore-kaduna-to-its-past-glory/|url-status=live}}</ref> with the 2002 [[Miss World riots]] in the state capital over purported [[blasphemy]] leading to around 250 deaths and the loss of homes for around 30,000.<ref name="HRWimpunity">{{cite web|date=23 July 2003|title=The "Miss World Riots": Continued Impunity for Killings in Kaduna|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2003/07/22/miss-world-riots/continued-impunity-killings-kaduna|access-date=7 April 2014|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|archive-date=8 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200508011956/https://www.hrw.org/report/2003/07/22/miss-world-riots/continued-impunity-killings-kaduna|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The most widespread etymology for the word ''Kaduna'' is that it is a corruption of the [[Hausa language|Hausa]] plural for crocodile, {{Lang|ha|kadduna|italic=yes}}, as there used to be many crocodiles in the [[Kaduna River]].<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-Nigeria|title=Kaduna {{!}} Location, History, & Facts|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en|access-date=28 July 2019|archive-date=19 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190419131059/https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaduna-Nigeria|url-status=live}}</ref> 

Another version of the etymology of the name is a narrative linked to the [[Gbagyi language|Gbagyi]] word/name 'Odna' for the Kaduna River.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Fundamentals of the Gbagyi Language|last=Shekwo|first=Joseph Amali|publisher=Centre for Adult Education and Extension Services, Ahmadu Bello University|year=1979|location=Zaria}}</ref>

==History==
[[Zazzau]], a [[List of Nigerian traditional states|traditional state]] which lies within the province's capital, is said to have been founded in 1536. It would later be renamed to Zaria after the younger sister of [[Amina (Queen of Zazzau)|Queen Amina]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Smith |first=Bonnie G. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFI7tr9XK6EC&q=Zauzau,+or+Zaria,+was+a+very+important+trade+center+and+one+of+a+series+of+Hausa+states+established+after+the+fall+of+the+Songhai+empire,+which+covered+most+of+northern+and+western+Africa+into+the+ninth+century.+Zaria+came+to+dominate+th |title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Women in World History |date=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780195148909 |language=en}}</ref> The [[Hausa people]] of [[Zaria]] are said to be the old ancestral of the region.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |title=Zaria {{!}} Nigeria |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Zaria-Nigeria |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161106065218/https://www.britannica.com/place/Zaria-Nigeria |archive-date=6 November 2016 |access-date=5 November 2016 |newspaper=Encyclop√¶dia Britannica}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=M.G |first=Smith |title=Government in Zazzau: A study of Government in the Hausa Chiefdom of the Zaria in Northern Nigeria from 1800-1950 |publisher=Oxford University Press for the International African Institute |year=1960 |isbn=978-0197242018}}</ref>{{Clarification needed|reason=Old ancestral what?

It is indicative that the name, Kaduna, was taken up by Lord [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Frederick Lugard]] and his colonial colleagues when they moved the capital of the then Northern Region from [[Zungeru]] to Kaduna City in 1916. This move of the colonial office to Kaduna city started in 1912‚Äì1918/20, with the initial effort having been made in 1902 from Jebba to Zungeru.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-05-29 |title=History Of Kaduna State |url=https://nigeriazipcodes.com/10556/history-of-kaduna-state/ |access-date=2023-05-15 |website=Nigeria Zip Codes |language=en-US}}</ref>

At the start of British colonial rule in northern Nigeria, the people groups who lived in the area became 'Northern Nigerians'- a construct which continues even today. By 1967 these people groups were again carved into 'North Central State'; this was the case until 1975 when 'Kaduna State' was formerly created by the then military leader, Gen. [[Murtala Mohammed]], with all distinct identities amalgamated into one state without a referendum. The state hence is the successor of the old [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] of Nigeria, which had its capital at Kaduna which is now the state capital of about 6.3&nbsp;million people (Nigerian census figure, 2006).

In 1967, the old [[Northern Region, Nigeria|Northern Region]] was divided into six states in the north, leaving Kaduna as the capital of North-Central State, whose name was changed to Kaduna State in 1976. Meanwhile, Kaduna State was further divided in 1987, creating [[Katsina State]]. Under the governance of Kaduna are the ancient cities of [[Zaria]], [[Kafanchan]], and [[Nok]]. The most intriguing aspect of this area is that the colonial construction and its post-colonial successor called 'Nigeria' hardly documented the history or the method of how Kaduna State's people groups encompassed in these constructs define and identify themselves. As such, the people groups who populate the area have lived in near oblivion or obscurity as they are often thought of as [[Hausa people]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2024}} In 2019 Kaduna State celebrated its 100th anniversary, making it one of the oldest states in Nigeria.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-42383714 |title=Kalli hotunan bikin cika shekara 100 da kafa Kaduna |work=BBC Hausa |date=17 December 2017 |language=ha |access-date=8 December 2021 |archive-date=9 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210309200407/https://www.bbc.com/hausa/labarai-42383714 |url-status=live }}</ref>
