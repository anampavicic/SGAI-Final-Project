==History==
The area of modern Asaka developed as a series of four [[shukuba|post stations]] on the Kawagoe Kaidō highway from the [[Muromachi period]] onwards. During the [[Edo Period]], the area was noted as a center for copper crafts. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], the village of Hizaori was created within Niikura District, Saitama with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Niikura District was abolished in 1894 and became part of [[Kitaadachi District, Saitama|Kitaadachi District]]. It was raised to town status on May 1, 1921, and renamed Asaka after [[Prince Yasuhiko Asaka]] who was an honorary chairman of the Tokyo Golf Club, which relocated to the area at that time. On April 1, 1955, Asaka annexed the neighboring village of Uchimagi.  At the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in neighboring Tokyo, the town hosted the riding part of the [[Modern pentathlon at the 1964 Summer Olympics|modern pentathlon]] event at Asaka Nezu Park. Asaka was elevated to city status on March 15, 1967. In 2005, a proposal to merge Asaka with Shiki, Wako, and Niiza to form a new city with a combined population sufficient to qualify for [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] status was defeated in a referendum, largely due to opposition from Wako.

==Government==
Asaka has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Asaka contributes two members to the Saitama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Saitama 4th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Due to its location, Asaka is primarily a [[bedroom community]] with over 37% of its population commuting to the Tokyo metropolis for work. The area is also a distribution hub for northern Tokyo.

==Education==
Asaka has ten public elementary schools and five public middle schools operated by the city government, and two public high schools operated by the Saitama Prefectural Board of Education. [[Toyo University]] also has a campus in Asaka.
