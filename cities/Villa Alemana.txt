'''Villa Alemana''' ({{IPA|es|ˈbiʝaleˈmana}}; "German Village" in English) is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] in Chile's [[Zona Central, Chile|Zona Central]]. It was founded in 1896 by Italian and German immigrants. Villa Alemana is a part of the urban area known as [[Greater Valparaiso]].

Villa Alemana's flag is notable for having the [[Flag of Germany#North German Confederation and the German Empire (1867–1918)|flag of the German Empire]] banded on it, along with the [[Flag of Germany]].

== History ==
[[File:Tren Villa Alemana 1880.jpg|thumb|Tren Villa Alemana 1880]]
Villa Alemana was founded at the beginning of a Chilean railway development. Its climate is so temperate that the slogan is "The City of Eternal Youth" ("La ciudad de la eterna juventud" in Spanish) or "City of the Mills" ("Ciudad de los Molinos" in Spanish).

There was originally nothing but fields as well as a small vineyard,  trees and flowers, dominated by hawthorn trees (''[[Crataegus]]''). Where the Theater Pompeya stands today, land was offered for 20 cents per meter. And that was where Don Buenaventura Joglar had the idea to buy land and build a population which he named Villa Alemana, as German emigrants were the first to buy these sites.{{cn|date=December 2021}}

On 8 November 1894, it was founded under the name of Viña Miraflores. The property was owned by Don Buenaventura Joglar, who divided the land into lots and set the name of Villa Alemana.{{cn|date=December 2021}}

On 5 January 1918, the commune of Villa Alemana was established, but in 1928 it was incorporated in [[Quilpué]]. On 7 June 1933, Villa Alemana separated from Quilpué, recreating the commune of Villa Alemana. Today, it is a [[bedroom community]] for [[Viña del Mar]] and [[Valparaíso]].{{cn|date=December 2021}}
