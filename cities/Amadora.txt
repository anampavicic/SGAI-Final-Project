'''Amadora''' ({{IPA|pt-PT|ɐmɐˈðoɾɐ|-|Pt-pt Amadora FF.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities in Portugal|city]] and [[concelho|municipality]] in the northwest of the [[Lisbon metropolitan area]] and 10&nbsp;km from central [[Lisbon]]. The population in 2011 was 175,136,<ref name=ine>[http://www.ine.pt/xportal/xmain?xlang=en&xpid=INE&xpgid=ine_indicadores&indOcorrCod=0005889&contexto=pi&selTab=tab0 Instituto Nacional de Estatística]</ref> in an area of 23.78&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (9.2 sq mi).<ref name=dgt>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dgterritorio.pt/cartografia_e_geodesia/cartografia/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal_caop_/caop__download_/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal___versao_2017__em_vigor_/ |title=Áreas das freguesias, concelhos, distritos e país |access-date=2018-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181105172426/http://www.dgterritorio.pt/cartografia_e_geodesia/cartografia/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal_caop_/caop__download_/carta_administrativa_oficial_de_portugal___versao_2017__em_vigor_/ |archive-date=2018-11-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is the fourth biggest, and most densely populated, city in Portugal.

==History==
There is significant evidence of [[Neolithic]] settlements in the municipality. The [[Necropolis of Carenque]] consists of three artificial caves that served as tombs from around 3000 BCE.

Amadora was originally named ''Porcalhota'',<ref>{{Cite book |last=Filho |first=José Paulo Cavalcanti |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ktXrDwAAQBAJ |title=Fernando Pessoa: A quasi memoir |date=2019-08-02 |publisher=Mimesis |isbn=978-88-6977-248-1 |language=en}}</ref> for being a [[Majorat]] of the daughter of a man surnamed ''Porcalho'' who was called for being a female ''Porcalhota''.

The [[Aqueduto das Águas Livres]], which brings water from the [[Sintra]] hills to [[Lisbon]], and stretches {{convert|30|km|mi}}, was finished in the 1770s and includes the largest masonry arch ever built, located in Campolide — the local coat of arms also displays the aqueduct (like others along its way).

At the request of its population, in 1907, a decree issued during King [[Carlos I of Portugal|Carlos I]] reign, merged the communities of Porcalhota, Amadora and Venteira into one town named Amadora.

At the present time Amadora does not have any airfield. However, in the 1920s a small airfield (the first in Portugal) was located here. The first flight from Portugal to Brazil left from Amadora. The Captain of the airplane was Adm. [[Gago Coutinho]], a well known Portuguese celebrity.

The municipality was formed on 11 September 1979, when it ceased being a parish of the municipality of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]]. A few days later, on 17 September, Amadora was granted city status.

The former [[Sorefame]] railway rolling stock factory was located in Amadora, but was closed in 2004. Most of the carriages for [[Comboios de Portugal|Portuguese Railways]] built during the second half of the 20th century were constructed here.

==Geography==
One of the largest urban communities in Portugal, Amadora forms a [[conurbation]] with [[Lisbon]], sharing the same subway, bus and train networks. It is dominated by large apartment blocks, commercial parks, industrial areas and some headquarters of international companies.

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 6 civil parishes (''[[freguesia (Portugal)|freguesias]]''):<ref>{{cite web|title=Law nr. 11-A/2013, page 552 13|url=http://dre.pt/pdf1sdip/2013/01/01901/0000200147.pdf |access-date=16 July 2014|author=Diário da República|author-link=Diário da República|language=pt}}</ref>

As commercial zones, it has [[IKEA]], Nokia, Decathlon, Alegro, Continente and ''Ubbo'' (one of the biggest shopping malls in Europe). [[Siemens]] and [[Hoffmann–La Roche|Roche]] are examples of international companies based in Amadora.

Amadora hosted Portugals national builder of railway rolling stock, [[Sorefame]], until its demise in 2004.

==Transport==
Amadora's public transport network is extremely far-reaching and reliable and is fully integrated with the transportation network of the [[Lisbon metropolitan area]]. It has 3 [[Lisbon Metro|metro]] stations, the commuter [[Sintra Line]] with 3 stations, 2 bus services (Carris Metropolitana and Carris) and 4 motorways around the city (2ª Circular, CRIL, CREL and IC-16).
