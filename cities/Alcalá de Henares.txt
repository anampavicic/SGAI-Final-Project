'''Alcalá de Henares''' ({{IPA|es|alkaˈla ðe eˈnaɾes|Spanish|Pronunciation_of_Alcalá_de_Henares_in_Spanish.ogg}}) is a Spanish city in the [[Community of Madrid]]. Straddling the [[Henares River]], it is located {{convert|31|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the northeast of the center of [[Madrid]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2016-03-04 |title=Datos un municipio |url=http://www.madrid.org/desvan/almudena/servlet/AccionDatosUnMunicipio.icm?municipio=0053&listaTemas=%27101004%27 |access-date=2023-01-31 |archive-date=2016-03-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113335/http://www.madrid.org/desvan/almudena/servlet/AccionDatosUnMunicipio.icm?municipio=0053&listaTemas=%27101004%27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> {{As of|2018}}, it has a population of 193,751, making it the region's third-most populated [[Municipalities in Spain|municipality]].

Predated by earlier settlements (''[[oppidum|oppida]]'') on the left bank of the Henares, the city has its origins in the [[Complutum]] settlement founded in Roman times on the right bank (north) of the river, that became a bishopric seat in the 5th century. One of the several Muslim citadels in the Middle Mark of [[al-Andalus]] (hence the name ''Alcalá'', a derivative of the Arabic term for citadel) was established on the left bank, while, after the Christian conquest culminated {{Circa|1118}}, the bulk of the urban nucleus returned to the right bank. For much of the late middle-ages and the early modern period before becoming part of the province of Madrid, Alcalá de Henares was a seigneurial estate of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toledo|archbishops of Toledo]].

Its historical centre is one of [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage Site]]s.

The city has a long university tradition. [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros]] founded the [[Complutense University of Madrid#History|Complutense University]] in Alcalá de Henares in the late 15th century. The city currently hosts the (refounded) [[University of Alcalá]]. It is the native city of [[Miguel de Cervantes]].

== Name ==
Locally, it is generally known simply as {{lang|es|Alcalá}}, but {{lang|es|de Henares}} (‘of the river [[Henares]]’) is appended when needed to differentiate it from a dozen Spanish cities sharing the name [[Alcalá (disambiguation)|Alcalá]] (from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word {{lang|ar|القلعة}} {{transl|ar|al-qalʿa}}, for fortification or [[citadel]], typically a castle).

==History==
{{Main|Complutum}}
[[File:ComplutumEstaciones.jpg|thumb|left|Roman mosaic of the four seasons, the House of Bacchus, Complutum]]

The city boundaries have been inhabited since the [[Chalcolithic]] phase of the [[Bronze Age]]. [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] conquered the area in the 1st century BC, and built the town of ''Complutum'' near a previous [[Carpetani]]an settlement, Iplacea. With 10,000 inhabitants, it reached the status of ''[[municipium]]'' and had its own governing institutions. It played an important role, located on the Roman road connecting [[Emerita Augusta]] and [[Caesaraugusta]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://www.madrid.org/bvirtual/BVCM002175.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.madrid.org/bvirtual/BVCM002175.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|page=12|year=2003|title=La ciudad romana de Complutum.

-->
After the downfall of the Roman Empire, under the [[Visigoths]], it declined, although it also became a pilgrimage destination in remembrance of the [[Justus and Pastor|Saints Justo and Pastor]].

When the [[Moorish invasion of Iberia|Moors invaded]] in 711, they conquered the Visigothic city and founded another site, building an {{transl|ar|al-qalʿa}}, which means "citadel" in Arabic, on a nearby hill, today known as {{lang|es|Alcalá la Vieja}} (Old Alcalá). On 3 May 1118, it was reconquered by the [[Archbishop of Toledo]] [[Bernard de Sedirac]] at behest of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]].

Soon after, on 10 February 1129,{{Sfn|García Valcárcel|Écija Moreno|Valcárcel|2001|p=167}} [[Alfonso VII of León and Castile|Alfonso VII]] gave Alcalá to [[Raymond de Sauvetât]], also Archbishop of Toledo, becoming an archiepiscopal property for centuries to come.{{Sfn|Castillo Oreja|2006|p=34}} Raymond granted the town an old ''[[fuero]]'' (charter) in 1135.{{Sfn|Pérez-Bustamante|1986|p=747}}

The Christians preferred the ''Burgo de Santiuste'' ("Saint Just's borough") on the original Roman site, and the Muslim one was abandoned.

Under [[Christians|Christian]] rule until the end of the Reconquista, the town had both a Jewish and a Moorish quarter and a renowned marketplace. Its central position allowed it to be a frequent residence of the [[Kings of Castile]], when travelling south.

At some time in the 1480s, [[Christopher Columbus]] first met there the ''[[Reyes Católicos]]'', [[King Ferdinand II of Aragon]] and his wife [[Queen Isabella I of Castile]], who financed the travel for the ''[[Voyages of Christopher Columbus|Discovery of America]]''.

[[Cardinal Cisneros]] granted the town a new ''fuero'' in 1509.{{Sfn|Pérez-Bustamante|1986|p=745}}
[[File:Anthonis van den Wijngaerde (1565) Alcalá de Henares.png|thumb|center|upright=3.5|View of the town by [[Anton van den Wyngaerde]] (1565)]]

Despite being largely ruined, the town acquired the status of city in 1687 after long negotiations.{{Sfn|Gómez López|1992|p=180}}
[[File:Hauser y Menet (ca. 1910) Alcalá de Henares, calle Mayor y Hospital de Antezana.png|thumb|right|Calle Mayor, {{circa|1910}}]]
In decadence since the mid-18th century, Alcalá de Henares experienced a relative demographic and economic upturn in the second half of the 19th century, based on its newly acquired condition of military outpost, to which an embryonic industrial nucleus was also added.{{Sfn|Gómez Mendoza|2008|pp=625–628}}

The population steadily increased from 1868 to 1939.{{Sfn|Vadillo Muñoz|2017|pp=279–284}} The population was still agrarian to a large extent, with high levels of illiteracy and poverty.{{Sfn|Vadillo Muñoz|2017|pp=279–284}} Seeking social change, [[Republicanism in Spain|Republican]] and later Socialist movements grew in force in the city.{{Sfn|Vadillo Muñoz|2017|pp=279–284}} The leading figure in the latter movement was {{ill|Antonio Fernández Quer|es}}, who became the first municipal councillor from the [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] in the province of Madrid in 1903.{{Sfn|Vadillo Muñoz|2017|pp=279–284}} Emerging in reaction to Socialist advances, [[Catholic social teaching|Social catholicism]] also took hold in the city from 1905, founding a number of organizations such as ''Centro Católico de Acción Social Popular'' and the ''Mutual Obrera Complutense''.{{Sfn|Vadillo Muñoz|2017|pp=279–284}}

Following the [[Spanish coup of July 1936|1936 coup d'etat]] that sparked the [[Spanish Civil War]], putschist elements seized key posts around the city.{{Sfn|Sánchez Moltó|2014|p=120}} However, following the botched coup in Madrid, Rebel forces in Alcalá eventually surrendered to Republican Colonel [[Ildefonso Puigdendolas]] and his troops on 21 July.{{Sfn|Sánchez Moltó|2014|p=120}} Alcalá, that reportedly became a Soviet power base during the conflict—a "republic within the republic" where the Republican national government held a tenuous grip—was the place were [[POUM]] leader [[Andrés Nin]] was transferred to and tortured and killed in June 1937 by [[NKVD]] agents.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/113489/1/577389.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://diposit.ub.edu/dspace/bitstream/2445/113489/1/577389.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|title=El asesinato de Andreu Nin, más datos para la polémica|year=2010|first=Pelai|last=Pagès i Blanch|journal=Ebre|issue=38|issn=1696-2672}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lne.es/sociedad-cultura/2008/03/18/cadaver-andreu-nin-acusa/618446.html|website=La Nueva España|title=El cadáver de Andreu Nin acusa|date=18 March 2008|access-date=25 July 2020|archive-date=25 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200725160903/https://www.lne.es/sociedad-cultura/2008/03/18/cadaver-andreu-nin-acusa/618446.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Ecclesiastical history===
<!--
[[File:Alcalá de Henares Palacio Arzobispal 6045.JPG|thumb|Tower of Tenorio of the [[Archbishop's Palace of Alcalá de Henares|Archbishop's Palace of Alcalá]].]]-->
The town of historic importance was one of the first [[Diocese|bishoprics]] founded in Spain.

The polyglot Bible known as the [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible]], the first of the many similar Bibles produced during the revival of Biblical studies that took place in the 16th century, was printed at Alcalá under the care of [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Cardinal Cisneros]].

A [[papal bull]] of 7 March 1885, united Alcalá with (effectively merging it into) the [[diocese of Madrid]], which includes the civil province of Madrid, [[suffragan]] of the [[archbishopric of Toledo]]. The bishop's residence has since been used for preserving historical archives. It was designed by [[Alonso Berruguete]] and has a famous staircase.

===Jewish history===
During [[Muslim]] rule, the [[Jewish]] community of the city was granted equal rights as the [[Christians]] living in it: special restrictions were not placed on Jews regarding criminal compensation, residency, and other municipal aspects. In the [[Middle Ages]], the Jewish congregation of the city paid taxes to the [[Archbishop of Toledo]].<ref name=autogenerated1>{{Cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0001_0_00697.html |title=Alcalá de Henares<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=2015-11-14 |archive-date=2015-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117022017/https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0001_0_00697.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Jews]] of Alcalá were mentioned in the 14th-century Satire by [[Marrano]] [[Pero Ferrús]]. During the 15th century, the Jewish congregation of the city was one of the largest in [[Crown of Castile|Castile]], having about 200 Jewish families. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] studies at the [[University of Alcalá]] were encouraged by Cardinal [[Francisco Jimenez de Cisneros]] during the 16th century, bringing some Jews and [[Marrano]] Hebraists to work in the city.<ref name=autogenerated1 /> The location of the [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]] of the city is well known &ndash; between Mayor, Santiago, Imagen and Cervantes streets. One [[synagogue]] stood in Carmen Calzado street, no. 10. The other was on Santiago street. After the 1492 [[Alhambra Decree]] Jews were required to become Christians to continue living in Castile and Aragon; those who refused had to leave these kingdoms and most of them found residence in the North of Africa, Amsterdam and the Ottoman Empire.

The origins of Miguel de Cervantes' family are supposed (there is no total certainty) to be Jewish. Because his father worked on the former Jewish neighbourhood, the birthplace was close to the workplace, and also because the surname Cervantes makes reference to a different site in the Northwest of Spain, and geographical surnames were common among the Jewish population.

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
[[File:Alcalá de Henares (ESA 16-11-2015) vista desde el satélite Sentinel-2A.png|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Alcalá de Henares as seen by the [[Sentinel-2]] of the [[European Space Agency]]]]
Alcalá de Henares is located in the central part of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in the southern half of the [[Meseta Central|Inner Plateau]]. It lies on the valley of the [[Henares]], a left-bank tributary of the [[Jarama]], which is in turn a right-bank tributary of the [[Tagus]]. The right (north) bank of the river (on which the current urban nucleus was built) displays a very flat relief with a series of quaternary [[fluvial terrace]]s, while the left (southern) bank features a very steep slope of [[clay]]s from the [[miocene]],{{Sfn|Aranegui|Pacheco|1927|p=342}} rapidly rising up to the [[Moorland|moors]] of [[La Alcarria]].

Standing at an average altitude of 654 m, and occupying some 88&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>; the city was for a long time contained in between the Henares to the South and the [[Madrid-Barcelona railway]] to the North. However, the increasing population brought on the sprawl of the urbanised area to the area located in between the railway and the [[Autovía A-2|A-2 motorway]] and beyond.

===Climate===
The climate in this city of central Spain is [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]], with cold, dry winters and hot, dry summers. The average year-round temperature is {{convert|14|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The average year-round rainfall is about {{convert|300|mm|1|abbr=on}}, mainly in spring and autumn. Temperatures vary from some degrees below {{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}} in December and January to some over {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July and August. Dry season coincides with maximum heat in summer.

==University==
{{Main|University of Alcalá}}
[[File:Universidad de Alcala.jpg|thumb|The ''rectorado'' of the [[University of Alcalá]]]]
The major landmark and one of the great prides of the city, its university, uses sites throughout the city, but has two main campuses. The first is on the north side of Alcalá. This campus includes most science departments and student housing (as well as its own, separate [[Renfe]] [[Alcalá de Henares Universidad railway station|station]]). The second, central campus, houses most of the humanities and social-science departments, including a law school.

The architectural influence of the university can be found in other present-day academic institutions. The [[University of San Diego]] is largely based on the Spanish university; its campus and address take the name "Alcalá Park".  In addition, some buildings at [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]] were modeled after the architecture of Universidad de Alcalá de Henares.<ref>

[[File:University and Historic Precinct of Alcalá de Henares-112993.jpg|thumb|left|Cloister part of the university]]
In 1293 in Alcalá de Henares King [[Sancho IV of Castile]] founded the ''[[Complutense University of Madrid|Universidad Complutense]]'', one of the oldest universities in the world, as a [[Studium Generale]]. With the patronage of [[Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros|Cardinal Cisneros]], it was recognized in a 1499 [[papal bull]], and quickly gained international fame as a main centre of learning of the [[Renaissance]] thanks to the production of the [[Complutensian Polyglot Bible]] in 1517, which is the basis for most{{quantify|date=June 2019}} of the current translations. By royal decree, the university moved to Madrid in 1836 (initially as the Universidad de Madrid, later as the Universidad Central, which in the 1970s would finally be renamed ''[[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]]''). A new university was founded in the old buildings as the ''[[Universidad de Alcalá]]'' in 1977. Parts of the new university occupy the buildings of the old Universidad Complutense in the city centre, including the modern Colegio de San Ildefonso, the [[College of Málaga|Colegio de Málaga]] and other ''Colegios'', and the structures have served as a model for other universities across the Spanish territories in the Americas and other dependencies.

[[File:Palacio Laredo (30-06-2007) balcón y minarete.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Laredo Palace]]]]
The university chapel dedicated to Saint Ildefonso has a monument to the university's founder, Cardinal Cisneros, by [[Fancelli]], an Italian sculptor.

Although the present university is named "Universidad de Alcalá", the ancient institution founded by Cisneros is the one now called "Universidad Complutense", translocated in the capital city of Madrid ("Complutensis" is the Latin word for "native of Alcalá"). The modern university is related to the original institution in name only, although it occupies the former buildings of the Complutense.

==Cathedral==
{{Main|Alcalá de Henares Cathedral}}
[[File:Alcala cathedral 2023 - western façade.jpg|thumb|[[Cathedral of the Santos Niños]].]]
Aside from the buildings associated with the university, one of the city's most important and historic building is the Cathedral-Magistral of Saints [[Justus and Pastor]], known formally in Spanish as the {{lang|es|Santa e Insigne Catedral-Magistral de los Santos Justo y Pastor}} or more familiarly as the {{lang|es|Catedral de los Santos Niños}}. Constructed between 1497 and 1514, the cathedral houses the remains of Saints Justus and Pastor, two Christian schoolboys martyred near the city during the persecutions of the Roman Emperor [[Diocletian]] at the beginning of the 4th century.

[[File:Alcala cathedral 2023 - western portico.jpg|thumb|left|The western [[façade]] of the [[Cathedral of the Santos Niños]], in a "florid" or "[[Isabelline Gothic]]" style]]
In 414 a chapel was erected at the site of Justus and Pastor's martyrdom, and was converted into a [[cathedral]] during the period of [[Visigoths|Visigoth]] control of [[Hispania]]; bishops from Alcalá were present at the [[Councils of Toledo]] beginning in the 7th century. In 1053 the old city of Alcalá (''Alcalá la Vieja'') was conquered by  [[Ferdinand I of León|Ferdinand the Great]], only to be recaptured the following year by the Moorish armies then warring for control of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], who destroyed the cathedral as an act of retaliation. At that time the relics of Saints Justus and Pastor were taken to [[Huesca]] for safekeeping until after the reconquest of Alcalá in 1118. Although a church was rebuilt on the site in 1122, Pope [[Urban II]], under the influence of his friend [[Raymond de Sauvetât]], the [[Archbishop of Toledo]], decided not to restore the Diocese of Alcalá at that time. Instead, de Sauvetât was able to secure the incorporation of Alcalá into his own archiepiscopal territories through a donation from King  [[Alfonso VII of León|Alfonso VII]] in 1129.

The church was rebuilt again some three hundred years later by a subsequent archbishop of Toledo, Alfonso Carrillo de Acuña, who elevated it to the status of a [[collegiate church]]. It was finally reconstructed in its present Isabelline Gothic style under Cardinal Cisneros (1495–1517), the founder of the university. A tower was added between 1528 and 1582, achieving its modern appearance in 1618. The processional [[cloister]] and the Chapel of Saint Peter were incorporated into the building in the 17th century.

The building was declared a national monument in 1904. Nevertheless, it was burned during the [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939), and practically all of its contents were destroyed with the exception of a few minor relics and choir seats.

[[File:Capilla del Oidor.jpg|thumb|Oidor Church]]
It was not until 1991 that the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Alcalá de Henares|Diocese of Alcalá]] was finally restored, being separated from the Archdiocese of Madrid, at which time the building was granted its present status of cathedral-magistral (although the title "magistral" was originally granted by Cardinal Cisneros, the building was still technically only a [[collegiate church]], and not yet a cathedral within the ecclesiastical meaning of the term).

The Cathedral of Alcalá is notable as one of only two churches in the world to be granted the special title "magistral" (along with [[St. Peter's Church, Leuven|St. Peter's Church]] in [[Leuven]], [[Belgium]]). The title reflects its former status as a [[collegiate church]], and derives from the requirement that all of the [[Canon (priest)|canons]] of the cathedral must possess the academic distinction of [[Doctor of Theology]] in order to serve there.

In addition to that of Saints Justus and Pastor, the cathedral also houses the tomb of renowned 17th-century Spanish sculptor [[Gregorio Fernández]].

==Other buildings==
The city is also home to the Archbishops Palace. This site is where Christopher Columbus and King Ferdinand planned the excursion to the West as well as the birthplace of [[Catherine of Aragon]], daughter of Ferdinand and Isabella, who would be the first wife of King [[Henry VIII of England]] and therefore queen consort of [[England]].

Alcalá's [[Corral de comedias de Alcalá de Henares|Corral of Comedies]], which hosts a full program of theatre and is open for tours, is the oldest documented corral in the history of Spain.

==The city today==
The center of the city remains essentially medieval, with many winding cobbled streets, and many historic buildings. The city centre surrounds the ''Plaza de Cervantes'' and is traversed by a long pedestrian main street, the ''Calle Mayor''. The city includes the Moorish quarter, the Jewish quarter, and the Christian quarter. These distinct neighborhoods have given Alcalá the reputation of "the city of three cultures".

The old city centre has been largely preserved, unlike the suburbs. There has been no clear planning by the city councillors regarding expansion, and the sprawling suburban areas are irregularly constructed, with the addition of 1970s-style high rise blocks in many places.

One of the most important streets in the city is the ''Calle del Cardenal Cisneros'' which takes tourists from the Madrid Gate at the entrance of the city, to the old city center and the cathedral in Santos Niños Square. The main park of Alcalá, Parque Municipal O'Donnell is a major recreational center for city residents and lies along a main road of Alcalá, Vía Complutense.

Recent archaeological excavations have opened up the city's Roman forum where a large complex comprising a basilica, public baths, a [[cryptoporticus]], a market and a large monumental façade stands out. Alongside the forum is the Domus with an extraordinary collection of Roman domestic mural paintings. On the outskirts is the House of Hippolytus, an old school. In turn, the [[Regional Archaeological Museum of the Community of Madrid|Regional Archaeology Museum]] (MAR) holds highly valuable mosaics.

The city hosts a large population of international students due to the presence of the university, and in particular its [[Spanish language]] and literature programs for foreign students. Alcalingua, a branch of [[University of Alcalá]], is one of the major foreign language learning centers for students from abroad.

===The storks===
Alcalá is well known for its population of [[white stork]]s. Their large nests can be observed atop many of the churches and historic buildings in the city, and are themselves a significant tourist attraction. Situated in the lowlands of the [[Henares|Henares river]], the city is an attractive home for the migratory storks due to the wide availability of food and nesting material in the area.

For over twenty years, Alcalá's storks have been counted and studied, and the active protection and maintenance of their nests is by official policy. Although once in danger of disappearing, with only eleven pairs counted between 1986 and 1987, the population has grown to around 90 resident pairs today, many of which have shortened the distance and duration of their typical migrations to remain in the city nearly all year.<ref>[http://www.ayto-alcaladehenares.es/template2.asp?cat_id=2483&mcat_id=1107&site_language=2&opt=m01_010&mcat=3909 "''Las cigüeñas de Alcalá'' at The City of Alcalá's official web site (in Spanish)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081208002217/http://www.ayto-alcaladehenares.es/template2.asp?cat_id=2483&mcat_id=1107&site_language=2&opt=m01_010&mcat=3909 |date=2008-12-08 }}</ref>

Some 18% of the population are of foreign origin, according to the official data, a large part of the newcomers (30%) are immigrants from [[Eastern Europe]]. Many [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] businesses have also been established in the city. Alcalá has the largest community (18%) of [[Romanians in Spain|Romanian immigrants in Spain]], with over 35,000 people. In 2007, for the first time, the immigrants from Romania created a political party for the elections to come.

==Transport==
