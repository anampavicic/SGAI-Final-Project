==History==
===Early history===
The area of present-day Toyama city was part of ancient [[Etchū Province]]. 
The Toyama Plain is good farmland and historically it was a point of strategic and traffic importance since prehistoric times.

====Feudal period====
During the [[Sengoku period]], it was frequently a battlefield, coming under the control of warlord [[Sassa Narimasa]], who built a [[castle town]] around [[Toyama Castle]] and channeled rivers to bringing about a flourishing agricultural industry.

====Early modern ages====
;Edo period
The area subsequently became part of [[Kaga Domain]] under the [[Maeda clan]] during the [[Edo period]], during which time a positive industrial promotion policy was implemented on the production of [[Chinese medicine]] and ''[[washi]]'' (Japanese paper).
Also, thanks to the improvement of ''[[kitamaebune]]'' sea transportation routes, these industries thrived and Toyama became known nationwide as the province of medicine.

===Recent history===
====Late modern ages====
;Meiji period
After the [[Meiji Restoration]], with the creation of the municipalities system, the city of Toyama was established on April 1, 1889, as one of the first 30 cities in Japan. Economically, the area developed heavy and chemical industries based on abundant hydroelectric electricity. 
Toyama has become one of the most influential cities on the [[Sea of Japan]] with its good water supply, drainage system and thriving agricultural, forestry, fishery, commercial and manufacturing industries.

====Contemporary ages====
During [[World War II]], [[Prisoner of war#Empire of Japan|Allied Prisoners of War (POWs)]] were sent to Toyama as forced labor.<ref>{{cite news |last=Pennington |first=Matthew |agency=Associated Press |title='The truth needs to be told' about Japan's war history, some vets say |url=http://www.stripes.com/news/pacific/japan/the-truth-needs-to-be-told-about-japan-s-war-history-some-vets-say-1.342262 |newspaper=Stars and Stripes |location=United States |date=25 April 2015 |access-date=25 April 2015 }}</ref> The city was almost completely destroyed on the night of August 1–2, 1945.  At the time of the bombing, the city was a center for aluminum, [[ball bearing|ball-bearing]] and special steel production. Left unscathed however, were the war-related factories just outside the city.<ref>[http://home.att.net/~sallyann6/b29/56years-4508a.html Info on att.net] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070228232357/http://home.att.net/~sallyann6/b29/56years-4508a.html |date=2007-02-28 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.echigonagaoka.com/bomb/n15.html|title=Nagaoka Air Raid &#124; Comparison to Other Cities|website=www.echigonagaoka.com}}</ref> The city during the time had a population of around 150,000 residents.  The city also held [[Kakure Kirishitan]], or "Hidden Christians" in Japan, forced from Nagasaki into internment camps after the government tried to punish them for their Christian beliefs.

=====2005 mergers=====
On April 1, 2005, the towns of [[Ōsawano, Toyama|Ōsawano]] and [[Ōyama, Toyama|Ōyama]] (both from [[Kaminiikawa District, Toyama|Kaminiikawa District]]), the towns of [[Fuchu, Toyama|Fuchū]] and [[Yatsuo, Toyama|Yatsuo]], and the villages of [[Hosoiri, Toyama|Hosoiri]] and [[Yamada, Toyama|Yamada]] (all from [[Nei District, Toyama|Nei District]]) were merged into Toyama. Kaminiikawa District and Nei District were both dissolved as a result of this merger.

==Government==
[[File:Toyama City Hall03nt3200.jpg|right|200px|thumb| Toyama city hall]]
Toyama has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 38 members.
