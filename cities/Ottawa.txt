===European exploration and early development===

In 1610, [[Étienne Brûlé]] became the first documented European to navigate the [[Ottawa River]], passing what would become Ottawa on his way to the [[Great Lakes]].{{sfn|Woods|1980|p=5}} Three years later, [[Samuel de Champlain]] wrote about the waterfalls in the area and about his encounters with the Algonquin people.{{sfn|Woods|1980|p=7}}

The first non-Indigenous settlement in the area was created by [[Philemon Wright]], a [[New England]]er. Wright founded a lumber town in the area on 7 March 1800 on the north side of the river, across from the present-day city of Ottawa in [[Hull, Quebec|Hull]].{{sfn|Van de Wetering|1997|p=123}}{{sfn|Lee|2006|p=16}} He, with five other families and twenty-five [[Laborer|labourers]], also created an agricultural community, which was named [[Wright's Town, Lower Canada|Wright's Town]].{{sfn|Taylor|1986|p=11}}{{sfn|Lee|2006|p=20}} Wright pioneered the [[Ottawa River timber trade|Ottawa Valley timber trade]] (soon to be the area's most significant economic activity) by transporting timber by river from the Ottawa Valley to [[Quebec City]].{{sfn|Van de Wetering|1997|p=11}}

In 1826, news of the British military's impending construction of the Rideau Canal led to land speculators founding a community on the south side of the Ottawa River.{{sfn|Woods|1980|p=60}} The following year, the town was named after British military engineer Colonel [[John By]] who was responsible for the entire Rideau Waterway construction project.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bytown |url=https://www.historicalsocietyottawa.ca/about-hso/our-history/tag/Bytown |access-date=10 July 2022 |website=The Historical Society of Ottawa |language=en-gb |archive-date=14 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220714034225/https://www.historicalsocietyottawa.ca/about-hso/our-history/tag/Bytown |url-status=live}}</ref> The Rideau canal provided a secure route between [[Montreal]] and [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] on Lake Ontario. It bypassed a vulnerable stretch of the St. Lawrence River bordering the state of New York that had left re-supply ships bound for southwestern Ontario easily exposed to enemy fire during the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Legget|1986|pp=22–24}}

[[File:First camp by By.jpg|thumb|right|Camp used by soldiers and labourers of the [[Rideau Canal]], on the south side of the [[Ottawa River]] in 1826. The building of the canal attracted many land speculators to the area.]]

Colonel By set up military barracks on the site of today's [[Parliament Hill]]. He also laid out the streets of the town and created two distinct neighbourhoods named "Upper Town" west of the canal and "[[Lower Town]]" east of the canal. Similar to its [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]] namesakes, historically, "Upper Town" was predominantly English-speaking and Protestant, whereas "Lower Town" was mostly French, Irish and Catholic.{{sfn|Taylor|1986|page 31}}

=== Selection as capital ===
The selection of Ottawa as the capital of Canada predates the Confederation of Canada. The choice was contentious and not straightforward, with the parliament of the [[Province of Canada|United Province of Canada]] holding more than 200 votes over several decades to attempt to settle on a legislative solution to the location of the capital.<ref name=":6" />

The governor-general of the province had designated [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] as the capital in 1841. However, the major population centres of [[Toronto]] and [[Montreal]], as well as the former capital of Lower Canada, [[Quebec City]], all had legislators dissatisfied with Kingston. Anglophone merchants in Quebec were the leading group supportive of the Kingston arrangement.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Knight |first=David B |title=Choosing Canada's capital: conflict resolution in a parliamentary system |publisher=Carleton university Press |year=1991 |pages=47–50}}</ref> In 1842, a vote rejected Kingston as the capital,<ref>Gordon, D.L.A., & Osborne, B.

''Choosing Canada's capital: conflict resolution in a parliamentary system''.

''Choosing Canada's capital: conflict resolution in a parliamentary system''. Carleton university Press. pp.&nbsp;88.</ref>

In 1849, after [[Burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal|violence in Montreal]], a series of votes was held, with Kingston and Bytown again considered potential capitals. However, the successful proposal was for two cities to share capital status and the legislature to alternate sitting in each: Quebec City and Toronto, in a policy known as perambulation.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 November 2017 |title=Toronto's Bid to Be the Capital of Canada |url=https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/online-exhibits/web-exhibits/web-exhibits-significant-events/the-earliest-known-photographs-of-toronto/torontos-bid-to-be-the-capital-of-canada/ |access-date=10 August 2022 |website=City of Toronto |language=en-CA |archive-date=4 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220804190343/https://www.toronto.ca/explore-enjoy/history-art-culture/online-exhibits/web-exhibits/web-exhibits-significant-events/the-earliest-known-photographs-of-toronto/torontos-bid-to-be-the-capital-of-canada/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Knight, David B (1991).

''Choosing Canada's capital: conflict resolution in a parliamentary system''. Carleton university Press. pp. 156-164</ref>

The funding impasse led to the ending of the legislature's role in determining the seat of government. The legislature requested the Queen determine the seat of government. The Queen then acted on the advice of her governor general [[Edmund Walker Head|Edmund Head]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Head, Sir Edmund National Historic Person |url=https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=1254 |access-date=14 July 2022 |website=www.pc.gc.ca |language=en |archive-date=14 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220714034214/https://www.pc.gc.ca/apps/dfhd/page_nhs_eng.aspx?id=1254 |url-status=live}}</ref> who, after reviewing proposals from various cities, selected the recently renamed Ottawa. The Queen sent a letter to colonial authorities selecting Ottawa as the capital, effective 31 December 1857. [[George Brown (Canadian politician)|George Brown]], briefly a co-premier of the Province of Canada, attempted to reverse this decision but was unsuccessful.

Other minor considerations included that despite Ottawa's regional isolation, there was water transportation access from spring to fall, both to Montreal via the Ottawa River, and to Kingston via the [[Rideau Waterway]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rideau Canal |url=https://www.historicalsocietyottawa.ca/publications/ottawa-stories/important-public-and-private-buildings-in-the-city/tag/Rideau%20Canal |access-date=14 July 2022 |publisher=The Historical Society of Ottawa |language=en-gb |archive-date=14 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220714034214/https://www.historicalsocietyottawa.ca/publications/ottawa-stories/important-public-and-private-buildings-in-the-city/tag/Rideau%20Canal |url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, by 1854 it also had a modern all-season railway (the [[Bytown and Prescott Railway]]) that carried passengers, lumber and supplies the 82 kilometres (50 miles) to [[Prescott, Ontario|Prescott]] on the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and beyond.{{Sfn|Taylor|1986|p=11}}<ref name="McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP" /> Ottawa's small size was also thought to be less prone to politically motivated mob violence, as had happened in the [[burning of the Parliament Buildings in Montreal|previous Canadian capitals]].<ref name="Bourrie1996">{{cite book |author=Mark Bourrie |title=Canada's Parliament Buildings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xUInFSPPc5kC&pg=PA19 |year=1996 |publisher=Dundurn Press Ltd. |isbn=978-0-88882-190-4 |page=19 |access-date=15 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160522101226/https://books.google.com/books?id=xUInFSPPc5kC&pg=PA19 |archive-date=22 May 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Finally, the government already owned the land that eventually became [[Parliament Hill]], which it thought would be an ideal location for the Parliament buildings.<ref name=":12" />

Ottawa is situated in a lowland on top of [[Paleozoic]] carbonate and shale and is surrounded by more craggy [[Precambrian]] igneous and metamorphic formations. Ottawa has had fluvial [[Deposition (geology)|deposition]] of [[till]] and sands, leading to the widespread formation of [[esker]]s. There are limited distinct features arising from glacial deposits, but Ottawa was affected by the [[Wisconsin glaciation|Late Wisconsian advance]]. Before the draining of the Champlain Sea, the area had high salinity. After the draining of the sea, the area had pine-dominated forests.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Government of Canada |first=Natural Resources Canada |date=7 December 2015 |title=GEOSCAN Search Results: Fastlink |url=https://geoscan.nrcan.gc.ca/starweb/geoscan/servlet.starweb?path=geoscan/fulle.web&search1=R=122374#:~:text=The%20Ottawa%20region%20is%20a,Precambrian%20igneous%20and%20metamorphic%20rocks. |access-date=13 August 2022 |website=geoscan.nrcan.gc.ca |archive-date=23 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220923212910/https://geoscan.nrcan.gc.ca/starweb/geoscan/servlet.starweb?path=geoscan/fulle.web&search1=R=122374#:~:text=The%20Ottawa%20region%20is%20a,Precambrian%20igneous%20and%20metamorphic%20rocks. |url-status=live}}</ref> Ottawa is located within the [[Western Quebec Seismic Zone]], and while relatively inactive, the city does occasionally experience earthquakes.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Government of Canada |first=Natural Resources Canada |title=Earthquake zones in Eastern Canada |url=https://earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/zones/eastcan-en.php#WQSZ |access-date=13 August 2022 |website=earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca |language=en |archive-date=1 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220901035350/http://www.earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/zones/eastcan-en.php#WQSZ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Earthquake2000">{{cite web |title=Earthquakes (Ottawa) |url=http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/products-services/mapping-product/geoscape/ottawa/6174 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408102203/http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/earth-sciences/products-services/mapping-product/geoscape/ottawa/6174 |archive-date=8 April 2013 |access-date=4 April 2013 |publisher=Natural Resources Canada}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=24 February 2006 |title=Earthquake shakes Ottawa |newspaper=[[Ottawa Citizen]] |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=24de3df5-eb4b-41de-8a31-9eb3ea0ed480&k=77474 |url-status=dead |access-date=17 April 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120213171831/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=24de3df5-eb4b-41de-8a31-9eb3ea0ed480&k=77474 |archive-date=13 February 2012}}</ref><ref name="Earthquake2010">{{cite web |date=23 June 2010 |title=Magnitude 5.5 – Ontario-Quebec Border Region, Canada |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010xwa7.php |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626024653/http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/recenteqsww/Quakes/us2010xwa7.php |archive-date=26 June 2010 |access-date=23 June 2010 |publisher=USGS}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=17 May 2013 |title=Earthquake shakes Ottawa |publisher=[[CTV Television Network|CTV]] |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/earthquake-rattles-residents-in-ontario-quebec-1.1285923 |url-status=live |access-date=17 May 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130518200929/http://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/earthquake-rattles-residents-in-ontario-quebec-1.1285923 |archive-date=18 May 2013}}</ref>
