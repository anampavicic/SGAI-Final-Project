==Etymology==
Kasur derives its name from the [[Arabic]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] word ''qasur'' ({{lang|ar|قصور}}),<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Singh|first1=Maya|url=https://archive.org/details/pnjbdictionary00clargoog|title=The Panjábí Dictionary|last2=Clark|first2=Henry Martyn|date=1895|publisher=Munshi Gulab Singh & sons|language=en|quote=Kasur.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Chopra|first=Gulshan Lall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZifwYm8MT0C&q=Kasar|title=Chiefs and Families of Note in the Punjab|date=1940|publisher=Government Printing|language=en}}</ref> meaning "palaces," or "forts."

==History==
[[File:Mazar Shah Kamal Chisti - Kasur.JPG|thumb|The hilltop shrine of ''Shah Kamal Chisti'' is a popular shrine in Kasur.]]

===Early===
The Kasur region was an agricultural region with forests during the [[Indus Valley civilization]]. The Kasur region was ruled variously by the [[Maurya Empire]], [[Indo-Greek kingdom]], [[Kushan Empire]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Hephthalite Empire|White Huns]], [[Kushano-Hephthalites]] and [[Kabul Shahi (disambiguation)|Kabul Shahi]] kingdoms. The region is also said to have been visited by the Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]] in 633 AD. [[Alexander Cunningham]] writes about his visit describing the place filled with [[Mazar (mausoleum)|tombs]], [[mosque]]s, and thickly covered with ruins. The city which is most commonly associated with Kasur was described as being situated somewhere on the right bank of the [[Beas River|Beas]] ([[Sutlej]]) opposite to the city of [[Lahore]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cunningham|first=Sir Alexander|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yH9Xef_vm1EC&pg=PA199|title=The Ancient Geography of India: I. The Buddhist Period, Including the Campaigns of Alexander, and the Travels of Hwen-Thsang|date=1871|publisher=Trübner and Company|language=en}}</ref>

=== Arrival of Islam ===

==== Ghaznavids ====
In 1005 CE, [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud of Ghazni]], took over the region under the [[Ghaznavids|Ghaznavid dynasty]]. This led to the introduction of [[Islam]] in the Northern [[Punjab]] area, after being conquered.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} [[Sufism|Sufi]] missionaries were sent to the region in order to preach Islam which made the [[Punjab|Punjab region]] predominantly [[Muslims|Muslim]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=History {{!}} DPO Kasur|url=https://dpokasur.punjabpolice.gov.pk/history|access-date=6 May 2021|website=dpokasur.punjabpolice.gov.pk}}</ref> The city was later under the rule of the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]].

==== Kheshgi Dynasty ====
Kasur was established as a city by the [[Kheshgi]] tribe of [[Pashtuns]] from [[Kabul]] who had migrated to the region in 1525 from [[Afghanistan]]<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EZifwYm8MT0C&q=kasur+arabic+punjab|title=Chiefs and Families of Note in the Punjab|last=Chopra|first=Gulshan Lall|date=1940|publisher=Government Printing|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Garg|first1=Sanjay|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JM5wDwAAQBAJ&q=Kasur+kheshgi&pg=PA500|title=Studies in Indo-Muslim History by S.H.

Some of these forts have been severely damaged over time.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kasur City Profile {{!}} PDF {{!}} Water Resources {{!}} Sewage|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/260258415/Kasur-City-Profile|access-date=13 January 2022|website=Scribd|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=22 July 2014|title=Kasur, Punjab, Pakistan|url=http://www.travelmypakistan.com/kasur/|access-date=13 January 2022|website=Travel My Pakistan|language=en-US}}</ref>

Under Mughal rule, the city flourished and was notable for commerce and trade. It became the home of the legendary Sufi saint and celebrated poet, [[Bulleh Shah]], who is buried in a large shrine in the city. After the decline of the [[Mughal Empire]], the Kasur region fell into a power vacuum. Kasur was captured by [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]] of the [[Durrani Empire]].

===Sikh===

===Modern===
[[File:Refugee at Balloki, Kasur during partition of India.jpg|thumb|Refugees at Balloki, Kasur during the [[Partition of British India]] in 1947]]
After the formation of Pakistan in 1947, the minority [[Hindu]]s and [[Sikh]]s migrated to India, while Muslim refugees migrated from India and settled in Kasur. Kasur emerged as a major centre of [[Tanning (leather)|leather tanning]] after independence, and is home to 1/3rd of Pakistan's tanning industry.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=exl4AgAAQBAJ&q=kasur+pakistan&pg=PA41|title=Pakistan|last=Heiden|first=Pete|date=1 September 2011|publisher=ABDO Publishing Company|isbn=9781617878275|language=en}}</ref>

Kasur is one of the biggest market and trading hub in the country of [[Hide (skin)|hides]] collection and [[Tanning (leather)|leather tanning]] and processing. In recent times, hide traders in Kasur were engaged in smuggling [[Donkey-hide gelatin|donkey hides]], a medicinal demand, to [[China]] via [[Port of Karachi|Karachi Port]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ansari|first=Afzal|date=14 November 2016|title=Some Kasur traders run racket: Donkey hide still 'a rage'|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1296221|access-date=15 February 2022|website=[[Dawn]]|language=en}}</ref>

In January 2018, two protestors were killed in rioting over the [[Murder of Zainab Ansari|rape and murder]] of [[Zainab Ansari]], a seven-year-old girl. There had been [[Kasur child sexual abuse scandal|12 similar murders]] in the past two years, five of which have been linked to one suspect, leading to widespread anger at police failures.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-42637027|work=[[BBC News]]|title=Zainab murder: Riots in Pakistan's Kasur after child rape and killing|date=10 January 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pakistani-anchor-goes-on-air-with-daughter-after-minors-brutal-rape-and-murder/articleshow/62457078.cms|work=[[The Times of India]]|title=Pakistani anchor goes on air with daughter to protest minor's brutal rape and murder|date=11 January 2018}}</ref>
