'''Datong''' is a [[prefecture-level city]] in northern [[Shanxi Province]] in the [[People's Republic of China]]. It is located in the [[Datong Basin]] at an elevation of {{convert|1040|m}} and borders [[Inner Mongolia]] to the north and west and [[Hebei]] to the east. As of the 2020 census, it had a population of 3,105,591 of whom 1,790,452 lived in the built-up (or metro) area made of the 2 out 4 [[Chinese district|urban districts]] of [[Chengqu, Datong|Pingcheng]] and [[Nanjiao District|Yungang]] as [[Datong County, Shanxi|Yunzhou]] and [[Xinrong District|Xinrong]] are not conurbated yet.

==History==
[[File:Datong jiulongbi.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nine-Dragon Wall]]]]
[[File:Datong bell tower.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Drum Tower (鼓楼)]]
The area of present-day Datong was close to the [[ancient Chinese states|state]] of [[Dai (Spring and Autumn)|Dai]], which was conquered by the [[state of Zhao|Zhao]] clan of [[Chinese state of Jin|Jin]] in 457 BC. It was a frontier land between the agricultural Chinese and the nomads of the [[Great Steppe]]. The area was well known for its trade in [[horses in East Asian warfare|horses]].

The area of present-day Datong eventually came under the control of the [[Qin dynasty]], during which it was known as '''Pingcheng County''' (平城县) and formed part of the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] [[Qin commanderies|commandery]] of [[Yanmen Commandery|Yanmen]].<ref>{{citation |last=Hou |first=Xiaorong |author-mask=Hou Xiaorong |script-title=zh:《秦代政区地理》 |trans-title=An Atlas of Qin-Era Administrative Divisions |date=2009 |publisher=Social Science Academic Press |location=Beijing }}. {{in lang|zh}}</ref> Pingcheng County continued under the [[Han dynasty]], which founded a site within present-day Datong in 200{{nbsp}}BC following its victory against the [[Xiongnu|Xiongnu nomads]] at the [[Battle of Baideng]]. Located near a pass to Inner Mongolia along the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]], Pingcheng blossomed under Han rule and became a stop-off point for camel caravans moving from China into Mongolia and beyond. It was sacked at the end of the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern Han]]. Pingcheng became the capital of the Xianbei-founded [[Northern Wei]] dynasty from AD{{nbsp}}398–494. The [[Yungang Grottoes]] were constructed during the later part of this period (460–494). During the mid to late 520s, Pingcheng was the seat of Northern Wei's [[Dai Commandery]].<ref name=daijun>{{harvp|Xiong|2009|loc=s.v. "[https://books.google.com/books?id=UD8Nvn7Ca18C&pg=PA106 Daijun]"}}.</ref> During the [[Tang dynasty]], Datong became the seat of the Tang prefecture of '''Yunzhou''', and the original Guandi temple was built.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Guandi Temple, Datong |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/china/datong/da06.html |access-date=2022-12-24 |website=www.art-and-archaeology.com}}</ref><ref name="britannica.com">{{Cite web |title=Datong {{!}} China {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Datong |access-date=2022-12-24 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

The city was renamed Datong in 1048. It was the '''Xijing''' ("Western Capital") of the [[Jurchens|Jurchen]] [[Jin dynasty (1115-1234)|Jin dynasty]] prior to being sacked by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. Datong later came under the control of the [[Ming dynasty]], serving as an important Ming military stronghold against the Mongols to the north.<ref name="britannica.com"/> During the Ming period, many of Datong's notable historical structures such as the Drum Tower and the Nine-Dragon Wall were built.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Drum Tower, Datong |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/china/datong/da01.html |access-date=2022-12-24 |website=www.art-and-archaeology.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Nine-Dragon Wall, Datong |url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/china/datong/da02.html |access-date=2022-12-24 |website=www.art-and-archaeology.com}}</ref> Datong was sacked again at the end of the Ming in 1649, but promptly rebuilt in 1652.

By 1982 a portion of its city walls remained so it became one of the [[List of National Famous Historical and Cultural Cities in China|National Famous Historical and Cultural Cities]] that year. Prior to 2008, about 100,000 people lived in the old city. In 2008 mayor Geng Yanbo decided to redevelop much of the inner city, with over {{convert|3|sqkm|sqmi}} being redeveloped, and with Geng becoming known as the "Demolition Mayor". Geng and his group anticipated that 30,000 to 50,000 people would remain in the old city.

In 2013 Geng left his position. Su Jiede of ''[[Sixth Tone]]'' wrote that much of the city was still under construction at the time and that Geng's efforts resulted in "a half-finished city center and a complicated legacy" and that "To critics, the city had spent enormous sums of money without much to show for it."<ref name=SuJiedeSixthToneMakeover>{{cite web|last=Su|first=Jiede|url=https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1006277/In%20Datong,%20a%20Crumbling%20Legacy%20of%20China’s%20Most%20Extreme%20Urban%20Makeover|title=In Datong, a Crumbling Legacy of China's Most Extreme Urban Makeover|date=2020-10-10|access-date=2020-10-16}}</ref> By 2020 the population of the old city was below 30,000 and there were fewer governmental facilities available for the residents. That year Su stated that the old city "still presents a headache for the local government."<ref name=SuJiedeSixthToneMakeover/>

==Demographics==
Su Jiede wrote that since [[Pingcheng District]], which had most of its urbanized area, had 1,105,699 people as of 2020, "Datong is a small city by [[List of cities in China by population|Chinese standards]]".<ref name=SuJiedeSixthToneMakeover/>

==Geography==
[[File:云岗石窟.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Yungang Grottoes]].]]

Datong is the northernmost city of Shanxi, and is located in the Datong Basin, with an administrative area spanning latitude 39° 03'–40° 44' N and longitude 112° 34'–114° 33' E. The urban area is surrounded on three sides by mountains, with passes only to the east and southwest. Within the prefecture-level city elevations generally increase from southeast to northwest. Datong borders [[Ulanqab]] ([[Inner Mongolia]]) to the northwest and [[Zhangjiakou]] ([[Hebei]]) to the east, [[Shuozhou]] (Shanxi) to the southwest, and [[Xinzhou, Shanxi|Xinzhou]] (Shanxi) to the south.

The well-known [[Datong Volcanic Arc]] lies nearby in the [[Datong Basin]].

It is {{convert|250|km|mi}} west of [[Beijing]].<ref name=SuJiedeSixthToneMakeover/>

===Climate===
Datong has a [[Continentality|continental]], [[monsoon]]-influenced [[steppe climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSk''), influenced by the {{convert|1000|m}}+ elevation, with rather long, cold, very dry winters, and very warm summers. Monthly mean temperatures range from {{convert|−10.5|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|22.6|°C|1}} in July; the annual mean temperature is {{convert|7.33|°C|1}}. Due to the aridity and elevation, [[diurnal temperature variation]] is often large, averaging {{convert|13.2|C-change}} annually. There barely is any precipitation during winter, and more than {{frac|3|4}} of the annual precipitation occurs from June to September. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 54% in July to 66% in October, sunshine is abundant year-round, and the city receives 2,671 hours (about 60% of the possible total) of bright sunshine per year. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from {{convert|-31.9|°C|0}} on 16 December 2023 to {{convert|39.2|°C|0}} on 29 July 2010.

*Defunct – [[Kuangqu, Datong|Kuang District]] ({{zh|s=矿区|p=Kuàngqū}}) is largely made up of separate mines throughout the metropolitan area.

==Tourism==
The [[Yungang Grottoes]] are a collection of shallow caves located {{convert|16|km|abbr=on}} west of Datong. There are over 50,000 carved images and statues of Buddhas and bodhisattvas within these grottoes, ranging from 4 centimeters to 7 meters tall.  Most of these icons are around 1500 years old.

Within the city itself, there are a few surviving sites of historical interest such as the [[Nine-Dragon Wall]], the [[Huayan Monastery]] ({{lang|zh-hans|华严寺}}; ''Huáyán Sì''), and the [[Shanhua Temple]]. Further afield is the [[Hanging Temple]] built into a cliff face near [[Mount Heng (Shanxi)|Mount Heng]]. Most of the historical sites in this region date to the Liao, Jin and Ming dynasties, but the Hanging Temple dates to the Northern Wei dynasty (386–534).

The railway locomotive works (see below) began to attract increasing numbers of railway enthusiasts from the 1970s. When the construction of steam locomotives was phased out, the authorities did not want to lose this valuable tourism market, and pondered the possibility of developing a steam railway operating center as an attraction. A number of study visits were undertaken to the [[East Lancashire Railway]] at [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]], and a twinning arrangement was concluded with that town.

In 2010, work began on reconstructing the city's 14th century Ming dynasty defensive wall. The controversial reconstruction project was in its final phase at the end of 2014.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fake it to make it |url= http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1627359/fake-it-make-it|newspaper= [[South China Morning Post]] Magazine|location=Hong Kong |access-date= 2 November 2014}}</ref> The documentary ''[[The Chinese Mayor]]''<ref>{{cite web|title=The Chinese Mayor|publisher=[[IMDb]] |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4056808/ }}</ref> documents two years of vigorous and highly controversial (due to summary demolition of about 200,000 homes) effort by Mayor [[Geng Yanbo]] to push the reconstruction project forward.

==Culture==
Datong is known for its [[knife-cut noodles]].<ref>https://inf.news/en/travel/988217c5317dd8bf472d38fff1883c87.html {{Bare URL inline|date=August 2022}}</ref>

==Economy==
The GDP per capita was ¥17,852 (US$2,570) per annum in 2008, [[List of cities in the People's Republic of China by GDP per capita|ranked]] no. 242 among 659 Chinese cities. Coal mining is the dominant industry of Datong. Its history and development are very much linked to this commodity.

Due to its strategic position, it is also an important distribution and warehousing center for Shanxi, Hebei and Inner Mongolia.<ref>[http://www.china-briefing.com/article/central-china:-datong-551.html China Briefing Business Guide] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221646/http://www.china-briefing.com/article/central-china:-datong-551.html |date=3 March 2016 }}.

Datong is an old fashioned coal mining city, and still sits on significant reserves of this commodity. Consequently, it has developed a reputation as one of China's most polluted cities. The Datong Coal Mining Group is based here and is China's third largest such enterprise. Datong is indeed however an emerging economy, as the city seeks to loosen its dependence on coal, introduce more environmentally friendly and efficient methods of extraction and move into other areas of business services. The local government has continued to upgrade its pillar coal sector (and related industries like coal chemicals, power and metallurgy), while also developing "substitute industries" such as machinery manufacturing, tourism and distribution, warehousing and logistics services. This has had some impact. Datong's GDP grew by 5.1 percent in 2008 to RMB56.6 billion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tjcn.org/datong/tjgb/10207.html|title=2008 Datong Economy Report}} {{Dead link|date=July 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

While coal will continue to dominate, Datong has been identified as one of the key cities requiring redevelopment, with part of this being in environmental cleanup, rehabilitation and industrial refocusing. Datong is a pilot city for rehabilitation studies following years of pollution. To this end it has already struck up strong relationships with other cities worldwide with similar backgrounds, and has begun plans, for example, to develop a tourism base focused on steam engine technology with antique locomotives to be used along designated tracks.<ref>[http://www.china-briefing.com/article/central-china:-datong-551.html China Briefing Business Guide: Datong Economy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303221646/http://www.china-briefing.com/article/central-china:-datong-551.html |date=3 March 2016 }}. China-briefing.com. Retrieved on 25 February 2014.</ref>

Datong has a large railway locomotive works '[[Datong locomotive factory]]', where the 'Aiming Higher' ({{lang-zh|s=前进|p=Qiánjìn}}) class of steam locomotive was built as late as the 1970s.  Steam locomotive production ended in the late 1980s and the plant's main products (as of 2010) is mainline electric locomotives.
