'''Bhiwandi'''  ({{audio|Bhiwandi.ogg|pronunciation}}) is a [[city]] in the [[Thane district]] of [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]. It is located {{convert|20|km}} northeast of [[Mumbai]], and {{convert|15|km|abbr=on}} northeast of the city of [[Thane]]. The city is a part of the [[Mumbai Metropolitan Region]].

Bhiwandi is a commercial city and a major trade center that connects Mumbai and the rest of India through the [[National Highway 3 (India, old numbering)|Mumbai–Agra highway]]. It is known for its textile industry, though in recent years, economic downturn has forced the closure of a large portion of the sector.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Shantha|first=Sukanya|date=14 October 2019|title=Bhiwandi's Textile Industry Is Struggling, and Political Apathy at Polltime Isn't Helping|url=https://thewire.in/labour/bhiwandis-textile-industry-is-struggling-to-survive-and-political-apathy-isnt-helping|access-date=2021-04-17|website=The Wire}}</ref>

Bhiwandi lies in the [[Konkan]]i coastal lowland, a region known geographically for its hills and streams. The city houses the [[tehsil]] headquarters of Bhiwandi, and it is administered by the [[Bhiwandi-Nizampur Municipal Corporation]].

Bhiwandi initially developed as an industrial hub for the textile industry, but more recently has hosted other industries and logistics sectors. Bhiwandi is among Asia's biggest warehousing hubs; its [[godown]]s are considered Asia's largest.<ref name="economictimes.indiatimes.com">{{Cite news|last=Bhatt|first=Shephali|title=Inside Indian Ecommerce sector's favourite logistics hub: Bhiwandi|url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/industry/services/retail/how-bhiwandi-has-rebuilt-itself-to-become-a-logistics-hub-for-online-retailers/articleshow/72201341.cms?from=mdr|newspaper=The Economic Times}}</ref> It is a major contributor to the logistic landscape of Mumbai and India due to its close proximity to the Nhava Seva port of Mumbai, India's financial capital. Many e-commerce companies like [[Delhivery]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Flipkart]], [[Reliance Industries]], [[Snapdeal]], and [[FedEx]] have branches in the city. The city is the next developed region for [[Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority|MMRDA]], which has developed other regions such as the [[Bandra Kurla Complex|Bandra–Kurla Complex]], [[Mumbai Metro]], Monorail Project, and Eastern Freeway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://businesstoday.intoday.in/story/amazon.in-to-open-second-warehouse-in-india/1/202488.html|title=Amazon.in to open second warehouse in India|work=intoday.in|date=20 January 2014 }}</ref>
