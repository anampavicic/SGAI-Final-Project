==Districts and neighborhoods==

===Midtown / Uptown===
[[File:HerschTower.JPG|thumb|[[Art Deco]] [[Hersch Tower]]<ref name=NYT1995/>]]
[[File:Goethe'sBridge.JPG|thumb|[[Goethals Bridge]]]]
[[Mid-Town Historic District (Elizabeth, New Jersey)|Midtown]], also occasionally known as Uptown, is the main commercial district and a historic section as well. It includes the First Presbyterian Church<ref name=EB1911/> and [[St. John's Episcopal Church, Elizabeth, N.J.|St. John's Episcopal Church]], and its [[St. John's Episcopal Churchyard]]. The First Presbyterian Church was a battleground for the American Revolution. Located here are also the 1931 [[Art Deco]] Hersh Tower,<ref name=NYT1995>Goodnough, Abby.

Midtown/Uptown includes the area once known as "Brittanville" which contained many English type gardens.

===Bayway===
Bayway is located in the southern part of the city and borders the City of Linden. From US 1&9 and Allen Street, between the Elizabeth River and the Arthur Kill, it has maintained a strong Polish community for years. Developed at the turn of the 20th century, many of the area residents once worked  at the refinery which straddles both Elizabeth and Linden. There are unique ethnic restaurants, bars, and stores along Bayway, and a variety of houses of worship. Housing styles are older and well maintained. There are many affordable two to four-family housing units, and multiple apartment complexes. The western terminus of the [[Goethals Bridge]], which spans the [[Arthur Kill]] to [[Staten Island]] can be found here. A small section of the neighborhood was isolated with both the completion of the Goethals Bridge in 1928 and the construction of the New Jersey Turnpike in the 1950s.

===Downtown / Elizabethport===
[[File:Park on Court St. in Elizabeth, NJ.jpg |thumb|School # 1 seen in the distance from the park on Court Street]]
[[File:Snyder Academy.jpg|thumb|[[Snyder Academy]]]]
Downtown / E-Port (a.k.a. The Port and Elizabethport) is the oldest neighborhood in Elizabeth. It consists of a collection of old world Elizabethan, new American colonial-style houses and apartment buildings that stretch east of 7th Street to its shores. The name is derived from its dependence on businesses catering to seagoing ventures. It was a thriving center of commerce between the 1660s through the middle of the 20th century. This area has had a great deal of improvement since 2000. Many homes have been renovated or been replaced with new, more ornate structures. Federal housing projects that stood for decades along First Street have been demolished and replaced with low to moderate income housing. The waterfront is home to new town homes and two-family homes (duplexes).

The area was once three distinct neighborhoods: Buckeye, Diamondville, and New Mexico. It was the US home of the [[Singer Manufacturing Company]], makers of Singer sewing machines, which constructed a {{convert|1400000|sqft|adj=on}} facility on a {{convert|32|acres|adj=on}} site in 1873. Shortly after it opened, the factory manufactured the majority of all sewing machines worldwide. With 6,000 employees working there in the 1870s, it employed the largest number of workers at a single facility in 1873. The company moved out of Elizabeth in 1982.<ref>Hatala, Greg.

Accessed September 19, 2016. "In 1873, the Singer Sewing Machine Manufacturing Co. purchased 32 acres of land in Elizabeth and established its first factory in the United States (the company also had a plant in Kilbowie, Clydebank, Scotland).... In 1982, the last 560 workers at the 1,400,000 square foot Elizabeth factory were laid off and the facility closed."</ref>

Elizabeth Marina, which was once filled with trash and debris along its walkway, was also restored. It is the site of year-round celebrations from a Hispanic festival in late spring to the lighting of a Christmas tree in winter. Living conditions in this area continue to improve year after year. Historically, there were immigrant communities centered around Christian churches. The Slavic community was centered by Sts. Peter and Paul Byzantine, the Lithuanian community attended Sts. Peter and Paul Roman Catholic and the Polish community attended St. Adalbert [[Roman Catholic Church]] which still stands. St. Patrick Church, originally Irish, dominates the 'Port; the cornerstone for the second and current building was laid in 1887.<ref>[http://www.visithistoricalelizabethnj.org/timeline.htm Elizabeth, NJ – A Concise Historical Overview] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513113117/http://visithistoricalelizabethnj.org/timeline.htm |date=May 13, 2011 }}, Visit Historical Elizabeth, NJ.

===Elmora and The West End===
[[File:Warinanco boathouse jeh.JPG|thumb|left|Warinanco Park in Elmora]]
Elmora is a middle/working-class neighborhood in the western part of Elizabeth. The main thoroughfare, Elmora Avenue, offers restaurants, shops and boutiques. Several high-rise building complexes, affording views of the New York City skyline, dot the edge of this neighborhood and are accessible to the [[Elizabeth station (NJ Transit)|Elizabeth station]]. The neighborhood area forms a "V" from its approximate borders of the Central Railroad tracks to Rahway Avenue.

====Elmora's modern Orthodox community====
The Elmora section of Elizabeth is home to a large [[Modern Orthodox]] community. The [[Jewish Educational Center]] of Elizabeth was founded in 1941 by a Latvian-born rabbi, [[Pinchas Mordechai Teitz]], who arrived to lecture in to the city's then-small Orthodox community in the 1930s.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/29/nyregion/rabbi-pinchas-m-teitz-87-founder-of-schools.html|title=Rabbi Pinchas M.

===Elmora Hills===
The northwestern part of Elmora is known as Elmora Hills. It is a strongly middle- to upper-middle-class neighborhood. Originally called Shearerville, the name Elmora came from the developers of the area, the El Mora Land Company. This area was annexed from [[Union Township, Union County, New Jersey|Union Township]], returning to Elizabeth in the early part of the 20th century. This was done to increase the city's tax base as major improvements to infrastructure were necessary at the time.

===Frog Hollow===
Frog Hollow is a small community of homes east of Atlantic Street, west of the Arthur Kill, and south of Elizabeth Avenue. Its name is derived from the frogs that could be caught in its marshes as well as the oyster and fishing of the past. The area expanded east and includes the area formerly known as Helltown. Helltown included many of the docks and shipyards, as well as several drydocks. The area's developer was Edward N. Kellogg, who also laid out the neighborhood in Keighry Head. Frog Hollow contains older-style, more affordable homes, rentals, and some quality restaurants in a working-class community. The statue honoring former Mayor Mack on Elizabeth Avenue is a landmark in the community. Frog Hollow is also convenient to the Veteran's Memorial Waterfront Park.

===Keighry Head===
Its name is attributed to James Keighry of the Isle of Kerry, Ireland. He owned a business facing the square formed at the junction of Jackson, Madison, Chestnut and Magnolia Avenues. The approximate borders of this neighborhood extended north from East Grand Street to Flora Street and from Walnut to Division Street. Developed by Edward N. Kellogg, many of the streets were named after family and friends. Keighry Head is located close to Midtown, containing affordable one and two-family homes, and apartment houses, convenient to the Midtown shopping district, and transportation.

===North End / North Elizabeth===
The North End, also known as "North Elizabeth", is a diverse working-class neighborhood. The borders are approximately the Arch north to the city line between North Broad Street and US 1&9. It was developed mostly in the 1920s for workers in the [[Duesenberg]] automobile plant (later Durant Auto, Burry Biscuits and Interbake Foods). The area was heavily settled by the Irish and then Portuguese. The North End has easy access to New York City and Newark via its [[North Elizabeth (NJT station)|own NJ Transit train station]], Routes 1 and 9 and the [[New Jersey Turnpike]]. The neighborhood also has Crane Square, the Historic Nugents Tavern, and Kellogg Park, and is within close proximity to [[Newark Liberty International Airport]]. There is a current plan to develop the former Interbake Foods facility into shopping and residential townhouses and condominiums. This community contains many larger one and two-family homes that have been rebuilt over the past decade. North Elizabeth also features many well-kept apartment houses and condominium units on and around North Avenue that are home to professionals who work in New York or the area. The only Benedictine women's community in New Jersey is located at Saint Walburga Monastery on North Broad Street.

===Peterstown===
[[File:Minuteman statue Union Sq Eliz jeh.jpg|thumb|War memorial in Union Square]]
Peterstown (also known as "The Burg") is a middle/working-class neighborhood in the southeastern part of the city. Its borders run west of Atlantic Street to South Spring Street from 1st Avenue to the Elizabeth River. Its name is derived from John Peters, who owned most of the land with George Peters. They divided the land and developed it during the end of the 19th century. The area was once predominantly occupied by its earliest settlers, who were German, and during the 1920s was gentrified by newly immigrated Italians. Peterstown has clean, quiet streets and has many affordable housing opportunities with a "village" feel. The area contains the historic Union Square, which is home to produce stands, meat markets, fresh fish and poultry stores. Peterstown is also home of the [[DeCavalcante crime family]], one of the most infamous [[American Mafia|Mafia]] families in the United States.

===The Point / the Crossroads===
The Point, formally known as the Crossroads, is centrally located and defined by New Point Road and Division Street. It is close to Midtown and contains many new affordable two-family homes, apartment houses and is undergoing a transformation. The former Elizabeth General Hospital site is currently being demolished and awaiting a new development.

===Quality Hill===
Home to St. Mary's and the "Hilltoppers", this area once was lined with mansions. Its approximate borders were South Broad Street to Grier Avenue and Pearl Street to what is now US 1&9. During its development in the 1860s it was the most fashionable area of the city to live. It is now a quiet middle class community experiencing a re-development with many new condominiums.

===Westminster===
Developed by Edward J. Grassman, Westminster got its name from the city's largest residential estates of the Tudor style and was inhabited by many residents who traced their ancestry to England. This neighborhood borders [[Hillside, New Jersey|Hillside]] with the Elizabeth River running its border creating a dramatic splash of greenery and rolling hills off of North Avenue, near Liberty Hall. Residents use this area for recreation, whether it is at the newly christened [[Phil Rizzuto]] Park area, or for bird watching or for sunbathing by the river. It is one of the more affluent areas of Elizabeth.

===Climate===
The climate in this area is characterized by hot, humid summers and cool to cold winters. According to the [[Köppen Climate Classification]] system, Elizabeth straddles the boundary between a [[humid subtropical climate]] and a hot-summer [[humid continental climate]].<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=725023&cityname=Elizabeth%2C+New+Jersey%2C+United+States+of+America&units= Climate Summary for Elizabeth, New Jersey] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630174822/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=725023&cityname=Elizabeth%2C+New+Jersey%2C+United+States+of+America&units= |date=June 30, 2014 }}, Weatherbase.com.

"Although Kitami, Hokkaido, and Elizabeth, New Jersey, have been sister cities for about 50 years, their ties go back to the early 1900s when two American missionaries settled in the town.... Kitami has shared historical and spiritual ties with Elizabeth since the time the Piersons settled there. On June 12, 1969, they became sister-cities to deepen their friendship and mutual understanding."</ref>
