The city is located in Eastern France, close to the [[Jura Mountains]] and the border with [[Switzerland]].

Capital of the historic and cultural region of [[Franche-Comté]], Besançon is home to the [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté]] regional council headquarters, and is an important administrative centre in the region. It is also the seat of one of the fifteen French [[ecclesiastical province]]s and one of the two [[1st Armored Division (France)|divisions]] of the [[French Army]].

In 2021 the city had a population of 119,198, in a metropolitan area of 283,127, the second in the region in terms of population.

Established in a [[meander]] of the river [[Doubs (river)|Doubs]], the city was already important during the Gallo-Roman era under the name of ''Vesontio'', capital of the [[Sequani]]. Its geography and specific history turned it into a military stronghold, a garrison city, a political centre, and a religious capital.

Besançon is the historical capital of [[watchmaking]] in France. This has led it to become a centre for innovative companies in the fields of [[microtechnology]], [[micromechanics]], and [[biomedical engineering]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=Beckett |first=Kathleen |date=2018-01-15 |title=The Watch Capital of France?

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Besançon}}

===Toponymy===
The city is first recorded in 58 BC as ''Vesontio'' in Book I of [[Julius Caesar]]'s ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]''. The etymology of ''Vesontio'' is uncertain. The most common explanation is that the name is of Celtic origin, derived from ''wes'', meaning 'mountain'. During the 4th century, the letter B took the place of the V, and the city name changed to ''Besontio'' or ''Bisontion'' and then underwent several transformations to become ''Besançon'' in 1243.
[[File:0 Besançon - Doubs - Quai Vauban (3).JPG|thumb|left|upright|The Doubs and the Quai Vauban seen from the Pont Battant.]]

===Ancient history===
[[File:Vesontio oppidum.jpg|thumb|Reconstruction of the Gallic (pre-Roman) [[oppidum]] of Vesontio]]

The city sits within an oxbow of the river Doubs (a tributary of the [[Saône]]); a mountain closes the fourth side. During the [[Bronze Age]], c. 1500 BC, tribes of Gauls settled the oxbow.

From the 1st century BC through the modern era, the town had a significant military importance because [[Alps|the Alps]] rise abruptly to its immediate south, presenting a significant natural barrier.

The Arar ([[Saône]]) River formed part of the border between the [[Haedui]] and their hereditary rivals, the [[Sequani]].{{CN|date=July 2022}} According to [[Strabo]], the cause of the conflict was commercial.<ref>[[Strabo]], ''Geography'' [https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?lookup=Strab.+4.3.1 4.3.2]</ref> Each tribe claimed the Arar and the tolls on trade along it. The Sequani controlled access to the [[Rhine]] and had built an [[oppidum]] (a fortified town) at Vesontio to protect their interests. The Sequani defeated and massacred the Haedui at the [[Battle of Magetobriga]], with the help of the [[Arverni]] tribe and the Germanic [[Suebi]] tribe under the Germanic king [[Ariovistus]].

[[Julius Caesar]], in his commentaries detailing his conquest of [[Gaul]], describes '''''Vesontio''''' (possibly [[Latin]]ized), as the largest town of the [[Sequani]], a smaller [[Gaul]]ic tribe, and mentions that a wooden palisade surrounded it. It appears as ''Vesontine'' in the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]].

Over the centuries, the name permutated to become '''''Besantio''''', '''''Besontion''''', '''''Bisanz''''' in [[Middle High German]], and gradually arrived at the modern French ''Besançon''. The locals retain their ancient heritage referring to themselves as ''Bisontins'' (feminine: ''Bisontine'').

It has been an [[archbishopric]] since the 4th century.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Kronung Heinrich II.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor]] inherited the city and made it part of the Holy Roman Empire in 1032.]]
In 843, the [[Treaty of Verdun]] divided up [[Charlemagne]]'s empire. Besançon became part of [[Lotharingia]], under the Duke of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]].

As part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] since 1034, the city became an [[Diocese|archbishopric]], and was designated the [[Free Imperial City of Besançon]] (an autonomous city-state under the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]) in 1184. In 1157, Emperor [[Frederick Barbarossa]] held the [[Diet of Besançon]]. There, Cardinal [[Orlando Bandinelli]] (the future Pope Alexander III, then adviser of [[Pope Adrian IV]]) openly asserted before the Emperor that the imperial dignity was a papal [[beneficium]] (in the more general sense of favour, not the strict feudal sense of [[fief]]), which incurred the wrath of the German princes. He would have fallen on the spot under the battle-axe of his lifelong foe, [[Otto I of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria|Otto of Wittelsbach]], had Frederick not intervened. The Archbishops were elevated to [[Princes of the Holy Roman Empire]] in 1288. The close connection to the Empire is reflected in the city's coat of arms.

In 1290, after a century of fighting against the power of the archbishops, the Emperor granted Besançon its independence.

===Renaissance===
In the 15th century, Besançon came under the influence of the dukes of [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]]. After the marriage of Mary of Burgundy to [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor]], the city was in effect a [[Habsburg]] fief. In 1519 [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], King of [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], became the Holy Roman Emperor. This made him master of the Franche-Comté and Besançon, a francophone imperial city. In 1526 the city obtained the right to mint coins, which it continued to strike until 1673. Nevertheless, all coins bore the name of Charles V.

When Charles V abdicated in 1555, he gave the Franche-Comté to his son, [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], King of Spain. Besançon remained a free imperial city under the protection of the King of Spain. In 1598, Philip II gave the province to his daughter on her marriage to an Austrian archduke. It remained formally a portion of the Empire until its cession at the peace of Westphalia in 1648. Spain regained control of Franche-Comté and the city lost its status as a free city. Then in 1667, [[Louis XIV]] claimed the province as a consequence of his marriage to [[Maria Theresa of Spain|Marie-Thérèse]] of Spain in the [[War of Devolution]].

Louis conquered the city for the first time in 1668, but the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1668)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] returned it to Spain within a matter of months. While it was in French hands, the famed [[military engineer]] [[Vauban]] visited the city and drew up plans for its fortification. The Spaniards built the main centre point of the city's defences, "la Citadelle", siting it on Mont Saint-Étienne, which closes the neck of the [[meander|oxbow]] that is the site of the original town. In their construction, the Spaniards followed Vauban's designs.

In 1674, French troops recaptured the city, which the [[Treaty of Nijmegen]] (1678) then awarded to France. At this time the city became the administrative centre for the Franche-Comté, with its own [[Parlement of Besançon]], which replaced [[Dole, Jura|Dole]].

[[File:Citadelle Besancon.JPG|left|thumb|The Citadel of Besançon by Vauban]]
As a result of control passing to France, Vauban returned to working on the citadel's fortifications, and those of the city. This process lasted until 1711, some 30 years, and the walls built then surround the city. Between the train station and the central city there is a complex moat system that now serves road traffic. Numerous forts, some of which date back to that time and that incorporate Vauban's designs elements sit on the six hills that surround the city: Fort de Trois Châtels, Fort Chaudanne, Fort du Petit Chaudanne, Fort Griffon, Fort des Justices, [[Fort of Beauregard (Besançon)|Fort de Beauregard]] and [[Fort of Bregille|Fort de Brégille]]. The citadel itself has two dry moats, with an outer and inner court. In the evenings, the illuminated Citadelle stands above the city as a landmark and a testament to Vauban's genius as a [[military engineer]].
{{Further|Fort of Rosemont}}

===Modern Europe===
In 1814, the Austrians invaded and bombarded the city. It also occupied an important position during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–71. In 1871, a project of [[Besançon Commune]] is engaged.

The [[Nazism|Nazis]] occupied the citadel during [[World War II]]. Between 1940 and 1944, the Germans executed some one hundred [[French resistance]] fighters there. However, Besançon saw little action during the war. The [[Allies of World War II|allies]] bombed the railway complex in 1943, and the next year the Germans resisted the U.S. advance for four days.

Besançon was also the location, between 1940 and 1941, of an Internment Camp (''Konzentrationslager''), [[Ilag|Frontstalag 142]], also known as ''Caserne Vauban'', which the Germans set up for 3–4,000 holders of British passports, all women and children. The conditions were harsh; many hundreds of internees died of pneumonia, diarrhea, food poisoning, dysentery, and frostbite.<ref>Shakespeare, Nicholas (2013) ''Priscilla: The Hidden Life of an Englishwoman in Wartime France''. (Harvill Secker).</ref>

In 1959, the French Army turned the citadel over to the city of Besançon, which turned it into a museum.

The forts of Brégille and Beauregard sit across the Doubs from the city. In 1913, a private company built a [[funicular]] to the Brégille Heights. The funicular passed from private ownership to the [[SNCF]], who finally closed it in 1987. The funicular's tracks, stations and even road signs remain in place to this day.

==Government and politics==
Until 2016, Besançon was the capital of the [[Franche-Comté]] administrative ''[[Regions of France|région]]'' of France, a ''région'' including the four ''départements'' of Doubs, [[Haute-Saône]], [[Jura (department)|Jura]] and [[Territoire de Belfort]]. Franche-Comté was since merged with the neighbouring region of [[Burgundy]], and the "préfecture" was transferred to the city of [[Dijon]]. However, Besançon remains the seat of the [[Bourgogne-Franche-Comté]] regional council and of various decentralised administrations such as the regional offices of the [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|French National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies]] (Insee) or the [[Centre régional des œuvres universitaires et scolaires]] (Crous).

Mayor of the City of Besançon is [[Anne Vignot]] ([[Europe Ecology – The Greens|The Greens]]).

==Economy==
The city is known for its [[microtechnology]] and watch industries.<ref name=":0" /> It is host of the biannual Micronora trade fair, one of Europe's major events in the field of microtechnologies.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Microtechnology, high precision, nanotechnology trade fair |url=https://micronora.com/en/the-trade-fair/ |access-date=2022-03-06 |website=Micronora |language=en-US}}</ref> The city has a little-known specialty, automatic ticketing machines for car parking, airports, date stamping etc.

The watch industry, for which Besançon remains the French capital, endured a major crisis in the 1970s when the advent of quartz watches from Asia knocked out the traditional watch industry in the space of just a few years. The [[LIP (clockwork company)|"Lip" affair]] epitomizes the industrial crisis.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} LIP is to this day the name of one of Besançon's most prestigious brands of watches.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}} Refusing to let their factory close, the workers set up a [[worker cooperative|cooperative]] to run it. The action produced a lot of notoriety and sympathy for the workers but also resulted in branding Besançon as a city of the radical left. It also did nothing to help revive the watch industry; the cooperative went out of business a short while later. The city took a long time to recover from the collapse of the watch industry and its other major industry of the industrial age, artificial textiles.

Since the 1980s, Besançon's watch industry has clawed its way back on the basis of its historic reputation and quartz watches, establishing itself in a number of niche markets including customized watches, high quality watches, and fashion articles. Since the 1990s, the town has developed a reputation as one of France's leading centres of technology in all fields, including telecommunications and biotechnology.

==Education==
Besançon is the seat of the [[University of Franche-Comté]]. {{As of|2018}}, there were approximately {{formatnum:24000}} students enrolled at the university, including around {{formatnum:3000}} foreign students. The Institut Supérieur d'Ingénieurs de Franche-Comté<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isifc.univ-fcomte.fr/|title=Institut Supérieur d'Ingénieurs de Franche-Comté (Besançon) web site |access-date=20 June 2011}}</ref> (ISIFC), part of the Université de Franche-Comté, is the first school created in the country specifically for the [[Biomedical engineering]] field. The city is also home of the [[École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et des Microtechniques]] (ENSMM), a technological school with a strong reputation in the fields of [[microtechnology]] and [[mechanics]] and the [[Centre for Applied Linguistics]] which teaches ten languages to non-native speakers (French, Arabic, Chinese, English, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish) and any other known language on request. The Centre welcomes more than {{formatnum:4000}} students every year from all over the world. As well as being famed as one of France's finest "villes d'art" (art cities), Besançon is the seat of one of France's older universities, of France's [[ENSMM|National School of Mechanics and Micromechanics]], and one of the best known French language schools in France, the CLA.

==Landmarks==
The most historic center of the town is characterised by the broad horse-shoe of the river Doubs, "la Boucle", which encircles the old town. [[Vauban]]'s imposing [[Citadel of Besançon|Citadelle blocks]] off the neck. The historic center presents an ensemble of classic stone buildings, some dating back to the [[Middle Ages]] and others to the Spanish Renaissance.{{citation needed|date=October 2020}}

===Gallo-Roman remains===
During Antiquity, Vesontio was an important metropolis of [[Roman Gaul]]. It is adorned with monuments, some of which have survived, [[archaeological excavation]]s carried out during construction sites often revealing new discoveries dating from this period.

The most emblematic and best-preserved monument dating from this period is the [[Porte Noire]], a Gallo-Roman [[triumphal arch]] built under [[Marcus Aurelius]] in the 2nd century in the Saint-Jean district. Heavily deteriorated by the vagaries of time and pollution, it was the subject of a long and difficult restoration operation at the beginning of the 21st century. Immediately below is the Square Castan, a garden with a collection of archaeological remains from the 2nd century or the 3rd century including in particular eight [[Corinthian column]]s.

On the other bank of the river Doubs, in the Battant district, the remains of the Vesontio arena are visible: only a few steps and foundations have been unearthed, its stones having been widely used in the [[Middle Ages]] for the construction of other buildings.

There are several domus in the residential district of Vesontio. Among them, the domus of the Palace of Justice and the domus of the Lumière college with Roman mosaic exhibited in situ at the Besançon Museum of Fine Arts and Archeology. Other remains can be seen in more anonymous places, such as the ancient foundations in the underground car park of the Bourgogne-Franche-Comté regional council.

=== Fortifications and military buildings ===
Most of the current fortification system ([[Citadel of Besançon|citadel]], [[defensive wall]] made up of [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] and [[bastion]]s, Fort Griffon) is the work of the [[military engineer]] [[Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban]]. This group of buildings allows Besançon to appear on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] with eleven other sites under the title [[Fortifications of Vauban]]. The forts on the other hills were all built in the 19th century. The only remaining pre-Vauban fortifications are Porte Rivotte, Porte Taillée, Tour Carrée, Tour Notre-Dame and Tour de la Pelote.

The citadel of Besançon was built by Vauban from 1678 to 1771 and is the most visited site in [[Franche-Comté]] with more than 250,000 visitors each year. It extends over eleven hectares at the top of Mont Saint-Étienne at an altitude between 330 and 370 meters, thus overhanging the meander of the river Doubs which has an altitude between 240 and 250 meters. It brings together a museum of Resistance and Deportation, a museum of Franche-Comté traditions, the regional archeology service and a zoo. It is the symbol of the city. Fort Griffon, whose name is that of the Italian architect Jean Griffoni who was commissioned to build a first fortification at this location in 1595, is a second citadel. It was Vauban who, at the end of the 17th century, had the current fort built.

The city walls designed by Vauban includes all the fortifications of La Boucle historic district which were rebuilt from 1675 to 1695. Vauban in fact replaced the medieval defenses restored and completed by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in the sixteenth century with a belt provided with six bastioned [[battery tower]]s : the Notre-Dame tower, the bastioned tower of Chamars, the bastioned tower of the Marais, the bastioned tower of the Cordeliers (completed in 1691), the bastioned tower of Bregille and the bastioned tower of Rivotte.

</gallery>

Fortifications prior to the French conquest are also numerous. The Tour de la Pelote, located on the Quai de Strasbourg, is a defensive tower built in 1546 by the municipal government on the orders of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]]. Its name would come from the former owner of the land where it was built, Pierre Pillot, lord of Chenecey. The Porte Rivotte is a city gate dating from the 16th century, consisting of two round towers and a pediment carved with a sun which was King [[Louis XIV]]'s personal emblem. The Porte Taillée ("Carved Gate"), opened in a rocky outcrop, is the work of the Romans. It marks the entrance to the city on the road to Switzerland. It is surmounted by a guardhouse and a watchtower built in 1546. The “square tower”, located in the promenade des Glacis, is also called the Montmart tower. It was built in the 13th century to defend the old entrance to the Battant district.

The fortifications of the 19th century consist of a set of forts covering all the heights of the city: the fort of Chaudanne built from 1837 to 1842, the fort of Bregille built from 1820 to 1832, the fort of Planoise built from 1877 to 1880, Fort Benoit was built from 1877 to 1880, Fort Beauregard in 1830.

Another example are the Trois-Châtels and Tousey [[Lunette (fortification)|lunette]]s, both built at the end of the 18th and early 19th centuries, as well as the Rosemont battery built during the war of 1870–1871, the Fort des Montboucons built from 1877 to 1880 and the Fort des Justices built from 1870. A third Lunette d'Arçon was located on the site of Fort Chaudanne; only its tower was preserved during the construction of the fort in the first half of the 19th century.

The Ruty barracks, formerly Saint-Paul barracks, are made up of four pavilions surrounding a courtyard serving as a [[Place d'Armes]] and dating from the 18th and 19th centuries. It currently houses the headquarters of the [[1st Armored Division (France)|1st Armored Division]] and the [[7th Armoured Brigade (France)|7th Armoured Brigade]].

=== Places of worship ===
After the city acquired an [[episcopal see]] in the 3rd century, churches and abbeys multiplied during the period of the [[High Middle Ages]]. Important constructions or reconstructions of religious buildings then took place in the 11th century during the episcopate of Hugues Ier de Salins and many churches were embellished or rebuilt after the French conquest of 1674. In 1842, the Church of the Holy Spirit was officially ceded to the [[Protestantism in France|Protestant]] community while the [[Judaism in France|Jewish]] community inaugurated its [[synagogue]] in 1869. Finally, the [[Islam in France|Muslim]] community had two [[mosque]]s built at the end of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century.

The most important religious building dedicated to Catholic worship in Besançon is [[Besançon Cathedral|Saint John's Cathedral]], of [[Gothic architecture]], dating from the 9th, 12th and 18th centuries. It has two [[apse]]s and contains a masterpiece by [[Fra Bartolomeo]], the painting of the ''Madonna in Glory with Saints'' painted in 1512. The cathedral dominates the old [[Cathedral chapter|chapter]] district which includes the [[Archbishopric]] of Besançon located in the former Hôtel Boistouset and the former Archbishop's Palace currently occupied by the [[Rector (academia)|Rectorate]] of the [[academy]]. The Grand [[Seminary]] was built from 1670 to 1695 by Archbishop Antoine-Pierre Ier de Grammont and completed in the 18th century by the elevation of the portal and the construction of the main facade. The chapel has a two-storey facade of Corinthian pilasters on the street. Its portal is surmounted by a tympanum where the sculptor Huguenin represented a Madonna and Child in 1848.

At the other end of the old [[cardo]] and current Grande Rue, is the [[Église de la Madeleine (Besançon)|Sainte-Madeleine church]] built from 1746 to 1766 on plans by Nicolas Nicole. It was definitively completed in 1828–1830 with the construction of its two towers, one of which hosts the [[Jacquemart (bellstriker)|Jacquemart bellstriker automaton]]. Its roof is made of [[polychrome]] [[Ceramic tile|glazed tile]]s.

In the heart of the city centre, St Peter's Church, built by the Bisontin Claude Joseph Alexandre Bertrand from 1782 to 1786, impresses with the height of its bell tower which served as a [[belfry (architecture)|belfry]] for the town hall which is opposite. St Maurice's Church, founded in the 6th century, was rebuilt from 1711 to 1714 with a Jesuit-style facade surmounted by a carillon. Notre-Dame Church corresponds to the former Benedictine abbey of Saint-Vincent which was founded in the eleventh century. It was under the Empire that it became the parish church of Notre-Dame. Its facade was designed in 1720 by the architect Jean-Pierre Galezot. You can still make out the large entrance gate to the abbey and the 16th-century bell tower. Today it is occupied by the Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences. Saint-François-Xavier Church, former chapel of the Jesuit college, was built between 1680 and 1688. Its plan is in the shape of a Latin cross surrounded by small side chapels. It was decommissioned in 1975. The Saint-Paul abbey, church of the former abbey founded around 628 by Saint Donat, archbishop of Besançon, was rebuilt in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The Notre-Dame-du-Foyer chapel, built from 1739 to 1745 by the Bisontin Nicolas Nicole, was once the chapel of the Couvent du Refuge before being attached to the Saint-Jacques hospital in 1802.

Outside the old town, among the important Catholic buildings, is the Saint-Ferjeux basilica of Romano-Byzantine style built on the cave of the patron saints of Besançon, Saint Ferjeux and Saint Ferréol. Notre-Dame des Buis, a 19th-century chapel, overlooks the city at an altitude of 491 metres.
[[File:Besançon, la synagogue (1).jpg|thumb|right|Synagogue of Besançon]]
The Protestant community was assigned in 1842 the former hospice of the Holy Spirit, today the temple of the Holy Spirit. It is a 13th-century Gothic building augmented by a 15th-century chapel and deprived of its bell tower during the Revolution. It is distinguished by its gallery of sculpted wood, a masterpiece by an anonymous artist. Its neo-Gothic portal was created in 1841 by the architect Alphonse Delacroix in place of the old porch.

The Jewish community, booming in the city in the middle of the 19th century, built the [[synagogue of Besançon]] from 1869 to 1871 on plans by the architect Pierre Marnotte. Listed as a historic monument in 1984, it is particularly remarkable for its [[Moors|Moorish]] style inspired by the Alhambra in Granada.

The most recently built places of worship in Besançon are of Muslim faith: the Sounna Mosque built at the end of the 20th century on land ceded by the city in the Saint-Claude district, and the Al-Fath located in the district of Planoise.

=== Government and residentials buildings ===
In the [[16th century]], many [[palace]]s and [[mansion]]s were erected in the Boucle and Battant districts. The most important is the Palais Granvelle with [[Renaissance architecture]] built for [[Nicolas Perrenot de Granvelle]], Chancellor and Keeper of the Seals of [[Emperor Charles V]]. It now houses the Museum of Time. The Town Hall was built by the architect Richard Maire who completed it in 1573. It has an [[ashlar]] facade in the spirit of Italian Renaissance palaces. Until the Revolution, a large niche in the facade housed a bronze statue of Charles V riding a two-headed eagle. The Palais de Justice ([[Court of Appeal]]) was originally the second main building of the town hall. In 1582, the municipality decided to enlarge the town hall to establish its court and its chapel. The construction was entrusted to the architect Hugues Sambin who was greatly inspired by the spirit of the Renaissance. The Hôtel de Champagney was built in the Battant district by Jacques Bonvalot, Lord of Champagney, during the first half of the 16th century. His daughter Nicole Bonvalot, widow of Nicolas de Granvelle, had the premises redesigned and the courtyard designed from 1560 to 1565 by architect Richard Maire. It is distinguished by the four [[gargoyle]]s that adorn its facade and by its interior courtyard with arched passageways and galleries with wooden columns. The Hôtel Mareschal belonged to an important Besançon family, the Mareschal family. Burnt down on June 4, 1516, Guillaume Mareschal had it rebuilt in 1532 with an ornamental flora that heralded the Renaissance. Other notable buildings dating from the sixteenth century are the Hôtels of Chevanney, Gauthiot d'Ancier, Anvers, Bonvalot, and Bouteiller. At that time, the hills around Besançon were covered with [[vineyard]]s: the city has preserved from this important viticultural past a dozen ''cabordes'', former vineyard huts made of dry [[limestone]].

Immediately after the French conquest, the installations were mainly of a military nature. However, two other notable constructions were erected at the end of the 17th century. Work on the Saint-Jacques hospital, which was intended to replace the one located on rue d'Arènes, began in 1688 and was completed in 1701. Its monumental entrance gate, executed by the locksmith Nicolas Chapuis in 1703 has been replaced by a copy. The Vauban Quay was built from 1691 to 1695 by the engineer Isaac Robelin. It is a monumental set of houses with arcades.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]], the town's urban planning underwent major transformations and the construction of remarkable buildings, notably due to its new status as capital. The Hôtel de l'Intendance, currently [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the [[Doubs departement]], was built from 1771 to 1778 at the request of the intendant Charles André de Lacoré. The plans were drawn up by the great Parisian architect [[Victor Louis]] and the work directed by the bisontin architect Nicolas Nicole. It adopts the traditional plan of private mansions, with a main courtyard with a facade made up of six Ionic columns surmounted by a pediment and a garden at the rear of the building whose facade is decorated with a rotunda jutting out slightly. on the garden. The Théâtre Ledoux is an order from Monsieur de Lacoré to [[Claude-Nicolas Ledoux]] who drew up the plans and entrusted the construction to Claude-Joseph-Alexandre Bertrand which began in 1778 and ended with its inauguration on August 9, 1784 under the crook of Louis V Joseph of Bourbon-Condé. With a capacity of 2,000 seats, it was considered very innovative, as it had a seated parterre, an amphitheater hall without boxes, and it was the first in the world to have an [[orchestra pit]]. On April 29, 1958, a dramatic fire completely destroyed the interior and the roof of the building. The walls are the only witnesses that have survived, including the facade and its six monumental columns. Many mansions also attest to the prosperity of the city during this period. The Hotel Terrier de Santans was built between 1770 and 1772 for the Marquis Terrier de Santans, first president of parliament, by the architect Claude Bertrand. Other eminent families call on the greatest architects for their homes: the Hôtels Petit de Marivat, de Magnoncourt, Boistouset, de Courbouzon, de Clévans, de Camus, Querret, Terrier, and de Rosières.

If the thermal baths of Besançon were completely destroyed in the 1950s, the city retains a number of buildings emblematic of its thermal past: the Grand Hôtel des Bains inaugurated in 1893, the municipal casino installed in a Belle Époque-style building inaugurated in 1882 or the Kursaal opened in 1893. It was also during this period that the [[Besançon Astronomical Observatory|astronomical observatory]] and the Café du Commerce were erected, a brasserie from the second half of the 19th century with a rich interior decor in the Belle Époque style.

[[History of clockmaking in Besançon|Besançon's specialization in watchmaking]] has also left its mark on the city's heritage. The [[Besançon astronomical clock|astronomical clock]] located inside St. John's cathedral was commissioned in 1858 by Cardinal Mathieu from Auguste-Lucien Vérité. Composed of 30,000 mechanical parts, 57 dials and presenting 122 all interdependent indications, it is considered a masterpiece of its kind and classified as a Historic Monument in 1991. The National School of Watchmaking was built from 1928 to 1932 by the architect Paul Guadet. This imposing Art Deco building with a monumental clock on its facade now houses the Lycée Jules-Haag. The Dodane watch factory, completed in 1943, is an L-shaped reinforced concrete building whose construction was entrusted to the architect [[Auguste Perret]] who also designed the interior decor elements. It has a private garden with swimming pool and tennis court. In the twenty-first century, two monumental clocks, works by Bisontin Philippe Lebru from the Utinam workshop, were installed on the facade of the Besançon Museum of Fine Arts and inside the Besançon Franche-Comté TGV station.

In addition to the watchmaking heritage, other buildings with notable architecture were built during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries. The Canot university campus was built from 1929 by the architect René Tournier and inaugurated by the President of the Republic Albert Lebrun in 1933. It was the first university residence in France. The Higher Institute of Fine Arts was built between 1970 and 1974 to plans by the Catalan architect [[Josep Lluís Sert]]. The Cité des Arts inaugurated in 2013 is the work of the Japanese architect [[Kengo Kuma]].

===Parks and gardens===
With {{convert|5950|acre|sqmi km2}} of [[urban open space]]s, including {{convert|4942|acre|sqmi km2}} of [[forest]]s, Besançon is considered the first green city in France with 204 m2 of green spaces per capita. The [[Forest of Chailluz]], covering {{convert|4015|acre|sqmi km2}}, represents a quarter of the total area of the commune. The city is the owner of this mainly [[deciduous]] forest, which includes a wildlife park and a [[fitness trail]] in addition to numerous trails. The historic center is entirely surrounded by green spaces. To the west of the old town, on the left bank of the Doubs, are the Jardins de la Gare-d'Eau: in 1833, the construction of the [[Rhone-Rhine Canal]] led the city to create a small port river shipping but it quickly fell into disuse after the opening of a [[canal tunnel]] under the citadel. The {{convert|5|acre|sqmi km2}} park around the basin is currently owned by the [[Departmental council (France)|departmental council]] of [[Doubs]]. The Chamars Promenade, attached to these gardens but further north, built in the fourth quarter of the eighteenth century, owes its name to the contraction of Champ de Mars ([[Field of Mars]]). It was at first a [[marshland]] separated into two parts by an arm of the River Doubs: the big and the small Chamars. [[Vauban]], judging this place vulnerable, fortified it with the help of [[Rampart (fortification)|ramparts]] and [[bastion]]s. The city obtained permission to turn this space into a promenade in 1739. The architect Bertrand remodeled it between 1770 and 1778 by incorporating a café, public baths, an [[aviary]] of rare birds, waterfalls, a botanical garden and many plantings. It largely disappeared after 1830 with the leveling of the inner rampart and the creation of the Gare d'Eau port. A public garden was refurbished between 1978 and 1982. The only surviving elements of the former Chamars Promenade are the two guard houses, some plane trees, and the stone vases of the sculptor Jean-Baptiste Boutry.

North of the historic district of Battant, on the right bank of the River Doubs, the Glacis Promenade, created in the middle of the nineteenth century, is the work of the landscape architect Brice Michel and the architect Boutterin. Right in the heart of this district, the Clos Barbisier is a garden created in 1988 and presenting an important variety of [[rose]]s. The green belt extends east of the old town, still on the right bank of the River Doubs, by the Promenade of Helvetia which houses a botanical garden called Jardin des Sens et des Senteurs (Garden of Senses and Scents) realized in 1987, accessible to the visually impaired thanks to its plants and shrubs with certain sensory features (smell, touch), and [[Braille]] signs. Directly to the south is the Micaud Promenade, which has been progressively developed over {{convert|7|acre|sqmi km2}} from 1843 on plans by architect Alphonse Delacroix. It is named after Jules Micaud, the mayor who promoted the project. It includes more than four hundred trees, including a [[Magnolia grandiflora|southern magnolia]] and a [[Fagus sylvatica|European beech]], a [[bandstand]], a pond, and several sculptures. The Jardins du Casino, a public garden with flowering lawns and tree-lined avenues, is directly on the other side of Edouard Droz Avenue, which runs along Micaud Promenade.
 
In the heart of the historic center, the Promenade Granvelle is the former private garden of the sixteenth century Granvelle Palace, which the municipality acquired in 1712 and which was opened to the public in 1728. The architect Bertrand redeveloped it into a public garden from 1775 to 1778. It includes a bandstand, an artificial cave, a [[Wallace fountain]], statues of [[Victor Hugo]] and Auguste Veil-Picard, the portal of the church of the convent of the Great Carmelites, and a neoclassical colonnade, a remnant of a refreshment pavilion. The first [[botanical garden]] in Besançon was created in 1580. It then occupied more than ten different sites, including the current location of Place Leclerc since 1957. The Parc de l'Observatoire, created in 1904 at the request of the director of the astronomical observatory Auguste Lebeuf, is home to a purple beech, a weeping beech, chestnut and pine trees.

A statue of [[Henri Bouchot]] stands in Besançon's Henri-Bouchot square. It was originally in bronze but was melted down by the [[Vichy régime]]. The replacement in stone was made by [[Georges Saupique]].

==Culture==

===Museums and galleries===
[[File:Besançon, le musée des Beaux-Arts et d'Archéologie (La Déploration sur le Christ mort - Bronzino).jpg|thumb|[[Musée des Beaux-Arts et d'archéologie de Besançon|Museum of Fine Arts and Archeology]]]]
There are five museums in Besançon that all bear the designation "[[Museum of France]]". Besançon has one of the finest city art galleries in France outside Paris. The [[Musée des Beaux-Arts et d'archéologie de Besançon|Museum of Fine Arts and Archeology]], created in 1694, was the first museum created in France and predates [[The Louvre]] by almost a century. It has benefited from a remarkable series of bequests over time.

In the 1960s the architect [[Luis Miquel]], a pupil of [[Le Corbusier]], totally rebuilt the building. The building's interior takes the form of a gently rising concrete walkway that takes visitors up from classical antiquity to the modern age. Among the museum's treasures are a fine collection of classical antiquities and ancient Egyptian artifacts, as well as a very rich collection of paintings including works by [[Giovanni Bellini|Bellini]], [[Bronzino]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Titian]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], [[Jordaens]], [[Jacob Isaakszoon van Ruisdael|Ruisdael]], [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]], [[Zurbarán]], [[Francisco Goya|Goya]], [[Philippe de Champaigne]], [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard]], [[François Boucher|Boucher]], [[Jacques-Louis David|David]], [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Géricault]], [[Gustave Courbet|Courbet]], [[John Constable|Constable]], [[Pierre Bonnard|Bonnard]], [[Matisse]], [[Picasso]] and many others.

The Musée du Temps (Museum of Time), inaugurated in 2002, was formerly the City's History Museum. Located in the Granvelle Palace, its concept is unique in Europe, grouping watch collections (watches, [[sundial]]s, [[hourglass]]es, all means of measuring time ...) and the funds of the history museum (paintings, engravings). In addition, three museums are grouped inside the Vauban citadel.

The Museum of Resistance and Deportation has been open since 1971 and is one of the largest in its category at the national level. It consists of twenty rooms, retracing the themes related to the Second World War (Nazism, the Occupation, the [[Vichy regime]], the Resistance, Liberation, Deportation) through photographs, texts, documents and original collectibles. The establishment also has two rooms dedicated to artists whose works were made in [[concentration camp]]s.

The Comtois Museum, installed in 1961 in the Royal Front, presents regional arts and traditions through sixteen permanent exhibition halls with collections of more than 20,000 objects, mainly from the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.

The Museum of Natural History, created in 1959 under the leadership of Mayor Jean Minjoz, presents varied backgrounds in a small evolutionary course around collections of natural sciences (naturalized animals, herbaria ...); it also presents live animals in four sectors (zoo, insectarium, noctarium and aquarium). Besançon is also home to the birthplace of [[Victor Hugo]], presenting the humanist political commitment of the writer. The Cité des Arts exhibits part of the works of the regional fund of [[contemporary art]] of Franche-Comté.

===Performing arts centers===

[[File:La_Rodia_Besançon.JPG|thumb|La Rodia concert hall]]
The city is home to a National Center for Dramatic Art, the Centre dramatique national Besançon Franche-Comté created in 1972. This theater installed in the former [[ballroom]] of the Casino has a capacity of 337 seats. The Scène nationale de Besançon performs since 2012 in two facilities including the Théâtre de l'Espace and the Théâtre Ledoux. The Théâtre Ledoux was inaugurated in 1784 and can accommodate 1100 people. Besançon also has smaller structures. The Scénacle located in the Saint-Jean district is a small theater with a capacity of about 100 seats that offers plays and concerts by the troupe or regional artists. On campus, the 150-seat Petit Théâtre de la Bouloie welcomes student projects to promote artistic and cultural practice (university theater, university choir...), artistic residencies of young companies, professional shows proposed by the partner structures and shows of young companies.

The Kursaal is the result of the will to offer entertainment and shows to spa guests of the spa resort of Besançon-les-Bains created in 1891 and military garrison in the city. The Kursaal-Circus opened at the end of 1893, but the promoter's finances, Madame Veuve Pellegrin, did not allow her to reimburse the expenses incurred. The city acquired it in 1895 and the Kursaal became the city's [[concert hall]]. It closes in 1970 for reasons of obsolescence, before being renovated from 1979 and reopened in September 1982. A conference room with 360 seats, called Petit Kursaal was also created in the basement. The main hall, known as Grand Kursaal, has two balconies and a dome ceiling decorated with frescoes reminiscent of the circus arts. Its capacity can go up to 1,038 seats including 450 on both balconies.

Bands play throughout the year at La Rodia, located in the Prés-de-Vaux neighborhood. It includes a large 900-seat theater and a 330-seat "club" hall as well as two creative studios. The Micropolis Exhibition Center houses a modular hall with a capacity of 2,200 to 6,500 seats, where the majority of artists and bands on national and international tours are performing.

The city is home to the Victor Hugo Franche-Comté Orchestra.

===Cinema===
There are two [[multiplex cinema]]s, the Mégarama Beaux-Arts in the historic district and Mégarama École-Valentin in the suburban area. The Cinéma Victor-Hugo is a smaller cinema promoting [[Independent film|indie movies]], located in the city center.

===Annual cultural events and fairs===
The city of Besançon hosts many festive and cultural events.

Several music festivals punctuate the year, the most emblematic and the oldest of which is the [[Besançon International Music Festival|Besançon Franche-Comté International Music Festival]], created in 1948 and held every year in September. This festival honors the [[Symphony|symphonic]] repertoire, [[chamber music]] and [[recital]]s. It was completed in 1951 by the International Contest of Young [[Conducting|Conductors]] held every two years (odd years), one of the most prestigious of the discipline which counts among its laureates [[Seiji Ozawa]], [[Gerd Albrecht]], [[Michel Plasson]] or [[Zdeněk Mácal]].

The Festival Détonation is another highlight of September: created in 2012 and organized by La Rodia, its programming mixes pop music, electronic music and interactive mapping installations.

Initiated in 2007, the GéNéRiQ Festival takes place in February in five cities: [[Belfort]], Besançon, [[Dijon]], [[Montbéliard]] and [[Mulhouse]]. Its programming is also focused on new musical trends such as electro clubbing, mediterranean surf, free metal, electro blues, alternative hip hop or neo ghetto folk.

Created in 1981, the Jazz and improvised music festival in Franche-Comté offers concerts in Besançon and other towns in the region in June.

The Circasismic Festival, held in May since 2015, presents a program of electro, dub and rock music as well as circus and street theater shows.

The Orgue en ville festival, created in 2009, offers about twenty concerts around the organ in religious buildings of Besançon and its agglomeration. It takes place between the end of June and the beginning of July.

The Besançon-Montfaucon Festival offers musical works played on [[period instrument]]s.

The Foire Comtoise is a trade fair and a [[Traveling carnival|travelling funfair]] held in the Micropolis exhibition center. This event created in 1922 was originally an agricultural fair. It now hosts around 600 exhibitors and 140,000 visitors around the [[Feast of the Ascension]] weekend. Each year, a country or a community is a guest of honor and presents its crafts and its customs and traditions through shows.

Since 1995, the Gourmet Instants market has been held on the Granvelle Promenade in September and showcases local gastronomic products.

The Christmas market in Besançon has been spreading throughout December since 1993, while a carnival parade has been held since 1978, bringing together 20,000 to 30,000 people each year in the streets of the city center.

The Grand Besançon Métropole book festival (Livres dans la Boucle) take place in September. Running over three days, it hosted in 2018 more than 200 authors and 30,000 visitors.

An African cinema festival called Lumières d'Afrique has been held in November since 1996.

==Sports==
The practice of sport in the agglomeration of Besançon is quite diverse, on the one hand because the municipality does not want to bet everything on one or two professional disciplines that would carry the colors of the city high, but rather to encourage its population to practice all disciplines, and on the other hand because the particular setting of the city (hills, cliffs, rivers) makes it possible to practice a wide range of [[Outdoor recreation|outdoor sports]] such as [[hiking]], [[mountain biking]], [[climbing]], [[rowing]].

===Sports venues===

The Golf de Besançon is an 18-hole [[golf course]] in the town of [[La Chevillotte]].

===Professional teams and sportspeople===
In the field of team sports, the city is currently represented at the national level mainly in the discipline of [[handball]]. The [[ESBF Besançon|Entente Sportive Bisontine Feminine (ESBF)]] club, founded in 1970, plays in the [[French Women's Handball Championship|French Women's First League]]. It is the most successful club in the city with notably 4 French league titles and a [[Women's EHF Cup Winners' Cup|European Cup]].

Former [[Besançon BCD]], now defunct, played nine seasons in the top-tier men's professional basketball league in France and counted [[Bruce Bowen]], [[Tanoka Beard]] and [[Tony Farmer]] among its most famous players.

In the field of individual sports at professional and amateur level, the city stands out in boxing with Olympic medalist [[Khedafi Djelkhir]], wrestling with Olympic medalist [[Ghani Yalouz]], archery with [[Jean-Charles Valladont]] several times medalist at the World and European championship and silver medalist at the Rio Olympics, judo, cycling (Amicale Cycliste Bisontine), weightlifting (La Française de Besançon) or canoeing (Société Nautique Bisontine, 2nd club French).

===Sport events===
Grand Besançon Métropole is organizing from 2019 a festival called Grandes Heures Nature devoted to outdoor sports such as hiking, trail running, canoeing, climbing, mountain biking and road cycling. It takes place over four days during the month of June. The city of Besançon is a regular stage city in the [[Tour de France]] bicycle race, which it hosted 18 times between 1903 and 2018.

==Literary references==
* [[Julius Caesar]], in his account ''[[Commentarii de Bello Gallico]]'' gives a description of the antique city of Besançon, named Vesontio (first book, section 38):

<blockquote>[1.38] When he had proceeded three days' journey, word was brought to him that Ariovistus was hastening with all his forces to seize on Vesontio, which is the largest town of the Sequani, and had advanced three days' journey from its territories. Caesar thought that he ought to take the greatest precautions lest this should happen, for there was in that town a most ample supply of every thing which was serviceable for war; and so fortified was it by the nature of the ground, as to afford a great facility for protracting the war, inasmuch as the river Doubs almost surrounds the whole town, as though it were traced round it with a pair of compasses. A mountain of great height shuts in the remaining space, which is not more than {{convert|600|ft|m}}, where the river leaves a gap, in such a manner that the roots of that mountain extend to the river's bank on either side. A wall thrown around it makes a citadel of this [mountain], and connects it with the town.</blockquote>

* [[Gary Jennings (author)|Gary Jennings]]'s novel ''[[raptor (novel)|Raptor]]'', which takes place in the 5th century AD, describes Vesontio lavishly.
* In [[Stendhal]]'s novel ''[[Le rouge et le noir]]'', Julien Sorel, the main character, studies for a while at the Catholic [[seminary]] at Besançon (first book, chapters 24 to 30):

<blockquote>Eventually he saw the white walls beyond the distant mountain; it was the citadel of Besançon. "What a difference", he said, sighing, "if I could come into this fine city as a sub-lieutenant of one of these regiments of the post." Besançon is not only one of the prettiest cities in France, but it abounds in brave and intelligent men. Julien, however, was only a little peasant, without any means of approaching distinguished personages.</blockquote>

* In the poem "This Century Was Two Years Old" (''[[Les Feuilles d'automne]]''; literally – "The Leaves of Autumn"), [[Victor Hugo]] evokes his birth in Besançon:

<blockquote><poem>This century was two years old. Rome was replacing Sparta;
Already Napoleon was emerging from under Bonaparte.
And already the First Consul's tight mask
Had been split in several places by the Emperor's brow.
It was then that in Besançon, that old Spanish town,
Cast like a seed into the flying wind,
A child was born of mixed blood—Breton and Lorraine—
Pallid, blind and mute,...
That child, whom Life was scratching from its book,
And who had not another day to live,
Was me.</poem></blockquote>

* [[Julian Barnes]]'s novel ''A History of the World in {{frac|10|1|2}} Chapters'' features as chapter 3: "Wars of Religion"—a fictional manuscript reportedly from the Archives Municipales de Besançon.
* Balzac's novel ''Albert Savaron'' takes place in Besançon.
* Colonel Sainte-Hermine, the fictional hero of [[Alexandre Dumas]]' ''[[The Knight of Sainte-Hermine|The Last Cavalier]]'', is a native of Besançon.
The Christmas carol "Berger, Secoue Ton Sommeil Profond", known in English as "Shepherds, Shake Off Your Drowsy Sleep", originated in Besançon in the 17th century.
