It is one of the [[Mountain states]], sharing the [[Four Corners]] region with [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], and [[Utah]]. It is also bordered by [[Wyoming]] to the north, [[Nebraska]] to the northeast, [[Kansas]] to the east, and [[Oklahoma]] to the southeast. Colorado is noted for its landscape of [[mountains]], [[forests]], [[High Plains (United States)|high plains]], [[mesas]], [[canyons]], [[plateaus]], [[rivers]], and [[desert]] lands. It encompasses most of the [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], as well as the northeastern portion of the [[Colorado Plateau]] and the western edge of the [[Great Plains]]. Colorado is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|eighth most extensive]] and [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|21st most populous]] U.S. state. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimated the population of Colorado at 5,877,610 as of July 1, 2023, a 1.80% increase since the 2020 United States census.<ref name=Census>{{cite web|url=https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/tables/2020-2023/state/totals/NST-EST2023-POP.xlsx|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for the United States, Regions, States, District of Columbia and Puerto Rico: April 1, 2020 to July 1, 2022|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 10, 2023}}</ref>

The region has been inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] and their [[Paleo-Indians|ancestors]] for at least 13,500 years and possibly much longer. The eastern edge of the [[Rocky Mountains]] was a major migration route for early peoples who spread throughout the Americas. In 1848, much of the [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Nuevo México]] region was annexed to the United States with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. The [[Pike's Peak Gold Rush]] of 1858–1862 created an influx of settlers. On February 28, 1861, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[James Buchanan]] signed [[Colorado Organic Act|an act]] creating the [[Territory of Colorado]],<ref name=ColoradoOrganicAct/> and on August 1, 1876, President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] signed [[Colorado Statehood Proclamation|Proclamation 230]], admitting Colorado to the [[United States|Union]] as the 38th state.<ref name=ColoradoStatehoodProclamation/> The Spanish adjective ''"colorado"'' means "colored red" or "ruddy". Colorado is nicknamed the "[[List of U.S. state nicknames|Centennial State]]" because it became a state one century (and four weeks) after the signing of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].

[[Denver]] is the capital, the [[Colorado municipalities by population|most populous city]], and the center of the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]].

The [[Apache]] and the [[Comanche]] also inhabited the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the state. In the 17th century, the [[Arapaho Nation|Arapaho]] and [[Cheyenne Nation|Cheyenne]] moved west from the [[Great Lakes region]] to hunt across the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] of Colorado and [[Wyoming]].

The [[Spanish Empire]] claimed Colorado as part of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México|Nuevo México]]. The U.S. acquired the territorial claim to the eastern Rocky Mountains with the [[Louisiana Purchase]] from France in 1803. This U.S. claim conflicted with the claim by Spain to the upper [[Arkansas River|Arkansas River Basin]]. In 1806, [[Zebulon Pike]] led a [[Pike Expedition|U.S. Army reconnaissance expedition]] into the disputed region. Colonel Pike and his troops were arrested by Spanish cavalrymen in the [[San Luis Valley]] the following February, taken to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], and expelled from Mexico the following July.

The U.S. relinquished its claim to all land south and west of the [[Arkansas River]] and south of [[42nd parallel north]] and west of the [[100th meridian west]] as part of its purchase of Florida from Spain with the [[Adams-Onís Treaty]] of 1819. The treaty took effect on February 22, 1821. Having settled its border with Spain, the U.S. admitted the southeastern portion of the [[Missouri Territory|Territory of Missouri]] to the Union as the [[Missouri|state of Missouri]] on August 10, 1821. The remainder of Missouri Territory, including what would become northeastern Colorado, became an unorganized territory and remained so for 33 years over the [[Slavery in the United States|question of slavery]]. After 11 years of war, Spain finally recognized the independence of Mexico with the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] signed on August 24, 1821. Mexico eventually ratified the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1831. The [[Texian Revolt]] of 1835–36 fomented a dispute between the U.S. and Mexico which eventually erupted into the [[Mexican–American War]] in 1846. Mexico surrendered its northern territory to the U.S. with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] after the war in 1848; this included much of the western and southern areas of Colorado.

Well over half of Colorado was received from this treaty.]]

Most American settlers first traveled to Colorado through the [[Santa Fe Trail]], which connected the U.S. to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and the [[Camino Real de Tierra Adentro]] southward. Others were traveling overland west to the [[Oregon Country]], the new [[California gold rush|goldfields of California]], or the new [[Mormon]] settlements of the [[State of Deseret]] in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], avoided the rugged [[Southern Rocky Mountains]], and instead followed the [[North Platte River]] and [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] to [[South Pass (Wyoming)]], the lowest crossing of the [[Continental Divide]] between the Southern Rocky Mountains and the Central Rocky Mountains. In 1849, the Mormons of the Salt Lake Valley organized the extralegal [[State of Deseret]], claiming the entire [[Great Basin]] and all lands drained by the rivers [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green]], [[Colorado River|Grand]], and [[Colorado River|Colorado]]. The federal government of the U.S. flatly refused to recognize the new Mormon government because it was [[History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints#Brigham Young's early theocratic leadership|theocratic]] and [[Sanctions (law)|sanctioned]] [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriage]]. Instead, the [[Compromise of 1850]] divided the [[Mexican Cession]] and the northwestern claims of Texas into a new state and two new territories, the [[state of California]], the [[Territory of New Mexico]], and the [[Territory of Utah]]. On April 9, 1851, [[Hispanos of New Mexico|Hispano]] settlers from the area of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]] settled the village of [[San Luis, Colorado|San Luis]], then in the [[New Mexico Territory]], as Colorado's first permanent [[European American|Euro-American]] [[settlement (migration)|settlement]], further cementing the traditions of [[New Mexican cuisine]] and [[New Mexico music]] in the developing [[Southern Rocky Mountain Front]].<ref name="Lyons 2018">{{cite web | last=Lyons | first=Luke | title=Musical festival brings in top New Mexico, regional acts | website=Pueblo Chieftain | date=September 27, 2018 | url=https://www.chieftain.com/story/entertainment/local/2018/09/27/musical-festival-brings-in-top/9290899007/ | access-date=March 4, 2024}}</ref><ref name="Sexton 2019">{{cite web | last=Sexton | first=Josie | title=The Hatch and Pueblo chile feud is heating up.

In 1854, Senator [[Stephen A. Douglas]] persuaded the [[U.S. Congress]] to divide the unorganized territory east of the [[Continental Divide]] into two new organized territories, the [[Territory of Kansas]] and the [[Territory of Nebraska]], and an unorganized southern region known as the [[Indian Territory]]. Each new territory was to decide the fate of slavery within its boundaries, but this compromise merely served to fuel animosity between [[free soil]] and [[Proslavery in the antebellum United States|pro-slavery]] factions.

The gold seekers organized the [[Jefferson Territory|Provisional Government of the Territory of Jefferson]] on August 24, 1859, but this new territory failed to secure approval from the [[Congress of the United States]] embroiled in the debate over slavery. The election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] for the President of the United States on November 6, 1860, led to the [[secession]] of nine southern [[slave states]] and the threat of [[American Civil War|civil war among the states]]. Seeking to augment the political power of the [[free state (United States)|Union states]], the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]-dominated Congress quickly admitted the eastern portion of the [[Territory of Kansas]] into the [[United States|Union]] as the free [[Kansas|State of Kansas]] on January 29, 1861, leaving the western portion of the Kansas Territory, and its gold-mining areas, as unorganized territory.

Thirty days later on February 28, 1861, outgoing U.S. President [[James Buchanan]] signed an Act of Congress organizing the [[Free state (United States)|free]] [[Territory of Colorado]].<ref name=ColoradoOrganicAct/> The original boundaries of Colorado remain unchanged except for government survey amendments. In 1776, Spanish priest [[Silvestre Vélez de Escalante]] recorded that Native Americans in the area knew the river as ''[[:es:Rio Colorado|el Rio Colorado]]'' for the red-brown silt that the river carried from the mountains.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Multiple Property Documentation Form |title=National-Register-of-Historic |url=https://www.nps.gov/elca/learn/historyculture/upload/National-Register-of-Historic-Places-Multiple-Properties-508.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.nps.gov/elca/learn/historyculture/upload/National-Register-of-Historic-Places-Multiple-Properties-508.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |website=www.nps.gov}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=April 2021}} In 1859, a U.S. Army [[Topography|topographic]] expedition led by Captain [[John Navarre Macomb, Jr.|John Macomb]] located the confluence of the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] with the [[Grand River (Colorado)|Grand River]] in what is now [[Canyonlands National Park]] in [[Utah]].<ref name=Macomb>Report of the exploring expedition from Santa Fé, New Mexico, to the junction of the Grand and Green Rivers of the great Colorado of the West, in 1859: under the command of Capt.

Macomb, Corps of topographical engineers, Volume 1 [https://archive.org/stream/reportofexplorin00unitrich#page/n5/mode/2up @ archive.org]</ref> The Macomb party designated the confluence as the source of the Colorado River.

On April 12, 1861, [[South Carolina]] artillery opened fire on [[Fort Sumter]] to start the [[American Civil War]]. While many gold seekers held sympathies for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the vast majority remained fiercely loyal to the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] cause.

In 1862, a force of Texas cavalry invaded the [[Territory of New Mexico]] and captured [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] on March 10. The object of this [[New Mexico Campaign|Western Campaign]] was to seize or disrupt Colorado and California's gold fields and seize Pacific Ocean ports for the Confederacy. A hastily organized force of Colorado volunteers force-marched from [[Denver City, Colorado Territory]], to [[Glorieta Pass]], New Mexico Territory, in an attempt to block the Texans. On March 28, the Coloradans and local New Mexico volunteers stopped the Texans at the [[Battle of Glorieta Pass]], destroyed their cannon and supply wagons, and dispersed 500 of their horses and mules.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Blood & treasure : Confederate Empire in the Southwest|last=Frazier |first=Donald Shaw |date=1995|publisher=Texas A & M University Press|isbn=0585303304|edition=1st|location=College Station|oclc=45732362}}</ref> The Texans were forced to retreat to Santa Fe. Having lost the supplies for their campaign and finding little support in New Mexico, the Texans abandoned Santa Fe and returned to [[San Antonio]] in defeat. The Confederacy made no further attempts to seize the Southwestern United States.

In 1864, [[Governor of Colorado|Territorial Governor]] [[John Evans (Colorado governor)|John Evans]] appointed the Reverend [[John Chivington]] as Colonel of the Colorado Volunteers with orders to protect white settlers from [[Cheyenne]] and [[Arapaho]] warriors who were accused of stealing cattle. Colonel Chivington ordered his troops to attack a band of Cheyenne and Arapaho encamped along Sand Creek. Chivington reported that his troops killed more than 500 warriors. The militia returned to Denver City in triumph, but several officers reported that the so-called battle was a blatant massacre of Indians at peace, that most of the dead were women and children, and that the bodies of the dead had been hideously mutilated and desecrated. Three U.S. Army inquiries condemned the action, and incoming President [[Andrew Johnson]] asked Governor Evans for his resignation, but none of the perpetrators was ever punished. This event is now known as the [[Sand Creek massacre]].

In the midst and aftermath of the Civil War, many discouraged prospectors returned to their homes, but a few stayed and developed mines, mills, farms, ranches, roads, and towns in Colorado Territory. On September 14, 1864, James Huff discovered silver near [[Argentine Pass]], the first of many silver strikes. In 1867, the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] laid its tracks west to Weir, now [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]], in the northeast corner of the Territory. The Union Pacific linked up with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]] at [[Promontory Summit, Utah]], on May 10, 1869, to form the [[First transcontinental railroad]]. The [[Denver Pacific Railway]] reached Denver in June of the following year, and the [[Kansas Pacific]] arrived two months later to forge the second line across the continent. In 1872, rich veins of silver were discovered in the [[San Juan Mountains]] on the [[Ute tribe|Ute Indian]] reservation in southwestern Colorado. The Ute people were removed from the San Juan Mountains the following year.

The discovery of a major silver lode near [[Leadville, Colorado|Leadville]] in 1878 triggered the [[Colorado Silver Boom]]. The [[Sherman Silver Purchase Act]] of 1890 invigorated silver mining, and Colorado's last, but greatest, gold strike at [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] a few months later lured a new generation of gold seekers. Colorado women were granted the right to vote on November 7, 1893, making Colorado the second state to grant [[universal suffrage]] and the first one by a [[1893 Colorado women's suffrage referendum|popular vote]] (of Colorado men). The repeal of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act in 1893 led to a staggering collapse of the mining and agricultural economy of Colorado, but the state slowly and steadily recovered. Between the 1880s and 1930s, Denver's floriculture industry developed into a major industry in Colorado.<ref>Shu Liu and Linda M.

Colorado became the first western state to host a major political convention when the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] met in Denver in 1908. By the [[United States Census, 1930|U.S. census in 1930]], the population of Colorado first exceeded one million residents. Colorado suffered greatly through the [[Great Depression]] and the [[Dust Bowl]] of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following [[World War II]] boosted Colorado's fortune. Tourism became a mainstay of the state economy, and high technology became an important economic engine. The [[United States Census Bureau]] estimated that the population of Colorado exceeded five million in 2009.

Four warships of the [[U.S. Navy]] have been named the [[USS Colorado|USS ''Colorado'']]. The first USS ''Colorado'' was named for the Colorado River and served in the Civil War and later the [[Asiatic Squadron]], where it was attacked during the 1871 [[United States expedition to Korea|Korean Expedition]]. The later three ships were named in honor of the state, including [[USS Colorado (ACR-7)|an armored cruiser]] and the [[USS Colorado (BB-45)|battleship USS ''Colorado'']], the latter of which was the lead ship of [[Colorado-class battleship|her class]] and served in [[War in the Pacific|World War II in the Pacific]] beginning in 1941.

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Colorado}}
[[File:Colorado geographic map-en.svg|thumb]]

Colorado is notable for its diverse geography, which includes alpine mountains, high plains, deserts with huge sand dunes, and deep canyons. In 1861, the [[Thirty-sixth United States Congress|United States Congress]] defined the boundaries of the new [[Territory of Colorado]] exclusively by lines of [[latitude]] and [[longitude]], stretching from [[37th parallel north|37°N]] to [[41st parallel north|41°N]] latitude, and from [[25th meridian west from Washington|102°02′48″W]] to [[32nd meridian west from Washington|109°02′48″W]] longitude ([[25th meridian west from Washington|25°W]] to [[32nd meridian west from Washington|32°W]] from the [[Washington Meridian]]).<ref name="ColoradoOrganicAct">{{cite web|url=https://govtrackus.s3.amazonaws.com/legislink/pdf/stat/12/STATUTE-12-Pg172.pdf|title=An Act to provide a temporary Government for the Territory of Colorado|work=[[Congressional Record]]|publisher=[[Thirty-sixth United States Congress]]|date=February 28, 1861|pages=172–177|access-date=May 28, 2023}}</ref> After {{age|1861|02|28}} years of government surveys, the borders of Colorado were officially defined by 697 [[boundary marker]]s and 697 [[Border|straight boundary lines]].<ref name="FM">{{cite web|publisher=Fascinating Maps|title=Colorado is NOT a perfect rectangle|url=https://fascinatingmaps.com/colorado-is-not-a-perfect-rectangle/|access-date=November 15, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190617202941/https://fascinatingmaps.com/colorado-is-not-a-perfect-rectangle/|archive-date=June 17, 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> Colorado, [[Wyoming]], and [[Utah]] are the only states that have their borders defined solely by straight boundary lines with no natural features.<ref name="BT">{{cite web|publisher=The Big Think, Inc.|title=Colorado is a rectangle?

===Plains===
[[File:Picketwire Canyon.jpg|thumb|The arid high plains in Southeastern Colorado]]

Approximately half of Colorado is flat and rolling land.

Eastern Colorado is presently mainly farmland and rangeland, along with small farming villages and towns. [[Maize|Corn]], [[wheat]], [[hay]], [[soybean]]s, and [[oat]]s are all typical crops. Most villages and towns in this region boast both a water tower and a [[grain elevator]]. Irrigation water is available from both surface and subterranean sources. Surface water sources include the [[South Platte]], the [[Arkansas River]], and a few other streams. Subterranean water is generally accessed through [[artesian well]]s. Heavy usage of these wells for irrigation purposes caused underground water reserves to decline in the region. Eastern Colorado also hosts a considerable amount and range of livestock, such as cattle ranches and hog farms.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://coloradosun.com/2019/04/08/colorado-cattle-rustling-brand-inspectors/|title=Colorado cattle rustling's colorful history helps modern brand inspectors keep up with a changing crime|work=The Colorado Sun|access-date=March 27, 2021|last=Simpson|first=Kevin|date=April 8, 2019}}</ref>

===Front Range===
[[File:Condiv.JPG|thumb|[[Front Range]] Peaks west of Denver]]

Roughly 70% of Colorado's population resides along the eastern edge of the Rocky Mountains in the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]] between [[Cheyenne, Wyoming]], and [[Pueblo, Colorado]]. This region is partially protected from prevailing storms that blow in from the Pacific Ocean region by the high Rockies in the middle of Colorado. The "Front Range" includes Denver, [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]], Loveland, [[Castle Rock, Colorado|Castle Rock]], Colorado Springs, Pueblo, Greeley, and other townships and municipalities in between. On the other side of the Rockies, the significant population centers in western Colorado (which is known as "The Western Slope") are the cities of [[Grand Junction, Colorado|Grand Junction]], [[Durango, Colorado|Durango]], and [[Montrose, Colorado|Montrose]].

===Mountains===

To the west of the Great Plains of Colorado rises the eastern slope of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Notable peaks of the Rocky Mountains include [[Longs Peak]], [[Mount Blue Sky]], [[Pikes Peak]], and the [[Spanish Peaks]] near [[Walsenburg, Colorado|Walsenburg]], in southern Colorado. This area drains to the east and the southeast, ultimately either via the [[Mississippi River]] or the [[Rio Grande]] into the [[Gulf of Mexico]].

The Rocky Mountains within Colorado contain 53 true peaks and 58 named peaks<ref>{{Cite web |title=What are 14ers?

Above this tree line, only alpine vegetation grows. Only small parts of the Colorado Rockies are snow-covered year-round.

Much of the alpine snow melts by mid-August except for a few snow-capped peaks and a few small glaciers. The [[Colorado Mineral Belt]], stretching from the [[San Juan Mountains]] in the southwest to [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]] and [[Central City, Colorado|Central City]] on the front range, contains most of the historic gold- and silver-mining districts of Colorado. [[Mount Elbert]] is the highest summit of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The 30 [[Highest mountain peaks of the Rocky Mountains|highest major summits]] of the Rocky Mountains of North America are all within the state.

====Continental Divide====
[[File:Grays Peak, Colorado - 2007-06-17.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Grays Peak]], at {{convert|4352|m|order=flip}}, is the highest point on the [[Continental Divide of the Americas|Continental Divide]] in North America.]]

The [[Continental Divide of the Americas]] extends along the crest of the Rocky Mountains. The area of Colorado to the west of the Continental Divide is called the [[Colorado Western Slope|Western Slope of Colorado]]. West of the Continental Divide, water flows to the southwest via the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and the [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] towards the [[Gulf of California]].

Within the interior of the Rocky Mountains are several large parks which are high broad basins. In the north, on the east side of the Continental Divide is the [[North Park (Colorado basin)|North Park of Colorado]]. The North Park is drained by the [[North Platte River]], which flows north into Wyoming and Nebraska. Just to the south of North Park, but on the western side of the Continental Divide, is the [[Middle Park (Colorado basin)|Middle Park of Colorado]], which is drained by the Colorado River. The [[South Park (Park County, Colorado)|South Park of Colorado]] is the region of the [[headwater]]s of the South Platte River.

===South Central region===
[[File:ChicoClosedBasin.jpg|thumb|The high desert lands that make up the San Luis Valley in Southern Colorado]]

In south-central Colorado is the large [[San Luis Valley]], where the headwaters of the [[Rio Grande]] are located. The northern part of the valley is the [[San Luis Closed Basin]], an [[endorheic basin]] that helped created the [[Great Sand Dunes]]. The valley sits between the [[Sangre De Cristo Mountains]] and [[San Juan Mountains]]. The Rio Grande drains due south into New Mexico, Texas, and Mexico. Across the [[Sangre de Cristo Range]] to the east of the San Luis Valley lies the [[Wet Mountain Valley]]. These basins, particularly the San Luis Valley, lie along the [[Rio Grande Rift]], a major [[geological formation]] of the Rocky Mountains, and its branches.

===Western Slope===

[[File:Colorado National Monument (4939640266).jpg|thumb|The Colorado National Monument near Grand Junction is made up of high desert canyons and sandstone rock formations.]]

The Western Slope of Colorado includes the western face of the Rocky Mountains and all of the area to the western border. This area includes several terrains and climates from alpine mountains to arid deserts. The Western Slope includes many ski resort towns in the Rocky Mountains and towns west to Utah. It is less populous than the Front Range but includes a large number of national parks and monuments.

The northwestern corner of Colorado is a sparsely populated region, and it contains part of the noted [[Dinosaur National Monument]], which not only is a [[paleontology|paleontological]] area, but is also a scenic area of rocky hills, canyons, arid desert, and streambeds. Here, the Green River briefly crosses over into Colorado.

The Western Slope of Colorado is drained by the Colorado River and its tributaries (primarily the [[Gunnison River]], [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]], and the [[San Juan River (Colorado River)|San Juan River]]). The Colorado River flows through [[Glenwood Canyon]], and then through an arid valley made up of desert from [[Rifle, Colorado|Rifle]] to [[Parachute, Colorado|Parachute]], through the desert canyon of [[De Beque Canyon]], and into the arid desert of [[Grand Valley (Colorado-Utah)|Grand Valley]], where the city of Grand Junction is located.

Also prominent is the [[Grand Mesa]], which lies to the southeast of Grand Junction; the high San Juan Mountains, a rugged mountain range; and to the north and west of the San Juan Mountains, the [[Colorado Plateau]].

[[Grand Junction, Colorado]], at the confluence of the Colorado and Gunnison Rivers, is the largest city on the Western Slope. Grand Junction and Durango are the only major centers of [[television broadcasting]] west of the Continental Divide in Colorado, though most mountain resort communities publish daily newspapers. Grand Junction is located at the juncture of [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|Interstate 70]] and US 50, the only major highways in western Colorado. Grand Junction is also along the major railroad of the Western Slope, the [[Union Pacific]]. This railroad also provides the tracks for [[Amtrak]]'s ''[[California Zephyr]]'' passenger train, which crosses the Rocky Mountains between Denver and Grand Junction.

The Western Slope includes multiple notable destinations in the Colorado Rocky Mountains, including [[Glenwood Springs, Colorado|Glenwood Springs]], with its resort hot springs, and the [[ski resort]]s of [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]], [[Breckenridge, Colorado|Breckenridge]], [[Vail, Colorado|Vail]], [[Crested Butte, Colorado|Crested Butte]], [[Steamboat Springs, Colorado|Steamboat Springs]], and [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]].

Higher education in and near the Western Slope can be found at [[Colorado Mesa University]] in Grand Junction, [[Western Colorado University]] in Gunnison, [[Fort Lewis College]] in Durango, and [[Colorado Mountain College]] in Glenwood Springs and Steamboat Springs.

The [[Four Corners Monument]] in the southwest corner of Colorado marks the common boundary of Colorado, [[New Mexico]], [[Arizona]], and [[Utah]]; the only such place in the United States.

==Climate==
[[File:Köppen Climate Types Colorado.png|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Colorado, using 1991-2020 [[Climatological normal|climate normals]]]]

The [[climate]] of Colorado is more complex than states outside of the [[Mountain States]] region. Unlike most other states, southern Colorado is not always warmer than northern Colorado. Most of Colorado is made up of mountains, foothills, high plains, and desert lands. Mountains and surrounding valleys greatly affect the local climate.  Northeast, east, and southeast Colorado are mostly the high plains, while Northern Colorado is a mix of high plains, foothills, and mountains. Northwest and west Colorado are predominantly mountainous, with some desert lands mixed in. Southwest and southern Colorado are a complex mixture of desert and mountain areas.

===Eastern Plains===

The climate of the Eastern Plains is [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: [[Cold semi-arid climate|''BSk'']]) with low humidity and moderate precipitation, usually from {{convert|15|to|25|in|abbr=off|mm|sp=us}} annually, although many areas near the rivers are semi-humid climate. The area is known for its abundant sunshine and cool, clear nights, which give this area a great average [[diurnal temperature variation|diurnal temperature range]]. The difference between the highs of the days and the lows of the nights can be considerable as warmth dissipates to space during clear nights, the heat radiation not being trapped by clouds. The Front Range urban corridor, where most of the population of Colorado resides, lies in a pronounced [[rain shadow|precipitation shadow]] as a result of being on the [[Leeward|lee]] side of the Rocky Mountains.<ref name="usgsFRUC1978">{{cite report |last1=Hansen |first1=Wallace R. |last2=Chronic |first2=John |last3=Matelock |first3=John |date=1979|orig-year=first published 1978|title=Climatography of the Front Range Urban Corridor and vicinity, Colorado |work=Geological Survey Professional Paper 1019|publisher=USG Printing Office|place=Washington, DC |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1019/report.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://pubs.usgs.gov/pp/1019/report.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |access-date=March 21, 2016 }}</ref>

In summer, this area can have many days above 95&nbsp;°F (35&nbsp;°C) and often 100&nbsp;°F (38&nbsp;°C).<ref name="Climate of Colorado">{{cite web |url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm |title=Climate of Colorado |website=Wrcc.dri.edu |access-date=April 1, 2016 |archive-date=April 7, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407210955/http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/COLORADO.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> On the plains, the winter lows usually range from 25 to −10&nbsp;°F (−4 to −23&nbsp;°C). About 75% of the precipitation falls within the growing season, from April to September, but this area is very prone to droughts. Most of the precipitation comes from thunderstorms, which can be severe, and from major snowstorms that occur in the winter and early spring. Otherwise, winters tend to be mostly dry and cold.<ref name="Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America">{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=096427&refer=&cityname=Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America|title=Denver, Colorado Travel Weather Averages|publisher=Weatherbase |access-date=July 10, 2013}}</ref>

In much of the region, March is the snowiest month. April and May are normally the rainiest months, while April is the wettest month overall. The Front Range cities closer to the mountains tend to be warmer in the winter due to [[Chinook wind]]s which warms the area, sometimes bringing temperatures of 70&nbsp;°F (21&nbsp;°C) or higher in the winter.<ref name="Denver-Colorado-United-States-of-America" /> The average July temperature is 55&nbsp;°F (13&nbsp;°C) in the morning and 90&nbsp;°F (32&nbsp;°C) in the afternoon. The average January temperature is 18&nbsp;°F (−8&nbsp;°C) in the morning and 48&nbsp;°F (9&nbsp;°C) in the afternoon, although variation between consecutive days can be 40&nbsp;°F (22&nbsp;°C).

===Front Range foothills===

Just west of the plains and into the foothills, there is a wide variety of climate types. Locations merely a few miles apart can experience entirely different weather depending on the topography. Most valleys have a semi-arid climate, not unlike the eastern plains, which transitions to an [[alpine climate]] at the highest elevations. Microclimates also exist in local areas that run nearly the entire spectrum of climates, including subtropical highland (''Cfb/Cwb''), humid subtropical (''Cfa''), humid continental (''Dfa/Dfb''), Mediterranean (''Csa/Csb'') and subarctic (''Dfc'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |title=Relocating to Greenhorn Valley |access-date=February 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525090433/http://www.greenhornchamber.org/relocation.html |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Extreme weather===

Extreme weather changes are common in Colorado, although a significant portion of the extreme weather occurs in the least populated areas of the state. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental Divide in the spring and summer, yet are usually brief. Hail is a common sight in the mountains east of the Divide and across the eastern Plains, especially the northeast part of the state. Hail is the most commonly reported warm-season severe weather hazard, and occasionally causes human injuries, as well as significant property damage.<ref name="Childs">{{cite journal |last = Childs |first = Samuel J. |author2 = R.

The Eastern Plains are part of the extreme western portion of [[Tornado Alley]]; some damaging tornadoes in the Eastern Plains include the 1990 [[Limon, Colorado|Limon]] [[Fujita scale|F3]] tornado and the [[Tornado outbreak of May 22–27, 2008#Windsor, Colorado|2008 Windsor EF3 tornado]], which devastated a small town.<ref>{{cite web |last =Slater |first =Jane |title =Thursday's Tornado State's 4th Costliest Disaster |publisher =[[KMGH]] |date =May 28, 2008 |url =http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/16408116/detail.html |access-date =January 25, 2009 |archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080604044140/http://www.thedenverchannel.com/news/16408116/detail.html |archive-date =June 4, 2008 |url-status =dead |df =mdy-all }}</ref> Portions of the eastern Plains see especially frequent tornadoes, both those spawned from [[mesocyclone]]s in [[supercell]] thunderstorms and from less intense [[landspout]]s, such as within the [[Denver convergence vorticity zone]] (DCVZ).<ref name="Childs"/>

The Plains are also susceptible to occasional floods and particularly severe flash floods, which are caused both by thunderstorms and by the rapid melting of snow in the mountains during warm weather. Notable examples include the [[1965 Denver Flood]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.westword.com/news/the-1965-flood-how-denvers-greatest-disaster-changed-the-city-6668119|title=The 1965 Flood: How Denver's Greatest Disaster Changed the City|first=Alan|last=Prendergast|date=April 29, 2015}}</ref> the [[Big Thompson River]] flooding of 1976 and the [[2013 Colorado floods]]. Hot weather is common during summers in Denver. The city's record in 1901 for the number of consecutive days above 90&nbsp;°F (32&nbsp;°C) was broken during the summer of 2008. The new record of 24 consecutive days surpassed the previous record by almost a week.<ref>{{cite web | title =Denver's Consecutive 90 Degree Streaks | publisher =[[National Weather Service]] | access-date =October 10, 2009 | url =http://www.crh.noaa.gov/bou/?n=consec90}}</ref>

Much of Colorado is very dry, with the state averaging only {{convert|17|in|mm|abbr=off|sp=us}} of precipitation per year statewide. The state rarely experiences a time when some portion is not in some degree of drought.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/pdfs/ahistoryofdrought.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://ccc.atmos.colostate.edu/pdfs/ahistoryofdrought.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|title=A History of Drought|access-date=July 30, 2010}}</ref> The lack of precipitation contributes to the severity of wildfires in the state, such as the [[Hayman Fire]] of 2002. Other notable fires include the [[Fourmile Canyon#Fourmile Canyon Fire|Fourmile Canyon Fire]] of 2010, the [[Waldo Canyon Fire]] and [[High Park Fire]] of June 2012, and the [[Black Forest Fire]] of June 2013. Even these fires were exceeded in severity by the [[Pine Gulch Fire]], [[Cameron Peak Fire]], and [[East Troublesome Fire]] in 2020, all being the three largest fires in Colorado history (see [[2020 Colorado wildfires]]). And the Marshall Fire which started on December 30, 2021, while not the largest in state history, was the most destructive ever in terms of property loss (see [[Marshall Fire]]).

However, some of the mountainous regions of Colorado receive a huge amount of moisture from winter snowfalls. The spring melts of these snows often cause great waterflows in the [[Yampa River]], the [[Colorado River]], the Rio Grande, the Arkansas River, the North Platte River, and the South Platte River.

Water flowing out of the Colorado Rocky Mountains is a very significant source of water for the farms, towns, and cities of the southwest states of New Mexico, Arizona, Utah, and Nevada, as well as the Midwest, such as Nebraska and Kansas, and the southern states of Oklahoma and Texas. A significant amount of water is also diverted for use in California; occasionally (formerly naturally and consistently), the flow of water reaches northern Mexico.

While there is fossil evidence of [[Harrington's mountain goat]] in Colorado between at least 800,000 years ago and its extinction with [[megafauna]] roughly 11,000 years ago, the [[mountain goat]] is not native to Colorado but was instead introduced to the state over time during the interval between 1947 and 1972.

The native population of [[pronghorn]] in Colorado has varied wildly over the last century, reaching a low of only 15,000 individuals during the 1960s. However, conservation efforts succeeded in bringing the stable population back up to roughly 66,000 by 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gohunt.com/read/antelope-numbers-across-6-states#gs.x2odjd|title=Antelope Numbers Across 6 States|work=GoHunt|access-date=March 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312113526/https://www.gohunt.com/read/antelope-numbers-across-6-states|archive-date=March 12, 2016}}</ref> The population was estimated to have reached 85,000 by 2019 and had increasingly more run-ins with the increased suburban housing along the eastern Front Range.

Like the federal government and all other U.S. states, Colorado's [[Constitution of the State of Colorado|state constitution]] provides for three branches of government: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial branches.

The [[Governor of Colorado]] heads the state's executive branch. The current governor is [[Jared Polis]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. Colorado's other statewide elected executive officers are the [[Lieutenant Governor of Colorado]] (elected on a [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with the Governor), [[Secretary of State of Colorado]], [[Colorado State Treasurer]], and [[Attorney General of Colorado]], all of whom serve four-year terms.

The seven-member [[Colorado Supreme Court]] is the state's highest court. The [[Colorado Court of Appeals]], with 22 judges, sits in divisions of three judges each. Colorado is divided into 22 judicial districts, each of which has a district court and a county court with limited jurisdiction. The state also has [[Colorado water courts|specialized water courts]], which sit in seven distinct divisions around the state and which decide matters relating to water rights and the use and administration of water.

The state legislative body is the [[Colorado General Assembly]], which is made up of two houses – the [[Colorado House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[Colorado Senate|Senate]]. The House has 65 members and the Senate has 35. {{as of|2023}}, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] holds a 23 to 12 majority in the Senate and a 46 to 19 majority in the House.

Most Coloradans are native to other states (nearly 60% according to the 2000 census),<ref>{{cite web

Tax is collected by the [[Colorado Department of Revenue]].

Colorado was once considered a [[swing state]], but has become a relatively safe [[Red states and blue states|blue state]] in both state and federal elections. In presidential elections, it had not been won until [[2020 United States presidential election in Colorado|2020]] by double digits since [[1984 United States presidential election in Colorado|1984]] and has backed the winning candidate in 9 of the last 11 elections. Coloradans have elected 17 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] and 12 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] to the governorship in the last 100 years.

In presidential politics, Colorado was considered a reliably Republican state during the post-World War II era, voting for the Democratic candidate only in 1948, 1964, and 1992. However, it became a competitive swing state in the 1990s. Since the mid-2000s, it has swung heavily to the Democrats, voting for [[Barack Obama]] in 2008 and 2012, [[Hillary Clinton]] in 2016, and [[Joe Biden]] in 2020.

Colorado politics exhibits a contrast between conservative cities such as Colorado Springs and Grand Junction, and liberal cities such as Boulder and Denver. Democrats are strongest in [[Denver Metropolitan Area|metropolitan Denver]], the college towns of [[Fort Collins, Colorado|Fort Collins]] and [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], southern Colorado (including Pueblo), and several western ski resort counties. The Republicans are strongest in the Eastern Plains, Colorado Springs, Greeley, and far Western Colorado near Grand Junction.

Colorado is represented by two members of the [[United States Senate]]:
* [[Classes of United States Senators#Class 2|Class 2]], [[John Hickenlooper]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]), since 2021
* [[Classes of United States Senators#Class 3|Class 3]], [[Michael Bennet]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]), since 2009

Colorado is represented by eight members of the [[United States House of Representatives]]:
* [[Colorado's 1st congressional district|1st district]]: [[Diana DeGette]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]), since 1997
* [[Colorado's 2nd congressional district|2nd district]]: [[Joe Neguse]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]), since 2019
* [[Colorado's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]]: [[Lauren Boebert]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]), since 2021
* [[Colorado's 4th congressional district|4th district]]: [[Greg Lopez]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]), since 2024
* [[Colorado's 5th congressional district|5th district]]: [[Doug Lamborn]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]), since 2007
* [[Colorado's 6th congressional district|6th district]]: [[Jason Crow]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]), since 2019
* [[Colorado's 7th congressional district|7th district]]: [[Brittany Pettersen]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]), since 2023
* [[Colorado's 8th congressional district|8th district]]: [[Yadira Caraveo]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]), since 2023

In a 2020 study, Colorado was ranked as the seventh easiest state for citizens to vote in.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=J.

====Significant initiatives and legislation enacted in Colorado====
Colorado was the first state in the union to enact, by voter referendum, [[1893 Colorado women's suffrage referendum|a law extending]] [[suffrage]] to women. That initiative was approved by the state's voters on November 7, 1893.<ref>{{cite news|date=August 19, 1893|title=Notice of General Election|volume=4|agency=Silverton Standard|issue=41|url=https://www.coloradohistoricnewspapers.org/cgi-bin/colorado?a=d&d=TSS18930819.2.61&srpos=1&dliv=none&e=19-08-1893-19-08-1893--en-20-TSS-1--txt-txIN-election-------0-|access-date=November 28, 2020}}</ref>

On the November 8, 1932, ballot, Colorado approved the [[Repeal of Prohibition|repeal of alcohol prohibition]] more than a year before the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] was ratified.

Colorado has banned, via C.R.S. section 12-6-302, the sale of motor vehicles on Sunday since at least 1953.<ref>{{cite web |title=Colorado Revised Statutes 2017 |url=https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/crs2017-title-12.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/images/olls/crs2017-title-12.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |website=Colorado General Assembly |publisher=State of Colorado |access-date=November 30, 2020}}</ref>

In 1972 Colorado voters rejected a [[1972 Denver Winter Olympics referendum|referendum proposal]] to fund the [[1976 Winter Olympics]], which had been scheduled to be held in the state. Denver had been chosen by the [[International Olympic Committee]] as the host city on May 12, 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1012stone.shtml |title=Colorado only state ever to turn down Olympics |date=October 12, 1999 |last=Sanko |first=John |work=[[Rocky Mountain News]] |access-date=November 28, 2020 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601181029/http://denver.rockymountainnews.com/millennium/1012stone.shtml |archive-date=June 1, 2009 }}</ref>

In 1992, by a margin of 53 to 47 percent, Colorado voters approved an amendment to the state constitution (Amendment 2) that would have prevented any city, town, or county in the state from taking any legislative, executive or judicial action to recognize homosexuals or bisexuals as a [[protected class]].<ref>{{cite journal | url=http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1986&context=bclr | title =Colorado's Amendment 2 and Homosexuals' Right to Equal Protection of the Law |last1= Zamansky |first1= Stephen |journal= [[Boston College Law Review]] |volume= 35 |issue= 1 |pages= 221–258 |date= December 1993}}</ref> In 1996, in a 6–3 ruling in ''[[Romer v.

Evans|volume=517|page=620|pin=|year=1996 }}.</ref>

In 2006, voters passed [[2006 Colorado Amendment 43|Amendment 43]], which banned gay marriage in Colorado.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Simpson |first1=Kevin |title=Colorado Amendment 43: Gay marriage banned; domestic partnerships also defeated |url=https://www.denverpost.com/2006/11/08/colorado-amendment-43-gay-marriage-banned-domestic-partnerships-also-defeated/ |access-date=November 28, 2020 |agency=The Denver Post|location=[[Denver]]|date=November 8, 2006 }}</ref> That initiative was nullified by the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]]'s 2015 decision in ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]''.

In 2012, voters amended the state constitution protecting the "personal use" of marijuana for adults, establishing a framework to regulate [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] like [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]]. The first recreational marijuana shops in Colorado, and by extension the United States, opened their doors on January 1, 2014.<ref name="Healy" />

On 30 October 2019, Colorado became the first state to accept digital ID via its myColorado app.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://appitventures.com/success-stories/mycolorado |title=How we built the State of Colorado, myColorado™ app. |publisher=appitventures.com |access-date=May 13, 2024}}</ref> The state-issued digital identifications will be considered valid when Real ID enforcement begins in 2025, in line with the [[Real ID Act|Real ID Act of 2005]].

===Special districts===
Colorado has more than 4,000 [[Special district (United States)|special districts]], most with [[property tax]] authority. These districts may provide schools, law enforcement, fire protection, water, sewage, drainage, irrigation, transportation, recreation, infrastructure, cultural facilities, business support, redevelopment, or other services.

[[File:RTD No. 4018 A Line train, USTH.jpg|thumb|A [[Regional Transportation District]] A Line train at [[Denver Union Station]].]]
Some of these districts have the authority to levy sales tax as well as property tax and use fees. This has led to a hodgepodge of sales tax and property tax rates in Colorado. There are some street intersections in Colorado with a different sales tax rate on each corner, sometimes substantially different.

Some of the more notable Colorado districts are:
* The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD), which affects the counties of Denver, Boulder, Jefferson, and portions of Adams, Arapahoe, Broomfield, and Douglas Counties
[[File:Denver Museum of Nature and Science View from north west.jpg|thumb|The [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]], one the many organizations funded by the [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]].]]
* The [[Scientific and Cultural Facilities District]] (SCFD), a special regional tax district with physical boundaries contiguous with county boundaries of Adams, Arapahoe, Boulder, Broomfield, Denver, Douglas, and Jefferson Counties
** It is a 0.1% retail sales and uses tax (one penny on every $10).
** According to the Colorado statute, the SCFD distributes the money to local organizations on an annual basis. These organizations must provide for the enlightenment and entertainment of the public through the production, presentation, exhibition, advancement, or preservation of art, music, theater, dance, zoology, botany, natural history, or cultural history.
** As directed by statute, SCFD recipient organizations are currently divided into three "tiers" among which receipts are allocated by percentage.
*** Tier I includes regional organizations: the [[Denver Art Museum]], the [[Denver Botanic Gardens]], the [[Denver Museum of Nature and Science]], the [[Denver Zoo]], and the [[Denver Center for the Performing Arts]]. It receives 65.5%.
*** Tier II currently includes 26 regional organizations. Tier II receives 21%.
*** Tier III has more than 280 local organizations such as small theaters, orchestras, art centers, natural history, cultural history, and community groups. Tier III organizations apply for funding from the county cultural councils via a grant process. This tier receives 13.5%.
** An 11-member board of directors oversees the distributions by the Colorado Revised Statutes. Seven board members are appointed by county commissioners (in Denver, the Denver City Council) and four members are appointed by the Governor of Colorado.
* The Football Stadium District (FD or FTBL), approved by the voters to pay for and help build the [[Denver Broncos]]' stadium [[Empower Field at Mile High]].
* Local Improvement Districts (LID) within designated areas of Jefferson and Broomfield counties.
* The Metropolitan Major League Baseball Stadium District, approved by voters to pay for and help build the [[Colorado Rockies]]' stadium [[Coors Field]].
* Regional Transportation Authority (RTA) taxes at varying rates in Basalt, Carbondale, Glenwood Springs, and Gunnison County.

Colorado has a high proportion of [[Hispanic]], mostly [[Mexican-American]], citizens in Metropolitan Denver, Colorado Springs, as well as the smaller cities of Greeley and Pueblo, and elsewhere. Southern, Southwestern, and Southeastern Colorado have a large number of Hispanos, the descendants of the early settlers of colonial Spanish origin. In 1940, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Colorado's population as 8.2% Hispanic and 90.3% non-Hispanic White.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals By Race, 1790 to 1990, and By Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, For The United States, Regions, Divisions, and States |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |access-date=January 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archive-date=December 24, 2014 }}</ref> The Hispanic population of Colorado has continued to grow quickly over the past decades.

Colorado also has some large African-American communities located in Denver, in the neighborhoods of Montbello, Five Points, Whittier, and many other East Denver areas. The state has sizable numbers of Asian-Americans of [[Mongolian American|Mongolian]], [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Filipino American|Filipino]], [[Korean American|Korean]], [[Southeast Asian]], and [[Japanese American|Japanese]] descent. The highest population of Asian Americans can be found on the south and southeast side of Denver, as well as some on Denver's southwest side. The Denver metropolitan area is considered more liberal and diverse than much of the state when it comes to political issues and environmental concerns.

The population of Native Americans in the state is small. Native Americans are concentrated in metropolitan Denver and the southwestern corner of Colorado, where there are two Ute reservations.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia| title=Native Americans, Pioneers, Settlers |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica | date=26 October 1998 | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Colorado-state/People}}</ref>

There were a total of 70,331 births in Colorado in 2006. (Birth rate of 14.6 per thousand.) In 2007, non-Hispanic Whites were involved in 59.1% of all births.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr57/nvsr57_12.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr57/nvsr57_12.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=National Vital Statistics Reports, Volume 57, Number 12, (March 18, 2009)|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |access-date=July 30, 2010}}</ref> Some 14.06% of those births involved a non-Hispanic White person and someone of a different race, most often with a couple including one Hispanic.

Per the 2000 census, the Hispanic population is estimated to be 918,899, or approximately 20% of the state's total population. Colorado has the 5th-largest population of Mexican-Americans, behind California, Texas, Arizona, and [[Illinois]].

In 2011, 46% of Colorado's population younger than the age of one were minorities, meaning that they had at least one parent who was not non-Hispanic White.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adworks.org/pdf/LosingGround_e-book.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.adworks.org/pdf/LosingGround_e-book.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=Losing ground |website=Adworks.org |access-date=April 1, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/datacentral/index.ssf/2012/06/americas_under_age_1_populatio.html|title=Americans under age 1 now mostly minorities, but not in Ohio: Statistical Snapshot|last=Exner|first=Rich|date=June 3, 2012|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]}}</ref>

[[Uranium mining in Colorado]] goes back to 1872, when pitchblende ore was taken from gold mines near Central City, Colorado. Not counting byproduct uranium from [[phosphate]], Colorado is considered to have the third-largest uranium reserves of any U.S. state, behind Wyoming and New Mexico. When Colorado and Utah dominated [[radium]] mining from 1910 to 1922, uranium and [[vanadium]] were the byproducts (giving towns like present-day [[Superfund site]] [[Uravan, Colorado|Uravan]] their names).<ref>Robert J.

Everhart (1960) Uranium, in Mineral Resources of Colorado First Sequel, State of Colorado Mineral Resources Board, pp. 330–331.</ref> Uranium price increases from 2001 to 2007 prompted several companies to revive uranium mining in Colorado. During the 1940s certain communities–including [[Naturita, Colorado|Naturita]] and [[Paradox, Colorado|Paradox]]–earned the moniker of "[[yellowcake]] towns" from their relationship with uranium mining. Price drops and financing problems in late 2008 forced these companies to cancel or scale back the uranium-mining project.

==Transportation==

{{Main|Transportation in Colorado}}
[[File:"Welcome to Colorful Colorado" state welcome sign along Interstate 70, entering from Utah (2006).jpg|thumb|left|A Colorado state welcome sign]]

Colorado's primary mode of transportation (in terms of passengers) is its highway system. [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|Interstate&nbsp;25]] (I-25) is the primary north–south highway in the state, connecting Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Denver, and Fort Collins, and extending north to Wyoming and south to New Mexico. [[Interstate 70 in Colorado|I-70]] is the primary east–west corridor. It connects Grand Junction and the mountain communities with Denver and enters Utah and Kansas. The state is home to a network of US and Colorado highways that provide access to all principal areas of the state. Many smaller communities are connected to this network only via county roads.
[[File:DIA.jpg|thumb|right|The main terminal of Denver International Airport evokes the peaks of the [[Front Range]].]]

[[Denver International Airport]] (DIA) is the third-busiest domestic U.S. and [[World's busiest airports by passenger traffic|international airport in the world by passenger traffic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://aci.aero/2022/04/11/the-top-10-busiest-airports-in-the-world-revealed/ |title=The top 10 busiest airports in the world revealed|publisher=[[Airports Council International]]|access-date=20 April 2022|date=11 April 2022}}</ref> DIA handles by far the largest volume of commercial air traffic in Colorado and is the busiest U.S. hub airport between Chicago and the Pacific coast, making Denver the most important airport for connecting passenger traffic in the western United States.

Public transportation bus services are offered both intra-city and inter-city—including the Denver metro area's RTD services. The [[Regional Transportation District]] (RTD) operates the popular [[RTD Bus & Rail]] transit system in the [[Denver Metropolitan Area]]. {{as of|2013|January|}} the RTD rail system had 170 light-rail vehicles, serving {{convert|47|mi|km}} of track. In addition to local public transit, intercity bus service is provided by [[Burlington Trailways]], [[Bustang]], [[Express Arrow]], and [[Greyhound Lines]].

[[File:California Zephyr--Eastbound meets Westbound in Glenwood Canyon.jpg|thumb|The westbound and eastbound ''[[California Zephyr]]s'' meet in the [[Glenwood Canyon]].]]

[[Amtrak]] operates two passenger rail lines in Colorado, the ''[[California Zephyr]]'' and ''[[Southwest Chief]]''. Colorado's contribution to world railroad history was forged principally by the [[Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad]] which began in 1870 and wrote the book on mountain railroading. In 1988 the "Rio Grande" was acquired, but was merged into, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] by their joint owner [[Philip Anschutz]]. On September 11, 1996, Anschutz sold the combined company to the [[Union Pacific Railroad]], creating the largest railroad network in the United States. The Anschutz sale was partly in response to the earlier merger of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe which formed the large Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railway (BNSF), Union Pacific's principal competitor in western U.S. railroading. Both Union Pacific and BNSF have extensive freight operations in Colorado.

Colorado's freight railroad network consists of 2,688 miles of Class I trackage. It is integral to the U.S. economy, being a critical artery for the movement of energy, agriculture, mining, and industrial commodities as well as general freight and manufactured products between the East and Midwest and the Pacific coast states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |title=Railroads and States |publisher=Aar.org |access-date=July 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130606044205/https://www.aar.org/keyissues/Pages/Railroads-And-States.aspx |archive-date=June 6, 2013 }}</ref>

The first institution of [[Higher education in the United States|higher education]] in the Colorado Territory was the [[Colorado Seminary]], opened on November 16, 1864, by the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]]. The seminary closed in 1867 but reopened in 1880 as the [[University of Denver]]. In 1870, the Bishop [[George M.

Following a 1950 assessment by the Service Academy Board, it was determined that there was a need to supplement the [[U.S. Military Academy|U.S. Military]] and [[U.S. Naval Academy|Naval Academies]] with a third school that would provide commissioned officers for the newly independent Air Force. On April 1, 1954, President [[Dwight Eisenhower]] signed a law that moved for the creation of a [[U.S. Air Force Academy]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9G8pAAAAIBAJ&pg=6899%2C3318710|newspaper=Spokesman-Review |location=(Spokane, Washington)|agency=Associated Press|title=Air Force Academy Act signed by Eisenhower|date=April 2, 1954 |page=1|access-date=March 25, 2021}}</ref> Later that year, Colorado Springs was selected to host the new institution.
