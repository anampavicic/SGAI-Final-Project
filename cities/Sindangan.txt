'''Sindangan''', officially the '''Municipality of Sindangan''' ({{langx|ceb|Lungsod sa Sindangan}}; [[Subanon language|Subanen]]: ''Benwa Sindangan''; [[Chavacano]]: ''Municipalidad de Sindangan''; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Sindangan}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 103,952 people.{{PH census|current}}

With increasing investor interests, improved infrastructures, and rapid population growth over the last decade, Sindangan is the fastest-growing municipality in the province of [[Zamboanga del Norte]]. It is also the second most populous locality after the provincial capital, Dipolog, and is the biggest and the most populous municipality in the entire [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] region, followed by the municipalities of [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]] in Zamboanga Sibugay, and [[Molave, Zamboanga del Sur|Molave]] in Zamboanga del Sur.

Due to its rapid demographic and economic growth, steps are being taken to convert the status of Sindangan from a municipality to a city in the next coming years. Once approved and ratified, Sindangan will be the third city in [[Zamboanga del Norte]], following the cities of [[Dipolog]] and [[Dapitan]].

==Etymology==
As to how Sindangan got its name, several stories have been told.

The first version narrates that a native fisherman carrying a basket full of fish was on his way home met a Guardia Civil, military guards during the Spanish regime, who asked this question, "''Cuál es el nombre de este lugar, amigo?''" ({{langx|en|What is the name of this place, friend?}}) And the [[Subanon people|Subanon]] fisherman who did not understand the Spanish language answered '''"''Indangan''"''', believing he asked on the kind of fish he caught. The stranger heard this as '''''"Sindangan"''''', thinking that was the exact answer to his inquiry to the fisherman about the name of the fish. From then on, the natives used Sindangan to name the place until it became into a municipality in 1936.<ref name="auto">{{Cite web |title=About Sindangan – Search Sindangan |url=https://sindangan.net/sindangan-zanorte-business-directory-page/ |access-date=2022-07-14 |language=en-US}}</ref>

The town appeared in the 1734 [[Murillo Velarde map]] which was originally spelled as '''''Sindãgan'''''.

== History ==
{{stack|float=right|[[File:President Manuel Quezon of Philippine Commonwealth broadcast from Washington today to his fellow-countrymen in Manila.jpg|thumb|President Quezon declared the charter day of Sindangan]]}}

=== Pre-Spanish Era ===
This town sets back its origin during the pre-[[Spanish colonization]] of the Philippines. [[Subanon people]] or tribe was its first inhabitants. The Subanens, a nomadic tribe of Indo-Malayan stock, were the earliest known settlers who lived along river banks or "suba", from which word they received their present tribal identity as Subanen. They built houses and sanctuaries for their shelter and formed their own 'government' ruled by the [[Datu]].

Over the years the [[Moros]] settled also in this place and preached Islam.

=== Spanish Era ''(As a Municipal District)'' ===
During the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] reign in the archipelago where towns had already been established, Sindangan was a barrio under the jurisdiction of the then municipality of [[Dapitan]] as early as 1598 to 1729, and slowly people from the [[Visayas]] islands flocked to [[Mindanao]] to find greener pasture. [[Christianity]] also propagated on this area through the effort of the Catholic missionaries like the [[Society of Jesus]] or the Jesuits, the [[Augustinians]], and the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]]s. One of its great missionaries was Padre [[Francesco Palliola]], a Jesuit missionary from [[Nola]], [[Italy]] who tirelessly preached the Christian message, perform baptisms and sacraments and helped the tribal people in this area of [[Zamboanga Peninsula]]. He was assigned in Dapitan and [[Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte|Katipunan]], and met his martyrdom in the barrio of Ponot (now [[Jose Dalman, Zamboanga del Norte|Jose Dalman]]) where he was killed by the Subanen people through the leadership of their chieftain. Later on, the barrio of Sindangan was transferred under the newly established town of Lubungan (now [[Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte|Katipunan]], who also was then a barrio of Dapitan) since the 19th century, unconnected by road.

=== Commonwealth Era ''(As a separate Municipality)'' ===
[[File:Sindangan Quezon Ave.jpg|left|thumb|A portion of the downtown area along Quezon Avenue in 1961 ''(left)'' and in 2022 ''(right)'']]
On December 23, 1936, Sindangan was separated from the municipality of [[Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte|Katipunan]] and became an independent municipality by virtue of Executive Order No. 77 issued by President of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]], [[Manuel L. Quezon]]. The municipalities of Sindangan, Siocon, Margosatubig, Pagadian, and Kabasalan were created out of the municipal districts of Sindangan, Panganuran, Labangan, Dinas, Sibuko, Sirawai, Margosatubig, Malangas, Kabasalan and Bangaan. The '''Municipality of Sindangan''' covered the area of Sindangan and Panganuran.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1936/12/23/executive-order-no-77-s-1936/|title=Executive Order No. 77, s. 1936 &#124; GOVPH|website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines}}</ref>

Bartolome Lira Sr. was appointed to organize the Municipality of Sindangan and was its first Municipal President. As his appointive tenure expired, he was elected as the first Municipal Mayor of Sindangan until 1941.

In 1955, four barrios of were created:
* '''Dicoyong''' - sitios of Labakid, Layawan, Morob, Gusani, Domalogdog, Maoal, Nato, Diongan, Makasing, Dipolo and Dicoyong Proper;
* '''Bacungan''' - sitios of Palandok, Rison, Bogabongan, Manil, Gusao, Talinga and Bacungan Proper;
* '''Lagag''' - sitios of Milaub, Mangalop, Gopit, Pase, Lipaga, Mianib, Siayan, Litolit, Balok, and Lagag Proper; and Bitoon - sitios of Misok, Hagonoy, Lico, Guban, Makinong, and Bitoon Proper
*'''Binuangan''' - sitios of Taguicon, Upper Binuangan, and Gusapong Proper<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1313-converting-certain-sitios-in-zamboanga-del-norte-as-barrios.html|title=R.A.

In 1959, the sitios of Gonayen, Gowayan, Domogok, Dinoyak, Mangilay, Pange, Balak, Laclac, Siriac, Macasing and Diongan were constituted into the barrio of '''Gonayen'''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra2110.html|title=R.A.

[[File:Sindangan Administrative History.jpg|left|thumb|Sindangan's political territory in 1936 (left) and in the present (right) in comparison with Zamboanga City]]
At the time of its creation as an independent municipality, Sindangan had the biggest territory in terms of land area in the then [[Zamboanga (province)|Province of Zamboanga]] (now the administrative region [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] with three separate provinces). It once comprised the current municipalities of Sindangan, [[Siayan, Zamboanga del Norte|Siayan]], [[Leon B. Postigo]], [[Salug]], [[Godod]], [[Liloy]], [[Tampilisan]], [[Labason]], [[Gutalac]], and [[Kalawit]]. With these measurements as evidenced, Sindangan was deemed to be bigger than the present land area of [[Zamboanga City]] before its division.

It was during the [[History of the Philippines (1946–1965)|Third Philippine Republic]] when Sindangan subsequently lost huge portions of its territories after the creation of its offspring municipalities, namely: [[Labason]] (1947),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1947/08/12/executive-order-no-79/ |title=Executive Order No. 79, s. 1947 |date=August 12, 1947 |website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)]] |publisher=[[Government of the Philippines]] |access-date=March 19, 2023}}</ref> [[Liloy]] (1951),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1951/08/22/executive-order-no-469-s-1951/ |title=Executive Order No. 469, s. 1951 |date=August 22, 1951 |website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)]] |publisher=[[Government of the Philippines]] |access-date=March 19, 2023}}</ref> [[Siayan, Zamboanga del Norte|Siayan]] (1967),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1967/ra_4989_1967.html |title=Republic Act No. 4989 |date=June 17, 1967 |website=The Lawphil Project |publisher=Arellano Law Foundation |access-date=March 8, 2024}}</ref> and [[Leon B. Postigo]] (established as Bacungan, 1982).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/14078 |title=Batas Pambansa Blg. 204 |date=March 25, 1982 |website=Supreme Court E-Library |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] |access-date=March 6, 2024}}
* {{cite web |url=https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/7091 |title=Republic Act No. 6830  |date=December 30, 1989 |website=Supreme Court E-Library |publisher=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines]] |access-date=March 6, 2024}}</ref> These aforementioned new municipalities also went reductions of their territories later in the years in light of the creation of newer municipalities, making Sindangan their mother and grandmother town.

Since its elevation to a municipality in 1936, people from [[Luzon]] and the [[Visayas]] continued migrating to Sindangan to settle together with their families and built businesses. That is why aside from the Subanens, there are Sindanganons whose origins are from Bohol, Cebu, Samar, Leyte, Negros, Bicol, Pampanga, and Manila.

=== World War II ===
When the Japanese forces invaded parts of Zamboanga Peninsula during the second world war, Sindangan was fortunately spared from the air bombings and battles happening in the Mindanao Island at the time. Nonetheless, Sindangan shared a piece of [[World War II]] history when the [[SS Shinyō Maru]] sank in the waters of Sindangan Bay with hundreds of [[Prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] on board the Japanese hell ship.

With approximately 750 Filipino and American prisoners of war (POW) on board, the vessel departed from its POW camp in Davao for Manila with stopover point in Zamboanga City. She departed Zamboanga the next day via Cebu in a convoy of large freighters, tankers, and torpedo boats to protect her against American destroyers. Meanwhile, an allied intelligence intercepted the Japanese Navy radio signals about ''Shinyō Maru’s'' movements which prompted the US Navy to send the submarine [[USS Paddle|USS ''Paddle'']] in a mission to intercept the convoy and sink her. With its movement now determined, the US submarine had waited for hours for the hell ship to pass by, two miles off coast from Sindangan point. 

Upon reaching the waters of Sindangan Bay, ''Shinyō Maru'' was seen to be leading the convoy. ''Paddle'' got into position and fired a spread of four torpedoes at her, two of which hit her in her holds. ''Paddle'' then torpedoed a second ship of the convoy, whose commander beached her to prevent her from sinking. The Japanese escorts then started unsuccessfully depth charging ''Paddle'', but she dived deep and escaped serious damage. 

The torpedoes that hit ''Shin'yō Maru'' killed or wounded many of the POWs, and some of her Japanese crew and guards. As she sank, the guards machine-gunned the POWs to try to prevent them from abandoning ship. The surviving ships of the convoy launched boats to rescue ''Shin'yō Maru''<nowiki/>'s crew and guards. A machine-gun mounted on the grounded ship also fired on the prisoners. Of 750 PoWs aboard the hell ship, 668 were killed. 83 got ashore alive, but one died the next day. 47 of her 52 Japanese crew and army guards were also killed.

The escaped POWs went inland, where they met a Filipino guerilla group commanded by a US Colonel McGee. The guerillas radioed US forces, who sent the submarine [[USS Narwhal (SS-167)|USS ''Narwhal'']] to rescue them. On 29 October 1944 ''Narwhal'' came into Sindangan Bay, where she embarked 81 of the 82 survivors. One survivor, Joseph Coe, chose to remain to serve with the guerillas.

On September 7, 2014, on the 70th anniversary of the incident, the municipality of Sindangan dedicated a memorial remembering the victims and survivors of the Shinyo Maru, as well as the townsfolk who extended their hospitality and help.<ref name="US War Memorials">{{cite web |title=Hell Ship Memorial- Shinyo Maru Sinking |url=https://www.uswarmemorials.org/html/monument_details.php?SiteID=2300&MemID=3018 |website=US War Memorials Overseas, Inc. |access-date=8 May 2023}}</ref>

===Potential for Cityhood===
Plans to convert Sindangan into a city started as early as 2006 upon observations that the town has become the most progressive and  the most income-generating municipality in Zamboanga Peninsula. This initiative, however, did not materialize after politicians who spearheaded the proposal did not win the following elections. Since 2020, Sindangan had surpassed two out of the three requirements for cityhood as mandated by the Local Government Code — its land area and total population. With an increasing number of investors in the last five years since 2017, the town is hopeful to meet the minimum annual income requirement of 100 million by the end of 2025. Currently, the local government has initiated a campaign called ''“'''Damgo Dos Mil Baynte Singko''''' ''[Eng: The 2025 Vision]''” where ambitious projects and massive remodelings are being done in all its vicinity in ways of addressing the town’s inadequacies, aiming to improve its facilities, and making the town a conducive place for investment in the upcoming years. With its vision to become the third city in Zamboanga del Norte (after [[Dipolog]] and [[Dapitan]]), and the sixth in Zamboanga Peninsula (after Dipolog, Dapitan, [[Pagadian]], [[Isabela, Basilan|Isabela]], and [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]]), the municipal government of Sindangan is venturing into big steps for them to make the grade and finally be able to file a bill in the congress for its conversion from a first class municipality to a chartered component city.

== Geography ==
Sindangan lies on the northwest corridor of Zamboanga del Norte. Its diverse geography ranges from [[Sulu Sea]] on the west and southwest, the Municipality of [[Leon B. Postigo|Leon Postigo]] on the south, the Municipality of [[Siayan, Zamboanga del Norte|Siayan]] on the east, the Municipality of [[Bayog]], Zamboanga del Sur on the southeast, and the Municipality of [[Jose Dalman]] on the north. Ranging from plain, slightly rolling, hilly to mountainous terrains, the Municipality of Sindangan embraces 45,100 hectares of land. Of its 52 barangays, 22 are situated along the seacoast, bountifully blessed with marine resources which gained Sindangan the title “the fishing capital of Zamboanga del Norte.”

It is approximately 86 kilometers away from [[Dipolog]] and 234 kilometers away from [[Zamboanga City]]. Hence, the municipality is identified as the trading hub of the province considering, this is a major terminal point for links to Dipolog down to [[Ipil, Zamboanga Sibugay|Ipil]] and further down south to Zamboanga City.
