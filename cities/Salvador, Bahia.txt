'''Salvador'''{{refn|group=n|The presented pronunciation in [[Brazilian Portuguese]] is {{IPA|pt|sawvaˈdoʁ|}} spoken around Brazil and most variants.}} is a [[Municipalities of Brazil|Brazilian municipality]] and [[capital city]] of the [[Federative units of Brazil|state]] of [[Bahia]]. Situated in the [[Zona da Mata]] in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region of Brazil]], Salvador is recognized throughout the country and internationally for its [[#Cuisine|cuisine]], [[#Music|music]], and [[#Pelourinho|architecture]]. The African influence in many cultural aspects of the city makes it a center of [[Afro-Brazilian]] culture. As the [[Capitals of Brazil|first capital]] of [[Colonial Brazil]], the city is [[List of oldest continuously inhabited cities|one of the oldest]] in the [[Americas]]. Its foundation in 1549 by [[Tomé de Sousa]] took place on account of the implementation of the [[List of governors-general of Brazil|General Government of Brazil]] by the [[Portuguese Empire]].

Centralization as a capital, along with Portuguese colonization, were important factors in shaping the profile of the municipality, as were certain geographic characteristics. The construction of the city followed the uneven [[topography]], initially with the formation of two levels—Upper Town (''{{lang|pt|Cidade Alta}}'') and Lower Town (''{{lang|pt|Cidade Baixa}}'')—on a steep [[escarpment]], and later with the conception of valley avenues. With {{Convert|692818|km2|mi2|sp=us}} in area, its emerged territory is [[Peninsula|peninsular]], and the coast is bordered by the [[Bay of All Saints]] to the west and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to the east. The [[Historic Center of Salvador]], iconized on the outskirts of {{lang|pt|[[Pelourinho]]|italic=no}}, is known for its colonial architecture, with historical monuments dating from the 17th century to the beginning of the 20th century, and was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]] in 1985. The stage of one of the [[Bahian Carnival|biggest Carnivals]] in the world (the biggest street party in the world, according to the ''[[Guinness World Records]]''), the integration of the municipality to the UNESCO's [[Creative Cities Network]] as the "City of Music", a unique title in the country, added to the international recognition of Salvador's music.

With more than 2.4 million inhabitants as of 2020, it is the most populous municipality in the Northeast, the fifth most populous in Brazil, and the ninth largest Latin American city. It is the core of the [[metropolitan area]] known as "Great Salvador", which had an estimated 3,957,123 inhabitants in 2020 according to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE). This makes it the second most populous metropolitan area in the Northeast, the [[List of metropolitan areas in Brazil|seventh in Brazil]], and one of the [[List of South American metropolitan areas by population|largest in South America]]. Also due to these urban-population dimensions, it is classified by the IBGE study on the [[Urban hierarchy in Brazil|Brazilian urban network]] as a regional [[metropolis]]. In its reports for the years 2014 and 2020, the Research Network of Globalization and World Cities (GaWC) classified Salvador as a [[global city]] in the "Sufficiency" category (the smallest). Global city surveys by consultancy Kearney also included Salvador in the 2018 and 2020 annual reports, while excluding it in the 2019.

The economic center of the state, Salvador is also a [[port city]], administrative and tourist center. Its metropolitan region has the highest GDP among urban concentrations in the Northeast. In 2018, it had the second-highest [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) among Northeastern municipalities. Furthermore, it is the headquarters of important regional, national and international companies, such as [[Novonor]], [[Braskem]], Neoenergy Coelba, and [[Suzano Papel e Celulose]]. In addition to companies, the city hosts or has hosted many cultural, political, educational, sports events and organizations, such as the [[Bahia State University]], the [[Federal University of Bahia]], the Brazilian Army Complementary Training School, the Brazilian Surfing Confederation, the 12th [[United Nations]] Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (in 2010), the third [[Ibero-American Summit]] (in 1993), the 2003 Pan-American Judo Championship, the second Conference of Intellectuals from Africa and the Diaspora (in 2006),<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 September 2006 |title=Second Conference of Intellectuals from Africa and the Diaspora |url=https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000146986 |access-date=2023-09-21 |website=unesdoc.unesco.org}}</ref> the [[1989 Copa América]], the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]], the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], and [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament – Group E|Group E]] of the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Women's tournament|women's football tournament]] in the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].

In 1572, the [[Governorate General of Brazil|Governorate of Brazil]] was divided into the separate governorates of [[Governorate General of Bahia|Bahia]] in the north and [[Governorate General of Rio de Janeiro|Rio de Janeiro]] in the south. These were reunited as Brazil six years later, then redivided from 1607 to 1613. By that time, [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] had [[Iberian Union|become temporarily united]] with [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] and was ruled from [[Madrid]] by its kings. In 1621, [[Philip III of Spain|King Philip III]] replaced the Governorate of Brazil with the [[State of Brazil|states of Brazil]], still based in Salvador and now controlling the south, and the [[State of Maranhão (colonial)|Maranhão]], which was centered on [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]] and controlled what is now northern Brazil. As Spain was then prosecuting a [[Dutch War of Independence|war against the independence of the Dutch]], the [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[Dutch East India Company|East]] and [[Dutch West India Company|West India companies]] [[Dutch–Portuguese War|tried to conquer Brazil]] from them. Salvador played a strategically vital role against [[Dutch Brazil]], but was [[Capture of Salvador da Bahia|captured and sacked]] by a West India Company fleet under [[Jacob Willekens]] and [[Piet Pieterszoon Hein|Piet Hein]] on 10 May 1624. [[Johan van Dorth]] administered the colony before his assassination, freeing its [[Slavery in Brazil|slaves]]. [[Recapture of Salvador da Bahia|The city was recaptured]] by a Luso-Spanish fleet under [[Fadrique Álvarez de Toledo y Mendoza]] on 1 May 1625. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], tried to conquer the city for his country, [[Siege of Salvador da Bahia (1638)|unsuccessfully besieging]] it between April and May 1638.

Salvador's population is the result of 500 years of [[interracial marriage]]. The majority of the population has African, European and Native American roots. The African ancestry of the city is from [[Benin]], [[Nigeria]], [[Angola]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Mozambique]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ecoviagem.uol.com.br/brasil/bahia/salvador/ |title=African ancestries in Salvador |language=en |publisher=Ecoviagem.uol.com.br |access-date=2017-09-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322222625/http://ecoviagem.uol.com.br/brasil/bahia/salvador/ |archive-date=22 March 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>[[File:Catedral Basílica Salvador 2019-6527.jpg|thumb|[[Mannerism|Mannerist]] [[Cathedral Basilica of Salvador]], the [[Primate (bishop)|Primate]] of Brazil (1657–1746<ref>Flexor, Maria Helena Ochi.

Those with surnames with a religious connotation were 53.1% African in genetic ancestry and tended to be in lower economic classes. During the colonial era, it was typical practice for Portuguese priests and missionaries to baptize converted African slaves and Native Americans with surnames of religious connotations. These have been passed down to their descendants.

A 2015 autosomal DNA study found out the following ancestral composition in Salvador: 50.5% of African ancestry, 42.4% of European ancestry and 5.8% of Native American ancestry.<ref name="Lima-Costa Rodrigues Barreto et al 2015">{{cite journal |last1=Lima-Costa |first1=M.

In Salvador, religion is a major contact point between Portuguese and African influences and, in the last 20 years, Brazil's version of a North American-influenced Pentecostalism.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.touristlink.com.br/Brasil/salvador/overview.html |title=Religion Salvador |language=pt |publisher=Touristlink.com.br |access-date=2014-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927184354/http://www.touristlink.com.br/Brasil/salvador/overview.html |archive-date=27 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> Salvador was the seat of the first [[Diocese|bishopric]] in colonial Brazil (established 1551), and the first bishop, ''Pero Fernandes Sardinha'', arrived already in 1552.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/Ancillary/BeagleLibrary/1810_Southey_A854.01.html |title=1st bishop in Brazil |publisher=Darwin-online.org.uk |date=2013-05-14 |access-date=2014-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927074805/http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/Ancillary/BeagleLibrary/1810_Southey_A854.01.html |archive-date=27 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Jesuit]]s, led by the [[Manuel da Nóbrega]], also arrived in the 16th century and worked in converting the [[Indigenous peoples]] of the region to Roman [[Catholicism]].

Many religious orders came to the city, following its foundation: [[Franciscans]], [[Benedictines]] and [[Carmelites]]. Subsequently, to them are created the Third Orders, the Brotherhoods, and Fraternities, which were composed mainly of professional and social groups. The most prominent of these orders were the Terceira do Carmo Order and the de São Francisco Order, founded by white men, and the Nossa Senhora do Rosário and São Beneditino Brotherhoods, composed of black men.<ref name="latinamerica3000.ru">[http://www.latinamerica3000.ru/en/tourism/destinations/Salvador?mode=gal222222&mode=gal2222&mode=gal22 Salvador – Religion] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714144005/http://www.latinamerica3000.ru/en/tourism/destinations/Salvador?mode=gal222222&mode=gal2222&mode=gal22 |date=14 July 2014 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref> In many churches maintained by religious men, were housed the Santíssimo Sacramento brotherhoods.
[[File:Capela de Nossa Senhora da Conceição Solar do Unhão Salvador Bahia 2021-8635.jpg|thumb|Capilla de Nuestra Señora de la Concepción Solar do Unhão Salvador Bahía]]
Besides these organizations, the expansion of [[Catholicism]] in the city was consolidated through social care work. Santa Casa the Misericórdia was one of the institution that did this kind of work, maintaining hospitals, shelters for the poor and the elderly, as well providing assistance to convicts and to those who would face death penalties.<ref name="latinamerica3000.ru" /> The [[convent]]s, on their part, were cultural and religious formation centers, offering seminar coursed that often were attended by the lay.

Even with the present evolution, and the growth of [[Protestantism]] and other religions in the city, the Catholic faith remains as one of its most distinctive features, drawing a lot of people to its hundreds of churches. Some aspects, like the use of Portuguese in the Masses, the simplification of the liturgy, and the adoption of "[[pop music|pop]]" [[religious]] [[song]]s are key factors to the triumph of [[Catholicism]]. In the Nossa Senhora do Rosário dos Pretos Church, Masses are held in th''e [[Yoruba language|Yorùbá]]'' language, making use of African chants and typical clothes, which attract many people from the [[African Brazilian]] communities.<ref name="latinamerica3000.ru" />

Most enslaved Africans in Bahia were brought from [[Sub-Saharan Africa]], especially the [[Yoruba religion|Yorùbá]][[Yoruba language|-speaking]] nation (''Iorubá'' or ''Nagô'' in Portuguese) from present-day [[Benin]]. The enslaved were forced to convert to Roman Catholicism, but their original religion [[Yoruba religion|Yorùbá]] was combined with Roman Catholicism to make the syncretic religion known as, [[Candomblé]], which has survived in spite of prohibitions and persecutions. The enslaved Africans managed to preserve their religion by attributing the names and characteristics of their Yorùbá deities to Catholic saints with similar qualities. Still today all Candomble sessions are conducted in Yoruba, not Portuguese.[[File:Casa de Iemanjá-893.jpg|thumb|The religious house that holds the Afro-Brazilian goddess Yemanjá in Salvador.]]These religious entities have been syncretised with some Catholic entities. For instance, Salvador's [[Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim (Salvador)|Feast of Bonfim]], celebrated in January, is dedicated to both Our Lord of Bonfim ([[Jesus Christ]]) and Oxalá. Another important feast is the Feast de Yemanja every 2 February, on the shores of the borough of Rio Vermelho in

Salvador, on the day the church celebrates Our Lady of the Navigators. 8 December, Immaculate Conception Day for Catholics, is also commonly dedicated to Yemanja' with votive offerings made in the sea throughout the Brazilian coast.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

Throughout [[History of Brazil|Brazilian history]] Salvador has played an important role. Because of its location on Brazil's northeastern coast, the city served as an important link in the [[Portuguese empire]] throughout the [[Colonial Brazil|colonial era]], maintaining close commercial ties with [[Portugal]] and Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia.<ref>[http://www.brazilaccommodation.org/salvador.html Economy of Salvador] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821072920/http://www.brazilaccommodation.org/salvador.html |date=21 August 2013 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>

Salvador remained the preeminent city in Brazil until 1763 when it was replaced as the national capital by [[Rio de Janeiro]]. In the last ten years many high-rise office and apartment buildings were constructed, sharing the same blocks with colonial-era housing or commercial buildings.<ref>[http://www.worldpeacejournal.com/apps/blog/show/prev?from_id=7196252&sms_ss=twitter&at_xt=4de040cf9da5b2dc,0 About Salvador]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404004858/http://www.worldpeacejournal.com/apps/blog/show/prev?from_id=7196252&sms_ss=twitter&at_xt=4de040cf9da5b2dc%2C0 |date=4 April 2012 }}</ref>

==Government and politics==
[[File:Fórum_Ruy_Barbosa.jpg|thumb|Ruy Barbosa Forum]]
{{See also|List of mayors of Salvador, Bahia}}Salvador's history as the first political capital of Brazil and as the capital of Bahia has meant that the city has historically exerted significant influence of both state and federal politics. Because of its importance as the largest port for imported slaves in Brazil, its early political history was dominated by a conservative slaveholding class. Bahia was a monarchy stronghold during the movement for Brazilian independence and was the last to join the new Empire of Brazil. Despite the abolition of slavery, expansion of the franchise and steady migration of Afro-Brazilians from the Bahian countryside into the city, the city's elected offices have and continue to be dominated by a mostly European-descended upper class in a majority Black city. Afro-Brazilians continue to be underrepresented politically and urban renewal efforts have increasingly displaced them out of the historical city center towards the suburbs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Keisha-Khan |first1=Y. Perry |title=The roots of black resistance: race, gender and the struggle for urban land rights in Salvador, Bahia, Brazil |journal=Social Identities |date=November 2004 |volume=10 |issue=6 |pages=811–831 |doi=10.1080/1350463042000324283 |s2cid=145675989 }}</ref> Examples of the city's political elite include the Magalhães family, which in the last 50 years has held positions for mayor of Salvador ([[Antônio Carlos Magalhães|Antônio Carlos]] and his grandson [[ACM Neto]]), governor of Bahia (Antônio Carlos), senator (Antônio Carlos and his son Antônio Júnior) and federal deputy (uncle Luís Eduardo and nephew ACM Neto). The control of the state of Bahia, and by extension Salvador, under political boss Antônio Carlos Magalhães was marked by an authoritarian style of [[clientelism]] known locally as ''carlismo''.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herrmann |first1=Julián Durazo |title=Reflections on Regime Change and Democracy in Bahia, Brazil |journal=Latin American Research Review |date=2014 |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=23–44 |doi=10.1353/lar.2014.0050 |s2cid=144223560 }}</ref>

Since January 2021, the mayor of Salvador has been [[Bruno Soares Reis]] of the [[Brazil Union|União Brasil]] party (DEM). The office of mayor has a 4 year term and works with a deputy mayor, also an elected 4 year position. The current deputy mayor is Ana Paula Matos (PDT). In recent decades, the position has been held by mostly members of center-right parties such as the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB), Brazilian Social Democracy Party (PSDB) and more recently the Democrats (DEM).

There are 43 councilors in the Salvador City Council, most recently elected in 2020. [[Geraldo Júnior]] (MDB) had been the president of the City Council.{{further ill|Salvador City Council|pt|Câmara Municipal de Salvador}}

The Salvador coastline is one of the longest for cities in Brazil. There are {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} of beaches distributed between the High City and the Low City, from Inema, in the railroad suburb to the Praia do Flamengo, on the other side of town. While the Low City beaches are bordered by the waters of the [[All Saints Bay]] (the country's most extensive bay), the High City beaches, from Farol da Barra to Flamengo, are bordered by the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. The exception is [[Porto da Barra Beach]], the only High City beach located in the All Saints Bay.

The capital's beaches range from calm inlets, ideal for swimming, sailing, diving and underwater fishing, as well as open sea inlets with strong waves, sought by [[surfer]]s. There are also beaches surrounded by [[reef]]s, forming natural pools of stone, ideal for children.

Interesting places to visit near Salvador include:
* According to the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'', in 2007, [[Porto da Barra Beach]] was the third best in the world.<ref>{{cite news |author=Gavin McOwan |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/feb/16/beach.top10?page=2 |title=Top 10 beaches of the world &#124; Travel |work=The Guardian|date=2007-02-16 |access-date=2010-04-17 |location=London |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927194046/https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2007/feb/16/beach.top10?page=2 |archive-date=27 September 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Created by state decree in 1973, Pituaçu Park occupies an area of 450 hectares and is one of the few Brazilian ecological parks located in an [[urban area]]. It is surrounded by [[Atlantic forest]], with a good variety of plants and animals. There is also an artificial pond in the park, built in 1906 along with the Pituaçu Dam, whose purpose was to supply water to the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.360brazil.co.uk/salvador-tourism-and-recreation/ |title=Salvador: tourism and recreation |publisher=360brazil.co.uk |date=2013-02-03 |access-date=2014-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140330083353/http://www.360brazil.co.uk/salvador-tourism-and-recreation/ |archive-date=30 March 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Salvador's historical and cultural aspects were inherited by the intermarriage of such ethnic groups as Native-Indian, African and European. This mixture can be seen in the religion, cuisine, cultural manifestations, and custom of Bahia's people. African cultural practices are particularly celebrated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ibahia.com/especiais/vozesdobrasil/cidades/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140422113544/http://www.ibahia.com/especiais/vozesdobrasil/cidades/|title=Salvador metropolitan area and African Culture|archive-date=22 April 2014}}</ref>

[[Gregório de Mattos]], born in Salvador in 1636, was also educated by the Jesuits. He became the most important [[Baroque literature|Baroque poet]] in colonial Brazil for his religious and satirical works. [[Father António Vieira]] was born in Lisbon in 1608, but was raised and educated in the Jesuit school of Salvador and died in the city in 1697. His erudite [[sermon]]s have earned him the title of best writer of the [[Portuguese language]] in the Baroque era.<ref>{{cite web |last=Brazil |first=Projecto |url=http://projectobrazil.blogspot.com/2008/07/salvador-de-bahia-information.html |title=Portuguese language in the Baroque era |publisher=Projectobrazil.blogspot.com |date=2008-07-25 |access-date=2010-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020162219/http://projectobrazil.blogspot.com/2008/07/salvador-de-bahia-information.html |archive-date=20 October 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the [[Independence of Brazil]] (1822), Salvador continued to play an important role in Brazilian literature. Significant 19th-century writers associated with the city include [[Romanticism|Romantic]] poet [[Castro Alves]] (1847–1871) and diplomat [[Ruy Barbosa]] (1849–1923). In the 20th century, Bahia-born [[Jorge Amado]] (1912–2001), although not born in Salvador, helped popularize the culture of the city around the world in novels such as ''[[Jubiabá]]'', ''[[Dona Flor e Seus Dois Maridos]]'', and ''[[Tenda dos Milagres (novel)|Tenda dos Milagres]]'', the settings of which are in Salvador.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Cuisine===
[[File:Acarajes.jpg|thumb|[[Acarajé]] is a traditional street food in Salvador.|alt=]]
The local cuisine, spicy and based on seafood (shrimp, fish), strongly relies on typically African ingredients and techniques, and is much appreciated throughout Brazil and internationally. The most typical ingredient is ''[[Palm oil|azeite-de-dendê]]'', an oil extracted from a palm tree (''Elaeis guineensis'') brought from [[West Africa]] to Brazil during colonial times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.touristlink.com.br/Brasil/salvador/overview.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927184354/http://www.touristlink.com.br/Brasil/salvador/overview.html|title=Salvador, Brasil Social Travel Network|archive-date=27 September 2013|website=TouristLink}}</ref>

Using the milky [[coconut]] juice, they prepared a variety of [[seafood]] based dishes, such as Ensopados, Moquecas and Escabeche. The [[sugar cane]] bagasse was mixed with molasses and Rapadura, in the creation of coconut desserts like Cocada Branca and Preta. The remaining of the Portuguese Stew sauce was mixed with [[manioc]] flour to make a mush, which is a traditional Indian dish.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.touristlink.com.br/Brasil/salvador/overview.html |title=Cuisine – Salvador |language=pt |publisher=Touristlink.com.br |access-date=2014-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927184354/http://www.touristlink.com.br/Brasil/salvador/overview.html |archive-date=27 September 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the markets of Salvador, it is possible to find stands selling typical dishes of the colonial era. In the Sete Portas Market, customers eat Mocotó on Friday nights since the 1940s, when the market was inaugurated. In the restaurants of [[Mercado Modelo (Salvador)|Mercado Modelo]], Sarapatel, stews and several fried dishes are served regularly. In the São Joaquim, Santa Bárbara and São Miguel markets, there are stands selling typical food. They are also sold at stands located on the beaches, specially crab stews and oysters. The restaurants that sell typical dishes are located mostly along the coast and in Pelourinho. They prepare a wide variety of recipes that take [[palm oil|palm tree oil]].

Traditional dishes include ''[[caruru (food)|caruru]]'', ''[[vatapá]]'', ''[[acarajé]]'', ''[[bobó-de-camarão]]'', ''[[moqueca]]'' baiana, and ''abará''. Some of these dishes, like the acarajé and abará, are also used as offerings in [[Candomblé]] rituals. But Salvador is not only typical food. Other recipes created by the slaves were the Haussá Rice (rice and jerked [[beef]] cooked together), the Munguzá, used as offering to the Candomblé deity Oxalá (who is the father of all deities, according to the religion) pleased the matrons very much. So did the Bolinhos the Fubá, the Cuscuz (cornmeal) and the Mingau (porridge). According to Arany Santana, the African Ipetê (used in the [[ritual]]s to the deity [[Oxum]]) became the [[Shrimp bobó]], and the Akará (honoring the deities Xangô and Iansã) became the world-famous Acarajé. The city has restaurants specialized on international cuisine also. There are also places that serve dishes from other states of [[Brazil]], especially from [[Minas Gerais]] and the [[Northeastern Brazil|Northeast region]].

The craftsmen and women generally choose religion as the main theme of their work.

They portray the images of Catholic saints and Candomble deities on their pieces. The good luck charms such as the clenched fist, the four-leaf clover, the garlic and the famous Bonfim ribbons express the city's religious syncretism. Nature is also portrayed on these pieces, reflecting the local [[wildlife]].

==Neighborhoods==
[[File:Praia_da_Barra_001.jpg|alt=|thumb|[[Barra (Neighborhood)|Barra]] neighborhood in South Zone]]
Although the creation of Salvador was masterminded by the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] and its layout overseen by the Portuguese engineer Luís Dias (who was responsible for the city's original design), the continuous growth of the capital through the decades was completely spontaneous. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} The walls of the city-fortress could not hold the expansion of the city towards the Carmo and the area where now stands [[Castro Alves]] Square. At the time of its foundation, Salvador had only two squares and the first neighborhood ever built here was the Historic City Center. {{lang|pt|[[Pelourinho]]|italic=no}} and Carmo came subsequently, created as a consequence of the growing need of space that the [[Religion in Brazil|religious]] orders had. With the rapid expansion, the neighborhoods grew and many of them were clustered in the same area, so today there are not accurate records as to their exact number. For urban management purposes, the city is currently divided on 17 political-administrative zones. However, due to their very [[culture of Brazil|cultural]] relevance and to postal conveniences, the importance of the neighborhoods of Salvador remains intact.

[[File:Vista de Salvador da ponta da Barra.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Salvador|alt=]]

Salvador is divided into a number of distinct neighborhoods, which can be categorized by which geographic zone they are located in; West, South or East. The most well known districts, including {{lang|pt|[[Pelourinho]]|italic=no}}, [[Comércio]], and Old Downtown, are all located in the West Zone. [[Barra (Neighborhood)|Barra]], with its beaches and starting point to one of the city's Carnival circuits, is located in the South Zone. [[Vitória (Neighborhood)|Vitória]], a neighborhood with many high rise buildings, is located in South Zone.

===Pelourinho===
{{Main|Historic Center (Salvador)}}
[[File:Largo do Pelourinho - Salvador.JPG|thumb|View of Largo do Pelourinho]]
[[File:Salvador-CCBY-2.jpg|thumb|Old houses in the historical center of Salvador.]]
The [[Historic Center (Salvador)|Historic Center of Salvador]] was designated in 1985 a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref name=unesco/> The city represents a fine example of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] [[urbanism]] from the middle of the 16th century with its higher administrative town and its lower commercial town, and a large portion of the city has retained the old character of its streets and colourful houses.

As the first capital of [[Empire of Brazil|Portuguese America]], Salvador cultivated slave labor and had its [[pillory|pillories]] ("{{lang|pt|pelourinhos}}") installed in open places like the Terreiro de Jesus and the squares know today as [[Tomé de Sousa]] and [[Castro Alves]]. The pillories were a symbol of authority and justice for some and of lashings and injustice for the majority.<ref>{{cite web |author=Projecto Brazil |url=http://projectobrazil.blogspot.com/2008/07/salvador-de-bahia-information.html |title=Projecto Brazil |publisher=Projectobrazil.blogspot.com |date=2008-07-25 |access-date=2014-01-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020162219/http://projectobrazil.blogspot.com/2008/07/salvador-de-bahia-information.html |archive-date=20 October 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> The one erected for a short time in what is now the Historical Center, and later moved to what is now the Praça da Piedade (Square of Piety), ended up lending its name to the historical and architectural complex of {{lang|pt|[[Pelourinho]]|italic=no}}, part of the city's upper town.

Since 1992, the {{lang|pt|[[Pelourinho]]|italic=no}} neighborhood has been subject to a nearly US$100&nbsp;million "restoration" that has led to the rebuilding of hundreds of buildings' façades and the expulsion of the vast majority of the neighborhood's Afro-descendent population. This process has given rise to substantial political debate in the State of [[Bahia]], since the Pelourinho's former residents have been for the most part excluded from the renovation's economic benefits (reaped by a few).<ref>{{Cite book|title=Revolt of the Saints: Memory and Redemption in the Twilight of Brazilian Racial Democracy|last=Collins|first=John|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2015|isbn=9780822353065|location=Durham}}</ref> A major restoration effort resulted in making the area a [[tourist]] [[Tourist attraction|attraction]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gosouthamerica.about.com/cs/southamerica/a/BraPelourinho.htm |title=New Pelourinho |publisher=Gosouthamerica.about.com |date=2010-03-05 |access-date=2010-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090807072955/http://gosouthamerica.about.com/cs/southamerica/a/BraPelourinho.htm |archive-date=7 August 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Salvador's considerable wealth and status during colonial times (as capital of the colony during 250 years and which gave rise to the Pelourinho) is reflected in the magnificence of its colonial [[palace]]s, [[church (building)|churches]] and [[convent]]s, most of them dating from the 17th and 18th centuries. These include:

* [[Cathedral of Salvador]]: Former [[Jesuit]] church of the city, built in the second half of the 17th century. Fine example of [[Mannerist]] architecture and decoration.
* [[São Francisco Church and Convent (Salvador)|Convent and Church of São Francisco]]: Franciscan convent and church dating from the first half of the 18th century is another fine example of the Portuguese [[colonial architecture]]. The [[Baroque]] decoration of the church is among the finest in Brazil.
* [[Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim (Salvador)|Church of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim]]: [[Rococo]] church with [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] inner decoration. The image of Nosso Senhor do Bonfim is the most venerated in the city, and the Feast of Our Lord of Good Ending (''Festa de Nosso Senhor do Bonfim'') in January is the most important in the city after [[#Carnival|Carnival]].
* [[Mercado Modelo (Salvador)|Mercado Modelo]] (Model Market): In 1861, at the Cayrú Square, the Customs Building was constructed, with a rotunda (large circular room with a domed ceiling) at the back end, where ships anchored to unload their merchandise.
* [[Lacerda Elevator]] (''{{lang|pt|Elevador Lacerda}}''): Inaugurated in 1873, this elevator was planned and built by the businessman Antônio Francisco de Lacerda, The four elevator cages connect the {{convert|72|m|ft}} between the [[Thomé de Souza]] Square in the upper city, and the Cayru Square in the lower city. In each run, which lasts for 22 seconds, the elevator transports 128 persons, 24 hours a day.

==Sports==
{{see also|Sports in Brazil|2014 FIFA World Cup}}
[[File:Estádio Roberto Santos (2009).jpg|thumb|Pituaçu Stadium|alt=|left]]
Salvador provides visitors and residents with various sport activities. The [[Estádio Fonte Nova]], also known as Estádio Octávio Mangabeira is a [[football (soccer)|football]] stadium inaugurated on 28 January 1951 in Salvador, [[Bahia]], with a maximum capacity of 66,080 people. The stadium has now been replaced with a new stadium named [[Itaipava Arena Fonte Nova]] with a capacity of 56,000 people. This stadium hosted matches of [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] and the subsequent [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], as well as the football competition in the [[2016 Summer Olympics]].  The stadium is owned by the Bahia government, and is the home ground of [[Esporte Clube Bahia]]. Its formal name honors Octávio Cavalcanti Mangabeira, a civil engineer, journalist, and former Bahia state governor from 1947 to 1954. The stadium is nicknamed Fonte Nova, because it is located at Ladeira das Fontes das Pedras. The stadium was in 2007 closed due to an accident, and the E.C. Bahia home matches now happen in another stadium, in Pituaçu.

[[Esporte Clube Bahia]] and [[Esporte Clube Vitória]] are Salvador's main football teams. Bahia has won 2 national titles, the [[Taça Brasil]] in 1959 and the Brazilian League in 1988, while Vitória was a runner up in the Brazilian league in 1993 and the [[Copa do Brasil]] in 2010. Smaller teams include [[EC Ypiranga]] with 10 titles of the [[Campeonato Baiano]], [[Botafogo Sport Club|Botafogo SC]] with 7, [[Galícia Esporte Clube|Galícia EC]] with 5, and [[Associação Desportiva Leônico|AD Leônico]] with 2.

[[File:Estádio Manoel Barradas Vitória.jpg|thumb|Manoel Barradas Stadium|alt=]]
During the last decades, [[volleyball]] has grown steadily in Salvador, especially after the gold medal won by Brazil in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in Barcelona.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}} The most important tournaments in [[Bahia]] are the State Championship, the State League tournament and the Primavera Games, and the main teams are Associação Atlética da Bahia, Bahiano de Tênis, and Clube the Regatas Itapagipe. There are also [[beach volleyball]] events. Salvador has housed many international tournaments. Federação Bahina de Voleibol (the state league) can inform the schedule of tournaments. [[Bowling]] is practiced both by teenagers and adults in Salvador. Boliche do Aeroclube and Space Bowling are equipped with automatic lanes as well as a complete bar infrastructure.
[[File:Arena_Fonte_Nova_External_View.jpg|thumb|[[Fonte Nova Arena]]|alt=|left]]
[[Bahia]]'s [[basketball]] league exists since 1993 and has 57 [[team]]s. The sport is very popular in the city of Salvador, especially among students.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asbacsalvador.com.br/basquete.htm |title=Basketball in Salvador |publisher=Asbacsalvador.com.br |access-date=2010-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925195558/http://www.asbacsalvador.com.br/basquete.htm |archive-date=25 September 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> There are several courts scattered across the city, where is possible to play for free, like the one located at Bahia Sol square, where people play.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.digidata.com.br/fbbm/clip.php?consulta=sim&atual=Clipping&codcli=587 |title=Brazilian Federation of Basketball |publisher=Digidata.com.br |access-date=2010-04-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706152118/http://www.digidata.com.br/fbbm/clip.php?consulta=sim&atual=Clipping&codcli=587 |archive-date=6 July 2011}}</ref> There are also several [[gym]]nasiums, in [[Club (organization)|club]]s like Bahiano de Tênis and Associação Atlética and the Antonio Balbino Gymnasiums (popularly known as "Balbininho"), which is an arena that can hold up to 7,000 people.

Todos os Santos Bay and Salvador's climatic conditions are ideal for competition and recreational [[sailing]]. The city is equipped with good infrastructure for practice of sailing, such as rental and sale of dock space, boat maintenance, restaurants, snack bar, convenience stores, nautical products stores, boat rental agencies, VHF and SSB communication systems, events, and total assistance to crews.<ref name="accommodationbrazil.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.accommodationbrazil.org/salvador.html|title=Salvador – 2014 soccer World Cup Host City|language=en|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006163918/http://www.accommodationbrazil.org/salvador.html|archive-date=6 October 2014}}</ref> The large number of sailing events organized by [[Club (organization)|club]]s and [[syndicate]]s, like oceanic races and typical boats (wooden fishing boats and [[canoe]]s) races, demonstrates the sport's growing force. Currently, Salvador has a national racing schedule with dozens of events, also receiving the [[Mini Transat 6.50]] and Les Illes du Soleil races.<ref name="accommodationbrazil.org"/>

[[Rowing boat]] races started in the city more than a hundred years ago.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.campos.rj.gov.br/noticia.php?id=15339 |title=Rowing boat in Salvador |publisher=Campos.rj.gov.br |access-date=2010-04-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111202838/http://www.campos.rj.gov.br/noticia.php?id=15339 |archive-date=11 January 2009 }}</ref> It was originally practiced by young men from traditional families, who spent their summer vacations there. The sport is a leisure option in Cidade Baixa (the lower part of the city). [[Esporte Clube Vitória]] and Clube São Salvador were the pioneers in the sport. Nowadays, these two entities and also Clube de Regatas Itapagipe lead the competitions that take place in the city. With the recent renovation of the Dique do Tororó area, Salvador received new lanes for the practice of the sport.
