The European settlement of Mobile began with French colonists, who in 1702 constructed ''[[Old Mobile Site|Fort Louis de la Louisiane]]'', at Twenty-seven Mile Bluff on the [[Mobile River]], as the first capital of the [[French colonial empires|French colony]] of [[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]]. It was founded by [[French Canadian]] brothers [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] and [[Jean-Baptiste Le Moyne, Sieur de Bienville]], to establish control over France's claims to ''La Louisiane''. Bienville was appointed as royal governor of French Louisiana in 1701. Mobile's Roman Catholic parish was established on July 20, 1703, by [[Jean-Baptiste de la Croix de Chevrières de Saint-Vallier]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]].<ref name="oldmobile1">Higginbotham, Jay.

In 1704, the ship [[French ship Pélican (1702)|''Pélican'']] delivered 23 Frenchwomen to the colony; passengers had contracted [[yellow fever]] at a stop in [[Havana]].<ref name="pelican">Thomason (2001), ''Mobile'', pp. 20–21.</ref> Though most of the "''Pélican'' girls" recovered, numerous colonists and neighboring Native Americans contracted the disease in turn and many died.<ref name="pelican"/> This early period was also the occasion of the importation of the first African [[slaves]], transported aboard a French supply ship from the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]] in the [[Caribbean]], where they had first been held.<ref name="pelican"/> The population of the colony fluctuated over the next few years, growing to 279 persons by 1708, yet shrinking to 178 persons two years later due to disease.<ref name="oldmobile1"/>

These additional outbreaks of disease and a series of floods resulted in Bienville ordering in 1711 that the settlement be relocated several miles downriver to its present location at the confluence of the [[Mobile River]] and [[Mobile Bay]].<ref>Thomason, Michael.

The capital of [[Louisiana (New France)|La Louisiane]] was moved in 1720 to [[Biloxi, Mississippi|Biloxi]],<ref name="MoMfort"/> leaving Mobile to serve as a regional military and trading center. In 1723 the construction of a new brick fort with a stone foundation began<ref name="MoMfort"/> and it was renamed Fort Condé in honor of [[Louis Henri, Duke of Bourbon]].<ref name="conde1">{{cite web |title=Historic Fort Conde |work=Museum of Mobile |url=http://www.museumofmobile.com/html/other_museums.php |access-date=October 18, 2007}}</ref>

In 1763, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] was signed, ending the [[Seven Years' War]], which Britain won, defeating France. By this treaty, France ceded its territories east of the Mississippi River to Britain.

The British were eager not to lose any useful inhabitants and promised religious tolerance to the French colonists; ultimately 112 French colonists remained in Mobile.<ref name="britmob1">Thomason (2001), ''Mobile'', pp. 44–45</ref> The first permanent Jewish settlers came to Mobile in 1763 as a result of the new British rule and religious tolerance. Jews had not been allowed to officially reside in colonial French Louisiana due to the [[Code Noir]], a decree passed by France's King Louis XIV in 1685 that forbade the exercise of any religion other than Roman Catholicism, and ordered all Jews out of France's colonies. Most of these colonial-era Jews in Mobile were merchants and traders from Sephardic Jewish communities in [[Savannah, Georgia]] and [[Charleston, South Carolina]]; they added to the commercial development of Mobile.<ref>Zietz, Robert (1994).

Mobile was well situated for trade, as its location tied it to a river system that served as the principal navigational access for most of Alabama and a large part of Mississippi. River transportation was aided by the introduction of [[steamboat]]s in the early decades of the 19th century.<ref>

From the 1830s onward, Mobile expanded into a city of commerce with a primary focus on the cotton and slave trades. Many slaves were transported by ship in the [[coastwise slave trade]] from the Upper South. There were many businesses in the city related to the slave trade – people to make clothes, food, and supplies for the slave traders and their wards. The city's booming businesses attracted merchants from the North; by 1850 10% of its population was from [[New York City]], which was deeply involved in the cotton industry.<ref>[http://mshistorynow.mdah.state.ms.us/articles/161/cotton-in-a-global-economy-mississippi-1800-1860 Eugene R.

The prosperity stimulated a building boom that was underway by the mid-1830s, with the building of some of the most elaborate structures the city had seen up to that point. This was cut short in part by the [[Panic of 1837]] and [[yellow fever]] epidemics.<ref name="antebellum2">{{cite book |last=Thomason |first=Michael |title=Mobile: the new history of Alabama's first city |pages=69–71 |location=Tuscaloosa, Alabama |publisher=University of Alabama Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-8173-1065-7}}</ref> The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses.<ref name="antebellum1"/> The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]]; by 1840 Mobile was second only to [[New Orleans]] in cotton exports in the nation.<ref name="antebellum1"/>

===20th century===
[[File:Van Antwerp Building 1907.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|The [[Van Antwerp Building]], completed in 1907]]
The turn of the 20th century brought the [[Progressive Era]] to Mobile. The economic structure developed with new industries, generating new jobs and attracting a significant increase in population.<ref name="progress1">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile: The New History of Alabama's First City'', pages 154–169. Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8173-1065-7}}</ref> The population increased from around 40,000 in 1900 to 60,000 by 1920.<ref name="progress1"/> During this time the city received $3 million in federal grants for harbor improvements to deepen the shipping channels.<ref name="progress1"/> During and after World War I, manufacturing became increasingly vital to Mobile's economic health, with shipbuilding and steel production being two of the most important industries.<ref name="progress1"/>

During this time, social justice and race relations in Mobile worsened, however.<ref name="progress1"/> The state passed a new constitution in 1901 that [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks and many poor whites]]; and the white Democratic-dominated legislature passed other discriminatory legislation. In 1902, the city government passed Mobile's first [[racial segregation]] ordinance, segregating the city streetcars. It legislated what had been informal practice, enforced by convention.<ref name="progress1"/> Mobile's African-American population responded to this with a two-month boycott, but the law was not repealed.<ref name="progress1"/> After this, Mobile's ''de facto'' segregation was increasingly replaced with legislated segregation as whites imposed [[Jim Crow laws]] to maintain [[white supremacy|supremacy]].<ref name="progress1"/>

In 1911 the city adopted a commission form of government, which had three members elected by [[at-large]] voting. Considered to be progressive, as it would reduce the power of ward bosses, this change resulted in the elite white majority strengthening its power, as only the majority could gain election of at-large candidates. In addition, poor whites and blacks had already been disenfranchised. Mobile was one of the last cities to retain this form of government, which prevented smaller groups from electing candidates of their choice. But Alabama's white yeomanry had historically favored [[single-member districts]] in order to elect candidates of their choice.<ref name="vra">[http://www.protectcivilrights.org/pdf/voting/AlabamaVRA.pdf James Blacksher, Edward Still, Nick Quinton, Cullen Brown, and Royal Dumas, "Voting Rights in Alabama 1982–2006"], July 2006, RenewtheVRA.org, accessed March 12, 2015</ref>

During [[World War II]], the defense buildup in Mobile shipyards resulted in a considerable increase in the city's white middle-class and working-class population, largely due to the massive influx of workers coming to work in the shipyards and at the [[Brookley Air Force Base|Brookley Army Air Field]].<ref name="thomason2">Thomason, Michael. ''Mobile: The New History of Alabama's First City'', pp. 213–217.

Mobile was one of eighteen United States cities producing [[Liberty ships]]. Its [[Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company]] (ADDSCO) supported the war effort by producing ships faster than the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis powers]] could sink them. ADDSCO also churned out a copious number of [[T2 tanker]]s for the War Department.<ref name="thomason2"/> [[Gulf Shipbuilding Corporation]], a subsidiary of [[Waterman Steamship Corporation]], focused on building [[Cargo ship|freighters]], {{sclass|Fletcher|destroyer}}s, and [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweepers]].<ref name="thomason2"/> The rapid increase of population in the city produced crowded conditions, increasing social tensions in the competition for housing and good jobs.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

In May 1943, a [[race riot]] broke out between whites and blacks. ADDSCO management had long maintained segregated conditions at the shipyards, although the Roosevelt administration had ordered defense contractors to integrate facilities. That year ADDSCO promoted 12 blacks to positions as welders, previously reserved for whites; and whites objected to the change by rioting on May 24. The mayor appealed to the governor to call in the [[National Guard (United States)|National Guard]] to restore order, but it was weeks before officials allowed African Americans to return to work,<ref name="addsco">[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/article/h-1475 Scotty E. Kirkland, "Alabama Drydock and Shipbuilding Company (ADDSCO)"]. ''Encyclopedia of Alabama'' online, 2008, update August 10, 2015</ref> keeping them away for their safety.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

In the late 1940s, the transition to the postwar economy was hard for the city, as thousands of jobs were lost at the shipyards with the decline in the defense industry. Eventually the city's social structure began to become more liberal. Replacing shipbuilding as a primary economic force, the paper and chemical industries began to expand. No longer needed for defense, most of the old military bases were converted to civilian uses. Following the war, in which many African Americans had served, veterans and their supporters stepped up activism to gain enforcement of their constitutional rights and social justice, especially in the [[Jim Crow]] South. During the 1950s the City of Mobile integrated its police force and [[Spring Hill College]] accepted students of all races. Unlike in the rest of the state, by the early 1960s the city buses and lunch counters voluntarily desegregated.<ref name="thomason2"/>

The Alabama legislature passed the Cater Act in 1949, allowing cities and counties to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. [[George E. McNally]], Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was the driving force behind the founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.<ref>Bill Patterson, "The Founding of the Industrial Development Board of the City of Mobile: The Port City's Reluctant Use of Subsidies", ''Gulf South Historical Review'' 2000 15(2): 21–40,</ref>

In 1963, three African-American students brought a case against the Mobile County School Board for being denied admission to [[Murphy High School, Alabama|Murphy High School]].<ref name="murphy1">Thomason (2001), ''Mobile'', pp. 260–261</ref> This was nearly a decade after the United States Supreme Court had ruled in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. The federal district court ordered that the three students be admitted to Murphy for the 1964 school year, leading to the desegregation of Mobile County's school system.<ref name="murphy1"/>

The [[civil rights movement]] gained congressional passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], eventually ending legal segregation and regaining effective suffrage for African Americans. But whites in the state had more than one way to reduce African Americans' voting power. Maintaining the city commission form of government with [[at-large]] voting resulted in all positions being elected by the white majority, as African Americans could not command a majority for their candidates in the informally segregated city.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

In 1969, the [[Brookley Air Force Base]] was closed by the Department of Defense, dealing a severe blow to Mobile's economy. The closing resulted in a 10% unemployment rate in the city. This and other factors related to industrial restructuring ushered in a period of economic depression that lasted through the 1970s. The loss of jobs created numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

Mobile's city commission form of government was challenged and finally overturned in 1982 in ''[[City of Mobile v. Bolden]]'', which was remanded by the [[United States Supreme Court]] to the district court. Finding that the city had adopted a commission form of government in 1911 and [[at-large]] positions with discriminatory intent, the court proposed that the three members of the city commission should be elected from [[single-member districts]], likely ending their division of executive functions among them. Mobile's state legislative delegation in 1985 finally enacted a [[mayor-council]] form of government, with seven members elected from [[single-member districts]]. This was approved by voters.<ref name="vra"/> As white conservatives increasingly entered the Republican Party in the late 20th century, African-American residents of the city have elected members of the Democratic Party as their candidates of choice.

Since 1985 the government of Mobile has consisted of a mayor and a seven-member [[city council]].<ref name="Cityofficials1">{{cite web |title=City Officials |work=City of Mobile |url=http://www.cityofmobile.org/cityofficials/ |access-date=November 23, 2012}}</ref> The mayor is elected [[at-large]], and the council members are elected from each of the seven city council [[single-member districts]] (SMDs). A [[supermajority]] of five votes is required to conduct council business.

This form of city government was chosen by the voters after the previous form of government, which had three city commissioners, each elected at-large, was ruled in 1975 to substantially dilute the minority vote and violate the [[Voting Rights Act]] in ''[[Mobile v. Bolden|Bolden v. City of Mobile]]''. The three at-large commissioners each required a majority vote to win. Due to appeals, the case took time to reach settlement and establishment of a new electoral system.<ref name="gov1">Thomason, Michael.
