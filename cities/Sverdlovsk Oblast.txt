'''Sverdlovsk Oblast''' ({{lang-rus|Свердловская область|p=svʲɪrdˈlofskəjə ˈobləsʲtʲ}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] (an [[oblast]]) of Russia located in the [[Ural Federal District]]. Its [[administrative center]] is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Yekaterinburg]], formerly known as Sverdlovsk. Its population is 4,268,998 (according to the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]]).<ref name="2021Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref>

==Geography==
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
[[File:Yekaterinburg Border Asia Europe.jpg|thumb|left|Landmark indicating the border between Europe and Asia in Sverdlovsk Oblast.]]
Most of the oblast is spread over the eastern slopes of the Middle and North Urals and the [[Western Siberian Plain]]. Only in the southwest does the oblast stretch onto the western slopes of the [[Ural Mountains]].

The highest mountains all rise in the North Urals, Konzhakovsky Kamen at {{convert|1569|m|ft}} and Denezhkin Kamen at {{convert|1492|m|ft}}. The Middle Urals is mostly hilly country with no discernible peaks; the mean elevation is closer to {{convert|300|to|500|m|ft}} above sea level.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Russia: Impact of Climate Change to 2030 |url=https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/climate2030_russia.pdf |access-date=April 25, 2023}}</ref> Principal rivers include the [[Tavda River|Tavda]], the [[Tura River|Tura]], the [[Chusovaya River|Chusovaya]], and the [[Ufa River|Ufa]], the latter two being tributaries of the [[Kama River|Kama]].

Sverdlovsk Oblast borders with, clockwise from the west, [[Perm Krai]], the [[Komi Republic]], [[Khanty–Mansi Autonomous Okrug]], [[Tyumen Oblast]], [[Kurgan Oblast|Kurgan]], and [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]]s, and the [[Republic of Bashkortostan]].

The area is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

===Natural resources===
Rich in natural resources, the oblast is especially famous for metals ([[iron]], [[copper]], [[gold]], [[platinum]]), minerals ([[asbestos]], [[gemstone]]s, [[talcum]]), [[marble]] and [[coal]]. It is mostly here that the bulk of Russian industry was concentrated in the 18th and 19th centuries.

===Climate===
The area has [[continental climate]] patterns, with long cold winters (average temperatures reaching {{convert|-15|C}} to {{convert|-25|C}} on the Western Siberian Plain) and short warm summers. Only in the southeast of the oblast do temperatures reach {{convert|+30|C}} in July.

===Early history===
[[File:Большой_шигирский_идол.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.6|Wooden sculpture dated to 11,500 years ago may have stood more than 5 m high]]
The territory of the region has been inhabited since ancient times. Numerous sites of ancient people were discovered, dating from the Paleolithic to the Iron Age. The Upper Paleolithic includes the Garinsky site on the right bank of the [[Sosva (river)|Sosva river]] near the village of [[Gari, Sverdlovsk Oblast|Gari]], the site in the Shaitansky grotto, and the site in the Bezymyanny cave (X millennium BC).<ref>''Сериков Ю.

A settlement and a burial ground in the Kalmatsky Brod tract are located on the right bank of the [[Iset (river)|Iset river]] and date back to the Sarmatian time (from the 3rd century BC to the 2nd century AD). They belong to the Kalmak archaeological culture. In the Kalmatsky Brod burial ground, the skeletal skulls were strongly deformed by tight bandaging in early childhood, which indicates the penetration of steppe ethnic elements to the north.<ref name="Сальников52">''Сальников К.

===Medieval history and Russian expansion===
Before the first Russian colonists arrived to the region, it was populated by various [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] and [[Ugrian]] tribes. By the 16th century, when the Middle Urals were under influence of various [[Tatar]] khanates, the strongest local state was the [[Vogul]] Pelym principality with its center in [[Pelym, Garinsky District, Sverdlovsk Oblast|Pelym]].

The Russian conquest of the [[Khanate of Kazan]] in the 1550s paved the way further east, which was now free from Tatar depredations (see [[Yermak Timofeyevich]]). The first surviving Russian settlements in the area date back to the late 16th{{snd}}early 17th centuries ([[Verkhoturye]], 1598; [[Turinsk]], 1600; [[Irbit]], 1633; [[Alapayevsk]], 1639). At that time, those small trading posts were governed under [[Siberia]]n administration in [[Tobolsk]]. After the 1708 administrative reform, Verkhoturye, Pelym and Turinsk became a part of the new [[Siberian Governorate]], in 1737 their territories were assigned to the [[Kazan Governorate]]. [[file:Verkhoturye 1910 LOC prok 02108.jpg|thumb|Verkhoturye in 1910]]

===Rise of the mining-metallurgical era===
During the 18th century, rich resources of iron and coal made Ural an industrial heartland of Russia. After getting control over Ural mines, the [[Demidov]] family put the region in the forefront of Russian industrialization. [[Yekaterinburg]], [[Nevyansk]] and [[Nizhny Tagil|Tagil]] ironworks, founded in the 1700s to 1720s, soon joined the ranks of the major producers in Europe. Throughout the 18th and 19th century those newly founded factory towns enjoyed a status of special mining-metallurgical districts allowed to have a certain rate of financial and proprietary autonomy. During the 1781 reform middle Ural finally got its own regional administration in the form of the [[Perm Governorate]].

When in 1812 the Russian government legalized gold digging for its citizens, Middle Ural became a center of gold mining. Entrepreneurs of the Perm Governorate also started the gold rush in West Siberia, soon Yekaterinburgers began to dominate the Russian market of precious metals and gemstones.

After the [[emancipation reform of 1861]], major Middle Uralian industries that were heavily dependent on serf labor entered decline, although it also allowed light industry to thrive. In 1878, [[Perm, Russia|Perm]] and Yekaterinburg were connected with a railroad, in 1888, railroads reached [[Tyumen]], and ultimately, in 1897, Yekaterinburg joined the [[Trans-Siberian Railway|Trans-Siberian network]]. Emergence of railroad transportation helped to revitalize economy of Ural.

===Soviet Ural===
The [[Bolsheviks]] established their power in Yekaterinburg and Perm during the first days of the [[October Revolution]] of 1917. In early 1918 the dethroned Czar [[Nicholas II]] and his family were transferred under custody to Yekaterinburg. Local Bolsheviks decided autonomously to [[Shooting of the Romanov family|execute the royal family]] on July 17, 1918, to prevent its rescue of by the approaching [[White movement|White Army]] forces. Ten days later Yekaterinburg was captured by the [[Czechoslovak Legion|Czechoslovak troops]] of [[Sergei Wojciechowski]]. For the next year the Anti-bolshevik forces took control over the region. On 19 August 1918, Provisional Government of Ural was formed in Yekaterinburg by a coalition of liberal and democratic socialist parties, it was supposed to serve as a buffer between the [[Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly|Komuch]] and [[Provisional Siberian Government (Omsk)|Provisional Siberian]] governments. After the [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak]] coup d'état in Omsk in November 1918, the Government of Ural was disbanded.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

In July 1919, in the course of the Yekaterinburg offense, Yekaterinburg and the surrounding areas were recaptured by the [[Red Army]] forces under command of [[Vasily Shorin]]. On the July 15th, the Perm Governorate was split by the Soviets and the east, for the first time in history, became a separate region, the Yekaterinburg Governorate. It was soon abolished and replaced by the [[Ural Oblast (1923–1934)|Ural Oblast]] (1923-1934).{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

[[File:RIAN archive 1274 Tanks going to the front.jpg|thumb|left|T-34 tanks on the conveyor belt of the [[Uralmash]] plant (1942)]]
In the 1930s many industrial enterprises were established and built with the help of forced labour.<ref>V.A. Kravchenko: I chose freedom (1946)</ref> Local industry received another impetus during World War II, when important producing facilities were relocated here from the European part of Russia to safeguard them from the advancing Germans (for example, [[IMZ-Ural]], [[Kamensk-Uralsky Metallurgical Works]]). In the postwar period much of the region was off-limits to foreigners. It was over Sverdlovsk that the [[1960 U-2 incident|American U-2 spy plane]] pilot [[Gary Powers]] was shot down on May 1, 1960, while on a reconnaissance mission.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

In 1979, there was an [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak|anthrax outbreak]] caused by an accident in a facility to develop biological weapons.{{Citation needed|date=October 2024}}

===Post-Soviet transition===
In 1993, Governor [[Eduard Rossel]] responded to perceived economic inequality by attempting to create a "[[Ural Republic]]." Sverdlovsk led the "Urals Five" ([[Kurgan Oblast]], [[Orenburg Oblast]], [[Perm Krai]], [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] and Sverdlovsk) in a call for greater regional power. They argued that the [[Oblasts of Russia|oblasts]] deserved as much power as the ethnic homeland [[Republics of Russia|republics]]. The Urals Republic Constitution went into effect on October 27, 1993. Then Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] dissolved the Urals Republic and the Sverdlovsk Parliament 10 days later (on November 9).

==Politics==
[[image:Zak Sobranie SverdlOblasti.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Legislative Assembly of Sverdlovsk Oblast]]]]
The oblast's Charter, adopted on 17 December 1994, with subsequent amendments, establishes the oblast government. The [[Governor of Sverdlovsk Oblast|Governor]] is the chief executive, who appoints the Government, consisting of ministries and departments. The Chairman of the Government, commonly referred to as the Prime Minister, is appointed with the consent of the lower house of the [[legislature]], a process similar to the appointment of the [[Prime Minister of Russia|federal Prime Minister]]. But the Governor cannot nominate the same candidate more than twice, yet he/she can dismiss the house after three failed attempts to appoint the Premier.{{update inline|date=June 2023}}

The [[Legislative Assembly of Sverdlovsk Oblast|Legislative Assembly]] is the [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]] of Sverdlovsk Oblast. Until 2011, it was a [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature consisting of the Oblast Duma, the [[lower house]], and the House of Representatives, the [[upper house]].<ref name="h">[http://old.zsso.ru/about Formation of the legislative body of Sverdlovsk Oblast], ''old.zsso.ru''</ref> Before the reform, members of the legislature served four-year terms with half of the Duma re-elected every two years. The Duma (28&nbsp;members) was elected in party lists. The 21&nbsp;members of the House of Representatives were elected in single-seat districts in a [[first-past-the-post]] system. The Legislative Assembly was the first bicameral legislature outside an autonomous republic, and the first regional legislature in Russia to elect members based on both [[party list]]s and [[Single-member district|single-seat districts]]. As of 2021, the Legislative Assembly is a [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] legislature with a total of 50 seats, with half of the members elected by single-mandate constituencies and the other half elected in party lists for five-year terms.<ref>[http://zsso.ru/about/general General information], ''zsso.ru''</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://council.gov.ru/structure/regions/SVE|title=Свердловская область|website=council.gov.ru}}</ref> 

Compliance with the Charter is enforced by the Charter Court. The existence of such regional courts in Russia, formed and functioning outside the federal judiciary, although challenged, has been upheld and persisted successfully in most constituent members of the Federation where they were established.

Until President [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]]'s reforms of 2004, the Governor was elected by direct vote for terms of four years. [[Eduard Rossel]] has been the only elected governor (first elected governor for an oblast in Russia) since 1995 (appointed in 1991 and dismissed in 1993 by President [[Boris Yeltsin|Yeltsin]]), re-elected in 1999 and 2003.

===Elections===
In the 1990s, the Oblast's population was distinguished by relatively high support for parties and candidates of the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[democracy|democratic]] persuasion. In the 1996 presidential election, [[Boris Yeltsin]], a native of the region who lived in Sverdlovsk until the 1980s, won over 70% of the vote. In the regional elections in 2010 in the Sverdlovsk Oblast, [[United Russia]] received minimal support relative to other regions - only 39.79% of votes.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.gazeta.ru/politics/2010/03/18_a_3340148.shtml |title=Результат единороссов по Свердловской области был самым худшим для партии власти |trans-title=The result of United Russia in the Sverdlovsk region was the worst for the ruling party |access-date=2011-01-02 |archive-date=2010-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100610063722/http://gazeta.ru/politics/2010/03/18_a_3340148.shtml |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Economy and transportation==

Even though it could do with modernizing, the region's industries are quite diverse. 12% of Russia's iron and steel industry is still concentrated in Sverdlovsk oblast. Iron and copper are mined and processed here, the logging industry and wood-processing are important, too.

The largest companies in the region include [[Ural Mining and Metallurgical Company]], [[UralVagonZavod]], [[Enel Russia]], [[Nizhniy Tagil Iron and Steel Works]], [[Federal Freight]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sverdlovsk region Industries |url=https://www.investinregions.ru/en/regions/sverdlovsk/industries/ |website=investinregions.ru |access-date=7 November 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

===Transport===
[[Yekaterinburg]] is a prominent [[Transport hub|road, rail and air hub]] in the Ural region. As the economic slump subsided, several European airlines started or resumed flights to the city. These include [[Lufthansa]], [[British Airways]], [[Czech Airlines|CSA]], [[Turkish Airlines]], [[Austrian Airlines]] and [[Finnair]]. [[Malév Hungarian Airlines]] used to be among those carriers but they had to drop their flights to SVX ([[IATA airport code]] for Sverdlovsk) after a few months.

The [[Alapaevsk narrow-gauge railway]] serves the communities around [[Alapayevsk]].
