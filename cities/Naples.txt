Founded by Greeks in the [[1st millennium BC|first millennium]] BC, Naples is one of the oldest continuously inhabited urban areas in the world. In the eighth century BC, a colony known as Parthenope ({{langx|grc|Παρθενόπη}}) was established on the Pizzofalcone hill. In the sixth century BC, it was refounded as Neápolis.<ref>Daniela Giampaola, Francesca Longobardo (2000). ''Naples Greek and Roman''.

Naples served as the capital of the [[Duchy of Naples]] (661–1139), subsequently as the capital of the [[Kingdom of Naples]] (1282–1816), and finally as the capital of the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] — until the [[Italian unification|unification of Italy]] in 1861. Naples is also considered a capital of the [[Baroque]], beginning with the artist [[Caravaggio]]'s career in the 17th century and the artistic revolution he inspired.<ref>Alessandro Giardino (2017), ''Corporeality and Performativity in Baroque Naples.

Since the late 20th century, Naples has had significant economic growth, helped by the construction of the [[Centro Direzionale (Naples)|Centro Direzionale]] business district and an advanced transportation network, which includes the [[Treno Alta Velocità|Alta Velocità]] high-speed rail link to Rome and [[Salerno]] and an expanded [[Naples Metro|subway network]].

Naples' historic city centre has been designated as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]. A wide range of culturally and historically significant sites are nearby, including the [[Palace of Caserta]] and the Roman ruins of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]].

In 1191 Henry invaded Sicily after being crowned as [[Henry VI, Holy Roman Emperor]], and many cities surrendered. Still, Naples resisted him from May to August under the leadership of [[Richard, Count of Acerra]], [[Nicholas of Ajello]], [[Aligerno Cottone]] and [[Margaritus of Brindisi]] before the Germans suffered from disease and were forced to retreat. [[Conrad II, Duke of Bohemia]] and [[Philip I, Archbishop of Cologne]] died of disease during [[Siege of Naples (1191)|the siege]]. During his counterattack, [[Tancred, King of Sicily|Tancred]] captured Constance, now empress. He had the empress imprisoned at [[Castel dell'Ovo]] at Naples before her release on May 1192 under the pressure of [[Pope Celestine III]].

Naples' 2,800-year history has left it with a wealth of historical buildings and monuments, from medieval castles to classical ruins, and a wide range of culturally and historically significant sites nearby, including the [[Palace of Caserta]] and the Roman ruins of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]].

=== Piazzas, palaces and castles ===
{{See also|Category:Palaces in Naples|label 1=List of palaces in Naples}}
[[File:CastelOvo.jpg|thumb|The [[Castel dell'Ovo|Egg Castle]]]]
The main city square or ''[[piazza]]'' of the city is the [[Piazza del Plebiscito]]. Its construction was begun by the [[Bonapartism|Bonapartist]] king [[Joachim Murat]] and finished by the Bourbon king [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]]. The piazza is bounded on the east by the [[Royal Palace (Naples)|Royal Palace]] and on the west by the church of [[San Francesco di Paola (Naples)|San Francesco di Paola]], with the colonnades extending on both sides. Nearby is the [[Teatro di San Carlo]], which is the oldest [[opera house]] in Italy. Directly across San Carlo is [[Galleria Umberto I|Galleria Umberto]].

Naples is well known for its castles: The most ancient is [[Castel dell'Ovo]] ("Egg Castle"), which was built on the tiny [[islet]] of Megarides, where the original [[Cumae]]an colonists had founded the city. In Roman times the islet became part of [[Lucullus]]'s villa, later hosting [[Romulus Augustulus]], the exiled last western Roman emperor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comune.napoli.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1433 |title=Cultura – Il castel dell'ovo |access-date=9 August 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814033557/http://www.comune.napoli.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1433 |archive-date=14 August 2013}}</ref> It had also been the prison for [[Constance, Queen of Sicily|Empress Constance]] between 1191 and 1192 after her being captured by Sicilians, and [[Conradin]] and [[Giovanna I of Naples]] before their executions.

[[Castel Nuovo]], also known as ''Maschio [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angioino]]'', is one of the city's top landmarks; it was built during the time of [[Charles I of Naples|Charles I]], the first [[List of monarchs of Naples|king of Naples]]. Castel Nuovo has seen many notable historical events: for example, in 1294, [[Pope Celestine V]] resigned as pope in a hall of the castle, and following this [[Pope Boniface VIII]] was elected pope by the cardinal [[Collegium (ancient Rome)|collegium]], before moving to Rome.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comune.napoli.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1372 |title=Cultura – Patrimonio Artistico e Museale – Castel Nuovo |access-date=9 April 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112011805/http://www.comune.napoli.it/flex/cm/pages/ServeBLOB.php/L/IT/IDPagina/1372 |archive-date=12 January 2012}}</ref>

[[Castel Capuano]] was built in the 12th century by [[William I of Sicily|William I]], the son of [[Roger II of Sicily]], the first monarch of the [[Kingdom of Naples]]. It was expanded by [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]] and became one of his royal palaces. The castle was the residence of many kings and queens throughout its history. In the 16th century, it became the Hall of Justice.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fondazionecastelcapuano.it/storia.aspx |title=Fondazione Castel Capuano |access-date=10 July 2018 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180710195335/http://www.fondazionecastelcapuano.it/storia.aspx |archive-date=10 July 2018}}</ref>

Another Neapolitan castle is [[Castel Sant'Elmo]], which was completed in 1329 and is built in the shape of a [[star]]. Its strategic position overlooking the entire city made it a target of various invaders. During the uprising of [[Masaniello]] in 1647, the Spanish took refuge in Sant'Elmo to escape the revolutionaries.<ref>Giuseppe Grispello, Il mistero di Castel Sant'Elmo, Napoli, Guida, 1999, {{ISBN|88-7188-322-5}}.</ref>

The [[Carmine Castle]], built in 1392 and highly modified in the 16th century by the Spanish, was demolished in 1906 to make room for the Via Marina, although two of the castle's towers remain as a monument. The Vigliena Fort, built in 1702, was destroyed in 1799 during the royalist war against the Parthenopean Republic and is now abandoned and in ruin.<ref>Ruggiero Gennaro, I castelli di Napoli, Napoli, Newton & Compton, 1995, {{ISBN|88-7983-760-5}}.</ref>

Previously a Bourbon palace, now a museum and art gallery, the [[Museo di Capodimonte]] is another museum of note. The [[List of works in the Galleria Nazionale di Capodimonte|gallery features paintings]] from the 13th to the 18th centuries, including major works by [[Simone Martini]], [[Raphael]], [[Titian]], [[Caravaggio]], [[El Greco]], [[Jusepe de Ribera]] and [[Luca Giordano]]. The royal apartments are furnished with antique 18th-century furniture and a collection of [[porcelain]] and [[Victorian majolica|majolica]] from the various royal residences: the famous [[Capodimonte porcelain|Capodimonte Porcelain Factory]] once stood just adjacent to the palace.

In front of the [[Royal Palace of Naples]] stands the [[Galleria Umberto I]], which contains the [[Coral Jewellery Museum]]. Occupying a 19th-century palazzo renovated by the Portuguese architect [[Álvaro Siza]], the [[Museo d'Arte Contemporanea Donnaregina]] (MADRE) features an [[enfilade]] procession of permanent installations by artists such as [[Francesco Clemente]], [[Richard Serra]], and [[Rebecca Horn]].<ref>Aric Chen (18 September 2005).

Aside from the Piazza del Plebiscito, Naples has two other major public squares: the [[Piazza Dante (Naples)|Piazza Dante]] and the [[Piazza dei Martiri]]. The latter originally had only a memorial to religious [[martyr]]s, but in 1866, after the [[Italian unification]], four lions were added, representing the four rebellions against the Bourbons.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.inaples.it/ita/dettaglio.asp?idp=92&cod=65 |publisher=INaples.it |title=Piazza Dei Martiri |date=8 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722035628/http://www.inaples.it/ita/dettaglio.asp?idp=92&cod=65 |archive-date=22 July 2011 |access-date=1 March 2008}}</ref>

The [[San Gennaro dei Poveri]] is a Renaissance-era hospital for the poor, erected by the Spanish in 1667. It was the forerunner of a much more ambitious project, the [[Ospedale L'Albergo Reale dei Poveri, Naples|Bourbon Hospice for the Poor]] started by [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]]. This was for the destitute and ill of the city; it also provided a self-sufficient community where the poor would live and work. Though a notable landmark, it is no longer a functioning hospital.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ceva Grimaldi |first=Francesco |author-link=Francesco Ceva Grimaldi (historian) |title=Della città di Napoli dal tempo della sua fondazione sino al presente |publisher=Stamperia e calcografia |year=1857 |url=https://archive.org/details/dellacittdinapo01grimgoog |page=[https://archive.org/details/dellacittdinapo01grimgoog/page/n530 521] |quote=Albergo Reale dei Poveri napoli. |access-date=14 February 2013}}</ref>

==== Subterranean Naples ====
[[File:Galleria borbonica - War refuge (Naples).jpg|thumb|[[Naples underground geothermal zone|Underground Naples]]]]
{{Main|Beneath Naples|Catacombs of San Gennaro|Catacombs of Saint Gaudiosus|San Pietro ad Aram}}
[[Naples underground geothermal zone|Underneath Naples]] lies a series of caves and structures created by centuries of mining, and the city rests atop a major [[Geothermal activity|geothermal]] zone. There are also several ancient [[Greco-Roman]] reservoirs dug out from the soft [[tuff|tufo stone]] on which, and from which, much of the city is built. Approximately {{convert|1|km|spell=in|abbr=off}} of the many kilometres of tunnels under the city can be visited from the [[Naples underground geothermal zone|Napoli Sotteranea]], situated in the historic centre of the city in [[Via dei Tribunali (Naples)|Via dei Tribunali]]. This system of tunnels and cisterns underlies most of the city and lies approximately {{convert|30|m|ft}} below ground level. During [[World War II]], these tunnels were used as [[air-raid shelter]]s, and there are inscriptions on the walls depicting the suffering endured by the refugees of that era.

There are large [[Catacombs of San Gennaro|catacombs]] in and around the city, and other landmarks such as the [[Piscina Mirabilis]], the main cistern serving the [[Bay of Naples]] during Roman times.

Several archaeological excavations are also present; they revealed in [[San Lorenzo Maggiore, Naples|San Lorenzo Maggiore]] the [[macellum of Naples]], and in [[Santa Chiara, Naples|Santa Chiara]], the biggest thermal complex of the city in Roman times.

==== Parks, gardens, villas, fountains and stairways ====
{{Main|Villas in Naples|Stairways in Naples|List of fountains in Naples}}
[[File:FantanaSantaLucia2.jpg|thumb|[[Villa Comunale]]]]
Of the various [[park|public parks]] in Naples, the most prominent are the [[Villa Comunale]], which was built by the Bourbon king [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] in the 1780s;<ref>{{cite news |url=http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/blog19.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030829022247/http://faculty.ed.umuc.edu/~jmatthew/naples/blog19.htm |archive-date=29 August 2003 |publisher=Faculty.ed.umuc.edu |title=Villa Comunale |date=8 January 2008}}</ref> the park was originally a "Royal Garden", reserved for members of the royal family, but open to the public on special holidays. The Bosco di [[Palace of Capodimonte|Capodimonte]], the city's largest green space, served as a royal hunting reserve. The Park has 16 additional historical buildings, including residences, lodges, churches, fountains, statues, orchards and woods.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.museocapodimonte.beniculturali.it/information-en/ |title=Information en |access-date=13 July 2018 |archive-date=5 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210605153709/http://www.museocapodimonte.beniculturali.it/information-en/ |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==== Neo-Gothic, ''Liberty Napoletano'' and modern architecture ====
[[File:Napoli - Castello Aselmeyer.jpg|left|thumb|Aselmeyer Castle, built by [[Lamont Young (Naples)|Lamont Young]] in the Neo-Gothic style]]
[[File:Liberty Napoli.jpg|thumb|One of the city's various examples of ''Liberty Napoletano'']]
Various buildings inspired by the [[Gothic Revival Architecture|Gothic Revival]] are extant in Naples, due to the influence that this movement had on the Scottish-Indian architect [[Lamont Young (Naples)|Lamont Young]], one of the most active Neapolitan architects of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Young left a significant footprint in the [[cityscape]] and designed many urban projects, such as the city's first subway ([[Naples Metro|metro]]).

In the first years of the 20th century, a local version of the [[Art Nouveau]] phenomenon, known as "[[Liberty style|Liberty]] Napoletano", developed in the city, creating many buildings which still stand today. In 1935, the [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalist]] architect Luigi Cosenza designed a new fish market for the city. During the [[Benito Mussolini]] era, the first structures of the city's "service center" were built, all in a Rationalist-[[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] style, including the Palazzo delle Poste and the Pretura buildings.

[[File:Napoli 2.jpg|thumb|The [[Gulf of Naples]]]]
The city is situated on the [[Gulf of Naples]], on the western coast of [[southern Italy]]; it rises from sea level to an elevation of {{convert|450|m|ft}}. The small rivers that formerly crossed the city's centre have since been covered by construction. It lies between two notable [[volcanic]] regions, [[Mount Vesuvius]] and the [[Campi Flegrei]] (''Phlegraean Fields''). Campi Flegrei is considered a [[supervolcano]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Europe's super volcano |url=https://www.dw.com/en/europes-super-volcano/av-60510172 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |date=21 January 2022 |access-date=22 January 2023 |archive-date=29 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220829194448/https://www.dw.com/en/europes-super-volcano/av-60510172 |url-status=live }}</ref> The islands of [[Procida]], [[Capri]] and [[Ischia]] can all be reached from Naples by [[hydrofoil]]s and ferries. [[Sorrento, Italy|Sorrento]] and the [[Amalfi Coast]] are situated south of the city. At the same time, the Roman ruins of [[Pompeii]], [[Herculaneum]], [[Oplontis]] and [[Stabiae]], which were destroyed in the [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD]], are also visible nearby. The port towns of [[Pozzuoli]] and [[Baiae|Baia]], which were part of the Roman naval facility of [[Portus Julius]], lie to the west of the city.

Summers feature high temperatures and humidity.

Winters are mild, and snow is rare in the city area but frequent on [[Mount Vesuvius]]. November is the wettest month in Naples, while July is the driest.

=== Governance ===
Each of the 7,896 ''[[comune]]'' in Italy is today represented locally by a [[city council]] headed by an elected mayor, known as a ''sindaco'' and informally called the first citizen (''primo cittadino''). This system, or one very similar to it, has been in place since the invasion of Italy by [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleonic]] forces in 1808. When the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] was restored, the system was kept in place with members of the nobility filling mayoral roles. By the end of the 19th century, [[political party|party politics]] had begun to emerge; during the [[Italian Fascism|fascist era]], each commune was represented by a ''podestà''. Since [[World War II]], the political landscape of Naples has been neither strongly right-wing nor left-wing – both [[Christian democracy|Christian democrats]] and [[democratic socialism|democratic socialists]] have governed the city at different times, with roughly equal frequency. Since the early 1990s, the mayors of Naples have all belonged to left-wing or center-left political groups. 

Since 2021, the mayor of Naples is [[Gaetano Manfredi]], an [[independent politician]] candidated by the center-left coalition, former [[Italian Minister of University and Research|minister of university and research]] in the [[Conte II Cabinet|second Conte government]], and former rector of the [[University of Naples Federico II]].

Naples has long been a centre of art and architecture, dotted with Medieval-, Baroque- and Renaissance-era churches, castles and palaces. A critical factor in the development of the Neapolitan school of painting was Caravaggio's arrival in Naples in 1606. In the 18th century, Naples went through a period of [[neoclassicism]], following the discovery of the remarkably intact Roman ruins of [[Herculaneum]] and [[Pompeii]].

The [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Napoli|Neapolitan Academy of Fine Arts]], founded by [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III of Bourbon]] in 1752 as the Real Accademia di Disegno ([[English language|en]]: ''Royal Academy of Design''), was the centre of the artistic School of [[Posillipo]] in the 19th century. Artists such as [[Domenico Morelli]], [[Giacomo Di Chirico]], [[Francesco Saverio Altamura]] and [[Gioacchino Toma]] worked in Naples during this period, and many of their works are now exhibited in the academy's art collection. The modern Academy offers courses in painting, [[Interior design|decorating]], sculpture, design, [[Conservation-restoration|restoration]], and urban planning. Naples is also known for its theatres, which are among the oldest in Europe: the [[Teatro di San Carlo]] [[opera house]] dates back to the 18th century.

Naples is also the home of the artistic tradition of [[Capodimonte porcelain]]. In 1743, Charles of Bourbon founded the Royal Factory of Capodimonte, many of whose artworks are now on display in the [[Museum of Capodimonte]]. Several of Naples' mid-19th-century porcelain factories remain active today.

Naples is internationally famous for its [[Neapolitan cuisine|cuisine]] and wine; it draws culinary influences from the numerous cultures which have inhabited it throughout its history, including the [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], Spanish and French. Neapolitan cuisine emerged as a distinct form in the 18th century. The ingredients are typically rich in taste while remaining affordable to the general populace.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.italianfoodforever.com/iff/articles.asp?id=55 |publisher=ItalianFoodForever.com |title=The Foods of Sicily – A Culinary Journey |date=24 June 2007 |access-date=19 June 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080212090911/http://www.italianfoodforever.com/iff/articles.asp?id=55 |archive-date=12 February 2008}}</ref>

Naples is traditionally credited as the home of [[pizza]].<ref name="pizza" /> This originated as a meal of the poor, but under [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies|Ferdinand IV]] it became popular among the upper classes: famously, the [[Margherita (pizza)|Margherita]] pizza was named after Queen [[Margherita of Savoy]] after her visit to the city.<ref name="pizza">{{cite news |url=http://www.holidaycityflash.com/italy/pizza_naples.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619115409/http://www.holidaycityflash.com/italy/pizza_naples.htm |archive-date=19 June 2006 |publisher=HolidayCityFlash.com |title=Pizza – The Pride of Naples |date=8 January 2008 |access-date=24 June 2013}}</ref> Cooked traditionally in a wood-burning [[Masonry oven|oven]], the ingredients of Neapolitan pizza have been strictly regulated by law since 2004, and must include wheat flour type "00" with the addition of flour type "0" [[yeast]], natural mineral water, peeled tomatoes or fresh [[cherry tomato]]es, [[mozzarella]], [[sea salt]] and extra virgin [[olive oil]].<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.fornobravo.com/vera_pizza_napoletana/VPN_spec.html "Proposal of recognition of the Specialita' Traditionale Garantita 'Pizza Napoletana'"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208104542/http://www.fornobravo.com/vera_pizza_napoletana/VPN_spec.html |date=8 February 2009 }}.

=== Language ===
{{Main|Neapolitan language}}
The [[Neapolitan language]], considered to be a distinct language and mainly spoken in the city, is also found in the region of [[Campania]] and has been diffused into other areas of [[Southern Italy]] by Neapolitan migrants, and in many different places in the world. On 14 October 2008, a regional law was enacted by Campania which has the effect that the use of the Neapolitan language is protected.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denaro.it/VisArticolo.aspx?IdArt=548026 |title=Tutela del dialetto, primo via libera al Ddl campano |work=Il Denaro |date=15 October 2008 |access-date=22 June 2013 |language=it |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727043316/http://www.denaro.it/VisArticolo.aspx?IdArt=548026 |archive-date=27 July 2011}}</ref>

The term "Neapolitan language" is often used to describe the language of all of [[Campania]] (except [[Cilento]]), and is sometimes applied to the entire [[South Italian language]]; ''[[Ethnologue]]'' refers to the latter as ''Napoletano-Calabrese''.<ref name="Ethnologue Napoletano-Calabrese">{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nap |title=Ethnologue Napoletano-Calabrese |publisher=Ethnologue.com |access-date=13 March 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514001812/http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=nap |archive-date=14 May 2011}}</ref> This linguistic group is spoken throughout most of southern continental Italy, including the [[Gaeta]] and [[Sora, Italy|Sora]] district of southern [[Lazio]], the southern part of [[Marche]] and [[Abruzzo]], Molise, [[Basilicata]], northern [[Calabria]], and northern and central [[Apulia]]. In 1976, there were an estimated 7,047,399 [[first language|native speakers]] of this group of dialects.<ref name="Ethnologue Napoletano-Calabrese" />

Naples is one of the leading centres of [[Italian literature]]. The history of the Neapolitan language was deeply entwined with that of the [[Tuscan dialect]], which then became the current Italian language. The first written testimonies of the Italian language are the [[Placiti Cassinensi]] legal documents, dated 960 A.D., preserved in the [[Monte Cassino]] Abbey, which are, in fact, evidence of a language spoken in a southern dialect. The Tuscan poet [[Boccaccio]] lived for many years at the court of King [[Robert the Wise]] and his successor [[Joanna I of Naples|Joanna of Naples]], using Naples as a setting for ''[[The Decameron]]'' and a number of his later novels. His works contain some words that are taken from Neapolitan instead of the corresponding Italian, e.g. "''testo''" (neap.: "''testa''"), which in Naples indicates a large [[terracotta]] jar used to cultivate shrubs and little trees. King [[Alfonso V of Aragon]] stated in 1442 that the Neapolitan language was to be used instead of [[Latin]] in official documents.

In 1458 the ''[[Accademia Pontaniana]]'', one of the first academies in Italy, was established in Naples as a free initiative by men of letters, science and literature. In 1480 the writer and poet [[Jacopo Sannazzaro]] wrote the first pastoral romance, ''Arcadia'', which influenced Italian literature. In 1634 [[Giambattista Basile]] collected ''[[Pentamerone|Lo Cunto de li Cunti]]'' five books of ancient tales written in the Neapolitan dialect rather than Italian. Philosopher [[Giordano Bruno]], who theorised the existence of infinite solar systems and the infinity of the entire universe, completed his studies at the University of Naples. Due to philosophers such as [[Giambattista Vico]], Naples became one of the centres of the Italian peninsula for historical and [[philosophy of history]] studies.

[[Jurisprudence]] studies were enhanced in Naples thanks to eminent personalities of jurists like [[Bernardo Tanucci]], [[Gaetano Filangieri]] and [[Antonio Genovesi]]. In the 18th century Naples, together with [[Milan]], became one of the most important sites from which the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] penetrated Italy. Poet and philosopher [[Giacomo Leopardi]] visited the city in 1837 and died there. His works influenced [[Francesco de Sanctis]], who studied in Naples and eventually became Minister of Instruction during the Italian kingdom. De Sanctis was one of the first literary critics to discover, study and diffuse the poems and literary works of the great poet from [[Recanati]].

Writer and journalist [[Matilde Serao]] co-founded the newspaper [[Il Mattino]] with her husband [[Edoardo Scarfoglio]] in 1892. Serao was an acclaimed novelist and writer during her day. Poet [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]] was one of the most famous writers in the Neapolitan dialect, and many of his poems were adapted to music, becoming famous Neapolitan songs. In the 20th century, philosophers like [[Benedetto Croce]] pursued the long tradition of philosophy studies in Naples, and personalities like jurists and lawyer [[Enrico De Nicola]] pursued legal and constitutional studies. De Nicola later helped to draft the modern [[Constitution of the Italian Republic]] and was eventually elected to the office of President of the Italian Republic. Other noted Neapolitan writers and journalists include [[Antonio De Curtis]], [[Curzio Malaparte]], [[Giancarlo Siani]], [[Roberto Saviano]] and [[Elena Ferrante]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/6370/elena-ferrante-art-of-fiction-no-228-elena-ferrante |title=Elena Ferrante, Art of Fiction No. 228 |last=Ferri |first=Interviewed by Sandro and Sandra |journal=The Paris Review.

[[File:SAND Maurice Masques et bouffons 12.jpg|thumb|Engraving of [[Pulcinella]] in 1700|alt=|281x281px]]
Naples was one of the centres of the peninsula from which originated the modern theatre genre as nowadays intended, evolving from 16th century {{lang|it|[[commedia dell'arte]]}}. The masked character of [[Pulcinella]] is a worldwide famous figure either as a theatrical character or [[puppetry]] character.

The music Opera genre of {{lang|it|[[opera buffa]]}} was created in Naples in the 18th century and then spread to Rome and northern Italy. In the period of [[Belle Époque]], Naples rivalled Paris for its {{lang|fr|[[café-chantants]]}}, and many famous Neapolitan songs were originally created to entertain the public in the cafès of Naples. Perhaps the most well-known song is "Ninì Tirabusciò". The history of how this song was born was dramatised in the eponymous comedy movie "[[Ninì Tirabusciò: la donna che inventò la mossa]]" starring [[Monica Vitti]].

The Neapolitan popular genre of {{lang|it|[[sceneggiata]]}} is an important genre of modern folk theatre worldwide, dramatising common canon themes of thwarted love stories, comedies, tearjerker stories, commonly about honest people becoming [[camorra]] outlaws due to unfortunate events. The Sceneggiata became very popular amongst Neapolitans and eventually one of the best-known genres of Italian cinematography thanks to actors and singers like [[Mario Merola (singer)|Mario Merola]] and [[Nino D'Angelo]]. Many writers and playwrights, such as [[Raffaele Viviani]], wrote comedies and dramas for this genre. Actors and comedians like [[Eduardo Scarpetta]] and then his sons [[Eduardo De Filippo]], [[Peppino De Filippo]] and [[Titina De Filippo]] contributed to making the Neapolitan theatre. Its comedies and tragedies, such as "[[Filumena Marturano]]" and "[[Side Street Story|Napoli Milionaria]]", are well-known.

[[File:Totò, Neapolitan actor 1943.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Totò]], a famous Neapolitan actor]]
Naples has had a significant influence on [[Italian cinema]]. Because of the city's relevance, many films and television shows are set (entirely or partially) in Naples. In addition to serving as the backdrop for several movies and shows, many talented celebrities (actors, actresses, directors, and producers) are originally from Naples.

Naples was the location for several early Italian cinema masterpieces. ''[[Assunta Spina (1915 film)|Assunta Spina]]'' (1915) was a silent film adapted from a theatrical drama by Neapolitan writer [[Salvatore Di Giacomo]]. The film was directed by Neapolitan [[Gustavo Serena]]. Serena also starred in the 1912 film ''Romeo and Juliet''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.naplesldm.com/saldigiac.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150106181815/http://www.naplesldm.com/saldigiac.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 January 2015 |title=Salvatore Di Giacomo |last=Matthews |first=Jeff |website=naplesldm.com |access-date=23 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0784988/ |title=Gustavo Serena |website=IMDb |access-date=23 October 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170216191617/http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0784988/ |archive-date=16 February 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GITRwfip1R4C&q=gustavo+serena&pg=PA76 |title=Romeo and Juliet |last1=Shakespeare |first1=William |last2=Loehlin |first2=James N. |date=25 April 2002 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-66769-2 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Tailoring ===
[[Neapolitan tailoring]] was born as an attempt to loosen up the stiffness of English tailoring, which did not suit the Neapolitan lifestyle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://journal.styleforum.net/neapolitan-jacket-characteristics/ |website=journal.styleforum.net |author=Arianna Reggio |date=6 June 2017 |title=Your Guide to Neapolitan Jacket Characteristics |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905043251/http://journal.styleforum.net/neapolitan-jacket-characteristics/ |archive-date=5 September 2017 |access-date=5 September 2017}}</ref>
