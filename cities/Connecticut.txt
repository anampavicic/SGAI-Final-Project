Half of Connecticut was initially claimed by the Dutch colony [[New Netherland]], which included much of the land between the Connecticut and [[Delaware River|Delaware]] Rivers, although the first major settlements were established by the English around the same time. [[Thomas Hooker]] led a band of followers from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] to form the [[Connecticut Colony]], while other settlers from Massachusetts founded the [[Saybrook Colony]] and the [[New Haven Colony]]; both merged into the former by 1664.

Connecticut's official nickname, the "Constitution State", refers to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] adopted by the Connecticut Colony in 1639, which is considered by some to be the first written constitution in Western history.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://portal.ct.gov/csl/research/state-nicknames?language=en_US |title=Connecticut's Nicknames |website=CT.gov |access-date=May 5, 2024 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240101215401/https://portal.ct.gov/csl/research/state-nicknames?language=en_US |archive-date=January 1, 2024 |url-status=live }}</ref> As one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that rejected British rule during the [[American Revolution]], Connecticut was influential in the development of the [[federal government of the United States]].

Due to its geography, Connecticut has maintained a strong maritime tradition; the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] is located in [[New London, Connecticut|New London]] by the [[Thames River (Connecticut)|Thames River]].

The [[Pequot War]] marked the first major clash between colonists and Native Americans in New England. The Pequots reacted with increasing aggression to Colonial settlements in their territory—while simultaneously taking lands from the Narragansett and Mohegan tribes. Settlers responded to a murder in 1636 with a raid on a Pequot village on [[Block Island]]; the Pequots laid siege to Saybrook Colony's garrison that autumn, then raided Wethersfield in the spring of 1637. Colonists declared war on the Pequots, organized a band of militia and allies from the Mohegan and Narragansett tribes, and attacked a Pequot village on the [[Mystic River (Connecticut)|Mystic River]], with death toll estimates ranging between 300 and 700 Pequots.

=== Early statehood ===

Connecticut [[History of the United States Constitution#Ratification of the Constitution|ratified]] the [[Constitution of the United States|U.S. Constitution]] on January 9, 1788, becoming the fifth state.<ref name="AboutCT" />

The state prospered during the era following the American Revolution, as mills and textile factories were built and seaports flourished from trade<ref>{{cite book|last1=La Bella|first1=Laura|url={{google books|ZYJtf6CoCs4C|plainurl=yes|page=17}}|title=Connecticut: Past and Present|date=August 15, 2010|publisher=[[Rosen Publishing]]|location=New York|page=17|access-date=February 17, 2015}}</ref> and fisheries. After Congress established in 1790 the predecessor to the [[United States Revenue Cutter Service|U.S. Revenue Cutter Service]] that would evolve into the U.S. Coast Guard, President Washington assigned Jonathan Maltbie as one of seven masters to enforce customs regulations, with Maltbie monitoring the southern New England coast with a 48-foot [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] sloop named [[USRC Argus|''Argus'']].<ref>{{cite web|date=November 29, 2018|title=The Long Blue Line: Argus—first "Heritage" Class Offshore Patrol Cutter|url=https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2018/11/tlbl-argus-first-opc-namesake/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728223445/https://coastguard.dodlive.mil/2018/11/tlbl-argus-first-opc-namesake/|archive-date=July 28, 2020|access-date=April 18, 2020|website=Coast Guard Compass}}</ref>

In 1786, Connecticut ceded territory to the U.S. government that became part of the [[Northwest Territory]]. The state retained land extending across the northern part of present-day Ohio called the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]].<ref name="United States Summary 2010, page V-5">{{cite report|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf|title=User Notes by Table: Table 12|date=September 2010|publisher=United States Census Bureau|page=V-5|access-date=May 16, 2014|work=United States Summary: 2010, Population and Housing Unit Counts|archive-date=October 19, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019110435/http://www.census.gov/prod/cen2010/cph-2-1.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> The Western Reserve section was settled largely by people from Connecticut, and they brought Connecticut place names to Ohio.

Connecticut made agreements with Pennsylvania and New York which extinguished the land claims within those states' boundaries and created the [[Connecticut Panhandle]]. The state then ceded the Western Reserve in 1800 to the federal government,<ref name="United States Summary 2010, page V-5" /> which brought it to its present boundaries (other than minor adjustments with Massachusetts).

===19th century===
For the first time in 1800, Connecticut shipwrights launched more than 100 vessels in a single year. Over the following decade to the doorstep of renewed hostilities with Britain that sparked the War of 1812, Connecticut boatyards constructed close to 1,000 vessels, the most productive stretch of any decade in the 19th century.<ref name="auto"/>

During the war, the British launched raids in [[Stonington, Connecticut|Stonington]] and [[Essex, Connecticut|Essex]] and [[blockade]]d vessels in the Thames River. [[Derby, Connecticut|Derby]] native [[Isaac Hull]] became Connecticut's best-known naval figure to win renown during the conflict, as captain of the {{USS|Constitution}}.

The British blockade during the [[War of 1812]] hurt exports and bolstered the influence of Federalists who opposed the war.<ref>{{cite book |first1=James |last1=Boyland |first2=Glenn S. |last2=Gordinier |first3=Meredith |last3=Mason Brown |display-authors=etal |title=The Rockets' Red Glare: The War of 1812 and Connecticut |publisher=New London County Historical Society |year=2012 |isbn=978-0-9853-6240-9 }}</ref> The cessation of imports from Britain stimulated the construction of factories to manufacture textiles and machinery. Connecticut came to be recognized as a major center for manufacturing, due in part to the inventions of [[Eli Whitney]] and other early innovators of the [[Industrial Revolution]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Morris |first1=Charles R. |title=The Dawn of Innovation: The First American Industrial Revolution |date=2012 |publisher=[[PublicAffairs]] |page=136 |url={{Google books|n97K02J6eQgC|plainurl=yes|page=136}} |isbn=978-1-6103-9049-1 |access-date=February 17, 2015 }}</ref>

The war led to the development of fast [[clipper]]s that helped extend the reach of New England merchants to the Pacific and Indian oceans. The first half of the 19th century saw as well a rapid rise in whaling, with New London emerging as one of the New England industry's three biggest home ports after [[Nantucket, Massachusetts|Nantucket]] and [[New Bedford, Massachusetts|New Bedford]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Surowiecki |first1=John |date=March 1982 |title=A History of Connecticut's Coast |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CZIC-f94-s87-1982/html/CZIC-f94-s87-1982.htm |pages=15 |access-date=April 17, 2020 |journal= |archive-date=July 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728192854/https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CZIC-f94-s87-1982/html/CZIC-f94-s87-1982.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

The state was known for its political conservatism, typified by its Federalist party and the Yale College of [[Timothy Dwight IV|Timothy Dwight]]. The foremost intellectuals were Dwight and [[Noah Webster]],<ref>{{cite book |last=Elliott |first=Emory |title=Revolutionary Writers: Literature and Authority in the New Republic, 1725–1810 |date=1986 |orig-year=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=14 |url={{google books|WmI6avgH0GoC|plainurl=yes|page=14}} |access-date=February 17, 2015}}</ref> who compiled his great dictionary in New Haven. Religious tensions polarized the state, as the Congregational Church struggled to maintain traditional viewpoints, in alliance with the Federalists. The failure of the [[Hartford Convention]] in 1814 hurt the Federalist cause, with the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] gaining control in 1817.<ref>{{cite book |url = https://archive.org/stream/shortaccountofha00lyma#page/n1/mode/2up |last=Lyman |first=Theodore |title=A Short Account of the Hartford Convention |date=1823 |location=Boston |publisher=O.

Connecticut had been governed under the "[[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]]" since 1639, but the state adopted a new constitution in 1818.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/Content/constitutions/1818Constitution.htm |title=The Constitution of Connecticut (1818) |publisher=Connecticut General Assembly |access-date=May 16, 2014 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150504111454/http://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/Content/constitutions/1818Constitution.htm |archive-date=May 4, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====Civil War era====

Connecticut manufacturers played a major role in supplying the Union forces with weapons and supplies during the [[Union (American Civil War)|Civil War]]. The state furnished 55,000 men, formed into thirty full regiments of infantry, including two in the [[U.S. Colored Troops]], with several Connecticut men becoming generals. The Navy attracted 250 officers and 2,100 men, and Glastonbury native [[Gideon Welles]] was Secretary of the Navy. [[James H.

A surge of national unity in 1861 brought thousands flocking to the colors from every town and city. However, as the war became a crusade to end slavery, many Democrats (especially Irish Catholics) pulled back. The Democrats took a pro-slavery position and included many [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]] willing to let the South secede. The intensely fought 1863 election for governor was narrowly won by the Republicans.<ref>{{cite journal |first=Joanna D. |last=Cowden |title=The Politics of Dissent: Civil War Democrats in Connecticut |journal=New England Quarterly |date=December 1983 |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=538–554 |doi=10.2307/365104 |jstor=365104}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first=Jarlath Robert |last=Lane |title=A Political History of Connecticut During the Civil War |publisher=Catholic University of America Press |date=1941}}</ref>

====Second industrial revolution====

[[File:Connecticut1895.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|1895 map from [[Rand McNally]]]]

Connecticut's extensive industry, dense population, flat terrain, and wealth encouraged the construction of railroads starting in 1839.

The [[New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad]], called the ''New Haven'' or "The Consolidated", became the dominant Connecticut railroad company after 1872. [[J. P. Morgan]] began financing the major New England railroads in the 1890s, dividing territory so that they would not compete. The New Haven purchased 50 smaller companies, including steamship lines, and built a network of light rails (electrified trolleys) that provided inter-urban transportation for all of southern New England. By 1912, the New Haven operated over {{convert|2000|mile|km}} of track with 120,000 employees.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://doddcenter.uconn.edu/asc/findaids/NHRR_Smallformat/MSS19910133.html |title=New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Small Format Photograph and Postcard Collection |website=Archives & Special Collections at the Thomas J.

Connecticut shipyards would launch more than 165 steam-powered vessels in the 19th century.<ref name="auto"/>

The state enthusiastically supported the American war effort in 1917 and 1918 with large purchases of war bonds, a further expansion of industry, and an emphasis on increasing food production on the farms. Thousands of state, local, and volunteer groups mobilized for the war effort and were coordinated by the Connecticut State Council of Defense.<ref>{{cite journal |first=William J. |last=Breen |title=Mobilization and Cooperative Federalism: The Connecticut State Council of Defense, 1917-1919 |journal=Historian |date=1979 |volume=42 |issue=1 |pages=58–84 |doi=10.1111/j.1540-6563.1979.tb00574.x}}</ref> Manufacturers wrestled with manpower shortages; Waterbury's American Brass and Manufacturing Company was running at half capacity, so the federal government agreed to furlough soldiers to work there.{{sfn|Breen|1997|page=116}}

Connecticut's dependence on the defense industry posed an economic challenge at the end of the [[Cold War]]. The resulting budget crisis helped elect [[Lowell Weicker]] as governor on a third-party ticket in 1990.

The state capital and fourth largest city is [[Hartford]], and other major cities and towns (by population) include [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[New Haven]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]], [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]], [[Danbury, Connecticut|Danbury]], [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]], [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]. There are 169 [[New England town|incorporated towns]] in Connecticut, with cities and villages included within some towns.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2013|title=List of Connecticut Towns & Counties Including Year Established|url=https://ctstatelibrary.org/cttowns/counties|url-status=live|access-date=November 1, 2021|website=CT State Library|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105055255/http://ctstatelibrary.org:80/cttowns/counties |archive-date=November 5, 2015 }}</ref>

The highest peak in Connecticut is [[Bear Mountain (Connecticut)|Bear Mountain]] in [[Salisbury, Connecticut|Salisbury]] in the northwest corner of the state. The highest point is just east of where Connecticut, [[Massachusetts]], and New York meet (42°3′ N, 73°29′ W), on the southern slope of [[Mount Frissell]], whose peak lies nearby in Massachusetts.<ref>{{cite peakbagger |pid=7083 |name=Mount Frissell-South Slope, Connecticut/Massachusetts |url-status=dead |url=https://peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=7083 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231014192329/https://peakbagger.com/peak.aspx?pid=7083 |archive-date= Oct 14, 2023 }}</ref> At the opposite extreme, many of the coastal towns have areas that are less than {{convert|20|ft|m}} above sea level.

Connecticut has a long maritime history and a reputation based on that history—yet the state has no direct oceanfront (technically speaking). The coast of Connecticut sits on [[Long Island Sound]], which is an [[estuary]]. The state's access to the open Atlantic Ocean is both to the west (toward New York City) and to the east (toward the "race" near Rhode Island). Due to this unique geography, Long Island Sound and the Connecticut shoreline are relatively protected from high waves from storms.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Press Release: Scientists Find Block Island Sound Protected from Great Storms|url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/pr/95/18699.html|access-date=November 1, 2021|website=Columbia University }}</ref>

The [[Connecticut River]] cuts through the center of the state, flowing into Long Island Sound. The most populous metropolitan region centered within the state lies in the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Despite Connecticut's relatively small size, it features wide regional variations in its landscape; for example, in the northwestern [[Litchfield Hills]], it features rolling mountains and horse farms, whereas in areas to the east of New Haven along the coast, the landscape features coastal [[marsh]]es, [[beach]]es, and large scale maritime activities.

Connecticut's rural areas and small towns in the northeast and northwest corners of the state contrast sharply with its industrial cities such as Stamford, Bridgeport, and New Haven, located along the coastal highways from the New York border to New London, then northward up the Connecticut River to Hartford. Many towns in northeastern and northwestern Connecticut center around a [[Village green|green]]. Near the green typically stand historical visual symbols of [[New England]] towns, such as a white [[church (building)|church]], a [[colonial meeting house]], a colonial [[tavern]] or [[inn]], several [[American colonial architecture|colonial houses]], and so on, establishing a scenic historical appearance maintained for both [[historic preservation]] and tourism. Many of the areas in southern and coastal Connecticut have been built up and rebuilt over the years, and look less visually like traditional New England.

The northern boundary of the state with Massachusetts is marked by the Southwick Jog or Granby Notch, an approximately {{convert|2.5|mile|km}} square detour into Connecticut. The origin of this anomaly is clearly established in a long line of disputes and temporary agreements which were finally concluded in 1804, when southern [[Southwick, Massachusetts|Southwick's]] residents sought to leave Massachusetts, and the town was split in half.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/SouthwickMA_WebDocs/southwick_jog.pdf |title=The Southwick Jog |last=Dodge |first=Edward R. |website=Town of Southwick, Massachusetts |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929023040/http://www.southwickma.org/Public_Documents/F000102F9/S00476B50-00476B5B.0/The%20Southwick%20Jog.pdf |archive-date=September 29, 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |title=Connecticut's Southwick Jog |publisher=Connecticut State Library |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101024224307/http://www.cslib.org/jog.htm |archive-date=October 24, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The southwestern border of Connecticut where it abuts New York State is marked by a [[Salient (geography)|panhandle]] in [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] and the [[Western Connecticut Planning Region, Connecticut|Western Connecticut Planning Region]], containing the towns of [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]], [[New Canaan, Connecticut|New Canaan]], [[Darien, Connecticut|Darien]], and parts of [[Norwalk, Connecticut|Norwalk]] and [[Wilton, Connecticut|Wilton]]. This irregularity in the boundary is the result of [[History of Connecticut#Territorial disputes|territorial disputes]] in the late 17th century, culminating with New York giving up its claim to the area, whose residents considered themselves part of Connecticut, in exchange for an equivalent area extending northwards from [[Ridgefield, Connecticut|Ridgefield]] to the Massachusetts border, as well as undisputed claim to [[Rye (town), New York|Rye, New York]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |title=Connecticut's "Panhandle" |website=Connecticut State Library |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314055555/http://www.cslib.org/panhandle.htm |archive-date=March 14, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

{{further|Climate change in Connecticut}}
[[File:Köppen Climate Types Connecticut.png|left|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Connecticut, using 1991–2020 [[Climatological normal|climate normals]].]]
Connecticut lies at the rough transition zone between the southern end of the [[humid continental climate]], and the northern portion of the [[humid subtropical climate]]. Northern Connecticut generally experiences a climate with cold winters with moderate snowfall and hot, humid summers. Far southern and coastal Connecticut has a climate with cool winters with a mix of rain and infrequent snow, and the long hot and humid summers typical of the middle and lower [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].

By late May, the building [[Bermuda High]] creates a southerly flow of warm and humid tropical air, bringing hot weather conditions throughout the state. Average highs are {{convert|81|F|C}} in New London and {{convert|85|F|C}} in Windsor Locks at the peak of summer in late July. On occasion, heat waves with highs from 90 to {{convert|100|°F|°C|abbr=on}} occur across Connecticut.

Weather commonly associated with the fall season typically begins in October and lasts to the first days of December. Daily high temperatures in October and November range from the 50s to 60s (Fahrenheit) with nights in the 40s and upper 30s. Colorful foliage begins across northern parts of the state in early October and moves south and east reaching southeast Connecticut by early November. Far southern and coastal areas, however, have more oak and hickory trees (and fewer maples) and are often less colorful than areas to the north. By December daytime highs are in the 40s °F for much of the state, and average overnight lows are below freezing.

Winters (December through mid-March) are generally cold from south to north in Connecticut. The coldest month (January) has average high temperatures ranging from {{convert|38|F|C}} in the coastal lowlands to {{convert|33|F|C}} in the inland and northern portions on the state. The lowest temperature recorded in Connecticut is {{convert|-32|F|C}} which has been observed twice: in [[Falls Village, Connecticut|Falls Village]] on February 16, 1943, and in [[Coventry, Connecticut|Coventry]] on January 22, 1961.<ref name=":3" /> The average yearly snowfall ranges from about {{convert|60|in|mm}} in the higher elevations of the northern portion of the state to only {{convert|20-25|in|mm}} along the southeast coast of Connecticut (Branford to Groton). Generally, any locale north or west of [[Interstate 84 (Pennsylvania–Massachusetts)|Interstate 84]] receives the most snow, during a storm, and throughout the season. Most of Connecticut has less than 60 days of snow cover. Annually, 95% of seasonal snowfall in Connecticut falls from early December to late March in the northern part of the state, and from mid - December to early-March in the southern and coastal parts of the state.

During winter every few years, Connecticut can occasionally get heavy snowstorms, called [[nor'easter]]s, which may produce as much as two feet of snow on rare occasions.<ref name=":2" /><ref>{{Cite news|agency=Associated Press |first1=Lidia |last1=Ryan |first2=Frank |last2=Juliano |date=December 16, 2020|title=A look back at historic snow storms in Connecticut|url=https://www.ctpost.com/news/slideshow/A-look-back-at-historic-snow-storms-in-Connecticut-214396.php|url-status=live|access-date=November 1, 2021|website=Connecticut Post|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201217022008/https://www.ctpost.com/news/slideshow/A-look-back-at-historic-snow-storms-in-Connecticut-214396.php |archive-date=December 17, 2020 }}</ref> [[Ice storm]]s also occur on occasion, such as the [[Southern New England ice storm of 1973]] and the [[December 2008 Northeastern United States ice storm]].

{{See also|List of Connecticut tree species}}

Forests consist of a mix of [[Northeastern coastal forests]] of oak in southern areas of the state, to the upland [[New England-Acadian forests]] in the northwestern parts of the state. Mountain Laurel (''[[Kalmia latifolia]]'') is the state flower and is native to low ridges in several parts of Connecticut. Rosebay rhododendron (''[[Rhododendron maximum]]'') is also native to eastern uplands of Connecticut and [[Pachaug State Forest]] is home to the Rhododendron Sanctuary Trail. Atlantic white cedar (''[[Chamaecyparis thyoides]]''), is found in wetlands in the southern parts of the state. Connecticut has one native cactus (''[[Opuntia humifusa]]''), found in sandy coastal areas and low hillsides. Several types of beach grasses and wildflowers are also native to Connecticut.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Olson |first1=David M. |last2=Dinerstein |first2=Eric |last3=Wikramanayake |first3=Eric D. |display-authors=etal |title=Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal=[[BioScience]] |year=2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages=933–938 |doi= 10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:teotwa]2.0.co;2|issn=0006-3568|doi-access=free }}</ref> Connecticut spans [[USDA Plant Hardiness Zones]] 5b to 7a. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where more southern and subtropical plants are cultivated. In some coastal communities, ''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'' (southern magnolia), [[Lagerstroemia indica|crape myrtles]], scrub palms (''[[Sabal minor]]''), needle palms (''[[Rhapidophyllum hystrix]]''), and other broadleaved evergreens are cultivated in small numbers.{{Citation needed|reason=Since CT is far outside the native distribution, a reference is needed to support that this is happening in large enough numbers|date=July 2017}}

As of the [[2020 United States census]], Connecticut has a population of 3,605,944, an increase of 31,847 people (0.9%) from the [[2010 United States Census|2010 United States census]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|last=US Census Bureau|date=August 25, 2021|title=CONNECTICUT: 2020 Census|url=https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/connecticut-population-change-between-census-decade.html|url-status=live|access-date=October 16, 2021|website=Census.gov|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210831171323/https://www.census.gov/library/stories/state-by-state/connecticut-population-change-between-census-decade.html |archive-date=August 31, 2021 }}</ref> Among the census records, 20.4% of the population was under 18.

In 1790, 97% of the population in Connecticut was classified as "rural". The first census in which less than half the population was classified as rural was 1890. In the 2000 census, only 12.3% was considered rural.

The Jewish population is concentrated in the towns near Long Island Sound between [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], in [[Greater New Haven]] and in [[Greater Hartford]], especially the suburb of [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]]. According to the [[Association of Religion Data Archives]], the largest Christian denominations, by number of adherents, in 2010 were: the [[Catholic Church]], with 1,252,936; the [[United Church of Christ]], with 96,506; and non-denominational Evangelical Protestants, with 72,863.<ref name="www.thearda.com" />

Recent immigration has brought other non-Christian religions to the state, but the numbers of adherents of other religions are still low.

As of 2012, Connecticut residents had the second highest rate in the nation of combined state and local taxes after New York, at 12.6% of income compared to the national average of 9.9% as reported by the [[Tax Foundation]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://taxfoundation.org/publications/state-local-tax-burden-rankings/ |title=State-Local Tax Burden Rankings FY 2012 |website=The Tax Foundation |access-date=January 20, 2016 |archive-date=February 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202040355/https://taxfoundation.org/publications/state-local-tax-burden-rankings/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Before 1991, Connecticut had an investment-only [[income tax]] system. Income from employment was untaxed, but income from investments was taxed at 13%, the highest rate in the U.S., with no deductions allowed for costs of producing the investment income, such as interest on borrowing.

In 1991, under Governor [[Lowell P. Weicker Jr.]], an independent, the system was changed to one in which the taxes on employment income and investment income were equalized at a maximum rate of 4%. The new tax policy drew investment firms to Connecticut; {{as of|2019|lc=y}}, [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] was home to the headquarters for 16 of the 200 largest [[hedge fund]]s in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hfalert.com/documents/FG/hsp/hfa-rankings/597312_Top200Managers.pdf |title=Top 200 Hedge Fund Managers |website=Hedge Fund Alert |access-date=April 18, 2020 |archive-date=July 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728195228/https://www.hfalert.com/documents/FG/hsp/hfa-rankings/597312_Top200Managers.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

{{as of|2019}}, the income tax rates on Connecticut individuals were divided into seven tax brackets of 3% (on income up to $10,000); 5% ($10,000–$50,000); 5.5% ($50,000–$100,000); 6% ($100,000–$200,000); 6.5% ($200,000–$250,000); 6.9% ($250,000–$500,000); and 6.99% above $500,000, with additional amounts owed depending on the bracket.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tax-brackets.org/connecticuttaxtable |title=Connecticut Income Tax Brackets |website=Tax-Brackets.org |date=2019 |access-date=April 18, 2020 |archive-date=July 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702030756/https://www.tax-brackets.org/connecticuttaxtable |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{ Main | Agriculture in Connecticut }}
Connecticut's agricultural production totaled $580 million in 2017, with just over half of that revenue the result of [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery stock]] production. Milk production totaled $81 million that year, with other major product categories including [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[vegetables]] and [[fruit]], [[Connecticut shade tobacco|tobacco]] and [[shellfish]].<ref>{{cite report |title=2017 Census of Agriculture State Profile: Connecticut |url=https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/County_Profiles/Connecticut/cp99009.pdf |publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture |access-date=April 18, 2020 |date= |archive-date=July 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728210752/https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/AgCensus/2017/Online_Resources/County_Profiles/Connecticut/cp99009.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Energy===
{{See also|List of power stations in Connecticut}}
Connecticut's economy uses less energy to produce each dollar of GDP than all other states except California, Massachusetts, and New York. It uses less energy on a per-capita basis than all but six other states. It has no fossil-fuel resources, but does have renewable resources. Average retail electricity prices are the highest among the 48 contiguous states. While most of the state's energy consumption is generated using fossil fuels, [[nuclear power]] delivered over 40% of state's electricity generation in 2019. [[Refuse-derived fuel]]s and other [[biomass]] provided the largest share of renewable electricity at about a 3% share. Solar and wind generation have grown in recent years. More than three-quarters of solar generation came from distributed small-scale installations such as rooftop solar in 2019, and there is planning underway to significantly increase renewable generation with the state's offshore wind resource.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=CT |title=Connecticut State Profile and Energy Estimates – Profile Analysis |publisher=[[U.S. Energy Information Administration]] |access-date=March 16, 2021 |archive-date=March 21, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210321152628/https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=CT |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Q Bridge in New Haven Illuminated Red, White, and Blue (27460771747).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge (Connecticut)|Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge]], locally known as the '''Q{{nbsp}}Bridge''', carries ten lanes over the [[Quinnipiac River]] in [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], along the [[Connecticut Turnpike]].]]

The [[Interstate highway]]s in the state are [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|Interstate 95]] (I-95) traveling southwest to northeast along the coast, [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] traveling southwest to northeast in the center of the state, [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] traveling north to south in the center of the state, and [[Interstate 395 in Connecticut|I-395]] traveling north to south near the eastern border of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which together form [[Connecticut Route 15]] (Route 15), traveling from the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York City|New York]] parallel to I-95 before turning north of [[New Haven]] and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]]. I-95 and Route 15 were originally [[toll road]]s; they relied on a system of [[toll plaza]]s at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of major crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/ |title=Connecticut Turnpike (I-95) |website=NYC Roads |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-date=December 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204075835/http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Other major arteries in the state include [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|U.S. Route{{nbsp}}7]] (US{{nbsp}}7) in the west traveling parallel to the New York state line, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route{{nbsp}}8]] farther east near the industrial city of Waterbury and traveling north–south along the Naugatuck River Valley nearly parallel with US{{nbsp}}7, and [[Connecticut Route 9|Route{{nbsp}}9]] in the east.

Between New Haven and New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Although I-95 has been widened in several spots, some areas are only three lanes and this strains traffic capacity, resulting in frequent and lengthy [[rush hour]] delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway and even US{{nbsp}}1. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and [[carpool|ride-sharing]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ctrides.com/ways-to-commute/carpool |title=Ways to Commute |website=CT rides |publisher=State of Connecticut |access-date=July 25, 2010 |archive-date=August 18, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818092917/http://ctrides.com/ways-to-commute/carpool |url-status=live }}</ref>

Connecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycle ownership and use in the United States, particularly in New Haven. According to the U.S. Census 2006 American Community Survey, New Haven has the highest percentage of commuters who bicycle to work of any major metropolitan center on the East Coast.<ref>{{cite web |title=More Bicycling, Walking to Work; New Haven Leads the Way in Connecticut |url=http://ctbythenumbers.info/2014/05/22/more-bicycling-walking-to-work-new-haven-leads-the-way-in-connecticut/ |website=Connecticut by the Numbers |access-date=February 4, 2019 |date=May 22, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204122337/http://ctbythenumbers.info/2014/05/22/more-bicycling-walking-to-work-new-haven-leads-the-way-in-connecticut/ |archive-date=February 4, 2019 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===Rail===

[[File:Metro-North train 1567 enters Stamford.jpg|thumb|A Metro-North Railroad New Haven Line train leaving [[Stamford Transportation Center|Stamford Station]]]]

Rail is a popular travel mode between New Haven and New York City's [[Grand Central Terminal]]. Southwestern Connecticut is served by the [[Metro-North Railroad]]'s [[New Haven Line]], operated by the [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]. Metro-North provides commuter service between New York City and New Haven, with branches to [[New Canaan Branch|New Canaan]], [[Danbury Branch|Danbury]], and [[Waterbury Branch|Waterbury]]. Connecticut lies along [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]], which features frequent [[Northeast Regional]] and [[Acela Express]] service from New Haven south to New York City, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, DC, and Norfolk, VA, as well as north to [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] and Boston. Since 1990, coastal cities and towns between New Haven and New London are also served by the [[Shore Line East]] commuter line.<ref>{{Cite web|title=FAQs|url=https://shorelineeast.com/rider-resources/faqs|access-date=October 16, 2021|website=shorelineeast.com}}</ref>

In June 2018, a commuter rail service called the [[Hartford Line]] began operating between New Haven and Springfield on Amtrak's [[New Haven-Springfield Line]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.ctpost.com/business/article/Hartford-Line-debuts-with-10K-passengers-in-week-1-13027819.php|title=Hartford Line debuts with 10K passengers in first week|date=June 26, 2018|website=Connecticut Post|access-date=September 19, 2018|archive-date=July 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200728204857/https://www.ctpost.com/business/article/Hartford-Line-debuts-with-10K-passengers-in-week-1-13027819.php|url-status=live |last1=Soule |first1=By Alexander }}</ref> Hartford Line service is provided by both Amtrak and the Connecticut Department of Transportation's [[CT Rail]], and in addition to its termini serves [[New Haven State Street station|New Haven State Street]], Wallingford, Meriden, Berlin, [[Hartford Union Station|Hartford]], Windsor, and Windsor Locks. Several infill stations are planned to be added in the near future as of 2021. Amtrak's [[Vermonter (train)|Vermonter]] runs from Washington to St. Albans, Vermont via the same line. In July 2019, Amtrak launched the [[Valley Flyer (Amtrak train)|Valley Flyer]], which runs between New Haven and [[Greenfield, Massachusetts]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Corselli|first=Andrew|date=August 28, 2019|title=Amtrak, MassDOT To Launch Valley Flyer Service|url=https://www.railwayage.com/passenger/amtrak-massdot-to-launch-valley-flyer-service/|url-status=live|access-date=October 16, 2021|website=Railway Age|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828200508/https://www.railwayage.com/passenger/amtrak-massdot-to-launch-valley-flyer-service/ |archive-date=August 28, 2019 }}</ref>

A proposed commuter rail service, the [[Central Corridor Rail Line]], would connect New London with [[Norwich, CT|Norwich]], [[Willimantic, CT|Willimantic]], [[Storrs, CT|Storrs]] via the main campus of the [[University of Connecticut]], and [[Stafford Springs, CT|Stafford Springs]], with service continuing into [[Massachusetts]] and [[Brattleboro, Vermont]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Bessette|first=Claire|date=October 4, 2012|title=All aboard for the Central Corridor line|url=https://www.theday.com/article/20121004/NWS01/121009823|url-status=live|access-date=October 16, 2021|website=The Day|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727201742/http://www.theday.com/article/20121004/NWS01/121009823 |archive-date=July 27, 2014 }}</ref> The proposal also adds stops to service popular tourist destinations [[Foxwoods Resort Casino]] and [[Mohegan Sun]].

===Bus===

Statewide [[bus]] service is supplied by [[Connecticut Transit]], owned by the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]], with smaller municipal authorities providing local service. Bus networks are an important part of the transportation system in Connecticut, especially in urban areas like Hartford, Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport and New Haven. Connecticut Transit also operates [[CTfastrak]], a [[bus rapid transit]] service between [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] and [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], which opened to the public on March 28, 2015.<ref name=march28>{{cite press release |url=http://ctfastrak.com/about/news/news-releases/13-media-releases/279-03-28-15-despite-snow-thousands-of-riders-many-first-timers-experience-ctfastrak-on-first-day-of-service |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911222239/http://ctfastrak.com/about/news/news-releases/13-media-releases/279-03-28-15-despite-snow-thousands-of-riders-many-first-timers-experience-ctfastrak-on-first-day-of-service |archive-date=September 11, 2015 |title=Despite Snow, Thousands of Riders, Many First-Timers, Experience CTfastrak on First Day of Service |publisher=Connecticut Department of Transportation |date=March 28, 2015}}</ref><ref name=CTfastrak>{{cite web|title=What Is CTfastrak|url=http://www.ctfastrak.com/about/what-is-ctfastrak|publisher=State of Connecticut|access-date=October 18, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014173042/http://www.ctfastrak.com/about/what-is-ctfastrak|archive-date=October 14, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=LaPorte|first=Mike|title=The Busway to the Future: Insider to CTfastrak before Opening to Public|url=http://livewiremcc.org/2014/11/05/the-busway-to-the-future-insider-to-ctfastrak-before-opening-to-public/|access-date=December 11, 2014|work=The Live Wire|publisher=Manchester Community College|date=November 5, 2014|archive-date=December 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211050837/http://livewiremcc.org/2014/11/05/the-busway-to-the-future-insider-to-ctfastrak-before-opening-to-public/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Connecticut's largest airport is [[Bradley International Airport]] in [[Windsor Locks]], {{convert|15|mile|km}} north of [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]].{{citation needed|date=March 2024}} Many residents of central and southern Connecticut also make heavy use of [[JFK International Airport]] and [[Newark International Airport]]s, especially for international travel. Smaller regional air service is provided at [[Tweed New Haven Regional Airport]]. Larger civil airports include [[Danbury Municipal Airport]] and [[Waterbury-Oxford Airport]] in western Connecticut, [[Hartford–Brainard Airport]] in central Connecticut, and [[Groton-New London Airport]] in eastern Connecticut. [[Sikorsky Memorial Airport]] is located in Stratford and mostly services cargo, helicopter and private aviation.

===Constitutional history===

{{Main|History of the Connecticut Constitution}}

Connecticut is known as the "Constitution State". The origin of this nickname is uncertain, but it likely comes from Connecticut's pivotal role in the federal constitutional convention of 1787, during which [[Roger Sherman]] and [[Oliver Ellsworth]] helped to orchestrate what became known as the [[Connecticut Compromise]], or the Great Compromise. This plan combined the [[Virginia Plan]] and the [[New Jersey Plan]] to form a bicameral legislature, a form copied by almost every state constitution since the adoption of the federal constitution. Variations of the bicameral legislature had been proposed by Virginia and New Jersey, but Connecticut's plan was the one that was in effect until the early 20th century, when Senators ceased to be selected by their state legislatures and were instead directly elected. Otherwise, it is still the design of Congress.

The nickname also might refer to the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut|Fundamental Orders]] of 1638–39. These Fundamental Orders represent the framework for the first formal Connecticut state government written by a representative body in Connecticut. The State of Connecticut government has operated under the direction of four separate documents in the course of the state's [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|constitutional history]]. After the Fundamental Orders, Connecticut was granted governmental authority by King [[Charles II of England]] through the Connecticut Charter of 1662.

Separate branches of government did not exist during this period, and the General Assembly acted as the supreme authority. A constitution similar to the modern [[U.S. Constitution]] was not adopted in Connecticut until 1818. Finally, the current state constitution was implemented in 1965. The 1965 constitution absorbed a majority of its 1818 predecessor, but incorporated a handful of important modifications.

===Executive===

The governor heads the executive branch. {{As of|2020}}, [[Ned Lamont]] is the [[List of Governors of Connecticut|Governor]]<ref>{{cite web | url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | title=Governor Malloy's Biography | publisher=State of Connecticut | website=Portal.CT.gov | access-date=October 25, 2015 | archive-date=September 14, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150914080022/http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Governor/About/Governor_Malloy_s_Biography/ | url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Susan Bysiewicz]] is the [[List of Lieutenant Governors of Connecticut|Lieutenant Governor]];<ref>{{cite web | url=http://portal.ct.gov/Departments_and_Agencies/Office_of_the_Lieutenant_Governor/About/Lt__Governor_s_Biography/ | title=Lt.

From 1639 until the adoption of the 1818 constitution, the governor presided over the General Assembly. In 1974, [[Ella Grasso]] was elected as the governor of Connecticut. This was the first time in United States history when a woman was a governor without her husband being governor first.<ref name=Pumont/>

There are several executive departments: Administrative Services, Agriculture, Banking, Children and Families, Consumer Protection, Correction, Economic and Community Development, [[Connecticut Department of Developmental Services|Developmental Services]], Construction Services, Education, Emergency Management and Public Protection, Energy & Environmental Protection, Higher Education, Insurance, Labor, Mental Health and Addiction Services, Military, Motor Vehicles, Public Health, Public Utility Regulatory Authority, Public Works, Revenue Services, Social Services, [[Connecticut Department of Transportation|Transportation]], and Veterans Affairs. In addition to these departments, there are other independent bureaus, offices and commissions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://portal.ct.gov/Department-and-Agencies/ |title=Departments and Agencies |website=Portal.CT.gov |publisher=State of Connecticut |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-date=October 7, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007042027/http://portal.ct.gov/Department-and-Agencies/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In addition to the governor and lieutenant governor, there are four other executive officers named in the state constitution that are elected directly by voters: secretary of the state, treasurer, comptroller, and attorney general. All executive officers are elected to four-year terms.<ref name="AboutCT"/>

===Legislative===

Connecticut's legislative branch is known as the [[Connecticut General Assembly|General Assembly]]. It is a [[bicameral]] legislature consisting of an upper body, the [[Connecticut Senate|State Senate]] (36 senators); and a lower body, the [[Connecticut House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (151 representatives).<ref name="AboutCT"/> Bills must pass each house in order to become law. The governor can veto bills, but this veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority in both houses. Per Article XV of the state constitution, Senators and Representatives must be at least 18 years of age and are elected to two-year terms in November on even-numbered years. There also must always be between 30 and 50 senators and 125 to 225 representatives. The Lieutenant Governor presides over the Senate, except when absent from the chamber, when the [[Presidents pro tempore of the Connecticut Senate|President pro tempore]] presides. The [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] presides over the House.<ref name="CT_CONST">{{cite web |title=Constitution of the State of Connecticut |website=Secretary of the State |publisher=State of Connecticut |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?A=3188&Q=392288 |date=April 21, 2009 |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151109004649/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392288 |archive-date=November 9, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> {{As of|2021}}, [[Matthew Ritter]] is the Speaker of the House of Connecticut.

===Judicial===

The highest [[court]] of Connecticut's judicial branch is the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]], headed by the Chief Justice of Connecticut. The Supreme Court is responsible for deciding on the constitutionality of laws, or cases as they relate to the law. Its proceedings are similar to those of the United States Supreme Court: no testimony is given by witnesses, and the lawyers of the two sides each present oral arguments no longer than thirty minutes. Following a court proceeding, the court may take several months to arrive at a judgment. {{As of|2020}}, the [[Chief Justice]] is [[Richard A. Robinson]].

In 1818, the court became a separate entity, independent of the legislative and executive branches.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jud.state.ct.us/ystday/history.html |title=About Connecticut Courts: History of the Courts |website=Judicial Branch |publisher=State of Connecticut |access-date=February 20, 2007 |archive-date=January 17, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117052828/http://www.jud.state.ct.us/ystday/history.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Connecticut Appellate Court]] is a lesser statewide court, and the Superior Courts are lower courts that resemble county courts of other states.

Connecticut county governments were mostly eliminated in 1960, with the exception of [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs]] elected in each county.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392376 |website=State Register and Manual |publisher=State of Connecticut |title=Section VI: Counties |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906001437/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392376 |archive-date=September 6, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2000, the county sheriff was abolished and replaced with the [[Connecticut State Marshal|state marshal]] system, which has districts that follow the old county territories. The judicial system is divided into judicial districts at the trial-court level which largely follow the old county lines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jud.ct.gov/directory/directory/location/Default.htm |title=Judicial District Courts Staff Directory |website=State of Connecticut Judicial Branch |access-date=July 25, 2010 |archive-date=August 12, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100812060541/http://www.jud.ct.gov/directory/directory/location/Default.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[list of Connecticut counties|eight counties]] are still widely used for purely geographical and statistical purposes, such as [[Weather forecasting|weather reports]] and census reporting, although the latter of which will cease in 2024.

The state is divided into nine regional [[Councils of governments in Connecticut|councils of government]] defined by the state Office of Planning and Management, which facilitate regional planning and coordination of services between member towns.<ref name="OPM-2">{{Cite web|url = http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?q=383046|title = Regional Councils of Governments (RCOGs) in Connecticut|date = 2015|access-date = September 15, 2015|website = CT.gov|publisher = Office of Policy and Management|archive-date = September 17, 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150917200410/http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?q=383046|url-status = live}}</ref><!--, with the exception of the Town of Stafford in Tolland County.<ref name="OPM">{{cite web |url=http://www.ct.gov/opm/cwp/view.asp?a=2985&q=383124 |title=Regional Planning Coordination |website=Office of Policy and Management |publisher=State of Connecticut |access-date=July 25, 2010}}</ref>--> The Intragovernmental Policy Division of this Office coordinates regional planning with the administrative bodies of these regions.

In 2019 the state recommended to the [[United States Census Bureau]] that the nine Councils of Governments replace its counties for statistical purposes.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Proposed Change to County Equivalents in Connecticut|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/reference/ct_county_equiv_change.pdf|website=US Census Bureau}}</ref> This proposal was approved by the Census Bureau in 2022, and will be fully implemented by 2024.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://portal.ct.gov/Office-of-the-Governor/News/Press-Releases/2022/06-2022/Governor-Lamont-Announces-Census-Bureau-Approves-Proposal-for-Planning-Regions |title=Governor Lamont Announces U.S. Census Bureau Approves Proposal for Connecticut's Planning Regions To Become County Equivalents |publisher=The Office of Governor Ned Lamont |date=June 6, 2022 |access-date=March 24, 2023}}</ref>

Connecticut shares with the rest of [[New England]] a governmental institution called the [[New England town]]. The state is divided into 169 towns which serve as the fundamental political jurisdictions.<ref name="AboutCT"/> There are also 21 cities,<ref name="AboutCT"/> most of which simply follow the boundaries of their namesake towns and have a merged city-town government. There are two exceptions: the [[Groton (city), Connecticut|City of Groton]], which is a subsection of the [[Groton (town), Connecticut|Town of Groton]], and the City of [[Winsted, Connecticut|Winsted]] in the Town of [[Winchester, Connecticut|Winchester]]. There are also nine incorporated [[Borough (Connecticut)|boroughs]] which may provide additional services to a section of town.<ref name="AboutCT"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Town Elections, Boroughs in Connecticut with Date of Incorporation |website=Secretary of the State |publisher=State of Connecticut |date=June 19, 2013 |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392430#CITIES_IN_CONNECTICUT_WITH_DATE_OF_INCORPORATION |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908155417/http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&q=392430#CITIES_IN_CONNECTICUT_WITH_DATE_OF_INCORPORATION |archive-date=September 8, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[Naugatuck]] is a consolidated town and borough.
