'''Drammen''' ({{IPA-no|ˈdrɑ̀mːən}}) is a city and municipality in [[Buskerud]] county, [[Norway]]. The port and river city of Drammen is centrally located in the south-eastern and most populated part of Norway. Drammen municipality also includes smaller towns and villages such as [[Konnerud]], [[Svelvik]], [[Mjøndalen]] and [[Skoger]].

==Location==
Drammen is located west of the [[Oslofjord]] inlet, situated approximately 44&nbsp;km (27 mi) southwest of the capital city of Oslo. There are more than 100,000 inhabitants in the municipality, though the city is the regional capital of an area with around 82,000 residents. Drammen, and its adjacent communities, are experiencing more socioeconomic and population growth than ever before. The city makes good use of the  [[Drammensfjord]], a waterway utilised for recreation, fishing and other activities, as well as waterfront housing.

==Name and coat of arms==
The [[Old Norse]] form of the city's name was ''Drafn'', and this was originally the name of the inner part of [[Drammensfjord]]. The [[fjord]] is, however, probably named after the river [[Drammenselva]] (Norse ''Drǫfn''), and this again is derived from ''drǫfn'' f '[[wave]]'.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sproglig-historiske studier|first=Carl Rikard|last=Unger|publisher=H. Aschehoug & Co.|location=Kristiania, Norge|year=1896|access-date=6 January 2009|page=37|url=https://archive.org/details/sproglighistori00ungegoog|language=no}}</ref>
The [[Coat of arms|coat-of-arms]] is from modern times.  They were granted on 17 November 1960.  The arms has a silver-colored column on top a silver-colored bedrock crossed with a silver-colored key and sword against a blue background.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Thorsnæs |first1=Geir |title=Drammen |date=2022-03-18 |url=http://snl.no/Drammen |work=Store norske leksikon |language=nb |access-date=2022-06-30 |last2=Askheim |first2=Svein}}</ref>  It is based upon the old seal dating from 1723 for [[Bragernes]], one of the central parts of Drammen. The [[motto]] for Bragernes (in [[Latin]]) was ''In Fide Et Justitia Fortitudo'' ({{langx|en|in faith and justice is strength}}), and the items in the seal are referring to this: key = faith, sword = justice, column on rocks = strength.<ref>{{cite web|date=5 July 2006 |title=Kommunevåpen |publisher=Fotw.us |access-date=6 January 2009 |url=http://fotw.us/flags/no-06-02.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503004129/http://fotw.us/flags/no-06-02.html |archive-date=3 May 2009}}</ref>

== Governance ==
On January 1, 2020, the municipalities of Svelvik, Nedre Eiker and Drammen merged to form «The New Drammen Municipality». The new municipality, which is now called Drammen, is Norway's seventh largest with over 100,000 residents. The main seat of the Greater Municipality is located in the city of Drammen.
Drammen city had a population of 82.875 inhabitants in 2021, but serves as a regional centre for an area that had a population of 110.236 inhabitants in 2021.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tettsteders befolkning og areal |url=https://www.ssb.no/befolkning/folketall/statistikk/tettsteders-befolkning-og-areal |access-date=2022-06-30 |website=SSB |language=nb}}</ref> The city is the country's record champion in environment and urban development, 21 prices since 2003 with 16 national and 5 international.

===Districts===
After the merger of the municipalities Drammen, Nedre Eiker and Svelvik in 2020, the municipality was then divided into ten municipal regions:

==History==
[[Petroglyph|Rock carving]]s at Åskollen and Austad are 6000 to 7000 years old, and are the first signs of human activity in the area. The largest rock carving at Åskollen depicts a [[moose]].

Drammen originally consisted of three [[market town#Norway|small seaports]]: [[Bragernes]] (on the northern side of the [[Drammenselva]] river) and [[Strømsø]] and [[Tangen, Drammen|Tangen]] (both on the southern side of the river). For trade purposes, small seaports were placed under market towns. Despite their geographical proximity, Bragernes was placed under [[Oslo|Christiania]] and Strømsø under [[Tønsberg]]. For this reason, cooperation between the adjacent seaport towns was almost impossible.

In 1662, a merger was proposed to unite Strømsø and Bragernes to form a market town with the name Frederiksstrøm. The proposal was rejected by King [[Frederick III of Denmark|Frederick III]]. Bragernes received limited market town rights in 1715, and merged with Strømsø to gain status as a single [[cities of Norway|city]] on 19 June 1811.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://drammenshistorie.com/kort.shtml|title=Kort oversikt over Drammens historie |access-date=7 December 2006|last=Søbstad|first=Per Ivar|work=History of Drammen |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060822101932/http://drammenshistorie.com/kort.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 22 August 2006|language=no}}</ref>

Its geographical location made the city favorable for seafaring, [[shipbuilding]], [[log driving]], timber trade. During the 19th century, paper and pulp industries were developed.  Large parts of the city were ruined in the great fire of 12–13 July 1866,{{sfn|Tingle|1866}} which led to the reconstruction of the city centre, including the characteristic town square and Bragernes church. The [[Drammen Line]] (''Drammenbanen'' ) opened in 1872 providing rail service between Drammen and Oslo.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=    https://snl.no/Drammenbanen|title= Drammenbanen|encyclopedia =  Store norske leksikon|author=  Tor Wisting|access-date= 1 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://drammenshistorie.com/bybranner.shtml|title=Bybranner |access-date=7 December 2006|last=Søbstad|first=Per Ivar|work=History of Drammen |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20061110005457/http://drammenshistorie.com/bybranner.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archive-date = 10 November 2006|language=no}}</ref>

In 1909, Drammen got the first [[trolleybus]] system in [[Scandinavia]], the [[Trolleybuses in Drammen|Drammen trolleybus]]. The lines ran until 1967. For many years the centre of Drammen suffered from heavy traffic. In 1970, [[Drammen Bridge]] with two lanes on European route E18 was built (expanded to four lanes in 2006) and in 1999 the opening of the Bragernes tunnel (''Bragernestunnelen'') diverted additional traffic away from the centre of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=    https://structurae.net/structures/drammen-bridge|title= Drammen Bridge|publisher =    structurae.net |access-date= 1 October 2016}}</ref>

In recent years, the city centre has seen the introduction of new housing, shopping facilities, restaurants, cafes and bars, as well as a public pathway along the [[Drammenselva]] river.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historier.no/index.php?option=com_sobi2&catid=72&Itemid=305 |title=Steder – Buskerud – Drammen |publisher=Historier.no |access-date=5 September 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120804055602/http://www.historier.no/index.php?option=com_sobi2&catid=72&Itemid=305 |archive-date=4 August 2012  }}</ref>

==Geography==
Drammen is one of the larger cities in Norway, and lies about {{convert|40|km|mi}} from the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of Norway, [[Oslo]]. The city centre lies at the end of a [[valley]], on both sides of the Drammenselva river, and where the river meets the [[Drammensfjord]]. The [[Holmen (Drammen)|Holmen]] island in Drammen is also the main [[harbor]] for car and fruit import in Norway.

The Drammen region is part of the metropolitan region around [[Oslo]] and the country's fifth largest urban area, it extends far beyond the municipal boundaries; into the municipalities of [[Lier, Norway|Lier]], [[Asker]], [[Øvre Eiker]] and [[Holmestrand]]. The total population of the settlement is 110,236 inhabitants as of 1 January 2021.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.ssb.no/en/statbank/table/04859/tableViewLayout1/ | title=04859: Area and population of urban settlements (US) 2000 – 2021-PX-Web SSB }}</ref>

In 2008 Drammen won the prestigious prize for the best city development in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ceu-ectp.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=107&Itemid=29 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130213060150/http://www.ceu-ectp.eu/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=107&Itemid=29 |url-status=dead |archive-date=13 February 2013 |title=CEU ECTP – The 7th European Urban and Regional Planning Awards 2008 |publisher=Ceu-ectp.eu |access-date=5 September 2015 }}</ref>
