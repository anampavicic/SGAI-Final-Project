==Etymology==
{{Main|Name of Pittsburgh}}
Pittsburgh was named in 1758, by General [[John Forbes (British Army officer)|John Forbes]], in honor of British statesman [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham]]. As Forbes was a [[Scottish people|Scotsman]], he probably pronounced the name {{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|ɪ|t|s|b|ər|ə}} {{respell|PITS|bər|ə}} (similar to [[Edinburgh]]).<ref name="spell">{{cite web |url=http://www.carnegielibrary.org/exhibit/hname.html |title=How to Spell Pittsburgh |work=[[Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh]] |access-date=September 22, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001234852/http://www.carnegielibrary.org/exhibit/hname.html |archive-date=October 1, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/52943/how-pittsburgh-got-its-h-back-and-7-other-geographic-naming-oddities |title=How Pittsburgh Got Its "H" Back |last=Conradt |first=Stacy |date=October 1, 2013 |website=[[Mental Floss]] |access-date=May 18, 2019}}</ref>

Pittsburgh was incorporated as a [[Borough (Pennsylvania)|borough]] on April 22, 1794, with the following Act:<ref>{{cite news |url=http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/03001/700027-209.stm |title=Pittsburgh Facts |work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |access-date=October 21, 2007 |date=January 1, 2003 |archive-date=May 31, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120531055755/http://old.post-gazette.com/pg/03001/700027-209.stm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

From 1891 to 1911, the city's name was federally recognized as "Pittsburg", though use of the final ''h'' was retained during this period by the city government and other local organizations.<ref>{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=George R. |author-link=George R.

In 1749, French soldiers from Quebec launched an expedition to the forks to unite [[Canada (New France)|Canada]] with [[Louisiana (New France)|French Louisiana]] via the rivers.<ref name="chronology" /> During 1753–1754, the British hastily built [[Fort Prince George]] before a larger French force drove them off. The French built [[Fort Duquesne]] based on LaSalle's 1669 claims. The [[French and Indian War]], the North American front of the [[Seven Years' War]], began with the future Pittsburgh as its center.

During this period, the powerful nations of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]], based in New York, had maintained control of much of the Ohio Valley as hunting grounds by right of conquest after defeating other tribes. By the terms of the 1768 [[Treaty of Fort Stanwix]], the [[William Penn|Penns]] were allowed to purchase the modern region from the [[Iroquois]].

Following the [[American Revolution]], the village of Pittsburgh continued to grow. One of its earliest industries was boat building for settlers of the [[Ohio Country]]. In 1784, Thomas Vickroy completed a town plan which was approved by the Penn family attorney. Pittsburgh became a possession of Pennsylvania in 1785. The following year, the [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] was started, and in 1787, the [[University of Pittsburgh|Pittsburgh Academy]] was chartered. Unrest during the [[Whiskey Rebellion]] of 1794 resulted in federal troops being sent to the area. By 1797, glass manufacture began, while the population grew to around 1,400. Settlers arrived after crossing the [[Appalachian Mountains]] or through the [[Great Lakes]].<!-- and then what? up the Ohio River? --> [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]] (now Pittsburgh) at the source of the Ohio River became the main base for settlers moving into the [[Northwest Territory]].

The [[War of 1812]] cut off the supply of British goods, stimulating American industry. By 1815, Pittsburgh was producing significant quantities of iron, brass, tin, and glass. On March 18, 1816, the 46-year-old local government became a city. It was served by numerous river steamboats that increased trading traffic on the rivers.

In the 1830s, many [[Welsh people]] from the [[Merthyr]] steelworks immigrated to the city following the aftermath of the [[Merthyr Rising]]. By the 1840s, Pittsburgh was one of the largest cities west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. The [[Great Fire of Pittsburgh]] destroyed over a thousand buildings in 1845. The city rebuilt with the aid of Irish immigrants who came to escape the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]]. By 1857, Pittsburgh's 1,000 factories were consuming 22&nbsp;million coal bushels yearly. Coal mining and iron manufacturing attracted waves of European immigrants to the area, with the most coming from [[Germany]].

Because Pennsylvania had been established as a free state after the Revolution, enslaved African Americans sought freedom here through escape as refugees from the South, or occasionally fleeing from travelers they were serving who stayed in the city. There were active stations of the [[Underground Railroad]] in the city, and numerous refugees were documented as getting help from station agents and African-American workers in city hotels. The Drennen Slave Girl walked out of the Monongahela House in 1850, apparently to freedom.<ref name="freedom">William J. Switala, ''Underground Railroad in Pennsylvania'', Stackpole Books, 2001, pp. 88-89</ref> The Merchant's Hotel was also a place where African-American workers would advise slaves the state was free and aid them in getting to nearby stations of the Underground Railroad.<ref name="exhibit">[http://exhibit.library.pitt.edu/freeatlast/fugitive_laws.html Exhibit: ''Free at Last? Slavery in Pittsburgh in the 18th and 19th Centuries''], 2009, University of Pittsburgh Library</ref> Sometimes refugee slaves from the South stayed in Pittsburgh, but other times they continued North, including into Canada. Many slaves left the city and county for Canada after Congress passed the 1850 [[Fugitive Slave Act]], as it required cooperation from law enforcement even in free states and increased penalties. From 1850 to 1860, the black population in Allegheny County dropped from 3,431 to 2,725 as people headed to more safety in Canada.<ref name="freedom"/>

The [[American Civil War]] boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand by the Union. [[Andrew Carnegie]] began steel production in 1875 at the [[Edgar Thomson Steel Works]] in [[North Braddock, Pennsylvania]], which evolved into the [[Carnegie Steel Company]]. He adopted the [[Bessemer process]] to increase production. Manufacturing was key to growth of Pittsburgh and the surrounding region. Railroad lines were built into the city along both rivers, increasing transportation access to important markets.

In 1901, [[J. P. Morgan]] and attorney [[Elbert Henry Gary|Elbert H. Gary]] merged [[Carnegie Steel Company]] and several other companies into [[U.S. Steel]]. By 1910, Pittsburgh was the [[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade|nation's eighth-largest city]], accounting for between one-third and one-half of national steel output.

The [[Pittsburgh Agreement]] was subscribed in May 1918 between the Czech and Slovak nationalities, as envisioned by [[T. G. Masaryk]], concerning the future foundation of [[Czechoslovakia]].<ref>PRECLÍK, Vratislav.

The city suffered [[Pittsburgh flood of 1936|severe flooding]] in March 1936.

The city's population swelled to more than a half million, attracting numerous European immigrants to its industrial jobs. By 1940, non-Hispanic whites were 90.6% of the city's population.<ref>{{cite web |title=Race and Hispanic Origin for Selected Cities and Other Places: Earliest Census to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |access-date=January 3, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012}}</ref> Pittsburgh also became a main destination of the African-American [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] from the rural South during the first half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.post-gazette.com/lifestyle/20030218kids0218p9.asp |title=Kids' Corner: 1910-30 saw huge black migration |last=Boucher |first=Amber |date=February 18, 2003 |website=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |access-date=May 18, 2019 |archive-date=December 9, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181209121819/http://old.post-gazette.com/lifestyle/20030218kids0218p9.asp |url-status=dead }}</ref> Limited initially by discrimination, some 95% percent of the men became unskilled steel workers.<ref>Lubove, Roy, ed.

Following World War II, the city launched a clean air and civic revitalization project known as the "Renaissance," cleaning up the air and the rivers. The "Renaissance II" project followed in 1977, focused on cultural and neighborhood development. The industrial base continued to expand through the 1970s, but beginning in the early 1980s both the area's steel and electronics industries imploded during national industrial restructuring. There were massive layoffs from mill and plant closures.<ref name="diaspora"/>

In the later 20th century, the area shifted its economic base to education, tourism, and services, largely based on healthcare/medicine, finance, and high technology such as robotics. Although Pittsburgh successfully shifted its economy and remained viable, the city's population has never rebounded to its industrial-era highs. While 680,000 people lived in the city proper in 1950, a combination of suburbanization and economic turbulence resulted in a decrease in city population, even as the metropolitan area population increased again.

===21st century===
During the [[late 2000s recession]], Pittsburgh was economically strong, adding jobs when most cities were losing them. It was one of the few cities in the United States to see housing property values rise. Between 2006 and 2011, the [[Pittsburgh metropolitan area|Pittsburgh]] [[metropolitan statistical area]] (MSA) experienced over 10% appreciation in housing prices, the highest appreciation of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas in the United States, with 22 of the largest 25 metropolitan statistical areas experiencing depreciations in housing values.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nullspace2.blogspot.com/2011/12/more-pittsburgh-real-estate-trends.html |title=More Pittsburgh real estate trends |last=Briem |first=Christopher |date=December 30, 2011 |work=Nullspace|access-date=January 1, 2012}}</ref>

====Air quality====
The [[American Lung Association|American Lung Association's]] (ALA) 2023 "State of the Air" report (which included data from 2019 to 2021) showed air quality in Pittsburgh improving. The city received a passing grade for ozone pollution, going from an F to a C grade, and improving from the 46th to 54th most polluted by ozone smog.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Guay |first=Jessica |date=April 19, 2023 |title=American Lung Association report puts Pittsburgh area among worst for air quality - CBS Pittsburgh |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/dangerous-for-peoples-health-american-lung-association-report-puts-pittsburgh-among-worst-places-for-air-quality/ |access-date=February 7, 2024 |website=www.cbsnews.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

According to daily ozone air quality data provided by the EPA, from 2021 to 2024, Pittsburgh had good or moderate air quality most of the time.<ref>{{Cite web |last=US EPA |first=OAR |date=September 23, 2016 |title=Air Data - Multiyear Tile Plot |url=https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/air-data-multiyear-tile-plot |access-date=February 7, 2024 |website=www.epa.gov |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=EPA: Air Quality Trends By City 2000-2022 |url=https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-05/airqualitytrendsbycity2000-2022.xlsx |website=EPA}}</ref> Then-Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald said in December 2023 that they’d seen an "80 % drop in hazardous air pollutants" and that they made EPA attainment at all eight county air monitors for the first time in 2020, and then also achieved that goal in 2021, 2022, and were on track for better results in 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fitzgerald |first=Rich |date=December 27, 2023 |title=Rich Fitzgerald: Reflecting on 12 years of service |url=https://triblive.com/opinion/rich-fitzgerald-reflecting-on-12-years-of-service/ |access-date=February 7, 2024 |website=TribLIVE.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

A past 2019 "State of the Air" report from the [[American Lung Association]] (ALA) found that air quality in the Pittsburgh-New Castle-Weirton, PA-OH-WV metro area worsened compared to previous reports, not only for ozone (smog), but also for the second year in a row for both the daily and long-term measures of fine particle pollution. In 2019, outside of California, Allegheny County was the only county in the United States that recorded failing grades for all three.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.lung.org/local-content/_content-items/about-us/media/press-releases/air-quality-in-pittsburgh.html |title=Air Quality in Pittsburgh Metro Area Worsened for both Ozone and Particle Pollution, Finds 2019 'State of the Air' Report |date=April 24, 2019 |work=American Lung Association}}</ref>

In a 2013 ranking of 277 metropolitan areas in the United States, the [[American Lung Association]] ranked only six U.S. metro areas as having higher amounts of short-term particle pollution, and only seven U.S. metro areas having higher amounts of year-round particle pollution than Pittsburgh. For ozone (smog) pollution, Pittsburgh was ranked 24th among U.S. metro areas.<ref>[http://www.stateoftheair.org/2013/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities.html American Lung Association State of the Air 2013 – Most Polluted Cities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107185644/http://www.stateoftheair.org/2013/city-rankings/most-polluted-cities.html |date=January 7, 2015 }}.

Although the county was still below the "pass" threshold, the report showed substantial improvement over previous decades on every air quality measure. Fewer than 15 high ozone days were reported between 2007 and 2009, and just 10 between 2008 and 2010, compared to more than 40 between 1997 and 1999.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stateoftheair.org/2012/msas/Pittsburgh-New-Castle-PA.html |title=Allegheny County and Pittsburgh-New Castle, PA |year=2012 |work=State of the Air 2011 |publisher=American Lung Association|access-date=May 28, 2012|archive-date=August 25, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825005342/http://www.stateoftheair.org/2012/msas/Pittsburgh-New-Castle-PA.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> ACHD spokesman Guillermo Cole stated "It's the best it's been in the lifetime for virtually every resident in this county ...

As of 2005, the city includes 31,000 trees on 900 miles of streets. A 2011 analysis of Pittsburgh's tree cover, which involved sampling more than 200 small plots throughout the city, showed a value of between $10 and $13 million in annual benefits based on the [[urban forest]] contributions to aesthetics, energy use and air quality. Energy savings from shade, impact on city air and water quality, and the boost in property values were taken into account in the analysis. The city spends $850,000 annually on street tree planting and maintenance.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/that-tree-on-the-corner-may-be-worth-more-than-your-house |title=Tree on the Corner May Be Worth More Than Your House |last=Seltenrich |first=Nate |date=February 18, 2013 |website=[[Next City]] |access-date=May 18, 2019}}</ref>

Despite improvements, some studies still suggest that poor air quality in Pittsburgh is causing negative health effects.

=== Demographic changes ===
Since the 1940s, some demographic changes have sometimes been caused by city initiatives for redevelopment.

Throughout the 1950s Pittsburgh's Lower Hill District faced massive demographic changes when 1,551, majority black, residents and 413 businesses were forced to relocate when the city of Pittsburgh used eminent domain to make space for the construction of the Civic Arena.<ref name="Lubove-1995" /> This Civic Arena ultimately opened in 1961.<ref name="Lubove-1995" /> The Civic Arena was built as part of one of Pittsburgh's revitalization campaigns. An auditorium in this space was initially proposed in 1947 by the Regional Planning Association and Urban Redevelopment Authority. The idea of an auditorium with a retractable roof that would house the Pittsburgh Civic Light Opera was more specifically proposed in 1953 by the Allegheny Conference on Community Redevelopment. The following year the Public Auditorium Authority of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County was formed. The Lower Hill District had been approved by the City Planning Commission in 1950.<ref name="Lubove-1995" /> Partially as a result of the Civic arena, the whole Hill District is estimated to only have 12,000 residents now.<ref name="Klein-2017">{{Cite web |last=Klein |first=Emily |date=December 27, 2017 |title=The Hill District, a community holding on through displacement and development |url=http://www.publicsource.org/hill-district-displacement-development/ |access-date=December 16, 2023 |website=PublicSource |language=en-US}}</ref> These governmental organizations caused demographic changes through creating a mass exodus from the lower hill district for the construction of the Civic Arena.<ref name="Lubove-1995" />

In the 1960s the Urban Redevelopment Authority attempted to redevelop East Liberty with the goal of preserving its status as a market center. Penn Center Mall was the result of this effort. In the process of constructing this mall, approximately 3,800 people were forced to relocate. This proved to be another case of government intervention resulting in demographic changes.<ref name="Gillette-2022">{{Cite book |last=Gillette |first=Howard |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctv1rdtwq2 |title=The Paradox of Urban Revitalization: Progress and Poverty in America's Postindustrial Era |date=2022 |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |isbn=978-0-8122-5371-9 |pages=191–214|jstor=j.ctv1rdtwq2 }}</ref>

Later on, in the early 2000s, movement of businesses into East Liberty, such as Home Depot, Whole Foods, and Google, created another demographic shift. This era of redevelopment was led by private developers who catered to what one scholar described as "Florida’s creative class." This change continued to be supported by the Urban Redevelopment Authority; particularly by the executive director Rob Stepney, who said of the redevelopment "We had an inspired and shared vision." When describing the result of redevelopment he said "East Liberty went from blighted and ‘keep off the grass’ to the definition of what millennials are looking for."<ref name="Gillette-2022" />

The Pittsburgh government’s choices during redevelopment and the resulting demographic changes have resulted in criticism and led some residents to believe that displacement was purposeful. In one article published in Public Source, a resident explains their belief that redevelopment plans are part of "deconcentration," an effort to spread out black and low-income residents in order to prevent them from being concentrated in one place.<ref name="Klein-2017" /> Others worry that these demographic changes are part of government complicity in gentrification.<ref>{{Cite web |date=April 5, 2022 |title=East Liberty will lose more affordable housing, but seller aims to fight long-term displacement |url=https://www.wesa.fm/development-transportation/2022-04-05/east-liberty-will-lose-more-affordable-housing-but-seller-aims-to-fight-long-term-displacement |access-date=December 16, 2023 |website=90.5 WESA |language=en}}</ref> Gentrification is a process where wealthier residents move into an area, altering it by increasing housing / renting costs and changing the market for businesses in the area. This displaces current residents who are unable to afford living in the changed neighborhood. In East Liberty, for example, people frequently cite housing units being demolished and replaced by businesses as evidence of gentrification. For example, when the East Mall public housing unit was demolished in 2009, and a Target built in its place.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Davis |first=Jeremiah |date=January 8, 2018 |title=What's left when the gentrifiers come marching in |url=http://www.publicsource.org/whats-left-when-the-gentrifiers-come-marching-in/ |access-date=December 16, 2023 |website=PublicSource |language=en-US}}</ref>

===Local dialect===
{{Main|Western Pennsylvania English}}
The Pittsburgh English dialect, commonly called ''[[Pittsburgh English|Pittsburghese]]'', was influenced by [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]], German, and [[Eastern European]] immigrants and African Americans.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pittsburghspeech.pitt.edu/PittsburghSpeech_History.html |title=History |website=pittsburghspeech.pitt.edu|access-date=October 19, 2018}}</ref> Locals who speak the dialect are sometimes referred to as "[[Yinzer]]s" (from the local word "yinz" [var. ''yunz''], a blended form of "you ones", similar to "y'all" and "you all" in the South). Common Pittsburghese terms are: "slippy" (slippery), "redd up" (clean up), "jagger bush" (thorn bush), and "gum bands" (rubber bands). The dialect is also notable for dropping the verb "to be". In Pittsburghese one would say "the car needs washed" instead of "needs to be washed", "needs washing", or "needs a wash." The dialect has some tonal similarities to other nearby regional dialects of Erie and Baltimore but is noted for its somewhat [[staccato]] rhythms. The staccato qualities of the dialect are thought to originate either from Welsh or other European languages. The many local peculiarities have prompted ''[[The New York Times]]'' to describe Pittsburgh as "the [[Galapagos Islands]] of American dialect".<ref>{{cite news |last=Sultan |first=Tim |date=March 17, 2006 |title=It's Not the Sights, It's the Sounds |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/travel/escapes/its-not-the-sights-its-the-sounds.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109203001/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/03/17/travel/escapes/17accent.html?pagewanted=2 |archive-date=January 9, 2007 |work=The New York Times |access-date=August 14, 2007}}</ref> The lexicon itself contains notable loans from [[Polish language|Polish]] and other European languages; examples include ''[[headscarf|babushka]]'', ''[[pierogi]]'', and ''[[halušky]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pittsburghspeech.pitt.edu/PittsburghSpeech_SpeechOverview.html |title=Overview |work=Pittsburgh Speech and Society | access-date = August 14, 2007}}</ref>

The [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] baseball team, often referred to as the Bucs or the Buccos (derived from [[buccaneer]]), is the city's oldest professional sports franchise, having been founded in 1881, and plays in the [[National League Central|Central Division]] of the [[National League (baseball)|National League]]. The Pirates are nine-time Pennant winners and five-time [[World Series]] Champions, were in the first [[1903 World Series|World Series (1903)]] and claim two pre-World Series titles in 1901 and 1902. The Pirates play in [[PNC Park]].

Pittsburgh also has a rich [[Negro league]] history, with the former [[Pittsburgh Crawfords]] and the [[Homestead Grays]] credited with as many as 14 league titles and 11 Hall of Famers between them in the 1930s and 1940s, while the [[Pittsburgh Keystones (baseball)|Keystones]] fielded teams in the 1920s. In addition, in 1971 the Pirates were the first Major League team to field an all-minority lineup. One sportswriter claimed, "No city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh."<ref>{{cite news |work=[[Beaver County Times]] |title=Baseball Plog |url=http://www.timesonline.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17047895&BRD=2305&PAG=461&dept_id=478568&rfi=6 |date=August 14, 2006 |first=John |last=Perrotto|author-link=John Perrotto|access-date=August 14, 2006|archive-date=November 12, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071112120043/http://www.timesonline.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=17047895&BRD=2305&PAG=461&dept_id=478568&rfi=6|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Since the late 20th century, the Pirates had three consecutive [[National League Championship Series]] appearances (1990–92) (going 6, 7 and 7 games each), followed by setting the MLB record for most consecutive losing seasons, with 20 from 1993 until 2012. This era was followed by three consecutive postseason appearances: the 2013 [[National League Division Series]] and the 2014–2015 Wild Card games. Their [[1997 Pittsburgh Pirates season|September pennant race]] in 1997 featured the franchises' last no-hitter and last award for [[The Sporting News Executive of the Year Award|Sporting News' Executive of the Year]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.alexreisner.com/baseball/history/race?y=1997|title=1997 Pennant Races|access-date=June 11, 2015|archive-date=February 11, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150211020347/http://archive.alexreisner.com/baseball/history/race?y=1997|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 2006, Council President [[Luke Ravenstahl]] was sworn in as mayor at age 26, becoming the youngest mayor in the history of any major American city. His successor, [[Bill Peduto]], was sworn in on January 6, 2014. In November 2021, Pittsburgh elected its first African-American mayor, [[Ed Gainey]].

Prior to the [[American Civil War]], Pittsburgh was strongly abolitionist. It is considered the [[History of the United States Republican Party|birthplace of the national Republican Party]],<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.pagop.org/about/history/ |access-date=April 19, 2022 |website=Republican Party of Pennsylvania |language=en-US}}</ref> as the party held its first convention here in February 1856. From the Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] stronghold. The effects of the [[Great Depression]], combined with entrenched local GOP scandals, resulted in a shift among voters to the Democratic Party. With the exceptions of the [[Pittsburgh mayoral election, 1973|1973]] and [[Pittsburgh mayoral election, 1977|1977]] elections (where lifelong Democrats ran off the party ticket), Democrats have been elected consecutively to the mayor's office since the [[Pittsburgh mayoral election, 1933|1933 election]]. The city's ratio of party registration is 5 to 1 Democrat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gmfus.org/template/page.cfm?page_id=481 |title=Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania – Transatlantic Cities Network |publisher=The German Marshall Fund of the United States|access-date=May 6, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619184138/http://gmfus.org/template/page.cfm?page_id=481|archive-date=June 19, 2010}}</ref>

[[File:Pittsburgh (view from the North Hills).JPG|thumb|[[Interstate 279|I-279]]]]
Locals refer to the interstates fanning out from [[downtown Pittsburgh]] as the "parkways." [[Interstate 376]] is both the "parkway east" connecting to [[Interstate 76 (Ohio–New Jersey)|Interstate 76]] ([[Pennsylvania Turnpike]]) and the "parkway west" connecting to [[Interstate 79]], the [[Pittsburgh International Airport]], the Ohio end of the Turnpike and [[Interstate 80]]. The "parkway north" is [[Interstate 279]] connecting to I-79. The "crosstown" is [[Interstate 579]] allowing access to the heart of downtown, the [[Liberty Tunnels]] and the [[PPG Paints Arena]]. The 45-mile-long and 70-mile-long expressway sections of [[Pennsylvania Route 28]] and [[U.S. Route 22]] also carry traffic from downtown to the northeast and western suburbs, respectively. [[Interstate 70]], 79 and 76 (the Turnpike) roughly form a triangular-shaped "beltway" with [[Interstate 68]] and 80 within the media market's northern and southern limits. Turnpike spurs such as the [[Mon–Fayette Expressway]], [[Pennsylvania Route 576]] and [[Pennsylvania Route 66#Amos K. Hutchinson Bypass|Route 66]] also help traffic flow. The non-expressway [[Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Belt System]] serves navigation in the region.

Pittsburgh's rail industry dates to 1851 when the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] first opened service between the Pittsburgh and [[Philadelphia]]. The [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]] entered the city in 1871. In 1865, [[Andrew Carnegie]] opened the [[Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works]], which manufactured for the industry until 1919. Carnegie also founded the [[Union Railroad (Pittsburgh)|Union Railroad]] in 1894 for heavy freight services and it still serves the area's steel industry, while [[George Westinghouse]]'s [[Wabtec]] has been a leader in rail engines and switching since 1869.

Pittsburgh is home to one of [[Norfolk Southern Railway]]'s busiest freight corridors, the [[Pittsburgh Line]], and operates up to 70 trains per day through the city. The suburban [[Conway Yard|Conway Rail Yard]], built in 1889, was the largest freight rail center in the world from 1956 until 1980 and is today the nation's second-largest. [[CSX]], the other major freight railroad in the eastern U.S., also has [[Pittsburgh Subdivision|major operations]] around Pittsburgh.
