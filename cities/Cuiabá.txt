'''Cuiabá''' ({{IPA|pt|kujaˈba}}) is the [[capital city]] and the largest city of the [[Brazil]]ian state of [[Mato Grosso]]. It is located near the geographical centre of South America and also  forms the metropolitan area of Mato Grosso, along with the neighbouring town of [[Várzea Grande, Mato Grosso|Várzea Grande]].<ref>[http://www.v-brazil.com/tourism/mato-grosso/cuiaba.html Mato Grosso - information] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130924043003/http://www.v-brazil.com/tourism/mato-grosso/cuiaba.html |date=2013-09-24 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref> The city's name is an indigenous [[Bororo language|Bororo]] word meaning 'arrow-fishing', The city was founded in 1719, during the [[gold rush]],<ref>[https://archive.today/20140128023237/http://exoduscry.com/prayer/city-in-focus/cuiaba/ City in Focus: Cuiabá, Brazil] {{in lang|en}}</ref> and it has been the state capital since 1818. The city is a trading centre for an extensive cattle-raising and agricultural area. The capital is among the fastest-growing cities in Brazil, followed by the growth of [[agribusiness]] in Mato Grosso, despite the recession that is affecting Brazilian industries.<ref>[http://www.visitbrasil.com/visitbrasil/opencms/portalembratur/mobile/en/reasons-to-visit.html?destino=agronegocios-em-cuiaba-.html] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812194416/http://www.visitbrasil.com/visitbrasil/opencms/portalembratur/mobile/en/reasons-to-visit.html?destino=agronegocios-em-cuiaba-.html|date=2014-08-12}} {{in lang|en}}</ref> Cuiabá was one of the host cities for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]].

Cuiabá is the heart of an [[urban area]] that also includes the state's second largest city, [[Várzea Grande, Mato Grosso|Várzea Grande]]. The city is the seat of the [[Federal University of Mato Grosso]] and the largest football stadium of the state, [[Arena Pantanal]].<ref>[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/145973/Cuiaba Cuiaba - Britannica] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202095236/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/145973/Cuiaba |date=2014-02-02 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>

The city is a rich mix of European, African and Native American influences and numerous [[museum]]s reflect this. Cuiabá is also notable for its [[cuisine]], [[dance]], [[music]] and [[Handicraft|craftwork]]. Known as the ''"Southern gate to the Amazon"'', Cuiabá experiences a hot humid tropical climate.

{{For timeline|Timeline of Cuiabá history}}

=== Colonial period ===

The first Portuguese explorers to Cuiabá were [[bandeirantes]], explorers, slavers, and fortune hunters based in the São Paulo region. The ''bandeirantes'' aided Brazil's great expansion westward, including to the Mato Grosso region. Manoel de Campos Bicudo, a ''bandeirante'' from São Paulo, visited the Cuiabá region in 1673 and 1682. He founded the first village in the region where the Coxipó River flows into Cuiabá, and named it São Gonçalo Beira-Rio.

[[Pascoal Moreira Cabral]], a bandeirante of [[Sorocaba]], [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]], arrived at the site in 1718 and found it abandoned. He travelled up the Coxipó to enslave indigenous peoples, and fought a battle with the Coxiponé Indians, and lost. The bandeirantes returned down Coxipó, however, found gold, and enslaved indigenous people of the region for mining on the site. Cabral informed the Captaincy of São Paulo of his discovery in a letter dated April 8, 1719. He applied to be "guarda‐mor regente", or guardian and supervisor of the mines. A gold rush immediately followed Cabral's letter with prospectors mainly coming from the São Paulo region. Cabral "manag[ed] disputes and problems of all kinds"<ref name="hpip"/> as guardian of the mines until his death in 1724.

Cuiabá was founded on January 1, 1727 by Rodrigo César de Menezes, then the "captain" of the captaincy of [[São Paulo]] in the aftermath of the discovery of gold mines.<ref name="fernandes"/> It was officially called the ''Vila Real do Senhor Bom Jesus de Cuiabá'', a name taken from the district founded two years earlier.<ref name="ibge"/> The [[Church of Our Lady of the Rosary and Saint Benedict (Cuiabá)|Church of Our Lady of the Rosary]] was built at the time in the centre of the little town marked the location of a rich seam of gold. However, in 1746 much of the town was destroyed by an earthquake. Dom [[Antônio Rolim de Moura Tavares]] (1709–1782), the first Count of Azambuja, arrived in 1751 to serve as governor of the newly created [[Captaincy of Mato Grosso]] by King [[John V of Portugal]]. Tavares served in the position from 1751 to 1765, and founded [[Vila Bela da Santíssima Trindade]] as the new capital of the captaincy.<ref name="menezes"/>

=== 19th century ===

Cuiabá was elevated to township status in 1818. It became the capital of the Province of Mato Grosso in 1835 under the [[Empire of Brazil]], replacing [[Vila Bela da Santíssima Trindade]]. Many residents of Santíssima Trindade left for Cuiabá, leaving behind houses, commercial establishments, and slaves behind in the old capital.<ref name="ibge"/><ref name="menezes"/>

From the late eighteenth century, until the time of the [[Paraguayan War]] (1864–1870), the town remained small and was in decline. The war, however, brought some infrastructure and a brief period of economic boom, with Cuiabá supplying sugar, foodstuffs, and timber to the Brazilian troops. After the war, the town was once again forgotten by the rest of the country, to such an extent that the [[Brazilian Empire|Imperial]] and later the Republican governments of Brazil used to use it as a site of [[exile]] for troublesome politicians. Isolation allowed it to preserve many of the oldest Brazilian ways of life until well into the twentieth century.

=== 20th and 21st century ===

Starting in 1930, the isolation was diminished, with the construction of roads and later with the advent of [[aviation]]. The town became a city and would grow quite rapidly from 1960 onwards, after the establishment of the newly built Brazilian capital in [[Brasília]].<ref name="sidrabaksh.wordpress.com">[http://sidrabaksh.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/adventure-time-10/ Cuiaba History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203042933/http://sidrabaksh.wordpress.com/2013/11/18/adventure-time-10/ |date=2014-02-03 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>

In the 1970s and 1980s, the pace of growth would continue to increase as agriculture became commercialized, using the roads to transport [[soybean]]s and [[rice]] produced in the state in order to be sold abroad. The growth was such that from 1960 to 1980 the small town of 50,000 inhabitants grew into a giant, with more than a quarter of a million inhabitants (including those from the surrounding area and towns).<ref name="sidrabaksh.wordpress.com" />

Since 1990, the rate of population growth has decreased, as other towns in the state have begun to attract more immigration than the capital. Tourism has emerged as a source of income and began to become a relevant area of the country, unlike before, when it was practically uninhabited. In 2023, Cuiabá was already considered one of the ten best cities in the country to live in, according to a [[United Nations|UN]] study; it was also considered the second Brazilian city that most advanced in the last decade.<ref name="sidrabaksh.wordpress.com" /><ref>[https://www.cuiaba.mt.gov.br/governo/e-fato-cada-vez-mais-cuiaba-e-destaque-no-brasil/31429 É fato: cada vez mais, Cuiabá é destaque no Brasil]</ref>

== Geography ==

[[File:Cuiabá - State of Mato Grosso, Brazil - panoramio.jpg|thumb|left|[[Chapada dos Guimarães National Park]], located entirely within the municipality of Cuiabá]]
[[File:Prefeitura de Cuiabá.jpg|thumb|right|Cuiabá [[City Hall]].]]
[[File:Igreja do Bom Despacho3 (Cuiaba).jpg|thumb|right|Church of Our Lady of Good Dispatch (''Igreja da Nossa Senhora de Bom Despacho'')]]
[[File:Ponte_Sérgio_Motta_em_26_de_fevereiro_de_2018.jpg|thumb|Sergio Motta Bridge with Cuiabá in the background|alt=]]

Cuiabá borders the towns of [[Chapada dos Guimarães]], Campo Verde, [[Santo Antônio do Leverger]], [[Várzea Grande, Mato Grosso|Várzea Grande]], [[Jangada]] and Acorizal. The city is an intersection of many major roads and waterways. However, on account of sand banks along the river, these waterways no longer support medium or large ships.

The third most important [[airport]] of the Brazilian Mid-West region is located in Cuiabá, and the city is the centre of an important and productive agricultural region. It is famous throughout Brazil as one of the country's hottest cities, where temperatures are often above 40&nbsp;°C (104&nbsp;°F).

In central Cuiabá, an [[obelisk]] marks the exact center of the South American continent, as calculated in 1909.  However, more accurate measurements in the 1990s located the exact center about {{convert|45|km|mi}} northeast of Cuiabá, near the town of [[Chapada dos Guimarães]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-10-27/the-center-of-south-america-is-in-two-different-spots-here-s-why|title=The Center of South America Is in Two Different Spots—Here's Why|date=27 October 2014|access-date=29 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150803233014/http://www.cntraveler.com/stories/2014-10-27/the-center-of-south-america-is-in-two-different-spots-here-s-why|archive-date=3 August 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The town sits in a transition zone between three of the most characteristic Brazilian ecosystems: [[Amazon biome|Amazon]], [[Cerrado]] and [[Pantanal]]. It is also close to the mountain range known as [[Chapada dos Guimarães]] (which blocks polar masses and causes the extremely hot weather) and the city is also known as the Southern gate to the Amazon.

The municipality contains 11% of the {{convert|3534|ha}} [[Rio da Casca Ecological Station]], a strictly protected conservation unit created in 1994.<ref>{{citation|ref={{harvid|ESEC do Rio da Casca – ISA}}|language=pt|title=ESEC do Rio da Casca|publisher=ISA: Instituto Socioambiental|url=https://uc.socioambiental.org/uc/5331|access-date=2016-07-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101233100/http://uc.socioambiental.org/uc/5331|archive-date=2015-11-01|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Cuiabá has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: Aw). Cuiabá is famous for its searing heat, although temperatures in winter can sometimes drop to {{convert|10|C|F|disp=or}}. This is atypical, caused by cold fronts coming in from the south, and may only last one or two consecutive days then returning to the usual heat. The climate is tropical and humid. Rainfall is concentrated from October to April, the mass of dry air over the center of Brazil inhibiting the rain formation from May to September. The cold fronts dissipates the heat associated with the smoke produced by fires during the dry season. The relative humidity drops to very low levels, sometimes below 15%, increasing cases of respiratory diseases. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|1351.1|mm|in|disp=or}}, with maximum intensity from December to March. The mean maximum temperature reaches {{convert|34|C|F|1|disp=or}}, but the absolute maximum can reach {{convert|40|°C|disp=or}} in hotter months but is muffled on rainy days, when the maximum temperature is typically only {{convert|28|C|F|1|disp=or}}. The average low in July, the coldest month is {{convert|16.6|C|F}} with wind chill of {{convert|10|C|F}}.<ref>[http://www.weather-forecast.com/locations/Cuiaba/forecasts/latest Temperature in Cuiabá] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221222937/http://www.weather-forecast.com/locations/Cuiaba/forecasts/latest |date=2014-02-21 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref>

===Vegetation===

The [[Massairo Okamura State Park]] provides a green space with typical [[cerrado]] vegetation in the centre of a highly urbanized area.
It helps preserve the headwaters of the Barbado and Moinho streams.<ref>{{citation|ref={{harvid|PES Massairo Okamura – ISA}}|language=pt

The city also includes the {{convert|77|ha}} [[Mãe Bonifácia State Park]], created in 2000, also with typical cerrado trees.<ref>{{citation|language=pt|publisher=Conhecendo MT|last=Von Eye|first=Gabriela|title=Parque Mãe Bonifácia: uma pequena floresta dentro de Cuiabá|date=7 January 2013|url=http://conhecendomt.com.br/parque-m%C3%A3e-bonif%C3%A1ciauma-pequena-floresta-dentro-de-cuiab%C3%A1/|access-date=2016-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220074033/http://conhecendomt.com.br/parque-m%C3%A3e-bonif%C3%A1ciauma-pequena-floresta-dentro-de-cuiab%C3%A1/|archive-date=20 December 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>
Cerrado includes various types of vegetation. It is characterized by extensive savanna formations crossed by gallery forests and stream valleys. Humid fields and "buriti" palm paths are found where the water table is near the surface. Alpine pastures occur at higher altitudes and mesophytic forests on more [[fertile soil]]s.

"Cerrado" trees have characteristic twisted trunks covered by a thick bark, and leaves which are usually broad and rigid. Many herbaceous plants have extensive roots to store water and nutrients. The plant's thick bark and roots serve as adaptations for the periodic fires which sweep the cerrado landscape. These adaptations protect the plants from destruction and make them capable of sprouting again after the fire.

== Economy ==

The economy of Cuiabá is concentrated on commerce, services and industry. [[Commerce]] and services based in Cuiabá are important to the whole state, since the population is divided in several small agriculture-centered cities. People from these smaller cities often travel to the capital to access these services and buy goods not sold anywhere else.

The [[Industrial sector|industrial]] sector is represented, basically, by agribusiness, particularly food processing. Many industries, mainly those that should be maintained far from the populous areas, have been set up in the Industrial District of Cuiabá (DIICC), which was founded in 1978. Even though it is located in one of the most agriculturally focused states of Brazil, Cuiabá itself only grows small vegetable farms, mainly family- or cooperative-based.

The city, with a [[GDP]] of 4.75 billion reals in 2003, according to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]], is responsible for 21.99% of the total of the state [[GDP]]. Greater Cuiabá possesses, currently, four shopping centers registered in the HUGS (Brazilian Association of Shopping Centers), and another 8 commercial galleries.

The [[GDP]] for the city was R$7,189,521,000 (2006).<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_impressao.php?id_noticia=1288|title=GDP|publisher=[[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]|location=Cuiabá, Brazil|format=PDF|isbn=85-240-3919-1|year=2006|language=pt|access-date=18 July 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100701054146/http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/presidencia/noticias/noticia_impressao.php?id_noticia=1288|archive-date=1 July 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[File:Cidade_Alta,_Cuiabá_-_MT,_Brazil_-_panoramio_(3).jpg|thumb|right|[[Arena Pantanal]].]]
Cuiabá was one of 12 cities chosen to host games of the 2014 FIFA World Cup, which took place in Brazil. The games were to be played at the [[Arena Pantanal]], a stadium completed in April 2014, with a capacity of 42,968. The stadium hosted four group matches in the tournament.
<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium=5025112/index.html|title=Arena Pantanal: the stadiums for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil |last=FIFA.com|access-date=2017-10-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407210821/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/destination/stadiums/stadium=5025112/index.html|archive-date=2018-04-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>

It replaced the old Estádio José Fragelli (Verdão), which used to be the principal football stadium of the city. Verdão got demolished in 2010, and works on the new stadium commenced later that year. The [[architect]]s GCP Arquitetos have focused strongly on [[sustainability]] and one of the stadium's noticeable features are the plants and trees that fill the four corner areas. Following completion, the stadium has become the permanent home of local sides [[Mixto EC]] and [[Cuiabá EC]].<ref>[http://www.stadiumguide.com/arenapantanal/ Arena Pantanal] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106034516/http://www.stadiumguide.com/arenapantanal/ |date=2014-01-06 }} {{in lang|en}}</ref> Next to the football stadium is the Tocantins Gymnasium - [[Ginásio Aecim Tocantins]].

The stadium has a [[car park]] of 15,000 spaces. Local side Mixto hold the record for most state titles, having won the Campeonato Mato-Grossense on 24 occasions. Mixto are also the only club from Mato Grosso to have played at the top level of [[Brazilian football]], the [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brasileirão]], in 1976 and 1986. Even more contested than [[Manaus]] as a [[FIFA World Cup]] host city, Cuiabá represents both the positive and negative of Brazil's hosting of the event. Negative because it is a relatively small, remote city with no great footballing tradition, best as its inclusion shows that the World Cup, geographically speaking at least, will be an event for all of Brazil and not just in the east coast capitals.<ref>[http://espnfc.com/news/story/_/id/1584747/venue-guide-arena-pantanal-cuiaba-2014-world-cup-stadium-brazil?cc=3888 Venue Guide - Cuiaba] {{in lang|en}}</ref>
