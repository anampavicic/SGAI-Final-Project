'''Rason''' (formerly '''Rajin-Sŏnbong'''; {{IPA|ko|ɾa.sʌ̹n, ɾa.dʑin.sʰʌ̹n.boŋ}}) is a North Korean [[Special cities of North Korea|special city]] and [[Port#Warm-water port|ice-free port]]<ref name="Rason SEZ">{{cite web|title=Report on Rason Special Economic Zone|url=http://chosonexchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Choson-Exchange-Rason-Report-August.pdf|publisher=Choson Exchange|access-date=9 December 2012|author=Andray Abrahamian|date=September 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417055346/http://chosonexchange.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/Choson-Exchange-Rason-Report-August.pdf|archive-date=17 April 2012}}</ref> in the [[Sea of Japan]] in the [[North Pacific Ocean]] on the northeast tip of [[North Korea]]. It is in the [[Kwanbuk]] region and location of the [[Rason Special Economic Zone]].

In [[South Korea]]n [[North–South differences in the Korean language#Consonants|pronunciation]], the initial "R" of the name is pronounced as "N", (나선, ''Naseon'') as per standard [[Korean phonology]]. In 2000, the name was shortened from "Rajin-Sŏnbong" to "Rason". During the 1930s, the Japanese called it Rashin; at that time, it was an important port at the end of a railroad line. It fell under the control of the [[Red Army]] on 14 August 1945.

Before 1991, Rason was used by the [[Soviet Union]] as an alternative [[warm-water port]] in case [[Vladivostok]] was unavailable.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Soviet Union and Asia in 1981|first=Thomas W.|last=Robinson|journal=Asian Survey|volume=22|number=1|pages=20 |series=A Survey of Asia in 1981: Part I |date=January 1982 |doi=10.2307/2643707 |jstor=2643707 }}</ref> The Soviet naval facilities were built starting in 1979.<ref>{{Cite book |editor1-first=H.

Prior to 1993 and from 2004 to 2009, the city had been part of the North Hamgyŏng Province. Since 2010, the city is a "special city", again breaking from provincial control, but different from its older designation as a directly governed city.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&num=5866 |title=Rasun Becomes Special City |publisher=Daily NK |date=5 January 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322233911/http://www.dailynk.com/english/read.php?cataId=nk01500&num=5866 |archive-date=22 March 2012}}</ref> What this means in practice is unclear.
