[[File:高岡市街の夜景 - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Downtown]] Takaoka at night]]
{{nihongo|'''Takaoka'''|高岡市|Takaoka-shi}} is a city in the northwestern portion of [[Toyama Prefecture]], Japan. Takaoka has the second largest population after [[Toyama, Toyama|Toyama City]].

Takaoka is a center of western Toyama Prefecture. Western Toyama Prefecture is called "Gosei" (呉西) meaning the west of {{nihongo|Kureha hill|呉羽丘陵|Kureha-kyuryo}}, meanwhile eastern Toyama Prefecture is called "Goto" (呉東) meaning the east of Kureha hill.

{{As of|2018}}, the city had an estimated population of 173,086 in 68,350 households and a population density of 819 persons per km<sup>2</sup>. Its total area was {{convert|209.57|sqkm|sqmi}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.city.takaoka.toyama.jp/joho/shise/gaiyo/gaiyo.html#m01|title=official home page statistics}}</ref>

==Geography==
Takaoka covers an area which equates to roughly 5% of the surface area of Toyama Prefecture. The surface area of the city comprises 36.96&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of real estate, 61.02&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of agricultural land, 22.69&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of mountains and forests, 80.43&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of public property (parks etc.), 6.10&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of wasteland, and 2.18&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of moorland.<ref>Takaoka City Development and Planning Department, Public Affairs and Statistics Section, "Takaoka Mini Data 2011". Takaoka City, 2011</ref>

The Takaoka region extends {{convert|19.2|km}} from north to south, {{convert|24.5|km}} from east to west with a perimeter of 125.9&nbsp;km – which is roughly equal to the length of coastline in Toyama Prefecture (147 m). Takaoka borders four cities in Toyama Prefecture ([[Himi, Toyama|Himi]], [[Oyabe, Toyama|Oyabe]], [[Tonami, Toyama|Tonami]], and [[Imizu, Toyama|Imizu]]) and two towns in Ishikawa Prefecture ([[Tsubata, Ishikawa|Tsubata]] and [[Hōdatsushimizu, Ishikawa|Hōdatsushimizu]]).

From its border with Himi down to the southwest area of the city, a range of mountains stretch for roughly 150 m to 300 m with a particularly high stretch of mountains centering on Mt. Futagami near Himi. Shogawa River and the Oyabegawa River run through Takaoka, and tributaries weave their way through the city center. Including small rivers, a total of 10 rivers flow through the city. The Amaharashi coast lies to the north of the region. Just off the coast lies the uninhabited offshore rock of Otokoiwa. Another uninhabited rock, Onnaiwa, lies nearby, and the view of this island against the backdrop of the [[Mount Tate|Tateyama]] range of peaks is famous and features in promotional media for the region.<ref>Hot Hot Takaoka, http://www.city.takaoka.toyama.jp</ref> A section of the Imizu plains runs from the central district of the city to the eastern district, and the Tonami plains which stretch from the west to the south are dotted with [[dispersed settlement]]s in certain areas.

===Climate===
The climate of Takaoka is a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''), similar to that of much of the [[Sea of Japan]] coast. All of the regions in Toyama Prefecture can experience large quantities of snow in winter. Depending on the year, the city can experience extraordinarily heavy snowfall, like, for example in 2006 when snow 1.4m high, and in 2011 1.27m was recorded. According to weather records, the average temperature in 2010 was {{convert|14.5|°C}}, the average level of humidity was 79%, the yearly rainfall was roughly 2,665.5mm and there were 1,634 hours of sunlight.<ref>Takaoka City Development and Planning Department, Public Affairs and Statistics Section, Takaoka Mini Data 2011, Takaoka City, 2011</ref>

===Foreign population===
{{As of|2011}}, the Brazilian population of Takaoka was approximately 1,430 residents, the Chinese population was approximately 700, and the Philippine population was approximately 360.<ref>Takaoka City Development and Planning Department, Public Affairs and Statistics Section, Takaoka Shisei Gaiyō Tōkei Sho （高岡市政概要統計書）, Takaoka City, 2010</ref>

==History==
The area of present-day Takaoka was part of ancient [[Etchū Province]], and the [[kokufu|provincial capital]] was located in what are now the outskirts of the modern city. [[Ōtomo no Yakamochi]] took office as a government official in this area in the 8th century. During his five-year stay, he wrote many [[waka (poetry)|''waka'' poems]].<ref>{{Cite web
  | url =  https://www.britannica.com/biography/Otomo-Yakamochi
  | title = Ōtomo Yakamochi - Japanese poet - Britannica.com
  | publisher = Encyclopedia Britannica
  | access-date = 2018-04-06}}</ref> This is the reason for Takaoka being nicknamed [[Man'yōshū|Manyō City]].

Originally, the Takaoka region was called ''Sekino'', but when [[Maeda Toshinaga]] of [[Kaga Domain]] took control of the city in 1609, he named it after a verse from the religious poem ''Shihen'' which includes the word ''Takaoka''. In addition to this, the fact that [[Takaoka Castle]] was built on a slightly elevated shoreline is thought to be another possible origin for the name Takaoka, since ''Taka'' means "high" and "Oka" means "hill or elevated land".

Despite the loss of its castle due to orders from the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] in 1615, the [[Maeda clan]] pursued policies regulating the relocation of Takaoka citizens and promoting the development of Takaoka as an industrial city. This resulted in the start of Takaoka's role as a city of commerce and industry. Takaoka copperware and lacquerware also took off at this time.
Following the [[Meiji restoration]], with the establishment of the municipalities system on April 1, 1889, Takaoka was registered as one of Japan's first 30 cities.<ref>Takaoka City Editorial Committee, Takaoka Rekishi to no Deai （歴史との出会い）, Takaoka City, 1991, p.239</ref> The area around Fushiki Port was declared an open port for foreign trade by Imperial decree in July 1899.<ref>US Department of State. (1906). [https://books.google.com/books?id=dKCOAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA759&dq=  ''A digest of international law as embodied in diplomatic discussions, treaties and other international agreements'' (John Bassett Moore, ed.), Vol. 5, p. 759].</ref>

On November 1, 2005, the town of [[Fukuoka, Toyama|Fukuoka]] (from [[Nishitonami District, Toyama|Nishitonami District]]) was merged into Takaoka. Nishitonami District was dissolved as a result of this merger.<ref>{{Cite web

==Government==
Takaoka has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor, and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 27 members. The city contributes seven members to the Toyama Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the Toyama Third Electoral District for the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Education==
===Colleges and universities===
*[[University of Toyama]] – Takaoka campus
*[[Takaoka University of Law]]

===Primary and secondary education===
Takaoka has 26 public elementary schools and 12 public junior high schools operated by the town government, and eight public high schools operated by the Toyama Prefectural Board of Education. There are also three private high schools. The city also operates one special education school,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.city.takaoka.toyama.jp/school/kosodate/gakko/gakkosyozaichi.html|title=高岡市／学校所在地等一覧|website=www.city.takaoka.toyama.jp}}</ref> and an additional four special education schools are operated by the Toyama Prefectural government.
