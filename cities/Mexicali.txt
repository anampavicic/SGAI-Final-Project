'''Mexicali''' ({{IPAc-en|lang|pron|ˌ|m|ɛ|k|s|ɪ|ˈ|k|æ|l|i}}; {{IPA|es|mexiˈkali|lang|MexicaliPronunciation.ogg}})<ref>[[John C. Wells|J. C. Wells]] (2000) ''Longman Pronunciation Dictionary.'' Harlow, Essex: Pearson, p. 478.</ref>  is the capital city of the [[States of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Baja California]]. The city, which is the seat of the [[Mexicali Municipality]], has a population of 689,775, according to the 2010 census, while the [[Calexico–Mexicali|Calexico–Mexicali metropolitan area]] is home to 1,000,000 inhabitants on both sides of the [[Mexico–United States border]]. Mexicali is a regional economic and cultural hub for the border region of [[The Californias]].

Mexicali was founded at the turn of the 20th century, when the region's agricultural economy experienced a period of boom. The city rapidly expanded throughout the 20th century, owing to the proliferation of [[maquiladora]]s in the city, making the Mexicali economy more interconnected with businesses from across the border. Today, Mexicali is a major manufacturing center and an emerging tourist destination.

== History ==
[[File:Cervecería Mexicali, 1920's (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Cervecería Mexicali in the 1920s]]
The Spaniards arrived in the area after crossing the [[Sonoran Desert]]'s "[[Camino del Diablo]]" or Devil's Road. This led to the evangelization of the area by Catholic missionaries and also to the reduction of native populations in the region. Nowadays, indigenous [[Cocopah]] people still inhabit a small government-protected corner of the Colorado River delta near the junction of the [[Hardy River|Hardy]] and the Colorado. The Cocopah mostly work on agricultural [[ejido]]s or fishing.<ref name="bajaweb">{{cite web |url=http://www.baja-web.com/mexicali/mexicali.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991128085610/http://baja-web.com/mexicali/mexicali.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=November 28, 1999 |title=Baja Web Mexicali |access-date=2008-11-02}}</ref>

The early European presence in this area was limited to [[Juan Bautista de Anza|Anza]]'s and subsequent Spanish expeditions across the [[Colorado Desert]] and subsequent travelers on the [[Sonora Road]] opened by them. Also the presence of the [[Jesuits]] who attempted to establish a mission in what is now Fort Yuma. They left after a revolt by the [[Quechan people|Yuma]] in 1781. After this, the Spanish had little to do with the northeastern corner of the [[Baja California Peninsula]], perceiving it as an untamable, flood-prone desert delta.<ref name="bajaweb" /> Later in the 1820s, the Mexican authorities reopened the Sonoran Road and restored peaceful relations with the Yuma People.<ref>George William Beattie, "Reopened the Anza Road", ''The Pacific Historical Review'', Vol. 2, No. 1. (Mar., 1933), pp. 52–71</ref>

===19th century===
In the mid-19th century, a geologist working for the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] came to the delta area, discovering what the native Yumans had known for centuries: that the thick river sediment deposits made the area prime farming land. These sediments extended far to the west of the river itself, accumulating in a shallow basin below the Sierra de Cucapá.<ref name="bajaweb" /> However, from this time period until the 1880s, the area was almost completely unpopulated, mostly due to its harsh climate. In 1888, the federal government granted a large part of northern Baja California state, including Mexicali, to Guillermo Andrade, with the purpose of colonizing the area on the recently created border with the United States. However, around 1900, the only area with any real population, aside from the Cocopah, were concentrated in [[Los Algodones]], to the east of Mexicali.<ref name="EncMuc">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/bajacalifornia/municipios/02002a.htm |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios Baja California Mexicali |access-date=2008-11-03 |language=es |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414235817/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/bajacalifornia/municipios/02002a.htm |archive-date=2012-04-14}}</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:Mexicali, 1943.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown Mexicali in the 1940s]]
[[File:Catedral de Nuestra Señora Guadalupe.png|thumb|right|upright|The Cathedral of Our Lady of Guadalupe began construction in 1918.]]
In 1900, the U.S.-based [[California Development Company]] received permission from the government of [[Porfirio Díaz|Díaz]] to cut a [[Alamo Canal|canal]] through the delta's Arroyo Alamo, to link the dry basin with the [[Colorado River]]. To attract farmers to the area, the developers named it the "[[Imperial Valley]]". In 1903, the first 500 farmers arrived; by late 1904, 405&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (100,000 acres) of valley were irrigated, with 10,000 people settled on the land harvesting cotton, fruits, and vegetables. The concentration of small housing units that straddled the border was called Calexico on the U.S. side and Mexicali on the Mexican side.<ref name="bajaweb" /> Led by ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' publisher [[Harry Chandler]], one company controlled 800,000 hectares of land in northern Baja California by 1905, and began to build the irrigation system for the Valley. However, instead of using Mexican labor to dig the ditches, Chandler brought in thousands of Chinese laborers.<ref name="bajaweb" /> Mexicali became culturally Chinese influenced.

The Mexican side was named Mexicali (a [[portmanteau]] composed of "Mexico" and "California") by Coronel Agustín Sanguinéz. Initially the area belonged to the municipality of [[Ensenada Municipality|Ensenada]].<ref name="EncMuc" /> The town of Mexicali was officially created on 14 March 1903 when [[Manuel Vizcarra]] was named as the town's first authority and Assistant Judge (''juez auxiliar'').<ref name="bajaweb" /> On January 29, 1911, Mexicali was [[Capture of Mexicali|briefly "liberated" by the Liberal Party of Mexico]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]]. Mayor Baltazar Aviléz declared the municipality of Mexicali on November 4, 1914, and called for elections to creation of the first [[ayuntamiento]] or municipality, which was then headed by Francisco L. Montejano.<ref name="EncMuc" />

In the 20th century, the Colorado Riverland Company, a U.S.-based company, was dedicated to renting Mexican land to farmers; however, these farmers were almost always foreigners, such as Chinese, East Indians and Japanese. Mexicans were employed only as seasonal laborers. This situation led to the agrarian conflict known as the "{{ill|El Asalto a las Tierras|es|lt=Asalto a las Tierras}}" (Assault on the Lands) in 1937.<ref name="EncMuc" /> in which Mexican land was taken by Mexicans.
[[File:EscuelaCuauhtemocMexicali.JPG|thumb|left|Cuauhtémoc School in the 1950s]]
Agricultural production continued to increase during the 20th century. Cotton became the most important crop and helped develop the textile industry. In the early 1950s, the Mexicali Valley became the biggest cotton-producing zone in the country and in the 1960s, production reached more than half a million parcels a year. 

The first factories appeared in the 1960s with the end of the Bracero program. A 1988 study found 100 factories in the city, including 10 electronics manufacturers, 25 auto parts manufacturers, 27 textile plants and nine plastics companies. Most maquiladoras are run by US companies, followed by Mexican, South Korean, and Japanese companies.<ref name=sol />

===21st century===
Today Mexicali is an important center for [[maquiladora]] (assembly plant) production in the automotive, aerospace, telecommunications, metallurgical, and health items as well as manufacturing and exporting products to various countries.<ref name="Mexicali History">{{cite web |title=Mexicali History |publisher=Trust for Mexicali Tourism |url=https://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&prev=_t&hl=en&ie=UTF-8&layout=2&eotf=1&sl=es&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mexicaliturismo.com%2Fesp%2Fpages%2Fmexicali.php%3Fidweb%3D1 |access-date=March 10, 2011}}</ref>

===Ecology===
Despite its arid desert location, Mexicali is watered through a system of aquifers in the valley. Under a [[1944 water treaty]], the city is "guaranteed an annual quantity of {{convert|1,500,000|acre.ft|km3}} [of water] to be delivered" from the [[Colorado River]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://crc.nv.gov/1944mexicanwatertreaty.htm |title=The Mexican Water Treaty |publisher=Crc.nv.gov |access-date=2011-06-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091217211309/http://crc.nv.gov/1944mexicanwatertreaty.htm |archive-date=2009-12-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, a proposed concrete lining in the United States on the All-American Canal would cut off billions of leaked gallons of water, which is used to irrigate onions, alfalfa, asparagus, squash and other crops in Mexicali.<ref>{{cite news |last=Archibold |first=Randal C. |work=The New York Times |title=Border Fight Focuses on Water, Not Immigration |date=July 7, 2006 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/07/us/07border.html?scp=8&sq=mexicali&st=nyt |access-date=2008-06-19}}</ref>

===Climate===
Because of its low annual precipitation, Mexicali has an [[arid climate]] (''BWh''), featuring long, extremely hot summers and mild to warm winters. Under the criteria for the [[Köppen climate classification]], Mexicali maintains desert weather temperatures every year, receiving only {{convert|70.9|mm}} of precipitation annually over 16 precipitation days on average. On December 12, 1932, the city experienced snowfall.<ref>{{cite news|author=<!--not stated-->|title=Weather breaks 30-year precedent by blanketing Imperial Valley in snow|url=https://cdnc.ucr.edu/?a=d&d=CC19321213|work=Calexico Chronicle|location=Calexico, California|date=December 13, 1932|access-date=July 16, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mexicali686.com/nevada-en-mexicali.html|website=Mexicali686|title=El día que nevó en Mexicali|lang=es}}</ref> Rainfall usually occurs in the winter months of December, January and February. Summer rainfall in the city is infrequent, although in some years thunderstorms and the remnants of tropical storms and hurricanes passing over Baja California from the Pacific can sometimes drop heavy rainfall (most likely in August and September). A notable example was [[Hurricane Kathleen (1976)|Hurricane Kathleen]] in 1976, which dropped several inches of rain in the area. During winter time, Mexicali is affected by the snow storms that pass by the town of [[La Rumorosa]] located in the [[Sierra de Juárez]], about 45 minutes west of the city, causing a decrease in temperature that lasts from two days to one week. July is the hottest month with a mean at {{convert|33.9|C|F|abbr=on}} and an average high at {{convert|42.3|C|F|abbr=on}}, while January is the coolest month with a mean at {{convert|13.1|C|F|abbr=on}} and an average low at {{convert|5.8|C|F|abbr=on}}.

On 28 July 1995, the Mexicali area recorded a temperature of {{convert|52.0|C|F|abbr=on}}, which is the highest temperature ever recorded in Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/early-summer-heat-broils-northern-hemisphere.html|author=Christopher Burt|title=Early Summer Heat Broils Northern Hemisphere|access-date=19 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319151445/https://www.wunderground.com/blog/weatherhistorian/early-summer-heat-broils-northern-hemisphere.html|archive-date=19 March 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=García Cueto |first1=O.R. |last2=Santillán Soto |first2=N. |last3=Quintero Núñez |first3=M. |last4=Ojeda Benítez |first4=S. |last5=Velázquez Limón |first5=N. |title=Extreme temperature scenarios in Mexicali, Mexico under climate change conditions |journal=Atmósfera |date=October 2013 |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=509–520 |doi=10.1016/S0187-6236(13)71092-0 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

As of 2020, the city of Mexicali had a population of 854,186.<ref name="INEGI">{{cite web|title=Mexicali|url=https://www.inegi.org.mx/contenidos/productos/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/nueva_estruc/702825197735.pdf|language=es|access-date=6 February 2024}}</ref>

The city itself had a 2005 census population of 653,046, whereas the [[Mexicali Municipality|municipality]]'s population was 895,962. It is the 13th largest municipality in Mexico as of the Census 2005 with population estimates exceeding one million alone. 

The population is constantly growing due to the number of [[maquiladora]]s in the area, lack of urban planning, and migrational aspects, like seasonal labor and the constant in-and-out flow of immigrants to the U.S. or into Mexico.

==Economy==
Mexicali's economy has been historically based on agricultural products, and they remain a large sector of the economy. However, its economy has gradually gone from being agricultural to include industry, mainly [[maquiladora]]s—duty-free factories in which parts from the [[United States]] are imported, assembled, and then returned to the United States as finished products. Currently, the [[Mexicali Valley]] still is one of Mexico's most productive agricultural regions, mostly producing wheat, cotton and vegetables. The city is one of Mexico's most important exporters of asparagus, broccoli, carrots, green onions, lettuce, peas, peppers, radishes and tomatoes to the world.<ref name="bajaweb"/> 
[[File:Cervecería Mexicali 0046 (3086417790) (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|The historic Cervecería Mexicali]] 
In its beginnings Mexicali was an important center for cotton production for export, until synthetic fabrics reduced the worldwide demand for the fiber. Currently, horticulture is the most successful agricultural activity with scallion (green onion), and asparagus being among the most important crops. Cotton and wheat are still grown, but low government price guarantees and subsidies make wheat farmer protests an annual event. There is an annual agri-business fair, which if unfunded by the government, would have been dead a decade ago, named AGROBAJA, [http://www.agrobaja.com Agrobaja] in March of every year, drawing people by the thousands, from all over Mexico and before the crisis, from the United States.

The current prospects for economic growth in Mexicali rely on in-bond and assembly plants (maquiladoras), which come due to low wages and loose worker right laws, include companies like, [[Selther]], [[Daewoo Electronics]], [[Mitsubishi]], [[Honeywell]], [[Paccar]], [[Vitro]], [[Skyworks Solutions]], [[CareFusion]], [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], [[Price Pfister]], [[Gulfstream Aerospace|Gulfstream]], [[United Technologies Corporation]], [[Kenworth]], [[Kwikset]] and [[Collins Aerospace]]. Mexicali is also home to many food processing plants such as [[Nestlé]], [[Jumex]], [[Grupo Bimbo|Bimbo]], [[The Coca-Cola Company|Coca-Cola]], [[Kellogg's]], and [[Sabritas]]. In December 2018 there were 180 in all, employing 70,000 people.<ref name=sol />

Mexicali became the national center for the aerospace industry in Mexico when [[Rockwell Collins]] established an operation there in 1966. Rockwell Collins is the oldest company under the [[maquiladora]] program nationwide.

===Silicon Border===
[[File:Punta Este Mexicali 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Development in Punta Este]]
{{Main|Silicon Border}}
Silicon Border is an empty {{convert|40|km2|acre|adj=on|sp=us}} development supposedly tailored to the specific needs of high-technology manufacturing and is situated in the outskirts of Mexicali, along the western border of the U.S. and Mexico.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconborder.com/semiconductors.html |title=Silicon Border |publisher=Silicon Border |date=2004-07-14 |access-date=2011-06-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716071121/http://www.siliconborder.com/semiconductors.html |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The aim of the empty manufacturing park, which began in 2004, was to transform Mexicali into the world's next semiconductor manufacturing center, if the world economy was fine. The Mexican federal and Baja California state governments have given away $2 million of public money to private hands, without a referendum for the design of the project and the laying of a few streets and lamp posts that can be seen on the premises as the only work done. Neither authorities nor the private frontmen of the project have given the public any account on what the public money was spent on. Former president [[Vicente Fox]] offered ten years of a tax rate as low as 3% to foreign-owned factories.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconborder.com/location-incentives |title=Incentives |publisher=Silicon Border Development |year=2012 |access-date=2014-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307153814/http://siliconborder.com/location-incentives |archive-date=2014-03-07 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The premises sit empty as of October 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/545/sili097.jpg/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222225947/http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/545/sili097.jpg/|url-status=dead|archive-date=February 22, 2014|title=sili097.jpg – Click to see more photos|website=ImageShack}}</ref>

Mexicali also relies on tourism as a medium to generate revenue, and visitors cross by foot or by car from [[Calexico, California|Calexico]], United States, every day. Tourists are mainly attracted to local [[taco stand]]s, restaurants, pharmacies, bars and dance clubs. Near the border, in walking distance, there are many shops and stalls selling Mexican curios and souvenirs. Arizona and Nevada residents look for medical and dental services in Mexicali, since they tend to be less expensive than in the United States. Pharmacies sell some drugs without a prescription and at much lower cost than in the US, but some medications still require a doctor's prescription, although several accessible doctor offices are located near the border as well.

Mexico's drinking age is 18 years old (vs. 21 in the United States) which makes it a common weekend destination for many high school and college students from Southern California.

Mexicali hosts [[Baja Prog]], one of the world's most important events in [[progressive rock]].
[[File:Hoteles Lucerna .jpg|thumb|right|Resort hotel in Mexicali]]
Mexicali hosts four main shopping malls, the most visited being Plaza La Cachanilla, located a mile away from the US border. The mall hosts a variety of shops, which sell a wide array of items, ranging from cheap Mexican curios to expensive imports. The Plaza La Cachanilla also represents a common place for people to socialize, especially during summer days when the weather reaches high temperatures, many families come and spend the day inside the air-conditioned mall.

For recreation, Mexicali has bath halls, bowling alleys, traditional cantinas, car clubs, strip clubs, movie theaters, museums, a zoo, a convention center, supermarkets, and fast food restaurants for every choice of food.

Galerias del Valle, holds a [[Walmart de México y Centroamérica|WalMart]] Supercenter, a twelve-screen Cinepolis movie theater, two casinos, a food court, and  a large array of stores that sell many items needed for daily living. It is located on Boulevard Lázaro Cárdenas at Calle 11.

===La Chinesca===
{{Main|La Chinesca}}
The city claimed to have the largest per capita concentration of residents of Chinese origin in Mexico, around 5,000 until 2012 when the [[La Mesa (Tijuana)|Tijuana La Mesa District]] surpassed that number at 15,000 Chinese immigrants. The [[Chinese immigration to Mexico|Chinese immigrants]] came to the area as laborers for the Colorado River Land Company, an American enterprise which designed and built an extensive irrigation system in the Valley of Mexicali. Some immigrants came from the United States, often fleeing anti-Chinese policies there, while others sailed directly from China. Thousands of Chinese were lured to the area by the promise of high wages, but that never materialized.<ref name="CPA">{{cite web|last=Cummings |first=Joe |url=http://www.cpamedia.com/history/sharks_fin_tacos/ |title=Mexicali's Chinatown: Sharks fin Tacos and Barbecued Chow Mein |access-date=2008-10-25 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090207122604/http://www.cpamedia.com/history/sharks_fin_tacos/ |archive-date=2009-02-07}}</ref>

Since 2000, new migrants from China to Mexicali come from many of the same areas as before 1960, with perhaps 90% from Guangdong or Hong Kong.<ref>Auyón Gerardo, Eduardo. 2003.
