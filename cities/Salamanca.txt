'''Salamanca''' ({{IPA|es|salaˈmaŋka|lang|Pronunciation_of_Salamanca_in_Spanish.ogg}}) is a [[Municipality of Spain|municipality]] and city in [[Spain]], capital of the [[Province of Salamanca|province of the same name]], located in the autonomous community of [[Castile and León]]. It is located in the [[Campo Charro]] comarca, in the [[Meseta Norte]], in the northwestern quadrant of the [[Iberian Peninsula]]. It has a population of 144,436 registered inhabitants ([[National Institute of Statistics (Spain)|INE]] 2017). Its [[Área funcional estable|stable functional area]] reaches 203,999 citizens, which makes it the second most populated in the autonomous community, after [[Valladolid]]. Salamanca is known for its large number of remarkable [[Plateresque]]-style buildings.

The origins of the city date back to about 2700 years ago, during the first [[Iron Age]], when the first settlers of the city settled on the [[Cerro de San Vicente Archaeological Park (Salamanca)|San Vicente hill]], on the banks of the [[Tormes]]. Since then, the metropolis has witnessed the passage of various peoples: [[Vaccaei]], [[Vettones]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Visigoths]] and [[Muslims]]. [[Raymond of Burgundy]], son-in-law of King [[Alfonso VI of León and Castile|Alfonso VI of León]], was in charge of repopulating the city during the Middle Ages and laying the foundations of modern-day Salamanca.

Salamanca is home to the oldest active university in Spain, the [[University of Salamanca]], founded in 1218 by [[Alfonso IX of León]] on the germ of its [[studium generale]], and which was the first in Europe to hold the title of university by royal decree of [[Alfonso X of Castile]] dated November 9, 1252 and by the ''licentia ubique docendi'' of [[Pope Alexander IV]] of 1255. During the time when it was one of the most prestigious universities in the West, the phrase ''[[Quod natura non dat, Salmantica non præstat]]'', ''What nature does not give, Salamanca does not lend'', became popular. Salamanca is linked to universal history by names such as [[Antonio de Nebrija]], [[Christopher Columbus]], [[Fernando de Rojas]], [[Francisco de Vitoria]] and the [[School of Salamanca]], friar [[Luis de León]], [[Beatriz Galindo]] and [[Miguel de Unamuno]].

In 1988, the [[Old City of Salamanca]] was declared a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain|World Heritage Site by UNESCO]]. It has an important historical-architectural heritage, among which stand out its two cathedrals - the [[Old Cathedral of Salamanca|Old cathedral]] and the [[New Cathedral of Salamanca|New cathedral]], the [[Casa de las Conchas]], the [[Plaza Mayor, Salamanca|Plaza Mayor]], the [[Convento de San Esteban, Salamanca|Convento de San Esteban]] and the [[Escuelas Mayores]]. Since 2003, [[Holy Week in Salamanca]] has been declared of [[Fiestas of International Tourist Interest of Spain|international tourist interest]].

Salamanca is home to important scientific institutions and research centers, such as the [[Cancer Research Center, Salamanca|Cancer Research Center]], the [[Institute of Neurosciences of Castile and León]], the Center for Water Research and Technological Development and the Ultra-Short Ultra-Intense Pulsed Laser Center. The city and [[metropolitan area of Salamanca|its metropolitan area]], host some of the largest companies, by turnover, in the autonomous community of Castile and León. In addition, it is considered to be a world reference in the teaching of [[Spanish language]], since it concentrates 78% of the existing offer in its autonomous community, which represents 16% of the national market.

== Toponymy ==

The origin of the toponym Salamanca is not clear. Greeks [[Polybius|Polybius of Megalopolis]] and Stephanus called the city Helmantike, Greek name that for them meant "Land of divination". On the other hand, [[Ptolemy]] appeals to a [[polis]] dominated by the [[Vaccei]]s with the name of Salmatica or Salmantica. Roman [[Livy]] and [[Plutarch]] will call it Hermandica and [[Polyaenus]] calls it Salmantida or Salmatis. Other historians even call it Selium and Sentica.

On the other hand, some others like [[Justin (historian)|Justin]] and later Rui Méndez or Murillo attributed the creation of the city to [[Teucer]], son of Telamon, king of [[Salamis,_Cyprus|Salamis]], who after being defeated in the [[Trojan War]], came to the Iberian Peninsula and founded a city, which remembering his homeland he would call Salamatica. Another theory that can be resorted to is that of the existence of a god of the first inhabitants -nomadic shepherds and Neolithic farmers- called Helman, whose name derived from the toponym Helmantica.

The philologist [[Martín Ruipérez Sánchez|Martín S. Ruipérez]] contributes a new interpretative line that is summarized in that "the first element of Salamanca, ''sala-'' is the designation of the ford of a river", "''sal-'' and ''hel-'' cannot be linguistically related one from the other" and regarding the second element ''-manca'' "where some believe to see the same element in the toponym [[Talamanca de Jarama|Talamanca (de Jarama)]] which, in turn, would coincide in its first element with Talavera, and in [[Simancas]], all of which is undemonstrable".

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Salamanca}}

=== Salamanca in the universal history ===
Salamanca has been linked to Universal History by a series of events and personalities that came to mark the evolution of Western society:

* The creation of the first grammar of [[Spanish language]] in 1492 by [[Antonio de Nebrija]], the famous ''[[Gramática de la lengua castellana]]''. It was the first study of the rules of a Western European language other than [[Latin]] and this fact marks the beginning of the [[Spanish Golden Age]].
* The preparations of [[Christopher Columbus]] for his first voyage in the [[History of the Americas|European discovery of the Americas]]. The Cloister of the [[University of Salamanca]] met in council to discuss his project. During these years, Columbus obtained the support of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]], staying at the [[Convento de San Esteban, Salamanca|Convento de San Esteban]]. The Salamanca astronomer [[Abraham Zacuto]] was his great scientific support for the trip.
* The years of study of [[Hernán Cortés]] before leaving for the Americas and conquering the [[Aztec Empire]].
* The defense of the rights of the natives of the [[New World]] by the [[School of Salamanca]], which, with [[Francisco de Vitoria]] at its head, reformulated the concept of [[natural law]], renewed [[theology]], laid the foundations of modern law of nations, [[international law]] and modern economic science, and actively participated in the [[Council of Trent]].
* At this Council, mathematicians from the [[University of Salamanca]] proposed to Pope [[Gregory XIII]] the calendar that came to be known as the [[Gregorian calendar]] and is currently used all over the world. The germ was two studies carried out in 1515 and 1578 by scientists at the university, which were submitted to the church.
* The partial translation of the Bible into Spanish, made by [[Luis de León|Friar Luis de León]].
* The oldest preserved printed book on modern [[chess]], ''Repetición de amores y arte de ajedrez'', by the religious [[Luis Ramírez de Lucena]], published in Salamanca in 1496.
* The stay of [[Miguel de Cervantes]], a possible student at the university, which influenced his books: ''[[Cueva de Salamanca|La Cueva de Salamanca]]'', ''[[Don Quixote|Don Quixote of la Mancha]]'' in which he makes references to Salamanca through the character of the bachelor Sansón Carrasco, ''La tía fingida'' and ''[[El licenciado Vidriera]]''.

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Salamanca. Cerro de San Vicente - 2.jpg|thumb|Remains of a house at the Cerro de San Vicente Archaeological Park ({{circa|800}}–400 BC), a hamlet assigned to the Early [[Iron Age]]<ref>{{cite journal |first1=Antonio |last1=Blanco-González |first2=Carlos |last2=Macarro Alcalde |first3=Cristina |last3=Alario García |url=http://www.aranzadi.eus/fileadmin/docs/Munibe/maa.2017.68.15.pdf |publisher=Aranzadi Zientzia Elkartea |title=La aldea del Hierro Inicial del Cerro de San Vicente (Salamanca, España): Resultados de las excavaciones entre 1990 y 2006 a la luz de algunos debates actuales |journal=Munibe Antropologia-Arkeologia |issue=68 |pages=217–236 |location=San Sebastián, Spain |year=2017 |issn=1132-2217}}</ref>]]
The first human habitat in the Salamanca area has been dated to the beginning of the first millennium BC. This is attested by the ceramic remains found in the "[[Cerro de San Vicente Archaeological Park (Salamanca)|San Vicente hill]]" and which have been ascribed to the [[Las Cogotas|Las Cogotas I]] culture of the [[Bronze Age|Final Bronze Age]]. In this same hill has been found what to date is considered the first human settlement of stable and continuous character, although already ascribed to the culture of the Soto de Medinilla of the [[Iron Age|first Iron Age]] (7th century BC). Later, already in the [[Iron Age|second Iron Age]] (from the 4th century BC), it has been found that a new population center developed in the so-called "teso de las catedrales or cerro de San Isidro", this already of [[Castros (Spain)|Castro]] character and that lasted until the definitive Romanization of the city. All these settlements, and therefore the current site of Salamanca, owe their existence to the special geomorphological characteristics of the terrain on which they settled. Thus, the choice of the location of these successive settlements must have had a special influence on the fact that this area had three tesserae -formed by the erosion of the San Francisco and Santo Domingo streams-, their corresponding watercourses and especially the proximity of the Tormes River. These details point to the suitability of this territory for the primitive functions of defense and control of the surrounding territory.

The settlement of the hill of San Isidro must have been a city of great importance between the centuries 4th and 2nd centuries BC, not only for its dimensions, but also for its optimal orographic conditions and defensive protection, since it had a wall and moat. In 220 B.C., [[Hannibal]], in his advance through [[Iberia]], besieged and conquered the ancient city of Helmantica (Salamanca). Thus, [[Plutarch]] says that "Hannibal besieged it and its inhabitants, to avoid further damage, submitted to him offering them three hundred talents of silver and as many hostages, raising the siege, the Helmantiqueses, failed to keep their promises and protected by their women who had hidden their weapons and managed to defeat Hannibal's troops". However, the Carthaginian general ended up seizing them and, according to [[Polybius]], "admired by the bravery of his women, by them he returned to his men the homeland and wealth".

After the [[Second Punic War]], the victorious [[Ancient Roman|Roman]] army began its expansion throughout most of the Iberian Peninsula. Salamanca began an intense period of Romanization as a city annexed to the province of [[Lusitania]]. The Roman Salmantica was restructured, limiting its settlement to the so-called teso de las catedrales, abandoning the site of the hill of San Vicente. Its new configuration kept it as a remarkable city, not only for its particular defensive and accessibility characteristics, but also for being a center of exchange.

[[File:Salamanca (4840607293).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Roman bridge of Salamanca]] is an infrastructure that since the 1st century allows the passage over the Tormes River]]
Three of the cultural elements that have had the greatest influence on the configuration and development of the city of Salamanca come from the Roman period. In the first place, the [[Vía de la Plata|Calzada de la Plata]], considered as its main communication infrastructure, the main axis of city planning and a milestone in the development of its commercial function. Secondly, the [[Roman bridge of Salamanca|Roman bridge]], as an infrastructure that since the 1st century guaranteed the passage over the Tormes river and therefore the access to the city from the south. The Roman bridge still remains today in the northern half, since the other half had to be rebuilt in the 17th century after the [[San Policarpo flood]]. Finally, the so-called Cerca Vieja, primitive wall of the city that surrounded the perimeter of the hill of San Isidro or of the cathedrals on the layout of the previous [[Castros (Spain)|Castro]].

In November 2015, in the course of an emergency excavation carried out in the subsoil of a house located in [[Calle Libreros (Salamanca)|calle Libreros]], several fragments of a male marble statue of a togado character were found, which must have been originally located somewhere in the Roman forum of the city of Salmantica, although it must have been later reused as filler material in the place where it was discovered. The statue is exhibited in the [[Museum of Salamanca]] and is the first, and to date, the only sculptural find from the Roman period that has appeared in the subsoil of the city. Some specialists consider that this finding, put in relation with several Roman inscriptions from the beginning of the Empire found in the ancient Salmantica, allows to defend the hypothetical juridical promotion of the ancient indigenous [[oppidum]] to Roman [[civitas]] during the reign of [[Augustus]].

=== Middle Ages ===
[[File:Salamanca (49520259188).jpg|thumb|[[Walls of Salamanca]]]]
With the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the [[Alans]] settled in [[Lusitania]] and the city became part of this region. Later the [[Visigoths]] conquered the city and annexed it to their territory. There is little information about the development of Salamanca in the Visigothic period, it is only known that in the 4th century the Roman walls were extended with [[keeps]] on the same layout, and that the remains of the previous walls were destroyed practically in their entirety. It is known that in 589 the city was an [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salamanca|episcopal seat]] because it was among the cities that sent bishops to the [[councils of Toledo]].

In 712, with [[Muslim conquest of Spain|the Muslim invasion]] of the Iberian Peninsula, [[Musa ibn Nusayr]] conquered the city. During the [[Early Middle Ages]], the area remained a "no man's land" and most of its population centers were destroyed by the frequent incursions (algaradas) of the Arabs. Salamanca was reduced to an unimportant and almost uninhabited nucleus, although the bridge remained intact, with some settlers in the surrounding area. The successive attempts of the Christian kingdoms to stabilize the area caused many clashes with Muslim expeditions to the north, which caused several skirmishes and battles, such as that of [[Alfonso I of Asturias]] in 754, which ended up destroying what was left of the town.

[[File:Ramiro II de León---1.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ramiro II of León]] undertook a first repopulation in the 10th century.]]
The area remained more or less depopulated until after the important Christian victory, in the [[Battle of Simancas]] of 939, the effective repopulation of the riverside area of the Tormes began. According to the Pelagian wording of the ''Chronicle of Sampiro'', two months after the end of the Islamic attack, [[Ramiro II of León]] ordered the advance of his army towards the banks of the Tormes, where he says that the repopulation began: {{blockquote|''Civitates desertas ibidem populavit; hee sunt: Salamantica, sedes antiqua castrorum, Letesma, Ribas, Balneos, Alphandiga, Penna et alia plurima castella, quod longum est prenotare.''<br>Deserted cities regain population; these are: Salamantica, the ancient seat of the castrum, [[Ledesma, Castile and León|Letesma]], Ribas, Balneos, [[Fresno Alhándiga|Alphandiga]], Penna, and many other towns, we note that it will take too long.|[[Sampiro]], ''[[Chronicle of Sampiro]]'', 11th century.<ref>Ángel Barrios García. ''[http://gredos.usal.es/jspui/bitstream/10366/69668/1/Repoblacion_de_la_zona_meridional_del_Du.pdf Repoblación de la zona meridional del Duero. Phases of occupation, provenances, and spatial distribution of the repopulating groups]''.</ref>}}

Everything seems to indicate that to the pre-existing population was added during this phase the emigration that came fundamentally from comarcas located to the north of the Duero; in the case of Salamanca it is undoubtedly that it is preferably emigrants arriving from the vicinity of [[León, Spain|León]], according to the donation made by [[Ordoño III of León]] in the year 953 to the church of León of all the churches recently constructed in the alfoz of Salamanca.

[[File:AlfonsoVI of Castile.jpg|thumb|upright|King [[Alfonso VI of León]] definitively repopulated the city in 1085, entrusting the direction of this repopulation process to his son-in-law [[Raymond of Burgundy]]]].
After the conquest of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] by [[Alfonso VI of León]] in 1085, the definitive repopulation of the city took place. In 1102, [[Raymond of Burgundy]] went to the city with a large group of settlers of diverse origins, with a composition similar to the new inhabitants of the city of [[Ávila]] -[[Franks]], [[Castile (historical region)|Castilians]], serranos, [[Mozarabs]], [[Toro, Zamora|Toroans]], [[Portuguese people|Portugueses]] and [[Bragança, Portugal|Bragançans]], as well as with the occasional collaboration of Galicians, Jews and Muslims; which are collected in the [[Fuero de Salamanca]],<ref>{{cite book|author=José María Quadrado |title=España: sus monumentos y artes, su naturaleza e historia.

It should not be forgotten that all of medieval Extremadura, territory between the Duero and the Central System, was known in the Arab chronicles as "Country of the Serranos".<ref name="Salamanca y su alfoz"/> Even today there is still a street "calle Serranos" around which this repopulating group was agglutinated.

The new settlers occupied the old walled enclosure and colonized new lands in the surrounding area. The occupation of the city responded to social, ethnic and power criteria. Thus, the social elite was located in the center of the city, a space that coincided with that of the ancient Celtiberian city. The Serranos, linked to political and military power, occupied the western part (house of the royal representative and [[Alcázar]]) and the Franks to the east, together with the Episcopal see and the commercial center around the Azogue Viejo. The Jews will be located next to the Alcázar and the remaining groups of repopulators (Castilians, Portuguese, Jews, Mozarabs, Toroans and Galicians, among others) will be located in the spaces outside the walls.

[[File:Salamanca - Catedral Vieja, exteriores 15 (Torre del Gallo).jpg|thumb|The [[Old cathedral of Salamanca]], built between 1120 and 1236, on the initiative of its first bishop [[Jerome of Périgord]].]]
[[File:2008-07-07 Universidad de Salamanca.jpg|thumb|Current buildings of the [[University of Salamanca]], built between 1401 and 1611. Until the 15th century, classes were held in the cloister of the Old Cathedral, in houses rented from the chapter and in the [[Church of San Benito (Salamanca)|church of San Benito]].]]
The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Salamanca|Diocese of Salamanca]] was restored (the first bishop being [[Jerome of Périgord]]) and the construction of the [[Old Cathedral of Salamanca|Old Cathedral]] was begun, at whose side some schools were founded, which would be the seed of the future university.

In 1218, the monarch [[Alfonso IX of León]] granted privileges that attracted new settlers -among them a large Jewish community-, the city expanded its walled perimeter and granted the [[cathedral schools]] the rank of [[studium generale]] which, in 1254, would become [[University of Salamanca]] by royal decree of [[Alfonso X of Castile]], later ratified by [[Pope Alexander IV]], in 1255:
{{blockquote|To the University of Salamanca's teachers and schoolchildren:<br>We consider it worthy and convenient that those who daily cultivate with lessons the field of study so that they may receive the daisy of science find us favorable and benign in their petitions so that their study may be exercised all the more freely the more they feel protected by apostolic favor. <br>And consequently, in accordance with your request, informed that it sometimes happens that those who have been examined in the Salamancan study and are declared suitable are not allowed to dictate elsewhere if they do not undergo another examination, attending to the request of the illustrious king of Castile and León and yours, we declare that, after some teacher or scholar of Salamanca has taken the relevant examination in some faculty and was declared suitable, he may practice in any other study, without new examination, except in Paris and Bologna. |Letter of Pope Alexander IV to the University of Salamanca. 1255.<br>I. Rodríguez de Lama, ''The pontifical documentation of Pope Alexander IV.'' 1976.}}

The university would eventually achieve great prestige.

On August 12, 1311, the only king of Castile and León that the city has ever produced, [[Alfonso XI of Castile|Alfonso XI]] "the Avenger", was born within [[Walls of Salamanca|Salamanca's walls]]. He acceded to the throne at the age of fourteen and conquered [[Gibraltar]] in command of the militias of the Crown, in which the large presence of Salamancan contingents stood out.

During the 15th century, Salamanca was the scene of great rivalries that affected all areas of urban life, triggering the so-called [[War of the Bands|War of the Bandos]], which pitted two factions led by families of the nobility - the Benitinos and the Tomesinos, so called because they were grouped around the parishes of [[Church of San Benito, Salamanca|San Benito]] and Santo Tomé- that disputed the control of the city and that years later concluded with the signing of a Concord achieved by a brave Augustinian friar who, in time, became the patron saint of the city: [[John of Sahagún|Saint John of Sahagún]].

The 15th century was plagued by social conflict and tensions among the urban elites (a complex development, often oversimplified as an infighting between bandos), with occasional outbursts of grave episodes of violence, conveying a chronic feeling of insecurity.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Las violencias banderizas en la Salamanca medieval.

With the rise of the [[Mesta]], Salamanca gained importance as a center of [[manufacturing]]s draperies and as an exporter of [[wool]].

=== Early modern Age ===
[[File:42 Convento de San Estebán, Salamanca.jpg|thumb|[[Plateresque]] [[Convento de San Esteban, Salamanca|Convento de San Esteban]], built between 1524-1610.]]
Like the rest of the historical nuclei of the Crown that had representation in Cortes, Salamanca joined the [[Revolt of the Comuneros|movement of the Communities of Castile]] (1520) against the new taxes demanded by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] in the [[Cortes of Castile]] and in defense of its textile manufactures against the privileges of the wool exporters. After the defeat of the Comuneros, King Carlos V had the upper part of the towers of the palaces of the Salamancans who joined the revolt removed.

The 16th century was the period of greatest splendor of the city, both in demography and in university life, thanks to the prestige of its professors, with the so-called [[School of Salamanca]]. Then it joined the general decline of the cities of the Crown of Castile in the Meseta Norte (12,000 inhabitants in 1651). Moreover, it was around that time that the [[Church of San Isidoro, Salamanca|Church of San Isidoro]] was built.

The juridical doctrine of the [[School of Salamanca]] represented a change in trajectory from medieval law, which relied extensively on the tradition of [[casuistry]] and on [[Roman law]], to a system that focused more on [[scholasticism]] and [[Thomism]], and which tried to be more explicitly universal. Since Spain had just started colonizing the Americas, the School of Salamanca was interested in the rights on non-Europeans, including rights as a corporeal being (right to life), economic rights (right to own property) and spiritual rights (rights to freedom of thought and rights related to intrinsic human dignity). Due to the institutional connections of Dominicans at the University of Salamanca (especially [[Francisco de Vitoria]]) and Dominican missionaries in the colonies (such as [[Antonio de Montesinos]] and [[Bartolomé de las Casas]]), the School of Salamanca was critical of the Spanish colonists and the laws that permitted their abusive treatment of native peoples. Their work on the idea of ''ius gentium'', or "rights of peoples/nations", was a crucial contribution to the modern development of [[human rights]] and [[international law]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Keenan |first=James F. |title=A History of Catholic Theological Ethics |publisher=[[Paulist Press]] |year=2022 |isbn=9780809155446 |location=New York |pages=214–236 |author-link=James F.

During the 16th century, the city reached its height of splendour (it is estimated that Salamanca had about 24,000 inhabitants and around 1580 6500 students were enrolled each year). During that period, the [[University of Salamanca]] hosted the most important intellectuals of the time;{{citation needed|date=June 2020}} these groups of mostly-[[Dominican Order|Dominican]] scholars were designated the [[School of Salamanca]].

In 1551, the Holy Roman Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] ordered an inquiry to find out if the science of Andreas [[Vesalius]], physician and anatomist, was in line with Catholic doctrine. Vesalius came to Salamanca that same year to appear before the board and was acquitted.

The [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]] of Salamanca was located to the north, next to the walls (more or less the current avenida de Mirat). When, [[Expulsion of Jews from Spain|in 1492, they were expelled]], the neighborhood was walled up and respected by the Salamancans, probably thinking of a possible return, and when it became uninhabited it was filled with rabbits, so it has been known until recently as ''barrio del Conejal''.

[[File:Plaza Mayor de Salamanca in the 18th century, Spain.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Plaza Mayor, Salamanca|Plaza Mayor de Salamanca]], painting of the 18th century.]]
In the 18th century it had an important economic and cultural revival, which led to the completion of the [[New Cathedral of Salamanca]] (whose works had been stopped for almost a century) and the construction of its imposing [[baroque]] [[Plaza Mayor, Salamanca|Plaza Mayor]] in 1729. When the great [[1755 Lisbon earthquake|Lisbon earthquake of 1755]] struck, many of the city's monumental buildings saw the integrity of their fabrics endangered. One of the most revealing images of its effects can still be seen in the [[Church of San Martín de Tours (Salamanca)|Church of San Martín]]: many of the stones must have been in the air for a fraction of a second, enough for the pillars to tilt and the voussoirs of arches and vaults to fall in a place that was not exactly the one they had occupied until that moment, so that in its interior today one can see arched walls and pillars, deformed arches and ribs. However, the city's economic prosperity made it possible to renovate many of the monumental buildings damaged by the earthquake, including the cathedral, which was the most affected of all the Spanish cathedrals. In the cultural aspect, the influence of the [[Enlightenment in Spain|Bourbon Enlightenment]] was also noted in the University in the last third of the century.

=== Modern era ===
[[File:Wellington a Salamanca.jpg|thumb|Wellington at the [[Battle of Salamanca]] (22 July 1812), also known as Battle of the Arapiles, part of the Peninsular War.]]
During the [[Peninsular War]], Salamanca was occupied by the troops of Marshal [[Soult]] in 1809 and remained in [[France|French]] hands until the [[Battle of Arapiles]] (1812),  in which an [[Anglo-Portuguese Army]] led by [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wellington]] decisively defeated the French army of [[Auguste de Marmont|Marmont]]. During the occupation, the French built defenses and, in order to obtain materials, destroyed an important part of the Salamancan buildings, especially in the neighborhood called Caídos (demolished), where the well-known [[Residential college|colegios mayores]] of the University were erected, of which no trace remains. The western quarter of Salamanca was seriously damaged by cannon fire. The battle which raged that day is famous as a defining moment in military history<ref>{{cite web |last1=Phifer |first1=Mike |title=Masterstroke at Salamanca |url=https://warfarehistorynetwork.com/2020/01/29/masterstroke-at-the-battle-of-salamanca/ |website=Warfare History Network |date=29 January 2020 |access-date=7 July 2020}}</ref> and thirteen thousand men were killed or wounded in the space of only a few short hours. A bad moment came when [[Fernando VII of Spain]] closed the Spanish universities. After the reopening, the University of Salamanca was reduced to a provincial university. For the province of Salamanca acted the Salamanca guerrilla and military [[Julián Sánchez García]] "El Charro" in command of the [[Lancers of Castile]] unit.

In 1833 the [[province of Salamanca]] was created, framed in the [[Region of León]],<ref>Royal Decree of November 30, 1833 on the civil division of Spanish territory in the Peninsula and adjacent islands into 49 provinces</ref> thus making the city of Salamanca the capital of that province, becoming home to the [[Diputación Provincial de Salamanca|Diputación de Salamanca]].

In 1873, after the proclamation of the [[First Spanish Republic]], the first serious attempt to federalize Spain was undertaken through the [[Spanish Draft Constitution of 1873|draft Constitution of 1873]]. Barely five days after the presentation of this project, Salamanca suffered a [[Cantonalism|Cantonalista]] uprising which, after four days of success, was put down on July 26, 1873. Subsequently, a military pronouncement took away the First Republic and the regionalizing initiative of the Federal State. During the rest of the 19th century the city experienced a slight recovery when it was named provincial capital and the [[railroad]] linking [[France]] with [[Portugal]], which passed through the Meseta ([[Medina del Campo]] and Salamanca, 1877), was built.

During the devastating [[Spanish Civil War]] (1936–1939) the city quickly went over to the Nationalist side and was temporarily used as the ''de facto'' headquarters for the rebel faction. [[Francisco Franco]] was proclaimed ''Generalissimo'' on 21 September 1936 while at the city. In April 1937, the [[FET y de las JONS]], the single party of the ensuing dictatorship, was created via a [[Unification Decree (Spain, 1937)|Unification Decree]] issued at the city upon the merging of the fascist Falange and the traditionalist carlists. The Nationalists soon moved most of the administrative premises to [[Burgos]], which, being more central, was better suited for this purpose. However, some administrative apparatus, the [[Episcopal Palace of Salamanca|Episcopal Palace]], next to the Old Cathedral was the residence and command center of General [[Francisco Franco]], and the military commands stayed in Salamanca, along with the German and Italian fascist delegations, making it the ''de facto'' Nationalist capital and centre of power during the entire civil war.<ref name=ht01>Hugh Thomas, pág. 550</ref><ref name=ht02>Hugh Thomas, pág. 650</ref> Like much of fervently Catholic and largely rural [[León (historical region)|León]] and [[Old Castile]] regions, Salamanca was a staunch supporter of the Nationalist side and [[Francisco Franco]]'s regime for its long duration.

After the war, the documents seized by the rebel army as they occupied the territory that had defended the Republic were concentrated in Salamanca, creating a large documentary archive on the Spanish Civil War ([[General Archive of the Spanish Civil War]]). The part of this archive, which deals with [[Catalonia]], as well as many valuable papers and documents of individuals and institutions not belonging to that region, was transferred to [[Barcelona]] in the spring of 2006, after great disputes between the [[City Council of Salamanca|Salamanca City Council]] and the Spanish government, and popular demonstrations. The Salamanca City Council, presided by Julián Lanzarote ([[People's Party (Spain)|PP]]), changed the name of the street where the archive is located from "Gibraltar" (a name that paid homage to the Salamanca militias that went with [[Alfonso XI of Castile]] to the conquest of [[Gibraltar]]) to "El Expolio", as a sign of protest after the transfer of the "[[Salamanca Papers]]" to Catalonia.

[[File:PM NE 0554 20.jpg|thumb|Salamancan family posing at the entrance of the [[New Cathedral of Salamanca|new cathedral]] in 1984.]]
In 1940, [[Pope Pius XII]] founded the [[Pontifical University of Salamanca]] as a continuation of the ancient theological studies. In 1988 Salamanca was declared a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Spain|World Heritage City by UNESCO]]. In 1998, by agreement of the Ministers of Culture of the [[European Union]], Salamanca was designated (shared with [[Bruges]]), [[European Capital of Culture]] for the year 2002. The city also aspires to obtain the candidacy for the Universal Exposition of Salamanca in the not too distant future.

Currently the population of the capital of Salamanca, stagnant for about three decades, is around 160,000 inhabitants, although in 2006 it decreased by more than 11,000 people with respect to the year 1994. This is mainly due to the transfer of part of its population to the metropolitan area, and a [[Total fertility rate|very low birth rates]] that occurred from the 1980s onwards (See [[Demographics of Spain]]) leading to an [[Ageing of Europe|aging population]], a phenomenon common to many other Spanish cities, although there is also a high rate of emigration to places like [[Madrid]]. It is significant to note that the province of Salamanca has a high rate of aging population with respect to national data. From June 7–10, 1994, the World Conference on Special Needs Education took place in the capital of Salamanca, with 92 governments and 25 international organizations represented, and concluded with the "Salamanca Declaration of Principles, Policy and Practice for Special Needs Education".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sid.usal.es/idocs/F8/8.4.2-1366/8.4.2-1366.pdf |title=Conferencia Mundial sobre Necesidades Educativas Especiales: Acceso y Calidad.

For its part, the service sector (the buoyant [[cultural tourism]] and the [[University of Salamanca|University]]) is the main source of income for the city. Particularly relevant is the educational activity during the summer, as it has a large influx of students from many countries, who mostly come to learn the [[Spanish language]] and attend various summer courses. On October 14 and 15, 2005, the capital of Salamanca hosted the XV [[Ibero-American Summit]] of Heads of State and Government. The Crown Prince of Japan [[Naruhito]] visited the city on June 13, 2013 on the occasion of the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the Spanish-Japanese exchange. He received from the hands of Mayor [[Alfonso Fernández Mañueco]] the keys to the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.salamanca24horas.com/local/89122-naruhito-recibe-las-llaves-de-la-ciudad-deseando-fortalecer-los-vinculos-con-la-ciudad-3 |title=Naruhito recibe las llaves de la ciudad deseando fortalecer los vínculos con la ciudad |website=Salamanca24horas.com |access-date=April 5, 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=April 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

== Geography ==
Integrated in the comarca of [[Campo Charro]], the capital of Salamanca is located 64 kilometers from [[Zamora, Spain|Zamora]], 109 kilometers from [[Ávila]], 121 kilometers from [[Valladolid]], 123 kilometers from [[Portugal]] and 202 kilometers from [[Cáceres, Spain|Cáceres]].

The relief of the municipality is characterized by the confluence of two geological and environmental units of the southwest of the Castilian-Leonese plateau on the banks of the [[Tormes|Tormes river]]. On the one hand, to the north and east, the Tertiary sedimentary basin, characterized by extensive plains dedicated to dry farming; on the other, the peneplain of the Paleozoic socket to the south and west, where an ecosystem of oak groves and pastures known as [[Campo Charro]] predominates, mostly dedicated to livestock.

The city is located at an altitude of 800 meters above sea level. The altitude of the municipality varies from 911 meters (Los Montalvos), in the southwest, and 763 meters in the last stretch in the municipality of the [[Tormes]] river.

=== Hydrography ===
The municipality of Salamanca is crossed by two surface watercourses: the [[Tormes|Tormes river]] and the Zurguén stream, the latter a tributary of the river on its left bank. The valleys of the two watercourses are characterized by alluvial type materials, considered as permeable. The water table is very high, which sometimes gives rise to waterlogged areas.<ref name="PGOU-SA">[http://urbanismo.aytosalamanca.es/es/visor/index.html PGOU of the municipality of Salamanca (revision-adaptation 2004)]</ref>

The Tormes river articulates the entire [[province of Salamanca|provincial]] territory and has had a decisive influence on the historical development of the city. Its middle course is regulated by the [[Santa Teresa Reservoir]] which also fulfills the function of supplying drinking water and irrigation. Its regulation was also intended to prevent its numerous floods, such as the historic ones that occurred in 1256 and [[San Policarpo flood|1626]], although it did not succeed, in that they have been reiterated subsequently and significantly.

According to it, the name came from the fact that a woman was found dead in the house and no one could explain how the misfortune had happened. The curse weighed on the house and everyone who lived in it would die. This resulted in it remaining empty for a long time and people mysteriously lowered their voices as they passed by.
