'''Andong''' ({{Korean|hangul=안동}}; {{IPA|ko|an.doŋ}}) is a [[Administrative divisions of South Korea|city]] in South Korea, and the capital of [[North Gyeongsang Province]]. It is the largest city in the northern part of the province with a population of 167,821 as of October 2010. The [[Nakdong River]] flows through the city. Andong is a market centre for the surrounding agricultural areas.

Since the 1970s Andong has developed rapidly, although the population has fallen by nearly seventy thousand as people have moved away to [[Seoul]], [[Busan]], [[Daegu]] and other urban centres. In the late 1990s and early 2000s it became a tourism and cultural center.

Andong is known as a centre of culture and [[folk tradition]]s. The surrounding area maintains many types of traditions and the Andong Folk Festival is held in mid October every year. One of the most famous aspects of these cultural festivities are the Andong [[mask]]s.

[[Andong National University]], specialising in education and Korean folklore, has grown rapidly since the 1970s. Other tertiary institutions include [[Andong Science College]] and [[Catholic Sangji College]].

==History==
[[File:Korea-Andong-Dosan Seowon 3015-06.JPG|thumb|left|[[Dosan Seowon]]]]
Around 1 BC, Andong was founded by the [[Jinhan confederacy|Jinhan]] people, and it was known as Gochang. During the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms period]], the area was controlled by the [[Silla]] kingdom. The [[Battle of Gochang]] in 930 was fought here between [[Hubaekje]] forces and the [[Goryeo]] army led by [[Taejo of Goryeo|Wanggeon]], who won control of the city and renamed it Andong.

After the ascent of the [[Joseon dynasty]] to the throne of Korea, Andong became a centre of [[Confucianism]]. The area was extremely conservative for a long time and produced many leading confucian scholars. [[Yi Hwang|Toe-gye Yi Hwang]] (1501–1570), one of the most prominent of all Korean scholars, came from Andong. Yi Hwang retired back to his homeland late in life and started the establishment of the great Confucian academy [[Dosan Seowon]] there, which was finished after his death. During this period Andong and its principal families were influential within Korean political circles, of which the three notable families were the Andong Kim, Andong Jang and Andong [[Gwon|Kwon]] clans.

After the 16th century Andong became less influential until the early 19th century, when a marriage of the local [[Andong Kim|Kim]] family resulted in strong influence on the royal family.

Andong was the site of intense fighting during the [[Korean War]] in the early 1950s, the [[Battle of Andong]]. Although the city was almost destroyed, it was quickly rebuilt. In 1976 the [[Andong Dam]] was built, providing the city with a reliable source of electricity.

In 1999, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth II]] of the United Kingdom celebrated her 73rd [[birthday]] in the city.<ref>{{cite news |date=June 6, 2016 |title=Queen Elizabeth cherishes memory of birthday party in Korea |url=https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2016/06/120_206188.html |work=[[The Korea Times]]|access-date=June 20, 2018}}</ref> There is an exhibit dedicated to this historic visit at Hahoe folk village museum. [[Andong soju]] is made using traditional methods that are centuries old unlike its popular modern counterparts.  It is protected by government regulation to preserve authenticity and commands a steep premium in the marketplace.

==Local specialty foods==
[[Image:Korean.food-Andong.Hansik-Heotjesabab.jpg|thumb|left|[[Heotjesabap]]]]
Andong has famous local foods that originated in the city such as ''[[heotjesabap]]'', ''[[Andong jjimdak]]'', ''[[Andong soju]]'' (a rice wine), ''[[Sikhye|Andong sikhye]]'' (a punch), ''[[Korean noodles|Geonjin guksu]]'' (a noodle dish), and salted [[mackerel]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hansik.org/zh/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId=1075 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402111719/http://www.hansik.org/zh/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId=1075 |archive-date=2012-04-02 }}</ref>

''Heotjesabap''(헛제삿밥) is a variety of ''[[bibimbap]]'', served with [[soy sauce]] (''ganjang'') instead of the ''[[gochujang]]'' (hot pepper paste) that is more commonly used. ''Heotjesa bab'' consists mainly of several types of ''[[namul]]'' (young sprouted vegetables) over white rice. It is also served with grilled fish, shark, and ''[[jeon (food)|jeon]]'' (Korean pancake). The dish originated in Andong. The term, ''Heotjesa bap'' literally means "dishes for fake ''[[jesa]]''" that are ceremonies for [[death anniversary]] and [[ancestor veneration]] held in Korea. The reason it is considered fake is that it is not covered in incense ash, as would happen to any food sacrificed in a jesa ritual.

''Andong jjimdak'' is a variety of ''[[jjim]]'' (a Korean steamed or braised dish), made with chicken, [[cellophane noodles]], and various vegetables [[Marination|marinated]] in a ''ganjang'' ([[Soy sauce#Korean|Korean soy sauce]]) based sauce. The name literally means "steamed chicken of Andong."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.tour2korea.com/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?gotoPage=2&cid=262742 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630063536/http://english.tour2korea.com/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?gotoPage=2&cid=262742 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-06-30 |title=Genuine and Timeless Treasures in Confucian Country |publisher=[[Korea Tourism Organization]] }}</ref><ref name="Doosan">{{cite web|url=http://map.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=812711&contentno=812711 |script-title=ko:안동찜닭 |publisher=[[Doosan Encyclopedia]] |language=ko }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> There are many speculations on the origins of the dish. One is that the it is a specialty food of the inner rich village of Andong during the [[Joseon period]], prepared and eaten for special occasions.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andong.net/news-2007/view.asp?seq=4173 |date=2008-09-04 |script-title=ko:희동이세상 - 안동의 전통음식 |author=Yun Tae-ha (윤태하) |publisher=andong.net |language=ko |access-date=2009-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723013532/http://www.andong.net/news-2007/view.asp?seq=4173 |archive-date=2011-07-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The more likely explanation is that during the 1980s in the ''Dak golmok'' ({{Korean|닭골목|labels=no}}, literally "chicken alley") of the "Andong Old Market," restaurant owners there made a dish including ingredients that regulars demanded, which became the current ''Andong [[Andong jjimdak|jjimdak]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://english.tour2korea.com/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=256762|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120630063537/http://english.tour2korea.com/enu/SI/SI_EN_3_6.jsp?cid=256762|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-06-30|title=Andong, the Home of Confucianism and the Noble Class}}</ref> Restaurateurs in the area claim it was invented by five local old women who had limited chicken supplies and wanted to stretch it out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.korea.net/?p%3D5495 |title=Jungang Hansik: A Culinary Voyage through Korea's Heartland &#124; the Korea Blog |access-date=2011-11-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312134752/http://blog.korea.net/?p=5495 |archive-date=2012-03-12 }}</ref> The most plausible speculation among existing assumptions is that merchants of the ''Dak golmok'' at the market created the dish to keep their position against the rapid expansion of Western fried chicken shops.<ref name="Doosan" />

''Andong Soju'' is a specialty of the region. It is made with natural ingredients, unlike mass-produced brands, it was historically used for medicinal purposes, and was developed during the [[Silla dynasty]]. The traditions of Andong Soju were almost lost during the '60s and '70s due to government legislation, but they were brought back by Cho Ok-hwa, the current skillholder. Andong soju was traditionally made by the wife of a household, and she passed down the secrets to her daughters-in-law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andongsoju.com/english/sub3/sub1.asp |title=Untitled Document |access-date=2011-11-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707142236/http://www.andongsoju.com/english/sub3/sub1.asp |archive-date=2011-07-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hansik.org/zh/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId%3D1064 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402111534/http://www.hansik.org/zh/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId=1064 |archive-date=2012-04-02 }}</ref>

''[[Mackerel]]'' is another popular local delicacy. Caught downstream where the [[Nakdong River]] meets the sea, in ancient times the fish would spoil before being brought further inland. Using special salting techniques, Andong was the furthest inland the fish could be brought, so aristocrats would travel to Andong specially for the salted fish.<ref name="hansik.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.hansik.org/en/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId%3D1062 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-09 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402111542/http://www.hansik.org/en/restaurant/recommendRestaurantView.do?fboardId=1062 |archive-date=2012-04-02 }}</ref>

''[[Sikhye]]'' is a fermented rice punch served across Korea. The Andong variety, however, is particularly spicy, made with powdered red pepper, ginger, and radish. Sikhye contains [[lactobacillus]], a benign strain of bacteria found in the gastrointestinal tract, and often used as a digestive aid in dishes including [[kimchi]], yogurt, and sauerkraut, among others.<ref name="hansik.org"/>
