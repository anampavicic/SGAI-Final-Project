'''Lleida''' ({{IPA|ca|ˈʎejðə|lang|Ca-no-Lleida.ogg}}, {{IPA|ca|ˈʎejðɛ|local}}; {{langx|es|'''Lérida'''}} {{IPA|es|ˈleɾiða||Pronunciation of Lleida in Spanish.ogg}}; ''[[#Name|see below]]'') is a city in the west of [[Catalonia]], Spain. It is the capital and largest town in [[Segrià|Segrià county]], the [[Ponent|Ponent region]] and the [[province of Lleida]]. Geographically, it is located in the [[Catalan Central Depression]]. It had 140,797 inhabitants {{as of|2022|lc=on}}.

Lleida is one of the oldest towns in Catalonia, with recorded settlements dating back to the [[Bronze Age]] period. Until the [[Hispania|Roman conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]], the area served as a settlement for an [[Iberian people]], the [[Ilergetes]]. The town became a municipality, named Ilerda, under the reign of [[Augustus]]. It was ruled by Muslims from the 8th century until [[Siege of Lleida (1149)|reconquered in 1149]]. In 1297, the [[University of Lleida]] was founded, becoming the third oldest in the whole of Spain. During the following centuries, the town was damaged by several wars such as the [[Reapers' War]] in the 17th century and the [[Spanish Civil War]] in the 20th century. Since then, the city has been in constant urban, commercial and demographic growth.

==Name==
Although the usual [[Spanish language|Spanish]] form of the town's name is {{lang|es|Lérida}}, pronounced {{IPA|es|ˈleɾiða||Pronunciation of Lleida in Spanish.ogg}}, the associations of that name with enforced [[Castilianization]] under the [[Francoist Spain|Francoist regime]] have led to the [[Catalan language|Catalan]] form {{lang|ca|Lleida}} being used for official purposes even in Spanish.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sàez |first=Anna |date=2024-01-21 |title=El lleidatanisme a debat - 13 des 2015 |url=http://www.elpuntavui.cat/cultura/article/19-cultura/923137-el-lleidatanisme-a-debat.html |access-date=2024-01-21 |website=El Punt Avui |language=ca}}</ref> The local pronunciation of the name is {{IPA|ca|ˈʎejðɛ|}},<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dcvb.iec.cat/results.asp?word=Lleida|title=Lleida|publisher=Diccionari català-valencià-balear (DCVB)|language=ca}}</ref> while the standard pronunciation is {{IPA|ca|ˈʎejðə||Ca-no-Lleida.ogg}}.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Lleida}}
[[File:PM 106756 E Lleida.jpg|thumb|left|[[Indibilis and Mandonius|Indíbilis, king of the Ilergetes (left) and Mandonius, king of the Ausetani (right)]]]]

In ancient times the city, named ''Iltrida'' and ''Ilerda'', was the chief city of the [[Ilergetes]], an [[Iberians|Iberian]] tribe. [[Indibilis and Mandonius|Indíbil, king of the Ilergetes, and Mandoni, king of the Ausetanes]], defended it against the Carthaginian and Roman invasions.

Under the Romans the city was incorporated into the Roman province of [[Hispania Tarraconensis]], and was a place of considerable importance, historically as well as geographically. It stood upon an eminence, on the right (west) bank of the river Sicoris (the modern [[Segre River|Segre]]), the principal tributary of the [[Ebre]], and some distance above its confluence with the Cinga (modern [[Cinca River (Spain)|Cinca]]); thus commanding the country between those rivers, as well as the great road from Tarraco (modern [[Tarragona]]), the provincial capital, to the northwest of Spain, which here crossed the Sicoris.<ref>''[[Antonine Itinerary]]'' pp. 391, 452.</ref>

Its situation<ref>To quote [[Julius Caesar]], "''propter ipsius loci opportunitatem''", ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' i. 38.</ref> induced the legates of [[Pompey]] in Spain to make it the key of their defense against Caesar, in the first year of the [[Caesar's civil war|Civil War]] (49 BC). [[Lucius Afranius (consul)|Afranius]] and [[Marcus Petreius]] threw themselves into the place with five legions; and their siege by Caesar himself ([[Battle of Ilerda]]), as narrated in his own words, forms one of the most interesting passages of military history. Caesar's skill as a general, in a contest where the formation of the district and a series of natural events seemed very favorable to his enemies, ultimately gained him victory. It was ended by the capitulation of Afranius and Petreius.<ref>[[Julius Caesar]] ''[[Commentarii de Bello Civili]]'' i. 38, ''et seq.''; [[Florus]] iv. 12; [[Appian]], ''B.C.'' ii. 42; [[Velleius Paterculus]] ii. 42; [[Suetonius]] ''Caes.'' 34; [[Lucan (poet)|Lucan]], ''Pharsal.'' iv. 11, 144.</ref> In consequence of the battle, the [[Latin phrase]] ''Ilerdam videas'' is said to have been used by people who wanted to cast bad luck on someone else.

Under the [[Roman Empire]] Ilerda was a prosperous city and a ''[[municipium]]''. It minted its own coins. It had a fine stone bridge over the Sicoris, which was so sturdy that its foundations support a bridge to this day. In the time of [[Ausonius]] the city had fallen into decay but it rose again into importance in the Middle Ages.<ref>[[Strabo]] iii. p. 161; Horat. ''Epist.'' i. 20. 13; coins, ''ap.'' [[Enrique Florez|Florez]], ''Med.'' ii. pp. 451, 646, iii. p. 73; Théodore Edme Mionnet, vol. i. p. 44, Suppl. vol. i. p. 89; Sestini, pp. 161, 166; [[Eckhel]], vol. i. p. 51.</ref>

It was part of [[Visigoths|Visigothic]] and [[Al-Andalus|Muslim Hispania]] until it was [[Siege of Lleida (1149)|conquered from the Moors]] by Count [[Ramon Berenguer IV, Count of Barcelona|Ramon Berenguer IV]] of [[County of Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 1149.

It used to be the seat of a [[University of Lleida|major university]], the oldest in the [[Crown of Aragon]], until 1717, when it was moved by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip V]] to the nearby town of [[Cervera]]. The [[University of Lleida]] is nowadays active again since 1991.

During the [[Reapers' War]] Lleida was occupied by the French and rebel forces. In 1644 the city was conquered by the Spanish under [[Felipe da Silva]].

Lleida served as a key defence point for [[Barcelona]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]] and fell to the [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Insurgents]], whose air forces bombed it extensively in 1937 and 1938. The 2 November 1937 [[Legion Condor]] attacks against Lleida became especially infamous since they were aimed to the school known as ''[[Liceu Escolar de Lleida]]''. 48 children and several teachers died in it that day, 300 people were killed in the 2 November bombings altogether and the town would be bombed and besieged again in 1938, when it was conquered by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s forces.<ref>[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0037646] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416235739/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0037646|date=April 16, 2015}}</ref>

After some decades without any kind of population growth it experienced a massive influx of [[Andalusian people|Andalusians]], who helped the town undergo a relative demographic growth. Nowadays it is home to immigrants of 146 different nationalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www6.gencat.net/llengcat/noves/hm05primavera-estiu/sola1_3.htm |title=''Noves sl. primavera-estiu 2005.

=== Jewish History ===
[[File:The Jewish ritual bath of Llerida, Spain.jpg|thumb|The mikveh, or Jewish ritual bath, in Lleida.]]
The ''[[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|Juderia]]'', or Jewish quarter in Lleida dates back to the 11th century. The Jewish quarter in Lleida was also referred to as La Cuirassa. This name distinction is unique compared to other Jewish communities in Spain, and historians believe that the origin of the term is linked to the former Jewish quarter that existed in the times of the Moors, which was connected to the "coiraça", a protrusion of the city wall. The Jews established their quarter next to this wall, leading to the name "La Cuirassa."<ref>{{cite web |title=La Cuirassa |url=https://demoturisme.paeria.cat/arxius/la-cuirassa-2019-ang |website=Turisme de Lleida |access-date=24 June 2024}}</ref> A street named "Judería", which still exists in today's Lleida dates back to the time where the Jewish quarter was still active. The Jewish quarter was located in the fortified area of Lleida; in this area, a ring with the name "Goig" carved in [[Hebrew]] was found in 1870.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lérida |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/l-x00e9-rida# |website=Jewish Virtual Library |access-date=24 June 2024}}</ref>
A Jewish ritual bath, or [[mikveh]] dating to the 9th century, one of the oldest in Europe, was found in Lleida.<ref>{{cite web |title=JEWISH LLEIDA 1/2 DAY |url=https://www.tondavid.cat/portfolio-items/jewish-lleida-1-2-day/ |website=Ton-David Jover |access-date=24 June 2024}}</ref>

==Transport==
===Railway===
[[Image:Lleida, estació de tren, d'Adolf Florensa (1927) (14847092915).jpg|thumb|[[Lleida-Pirineus railway station]]]]
Lleida is served by [[Renfe]]'s [[Madrid-Barcelona high-speed rail line]], serving [[Barcelona]], [[Zaragoza]], [[Calatayud]], [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]], and [[Madrid]]. Lleida has a [[Lleida-Alguaire Airport|new airport]] opened in January 2010, and a minor airfield located in [[Alfès]]. Also, the town is the western terminus of the [[Eix Transversal]] Lleida-[[Girona]], and a railway covering the same distance (''Eix Transversal Ferroviari'') is currently under planning.

Lleida's only passenger railway station is [[Lleida Pirineus railway station|Lleida Pirineus]]. It is served by both [[Renfe]] and [[Ferrocarrils de la Generalitat de Catalunya]] train lines. In the future a [[Rodalies Lleida]] commuter network will connect the town with its adjacent area and the main towns of its province, improving the existing network with more train frequency and newly built infrastructure. A second railway station is [[Pla de la Vilanoveta railway station|Pla de la Vilanoveta]] in an industrial area, and only used by freight trains. A future railway museum will be located in its facilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bondia.cat/component/content/article/63-societat/9612-el-museu-del-ferrocarril-de-lleida-subicara-a-lestacio-de-la-vilanoveta |title=El Museu del Ferrocarril de Lleida s'ubicarà a l'estació de la Vilanoveta |publisher=Bondia.cat |access-date=2011-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706214539/http://www.bondia.cat/component/content/article/63-societat/9612-el-museu-del-ferrocarril-de-lleida-subicara-a-lestacio-de-la-vilanoveta |archive-date=2011-07-06 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since 2008 the bulk of public transport of [[Ponent|Lleida's surrounding area]], mainly buses operated by several companies, is managed by [[Autoritat Territorial de la Mobilitat de l'Àrea de Lleida]].

In addition to these, there's a tourist bus and a regular night service to nearby clubs.

===Lleida-Pirineus airport===
[[Image:Aeroport de Lleida-Alguaire retouched.jpg|thumb|''Lleida-Alguaire'' airport]]
Lleida has depended long time on nearby airports and had no local air transit. The [[Lleida–Alguaire Airport|Lleida-Alguaire airport]] opened in 2010.

===Future and planned services===
A [[tram]]-[[train]] system is pending approval. Using an existing but outdated passenger line, it would link [[Balaguer]] and Lleida, crossing both towns in a much needed move towards better public transportation, both inner-city and between localities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.transportpublic.org/images/pdf/20100118-balaguer1.pdf |title=Data |website=www.transportpublic.org |format=PDF}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccoo.cat/lleida/aspnet/noticia.aspx?id=118457 |title=CCOO de les Terres de Lleida. – El tren-tram, transport de futur per a l'àrea de Lleida – www.ccoo.cat/lleida |publisher=Ccoo.cat |date=2010-01-19 |access-date=2011-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elperiodic.com/palicante/noticias/29639_responsables-ferrocarrils-catalua-visitan-tram-para-llevar-modelo-lleida-manresa.html |title=Responsables de Ferrocarrils de Cataluña visitan el TRAM para llevar el modelo a Lleida y Manresa |publisher=elperiodic.com |date=2009-02-21 |access-date=2011-03-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710184952/http://www.elperiodic.com/palicante/noticias/29639_responsables-ferrocarrils-catalua-visitan-tram-para-llevar-modelo-lleida-manresa.html |archive-date=2011-07-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Languages==

Lleida was the [[Capital of Catalan Culture]] in 2007.

===Theatre and music venues===
[[Auditori Enric Granados|Enric Granados Auditorium]] is the city's concert hall and main music institution and conservatory. It is named after the composer [[Enric Granados]], who was born in the city. [[CaixaForum Lleida]] (formerly known as ''Centre Cultural de la Fundació La Caixa'') includes a concert hall. [[Teatre Municipal de l'Escorxador]] is the town's main theatre; it includes a concert venue, [[Cafè del Teatre]]. A theatre and congress centre, [[La Llotja de Lleida]], opened in 2010.

===Music festivals===
There are two important music festivals in Lleida; MÚSIQUES DISPERSES Folk Festival in March,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.musiquesdisperses.com|title=MUD. Festival Músiques Disperses|website=www.musiquesdisperses.com}}</ref> and the jazz festival JAZZ TARDOR in November. Concerts are also a regular fixture of the two local feasts, Sant Anastasi in May, and Sant Miquel in September.

===Film===
[[CaixaForum Lleida]] is the usual venue for film-related events and screenings. A [[Latin-American]] film festival is held yearly in the town ([[Lleida Latin-American Film Festival|''Mostra de Cinema Llatinoamericà de Lleida'']]), and an animation film festival called ''[[Animac]]'' is held every May.

===Art and museums===
The [[Lleida Museum]] opened in 2008 and displays historical artefacts and works of art from various periods. The [[Institut d'Estudis Ilerdencs]], a historically relevant building, exhibits both ancient and contemporary art. The [[Centre d'Art La Panera]] is a contemporary art institution. The [[Museu d'Art Jaume Morera]] displays art from the 20th and 21st centuries (as well as artwork by its namesake).

The city has a number of small municipal galleries, such as the Sala Municipal d'Exposicions de Sant Joan and the Sala Manel Garcia Sarramona. There are also several institutions dedicated to local artists, such as the Sala Leandre Cristòfol, containing artwork by the sculptor and painter [[Leandre Cristòfol]] (1908–1998); and the Sala Coma Estadella, dedicated to the sculptor and painter [[Albert Coma Estadella]] (1933–1991).

Private art galleries include the Espai Cavallers. The private foundation CaixaForum Lleida and the [[Public Library of Lleida]] also offer regular exhibits. The now defunct [[Petite Galerie (Lleida)|Petite Galerie]] was an innovative and influential gallery in the 1970s.

The [[Escola Municipal de Belles Arts, Lleida|Escola Municipal de Belles Arts]] provides higher education in the arts.

===Traditional culture===
[[File:Els Gegants de Lleida.JPG|thumb|The Giants of Lleida in front of the Paeria]]
Traditional celebrations include the main annual town festivity: ''Festa Major''; ''Fira de Sant Miquel'' and ''[[L’Aplec del Caragol]]'' ([[escargot]]-eating festival, the biggest in the world of this sort, held at the Camps Elisis since 1980).

The latter is a gastronomical festivity focused on escargot cooking and is celebrated yearly at the end of May. "L'Aplec" gathers thousands of people around the table to taste the most traditional dishes from Lleida.

Due to its strong popularity, it was declared a traditional festivity of national interest in 2002 by the Generalitat of Catalonia and two years later it was also declared as such by the Spanish Government.

The main traditional celebrations in Lleida are chaired by the twelve emblematic "Gegants de la Paeria" (Giants of the Town Hall), the two oldest made in 1840.

===Nightlife===
Lleida has a bar and clubbing area, informally known as ''Els Vins''. The oldest part of the quarter, known as ''Els Vins Vells'', has been largely replaced by ''Els Vins Nous'', an architecturally newer and more upscale area. Most big clubs in Lleida are located outside the town and are not easily accessible without a car,{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} though on Saturday nights there is a bus.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atmlleida.cat/en/busnit|title=BusNit|website=www.atmlleida.cat|access-date=2020-01-17}}</ref>
