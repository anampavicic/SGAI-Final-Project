'''Torreón''' ({{IPA|es|toreˈon|-|ES-pe - Torreón.ogg}}) is a city and seat of [[Torreón Municipality]] in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Coahuila]]. As of 2021, the city's population was 735,340. The metropolitan population as of 2015 was 1,497,734,<ref name="inegi.org.mx"/> making it the [[List of metropolitan areas of Mexico|ninth-biggest metropolitan area in the country]] and the largest metropolitan area in the [[States of Mexico|state]] of [[Coahuila]], as well as one of Mexico's most important economic and industrial centers. The cities of Torreón; Gómez Palacio, Durango; Lerdo, Durango; Matamoros; Francisco I. Madero; San Pedro; Bermejillo, Durango; and Tlahualilo, Durango form the area of '''La Laguna''' or the [[Comarca Lagunera]], a basin within the [[Chihuahuan Desert]].

The area was originally a center for ranching. With irrigation, the city became an important center for farming and the processing of cotton. In the middle of the 20th century, it became an industrial city. The cities (i.e. the metropolitan area) have industries in textiles, clothing and metals processing. Some important industries and companies have business here, like [[Peñoles]], [[Deere & Company|Motores John Deere]], [[Grupo Lala]], Yura Corporation, as well as stores like [[Soriana]], [[Cimaco]], and Extra. There are also several shopping malls in the city, including Galerias Laguna, Almanara, Plaza Cuatro Caminos, and InterMall.

Torreón is served by [[Francisco Sarabia International Airport]], an airport with flights to several cities in [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]].

==History==
According to archaeological findings, the area of Torreón was populated around the 10th millennium BC.

[[File:Único y último torreón en Torreón, capital del estado de Coahuila..jpg|thumb|One of the few remaining towers (Torreones) in the city.]]

The first Spanish mission arrived in 1566, led by Fr. Pedro Espinareda. However, the city developed only in the independent Mexican era, around a ''Torreón'' ("Big Tower") built to monitor Río Nazas's floods, in conjunction with the creation of a railroad connecting to the US border city of [[El Paso]], which gave an economic boom to the city and therefore a population boom as well. The population grew from 200 in 1892 to 34,000 in 1910. Torreón received city status in 1907.

During the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1920), the city was taken more than once; the most prominent character ever to take the city was the revolutionary general [[Pancho Villa]]. It was also the location of the 1911 [[Torreón massacre]], where 303 Chinese immigrants were killed by the revolutionaries over a ten-hour period.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Jacques |first=Leo M. Dambourges |date=Autumn 1974 |title=The Chinese Massacre in Torreon (Coahuila) in 1911 |jstor=40168453 |journal=[[Arizona and the West]] |publisher=[[University of Arizona Press]] |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=233–246 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/16/mexico-chinese-massacre-centenary-torreon Mexico faces up to uneasy anniversary of Chinese massacre], theguardian.com, 16 May 2021</ref> During the revolution, Torreón was also the site of an important convention that led to a deal between the rebellious armies. The city is {{convert|56|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} southwest of historic [[San Pedro de las Colonias]], where some of the Mexican Revolution battles occurred.

After the Mexican Revolution, the city continued to develop economically; during the first years of the 20th century, the primary industry of the city was farming, although other industries later formed or were established in the area.

On September 15, 2007, Torreón celebrated its first 100 years as a chartered city. It held a series of cultural events from September 15, 2006, to September 15, 2007, culminating on the day that the city turned 100 years old.

== Geography ==

Torreón is near the southwest border of the state of Coahuila, within the [[Comarca Lagunera|Laguna]] region of the state. The border is delineated by the [[Río Nazas|Nazas River]] that separates it from Gómez Palacio, Durango. The municipality covers {{convert|1947.7|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}}, including much of the rural area south of the city. The city's elevation is {{convert|1120|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}}, which is low for the Mexican interior. The terrain where the urban area is spread is generally flat, with somewhat prominent relief formations (up to {{convert|1600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} south and southwest of the city, thus visible at well-nigh any given point in the city. Higher mountains, over {{convert|3000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, are on the southern, mostly uninhabited section of the Municipality, the most prominent being El Picacho.
===Climate===
The city features a [[desert]] climate (in the [[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWh''). Rainfall is scarce but more prominent in the summer, whilst temperatures are very hot by day and cool at night, although the [[urban heat island]] effect causes temperatures on summer nights to be considerably warmer than nearby areas. Flora and fauna are those common to [[semidesert]] habitats.
