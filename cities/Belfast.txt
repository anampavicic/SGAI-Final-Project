It is the second-largest city on the island of [[Ireland]] (after [[Dublin]]), with an estimated population of {{UK subdivision population|GSS=N09000003}} in {{UK subdivision statistics year}},<ref name="popstats" /> and a [[Belfast metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] population of 671,559.<ref name=":17">{{Cite web |title=Belfast Population 2024 |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/belfast-population |access-date=2024-01-22 |website=worldpopulationreview.com}}</ref>

First chartered as an [[English people|English]] settlement in 1613, the town's early growth was driven by an influx of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Presbyterian Church in Ireland|Presbyterians]]. Their descendants' disaffection with [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]'s [[Protestant Ascendancy|Anglican establishment]] contributed to the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion of 1798]], and to the [[Acts of Union 1800|union]] with [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] in 1800 — later regarded as a key to the town's industrial transformation. When granted [[City status in the United Kingdom#Northern Ireland|city status]] in 1888, Belfast was the world's largest centre of [[linen]] manufacture, and by the 1900s her shipyards were building up to a quarter of total [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] tonnage.

[[Sectarianism|Sectarian]] tensions accompanied the growth of an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[Catholic Church in Ireland|Catholic]] population drawn by mill and factory employment from western districts. Heightened by division over Ireland's future in the [[United Kingdom]], these twice erupted in periods of sustained violence: [[The Troubles in Ulster (1920–1922)|in 1920–22]], as Belfast emerged as the capital of the [[Partition of Ireland|six northeast counties]] retaining the British connection, and over [[The Troubles|three decades from the late 1960s]] during which the [[British Army]] was continually deployed on the streets. A legacy of conflict is the [[Peace lines|barrier-reinforced separation]] of [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] and Catholic [[Working class|working-class]] districts.

Since the [[1998 Northern Ireland Good Friday Agreement referendum|1998 Belfast Agreement]], the electoral balance in the once [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]]-controlled city has shifted, albeit with no overall majority, in favour of [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]]. At the same time, new immigrants are adding to the growing number of residents unwilling to identify with either of the two communal traditions.

Belfast has seen significant [[Tertiary sector of the economy|services sector]] growth, with important contributions from financial technology ([[fintech]]), from tourism and, with facilities in the redeveloped [[Belfast Harbour|Harbour Estate]], from film. It retains a port with commercial and industrial docks, including a reduced [[Harland & Wolff]] shipyard and aerospace and defence contractors. [[Windsor Framework|Post Brexit]], Belfast and Northern Ireland remain, uniquely, within both the British domestic and [[European single market|European Single]] trading areas for goods.

The city is served by two airports: [[George Best Belfast City Airport]] on the Lough shore and [[Belfast International Airport]] {{convert|15|mi|0|abbr=off}} west of the city. It supports two universities: on the north-side of the city centre, [[Ulster University]], and on the southside the longer established [[Queen's University Belfast|Queens University.]] Since 2021, Belfast has been a [[UNESCO]] designated [[City of Music (UNESCO)|City of Music]].

Together with French [[Huguenots]], the Scots introduced the production of [[linen]], a [[flax]]-spinning industry that in the 18th century carried Belfast trade to the Americas.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bardon|first=Jonathon Bardon|title=The Plantation of Ulster|publisher=Gill & Macmillan|year=2011|isbn=978-0-7171-4738-0|location=Dublin|pages=322}}</ref> Fortunes were made carrying rough linen clothing and salted provisions to the [[slave plantation]]s of the [[West Indies]]; sugar and rum to [[Baltimore]] and [[New York City|New York]]; and for the return to Belfast [[flax]]seed and [[tobacco]] from [[Thirteen Colonies|the colonies]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=McMaster |first=Richard |date=2011 |title=Scotch-Irish Merchants in Colonial America: The Flaxseed Trade and Emigration from Ireland, 1718–1755 |url=http://www.booksireland.org.uk/store/all-departments/scotch-irish-merchants-in-colonial-america-ebook |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210522182339/http://www.booksireland.org.uk/store/all-departments/scotch-irish-merchants-in-colonial-america-ebook |archive-date=22 May 2021 |access-date=2021-05-22 |website=Ulster Historical Foundation}}</ref> From the 1760s, profits from the trade financed improvements in the town's commercial infrastructure, including the [[Lagan Canal]], new docks and quays, and the construction of the White Linen Hall which together attracted to Belfast the linen trade that had formerly gone through [[Dublin]].

Belfast is at the mouth of the River Lagan at the head of Belfast Lough open through the [[North Channel (Great Britain and Ireland)|North Channel]] to the [[Irish Sea]] and to the [[North Atlantic]]. In the course of the 19th century, the location's estuarine features were re-engineered.

It remains the case that much of the city centre is built on an estuarine bed of "sleech": silt, peat, mud and—a source the city's ubiquitous red brick— soft clay, that presents a challenge for high-rise construction.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hancock |first=Michaila |date=2019 |title=Ground improvement: Slaying the sleech |url=https://www.geplus.co.uk/features/ground-improvement-slaying-sleech-20-11-2019/ |access-date=2024-01-28 |website=Ground Engineering}}</ref> (It was this soft foundation that persuaded [[St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast|St Anne's Cathedral]] to abandon plans for a bell tower and, in 2007, to substitute a lightweight steel spire).<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Spire of Hope |url=https://www.belfastcathedral.org/tourism/the-spire-of-hope |access-date=2024-01-28 |website=Belfast Cathedral}}</ref> The city centre is also subject to tidal flood risk.

The city is overlooked on the [[County Antrim]] side (to the north and northwest) by a precipitous [[basalt]] [[escarpment]]—the near continuous line of [[Divis]] Mountain (478&nbsp;m), [[Black Mountain (Belfast)|Black Mountain]] (389&nbsp;m) and [[Cavehill]] (368&nbsp;m)—whose "heathery slopes and hanging fields are visible from almost any part of the city".<ref name=":20" />{{rp|13}} From [[County Down]] side (on the south and south east) it is flanked by the lower-lying [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh]] and [[Holywood, County Down|Hollywood]] hills.

=== North Belfast and Shankill ===
From 1820, Belfast began to spread rapidly beyond its 18th century limits. To the north, it stretched out along roads which drew into the town migrants from Scots-settled hinterland of [[County Antrim]].<ref name=":4" /> Largely Presbyterian, they enveloped a number of Catholic-occupied "[[Tied cottage|mill-row]]" clusters: [[New Lodge, Belfast|New Lodge]], [[Ardoyne]] and "the Marrowbone".<ref>{{Cite web |last=P&P |date=2021-11-13 |title=Ardoyne – The Story of a Village |url=https://www.belfastentries.com/places/ardoyne/ |access-date=2024-02-07 |website=Belfast Entries}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Liggett |first=Michael |title=District Called the Bone: Brief History of the 'Marrowbone' Area of Belfast |publisher=Glenravel Publications |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-9519261-2-3 |location=Belfast}}</ref> Together with areas of more substantial housing in the [[Oldpark (District Electoral Area)|Oldpark district]], these are wedged between Protestant working-class housing stretching from [[Shore Road, Belfast|Tiger's Bay]] out the Shore Road on one side, and up the [[Shankill Road|Shankill]] (the original Antrim Road) on the other.<ref>{{Cite web |title=City of Belfast – Industry, Tourism, Religious Segregation, Map |url=https://www.wesleyjohnston.com/users/ireland/geography/belfast.html |access-date=2024-02-07 |website=wesleyjohnston.com}}</ref>

The Greater Shankill area, including [[Crumlin Road|Crumlin]] and [[Court (District Electoral Area)|Woodvale]], is over the line from the [[Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast North]] parliamentary/assembly constituency, but is physically separated from the rest of [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]] by an extensive series of separation barriers<ref>{{Citation |last=Naked Ireland |title=The West Belfast Peace Wall between the Nationalist Falls/Springfield road and the Loyalist Shankill |date=2022 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3xls7PLnAM |access-date=2024-02-10}}</ref>—[[Peace lines|peace walls]]—owned (together with five daytime gates into the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls area]]) by the [[Department of Justice (Northern Ireland)|Department of Justice]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=FactCheckNI |date=2016-12-16 |title=Who opens and closes interface gates? |url=https://factcheckni.org/topics/peace/who-opens-and-closes-interface-gates/ |access-date=2024-02-07 |website=FactCheckNI}}</ref> These include Cupar Way where tourists are informed that, at 45 feet, the barrier is "three times higher than the [[Berlin Wall]] and has been in place for twice as long".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-07-27 |title=What is a peace wall?

With other working-class districts, Shankill suffered from the "collapse of old industrial Belfast".<ref name=":03">{{Cite web |date=2009 |title=The Rape and Plunder of the Shankill Revisited |url=https://archive.northernvisions.org/specialcollections/ogfeatures/the-rape-and-plunder-of-the-shankill-revisited/ |access-date=2024-02-08 |website=Northern Visions}}</ref> But it was also greatly affected from the 1960s by the city's most ambitious programme of "slum clearance". Red-brick, "two up, two down" terraced streets, typical of 19th century working-class housing, were replaced with flats, maisonettes, and car parks but few facilities. In a period of twenty years, due largely to redevelopment, 50,000 residents left the area leaving an aging population of 26,000<ref>{{Cite web |last=Redpath |first=Jackie |date=1995 |title=CAIN: Templegrove: Fifth Public Discussion – The Shankill and the Falls: The Minority Experiences |url=https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/segregat/temple/discus5.htm |access-date=2024-02-08 |website=cain.ulster.ac.uk}}</ref><ref name=":03" /> and more than 100 acres of wasteland.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fitzmaurice |first=Maurice |date=2021-06-29 |title=Project highlights over 100 acres of wasteground in Greater Shankill |url=https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/shankill-road-project-highlights-acres-20929613 |access-date=2024-02-08 |website=Belfast Live}}</ref>

Meanwhile, [[Belfast Urban Motorway|road schemes]], including the terminus of the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1 motorway]] and the [[Westlink (road)|Westlink]], demolished a mixed dockland community, [[Sailortown (Belfast)|Sailortown]] and severed the streets linking the Shankill area and the rest of both north and west Belfast to the city centre.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Martire |first=Agustina |date=2017 |title=Walking the Streets: No More Motorways for Belfast |url=https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/162507950/F17_57502_Final_OA.pdf |url-status=live |journal=Spaces and Flows |volume=8 |issue=3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200610231419/https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/162507950/F17_57502_Final_OA.pdf |archive-date=10 June 2020 |access-date=25 May 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Johnston |first=Wesley |url= |title=The Belfast Urban Motorway: Engineering, Ambition and Social Conflict |date=2014 |publisher=Colourpoint Books |isbn=978-1-78073-047-9}}</ref>

New "green field" housing estates were built on the outer edges of the city. The onset of the Troubles overwhelmed attempts to promote these as "mixed" neighbourhoods so that the largest of these developments on the city's northern edge, [[Rathcoole (Newtownabbey)|Rathcoole]] rapidly solidified as a [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] community.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CAIN: Issues: Housing – Intimidation in Housing by John Darby (1974) – Chapter 6 |url=https://cain.ulster.ac.uk/issues/housing/docs/nicrc6.htm |access-date=2024-02-08 |website=cain.ulster.ac.uk}}</ref> In 2004, it was estimated that 98% of public housing in Belfast was divided along religious lines.<ref name="SelfImposed">"[https://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,1191027,00.html Self-imposed Apartheid]", by [[Mary O'Hara]], published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on Wednesday 14 April 2004.

Among the principal landmarks of north Belfast are the [[HM Prison Belfast|Crumlin Road Gaol]] (1845) now a major visitor attraction, [[Belfast Royal Academy]] (1785) - the oldest school in the city, [[St Malachy's College]] (1833), [[Holy Cross Church, Ardoyne]] (1902), [https://www.belfastcity.gov.uk/things-to-do/parks-and-open-spaces/a-z-parks/waterworks Waterworks Park] (1889), and [[Belfast Zoo]] (1934).

=== West Belfast ===
In the mid-19th century rural poverty and famine drove large numbers of Catholic tenant farmers, landless labourers and their families toward Belfast. Their route brought them down the [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]] and into what are now remnants of an older Catholic enclave around [[St Mary's Church, Belfast|St Mary's Church]], the town's first Catholic chapel (opened in 1784 with Presbyterian subscriptions),<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-02-24 |title=First Ecumenical Ash Wednesday Service to take place in Belfast |url=https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2020/02/24/news/first-ecumenical-ash-wednesday-service-to-take-place-in-belfast-1849878/ |access-date=2024-02-10 |website=The Irish News}}</ref> and [[Smithfield Market and Library Quarter, Belfast|Smithfield Market]].<ref name=":4" /> Eventually, an entire west side of the city, stretching up the Falls Road, along the [[Springfield Road]] (encompassing the new housing estates built 1950s and 60s: Highfield, New Barnsley, Ballymurphy, Whiterock and Turf Lodge) and out past [[Andersonstown]] on the Stewartstown Road toward [[Poleglass]], became near-exclusively Catholic and, in political terms, nationalist.

Reflecting the nature of available employment as mill workers, domestics and shop assistants, the population, initially, was disproportionately female. Further opportunities for women on the Falls Road arose through developments in education and public health. In 1900, the [[Dominican Order]] opened [[St Mary's University College, Belfast|St Mary's [Teacher] Training College]], and in 1903 [[Edward VII|King Edward VII]] opened the [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast|Royal Victoria Hospital]] at the junction with the Grosvenor Road.<ref name="clarke">{{cite web |last=Clarke |first=Richard |year=1997 |title=History of the Royal Victoria Hospital |url=https://www.ums.ac.uk/inst/hrvh_rc.pdf |access-date=1 April 2019 |publisher=Ulster Medical Society}}</ref> Extensively redeveloped and expanded, the hospital has a staff of more than 8,500.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2023-11-10 |title=Royal Victoria Hospital staff parking in 80% of visitor spaces |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-67380561 |access-date=2024-02-08 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

Landmarks in the area include the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic-revival]] [[St Peter's Cathedral, Belfast|St Peter's Cathedral]] (1866, signature twin spires added in 1886);<ref>{{Cite web |title=St. Peter's Roman Catholic Cathedral &#124; What to See &#124; Belfast & Northern Ireland |url=https://www.inyourpocket.com/belfast/St.-Peter-s-Roman-Catholic-Cathedral_27946v}}</ref> [[Clonard Monastery]] (1911), the Conway Mill (1853/1901, re-developed as a community enterprise, arts and education centre in 1983);<ref>{{Cite web |title=Conway Mill |url=https://conway-mill.ie/ |access-date=2024-02-08 |website=Conway Mill}}</ref> [[Belfast City Cemetery]] (1869) and, best known for its republican graves, [[Milltown Cemetery]] (1869).

The area's greatest visitor attractions are its wall and gable-end murals. In contrast to those in loyalist areas, where Israel is typically the only outside reference, these range more freely beyond the local conflict frequently expressing solidarity with [[Palestinians]], with [[Cuba]], and with [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque]] and [[Catalonia|Catalan]] separatists.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CAIN: Murals: Rolston, Bill.

=== South Belfast ===
West Belfast is separated from South Belfast, and from the otherwise abutting loyalist districts of [[Sandy Row]] and the [[Donegall Road]], by rail lines, the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1 Motorway]] (to Dublin and the west); industrial and retail parks, and the remnants of the [[Blackstaff River|Blackstaff]] (Owenvarra) bog meadows.

Belfast began stretching up-river in the 1840s and 50s: out the [[Ormeau Road|Ormeau]] and [[Lisburn Road|Lisburn roads]] and, between them, running along a ridge of higher ground, the [[Malone Road]]. From "leafy" avenues of increasingly substantial (and in the course of time "mixed") housing, the Upper Malone broadened out into areas of parkland and villas.

Further out still, where they did not survive as public parks, from the 1960s the great-house demesnes of the city's former mill-owners and industrialists were developed for public housing: loyalist estates such as Seymour Hill and Belvoir. Meanwhile, in Malone and along the river embankments, new houses and apartment blocks have been squeezed in, increasing the general housing density.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Weatherall |first=Norman |title=South Belfast, Terrace and Villa |publisher=Cottage Publications |year=2002 |isbn=1-900935-28-7 |location=Donaghadee |pages=7}}</ref>

Beyond the Queen's University area the area's principal landmarks are the 15-storey tower block of [[Belfast City Hospital]] (1986) on the Lisburn Road, and the Lagan Valley Regional Park through which a [[towpath]] extends from the City-centre quayside to Lisburn.<ref name=":12">{{Cite web |title=Lagan Valley Regional Park {{!}} |url=https://www.laganvalley.co.uk/ |access-date=2024-02-03 |website=laganvalley.co.uk}}</ref>

East Belfast developed from the [[Queen's Bridge, Belfast|Queens Bridge]] (1843), through Ballymacarrett, east along the [[Newtownards Road]] and north (along the east shore of the Lough) up the [[Holywood, County Down|Holywood]] Road; and from the [[Albert Bridge, Belfast|Albert Bridge]] (1890) south east out the [[Cregagh]] and Castlereagh roads. The further out, the more substantial, and less religiously segregated, the housing until again encountering the city's outer ring of public housing estates: loyalist Knocknagoney, [[Lisnasharragh (District Electoral Area)|Lisnasharragh]], and [[Tullycarnet]].

This century, efforts have been made to add to East Belfast's two obvious visitor attractions: Samson & Goliath (the "banana yellow cranes" date only from the early 1970s)<ref name=":13" />{{rp|79}} and the [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Parliament Buildings at Stormont]]. What is marketed now as EastSide, features, at the intersection of the Connswater and Comber Greenways and next to the EastSide Visitor Centre, [[C. S.

=== City Centre ===
[[Belfast City Centre]] is roughly bounded by the ring roads constructed since the 1970s: the [[M3 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M3]] which sweeps across the dockland to the north; the Westlink that connects to the [[M1 motorway (Northern Ireland)|M1]] for points south and west; and, with less certainty, the Bruce Street and Bankmore connectors that tie back toward the Lagan at the Gasworks Business Park and the beginning of the Ormeau Road. This embraces "the Markets", the one remaining inner-city area of housing.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Limited |first=Alamy |title=The markets area belfast hi-res stock photography and images |url=https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/the-markets-area-belfast.html |access-date=2024-02-10 |website=Alamy}}</ref> Of the various markets, including those for the sale and shipping of livestock, from which it derives its name, only one survives, the former produce market, [[St George's Market|St George's]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Development of the Area – Market Social History |url=https://www.marketsocialhistory.com/the-area/ |access-date=2024-02-10}}</ref> now a food and craft market popular with visitors to the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=St. George's Market – Belfast |url=https://discovernorthernireland.com/things-to-do/st-georges-market-p676791 |access-date=2024-02-10 |website=Discover Northern Ireland}}</ref>

Among surviving elements of the pre-Victorian town are the [[The Belfast Entries|Belfast Entries]], 17th-century alleyways off High Street, including, in Winecellar Entry, White's Tavern (rebuilt 1790); the elliptical First [[Non-subscribing Presbyterian Church of Ireland|Presbyterian (Non-Subscribing)]] Church (1781–83) in Rosemary Street (whose members led the abolitionist charge against Greg and Cunningham);<ref>{{cite book |last1=O'Regan |first1=Raymond |title=Hidden Belfast |date=2010 |publisher=Mercier Press |isbn=978-1-85635-683-1 |location=Cork |pages=60–63}}</ref> the [[Assembly Rooms, Belfast|Assembly Rooms]] (1769, 1776, 1845) on Bridge Street; [[St George's Church, Belfast|St George's Church of Ireland]] (1816) on the High Street site of the old Corporation Church which had been built on a religious site dating back to 1306; [[St Mary's Church, Belfast|St Mary's Church]] (1782) in Chapel Lane, which is the oldest Catholic church in the city. The oldest public building in Belfast, [[Clifton House, Belfast|Clifton House]] (1771–74), the [[Belfast Charitable Society]] [[poorhouse]], is on North Queen Street. It is now partly cut off from the city centre by arterial roads. In addition there are small sets of city-centre [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] terraces.<ref name=":42">{{Cite book |last=Patton |first=Marcus |title=Central Belfast: An Historical Gazetteer |publisher=Ulster Architectural Heritage Society |year=1993 |isbn=0-900457-44-9 |location=Belfast}}</ref>

Of the much larger Victorian city a substantial legacy has survived the [[Belfast Blitz|Blitz]], The Troubles and planning and development. Among the more notable examples<ref name=":42" /> are [[St Malachy's Church, Belfast|St Malachy's Roman Catholic Church]] (1844) and the original college building of [[Queen's University Belfast]] (1849), both in a [[Tudor style architecture|Tudor style]]; the Palm House in the [[Botanic Gardens (Belfast)|Botanic Gardens]] (1852); the [[Renaissance Revival architecture|Renaissance revival]] [[Union Theological College]] (1853) and Ulster Bank (now [[Merchant Hotel (Belfast)|Merchant Hotel]]) (1860); the [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] [[Ulster Hall]] (1862), and the National Trust restored ornate [[Crown Liquor Saloon]] (1885, 1898) (a setting for the classic film, ''[[Odd Man Out]]'', starring [[James Mason]]);<ref>{{cite news |date=23 February 2007 |title=BBC seeks stars of Belfast film noir |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6388303.stm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226113327/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/6388303.stm |archive-date=26 February 2007 |access-date=23 May 2007 |publisher=BBC News Northern Ireland}}</ref>  the oriental-themed [[Grand Opera House (Belfast)|Grand Opera House]] (1895) (bombed several times during the Troubles),<ref>{{cite web |title=Grand Opera House |url=http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2061 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622053609/http://cinematreasures.org/theaters/2061 |archive-date=22 June 2011 |access-date=1 June 2007 |publisher=Cinema Treasures}}</ref>  and the Romanesque revival [[St Patrick's Church, Belfast|St. Patrick's Catholic Church]] in Donegall Street (1877).

The [[Baroque Revival architecture|Baroque revival]] [[Belfast City Hall|City Hall]] was finished in 1906 on the site of the former White Linen Hall, and was built to reflect Belfast's city status, granted by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1888. Its [[Edwardian Baroque architecture|Edwardian]] design influenced the [[Victoria Memorial (India)|Victoria Memorial]] in [[Kolkata|Calcutta]], India, and [[Durban]] City Hall in South Africa.<ref>{{cite book |last=Krishna |first=Dutta |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKfoHi5412UC&pg=PA132 |title=Calcutta: A Cultural and Literary History |publisher=Signal Books |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-902669-59-5 |page=132 |access-date=21 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529144512/https://books.google.com/books?id=UKfoHi5412UC&pg=PA132 |archive-date=29 May 2021 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Wines, Michael |date=25 May 2006 |title=Where the Road to Renaming Does Not Run Smooth |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416052505/http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/25/world/africa/25durban.html?_r=1&oref=slogin |archive-date=16 April 2009 |access-date=1 October 2007 |work=The New York Times}}</ref> The dome is {{convert|173|ft|m|abbr=on}} high and figures above the door state "[[Hibernia]] encouraging and promoting the Commerce and Arts of the City".<ref name="Go To Historic Buildings2">{{cite web |title=Historic Belfast: A guide to the City's landmark buildings |url=http://www.gotobelfast.com/index.cfm/level/page/category_key/197/Page_Key/428/Parent_Key/0/type/Page/PaGeName/Historic_Buildings_of_Belfast |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618164651/http://www.gotobelfast.com/index.cfm/level/page/category_key/197/Page_Key/428/Parent_Key/0/type/Page/PaGeName/Historic_Buildings_of_Belfast |archive-date=18 June 2007 |access-date=23 May 2007 |publisher=Go To Belfast}}</ref> 

Nearby is the Renaissance and Baroque revival Scottish Provident Institution (1902). Opposite is a branch of the [[Ulster Bank]] which is built behind the facade of a large former Methodist church which was built in the classical style and which opened in 1846.

Built around an older church dating to 1776, [[St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast|St Anne's Church of Ireland Cathedral]] was consecrated 1904 and completed in the 1920s. Its steel spire was added in 2007. The neoclassical [[Royal Courts of Justice, Belfast|Royal Courts of Justice]] were opened in 1933.

==== Redevelopment ====
The opening [[Victoria Square Shopping Centre]] in 2008 was to symbolise the rebound of the city centre since its days as a restricted security zone during the Troubles.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Arminas |first=David |date=2008 |title=Belfast's Victoria Square marks retail revival with showpiece dome |url=https://www.building.co.uk/belfasts-victoria-square-marks-retail-revival-with-showpiece-dome/3117116.article |access-date=2024-02-10 |website=Building}}</ref> But retail footfall in the centre is limited by competition with out-of-town shopping centres and with internet retailing.

==== Rough sleeping and homelessness ====
People can be found sleeping rough on the streets of the city centre. Numbers, while growing, may be comparatively small for a city of its size in the British Isles. In 2022, counts and estimates by the [[Northern Ireland Housing Executive]] identified a total of 26 rough sleepers in Belfast.<ref>{{Cite web |last=The Housing Executive |date=2024 |title=Rough sleeping: Tackling Rough Sleeping in Belfast |url=https://www.nihe.gov.uk/housing-help/homelessness/rough-sleeping |access-date=2024-03-23 |website=nihe.gov.uk}}</ref> This is against a background (in 2023) of 2,317 people (0.67% of residents) presenting as homeless, many of whom are in temporary accommodation and shelters.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Homeless Connect |date=2023-09-21 |title=Latest Homelessness Statistics show over 4,500 children living in temporary accommodation – Homeless Connect |url=https://homelessconnect.org/latest-homelessness-statistics-show-over-4500-children-living-in-temporary-accommodation/ |access-date=2024-03-23}}</ref> Such figures, however, do not include all those living in severely overcrowded conditions, involuntarily sharing with other households on a long-term basis, or sleeping rough in hidden locations.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Gray |first1=Ann Marie |url=https://simoncommunity.org/assets/pdfs/Hidden-Homelessness_Report_FINAL_2022-03-04-122611_qzze.pdf |title=Hidden Homelessness in Northern Ireland |last2=Hamilton |first2=Jennifer |publisher=Simon Community, Ulster University |year=2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2022-03-02 |title=Northern Ireland's 'hidden homeless' living life in limbo |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-60576166 |access-date=2024-03-23 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

Since 2001, buoyed by increasing numbers of tourists, the city council has promoted a number of cultural [[Belfast quarters|quarters]].

The [[Cathedral Quarter, Belfast|Cathedral Quarter]] comprises much of Belfast's old trade and warehousing district in the narrow streets and entries around [[St Anne's Cathedral, Belfast|St Anne's Cathedral]], with a concentration of bars, beer gardens, clubs and restaurants (including two establishments claiming descent from the early town, White's and The Duke of York)<ref>{{Cite web |last=Neil |first=Shasha |date=2023-04-14 |title=10 Oldest Pubs in Belfast |url=https://www.oldest.org/food/oldest-pubs-in-belfast/ |access-date=2024-02-17 |website=Oldest.org}}</ref> and performance spaces (most notably the Black Box and [[Oh Yeah (music centre)|Oh Yeah]]).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cathedral Quarter |url=https://visitbelfast.com/cathedral-quarter/ |access-date=2024-02-17 |website=Visit Belfast}}</ref><ref name="Cathedral Quarter2">{{cite web |year=2014 |title=The Cathedral Quarter, Belfast |url=http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/belfast/The-Cathedral-Quarter-Belfast-A2042 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140518205008/http://www.discovernorthernireland.com/belfast/The-Cathedral-Quarter-Belfast-A2042 |archive-date=18 May 2014 |access-date=18 May 2014 |publisher=[[Northern Ireland Tourist Board]]}}</ref> It hosts a yearly [[Cathedral Quarter Arts Festival|visual and performing arts festival]]. The adjoining [[Custom House, Belfast|Custom House]] Square is one of the city's main outdoor venues for free concerts and street entertainment.

Without defined geographical boundaries, the [[Gaeltacht Quarter, Belfast|Gaeltacht Quarter]] encompasses [[Irish language|Irish-speaking]] Belfast. (According to the 2021 census, 15.5% of people in the city have [[Irish language in Northern Ireland|some knowledge of Irish]], 4% speak it daily).<ref name=":02" /> It is generally understood as an area around the Falls Road in west Belfast served by the [[Cultúrlann McAdam Ó Fiaich]] cultural centre.<ref>{{cite web |year=2007 |title=Gaeltacht Quarter |url=http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/languages/gaeltacht_quarter.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927032912/http://www.dcalni.gov.uk/index/languages/gaeltacht_quarter.htm |archive-date=27 September 2007 |access-date=15 January 2016 |publisher=Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Gaeltacht Quarter |url=https://visitbelfast.com/gaeltacht-quarter/ |access-date=2024-01-26 |website=Visit Belfast}}</ref> It can be said to include, at the Skainos Centre in unionist east Belfast, [[Turas]], a project that promotes Irish through night classes and cultural events in the belief that "the language belongs to all".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lynch |first=Connor |date=2023-04-30 |title=Turas celebrates 10 years of the Irish language in East Belfast |url=https://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/belfast-news/turas-celebrates-10-years-irish-26805790 |access-date=2024-02-17 |website=Belfast Live}}</ref>

The [[Linen Quarter, Belfast|Linen Quarter]]', an area south of City Hall once dominated by linen warehouses, now includes, in addition to cafés, bars and restaurants, a dozen hotels (including the 23-storey [[Grand Central Hotel Belfast|Grand Central Hotel]]), and the city's two principal Victorian-era cultural venues, the [[Grand Opera House, Belfast|Grand Opera House]] and the [[Ulster Hall]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Linen Quarter {{!}} Attractions, See & Do |url=https://visitbelfast.com/partners/linen-quarter/ |access-date=2024-02-17 |website=Visit Belfast}}</ref>

Moving further south along the so-called  [[Golden Mile (Belfast)|"Golden Mile"]] of bars and clubs through [[Shaftesbury Square]], there is the [[Queen's Quarter, Belfast|Queen's [University] Quarter]]. In addition to the university (spread over 250 buildings, of which 120 are listed as being of architectural merit),<ref>{{cite web |year=2007 |title=About Queen's: Facts and Figures |url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/home/TheUniversity/AboutQueens/UniversityInformation/FactsandFigures/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070513043014/http://www.qub.ac.uk/home/TheUniversity/AboutQueens/UniversityInformation/FactsandFigures/ |archive-date=13 May 2007 |access-date=24 May 2007 |publisher=Queen's University Belfast}}</ref> it is home to [[Belfast Botanic Gardens|Botanic Gardens]] and the [[Ulster Museum]].<ref>{{cite web |year=2007 |title=Contact Details |url=http://www.ulstermuseum.org.uk/contact-us/contact-details/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070529080126/http://www.ulstermuseum.org.uk/contact-us/contact-details/ |archive-date=29 May 2007 |access-date=18 May 2007 |publisher=The Ulster Museum}}</ref>

Finally, the [[Titanic Quarter, Belfast|Titanic Quarter]] covers {{convert|0.75|km²|acre|0|abbr=on}} of reclaimed land adjacent to [[Port of Belfast|Belfast Harbour]], formerly known as ''Queen's Island''.

As Northern Ireland's capital city, Belfast is host to the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] at [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]], the site of the [[Devolution#Northern Ireland|devolved]] legislature for Northern Ireland. Belfast is divided into four [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] and [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK parliamentary]] constituencies: [[Belfast North (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast North]], [[Belfast West (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast West]], [[Belfast South (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast South]] and [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]]. All four extend beyond the city boundaries to include parts of [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh]], [[Lisburn City Council|Lisburn]] and [[Newtownabbey Borough Council|Newtownabbey]] districts. In [[Elections in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom elections]], each constituency returns one [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]], on a "[[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]]" basis to Westminster. In NI Assembly elections each returns, on the basis of [[proportional representation]], five [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (Northern Ireland)|MLAs]] to [[Parliament Buildings (Northern Ireland)|Stormont]].

In the [[2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election|Northern Ireland Assembly Elections in 2022]], Belfast elected 7 [[Sinn Féin]], 5 [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]], 5 [[Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|Alliance Party]], 1 [[Social Democratic and Labour Party|SDLP]], 1 [[Ulster Unionist Party|UUP]] and 1 [[People Before Profit Alliance|PBPA]] MLAs.<ref>{{cite news |date=7 May 2022 |title=Northern Ireland election |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election/2022/northern-ireland/results |access-date=24 May 2022 |work=BBC News}}</ref> In the [[2017 United Kingdom general election|2017 UK general election]], the DUP won all but the Sinn Féin stronghold of Belfast West.
