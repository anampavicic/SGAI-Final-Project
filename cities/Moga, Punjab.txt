'''Moga''' is a city in the [[India]]n [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. It was made a part and headquarters of the [[Moga district]] (the [[Districts of Punjab (India)|17th District]] in the state) on 24 November 1995, by the then [[Chief Minister of Punjab (India)|Chief Minister]] [[Harcharan Singh Brar]]. Before becoming a district, Moga was a part of [[Faridkot District]] as a [[tehsil]]. Moga is situated on the [[National Highway 95 (India)|National Highway 95]] (NH-95 [[Ferozpur]]-[[Ludhiana]] road). The area of [[Dharamkot, Moga|Dharamkot]] block with 150 villages has been merged into Moga district, which falls under the jurisdiction of Ferozpur division.

== Etymology ==
The name of Moga may be 
derived from the [[Indo-Scythians|Indo-Scythian]] king, [[Maues]], who invaded and ruled the area in the 1st century BCE after conquering the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom|Indo-Greek]] polities of the region.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Samad |first=Rafi U. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PMEd8Cqh-YQC&pg=PA66 |title=The Grandeur of Gandhara: The Ancient Buddhist Civilization of the Swat, Peshawar, Kabul and Indus Valleys |date=2011 |publisher=Algora Publishing |isbn=978-0-87586-860-8 |language=en}}</ref>
 	
The city may also have been named after Moga Gill, who along his brother Vega Gill, were men of importance among the Wadan Gills.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Ferozepore District Gazetteer |publisher=Revenue Department, Punjab |year=1916 |pages=78–79}}</ref>

== History ==

=== Ancient era ===
The location of ancient villages and towns can be inferred from the presence of mounds of earth, brick, and pottery that have been excavated called ''thehs''. These mounds are evidence that the banks of the river were inhabited in ancient times. Several coins have been discovered at the site of these mounds.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last= |title=Punjab District Gazetteers - Chapter II History |url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/read/45440111/chapter-ii-history-moga-was-carved-out-as-a-separate-district- |access-date=16 August 2022 |website=yumpu.com |publisher=Department of Revenue, Government of Punjab. |language=en}}</ref>

==== Indus Valley civilisation ====
Sites identified as belonging to the [[Indus Valley Civilisation|Indus Valley Civilization]] have been discovered in the area. Scholars have linked these finds to other sites uncovered in the Rupnagar area of Punjab.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/11915695 |title=Frontiers of the Indus civilization : Sir Mortimer Wheeler commemoration volume |date=1984 |publisher=Published by Books & Books on behalf of Indian Archaeological Society jointly with Indian History & Culture Society |others=Mortimer Wheeler, B.

==== Vedic period ====
The composition of the [[Rigveda]] is proposed to have occurred in the Punjab circa 1500 and 1200 BCE.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Flood |first=Gavin D. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50516193 |title=An introduction to Hinduism |date=1996 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-43304-5 |location=New York, NY |oclc=50516193}}</ref>

==== Post-Vedic period (After 600 BCE) ====
The region of Moga belongs to the [[Malwa (Punjab)|Malwai]] cultural zone, named after the ancient [[Malavas|Malava]] tribe whom inhabited the area in ancient times.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=Prakash |first=Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ckefbLYCyqEC |title=Glimpses of Ancient Panjab |date=1966 |publisher=Punjabi University, Department of Punjab Historical Studies |language=en}}</ref> During the reign of [[Porus the Elder|Porus]] in the 4th century BCE, the southern area of Punjab was ruled by both the Kshudrakas and Malavas. Some scholars believe they were pushed southwards due to martial and social pressures occurring in the north.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Prakash |first=Buddha |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qaQBAAAAMAAJ |title=Political and Social Movements in Ancient Panjab (from the Vedic Age Upto [sic] the Maurya Period) |date=1964 |publisher=M. Banarsidass |language=en}}</ref> [[Alexander the Great|Alexander of Macedon]] warred with the Malavas for control of the region. This wrestle for power is recorded as being fierce and bitter in Greek historical accounts.<ref name=":1" /> After the withdrawal of [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|Macedonian]] forces in the area, the Malavas joined with anti-Greek forces to usurp Hellenistic power and control of the region, leading to the formation of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan]] dynasty.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

The decline of the Mauryan dynasty coincided with an invasion of [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Bactrian Greeks]], who successfully took control of the region in the second century BCE. This seizure of power in Punjab by the Bactrians led to the migration of the Malavas from the area to [[Rajasthan]] and from there to the now called [[Malwa]] plateau of Central India covering southern Rajasthan and western Madhya Pradesh.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

=== Mediaeval era ===
The area is believed to have been under the writ of the Punwar clan of [[Rajput]]s during the early mediaeval period.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cunningham |first=Alexander |url=https://archive.org/details/in.gov.ignca.85044 |title=Archeological Survey of India Report of Tours in the Punjab in 1878-79 vol.14 |date=14 September 2016 |publisher=Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) |isbn=978-1-333-58993-6 |volume=XIV |pages=67–69}}</ref> They were headquartered in Janer, at the old riverbed location of the Sutlej river, over six kilometres north of the present-day city of Moga. Later on, the Bhati clan of Rajputs, originating from [[Jaisalmer district|Jaisalmer]], established themselves in the area, superseding the previous Punwars for the authority in the region.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

[[Jats|Jat]] tribes, whom had been practising migratory, [[Nomadic pastoralism|nomadic-pastoralism]] for much of their recorded history, began to permanently settle the Moga area during this time and take up a sedentary lifestyle of settled agriculture.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Asher |first=Catherine B. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/61303480 |title=India before Europe |date=2006 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |others=Cynthia Talbot |isbn=0-521-80904-5 |location=New York |oclc=61303480}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/820853396 |title=Nomads in the sedentary world |date=2001 |publisher=Routledge |others=Anatoly M.

While they were left unnamed by the Chinese pilgrim, these same people of lower Sind were called Jats' or 'Jats of the wastes' by the Arab geographers.

The jats were one of the chief pastoral-nomadic divisions here in early-medieval times, and although some of these migrated as far as Iraq, they generally did not move over very long distances on a regular basis. Many jats migrated to the north, into the Panjab, and here, between the eleventh and sixteenth centuries, the once largely pastoral-nomadic Jat population was transformed into sedentary peasants. Some Jats continued to live in the thinly populated barr country between the five rivers of the Panjab, adopting a kind of transhumance, based on the herding of goats and camels. It seems that what happened to the jats is paradigmatic of most other pastoral and pastoral-nomadic populations in India in the sense that they became ever more closed in by an expanding sedentary-agricultural realm."}}</ref> First of them being the [[Dhaliwal (surname)|Dhaliwal]] clan, who firmly established themselves southeast of Moga at Kangar. They appear to have possibly obtained high repute, seeing as a woman of the clan, Dharm, who was the daughter of Chaudhary Mihr Mitha Dhaliwal''',''' was wedded to the Mughal emperor Akbar.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Dalal |first=Sukhvir Singh |date=April 2013 |title=Jat Jyoti |url=http://jatjyoti.in/ |journal=Jat Jyoti |publisher=Jat Biographical Centre |publication-place=Jat Biographical Centre B-49, First Floor, Church Road, Joshi Colony, I. P. Extension Delhi 110092 |page=7}}</ref> The [[Gill clan|Gill]] clan of Jats, originally based in [[Bathinda district|Bathinda]], dispersed to the western parts of Moga district around this time. At the end of the 16th century, the [[Sidhu]] clan of Jats migrated northwards to the area from Rajasthan. A branch of the Sidhus, the [[Brar (surname)|Brars]], established themselves in the south of Gill territory, pushing its former inhabitants northwards whilst taking control of their key places in the process. The Brars founded a chieftainship at [[Kotkapura|Kot Kapura]], 40 kilometres west of present-day Moga, and rebelled against the overlordship of Nawab Ise Khan, the Manj governor. Most of the Jat tribes of the local area were converted to [[Sikhism]] by the missionary works of the seventh [[Guru]] of the Sikhs, [[Guru Har Rai|Har Rai]].{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Structures and sites dating before the reign of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperor [[Akbar]] are exceedingly rare due to the changing course of the [[Sutlej]] river throughout the centuries. As a result, very few sites dating back to [[Ancient history|antiquity]] have been uncovered in the local area of Moga. This effect is more pronounced in the western parts of the district.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

In 1715 CE, Nawab Ise Khan, the Manj governor, stirred a rebellion against the Mughal hegemony but was defeated and killed. In 1760 CE, the ascendency of Sikh power became grounded after the defeat of [[Adina Beg]], who was the last [[Subah of Lahore|Mughal governor of Lahore]].{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

==== Sikh period ====
The forces of [[Sardar Tara Singh Ghaiba|Tara Singh]], the misldar of the [[Dallewalia Misl]] of the [[Misl|Sikh Confederacy]], led incursions into modern-day Moga district, all the way to Ramuwala and Mari. Fortresses (ਕਿਲਾ ''Kilā'' in Punjabi) were constructed at both places by the Sikh misl. The local nawab of [[Kot Ise Khan]] in modern-day Moga district became a protectorate of the [[Ahluwalia (misl)|Ahluwalia Misl]]. In 1763-64 CE, Gurja (Gujar) Singh, his brother Nusbaha Singh, and his two nephews, Gurbaksh Singh and Mastan Singh, of the [[Bhangi Misl]], crossed the Sutlej river after a sacking of Kasur and gained control of the Firozepur area (including Moga) whilst Jai Singh Gharia, another band from the same quarters, seized Khai, Wan, and Bazidpur, and subordinated them.<ref name=":0" />

==== British period ====
During the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]], the forces of the [[Sikh Empire]] crossed the river Sutlej on 16 December 1845, and fought battles at Mudki, Firozshah, Aliwal, and Sabraon. The Sikh forces were defeated by the British and retreated beyond the Sutlej. After the war, the British acquired all former territory of the Lahore Darbar south and east of the Sutlej. When the Sutlej campaign finished at the end of 1846, the territories of Khai, Baghuwala, Ambarhar, Zira, and Mudki, with portions of Kot Kapura, Guru Har Sahai, Jhumba, Kot Bhai, Bhuchcho, and Mahraj were added to the Firozepur district. Other acquisitions by the British were divided between the Badhni and Ludhiana districts. In 1847, the Badhni district was dissolved and the following areas were incorporated into the Firozepur district: Mallanwala, Makhu, Dharmkot, Kot Ise Khan, Badhni, Chuhar Chak, Mari, and Sadasinghwala.<ref name=":0" />

During the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|Mutiny of 1857]], there were reports of a Roman Catholic church being burnt down amongst other buildings of the colonial establishment in Firozepur district during sparks of tension.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Punjab Government Records, Mutiny Reports |volume=VIII |pages=Pt.I, pp. 47–57, pt.II, pp. 208–210, 331}}</ref>

During the late 19th century, the [[Namdhari|Kuka movement]] was prevalent in the areas of Moga, with many of its followers drawing from the laypersons of the district.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kukas.

=== Post Independence Period ===
Following independence in 1948, the Sikh Maharaja of Faridkot's princely reign came to an end, and the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was proclaimed as the new governing body. Moga was granted the status of an independent district, and the Faridkot District was forced to relinquish it in November 1995.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Moga, Important Historical Significance of Moga |url=https://www.mogaonline.in/city-guide/history-of-moga#:-:text=Post%2520Independence%2520%20Moga,status%2520%25%2020an%25%2020independent%2520district.%20L |access-date=6 April 2024 |website=www.mogaonline.in}}</ref>

The district and city have developed into a thriving, rapidly improving area that has made significant progress. The district has been firmly established on the national map thanks to the commercial and tourism opportunities in the area.
