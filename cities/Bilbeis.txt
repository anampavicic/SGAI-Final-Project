'''Bilbeis''' ({{langx|ar|بلبيس}}&nbsp;{{IPA|ar|belˈbeːs|pron}}; Bohairic {{langx|cop|Ⲫⲉⲗⲃⲉⲥ/Ⲫⲉⲗⲃⲏⲥ}} ''{{transliteration|cop|P<sup>h</sup>elbes/P<sup>h</sup>elbēs}}''<span style="margin-left:1px">)</span> is an ancient [[fortress]] city on the eastern edge of the southern [[Nile delta|Nile Delta]] in [[Egypt]], the site of the ancient city and former bishopric of '''Phelbes''' and a Latin Catholic [[titular see]].

The city is small in size but densely populated, with over 407,300 residents. It also houses the [[Egyptian Air Academy|Egyptian Air Force Academy]] complex, which contains the town's largest public school in Al-Zafer.

[[Coptic Orthodox Church|Coptic]] tradition says that Bilbeis was one of the stopping places of [[Holy Family|the Holy Family]] during the [[Flight into Egypt]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ccdl.claremont.edu/digital/collection/cce/id/358/rec/5|title=Bilbeis|website=ccdl.claremont.edu}}</ref>

== History ==
The city was important enough in the [[Roman province]] of [[Augustamnica Secunda]] to become a bishopric.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Situated on a caravan and natural invasion route from the east, Bilbeis was conquered in 640 by the Arabs. [[Amr ibn al-As]] besieged and took the city defended by a [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] general called al-Ardubun. According to a Muslim legend, Armanusa, the daughter of [[Al-Muqawqis|Muqawqis]] lived in Bilbeis.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Amr ibn al-Aas |url=https://youwikiiw.com/wiki/%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%88_%D8%A8%D9%86_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D8%B5 |access-date=2022-09-01 |website=Encyclopedia. |language=da}}</ref> In 727 some of the [[Qays|Qays tribe]] were resettled here and later chain of fortresses was built to protect [[Cairo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bilbays|title=Bilbays &#124; Egypt &#124; Britannica|website=www.britannica.com|date=5 February 2024 }}</ref>

The city played a role in the machinations for control of the [[Fatimid]] [[vizier]]ate: first in 1164, when [[Shirkuh]] was besieged in the city by the combined forces of [[Shawar]] and crusader king [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] for three months; then again in 1168 when the city was assaulted again by Amalric's army, who took the city after three days on 4 November and indiscriminately killed the inhabitants.<ref>[http://www.mmdtkw.org/CrusadesMaster.pdf Crusades] mmdtkw.org</ref> (See [[Crusader invasion of Egypt]].)

In 1798, its [[fortification]]s were rebuilt at the order of [[Napoleon]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}
