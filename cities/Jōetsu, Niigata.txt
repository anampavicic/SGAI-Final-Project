{{Nihongo|'''Jōetsu'''|上越市|Jōetsu-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Niigata Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2020|12|01}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 189,430, in 76,461 households<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.city.joetsu.niigata.jp/soshiki/shiminka/jinko.html |title=Jōetsu city official statistics |lang=ja }}</ref> with a [[population density]] of 190 persons per km<sup>2</sup>. The total area of the city was {{convert|973.81|sqkm|sqmi}}. Jōetsu borders the [[Sea of Japan]] and is renowned for its abundance of snow, the annual cherry-blossom festival, ''[[sake]]'' and ''[[Koshihikari]]'' rice.

==Geography==
[[File:Naoetsu Beach.jpg|thumb|Sea of Japan at Naoetsu Beach]]
Jōetsu is in southwest Niigata Prefecture, bordered by the [[Sea of Japan]] to the north and [[Nagano Prefecture]] to the south. It is approximately 133 kilometers west of the city of [[Niigata, Niigata|Niigata]], the prefectural capital and 139 kilometers east of [[Toyama, Toyama|Toyama]].

===Mountains===
Surrounded by the [[Japanese Alps]], Jōetsu contains four noteworthy mountains:

*Hishigatake-yama - part of the Shin-etsu trail and one location of the annual "Candle Road" festival
*Kanayasan - birthplace of skiing in Japan
*Kasugayama - formerly the location of [[Kasugayama Castle]], home of the [[Sengoku period]] ''[[daimyō]]'', [[Uesugi Kenshin]]
*Yoneyama - a sacred mountain on the border of Joetsu and neighboring Kashiwazaki City

Although part of neighboring city [[Myōkō, Niigata|Myōkō]], [[Mount Myōkō]] can also be vividly seen from Joetsu. Known for its heavy snowfall and ski resorts, Mt. Myōkō is listed as one of the [[100 Famous Japanese Mountains]], and is considered the "[[Mount Fuji]] of Echigo".

===Climate===
Jōetsu has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''). The average annual temperature is 13.4&nbsp;°C. The average annual rainfall is 2599&nbsp;mm with January as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.0&nbsp;°C, and lowest in January, at around 2.2&nbsp;°C.<ref>[https://en.climate-data.org/location/5507/ Jōetsu climate data]</ref>

Owing to its coastal location facing onshore winds off the Sea of Japan, Jōetsu is the wettest low-lying part of the northern hemisphere temperate zone apart from the [[Owase, Mie|Owase]] region of the [[Kii Peninsula]], receiving an average of around {{convert|2.8|m|in|1}} of precipitation per year. As a comparison, [[Forks, Washington|Forks]] on the windward side of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington's]] [[Olympic Peninsula]] receives {{convert|110|in|m|2}} and [[Rize]] on the Black Sea coast of Turkey {{convert|2530|mm|in|0}}. The cold winds from the combined power of the [[Siberian High]] and [[Aleutian Low]] give Jōetsu an average of {{convert|6.3|m|in|-1}} of snowfall that however tends to melt significantly even during the winter. On February 26, 1945, Jōetsu received as much as {{convert|3.77|m|in|0}} of snow in one day. The heaviest annual snowfall, since the beginning of regular snowfall measurements in 1953, was {{convert|14.94|m|in|-1}} in the 1985/1986 season and the heaviest monthly total precipitation {{convert|942|mm|in|0}} in January 1945, whilst the driest month was August 1985 with {{convert|16|mm|in}}.

==Toponymy==
The ''[[kanji]]'' for Jōetsu combines {{Nihongo2|上}} "upward", {{Nihongo2|越}} "to surpass" and {{Nihongo2|市}} "city", which can be misleading as the city is located in the southwestern part of Niigata Prefecture, closer to Toyama and Nagano Prefectures, as opposed to more northern areas in Niigata. Prior to the [[Meiji Restoration]], [[Echigo Province]] was divided into three sections. One portion was called {{Nihongo||上越後|Kami Echigo}}, which was translated as "Upper Echigo", due its geographical proximity to the capital city of Kyoto. After the establishment of prefectures throughout Japan, the region name was shortened to {{Nihongo||上越|"Jōetsu"}}. When referring to Jōetsu, it could refer to the actual geographical Jōetsu region, which encompasses the cities of Jōetsu, [[Myōkō, Niigata|Myōkō]] and [[Itoigawa]], or may simply refer to the city of Jōetsu .<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pref.niigata.lg.jp/link_jouetsu.html |script-title=ja:リンク集：上越地域 |trans-title=Joetsu Region Information |access-date=July 26, 2018 |publisher=Niigata Prefecture}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Amalgamation Joetsu jp.svg|thumb|'''Yellow''': 13 former municipalities merged into Joetsu in 2005.]]

The area of present-day Jōetsu has been inhabited for thousands of years, and the ruins of numerous [[Jōmon period]] and [[Kofun period]] settlements, tombs and fortifications have been found. The area was part of ancient [[Echigo Province]], and the location of the [[Nara period]] [[kokufu|provincial capital]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], it was the center of the holdings of the [[Uesugi clan]] and notably [[Kasugayama Castle]] was the headquarters of the famed warlord [[Uesugi Kenshin]]. The [[Uesugi clan]] were transferred by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] to [[Aizu]] and the area later came under the [[Takada Domain]] during the [[Edo period]] [[Tokugawa Shogunate]].

In 1614, [[Matsudaira Tadateru]], the 6th son of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was assigned to Echigo Province and ordered the construction of [[Takada Castle]]. The domain was later ruled by a number of ''[[fudai daimyō]]'' houses. The last ''[[daimyō]]'' of Takada Domain was [[Sakakibara Masataka]], who sided with the imperial forces in the [[Boshin War]] of the [[Meiji restoration]] and who subsequently served as imperial governor until the [[abolition of the han system]] in 1871 by the [[Meiji government]].

The towns of Takada and Naoetsu were created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Takada was elevated to city status on September 1, 1911 and Naoetsu on June 1, 1954. Takada and Naoetsu merged to form the city of Jōetsu in 1971.

On January 1, 2005, Jōetsu annexed 13 neighbouring municipalities, expanding its area by four times. The municipalities that were annexed into consisted of the following: the town of [[Yasuzuka, Niigata|Yasuzuka]], the villages of [[Maki, Niigata (Higashikubiki)|Maki]], [[Ōshima, Niigata|Ōshima]] and [[Uragawara, Niigata|Uragawara]] (all from [[Higashikubiki District, Niigata|Higashikubiki District]]); the towns of [[Itakura, Niigata|Itakura]], [[Kakizaki, Niigata|Kakizaki]], [[Ōgata, Niigata|Ōgata]] and [[Yoshikawa, Niigata|Yoshikawa]], and the villages of [[Kiyosato, Niigata|Kiyosato]], [[Kubiki, Niigata|Kubiki]], [[Nakagō, Niigata|Nakagō]] and [[Sanwa, Niigata|Sanwa]] (all from [[Nakakubiki District, Niigata|Nakakubiki District]]); and the town of and [[Nadachi, Niigata|Nadachi]] (from [[Nishikubiki District, Niigata|Nishikubiki District]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joetsukankonavi.jp/spot-en.php?id=366 |title=Takada jo sanju yagura (Takada Castle Three-story-Turret) |access-date=June 18, 2018 |publisher=Jōetsu Kanko Navi}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://joetsukankonavi.jp/spot-en.php?id=167 |title=Sakaki Shrine |access-date=June 18, 2018 |publisher=Jōetsu Kanko Navi}}</ref> On April 1, 2007, Jōetsu attained [[Special cities of Japan|Special city]] status, which gives it greater local autonomy from the prefectural government.

===Skiing in Japan===
The victory in the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1905 brought about newfound interest in Japanese [[military strategy]] which prompted European powers to send troops to Japan to study new methods of combat. One of the soldiers, an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] major named [[Theodor von Lerch]], made a profound difference to the Jōetsu locals as well as the nation itself by introducing the sport of [[skiing]] to Japan. On January 12, 1911, Lerch began his ski training on Mt. Kanaya. The participants consisted of both soldiers and civilians. Lerch taught using the "Stemboggen" method, which involved a single bamboo pole that served a dual purpose as a steering tool and as a brake. With the translation help of the [[13th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|IJA 13th Division]] commander [[Gaishi Nagaoka]], the Takada Ski Club eventually amassed over 6,000 members in 1912. Soon after, skiing spread across the nation, especially in areas where snow dominated the landscape. It provided a new mode of transportation not only for the military, but for those who were rendered immobile by the seemingly impassible slopes of white. To commemorate his contribution, the Japan Ski Origins Museum was erected on Mt. Kanaya in time to coincide with the 80th anniversary of skiing's inception in Japan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://joetsukankonavi.jp/spot-en.php?id=10 |title=Japan Ski Origins Museum |access-date=June 18, 2018 | publisher=Jōetsu Kanko Navi}}</ref>

===World War II===
During World War II, the city of Naoetsu was the site of a POW camp that garnered international focus from the best-selling biography, ''[[Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption]]'' by [[Laura Hillenbrand]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://laurahillenbrandbooks.com/ |title=Unbroken |access-date=August 2, 2018 | publisher=laurahillenbrandbooks}}</ref> and later, the movie adaptation, [[Unbroken (film)|"Unbroken"]] in 2014. The book and movie focus on former Olympic track star [[Louis Zamperini]] and the brutal mistreatment of him and his fellow soldiers at the hands of the Imperial Japanese Army corporal, [[Mutsuhiro Watanabe]], infamously known as "The Bird". According to the book, Watanabe fled Naoetsu after the Allied forces invaded Japan and was never charged, despite being one of General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s top 40 most-wanted [[war criminal]]s.

The Naoetsu POW camp also housed over 300 Australian soldiers, 60 of which died from sickness and poor living conditions. In October 1995, fifty years following the end of the war, the Peace Memorial Park and Peace Statues were founded and built by Jōetsu to promote peace and friendship. The following year, the Japan-Australia Society of Jōetsu was established with the purpose of educating future generations and maintaining a lasting relationship with Australian citizens abroad and living throughout Joetsu.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.max.hi-ho.ne.jp/yoshi-ko/indexe.htm |title=Japan-Australia Society of Joetsu |access-date=August 2, 2018 | publisher=Japan-Australia Society of Joetsu}}</ref>

==Government==
[[File:Joetsu city hall.JPG|right|thumb|Joetsu City Hall]]
Jōetsu has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city legislature of 32 members. The city contributes five members to the Niigata Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Niigata at-large district]] in the [[House of Councillors (Japan)|upper house]] of the [[National Diet]] of Japan, and [[Niigata 6th District]] in the [[House of Representatives (Japan)|lower house]].

==Economy==
Jōetsu is a regional commercial and industrial centre, with heavy industry concentrated around the port of former Naoetsu, and light manufacturing and commerce around the former Takada area. The [[Jōetsu Thermal Power Station]] is an LNG-fired [[thermal power station]] operated by [[JERA]] in the city.
