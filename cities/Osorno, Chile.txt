'''Osorno''' ([[Mapuche language|Mapuche]]: Chauracavi) is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] in southern [[Chile]] and capital of [[Osorno Province]] in the [[Los Lagos Region]]. It had a population of 145,475, as of the 2002 census. It is located {{convert|945|km}} south of the national capital of [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], {{convert|105|km}} north of the [[Regions of Chile|region]]al capital of [[Puerto Montt]] and {{convert|260|km}} west of the [[Argentina|Argentine]] city of [[San Carlos de Bariloche]], connected via International Route 215 through the [[Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass]]. It is a gateway for land access to the [[Zona Austral|far south]] regions of [[Aysén Region|Aysén]] and [[Magallanes Region|Magallanes]], which would otherwise be accessible only by sea or air from the rest of the country.

Located at the confluence of [[Rahue River|Rahue]] and [[Damas River (Chile)|Damas River]], Osorno is the main service centre of agriculture and cattle farming in the northern Los Lagos Region. The city's cultural heritage is shaped by [[Huilliche]], [[Spanish Chileans|Spanish]], and [[German Chilean|German]] influences.

==History==
===Prehistory===
{{See also|Pilauco Bajo}}
The city of Osorno is built upon [[terrace (geology)|river terraces]] formed during the last of Earth's geological periods —the [[Quaternary]]. 130,000 years ago, during the transition from the [[Santa María glaciation]] and the [[Eemian|Valdivia interglacial]] the area of Osorno was covered by [[pyroclast]]ic material derivative from large and [[explosive eruption|explosive]] volcanic eruptions in the [[Andes]].<ref name=Pino>{{cite book |last1=Pino |first1=Mario|last2=Martel-Cea |first2=Alejandra|last3=Vega |first3=Rodrigo M.|last4=Fritte |first4=Daniel|last5=Soto-Bollmann |first5=Karin |date=2016|chapter=Geología y Geomrofología del sitio Pilauco |title=El Sitio Pilauco: Osorno, Patagonia Nordoccidental de Chile|editor-last=Pino Quivira|editor-first=Mario|editor-link=Mario Pino Quivira |publisher=Imprenta América |pages=12–46 |language=es}}</ref> The substrate of Osorno is accordingly made of various combinations of [[volcanic ash]], [[lapilli]], [[sand]] and [[gravel]] with occasional layers of [[peat]].<ref name=Pino/> The city hosts the paleontological and [[archaeological site]] of [[Pilauco Bajo]], where human [[footprint]]s and lithic artifacts dating to the [[Late Pleistocene]] have been found.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=A late Pleistocene human footprint from the Pilauco archaeological site, northern Patagonia, Chile|journal=[[PLOS One]]|last1=Moreno|first1=Karen|date=2019-04-24|last2=Bostelmann|first2=Juan Enrique|last3=Macías|first3=Cintia|last4=Navarro-Harris|first4=Ximena|last5=De Pol-Holz|first5=Ricardo|last6=Pino|first6=Mario|volume=14|issue=4|pages=e0213572|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0213572|pmid=31017908|pmc=6481816|bibcode=2019PLoSO..1413572M |author-link6=Mario Pino Quivira|doi-access=free}}</ref> There is an adjoining museum and park dedicated to the site.

===Old Osorno===
The city was originally planned to be founded in 1553, under the Government of [[Pedro de Valdivia]] by his companion of conquest, Lieutenant General Don [[Francisco de Villagra]]; with the name of '''Santa Marina de Gaete''', on the site of a [[Huilliche]] village named ''Chauracavi''. However, Valdivia's death prevented the realization of this plan before it could materialize.
 
On 27 March 1558, the city was finally founded by governor [[García Hurtado de Mendoza, 5th Marquis of Cañete|García Hurtado de Mendoza]], with the new name of ''Villa de San Mateo de Osorno'', in honor of his grandfather, Count of [[Osorno la Mayor|Osorno]].<ref name=BA2000-II-132>Barros Arana 2000, II, p. 132</ref> Osorno is a [[municipio]] in [[Palencia (province)|Palencia province]], [[Castile and León]], Spain. In the summer of 1567, various settlers of Osorno joined [[Martín Ruiz de Gamboa|Ruiz de Gamboa]]'s expedition to [[Chiloé Archipelago]].<ref name=BA2000-II-277>Barros Arana 2000, II, p. 277</ref> On December 1575 Osorno was struck [[1575 Valdivia earthquake|a major earthquake]] and the following year hostilities between Spanish and Mapuches, which had begun farther north, reached Osorno.<ref name=BA2000-II-332>Barros Arana 2000, II, p. 332</ref> Osorno was destroyed again by the indigenous [[Huilliche]] people in October 1602. The destruction of Osorno forced Spaniards and the remaining indigenous allies to migrate south to the vicinity of [[Chiloé Archipelago]] where Spanish rule was still upheld. Indigenous allies the followed the Spanish on their departure were declared [[indios reyunos]] and became free of encomienda and held the duty to form a [[militia]].<ref name=Mansilla>{{Citation

The plains of Osorno and the whole area between [[Valdivia]] and the settlements of Calbuco and Carelmapu remained [[Futahuillimapu|independent indigenous territory]] closed to the Spanish.

===New Osorno===
{{See also|Parliament of Las Canoas|German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue}}
On 22 November 1792, [[Tomás de Figueroa]] who headed [[Huilliche uprising of 1792|a military expedition]] from [[Valdivia]] took possession of the ruins. The [[Parliament of Las Canoas]] held in 1793 established anew peace between Spanish and Mapuche-Huilliche.<ref name=Salvador2020/> The treaty allowed for Spanish control of a strip of land between [[Rahue River|Rahue]] (the known as Río de Las Canoas) and [[Damas River (Chile)|Damas]] rivers, which including the area of Osorno.<ref name=Salvador2020/> Local chiefs [[Catrihuala]], Iñil and Caniu from around Osorno, and other from farther away, participated in the meeting.<ref name=Salvador2020/>

Under the orders of [[Ambrosio O'Higgins]], Osorno was again rebuilt by [[Juan Mackenna]], and declared officially re-populated in 1796. O'Higgins, in turn, was awarded the title of Marquess of Osorno. The new settlers of Osorno soon begun to purchase land from the local indigenous families of Catrihuala, Caniu and Colin.<ref name=Salvador2020>{{Cite thesis|title=Gallito Catrilef: Colonialismo y defensa de la tierra en San Juan de la Costa a mediados del siglo XX|last=Rumian Cisterna|first=Salvador|date=2020-09-17|degree=M.Sc.|publisher=[[University of Los Lagos]]|url=|language=Spanish}}</ref> These purchases were permitted by local governor [[Juan Mackenna]], who did however claim to have prevented local Huilliche sell lands they needed for subsistence.<ref name=Salvador2020/> According Mackenna local [[cacique]]s sold land to purchase liquour.<ref name=Salvador2020/>

Osorno owes its legacy to fairly recent Chilean settlement, when the government subdued the region's indigenous [[Mapuche]] peoples in the mid-19th century and opened the land to Chilean and European immigration soon to follow. A large percentage of locals in Osorno are descendants of Spanish (the livestock grazing industry owes its foundation to the [[Basque people|Basques]]) and other European immigrants.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

Around 1850, the government of Chile began inviting German settlers to the colony to promote growth in the region; the settlers found Osorno's climate and geography to be very similar to their own. It continues to have a thriving German secondary school.<ref name="aleman">{{cite web | url=https://www.ibo.org/school/004896/ | title =  Instituto Alemán de Osorno | access-date = 13 April 2021}}</ref> With their help, Osorno was made the home of the National Cattle ranch of Chile, boosting the regional economy significantly.

Osorno has a long history of rivalry with [[Valdivia (city)|Valdivia]], and in a 2006 referendum, the [[Osorno Province]] rejected its proposed incorporation into the new [[Los Ríos Region]], of which Valdivia is now the capital.

==The city==
[[File:Plaza de armas de Osorno en temporada navideña de 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Plaza de Armas]]]]
Osorno sits in sight of [[Osorno (volcano)|Volcán Osorno]], an active but minor volcano. The city's most prominent geographical feature is the [[Rahue River]] that runs north–south through its center. A smaller stream breaks off as well, running east before turning south and giving the city some natural boundaries. Located near the river front on the east side is the city's heart, the [[Plaza de Armas]], a large, one-block park with fountains, benches, and tree-lined avenues. On the park's east side is ''[[Cathedral|La Catedral]]'' of [[Matthew the Evangelist|Saint Matthew]], one of the city's major landmarks, notable for its modern architecture. The cathedral serves as [[mother church]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Diocese of Osorno, Chile|Diocese of Osorno]]. Along the south side is [[Juan Mackenna]] Avenue, the city's major city centre street. Other points of interest are the main campus of the [[Universidad de Los Lagos]] and the [[Medialuna de Osorno|Osorno Rodeo Stadium]].  The recently opened [[casino]] ''Plaza Sol de los Lagos'' is a new popular attraction for tourists and locals alike.

Osorno hosts a number of annual celebrations. The ''Festival de la Carne y la Leche'' (Milk and Meat Festival) is a [[music festival]] held annually in late January, features performances by national music pop singers and bands. The ''Festival del Folklore Campesino'' (Country Folk Festival) held annually in mid-January, features performances of regional music folk artists.

Another celebration is the ''Feria Ganadera Sago Fisur'' (Sago-Fisur Cattle Fair) held annually in early November, hosted by the largest ranch in the area highlights the current state of agricultural activity. Fireworks displays are held every year around the city on 18 September, the Chilean national Day, commemorating independence from [[Spain]].

Osorno is also a gateway for many tourist attractions. [[Puyehue National Park]] is a major attraction, with pristine lakes, forests, and game preserves. The [[Antillanca Group|volcanic area]] provides natural hot springs, now the site of the Aguas Calientes spa. ''Puyehue Hot Springs'' is adjacent to the park.

Los Lagos Region was named for the many lakes in the area, many of which have tourist-friendly yet isolated beaches; closest to Osorno are [[Puyehue Lake|Puyehue]] and [[Rupanco Lake|Rupanco]].<ref name=tur>[http://www.turistel.cl Turistel]; map found [http://www.turistel.cl/secciones/mapas/ruteros/lagos.htm here].</ref>
[[Antillanca ski resort]], less than a hundred kilometers away, is one of the highest-quality resorts in Chile. Ecotourism is also encouraged by the indigenous [[Huilliche]] communities, who inhabit the Pacific coastal zone. Much of the funds brought in by tourism is being used to protect native plant and tree species, most notably the [[Fitzroya|Alerce]], a threatened [[Cupressaceae|Cypress]]. The thick forests open onto a number of beaches and bays, such as Maicolpué, Bahía Mansa and Pucatrihue.

==Sports==
[[Association football|Football]] and [[basketball]] are popular sports in the city. Osorno fields a football team, [[Provincial Osorno]], in the  [[Segunda División de Chile|third level national football league]]. Provincial Osorno plays home games at the [[Estadio Ruben Marcos Peralta]], which has a [[seating capacity]] of 10,000.

Osorno's professional basketball team in the top level [[Liga Nacional de Básquetbol de Chile|National Basketball League]] is called [[:es:CD Español de Osorno|Español de Osorno]]. Their home games are held at the ''Gimnasio María Gallardo'', which has a [[seating capacity]] of almost 4,500.

[[Chilean rodeo]] is popular in Osorno, as it is in most of the center-south zone of the country. Osorno's rodeo stadium, the [[Medialuna de Osorno]], is considered one of the best in the country, and was the qualifying arena for the southern region of the national rodeo in 2006.

[[Boxing]] is also one of the city's pastimes; Osorno produced Chile's boxing representative at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]], [[Martín Vargas]]. Additionally, the mountainous terrain surrounding Osorno is used for [[skiing]] and [[snowboarding]], sports popularized by the large tide of German immigrants. It is the closest city to the [[Antillanca ski resort]], only 98&nbsp;km away.

==Economy==
[[File:Ganaderiaosorno.jpg|thumb|229px|right|Cattle grazing outside Osorno.]]
Osorno is an important [[Agriculture|agricultural]] center, and agriculture makes up the bulk of the Osorno province's economic activity. [[Wheat]] and [[oats]] grow abundantly, but the land is also well-suited to the breeding of [[Chilean horse]]s and [[cattle]]. Some of Chile's finest beef products originate in the Osorno ranches.

Osorno's proximity to the [[Cardenal Antonio Samoré Pass]] makes it a key place the national economy. The [[mountain pass]] connects Osorno to the [[Argentina|Argentine]] city of [[San Carlos de Bariloche|Bariloche]], and is one of primary arteries that ties the two countries' southern regions together. The pass is particularly important due to the fact that it crosses the [[Andes]] mountains at very low altitude, allowing it to remain open even when other passes are blocked by snow.

Despite all this, Osorno has seen some economic stagnation in the past several decades. Agriculture alone has not allowed it to keep pace with the booming, rapidly industrializing Chilean economy; Osorno lacks both industrial and information-services sectors. In one effort to combat this, the city has forged international business ties with several [[Netherlands|Dutch]] companies, after it was discovered that the local climate is ideal for the growing of [[tulip]]s. Likewise, Osorno has recently entered the international meat market. Besides offering high-quality beef, the isolated region is also completely free of the recent rash of cattle plagues such as [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|Mad Cow]] and [[foot-and-mouth disease]], guaranteeing the safety of Chilean meats.

Osorno is now faced with a unique opportunity: the arable land is suited for the growing of beets, soy, and corn, crops rising in popularity with the recent development of [[Biofuel|biocombustibles]]: fuels derived from crops, such as corn-derived [[ethanol]]. It is hoped that the Chilean government's announcement that it will not apply the same steep taxes to agricultural fuels as it does to petroleum products, as well as the increasing demand for more environment-friendly fuels, will mean that Osorno will again become a major economic hub.

As Chile continues to develop as one of South America's economic leaders and one of the most stable states in the region, tourism is on the rise {{tone inline|date=July 2018}}{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}
