Rajahmundry was under Dutch rule for some time. In 1602, the Dutch constructed a fort here. In 1857, the British conquered the Dutch. They converted it into a jail in 1864 and elevated it into a central jail in 1870. The jail is spread over 196 acres (79&nbsp;ha) out of which the buildings occupy 37.24 acres (15.07 ha).

In the Madras Presidency, the District of Rajahmundry was created in 1823.<ref name="Bhaskar"/> It was reorganised in 1859 and was bifurcated into Godavari and Krishna districts. During British rule, Rajahmundry was the headquarters of Godavari district, which was further bifurcated into East Godavari and West Godavari districts in 1925. When the Godavari district was split, [[Kakinada]] became the headquarters of East Godavari and [[Eluru]] became headquarters of West Godavari.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Politics/cMXZqsIvDHpFZMpCNN3uDM/Pensioners-paradise-Kakinada-coming-of-age.html|title=Pensioner's paradise Kakinada coming of age|first=Yogendra|last=Kalavalapalli|date=19 July 2016|website=Mint}}</ref>

Rajahmundry was the hotbed of several movements during India's freedom struggle and acted as a base for many key leaders. When the [[Indian National Congress]] had its first meeting in Bombay (Mumbai), two leaders from Rajahmundry, Nyapathi Subba Rao and Kandukuri Veeresalingam, participated in it. Subba Rao, founder of Hindu Samaj in Rajahmundry, was also one of the six founders of India's noted English daily, ''[[The Hindu]]''.

The Renaissance of Andhra Pradesh started in Rajahmundry. [[Kandukuri Veeresalingam]] is known as the Father of reforms in Andhra Pradesh. He started a monthly magazine Vivekavardhini, and a school for girls at [[Dowleswaram]] in 1874. The first widow remarriage took place on 11 December 1881. A society with 16 members was started on 22 June 1884, which used to look after widow remarriages in Rajahmundry. The town hall was established in 1890 by Veeresalingam. [[Bipin Chandra Pal]] visited Rajahmundry in April 1905 during the Vandemataram Movement. During his visits, he used to address the public in "Pal Chowk" (the present-day Kotipalli Bus Stand). [[Annie Besant]] visited Rajahmundry twice. First, she came during the foundations of a branch of the Divya Gyan Samaj at Alcot Gardens were being laid. She came again during the opening ceremony. Ramakrishna Mission was established in the city during 1950–51 near Kambal tank. The place is now the Ayakar Bhavan.

Rajahmundry is acclaimed as the birthplace of the [[Telugu language]]—its grammar and script evolved from the pen of the city-born poet [[Nannayya]]. Also known as 'Ādi Kavi' (the first poet) of Telugu, Nannayya, along with [[Tikkana]] and [[Yerrana]], translated the [[Sanskrit]] version of [[Mahabharata]] into Telugu. Kandukuri Veeresalingam – a social reformer and the author of Rajashekhara Charithra, the first Telugu novel – was also from Rajahmundry.
