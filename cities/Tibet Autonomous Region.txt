It was formally established in 1965 to replace the [[Tibet Area (administrative division)|Tibet Area]], the former [[Administrative divisions of China|administrative division]] of the PRC established after the [[annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China|annexation of Tibet]]. The establishment was about five years after the [[1959 Tibetan uprising]] and the dismissal of the [[Kashag]], and about 13 years after the original annexation.

The current borders of the Tibet Autonomous Region were generally established in the 18th century<ref>"What is Tibet? – Fact and Fancy", Excerpt from {{cite book |last = Goldstein |first = Melvyn, C. |title = Change, Conflict and Continuity among a Community of Nomadic Pastoralist: A Case Study from Western Tibet, 1950–1990 |year = 1994 |pages = 76–87}}</ref> and include about half of historical Tibet. The Tibet Autonomous Region spans over {{convert|1200000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and is the second-largest [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|province-level division of China]] by area, after [[Xinjiang]]. Due to its harsh and rugged terrain, it is sparsely populated at just over 3.6 million people with a population density of {{convert|3|PD/km2|PD/sqmi}}, and is the least-populous autonomous region or province in China.

== History ==
{{History of Tibet}}
{{Main|History of Tibet}}

[[Yarlung dynasty|Yarlung]] kings founded the [[Tibetan Empire]] in 618. By the end of the 8th century, the empire reached its greatest extent. After a civil war, the empire broke up in 842. The royal lineage [[Era of Fragmentation|fragmented]] and ruled over small kingdoms such as [[Guge]] and [[Maryul]]. The Mongol Empire [[Mongol conquest of Tibet|conquered Tibet]] in 1244 but granted the region a degree of political autonomy. [[Kublai Khan]] later incorporated Tibetans into his [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan empire]] (1271–1368). The [[Sakya (Tibetan Buddhist school)|Sakya]] lama [[Drogön Chögyal Phagpa]] became religious teacher to Kublai in the 1250s, and was made the head of the Tibetan region administration {{circa | 1264}}.

From 1354 to 1642, Central Tibet ([[Ü-Tsang]]) was ruled by a succession of dynasties from [[Nêdong (village)|Nêdong]], [[Shigatse]] and [[Lhasa]]. In 1642, the [[Ganden Phodrang]] court of the [[5th Dalai Lama]] was established by [[Güshi Khan]] of the [[Khoshut Khanate]], who was enthroned as King of Tibet. The Khoshuts ruled until 1717, when they were overthrown by the [[Dzungar Khanate]].

From the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912 until 1950, the [[Tibet (1912–1951)|State of Tibet]] was ''de facto'' independent, as were other regions claimed by the successor [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. The Republican regime, preoccupied with [[Warlord Era|warlordism]] (1916–1928), [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] (1927–1949) and [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invasion]] (1937–1945), did not exert authority in Tibet. Other regions of ethno-cultural Tibet in eastern [[Kham]] and [[Amdo]] had been under ''de jure'' administration of the Chinese dynastic government since the mid-18th century;<ref>Grunfeld, A. Tom, The Making of Modern Tibet, M.E. Sharpe, p. 245.</ref> they form parts of the provinces of [[Qinghai]], [[Gansu]], [[Sichuan]] and [[Yunnan]].

In 1950, following the [[proclamation of the People's Republic of China]] the year before, the [[People's Liberation Army]] entered Tibet and defeated the Tibetan army in [[Battle of Chamdo|a battle]] fought near the city of [[Chamdo]]. In 1951, Tibetan representatives signed the [[Seventeen Point Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet]] with the [[Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China (1949–54)|Central People's Government]] affirming China's [[sovereignty]] over Tibet and the [[annexation of Tibet by the People's Republic of China]]. The [[14th Dalai Lama]] ratified the agreement in October 1951.<ref>Gyatso, Tenzin, Dalai Lama XIV, interview, 25 July 1981.</ref><ref>Goldstein, Melvyn C., ''A History of Modern Tibet, 1913–1951'', University of California Press, 1989, p. 812–813.</ref><ref>A.

== Geography ==
{{Main|Geography of Tibet}}
The Tibet Autonomous Region is located on the [[Tibetan Plateau]], the highest region on Earth. In northern Tibet elevations reach an average of over {{convert|4572|m|ft}}. [[Mount Everest]] is located on Tibet's border with [[Nepal]].

China's provincial-level areas of [[Xinjiang]], [[Qinghai]] and [[Sichuan]] lie to the north, northeast and east, respectively, of the Tibet AR. There is also a short border with [[Yunnan|Yunnan Province]] to the southeast.  The countries to the south and southwest are [[Myanmar]], [[India]], [[Bhutan]], and [[Nepal]]. China claims [[Arunachal Pradesh]] administered by India as part of the Tibet Autonomous Region. It also claims some areas adjoining the Chumbi Valley that are recognised as Bhutan's territory, and some areas of eastern [[Ladakh]] claimed by India. India and China agreed to respect the [[Line of Actual Control]] in a bilateral agreement signed on [[Border Peace and Tranquility Agreement, 1993|7 September 1993]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas {{!}} UN Peacemaker |url=https://peacemaker.un.org/chinaindia-borderagreement93 |access-date=2022-12-01 |website=peacemaker.un.org |language=en}}</ref>{{Primary source inline|date=December 2022}}

[[File:Everest North Face toward Base Camp Tibet Luca Galuzzi 2006 edit 1.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Mount Everest]]]]

Physically, the Tibet AR may be divided into two parts: the lakes region in the west and north-west and the river region, which spreads out on three sides of the former on the east, south and west. Both regions receive limited amounts of rainfall as they lie in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Himalayas]]; however, the region names are useful in contrasting their [[hydrology|hydrological]] structures, and also in contrasting their different cultural uses: [[nomad]]ic in the lake region and [[agriculture|agricultural]] in the river region.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tew.org/geography/t2000.agricultural.html |title = Tibet: Agricultural Regions |access-date = 6 August 2007 |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070824153940/http://www.tew.org/geography/t2000.agricultural.html |archive-date = 24 August 2007 }}</ref> On the south the Tibet AR is bounded by the Himalayas, and on the north by a broad mountain system. The system at no point narrows to a single range; generally there are three or four across its breadth. As a whole the system forms the watershed between rivers flowing to the Indian Ocean — the [[Indus River|Indus]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Salween River|Salween]] and its tributaries — and the streams flowing into the undrained salt lakes to the north.

The lake region extends from the [[Pangong Tso|Pangong Tso Lake]] in [[Ladakh]], [[Lake Rakshastal]], [[Yamdrok Lake]] and [[Lake Manasarovar]] near the source of the [[Indus River]], to the sources of the [[Salween]], the [[Mekong]] and the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]]. Other lakes include [[Dagze Co]], [[Namtso]], and [[Pagsum Co]]. The lake region is a wind-swept Alpine grassland. This region is called the [[Chang Tang]] (Byang sang) or 'Northern Plateau' by the people of Tibet. It is {{convert|1100|km|-1|abbr=on}} broad and covers an area about equal to that of France. Due to its great distance from the ocean it is extremely arid and possesses no river outlet. The mountain ranges are spread out, rounded, disconnected, and separated by relatively flat valleys.

The Tibet AR is dotted over with large and small lakes, generally salt or [[alkaline]], and intersected by streams. Due to the presence of [[discontinuous permafrost]] over the Chang Tang, the soil is boggy and covered with tussocks of grass, thus resembling the Siberian [[tundra]]. Salt and fresh-water lakes are intermingled. The lakes are generally without outlet, or have only a small [[effluent]]. The deposits consist of [[Sodium carbonate|soda]], [[potash]], [[borax]] and common [[salt]]. The lake region is noted for a vast number of [[hot spring]]s, which are widely distributed between the Himalaya and 34° N, but are most numerous to the west of Tengri Nor (north-west of Lhasa). So intense is the cold in this part of Tibet that these springs are sometimes represented by columns of ice, the nearly boiling water having frozen in the act of ejection.

The river region is characterized by fertile mountain valleys and includes the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River (Tibet)|Yarlung Tsangpo River]] (the upper courses of the [[Brahmaputra]]) and its major tributary, the [[Nyang River]], the [[Salween]], the [[Yangtze]], the [[Mekong]], and the [[Yellow River]]. The [[Yarlung Tsangpo Canyon]], formed by a horseshoe bend in the river where it flows around [[Namcha Barwa]], is the deepest and possibly longest canyon in the world.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.china.org.cn/english/MATERIAL/185555.htm |title = The World's Biggest Canyon |publisher = china.org |access-date = 29 June 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012120238/http://china.org.cn/english/MATERIAL/185555.htm |archive-date = 12 October 2007 |url-status = live }}</ref> Among the mountains there are many narrow valleys. The valleys of [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]], [[Xigazê]], [[Gyantse]] and the Brahmaputra are free from permafrost, covered with good soil and groves of trees, well irrigated, and richly cultivated.

The [[South Tibet Valley]] is formed by the Yarlung Tsangpo River during its middle reaches, where it travels from west to east. The valley is approximately {{convert|1200|km|-1|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|300|km|-1|abbr=on}} wide. The valley descends from {{convert|4500|m|-1|abbr=on}} above sea level to {{convert|2800|m|-1|abbr=on}}. The mountains on either side of the valley are usually around {{convert|5000|m|-1|abbr=on}} high.<ref>{{cite book |title = Tibetan Geography |pages = 30–31 |publisher = China Intercontinental Press |isbn = 978-7-5085-0665-4 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4q_XoMACOxkC&q=%22South+Tibet+Valley%22&pg=PA30 |last1 = Yang |first1 = Qinye |last2 = Zheng |first2=Du |year=2004}}</ref><ref>Zheng Du, Zhang Qingsong, Wu Shaohong: ''Mountain Geoecology and Sustainable Development of the Tibetan Plateau'' (Kluwer 2000), {{ISBN|0-7923-6688-3}}, p. 312;</ref> Lakes here include [[Lake Paiku]] and [[Lake Puma Yumco]].

The Tibet Autonomous Region is a province-level entity of the People's Republic of China. Chinese law nominally guarantees some autonomy in the areas of education and language policy. Like other subdivisions of China, routine administration is carried out by a [[People's Government of Tibet Autonomous Region|People's Government]], headed by a chairman, who has been an ethnic Tibetan except for an interregnum during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. As with other Chinese provinces, the chairman carries out work under the direction of the regional secretary of the [[Chinese Communist Party]]. The standing committee of the [[Tibet Autonomous Regional Committee of the Chinese Communist Party|regional Communist Party Committee]] serves as the top rung of political power in the region. The current chairman is [[Yan Jinhai]] and the current party secretary is [[Wang Junzheng]].

Historically, the population of Tibet consisted of primarily ethnic [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]].

According to the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] published between 1910 and 1911, the total population of the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, including the lamas in the city and vicinity, was about 30,000, and the permanent population also included Chinese families (about 2,000).<ref>{{Cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lhasa |volume=16 |page=531 |first1=Henry |last1=Yule |authorlink1=Henry Yule  |first2=Laurence |last2=Waddell |authorlink2=Laurence Waddell }}</ref>

The main religion in Tibet has been [[Buddhism]] since its outspread in the 8th century AD. Before the arrival of Buddhism, the main religion among Tibetans was an indigenous [[shamanism|shamanic]] and [[animism|animistic]] religion, [[Bon]], which now comprises a sizeable minority and influenced the formation of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].

According to estimates from the International Religious Freedom Report of 2012, most Tibetans (who comprise 91% of the population of the Tibet Autonomous Region) are adherents of Tibetan Buddhism, while a minority of 400,000 people are followers the native Bon or folk religions which share the image of [[Confucius]] ([[Tibetic languages|Tibetan]]: ''Kongtse Trulgyi Gyalpo'') with [[Chinese folk religion]], though in a different light.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Te-Ming TSENG |author2=Shen-Yu LIN |url=http://www.eastasia.ntu.edu.tw/chinese/data/4-2/4-2-7/4-2-7.pdf |trans-title=The Image of Confucius in Tibetan Culture |script-title=zh:《臺灣東亞文明研究學刊》第4卷第2期（總第8期） |date=December 2007 |pages=169–207 |website=[[National Taiwan University]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304104518/http://www.eastasia.ntu.edu.tw/chinese/data/4-2/4-2-7/4-2-7.pdf |archive-date=4 March 2016  }}</ref><ref>Shenyu Lin.

The added value of the service sector accounted for 54.1 percent and contributed a 57.6 percent share to economic growth.
