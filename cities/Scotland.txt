The mainland of Scotland is broadly divided into three regions: the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], a mountainous region in the north and north-west; the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]], a flatter plain across the centre of the country; and the [[Southern Uplands]], a hilly region along the southern border. The Highlands are the most mountainous region of the British Isles and contain its highest peak, [[Ben Nevis]], at {{Convert|1345|m|ft|order=flip}}.<ref name="ONS Geography Guide" /> The region also contains many lakes, called [[loch]]s; the term is also applied to the many saltwater inlets along the country's deeply indented western coastline. The geography of the many islands is varied. Some, such as [[Isle of Mull|Mull]] and [[Isle of Skye|Skye]], are noted for their mountainous terrain, while the likes of [[Tiree]] and [[Coll]] are much flatter.{{TOC limit|3}}

[[Prehistoric Scotland]], before the arrival of the [[Roman Empire]], was culturally divergent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Prehistoric Scotland was culturally divergent before the Romans arrived |url=https://www.heritagedaily.com/2021/12/prehistoric-scotland-was-culturally-divergent-before-the-romans-arrived/142216 |website=www.heritagedaily.com |date=10 December 2021 |publisher=Hertitage Daily |access-date=11 January 2024 |archive-date=11 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240111203704/https://www.heritagedaily.com/2021/12/prehistoric-scotland-was-culturally-divergent-before-the-romans-arrived/142216 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Repeated glaciations, which covered the entire land mass of modern Scotland, destroyed any traces of [[human habitation]] that may have existed before the [[Mesolithic period]]. It is believed the first post-glacial groups of [[hunter-gatherer]]s arrived in Scotland around 12,800 years ago, as the ice sheet retreated after the [[Last glacial period|last glaciation]].<ref>The earliest known evidence is a flint arrowhead from [[Islay]]. See Moffat, Alistair (2005) ''Before Scotland: The Story of Scotland Before History''. London. Thames & Hudson.

[[Neolithic]] habitation, burial, and ritual sites are particularly common and well preserved in the [[Northern Isles]] and [[Western Isles]], where a lack of trees led to most structures being built of local stone.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Pryor |first=Francis |title=Britain BC |publisher=HarperPerennial |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-00-712693-4 |location=London |pages=98–104 & 246–250 |author-link=Francis Pryor}}</ref> Evidence of sophisticated pre-Christian belief systems is demonstrated by sites such as the [[Callanish Stones]] on [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]] and the [[Maes Howe]] on [[Orkney]], which were built in the third millennium BC.<ref name="short" />{{Rp|38}}

The first written reference to Scotland was in 320 BC by Greek sailor [[Pytheas]], who called the northern tip of Britain "Orcas", the source of the name of the Orkney islands.<ref name="Forsyth"/>{{Rp|10}}

Most of modern Scotland was not [[Roman conquest of Britain|incorporated]] into the [[Roman Empire]], and Roman control over parts of the area fluctuated over a rather short period.

The whole of Scotland was covered by ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice ages]] and the landscape is much affected by glaciation. From a geological perspective, the country has three main sub-divisions: the Highlands and Islands, the Central Lowlands, and the Southern Uplands.

The [[Highlands and Islands]] lie to the north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], which runs from [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] to [[Stonehaven]]. This part of Scotland largely comprises ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Precambrian]], which were uplifted during the later [[Caledonian orogeny]]. It is interspersed with [[igneous]] intrusions of a more recent age, remnants of which formed mountain massifs such as the [[Cairngorms]] and [[Skye]] [[Cuillins]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hebrides – Scottish Geology Trust |url=https://www.scottishgeologytrust.org/geology/scotlands-geology/regional-geology/hebrides/ |access-date=25 January 2024 |language=en-GB |archive-date=25 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240125153024/https://www.scottishgeologytrust.org/geology/scotlands-geology/regional-geology/hebrides/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In north-eastern mainland Scotland [[weathering]] of rock that occurred before the [[Last Glacial Period|Last Ice Age]] has shaped much of the landscape.<ref name="Hall1986">{{Cite journal |last=Hall |first=Adian M. |year=1986 |title=Deep weathering patterns in north-east Scotland and their geomorphological significance |journal=[[Zeitschrift für Geomorphologie]] |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=407–422 |doi=10.1127/zfg/30/1987/407|issn = 0372-8854}}</ref>

A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstone]]s found principally along the [[Moray Firth]] coast. The [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: [[Shetland]], [[Orkney]], and the [[Inner Hebrides]] and [[Outer Hebrides]]. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including [[Loch Lomond]] and [[Loch Ness]]. Some parts of the coastline consist of [[machair (geography)|machair]], a low-lying dune pasture land.

The [[Central Lowlands]] is a [[rift valley]] mainly comprising [[Paleozoic]] formations. Many of these sediments have economic significance for it is here that the coal and iron-bearing rocks that fuelled Scotland's [[industrial revolution]] are found. This area has also experienced intense volcanism, [[Arthur's Seat]] in Edinburgh being the remnant of a once much larger volcano. This area is relatively low-lying, although even here hills such as the [[Ochil Hills|Ochils]] and [[Campsie Fells]] are rarely far from view.

The [[Southern Uplands]] is a range of hills almost {{Convert|200|km|mi|round=5|order=flip}} long, interspersed with broad valleys. They lie south of a second [[fault (geology)|fault line]] (the Southern Uplands fault) that runs from [[Girvan]] to [[Dunbar]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 November 1990 |title=Southern Uplands |url=http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041128062644/http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0029160.html |archive-date=28 November 2004 |access-date=11 June 2009 |publisher=Tiscali.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Education Scotland – Standard Grade Bitesize Revision – Ask a Teacher – Geography – Physical – Question From PN |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/standard/other/sos/geography/physical/answerphysical_59.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202071454/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/education/bitesize/standard/other/sos/geography/physical/answerphysical_59.shtml |archive-date=2 December 2010 |access-date=11 June 2009 |publisher=BBC}}</ref><ref name="Scotland Today » ITKT">{{Cite web |date=28 December 2006 |title=Scotland Today " ITKT |url=http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106204251/http://www.intheknowtraveler.com/1144 |archive-date=6 January 2007 |access-date=11 June 2009 |publisher=Intheknowtraveler.com}}</ref> The geological foundations largely comprise [[Silurian]] deposits laid down some 400 to 500&nbsp;million years ago.

[[File:Traigh Bail, Tiree - geograph.org.uk - 7983.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tiree]] in the [[Inner Hebrides]] is one of the sunniest locations in Scotland.]]
The climate of most of Scotland is [[temperate]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]], and tends to be very changeable. As it is warmed by the [[Gulf Stream]] from the Atlantic, it has much milder winters (but cooler, wetter summers) than areas on similar latitudes, such as [[Labrador]], southern [[Scandinavia]], the [[Moscow region]] in [[Russia]], and the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]] on the opposite side of [[Eurasia]]. Temperatures are generally lower than in the rest of the UK, with the temperature of {{Convert|-27.2|°C|°F|1}} recorded at [[Braemar]] in the [[Grampian Mountains]], on 11 February 1895, the coldest ever recorded anywhere in the UK.<ref>{{Cite web |title= UK Records |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/uk_records.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202071307/http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/features/understanding/uk_records.shtml |archive-date=2 December 2010 |access-date=21 September 2007 |publisher=BBC Weather }} The same temperature was also recorded in Braemar on 10 January 1982 and at [[Altnaharra]], [[Highland (council area)|Highland]], on 30 December 1995.</ref> Winter maxima average {{Convert|6|°C|°F|0}} in the Lowlands, with summer maxima averaging {{Convert|18|°C|°F|0}}.

The west of Scotland is usually warmer than the east, owing to the influence of Atlantic [[ocean currents]] and the colder surface temperatures of the [[North Sea]].

These problems, and the desire to improve agriculture and profits were the driving forces of the ongoing [[Highland Clearances]], in which many of the population of the Highlands suffered eviction as lands were enclosed, principally so that they could be used for sheep farming. The first phase of the clearances followed patterns of agricultural change throughout Britain. The second phase was driven by overpopulation, the [[Highland Potato Famine]] and the collapse of industries that had relied on the wartime economy of the Napoleonic Wars.<ref>E.

Scots law provides for three types of [[Courts of Scotland|courts]] responsible for the administration of justice: civil, criminal and [[Law of Arms|heraldic]]. The supreme civil court is the [[Court of Session]], although civil [[appeal (law)|appeals]] can be taken to the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (or before 1 October 2009, the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]]). The [[High Court of Justiciary]] is the supreme criminal court in Scotland. The Court of Session is housed at [[Parliament House, Edinburgh|Parliament House]], in Edinburgh, which was the home of the pre-Union [[Parliament of Scotland]] with the High Court of Justiciary and the Supreme Court of Appeal currently located at the [[Lawnmarket]]. The [[sheriff court]] is the main criminal and civil court, hearing most cases. There are 49 sheriff courts throughout the country.<ref>[http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/locations/index.asp "Court Information"] www.scotcourts.gov.uk.

{{Main|Culture of Scotland|Music of Scotland|}}
[[File:Edinburgh Scottish bagpiper (49552292312).jpg|thumb|right|The [[Bagpipes]] are an instrument largely associated with Scotland, and an early example of popular Scottish music]]

[[Scottish music]] is a significant aspect of the nation's culture, with both traditional and modern influences. A famous traditional Scottish instrument is the [[Great Highland bagpipe]], a woodwind reed instrument consisting of three drones and a melody pipe (called the chanter), which are fed continuously by a reservoir of air in a bag. The popularity of [[pipe band]]s—primarily featuring bagpipes, various types of snares and drums, and showcasing Scottish traditional dress and music—has spread throughout the world. Bagpipes are featured in holiday celebrations, parades, funerals, weddings, and other events internationally. Many military regiments have a pipe band of their own. In addition to the Great Highland pipes, several smaller, somewhat quieter [[bellows]]-blown varieties of bagpipe are played in Scotland, including the [[Scottish smallpipes|smallpipes]] and the [[Border pipes]].

[[Music of Scotland#Pop, rock and fusion|Scottish popular music]] has gained an international following, with artists such as [[Lewis Capaldi]], [[Amy Macdonald]], [[KT Tunstall]], [[Nina Nesbitt]], [[Chvrches]], [[Gerry Cinnamon]] and [[Paolo Nutini]] gaining international success.

Scottish cuisine has distinctive attributes and recipes of its own but shares much with wider [[British cuisine|British]] and [[European cuisine]] as a result of local and foreign influences, both ancient and modern. Traditional Scottish dishes exist alongside international foodstuffs brought about by migration. Scotland's natural larder of [[Game (food)|game]], dairy products, fish, fruit, and vegetables is the chief factor in traditional Scots cooking, with a high reliance on simplicity and a lack of [[spice]]s from abroad, as these were historically rare and expensive.<ref>{{cite web |title=Edinburgh's Pantry: Tatties, neeps, oranges and lemons |url=https://www.nts.org.uk/stories/edinburghs-pantry-tatties-neeps-oranges-and-lemons |website=www.nts.org.uk |publisher=National Trust for Scotland |access-date=7 January 2024}}</ref>
