'''Baja California'''{{#tag:ref|This state is often informally referred to as {{lang|es|Baja California Norte}} (literally "Lower California North" in English) or {{lang|es|Baja Norte}}, to distinguish it from both the [[Baja California peninsula]] as a whole, of which it forms the northern half, and [[Baja California Sur]], the adjacent state that covers the southern half of the peninsula. While ''Baja Norte'' and ''Baja California Norte'' are well-established terms for the northern half of the Baja California peninsula, they do not officially exist as political designations for any state or region.  The latter name (''Baja California Norte'') was officially adopted from 1974 to 1979,<ref>''Lands and Peoples: North America'' (Volume 5 of ''Lands and Peoples'', [[Grolier]], 2005), p. 390.</ref> and endured unofficially thereafter.<ref>"[https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2021/04/23/baja-california-embraces-new-branding-to-boost-tourism-during-pandemic-recovery/ Baja California Embraces New Branding to Boost Tourism During Pandemic Recovery] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220906212629/https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2021/04/23/baja-california-embraces-new-branding-to-boost-tourism-during-pandemic-recovery/ |date=6 September 2022 }}", ''[[Times of San Diego]]'' (23 Apr 2021).</ref>  In other words, "The northern state is officially known as Baja California, but since that name is easily confused with the name for the entire peninsula, it is commonly referred to by visitors and locals alike as Baja Norte."<ref>Jones, Fred and Jones, Gloria. ''Baja Camping: The Complete Guide'', p. 6 ([[Perseus Books Group|Avalon Travel Publishing]], 1994).</ref>|group="note"}} ({{IPA|es|ˈbaxa kaliˈfoɾnja|-|BajaCalifornia.ogg}}; 'Lower California'), officially '''Estado Libre y Soberano de Baja California''' ({{langx|en|Free and Sovereign State of Baja California}}), is a state in [[Mexico]]. It is the northwesternmost of the [[Political divisions of Mexico|32 federal entities]] of Mexico. Before becoming a state in 1952, the area was known as the North Territory of Baja California ({{lang|es|Territorio Norte de Baja California}}). It has an area of {{convert|70113|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} (3.57% of the land mass of Mexico) and comprises the northern half of the [[Baja California peninsula]], north of the [[28th parallel north|28th parallel]], plus oceanic [[Guadalupe Island]]. The mainland portion of the state is bordered on the west by the [[Pacific Ocean]]; on the east by [[Sonora]], the U.S. state of [[Arizona]], and the [[Gulf of California]]; on the north by the U.S. state of [[California]]; and on the south by [[Baja California Sur]].

The state has an estimated population of 3,769,020 as of 2020,<ref name="collapse-Indicadores"/> significantly higher than the sparsely populated Baja California Sur to the south, and similar to [[San Diego County, California]], to its north. Over 75% of the population lives in [[Mexicali]] (the state's capital city), [[Ensenada, Baja California|Ensenada]], or [[Tijuana]] (the state's largest city). Other important cities include [[San Felipe, Baja California|San Felipe]], [[Rosarito]], and [[Tecate]].

Baja California is the 12th-largest state by area in Mexico. Its geography ranges from beaches to forests and deserts. The backbone of the state is the Sierra de Baja California, where [[Picacho del Diablo]], the highest point of the peninsula, is located. This mountain range effectively divides the weather patterns in the state. In the northwest, the weather is semi-dry and [[Mediterranean (climate)|Mediterranean]]. In the narrow center, the weather changes to be more humid due to altitude. It is in this area where a few valleys can be found, such as the [[Valle de Guadalupe]], the major wine-producing area in Mexico. To the east of the mountain range, the [[Sonoran Desert]] dominates the landscape. In the south, the weather becomes drier and gives way to the [[Vizcaíno Desert]]. The state is also home to numerous islands off both of its shores. Baja California is also home to [[Guadalupe Island]], the westernmost point of Mexico. The [[Coronado Islands]], [[Isla Todos Santos|Todos Santos islands]], and [[Cedros Island]] are also on the Pacific shore. On the Gulf of California, the largest island is [[Angel de la Guarda Island]], separated from the peninsula by the deep and narrow [[Canal de Ballenas]].

==History==
===Prehistory and Spanish colonial era===
The first people came to the peninsula at least 11,000 years ago. At that time, two main native groups are thought to have been present on the peninsula – the [[Cochimí]] in the south, and several groups belonging to the [[Yuman language family]] in the north, including the [[Kiliwa people|Kiliwa]], [[Paipai people|Paipai]], [[Kumeyaay]], [[Cocopa]], and [[Quechan]]. These peoples were diverse in their adaptations to the region. The Cochimí of the peninsula's Central Desert were generalized hunter-gatherers who moved frequently; however, the Cochimí on Cedros Island off the west coast developed a strong maritime economy. The Kiliwa, Paipai, and Kumeyaay in the better-watered northwest were also hunter-gatherers, but that region supported denser populations and a more sedentary lifestyle. The Cocopa and Quechan of northeastern Baja California practiced agriculture in the floodplain of the lower [[Colorado River]].

Another group of people was the Guachimis, who came from the north and created much of the [[UNESCO World Heritage]]-recognized [[Sierra de Guadalupe cave paintings]]. Not much is known about them except that they lived in the area between 100{{nbsp}}BC and 1300{{nbsp}}AD.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/714|title=Rock Paintings of the Sierra de San Francisco|website=[[World Heritage List]]|publisher=[[UNESCO World Heritage]] Convention|access-date=12 June 2015|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150628232659/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/714/|archive-date=2015-06-28}}</ref>

Europeans reached the present state of Baja California in 1539, when [[Francisco de Ulloa]] [[wikt:reconnoitered|reconnoitered]] its east coast on the Gulf of California and explored the peninsula's west coast at least as far north as Cedros Island. [[Hernando de Alarcón]] returned to the east coast and ascended the lower Colorado River in 1540, and [[Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo]] (or João Rodrigues Cabrilho {{in lang|pt}}) completed the reconnaissance of the west coast in 1542. [[Sebastián Vizcaíno]] again surveyed the west coast in 1602, but outside visitors during the following century were few.

The [[Jesuits]] founded a permanent mission colony on the peninsula at [[Loreto, Baja California Sur|Loreto]] in 1697. During the following decades, they gradually extended their sway throughout the present state of Baja California Sur. In 1751–1753, the Croatian Jesuit mission-explorer [[Ferdinand Konščak]] made overland explorations northward into the state of Baja California. Jesuit missions were subsequently established among the Cochimí at [[Misión Santa Gertrudis|Santa Gertrudis]] (1752), [[Misión San Francisco Borja|San Borja]] (1762), and [[Misión Santa María de los Ángeles|Santa María]] (1767).

After the [[expulsion of the Jesuits]] in 1768, the short-lived [[Franciscan]] administration (1768–1773) resulted in one new mission at [[Misión San Fernando Rey de España de Velicatá|San Fernando Velicatá]]. More importantly, the 1769 expedition to settle Alta California under [[Gaspar de Portolà]] and [[Junípero Serra]] resulted in the first overland exploration of the northwestern portion of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Riverside-County-California/107384/24|title=History of Riverside County, California|website=Mocavo|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316032333/http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Riverside-County-California/107384/24|archive-date=2016-03-16}}</ref>

The [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] took over management of the Baja California missions from the Franciscans in 1773. They established a chain of new missions among the northern Cochimí and western Yumans, first on the coast and subsequently inland, extending from [[Misión Nuestra Señora del Santísimo Rosario de Viñacado|El Rosario]] (1774) to [[Misión El Descanso|Descanso]] (1817), just south of Tijuana below the [[Palóu Line]].

In 1804, the Spanish crown divided California into [[Alta California|Alta ('Upper')]] and [[Baja California Peninsula|Baja ('Lower') California]] at the line separating the [[Franciscan]] missions in the north from the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missions in the south.
The colonial governors were José Joaquín de Arillaga (1804–1805), [[Felipe de Goicoechea]] (1806–1814),
and [[José Darío Argüello]] (1814{{snd}}April 11, 1822).

===Post-independence, 1821–present===
====Early republic====
[[Liberalism in Mexico|Mexican liberals]] were concerned that the [[Roman Catholic Church]] retained too much power in the post-independence period and sought to undermine it by mandating the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularization of missions]] in 1833. In the aftermath of the [[Mexican American War]] (1846–1848) and the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], the United States gained sovereignty over territory previously held first by [[New Spain]] and then Mexico, most of which was sparsely settled. Alta California was incorporated into the U.S., and during the [[California Gold Rush]], quickly gained enough population to be admitted to the union as a state. Baja California gains control of where is now the cities of [[Tijuana]], [[Mexicali]], and [[Tecate]] from Alta California after the treaty and remained under Mexican control. In 1853, soldier of fortune ([[mercenary]]) [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] captured [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]], declaring himself president of the [[Republic of Baja California]]. The Mexican government forced his retreat after several months.

====Era of Porfirio Díaz====
When liberal army general [[Porfirio Díaz]] came to power in 1876, he embarked on a major program to develop and modernize Mexico.

*1884: Luis Huller and [[George H. Sisson]] obtain a concession covering much of the present state in return for promises to develop the area.<ref>{{cite journal|last=de Novelo|first=Maria Eugenia Bonifaz|title=Ensenada: Its background, founding and early development|journal=[[The Journal of San Diego History]]|publisher=[[San Diego Historical Society]]|year=1984|issue=Winter|volume=30|url=http://www.sandiegohistory.org/journal/84winter/ensenada.htm|access-date=20 July 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820112906/http://sandiegohistory.org/journal/84winter/ensenada.htm|archive-date=20 August 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>
*1905: The ''[[Magonista]]'' revolution, an [[anarchist]] movement based on the writings of [[Ricardo Flores Magón]] and [[Enrique Flores Magón]], begins.
*1911: Mexicali and Tijuana are captured by the [[Mexican Liberal Party]] ({{lang|es|Partido Liberal Mexicano}}, PLM), but soon surrender to Federal forces.

====Postrevolutionary Mexico====
*1917: On 11 December, "[a] prominent Mexican, close friend of President [[Venustiano Carranza|Carranza]]" offered to [[U.S. Senator]] [[Henry F. Ashurst|Henry Ashurst]] to sell Baja California to the U.S. for "fifty million dollars gold".<ref>{{cite book|last=Ashurst|first=Henry Fountain|editor-last=Sparks|editor-first=George F.|title=A Many-Colored Toga: The Diary of Henry Fountain Ashurst|location=Tucson, AZ|publisher=[[The University of Arizona Press]]|year=1962|page=74}}</ref>
*1931: Baja California is further divided into Northern and Southern territories.
*1952: The ''North Territory of Baja California'' becomes the 29th state of [[Mexico]], Baja California. The southern portion (below 28°N) remains a federally administered territory.
*1974: The ''South Territory of Baja California'' becomes the 31st state, Baja California Sur.
*1989: [[Ernesto Ruffo Appel]] of the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] (PAN) becomes the first non-[[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] governor of Baja California and the first opposition governor of any state since the [[Mexican Revolution|Revolution]].

==Geography==

Baja California encompasses a territory within [[the Californias]] region of North America, which exhibits diverse geography for a relatively small area. The [[Peninsular ranges]] of the California cordillera run down the geographic center of the state. The most notable ranges of these mountains are the [[Sierra de Juárez]] and the [[Sierra de San Pedro Mártir]]. These ranges are the location of forests reminiscent of [[Southern California]]'s [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. Picacho del Diablo is the highest peak on the peninsula. Valleys between the mountain ranges are located within a climate zone that is suitable for agriculture. Such valleys include the Valle de Guadalupe and the Valle de Ojos Negros, areas that produce citrus fruits and grapes. The mineral-rich mountain range extends southwards to the Gulf of California, where the western slope becomes wider, forming the Llanos del Berrendo on the border with Baja California Sur. The mountain ranges located in the center and southern part of the state include the [[Sierra de La Asamblea]], Sierra de Calamajué, Sierra de San Luis and the [[Sierra de San Borja]].

Temperate winds from the Pacific Ocean and the cold [[California Current]] make the climate along the northwestern coast pleasant year-round.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://smn.cna.gob.mx/productos/normales/estacion/bc/NORMAL02011.TXT|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625074430/http://smn.cna.gob.mx/productos/normales/estacion/bc/NORMAL02011.TXT|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 June 2007|title=Normales Climatológicas 1971–2000|publisher=[[Servicio Meteorológico Nacional (Mexico)|Servicio Meteorológico Nacional]]|date=25 June 2007|format=TXT}}</ref> As a result of the state's location on the California Current, rains from the north barely reach the peninsula, thus leaving southern areas drier. South of the [[El Rosario, Baja California|El Rosario]] River, the state changes from a Mediterranean landscape to a desert one. This desert exhibits diverse [[succulent]] species that flourish in part due to the [[coastal fog]].

To the east, the Sonoran Desert enters the state from both California and Sonora. Some of the highest temperatures in Mexico are recorded in or nearby the Mexicali Valley.<ref group=note>Delta in the northeast recorded {{convert|54.0|C|F}} on 3 August 1998.</ref> However, with irrigation from the Colorado River, this area has become a true [[Mexicali#The building of an agricultural empire|agricultural center]]. The [[Cerro Prieto]] geothermal province is near Mexicali as well (this area is geologically part of a large [[pull apart basin]]); it produces about 80% of the electricity consumed in the state and enough additional power to export to California. [[Laguna Salada (Baja California)|Laguna Salada]], a saline lake below sea level lying between the rugged Sierra de Juárez and the Sierra de los Cucapah, is also in the vicinity of Mexicali. The state government has recently been considering plans to revive Laguna Salada.<ref group=note>The state is currently (2008) looking at a plan by [[SDSU]] Adj. Professor Newcomb (ICATS){{Explain|reason=What does "ICATS" stand for?|date=September 2020}} to do this using his geothermal desalination system to supply water locally. [[SEMARNAT]] believes this to be the first viable plan presented.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}</ref> The highest mountain in the Sierra de los Cucapah is Cerro del Centinela or [[Mount Signal]]. The Cucapah are the primary indigenous people from the mountains north to [[Yuma, Arizona]].

[[File:Ensenada Grande.jpg|thumb|right|[[Isla Partida]], part of the [[San Lorenzo Marine Archipelago National Park]]]]
There are numerous islands on the Pacific shore. Guadalupe Island is located in the extreme west of the state's boundaries and is the site of large colonies of [[sea lion]]s. Cedros Island exists in the southwest of the state's maritime region. The Todos Santos islands and Coronado Islands are located off the coasts of Ensenada and Tijuana, respectively. All of the islands in the Gulf of California on the Baja California side belong to the municipality of Mexicali.

Baja California obtains much of its water from the Colorado River. Historically, the river drained into the [[Colorado River Delta]] and then flowed into the Gulf of California, but due to large demands for water in the [[American Southwest]], less water now reaches the Gulf. The [[Tijuana metropolitan area]] also relies on the [[Tijuana River]] as a source of water. Much of rural Baja California depends predominantly on wells, a few dams and even oases. Tijuana also purchases water from San Diego County's Otay Water District. Potable water is the largest natural resource issue of the state.

===Climate===
[[File:Carignan vineyard.jpg|thumb|left|Vineyard in the [[Valle de Guadalupe]]]]
Baja California's climate varies from [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] to [[arid climate|arid]]. The Mediterranean climate is found in the northwestern corner of the state, where the summers are dry and mild and the winters cool and rainy. This climate is observed in areas from Tijuana to [[San Quintín, Baja California|San Quintín]] and nearby interior valleys. The cold oceanic California Current often creates a low-level marine fog near the coast. The fog occurs along any part of the Pacific coast of the state.<!-- (I'm commenting this out because the numbers are missing. If you can fill those in, optimally with a source, please reinstate. Thanks!) Rainfall in the Tijuana to Ensenada area is about ? per year, increasing inland with elevation. Tecate, in the mountains east of Tijuana, receives ? of precipitation per year. -->

[[File:Paisaje con nieve.jpg|thumb|Snowfall at [[Constitution 1857 National Park]]]]
The change of altitude towards the Sierra de Baja California creates an [[alpine climate]] in this region. Summers are cool, while winters can be cold with below freezing temperatures at night. It is common to see snow in the Sierra de Juárez, Sierra de San Pedro Mártir and in the valleys in between the two ranges from December to April. Due to [[orographic]] effects, precipitation is much higher in the mountains of northern Baja California than on the western coastal plain or eastern desert plain.<!-- (I'm commenting this out because the numbers are missing. If you can fill those in, optimally with a source, please reinstate. Thanks!) The highest slopes receive up to ? of rainfall per year, during winter frontal passages and summer thunderstorms. --> Pine, cedar and fir forests are found in the mountains.

The east side of the mountains produces a [[rain shadow]], creating an extremely arid environment. The Sonoran Desert region of Baja California experiences hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters. The Mexicali Valley (which is below sea level) experiences the highest temperatures in Mexico, frequently surpassing {{convert|47|C|F|1}} in mid-summer, and exceeding {{convert|50|C|F}} on some occasions.

Further south along the Pacific coast, the Mediterranean climate transitions into a desert climate, but it is milder and not as hot as along the gulf coast. Transition climates, from Mediterranean to desert, can be found from San Quintín to [[El Rosario, Baja California|El Rosario]]. Further inland and along the Gulf of California, the vegetation is scarce and temperatures are very high during the summer months. The islands in the Gulf of California also have a desert climate. Some oases can be found in the desert where few towns are located – for instance, [[Catavina]], San Borja and Santa Gertrudis.{{Which|date=September 2020}}<ref name="Martínez-Ballesté">{{cite journal|last1=Martínez-Ballesté|first1=Andrea|last2=Ezcurra|first2=Exequiel|title=Reconstruction of past climatic events using oxygen isotopes in Washingtonia robusta growing in three anthropic oases in Baja California Sur|journal=Boletín de la Sociedad Geológica Mexicana|year=2018|volume=70|number=1|pages=79–94|doi=10.18268/BSGM2018v70n1a5|doi-access=free}}</ref>

In the main wildlife refuges on the peninsula of Baja California, [[Constitution 1857 National Park]] and [[Sierra de San Pedro Mártir National Park]], several coniferous species can be found. The most abundant are Jeffrey pine, ''[[Pinus ponderosa]]'', ''[[Pinus cembroides]]'', ''[[Pinus quadrifolia]]'', ''[[Pinus monophylla]]'', ''[[Juniperus]]'', [[Arctostaphylos pringlei|''Arctostaphylos pringlei'' subsp. ''drupacea'']], ''[[Artemisia ludoviciana]]'' and ''[[Adenostoma sparsifolium]]''. Baja California shares many plant species with the [[Laguna Mountains]] and [[San Jacinto Mountains]] in southwest California. The lower elevations of the Sierra de Juárez are characterized by [[chaparral]] and [[desert shrub]]. [[Guadalupe Island]] and its surrounding waters, {{convert|250|km|mile}} off the Pacific coast, has been designated the [[Guadalupe Island Biosphere Reserve]] to preserve endangered marine and terrestrial species of animals and plants. 

The fauna in the parks include a large number of mammals, primarily [[mule deer]], [[bighorn sheep]], [[cougar]]s, [[bobcat]]s, [[ringtail cat]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[squirrel]]s and more than 30 species of [[bat]]s. The park is also home to many avian species like [[bald eagle]]s, [[golden eagle]]s, [[falcon]]s, [[woodpecker]]s, [[black vulture]]s, [[crow]]s, and several species of [[Sittidae]] and [[duck]].

===State elections===
[[File:Marina del Pilar.jpg|thumb|[[Marina del Pilar Ávila Olmeda]], the [[governor of Baja California]] since 2021]]
In Baja California, state elections are held every two years (every three years prior to 2019) for the positions of [[Governor of Baja California|state governor]], 25 state deputies of the [[Congress of Baja California]], and 5 municipal mayors. Of the 25 state deputies, 17 are elected by relative majority in each of the electoral districts, while another 8 are elected by proportional representation. The 17 deputies elected by relative majority may be re-elected for up to four consecutive terms, while the other 8 deputies can only serve one term.

During the 2019 Baja California state election, [[Jaime Bonilla Valdez]] of the [[Morena (political party)|Morena]]-led [[Juntos Hacemos Historia]] coalition won by a margin of 27.58% to become the governor of Baja California. In addition, 21 out of 25 state deputy positions and all 5 municipal mayoral positions were won by candidates aligned with the Juntos Hacemos Historia coalition.

During the 2021 Baja California state election, [[Marina del Pilar Ávila Olmeda]] of the Morena-led [[Juntos Hacemos Historia]] coalition won by a margin of 17.49% to become the first female governor of Baja California. Of the state's 25 local deputies, 13 were won by Morena-aligned candidates, followed in a distant second place by candidates of the [[Solidarity Encounter Party]] (PES), [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] (PAN), and [[Labor Party (Mexico)|Labor Party]] (PT) with 3 seats each. All 5 municipal mayoral positions were again won by Morena-aligned candidates.

The next state elections are scheduled for [[2023 Baja California state election|2023]].

Although the state is more European in ancestry, it has historically seen sizable East and Southeast Asian immigrant population. Mexicali has a large Chinese community, as well as many [[Filipinos]] who arrived to the state during the eras of Spanish Philippines and American rule (1898–1946) in much of the 19th and 20th centuries. Tijuana and Ensenada were major ports of entry for East Asians entering the U.S. ever since the first [[Asian American]]s were present in California.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

According to the 2020 Census, 1.71% of Baja California's population identified as Black, [[Afro-Mexican]], or of African descent.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/ccpv/2020/tableros/panorama/|title=Panorama|access-date=6 October 2021|archive-date=26 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126013823/https://www.inegi.org.mx/programas/ccpv/2020/tableros/panorama/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since 1960, large numbers of migrants from southern Mexican states have arrived to work in agriculture (especially the Mexicali Valley and nearby [[Imperial Valley]], California, U.S.) and manufacturing. The cities of Ensenada, Tijuana, and Mexicali grew as a result of migrants, primarily those who sought U.S. citizenship. Those temporary residents awaiting their entry into the United States are called {{lang|es|flotillas}}, which is derived from the Spanish word {{lang|es|flota}}, meaning 'fleet'.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

There is also a sizable immigrant community from Central and South America, and from the United States and Canada. An estimated 200,000+ American [[expatriates]] live in the state, especially in [[seaside resort|coastal resort]] towns such as Ensenada, known for affordable homes purchased by retirees who continue to hold U.S. citizenship. San Felipe, Rosarito and Tijuana also have a large American population (second largest in Mexico after Mexico City), particularly for their cheaper housing and proximity to San Diego.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}}

Some 60,000 Oaxacans live in Baja California. Some 40% of them lack proper birth certificates.<ref>{{cite web|last=López|first=Citlalli|url=http://www.noticiasnet.mx/portal/oaxaca/general/migrantes/127126-problemas-acta-nacimiento-40-oaxaquenos-baja-california|title=Con problemas en acta de nacimiento 40% de oaxaqueños en Baja California|trans-title=40% of Oaxacans in Baja California have problems with birth certificates|language=es|website=Noticiasnet|date=28 November 2012|access-date=2014-05-24|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525235340/http://www.noticiasnet.mx/portal/general/migrantes/127126-con-problemas-en-acta-de-nacimiento-40-de-oaxaque%C3%B1os-en-baja-california|archive-date=2014-05-25}}</ref>

According to a [[Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (Mexico)|Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología]] (Conacyt) investigator, a little under a million people were classified as "poor" in the state, up from 2008 when there were roughly 810,000. Exactly who these people are, whether locals, interstate or international migrants, was not explained.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldetijuana/notas/n4303592.htm|last=Galván|first=Rocío|title=Aumentó pobreza en BC, de 2008 al 2014|trans-title=Poverty increased in BC, from 2008 to 2014|language=es|publisher=[[Organización Editorial Mexicana]]|website=El Sol de Tijuana|date=15 October 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018163502/http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldetijuana/notas/n4303592.htm|archive-date=2016-10-18}}</ref>

==Education==
{{Further|:Category:Universities and colleges in Baja California}}
Baja California offers one of the best educational programs in the country, with high rankings in schooling and achievement.

The state government provides education and qualification courses to increase the workforce standards, such as school–enterprise linkage programs which help the development of a labor force according to the needs of the industry.

91.60% of the population from six to fourteen years of age attend elementary school. 61.95% of the population over fifteen years of age attends or has already graduated from high school. Public school is available in all levels from kindergarten to university.

The state has 32 universities offering 103 professional degrees. These universities have 19 research and development centers for basic and applied investigation in advanced projects related to biotechnology, physics, oceanography, computer science, digital [[Geothermal power|geothermal]] technology, astronomy, aerospace, electrical engineering and clean energy, among others. At this educational level, supply is steadily growing. Baja California has developed a need to be self-sufficient in matters of technological and scientific innovation and to be less dependent on foreign countries. Current businesses demand new production processes as well as technology for the incubation of companies. The number of graduate degrees offered, including PhD programs, is 121. The state has 53 graduate schools.<ref name=GOBC>{{cite web|url=http://www.investinbaja.gob.mx/english/workforce/education.htm|title=Education System|year=2014|website=Invest in Baja|publisher=Secretariat of Economic Development|location=Mexicali, Baja California|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011124241/http://www.investinbaja.gob.mx/english/workforce/education.htm|archive-date=2014-10-11}}</ref>
