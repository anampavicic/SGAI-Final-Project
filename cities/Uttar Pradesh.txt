Uttar Pradesh was established in 1950 after India had become a republic. It is a successor to the [[United Provinces (1937–1950)|United Provinces]], established in 1935 by renaming the [[United Provinces of Agra and Oudh]], in turn established in 1902 from the [[North-Western Provinces]] and the [[List of Chief Commissioners of Oudh|Oudh Province]]. Though long known for sugar production, the state's economy is now dominated by the services industry. The service sector comprises travel and [[tourism]], [[hotel industry]], [[real estate]], [[insurance]] and financial consultancies. The [[economy of Uttar Pradesh]] is the [[List of Indian states and union territories by GDP|third-largest state economy]] in India, with {{INRConvert|18.63|lc|lk=on}} in [[gross domestic product]] and a per capita GSDP of {{INRConvert|68810}}.<ref name="UP_budjet" /> The [[Allahabad High Court|High Court]] of the state is located in [[Prayagraj]]. The state contributes 80 seats to the lower house [[Lok Sabha]] and 31 seats and the upper house [[Rajya Sabha]].

On 9 November 2000, a new state, Uttaranchal (now [[Uttarakhand]]), was created from Uttar Pradesh's western Himalayan hill region. The two major rivers of the state, the [[Ganges]] and its tributary [[Yamuna]], meet at the [[Triveni Sangam]] in Prayagraj, a Hindu pilgrimage site. Other notable rivers are [[Gomti River|Gomti]] and [[Sarayu River (Ayodhya)|Saryu]]. The forest cover in the state is 6.1 percent of the state's geographical area. The cultivable area is 82 percent of the total geographical area, and the net area sown is 68.5 percent of the cultivable area.<ref name="Cultivation">{{Cite web |title=Agriculture |url=https://niti.gov.in/planningcommission.gov.in/docs/plans/stateplan/upsdr/vol-2/Chap_b1.pdf |access-date=19 October 2021 |website=niti.gov.in |publisher=[[NITI Aayog]] |archive-date=7 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211007073805/https://niti.gov.in/planningcommission.gov.in/docs/plans/stateplan/upsdr/vol-2/Chap_b1.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Inhabitants of the state are called [[Awadhi people|Awadhi]], [[Braj]]i, or [[Bundelkhand|Bundeli]], depending upon their region of origin. [[Hinduism]] is practised by more than three-fourths of the population, followed by [[Islam]]. [[Hindi]] is the most widely spoken language and is also the official language of the state, along with [[Urdu]]. Uttar Pradesh was home to most of the mainstream political entities that existed in [[Ancient India|ancient]] and [[medieval India]] including the [[Maurya Empire]], [[Harsha Empire]], [[Gupta Empire]], [[Pala Empire]], [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Mughal Empire]] as well as many other empires. At the time of the [[Indian independence movement]] in the early 20th century, there were three major [[princely states]] in Uttar Pradesh – Ramgadi, [[Rampur State|Rampur]] and [[Benares State|Benares]] and served as a focal point for the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 rebellion]] against British rule. The state houses several holy Hindu temples and pilgrimage centres. Along with several historical, natural and religious tourist destinations, including [[Agra]], [[Aligarh]], [[Ayodhya]], [[Bareilly]], [[Gorakhpur]], [[Kanpur]], [[Kushinagar]], [[Lucknow]], [[Mathura]], [[Meerut]], [[Prayagraj]], [[Varanasi]], and [[Vrindavan]], Uttar Pradesh is also home to three [[List of World Heritage Sites in India|World Heritage sites]].

Uttar Pradesh was partially or entirely ruled by the [[Delhi Sultanate]] for 320 years (1206–1526). Five dynasties ruled over the Delhi Sultanate sequentially: the [[Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)|Mamluk dynasty]] (1206–90), the [[Khalji dynasty]] (1290–1320), the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] (1320–1414), the [[Sayyid dynasty]] (1414–51), and the [[Lodi dynasty]] (1451–1526).<ref>* {{Cite book |last=Srivastava |first=Ashirvadi Lal |url=https://archive.org/stream/sultanateofdelhi001929mbp#page/n5/mode/2up |title=The Sultanate of Delhi 711–1526 A D |publisher=Shiva Lal Agarwala & Company |year=1929 |author-link=Ashirbadi Lal Srivastava |access-date=29 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408110410/https://archive.org/stream/sultanateofdelhi001929mbp#page/n5/mode/2up |archive-date=8 April 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Unesco1998">{{Cite book |last1=Islam |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18eABeokpjEC&pg=PA269 |title=History of Civilizations of Central Asia |last2=Bosworth |publisher=UNESCO |year=1998 |isbn=978-9231034671 |pages=269–291 |access-date=21 May 2020 |archive-date=28 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240328162944/https://books.google.com/books?id=18eABeokpjEC&pg=PA269#v=onepage&q&f=false |url-status=live }}</ref>

The first Sultan of Delhi, [[Qutb ud-Din Aibak]], conquered some parts of Uttar Pradesh, including [[Meerut]], [[Aligarh]], and [[Etawah]]. His successor, [[Iltutmish]], expanded the Sultanate's rule over Uttar Pradesh by defeating the King of [[Kannauj]]. During the reign of Sultan [[Balban]], the Mamluk dynasty faced numerous rebellions in the state, but he was able to suppress them and establish his authority. [[Alauddin Khilji]], extended his conquests to various regions in the state, including [[Varanasi]] and [[Prayagraj]]. Apart from the rulers, the Delhi Sultanate era also saw the growth of [[Sufism]] in Uttar Pradesh. Sufi saints, such as [[Nizamuddin Auliya]] and [[Qutbuddin Bakhtiar Kaki]], lived during this period and their teachings had a significant impact on the people of the region. Sultanat era in the state also witnessed the construction of mosques and tombs, including the [[Atala Masjid]] in [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]], the [[Jama Masjid]] in [[Fatehpur Sikri]], and the [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq's Tomb]] in [[Tughlaqabad]].<ref name="Atala">{{cite web | title=Atala Masjid | website=District Jaunpur, Government of Uttar Pradesh | date=20 June 2017 | url=https://jaunpur.nic.in/tourist-place/atala-masjid/ | access-date=6 May 2024}}</ref><ref name="Tughluq Tomb">{{cite web | last=Datta | first=Rangan | title=The tomb of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq | website=Telegraph India | date=22 July 2022 | url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/my-kolkata/places/exploring-the-tomb-of-ghiyasuddin-tughlaq-near-tughlaqabad-fort-in-south-delhi/cid/1875958 | access-date=6 May 2024}}</ref>

The rain in Uttar Pradesh can vary from an annual average of {{Convert|170|cm|in|abbr=in}} in hilly areas to {{Convert|84|cm|in|abbr=in}} in [[Western Uttar Pradesh]].<ref name="Board2008" /> Given the concentration of most of this rainfall in the four months of the monsoon, excess rain can lead to floods and shortage to droughts. As such, these two phenomena, floods and droughts, commonly recur in the state. The climate of the Vindhya Range and [[plateau]] is subtropical with a mean annual rainfall between {{Convert|1000 and 1200|mm|in|abbr=in}}, most of which comes during the monsoon.<ref name="Climate" /> Typical summer months are from March to June, with maximum temperatures ranging from {{convert|30-38|C|F}}. There is a low relative humidity of around 20% and dust-laden winds blow throughout the season. In summer, hot winds called ''[[loo (wind)|loo]]'' blow all across Uttar Pradesh.<ref name="Board2008" />

=== Music and dance ===
{{Main|Music of Uttar Pradesh}}
With each district of Uttar Pradesh having its unique music and tradition, traditional folk music in Uttar Pradesh has been categorised in three different ways including music transmitted orally, music with unknown composers and music performed by custom. During the [[Medieval India|medieval]] period, two distinct types of music began to emerge in Uttar Pradesh. One was the courtly music, which received support from cities like Agra, [[Fatehpur Sikri]], Lucknow, Jaunpur, Varanasi, and [[Banda, Uttar Pradesh|Banda]]. The other was the religious music stemming from the [[Bhakti movement|Bhakti Cult]], which thrived in places like Mathura, Vrindavan, and Ayodhya.<ref name="Hindustani Music">{{cite web | title=Visit the land of the Taj for some Hindustani music & dance | website=The Economic Times | date=10 March 2016 | url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/magazines/travel/visit-the-land-of-the-taj-for-some-hindustani-music-dance/articleshow/51288777.cms?from=mdr | access-date=6 May 2024}}</ref> The popular folk music of Uttar Pradesh includes sohar, which is sung to celebrate the birth of a child.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Cuisine of Uttar Pradesh}}

[[Mughlai cuisine]] is a style of cooking developed in the [[Indian subcontinent]] by the {{linktext|imperial}} kitchens of the [[Mughal Empire]]. It represents the cooking styles used in [[North India]], especially Uttar Pradesh, and has been strongly influenced by [[Central Asian cuisine]]. [[Awadhi cuisine]] from the city of [[Lucknow]] consists of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. It has been greatly influenced by Mughlai cuisine.<ref>{{cite news |title=How is Awadhi Cuisine different from Mughlai Cuisine |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/how-is-awadhi-cuisine-different-from-mughlai-cuisine/photostory/88918225.cms |access-date=22 January 2023 |work=The Times of India |date=16 January 2022 |archive-date=22 January 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230122175602/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/food-news/how-is-awadhi-cuisine-different-from-mughlai-cuisine/photostory/88918225.cms |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Bhojpuri cuisine]] is a style of food preparation common in the districts located near the Bihar border. Bhojpuri foods are mostly mild and tend to be less hot in terms of spices used.
