'''Najafabad''' ({{langx|fa|نجف‌آباد}}; {{IPA|fa|nædʒæfɒːˈbɒːd}}){{efn|Also [[romanize]]d as '''Najafābād'''<ref>{{GEOnet3|6013169}}</ref>}} is a city in the [[Central District (Najafabad County)|Central District]] of [[Najafabad County]], [[Isfahan province|Isfahan]] province, [[Iran]], serving as capital of both the county and the district.<ref name="Isfahan Structure">{{cite web |title = Approval of the organization and chain of citizenship of the elements and units of the national divisions of Isfahan province, centered in the city of Isfahan |language = fa |website = Lamtakam |url = https://lamtakam.com/law/council_of_ministers/113034 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240204010546/https://lamtakam.com/law/council_of_ministers/113034 |publisher = Ministry of Interior, Defense Political Commission of the Government Board |last = Habibi |first = Hassan |archive-date = 4 February 2024 |date = 21 June 1369 |access-date = 4 February 2024}}</ref>

Najafabad is west of [[Isfahan]] and is increasingly becoming a part of the Isfahan Metropolitan area. The city serves as a trade center for agricultural products in the region, and is noted for its [[pomegranate]]s and [[almond]]s. One of the attractions of Najafabad is the "Arg-e Sheykh Bahaie", which has recently been repaired.

==Etymology==
The area of modern day Najafabad was originally called ''Dahan'' ({{langx|fa| دهان}}). However, during the time of the [[Safavid Iran|Safavid]] Shah [[Abbas the Great]], the Shah wanted to send a gift containing jewellery and coins to the [[Imam Ali Shrine|Sanctuary of Imam Ali]] in the city of [[Najaf]], [[Iraq]], and (according to the legend) as the caravan of camels carrying the gift was traveling towards Najaf, it stopped at Dahan near the city of [[Isfahan]] and refused to move. Following this, [[Baha al-Din al-Amili|Shaykh Baha al-Din]] relayed to Shah Abbas, that [[Imam Ali]] himself had manifested to him in a dream and ordered to use the gift to build in the area where the caravan had stopped. The Shah concurred, and thus the city developed and came to be known as ''"Najaf Abad"'' or literally ''"City of Najaf"'' in [[Persian language|Persian]].
