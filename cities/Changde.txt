'''Changde''' ({{zh|c=常德|p=Chángdé|s=常德|t=常德}}; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]:常德區  {{IPAc-cmn|ch|ang|2|.|d|e|2}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in the northwest of [[Hunan]] province, People's Republic of China. In addition to the urban districts, Changde also administers the [[county-level city]] of [[Jinshi City|Jinshi]] and six counties. Changde is adjacent to [[Dongting Lake]] to the east, the city of [[Yiyang]] to the south, [[Wuling Mountains|Wuling]] and [[Xuefeng Mountains]] to the west, and [[Hubei]] province to the north.<ref name="citygov">{{cite web|title=Introduction to Changde|url=http://eng.changde.gov.cn/col/col66150/index.html|work=Changde(China) Official Web Portal- Changde's International Window|publisher=Changde City Government|access-date=7 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213093011/http://eng.changde.gov.cn/col/col66150/index.html|archive-date=13 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The area has been inhabited by humans since around 8,000 years ago. In that time, the city has changed names several times, but it has been known as Changde since the 12th century. The city is well known for the [[Battle of Changde]] during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–45) and the atrocities committed then by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]].

In the past decade, the city has seen a massive construction boom. New highrises have sprung up, roads were rebuilt and new schools, parks and museums have opened. Locals and tourists often visit the Changde Poetry Wall, covered in a variety of poems mostly from ancient China. The wall stretches for {{convert|3|km|mi}} along the [[Yuan River]] downtown and functions as a [[flood wall]]. It is listed in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the longest wall with engraved arts in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Changde Poem Wall|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-06/08/content_337670.htm|publisher=China Daily|access-date=12 December 2013|date=2004-06-08}}</ref>

==History==

===Prehistory===
Changde is known for its many [[Paleolithic]] and [[Neolithic]] sites. About 500 of them have been discovered to date. In 1984 neolithic human settlements were discovered in [[Li County, Hunan|Li County]], part of Changde. In 1988, the [[Pengtoushan]] site was excavated leading to the identification of the "Pengtoushan Culture". The site contains the earliest evidence of a settled village yet discovered in China.<ref name="Higham63">{{cite book|title=The Bronze Age of Southeast Asia|pages=63|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RZ-CV14nXHcC|author=Charles Higham|author-link=Charles Higham (archaeologist)|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=1996|isbn=0-521-56505-7}}</ref> Archeological research from 2011 suggests that a settlement called Shanlonggang, part of the Pengtoushan civilization, may have cultivated rice 8,000-9,000 years ago, making it the possible birthplace of rice cultivation.<ref>{{cite news|title=China's Hunan may be birthplace of cultivated rice|newspaper=People's Daily|date=November 24, 2011|agency=Xinhua News}}</ref>

===Ancient history===
{{expand section|date=December 2013}}
In historical times it was also a centre from which governments controlled the mountain tribes of western Hunan. A county named ''Linyuan'' was established there in the 2nd century BC.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-02-12 |title=中国·常德——桃花源里的城市 |trans-title=China - Changde - The City in the Peach Blossom Garden |url=http://peopledaily.eu/zgxw/20190211_55718.html |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=peopledailynews.eu |language=zh}}</ref>

In the [[Han dynasty]] the area was called "Wuling County". The name is retained in the urban [[Wuling District]]. In the [[Sui dynasty]], it was called Langzhou. During the [[Song dynasty]], it was called Dingcheng. In the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907) it became the seat of Lang prefecture. In 1117, Changde county was established, and around 1165,Changde superior prefecture/[[Fu (administrative division)|fu]] was established. The name Changde has been used for the city ever since.<ref name="citygov" /> This status was retained until 1912, when the superior prefecture was abolished and the city became a county seat.

===19th and early 20th centuries===
In the late 19th century Changde became a prosperous commercial center and the chief agricultural central market of the Yuan River basin. Many Chinese firms, and — after 1905, when it was opened to [[foreign trade]] — foreign firms as well, maintained branches there to buy [[rice]], [[cotton]], [[tung oil]], and [[timber]], so that Changde's economic influence reached out into northern [[Guizhou]], southwestern [[Hubei]], and parts of southeastern [[Sichuan]] province. The merchants of the Taho quarter of the city controlled much of the northwestern Hunan economy, and early in the 20th century Changde was the second city of Hunan, after [[Changsha]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

===Second World War===
[[File:Changde battle.jpg|thumb|240px|Chinese soldiers defending Changde]]
In the 1943 [[Battle of Changde]], the [[Kuomintang]]'s [[National Revolutionary Army]] attempted to stop the invading [[Imperial Japanese Army]] from completing their [[Sichuan invasion|invasion of Sichuan]]. Frustrated, the Japanese side employed [[Changde chemical weapon attack|chemical weapons]] to clear their way.<ref name="autogenerated1">Agar, Jon ''Science in the 20th Century and Beyond'', p.281</ref> During the [[Khabarovsk War Crime Trials]], proof was presented of operations to contaminate the area with [[Bubonic plague|plague]] as early as 1941 and 1942.<ref>Daniel Barenblatt, ''A Plague upon Humanity.'', 2004, pages 220–221.</ref>

===People's Republic===
Although the commercial dominance of Changde firms disappeared with the advent of [[Communist Party of China|communist]] rule in 1949, the city remained an important center of trade, with the majority of its population engaged either in [[commerce]] or in [[transportation]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 1975, Changde was hit by [[Typhoon Nina (1975)|Typhoon Nina]].<ref>Monsoons Over China by Ding Yihui, Springer 1994 edition (December 31, 1993), page 229.</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Fishermen on the Yuan river in Changde.jpg|thumb|Two fishermen on the Yuan river in downtown Changde. The bridge and Jiangnan district can be seen in the background.]]
Located on the [[Yuan River]] upstream from its junction with the [[Lake Dongting]] system, Changde is a natural center of the northwest Hunan plain. The city was historically situated on the north bank of the Yuan River, and has since expanded development south of the river. The Chinese phrase "{{lang|zh|三山三水}}" (literally "Three mountains and three rivers") is often used in reference to the general physical geography of the city. Around the city are three nearby mountains- Taiyang Mountain ({{lang|zh-hans|太阳山}}) to the north, Mount De ({{lang|zh-hans|德山}}) to the south, and Mount Hefu ({{lang|zh-hans|河洑山}}) in the west. In addition to the Yuan River, the city has plentiful water resources with the Chuanzi and Xin Rivers both flowing through Wuling urban district. The other major geographic feature of the area is [[Liuye Lake]] ({{lang|zh-hans|柳叶湖}}), to the northeast of the city center. There are also numerous lakes, ponds, and streams in the city although many have been diverted or buried.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reinventing Waterscape Urbanism: Changde, China|url=http://www.bgr.bund.de/EN/Themen/Wasser/Veranstaltungen/symp_sanitat-gwprotect/poster_stokman_pdf.pdf|publisher=Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources|access-date=11 December 2013|location=Hannover|date=5 August 2008}}</ref>

The larger prefecture-level city of Changde is adjacent to [[Dongting Lake]] to the east, the city of [[Yiyang]] to the south, [[Wuling Mountains|Wuling]] and [[Xuefeng Mountains]] to the west, and [[Hubei]] province to the north.<ref name="citygov" /> Near the border with Hubei province in [[Shimen County|Shimen county]] is [[Huping Mountain]] ({{lang|zh-hans|壶瓶山}}), the highest peaks in Hunan province with an altitude of {{convert|2099|m|ft}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Mount Huping National Nature Reserve|url=http://enghunan.gov.cn/Tourism/PlacesToGo/PlaceToGoOthers/PTG_Changde/200809/t20080917_308108.htm|publisher=Hunan Provincial People's Government|access-date=19 December 2013|date=2008-09-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220021535/http://enghunan.gov.cn/Tourism/PlacesToGo/PlaceToGoOthers/PTG_Changde/200809/t20080917_308108.htm|archive-date=20 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Xuefeng and Wuling mountains have historically been part of the native habitat of the [[South China tiger]]. This species is critically endangered and believed to be extinct in the wild. In recent years, the Chinese government has worked to identify potential sites for the establishment of a tiger reserve for the reintroduction of captive-born tigers into the wild. Hupingshan-Houhe National Natural Reserve Complex in Shimen county was selected as one of several potential sites.<ref>{{cite web|title=South China Tiger Prey Habitat Suitability Assessment in Hupingshan - Houhe National Nature Reserve Complex, China|url=http://www.colby.edu/environ/courses/ES212/aom10/projects_pdf/ES212_10_08_pdf.pdf|access-date=17 December 2013|author=Yiyuan Qin|author2=Philip Nyhus|date=April 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131217221821/http://www.colby.edu/environ/courses/ES212/aom10/projects_pdf/ES212_10_08_pdf.pdf|archive-date=17 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Climate===
It has a [[monsoon]]-influenced, four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with cool, damp winters, and hot, humid summers. Winter begins relatively dry but not sunny and becomes progressively damper and cloudier; spring brings frequent rain and the highest humidity levels of the year. Summer is comparatively sunny, while autumn is somewhat dry. The monthly 24-hour average temperatures ranges from {{convert|5.0|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|28.9|°C|1}} in July, while the annual mean is {{convert|17.37|°C|1}}. The annual precipitation is about {{convert|1366|mm|0|abbr=on}}. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 22% in February and March to 53% in July, the city receives 1,602 hours of bright sunshine annually.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-05-12 |title=常德自然地理 |url=https://www.changde.gov.cn/lccd/cdgk/zrdl/ |website=www.changde.gov.cn |language=zh}}</ref>

Taoyuan county's Uyghur community is culturally distinct from the Uyghur communities of [[Xinjiang]]. While [[Islam]] plays a central role in Xinjiang Uyghur culture, Islam and religious orthodoxy are much less prominent in Changde Uyghur culture.

In addition, the Changde Uyghurs speak [[Chinese language|Chinese]] instead of [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]]. Those who practice Islam also learn [[Arabic language|Arabic]] for religious purposes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Shih|first=Chih-yu|title=Negotiating Ethnicity in China: Citizenship as a Response to the State|year=2002|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-28372-8|page=129|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=leB_VaMfPjsC&pg=PA129 |access-date=20 December 2013|chapter=Ethnic Religion: The adaptation of Islam}}</ref>

===Local food and beverage===
Drinking [[Lei cha]], a beverage made from tea and other dry ingredients ground together and steeped in boiled water, is popular in Changde, especially in the urban districts of Wuling and Dingcheng and Taoyuan and Hanshou counties. Wuling Lei cha, as the Changde variety is sometimes called, is usually made with sesame, peanut, meng bean, rice, tea and ginger. According to legend, the custom of drinking lei cha began in Changde over two thousand years ago when [[Ma Yuan (Han dynasty)|general Ma Yuan]] and his army passed through Wuling county, where Changde is now located. There was a sudden epidemic in the barracks which they were only able to cure with a home remedy given to Ma Yuan by a mysterious old lady. Lei cha has been popular in the region ever since.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:常德特产·武陵擂茶|url=http://tour.rednet.cn/c/2007/08/28/1303797.htm|script-website=zh:红网综合|access-date=20 December 2013|language=zh-cn|date=2007-08-28|archive-date=2018-10-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181020011746/http://tour.rednet.cn/c/2007/08/28/1303797.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Arts===
In the 17th century, folk music from [[Jiangsu]] and [[Zhejiang]] provinces began influencing the popular music scene in Changde's Yuan and Li river district. A unique style of theatrical folk music called [[Changde Sixian]] ({{lang|zh-hans|常德丝弦}}; lit. "Changde strings") evolved from this combination. It includes short expressive sections of lyrics spoken and sung in turns in Changde dialect by a group of singers accompanied by traditional Chinese stringed instruments such as the [[yangqin]], [[pipa]], [[sanxian]], and [[huqin]]. The traditional repertoire has over 100 songs, most of which are based on history or folklore. After the [[History of the People's Republic of China (1949–76)|founding of the People's Republic]] a modern [[Socialist realism|socialist realist]] repertoire emerged. Changde Sixian has been revitalized since the 1980s with several songs receiving national awards. The style has also attracted some international attention since a visiting performance by a Changde Sixian troupe to Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:常德丝弦介绍|url=http://www.hnqyg.com/a/ms/yichanminglu/guojiaji/2008/1219/276.html|publisher=湖南省非物质文化遗产保护中心|access-date=18 December 2013|language=zh-hans|date=2008-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219002534/http://www.hnqyg.com/a/ms/yichanminglu/guojiaji/2008/1219/276.html|archive-date=19 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> In 2006, the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China|State Council]] included Changde Sixian in its first national [[intangible cultural heritage]] list.<ref>{{cite web|script-title=zh:国务院关于公布第一批国家级 非物质文化遗产名录的通知|url=http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2006-06/02/content_297946.htm|publisher=Government of the People's Republic of China |access-date=18 December 2013| language = zh-hans|date=2006-05-20}}</ref>
