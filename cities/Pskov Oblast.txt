'''Pskov Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Пско́вская о́бласть|Pskovskaya oblast'}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]), located in the west of the country. Its [[administrative center]] is the [[Classification of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Pskov]]. As of the [[Russian Census (2021)|2021 Census]], its population was&nbsp;599,084.<ref name="2021Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2021Census}}</ref>

==Geography==
Pskov Oblast is the westernmost [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of contiguous Russia ([[Kaliningrad Oblast]], while located further to the west, is an [[enclave and exclave|exclave]]).<ref name="Zayats">1september.ru. Д. В. Заяц (D. V. Zayats). "[http://geo.1september.ru/article.php?ID=200602302 Псковская область]" (''Pskov Oblast'').</ref> It borders with [[Leningrad Oblast]] in the north, [[Novgorod Oblast]] in the east, [[Tver Oblast|Tver]] and [[Smolensk Oblast]]s in the southeast, [[Vitebsk Region|Vitebsk Oblast]] of [[Belarus]] in the south, and with the [[counties of Latvia]] ([[Alūksne Municipality]], [[Balvi Municipality]], and [[Ludza Municipality]]) and [[Estonia]] ([[Võru County]]) in the west. In the northwest, Pskov Oblast is limited by [[Lake Peipus]], which makes up most of the [[Estonia–Russia border|state border with Estonia]].<ref name="Zayats" />

The oblast is located in the [[Baltic Sea]] [[drainage basin]], mostly in the basin of the [[Narva River]]. The biggest river of this basin is the [[Velikaya River|Velikaya]], which flows across the whole oblast from south to north and drains into Lake Peipus. The drainage basin of the Velikaya covers the whole territory of the oblast, with the exception of relatively minor areas in its southern, eastern, and northeastern parts. The rivers in the southeast drain into the [[Lovat River|Lovat]], which has its source in Belarus and crosses Pskov Oblast from south to north, continuing to Novgorod Oblast. 

The Lovat is a major [[tributary]] of [[Lake Ilmen]] and is itself in the [[Neva River]]'s basin. Another tributary of Lake Ilmen is the [[Shelon River]], which flows in the eastern part of the oblast. Finally, minor areas in the south lie in the basin of the [[Daugava River|Western Dvina]]. A short stretch of the Western Dvina makes up the border between Pskov and Tver Oblasts.

The north of the oblast is flat and swampy, whereas the central and the southern parts are formed by glacial landscapes. There are many lakes, especially in the south. The biggest one, after Lake Peipus, is [[Lake Zhizhitskoye]], with an area of {{convert|51.3|km2|sp=us}}. It is located in the southeast of the oblast, in the basin of the Western Dvina.<ref name="Lesnenko">{{cite web |url= http://www.pskovfish.ru/ozera.htm |script-title= ru:Озера Псковской области |last=Лесненко |first=В.К. |author2= В.Н.

Wood is one of the most important natural resources in the oblast, with forests taking up to one-third of the territory. Total wood reserves as of January&nbsp;1, 2005 were estimated to be at {{convert|331,200,000 |m3|cuft|sp=us}}.<ref name="NatRes">Official website of Pskov Oblast.

==History==
[[File:Campaigns of Stefan Batory.svg |thumb|The campaigns in the final period of the Livonian War. The solid line shows the borders of Poland around 1600, with Russia located to the east]]

Pskov was first mentioned in chronicles under the year 903, and several versions of the [[Trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks]] ran through its current territory, along the Velikaya and the Lovat rivers. Until the 1230s, Pskov was a principality; subsequently it was subordinated to [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] and became a republic, one of the two republics in [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]]. In the [[Pskov Republic]], the highest authority was the assembly of citizens. In 1348, the [[Treaty of Bolotovo]] was concluded, recognizing the independence of Pskov. Over time Pskov became dependent on the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] and after 1399 Moscow appointed viceroys to Pskov. Formal independence ended in 1510, when Pskov was occupied by the troops of [[Vasili III of Russia]], the Grand Prince of Moscow.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.culture.pskov.ru/ru/history |script-title= ru:Культура и история Псковской области |last=Аракчеев |first=В.А. |publisher=Администрация Псковской области |language= ru |access-date=5 November 2012}}</ref> Throughout history, Pskov lands were always situated in the west of Russian Lands, and its rulers were almost constantly at war. In 1242 the [[Battle of the Ice]] on Lake Peipus stopped the expansion of the [[Teutonic Knights]] to the east. During the [[Livonian War]], in 1581, the Polish troops laid siege to Pskov. The areas which now constitute the southern part of the oblast changed hands many times, but after the Livonian War, they were made part of Poland and remained as such until the [[First Partition of Poland]] in 1772. The southeastern part of the oblast then became part of the [[Principality of Toropets]] before it was attached to Moscow in the 15th century.

It was subdivided into five provinces, and the current area of Pskov Oblast was split between two of them - [[Pskov Province|Pskov]] and [[Velikiye Luki Province]]s. In 1772, in order to accommodate areas acquired by Russia as a result of the First Partition of Poland, [[Pskov Governorate]] with the seat in Opochka was created.<ref name="arxiv">{{cite web|url=http://derjava.pskov.ru/arch/archhhhh/989/|script-title=ru:Псковской губернии 225 лет|last=Коломыцева|first=Н.В.|publisher=Краеведческий архив Псковской области|language=ru|access-date=5 April 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20121221192806/http://derjava.pskov.ru/arch/archhhhh/989/|archive-date=December 21, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It quickly proved to be unmanageable and was split in 1776 into Pskov and [[Polotsk Governorate]]s.

In the course of 20th century the population of the Pskov oblast declined significantly and its composition changed. In 1926 almost 1.7 million people lived within the modern borders of the oblast, 92% in rural localities. By 1950 the population dropped to little more than one million due to the forced [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union|collectivisation in the 1930s]], losses during the Second World War and internal migration to other areas of the Soviet Union. Further population movements and the general Russian demographic crisis of the 1990s brought the population down to less than 700 thousand. The industrialisation led to the increase of the urban population which reached 50% in 1976.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Кривуля |first1=И. В. |last2=Манаков |first2=А.

==Politics==
[[File:Pskov asv07-2018 various13 House of Soviets.jpg|thumb|Seat of the Pskov Administration and parliament, House of the Soviets.]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: the first secretary of the Pskov CPSU Committee (who in reality had the most authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside the elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Pskov Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Pskov Oblast Assembly of Deputies]] is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

Liya Milushkina, supporter of Alexey Navalny and former head of the regional [[Open Russia]] organisation, and her husband Artyom were convicted for sale of illegal drugs and sentenced to 10.5 and 11 years in prison respectively.

====Legislature====
The [[Pskov Oblast Assembly of Deputies]] exercises legislative power. The first convocation began work on 8 April 1994. Since 2002, it has been elected by the inhabitants of the Oblast according to a mixed system - the region was one of the first to apply such a model.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://informpskov.ru/news/33038.html |title=Открылась «прощальная» сессия Псковского областного Собрания третьего созыва |trans-title=The "farewell" session of the Pskov Oblast Assembly of the third convocation has opened |access-date=2019-11-28 |archive-date=2018-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180418162104/http://informpskov.ru/news/33038.html |url-status=live}}</ref> Since 2007, it has consisted of 44 deputies (22 + 22): one half is elected on [[Party-list proportional representation|party lists]] ([[Proportional representation|proportional system]]), the second - in [[Constituencies of Russia|single-member districts]] ([[Majoritarian representation|majority system]]).

== Transportation ==
The railway connecting [[Bologoye, Tver Oblast|Bologoye]] and Pskov via Dno and Porkhov crosses the district from east to west. It continues to [[Pechory]] and across the border to [[Tartu]], though there is no railway passenger connections between Pskov and Estonia. In Pskov, it crosses another railroad connecting Saint Petersburg with [[Riga]] via Plyussa, Ostrov, and Pytalovo. Gdov is connected by railroad with [[Veymarn]] via [[Slantsy, Leningrad Oblast|Slantsy]]. This is a part of the railway which continued south to Pskov, however, the stretch between Gdov and Pskov was destroyed during World War II and never rebuilt. In the south, the railway connecting [[Moscow]] with Riga crosses the oblast from east to west, passing through Velikiye Luki, Novosokolniki, and Sebezh. Another railway, running in the east of the oblast in the north–south direction, connects Saint Petersburg via Dno and Novosokolniki with Nevel. In Nevel it splits into two railway lines, both running southeast into Belarus: One line to [[Vitebsk]], and another one to [[Grodno]] via [[Polotsk]] and [[Maladzyechna|Molodechno]]. Finally, Velikiye Luki is a terminus of the railway line running northeast to Bologoye.

The road network in the oblast is relatively dense, excluding depopulated swampy areas in the east of the oblast. The two most significant highways are the [[M9 highway (Russia)|M9 highway]] which connects Moscow and Riga and runs in the east–west direction, and the [[M20 highway (Russia)|M20 highway]] which connects Saint Petersburg and [[Kiev]], running from north to south. The two highways cross near Pustoshka. A number of road stretches are toll roads. Ostrov is the northern terminus of the [[European route E262]], which proceeds to [[Kaunas]] via Rēzekne and Daugavpils.

The oblast is served by airports in [[Pskov Airport|Pskov]] and [[Velikiye Luki Airport|Velikiye Luki]]. [[Pskov Airport|Pskov Airport (Kresty)]] serves regular flights to [[Domodedovo International Airport|Moscow Domodedovo]] and [[Pulkovo Airport|Saint Petersburg Pulkovo]].<ref name="pskovavia">[http://pskovavia.ru/airline/passengers/schedule The schedule of Pskovavia flights]. Retrieved 2014-04-20</ref> These flights are operated by [[Pskovavia]], a local airline.

The very lowest part of the Velikaya is navigable.

Pskov, similarly to Novgorod, avoided the [[Mongol invasion of Rus']], and therefore it conserved the best examples of Old Russian architecture. The Christ's Transfiguration Cathedral of [[Mirozhsky Monastery]] in Pskov, built in the 12th century, contains the 12th-century frescoes, which are extremely rare in Russia. The only other [[List of buildings of Pre-Mongol Rus|pre-Mongol building]] in Pskov Oblast is the katholikon of the [[Ivanovsky Monastery, Pskov|Ivanovsky Monastery]] in Pskov, which was constructed in the 1140s and is allegedly the oldest surviving building in the oblast. In Pskov and its immediate surroundings there are several dozens churches built between the end of the 14th and the 17th century. They all have a very simple architecture, painted white from the outside, and most of them have a belfry constructed just on the main church building. Another architecture feature of Pskov is a presence of a large number of the 17th century living houses (''palatas''). Pre-18th century civil architecture is extremely rare in Russia, only a handful of building survived, and Pskov contains several dozens of the best samples of this genre.
[[File:Pscovo-Pechorskii Monastery 1473 - panoramio (3).jpg|thumb|left|Pskov-Caves Monastery]]

Pskov for a considerable part of its history was located at the west border of Russia, and therefore the fortification architecture was particularly useful in the area. The best surviving examples are the [[Pskov Krom|Pskov Kremlin]], the walls and the towers surrounding the historic center of Pskov, the fortress in [[Izborsk]], the [[Pskov-Caves Monastery]] in the town of Pechory, and the fortress in Porkhov.

Pskov Governorate happened to be the location of the family estate of [[Alexander Pushkin]], a Russian poet credited with the creation of contemporary [[Russian language]]. He spent considerable time at the estate, and once was banished there for two years. In Soviet times, the estate and surrounding areas were transformed into the [[Mikhaylovskoye Museum Reserve]] and became a primary tourist attraction. The estate which belonged to the family of the composer [[Modest Mussorgsky]] in Kunyinsky District is also preserved as a museum.
