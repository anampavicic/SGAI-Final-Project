'''Novosibirsk Oblast''' ({{langx|ru|Новосиби́рская о́бласть|Novosibirskaya oblast'}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] of [[Russia]] (an [[oblast]]) located in southwestern [[Siberia]]. Its [[administrative center|administrative]] and economic center is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Novosibirsk]]. As of the [[2021 Russian census|2021 Census]], Novosibirsk Oblast had a population of 2,797,176.

==Geography==

===Overview===
Novosibirsk Oblast is located in the south of the [[West Siberian Plain]], at the foothills of low [[Salair ridge]], between the [[Ob River|Ob]] and [[Irtysh River]]s. The oblast borders [[Omsk Oblast]] in the west, [[Kazakhstan]] ([[Pavlodar Province]]) in the southwest, [[Tomsk Oblast]] in the north, [[Kemerovo Oblast]] in the east, and [[Altai Krai]] in the south. The territory of the oblast extends for more than {{convert|600|km|sp=us}} from west to east, and for over {{convert|400|km|sp=us}} from north to south. The oblast is mainly plain; in the south the steppes prevail; in the north enormous tracts of woodland with great number of marshes prevail. There are many lakes, the largest ones located at the south. The majority of the rivers belong to the [[Ob River|Ob]] [[drainage basin|basin]], many of them falling in dead lakes. Among the main lakes are [[Lake Chany|Chany]], [[Lake Sartlan|Sartlan]], [[Tandovo]] and [[Lake Ubinskoye|Ubinskoye]].

===Natural resources===
As of 2007, the [[oil]] reserves of the region amounted to 204 million tons. In addition, Novosibirsk Oblast had free gas reserves of 600 million cubic meters, solute gas reserves of 5.2 billion cubic meters, and [[gas condensate]] reserves of 121,000 tons. Most of the oil and gas reserves are located in the [[Severny District|Severny]] and [[Kyshtovsky District|Kyshtovsky]] districts.<ref name="allregions_novosibirsk" />

The following metals can be found in the region: [[zirconium dioxide]] (0.7 million tons), [[titanium dioxide]] (2.9 million tons), [[bauxite]] (2,068,000 tons), and tin (588,000 tons). In addition, there are twenty-three fields of alluvial placer gold in the region (nineteen of which were being developed and prospected in 2006) and seven residual soil gold fields suitable for open-cut mining in the southeast.<ref name="allregions_novosibirsk" />

Novosibirsk Oblast has 5.527 million tons of high-quality [[anthracite]], as well as 2.720 million tons of long-flame and [[coking coal]]. Most of these are located in the Iskitim and Toguchin districts. The north part of the region also has [[peat]] fields with estimated reserves of 7.6 billion tons.<ref name="allregions_novosibirsk" />
Prospected mineral water reserves in the region amount to 6,948 cubic meters per day. The popular Karachinskaya mineral water originates from the region.<ref name="allregions_novosibirsk" />

The oblast has 4,531,800 hectares of forests, with 509.88 million cubic meters of timber reserves. Most of the region's forests consist of softwood. Softwood forests cover an area of 3,481,300 hectares, while softwood timber is spread out over 387.96 million cubic meters. [[Coniferous forest]]s - located mostly near the Ob River and the Salair Ridge - cover an area of 1,011,900 hectares with timber reserves of 121.39 million cubic meters. The economic potential of the forests is reduced by the fact that most of them are located in the north of the region, in areas that are difficult to access.<ref name="allregions_novosibirsk" />

===Climate===
Novosibirsk Oblast has a [[continental climate]]. Average temperature is {{convert|-19|C}} in January and {{convert|+19|C}} in July. Annual precipitation is {{convert|300|–|500|mm|sp=us}}.<ref name="allregions_novosibirsk" />

==History==
During the Middle Ages the region was populated by Siberian [[Siberian Tatars|Tatar]] tribes ([[Baraba Tatars|Baraba]] and [[Chats (subgroup)|Chat]]). Being constantly raided by [[Kalmyk people|Kalmyk]] nomads throughout the first centuries of the exploration of Siberia future Novosibirsk Oblast did not attract many Russian colonists, who preferred to settle around more northerly [[Tomsk]]. The first Russian village [[Maslyanino]] was founded in 1644. In 1716, officer Ivan Butkeyev built the Berd fortress that later became the city of [[Berdsk]], the main center of future colonization and development of the region. Like many other parts of Siberia, the Berd lands became a safe haven for political dissents, fugitive serfs and religious sects from all across Russia.

For the most parts of its history, the Novosibirsk Oblast belonged to the Tomsk administration, initially as a part of the Tomsk [[uyezd]] of the [[Tobolsk Governorate]] and later, starting with 1804, the separate [[Tomsk Governorate]]. The turning point in history of the region was the construction of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway|Trans-Siberian]] and the [[Turkestan–Siberia Railway|Turkestan–Siberian]] railways. Founded in 1893, [[Novosibirsk]], then Novonikolayevsk, became a transport hub of sub-regional importance and surpassed other major Siberian cities like [[Omsk]] and [[Tomsk]] in mere decades. In 1920, the capital of the Tomsk Governorate was moved to Novonikolayevsk, in 1921 the Novonikolayevsk Governorate was established. In 1925, most of the Siberian governorates were united as the [[Siberian Krai]] with Novosibirsk as the capital. In 1930, it was split into [[West Siberian Krai|West Siberian]] (Novosibirsk) and East Siberian ([[Irkutsk]]) krais, the former existed until 1937. The Novosibirsk Oblast was finally established on September 28, 1937. [[Kemerovo Oblast|Kemerovo]] and [[Tomsk Oblast|Tomsk]] became separate from it only in 1943–1944.

==Politics==
[[File:Администрация НСО.jpg|thumb|Novosibirsk Oblast Government building]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Novosibirsk CPSU Committee (who in reality had the greatest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually governor were appointed/elected alongside the elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Novosibirsk Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The [[Legislative Assembly of Novosibirsk Oblast]] is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Assembly exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

===Legislature===
