'''Manzanillo''' ({{IPA|es|mansaˈniʝo}}) is a city and seat of [[Manzanillo Municipality, Colima|Manzanillo Municipality]], in the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Mexican state]] of [[Colima]]. The city, located on the [[Pacific Ocean]], contains [[Mexico]]'s busiest [[port]], responsible for handling Pacific cargo for the [[Mexico City]] area. It is the largest-producing municipality for the business sector and [[tourism]] in the small state of Colima.

The city has been referred to as the "[[sailfish]] capital of the world".<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.gomanzanillo.com/history/|title=History of Manzanillo Mexico|first=Webmaster Go|last=Manzanillo|website=www.gomanzanillo.com|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref> Since 1957, it has hosted national and international fishing competitions, such as the Dorsey Tournament.<ref name="visit-manzanillo">[http://www.visitmexico.com/en/Visitmexico/Visi_Manzanillo Manzanillo info at visitmexico.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824205346/http://www.visitmexico.com/en/Visitmexico/Visi_Manzanillo |date=24 August 2011 }}. Ritrieved 5 August 2011.</ref> Manzanillo has developed as a destination for [[international tourism]].

==History==
;16th century
In 1522, [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]], under orders from conquistador [[Hernán Cortés]], dropped anchor in the Bay of Salagua (north of Manzanillo Bay), looking for safe harbors and good shipbuilding sites.<ref name=history/> In the year before he left, Sandoval granted an audience to local Native chieftains in a small cove, which today carries the name Playa de La Audiencia. A great part of his fleet, which left to [[Spanish East Indies|conquer the Philippines]], was constructed in Salagua.<ref name=history/>

[[Manzanillo Bay]] was discovered in 1527 by navigator [[Alvaro de Saavedra]], naming it Santiago de la Buena Esperanza, or "St. James of Good Hope". Manzanillo was the third port created by the Spanish in the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]].<ref name=history/> It became a departure point for important expeditions. Cortés visited the bay twice to protect his galleons from Portuguese pirates. Over the next 300 years, the Pacific Coast's history is filled with accounts of pirates from Portugal, England, France and even Spain assaulting, looting and burning ships for their rich cargos.<ref name=history/>

;19th century
In 1825 the Port of Manzanillo opened, in recently independent Mexico, and so named because of the abundant groves of native [[Manchineel|Manzanilla (''Hippomane mancinella'')]] trees that were used extensively in the early days of shipbuilding.<ref name=history/> Manzanillo was raised to the status of a city on 15 June 1873. The railroad to Colima was completed in 1889.<ref name=history/>

;20th century
In 1908, President [[Porfirio Diaz]] designated Manzanillo as an official port of entry to Mexico.<ref name=history/> It was the state capital of Colima from 20 February to 1 March 1915, while [[Pancho Villa]]'s troops were threatening to capture the [[Colima City|city of Colima]].<ref name=history/>

;21st century

==Description==
In the 2005 census, the city of Manzanillo had a population of 110,728 and in 2010 its municipality had 161,420.<ref>{{cite web

The municipality covers an area of {{convert|1578.4|km2|sqmi|2|abbr=on}}, and includes such outlying communities as [[El Colomo, Colima|El Colomo]], in addition to many smaller communities. Manzanillo is also a beach resort, and is one of many locations to promote themselves as the "sailfish capital" of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.landbigfish.com/articles/default.cfm?ID=1861|title=Sailfish Capital of the World|website=www.landbigfish.com|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref> One way they promote that claim is by hosting a yearly [[sailfish]] fishing tournament. The [[Revillagigedo Islands]], off the west coast of Mexico in the Pacific Ocean, are part of the municipality, but they are directly administered by the federal government.

Manzanillo is a sister city of the U.S. cities of [[Flagstaff, Arizona]]; [[San Pablo, California]]; and [[Saint Paul, Minnesota]].

==Tourism==
[[File:Atardecer Las Hadas.JPG|thumb|left|Bahía de Manzanillo]]
The city is well known internationally for deep-sea fishing and the [[green flash]] phenomenon during sunsets, as well as the warm waters of the ocean. The city is a destination resort and has many hotels and self-contained resorts, particularly built on the De Santiago peninsula which juts out into the Pacific north of the city centre. Also at the north end of Manzanillo bay is the resort Las Hadas ("the fairies"), which is the most famous<!--and luxurious--> of the city's resorts, having been featured in the movie ''[[10 (1979 film)|10]]'' starring [[Bo Derek]] and [[Dudley Moore]]. Beach scenes were filmed on La Audencia Bay, just over the hill from Las Hadas.
Manzanillo is a popular [[cruise ship]] port of call. Many tourists go from their cruise ships on city tours. Excellent swimming, [[snorkeling]], and [[scuba diving]] is found in Santiago Bay, a few miles north of the city where a cargo ship sank in a hurricane in 1959. Other wrecks and reefs plentiful with fish are scattered throughout the bay.<ref name="visit-manzanillo" />
[[SS Golden Gate (1851)|SS ''Golden Gate'']] sank in 1862 in nearby Playa de Oro, which is named after the huge cargo of gold she was carrying.
Optimists still search for gold on the beach.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.manzanillosun.com/the-ship-s-s-golden-gate/ |access-date=2021-09-20 |title=The Ship S.S. Golden Gate
 |last=Marshall |journal=Manzanillo Sun |date=1 January 2017 |first=Suzanne A.}}</ref>

Manzanillo is known as the Sailfish Capital of the World. Since 1957, it has hosted important national and international fishing competitions, such as the Dorsey Tournament, making it a very attractive fishing destination.<ref name="visit-manzanillo" />

Manzanillo consists of two bays with crescent-shaped beaches, each about 4&nbsp;miles in length. Bahía de Manzanillo is closer to downtown and is the older tourist section. Bahía de Santiago, to the west, is the newer and more upscale area. The two are separated by the Santiago Peninsula. Ship channels are located at the southeast end of Bahía de Manzanillo where large [[cruise ship]]s enter the port area. Manzanillo was once the scene of piracy and adventure. By 2011, its peaceful bays and sophisticated tourist and port infrastructure had made it one of the main tourist resorts and trading centers in the west of Mexico.<ref name="manzanillo-info">[http://www.mexico.us/manzanillo.htm Manzanillo info at mexico.us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703165354/http://www.mexico.us/manzanillo.htm |date=3 July 2011 }}. Retrieved 5 August 2011.</ref>

On 6 July 2010, the [[Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico)|Secretariat of Communications and Transportation]] (Secretaría de Comunicaciones y Transportes) opened a specialized dock for cruise ships at the port, which involved an investment of $100 million [[Mexican peso|pesos]] (MXN) in the first stage. A second phase foresees the construction of a shopping centre.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}

==Geography==
===Climate===
Manzanillo has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw''). The dry season, which is from November to May, has low amounts of precipitation, and temperatures tend to be cooler than in the wet season. The average temperature in March, the coolest month, is {{convert|24|C|0}}. The wet season, which runs from June to October, has warmer temperatures, averaging {{convert|28.3|C|0}} in July, and humidity during this time is higher.

In 2012, the port of Manzanillo initiated an ecological project consisting of dredged canals and creating islands in the Lagoon of the Valle de las Garzas, a protected wildlife area. With this work, the port plans to increase the flow into the lagoon, thus increasing the viability of the enhanced ecosystem that includes the planting of 15,000 mangrove trees. Extensive use of [[geotextile tube]]s was included in the channel creation. These geotextile tubes were used to create two parallel breakwaters on either side of the dredged channels.

==Hurricane Patricia==
On Friday, 23 October 2015, Manzanillo was caught in the path of [[Hurricane Patricia]]. A Category 5 on the [[Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale|Saffir Simpson Hurricane wind scale]], it was the most powerful [[cyclone]] ever measured in the [[Western Hemisphere]], with sustained winds speed up to 200&nbsp;mph (320&nbsp;km/h). Hurricane Patricia made [[landfall]] on 23 October at 7:45pm with catastrophic damage. The center of the storm hit just north of Manzanillo, saving the town from the 200&nbsp;mph winds. [[Puerto Vallarta]] was also near the catastrophic damage zone. Wind and high surf created a catastrophic damage zone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/text/refresh/MIATCPEP5+shtml/230238.shtml|title=Post-Tropical Cyclone Selma Public Advisory|website=www.nhc.noaa.gov|access-date=5 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TROPICAL_WEATHER?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2015-10-23-08-12-12 | publisher=Associated Press | title=Mexico braces for strongest hurricane in Western hemisphere | first=Christopher | last=Sherman | date=23 October 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151024151859/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/T/TROPICAL_WEATHER?SITE=AP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT&CTIME=2015-10-23-08-12-12 | archive-date=24 October 2015 }}</ref> Damage totaled at least $283 million.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}
