==History==
{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2022}}
[[File:Piura Plaza de Armas.jpg|left|thumb|Plaza de Armas of Piura]]

=== Pre-columbian era ===
Like most of northern Peru, the territory of Piura has been inhabited by their autochthonous group of natives called ''tallanes'' and ''yungas''. These groups lived without an organization or single leader to rule until the [[Muchik]] culture eventually took control, and the mixture of these evolved into the [[Vicús culture]]. The [[Chimor]], [[Moche culture|Moche]] and [[Wari Empire]] used to occupy the area surrounding the city. Centuries later, Piura came under the rule of [[Tupac Inca Yupanqui]] of the [[Inca Empire]] for at least 40 years before the Spanish arrived.

=== Colonial era ===
Francisco Pizarro came to the area and established it as the third Spanish city in South America, and Spain's first city in Peru.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Narrative_of_the_Proceedings_of_Pedrarias_Davila/Narrative_of_Pascual_de_Andagoya |title=Narrative of the Proceedings of Pedrarias Davila |first=Pascual de |last=Andagoya |publisher=The Hakluyt Society |access-date=21 June 2019 |via=Wikisource}}</ref> He originally went all the way to what is now [[Tumbes, Peru|Tumbes]] but decided it was not a suitable base for his operations. With the arrival of the Spanish in 1532, the current mestizo and creole cultures of Piura were born. This [[mestizo]] culture includes influences from Spanish [[Extremadura]] and [[Andalucia]]; African influence, owing to the arrival of slaves from Madagascar ([[Malagasy people|Malgache]] slaves); [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[coolie]]s who migrated from [[Guangdong|Canton]] to work the rice fields and replace the slaves; and also [[Roma Gypsies]] who came as pirates looking for [[pearls]], or incognito as Spanish horsemen.

The Spanish named the city from the Quechuan word ''pirhua'', meaning "abundance". Nowadays, Piura is known as the "Ciudad del eterno calor" meaning "The city of eternal heat" because it is hot all year round.

=== Independence ===
In 1820, with the incursions of Admirals [[Guillermo Brown]] and Cochrane of the liberating expedition of [[José de San Martín]], the Piuran population enthusiastically joined the liberating cause, and on January 4, 1821, the independence of Piura was proclaimed in the atrium of the temple of San Francisco. The proclamation was an feat led by the heroes José de Lama, Tomás Cortés, Baltazar Taboada, Tomás Diéguez, the Seminario brothers and others. Likewise, the Piura division of 1,000 men contributed victoriously to the independence of Quito, taking part in the Battle of Pichincha, on May 24, 1822.

=== Republican era ===
In 1861, the [[Department of Piura]] was created and Piura became the departments capital. The department consisted other three provinces at the time, [[Piura Province|Piura]], [[Paita Province|Paita]] and [[Ayabaca Province|Ayabaca]].

In the 1860s, the city of Piura became more dynamic with the cultivation of [[Pima cotton]], brought by Don Emilio Hilbck from the state of [[Arizona]] in the [[United States]], which promoted the industrialization and development of the city and the region, and strong immigration. of English, German and Spanish, in that order, and to a lesser extent Italians and Chinese, who brought their customs and also their knowledge of commerce and industry. Many Americans also arrived. They quickly incorporated themselves into the social fabric, forming families with local ladies and inevitably creating new tastes and habits. Even Piura's cuisine was enriched. In agriculture, the use of the steam pump and specialized machinery was introduced, allowing more cropland to be irrigated, expanding the network of canals since the success of Piuran cotton in the international market was a great stimulus for agriculture. New industries appeared such as deep-sea fishing by whaling fleets, mass production and export trade of toquilla straw hats from Catacaos and annexes.
[[File:Miguel Grau1.jpg|thumb|248x248px|Miguel Grau of Piura]]
Peruvian war hero of the [[War of the Pacific]] against [[Chile]], [[Miguel Grau Seminario]] was born in Piura on July 27, 1834. He became a hero during the naval [[Battle of Angamos]]. According to historians and the Peruvian state, since 2011, they have given the official birthplace of Grau not to Piura but to the port of Paita. Miguel Grau is the most renowned and iconic Peruvian naval officer, being known as ''el Caballero de los Mares'' (Spanish for "Gentleman of the Seas").

In the 1980s, Piura and the department again experienced an ascending and thriving commercial, industrial and socioeconomic development, despite having been devastated in the 1983 disaster, as a consequence of the [[El Niño–Southern Oscillation|El Niño phenomenon]], manifested in torrential rains for six months. that affected its industry, commerce and its urban infrastructure. The El Niño phenomenon that occurred from late 1997 to mid-1998 found the city better prepared, although two of its bridges fell and were subsequently replaced. When it seemed that it was going to be a dry season, in February 2017 it began to rain heavily in what later became known as the coastal Niño phenomenon, and in the early hours of March 27, the river overflowed over the center and northern areas. of the city, causing unforeseen damage, affecting health networks and communication routes.

=== Present ===
Piura is experiencing strong development of its commercial sector with the installation of large shopping centers and department stores in no less than five points of the city considered strategic by investors. Furthermore, in recent years the city has expanded considerably with the creation of new developments and human settlements. Likewise, its industrial sector was also developed with the inauguration of the "Piura Futura" industrial estate, northwest of Piura.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Se inauguró en Piura el nuevo parque industrial de la región norte |url=https://www.naiperu.com/articulo/91/Se-inaugur%C3%B3-en-Piura-el-nuevo-parque-industrial-de-la-regi%C3%B3n-norte |access-date=2024-04-16 |website=NAI PERU |language=es}}</ref>

=== Hydrography ===
[[File:PUENTE BOLOGNESI - PIURA.jpg|thumb|Puente Bolognesi crossing the Piura river]]
The hydrography of Piura Department is determined mainly by the amount of rainfall originating in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. This rainfall is itself determined by the meeting of two ocean currents on the southern

coast of the department, around the bay of [[Sechura]]: the cold [[Humboldt current]] at 13-19&nbsp;°C, and the warm El Niño at 21-27&nbsp;°C. These conditions lead to fluctuations in offshore sea temperatures, which are 18-23&nbsp;°C in winter and spring, and 23-27&nbsp;°C in summer and sometimes in autumn.

The mean annual [[humidity]] is 66%. The mean [[atmospheric pressure]] is 1008.5&nbsp;hPa, while winds are mainly from the north at an average speed of 3&nbsp;m/s. Annual rainfall varies between 10 and 200&nbsp;mm at altitudes of 100–500&nbsp;m; between 200 and 800&nbsp;mm at altitudes of 500–1500&nbsp;m; and averages 1,550&nbsp;mm at altitudes above 1500&nbsp;m.

Most of the region is arid, with rainfall concentrated in the high Andean areas, while on the wide plains the main water sources are seasonal rivers flowing from the north: the [[Chira River|Chira]] and the Piura. The southern half of the plain consists of the [[Sechura Desert]], which supports herbaceous vegetation.

The main rivers are the Piura, the Huancabamba and the Chira. The reservoir of [[Poechos]] has been created within the course of the Chira. It has a capacity of 1,000,000,000 cubic metres and irrigates large portions of the coastal region. The river Quiroz, a tributary of the Piura, supplies the huge artificial lake of San Lorenzo. On the Huancabamba, in the mountains, there is a hydroelectric power station supplying energy to the region.
