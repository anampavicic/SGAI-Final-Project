'''Nakhodka''' ({{lang-rus|Нахо́дка|p=nɐˈxotkə}}, means "''finding''") is a [[port]] [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] in [[Primorsky Krai]], Russia, located on the [[Trudny Peninsula]] jutting into the [[Nakhodka Bay]] of the [[Sea of Japan]], about {{convert|85|km|sp=us}} east of [[Vladivostok]] (169 kilometers by car [https://maintransport.ru/distance/vladivostok-nahodka]), the [[administrative center]] of the [[krai]]. Population: {{ru-census|p2010=159,719|p2002=148,826|p1989=160,056}}

==History==

The [[Nakhodka Bay]], around which the city is organized, was first known to the Russians on the corvette ''[[Amerika (corvette)|Amerika]]'', which sought shelter in the bay during a storm in 1859. In honor of this occasion, the ice-free and relatively calm bay was named Nakhodka, which in Russian means "discovery" or "lucky find".

An imperial settlement existed here from 1868 to 1872 but was abandoned following the death of its administrator, [[Karl Harald Felix Furuhjelm|Harald Furuhjelm]]. In the fall of 1870, Otto Wilhelm Lindholm established a [[whaling]] station across the bay from the settlement. In the spring of 1871 he fitted out his [[schooner]] ''Hannah Rice'' and sailed to [[Posyet]], where he caught six [[gray whale]]s.<ref name=Lindholm>Lindholm, O. V., Haes, T. A., & Tyrtoff, D. N. (2008). ''Beyond the frontiers of imperial Russia: From the memoirs of Otto W. Lindholm''. Javea, Spain: A. de Haes OWL Publishing.</ref>

Until the 20th century, the area around the bay remained uninhabited.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} When the Soviet government decided to build a harbor in the area in the 1930s, a number of small settlements were founded, which were merged as a [[urban-type settlement|work settlement]] in the 1940s. On May&nbsp;18, 1950, the settlement, by then with a population of about 28,000 residents, was granted town status.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}}

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the [[subdivisions of Russia#Administrative divisions|framework of administrative divisions]], it is, together with three [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|rural localities]], incorporated as '''Nakhodka [[City of federal subject significance|City Under Krai Jurisdiction]]'''—an administrative unit with the status equal to that of the [[administrative divisions of Primorsky Krai|districts]].<ref name="Ref130">Law #161-KZ</ref> As a [[subdivisions of Russia#Municipal divisions|municipal division]], Nakhodka City Under Krai Jurisdiction is incorporated as '''Nakhodkinsky Urban Okrug'''.<ref name="Ref858">Law #183-KZ</ref>

==Geography==
===Climate===
Nakhodka has one of the mildest climates in Primorsky Krai and in the whole of the Asian part of Russia. Average temperature in January is {{convert|-9.3|C}}; in August (the warmest month), it is {{convert|+20.6|C}}. It is classified as a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] '''Dfb''') due to the vast seasonal differences and is a very cold climate for a coastal location below 43 degrees latitude. The maritime influence is manifested in low [[diurnal temperature variation]] and a vast summer [[seasonal lag]]. Due to the influence of the interior, there is a sharp drop in temperatures between October and November. Half of the year has mean temperatures above {{convert|10|C|F}}, in spite of the warmest month being only moderately warm and the coldest month having quite severe cold, with a very low seasonal lag in winter.

== Economy and infrastructure <span class="anchor" id="Port of Nakhodka"></span><span class="anchor" id="Economy of Nakhodka"></span>==
[[File:Stores in Nakhodka Fishing Port.JPG|thumb|left|Nakhodka Port, September 2010]]

The city's economy, based mostly around a port and port-related activity such as [[fish processing]] and [[canning]], had suffered since 1991 as Vladivostok was opened to foreign activity again. Local industry also took a hit during the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]].

Nakhodka is a transport junction where goods from Japan are transferred from ships in the [[Port of Vostochny]] onto the Russian railway system, including the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] portion of the [[Eurasian Land Bridge]]. [[Vostochny Port (company)|JSC Vostochny Port]], a [[Stevedore|stevedoring]] company, is headquartered in the city.

The [[Port of Kozmino]] has been since 2012 the eastern terminus of the [[Eastern Siberia-Pacific Ocean pipeline]].

==Sports==
[[FC Okean Nakhodka]] was the only professional sport club in the city. It spent the 1992 and 1993 seasons in the [[Russian Premier League]], although the club later folded and was refounded in the amateur leagues. It is also the home town of [[association football]] player [[Viktor Fayzulin]].
