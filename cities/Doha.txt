Doha was founded in the 1820s as an offshoot of [[Al Bidda]]. It was officially declared as the country's capital in 1971, when Qatar gained independence from being a [[History of Qatar#British protectorate .281916.E2.80.931971.29|British protectorate]].<ref name="Encyclopædia Britannica"/> As the commercial capital of Qatar and one of the emergent financial centers in the [[Middle East]], Doha is considered a beta-level global city by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]]. Doha accommodates [[Education City]], an area devoted to research and education, and [[Hamad Medical City]], an administrative area of medical care. It also includes Doha Sports City, or [[Aspire Zone]], an international sports destination that includes [[Khalifa International Stadium]], [[Hamad Aquatic Centre]]; and the [[Aspire Dome]].

The city was host to the first ministerial-level meeting of the [[Doha Development Round]] of [[World Trade Organization]] negotiations. It was also selected as host city of several sporting events, including the [[2006 Asian Games]], the [[2011 Pan Arab Games]], the [[2019 World Beach Games]], the [[FINA World Aquatics Championships]], the [[FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship|FIVB Volleyball Club World Championship]], the [[WTA Finals]] and most of the games at the [[2011 AFC Asian Cup]].

==Etymology==
According to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment of Doha, the name "Doha" originated from the [[Arabic]] term ''dohat'', meaning "roundness"—a reference to the rounded bays surrounding the area's coastline.<ref name="gis">{{cite web|url=http://geoportal.gisqatar.org.qa/qmape/index.html|title=District map|publisher=The Centre for Geographic Information Systems of Qatar|access-date=29 May 2018|archive-date=20 November 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221120195155/http://geoportal.gisqatar.org.qa/qmape/index.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Doha|Al Bidda}}
[[File:Doha, Qatar Astronaut Imagery.JPG|thumb|A satellite view of Doha on the East coast of Qatar. As with most world cities, Doha developed on the waterfront. Established in today's [[Souq Waqif]] area, it spread out gradually in a radial pattern with ring roads.]]

===Establishment of Al Bidda===
The city of Doha was formed seceding from another local settlement known as [[Al Bidda]]. The earliest documented mention of Al Bidda was made in 1681 by the [[Carmelites|Carmelite]] Convent, in an account that chronicles several settlements in Qatar. In the record, the ruler and a fort in the confines of Al Bidda are alluded to.<ref name="origins1">{{cite web|url=https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|title=Historical references to Doha and Bidda before 1850|publisher=The Origins of Doha Project|page=1|access-date=19 May 2015|archive-date=14 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014040358/https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Billecocq|first=Xavier Beguin|title=Le Qatar et les Français: cinq siècles de récits de voyage et de textes d'érudition|publisher=Collection Relations Internationales & Culture|isbn=978-2-915273-00-7|year=2003}}</ref> [[Carsten Niebuhr]], a German explorer who visited the [[Arabian Peninsula]], created one of the first maps to depict the settlement in 1765, in which he labelled it as 'Guttur'.<ref name="origins1"/><ref>{{cite book|ref=Rahman|last=Rahman|first=Habibur|title=The Emergence Of Qatar|publisher=Routledge|year=2006|page=34|isbn=978-0-7103-1213-6}}</ref>

David Seaton, a British [[Political Resident|political resident]] in [[Muscat]], wrote the first English record of Al Bidda in 1801. He refers to the town as 'Bedih' and describes the geography and defensive structures in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/5144073|title=Origins of Doha Season 1 Archive Report|website=Academia|last=Carter|first=Robert|page=11|access-date=13 March 2015|archive-date=7 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407080240/https://www.academia.edu/5144073|url-status=live}}</ref> He stated that the town had recently been settled by the [[Sudan (tribe)|Sudan tribe]] (singular Al-Suwaidi), whom he considered to be [[Piracy|pirates]]. Seaton attempted to bombard the town with his [[warship]], but returned to Muscat upon finding that the waters were too shallow to position his warship within striking distance.<ref name="origins2">{{cite web|url=https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|title=Historical references to Doha and Bidda before 1850|publisher=The Origins of Doha Project|page=2|access-date=19 May 2015|archive-date=14 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014040358/https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Al-Qasimi|first=Sultan Mohammed|title=The journals of David Seton in the Gulf 1800-1809|publisher=[[Exeter University Press]]|year=1995}}</ref>

In 1820, British surveyor R. H. Colebrook, who visited Al Bidda, remarked on the recent depopulation of the town. He wrote:<ref name="origins2"/><ref>H. Rahman (2006), p. 36.</ref>
{{blockquote|Guttur – Or Ul Budee [Al‐Bidda], once a considerable town, is protected by two square Ghurries [forts] near the seashore; but containing no freshwater they are incapable of defense except against sudden incursions of Bedouins, another Ghurry is situated two miles inland and has fresh water with it. This could contain two hundred men. There are remaining at Ul Budee about 250 men, but the original inhabitants, who may be expected to return from Bahrein, will augment them to 900 or 1,000 men, and if the Doasir tribe, who frequent the place as divers, again settle in it, from 600 to 800 men.}}

The same year, an agreement known as the [[General Maritime Treaty of 1820|General Maritime Treaty]] was signed between the [[East India Company]] and the sheikhs of several Persian Gulf settlements (some of which were later known as the [[Trucial Coast]]). It acknowledged [[British Empire|British]] authority in the Persian Gulf and sought to end piracy and the slave trade. Bahrain became a party to the treaty, and it was assumed that Qatar, perceived as a dependency of Bahrain by the British, was also a party to it.<ref name=cs>Toth, Anthony.

===Formation of Doha===
Doha was founded in the vicinity of Al Bidda sometime during the 1820s.<ref name="origins3">{{cite web|url=https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|title=Historical references to Doha and Bidda before 1850|publisher=The Origins of Doha Project|page=4|access-date=19 May 2015|archive-date=14 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014040358/https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> In January 1823, political{{clarify|date=September 2023}} resident John MacLeod visited Al Bidda to meet with the ruler and initial founder of Doha, Buhur bin Jubrun, who was also the chief of the [[Al-Buainain]] tribe.<ref name="origins3"/><ref>H. Rahman (2006), p. 63.</ref> MacLeod noted that Al Bidda was the only substantial trading port in the peninsula during this time. Following the founding of Doha, written records often conflated Al Bidda and Doha due to the extremely close proximity of the two settlements.<ref name="origins3"/> Later that year, Lt. Guy and Lt. Brucks mapped and wrote a description of the two settlements. Despite being mapped as two separate entities, they were referred to under the collective name of Al Bidda in the written description.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|title=Historical references to Doha and Bidda before 1850|publisher=The Origins of Doha Project|page=5|access-date=19 May 2015|archive-date=14 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014040358/https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Brucks|first=G.

In 1828, Mohammed bin Khamis, a prominent member of the Al-Buainain tribe and successor of Buhur bin Jubrun as chief of Al Bidda, was embroiled in controversy. He had murdered a native of [[Bahrain]], prompting the [[House of Khalifa|Al Khalifa]] sheikh to imprison him. In response, the Al-Buainain tribe revolted, provoking the Al Khalifa to destroy the tribe's fort and evict them to [[Fuwayrit]] and [[Ar Ru'ays]]. This incident allowed the Al Khalifa additional jurisdiction over the town.<ref>{{cite book|ref=Zahlan|last=Zahlan|first=Rosemarie Said|title=The creation of Qatar|publisher=Barnes & Noble Books|edition=print|year=1979|page=33|isbn=978-0-06-497965-8}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023575945.0x000096|title='Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.

In November 1839, an outlaw from [[Abu Dhabi]] named Ghuleta took refuge in Al Bidda, evoking a harsh response from the British. A. H. Nott, a [[Royal Navy|British naval]] commander, demanded that Salemin bin Nasir Al-Suwaidi, chief of the Sudan tribe (Suwaidi) in Al Bidda, take Ghuleta into custody and warned him of consequences in the case of non-compliance. Al-Suwaidi obliged the British request in February 1840 and also arrested the pirate [[Jasim bin Jabir]] and his associates. Despite the compliance, the British demanded a fine of 300 German [[Austro-Hungarian krone|krones]] in compensation for the damages incurred by pirates off the coast of Al Bidda; namely for the piracies committed by bin Jabir. In February 1841, British naval squadrons arrived in Al Bidda and ordered Al-Suwaidi to meet the British demand, threatening consequences if he declined. Al-Suwaidi ultimately declined on the basis that he was uninvolved in bin Jabir's actions. On 26 February, the British fired on Al Bidda, striking a fort and several houses. Al-Suwaidi then paid the fine in full following threats of further action by the British.<ref name="origins6">{{cite web|url=https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|title=Historical references to Doha and Bidda before 1850|publisher=The Origins of Doha Project|pages=5–6|access-date=19 May 2015|archive-date=14 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014040358/https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>H.

[[Isa bin Tarif]], a powerful tribal chief from the [[Al Bin Ali]] tribe, moved to Doha in May 1843. He subsequently evicted the ruling Sudan tribe and installed the [[Al-Maadeed]] and Al-Kuwari tribes in positions of power.<ref name="origins4">{{cite web|url=https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|title=Historical references to Doha and Bidda before 1850|publisher=The Origins of Doha Project|page=6|access-date=19 May 2015|archive-date=14 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201014040358/https://originsofdoha.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/a-history-of-doha-and-bidda1.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> Bin Tarif had been loyal to the Al Khalifa, however, shortly after the swearing-in of a new ruler in Bahrain, bin Tarif grew increasingly suspicious of the ruling Al Khalifa and switched his allegiance to the deposed ruler of Bahrain, [[House of Khalifa#List of monarchs of Bahrain of the Al Khalifa family|Abdullah bin Khalifa]], whom he had previously assisted in deposing of.

In 1867, many ships and troops were sent from Bahrain to assault the towns [[Al Wakrah]] and Doha over a series of disputes. [[Abu Dhabi]] joined on Bahrain's behalf due to the perception that Al Wakrah served as a refuge for fugitives from [[Oman]]. Later that year, the combined forces sacked the two Qatari towns with around 2,700 men in what would come to be known as the [[Qatari–Bahraini War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023462215.0x000024|title='A collection of treaties, engagements and sanads relating to India and neighbouring countries [...] Vol XI containing the treaties, & c., relating to Aden and the south western coast of Arabia, the Arab principalities in the Persian Gulf, Muscat (Oman), Baluchistan and the North-West Frontier Province' [113v] (235/822)|date=9 October 2014|publisher=Qatar Digital Library|access-date=12 January 2015|archive-date=16 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716052452/https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023462215.0x000024|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023636219.0x000010|title='File 19/243 IV Zubarah' [8r] (15/322)|date=21 March 2014|publisher=Qatar Digital Library|access-date=12 January 2015|archive-date=16 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190716054015/https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023636219.0x000010|url-status=live}}</ref> A British record later stated that "the towns of Doha and Wakrah were, at the end of 1867 temporarily blotted out of existence, the houses being dismantled and the inhabitants deported".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023575945.0x00009d|title='Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.

The joint Bahraini-Abu Dhabi incursion and subsequent Qatari counterattack prompted the British political agent, Colonel [[Lewis Pelly]], to impose a settlement in 1868. Pelly's mission to Bahrain and Qatar and the peace treaty that resulted were milestones in Qatar's history. It implicitly recognized Qatar as a distinct entity independent from Bahrain and explicitly acknowledged the position of Mohammed bin Thani as an important representative of the peninsula's tribes.<ref>H. Rahman (2006), p. 123.</ref>

In December 1871, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s established a presence in the country with 100 of their troops occupying the Musallam fort in Doha. This was accepted by Mohammad bin Thani's son, [[Jassim bin Mohammed Al Thani|Jassim Al Thani]], who wished to protect Doha from Saudi incursions.<ref>H.

Disagreement over tribute and interference in internal affairs arose, eventually leading to the [[Battle of Al Wajbah]] in March 1893.

====Lorimer report (1908)====
British administrator and historian [[John Gordon Lorimer (1870–1914)|J. G. Lorimer]] authored an extensive handbook for British agents in the Persian Gulf entitled ''[[Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf, Oman and Central Arabia|Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf]]'' in 1908. In it, he gives a comprehensive account of Doha at the time:
[[File:Doha looking northwest 1934 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|"Dohah looking northwest", photographed by the Royal Air Force during a reconnaissance of the Qatar Peninsula on 9 May 1934]]
{{blockquote
|Generally so styled at the present day, but Bedouins sometimes call it Dohat-al-Qatar, and it seems to have been formerly better known as Bida' (''Anglice'' "Bidder"): it is the chief town of Qatar and is situated on the eastern side of that peninsula, about 63 miles south of its extremity at [[Ras Rakan]] and 45 miles north of [[Khawr al Udayd|Khor-al Odaid]] Harbour. Dohah stands on the south side of a deep bay at the south-western corner of a natural harbor which is about 3 miles in extent and is protected on the north-east and south-east sides by natural reefs. The entrance, less than a mile wide, is from the east between the points of the reefs; it is shallow and somewhat difficult, and vessels of more than 15 feet draught cannot pass. The soundings within the basin vary from 3 to 5 fathoms and are regular: the bottom is white mud or clay.

Townsite and quarters, — The south-eastern point of the bay are quite low but the land on the western side is stony desert 40 or 50 feet above the level of the sea. The town is built up the slope of some rising ground between these two extremes and consists of 9 Fanqs or quarters, which are given below in their order from the east to the west and north: the total frontage of the place upon the sea is nearly 2 miles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023515713.0x000089|title='Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.

}}

[[File:OldDistrictDoha.jpg|thumb|An old district in Doha, planned with narrow streets and rough plastered walls, give a glimpse of the city's past.]]
Lorimer goes on to list and describe the districts of Doha, which at the time included the still-existing districts of [[Al Mirqab (Doha)|Al Mirqab]], [[As Salatah]], [[Al Bidda]] and [[Rumeilah (Doha)|Rumeilah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023515713.0x00008a|title='Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.

{{blockquote
|The general appearance of Dohah is unattractive; the lanes are narrow and irregular the houses dingy and small. There are no date palms or other trees, and the only garden is a small one near the fort, kept up by the Turkish garrison.<ref name="gaz540">{{cite web|url=https://www.qdl.qa/en/archive/81055/vdc_100023515713.0x00008d|title='Gazetteer of the Persian Gulf.

}}

As for Doha's population, Lorimer asserts that "the inhabitants of Dohah are estimated to amount, inclusive of the Turkish military garrison of 350 men, to about 12,000 souls". He qualified this statement with a tabulated overview of the various tribes and ethnic groups living in the town.<ref name="gaz540"/>

====British protectorate (1916–1971)====
In April 1913, the Ottomans agreed to a British request that they withdraw all their troops from Qatar. Ottoman presence in the peninsula ceased, when in August 1915, the Ottoman fort in Al Bidda was evacuated shortly after the start of World War I.<ref>M. Althani (2013), p, 134.</ref> One year later, Qatar agreed to be a British [[protectorate]] with Doha as its official capital.<ref>H.

Buildings at the time were simple dwellings of one or two rooms, built from mud, stone, and coral. Oil concessions in the 1920s and 1930s, and subsequent oil drilling in 1939, heralded the beginning of slow economic and social progress in the country. However, revenues were somewhat diminished due to the devaluation of pearl trade in the [[Persian Gulf]] brought on by the introduction of the [[cultured pearl]] and the [[Great Depression]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Pearl Diving in Qatar|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/pearl-diving-qatar-100698.html|newspaper=USA Today|access-date=14 June 2015|archive-date=19 August 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180819214256/https://traveltips.usatoday.com/pearl-diving-qatar-100698.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The collapse of the pearl trade caused a significant population drop throughout the entire country.<ref name="urbanevolution"/> It was not until the 1950s and 1960s that the country saw significant monetary returns from oil drilling.<ref name="cs"/>

Qatar was not long in exploiting the new-found wealth from oil concessions, and slum areas were quickly razed to be replaced by more modern buildings. In 1950, British adviser to the Emir, Phillip L. Plant, initiated several municipal projects. Starting with remodeling the old complex of the [[Old Amiri Palace]], Plant then initiated the construction of a seaside road about a half-mile in length which opened up and made accessible the half dozen [[Jetty|jetties]] along Doha's most built-up section.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/the-political-situation-and-social-problems-in-qatar/mode/2up|title=Transmitting Memorandum by Consul M.R.

The main outcome of the [[World Trade Organization Ministerial Conference of 2013]] was the Trade Facilitation Agreement.  The agreement aims to make it easier and cheaper to import and export by improving customs procedures and making rules more transparent.  Reducing global trade costs by 1% would increase worldwide income by more than US$40 billion, 65% of which would go to developing countries.  The gains from the Trade Facilitation Agreement are expected to be distributed among all countries and regions, with developing landlocked countries benefiting the most.<ref name="WTO"/>

The Trade Facilitation Agreement will enter into force upon its ratification by 2/3 of WTO Members. The EU ratified the agreement in October 2015.<ref name="WTO"/>

Doha is considered as the most important tourist city in Qatar. Qatar's tourism sector is also a key focus of its economic diversification strategy. The country is investing in the development of new tourism infrastructure, such as hotels and resorts, and promoting its cultural attractions, such as the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha|Museum of Islamic Art]] and the [[Katara Cultural Village]] to attract visitors from around the world. In addition, [[Qatar Airways]] has become one of the world's leading airlines, connecting the country to major cities across the globe. Qatar has also been attracting major international events to the country, such as the [[FIFA World Cup 2022]], which is expected to generate significant revenue for the country and boost its tourism sector. High and rising incomes in Qatar offer significant opportunities in culinary establishments and retail sectors. Premium and healthy brands are especially well received. Convenience food is also an increasingly important sector for younger Qataris and visitors.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://group.atradius.com/press/atradius-news/qatar-looks-to-world-cup-business-boost.html |title=Qatar looks to World Cup business boost |access-date=18 November 2023 |archive-date=18 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231118094412/https://group.atradius.com/press/atradius-news/qatar-looks-to-world-cup-business-boost.html |url-status=live }}</ref> In recent years, Qatar has been taking steps to diversify its economy and reduce its reliance on oil and gas revenues. The country has launched several initiatives aimed at promoting non-oil sectors such as tourism, finance, and technology. For example, Qatar has invested heavily in building world-class infrastructure, including the [[Hamad International Airport]] and the Qatar Free Zones Authority, to attract foreign investors and businesses to set up shop in the country.

[[File:Traditional buildings at Katara at night.jpg|thumb|Traditional buildings at Katara Cultural Village]]
In Doha's traditional architecture, the primary building material was locally quarried [[limestone]], with walls typically measuring {{convert|0.4|m}} to {{convert|0.6|m}} thick, constructed using two rows of large facing stones with a core of mud, gravel, and smaller stones. These walls were then covered with clay-rich mud or [[gypsum]]-based render. [[Plaster]], known as ''juss'', was made from crushed [[beachrock]], shell, baked lime, or gypsum, and applied in three layers for both functional and decorative purposes. Roofing was characteristically flat, utilizing [[mangrove]] beams (''danshal'') imported from [[East Africa]], overlaid with split [[bamboo]], woven [[Reed (plant)|reed]], and [[Arecaceae|palm]] mats, then sealed with tamped earth.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Eddisford|first1=Daniel|last2=Carter|first2=Robert|url=https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10023452/1/Carter_Vernacular%20Architecture%20in%20Doha.pdf|title=The Vernacular Architecture of Doha, Qatar|publisher=University College London|pages=14–15|date=26 October 2016|accessdate=25 May 2024}}</ref> Distinctive architectural elements included colonnaded [[veranda]]s ([[liwan]]) with lintels made of mangrove poles bound with [[jute]] rope, and wooden [[waterspout]]s for drainage.

Many of the older structures (1960–1970s) in the Old Doha districts have been demolished to make space for new buildings.<ref name="bouassa"/> A number of schemes have been taken to preserve the city's cultural and architectural heritage, such as the [[Qatar Museums Authority]]'s 'Al Turath al Hai' ('living heritage') initiative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marhaba.qa/the-winners-of-the-old-doha-prize-competition-announced/|title=The Winners of the Old Doha Prize Competition Announced|publisher=Marhaba|date=26 November 2013|access-date=10 July 2015|archive-date=27 September 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180927165027/http://www.marhaba.qa/the-winners-of-the-old-doha-prize-competition-announced/}}</ref> Katara Cultural Village is a model village in Doha launched by [[Moza bint Nasser|Sheikha Moza bint Nasser]] under [[Qatar Foundation]] to preserve the cultural identity of the country.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.katara.net/english/about-katara/about-us/ |title=About us |publisher=Katara |access-date=17 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722071207/http://www.katara.net/english/about-katara/about-us/ |archive-date=22 July 2015 }}</ref>

====Modern architecture====
[[File:Skyscrapers along a road in Al Dafna.jpg|thumb|Doha's [[Al Dafna]] area with the high-rises seen on the waterfront and the villa compounds and other residential areas seen in the background]]
During the mid-20th century, Qatar experienced a transition in its construction methods, marking a shift from traditional building techniques to more modern approaches. In the 1950s, a notable change was the adoption of [[concrete block]]s with shell inclusions. These blocks were likely produced locally and incorporated a distinctive shelly sand rich in small [[gastropod]] remains, a material abundant along Qatar's coastline.<ref name="eddisford13">{{cite web|last1=Eddisford|first1=Daniel|last2=Carter|first2=Robert|url=https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10023452/1/Carter_Vernacular%20Architecture%20in%20Doha.pdf|title=The Vernacular Architecture of Doha, Qatar|publisher=University College London|page=13|date=26 October 2016|accessdate=25 May 2024}}</ref>

As Qatar progressed into the latter half of the 20th century, construction methods continued to evolve. The use of shell-infused concrete blocks gradually gave way to more standardized building materials. This newer phase of construction is characterized by the use of plain concrete blocks without shell content and [[reinforced concrete]] structures. New materials such as manufactured wood products including [[plywood]] and metal materials such as [[corrugated iron]] were also introduced. This period also witnessed the widespread adoption of air conditioning systems.<ref name="eddisford13"/>

In 2014, [[Abdullah bin Hamad Al Attiyah|Abdullah Al Attiyah]], a senior government official, announced that Qatar would be spending $65bn on new infrastructure projects in upcoming years in preparation for the 2022 World Cup as well as progressing towards its objectives set out in the [[Qatar National Vision 2030]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/business/qatar-construction-561913|title=Doha rolling out the dough for Qatar infrastructure, set to launch new projects worth $65 billion|website=Al Bawaba|date=17 March 2014|access-date=17 July 2015|archive-date=28 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150728143735/http://www.albawaba.com/business/qatar-construction-561913|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Atmosphere===
In the pre-modern era, Doha's architectural landscape was characterized by densely clustered dwellings interconnected by narrow passageways, a design that offered mutual shade, privacy, and safety to residents. This urban configuration persisted until the latter part of the 20th century. Traditional building techniques in Doha emphasized climate adaptation. Thick stone walls, often reaching {{convert|0.6|m}} in width, served as effective thermal insulators, mitigating heat transfer to the interior. Facades typically featured minimal [[Fenestration (architecture)|fenestration]] to maintain privacy and regulate internal temperatures. When present, windows were often internal and shuttered, frequently shielded by expansive [[veranda]]s to minimize solar heat gain.<ref name="eddisford7">{{cite web|last1=Eddisford|first1=Daniel|last2=Carter|first2=Robert|url=https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10023452/1/Carter_Vernacular%20Architecture%20in%20Doha.pdf|title=The Vernacular Architecture of Doha, Qatar|publisher=University College London|page=7|date=26 October 2016|accessdate=25 May 2024}}</ref>

The ''badgheer'' system was used to facilitate air circulation for cooling. This encompassed both [[windcatcher]]s and wall vents, with the latter being more prevalent in Doha. Large open [[courtyard]]s were integral to promoting air movement within structures. Design elements such as horizontal apertures at wall bases and within roof screens generated cooling breezes and air circulation. Ornate, perforated [[gypsum]] panels served dual purposes, acting as decorative elements while enhancing airflow within domiciles.<ref name="eddisford7"/>

Due to excessive heat from the sun during the summer, some Doha-based building companies implemented various forms of [[Air conditioning|cooling technology]] to alleviate the extremely torrid climatic conditions in the late 20th century.
