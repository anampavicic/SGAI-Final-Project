'''Ho Chi Minh City''' ('''HCMC'''; {{langx|vi|Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh}}), also known as '''Saigon''' ({{langx|vi|Sài Gòn|labels=no}}), is the most populous city in [[Vietnam]], with a population of around 10 million in 2023.<ref name="2019census"/> The city's geography is defined by rivers and canals, of which the largest is [[Saigon River]]. As a [[Municipalities of Vietnam|municipality]], Ho Chi Minh City consists of 16 [[List of urban districts of Vietnam|urban districts]], five [[Huyện|rural districts]], and one [[Municipal city (Vietnam)|municipal city]] (sub-city).

Since ancient times, [[Maritime transport|water transport]] has been heavily used by inhabitants in the area. The area was occupied by [[Champa]] from 2nd century AD to around the 19th century, due to [[Đại Việt]]'s expansionist policy of ''[[Nam tiến]]''. After the fall of the [[Citadel of Saigon]], the city became the capital of [[French Indochina]] from 1887 to 1902, and again from 1945 until its cessation in 1954. Following the [[1954 Geneva Conference|partition of French Indochina]], it became the capital of [[South Vietnam]] until it was captured by [[North Vietnam]], who renamed the city after their former leader [[Hồ Chí Minh]], though the former name is still widely used in informal usages. Beginning in the 1990s, the city underwent rapid expansion and modernization, which contributed to [[Đổi Mới|Vietnam's post-war economic recovery]] and helped revive its [[international trade]] hub status.

Ho Chi Minh City has a long tradition of being one of the centers of economy, entertainment and education in Vietnam. As such, the city is also the busiest international [[transport hub]] in Vietnam, as [[Tan Son Nhat International Airport|Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport]] accounts for nearly half of all international arrivals to Vietnam<ref>{{cite news |title=Military land approved for new Tan Son Nhat airport terminal |url=https://e.vnexpress.net/news/news/military-land-approved-for-new-tan-son-nhat-airport-terminal-4493489.html |access-date=30 August 2022 |work=VnExpress}}</ref> and the [[Saigon Port|Port of Saigon]] is among the [[List of busiest container ports|busiest container ports in Southeast Asia]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Three Vietnamese seaports among top 100 largest container ports worldwide |url=https://www.gso.gov.vn/en/other-news/2022/11/three-vietnamese-seaports-among-top-100-largest-container-ports-worldwide/ |access-date=27 December 2023 |work=General Statistics Office of Vietnam}}</ref> Ho Chi Minh City is also a tourist attraction. Some of the war and [[List of historic buildings in Ho Chi Minh City|historic landmarks]] in the city include the [[Independence Palace]], [[Landmark 81]] (tallest building in Vietnam), the [[War Remnants Museum]], and [[Bến Thành Market]]. The city is also known for its narrow walkable [[Hem (alleyway)|alleys]] and bustling [[Nightlife|night life]]. Currently, Ho Chi Minh City is facing increasing threats of [[sea level rise]] and [[flood]]ing as well as heavy strains on public infrastructures.

===Saigon===
[[File:SaiGonGiaDinhChuNom.jpg|left|thumb|190px|Saigon is written here as {{lang|zh-Hant|柴棍}} along with other Southern Vietnamese cities. (On the left of the page, first row after "{{lang|zh-Hant|城庯三}}")]]

The original toponym behind Sài Gòn, was attested earliest as {{lang|zh-Hant|柴棍}}, with two phonograms whose Sino-Vietnamese readings are sài and côn respectively, in Lê Quý Đôn's "Miscellaneous Chronicles of the Pacified Frontier" ({{lang|zh-Hant|撫邊雜錄}}, {{lang|vi|Phủ biên tạp lục}} c. 1776), wherein Lê relates that, in 1674, Cambodian prince Ang Nan was installed as uparaja in {{lang|zh-Hant|柴棍}} (Sài Gòn) by Vietnamese forces.

{{lang|zh-Hant|柴棍}} also appears later in Trịnh Hoài Đức's "Comprehensive Records about the Gia Định Citadel" ({{lang|zh-Hant|嘉定城通志}}, {{lang|vi|Gia Định thành thông chí}}, c. 1820), "Textbook on the Geography of the Southern Country" ({{lang|zh-Hant|南國地輿教科書}}, {{lang|vi|Nam quốc địa dư giáo khoa thư}}, 1908),<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=梁 Lương |first=竹潭 Trúc Đàm |date=1908 |title=南國地輿教科書 Nam quốc địa dư giáo khoa thư |url=https://lib.nomfoundation.org/collection/1/volume/1043/ |website=Nom Foundation}}</ref> etc.

===Ho Chi Minh City===
The current official name, ''{{lang|vi|Thành phố Hồ Chí Minh}}'', was first proclaimed in 1945, and later adopted in 1976. It is abbreviated as TP.HCM, and translated in English as ''Ho Chi Minh City'', abbreviated as HCMC, and in French as ''{{lang|fr|Hô-Chi-Minh-Ville}}'' (the [[circumflex]] is sometimes omitted), abbreviated as HCMV. The name commemorates [[Ho Chi Minh]], the first leader of [[North Vietnam]]. This name, though not his given name, was one he favored throughout his later years. It combines a common Vietnamese surname ({{lang|vi|Hồ|italics=no}}, {{vi-nom|[[:wiktionary:胡|胡]]}}) with a given name meaning "enlightened will" (from [[Sino-Vietnamese vocabulary|Sino-Vietnamese]], [[wiktionary:志|志]] [[wiktionary:明|明]]; {{lang|vi|Chí|italics=no}} meaning 'will' or 'spirit', and {{lang|vi|Minh|italics=no}} meaning 'light'), in essence, meaning "light bringer".<ref name="bbc-bacho2">{{cite web |title=Historic Figures: Hồ Chí Minh (1890–1969) |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/ho_chi_minh.shtml |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122111037/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/historic_figures/ho_chi_minh.shtml |archive-date=22 January 2010 |access-date=1 June 2010 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref> Nowadays, "Saigon" is still used as a semi-official name for the city, in some cases being used interchangeably with Ho Chi Minh City, partly due to its long history and familiarity.

The first [[Vietnamese people]] crossed the sea to explore this land completely without the organisation of the [[Nguyễn Lords]]. Thanks to the marriage between Princess [[Nguyễn Phúc Ngọc Vạn]] - daughter of Lord [[Nguyễn Phúc Nguyên]] - and the King of Cambodia [[Chey Chettha II]] in 1620, the relationship between Vietnam and Cambodia became smooth, and the people of the two countries could freely move back and forth. In exchange, Chey Chettha II gifted Prei Nokor to the [[Nguyễn lords]].<ref name=Song22>Song, Jeong Nam, Sự mở rộng lãnh thổ Đại Việt dưới thời Hậu Lê và tính chất, [[Korean University of Foreign Studies]], [[Seoul]], 2010, p.22</ref>  Vietnamese settlers began to migrate to the area of Saigon, Đồng Nai. Before that, the Funanese, Khmer, and Cham had lived there, scattered from time immemorial.

The period from 1623 to 1698 is considered the period of the formation of later Saigon. In 1623, Lord Nguyen sent a mission to ask his son-in-law, King Chey Chettha II, to set up tax collection stations in Prey Nokor (Sài Gòn) and Kas Krobei (Bến Nghé). Although this was a deserted jungle area, it was located on the traffic routes between Vietnam, Cambodia, and Siam. The next two important events of this period were the establishment of the barracks and residence of Vice King [[Ang Non]] and the establishment of a palace at Tân Mỹ (near the present-day Cống Quỳnh–Nguyễn Trãi crossroads). It can be said that Saigon was formed from these three government agencies.

In 1679, Lord [[Nguyễn Phúc Tần]] allowed a group of Chinese refugees from the [[Qing dynasty]] to settle in [[My Tho|Mỹ Tho]], [[Bien Hoa|Biên Hòa]] and Saigon to seek refuge. In 1698, [[Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh]], a Vietnamese noble, was sent by the Nguyễn rulers of [[Huế]] by sea to establish Vietnamese administrative structures in the area, thus detaching the area from Cambodia, which was not strong enough to intervene. He is often credited with the expansion of Saigon into a significant settlement.<ref>{{cite web |title=Chúa Nguyễn cử thống suất Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh vào Nam kinh lược |url=http://www.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/left/gioi_thieu/lich_su_van_hoa/lich_su/cong_cuoc_khai_duong_mo_loi/chua_nguyen_cu_thong_suat_nguyen_huu_canh_vao_nam_kinh_luoc?left_menu=1 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518155404/http://www.hochiminhcity.gov.vn/left/gioi_thieu/lich_su_van_hoa/lich_su/cong_cuoc_khai_duong_mo_loi/chua_nguyen_cu_thong_suat_nguyen_huu_canh_vao_nam_kinh_luoc?left_menu=1 |archive-date=2007-05-18 |access-date=2021-05-19 |website=HCM CityWeb |language=vi}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Harms |first=Erik |title=Saigon's Edge: On the Margins of Ho Chi Minh City |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-8166-5605-9 |location=Minnesota |page=11}}</ref> King [[Chey Chettha IV]] of Cambodia tried to stop the Vietnamese but was defeated by Nguyễn Hữu Cảnh in 1700.

===Rail===
The city is also a terminal for many [[Vietnam Railways]] train routes in the country. The [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|Reunification Express]] (tàu Thống Nhất) runs from Saigon to Hanoi from [[Saigon Railway Station]] in [[District 3, Ho Chi Minh City|District 3]], with stops at cities and provinces along the line.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://vietnam-railway.com/train/from/ho-chi-minh-city |title=Train from Ho Chi Minh City – Ticket fare and Schedule {{!}} Vietnam Railways |website=vietnam-railway.com |language=en |access-date=2017-01-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331124155/https://vietnam-railway.com/train/from/ho-chi-minh-city |archive-date=31 March 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> Within the city, the two main stations are Sóng Thần and Sài Gòn.

However, rail transport is not fully developed and presently comprises only 0.6% of passenger traffic and 6% of goods shipments.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url=http://www1.mt.gov.vn/ykienatgt/print.asp?ArticleId=2576 |title=Print Version |publisher=.mt.gov.vn |date=29 May 2008 |access-date=24 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401093127/http://www1.mt.gov.vn/ykienatgt/print.asp?ArticleId=2576 |archive-date=1 April 2012}}</ref>

===Water transport===
The city's location on the [[Saigon River]] makes it a bustling commercial and passenger port; besides a constant stream of cargo ships, passenger boats operate regularly between Ho Chi Minh City and various destinations in Southern Vietnam and Cambodia, including [[Vũng Tàu]], [[Cần Thơ]] and the [[Mekong Delta]], and [[Phnom Penh]]. Traffic between Ho Chi Minh City and Vietnam's southern provinces has steadily increased over the years; the Đôi and Tẻ Canals, the main routes to the Mekong Delta, receive 100,000 waterway vehicles every year, representing around 13&nbsp;million tons of cargo. A project to dredge these routes has been approved to facilitate transport, to be implemented in 2011–14.<ref name="waterway-expand">{{Cite news |url=http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/Economy/198826/City-to-expand-waterway-transport.html |title=City to expand waterway transport |date=19 April 2010 |agency=Vietnam News Service |access-date=3 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100421024424/http://vietnamnews.vnagency.com.vn/Economy/198826/City-to-expand-waterway-transport.html |archive-date=21 April 2010}}</ref> In 2017, the [[Saigon Waterbus]] launched, connecting [[District 1, Ho Chi Minh City|District 1]] to [[Thủ Đức|Thu Duc City]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=VnExpress |title=Saigon River bus not convenient enough to lure commuters - VnExpress International |url=https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/economy/saigon-river-bus-not-convenient-enough-to-lure-commuters-4016591.html |access-date=2022-08-31 |website=VnExpress International – Latest news, business, travel and analysis from Vietnam |language=en}}</ref>

====Bus====
Public buses run on many routes and tickets can be purchased on the bus. The city has a number of coach houses, which house [[coach bus]]es to and from other areas in Vietnam. The largest coach station – in terms of passengers handled – is the [[Mien Dong Coach Station|Miền Đông Coach Station]] in the [[Bình Thạnh District]].

===Private transport===
The main means of transport within the city are motorbikes, cars, buses, taxis, and bicycles. Motorbikes remain the most common way to move around the city. Taxis are plentiful and usually have metres, although it is also common to agree on a price before taking a long trip, for example, from the airport to the city centre. For short trips, "{{lang|vi|xe ôm}}" (literally, "hug vehicle") motorcycle taxis are available throughout the city, usually congregating at a major intersection. You can also book motorcycle and car taxis through ride-hailing apps like [[Grab (company)|Grab]] and [[GoJek]]. A popular activity for tourists is a tour of the city on [[Cycle rickshaw|cyclos]], which allow for longer trips at a more relaxed pace. For the last few years, cars have become more popular.<ref>{{cite web |last=VnExpress |title=November auto sales achieve year record – VnExpress International |url=https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/data-speaks/november-auto-sales-achieve-year-record-4207319.html |access-date=2020-12-17 |website=VnExpress International – Latest news, business, travel and analysis from Vietnam |language=en |archive-date=16 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201216134422/https://e.vnexpress.net/news/business/data-speaks/november-auto-sales-achieve-year-record-4207319.html |url-status=live}}</ref> There are approximately 340,000 cars and 3.5&nbsp;million motorcycles in the city, which is almost double compared with Hanoi.<ref name="autogenerated1" /> The growing number of cars tend to cause gridlock and contribute to air pollution.
