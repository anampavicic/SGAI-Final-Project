{{Coord|10|53|07|S|61|57|06|W|scale:70000|display=title}}'''Ji-Paraná''' is the second most populous municipality in the Brazilian state of [[Rondônia]], with a population of 130,009, and the 16th most populous city of the Brazilian North Region, the 210th most populous city of Brazil, and the 113th of the Brazilian interior. It has an area of 6,897&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/default.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-03 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070109005631/http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/default.php |archive-date=2007-01-09 }} - [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]</ref> The city is divided by the [[Ji-Paraná River]].

The city economy is industry and dairy production. The city was also the first of Rondônia State to invest in high technology of data transmission, when it connected, through a wireless network, the City Hall.{{cn|date=March 2023}}

The municipality name comes from [[Tupi language|tupi]], meaning "great river of axes", through the junction of ''yî'' (axe) ''e paranã'' (sea, great river). It is a reference to the great amount of rocks in the river looking like indigenous axes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Método Moderno de Tupi Antigo|last=Navarro|first=Eduardo de Almeida|author-link=Eduardo de Almeida Navarro |publisher=Global|year=2005|location=São Paulo|pages=370, 374}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://brazil1500.tripod.com/id18.html|title=SEJAM BEM VINDOS À CIDADE DE JI-PARANÁ}}</ref> The municipality is also known as the Heart of Rondônia, due to the central city location and the existence of a heart shaped island, located in the confluence of the Machado and Urupá River.

Located in central [[Rondônia]], the city attracted many settlers from the 1970s onward. As a result of corruption, lawlessness and a general lack of regulation, Ji-Paraná has been at the centre of Rondônia's extreme [[Deforestation in Brazil|deforestation]], which today extends up to the border with Bolivia. The area between Ji-Paraná and [[Porto Velho]], the regional capital 373&nbsp;km away, is now largely deforested. The deforestation expands along smaller illegally built roads stemming from the [[BR-364]] highway.

The city is served by [[Ji-Paraná Airport|José Coleto Airport]].

The municipality contains part of the {{convert|346861|ha}} [[Jaru Biological Reserve]], a fully protected conservation unit created in 1984.<ref>{{citation|language=pt |title=Unidade de Conservação: Reserva Biológica do Jaru|publisher=MMA: Ministério do Meio Ambiente |url=http://sistemas.mma.gov.br/cnuc/index.php?ido=relatorioparametrizado.exibeRelatorio&relatorioPadrao=true&idUc=208|access-date=2016-04-27}}</ref>

Isaú Raimundo da Fonseca is the city's current mayor, his term expires in 2024.<ref>[http://www.ji-parana.ro.gov.br/executivo.php] - [[City Hall of Ji-Paraná]]</ref>
