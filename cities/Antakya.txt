===Antiquity===
{{Main|Antioch}}
Humans have occupied the area of Antioch since the [[Chalcolithic]] ([[6th millennium BCE]]), as revealed by [[archaeological]] excavations of [[Alalakh]], among others.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

The Macedonian King [[Alexander the Great]], after defeating the [[Achaemenid Empire]] in the [[Battle of Issus]] in 333 BCE, followed the [[Orontes River|Orontes]] south into [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and occupied the area. The city of Antioch was founded in 300 BC, after the death of Alexander, by the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid emperor]] [[Seleucus I Nicator]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} It played an important role as one of the largest cities in the Seleucid, [[Roman Empire|Roman]], and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] empires. The city swapped hands between the Byzantines and the [[Sasanian Empire]] in the [[3rd century]]. It was the battleground for the [[Siege of Antioch (253)|253 siege of Antioch]] when [[Shapur I]] defeated the Roman army and the later [[Battle of Antioch (613)]] where the Persians were successful at capturing the city for the last time. It was a key city during the early [[history of Christianity]], in particular that of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], the [[Antiochian Orthodox Church]] and the [[Maronite Church]], as well as during the [[spread of Islam]] and the [[Crusades]].

===Biblical era===
From "The Acts of the Apostles", Chapter 11 Verse 26

''“And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.”''

===Rashidun period===
[[File:Fall of Antioch in 969.png|thumb|Recapture of Antioch in 969]]

In 637, during the reign of the Byzantine emperor [[Heraclius]], Antioch was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] during the [[Battle of the Iron Bridge]]. The city became known in Arabic as {{lang|ar|أنطاكية}} ({{transliteration|ar|ʾAnṭākiya}}). Since the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] was unable to penetrate the [[Anatolia]]n plateau, Antioch found itself on the frontline of the conflicts between two hostile empires during the next 350&nbsp;years, so that the city went into a precipitous decline. After the demise of Umayyad rule, Antioch became part of the [[Abbasids|Abbasid]] empire (except for a brief rule of the [[Tulunids]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://islamansiklopedisi.org.tr/ahmed-b-tolun | title=Ahemed b. Tolun }}</ref>), [[Ikhshidids]] and [[Hamdanids]].

In 969, the city was reconquered for the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Emperor [[Nikephoros II Phokas]] by [[Michael Bourtzes]] and the ''[[stratopedarches]]'' [[Peter (stratopedarches)|Peter]]. It soon became the seat of a ''[[dux]]'', who commanded the forces of the local [[Theme (Byzantine district)|themes]] and was the most important officer on the Empire's eastern border,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} held by such men as [[Nikephoros Ouranos]]. In 1078, [[Philaretos Brachamios]], an Armenian hero, seized power. He held the city until the [[Seljuk Turks]] captured it from him in 1084. The [[Sultanate of Rum]] held it only fourteen years before the Crusaders arrived.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}

===Crusader era===

{{Main|Principality of Antioch}}
The Crusaders' [[Siege of Antioch]] between October 1097 and June 1098 during the [[First Crusade]] resulted in its fall. The Crusaders caused significant damage, including a massacre of its population, both Christian and Muslim.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Burns|first=Ross|title=Aleppo, A History|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9780415737210|pages=109–111}}</ref> Following the defeat of Seljuk forces arriving with the aim to break the siege only four days after its capture by the crusaders, [[Bohemond I of Antioch|Bohemond I]] became its overlord.<ref name=":0" /> It remained the capital of the Latin [[Principality of Antioch]] for nearly two centuries.

In 1268 it fell to the [[Egypt]]ian [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] Sultan [[Baybars]] after [[Siege of Antioch (1268)|another siege]]. Baibars proceeded to massacre the Christian population.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Gazetteer/Places/Asia/Armenia/_Texts/KURARM/30*.html|title=History of Armenia by Vahan Kurkjian – Chapter 30|website=penelope.uchicago.edu}}</ref> In addition to suffering the ravages of war, the city lost its commercial importance because trade routes to [[East Asia]] moved north following the 13th-century [[Mongol]] conquests. Antioch never recovered as a major city, with much of its former role falling to the port city of [[Alexandretta]] (''İskenderun''). An account of both cities as they were in 1675 appears in the diary of the English naval chaplain [[Henry Teonge]].

===Ottoman city===
{{Expand section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:AntiochMap1912.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Densely built Antakya in 1912: the traditional Muslim city shows no trace of its Hellenistic planning. To the east, orchards (green) fill the plain.]]
The city was initially the centre of the [[Sanjak]] of Antakya, part of the [[Damascus Eyalet]]. It was laterly centre of [[Sanjak]] of Antakya in [[Aleppo Eyalet]]. It was finally kaza centre in [[Sanjak of Aleppo]], part of [[Aleppo Vilayet]].

In 1822 (and [[1872 Amik earthquake|again in 1872]]), Antakya was hit by [[1822 Aleppo earthquake|an earthquake]] and damaged. When Egyptian general [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]] established his headquarters in the city in 1835, it had only some 5,000 inhabitants. Supporters hoped the city might develop thanks to the [[Euphrates]] Valley [[Railway]], which was supposed to link it to the port of Sueida (now [[Samandağı (city)|Samandağı]]), but this plan never came to fruition. This scheme is the subject of [[Letitia Elizabeth Landon]]'s poem {{ws|[[s:Letitia Elizabeth Landon (L. E. L.) in Fisher's Drawing Room Scrap Book, 1837/Antioch|Antioch]]}} (1836) in which she reflects of the superiority of trade and commerce over war and conflict. The city suffered repeated outbreaks of [[cholera]] due to inadequate infrastructure for sanitation.{{sfn|Rockwell|1911|p=131}}  Later the city developed and rapidly resumed much of its old importance when a railway was built along the lower Orontes Valley.

===French Mandate and Turkish annexation===
Antioch was part of the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]] during the [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]], until it was made the [[Hatay State]] in 1938, after Turkish pressure.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Shields |first=Sarah D. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qsg-8PZ04yEC&pg=PA20 |title=Fezzes in the River: Identity Politics and European Diplomacy in the Middle East on the Eve of World War II |date=2011-03-16 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-979300-6 |language=en}}</ref> An [[Arab nationalist]] newspaper in the city, run by [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], was shut down by the Turks.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}} On May 30, 1938, an Arab was killed during a riot by a Turkish crowd.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book |last=De Giorgi |first=Andrea U. |title=Antioch: A History |last2=Eger |first2=A.

==Demographics==
===Language===
A British traveller visiting Antakya in 1798 reported that generally, Turkish was spoken, while, by contrast, the prevalent language in [[Aleppo]] at the time was Arabic.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=1nshAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA449 ''Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria, from the Year 1792 to 1798''], by William George Browne, year 1806 on page 449 (and page 442 for Aleppo).</ref> Most Alawites and Armenians spoke Turkish as a second language.<ref name=dump />

==Recent history==
[[File:AntakyaCarsi.JPG|thumb|The marketplace in central Antakya]]

Mount Habib-i Neccar (Habib An-Najar in ''[[Ya Sin|Sura al-Yassin]]'' 36:13) and the city walls which climb the hillsides symbolise Antakya, making the city a formidable fortress built on a series of hills running north-east to south-west. Antakya was originally centred on the east bank of the river. Since the 19th century, the city has expanded with new neighbourhoods built on the plains across the river to the south-west, and four bridges connect the old and new cities. Many of the buildings of the last two decades are styled as concrete blocks, and Antakya has lost much of its classic beauty.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} The narrow streets of the old city can become clogged with traffic.

Antakya is a provincial capital of considerable importance as the centre of a large district. The draining of [[Lake Amik]] and development of land have caused the region's economy to grow in wealth and productivity. The town is a lively shopping and business centre with many restaurants, cinemas and other amenities. This district is centred on a large park opposite the governor's building and the central avenue ''Kurtuluş Caddesı''. The tea gardens, cafes and restaurants in the neighbourhood of ''[[Harbiye, Antakya|Harbiye]]'' are popular destinations, particularly for the variety of ''[[meze]]'' in the restaurants. The [[Orontes river|Orontes River]] can be malodorous when water is low in summer. Rather than formal nightlife, in the summer heat, people will stay outside until late at the night to walk with their families and friends, and munch on snacks.

Its location near the Syrian border makes Antakya more cosmopolitan than many cities in Turkey. It did not attract the mass immigration of people from eastern Anatolia in the 1980s and 1990s that radically swelled the populations of Mediterranean cities such as [[Adana]] and [[Mersin]]. Both [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Arabic]] are still widely spoken in Antakya, although written Arabic is rarely used. A mixed community of faiths and denominations co-exist peacefully here. While almost all the inhabitants are [[Muslim]], a substantial proportion adhere to the [[Alevi]] and [[Alawites|Alawite]] traditions, in 'Harbiye' there is a place to honour the saint [[Khidr|Hızır]]. Numerous tombs of saints, of both [[Sunni]] and [[Alawite]], are located throughout the city. Several small [[Christianity in Turkey|Christian communities]] are active in the city, with the largest church being St. Peter and St. Paul on Hürriyet Avenue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edgeofhumanity.com/2017/02/07/faith-3/|title=Christian Arab Congregation In Antakya, Turkey|date=7 February 2017|publisher=Edge of Humanity Magazine}}</ref> With its long history of spiritual and religious movements, Antakya is a place of pilgrimage for Christians.

In the aftermath, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan promised to an immediate reconstruction of the affected areas. During a visit to the city in September 2023, ''The New York Times'' reported that heavily buildings were still being demolished and no large-scale reconstruction works were observed. Many damaged buildings remained standing but abandoned while survivors continue to live in tents. Hatay's mayor, Lutfu Savas, said only half of the estimated 38,000 buildings registered to be dismantled had been fulfilled. In Gülderen, there were ongoing works to build 2,300 apartment units in 122 blocks.<ref name="Hubbard">{{cite news |last1=Hubbard |first1=Ben |last2=Kirac |first2=Nimet |title=An Ancient City, Now in Ruins, Struggles to Keep Its Soul |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/01/world/middleeast/turkey-earthquake-antakya-reconstruction.html |access-date=18 November 2023 |agency=The New York Times |date=1 October 2023}}</ref>

==Geography==
Antakya is located on the banks of the [[Orontes River]] ({{langx|tr|Asi Nehri}}), approximately {{convert|22|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} inland from the [[Mediterranean]] coast. The city is in a valley surrounded by mountains, the [[Nur Mountains]] (ancient Amanos) to the northwest and Mount Keldağ (Jebel Akra) to the south, with the 440 m high Mount Habib-i Neccar (the ancient [[Silpium|Mount Silpius]]) forming its eastern limits. The mountains are a source of a green [[marble]]. Antakya is at the northern edge of the [[Dead Sea Rift]] and vulnerable to earthquakes.

The plain of [[Amik Valley|Amik]] to the north-east of the city is fertile soil watered by the Orontes, the [[Karasu (Hatay)|Karasu]] and the [[Afrin River|Afrin]] rivers; the lake in the plain was drained in 1980 by a French company. At the same time channels were built to widen the Orontes and let it pass neatly through the city centre. The Orontes is joined in Antakya by the Hacı Kürüş stream to the north-east of the city near the church of St Peter, and the Hamşen which runs down from Habib-i Neccar to the south-west, under Memekli Bridge near the army barracks. Flora includes the [[bay Laurel|bay tree]]s and [[myrtle (common)|myrtle]].

* ''Müşebbek'' - rings of deep fried pastry.
* ''Peynirli irmik helvası'' - Peynirli İrmik Helvası is a dessert that is made of semolina, sugar and traditional cheese that is the same as used in künefe. It is served warm, especially in restaurants in the region Harbiye, rather than künefe shops that are located in the centre.
