'''Singapore''',{{efn|{{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Singapore.ogg|ˈ|s|ɪ|ŋ|(|g|)|ə|p|ɔːr}} {{respell|SING|(g)ə|por}}}} officially the '''Republic of Singapore''', is an [[island country]] and [[city-state]] in [[maritime Southeast Asia]]. The country's territory comprises one [[Singapore Island|main island]], [[List of islands of Singapore|63 satellite islands and islets]], and [[Pedra Branca, Singapore|one outlying islet]]. It is about one [[degree of latitude]] ({{Convert|137|km|disp=or}}) north of the [[equator]], off the southern tip of the [[Malay Peninsula]], bordering the [[Strait of Malacca]] to the west, the [[Singapore Strait]] to the south along with the [[Riau Islands]] in [[Indonesia]], the [[South China Sea]] to the east, and the [[Straits of Johor]] along with the [[Johor|State of Johor]] in [[Malaysia]] to the north.

Singapore's [[Early history of Singapore|history]] dates back at least eight hundred years, having been a maritime [[Emporium (antiquity)|emporium]] known as ''[[Temasek]]'' and subsequently a major constituent part of several successive [[thalassocratic]] empires. Its contemporary era began in 1819, when [[Stamford Raffles]] established Singapore as an [[entrepôt]] trading post of the [[British Empire]]. In 1867, Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the [[Straits Settlements]]. During [[World War II]], Singapore was [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|occupied by Japan]] in 1942 and returned to British control as a separate [[Colony of Singapore|Crown colony]] following [[Surrender of Japan|Japan's surrender]] in 1945. Singapore gained [[Self-governance of Singapore|self-governance]] in 1959 and, in 1963, became part of the new federation of [[Malaysia]], alongside [[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]], [[Crown Colony of North Borneo|North Borneo]], and [[Crown Colony of Sarawak|Sarawak]]. [[Singapore in Malaysia|Ideological differences]] led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation two years later; Singapore became an independent [[Sovereign state|sovereign country]] in 1965. After early years of [[History of the Republic of Singapore#1965 to Late 1970s|turbulence]] and despite lacking natural resources and a [[hinterland]], the nation rapidly developed to become one of the [[Four Asian Tigers]].

As a highly [[developed country]], it has one of the [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|highest GDP per capita (PPP)]] in the world. It is also identified as a [[tax haven]]. Singapore is the only country in Asia with a AAA [[Credit rating#Sovereign credit ratings|sovereign credit rating]] from [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|all major rating agencies]]. It is a major [[Airline hub|aviation]], [[Financial centre|financial]], and [[Port|maritime shipping]] hub and has consistently been ranked as one of the [[List of most expensive cities for expatriate employees|most expensive cities]] to live in for [[expatriate]]s and [[foreign worker]]s. Singapore ranks highly in key social indicators: [[Education in Singapore|education]], [[Healthcare in Singapore|healthcare]], [[quality of life]], [[personal safety]], [[infrastructure]], and [[public housing in Singapore|housing]], with a [[List of countries by home ownership rate|home-ownership rate]] of 88 percent. [[Singaporeans]] enjoy one of the [[List of countries by life expectancy|longest life expectancies]], [[List of countries by Internet connection speeds|fastest Internet connection speeds]], [[List of countries by infant and under-five mortality rates|lowest infant mortality rates]], and [[Corruption Perceptions Index|lowest levels of corruption]] in the world. It has the [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|third highest population density of any country in the world]], although there are numerous green and recreational spaces as a result of [[urban planning]]. With a multicultural population and in recognition of the cultural identities of the major ethnic groups within the nation, Singapore has four [[Languages of Singapore|official languages]]: [[Singaporean English|English]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Singaporean Mandarin|Mandarin]], and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. English is the [[lingua franca|common language]], with exclusive use in numerous [[public service]]s. [[multiculturalism|Multi-racialism]] is enshrined in the constitution and continues to shape [[Race in Singapore|national policies]] in education, housing, and politics.

Singapore is a [[parliamentary republic]] in the [[Westminster system|Westminster tradition]] of [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] parliamentary government, and its legal system is based on [[common law]]. While the country is ''[[de jure]]'' a [[multi-party democracy]] with [[General elections in Singapore|free elections]], the [[Government of Singapore|government]] under the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) wields widespread control and [[dominant-party system|political dominance]]. The PAP has governed the country continuously since full internal [[Self-governance of Singapore#Full internal self-government (1959–1963)|self-government]] was achieved in 1959, and holds a [[supermajority]] in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]]. One of the five founding members of [[ASEAN]], Singapore is also the headquarters of the [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] Secretariat, the [[Pacific Economic Cooperation Council]] Secretariat, and is the host city of many [[MICE (Meetings, Incentives, Conferences, Exhibitions) tourism|international conferences and events]]. Singapore is also a member of the [[United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[East Asia Summit]], the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], and the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].

== Name and etymology ==
{{Main|Names of Singapore}}
The [[English language|English]] name of "Singapore" is an [[anglicisation]] of the native [[Malay language|Malay]] name for the country, {{lang|ms|Singapura}} ({{IPA-ms|siŋapura|pron}}), which was in turn derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word for 'lion city' ({{langx|sa|सिंहपुर}}; <small>[[International Alphabet of Sanskrit Transliteration|romanised:]]</small> {{lang|sa-Latn|Siṃhapura}}; [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]]: {{lang|sa-Brah|𑀲𑀺𑀁𑀳𑀧𑀼𑀭}}; literally "lion city"; {{wikt-lang|sa|सिंह|siṃha|script=Latn}} means 'lion', {{wikt-lang|sa|पुर|pura|script-Latn}} means 'city' or 'fortress').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/S0424600.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010411060419/http://www.bartleby.com/61/46/S0424600.html|url-status=dead |archive-date=11 April 2001 |title=Singapore |publisher=Bartleby |access-date=13 May 2020}}</ref> [[Singapore Island|Pulau Ujong]] was one of the earliest references to Singapore Island, which corresponds to a Chinese account from the third century referred to a place as ''[[Pulau Ujong|Pú Luó Zhōng]]'' ({{zh|c=[[wikt:蒲|蒲]] [[wikt:羅|羅]] [[wikt:中|中]]}}), a transcription of the [[Malay language|Malay]] name for 'island at the end of [[Malay Peninsula|a peninsula]]'.<ref name="utexas">{{cite web |title=Singapore: History, Singapore 1994 |url=http://inic.utexas.edu/asnic/countries/singapore/Singapore-History.html |publisher=Asian Studies @ University of Texas at Austin |access-date=13 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323095958/http://inic.utexas.edu/asnic/countries/Singapore/Singapore-History.html |archive-date=23 March 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Early references to the name [[Temasek]] (or Tumasik) are found in the [[Nagarakretagama]], a [[Java (island)|Javanese]] [[eulogy]] written in 1365, and a [[Vietnam]]ese source from the same time period.

Variations of the name {{lang|sa-Latn|Siṃhapura}} were used for a number of cities throughout the region prior to the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Singapura]]. In [[Buddhism and Hinduism|Hindu–Buddhist culture]], lions were associated with power and protection, which may explain the attraction of such a name.{{sfn|Miksic|2013|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=bMt3BgAAQBAJ&pg=PA151 151–152]}}<ref>{{cite news |url=https://mothership.sg/2016/12/5-other-places-in-asia-which-are-also-called-singapura/ |title=5 other places in Asia which are also called Singapura |author=Joshua Lee |work=Mothership |date=6 December 2016 |access-date=13 May 2020 |archive-date=6 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230406022412/https://mothership.sg/2016/12/5-other-places-in-asia-which-are-also-called-singapura/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The name ''Singapura'' supplanted [[Temasek]] sometime before the 15th century, after the establishment of the [[Kingdom of Singapura]] on the island by a fleeing Sumatran ''[[Raja]]'' (prince) from [[Palembang]].

The semi-historical [[Malay Annals]] state that [[Temasek]] was christened ''Singapura'' by [[Sang Nila Utama]], a 13th-century Sumatran ''[[Raja]]'' from [[Palembang]].

As a consequence, after [[World War II]] broke out in 1939, the fleet was fully occupied with defending Britain, leaving Singapore vulnerable to [[Japanese occupation of Singapore|Japanese invasion]].<ref name="LambTarling2001">{{cite book |last1=Lamb |first1=Margaret |last2=Tarling |first2=Nicholas |title=From Versailles to Pearl Harbor: The Origins of the Second World War in Europe and Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4izcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA39 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200818180438/https://books.google.com/books?id=4izcCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA39 |url-status=dead |archive-date=18 August 2020 |date=2001 |publisher=Macmillan International Higher Education |isbn=978-1-4039-3772-8 |page=39}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BH88kpvyrdYC&pg=PA90 |title=Marshall of Singapore: A Biography |last=Tan |first=Kevin |isbn=978-981-230-878-8 |year=2008 |publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies}}</ref>

During the [[Pacific War]], the Japanese [[Malayan campaign|invasion of Malaya]] culminated in the [[Battle of Singapore]]. When the British force of 60,000 troops surrendered on 15 February 1942, British prime minister Winston Churchill called the defeat "the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/15/newsid_3529000/3529447.stm |title=On This Day&nbsp;– 15 February 1942: Singapore forced to surrender |access-date=1 May 2007 |publisher=BBC News |date=15 February 1942 |archive-date=19 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190519174009/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/15/newsid_3529000/3529447.stm |url-status=live}}</ref> British and Empire losses during the fighting for Singapore were heavy, with a total of nearly 85,000 personnel captured.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=382}} About 5,000 were killed or wounded,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-singapore |title=Battle of Singapore |publisher=World History Group |access-date=8 May 2015 |archive-date=12 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512181020/http://www.historynet.com/battle-of-singapore |url-status=live}}</ref> of which [[Australians]] made up the majority.{{sfn|Legg|1965|p=248}}<ref>{{cite news |title=1,000 Aussie victims of WWII join suit against Japan |first=Teresa |last=Ooi |newspaper=[[The Straits Times]] |location=Singapore |date=17 January 1995}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=South West Pacific War: Australia's Fine Record |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19460912-1.2.47?ST=1&AT=search&k=battle%20of%20singapore,%20world%20war%20ii,%20australians&QT=battle,of,singapore,world,war,ii,australians&oref=article |newspaper=The Straits Times |location=Singapore |date=12 September 1946 |access-date=22 October 2019 |archive-date=20 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191220093327/https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19460912-1.2.47?ST=1&AT=search&k=battle%20of%20singapore,%20world%20war%20ii,%20australians&QT=battle,of,singapore,world,war,ii,australians&oref=article |url-status=live}}</ref> Japanese casualties during the fighting in Singapore amounted to 1,714 killed and 3,378 wounded.{{sfn|Wigmore|1957|p=382}}{{efn|The breakdown of British Empire losses included 38,496 United Kingdom, 18,490 Australian, 67,340 Indian and 14,382 local volunteer troops.

After the [[Surrender of Japan|Japanese surrender]] to the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] on 15 August 1945, Singapore fell into a brief state of violence and disorder; looting and revenge-killing were widespread. British, Australian, and Indian troops led by Lord [[Louis Mountbatten]] [[Operation Tiderace|returned to Singapore]] to receive the formal surrender of Japanese forces in the region from General [[Seishirō Itagaki]] on behalf of General [[Hisaichi Terauchi]] on 12 September 1945.{{sfn|Bose|2010|pp=18–20}}<ref name="auto1" /> Meanwhile, [[Tomoyuki Yamashita]] was tried by a US military commission for war crimes, but not for crimes committed by his troops in Malaya or Singapore.

Much of the infrastructure in Singapore had been destroyed during the war, including those needed to supply utilities. A shortage of food led to malnutrition, disease, and rampant crime and violence. A series of strikes in 1947 caused massive stoppages in public transport and other services. However, by late 1947 the economy began to recover, facilitated by a growing international demand for tin and rubber.<ref name="uslcAftermathOfWar">{{cite web |title=Singapore – Aftermath of War |url=http://countrystudies.us/singapore/9.htm |publisher=U.S. Library of Congress |access-date=16 May 2020 |archive-date=14 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514010408/http://countrystudies.us/singapore/9.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> The failure of Britain to successfully defend its colony against the Japanese changed its image in the eyes of Singaporeans.

PAP leaders believed that Singapore's future lay with Malaya, due to strong ties between the two. It was thought that reuniting with Malaya would benefit the economy by creating a common market, alleviating ongoing unemployment woes in Singapore. However, a sizeable left-wing faction of the PAP was strongly opposed to the merger, fearing a loss of influence, and hence formed the [[Barisan Sosialis]], after being kicked out from the PAP.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lee |first=T.

Literature of Singapore, or "SingLit", consists of a collection of literary works by Singaporeans written chiefly in the country's four official languages: English, Malay, Mandarin, and Tamil. Singapore is increasingly regarded as having four sub-literatures instead of one. Many significant works have been translated and showcased in publications such as the literary journal ''Singa'', published in the 1980s and 1990s with editors including [[Edwin Thumboo]] and [[Koh Buck Song]], as well as in multilingual anthologies such as ''Rhythms: A Singaporean Millennial Anthology Of Poetry'' (2000), in which the poems were all translated three times each. A number of Singaporean writers such as [[Tan Swie Hian]] and [[Kuo Pao Kun]] have contributed work in more than one language.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/arts/poet-feature-singapores-unique-language-in-literature |title=Singapore Writers Festival: Feature Singapore's unique language in literature, says poet |newspaper=The Straits Times|access-date=27 August 2019 |date=5 November 2018 |last1=Toh |first1=Wen Li}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/kbolton/pdf/(2014)%20Bolton%20and%20Ng.pdf |title=The dynamics of multilingualism in contemporary Singapore |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]]|access-date=27 August 2019|archive-date=28 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328194001/http://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/kbolton/pdf/(2014)%20Bolton%20and%20Ng.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Singapore has a diverse music culture that ranges from pop and rock, to folk and classical.
