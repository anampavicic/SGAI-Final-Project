'''Suez Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|محافظة السويس}} {{transl|ar|''Muḥāfāzah as-Suways''}}) is one of the [[governorates of Egypt]]. It is located in the north-eastern part of the country and is coterminous with the city of [[Suez]]. It is situated north of the [[Gulf of Suez]].

The Suez Governorate is one of the most urbanized regions in Egypt, alongside [[Cairo]] and [[Port Said]]. The governorate hosts several industrial zones, including zones for light and heavy industries, as well as new urban community industrial zones. A notable development is the agreement between [[Russia]] and [[Egypt]] in mid-2018 for the establishment of a Russian Industrial Zone within the governorate.

Suez is also home to five significant ports: Ain Sokhna port, Suez port, Adabeya port, petrol basin port, and El-Atka fishing port. These ports play a role in the governorate's economy, which is bolstered by natural resources such as limestone, clay, coal, petroleum, marble, and lime. The region's chief export is papayas.

Tourism is an important sector in Suez Governorate, with attractions like [[Ain Sokhna]], known for its recreational and medical facilities, Moses' springs, and Judaic Hill at El-Khoor. Additionally, the Suez Public Free Zone, established in 1975, further enhances the economic landscape, being divided between Suez Port and Adabeya.

==Municipal divisions==
The governorate is divided into the following [[Subdivisions of Egypt#Municipal divisions|municipal divisions]] for administrative purposes, with a total estimated population as of January 2023 of 788,421.<ref name="CAPMAS2023" />
