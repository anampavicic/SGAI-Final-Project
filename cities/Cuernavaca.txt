'''Cuernavaca''' ({{IPA|es|audio=Cuernavaca.ogg|kweɾnaˈβaka}}; {{langx|nci|Cuauhnāhuac}} {{IPA|nci|kʷawˈnaːwak|}}, "near the woods" {{audio|Kuaujnawak.ogg|modern pronunciation}}, [[Otomi language|Otomi]]: {{Lang|ote|Ñu'iza}}) is the capital and largest city of the [[Mexican state|state]] of [[Morelos]] in [[Mexico]]. Along with Chalcaltzingo, it is likely one of the origins of the [[Mesoamerica|Mesoamerican]] civilization.  Olmec works of art, currently displayed in the Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City were found in the Gualupita III archeological site. 

The city is located south of [[Mexico City]] and reached via a 90-minute drive using the [[Mexican Federal Highway 95D|Federal Highway 95D]].<ref name="wright">{{cite web |first=Anthony |last=Wright |title=In Morelos, Cuernavaca springs eternal |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3365-in-morelos-cuernavaca-springs-eternal |work=MexConnect |date=17 April 2009 |access-date=28 September 2009 |archive-date=23 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323172857/http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/3365-in-morelos-cuernavaca-springs-eternal |url-status=live }}</ref>

The name ''Cuernavaca'' is a [[phonaesthetics|euphonism]] derived from the [[Nahuatl]] toponym {{lang|nci|Cuauhnāhuac}} and means 'surrounded by or close to trees'. The name was Hispanicized to ''Cuernavaca''; [[Hernán Cortés]] called it ''Coadnabaced'' in his letters to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Bernal Díaz del Castillo]] used the name ''Cuautlavaca'' in his chronicles.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://verne.elpais.com/verne/2017/03/28/mexico/1490652858_045140.html |work=[[El País]] |title=Estos 11 nombres Mexicanos surgiegeron por malentendidos entre los Españoles y los y los pueblos Mesoamericanos |date=28 March 2017 |access-date=30 December 2018 |language=es |trans-title=These 11 names came from misunderstandings between the Spanish and the Mesoamerican peoples |archive-date=31 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181231092402/https://verne.elpais.com/verne/2017/03/28/mexico/1490652858_045140.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The coat-of-arms of the municipality is based on the pre-Columbian pictograph emblem of the city that depicts a tree trunk ({{lang|nci|cuahuitl}}) with three branches, with foliage, and four roots colored red.

Cuernavaca has long been a favorite escape for Mexico City residents and foreign visitors because of its warm, stable climate and abundant vegetation. The municipality was designated a Forest Protection Zone by President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] in 1937 to protect the aquifers, the vegetation, and the quality of life of residents, both in Mexico City and locally.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cuernavaca.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Proy-Acuerdo-Declarat-area-nat-BOSQUE-MIRADOR-1.pdf |title=Acuerdo por el que se declara el área natural protegida denominada "Bosque Mirador" |trans-title=Agreement declaring the protected natural area called "Bosque Mirador" |publisher=City of Cuernavaca |access-date=30 December 2018 |archive-date=31 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181231092550/http://www.cuernavaca.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Proy-Acuerdo-Declarat-area-nat-BOSQUE-MIRADOR-1.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city was nicknamed the "City of Eternal Spring" by [[Alexander von Humboldt]] in the 19th century.<ref name="verdadera">{{cite web |first=Barbara |last=Kastelein |url=http://www.revistatravesias.com/numero-59/fin-de-semana/cuernavaca-la-verdadera-historia-de-su-eterna-primavera.html |work=Revista Travesias |location=Mexico City |title=Cuernavaca: la verdadera historia de su eterna primavera |trans-title=Cuernavaca: The true story of its eternal spring |date=November 2006 |access-date=28 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920124640/http://www.revistatravesias.com/numero-59/fin-de-semana/cuernavaca-la-verdadera-historia-de-su-eterna-primavera.html |archive-date=20 September 2009 }}</ref>

===City of Eternal Spring===
[[File:Jardin borda.jpg|thumb|Flora in the Jardín Borda]]
Cuernavaca was one of the cities of the world [[nickname]]d "City of Eternal Spring". This appelative derived from [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s  ''Researches concerning the institutions & monuments of the ancient inhabitants of America...:''<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Humboldt|first1=Alexander von|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/125538|title=Researches concerning the institutions & monuments of the ancient inhabitants of America : with descriptions & views of some of the most striking scenes in the Cordilleras!|last2=Williams|first2=Helen Maria|date=1814|publisher=Published by Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme & Brown, J.

The city is located in a tropical region, but its temperature is fairly constant at {{convert|70|-|79|F|C|order=flip}}. It is located on the southern slope of the ''Sierra de Chichinautzin'' mountains. In the morning, warm air flows up the mountains from the valley below and in the late afternoon, cooler air flows down from the higher elevations. One ubiquitous flowering plant in the city is the [[bougainvillea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.planeta.com/ecotravel/mexico/gardens/cuernavaca.html |last=Robleda de Buckley |first=Blanca |title=Ethnobotanical Garden in Cuernavaca |date=16 April 2016 |access-date=15 January 2019 |archive-date=16 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190116095852/http://old.planeta.com/ecotravel/mexico/gardens/cuernavaca.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

This pleasant climate has attracted royalty and nobles since Aztec times. Foreign princes, archdukes, and other nobles have been attracted to this place because of its flowers, sun, fruits, fresh-water springs, and waterfalls. Emperor [[Maximilian I of Mexico]] set up a country residence in the city.

Cuernavaca always has been a popular place for people from Mexico City to escape the city.<ref name="tusbuenasnoticias2">{{Cite news|url=https://www.tusbuenasnoticias.com/mexico/general/casetas-de-autopista-cuernavaca-acapulco-libres-de-pago/34598 |title = Casetas de Autopista Cuernavaca-Acapulco se mantienen libres de peaje: Nuño Lara|newspaper = Tus Buenas Noticias|date = 21 June 2024}}</ref> In the 20th century, the climate and flora began to attract many foreigners as well. Population increase in this urban area began in 1940, but the metro area was not created, nor recognized, until the 1960s. From this time the population and the extension of the metropolitan area have grown. From 1960 to 1980, the population had grown from 85,620 to 368,166. From the 1980s to the present, the municipalities of [[Emiliano Zapata, Morelos|Emiliano Zapata]], [[Jiutepec]], [[Texmixco, Morelos|Temixco]], [[Tepoztlán]], and [[Xochitepec]] have been added to the metropolitan area. These municipalities have seen the highest rates of growth, however; population and economic activity remain concentrated in the city of Cuernavaca proper. The metropolitan area has a population of 912,024 and the municipality has 366,321 inhabitants, as of 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://en.www.inegi.org.mx/app/areasgeograficas/?ag=17 |title=Mexico in Figures |date=January 2016 |publisher=Insituto Nacional de Estadistica y Geografia |access-date=18 December 2018 |archive-date=19 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219000820/http://en.www.inegi.org.mx/app/areasgeograficas/?ag=17 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Over the decades since 1970, this metropolitan area has become more economically and socially integrated with the Mexico City metropolitan area. Many people from Mexico City own second homes there for weekend retreats, both for the climate and for the well-developed infrastructure. Starting in the 1980s permanent migration of Mexico City residents began, spurred by pollution and crime problems in the capital. The [[1985 Mexico City earthquake]] also pushed many well-to-do families there, fearful of the next catastrophe. In many of these cases, the main breadwinner commutes each day to work in Mexico City. This has produced a considerable increase in housing developments on the outskirts of the city, especially in the late 1990s and 2000s. This influx has had a positive economic benefit for the city but has put pressure on the infrastructure as well. 85% of the city of Cuernavaca is dedicated to housing, and much of this is in middle-class housing developments such as ''Rancho Cortés, Rancho Tetela'', and ''Colonia del Bosque'', which are located on the outskirts of the city. Lower-income housing is concentrated in the city proper.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

==History==

===Indigenous peoples===
[[File:Cuernavaca Teopanzolco.JPG|thumb|Ruins at Teopanzolco, Cuernavaca]]
Burials dated to c. 1000 [[BCE]] have been found in Gualupita, Morelos, in the north of the city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Evans|first1=Susan Toby|last2=Webster|first2=David L.|title=Archaeology of Ancient Mexico and Central America: An Encyclopedia|date=2001|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=New York|isbn=0-8153-0887-6|page=304|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZ3DAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA304|access-date=22 December 2017|language=en|archive-date=1 February 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240201214825/https://books.google.com/books?id=vZ3DAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA304#v=onepage&q&f=false|url-status=live}}</ref>

The first major culture to inhabit this area was the [[Tlahuica]], whose main settlement was where the city of Cuernavaca is today. The Tlahuicas have inhabited this area at least since the 12th century.<ref name="rumbo" />

The first incursions south into the area by peoples of the [[Valley of Mexico]] occurred in the 12th century, when a lord named Xolotl (ruler of [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Tetzcoco]]) conquered most of the Valley of Mexico. An allied [[Chichimeca]] tribe also moved south into what is now northern Morelos state, making Techintecuitla lord of the Cuauhnahuac (as they called the city) area, with the Tlahuicas concentrated in the nearby towns of Yecapixtla and Yautecatle. According to the Tlatelolco Annals, in 1365, the lord of Cuauhnahuac, Macuilxochitl, tried to conquer lands as far as the Valley of Mexico, but was met by the lord of [[Chalco (altépetl)|Chalco]], Tzalcualtitlan, with similar ambitions.<ref name="machistoria">{{cite web |author=Municipality of Cuernavaca |title=Historia |url=http://mac.cuernavaca.gob.mx/portal/secciones/historia/index.php |publisher=Municipality of Cuernavaca |location=Cuernavaca, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=History |access-date=28 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091012202546/http://mac.cuernavaca.gob.mx/portal/secciones/historia/index.php |archive-date=12 October 2009 }}</ref>

The first [[Aztec]] emperor, [[Acamapichtli]], began to expand his empire to the south of the Valley of Mexico and beyond in the 1370s. His successor, [[Huitzilihuitl]], was eager to press on into what is now Morelos state because of the cotton grown there, it was called ''Tlalnahuatl'' at that time. He asked to marry the daughter of the ruler of Tlalnahuatl but was rejected. That rejection started a war that ended with an Aztec victory in 1396. ''Huitziliuitl'' then married the princess and [[Moctezuma I]] was born of the union. Credit for the conquest of Cuernavaca is given to Acamapichtli in the ''Mendocino Codex'', but later writings cite [[Itzcóatl]], or even Moctezuma I, as the conqueror. The conquered dominion, ''Tlalnahuac'', was roughly the size of the modern state of Morelos, and subsequently was renamed as ''Cuauhnahuac'' by the Aztecs.<ref name="machistoria" />

From 1403 to 1426, this province grew in strength, subduing neighboring peoples such as the ''Coauixcas''. Eventually, the province, then ruled by Miquiuix, rebelled against the Aztec Empire. This rebellion was put down by [[Totoquihuatzin]] and [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Netzahualcoyotl]] in 1433. This area then joined in the conquests of what now are known as [[Taxco]], [[Tepecoacuilco de Trujano|Tepecuacuilco]], and [[Ocuilán]]. For tribute purposes, the dominion was divided into two zones, one headed by Cuauhnahuac and the other by [[Oaxtepec|Huaxtepec]].<ref name="machistoria" />

===Spanish Conquest and colonization===
[[File:Cuernavaca Palacio Cortes.JPG|thumb|View of the [[Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca|Palace of Cortés]], the oldest conserved colonial era civil structure on the continental Americas]]

At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|Spanish Conquest]], Itzohuatzin was governing Cuauhnahuac. It was a rich city and densely populated, with large farms and its characteristic ravines bridged over. The Spanish marched on Cuernavaca even before taking the Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan]].<ref name=Diaz>Diaz, B., 1963, ''The Conquest of New Spain'', London: Penguin Books, {{ISBN|0140441239}}</ref>{{rp|338–340}}  They were led by [[Gonzalo de Sandoval]] and he was joined later by the [[conquistador]], [[Hernán Cortés]].<ref name="machistoria" /> The bridges were destroyed to prevent the Spanish from entering the city, but they were able to cross on a fallen tree. The Spanish troops pillaged and burned the city before retiring to nearby [[Acapantzingo, Cuernavaca|Acapantzingo]], where they celebrated the first mass in Morelos on Sunday, 14 April 1521, before continuing their march on the capital.<ref>{{cite book|title=Acapantzingo, Tierra Florida de Historia y Tradiciones|language=es|pages=28, 101|trans-title=Acapantzingo, Flowered land of history and Traditions|first=Ma.

Cortés returned to Cuernavaca in 1523, stopping in Tlaltenango, where he founded the Church of San José and constructed the first sugar plantation. The fertility of these lands compelled the conquistador to found his favorite residence here.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Juana de Zúñiga, Cortes's wife, lived in Cuernavaca in the [[Palace of Cortés, Cuernavaca|palace]] that was constructed in 1526. Cortes then moved the hacienda in Tlaltenango to Amatitlan.<ref name="encmuc" /> The [[Franciscans]] arrived in Cuernavaca in 1529 and founded their 5th monastery in [[New Spain]] there. This first group included ''Martín de Lua, Francisco Martínez, Luis Ortiz, Juan de Cervo, Francisco de Soto, Andrés de Córdova, Martín de Jesús, [[Juan Juárez]], Juan de Motolinía'', and ''Juan García de Cervo''.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} Originally they lived at the San Francisquito hermitage, but later they constructed the open-air chapel, [[Capilla Abierta]], at what was to become a monastery and eventually the [[Cuernavaca Cathedral]]. They extended their presence into the neighboring communities of [[Tetecala, Morelos|Tetecala]], [[Jiutepec]], and [[Tlaquiltenango]], among others, eventually forming the province of Santo Evangelio, which would be part of the province of Mexico in 1543.

In 1646, this province was reorganized several times. Cuernavaca and Cuautla became high mayorships which answered directly to the viceregal authorities in Mexico City. In 1786, New Spain was divided into twelve provinces and in 1824, Cuernavaca was initially a district of Mexico City.<ref name="machistoria" />

Between 1827 and 1829, Cuernavaca was a district of this state. From 1829 to 1833, it was called a prefecture. In 1833, the State of Mexico declared the Atlacomulco Hacienda, which contains the Palacio de Cortés and Cortés's houses in [[Coyoacán]], to be public property.<ref name="machistoria" />

In 1834, Ignacio Echevarría and [[José María Tornel]] drafted the [[Plan of Cuernavaca]], which permitted [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] to disregard the laws protecting church property, exile [[Valentín Gómez Farías]], reopen the university, and dissolve the tribunal that was set to convict [[Anastasio Bustamante]] for the assassination of Vicente Guerrero. In the same year, the State of Mexico declared Cuernavaca to be a city.<ref name="machistoria" /><ref name="elclima.com.mx"/>

During the [[Mexican–American War]] (1846-1847), Cuernavaca was captured by the [[George Cadwalader|Cadwalader Brigade]] and was forced to pay retributions to the U.S. Army after the Cuernavaca Infantry under [[Francisco Modesto Olabuibel]] fell.

During the [[Ayutla Rebellion]] in 1854, Santa Anna was forced out of the capital of Mexico City in 1855. He moved his government to Cuernavaca, reorganized it, and named a junta to elect an interim president. This junta consisted of [[Valentín Gómez Farías]], [[Melchor Ocampo]], [[Benito Juárez]], [[Francisco de P. Zendejas]], Diego Álvarez, and [[Joaquín Moreno]]. They then voted for Alvarez as president. This new president swore to uphold the Plan of Ayutla and his inauguration was celebrated with much pomp in the city.<ref name="machistoria" /> Ministers from Guatemala, the United States, and Great Britain, as well as the Apostolic Delegate and the Consuls of Belgium, Chile, and some Asian countries, moved to Cuernavaca and recognized the Álvarez government.<ref name="elclima.com.mx"/>

In 1853, the District of Cuernavaca and the District of Mexico were declared separate.<ref name="machistoria" />

During the [[Reform War]] (1857–1860) when conservatives rejected the liberal constitution of 1857, Juan Vicario voiced the cry of "Religión y Fueros" (Religion and Immunity) in Cuernavaca on 13 January 1858. In 1861, the Government of the State of Mexico created the districts of Cuernavaca, Jonacatepec, Tautepec, and Tetecala.<ref name="encmuc" />

In order to facilitate operations against the French during the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention]], President Juarez divided the State of Mexico into three military districts. The third consisted of the territories of Cuernavaca, [[Yautepec de Zaragoza|Yautepec]], and Tetecala, with its capital in the city of Cuernavaca. Soon thereafter, this district fell into French hands. [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] converted the Borda Garden into his summer residence and bought land in nearby [[Acapantzingo, Cuernavaca|Acapantzingo]] to construct a chalet. This prompted the construction of the Mexico-Cuernavaca highway.<ref name="machistoria" />

When the French-installed monarch fell in 1867, Republican forces under [[Francisco Leyva]], [[Ignacio Figueroa]], and [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]] laid siege to Cuernavaca, which was defended by General Joaquín Ayestarán. The attackers cut off water supplies to the city and attacked on 3 January, but were met with a long series of street battles throughout the city. During the fighting, the general was killed and the Republican forces withdrew, victorious, to Mexico City, but only after burning a large portion of the city.<ref name="machistoria" />

The State of Morelos was created in April 1869, with General Francisco Leyva as its first governor. Cuernavaca was declared the capital of the new state in November of the same year. In 1877, under Governor [[Carlos Pacheco]], the [[Toluca]]-Cuernavaca highway was built and a rail connection created between Cuernavaca and Mexico City. The Porfirio Díaz Theater was opened in February 1882, and the first Public Health Board in the city was established the same year.<ref name="elclima.com.mx"/> In 1891, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cuernavaca|Diocese of Cuernavaca]] was established by [[Pope Leo XII]], comprising the entire state of Morelos, with Hipolito Vera as the first bishop of Cuernavaca.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diocesisdecuernavaca.org.mx/wp/historia/ |title=Historia |publisher=Diocesis de Cuernavaca |access-date=19 January 2019 |language=es |trans-title=History |archive-date=20 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190120144340/http://www.diocesisdecuernavaca.org.mx/wp/historia/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The first locomotive arrived on 1 December 1897, and a bridge was constructed to connect the center of the city with the train station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.moreloshabla.com/morelos/cuernavaca/puente-porfirio-diaz-sitio-historico-de-cuernavaca/ |title=Puente Porfirio Díaz, sitio histórico de Cuernavaca |publisher=Morelos Habla |date=19 January 2017 |access-date=20 January 2019 |language=es |trans-title=Porfirio Diaz Bridge, historical site |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801081314/https://www.moreloshabla.com/morelos/cuernavaca/puente-porfirio-diaz-sitio-historico-de-cuernavaca/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> The [[Bank of Morelos]] was founded in 1903.<ref name="elclima.com.mx"/>

In 1909, the anti-reelection movement was established in Cuernavaca, and by the end of this same year guerilla operations against the Diaz government were headed by [[Genovevo de la O]] in [[Santa María Ahuacatitlán]]. [[Emiliano Zapata]] took over the movement in the south and named De la O in charge of the Cuernavaca area. On 21 May 1911, Cuernavaca was evacuated by government troops, leaving the entire state in rebel hands. Professor Brunk, describing Zapata's triumph, writes "On the twenty-sixth, at 4 o'clock on a bright Friday afternoon, Zapata rode triumphantly into that city at the head of four thousand troops. Waving images of the Virgin of Guadalupe overhead, these revolutionaries were a ragged lot in the eyes of the urbane. But to the throngs who greeted them - the common people of Morelos, the young girls with armfuls of bougainvillea - they were conquering heroes."<ref name="houstonculture.org">{{cite web|url=http://houstonculture.org/mexico/morelos2.html|title=History of Mexico - The State of Morelos, Emiliano Zapata|website=houstonculture.org|access-date=3 December 2018|archive-date=6 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206011509/http://www.houstonculture.org/mexico/morelos2.html|url-status=live}}</ref> President [[Francisco I.

However, Zapata lost control of Cuernavaca on 2 May 1916 and was forced to return to guerilla warfare.<ref name="houstonculture.org"/>

Wealthy North Americans and Europeans established secondary residences in Cuernavaca and took long vacations there or frequently traveled back and forth, while servants maintained the haciendas in their absence. Sometimes, their offspring have made Cuernavaca their permanent residence, creating an enclave of natives with international roots bearing the influence of their cultures. For example, when the American designer, Michael van Beuren fled Germany with members of Bauhaus, where he was practicing his profession, he took up residence at the vacation hacienda of his parents in Cuernavaca, and stayed permanently, establishing his factory nearby and raising his family there. Others in his family began to reside there year 'round. Their children were natives of Mexico. {{YouTube|ANM-U91sj7A}}

After his installation as U.S. Ambassador to Mexico in 1927, American businessman [[Dwight Morrow]] established a weekend home in Cuernavaca on the street that today bears his name. It was here that his daughter Anne met famed aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]], whom Morrow had invited to Mexico. In celebration of his daughter's engagement to Lindbergh and to thank the people of Cuernavaca, in 1929 Morrow commissioned [[Diego Rivera]] to paint the mural "[[History of Morelos, Conquest and Revolution]]" at the Palacio de Cortes.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://memoriapoliticademexico.org/Biografias/MDW73.html | title=Memoria Política de México | access-date=3 December 2018 | archive-date=4 December 2018 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181204053801/https://memoriapoliticademexico.org/Biografias/MDW73.html | url-status=live }}</ref>

During the 1920s and 1930s, Cuernavaca became a place to vacation and gamble when the Hotel de la Selva was converted into the [[Casino de la Selva]], which attracted people such as [[Rita Hayworth]], [[Bugsy Siegel]], and [[Al Capone]] to Cuernavaca,{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} however, gambling was shut down by [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] in 1934. He is the same president who declared the area a ZPG (Forest Protection Zone). The casino hosted very important artistic works, including murals of Alvarez Icaza, Messeguer, and the architecture of Candela. The main vault was considered to be the "Mexican Sistine Chapel" by Nobel Prize author, Gabriel García Márquez.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

1936 was the year that Malcolm Lowry wrote his short story, "Under The Volcano", which inspired his 1947 novel of the same name. It has never gone out of print and was made into a [[Under the Volcano (1984 film)|movie]] in 1984. Cuernavaca, or Quaunahuac, as it is called in the novel, and the surrounding area, figure prominently in this great historical novel, where extensive details on Mexican history, culture, topography, and especially, politics and religion figure prominently. The recurrent artifacts are the twin volcanos, [[Popocatepetl]] and [[Iztaccihuatl]], and the barranca, symbols of division, death, and rebirth in the city of eternal spring.

Dr. [[Sergio Méndez Arceo]] became bishop of Cuernavaca in 1952. Mendez was known as a leading voice of ''Liberation Theology'' and he was a human rights activist.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/m/mendez_arcea.htm |title=Sergio Méndez Arceo |publisher=Biografias y Vidas |access-date=20 January 2019 |language=es |trans-title=Sergio Mendez Arceo |archive-date=13 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191113052043/https://www.biografiasyvidas.com/biografia/m/mendez_arcea.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1956, [[Erich Fromm]] founded the Sociedad Mexicana de Psicoanálisis and from his house in Cuernavaca promoted new ideas in the field of [[psychiatry]], incorporating [[Zen Buddhism]] and "communal psychoanalytic studies" (estudios psicoanalíticos comunitarios). This attracted many artists, composers, architects, and counterculture types here.<ref name="verdadera" /> In the 1960s, the city was one of the centers of the [[psychedelic movement]].{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} [[Timothy Leary]] tried [[psilocybin]] mushrooms there in the summer of 1960 and came back regularly to repeat the experience.

There was a riot in Cuernavaca in February 1957 after a police officer shot and killed Jorge Garrigós.<ref name="inafed.gob.mx">{{cite web |url=http://inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM17morelos/historia.html |title=Morelos:Historia |publisher=Enciclopedia de los Municipios y Delegaciones de Mexico |access-date=20 January 2019 |language=es |trans-title=Morelos:History |archive-date=29 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190129034834/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/enciclopedia/EMM17morelos/historia.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

In 1966, Austrian priest [[Ivan Illich]] founded the ''Centro Intercultural de Documentación'' (CIDOC) to teach Spanish language and culture to North American missionaries. This center was closed by order of the Vatican in 1969,<ref name="inafed.gob.mx"/> but several of the teachers continued elsewhere in the city, making Cuernavaca a leading center of Spanish-language teaching for foreigners.

More recently the city has seen a very active society dedicated to the preservation of its environment and cultural heritage. The ''Frente Civico'' which is now influential throughout the country, along with some 150 other organizations has promoted a boycott against [[Costco]] for having destroyed the Casino de la Selva to build a couple of warehouses. One of its members, Professor Jaime Lagunez, lobbied a general agreement in the national congress for the purpose of protecting its sixty archeological sites, its vegetation, historic center, and neighboring forests, among other important cultural aspects of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://es.scribd.com/document/322348956/Punto-de-Acuerdo |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 August 2016 |archive-date=13 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113075828/https://es.scribd.com/document/322348956/Punto-de-Acuerdo |url-status=live }}</ref> The ''Frente Civico'' received the 2004 National Mendez Arceo Human Rights Award for having protected the world cultural heritage found in the city.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}

===Morelos and Juárez Gardens===
[[File:JardinJuarez1.JPG|thumb|Juárez Garden]]
The Juárez and Morelos Gardens are in the center of the city, both of which are plazas lined with trees. Between the two is the State Government Palace, a three-story building with a [[tezontle]] façade built between 1955 and 1969. The Morelos Garden dates from 1908 and is easily recognizable by the large stone statue of José María Morelos, which is known colloquially as "Morelotes". The Juárez Garden is located to the north of the State Government Palace and is the oldest public square in Cuernavaca.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" /> The Garden contains a kiosk sometimes said to be designed by [[Gustave Eiffel]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://masdemorelos.masdemx.com/2017/12/cuernavaca-kiosko-jardin-juarez-disenador-gustave-eiffel/ |title=El kiosko del Jardín Juárez y su perfecta geometría: ¿sabes quién lo diseñó? |publisher=Mas de Morelos |date=4 December 2017 |access-date=20 January 2019 |language=es |trans-title=The Kiosk of the Juarez Garden and its perfect geometry: Do you know who designed it? |archive-date=3 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203104100/https://masdemorelos.masdemx.com/2017/12/cuernavaca-kiosko-jardin-juarez-disenador-gustave-eiffel/ |url-status=live }}{{cite web |url=http://www.moreloshabla.com/morelos/kiosko-de-cuernavaca-disenado-por-el-creador-de-la-torre-eiffel/ |title=Kiosko de Cuernavaca, diseñado por el creador de la torre Eiffel |publisher=Morelos Habla |access-date=20 January 2019 |language=es |trans-title=The Kiosk of Cuernavaca, Designed by the creator of the Eiffel Tower |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801125642/https://www.moreloshabla.com/morelos/kiosko-de-cuernavaca-disenado-por-el-creador-de-la-torre-eiffel/ |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|website=Diario de Morelos|location=Cuernavaca|title=Del cronista: El kiosco de Cuernavaca no es obra de Eiffel|date=14 July 2019|language=es|trans-title=From the chronicler: The Cuernavaca kiosk is not the work of Eiffel|url=https://www.diariodemorelos.com/noticias/del-cronista-el-kiosco-de-cuernavaca-no-es-obra-de-eiffel|access-date=19 November 2019|archive-date=29 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200729014144/https://www.diariodemorelos.com/noticias/del-cronista-el-kiosco-de-cuernavaca-no-es-obra-de-eiffel|url-status=live}}</ref> and brought from Britain toward the end of the 19th century.<ref name="finsemana" /> Unlike most main squares in Mexico, neither of these open up the way to the main cathedral. The main cathedral in Cuernavaca is located a few blocks west of the square.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" />

These two gardens or plazas are known colloquially as the "zócalo". Spectacles are often to be seen here and can include people dancing the "[[danzón]]" or other popular dances<ref name="finsemana" /> and "estudiantinas" dressed in colonial-era Spanish garb, playing instruments and dancing, and any number of free concerts. Often clowns perform on the zocalo as well, with balloons and tricks for the children and tell double-entendre jokes for the adults. Locals use the plazas to sell products such as honey, yogurt, traditional candies, and crafts. Street food such as corn on the cob, snow cones, candies, fruit smoothies, and more generally are available.<ref name="Taylor" />

===Cathedral===
[[File:FacadeCatCV2.JPG|thumb|left|Facade of [[Cuernavaca Cathedral|Cathedral]]]]

[[Cuernavaca Cathedral]] is the main church of what was the monastery of the Third Order of the Franciscans, called La Asunción, that dates back to the 16th century.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" /> It sits on the southeast corner of a large [[Atrium (architecture)|atrium]], which also contains a number of other chapels that were built at different times and with different architectural styles.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="finsemana" /> This complex is located at the intersection of Hidalgo and Morelos streets, a few blocks west of the town center.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" />

The cathedral was built by Cortés to double as a fortress, with cannons mounted above the [[buttress]]es.<ref name="wright" /> Over time, this church underwent a number of transformations, updating its interior. This was undone in the mid-20th century, when restoration work removed all the [[Neoclassical sculpture|Neoclassical]] altars and images. These now are stored in the cathedral's [[pinacotheca]] and not available to the public. Restoration work uncovered [[En plein air|al fresco]] murals on the lateral walls, relating to the martyrdom of [[Philip of Jesus]], the first Mexican canonized as a saint. The only other decoration inside this church now is a modern-style crucifix and an image of the [[Assumption of Mary]]. This restoration work was carried out by Bishop [[Sergio Méndez Arceo]].<ref name="finsemana" />

After the [[Reform War|Reform Laws]] in the 1860s, most of the monastery property passed into state, then private hands, leaving only what is now the cathedral and several smaller chapels on a very large atrium. The Revolution Garden was the orchard of the Cathedral,<ref name="finsemana" /> and the cloister with its observatory, is now the [[Robert Brady Museum]].<ref name="wright" /> The church became the Cathedral of Cuernavaca in 1891.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="mexdesmorelos" /><ref name="finsemana" />

[[File:Cuernavaca Catedral de madrugada.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Cathedral's side-chapel at sunset]]
Next to the cathedral is the "open chapel" (''capilla abierta'') of San José, which is an original structure built in the 16th century. It also was rescued and restored by Bishop Méndez Arceo and is one of the oldest constructions on the site. The building consists of a vault with three arches that face the atrium. These arches are supported by a pair of [[flying buttress]]es. Inside the arches is an altarpiece dating from the 17th century.<ref name="encmuc" /><ref name="finsemana" />

The main entrance is on Hidalgo Street, where one passes between two large chapels called the Chapel of Santa Cruz and the Chapel of the Tercera Orden. The Tercera Orden is considered to be the more valuable artistically of the two, with its highly sculpted early [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] main and side portals painted in various colors. Inside, there is a later [[Churrigueresque]] main altar. A third chapel, called the Chapel of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores is farther into the atrium and near the Open Chapel of San José.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" /> The bell tower was added in 1713. The cathedral was damaged during the [[2017 Puebla earthquake|September 2017 earthquake]], but it has since been restored.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.debate.com.mx/mexico/Se-reportan-danos-por-el-sismo-en-las-iglesias-de-Morelos-20170919-0379.html |title=Se reportan daños por el sismo en las iglesias de Morelos |publisher=Debate |date=19 September 2017 |access-date=20 January 2019 |language=es |trans-title=Churches in Morelos reported damaged in the earthquake |archive-date=3 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203104105/https://www.debate.com.mx/mexico/Se-reportan-danos-por-el-sismo-en-las-iglesias-de-Morelos-20170919-0379.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.milenio.com/cultura/en-cuernavaca-apuntalan-el-palacio-de-cortes-y-la-catedral |title=En Cuernavaca, apuntalan el Palacio de Cortés y la Catedral |publisher=Milenio |date=23 September 2017 |access-date=20 January 2019 |language=es |trans-title=In Cuernavaca, point to the Palace of Cortes and the Cathedral |archive-date=2 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190202173817/https://www.milenio.com/cultura/en-cuernavaca-apuntalan-el-palacio-de-cortes-y-la-catedral |url-status=live }}</ref>

*''El Calvario'' refers to two buildings just north of the Historic Center of Cuernavaca. The smaller is a ''chapitel'' (open-air chapel) built in 1538 at what was then the entrance to the city. It gets its name from the cross on top. There is a fountain in front called ''Fuente de los Leones'' or ''Fuente de las Ranas''. In 1772 the chapitel was dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe, and there is a large fair every 12 December.

===Teopanzolco===
[[Teopanzolco]] is an archeological site located just east of the historic downtown of Cuernavaca. Until recently its construction was dated to the year 1427, but new evidence revealed by 19 September 2017 earthquake suggests the original structure was built between 1150 and 1200 CE.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://globalnews.ca/news/4328145/earthquake-uncovers-hidden-temple-mexico/ |title=Earthquake uncovers hidden temple at Mexico's historic Teopanzolco pyramid |publisher=Global News |date=12 July 2018 |access-date=16 December 2018 |archive-date=30 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240130005021/https://globalnews.ca/news/4328145/earthquake-uncovers-hidden-temple-mexico/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/patrimonio/sismo-revela-estructura-en-piramide-de-teopanzolco |title=Sismo revela estructura en pirámide de Teopanzolco |website=www.eluniversal.com.mx |date=11 July 2018 |access-date=16 December 2018 |archive-date=17 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217014926/http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cultura/patrimonio/sismo-revela-estructura-en-piramide-de-teopanzolco |url-status=live }}</ref> Teopanzolco was an important ceremonial center during the 15th and 16th centuries when the native Tlahuicas were dominated by the Aztecs. The site shows significant Aztec influence. It has a large pyramidal base, called the ''Gran Basamento'', topped by two shrines, much like the [[Templo Mayor]] in [[Tenochtitlan]]. In fact, the new finds indicate that Teopanzolco predates the Templo Mayor and served as a model for the latter.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.excelsior.com.mx/expresiones/sismo-devela-huellas-prehispanicas-en-teopanzolco/1251823 |title=Sismo devela huellas prehispánicas en Teopanzolco |website=www.excelsior.com.mx |date=12 July 2018 |access-date=16 December 2018 |archive-date=30 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240130005022/https://www.excelsior.com.mx/expresiones/sismo-devela-huellas-prehispanicas-en-teopanzolco/1251823 |url-status=live }}</ref> Only the stone columns of these shrines remain today. The [[teocalli]], (sacred plaza) contains fourteen monuments including a circular altar dedicated to the wind deity [[Ehécatl]]. There are also two concentric structures separated by a moat or ditch. Both might have been dedicated to [[Quetzalcoatl]], the feathered-serpent deity, or to [[Tlāloc]], god or rain. The ruins were discovered during the ''Siege of Cuernavaca'' in 1914 as the ''Zapatistas'' used the heights to place their cannons.<ref>https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/earthquake-reveals-12th-century-temple-hidden-within-aztec-pyramid-180969619/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217062629/https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/earthquake-reveals-12th-century-temple-hidden-within-aztec-pyramid-180969619/ |date=17 December 2018 }} (16 December 2018)</ref>

===Borda Garden===
[[File:BordaHouseCourtyard.JPG|thumb|left|Borda House courtyard]]
The Borda Garden is located near the cathedral on Morelos Street. Originally, this was a house bought by [[José de la Borda]], the mining magnate of Taxco in the mid-18th century. Later, his son, Manuel de Borda y Verdugo, transformed the grounds of the house into gardens filled with flower and fruit trees to satisfy his passion for botany.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} These gardens also contain a number of fountains and an artificial lake that were completed in 1783. Today the complex contains an art gallery, offices, a restaurant, and an open-air theater. In 1865, this was the summer home of Emperor Maximilian I and his wife Carlota Amalia. Some sources say the emperor met his mistress, "La India Bonita", there, (although other sources say they met at his home called "El Olindo" in Acapantzingo.)<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/la-novia-indigena-del-emperador-maximiliano.html |title=La novia de 17 años del emperador Maximiliano |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |last=Huerta |first=Jose |date=17 May 2017 |access-date=21 January 2019 |language=es |trans-title=The 17-year old girlfriend of Emperor Maximilian |archive-date=3 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203152128/https://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/la-novia-indigena-del-emperador-maximiliano.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vmexicoalmaximo.com/articulos/personajes/maximiliano-y-carlota |title=Maximiliano y Carlota:La gran tragedia imperial |publisher=Mexico al Maximo |last=Suarez |first=Huberto |date=December 2014 |language=es |trans-title=Maximilian and Carlota: The great imperial tragedy |access-date=3 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170522144853/http://www.vmexicoalmaximo.com/articulos/personajes/maximiliano-y-carlota |archive-date=22 May 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  In the late 19th and early 20th centuries the Borda Garden sponsored soirees, such as those sponsored by Porfirio Díaz and Emiliano Zapata. Today the area is a public park where the gardens have been maintained and it is possible to take a short boat ride on the lake. The house has been converted into a museum. Six of its halls are dedicated to temporary exhibits while the other seven are devoted to recreating the characteristics of the 18th and 19th centuries.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" />

The Church of Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe is located next to the Borda Garden, and was constructed by Manuel de la Borda in 1784. It has a [[Baroque]] [[façade]] and what is considered to be the best [[cupola]] in the city. It was the royal chapel of Emperor Maximilian.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" /> The cupola was badly damaged in the earthquake of 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.diariodemorelos.com/noticias/se-cuartea-parroqu-de-nuestra-se-ora-de-guadalupe |title=Se cuartea parroquía de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe |publisher=Diario de Morelos |date=20 September 2017 |language=es |trans-title=Parish of Our Lady of Guadalupe is quartered |access-date=3 December 2018 |archive-date=3 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181203152036/https://www.diariodemorelos.com/noticias/se-cuartea-parroqu-de-nuestra-se-ora-de-guadalupe |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Robert Brady Museum===

[[File:CourtyardRBMusCV.JPG|thumb|Museum Courtyard]]
The [[Robert Brady Museum]] is on Nezahualcoyotl Street and occupies the building known as the ''Casa de la Torre'', originally part of the monastery of La Asunción.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" /> In 1960, it was purchased by the U.S. artist, [[Robert Brady (1928–1986)|Robert Brady]], who transformed it into his home and a private art and collectible museum.<ref name="wright" /> It contains a collection of art and crafts from around the world as well as the original ''[[Self-Portrait with Monkey]]'' painted by [[Frida Kahlo]]. Other works are by artists such as Miguel Cobarruvias, [[Pelegrí Clavé]], [[María Izquierdo (artist)|María Izquierdo]], and [[Rufino Tamayo]]. Non-Mexican paintings include those from North America and Europe. Other objects in the collection include antique furniture, African and Indian crafts, and archeological pieces.<ref name="finsemana" /> The collection occupies fourteen rooms of the old house, which has been kept mostly the way it was when Brady died in 1986 and bequeathed the house and its contents to the city.<ref name="wright" /><ref name="mexdesmorelos" />

===Tlaltenango===
[[File:Iglesia de Tlaltenango.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Atrium and façade of the Nuestra Señora de los Milagros Church]]
[[File:NaveMilagrosTlatenango.JPG|thumb|upright|right|interior of the Church of San Jose]]
Tlaltenango used to be a separate town, but now is a neighborhood of Cuernavaca city. The main attraction there is the church compound containing the Church of San José and the Church of Nuestra Señora de los Milagros de Tlaltenango. San José is one of the oldest churches in Mexico, built between 1521 and 1523. Two centuries later an image of the Virgin appeared to members of this village, prompting the building of the second church. This is the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora de los Milagros, which was built in 1730, with its bell towers built at the end of the 19th century.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" /><ref name="finsemana" />

===Hacienda Atlacomulco===
The Hacienda de San Antonio Atlacomulco is located south of the Cuernavaca and was established by Hernán Cortés as one of the first sugar plantations in Mexico. Descendants of the Conquistador held the property until the 19th century, when it became the property of [[Lucas Alamán]], who modernized the facility. The hacienda lost its surrounding properties during the [[Mexican Revolution]] and all that remains is the main house. After a long period of restoration and modification, the hacienda today houses an exclusive hotel, which can accommodate conventions and banquets.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" /><ref name="finsemana" />

===Museum of Traditional and Herbal Medicine and the Ethnicbotanical garden===
South of the city center is Acapantzingo, which had been a separate town, but now is part of the city. A large farm owned by Emperor Maximilian I existed there in the 1860s. It was named Olindo, referring to a character in the poem by [[Torquato Tasso]].<ref name="mexdesmorelos" /> The emperor used this property as one of his residences in Cuernavaca, and according to rumor, to enjoy the company of a certain beautiful Indian woman.<ref name="finsemana" /> On this farm and in what was the Pavilion, is now the Museum of Traditional and Herbal Medicine (Museo de Medicina Tradicional). The museum sponsors workshops and classes on the use of plants to make soap, cremes, dyes, decorative objects and more. Outside is the ethnicbotanical garden with exhibits including 800 species of plants organized by uses, such as the making of textiles, animal feed, condiments, ritual, and others.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" />

===Chapultepec Ecological Park===
The Chapultepec Ecological Park is located about four km southeast of the Cuernavaca city center. It contains fresh-water springs, which form the beginning of a river, and is surrounded by large trees called Chapultepec. It is a public park administered by the State Commission of Water and Environment. In addition to playgrounds, the park has constructed habitats for monkeys, birds, butterflies, crocodiles, reptiles, aquatic plants, and orchids. It also has a petting zoo, environmental museum, planetarium, house of terror, theater, and tour train. Beginning December 2018, Diana Ríos, a Mexican designer and artist working with the company ''Veneno Ríos'' is in charge of creating a new façade called "Metamorphosis" inspired in evolution and species changes as well as the love of nature in Morelos. Featured species are the ''cangrejito barranqueño'' (a crab), the ''carpita morelense'' (carp), and the ''amate amarillo'' (yellow fig tree).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.24morelos.com/mejoraran-imagen-del-parque-chapultepec-en-cuernavaca |title=Mejorarán imagen del Parque Chapultepec en Cuernavaca |publisher=24noticias |date=5 December 2018 |access-date=15 January 2019 |language=es |trans-title=Improve image of Chapultepec Park in Cuernavaca |archive-date=6 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181206102537/https://www.24morelos.com/mejoraran-imagen-del-parque-chapultepec-en-cuernavaca/ |url-status=live }}/</ref>

===Chapitel del Calvario===
[[File:InsideChapitelCV.JPG|thumb|left|Interior of the Chapitel del Calvario]]
[[File:ChapitelCV1.JPG|thumb|The Chapitel del Calvario]]
The Chapitel del Calvario is a church located at the corner of Morelos and Matamoros Streets, which was constructed in 1532. The word "chapitel" means "[[spire]]" as the church is named after two spires that define its appearance. It also has a fourteen-meter-high dome. It was constructed in the 16th century and was the last building encountered within Cuernavaca, as one left the city on the road to Mexico City. In 1772, this church was dedicated to the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]].<ref name="mexdesmorelos" /><ref name="finsemana" />

===El Castillito===
The ''Museo de Fotografía Antigua'', also known as ''El Castillito'' (the little castle), is located one block from the ''Chapitel del Calvario''. It is a very small, brick building that dates from the early 20th century when it was built as a home for the caretaker of the park that is next to the bridge built by [[Porfirio Diaz]]. It was later abandoned until Governor Vicente Estrada Cajigal remodeled it as his residence. Since 1986 it has been a small museum dedicated to antique photographs of the city of Cuernavaca.<ref name="mexdesmorelos" /><ref name="finsemana" /><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cuernavaca.gob.mx/turismo/?page_id=2463 |title=Museo Fotográfico de Cuernavaca (El Castillito) |publisher=Ayuntamiento de Cuernavaca 2016-2018 |access-date=15 January 2019 |trans-title=Photography Museum of Cuernavaca (The Little Castle |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160827011124/http://www.cuernavaca.gob.mx/turismo/?page_id=2463 |archive-date=27 August 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:WtrfllSanAntonCV.JPG|thumb|Inside the Salto de San Antón ravine]]
The Salto de San Anton is a large ravine with a thin but tall waterfall located in the neighborhood of ''San Anton Analco'' on the west side of Cuernavaca. The waterfall is {{convert|36|m|abbr=off}} high, with its water coming from a small tributary of the Zempoala River. The vertical walls of the ravine are of [[basalt]] and broad-leafed vegetation grows in nooks and crannies of the stone.

===Ravine of Amanalco Park / Barranca de Amanalco===
The ravines of Cuernavaca play a major role in regulating the climate of the city. One of the most important is the Ravine of Amanalco, which served as a natural defensive line for the city of Cuauhuanauc during the Spanish conquest of 1520, until Hernán Cortés managed to cross it where the modern "Puente del Diablo" is located.

The Ravine of Amanalco Park opened in the 1990s and features a 352-meter long walkway beginning at the Porfirio Díaz bridge and ending at the arches of a colonial-era aqueduct of Carlos Cuagila Street. It is a peaceful walk under dense foliage, and the only sounds you will hear are the birds and the running water.

One can view of the under area of the bridge, which was built at the end of the 19th century in order to connect the center of the city and the railway station via trolly.<ref name="cuernavaca.gob.mx">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cuernavaca.gob.mx/turismo/?page_id=2852 |title=Ayuntamiento de Cuernavaca |access-date=30 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181130210523/http://www.cuernavaca.gob.mx/turismo/?page_id=2852 |archive-date=30 November 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

===La Tallera David Alfaro Siqueiros / David Alfaro Siqueiros House & Studio===
The [[Casa Estudio La Tallera David Alfaro Siqueiros (La Tallera)|David Alfaro Siqueiros House and Studio]] in Cuernavaca, was donated to "the people of Mexico" by [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] (1896–1974). In the late fifties, Siqueiros was creating the mural ''Del Porfirismo a la Revolución'' (1957–66).  On 9 August 1960, this project was abandoned because he was charged with the crime of "social dissolution" and the muralist was imprisoned. When he left prison in 1964, Siqueiros finished the mural and built a house and workshop in the city of Cuernavaca. There, he lived and executed the mural ''La Marcha de la Humanidad'' (1971–73), currently located at the Polyforum Siqueiros.<ref>http://www.saps-latallera.org/saps/sample-page/historia/?lang=en {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404070852/http://www.saps-latallera.org/saps/sample-page/historia/?lang=en |date=4 April 2015 }} (16 December 2018).</ref><ref>https://www.mexicoescultura.com/recinto/65791/proyecto-siqueiros-la-tallera.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217062639/https://www.mexicoescultura.com/recinto/65791/proyecto-siqueiros-la-tallera.html |date=17 December 2018 }} (16 December 2018)</ref>

Neighborhood celebrations are held in Cuernavaca, mostly for patron saints, they include 15 May, the feast of San Isidro Labrador; 13 June, the feast of San Antonio in the neighborhood of San Antón, with Aztec dances; 6 August, the feast of the Savior or the Transfiguration in [[Ocotepec, Cuernavaca, Morelos|Ocotepec]], featuring the Moors and Christians dance, [[mole (sauce)|mole]], and [[pulque]]; 10 August the feast of San Lorenzo in Chamilpa; 15 August, the festival of the Assumption of Mary in Santa María Ahuacatilán; and 8 September, Festival of Nuestra Señora de los Milagros in Tlaltenango. Since 1965, the city Cuernavaca has had a [[carnival]] as well.<ref name="encmuc" />

The Huehuechis, a dance group, was started in Cuernavaca in 1870 by a group of young people. They dressed up in old boots and clothes, covering their faces with cloth, dancing sponteaneously in the streets with whistles and shouts. The name comes from a Nahuatl word for old, worn-out clothing. The event spread to other municipalities. It became popular enough among participants and spectators alike to be organized formally in 1871, when it became a traditional way to celebrate the days just before Lent, or the Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday of Carnival. The tradition spread to Tepoztlan, where it became even more famous after the people there modified the clothing worn, adding masks with beards and large mustaches. The dance there was renamed "[[Chinelos]]". This new version became a fixture at the carnaval of Yautepec and other towns in Morelos as well.<ref name="encmuc" />

CIDOC's lasting reputation was assured by its founding director [[Ivan Illich]], though it closed, "a victim of its own success", ten years later under right-wing political pressure.<ref name="CIDOC-Illich">{{cite news |last1=Todd |last2=La Cecla |title=Obituary: Ivan Illich |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/09/guardianobituaries.highereducation |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=15 February 2017 |first1=Andrew |first2=Franco |publisher=[[Guardian News & Media Limited]] |date=9 December 2002 |archive-date=9 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190909123053/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/dec/09/guardianobituaries.highereducation |url-status=live }}</ref> In the 1960s, the city became one of the centers of the psychedelic movement, attracting many artists, composers, and [[hippie]]s.

==Economy==
Most of the economic activity in the municipality is retail trade, concentrated in and around the city of Cuernavaca. Agriculture and fish farming employ the fewest people, although the municipality contains a good quantity of resources for these enterprises. The far north of the municipality generally is not suited to agriculture, due to the terrain and types of volcanic soil found there. Most agriculture is concentrated in the southeast. The lower elevations, at around {{convert|1,800|m|abbr=off}}, is best-suited for fishing and fish-farming. The middle range, between {{convert|1,800|and|2,100|m|abbr=off}}, has uses mixed between agriculture and forest products, and the elevations higher than {{convert|2,100|m|abbr=off}} are primarily forest. Fish farming areas are under pressure from urban development, especially in the Ahuatepec region east of the city, where irregular and sometimes illegal, housing developments are appearing among the farms.<ref name="encmuc"/>

On the outskirts of Cuernavaca, there are a handful of plant [[Plant nursery|nurseries]], specializing in the planting, growing and distribution, including international shipments, of plants, flowers and seeds. Many famous gardens around the world are supplied with flowers from the Cuernavaca region.

Industry is minimal and mostly limited to micro-industries such as printing, framing, ceramics, garment-making, and the production of cleaning supplies. This employs about 28% of the population. Most of the population (67%) is employed in the retail and service industries, both dependent on tourism.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Crafts from this area primarily consist of ceramics and [[wax]] products. The wax used is from bees and generally it is shaped into capricious figures. Flowerpots and clay objects from San Antón, handcrafted paper from wood chips with multicolored paintings, and wood lacquered masks are other products of the municipality.<ref name="encmuc"/>
