==History==
[[Mount Tsukuba]] has been a place of pilgrimage since at least the [[Heian period]]. During the [[Edo period]], parts of what later became the city of Tsukuba were administered by a junior branch of the [[Hosokawa clan]] at [[Yatabe Domain]], one of the [[han system|feudal domains]] of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. With the creation of the modern municipalities system after the [[Meiji Restoration]] on April 1, 1889, the town Yatabe was established within [[Tsukuba District, Ibaraki]].

Beginning in the 1960s, the area was designated for development. Construction of the city centre, the [[University of Tsukuba]] and 46 public basic scientific research laboratories began in the 1970s. Tsukuba Science City became operational in the 1980s. The [[Expo '85]] [[world's fair]] was held in the area of Tsukuba Science City, which at the time was still divided administratively between several small towns and villages. Attractions at the event included the {{Convert|85|m|ft|adj=on}} [[Technocosmos]], which at that time was the world's tallest [[Ferris wheel]].<ref>James W. Dearing (1995). Growing a Japanese Science City:  Communication in Scientific Research. London: Routledge.</ref>

On November 30, 1987 the town of Yatabe merged with the neighboring towns of Ōho and Toyosato (from [[Tsukuba District, Ibaraki|Tsukuba District]])) and the village of Sakura (from [[Niihari District, Ibaraki|Niihari District]]) to create the city of Tsukuba. The neighboring town of Tsukuba merged with the city of Tsukuba on January 1, 1988. Followed by the town of Kukizaki (from [[Inashiki District, Ibaraki|Inashiki District]]) on November 1, 2002. Therefore, Yatabe, Ōho, Toyosato, Sakura, Tsukuba and Kukizaki, correspond to the ancient towns and villages.

By 2000, the city's 60 national research institutes and two national universities had been grouped into five zones: higher education and training, construction research, physical science and engineering research, biological and agricultural research, and common (public) facilities. These zones were surrounded by more than 240 private research facilities. Among the most prominent institutions are the [[University of Tsukuba]] (1973; formerly Tokyo University of Education); the [[KEK|High Energy Accelerator Research Organization]] (KEK); the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology; the Electrotechnical Laboratory; the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory; and the [[National Institute for Materials Science]]. The city has an international flair, with about 7,500 foreign students and researchers from as many as 133 countries living in Tsukuba at any one time.

Over the past several decades, nearly half of Japan's public research and development budget has been spent in Tsukuba. Important scientific breakthroughs by its researchers include the identification and specification of the molecular structure of superconducting materials, the development of organic optical films that alter their electrical conductivity in response to changing light, and the creation of extreme low-pressure [[vacuum chamber]]s{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. Tsukuba has become one of the world's key sites for government-industry collaborations in basic research. Earthquake safety, environmental degradation, studies of roadways, fermentation science, microbiology, and plant genetics are some of the broad research topics having close public-private partnerships.

On April 1, 2007 Tsukuba was designated a [[Special cities of Japan|Special city]] with increased autonomy.

Following the [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents]] in 2011, evacuees from the accident zone reported that municipal officials in Tsukuba refused to allow them access to shelters in the city unless they presented certificates from the Fukushima government declaring that the evacuees were "radiation free".<ref>[[Jiji Press]], "Tsukuba asked evacuees for radiation papers", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 20 April 2011, p. 2.</ref>

On May 6, 2012, Tsukuba was struck by a [[tornado]] that caused heavy damage to numerous structures and left approximately 20,000 residents without electricity. The storm killed one 14-year-old boy and injured 45 people. The tornado was rated an F-3 by the [[Japan Meteorological Agency]], making it the most powerful tornado to ever hit Japan. Some spots had F-4 damage.<ref>{{cite web | title = Tornado in Tsukuba rated as strongest ever : National : DAILY YOMIURI ONLINE (The Daily Yomiuri) | url = http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120609002501.htm | access-date = 2012-06-10 | archive-date = 2012-06-15 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120615234055/http://www.yomiuri.co.jp/dy/national/T120609002501.htm | url-status = dead }}</ref>

==Government==
Tsukuba has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Tsukuba contributes five members to the Ibaraki Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Ibaraki 6th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
The local economy was traditionally based on rice production, and Tsukuba still has the largest area under [[paddy field]]s in Ibaraki Prefecture. After the establishment of Tsukuba Science City, the numerous government and private research institutes has drawn a large number of factories and supporting businesses.

===Tsukuba Science City===
Tsukuba Science City is a center for research and education in the city of Tsukuba, located northeast of [[Tokyo]]. The idea of constructing the science city was by the late [[Ichirō Kōno|Ichiro Kono]], former minister of construction, and Kuniomi Umezawa, former vice minister of the science and technology agency.<ref name="Bloom 1981">{{Cite journal|last1=Bloom|first1=Justin L.|last2=Asano|first2=Shinsuke|date=1981|title=Tsukuba Science City: Japan Tries Planned Innovation|journal=Science|volume=212|issue=4500|pages=1239–1247|jstor=1685782|doi=10.1126/science.212.4500.1239|pmid=17738819|bibcode=1981Sci...212.1239B}}</ref> Another key figure for the development of the Science City is [[Leo Esaki]].<ref name="Dearing 1995">{{Cite book|title=Growing a Japanese science city : communication in scientific research|last=W.|first=Dearing, James|date=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780203210581|location=London|oclc=647375233}}</ref> What sets Tsukuba apart from other town developments in Japan is the large scale and fast pace of its development into a place with high quality of scientific innovation.<ref name="Dearing 1995" />

==== History ====
In September 1963, the national government of Japan, led by Ichiro Kono and Kniomi Umezawa, ordered the development of a science city in the area around the mountain Tsukuba.<ref name="Bloom 1981" /> Reasons behind this decision included the overcrowding in Tokyo, the overflow of applicants to Japanese elite universities, a desire of conservative politicians to decrease the influence of liberal teachers and students, and a need to catch up with the West in terms of scientific knowledge.<ref name="Dearing 1995" /> Furthermore, it was already clear that there was a demand for new research facilities and a fresh approach to university education. This fresh approach was prevalent in the United States; therefore, Japan's Ministry of Education decided to transfer a part of the [[University of Tsukuba|Tokyo University of Education]] to the Tsukuba area. The campus of the university was modeled after the [[University of California, San Diego]], campus.<ref name="Dearing 1995" /> After a new university structure was introduced; the power of teachers decreased and the power of administrative management increased. Furthermore, the new structure led to better research facilities, a separate independent research department and the implementation of a board for general policies and regulations.<ref name="Bloom 1981" />

In 1966, after a few years of intensive study, the government started the project by buying land in the Tsukuba area.<ref name="Bloom 1981" /> The acquiring of land to build on was done by negotiation over prices between the government and landowners. The parcels of land with the most suitable price were purchased. This is reason for the odd shape of the government-owned land in Tsukuba; it is 18 kilometers long from north to east and 6 kilometers wide from east to west.<ref name="Bloom 1981" /> Due to this shape walking is not common in the city.<ref name="Dearing 1995" />

The building of facilities started in June 1969. The initial building plan was ten years, but in 1980 it became clear that that would not be the case. However, in March 1980 all the facilities that were meant to be built were up and running to a certain extent.<ref name="Bloom 1981" />

Between 1970 and 1980 researchers and their families started to move to Tsukuba. This move was a culture shock for the families from Tokyo due to the dirt roads and open fields in Tsukuba.<ref name="Dearing 1995" />

Initially, Tsukuba was built for travel by car due to having no train station. It was actually Japan's first city that promoted automobile travel over public transport.<ref name="Dearing 1995" /> In 2005, a train station was built in the city.<ref>{{Cite book|script-title=ja:データブック日本の私鉄 [Databook: Japan's Private Railways].|last=Terada|first=Hirokazu|publisher=Neko Publishing|year=2013|isbn=9784777013364|location=Japan|oclc=840099891}}</ref> The [[Tsukuba Express]] travels from Tokyo to the Science City in 45 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.japanvisitor.com/japan-travel/japan-transport/tsukuba-express|title=Tsukuba Express {{!}} JapanVisitor Japan Travel Guide|website=www.japanvisitor.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-30|archive-date=2018-11-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116215743/https://www.japanvisitor.com/japan-travel/japan-transport/tsukuba-express|url-status=live}}</ref>

'''Tsukuba Expo 1985'''

In order to promote the positive aspects of science and technology, an [[Expo 85 (Tsukuba, Japan)|International Science and Technology Exposition]] was held. This was a landmark for the science city. The reasons behind the expo were to establish a positive national image of Tsukuba Science City and to gain international recognition that Tsukuba was a place of science. The Expo attracted around 20 million Japanese and foreign visitors.<ref name="Dearing 1995" />

==== Leo Esaki ====
[[Leo Esaki]]  became the president of the University of Tsukuba in 1992.<ref name="Normile 1994">{{Cite journal|last=Normile|first=Dennis|date=1994|title=Leo Esaki: An Outsider Brings a Culture Change to Tsukuba|journal=Science|volume=266|issue=5190|pages=1473–1474|jstor=2885161|doi=10.1126/science.266.5190.1473|pmid=17841701|bibcode=1994Sci...266.1473N}}</ref> His presidency marked a new era of reform for the Tsukuba Science City. Leo Esaki is a Nobel prize winner and worked at [[IBM]] prior to becoming president of the University of Tsukuba. Unlike other Japanese university presidents he had no academic background and no former ties with the University of Tsukuba. This was part of the reason why he was chosen as president. Due to his history in the corporate world, he was able to create a climate were companies and graduate students could work together closely.<ref name="Normile 1994" /> When the university was founded a good relationship between the students of the university and the nearby companies was expected. However, over the years this ambition disappeared into the background.<ref name="Normile 1994" /> In these years there was a severe lack in interaction between the facilities of the University and the private companies in the area. This meant that there was no joint research happening.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=EDGINGTON|first=DAVID W.|date=1989|title=New strategies for technology development in Japanese cities and regions|journal=The Town Planning Review|volume=60|issue=1|pages=1–27|jstor=27798156|doi=10.3828/tpr.60.1.2348803u1n3m4324}}</ref> In July 1994, Esaki introduced Tsukuba Advanced Research Alliance (TARA). This is a partnership between the university, foreign researchers, Tsukuba's national research labs, and corporate laboratories based in the city.<ref name="Dearing 1995" />

==== Criticism ====
Tsukuba Science City has faced considerable criticism since its inception. The first criticism on the city was that it was not habitable. Wives of the first researchers were used to putting garbage on the side of the road in order for it to get picked up. However, this was not the case in the mid-1970s. Until that time only farmers had lived there and they would process their own garbage into mulch. Because the garbage did not get picked up, it started smelling in the streets. This enraged the housewives and they demanded a garbage service. In order to meet the demand, a pit was dug where the waste could be dumped until a garbage service would be developed in the city. In the 1990s, Tsukuba had the most innovative garbage system in Japan.<ref name="Dearing 1995" />

Another criticism levied by national government critics is that Tsukuba Science City is a waste of taxpayer's money. They also believe that Tsukuba is an example of government control of academic and research organization. In addition, social critics feel that Tsukuba's social organization is unfavorable as it lacks traditional Japanese culture.<ref name="Dearing 1995" />

Garner describes the city is described as being ‘flat’ due to a lack of city life.<ref name="Garner 2006">{{Cite journal|last=Garner|first=Cathy|date=2006|title=Viewpoint: Science Cities: refreshing the concept for 21 st-century places|journal=The Town Planning Review|volume=77|issue=5|pages=i–vi|doi=10.3828/tpr.77.5.1|jstor=41229022}}</ref> Even though Tsukuba Science City has an impressive number of research and development facilities and various companies, it still is not able to reach the same level of innovation as science cities that do have stimulating city life. In 2006, Tsukuba Science City started focusing on creating more city life to address this problem.<ref name="Garner 2006" />
