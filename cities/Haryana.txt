After the sack of [[Bhatner fort]] during the [[Timurid dynasty|Timurid]] conquests of India in 1398, [[Timur]] attacked and sacked the cities of [[Sirsa]], [[Fatehabad, Haryana|Fatehabad]], [[Sunam]], [[Kaithal]] and [[Panipat]]. When he reached the town of Sarsuti (Sirsa), the residents fled and were chased by a detachment of Timur's troops, with thousands of them being killed and looted by the troops. From there he travelled to Fatehabad, whose residents fled and a large number of those remaining in the town were massacred. The [[Ahirs]] resisted him at Ahruni but were defeated, with thousands being killed and many being taken prisoners while the town was burnt to ashes. From there he travelled to [[Tohana]], whose [[Jat]] inhabitants were robbers according to [[Sharaf ad-Din Ali Yazdi]]. They tried to resist but were defeated and fled. Timur's army pursued and killed 200 [[Jats]], while taking many more as prisoners. He then sent a detachment to chase the fleeing [[Jats]] and killed 2,000 of them while their wives and children were enslaved and their property plundered. Timur proceeded to Kaithal whose residents were massacred and plundered, destroying all villages along the way. On the next day, he came to [[Assandh]], whose residents were "[[Zoroastrians|fire-worshippers]]" according to Yazdi, and had fled to Delhi. Next, he travelled to and subdued Tughlaqpur fort and [[Salwan]] before reaching [[Panipat]] whose residents had already fled.

[[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]], also called [[Hemu]], claimed royal status and the throne of Delhi after defeating Akbar's Mughal forces on 7 October 1556 in the [[Battle of Delhi (1556)|Battle of Delhi]], and assumed the ancient title of [[Hemachandra Vikramaditya|Vikramaditya]]. The area that is now Haryana has been ruled by some of the major empires of India. [[Panipat]] is known for three seminal battles in the history of India. In the [[First Battle of Panipat]] (1526), [[Babur]] defeated the [[Lodi Empire|Lodis]]. In the [[Second Battle of Panipat]] (1556), [[Akbar]] defeated the local Haryanvi Hindu Emperor of Delhi, who belonged to [[Rewari]]. [[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]] had earlier won 22 battles across India from 1553 to 1556 from [[Punjab]] to [[Bengal]], defeating the Mughals and Afghans. Hemu had defeated Akbar's forces twice at Agra and the [[Battle of Tughlaqabad|Battle of Delhi]] in 1556 to become the last Hindu Emperor of India with a formal coronation at [[Purana Quila]] in Delhi on 7 October 1556.

===British Period===
The state was part of the British [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab province]]. The [[Punjab Province (British India)#Administrative divisions|Delhi division]] of Punjab province formed the bulk of Haryana. Among the princely states that were located in the state were [[Jind State|Jind]], [[Kalsia State|Kalsia]], [[Loharu State|Loharu]], [[Dujana]] and [[Pataudi State|Pataudi]], as well as parts of the [[Patiala State]].

===Partition and aftermath===
During the [[Partition of India]], the Punjab province was one of two British Indian provinces, alongside Bengal, to be partitioned between India and Pakistan. Haryana, along with other Hindu and Sikh-dominated areas of Punjab province, became part of India as [[East Punjab]] state. As a result, a significant number of Muslims left for the newly formed country of [[Pakistan]]. Similarly, a huge number of Hindu and Sikh refugees poured into the state from [[West Punjab]]. [[Gopi Chand Bhargava]], who hailed from Sirsa in present-day Haryana, became the first Chief Minister of East Punjab.

===Formation of Haryana===
{{Main|Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966}}
Haryana as a state came into existence on 1 November 1966 the Punjab Reorganisation Act (1966). The Indian government set up the Shah Commission under the chairmanship of Justice JC Shah on 23 April 1966 to divide the existing state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and determine the boundaries of the new state of Haryana after consideration of the languages spoken by the people. It encompassed the predominantly Hindi-speaking southern part of former Punjab, while the state of Punjab was reduced to the area where Punjabi speakers formed the majority population. The commission delivered its report on 31 May 1966 whereby the then-districts of [[Hisar (district)|Hisar]], [[Mahendragarh]], [[Gurgaon]], [[Rohtak]] and [[Karnal]] were to be a part of the new state of Haryana.

{{Main|Music of Haryana}}
Haryana has its own unique traditional [[Music of Haryana|folk music]], [[List of Indian folk dances#Haryana|folk dances]], [[saang]] (folk theatre),<ref name=harcu2>Sachchidananda'' Encyclopaedic Profile of Indian Tribes'' Volume 1 - 1996 817141298X p416.</ref> [[Haryanvi cinema|cinema]],<ref name=harcu1>{{cite news|last=Bhatia|first=Sheveta|title=Second Innings|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/second-innings/661605/|access-date=17 March 2011|newspaper=The Indian Express|date=17 August 2010|archive-date=24 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220424220013/https://indianexpress.com/news/second-innings/661605/|url-status=live}}</ref> belief system such as [[Punjabi folk religion#Jathera|Jathera]] (ancestral worship),<ref name=harcu3>{{cite web|url=http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journalfall04.html|title=Journal of Punjab Studies - Center for Sikh and Punjab Studies - UC Santa Barbara|website=global.ucsb.edu|access-date=4 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213237/http://www.global.ucsb.edu/punjab/journalfall04.html|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=harcu4>A Glossary of the tribes & castes of Punjab by H. A Rose</ref> and arts such as [[Embroidery of India#Phulkari (Punjab and Haryana)|Phulkari]] and [[Embroidery of India#Shisha or Mirrorwork (Gujarat, Haryana, Rajasthan)|Shisha]] embroidery.<ref name=harcu4/>

====Folk dances====
Folk music and dances of Haryana are based on satisfying the cultural needs of primarily [[agrarian society|agrarian]] and [[martial race|martial nature]]s of Haryanavi tribes.<ref name=harmu3/>

Haryanvi musical folk theatre's main types are [[Saang]], [[Raslila]] and [[Raga#Rāga-Rāgini system|Ragini]]. The Saang and Ragini form of theatre was popularised by [[Lakhmi Chand]].<ref name=harmu3>Manorma Sharma, 2007, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8131300463 Musical Heritage of India], Page 65-125.</ref>

Haryanvi folk dances and music have fast energetic movements. Three popular categories of dance are festive-seasonal, devotional, and ceremonial-recreational. The festive-seasonal dances and songs are [[Gogaji]]/[[Gugga]], [[Holi]], [[Phalgun|Phaag]], [[Shravana|Sawan]], [[Teej]]. The devotional dances and songs are [[Chaupai (poetry)|Chaupaiya]], [[Holi]], [[Taal (instrument)|Manjira]], [[Rasa lila|Ras Leela]], [[Raga#Rāga-Rāgini system|Ragini]]s). The ceremonial-recreational dances and songs are of following types: legendary bravery ([[Punjabi Qisse|Kissa]] and [[Raga#Rāga-Rāgini system|Ragini]] of male warriors and female Satis), love and romance ([[Pungi|Been]] and its variant [[Nāginī]] dance, and [[Raga#Rāga-Rāgini system|Ragini]]), ceremonial ([[Chang dance|Dhamal Dance]], [[Ghoomar]], [[Jhumar|Jhoomar]] (male), Khoria, Loor, and [[Raga#Rāga-Rāgini system|Ragini]]).<ref name=harcu3/>

==== Folk music and songs ====
Haryanvi folk music is based on day-to-day themes and injecting earthly humour enlivens the feel of the songs.<ref name=harcu3/> Haryanvi music takes two main forms: "Classical folk music" and "Desi Folk music" (Country Music of Haryana),<ref name=harmu1/> and sung in the form of ballads and love, valor and bravery, harvest, happiness and pangs of the parting of lovers.<ref name=harmu3/><ref name=harmu1>S. C. Bhatt and Gopal K. Bhargava, 2006, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=8178353652 Land and People of Indian States and Union Territories: 21 Arts and Crafts of Haryana].</ref><ref name=harmu2>S. Gajrani, 2004, [https://books.google.com/books?isbn=818205060X History, Religion and Culture of India], Volume 1, Page 96.</ref>

=====Classical Haryanvi folk music=====
Classical Haryanvi folk music is based on [[Indian classical music]].<ref name=harmu1/> [[Hindustani classical raga]]s, learnt in [[gharana]] [[parampara]] of [[guru–shishya tradition]], are used to sing songs of heroic bravery (such as [[Alha-Khand]] (1163–1202 CE) about the bravery of [[Alha|Alha and Udal]], [[Jaimal Rathore|Jaimal]] and [[Patta Sisodia|Patta]] of Maharana [[Udai Singh II]]), [[Brahma]]s worship and festive seasonal songs (such as [[Teej]], [[Holi]] and [[Phalguna|Phaag songs of Phalgun month near Holi]]).<ref name=harmu1/><ref name=harmu2/> Bravery songs are sung in high pitch.<ref name=harmu3/>

=====Desi Haryanvi folk music=====
[[Desi]] Haryanvi folk music, is a form of Haryanvi music, based on [[Bhairavi (Hindustani)|Raag Bhairvi]], [[Bhairav (raga)|Raag Bhairav]], [[Kafi (raga)|Raag Kafi]], [[Jaijaivanti|Raag Jaijaivanti]], [[Jhinjhoti|Raag Jhinjhoti]] and [[Raga|Raag Pahadi]] and used for celebrating community bonhomie to sing seasonal songs, [[ballad]]s, [[Religious music|ceremonial songs]] (wedding, etc.) and related religious legendary tales such as [[Puran Bhagat]].<ref name=harmu1/><ref name=harmu2/> Relationship and songs celebrating love and life are sung in medium pitch. Ceremonial and religious songs are sung in low pitch.<ref name=harmu3/> Young girls and women usually sing entertaining and fast seasonal, love, relationship and friendship-related songs such as [[Phalguna|Phagan]] (song for eponymous season/month), [[Kartik (month)|Katak]] (songs for the eponymous season/month), [[Shraavana|Samman]] (songs for the eponymous season/month), {{lang|bgc-Latn|bande-bandi}} (male-female duet songs), {{lang|bgc-Latn|sathne}} (songs of sharing heartfelt feelings among female friends).<ref name=harmu3/> Older women usually sing devotional Mangal Geet (auspicious songs) and ceremonial songs such as [[Bhajan]], Bhat (wedding gift to the mother of bride or groom by her brother), [[Punjabi wedding traditions#Sagai|Sagai]], [[Hindu wedding|Ban]] (Hindu wedding ritual where pre-wedding festivities starts), [[Childbirth in India|Kuan-Poojan]] (a custom that is performed to welcome the birth of a child by worshiping the well or source of drinking water), [[Sanjhi]] and Holi festival.<ref name=harmu3/>

===== Socially normative-cohesive impact =====
Music and dance for Haryanvi people is a way of lessening societal differences as folk singers are highly esteemed and they are sought after and invited for events, ceremonies and special occasions regardless of their caste or status. These inter-caste songs are fluid in nature, and never personalised for any specific caste, and they are sung collectively by women from different strata, castes, and dialects. These songs transform fluidly in dialect, style, words, etc. This adoptive style can be seen in the adoption of tunes of Bollywood movie songs into Haryanvi songs. Despite this continuous fluid transforming nature, Haryanvi songs have a distinct style of their own as explained above.<ref name=harmu3/>

With the coming up of a strongly socio-economic metropolitan culture in the emergence of urban Gurgaon Haryana is also witnessing community participation in public arts and city beautification. Several landmarks across Gurgaon are decorated with public murals and graffiti with cultural cohesive ideologies and stand the testimony of a lived sentiment in Haryana folk.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Artists-give-Gurgaons-walls-a-makeover/articleshow/51552667.cms|title=Artists give Gurgaon's walls a makeover|date=25 March 2016|first=Pratyush|last=Patra|website=The Times of India|access-date=6 November 2019|archive-date=9 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209170004/https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/Artists-give-Gurgaons-walls-a-makeover/articleshow/51552667.cms|url-status=live}}</ref>

Wheat rotis are ubiquitous, along with the popular baajre ki roti. In the past, rotis were commonly made from a blend of wheat, gram, and barley flour, offering a nutritious and wholesome combination. Another notable variety is the gochini atta, crafted from wheat and gram flour.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Corporation |first=Haryana Tourism |title=Cuisine of Haryana {{!}} About us {{!}} Haryana Tourism Corporation Limited. |url=https://haryanatourism.gov.in/cuisine-of-haryana |access-date=4 April 2024 |website=haryanatourism.gov.in |language=en-IN |archive-date=10 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171210183724/http://haryanatourism.gov.in/cuisine-of-haryana |url-status=live }}</ref> Haryana is renowned for its abundant livestock, including the famed Murrah buffalo and the  Haryana cow. This cattle wealth ensures a plentiful supply of milk and dairy products in Haryanvi cuisine. Many households produce their own butter and ghee, which are generously incorporated into daily meals. Fresh homemade butter, known as "nooni" or "tindi ghee," is commonly churned on a daily basis. When a girl becomes a mother, it's customary for her family to present her with gifts of ghee, edible gum (gondh), laddus (sweetmeats made from gram flour), and dry fruits. Buttermilk, known as "chaaj," is a popular beverage and serves as an instant refresher during the summer months. Lassi, made from yogurt, is another beloved drink that can almost constitute a meal in itself. The Haryanvi fondness for lassi is evident in the fact that "thandai," a sweet milk-based drink, is referred to as "kachi lassi" in Haryana.<ref name="Corporation"/>

===Society===

[[Haryanvi people]] have a concept of inclusive society involving the ''"36 Jātis"'' or communities. Castes such as [[Jat]], [[Rajput]], [[Gurjar]], [[Saini]], [[Pasi (caste)|Pasi]], [[Ahirs]], [[Ror]], [[Meo (ethnic group)|Meo]], [[Charan]], [[Bishnoi]], [[Harijan]], [[Aggarwal]], [[Brahmin]], [[Khatri]] and [[Tyagi]] are some of the notable of these 36 Jātis.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sāṅgavāna |first1=Guṇapālasiṃha |title=Harayāṇavī lokagītoṃ kā sāṃskr̥tika adhyayana |date=1989 |publisher=Hariyāṇā Sāhitya Akādamī |page=17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubI3AAAAIAAJ|language=hi}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ijmra.us/project%20doc/2017/IJRSS_NOVEMBER2017/IJMRA-12670.pdf|title=Social study the KhapPanchayats of Haryana: A Survey, International Journal of Research in Social Sciences Vol. 7 Issue 11|publisher=Open J-Gage as well as in Cabell's Directories of Publishing Opportunities, U.S.A|access-date=31 December 2019|archive-date=31 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731122151/https://www.ijmra.us/project%20doc/2017/IJRSS_NOVEMBER2017/IJMRA-12670.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>
