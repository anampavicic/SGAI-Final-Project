'''Ica''' ({{IPA|es|ˈika}}) ([[Quechuan languages|Quechua]]: ''Ika'') is a city and the capital of the [[Department of Ica]] in southern [[Peru]]. While the area was long inhabited by varying cultures of [[indigenous people]]s, the Spanish ''[[conquistador]]'' [[Jerónimo Luis de Cabrera]] claimed its founding in 1563.

As of the [[2017 Peru Census|2017 census]], it had a population of over 282,407. The city suffered extensive damage and loss of life during the [[2007 Peru earthquake]].

== History ==
[[File:Ica in 1615 by Guamán Poma.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Ica in 1615, by [[Felipe Guaman Poma de Ayala|Guamán Poma]]]]

In 2007, researchers found the fossil remains of a prehistoric penguin, ''[[Icadyptes salasi]]'', which inhabited the [[Atacama Desert]] about 30 million years ago.  Scientists estimate it was about {{convert|4.5| or |5|ft|cm|0|abbr=out}} tall, with a {{convert|1|ft|cm|1|adj=mid|-long}} beak.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/photogalleries/giant-penguins/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070628185302/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/06/photogalleries/giant-penguins/|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2007|title=Photo Gallery: Giant Prehistoric Penguins Found|last=Minard|first=Anne|date=25 June 2007|publisher=National Geographic}}</ref>

Evidence of prehistoric [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] civilizations has been found in the nearby deserts, such as that of [[Paracas culture|Paracas]].  Other cultures include the [[Chincha people|Chincha]] and the [[Inca]], the latter of whom ruled this area beginning in the 14th century. Numerous pre-Columbian [[archeological artifacts]] are now displayed in the ''[[Regional Museum of Ica "Adolfo Bermúdez Jenkins"|Museo Regional de Ica]]''.

The Inca were still in power when the Spanish conquistadors invaded the territory. The Spanish colonial city was founded on 17 June 1563 by Gerónimo Luis de Cabrera as ''Villa de Valverde''. It was ruled by Spain under colonial rulers until Peru achieved independence in 1821.

On 15 August 2007, a [[2007 Peru earthquake|magnitude 8.0 earthquake]] occurred off the coast of Peru, severely damaging buildings, houses and infrastructure in Ica. Initially 17 people died and 70 were killed when a church collapsed. [[Pisco, Peru|Pisco]] was even more severely damaged and many people were buried under buildings that had collapsed. Some 80% of the city's buildings were destroyed.<ref>James Gancer [https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070816/ap_on_re_la_am_ca/peru_quake], [https://web.archive.org/web/20070816064242/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/americas/08/16/peru.earthquake/index.html]</ref>

== Geography ==
The city is located on the [[Ica River]] about {{convert|300|km|abbr=on}} to the south of [[Lima]], along the desert coast of southern Peru. Further south along the [[Pan-American Highway]] lies the city of [[Nazca]].
=== Climate ===

Ica lies on the border of the Atacama desert and has one of the driest climates in the world [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh'', with only around 1 centimetre of rainfall for the whole year. Temperatures are hot during the summer months (December – March) and warm through the winter months (June – September).

== Transportation ==
Ica can be reached from [[Lima]] by the [[Pan-American Highway]], a journey of {{convert|320|km}}.

The [[Tren de la Costa (Peru)|Tren de la Costa]] is planned.

Ica and surrounding areas are the traditional source of [[Pisco]] brandy. Ica is the site of the ''Museo Regional de Ica'', a regional museum with exhibits ranging from prehistoric artifacts to the Spanish colonial era. On display are [[pre-Columbian]] funerary bundles and [[mummies]]. The elongated skulls from the [[Paracas culture|Paracas]] and pre-Inca cultures suggest ritual deformation, perhaps to mark an elite class. Some skulls also bear evidence of [[trepanning]], a kind of early brain surgery to relieve internal pressure or remove damaged skull matter suffered in battle.

A collection of furniture, paintings and artifacts date from the Spanish [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial]] era.

The Department of Ica encompasses considerable desert, giving it unique opportunities for tourism. The nearby [[Huacachina]] oasis is located in the midst of sand dunes. The city of Ica attracts international travelers, as well as resort seekers from Peru. Some young visitors try sandboarding; others travel the dunes in sand buggies.
== Agriculture ==
The many days of sunshine have made Ica the center of an important agricultural region.  Commodity crops are [[cotton]], [[grape]]s, [[asparagus]], [[avocado]], [[mango]], [[olive]]s and other produce. It is known by Peruvians as the "Land of Eternal Sun".

Although the area has four seasons, the climate is warm and dry. Visitors say that it feels like a northern summer year-round. The climate of the city can help in easing [[asthma]], which is aggravated by damp and humid climates and their associated [[allergens]].

The desert city has drawn water for domestic and agricultural needs from an aquifer fed by glacial melt water. The regional usage is exceeding the inflow of water into the aquifer.  Because the aquifer is quickly drying up, activists have called for more efficient irrigation, or adding dams and water diversions.<ref>{{cite news
