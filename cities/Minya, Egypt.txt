'''Minya'''<ref group="spelling">Also spelled '''''[[definitive article|el]]...''''' or '''''al...''''' '''''...Menia''', '''...Minia''''' or '''''...Menya'''''<span style="margin-left:1px">.</span></ref> ({{langx|ar|المنيا}}&nbsp; {{IPA|arz|elˈmenjæ|}}; {{Langx|cop|ⲧⲙⲱⲛⲏ|translit=tmōnē}}) is the capital of the [[Minya Governorate]] in [[Upper Egypt]]. It is located approximately {{convert|245|km|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Cairo]] on the western bank of the [[Nile River]], which flows north through the city.

Minya has one of the highest concentration of [[Coptic Christians]] in [[Egypt]] (approximately 50% of total population).<ref>''Al-Ahram'', Issue No.43948, 4 April 2007</ref> It is the home city of the [[Minya University]], [[Suzanne Mubarak]] Center for Arts, the new Minya Museum, and the regional North of Upper Egypt Radio and Television.

==Etymology==
{{hiero|Mnꜥt ḫwfw<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gauthier |first1=Henri |title=Dictionnaire des Noms Géographiques Contenus dans les Textes Hiéroglyphiques Vol. 3 |date=1926 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/Gauthier1926/page/n21 36]-37 |url=https://archive.org/details/Gauthier1926}}</ref>|<hiero>Y5:N35-D36:X1-B6</hiero><hiero><-Aa1:D43-I9-G43->-O49:X1*Z1</hiero>|align=right}}

The city's Arabic name comes from the Coptic, rendered in as ⲧⲙⲱⲛⲏ in [[Bohairic]] and ⲧⲙⲟⲟⲛⲉ in [[Sahidic]], which in turn came from {{Langx|grc|μονή|lit=stopping-place, station, monastery}}.<ref name=":02">{{Cite web |last=Peust |first=Carsten |title=Die Toponyme vorarabischen Ursprungs im modernen Ägypten |url=http://www.peust.de/ortsnamen_original.pdf |page=65}}</ref>

The modern city of Minya is often identified with the Ancient Egyptian settlement of Men'at Khufu based on the resemblance of two names, although this claim, proposed by [[Henri Gauthier|Gauthier]] and Drew-Bear, is denied by modern Egyptology as the former has a clear Greek etymology.<ref name=":02" />

Minya is dubbed by the locals "Bride of [[Upper Egypt]]", in reference to its strategic location in [[Middle Egypt]] as a vital link between the north and the south of [[Egypt]].

==History==

===Earliest history===

During the [[Predynastic Period]] (before 3100 BC), the area encompassing modern day Minya and its surrounding lands formed the 16th [[nome (Egypt)|nome]] (district).  It remained an autonomous city-state until the ruler [[Menes]] unified Egypt around 3100 BC. At the time of its unification, Egypt was divided into 42 nomes. The 16th nome was also called the [[Oryx nome]], probably due to the prevalence of the Oryx, one of the [[antelope]] species that inhabited the area.

===Ancient Egyptian===

[[File:Middle Egypt Nomes.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Nomes of [[Middle Egypt]]]]

After the unification of Egypt, the provincial capital of the 16th nome emerged as an important center of trade. It was opposite a trade route to the [[Red Sea]] along which the Levantine traders carrying their goods from [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and [[Canaan]] travelled.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Trudy Ring |author2=Robert M. Salkin |author3=Sharon La Boda |title= International Dictionary of Historic Places|isbn= 978-1-884964-03-9|location=London|publisher= Taylor & Francis|year=1996|pages=123}}</ref>

Following the collapse of the [[Old Kingdom]], and during the [[First Intermediate Period]], rulers of Oryx became wealthy and powerful and enjoyed a certain degree of autonomy in relation to the central power of [[Pharaoh]]s. The princes of the nome initially remained neutral during the long struggle that dominated the First Intermediate Period between the [[Herakleopolis Magna|Herakleopolitan]] and [[Luxor|Theban]] kingdoms, but eventually during the reign of [[Baqet III]] they formed an alliance with the Thebans in the time of [[Mentuhotep II]]. This pro-Theban policy worked to their advantage in that power over the Oryx nome continued to be wielded by the same family after the Theban conquest. The power of the rulers of the Oryx nome reached its height during the [[11th Dynasty]].<ref>{{cite book|author= Nicolas Grimal|title= A History of Ancient Egypt|isbn= 0-7607-0649-2|location=New York|publisher= Barnes & Noble Books|year=1997|pages=144}}</ref>

[[File:ibscha.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A group of Asiatic people (perhaps the future Hyksos) depicted entering Egypt c. 1900 BC from the tomb of a 12th dynasty official Khnumhotep under pharaoh [[Senusret II]] at [[Beni Hasan]].]]Like Pharaohs, rulers of the Oryx [[nome (Egypt)|nome]] were deeply concerned with their lives after death. Because the pyramid building age was over or maybe because they could not afford to construct their own pyramids, they chose the limestone cliffs of the eastern desert overlooking a gentle curve in the [[Nile]] as an ideal spot on which to carve their tombs. These chapel-tombs at [[Beni Hasan]] are the only remnant of the era. Today these thirty nine rock-cut tombs can be visited in the limestone cliffs above the modern day village of [[Beni Hasan]]. Though not as great and magnificent as other monuments of [[ancient Egypt]], the Beni Hasan tombs are extremely important as their walls reveal more information about life in Egypt 4,000 years ago more than any other monument in Egypt. In fact these tombs provide more insight about daily life in Egypt than about the rulers who constructed them.

With the rise of the [[12th Dynasty]], the powers of Oryx rulers were forcibly reduced by the [[Pharaoh]] [[Amenemhat II]] (1929–1895 BC). By the end of the 12th Dynasty, the role and the power of the nome were functionally eliminated.

During the [[Second Intermediate Period]], Oryx with the rest of Lower and Middle Egypt fell under the control of the [[Hyksos]]. It appears that Oryx's rulers actually supported the Hyksos [[Fifteenth dynasty of Egypt|15th Dynasty]] rulers against the native Egyptian pharaohs of the [[Sixteenth dynasty of Egypt|16th]] and [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|17th dynasties]]. Towards the end of the Second Intermediate Period when the Theban Pharaohs started their struggle to expel the Hyksos out of Egypt, Oryx nome was the site where the first major battle of this conflict took place. In 1552 BC, [[Kamose]], the last Pharaoh of the [[Seventeenth dynasty of Egypt|17th dynasty]] marched his [[Medjay]] troops north to [[Nefrusy]] few miles to the south of Minya and there he defeated the army of a man called [[Teti son of Pepi]], who is said to have transformed Oryx into a "nest of the Asiatics". This was the first major defeat for the Hyksos which later would encourage [[Ahmose I]], the younger brother of [[Kamose]], to march north and expel the Hyksos out of Egypt for good around 1540 BC.<ref>{{cite book|author= Nicolas Grimal|title= A History of Ancient Egypt|isbn= 0-7607-0649-2|location=New York|publisher= Barnes & Noble Books|year=1997|pages=191}}</ref>

As for the Beni Hasan tombs, most of them were later ravaged. Some were defaced by rulers that followed. Mutilation of the tomb chamber was the fate of many monuments during the centuries following the demise of [[Pharaonic Egypt]]. Tombs were converted into dwellings, quarried as a ready source of stone, or deliberately damaged by early [[Christians]] and [[Muslims]].<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Kathryn A.

===Greco-Roman history===

During the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom|Ptolemaic Era]] [[Middle Egypt]] was settled extensively by Greek settlers and hosted settlements with populations of 20,000 to 40,000 ''inhabitants''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ig4uQC20_IC&pg=PA155|title=Egypt from Alexander to the Early Christians: An Archaeological and Historical Guide|last=Bagnall|first=Director of the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World Roger S.|date=2004|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=9780892367962|language=en}}</ref> Following the [[Roman conquest of Egypt]] Minya became a hub of [[Egyptian cotton]] trade and was inhabited by Greek and Roman cotton barons and traders.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ws8oxhy66ocC&pg=PA50|title=A Widow's Egyptian Adventure|last=Vansant|first=Emily Del Rosario|date=2006-06-27|publisher=AuthorHouse|isbn=9781467812399|language=en}}</ref>

[[El Ashmunein]] ([[Hermopolis|Hermopolis Magna]]) was the capital of the region during this period. It was the main center of worship of the god [[Thoth]]. Today, the ruins of a Greek [[temple]], similar to the [[Parthenon]], can be still found.

The [[Tuna el-Gebel#Tomb of Petosiris|tomb and chapel of Petosiris]] are found near the modern village of [[Tuna el-Gebel]]. [[Antinopolis|Antinoöpolis]] was built in 130 [[Anno Domini|A.D.]] by the [[Roman emperor]] [[Hadrian]] in memory of his ''eromenos'' [[Antinous]], who drowned on the banks of the Nile river and was considered a God following Egyptian tradition. The new city was built on a long-''established'' site and Hadrian repopulated it with Greeks from other parts of Egypt.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKDpAAAAMAAJ|title=Egypt: From Alexander to the Copts : an Archaeological and Historical Guide|last1=Bagnall|first1=Roger S.|last2=Rathbone|first2=Dominic|date=2004|publisher=British Museum Press|isbn=9780714119526|language=en}}</ref>

===Byzantine history===

The [[Monastery of the Virgin Mary at Gebel el-Teir]] is an important [[Christians|Christian]] site near the city of [[Samalut]]. Its church was built by [[Helena of Constantinople|Empress Helena]], mother of [[Constantine I (emperor)|Constantine the Great]], in 328, on one of the sites where the [[Holy Family]] is believed to have stayed during its [[Flight into Egypt]].

[[Oxyrhynchus]] was an important administrative center during the [[Hellenistic Period]], and remains an important archaeological source for [[papyri]] from the [[Byzantine]] [[Egypt]].

===Arab history===

[[File:El Amarawy.jpg|thumb|200px|right|El-Amrawy Mosque, built in the 11th Century, an outstanding example of Fatimid Islamic architecture of the time, with a remarkable structural and decorative use of stonemasonry]]During the rule of the [[Abbasids]], Minya's name became attached to [[Ibn Khasib]], the appointed benevolent and almost legendary ruler of Egypt in the early 9th century. Ibn Khasib loved Minya so much that when was asked by the [[Caliph]] to name a reward for his good deeds, he chose Minya where he would retire and die few years later. Ibn Khasib is credited for expanding Minya and transferring it from a large village to a robust [[Middle Ages|Medieval]] city. Since Ibn Khasib years, Minya has been referred to as ''Munyat ibn Khasib'' (Ibn Khasib's Minya). During the rule of the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] in the 10th and 11th centuries, Minya continued to expand and it included large mosques, schools, a bazar, and public baths. It was during this period that two landmarks of Minya, the EL-Lamaty and EL-Amrawy mosques, were built. In 1326, [[Ibn Battuta]], the famous medieval travellar, visited Minya and was impressed by what he saw there. Minya was noted and regarded with high praise in Ibn Battuta's account of his travels called ''[[The Rihla]]'' because of the school it used to have when he visited the city. Ibn Battuta's described Minya as a town that "excels all the other towns of Upper Egypt."<ref>{{cite book|author= Ibn Battuta|title= The Travels of Ibn Battuta in the Near East, Asia and Africa|isbn= 978-1-61640-262-4|location=New York|publisher= Cosimo|year=2009|pages=14–16}}</ref>

===Modern history===

[[File:Architecture Minya.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A Rococo facade of a palace in Colonial Minya]]During [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]]'s rule, Minya gained importance due to its fertile lands and its large agricultural production. The importance of the City increased during the reign of [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail]] who owned large cotton and sugar cane plantations around Minya.  Ismail constructed a royal residence in Minya and beginning with 1870 he started modernizing the city and constructed its first residential extensions. In the year 1873, the [[Ibrahimiya Canal]] was built to provide perennial irrigation to Ismail's vast lands. The canal led to a noticeable development in the urban growth especially in the western areas of the city. Improvement of the transportation network, particularly the introduction of the building of bridges across the Ibrahimiya, permitted developments of housing to grow haphazardly on private agricultural lands of the west suburban banks of the canal.

With the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, Egyptian [[cotton]] became an expensive commodity that was in high demand. Minya, which produced large quantities of high quality cotton benefitted from this high demand for its cottons. The influx of wealth created a new wealthy upper class that consisted of native land lords, senior officials and merchants. Confident about their status, the wealthy families took residence at what would become known later as the Colonial part of the city (the area roughly bounded by Abd el Al el Garhy Street in the south and Port Said Street in the north). There they built palaces and high-end houses that were designed by Italian architects who borrowed decorative features from Classical and [[Rococo]] architecture in addition to western-type apartment houses.<ref>{{cite book|author= Emad El Din Aly|title=Visual Design Guidelines For Medium-sized Cities, the Case of El-Minya City-Egypt|location=Stuttgart|publisher= Städtebau-Institut, Universität Stuttgart|year=2003|pages=87}}</ref>

[[File:Minyeh (Minyâ). Vue de la ville et de la chaine arabique, prise du couchant (NYPL b14212718-1268715).jpg|thumb|Minya in c.1800]]
Around the start of the 20th century, land speculations and a general building boom marked the beginning of Minya's dramatic 20th-Century expansion. In the beginning of the century, the establishment of the railway to join Cairo began. Later, the city extended east and west on the railway sides, which penetrated the current city. By that time, Great Britain established a consulate in Minya mainly to promote cotton trade. In 1907, the [[Ottoman Bank]] opened a branch in the city in recognition of its increasing economic importance.  Utilities, serving mainly the new developments, were introduced under long-term franchises granted to foreign enterprises: a courthouse in 1927, the fire department in 1931, the city council and the administration building in 1937. The wide paved streets of the modern city diverted commercial activity away from the old city, hastening its deterioration.<ref>{{cite book|author= Emad El Din Aly|title=Visual Design Guidelines For Medium-sized Cities, the Case of El-Minya City-Egypt|location=Stuttgart|publisher= Städtebau-Institut, Universität Stuttgart|year=2003|pages=88}}</ref>

Following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952|revolution of 1952]], the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 and the subsequent nationalization of many industries from 1957, the vast majority of Greek and Armenian communities of Minya left Egypt. This led to the beginning of the decline for the colonial district. During this period, the internal population movements further accentuated disparities between the two parts of the city: the old city with its legacy of obsolescence and poverty, and the colonial district with its modern buildings and services. Densities continued to increase in the old city, where there were inadequate community facilities. The resultant overcrowding accelerated deterioration of both infrastructure and the standing housing stock.

In the 1960s, Ard AL-Mowled was developed as a public housing scheme to accommodate the exploding population growth of lower income residents of the old city. Around the beginning of the 1970s, the modern district of Ard Sultan began to be established according to land subdivision and zoning laws.  Because of the high land price in the area, it attracted upper and middle-income groups who left the deteriorating colonial city. Ard Sultan was carved in by a number of new urban corridor streets, which were complemented by a system of perpendicular and circular roads. These main new axes are parallel to the Nile River and bordered by freestanding buildings with heights of up to 30 metres. The north–south access of Taha Hussein Street formed a new linear central area that was intended to represent modern Minya.

=== Archaeology ===
The [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[Codex Tchacos]], noted for containing the [[Gospel of Judas]], was discovered near Minya during the 1970s beside three ancient books in a limestone box.<ref>{{cite book|editor=Paul Foster|title=The Non-Canonical Gospels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIKGDAAAQBAJ|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]|chapter=8|date=Sep 11, 2008|isbn=9780567202826 |access-date=2022-04-03}}</ref>

In February 2019, fifty mummy collections wrapped in linen, stone coffins or wooden sarcophagi dated back to the [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] were discovered by Egyptian archaeologists in the [[Tuna el-Gebel|Tuna El-Gebel]] site. 12 of the graves in four burial chambers 9&nbsp;m (30&nbsp;ft) deep, belonged to children.

==Economy==
[[File:Limestone Quarry 8.jpg|thumb|Limestone quarry]]
The public sector predominates in industry, controlling most of the production of capital and intermediate goods. Among the state-run industries are cement, chemicals, mining, fertilizers and agricultural industries. The private sector is active in manufacturing of consumer goods, particularly in small enterprises in and around the city. The principal private industries are food products, furniture, and metal and woodworking. Although rich in history, tourism plays a trivial role in the economy of Minya.

==Climate==

[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (BWh). [[Luxor#Climate|Luxor]], Minya, [[Sohag#Climate|Sohag]], [[Qena#Climate|Qena]] and [[Asyut#Climate|Asyut]] have the widest difference of temperatures between days and nights of any city in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]], with almost {{convert|16|C-change}} difference. The city of Minya is located tightly between two ranges of about {{convert|500|m|abbr=on}}-mountains on both western and eastern sides, and falls away from the [[Mediterranean]] Sea and the [[Red Sea]], thus giving the city a significant temperature difference between summer and winter.

During summertime, temperatures could reach {{convert|40|C}}, while winter in Minya sees temperatures drop to below {{convert|0|C}} levels at night. While [[hail]] or [[snow]] are extremely rare due to Minya's low precipitation averages, [[frost]] will occasionally form on cold winter nights. The average annual rainfall in Minya is {{convert|5.3|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite book|author= M. A.
