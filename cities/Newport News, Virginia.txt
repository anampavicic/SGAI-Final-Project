'''Newport News''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|n|uː|p|ɔːr|t|_|-|,_|-|p|ər|t|_|-}})<ref>{{cite LPD|3}}</ref> is an [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] in southeastern [[Virginia]], United States. At the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the population was 186,247.<ref name="QF2020">{{cite web| url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newportnewscityvirginia/PST045219|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|access-date=2021-12-20 |website=census.gov}}</ref> Located in the [[Hampton Roads]] region, it is the [[List of cities in Virginia|fifth-most populous city]] in Virginia and [[List of United States cities by population|140th-most populous city]] in the United States. The city is at the southeastern end of the [[Virginia Peninsula]], on the northern shore of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] to the river's mouth on the harbor of Hampton Roads.

Most of the area now known as Newport News was once a part of [[Warwick County, Virginia|Warwick County]], one of the eight original [[shires of Virginia]] formed in the British [[Colony of Virginia]] by order of [[Charles I of England]] in 1634. Newport News was a rural area of plantations and a small fishing village until after the [[American Civil War]]. In 1881, fifteen years of rapid development began under the leadership of [[Collis P. Huntington]], whose new [[Peninsula Extension]] of the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] opened up means of transportation for the railroad to bring [[West Virginia]] [[bituminous coal]] to port for coastal shipping. Within a few years, Huntington and his associates also built a large [[shipyard]]. Newport News was incorporated in 1896, the new [[incorporated town]]. In 1958, by mutual consent by referendum, Newport News was consolidated with [[Warwick, Virginia|Warwick]], rejoining the two localities to approximately their pre-1896 geographic size under the more widely-known name of Newport News.<ref name=":0" />

With many residents employed at the expansive [[Newport News Shipbuilding]], the joint [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]–[[United States Army|Army]] installation at [[Joint Base Langley–Eustis]], and other military bases and suppliers, the city's economy is very connected to the military. The location on the harbor and along the James River facilitates a large boating industry which can take advantage of its many miles of waterfront. Newport News also serves as a junction between the rails and the sea with the Newport News Marine Terminals located at the East End of the city. Served by major east–west [[Interstate 64 in Virginia|Interstate Highway 64]], it is linked to other cities of Hampton Roads by the circumferential [[Hampton Roads Beltway]], which crosses the harbor on two [[bridge-tunnel]]s. Part of the [[Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport]] is in the city limits.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Etymology==
The original area near the mouth of the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] was first referred to as ''Newportes Newes'' as early as 1621.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newport-news.org/media-center/newport-news-in-detail/newport-news-trivia-and-fun-facts.html |title=Newport News Trivia and Fun Facts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429194002/http://www.newport-news.org/media-center/newport-news-in-detail/newport-news-trivia-and-fun-facts.html |archive-date=April 29, 2008 |work=newport-news.org |access-date=June 21, 2009}}</ref>

The source of the name "Newport News" is not known with certainty, though it is the oldest English city name in the Americas.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eIXfJTdel0oC&q=%22newport+news%22|year=2010|title=Images of America: Downtown Newport News|first=William A.|last=Fox|access-date=November 3, 2018|location=Charleston, South Carolina|isbn=978-0-7385-8581-9|quote=Newport News is the oldest English place name of any city in the New World.|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|via=Google Books|page=7}}</ref> Several versions are recorded, and it is the subject of popular speculation locally. Probably the best-known explanation holds that when an early group of [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] colonists left to return to England after the [[Starving Time (Jamestown)|Starving Time]] during the winter of 1609–1610 aboard a ship of [[Christopher Newport|Captain Christopher Newport]], they encountered another fleet of supply ships under the new Governor [[Thomas West, 3rd Baron De La Warr]], in the James River off [[Mulberry Island]] with reinforcements of men and supplies. The new governor ordered them to turn around and return to Jamestown. Under this theory, the community was named for Newport's "good news". Another possibility is that the community may have derived its name from an old English word "news" meaning "new town". At least one source claims that the "New" arose from the original settlement's being rebuilt after a fire.<ref name="mariner_name">[http://www.mariner.org/library/research/flotsam.php#hp1 "Why Does Newport News Have Such an Odd Name?"], The Mariner's Museum website; accessed April 3, 2008.</ref>

Another source gave the original name as ''New Port Newce'', named for a person with the name Newce and the town's place as a new seaport. The namesake, Sir William Newce, was an English soldier and originally settled in Ireland. There he had established [[Newcestown]] near [[Bandon, County Cork]]. He sailed to Virginia with Sir [[Francis Wyatt]] in October 1621 and was granted {{convert|2500|acre|ha|0}} of land. He died two days later. His brother, Capt. Thomas Newce, was given "600 acres at [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kequatan]], now called [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]]." A partner [[Daniel Gookin]] completed founding the settlement.<ref>[http://ftp.rootsweb.com/pub/usgenweb/va/newportnews/history/misc0000.txt "History of Newport News"], ''William & Mary Quarterly'', 1901, scanned on Rootsweb.com; accessed April 3, 2008.</ref>

In his 1897 two-volume work ''Old Virginia and her Neighbors,'' American historian [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]] writes:<blockquote>... several old maps where the name is given as Newport Ness, being the mariner's way of saying Newport Point.<ref name="Fiske">Fiske ''Old Virginia and Her Neighbors'' – footnote (page 92)</ref></blockquote> The fact that the name formerly appeared as "Newport's News" is verified by numerous early documents and maps, and by local tradition. The change to Newport News came about through usage; by 1851 the Post Office Department sanctioned "New Port News" (written as three words) as the name of the first post office. In 1866 it approved the name as "Newport News", the current form.<ref name="mariner_name"/>

{{Main|History of Newport News, Virginia|Timeline of Newport News, Virginia|Warwick County, Virginia}}

===European settlement===
[[File:Warwick county va 1895.jpg|thumb|Warwick County (shaded in orange on this 1895 map) was originally one of the eight shires created in [[Colony of Virginia|colonial Virginia]] in 1634]]
During the 17th century, shortly after founding of [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1607, English settlers explored and began settling the areas adjacent to Hampton Roads. In 1610, Sir [[Thomas Gates (governor)|Thomas Gates]] seized a nearby [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] village, which became known as [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]]. At that time, settlers began clearing land along the James River (the eastern most section of which was called [[Hampton Roads]]) for plantations, including the present area of Newport News.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

In 1619, the area of Newport News was included in one of four huge corporations of the [[Virginia Company of London]]. It became known as [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] and extended west all the way to [[Skiffe's Creek]] (currently the border between Newport News and [[James City County, Virginia|James City County]]). Elizabeth Cittie included all of present-day [[South Hampton Roads]].<ref>''The Virginia Company of London, 1606–1624'', by Wesley Frank Craven, Charlottesville, VA: University Press of Virginia, 1957; {{ISBN|0-8063-4555-1}}</ref>

By 1634, the English colony of Virginia consisted of a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It was divided into eight [[shires of Virginia]], which were renamed as [[County (United States)|counties]] shortly thereafter. The area of Newport News became part of [[Warwick River Shire]], which became [[Warwick County, Virginia|Warwick County]] in 1637. By 1810, the [[county seat]] was at [[Denbigh, Virginia|Denbigh]]. For a short time in the mid-19th century, the county seat was moved to Newport News.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.discoverourtown.com/VA/local-54079.html |title=Old Warwick County Courthouse |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080620081444/http://www.discoverourtown.com/VA/local-54079.html |archive-date=June 20, 2008 |work=Discover Our Town |access-date=April 25, 2008}}</ref>

Newport News was a rural area of plantations and a small fishing village until after the [[American Civil War]]. Construction of the railroad and establishment of the great shipyard brought thousands of workers and associated development. It was one of only a few cities in Virginia to be newly established without earlier incorporation as a town. (Virginia has had an [[independent city (United States)|independent city]] political subdivision since 1871.) [[Walter A. Post]] served as the city's first mayor.<ref name="nntimeline">{{cite web|title=Newport News History Timeline |url=http://www.nngov.com/library/nnhistory |website=Newport News Public Library System |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714190229/http://www.nngov.com/library/nnhistory |archive-date=July 14, 2011 |access-date=April 3, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The area that formed the present-day southern end of Newport News had long been established as an unincorporated town. After [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction]] (the period after the American Civil War) the new City of Newport News was essentially founded by California merchant [[Collis P. Huntington]]. Huntington, one of the [[Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|Big Four]] associated with the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], in California, formed the western part of the country's [[First transcontinental railroad]]. He was recruited by former [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] General [[Williams Carter Wickham]] to become a major investor and guiding light for a southern railroad. He helped complete the [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] to the [[Ohio River]] in 1873.<ref>[http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaead/published/vt/viblbv00240.bioghist "Collis Huntington"], University of Virginia Library website; accessed July 24, 2015.</ref> On October 19, 1881, the first train to ever depart from Newport News left [[Lee Hall Depot]] on temporary tracks and arrived at [[Yorktown, Virginia|Yorktown]] for the 'Cornwallis Surrender Centennial Celebration", a commemoration of the British defeat at the [[Battle of yorktown|Battle of Yorktown]].<ref>Lash Jester, Annie (1961). Newport News Virginia, 1607-1960. City of Newport News.</ref>

Huntington knew the railroad could transport coal eastbound from West Virginia's untapped natural resources. His agents began acquiring land in Warwick County in 1865. In the 1880s, he oversaw extension of the C&O's new [[Peninsula Subdivision]], which extended from the [[Church Hill Tunnel]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] southeast down the peninsula through [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] to Newport News, where the company developed [[coal pier]]s on the harbor of Hampton Roads.<ref>[http://www.cohs.org Chesapeake and Ohio Historical Society]; accessed April 3, 2008.</ref>

His next project was to develop [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company]], which became the world's largest shipyard. Opened as Chesapeake Dry Dock & Construction Company, the shipbuilding was intended to build boats to transition goods from the rails to the seas. With President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s declaration to create a [[Great White Fleet]], the company entered the [[warship]] business by building seven of the first sixteen warships.

===1900s===
[[File:Washington Avenue in the 1940s.jpg|thumb|Washington Avenue, downtown, in the 1940s]]
In addition to Collis, other members of the Huntington family played major roles in Newport News. From 1912 to 1914, his nephew, [[Henry E. Huntington]], assumed leadership of the shipyard. [[Huntington Park (Newport News, Virginia)|Huntington Park]], developed after [[World War I]] near the northern terminus of the [[James River Bridge]], is named for him.<ref>[http://www.nn.northropgrumman.com/about/history.html "History"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051216183327/http://www.nn.northropgrumman.com/about/history.html |date=December 16, 2005 }}, Northrop Grumman Newport News Shipbuilding. Accessed April 3, 2008.</ref>

Collis Huntington's son, [[Archer M. Huntington]] and his wife, sculptor [[Anna Hyatt Huntington]], developed the [[Mariners' Museum]] beginning in 1932. They created a natural park and the community's [[The Mariners' Lake|Mariners' Lake]] in the process. A major feature of Newport News, the Mariners' Museum has grown to become one of the largest and finest [[maritime museum]]s in the world.<ref>[http://www.amnumsoc.org/archives/HuntingtonBio.htm Archer M.

The city grew in territory through the annexation of parts of Warwick County and also of the town of [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]] in adjoining [[Elizabeth City County, Virginia|Elizabeth City County]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bains |first=David R. |date=2022-08-17 |title=Town of Kecoughtan, Virginia |url=https://chasingchurches.com/2022/08/17/town-of-kecoughtan-virginia/ |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=Chasing Churches |language=en}}</ref>

In 1958, the citizenry of the cities of Warwick and Newport News voted by referendum to consolidate the two cities, choosing to assume the better-known name of Newport News. The merger created the third largest city by population in Virginia, with a {{convert|65|sqmi|km2|0}} area. The boundaries of the City of Newport News today are essentially the boundaries of the original Warwick River Shire and the traditional one of Warwick County, with the exception of minor border adjustments with neighbors.<ref name=":0">Scott, Thomas M. "Metropolitan Governmental Reorganization Proposals", ''The Western Political Quarterly'', Vol. 21, No. 2 (Jun. 1968), pp. 252–261 {{doi|10.2307/446305}}.</ref>

The city's original downtown area, on the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] waterfront, changed rapidly from a farm trading town to a new city in the last quarter of the 19th century. Development of the railroad terminal, with its coal piers, other harbor-related facilities, and the shipyard, brought new jobs and workers to the area. Although fashionable housing and businesses developed in downtown, the increase in industry and the development of new suburbs pushed and pulled retail and residential development to the west and north after [[World War II]]. Such suburban development was aided by national subsidization of highway construction and was part of a national trend to newer housing.

In July 1989, the United States Navy commissioned the third naval vessel named after the city with the entry of the Los Angeles-class nuclear submarine {{USS|Newport News|SSN-750|6}}, built at Newport News Shipbuilding, into active service.

The ship was initially commanded by CDR. Mark B. Keef; the city held a public celebration of the event, which was attended by Vice President of the United States Dan Quayle. In conjunction with this milestone, a song was written by a city native and formally adopted by Newport News City Council in July 1989. The lyrics appear with permission from the author:

<blockquote>(First verse): Harbor of a thousand ships/Forger of a nation's fleet/Gateway to the New World/Where ocean and river meet<br />(Chorus): Strength wrought from steel/And a people's fortitude/Such is the timeless legacy/Of a place called Newport News<br />(Second verse): Nestled in a blessed land/Gifted with a special view/Forever home for ev'ry man/With a spirit proud and true<br />(repeat chorus to fade)</blockquote>

===2000s===
Despite city efforts at large-scale revitalization, by the beginning of the 21st century, the downtown area consisted largely of the coal export facilities, the shipyard, and municipal offices. It is bordered by some harbor-related smaller businesses and lower income housing.<ref>[http://epa.gov/swerosps/bf/html-doc/snewnews.htm "Brownfields Supplemental Assistance"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030301115211/http://www.epa.gov/swerosps/bf/html-doc/snewnews.htm |date=March 1, 2003 }}, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency website, May 2002.</ref>

Newport News grew in population from the 1960s through the 1990s. The city began to explore [[New Urbanism]] as a way to develop areas midtown. City Center at Oyster Point was developed out of a small portion of the Oyster Point Business Park. It opened in phases from 2003 through 2005. The city invested $82 million of public funding in the project.<ref>[http://www.citycenteratoysterpoint.com/newsletter/pdf/daily_press_editorial.pdf Editorial: "Changing Place"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513192359/http://www.citycenteratoysterpoint.com/newsletter/pdf/daily_press_editorial.pdf |date=May 13, 2008 }}, ''Daily Press'' (Newport News, VA).

The city's downtown area was part of the earliest developed area which was initially incorporated as an independent city in 1896. The earlier city portions also included the "[[East End (Newport News, Virginia)|East End]]" or "Southeast" community, which was predominantly black American, the "North End" and the shipyard and coal piers. The town of [[Kecoughtan, Virginia|Kecoughtan]] in [[Elizabeth City County, Virginia|Elizabeth City County]] was annexed by Newport News in 1927, extending the city along Hampton Roads from Salter's Creek to Pear Avenue. After World War II, public housing projects and lower income housing were built to improve housing in what came to be known as the [[East End (Newport News, Virginia)|East End]] or "The Bottom" by locals.<ref name="nntimeline" /> The city expanded primarily westward where land was available and highways were built. While the shipyard and coal facilities, and other smaller harbor-oriented businesses have remained vibrant, the downtown area went into substantial decline. Crime problems have plagued the nearby lower-income residential areas.

West of the traditional downtown area, another early portion of the city was developed as Huntington Heights. In modern times been called the [[North End Historic District (Newport News, Virginia)|North End]]. Developed primarily between 1900 and 1935, North End features a wealth of architectural styles and eclectic vernacular building designs. Extending along west to the [[James River Bridge]] approaches, it includes scenic views of the river. A well-preserved community, the North End is an historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] and the [[Virginia Landmarks Register]].<ref>[http://historichamptonroads.com/huntington_heights.htm Huntington Heights on the Hampton Roads history and penny postcard tour]; accessed April 3, 2008.</ref>

The 1958 merger by mutual agreement with the City of Warwick removed the political boundary, which was adjacent to [[Mercury Boulevard]]. This major north–south roadway carries [[U.S. Route 258 in Virginia|U.S. Route 258]] between the [[James River Bridge]] and the Coliseum-Central area of adjacent Hampton. At the time, the county was mostly rural, although along Warwick Boulevard north of the Mercury Boulevard, [[Hilton Village]] was developed during [[World War I]] as a [[planned community]]. Beyond this point to the west, much of the city takes on a suburban nature. Many neighborhoods have been developed, some around a number of former small towns. Miles of waterfront along the James River, and tributaries such as Deep Creek and Lucas Creek, are occupied by higher-end single family homes. In many sections, wooded land and farms gave way to subdivisions. Even at the northwestern reaches, furthest from the traditional downtown area, some residential development has occurred. Much land has been set aside for natural protection, with recreational and historical considerations. Along with some newer residential areas, major features of the northwestern end include the reservoirs of the Newport News Water System (which include much of the [[Warwick River (Virginia)|Warwick River]]), the expansive [[Newport News Park]], a number of public schools, and the military installations of [[Fort Eustis]] and a small portion of the [[Naval Weapons Station Yorktown]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

At the extreme northwestern edge adjacent to [[Skiffe's Creek]] and the border with James City County is the [[Lee Hall, Virginia|Lee Hall]] community, which retains historical features including the former [[Chesapeake and Ohio Railway]] station which served tens of thousands of soldiers based at what became nearby Fort Eustis during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The larger-than-normal rural two-story frame depot is highly valued by rail fans and rail preservationists.<ref>[http://www.leehalldepot.org Lee Hall Depot webpage], leehalldepot.org; accessed April 3, 2008.</ref>

In downtown Newport News, the [[Newport News Victory Arch|Victory Arch]], built to commemorate the [[World War I|Great War]], sits on the downtown waterfront. The "Eternal Flame" under the arch was cast by Womack Foundry, Inc. in the 1960s. It was hand crafted by the Foundry's founder and president, Ernest D. Womack. The downtown area has a number of landmarks and architecturally interesting buildings, which for some time were mostly abandoned in favor of building new areas in the northwest areas of the city (a strategy aided by tax incentives in the postwar years).

City leaders are working to bring new life into this area, by renovating and building new homes and attracting businesses. The completion of [[Interstate 664]] restored the area to access and through traffic which had been largely rerouted with the completion of the [[Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel]] connecting neighboring [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]] with the [[South Hampton Roads|Southside]] in 1958 and discontinuance of the Newport News-Norfolk ferry service at that time. The larger capacity [[Monitor-Merrimac Memorial Bridge-Tunnel]] and the rebuilt [[James River Bridge]] each restored some accessibility and through traffic to the downtown area.<ref>[http://www.roadstothefuture.com/I664_VA_Desc.html I-664] Roads to the Future; accessed April 3, 2008</ref><ref name="traffic counts Isle of Wight">{{cite web|url= http://www.virginiadot.org/info/resources/AADT_046_IsleofWight_2005.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.virginiadot.org/info/resources/AADT_046_IsleofWight_2005.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |title=2005 Virginia Department of Transportation Jurisdiction Report – Daily Traffic Volume Estimates – Isle of Wight County }}&nbsp;{{small|(219&nbsp;KB)}} Accessed April 3, 2008.</ref>

Much of the newer commercial development has been along the Warwick Boulevard and Jefferson Avenue corridors, with newer planned industrial, commercial, and mixed development such as Oyster Point, Kiln Creek and the City Center. While the downtown area had long been the area of the city that offered the traditional urban layout, the city has supported a number of [[New Urbanism]] projects. One is [[Port Warwick]], named after the fictional city in [[William Styron]]'s novel, ''[[Lie Down in Darkness (novel)|Lie Down in Darkness]]''. Port Warwick includes housing for a broad variety of citizens, from retired persons to off-campus housing for [[Christopher Newport University]] students. Also included are several high-end restaurants and upscale shopping.<ref>[http://www.portwarwick.com Port Warwick webpage], portwarwick.com; accessed April 3, 2008.</ref>

[[City Center at Oyster Point]], located near Port Warwick, has been touted as the new "downtown"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} because of its new geographic centrality on the Virginia Peninsula, its proximity to the retail/business nucleus of the city, etc. Locally, it is often called simply "City Center".<ref>[http://www.citycenteratoysterpoint.com City Center at Oyster Point], citycenteratoysterpoint.com; accessed April 3, 2008.</ref> Nearby, the Virginia Living Museum recently completed a $22.6 million expansion plan.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Erickson|first1=Mark St. John|title=Virginia Living Museum timeline|url=http://www.dailypress.com/features/family/dp-ticket-vlmtimeline-htmlstory.html|website=dailypress.com|publisher=Daily Press|access-date=December 26, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161226215114/http://www.dailypress.com/features/family/dp-ticket-vlmtimeline-htmlstory.html|archive-date=December 26, 2016|url-status=live|date=May 5, 2016}}</ref>

Newport News is also home to a small Korean [[ethnic enclave]] on Warwick Boulevard near the Denbigh neighborhood on the northern end of the city. Although it lacks the density and character of larger, more established enclaves, it has been referred to as "Little Seoul"—being the commercial center for the Hampton Roads Korean community.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vegh|first=Steven G.|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2009/11/little-seoul-warwick-boulevard|title=A little 'Seoul' on Warwick Boulevard|publisher=HamptonRoads.com|date=November 14, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725075547/http://hamptonroads.com/2009/11/little-seoul-warwick-boulevard|archive-date=July 25, 2015|url-status=live|access-date=August 30, 2013}}</ref>

Some of these neighborhoods are located in the former City of Warwick and Warwick County.

===Climate===
Newport News is located in the [[humid subtropical climate]] zone, with cool to mild winters, and hot, humid summers. Due to the inland location, throughout the year, highs are {{convert|2|to|3|F-change|C-change|1}} warmer and lows {{convert|1|to|2|F-change|C-change|1}} cooler than areas to the southeast. Snowfall averages {{convert|5.8|in|cm}} per season, and the summer months tend to be slightly wetter. The geographic location of the city, with respect to the principal storm tracks, favours fair weather, as it is south of the average path of storms originating in the higher latitudes, and north of the usual tracks of hurricanes and other major tropical storms.<ref name="Virginia Hurricane Climatology">Information from [http://www.wpc.ncep.noaa.gov/research/roth/vaclimohur.htm NOAA], wpc.ncep.noaa.gov; accessed July 24, 2015.</ref>

== Religion ==
As a [[New South]] industrial city, Newport News developed a religious diversity greater than neighboring cities. The oldest congregation in the city, First Church of Newport News (Baptist) was organized in 1863, well in advance of the foundation of the city. Railroad connections encouraged [[Mennonites]] to establish farms and a colony in [[Warwick County, Virginia|Warwick County]] and a congregation in the city itself. The city was fertile ground for black American evangelists including [[Lightfoot Solomon Michaux]] and [[Marcelino Manuel da Graça|Daddy Grace]]. Several synagogues were established in the city, and at least two of its historic church buildings, [[First Baptist Church (Newport News, Virginia)|First Baptist Church]] and [[St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church (Newport News, Virginia)|St. Vincent de Paul Catholic Church]] were added to the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bains |first=David R. |date=2022-08-19 |title=Churches in Newport News: An Alphabet |url=https://chasingchurches.com/2022/08/19/churches-in-newport-news-an-alphabet/ |access-date=2022-08-19 |website=Chasing Churches |language=en}}</ref>
