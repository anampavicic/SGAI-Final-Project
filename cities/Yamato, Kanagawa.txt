==History==
The area around present-day Yamato city has been inhabited for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found [[stone tool]]s from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period and ceramic shards from the [[Jōmon period]] at numerous locations in the area. It is mentioned in the ''[[Engishiki]]'' records from the [[Heian period]]. By the [[Kamakura period]], this area became part of the Shibuya ''[[shōen]]''. It came under control of the [[Ashikaga clan]] in the early [[Muromachi period]] and was later part of the territories of the [[Later Hōjō clan]] from [[Odawara, Kanagawa|Odawara]]. With the start of the [[Edo period]], the area was part of the ''[[tenryō]]'' territory in [[Sagami Province]] controlled directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], but administered through various ''[[hatamoto]]''. Under the rule of the 5th ''[[shōgun]]'', [[Tokugawa Tsunayoshi]], one of these ''hatamoto'', Sakamoto Shigeharu (1630–1693) by virtue of his position as ''[[Ōmetsuke]]'' and ''[[Jisha-bugyō]]'', exceeded 10,000 ''[[koku]]'' in income, and thus became ''[[daimyō]]'' of the newly proclaimed Fukami Domain in October 1682. However, his revenues decreased below 10,000 ''koku'' in May 1687 and the [[han (administrative division)|domain]] was suppressed.

During the cadastral reforms after the [[Meiji Restoration]], the area of present-day Yamato became part of [[Kōza District, Kanagawa|Kōza District]], Kanagawa Prefecture. On April 1, 1889, it was administratively divided into Shibuya Village and Tsurumi Village, which later changed its name on September 25, 1891 to Yamato Village. The area was connected by rail in 1926 via the [[Sagami Railway]] and in 1929 by the [[Odakyu Electric Railway]], leading to an increase in population. The [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] Sagamino Air Base was established in 1940. Yamato Village became Yamato Town in 1943, and Shibuya Village became Shibuya Town in 1944. However, Shibuya was dissolved in 1955, with a portion merging with nearby [[Fujisawa, Kanagawa|Fujisawa]], and the remaining portion reverting to village status. That portion was merged with Yamato in 1957, which became Yamato City in 1959. In April 2000, Yamato exceeded 200,000 in population, and was proclaimed a [[Special cities of Japan|special city]] with increased local autonomy.

In 2020, the city gained international attention for outlawing walking in designated areas while using a smartphone, it was the first of its kind to do so without implementing a fine or monetary penalty.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Dayman|first=Lucy|date=19 August 2020|title=The Japanese city that banned 'smartphone-walking'|work=BBC|url=https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20200810-yamato-japan-smartphone-ban-while-walking}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mainichi.jp/english/articles/20200625/p2g/00m/0na/111000c|title=Yamato becomes Japan's 1st city to 'ban' use of phones while walking|newspaper=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=2020-06-25|access-date=2020-06-25}}</ref>

In terms of national politics, the city is part of Kanagawa 13th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Education==

The city has four public high schools operated by the Kanagawa Prefectural Board of Education, and the prefecture also operates two special education schools for the handicapped.
