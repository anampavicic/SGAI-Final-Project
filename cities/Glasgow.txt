Glasgow grew from a small rural settlement close to [[Glasgow Cathedral]] and descending to the [[River Clyde]] to become the largest seaport in Scotland, and tenth largest by tonnage in Britain. Expanding from the [[medieval]] [[Archbishop of Glasgow|bishopric]] and episcopal [[burgh]] (subsequently [[royal burgh]]), and the later establishment of the [[University of Glasgow]] in the 15th century, it became a major centre of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] in the 18th century. From the 18th century onwards, the city also grew as one of Britain's main hubs of oceanic trade with [[British America|North America]] and the [[British West Indies|West Indies]]; soon followed by the [[Orient]], [[India]], and [[China]]. With the onset of the [[Industrial Revolution]], the population and economy of Glasgow and the surrounding region expanded rapidly to become one of the world's pre-eminent centres of chemicals, textiles and engineering; most notably in the [[shipbuilding]] and [[Naval architecture|marine engineering]] industry, which produced many innovative and famous vessels. Glasgow was the "Second City of the [[British Empire]]" for much of the [[Victorian era|Victorian]] and [[Edwardian era]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/victorian/trails_victorian_glasgow.shtml |title=Victorian Glasgow |access-date=14 September 2010 |publisher=BBC History |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514172952/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/scottishhistory/victorian/trails_victorian_glasgow.shtml |archive-date=14 May 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/History/The+Second+City.htm |title=About Glasgow: The Second City of the Empire&nbsp;– the 19th century |access-date=9 July 2007 |publisher=Glasgow City Council |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070402171109/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/AboutGlasgow/History/The%2BSecond%2BCity.htm |archive-date=2 April 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=W H |url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/storyd.php |title=Second City of The Empire: 1830s to 1914 |access-date=7 January 2008 |publisher=University of Glasgow |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080105124204/http://www.theglasgowstory.com/storyd.php |archive-date=5 January 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=McIlvanney |first=W |url=http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/vibrant6-glasgow.html |title=Glasgow&nbsp;– city of reality |access-date=7 January 2008 |publisher=Scotland&nbsp;– the official online gateway |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071204064459/http://www.scotland.org/about/innovation-and-creativity/features/culture/vibrant6-glasgow.html |archive-date=4 December 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Glasgow became a [[county of city|county]] in 1893, the city having previously been in the [[Shires of Scotland|historic county]] of [[Lanarkshire]], and later growing to also include settlements that were once part of [[Renfrewshire]] and [[Dunbartonshire]]. It now forms the Glasgow City Council area, one of the 32 [[council areas of Scotland]], and is administered by [[Glasgow City Council]]. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Glasgow's population grew rapidly, reaching a peak of 1,127,825 people in 1938 (with a higher density and within a smaller territory than in subsequent decades).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/E3BE21DA-4D84-4CC4-9C02-2E526FDD9169/0/4population.pdf |title=Factsheet 4: Population |publisher=Glasgow City Council |access-date=9 July 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070703130648/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/E3BE21DA-4D84-4CC4-9C02-2E526FDD9169/0/4population.pdf |archive-date=3 July 2007}}</ref> The population was greatly reduced following comprehensive [[urban renewal]] projects in the 1960s which resulted in large-scale relocation of people to designated [[new town]]s, such as [[Cumbernauld]], [[Livingston, West Lothian|Livingston]], [[East Kilbride]] and peripheral suburbs, followed by successive boundary changes.

==Etymology and heraldry==
{{main|Coat of arms of Glasgow City Council}}

The name Glasgow is [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]] in origin. The first element ''glas'', meaning "grey-green, grey-blue" both in [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic]], [[Scottish Gaelic]] and modern day [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and the second ''*cöü'', "hollow" (cf. [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''glas-cau''),<ref name="bliton">{{cite web |last1=James |first1=Alan |title=A Guide to the Place-Name Evidence |url=https://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary_2019_Edition.pdf |website=SPNS – The Brittonic Language in the Old North |access-date=13 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190307061257/https://spns.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Alan_James_Brittonic_Language_in_the_Old_North_BLITON_Volume_II_Dictionary_2019_Edition.pdf |archive-date=7 March 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> giving a meaning of "green-hollow".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://glaschu.net/placenames-project-university-of-glasgow/ |title=Glaschu |website=Glaschu |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801031412/https://glaschu.net/placenames-project-university-of-glasgow/ |archive-date=1 August 2020 |access-date=30 April 2020}}</ref> It is often said that the name means "dear green place" or that "dear green place" is a translation from Gaelic ''Glas Caomh''.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018 |title=Our Dear Green Place |url=https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=42440&p=0 |website=glasgow.gov.uk |publisher=Glasgow City Council |access-date=7 October 2020 |archive-date=24 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201124010832/https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=42440&p=0 |url-status=live}}</ref> "The dear green place" remains an affectionate way of referring to the city. The modern Gaelic is ''Glaschu'' and derived from the same roots as the Brittonic.

The settlement may have an earlier Brittonic name, '''Cathures'''; the modern name appears for the first time in the Gaelic period (1116), as ''Glasgu''. It is also recorded that the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde|King of Strathclyde]], [[Rhydderch Hael]], welcomed Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), and procured his consecration as bishop about 540. For some thirteen years Kentigern laboured in the region, building his church at the [[Molendinar Burn]] where [[Glasgow Cathedral]] now stands, and making many converts. A large community developed around him and became known as ''Glasgu''.

The [[coat of arms]] of the City of Glasgow was granted to the [[royal burgh]] by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms|Lord Lyon]] on 25 October 1866.<ref>Urquhart, R.M. (1973) ''Scottish Burgh and County Heraldry''. London. Heraldry Today. {{ISBN|978-0900455247}}.</ref> It incorporates a number of symbols and emblems associated with the life of Glasgow's patron saint, Mungo, which had been used on official seals prior to that date. The emblems represent [[Saint Mungo#Miracles|miracles]] supposed to have been performed by Mungo<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=17325 |title=The City Crest |website=Glasgow City Council |access-date=23 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180923235309/https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=17325 |archive-date=23 September 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and are listed in the traditional rhyme:
::::''Here's the bird that never flew''
::::''Here's the tree that never grew''
::::''Here's the bell that never rang''
::::''Here's the fish that never swam''

St Mungo is also said to have preached a sermon containing the words ''Lord, Let Glasgow flourish by the preaching of the word and the praising of thy name''. This was abbreviated to "Let Glasgow Flourish" and adopted as the city's motto.

In 1450, John Stewart, the first [[Lord Provost]] of Glasgow, left an endowment so that a "St Mungo's Bell" could be made and tolled throughout the city so that the citizens would pray for his soul. A new bell was purchased by the magistrates in 1641 and that bell is still on display in the [[People's Palace, Glasgow|People's Palace]] Museum, near [[Glasgow Green]].

The supporters are two salmon bearing rings, and the crest is a half length figure of Saint Mungo. He wears a bishop's mitre and liturgical vestments and has his hand raised in "the act of [[benediction]]". The original 1866 grant placed the crest atop a helm, but this was removed in subsequent grants. The current version (1996) has a gold [[mural crown]] between the shield and the crest. This form of coronet, resembling an embattled city wall, was allowed to the four area councils with city status.

The arms were re-matriculated by the City of [[Glasgow District Council]] on 6 February 1975, and by the present area council on 25 March 1996.

===Early history===
[[File:Map of Glasgow in 1776.jpg|thumb|right|An early map of Glasgow in 1776, centred on Glasgow Cross.]]

The area around Glasgow has hosted communities for millennia,{{specify|reason="millennia" is the plural of millennium. Two millennia, ten millennial, 17 millennia?|date=July 2024}} with the [[River Clyde]] providing a natural location for fishing. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] later built outposts in the area and, to protect Roman [[Britannia]] from the [[Brittonic languages|Brittonic speaking]] ([[Insular Celts|Celtic]]) [[Caledonians]], constructed the [[Antonine Wall]]. Items from the wall, such as altars from [[Castra|Roman forts]] like [[Balmuildy]], can be found at the [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery|Hunterian Museum]] today.

Glasgow itself was reputed to have been founded by the Christian [[missionary]] [[Saint Mungo]] in the 6th century. He established a church on the [[Molendinar Burn]], where the present [[Glasgow Cathedral]] stands, and in the following years Glasgow became a religious centre.
Glasgow grew over the following centuries as part of the [[Kingdom of Strathclyde]] and the [[Kingdom of Scotland]]. The [[Glasgow Fair]] reportedly began in 1190.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lindsay |first1=Sir John |title=The City of Glasgow : its origin, growth and development; with maps and plates |date=1921 |publisher=Royal Scottish Geographical Society |location=Edinburgh |page=26 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cityofglasgowits00newb#page/26/mode/2up/search/1190 |access-date=3 December 2017}}</ref> A bridge over the River Clyde was recorded from around 1285, where [[Victoria Bridge, Glasgow|Victoria Bridge]] now stands. As the [[lowest bridging point]] on the Clyde it was an important crossing. The area around the bridge became known as Briggait. The founding of the [[University of Glasgow]] adjoining the cathedral in 1451 and elevation of the [[Diocese|bishopric]] to become the [[Archdiocese of Glasgow]] in 1492 increased the town's religious and educational status and landed wealth. Its early trade was in agriculture, brewing and fishing, with cured salmon and herring being exported to Europe and the Mediterranean.<ref name="ReferenceA">The City of Glasgow – The Third Statistical Account of Scotland, published 1958</ref> By the fifteenth century the urban area stretched from the area around the cathedral and university in the north down to the bridge and the banks of the Clyde in the south along [[High Street, Glasgow|High Street]], [[Saltmarket]] and Bridgegate, crossing an east–west route at [[Glasgow Cross]] which became the commercial centre of the city.<ref>{{cite book |title=Glasgow Central Conservation Area Appraisal |date=2012 |publisher=Glasgow City Council |location=Glasgow |page=6 |url=https://glasgow.gov.uk/CHttpHandler.ashx?id=10838&p=0 |access-date=26 January 2023}}</ref>

===Scottish Reformation===

Following the European Protestant [[Scottish Reformation|Reformation]] and with the encouragement of the [[Convention of Royal Burghs]], the 14 incorporated trade crafts federated as the Trades House in 1605 to match the power and influence in the town council of the earlier Merchants' Guilds who established their Merchants House in the same year.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> Glasgow was subsequently raised to the status of [[Royal Burgh]] in 1611.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10359752|title=Glasgow Burgh|publisher=Vision of Britain|access-date=15 July 2022}}</ref> [[Daniel Defoe]] visited the city in the early 18th century and famously opined in his book ''[[A tour thro' the whole island of Great Britain]]'', that Glasgow was "the cleanest and beautifullest, and best built city in Britain, London excepted". At that time the city's population was about 12,000, and the city was yet to undergo the massive expansionary changes to its economy and urban fabric, brought about by the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] and Industrial Revolution.

The city prospered from its involvement in the [[triangular trade]] and the [[Atlantic slave trade]] that the former depended upon. Glasgow merchants dealt in slave-produced [[cash crop]]s such as sugar, tobacco, cotton and linen.<ref name="Lambert 2021">{{cite web |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A History of Glasgow |website=Local Histories |date=14 March 2021 |url=https://localhistories.org/a-history-of-glasgow/ |access-date=2 November 2021 |archive-date=2 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211102201701/https://localhistories.org/a-history-of-glasgow/ |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Slavery, Glasgow Plantation Owners in Jamaica">{{cite web |title=Glasgow Plantation Owners in Jamaica – Legacies of Slavery in Glasgow Museums and Collections |website=Legacies of Slavery in Glasgow Museums and Collections |date=29 August 2018 |url=https://glasgowmuseumsslavery.co.uk/2018/08/29/glasgow-plantation-owners-in-jamaica/ |access-date=2 November 2021 |archive-date=2 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211102202107/https://glasgowmuseumsslavery.co.uk/2018/08/29/glasgow-plantation-owners-in-jamaica/ |url-status=live}}</ref> From 1717 to 1766, Scottish [[slave ship]]s operating out of Glasgow transported approximately 3,000 enslaved Africans to the Americas (out of a total number of 5,000 slaves carried by ships from Scotland).

===Economic growth===

After the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] in 1707, Scotland gained further access to the vast markets of the new British Empire, and Glasgow became prominent as a hub of international trade to and from the Americas, especially in sugar, tobacco, cotton, and manufactured goods. Starting in 1668, the city's [[Tobacco Lords]] created a deep water port at [[Port Glasgow]] about {{cvt|20|mi|km}} down the [[River Clyde]], as the river from the city to that point was then too shallow for seagoing merchant ships.<ref>[http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ Abolition of the Slave Trade] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103172434/http://www.ltscotland.org.uk/abolition/ |date=3 January 2012}}.

The opening of the [[Monkland Canal]] and basin linking to the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] at [[Port Dundas]] in 1795, facilitated access to the extensive iron-ore and coal mines in [[Lanarkshire]]. After extensive [[river engineering]] projects to dredge and deepen the River Clyde as far as Glasgow, shipbuilding became a major industry on the upper stretches of the river, pioneered by industrialists such as [[Robert Napier (engineer)|Robert Napier]], [[John Elder (shipbuilder)|John Elder]], [[George Thomson (shipbuilder)|George Thomson]], [[Sir William Pearce, 1st Baronet|Sir William Pearce]] and [[Alfred Yarrow|Sir Alfred Yarrow]]. The River Clyde also became an important source of inspiration for artists, such as [[John Atkinson Grimshaw]], [[John Knox (artist)|John Knox]], [[James Kay (artist)|James Kay]], [[Sir Muirhead Bone]], [[Robert Eadie]] and [[L.S. Lowry]], willing to depict the new industrial era and the modern world, as did [[Stanley Spencer]] downriver at [[Port Glasgow]].

===Population growth===
[[File:Gezicht in Glasgow The Clyde from Sailors Home (titel op object), RP-F-F01864.jpg|thumb|left|Glasgow in 1864 during the height of its population surge]]

With the population growing, the first scheme to provide a public water supply was by the Glasgow Company in 1806. A second company was formed in 1812, and the two merged in 1838, but there was some dissatisfaction with the quality of the water supplied.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=190}} The Gorbals Gravitation Water Company began supplying water to residents living to the south of the River Clyde in 1846, obtained from reservoirs, which gave 75,000 people a constant water supply,{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |p=190}} but others were not so fortunate, and some 4,000 died in an outbreak of [[cholera]] in 1848/1849.<ref name=timeline>{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1244 |title=Loch Katrine and aqueducts |publisher=Engineering Timelines |access-date=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825110358/http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1244 |archive-date=25 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> This led to the development of the [[Glasgow Corporation Water Works]], with a project to raise the level of [[Loch Katrine]] and to convey clean water by gravity along a {{cvt|26|mi|km|adj=on}} aqueduct to a holding reservoir at Milngavie, and then by pipes into the city.{{sfn |Binnie |1981 |pp=191–192}} The project cost £980,000<ref name=timeline/> and was opened by [[Queen Victoria]] in 1859.{{sfn |Cross-Rudkin |Chrimes |2008 |p=62}}

The engineer for the project was [[John Frederick Bateman]], while James Morris Gale became the resident engineer for the city section of the project, and subsequently became Engineer in Chief for Glasgow Water Commissioners. He oversaw several improvements during his tenure, including a second aqueduct and further raising of water levels in Loch Katrine.{{sfn |Cross-Rudkin |Chrimes |2008 |p=325}} Additional supplies were provided by Loch Arklet in 1902, by impounding the water and creating a tunnel to allow water to flow into Loch Katrine. A similar scheme to create a reservoir in [[Glen Finglas]] was authorised in 1903, but was deferred, and was not completed until 1965.<ref name=timeline/> Following the [[2002 Glasgow floods]], the waterborne parasite [[cryptosporidium]] was found in the reservoir at Milngavie, and so the new [[Milngavie water treatment works]] was built. It was opened by [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth]] in 2007, and won the 2007 Utility Industry Achievement Award, having been completed ahead of its time schedule and for £10 million below its budgeted cost.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.waterbriefing.org/home/company-news/item/614-queen-opens-milngavie-water-treatment-works-in-scotland |title=Queen opens Milngavie water treatment works in Scotland |publisher=Water Briefing |date=8 August 2008}}</ref>

Good health requires both clean water and effective removal of sewage. The [[Caledonian Railway]] rebuilt many of the sewers, as part of a deal to allow them to tunnel under the city, and sewage treatment works were opened at Dalmarnoch in 1894, Dalmuir in 1904 and Shieldhall in 1910. The works experimented to find better ways to treat sewage, and a number of experimental filters were constructed, until a full activated sludge plant was built between 1962 and 1968 at a cost of £4 million.<ref name=timeline2>{{cite web |url=http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1250 |title=Dalmarnock Sewage Treatment Works |publisher=Engineering Timelines |access-date=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180826005118/http://www.engineering-timelines.com/scripts/engineeringItem.asp?id=1250 |archive-date=26 August 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> Treated sludge was dumped at sea, and Glasgow Corporation owned six sludge ships between 1904 and 1998,<ref name=shieldhall>{{cite web |url=https://www.ss-shieldhall.co.uk/Glasgow_fleet |title=History of the Glasgow Sludge Fleet |access-date=27 August 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180825212533/https://www.ss-shieldhall.co.uk/Glasgow_fleet |archive-date=25 August 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> when the EU [[Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive]] ended the practice.{{sfn |Lobina |Terhorst |2005 |p=30}} The sewerage infrastructure was improved significantly in 2017, with the completion of a tunnel {{cvt|3.1|mi|km}} long, which provides {{cvt|20|e6impgal|Ml|sigfig=1}} of storm water storage.

Glasgow's population had surpassed that of Edinburgh by 1821. The development of civic institutions included the [[City of Glasgow Police]] in 1800, one of the first municipal [[police]] forces in the world. Despite the crisis caused by the [[City of Glasgow Bank]]'s collapse in 1878, growth continued and by the end of the 19th century it was one of the cities known as the "Second City of the Empire" and was producing more than half Britain's tonnage of shipping<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theglasgowstory.com/storyd.php |title=Second City of The Empire: 1830s to 1914 |publisher=The Glasgow Story |year=2004 |access-date=9 July 2008 |first=W.

Shipping, banking, insurance and professional services expanded at the same time.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

Glasgow became one of the first cities in Europe to reach a population of one million. The city's new trades and sciences attracted new residents from across the [[Lowlands of Scotland|Lowlands]] and the [[Highlands of Scotland]], from [[Ireland]] and other parts of Britain and from [[Continental Europe]].<ref name="ReferenceA"/> During this period, the construction of many of the city's greatest architectural masterpieces and most ambitious civil engineering projects, such as the [[Milngavie water treatment works]], [[Glasgow Subway]], [[Glasgow Corporation Tramways]], [[Glasgow City Chambers|City Chambers]], [[Mitchell Library]] and [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] were being funded by its wealth. The city also held a series of [[List of world's fairs|International Exhibitions]] at [[Kelvingrove Park]], in [[International Exhibition of Science, Art and Industry|1888]], [[Glasgow International Exhibition (1901)|1901]] and [[Scottish Exhibition of National History, Art and Industry|1911]], with Britain's last major International Exhibition, the [[Empire Exhibition, Scotland 1938|Empire Exhibition]], being subsequently held in 1938 at [[Bellahouston Park]], which drew 13 million visitors.<ref>Glasgow's Great Exhibitions by Perilla Kinchin and others, published 1988</ref>

===20th century===
[[File:A Middle East Soldier Revisits Britain- Life in Wartime Glasgow, Scotland, UK, 1943 D15608.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Sauchiehall Street]] during [[World War II]] (1943)]]

The 20th century witnessed both decline and renewal in the city. After [[World War I]], the city suffered from the impact of the [[Post–World War I recession]] and from the later [[Great Depression in the United Kingdom|Great Depression]], this also led to a rise of radical socialism and the "[[Red Clydeside]]" movement. The city had recovered by the outbreak of [[World War II]]. The city saw [[Strategic bombing|aerial bombardment]] by the [[Luftwaffe]]<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/29/a4095029.shtml |title=Blitz in Glasgow |publisher=BBC |access-date=6 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815210112/http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/stories/29/a4095029.shtml |archive-date=15 August 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref> during the [[Clydebank Blitz]], during the war, then grew through the post-war boom that lasted through the 1950s. By the 1960s, growth of industry in countries like Japan and [[West Germany]], weakened the once pre-eminent position of many of the city's industries. As a result of this, Glasgow entered a lengthy period of relative economic decline and rapid de-industrialisation, leading to high unemployment, [[urban decay]], population decline, [[welfare dependency]] and poor health for the city's inhabitants. There were active attempts at regeneration of the city, when the Glasgow Corporation published its controversial ''[[Bruce Report]]'', which set out a comprehensive series of initiatives aimed at turning round the decline of the city. The report led to a huge and radical programme of rebuilding and regeneration efforts that started in the mid-1950s and lasted into the late 1970s. This involved the mass demolition of the city's infamous slums and their replacement with large suburban housing estates and tower blocks.<ref name="Staples">{{cite web |url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=986122002 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050119043309/http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=986122002 |archive-date=19 January 2005 |title=Secret plot to strip Glasgow of influence |website=The Scotsman |location=UK |date=5 September 2002 |access-date=11 December 2007 |first=John |last=Staples}}</ref>

The city invested heavily in roads infrastructure, with an extensive system of arterial roads and motorways that bisected the central area. There are also accusations that the [[Scottish Office]] had deliberately attempted to undermine Glasgow's economic and political influence in post-war Scotland by diverting inward investment in new industries to other regions during the [[Silicon Glen]] boom and creating the [[New towns#United Kingdom|new towns]] of Cumbernauld, Glenrothes, Irvine, Livingston and [[East Kilbride]], dispersed across the [[Scottish Lowlands]] to halve the city's population base.<ref name="Staples"/> By the late 1980s, there had been a significant resurgence in Glasgow's economic fortunes. The "[[Glasgow's miles better]]" campaign, launched in 1983, and opening of the [[Burrell Collection]] in 1983 and [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]] in 1985 facilitated Glasgow's new role as a European centre for business services and finance and promoted an increase in tourism and inward investment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/7468870.stm |title=Why Glasgow was 'miles better' |work=BBC News |date=23 June 2008 |access-date=30 July 2008 |first=Reevel |last=Alderson |archive-date=22 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122084724/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/scotland/7468870.stm |url-status=live}}</ref> The latter continues to be bolstered by the legacy of the city's [[Glasgow Garden Festival]] in 1988, its status as [[European Capital of Culture]] in 1990,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uneecc.org/european-capitals-of-culture/history/ |title=European Capital of Culture |publisher=UNEECC.org |access-date=3 August 2021 |archive-date=17 July 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210717134431/https://uneecc.org/european-capitals-of-culture/history/ |url-status=live}}</ref> and concerted attempts to diversify the city's economy.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://openscotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/27153210/10 |title=Interim Evaluation of the Cities Growth Fund: A Report to the Scottish Executive&nbsp;– Appendix 4: Glasgow |publisher=[[Scottish Government]] |date=March 2007 |access-date=26 June 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302023804/http://openscotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/27153210/10 |archive-date=2 March 2012}}</ref> However, it is the industrial heritage that serves as key tourism enabler.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Butler |first1=Richard |last2=Curran |first2=Ross |last3=O'Gorman |first3=Kevin D. |date=1 September 2013 |title=Pro-Poor Tourism in a First World Urban Setting: Case Study of Glasgow Govan |journal=International Journal of Tourism Research |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=443–457 |doi=10.1002/jtr.1888 |issn=1522-1970}}</ref> Wider economic revival has persisted and the ongoing [[Urban renewal|regeneration]] of inner-city areas, including the large-scale [[Clyde Waterfront Regeneration]], has led to more affluent people moving back to live in the centre of Glasgow, fuelling allegations of [[gentrification]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_41198_en.pdf |title=Housing regeneration in Glasgow: Gentrification and upward neighbourhood trajectories in a post-industrial city |publisher=eSharp |year=2006 |access-date=10 July 2008 |first=Zhan |last=McIntyre |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910115209/http://www.gla.ac.uk/media/media_41198_en.pdf |archive-date=10 September 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2008, the city was listed by [[Lonely Planet]] as one of the world's top 10 tourist cities.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/oct/15/glasgow-scotland |title=Lonely Planet guide rates Glasgow as one of the world's top 10 cities |access-date=15 October 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=London |first=Severin |last=Carrell |date=15 October 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140119015641/http://www.theguardian.com/travel/2008/oct/15/glasgow-scotland |archive-date=19 January 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Although Glasgow [[Municipal corporation|Corporation]] had been a pioneer in the [[Municipal socialism|municipal socialist]] movement from the late-nineteenth century, since the [[Representation of the People Act 1918]], Glasgow increasingly supported [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] ideas and politics at a national level. The [[Politics of Glasgow|city council]] was controlled by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] for over thirty years, since the decline of the [[Progressives (Scotland)|Progressives]]. Since 2007, when local government elections in Scotland began to use the [[single transferable vote]] rather than the [[First-past-the-post voting|first-past-the-post system]], the dominance of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] within the city started to decline. As a result of the [[2017 United Kingdom local elections]], the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] was able to form a minority administration ending Labour's thirty-seven years of uninterrupted control.<ref>{{cite web|title=Councillor Eva Bolander chosen as Glasgow's Lord Provost|url=https://www.glasgow.gov.uk/index.aspx?articleid=21216|website=Glasgow City Council|access-date=20 May 2017|language=en|date=18 May 2017}}</ref>

In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] and the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]], the city's frequent strikes and militant organisations caused serious alarm at [[Her Majesty's Government|Westminster]], with one uprising in January 1919, the [[Battle of George Square]], prompting [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Lloyd George]] to deploy 10,000 soldiers and tanks on the city's streets. A huge demonstration in the city's [[George Square]] on 31 January ended in violence, known as the [[Battle of George Square]], after the [[Riot Act]] was read.<ref>{{cite news|last=Barclay|first=Gordon|date=2018|title='Duties in aid of the civil power': the Deployment of the Army to Glasgow, 31 January to 17 February 1919|work=Journal of Scottish Historical Studies, 38.2, 2018, 261-292|volume=38|issue=2|pages=261–292|url=https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/jshs.2018.0248|url-status=live|access-date=17 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200817000000/https://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/jshs.2018.0248|archive-date=17 August 2020|doi=10.3366/jshs.2018.0248}} [https://www.academia.edu/40520744 Alt URL]</ref>

[[Industrial action]] at the shipyards gave rise to the "[[Red Clydeside]]" epithet. During the 1930s, Glasgow was the main base of the [[Independent Labour Party]]. Towards the end of the twentieth century, it became a centre of the struggle against the [[Poll tax (Great Britain)|poll tax]]; which was introduced in Scotland a whole year before the rest of the United Kingdom and also served as the main base of the [[Scottish Socialist Party]], another left-wing political party in Scotland. The city has not had a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP since the [[1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election|1982 Hillhead by-election]], when the [[Social Democratic Party|SDP]] took the seat, which was in Glasgow's most affluent area. The fortunes of the Conservative Party continued to decline into the twenty-first century, winning only one of the 79 councillors on Glasgow City Council in [[2012 Glasgow City Council election|2012]], despite having been the controlling party (as the [[Progressives (Scotland)|Progressives]]) from 1969 to 1972 when Sir Donald Liddle was the last non-Labour [[Lord Provost of Glasgow|Lord Provost]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSS00035 |title=Sir Donald Liddle |date=2004 |website=The Glasgow Story |access-date=19 February 2018}}</ref>

Glasgow is represented in both the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in [[London]], and the [[Scottish Parliament]] in Holyrood, [[Edinburgh]]. At Westminster, it is represented by seven [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), all elected at least once every five years to represent individual constituencies, using the first-past-the-post system of voting. In Holyrood, Glasgow is represented by sixteen [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSPs), of whom nine are elected to represent individual constituencies once every four years using first-past-the-post, and seven are elected as additional regional members, by proportional representation. Since the [[2016 Scottish Parliament election]], Glasgow is represented at Holyrood by 9 [[Scottish National Party]] MSPs, 4 [[Scottish Labour Party|Labour]] MSPs, 2 [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservative]] MSPs and 1 [[Scottish Green Party|Scottish Green]] MSP. In the European Parliament, the city formed part of the [[Scotland (European Parliament constituency)|Scotland constituency]], which elected six [[Member of the European Parliament|Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) prior to [[Brexit]].<ref>{{cite news| url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-48044192| publisher=BBC | title=Who are the MEP candidates in Scotland? | date=25 April 2019}}</ref>

Since Glasgow is covered and operates under two separate central governments, the devolved Scottish Parliament and UK Government, they determine various matters that Glasgow City Council is not responsible for. The [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow electoral region of the Scottish Parliament]] covers the Glasgow City council area, a north-western part of [[South Lanarkshire]] and a small eastern portion of [[Renfrewshire]]. It elects nine of the parliament's 73 [[first past the post]] constituency members and seven of the 56 [[Mixed member proportional representation|additional members]]. Both kinds of member are known as [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs)]]. The system of election is designed to produce a form of [[proportional representation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.parliament.scot/-/media/files/spice/factsheets/parliamentary-business/scottish-parliament-electoral-system-12-may-2021.pdf|title=Scottish Parliament electoral system|publisher=Scottish Parliament|access-date=15 October 2022}}</ref>

The first past the post seats were created in 1999 with the names and boundaries of then existing [[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]] ([[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]) constituencies. In 2005, the number of Westminster [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) representing Scotland was cut to 59, with new constituencies being formed, while the existing number of [[Member of the Scottish Parliament|MSPs]] was retained at Holyrood. In the [[2011 Scottish Parliament election]], the boundaries of the Glasgow region were redrawn.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.bcomm-scotland.independent.gov.uk/1st_holyrood/rev_rec_regions/regions_revised_recommendations_map_A2.pdf |title=First Periodic Review of Scottish Parliament Boundaries.

Currently, the nine Scottish Parliament constituencies in the Glasgow electoral region are:
* [[Glasgow Anniesland (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Anniesland]]
* [[Glasgow Cathcart (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Cathcart]]
* [[Glasgow Kelvin (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Kelvin]]
* [[Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Maryhill and Springburn]]

* [[Glasgow Shettleston (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Shettleston]]
* [[Glasgow Southside (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Southside]]
* [[Rutherglen (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Rutherglen]]

At the [[2021 Scottish Parliament election]], all nine of these constituencies were won by [[Scottish National Party]] (SNP) candidates. On the regional vote, the Glasgow electoral region is represented by four [[Scottish Labour|Labour]] MSPs, two [[Scottish Conservative Party|Conservative]] MSPs and one [[Scottish Green Party|Green]] MSP.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.emb.scot/news/article/22/full-votes-and-seats-by-party-etc-spe21|title=Full votes and seats by party etc - SPE21|date=9 May 2021|work=Electoral Management Board for Scotland|access-date=30 May 2021}}</ref>

Following reform of constituencies of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]] ([[Palace of Westminster|Westminster]]) in 2005, which reduced the number of Scottish [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs), the current Westminster constituencies representing Glasgow are:
* [[Glasgow Central (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Central]]

Following the [[2014 Scottish independence referendum]], in which 53.49% of the electorate of Glasgow voted in favour of Scottish independence; the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]] won every seat in the city at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], including a record-breaking 39.3% swing from Labour to SNP in the [[Glasgow North East (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow North East]] constituency.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871 |title=Election 2015: SNP wins 56 of 59 seats in Scots landslide |access-date=21 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521003643/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2015-scotland-32635871 |archive-date=21 May 2015 |url-status=live |date=8 May 2015 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

Glasgow is located on the banks of the River Clyde, in [[Strathclyde|West Central]] Scotland. Another important river is the [[River Kelvin|Kelvin]], a tributary of the River Clyde, whose name was used in creating the title of [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|Baron Kelvin]] the renowned physicist for whom the [[Kelvin|SI unit of temperature]], Kelvin, is named.

The [[burgh]] of Glasgow was historically in [[Lanarkshire]], but close to the border with [[Renfrewshire]]. When elected county councils were established in 1890, Glasgow was deemed capable of running its own affairs and so was excluded from the administrative area of Lanarkshire County Council, whilst remaining part of Lanarkshire for [[lieutenancy areas of Scotland|lieutenancy]] and judicial purposes.<ref>{{cite book |title=Guide to local government in parishes, counties and burghs |date=1892 |publisher=Royal College of Physicians |location=Edinburgh |pages=xxiii–xxx |url=https://archive.org/details/b21905678/page/n29/mode/2up |access-date=31 December 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The County Council Magazine |date=1890 |publisher=F.

Despite its northerly latitude, similar to that of [[Moscow]], Glasgow's climate is classified as [[Oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfb'').
Data is available online for 3 official weather stations in the Glasgow area: Paisley, Abbotsinch and Bishopton. All are located to the west of the city, in neighbouring Renfrewshire.
Owing to its westerly position and proximity to the Atlantic Ocean, Glasgow is one of Scotland's milder areas. Winter temperatures are usually higher than in most places of equal latitude away from the UK, due to the warming influence of the [[Gulf Stream]]. However, this results in less distinct seasons as compared to continental Western Europe. At [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], the annual precipitation averages {{cvt|1245|mm|1}}. Glasgow has been named as the rainiest city of the UK, having an average of 170 days of rain a year.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/glasgow-named-britains-rainiest-city-14510570 |title=Glasgow named as Britain's rainiest city |first=Jennifer |last=Russell |date=9 April 2018 |website=glasgowlive |access-date=16 March 2019 |archive-date=22 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122084804/https://www.glasgowlive.co.uk/news/glasgow-news/glasgow-named-britains-rainiest-city-14510570 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/britains-rainiest-cities-revealed-good-news-for-londoners-9803812.html |title=Britain's rainiest cities revealed – and it's good news for Londoners |date=18 October 2014 |website=The Independent |access-date=5 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605114210/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/britains-rainiest-cities-revealed-good-news-for-londoners-9803812.html |archive-date=5 June 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Winters are cool and overcast, with a January mean of {{cvt|5.0|°C|1}}, though lows sometimes fall below freezing. Since 2000 Glasgow has experienced few very cold, snowy and harsh winters where temperatures have fallen much below freezing. The most extreme instances have however seen temperatures around {{cvt|-12|°C}} in the area. Snowfall accumulation is infrequent and short-lived. The spring months (March to May) are usually mild and often quite pleasant. Many of Glasgow's trees and plants begin to flower at this time of the year and parks and gardens are filled with spring colours. During the summer months (June to August) the weather can vary considerably from day to day, ranging from relatively cool and wet to quite warm with the odd sunny day. Long dry spells of warm weather are generally quite scarce. Overcast and humid conditions without rain are frequent. Generally the weather pattern is quite unsettled and erratic during these months, with only occasional heatwaves. The warmest month is usually July, with average highs above {{cvt|20|°C}}. Summer days can occasionally reach up to 27&nbsp;°C (81&nbsp;°F), and very rarely exceed 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F). Autumns are generally cool to mild with increasing precipitation. During early autumn there can be some settled periods of weather and it can feel pleasant with mild temperatures and some sunny days.

The official Met Office data series goes back to 1959 and shows that there only have been a few warm and no hot summers in Glasgow, in stark contrast to areas further south in Great Britain and eastwards in Europe.

In the 1950s, the population of the City of Glasgow area peaked at 1,089,000. Glasgow was then one of the most densely populated cities in the world. After the 1960s, clearances of poverty-stricken inner city areas like the [[Gorbals]] and relocation to "[[New town#United Kingdom|new towns]]" such as [[East Kilbride]] and [[Cumbernauld]] led to population decline. In addition, the boundaries of the city were changed twice during the late-twentieth century, making direct comparisons difficult.

The urban area continues to expand beyond the city council boundaries into surrounding suburban areas, encompassing around {{cvt|400|sqmi|km2|-1}} of all adjoining suburbs, if [[commuter town]]s and villages are included.<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/agglo/ United Kingdom: Agglomerations] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200929223604/https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/agglo/ |date=29 September 2020}}, CityPopulation.de</ref> There are two distinct definitions for the population of Glasgow: the '''Glasgow City Council Area''' which lost the districts of [[Rutherglen]] and [[Cambuslang]] to [[South Lanarkshire]] in 1996, and the '''[[Greater Glasgow]] Urban Area''' which includes the conurbation around the city (however in the 2016 definitions<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/cities/ua/ United Kingdom: Countries and Major Urban Areas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601080826/http://citypopulation.de/UK-UA.html |date=1 June 2019}}, CityPopulation.de</ref> the aforementioned Rutherglen and Cambuslang were included along with the likes of [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], [[Clydebank]], [[Newton Mearns]], [[Bearsden]] and [[Stepps]] but not others with no continuity of populated postcodes – although in some cases the gap is small – the excluded nearby settlements including [[Barrhead]], [[Erskine]] and [[Kirkintilloch]] plus a large swathe of Lanarkshire which had been considered contiguous with Glasgow in previous definitions: the '[[List of cities and towns in Scotland|settlements]]' named Coatbridge & Airdrie, Hamilton and Motherwell & Wishaw, each containing a number of distinct smaller localities).<ref name="NRS"/>

Glasgow's population influx in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries was related to economic expansion as well as internally generated growth with the vast majority of newcomers to the city from outside Scotland being from [[Ireland]], especially the north western counties of [[County Donegal|Donegal]], [[County Fermanagh|Fermanagh]], [[County Tyrone|Tyrone]] and [[County Londonderry|Londonderry]]. In the 1881 UK Census, 83% of the population was born in Scotland, 13% in Ireland, 3% in England and 1% elsewhere. By 1911, the city was no longer gaining population by migration. The demographic percentages in the 1951 UK census were: born in Scotland 93%, Ireland 3%, England 3% and elsewhere 1%.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> In the early twentieth century, many [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanian]] refugees began to settle in Glasgow and at its height in the 1950s; there were around 10,000 in the Glasgow area.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1692714,00.html |title=Lithuanians in Glasgow |date=23 January 2006 |work=The Guardian |access-date=9 July 2007 |location=London |archive-date=22 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211122084725/https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/jan/23/britishidentity.features117 |url-status=live}}</ref> Many [[Italian Scots]] also settled in Glasgow, originating from provinces like [[Frosinone]] in [[Lazio]] and [[Lucca]] in north-west [[Tuscany]] at this time, many originally working as "[[Hokey pokey (ice cream)|Hokey Pokey]]" men.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Gray |first1=Alastair |last2=Moffat |first2=William |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GGhvmMCbQLUC&pg=PA39 |title=A History of Scotland |chapter=Departures and Arrivals |access-date=9 July 2007 |page=39 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |year=1989 |edition=Rev |orig-year=1985 |isbn=978-0199170630 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801230846/https://books.google.com/books?id=GGhvmMCbQLUC&pg=PA39 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the 1960s and 1970s, many [[Asians]] also settled in Glasgow, mainly in the [[Pollokshields]] area. These number 30,000 [[Pakistani people|Pakistanis]], 15,000 [[Indian people|Indians]] and 3,000 [[Bangladeshi people|Bangladeshis]] as well as [[Cantonese people|Chinese]] people, many of whom settled in the [[Garnethill]] area of the city.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The city is also home to some 8,406 (1.42%) [[Polish people|Poles]].<ref name=crer>{{cite web |url=http://www.crer.org.uk/Census/GCCCensus2011.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170403043038/http://www.crer.org.uk/Census/GCCCensus2011.pdf |archive-date=3 April 2017 |title=2011 Population census data |website=crer.org.uk}}</ref> Since 2000, the UK government has pursued a policy of dispersal of [[Immigration to the United Kingdom since 1922|asylum seekers]] to ease pressure on social housing in the [[London]] area.

[[File:(looking down) Buchanan Street, Glasgow.jpg|thumb|right|Looking down [[Buchanan Street]] towards [[St Enoch subway station]]]]

The [[Glasgow city centre|city centre]] is bounded by High Street at [[Glasgow Cross]] the historic centre of civic life, up to [[Glasgow Cathedral]] at Castle Street; Saltmarket including [[Glasgow Green]] and [[St Andrew's Square, Glasgow|St Andrew's Square]] to the east; Clyde Street and Broomielaw (along the River Clyde) to the south; and Charing Cross and Elmbank Street, beyond [[Blythswood Square]] to the west. The northern boundary (from east to west) follows Cathedral Street to North Hanover Street and [[George Square]]. The city centre is based on a [[grid plan|grid system]] of streets on the north bank of the River Clyde. The heart of the city is [[George Square]], site of many of [[Public statues in Glasgow|Glasgow's public statues]] and the elaborate Victorian [[Glasgow City Chambers]], headquarters of [[Politics of Glasgow|Glasgow City Council]].

Most offices, and the largest offices and international headquarters, are in the distinctive streets immediately west of Buchanan Street, starting around 1800 as townhouses, in the architecturally important streets embracing [[Blythswood Hill]], Blythswood Holm further down and now including the [[Broomielaw]] next to the Clyde. To the south and west are the shopping precincts of [[Argyle Street, Glasgow|Argyle Street]], [[Sauchiehall Street]] and [[Buchanan Street]], the last featuring more upmarket retailers and winner of the Academy of Urbanism "Great Street Award" 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.academyofurbanism.org.uk/awards.htm |url-status=dead |publisher=The Academy of Urbanism |title=The Urbanism Awards 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080119212642/http://www.academyofurbanism.org.uk/awards.htm |archive-date=19 January 2008 |access-date=28 May 2008}}</ref> The collection of shops around these streets accumulate to become known as "The Style Mile".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://peoplemakeglasgow.com/things-to-do/shopping |title=The Ultimate Guide to Shopping in Glasgow {{!}} People Make Glasgow {{!}} People Make Glasgow |last=Glasgow |first=People Make |website=peoplemakeglasgow.com |access-date=13 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313070855/https://peoplemakeglasgow.com/things-to-do/shopping |archive-date=13 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The main shopping areas include [[Buchanan Street]], Buchanan Galleries, linking Buchanan Street and Sauchiehall Street, and the [[St. Enoch Centre]] linking Argyle Street and [[St Enoch Square]], with the up-market [[Princes Square]], which specifically features shops such as [[Ted Baker]], Radley and Kurt Geiger.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.princessquare.co.uk/shopping |title=Shopping {{!}} Princes Square {{!}} Glasgow|website=www.princessquare.co.uk |access-date=13 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160314011636/http://www.princessquare.co.uk/shopping |archive-date=14 March 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Buchanan Galleries and other city centre locales were chosen as locations for the 2013 film [[Under the Skin (2013 film)|Under the Skin]] directed by [[Jonathan Glazer]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.movie-locations.com/movies/u/Under-The-Skin.php |title=Filming Locations for Under The Skin (2013), around Scotland. |website=The Worldwide Guide to Movie Locations |access-date=1 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190210191903/http://movie-locations.com/movies/u/Under-The-Skin.php |archive-date=10 February 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Although the Glasgow scenes were shot with hidden cameras, star [[Scarlett Johansson]] was spotted around town.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://onlocationvacations.com/2011/10/25/scarlett-johansson-begins-filming-under-the-skin-in-glasgow/ |title=Scarlett Johansson begins filming 'Under The Skin' in Glasgow |last=Christine |date=26 October 2011 |website=On Location Vacations |language=en-US |access-date=1 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227104651/http://www.onlocationvacations.com/2011/10/25/scarlett-johansson-begins-filming-under-the-skin-in-glasgow/ |archive-date=27 December 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The Italian Centre in Ingram Street also specialises in designer labels.

The city centre is home to most of Glasgow's main cultural venues: the [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]], [[Glasgow City Hall]], [[Theatre Royal, Glasgow|Theatre Royal]] (performing home of [[Scottish Opera]] and [[Scottish Ballet]]), the [[Pavilion Theatre (Glasgow)|Pavilion Theatre]], the [[King's Theatre, Glasgow|King's Theatre]], [[Glasgow Film Theatre]], [[Tron Theatre]], [[Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow|Gallery of Modern Art]] (GoMA), Mitchell Library and Theatre, the [[CCA Glasgow|Centre for Contemporary Arts]], [[McLellan Galleries]] and the [[The Lighthouse (Glasgow)|Lighthouse Museum of Architecture]]. [[Cineworld (Glasgow)|The world's tallest cinema]], the eighteen-screen [[Cineworld]], is situated on Renfrew Street. The city centre is also home to four of Glasgow's higher education institutions: the [[University of Strathclyde]], the [[Royal Conservatoire of Scotland]], [[Glasgow School of Art]] and [[Glasgow Caledonian University]], and to the largest college in Britain &ndash; the [[City of Glasgow College]] in Cathedral Street.

===Merchant City===
[[File:Glasgow Tolbooth Steeple, Glasgow.jpg|thumb|right|The Tolbooth Steeple dominates [[Glasgow Cross]] and marks the east side of the [[Merchant City]].]]

The Merchant City  is the commercial and part-residential district of the [[Merchant City]], a name coined by the historian Charles Oakley in the 1960s. This had started as a residential district of the wealthy city merchants involved in international trade and the textile industries in the 18th and early 19th centuries, with their warehouses nearby, including the [[Tobacco Lords]] from whom many of the streets take their name. With its mercantile wealth, and continuing growth even before the [[Industrial Revolution]], the city expanded by creating the New Town around [[George Square]], soon followed by the New Town of Blythswood on [[Blythswood Hill]] which includes [[Blythswood Square]].<ref>'''Glasgow's Blythswood''', by Graeme Smith, 2021 www.blythswoodsmith.co.uk</ref> The original medieval centre around Glasgow Cross and the High Street was left behind.

Glasgow Cross, situated at the junction of [[High Street (Glasgow)|High Street]], leading up to [[Glasgow Cathedral]], Gallowgate, [[Trongate]] and Saltmarket was the original centre of the city, symbolised by its [[Mercat cross]]. Glasgow Cross encompasses the Tolbooth Steeple, all that remains of the original [[Glasgow Tolbooth]], which was demolished in 1921. Moving northward up High Street towards [[Rottenrow]] and [[Townhead]] lies the 15th century [[Glasgow Cathedral]] and the [[Provand's Lordship]]. Due to growing industrial pollution levels in the mid-to-late 19th century, the area fell out of favour with residents.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgowmerchantcity.net/history1.htm |title=Glasgow's Merchant City: Historical Development |publisher=Merchant City Initiative |year=2008 |access-date=29 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513203125/http://www.glasgowmerchantcity.net/history1.htm |archive-date=13 May 2008}}</ref>

From the 1980s onwards, the Merchant City has been rejuvenated with [[Scandinavian Scotland|luxury city centre]] flats and [[warehouse conversion]]s. This regeneration has supported an increasing number of cafés and restaurants.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/4 |title=Merchant City Glasgow: Restaurants and Cafés |publisher=Merchant City Glasgow&nbsp;– Merchant City Initiative |year=2008 |access-date=30 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616150025/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/4 |archive-date=16 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The area is also home to a number of high end boutique style shops and some of Glasgow's most upmarket stores.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/7 |title=Merchant City Glasgow: Shops |publisher=Merchant City Glasgow&nbsp;– Merchant City Initiative |year=2008 |access-date=30 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616150040/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/7 |archive-date=16 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Merchant City is one centre of Glasgow's growing "cultural quarter", based on King Street, the Saltmarket and [[Trongate]], and at the heart of the annual [[Merchant City Festival]]. The area has supported a growth in art galleries, the origins of which can be found in the late 1980s when it attracted artist-led organisations that could afford the cheap rents required to operate in vacant manufacturing or retail spaces.<ref name=autogenerated4>{{cite web |url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/2 |title=Merchant City Glasgow: Galleries and Art |publisher=Merchant City Glasgow&nbsp;– Merchant City Initiative |year=2008 |access-date=30 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616150015/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/2 |archive-date=16 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The artistic and cultural potential of the Merchant City as a "cultural quarter" was harnessed by independent arts organisations and [[Glasgow City Council]],<ref name=autogenerated4/> and the recent development of Trongate 103, which houses galleries, workshops, artist studios and production spaces, is considered a major outcome of the continued partnership between both.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trongate103.com/ |title=Trongate 103 |year=2008 |access-date=30 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081101113439/http://www.trongate103.com/ |archive-date=1 November 2008}}</ref> The area also contains a number of theatres and concert venues, including the [[Tron Theatre]], the Old Fruitmarket, the Trades Hall, St. Andrew's in the Square, Merchant Square, and the [[Glasgow City Hall|City Halls]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/1 |title=Merchant City Glasgow: Venues and Theatres |publisher=Merchant City Glasgow&nbsp;– Merchant City Initiative |year=2008 |access-date=30 July 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080616150010/http://www.merchantcityglasgow.com/categories/1 |archive-date=16 June 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===West End===
[[File:Side View of the Kelvingrove Art Museum.JPG|thumb|right|[[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]] is Glasgow's premier museum and art gallery, housing one of Europe's best civic art collections.]]

Glasgow's West End grew firstly to and around [[Blythswood Square]] and [[Garnethill]], extending then to [[Park District, Glasgow|Woodlands Hill]] and [[Woodlands, Glasgow|Great Western Road]]. It is a district of elegant townhouses and tenements with cafés, tea rooms, bars, boutiques, upmarket hotels, clubs and restaurants in the hinterland of [[Kelvingrove Park]], the [[University of Glasgow]], [[Glasgow Botanic Gardens]] and the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]], focused especially on the area's main thoroughfares of Argyle Street ([[Finnieston]]), Great Western Road and [[Byres Road]]. The area is popular with tourists and students. The West End includes residential areas of [[Hillhead]], [[Dowanhill]], [[Kelvingrove Park|Kelvingrove]], [[Kelvinside]], [[Hyndland]], [[Broomhill, Glasgow|Broomhill]], [[Scotstoun]], [[Jordanhill]], [[Kelvindale]], [[Anniesland]]
and [[Partick]]. The name is also increasingly being used to refer to any area to the west of [[Charing Cross, Glasgow|Charing Cross]]. The West End is bisected by the [[River Kelvin]], which flows from the [[Campsie Fells]] in the north and confluences with the River Clyde at Yorkhill Quay.

The spire of [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir George Gilbert Scott]]'s [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow University]] main building (the second largest [[Gothic Revival]] building in Great Britain) is a major landmark, and can be seen from miles around, sitting atop Gilmorehill. The university itself is the fourth oldest in the [[English-speaking world]]. Much of the city's student population is based in the West End, adding to its cultural vibrancy. The area is also home to the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], [[Hunterian Museum and Art Gallery]], [[Kelvin Hall]] museums and research facilities, stores, and community sport. Adjacent to the Kelvin Hall was the [[Glasgow Museum of Transport|Museum of Transport]], which reopened in 2010 after moving to a new location on a former dockland site at [[Glasgow Harbour]] where the River Kelvin flows into the Clyde. The new building is built to a design by [[Zaha Hadid]]. The [[West End Festival]], one of Glasgow's largest festivals, is held annually in June.

Glasgow is the home of the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre|SEC Centre]], Great Britain's largest exhibition and conference centre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.conferences-uk.org.uk/Glasgow.asp?venue=Scottish%20Exhibition%20and%20Conference%20Centre |title=Glasgow Conferences Venues UK |publisher=Conferences-uk.org.uk |date=17 July 1995 |access-date=12 September 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111093547/http://www.conferences-uk.org.uk/Glasgow.asp?venue=Scottish%20Exhibition%20and%20Conference%20Centre |archive-date=11 January 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.secc.co.uk/ |title=The home of the Scottish Exhibition + Conference Centre |publisher=SECC |access-date=12 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090907095647/http://www.secc.co.uk/ |archive-date=7 September 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.venuefinder.com/venues/scottish_exhibition_+_conference_centre/V8654/meeting-rooms/ |title=Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110513101220/http://www.venuefinder.com/venues/scottish_exhibition_+_conference_centre/V8654/meeting-rooms/ |archive-date= 13 May 2011}}</ref> On 30 September 2013, a major expansion of the SECC facilities at the former Queen's Dock by [[Foster and Partners]] officially opened – the 13,000-seat [[The Hydro|Hydro]] arena.

The East End extends from [[Glasgow Cross]] in the [[City Centre of Glasgow|City Centre]] to the boundary with [[North Lanarkshire|North]] and [[South Lanarkshire]]. It is home to the [[Glasgow Barrowland market]], popularly known as "The Barras",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgow-barrowland.com/ballroom.htm |title=The Official Glasgow Barrowland Ballroom Site |publisher=Glasgow Barrowland |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090415073429/http://www.glasgow-barrowland.com/ballroom.htm |archive-date=15 April 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Barrowland Ballroom]], [[Glasgow Green]], and [[Celtic Park]], home of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic FC]]. Many of the original sandstone tenements remain in this district. The East End was once a major industrial centre, home to [[Sir William Arrol & Co.]], [[James Templeton & Co]] and [[William Beardmore and Company]]. A notable local employer continues to be the [[Wellpark Brewery]], home of [[Tennent's Lager]].

The [[Glasgow Necropolis]] Garden Cemetery was created by the Merchants House on a hill above the [[Glasgow Cathedral|cathedral]] in 1831.

There are two late 18th century tenements in Gallowgate. Dating from 1771 and 1780, both have been well restored. The construction of Charlotte Street was financed by [[David Dale]], whose former scale can be gauged by the one remaining house, now run by the [[National Trust for Scotland]]. Further along Charlotte Street there stands a modern [[Gillespie, Kidd & Coia]] building of some note. Once a school, it has been converted into offices. Surrounding these buildings are a series of innovative housing developments conceived as "Homes for the Future", part of a project during the city's year as UK City of Architecture and Design in 1999.<ref>{{cite web |author=Glasgow Architecture |url=http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/homes_for_the_future_glasgow.htm |title=Homes for the Future, 1999 |publisher=Glasgow Architecture |year=1999 |access-date=12 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604161655/http://www.glasgowarchitecture.co.uk/homes_for_the_future_glasgow.htm |archive-date=4 June 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

East of Glasgow Cross is [[St Andrew's in the Square]], the oldest post-Reformation church in Scotland, built in 1739–1757 and displaying a Presbyterian grandeur befitting the church of the city's wealthy [[Tobacco Lords|tobacco merchants]]. Also close by is the more modest [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Episcopalian]] [[St Andrew's-by-the-Green]], the oldest Episcopal church in Scotland. The Episcopalian St Andrew's was also known as the "Whistlin' Kirk" due to it being the first church after the Reformation to own an organ. Overlooking Glasgow Green is the façade of [[Templeton On The Green]], featuring vibrant [[polychrome|polychromatic]] brickwork intended to evoke the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]].<ref name=autogenerated5>{{cite web |url=http://www.princes-regeneration.org/bestpractice/tempcarp.htm |title=Templeton's Carpet Factory, Glasgow |website=princes-regeneration.org |access-date=20 June 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019191840/http://www.princes-regeneration.org/bestpractice/tempcarp.htm |archive-date=19 October 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The extensive [[Tollcross, Glasgow|Tollcross Park]] was originally developed from the estate of James Dunlop, the owner of a local steelworks. His large [[Scots Baronial Style architecture|baronial]] mansion was built in 1848 by [[David Bryce]], which later housed the city's Children's Museum until the 1980s. Today, the mansion is a sheltered housing complex. The new [[National Indoor Sports Arena and Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome|Scottish National Indoor Sports Arena]], a modern replacement for the [[Kelvin Hall]], is in [[Dalmarnock]]. The area was the site of the [[Olympic Village|Athletes' Village]] for the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]], located adjacent to the new indoor sports arena.

The East End Healthy Living Centre (EEHLC) was established in mid-2005 at Crownpoint Road with Lottery Funding and City grants to serve community needs in the area.

===South Side===
[[File:NS5765 The Clyde, and 'Squinty' bridge, Glasgow.jpg|thumb|right|[[Pacific Quay]] sits within the south side of Glasgow, and is home to some of the city's largest businesses and employers.]]

Glasgow's South Side sprawls out south of the Clyde. The adjoining urban area includes some of Greater Glasgow's most affluent suburban towns, such as [[Newton Mearns]], [[Clarkston, East Renfrewshire|Clarkston]], and [[Giffnock]], all of which are in [[East Renfrewshire]], as well as [[Thorntonhall]] in [[South Lanarkshire]]. [[Newlands, Glasgow|Newlands]] and [[Dumbreck]] are examples of high-value residential districts within the city boundaries. There are many areas containing a high concentration of sandstone tenements like [[Shawlands]], which is considered the "Heart of the Southside", with other examples being [[Battlefield, Glasgow|Battlefield]], [[Govanhill]] and [[Mount Florida]].<ref>{{cite web |title=No surprise from the community that Shawlands is coolest spot |url=https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/23042723.no-surprise-community-shawlands-coolest-spot/ |website=Herald Scotland |date=12 October 2022 |access-date=24 October 2022}}</ref> The large suburb of [[Pollokshields]] comprises both a quiet western part with undulating tree-lined boulevards lined with expensive villas, and a busier eastern part with a high-density grid of tenements and small shops. The south side also includes some post-war housing estates of various sizes such as [[Toryglen]], [[Pollok]], [[Castlemilk]] and [[Arden, Glasgow|Arden]]. The towns of [[Cambuslang]] and [[Rutherglen]] were included in the City of Glasgow district from 1975 to 1996, but are now in the [[South Lanarkshire]] council area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1973/oct/22/new-local-government-areas |title=New Local Government areas |publisher=[[Hansard]] |date=22 October 1973 |access-date=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181104050038/https://api.parliament.uk/historic-hansard/commons/1973/oct/22/new-local-government-areas |archive-date=4 November 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.theglasgowstory.com/story/?id=TGSFG |title=Modern Times: 1950s to The Present Day > Neighbourhoods |author=Irene Maver |website=The Glasgow Story |access-date=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029031254/http://www.theglasgowstory.com/story/?id=TGSFG |archive-date=29 October 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/glasgow/ |title=Scotland's Landscape: City of Glasgow |publisher=[[BBC]] |access-date=4 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170317174830/http://www.bbc.co.uk/scotland/landscapes/glasgow/ |archive-date=17 March 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Although predominantly residential, the area does have several notable public buildings including, [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]'s [[Scotland Street School Museum]] and [[House for an Art Lover]]; the [[Burrell Collection]] in [[Pollok Country Park]]; [[Alexander "Greek" Thomson]]'s [[Holmwood House]] villa; the National Football Stadium [[Hampden Park]] in [[Mount Florida]] (home of [[Queen's Park F.C.|Queens Park FC]]) and [[Ibrox Stadium]] (home of [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers FC]]).

The former docklands site at [[Pacific Quay]] on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite the SECC, is the site of the [[Glasgow Science Centre]] and the headquarters of [[BBC Scotland]] and [[STV Group (Scotland)|STV Group]] (owner of [[STV (TV network)|STV]]), in a new purpose-built digital media campus.

In addition, several new bridges spanning the River Clyde have been built, including the [[Clyde Arc]] known by locals as the Squinty Bridge at [[Pacific Quay]] and others at [[Tradeston]] and Springfield Quay.

The South Side also includes many public parks, including [[Linn Park, Glasgow, Scotland|Linn Park]], [[Queen's Park, Glasgow|Queen's Park]], and [[Bellahouston Park]] and several golf clubs, including the championship course at [[Haggs Castle]]. The South Side is also home to the large [[Pollok Country Park]], which was awarded the accolade of Europe's Best Park 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/Parks_Outdoors/Parks_gardens/pollokparkbritainsbestpark.htm |title=Pollok Park Britain's Best Park |access-date=20 June 2008 |website=Glasgow City Council |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615135645/http://www.glasgow.gov.uk/en/Residents/Parks_Outdoors/Parks_gardens/pollokparkbritainsbestpark.htm |archive-date=15 June 2008}}</ref> The southside also directly borders [[Rouken Glen|Rouken Glen Park]] in neighbouring [[Giffnock]]. Pollok Park is Glasgow's largest park and until the early 2000s was the only country park in the city's boundary. In the early 2000s the [[Dams to Darnley Country Park]] was designated, although half of the park is in [[East Renfrewshire]]. As of 2021 the facilities at the still new park are quite lacking.

[[Govan]] is a district and former burgh in the south-western part of the city. It is situated on the south bank of the River Clyde, opposite [[Partick]]. It was an administratively independent Police Burgh from 1864 until it was incorporated into the expanding city of Glasgow in 1912. Govan has a legacy as an engineering and [[shipbuilding]] centre of international repute and is home to one of two [[BAE Systems Surface Ships|BAE Systems Surface Ships shipyards]] on the River Clyde and the [[precision engineering]] firm, [[Thales Optronics]]. It is also home to the [[Queen Elizabeth University Hospital]], one of the largest hospitals in the country, and the maintenance depot for the [[Glasgow Subway]] system. The wider Govan area includes the districts of [[Ibrox, Glasgow|Ibrox]], [[Cessnock, Glasgow|Cessnock]], [[Kinning Park]] and [[Kingston, Glasgow|Kingston]].

===North Glasgow===
[[File:Ruchill Church at canal.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ruchill Church Hall|Ruchill Church]], seen from the [[Forth and Clyde Canal]]]]
North Glasgow extends out from the north of the city centre towards the affluent suburbs of [[Bearsden]], [[Milngavie]] and [[Bishopbriggs]] in [[East Dunbartonshire]] and [[Clydebank]] in [[West Dunbartonshire]]. The area also contains some of the city's poorest residential areas.

This has led to large-scale redevelopment of much of the poorer housing stock in north Glasgow, and the wider regeneration of many areas, such as [[Ruchill]], which have been transformed; many run-down tenements have now been refurbished or replaced by modern [[housing estate]]s. Much of the housing stock in north Glasgow is rented [[social housing]], with a high proportion of high-rise tower blocks, managed by the North Glasgow Housing Association trading as NG Homes and [[Glasgow Housing Association]].

[[Maryhill]] consists of well maintained traditional sandstone tenements. Although historically a working class area, its borders with the upmarket West End of the city mean that it is relatively wealthy compared to the rest of the north of the city, containing affluent areas such as [[Maryhill Park]] and [[North Kelvinside]]. Maryhill is also the location of [[Firhill Stadium]], home of [[Partick Thistle F.C.]] since 1909. The [[Scottish Junior Football Association|junior]] team, [[Maryhill F.C.]] are also located in this part of north Glasgow.

The [[Forth and Clyde Canal]] passes through this part of the city, and at one stage formed a vital part of the local economy. It was for many years polluted and largely unused after the decline of heavy industry, but recent efforts to regenerate and re-open the canal to navigation have seen it rejuvenated, including art campuses at Port Dundas.

[[Sighthill, Glasgow|Sighthill]] was home to Scotland's largest [[asylum seeker]] community but the area is now regenerated as part of the Youth Olympic Games bid.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nicoll |first1=Vivienne |title=Starting gun sounds for regeneration of Sighthill |url=http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/starting-gun-sounds-for-regeneration-of-sighthill-158767n.23892373 |website=The Evening Times |date=8 April 2014 |access-date=26 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114753/http://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/starting-gun-sounds-for-regeneration-of-sighthill-158767n.23892373 |archive-date=26 August 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

A huge part of the economic life of Glasgow was once located in [[Springburn]], where the [[Saracen Foundry]], engineering works of firms like [[Charles Tennant]] and locomotive workshops employed many Glaswegians. Glasgow dominated this type of manufacturing, with 25% of all the world's locomotives being built in the area at one stage. It was home to the headquarters of the [[North British Locomotive Company]]. Today part of the [[Glasgow Works]] continues in use as a railway maintenance facility, all that is left of the industry in Springburn. It is proposed for closure in 2019.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-46545455 180 jobs under threat at Glasgow rail services firm] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181217133740/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-46545455 |date=17 December 2018}} ''[[BBC News]]'' 12 December 2018</ref> [[Riddrie]] in the north east was intensively developed in the 1920s and retains several listed developments in the Art Deco style.

Glasgow is a city of significant religious diversity. The [[Church of Scotland]] and the [[Roman Catholicism in Scotland|Roman Catholic Church]] are the two largest Christian denominations in the city. There are 147 congregations in the Church of Scotland's [[Presbytery of Glasgow (Church of Scotland)|Presbytery of Glasgow]] (of which 104 are within the city boundaries, the other 43 being in adjacent areas).<ref>''Church of Scotland Yearbook 2008–09'', {{ISBN|978-0861533848}}</ref> Within the city boundaries there are 65 parishes of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Glasgow]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcag.org.uk/index.php/the-archdiocese/parishes |title=Parishes |website=www.rcag.org.uk |access-date=7 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529182730/http://www.rcag.org.uk/index.php/the-archdiocese/parishes |archive-date=29 May 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> and four parishes of the [[Diocese of Motherwell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rcdom.org.uk/parish-list |title=Diocese of Motherwell |website=Diocese of Motherwell |access-date=7 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022003424/http://www.rcdom.org.uk/parish-list |archive-date=22 October 2016 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The city has four Christian [[cathedral]]s: [[Glasgow Cathedral]], of the Church of Scotland; [[St Andrew's Cathedral, Glasgow|St Andrew's Cathedral]], of the Roman Catholic Church; [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Glasgow|St Mary's Cathedral]], of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]], and [[St Luke's Orthodox Cathedral, Glasgow|St Luke's Cathedral]], of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. The Baptist Church and Salvation Army are well represented.

The Protestant churches are the largest in number, including Baptist, Episcopalian, Methodist and Presbyterian. 32% of the population follow the Protestant Church of Scotland whilst 29% following the Roman Catholic Church, according to the 2001 census (Christians overall form 65%).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2005/11/08142443/24477 |title=Faith Communities and Local Government in Glasgow |first=St Andrew's House |last=Scottish Government |date=14 November 2005 |access-date=24 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180603063652/http://www.gov.scot/Publications/2005/11/08142443/24477 |archive-date=3 June 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Much of the city's Roman Catholic population are those of [[Irish-Scottish people|Irish ancestry]].

Glasgow is Scotland's main locus of [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] language use outside the [[Highlands and Islands]]. In 2011, 5,878 residents of the city over age 3 spoke Gaelic, amounting to 1.0% of the population.

Very little of [[medieval]] Glasgow remains; the two main landmarks from this period being the 15th-century [[Provand's Lordship]] and 13th-century [[St. Mungo's Cathedral]], although the original medieval street plan (along with many of the street names) on the eastern side of the city centre has largely survived intact. Also in the 15th century began the building of [[Cathcart Castle]], completed {{Circa|1450}} with a view over the landscape in all directions. It was at this castle [[Mary Queen of Scots]] supposedly spent the night before her defeat at the [[Battle of Langside]] in May 1568. The castle was demolished in 1980 for safety reasons. The vast majority of the central city area as seen today dates from the 19th century. As a result, Glasgow has a heritage of [[Victorian architecture]]: the [[Glasgow City Chambers]]; the main building of the [[University of Glasgow]], designed by [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir George Gilbert Scott]]; and the [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], designed by [[John William Simpson (architect)|Sir John W. Simpson]], are notable examples.

The city is notable for architecture designed by the [[Glasgow School]], the most notable exponent of that style being [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]. Mackintosh was an architect and designer in the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the main exponent of [[Art Nouveau]] in the United Kingdom, designing numerous noted Glasgow buildings such as the [[Glasgow School of Art]], [[Willow Tearooms]] and the [[Scotland Street School Museum]]. A hidden gem of Glasgow, also designed by Mackintosh, is the [[Queen's Cross Church, Glasgow|Queen's Cross Church]], the only church by the renowned artist to be built.<ref>[http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&vxChannel=SeeScot%20Places&vxClipId=1380_SMG1835&vxBitrate=300 Watch video of the church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605023607/http://www.scotlandontv.tv/scotland_on_tv/video.html?vxSiteId=60fdd544-9c52-4e17-be7e-57a2a2d76992&vxChannel=SeeScot%20Places&vxClipId=1380_SMG1835&vxBitrate=300 |date=5 June 2009}} and Interview with Stuart Robertson, Charles Rennie Mackintosh Society Director</ref>

Another architect who has had an enduring impact on the city's appearance is [[Alexander Thomson]], with notable examples including the [[Holmwood House]] villa, and likewise Sir [[John James Burnet]], awarded the R.I.B.A.'s Royal Gold Medal for his lifetime's service to architecture. The buildings reflect the wealth and self-confidence of the residents of the "Second City of the Empire". Glasgow generated immense wealth from trade and the industries that developed from the Industrial Revolution. The [[shipyard]]s, [[Naval architecture|marine engineering]], steel making, and [[heavy industry]] all contributed to the growth of the city.

Many of the city's buildings were built with red or blond [[sandstone]], but during the industrial era those colours disappeared under a pervasive black layer of soot and pollutants from the [[Furnace (house heating)|furnace]]s, until the [[Clean Air Act 1956|Clean Air Act]] was introduced in 1956. There are over 1,800 listed buildings in the city, of architectural and historical importance, and 23 Conservation Areas extending over {{Convert|1,471|ha|acre}}. Such areas include the Central Area, Dennistoun, the West End, Pollokshields – the first major planned garden suburb in Britain – Newlands and the village of Carmunnock.<ref>Glasgow City Council Planning Department reports</ref>

Modern buildings in Glasgow include the [[Glasgow Royal Concert Hall]], and along the banks of the Clyde are the [[Glasgow Science Centre]], [[OVO Hydro|The OVO Hydro]] and the [[Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre]], whose [[Clyde Auditorium]] was designed by [[Norman Foster (architect)|Sir Norman Foster]], and is colloquially known as the "[[Armadillo]]".

Glasgow has a large urban transport system, mostly managed by the [[Strathclyde Partnership for Transport]] (SPT). The city has many bus services; since [[Bus deregulation in the United Kingdom|bus deregulation]] almost all are provided by private operators, though SPT part-funds some services. The principal bus operators within the city are: [[First Glasgow]], [[McGill's Bus Services]], [[Stagecoach West Scotland]] and [[Glasgow Citybus]]. The main bus terminal in the city is [[Buchanan bus station]].

Glasgow has the most extensive [[commuter rail|urban rail]] network in the UK outside London, with rail services travelling to a large part of the [[Strathclyde|West of Scotland]]. Most lines were electrified under [[British Rail]]. All trains running within Scotland, including the local Glasgow trains, are operated by [[ScotRail]], which is owned by the [[Scottish Government]]. [[Glasgow Central railway station|Central station]] and [[Glasgow Queen Street railway station|Queen Street station]] are the two main railway terminals.

The city's suburban network is currently divided by the River Clyde and the [[Crossrail Glasgow]] initiative has been proposed to link them; it is currently awaiting funding from the Scottish Government. The city is linked to Edinburgh by [[Glasgow to Edinburgh Lines|four direct railway links]]. In addition to the suburban rail network, SPT operates the [[Glasgow Subway]]. The Subway is the United Kingdom's only completely underground [[rapid transit|metro]] system and is generally recognised as the world's third oldest underground railway after the [[London Underground]] and the [[Budapest Metro]].<ref>{{cite web |author=SPT |url=http://www.spt.co.uk/subway/facts.html |title=SPT Subway |date=16 April 1980 |access-date=12 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229231523/http://www.spt.co.uk/subway/facts.html |archive-date=29 December 2007}}</ref> Both railway and subway stations have a number of [[park and ride]] facilities.

As part of the wider regeneration along the banks of the River Clyde, a [[bus rapid transit]] system called [[Clyde Fastlink]] is operational between Glasgow City Centre to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.spt.co.uk/corporate/about/projects/fastlink/ |title=Fastlink – SPT – Corporate Information – Strathclyde Partnership for Transport |website=www.spt.co.uk |access-date=13 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170905071858/http://www.spt.co.uk/corporate/about/projects/fastlink |archive-date=5 September 2017 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Shipping===
Global-ship-management is carried out by maritime and logistics firms in Glasgow, in client companies employing over 100,000 seafarers. This reflects maritime skills over many decades and the training and education of deck officers and marine engineers from around the world at the [[City of Glasgow College]], Nautical Campus, from which graduate around one third of all such graduates in the United Kingdom.<ref name="cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk/ |title=City of Glasgow College &#124; Full Time, Part Time, Evening and Weekend College Courses |access-date=3 November 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016032603/https://www.cityofglasgowcollege.ac.uk/ |archive-date=16 October 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The main operational dock within Glasgow operated by [[Peel Group|Clydeport]] is the [[King George V Dock, Glasgow|King George V Dock]], near Braehead. Since the advent of [[Containerization|containerisation]], most other facilities, such as [[Hunterston Terminal]], are located in the deep waters of the [[Firth of Clyde#Shipping in the Firth|Firth of Clyde]], which together handle some 7.5&nbsp;million tonnes of cargo each year. Longer distant commercial sea shipping from Glasgow occurs regularly to many European destinations, including Mediterranean and Baltic ports via passage through the [[Sea of the Hebrides]].<ref>C.

===Roads===
[[File:Kingston Bridge in Glasgow.jpg|thumb|right|The [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]], which crosses the Clyde over the Kingston Bridge, is Scotland's busiest [[motorway]].]] The main M8 motorway passes around the city centre and connects with the [[M77 motorway|M77]], [[M74 motorway|M74]], [[M73 motorway|M73]] and [[M80 motorway|M80]] motorways, all of which pass within the city's boundaries. The [[A82 road|A82]] connects Glasgow to [[Argyll and Bute|Argyll]] and the western [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]]. The [[A74(M) and M74 motorways|M74]] runs directly south towards [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]].

Other strategic roads in the city include the [[Glasgow East End Regeneration Route|East End Regeneration Route]], which provides easier access to areas of the East End, linking the M8 to the extended M74.

===Airports===
[[File:GlasgowAirportFromAir.jpg|thumb|right|[[Glasgow Airport]] is the largest of the two airports that serve Glasgow]]
There are three international airports within 45 minutes travel of the city centre, as well as a centrally located seaplane terminal. Two airports are dedicated to Glasgow, and [[Edinburgh Airport]], situated on the west side of Edinburgh, is not far from Glasgow. These airports are [[Glasgow Airport]] (GLA) ({{cvt|8|mi|km|0|abbr=off|disp=or|spell=on}} west of the city centre) in Renfrewshire, [[Glasgow Prestwick Airport]] (PIK) ({{cvt|30|mi|km|sigfig=1|abbr=off|disp=or}} southwest) in South Ayrshire, [[Edinburgh Airport]] (EDI), ({{cvt|34|mi|km|abbr=off|disp=or}} east) in Edinburgh and [[Glasgow Seaplane Terminal]], by the Glasgow Science Centre on the River Clyde.

There are also several smaller, domestic and private airports around the city. There is a heliport, [[Glasgow City Heliport]], located at Stobcross Quay on the banks of the Clyde.

All of the international airports are easily accessible by public transport, with Glasgow Airport and Edinburgh Airport directly linked by bus routes from the main bus station and a direct rail connection to Glasgow Prestwick Airport from Glasgow Central Station. A series of proposals to provide a direct rail link to Glasgow International Airport have ended unsuccessfully, beginning with the [[Glasgow Airport Rail Link]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8256474.stm |title=Ministers scrap airport rail plan |work=BBC News |date=17 September 2009 |access-date=7 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728210311/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/8256474.stm |archive-date=28 July 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> As of 2019, local authorities have approved plans for a "Glasgow Metro", including a connection to the International Airport.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-51008481 |title=Glasgow Airport Metro system gets council leader approval |date=6 January 2020 |access-date=29 January 2020 |archive-date=7 January 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200107132242/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-51008481 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Like many cities in the UK, Glasgow witnessed the construction of high-rise housing in [[tower block]]s in the 1960s, along with large [[overspill estate]]s on the periphery of the city, in areas like [[Pollok]], [[Nitshill]], [[Castlemilk]], [[Easterhouse]], [[Milton, Glasgow|Milton]] and [[Drumchapel]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sustainingtowers.org/SOA-hist-drivers.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311003256/http://www.sustainingtowers.org/SOA-hist-drivers.htm |url-status=dead |title=Drivers for high rise living |archive-date=11 March 2012}}</ref> These were built to replace the decaying inner-city tenement buildings originally built for workers who migrated from the surrounding countryside, the Highlands, and the rest of the United Kingdom, particularly Ireland, to feed the local demand for labour.<ref>{{cite book |author=Brendan O'Grady |title=Exiles and Islanders: The Irish Settlers of Prince Edward Island |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y4fZZeJqqRcC&pg=PA144 |year=2004 |publisher=McGill-Queen's Press – MQUP |isbn=978-0773527683 |page=144}}</ref> The massive demand at that time outstripped the pace of new building, and many originally fine tenements often became overcrowded and unsanitary.<ref>Worksall, Frank ''The Tenement&nbsp;– a way of life''.

There is also an emergency telephone service provided by [[NHS 24]] and 24-hour access to [[general practitioner]]s through out-of-hours centres. [[Paramedic]] services are provided by the [[Scottish Ambulance Service]] and supported by voluntary bodies like the [[St. Andrew's Ambulance Association]]. A strong [[Teaching hospital|teaching]] tradition is maintained between the city's main hospitals and the [[University of Glasgow Medical School]].

All pharmacies provide a wide range of services including minor ailment advice, emergency hormonal contraception, public health advice, some provide oxygen and needle exchange.

There are private clinics and hospitals at the [[Nuffield Health|Nuffield]] in the west end and Ross Hall in the south side of the city.
