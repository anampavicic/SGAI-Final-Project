'''Talavera''', officially the '''Municipality of Talavera''' ({{langx|tl|Bayan ng Talavera}}; {{langx|ilo|Ili ti Talavera}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.info/Philippines-Luzon.html?cityid=28638|title=Cities and Municipalities urban population|website=City population|access-date=28 October 2018}}</ref> in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 132,338.

Talavera is part of [[Cabanatuan]] conurbation as adjacent urban center in the heart of [[Nueva Ecija]]. It is dubbed as the "Milk Capital" and "Food basket in Inland Luzon".

==History==
{{essay-like|section|date=June 2024}}
Specific accounts pertinent to understanding Talavera’s history and development were generally sparse. While its beginning could be traced back as far as 1846, no explicit account of its historical development was fully chartered or documented, except perhaps some fragments and rarities that somehow occasioned a kind of historic significance to its otherwise complex development. In fact, it was only during the term of then Municipal '''Mayor Romeo F. Maliwat''' in 1965 that its history was revisited and re-written. '''Mr. Tomas I. Pagaduan''', then public librarian, was commissioned and tasked to write the history of Talavera. Said history was printed and published in 1967.

Nevertheless, earlier accounts about Talavera, then known as '''Catuguian''', described it generally as being situated on “flat land and rest[ed] on the margin of the river”. The Spanish scribe Joaquin Rajal aptly characterized it as follows:

<blockquote>It lacks a church, parish house, court, and schools, and their spiritual administration is equally shared with Cabanatuan, as it has not been appointed since it was formed, […] The neighborhood, made up of Tagalogs, is composed of 5,567 souls, who are dedicated to agriculture in irrigated and rainfed land. […] its forests are rich with all kinds of wood and its extensive lands are suited for cattle grazing […].<ref>Joaquin L. Rajal. ''Memoria Acerca de La Provincia de Nueva Ecija en Filipinas.'' (Madrid: Establicimiento Tipografico de Fortanet, 1890), p. 15</ref> </blockquote>
On the whole, the history of Talavera could be associated, in some general way or other, with the history of the early Augustinian missions in lowland Nueva Ecija in 1595, particularly in Gapan.<ref>Elviro J Peres. ''Catalogo Bibliografico de los Religiosos Agustinos de la Provincia del Santisimo Nombre de Jesus de las Islas Filipinas Desde su Fundacion Hasta Nuestro Dias.'' (Manila: Establicimiento Tipografico del Colegio de Sto. Tomas, 1901, p.818)</ref> The mission in Gapan outlined the basis for the ensuing religious missions in Cabanatuan in the 1700s and later on in Catuguian, being one of its component barrios.<ref>Peres 1901, p. 819</ref> The succeeding timelines could provide a rather general view of Talavera’s history.

'''1846 – 1851: Barrio Catuguian'''

* Earliest accounts of '''Catuguian''' could be traced from the early Augustinian missions in lowland Nueva Ecija, being a component barrio of Cabanatuan.
* The establishment of a chapel or visita for religious celebration in Catuguian shaped its succeeding history.
*Its population grew after Nueva Ecija became a regular province in 1848,<ref>Enrique G. Mhartin. ''Apuntes Geograficos de las Islas Filipinas''. (Madrid: Imprenta De Ramon Angelo, 1889), p. 42</ref> from being a ''corregimiento'' in 1801.<ref>Rafael Maria de Aguilar. ''Papeles Interesantes a los Regulares que en las Islas Filipinas Administran la Cura de Almas.'' (Valladolid: En La Imprenta de la Viuda de Roldan, 1838), p. 12</ref>
* The people of Catuguian initiated a petition to  the Alcalde-Mayor of Nueva Ecija in 1852 to create an independent town by consolidating the barrios of La Torre, Concepcion, Pulong Buli (Sto. Domingo), Valle and Baloc, with Catuguian as its capital. This was sent to the Governor-General of Manila for approval.

'''1852 – 1872: From Catuguian to Talavera'''

* The petition was granted. An independent pueblo was created, with '''Catuguian''' being the capital on '''December 11, 1852.'''  
*On '''February 4, 1853''', it made another petition to the Governor General in Manila, requesting that its name be changed to Talavera, after ''Talavera de la Princesa e Coruna''.
*On '''February 14, 1853''', the petition was granted and Catuguian came to be called “Talavera”.
* On '''November 20, 1872''', through a Royal Decree issued by King Amadeo I, the Parroquia de Talavera was formally recognized and instituted.<ref>National Archives of the Philippines. ''Ereccion de los Pueblos Nueva Ecija 1779-1898''. SDS 14058, Exp. 16, S340–380b.</ref>

===Dispute with Science City of Muñoz===
 
While Talavera was undergoing significant fiscal deepening from 1996 to 1999, it entered into a seemingly intractable territorial conflict with the newly chartered special city of Muñoz, then, under the leadership of Mayor Efren L. Alvarez, over claims involving the Barangays of Bakal I, Bakal II, Bakal III and Matingkis. The latter claimed that these barangays were “replete with facts” that they once belonged to the Science City of Muñoz and as such must be annexed as its component barangays. <ref>See Mayor Efren L. Alvares, "Correspondence to Mayor Lito V. Fausto", June 27, 2001</ref> The latter further characterized that these barangays were like “uncommon arrows”, being part of the territorial boundary of Talavera, piercing the “belly of development” of the Science City of Muñoz.

Owing to this territorial dispute, the Local Government of Talavera was compelled to act to protect its territorial integrity and its sovereignty over these disputed areas.<ref>Mayor Lito V. Fausto, "Correspondence to Mayor Efren L. Alvares", September 17, 2001</ref> It passed several resolutions, affirming firmly, its sovereignty over these barangays, thereby outrightly invalidating the former’s claims over them as said barangays were annexed to Talavera as early as 1910 through Executive Order No. 39, series of 1909. In October 1998 for example, the local government of Talavera, through its Sangguniang Bayan, issued a resolution blatantly disapproving the former’s claim over the disputed barangays.<ref>SB Resolution No. 127-98, series of 1998</ref> At the same time, Barangay Resolutions from these disputed areas were issued in October 1998 as well, expressing generally, the residents’ disapproval to the annexation claims.<ref>Barangay Bakal II Resolution No. 43-98, series of 1998</ref><ref>Barangay Baka III Resolution No. 036-98, series of 1998</ref><ref>Barangay Matingkis Resolution No. 08-98, series of 1998</ref>

By February 1999, the LGU of Talavera created the “Task Force Bacal District” to address this highly tenacious concern, elevating it, in fact, to Congress for possible arbitration.<ref>See SB Resolution No. 40-99, series of 1999</ref> In March 1999, the LGU Talavera submitted to some members of Congress pertinent documents relevant to address, if not totally resolve, the problem.<ref>See Mayor Lito V. Fausto's letter to the Senate President Franklin Drillon dated September 17, 2001</ref> By the end of March 1999, because of the interventions  of some members of both Houses, and through the collective efforts of the residents of Talavera and its officials, under the leadership of then Mayor Manolito V. Fausto, the “annexation claims” were nullified vindicating, as a result, Talavera’s territorial jurisdiction and integrity. In a significant way, it was a triumphant moment for Talavera. At the same time, it was a meritorious and legitimate exercise of its sovereign powers to protect its territorial integrity as a local government unit against then rising Science City of Muñoz.

'''THE LOCAL ECONOMY'''

Talavera’s local economic activities are highly associated with the secondary sector. In other words, its primary economic base is dominated by personnel services. Its primary and tertiary economic sectors, although importantly thriving, still require further boost in investment. Economic productions in these areas, though, are more than sufficient to fuel Talavera’s local economic growth. In fact, its contributions to Talavera’s gross domestic products keep Talavera afloat. Similarly, the mobility of its combined labor force constitutes a solid employment structure for Talavera, despite some rare cases of unemployment.

'''''The Primary Sector:'''''
''Agricultural Crops and Croplands''

For Talavera, agriculture is generally viewed as an engine of development. Some studies for example report that it is an “important material base for all economies” as it produces “indispensable necessities of human life and important industrial material”.<ref>World Association for Political Economy. "Globalization, Employment and Agriculture: A Statement of the Eleventh Forum for World Association for Political Economy," ''World Review of Political Economy'', Volume 7, Number 4 (Winter, 2016)</ref> This includes, ''inter alia'', contributions like “release of labor from non-farm employment”, “increased supply of food and fiber”, “production of export surplus” as well as “generation of savings for both rural and urban areas”.<ref>{{Johnson, D. Gale. "Role of agriculture in Economic development revisited." ''Agricultural Economics'', Volume 8 (1993), p. 429</ref>

Talavera's inbred rice production from 2015 to 2021 preserves an average rice production of 42,048.14 metric tons in wet seasons, while it averages 26,580.37 metric tons in dry seasons. Its lowest production has been estimated at 31,894.40 metric tons in 2015 and it  highest production has been posted in 2020, with an annual production of 54,292.99 metric tons. On the whole, inbred rice production shows moderately increasing trend.

Hybrid rice production, meanwhile, has been observed to gain currency among farmers in Talavera. In Fact, from 2015 to 2022, its average production has been estimated at 46,617.79 metric tons during the dry season. Its  low productions average though has been observed in the wet seasons, estimated at 4,037.63 metric tons per harvest from 2015 - 2022. Nevertheless, in both wet and dry seasons, hybrid rice production post significantly increasing trends.

For one thing, most of its establishments are light industries. For another thing, its access to financial assistance or grant-in aids is relatively limited. Finally, Talavera’s secondary sector is yet to fully develop a highly competitive product that can be comparatively advantageous. Nonetheless, the sector remains stable.

'''THE TERTIARY SECTOR'''

Talavera’s tertiary sector rose by 20.72% in 2022. Registered business firms under the tertiary sector in 2022 are accounted at 1,375. It rose by 20.72%, from 1,139 to 1,375. More than half of these firms, 58.76%, are wholesale and retail industries.
