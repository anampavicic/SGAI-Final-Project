'''Centennial''' is a [[List of municipalities in Colorado#Home rule municipality|home rule municipality]] located in [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]], [[Colorado]], United States.<ref name=COMun/> The city population was 108,418 at the [[2020 United States Census]], making Centennial the [[Colorado municipalities|11th most populous municipality]] in Colorado.<ref name=2020_Census/> Centennial is a part of the [[Denver–Aurora–Lakewood, CO Metropolitan Statistical Area]] and the [[Front Range Urban Corridor]].

==History==
Centennial was formed on February 7, 2001, from portions of [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[Arapahoe County, Colorado|Arapahoe County]], including the former [[Castlewood, Colorado|Castlewood]] and [[Southglenn, Colorado|Southglenn]] [[census-designated place]]s (CDPs).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wallace |first1=Susan |title=Centennial off to fast start |url=https://extras.denverpost.com/news/election/cent0208.htm |website=Denver Post |access-date=February 19, 2020}}</ref> The citizens of the area had voted to incorporate on September 12, 2000, choosing Centennial as the official name during the vote. The name reflects Colorado's admission to the [[United States|Union]] as the 38th state in 1876, the [[century|centennial year]] of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]].<ref name="Profile for Centennial">{{cite web |url=http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=259435 |publisher=ePodunk |title=Profile for Centennial, Colorado, CO |access-date=July 6, 2012}}</ref> The state of Colorado is nicknamed the "[[Centennial State]]".<ref name="Profile for Centennial" />

[[Incorporation (municipal government)|Incorporation]] was approved by 77% of the voters, and the population of the area at over 100,000 made it the largest incorporation in U.S. history as of its creation. The city was incorporated in large part to prevent further annexations of unincorporated areas by the [[Greenwood Village, Colorado|city of Greenwood Village]] in an attempt to improve its tax base.<ref>{{cite news |last=Duran |first=Marlys |date=November 11, 1998 |title=SOUTH METRO TURF WAR CENTENNIAL WOULD BOOST ARAPAHOE COUNTY STILL WOULD RECEIVE TAXES, BUT RESPONSIBILITIES WOULD SHRINK |url=https://infoweb.newsbank.com/apps/news/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info%3Asid/infoweb.newsbank.com&svc_dat=AWNB&req_dat=0F2929A6DB0FBA6E&rft_val_format=info%3Aofi/fmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&rft_dat=document_id%3Anews%252F0EB4ECBB438000C4 |newspaper=Rocky Mountain News |location=Denver, Colorado |access-date=September 22, 2024}} </ref> The taxes generated from businesses in unincorporated portions of Arapahoe County funded the majority of the county's services, including road work. A number of court cases{{specify|date=July 2020}} eventually established the right of incorporation to take precedence over the right of annexation.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

The city was incorporated on a promise to keep city taxes at 1%. (One of the campaigns against incorporation appealed to voters to maintain the 3.8% sales tax of the unincorporated county.) According to the Centennial website, the current sales tax rate is two-and-a-half times the promised rate, at 2.5%.

In 2008, Centennial voters approved a referendum by approximately a 2-to-1 margin making Centennial a [[home rule in the United States|home rule]] city.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_9546257 |work=Denver Post |first=Carlos |last=Illescas |title=Centennial goes home rule |date=June 11, 2008}}</ref>

[[Centennial Airport]], formerly Arapahoe County Airport, lies adjacent to Centennial, but is located in unincorporated Arapahoe County. The airport is not named after the city, as it predates the city by over 30 years.

==Geography==
Centennial is roughly divided in half by [[Interstate 25 in Colorado|Interstate 25]], with most of its business and entertainment centers lying west of the highway. The city's boundaries are highly irregular and evocative of a [[Gerrymandering|gerrymander]], particularly the overwhelmingly residential eastern portions of the city, which appear with [[Foxfield, Colorado|Foxfield]], portions of Aurora, and unincorporated areas as a distorted [[checkerboard]] on the city's map.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Centennial Map|url=https://open-centennial.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/0c267059bb4644ccb94b48b8c4f0e3b5|access-date=December 4, 2020|website=open-centennial.opendata.arcgis.com|language=en-us}}</ref>

Centennial has many hills, gullies and ravines, and its open spaces are usually accompanied by recreational trails and parks, including Dry Creek Dam, DeKoevend Park, the [[High Line Canal|High line Canal Trail]], Willow Creek Trail, as well as Big Dry Creek and Little Dry Creek Trails. Centennial hosts most native wildlife and is a good reflection of Colorado's front range ecosystem. Centennial has seen a boost in coyote populations in recent years, leading to resident education on how to deter coyotes from eating family pets.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.centennialcolorado.com/forms.aspx?FID=60|title=CentennialColorado.com redirects to CentennialCo.gov|website=Centennialcolorado.com|access-date=August 27, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213071630/http://centennialcolorado.com/forms.aspx?FID=60|archive-date=December 13, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Centennial is located at 39°35'47" North, 104°50'38" West (39.5963, −104.8439).<ref name="GR1">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|access-date=April 23, 2011|date=February 12, 2011|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref>
