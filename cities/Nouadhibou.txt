'''Nouadhibou''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|w|æ|d|iː|b|uː|,_|ˈ|n|w|ɑː|-}}; {{langx|ar|نواذيبو}}, {{IPA|mey|nwaðiːbu|lang|LL-Q56231 (mey)-Tidjani Saleh-نواذيبو.wav}};formerly in [[French language|French]]: '''''{{lang|fr|Port-Étienne}}''''') is the second largest city in [[Mauritania]] and serves as a major commercial center. The city has about 173,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nouadhibou (Industrial and Commercial Urban Commune, Mauritania) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/mauritania/admin/nouadhibou/08101__nouadhibou/ |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> It is situated on a 65-kilometre [[peninsula]] or headland called [[Ras Nouadhibou]], ''{{lang|fr|Cap Blanc}}'', or ''{{lang|es|Cabo Blanco}}'', of which the western side has the city of [[La Güera]]. Nouadhibou is consequently located merely a couple of kilometers from the border between Mauritania and [[Western Sahara]]. Its current mayor is Elghassem Ould Bellali, who was installed on 15 October 2018.<ref>[http://fr.ami.mr/Depeche-46716.html Installation du maire de la commune de Nouadhibou], Agence Mauritanienne d'Information, 15 October 2018</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=MyCeni - Résultats 2023 |url=https://res-myceni.org/#/ |access-date=2023-12-05 |website=res-myceni.org}}</ref>

Nouadhibou is a major hotspot for [[People smuggling|migrant smuggling]], serving as a key departure point for those attempting to reach Europe.<ref name=":0" />

== Overview ==

The city consists of four major areas: the city center, including the international [[Nouadhibou International Airport|airport]]; [[Numerowatt]] to the north; [[Cansado]], the main residential area, to the south; and a [[Commuter town|dormitory town]] for the workers of the harbor facilities which are located a few kilometers south of the city, near the tip of the Ras Nouadhibou peninsula, at [[Port Minéralier]]. 

[[File:Nouadhibou,PortArtisanal1.jpg|thumb|Boats in Nouadhibou's harbour]]
[[File:Ships graveyard, Nouadhibou, Mauritania-2.jpg|thumb|Ships graveyard, Nouadhibou]]

Attractions in Nouadhibou include the [[Table Remarquable]]{{clarify|date=April 2018}}, several markets, a [[Ship graveyard|ships' graveyard]] and [[Mediterranean monk seal]]s. 

The port of Nouadhibou is the final resting place of over 300 scuttled ships, forming the world’s largest ship graveyard. Unlike the arrival ''en masse'' of ships at [[Mallows Bay]], here the number of craft has built up over time, as corrupt officials accepted bribes from boat owners to allow them to dump their vessels in the area. 

Nouadhibou has long been an important transit point for international transport. In the beginning of the 20th century, it was a stopover for the [[Groupe Latécoère|Latécoère]] air-transport network for mail and passengers for western Africa and overseas colonies like [[Martinique]]. [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry|Antoine de Saint-Exupery]] spent much time there as a pilot and as writer. 

Near the harbor is the terminus of [[Mauritania Railway|Mauritania's only railway line]], which mainly brings [[iron ore]] from the mining areas near [[Fdérik]] and [[Zouérat]], which are located up to {{convert|704|km}} inland. 

Processing [[iron ore]] forms the largest industry in Nouadhibou, although the overall major economic activity is fishing.

==History==
The town was established as a small fishing port, controlled by the Portuguese, the Dutch and finally the French.<ref>[http://www.fr.gardenationale-mr.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=65:wilaya-de-dakhlet-nouadhibou&catid=42:culture&Itemid=58 Wilaya de Dakhlet Nouadhibou], Garde Nationale</ref>  

In 1907 by decree of the governor-general of [[French West Africa]] [[Ernest Roume]], it was renamed ''Port-Étienne'' after the former French Minister of the Colonies [[Eugène Étienne]].<ref>[[Jean Abel Gruvel]], ''Les pêcheries des côtes du Sénégal et des rivières du Sud'', A. Challamel, Paris, 1908, p. 13 {{ISBN|2-11-091134-4}}</ref> After Mauritania became independent in 1960, the town name changed to Nouadhibou.  

On 30 June 1973, at the time of the second-longest solar eclipse in the 20th century, an [[Aerobee|Aerobee rocket]] was launched at Nouadhibou for solar research.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/sites/nouhibou.htm|title=Nouadhibou|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303201158/http://www.astronautix.com/sites/nouhibou.htm|archive-date=3 March 2016|url-status=dead|website=www.astronautix.com|access-date=Mar 13, 2019}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

Since February 2006, Nouadhibou has emerged as a major departure point for African migrants aiming to reach the [[Canary Islands]]. This extremely dangerous route to reach the [[European Union]] gained popularity due to heightened emigration controls along Morocco's coast and near the Spanish enclaves of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]] in late 2005.{{Citation needed|date=August 2024}} As of 2024, the city remains a significant departure hub for irregular migrants to Europe, with over 80% of arrivals in the Canary Islands originating from Mauritania, many of whom are from [[Mali]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |title=Mauritania is a beacon of stability in the coup-prone Sahel |url=https://www.economist.com/middle-east-and-africa/2024/06/27/mauritania-is-a-beacon-of-stability-in-the-coup-prone-sahel |access-date=2024-08-10 |work=The Economist |issn=0013-0613}}</ref>

The city is reputedly also a center of trading of [[meteorite]]s found in the [[Sahara]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6549197.stm |title=Meteorite smugglers anger scientists |work=BBC |access-date=2007-06-23 | date=2007-04-16 | location=London}}</ref>

==Climate==
Nouadhibou features a [[hot desert climate]] (''BWh'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. The city sees virtually no rainfall during the course of the year averaging a paltry {{convert|18|mm}} annually. Despite the fact that it features a hot desert climate, the area does not quite see the extreme temperatures that other areas with this climate feature because of strong maritime influences, which also causes a [[seasonal lag]] in the warmer months. The average annual temperature in the city is {{convert|21.3|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}} and the average annual high temperature is {{convert|27.1|°C|°F|1|abbr=on}}.

==Transportation==

===Paved roads===
Nouadhibou is linked with the Coastal Motorway RN2 to the capital [[Nouakchott]] (a distance of {{cvt|450|km}}) and by highway to the [[Western Sahara]]n border in the north (a distance of {{cvt|70|km}}). 

===Railway===
Nouadhibou also is connected by railway to the iron mines in [[Zouérat]], 670 km to the east. The freight trains can be as long as 3 km, reputedly the longest in the world. The [[Mauritania Railway|railway]] also carries passengers and calls at [[Choum]]. 

===Aviation===
The city is served by the [[Nouadhibou Airport]]. 
==Economy==
Plans were drawn up at the beginning of 1963 to build a port called Port Wharf in the fishing harbour, which included the construction of industrial and trade buildings. This became operational in 1966. This wharf was designed to accommodate traffic of up to 50,000 tonnes. 

In 1977, the wharf was lengthened to provide 3 extra berths for ships of average tonnage raising its capacity to 320,000 tonnes.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}   

==Health==
The [[Nouadhibou Regional Hospital]] was opened in 2017 after a build time of five years and is the largest hospital in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cridem.org/C_Info.php?article=697209|title=Nouadhibou : inauguration par le chef de l'état d'un hôpital des spécialités médicales|website=www.cridem.org|access-date=Mar 13, 2019}}</ref> 

==Sports==
Two football clubs based in Nouadhibou participate in the [[Mauritanian Premier League]] as of the 2018–19 season: [[FC Nouadhibou]] and [[ASC Snim]].<ref>[https://www.rsssf.org/tablesm/maur2019.html Mauritania]. ''[[RSSSF]]''.</ref>
