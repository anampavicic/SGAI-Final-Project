Gifu Prefecture borders [[Toyama Prefecture]] to the north; [[Ishikawa Prefecture]] to the northwest, [[Fukui Prefecture]] and [[Shiga Prefecture]] to the west, [[Mie Prefecture]] to the southwest, [[Aichi Prefecture]] to the south, and [[Nagano Prefecture]] to the east.

[[Gifu]] is the capital and largest city of Gifu Prefecture, with other major cities including [[Ōgaki]], [[Kakamigahara]], and [[Tajimi]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Gifu" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 246|page=246}}</ref>{{rp|page=246}}

Gifu Prefecture is located in the center of Japan, one of only eight [[landlocked]] prefectures, and features the country's [[center of population]]. Gifu Prefecture has served as the historic [[Intersection (road)|crossroads]] of Japan with routes connecting the east to the west, including the [[Nakasendō]], one of the [[Edo Five Routes|Five Routes]] of the [[Edo period]]. Gifu Prefecture was a long-term residence of [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Saitō Dōsan]], two influential figures of Japanese history in the [[Sengoku period]], spawning the popular phrase "control Gifu and you control Japan" in the late [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan|Medieval era]].<ref name="instant">''Instant Gifu''. Gifu International Center, 1995.</ref> Gifu Prefecture is known for its traditional ''[[Washi]]'' paper industry, including [[Gifu lanterns]] and [[Gifu umbrellas]], and as a center for the [[Japanese swordsmithing]] and [[Japanese kitchen knife|cutlery]] industries. Gifu Prefecture is home to [[Gifu Castle]], the 1,300-year-old tradition of [[cormorant fishing on the Nagara River]], and the site of the [[Battle of Sekigahara]].

== History ==
{{See also|List of Historic Sites of Japan (Gifu)}}

The land area that makes up modern-day Gifu became part of the [[Yamato period|Yamato Court]] around the middle of the fourth century. Because it is in the middle of the island of [[Honshu]], it has been the site of many decisive battles throughout Japan's history, the oldest major one being the [[Jinshin War]] in 672, which led to the establishment of [[Emperor Tenmu]] as the 40th emperor of Japan.

The area of Gifu Prefecture consists of the [[Old provinces of Japan|old provinces]] of [[Hida Province|Hida]] and [[Mino Province|Mino]], as well as smaller parts of [[Echizen Province|Echizen]] and [[Shinano Province|Shinano]].<ref>Nussbaum, "Provinces and prefectures" in {{Google books|p2QnPijAEmEC|p. 780|page=780}}</ref> The name of the prefecture derives from its capital city, [[Gifu]], which was named by [[Oda Nobunaga]] during [[Siege of Inabayama Castle|his campaign]] to unify all of Japan in 1567.<ref name="kashimoristone">Stone ledger in front of [[Kashimori Shrine]]. Erected by Kashimori Shrine.</ref> The first character used comes from Qishan ('''岐'''山), a legendary mountain from which most of China was unified, whereas the second character comes from [[Qufu]] (曲'''阜'''), the birthplace of [[Confucius]].<ref name="gkankou">[http://www.kankou-gifu.jp/en/outline/index.html Gifu tour guide – Outline of Gifu Prefecture] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001133648/http://www.kankou-gifu.jp/en/outline/index.html |date=October 1, 2011 }}. Gifu Prefecture Tourist Federation. Accessed September 9, 2007.</ref> Nobunaga chose those characters because he wanted to unify all of Japan and he wanted to be viewed as a great mind.

Historically, the prefecture served as the center of swordmaking for the whole of Japan, with [[Seki, Gifu|Seki]] being known for making the best swords in Japan. More recently, its strengths have been in fashion (primarily in the city of Gifu) and aerospace engineering ([[Kakamigahara]]).

On October 28, 1891, the present-day city of [[Motosu, Gifu|Motosu]] was the [[epicenter]] for the [[1891 Mino–Owari earthquake|Mino–Owari earthquake]], the second largest earthquake to ever hit Japan.<ref name="nsm">[http://research.kahaku.go.jp/rikou/namazu/04nobi/noubi.html Mino Earthquake] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706095621/http://research.kahaku.go.jp/rikou/namazu/04nobi/noubi.html |date=July 6, 2014 }}. {{in lang|ja}} Tokyo Science Museum. Accessed July 5, 2007.</ref> The earthquake, estimated at 8.0 ([[surface-wave magnitude]]), left a [[fault scarp]] that can still be seen today.

== Geography ==
One of the few landlocked prefectures in Japan, Gifu shares borders with seven other prefectures: [[Toyama Prefecture|Toyama]], [[Ishikawa Prefecture|Ishikawa]], [[Fukui Prefecture|Fukui]], [[Shiga Prefecture|Shiga]], [[Mie Prefecture|Mie]], [[Aichi Prefecture|Aichi]], and [[Nagano Prefecture|Nagano]]. Japan's [[postal code#Japan|postal codes]] all start with a three-digit number, ranging from 001 to 999. Part of Gifu has the 500 prefix, reflecting its location in the center of Japan.
The [[Center of population|center of Japanese population]] is currently located in Seki City, Gifu Prefecture. The center of population is a hypothetical point at which a country is perfectly balanced assuming each person has a uniform weight. The spot was calculated using the 2005 census.

{{as of|2019|03|31|post=,}} 18 percent of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as [[Prefectural Natural Park|Natural Parks]], namely the [[Hakusan National Park|Hakusan]] and [[Chūbu-Sangaku National Park|Chūbu-Sangaku]] National Parks, [[Hida-Kisogawa Quasi-National Park|Hida-Kisogawa]] and [[Ibi-Sekigahara-Yōrō Quasi-National Park|Ibi-Sekigahara-Yōrō]] Quasi-National Parks, and fifteen Prefectural Natural Parks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.env.go.jp/park/doc/data/natural/naturalpark_4.pdf |script-title=ja:自然公園都道府県別面積総括 |trans-title=General overview of area figures for Natural Parks by prefecture |language=ja |publisher=[[Ministry of the Environment (Japan)|Ministry of the Environment]] |date=31 March 2019 |access-date=22 July 2019}}</ref>

===Regions===
Gifu has five unofficial regions, which allows local municipalities to work together to promote the surrounding area. The five regions are [[Seinō]],<ref name="nishimino">[http://www.ginet.or.jp/nisimino/index.shtml Nishi Mino Portal Site]. {{in lang|ja}} Ginet.

Accessed August 9, 2011.</ref> The borders of the regions are loosely defined, but they are usually delineated among major cities.

===Topography===
The northern [[Hida (region)|Hida region]] is dominated by tall mountains, including parts of the [[Japanese Alps]]. The southern [[Mino Province|Mino]] region is mostly parts of the fertile [[Nōbi Plain]], a vast plains area with arable soil. Most of the prefecture's population lives in the southern part of the prefecture, near the [[Cities designated by government ordinance of Japan|designated city]] of [[Nagoya, Aichi|Nagoya]].

The mountainous Hida region contains the [[Hida Mountains]], which are referred to as the "Northern Alps" in Japan. The [[Ryōhaku Mountains]] are also in the Hida region. Other major ranges include the [[Ibuki Mountains]] and the [[Yōrō Mountains]].

Much of the Mino region is made up of the [[alluvial plain]] of the [[Kiso Three Rivers]], which are the [[Kiso River]], [[Nagara River]] and [[Ibi River]]. The sources of Kiso river is in Nagano prefecture, and those of the others are in Gifu prefecture. They eventually run through Aichi and Mie prefectures before emptying into [[Ise Bay]]. Other major rivers in the prefecture include the [[Jinzū River|Miya]], [[Takahara River|Takahara]], [[Shō River|Shō]], [[Shōnai River|Toki (Shōnai)]], [[Yahagi River|Yahagi]], and [[Itoshiro River|Itoshiro]] rivers.

=== Climate ===
[[File:MagomeVista.jpg|thumb|right|View from the top of a hill in [[Magome-juku]], Nakatsugawa, Gifu Prefecture]]
Gifu's climate varies from [[humid subtropical climate]] in the south, eventually making the transition to [[humid continental climate]] in the north.

Because the Mino region is surrounded by low mountains, the temperature fluctuates through the year, from hot summers to cold winters. The eastern city of [[Tajimi, Gifu|Tajimi]], for example, often records the hottest temperature in Japan each year and is considered to be the hottest city within Honshu boasting an average daytime high of {{convert|34.1|C}} during the peak of summer. On August 16, 2007, Tajimi set the record for the hottest day recorded in Japan's history—{{convert|40.9|C}}.<ref>[http://www.japannewsreview.com/society/national/20070816page_id=1553 Gifu Prefecture sees highest temperature ever recorded in Japan – 40.9]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160818051003/http://www.japannewsreview.com/society/national/20070816page_id%3D1553 |date=August 18, 2016 }} – [http://www.japannewsreview.com Japan News Review]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161019083232/http://www.japannewsreview.com/ |date=October 19, 2016 }}</ref> Summers are hotter, as the landlocked area becomes a heat island, and the temperature rises even further when hot, dry [[foehn wind]]s blow over the Ibuki Mountains from the [[Kansai region]]. The Hida region, with its higher elevation and northerly latitude, is significantly cooler than the Mino region, although there are sometimes extremely hot days there too. The Hida region is more famous for its harsh winters, bringing extremely heavy snowfall, especially in the northwestern areas. Gifu boasts a high amount of skiing locations. [[Shōkawa, Gifu|Shōkawa-chō]], part of the city of [[Takayama, Gifu|Takayama]], is up in the mountains, and its location has led it to be called the coldest inhabited place on Honshū.

== Economy ==
[[File:Mitarashi dango 001.jpg|thumb|''[[Dango|Mitarashi dango]]'', a traditional sweet dumpling from [[Hida, Gifu]]]]

Traditional industries such as paper-making and agriculture are found in Gifu, but its economy is dominated by the manufacturing sector including aerospace and automotive, with industrial complexes extending from the Nagoya area. A wealth of small component manufacturing is also found, such as precision machines, dye and mold making, and plastic forming.

===Traditional industries===
[[File:Ukai Gifu Nagaragawa 05.jpg|thumb|[[Cormorant fishing]] in Nagara River]]
Gifu is famous for [[Cormorant Fishing on the Nagara River|cormorant fishing]], which has a history of over 1,300 years. Agriculture is also a major industry because of Gifu's vast, arable plains. The forests in the north provide materials for woodworking and for the viewing boats used in cormorant fishing.

The Mino region has long been known for its high-quality paper called ''[[Mino washi]]'', which is stronger and thinner than most other papers in Japan, and was used by the Japanese military during World War II.<ref name="fireballoon">{{cite web |title=The Fire Balloons |url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/air/avfusen.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175214/http://www.faqs.org/docs/air/avfusen.html |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |author=Greg Goebel |access-date=November 23, 2007}}</ref> Other paper-based products include [[Gifu Lanterns]] and [[Gifu Umbrellas]], made in the prefectural capital of [[Gifu, Gifu|Gifu]]. Other traditional goods include ''mino-yaki'' pottery in [[Tajimi, Gifu|Tajimi]], [[Toki, Gifu|Toki]], and [[Mizunami, Gifu|Mizunami]], [[cutlery]] in [[Seki, Gifu|Seki]], and [[lacquerware]] in [[Takayama, Gifu|Takayama]]. [[Sake]] is often brewed with clear water from the rivers.

===Modern industries===
[[Kakamigahara, Gifu|Kakamigahara]] has a large role in the prefecture's modern industries. It boasts large aerospace facilities of both [[Kawasaki Heavy Industries]] and [[Mitsubishi Heavy Industries]], as well as many [[metalworking]] and [[manufacturing]] companies.

Information technology (IT) is gaining a foothold in the prefecture with both [[Softopia Japan]] in [[Ōgaki, Gifu|Ōgaki]] and VR Techno Japan (part of Techno Plaza) in Kakamigahara. The capital city of Gifu, located between Ōgaki and Kakamigahara, is also working to strengthen its IT fields, too.

===Tourism===
[[File:Ogi Shirakawa01n3200.jpg|thumb|Traditional housing in Shirakawa-gō]]

Gifu has many popular tourist attractions, bringing visitors to all parts of the prefecture. The most popular places are Gifu, [[Gero, Gifu|Gero]], [[Shirakawa, Gifu (village)|Shirakawa]] and [[Takayama, Gifu|Takayama]]. Gero is known for its relaxing [[hot spring]]s, which attract visitors throughout the year. Shirakawa's [[Historic Villages of Shirakawa-gō and Gokayama|historic villages]] are a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]. Takayama is famous for retaining its original appearance and is often referred to as ''Little [[Kyoto]]''.

In addition to international tourists, Gifu also plays host to many international events. The [[World Event and Convention Complex Gifu]] is available for many types of events. Other areas of Gifu, too, bring international events. The [[World Rowing Championships]] were held in the city of [[Kaizu, Gifu|Kaizu]] in 2005. The [[FIS Snowboard World Cup]] was held in the city of [[Gujo, Gifu|Gujo]] in 2008. The [[APEC]] Japan 2010 SME Ministerial Meetings were held in [[Gifu City]].

===Science===
The Kamioka area of the city of [[Hida, Gifu|Hida]] is home to the [[Kamioka Observatory]] underground laboratory. Located {{Convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} underground in Kamioka Mining and Smelting Co.'s Mozumi Mine, the [[Super-Kamiokande]] experiment searches for neutrinos from the high atmosphere, the sun and supernovae, while the [[KamLAND]] experiment searches for antineutrinos from regional nuclear reactors. The Super-Kamiokande consists of a cylindrical stainless steel tank that is {{Convert|41.4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall and {{Convert|39.3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in diameter holding 50,000 tons of ultra-pure water. Some of the 11,146 photomultiplier tubes are on display at the [[Miraikan]] in Tokyo. The same facility also hosts the [[CLIO]] prototype and [[KAGRA]] gravitational wave detector.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Gifu prefecture population pyramid in 2020.svg|thumb|Gifu prefecture population pyramid in 2020]]
The prefecture's population was 2,101,969, {{as of|2007|09|01|lc=y| post=,}} with approximately 1.8&nbsp;million people in the cities and the rest in towns and villages.<ref name="stat">[http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/pref/s11111/data/data.htm Statistics Division of Gifu Prefecture] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014004923/http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/pref/s11111/data/data.htm |date=October 14, 2007 }}. {{in lang|ja}} Gifu Prefecture. Accessed November 2, 2007.</ref> The percentage of male and female residents is 48.4% and 51.6%, respectively.<ref name="stat"/> 14.4% of the population is no more than 14 years old, with 22.1% of the population being at least 65 years old.<ref name="stat"/>

According to Japan's [[census#Japan|census]], the country's [[center of population]] is located in Gifu Prefecture. In 2000, it was located in the former town of Mugi, which has since merged with [[Seki, Gifu|Seki]]. In the most recent census in 2005, the center of population has moved slightly more to the east but is still located within Gifu.

== Prefectural symbols ==
[[File:Gifu prefectural logo.JPG|thumb|upright=.5|Prefectural Logo]]

Gifu's symbol comes from the first character ''gi'' (岐) of its Japanese name, written in a stylized script, surrounded by a circle, which represents the peace and harmony of the prefectural citizen. It was chosen by contest in 1932.<ref name="symguide">[http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/pref/s11111/english/eng2007-1.pdf A Statistical Guide to Gifu Prefecture 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325083413/http://www.pref.gifu.lg.jp/pref/s11111/english/eng2007-1.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}. Gifu Prefecture. Accessed November 2, 2007.</ref>

The prefectural logo (''see right'') expands from the red dot into the center to the outer two lines and, finally, the yellow plain. This symbol was chosen in 1991 for the development and expansion of the prefecture.<ref name="symguide"/>

The prefecture also has two plants (the [[milk vetch]] (renge) and the [[Taxus cuspidata|Japanese yew]]) and two animals (the [[rock ptarmigan|snow grouse]] and the [[Ayu sweetfish|ayu]]) as symbols. The milk vetch was chosen in 1954, because the prefecture is well known for its abundance of blooming milk vetch each spring. The yew was chosen in 1966, because it is the tree used to make ornamental scepters for the emperor, many of which came from the Hida district. The snow grouse was chosen in 1961, as the birds live up in the Japanese alps and is a nationally protected species. Ayu were chosen in 1989, because the fish is found in many prefectural rivers and is prized for its sweet taste.<ref name="symguide"/>
