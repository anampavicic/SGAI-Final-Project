==Etymology==
Some link the name of the city to the Greek word Θέρμος (''thermos''), meaning "hot", and date the [[toponym]] to the rule of [[Alexander the Great]].<ref>E. M. Pospelov, ''Geograficheskie nazvaniya mira'' (Moscow, 1998), p. 415</ref> Others suggest that it came from [[Sanskrit]] तर्मतो (''tarmato''), meaning "on the river bank".<ref>Sh.

== History ==

===Ancient times===

[[File:Fayaz Tepe, Seated Buddha.jpg|left|thumb|Buddha with monks, from [[Fayaz Tepe]].]]One of Central Asia's oldest towns, Old Termez, located a few kilometers west of the modern city along the [[Amu Darya]] river, was established sometime before the 3rd century BC.<ref>Rtveladze, E. V. (1994). Kampir-tepe: Structures, written documents, and coins. Bulletin of the Asia Institute, 8, 141–154.</ref> The city may have been known to the [[Achaemenids]] (the 10th century [[Shahnameh]] purports its existence during the [[mythological]] [[Zoroastrian]] [[Kayanian dynasty]]).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ferdowsi |first1=Abolqasem |title=Shahnameh: The Persian Book of Kings |date=2016 |publisher=Penguin Classics |isbn=9780143108320}}</ref>

In 329 BC [[Alexander the Great]] conquered the surrounding region, known as [[Sogdia]]. Most recent scholarship argues that Termez is the site of Alexandria on the Oxus,<ref>[[Edvard Rtveladze]]. Кампыртепа – Александрия Оксианская: город-крепость на берегу Окса в эллинистическое и постэллинистическое время (конец IV в. до н.э.- I в. до н.э.)

Ахеологические исследования Кампыртепа [Materials of the Tocharistan expedition X. Archeological research of Kampyrtepa], Tashkent : San’at, 2017, 148 p.</ref> though some identify this site with [[Ai-Khanoum]]. After a period of [[Seleucid]] rule, Termez became part of the breakaway [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom]]. The [[Ionian Greek]] language persisted in the area through the [[Tokharistan|Tocharian]] period, being phased out of administrative use during the time of the [[Kushan Empire]], in favor of the [[Bactrian language]].<ref>Falk, Harry (2001). "The yuga of Sphujiddhvaja and the era of the Kuṣāṇas". Silk Road Art and Archaeology VII. pp. 121–136.</ref>

It was during this period that Termez, named Ta-li-mi (迭里迷) in Chinese sources, became an important center of [[Mahāsāṃghika]] [[Buddhism]].<ref>Esparraguera, J. M. G., Gil, E. A., Ferreras, V. M., & Pidaev, S. R. (2015). The Buddhist occupation of Tchingiz Tepe (Termez, Uzbekistan) in the Kushan period through the ceramic contexts.

</ref> Termez was incorporated into the [[Sasanian Empire|Sassanid Persian Empire]] in the 3rd century AD, and elements of Zoroastrian-Buddhist [[religious syncretism]] appear in the archaeological record, with Buddhist [[Monastery|monasteries]] containing [[fire temple|fire altars]],<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Staviskii |first1=B |last2=Mkrtychev |first2=T |title=Qara-Tepe in Old Termez: On the History of the Monument |journal=Bulletin of the Asia Institute |date=1996 |volume=10 |page=224 |jstor=24048898 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/24048898 |access-date=5 October 2021}}</ref> and a [[graffiti]] inscription referencing "Buddha-[[Ahura Mazda|Mazda]]."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Stavisky |first1=Boris |title="Buddha-Mazda" from Kara-tepe in Old Termez (Uzbekistan): A Preliminary Communication |journal=The Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies |date=1980 |volume=3 |issue=2 |page=89 |url=https://journals.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/index.php/jiabs/article/viewFile/8524/2431 |access-date=5 October 2021}}</ref>

During the 7th century Termez played host to the [[Buddhist monk]] and traveler [[Xuanzang]], who reported:

}}

In the three decades that followed, as the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] conquered the [[Persians]], Termez found itself across the river from the [[caliphate]].

===Islamic Golden Age===
 [[File:Jalal al-Din Rumi, Showing His Love for His Young Disciple Hussam al-Din Chelebi.jpg|right|thumb|Termez is the setting of some of the stories in [[Rumi]]'s [[Masnavi]].]]
In 676 the city was [[Muslim conquest of Transoxiana|conquered by the Umayyad Caliphate]].<ref>{{cite book | title = The Arab Conquests in Central Asia | first = H. A.

It again rose to religious significance during the [[Abbasid]] and [[Samanid]] Empires, producing notable scholars such as the renowned [[hadith]] scholar [[al-Tirmidhi]] and [[Sufi]] master and theologian [[al-Hakim al-Tirmidhi]].

Termez passed through the hands of the [[Ghaznavid]], [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]], [[Karakhanid]], and [[Khorezmshah]] kingdoms from the 11th to 13th centuries.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ub.edu/ERAAUB/index.php/research-lines/asia/archaeological-research-in-ancient-termez-uzbekistan |title=Archaeological research in ancient Termez (Uzbekistan): Greek colony, a centre of Central Asian Buddhism and Islamic city in Bactriana (Central Asia) |author=<!--Not stated--> |website=The Archaeological and Archaeometric Research Group of the University of Barcelona |publisher=Universitat de Barcelona |access-date=2021-10-01 |quote=After the fall of the Samanids, between the 11th and the early 13th century, ancient Termez was contested between several Central Asian dynasties (i.e, Kharakanids, Ghaznavids, Seljuqs, Kara Khitays, Ghurids and the Khwarazm Shas), who alternatively controlled this powerful stronghold.}}</ref>

In 1220 after a two-day siege, the city was destroyed by the troops of [[Genghis Khan]]. According to one account, "all the people, both men and women, were driven out onto the plain, and divided in accordance with their [the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]'] usual custom, then they were all slain."<ref>{{cite web|url= https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |title= Central Asian world cities |publisher= Faculty.washington.edu |date= 29 September 2007 |access-date= 14 April 2012 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120118121401/https://faculty.washington.edu/modelski/CAWC.htm |archive-date= 18 January 2012 }}</ref><ref>''See also'' [https://archive.org/details/Boyle1968IlKhansCHIran05/page/n9/mode/1up?view=theater ''Cambridge History of Iran'', Vol. V, Ch. 4, "Dynastic and Political History of the Il-Khans" (John Andrew Boyle), p.312 (1968) ("the whole population, men and women, were driven out on to the plain, and divided amongst the soldiers, by whom they were then put to death, each soldier being responsible for the execution of a fixed number of persons").]</ref>

[[Ibn Battuta]] found the city reconstructed in the early 14th century:

{{Blockquote
|text=We set out from [[Samarqand]] and reached Tirmidh [Termez], a large town with fine buildings and [[bazaars]] and traversed by [[canals]]. It abounds in grapes and quinces of an exquisite flavour, as well as in flesh-meats and milk. The inhabitants wash their heads in the bath with milk instead of [[fuller's earth]]; the proprietor of every [[bath-house]] has large jars filled with milk, and each man as he enters takes a cupful to wash his head. It makes the hair fresh and glossy . . . The old town of Tirmidh was built on the bank of the Oxus, and when it was laid in ruins by [[Genghis Khan|Tinklz]] [Chingiz] this new town was built two miles from the river.
|source=''Ibn Battuta Travels in Asia And Africa 1325–1354''
}}

The restored Termez soon came under the rule of [[Tamerlane]]'s [[Timurid Empire]] with the backing of the Tirmidh [[Sayyids]], a local religious aristocracy claiming descent from [[Muhammad]] through [[Sayyid Ali Akbar]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Barthold |first=V |date=1956 |title=Four Studies on the History of Central Asia|publisher=E, J. Brill |pages=19–20}}</ref> The Timurids held the territory until it became a part of the independent [[Emirate of Bukhara]] in the 16th century.

By the second half of the 18th century the city was again abandoned, and the [[ruins]] of the reconstituted Termez laid outside the nearby villages of Salavat and Pattakesar (Pattagissar).

===In the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union===
[[File:RIAN archive 58833 Withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan (cropped).jpg|thumb|The last column of soviet [[BTR (vehicle)|BTRs]] leaves [[Afghanistan]] in 1989.]]
In 1887, the [[Russian Empire]] began to operate a [[brown water navy]] on the Amu Darya River.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ochildiev |first1=F |title=The Creation of the Amudarya Fleet |journal=Theoretical and Applied Science |date=2019 |volume=78 |issue=10 |page=583 |doi=10.15863/TAS.2019.10.78.105 |s2cid=213586953 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/337210060 |access-date=3 October 2021|doi-access=free }}</ref>

In December 1894, the Amu Darya Fleet was joined by the 31st Amu Darya Border Brigade. In the coming years troop levels were increased, as the 4th [[Orenburg Cossacks|Orenburg Cossack]] Regiment, the 13th [[Russian Turkestan|Turkestan]] Special Battalion, and the 2nd Orenburg Cossack Battery were relocated to the area.<ref name="Turopova">{{cite journal |last1=Turopova |first1=Turdievna |title=Migration Processes in Cities Under the Emirates of Bukhara |journal=JournalNX |date=2020 |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=510–512 |url=https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/336772-migration-processes-in-cities-under-the-48a86fe0.pdf |access-date=3 October 2021}}</ref>

The [[Emirate of Bukhara]] acquiesced to increasing demands from the [[Tsarist]] government for more lands, until on January 27, 1900, over nine thousand acres were donated to Russia, and the Russian military began a program of [[Russian people|Russian]] resettlement to the area.<ref name="Turopova" />

In the immediate aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution]], Pattakesar became a part of the [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic]], and then the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1928, as part of the [[Soviet Union]], Pattakesar was renamed and took the city's ancient name of Termez. In 1929, the village became a town.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asson-hotel.com/eng/about-termiz.php |website=Asson Hotel |title=About Termiz City |access-date=4 October 2021}}</ref>

During the years of Soviet rule, as Termez became a hub of Russian military activity, many industries were developed, and a pedagogical institute and a [[Theater (structure)|theatre]] were opened. Termez saw a significant increase in industrial development during [[World War II]], as the Soviet Union replaced industrial centers in the western regions that had been disrupted by [[Nazi]] attacks.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Boronov |first1=Abdulhakim |title=Development and Progression of National Crafts in Uzbekistan |journal=Theoretical and Applied Science |date=2020 |volume=87 |issue=7 |page=48 |doi=10.15863/TAS.2020.07.87.12 |s2cid=225517551 |url=http://www.t-science.org/arxivDOI/2020/07-87/PDF/07-87-12.pdf}}</ref>

For many years after the [[Second World War]] the [[108th Motor Rifle Division]], the former 360th Rifle Division, was based in the town. During the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] (1979–1989), Termez became an increasingly important military post, with over 100,000 [[Soviet Military|Soviet troops]] stationed there.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Neef |first1=Christian |title=Absolutism in Uzbekistan: Germany's Favorite Despot |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/absolutism-in-uzbekistan-germany-s-favorite-despot-a-429712.html |access-date=4 October 2021 |agency=Der Spiegel |date=August 2, 2006}}</ref> A military airfield and the [[Afghanistan–Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge]], a [[road-rail bridge|combined bridge]] over the [[Amu Darya]], were built. In 1989, [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|Soviet forces withdrew from Afghanistan]] via the Termez bridge, bringing the conflict to an end.

===21st century Afghan conflicts and aftermath===

In 2001, [[Germany]] began operating a base in Termez. The [[airbase|military airfield]] was the main support base for [[Bundeswehr|German]] and [[Military of the Netherlands|Dutch]] forces operating with the [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]] for transiting goods into Afghanistan. It was closed in 2015.<ref>{{cite news |title=Western Militaries Exit Central Asia As Germany Shuts Uzbek Base |url=https://www.rferl.org/a/uzbekistan-germany-to-shut-base-last-western-in-central-asia/27308248.html |newspaper=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty |date=15 October 2015 |access-date=5 October 2021}}</ref>

Following the [[2021 Taliban offensive]] and resultant [[Fall of Kabul (2021)|Fall of Kabul]], the [[Biden]] administration reached out to Uzbekistan, as well as Kazakhstan and [[Tajikistan]], to ask if they might temporarily accommodate up to 9,000 Afghans who might face reprisals for working with U.S. military forces.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-02/u-s-asks-central-asian-nations-to-take-afghans-seeking-visas|access-date=5 July 2021|newspaper=Bloomberg.com|title=U.S. Seeks Refuge for Afghan Staff as It Hands Over Key Base|date=2 July 2021 }}</ref> By the 5th of July, the state security services had constructed a [[refugee camp]] in Termez to brace for an Afghan [[refugee crisis]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Uzbekistan bracing for possible Afghan refugee crisis {{!}} Eurasianet|url=https://eurasianet.org/uzbekistan-bracing-for-possible-afghan-refugee-crisis|access-date=5 July 2021|website=eurasianet.org|language=en}}</ref> Uzbek president [[Shavkat Mirziyoyev]] reported that 494 Afghans were evacuated through the Termez Airport.<ref>{{cite web |title=US says nearly 500 Afghan citizens evacuated from Uzbekistan |url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/central-asia/news/us-says-nearly-500-afghan-citizens-evacuated-from-uzbekistan/ |website=Euractiv |date=15 September 2021 |access-date=5 October 2021}}</ref>

==Transportation==

The river [[Amu Darya]] divides the two countries of Uzbekistan and [[Afghanistan]] and the [[Afghanistan–Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge]] crosses the river to [[Hairatan]] in Afghanistan.  Termez is also served by [[Termez Airport]], with flights to [[Tashkent]] and [[Moscow]]. Termez is connected with [[Uzbek Railways]] to other cities of the country and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]], Afghanistan. The Tashkent–Termez (no. 379) and Termez–Tashkent (no. 380) trains run every day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/uzbekistan_railways.htm|title = Uzbekistan Railways}}</ref> [[Dushanbe]]–[[Kanibadam]] (no. 367) and Kanibadam-Dushanbe (No: 368) trains also pass through Termez.

Plans exist to connect Termez to [[Peshawar]] by rail, as a part of the [[China–Pakistan Economic Corridor]], and [[China]]'s larger [[Belt and Road Initiative]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Pakistan promotes Belt and Road port for Central Asian trade |url=https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Belt-and-Road/Pakistan-promotes-Belt-and-Road-port-for-Central-Asian-trade |website=Nikkei Asia |access-date=5 October 2021}}</ref>

There is public transportation in the city, represented by [[bus]]es and [[marshrutka]]s. There are also public and private [[taxi]] services. Termez river port (Termiz daryo bandargohi) is located in the south-eastern part of the city.

The city has an [[international airport]] "[[Termez Airport|Termez]]", which has regular air connections with [[Tashkent]], with some other major cities of Uzbekistan, as well as with some Russian cities, including [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]].

Termez is the main southern gateway of Uzbekistan. 12&nbsp;km east of Termez, the [[Amu Darya|Amu Darya River]] is crossed by the [[pedestrian]], [[highway]] and railroad cross-border [[bridge]] Hairatan (also known as the [[Afghanistan–Uzbekistan Friendship Bridge]]), which is the only border crossing between Uzbekistan and [[Afghanistan]]. Every day, people, [[car]]s, [[truck]]s and [[freight train]]s pass over the bridge in both directions.

The city is one of the main [[Rail transport|railroad]] hubs of southern Uzbekistan. It is from Termez that the international freight railroad leading to the Afghan city of [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] begins.

In fact, the railroad goes all the way to [[Mazar-i-Sharif International Airport]], 8&nbsp;km east of that city. The distance between Termez and [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] is about 80&nbsp;km by [[road]] or [[Rail transport|rail]].  As of 2024, the Afghan part of this line is not open for passengers.<ref>https://thediplomat.com/2023/02/after-temporary-suspension-whats-next-for-the-trans-afghan-railway/</ref> <ref>https://eticket.railway.uz/en/home?f=undefined&t=undefined&date=</ref>.

== Demographics ==
[[File:Termez, stallholders.JPG|thumb|Stall-holders in a Termez [[bazaar]]]]
The estimated population of Termez in 2021 was 182,800.<ref name="surxonstat" /> [[Uzbeks]] and [[Tajiks]] are the largest ethnic groups.

===Historical and archaeological sites===

* [[Archaeological Museum of Termez|Termez Archaeological Museum]] opened in 2002 to commemorate the 2,500th anniversary of Termez.<ref name="uzbek-travel.com">{{Cite web|title=Archeology Museum, Termez, Uzbekistan|url=http://uzbek-travel.com/about-uzbekistan/monuments/archeology-museum/|access-date=1 November 2020|website=uzbek-travel.com}}</ref> It exhibits archaeological finds and other historic artefacts from sites across [[Surxondaryo Region]]. The modern building has a turquoise domed roof and an attractively tiled facade. It is one of the largest and best museums in Uzbekistan.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Ibbotson|first=Sophie|title=Uzbekistan|publisher=Bradt Guides Ltd|year=2020|isbn=9-781784-771089|location=United Kingdom|pages=202–205}}</ref> There are around 27,000 items in the collection.<ref name="uzbek-travel.com"/>

:Much of the museum's collection focuses on Termez's [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] history, in particular the [[Greco-Bactrian Kingdom|Graeco-Bactrian]] and [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] eras. There are scale models of archeological sites including [[Kampir Tepe]], [[Fayaz Tepe]], and [[Khalchayan]]; and magnificent wall paintings and sculptures, as well as coins, ceramics, and even ancient chess sets.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Archaeological Museum of Termez|url=https://caravanistan.com/uzbekistan/south/termez/archaeological-museum/|access-date=1 November 2020|website=Caravanistan|language=en-US}}</ref>

* Kyr Kyz (The 40 Girls Fortress) takes its name from a Central Asian [[legend]] about a princess and her 40 companions who defended their land against invaders.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Qyrq Qyz (Forty Girls) {{!}} Aga Khan Development Network|url=https://www.akdn.org/akmp/performance/qyrq-qyz-forty-girls|access-date=1 November 2020|website=www.akdn.org}}</ref> Although this monument is called a fortress, archeologists believe it was actually either a [[caravanserai]] or a summer palace.<ref name=":0" /> It was built during the 9th century in the [[Samanid Empire|Samanid]] period. Although it is now in ruins, it is still possible to see the 54m long mud brick walls, which in places are two storeys high. One section has been restored so you are able to compare the old and the new.<ref name=":0" />
* The [[Muhammad ibn `Ali at-Tirmidhi|Al Hakim At-Termizi]] architectural complex dates from the 10th to 15th centuries. It is centred on the mud brick mausoleum of Al Hakim At-Termizi, a [[Sufism|Sufi]] saint, jurist, and writer who died in Termez in 859. The site was expanded and improved at the instigation of Timur's son, [[Shah Rukh]], in the 15th century.<ref name=":0" />
* The [[Sultan Saodat]] architectural ensemble developed in stages between the 10th and 17th centuries. It was the family necropolis of the Termez [[Sayyid]]s, a politically and religiously influential local dynasty which claimed descent from [[Ali]]. There are approximately 120 graves in the complex, as well as a number of religious buildings. The mortar holding the mud bricks together is an unusual&nbsp; mixture of clay, egg yolk, camels’ blood, and milk. There are pre-Islamic decorative symbols on some of the buildings, including a [[Zoroastrianism|Zorastrian]] star motif which represents infinity and fertility.
* The Kokil Dara Khanagha was built by [[Abdullah Khan II]] of [[Bukhara]] in the 16th century. The building was created as a resting place for itinerant [[Sufism|Sufi]] [[dervish]]es and other holy men. It has cultural links with various buildings in Afghanistan, including the styling of the vaulted ceiling. There is no central courtyard as this order of Sufis didn't whirl, but instead focused on quiet, solitary [[meditation]].<ref name=":0" />
* [[Kara Tepe]] is a rock cut Buddhist temple complex founded in the 2nd century AD on the hills outside Termez. It is right on the Uzbek–Afghan border, and so a permit is required to visit.<ref name=":0" /> The site includes cave cells (which were used as burial sites once the temple was abandoned in the 4th century), a series of brick buildings, and small [[stupa]]s. It is similar in design to other Buddhist temples built in [[Gandhara]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43545117|title=History of civilizations of Central Asia|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|others=Dani, Ahmad Hasan., Masson, V.

The main stupa (which is now encased in a protective dome) could be much older.<ref name=":0" /> Fayaz Tepe was a regionally important site, attracting Buddhist scholars from along the [[Silk Road]], as is evidenced by pottery finds inscribed with [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]], [[Punjabis|Punjabi]], [[Kharosthi]], and [[Bactrian camel|Bactrian]] scripts.<ref name=":0" /> The Buddhist [[fresco]]es excavated here are now on display in the [[State Museum of History of Uzbekistan]]&nbsp; in [[Tashkent]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Lukonin, Vladimir Grigorʹevich.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/859157465|title=Central Asian art|date=2013|publisher=Parkstone Press International|others=Ivanov, Anatoly.|isbn=978-1-78042-894-9|location=New York|oclc=859157465}}</ref>
* The [[Zurmala Stupa]] is one of the oldest surviving buildings in Uzbekistan, dating from the 1st to 2nd centuries AD. Its brick structure is 16m high and is the only remaining part of a vast Buddhist [[stupa]] which would have been originally clad in stone and richly decorated.<ref name=":0" />
*[[Kampir Tepe]] was a substantial city built on the [[Amu Darya]] river by Alexander the Great. Known as Alexandria on the Oxus, the city had an important harbour with a lighthouse, as well as a citadel, temples, and a gateway that is a replica of one found in [[Pamphylia]] in Turkey. The site is still being excavated by archeologists but is open to the public.
