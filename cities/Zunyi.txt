'''Zunyi''' ({{zh|s=遵义 |t=遵義 |p=Zūnyì}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in northern [[Guizhou]] province, People's Republic of China, situated between the provincial capital [[Guiyang]] to the south and [[Chongqing]] to the north, also bordering [[Sichuan]] to the northwest. Along with Guiyang and [[Liupanshui]], it is one of the most important cities of the province. The metro area is made of three urban districts of the city, Huichuan, Honghuagang, and Bozhou, had a population of 2,360,549 people; and the whole prefecture, including 14 county-level administration area as a whole, had a population of 6,606,675 at the 2020 census.

Zunyi is known for being the location  of the [[Zunyi Conference]] in 1935, where [[Mao Zedong]] was first elected to the leadership of the [[Chinese Communist Party]] during the [[Long March]].<ref name="zb"/>

== History ==
[[File:海龙屯 新王宫遗址.jpg|thumb|left|The [[World Heritage Site]] of [[Hailongtun]] fortress, the last rebel holdout during the [[Bozhou Rebellion]] in 1600.]]
The area of Zunyi was originally inhabited by the Tongzi people during the [[Paleolithic]]. Later, its territory was a part of several kingdoms. Zunyi was considered to be the center of the [[Yelang]] kingdom. The region around Zunyi first came under Chinese rule during [[Han dynasty]], during the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]]. After the Han dynasty collapsed, the area remained under nominal Chinese control, but much of the administration was left to local, non-Han chiefs. In the 7th century CE, the area came under regular Chinese administration during the [[Tang dynasty]], Zunyi was placed under the new Bo Prefecture (Bozhou).<ref name="pzz">{{cite book |last1=Schmidt |first1=Jerry D. |title=The Poet Zheng Zhen (1806-1864) and the Rise of Chinese Modernity |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WtMY9WdY3kYC&pg=PA45 |publisher=BRILL |access-date=24 February 2021 |language=en |date=20 June 2013|isbn=9789004252295 }}</ref>

Towards the end of the Tang, Bozhou was conquered by the [[Nanzhao]] Kingdom. However, it soon gained independence as the [[Chiefdom of Bozhou]] in AD 876. The chiefdom became an autonomous prefecture of the [[Song dynasty|Song]] and subsequent dynasties, while the ruling Yang family held power in Zunyi for more than seven centuries. [[Bozhou rebellion|Bozhou rebelled]] against the [[Ming dynasty]] in 1589, resisting the Ming for more than a decade before its eventual destruction in 1600. Subsequently, Zunyi Prefecture was established, with the present-day city of Zunyi becoming the prefectural seat.<ref name="ct">{{cite web |title=CHINA TODAY |url=http://www.chinatoday.com.cn/english/china/2013-09/25/content_569766.htm |website=www.chinatoday.com.cn |access-date=24 February 2021}}</ref> Zunyi retained its status as a prefectural seat through the [[Qing dynasty]]. After the [[Xinhai Revolution]], Zunyi was redesignated as a county in 1914.<ref name="zb">{{cite web |title=Zunyi {{!}} China |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Zunyi |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en}}</ref>

In 1935, the [[Zunyi Conference]] took place in the city, resulting in [[Mao Zedong]] becoming the ''de facto'' leader of the [[Chinese Communist Party]].<ref name="zb"/>

During the country's [[Five-year plans of China#First Plan (1953–1957)|First Five-Year Plan]], Zunyi was redesignated as a city, and experienced considerable growth and transformation.<ref name="zb"/>

==Geography and climate==
Zunyi is located in northern Guizhou at an elevation of {{convert|865|m|abbr=on}}; it is situated in the transition from the [[Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau]] to the [[Sichuan Basin]] and hill country of [[Hunan]].

Zunyi has a four-season, [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), slightly modified by elevation. It has fairly mild winters and hot, humid summers; close to 60% of the year's {{convert|1022|mm|0|abbr=on}} of precipitation occurs from May to August. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|4.7|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|25.4|°C|1}} in July, while the annual mean is {{convert|15.8|°C|1}}. Rain is common throughout the year, with 176 days annually precipitation, though it does not actually accumulate to much in winter, the cloudiest time of year; summer, in contrast, is the sunniest. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from around 9% in January and February to 42% in August, the city receives only 1,028 hours of bright sunshine annually; only a few locations in neighbouring [[Sichuan]] receive less sunshine on average.
