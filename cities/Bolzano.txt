With a population of 108,245, Bolzano is also by far the largest city in South Tyrol and the third largest in historical [[Tyrol]]. The greater metro area has about 250,000 inhabitants and is one of the urban centres within the [[Alps]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://astat.provincia.bz.it/it/news-pubblicazioni-info.asp?news_action=300&news_image_id=1151032 |title=Andamento demografico (dati provvisori) - 2022|publisher=Provincia autonoma di Bolzano|access-date=2023-07-23}}</ref>

Bolzano is the seat of the [[Free University of Bozen-Bolzano]], where lectures and seminars are held in English, German, and Italian. The city is also home to the [[Italian Army]]'s [[Alpini]] High Command ([[Comando Truppe Alpine|COMALP]]) and some of its combat and support units.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.truppealpine.eu/composizione/unita_supporto_base.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071225072425/http://www.truppealpine.eu/composizione/unita_supporto_base.htm|url-status=dead|title=Le unità di supporto del Comando Truppe Alpine|archivedate=25 December 2007|website=www.truppealpine.eu|language=it}}</ref> In the 2020 version of the annual ranking of quality of life in Italian cities, Bolzano was ranked joint first for quality of life alongside [[Bologna]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Qualità della vita 2020|url=https://lab24.ilsole24ore.com/qualita-della-vita/classifiche-complete.php|newspaper=Il Sole 24 Ore|access-date=30 March 2021|archive-date=18 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210418034421/https://lab24.ilsole24ore.com/qualita-della-vita/classifiche-complete.php|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Along with other Alpine towns in South Tyrol, Bolzano engages in the [[Alpine Town of the Year]] Association for the implementation of the Alpine Convention. The Convention aims to promote and achieve sustainable development in the Alpine Arc. Consequently, Bolzano was awarded the 2009 Alpine Town of the Year. Bolzano is considered a bridge between [[Northern Europe]] and [[Southern Europe]] due to the three spoken languages in [[South Tyrol]] ([[Italian language|Italian]], [[German language|German]], and [[Ladin language|Ladin]]) and the confluence of the [[Culture of Italy|Italian]] and [[Culture of Germany|German]]-[[Culture of Austria|Austrian]] cultures.

== Geography ==

[[File:Luftbild Bolzano.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Bolzano]]
[[File:Bolzano alps.jpg|thumb|right|Bolzano and the [[Alps]]]]

===Location===
The area of the city of Bolzano is {{cvt|52.3|km2|sqmi}}, of which {{cvt|28|km2|sqmi}} is used as a settlement area. The city is located in the basin where the [[Sarntal]], [[Eisacktal]], and the [[Etschtal|Adige Valley]] with their rivers, [[Talfer]], [[Eisack]], and [[Adige]], meet. In the Middle Ages, the two main Alpine crossings, the [[Via Claudia Augusta]] over [[Reschenpass]] and the Brenner route over [[Brenner Pass]], met in Bolzano. Thus, the city was very important for trading. The highest point is {{convert|1616|m|ft|abbr=off}} above sea level and the lowest point is {{convert|232|m|ft|abbr=off}} above sea level. The centre is located at an altitude of {{convert|262|m|ft|abbr=off}} above sea level. The nearest big cities are {{convert|58|km|mi|abbr=on}} ([[Trento]]) and {{convert|118|km|mi|abbr=on}} ([[Innsbruck]]) away.

===City districts and neighbouring communities===

City districts (most district names were originally in German and italianized at a later stage):
* Centro-Piani-Rencio/Zentrum-Bozner Boden-Rentsch
* Don Bosco/Don Bosco-Neugries
* Europa-Novacella/Europa-Neustift
* Gries-San Quirino/Gries-Quirein
* Oltrisarco-Aslago/Oberau-Haslach

In 1911 Zwölfmalgreien and in late 1925 the Gries municipality were incorporated in the Bolzano civic district. Neighbouring communities are: [[Eppan an der Weinstraße|Eppan]], [[Karneid]], [[Laives]], [[Deutschnofen]], [[Ritten]], [[Jenesien]], [[Terlan]] and [[Vadena]].

===Climate===
Being located at multiple climate borders, Bolzano features a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') with hot summers and very cold winters by Italian standards. According to the Trewartha classification, this climate could not be really considered a subtropical climate because fewer than 8 months are at least {{convert|10|°C|0}}, and thus would be considered a semi-continental climate with hot summers. Some of its suburbs are designated an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'') based on cooler summer temperatures, while mountains in the area may feature a continental climate (''Dfb''). The climate of Bolzano is influenced by its low altitude in a valley south of the main Alps. This causes very sheltered conditions from cool winds during daytime, ensuring much warmer temperatures year-round than in similar valley cities north of the range.

Through fascism and the [[Italianization]] policy under [[Benito Mussolini]] in the inter-war period, the Italian language group became the majority in Bolzano. Prior to the annexation of South Tyrol to Italy ([[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]], 1919) a small Italophone community of up to 10% of the population already lived in Bolzano.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://6612springbottomway.blogspot.com/2019/05/italian-bolzano-alto-adige.html|title=ITALIAN BOLZANO (ALTO ADIGE)|website=6612springbottomway.blogspot.com}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Bolzano}}

[[File:Bozen um 1898.jpg|thumb|right|Bolzano in 1898]]

=== Prehistory and Roman settlement ===
The modern-day Bolzano was in ancient times a marshy region inhabited by the [[Raeti]]an Isarci people, traditionally believed to be descendants of [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] refugees fleeing Italy from the invading Gauls.<ref>Pliny the Elder III.20</ref> The Romans built a settlement after the area had been conquered in 15 BC by general [[Nero Claudius Drusus]]. The military settlement, ''Pons Drusi'' (Drusus Bridge), was named after this Roman general. During this time the area became part of the region [[Venetia et Histria]] (Regio X) of [[Roman Italy|ancient Italy]].

In 1948, excavations of the current Cathedral led to the discovery of an ancient Christian basilica from the fourth century. Also discovered was a Roman cemetery, including the tomb of "Secundus Regontius" with Latin inscriptions dating to the third century, making him the oldest known inhabitant of Bolzano.<ref>Karl Maria Mayr (1949). "Der Grabstein des Regontius aus der Pfarrkirche in Bozen". ''[[Der Schlern]]'', 23, pp. 302-303.</ref>

=== Bavarian settlement ===
During the gradual decline of the Lombard influence in the seventh century, [[Bavaria]]n immigration took place and the first mention of a Bavarian ruler in Bolzano dates from 679.<ref>As reported by [[Paulus Diaconus]] in his ''Historia Langobardorum'', V 36, ed. Georg Waitz, [[Monumenta Germaniae Historica|MGH]] Scriptores rerum Langobardicarum, Hannover 1878, p. 35: ''comes Baioariorum quem illi gravionem dicunt''.</ref> At that time, the Bavarians named the nearby villages around Bolzano ''Bauzanum'' or ''Bauzana''.<ref>Richard Heuberger (1930). "[http://homepage.univie.ac.at/r.steinacher/downloads/Heuberger/30b-korr.pdf Natio Noricorum et Pregnariorum]". ''Veröffentlichungen des Museum Ferdinandeum in Innsbruck'', No. 10, p. 7.</ref> In 769 [[Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria]] issued in Bolzano the foundation charter of the [[Innichen Abbey]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Martin Bitschnau |author2= Hannes Obermair |title=Tiroler Urkundenbuch, II. Abteilung: Die Urkunden zur Geschichte des Inn-, Eisack- und Pustertals |volume= 1 |publisher=Universitätsverlag Wagner |place=Innsbruck |year=2009 |isbn=978-3-7030-0469-8 |pages=30–1 no. 50}}</ref> [[Germans|German]] populations have been present in the region of [[History of Tyrol|Tyrol]] from that period onwards. At around the year 1000, the settlement is called "in Pauzana valle, quae lingua Teutisca Pozana nuncupatur".<ref>Josef Widemann (1943). ''Die Traditionen des Hochstifts Regensburg und des Klosters St. Emmeram'' (Quellen und Erörterungen zur bayerischen und deutschen Geschichte, NF '''8'''). Munich: C.H. Beck, pp. 216-7, no. 259; Franz Huter (1937). ''Tiroler Urkundenbuch.'' '''I.1'''. Innsbruck: Wagner, no. 33.</ref>

=== Bishopric of Trent ===

[[File:BozenLaubenGasse.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Lauben]]

In 1027 the area of Bolzano and the rest of the Diocese was conferred upon the [[Prince-Bishopric of Trent|bishops of Trent]] by the [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Conrad II]] from the [[Salian dynasty]]. In the late-12th century, the bishop founded a [[market town]], along the ''Lauben'' thoroughfare. The town therefore became an important trading post on the Transalpine [[Augsburg]]-[[Venice]] route over the [[Brenner Pass]], elevation {{convert|1371|m|ft}} above sea level, within the [[Holy Roman Empire]].<ref>Hannes Obermair (2007). [http://cma.gbv.de/dr,cma,010,2007,a,03.pdf "'Bastard Urbanism'? Past Forms of Cities in the Alpine Area of Tyrol-Trentino"]. ''Concilium medii aevi'', 10, pp. 53-76, esp. pp. 64-66.</ref>

=== County of Tyrol ===
In 1277 Bolzano was conquered by [[Meinhard II]], the Count of Tyrol, leading to a struggle between the [[counts of Tyrol]] and the bishops of Trent. In 1363, the [[County of Tyrol]] passed to the Austrian [[House of Habsburg]]. In 1381, [[Leopold III, Duke of Austria|Duke Leopold]] granted the citizens of Bolzano the privilege of a town council. This gradually eliminated the influence and power previously held by the bishops of Trent over the next few decades. In 1462, the bishops eventually resigned all their rights of jurisdiction over the town.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=1 |wstitle=Botzen |volume=4 |page=311 |first=William |last=Coolidge |author-link=William Augustus Brevoort Coolidge}}</ref>

[[File:Bozen 1 (326).JPG|thumb|left|200px|Mercantile Building]]

[[File:Amtsraitung Bozen 1471 Hs 173.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The town's coat of arms as depicted in 1471 by the mayor Konrad Lerhueber]]

From the 14th and 15th centuries onwards, a large market fair was organised four times per year to greet tradesmen and merchants en-route the Brenner Pass. The Mercantile Magistrate was therefore founded in 1635 by the Austrian duchess [[Claudia de' Medici]]. During every market season, two Italian and two Germanic officers, who were appointed among the local tradesmen, worked in this magistrate office. The establishment of an official trade organisation strengthened Bolzano as a cultural crossroad in the Alps.<ref>Ferdinand Troyer (1648). ''Bozner Chronik (Cronica der statt Botzen)''. Bozen.</ref>

After the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806, Bolzano became briefly part of the Napoleonic [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] and was incorporated into the ''[[Department of Alto Adige]]''.<ref>Antony E. Alcock (1970). ''The History of the South Tyrol Question''. London: Michael Joseph, p. 9.</ref> After the [[Congress of Vienna|Congress of Vienna (1814-15)]] Bolzano returned to the [[County of Tyrol]], within the [[Austrian Empire]] and subsequently the [[Austria-Hungary|Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary]] in 1867. The County covered both modern-day [[South Tyrol]], [[Trentino]] and the federal state of [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] (including  [[East Tyrol]]) in Austria.

[[File:Geuter's city plan of Bozen-Bolzano in 1914.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Bolzano in 1914, at the outbreak of World War I]]

In 1915, the [[Triple Entente]] powers promised Italy territorial gains if she would enter the [[World War I|First World War]] on the side of the Entente instead of siding with the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria-Hungary]]. When Italy abandoned the [[Triple Alliance (1882)]], the Entente offered her territorial promises in [[Tyrol (state)|Tyrol]] and [[Istria]]. This secret arrangement was confirmed in the [[Treaty of London (1915)]].

After Italy declared war on Austria-Hungary on May 24, 1915, heavy fighting took place all along Tyrol's southern border for the entire duration of the conflict. For the next {{frac|3|1|2}} years Tyrol's southern border became the front line between Austro-Hungarian and Italian troops. Tyrol's south frontier was – and still is – dotted with tens of defensive fortresses that had been built in view of a possible Italian attack.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Losses on both sides amount to several thousands. During World War I, tens of thousands of civilians living along Tyrol's southern border were evacuated to either of the two countries, the majority to Bohemian and inner Austrian areas, and some to Italian internment camps, away from the front line.

=== Annexation by Italy ===

On November 3, 1918, the armistice of Villa Giusti, near Padova ended military operations between Italy and Austria-Hungary. Subsequently, Italian troops entered Tyrol and occupied the Austrian areas south of the Brenner Pass. Italian control of [[South Tyrol]] was internationally recognized in 1919. At the time of Bolzano's annexation by the [[Kingdom of Italy]] the town was settled primarily by a German-speaking population. As of 1910, 29,000 inhabitants identified themselves as German speakers and only 1,300 as Italian speakers, these latter ones mainly from the Italian speaking areas of Tyrol, namely Welschtirol, currently known as Trentino.<ref name="City of Bolzano publication">{{Cite web|url=http://www.comune.bolzano.it/UploadDocs/2729_Azzolini_ita.pdf|title=City of Bolzano publication}}</ref>
[[File:Bolzano, monumento alla vittoria (13995) 01.jpg|thumb|right|175px|[[Bolzano Victory Monument|Victory Monument]] ]]
Along with the rest of South Tyrol, Bolzano was subjected to an intensive [[Italianization of South Tyrol|Italianisation programme]] enforced by Fascist leader [[Benito Mussolini]] from the 1920s onwards to September 8, 1943, when Italy left the military alliance with Nazi Germany and South Tyrol fell under direct German control. The goal of such programme was to outnumber the local German-speaking population by tripling Bolzano's population through Italian immigration from other regions of Italy.<ref name="City of Bolzano publication"/> In 1927 Bolzano became the capital of the province of Bolzano. Any reference to and use of the words Tyrol and Tyrolean were banned by law and were punishable offences. In 1933, [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in the [[Weimar Republic]]. Mussolini and the Fascists worried that Hitler, in pursuing his ideology of ''all ethnic Germans under one Reich'', would claim South Tyrol from Italy. To avoid such a prospect, in 1939 Mussolini and Hitler signed the [[South Tyrol Option Agreement|Option Agreement]], by which Germany would renounce territorial claims over South Tyrol as Germany's ''Lebensraum'' (living space). Furthermore, ethnic South-Tyroleans who had opted to stay in South Tyrol and refused resettlement to the [[Third Reich]] were subjected to full-scale Italianisation, including loss of their German names and national identity, prohibition of schooling in German and use of German for their daily transactions.<ref>Claudio Corradetti (2013).

=== Second World War ===
During the [[World War II|Second World War]], Bolzano was the site of the [[Nazism|Nazi]]s' [[Bolzano Transit Camp]], a [[concentration camp]] for persecuted [[Jew]]s and political prisoners. Members of the Jewish population of Bolzano were deported to the death camps in Nazi Germany and murdered there.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mayr|first1=Sabine|last2=Obermair|first2=Hannes|year=2014|issn=0036-6145|title=Sprechen über den Holocaust.

After 1943, heavy fighting between Nazi Germany and the Allied Powers took place in the [[Dolomites]].<ref>Juliane Wetzel (1994). "Das Polizeidurchgangslager Bozen".

=== Capital of an autonomous province ===
After the War, the [[Gruber-De Gasperi Agreement]] of September 1946 was signed by the Italian and Austrian Foreign Ministers in Paris, guaranteeing "complete equality of rights" (including education and use of German as an official language) as well as "autonomous legislative and executive regional power" to the German-speaking population in South Tyrol and Trentino.<ref>{{cite web|title=Foreign Relations of the United States, 1946, Paris Peace Conference: Documents, Volume IV|url=https://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1946v04/d297|website=Office of the Historian, US State Department|access-date=26 July 2020}}</ref>

Because the implementation of the post-war agreement was not seen as satisfactory by the Austrian government (the autonomous province of 1947 [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|included Trentino]] and therefore had an Italian-speaking majority), it became a cause of significant friction with Italy and was brought to the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] in 1960, which called for a resolution of the issue.<ref>{{cite web|title=The UN's South Tyrol Resolution|url=https://www.hdgoe.at/suedtirolresolution-uno|publisher=House of Austrian History|access-date=26 July 2020}}</ref> A fresh round of negotiations took place in 1961 but proved unsuccessful, partly because of the campaign of terrorism by [[South Tyrolean Liberation Committee]] – a secessionist movement – against Italian police and electric power structures (one notable incident being the [[Night of Fire]] on 12 June 1961).

The issue was resolved in 1971, when a new statute of autonomy for the smaller, majority German-speaking province [[South Tyrol|Bozen – Südtirol/Bolzano – Alto Adige]], which was supported by the German-speaking population of South Tyrol, was granted by Italy. It resulted in a considerable level of self-government,<ref name="Danspeckgruber 2002 193">{{cite book|title=The Self-Determination of Peoples: Community, Nation, and State in an Interdependent World|last=Danspeckgruber|first=Wolfgang F.|year=2002|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers|isbn=1555877931|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KbwDwueS6AC&pg=PA193}}</ref> also due to the large financial resources of South Tyrol, which retains almost 90% of all levied taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=The South Tyrol Autonomy.

Bolzano is the biggest city in South Tyrol, which is an autonomous province in Northern Italy with a special statute. This statute preserves the rights of the German-speaking minority in Italy. This unique system was admired by the [[Dalai Lama]], who visited the city on several occasions to study a possible application in [[Tibet]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Dalai Lama erhielt Südtiroler Minderheitenpreis|url=http://www.stol.it/Artikel/Chronik-im-Ueberblick/Lokal/Dalai-Lama-erhielt-Suedtiroler-Minderheitenpreis|publisher=STOL|access-date=15 January 2014|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116134021/http://www.stol.it/Artikel/Chronik-im-Ueberblick/Lokal/Dalai-Lama-erhielt-Suedtiroler-Minderheitenpreis|archive-date=16 January 2014}} {{in lang|de}}</ref> It has also been presented as role model for the successful and fair resolution of inter-ethnic conflict to other regions of the world.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.provinz.bz.it/en/downloads/South-Tyrol-Autonomy.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821012516/http://www.provinz.bz.it/en/downloads/South-Tyrol-Autonomy.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Antony Alcock.
