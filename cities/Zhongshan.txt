'''Zhongshan''' ({{IPAc-cmn|zh|ong|1|-|sh|an|1}}; {{zh|c=中山}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in the south of the [[Pearl River Delta]] in [[Guangdong]] [[Provinces of China|province]], China. As of the 2020 census, the whole city with 4,418,060 inhabitants is now part of the Guangzhou–Shenzhen conurbation with 65,565,622 inhabitants.<ref name="citypopulation.de">{{cite web| url = https://www.citypopulation.de/en/china/guangdong/admin/| title = China: Guăngdōng (Prefectures, Cities, Districts and Counties) – Population Statistics, Charts and Map}}</ref> The city-core subdistricts used to be called '''Shiqi''' or '''Shekki''' ({{zh|c=石岐}}).

Zhongshan is one of the few Chinese cities to be named after a person. It was originally named Xiangshan ({{lang|zh|香山}}, "Fragrant Mountain"; [[Cantonese]]: ''Heung-saan''), but was renamed in 1925 in honor of [[Sun Yat-sen]], who is known in China as "Sun Zhongshan". Sun was the founding father of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] who is also regarded positively by the [[China|People's Republic]]. He was born in Cuiheng village in Nanlang Township of what was then [[Xiangshan County, Guangdong|Xiangshan County]]. 
[[File:Zhongshan983KN.jpg|thumb|Sunwen Lu (Road) West at dusk.]]

==Names==
Until 1925, Zhongshan was generally known as '''[[Xiangshan County, Guangdong|Xiangshan]]''' or '''Heung-san''' (Siangshan) ({{zh|c=香山 |l=Fragrant Mountain}}), in reference to the many flowers that grew in the mountains nearby.<ref>''Tai Ping Huan Yu Ji'' {{lang|zh-hans|《太平寰宇记》}}, ''juan'' 157, 3019.</ref> The city was renamed in honor of Sun Yat-sen, who had adopted the name Zhongshan. Sun is considered by both the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and the [[Republic of China]] to be the "[[Father of the Nation|Father of Modern China]]", and was from [[Cuiheng]] village – now part of [[Nanlang]] Town in Zhongshan.

==History==
{{main|Xiangshan County, Guangdong}}
Thousands of years ago, much of the Zhongshan area lay within the Pearl River estuary, with only scattered islands above the surface. Gradually from south to north, the area filled in with alluvial silt and became dry land. The northern parts of today's Zhongshan did not fill in until the time of the [[Ming dynasty]].

The Zhongshan area was part of an extended [[Dongguan]] County during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907&nbsp;AD), and was a significant [[sea salt]] producer. In 1082, during the [[Northern Song dynasty]], a fortified settlement called Xiangshan was founded in the area, marking the first official use of the name by which it would be known throughout most of its modern history. The prosperous settlement was then upgraded to a county in 1152. After the collapse of the [[Southern Song dynasty]], many descendants of Song court officials, including members of the imperial family, settled in Xiangshan. Significant land formation in the area of Zhongshan occurred since the [[Ming dynasty]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.zsnews.cn/news/index/view/cateid/37/id/686947.html | title=文化兴城 博物新志③ 为何？中山西北部出名士 华侨却是东南部多_新闻频道_中山网 }}</ref> Under the [[Qing dynasty]], embankments were built to prevent flooding in the new alluvial lands, and the area of cultivation was extended.

Much of the [[First Opium War]] took place in and around Xiangshan. In 1839, the official [[Lin Zexu]] arrived in Xiangshan and ordered the expulsion of [[Charles Elliot|Sir Charles Elliot]] and other British traders from the area. [[Qing dynasty]] soldiers resisted British attacks on the area in 1840, but were ultimately overwhelmed.

After the Opium Wars opened the region to foreign influence, a number of Xiangshan residents, including [[Sun Yat-sen|Sun Zhongshan]] (Yatsen), left to study overseas and were among the creators of modern China. Xiangshan was one of the first counties in China liberated as part of the [[Xinhai Revolution]]. After Sun Zhongshan's death in 1925, the commander-in-chief of the armed forces of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] decided to memorialize Sun by renaming his county of birth from Xiangshan to Zhongshan.

[[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist]] and [[People's Liberation Army|Communist]] units launched guerrilla attacks on Japanese occupancy forces and their [[Collaborationist Chinese Army|Collaborators]] beginning in 1942. On August 15, 1945, Japanese forces declared an unconditional surrender, and Zhongshan was liberated.

Zhongshan was the scene of fighting during the [[Chinese Civil War]] and was held for much of the war by Nationalists. On October 30, 1949, however, the [[People's Liberation Army]] defeated Nationalist forces in Zhongshan, and the county came under the control of the People's Republic of China.

In 1983, Zhongshan was elevated in administrative status from a county to a [[county-level city]] under the administration of [[Foshan]]. In 1988 Zhongshan became a [[prefecture-level city]].

==Geography and climate==
Zhongshan is located along the west side of the mouth of the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]], directly opposite [[Shenzhen]] and [[Hong Kong]]. It lies south of [[Guangzhou]] and [[Foshan]] and north of [[Zhuhai]] and [[Macau]]. The northern part of Zhongshan, including most of the urbanized area, lies on the alluvial plains of the [[Pearl River Delta]], while the southern part of the city's territory reaches into a range of coastal hills.<ref>{{cite news|last1=the office of Zhongshan Government |first1= |title=the overview of Zhongshan|url=http://www.zs.gov.cn/zjzs/zsgk/content/post_325055.html | publisher=Zhongshan Government}}</ref>

The most notable of these are the Wugui Hills ({{zh|c=五桂山|p=Wǔguī Shān|j=Ng<sup>5</sup>gwai<sup>3</sup> Saan<sup>1</sup>}}). The city's current geography is typical of southern China: numerous steep mountains and hills with alluvial plains in between down to the coastline. The main summit of the Wugui Hills is the highest point in the city, at {{convert|531|m|ft}} [[Above mean sea level|above sea level]].

Like nearly all of southern China, Zhongshan's climate is warm and humid most of the year, with an average temperature of {{convert|22|°C}} and {{convert|175|cm|in}} of [[rainfall]] each year. Southern China experiences fairly frequent [[typhoon]]s and [[thunderstorm]]s, and most rain falls between April and September.

==Cityscape==
[[File:Zhongshan968.jpg|thumb|Fufeng pagoda in Zhongshan Park.]]

Zhongshan is a city of numerous leafy [[park]]s, wide [[boulevards]], and [[monument]]s. Notable sights include:

* Sunwen Road West (or Sunwen Xilu) in Zhongshan Old Town, a [[pedestrian street|pedestrian mall]] lined with dozens of restored buildings from the colonial period in [[treaty port]] style. Several of these buildings were built in the 1920s.
* The seven-story Fufeng [[Chinese pagodas|Pagoda]], built in 1608 and visible from all over the city, is on a hill in Zhongshan Park, which abuts the western end of Sunwen Road West immediately to its north. A Sun Yat-sen memorial pavilion stands near the pagoda.
* Sunwen Memorial Park, at the southern end of Xingzhong Road, is the site of the largest [[bronze statue|bronze sculpture]] of Sun Yat-sen in the world.
Zhongshan, like many cities in China, has a rapidly changing cityscape with many new buildings under construction. Currently, the tallest completed buildings in the city are the two Zhongshan International Finance Center Towers. Tower 1 and Tower 2 both reach a height of {{convert|220|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} and are 55 stories tall. These will be eclipsed by the Perfect Eagle Golden Square tower, which will reach {{convert|238|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}}, with an expected completion date in 2018. The International Trade Center in [[Guzhen, Guangdong|Guzhen Town]], expected to be completed in 2019, will reach a height of {{convert|305|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} with 65 floors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skyscrapercenter.com/city/zhongshan|title=Zhongshan – The Skyscraper Center|website=www.skyscrapercenter.com|access-date=6 January 2018}}</ref>

==Administration==
Zhongshan is a [[prefecture-level city]] of the [[Guangdong]] [[Provinces of China|province]]. An uncommon administrative feature is that it has no [[County (People's Republic of China)|county-level]] division, but the municipal government does group the 24 township-level divisions into five district areas. The city government directly administers 8 [[Subdistricts of the People's Republic of China|Subdistricts]] and 15 [[Town of China|towns]]:

==Language==
Although the main ethnic group in Zhongshan is [[Han Chinese]], there is no one dominant language or dialect spoken making Zhongshan one of the most diverse cities in China. Dialects spoken in the city ranging from the more common [[Yue Chinese|Yue]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], and [[Min Chinese|Min]] dialects to the more local [[Shiqi dialect|Shiqi]], [[Shatian dialect|Shatian]], [[Longdu dialect|Longdu]], [[Nanlang dialect|Nanlang]], [[Sanxiang dialect|Sanxiang]], [[Guzhen dialect|Guzhen]], [[Sanjiao dialect|Sanjiao]], and [[Zhangjiabian dialect|Zhangjiabian]] dialects as well as [[Wuguishan dialect|Wuiguishan]], the only Hakka dialect in the city. The most common language, however, is [[Cantonese]].

* [[Shatian dialect]] – [[Xiqu Subdistrict, Zhongshan|Xiqu Subdistrict]], [[Tanzhou Town]], [[Shenwan|Shenwan Town]], [[Banfu|Banfu Town]], [[Henglan|Henglan Town]], [[Xiaolan|Xiaolan Town]], [[Dongfeng, Zhongshan|Dongfeng Town]], [[Nantou, Zhongshan|Nantou Town]], [[Huangpu, Zhongshan|Huangpu Town]], [[Minzhong|Minzhong Town]], [[Gangkou, Zhongshan|Gangkou Town]], [[Fusha, Zhongshan|Fusha Town]], [[Dongsheng, Zhongshan|Dongsheng Town]]

==Economy==
===Primary industries===
Primary productions are [[agricultural]], such as [[rice]], [[lychee]], [[banana]], and [[sugar cane]]. Added to this, [[horticulture]] in [[Xiaolan Town]] is famous throughout southern China for its blooming [[chrysanthemum and chickens]].

===Manufacturing industries===
Zhongshan, [[Dongguan]], [[Nanhai District|Nanhai]], and [[Shunde]] are dubbed the 'Four Little Tigers' in Guangdong. The proximity of Zhongshan to [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] is an advantage to its economic development, especially in manufacturing.

In the 1980s, Zhongshan had a relatively developed [[state-owned enterprise]] (SOE) sector that was used to stimulate [[Township and Village Enterprises]] (TVE) development in the countryside. Currently, the SOE sector is much weaker, and the economy is dominated by foreign investment and TVEs, and by specialized 'manufacturing towns'. Each of these towns specializes in making a particular product. Most of the towns have earned a reputation as leading manufacturers in their pillar industries.

These specialized manufacturing towns include:
* [[Dachong|Dachong Town]] for mahogany furniture
* [[Dongfeng, Zhongshan|Dongfeng Town]] for electric household appliances
* [[Guzhen, Zhongshan|Guzhen Town]] for lighting fixtures
* [[Huangpu Town]] for food processing
* [[Shaxi, Zhongshan|Shaxi Town]] for casual wear manufacturing
* [[Xiaolan|Xiaolan Town]] for locks and hardware, as well as for electronic acoustics products

The government of Zhongshan encourages "Research and Design" in the region by setting up national level research centres and specialized industrial regions. For example, the Zhongshan National Torch High-Tech Industrial Development Zone ({{lang|zh-hans|中山国家级火炬高技术产业开发区}}) was established in 1990 in the east of the city by the Ministry of Science and Technology and the governments of Guangdong province and Zhongshan. Zhongshan Port, which ranks among the top 10 ports nationwide in container-handling capacity, is in the zone.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/zhongshan-huoju-hi-tech-industrial-development-zone |title=Zhongshan Torch Hi-tech Industrial Development Zone |work=rightsite.asia |year=2014 |access-date=13 July 2014}}</ref> Since 2001, it has included the Zhongshan Electronic Base of China ({{lang|zh-hans|中国电子中山基地}}) for its reputation in the electronic [[acoustics]] industry. Following possible development in [[Nansha, Guangzhou|Nansha]], the city considers its eastern part, of which {{convert|400|km²|0|abbr=off}} of land is available, a focus of future development.

Currently, the city is trying to re-organize its fragmented industrialization. Meanwhile, the light and [[labour-intensive industry]] characteristic of the local economy faces the problem of a shortage of land in Zhongshan.
