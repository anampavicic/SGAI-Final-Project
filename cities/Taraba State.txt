==Politics==
The state government is led by a democratically elected governor who works closely with members of the state's House of Assembly. The capital city of the state is Jalingo.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oguntola |first=Tunde |date=2022-09-27 |title=2023: Next President, Govs Must Get Two-thirds Spread, Says INEC |url=https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |access-date=2023-02-24 |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Electoral system==
The governor of the state is selected using a modified two-round system. To be elected in the first round, a candidate must receive a plurality of votes and over 25% of votes in at least two-thirds of the state and local government areas. If no candidate passes the threshold, a second round will be held between the top candidate and the next candidate to have received a plurality of votes in the highest number of local government areas.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Oguntola |first=Tunde |date=2022-09-27 |title=2023: Next President, Govs Must Get Two-thirds Spread, Says INEC |url=https://leadership.ng/2023-next-president-govs-must-get-two-thirds-spread-says-inec/ |access-date=2023-02-24 |language=en-US}}</ref>
