'''Manizales''' ({{IPA|es|maniˈzales}})  is a city in central [[Colombia]]. It is the capital of the [[Caldas Department|Department of Caldas]], and lies near the [[Nevado del Ruiz]] [[volcano]].

Currently, the city is the main center for the production of [[Colombian coffee]] and an important hub for higher educational institutions.

==History==
Manizales was founded on October 12, 1849. The city was founded by a group of twenty [[Antioquia Department|Antioquians]] (''The Expedition of the 20''), who came from [[Neira, Caldas|Neira]] and [[Salamina, Caldas|Salamina]].

==Geography==
Manizales is the capital city of one of the smallest Colombian departments. The city is described as having an "abrupt [[topography]]", and lies on the Colombian Central Mountain Range (part of the longest continental mountain range, the [[Andes]]), with a great deal of ridgelines and steep slopes, which, combined with the seismic instability of the area, has required architectural adaptations and public works to make the city safer. Even though Manizales has this very difficult topography, there are many coffee plantations in its fertile lands. The city is located in the northern part of the [[Colombian Coffee-Growers Axis]] ("Eje Cafetero"), near the volcano [[Nevado del Ruiz]], which has an altitude of 5,321 meters (17,457.3&nbsp;ft).

It is in the basin of the Chinchiná River and sub-basin of the Guacaica River. Its natural threats are earthquakes, mudslides, and volcanic eruptions.

==Climate==
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Manizales is ''Cfb'', a [[subtropical highland climate]] but ever moist.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en.climate-data.org/south-america/colombia/caldas/manizales-3538/ |title=Manizales climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Manizales weather averages - Climate-Data.org |website=en.climate-data.org |access-date=February 15, 2019 |archive-date=September 24, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240924074311/https://en.climate-data.org/south-america/colombia/caldas/manizales-3538/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Lower elevations approach an [[Tropical rainforest climate|equatorial climate]] (''Af'') as found in the plains.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=592499&cityname=Manizales,+Caldas,+Colombia&units= |title=Manizales, Colombia Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase) |website=Weatherbase |access-date=February 15, 2019 |archive-date=September 24, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240924074201/http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=592499&cityname=Manizales,+Caldas,+Colombia&units= |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite being located in the tropics, the city seldom gets very hot, featuring spring-like temperatures throughout the year owing to its high altitude. There are only two seasons in the city: the wet and dry seasons that alternate throughout the year, with each lasting about three months. Monthly averages are quite uniform. Manizales receives about {{convert|1500|mm|0}} of precipitation a year, with October being wettest.

==Economy==
[[File:El ruiz volcano.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Nevado del Ruiz]] of [[Los Nevados National Park]] seen from the city]]
Its core economy has traditionally been the cultivation and production of [[coffee]]. This fomented the creation of new types of employment and several factories, some of which remain in the metropolitan area while others have reduced their operations or moved to other cities aggravating the unemployment problem. These companies manufacture products such as liquor, shoes, rubber, chocolate, banks, detergents and soaps, threshing and packaged coffee, software, and metallurgy,  among others. In addition, there are institutions and companies involved in the coffee sector as the Departmental Committee of Coffee Growers of Caldas, Almacafé, Cenicafé, and a number of other industries involved in the process of coffee (threshers, cooperatives, exporters).

During the latter half of the twentieth century, many universities were founded in the city to the point that some studies regard Manizales as the second largest University city in the country. The universities are attended by students from various regions of the country such as Tolima, Risaralda, Valle, Quindio, Antioquia, Nariño and Huila, among others.

The service sector has thrived, mostly in the form of call centers, and this has become one of the city's primary economic activities.

Manizales won first place in the special category of business promotion in the V Iberoamerican Digital Cities Award, organized by the Latin American Association of Research Centers and Telecommunication Enterprises (AHCIET). In a 2010 study conducted by the World Bank, Manizales was ranked as the best and easiest Colombian city to do business.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Main roads ===
The city's mountainous topography causes journeying in an east–west direction and vice versa to be flatter and faster than going north–south or south–north; therefore the main parallel thoroughfares are the Santander, Paralela, and Kevin Ángel, and are arranged longitudinally most of the city's length. The few avenues with a north–south or south–north are the Avenida Centenario and Avenida 12 de Octubre; the former is more important, for it connects downtown with the main transport hub where major access routes merge towards the city.

* '''Avenida Santander''' was the first main road of the city, formerly called Cervantes, and remains the most important motorway of the city. Its four lanes travel in the east–west–east direction. This roadway spans the entire Carrera-23 in the downtown area all the way to Calle 71 in the Battalion sector. Surrounding it are some of the most important landmarks of the city such as: [[Founders Theatre]], Plaza 51, The Triangle, Panorama Towers, [[University of Caldas]], Catholic University, Cervantes Building, Park Antonio Nariño, Instituto Universitario de Caldas, Herbeo Tower, General Cable Plaza and the Zona Rosa.
* '''Avenida Paralela''' was the city's second main road. It also has four lanes moving between west and east, and as its name attests, it runs parallel to Avenida Santander. This road spans from downtown to Calle 71 in the Palermo neighborhood. It passes by some iconic places such as San Estéban Cemetery, [[University of Caldas]], [[Palogrande Stadium]].
* '''Avenida Alberto Mendoza Hoyos'''
* '''Avenida Kevin Ángel'''
* '''Avenida Panamericana'''

=== Manizales Aerial Tramway ===
Manizales [[Aerial tramway|Aerial Tramway]] was inaugurated on October 30, 2009. It connects downtown Manizales with the regional bus station, with a length of {{convert|2.1|km|1|abbr=on}}. Each gondola has a seating capacity of ten passengers, the whole system can carry 2,100 persons per hour. Owing to its success, the [[gondola lift]] was extended in 2013, and now connects also the suburb of Villamaria.

The entire Aerial Tramway was built by the Italian manufacturer Leitner ropeways.  Currently it has four stations on its route: Downtown Manizales, La Fuente, Manizales Los Cambulos Bus Terminal, and Villamaria.

=== Air transportation ===
Manizales has a domestic airport called [[La Nubia Airport]] which has a runway of about 1,400 meters and provides services from 6 am to 6 pm. Due to foggy weather conditions, it is often closed due to low visibility. Meanwhile, the existence of buildings over two stories close to the landing head make it topographically unfeasible to expand the airport, which in turn has become an obstacle to regional development;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dnp.gov.co/PortalWeb/Portals/0/archivos/documentos/Subdireccion/Conpes/3270.pdf |language=es |title=Documento Conpes 3270 |page=2 |access-date=August 16, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620072802/http://www.dnp.gov.co/PortalWeb/Portals/0/archivos/documentos/Subdireccion/Conpes/3270.pdf |archive-date=June 20, 2009 }}</ref> For these reasons, the International Coffee Airport is being built within the metropolitan area, in the town of [[Palestina, Caldas|Palestina]], 25 minutes from Manizales. At an altitude of 1,525 m, the airport will have a runway of 2,800 meters which could be extended to 3,500 meters in order to receive long-range aircraft. It is expected that the new airport will function 24/7. It is currently being studied for its adequacy in terms of [[ground motion]].

==Arts and culture==
The most important cultural events held in the city are the Manizales International Theater Festival,<ref name="urlFestival de Manizales">{{cite web |url=http://www.festivaldemanizales.org |title=Festival de Manizales |language=es |access-date=March 27, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301071718/http://www.festivaldemanizales.org/ |archive-date=March 1, 2012 }}</ref> which is one of the major theater events in Latin America created in 1968 by initiative of Carlos Ariel Betancur, and the Manizales Jazz Festival, which gathers jazz musicians from all over the world; both are held annually.

The Manizales Fair was created in 1951 on the first centenary of the city.<ref name="urlFeria de Manizales">{{cite web |url=http://www.colombia.travel/es/turista-internacional/actividad/historia-y-tradicion/ferias-y-fiestas/enero/feria-de-manizales# |title=Feria de Manizales: lo más destacado de la tradición taurina en América en el escenario del café |language=es |access-date=March 27, 2012 }}</ref> It began with bullfights and the typical "Manolas" parade (Spanish procession). Due to its hospitality, more shows and presentations have been brought into the fair, such as the International Coffee Beauty Pageant which together with the bullfighting season are the main events of the fair. Currently the fair includes activities such as horseback riding parades, artisanal fairs, "trova" concerts, other parades, sports, national and international musicians and bands, horse and livestock contests, and cultural shows. It is an important celebration in Colombia, as is the [[Barranquilla Carnival]].

===Coffee International Beauty Pageant===

Coffee International Beauty Pageant (from {{langx|es|link=no|Reinado Internacional del Café}}) is an international beauty pageant held annually in Manizales as part of the ''Feria de Manizales'', a feast promoting the region known for its flagship product, coffee.

The current winner is [[Maydeliana Liyimar Diaz]], from [[Venezuela]].

The international beauty contest originally began in 1957 and was held every two years (1957, 1959, 1961, 1963) under the name of Continental Queen of Coffee. However, to give a wider scope, in 1972 its name was changed to Miss International Queen of Coffee Pageant, thereby increasing the participation of coffee-producing countries from other continents. Manizales is the permanent home since its inception.
