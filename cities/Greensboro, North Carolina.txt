In 1808, Greensboro was planned around a central courthouse square to succeed [[Guilford Court House, North Carolina|Guilford Court House]] as the county seat. The county courts were thus placed closer to the county's geographical center, a location more easily reached at the time by the majority of the county's citizens, who traveled by horse or on foot.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://greensborohistory.org/exhibits-explore/early-greensborough|title=Voices of a City: Early Greensborough|website=Greensboro History Museum|access-date=November 27, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.visitgreensboronc.com/about-us/greensboro-history/|title=Greensboro History: Who Put the Green in Greensboro?|website=Greensboro Area Convention & Visitors Bureau|access-date=November 27, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://townsquarepublications.com/history-of-greensboro-nc/|title=History of Greensboro, NC|website=Town Square Publications|date=September 8, 2019 |access-date=November 27, 2022}}</ref> Three major Interstate Highways ([[Interstate 40 in North Carolina|Interstate 40]], [[Interstate 85 in North Carolina|Interstate 85]], and [[Interstate 73 in North Carolina|Interstate 73]]) in the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] region of central North Carolina were built to intersect at this city.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Greensboro, North Carolina}}

===Early history===
Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the inhabitants of the area that became Greensboro were the Saura, a [[Siouan languages|Siouan]]-speaking people.<ref name="Arnett1955">{{cite book| first1=Ethel Stephens| last1=Arnett| title=Greensboro, North Carolina: The County Seat of Guilford |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qEATAAAAYAAJ |access-date=January 9, 2017| year=1955| publisher=University of North Carolina Press}}</ref>{{rp|7}} Other indigenous cultures had occupied this area for thousands of years, typically settling along the waterways, as did the early settlers.

[[Quaker]] migrants from Pennsylvania, by way of [[Maryland]], arrived at Capefair (now Greensboro) in about 1750. The new settlers began organized religious services affiliated with the [[Cane Creek Friends Meeting]] in [[Snow Camp, North Carolina|Snow Camp]] in 1751.<ref name=Hinshaw>{{cite book| last1=Hinshaw| first1=William Wade| last2=(Marshall| first2=Thomas Worth, compiler)| title=Encyclopedia of American Quaker Genealogy, vol. 1| year=1991| publisher=Genealogical Publishing Co.| location=[[Baltimore]]| isbn=0806301783| pages=[https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam00gene/page/487 487–488]| chapter=New Garden Monthly Meeting, Guilford County, NC| chapter-url-access=registration| chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofam00gene/page/487}}</ref> Three years later, 40 Quaker families were granted approval to establish New Garden Monthly Meeting.<ref name=Hinshaw /> The action is recorded in the minutes of the [[Perquimans County|Perquimans]] and Little River Quarterly Meeting on May 25, 1754: "To Friends at New Garden in Capefair", signed by Joseph Ratliff.<ref name=NCG>{{cite web| title=Quaker Meetings: Meetings in and Near Guilford County – Center Monthly Meeting| url=http://ncgenweb.us/nc/guilford/quaker-meetings/| work=Guilford County, NCGenWeb| publisher=NCGenWeb| access-date=January 9, 2017| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816233251/http://ncgenweb.us/nc/guilford/quaker-meetings/| archive-date=August 16, 2016| url-status=dead}}</ref> The settlement grew rapidly over the next three years, adding members from as far away as [[Nantucket]], Massachusetts.<ref name=Hinshaw /> It soon became North Carolina's most important Quaker community and the mother of several other Quaker meetings established in the state and west of the [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachians]].<ref name=Hinshaw />

After the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], the city of Greensboro was named for Major General [[Nathanael Greene]], commander of the rebel American forces at the [[Battle of Guilford Court House]] on March 15, 1781.<ref name="Arnett1955"/>{{rp|20}} Although the Americans lost the battle, Greene's forces inflicted heavy casualties on the British Army of General [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|Cornwallis]]. After the battle, Cornwallis withdrew his troops to a British coastal base in [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/david-mccullough_glorious-cause-america/ |title=The Glorious Cause of America |first=David |last=McCullough |publisher=Speeches.byu.edu |date=September 27, 2005 |access-date=January 9, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-revolution/4235 |title=The Battle of Guilford Courthouse |work=North Carolina Department of Cultural Resources, Office of Archives and History |publisher=Learnnc.org |access-date=January 9, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126070832/http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-revolution/4235 |archive-date=January 26, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
[[File:Battle of Guilford Courthouse 15 March 1781.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Guilford Court House|Battle of Guilford Courthouse]]]]

Greensboro was established near the geographic center of Guilford County, on land that was "an unbroken forest with thick undergrowth of [[huckleberry]] bushes, that bore a finely flavored fruit."<ref>Stockard, Sallie W. ''The History of Guilford County, North Carolina''. Knoxville, Tennessee, 1902. p. 37</ref> Property for the future village was purchased from the Saura for $98. Three north–south streets (Greene, Elm, Davie) were laid out intersecting with three east–west streets, Gaston, Market, and Sycamore.<ref name="Arnett1955"/>{{rp|171–174, 21}} The courthouse was built at the center of the intersection of Elm and Market streets. By 1821, the town was home to 369 residents.

[[File:BlandwoodMansion.jpg|thumb|[[Blandwood Mansion and Gardens|Blandwood Mansion]], by Alexander Jackson Davis]]
In the early 1840s, the state government designated Greensboro as one of the stops on a new railroad line, at the request of Governor [[John Motley Morehead]], whose house, [[Blandwood]], was in Greensboro. Stimulated by rail traffic and improved access to markets, the city grew substantially, soon becoming known as the "Gate City" due to its role as a transportation hub for the Piedmont.<ref name=Fripp>{{Cite book| last1=Fripp| first1=Gayle Hicks| title=Greensboro, a Chosen Center| location=[[Sun Valley, California]]| publisher=American Historical Press| year=2001}}</ref>{{rp|66}} The railroads transported goods to and from the cotton [[textile]] mills. Many of the manufacturers developed workers' housing in mill villages near their facilities.

Though the city developed slowly, early wealth generated in the 18th and 19th centuries from cotton trade and merchandising resulted in owners' constructing several notable buildings. The earliest, later named [[Blandwood Mansion and Gardens]], was built by a farmer in 1795. Additions to this residence in 1846, designed by [[Alexander Jackson Davis]], made the house influential as America's earliest [[Tuscany|Tuscan]]-style villa. It has been designated a [[National Historic Landmark]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://preservationgreensboro.org/blandwood-mansion| title=Governor Morehead's Blandwood Mansion| date=28 April 2015| publisher=Preservation Greensboro| access-date=January 7, 2017}}</ref> Other significant houses and estates were developed, including Dunleith, designed by [[Samuel Sloan (architect)|Samuel Sloan]]; Bellemeade; and the [[Bumpas-Troy House|Bumpass-Troy House]]. Since the late 20th century, the latter has been adapted and operates as a private inn.

===Civil War and last days of the Confederacy===
In the mid-19th century, many of the residents of the Piedmont and western areas of the state were [[Union (American Civil War)|Unionist]], and Guilford County did not vote for [[secession in the United States|secession]]. But once North Carolina joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], some citizens joined the Confederate cause, forming infantry units such as the Guilford Grays to fight in the [[American Civil War]]. From 1861 to March 1865 the city was relatively untouched by the war, although residents had to deal with regional shortages of clothing, medicine, and other items caused by the US naval blockade of the South.

In the war's final weeks, Greensboro played a unique role in the last days of the Confederate government. In April 1865, the commanding officer of the Army of Tennessee, General [[Joseph E. Johnston]], instructed General [[P. G. T. Beauregard]] to prepare to defend the city. During this time, [[President of the Confederate States of America|Confederate President]] [[Jefferson Davis]] and the remaining members of the Confederate cabinet had evacuated the Confederate Capital in [[Richmond, Virginia]], and moved south to [[Danville, Virginia]].

When Union cavalry threatened Danville, Davis and his cabinet managed to escape by train, and reassembled in Greensboro on April 11, 1865. While in the city, Davis and his cabinet decided to try to split up and make their way [[Trans-Mississippi Theater|west of the Mississippi River]] to continue the war effort and avoid capture. Shortly thereafter, the cabinet left Greensboro and separated. Greensboro is notable as the last place where the entire Confederate government met as a group; some consider it the Confederacy's final capital city.<ref name="Robinson, Blackwell P. 1980">{{Cite book| last1=Robinson| first1=Blackwell P.| first2=Alexander R.| last2=Stoesen| title=The History of Guilford County, North Carolina, U.S.A. to 1980, A.D| editor=Sydney M.

Once surrender negotiations were completed at [[Bennett Place]] (in present-day [[Durham, North Carolina|Durham]]) between General Johnston and General Sherman on April 26, 1865, Confederate soldiers in Greensboro stacked their arms, received their paroles, and headed home.

===Industrialization and growth===
[[File:White Oak Mills Greensboro NC 1909.jpg|thumb|White Oak Mill in 1909]]

After the war, investors worked to restore the textile mills and related industry. In the 1890s, the city continued to attract attention from northern industrialists, including Moses and Caesar<!-- the non-classical spelling is correct, please do not change --> Cone of [[Baltimore]].<ref name="Arnett1955" />{{rp|171–174}} The Cone brothers established large-scale textile plants, changing Greensboro from a village to a city within a decade. By 1900, Greensboro was considered a center of the Southern textile industry, with large-scale factories producing [[denim]], [[flannel]], and [[overall]]s.<ref name = Fripp/>{{rp|59}} The resulting prosperity was expressed in the construction of notable 20th-century civic architecture, including the [[Guilford County Courthouse]], [[West Market Street United Methodist Church]] by S. W. Faulk, several buildings designed by Frank A. Weston, and the [[Julius I. Foust Building]] of the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]], designed by [[Orlo Epps]].

During the 20th century, Greensboro continued to increase in population and wealth. Grand commercial and civic buildings, many of which still stand today, were designed by local architects Charles Hartmann and Harry Barton. Other notable industries became established in the city, including [[Vicks|Vicks Chemical Co.]] (known for over-the-counter cold remedies such as [[Vicks VapoRub|VapoRub]] and [[NyQuil]]), Carolina Steel Corporation, and Pomona Terra Cotta Works.<ref name="Robinson, Blackwell P. 1980"/>{{rp|220}} During the first three decades, Greensboro grew so rapidly that there was an acute worker housing shortage. Builders set a construction goal of 80 to 100 affordable housing units per year to provide homes for workers.<ref name="Robinson, Blackwell P. 1980"/>{{rp|209}} Greensboro's real estate was considered "the wonder of the state" in the 1920s. Growth continued even through the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], as Greensboro attracted an estimated 200 new families per year.<ref name="Robinson, Blackwell P. 1980"/>{{rp|210}} The city earned a reputation as a well-planned community with a strong emphasis on education, parks, and a profitable employment base.

Greensboro has two major public research universities, [[North Carolina A&T State University]], a [[historically black college]] established in the late 19th century, and the [[University of North Carolina at Greensboro]]. During the height of the [[civil rights movement]] in the early 1960s, students from A&T were the major force in protests to achieve racial justice, desegregation of public facilities, and fair employment, beginning with the [[Greensboro Four]], who sat in at the segregated lunch counter at [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] in 1960 to gain service. The largest civil rights protests in North Carolina history took place in Greensboro in May and June 1963. In the 21st century, the universities are leaders in new areas of research in high tech and science, on which the city hopes to build a new economy.

Wartime and postwar prosperity brought development, and designs commissioned from nationally and internationally known architects. [[Walter Gropius]], a leader of the German [[Bauhaus]] movement in the United States, designed a factory building in the city in 1944.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://preservationgreensboro.org/walter-gropius-in-the-gate-city-2/ |title=Walter Gropius in the Gate City |publisher=Preservation Greensboro |last=Briggs |first=Benjamin |date=October 2, 2015 |access-date=January 9, 2017 |archive-date=January 10, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170110015347/https://preservationgreensboro.org/walter-gropius-in-the-gate-city-2/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Greensboro-based Ed Loewenstein designed projects throughout the region. [[Eduardo Catalano]] and [[George Matsumoto]] were hired for projects whose designs have challenged North Carolinians with modernist architectural concepts and forms.

===Civil rights movement===
{{Main|Greensboro sit-ins}}
In 1960, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Greensboro's population as 74.0% white and 25.8% black.<ref name="census1">{{cite web|title=Historical Census Statistics on Population Totals by Race, 1790 to 1990, and by Hispanic Origin, 1970 to 1990, for Large Cities and Other Urban Places in the United States |last1=Gibson |first1=Campbell |last2=Jung |first2=Kay |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |access-date=January 9, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120812191959/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0076/twps0076.html |archive-date=August 12, 2012 }}</ref> As in the rest of the state, most blacks were still [[Disenfranchisement after the Reconstruction Era|disenfranchised]] under state laws, [[Jim Crow laws]] and customs were in effect, and public facilities, including schools, were racially segregated by law. This was after the U.S. Supreme Court's 1954 ruling in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' that segregation in public schools was unconstitutional. Facilities reserved for blacks were generally underfunded by the state and city governments, which were dominated by conservative white Democrats.

In the postwar period, blacks in North Carolina and across the South pushed to regain their constitutional rights. College students from [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University|North Carolina Agricultural and Technical College]] (A&T), a [[historically black college]], made Greensboro a center of protests and change. On February 1, 1960, [[Greensboro sit-ins|four black college students]] sat down at an "all-white" [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]] [[lunch counter]], and refused to leave after they were denied service. They had already purchased items in other parts of the store and kept their receipts. After being denied lunch service, they brought out the receipts, asking why their money was good everywhere else in the store but not at the lunch counter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/topicalessays/busdesegsitins.aspx |title=Civil Rights Greensboro |publisher=UNCG Digital Collections |access-date=January 9, 2017 |archive-date=June 30, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140630033454/http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/topicalessays/busdesegsitins.aspx |url-status=dead }}</ref> Hundreds of supporters soon joined in this sit-in, which lasted several months. Such protests quickly spread across the South, ultimately leading to the [[Desegregation in the United States|desegregation]] of lunch counters and other facilities at Woolworth's and other chains.

Woolworth's went out of business due to changes in 20th-century retail practices, but the original Woolworth's lunch counter and stools are still in their original location. The former Woolworth's building has been adapted as the [[International Civil Rights Center and Museum]], which opened on February 1, 2010, the 50th anniversary of the sit-ins.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nancy H. |last=McLaughlin|url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2010/02/01/article/countless_acts_of_heroism|title=Countless acts of heroism |date=February 2, 2010 |newspaper=News-Record.com |access-date=August 11, 2012 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910091311/http://www.news-record.com/content/2010/02/01/article/countless_acts_of_heroism|archive-date=September 10, 2012}}</ref> A section of the counter is on display at the [[Smithsonian]] in Washington, D.C. to mark the protesters' courage.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Courage-at-the-Greensboro-Lunch-Counter.html |title=Courage at the Greensboro Lunch Counter |last=Edwards |first=Owen |work=Smithsonian Magazine |date=February 2010 |access-date=January 9, 2017 |archive-date=December 24, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224105136/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/Courage-at-the-Greensboro-Lunch-Counter.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>
[[File:Former Woolworth store in Greensboro, NC (2008).jpg|thumb|Former Woolworth's store, now the [[International Civil Rights Center and Museum]]]]

The white business community acceded to the desegregation of Woolworth's and made other minor concessions, but the civil rights movement had additional goals, holding protests in 1962 and 1963. In May and June 1963, the largest civil rights protest in North Carolina history took place in Greensboro. Protesters sought desegregation of public accommodations, and economic and social justice, such as hiring policies based on merit rather than race. They also worked for the overdue integration of public schools.

Each night more than 2,000 protesters marched through Greensboro's segregated central business district. William Thomas and A. Knighton Stanley, coordinators of Greensboro's local [[Congress of Racial Equality|CORE]] chapter, invited [[Jesse Jackson]], then an activist student at A&T, to join the protests. Jackson quickly rose to prominence as a student leader, becoming the public spokesman of the non-violent protest movement. Seeking to overwhelm city jails, as was done in protests led by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], the protesters invited arrest by violating segregation rules of local businesses; they were charged with [[trespass]]ing and other nonviolent actions. College and high school students constituted most of the protesters, and at one point approximately 1,400 blacks were jailed in Greensboro. The scale of protests disrupted the business community and challenged the leadership of the mayor and Governor [[Terry Sanford]].

Finally, the city and business community responded with further desegregation of public facilities, reformed hiring policies in city government, and commitments to progress by both Sanford and Greensboro's mayor. Sanford declared, "Anyone who hasn't received this message doesn't understand human nature." Significant changes in race relations still came at a painfully slow pace, and the verbal commitments from white leadership in 1963 were not implemented in substantial ways.<ref>{{cite book |first=William |last=Chafe |title=Civilities and Civil Rights |location=New York |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1980 |pages=119–152 }}</ref>

===Dudley High School/A&T protests===
{{Main|1969 Greensboro uprising}}
In May 1969, students of [[James B. Dudley High School]] were outraged when the administration refused to let a popular candidate, Claude Barnes, run for [[Students' union|student union]] class president, allegedly due to his membership in Youth for the Unity of Black Society.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://libcdm1.uncg.edu/cdm/essay1969/collection/CivilRights|title=Civil Rights Greensboro: Dudley High School/NC A&T University Disturbances, May 1969 |work=University of North Carolina Greensboro Library |access-date=March 29, 2019}}</ref> After their appeals to the school were rejected, the students asked activists at North Carolina A&T State University for support in a protest.<ref>{{cite book| last=Waller |first=Signe| title=Love and Revolution: A Political Memoir: People's History of the Greensboro Massacre, Its Setting and Aftermath| date=1 November 2002| publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield]] | isbn=978-0-7425-1365-5|page=49}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.library.ncat.edu/resources/archives/grimes.html |title=Willie Grimes |publisher=North Carolina A&T University, Bluford Library |access-date=September 2, 2012 |archive-date=December 20, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220131955/http://www.library.ncat.edu/resources/archives/grimes.html |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=Advisory>{{cite book| author=North Carolina Advisory Committee on Civil Rights| title=Trouble in Greensboro: A Report of an Open Meeting Concerning Disturbances at Dudley High School and North Carolina A&T State University| date=March 1970| url=http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/item.aspx?i=38| access-date=2012-09-03| archive-date=2013-05-22| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522023853/http://library.uncg.edu/dp/crg/item.aspx?i=38| url-status=dead}}</ref> Protests escalated and after students at A&T had thrown rocks at police, they returned on May 21 armed with [[tear gas]] canisters, using them against the crowds. The [[1969 Greensboro uprising|uprising]] grew larger, and the governor ordered the National Guard to back up local police.

After there were exchanges of gunfire, the governor ordered the [[North Carolina National Guard]] into the A&T campus, in what was described at the time as "the most massive armed assault ever made against an American university".<ref>{{cite book |last=Biondi |first=Martha |title=The Black Revolution on Campus |date=July 2, 2012 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=978-0-520-95352-9 |page=158}}</ref> The North Carolina National Guard swept the college dormitories, taking hundreds of students into "protective custody". The demonstrations were suppressed. The North Carolina State Advisory Committee to the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] investigated the disturbances; its 1970 report concluded that the National Guard invasion was a reckless action disproportionate to the danger posed by student protests. It criticized local community leaders for failing to respond adequately to the Dudley High School students when the issues first arose. They declared it "a sad commentary that the only group in the community who would take the Dudley students seriously were the students at A&T State University".<ref name="Advisory" />

In November 1980, six KKK defendants were acquitted in a state criminal trial by an all-white jury after a week of deliberation. Families of those killed and injured in the attack filed a civil suit against the city and police department for failure to protect citizens. In 1985, a jury in this case found five police officers and two other individuals liable for $350,000 in damages; the monies were to be paid to the Greensboro Justice Fund, established to advance civil rights.

=== 21st century ===
Textile companies and related businesses continue into the 21st century, when most went bankrupt, reorganized, and/or merged with other companies as textile manufacturing jobs moved offshore. Greensboro is still a major center of the textile industry, with the main offices of Elevate Textiles (Cone, Burlington Industries), Galey & Lord, Unifi, and [[VF Corporation]] ([[Wrangler Jeans|Wrangler]], [[Lee (Jeans)|Lee]], [[The North Face]], and [[Nautica (clothing company)|Nautica]]). [[ITG Brands]], maker of Kool, Winston and Salem brand cigarettes and the nation's third-largest tobacco company is headquartered in Greensboro. 

Rail traffic continues to be important for the city's economy, as Greensboro is a major regional freight hub. Twelve [[Amtrak]] passenger trains also stop in Greensboro daily. The Crescent has its platform on the main [[Norfolk Southern Railway|Norfolk Southern]] line between [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and [[New Orleans]] by way of [[Atlanta]]. The [[Carolinian (train)|Carolinian]] and [[Piedmont (train)|Piedmont]] trains have their platform at the start of Norfolk Southern [[List of Norfolk Southern Railway lines|NC-Line]] that runs from Greensboro to Goldsboro, NC.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], Greensboro has an area of {{convert|136.65|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|131.41|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|5.24|sqmi}} (3.83%) is water.<ref name="TigerWebMapServer"/>

The city of Greensboro lies among the rolling hills of North Carolina's [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], midway between the state's [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]] and [[Great Smoky Mountains]] to the west and the Atlantic beaches and [[Outer Banks]] to the east. The view of Greensboro from its highest building—the Lincoln Financial tower, commonly known as the Jefferson-Pilot Building after its previous owner,—shows an expanse of shade trees in the city.

In 1998, [[FedEx]] built a $300 million mid-Atlantic air-cargo and sorting hub at [[Piedmont Triad International Airport]], after an intensive competition for the hub among other regions of the state, as well as locations in [[South Carolina]]. The project was challenged in court based on the quality of planned noise and pollution abatements from neighborhoods near the site. The hub opened in 2009. Originally projected by FedEx to employ 750 people in its first two years of operation and eventually 1,500, local FedEx employment has been nearly the same as before the facility was constructed.<ref>{{cite web |last=Johnson |first=Paul |url=http://www.wxii12.com/Fedex-Hub-Employment-Remains-Stuck-In-Neutral/-/9678472/4462130/-/s8t7f7/-/index.html |title=Fedex Hub Employment Remains Stuck In Neutral &#124; WXII Home – WXII Home |publisher=Wxii12.com |date=August 18, 2011 |access-date=January 9, 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130923161439/http://www.wxii12.com/Fedex-Hub-Employment-Remains-Stuck-In-Neutral/-/9678472/4462130/-/s8t7f7/-/index.html |archive-date=September 23, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://info.jctrans.com/jcnet/news/asn/20121111599217.shtml |title=FedEx's air cargo hub in Piedmont comes under fire as traffic declines-Air Shipping News-JCtrans |publisher=Info.jctrans.com |date=November 1, 2012 |access-date=January 9, 2017}}</ref>

In March 2015, [[HondaJet]], with a manufacturing facility in Greensboro, announced that it had received provisional type certification (PTC) from the United States [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA). This achievement indicates the FAA's approval of the HondaJet design based on certification testing, design reviews, and analyses completed to date.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150327005821/en/HondaJet-Receives-Provisional-Type-Certification-Federal-Aviation |title=The HondaJet Receives Provisional Type Certification from the Federal Aviation Administration |publisher=businesswire.com |date=March 27, 2015 |access-date=January 9, 2017}}</ref>

In 2022, construction began on the [[Boom Technology|Boom Supersonic]] factory at the airport. The future site will be used as a final assembly line and test site for its supersonic passenger aircraft, [[Boom Overture|Overture]].

===Climate===
Like much of the [[southeastern United States]], Greensboro has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with four distinct seasons. Winters are short and generally cool, with a January daily average of {{convert|38.9|°F|1}}. On average, there are 75 nights per year that drop to or below freezing,{{efn|The normal window for freezing temperatures is November 2 thru April 4.}} and 4.3 days that fail to rise above freezing.<ref name = "NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)" />{{efn|Occasionally this never occurs in an entire winter or even calendar year; the last such occurrence was the winter of 2011–12 and 2012, respectively.}} Measurable snowfall occurs nearly every winter, and accumulates to {{convert|7.5|in|cm|1}} on average, usually in January and February and occasionally December and March; the amount varies considerably from winter to winter.{{efn|Seasonal snowfall accumulation has ranged from {{convert|32.5|in|cm|1|abbr=on}} in the winter of 1926–27 to zero in the following winter (1927–28). A trace of snow was recorded as recently as the winter of 1991–92.}} [[Cold-air damming]] (CAD) can facilitate [[freezing rain]], often making it a more pressing concern than snow. Summers are hot and humid, with a daily average in July of {{convert|78.5|°F|1}}. On average, 32 days per year have highs at or above {{convert|90|°F|0}}, but, as in much of the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] South, {{convert|100|°F|0}}+ readings are uncommon.<ref name = "NWS Raleigh, NC (RAH)"/> Autumn is similar to spring in temperature but has fewer days of rainfall and less total rainfall. Extremes in temperature have ranged from {{convert|-8|°F|0}} on [[Winter 1985 cold wave|January 21, 1985]], to {{convert|104|°F|0}}, on June 12, 1911, June 12, 1914, and July 17, 1914.

Thunderstorms are common during the humid spring and summer months, some severe. On April 2, 1936, around 7:00 pm, a large, F-4 tornado cut a seven-mile (11-km) swath of destruction through southern Greensboro. 14 people were killed and 144 injured by the tornado, which moved through part of downtown. The storm was part of the [[1936 Cordele-Greensboro tornado outbreak]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://greensboro.com/news/tornado-of-1936-spawned-death-destruction-in-south-greensboro/article_59170117-9c34-59ce-b8fa-7070030dbca1.amp.html|title=Tornado of 1936 spawned death in south Greensboro|last=Moffett|first=Margaret|date=April 2, 2016|website=[[Greensboro News & Record]]|access-date=November 3, 2021}}</ref> Strong tornadoes have struck the Greensboro area since then, notably [[Stoneville, North Carolina|Stoneville]] on [[1998 Gainesville–Stoneville tornado outbreak|March 20, 1998]]; [[Clemmons, North Carolina|Clemmons]] and [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]] on [[May 1989 tornado outbreak|May 5, 1989]]; [[Clemmons, North Carolina|Clemmons]] and Greensboro on [[Tornado outbreak sequence of May 7–11, 2008|May 7, 2008]];<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/news/ten-years-ago-tornadoes-hit-clemmons-and-greensboro/83-550187033|title=Ten Years Ago: Tornadoes Hit Clemmons & Greensboro|last=Buckley|first=Tim|website=WFMYnews2.com|date=May 8, 2018 |access-date=May 8, 2018}}</ref> High Point on [[Tornado outbreak of March 28–29, 2010|March 28, 2010]]; and Greensboro on [[April 2018 North American storm complex|April 15, 2018]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wfmynews2.com/article/news/local/powerful-before-and-after-photos-of-greensboro-tornado/83-f9668571-d07b-4eec-a7dd-51a7eabe3804|title=Powerful Before and After photos from the 2018 Greensboro Tornado|last=2 News WFMY|first=Digital|date=April 14, 2019|website=WFMYnews2.com|access-date=April 14, 2019}}</ref>
