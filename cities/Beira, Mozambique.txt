'''Beira''' ({{IPA|pt|ˈbejɾɐ}}) is the capital and largest [[List of cities in Mozambique|city]] of [[Sofala Province]], in the central region of [[Mozambique]].<ref name="brit" /> 

Beira is where the [[Pungwe River]] meets the [[Indian Ocean]]. It is the fourth-largest city by population in Mozambique, after [[Maputo]], [[Matola]] and [[Nampula]]. Beira had a population of 397,368 in 1997, which grew to 530,604 in 2019. A coastal city, it holds the regionally significant [[Port of Beira]], which acts as a gateway for both the central interior portion of the country as well as the land-locked nations of [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]] and [[Malawi]].

Originally called '''Chiveve''' after a local river, it was renamed Beira to honour the [[Portuguese Crown]] prince Dom [[Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Luís Filipe]] (titled [[Prince of Beira]], itself referring to the traditional Portuguese province of [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira]]), who had visited Mozambique in the early 19th century. It was first developed by the Portuguese [[Mozambique Company]] in the 19th century, supplanting [[Sofala]] as the country's main port. It was then directly developed by the Portuguese colonial government from 1947 until Mozambique gained its independence from Portugal in 1975. Beira is the second largest seaport for international cargo transportation to Mozambique after [[Maputo]]. In March 2019, the city was heavily damaged by [[Cyclone Idai]],<ref name=":0">{{cite news |last1=Onishi |first1=Norimitsu |title=Large City in Mozambique Nearly Wiped Out as Cyclone Leaves Vast Destruction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/world/africa/flooding-death-toll-mozambique.html |work=New York Times |date=18 March 2019 |access-date=19 March 2019 |archive-date=19 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190319135909/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/world/africa/flooding-death-toll-mozambique.html |url-status=live }}</ref> destroying up to 90% of the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/mozambique-beira-buckles-brunt-cylcone-idai-190406153738447.html|title=Mozambique's Beira buckles as it bears the brunt of Cyclone Idai|website=www.aljazeera.com|access-date=2019-06-14|archive-date=2019-06-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190614224558/https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/04/mozambique-beira-buckles-brunt-cylcone-idai-190406153738447.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography==
Beira is located on the [[Mozambique Channel]], an [[arm (geography)|arm]] of the [[Indian Ocean]] located between [[Madagascar]] and [[Mozambique]]. The city sits north of the mouth of the convergence of two major rivers of Mozambique: the [[Buzi River (Mozambique)|Buzi River]] and the [[Pungwe River]]. The Buzi crosses {{Convert|250|km|mi}} across [[Manica Province|Manica]] and [[Sofala Province|Sofala]] provinces to form a wide [[estuary]]. The Pungwe crosses {{Convert|400|km|mi}} from the [[Eastern Highlands]] of Zimbabwe also through Manica and Sofala provinces to Beira.<ref name="brit"/>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Beira, Mozambique}}
[[File:Beira-c1905.jpg|thumb|200px|left|View of Rua Conselheiro Ennes, Beira, c. 1905]]
The city was established in 1890 by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and soon supplanted [[Sofala]] as the main port in the Portuguese-administered territory. Originally called Chiveve, after a local river, it was renamed to honor the [[Portuguese Crown]] prince Dom [[Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Luís Filipe]] who, in 1907, was the first member of the Portuguese royal family to visit Mozambique. Traditionally the Portuguese Crown prince carried the title of [[Prince of Beira]], a [[Beira (Portugal)|historical province]] of [[mainland Portugal]].

The Portuguese built the port and a railway to [[Rhodesia]], Portuguese families settled in the newly founded locality and started to develop commercial activities. With the growth of the village, in 1907 the Portuguese Crown elevated Beira to the status of city (''cidade''). Headquarters of the ''Companhia de Moçambique'' ([[Mozambique Company]]) from 1891,{{sfn|Derman|Kaarhus|2013|p=42}} the city's administration passed from the trading company to the Portuguese government in 1942.<ref>Britannica [https://www.britannica.com/place/Beira-Mozambique Beira] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190610222348/https://www.britannica.com/place/Beira-Mozambique |date=2019-06-10 }}, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref>

In 1966, the construction of a new railway station was completed. Before Mozambique's independence from Portugal, as a city of [[Portuguese Mozambique]], Beira was noted for its well-equipped [[seaport]], one of the major facilities of its kind in all [[East Africa]], [[tourism]], [[fishing]] and [[trade]]. The city prospered as a cosmopolitan port with different ethnic communities (Portuguese, Indian, Chinese, Bantus such as the [[Sena people|Sena]] and [[Ndau people|Ndau]]) employed in administration, commerce, and industry.

A large English-speaking population was the result of being a favourite holiday destination for [[Whites in Zimbabwe|white Rhodesians]]. One reminder of this is the [[Grande Hotel Beira|Grande Hotel]], built by the Portuguese, near the shore of the [[Indian Ocean]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwNCk59J5Ig |title=Cidade da Beira (Moçambique). |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-12-28 |access-date=2013-11-22 |archive-date=2014-05-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521204243/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwNCk59J5Ig |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9LR1FYj4m0 |title=Beira-Centenário-O Meu Tributo |publisher=YouTube |date=2007-08-19 |access-date=2013-11-22 |archive-date=2021-03-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210301040427/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9LR1FYj4m0 |url-status=live }}</ref> By 1970, the city of Beira had 113,770 inhabitants.

===Independence===
[[File:Conselho Municipal da Beira, Moçambique.jpg|thumb|Townhall of Beira]]
After independence from Portugal in 1975, many white ethnic Portuguese left the city. Mozambique was ravaged by a [[Mozambican Civil War|civil war]] from 1977 to 1992, opposing [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[FRELIMO]], which controlled the government, to the rebels of [[RENAMO]], descending to near total chaos in a couple of years. The famine, disease and poverty-stricken country collapsed. In Beira, the famous [[Grande Hotel Beira|Grande Hotel]] was occupied by around 1,000 homeless Beirans, and by the end of the civil war it was in near-ruins.

The [[2000 Mozambique flood]] devastated Beira and the surrounding region, leaving millions homeless and severely damaging the local economy.

During the campaign for the local elections in 2013, which culminated in the victory of the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) in the municipality, the '''[[Munhava]]''' district was the scene of violent clashes between police and supporters of the MDM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Mundo/Palops/Interior.aspx?content_id=3537026|title=População invadiu sede da Frelimo na Beira e queimou carro de dirigente|website=JN|access-date=2016-03-24|archive-date=2016-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175415/http://www.jn.pt/PaginaInicial/Mundo/Palops/Interior.aspx?content_id=3537026|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.eleicoes.org.mz/pt/2013/news/424/Munhava-a-balas-e-g%25C3%25A1s.htm |title=Munhava a balas e gás {{!}} @Verdade |date=2015-04-09 |access-date=2016-03-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150409153515/http://www.eleicoes.org.mz/pt/2013/news/424/Munhava-a-balas-e-g%C3%A1s.htm |archive-date=April 9, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

In 2019, [[Cyclone Idai]] caused extreme devastation in Beira.<ref name=":0" /> It struck the city on March 14, 2019, with winds of up to 177&nbsp;km/h (106&nbsp;mph), and caused flooding up to six meters deep across Mozambique.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47624156|title=Cyclone Idai triggers 'massive disaster'|date=2019-03-19|access-date=2019-03-19|language=en-GB|archive-date=2021-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210301040344/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-47624156|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Climate ==
Beira features a [[tropical savanna climate]] (Köppen [[Köppen climate classification|Aw]]). Average temperature in January is {{convert|27.6|°C|0|abbr=on}} and in July (the coldest month) it's {{convert|20.3|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The rainy season runs roughly from November to April.

== Water and Sanitation ==
Access to drinking water and sanitation in Mozambique was historically a major problem, alike many of the sub-Saharan African nations. It has been estimated that in developing countries, around 80% of all disease arises as a direct result of inadequate sanitation, poor hygiene, and contaminated water.

According to the United Nations Environment Programme, each day around six thousand people die from diseases caused by poor sanitation, while another 300 million Africans have no access to clean water.

For Mozambique in 1992, around a fifth of the country's households had access to potable water and the situation for wastewater provision was even worse. This was a serious public health issue in an area where cholera, dysentery and other water-borne diseases are endemic.

With the inauguration of the new water treatment plant at Mutua in May 2007, an important milestone was passed in Mozambique's ambitious drive towards improving its provision of potable water and sanitation.

Doubling the supply of water to the cities of Beira and Dondo, the plant was opened by the country's President Armando Emílio Guebuza the day after he formally launched the next stage of the project to deal with Beira's sewage. Construction of the Beira treatment plant was carried out during a period of 30 months and was completed in June 2012.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Beira Dondo Water and Sanitation Projects, Mozambique - Water Technology |url=https://www.water-technology.net/projects/bieradondo/ |access-date=2022-08-02 |website=www.water-technology.net}}</ref>

This latest part of the scheme consists of rehabilitating the existing sanitation network, together with the construction of a number of new system elements to extend and upgrade the sewers, wastewater treatment facilities and a drainage system.

The new water plant cost €5.6m, while the Beira sanitation system cost €62.65m, with the EU providing €52.95m, and the remaining €9.7m provided by the Mozambique Government.

==Transportation==

[[File:Beira Airport DF-SD-01-01511.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Beira Airport]]
Beira has long been a major trade point for exports coming in and out of Zimbabwe, Malawi, Zambia and other Southern African nations. Because of this, the [[port of Beira]] is the second largest in Mozambique.

The importance of the port was shown during the Mozambique Civil War, when Zimbabwean troops protected the [[Beira–Bulawayo railway]] and [[Beira–Lobito Highway|Beira to Mutare highway]] in order to continue trade.  The railway to Zimbabwe was originally {{RailGauge|610mm}} in 1890, but was converted to {{RailGauge|1067mm}} in 1900.
