'''Buffalo''' is a [[Administrative divisions of New York (state)|city]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] and the [[county seat]] of [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]]. It lies in [[Western New York]] at the eastern end of [[Lake Erie]], at the head of the [[Niagara River]] on the [[Canada–United States border]]. With a population of 278,349 according to the 2020 census, Buffalo is the [[List of municipalities in New York|second-most populous city]] in New York state after [[New York City]], and the [[List of United States cities by population|81st-most populous city]] in the U.S.<ref name="USCensusEst2020">{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/buffalocitynewyork/POP010220 |title=QuickFacts: Buffalo city, New York |access-date=2021-08-17}}</ref> Buffalo and the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York|Niagara Falls]] together make up the two-county [[Buffalo–Niagara Falls metropolitan area]], which had an estimated population of 1.2 million in 2020, making it the [[List of metropolitan statistical areas|49th-largest metro area]] in the U.S.

Before the 17th century, the region was inhabited by nomadic [[Paleo-Indians]] who were succeeded by the [[Neutral Confederacy|Neutral]], [[Erie people|Erie]], and [[Iroquois]] nations. In the early 17th century, the French began to explore the region. In the 18th century, Iroquois land surrounding [[Buffalo River (New York)|Buffalo Creek]] was ceded through the [[Holland Land Purchase]], and a small village was established at its headwaters. In 1825, after its harbor was improved, Buffalo was selected as the terminus of the [[Erie Canal]], which led to its incorporation in 1832. The canal stimulated its growth as the primary [[inland port]] between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. [[Transshipment]] made Buffalo the world's largest [[grain trade|grain port]] of that era. After the coming of railroads greatly reduced the canal's importance, the city became the second-largest railway hub (after [[Chicago]]). During the mid-19th century, Buffalo transitioned to manufacturing, which came to be dominated by steel production. Later, [[deindustrialization]] and the opening of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] saw the city's economy decline and diversify. It developed its [[service industries]], such as health care, retail, tourism, logistics, and education, while retaining some manufacturing. In 2019, the [[gross domestic product]] of the Buffalo–Niagara Falls MSA was $53 billion (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=53000000000|start_year=2019}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}).

The city's cultural landmarks include the [[Parks and recreation in Buffalo, New York|oldest urban parks system]] in the United States, the [[Buffalo AKG Art Museum]], the [[Buffalo History Museum]], the [[Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra]], [[Shea's Performing Arts Center]], the [[Buffalo Museum of Science]], and several [[list of festivals in Buffalo, New York|annual festivals]]. Its educational institutions include the [[University at Buffalo]], [[Buffalo State University]], [[Canisius University]], and [[D'Youville University]]. Buffalo is also known for its [[Lake-effect snow|winter weather]], [[Buffalo wing]]s, and three major-league [[Sports in Buffalo|sports teams]]: the National Football League's [[Buffalo Bills]], the National Hockey League's [[Buffalo Sabres]] and the National Lacrosse League's [[Buffalo Bandits]].

Before the [[European colonization of the Americas|arrival of Europeans]], nomadic [[Paleo-Indians]] inhabited the [[western New York]] region from the [[Lithic stage|8th millennium BCE]]. The [[Woodland period]] began around 1000 BC, marked by the rise of the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy]] and the spread of its tribes throughout the state.<ref name = "Thompson1977 113-120">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/geographyofnewyo00thom |url-access=registration |title=Geography of New York State |last=Thompson |first=John H. |publisher=[[Syracuse University Press]] |year=1977 |isbn=9780815621829 |pages=113–120 |chapter=The Indian |location=Syracuse, N.Y. |lccn=77004337 |oclc=2874807}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Ritchie |first1=William A. |title=The Archaeology of New York State |date=19 February 2014 |publisher=[[Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group]] |isbn=978-0-307-82049-5 |chapter=The Woodland Stage—Development of Ceramics, Agriculture and Village Life}}</ref> Seventeenth-century [[Jesuit missionaries]] were the first Europeans to visit the area.<ref name="Rundell1962 57-96" />

During [[French colonization of the Americas|French exploration of the region]] in 1620, the region was sparsely populated and occupied by the [[Agrarian society|agrarian]] [[Erie people]] in the south and the [[Neutral Nation]] in the north, with a relatively small tribe, the [[Wenrohronon]], between and the [[Seneca people|Senecas]], an Iroquois tribe, occupying the land just east of the region.<ref name = "Thompson1977 113-120"/> The Neutral grew tobacco and [[hemp]] to trade with the Iroquois, who [[North American fur trade|traded furs]] with the French for European goods.<ref name = "Thompson1977 113-120" /> The tribes used animal- and war paths to travel and move goods across what today is New York State. (Centuries later, these same paths were gradually improved, then paved, then developed into major modern roads.)<ref name = "Thompson1977 113-120"/> Traditional Seneca oral legends, as recounted by professional storytellers known as Hagéotâ, were highly participatory. These tales were told only during winter, as they were believed to have the power to put even animals and plants to sleep, which could affect the harvest. At the conclusion, audience members typically offered gifts, such as tobacco, to the storyteller as a sign of appreciation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Seneca Folk Tales {{!}} Early Americas Digital Archive (EADA) |url=https://eada.lib.umd.edu/text-entries/seneca-folk-tales/ |access-date=2024-10-07 |website=eada.lib.umd.edu}}</ref> During the [[Beaver Wars]] in the mid-17th century the Senecas conquered the Erie and Neutrals in the region.<ref>{{Cite journal |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/20086480 |title=The Indians of the Past and of the Present |journal=[[Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography]] |volume=46 |issue=3 |last=Donehoo |first=George P. |year=1922 |pages=177–198 |jstor=20086480 |access-date=June 11, 2021 |archive-date=June 11, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210611202413/https://www.jstor.org/stable/20086480 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="Seneca">{{Cite journal |doi=10.1525/aa.1927.29.2.02a00050 |title=The Migrations of the Seneca Nation |last=Houghton |first=Frederick |date=1927 |journal=[[American Anthropologist]] |pages=241–250 |volume=29 |issue=2 |doi-access = free|issn=0002-7294}}</ref><ref name="AmHeritageBk">{{cite encyclopedia |year=1961 |title=The American Heritage Book of Indians |editor=Alvin M.
