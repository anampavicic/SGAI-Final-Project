[[File:ISS-46 Suez Canal, Port Said, Egypt.jpg|thumb|400px|Port Said, [[Port Fuad]] and [[Suez Canal]]]]

'''Port Said''' ({{lang-arz|بورسعيد|Bōrsaʿīd}}, {{IPA|arz|boɾsæˈʕiːd, poɾ-|pron}}) is a port city that lies in the northeast [[Egypt]] extending about {{cvt|30|km|mi}} along the coast of the [[Mediterranean Sea]], straddling the west bank of the northern mouth of the [[Suez Canal]]. The city is the [[capital city|capital]] of the [[Port Said Governorate|Port Said governorate]] and it forms the majority of the governorate, where its seven districts comprise seven of the governorate's eight regions.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=About - Administrative Division |url=https://portsaid.gov.eg/StaticContent/1 |access-date=2024-01-03 |website=portsaid.gov.eg}}</ref> At the beginning of 2023 had a population of 680,375 people.<ref name=":1" />

The city was established in 1859 during the building of the Suez Canal. There are numerous old houses with grand balconies on all floors, giving the city a distinctive look. Port Said's twin city is [[Port Fuad]], which lies on the eastern bank of the Suez Canal. The two cities coexist, to the extent that there is hardly any town centre in Port Fuad. The cities are connected by free [[Ferry|ferries]] running all through the day, and together they form a [[metropolitan area]] with over a million residents that extends both on the [[Africa|African]] and the [[Asia|Asian]] sides of the Suez Canal. 

Port Said acted as a [[global city]] since its establishment and flourished particularly during the nineteenth and the first half of the twentieth century when it was inhabited by various nationalities and religions. Most of them were from Mediterranean countries, and they coexisted in tolerance, forming a [[wikt:cosmopolitan|cosmopolitan]] community. Referring to this fact [[Rudyard Kipling]] once said "If you truly wish to find someone you have known and who travels, there are two points on the globe you have but to sit and wait, sooner or later your man will come there: the docks of [[London]] and Port Said".<ref name="ReferenceA">Port-Saïd : Architectures XIXe-XXe siècles</ref> Port Said is an important city in Egypt for trade and business, due to its location on the coastal region

==Name==
{{anchor|Etymology}}
The name of Port Said first appeared in 1855. It was chosen by an international committee composed of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], [[Second French Empire|France]], the [[Russian Empire]], [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], [[Spain]] and [[Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont|Piedmont]]. It is a compound name which composed of two parts: the French word [[:wikt:port#French|port]] (marine harbour) and [[Sa'id of Egypt|Said]] (the name of the ruler of Egypt at that time), who granted [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] the concession to dig the Suez Canal.<ref name=Bowen1886>{{Cite journal |last=Bowen|first=John Eliot |date=1886 |title=The Conflict of East and West in Egypt |url=https://archive.org/download/conflictofeastwe00bowerich/conflictofeastwe00bowerich_bw.pdf |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=1|issue=2|pages=295–335 |doi=10.2307/2138972 |jstor=2138972}}</ref> Urbanized residents pronounce the name {{IPA|arz|boɾsæˈʕiːd|}} or {{IPA|arz|poɾsæˈʕiːd|}}, while unurbanized residents pronounce it {{IPA|und|bɔɾsaˈʕɛˑd||cat=no}}.

In [[Ancient Greek]], the city was called {{lang|grc|Πηλούσιον}} ({{transl|grc|Pēloúsion}}).

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Port Said}}
===Founding (1859) ===
[[File:PORT-SAÏD -- De Lesseps monument (n.d.) - front - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand de Lesseps monument on the tourist jetty|left]]

[[File:Port Said, The Office of the Suez Canal Company (n.d.) - front - TIMEA.jpg|thumb|250px|The office of the Suez Canal Company in Port Said built in 1893|left]]
Port Said was founded by [[Sa'id of Egypt]] on Easter Monday, April 25, 1859, when [[Ferdinand de Lesseps]] gave the first symbolic swing of the pickaxe to signal the beginning of construction. The first problem encountered was the difficulty for ships to drop anchor nearby. Luckily, a single rocky outcrop flush with the shoreline was discovered a few hundred meters away. Equipped with a wooden wharf, it served as a mooring berth for the boats. Soon after, a wooden [[jetty]] was built, connecting the departure islet, as it quickly became known, to the beach. This rock could be considered the heart of the developing city, and it was on this highly symbolic site, forty years later, that a monument to de Lesseps was erected.<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

There were no local resources here. Everything Port Said needed had to be imported: wood, stone, supplies, machinery, equipment, housing, food and even water. Giant water storage containers were erected to supply fresh water until the [[Sweet Water Canal]] could be completed. One of the most pressing problems was the lack of stone. Early buildings were often imported in kit form and made great use of wood. A newly developed technique was used to construct the jetties called conglomerate concrete or "Beton Coignet", which was named after its inventor François Coignet. Blocks of concrete were sunk into the sea to be the foundations of the jetties. Still more innovative was the use of the same concrete for the [[lighthouse of Port Said]], the only original building still standing in Port Said.
In 1859 the first 150 laborers camped in tents around a wooden shed. A year later, the number of inhabitants had risen to 2000 — with the European contingent housed in wooden bungalows imported from northern Europe. By 1869, when the canal opened, the permanent population had reached 10,000. The European district, clustered around the waterfront, was separated from the Arab district, Gemalia, {{cvt|400|m|ft|sp=us}} to the west, by a wide strip of sandy beach where a tongue of [[Lake Manzala]] reached towards the sea. This inlet soon dried out and was replaced by buildings; over time there was no division between the European and Arab quarters.

Since its establishment, Port Said played a significant role in Egyptian history. The British entered Egypt through the city in 1882, starting their occupation of Egypt. 

===Thriving international port and city (1902–1945) ===
[[File:Map of Port Said (Baedeker, 1914).jpg|thumb|left|French map of Port Said, c. 1914]]
At the start of the twentieth century, two things happened to change Port Said: in 1902, Egyptian cotton from [[El Matareya, Dakahlia|Mataria]] started to be exported via Port Said; and in 1904 a standard gauge railway opened to [[Cairo]]. The result was to attract a large commercial community and to raise its social status. In particular a sizable Greek community grew up. In 1907, the quickly growing city had about 50,000 inhabitants, among whom were 11,000 Europeans "of all nations".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Baedeker |first1=Karl |title=Indien. Handbuch für Reisende |date=1914 |publisher=Karl Baedeker |location=Leipzig |page=5 |language=de |quote=Die rasch anwachsende Zahl der Bewohner belief sich 1907 auf 50 000, darunter fast 11 000 Europäer aller Nationen, im übrigens Araber, Berber, Neger in buntem Gemisch.}}</ref> During the First World War, Port Said became home to an important Allied hospital.<ref>Leeds, ''West Yorkshire Archive Service,''Letter from Cornforth to Leeds Town Clerk Mitchell, 9 December 1918.</ref> Due to the strategic location of Port Said intersecting Europe, Africa and Asia, thousands of men were sent to this hospital. This included soldiers wounded as a result from the Gallipoli campaign in 1915. Following the end of the [[World War I]], the directors of the Suez Canal Company decided to create a new city on the Asian bank, building 300 houses for its labourers and functionaries. Port Fouad was designed by the [[École des Beaux-Arts]] in [[Paris]]. The houses follow the French model. The new city was founded in December 1926.

Since its foundation people of all nationalities and religions had been moving to the city and each community brought in its own customs, cuisine, religion and architecture. By the late 1920s the population numbered over 100,000 people. In the 1930s for example there were elegant public buildings designed by Italian architects. The old Arab Quarter was swallowed up into the thriving city.<ref name="myportsaid.info">{{cite web |url=http://www.myportsaid.info/Brief%20History%20of%20PS.html |title=Brief History of Port Said |access-date=2011-01-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721225230/http://www.myportsaid.info/Brief%20History%20of%20PS.html |archive-date=2011-07-21}}</ref> Port Said by now was a thriving, bustling international port with a multi-national population: Jewish merchants, Egyptian shopkeepers, Greek photographers, Italian architects, Swiss hoteliers, Maltese administrators, Scottish engineers, French bankers and diplomats from all around the world. All lived and worked alongside the large local Egyptian community. And always passing through were international travelers to and from Africa, India and the Far East. Intermarriage between French, Italian and Maltese was particularly common, resulting in a local Latin and Catholic community like those of Alexandria and Cairo. French was the common language of the European and non-Arab population, and often the first language of children born to parents from different communities. Italian was also widely spoken and was the mother tongue of part of the Maltese community, since the ancestors of the latter had come to Egypt before the Anglicization of Malta in the 1920s. Multilingualism was a characteristic of the foreign population of Port Said, with most people continuing to speak community languages as well as the common French.

In 1936 a treaty was signed between the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Egypt called the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]]. It stipulated the British pledge to withdraw all their troops from Egypt, except those necessary to protect the Suez Canal and its surroundings. 
[[File:Admiralty Chart No 234 Port Said, Published 1966.jpg|thumb|left|Admiralty Chart of Port Said, Published 1966]]

=== Revolution, end of British occupation (1946–present) ===
Following [[World War II]], Egypt denounced the [[Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936]], leading to skirmishes with British troops guarding the [[Suez Canal]] in 1951.

The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]] occurred. Then on 26 July 1956, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] nationalised the Suez Canal Company. The nationalisation escalated tensions with Britain and France, who colluded with Israel to invade Egypt, the invasion known in Egypt as the tripartite aggression or the [[Suez Crisis]]. On 6 November 1956, British troops [[Timeline of the Suez Crisis#Royal Marines come ashore at Port Said|violently landed in Port Said]] while firing on the Egyptian military. Port Said next was bombed by the British, to terrorise the civilians, of whom hundreds died. There was also heavy fighting in the streets with again many civilian casualties, and the resulting fires destroyed much of the city.

The withdrawal of the last soldier of foreign troops was on 23 December 1956.<ref>{{cite news |title=On This Day: 1956: Jubilation as allied troops leave Suez |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/23/newsid_3294000/3294305.stm |access-date=18 October 2016 |agency=BBC |date=December 23, 1956 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226115923/http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/23/newsid_3294000/3294305.stm |archive-date=26 December 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> Since then, this day was chosen as Port Said's national day. It is widely celebrated annually in Port Said. The French-speaking European community had begun to emigrate to Europe, Australia, South Africa and elsewhere in 1946 and most of the remainder left Egypt in the wake of the Suez Crisis, paralleling the contemporary exodus of French-speaking Europeans from Tunisia. Most of the Greek community was also expelled or left the town under the rule of Gamal Abdel Nasser.<ref>A Presence without a Narrative: The Greeks in Egypt, 1961-1976 https://journals.openedition.org/remmm/12117?lang=en {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220201034814/https://journals.openedition.org/remmm/12117?lang=en |date=1 February 2022 }}</ref>

After the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, also called the [[Six-Day War]], the Suez Canal was closed by an Egyptian blockade until 5 June 1975, and the residents of Port Said were evacuated by the Egyptian government to prepare for the [[Yom Kippur War]] (1973).
The city was re-inhabited after the war and the reopening of the Canal. In 1976, Port Said was declared a duty-free port, attracting people from all over Egypt. Now the population of the city is 794,720.<ref>Port Said Main Features https://www.portsaid.gov.eg/StaticContent/1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241026034814/https://www.portsaid.gov.eg/StaticContent/1 |date=26 October 2024 }}</ref>

==Economy==

Port Said has been ranked the second among the Egyptian cities according to the [[Human Development Index]] in 2009 and 2010;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rosaonline.net/Daily/News.asp?id=36636 |title=Consejos para la vida – |access-date=December 23, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002181958/http://www.rosaonline.net/Daily/News.asp?id=36636 |archive-date=2 October 2011}}</ref> the economic base of the city is [[fishing]] and industries, like [[chemicals]], [[ultra-processed food]], and [[cigarettes]]. Port Said is also an important harbour for exports of Egyptian products like [[cotton]] and [[rice]], and additionally a fueling station for ships that pass through the Suez Canal. It thrives on being a [[duty-free]] port, as well as a tourist resort especially during summer.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.portsaid.gov.eg/tourism/default.aspx |title=الصفحة الرئيسية -السياحه |website=Portsaid.gov.eg |access-date=23 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161224030634/http://www.portsaid.gov.eg/tourism/default.aspx |archive-date=24 December 2016 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is home to the [[Lighthouse of Port Said]] (the first building in the world built from [[reinforced concrete]]).

Due to its excellent geographic location, Port Said is designed to attract logistics start ups along with import and export businesses.<ref>[https://www.listcompany.org/Port_Said_Near_Egypt.html Company List ›› List of Companies in Egypt ›› Companies in Port Said] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204115730/http://www.listcompany.org/Port_Said_Near_Egypt.html |date=4 February 2018 }} ''www.listcompany.org'', accessed 10 April 2021</ref>

In 2019, the city witnessed the construction of the New Suez Canal, led by the Egyptian President [[Abdel Fattah el-Sisi]].

==Geography==

===Climate===
Port Said has a [[hot desert climate]] (BWh) according to [[Köppen climate classification]], but blowing winds from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] greatly moderates the temperatures, typical to the [[northern coast of Egypt]], making its summers moderately hot and humid while its winters mild and moderately [[precipitation (meteorology)|wet]] when [[Ice pellets|sleet]] and [[hail]] are also common, yet less common than in [[Alexandria#Climate|Alexandria]] because Port Said is drier. January and February are the coolest months while the hottest are July and August.

The highest record temperature was {{cvt|44|C}}, recorded on June 20, 1988, while the lowest record temperature was {{cvt|0|C}}, recorded on December 25, 1979.<ref name="Voodoo Skies">{{cite web |title=Port Said/El Gamil, Egypt |url=http://voodooskies.com/weather/egypt/port-saidel-gamil/monthly/temperature |publisher=Voodoo Skies |access-date=29 October 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424195727/http://voodooskies.com/weather/egypt/port-saidel-gamil/monthly/temperature |archive-date=24 April 2015 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Port Said, [[al-Qusayr, Egypt#Climate|Kosseir]], [[Ras El Bar#Climate|Ras El Bar]], [[Baltim#Climate|Baltim]], [[Damietta#Climate|Damietta]] and Alexandria have the least temperature variation in [[climate of Egypt|Egypt]], additionally, [[Mersa Matruh#Climate|Mersa Matruh]] and Port Said have the coolest summer days of any other cities or resorts, although not significantly cooler than other northern coastal places.
