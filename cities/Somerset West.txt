== History ==
[[File:Somerset West 1909.jpg|thumb|left|Main Road Somerset West in 1909.]]
A cattle post was established here{{clarify|date=June 2022}} by Dutch soldiers in 1672.
 
A town developed around the Lourens River (originally "Tweederivier", which means "Second River"; "Eersterivier", meaning "First River" passes through [[Stellenbosch]], some {{cvt|16|km}} to the north) and the farm of [[Vergelegen]] (Dutch: "remotely situated"), an 18th-century farmhouse built in the historic [[Cape Dutch architecture|Cape Dutch style]] by [[Willem Adriaan van der Stel]], governor of the Cape and son of [[Simon van der Stel]], who gave his name to the nearby town of [[Stellenbosch]]. Willem Adriaan was later sent back to Holland after being charged with corruption and cruelty towards local Dutch farmers. The farm is now owned by a subsidiary of the large mining company [[Anglo American plc|Anglo American]], who have restored the farmhouse to its original magnificence and continue to produce some of South Africa's best wines there.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The farm is open to tourists.

Somerset West was founded in 1822 on part of the historic farm, Vergelegen.<ref name="Olivier2005">{{cite book|author=Sandra Olivier|title=Touring in South Africa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=urN9XqmQ_RUC&pg=PA30|access-date=2013-09-20|year=2005|publisher=Struik|isbn=978-1-77007-142-1|page=30}}</ref> The town was named Somerset after a British governor of the [[Cape Colony]] during the 1800s, [[Lord Charles Somerset]], with the suffix 'West' being added after 1825 to differentiate it from [[Somerset East]], another South African town in the Eastern Cape. In the 1830s, [[Sir Lowry's Pass]], named after later governor [[Sir Lowry Cole]], was constructed to link the town with outposts further east over the [[Hottentots-Holland]] mountains.

In the 1960s, the [[AECI]] factory between Somerset West and [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] was the second largest dynamite factory in the world.{{cn|date=June 2022}}

In recent years{{when?|date=June 2022}} many guest houses and B&Bs have opened up in Somerset West, since it is conveniently located for [[Cape Town]] ({{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=}} away on the [[N2 (South Africa)|N2 motorway]]), the beaches at the [[Strand, Western Cape|Strand]] and [[Gordon's Bay]], and the Western Cape's numerous wine farms.

==Growth==
In recent years, there has been a population boom in Somerset West with various secure or gated estates such as Sitari Country Estate, Croydon Vineyard and Olive Estates and Kelderhof Country Village being built on previously undeveloped land west of the town, gradually closing the little break isolating Somerset West from the rest of the metropolitan area. Paardevlei, south of the town, is an emerging [[mixed-use development]] comprising gated residential complexes and the Busamed Paardevlei Private Hospital.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sitari Country Estate {{!}} Live in the Helderberg's Most Iconic Estate |url=https://sitari.co.za/ |access-date=2022-06-16 |website=Sitari Country Estate |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Kelderhof Country Village {{!}} Home |url=https://www.kelderhof.co.za/ |access-date=2022-06-16 |website=www.kelderhof.co.za}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=WELCOME |url=https://www.croydonvineyardestate.com/ |access-date=2022-06-16 |website=CroYdon Vineyard Estate |language=en-ZA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Busamed Paardevlei Private Hospital |url=https://www.busamed.co.za/paardevlei/ |access-date=2022-06-16 |website=Busamed Paardevlei Private Hospital |language=en-US}}</ref>

==Coats of arms==
'''Municipality (1)''' — Somerset West was a municipality in its own right from 1904 to 1996.  The council approved its first coat of arms on 23 April 1935.<ref name=wca>Western Cape Archives : Somerset West Municipal Minutes (23 April 1935).</ref>
:
'''Municipality (2)''' — In 1953, the council approved a new design, by [[Ivan Mitford-Barberton]] and [[H. Ellis Tomlinson]].  This was in response to a Cape Provincial Administration circular calling on municipalities to have their arms checked and, if necessary, re-designed to make them heraldically correct.  The arms were granted by the [[College of Arms]] on 25 November 1953.  They were registered at the [[Bureau of Heraldry]] in June 1994.<ref name=boh>[http://www.national.archsrch.gov.za/sm300cv/smws/sm300dl National Archives of South Africa : Data of the Bureau of Heraldry]</ref>

The arms were: ''Azure,  a  portcullis chained Or; on a chief of the last a setting sun Gules'' (i.e. a blue shield displaying a red setting sun on a golden stripe across the top, and a golden portcullis with chains below it).  The crest was a golden demi-lion holding a vine, issuing from a red mural crown charged with three golden rings.  The motto was ''Prorsum sursum''.  The design is canting: the portcullis comes from the Somerset family arms, and the setting sun denotes the west.
