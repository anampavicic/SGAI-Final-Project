Throughout its history, Rochester has acquired several nicknames based on local industries; it has been known as "[[History of Rochester, New York#Rochesterville and The Flour City|the Flour City]]" and "[[History of Rochester, New York#The Flower City|the Flower City]]" for its dual role in flour production and floriculture,<ref name=":1" /> and as the "Imaging Capital of the World" for its association with film, optics, and photography.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitrochester.com/see&do/photography-film/|title=Photography & Film|access-date=May 7, 2016|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151011213617/http://www.visitrochester.com/see%26do/photography-film/|archive-date=October 11, 2015}}</ref>

The city was one of the United States' first [[boomtown]]s, initially due to the fertile [[Genesee River]] valley which gave rise to numerous flour mills, and then as a manufacturing center, which spurred further rapid population growth.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QZO8LAAACAAJ|title=America's First Boomtown - Rochester, NY: The Early Years and the Notables Who Shaped It|last1=Publications|first1=Rochester History Alive|last2=Kling|first2=Warren|date=April 1, 2008|publisher=Rochester History Alive Publications|isbn=9780981510705|access-date=June 3, 2020|archive-date=August 19, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819204239/https://books.google.com/books?id=QZO8LAAACAAJ|url-status=live}}</ref> Rochester has also played a key part in US history as a hub for social and political movements, especially [[abolitionism]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Abolition - Freethought Trail - New York|url=https://freethought-trail.org/causes/cause:abolition/|access-date=May 13, 2021|website=freethought-trail.org|archive-date=May 23, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200523042938/https://freethought-trail.org/causes/cause:abolition/|url-status=live}}</ref> and the [[Women's Suffrage in the United States|women's rights movement]].<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Rochester History |volume=X |date=July 1948 |issue=2 |url=https://www.libraryweb.org/~rochhist/v10_1948/v10i2-3.pdf |title=Woman's Rights in Rochester: A Century of Progress |first=Blake |last=McKelvey |access-date=June 29, 2020 |archive-date=February 27, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227034919/https://www.libraryweb.org/~rochhist/v10_1948/v10i2-3.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

Rochester is the birthplace and/or home of many notable companies including [[Eastman Kodak]], [[Xerox]], [[Bausch & Lomb]], [[Wegmans]], [[Gannett]], [[Paychex]], and [[Western Union]], and the region became a global center for science, technology, and research and development. This has been aided by the presence of several internationally renowned universities, notably the [[University of Rochester]] and [[Rochester Institute of Technology]], and their research programs; these schools, along with many other smaller colleges, have played an increasingly large role in its economy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://13wham.com/news/local/fisher-rit-u-of-r-named-among-best-universities-in-us|title=Fisher, RIT, U of R named among best universities in U.S.|date=September 10, 2018|website=13 WHAM News|publisher=[[WHAM-TV]]|access-date=February 28, 2020|archive-date=February 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200228214729/https://13wham.com/news/local/fisher-rit-u-of-r-named-among-best-universities-in-us|url-status=live}}</ref> The city experienced significant population decline due to [[deindustrialization]] in the late 20th century, although less severely than its [[Rust Belt]] peers.

==History==
{{Main|History of Rochester, New York}}

===Nineteenth century===
The [[Seneca people|Seneca]] tribe of the [[Iroquois Confederacy]] lived around Rochester prior to the [[American Revolution]], and used the area as a hunting ground.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McKelvey |first1=Blake |title=ROCHESTER THE WATER - POWER CITY 1812-1854 |date=1945 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |page=9 |url=https://archive.org/details/rochesterthewate000355mbp/page/n115/mode/2up |access-date=13 January 2024}}</ref> Allied with the British, the Seneca were forced to cede or sell most of their land in New York after the war. The area now occupied by Rochester was ceded in the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] of 1788. As a reward for their loyalty to the British crown, the Iroquois were given a large [[Haldimand Proclamation|land grant]] on the [[Grand River (Ontario)|Grand River]] in Canada.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Sam |first=Bleiweis |url=http://history.emory.edu/home/documents/endeavors/volume5/gunpowder-age-v-bleiweis.pdf |title=The Downfall of the Iroquois |publisher=[[Emory University]] |year=2013 |access-date=February 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200806170336/http://history.emory.edu/home/documents/endeavors/volume5/gunpowder-age-v-bleiweis.pdf |archive-date=August 6, 2020 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Catapano|first=Andrea Lucielle|url=https://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu/bitstream/handle/1951/44779/000000159.sbu.pdf?sequence=3|title=The Rising of the Ongwehònwe: Sovereignty, Identity, and Representation on the Six Nations Reserve|publisher=[[Stony Brook University]]|year=2007|access-date=February 28, 2020|archive-date=June 2, 2017|archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20170602062444/https://dspace.sunyconnect.suny.edu/bitstream/handle/1951/44779/000000159.sbu.pdf?sequence%3D3|url-status=live}}</ref>

Rochester was founded shortly after by a wave of English-Puritan-descended immigrants from [[New England]], who were looking for new agricultural land. They were the dominant cultural group in Rochester for over a century.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Peck |first=William F. |url=https://www.libraryweb.org/~digitized/books/History_of_Rochester_and_Monroe_County_volume_I.pdf |title=History of Rochester and Monroe County, New York, From the Earliest Historic Times to the Beginning of 1907 |publisher=The Pioneer Publishing Company |year=1908 |volume=I |location=New York and Chicago |pages=181}}</ref> On November 8, 1803, three men from [[Hagerstown, Maryland]], purchased a 100-acre (40-[[hectare|ha]]) tract from [[The Pulteney Association|the Pulteney Estate]] along the Genesee River: Major Charles Carroll, Colonel William Fitzhugh Jr, and Colonel [[Nathaniel Rochester]], the namesake of the city. They chose the site because its three [[Waterfall#Types of waterfalls|cataracts]] on the Genesee offered great potential for water power. Beginning in 1811, and with a population of 15, the three founders surveyed the land and laid out streets and tracts.<ref>Peck, pp. 32-35</ref> In 1817, the Brown brothers and other landowners joined their lands with the Hundred Acre Tract to form the village of Rochesterville.

By 1821, Rochesterville became the seat of Monroe County.<ref>Peck, p. 59</ref> In 1823, the [[Erie Canal]] aqueduct over the Genesee River was completed, connecting the city to the [[Hudson River]] to the east.<ref>Peck, p. 60</ref> New commerce from the canal turned the village into America's first [[boomtown]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=McKelvey |first1=Blake |title=ROCHESTER THE WATER - POWER CITY 1812-1854 |date=1945 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |page=99 |url=https://archive.org/details/rochesterthewate000355mbp/page/n115/mode/2up |access-date=13 January 2024}}</ref> By 1830, Rochester's population had grown to 9,200,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1850a-02.pdf|title=Census|publisher=United States Census|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100808210104/http://www2.census.gov/prod2/decennial/documents/1850a-02.pdf|archive-date=August 8, 2010}} page 36</ref> and in 1834, it was rechartered as a city.<ref>Peck, p. 68</ref> Rochester was first known as "the Young Lion of the West", and then as the "Flour City".

During the mid-19th century, as the center of the wheat-processing industry moved west with population and agriculture, the city became home to an expanding [[Plant nursery|nursery]] business, giving rise to the city's second nickname, the Flower City.

Rochester's landscape was formed by the [[ice sheet]]s during the [[Pleistocene]] epoch. The retreating ice sheets reached a standstill at what is now the southern border of the city, melting at the same rate as they were advancing, depositing sediment along the southern edge of the ice mass. This created a line of hills, including (from west to east) Mt. Hope, the hills of Highland Park, Pinnacle Hill, and Cobb's Hill. Because the sediment of these hills was deposited into a proglacial lake, they are stratified and classified as a "[[Kame|kame delta]]". A brief retreat and readvance of the ice sheet onto the delta deposited unstratified material there, creating a rare hybrid structure called "[[Moraine|kame moraine]]".<ref>{{Cite news|last=Broad|first=William J.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/science/how-the-ice-age-shaped-new-york.html|title=How the Ice Age Shaped New York|date=June 5, 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 5, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=May 8, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190508055054/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/05/science/how-the-ice-age-shaped-new-york.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite journal|last=Fairchild|first=H.

By the early 1820s, however, the area was overshadowed by developments in the north that would become downtown Rochester. Due to a tumultuous bend in the Genesee, the area was home to skilled boatsmen who assisted boats traveling north to Rochester and the area was consequently known during this time as "The Rapids".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg-Naparsteck |first1=Ruth |title=At the Rapids on the Genesee Settlement at Castletown |journal=Rochester History |date=Summer 1992 |volume=LIV |issue=3 |page=3 |url=https://www.libraryweb.org/~rochhist/v54_1992/v54i3.pdf |access-date=31 December 2023}}</ref> In the 1890s, as Rochester expanded, the area rapidly urbanized. By 1930, it was a booming residential area for doctors, lawyers, and other skilled workers. Homes in the originally upper-class neighborhood typically have gumwood trim, leaded glass, fireplaces, hardwood floors, and open porches. In the 1960s, property values fell as the population of Rochester did, the area experienced [[white flight]] accelerated by school busing, [[blockbusting]], and [[List of ethnic riots|race riot]]s downtown, and crime increased, with violence, [[Substance abuse|drug use]], and neglected property further diminishing property values.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Leavy |first1=Michael |title=Rochester's 19th Ward |last2=Leavy |first2=Glenn |publisher=Arcadia Publishing |year=2005 |isbn=978-0738539478}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=December 2023}} In recent years, neighborhood revitalization has come from the "Brooks Landing" development along the Genesee River.<ref>{{cite web |date=April 21, 2004 |title=Sticking it to the 19th Ward |url=http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/archives/2004/4/Sticking+it+to+the+19th+Ward |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930221133/http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/archives/2004/4/Sticking+it+to+the+19th+Ward |archive-date=September 30, 2011 |access-date=May 7, 2016 |work=City Newspaper}}</ref> [[Gentrification]] has occurred in the 19th Ward and adjacent Plymouth-Exchange area from the conversion of housing stock to student housing for the University of Rochester.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brown |first=James |date=5 June 2019 |title=The state of the neighborhoods |work=Rochester City Magazine |url=https://www.roccitymag.com/news-opinion/the-state-of-the-neighborhoods-10375532 |url-status=live |access-date=29 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231229191444/https://www.roccitymag.com/news-opinion/the-state-of-the-neighborhoods-10375532 |archive-date=29 December 2023}}</ref> Located in the 19th Ward are the [[Arvine Heights Historic District]], [[Chili–West Historic District]], [[Inglewood and Thurston Historic District]], and [[Sibley–Elmdorf Historic District]], listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<ref name="nps">{{cite web |url= https://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20150612.htm |title= National Register of Historic Places Listings |date= June 12, 2015 |work= Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 6/01/15 through 6/05/15 |publisher= National Park Service }}</ref><ref name="nps1">{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20150710.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=July 10, 2015|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 6/29/15 through 7/02/15 |publisher=National Park Service}}</ref><ref name="nps2">{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20150911.htm|title=National Register of Historic Places Listings|date=September 11, 2015|work=Weekly List of Actions Taken on Properties: 8/31/15 through 9/04/15 |publisher=National Park Service}}</ref>

Notable cemeteries include the Victorian-era [[Mount Hope Cemetery, Rochester|Mount Hope Cemetery]], [[Holy Sepulchre Cemetery (Rochester, New York)|Holy Sepulchre]] and [[Riverside Cemetery (Rochester, New York)|Riverside Cemetery]]. Mount Hope became a popular picnicking destination during the late nineteenth century, and the city began to develop public parks.<ref name="LegacyOlmstead">{{cite journal|last1=Wickes|first1=Majorie|last2=O'Connell|first2=Tim|date=April 1988|title=The Legacy of Frederick Law Olmsted|journal=Rochester History|volume=L|issue=2|publisher=Rochester Public Library|issn=0035-7413|url=http://www.rochester.lib.ny.us/~rochhist/v50_1988/v50i2.pdf|access-date=December 29, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608180754/http://www.rochester.lib.ny.us/~rochhist/v50_1988/v50i2.pdf|archive-date=June 8, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> Rochester's park system was initially designed by landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]] in the 1890s. Olmsted intended to preserve natural landscapes for the city residents to enjoy. The system included four major parks: [[Genesee Valley Park]], [[Highland Park (Rochester, New York)|Highland Park]], Maplewood Park, and Seneca Park,<ref name="LegacyOlmstead" /> the last of which is today home to the [[Seneca Park Zoo]].

The park system was expanded in the early twentieth century with Cobb's Hill Park and [[Durand Eastman Park]] in 1908, Edgerton Park in 1911, and Ontario Beach Park in the early 1920s. The Park Commission also constructed new facilities in all parks, filling them with playgrounds, pavilions, and sports facilities. Modern additions to the park system include Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Park, Turning Point Park, and Tryon Park, which are located on former industrial and urban sites, in contrast to the early parks.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Comeau |first1=Katie Eggers |title=125 Years of Rochester's Parks |journal=Rochester History |date=Fall 2013 |volume=75 |issue=2 |url=https://www.libraryweb.org/~rochhist/v75_2013/v75i2.pdf |access-date=28 January 2024}}</ref> Most of the city's parks lie on the Genesee River and can be accessed by the Genesee Riverway Trail, which runs for the river's entire length through the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=GENESEE RIVERWAY TRAIL |url=https://www.cityofrochester.gov/grt/ |website=City of Rochester |access-date=12 October 2023}}</ref> Current city facilities include 12 full-time recreation centers, 48 playgrounds, two artificial ice rinks, 74 softball/baseball fields, 42 tennis courts, four soccer fields, and 45 outdoor basketball courts.<ref>{{cite web |title=Department of Recreation and Human Services |url=https://www.cityofrochester.gov/drhs/ |publisher=City of Rochester |access-date=28 January 2024}}</ref>

==Government==
{{further|List of mayors of Rochester, New York}}
[[File:FederalBuildingRochesterNewYorkFrontView.JPG|thumb|right|[[Rochester City Hall (New York)|Rochester City Hall]]]]
Rochester is governed by a [[mayor]] serving as chief executive of city government and a city council consisting of four district members and five at-large members.<ref>{{cite web |title=Article V, Part A, The Council |url=https://ecode360.com/28971422#28971422 |website=Charter of the City of Rochester |access-date=12 January 2024}}</ref> Rochester has had a [[Strong Mayor|Strong mayor-council]] form of government since the approval of its current charter in a referendum in 1984.<ref name="strongmayor">{{Cite news |date=November 11, 1984 |title=STRONG-MAYOR SYSTEM RETURNING IN ROCHESTER |pages=47 |work=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/11/nyregion/strong-mayor-system-returning-in-rochester.html |access-date=January 12, 2024}}</ref>  Administrative officers are appointed by the mayor and confirmed by the city council.<ref>{{cite web |title=Article II, Administrative Departments |url=https://ecode360.com/28971181 |website=Charter of the City of Rochester |access-date=28 December 2023}}</ref> All city legislation is proposed and passed by the council, and subject to a [[veto]] by the mayor, unless a majority of two-thirds approved it.<ref>{{cite web |title=Article V, Part A, Legislative Acts |url=https://ecode360.com/28971422#28971422 |website=Charter of the City of Rochester |access-date=28 December 2023}}</ref> The current mayor is [[Malik Evans]], serving since January 1, 2022.

Upon the city's charter in 1834, the mayor had few powers and most power was vested in the city council, which was composed of alderman representing individual wards.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McKelvey |first1=Blake |title=ROCHESTER THE WATER - POWER CITY 1812-1854 |date=1945 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge |pages=245–246 |url=https://archive.org/details/rochesterthewate000355mbp/page/n277/mode/2up |access-date=18 January 2024}}</ref> The charter was frequently modified during the 19th century to expand or reduce the mayor's powers, until an 1898 act by the New York State Legislature centralized all appointments under the mayor. The city abolished the mayor's office and adopted a city manager system in a 1925 referendum, after which the mayor became a minor position and the city manager assumed executive authority, with both being chosen by the members of the city council.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=McKelvey |first1=Blake |title=His Honor, The Mayor of Rochester |journal=Rochester History |date=January 1969 |volume=XXXI |issue=1}}</ref> A 1984 referendum restored the Strong mayor system.<ref name="strongmayor" /> [[William A.

=== Courts ===
Rochester is part of the 7th Judicial District of the [[New York Supreme Court]] and the 4th Department of the [[New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division]].

====Rochester City Court====
Rochester City Court is part of the [[judiciary of New York|New York State Unified Court System]]<ref>N.Y. Const. Art. VI, § 17(a).</ref> and consists of ten full-time judges, each of whom is elected to a 10-year term. Each judge must be a city resident and must have been an attorney in New York for at least five years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nysenate.gov/legislation/laws/UCT/2104|title=Legislation|website=NY State Senate}}</ref> Judges have a mandatory retirement age of 70.

Rochester and the surrounding region host a high concentration of colleges and universities, which drive much of the economic growth in the five-county area. The [[University of Rochester]] is the only large research institution primarily within the city limits, although [[Monroe Community College]] and [[State University of New York at Brockport|SUNY Brockport]] operate campuses [[Downtown Rochester|downtown]]. The Highland Park neighborhood was home to [[Colgate Rochester Crozer Divinity School]] (part of whose facility is leased by [[Ithaca College]]'s Department of Physical Therapy) and an office maintained by the [[Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations]].

The University of Rochester is the metropolitan area's oldest and most prominent institution of higher learning, and one of the country's top research centers. It includes a nursing school, the [[William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration|Simon School of Business]], and the [[Eastman School of Music]].

There is marine freight service at the [[Charlotte, Rochester, New York|Port of Rochester]] on Lake Ontario, which is connected to the Atlantic Ocean via the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]. The Erie Canal intersects the Genesee River on the south side of the city.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, a number of passenger ferries operated on Lake Ontario between the Port of Rochester and Canada. Service ended in 1950 when the ''Ontario I'' and ''Ontario II'' ended their route between Rochester and [[Cobourg]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaisson |first1=Bill |title=Fast ferry, past and future |url=https://www.roccitymag.com/news-opinion/fast-ferry-past-and-future-2128356 |website=CITY Magazine |access-date=8 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231208194209/https://www.roccitymag.com/news-opinion/fast-ferry-past-and-future-2128356 |archive-date=8 December 2023 |date=24 December 2003}}</ref> A new ferry, the [[HSC Virgen de Coromoto|Spirit of Ontario I]], operated between Rochester and Toronto from June 17, 2004, to December 12, 2005.

The initial operator, [[Canadian American Transportation Systems]] (CATS), went bankrupt by the end of the 2004 season. The city of Rochester then purchased the ferry and signed a contract with [[Bay Ferries Great Lakes]] to resume operations in 2005. The resumption of service was delayed until summer, causing the ferry to continue to operate at a loss. In 2006, the operation was shut down and the ferry was sold.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fast Ferry failure: Timeline of Rochester's doomed vessel |url=https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/digital-exclusives/fast-ferry-failure-timeline-of-rochesters-doomed-vessel/ |website=Rochester First |access-date=8 December 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191224155814/https://www.rochesterfirst.com/news/digital-exclusives/fast-ferry-failure-timeline-of-rochesters-doomed-vessel/ |archive-date=24 December 2019 |date=23 December 2019}}</ref>

Three exits off the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]]) serve Rochester. Rochester's expressway system, conceived in the 1950s, was designed as two concentric circles with feeder expressways from the west, south and east. The system allows for quick travel within the metropolitan area and a lack of the traffic gridlock typically found in cities of comparable size; in part this is because the system was designed to accommodate rapid travel between the suburbs and downtown,<ref>{{Cite news|last=Harrison|first=David|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/highways-give-way-to-homes-as-cities-rebuild-11575208801|title=Highways Give Way to Homes as Cities Rebuild|date=December 1, 2019|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=March 5, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660|archive-date=March 25, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200325131347/https://www.wsj.com/articles/highways-give-way-to-homes-as-cities-rebuild-11575208801|url-status=live}}</ref> and also because it was built when the city's population was over 330,000, whereas today it is a full third less.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Schneider|first=Keith|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/business/old-highway-paves-road-for-recovery-in-rochester.html|title=Taking Out a Highway That Hemmed Rochester In|date=November 1, 2016|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=March 5, 2020|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-date=August 3, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803022607/https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/business/old-highway-paves-road-for-recovery-in-rochester.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[New York State Route 47|Outer Loop]] circles just outside the city limits while the former [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]] once circled around the immediate downtown area within the city (the easternmost sector was closed in 2015). From the west are [[Lake Ontario State Parkway]], [[New York State Route 531|NY 531]] and [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]]; [[Interstate 390|I-390]] feeds from the south; and [[New York State Route 104|NY 104]], [[New York State Route 441|NY 441]], and [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] approach from the east.

In the early 1970s, the Genesee Expressway Task Force, City leaders, and the New York State Department of Transportation studied the feasibility of connecting the outer and inner Loops with a new southern expressway. The proposed route extended north from the I-390 and I-590 interchange in Brighton, cutting through Rochester's Swillburg neighborhood. In 1972, consultants Berger Lehman Associates recommended a new 'Busway', an expressway with dedicated bus lanes, similar to Bus Rapid Transit.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pritchard| first=Keith|title=Fate of 'Busway' Rests With Drivers|newspaper=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle|date=December 24, 1972}}</ref> The expressway extension was never built.

[[File:I-390.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 390|I-390]] (Genesee Expressway)
*I-390 runs south–north, crossing [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]] (exit 46) and routing north through Rochester's western suburbs. Its northern end is at [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]], however, it continues north as [[New York State Route 390|NY 390]] until it merges into the [[Lake Ontario State Parkway]]. South of I-90, I-390 runs to [[Avoca, New York|Avoca]], where it meets with [[U.S. Route 15 in New York|US 15]] and the Southern Tier Expressway, [[Interstate 86 (Pennsylvania-New York)|I-86]].
[[File:I-490.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] (Western/Eastern Expressway)
*I-490 runs west–east through Rochester, starting at [[Le Roy, New York|Le Roy]] and ending in [[Victor, New York|Victor]]. It interchanges with the two other Interstates in Rochester: I-390 at the western city limit and [[Interstate 590|I-590]] at the eastern limit, as well as connecting at both ends with the Thruway, [[Interstate 90 in New York|I-90]] (exits 47 and 45). In July 2007, a new bridge over the [[Genesee River]] was completed and named the [[Frederick Douglass–Susan B. Anthony Memorial Bridge]].
[[File:I-590.svg|25px]] [[Interstate 590|I-590]]
*I-590 runs south–north through Rochester's eastern suburbs. Its southern end is at I-390, while the northern terminus is at [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]]; the highway continues north to the shore of Lake Ontario as [[New York State Route 590|NY 590]].
*In decreasing usage is the term "[[Can of Worms (interchange)|Can of Worms]]", referring to the previously dangerous at-grade intersection of [[Interstate 490 (New York)|I-490]] and expressway [[New York State Route 590|NY 590]] on the eastern edge of the Rochester city limits, bordering the suburb of [[Brighton, Monroe County, New York|Brighton]]. In the 1980s, a multimillion-dollar project created a system of overpasses and ramps that reduced the danger but resulted in the loss of certain exits.

[[File:NY-104.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 104|NY 104]] (Irondequoit-Wayne County Expressway, West Ridge Road)
*NY 104 – Just east of the NY 590 interchange, NY 104 becomes the Irondequoit-Wayne County Expressway and crosses the [[Irondequoit Bay Bridge]]. On the other side of the Bay Bridge, in the town of Webster, NY 104 has exits before returning to an at-grade highway at Basket Road.
[[File:NY-390.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 390|NY 390]]
*NY 390 is an extension of Interstate 390 from the I-390/I-490 interchange in Gates. The northern terminus is at the Lake Ontario State Parkway in Greece, less than a mile from the Lake Ontario shoreline.
[[File:NY-590.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 590|NY 590]]
*NY 590 is a limited-access extension of Interstate 590 that runs from an interchange between Interstate 490 and I-590 on the Brighton/Rochester border. The northern terminus is at Culver Road in Irondequoit, near Sea Breeze (the western shore of Irondequoit Bay at Lake Ontario).
[[File:Rochester Inner Loop.svg|25px]] [[Inner Loop (Rochester)|Inner Loop]]
*The Inner Loop Runs from I-490 to Main Street on the north end and from 490 to Monroe Avenue at the south end. Formerly a loop, the eastern end was demolished and replaced with a surface road between 2014 and 2017. Unsigned reference NY 940T begins and ends at I-490, and the rest of the Loop is part of I-490 between exits 13 and 15, including the [[Frederick Douglass–Susan B. Anthony Memorial Bridge]]. This expressway is commonly used to define the borders of Downtown Rochester.

[[File:Lake Ontario State Parkway.svg|25px]] [[Lake Ontario State Parkway]]
*Lake Ontario State Parkway travels from [[Lakeside Beach State Park]] in Carlton, Orleans County. The eastern end is at Lake Avenue in the city of Rochester in Monroe County.
