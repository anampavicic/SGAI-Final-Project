The name ''Islamabad'' means ''City of Islam''. It is derived from two words: ''Islam'' and ''abad''. ''Islam'' refers to the religion of [[Islam]], Pakistan's [[state religion]], and ''[[-abad]]'' is a [[Persian language|Persian]] suffix meaning ''cultivated place'', indicating an inhabited place or city.<ref name="Adrian Room">{{cite book|author=Adrian Room|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M1JIPAN-eJ4C&pg=PA177|title=Placenames of the World|date=13 December 2005|publisher=McFarland & Company|isbn=978-0786422487|page=177}}</ref> According to a history book by [[Muhammad Ismail Zabeeh]], teacher and poet [[Qazi Abdur Rehman Amritsari]] proposed the name of the city.<ref>{{cite web|last=Capital Talk|date=6 February 2020|title=Islamabad Ka Naam Kisney Rakha Tha, Qaum Be-Khabr Kyun?|trans-title=Who Named Islamabad, Why Is the Nation Unaware?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5BsT0rX5Zs&t=0m27s| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/v5BsT0rX5Zs| archive-date=2021-12-11 | url-status=live|access-date=26 June 2020|website=YouTube|language=ur|type=Video|via=Geo News}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/urdu/pakistan-60496544 |title=اسلام آباد: پاکستان کے وفاقی دارالحکومت کا نام کس نے اور کیسے تجویز کیا؟ |newspaper=BBC News اردو |accessdate=2022-02-26 |archive-date=24 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220224060913/https://www.bbc.com/urdu/pakistan-60496544 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Construction and development===
{{Main|Developments in Islamabad}}
When Pakistan gained independence in 1947, the southern port city of [[Karachi]] was its provisional national capital. In 1958, a commission was constituted to select a suitable site near [[Rawalpindi]] for the national capital with particular emphasis on location, climate, logistics, and defence requirements, along with other attributes. After extensive study, research, and a thorough review of potential sites, the commission recommended the area northeast of Rawalpindi in 1959 which was used as provisional capital from that year on.<ref name="New Orient"/><ref name="M.

Islamabad's architecture is a combination of modernity and old [[Islamic architecture|Islamic]] and regional traditions. The [[Saudi-Pak Tower]] is an example of the integration of modern architecture with traditional styles.

=== Shah Allah Ditta Caves ===
Shah Allah Ditta village is a centuries-old village and a Union Council of Islamabad Capital Authority. The village is named after a [[dervish]] that belonged to the Mughal era. It is estimated to be 650 years old approximately. It is also home to ancient caves that reflects the previous civilizations. The 2500-year-old Buddhist caves at the foot of Margalla Hills are located in west of Taxila, east of Islamabad and in the central area of Khanpur. A spring, a pond and a garden still exist near the Shah Allah Ditta Caves. There are some banyan trees in the garden, while all other fruit trees are gone. The water from the same spring was used to irrigate the garden adjoining the caves. During the Mughal period, when India was the centre of Sufism originating from Arabia and Central Asia, a saint named Shah Allah Ditta stayed in this garden and was entombed here. The place formerly attributed to sadhus, monks, or jogis is today known for the famous Sufi Shah Allah Ditta. A short distance from these caves is also an ancient baoli (stepwell) in the village of Kanthila, which is said to have been built by [[Sher Shah Suri]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-06-09 |title=Shah Allah Ditta caves – relic of ancient Buddhism |url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/2360839/shah-allah-ditta-caves-relic-of-ancient-buddhism |access-date=2023-02-24 |website=The Express Tribune |language=en |archive-date=5 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220705020116/https://tribune.com.pk/story/2360839/shah-allah-ditta-caves-relic-of-ancient-buddhism |url-status=live }}</ref>
