'''Davao City''', officially the '''City of Davao''' ({{langx|ceb|Dakbayan sa Dabaw}}; {{langx|hil|Dakbanwa sang Davao}}; {{langx|tl|Lungsod ng Dabaw}}), is a [[City of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Davao Region]], Philippines. The city has a total land area of {{convert|2,443.61|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, making it the [[List of Philippine cities and municipalities by area|largest city in the Philippines in terms of land area]]. It is the [[List of Philippine cities and municipalities by population|third-most populous city in the Philippines]] after [[Quezon City]] and [[Manila]] respectively, and the most populous city in [[Mindanao]], in Davao Region, and outside of Metro Manila.{{PH census|2015}} According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 1,776,949 people.<ref name="2020Popcen"/>

It is the largest city in the province of [[Davao del Sur]] both in population and land area wherein it is geographically situated and grouped under the province by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], but the city is governed and administered independently from it. The city is divided into three congressional districts, which are subdivided into 11 administrative districts with a total of 182 [[barangay]]s.

Davao City is the regional center of [[Davao Region]] and also the center of [[Metro Davao]], the [[List of metropolitan areas in the Philippines|second most populous metropolitan area in the Philippines]]. The city serves as the main trade, commerce, and industry hub of Mindanao, and the regional center of Davao Region. The region of Davao is home to [[Mount Apo]], the highest mountain in the Philippines, which is highly visible in most parts of Davao City. The city is also nicknamed the "[[Durian]] Capital of the Philippines".

==Etymology==
The region's name is derived from its [[Bagobo]] origins, who are indigenous to the area. The word ''davao'' came from the phonetic blending of three [[Lumad peoples|Bagobo]] subgroups' names for the [[Davao River]], a major waterway emptying into [[Davao Gulf]] near the city. The Obos, who inhabit the hinterlands of the region, called the river ''Davah'' (with a gentle vowel ending, although later pronunciation is with a hard ''v'' or ''b''); the Clatta (or Giangan/Diangan) called it ''Dawaw'', and the Tagabawas called it ''Dabo''. To the Obos, ''davah'' also means "a place beyond the high grounds" (alluding to settlements at the mouth of the river surrounded by high, rolling hills).<ref>{{cite web|last1=|first1=|date=|title=History: Know Davao City|url=https://www.davaocity.gov.ph/know-davao-city/history/|access-date=January 18, 2021|website=The Official Website of the City Government of Davao|publisher=The City Government of Davao}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last1=Medina|first1=Marielle|last2=de Villa|first2=Kathleen|date=March 23, 2019|title=Dynamic Davao City on the rise|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=https://business.inquirer.net/267257/dynamic-davao-city-on-the-rise|access-date=January 18, 2021}}</ref>

==History==
===Precolonial era===
The area of what is now Davao City was once a lush forest inhabited by [[Lumad]]ic peoples such as the [[Bagobo people|Bagobos]]<ref name=nccabagobo>{{cite web|title=Bagobo|url=https://ncca.gov.ph/about-ncca-3/subcommissions/subcommission-on-cultural-communities-and-traditional-arts-sccta/central-cultural-communities/bagobo/|access-date=August 27, 2021|archive-date=August 27, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210827095501/https://ncca.gov.ph/about-ncca-3/subcommissions/subcommission-on-cultural-communities-and-traditional-arts-sccta/central-cultural-communities/bagobo/|url-status=dead}}</ref> and [[Matigsalug people|Matigsalugs]],<ref>{{cite web| author = Reuel John F.

Canoy| year = 2001| pages= 192–193|oclc = 65200999}}</ref> and as a result the Davao Gulf area remained virtually untouched by European explorers for the next three centuries.

===Maguindanao era===
A [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanaon]] Datu under the name [[Datu Bago]] was rewarded the territory of the surroundings of Davao Gulf by the [[Sultan]] of [[Maguindanao Sultanate]] for joining the [[Spanish-Moro conflict|campaign]] against the Spanish in the late 1700s. From his ancestral home in [[Maguindanao]], he moved to the area in 1800 and, having convinced Bagobos and other native groups in the area to his side, conquered the entire Davao Gulf area.<ref name=macariotiu>{{cite book |first1=Macario |last1=Tiu |year=2005 |title=Davao, Reconstructing History from Text to Memory |publisher=Ateneo de Davao |isbn=9710392050}}</ref> Having consolidated his position, he founded the fortress of ''Pinagurasan'' in what is now the site of Bangkerohan Public Market<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-05-24 |title=Bankerohan Public Market: The Largest And Busiest Market In Davao City |url=https://davaocorporate.info/listings/bankerohan-public-market/ |access-date=2024-03-20 |language=en-US}}</ref> in 1830 which served as his capital.<ref name=sunstardatubago>{{cite web|title=Datu Mama Bago: villain or hero?|date=March 16, 2019 |url=https://mindanaotimes.com.ph/2019/03/16/datu-mama-bago-villain-or-hero/| publisher=[[Mindanao Times]]|access-date=August 27, 2021}}</ref> From being a fortification and base of operations from which Datu Bago could gather and rally his forces, the settlement of Pinagurasan eventually grew into a small city extending from present-day Generoso Bridge in Bangkerohan to Quezon Boulevard more than a kilometer down south,<ref name=macariotiu/>{{rp|172–176}} as Maguindanaons and Bagobos alike among other nearby tribes in the area flocked into the settlement, eventually becoming the main trade entrepot in the Davao Gulf area.<ref name="karlgaspar"/> With his immense overlordship of Davao Gulf, Datu Bago was eventually crowned Sultan by his subjects at his capital Pinagurasan in 1843, effectively making his realm virtually independent from the Sultanate of Maguindanao, becoming a Sultanate with sovereignty over Davao Gulf in equal standing with the Muslim kingdoms of [[Sultanate of Maguindanao|Maguindanao]] and [[Sulu Sultanate|Sulu]].<ref name=sunstardatubago/>

===Spanish era===
Although the Spaniards began to explore the Davao Gulf area as early as the 16th century, Spanish influence was negligible in the Davao region until 1842, when the Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines [[Narciso Clavería y Zaldúa, 1st Count of Manila|Narciso Clavería]] ordered the colonization of the [[Davao Gulf]] region, including what is now Davao City, for the Spanish Crown. This came after the [[Spanish American wars of independence|loss]] of their [[Spanish America|colonies]] in the [[Americas]] from the 1820s to 1830s which gravely reduced their sources of revenue to the point that the royal government in [[Madrid]] could no longer continue to properly provide financial support to what remained of its worldwide colonies. Thus, it became more urgent for local officials in the colonies, including the Philippines, to find ways and means of expanding the revenues in running the colonies, primarily in terms of tribute extracted from the natives. It meant that for the first time, the Spanish colonial government in the Philippines was compelled to embark on a full-scale conquest of Mindanao in the hopes of increasing its coffers.<ref name="karlgaspar"/>

Davao Gulf seemed to be a tempting target among Spanish military circles based in Manila for its thriving maritime trade taking place there.<ref name="karlgaspar"/> Their initial forays began with their incursion on the village of [[Governor Generoso, Davao Oriental|Sigaboy]] in 1842, from which the local Spanish officials who recently landed there immediately demanded heavy tribute on the natives who then asked for Datu Bago's help in expelling the Spaniards, which he responded swiftly by sending a combined naval and land force in the area to defeat and drive out the Spanish force there.<ref name=sunstardatubago/> The Spanish, seeing Datu Bago as a mere pirate and brigand, didn't take the threat seriously for years despite his numerous victories against them until the burning of the Spanish trading vessel ''San Rufo'', which carried a letter of friendship from Sultan Iskandar Qudaratullah Muhammad Zamal al-Azam of Maguindanao to Governor-General Claveria, and its massacre of all its crew by seaborne corsairs under orders from Datu Bago himself in 1846.<ref name="karlgaspar"/><ref name=sunstardatubago/> Incensed with the incident, the Spanish secured the consent from the Sultan of Maguindanao who finally disowned the Moros of Davao Gulf by using the incident as pretext for justification to conquer the area. Thus, the official Spanish colonization of Davao Gulf finally began in earnest in April 1848 when an expedition of 70 men and women led by José Cruz de Oyanguren of [[Bergara|Vergara]], Spain, landed on the estuary of the Davao River the same month, intent on conquering Pinagurasan, the capital of Datu Bago's domain, in the hopes of permanently ending the menace posed on Spanish vessels by Moro raiders in Davao Gulf.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://edgedavao.net/special-supplement/2020/03/17/1848/ |title=1848|date=March 17, 2020 |publisher=Edge Davao|access-date=August 28, 2021}}</ref>

Being the strongest chieftain in the region, Datu Bago imposed heavy tribute on the [[Mandaya]] tribes nearby, therefore also making him the most loathed chieftain in the region. Cruz de Uyanguren had orders from the higher authorities in [[Manila]] to colonize the Davao Gulf region, which included the Bagobo settlement on the northern riverbank; in return, he asked for the position of the governor of the conquered area and the monopoly of its commerce for ten years. At this juncture, a Mandaya chieftain named Datu Daupan, who then ruled [[Samal Island]], came to him, seeking for an alliance against Datu Bago.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/sunstar-davao/20140706/281612418502280 |title=The bridge you cross is their home |via=PressReader |date=2014-07-06}}</ref> The two chieftains were archrivals, and Cruz de Uyanguren took advantage of it, initiating an alliance between Spain and the Mandayas of Samal Island. Intent on taking the settlement for Spain, he and his men accordingly assaulted it, but the Bagobo natives fiercely resisted the attacks, which resulted in his Samal Mandaya allies to desert. Thus, a three-month long inconclusive battle for the possession of the settlement ensued which was only decided when an infantry company which sailed its way by warships from [[Zamboanga City|Zamboanga]] came in as reinforcements, thus ensuring the takeover of the settlement and its surroundings by the Spaniards while the defeated Bagobos fled further inland<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://philippinescities.com/davao-city-davao-del-sur/|title=Davao City History &#124; Tourist Spots and Festivals &#124; Philippines Cities}}</ref> while Datu Bago and his followers fled north to [[Tagum|Hijo]] where he would die two years later.<ref name=macariotiu/>

After Cruz de Oyanguren defeated Bago and conquered Pinagurasan, he founded the town of ''Nueva Vergara'', the future Davao, in the mangrove swamps of what is now Bolton Riverside on June 29, 1848,<ref>{{cite book |first1=Camilo T. |last1=Nunez |first2=Dante P. |last2=Diansay |year=2003 |title=Cateel Centennial Book |publisher=Local Government Unit of Cateel |pages=550}}</ref> in honor of his home in Spain and became its first [[governor]]. Pinagurasan was then incorporated into the new town. Almost two years later on February 29, 1850, the province of ''[[:es:Nueva Guipúzcoa|Nueva Guipúzcoa]]'' was established via a royal decree, with the newly founded town as the capital,<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://catalogo.bne.es/uhtbin/cgisirsi/0/x/0/05?searchdata1=bimo0001651973|title=Diccionario geográfico, estadístico, histórico de las islas Filipinas ...

When he was the governor of the province, however, his plans of fostering a positive economic sway on the region backfired, which resulted in his eventual replacement under orders of the colonial government.

The province of Nueva Guipuzcoa was dissolved on July 30, 1860, as it became the Politico-Military Commandery of Davao.<ref>{{Cite book|title=El archipiélago filipino.

The Spanish control of the town was unstable at best, as its [[Lumad]] and [[Moro people|Moro]] natives routinely resisted the attempts of the Spanish authorities to forcibly resettle them and convert them into Christianity.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph//article/423712|title=Davao City's history: Vibrant and exciting|first=Cristina E.|last=Alivio|date=March 16, 2018|work=SunStar}}</ref> Despite all these, such were all done with the goal of making the governance of the area easier, dividing the Christians—both settlers and native converts—and the Muslim Moros into several religion-based communities within the town.

=== During the Philippine Revolution ===
As the [[Philippine Revolution]], having been fought for two years, neared its end in 1898, the expected departure of the Spanish authorities in Davao became apparent, although they took no part in the war at all, owing to the lack of revolutionary figures in the area save for a negligible pro-Filipino separatist rebel movement in the town of [[Santa Cruz, Davao del Sur|Santa Cruz]] in the south.<ref>{{cite web |author=Santa Cruz, Davao del Sur Government |title=History |url=http://www.stacruz.gov.ph/history.php |access-date=September 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921053810/http://www.stacruz.gov.ph/history.php |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> When the war finally ended, as the Spanish authorities finally left the town, two Davaoeño locals by the names of Pedro Layog and Jose M.

The period of Filipino revolutionary control of Davao did not last long, however, as the Americans landed at the town later the same year. There was no record of locals offering any sort of resistance to the Americans.

===American period===
[[File:Philippine Island - Mindanao - NARA - 68156188.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Davao, 1935]]

As the Americans began their administration of the town in 1900, economic opportunities quickly arose as huge swathes of its areas, mainly lush forests and fertile grasslands, were declared open for agricultural investment. As a result, foreign businessmen, especially Japanese entrepreneurs, started settling the region, staking their claims on the vast lands of Davao and turning them into huge coconut and banana plantations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edgedavao.net/araw-ng-dabaw/2017/03/16/davao-city-80-years-making/|title=Davao City: 80 years in the making|first=Antonio V.|last=Figueroa|date=March 16, 2017 }}</ref> In just a short period, Davao changed from a small and sparsely-inhabited town into a bustling economic center serving the [[Davao Gulf]] region, heavily populated alongside natives by tens of thousands of settlers and economic migrants from [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]] and Japan. The [[Port of Davao]] was established and opened the same year to facilitate the international export of agricultural products from Davao.

[[File:Davao Japantown in 1930s.JPG|thumb|alt=Man bicycling down street in old photo, with cars in background|Japan-town, Davao City (circa 1930s)]]

Because of the rapidly increasing progress of the town, on March 16, 1936, congressman Romualdo Quimpo from Davao filed ''Bill 609'' (passed as ''Commonwealth Act 51''), creating the City of Davao from the town of Davao and the municipal district of [[Districts of Davao City|Guianga]]. The bill called for the appointment of local officials by the president. By that time, the new city was already mostly populated with Japanese businessmen and settlers who then became its locals.<ref name=macariotiu/> Davao was inaugurated as a [[charter city]] on October 16, 1936, by President [[Manuel L. Quezon]];<ref name="TheCorpusJuris-CA51">{{cite web |title=C.A.

The [[Battle of Mindanao|Battle of Davao]] towards the end of [[World War II]] was one of the longest and bloodiest battles during the Philippine Liberation, and brought tremendous destruction to the city, setting back the economic and physical strides made before the Japanese occupation.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

Davao regained its status as the agricultural and economic hub of Mindanao after the war ended in 1945. Wood products such as plywood and timber, and more agricultural products being produced within the city, such as copra and other varieties of banana, became available for export. Some Japanese locals—80% percent of the city's population prior to the war's end—assimilated with the Filipino population, while others were expelled from the country by the Filipino locals, due to recent enmity.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://davaoofthepast.com/2016/05/20/blog-post-title-3/ |title=Davao history timeline |date=May 20, 2016 |access-date=November 19, 2018 |archive-date=November 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181119214636/https://davaoofthepast.com/2016/05/20/blog-post-title-3/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Davao was peaceful and increasingly progressive in the postwar period, including the 1950s and the mid-1960s.

By the late 1960s, Davao had become the regional capital of southern Mindanao; with the reorganization, it became the regional capital of the [[Davao Region]] (Region XI) and a highly urbanized city in the province of Davao del Sur.

Things began to take a turn for the worse late into [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' first presidential term, when news about the [[Jabidah massacre]] ignited a furor in the Moro community, and ethnic tensions encouraged with the formation of secessionist movements.<ref>{{cite book |author=George, T.J.S. |title=Revolt in Mindanao: the rise of Islam in Philippine politics |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/6569089 |location=Kuala Lumpur |year=1980 |isbn=0-19-580429-5 |oclc=6569089}}</ref> An economic crisis in late 1969 led to social unrest, and violent crackdowns on protests led to the radicalization of many students throughout the country.<ref>{{cite web |last=Rodis |first=Rodel |title=Remembering the First Quarter Storm |url=https://globalnation.inquirer.net/118130/remembering-the-first-quarter-storm |website=inquirer.net |date=January 30, 2015 |access-date=September 15, 2020}}</ref> With no way to express their grievances about government abuses after the declaration of Martial law in 1972, many of them joined the [[New People's Army]] (NPA), bringing the [[Communist rebellion in the Philippines]] to Davao and the rest of Mindanao for the first time.<ref name="MiclatinArguillas" /> The movement would continue to grow over the next decade, but was continuing to struggle by the early 1980s, convincing prominent party thinker and idealogue [[Edgar Jopson]] to be based there, until he was killed after a raid in Skyline Subdivision in September 1982.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-09-21 |title=The Life and Death of Edgar Jopson |url=https://hrvvmemcom.gov.ph/the-life-and-death-of-edgar-jopson/ |website=Human Rights Violations Victims' Memorial Commission |publisher=Government of the Republic of the Philippines}}</ref>

==Geography==
Davao City is approximately {{convert|588|mi|km|order=flip}} southeast of Manila over land, and {{convert|971|km|nmi}} by sea. The city is located in southeastern Mindanao, on the northwestern shore of [[Davao Gulf]], opposite [[Samal, Davao del Norte|Samal Island]]. [[Mount Apo]] and [[Apo–Talomo Mountain range|Mount Talomo]] can be seen from here.

===Barangay===
{{main|Barangays of Davao City}}
Davao City politically subdivided into 182 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s  while some have [[sitios]].

===Topography===
[[File:Davao river mouth.JPG|thumb|upright|200px|Mouth of the [[Davao River]] in Talomo District]]
[[File:MountApo1.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|[[Mount Apo]] is the tallest mountain in the Philippines.]]

Davao City's land, totaling about {{convert|2,443.61|km2}}, is hilly in the west (the Marilog district) and slopes down to the southeastern shore. [[Mount Apo]], the highest peak in the Philippines, is located at the city's southwestern tip. Mount Apo National Park (the mountain and its surrounding vicinity), was inaugurated by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Manuel L. Quezon]] (in ''Proclamation 59'' of May 8, 1936) to protect the flora and fauna of the surrounding mountain range.<ref name="GovPH-Proc59">{{cite web |title=Proclamation No. 59, s. 1936 |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1936/05/09/proclamation-no-59-s-1936/ |website=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines|date=May 9, 1936 |access-date=April 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421141347/https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1936/05/09/proclamation-no-59-s-1936/ |archive-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref>

The [[Davao River]] is the city's primary drainage channel. Draining an area of over {{convert|1700|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, the {{convert|160|km|mi|adj=on}} river begins in the town of [[San Fernando, Bukidnon]]. The mouth of the river is located at Barangay Bucana at Talomo District.

===Climate===
Davao has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Af''), with little seasonal variation in temperature. The areological mechanism of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] occurs more often than that of the [[trade wind]]s and because it experiences rare cyclones the climate is not purely equatorial but subequatorial. Average monthly temperatures are always above {{convert|26|C|1}}, and average monthly rainfall is above {{convert|77|mm|in|2}}. This gives the city a tropical climate, without a true [[dry season]]; while there is significant rainfall in winter, the largest rainfall occurs during the summer months (see climate chart, below).

As of the 2020 census, the city has a total population of 1,776,949 people.<ref name="2020Popcen"/> [[Metro Davao]], with the city as its center, had about 2.77 million inhabitants in 2015, making it the [[Cities of the Philippines#Metropolitan areas|third-most-populous metropolitan area]] in the Philippines and the most-populous city in Mindanao. In the 1995 census, the city's population reached 1,006,840 inhabitants, becoming the first city in the Philippines outside [[Metro Manila]] and the fourth nationwide to exceed one million inhabitants. The city's population increase during the 20th century was due to massive immigration waves coming from other parts of the nation and the trend continues to this day.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/242629/davao-now-most-populous-urban-area-after-metro-manila |title=Davao now most populous urban area after Metro Manila |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer}}</ref>

===Ethnicities===
[[File:Bagobo woman.jpg|thumb|170px|left|alt=A [[Matigsalug]] woman in a red decorated tribal blouse making tribal bracelets|A [[Matigsalug]] woman from Davao]]
Residents of Davao City and the whole corresponding Davao Region are colloquially known as ''[[Davaoeño people|Davaoeños]]''. Nearly all local Davaoeños, mostly descended from migrant settlers from [[Visayas]] in recent centuries and decades, are [[Visayans]] (the majority are [[Cebuano people|Cebuanos]], with the rest being [[Hiligaynon people|Ilonggos]] ([[Hiligaynon people|Hiligaynon]] speakers)) and the respective [[Filipino Mestizos|mestizos]] from those groups, while others of different ethnicities—especially the indigenous people, who are collectively categorized as [[Lumad]]s—make up the remainder of the local population. The Davao City residents of non-Visayan ethnicity are mostly [[Tagalog people|Tagalogs]], [[Kapampangan people|Kapampangans]], [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]], and their respective [[Filipino Mestizos|mestizos]] from those groups, which are also descendants of migrant settlers from [[Luzon]], particularly [[Metro Manila]], [[Central Luzon]], [[Calabarzon]],  [[Ilocos Region]], the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]], and [[Cagayan Valley]]. The [[Moro people|Moro]] ethnic groups of the city include the [[Maguindanao people|Maguindanaons]], [[Maranao people|Maranaos]], [[Iranun]]s, [[Tausūg people|Tausugs]] and [[Sama-Bajau peoples|Sama-Bajaus]]. There are also historical and recent migrant [[Chinese Filipino]]s and [[Japanese settlement in the Philippines|Japanese Filipinos]] coming from other parts of the Philippines that have made sizable communities in Davao. Modern more recent migrants also include [[Indonesians]], [[Malaysians]], [[Chinese people]] (both from [[China]] and [[Taiwan]]), [[Japanese people]], and [[Koreans in the Philippines#Davao|Koreans]], that have recently settled and made small communities in Davao City. Non-Asian foreigners, such as Americans and Europeans, are also present in the city in small numbers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ethnicity in the Philippines (2020 Census of Population and Housing) {{!}} Philippine Statistics Authority {{!}} Republic of the Philippines |url=https://www.psa.gov.ph/content/ethnicity-philippines-2020-census-population-and-housing |access-date=2024-06-22 |website=www.psa.gov.ph}}</ref>

===Languages===
[[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] is the most widely spoken language in the city and its satellite cities and towns, while [[Filipino language|Filipino]] ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) comes close as second most spoken casual language. [[Philippine English|English]] is the [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|formal]] [[medium of instruction]] in schools and is widely understood by residents, who often use it in varying professional fields. Aside from the aforementioned languages, [[Chavacano#Castellano Abakay|Chavacano Davaoeño]] and [[Hiligaynon language|Hiligaynon]] are also spoken by a minority in addition to languages indigenous to the city, such as [[Giangan language|Giangan]], [[Kalagan language|Kalagan]], [[Tagabawa language|Tagabawa]], [[Matigsalug language|Matigsalug]], [[Ata Manobo language|Ata Manobo]], and [[Obo language|Obo]]. Other languages varyingly spoken as well in the city include [[Maguindanao language|Maguindanao]], [[Maranao language|Maranao]], [[Sama–Bajaw languages|Sama–Bajaw]], [[Iranun language|Iranun]], [[Tausug language|Tausug]], [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] and [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]]. [[Philippine Hokkien]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] can also be heard privately spoken by [[Chinese Filipino]]s and [[Japanese in the Philippines|Japanese Filipinos]] among their fellows in Davao, whereas [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] ([[Standard Chinese]]) and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is also taught in Chinese class and Japanese class of [[Chinese school|Chinese Filipino schools]] and [[Japanese school|Japanese Nikkei Filipino schools]].

A linguistic phenomenon has developed in the city whereby locals significantly mix [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] terms and grammar into their [[Cebuano language|Cebuano Bisaya]] speech because of varying reasons such as, the normalcy of the older generations of Cebuano-speaking families speaking Tagalog to their children at home, some migrant settlers to the city are also from [[Luzon]] where Tagalog is mainstream, and the modern Filipino [[mass media]] is also mostly in [[Filipino language|Filipino]] ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]) and Filipino [[Class (education)|class]] is also taught in schools in Davao, while [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] is spoken in other everyday settings, making [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] a secondary casual [[lingua franca]].

==Culture and heritage==

===Foreign influence===
[[File:Davao_Chinatown_(Davao_City;_11-24-2021).jpg|thumb|Davao City's Chinatown is said to be the Philippines' biggest in terms of land area.]]
As with most cities in the Philippines, Christianity is widespread as a result of Spanish colonialism. Christian churches and chapels dot the city's landscape. A small number of temples, mosques and other religions' places of worship may also be found around the city.

A notable tradition brought by the Spanish still celebrated today in Davao City is the celebration of the feast day of each of the [[barrio]]s (villages) patron saints with a [[festival]] (''fiesta''). These are celebrated through song and dance.

The biggest celebration native to the city is the [[Kadayawan Festival]] in early to mid August which, in pre-colonial times was a celebration of the harvest. Today, it serves to commemorate the cultures of the indigenous tribes that inhabit the area surrounding Davao City. Many tribes people visit the city during this time. Festivities include native Mindanaoan street dances, motorcades featuring various clubs and social awareness groups based in the city and art exhibits in various locations featuring local artists and artisans.
[[File:Indak-Indak 1.jpg|thumb|left|''I-indak sa kadalanan'' or the Street dancing competition, part of [[Kadayawan Festival]] celebration.]]

The [[Davao Chinatown]] is the primary residence of the Chinese community in the city. It has its own seaport, the Santa Ana Wharf, which is also a part of [[Port of Davao|Davao International Port]].

[[Japanese culture|Japanese cultural influence]], like the Chinese, is also prominent in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph//article/120221|title=Davao as furusato: The shared history of Davao and Japan|first=Stella A.|last=Estremera|date=January 12, 2017|website=Sunstar}}</ref> The Japanese community was concentrated in Barangay Mintal in the District of Tugbok, Davao City. In fact, a Japanese cemetery and Japanese shrine is located there. Evidence of Japanese influence are still visible in Mintal. There are various Japanese-owned businesses in the city as well. Davao City is also home to Philippine Nikkei Jin Kai International School, a Japanese-administered educational institution.

Several foreign communities reside in the city, including Indonesians, Malaysians, Koreans and Indians. There are [[ESL]] schools for foreigners, and export-oriented industrial parks to entice Japanese and (South) Korean firms to set up shop in the city. However, there has been some cultural conflict over the integration of Koreans in the city, with then-city mayor Rodrigo Duterte complaining about their habit of smoking in public places.<ref>{{citation |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20070902-86154/Davao_City_mayor_frowns_on_Koreans%92_smoking_in_public_places |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=September 2, 2007 |access-date=May 22, 2011 |last=Tupas |first=Jeffrey M.|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904151305/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view_article.php?article_id=86154 |archive-date=September 4, 2007|title=Davao City mayor frowns on Koreans' smoking in public places}}</ref>

Japanese historical sites include the Japanese Tunnel (used by Japanese forces during World War II), the 20th-century Japanese cemetery (now located inside Mintal Public Cemetery in Brgy. Mintal) and the Furukawa Fiber Plant (used by Yoshizo Furukawa as an abacá and banana plantation).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://davaotoday.com/sections/guide/museums.php|title=Fair. In-Depth.

===Cuisine===

The cuisine of Davao City features skewered and grilled meat dishes, but the most common dish served in the city is [[kinilaw]], made from [[tuna]], [[mackerel]], or [[swordfish]] with [[cucumber]] (and sometimes [[radish]]es) and [[chili pepper|chili]] marinated in vinegar. ''Sinuglaw'', a portmanteau of ''sinugba'' (grilled) and ''kinilaw'' in the Cebuano language, is also a term for a dish in which diced, grilled pork belly is mixed with ''kinilaw''.

Fruit dishes, snacks, and desserts are also popular, most made from durian and bananas. [[Durian]] also made appearance on Davao's culinary scene.
