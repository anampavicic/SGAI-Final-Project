'''Ghazipur''' is a city in the state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], India. Ghazipur city is the administrative headquarters of the [[Ghazipur district]], one of the four districts that form the [[Varanasi division]] of Uttar Pradesh. It is located on the Ganges (Ganga) River near the border with Bihar state, about 40 miles (65 km) northeast of Varanasi (Benares).
The city of Ghazipur also constitutes one of the seven distinct [[Tahalsidar|tehsils]], or subdivisions, of the Ghazipur district.<ref>"[https://ghazipur.nic.in/tehsil Tehsil | District Ghazipur, Government of Uttar Pradesh | India],"</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Ghazipur, a city established during Tughlaqs|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ghazipur-India}}</ref>

Ghazipur is well known for its [[opium]] factory, established by the [[British East India Company]] in 1820 and still the biggest legal opium factory in the world, producing the drug for the global pharmaceutical industry.<ref name=Paxman>{{cite book|author-link=Jeremy Paxman|first=Jeremy|last=Paxman|title=Empire:What Ruling the World Did to the British|year=2011|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|place=London|chapter=Chapter 3}}</ref> Ghazipur lies close to the Uttar Pradesh-[[Bihar]] border, about {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} east of [[Varanasi]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sir Sayed Ahmad Khan{{!}}Books|url=http://www.sirsyedtoday.org/books/?cid=33}}</ref>

===Prehistory and legendary founding===
According to tradition, Ghazipur was founded in 1330, but the place is probably older.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 158, 96 --> The local tradition that the city was once called "Gadhipura" after a legendary king named Gadhi is probably spurious, but old building fragments found along the riverbank point to the existence of a settlement here, and a mound may represent the site of an old fort.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 196 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909">{{cite book |editor1-last=Nevill |editor1-first=H. R. |title=Ghazipur: A Gazetteer, Being Volume XXIX of the District Gazetteers of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh |date=1909 |publisher=Government Press |location=Allahabad |url=https://archive.org/details/dli.csl.2954 |access-date=19 June 2023}}</ref>{{rp|158, 196}}

The legend behind Ghazipur's foundation in 1330 is that Raja Mandhata, a descendant of the [[Chahamanas of Shakambhari|Chauhan Maharaj]] [[Prithviraj III|Prithviraj Chauhan III]], had founded a fort at nearby [[Kathot]] and ruled a small kingdom from there.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 157 --> His nephew, who was the heir to the throne, abducted a local Muslim young woman, and her mother pleaded for help to the [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim sultan of Delhi]].<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 157 --> As a result, 40 ''[[ghazi (warrior)|ghazi]]''s led by one Sayyid Masud set out to attack Kathot.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 157 --> They took the place by surprise and ended up killing Raja Mandhata.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 157 --> The nephew mustered an army and fought two battles against the ghazis, but was defeated in both.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 157 --> The first battle took place on the bank of the Besu and the other was at the site of Ghazipur.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 157 --> Sayyid Masud, who was now given the title Malik us-Sadat Ghazi, founded a city on the site of the second battle and called it Ghazipur.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 157-8 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|157–8}}

===Early recorded history: 1400s and 1500s===
Legends aside, Ghazipur's first mention in contemporary sources is {{circa}} 1494, when [[Sikandar Lodi]] appointed Nasir Khan Lohani as the city's governor.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 159-60 --> Ghazipur flourished during Nasir Khan's long tenure.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 160 --> A new fort is said to have been built under his rule, replacing an older one at Hamzapur.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 160 --> A wave of immigration from Muslim settlers also began at this point and lasted until the late 1500s.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 160 --> New ''[[muhalla]]''s were built to house them.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 160 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|159–60}}

After Sikandar Lodi died, there was a rival claimant named Muhammad Shah (son of [[Darya Khan Lodi]], the former governor of [[Bihar]]).<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 160 --> At first, Nasir Khan stayed loyal to Sikandar's son [[Ibrahim Lodi]], but he was defeated by an army led by one Mian Mustafa, which then looted Ghazipur.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 160 --> At this point, Nasir Khan sided with Muhammad Shah, who restored him as governor.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 160 --> In 1527, [[Humayun]] led a force to Ghazipur while the main Mughal army under [[Babur]] was at [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]]; Nasir Khan fled, and Humayun occupied Ghazipur without resistance.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 160 --> He was recalled to assist Babur soon after, though, and Nasir Khan resumed control over Ghazipur.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 160 --> Nasir Khan submitted to Babur in person in 1528, after Babur took [[Gwalior]], but Babur did not keep him as governor of Ghazipur.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 160-1 --> Instead, he gave the city to Muhammad Khan Lohani Ghazipuri, a relative of Nasir Khan who had joined Babur's side earlier.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 161 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|160–1}}

During [[Akbar]]'s early rule, Ghazipur was held by [[Ali Quli Khan Zaman]], who also founded the nearby town of [[Zamania]].<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 162 --> Ghazipur does not seem to have been affected by Khan Zaman's first rebellion against Akbar in 1565.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 163 --> During his second revolt, Mughal forces under Jafar Khan Turkman attacked Ghazipur, but Khan Zaman fled.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 163 --> After Khan Zaman's death in battle in 1567, Akbar put Ghazipur under [[Munim Khan]]'s control.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 163 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|162–3}}

In the ''[[Ain-i Akbari]]'', Ghazipur was the capital of a [[sarkar (administrative division)|sarkar]] in [[Allahabad Subah]].<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 164 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|164}}

===Later Mughals===
After the Mughals solidified their control over Bengal, Ghazipur lost most of its political importance, and later sources mention it less.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 166 --> Under [[Shah Jahan]], as well as during [[Aurangzeb]]'s early reign, Nawab Sufi Bahadur was governor of Ghazipur.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 166 --> He was succeeded by Nawab Atiqullah Khan, a native of Ghazipur who remained governor until Aurangzeb's death.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 166 --> Ghazipur does not seem to have been affected by the war between Aurangzeb and [[Shah Shuja (Mughal prince)|Shah Shuja]] in 1567, or by the civil wars following Aurangzeb's death.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 166 --> At some point after [[Farrukhsiyar]]'s death in 1719, ''sarkar'' Ghazipur was part of a large territory granted to one [[Murtaza Khan (18th-century)|Murtaza Khan]] as a ''[[jagir]]''.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 166-7 --> In 1727, Murtaza Khan in turn leased this territory to [[Saadat Ali Khan I]], the first [[Nawab of Awadh]].<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 167 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|166–7}}

===Nawabs of Awadh===
At first, Saadaat Ali Khan sub-leased these territories (Ghazipur, Jaunpur, [[Varanasi|Banaras]], and [[Chunar]]) to his friend Rustam Ali Khan.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 167 --> Rustam Ali Khan had no interest in managing the territories himself, and someone named [[Narayan dynasty#Raja Mansa Ram|Mansa Ram]] ended up becoming the actual administrator.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 167 --> In 1738, Rustam Ali Khan was removed from office.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 167 --> Ghazipur was given to one Sheikh Abdullah, son of Muhammad Qasim, while the remainder was given to Mansa Ram.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 167 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|167}}

[[File:William Hodges - A Mosque at Gazipoor (Ghazipur) - B1978.43.1754 - Yale Center for British Art.jpg|thumb|Drawing of a mosque in Ghazipur, 1781]]
Sheikh Abdullah left several monuments in Ghazipur: the Chihal Satun palace, a mosque and [[imambara]], a masonry tank, and a large garden known as the Nawab's Bagh.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 168 --> Abdullah died in 1744 and was buried in a tomb by the garden.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 168 --> His oldest son, Fazl Ali, was away, so a younger brother named Karamullah was installed as governor instead.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 168 --> Fazl Ali appealed to Nawab [[Safdar Jang]] and, in return for a payment of one [[lakh]] rupees, was allowed to replace Karamullah as governor.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 168 --> Fazl Ali was removed from office in 1747 following complaints of "oppression and misgovernment", and Karamullah was restored, but he died a year later and Fazl Ali became governor again.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 168 --> Fazl Ali was again removed from office in 1754, but after his replacement proved ineffective he was restored for a third term.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 168-9 --> He was removed for the third and final time in 1757, and [[Maharaja Balwant Singh of Benares|Balwant Singh]], son of Mansa Ram, was given control of Ghazipur instead.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 169 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|168–9}}

Ghazipur remained under Balwant Singh's son and successor [[Maharaja Chait Singh|Chait Singh]], but the British deposed him in 1781.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 170 --> His successor, [[Mahip Narayan Singh]], was essentially stripped of all administrative powers by the British, who established Ghazipur district in 1818.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 171 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|170–1}}

There were also quite a lot of [[Qadi|Qazi]]s in the area as well as [[Zamindar]]s.<ref name="indianculture.gov.in">{{cite web | url=https://indianculture.gov.in/gazettes/ghazipur-gazetteer-being-volume-xxix-district-gazetteers-united-provinces-agra-and-oudh | title=Ghazipur: A Gazetteer, being Volume XXIX of the District Gazetteers of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh }}</ref>
Specifically in [[Yusufpur]], a notable family would be the Ansari sheiks who had held such offices from the 1500s all the way till the late 20th century.<ref name="indianculture.gov.in"/> Some notables would be [[Faridul Haq Ansari]], Mushir Haider Ansari, Qazi Nizamul Haq Ansari, Khalid Mustafa Ansari and world famous crime master Mukhtar Ansari also is a well known part of this family.<ref name="indianculture.gov.in"/>

===Scientific Society of Ghazipur===
In 1862, [[Syed Ahmed Khan]] established the [[Scientific Society of Aligarh|Scientific Society of Ghazipur]] (which was later transferred to [[Aligarh]]), the first of its kind in India, to propagate modern Western knowledge of science, technology and industry. It was a departure from the past in the sense that education made a paradigm shift from traditional humanities and related disciplines to the new field of science and agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sirsyedtoday.org/books/?cid=33 |title=Sir Syed Ahmad Khan &#124; Books |publisher=Sirsyedtoday.org |access-date=8 April 2012}}</ref> Some current institution like Technical Education and Research Institute (TERI),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://teripgc.com/about_us.html |title=Technical Education & Research Institute |publisher=Teripgc.com |access-date=8 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409202046/http://www.teripgc.com/about_us.html |archive-date=9 April 2012}}</ref> part of post-graduate college [[PG College Ghazipur]], in the city, takes their inspiration from that first Society.

===Ghazipur at the turn of the 20th century===
At the turn of the 20th century, Ghazipur was described as forming "a narrow belt" along the bank of the Ganges.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 196 --> Ghazipur proper extended for about 5.5&nbsp;km along the river, from Khudaipura in the east to Pirnagar in the west; and about 1.5&nbsp;km on the other axis, away from the river.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 196 --> West of Pirnagar was the large former [[cantonment]] area, which extended for another 4&nbsp;km along the river.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 196 --> The main business quarter was along the riverfront, while most houses were away from the river.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 196 --> The town was described as generally rather poor, and its streets were winding and narrow.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 196 --> The riverfront, on the other hand, was described as "picturesque", with a number of masonry [[ghat]]s.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 196 --> On the west was Amghat, where the opium factory was located; other ghats further downstream included Collector Ghat, Pakka Ghat, Mahaul Ghat, Gola Ghat, Chitnath Ghat, Natkha Ghat, Khirki Ghat, and Pushta Ghat.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 199-200 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|196–200}}

The main road was the one coming in from Varanasi to the west.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 199 --> It went due east for about 1&nbsp;km after entering the city, and this stretch was flanked by houses and shops on both sides.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 199 --> Near the entrance, it passed the tank and tomb of Pahar Khan; then the Bishesharganj marketplace; then the Qila Kohna, or old fort; and then the [[dispensary]], which was built in 1881 atop an old mound that may represent an even earlier fort.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 196, 9 --> Beyond this, the road passed through the Lal Darwaza neighbourhood, past the town's ''[[caravanserai|sarai]]'', and past the town hall (built in 1878) and adjoining mosque.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 199-200 --> Past this was the police station, and after that was Martinganj, a marketplace named after a former British official.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 200 --> After this point, the road bent sharply to the left, away from the river, for about 200&nbsp;m.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 200 --> It then bent to the east to run parallel with the river.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 200 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|196–200}}

In this area was a major triple junction at Ghazi Mian, where the Varanasi road met with two others: one coming from [[Korantadih]] and [[Ballia]] to the east and another coming from [[Gorakhpur]] and [[Azamgarh]] in the north.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 195, 9 --> From Ghazi Mian, a wide highway went south to the riverbank at Pushta Ghat, where a ferry crossed over to Tari Ghat on the other side.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 195, 9 --> The [[Ghazipur City railway station]] was also near Ghazi Mian.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 195 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|195, 9}}

The main landmark along the main road in the Ghazi Mian area was the Chihal Satun, or "hall of forty pillars", which was built by Abdullah Khan in the mid-1700s.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 200 --> The main road continued east through Razaganj and Begampur to the [[Ghazipur Ghat railway station]] on the eastern city limit.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 200 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|200}}

Meanwhile, across from the Chihal Satun, another major road split off toward the northeast, passing the [[congregational mosque|Jami Masjid]] and "the Nawab's garden, tank, and tomb" before joining the Korantadih and Ballia road, which then marked the city's northern boundary.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 200 --> Near this point were the garden of Karimullah and the tank of Dharam Chand.<!-- Gazetteer 1909, p. 200 --><ref name="Gazetteer 1909"/>{{rp|200}}

==Places of interest==
Sights in the city include several monuments built by [[Nawab Sheikh Abdullah|Nawab Sheikh Abdulla]], or Abdullah Khan, a governor of Ghazipur during the [[Mughal Empire]] in the eighteenth century, and his son. These include the palace known as Chihal Satun, or "forty pillars", which retains a very impressive gateway although the palace is in ruins, and the large garden with a [[Temple tank|tank]] and a tomb called the Nawab-ki-Chahar-diwari.<ref name="PlacesOfInterest" /><ref name="Hunter">{{cite book |last = Hunter | first = William Wilson | author-link = William Wilson Hunter | year = 1908 | title = The Imperial Gazetteer of India | volume = XII | publisher = Clarendon Press | place = Oxford | pages = 230–231}}</ref> The road that starts at the Nawab-ki-Chahar-diwari tomb and runs past the mosque leads, after 10&nbsp;km, to a [[matha]] devoted to [[Pavhari Baba]].<ref name="PlacesOfInterest" /> The tank and tomb of Pahar Khan, [[faujdar]] of the city in 1580, and the plain but ancient tombs of the founder, Masud, and his son are also in Ghazipur, as is the tomb of [[Lord Cornwallis]], one of the major figures of Indian and British history.<ref name="Fuhrer">{{cite book |last = Führer | first = Alois Anton | author-link = Anton Alois Führer | year = 1891 | title = Archaeological Survey of India: The Monumental Antiquities and Inscriptions in the North-Western Province and Oudh | volume = XII | publisher = Superintendent, Government Press | place = Allahabad | page = 231}}</ref>

Cornwallis is famous for his role in the [[American Revolutionary War]], and then for [[Cornwallis in India|his time as Governor-General of India]], being said to have laid the true foundation of British rule. He was later Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, there suppressing the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 Rebellion]] and establishing the [[Acts of Union 1800|Act of Union]]. He died in Ghazipur in 1805, soon after his returning to India for his second appointment as Governor-General. His tomb, overlooking the Ganges, is a heavy dome supported on 12 Doric columns above a cenotaph carved by [[John Flaxman]].<ref name="Hunter" />

The remains of an ancient mud fort also overlook the river, while there are [[ghat]]s leading to the Ganges, the oldest of which is the ChitNath Ghat.<ref name="PlacesOfInterest" /><ref name="Fuhrer" /> 
Close to ChitNath Ghat, [[Pavhari Baba]] ashram<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amarujala.com/uttar-pradesh/ghazipur/51539279751-ghazipur-news|title = गाजीपुर के दो आश्रम आध्यात्मिक सर्किट में शामिल}}</ref> is a place of interest for [[Swami Vivekananda]] followers. This ashram is further from the original [[Pavhari Baba]] underground [[hermitage (religious retreat)|hermitage]] caves, and is somewhat less explored by tourists. Those are the caves where [[Pavhari Baba]], whom [[Swami Vivekananda]] considered only 2nd to his guru Ramkrishna,<ref>https://www.yousigma.com/biographies/CompleteWorksOfSwamiVivekanandaVolume9.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref> used to meditate, sometimes, as the folklores go, feeding only on air (hence the name Pavhari Baba).

===Ghazipur opium factory===
The opium factory located in the city was established by the British and continues to be a major source of opium production in India. It is known as the Opium Factory Ghazipur or, more formally, the Government [[Opium and Alkaloid Works]]. It is the largest factory of its kind in the country and indeed the world.<ref name="ghosh">{{cite news|work=[[BBC News]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7460682.stm|title=Opium financed British rule in India (interview with Amitav Ghosh)|date=23 June 2008|access-date=26 March 2013}}</ref> The factory was initially run by the [[East India Company]] and was used by the British during the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s with China.<ref name="Paxman" /> The factory as such was founded in 1820 though the British had been trading Ghazipur opium before that. Nowadays its output is controlled by the Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substance Act and Rules (1985) and administratively by the Indian government [[Ministry of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]], overseen by a committee and a [[Indian Civil Accounts Service|Chief Controller]].<ref name="bihartimes">{{cite news|url=http://www.bihartimes.in/articles/amarnath/opium.html |title=A Visit to Gazipur Factory...A sea of surprise |work=[[Bihar Times]] |access-date=26 March 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325064212/http://www.bihartimes.in/articles/amarnath/opium.html |archive-date=25 March 2013}}</ref> The factory's output serves the global pharmaceutical industry. Until 1943 the factory only produced raw opium extracts from [[Poppy|poppies]], but nowadays it also produces many alkaloids, having first begun alkaloid production during World War II to meet military medical needs.<ref name="bihartimes" /> Its annual turnover is in the region of 2&nbsp;billion rupees (approximately 36 or 37 million US dollars), for a profit of about 80&nbsp;million rupees (1.5&nbsp;million dollars).<ref name="bihartimes" /> It has been profitable every year since 1820, but the alkaloid production currently makes a loss, while the opium production makes a profit. The typical annual opium export from the factory to the US, for example, would be about 360 tonnes of opium.<ref name="bihartimes" />
As well as the opium and alkaloid production, the factory also has a significant R&D program, employing up to 50 research chemists.<ref name="bihartimes" /> It also serves the unusual role of being the secure repository for illegal opium seizures in India—and correspondingly, an important office of the [[Narcotics Control Bureau]] of India is located in Ghazipur.<ref name="bihartimes" /> Overall employment in the factory is about 900. Because it is a government industry, the factory is administered from New Delhi but a general manager oversees operations in Ghazipur.<ref name="bihartimes" />
In keeping with the sensitive nature of its production, the factory is guarded under high security (by the [[Central Industrial Security Force]]), and not easily accessible to the general public.<ref name="bihartimes" /> The factory has its own residential accommodation for its employees, and is situated across the banks of river Ganges from the main city of Ghazipur. It is surrounded by high walls topped with barbed wire. Its products are taken by high security rail to Mumbai or New Delhi for further export.<ref name="bihartimes" />

The factory covers about 43 acres and much of its architecture is in red brick, dating from colonial times. Within the grounds of the factory there is a temple to [[Baba Shyam]] and a [[Mazar (mausoleum)|mazar]], both said to predate the factory.<ref name="bihartimes" /> There is also a solar clock, installed by the British opium agent Hopkins Esor from 1911 to 1913.<ref name="bihartimes" /> [[Rudyard Kipling]], who was familiar with opium both medicinally and recreationally,<ref name=kipling>{{cite web|url=http://www.kipling.org.uk/rg_opium1.htm|access-date=26 March 2013|title=In an Opium Factory|first=David|last=Page|date = 5 July 2008|publisher=The New Readers' Guide to the works of Rudyard Kipling|editor=John Radcliffe}}</ref> visited the Ghazipur factory in 1888 and published a description of its workings in ''[[The Pioneer (India)|The Pioneer]]'' on 16 April 1888.<ref name="kipling" /> The text, ''In an Opium Factory'' is freely available from Adelaide University's ebook library.<ref name=adelaide>{{cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kipling/rudyard/opium/complete.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309092008/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/k/kipling/rudyard/opium/complete.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=9 March 2011|publisher=eBooks@Adelaide, The University of Adelaide|date=21 October 2012|access-date=26 March 2013|first=Rudyard|last=Kipling|title=In an Opium Factory|editor=Steve Thomas}}</ref>

[[Amitav Ghosh]]'s novel ''[[Sea of Poppies]]'' deals with the British opium trade in India and much of Ghosh's story is based on his research of the Ghazipur factory. In interview, Ghosh stresses how much of the wealth of the British Empire stemmed from the often unsavoury opium trade, with Ghazipur as one of its centers, but he is also amazed at the scale of the present-day operation.<ref name="ghosh" />

The Ghazipur Opium Factory may have one more claim to fame, for a rather unusual problem it has. It is infested with monkeys, but these are too narcotic-addled to be a real problem and workers drag them out of the way by their tails.<ref name="Paxman" /><ref name="ghosh" /><ref name="photoessay">{{cite book|first=Pablo|last=Bartholomew|title=Photo Essay on Cultivation of Opium in India|chapter=The Opium Trail|publisher=The Indian Economy Overview}}</ref>
