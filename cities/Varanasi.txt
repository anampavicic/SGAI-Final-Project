Rightly so, the baton must then pass on to an all new chronicling of the place.  Yet, a connecting link, as always, may come into play, between the book's time and other times of Banaras.  Let me give an example of what such a connection might look like.  Jonathan Parry (1994) in his classic ''Death in Banaras'' laments in the preface to the book that he could not incorporate the coming in of the electric crematorium in his descriptions of the funerary organization in Banaras.  Two decades later into my fieldwork, I found that it is in part, the efficiency of the open-air, manual cremation that Parry so effectively captures in his book that explains how a promising symbol of industrial modernity, the electric crematorium, falls short of the typecast. In the years between his book and my fieldwork, the electric crematorium sat lonely and was sparingly used against the cheer of the always-on, busy, manual pyres whose flames continue to dot the scene of the ghats in a contrasting relief. In this above sense, I believe, Parry already provides us a portrait of the electric crematorium's social imaginary in Banaras.  The question of the shift from wooden pyres to the electric crematorium is then not about competing technologies but that of ethics with which the dead are tended to amidst the assemblies of funeral travellers.}}</ref>{{efn|This is the case at the same time as traditions have been transformed in the face of modernisation, generational changes and emigration.<ref name=garces-foley-varanasi>{{citation|last=Garces-Foley|first=Kathleen|chapter=At the Intersection of Death and Religion|title=Death and Religion in a Changing World|editor-last=Garces-Foley|editor-first=Kathleen|location=London and New York|publisher=Routledge|year=2022|edition=2|page=186|isbn=978-0-367-64930-2|doi=10.4324/9781003126997|quote=It is not uncommon for immigrants to discover that their long-established death practices are deemed unacceptable by civil authorities in their new home.

Rather, ... the narrative needs to encompass colonial India’s two main metropolises, Bombay (Mumbai) and Calcutta (Kolkata), as well as the movement of Indians overseas and their memorialization abroad. ... The history of cremation in India is far more than the history of traditional rites and practices that it is conventionally taken to be—if tradition is assumed to mean “timeless” custom and immutable belief. On the contrary, cremation in modern India and across the South Asian diaspora is a history of contestation and change, of longing and denial, adaptation and innovation. India, too, has gifted to the world a modern cremation movement, though its meaning, form, and global resonance necessarily differed substantially from the Western cremation movement with which it was nearly contemporaneous.}}</ref>}}  The city has a syncretic tradition of Islamic artisanship that underpins its religious tourism.<ref name="combined-muslim-weaver">*{{cite book | last = Williams | first = Philippa | chapter = Working Narratives of Intercommunity Harmony in Varanasi's Silk Sari Industry| publisher = SAGE | title = Development Failure and Identity Politics in Uttar Pradesh| date = 17 January 2019 |editor1-last=Jeffrey | editor1-first=Roger|editor2-last=Jeffrey | editor2-first = Craig | editor3-last=Lerche | editor3-first=Jens|isbn =  978-81-321-1663-9| pages = 211&ndash;238| quote = 'Varanasi … is the city where Hindus and Muslims … are interwoven like threads as in the lovely silk saris for which Kashi (Varanasi) is so famous for (Puniyani, 2006).'(quoted) Varanasi is most often represented as a sacred Hindu pilgrimage centre (see Eck, 1983), as its social and cultural urban spaces have been often examined through the imagined and lived realities of Hinduism (Hertel and Humes, 1993; Parry, 1994; Singh and Rana, 2002). But it is also home to a sizeable Muslim population, which in 2001 comprised 30 per cent of the city’s residents, significantly more than the percentage of Muslims in UP (Census of India, 2001). Unlike the city’s majority Hindu inhabitants (63 per cent), who occupy a range of occupations in different economic sectors, Muslims in the city are predominantly involved in the production of silk fabrics, as well as other smaller artisanal industries (see Kumar, 1988). Muslims first settled in Varanasi in the eleventh century, when, following the defeat of an invading Muslim army, women, children and civilians were permitted to remain on the northern side of the city and serve the Hindu kings. Many learned the craft of weaving, incorporating their skills and designs into the fabrics. Jean-Baptiste Tavernier, the French explorer and cultural anthropologist, visited Varanasi between 1660 and 1665 and reported that in the courtyard of a rest house in the Chowk area the trading of ''reshmi'' (silk) and ''suti''  (cotton) fabrics was taking place between Muslim ''karigars'' (artisans or craftsmen) and Hindu Mahajans (traders)}}

He praised not only Hindu but also Muslim cultural figures, including the musician Bismillah Khan, and said Khan was arguably the greatest symbol of Ganga-Jamuni tehzeeb (Ganga-Yamuna culture), a riverine phrase often used to describe the intertwined Hindu-Muslim culture of north India where those two rivers flow. Modi also targeted the important Muslim community of sari weavers in the district of Lallapura. Varanasi’s silk wedding saris, lavishly designed and interwoven with gold thread, are much sought after by Indians from across the country and from overseas, and Modi promised to help the weavers acquire modern technology, quality raw materials and better marketing skills so they could compete with Chinese clothing manufacturers. ‘The weavers of Varanasi are an integral part of the city’s history', he wrote in a blog post on his nomination day. ‘It is my resolve to ensure that they stand on their own feet with pride and their future generations have a bright future.’ (pp. 51&ndash;52) An earlier great poet, son of Varanasi and symbol of north India’s syncretic traditions, was the fifteenth-century Kabir, whose pithy lines in Hindi are still much quoted today by Indians over social media. Again, the legends surrounding his life are confused. He may have been born into a low-caste Muslim community of weavers or been a Hindu by birth. But he famously mocked the priesthoods and the rituals of both Muslims and Hindus, even to the extent of deliberately leaving holy Varanasi to die in an obscure town, when most north Indians would be heading in the other direction and yearning to expire within the boundaries of the city to find salvation. His contempt for organized religion is reflected in the legend of his death: Hindu and Muslim devotees argued over who should claim the poet’s remains, but when the cloth covering his body was lifted, they found nothing underneath but a spray of flowers.

[[Silk weaving in Varanasi|Silk weaving]], carpets, crafts and tourism employ a significant number of the local population, as do the [[Banaras Locomotive Works]] and [[Bharat Heavy Electricals]]. The city is known worldwide for its many [[Ghats in Varanasi|ghats]], steps leading down the steep river bank to the water, where pilgrims perform rituals. Of particular note are the [[Dashashwamedh Ghat]], the Panchganga Ghat, the [[Manikarnika Ghat]], and the Harishchandra Ghat, the last two being where Hindus cremate their dead. The [[Hindu genealogy registers at Varanasi]] are kept here. Among the notable temples in Varanasi are the [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] of [[Shiva]], the [[Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple]], and the [[Durga Mandir, Varanasi|Durga Temple]].

The city has long been an educational and musical centre: many prominent Indian philosophers, poets, writers, and musicians live or have lived in the city, and it was the place where the [[Benares gharana]] form of [[Hindustani classical music]] was developed. In the 20th-century, the [[Hindi-Urdu]] writer [[Premchand]] and the [[shehnai]] player [[Bismillah Khan]] were associated with the city. India's oldest [[Sanskrit]] college, the [[Sampurnanand Sanskrit Vishwavidyalaya|Benares Sanskrit College]], was founded by [[Jonathan Duncan (Governor of Bombay)|Jonathan Duncan]], the resident of the [[East India Company]] in 1791. Later, education in Benares was greatly influenced by the rise of [[Indian independence movement|Indian nationalism]] in the late 19th-century. [[Annie Besant]] founded the [[Central Hindu College]] in 1898. In 1916, she and [[Madan Mohan Malviya]] founded the [[Banaras Hindu University]], India's first modern residential university.

==Etymology==
Traditional etymology links "Varanasi" to the names of two Ganges tributaries forming the city's borders: [[Varuna River|Varuna]], still flowing in northern Varanasi, and Assi, today a small stream in the southern part of the city, near Assi Ghat. The old city is located on the north shores of the Ganges, bounded by Varuna and Assi.{{Sfn|Cunningham|Sastri|2002|pp=131–140}}

==History==
===Mythology===
According to [[Hindu mythology]], Varanasi was founded by [[Shiva]],{{sfn|Melton|2007|p=29}} one of [[Trimurti|three principal deities]] along with [[Brahma]] and [[Vishnu]]. During a conflict between Brahma and Shiva, one of Brahma's five heads was torn off by Shiva. As was the custom, the victor carried the slain adversary's head in his hand and let it hang down from his hand as an act of ignominy, and a sign of his own bravery. A bridle was also put into the mouth. Shiva thus dishonoured Brahma's head, and kept it with him at all times. When he came to the city of Varanasi in this state, the hanging head of Brahma dropped from Shiva's hand and disappeared in the ground. Varanasi is therefore considered an extremely holy site.<ref>[[Edward Sachau]], 1910, [http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html ''Alberuni's India''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180303145703/http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/digital/collections/cul/texts/ldpd_5949073_002/pages/ldpd_5949073_002_00000155.html |date=3 March 2018}}, p. 147, London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co.

Rev. [[M. A.

{{Blockquote|The history of a country is sometimes epitomised in the history of one of its principal cities.

Benares became a princely state in 1911,<ref name="Benares Princely State"/> with [[Ramnagar, Varanasi|Ramnagar]] as its capital, but with no jurisdiction over the city proper.

[[Annie Besant]] founded the [[Central Hindu School|Central Hindu College]], which later became a foundation for the creation of [[Banaras Hindu University]] in 1916.

===Geography===
Varanasi is located at an elevation of {{Convert|80.71|m}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://varanasi.nic.in/default.htm|title=DEO Varanasi|work=Tourist Information: General Information|publisher=Varanasi District Administration by National Informatics Centre |url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628050118/http://varanasi.nic.in/default.htm|archive-date=28 June 2011}}</ref> in the centre of the Ganges valley of [[North India]], in the Eastern part of the state of Uttar Pradesh, along the left crescent-shaped bank of the Ganges, averaging between {{convert|50|ft|order=flip}} and {{convert|70|ft|order=flip}} above the river.{{Sfn|Mohanty|1993|p=316}} The city is the headquarters of [[Varanasi district]]. By road, Varanasi is located {{convert|797|km}} south-east of [[New Delhi]], {{convert|320|km}} south-east of [[Lucknow]], {{convert|121|km}} east of [[Prayagraj]], and {{convert|63|km}} south of [[Jaunpur, Uttar Pradesh|Jaunpur]].<ref name="GM">{{cite map|title= Maps|publisher=[[Google Maps]]}}</ref> The "Varanasi Urban Agglomeration" – an agglomeration of seven urban sub-units – covers an area of {{cvt|112|km2}}.<ref name=heritageUNESCO>{{cite web |url=http://www.sasnet.lu.se/EASASpapers/46RanaSingh.pdf |title=Varanasi as Heritage City (India) on the scale the UNESCO World Heritage List: From Contestation to Conservation |access-date=18 August 2006 |last=Singh |first=Rana P.B. |work=EASAS papers |publisher=Swedish South Asian Studies Network |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716102421/http://www.sasnet.lu.se/EASASpapers/46RanaSingh.pdf |archive-date=16 July 2011}}</ref> Neighbourhoods of the city include Adampura, Anandbagh, Bachchhaon, Bangali Tola, Bhelpura, Bulanala, Chaitganj, Chaukaghat, Chowk, Dhupchandi, Dumraon, Gandhinagar, Gautam Nagar, Giri Nagar, Gopal Vihar, Guru Nanak Nagar, Jaitpura, Kail Garh, Khanna, Kotwali, Lanka Manduadih, Luxa, Maheshpur, Mahmoorganj, Maulvibagh, Nagwar, Naipokhari, Shivala, Siddhagiribagh, and Sigra.<ref name="GM" />

Located in the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]]s of North India, the land is very fertile because low-level floods in the Ganges continually replenish the soil.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Indo-Gangetic-Plain|title=Indo-Gangetic Plain|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica|access-date=26 December 2018|archive-date=26 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181226134743/https://www.britannica.com/place/Indo-Gangetic-Plain|url-status=live}}</ref> Varanasi is situated between the Ganges confluences with two rivers: the Varuna and the Assi stream. The distance between the two confluences is around {{convert|4|km|mi|order=flip|0}}, and serves as a sacred journeying route for Hindus, which culminates with a visit to a Sakshi Vinayak Temple.{{Sfn|Kishore|2008|p=65}}

===Climate===
Varanasi experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwa'') with large variations between summer and winter temperatures.{{Sfn|Singh|1975|p=4}}<!--Singh supports Cwa classification-->{{Sfn|Pandey|1989|p=13}} The dry summer starts in April and lasts until June, followed by the monsoon season from July to October. The temperature ranges between {{convert|22|and|46|C|F|0}} in the summers. Winters in Varanasi see very large [[diurnal cycle|diurnal]] variations, with warm days and downright cold nights. Cold waves from the [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] region cause temperatures to dip across the city in the winter from December to February and temperatures below {{convert|5|C|F|0|abbr=on}} are not uncommon. The average annual rainfall is {{convert|1110|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Fog is common in the winters, while hot dry winds, called [[Loo (wind)|loo]], blow in the summers.{{Sfn|Singh|Rana|2002|p=27}} In recent years, the water level of the Ganges has decreased significantly; upstream dams, unregulated water extraction, and dwindling glacial sources due to global warming may be to blame.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aninews.in/newsdetail2/story39530/is-river-ganges-drying-in-varanasi.html |title=Is River Ganges drying in Varanasi |publisher=Aninews.in |access-date=3 November 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512213923/http://aninews.in/newsdetail2/story39530/is-river-ganges-drying-in-varanasi.html |archive-date=12 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/ganges-receding-despite-rainfall/story-e6frg6so-1226066738979 | work=The Australian | title=Ganges receding despite rainfall | date=1 June 2011}}</ref>

Because of the high population density of Varanasi and the increasing number of tourists, the Uttar Pradesh government and international non-governmental organisations and institutions have expressed grave concern for the pollution and pressures on infrastructure in the city, mainly the sewage, sanitation, and drainage components.{{Sfn|Mohanty|1993|p=316-7}} [[Pollution of the Ganges]] is a particular source of worry because of the religious significance of the river, the dependence of people on it as a source of drinking water, and its prominence as a symbol of Varanasi and the city itself.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fore.yale.edu/news/item/indians-keep-faith-with-ganges-despite-pollution/ |title=News &#124; The Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale |first=Yasmeen |last=Mohiuddin |work=fore.yale.edu |date=2010 |access-date=4 August 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151018001045/http://fore.yale.edu/news/item/indians-keep-faith-with-ganges-despite-pollution/ |archive-date=18 October 2015}}</ref> The sewage problem is exacerbated by the role of the Ganges in bathing and in river traffic, which is very difficult to control.{{Sfn|Mohanty|1993|p=316-7}} Because of the sewage, people using local untreated water have higher risk of contracting a range of water-borne stomach diseases.<ref name="HamnerTripathi2006">{{cite journal|last1=Hamner|first1=Steve|last2=Tripathi|first2=Anshuman|last3=Mishra|first3=Rajesh Kumar|last4=Bouskill|first4=Nik|last5=Broadaway|first5=Susan C.|last6=Pyle|first6=Barry H.|last7=Ford|first7=Timothy E.|s2cid=23264273|title=The role of water use patterns and sewage pollution in incidence of water-borne/enteric diseases along the Ganges river in Varanasi, India|journal=International Journal of Environmental Health Research|volume=16|issue=2|year=2006|pages=113–32|issn=0960-3123|doi=10.1080/09603120500538226|pmid=16546805|bibcode=2006IJEHR..16..113H }}</ref>

According to the 2006 City Development Plan for Varanasi, approximately 29% of Varanasi's population is employed.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=29}} Approximately 40% are employed in manufacturing, 26% work in trade and commerce, 19% work in other services, 8% work in transport and communication, 4% work in agriculture, 2% work in construction, and 2% are marginal workers (working for less than half of the year).{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=28}}

Among manufacturing workers, 51% work in spinning and weaving, 15% work in metal, 6% work in printing and publishing, 5% work in electrical machinery, and the rest work in a wide variety of industry sectors.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=31}} Varanasi's manufacturing industry is not well developed and is dominated by small-scale industries and household production.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=29}}[[File:Banarasi sari pallu by ashish4.JPG|thumb|left|[[Banarasi sari]]]] [[Silk weaving in Varanasi|Silk weaving]] is the dominant industry in Varanasi.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|pp=29–31}} Muslims are the influential community in this industry with nearly half a million of them working as weavers, dyers, sari finishers, and salespersons.{{Sfn|Warikoo|2010|p=192}} Weaving is typically done within the household, and most weavers are [[Momin Ansari]] Muslims.{{Sfn|Wood|2011|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=9Fq4eUi_3oMC&pg=PA113 113]}} Varanasi is known throughout India for its production of very fine silk and [[Banarasi sari]]s, brocades with gold and silver thread work, which are often used for weddings and special occasions. The production of silk often uses bonded child labour, though perhaps not at a higher rate than elsewhere in India.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Small Hands of Slavery: Bonded Child Labor in India|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|year=1996|isbn=978-1-56432-172-5|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NfX3sRoJ3rYC&pg=PA82 82]|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NfX3sRoJ3rYC|access-date=6 March 2016|archive-date=4 April 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404134617/https://books.google.com/books?id=NfX3sRoJ3rYC|url-status=live}}</ref> The silk weaving industry has recently been threatened by the rise of power looms and computer-generated designs and by competition from Chinese silk imports.{{Sfn|JNNURM|2006|p=29}} Trade Facilitation Centre is a modern and integrated facility to support the handloom and handicraft sector in Varanasi; providing trade enhancement and facilitation to both domestic and international buyers.

===Ramnagar Fort===
[[File:Ramnagar Fort in Varanasi.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramnagar Fort]] was built in 1750 by [[Kashi Naresh]] Raja [[Balwant Singh of Benares|Balwant Singh]].]]

The Ramnagar Fort, located near the Ganges on its eastern bank and opposite the Tulsi Ghat, was built in the 18th century by Kashi Naresh Raja Balwant Singh with cream-coloured ''chunar'' [[sandstone]]. The fort is a typical example of the [[Mughal architecture]] with carved balconies, open courtyards, and scenic pavilions. At present, the fort is in disrepair. The fort and its museum are the repository of the history of the kings of Benares. Cited as an "eccentric" museum, it contains a rare collection of American [[vintage car]]s, bejewelled [[Litter (vehicle)|sedan chairs]], an impressive weaponry hall, and a rare astrological clock.<ref name=Ram>{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/uttar-pradesh/varanasi/sights/museum/ramnagar-fort-museum|title=Lonely Planet review for Ramnagar Fort & Museum|access-date=6 November 2012|publisher=Lonely Planet|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616061730/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/uttar-pradesh/varanasi/sights/museum/ramnagar-fort-museum|archive-date=16 June 2012}}</ref> In addition, manuscripts, especially religious writings, are housed in the Saraswati Bhawan which is a part of a museum within the fort. Many books illustrated in the [[Mughal painting|Mughal miniature]] style are also part of the collections. Because of its scenic location on the banks of the Ganges, it is frequently used as an outdoor shooting location for films.<ref name= Ram />{{Sfn|Mitra|2002|pp=124–127}}

===Ghats===

The Ghats in Varanasi are world-renowned embankments made in steps of stone slabs along the river bank where pilgrims perform ritual ablutions.<ref>David Scheinbaum.

Many ghats are associated with Hindu legends and several are now privately owned.{{Sfn|Bansal|2008|pp=34–35}}

Many of the ghats were constructed under the patronage of the Marathas like [[Scindia]]s, [[House of Holkar|Holkars]], [[Bhonsle]]s, and [[Peshwa]]s. Most are bathing ghats, while others are used as cremation sites. A morning boat ride on the Ganges across the ghats is a popular tourist attraction. The extensive stretches of ghats in Varanasi enhance the riverfront with a multitude of shrines, temples, and palaces built "tier on the tier above the water's edge".{{Sfn| Pletcher|2010|pp=159–160}}

'''The [[Dashashwamedh Ghat]]''' is the main and probably the oldest ghat of Varanasi located on the Ganges, close to the Kashi Vishwanath Temple.{{Citation needed|date=August 2023}} [[File:DashashwamedhGhat-Varanasi India-Andres Larin.jpg|thumb|right|Drone shot of a Dashashwamedh Ghat in 2022]]It is believed that [[Brahma]] created this ghat to welcome Shiva and sacrificed ten horses during the ''Dasa-[[Ashwamedha]] [[yajna]]'' performed there. Above and adjacent to this ghat, there are also temples dedicated to Sulatankesvara, Brahmesvara, Varahesvara, Abhaya Vinayaka, Ganga (the Ganges), and Bandi Devi, which are all important pilgrimage sites. A group of priests performs "Agni Pooja" (Sanskrit: "Worship of Fire") daily in the evening at this ghat as a dedication to Shiva, Ganga, [[Surya]] (Sun), [[Agni]] (Fire), and the entire universe. Special [[aarti]]s are held on Tuesdays and on religious festivals.<ref name=ghats />

'''The [[Manikarnika Ghat]]''' is the Mahasmasana, the primary site for Hindu cremation in the city. Adjoining the ghat, there are raised platforms that are used for death anniversary rituals. According to a myth, it is said that an earring of Shiva or his wife [[Sati (Hindu goddess)|Sati]] fell here. Fourth-century [[Gupta Empire|Gupta period]] inscriptions mention this ghat. However, the current ghat as a permanent riverside embankment was built in 1302 and has been renovated at least three times throughout its existence.<ref name=ghats />

'''The Jain Ghat''' is believed to birthplace of [[Suparshvanatha]] (7th Tirthankara) and [[Parshvanatha]] (23rd tirthankara). The Jain Ghat or Bachraj Ghat is a Jain Ghat and has three Jain Temples located on the banks of the River. It is believed that the Jain Maharajas used to own these ghats. Bachraj Ghat has three Jain temples near the river's banks, and one them is a very ancient temple of Tirthankara Suparswanath.{{Citation needed|date=August 2023}}

===Mosques===
[[File:Alamgir Mosque by the Ganges ghats, Varanasi.jpg|thumb|[[Alamgir Mosque, Varanasi|Alamgiri Mosque]]]]

There are 15 mosques of significant historical value in Varanasi. Of particular note are the Abdul Razzaq, Alamgir, Bibi Razia, Chaukhambha, Dhai Nim Kangore, Fatman, Ganje Shahada, Gyanavapi, and Hazrat Sayyed Salar Masud Dargah. Many of these mosques were constructed from the components of the Hindu shrines which were destroyed under the auspices of subsequent Muslim invaders or rulers. The two such well known mosques are the [[Gyanvapi Mosque]] and the [[Alamgir Mosque]].{{Sfn|Out|2010|p=259}}

The Gyanvapi Mosque was built by the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb in 1664 CE, after destroying a Hindu temple.{{Sfn|Desai|2003|p=23}} ''Gyan Vapi'' (Sanskrit: "the well of knowledge"), the name of the mosque, is derived from a well of the same name located within the precincts of the mosque.{{Sfn|Mitra|2002|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NviJaunGDJMC&pg=PA95 95]}} The remains of an erstwhile temple can be seen in the foundation, the columns and at the rear part of the mosque.{{Sfn|Betts|McCulloch|2013|p=213}} The façade of the mosque is modelled partially on the [[Taj Mahal]]'s entrance.{{sfn|Asher|1992|p=278}} The mosque is administered by the Anjuman Inthazamiya Masajid (AIM).<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Frontline |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IqhKAQAAIAAJ |title=VHP game in Benares, with official blessings |year=1995 |publisher=S.

The Alamgiri Mosque was built in the 17th century by Aurangzeb over the ruins of a Hindu temple.{{Sfn|Crowther|Raj|Wheeler|1984|p=}} The Hindu temple that was destroyed was dedicated to [[Vishnu]], and had been built by Beni Madhur Rao Scindia, a Maratha chieftain. When emperor Aurangzeb had captured Banaras, he had ordered total destruction of all Hindu temples there. Aurangzeb then built a mosque over the ruins of this temple in 1669{{Sfn|Dunlop|Sykes|Jackson|2001|p=135}} and named it as Alamagir Mosque in the name of his own honorific title "Alamgir" which he had adopted after becoming the emperor of Mughal empire.{{Sfn|Kumar|2003|p=90}}{{Sfn|Betts|McCulloch|2013|p=213}} The mosque is located at a prominent site above the [[Panchganga Ghat]], which is a funerary ghat facing the Ganges.{{Sfn|Hussain|1999|p=342}} The mosque is architecturally a blend of Islamic and Hindu architecture, particularly because of the lower part of the walls of the mosque having been built fully with the remains of the Hindu temple.{{Sfn|Kumar|2003|p=90}} The mosque has high domes and minarets.{{Sfn|Shetty|2014|p=73}}{{Sfn|Betts|McCulloch|2013|p=213}} Two of its minarets had been damaged; one minaret crashed killing a few people and the other minaret was officially brought down because of stability concerns.{{Sfn|Betts|McCulloch|2013|p=213}} Non-Muslims are not allowed to enter the mosque.<ref>{{cite book |title=Fodor's essential India : with Delhi, Rajasthan, Mumbai & Kerala|date=2015|publisher=Fodor's |location=New York|isbn=978-1-101-87868-2}}</ref> The mosque has a security cordon of a police force.{{Sfn|Vit-Suzan|2014|p=11}}

{{Main|Music in Varanasi}}
[[File:Goswami Tulsidas Awadhi Hindi Poet.jpg|thumb|upright|Sant Goswami Tulsidas Awadhi, a Hindi poet and propagator of Bhakthi music in Varanasi]]

Varanasi's music tradition is traced to the [[Puranas|Pauranic]] days. According to ancient legend, Shiva is credited with evolving music and dance forms. During the medieval era, [[Vaishnavism]], a [[Bhakti movement]], grew in popularity, and Varanasi became a thriving centre for musicians such as [[Surdas]], [[Kabir]], [[Ravidas]], [[Meera]] and Tulsidas. During the monarchic rule of Govind Chandra in the 16th century, the [[Dhrupad]] style of singing received royal patronage and led to other related forms of music such as Dhamar, Hori, and Chaturang. Presently the Dhrupad maestro Pandit [[Ritwik Sanyal]] from Varanasi is working for the revival of this art-music.<ref name=Music>{{cite web|url=http://www.varanasicity.com/varanasi-music.html|title=Varanasi Music|access-date=27 May 2013|publisher=Varanasi City.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228013039/http://www.varanasicity.com/varanasi-music.html|archive-date=28 February 2013}}</ref>
