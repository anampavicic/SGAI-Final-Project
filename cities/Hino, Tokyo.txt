==History==
The area of present-day Hino was part of ancient [[Musashi Province]]. During the [[Edo period]], the village of Hino developed as a [[shukuba|post station]] on the [[Kōshū Kaidō]].

In the post-[[Meiji Restoration]] cadastral reform of 1871, Hino-juku became part of [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]. In the reorganization of districts in 1889, Hino-juku came under the jurisdiction of Minamitama District. The entire district was transferred to the control of Tokyo Prefecture on April 1, 1893, at which time Hino-juku was proclaimed Hino Town under the modern municipalities system. The area of the town expanded through annexation of neighboring villages in 1901 and 1958. On November 3, 1963, Hino was elevated to city status.

==Government==
Hino has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Hino contributes two members to the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Tokyo 21st district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
