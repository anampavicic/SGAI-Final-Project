It is the largest city and capital of [[Erzurum Province]] and is 1,900 meters (6,233 feet) above sea level. Erzurum had a population of 367,250 in 2010. It is the site of ancient Theodosiopolis. 

The city uses the [[double-headed eagle]] as its coat-of-arms, a motif that has been a common symbol throughout [[Anatolia]] since the [[Bronze Age]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chariton|first=Jesse David|date=2011|title=The Mesopotamian Origins of the Hittite Double-Headed Eagle|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339213501|journal=UW-L Journal of Undergraduate Research|volume=XIV|via=ResearchGate}}</ref>

== Name and etymology ==
The city was originally known in [[Armenian language|Armenian]] as Karno K'aghak' ({{langx|hy|Կարնոյ քաղաք}}), meaning city of '''Karin''', to distinguish it from the district of Karin ([[wikt:Կարին|Կարին]]).<ref name="EIS"/> It is presumed its name was derived from a local tribe called the Karenitis.<ref name="ASE">{{in lang|hy}} Darbinian, M. "Erzurum," [[Armenian Soviet Encyclopedia]]. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1978, vol. 4, p. 93.</ref> An alternate theory contends that a local princely family, the [[Kamsarakan]]s, the Armenian off-shoot of the Iranian [[House of Karen|Kārin Pahlav family]], lent its name to the locale that eventually became the city.{{sfn|Pourshariati|2017}}

During Roman times, Erzurum was named '''Theodosiopolis''' ({{Langx|la|Theodosiopolis}}, {{langx|el|Θεοδοσιούπολις}}). On the [[Tabula Peutingeriana]] it is called '''Autisparate'''. After the [[Arab conquest of Armenia]] in the seventh century, the city was known to the [[Arab people|Arabs]] as Kālīkalā (adopted from the original [[Armenian language|Armenian]] name Karno K'aghak' ({{langx|hy|Կարնոյ քաղաք}}), meaning 'Karin City', to distinguish it from the district of Karin ([[wikt:Կարին|Կարին]]).<ref name="EIS"/>

It received its present name after its conquest by the [[Seljuk Turks]] following the [[Battle of Manzikert]] in 1071.<ref name="EIS"/> In 1048/49, a neighboring commercial city named [[Artze]] (Arcn, Arzan; Armenian: Արծն) was [[Sack of Artze|heavily sacked]] by the Seljuks.<ref name="EIS">{{EI2|last=Inalcik|first=Halil|author-link=Halil Inalcik|title=Erzurum|volume=2|page=712}}</ref><ref>{{ODB|last=Garsoïan|first=Nina G.|author-link=Nina Garsoïan|title=Theodosioupolis|page=2054}}.</ref> Its [[Armenians|Armenian]], [[Assyrian people|Syrian]], and other Christian inhabitants moved to Theodosiopolis, which they began calling ''Artsn Rum'' (meaning 'Artze of the [[Rûm]]', i.e., [[Rhomaioi|Romans]]) to distinguish it from their former residence.<ref name="Laurent-Canard">See Joseph Laurent's extensive note in his {{in lang|fr}} ''L’Arménie entre Byzance et l’Islam depuis la conquête arabe jusqu’en 886'', 1919, new edition revised and updated by [[Marius Canard]] (Lisbon: Librairie Bertrand, 1980), pp. 87–88, note 83.</ref><ref>{{in lang|de}} Markwart, Joseph.

Some older sources derive the name Erzurum from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] '''Arḍu ar-Rūm''' ({{langx|ar|ارض الروم}}) 'land of the [[Rûm]]'.<ref name="Laurent-Canard"/><ref name="ASE"/>

During the brief period it came under [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgian]] rule,{{when|date=December 2019}} the city was known as Karnu-kalaki ({{lang-ka|კარნუ-ქალაქი}}).<ref>[[Georgian Soviet Encyclopedia]], vol. 5, p. 412, Tb., 1980.</ref>

The following variants of the name also occur: ''Erzerum'', ''Arzrum''.{{Sfn|Wilson|Maunsell|1911}}

{{Further|Erzurum Province#History}}

===Early history===
[[File:Erzurum_Mar_2020_12_14_14_771000.jpeg|thumb|[[Yakutiye Medresesi]] in the city center]]
The surroundings of Erzurum at the [[Urartians|Urartian]] period presumably belonged to [[Diauehi]].<ref>Kemalettin Köroğlu: ''The Northern Border of the Urartian Kingdom.'' In: Altan Çilingiroğlu/G. Darbyshire (Hrsg.): ''Anatolian Iron Ages 5, Proceedings of the 5th Anatolian Iron Ages Colloquium Van.'' 6.–10. August 2001. British Institute of Archaeology at Ankara Monograph 3 (Ankara 2005), p. 101.</ref> 

Later, Erzurum existed under the Armenian name of Karin. During the reigns of the [[Artaxiad]] and [[Arsacid Dynasty of Armenia|Arsacid]] kings of [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Armenia]], Karin served as the capital of the eponymous canton of [[Karin (historic Armenia)|Karin]], in the province Bardzr Hayk' (Upper Armenia).<ref>Hewsen, Robert H. ''Armenia: a Historical Atlas''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2001, p. 103.</ref> After the [[Peace of Acilisene|partition of Armenia]] between the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] and [[Sassanid Persia]] in 387&nbsp;AD, the city passed into the hands of the Romans who fortified the city and renamed it Theodosiopolis, after Emperor [[Theodosius I]].<ref>Garsoïan, Nina G. "The Foundation of Theodosiopolis-Karin" in ''Armenian Karin/Erzerum''. UCLA Armenian History and Culture Series: Historic Armenian Cities and Provinces, 4, ed. [[Richard G. Hovannisian]]. Costa Mesa, CA: Mazda Publishers, 2003, pp. 63–72.</ref> 

As the chief military stronghold along the eastern border of the empire, Theodosiopolis held a highly important strategic location and was fiercely contested in wars between the Byzantines and Persians. Emperors [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius I]] and [[Justinian I]] both refortified the city and built new defenses during their reigns.<ref>{{in lang|hy}} Arakelyan, Babken N. "Hayastani Khoshor Kagh'ak'nere" [The Great Cities of Armenia] in ''Hay Zhoghovrdi Patmutyun'' [History of the Armenian People]. Yerevan: Armenian Academy of Sciences, 1976, vol. 3, p. 232.</ref>

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Erzeron Tournefort.png|thumb|"A Prospect of Erzeron the Capital of Armenia" from [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]]'s 1717 book ''Relation d'un voyage du Levant'']]
[[File:Erzurum, madrasa dei minareti gemelli, 1253 ca., cortile 08,0.jpg|thumb|The [[Sultanate of Rûm|Seljuk]] era [[Çifte Minareli Medrese (Erzurum)|Çifte Minareli Medrese]] (Twin [[Minaret]] [[Madrasa]]) is the symbol of the city and appears on its [[coat of arms]].]]
Theodosiopolis was conquered by the [[Umayyad]] general [[Abdallah ibn Abd al-Malik]] in 700/701. It became the capital of the emirate of Ḳālīḳalā and was used as a base for raids into Byzantine territory. Though only an island of [[Arab]] power within Christian Armenian-populated territory, the native population was generally a reliable client of the Caliph's governors. As the power of the [[Caliphate]] declined, and the resurgence of [[Byzantium]] began, the local [[Armenians|Armenian]] leaders preferred the city to be under the control of powerless Muslim [[emir]]s rather than powerful [[Byzantine emperors]].<ref>Whittow, Mark. ''The Making of Byzantium, 600–1025''. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1996, pp. 310, 320.</ref>

In 931, and again in 949, Byzantine forces led by [[Theophilos Kourkouas]], grandfather of the future emperor [[John I Tzimiskes]], captured Theodosiopolis. Its Arab population was expelled and the city was resettled by Greeks and Armenians.<ref>Whittow. ''The Making of Byzantium'', p. 322.</ref> Emperor [[Basil II]] rebuilt the city and its defenses in 1018 with the help of the local Armenian population.<ref>Arakelyan. "The Great Cities of Armenia", pp. 232–233.</ref> In 1071, after the decisive battle at [[battle of Manzikert|Manzikert]], the [[Seljuk Turks]] took possession of Theodosiopolis. The [[Saltukids]] were rulers of an [[Anatolian beylik]] (principality) centered in Erzurum, who ruled from 1071 to 1202. [[Melike Mama Hatun]], sister of Nâsırüddin Muhammed, was the ruler between 1191 and 1200.

Theodosiopolis repelled many attacks and military campaigns by the Seljuks and [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgians]] (the latter knew the city as Karnu-Kalaki) until 1201 when the city and the province was conquered by the Seljuk sultan [[Süleymanshah II]]. Erzen-Erzurum fell to the Mongol siege in 1242, and the city was looted and devastated. After the fall of the [[Sultanate of Rum]] in early 14th century, it became an administrative province of the [[Ilkhanate]], and later on the city was under [[Empire of Trebizond]] occupation for a while around the 1310s.<ref>Zehiroğlu, Ahmet M.; "Trabzon Imparatorluğu 2" 2016, Trabzon, ({{ISBN|978-605-4567-52-2}}); pp.133–134</ref> Then became part of the Çoban beylik, [[Black Sheep Turkmen]], empire of [[Timur Lenk]] and [[White Sheep Turkmen]]. It subsequently passed to [[Safavid Persia]], until the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]] under [[Selim I]] in 1514 conquered it through the [[Battle of Chaldiran]]. During Ottoman imperial rule, the city served as the main base of military power in the region.

It served as the capital of the [[Erzurum Eyalet|''eyalet'' of Erzurum]]. Early in the seventeenth century, the province was threatened by [[Safavid Persia]] and a revolt by the province governor [[Abaza Mehmed Pasha]]. This revolt was combined with [[Jelali Revolts]] (the uprising of the provincial musketeers called the Jelali), backed by Iran and lasted until 1628. In 1733, Iranian ruler [[Nader Shah]] took Erzurum during the [[Ottoman–Persian War (1730–35)]],<ref>John A Boyle. [https://books.google.com/books?id=JL2NOXXCHPsC&dq=nader+shah+captured+erzurum&pg=PA43 "Persia (RLE Iran A): History and Heritage"] p 43</ref> but the city returned to Ottoman possession following his death in 1747.

===Modern history===
In 1821, during the last major [[Ottoman-Persian Wars|Ottoman-Persian War]], the Ottomans were decisively defeated at Erzurum by the Iranian [[Qajar dynasty|Qajars]] at the [[Battle of Erzurum (1821)]].<ref>''A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle'', Vol.III, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, 1140.</ref> In 1829 the city was [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–29)|captured by the Russian Empire]], but was returned to the [[Ottoman Empire]] under the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] (Edirne), in September of the same year. During the [[Crimean war]] Russian forces approached Erzurum, but did not attack it because of insufficient forces and the continuing Russian siege of [[Kars]]. The city was unsuccessfully attacked ([[Battle of Erzurum (1877)]]) by a Russian army in the [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878|Russo-Ottoman War]] of 1877–78. However, in February 1878, the Russians took Erzurum without resistance, but it was again returned to the [[Ottoman Empire]], this time under the [[Treaty of San Stefano]]. There were massacres of the city's Armenian citizens during the [[Hamidian massacres]] (1894–1896).<ref>[[Vahakn N. Dadrian|Dadrian, Vahakn N]].

[[File:Սանասարեան վարժարան.jpg|thumb|Sanasarian College was one of the premier Armenian educational institutions in Erzurum on the eve of the First World War. Its faculty was murdered during the 1915 [[Armenian genocide|genocide]].]]
The 40,000-strong Armenian population was deported from the city and killed en masse during the 1915 [[Armenian genocide]]. Their cultural institutions, including churches, clubs, and schools, were looted, destroyed, or otherwise left derelict. When Russian forces occupied Erzurum in 1916, there were scarcely 200 Armenians left alive.<ref>Kévorkian, Raymond. ''The Armenian Genocide: A History''. London: I.B. Tauris, 2011, pp. 289-318.</ref>

The city was also the location of [[Battle of Erzurum (1916)|one of the key battles]] in the [[Caucasus Campaign]] of [[World War I]] between the armies of the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Russian Empire]]s. This resulted in the capture of Erzurum by Russian forces under the command of [[Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Grand Duke Nicholas]] and [[Nikolai Nikolaevich Yudenich]] on February 16, 1916. Erzurum reverted to Ottoman control after the signing of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in March 1918. In 1919, [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]], one of the key founders of the modern [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]], resigned from the Ottoman army in Erzurum and was declared an "Honorary Native" and freeman of the city, which issued him his first citizenship registration and certificate (Nüfus Cuzdanı) of the new Turkish Republic. The [[Erzurum Congress]] of 1919 was one of the starting points of the [[Turkish War of Independence]].<ref>See Richard G. Hovannisian, "The Competition for Erzerum, 1914–1921" in ''Armenian Karin/Erzerum'', pp. 378ff.</ref>

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Theodosiopolis was important enough in the Late [[Roman province]] of [[Armenia Tertia]] to become a bishopric, which the [[Annuario Pontificio]] lists as [[suffragan]] of the [[Archdiocese of Comachus]], but in ''Notitiae Episcopatuum'' from the seventh and early tenth centuries, its (later?) Metropolitan is the [[Archdiocese of Caesarea in Cappadocia]].<ref>Heinrich Gelzer, ''Ungedruckte und ungenügend veröffentlichte Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum, in: Abhandlungen der philosophisch-historische classe der bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften'', 1901, p. 536, nº 80, e p. 551, nº 112</ref> In either case, it was in the sway of the [[Patriarchate of Constantinople]].

Its historically recorded Suffragan Bishops were :
* Petrus I, intervening at the council of 448 convoked by Patriarch [[Flavian of Constantinople]] in his see to condemn Archimandrite [[Eutyches]] as a heretic for his extreme opposition to [[Nestorianism]]
* Manasse intervened at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451
* Petrus II participated in the 533 dispute in Constantinople between 'orthodoxy' and [[Monophysitism]]
* As ancient Theodosiopolis in Armenia (or "in Cappadocia"), the former bishopric remains a Latin Catholic [[titular see]].

=== Council of Theodosiopolis (593) ===
After the long [[Byzantine-Sasanian War of 572-591]], Byzantine rule was extended to all western parts of [[Byzantine Armenia|Armenia]], and emperor [[Maurice (emperor)|Maurice]] (582-602) decided to strengthen political control over the region by supporting pro-[[Chalcedonian]] fraction of the Armenian Church. In 593, regional council of western Armenian bishops met in Theodosiopolis, proclaimed allegiance to the [[Chalcedonian Definition]] and elected John (Yovhannes, or Hovhannes) of [[Bagaran (ancient city)|Bagaran]] as new Catholicos of Chalcedonian Armenians.{{sfn|Meyendorff|1989|p=108-109, 284, 343}}

As Ancient '''Theodosiopolis in Armenia''' (or "in Cappadocia"), the former bishopric remains a Latin Catholic [[titular see]], renamed as Titular Archiepiscopal See of Aprus. Its post is vacant since 1968, [[Antonio Gregorio Vuccino]] was its last archbishop.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Titular See of Aprus, Turkey|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t0165.htm|website=GCatholic|access-date=2020-05-27}}</ref>

One of the largest source of income and economic activity in the city has been [[Atatürk University]]. Established in 1950, it is one of the largest universities in Turkey, having more than forty-thousand students. Tourism also provides a portion of the province's revenues. The city is a popular destination in Turkey for [[winter sports]] at the nearby [[Palandöken Mountain]].

Erzurum is notable for the small-scale production of objects crafted from [[Oltu stone]]: most are sold as souvenirs and include prayer beads, bracelets, necklaces, brooches, earrings and hairclips.

For now, Erzurum is the ending point of the [[South Caucasus Pipeline]], also called the ''[[Baku]]-[[Tbilisi]]-Erzurum'' (BTE) pipeline.
