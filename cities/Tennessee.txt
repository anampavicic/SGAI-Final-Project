Tennessee is geographically, culturally, and legally divided into three [[Grand Divisions of Tennessee|Grand Divisions]] of [[East Tennessee|East]], [[Middle Tennessee|Middle]], and [[West Tennessee]]. [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]] is the state's capital and largest city, and anchors its largest metropolitan area. Tennessee has diverse terrain and landforms, and from east to west, contains a mix of cultural features characteristic of [[Appalachia]], the [[Upland South]], and the [[Deep South]]. The [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] along the eastern border reach some of the highest elevations in eastern North America, and the [[Cumberland Plateau]] contains many scenic valleys and [[waterfall]]s. The central part of the state is marked by cavernous bedrock and irregular rolling hills, and level, fertile plains define West Tennessee. The state is twice bisected by the [[Tennessee River]], and the [[Mississippi River]] forms its western border. The [[Great Smoky Mountains National Park]], the nation's most visited national park, is in eastern Tennessee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm |title=Great Smoky Mountains National Park |publisher=National Park Service |access-date=November 25, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091202145003/http://www.nps.gov/grsm/index.htm |archive-date=December 2, 2009 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Tennessee is rooted in the [[Watauga Association]], a 1772 frontier pact generally regarded as the first constitutional government west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]].{{sfn|Finger|2001|pp=46–47}} Its name derives from {{transl|chr|[[Tanasi]]}} ({{lang|chr|ᏔᎾᏏ}}), a [[Cherokee]] town preceding the first European American settlement.<ref>{{cite book|last=Bales|first=Stephen Lyn|date=2007|title=Natural Histories: Stories from the Tennessee Valley|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aIZmfXFGydwC|location=Knoxville, TN|publisher=University of Tennessee Press|pages=85–86|isbn=978-1572335615|via=Google Books}}</ref> Tennessee was initially part of North Carolina, and later the [[Southwest Territory]], before its admission to the Union as the 16th state on June 1, 1796.

During the 20th century, Tennessee transitioned from a predominantly agrarian society to a more diversified economy. This was aided in part by massive federal investment in the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] (TVA) and the city of [[Oak Ridge, Tennessee|Oak Ridge]], which was established during [[World War II]] to house the [[Manhattan Project]]'s uranium enrichment facilities for the construction of the [[History of nuclear weapons|world's first atomic bombs]]. After the war, the [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] became a key center of scientific research. The state's economy is dominated by the [[healthcare industry|health care]], [[Music of the United States#Industry and economics|music]], [[financial services|finance]], [[automotive industry in the United States|automotive]], [[chemical industry|chemical]], [[electronics industry in the United States|electronics]], and [[tourism]] sectors, and [[cattle]], [[soybean]]s, [[poultry]], [[maize|corn]], and [[cotton]] are its primary agricultural products.<ref name=homeandfarm13>{{cite web |url=https://www.tnhomeandfarm.com/agriculture/tennessees-top-five/ |title=Tennessee's Top Five|last=Bertone|first=Rachel|date=November 20, 2013|website=Tennessee Home & Farm|publisher=Tennessee Farm Bureau|access-date=<!--2021-04-09-->}}</ref> Tennessee has played a major role in the development of many forms of [[popular music]], including [[Country music|country]], [[Blues music|blues]], [[rock and roll]], [[Soul music|soul]], and [[Gospel music|gospel]].

==Etymology==
{{main|Name of Tennessee}}
[[File:Timberlake-map-tanasi-1765.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Drawing of Tanasi, Tennessee's namesake, by Henry Timberlake|Detail of [[Tanasi]] (spelled "Tennessee") on [[Henry Timberlake]]'s [[:File:Draught of the Cherokee Country.jpg|''Draught of the Cherokee Country'']]]]

Tennessee derives its name most directly from the [[Cherokee]] town of [[Tanasi]] (or "Tanase", in [[Cherokee syllabary|syllabary]]: ᏔᎾᏏ) in present-day [[Monroe County, Tennessee]], on the Tanasi River, now known as the [[Little Tennessee River]]. This town appeared on British maps as early as 1725. In 1567, [[Conquistador|Spanish explorer]] Captain [[Juan Pardo (explorer)|Juan Pardo]] and his party encountered a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] village named "Tanasqui" in the area while traveling inland from modern-day [[South Carolina]]; however, it is unknown if this was the same settlement as Tanasi.{{efn|Recent research suggests that the town Pardo recorded was at the confluence of the [[Pigeon River (Tennessee–North Carolina)|Pigeon River]] and the [[French Broad River]], near modern-day [[Newport, Tennessee]].<ref name=hudson>{{cite book |last=Hudson |first=Charles M. |author-link=Charles M.

==History==
{{main|History of Tennessee}}

===Pre-European era===
The first inhabitants of Tennessee were [[Paleo-Indians]] who arrived about 12,000 years ago at the end of the [[Last Glacial Period]]. Archaeological excavations indicate that the lower Tennessee Valley was heavily populated by Ice Age [[hunter-gatherer]]s, and Middle Tennessee is believed to have been rich with [[Game (hunting)|game animal]]s such as [[mastodon]]s.{{sfn|Satz|1979|pp=3–4}} The names of the cultural groups who inhabited the area before European contact are unknown, but archaeologists have named several distinct cultural phases, including the [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic]] (8000–1000 BC), [[Woodland period|Woodland]] (1000 BC–1000 AD), and [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian]] (1000–1600 AD) periods.<ref>{{cite web |title=Archaeology & the Native Peoples of Tennessee |url=http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/permanent/native/index.shtml |publisher=[[McClung Museum of Natural History and Culture]] |access-date=June 20, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120702205050/http://mcclungmuseum.utk.edu/permanent/native/index.shtml |archive-date=July 2, 2012 |location=Knoxville, TN}}</ref> The Archaic peoples first domesticated dogs, and plants such as [[Cucurbita|squash]], [[Maize|corn]], [[gourd]]s, and [[sunflower]]s were first grown in Tennessee during the Woodland period.{{sfn|Satz|1979|pp=4–8}} Later generations of Woodland peoples constructed the first mounds. Rapid civilizational development occurred during the Mississippian period, when Indigenous peoples developed organized [[chiefdom]]s and constructed numerous ceremonial structures throughout the state.{{sfn|Satz|1979|pp=6–11}}

Spanish conquistadors who explored the region in the 16th century encountered some of the Mississippian peoples, including the [[Muscogee|Muscogee Creek]], [[Yuchi]], and [[Shawnee]].{{sfn|Satz|1979|pp=8–11}}{{sfn|Corlew|Folmsbee|Mitchell|1981|pp=16–17}} By the early 18th century, most Natives in Tennessee had disappeared, most likely wiped out by diseases introduced by the Spaniards.{{sfn|Satz|1979|pp=8–11}} The Cherokee began migrating into what is now eastern Tennessee from what is now Virginia in the latter 17th century, possibly to escape expanding European settlement and diseases in the north.{{sfn|Satz|1979|pp=34–35}} They forced the Creek, Yuchi, and Shawnee out of the state in the early 18th century.{{sfn|Satz|1979|pp=34–35}}{{sfn|Corlew|Folmsbee|Mitchell|1981|p=18}} The Chickasaw remained confined to West Tennessee, and the middle part of the state contained few Native Americans, although both the Cherokee and the Shawnee claimed the region as their hunting ground.{{sfn|Satz|1979|p=14}} Cherokee peoples in Tennessee were known by European settlers as the [[Overhill Cherokee]] because they lived west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.{{sfn|Finger|2001|p=26}} Overhill settlements grew along the rivers in East Tennessee in the early 18th century.{{sfn|Satz|1979|pp=44–45}}

Tennessee maintains four dedicated law enforcement agencies: the [[Tennessee Highway Patrol]] (THP), the [[Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency]] (TWRA), the [[Tennessee Bureau of Investigation]] (TBI), and the [[Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation]] (TDEC). The Highway Patrol is the primary entity that enforces highway safety regulations and general non-[[wildlife]] state laws. It is under the jurisdiction of the Department of Safety. The TWRA is an independent agency tasked with enforcing all wildlife, boating, and fishery regulations outside of state parks. TDEC enforces state environmental laws and regulations.

During Reconstruction, freedmen and former free blacks were granted the right to vote; most joined the Republican Party. Numerous African Americans were elected to local offices, and some to state office. However, the Democratic Party regained control of the state in the late 1860s and early 1870s. Following Reconstruction, Tennessee continued to have competitive party politics, but in the 1880s, the White-dominated state government passed [[Jim Crow laws]], one of which imposed a [[poll tax]] requirement for voter registration. These served to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise]] most African Americans, and their power in state and local politics was markedly reduced. After the disenfranchisement of blacks, the Republican Party became a primarily white [[Sectionalism|sectional]] party supported mostly in East Tennessee. In the early 1900s, the state legislature approved legislation allowing cities to adopt a [[city commission government|commission form of government]] based on [[at-large voting]] as a means to limit African American political participation.<ref name="buch">{{cite court |litigants=Buchanan v.
