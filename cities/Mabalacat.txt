According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 293,244 people.{{PH census|current}}

Mabalacat is in the urban core of [[Metro Clark]],<ref name="PDP 2015">{{cite web |title=Philippine Development Plan 2015-2022 |url=https://pdp.neda.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/7212021_Updated-PDP-2017-2022.pdf |website=National Economic Development Authority |access-date=21 November 2023}}</ref> also known as Metro Angeles, an urban area in Pampanga.

==Etymology==
Mabalacat's name was derived from indigenous [[Negrito]] word ''mabalacat'' meaning "forest of [[Ziziphus talanai|balacats]]", a species of tree that were prominent in the area.
<!--NOTE: The name ''mabalacat'' was derived during the time when Mabalacat was NOT yet a city, hence, a town. Cityhood took effect only in the year 2012.-->

==History==
[[File:Mabalacat Old Municipal Hall, Pampanga (2).jpg|thumb|left|Old municipal hall]]
Prior to 1712, Mabalacat was a barrio ([[barangay]]) of Bambang (now [[Bamban, Tarlac]]). It became a town in 1792, and was named after the abundant Balacat tree (''[[Ziziphus talanai]]''), a fourth class timber tree with bark that possess antimicrobial properties. Once a settlement of an [[Aeta]] tribe, the area was a virtual forest of balacat trees. "''Ma-balacat''" in the native [[Kapampangan language]] means "full of Balacats." Mabalacat in [[Maranao language|Maranao]] is "'''Mababaapalaqat'''" (Palacat), which means "'''maiksing hagdan'''" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

In 1853, Mabalacat had a population of 2,611 and four barangays, namely, Babangdapu, Duquit, Malabni, and Paglimbunan. By 1903 its population increased to 7,049 in 19 barangays. These were Bical, Bundagul, Dapdap, Dau, Dolores, Iba, Mabiga, Mamatitang, Mangalit, Matas, Mawaque, Paralayunan, Poblacion, Quitangil (later renamed to San Francisco), San Joaquin, Santa Ines, Santa Maria, Sapang Balen, and Sapang Biabas. In 1948, Mabalacat's barangays increased to 20 with the addition of [[Fort Stotsenburg]].

In 1860, a military command was established by authorities of the Spanish Governor-General due to the lawlessness and depredations perpetrated by the negritos (Aetas, or derogatorily called ''balugas''). The Pampanga towns of [[Bamban]], [[Capas, Tarlac|Capas]], [[Concepcion, Tarlac|Concepcion]], [[Victoria, Tarlac|Victoria]], [[Tarlac City|Tarlac]], [[Magalang, Pampanga|Magalang]], [[Porac, Pampanga|Porac]], and [[Floridablanca, Pampanga|Floridablanca]] and Mabalacat were created into what was called a ''Commandancia Militar''. However, in 1873, the Military Command returned Mabalacat together with the towns of Magalang, Floridablanca, and Porac to the parent province, Pampanga.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
The former [[Municipalities of the Philippines|municipality]] was officially upgraded to a city following a referendum on July 21, 2012, and became the third in Pampanga after [[Angeles City]] and [[San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]]. It is home to roughly most of the [[Clark Freeport Zone]], the rest in nearby Angeles, where the main gate is located. [[Clark International Airport]], as well as the numerous hotels, casinos, golf courses, and resorts in Clark Freeport, are mostly situated in Mabalacat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mabalacatcity.gov.ph/index.php/9-uncategorised/76-business |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140323075921/http://mabalacatcity.gov.ph/index.php/9-uncategorised/76-business |archive-date=March 23, 2014 |title=Business Establishments |website=Mabalacat City Council}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Mabalacat has a land area of {{convert|83.18|km2|sp=us}}. It is {{convert|93|km|sp=us}} from Manila, {{convert|10|km|sp=us}} from Angeles, and {{convert|27|km|sp=us}} from the provincial capital, [[San Fernando, Pampanga|San Fernando]].

The soil is charcoal black and shiny, a sign of fertility, and is suitable for growing rice, sugarcane and other rootcrops. Like the neighbouring cities of Angeles and San Fernando and the towns/municipalities of [[Porac, Pampanga|Porac]], [[Bacolor, Pampanga|Bacolor]], [[Santa Rita, Pampanga|Santa Rita]], [[Mexico, Pampanga|Mexico]], [[Magalang, Pampanga|Magalang]] and [[Arayat, Pampanga|Arayat]], this city rarely gets inundated by floods from heavy rains and typhoons because it is situated on an elevated, well-drained part of the Central Luzon plains known as the "Upper Pampanga".

===Barangays===
Mabalacat is politically subdivided into 27 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}
* Atlu-Bola (San Isidro)
* Bical (San Roque)
* Bundagul (San Antonio)
* Cacutud (San Roque)
* Calumpang (San Jose Obrero)
* Camachiles (Inmaculada Concepcion)

* Santo Rosario (Virgen Santo Rosario)

{{Div col end}}

The largest barangay is Dau, which became a barrio in 1936 by virtue of ''Presidential Proclamation No. 1''. It is now a business center whose commercial output runs parallel to that of downtown. A former terminus of the [[North Luzon Expressway]], it is the most urban and most populous area in Mabalacat, home to roughly 23% of the city's population.

San Francisco, the second largest barangay, along with San Joaquin, Santa Ines, Poblacion, Calumpang and other barangays are categorized as urban in view of their proximity to the city proper. Sapang Balen, with a population of 166 persons, is the smallest barangay.

== City Fiesta ==

Legend tells us that when the early settlers were clearing the forests, Cabezang Laureana's workers found, hidden among the bushes, a statue of the Blessed Virgin Mary with baby Jesus sitting on her lap. On February 2, the statue was presented by Caragan as a gift to Padre Maximo Manuguid, the priest of the early Mabalacat Church that was made of ''sawali'' and cogon grass. From then on, the city fiesta was observed on the second of February.

The old town hall was named Tabnuan: Mabalacat Cultural Center, or museum of arts, cultural displays and exhibits. It opened on February 28, 2024, the cityâ€™s Balacat Festival.<ref>{{cite news |last1= Cayabyab|first1=Charlene |title=Old municipio to reopen as Mabalacat City arts center|url= https://www.sunstar.com.ph/pampanga/old-municipio-to-reopen-as-mabalacat-city-arts-center|accessdate=February 28, 2024 |publisher=[[SunStar Cebu]] |date=February 23, 2024}}</ref>

=== Pastorella ===
The pastorella ([[Mass (music)#Ordinarium|Misa]] de Pastores in honor of the shepherds at the birth of Jesus Christ - a set of [[Latin]] [[hymns]] of the 9-day Christmas Masses) ceased in [[Pampanga]] towns for 40 years after [[Vatican II]].

In Mabalacat, however, at Our Lady of Divine Grace Parish, pastorella lives on: In the 4:30&nbsp;a.m. mass on Monday, the pastorella repertoire includes the [[Kyrie]] (Lord, Have Mercy), [[Gloria in Excelsis Deo|Gloria]] (Glory to God in the Highest), [[Credo]] (Nicene Creed), [[Sanctus]] (Holy) and [[Agnus Dei (liturgy)|Agnus Dei]] (Lamb of God). The hymns are in Latin, except for Kyrie, which is in Greek.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20071223-108415/Latin_hymns_sung_in_masses_in_Pampanga |title=Latin hymns sung in masses in Pampanga |first=Tonette |last=Orejas |date=23 December 2007  |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423084921/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/nation/view/20071223-108415/Latin_hymns_sung_in_masses_in_Pampanga |archive-date=April 23, 2009 }}</ref>
