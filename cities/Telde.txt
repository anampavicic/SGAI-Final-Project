'''Telde''' is a [[Municipalities of Spain|municipality]] in the eastern part of the island of [[Gran Canaria]], [[Canary Islands]], overseas (Atlantic) insular Spain. It borders [[Las Palmas]] to the north and is part of its urban area.

It is the second most populous municipality on the island, with a population of {{formatnum:102170}} (2013).<ref name=pop>[http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/E30260A_1/php/pob_001.php?anyo=2013&territorio=35026 Instituto Canario de Estadística] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20140422190534/http://www2.gobiernodecanarias.org/istac/estadisticas/E30260A_1/php/pob_001.php?anyo=2013&territorio=35026 |date=2014-04-22 }}, population</ref> Its area is {{convert|102.43|km²|2|abbr=on}}.<ref name=area/> The city is the oldest and the first capital of the island of Gran Canaria, founded before 1351, a former medieval bishopric and present Catholic [[titular see]]. The [[Autopista GC-1|GC-1]] motorway passes east of the city. [[Gran Canaria International Airport]] is located in the subdivision of Gando, south of Telde.

== History ==
Before the Spanish invasion Telde was the eastern centre of the aborigines of the island, and the renowned aborigine Doramas is believed to have lived here. Early records point to about 14,000 aboriginal dwellings in Telde at the time of conquest; Telde is the spot where the famous Idolo de Tara figure—currently housed in the [[Museo Canario]] in [[Las Palmas]]—was discovered.

It was created by papal decree in 1351. Today Telde is Gran Canaria's second city with a population over 100,000. The historic old town area of Telde is particularly popular with visitors.

== Ecclesiastical History ==
The '''Diocese of Islas de la Fortuna''' (español) / Isola de Fortunate (Italiano) / Insulas Fortunatis (Latin) (meaning 'Fortunate islands', the nickname of the Canaries) was established on 7 November 1351.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t1741.htm|title=Titular See of Telde, Spain|website=GCatholic}}</ref> The territory split off from the Balearic [[Diocese of Mallorca]], as [[suffragan]] of the (Andalusian) Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Seville]].

Renamed in 1369 after its see as Diocese of Telde (Spanish) / Telden(sis) (Latin adjective).

On 7 July 1404 it lost territory to establish the [[Diocese of Rubicon]].

In 1441 it was suppressed, without direct successor.

In the past, Telde was an agricultural community, the main crops being sugar canes, vineyards, bananas and tomatoes. Today the surrounding area of Telde is quite heavily industrialised, becoming the industrial centre on the island.<ref>[http://www.iknow-canaryislands.co.uk/tourist_information/gran_canaria_holidays/rural_gran_canaria/telde_gran_canaria.htm iknow-canaryislands.co.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024102433/http://www.iknow-canaryislands.co.uk/tourist_information/gran_canaria_holidays/rural_gran_canaria/telde_gran_canaria.htm |date=2007-10-24 }}</ref>

== Main sights ==
The church San Juan Bautista (John the Baptist) de Telde is the true spiritual centre of Telde. Located in the square of the same name and founded in 1483, the old church was erected by the Garcia del Castillo family at the time of the town's foundation. It still has the original gateway, an example of [[Sevillian]]-[[Manueline|Portuguese Gothic]] architecture. The towers, however, are an example of early 20th neo-Gothic construction. The real marvels are inside the building: the statue of Christ on the main altar, made from corn dough by the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] [[Mexican people|Mexican]] Indians, brought here before 1550, the [[Flemish people|Flemish]] Gothic main altar, which dates back to before 1516, and the triptych of the [[Virgin Mary]], brought from [[Flanders]], also in the 16th century, depicting five religious scenes.<ref>[http://www.mytravelguide.com/attractions/profile-79492905-Canary_Islands_Gran_Canaria_Iglesia_de_San_Juan_Bautista_de_Telde.html mytravelguide.com]</ref>

Telde has 101 archaeological sites and 709 listed sites of ethnographic interest. The number of sites increases each year, as do new aspects of old fields, but most are in disrepair and many are disappearing. Some of the most prominent are the coastal town of Tufia, in good condition and extensively excavated by archaeologists; [[Four Doors cave site|Four Doors]] (''Cuatro Puertas''), a large cave with four doors located on top of a mountain overlooking the plain adjoined to a village of [[cave house]]s with collective barn at the back; the caves of Tara and Cendro, remains of the ancient centre of population; the town of Draguillo on the border with [[Ingenio, Las Palmas|Ingenio]]; ''las cuevas Chalasia'' which consist of a labyrinthine series of artificial caves linked by tunnels; and the impressive [[necropolis]] of Jinámar which includes more than 500 tombs of various types.

== Climate ==
Telde has a moderate [[desert climate]].
