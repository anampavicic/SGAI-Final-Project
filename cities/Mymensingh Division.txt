== History ==
[[File:Provincial Geographies of India Volume 2 0013.jpg|thumb|left|Provincial Map of Bengal showing the Greater Mymensingh Area (present Division with [[Tangail District|Tangail]] and [[Kishoreganj District|Kishoreganj]]) in 1917.]]
Mymensingh’s history stretches far into antiquity. Around the [[4th century BC]], it was a significant part of the Vedic state of [[Mahajanapadas|Mahajanapada]]. Over the centuries, the region witnessed the rise and fall of various dynasties, including the [[Gupta Empire]], the [[Sena dynasty|Sena Dynasty]], and the Muslim rulers during the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]]. Each era left its mark on Mymensingh’s cultural and political landscape.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mymensingh, BD : Interesting Facts, Famous Things & History Information {{!}} What Is Mymensingh Known For? |url=https://www.hollymelody.com/guide/bangladesh/mymensingh-bd-interesting-facts-famous-things-history-information-what-is |access-date=2024-07-20 |website=HollyMelody {{!}} Travel Guide and Tips {{!}} Amazing Facts & History |language=en}}</ref> 

The Greater Mymensingh region (Mymensingh District along with five other neighbouring districts) was created as a Mymensingh district by the British Indian government in 1787. Later it was reorganized in two phases into six districts: [[Mymensingh]], [[Kishoreganj District|Kishoreganj]], [[Netrakona District|Netrakona]], [[Jamalpur District|Jamalpur]], [[Tangail District|Tangail]], and [[Sherpur District|Sherpur]].<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&q=which+was+later+reorganized+into+six+districts&pg=PA325 |title=Historical Dictionary of the Bengalis |publisher=Scarecrow Press |date=22 August 2013 |isbn=9780810880245 |access-date=26 January 2015 |archive-date=25 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211025213332/https://books.google.com/books?id=QVOFAAAAQBAJ&q=which+was+later+reorganized+into+six+districts&pg=PA325 |url-status=live }}</ref> But [[Kishoreganj District|Kishoreganj]] and [[Tangail District|Tangail]] are no longer part of [[Mymensingh]], so [[Mymensingh]] comprises four districts.

On 12 January 2015, prime minister [[Sheikh Hasina]] declared the establishment of a new Mymensingh Division. The initial intention was to carve six districts (those comprising the original Mymensingh district of 1787) out of the [[Dhaka Division]]. However, while four of the districts were eager for the establishment of a new division, people in the Tangail and Kishoreganj Districts wished to remain part of Dhaka Division.<ref>{{cite news|script-title=bn:প্রচ্ছদ ময়মনসিংহকে দেশ থেকে বিতারিত করা উচিত।|url=http://www.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/article/423265/%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%9C%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B6-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B7%E0%A6%A6-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%97|access-date=14 January 2015|agency=Prothom Alo|issue=14–70|date=14 January 2015|language=bn|archive-date=11 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171111094616/http://www.prothom-alo.com/bangladesh/article/423265/%E0%A6%86%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%9C%E0%A7%8B%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%B0-%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A6%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%B6-%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%AF%E0%A6%BC%E0%A6%A8%E0%A6%BF-%E0%A6%AE%E0%A6%A8%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%A4%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AA%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B7%E0%A6%A6-%E0%A6%AC%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%AD%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%97|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=thedailystar.net>{{cite news |title=Mymensingh to become new division |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/mymensingh-to-become-new-division-61779 |newspaper=The Daily Star |access-date=26 January 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215160740/http://www.thedailystar.net/mymensingh-to-become-new-division-61779|archive-date=15 February 2015}}</ref> On 14 September 2015 Mymensingh was officially announced as a division consisting of four districts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Govt gives final approval for Mymensingh as country's eighth administrative division|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/09/14/govt-gives-final-approval-for-mymensingh-as-country-s-eighth-administrative-division|access-date=15 September 2015|newspaper=Bdnews24.com|date=14 September 2015|archive-date=15 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150915073114/http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2015/09/14/govt-gives-final-approval-for-mymensingh-as-country-s-eighth-administrative-division|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Mymensingh a division now|url=http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2015/sep/15/mymensingh-division-now|access-date=15 September 2015|newspaper=Dhaka Tribune|date=15 September 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208065827/http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/2015/sep/15/mymensingh-division-now|archive-date=8 December 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Mymensingh to become eighth division of Bangladesh|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/mymensingh-become-division-143359|access-date=15 September 2015|newspaper=[[Daily Star (Bangladesh)|Daily Star]]|date=14 September 2015|archive-date=21 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201021171320/https://www.thedailystar.net/backpage/mymensingh-become-division-143359|url-status=live}}</ref>
