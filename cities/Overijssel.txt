'''Overijssel''' ({{IPA|nl|ˌoːvərˈɛisəl|lang|Nl-Overijssel.oga}}; {{langx|nds-nl|Oaveriessel}} {{IPA|nds|ˌɒːvərˈiːsl̩|}}; {{langx|de|Oberyssel}}; {{literally|Across the [[IJssel]]}}) is a [[Provinces of the Netherlands|province]] of the [[Netherlands]] located in the eastern part of the country. The province's name comes from the perspective of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht|Episcopal principality of Utrecht]], which held the territory until 1528. The capital city of Overijssel is [[Zwolle]] (pop. 132,441<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://opendata.cbs.nl/statline/#/CBS/nl/dataset/70072ned/table|title = CBS Statline}}</ref>) and the largest city is [[Enschede]] (pop. 161,235). The province had a population of about 1,184,000 as of January 2023. The land mostly consists of grasslands and some forests (including [[Sallandse Heuvelrug National Park]]); it also borders a small part of the [[IJsselmeer]] to the west.

==Geography==
Overijssel is bordered by [[Germany]] ([[Lower Saxony]] and [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]) to the east, the [[Achterhoek]] region of [[Gelderland]] to the south, the [[Veluwe]] region of Gelderland and [[Flevoland]] to the west, and [[Friesland]] and the former moors of [[Drenthe]] to the north. Overijssel comprises three regions: [[Kop van Overijssel]] in the northwest, [[Salland]] in the centre of the province, and [[Twente]] in the east. Besides the capital [[Zwolle]], other major cities are [[Almelo]], [[Deventer]], [[Hengelo]], [[Enschede]], and [[Kampen, Netherlands|Kampen]].

To the southeast, the province's surface is mostly sandy, interspersed with small rivers such as the [[Regge River|Regge]] and [[Dinkel]] and other brooks. In the northwest, the geology is dominated by sediments from the ''[[Vecht (Overijssel)|Overijsselse Vecht]]'' and clay. The northern parts were once covered by ''veen'' ([[bog]]s) which separated the dryer and more arable south from [[Drenthe]] and which have been exploited as fuel to a large degree. Only small patches survive today (''Engbertsdijksvenen'' near [[Geesteren, Overijssel|Geesteren]], ''Witteveen'' (near [[Haaksbergen]]), and the Aamsveen (near [[Enschede]]). The extreme northwest is dominated by a system of lakes formed by former peat-mining and protected under the [[De Weerribben-Wieden National Park]] status, which is a valuable wetland.

The highest point in Overijssel is the summit of the Tankenberg, a hill in the municipality of [[Losser]], at 85 metres (278&nbsp;ft). The lowest point is in the Mastenbroek [[Polder]] near [[Kampen, Netherlands|Kampen]] at 2 metres (6&nbsp;ft) below [[sea level]].

'''Important rivers''' : [[IJssel]], [[Zwarte Water]], [[Vechte|Overijsselse Vecht]], [[Dinkel]], [[Regge (river)|Regge]] and Reest .

'''Major channels''' : [[Twentekanaal]] (Enschede and Zutphen-branch to Almelo), Overijssels Kanaal, Kanaal Almelo-De Haandrik, Kanaal Almelo-Nordhorn (outdoors) and Dedemsvaart (largely muted).

===Climate===

Overijssel enjoys an oceanic climate ([[Oceanic climate|Cfb]] in the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen classification]]). However, winters tend to be more severe than the rest of the Netherlands, because of its distance from the coast.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.whatstheweatherlike.org/netherlands/overijssel.htm |title = Overijssel climate info &#124; what's the weather like in Overijssel, the Netherlands}}</ref>

==History==
[[Image:Low Countries Locator Prince-Bischopric Utrecht.svg|thumb|180px|Map of the [[Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht|Bishopric of Utrecht]] around 1350, when present-day Overijssel was part of the region Oversticht]]

===Oversticht===
Overijssel was formerly known as '''Oversticht''' and also included most of the modern-day province of [[Drenthe]]. In 1336, it was made part of [[Guelders]], though it was ceded to the [[Prince-Bishopric of Utrecht|Bishopric of Utrecht]] in 1347. The Bishops ceded the Oversticht to the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] in 1528, who styled himself [[Lordship of Overijssel|Lord of Overijssel]], after the Latin name of Oversticht that was known since 1233: ''Transysla'' or ''Transisalania'', or Over-IJssel, i.e. the other side of the river [[IJssel]]. The people joined with the other Dutch and rebelled against Charles' heir [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]]. Overijssel became governed by the most powerful mayors and lords in the province, including by the lieutenant-governor [[Nicolaas Schmelzing]] (1561–1629).

After a brief occupation by the forces of the [[Bishop of Münster]] (1672–74), Overijssel received a new form of government which granted the [[stadtholder]]s more power. Widespread resistance against the increased power throughout the provinces eventually led to the formation of the [[Batavian Republic]] in 1795. A centralist government arose and the Netherlands was organised into a series of ''[[département]]s'', based on those used by revolutionary [[France]].

===Overijssel===
At first organised into its own ''[[Overijssel (département)|département]]'', it was merged with [[Drenthe]] in 1798 to form [[Ouden IJssel]], which was renamed Overijssel in 1801.

The French annexed the Batavian Republic in 1810, and Overijssel was organised into the new French département of [[Bouches-de-l'Yssel]]. After the defeat of [[Napoleon]] in 1814, the kingdom of the Netherlands and the former province of Overijssel were recreated.

Overijssel was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] from May 1940 until its liberation in April 1945. The [[Noordoostpolder]], a [[land reclamation|reclaimed]] territory which had been laid dry in 1942, was part of Overijssel from 1962 until 1986, when it became part of the newly created province of [[Flevoland]].

== Politics ==
[[File:Overijssel verkiezingen 2011.png|thumb|Diagram of the 2011 election results for the [[States-Provincial]] in Overijssel]]
The [[King's Commissioner]] of Overijssel is [[Andries Helma|Andries Heidema]] ([[Christian Union (Netherlands)|CU]]) since 11 July 2018. The King's Commissioner is the chairman of the [[Provincial-Executive (Netherlands)|Provincial-Executive]] (executive branch) and the [[States-Provincial]] (elected legislature) of the province.

The [[Provincial council (Netherlands)|Provincial Council]], the general government of the province, consists of 47 members<ref>{{Cite web|date=2018-09-13|title=Welke Statenleden zijn er? – Provincie Overijssel|url=http://www.overijssel.nl/bestuur/provinciale-staten/provinciale-staten/statenleden/|access-date=2021-08-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180913112836/http://www.overijssel.nl/bestuur/provinciale-staten/provinciale-staten/statenleden/|archive-date=2018-09-13}}</ref> who are elected every four years. Until the States elections of March 2007, Overijssel had 63 Members of Parliament. An amendment to the Provinces Act resulted in the total number of States members in the Netherlands being reduced from 764 to the current 564.

In 2015, 26.1% of the population belonged to the [[Protestant Church in the Netherlands]], while 23.3% were [[Roman Catholic]], 2.9% were [[Islam|Muslim]], and 5.6% adhered to other faiths. Over two-fifths of the population (42.2%) identified as non-religious.

== Economy ==
The [[Gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 43.2 billion € in 2018, accounting for 5.6% of the Netherlands economic output. GDP per capita adjusted for purchasing power was 32,700 € or 108% of the EU27 average in the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref>

The province has become highly industrialized. The [[Twente]] district in the southeast, where cotton spinning, weaving, and bleaching came into prominence in the 19th century, is one of the principal centres of the Dutch textile industry. The main centres are Enschede, Almelo, Hengelo, and Oldenzaal. Other important industrial centres are Deventer, Kampen, and Zwolle.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Overijssel {{!}} province, Netherlands|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Overijssel|access-date=2021-08-05|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

==Transport==

=== Road ===
[[File:Zwolle N35 Ceintuurbaan.JPG|thumb|Rijksweg N35 ''Ceintuurbaan'' in [[Zwolle]]]]
Overijssel is an important transit province to and from [[Germany]] and the northeast of the Netherlands. There are three main motorways in Overijssel, the [[A1 motorway (Netherlands)|A1]], [[A28 motorway (Netherlands)|A28]], and the [[A35 motorway (Netherlands)|A35/N35]]. Other major trunk roads are the [[A15 motorway (Netherlands)|N18]], [[A32 motorway (Netherlands)|A32]], [[N36 motorway (Netherlands)|N36]], [[N48 motorway (Netherlands)|N48]] and [[N50 road (Netherlands)|N50]]. In addition, the province manages a large number of [[Trunk road|provincial roads]] of major and minor importance.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://hitchwiki.org/en/Category:Overijssel |title = Category:Overijssel – Hitchwiki: The Hitchhiker's guide to Hitchhiking}}</ref>

* The A1 enters the province at Deventer and runs via Hengelo and Oldenzaal to the German border, where it connects to the [[Bundesautobahn 30|German A30]]. The A1 is an important hinterland connection with a lot of freight traffic. The road will be widened to 2x4 lanes between Knooppunt Beekbergen and Deventer and to 2x3 lanes between Deventer and Knooppunt Azelo.

* The N18 forms a connection between Enschede and the Achterhoek. The road was newly opened in 2018 between Enschede and Groenlo as a motorway.

* The A28 runs for approximately 20 kilometers in the province, but is the busiest road in Overijssel, with 130,000 vehicles crossing the IJsselbrug every day. The A28 was very sensitive to congestion, but in 2010/2011 the A28 was widened from 2x2 to 2x3 lanes from the Hattemerbroek junction to the Lankhorst junction (excluding the route through Zwolle).

* The A32 runs from [[Meppel]] to [[Leeuwarden]], but this highway runs partly through the [[Kop van Overijssel]] along [[Steenwijk]], among others. The A32 joins the A28 at [[Staphorst]]. The A32 is therefore an important arterial road for the northwest of the province.

* The N35 is the most important transport axis through Midden-Overijssel. The road runs from the A28 in Zwolle via Raalte and Nijverdal to Wierden, where the road turns into the A35 past Almelo and Hengelo to Enschede. From Enschede the road turns back into the N35 to the German border. The N35 is the most important connection between the cities of [[Twente]] and the [[Ruhr]] area and [[Münster]].

* The N36 between Almelo and Ommen and the N48 between Ommen and Hoogeveen together form a connection between Twente and Groningen and between Zwolle and Hardenberg. Both roads are two-lane highways.

* The N50 is an important connection from Zwolle to Kampen and further to Flevoland and Friesland.

=== Rail network ===
[[File:Enschede stationsplein.JPG|thumbnail|The [[Enschede railway station]].]]Four intercity connections (Enschede-Randstad, Zwolle – Roosendaal and Groningen/Leeuwarden-Amersfoort-Randstad and Groningen/Leeuwarden-Lelystad-Randstad) run through Overijssel. [[Zwolle railway station]] has a junction function. The stations of Almelo, Deventer and Hengelo have a transfer function. The stations of Hengelo, Enschede and Oldenzaal have a direct connection with Germany. The international intercity to [[Berlin]] stops in Deventer, Almelo and Hengelo. Goods traffic takes place on many lines to Germany and the north of the Netherlands.

The following railway lines are located in Overijssel:

* [[Utrecht–Kampen railway|Utrecht – Kampen railway]] : (Utrecht -) Zwolle – Kampen
* [[Arnhem–Leeuwarden railway|Arnhem – Leeuwarden railway]] : (Arnhem -) Deventer – Zwolle – Steenwijk (- Leeuwarden)
* [[Zutphen–Glanerbeek railway|Zutphen – Glanerbeek railway]] : (Zutphen -) Goor – Hengelo – Enschede (- Gronau (D))
* [[Lelystad–Zwolle railway|Lelystad – Zwolle railway]] : (Lelystad -) Kampen South – Zwolle
* Zwolle – Stadskanaal railway : Zwolle – Hardenberg (- Emmen)
* [[Zwolle–Almelo railway|Zwolle – Almelo railway]] : Zwolle – Wierden – Almelo
* Mariënberg – Almelo railway : Mariënberg – Almelo
* [[Almelo–Salzbergen railway|Almelo – Salzbergen railway]] : Almelo – Hengelo – Oldenzaal (- Salzbergen (D))
* [[Apeldoorn–Deventer railway|Apeldoorn – Deventer railway]] : (Apeldoorn -) Deventer

=== Airport ===
The main airport in Overijssel is the [[Enschede Airport Twente]], located outside of [[Enschede]]. The airport does not currently offer any international flights, though it has historically.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://ourairports.com/countries/NL/OV/airports.html?sort=popular |title = Airports in Overijssel, Netherlands @ OurAirports}}</ref>

=== Waterways ===
Due to its location on the IJssel, Overijssel has a number of large bridges. The most important is the IJsselbrug near Zwolle, but the IJsselbrug near Deventer is also important. These are also the busiest roads in the province. At Kampen the [[N50 road (Netherlands)|N50]] crosses the IJssel. Kampen also has two bridges over the IJssel. Other bridges over the IJssel are at Zwolle the Oude IJsselbrug and the railway bridge over the IJssel, and at Deventer a railway and road bridge. In addition to these bridges, the river IJssel can also be crossed at a number of places by means of a number of ferries.

==Municipalities==
{{See also|Municipalities of the Netherlands}}[[Image:Kaart Overijssel genummerd.jpg|thumb|The [[Municipalities of the Netherlands|municipalities]] of Overijssel]]

Overijssel is divided into 25 municipalities. Until 1 January 2001, there were still 44, but after a municipal reclassification came into effect, the number fell to 26. On 1 January 2005, the municipalities of Deventer and [[Bathmen]] were merged (under the name [[Deventer]]), reducing the number of municipalities into 25.
