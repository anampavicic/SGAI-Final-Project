The '''Baling District''' is an [[Districts of Malaysia|administrative district]] in southeastern [[Kedah]], [[Malaysia]]. Located about 110&nbsp;km from [[Alor Setar]], it borders [[Perak]] and [[Betong, Thailand|Betong]], the southernmost town of [[Thailand]].

==Name==
[[File:Baling Town - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Baling town]]
The name '''Baling''' can be traced to a series of events detailed in the story of [[Raja Bersiong]] (The Fanged King), a popular legend of Kedah, recorded in the Hikayat Merong Mahawangsa. Raja Bersiong was a ruthless vampire-like king with a taste for human blood who preyed on his subjects. His subjects finally rose against him and burned down the palace. When the fanged king fled his palace at the Old Kedah capital in [[Lembah Bujang]], he fled to a place named Merbau and began removing his fangs by twisting them by hand. As a result of the twisting act, Merbau was renamed as [[Merbau Pulas (state constituency)|Merbau Pulas]] where ''pulas'' in [[Malay language|Malay]] means twisting.

After the king had successfully removed both his fangs, he threw them away to a faraway place. The place where he stood when he threw his fangs is known as ''Baling'' which means ''throw'' and the place believed to be the site where the fangs landed was named ''Siong,'' which means ''fang'' in Malay, one of the villages in Baling district.

The name Baling is also from Thai language "Ba Taling" ({{langx|th|บ่าตลิ่ง}}; "river bank").

==History==
{{main|Baling Talks}}
Baling was also the site where the leaders of the [[Malay Races Liberation Army]], the newly formed Malayan Government, and the [[British Empire|British]] met in 1955 to try to end the [[Malayan Emergency]]. [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], a leader of the Malayan government, implored the Communists to give up their arms peacefully by promising that no retaliatory action would be taken against them. The MRLA leader [[Chin Peng]] expressed skepticism of a pardon promised by the leader of a nation that had yet to gain its independence (Malaya's independence was gained in two years later in 1957). Chin Peng insisted that the Malayan government and the British endorse the MRLA as a legal Communist Party so that it could run in the forthcoming elections. This was denied, however, and thus no agreement was reached.

:Gunung Pulai and Gunung Baling
Gunung Pulai is a 600 meter mountain located within this district. Rising from the earth some 450 million years ago, Gunung Baling is known to be one of the oldest formations of its kind in Malaysia. It stands opposite of 2 other tall rock formations, Gunung Baling and Gunung Besar, that together make up what some call the Baling Mountain Range. Gunung Pulai also hosts several cave systems that are filled with magnificent stalactites and stalagmites formations that litter its ceiling and floor. Locals have been frequenting the mountain to take advantage of its rich biodiversity, harvesting guano and birds nest from the mountain’s many caves as well as gathering rare plants and herbs at the foot of the tall mountain.The mountain also recently became a popular escape spot for thrill-seekers looking to conquer the mountain's peak, explore its deep caverns and take in the lush greenery of its surrounding forests.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.therakyatpost.com/2020/02/12/kedahs-gunung-pulai-is-a-prehistoric-wonder-thats-now-under-threat/#:~:text=Gunung%20Pulai%20is%20a%20600%20meter-tall%20mountain%20situated,oldest%20formations%20of%20its%20kind%20in%20the%20country.|title = Kedah's Gunung Pulai is a Prehistoric Wonder That's Now Under Threat &#124; TRP| date=12 February 2020 }}</ref>
