'''Milton Keynes''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-uk-MiltonKeynes.ogg|k|iː|n|z}} {{respell|KEENZ}}) is a [[city status in the United Kingdom|city]]{{efn|The area that is the subject of this article, the contiguous urban segment of the City of Milton Keynes local authority area, does not have legal city status itself although it is usually known as "the city". The [[Letters Patent]] were awarded to the responsible local authority rather than to the settlement itself. See section {{slink||Formal award of city status}} below for more details.}} in [[Buckinghamshire]],<!-- Yes, Buckinghamshire the ceremonial county, which contains two administrative counties (unitary authorities), Buckinghamshire Council [q.v.] (80% of county) and Milton Keynes City Council [q.v.] (20% of county; urban MK is 20% of the CoMK UA). --> England, about {{convert|50|mi}} north-west of [[London]].{{efn|name=londist}} At the 2021 Census, the population of [[Milton Keynes urban area|its urban area]] was 264,349.<ref name="BUA2021" /> The [[River Great Ouse]] forms the northern boundary of the urban area; a tributary, the [[River Ouzel]], meanders through its [[linear park]]s and [[balancing lake]]s. Approximately 25% of the urban area is parkland or woodland and includes two [[Site of Special Scientific Interest|Sites of Special Scientific Interest]] (SSSIs).

In the 1960s, the government decided that a further generation of [[new towns in the United Kingdom|new towns]] in the [[South East England |south east of England]] was needed to relieve housing congestion in London. Milton Keynes was to be the biggest yet, with a population of 250,000 and area of {{convert|22,000|acre|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}. At designation, its area incorporated the existing towns of [[Bletchley]],  [[Fenny Stratford]], [[Wolverton]] and [[Stony Stratford]],{{efn|The adjacent towns of [[Newport Pagnell]] and [[Woburn Sands]] were not included in the original 1967 designated area of the new town but have become part of the [[Milton Keynes urban area]] since then.<ref name="BUA2011" />}} along with another fifteen villages and farmland in between. These settlements had an extensive historical record since the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]]; detailed archaeological investigations before development revealed evidence of human occupation from the [[Neolithic]] period, including the [[Milton Keynes Hoard]] of [[Bronze Age]] gold jewellery. The government established [[Milton Keynes Development Corporation]] (MKDC) to design and deliver this new city. The {{notatypo|Corporation}}  decided on a softer, more human-scaled landscape than in the earlier English new towns but with an emphatically [[Modern architecture|modernist architecture]]. Recognising how traditional towns and cities had become choked in traffic, they established a grid of distributor roads about {{convert|1|km}} between edges, leaving the spaces between to develop more organically. An extensive network of [[shared path]]s for leisure cyclists and pedestrians criss-crosses through and between them. Rejecting the residential [[tower block]] concept that had [[tower blocks in Great Britain|become unpopular]], they set a height limit of three storeys outside [[Central Milton Keynes]].

Facilities include a 1,400-seat theatre, a municipal art gallery, two multiplex cinemas, an [[ecumenical]] central church, a 400-seat concert hall, a teaching hospital, a 30,500-seat football stadium, an indoor ski-slope and a 65,000-capacity open-air concert venue. Seven railway stations serve the [[Milton Keynes urban area]] (one inter-city). The [[Open University]] is based here and there is a small campus of the [[University of Bedfordshire]]. Most major sports are represented at amateur level; [[Red Bull Racing]] (Formula One), [[MK Dons]] (association football), and [[Milton Keynes Lightning]] (ice hockey) are its professional teams. The [[Peace Pagoda]] overlooking Willen Lake was the first such to be built in Europe. The many works of sculpture in parks and public spaces include the iconic ''[[Concrete Cows]]'' at [[Milton Keynes Museum]].

Milton Keynes is among the most economically productive localities in the UK, ranking highly against a number of criteria. It has the UK's fifth-highest number of business startups per capita (but equally of business failures). It is home to several major national and international companies. Despite economic success and personal wealth for some, there are pockets of nationally significant poverty. The employment profile is composed of about 90% service industries and 9% manufacturing.

==History==
{{Main|History of Milton Keynes}}

===Birth of a 'new city'<!-- Leave this as 'city', it's in inverted commas for a reason. All the 1960s government papers and MKDC design documents described it as a 'new city'. The term 'New City' remains in common use locally, particularly to distinguish the wider urban area from the existing towns that contributed to it. Towns within a town would be totally confusing. -->===
{{see also|History of Milton Keynes#Milton Keynes Development Corporation: designing a city for 250,000 people}}
{{Blockquote|It may startle some political economists to talk of commencing the building of ''new cities'' ... planned as cities from their first foundation, and not mere small towns and villages. ... A time will arrive when something of this sort must be done ... England cannot escape from the alternative of new city building.

Do you lay it out like an American city, rigid orthogonal from side to side?  Being more sensitive in 1966-7, the designers decided that the grid concept should apply but should be a lazy grid following the flow of land, its valleys, its ebbs and flows. That would be nicer to look at, more economical and efficient to build, and would sit more beautifully as a landscape intervention.

{{Main|Milton Keynes grid road system|List of districts in Milton Keynes}}
The Milton Keynes Development Corporation planned the major road layout according to [[street hierarchy]] principles, using a [[Grid plan|grid pattern]] of approximately {{convert|1|km|abbr=on}} intervals, rather than on the more conventional [[wikt:radial|radial]] pattern found in older settlements.{{sfnb|Llewellyn-Davies|Weeks|Forestier-Walker|Bor|1970|p=16}} Major distributor roads run between communities, rather than through them: these distributor roads are known locally as ''[[Milton Keynes grid road system|grid roads]]'' and the spaces between them{{snd}} the neighbourhoods{{snd}} are known as ''grid squares'' (though few are actually square or even [[wikt:rectilinear|rectilinear]]).<ref>{{cite book|first=Derek |last=Walker |title=The Architecture and Planning of Milton Keynes |publisher=Architectural Press |year=1982 |page=8 |location=London|isbn=978-0-85139-735-1}} cited in {{cite book|first=Mark |last=Clapson |title=A Social History of Milton Keynes: Middle England/Edge City |url=https://archive.org/details/socialhistorymil00clap |url-access=limited |pages=[https://archive.org/details/socialhistorymil00clap/page/n60 40] |publisher=Frank Cass |location=London |year=2004|isbn=978-0-7146-8417-8}}</ref> This spacing was chosen so that people would always be within six minutes' walking distance of a grid-road bus-stop.{{sfnb|Llewellyn-Davies|Weeks|Forestier-Walker|Bor|1970|p=33}}{{efn|In reality, the bus operators have specified many bus routes that go through, rather than between, neighbourhoods.}} Consequently, each grid square is a semi-autonomous community, making a unique collective of 100 clearly identifiable neighbourhoods within the overall urban environment.{{sfnb|Bendixson|Platt|1992|pp=175{{ndash}}178}}{{efn|Bendixson & Platt report the Corporation as concerned at this outcome, which was an unanticipated emergent behaviour. In later developments, it aimed for increased permeability through the grid.{{sfnb|Bendixson|Platt|1992|p=175}}}} The grid squares have a variety of development styles, ranging from conventional urban development and industrial parks to original rural and modern urban and suburban developments. Most grid squares have a local centre, intended as a retail hub, and many have community facilities as well. Each of the original villages is the heart of its own grid-square. Originally intended under the master plan to sit alongside the grid roads,{{sfnb|Llewellyn-Davies|Weeks|Forestier-Walker|Bor|1970|p=36}} these local centres were mostly in fact built embedded in the communities.{{sfnb|Bendixson|Platt|1992|p=177}}<ref name=Edwards />

Although the 1970 master plan assumed cross-road junctions,{{sfnb|Llewellyn-Davies|Weeks|Forestier-Walker|Bor|1970|p=36}} [[roundabout]] junctions were built at intersections because this type of junction is more efficient at dealing with small to medium volumes. Some major roads are [[dual carriageway]], the others are [[single carriageway]]. Along one side of each single carriageway grid road, there is usually a (grassed) reservation to permit dualling or additional transport infrastructure at a later date.{{efn|An additional ten-metre wide strip was originally specified to satisfy Buckinghamshire County Council's belief in a future fixed-track public transport system. In 1977 MKDC decided to cease to specify it.{{sfnb|Bendixson|Platt|1992|pp=170, 171}}}} {{As of|2018}}, this has been limited to some dualling. The edges of each grid square are landscaped and densely planted{{snd}} some additionally have [[berm|noise attenuation mounds]]{{snd}} to minimise traffic noise from the grid road impacting the adjacent grid square. Traffic movements are fast, with relatively little congestion since there are alternative routes to any particular destination other than during peak periods. The [[national speed limit]] applies on the grid roads, although lower [[speed limit]]s have been introduced on some stretches to reduce accident rates. Pedestrians rarely need to cross grid roads [[At-grade intersection|at grade]], as [[underpass]]es and bridges were specified at frequent places along each stretch of all of the grid roads.{{sfnb|Llewellyn-Davies|Weeks|Forestier-Walker|Bor|1970|p=36}} In contrast, the later districts planned by [[English Partnerships]] have departed from this model, without a road hierarchy but with conventional junctions with traffic lights and at grade pedestrian crossings.<ref name=Guardian100516 /><ref>{{cite news |url=http://urbaneden.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/p17-october-2012.pdf |  work=Milton Keynes Business Week |  first=Theo |  last=Chalmers |  title=The curse of the living planners |  date=19 September 2012 |  access-date=14 May 2019 |  archive-date=13 May 2019 |  archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190513194121/http://urbaneden.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/p17-october-2012.pdf |  url-status=live }}</ref>{{efn|The 'western expansion area' is what became [[Fairfields]] and [[Whitehouse, Milton Keynes|Whitehouse]].

The [[Floodplain|flood plains]] of the [[River Great Ouse|Great Ouse]] and of its tributaries (the [[River Ouzel|Ouzel]] and some brooks) have been protected as [[linear park]]s that run right through Milton Keynes; these were identified as important landscape and flood-management assets from the outset.{{sfnb|Llewellyn-Davies|Weeks|Forestier-Walker|Bor|1970|p=27}} At {{convert|1650|ha|abbr=on|order=flip}}{{snd}} ten times larger than London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and a third larger than [[Richmond Park]]{{sfnb|Bendixson|Platt|1992|p=174}}{{snd}} the landscape architects realised that the [[Royal Parks of London|Royal Park]]s model would not be appropriate or affordable and drew on their [[National parks of England and Wales|National Park]] experience.{{sfnb|Bendixson|Platt|1992|p=174}} As Bendixson and Platt (1992) write: "They divided the Ouzel Valley into 'strings, beads and settings'. The 'strings' are well-maintained routes, be they for walking, bicycling or riding; the 'beads' are sports centres, lakeside cafes and other activity areas; the 'settings' are self-managed land-uses such as woods, riding paddocks, a golf course and a farm".{{sfnb|Bendixson|Platt|1992|p=174}}

The initial [[park system]] was planned by Peter Youngman (Chief [[landscape architect|Landscape Architect]]),<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/17/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1 |title=Peter Youngman, Architect of the modern British landscape |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=17 June 2005 |access-date=23 January 2017 |archive-date=2 February 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202111054/https://www.theguardian.com/news/2005/jun/17/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries1 |url-status=live }}</ref>  who also developed landscape precepts for all development areas: groups of grid squares were to be planted with different selections of trees and shrubs to give them distinct identities.

==Education==
===Schools===
In early planning, education provision was carefully integrated into the development plans with the intention that school journeys would, as far as possible, be made by walking and cycling. Each residential grid square was provided with a primary school (ages 5 to 8) for c.240 children, and for each two squares there was a middle school (ages 8 to 12) for c.480 children. For each eight squares there was a large secondary education campus, to contain between two and four schools for a total of 3,000 – 4,500 children. A central resource area served all the schools on a campus. In addition, each campus included a leisure centre with indoor and outdoor sports facilities and a swimming pool, plus a theatre. These facilities were available to the public outside school hours, thus maximising use of the investment.<ref>{{cite conference|last=Cooksey |first=G. W. | title = The Scope Of Education And Its Opportunities For The 80s | conference = Goldsmiths College March Education Conference |date= 6 March 1976| pages= 8–10 |editor-first=A.

Some schools have since been merged and sites sold for development, many converted to academies, and the leisure centres outsourced to commercial providers.

===Geology===
Its surface geology is primarily gently rolling [[Oxford clay]] or, more formally:

{{blockquote|...&nbsp;a portion of more or less dissected [[boulder clay]] plateau, with streams falling fairly steeply to the [Great] Ouse and Ouzel flood plains, across slopes cut chiefly in Oxford clay. [[Middle Jurassic]] rocks, in particular the [[Blisworth Limestone Formation|Blisworth limestone]] and [[cornbrash]], form strong features in the lands bordering the Ouse valley in the north.<ref>{{citation |url=https://www.bgs.ac.uk/data/publications/pubs.cfc?method=viewRecord&publnId=19864650 |title=The geology of the new town of Milton Keynes |publisher=[[Natural Environment Research Council]] Institute of Geological Sciences |last1=Horton |first1=A. |last2=Coleman |first2=B.

===Parks and environmental infrastructure===
Because of the (poorly drained) clay soils and the urban hard surfaces, the [[Milton Keynes Development Corporation|development corporation]] identified water runoff into the Ouzel and its tributaries as a significant risk to be managed and so put in place two large balancing lakes ([[Caldecotte Lake|Caldecotte]] and [[Willen Lake|Willen]]) and a number of smaller [[detention pond]]s.<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/news/city-has-been-built-to-avoid-worst-flooding-1-5873959 | title= City has been built to avoid worst flooding | work= [[Milton Keynes Citizen]] | date= 13 February 2014 | access-date= 15 April 2019 | archive-date= 14 April 2019 | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190414231039/https://www.miltonkeynes.co.uk/news/city-has-been-built-to-avoid-worst-flooding-1-5873959 | url-status= live }}</ref> These provide an important leisure amenity for most of the year.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.theparkstrust.com/activities/ | title=Activities | publisher=[[Milton Keynes Parks Trust]] | access-date=7 May 2019 | archive-date=7 May 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190507114336/https://www.theparkstrust.com/activities/ | url-status=live }}</ref> Building in the floodplains of the Ouse and Ouzel was precluded too, thus providing long-distance linear parks that are within easy reach of most residents.
