==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Landing Fields - Philippines - Luzon Island - NARA - 68160898.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Calamba landing field, circa 1940s]]

The oldest part of Calamba is believed to be Barangay Sucol where its first settlers remained. With the arrival of Spaniards, the whole area was converted into a hacienda, then a part of Tabuco (present-day [[Cabuyao]]). In 1639 Calamba was the site of a rebellion of Chinese farmers, who had been forcibly resettled there by Governor Sebastián Hurtado de Corcuera. This rebellion spread north of the Pasig River and eventually culminated in the deaths of over 20,000 Chinese in the whole region surrounding Manila. Calamba became an independent ''pueblo'' on August 28, 1742, and formed into the town of Calamba in 1770. In 1813, Calamba was placed in the hands of "''encargados''" by the Dominican Brothers, who divided it into portions and sold the haciendas to the natives during the American regime.<ref name=profile>{{cite web |title=City profile |url=http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/City-Profile/ |work=About the City |publisher=Official Website of the City of Calamba |access-date=November 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140603144106/http://calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/City-Profile/ |archive-date=June 3, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="pol-his">{{cite web |title=Political History |url=http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/Government/Political-History/ |work=City Government |publisher=Official Website of the City of Calamba |access-date=November 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023001341/http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/Government/Political-History/ |archive-date=October 23, 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

===[[World War II]]===
During the Japanese occupation in [[World War II]], Calamba was the location of a [[massacre]] committed by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]], in which at least 2,000 civilians were killed.<ref>Jintaro Ishida,'' The Remains of War'', 2001, p.238, citing the Barangay Real Memorial.</ref> The [[St. John the Baptist Parish Church (Calamba)|St. John the Baptist Church]], established in 1859, was burned by the Japanese during World War II. It was reconstructed by Fr. Eliseo Dimaculangan. It was the christening site of [[José Rizal]]. The original baptismal font has been preserved and refurbished.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
After a process of more than seven years, Calamba became the second component city of the Laguna by virtue of Republic Act No. 9024, "''An Act Converting the Municipality of Calamba, Province of Laguna into a Component City to be known as the City of Calamba''."<ref name=ra9024>{{cite PH act|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/2001/03/05/republic-act-no-9024|title=An Act Converting the Municipality of Calamba, Province of Laguna Into A Component City to be Known as the City of Calamba|chamber=RA|number=9024|publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|The Official Gazette]]|date=2001-03-05|accessdate=2023-11-29}}</ref> R.A. 9024 was signed into law by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] on March 5, 2001, at the [[Malacañan Palace]]. The [[Commission on Elections (Philippines)|Commission on Elections]] (COMELEC) then set the [[plebiscite]] for Calamba's cityhood on April 21, 2001, where 15,056 residents participated. 3,413 or 22.67% voted "''No''" while the remaining 77.33% voted "''Yes"'' to Calamba's conversion into a component city.<ref name=":0" />

====Events leading to Cityhood====
As early as 1994, the town's Sangguniang Bayan approved Resolution No. 60, Series of 1994 requesting the [[Senate of the Philippines]] through its president and the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] through its speaker to co-sponsor a bill for Calamba's conversion into a city. It was only after two years that another resolution, Resolution No. 115 was passed requesting then [[Jun Chipeco, Jr.|Congressman Joaquin M. Chipeco]] Jr, to co-sponsor a bill for Calamba's cityhood and requesting the Sangguniang Panlalawigan for their comments and recommendations regarding the matter. Another two years passed before House Bill No. 986 and Senate bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 were filed in the House of Representatives by Congressman Chipeco and Senate of the Philippines by Senators [[Franklin M. Drilon]] and [[Sergio Osmeña III]], respectively.

It was only in the year 2000 that the motion for Calamba's cityhood was fast-tracked. Then Mayor Severino J. Lajara requested favorable endorsement of House Bill No. 986 from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan on January 3, 2000. The Sangguniang Bayan also endorsed House Bill No. 986 and Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and also requested favorable endorsement from the Sangguniang Panlalawigan in the same month. A month passed and Mayor Lajara sent a follow-up letter to then Vice Governor [[Teresita S. Lazaro|Teresita "Ningning" Lazaro]] on updates regarding the matter.

On March 8, the House Committee on Local Government approved House Bill No. 986 on 2nd reading at a hearing held at Hotel Rembrandt, [[Quezon City]]. The same House Committee conducted a public hearing on House Bill No. 986 at the Calamba Elementary School (Central II) gymnasium on March 23, approving the House Bill in principle. House Bill 986 was deliberated in April by the House of Representatives in plenary session and approved as House Bill No. 10661, which was then filed with the [[Senate of the Philippines]] in June.

The year [[2001]] came and brought about approval on 2nd reading of Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and House Bill No. 10661 in a hearing held on February 5 at the Ambrocio Padilla Hall, Senate of the Philippines. Three days later, February 8, Senate Bill Nos. 1630 and 1791 and House Bill No. 10661 was deliberated in Plenary Session and was approved as Republic Act No. 9024.<ref name=":0">Cityhood of Calamba http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/Cityhood-of-Calamba/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208132408/http://www.calambacity.gov.ph/About-the-City/Cityhood-of-Calamba/ |date=December 8, 2013}}</ref>

Like other cities in the [[Philippines]], Calamba is governed by a city mayor and city vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms. The city mayor is the executive head who leads the city's departments in the execution of city ordinances and in the delivery of public services. The city vice mayor heads a legislative council that is composed of 14 members: 12 councilors and two ''ex-officio'' offices: one for the [[Sangguniang Kabataan|Sangguniang Kabataan Federation]] President, representing the youth sector, and one for the [[Liga ng mga Barangay|Association of Barangay Chairmen]] President as the barangay sectoral representative. The council is in charge of creating the city's policies in the form of ordinances and resolutions.

===City seal===
[[File:Calamba, Laguna Seal.svg|156x156px|Official Calamba city seal|right]]

The silhouette image of rice field on the left and the industrial buildings on the right symbolizing Calamba's rapid modernization, urbanization, and industrialization. With both signs located beside each other, it shows everyone that nature and progress can efficiently coexist in Calamba.

* '''Red '''– This symbolizes the burning patriotism of residents as exemplified by Rizal.
* '''Blue '''– As land and water represent wealth and prosperity, the color blue signifies productivity and tranquility of the constituents.
* '''Silver grey '''– This represents the transformation of development from an agricultural pueblo in the 1700s to an agro-industrial town in the 1900s and finally to an industrial city.
* '''White '''– This projects purity, transparency, efficiency and prudence pertaining to governance.
* Calamba has a golden edge etched at the upper half with the words '''Lungsod ng Calamba''' depicting Calamba as a Philippine component city. Laguna at the bottom part means that Calamba is still part of Laguna province.

A park built to commemorate José Rizal, [[Rizal Monument (Calamba)|Rizal Park]] (or the Plaza) hosts a {{convert|22|ft}} tall statue of Rizal, with the number symbolizing the 22 languages and dialects used by Rizal. The statue sits on top of a 15-step podium, symbolizing one decade since Rizal was born. The monument was once cited as the tallest Jose Rizal Monument in the world,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/lifestyle/05/12/11/rizals-birthplace-now-home-his-tallest-monument|title=Rizal's birthplace now home to his tallest monument|work=ABS-CBN News}}</ref> until a monument of Rizal was built in [[Santa Cruz, Laguna]], for the [[2014 Palarong Pambansa|Palarong Pambansa 2014]]. The monument was inaugurated by [[Benigno Aquino III|President Benigno Aquino III]] in preparation for the Jose Rizal's sesquicentennial birth anniversary on June 19, 2011.

Being near to [[Mount Makiling]], Calamba also hosts hot spring resorts, concentrated at barangays Pansol, Bucal and Bagong Kalsada near the boundary with Los Baños.

==Culture==
===Festivals===
The '''Buhayani Festival''', the official festival of the City of Calamba was the brainchild of Mayor Justin Marc SB. Chipeco during his first year as Mayor in 2013. Mayor Timmy wanted the city to have a festival that will best characterize its culture, progress and tourism potential. He wanted to capitalize on the city's historical heritage as the birthplace of unofficial Philippine National Hero, Dr. Jose P. Rizal. Thus, the Buhayani Festival was born.

The term '''"Buhayani"''' was coined by joining two Filipino words, ''"buhay"'' meaning life or the state of being alive and lively and ''"bayani"'' or hero. The festival's tagline '''"Buhay ng Bayani, Buháy na Bayani"''' literally translates to '''"Life of the Hero"'''pertaining to the life of our famous kababayan, Dr. Jose Rizal and '''"Living Hero"'''which refers to the common man who has the capacity and potential to become everyday heroes in their own small ways.

"We want everyone who revere our kababayan, Dr. Jose Rizal to come to Calamba and join us in honouring him on his birthday and in celebrating the modern Rizal in us. We want to make our National Hero modern and relevant in today's challenging times and we want to celebrate the spirit of heroism that lives in each Filipino, not just in us Calambeños," Mayor Chipeco was quoted saying.

Different activities were lined up for this year's Buhayani Festival: Kuwentong Bayani for selected Grade 5 students, Talinong Rizal Quiz Bee, Buhayani Football Cup, Independence Day Job Fair, SayawIndak Street Dancing Competition, Marching Band Competition, Baile de Gala, Hawig Rizal (Rizal Look-a-Like), Buhayani Eye Care Mission, and a whole lot more. Highlighting this year's celebration is the Morning Program wherein Philippine National Police Chief, Director General Ronald "Bato" Dela Rosa is the Guest of Honor and Speaker. A special wreath-laying ceremony shall also commence at the Museo ni Rizal sa Calamba after a simultaneous floral offering at five different Rizal monuments around the city.

"Jose Rizal is not just the pride of Calamba, he is the pride of the entire country as he was the Greatest Malay to have lived. His works, teachings and ideals have inspired and will continue to inspire us as we strive to live up to his ideals of nationalism and love of country. In the Buhayani Festival, we celebrate an ideal and an advocacy that through this festival, we can rekindle the fire of patriotism and heroism in the hearts of every Filipino. Come to Calamba – retrace history's footsteps, rediscover the richness and uniqueness of our heritage, fire up our Filipino pride and be inspired to share and spread what you have experienced and be part of the force that will bring about a renewed love of country in every Filipino," Mayor Chipeco challenged.
