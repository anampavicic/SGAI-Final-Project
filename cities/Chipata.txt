==Overview==
Having a modern market, a central hospital, shopping malls, a university, some colleges and a number of schools, Chipata is the business and administrative hub of the region. The town boasts a four star hotel, a [[golf course]], an [[Chipata Airport|airport]], and a [[arch|"welcome arch"]]. Developed areas includes Kalongwezi, Moth, and Little Bombay.

Chipata is the regional head of the [[Ngoni people|Ngoni]] of Zambia. The Ngoni adopted the languages of the tribes they conquered, so Chewa and Nsenga are the principal languages, although Tumbuka and [[English language|English]] are widely spoken, plus some Indian languages, as a large number of [[Indians in Zambia|Zambian Indians]] live in the town. It is located near the border with [[Malawi]], and lies on the [[Great East Road (Zambia)|Great East Road]] which connects the capitals [[Lilongwe]] {{convert|150|km|0}} to the east,<ref name="3R"/> and [[Lusaka]] {{convert|570|km|0}} to the west.<ref name="4R"/> It is a popular access point for the [[South Luangwa National Park]], which is {{convert|100|km|0}} to the north-west.

== History ==
Chipata's name comes from the Chewa word "Chimpata" meaning "large space", in reference to the town's situation in a shallow valley between hills. The name of the central neighbourhood of Kapata, the original centre of town, comes from the Chewa word meaning "small space."

Chipata was formerly known as '''Fort Jameson''' (and informally as "Fort Jimmy"), being named after [[Sir Leander Starr Jameson]], the 19th-century British politician and adventurer. Even during the colonial period, few supported that Jameson, who is mainly known for his part in the infamous [[Jameson Raid]], fully deserved the honour of having any town named after him. Like [[Mchinji|'Fort Manning']] and '[[Mansa, Zambia|Fort Rosebery]]', Fort Jameson was called a "fort" because the local government offices, or [[Boma (enclosure)|"Boma"]], were once fortified.

Fort Jameson was the capital of the [[British protectorate]] of [[North-Eastern Rhodesia]] between 1900 and 1911.

During [[World War II]], 80 [[Polish people|Polish]] refugees escaping from [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German- and Soviet-occupied Poland]], were admitted in Fort Jameson in 1941.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wróbel|first=Janusz|title=Uchodźcy polscy ze Związku Sowieckiego 1942–1950|year=2003|language=pl|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance|Instytut Pamięci Narodowej]]|location=[[Łódź]]|page=137|isbn=978-83-7629-522-0}}</ref>

=== Rail ===
An extension of the [[Sena railway]], connecting the city of Chipata to the territory of Malawi (via Mchinji) was opened in August 2011.<ref name="7R">{{cite web|date=21 September 2011 | url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/36610 |title=Zambia, Malawi finally connected by rail |access-date=23 November 2018 | publisher=Afrol.com |location=Kroderen, Norway}}</ref> Since then, Chipata acts as the Zambian railhead and entry point from Malawi and beyond.

The route provides an alternative to two existing rail routes to the Indian Ocean, at [[Dar es Salaam]] and [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]]. In 2015 it was proposed to build a rail link from Chipata through [[Petauke]] to [[Serenje]], a town on the [[TAZARA Railway]] line.<ref name="10R">{{cite web|url=http://breezefmchipata.com/?p=9367 | title=Chipata-Tazara railway project hits a snag |date=3 August 2017 |publisher=Breeze FM Chipata | access-date=23 November 2018 |location=Chipata, Zambia}}</ref>

=== Road ===
The T4 road ([[Great East Road]]) connects Chipata with [[Lusaka]] to the west (570 kilometres away) and the [[Mwami, Zambia|Mwami]] border with [[Malawi]] to the east (20 kilometres away).<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=Roads and Road Traffic Act  |url=https://www.parliament.gov.zm/node/1492 |access-date=2022-06-27 |website=www.parliament.gov.zm}}</ref>

The Luangwa river rises in the Lilonda and [[Mafinga Hills]] in north-east [[Zambia]] at an elevation of around 1500 meters near the border with [[Tanzania]] and [[Malawi]], and flows in a southwesterly direction through a broad valley.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Luangwa River In Zambia|url=https://www.victoriafalls-zambiatravel-safaris.com/country-info/rivers/luangwa-river|website=AfricanMecca Safaris|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-30}}</ref> The water from the streams and the Luangwa river is used for farming by the inhabitants around the district.
