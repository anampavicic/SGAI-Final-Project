During the [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]], Livorno was designed as an "[[ideal town]]". Developing considerably from the second half of the [[16th century]] by the will of the [[House of Medici]], Livorno was an important [[free port]]. Its intense commercial activity was largely dominated by foreign traders. Also the seat of consulates and shipping companies, it became the main port-city of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Grenet|first=Mathieu|title=Livorno, 1680–1845|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-de-l-ofce-2015-4-page-281.htm}}</ref> The high status of a multiethnic and multicultural Livorno lasted until the second half of the nineteenth century, when it was surpassed by other cities. Evidence of that prosperous time can be seen in the many churches, villas, and palaces of the city.<ref name="treccanilivorno" />

Livorno is considered to be the most modern among all the Tuscan cities, and is the third most-populous of the region, after [[Florence]] and [[Prato]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rivista Geografica Italiana, volume 65|pages=197|language=it}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Comuni della Toscana per popolazione|url=https://www.tuttitalia.it/toscana/19-comuni/popolazione/|access-date=2020-11-10|website=Tuttitalia.it|language=it}}</ref>

[[File:Livorno map 17th Century.jpg|left|thumb|350px|Fortifications of Livorno in the 17th century]]

===Origins===
The origins of Livorno are controversial, although the place was inhabited since the [[Neolithic]] Age. This is documented by the worked bones, and pieces of copper and ceramic found on the [[Livorno Hills]] in a cave between Ardenza and Montenero. The [[Etruscan cities|Etruscan]] settlement was called Labro.<ref>P. Vigo, ''Livorno'', Bergamo 1915, p. 15-24.</ref> 

The construction of the [[Via Aurelia]] coincided with the occupation of the region by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. They are also known for their [[toponymy|toponyms]] and the ruins of towers. The natural cove called Liburna is a reference to the type of ship, the [[liburna]], adopted by [[Roman navy]] from the [[Liburnians]]. Other ancient toponyms include ''Salviano'' (Salvius) and ''Antignano'' (Ante ignem), which was the place situated before ''Ardenza'' (Ardentia), where beacons directed the ships to [[Porto Pisano]]. [[Cicero]] mentioned Liburna in a letter to his brother, in which he called it [[Labrone]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5yoTAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA346 |title=M. Tullii Ciceronis epistolae ad Atticum: ad Quintum fratrem et quae vulgo ad familiares dicuntur|access-date=6 August 2012|last1=Cicero|first1=Marcus Tullius|year=1836}}</ref>

=== Medieval ===
Livorna is mentioned for the first time in 1017 as a small coastal village, the port and the remains of a Roman tower under the rule of [[Lucca]]. In 1077, a tower was built by [[Matilda of Tuscany]]. The [[Republic of Pisa]] owned Livorna from 1103 and built a quadrangular fort called ''Quadratura dei Pisani'' ("Quarter of the Pisans") to defend the port.<ref name=treccanilivorno/> ''Porto Pisano'' was destroyed after the crushing defeat of the Pisan fleet in the [[Battle of Meloria (1284)|Battle of Meloria]] in 1284.<ref>Vaccari et al, p. 28</ref> 

In 1399, Pisa sold Livorna to the [[Visconti of Milan]]; in 1405 it was sold to the [[Republic of Genoa]]; and on 28 August 1421 it was bought by the [[Republic of Florence]].<ref name=treccanilivorno>{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/livorno_(Enciclopedia-Italiana)/|title=LIVORNO in "Enciclopedia Italiana"|website=www.treccani.it|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> The name 'Leghorn' was derived from the [[Genoese dialect|Genoese]] name Ligorna.<ref name="Ciccone">Si veda in proposito G. Ciccone, ''Livorno: il mistero del nome'', in "Il Pentagono", n. 11, novembre 2009.</ref> ''Livorno'' was used certainly in the eighteenth century by Florentines.<ref name="Ciccone" />

Between 1427 and 1429, a census counted 118 families in Livorno, including 423 persons. Monks, Jews, military personnel, and the homeless were not included in the census.<ref>Vaccari et al, p. 42</ref> The only remainder of medieval Livorno is a fragment of two towers and a wall, located inside the [[#Fortezza Vecchia|Fortezza Vecchia]].

===Medicean period (1500–1650)===
After the arrival of the [[House of Medici|Medici]], the ruling dynasty of Florence, some modifications were made in the city. Between 1518 and 1534 the ''[[Old Fortress, Livorno|Fortezza Vecchia]]'' was constructed, and the voluntary resettlement of the population to Livorno was stimulated. Livorno still remained a rather insignificant coastal fortress.<ref>Vaccari et al, p. 48</ref> By 1551, the population had grown to 1562 residents.<ref name=treccanilivorno/>

Seat of the crusading and corsairing [[Order of Saint Stephen]] after 1561, distinctive for its aggressive approach towards the Muslim world, Livorno became a major Mediterranean [[History of slavery|slave trade]] hub in the early modern period, rivalling Malta's.<ref>{{Cite book|page=872|title=Critical Readings on Global Slavery|editor-first=Damian Alan|editor-last=Pargas|editor-first2=Felicia|editor-last2=Roşu|chapter=The Geography of Slaving in the Early Modern Mediterranean, 1500–1800|isbn=978-90-04-34654-3 |year=2018|location=Leiden|publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]]|first=Robert|last=Davis}}</ref> Its share of slave population may have been over a 25% of the population.{{Sfn|Davis|2018|p=873}}

During the [[Italian Renaissance]], when the settlement was ruled by the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] of the [[House of Medici]], Livorno was designed as an "[[Ideal town]]".<ref name=treccanilivorno/> In 1577 the architect [[Bernardo Buontalenti]] drew up the first plan.<ref name=treccanilivorno/> The new fortified town had a [[pentagonal]] design, for which it is called ''[[#Pentagono del Buontalenti|Pentagono del Buontalenti]]'', incorporating the original settlement. The ''[[Port of Livorno#Porto Mediceo|Porto Mediceo]]'' was overlooked and defended by [[tower]]s and fortresses leading to the [[town centre]].

In the late 1580s, [[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]], declared Livorno a [[List of free ports|free port]] (''porto franco''), which meant that the goods traded here were [[Duty-free shop|duty-free]] within the area of the town's control. 

In 1593, the Duke's administration established the ''Leggi Livornine'' to regulate trade.<ref name=treccanilivorno/> These laws protected merchant activities from crime and [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], and instituted laws regarding [[international trade]]. The laws established a well-regulated market and were in force until 1603. Also expanding Christian tolerance, the laws offered the right of public [[freedom of religion]] and [[amnesty]] to people having to gain [[penance]] from clergy in order to conduct civil business. The Grand Duke attracted numerous Turks, Persians, Moors, Greeks, and Armenians, along with [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants. Sephardic Jews began to immigrate to Livorno in the late sixteenth century, following the [[Alhambra Decree]] and expulsion of Jews from Spain and Portugal. Livorno extended rights and privileges to them, and they contributed greatly to the mercantile wealth and scholarship in the city.

Livorno became an enlightened European city and one of the most important ports of the entire [[Mediterranean Basin]]. Many European [[Alien (law)|foreigner]]s moved to Livorno. These included Christian Protestant reformers who supported such leaders as [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], and others. [[French people|French]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], and English arrived, along with Orthodox [[Greeks]]. Meanwhile, Jews continued to trade under their previous treaties with the Grand Duke. On 19 March 1606, Ferdinando I de' Medici elevated Livorno to the rank of city; the ceremony was held in the ''Fortezza Vecchia'' Chapel of [[Francis of Assisi]].
[[File:Chiesa Santa Caterina, Livorno.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Santa Caterina (Livorno)|Santa Caterina, Livorno]]]]

The [[Counter-Reformation]] increased tensions among Christians; dissidents to the [[Pope|Papacy]] were targeted by various Catholic absolute rulers. Livorno's tolerance declined during the [[European wars of religion]]. But, in the preceding period, the merchants of Livorno had developed a series of trading networks with Protestant Europe, and the Dutch, British, and Germans worked to retain these. In 1653 a naval battle, the [[Battle of Leghorn]], was fought near Livorno during the [[First Anglo-Dutch War]].

===17th century and later===
At the end of the 17th century, Livorno underwent a period of great [[urban planning]] and expansion. Near the defensive pile of the Old Fortress, a new fortress was built, together with the town walls and the system of navigable canals through neighbourhoods. After the port of [[Pisa]] had silted up in the 13th century, its distance from the sea increased and it lost its dominance in trade. Livorno took over as the main port in [[Tuscany]]. By 1745 Livorno's population had risen to 32,534 persons.<ref name=treccanilivorno/>

The more successful of the European powers re-established trading houses in the region, especially the British with the [[Levant Company]]. In turn, the trading networks grew, and with those, Britain's cultural contact with Tuscany. An increasing number of British writers, artists, philosophers, and travellers visited the area and developed the unique historical ties between the two communities. The British referred to the city in English as "Leghorn", derived from the Genoese term. Through the centuries, the city's trade fortunes fell and rose according to the success or failure of the Great Powers. The British and their Protestant allies were important to its trade.

[[File:Livorno map of the town (1849) by Guesdon 01.jpg|thumb|275px|Bird's-eye view of Livorno in the mid 19th century.]]

During the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars]] of the late eighteenth century, Napoleon's troops occupied Livorno along with the rest of Tuscany. Under the [[Continental System]], the French prohibited trade with Britain, and the economy of Livorno suffered greatly. The French had altogether taken over Tuscany by 1808, incorporating it into the Napoleonic empire. After the [[Congress of Vienna]], Austrian rule replaced the French.

In 1861, [[Italy]] succeeded in its [[Unification of Italy|wars of unification]]. At that time the city counted 96,471 inhabitants.<ref name=treccanilivorno/> Livorno and [[Tuscany]] became part of the new [[Kingdom of Italy]] and, as part of the Kingdom, the town lost its status as a free port. The city's commercial importance declined.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Livorno had numerous [[Urban park|public park]]s housing important museums such as the ''[[#Museo Civico "Giovanni Fattori"|Museo Civico Giovanni Fattori]]'', ''[[#Museo di storia naturale del Mediterraneo|Museo di storia naturale del Mediterraneo]]'', and [[cultural institution]]s as the ''[[#Biblioteca Labronica|Biblioteca Labronica F.D. Guerrazzi]]'' and others in [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical style]] as ''[[Cisternoni of Livorno#La Gran Conserva|Cisternone]]'', ''Teatro Goldoni'' and [[Liberty style]] as ''Palazzo Corallo'', ''[[Market (place)|Mercato]] delle Vettovaglie'', ''[[Thermae|Stabilimento termale Acque]] della Salute'', the ''[[Primary education#Italy|Scuole elementari]] Benci'' all the last on project by Angiolo Badaloni.
 
In the early 19th century, the American [[Elizabeth Ann Seton]] converted from Protestantism to Catholicism while visiting Italian friends in Livorno. She later was canonized as the first American-born saint.

During the 1930s, numerous [[villa]]s were built on the avenue along the sea in [[Art Nouveau|Liberty style]] based on designs by Cioni.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.comune.livorno.it/_cn_online/index.php?id=284&lang=it | title = Il liberty di Livorno | publisher = Comune Notizie online | access-date = 4 August 2018}}</ref> These added to the architectural richness of the city.

Livorno suffered extensive damage during [[World War II]]. Many historic sites and buildings were destroyed by bombs of the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] preceding their invasion of Italy, including the [[#Cathedral of Saint Francis of Assisi|cathedral]] and [[Synagogue of Livorno]].
 
Since the late 20th century, Livorno's residents have become well known for their [[left-wing politics]]. The [[Italian Communist Party]] was founded in Livorno in 1921.

== Climate ==
Livorno has a hot-summer [[mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''). Summers have warm days with the heat lingering on throughout the night, hence going above the [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] threshold in spite of its relatively high latitude. Winters are mild for the latitude due to the moderating influence from the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Precipitation is in a wet winter/dry summer pattern as with all climates fitting the Mediterranean definition.

====Armenian community====
{{see also|Sceriman family}}
[[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany]] issued in 1591 a decree encouraging [[Armenians]] to settle in Livorno to increase its trade with the Ottoman Empire and western Asia. By the beginning of the 17th century, Armenians operated 120 shops in town.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.italiarmenia.it/sito/index.php?option=com_content&id=46&Itemid=11&limitstart=9|title=Storia in sintesi – Armeni in Italia|last=Administrator|website=www.italiarmenia.it|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> In 1701 the Armenian community, who were members of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]], were authorized to build their own church, which they dedicated to [[Gregory the Illuminator]]. The project was by [[Giovanni Battista Foggini]] and the church was completed a few years later but did not open for worship until 1714.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://livornodellenazioni.wordpress.com/beni-heritage/cult/chiesa-armena_ita/|title=Chiesa armena di San Gregorio Illuminatore|date=24 April 2013|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> The church had a Latin cross plant and a dome at the intersection of the transept and nave. Destroyed during World War II, it was partly restored in 2008 but is not open to worship.

==== Greek community ====
The first [[Greeks]] who settled in Livorno early in the 16th century were former mercenaries in the fleet of [[Cosimo de' Medici]] and their descendants. This community grew and became significant in the 18th and 19th centuries when Livorno became one of the principal hubs of the Mediterranean trade.<ref>[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-19713132/commerce-and-identity-greek.html Vlami Despina (1997) "Commerce and identity in the Greek communities: Livorno in the 18th and 19th centuries. (Identities, Cultures, and Creativity)"], ''Diogenes'', 22 March 1997</ref> Most of the new Greek immigrants came from western Greece, [[Chios]], [[Epirus]] and [[Cappadocian Greeks|Cappadocia]].

Based on its status since the late 16th century as a [[List of free ports|free port]] (''port franc'') and the warehouses constructed for long-term storage of goods and grains from the [[Levant]], until the late 19th century Livorno enjoyed a strong strategic position related to Greek mercantile interests in the [[Black Sea]], the [[Mediterranean Sea]], and the North Atlantic.  The conflicts between Great Britain and France during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] of the early 19th century, with associated port embargoes, piracy, and confiscation of cargoes, played out to the advantage of those Greek merchants willing to accept risk. By the 1820s, Greek entrepreneurs gradually replaced the Protestant British, Dutch, French and other merchants who left the city.

The Greeks concentrated on the grain market, banking and ship-brokering. Cargoes of wheat from the Black Sea were received at Livorno, before being re-shipped to England. Returning ships carried textiles and other industrial goods, which Greek merchants shipped to [[Alexandria]] and other destinations in the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Chians controlled much of the trade. In 1839 Livorno had ten major commercial houses, led primarily by ethnic Greeks and Jewish Italians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harlaftis|first=Gelina|title=A History of Greek-owned Shipping: The Making of an International Tramp Fleet, 1830 to the Present Day|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dA_82ubkRugC&pg=RA1-PA50|year=1996|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-00018-5}}, p. 50</ref>

The ethnic Greek community ({{lang|it|nazione}}) had a distinctive cultural and social identity based on their common [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox religion]], language and history.  In 1775 they established the Confraternity of Holy Trinity ({{lang|it|Confraternita della SS.

;Bagitto
The ''[[Judeo-Italian languages#Dialects|bagitto]]'' was a Judæo-Italian regional dialect once used by the [[History of the Jews in Livorno|Jewish community in Livorno]]. It was a language based on Italian, developed with words coming from Tuscan, Spanish, Portuguese, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]]; the presence of Portuguese and Spanish words is due to the origin of the first Jews who came to Livorno, having been expelled from the Iberian peninsula in the late 15th century.

====''Venezia Nuova''====
[[File:Panorama Venezia Nuova, Livorno.JPG|thumb|360px|''Venezia Nuova'']]

[[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando II de' Medici]] considered, in 1629, the opportunity to enlarge the town, on project by Giovanni Battista Santi, toward north in an area included among ''[[#Fortezza Vecchia|Fortezza Vecchia]]'' and ''[[#Fortezza Nuova|Fortezza Nuova]]'', in order to give an adequate space to the maritime and commercial activities. There was the need to build a mercantile district, close to ''[[Port of Livorno#Porto Mediceo|Porto Mediceo]]'', provided with houses and depots to store the merchandise and a system of canals to facilitate their transport. The new ''[[rione]]'' (district), called ''{{illm|Venezia Nuova|it}}'', was built in an area gained to the sea, intersected by canals and linked to the town with bridges, for this reason, Venetians skilled workers were recruited.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.comune.livorno.it/_cn_online/index.php?page=_layout_default&id=436 |title = Il quartiere della Venezia Nuova |publisher = Comune Notizie online |access-date = 4 August 2018 |archive-date = 20 December 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161220203605/http://www.comune.livorno.it/_cn_online/index.php?page=_layout_default&id=436 |url-status = dead }}</ref>

The ''Chiesa di Sant'Anna'', dedicated to [[Saint Anne]], was built in 1631 on the ground of the Arch confraternity of the Company of the Nativity;<ref>Dario Matteoni, Le città nella storia d’Italia Livorno, p.64, Edizioni Laterza e Belforte Editore Livorno</ref> in the same year Giovanni Battista Santi died and the control of the project passed to Giovanni Francesco Cantagallina though the works slowed down due to the lack of funds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giovanni-francesco-cantagallina_(Dizionario_Biografico)/|title=Cantagallina, Giovanni Francesco in "Dizionario Biografico"|website=www.treccani.it|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref>

A new impulse to the works was given in 1656 concerning the distribution of the spaces where to build other houses and stores; consequently arose the problem of the diverse oriented road scheme with respect to the axis of ''Piazza d’Arme'', it was resolved by adopting a road plan perpendicular to the [[Navicelli channel]]. The paving of the roads and along the canals in ''Venezia Nuova'' was provided in 1668,<ref>Dario Matteoni, Le città nella storia d’Italia Livorno, p.70, Edizioni Laterza e Belforte Editore Livorno</ref> while the ''Pescheria Nuova'' (New fish market) was built in 1705 close to the ''Scali del Pesce'' where the fish was unloaded.

In the 1700s ''Venezia Nuova'' was the district of the Consuls of the Nations and of the most important international retailers who had the warehouses filled with goods from everywhere waiting to be shipped by sea to the most different destinations. The palaces along the canals had the turrets from which to see the ships approaching the port, moreover, they had the stores at the canal level to facilitate the unloading of the goods from the boats.

The ''Venezia Nuova'' district retains much of its original town planning and architectural features such as the bridges, narrow [[lane]]s, the houses of the [[nobility]], churches as [[Santa Caterina da Siena, Livorno|Santa Caterina da Siena]] and [[San Ferdinando, Livorno|San Ferdinando]], and a dense network of canals that once served to link its warehouses to the port.

Ferdinando I commissioned it to Giovanni Bandini in 1595 to carry out a monument in white [[Carrara marble]] to represent him in the uniform of the [[Grand Master (order)|Grand master]] of the [[Order of Saint Stephen]] which in that period prevailed in several naval battles against the [[Barbary pirates]].

During the French occupation of Livorno, from 1796 to 1799, the monument was removed from Sextius Mollis commander of the French garrison because it represented an insult to the [[tyrant|tyranny]], as soon as the French left the town the monument was put back in its former place.<ref name=comunequattro/>

During World War II the monument was transferred to a protected place in order to avoid being damaged by allied attacks, the statue of Ferdinando I was hidden in the [[Pisa Charterhouse]] and the four moors in the [[Poggio a Caiano#The Medici villa|Medici Villa at Poggio a Caiano]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotolivorno.net/Statua_Quattro_Mori_Livorno.html|title=Livorno la statua dei Quattro Mori|website=www.fotolivorno.net|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref>

The new neo-renaissance palace, positioned between ''Palazzo della Dogana'' and ''Palazzo Granducale'' on the north side of ''Piazza d’Arme'', was partially destroyed by the 1742 earthquake. Restored in 1745 by Bernardino Ciurini and Antonio Fabbri a double white marble stairway and a small bell tower on the top of the façade were added. In 1867 the complex was enlarged with the acquisition of three other buildings in the back. With the settlement of the [[Podestà]] in the [[fascist]] period was carried out a new enlargement in 1929 by Enrico Salvais and Luigi Pastore transforming the adjacent former fire station in the council hall.

====''Fortezza Vecchia''====
[[File:Livorno - Fortezza Vecchia.jpg|thumb|''Fortezza Vecchia'']]
The origin of ''[[Old Fortress, Livorno|Fortezza Vecchia]]'' takes place not far from what once was ''Porto Pisano'' (Pisan Port) where a square tower was built in 1077, on request of [[Matilda of Tuscany]], on the remains of a Roman tower; in 1241 the Pisans built a massive cylindrical tower, 30 meters high erroneously called ''[[Keep|Mastio]] di Matilde'' (Matilda keep).

In 1392 this fort was connected to a wall in order to defend better the town and the ''[[Dock (maritime)|Darsena]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webalice.it/sinipapdsl/pano/fortezzav_molo/fortezzav_molo_info.html|title=La Fortezza Vecchia – Informazioni sui luoghi|first=Luca|last=Papini|website=www.webalice.it|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> Livorno, in 1405, was sold to Genoa which reinforced the defences, building three forts under the Quartered, afterwards Livorno was bought from [[Florence]] on 28 August 1421 at the price of 100.000 [[Tuscan florin]].<ref name=treccanilivorno/>
The project to build ''Fortezza Vecchia'' was commissioned to [[Antonio da Sangallo the Elder]] in 1506, the fortress had to incorporate the existing Pisan and Genovese constructions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortezzavecchia.it/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=12&Itemid=1|title=La Fortezza|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref>
[[File:Livorno Fortezza Vecchia bastione della Canaviglia 02 @chesi.JPG|thumb|left|Matilda keep and ''Canaviglia'' bastion]]
The works started in 1518 on the order of [[Pope Clement VII|Cardinal Giulio De' Medici]] under the supervision of ''Nicolao da Pietrasanta''. The construction was suspended since the popular revolt forced the [[House of Medici#16th century|Medici in exile]] and was resumed in 1530 on their return. ''Fortezza Vecchia'' is a massive fortification completed on 1 April 1534 under ''[[Alessandro de' Medici, Duke of Florence|Alessandro de' Medici]]''; it was built in red-brick with sloping walls and the interposition of clear stones, it has a quadrangular plant with a perimeter of 1500 meters and was equipped with 24 cannons to protect each side.<ref name=Livornina/> One of the corners directs inside to join the Quartered of the Pisans and Matilda and Genoa keep; the three others are protected by triangular [[bastion]]s with rounded tips. The bastion towards the north is called ''Capitana'' because there moored the main [[Galley]], to the east is ''Ampolletta'' since housed the sand-glass used to control the guard duty, to the west is the ''Canaviglia'' derived from ''Cavaniglia'' the name of the commander of the galleys of the Grand Ducky of Tuscany. The land on the side toward the town was excavated in order to have the fortress surrounded by the sea for better defence. ''[[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici]]'' built in 1544 an imposing palace, overlooking the ''[[Port of Livorno#Vecchia Darsena|Vecchia Darsena]]'', above the Quartered of the Pisans which went destroyed during World War II. The successor [[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Francesco I de' Medici]] built a small palace toward the sea, later became ''[[Port of Livorno#Porto Mediceo|Porto Mediceo]]'', on the top of Canaviglia bastion situated at the entrance of ''Vecchia Darsena''. On the opposite side was built a church dedicated to Saint Francis where on 19 March 1606 ''[[Ferdinando I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando I de' Medici]]'' elevated Livorno to the status of [[city]].<ref name=Livornina/> ''Fortezza Vecchia'' changed its function to the coming of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany#House of Habsburg-Lorraine|House of Habsburg-Lorraine]] in 1737, by a defensive structure to a military college for officers of the Army of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] (1769) and afterwards in garrison (1795).

====''Fortezza Nuova''====
[[File:Livorno-Fortezza Nuova.jpg|thumb|''Fortezza Nuova'']]
The origin of ''Fortezza Nuova'' (New fortress) take place at the end of the 1500s, by the adjustment of ''Baluardo [[Francis of Assisi|San Francesco]]'' (Saint Francis rampart) and ''Baluardo [[Saint Barbara|Santa Barbara]]'' (Saint Barbara rampant) of the project commissioned by [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I]] to [[Bernardo Buontalenti]] with the intention to develop a new urban plan of the town that led to a pentagonal shape surrounded by canals.

The original project was then modified by [[Don Giovanni de' Medici]], Claudio Cogorano and [[Alessandro Pieroni]] to allow the construction of ''Fortezza Nuova'' in order to strengthen the military apparatus of the town. The works started on 10 January 1590 and ended in 1604, the result is a considerable fortification, in stones and red bricks, with a polygonal plant surrounded by water; the new modification brought to the construction of ''Forte San Pietro'' (Saint Peter fort) to defend the ''Venezia Nuova'' quarter.
<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.comune.livorno.it/_cn_online/index.php?id=176&lang=it |title=Comune di Livorno |access-date=24 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524221749/http://www.comune.livorno.it/_cn_online/index.php?id=176&lang=it |archive-date=24 May 2015 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

In 1629 part of the fortress was demolished to permit the building of ''Venezia Nuova'' and ''San Marco'' quarters wanted by [[Ferdinando II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Ferdinando II]].

====''Pentagono del Buontalenti''====
[[File:Città pentagonale -Copia del progetto di B.Buontalenti-.png|thumb|275px|The copy of the project by Buontalenti]]
[[Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Francesco I de' Medici]] gave to [[Bernardo Buontalenti]] in 1575 the task to project the [[ideal town]] in order to transform Livorno from a fishing village in a fortified town to accommodate 12,000 inhabitants,<ref>[http://babilonia61.com/tag/bernardo-buontalenti/  babilonia61] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528220447/http://babilonia61.com/tag/bernardo-buontalenti/ |date=28 May 2015 }}</ref> to include the original settlement and the ''Fortezza Vecchia'', capable to become the trade centre of the [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]]. The development of the project led to a pentagonal plant as in use in the [[Renaissance]] period, each side 600 meters long, with defensive walls, rampant and five bastions at the vertices, surrounded by canals; the fifth bastion coincided with ''[[#Fortezza Vecchia|Fortezza Vecchia]]''. The plan gave no information regarding the function of the new urban area, indicating only a series of building blocks within a road system absolutely orthogonal, [[cardo]] and [[Decumanus Maximus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vasaribuontalenti-memo.blogspot.it/p/buontalenti-e-livorno.html|title=Buontalenti e l'architettura militare|website=vasaribuontalenti-memo.blogspot.it|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref>
The road axis from north to south (cardo) underline the direction that united the centre of the town with a significant place as the [[Sanctuary of Montenero]]; the axis from west to east (decumanus) linked the ''Baluardo Santa Giulia'' to ''Baluardo Sant’Andrea''.<ref name="architetto livorno">{{cite web|url=http://www.architetto-livorno.com/il-progetto-della-citta/|title=architetto livorno|access-date=30 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528220553/http://www.architetto-livorno.com/il-progetto-della-citta/|archive-date=28 May 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>
In August 1576 was created the Office of the ''Fabbrica di Livorno'' with the task of supervising the construction and Alessandro Puccini was the chief superintendent.<ref>Dario Matteoni, Le città nella storia d’Italia Livorno, p.19, Edizioni Laterza e Belforte Editore Livorno</ref>

Francesco I de' Medici laid the first stone for the construction of the ''Baluardo di San Francesco'' (Saint Francis rampant) of the new town on 28 March 1577; the works went on with several changes compared with the original plan including the construction of the ''[[#Fortezza Nuova|Fortezza Nuova]]''.<ref name="architetto livorno"/>
Livorno became a town, encircled by the navigable ''[[Canal|Fosso]] Reale'' (Royal canal), with numerous palaces, warehouse, garrisons and custom-houses. The central street at that time was ''Via Ferdinanda'' extended for 750 meters, later called ''Via Grande'', from ''[[City gate|Porta]] Colonnella'' (Colonella city gate), in the proximity of ''[[Port of Livorno#Vecchia Darsena|Vecchia Darsena]]'', to ''Porta Pisana'' (Pisan city gate). The ''Baluardo Sant’Andrea'' was initiated in 1578 while the ''Baluardo Santa Giulia'' started in 1582.<ref>Dario Matteoni, Le città nella storia d’Italia Livorno, p.20-21, Edizioni Laterza e Belforte Editore Livorno</ref>

In 1594 it was decided to create a huge square, at halfway of ''Via Ferdinanda'', where to build the church of the new town. The church, which was built in a central position on the south side of ''Piazza d’Arme'', later ''Piazza Grande'', was completed in 1602 under the direction of Antonio Cantagaliina and [[Alessandro Pieroni]]. ''Piazza d’Arme'' was completed and enlarged with the old ''Porticciolo dei Genovesi'' (Port of Genovesi) filled up with earth to make room to the building called ''Tre Palazzi'' (Three palaces); the square was adorned with a series of marble arcades attributed to Alessandro Pieroni.

According to the tradition, the origin of the villa date back to the Medicean period when an edifice was built as a suburban residence for [[Ferdinando II de' Medici]]. ''Villa Fabbricotti'' received the name from its last owner Bernardo Fabbricotti from [[Carrara]], who acquired it from the English merchant Thomas Lloyd in 1881. Fabbricotti, following to adverse economic affairs, sold the Villa and the park to the [[Comune]] in 1936. During World War II the building was used by the German command as headquarters, and later taken by the American forces;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regione.toscana.it/-/villa-fabbricotti|title=Villa Fabbricotti – Giardini Livorno – Regione Toscana|website=www.regione.toscana.it|access-date=30 March 2018}}</ref> in the post-war period was restored in order to adapt it into library.
