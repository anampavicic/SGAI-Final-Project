==History==
[[File:Juan_María_Marrón.jpg|thumb|left|[[Rancho Agua Hedionda]] was granted to [[Juan María Marrón]] in 1842, encompassing modern-day Carlsbad.]]
[[File:JohnFrazier.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Statue of John Frazier]]
Carlsbad's history began with the [[Luiseño people]] (the Spanish name given to them because of their proximity to [[Mission San Luis Rey]]), as well as some [[Kumeyaay]] in the La Costa area. Nearly every reliable fresh water creek had at least one native village, including one called Palamai.<ref name="Robbins-Wade">{{cite web|url=http://www.scahome.org/publications/proceedings/Proceedings.01Robbins.pdf|title= Mary Robbins-Wade, COASTAL LUISENO: REFINING THE SAN LUIS REY COMPLEX, Articles of the SCA Proceedings, Volume 1, Society for California Archaeology, 1988, p.75 "The site is located within Luiseno territory according to ethnographic maps by Kroeber (1925), White (1963), and True, Meighan, and Crew (1974). The site and nearby satellites may be the village of Palamai, mapped by Kroeber (1925)."}}</ref>  The site is located just south of today's [[Buena Vista Lagoon]].<ref name="Robbins-Wade"/>

The first European land exploration of [[Alta California]], the Spanish [[Portolá expedition]] of 1769, met native villagers while camped on Buena Vista Creek.<ref>{{cite book |last=Bolton |first=Herbert E. |pages=128 |year=1927 |title=Fray Juan Crespi, Missionary Explorer on the Pacific Coast, 1769-1774 |url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000288788 |publisher=HathiTrust Digital Library}}</ref> Another Luiseño villages within today's city of Carlsbad was a village at the mouth of the San Marcos Creek that the [[Kumeyaay]] called 'Ajopunquile'. A Kumeyaay village that was visited by Portolá was Hakutl, in the Rancho Ponderosa area.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carrico|first=Richard L.|date=July 1, 1977|title=Portola's 1769 Expedition and Coastal Native Villages of San Diego County|url=https://escholarship.org/uc/item/68k9x90h|journal=The Journal of California Anthropology|language=en|volume=4|issue=1}}</ref>

During the Mexican period, in 1842, the southern portion of Carlsbad was granted as [[Rancho Agua Hedionda]] to [[Juan María Marrón]].

In the 1880s a former sailor named [[John A. Frazier]] dug a well in the area. He began offering his water at the train station and soon the whistle-stop became known as Frazier's Station. A test done on a second fresh-water well discovered the water to be chemically similar to that found in some of the most renowned spas in the world, and the town was named after the famed spa in the [[Bohemia]]n town of Karlsbad (now [[Karlovy Vary]], [[Czech Republic]]).<ref>[http://www.carlsbadca.gov/about/history/Pages/default.aspx#layout-tab-2 City of Carlsbad - History of Carlsbad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121106010142/http://www.carlsbadca.gov/about/history/Pages/default.aspx#layout-tab-2 |date=November 6, 2012 }}, retrieved March 1, 2012.</ref>

To take advantage of the find, the Carlsbad Land and Mineral Water Company was formed by a German-born merchant from the Midwest named Gerhard Schutte together with Samuel Church Smith, D. D. Wadsworth and Henry Nelson. The naming of the town followed soon after, along with a major marketing campaign to attract visitors. The area experienced a period of growth, with homes and businesses sprouting up in the 1880s. Agricultural development of citrus fruits, avocados and olives soon changed the landscape. By the end of 1887, land prices fell throughout [[San Diego County, California|San Diego County]]. However, the community survived on the back of its fertile agricultural lands.

The site of John Frazier's original well can still be found at ''Alt Karlsbad,'' a replica of a German [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] house, located on Carlsbad Boulevard.

In 1952, Carlsbad was incorporated to avoid annexation by its neighbor, [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]].<ref>[http://www.carlsbadhistoricalsociety.com/Carlsbad%20Historical%20Society_files/historical/battle_for_incorporation.htm The Battle for Incorporation], at the [http://www.carlsbadhistoricalsociety.com/ Carlsbad Historical Society], retrieved January 12, 2014.</ref>

For city planning and growth management purposes, Carlsbad is divided into four distinct quadrants.<ref>[http://www.carlsbadca.gov/services/departments/planning/Documents/DMR.QuadrantDwelling.pdf Quadrant Map] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506193046/http://www.carlsbadca.gov/services/departments/planning/Documents/DMR.QuadrantDwelling.pdf |date=May 6, 2012 }}, available at the City of Carlsbad's [http://www.carlsbadca.gov/services/departments/planning/Pages/growth-management.aspx Growth Management page] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316185510/http://www.carlsbadca.gov/services/departments/planning/Pages/growth-management.aspx |date=March 16, 2012 }}, retrieved March 1, 2012.</ref>

====Northwest quadrant====
The northwest quadrant of Carlsbad (ZIP code 92008) includes the downtown "Village", "The Barrio", and "Olde Carlsbad." It was the first part of Carlsbad to be settled. Homes range from 1950s cottages and bungalows, 1960s ranch style houses, to elegant mansions on hills overlooking the ocean. It is also home to Hosp Grove Park, a grove of eucalyptus trees relatively untouched by development and now designated by the city for recreational use, in addition to the Buena Vista and Agua Hedionda Lagoons. It is located west of [[California county routes in zone S#S11|El Camino Real]] and north of [[California county routes in zone S#S12|Palomar Airport Road]].

"The Barrio" area is near downtown Carlsbad bordered by Carlsbad Village Drive to the north, Tamarack Avenue to the south, Interstate 5 to the east and the railroad tracks to the west. It was settled by [[Latino (demonym)|Latinos]] in the early 20th century.<ref name=barrio>[http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/article_976b0ce1-e315-5e19-b05e-f4fab0e7386e.html New effort begins on planning for Carlsbad's Barrio area] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101021223211/http://www.nctimes.com/news/local/article_976b0ce1-e315-5e19-b05e-f4fab0e7386e.html |date=October 21, 2010 }}, in ''[http://www.nctimes.com/ North County Times]'', retrieved October 19, 2011.</ref> It is the site of the Centro de Aprendizaje, a Spanish division of the [[Carlsbad City Library]].<ref name=centro>[http://www.carlsbadca.gov/services/departments/library/espanol/Pages/default.aspx Las Bibliotecas de Carlsbad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111011071356/http://www.carlsbadca.gov/services/departments/library/espanol/Pages/default.aspx |date=October 11, 2011 }}, retrieved October 19, 2011.</ref>

====Northeast quadrant====
This quadrant (ZIP code 92010) is located east of El Camino Real and north of Palomar Airport Road and consists mostly of single-family homes, with larger lots found in the older area known as Chestnut Hills and the newer developments around Calavera Hills.

The Northeast quadrant also contains the Lake Calavera Nature Preserve, a 110-acre space containing a 513-foot extinct volcano known as [[Cerro de la Calavera|Mount Calavera]]. The preserve — notable for its small lake, wide dam, and mountain — was officially set aside in the 1990s as the surrounding land was being developed. The preserve is bordered on three sides by suburban single-family homes, and on one side by small farms and rural compounds. In 2012, Sage Creek High School was developed in the southwest corner of the preserve amid some controversy. Nature experts challenged the decision to construct the school on the preserve, but Carlsbad High School was reaching its capacity and there were few undeveloped areas that had sufficient space for an additional high school. Despite missing one of its original corners, the preserve still offers miles of hiking trails with ocean views.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/sdut-take-hike-lake-calavera-preserve-2012jan22-htmlstory.html|title=Take a Hike: Lake Calavera Preserve|last=Lister|first=Priscilla|date=January 22, 2012|website=The San Diego Union Tribune}}</ref>

{{wide image|Mount calavera panorama (cropped).jpg|1000px|Calavera Lake and Mount Calavera on the eastern boundary of Carlsbad}}

====Southeast quadrant====
The southeast quadrant (ZIP code 92009) is located east of El Camino Real and south of Palomar Airport Road and features several newer expensive [[master-planned community|master-planned communities]] set among hillsides, golf courses, Alga Norte Community Park and permanent open spaces. It includes Bressi Ranch and the La Costa neighborhoods of Rancho La Costa, La Costa Ridge, La Costa Oaks, La Costa Greens, La Costa Valley, and Rancho Carillo. In 1965, La Costa gave its name to the Gold Medal Golf Resort, La Costa Resort and Spa, now known as [[Omni La Costa Resort & Spa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.omnihotels.com/FindAHotel/SanDiegoLaCosta/OurHistory.aspx|title=Hotels In Carlsbad CA - History of Omni La Costa Resort & Spa|website=www.omnihotels.com}}</ref> Residents here are served by the [[Carlsbad Unified School District]], [[San Marcos Unified School District]] and the [[Encinitas Union School District]].

====Southwest quadrant====
This quadrant (ZIP code 92011) extends along the Pacific Ocean to the south of the center of Carlsbad. It includes the [[Aviara, Carlsbad, California|Aviara]] neighborhood, which is home to the [[Park Hyatt Resort Aviara|Park Hyatt Aviara Resort]]. It is located west of El Camino Real and south of Palomar Airport Road.

==Government==
=== Local government ===
In 2008, Carlsbad voters passed a measure to become a [[charter city]] (as opposed to the [[general-law municipality]] they had been before), approving the proposed charter by 82% and officially becoming such that same year.<ref>{{Cite web|title=City of Carlsbad - Charter City|url=https://www.carlsbadca.gov/cityhall/charter.asp|access-date=April 11, 2021|website=www.carlsbadca.gov}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=City of Carlsbad Adoption of a City Charter, Proposition D (June 2008)|url=https://ballotpedia.org/City_of_Carlsbad_Adoption_of_a_City_Charter,_Proposition_D_(June_2008)|access-date=April 11, 2021|website=Ballotpedia|language=en}}</ref>

Before the 2018 elections, city government was led by an elected mayor and four council members, elected at large; however, in July 2017, the city council voted to transition to district elections (except for the mayoral office, which remains an at-large position). Elections for Districts 1 and 3 were held in 2018, and in 2020, elections were held for the remaining Districts 2 and 4. As was the case before changing to district elections for the city council, city council members and the mayor are elected to 4-year terms.<ref>{{Cite web|date=October 31, 2017|title=What City Council District Elections Mean to Carlsbad|url=http://ncdailystar.com/what-city-council-district-elections-mean-to-carlsbad/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180331104420/http://ncdailystar.com/what-city-council-district-elections-mean-to-carlsbad/|archive-date=March 31, 2018|access-date=March 30, 2018}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=City of Carlsbad - District Elections|url=https://www.carlsbadca.gov/cityhall/clerk/district.asp|access-date=April 11, 2021|website=www.carlsbadca.gov}}</ref> See the official district map [https://www.carlsbadca.gov/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=34507 here] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105182631/https://www.carlsbadca.gov/civicax/filebank/blobdload.aspx?BlobID=34507 |date=November 5, 2017 }}(not to scale).

===Politics===
Carlsbad was a powerfully [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] stronghold during the 20th century, a classic bastion of suburban conservatism in Southern California. However, the GOP's edge in Carlsbad started to narrow in the 1990s and 2000s, with the city shifting Democratic. In 2008, [[Barack Obama]], then the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee for President, carried the city with a plurality. In 2012, [[Mitt Romney]], the GOP nominee, carried the city by a 9% margin. In 2016, the city flipped back to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], voting for Hillary Clinton by a 10.4% margin over [[Donald Trump]]. [[Joe Biden]] expanded that margin to 17.6% over Trump in 2020.
