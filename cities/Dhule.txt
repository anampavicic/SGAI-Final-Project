'''Dhule''' is a city located in the Dhule District in the northwestern part of Maharashtra state, India known as West Khandesh. Situated on the banks of Panzara River, Dhule is the regional headquarters of MIDC, RTO, and MTDC.

The city is mainly known for the Hindu temple of Adishakti Ekvira and [[Swaminarayan Temple]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2023|reason=Swaminarayan have huge temples around the world. What is special about this one?}}

The city, with industrial areas, schools, hospitals, and residential areas, has communications and transport infrastructures.  Dhule is largely emerging as one of the upcoming hubs of textile, edible oil, Information Technology, and power-loom across the state and has gained a strategic advantage for being on the junction of three National Highways viz. [[National Highway 3 (India, old numbering)|NH-3]], [[National Highway 6 (India, old numbering)|NH-6]], and [[National Highway 211 (India)(old numbering)|NH-211]] and on most anticipated Manmad – Indore Rail Project. Recently [[Ministry of Surface Transport]] has granted conversion of surrounding 4 state highways to National Highway, after which Dhule would be the one amongst very few cities in India being located on convergence of 7 National Highways. Conversion of [[National Highway 3 (India, old numbering)|NH-3]] from four lanes to six lanes between Dhule and [[Nashik]] with modern facilities is under process.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.loksatta.com/nashik-news/permission-for-dhule-nashik-highway-1268697/|title=धुळे-नाशिक महामार्गाच्या सहापदरीकरणास मान्यता|date=17 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://maharashtratimes.indiatimes.com/maharashtra/nashik-north-maharashtra-news/nashik/nashik-dhule-six-way-highway-project/articleshow/53243338.cms|title='नाशिक-धुळे' सहापदरी -Maharashtra Times|date=17 July 2016}}</ref>

==History==

Until the beginning of the 19th century, Dhule was an insignificant village, subordinate to Laling, the capital of the Laling or Fatehabad Subdivision. Under the rule of the Nizam, Laling was incorporated with the District of Daulatabad. The town passed successively through the hands of the Arab kings, the Mughals, and the Nizam, and into the power of the Peshwas about 1795. In 1803, it was completely deserted by its 
inhabitants on account of the ravages of Holkar and the terrible famine of that year. In the following year, Balaji Balwant, a dependant of the Vinchurkar, to whom the ''parganas'' of Laling and Songir had been granted by the Peshwa, repeopled the town and received from the Vinchurkar, in return for his services, a grant of ''inam'' land and other privileges. He was subsequently entrusted with the entire management of the territory of Songir and Laling, and fixed his headquarters at Dhule, where he continued to exercise authority till the occupation of the country by the British in 1818. Dhule was immediately chosen as the headquarters of the newly formed District of Khandesh by Captain John Briggs. In [[British Raj]] Britishers call it Dhulia.In January 1819, he obtained sanction for building public offices for the transaction of revenue and judicial business. Artificers were brought from distant places, and the buildings were erected at a total cost of £2700. Every encouragement was offered to traders and others to settle in the new town. Building sites were granted rent-free in perpetuity, and advances were made both to the old inhabitants and strangers to enable them to erect substantial houses. At this time, Captain Briggs described Dhule as a small town, surrounded by garden cultivation, and shut in between an irrigation channel and the river. The town was located on the southern bank of the [[Panzara River]] with an area of about one square mile. In 1819, the population numbered only 2509 persons, living in 401 houses. In 1863, there were 10,000 inhabitants; while by 1872 the number had further increased to 12,489, with 2620 houses. From the date of its occupation by the British, the progress of Dhule had been steady. Towards the end of the 19th century the town had already become a significant trading center due to the trade in cotton and linseed. Coarse cotton, woolen cloths and turbans were manufactured for local use around this time. In 1872, Dhule was visited by a severe flood, which did much damage to houses and property.<ref name="Hunter 1881 580">{{cite book |last=Hunter |first=William Wilson |url=https://archive.org/stream/imperialgazette02unkngoog#page/n5/mode/2up |title=The imperial gazetteer of India |publisher=Trubner and Company |year=1881 |location=London |page=580}}</ref><ref name="Trubner and Company">{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/imperialgazette02unkngoog |title=The imperial gazetteer of India [by] W.W.

The Dhulia aka Dhule civil hospital was established in 1825 by the British government.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Campbell |first=James M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbUBAAAAYAAJ |title=Gazetteer of Bombay presidency : Khandesh |publisher=British Government of India |year=1880 |location=[[Bombay presidency]], India |pages=1}}</ref>

Dhule was a cantonment town, and in year 1881 had two hospitals, telegraph and post offices. In 1873–74 there were four Government schools, with 551 pupils. Historically, the town has been divided into New and [[June Dhule|Old Dhule]]. In the latter, the houses were irregularly built, the majority being of a very humble description.<ref name="Hunter 1881 580" /><ref name="Trubner and Company" />

[[File:Central Bus Stand of Dhule.jpg|right|thumb|Dhule- Central Bus Stand]]

Dhule is one of the few cities in the Maharashtra State which is located on the junction of three National Highways, these being [[National Highway 3 (India, old numbering)|NH-3]], [[National Highway 6 (India, old numbering)|NH-6]] and [[National Highway 211 (India)(old numbering)|NH-211]]. Through the [[Asian highway]] project, portions of NH3 and NH6 passing through Dhule have been converted into numbered Asian Highways [[AH47]] & [[AH46]] respectively.

Due to the heavy use of Central Bus Stand and traffic congestion within the city, one more bus stand has been built in Deopur, which became fully operational from 23 March 2015. From this stand, about 120 route buses are running on a daily basis.<ref name="epaperdivyamarathi.bhaskar.com">[http://epaperdivyamarathi.bhaskar.com/jalgaon/dhule/259/24032015/0/1/ 03/24/2015 : Divya Marathi e-Paper, dhule, e-Paper, dhule e Paper, e Newspaper dhule, dhule e Paper, dhule ePaper].
