'''New Hampshire''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|æ|m|p|ʃ|ər}} {{respell|HAMP|shər}}) is a [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[New England]] region of the [[Northeastern United States]]. It borders [[Massachusetts]] to the south, [[Vermont]] to the west, [[Maine]] and the [[Gulf of Maine]] to the east, and the Canadian province of [[Quebec]] to the north. Of the [[List of states and territories of the United States|50 U.S. states]], New Hampshire is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|eighth-smallest]] by land area and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|tenth-least populous]], with a population of 1,377,529 residents as of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]]. [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] is the [[List of capitals in the United States|state capital]] and [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] is the [[List of municipalities in New Hampshire|most populous city]]. New Hampshire's [[List of U.S. state mottos|motto]], "[[Live Free or Die]]", reflects its role in the [[American Revolutionary War]]; its [[state nickname|nickname]], "The [[Granite]] State", refers to its extensive granite formations and [[quarries]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Visit NH: State Facts |publisher=NH Department of Resources and Economic Development |access-date=August 30, 2010 |url=http://www.visitnh.gov/welcome-to-nh/state-facts.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014112959/http://www.visitnh.gov/welcome-to-nh/state-facts.aspx |archive-date=October 14, 2010 }}</ref> It is well known nationwide for holding [[New Hampshire primary|the first primary]] (after the [[Iowa caucus]]) in the [[United States presidential election|U.S. presidential election cycle]], and for its resulting influence on American electoral politics.

New Hampshire was inhabited for thousands of years by [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-speaking peoples such as the [[Abenaki]]. Europeans arrived in the early 17th century, with the English establishing some of the earliest non-indigenous settlements. The [[Province of New Hampshire]] was established in 1629, named after the [[England|English]] [[Counties of England|county]] of [[Hampshire]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Origin of "New Hampshire"|date=September 28, 2014 |url=http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/new-hampshire/state-name-origin/origin-new-hampshire|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904004447/http://www.statesymbolsusa.org/symbol-official-item/new-hampshire/state-name-origin/origin-new-hampshire|archive-date=September 4, 2015|access-date=August 30, 2015|publisher=State Symbols USA}}</ref> Following mounting tensions between [[Thirteen Colonies|the British colonies]] and the crown during the 1760s, New Hampshire saw one of the earliest overt acts of rebellion, with the seizing of [[Fort William and Mary]] from the British in 1774. In January 1776, it became the first of the British North American [[European colonization of the Americas|colonies]] to establish an independent government and state constitution; six months later, it signed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] and [[History of New Hampshire#Revolution: 1774–1815|contributed troops, ships, and supplies]] in the war against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]]. In June 1788, it was the ninth state to ratify the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]], bringing that document into effect. Through the mid-19th century, New Hampshire was an active center of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], and fielded close to 32,000 [[Union Army|Union soldiers]] during the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]]. After the war, the state saw rapid industrialization and population growth, becoming a center of [[textile manufacturing]], [[shoemaking]], and [[papermaking]]; the [[Amoskeag Manufacturing Company]] in Manchester was at one time the largest cotton textile plant in the world. The [[Merrimack River|Merrimack]] and [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]] rivers were lined with industrial mills, most of which employed workers from Canada and Europe; [[French Canadian]]s formed the most significant influx of immigrants, and today roughly a quarter of all New Hampshire residents have [[French Americans|French American]] ancestry, second only to Maine.

Reflecting a nationwide trend, New Hampshire's industrial sector declined after [[World War II]]. Since 1950, its economy diversified to include financial and professional services, real estate, education, transportation and high-tech, with manufacturing still higher than the national average.<ref>{{Cite news|date=August 21, 2019|title=Economy by Industry in N.H. and U.S.|url=https://carsey.unh.edu/what-is-new-hampshire/economy/table-industry-share|access-date=July 20, 2021|newspaper=Carsey School of Public Policy &#124; UNH|language=en}}</ref> Beginning in the 1950s, its population surged as major highways connected it to [[Greater Boston]] and led to more [[bedroom communities|commuter towns]].

With its mountainous and heavily forested terrain, New Hampshire has a growing tourism sector centered on outdoor recreation. It has some of the [[List of New England ski areas by vertical drop|highest ski mountains on the East Coast]] and is a major destination for winter sports; [[Mount Monadnock]] is among the most climbed mountains in the United States. Other activities include [[leaf peeping|observing the fall foliage]], summer cottages along many lakes and the seacoast, motorsports at the [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway]] in [[Loudon, New Hampshire|Loudon]], and [[Laconia Motorcycle Week|Motorcycle Week]], a popular motorcycle rally held in [[Weirs Beach, New Hampshire|Weirs Beach]] in [[Laconia, New Hampshire|Laconia]].

English and French explorers visited New Hampshire in 1600–1605, and [[David Thompson (New Hampshire settler)|David Thompson]] settled at [[Odiorne Point State Park|Odiorne's Point]] in present-day [[Rye, New Hampshire|Rye]] in 1623. The first permanent European settlement was at Hilton's Point (present-day [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]]). By 1631, the Upper Plantation comprised modern-day Dover, [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]] and [[Stratham, New Hampshire|Stratham]]; in 1679, it became the "[[Province of New Hampshire|Royal Province]]". [[Father Rale's War]] was fought between the colonists and the [[Wabanaki Confederacy]] throughout New Hampshire.

New Hampshire was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that rebelled against British rule during the [[American Revolution]]. During the American Revolution, New Hampshire was economically divided. The Seacoast region revolved around sawmills, shipyards, merchants' warehouses, and established village and town centers, where wealthy merchants built substantial homes, furnished them with luxuries, and invested their capital in trade and land speculation. At the other end of the social scale, there developed a permanent class of day laborers, mariners, indentured servants and slaves.

The following day, [[John Sullivan (general)|John Sullivan]] raided the fort for weapons. During the raid, the British soldiers fired at rebels with cannon and muskets, but there were apparently no casualties. These were among the first shots in the American Revolutionary period, occurring approximately five months before the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord]]. On January 5, 1776, New Hampshire became the first colony to declare independence from Great Britain, almost six months before the Declaration of Independence was signed by the Continental Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/nh09.asp|title=Constitution of New Hampshire - 1776|date=December 18, 1998 }}</ref>

The [[United States Constitution]] was ratified by New Hampshire on June 21, 1788, when New Hampshire became the ninth state to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/constitution-day/ratification.html|title=Observing Constitution Day|website=Archives.gov|access-date=April 7, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190817165833/https://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/constitution-day/ratification.html|archive-date=August 17, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

New Hampshire was a Jacksonian stronghold; the state sent [[Franklin Pierce]] to the White House in the election of 1852. Industrialization took the form of numerous textile mills, which in turn attracted large flows of [[immigrants]] from Quebec (the "French Canadians") and [[Ireland]]. The northern parts of the state produced lumber, and the mountains provided tourist attractions. After 1960, the textile industry collapsed, but the economy rebounded as a center of high technology and as a service provider.

Starting in 1952, New Hampshire gained national and international attention for its [[New Hampshire primary|presidential primary]] held early in every presidential election year. It immediately became an important testing ground for candidates for the Republican and Democratic nominations but did not necessarily guarantee victory.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-12-19 |title=The First Primary: Why New Hampshire? |url=https://carsey.unh.edu/publication/first-primary-why-new-hampshire |access-date=2024-06-06 |website=Carsey School of Public Policy |language=en}}</ref> The media gave New Hampshire and [[Iowa]] significant attention compared to other states in the primary process, magnifying the state's decision powers and spurring repeated efforts by out-of-state politicians to change the rules.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Why is New Hampshire the first primary in the nation? |url=https://www.brookings.edu/articles/why-is-new-hampshire-the-first-primary-in-the-nation/ |access-date=2024-06-06 |website=Brookings |language=en-US}}</ref>

In southwestern New Hampshire, the landmark [[Mount Monadnock]] has given its name to a class of earth-forms—a ''[[monadnock]]''—signifying, in geomorphology, any isolated resistant peak rising from a less resistant eroded plain.

New Hampshire has more than 800 lakes and ponds, and approximately {{convert|19000|mi}} of rivers and streams.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rivers and Lakes |url=https://www.des.nh.gov/water/rivers-and-lakes |access-date=June 5, 2023 |website=NH Department of Environmental Services |language=en}}</ref> Major rivers include the {{convert|110|mi|km|adj=on|sigfig=3}} [[Merrimack River]], which bisects the lower half of the state north–south before passing into Massachusetts and reaching the sea in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts|Newburyport]]. Its tributaries include the [[Contoocook River]], [[Pemigewasset River]], and [[Winnipesaukee River]]. The {{convert|410|mi|km|adj=on|sigfig=3}} [[Connecticut River]], which starts at New Hampshire's [[Connecticut Lakes]] and flows south to [[Connecticut]], defines the western border with Vermont. The state border is not in the center of that river, as is usually the case, but at the low-water mark on the Vermont side; meaning the entire river along the Vermont border (save for areas where the water level has been raised by a dam) lies within New Hampshire.<ref>''Vermont v. New Hampshire'' {{Ussc|289|593|1933}}</ref> Only one town—[[Pittsburg, New Hampshire|Pittsburg]]—shares a land border with the state of Vermont. The "northwesternmost headwaters" of the Connecticut also define part of the Canada–U.S. border.

The [[Piscataqua River]] and its several [[tributary|tributaries]] form the state's only significant ocean port where they flow into the Atlantic at [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. The [[Salmon Falls River]] and the Piscataqua define the southern portion of the border with Maine. The Piscataqua River boundary was the subject of a [[Piscataqua River border dispute|border dispute]] between New Hampshire and Maine in 2001, with New Hampshire claiming dominion over several islands (primarily [[Seavey's Island]]) that include the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]]. The [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] dismissed the case in 2002, leaving ownership of the island with Maine. New Hampshire still claims sovereignty of the base, however.<ref>{{cite web |title = HJR 1—Final Version |url = http://gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2006/hjr0001.html |publisher = [[New Hampshire General Court]] |access-date = September 22, 2015 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151016014356/http://gencourt.state.nh.us/legislation/2006/hjr0001.html |archive-date = October 16, 2015 |url-status = live }}</ref>

The northern third of the state is locally referred to as the "north country" or "north of the notches", in reference to the White Mountain [[mountain pass|passes]] that channel traffic. It contains less than 5% of the state's population, suffers relatively high poverty, and is steadily losing population as the logging and paper industries decline. However, the tourist industry, in particular visitors who go to northern New Hampshire to [[skiing|ski]], [[snowboarding|snowboard]], [[hiking|hike]] and [[mountain biking|mountain bike]], has helped offset economic losses from mill closures.

Environmental protection emerged as a key state issue in the early 1900s in response to poor logging practices. In the 1970s, activists defeated a proposal to build an oil refinery along the coast and limited plans for a full-width interstate highway through [[Franconia Notch]] to a parkway.<ref>Kimberly A.

===Climate===
New Hampshire experiences a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'' in some southern areas, ''Dfb'' in most of the state, and ''Dfc'' subarctic in some northern highland areas), with warm, humid summers, and long, cold, and snowy winters. Precipitation is fairly evenly distributed all year. The climate of the southeastern portion is moderated by the [[Atlantic Ocean]] and averages relatively milder winters (for New Hampshire), while the northern and interior portions experience colder temperatures and lower humidity. Winters are cold and snowy throughout the state, and especially severe in the northern and mountainous areas. Average annual snowfall ranges from {{convert|60|in|cm}} to over {{convert|100|in|cm}} across the state.<ref name="noaasnow">{{cite web| url=http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/snowfall.html |title=Snowfall—Average Total in Inches |publisher=[[NOAA]] |date=June 23, 2004 |first=Dan |last=Dellinger |access-date=May 25, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110619061102/http://www.governor.nh.gov/media/news/2011/061511-hb218.htm |archive-date=June 19, 2011 }}</ref>

Average daytime highs are in the mid 70s°F to low 80s°F (24–28&nbsp;°C) throughout the state in July, with overnight lows in the mid 50s°F to low 60s°F (13–15&nbsp;°C). January temperatures range from an average high of {{convert|34|F|C}} on the coast to overnight lows below {{convert|0|F|C}} in the far north and at high elevations. Average annual precipitation statewide is roughly {{convert|40|in|cm}} with some variation occurring in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]] due to differences in elevation and annual snowfall. New Hampshire's highest recorded temperature was {{convert|106|F|C}} in [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]] on July 4, 1911, while the lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|-47|F|C}} atop [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] on January 29, 1934. Mount Washington also saw an unofficial {{convert|-50|F|C}} reading on January 22, 1885, which, if made official, would tie the record low for New England (also {{convert|-50|F|C}} at [[Big Black River (Saint John River)|Big Black River]], Maine, on January 16, 2009, and [[Bloomfield, Vermont]] on December 30, 1933).

Extreme snow is often associated with a [[nor'easter]], such as the [[Northeastern United States blizzard of 1978|Blizzard of '78]] and the [[Blizzard of 1993]], when several feet accumulated across portions of the state over 24 to 48 hours. Lighter snowfalls of several inches occur frequently throughout winter, often associated with an [[Alberta Clipper]].

New Hampshire, on occasion, is affected by [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] and tropical storms—although, by the time they reach the state, they are often [[extratropical]]—with most storms striking the southern New England coastline and moving inland or passing by offshore in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. Most of New Hampshire averages fewer than 20 days of thunderstorms per year and an average of two tornadoes occur annually statewide.<ref name="noaatornado">{{cite web |title=Annual average number of tornadoes 1953–2004 |url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |publisher=NOAA |access-date=May 25, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |archive-date=October 16, 2011 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Population===
[[File:Ethnic Origins in New Hampshire.png|thumb|270x270px|Ethnic origins in New Hampshire]]

As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the resident population of New Hampshire was 1,377,529,<ref name="Census residential population"/> a 4.6% increase since the [[2010 United States Census]]. The [[center of population]] of New Hampshire is in [[Merrimack County, New Hampshire|Merrimack County]], in the town of [[Pembroke, New Hampshire|Pembroke]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/centers-population.html |title=Centers of Population: 2020 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |access-date=January 3, 2022}}</ref> The center of population has moved south {{convert|12|mi}} since 1950,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.nh.gov/oep/programs/DataCenter/Geography/documents/popcenter.pdf |title=Population Center of New Hampshire, 1950–2000 |date=October 2007 |publisher=NH Office of Energy and Planning |access-date=September 10, 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080724022314/http://www.nh.gov/oep/programs/DataCenter/Geography/documents/popcenter.pdf |archive-date=July 24, 2008 }}</ref> a reflection of the fact that the state's fastest growth has been along its southern border, which is within commuting range of Boston and other Massachusetts cities.

As indicated in the census, in 2020 88.3% of the population were [[White Americans|White]]; 1.5% were [[African Americans|Black or African American]]; 0.2% were [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] or Alaskan Native; 2.6% were [[Asian Americans|Asian]]; 0.0% were [[Native Hawaiian]] or other [[Pacific Islander]]; 1.7% were some other race; and 5.6% were [[multiracial Americans|two or more races]]. 4.3% of the total population were [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic or Latino]] of any race. 18.6% of the population were under 18 years of age; 19.3% were 65 years and over. The female population was 50.5%.<ref name="2020DP1"/>

The most densely populated areas generally lie within {{convert|50|mi|0}} of the Massachusetts border, and are concentrated in two areas: along the [[Merrimack River Valley]] running from [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] to [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], and in the [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|Seacoast Region]] along an axis stretching from [[Rochester, New Hampshire|Rochester]] to [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]. Outside of those two regions, only one community, the city of [[Keene, New Hampshire|Keene]], has a population of over 20,000. The four counties covering these two areas account for 72% of the state population, and one ([[Hillsborough County, New Hampshire|Hillsborough]]) has nearly 30% of the state population, as well as the two most populous communities, Manchester and Nashua. The northern portion of the state is very sparsely populated: the largest county by area, [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos]], covers the northern one-fourth of the state and has only around 31,000 people, about a third of whom live in a single community ([[Berlin, New Hampshire|Berlin]]). The trends over the past several decades have been for the population to shift southward, as many northern communities lack the economic base to maintain their populations, while southern communities have been absorbed by the [[Greater Boston]] metropolis.

New Hampshire experienced a major shift in its economic base during the 20th century. Historically, the base was composed of traditional New England textiles, shoemaking, and small machine shops, drawing upon low-wage labor from nearby small farms and parts of Quebec. Today, of the state's total manufacturing dollar value, these sectors contribute only two percent for textiles, two percent for leather goods, and nine percent for machining.<ref>U.S. Economic Census for 1997, Manufacturing, New Hampshire</ref> They experienced a sharp decline due to obsolete plants and the lure of cheaper wages in the [[Southern United States]].

New Hampshire today has a broad-based and growing economy, with a state GDP growth rate of 2.2% in 2018.<ref name=":0" /> The state's largest economic sectors in 2018, based on contribution to GDP, are: 15% real estate and rental and leasing; 13% [[professional services|professional business services]]; 12% manufacturing; 10% government and government services; and 9% health care and social services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://apps.bea.gov/itable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=70&step=1#reqid=70&step=1&isuri=1|title=Bureau of Economic Analysis—Gross Domestic Product by State|date=May 1, 2019|access-date=June 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181023080037/https://apps.bea.gov/itable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=70&step=1#reqid=70&step=1&isuri=1|archive-date=October 23, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The state's [[budget]] in FY2018 was $5.97{{spaces}}billion, including $1.79{{spaces}}billion in federal funds.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/LBA/budget/operating_budgets/2018_2019/Final/HB%20144%20Adopted%206-22-17.pdf |title=FY 2017 and FY2018 Budget |date=June 22, 2017|website=New Hampshire General Court|access-date=June 13, 2019}}</ref> The issue of taxation is controversial in New Hampshire, which has a [[property tax]] (subject to municipal control) but no broad [[sales tax]] or income tax. The state does have narrower taxes on meals, lodging, vehicles, business and investment income, and tolls on state roads.

According to the [[Energy Information Administration]], New Hampshire's energy consumption and per capita energy consumption are among the lowest in the country. The [[Seabrook Station Nuclear Power Plant]], near Portsmouth, is the largest individual electrical generating unit on the New England power grid and provided 57% of New Hampshire's electricity generation in 2017. Power generation from wind power increased strongly in 2012 and 2013, but remained rather flat for the next ten years at around 4% of consumption. In 2016, 2017 and at least 2019–2022, New Hampshire obtained more of its electricity generation from wind power than from coal-fired power plants. [[Hydroelectricity|Hydroelectric]] power and [[biomass]] are other important [[Renewable energy in the United States|renewable resources]] in the state.

New Hampshire's residential electricity use is low compared with the national average, in part because demand for air conditioning is low during the generally mild summer months and because few households use electricity as their primary energy source for home heating. Nearly half of New Hampshire households use [[fuel oil]] for winter heating, which is one of the largest shares in the United States. New Hampshire has potential for renewable energies like wind power, hydroelectricity, and [[wood fuel]].<ref name=":2" />

The state has no general sales tax and no personal [[state income tax]] (the state currently does tax, at a five percent rate, income from dividends and interest, but this tax is set to expire in 2027.<ref name="What Effect Will Eliminating N.H.'s Tax on Interest and Dividend Income Actually Have? – NHPR – Josh Rogers, Ed Brouder, and Julia Furukawa reporting">{{cite web |last1=Rogers |first1=Josh |last2=Brouder |first2=Ed |last3=Furukawa |first3=Julia |title=What Effect Will Eliminating N.H.'s Tax on Interest and Dividend Income Actually Have? |url=https://www.nhpr.org/nh-news/2021-08-02/nh-tax-dividend-income-state-budget |website=www.nhpr.org |date=August 2, 2021 |publisher=New Hampshire Public Radio |access-date=February 2, 2022}}</ref>)

The (preliminary) seasonally [[Unemployment|unemployment rate]] in April 2019 was 2.4% based on a 767,500 person civilian workforce with 749,000 people in employment. New Hampshire's workforce is 90% in nonfarm employment, with 18% employed in trade, transportation, and utilities; 17% in education and health care; 12% in government; 11% in professional and business services; and 10% in leisure and hospitality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.nh.htm|title=New Hampshire Economy at a Glance|website=www.bls.gov|access-date=June 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190418230711/https://www.bls.gov/eag/eag.nh.htm|archive-date=April 18, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Largest employers===
In March 2018, 86% of New Hampshire's workforce were employed by the private sector, with 53% of those workers being employed by firms with fewer than 100 employees. About 14% of private-sector employees are employed by firms with more than 1,000 employees.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhes.nh.gov/elmi/statistics/fbs.htm|title=Firms by Size {{!}} Data & Statistics {{!}} Data and Analysis {{!}} Economic & Labor Market Information Bureau (ELMI) {{!}} NH Employment Security|website=www.nhes.nh.gov|access-date=June 18, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503001530/http://www.nhes.nh.gov/elmi/statistics/fbs.htm|archive-date=May 3, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Law and government==
{{Main|Government of New Hampshire}}
[[File:Concord New Hampshire state house 20041229.jpg|thumb|The [[New Hampshire State House]] in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]]]

The governor of New Hampshire, since January 5, 2017, is Republican [[Chris Sununu]]. New Hampshire's two U.S. senators are [[Jeanne Shaheen]] and [[Maggie Hassan]], both of whom are Democrats and former governors. New Hampshire's two U.S. representatives as of January 2019 are [[Chris Pappas (American politician)|Chris Pappas]] and [[Ann McLane Kuster]], both Democrats.

New Hampshire is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]], and through the [[New Hampshire Liquor Commission|State Liquor Commission]] takes in $100{{spaces}}million from the sale and distribution of liquor.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://admin.state.nh.us/accounting/FY%2005/Monthly%20Rev%20June-05%20Cash%20Basis%20Unaud.pdf |title=State of New Hampshire Monthly Revenue Focus (FY 2005) |publisher=NH Department of Administrative Services |access-date=February 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811040853/http://admin.state.nh.us/accounting/FY%2005/Monthly%20Rev%20June-05%20Cash%20Basis%20Unaud.pdf |archive-date=August 11, 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

New Hampshire is the only state in the U.S. that does not require adults to wear seat belts in their vehicles. It is one of three states that have no mandatory helmet law.

===Governing documents===
{{Main|Law of New Hampshire}}

The [[New Hampshire State Constitution]] of 1783 is the supreme law of the state, followed by the [[New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated]] and the [[New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules]]. These are roughly analogous to the federal [[United States Constitution]], [[United States Code]] and [[Code of Federal Regulations]] respectively.

===Branches of government===
New Hampshire has a bifurcated executive branch, consisting of the governor and a five-member [[Executive Council of New Hampshire|executive council]] which votes on state contracts worth more than $5,000 and "advises and consents" to the governor's nominations to major state positions such as department heads and all judgeships and [[pardon]] requests. New Hampshire does not have a [[lieutenant governor (United States)#New Hampshire|lieutenant governor]]; the Senate president serves as "acting governor" whenever the governor is unable to perform the duties.

The legislature is called the [[New Hampshire General Court|General Court]]. It consists of the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and the [[New Hampshire Senate|Senate]]. There are 400 representatives, making it one of the largest elected bodies in the English-speaking world,<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/memberlookup.aspx |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070815211306/http://gencourt.state.nh.us/house/members/memberlookup.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-date=August 15, 2007 |title="House Fast Fact", New Hampshire House of Representatives |publisher=New Hampshire General Court |website=Gencourt.state.nh.us |access-date=July 31, 2010 }}</ref> and 24 senators. Legislators are paid a nominal salary of $200 per two-year term plus travel costs, the lowest in the U.S. by far. Thus most are effectively volunteers, nearly half of whom are [[retirement|retirees]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Cunningham |first1=Geoff |title=Why run for N.H. Legislature? It's not for $100, fame or a license plate |url=https://www.fosters.com/article/20100822/GJNEWS_01/708229882 |website=fosters.com |publisher=Foster's Daily Democrat |access-date=April 12, 2021}}</ref> (For details, see the article on [[Government of New Hampshire#Legislative Branch|Government of New Hampshire]].)

The state's sole appellate court is the [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]]. The [[New Hampshire Superior Court|Superior Court]] is the court of general jurisdiction and the only court which provides for jury trials in [[civil law (common law)|civil]] or [[criminal law|criminal]] cases. The other state courts are the [[New Hampshire Probate Court|Probate Court]], [[New Hampshire District Court|District Court]], and the [[New Hampshire Family Division|Family Division]].

===Local government===
New Hampshire has [[List of counties in New Hampshire|10 counties]] and [[List of cities and towns in New Hampshire|234 cities and towns]].

New Hampshire is a [[John Forrest Dillon|"Dillon Rule"]] state, meaning the state retains all powers not specifically granted to municipalities. Even so, the legislature strongly favors local control, particularly concerning land use regulations. New Hampshire municipalities are classified as [[New England town|towns]] or cities, which differ primarily by the form of government. Most towns generally operate on the [[town meeting]] form of government, where the registered voters in the town act as the town legislature, and a [[board of selectmen]] acts as the executive of the town. Larger towns and the state's thirteen cities operate either on a [[Council–manager government|council–manager]] or [[Mayor–council government|council–mayor]] form of government. There is no difference, from the state government's point of view, between towns and cities besides the form of government. All state-level statutes treat all municipalities identically.

New Hampshire has a small number of [[unincorporated area]]s that are titled as grants, locations, purchases, or townships. These locations have limited to no self-government, and services are generally provided for them by neighboring towns or the county or state where needed. As of the 2000 census, there were 25 of these left in New Hampshire, accounting for a total population of 173 people ({{as of|2000|lc=y}}); several were entirely depopulated. All but two of these unincorporated areas are in [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos County]].

===Politics===
{{Main|Politics of New Hampshire}}

New Hampshire is known for its [[fiscal conservatism]] and [[cultural liberalism]]. The state's politics are cited as [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] leaning.<ref name=":5" /> It is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by religiosity|least religious state]] in the Union as of a 2016 Gallup poll.<ref name=LeastGallup /> The state has long had a great disdain for state taxation and state [[bureaucracy]].<ref>Frank L.

The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], in that order, are the two largest parties in the state.

As of August 30, 2022, there were 869,863 registered voters, of whom 332,008 (38.17%) did not declare a political party affiliation, 273,921 (31.49%) were Democratic, and 263,934 (30.34%) were Republican.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sos.nh.gov/elections/voters/voting-new-hampshire/party-registrationnames-checklist-history |title=Voting in New Hampshire |publisher=NH Secretary of State |date=August 30, 2022 |access-date=March 3, 2023 }}</ref>

====New Hampshire primary====
[[File:Alumni Hall 1889 Sun.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Anselm College]] has held several national debates on campus.]]

New Hampshire is internationally known for the [[New Hampshire primary]], the first [[U.S. presidential primary|primary]] in the quadrennial American presidential election cycle. State law requires that the Secretary of State schedule this election at least one week before any "similar event". While the [[Iowa caucus]] precedes the New Hampshire primary, the New Hampshire election is the nation's first contest that uses the same procedure as the general election, draws more attention than those in other states, and has been decisive in shaping the national contest.

In February 2023, the Democratic National Committee awarded that party's first primary to [[South Carolina]], to be held on February 3, 2024, directing New Hampshire and Nevada to vote three days later.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/news/2023/02/04/dnc-presidential-primary-calendar-00081206|title=DNC votes to shake up presidential primary calendar|website=POLITICO|date=February 4, 2023 }}</ref> New Hampshire political leaders from both parties have vowed to stand by the state's "first in the nation" law and ignore the DNC.

State law permits a town with fewer than 100 residents to open its polls at midnight and close when all registered citizens have cast their ballots. As such, the communities of [[Dixville Notch, New Hampshire|Dixville Notch]] in [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos County]] and [[Hart's Location, New Hampshire|Hart's Location]] in [[Carroll County, New Hampshire|Carroll County]], among others, have chosen to implement these provisions. Dixville Notch and Hart's Location are traditionally the first places in both New Hampshire and the U.S. to vote in presidential primaries and elections.

Nominations for all other partisan offices are decided in a separate [[Partisan primary|primary election]]. In Presidential election cycles, this is the second primary election held in New Hampshire.

[[Saint Anselm College]] in [[Goffstown, New Hampshire|Goffstown]] has become a popular campaign spot for politicians as well as several national presidential debates because of its proximity to [[Manchester-Boston Regional Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.saintanselmcollege.net/category/politics/face-the-nation/|title=CBS's Face the Nation : Saint Anselm College|date=November 13, 2008|access-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113151947/http://blogs.saintanselmcollege.net/category/politics/face-the-nation/|archive-date=November 13, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anselm.edu/news+and+events/college+news/news/2007-11-29-primarydebates.htm|title=Saint Anselm College—Saint Anselm to Host ABC Debates in Dana Center|date=May 11, 2008|access-date=September 4, 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511173202/http://www.anselm.edu/news+and+events/college+news/news/2007-11-29-primarydebates.htm|archive-date=May 11, 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=William Schpero |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/candidates-face-off-at-st-anselms-college/ |title=Candidates Face Off at St. Anselm's College |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=January 7, 2008 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101061337/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/01/07/politics/uwire/main3684304.shtml |archive-date=November 1, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Elections====
{{Main|Elections in New Hampshire}}
{{Further|United States presidential elections in New Hampshire}}
[[File:Dartmouth College campus - Democratic Presidential Candidates Debate 51.jpg|thumb|Dartmouth College before a debate in 2008]]

In the past, New Hampshire has often voted Republican. Between 1856 and 1988, New Hampshire cast its electoral votes for the Democratic presidential ticket six times: [[Woodrow Wilson]] (twice), [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] (three times), and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (once).

Beginning in 1992, New Hampshire became a [[swing state]] in national and local elections, and in that time has supported Democrats in all presidential elections except 2000. It was the only state in the country to switch from supporting Republican [[George W. Bush]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 election]] to supporting his Democratic challenger in the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 election]], when [[John Kerry]], a senator from neighboring Massachusetts, won the state.

The Democrats dominated elections in New Hampshire in 2006 and 2008. In 2006, Democrats won both congressional seats (electing [[Carol Shea-Porter]] in the first district and [[Paul Hodes]] in the second), re-elected Governor [[John Lynch (New Hampshire governor)|John Lynch]], and gained a majority on the Executive Council and in both houses for the first time since 1911. Democrats had not held both the legislature and the governorship since 1874.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/masshightech/stories/2006/12/25/focus2.html |title=Storm of change sweeps through N.H.

In 2008, Democrats retained their majorities, governorship, and Congressional seats; and former governor [[Jeanne Shaheen]] defeated incumbent Republican [[John E. Sununu]] for the U.S. Senate in a rematch of the 2002 contest.

The 2008 elections resulted in women holding a majority, 13 of the 24 seats, in the New Hampshire Senate, a first for any legislative body in the United States.<ref>Senate President Sylvia Larsen, quoted in "Women make up majority in state Senate," ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader]]'', November 6, 2008.</ref>

In the 2010 midterm elections, Republicans made historic gains in New Hampshire, capturing veto-proof majorities in the state legislature, taking all five seats in the Executive Council, electing a new U.S. senator, [[Kelly Ayotte]], winning both U.S. House seats, and reducing the margin of victory of incumbent Governor [[John Lynch (New Hampshire governor)|John Lynch]] compared to his 2006 and 2008 landslide wins.

In the 2012 state legislative elections, Democrats took back the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]] and narrowed the Republican majority in the [[New Hampshire Senate]] to 13–11.<ref>{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Sullivan |title=New Hampshire's Democratic wave, explained |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/11/09/new-hampshires-democratic-wave-explained/ |location=Washington, DC |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 9, 2012 |access-date=September 2, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514011248/http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/11/09/new-hampshires-democratic-wave-explained/ |archive-date=May 14, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2012, New Hampshire became the first state in U.S. history to elect an all-female federal delegation: Democratic Congresswomen [[Carol Shea-Porter]] of [[New Hampshire's 1st congressional district|Congressional District 1]] and [[Ann McLane Kuster]] of [[New Hampshire's 2nd congressional district|Congressional District 2]] accompanied U.S. Senators [[Jeanne Shaheen]] and [[Kelly Ayotte]] in 2013. Further, the state elected its second female governor: Democrat [[Maggie Hassan]].

In the 2014 elections, Republicans retook the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]] with a 239–160 majority and expanded their majority in the [[New Hampshire Senate]] to 14 of the Senate's 24 seats. On the national level, incumbent Democratic Senator [[Jeanne Shaheen]] defeated her Republican challenger, former Massachusetts senator [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]]. New Hampshire also elected [[Frank Guinta]] (R) for its First Congressional District representative and [[Ann Kuster]] (D) for its Second Congressional District representative.

In the 2016 elections, Republicans held the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]] with a majority of 220–175 and held onto their 14 seats in the [[New Hampshire Senate]]. In the gubernatorial race, retiring Governor [[Maggie Hassan]] was succeeded by Republican [[Chris Sununu]], who defeated Democratic nominee [[Colin Van Ostern]]. Sununu became the state's first Republican governor since [[Craig Benson]], who left office in 2005 following defeat by [[John Lynch (New Hampshire governor)|John Lynch]]. Republicans control the governor's office and both chambers of the state legislature, a governing trifecta in which the Republicans have full governing power.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/11/us/elections/state-legislature-change-in-control.html|title=In a Further Blow to Democrats, Republicans Increase Their Hold on State Governments|first1=K. k Rebecca Lai, Jasmine C.|last1=Lee|first2=Karl|last2=Russell|date=November 11, 2016|website=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=September 4, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170827162124/https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/11/11/us/elections/state-legislature-change-in-control.html|archive-date=August 27, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> In the presidential race, the state voted for the Democratic nominee, former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]] over the Republican nominee, Donald Trump, by a margin of 2,736 votes, or 0.3%, one of the closest results the state has ever seen in a presidential race, while Libertarian nominee [[Gary Johnson]] received 4.12% of the vote. The Democrats also won a competitive race in the Second Congressional District, as well as a competitive senate race. Since 2017, New Hampshire's congressional delegation has consisted of exclusively Democrats. In the [[116th United States Congress]], it was one of seven states with an entirely Democratic delegation.

====Free State Project====
The [[Free State Project]] (FSP) is a movement founded in 2001 to recruit at least 20,000 libertarians to move to a single low-population state (New Hampshire, was selected in 2003), to concentrate [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] activism around a single region.<ref>{{cite news|title=Libertarians Pursue New Political Goal: State of Their Own|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/27/us/libertarians-pursue-new-political-goal-state-of-their-own.html?pagewanted=all|first=Pam|last=Belluck|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 27, 2003|access-date=February 2, 2022}}</ref> The Free State Project emphasizes decentralized decision-making, encouraging new movers and prior residents of New Hampshire to participate in a way the individual mover deems most appropriate. For example, as of 2017, there were 17 so-called Free Staters elected to the New Hampshire House of Representatives,<ref>{{cite web |title=Media Memo: Free State Project Members Make Up Disproportionate Percentage of NH Freedom Caucus |url=https://granitestateprogress.org/2017/04/24/media-memo-free-state-project-members-make-up-disproportionate-percentage-of-nh-freedom-caucus/ |date=April 24, 2017}}</ref> and in 2021, the [[New Hampshire Liberty Alliance]], which ranks bills and elected representatives based on their adherence to what they see as libertarian principles, scored 150 representatives as "A−" or above rated representatives.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Hampshire 2021 Liberty Ranking |url=https://nhliberty.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/2021_Liberty_Rating.pdf |access-date=February 2, 2022}}</ref> Participants also engage with other like-minded activist groups such as Rebuild New Hampshire,<ref>{{cite web|title=My Turn: Sununu must stop enabling white nationalism, anti-government extremism|url=https://www.concordmonitor.com/Sununu-and-the-far-right-38171252|date=January 10, 2021|access-date=February 2, 2022|archive-date=February 2, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220202135302/https://www.concordmonitor.com/Sununu-and-the-far-right-38171252|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Young Americans for Liberty]],<ref>{{cite press release |title=Young Americans for Liberty Celebrates Victory for Right to Work in New Hampshire!|url=https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/young-americans-for-liberty-celebrates-victory-for-right-to-work-in-new-hampshire-301235070.html |date=February 24, 2021}}</ref> and [[Americans for Prosperity]].<ref>{{cite web |title=NH Primary Source: Americans for Prosperity-NH endorses Sununu, Wheeler, 6 House candidates|url=https://www.wmur.com/article/nh-primary-source-americans-for-prosperity-endorses-sununu-wheeler-6-house-candidates/33470334# |date=July 30, 2020}}</ref>  As of April 2022, approximately 6,232 participants have moved to New Hampshire for the Free State Project.<ref>{{cite web |title=FSP current mover count |url=https://www.fsp.org/ |website=fsp.org |publisher=Free State Project |access-date=April 29, 2022}}</ref>

==Transportation==
===Highways===
{{Main|New Hampshire Highway System}}

New Hampshire has a well-maintained, well-signed network of [[Interstate highways]], U.S. highways, and state highways. State highway markers still depict the [[Old Man of the Mountain]] despite that rock formation's demise in 2003. Several route numbers align with the same route numbers in neighboring states. State highway numbering is arbitrary, with no overall system as with U.S. and Interstate systems. Major routes include:
* [[File:I-89.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 89]] runs northwest from near [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]] to [[Lebanon, New Hampshire|Lebanon]] on the [[Vermont]] border.
* [[File:I-93.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 93]] is the main Interstate highway in New Hampshire and runs north from [[Salem, New Hampshire|Salem]] (on the Massachusetts border) to [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]] (on the Vermont border). I-93 connects the more densely populated southern part of the state to the Lakes Region and the White Mountains further to the north.
* [[File:I-95.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 95]] runs north–south briefly along New Hampshire's seacoast to serve the city of [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]], before entering [[Maine]]
* [[File:US 1.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 1]] runs north–south briefly along New Hampshire's seacoast to the east of and paralleling I-95.
* [[File:US 2.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 2]] runs east–west through [[Coos County, New Hampshire|Coos County]] from Maine, intersecting [[New Hampshire Route 16|Route 16]], skirting the [[White Mountain National Forest]] passing through [[Jefferson, New Hampshire|Jefferson]] and into Vermont.
* [[File:US 3.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 3]] is the longest numbered route in the state, and the only one to run completely through the state from the Massachusetts border to the Canada–U.S. border. It generally parallels [[Interstate 93]]. South of Manchester, it takes a more westerly route through [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]]. North of Franconia Notch, U.S.{{spaces}}3 takes a more easterly route, before terminating at the Canada–U.S. border.
* [[File:US 4.svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 4]] terminates at the [[Portsmouth Traffic Circle]] and runs east–west across the southern part of the state connecting [[Durham, New Hampshire|Durham]], Concord, [[Boscawen, New Hampshire|Boscawen]], and Lebanon.
* [[File:NH Route 16.svg|20px]] [[New Hampshire Route 16]] is a major north–south highway in the eastern part of the state that generally parallels the border with [[Maine]], eventually entering Maine as Maine Route 16. The southernmost portion of NH 16 is a four-lane freeway, co-signed with U.S. Route{{spaces}}4.
* [[File:NH Route 101.svg|20px]] [[New Hampshire Route 101]] is a major east–west highway in the southern part of the state that connects [[Keene, New Hampshire|Keene]] with [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] and the Seacoast region. East of Manchester, NH 101 is a four-lane, limited-access highway that runs to [[Hampton Beach, New Hampshire|Hampton Beach]] and I-95.
