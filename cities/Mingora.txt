==History==
The area around Mingora has long been inhabited.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THh8AgAAQBAJ&q=Mingora+hindu+buddhist&pg=PP45|title = Pakistan-Japan Relations: Continuity and Change in Economic Relations and Security Interests|isbn = 9781134041961|last1 = Malik|first1 = Ahmad Rashid|date = 3 September 2008| publisher=Routledge }}</ref> At [[Loe Banr]], Butkara II and Matalai, Italian [[archaeologist]]s unearthed 475 [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]] graves dated between 1520 and 170 BC and two horse skeletons.<ref>Augusto Azzaroli, Two Proto-historic Horse Skeletons from Swāt, Pakistan, ''East and West'', Vol. 25, No. 3/4 (September–December 1975), pp. 353-357: [https://www.jstor.org/stable/29756092]</ref> On the opposite side of the [[Swat River|River Swat]] at [[Aligrama]], near the [[Saidu Sharif]] airport, a site of [[Gandhara grave culture]] was discovered by Italian archaeologists and dated to 1000 BC.

Buddhism arose in the region with the arrival of monks from the Gangetic plains. Under Emperor [[Ashoka]], [[Buddhism]] became firmly established in the region, and the region became a launching ground for Ashoka's expansion of Buddhist [[missionaries]] to the western regions from the [[Mediterranean]] and [[West Asia]]. Many Buddhist remains and carvings<ref>https://korbah.com/carvings {{Dead link|date=February 2022}}</ref> have been discovered near Mingora in the Jambil River Valley. At Panr, a [[stupa]] and monastery dated to the 1st century [[Common Era|CE]] has been excavated. In Mingora, [[Faxian]] claimed to have seen the biggest Buddhist [[monastery]], and large carving of the foot-prints of Buddha carved on the sides of the ridges at Teerat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JfhwAAAAMAAJ&q=Mingora+hindu+buddhist|title = Journal of Asian Civilisations|year = 2001}}</ref> Excavations at the [[Butkara Stupa]] near Mingora revealed a large and imposing central stupa surrounded by more than 200 votive stupas which were discovered by Pakistani archeologist in the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u59PAAAAMAAJ&q=Mingora+hindu+buddhist|title = Architecture and Art Treasures in Pakistan: Prehistoric, Protohistoric, Buddhist, and Hindu Periods|last1 = Khan|first1 = F.

Following the collapse of Buddhist rule, direct control of the area came under the [[Hindu Shahi]]s. Their rule marked the ascent of [[Hinduism]] and Hindu polity in the region once again, after centuries of Buddhist rule and domination of the area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w3qaAAAAIAAJ&q=Mingora+hindu+buddhist|title = Population Census of Pakistan, 1972: Sukkur|year = 1975| last1=(Pakistan) | first1=Census Organization }}</ref> Their rule came to an end with the rise of the Islamic empire of [[Mahmud Ghazni]].

In 2007 during the rise of the [[Insurgency in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|Taliban insurgency]], Mingora was invaded by the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Taliban]], largely impacting traditional culture in Mingora. A year later, the militant leader [[Fazlullah (militant leader)|Fazlullah]], then leader of [[Tehreek-e-Nafaz-e-Shariat-e-Mohammadi]], established a pirated [[FM broadcasting|FM channel]] in the nearby Mamdheri village, approximately five kilometers away from Mingora.<ref name=":0" /> Fazlullah subsequently became leader of Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan in [[Swat Valley]], encompassing the entirety of Mingora.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/275813/pakistan-urges-afghan-action-against-taliban-leader/|title=Mullah Radio: Pakistan urges Afghan action against Maulvi Fazlullah|date=2011-10-17|website=The Express Tribune|language=en|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/8144772.stm|title=Swat Taliban chief 'near death'|date=2009-07-10|access-date=2019-08-25|language=en-GB}}</ref> The oppression of [[Girls education|girls' education]], [[Polio eradication|Polio treatments]], and [[freedom of expresion|freedom of expression]] became imminent throughout Mingora as a result, causing challenges for residents.

Most of the city's income comes from treads and tourism. The people of the uplands mostly pay attention to Mingora for buying and selling which includes Dir, [[Shangla District|Shangla]], 

The [[Operation Rah e Raast|Operation Rah-e-Raast]] in 2009 placed Mingora back into Pakistani control.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://southasiajournal.net/7577-2/|title=Operation Rah-e-Raast liberating Swat valley from extremism – South Asia Journal|date=19 February 2017 |language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>
