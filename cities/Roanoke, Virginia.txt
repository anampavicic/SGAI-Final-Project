'''Roanoke''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|r|oʊ|.|ə|ˌ|n|oʊ|k}} {{respell|ROH|ə|nohk}}) is an [[Independent city (United States)|independent city]] in the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] in the United States. It is located in [[Southwest Virginia]] along the [[Roanoke River]], in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains|Blue Ridge]] range of the greater [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Roanoke is approximately {{Convert|50|mi|km}} north of the Virginia{{Endash}}[[North Carolina]] border and {{Convert|250|mi|km}} southwest of [[Washington, D.C.]], along [[Interstate 81]]. At the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], Roanoke's population was 100,011, making it the most-populous city in Virginia west of the state capital [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].<ref name="QF">{{cite web |title=QuickFacts Roanoke city, Virginia |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/roanokecityvirginia |access-date=September 7, 2021 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |archive-date=June 22, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210622181022/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/roanokecityvirginia |url-status=live}}</ref> It is the primary population center of the [[Roanoke metropolitan area]], which had a population of 315,251 in 2020.

The [[Roanoke Valley]] was originally home to members of the [[Siouan languages|Siouan]]-speaking [[Tutelo]] tribe. However, in the 17th and early-to-mid 18th centuries, [[Scotch-Irish Americans|Scotch-Irish]] and later [[German Americans|German American]] farmers gradually drove those [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] out of the area as the [[American frontier]] pressed westward. In 1882, the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (N&W) chose the small town of Big Lick as the site of its corporate headquarters and [[Roanoke Shops|railroad shops]]. Within two years, the town had become the City of Roanoke. With a 2,300% population growth rate in the decade from 1880 to 1890, the young city experienced the advantages and disadvantages of its [[boomtown]] status. During the 20th century, Roanoke's boundaries expanded through multiple [[Municipal annexation|annexations]] from the surrounding [[Roanoke County, Virginia|Roanoke County]], and it became Southwest Virginia's economic and cultural hub. The 1982 decision by N&W to relocate their headquarters out of the city, combined with other manufacturing closures, led Roanoke to pivot to a primarily [[service economy]]. In the 21st century, a robust [[healthcare industry]] and the development and increased marketing of its outdoor amenities have helped reverse prior [[Population decline|declining population trends]].

Roanoke is known for the [[Roanoke Star]], an {{Convert|88.5|ft||-tall|adj=mid}} illuminated star that sits atop a mountain within the city's limits and is the origin of its nickname, "The Star City of the South". Other points of interest include the [[Hotel Roanoke]], a 330-room Tudor Revival structure built by N&W in 1882, the [[Taubman Museum of Art]], designed by architect [[Randall Stout]], and the city's [[Roanoke City Market Historic District|farmer's market]], the oldest continuously operating open-air market in the state. The Roanoke Valley features 26 miles of greenways with bicycle and pedestrian trails, and the city's location in the Blue Ridge Mountains provides access to numerous [[outdoor recreation]] opportunities.

==History==

=== Early history and incorporation ===
The current site of Roanoke lies near the intersection of the [[Great Wagon Road]] and the [[Carolina Road]], two branches of a network of early colonial roads that developed from Native American trails in the [[Appalachia]]n region.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rouse, Jr. |first=Parke |title=The Great Wagon Road: From Philadelphia to the South |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |year=1973 |isbn=978-0-07-054101-6}}</ref> While the name ''Roanoke'' is said to have originated from a Native American word for shell beads used as [[shell money|currency]],<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Otto |first=Paul |date=2017 |title="This is that which...they call Wampum" Europeans Coming to Terms With Native Shell Beads |url=https://digitalcommons.georgefox.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1075&context=hist_fac |journal=Faculty Publications - Department of History, Politics, and International Studies |issue=77}}</ref> that word was first used {{convert|300|mi|km}} away, where the [[Roanoke River]] empties into the Atlantic Ocean near [[Roanoke Island]].<ref name="Kagey">{{Cite book |last=Kagey |first=Deedie |title=When Past is Prologue: A History of Roanoke County |publisher=Roanoke County Sesquicentennial Committee |year=1988 |page=7}}</ref> The [[Roanoke Valley]] itself was originally home to members of the [[Tutelo]] tribe,<ref name="Kagey" /><ref name="Griffin-1942">{{Cite journal |last=Griffin |first=James B. |date=1942 |title=On the Historic Location of the Tutelo and the Mohetan in the Ohio Valley |journal=American Anthropologist |language=en |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=275–280 |doi=10.1525/aa.1942.44.2.02a00080 |issn=0002-7294 |doi-access=free}}</ref> a [[Siouan languages|Siouan]]-speaking people who were gradually pushed out of the area by advancing European settlers.<ref name="Griffin-1942" />

The railroad built its new [[Train station|depot]] just south of a small town named Gainesborough, but named the depot after Big Lick, another small community located just to the east, which itself was named after the salt deposits that had drawn game to the area for years.{{r|White-1982|p=49}}{{r|Dotson|p=2}} Gainesborough increasingly became referred to as Big Lick (and later as Old Lick) once development drifted farther south towards the depot.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hill Studio |date=February 2004 |title=Historic Architectural Survey of and National Register Nominations for Roanoke Downtown Historic District |url=https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/pdf_files/SpecialCollections/RN-086_Histoirc_AH_Survey_RoanokeDowntownHD_2004_HILL_report.pdf |access-date=May 24, 2023 |archive-date=May 31, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531171008/https://www.dhr.virginia.gov/pdf_files/SpecialCollections/RN-086_Histoirc_AH_Survey_RoanokeDowntownHD_2004_HILL_report.pdf |url-status=live}}</ref> Growth in the area was stalled by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]; Roanoke County voted 850–0 in favor of [[secession]] and lost many of its men in the subsequent fighting.{{r|White-1982|p=53}} The burgeoning [[Tobacco industry|tobacco trade]] helped the region's recovery during [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]. Within a decade of the war's end, there were no fewer than six tobacco factories near the Big Lick Depot.{{r|White-1982|p=58}}

In 1874, the community surrounding the depot applied for and received a town charter, and the Town of Big Lick was formally established.{{r|Barnes-1968|p=71}} Eight years later, efforts by town boosters succeeded in securing Big Lick as the junction of the [[Shenandoah Valley Railroad (1867–1890)|Shenandoah Valley Railroad]] and the [[Norfolk and Western Railway]] (N&W).{{r|White-1982|p=65}} The two companies also relocated their respective headquarters to the town (the two lines would officially merge in 1890).{{r|White-1982|p=70}}{{r|Barnes-1968|p=204}} Big Lick's relatively small size compared to the nearby county seat, [[Salem, Virginia|Salem]], worked in its favor as a draw for the companies. Big Lick's ample farmland and nearby water sources were well suited to the railroads' goal of building much of the town from scratch, including railroad shops, offices, a hotel, and suitable housing for their many employees.{{r|Barnes-1968|p=86}}{{r|Dotson|p=8}}
[[File:Roanoke_Hotel_1910.jpg|left|thumb|251x251px|[[Hotel Roanoke]] as it appeared in 1910.

In the early 1880s, Big Lick's residents voted to rename the town "Kimball" after [[Frederick J. Kimball]], an executive for the two railroad companies who played a significant role in their new location.{{r|Dotson|p=10}} Kimball turned down the honor, saying, "On the Roanoke River in Roanoke County – name it Roanoke."{{r|Barnes-1968|p=90}} The town obliged, officially becoming the Town of Roanoke on February 3, 1882.{{r|White-1982|p=65}} The new charter also [[Municipal annexation|annexed]] nearly two and a half square miles of additional land, including the Town of Gainesborough (later shortened to [[Gainsboro, Roanoke, Virginia|Gainsboro]]), which by that point had already become the center of the area's African American community.<ref>{{Cite web |last=City of Roanoke Planning Building and Development |title=Gainsboro Neighborhood Plan - History |url=https://www.roanokeva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1232/Gainsboro |access-date=May 26, 2023 |website=Roanoke Document Center |archive-date=May 31, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230531171010/https://www.roanokeva.gov/DocumentCenter/View/1232/Gainsboro |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Shareef |first=Reginald |title=The Roanoke Valley's African American Heritage: A Pictorial History |publisher=The Donning Company |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-89865-962-7}}</ref>{{rp|153}} Kimball chose a wheat field north of the railroad tracks and east of Gainsboro for the N&W's new hotel,{{r|White-1982|p=66}} and the 69-room [[Hotel Roanoke]] – designed originally in the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne]] style before numerous rebuilds and expansions gave it its current [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] appearance – opened its doors in 1882.{{r|Dotson|p=12}}

With the rapid influx of railroad employees and others in associated industries, Roanoke's population soared and, by the end of 1883, had passed 5,000.{{r|White-1982|p=71}} That milestone made the town eligible for a [[Municipal charter|city charter]], and on January 31, 1884, the town became the City of Roanoke.{{r|Barnes-1968|p=135}}

With a population that ballooned from under 700 residents in 1880 to over 16,000 in 1890<ref name="DecennialCensus">{{cite web |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/umn.31951t00383932e |title=Census of Population:1950 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |hdl=2027/umn.31951t00383932e |access-date=August 2, 2023}}</ref> {{endash}} and earning itself the nickname "The Magic City" in the process{{r|Dotson|p=1}} {{endash}} Roanoke suffered many of the same difficulties that affected other 19th century [[boomtown]]s.<ref name=Dybdahl>{{cite news |last=Dybdahl |first=Pete |date=December 19, 2007 |title=Growing Pains |work=The Roanoke Times |page=1}}</ref> Its infrastructure was essentially nonexistent, and a lack of sewers combined with the area's [[Marsh|marshy terrain]] contributed to regular outbreaks of [[diphtheria]] and [[cholera]].{{r|Dotson|p=37}} [[Municipal bond|Bond initiatives]] designed to alleviate these and other issues highlighted racial tensions in the city, as the African American community – roughly 30 percent of Roanoke's population in 1891{{r|Dotson|p=105}} – opposed the measures because the money would only be used to improve white neighborhoods.{{r|Dotson|p=42}} Black neighborhoods in Roanoke typically received public amenities such as running water and paved roads only after their white counterparts, and Roanoke was among the first to adopt the [[Jim Crow laws]] that were becoming increasingly popular in the South.{{r|Dotson|p=108}} The local press, for its part, stoked the white population's fears and anxiety with near-constant reports of African American "savagery".{{r|Dotson|p=125}}<ref>{{Cite news |date=February 2, 1901 |title=Crime of the Century |work=The Roanoke Times |page=4}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=February 13, 1896 |title=Men Worse Than Apes |work=The Roanoke Times |page=3}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=May 1, 1894 |title=Brutal Work at Staunton |work=The Roanoke Times |page=1}}</ref>

In September 1893, tensions boiled over when a white woman was allegedly robbed and beaten by an African-American man, Thomas Smith, near the city's market.{{r|White-1982|p=78}} Smith was held in the city jail; a mob of hundreds surrounded the building and demanded "[[Lynching|lynch justice]]".{{r|Dotson|p=135}} A shootout between the mob and an undermanned militia ensued, leaving eight dead and thirty-one more injured. Included among the wounded was the city's mayor, the previously widely admired [[Henry S. Trout]],{{r|Dotson|p=134}} who had vowed protection of the prisoner.{{r|White-1982|p=79}} The rioting mob was eventually successful in gaining control of Smith. They proceeded to hang him and mutilate his body, which was eventually burned when the mob was deterred from its initial plan to bury it in Mayor Trout's front yard.{{r|Dotson|p=140}} The mayor himself was forced to flee the city out of fear for his life and only returned a week later after the national press condemned the riot and praised Trout's courage during the event.{{r|Dotson|p=145}}
