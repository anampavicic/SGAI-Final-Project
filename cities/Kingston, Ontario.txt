'''Kingston''' is a city in [[Ontario]], Canada, on the northeastern end of [[Lake Ontario]]. It is at the beginning of the [[St. Lawrence River]] and at the mouth of the [[Cataraqui River]], the south end of the [[Rideau Canal]]. Kingston is near the [[Thousand Islands]], a tourist region to the east, and the [[Prince Edward County, Ontario|Prince Edward County]] tourist region to the west. Kingston is nicknamed the "Limestone City" because it has many heritage buildings constructed using local [[limestone]].

Growing European exploration in the 17th century and the desire for the Europeans to establish a presence close to local Native occupants to control trade led to the founding of a [[New France|French]] [[trading post]] and military fort at a site known as "Cataraqui" (generally pronounced {{IPAc-en|k|æ|t|ə|'|ɹ|ɒ|k|w|eɪ}} {{respell|ka|tə|ROK|way}}) in 1673. The outpost, called Fort Cataraqui, and later [[Fort Frontenac]], became a focus for settlement. After the [[Conquest of New France]] (1759–1763), the site of Kingston was relinquished to the British.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=37 |doi=10.3138/9781442618503 |isbn=978-1-4426-1850-3 }}</ref> Cataraqui was renamed Kingston after the British took possession of the fort, and [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] began settling the region in the 1780s.

Kingston was named the first capital of the [[United Province of Canada]] on February 10, 1841.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;81</ref> While its time as a capital city was short and ended in 1844, the community has remained an important military installation. The city is a regional centre of education and health care, being home to a major university, a large vocational college, and three major hospitals.

Kingston was the county seat of [[Frontenac County]] until 1998. Kingston is now a separate municipality from the County of Frontenac. Kingston is the largest municipality in southeastern Ontario and Ontario's [[List of census metropolitan areas and agglomerations in Canada|10th largest metropolitan area]]. [[John A. Macdonald]], the first [[Prime Minister of Canada]] lived in Kingston.

==History==

===Naming history and etymology===

Cataraqui, Kingston's original name, is a derivation of an [[Languages of Canada#Indigenous languages|Indigenous]] name for the Kingston area. The word may mean "Great Meeting Place", "the place where one hides", "impregnable", "muddy river", "place of retreat", "clay bank rising out of the water", "where the rivers and lake meet", "rocks standing in water", or "place where the limestone (or clay) is".<ref>[http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/Cataraqui-CanadianHistory.htm Quebec History – Cataraqui] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304052924/http://faculty.marianopolis.edu/c.belanger/quebechistory/encyclopedia/Cataraqui-CanadianHistory.htm |date=March 4, 2016 }} Retrieved April 12, 2014</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cataraqui Archaeological Research Foundation – About|url=https://www.carf.info/about.html |access-date=2023-08-15}}</ref><ref>[http://www.buildingstories.co/report.php?ListType=tour_data&ID=25&lang=fr Histoires de Bâtiment – Naval Historic Sites – Kingston] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413185554/http://www.buildingstories.co/report.php?ListType=tour_data&ID=25&lang=fr |date=April 13, 2014 }} Retrieved April 12, 2014</ref><ref>[http://canada.yodelout.com/kingston-ontario-settlement-and-early-days/ All About Canada, Kingston, Ontario-Settlement and Early Days] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413141204/http://canada.yodelout.com/kingston-ontario-settlement-and-early-days/ |date=April 13, 2014 }} Retrieved April 12, 2014</ref><ref name="Brown">{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Ron |year=2011 |title=Hidden Ontario: Secrets from Ontario's Past |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXk3yUgj1yYC&pg=PA99 |location=Toronto |publisher=Dundurn |pages=98–100 |isbn=978-1554889556 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328004321/https://books.google.com/books?id=uXk3yUgj1yYC&pg=PA99 |archive-date=March 28, 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewhig.com/opinion/columnists/celebrating-lemoine-point-farm |title= Celebrating Lemoine Point Farm |last=Young|first=Susan |date=November 20, 2021 |publisher=The Kingston Whig-Standard|access-date=January 12, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Indigenous People – City of Kingston |url=https://www.cityofkingston.ca/explore/culture-history/history/indigenous-people |access-date=2023-07-04 |website=cityofkingston.ca}}</ref>

Cataraqui was referred to as "the King's Town" or "King's Town" by 1787, in honour of King [[George III]]. The name was abbreviated to "Kingston" in 1788.<ref name=armstrong67>Armstrong 1973, p.&nbsp;67.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca/chronology.html|title=Chronology of the History of Kingston|publisher=Kingston Historical Society|access-date=June 28, 2012|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085741/http://kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca/chronology.html|archive-date=April 26, 2012}}</ref> Cataraqui today is an area around the intersection of [[Princess Street (Kingston, Ontario)|Princess Street]] and Sydenham Road, where the village of Cataraqui (formerly known as Waterloo) was located. Cataraqui is also the name of a municipal electoral district.

===Early Indigenous habitation===

[[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence suggests people lived in the Kingston region as early as the [[Archaic period in North America|Archaic Period]] (about 9,000–3,000 years ago).<ref>[http://www.pecounty.on.ca/pdf/MicrosoftWord-ArchaeologyintheCounty.pdf ''Archaeology in the County – Traces of the First People in Prehistoric Prince Edward County''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309045303/http://pecounty.on.ca/pdf/MicrosoftWord-ArchaeologyintheCounty.pdf |date=March 9, 2013 }} Retrieved March 4, 2015</ref><ref>[http://www.ontarioarchaeology.on.ca/summary/archaic.htm ''The Archaic Period''.

At the time the French arrived in the Kingston area, [[Iroquois|Five Nations Iroquois]] (Haudenosaunee) had settled along the north shore of Lake Ontario.<ref>Adams 1986, p.&nbsp;6</ref> Although the area around the south end of the Cataraqui River was often visited by Iroquois and other groups, Iroquois settlement at this location only began after the French established their outpost.<ref>Adams 1986, pp. 5, 9</ref> By 1700, the [[Iroquois settlement of the north shore of Lake Ontario|north shore Iroquois]] had moved south, and the area once occupied by the Iroquois (which includes Kingston) became occupied by the [[Mississaugas]], a subtribe of the [[Anishinaabe]], who had moved south from the [[Lake Huron]] and [[Lake Simcoe]] regions.<ref>Osborne 2011, pp. 13, 19</ref>

===French settlement and Fort Frontenac===
European commercial and military influence and activities centred on the [[North American fur trade|fur trade]] developed and increased in North America in the 17th century. Fur trappers and traders were spreading out from their centres of operation in New France. French explorer [[Samuel de Champlain]] visited the Kingston area in 1615.<ref name="kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca">{{cite web|url=http://www.kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca/chronology.html|title=Kingston Historical Society Chronology of the History of Kingston|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426085741/http://kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca/chronology.html|archive-date=April 26, 2012}}</ref>
[[File:Fort Frontenac 1759.jpg|thumb|"View of Frontenac or Cataracoui in 1759". Watercolour map depicting Fort Frontenac.]]
To establish a presence on Lake Ontario for the purpose of controlling the fur trade with local indigenous people, [[Louis de Buade de Frontenac]], [[Governor of New France]] established Fort Cataraqui, later to be called Fort Frontenac, at a location known as Cataraqui in 1673.<ref name="kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca"/> The fort served as a trading post and military base, and gradually attracted indigenous and European settlement. In 1674, [[René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle]] was appointed commandant of the fort. From this base, de La Salle explored west and south as far as the Gulf of Mexico.<ref name="kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca"/> The fort was rebuilt several times and experienced periods of abandonment. The Iroquois siege of 1688 led to many deaths, after which the French destroyed the fort, but would rebuild it. The British destroyed the fort during the [[Battle of Fort Frontenac]] ([[Seven Years' War]]) in 1758 and its ruins remained abandoned until the British took possession and partially reconstructed it in 1783. The fort was renamed Tête-de-Pont Barracks in 1787. It was turned over to the Canadian military in 1870–71 and is still being used by the military. It was renamed Fort Frontenac in 1939.<ref>[http://www.forces.gc.ca/assets/FORCES_Internet/docs/en/training-establishments/ff-history-cacsc-eng.pdf A History of Fort Frontenac] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140806141428/http://forces.gc.ca/assets/FORCES_Internet/docs/en/training-establishments/ff-history-cacsc-eng.pdf |date=August 6, 2014 }} Retrieved December 8, 2017</ref> Partially reconstructed parts of the original fort can be seen today at the western end of the [[La Salle Causeway]].

===Loyalist settlement===

In 1783, [[Frederick Haldimand]], governor of the [[Province of Quebec (1763–1791)|Province of Quebec]] directed Major [[Samuel Holland (surveyor)|Samuel Holland]], Surveyor-General of Quebec, to lay out a settlement for displaced [[British Empire|British]] colonists, or [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]], who were fleeing north because of the [[American Revolutionary War]] and "minutely examine the situation and site of the Post formerly occupied by the French, and the land and country adjacent". Haldimand had originally considered the site as a possible location to settle loyal [[Mohawks]].<ref name="Osborne18">Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;18</ref> The survey would also determine whether Cataraqui was suitable as a navy base since nearby [[Carleton Island]] on which a British navy base was located had been ceded to the Americans after the war. Holland's report about the old French post mentioned "every part surpassed the favorable idea I had formed of it", that it had "advantageous Situations" and that "the harbour is in every respect Good and most conveniently situated to command Lake Ontario".<ref name="Osborne18"/> Major [[John Ross (American Revolution)|John Ross]], commanding officer of the [[King's Royal Regiment of New York]] at [[Fort Oswego|Oswego]] partly rebuilt Fort Frontenac in 1783. As commander, he played a significant role in establishing the Cataraqui settlement.

To facilitate settlement, the [[The Crown|British Crown]] entered into an agreement with the Mississaugas in October 1783 to purchase land east of the [[Bay of Quinte]]. Known as the [[Crawford Purchase]], this agreement enabled settlement for much of the eastern section of the north shore of Lake Ontario.<ref>Osborne 2011, pp. 19–21</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Frontenac44.html|title=The Crawford Purchase|website=Ontario's Historical Plaques|access-date=December 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219001019/http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Frontenac44.html|archive-date=December 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> With the completion of the Mississauga agreement, settlement could proceed, although the planning of the layout of the townsite had not waited for the completion of the negotiations. The area was surveyed, and the survey report mentioned the area was deemed to have productive lands, abundant resources, a good harbour and an existing townsite. These requirements were considered ideal to settle the Loyalists.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;22</ref> Three kinds of refugee Loyalists would settle at Cataraqui: 'associated' or 'incorporated' Loyalists who were organized into companies under militia officers, provincial colonial regiments and their dependents, and unincorporated Loyalists who came to Canada independently.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Preston |editor1-first=Richard A. |title=Kingston before the War of 1812: A Collection of Documents (Ontario Series) |date=1959 |publisher=The Publications of the Champlain Society |page=49 |doi=10.3138/9781442618503 |isbn=978-1-4426-1850-3 }}</ref>

Many Loyalist refugees had at first settled on Carleton Island, and operated businesses there. When the Island was ceded to the United States after the Revolutionary War, these Loyalists, along with their businesses, relocated to Cataraqui.

Notable Loyalists who settled in the Cataraqui area include [[Molly Brant]] (the sister of Six Nations leader [[Joseph Brant]]); businessman and political figure [[Richard Cartwright (born 1759)|Richard Cartwright]]; [[John Stuart (priest)|John Stuart]], a clergyman, missionary and educator who arrived in 1785; and militia captain [[Johan Jost Herkimer]]. A group of Loyalists from New York State, led by Captain [[Michael Grass]] who arrived in 1784 after sailing from [[New York City|New York]] and up the St. Lawrence River, established a camp south of Fort Frontenac at Mississauga Point.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;23</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Frontenac17.html|title=Loyalist Landing at Cataracoui 1784|website=Ontario's Historical Plaques|access-date=December 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219001031/http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Frontenac17.html|archive-date=December 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> The first name given to the settlement by the Loyalists was King's Town, which would eventually develop into the current appellation.<ref name="Brown"/>

The first high school (grammar school) in what later became the province of Ontario was established in Kingston in 1792 by Loyalist priest John Stuart, which evolved into [[Kingston Collegiate and Vocational Institute]].

===War of 1812, and development===

During the [[War of 1812]], Kingston (with a population of 2,250)<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXk3yUgj1yYC&q=Kingston,+ontario&pg=PA99|title=Hidden Ontario: Secrets from Ontario's Past|first=Terry|last=Boyle|date=May 30, 2011|publisher=Dundurn|isbn=9781459700291|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180328004321/https://books.google.com/books?id=uXk3yUgj1yYC&pg=PA99&dq=Kingston,+ontario&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiBna2wxr7TAhVL7YMKHfRMD744HhDoAQg3MAQ#v=onepage&q=Kingston,+ontario&f=false|archive-date=March 28, 2018}}</ref> was a major military centre.

Kingston's location at the Rideau Canal entrance to Lake Ontario made it the primary military and economic centre of Upper Canada after canal construction was completed in 1832. It was incorporated as a town in 1838; the first [[List of mayors of Kingston, Ontario|mayor of Kingston]] was [[Thomas Kirkpatrick (Canadian politician)|Thomas Kirkpatrick]].<ref name="kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca"/> Kingston had the largest population of any centre in Upper Canada until the 1840s. Kingston was incorporated as a city in 1846.

Kingston became an important port as businesses relating to [[transshipment]], or forwarding, grew. Since Kingston was at the junction of the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario, commodities shipped along the lake from the west such as wheat, flour, meat, and [[potash]] were unloaded and stored at Kingston to await transfer to vessels that could navigate the risky St. Lawrence. With the completion of the Rideau Canal, cargoes could be transported in a safer fashion since the St. Lawrence River route could be bypassed.

===As Canada's first capital===
Governor General [[Charles Poulett Thomson, 1st Baron Sydenham|Lord Sydenham]] chose Kingston as the first capital of the united [[Province of Canada|Canadas]], and it served in that role from 1841 to 1844. The first meeting of the Parliament of the Province of Canada on June 13, 1841, was held on the site of what is now [[Kingston General Hospital]]. The city was considered too small and lacking in amenities, however, and its location near the border made it vulnerable to American attack. Consequently, the capital was moved to [[Montreal]] in 1844,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Frontenac48.html |title=Legislature of the Province of Canada 1841–1844 |access-date=December 18, 2018 |website=Ontario's Historical Plaques |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219001155/http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Frontenac48.html |archive-date=December 19, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> and it alternated between [[Quebec City]] and [[Toronto]] from 1849 until [[Ottawa]], then a small lumber village known as Bytown, was selected as the permanent capital by [[Queen Victoria]]. Subsequently, Kingston's growth slowed considerably and its national importance declined.

In 1846, with a population of 6,123, Kingston was incorporated as a city, with [[John Counter]] as the first mayor.<ref name="kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca"/> By that time, there were stone buildings, both residential and commercial. The [[Kingston City Hall (Ontario)|market house]] was particularly noteworthy as "the finest and most substantial building in Canada" which contained many offices, government offices, space for church services, the post office, the City Hall (completed in 1844)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Frontenac55.html|title=Kingston City Hall Historical Plaque|website=ontarioplaques.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170426063656/http://ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Frontenac55.html|archive-date=April 26, 2017}}</ref> and more.

The [[Grand Trunk Railway]] arrived in Kingston in 1856, providing service to Toronto in the west, and to Montreal in the east. Its Kingston station was {{convert|2|mi|km|order=flip}} north of downtown. Kingston became an important rail centre, for both passengers and cargo, due to difficulty travelling by ship through the rapids-and-shoal-filled river.

By 1869, the population had increased to 15,000, and there were four banks. There were two ship building yards.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/provinceontario00mcevgoog#page/n290/mode/2up|title=The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory|publisher=Robertson & Cook|date=1869|page=243|isbn=9780665094125|access-date=December 18, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306134022/http://www.archive.org/stream/provinceontario00mcevgoog#page/n290/mode/2up|archive-date=March 6, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>

Kingston was the home of Canada's first [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]], [[John A. Macdonald]]. He won his first election to Kingston City Council in 1843, and would later represent the city for nearly 50 years at the national level, both before and after [[Confederation]] in 1867.

In the early hours of April 18, 1840, a dock fire, fanned by high winds, spread to a warehouse containing between 70 and 100 kegs of gunpowder. The resulting explosion spread the fire throughout the city's downtown area, destroying a large number of buildings, including the old city hall. To prevent similar incidents from occurring in future, the city began building with limestone or brick. This rebuilding phase was referred to as "the Limestone Revolution" and earned the city the nickname "The Limestone City".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.thewhig.com/2010/02/11/fire-and-gunpowder-explosions-demolished-kingstons-waterfront |title=Fire and gunpowder explosions demolished Kingston's waterfront |newspaper=Kingston Whig-Standard |date=February 8, 2010 |archive-date=January 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180103072604/http://www.thewhig.com/2010/02/11/fire-and-gunpowder-explosions-demolished-kingstons-waterfront|access-date=December 18, 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.kingstonpublicmarket.ca/about/history Kingston Public Market History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150619042910/http://www.kingstonpublicmarket.ca/about/history |date=June 19, 2015 }} Retrieved October 8, 2015</ref><ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;99</ref>

A telephone system began operation in Kingston in 1881; at that time the population was 14,091. Electricity was not available in Kingston until 1888.

Kingston grew moderately through the 20th century through a series of annexations of lands in adjacent Kingston Township, including a 1952 annexation of some {{convert|5500|acre|km2}}<ref name="kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca"/> which encompassed areas west to the [[Little Cataraqui Creek]] (including the village of Portsmouth), where a number of large residential subdivisions were built in the late 1950s and early '60s.

Kingston's economy gradually evolved from an industrial to an institutional base after World War II. Queen's University grew from about 2,000 students in the 1940s to its present size of over 28,000 students, more than 90 per cent of whom are from outside the Kingston area. The Kingston campus of [[St. Lawrence College, Ontario|St. Lawrence College]] was established in 1969, and the college has 6,700 full-time students. The Royal Military College of Canada was founded in 1876, and has about 1,000 students. Kingston is a regional health care centre, anchored by Kingston General Hospital and the medical school at Queen's. The city's economy is also dominated by post-secondary education, military institutions, and prison installations.

Municipal governance had been a topic of discussion since the mid-1970s due to financial imbalance between the city and the surrounding [[Township (Canada)|townships]], which now had large residential areas and a population approaching that of the city proper. On January 1, 1998, the city was amalgamated with Kingston Township and [[Pittsburgh, Kingston|Pittsburgh Township]] to form the new City of Kingston. The city's boundaries now encompass large rural areas north of [[Highway 401]] and east of the Cataraqui River.

Kingston, being strategically located at the head of the St. Lawrence River and at the mouth of the Cataraqui River near the border with the United States, has been a site of military importance since Fort Frontenac was built in 1673. The French and, later, the British established military garrisons. The War of 1812 led to the bolstering of military troops, the servicing of ships, and the building of new fortifications to defend the town and the [[Kingston Royal Naval Dockyard|Naval Dockyard]]. Forts were constructed on Point Henry and at [[Point Frederick (Kingston, Ontario)|Point Frederick]]. A picket wall, or [[stockade]], incorporating five [[blockhouses]] was built to the west of the town, and [[Artillery battery|batteries]] were constructed.<ref>Osborne 2011, p.&nbsp;50</ref><ref>Mika 1987, p.&nbsp;44</ref> In November 1812 American naval forces attacked the British sloop [[HMS Royal George (1809)|Royal George]] in Kingston harbour but the ship took refuge in the harbour and the American forces withdrew.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Lennox14.html |website=Ontario's Historical Plaques |title=The Escape of the Royal George |access-date=December 8, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171209044411/http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Lennox14.html |archive-date=December 9, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Several defensive fortifications were constructed in the late 1840s because of tensions with the United States. These include Fort Henry, four Martello towers ([[Cathcart Tower]], [[Shoal Tower]], [[Murney Tower]], and [[Fort Frederick (Kingston, Ontario)|Fort Frederick]]), and the [[Kingston City Hall (Ontario)#Market Battery|Market Battery]]. Military ships were built at the Naval Dockyard at [[Point Frederick (Kingston, Ontario)|Point Frederick]] from 1788 to 1853. The peninsula near the entrance of the later Royal Military College of Canada was the headquarters of the Royal Navy in between 1813 and 1853. (Fort Frederick, built in 1812–13, was also on this peninsula.)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Frontenac33.html |title=Point Frederick Buildings |access-date=December 18, 2018 |website=Ontario's Historical Plaques |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181219044540/http://www.ontarioplaques.com/Plaques/Plaque_Frontenac33.html |archive-date=December 19, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the British army withdrew from most locations in Canada in 1870–71, two batteries of garrison artillery were formed by the Dominion Government; the "A" Battery was in Kingston at Fort Henry and Tête du Pont Barracks (Fort Frontenac). (The other battery was in Quebec City)<ref name="kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca"/> The batteries were also schools of gunnery. Designated as the ''Regiment of Canadian Artillery'', the regular component evolved into the [[Royal Canadian Horse Artillery]].

Following the withdrawal of British forces from Canada in 1870–71, the federal government recognized the need for an officer training college in Canada. In 1874, during the administration of the Hon. Alexander Mackenzie, enabling legislation was passed. Located on Point Frederick, the site of the former Royal Naval Dockyard,

Before a formal college was established in 1876, there were proposals for military colleges in Canada. Staffed by British Regulars, students underwent a military course in 1865 at the School of Military Instruction in Kingston. The school enabled officers of militia or candidates for commission or promotion in the militia to learn military duties, drill and discipline, to command a company at Battalion Drill, to Drill a Company at Company Drill, the internal economy of a Company and the duties of a Company's Officer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~theislands/photos6/ansonkeillmilcert.jpg|title=RootsWeb.com Home Page|website=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407162844/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~theislands/photos6/ansonkeillmilcert.jpg|archive-date=April 7, 2016|access-date=June 7, 2016}}</ref> The school was retained at Confederation, in 1867.<ref>Richard Preston 'Canada's RMC: A History of the Royal Military College of Canada' published by the RMC Club by U of Toronto Press.</ref>

The withdrawal of imperial troops required a Canadian location for the training of military officers. Because of Kingston's military tradition and the fact several military buildings already existed at the old naval dockyard, Point Frederick was chosen as the location for Canada's first military college, the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC). The facility, called simply The Military College until 1878, opened on Point Frederick with 18 students in 1876<ref name="kingstonhistoricalsociety.ca"/> under Lt.-Col. Edward O.

Located east of Kingston's downtown, the army's Camp Barriefield, now McNaughton Barracks, was constructed at the beginning of the World War I and expanded during the [[World War II]]. Camp Barriefield was named in honour of Rear-Admiral [[Robert Barrie]] (May 5, 1774 – June 7, 1841), a British naval officer noted for his service in the War of 1812. It was later named McNaughton Barracks after [[Andrew McNaughton|Andrew George Latta McNaughton]], a former minister of national defence. Nearby Vimy Barracks was established in 1937 for the [[Royal Canadian Corps of Signals]] (later the Royal Canadian School of Signals). Vimy and McNaughton Barracks house the Canadian Forces School of Communications and Electronics (CFSCE), the [[Canadian Forces]]' military communications training centre and several other units. McNaughton Barracks and Vimy Barracks make up most of [[Canadian Forces Base Kingston]] (CFB Kingston). Major military facilities supported by CFB Kingston include Fort Frontenac, on the site of the original fort, and the Royal Military College of Canada.

===Religion===
[[File:Sydenham Street Methodist Church, Kingston, Canada 1910.jpg|thumb|[[Sydenham Street Methodist Church]] in 1910. It was built in 1852 and later expanded.]]
In 2021, 65,490 Kingston residents, or about half of the population, were members of Christian groups; the largest were Roman Catholics, who numbered 30,385 (23.5%), the [[United Church of Canada]] (8,575 or 6.6%), and the [[Anglican Church of Canada]] (8,600 or 6.7%).

The Presbyterian Church was particularly influential in the 19th century development of Kingston post-secondary education. The church was a founder and financial supporter of Queen's University until 1912 when it was agreed the university should become a secular institution.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the University|url=http://www.queensu.ca/calendars/artsci/History_of_the_University.html|work=website|publisher=Queen's University|access-date=February 4, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718135143/http://www.queensu.ca/calendars/artsci/History_of_the_University.html|archive-date=July 18, 2014}}</ref> John A. Macdonald was also a member of [[St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church (Kingston, Ontario)|St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church]] in Kingston.

The religious history of the city can still be seen in the monumental stone churches throughout the downtown core, some of which now serve as community<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 1, 2020|title=The Spire|url=https://www.thespirekingston.org/}}</ref> and co-working spaces.<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 1, 2020|title=Sanctuary Co-Working Space|url=https://www.sanctuarycoworking.ca/}}</ref> Newer churches in the city like Reunion Kingston,<ref>{{Cite web|date=September 1, 2020|title=Reunion Kingstion|url=https://www.reunionkingston.com/}}</ref> tend to seek rental options rather than building new physical spaces.

Groups other than Christians and the non-religious include Muslims (3,375 or 2.6%), Hindus (1,670 or 1.3%), and Jews (875 or 0.7%).<ref name="2011 NHS Religion">{{cite web |url=http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3510010&Data=Count&SearchText=kingston&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=Religion&B1=All&Custom=&amp;TABID=1 |title=National Household Survey (NHS) Profile, 2011 |publisher=Statistics Canada |date=May 10, 2013 |access-date=August 29, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073606/http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&Geo1=CSD&Code1=3510010&Data=Count&SearchText=kingston&SearchType=Begins&SearchPR=01&A1=Religion&B1=All&Custom=&TABID=1 |archive-date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>

55,355 people, or 42.9% of the population, identified as non-religious.

==Government==
=== Municipal ===
For its municipal government, the city is divided into 12 wards; each elects one councillor. All voters in the city cast ballots for the mayor, currently [[Bryan Paterson]], an economics professor at the Royal Military College of Canada. Paterson was re-elected in the [[2022 Ontario municipal elections]] for the 2022–2026 term.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/city-council/mayor-and-council|title=Mayor & Councillors – City of Kingston|website=cityofkingston.ca|access-date=April 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410083341/https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/city-council/mayor-and-council|archive-date=April 10, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Election Results |url=https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/elections/results |publisher=City of Kingston |access-date=18 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170913230758/https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/elections/results |archive-date=September 13, 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The councillors elected for the same term were:

* Gary Oosterhof – Countryside District (acclaimed)
* Paul Chaves – Loyalist-Cataraqui District
* Lisa Osanic – Collins-Bayridge District
* Wendy Stephen – Lakeside District
* Don Amos – Portsmouth District
* Jamshed (Jimmy) Hassan – Trillium District

On November 20, 2018, Kingston City Council received [https://www.cityofkingston.ca/documents/10180/30671807/City-Council_Meeting-24-2018_Report-18-384_2018-Municipal-Election-Results-of-Referendum-Question-and-Potential-Next-Steps.pdf/67581acd-85a5-4a07-b936-a741a5fce123 Report 18-384] which presented the results of the 2018 ranked choice ballots referendum question and outlined potential next steps. The Municipal Elections Act requires that at least 50 percent of the total number of eligible electors in the municipality must vote on the referendum question in order for the results to be "binding". Based on the official 2018 election results the number of eligible electors was 83,608. The total number of electors that voted on the referendum question was 32,803 or 39.2 percent of eligible electors.<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 20, 2018|title=2018 Municipal Election Results of Referendum Question and Potential Next Steps|url=https://www.cityofkingston.ca/documents/10180/30671807/City-Council_Meeting-24-2018_Report-18-384_2018-Municipal-Election-Results-of-Referendum-Question-and-Potential-Next-Steps.pdf/67581acd-85a5-4a07-b936-a741a5fce123|website=City of Kingston Municipal Government}}</ref> Since 50 percent of eligible electors did not vote on the referendum question, the results are not "binding" on Council. Of the electors that voted on the referendum question, 62.9 percent were in favour of using ranked choice voting to elect the mayor and district councillors. Although the result of the referendum question is not "binding", Council has directed staff to initiate the process to implement ranked choice voting for the 2022 municipal election.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Ranked Choice|url=https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/elections/ranked-ballots|website=City of Kingston|access-date=October 5, 2020|archive-date=October 7, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201007002226/https://www.cityofkingston.ca/city-hall/elections/ranked-ballots|url-status=dead}}</ref>

A by-law to establish ranked choice elections has not been passed to elect City of Kingston Mayor and District Councillors. The required ranked choice Voting Bylaw would have to be passed by May 1, 2021. The Ontario provincial government introduced in October 2020 Bill 218, ''[https://www.ola.org/en/legislative-business/bills/parliament-42/session-1/bill-218 Supporting Ontario's Recovery and Municipal Elections Act, 2020],'' which revoked the regulation that would allow municipalities to conduct elections using ranked ballots. The Bill received Royal Assent on November 20, 2020.

The most important sectors are related to [[Healthcare in Canada|health care]], higher education (Queen's University, the Royal Military College of Canada, and St. Lawrence College), government (including the military and correctional services), [[tourism in Canada|tourism]] and [[Culture of Canada|culture]]. [[Manufacturing]], and [[research and development]] play a smaller role than in the past. The private sector accounts for half of Kingston's employment.<ref name="employment">[http://business.kingstoncanada.com/en/statistics/majoremployers.asp Kingston Major Employers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150304010936/http://business.kingstoncanada.com/en/statistics/majoremployers.asp |date=March 4, 2015 }} Retrieved: March 15, 2015</ref> One of Kingston's major industrial employers of the 20th century, the Canadian Locomotive Company, closed in 1969, and the former [[Alcan]] and [[DuPont]] operations employ far fewer people than in the past.

==Correctional institutions and facilities==
Kingston has the largest concentration of federal correctional facilities in Canada. The facilities are operated by the Correctional Service of Canada. Of the nine institutions in the Kingston area, seven are within the city's municipal boundaries.

Until 2000, Canada's only federal correctional facility for women, the Prison for Women (nicknamed "P4W") was also in Kingston. As a result of the report of the ''Commission of Inquiry into Certain Events at the Prison for Women in Kingston'', the facility was closed in 2000. Queen's University purchased the property with the intention of renovating it to house the Queen's Archives, but the interior of the building was awarded a heritage designation; therefore, Queen's lost the ability to renovate the interior and is considering its options.{{Citation needed|date=December 2023}}

In September 2013, after almost 180 years of housing prisoners, Kingston Penitentiary closed. The maximum security prison was named a [[National Historic Site of Canada]] in February 1990 due to its history and reputation. In its early years, the prison had a vital role in constructing the city. The prison brought prosperity to Kingston, and along with eight other prisons being built in the area, helped create an impressive local economy.<ref>Steve Cameron, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/kingston-penitentiary-closes-its-doors-as-canadas-most-famous-prison/article14598900/?page=all "Kingston Penitentiary: Canada's most famous prison closes its doors"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071218/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/kingston-penitentiary-closes-its-doors-as-canadas-most-famous-prison/article14598900/?page=all |date=March 4, 2016 }}, ''The Globe and Mail'', September 29, 2013</ref>

===Hockey===
Kingston lays claim to being the birthplace of [[ice hockey]], though this is contested. Support for this is found in a journal entry of a British Army officer in Kingston in 1843. He wrote ''"Began to skate this year, improved quickly and had great fun at hockey on the ice."''<ref name="queens">{{cite web|title=Hockey night in Kingston |url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/article.php?point=vol133/issue11/features/lead1 |access-date=June 21, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Kingston is also home to the oldest continuing hockey rivalry in the world by virtue of a game played in 1886 on the frozen Kingston harbour between Queen's University and the Royal Military College of Canada. To mark this event, the city hosts an annual game between the two institutions, played on a cleared patch of frozen lake with both teams wearing period-correct uniforms and using rules from that era. The two schools also contest the annual Carr-Harris Cup, named for [[Lorne Carr-Harris]], under modern competitive conditions to commemorate and continue their rivalry.

The [[Memorial Cup]], which serves as the annual championship event for the [[Canadian Hockey League]], began in 1919 on the initiative of Kingstonian [[James T. Sutherland]]. The first championship was held in Kingston. Sutherland, a member of the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]], also helped establish the annual exhibition game between the Royal Military College of Canada and the [[United States Military Academy]] (West Point) in 1923.

Kingston is represented in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL) by the [[Kingston Frontenacs]]. Kingston had a team in the [[Ontario Junior Hockey League]] (OJHL), the [[Kingston Voyageurs]] but ceased after the 2018–19 season.

The [[International Hockey Hall of Fame]], was established in September 1943 with a building constructed in 1965. The original building was near the [[Kingston Memorial Centre]] (which was opened in 1950), but has since been relocated to Kingston's west end at the Invista Centre.

[[List of shipwrecks of Canada#Ontario|Kingston's shipwrecks]] are well preserved by its cool fresh water, and the recent [[zebra mussel]] invasion has caused a dramatic improvement in water clarity that has enhanced the quality of diving in the area.

===Lawn bowling===
The Kingston Lawn Bowling Club has been at its location on Napier Street since 1932, although the sport's beginnings in Kingston have been traced back to 1914.<ref>[https://kingstonlawnbowlingclub.weebly.com/about-us.html Kingston Lawn Bowling Club – About Us] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160514141551/http://kingstonlawnbowlingclub.weebly.com/about-us.html |date=May 14, 2016 }} Retrieved November 22, 2018</ref> While the club offers a variety of recreational opportunities, a number of its members have gone on to compete successfully at the provincial level and beyond.

The Kingston area has eight golf courses, two of which are entirely public.<ref>[http://www.ontgolf.ca/city.php?city=kingston OnGolf.ca – Kingston Golf Courses – Ontario Canada] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104223737/http://www.ontgolf.ca/city.php?city=kingston |date=January 4, 2011 }} Retrieved March 2, 2011</ref> The Kingston Golf Club, established in 1884, was a founding member of the [[Golf Canada|Royal Canadian Golf Association]] in 1895; however, this club ceased operating in the mid-1920s. The first winner of the [[Canadian Amateur Championship]] that same year was Kingstonian Thomas Harley, a Scottish immigrant carpenter. Richard H. (Dick) Green, who immigrated to the area from England in the late 1920s, was the longtime club professional for nearly 40 years at [[Cataraqui Golf and Country Club]] (founded in 1917 and redesigned by [[Stanley Thompson]] in 1930).
