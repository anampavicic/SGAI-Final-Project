Located southwest of the city there are [[quartzite]] quarries. The stone is traditionally used in construction. There is a huge area of [[farms]] in the rural areas surrounding the city, specialized mostly in the cultivation of [[vegetables]].

'''Pre-Spanish era''': The region was inhabited by ''Günuna Kena'' nomads (also known as northern [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelches]]). They were later (after the 11th century) strongly influenced by the [[Mapuche]] culture.

'''1577–1857''': First European explorers. [[Francis Drake|Sir Francis Drake]] made a reconnaissance of the coast and its [[sea lion]] colonies; Don [[Juan de Garay]] explored the area by land a few years later, in 1581. In 1742, during the [[War of Jenkins' Ear]], eight survivors of {{HMS|Wager|1739|6}}, part of [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|Admiral Anson]] expedition and led by midshipman Isaac Morris, lived through a ten-month ordeal before being decimated and captured by the [[Tehuelche people|Tehuelches]], who eventually handed them to the Spaniards. After holding the Englishmen as prisoners, they returned Morris and his surviving companions to London in 1746.<ref>[http://patlibros.org/mim/chp1.php?lan=eng#prof Historical Materials from Southern Patagonia]</ref> First colonization attempt by [[Jesuit]] Order near [[Laguna de los Padres]] ended in disaster (1751).

'''1857–1874''': The [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entrepreneur José Coelho de Meirelles, taking advantage of the country's abundance of wild cattle, built a pier and a factory for [[salted meat]] near [[Cabo Corrientes, Mar del Plata|Cabo Corrientes]], but the business only lasted a few years.<ref>{{citation|page=131 |last1=Crowder |first1=Patricia |first2=Fededico I. |last2=Isla |first3=Guillermo |last3=Denegri |first4=Alberto |last4=Farías |first5=Leonardo |last5=Cermelo  |title=Mar del Plata: Fragilidad Costera|publisher=MARTIN - Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata|location=Argentina|year=2005}}</ref>

'''1874–1886''': [[Patricio Peralta Ramos]] acquired the now abandoned factory along with the surrounding terrain, and founded the town on February 10, 1874. [[Basques|Basque]] rancher Pedro Luro bought a part of Peralta Ramos land for agricultural production. First docks also erected around this time.

'''1886–1911''': The railway line from [[Buenos Aires]], built by the [[Buenos Aires Great Southern Railway|Buenos Aires Great Southern]] reached Mar del Plata in 1886; the first hotels started their activity. The upper-class people from Buenos Aires became the first tourists of the new born village. They also established a local government that reflected their conservative ideals. Build-up of a French style resort. On 19 July 1907, the provincial legislature approved a bill that declared Mar del Plata as a city.<ref name = mdpcom>{{cite web |url= http://www.mdp.com.ar/historia |language = es |title= Síntesis Histórica |access-date= June 16, 2015}}</ref>

'''1911–1930''': The residents, mostly newly arrived emigrants from Europe, demanded and obtained the control of the Municipality administration. The socialists were the mainstream political force in this period, carrying out social reforms and public investment. The main port was also built and inaugurated in 1916.

'''1930–1946''': A military coup reinstated the [[Conservatism|Conservative]] hegemony in politics through electoral fraud and corruption, but at local levels they were quite progressive, their policies viewed in some way as a continuity of the socialist trend. In 1932, the construction of [[Provincial Route 2 (Buenos Aires)|National Route 2]] was completed, which connected Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.covisursa.com.ar/Texto/inicio13.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070310173138/http://www.covisursa.com.ar/Texto/inicio13.htm |archive-date=10 March 2007 |language = es |title= Historia de la Ruta 2 |publisher= Covisur |access-date= June 16, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author=Guillermo Kraft |title=Cuatro años de gobierno 1936–1940, volume IV Vialidad |year=1940 |publisher=Gobierno de la Provincia de Buenos Aires}}</ref> Before this, a dirt road connected Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires using a different route, required almost two days to travel by car.<ref name="cmdp">''El camino a Mar del Plata'', Dirección Nacional de Vialidad, 1934</ref> The seaside ''Casino'' complex opened in 1939, was designed by architect [[Alejandro Bustillo]], dates from this period.

'''1946–1955''': Birth of the [[Peronism|Peronist]] movement. A coalition between socialists and radicals defeated this new party by a narrow margin in Mar del Plata, but by 1948 Peronism came to dominate the local administration. The massive tourism, triggered by the [[social welfare|welfare politic]]s of [[Juan Perón|Perón]] and the surge of the middle class marked a huge growth in the city's economy.

'''1955–1970''': After the [[Revolución Libertadora|fall of Perón]], the [[Socialism|socialists]] regained the upper hand in local politics; the city reached the peak in activities like construction business and building industry. There was massive emigration from other regions of Argentina.

'''1970–1989''': Slight decline of tourism demand, counterbalanced by the increase of other industries such as fishing and machinery. General infrastructure renewal under the military rule. The centrist [[Radical Civic Union]] becomes the main political force after the [[Argentine general election, 1983|return of Democracy in 1983]].

'''1989–2010''': Though [[Peronism]] replaced the radicals in central government amid a national financial crisis, the latter party continued to rule in Mar del Plata. Some resurgence of mass tourism in the early '90s was followed by a deep social crisis in town, with an increase of poverty, jobless rates and emigration. By contrast, the first decade of the 21st century shows an amazingly quick recovery in all sectors of the ailing economy.

In November 2005 the city hosted the [[4th Summit of the Americas]].

== Culture ==

== Architecture ==
{{See also|Mar del Plata style}}
[[File:Villa-Normandie.jpg|thumb|175px|Villa Normandy, built in 1919]]
[[File:Chalet Mar del Plata (2009).jpg|thumb|left|210px|An example of "Mar del Plata Style" house]]

The development of the city as a seasonal summer resort in the early 20th century led upper class tourists from Buenos Aires to build a European-inspired architecture, based mainly on the [[picturesque]] and later on the [[art deco]] styles. This gave Mar del Plata the nickname of the ''Argentine [[Biarritz]]''. The [[building industry]] became the main non-seasonal activity of the town by 1920.

During the 1930s, 1940s, and beyond, local architects and builders, like Auro Tiribelli, Arturo Lemmi, Alberto Córsico-Picollini and Raúl Camusso recreated and transformed the picturesque values into a middle-class scale, marking the beginning of a [[vernacular architecture]], called [[Mar del Plata style|Mar del Plata Style]], consisting in small samples of the luxury-laden summer residences of high society, built for the summer visitor as well as for the local resident.

These [[chalet]]s were built with stone [[Facade|''façades'']], [[gable]] roofs covered with Spanish or French tiles, prominent [[eaves]] and front [[porch]]es. This gives the town some distinctive urban character compared with other [[Architecture of Argentina|Argentine]] cities, despite the fact that the growing mass of tourists in the '60s imposed the construction of large apartment buildings and skyscrapers as the predominant architectural style downtown.<ref>Cacopardo, Chapter VII (by Javier Sáez)</ref>

== Climate ==
Mar del Plata has an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]), with humid and moderate summers and relatively cool winters, although polar [[air masses]] from [[Antarctica]] are frequent. The average daily mean temperature in January is {{convert|20.4|°C|0|abbr=on}}. It is  {{convert|7.5|°C|0|abbr=on}} in July. The West-Southwest winds can take the temperature below {{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}} between mid May and early October, while the Southeast ones (the so-called ''[[Sudestada]]'') are stronger, producing coastal showers and rough seas, as well as strong squalls, but the cold is much less intense.<ref name="Roccatagliata">Roccatagliata, pp. 167–174</ref> There is [[fog]] in the last days of fall, and springtime is often marred by sea winds and sudden temperature changes. 
[[File:NieveEnPlayaGrande.jpg|thumb|200px|left|A snowy winter's day at Playa Grande, July 10, 2004]]

The city's summer maximum temperatures fluctuate broadly around the average of {{convert|26|°C|0|abbr=on}}: while there are many days between {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|35|°C|0|abbr=on}} (although less than in other areas of the Pampas region), strong on-shore or southerly winds can also keep temperatures closer to {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}}, and nights can sometimes be very cool even in midsummer (falling below {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}} sometimes). However, the summer nights are usually cool to pleasant, with values between {{convert|12|°C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|16|°C|0|abbr=on}}.
Traditionally, Easter is seen as the "last" weekend to go to the beach on the [[Argentine Atlantic Coast]], and average maximum temperatures are around {{convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on}} at that time. While some years can have the last few days of about {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} around that time, it is also possible to experience daily highs of {{convert|15|°C|0|abbr=on}}.
Winter temperatures average {{convert|13|°C|0|abbr=on}} during the day and {{convert|4|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night; they sometimes climb to {{convert|22|°C|0|abbr=on}} especially in August, but there are also days where highs stay below {{convert|6|°C|0|abbr=on}} and temperatures fall some degrees below {{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}} at night.

Spring brings the most variable weather, with heat waves bringing highs of more than {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} followed by highs of {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}} to {{convert|15|°C|0|abbr=on}} and perhaps a late-season frosty night all perfectly possible in October and November.

There are about six days of frost each year in the city center, and almost 27 recorded at the airport.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.arquinstal.com.ar/atlas/datos/00anual.html| language = es |title = Datos bioclimáticos de 173 localidades argentinas–Anuales | work = Atlas Bioclimáticos | publisher = Universidad Nacional de La Plata | access-date = June 10, 2015}}</ref> The average dates for the first and last frost are May 23 and October 4 respectively.<ref name = ORA>{{cite web |url = http://www.ora.gov.ar/eval_decadial.php |title = Mar del Plata, Buenos Aires |work = Estadísticas meteorológicas decadiales |publisher = Oficina de Riesgo Agropecuario |language = es |access-date = June 10, 2015}}</ref>  Snowfall is not uncommon, but snow accumulation on the ground is rare, a phenomenon that takes place every six years or so, according to the 1960-2004 data.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Salio |first=Paola |last2=Campetella |first2=Claudia |last3=Ruiz |first3=Juan |last4=Garcia Skabar |first4=Yanina |last5=Nicolini |first5=Matilde |date=1 December 2006 |title=Nevadas en el Sudeste Bonaerense: climatología sinóptica y un caso de estudio |url=http://www.scielo.org.ar/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&pid=S1850-468X2006000100005&lng=es&nrm=iso&tlng=es |journal=Meteorologica |language=es |volume=31 |issue=1-2 |pages=67–83 |issn=1850-468X}}</ref> Among the best known such occurrences in the last decades were the 1975 and 1991 snowstorms, but there were also snow accumulations in 1994 and 1997 in the highest hills area of [[Sierra de los Padres]], in 1995 along the southern coast; the other two during the first hours of July 10, 2004<ref name=":0" /> and July 15, 2010,<ref>[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1285279 ''Una ola de frío invade a todo el país''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719211658/http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1285279 |date=2010-07-19 }} La Nación, 15 July 2010 {{in lang|es}}</ref> and again in Sierra de los Padres and the southern coast on September 11, 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Las mejores fotos de la nevada en Sierra de los Padres| date=11 September 2015 |url = http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1827019-pronostico-del-tiempo-frio-baja-sensacion-termica-nevadas|access-date = 2015-09-13}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title = Diez días antes de la primavera, una ola de frío llevó nieve a lugares inesperados| date=12 September 2015 |url = http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1827342-diez-dias-antes-de-la-primavera-una-ola-de-frio-llevo-nieve-a-lugares-inesperados|access-date = 2015-09-13}}</ref> There were [[Snow flurry|flurries]] in September 1986, June 2007, July 2011 and August 2013.<ref>Retrieved from the following editions of ''La Capital'' newspaper:
