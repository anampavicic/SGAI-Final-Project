'''Vũng Tàu''' (''Hanoi accent:'' {{IPA|vi|vuŋm˧ˀ˥ taːw˨˩||Vung Tau Northern.ogg}}, ''Saigon accent:'' {{IPA|vi|vuŋm˧˩˧ taːw˨˩||Vũng Tàu.oga}}) is the largest city of [[Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province]] in southern [[Vietnam]]. It is the province's economic, financial and cultural centre, and a popular tourist hub in [[southern Vietnam]]. The city area is {{convert|141.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=off}}, consists of 16 urban wards and one [[commune of Vietnam|commune]] of Long Sơn Island. Vũng Tàu was the [[capital city|capital]] of the province until it was replaced by the much smaller [[Bà Rịa]] city on 2 May 2012. The city is also the [[crude oil]] extraction center of Vietnam.<ref>[http://tourcualo.com/events/categories/cua-lo Overview of cua lo beach in Vietnamese on official website]</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
Since April 2015, Vũng Tàu consists of 16 wards (phường): [[Ward 1, Vũng Tàu|1]], [[Ward 2, Vũng Tàu|2]], [[Ward 3, Vũng Tàu|3]], [[Ward 4, Vũng Tàu|4]], [[Ward 5, Vũng Tàu|5]], [[Ward 7, Vũng Tàu|7]], [[Ward 8, Vũng Tàu|8]], [[Ward 9, Vũng Tàu|9]], [[Ward 10, Vũng Tàu|10]], [[Ward 11, Vũng Tàu|11]], [[Ward 12, Vũng Tàu|12]], [[Thắng Nhất]], [[Thắng Nhì]] (former [[Ward 6, Vũng Tàu|Ward 6]]), [[Thắng Tam]], [[Nguyễn An Ninh (ward)|Nguyễn An Ninh]], [[Rạch Dừa]], and the commune (xã) of [[Long Sơn, Vũng Tàu|Long Sơn]].

The wards are divided into quarters (khu phố), which are divided into smaller groups (tổ dân phố). The commune is divided into hamlets (thôn).

According to archeological excavations in 2002 and [[2005]] in Giồng Lớn, a coastal sandbank in Long Sơn island, humans have existed about [[2nd millennium BC|2000 BCE]]. Evidence of burial sites, working tools, clay pots, jewelleries, weapons and other tools suggested close connections with [[Óc Eo Culture|Óc Eo culture]] and trade activities with nearby countries.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2008-08-30 |title=Excavation at the Giong Lon site |url=https://baotanglichsu.vn/en/Articles/3186/8376/excavation-at-the-giong-lon-site.html |website=Vietnam Museum of National History}}</ref>

Between [[1st century|1st]] and [[7th centuries]], Vung Tau was ruled by [[Funan]], who were replaced by the [[Chenla|Chenla Kingdom]]. Little is known of Vũng Tàu during the Funan and Chenla period.

In 1295, [[Zhou Daguan]] ({{Lang-zh|c=周達觀}}), a Yuan Chinese diplomat serving under [[Temür Khan|Temur Khan]], passed by Vũng Tàu on his official voyage to Angkor, Chenla. In his book ''[[The Customs of Cambodia]]'' ({{Lang-zh|c=真臘風土記|p=Zhēnlà Fēngtǔ Jì}}, literally ''Chenla Culture and Land Report'') referred to Vũng Tàu as Zhenpu 真蒲, which he described as the border of Chenla.<blockquote>自溫州開洋，行丁未針。歷閩、廣海外諸州港口，過七洲洋，經交趾洋到占城。又自占城順風可半月到'''真蒲'''，乃其境也。<ref>{{Cite web |last=Zhou |first=Daguan |date=2007 |others=Translated by Peter Harris |title=A Record of Cambodia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rs4IBAAAQBAJ |website=Google Books}}</ref>

Since departing from Wenzhou, it has not done anything yet. It traveled through the ports of [[Fujian]] and [[Guangzhou]], crossed the Qizhou Sea, and reached Champa via the [[South China Sea|Jiaozhi Sea]]. Moreover, if the wind blows from [[Champa]], you can reach '''Zhenpu''' in half a month, which is its territory.</blockquote>During 14th and 15th centuries, the cape that would become Vũng Tàu was a swamp which European trading ships visited regularly. The ships' activities inspired the name Vũng Tàu, which means "[[wikt:anchorage|anchorage]]". The Portuguese referred to this place as ''Oporto Cinco Chagas'' or simply ''Cinco Chagas'' in their maps. Apres de Mannevillette (1707–1780), one of the greatest French chart-publishers, mentioned Saint Jacques in his book ''La Neptune Oriental''. This term was later adopted by Europeans and the French.
[[File:Portuguesee map of SouthEast Asia in the 17th century.jpg|thumb|A Portuguese map of 17th century mentioning Vung Tau as ''Cinco Chagas'']]
The [[French Indochina|French Indochinese]] government later named it '''Cap Saint-Jacques''' (''Cap Xanh Giac'', in Vietnamese). The cliff of Vũng Tàu is now called Mũi Nghinh Phong (literally meaning "Cape of breeze welcome" or "Cape of greeting the wind").

=== Vietnamese settlement ===
During the 16th and 17th century, conflicts caused by the opposing clans in the [[Trịnh–Nguyễn War]] led to emigrations of Vietnamese people from [[Thuận Hóa|Thuận Quảng]] to the coastal area near Vũng Tàu.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Tran |first=Nam Tien |year=2013 |title=Vai trò của Chúa Nguyễn đối với công cuộc khai phá và bảo vệ xứ Mô Xoài thế kỷ XVII |trans-title=Role of Nguyễn Lords in the exploitation and protection of Mô Xoài in the 17th century |url=https://vjol.info.vn/index.php/khxh/article/download/15164/13617/ |journal=Tạp chí Khoa học xã hội |volume=174 |pages=67}}</ref>

Vũng Tàu was originally referred to as Tam Thắng (“Three Boats”) in memory of the first three villages in this  area: Thắng Nhất, Thắng Nhị, Thắng Tam, within the province of [[Biên Hòa]] under the [[Nguyễn dynasty]]. Under the reign of king [[Gia Long]] (1761–1820), when [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] pirates built a base here and subsequently became a danger to traders in [[Gia Định]] city, the king sent 3 army detachments to crack down on the pirates. The pirates were defeated and the troops were given the land as an incentive to continue to protect the area. The villages, then named Thắng Nhất 勝一, Thắng Nhì 勝二, Thắng Tam 勝三 occupied arable areas at the southern tip and along the western shore of the peninsula.

The kings Gia Long, [[Minh Mạng]] and [[Thiệu Trị]] invested heavily into Vũng Tàu's protection, by opening various defensive facilities. A military barrack, Phước Thắng bảo 福勝堡, on the hill slope overlooking the Buffalo Cape, then called was built in 1839. The barrack was operated as a fortress and armed with 6 bronze cannons<ref>{{Cite web |last=Phạm |first=Chí Thân |date=2019-01-18 |title=Âm vang thần công Phước Thắng |url=https://baobariavungtau.com.vn/van-hoa-nghe-thuat/201901/am-vang-than-cong-phuoc-thang-835180/index.htm |website=Báo Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu}}</ref>

=== French colonisation ===
10 February [[1859]] marked the first use of cannons by Nguyễn's army, when they fired at French battleships from the fortress of Phước Thắng, located 100m from Vũng Tàu's Front Beach. This marked an important period in Vietnam's war against French invaders in southern Vietnam (then called [[Cochinchina]]).

In [[1876]], according to a decree by the French government, Vũng Tàu was merged in [[Bà Rịa|Bà Rịa county]] per [[Saigon]]'s administration. During the 1880s there were talks about moving Saigon's port facilities to Vũng Tàu, but this came to nothing due to Saigon's better infrastructure.<ref>''Saigon: A History'', p. 82, by Nghia M. Vo (2011): "There were talks about moving the port facilities to Vũng Tàu at the mouth of the river where ..."</ref>

On 1 May 1895, the governor of Cochinchina established by decree that Cap Saint Jacques would thereafter be an autonomous town. In 1898, Cap Saint Jacques was merged with Bà Rịa county once again, but re-divided in 1899. In 1901, the population of Vũng Tàu was 5,690, of which 2,000 persons were immigrants from northern Vietnam. Most of the town's population made their living in the fishing, farming and service industries. On 4 April 1905, Cap Saint Jacques was made an administrative district of Bà Rịa province. In 1929, Cap Saint Jacques became a province, and in 1934 became a city ([[Commune of Vietnam|commune]]).

Between 1885 and 1934 period, the French designed the town centre along the Front Beach, then named ''Baie de Cocotiers'', along with several notable architectural works for the administrative function such as ''l'Hôtel de l'Inpsection'', the Post Office, Grand Hotel and the Lighthouse.<ref>{{Cite book |title=État de la Cochinchine française en 1896 |publisher=Imprimerie commerciale REY |year=1899 |location=Saigon |pages=167 |language=fr}}</ref> In [[1898]], the French governor of [[French Indochina|Indochina]], [[Paul Doumer]] (who later became president of France), built the ''Villa Blanche'' in Vũng Tàu that is still a prominent landmark.

A national route was paved in 1896 (then called Colonial route 15), as well as a jetty in the Front Beach to connect Cap with Saigon.

{{Anchor|Massacre}}In the [[First Indochina War]] Vũng Tàu's military hospital facility was used by French soldiers on [[sick leave]].

On 21 July 1952 [[Viet Minh]] fighters disguising themselves in French military uniforms and armed with machetes, grenades, and [[Sten|Sten submachine guns]] snuck into the building's R&R centre, where a number of unarmed French officers were having dinner with their families. The rebels threw a  grenade from the kitchen killing the Vietnamese bartender, then shot the cook Nguyen Van Loc who was trying to play dead. Attackers stationed in the hallway found the four children of [[Air Vietnam]] President Jean Perrin-Christian, Elysabeth, Michel, and Nicole- who were playing a game of [[hide-and-seek]].  Elysabeth, Christian and Nicole were gunned down by the Viet Minh, and Michel who tried to run away was hacked to death with machetes. Now that the coast was clear they entered the dining room where the French customers were attacked with gunfire and grenade attacks. Twenty people including four Vietnamese civilians were killed in the attack, and 23 were injured. The only people to survive unharmed were a boy who hid behind a chair and a lieutenant who covered himself in a dead woman's blood to make it appear he was dead.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=1952-08-04 |title=INDO-CHINA: Massacre at Cap |language=en-US |magazine=Time |url=https://content.time.com/time/subscriber/article/0,33009,822397,00.html |access-date=2023-01-30 |issn=0040-781X}}</ref><ref>[https://www.tunnelrats.com.au/pdfs/newsletters/Holdfast-39.pdf Holdfast Newsletter]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Cape St. Jacques - Vung Tau |url=http://saigon-vietnam.fr/vungtau_en.php |access-date=2023-01-30 |website=saigon-vietnam.fr}}</ref>

=== South Vietnam ===
[[File:AMS - Vung Tau, Vietnam - NARA - 74797784.jpg|left|thumb|183x183px|A 1969 map of Vung Tau showing numerous military facilities in Vũng Tàu]]
After the [[1954 Geneva Conference|Geneva Agreement]] was signed, the State of Vietnam and [[Republic of Vietnam]] resettled 1 million people from the North to southern Vietnam, including more than 800,000 Catholic Christians. Three temporary resettlement camps were established in Vung Tau. The local government placed these new residents at key locations along Route 15 such as Ben Da, Thang Nhi, Thang Nhat, Rach Dua, Phuoc Thang and Phuoc Thanh, forming many religious Catholic parishes throughout the region.

With a strategic location right at the sea route close to the capital city of Saigon, the government of the Republic of Vietnam and its allies in the United States, Australia, and South Korea consolidated and developed Vung Tau into a strategic defense spot. After taking over French military facilities here, the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] established many large training facilities such as the Training Center for Rural Construction Officers, the Communications School, and the Military Police School, Cade School and Military Hospital.

During the [[Vietnam War]], the [[1st Australian Logistics Support Group]] was [[1st Australian Support Compound|based]] in Vũng Tàu &ndash; as were various United States military units at different times. Vũng Tàu also became popular for [[R&R (military)|R&R]], amongst in-country US, Australian and New Zealand personnel.<ref>Keith W. Nolan. ''Search and Destroy: The Story of an Armored Cavalry Squadron'' 2010, p. 35: "Harrington anticipated rendezvousing with his vehicles, supplies, and troops at the port city of Vũng Tàu in III Corps, then launching operations north-west of Sài Gòn with the 25th Division."</ref>

Due to its rising significance as a military base and coastal beach resort, Vung Tau attracted a large number of residents during the war time. Its population rose from 29,390 in 1955 to a whopping 119,300 in 1973.<ref name=":9">Gauthier, Julien. ''L'Indochine au travail dans la paix française''. Paris: Eyrolles, 1949. Tr 198</ref>

=== The fall of Vũng Tàu ===
In the last days of April 1975, many South Vietnamese troops retreated to Vũng Tàu as the communists closed on southern Vietnam. After the capture of Bà Rịa and [[Phước Tuy province|Phước Tuy Province]] on 27 April, the [[3rd Division (Vietnam)|3rd NVA Division]] forces began their attacks on Vũng Tàu. However, the Cỏ May bridge had been destroyed, and strong defense from ARVN Airborne at the south end of the bridge proved fatal to the northern forces. The Division's 12th Regiment was then landed by fishing boats behind the Airborne lines and this, together with a renewed attack by the 2nd Regiment, forced the Airborne to retreat into Vũng Tàu. At 01:30 on 30 April the Division began its attack on Vũng Tàu forcing the Airborne into the city center where they eventually succumbed at 11:00.<ref name="YellowStar_3rdDivision_Memoir">{{cite web |title=History of the Yellow Star Division |url=https://kilopad.com/Tieu-su-Hoi-ky-c12/lich-su-su-doan-sao-vang-b3580/trang-1-thong-tin |access-date=22 November 2021 |website=kilopad.com/Tieu-su-Hoi-ky-c12}}</ref><sup>:chapter 6</sup> <ref name="Veith">{{cite book |last=Veith |first=George |title=Black April The Fall of South Vietnam 1973-75 |publisher=Encounter Books |year=2012 |isbn=9781594035722 |page=132}}</ref>{{rp|476}}<ref>{{cite web |title=The 3rd - Yellow Star - Division in the Historic April |url=https://baokhanhhoa.vn/chinh-tri/202004/su-doan-3-sao-vang-trong-thang-tu-lich-su-8161741/ |access-date=27 November 2021 |website=baokhanhhoa.vn}}</ref> 

A fierce armed hostage crisis took place between the ARVN officers and the communists at Palace Hotel ended with the final surrender at 13:30.

=== Reunifed Vietnam ===
After the [[reunification of Vietnam]], Vũng Tàu was administered as a city under the [[Republic of South Vietnam|Republic of Southern Vietnam]]. Potilically, it is governed by the Military Administration Committee of Vũng Tàu City, led by Phạm Văn Hy (Tư Hy), Chairman, who is also the secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the City. In January 1976, a major adjustment of administrative boundary in southern Vietnam saw the merger of Vũng Tàu and three nearby provinces into [[Đồng Nai province|Đồng Nai]]. Vũng Tàu then became a district-level town (thị xã) of this new province. 

After the war, due to Vietnam being put under debilitating [[United States–Vietnam relations|trade embargoes]] by the United States and failing economy, Vũng Tàu was a common launching place for the "[[Vietnamese boat people]]" &ndash; refugees escaping the post-war Communist regime. The government-led nationalisation of private entreprises, collectivisation of the economy, central planning and money changes carried out in the post-war years brought in hardships for the majority of people.

=== Special zone ===
After oil was discovered in southern Vietnamese waters, the Vietnamese government pushed for the exploitation and extraction of this new resource. On 30 May 1979, Vũng Tàu was merged with [[Côn Đảo|Côn Đảo Islands]] to form Vũng Tàu-Côn Đảo Special Zone in a bid to facilitate the new service and logistics hub for the oil industry. Between 1980 and 1982, the city saw drastic changes in infrastructure and demographically was transformed into a service and logistics hub for the new industry. Politically, the Special zone was given the same status as provinces and centrally-run cities. Administratively, it was divided into 1 district (Côn Đảo) and 5 wards: Châu Thành, Thắng Nhất, Thắng Nhì, Thắng Tam, Phước Thắng and Long Sơn commune.

The central government assigned nearly 10,000 officers and professional engineers from many non-business units, industries, construction and the military. A seaport logistics service area serving the import and export of technical materials and petroleum products was established in a swamp area along the shore of Ganh Rai Bay.

After the signing of Soviet-Vietnam agreement on oil exploitation and establishment of [[Vietsovpetro]], the city welcomed more than 2,000 Soviet officials and experts to work in the joint venture. In order to create comfortable accommodation for the new workers, in 1985 the special zone government and the General Department of Petroleum built a separate dormitory for these people, often called the "5-storey area".<ref>{{cite web |date=2020-11-27 |author=Mai Thắng |title=Có một nước Nga giữa lòng phố biển |url=https://thanhtra.com.vn/xa-hoi/doi-song/co-mot-nuoc-nga-giua-long-pho-bien-174779.html |website=Thanh Tra}}</ref> Currently, this apartment complex still has more than 520 households with about 1,000 Russians living and working.

=== Provincial city ===
On 12 August 1991, the Special Zone was dissolved by a governmental decree. [[Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province]] was officially created from this former zone and nearby districts of Đồng Nai Province. Vũng Tàu once again was re-established as a ''thành phố'' (city).<ref>{{Cite web |date=1991-08-12 |title=National Assembly Decision on the Adjustment of Administrative boundaries of some provinces and municipalities |url=https://thuvienphapluat.vn/van-ban/Bo-may-hanh-chinh/Nghi-quyet-dieu-chinh-dia-gioi-hanh-chinh-mot-so-tinh-thanh-pho-truc-thuoc-Trung-uong-42808.aspx |website=Thư viện pháp luật}}</ref>

Success from [[Đổi Mới|Đổi mới]] and profits from seafood and petroleum exports brought a large budget source to Ba Ria-Vung Tau province, creating positive changes to repel the socio-economic crisis. The production value of economic sectors across the city only reached 271 billion VND at the time of establishment, by 2021, it reached 70,500 billion VND (260 times than the origin).<ref>{{cite web |website=PetroVietnam |date=2021-12-30 |access-date=2024-01-15 |language=vi |title=Thành phố Vũng Tàu tổ chức Lễ kỷ niệm 30 năm thành lập và đón nhận Huân chương Lao động hạng Ba |url=https://petrovietnam.petrotimes.vn/thanh-pho-vung-tau-to-chuc-le-ky-niem-30-nam-thanh-lap-va-don-nhan-huan-chuong-lao-dong-hang-ba-637603.html}}</ref>

The tourism and industrial production sectors began to thrive. In 1996, the city inaugurated Dong Xuyen Industrial Park.

In the late 1990s and 2000s, the city carried out a spectacular transformation with the construction and improvement of inner city roads, and the expansion of many key projects such as Le Hong Phong Road, Martyrs Memorial and Nga Nam roundabout. Ba Thang Hai Road (National Highway 51C) was also built and inaugurated during this period, replacing 30 Thang 4 (National Highway 51A) as the main road leading into the centre. As of 2023, 100% of roads and alleys were paved and solidified.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kim |first=Nguyễn |date=2023-07-07 |title=Hạ tầng cơ sở- sức bật để thúc đẩy ngành du lịch chuyển mình |url=https://vungtau.baria-vungtau.gov.vn/tin-tuc-noi-bat/-/view-content/527194/ha-tang-co-so-suc-bat-e-thuc-ay-nganh-du-lich-chuyen-minh |website=Thành phố Vũng Tàu}}</ref> The openings of Gò Găng and Cửa Lấp bridges helped connect Vũng Tàu with nearby districts faster.

Numerous commercial and urban developmental projects were established during the 2000s such as Vung Tau City Commercial Centre, Chi Linh Urban Area, Dai An Urban Area and A Chau Urban Area.

In 2012, the provincial administrative centre moved to [[Bà Rịa]].

==Economy and tourism==

===Shipping and oil exploration===
The city is located in the south of Vietnam, situated at the tip of a small [[peninsula]]. It has traditionally been a significant port, particularly during Vietnam's period of [[French Indochina|French rule]]. Today, the city's importance as a shipping port has diminished, but it still plays a significant role in Vietnam's offshore [[petroleum|oil]] industry. Vũng Tàu is the only petroleum base of Vietnam where [[crude oil]] and [[natural gas]] exploitation activities dominate the city's economy and contribute principal income to [[Economy of Vietnam|Vietnam's budget]] and export volume. Vũng Tàu shipyard's reconstruction was scheduled to be completed in 2008, supplied with up-to-date anchor handling supply vessels of [[Aker ASA|Aker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Shipping, shipbuilding, offshore news|work=Marinelog|date=3 May 2007|url=http://www.marinelog.com/DOCS/NEWSMMVII/2007may00030.html|access-date=1 June 2007}}</ref>

===Industry===
[[PEB Steel]] operates several factories in Vũng Tàu.<ref>{{cite press release | url = http://www.azobuild.com/news.asp?newsID=2087 | title = Second Factory Commissioned by PEB Steel | date = 3 April 2006 | author = PEB Steel}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | title = Steel firm opens fabrication plant | url = http://www.intellasia.net/steel-firm-opens-fabrication-plant-107889 | date = 11 September 2009 | publisher = Intellasia | newspaper = Viet Nam News | access-date = 22 October 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130616212225/http://www.intellasia.net/steel-firm-opens-fabrication-plant-107889 | archive-date = 16 June 2013 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref>

===Beaches===
Vũng Tàu has 4 extensive beaches, including Back Beach (Bãi Sau), Front Beach (Bãi Trước), Strawberry Beach (Bãi Dâu), Pineapple Beach (Bãi Dứa).

===Resorts and theme parks===
A big resort project has just been licensed by the Vietnamese government, the Saigon Atlantis. Upon completion, this entertainment project worth US$300 million in capital investment will include resorts, shopping and sailing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vvg-vietnam.com/cua_lap.htm|title=Cua Lap Resort; US$ 273 million beach resort in Vung Tau, Vietnam |publisher=Vietnam Venture Group }}</ref> The investor of this project is proposing to raise the investment capital to US$4 billion.

When they came bringing their original religion they built many Buddhist pagodas, temples and statues in the city. Three Buddhist temples in particular, [[Thích Ca Phật Đài]], Phổ Đà Sơn Quan Âm Bồ Tát Tự Temple, and Niết Bàn Tịnh Xá temple, draw pilgrims from around the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Beliefs in Vung Tau|work=Ba Ria-Vũng Tàu Tourism|url=http://bariavungtautourism.com/index.php?option=com_pages&id=21&Itemid=25&language=2}}</ref>
