'''Goma''' is the [[Capital city|capital]] and largest city of the [[North Kivu]] Province in the eastern region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It is located on the northern shore of [[Lake Kivu]] and shares borders with [[Bukumu Chiefdom]] to the north, Rwanda to the east and [[Masisi Territory]] to the west. The city lies in the [[Albertine Rift]], the western branch of the [[East African Rift]], and is only {{cvt|13|-|18|km}} south of the active volcano [[Mount Nyiragongo]]. With an approximate area of {{cvt|75.72|km2}}, the city has an estimated population of nearly 2 million people according to the 2022 census.

Goma is administratively divided into two urban municipalities: [[Goma (commune)|Goma]] and [[Karisimbi (commune)|Karisimbi]], which are further subdivided into 18 [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarters]], colloquially recognized as "[[Neighbourhood|neighborhoods]]" in the English lexicon. The city is home to several notable landmarks, including [[Goma International Airport]], the [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] [[Virunga National Park]], the private [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Mixed-sex education|co-educational]] school [[Adventist University of Goma]], the [[University of Goma]], and is also surrounded by the active [[Virunga Mountains|Virunga volcanic range]], which includes volcanoes [[Nyamuragira|Nyamulagira]], [[Mount Nyiragongo|Nyiragongo]], [[Mount Mikeno|Mikeno]], [[Mount Bisoke|Visoke]], [[Mount Gahinga|Gahinga]], [[Mount Karisimbi|Karisimbi]], and [[Mount Sabyinyo|Sabinyo]]. Goma also hosts the annual [[Festival Amani|Amani Festival]], the [[Free University of the Great Lakes Countries]], which supports local development initiatives, as well as the regional cultural center and art school, [[Foyer Culturel de Goma]].

The recent history of Goma has been dominated by the volcano and the [[Rwandan genocide]] of 1994, which in turn fuelled the [[First Congo War|First]] and [[Second Congo War]]s. The aftermath of these events was still having effects on the city and its surroundings in 2010. The city was captured by rebels of the [[March 23 Movement]] during the [[M23 rebellion]] in late 2012, but it has since been retaken by government forces.

== Etymology ==
The word ''Goma'' is possibly related to the [[ngoma drum]], which is generally associated with [[ritual dances]] and used by the [[Venda people]] in [[South Africa]] and [[Zimbabwe]], and also in [[Eastern Africa]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary for South African English |edition=Corrected |chapter=ngoma |publisher=Rhodes University |place=Makhanda, South Africa |date=2023 |author1=Van Niekerk, T. |author2=Le Du, B. |author3=Slater, R. |name-list-style=amp |chapter-url=https://dsae.co.za/entry/ngoma/e05157}}</ref> In western Congo, ''ngo'' is a [[Kikongo language|Kikongo]] word meaning "strength of the panther" and ''ma'' means "to give".<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Vinesett, A.L. |name-list-style=amp |author2=Whaley, R.R. |author3=Woods-Giscombe, C. |author4=Dennis, P. |author5=Johnson, M. |author6=Li, Y. |author7=Mounzeo, P. |author8=Baegne, M. |author9=Wilson, K.H. |year=2017 |title=Modified African Ngoma healing ceremony for stress reduction: A pilot study |journal=Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine |volume=23 |issue=10 |pages=800–804 |doi=10.1089/acm.2016.0410 |pmid=28910132 |pmc=5655458}}</ref>

The predominant terrain of Goma is [[Volcano|volcanic]], with only a small portion consisting of slightly [[sand]]y soil.<ref name=":3" /> The surface is covered with [[basalt]] flows, creating a [[Orthent|skeletal soil]] profile.

The vegetation in Goma is predominantly [[savanna]]h interspersed with [[Shrub|bushes]].<ref name=":4" /> The city's [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] appeal is further enhanced by [[Artificial plants|artificial greenery]], including trees planted by landowners, which mitigates temperature fluctuations. Hydrographically, Goma benefits from its southern proximity to Lake Kivu and smaller lakes such as Green Lake in Mugunga and Black Lake in Buhimba to the west.<ref name=":4" />

=== Climate ===
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies Goma's climate as a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'').<ref name="Climate-Data.org">{{Cite web |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/1074/ |title=Climate: Goma – Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table |publisher=Climate-Data.org |access-date=4 November 2013}}</ref> Goma is much milder than most climates of its latitude due to the city's high altitude, and sees warm days and pleasant nights year-round.

In response to concerns related to population density, administrative adjustments were made that resulted in the creation of new ''quartiers''. For instance, Katoyi ''quartier'' was divided into Kasika and Katoyi ''quartiers'', while Mabanga ''quartier'' was divided into Mabanga North and Mabanga South ''quartiers''.<ref name=":1" /> Parenthetically, the provincial authorities granted permission for the establishment of a new ''quartier'', Bujovu, within the [[Karisimbi (commune)| commune of Karisimbi]], comprising cells from the Majengo and Virunga ''quartiers'', namely Byahi and Tyazo cells.<ref name=":1" />

The village of Ngoma was a port for lake traffic and a crossroads for the overland trade routes between [[Central Africa]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. In 1894, the explorer [[Gustav Adolf von Götzen]], following the footsteps of an earlier missionary, was traveling to Rwanda from the eastern coast of Africa and passed through the village, which he recorded as Goma.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Charton |first=Edouard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIJQAQAAIAAJ |title=Le Tour du monde: nouveau journal des voyages |publisher=Hachette Livre |year=1892 |location=Paris, France |pages=14–16 |language=fr}}</ref><ref> Koen Vlassenroot, Timothy Raeymaekers, ''Conflict and Social Transformation in Eastern DR Congo'', Academia Press, USA, 2004, p. 105 </ref> In 1906, officers of the [[Congo Free State]] established Goma post opposite [[Gisenyi]] as a military outpost to oversee [[Maritime transport|maritime]] activities on [[Lake Kivu]], which later transformed into a civil status office.<ref>{{Cite book |last= |first= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwjqTXt-n2EC |title=Revue des questions scientifiques |publisher=Société scientifique de Bruxelles |year=1914 |location=Brussels, Belgium |pages=336–337 |language=fr}}</ref><ref name=":8">{{Cite web |last=Karumba |first=Janvier Bagula |date=2011 |title=De l'opportunité du développement du tourisme au nord Kivu.

In response, the [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), formed by Tutsi refugees from Uganda, who already held control over significant portions of northern Rwanda after their invasion in 1990 and the ongoing [[Rwandan Civil War|Civil War]], overthrew the Hutu government in [[Kigali]], forcing them out.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Wrong |first=Michela |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S7_pDwAAQBAJ |title=Do Not Disturb: The Story of a Political Murder and an African Regime Gone Bad |date=2021-03-30 |publisher=PublicAffairs |isbn=978-1-61039-843-5 |location=New York City, New York, United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Tilly |first=Charles |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbGtAQAAQBAJ&dq=hutus+were+killed+by+RPF+IN+1994&pg=PT104 |title=The Politics of Collective Violence |date=2003-03-17 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-49480-0 |location=Cambridge, England, United Kingdom}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Bentrovato |first=Denise |date=2015-07-06 |title=Rwanda, Twenty Years On |url=https://journals.openedition.org/etudesafricaines/18095 |journal=Cahiers d'études africaines |language=fr |issue=218 |pages=231–254 |doi=10.4000/etudesafricaines.18095 |issn=0008-0055}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Dizolele |first=Mvemba Phezo |date=2024-02-22 |title=The Dark Side of Rwanda's Rebirth |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/05/29/the-dark-side-of-rwandas-rebirth/ |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=Foreign Policy |publication-place=Washington, D.C., United States}}</ref> Over two million Hutus fled the country to Zaire and many Tutsis and Hutus were internally displaced within Rwanda.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Roper |first=Steven D. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IfhADwAAQBAJ&dq=hutus+were+killed+by+RPF+IN+1994&pg=PT32 |title=Designing Criminal Tribunals: Sovereignty and International Concerns in the Protection of Human Rights |date=2017-11-30 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-351-16010-0 |location=Thames, Oxfordshire United Kingdom}}</ref> Although Hutu extremists were responsible for the mass killing of Tutsis, scholars like Judi Rever and [[Filip Reyntjens]] argue that the main perpetrators of the slaughter were the Tutsi-dominated RPF, led by [[Paul Kagame]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Rever |first=Judi |url=https://www.google.com/books/edition/In_Praise_of_Blood/i9LMDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=In+Praise+of+Blood:+The+Crimes+of+the+Rwandan+Patriotic+Front&printsec=frontcover |title=In Praise of Blood: The Crimes of the Rwandan Patriotic Front |date=18 February 2020 |publisher=[[Random House of Canada]] |isbn=978-0-345-81210-0 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Epstein |first=Helen |date=7 June 2018 |title=The Mass Murder We Don't Talk About |url=https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2018/06/07/rwanda-mass-murder-we-dont-talk-about/ |access-date=24 October 2024 |work=[[The New York Review of Books]] |language=en |publication-place=New York, New York, United States |volume=65 |issue=10 |issn=0028-7504}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=6 June 2018 |title=Debate: Judi Rever will not let anything stand in the way of her quest to document a second Rwandan genocide |url=https://msf-crash.org/en/publications/war-and-humanitarianism/debate-judi-rever-will-not-let-anything-stand-way-her-quest |access-date=24 October 2024 |website=Msf-crash.org |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Reyntjens |first=Filip |date=2004 |title=Rwanda, Ten Years on: From Genocide to Dictatorship |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/3518608 |journal=African Affairs |volume=103 |issue=411 |pages=177–210 |issn=0001-9909}}</ref> According to Judi Rever, Kagame personally commanded massacres at places like [[Byumba]] soccer stadium in northern Rwanda and ordered the pursuit of Hutus in the Zairean forests.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mass Murder at the Byumba Stadium – Hutu Genocide |url=https://www.hutugenocide.org/mass-murder-at-the-byumba-stadium/ |access-date=24 October 2024 |website=Hutugenocide.org |language=en-US}}</ref> They devised ways to dispose of large numbers of bodies by "dissolving them in acid, dumping them in rivers and swamps, or burning them, and established open air crematorium".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kuzmarov |first=Jeremy |date=7 December 2018 |title=Exposing the Crimes of the CIAs Fair-Haired Boy, Paul Kagame, and the Rwandan Patriotic Front |url=https://www.counterpunch.org/2018/12/07/exposing-the-crimes-of-the-cias-fair-haired-boy-paul-kagame-and-the-rwandan-patriotic-front/ |access-date=24 October 2024 |website=CounterPunch.org |language=en-US}}</ref> Various UN missions attempted to establish safe zones and facilitate the movement of refugees.

=== First Congo War ===
{{Further information|First Congo War|Massacres of Hutus during the First Congo War}}

As early as mid-1996, infiltrated units from Rwanda began targeting [[Massacres of Hutus during the First Congo War|Hutu refugee camps]] along the [[Rutshuru]] road, even before formal hostilities began. On the evening of 27 June 1996, an infiltrated group allegedly carried out an attack on the Kibumba refugee camp, resulting in casualties among Hutu refugees, soldiers from the ''Contingent Zaïrois pour la sécurité des camps'' (CZSC), and [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] personnel.<ref name=":10">{{Cite web |date=15 June 2009 |title=Attacks against hutu refugees in camps on the Goma to Rutshuru road (North Kivu) |url=https://www.mapping-report.org/en/attacks-against-hutu-refugees-in-camps-on-the-goma-to-rutshuru-road-north-kivu/ |access-date=15 February 2024 |website=Mapping-report.org |publisher=[[DRC Mapping Exercise Report]] |publication-place=Geneva, Switzerland, New York City, United States}}</ref>

During the [[First Congo War]], from mid-October 1996, Rwandan infiltrations intensified, accompanied by sporadic attacks on refugee camps along the Goma to Rutshuru road by the newly formed [[AFDL|Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Congo]] (AFDL), a rebel movement led by [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]], and [[Rwanda Defence Force|Rwandan Patriotic Army]] (RPA) led by [[Paul Kagame]], who aimed to overthrow [[Mobutu Sese Seko]]'s regime, accusing him of excluding Tutsis from governance and failing to stop the [[génocidaires]].<ref name=":10" /> However, the [[United Nations Security Council]] noted that both the RPA and AFDL pillaged Zaire's minerals for nearly two and a half decades and conducted massacres throughout the conflict.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rever |first=Judi |date=25 September 2023 |title=Rwanda is the 'Wild West' and should be removed from the mineral supply chain |url=https://canadiandimension.com/articles/view/rwanda-is-the-wild-west-and-should-be-removed-from-the-mineral-supply-chain |access-date=24 October 2024 |website=[[Canadian Dimension]] |language=en |publication-place=Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=16 October 2002 |title=Letter dated 15 October 2002 from the Secretary-General addressed to the President of the Security Council |url=https://www.securitycouncilreport.org/atf/cf/%7B65BFCF9B-6D27-4E9C-8CD3-CF6E4FF96FF9%7D/DRC%20S%202002%201146.pdf |access-date=24 October 2024 |website=[[United Nations Security Council]] |publication-place=New York, New York, United States}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=April 2024 |title=Blood Minerals: The laundering of DRC's 3T minerals by Rwanda and private entities |url=https://amsterdamandpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/2024.04.25-AP-DRC-Blood-Minerals.pdf |access-date=24 October 2024 |publisher=Amsterdam & Partners LLP |pages=25–51 |publication-place=London, England, United KIngdom}}</ref> The Kibumba camp, situated twenty-five kilometers north of Goma, was the first to fall under assault. On the night of 25-26 October 1996, AFDL and RPA soldiers bombarded the Kibumba camp, resulting in casualties among Hutu refugees and the destruction of the camp's hospital. Subsequently, approximately 194,000 refugees fled Kibumba towards the Mugunga camp.<ref name=":10" /> The Katale camp also faced attacks on the same night, but [[Forces Armées Zaïroises]] (FAZ)/CZSC soldiers and ex-FAR/[[Interahamwe]] units repelled the assailants initially.<ref name=":10" /> However, on 26 October 1996, AFDL and RPA forces attacked the Katale camp, resulting in numerous Hutu refugee casualties and the death of a Zairian soldier. They also allegedly killed several Hutu refugees using [[Edged and bladed weapons|bladed weapons]]. Following confrontations with FAZ soldiers and ex-FAR/Interahamwe units from the Katale camp, who offered reinforcement, AFDL and RPA forces seized control of the FAZ military camp at [[Rumangabo]].<ref name=":10" />

By 30 October, refugees from Katale and Kahindo camps began to depart, with some heading towards [[Masisi]] via Tongo ''groupement'' of [[Bwito Chiefdom]], while others attempted to reach the Mugunga camp through the [[Virunga National Park]]. However, AFDL and RPA troops had blocked the road to Goma, complicating the refugees' escape routes. On 31 October 1996, AFDL and RPA soldiers allegedly massacred hundreds of Hutu refugees who remained in the Kahindo and Katale camps.<ref name=":10" /> [[:es:Roberto_Garretón|Roberto Garretón]], the [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on the violation of human rights in Zaire, estimated the casualties and highlighted the brutality inflicted on the refugees.<ref name=":10" />

In the aftermath of AFDL/RPA offensives in North Kivu, some refugees opted to return to Rwanda, though their numbers remained small. UNHCR reported approximately 900 Hutu refugees returning to Rwanda between 26 October and 31 October 1996. The reluctance of many refugees to return stemmed from both physical and psychological pressures, including fear of reprisals from AFDL/RPA soldiers.<ref name=":10" /> There were reports of AFDL/RPA soldiers killing refugees who expressed a desire to return to Rwanda.<ref name=":10" /> Determining the exact number of refugees killed by AFDL/RPA soldiers in attacks along the Goma to Rutshuru road was challenging. However, local NGOs involved in burial operations provided insights into the scale of the atrocities. The United Nations Mapping Report Team documented numerous alleged incidents, including mass burials and killings in and around refugee camps between November 1996 and April 1997.<ref name=":10" /> The violence extended beyond the dismantling of refugee camps; Hutu survivors faced persecution while attempting to flee. In November 1996, AFDL/RPA soldiers reportedly targeted Hutu survivors from Kahindo and Katale camps, executing adult males.<ref name=":10" /> These survivors, along with others who resettled in makeshift camps, were subjected to further attacks in the Virunga National Park, resulting in additional casualties.<ref name=":10" /> The atrocities persisted for several months, with killings reported well into 1997. Witness testimonies highlighted the grim reality faced by refugees, with bodies discovered daily in former camp sites.<ref name=":10" /> On 11 April 1997, AFDL/RPA soldiers allegedly massacred hundreds of refugees near Kibumba village. These refugees, intercepted while attempting to return to Rwanda, were detained and subsequently killed by AFDL/RPA forces.<ref name=":10" />

By the end of 1997, AFDL rebels advanced to [[Kinshasa]], driving out Mobutu and leading to Laurent-Désiré Kabila proclaiming himself president on 17 May, renaming the country the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC).<ref name=":12">{{Cite book |last1=Usanov |first1=Artur |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=en5eBAAAQBAJ&dq=second+congo+war+Laurent+Kabila+refuse+to+share+power&pg=PA36 |title=Coltan, Congo and Conflict |last2=Ridder |first2=Marjolein de |last3=Auping |first3=Willem |last4=Lingemann |first4=Stephanie |last5=Espinoza |first5=Luis Tercero |last6=Ericsson |first6=Magnus |last7=Farooki |first7=Masuma |last8=Sievers |first8=Henrike |last9=Liedtke |first9=Maren |date=2013-06-05 |publisher=The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies |isbn=978-94-91040-81-8 |location=Hague, Netherlands |pages=36}}</ref>

Within a year of assuming power, [[Laurent-Désiré Kabila]] found himself in conflict with his former allies, and in 1998, the Rwandan government threw its support behind a Goma-based rebel movement known as the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy|Congolese Rally for Democracy]] (RCD), occasionally denoted as [[Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma|RCD-Goma]].<ref name=":11">{{Cite book |last=Scherrer |first=Christian P. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RJLDEAAAQBAJ&dq=Rwanda+supports+RCD+against+Kabila&pg=PA266 |title=Genocide and Crisis in Central Africa: Conflict Roots, Mass Violence, and Regional War |date=2001-11-30 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing USA |isbn=978-0-313-01617-2 |pages=266}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Holmes |first=Georgina |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ShGMDwAAQBAJ |title=Women and War in Rwanda: Gender, Media and the Representation of Genocide |date=2013-10-25 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |isbn=978-0-85772-317-8 |location=London, England, United Kingdom |pages=26}}</ref> The Goma refugee encampments, where Hutu refugees and Interahamwe militants had forged a militia known as the [[Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda|Democratic Force for the Liberation of Rwanda]] (FDLR), morphed into battlegrounds as Rwandan government forces and the RCD clashed with them to assert dominion.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ciment |first=James |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BpGXBwAAQBAJ&dq=Rwanda+supports+RCD+against+Kabila&pg=PA144 |title=Encyclopedia of Conflicts Since World War II |date=2015-03-27 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-47186-8 |location=Thames, Oxfordshire, United Kingdom |pages=144–146}}</ref><ref name=":11" />

On 2 August 1998, General Sylvain Buki announced via ''[[Radio-Télévision nationale congolaise|Radio-Télévision Nationale Congolaise]]'' (RTNC) in Goma that a rebellion had erupted within the [[Air Force of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congolese Armed Forces]] (FAC).<ref name=":13">{{Cite web |date=June 15, 2009 |title=Second Congo War – Attacks on other civilian populations – North Kivu |url=https://www.mapping-report.org/en/second-congo-war-attacks-on-other-civilian-populations-north-kivu/ |access-date=2024-02-15 |website=Mapping-report.org |publisher=United Nations |publication-place=Geneva, Switzerland, New York City, United States}}</ref> The 10th Brigade of the FAC mutinied, leading to the swift capture of Goma by the RCD and Rwandan Patriotic Army (RPA), with minimal resistance. Goma remained beyond the reach of the Kinshasa government's forces for nearly three years, save for [[Barrage (artillery)|sporadic barrage]].<ref name=":13" /> Amidst these conflicts, the RCD's bias towards the local Tutsi community, Rwandan interference in provincial affairs, and the brutality of RCD and RPA troops towards civilians in North Kivu prompted many locals to join [[Mai-Mai|Mayi-Mayi]] armed groups to defend their communities. The Mayi-Mayi militias utilized forested areas and national parks as bases for launching attacks against RCD and RPA forces.<ref name=":13" />

With support from Kinshasa, the Mayi-Mayi and [[Army for the Liberation of Rwanda|ALiR]] intensified ambushes and pillaging against RCD/RPA soldiers and civilian populations. Consequently, RCD/RPA control was limited to certain urban areas. In response, they increased search operations in various regions.<ref name=":13" /> The [[Second Congo War]] was unprecedented in Africa for the loss of civilian life in massacres and atrocities. By 2003, the Rwandan [[Banyamulenge]]-supported insurgent factions wearied of the conflict, and discord surfaced between them and Rwanda.

In 2006, it became a focal point for the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|FARDC]]'s 81st and 83rd Brigades, who remained faithful to Congolese Tutsi military defector [[Laurent Nkunda]], who accused the government of neglecting to assimilate his military faction into the national army and failing to safeguard their interests.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-01-05 |title=Goma: vers le mixage entre FARDC et éléments de Laurent Nkunda |trans-title=Goma: towards the mix between FARDC and elements of Laurent Nkunda |url=https://www.radiookapi.net/sans-categorie/2007/01/05/goma-vers-le-mixage-entre-fardc-et-elements-de-laurent-nkunda |access-date=2024-02-21 |website=Radio Okapi |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2007-01-20 |title=Nord-Kivu : début de mixage des troupes de Nkunda et des FARDC |trans-title=North Kivu: start of mixing of Nkunda and FARDC troops |url=https://www.radiookapi.net/sans-categorie/2007/01/20/nord-kivu-debut-de-mixage-des-troupes-de-nkunda-et-des-fardc |access-date=2024-02-21 |website=Radio Okapi |language=fr |publication-place=Kinshasa, Democratic Republic of the Congo}}</ref> Numerous heinous crimes were committed by Nkunda during his reign of terror.

Between 17–30 April 2023, [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] (MSF) teams treated 674 victims of sexual violence in camps like Bulengo, Lushagala, and Rusayo, with 360 cases reported solely from the latter, a recently established and densely inhabited settlement situated to the west of Goma.<ref name=":23" /> The vast majority of these victims were attacked while venturing outside the displaced sites in search of basic necessities like [[firewood]] and [[sustenance]].<ref name=":23" />

The M23's offensive in early February 2024 around [[Sake, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Sake]], roughly twenty kilometers from Goma, exposed civilians to heavy fighting and forced more displacement towards Goma and previously settled sites or with host families on the Sake-[[Bweremana]] axis towards the province from [[South Kivu]] in the [[Kalehe Territory]].<ref name=":24">{{Cite web |date=2024-03-01 |title=Évaluation Rapide de Crise M23: Rapport 15, Province du Nord Kivu, 1 mars 2024 - Democratic Republic of the Congo |trans-title=M23 Rapid Crisis Assessment: Report 15, North Kivu Province, March 1, 2024 |url=https://reliefweb.int/report/democratic-republic-congo/evaluation-rapide-de-crise-m23-rapport-15-province-du-nord-kivu-1-mars-2024 |access-date=2024-03-02 |website=reliefweb.int |publication-place=New York City, New York, United States}}</ref> This influx of displaced people strains already limited resources and infrastructure, making it increasingly challenging to meet the needs of affected communities.

=== Ongoing neighborhood insecurity ===
Since early 2019, violent crimes such as [[murder]]s, [[Robbery|robberies]], and [[kidnapping]]s have plagued outlying neighborhoods, notably Ndosho and Mugunga in [[Karisimbi (commune)|Karisimbi commune]].<ref name=":22">{{Cite web |last1=Hendriks |first1=Maarten |last2=Büscher |first2=Karen |date=September 2019 |title=Insecurity in Goma: Experiences, actors and responses |url=https://riftvalley.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Insecurity-in-Goma-by-Maarten-Hendriks-and-Karen-Buscher-RVI-Usalama-Project-2019.pdf |access-date=2024-03-02 |website=Riftvalley.net |publisher=Rift Valley Institute |pages=22–27 |publication-place=Nairobi, Kenya}}</ref> Ndosho, known for its bustling [[Marketplace|markets]] and [[brothel]]s, is characterized by high crime rates and [[Ethnic conflict|ethnic heterogeneity]], while Mugunga, predominantly populated by [[Hutu]]s, formerly hosted extensive refugee camps in the aftermath of the [[Rwandan genocide]], alongside sizable IDPs settlements during periods of heightened conflict between the [[National Congress for the Defence of the People|CNDP]] (and subsequently [[M23 rebellion|M23]]) and the [[Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo|FARDC]] from 2008 to 2010 and 2012 to 2013.<ref name=":22" /> Although the camps have been dismantled, the neighborhood is characterized by a high number of former IDPs ([[Hunde people|Hunde]] and Hutu) who settled in Mugunga. Both neighborhoods border [[Virunga National Park]] to the north and the main road to [[Sake, Democratic Republic of the Congo|Sake]] to the south, dividing the [[Goma (commune)|Goma]] and [[Karisimbi (commune)|Karisimbi]] communes, with diurnal activities centered along this road.<ref name=":22" /> A significant number of Mugunga's inhabitants, including [[Brigandage|brigands]] and ''maibobo'' ([[street children]]), gravitate towards Ndosho during daylight hours, lured by its superior commercial prospects. Throughout the day, encounters with insecurity primarily revolve around [[pickpocketing]], [[extortion]] by ''maibobo'', [[gang]]-related [[harassment]], and coercive measures employed by security personnel in Ndosho.<ref name=":22" /> Brigandage and petty crime have evolved into a viable means of subsistence for many and are part of an urban economy of survival and enrichment. Pilfered [[Merchandising|merchandise]] goods are openly sold in the markets, with numerous criminals attaining notoriety within their neighborhoods and certain gang leaders achieving city-wide renown.<ref name=":22" /> During the night, security conditions worsen and become more violent. Most residents return to their homes, while mixed patrols of the [[Congolese National Police|Police Nationale Congolaise]] (PNC) and Police Militaire (PM) units, along with gangs, prowl around the streets. Without [[pedestrian]] [[traffic]] and under the cloak of darkness, it becomes easier for bandits, thieves, and even unscrupulous police and military officers to operate.<ref name=":22" />

==== Medical literature, demographics, and medical treatment ====
Despite substantial media coverage, sexual violence within the DRC remains insufficiently addressed in [[medical literature]]. A study conducted in Goma from 2013 to 2017 revealed that sexual violence disproportionately affected females below 18 years, with an average age of 16.5 years.<ref name=":2" /> Half of the perpetrators were known to the survivors; 12% of survivors tested positive for pregnancy, and 43% received [[emergency contraception]].<ref name=":2" />

In a separate study covering January 2019 to December 2020, [[Karisimbi (commune)|Karisimbi]] municipality in Goma reported 551 cases of sexual violence, while the [[Goma (commune)|Goma]] municipality recorded 149 cases.<ref name=":2" /> The Majengo neighborhood in Karisimbi reported the highest frequency, with 129 cases.<ref name=":2" /> Among the survivors, women aged 20–29 represented 28.6%, with only 15.7% reporting incidents occurring within their homes, and 60.7% of incidents involved the use of weapons.<ref name=":2" /> [[Vaginal trauma|Vaginal assault]] occurred in all cases, and other forms of assault, like touching, occurred in 7.2% of cases. Strangers constituted 64.7% of the perpetrators, and 61.4% of assailants were identified as members of military or police forces.<ref name=":2" /> Among survivors, 8.1% had a [[physical disability]]. Of the 700 survivors, only 16.1% sought [[Doctor's visit|medical consultation]] for [[Genital trauma|genital injuries]], and 0.7% presented with [[Muteness|mutism]].<ref name=":2" /> Approximately 60.6% sought [[Health care|medical care]] within 72 hours, with 8.1% testing positive for [[HIV]].<ref name=":2" /> Of the survivors, 76.3% underwent [[Pregnancy test|pregnancy tests]], 6.4% of which were positive.

===Threat posed by Lake Kivu===
{{Main|Limnic eruption}}

[[Lake Kivu]] is one of three lakes in Africa identified as having huge quantities of dissolved gas held at pressure in its depths. The other two, [[Cameroon]]'s [[Lake Monoun]] and [[Lake Nyos]], experienced [[limnic eruptions]] or "lake overturns", catastrophic releases of suffocating carbon dioxide probably triggered by landslides. Lake Nyos's overturn in 1986 was particularly lethal, killing nearly two thousand people in the area around the lake. Kivu is 2,000 times bigger than Lake Nyos and also contains dissolved methane as an additional hazard – though concentration of carbon dioxide is much lower than in Lake Nyos.<ref name="solidarites">{{cite web |author=Halbwachs |display-authors=etal |date=2002-03-09 |title=Investigations in Lake Kivu(East Central Africa) after the Nyiragongo Eruption of January 2002: Specific study of the impact of the sub-water lava inflow on the lake stability |url=http://www.eawag.ch/research_e/apec/Scripts/Lorke_publication_lake_kivu_2002.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528121843/http://www.eawag.ch/research_e/apec/Scripts/Lorke_publication_lake_kivu_2002.pdf |archive-date=2008-05-28 |access-date=2008-08-17 |publisher=Solidarities}}</ref> Nearly two million people, including the population of Goma, live in the vicinity of Lake Kivu and could be in danger from a limnic eruption triggered by one of the nearby volcanoes and the earthquakes associated with them.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/2001/killerlakes.shtml "Killer Lakes"].

Goma's economy relies mainly on [[agriculture]], with a significant proportion of its population engaged in the trade of [[Agricultural productivity|agricultural products]]. However, due to the instability of the local currency, [[Transaction cost|economic transactions]] often involve foreign currencies.<ref name=":16">{{Cite web |last=Muhindo |first=Yusuf |date=2020 |title=L'elevage des poules pondeuses et son impact sur la vie economique dans la ville de goma de 2018-2020 |trans-title=Raising laying hens and its impact on economic life in the city of Goma from 2018-2020 |url=https://www.memoireonline.com/10/22/13203/m_Lelevage-des-poules-pondeuses-et-son-impact-sur-la-vie-economique-dans-la-ville-de-goma-de-2018-29.html |access-date=2024-02-22 |publisher=Institut Supérieur de Développement Rural de Goma |language=fr |publication-place=Goma, North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Congo}}</ref> Primarily centered on the production of [[raw material]]s, including agriculture, [[fishing]], [[hunting]], and [[fish farming]], these activities typically employ artisanal methods and antiquated production techniques. Agricultural products are primarily sourced from neighboring territories such as [[Masisi Territory|Masisi]] and [[Rutshuru Territory|Rutshuru]], supplemented by the resources of [[Lake Kivu]], which hosts thriving [[fish market]]s along its shores twice a week.<ref name=":16" /> Cultivation primarily focuses on garden crops and selected [[Staple food|staples]] such as [[legume]]s, [[maize]], and [[tuber]]s, leveraging the fertile volcanic soil enriched by [[basalt]]ic substrata. Nevertheless, the dense population necessitates [[economic diversification|diversification]] to ensure [[food security]] and fostering interdependence with neighboring territories and countries for supplementary yields.<ref name=":16" />

The [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]], comprising industrial activities that transform materials, is less developed in Goma but holds potential for growth, given the city's dense population, which provides abundant labor and potentially mitigates production overheads for entrepreneurs.<ref name=":16" /> Notable production units include the MTC (Master Tabac Congo) conglomerate producing premium-grade [[cigarette]]s, [[coffee]] processing factories like SOTRAKI and ONC, [[Pâtisserie|''pâtisseries'']] exemplified by Au Bon Pain and Boulangerie Mont Carmel, bottling facilities for [[Drinking water|potable water]], and [[Photography|photographic]] [[atelier]]s typified by Fujicolor.<ref name=":16" />

The [[Tertiary sector of the economy|tertiary sector]] dominates Goma's economy, encompassing a broad spectrum of service-based activities such as public administration, commerce, education, healthcare, and law enforcement. The [[Financial services|financial sector]] plays a pivotal role, with [[bank]]ing and [[Non-bank financial institution|non-banking]] [[financial institution]]s serving the city's population.<ref name=":16" /> Banking institutions like [[Central Bank of the Congo|BCC]] (''Banque Centrale du Congo''), BPC (''Banque Privée du Congo''), BCD (''Banque Commerciale et de Développement''), and others provide [[financial services]], while non-banking entities inclusive of [[microfinance]] institutions and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] fortified with credit components cater to various fiscal needs within the city.<ref name=":16" />

Microfinance institutions, including SOMIF/NFT, IMF Hekima, and PAIDEK, contribute to financial inclusion and support [[economic development]] initiatives. NGOs such as the Congolese Initiative for Autonomous Management of Populations and the Association of Support for Grassroots Initiatives provide credit and assistance to entrepreneurs and small businesses.<ref name=":16" /> The city is also home to quasi-public non-bank financial institutions exemplified by SONAS (national insurance company) and INSS (''Institution Nationale de Sécurité Sociale'').<ref name=":16" />

Goma benefits from support organizations like [[United Nations Development Programme|UNDP]], APIBA, UWEKI, and CAFED, which foster [[entrepreneurship]], provide training, and facilitate access to resources for local businesses. These entities, alongside public enterprises like SONAS and INSS promote economic growth and sustainability in Goma.<ref name=":16" />

=== Air ===
[[Aviation]] is a significant transport mode linking Goma with [[Domestic flight|domestic]] and [[International flight|international]] destinations. [[Goma International Airport]], which serves as the city's principal gateway, handles passenger and cargo traffic and facilitates two international routes to [[Entebbe]] and [[Nairobi]], serviced by [[Ethiopian Airlines]] and [[Jambojet]].<ref name=":17">{{Cite web |last=Kwiraviwe |first=Jonas Muhindo |title=Chapitre I: Descripion de la ville de Goma |trans-title=Chapter I: Description of the city of Goma |url=https://www.africmemoire.com/part.3-chapitre-i-descripion-de-la-ville-de-goma-1055.html |access-date=27 February 2024 |publisher=Institut Supérieur de Développement Rural des Grands Lacs (ISDR-GL) |language=fr |publication-place=Goma, North Kivu, Democratic Republic of the Conbgo}}</ref> However, the aviation industry in Goma has changed over the years with the emergence and departure of various carriers. While enterprises such as Virunga Air, Charter, and [[Sunair]] have ceased operations, stalwart aviation entities like société de Transports et Messageries au Kivu SARL (TMK), alongside [[Wimbi Dira Airways]] and [[Hewa Bora Airways]] persist in operating and rendering their services.<ref name=":17" />

=== Maritime ===
[[Maritime transport]] is also an essential mode of transportation, connecting Goma with nearby cities like [[Bukavu]] in the [[South Kivu|South Kivu Province]]. Boats and ferries operated by companies such as the ''[[Société nationale des chemins de fer du Congo|Société Nationale des Chemins de fer du Congo]]'' (SNCC) and private operators like Rafiki and Ihusi Hotel facilitate the movement of people and [[merchandise]] goods across Lake Kivu.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Karumba |first=Janvier Bagula |date=2011 |title=De l'opportunité du développement du tourisme au nord Kivu.
