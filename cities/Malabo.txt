'''Malabo''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ə|ˈ|l|ɑː|b|oʊ}} {{respell|mə|LAH|boh}}, {{IPA|es|maˈlaβo|lang|Pronunciation_of_Malabo_in_Spanish.ogg}}; formerly {{lang|es|Santa Isabel}} {{IPA|es|ˈsantajsaˈβel||Pronunciation of Santa Isabel in Spanish.ogg}}) is the [[Capital city|capital]] of [[Equatorial Guinea]] and the [[provinces of Equatorial Guinea|province]] of [[Bioko Norte]]. It is located on the north coast of the island of [[Bioko]] ({{langx|bvb|Etulá}}, and as ''Fernando Pó'' by the Europeans). In 2018, the city had a population of approximately 297,000 inhabitants.

[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the official language of the city and of the country as well, but [[Pichinglis]] is used as a language of wider communication across Bioko island, including Malabo.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Equatorial Guinea|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/country/GQ/status|access-date=2020-12-10|website=Ethnologue|language=en}}</ref>

Malabo is the oldest city in Equatorial Guinea. [[Ciudad de la Paz]] is a [[planned community]] under construction in mainland Equatorial Guinea which was designed to replace Malabo as the capital. The institutions of governance of Equatorial Guinea began the process of locating to Ciudad de la Paz in February 2017.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-38911573|title=E Guinea government moves into forest HQ|work=[[BBC News]]|date=8 February 2017}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Moresources|section|date=July 2023}}

===European discovery and Portuguese occupation===
[[File:Isla de Fernando Poo – Vista de la playa y ciudad de Santa Isabel.jpg|thumb|left|upright]]
In 1472, in an attempt to find a new route to [[India]], the Portuguese navigator [[Fernão do Pó]],  encountered the island of Bioko, which he called ''Formosa''.<ref name="Adrian2013">Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 174</ref> Later, the island was named after its discoverer, Fernando Pó. At the beginning of the 16th century, specifically in 1507, the Portuguese Ramos de Esquivel made a first attempt at colonization on the island of Fernando Pó. He established a factory in ''Concepción'' (now [[Riaba]]) and developed plantations of [[sugarcane]].{{cn|date=November 2022}}

With the treaties of San Ildefonso in 1777 and [[Treaty of El Pardo (1778)|El Pardo]] in 1778, during the reign of the Spanish King [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]], the Portuguese gave to the Spanish the islands of Fernando Pó, [[Annobón]], and the right to conduct trade in the mainland, an area of influence of approximately 800&nbsp;000 [[Square kilometre|km<sup>2</sup>]] in Africa, in exchange for the [[Colonia del Sacramento]] in [[Río de la Plata]] and the [[Santa Catarina Island]] off the Brazilian coast (occupied by the Spaniards) during a recent war trying to stop Portuguese expansion in the [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata]]. The area stretched from the [[Niger Delta]] to the mouth of [[Ogooué River]] — in current [[Gabon]] — and included, besides the islands of Fernando Pó and [[Annobón]], the islets of Corisco and Elobeyes. Spain wasn't interested in these lands because already had vast colonies in other parts of the world, Spain lost interest in Spanish Guinea in 1827 and authorized the British to use the island as a base for suppressing the [[Slavery in Africa|slave trade]].{{cn|date=November 2022}}

===British presence===
In 1821, the ''[[Nelly (1798 ship)|Nelly]]'' approached the island of [[Bioko|Fernando Pó]]. He found it abandoned and founded the establishments of ''Melville Bay'' (now [[Riaba]]) and ''San Carlos'' (now [[Luba, Equatorial Guinea|Luba]]). Some years later, another British captain, [[William Fitzwilliam Owen]], decided to colonize the island and in the north of it — on the site of the present capital — erected a base for British ships hunting [[Slavery in Africa|slave traders]]. Thus, on 25 December 1827, ''Port Clarence'' was founded on the ruins of a previous Portuguese settlement.<ref name="Adrian2013" /> The name was chosen in honor of the Duke of Clarence, who later became King [[William IV]]. The [[Bubi people|Bubis]] indigenous to the island called it ''Ripotó'' (place of the foreigners). The population of the capital was increased by the arrival of slaves freed by the British. These [[freedmen]] were settled in Port Clarence before the establishment of [[Sierra Leone]] as a colony for freed slaves. The descendants of these freed slaves remained on the island. They joined other migrants who arrived as free workers from Liberia, Sierra Leone, Ghana, Ivory Coast, Benin, Nigeria and Cameroon, and became the population group called [[Creole peoples|Creole]] or [[Fernandino peoples|fernandinos]], whose language was [[Pichinglis]], a Bantu-English [[Creole language|Creole]] with some Spanish elements.

During the British period, the British consul automatically became the governor of the colony, including Governor [[John Beecroft]], a British [[mulatto]] {{Citation needed|date=July 2022}} who modernized the capital, and whose work was later recognized by Spain with a monument in Punta Fernanda.
[[File:Reymalabo1930.PNG|thumb|160px|right|[[Malabo Lopelo Melaka|Malabo Löpèlo Mëlaka, Malabo I of Bioko]]]]

=== Spanish definitive control and new capital ===
In 1844, when Queen [[Isabella II of Spain]] ruled after the regency of her mother Maria Cristina and [[Baldomero Espartero]], in an attempt to modernize Spain and rescue its heritage, Spain let the UK know its desire to regain control of the colony and thus the island. It took another decade to implement this direct control. The capital already had more dynamic and Protestant religious missions which were very successful. Both factors helped to change the attitude of Spain, in addition to internal reasons already alluded.

Spain again took control of the island in 1855 and the capital, Port Clarence, was renamed ''Santa Isabel'', in honor of Queen [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabella II]].<ref name="Adrian2013" /> The capital of the island of [[Bioko|Fernando Pó]] became the capital of Equatorial Guinea.

Its present name was given to the town in 1973 as part of the campaign of President [[Francisco Macías Nguema]] to replace [[toponymy|place name]]s of European origin with African names, in this case honoring [[Malabo Lopelo Melaka|Malabo Löpèlo Mëlaka]], the last [[Bubi people|Bubi]] king. Malabo, the son of King [[Moka]], surrendered to the Spaniards. His uncle Sas Ebuera, head of the Bubi warriors, claimed to represent legitimate Bubi rule and continued resisting, confronting the Spanish openly in 1898.<ref>
{{cite book|page=58|title=The Human Tradition in Modern Africa|volume= 49|series=Human tradition around the world|author=Dennis D. Cordell|year=2012|editor=Dennis D. Cordell|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield, 2012|isbn=978-0742537323|via=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3WqKbRSk7S8C}}</ref> After the Spanish killed Sas Ebuera, Malabo became the king unopposed, but with no authority. Bubi clans and settlements were slow to accept Spanish sovereignty over the island, and the full conquest and pacification of the island was not achieved until 1912.

===Reign of Terror===
During the so-called ''Reign of Terror'' of Macías Nguema, the dictator suppressed much of the intelligentsia of the country, initiating the process of taking over the positions of the public administration by part of the natives of Mongomo and clan Esangui.{{cn|date=December 2023}}

The infamous [[Black Beach]] prison, also known as ''Blay Beach prison'' (or Playa Negra prison), sits at the mouth of the Cónsul River, beside the black beach and behind the Governor's Palace and barracks. Several people have been jailed there during the 35 years of dictatorship. Among those imprisoned and tortured are many political leaders such as Rafael Upiñalo (Movimiento), Fabián Nsue (UP), Felipe Ondo Obiang (FDR), Martín Puye of [[Movement for the Self-Determination of Bioko Island]] (MAIB) or [[Plácido Micó Abogo]] of the Social Democratic [[Convergence for Social Democracy (Equatorial Guinea)|Convergence for Social Democracy]] (CPDS). A group of mercenaries were jailed at Black Beach for the [[2004 Equatorial Guinea coup d'état attempt|2004 coup d'état attempt]] against President [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]].{{cn|date=December 2023}}

== Geography ==
[[File:Klimadiagramm-Malabo-Aequatorial-Guinea-metrisch-deutsch.png|thumb|250px|right|Climatological diagram of Malabo]]
Malabo is situated in the north of the island of Bioko, at coordinates 3° 45' 7.43" North and 8° 46' 25.32" East. The south of Malabo is limited by the Cónsul River and just across the river, south-west, is the hospital. West of the city, located about 9&nbsp;km from the center of Malabo, is renewed [[Malabo International Airport]]. In the coastal region north of the city are the [[bay]]s and [[cape (geography)|capes]]. The elder is the punta de la Unidad Africana located just behind the [[Malabo Government Building]] and which occupies the entire eastern part of the Bay of Malabo. Another cape of importance is punta Europa located in the west of the city near to the airport.

===Climate===
Malabo features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am''). Malabo receives on average {{convert|1,850|mm|in|0|disp=or}} of rain per year. The city has a pronounced, albeit short, sunnier (but still cloudy) [[dry season]] from December through February. January is normally its driest month with {{convert|29|mm|in|2|disp=or}} of rain falling on average. It also has a very long cloudy [[wet season]] that covers the remaining nine months from March to November. On average, the months hit hardest by the wet season are September and October, which receive {{convert|500|mm|in|0}} of [[rain]] and showers between them.

Daytime temperatures do not vary at all day to day, and vary only a few degrees throughout the entire year. At night, the average low temperature is {{convert|20|to|21|°C|°F|0}} in every month of the year but January to April have a slightly higher diurnal range because it is clearer. Nonetheless, with only 1,020 hours of sunshine per year, Malabo is one of the cloudiest,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/cities-who-receive-the-least-sunshine.html|title=The Cloudiest Cities in the World|date=16 May 2019}}</ref> wettest and most [[thunderstorm|lightning-prone]] capitals of the world, and experiences much [[fog]] and haze even when it is not raining in the driest months.
