Stockholm's location appears in [[Saga|Norse sagas]] as [[Agnafit]], and in [[Heimskringla]] in connection with the legendary king [[Agne]]. [[Birka]], located near Stockholm, was one Sweden's major trade centres during the [[Viking Age]], and its restored remains are one of [[Stockholm County]]'s most-visited sites.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Birka – step back into the Viking Age |url=https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/uppland/birka-viking-heritage-stockholm/ |access-date=28 October 2023 |website=visitsweden.com |language=en |archive-date=28 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231028192117/https://visitsweden.com/where-to-go/middle-sweden/uppland/birka-viking-heritage-stockholm/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The earliest written mention of the name Stockholm dates from 1252, by which time the mines in [[Bergslagen]] made it an important site in the iron trade. The first part of the name ({{lang|sv|stock}}) means log in Swedish, although it may also be connected to an old German word ({{lang|de|Stock}}) meaning [[fortification]]. The second part of the name ({{lang|sv|holm}}) means islet and is thought to refer to the islet [[Helgeandsholmen]] in central Stockholm. According to ''[[Erik's Chronicle]]'' the city is said to have been founded by [[Birger Jarl]] to protect Sweden from sea invasions made by [[Karelia (historical province of Finland)|Karelians]] after the [[Sigtuna|pillage of Sigtuna]] on Lake Mälaren in the summer of 1187.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Carlquist |first1=Erik |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2gIK29dXvMAC |title=The Chronicle of Duke Erik: A Verse Epic from Medieval Sweden |last2=Hogg |first2=Peter C. |last3=Österberg |first3=Eva |date=1 December 2011 |publisher=Nordic Academic Press |isbn=9789185509577 |access-date=19 June 2016 |archive-date=25 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225024706/https://books.google.com/books?id=2gIK29dXvMAC |url-status=live }}</ref>

Stockholm's core, the present Old Town ([[Gamla stan|Gamla Stan]]) was built on the central island next to Helgeandsholmen from the mid-13th century onward. The city originally rose to prominence as a result of the Baltic trade of the [[Hanseatic League]]. Stockholm developed strong economic and cultural linkages with [[Lübeck]], [[Hamburg]], [[Gdańsk]] (Danzig), [[Visby]], [[Tallinn]] (Reval), and [[Riga]] during this time.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.river-cities.net/pages/cities/stockholm |title = Retrieved from |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916050317/http://www.river-cities.net/pages/cities/stockholm |archive-date=16 September 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

The strategic and economic importance of the city made Stockholm an important factor in relations between the [[List of Danish monarchs|Danish Kings]] of the [[Kalmar Union]] and the Swedish national independence movement in the fifteenth century and early sixteenth century. The Danish King [[Christian II of Denmark|Christian II]] was able to enter the city in 1520 and on 8 November of that year, a massacre of opposition figures called the [[Stockholm Bloodbath]] took place and set off further uprisings that eventually led to the breakup of the Kalmar Union with the attainment of Swedish independence. With the accession of [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]] in 1523 and the establishment of royal power, the population of Stockholm began to grow, reaching 10,000 by 1600.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kung Gustav Vasa |url=https://www.kungligaslotten.se/regentlangd/gustav-vasa.html |access-date=28 October 2023 |website=www.kungligaslotten.se |language=sv |archive-date=28 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231028192117/https://www.kungligaslotten.se/regentlangd/gustav-vasa.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The seventeenth century saw Sweden grow into a major European power, reflected in the development of the city of Stockholm. From 1610 to 1680 the population multiplied sixfold. In 1634, Stockholm became the official capital of the Swedish empire. Trading rules were also created that gave Stockholm an essential monopoly over trade between foreign merchants and other Swedish, Baltic and [[Scandinavia]]n territories. In 1697, [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Tre Kronor Castle]] burned down and was replaced eventually by [[Stockholm Palace]]; the time of the [[Swedish Empire]] also saw several architectural modernisations of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Kingdom of Sweden as a great European power in the Baltic region {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/summary/Sweden |access-date=28 October 2023 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en |archive-date=28 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231028192119/https://www.britannica.com/summary/Sweden |url-status=live }}</ref>

The beginning of the Swedish Empire saw a renaissance in the arts and sciences; the new queen, [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Christina]], was a strong supporter of science and culture. [[René Descartes|Réne Descartes]], one of the most prominent European philosophers of his time, died in Stockholm; he had been hosted by the queen for several years prior to his death. Inventors, like [[Christopher Polhem]], moved to the city during the time of the Swedish Empire. Academics also spent much time in Stockholm, like [[Olaus Rudbeck]], rector of the [[Uppsala University]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Christopher Polhem {{!}} Inventor, Automata, Inventions {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christopher-Polhem |access-date=28 October 2023 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en |archive-date=8 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220408074901/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Christopher-Polhem |url-status=live }}</ref>

Throughout Sweden's history, [[Walls of Stockholm|walls]] were created in Stockholm to defend the city from attacks. These defensive walls were modified throughout the 13th to the 16th century. In 1625, the [[Great Stockholm Fire of 1625]] destroyed the southwestern section of [[Stadsholmen]], an island in the centre of Stockholm.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/feature-2674661.html |title=Stadsholmen, Stockholm socken, Stockholms domkyrkoförs., Stockholms Kommun, Stockholm, Sweden |access-date=22 February 2021 |archive-date=31 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210331060635/https://www.mindat.org/feature-2674661.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The amount of destruction led to the beginning of the demolition of the Stockholm walls.

In 1710, a [[Plague (disease)|plague]] [[Great Northern War plague outbreak|killed about 20,000]] (36 percent) of the population.<ref>''[https://books.google.com/books?id=sB7rtxDpeB4C&pg=PA9 Stockholm: A Cultural History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819212801/https://books.google.com/books?id=sB7rtxDpeB4C&pg=PA9&dq&hl=en |date=19 August 2020 }}''.

During the [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the late eighteenth century, the city flourished. The new monarch, [[Gustav III]], proved an able and energetic regnant; his economic policies helped the [[Economy of Sweden|Swedish economy]] develop, and his partially successful [[Russo-Swedish War (1788–1790)|war against Russia]] restored some of Sweden's international reputation. The king was an avid patron of the arts, and scientists and cultural figures flocked to Stockholm on a scale unprecedented since the reign of [[Christina, Queen of Sweden|Queen Christina]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Swedish Enlightenment {{!}} Age of Liberty, Gustav III & Enlightenment Ideas {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/art/Swedish-Enlightenment |access-date=28 October 2023 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en |archive-date=28 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231028192115/https://www.britannica.com/art/Swedish-Enlightenment |url-status=live }}</ref>

During this time, [[Carl Michael Bellman]] and [[Joseph Martin Kraus]] helped develop the city's music, a process further accelerated by the founding of the [[Royal Swedish Opera]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=History - the Royal Swedish Opera |url=https://www.operan.se/en/about-the-opera/our-history/ |access-date=17 October 2023 |website=www.operan.se |language=en-US |archive-date=18 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231018051305/https://www.operan.se/en/about-the-opera/our-history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Various artists and writers became prominent, funded by the king and other cultural patrons like [[Carl Gustaf Tessin]]; the two aforementioned figures laid the base for Sweden's [[Nationalmuseum]] at this time. Science also became prevalent; renowned figures like [[Carl Linnaeus]] and [[Anders Celsius]] spent time in Stockholm, and various research institutes, like the [[Stockholm Observatory]], were founded.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stockholm Observatory |url=http://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stockholm-observatory |access-date=17 October 2023 |website=Atlas Obscura |language=en |archive-date=27 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231027223219/https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stockholm-observatory |url-status=live }}</ref>

The early nineteenth century saw a major economic decline of Stockholm and Sweden as a whole, but by the second half of the nineteenth century, Stockholm had regained its leading economic role. New industries emerged with industrialisation and Stockholm was transformed into an important trade and service centre as well as a key gateway point within Sweden. The population also grew dramatically during this time, mainly through [[immigration]]. At the end of the nineteenth century, less than 40% of the residents were Stockholm-born, with most migrants being from poorer rural Sweden; major settlement began to expand outside the historical city limits. The nineteenth century also saw the establishment of a number of scientific institutes and universities, including the [[Karolinska Institutet]] and [[KTH Royal Institute of Technology]]. The [[General Art and Industrial Exposition of Stockholm (1897)|General Art and Industrial Exposition]] was held in 1897,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stockholm Great Art and Industrial Exhibition of 1897. |url=https://jdpecon.com/expo/wfstockholm1897.html |access-date=28 October 2023 |website=jdpecon.com |archive-date=28 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231028192120/https://jdpecon.com/expo/wfstockholm1897.html |url-status=live }}</ref> drawing international attention. From 1887 to 1953 the [[Old Stockholm telephone tower]] was a landmark; originally built to link phone lines, it became redundant after these were buried, and it was later used for advertising before its demolition in the twentieth century. The early twentieth century also saw the creation of the [[Nobel Prize]]s, some of Stockholm's most renowned institutions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The official website of the Nobel Prize |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/ |access-date=21 October 2023 |website=NobelPrize.org |language=en-US |archive-date=27 April 1999 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990427053453/https://www.nobelprize.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Stockholm became a modern and ethnically diverse city in the latter half of the 20th century. Many historical buildings were torn down during the [[modernism|modernist]] era, including substantial parts of the historical district of [[Klara (Stockholm)|Klara]] (which caused major controversy), and replaced with modern architecture. However, in many other parts of Stockholm (such as in [[Gamla stan]], [[Södermalm]], [[Östermalm]], [[Kungsholmen]] and [[Vasastan, Stockholm|Vasastan]]), many older buildings, blocks and streets built before the modernism and [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]] movements survived this era of demolition. Throughout the century, many industries shifted away from industrial activities into more high-tech and service industry areas, which still dominate the city's economy today.<ref name="eurocompanyformations.com"/>

Stockholm belongs to the [[Temperate deciduous forest]] biome, which means the climate is very similar to that of the far northeastern area of the [[United States]] and coastal [[Nova Scotia]] in [[Canada]]. The average annual temperature is {{convert|7.9|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The average rainfall is {{convert|531|mm|0|abbr=on}} per year. The deciduous forest has four distinct seasons, spring, summer, autumn, and winter. In the autumn the leaves change color.

=== Stockholm Municipality ===
{{Main|Stockholm Municipality}}

Stockholm Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders. The semi-official name for the municipality is ''City of Stockholm'' (''Stockholms stad'' in Swedish).<ref>In official contexts, the municipality of Stockholm calls itself "stad" (or City), as do a small number of other Swedish municipalities, and especially the other two Swedish metropolises: [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malmö]]. However, the term "city" has administratively been discontinued in Sweden. See also [[Stad (Sweden)|city status in Sweden]]</ref> As a municipality, the City of Stockholm is subdivided into district councils, which carry responsibility for primary schools, social, leisure and cultural services within their respective areas. The municipality is usually described in terms of its three main parts: Innerstaden ([[Stockholm City Centre]]), [[Söderort]] (Southern Stockholm) and [[Västerort]] (Western Stockholm). The districts of these parts are:

Although winters are cold, average temperatures generally remain above 0&nbsp;°C for much of the year. Summers are pleasantly warm, and precipitation occurs throughout the year.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Das Klima der Erde {{!}} Effektive Klimaklassifikation (Köppen) |url=http://www.klima-der-erde.de/koeppen.html |access-date=2 July 2019 |website=www.klima-der-erde.de |archive-date=30 June 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190630114319/http://www.klima-der-erde.de/koeppen.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Due to the city's high northerly latitude, the length of the day varies widely from more than 18 hours around midsummer to only around 6 hours in late December. The nights from late May until mid-July are not completely dark even when cloudy. Stockholm has relatively mild weather compared to other locations at a similar latitude, or even farther south. With an average of 1900 hours of sunshine per year, it is also one of the sunniest cities in Northern Europe, receiving more sunshine than Paris, London and a few other major European cities of a more southerly latitude. Because of the [[urban heat island]] effect and the prevailing wind travelling overland rather than sea during summer months, Stockholm has the warmest July months of the Nordic capitals. Stockholm has an annual average snow cover between 75 and 100 days.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.smhi.se/polopoly_fs/1.7936.1490011558!/image/p143.png_gen/derivatives/Original_1256px/image/p143.png |title=Dygn/år|language=sv |access-date=31 October 2018 |archive-date=8 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308175556/https://www.smhi.se/polopoly_fs/1.7936.1490011558!/image/p143.png_gen/derivatives/Original_1256px/image/p143.png |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Daylight ===
Stockholm's location just south of the 60th parallel north means that the number of daylight hours is relatively small during winter&nbsp;– about six hours&nbsp;– while in June and the first half of July, the nights are relatively short, with about 18 hours of daylight. Due to its eastern position within Sweden's respective time zone, sunsets occur as early as 2:46 PM in mid-December. Around the [[summer solstice]] the sun never reaches further below the [[horizon]] than 7.3 degrees.<ref>''Svenska Almanackan'' published on an annual basis since 1906 by Almanacksförlaget (which holds a [[List of Royal Warrant Holders of the Swedish court|Royal warrant]]) in cooperation with Stockholm's Observatory. Valid for latitude 59 degrees and 21 minutes north (and longitude 12 time minutes east of the Swedish time meridian, which is 15 degrees East)</ref> This gives the sky a bright blue colour in summer once the sun has set because it does not get any darker than [[nautical twilight]]. Also, when looking straight up towards the [[zenith]], few stars are visible after the sun has gone down. This is not to be confused with the [[midnight sun]], which occurs north of the [[Arctic Circle]], around 7 degrees farther north.

Its 101 councillors are elected concurrently with [[Elections in Sweden|general elections]], held at the same time as the elections to the [[Riksdag]] and [[County councils of Sweden|county councils]]. The Council convenes twice every month at [[Stockholm City Hall]], and the meetings are open to the public. The matters on which the councillors decide have generally already been drafted and discussed by various boards and committees. Once decisions are referred for practical implementation, the employees of the City administrations and companies take over.<ref name="Governance">{{Cite web |title=City Governance |url=http://international.stockholm.se/governance/ |access-date=23 July 2014 |publisher=Stockholm City |archive-date=26 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726195845/http://international.stockholm.se/governance/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The elected majority has a Mayor and eight Vice Mayors. The Mayor and each majority Vice Mayor is the head of a department, with responsibility for a particular area of operation, such as City Planning. The opposition also has four Vice Mayors, but they hold no executive power. Together the Mayor and the 12 Vice Mayors form the Council of Mayors, and they prepare matters for the City Executive Board. The Mayor holds a special position among the Vice Mayors, chairing both the Council of Mayors and the City Executive Board.<ref name="Governance" />

The City Executive Board ({{langx|sv|[[Kommunstyrelsen]]}}) is elected by the City Council and is equivalent to a [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. The City Executive Board renders an opinion in all matters decided by the council and bears the overall responsibility for follow-up, evaluation and execution of its decisions. The Board is also responsible for financial administration and long-term development. The City Executive Board consists of 13 members, who represent both the majority and the opposition. Its meetings are not open to the public.<ref name="Governance" />

[[Stockholm City Hall]] is one of the city's key landmarks, built in the [[National Romantic style|National Romantic Style]] at the beginning of the twentieth century. Hosting the Nobel Prizes and the government of the city of Stockholm, it is one of Sweden's most important buildings.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Stockholm City Hall – City of Stockholm |url=https://stadshuset.stockholm/en/ |access-date=28 October 2023 |website=stadshuset.stockholm |language=en |archive-date=28 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231028192122/https://stadshuset.stockholm/en/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

As the primary financial centre in Sweden, Stockholm is an influential hub for trade, finance and technology in [[Europe]], and one of Scandinavia's largest financial centres. The Stockholm region is the leading region in Sweden by both GDP and GDP per capita, and is amongst the ten wealthiest regions in the [[European Union]] when measured by the latter.<ref>{{Cite web |date=21 March 2013 |title=Regional GDP per capita in the EU in 2010: eight capital regions in the ten first places |url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/1-21032013-AP/EN/1-21032013-AP-EN.PDF |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403140856/http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/cache/ITY_PUBLIC/1-21032013-AP/EN/1-21032013-AP-EN.PDF |archive-date=3 April 2013 |access-date=20 October 2023 |website=[[Eurostat]]}}</ref>

Many of Sweden's largest companies are headquartered in the city; they are drawn by its central location, skilled workforce and preeminent financial sector. These companies include some of the [[Nordic countries|Nordic region]]'s most valuable corporations, like [[Ericsson]], which is one of the world's largest telecommunications companies, or [[Atlas Copco]], which is one of the world's largest industrial companies; other large companies based in Stockholm include [[Electrolux]], [[H&M]] and [[Securitas AB]].

Research and higher education in the sciences started in Stockholm in the 18th century, with education in medicine and various research institutions such as the [[Stockholm Observatory]]. The medical education was eventually formalised in 1811 as [[Karolinska Institute]]t. [[KTH Royal Institute of Technology]] (''Swedish: Kungliga Tekniska högskolan'') was founded in 1827 and is Scandinavia's largest higher education institute of technology with 13,000 students; it is Sweden's foremost polytechnic, and spearheaded several governmental research projects in the twentieth century. [[Stockholm University]], founded in 1878 with university status granted in 1960, has 52,000 students {{As of|2008|lc=y}}. It also incorporates historical institutions, such as the Observatory, the [[Swedish Museum of Natural History]], as well as the botanical garden ''[[Bergianska trädgården]]''. The [[Stockholm School of Economics]], founded in 1909, is one of the few private institutions of higher education in Sweden, and is generally reckoned one of the most prestigious business schools in the world.

In the [[fine art]]s, educational institutions include the [[Royal College of Music, Stockholm|Royal College of Music]], which has a history going back to the conservatory founded as part of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Music]] in 1771, the [[Royal Institute of Art|Royal University College of Fine Arts]], which has a similar historical association with the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Arts]] and a foundation date of 1735, and the [[Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting]], which is the continuation of the school of the [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]], once attended by renowned actors like [[Greta Garbo]]. Other schools include the design school [[Konstfack]], founded in 1844, the [[University College of Opera]] (founded in 1968 but with older roots), the [[University of Dance and Circus|University College of Dance]], and the ''[[Stockholms Musikpedagogiska Institut]]'' (the University College of Music Education).

The [[Södertörn University]] was founded in 1995 as a multi-disciplinary institution for southern [[Metropolitan Stockholm]], to balance the many institutions located in the northern part of the region. Other institutes of higher education include the [[Military Academy Karlberg]], the world's oldest military academy to remain in its original location, inaugurated in 1792 and housed in [[Karlberg Palace]]; there is also the [[Swedish Defence University]], [[Ersta Sköndal University College]], [[Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences]] and the [[University College Stockholm]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=bishop |title=Universities in Stockholm |url=https://www.studyinstockholm.se/universities/ |access-date=28 October 2023 |website=Study in Stockholm |language=en-US |archive-date=28 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231028192122/https://www.studyinstockholm.se/universities/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The biggest complaints from students of higher education in Stockholm are the lack of student accommodations, the difficulty in finding other accommodations and the high rent.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Emerging housing crisis for students |url=http://www.stockholmnews.com/more.aspx?NID=5690 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429155812/http://www.stockholmnews.com/more.aspx?NID=5690 |archive-date=29 April 2012 |access-date=19 May 2012 |publisher=Stockholmnews.com }}</ref>

The city also hosts several of Sweden's architectural masterpieces; the Stockholm region is home to three [[World Heritage Site]]s – spots judged as invaluable places that belong to all of humanity: The [[Drottningholm Palace]], [[Skogskyrkogården]] (The Woodland Cemetery) and [[Birka]].<ref name="Drottningholm">{{Cite web |title=Drottningholm Palace |url=http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/royalpalaces/drottningholmpalace.4.396160511584257f218000368.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140208204542/http://www.kungahuset.se/royalcourt/royalpalaces/drottningholmpalace.4.396160511584257f218000368.html |archive-date=8 February 2014 |access-date=2 February 2014 |publisher=The [[Royal Court of Sweden]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Three world heritage sites |url=http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/To-Do/Tips/Three-world-heritage-sites/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219115856/http://www.visitstockholm.com/en/To-Do/Tips/Three-world-heritage-sites/ |archive-date=19 February 2014 |access-date=2 February 2014 |publisher=Stockholm Visitors Board}}</ref><ref name="Skogskyrkogården">{{Cite web |title=World Heritage Skogskyrkogården |url=http://www.skogskyrkogarden.se/en/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109040448/http://www.skogskyrkogarden.se/en/ |archive-date=9 January 2014 |access-date=2 February 2014 |publisher=The Stockholm City Museum}}</ref> In 1998, Stockholm was named [[European Capital of Culture]].

=== Literature ===
Since its founding, Stockholm has been home to many authors of worldwide recognition; these include figures like [[August Strindberg]] and [[Astrid Lindgren]], as well as other writers important to the development of Swedish literature, like [[Vilhelm Moberg]] or [[Olof von Dalin]]. Stockholm has an active literary life, as it hosts two of Europe's most important literary institutions: the [[Swedish Academy]] and [[National Library of Sweden]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Swedish Academy |url=https://www.svenskaakademien.se/en |access-date=21 October 2023 |website=www.svenskaakademien.se |archive-date=17 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231017174155/https://www.svenskaakademien.se/en |url-status=live }}</ref>

Literature in Stockholm began during the Viking Age, when numerous runestones were carved in the area due to its importance as a trading hub. However, Sweden's literature at the time was primarily based in [[Götaland]] and [[Uppsala]], as evidenced by the abundance of runestones in these areas and the settings of poems like [[Beowulf]]. The presence of the [[Church of Sweden|Church]] and [[Uppsala University|University]] only served to further strengthen Uppsala's role as Sweden's literary centre throughout Christianisation and the Middle Ages.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Arbuckle |first=Alex |date=7 January 2017 |title=The imposing Viking runestones which dot the Swedish countryside |url=https://mashable.com/feature/runestones-of-sweden |access-date=21 October 2023 |website=Mashable |language=en |archive-date=23 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231023032648/https://mashable.com/feature/runestones-of-sweden |url-status=live }}</ref>

The centralisation of royal power and relative secularism brought in the sixteenth century led to the rise of Stockholm in Sweden's literature; this is due to several factors, including royal patronage in Stockholm and the relative decline of Uppsala University. The Bible was translated into Swedish during the reign of [[Gustav I of Sweden|Gustav Vasa]], and he drew several writers to his court due to his fondness for both music and literature.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gustav Vasa Bible {{!}} religious canon {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gustav-Vasa-Bible |access-date=21 October 2023 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en |archive-date=23 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231023032648/https://www.britannica.com/topic/Gustav-Vasa-Bible |url-status=live }}</ref>

Stockholm's literature first began to flourish in the seventeenth century, with notable writers from the rest of Sweden moving to the city due to the wealth and patronage born from the spoils of the [[Swedish Empire]]. This process of cultural advancement continued into the eighteenth century, where the Gustavian era brought Stockholm's literature to its peak. [[Carl Linnaeus]]'s scientific works were influential literary pieces, with August Strindberg describing Linnaeus as a "poet who happened to become a naturalist". Another notable literary figure from this time is [[Carl Michael Bellman]], with his unique gift for setting his poems to song; he is often considered the father of the Swedish ballad tradition.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 August 2016 |title=Evolution of Swedish Folk Music – Swedish Press |url=https://swedishpress.com/evolution-of-swedish-folk-music/ |access-date=21 October 2023 |language=en-US |archive-date=23 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231023032649/https://swedishpress.com/evolution-of-swedish-folk-music/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The nineteenth and twentieth centuries were also a good time for the literature of Stockholm, with the rise of the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] and [[Literary realism|Realist]] movements, respectively. August Strindberg rose to prominence in the late nineteenth century with several important works; he is still considered one of Sweden's finest writers. Astrid Lindgren, in the twentieth century, was famous for her children's stories, while Vilhelm Moberg's works are often considered national treasures in Sweden.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hem - Astrid Lindgren - Astrid Lindgren |url=https://www.astridlindgren.com/se |access-date=21 October 2023 |website=www.astridlindgren.com |language=sv-SE |archive-date=23 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231023032648/https://www.astridlindgren.com/se |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Vilhelm Moberg {{!}} Novelist, Playwright, Historian {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vilhelm-Moberg |access-date=21 October 2023 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en |archive-date=18 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230918091732/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Vilhelm-Moberg |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Look from Erricson globe, stockholm.png|thumb|View of Stockholm from [[Avicii Arena]]]]

Stockholm's oldest section is Gamla Stan (Old Town), located on the original small islands of the city's earliest settlements and still featuring the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] street layout. Some notable buildings of Gamla Stan are the large [[German Church, Stockholm|German Church]] (''Tyska kyrkan'') and several mansions and palaces: the ''[[Swedish House of Nobility|Riddarhuset]]'' (the House of Nobility), the [[Bonde Palace]], the [[Tessin Palace]] and the [[Axel Oxenstierna palace|Oxenstierna Palace]].

The oldest building in Stockholm is [[Riddarholmen Church]] from the late 13th century. After a fire in 1697 when the original medieval castle was destroyed, [[Stockholm Palace]] was erected in a [[Baroque architecture|baroque]] style. [[Storkyrkan]] Cathedral, the episcopal seat of the Bishop of Stockholm, stands next to the castle. It was founded in the 13th century but is clad in a baroque exterior dating to the 1730-40s.

As early as the 15th century, the city had expanded outside of its original borders. Some pre-industrial, small-scale buildings from this era can still be found in [[Södermalm]]. Norrmalm, now the central part of the shopping district of Stockholm, was originally a separate city but was incorporated in Stockholm (now Old Town) during the early 17th century.

[[File:Stockholms stadsarkiv ritningsarkiv 2015.jpg|thumb|Stockholm's oldest preserved building permit drawing from 1713]]

Stockholm has had a tradition of applying for building permits in order to erect a building from the early 18th century, with the oldest building permit from 1713. The building permit application tradition is still ongoing; as a consequence, it is possible to trace the continuous history of a newly built house three centuries into the past. Today the Stockholm City Building committee is in charge of the building permit process and their 1713–1978 archive is maintained by [[:sv:Stockholms stadsarkiv|Stockholm City Archives]]. All drawings of old buildings from 1713 to 1874 are digitised and available through the Stockholms City Archives' website.

At the age of industrialisation and at the end of the 19th century and Stockholm grew rapidly, with plans and architecture inspired by the large cities of the continent such as [[Berlin]] and [[Vienna]]. Notable works of this time period include public buildings such as the [[Royal Swedish Opera]] and private developments such as the luxury housing developments on [[Strandvägen]].

In the 20th century, a nationalistic push spurred a new architectural style inspired by medieval and renaissance ancestry as well as influences of the [[Art Nouveau|Jugend]]/Art Nouveau style. A key landmark of Stockholm, the Stockholm City Hall, was erected 1911–1923 by architect [[Ragnar Östberg]]. Other notable works of these times are the [[Stockholm Public Library]] by [[Gunnar Asplund]] and the [[World Heritage Site]] [[Skogskyrkogården]] by [[Gunnar Asplund|Asplund]] and celebrated architect [[Sigurd Lewerentz]].<ref name="Skogskyrkogården" />

[[File:Sodertornet at night.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Söder Torn]], an {{convert|86|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-tall}} building in Södermalm]]

In the 1930s modernism characterised the development of the city as it grew. New residential areas sprang up such as the development on [[Gärdet]] while industrial development added to the growth, such as the KF manufacturing industries on Kvarnholmen located in the Nacka Municipality. In the 1950s, suburban development entered a new phase, that had already started in the early 1930s, with the introduction of the [[Stockholm metro]]. The modernist developments of [[Vällingby]] and [[Farsta]] were internationally praised. In the 1960s this suburban development continued but with the aesthetic of the times, the industrialised and mass-produced blocks of flats received considerable criticism.

At the same time that this suburban development was taking place, the most central areas of the inner city were being redesigned, known as ''[[Redevelopment of Norrmalm|Norrmalmsregleringen]]''. [[Sergels Torg]], with its five high-rise office towers was created in the 1960s, followed by the total clearance of large areas to make room for new development projects. The most notable buildings from this period include the ensemble of the [[The House of Culture (Stockholm)|House of Culture]], [[Stockholm City Theatre|City Theatre]] and the [[Sveriges Riksbank|Riksbank]] at Sergels Torg, designed by architect [[Peter Celsing]]. Other celebrated works from the 1960s was [[:sv:S:t Görans gymnasium|S:t Görans Gymnasium]] (originally built as a school for women, the School of House work and Sewing) by [[Léonie Geisendorf|Leonie Geisendorf]].

The municipality appointed an official "board of beauty" called "[[Stockholm Beauty Council|Skönhetsrådet]]" in 1919 to protect and preserve the beauty of the city, still an active part of the city planning, and architecture debate in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |date=17 February 2012 |title=Skönhetsrådet |url=http://www.stockholm.se/skonhetsradet |access-date=19 May 2012 |publisher=Stockholm.se |archive-date=12 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212140456/http://www.stockholm.se/skonhetsradet |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Music ===
As the cultural centre of Sweden, Stockholm hosts much of Sweden's [[Music of Sweden|influential music industry]]; the city hosts a variety of musical institutions and many of Sweden's most popular musicians come from Stockholm. Among these are world famous bands like [[ABBA]], as well as more modern musicians like Tim Bergling, more commonly called [[Avicii]].

Other major sports arenas are [[Strawberry Arena]], the new national football stadium, [[Avicii Arena]] (colloquially called Globen), a multi-sport arena and one of the largest spherical buildings in the world and the nearby indoor arena [[Hovet]].

Besides the 1912 Summer Olympics, Stockholm hosted the [[Equestrian at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics Equestrian Games]] and the [[UEFA Euro 1992]]. The city was also second runner up in the [[Bids for the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympics bids]]. Stockholm hosted the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]]. Stockholm recently bid jointly with [[Åre]] for the [[2026 Winter Olympics]] but lost out to the joint bid of [[Milan]]/[[Cortina d'Ampezzo]], [[Italy]], if awarded it would have been the second city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics after [[Beijing]] and for the [[2026 Winter Paralympics]] and with [[Åre]] it would have also be to host all three winter event including [[Winter Olympic Games]], [[Winter Paralympic Games]] and the [[Special Olympics World Games|Special Olympics World Winter Games]] in which [[Åre]] would have host in 2021 along with [[Östersund]], however Sweden pulled out host the Special Olympic World Winter Games 2021 due to lack of funding instead it moved to [[Kazan]], [[Russia]] and was delayed to 2022. Stockholm first bid for the Winter Olympics for [[2022 Winter Olympics]], but withdrew its bid in 2014 due to financial matters.

Stockholm also hosted all but one of the [[Nordic Games]], a winter [[multi-sport event]] that predated the [[Winter Olympic Games|Winter Olympics]].

In 2015, the Stockholms Kungar [[Rugby league]] club was formed. They are Stockholm's first Rugby league team and will play in Sweden's National Rugby league championship.

=== Air quality ===
Stockholm used to have problematic levels of particulates (PM10) due to studded winter tires, but by the 2010s they were below limits, after street-specific bans.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Luften i Stockholm Årsrapport 2016 |url=http://slb.nu/slb/rapporter/pdf8/slb2017_001.pdf |journal=Rapporter Från SLB-Analys |publisher=SLB-analys, Miljöförvaltningen i Stockholm, Stockholms stad |issn=1400-0806 |access-date=19 November 2017 |archive-date=1 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201044325/http://slb.nu/slb/rapporter/pdf8/slb2017_001.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> Nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel vehicles were a problem in the 2010s, but by 2021 they were again below limits, after electric cars had started to replace diesel-driven ones, and pollution regulations for lorries had tightened.

== Transport ==
{{Main|Transport in Stockholm}}

=== Public transportation ===
[[File:SL C20 Gamla Stan, Stockholm.jpg|thumb|right|A southbound full-length (3 car) [[Bombardier C20|C20 metrotrain]] departing from the [[Gamla stan metro station|Gamla Stan station]]]]
Stockholm has an extensive [[public transport]] system. It consists of the [[Stockholm Metro]] ({{langx|sv|Tunnelbanan}}), which consist of three colour-coded main systems (green, red and blue) with seven lines (10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19); the [[Stockholm commuter rail]] ({{langx|sv|Pendeltåget}}) which runs on the state-owned railroads on six lines (40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 48); four [[Trams in Stockholm|light rail/tramway lines]] ([[Spårväg City|7]], [[Nockebybanan|12]], [[Lidingöbanan|21]], and [[Tvärbanan|22]]); the [[Swedish three foot gauge railways|891 mm]] [[narrow-gauge railway]] [[Roslagsbanan]], on three lines (27, 28, 29) in the northeastern part; the local railway [[Saltsjöbanan]], on two lines (25, 26) in the southeastern part; a large number of bus lines, and the inner-city [[Djurgården ferry]]. The overwhelming majority of the land-based public transport in Stockholm County (save for the airport buses/[[Arlanda Express|airport express trains]] and other few commercially viable bus lines) is organized under the common umbrella of [[Storstockholms Lokaltrafik]] (SL), an {{Lang|sv|[[aktiebolag]]}} wholly owned by [[Stockholm County Council]]. Since the 1990s, the operation and maintenance of the SL public transport services are contracted out to independent companies bidding for contracts, such as [[MTR Corporation|MTR]], which operate the Metro. The archipelago boat traffic is handled by [[Waxholmsbolaget]], which is also wholly owned by the County Council.

[[File:Number 7 tram bound for Sergels Torg in Stockholm Sweden.png|left|thumb|upright=0.9|An [[Bombardier Flexity Classic|A34 tram]] on [[Spårväg City|line 7]] at [[Djurgårdsbron]]]]
SL has a common ticket system in the entire Stockholm County, which allows for easy travel between different modes of transport. The tickets are of two main types, single ticket and [[travel card]]s, both allowing for unlimited travel with SL in the entire Stockholm County for the duration of the ticket validity. On 1 April 2007, a zone system (A, B, C) and price system was introduced. Single tickets were available in forms of cash ticket, individual unit pre-paid tickets, pre-paid ticket slips of 8, SMS-ticket and machine ticket. Cash tickets bought at the point of travel were the most expensive and pre-paid tickets slips of 8 are the cheapest. A single ticket costs SEK&nbsp;32 with the card and SEK&nbsp;45 without and is valid for 75 minutes. The duration of the travel card validity depended on the exact type; they were available from 24 hours up to a year. As of 2018, a 30-day card costs SEK&nbsp;860. Tickets of all these types were available with reduced prices for students and persons under 20 and over 65 years of age. On 9 January 2017, the zone system was removed, and the cost of the tickets was increased.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nya priser 2017 - SL |url=http://sl.se/sv/info/nyheter/nya-priser-2017/?date=true |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319115629/http://sl.se/sv/info/nyheter/nya-priser-2017/?date=true |archive-date=19 March 2017 |access-date=19 March 2017 }}</ref>

==== The City Line Project ====
{{Main|Stockholm City Line}}
With an estimated cost of SEK&nbsp;16.8&nbsp;billion (January 2007 price level), which equals 2.44&nbsp;billion US dollars, the [[Stockholm City Line|City Line]], an environmentally certified project, comprises a {{convert|6|km|abbr=on}}-long commuter train tunnel (in rock and water) beneath Stockholm, with two new stations (Stockholm City and Stockholm Odenplan), and a {{convert|1.4|km|abbr=on}}-long railway bridge at [[Enskede-Årsta|Årsta]]. The City Line was built by the Swedish Transport Administration in co-operation with the City of Stockholm, Stockholm County Council, and Stockholm Transport, SL. As [[Stockholm Central Station]] is overloaded, the purpose of this project was to double the city's track capacity and improve service efficiency. Operations began in July 2017.<ref name="trafikverket1">{{Cite web |title=The Stockholm City Line |url=http://www.trafikverket.se/en/startpage/projects/Railway-construction-projects/The-Stockholm-City-Line/ |access-date=28 July 2017 |publisher=[[Swedish Transport Administration]]  |archive-date=30 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170730015258/http://www.trafikverket.se/en/startpage/projects/Railway-construction-projects/The-Stockholm-City-Line |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Barrow |first=Keith |date=10 July 2017 |title=Stockholm City Line opens |url=http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/commuter-rail/stockholm-city-line-opens.html |magazine=[[International Railway Journal]] |access-date=28 July 2017 |archive-date=28 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170728213510/http://www.railjournal.com/index.php/commuter-rail/stockholm-city-line-opens.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Between [[Riddarholmen]] and Söder Mälarstrand, the City Line runs through a submerged concrete tunnel.<ref name="trafikverket1" /> As a green project, the City Line includes the purification of waste water; noise reduction through sound-attenuating tracks; the use of synthetic diesel, which provides users with clean air; and the recycling of excavated rocks.<ref name="trafikverket1" />

=== Roads ===
[[File:Norra Länken nov 2016.jpg|thumb|[[Norra länken]] (North link) motorway in Stockholm]]
Stockholm is at the junction of the [[International E-road network|European routes]] [[European route E4|E4]], [[European route E18|E18]] and [[European route E20|E20]]. A [[Stockholm Ring Road|half-completed motorway ring road]] exists on the south, west and north sides of the City Centre. The northern section of the ring road, Norra Länken, opened for traffic in 2015 while the final subsea eastern section is being discussed as a future project. A bypass motorway for traffic between Northern and Southern Sweden, [[Förbifart Stockholm]], is being built. The many islands and waterways make extensions of the road system both complicated and expensive, and new motorways are often built as systems of tunnels and bridges.

After the trial period was over, consultative referendums were held in Stockholm Municipality and several other municipalities in Stockholm County. The then-reigning government ([[Persson Cabinet]]) stated that they would only take into consideration the results of the referendum in [[Stockholm Municipality]]. The opposition parties ([[Alliance (Sweden)|Alliance for Sweden]]) stated that if they were to form a cabinet after the [[2006 Swedish general election|general election]]—which was held the same day as the congestion tax referendums—they would take into consideration the referendums held in several of the other municipalities in [[Stockholm County]] as well. The results of the referendums were that the Stockholm Municipality voted for the congestion tax, while the other municipalities voted against it. The opposition parties won the general election and a few days before they formed government ([[Reinfeldt Cabinet]]) they announced that the congestion tax would be reintroduced in Stockholm, but that the revenue would go entirely to road construction in and around Stockholm. During the trial period and according to the agenda of the previous government the revenue went entirely to public transport.

=== Ferries ===
[[File:Viking Grace in Stockholm.jpg|thumb|left|[[MS Viking Grace|''Viking Grace'']], one of many [[cruiseferry|cruiseferries]] on the routes to [[Finland]] and [[Åland]]]]
Stockholm has regular ferry lines to [[Helsinki]] and [[Turku]] in Finland (commonly called "[[Baltic Sea cruiseferries|Finlandsfärjan]]"); [[Mariehamn]], [[Åland]]; [[Tallinn]], Estonia; Riga, Latvia, and to [[Saint Petersburg]] in Russia. The large [[Stockholm archipelago]] is served by the archipelago boats of [[Waxholmsbolaget]] (owned and subsidized by Stockholm County Council). Additionally, there are many for-profit private companies offering tours and regular service in the archipelago.

=== City bikes ===
Between April and October, during the warmer months, it is possible to rent [[Stockholm City Bikes]] by purchasing a bike card online or through retailers.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Traffic and public transport |url=http://international.stockholm.se/Tourism-and-history/Transport1/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621050824/http://international.stockholm.se/Tourism-and-history/Transport1/ |archive-date=21 June 2012 |access-date=19 May 2012 |publisher=international.stockholm.se}}</ref> Cards allow users to rent bikes from any Stockholm City Bikes stand spread across the city and return them in any stand.<ref name="citybikes1">[http://www.citybikes.se/en/User-information-/] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925120557/http://www.citybikes.se/en/User-information-/|date=25 September 2010}}</ref> There are two types of cards: the Season Card (valid from 1 April to 31 October) and the 3-day card.

Although the city bikes are not the only victims of this, [[Motorized scooter|e-scooters]] get similar treatment.
