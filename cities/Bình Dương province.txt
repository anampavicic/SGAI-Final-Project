'''Bình Dương''' is a [[Provinces of Vietnam|province of Vietnam]]. It is located in the [[Southeast (Vietnam)|Southeast]] region of the country and the Southern Key Economic Zone 2, bordering [[Bình Phước|Bình Phước province]] to the north, [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (Sài Gòn) to the south and southwest, [[Tây Ninh province]] to the west, and [[Đồng Nai province]] to the east. The province was created from [[Sông Bé province]] on 1 January 1997.

Bình Dương is considered to be the gateway to Ho Chi Minh City, the economic cultural centre and most populous city of the country. Endowed with convenient geography conditions, Bình Dương has an extremely important road network. Major highways of the country cross Bình Dương such as  [[National Route 13 (Vietnam)|National Roads nos. 13]] and 14, the Ho Chi Minh City Route and the Trans-Asian Highway. Bình Dương is only {{convert|10-15|km|mi}} from [[Tân Sơn Nhất International Airport]] and important ports. All of the advantages create favourable conditions to achieve social and economic development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thaiembassy.org/hochiminh/contents/files/articles-20140913-160844-955909.pdf|title=ัดทาโดย ํ สถานกงสุลใหญณ นครโฮจิมินห กันยายน 2557|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190819071504/http://www.thaiembassy.org:80/hochiminh/contents/files/articles-20140913-160844-955909.pdf |archive-date=19 August 2019 }}</ref>

==Geography==
Bình Dương province is situated on relatively level terrain, and is crossed by the [[Saigon River|Saigon]], [[Đồng Nai river|Đồng Nai]], and [[Bé River|Bé]] rivers. It also has some hills. Bình Dương can be seen from the Lái Thiêu central church. Although Bình Dương is flat, it is higher than Ho Chi Minh City. Across Bình Dương there are many different topographic regions, including low mountainous terrain with slight undulation, flat plains and alluvial valleys. There are some low mountains, including Châu Thới in Dĩ An and Cậu mountain (also called Lấp Vò) in [[Dầu Tiếng District|Dầu Tiếng district]] and some low hills. Natural effects have created many different types of landform including worn areas, accumulative areas (due to the deposition of corrosive materials in the flow) and some areas that are worn, accumulative and depositional at the same time. This is due to rainfall and the flow affecting the ground, with the effects of wind, temperature, climate, the erosion and collapse due to gravity of the geology. The impact took place over millions of years.<ref name="Introduction 2017">{{cite web | title=Natural conditions | website=Introduction | date=31 December 2017 | url=https://eng.binhduong.gov.vn/Lists/GioiThieu/DispForm.aspx?ID=16&InitialTabId=Ribbon.Read | access-date=31 October 2019}}</ref>

===Climate===
Bình Dương's climate, like the climate of the rest of the Southeast region, is hot and rainy, with high humidity. It has a tropical monsoon climate, divided into two distinct dry and wet seasons. The rainy season usually starts in May and lasts until late October. In the early months of the rainy season, there are regular short but heavy showers, while July, August, and September usually have continuous rain, sometimes lasting for 1–2 days. Bình Dương seldom experiences typhoons and is only otherwise affected by local storms. The average annual temperature in Bình Dương is {{convert|26-27|C|F}}, with the highest temperature recorded reaching {{convert|39.3|C|F}}, but the overnight low can fall to {{convert|16-17|C|F}}. In the dry season, the average annual humidity is between 76–80%, with the highest at 86% in September and the lowest at 66% in February. The average rainfall each year is 1,800–2,000&nbsp;mm, but rainfall at Sở Sao crossroads in Bình Dương regularly measures up to 2,113.3&nbsp;mm.<ref name="Introduction 2017" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sonongnghiep.binhduong.gov.vn/Uploads/File/2017/2/22/BC1148-BC-SNN_24-06-2016_ThucHienPCTT2015dennayCuaBinhDuong.pdf.pdf|title=sonongnghiep.binhduong.gov.vn|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031061511/http://sonongnghiep.binhduong.gov.vn/Uploads/File/2017/2/22/BC1148-BC-SNN_24-06-2016_ThucHienPCTT2015dennayCuaBinhDuong.pdf.pdf |archive-date=31 October 2019 }}</ref>

Originally, the area now known as Bình Dương was heavily forested, and was dominated by peoples of the Xtiêng, [[Chơ Ro people|Chơ Ro]], [[Mnong people|Mnong]], and [[Khmer Krom]] ethnic groups. In the 17th century, however, [[Vietnamese people|ethnic Vietnamese]] settlers arrived in the region from the east. Most were peasants, seeking to escape poverty by gaining land of their own. There were also a number of refugees from a war between two feudal houses. In 1698, there were enough people in the area that a prominent Vietnamese general was sent to establish official institutions and enforce law. From that point, Bình Dương developed rapidly, with extensive clearance of forests to make room for crops. The province is now dominated by [[Vietnamese people|ethnic Vietnamese]].

==Administrative divisions==
Bình Dương is subdivided into nine district-level sub-divisions:

* Four districts:
** [[Bàu Bàng District|Bàu Bàng]]
** [[Bắc Tân Uyên District|Bắc Tân Uyên]]
** [[Dầu Tiếng District|Dầu Tiếng]]
** [[Phú Giáo District|Phú Giáo]]
* Five provincial cities:
** [[Thủ Dầu Một]] (capital)
** [[Dĩ An]]
** [[Thuận An]]
** [[Tân Uyên, Bình Dương|Tân Uyên]] 
** [[Bến Cát]]

They are further subdivided into four [[Commune-level town (Vietnam)|commune-level towns]] (or townlets), 42 [[Commune (Vietnam)|communes]], and 45 [[Ward (Vietnam)|wards]].

=== Rail transport ===
Binh Duong province is home to two railway stations along the North-South Railway line: [[Sóng Thần station|Song Than station]] and [[Dĩ An station|Di An station]]. As of June 5, 2019, [[Dĩ An station|Di An station]] has become the main passenger station, replacing Song Than due to its convenient location near residential areas and industrial parks. Consequently, the railway sector has discontinued passenger services at [[Sóng Thần station|Song Than station]].<ref name="Cao 2019">{{cite web |last=Cao |first=Huân |date=June 2, 2019 |title=Bình Dương: Ga Dĩ An chính thức được đón khách thay cho ga Sóng Thần |url=https://laodongtre.laodong.vn/tin-tuc/binh-duong-ga-di-an-chinh-thuc-duoc-don-khach-thay-cho-ga-song-than-736873.ldo |access-date=December 8, 2019 |website=Tin tức mới nhất dành cho công nhân lao động trẻ |language=vi}}</ref> Previously, [[Binh Duong province]] was also served by the Saigon - Loc Ninh railway line, which connected at [[Dĩ An station|Di An station]] and facilitated the transportation of rubber latex from [[Binh Phuoc province]].<ref name="CVD – Conversations on Vietnam Development 2017">{{Cite web |date=July 18, 2017 |title=Hệ lụy từ dự án đường sắt Sài Gòn – Lộc Ninh – CVD |url=https://cvdvn.net/2017/07/18/he-luy-tu-du-an-duong-sat-sai-gon-loc-ninh/ |access-date=December 8, 2019 |website=CVD – Conversations on Vietnam Development |language=la}}</ref>

=== Becamex Tokyu Bus ===  
The Becamex Tokyu Bus is a public transportation service launched as part of a joint venture between Vietnam's Becamex IDC Corporation and Japan's Tokyu Corporation. This bus system operates in the Bình Dương province, primarily serving Bình Dương New City. Since its inception in 2014, the Becamex Tokyu Bus has played a crucial role in providing sustainable, eco-friendly public transport, connecting residential areas, commercial centers, and industrial parks. The bus system is part of the larger urban development plan, reducing traffic congestion and promoting the use of public transport in this rapidly developing region. It also enhances accessibility for both local workers and residents, contributing to Bình Dương’s ongoing economic growth and urbanization.
