'''Asmara''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|s|ˈ|m|ɑː|ɹ|ə}} {{respell|əs|MAHR|ə}}), or '''Asmera''', is the capital and most populous city of [[Eritrea]], in the country's [[Central Region (Eritrea)|Central Region]]. It sits at an elevation of {{convert|2325|m|ft}}, making it the [[List of capital cities by altitude|sixth highest capital in the world by altitude]] and the second highest capital in Africa. The city is located at the tip of an [[escarpment]] that is both the northwestern edge of the [[Eritrean Highlands]] and the [[Great Rift Valley, Ethiopia|Great Rift Valley]] in neighbouring [[Ethiopia]]. In 2017, the city was declared as a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] for its well-preserved [[modernist architecture]].<ref>Mark Byrnes [http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/02/african-citys-unusual-preservation-legacy/1163/ An African City's Unusual Preservation Legacy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312081533/http://www.theatlanticcities.com/neighborhoods/2012/02/african-citys-unusual-preservation-legacy/1163/ |date=12 March 2012 }} 8 February 2012 Atlantic Cities</ref><ref>{{Cite news|title = Eritrea capital Asmera makes World Heritage list|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-40544406|access-date = 8 July 2017|date = 8 July 2017}}</ref> According to local traditions, the city was founded after four separate villages unified to live together peacefully after long periods of conflict. Asmara had long been overshadowed by nearby [[Debarwa]], the residence of the ''[[Ethiopian aristocratic and court titles#Important regional offices|Bahr Negash]]'' or the governor of the coastal province, however it still existed as a major settlement for over half a millennium and enjoyed some importance as it stood on the trade route to [[Massawa]]. Asmara first rose to prominence during the 20th century, when it became capital of [[Italian Eritrea]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.shabait.com/about-eritrea/art-a-sport/11121-arbate-asmara-the-origin-of-the-city- | title=Arbate Asmara: The origin of the city | access-date=14 January 2019 | archive-date=15 July 2019 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190715192204/http://www.shabait.com/about-eritrea/art-a-sport/11121-arbate-asmara-the-origin-of-the-city- | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="auto">{{Cite book|last=Pankhurst |first=Richard |year=1982 |title=History Of Ethiopian Towns |page=73 |publisher=Steiner |isbn=9783515032049 }}</ref> Under Italian rule the city of Asmara experienced rapid urbanization and modernization.

==History==
{{Main|History of Asmara}}
{{For timeline}}
According to Eritrean Tigrinya oral traditional history, there were four clans living in the Asmera area on the Kebessa Plateau: the Gheza Gurtom, the Gheza Shelele, the Gheza Serenser and Gheza Asmae. These villages were frequently attacked by clans from the lowlands, until the women of each clan decided that to preserve peace the four clans must unite. The men accepted, hence the name "Arbate Asmera". Arbate Asmera literally means, in the [[Tigrinya language]], "the four (feminine plural) made them unite".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qi-KQchGks8C&pg=PA82 |title=Eritrea |first=Michael |last=Palin |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] Ltd |location=Chalfont St Peter, United Kingdom|isbn=978-1-84162-171-5|page=82|year=2007 }}</ref>

The first mention of Asmara comes from a Latin itinerary during the reign of Emperor [[Dawit I]] (1382–1411).<ref name="auto"/>

Asmara, a small village in the nineteenth century, started to grow quickly when it was occupied by Italy in 1889.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dadfeatured.blogspot.com/2018/08/italian-asmara.html|title=Dadfeatured: ITALIAN ASMARA|date=6 August 2018}}</ref> Governor [[Ferdinando Martini]] made it the capital city of [[Italian Eritrea]] in 1897.<ref>{{cite book|author=AA.VV.|title=Guida dell'Africa Orientale Italiana|publisher=Consociazione Turistica Italiana|page=199|location=Milano|year=1994|language=it}}</ref>

In the early 20th century, the [[Eritrean Railway]] was built to the coast, passing through the town of [[Ghinda]], under the direction of [[Cavanna family#Early migration and diaspora|Carlo Cavanna]]. In both [[1913 Asmara earthquake|1913]] and [[1915 Asmara earthquake|1915]] the city suffered only slight damage in large earthquakes.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ambraseys|first=Nicolas|author-link=Nicholas Ambraseys|author2=Melville, C.P. |author3=Adams, R.D. |title=The Seismicity of Egypt, Arabia and the Red Sea: A Historical Review|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1994|isbn=0-521-39120-2}}</ref>

A large [[Italian Eritreans|Italian community]] developed the city.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 19</ref> According to the 1939 census, Asmara had a population of 98,000, of whom 53,000 were Italian. Only 75,000 Italians lived in all of Eritrea, thus making the capital city by far their largest centre.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maitacli.it |title=Benvenuto sul sito del Maitacli |access-date=8 July 2011 |language=it|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722041546/http://www.maitacli.it/|archive-date= 22 July 2011 |url-status= live}}</ref> (Compare this to the [[Italian colonization of Libya]], where the settler population, albeit larger, was more dispersed.)

The capital acquired an [[Italian modern and contemporary architecture|Italian architectural look]]. Europeans used Asmara "to experiment with radical new designs".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://washingtontimes.com/article/20070915/ENTERTAINMENT/109150018/1007 |title=Asmara useful for experimenting with radical designs for Europeans |newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] |date=15 September 2007 |access-date=8 December 2010}}</ref> By the late 1930s, Asmara was called ''Piccola Roma'' (Little Rome).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fedoa.unina.it/1881/01/Santoianni_Progettazione_Architettonica.pdf|title=Italian architectural planification of Asmera (in Italian) p. 64-66}}</ref> Journalist [[John Gunther (journalist)|John Gunther]] noted in 1955 that "the Italians built [Asmara] well, like [[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]], with handsome wide streets, ornate public buildings, and even such refinements of civilization as a modern sewage system ...

[[Kingdom of Italy|The Kingdom of Italy]] invested in the industrial development of Asmara (and surrounding areas of Eritrea),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://researchomnia.blogspot.com/2015_04_01_archive.html|title=ITALIAN ERITREA INDUSTRIES|date=9 April 2015}}</ref> but the beginning of [[World War II]] brought this to a halt.

[[UNESCO]] made Asmara a World Heritage Site in July 2017, saying "It is an exceptional example of early modernist urbanism at the beginning of the 20th century and its application in an African context".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mg.co.za/article/2017-07-14-00-asmara-the-capital-of-art-deco/|title=Asmara, the capital of Art Deco|date=14 July 2017}}</ref>

===Federation with Ethiopia===
In 1952, the United Nations resolved to federate the former colony under Ethiopian rule. During the Federation, Asmara was no longer the capital city. The capital was now [[Addis Ababa]], over {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=off}} to the south. In 1961, Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]] ended the "federal" arrangement and declared the territory to be the 14th province of the [[Ethiopian Empire]].<ref name=grolier>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Urban Cultures |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofur0000unse |url-access=registration |publisher=[[Grolier|Grolier Publishing Co.]] |year=2002|isbn=9780717256983 }}</ref> Ethiopia's biggest ally was the United States. The city was home to the [[US Army]]'s [[Kagnew Station]] installation from 1943 until 1977. The [[Eritrean War of Independence]] began in 1961 and ended in 1991, resulting in the independence of Eritrea. Asmara was left relatively undamaged throughout the war, as were the majority of highland regions. After independence, Asmara again became the capital of Eritrea.

==Geography==
The city lies at an elevation of {{convert|2325|m|ft|abbr=off}} [[above sea level]]. It lies on north–south trending highlands known as the [[Eritrean Highlands]], an extension of the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. The temperate central portion, where Asmara lies, is situated on a rocky highland plateau, which separates the western lowlands from the eastern coastal plains. The lands that surround Asmara are very fertile, especially those to the south towards the [[Debub Region]] of Eritrea. The highlands that Asmera is located in fall away to reveal the eastern lowlands, characterized by the searing heat and humidity of the Eritrean salt pans, lapped by the Red Sea. To the west of the plateau stretches a vast semi-arid hilly terrain continuing all the way towards the border with [[Sudan]] through the [[Gash-Barka Region]].

It has year-round moderately warm weather, with recorded temperatures ranging between a minimum of {{convert|&minus;4.5|°C|1|disp=or}} and a maximum of {{convert|31.0|°C|1|disp=or}}. It has an average humidity of 51% and an UV-index of 6.

In contrast, December to February are typically Asmara's driest months, where on average only {{cvt|9.1|mm|in}} of precipitation falls in the three months combined. Due to variable rainfall, Asmara's climate is also characterized by drought.<ref name="7 September 2015">{{cite journal|date=7 September 2015|title=Extracting and analyzing forest and woodland cover change in Eritrea based on Landsat data using supervised classification|journal=The Egyptian Journal of Remote Sensing and Space Science|volume=19|issue=1|pages=37–47|doi=10.1016/j.ejrs.2015.09.002|last1=Ghebrezgabher|first1=Mihretab|doi-access=free}}</ref> Several prolonged droughts in this region have occurred beginning in the 1960s and have recurred each decade since then.<ref name="7 September 2015"/> During periods of drought, temperatures are high and little rainfall occurs. As temperatures in a region increase, the rate of evaporation of water from the soil also increases. These combined processes result in the [[desertification]] of the soil. In order to obtain nutrient rich and moist soil for farming purposes, populations rely on deforestation to make use of the underlying ground.<ref name="7 September 2015"/> The most serious environmental issues Asmara faces are deforestation and desertification. Other issues Asmara faces are soil erosion and [[overgrazing]]. All of these environmental issues produce [[soil degradation]].<ref name="7 September 2015"/>

The city is home to the [[Eritrean National Museum]]. The city is often the starting point of the [[Tour of Eritrea]] cycling competition.

==Architecture==
The city is known for its early 20th-century buildings, including the [[Art Deco]] [[Cinema Impero]] (opened in 1937 and considered by the experts one of the world's finest examples of Art Déco style building<ref>Gianluca Rossi, ''Renzo Martinelli inviato de La Nazione'', 2009.</ref>), Cubist Africa Pension, eclectic Eritrean Orthodox [[Enda Mariam Cathedral, Asmara|Enda Mariam Cathedral]] and former [[Opera House]], the [[futurist architecture|futurist]] [[Fiat Tagliero Building]], the [[neo-Romanesque architecture|neo-Romanesque]] [[Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, Asmara]], and the [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] [[Governor's Palace (Asmara)|Governor's Palace]]. The city is adorned by Italian [[Colonisation|colonial]] [[villa]]s and [[mansions]], one prominent example being the [[World Bank Building, Asmara|World Bank Building]]. Most of central Asmara was built between 1935 and 1941, so the [[Italians]] effectively managed to build almost an entire city in just six years.<ref name="Reviving Asmara">{{cite news   |title=Reviving Asmara    |publisher=[[BBC Radio 3]] |date=19 June 2005  |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio3/sundayfeature/pip/kg9k6/  |access-date=30 August 2006}}</ref> At this time, the dictator [[Benito Mussolini]] had great plans for a second [[Roman Empire]] in Africa. War cut this short, but his injection of funds created the Asmara of today, which supposedly was to be a symbol to the colonial [[fascism]] during that period of time.

The city shows off most early 20th-century architectural styles. Some buildings are [[neo-Romanesque architecture|neo-Romanesque]], such as the Church of Our Lady of the Rosary, some villas are built in a late [[Victorian Architecture|Victorian]] style. Art Deco influences are found throughout the city. Essences of [[Cubism]] can be found on the Africa Pension Building, and on a small collection of buildings. The [[Fiat Tagliero Building]] shows almost the height of futurism, just as it was coming into big fashion in Italy.

Asmara is known to be an exceptionally modern city, not only because of its architecture, but Asmara also had more [[traffic lights]] than [[Rome]] did when the city was being built.<ref name="Reviving Asmara"/> The city incorporates many features of a planned city.

===Restaurants, bars, cafes===
Asmara has wide streets, restaurants, [[piazza]]s (town squares), [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s and [[Coffeehouse|cafes]] while many of the boulevards are lined with palms trees. The [[Italy|Italian]] inspired food and culture is very present and was introduced during [[Italian Eritrea]]. Countless restaurants and cafes, serve high quality [[espresso]], [[cappuccino]]s and [[latte]]s, as well as [[gelato]] parlours and restaurants with [[Italian Eritrean cuisine]].<ref name="youtube.com"/> Common dishes served from the [[Italian Eritrean cuisine]] are 'Pasta al Sugo e Berbere', which means "pasta with tomato sauce and [[berbere]]" (spice), "[[lasagna]]" and "cotoletta alla milanese" (milano cutlet).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldtravelguide.net/guides/africa/eritrea/food-and-drink/ |title=Food and drink in Eritrea |publisher=Worldtravelguide.net |access-date=2020-06-08}}</ref><ref name="youtube.com">{{Citation|last=lorenzopinnavideo|title=Asmara, la più bella città africana|date=7 June 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlR5JBQLDXk| archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211211/OlR5JBQLDXk| archive-date=2021-12-11 | url-status=live|access-date=18 September 2017}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

The Historic Center of Asmara was placed on the [[World Monuments Fund]]'s 2006 Watch List of 100 Most Endangered Sites. The listing was designed to bring more attention to the city to save the center from decay and redevelopment and to promote restoration.

Following CARP (a World Bank initiative on Cultural Heritage), the [[European Union]] Delegation in Asmara has engaged into a Heritage Project pertaining to building's restoration and archive management. Launched in 2010 the EU/Eritrea Cultural Project was expected to be completed in 2014 (Pierre Couté – Edward Denison, Project Design Report, EUD Asmara 2009).
