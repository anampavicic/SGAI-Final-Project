'''Shkodër County''' ({{lang-sq|Qarku i Shkodrës}}) is a [[county]] in northwestern [[Albania]], with the capital in [[Shkodër]]. The county spans {{convert|3562|km²|sqmi}} and had a total population of 154,479 people as of the 2023 census.<ref name="pop23" /> The county borders on the counties of [[Lezhë County|Lezhë]], [[Kukës County|Kukës]] and the country of [[Montenegro]]. The county consists of five [[Municipalities of Albania|municipalities]]: [[Fushë-Arrëz]], [[Malësi e Madhe]], [[Pukë]], [[Shkodër]] and [[Vau i Dejës]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vendime.al/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/137-2014.pdf |title=Law nr. 115/2014 |language=sq |pages=6374–6375|access-date=25 February 2022 }}</ref>

During the [[Bronze Age]], the area was inhabited by various [[Illyrian tribes]] such as the [[Ardiaei]]s and [[Labeatae]]s. [[Illyria]] was annexed by [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] in the second century BC, becoming an integral part of the [[Roman Empire]] and its successor the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Falling under [[Venetian Empire|Venetian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] dominion in the late [[Middle Ages]], the modern nation state of [[Albania]] emerged in 1912 following its independence.

The climate of the county is profoundly affected by the [[Adriatic Sea]] in the west and the [[Albanian Alps]] in the north.<ref name="climate">{{cite web|title=VLERËSIMI STRATEGJIK MJEDISOR P.P.V. BASHKIA SHKODËR|url=http://www.bashkiashkoder.gov.al/web/vsm_per_ppv_shkoder_final_823.pdf|website=bashkiashkoder.gov.al|location=Shkodër|pages=59–64|language=sq}}</ref> It experiences mostly [[mediterranean climate]], while the north enjoys [[continental climate]]. The summers are predominantly hot and dry, the winters relatively mild, and falls and springs mainly unstable, both in terms of precipitation and temperatures.<ref name="climate"/> Heavy rainfall is extremely common in the county and has caused many floodings of the rivers and lakes.<ref name="climate"/>

The county features notable diversity with the landscape ranging from the snow-capped [[Albanian Alps]] in the north to the warm regions of [[Lake Shkodër|Shkodra Lake]] and [[Adriatic Sea]] in the south and southwest. Being a geological continuation of the [[Dinaric Alps]], the Albanian Alps are the highest section and one of the most rugged mountains in [[Europe]]. While the Alps occupy the northern part of the territory, the population is concentrated mostly on the Mbishkodra plain, where the largest city is to be found, the cultural and economic centre of [[Shkodër]]. The mountainous areas of the county is sparsely populated, where the population density falls. The largest lake of [[Southern Europe|Southern]] and [[Southeastern Europe]], the [[Lake Shkodër]] sprawls in the east and is shared with [[Montenegro]].

With more than 150,000 inhabitants, the county is the sixth most populous county in Albania, the second most populous county in the [[Northern Albania|Northern Region]]. The county is ethnically a [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|homogeneous]] county and mostly inhabited by [[Ghegs|Gheg Albanians]]. In addition, [[Balkan Egyptians|Egyptian]]s, [[Montenegrins of Albania|Montenegrin]]s and [[Greeks in Albania|Greek]]s also are present in the ethnic composition of the local population. The country has no [[official religion]] and [[freedom of religion]] is a right defined by the [[Constitution of Albania]], and the most widely professed [[religion]] in the county is [[Roman Catholicism]] and [[Islam]].
