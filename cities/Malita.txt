'''Malita''', officially the '''Municipality of Malita''' ({{lang-ceb|Lungsod sa Malita}}; {{lang-fil|Bayan ng Malita}}),  is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] and capital of the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Davao Occidental]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 118,197 people making it the most populous town in the province.{{PH census|current}}

Malita is known for various cultural arts and heritage of its people and tribes. ''Gaginaway Festival'' is celebrated annually every full moon on the month of November and ''Araw ng Malita'' is celebrated annually on November 17, the day of its establishment's enactment in 1936.

==Etymology==
According to a legend, the name of Malita was derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''maleta'', meaning [[suitcase]]. Don Mariano Peralta, a retired [[Spanish–American War]] veteran, lost his suitcase while crossing a river. His shouts of ''"Maleta, Maleta"'' caught the attention of the locals, who retrieved it and later named the area Malita. Its spelling may be associated with the local pronunciation, wherein the ‘e’ sound is commonly used for the [[vowel]]s ‘i’ and ‘e’.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://malita.gov.ph/community-and-people/|title=Community and People|accessdate=July 27, 2024|website=The Local Government Unit of Malita – Municipality of Malita}}</ref>

==History==
Malita is the first municipality established in what is now [[Davao Occidental]]. However, its existence dates back scores of years before its formal creation as a municipality of the undivided province of [[Davao (province)|Davao]]. The Tagakaulo, Blaan and Manobo communities have been living in the area before the arrival of the Spaniards. In 1887, Pablo Pastells, a [[Jesuits|Jesuit]] missionary, mentioned Malita, along with Malalag and Lais, as areas where a total of almost 7,000 Tagakaulo residents.<ref name="malita history" />

Records show that Malita must have existed long before the passage of the [[Philippine Commission]] Act, the Laws of the [[Moro Province]] that mentioned Malita in Section 1 of Act No. 164 dated December 10, 1904. Through the said Act it is presumed that it existed as a ''[[barrio]]'' of [[Santa Cruz, Davao del Sur|Santa Cruz]] long before the coming of the Americans to [[Davao City|Davao]]. Executive Order No. 64, s. 1936, issued by President [[Manuel L. Quezon]], officially created Malita into a municipality. The change legally took effect on January 1, 1937. It originally consisted of nine barrios: Malita (the municipal seat), Basiauan, Kalian, Lacaron, Lais, Lawa, Lawayon, Talaguton, and Tubalon.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=EO|number=64, s. 1936|title=Organizing the Municipal Districts of Malita and Pantukan, Province of Davao, Into Independent Municipalities Under the Names of Malita and Pantukan, With the Seats of Government in the Barrios of Malita and Pantukan |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1936/11/13/executive-order-no-64-s-1936/ |date=1936-11-13 |website=gov.ph |access-date=5 May 2024}}</ref> Marcelino Maruya, from whom the town of [[Don Marcelino, Davao Occidental|Don Marcelino]] was named after, was the first appointed municipal mayor.

Waves of migrants from the [[Visayas|Visayan]] islands, most of whom hail from [[Cebu]], came on what is now Malita during the American colonial period. They were later followed by immigrants from [[Luzon]]. Even after the destruction brought by [[World War II]] by the belligerents, there are still waves of migrants towards Malita and other parts of then-[[Davao (former province)|Davao province]].

Barrios Batulaki and Caburan seceded from Malita to form the separate town of [[Jose Abad Santos, Davao Occidental|Trinidad (now Jose Abad Santos)]] on August 1, 1948.<ref>https://archive.org/download/PhilippinesCensusofPopulationLGUs19032007/Region%2011%20Davao%20Region%20Philippines%20Census%20of%20Population%201903%20-%202007.xlsx 2011 Census] archive.org</ref> On May 8, 1967, Malita became part of [[Davao del Sur]], when Davao was divided under Republic Act No. 4867.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=4867|url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1967/ra_4867_1967.html|title=An Act Creating the Provinces of Davao del Norte, Davao del Sur and Davao Oriental|publisher=The Lawphil Project|date=May 8, 1967|access-date=July 26, 2024}}</ref> On December 19, 1979, barangays Calian, Kiobog, Lamidan, Lawa, Nueva Villa, and Talagutong were separated from Malita to form the new municipality of [[Don Marcelino]].<ref>{{Cite PH act|chamber=BP|number=47|url=https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/22929|publisher=Supreme Court E-Library|title=An Act Creating the Municipality of Don Marcelino, Province of Davao Del Sur|date=December 19, 1979|accessdate=July 27, 2024}}</ref>  

On October 28, 2013, Malita was ceded to [[Davao Occidental]] and designated as its provincial capital as a result of a [[2013 Davao Occidental creation plebiscite|plebiscite]], in which the majority of voters approved the creation of the new province.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=RA|number=10360|url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra2013/ra_10360_2013.html|title=An Act Creating the Province of Davao Occidental|publisher=The Lawphil Project|date=January 14, 2013|access-date=July 26, 2024}}</ref>

As the town is quite far from other urban centers such as [[Digos]], [[Davao City]] and [[General Santos]], Malita is now developing as an urban center of its own, evident in its population, the biggest amongst the municipalities of Davao Occidental. It is now home to hospitals, colleges, banks and shopping centers. As economic activity in the town continues its rapid growth, Malita will soon become the province's first component city in a few years.
