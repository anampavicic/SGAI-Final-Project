'''Ariana''' ({{langx|ar|أريانة}} ''{{audio|help=no|Ariana.wav|Ariana}}'') is a coastal city in north-eastern [[Tunisia]], part of the agglomeration of [[Tunis]], also called "Grand Tunis". It is located at the north of Tunis city center, around {{coord|36|51|45|N|10|11|44|E}}. It is the capital of [[Ariana Governorate]] and the country's eighth largest city.

== History ==
The city's name seems to date back to the period of the [[Vandal Kingdom]] in pre-Islamic [[North Africa]]: the Vandals, in fact, were of [[Arian faith]]. It could also be a reference to [[Persian people|Persian]] settlers from the Islamic invasion of the Maghreb as Persians refer to themselves as "[[Aryan]]".

The city's origins date back to the [[Zirid dynasty]]. Under the [[Hafsid dynasty|Hafsid]] sultan [[Muhammad I al-Mustansir]], Ariana became the residence of the [[Sephardi Jews]] and Muslim [[Al-Andalus|Andalusians]], who sought refuge in [[Ifriqiya]] in the thirteenth century.

== Geography ==
The city, whose area covers {{formatnum: 18000}} [[hectare]]s, and is the pole of an agglomeration covering seven districts for a population basin of {{formatnum:160000}} inhabitants. It is located in the middle of a vast plain bordered by the beaches of Raoued and [[Gammarth]] as well as the city of Carthage and the hill of [[Sidi Bou Saïd]].

== Economy ==
Ariana owes its fame to its [[Agriculture in Tunisia|agricultural]] development and to its production of [[flower]]s, mainly roses.

The Rose Garden, located in Bir Belhassen Park, covers some 3000m² and is home to {{formatnum: 16000}} rosebushes and cuttings, 90% of which belong to the variety known as the “Ariana rose". This variety was introduced in [[1637]] by the Andalusians. The garden is extended by the Galerie de la Rose which develops the historical, natural and cultural aspects of the flower. A rose festival takes place every year in the spring.

==Climate==
In Ariana, the climate is warm and temperate. In winter there is much more rainfall than in summer. The Köppen-Geiger climate classification is Csa. The average annual temperature in Ariana is {{convert|18.0|°C|1}}. About {{convert|449|mm|2|abbr=on}} of precipitation falls annually.
