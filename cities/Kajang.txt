'''Kajang''' is a town in [[Hulu Langat District]], [[Selangor]], [[Malaysia]], located southeast of [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Kajang, along with much of Hulu Langat District, is governed by the [[Kajang Municipal Council]]. Kajang town is located on the eastern banks of the [[Langat River]]. It is surrounded by [[Cheras, Kuala Lumpur|Cheras]], [[Semenyih]], [[Bangi, Malaysia|Bangi]], [[Putrajaya]] and [[Serdang, Selangor|Serdang]].

According to the 2020 census, the local authority area (which includes Kajang, Cheras, Balakong, Bangi, Semenyih and Pekan Hulu Langat) has a population of 1.05 million people.<ref>{{cite web |title=MyCenDash |url=https://tableau.dosm.gov.my/t/BPPD-BahagianperangkaanpendudukdanDemografi/views/MyCenDash/PAPARANUTAMA?%3Aembed=y&%3AisGuestRedirectFromVizportal=y&%3Aorigin=card_share_link |access-date=1 June 2022}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
The name ''Kajang'' is believed to have originated from the language of [[Temuan people|Temuan tribes]] ([[Orang Asli]]) who populated the [[Langat River|Langat valley]] in the 17th-18th centuries. In [[Temuan language|their language]] ''kajang'' referred to their art of weaving [[screwpine]] or [[pandanus]] leaves, which were prevalent in much of the country. A similar theory stated that settlers from the neighboring domain of [[Sungai Ujong]] ([[Negeri Sembilan]]) once constructed huts (''pondok'') in the area with [[Thatching|thatched]] roof made from folded (''lipat kajang'') screwpine leaves.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kajang kaya warisan sejarah |url=https://www.bharian.com.my/hujung-minggu/kembara/2019/09/612085/kajang-kaya-warisan-sejarah |access-date=27 August 2021 |website=Berita Harian}}</ref>

It is also believed that the name ''kajang'' may have originated from the [[Bugis language|Buginese]] word ''berkajang'', meaning ''camp'' or ''accommodation''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Asal usul nama Kajang |url=https://www.sinarharian.com.my/politik/asal-usul-nama-kajang-1.249007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171120073939/https://www.sinarharian.com.my/politik/asal-usul-nama-kajang-1.249007 |archive-date=20 November 2017 |access-date=27 August 2021 |website=Sinar Harian}}</ref>

== Geography and development ==
Kajang is about 22 km (14 miles), about a half hour's drive, from Kuala Lumpur's central business district, primarily through [[Jalan Cheras]] and the [[Cheras-Kajang Expressway|Grand Saga Expressway]]; both routes are part of the [[Malaysia Federal Route 1]] system. By railway, it is about 40 minutes' ride from [[Muzium Negara MRT station|KL Sentral]] on the MRT [[Kajang line]].

The first planned township built and developed just outside Kajang is [[Bandar Baru Bangi]] which was first developed in 1974 by the Selangor state government. As a ''[[satellite town]]'' to Kajang proper, some government offices including the district land office begin operating out of the township. The Kajang bus and taxi terminal called ''Hentian Kajang'' is also located at the eastern end of the township. <ref>{{cite web |title=Portal Rasmi PDT Hulu Langat Sejarah |url=https://www.selangor.gov.my/hululangat.php/pages/view/126?mid=15 |website=www.selangor.gov.my}}</ref> 

More townships were developed closer to Kajang town in recent years, such as Taman Prima Saujana, Sungai Chua and Taman Kajang Perdana (Kajang Highlands). High-end developments in Kajang include Twin Palms, Sri Banyan, Country Heights, Jade Hills, Saujana Impian, TTDI Grove, Tropicana Heights and Prima Paramount. Areas surrounding these townships are accessible via the [[Kajang Dispersal Link Expressway|SILK Expressway]], [[Kajang-Seremban Expressway]],  [[Cheras-Kajang Expressway|Grand Saga Expressway]] and the [[North–South Expressway Southern Route]].

===Geographical definition===
Some adjacent areas in the neighbouring [[Sepang District|Sepang region]] including Kampung Sungai Merab, Desa Pinggiran Putra and Kampung Dato Abu Bakar Baginda, though rarely regarded as part of Kajang, are included in Kajang's postal code of 43000 due to their proximity to Kajang than to [[Sepang (town)|Sepang town]] itself.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shaharir |first1=Syahrul Sazli |title=Kampung Sungai Merab (1896) |url=https://bangi.pulasan.my/sungai_merab#pembukaan_tanah_rancangan |website=Cebisan Sejarah Bangi |language=ms |date=30 March 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://postcode.my/selangor-kajang-sungai-merab-43000.html |title=Sungai Merab, Kajang - Postcode - 43000 - Malaysia Postcode }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Kampung Dato Abu Bakar Baginda, Kajang - Postcode - 43000 - Malaysia Postcode |url=https://postcode.my/selangor-kajang-kampung-dato-abu-bakar-baginda-43000.html |website=postcode.my}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Desa Pinggiran Putra, Kajang - Postcode - 43000 - Malaysia Postcode |url=https://postcode.my/selangor-kajang-desa-pinggiran-putra-43000.html |website=postcode.my}}</ref>  

The townships in Bandar Seri Putra and Bukit Mahkota, while closer to [[Bangi, Malaysia|Bangi]] Lama (Bangi old town) also use the postal code of Kajang. Bangi Lama, Bandar Seri Putra and Bukit Mahkota are located in Mukim Kajang.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ulu Langat (District, Malaysia) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/malaysia/selangor/admin/1008__ulu_langat/ |website=www.citypopulation.de |language=en}}</ref>

== History ==
Orang Asli tribes had already established settlements in what is now Kajang as early as the 16th century, however the first recorded settlement was found in 1709 by additional Orang Asli settlers who relocated from the [[Klang River|Klang valley]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Info Kajang |url=http://www.mpkj.gov.my/ms/pelawat/info-kajang |website=Kajang Municipal Council |date=4 November 2015 |access-date=27 August 2021}}</ref> Kajang town in its present form was founded in the 1870s, in the aftermath of the [[Klang War]]. In its early days, it was settled by [[Mandailing people|Mandailings]] and [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] people from [[Sumatra]] in the then-[[Dutch East Indies]], followed by [[Chinese people|Chinese]] tin miners.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kajang bukan sekadar ada sate sedap, tapi punyai sejarah menarik untuk dijelajah |url=https://www.mstar.com.my/travel/destinasi/2019/12/21/kajang-heritage |website=MStar |date=21 December 2019 |access-date=27 August 2021}}</ref>

As with other towns in Selangor, Kajang as a modern town owes its rise in particular to [[tin]] mines and plantations which were opened around the 1890s. A famous coffee estates was ''Inch Kenneth Estate'' managed by the Kindersley brothers, who were among the first to plant rubber in the country on a commercial basis.<ref>{{Cite web |title=It's History: Men who sowed the seeds of country's rubber industry |url=https://www.angelfire.com/nh/saint1/centuryclips25.html |access-date=2023-08-30 |website=[[Angelfire]]}}</ref>[[File:Kajang town at night.jpg|thumb|Kajang town in Selangor at night, with Metro Plaza Kajang in the background]]During the [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|Japanese invasion]], Kajang was bombed on 12 January 1942, a day after the [[Battle of Kuala Lumpur|fall of Kuala Lumpur]]. The bombs, meant for the [[Kajang MRT station|railway station]], missed its target, and hit a nearby church instead.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Kajang |date=15 July 2020 |url=https://museumvolunteersjmm.com/2020/07/15/history-of-kajang/ |access-date=4 April 2021}}</ref>

In 1948, a [[Malayan Communist Party|Communist insurgency]] against British forces and their allies across Malaya began, which led to the [[Malayan Emergency]] with fighting soon spreading to Kajang. Guerrilla leader [[Lau Yew]] died in combat just outside Kajang in July 1948; British forces photographed his corpse and printed the image onto leaflets to distribute around Kajang.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Hack |first=Karl |title=The Malayan Emergency: Revolution and Counterinsurgency at the End of Empire |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2022 |location=Cambridge |pages=320}}</ref>

Kajang was granted municipal status on 1 January 1997. Previously it was under the jurisdiction of the Hulu Langat District Council (''Majlis Daerah Hulu Langat'', MDHL). Kajang was the [[county seat|administrative centre]] of the Hulu Langat region until it was relocated to [[Bandar Baru Bangi]] in 1992.<ref>{{cite web |title=SEJARAH PEJABAT DAERAH / TANAH HULU LANGAT |url=https://www.selangor.gov.my/hululangat.php/pages/view/126?mid=15 |access-date=27 August 2021}}</ref>
