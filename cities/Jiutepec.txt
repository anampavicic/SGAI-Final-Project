'''Jiutepec''' is a [[city]] and its surrounding [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Morelos]].

The name ''Jiutepec'' comes from the [[Nahuatl]] name ''Xiutepetl'', which means "the precious stones hill".<ref name="siglo.inafed.gob.mx">{{cite web |url=http://siglo.inafed.gob.mx/enciclopedia/EMM17morelos/municipios/17011a.html |title= |website=siglo.inafed.gob.mx |access-date=Dec 21, 2018 |archive-date=April 7, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407232530/http://siglo.inafed.gob.mx/enciclopedia/EMM17morelos/municipios/17011a.html |url-status=dead }}{{title missing|date=May 2022}}</ref>

The city serves as the municipal seat for the surrounding municipality of the same name. Over recent decades Jiutepec has merged into neighboring [[Cuernavaca]] so that on its northeasterly edges it forms one geographically contiguous urban area with the latter. The Cuernavaca [[metropolitan area]] not only includes these two municipalities, but also [[Temixco]], [[Emiliano Zapata, Morelos|Emiliano Zapata]], [[Xochitepec]], and [[Tepoztlán]] municipalities, for a total population of 1,027,562 (February, 2018 figure also includes [[Huitzilac]] and [[Tlaltizapán]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://coespo.morelos.gob.mx/sites/coespo.morelos.gob.mx/files/PDFs/p_febrero.pdf |title= |website=coespo.morelos.gob.mx |access-date=Dec 21, 2018}}{{title missing|date=May 2022|format=.pdf}}</ref>

According to the 2015 census the city of Jiutepec had a population of 153,704 while the municipality reported 214,137 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/mor/poblacion/|title = Número de habitantes.

==History==
===Prehispanic history===
Nauhuatl-speaking people arrived in the state of Morelos in the 12th and 13th centuries, where they formed large, important domains such as "Xiutépetl."<ref name="morelosturistico">{{Cite web|url=http://www.morelosturistico.com/espanol/pagina/z_124_Jiutepec__Historia.php|title=Jiutepec : Historia}}</ref> In A.D. 1389, Xiutépetl fought a war against Cuauhanauhuac, Tetlama, and Yautepec. In 1425, Aztec emperor Ixcóatl conquered Jiutepec.<ref name="morelos_gob">{{cite web |url=http://morelos.gob.mx/?q=jiutepec |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209172120/http://www2.morelos.gob.mx/?q=jiutepec |archive-date=2014-02-09 |title=Jiutepec {{!}} MORELOS}}</ref>

===Conquest & colonialism===
Jiutepec amassed troops to fight [[Hernán Cortés]] on April 11, 1521, but they were defeated. Cortes rested for two days in Jiutepec before attacking Cuernavaca on April 13. During the colonial period, Jiutepec came under the jurisdiction of the ''Marquesado del Valle de Oaxaca''.<ref name="morelosturistico" /> During the colonial period, four haciendas (San Gaspar, Atlacomulco, Dolores, and San Vicente) and several sugar mills were established. In 1807 there was a rebellion against don Vicente Eguía, and his lands were given to the people of Leyva.<ref name="morelos_gob" />

===Independence & 19th century===
After [[Mexican War of Independence]], upon creation of the State of Mexico, Jiutepec became a municipality in the District of Cuernavaca.<ref name="morelos_gob" /> There were constant conflicts between the haciendas and the peasants over land and water during the 19th century.<ref name="morelosturistico" /> Hacienda San Vincente put so much pressure on the people of Amatitlan that they had to abandon their town; in 1852 the governor of the State of Mexico seized lands from the people of Jietepec to give to the Hacienda of Atlacomulco.<ref name="morelosturistico" />

===Revolution & 20th century===
Inhabitants of Jiutepec were extensively involved in the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910.  In 1914 the Hacienda of Atlacomulco served as headquarters for the Army of Liberation during the Siege of Cuernavaca. ''El Texcal'' was the scene of numerous battles. The town of Jiutepec was burned by federal troops in retaliation on May 8, 1916; 225 revolutionaries were summarily judged and shot by (Carrancist) General Rafael Cepeda (''El Democrata'' May 10, 1916; cited in the book ''Zapata y la Revolución Mexicana''.<ref name="morelosturistico" />

By 1932 land was redistributed in the form of ''ejidos'' (collective farmland). The municipality of Emiliano Zapata broke off Jiutepec on December 15, 1932, and Temixco broke off on March 3, 1933. The town of Progreso was founded in March, 1934, and there is a ''carnaval'' with [[Chinelos]] to celebrate.<ref name="morelosturistico" /> The colonia ''Agrícola Militar de José G. Parres'' was founded by veteran ''Zapatistas'' in the 1930s.<ref name="siglo.inafed.gob.mx"/>

Many people of Jiutepec supported peasant leader Rubén Jaramillo in the 1950s and 1960s, and hundreds from Jiutepec attended his funeral in 1962.

In 1966 the ''Ciudad Industrial del Valle de Cuernavaca'' (CIVAC) was established. This industrial city was in conflict with the traditions of the municipality with little benefit in return, as the federal government decreed that industries established in the city would be exempt from taxes for thirty years. 4,000 hectares were expropriated from communal land in Tejalpa, without resistance based on promises that still have not been completed.<ref name="morelosturistico" />

===21st century===
Jiutepec suffered considerably during the September 19, [[2017 Puebla earthquake]]. Four people died and many buildings, were damaged.<ref>https://www.launion.com.mx/morelos/avances/noticias/113372-reportes-rapidos-despues-del-sismo-de-7-1.html (Dec 17, 2018)</ref>
