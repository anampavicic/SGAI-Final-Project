{{Main|History of Bridgeport, Connecticut}}

Bridgeport was inhabited by the [[Paugussett]] [[Native Americans in the United States|native American]] [[Native American tribes|tribe]] during the start of [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]]. The earliest European communal settlement was in the [[Stratfield Historic District|historical Stratfield district]],<ref>{{cite web |url = http://lhdct.org/district/stratfield-historic-district |title = Stratfield Historic District – Local Historic District and Property Commissions in Connecticut |website = lhdct.org |access-date = May 14, 2018 |archive-date = April 5, 2016 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160405091638/http://lhdct.org/district/stratfield-historic-district |url-status = live }}</ref> along US [[Boston Post Road|Route 1]], known in colonial times as the King's Highway. Close by, [[Mountain Grove Cemetery, Bridgeport|Mount Grove Cemetery]] was laid out on what was a native village that extended past the 1650s.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://bportlibrary.org/hc/south-end/the-golden-hill-paugussett-tribe/ |title = The Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe |website = bportlibrary.org |access-date = May 14, 2018 |archive-date = May 15, 2018 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180515043959/http://bportlibrary.org/hc/south-end/the-golden-hill-paugussett-tribe/ |url-status = live }}</ref> It is also an ancient [[Paugusett]] burial ground.

The burgeoning farming community grew and became a center of trade, shipbuilding, and whaling. The town was incorporated to subsidize the [[Housatonic Railroad]] and rapidly industrialized following the rail line's connection to the [[New York and New Haven Railroad|New York and New Haven]] railroad. The town was given its name because of the need for bridges over the [[Pequonnock River]] that provided a navigable port at the mouth of the river. Manufacturing was the mainstay of the local economy until the 1970s.

=== Colonial history ===

The first documented [[Thirteen Colonies|European]] settlement within the present city limits of Bridgeport took place in 1644, centered at [[Black Rock Harbor]] and along North Avenue between Park and Briarwood Avenues. The place was called '''Pequonnock'''<ref name=EB1911/> ([[Quiripi language|Quiripi]] for "Cleared Land"), after a band of the [[Paugussett]], an Algonquian-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] people who occupied this area. One of their sacred sites was Golden Hill, which overlooked the harbor and was the location of natural springs and their planting fields. (It has since been blasted through for construction of an [[List of Interstate Highways in Connecticut|expressway]].){{sfnp|Waldo|1917a|pp= 14–16}}<ref name=Americana>{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia = The Encyclopedia Americana |title = Bridgeport, Conn. |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=CGIMAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA527 |year = 1918 |publisher = Encyclopedia Americana Corp. |volume = 4 |location = New York |page = 527 |access-date = July 29, 2010 }}</ref> The Golden Hill Indians were granted a [[Indian reservation|reservation]] here by the [[English overseas possessions|Colony]] of [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] in 1639; it lasted until 1802. (One of the tribes acquired land for a small reservation in the late 19th century that was recognized by the state. It is retained in the Town of [[Trumbull, Connecticut|Trumbull]].)

In 1639, [[Roger Ludlow]], deputy governor of the [[Thirteen Colonies|English]] [[Connecticut Colony]] was ordered by the [[Connecticut General Assembly|colony's General Assembly]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] to establish two plantations, one at Cupheg the mouth of the Housatonic River (today Stratford), and one at the harbor at the mouth of the [[Pequonnock River]], today's [[Bridgeport Harbor]]. Ludlow disobeyed orders and instead established a settlement in Unconway (today's [[Fairfield, Connecticut|Fairfield]]), probably due to fears of the large [[Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation|Paugussett]] settlement at Golden Hill, which was a sacred site of theirs, so it is believed that they perhaps instead settled in sparsely populated land surrounding the village.<ref>A History of Connecticut's Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe, Charles W. Brilvitch</ref> In 1659, the general court in Hartford established the official borders of the Paugussett Reservation.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://bportlibrary.org/hc/south-end/the-golden-hill-paugussett-tribe/ | title=The Golden Hill Paugussett Tribe – Bridgeport History Center | access-date=December 15, 2022 | archive-date=November 28, 2022 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221128151032/https://bportlibrary.org/hc/south-end/the-golden-hill-paugussett-tribe/ | url-status=live }}</ref>

Bridgeport's early years were marked by residents' reliance on [[fishing]] and [[farming]]. This was similar to the economy of the Paugussett, who had cultivated [[maize|corn]], beans, and squash; and fished and gathered shellfish from both the river and sound. A village called '''Newfield''' began to develop around the corner of State and Water streets in the 1760s.{{sfnp|Orcutt|1886a|p= 609}} The area officially became known as '''Stratfield''' in 1695<ref name=EB1911/> or 1701, due to its location between the already existing towns of ''Strat''ford and Fair''field''.{{sfnp|Orcutt|1886a|pp= 470–474}} During the [[American Revolution]], Newfield Harbor was a center of [[privateering]].<ref name=Americana/><ref name=EB1911/>

=== 19th century ===

By the time of the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[Connecticut]]'s ratification of the [[Articles of Confederation]] in 1781, many of the local farmers held shares in vessels trading at Newfield Harbor or had begun trading in their own name. Newfield initially expanded around the coasting trade with [[Boston]], [[New York City|New York]], and [[Baltimore]] and the international trade with the [[West Indies]].{{sfnp|Orcutt|1886a|p= 609}}{{sfnp|Waldo|1917a|pp= 222–225}} The commercial activity of the village was clustered around the wharves on the west bank of the Pequonnock, while the churches were erected inland on Broad Street. In 1787, the Fairfield County Court ordered the laying out and widening of what is now State Street and Main Street in downtown Bridgeport, along the Pequannock River then Newfield. It was assumed before the Revolution that this land would grow into a city.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/details/historyofoldtown01orcu/page/584/mode/2up?view=theater | title=A history of the old town of Stratford and the city of Bridgeport, Connecticut | year=1886 }}</ref> {{sfnp|Orcutt|1886a|loc= endpaper}}

The city's first immigrants were Irish Catholics who settled in the [[Sterling Hill Historic District (Bridgeport, Connecticut)|Sterling Hill]] section of the [[The Hollow, Bridgeport|Hollow]]. Having come to the US to escape the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|famine]], they arrived in town during the 1830s to build the railroad. They mostly lived in wooden four to six family [[tenement]]s, often subdivided homes.

In 1842, showman P.T. Barnum spent a night in Bridgeport, and there met [[General Tom Thumb|Charles Stratton]], a local [[Midget|dwarf]]. He soon became part of Barnum's act and a star under the name "[[General Tom Thumb]]". Barnum moved to Bridgeport and built four houses in the city over the course of his life, the first being [[Iranistan]].<ref>{{cite web |url = https://connecticuthistory.org/p-t-barnum-an-entertaining-life/ |title = P.

In 1852, Barnum began an endeavor with [[William H. Noble|William Noble]] to develop the land (inherited by Noble) on the other side of the [[Pequonnock River]], across the river from Bridgeport to be known as "[[East Bridgeport Historic District|East Bridgeport]]" with Washington Park at the center.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://bportlibrary.org/hc/barnum-and-related-items/general-william-henry-noble/ |title = General William Henry Noble – Bridgeport History Center |access-date = July 7, 2022 |archive-date = April 5, 2023 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230405224012/https://bportlibrary.org/hc/barnum-and-related-items/general-william-henry-noble/ |url-status = live }}</ref> The new neighborhood had homes, commerce, and factories, centered around [[East Main Street Historic District (Bridgeport, Connecticut)|East Main Street]]. The neighborhood eventually became the East Side of Bridgeport (occasionally spelled "Eastside").

In 1863, during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], the ''Bridgeport Standard'' ran a series of articles encouraging the creation of a public park in the city. This led wealthy residents [[P. T. Barnum|P.T. Barnum]], [[William H. Noble|William Noble]] and [[Nathaniel Wheeler]] to purchase the land on [[Long Island Sound]] and donating the land to the city in 1864. The land on the shore became [[Seaside Park (Connecticut)|Seaside Park]]. A second park was built near East Main Street, when in 1878, James Beardsley donated more than {{convert|100|acre|ha}} to the city along the [[Pequonnock River|Pequonnock]] River under the condition that the land be "kept the same forever as a public park".

=== Climate ===

[[File:Yellow Mill Bridge Bridgeport jeh.jpg|thumb|Yellow Mill Bridge]]

Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Bridgeport straddles the [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and [[humid continental climate]] (''Dfa'') zones with long, hot summers, and cool to cold winters, with precipitation spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Bridgeport, like the rest of coastal Connecticut, lies in the broad transition zone between the colder continental climates of the northern United States and southern Canada to the north, and the warmer temperate and subtropical climates of the middle and [[south Atlantic states]] to the south.

The warm/hot season in Bridgeport is from mid-April through early November. Late day thundershowers are common in the hottest months (June, July, August, September), despite the mostly sunny skies. The cool/cold season is from late November though mid March. Winter weather is far more variable than summer weather along the Connecticut coast, ranging from sunny days with higher temperatures to cold and blustery conditions with occasional snow. Like much of the Connecticut coast and nearby Long Island, NY, most of the winter precipitation is rain or a mix and rain and wet snow in Bridgeport. Bridgeport averages about {{convert|29|in|cm|round=5}} of snow annually, compared to inland areas like [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] which average {{convert|45-60|in|cm}} of snow annually.

Although infrequent, [[tropical cyclones]] (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the Bridgeport metropolitan area. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (Carol), 1960 (Donna), [[Hurricane Gloria]] in 1985, and [[Hurricane Sandy]] in 2012.

[[File:Monthly Climate Normals (1991-2020) - Bridgeport Area, CT(ThreadEx).svg|thumb|right|Climate chart for Bridgeport]]
Bridgeport lies in [[USDA]] garden [[hardiness zone]] 7a, averaging about 92 days annually with freeze. The coastal location of Bridgeport allows it to be milder than locations well south but inland. For example, the record coldest low temperature at [[Atlanta]] is  -8 F, while the record coldest at Bridgeport is -7 F. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where so-called "subtropical indicator" plants such as [[List of cold hardy palms|cold hardy palms]] and other broadleaf evergreens can successfully be cultivated. As such, Southern Magnolias, [[Needle Palm]]s, [[Windmill palm]], [[Loblolly Pine]]s, and [[Crape Myrtle]]s are grown in private and public gardens. Like much of coastal Connecticut, [[Long Island, NY]], and coastal [[New Jersey]], the growing season is rather long in Bridgeport—averaging 210 days from April{{nbsp}}8 to November{{nbsp}}5 according to the National Weather Service in Bridgeport.

The average monthly temperature ranges from {{convert|31.4|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|75.7|°F|1}} in July. The record low is {{convert|−7|°F|0}}, set on January 22, 1984, while the record high is {{convert|103|°F|0}}, set on July 22 in 1957 and 2011.<ref name = NOAA />

Precipitation averages {{convert|44.9|in|mm|sigfig=3}} annually, and is somewhat evenly distributed throughout the year, with March and April the wettest months. Annual snowfall averages {{convert|33.6|in|cm}}, falling almost entirely from December to March. As is typical of coastal Connecticut, snow cover does not usually last long, with an average of 33 days per winter<!--October to April--> with snow cover of at least {{convert|1|in|cm}}.

Bridgeport was largely bypassed by Fortune 500 companies moving to [[Fairfield County, Connecticut|Fairfield County]] in the second half of the 20th century, due to the city's growing reputation for having a rough industrial character. Thus was also largely bypassed by the skyscraper construction boom of the 70s and 80s, resulting in fewer modern skyscrapers than otheir cities<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/26/arts/architecture-view-a-short-skyscraper-with-a-tall-assignment.html |title=ARCHITECTURE VIEW; A Short Skyscraper With a Tall Assignment |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 26, 1989 |access-date=August 2, 2022 |archive-date=July 29, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220729155434/https://www.nytimes.com/1989/03/26/arts/architecture-view-a-short-skyscraper-with-a-tall-assignment.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The tallest building in Bridgeport is currently the [[Richard Meier]]-designed 16-story, {{convert|248|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Bridgeport Center]], which was completed in 1989 and surpassed the 18-story [[Park City Plaza]], which was completed in 1973.

The city is governed by the mayor-council system. Twenty members of the city council are elected from districts. Each district elects two members. The mayor is elected at-large by the entire city

Bridgeport is notable for having had a [[Socialist Party of America|socialist]] mayor for 24 years, [[Jasper McLevy]], who served from 1933 to 1957.

The city's current mayor, [[Joseph P. Ganim]], is a convicted [[felon]] who was sentenced to nine years in prison after conviction in 2003 of 16 federal counts including [[racketeering]], [[extortion]], [[Conspiracy (law)|conspiracy]], bribery, [[mail fraud]], and filing false [[Tax return (United States)|tax returns]] arising from Ganim's "role in a six-year scheme to shake down city contractors…".<ref>Paul von Zielbauer, [https://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/20/nyregion/bridgeport-mayor-convicted-on-16-charges-of-corruption.html Bridgeport Mayor Convicted On 16 Charges of Corruption], ''New York Times'' (March 20, 2003).</ref><ref name=NYTCR/><ref>{{cite news |author = Everton Bailey Jr. |title = Hartford Mayor Eddie Perez convicted of corruption |url = http://www.csmonitor.com/From-the-news-wires/2010/0618/Hartford-Mayor-Eddie-Perez-convicted-of-corruption |quote = Corruption investigations have brought down several prominent Connecticut politicians within the past decade....

Bridgeport is recognized for its polarizing political culture.

His campaign ran on a theme of providing him with a "second-chance," as he was renowned for his work of escaping the city from bankruptcy and build its economy from a post-industrial standpoint.<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last = Chambers |first = Stefanie |date = 2015 |title = Connecticut: Economics, Politics & Policy in the Constitution State |url = https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3987718471/connecticut-economics-politics-policy-in-the-constitution |journal = The New England Journal of Political Science |volume = 8 |issue = 2 |page = 258 |access-date = March 4, 2020 |archive-date = February 28, 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200228065816/https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3987718471/connecticut-economics-politics-policy-in-the-constitution |url-status = live }}</ref>

In a divisive primary election between him, the city's mayor at the time, Bill Finch, and University of Bridgeport professor and real estate developer, Mary-Jane Foster, Ganim was able to receive the endorsement of the politically volatile Democratic Town Committee, paving the way to his victory for being reelected mayor at the end of year.<ref name=":0" />

Bridgeport's Democratic Town Committee has the authority to nominate and endorse Democratic candidates running for local office, and they have the resources to outperform challenger slates that may compete with them. The chairman is former state representative and local restaurateur, Mario Testa.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |url = http://onlyinbridgeport.com/wordpress/the-plague-of-absentee-ballots-reforming-the-democratic-town-committee/ |title = The Plague Of Absentee Ballots, Reforming The Democratic Town Committee – Only In Bridgeport® |date = August 31, 2017 |language = en-US |access-date = February 20, 2020 |archive-date = February 20, 2020 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20200220154414/http://onlyinbridgeport.com/wordpress/the-plague-of-absentee-ballots-reforming-the-democratic-town-committee/ |url-status = live }}</ref>

Bridgeport votes Democratic at the presidential level. In 1972 [[Richard Nixon]] was the last Republican to win the city; since then Democrats have prevailed, often by comfortable margins, the lone exception being 1984 when [[Walter Mondale]] carried the city by just 76 votes (0.16 percent) over [[Ronald Reagan]].
