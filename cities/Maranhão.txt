'''Maranhão''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|maɾɐˈɲɐ̃w|-|Pt-br Maranhão.ogg}}) is a [[States of Brazil|state]] in [[Brazil]]. Located in the country's [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]], it has a population of about 7 million and an area of {{convert|332,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Clockwise from north, it borders on the [[Atlantic Ocean]] for 2,243&nbsp;km and the states of [[Piauí]], [[Tocantins]] and [[Pará]].  The people of Maranhão have a distinctive accent within the common [[Northeastern Brazil]]ian dialect. Maranhão is described in literary works such as ''[[Canção do exílio|Exile Song]]'' by [[Gonçalves Dias]] and ''Casa de Pensão'' by [[Aluísio Azevedo]].

The [[dune]]s of [[Lençóis Maranhenses National Park|Lençóis]] are an important area of environmental preservation. Also of interest is the state capital of [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]], which is a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site. Another important conservation area is the [[Parnaíba River]] delta, between the states of Maranhão and Piauí, with its [[lagoon]]s, desert dunes and deserted beaches or islands, such as Caju island, which shelters rare birds.

The northern portion of the state is a heavily forested plain traversed by numerous rivers, occupied by the eastern extension of the [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist forests]] of [[Amazon rainforest|Amazonia]]. The [[Tocantins–Araguaia–Maranhão moist forests]] occupy the northwestern portion of the state, extending from the [[Pindaré River]] west into neighboring Pará state. The north-central and northeastern portion of the state, extending eastward into northern Piauí, is home to the [[Maranhão Babaçu forests]], a tropical moist forest ecoregion dominated by the [[Babaçu]] palm. The Babaçu palm produces [[Babassu oil|oil]] which is extracted commercially and used for a variety of purposes including food and beauty products.<ref>[https://www.ma.gov.br/noticias/quebradeiras-de-coco-babacu-do-maranhao-sao-destaque-na-i-feira-nordestina-da-agricultura-familiar-e-economia-solidaria-no-rn Quebradeiras de coco babaçu do Maranhão são destaque na I Feira Nordestina da Agricultura Familiar e Economia Solidária no RN]</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-10-21 |title=The Brazilian women facing violence and sexual harassment on farms |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/brazil-farm-women-violence-sexual-harassment-babassu-coconut-breakers-a9159001.html |access-date=2024-08-20 |website=The Independent |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Puppim de Oliveira |first=José A. |last2=Mukhi |first2=Umesh |last3=Quental |first3=Camilla |last4=de Oliveira Cerqueira Fortes |first4=Paulo Jordão |date=2022 |title=Connecting businesses and biodiversity conservation through community organizing: The case of babassu breaker women in Brazil |url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bse.3134 |journal=Business Strategy and the Environment |language=en |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=2618–2634 |doi=10.1002/bse.3134 |issn=0964-4733|doi-access=free }}</ref>

The southern portion of the state belong to the lower terraces of the great [[Brazilian Highlands]], occupied by the [[Cerrado]] savannas. Several plateau [[escarpment]]s, including the [[Chapada das Mangabeiras]], [[Serra do Tiracambu]], and [[Serra das Alpercatas]], mark the state's northern margin and the outlines of river valleys.

The climate is hot, and the year is divided into a wet and dry season.  Extreme humidity characterizes the wet season. The heat, however, is greatly modified on the coast by the south-east trade winds.

The rivers of the state all flow northward to the Atlantic and a majority have navigable channels. The [[Gurupí River]] forms the northwestern boundary of the state, separating Maranhão from neighboring Pará.  The [[Tocantins River]] forms part the state's southwestern boundary with [[Tocantins]] state. The [[Parnaíba River]] forms the eastern boundary of Maranhão, but it has one large tributary, the Balsas, entirely within the state. Other rivers in the state include the [[Turiassu River|Turiassu]] (or Turiaçu) which runs just east of the Gurupi, emptying into the [[Baía de Turiassu]]; the [[Mearim River|Mearim]], [[Pindaré River|Pindaré]], and [[Grajaú River (Maranhão)|Grajaú]], which empty into the [[Baía de São Marcos]]; and the [[Itapecuru River|Itapecuru]] and [[Munim River|Munim]] which discharge into the [[Baía de São José]]. Like the Amazon, the Mearim has a ''[[pororoca]]'' or [[tidal bore]] in its lower channel, which greatly interferes with navigation.

The western coastline has many small indentations, which are usually masked by islands or shoals. The largest of these are the Baía de Turiassu, facing which is [[São João Island]], and the contiguous bays of São Marcos and São José, between which is the large island of [[São Luís Island|São Luís]]. This indented shoreline is home to the [[Maranhão mangroves]], the tallest mangrove forests in the world. The coastline east of Baía de São José is less indented and characterized by sand dunes, including the stark dune fields of the [[Lençóis Maranhenses National Park]], as well as [[restinga]] forests that form on stabilized dunes.

[[Image:Centro histórico São Luís.jpg|thumb|left|Old [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luís]].]]

The etymology of Maranhão is uncertain; the name probably originates from Portuguese settlers from Maranhão in Avis in the province of Alentejo. The word was first used to refer to the [[Amazon River]], which is today used to refer to the Peruvian part of the river ([[Marañón River|Marañón]]).

The first known European to explore Maranhão was the [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón]] in 1500{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}, but it was granted to [[João de Barros]] in 1534 as a [[Captaincy of Maranhão|Portuguese hereditary captaincy]]. The first European settlement, however, was made by a French trading expedition under [[Jacques Riffault]], of [[Dieppe, Seine-Maritime|Dieppe]],<ref name="FAURE2016">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VSUCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT72 |title=Une Histoire du Brésil |last=Faure |first=Michel |date=25 February 2016 |publisher=edi8 |isbn=978-2-262-06631-4 |page=72 |access-date=29 October 2017}}</ref> in 1594, who lost two of his three vessels in the vicinity of [[São Luís Island]], and left a part of his men on that island when he returned home. Subsequently, Daniel de La Touche, Seigneur de La Rividière was sent to report on the place, and was then commissioned by the French crown to found a colony on the island ([[Equinoctial France]]); this was done in 1612. The French were expelled by the Portuguese in 1615, and the Dutch held the island from 1641 to 1644. In 1621 Ceará, Maranhão and Pará were united and called the "Estado do Maranhao", which was separated from the southern captaincies. Very successful Indian missions were soon begun by the [[Jesuits]], who were temporarily expelled as a result of a civil war in 1684 for their opposition to the enslavement of the Indians. Ceará was subsequently detached, but the [[Maranhão (former state)|State of Maranhão]] remained separate until 1774, when it again became subject to the colonial administration of Brazil.

In the late 18th century, there was a great influx of enslaved peoples into the region, which corresponded to the increased cultivation of [[Brazilian cotton cycle|cotton]]. According to the historian Sven Beckert, the region's cotton exports "doubled between 1770 and 1780, nearly doubled again by 1790, and nearly tripled once more by 1800."<ref>{{cite book |title=Empire of Cotton: A Global History |last=Beckert |first=Sven |publisher=Knopf |year=2014 |location=New York }}</ref>

Maranhão did not join in the Brazilian declaration of independence of 1822, but in the following year the Portuguese were driven out by British sailor and liberator Admiral [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Lord Cochrane]] and it became part of the [[Empire of Brazil]]. For this achievement Lord Cochrane became 1st [[Marques of Maranhão]] and [[Governor]] of [[Maranhão Province]].

São Luís is the Brazilian state capital which most closely resembles a Portuguese city. By the early 20th century São Luís had about 30,000 inhabitants, and contained several convents, charitable institutes, the episcopal palace, a fine Carmelite church, and an ecclesiastical seminary. The historic city center was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1997.

The [[service sector]] is the largest component of [[GDP]] at 70%, followed by the [[industrial sector]] at 19.6%. [[Agriculture]] represents 10.4% of GDP (2015). Maranhão is the fourth-largest economy in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast region]] and the 17th-largest in Brazil.{{Citation needed|date=March 2021}}

Maranhão exports: [[aluminium]] 50%, [[iron]] 23.7%, [[soybean]] 13.1% (2002). Share of the Brazilian economy: 0.9% (2004).<ref>{{cite book |title=List of Brazilian states by GDP |publisher=IBGE |location=Maranhão, Brazil |isbn=85-240-3919-1 |year=2004 |language=pt}}</ref>

Maranhão is also known as the land of the palm trees, as the various species of this tree provide its major source of income. The most important of them, from an economic point of view, is the [[Babassu oil|babassu]].
