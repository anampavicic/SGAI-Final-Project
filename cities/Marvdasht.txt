'''Marvdasht''' ({{langx|fa|مرودشت}}){{efn|Also [[romanize]]d as '''Marv Dasht'''<ref>{{GEOnet3|-3074200}}</ref>}} is a city in the [[Central District (Marvdasht County)|Central District]] of [[Marvdasht County]], [[Fars province|Fars]] province, [[Iran]], serving as capital of both the county and the district.<ref name="Fars Province Structure">{{cite report|title=Approval of the organization and chain of citizenship of the elements and units of the national divisions of Fars province, centered in Shiraz|language=fa|website=lamtakam.com|via=Lam ta Kam|url=https://lamtakam.com/law/council_of_ministers/113032|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231207211349/https://lamtakam.com/law/council_of_ministers/113032|publisher=Ministry of the Interior, Council of Ministers|last=Habibi|first=Hassan|orig-date=Approved 21 June 1369|date=c. 2023|archive-date=7 December 2023|access-date=7 December 2023|id=Notification 82840/T128K}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
Some historians hold that Marvdasht was originally the name of one of the neighborhoods of the ancient city of [[Estakhr]], until gradually the whole area was called Marvdasht. Others have argued that ''marv'' was the name of a plant which grew in the area and the suffix ''dasht'' (meaning [[plain]] in the [[Persian language]]) was added to form a descriptive placename.<ref name="miau">{{cite web | url=http://miau.ac.ir/index.aspx?fkeyid=&siteid=1&pageid=155 | title=About Marvdasht | publisher=Islamic Azad university, Marvdasht branch | access-date=8 April 2020}}</ref>

== History ==
Marvdasht is as ancient as the history of Iran and the [[Persian Empire]]. Its former capital [[Persepolis]] is in the vicinity of the city, and few kilometers farther [[Naqsh-e-Rostam]], [[Naqsh-e Rajab]] and the ruins of the ancient city of [[Estakhr]] are reminiscent of the region's importance in historic times.

Archaeological excavations have shown that civilized people had already been living in the Marvdasht Plains for millennia when [[Darius the Great|Darius]] chose the plains of mount Rahmat for his royal residence.<ref>{{Cite web |title=All Attractions of Marvdasht - IVisitIran.com |url=https://www.ivisitiran.com/en/city/all-tourist-attractions/61/All-Attractions-of-Marvdasht |access-date=2022-12-31 |website=www.ivisitiran.com}}</ref>

The modern city of Marvdasht was constructed in the 20th century. After the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] government built a sugar factory in 1935 (1314 [[Persian calendar]]), the city gradually developed around the factory. More and more people left the nearby villages or abandoned their nomadic life to settle in the developing city.

People from farther areas also migrated to the city. In the years before the [[Islamic Revolution]] Marvdasht became the most important industrial city of Fars province, as other factories such as the petrochemical complex, Azmayesh (producing household appliances and intended to be biggest in the middle east), the Charmineh leather factory, the Fars meat complex and the Dadli biscuit company were constructed. These required a huge workforce, and the population of Marvdasht increased until it became the second most populated city in Fars province.

The fertile lands around the city were cultivated to make Marvdasht into the major center of Iranian agriculture, producing more wheat, maize, tomato, cucumber and other agricultural products than any other region.<ref name="miau"/>
