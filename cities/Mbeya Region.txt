'''Mbeya Region''' (''Mkoa wa Mbeya'' in [[Swahili language|Swahili]]) is one of [[Tanzania]]'s 31 administrative [[Regions of Tanzania|regions]]. The region covers an area of {{cvt|35,954|km2}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://Mbeya.go.tz/|title=Mbeya Region Size}}</ref> The region is comparable in size to the combined land area of the nation state of [[Guinea Bissau]].<ref>{{Convert|36,125|km2|abbr=on}} for Guinea Bissau at {{cite web| url=https://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/countries_by_area.htm|title= Area size comparison| publisher=Nations Online| year=2022| access-date=11 October 2022}}</ref> Mbeya Region is bordered to the east by [[Singida Region]], [[Iringa Region]] and [[Njombe Region]]. The region is bordered to the south by [[Malawi]] and [[Lake Nyasa]]. To the north the region borders southern [[Tabora Region]]. Lastly, Mbeya is bordered to the west by [[Songwe Region]]. The regional capital is the city of [[Mbeya]]. According to the 2022 national census, the region had a population of 2,343,754.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tanzania: Regions and Cities - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/tanzania/cities/ |access-date=2024-02-09 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref>

==Geography==
Mbeya Region is located between latitudes 7 degrees and 9 degrees 31' south of the [[equator]] and between longitudes 32 degrees and 35 degrees east of Greenwich in Tanzania's Southern Highlands Zone. The Republic of Malawi shares borders with the Mbeya Region to the south, Songwe Region to the west, Singida and Tabora Regions to the north, and Iringa and Njombe Regions to the east. Kasumulu in [[Kyela District]] serves as the primary entry and/or exit point into the Republic of Malawi, which is a neighboring country.<ref>{{Cite web |title=TANROADS Official Website :: Projects |url=https://www.tanroads.go.tz/projects/269/one-stop-border-post-kasumulusongwe |access-date=2024-08-27 |website=www.tanroads.go.tz}}</ref>

The [[Great Rift Valley]] created the majority of the places in the area, with the lowland elevation occupying the [[Western Rift Zone of Tanzania|Western Rift Zone]], which includes the Lake Rukwa and Lake Nyasa regions, and the Eastern Rift Zone, which includes the Usangu Plains and other sections of the Ruaha Trough. The heights range from {{convert|475|m}} above sea level at Lake Nyasa to more than {{convert|2900|m}} at [[Mount Rungwe]]'s summit.{{r|MbeyaRC_InvGuide|p=14-15}}

===Hydrology===
The [[Great Ruaha River|Ruaha]]/[[Rufiji River|Rufiji]] Basin in the east, the inland [[Lake Rukwa]] Basin in the north-west, and the Lake Nyasa Basin in the south are the three river basins that make up the Mbeya Region. The [[surface runoff]] pattern and the unimodal rainfall distribution closely match. Tanzania's Southern Plateau's south highlands serve as a watershed for the area's primary drainage system. The [[Great Ruaha River|Great Ruaha]], Zira, Songwe, Kiwira, [[Lufilyo River|Lufilyo]], and Mbaka are some of the major rivers in the area. One of the inlets to the Indian Ocean, the Great Ruaha River is supplied by the Kimani, [[Chimala]], Igurusi, and other tributaries. Rivers Kiwira, [[Lufilyo]], and Mbaka drain south into Lake Nyasa, while rivers Zira and [[Songwe River|Songwe]] form an inland drainage into Lake Rukwa.{{fact|date=October 2022}}

Mbeya's surface area is {{convert|35232.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or about 4 percent of Tanzania's total {{convert|947300|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. The region's entire surface area is made up of {{convert|495.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of water and {{convert|34,736.3|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of dry land. The smallest land areas belong to Mbeya City Council ({{convert|250.2|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}) and Busokelo District Council ({{convert|847.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}).{{r|MbeyaRC_InvGuide|p=12}}

===Climate===
The Mbeya Region has a [[tropical climate]], with lowlands temperatures of {{convert|25|C|F}} and highlands temperatures of {{convert|16|C|F}}. The rainy season lasts from October to May. The [[Usangu Plains]] and [[Chunya District|Chunya]] receive {{convert|650|mm|in}} of rain annually, while the mountains of [[Rungwe District]] Council and the northern coasts of Lake Nyasa receive {{convert|2600|mm|in|abbr=on}}. June through September are the cold and dry months in the area. The soils and vegetation types in the area exhibit significant variance. Most of the region's arable land has soils with a medium texture, moderate fertility, and ranges from sandy loams to alluvial soils to cracked clays. The majority of the territory is covered with [[Miombo]] woodland, with annual rainfall ranging from {{convert|800|to|1200|mm|in|abbr=on}}. Less rainy areas, particularly in the region's north, encourage the development of dense acacia and other thorny tree thickets as well as woodland grassland.{{r|MbeyaRC_InvGuide|p=14-15}}

===Geology===
It was announced in February 2012 that the collapsed volcano approximately {{convert|200|km}} north of Mbeya, Mount [[Ngualla]], contained one of the largest rare earth oxide deposits in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20120229/pdf/424pl5vn67q4h0.pdf |title=Peak Resources - Maiden Resource, Ngualla Rare Earth Project, ASX Announcement, 29 February 2012 |access-date=11 April 2012 |archive-date=16 April 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416073235/http://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20120229/pdf/424pl5vn67q4h0.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Economy==
===Agriculture===
Agriculture (crops and cattle), natural resources (forest, fish, wildlife, and minerals), tourism, and industrial growth are the key producing sectors of the Mbeya Region that serve as the main engines of the regional economy. The economic performance of the Mbeya Region are dominated by agriculture, which employs roughly 80% of the working population in the area and makes up about 40% of the regional economy. Agriculture consists primarily of peasant farming, with a limited amount of commercial production of [[rice]] in [[Mbarali District]] and [[tea]] in [[Rungwe District]].{{r|MbeyaRC_InvGuide|p=20,45-51}}

Tanzania's Mbeya Region is renowned for producing a wide range of food crops, including [[maize]], paddy, sorghum, beans, round potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava, [[Banana|bananas]], groundnuts, simsim, fruits, and vegetables. From 2017 to 2019, the largest food producers were the Rungwe, Mbeya, and Mbarali District Councils, with annual production of 1,144,346.4 tonnes (37.2%) (Rungwe District Council), 530,064.8 tonnes (17.2%), and 490,644.3 tonnes (15.9%), respectively (Mbarali District Council). The primary crop of Mbeya is [[Potato|potatoes]], which produce 925,266.9 tonnes. Maize comes in second with 669,079.8, followed by banana plantains (541,493.0 tonnes), paddy (396,044.8 tonnes), cassava (231,853.4 tonnes), and sweet potatoes (170,906.8 tonnes). Beans, wheat, sorghum, cow peas, and cocoyam are some more crops with an annual production below 100,000 tonnes.{{r|MbeyaRC_InvGuide|p=15-19}}

[[Coffee]], tea, tobacco, [[pyrethrum]], wheat, sunflower, spices, cocoa, and oil palm are the principal cash crops farmed in the area. Smallholder farmers are the principal producers of these crops. The Rungwe and Busokelo districts are primarily where tea, coffee, and spice crops are grown. In the Mbeya District, pyrethrum and wheat are produced; in the Kyela, Rungwe, and Busokelo districts, [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[Elaeis|oil palm]] are primarily planted. Sunflower is grown in Mbarali and [[Chunya District|Chunya]] Districts, whereas [[tobacco]] is primarily grown in Chunya District.{{r|MbeyaRC_InvGuide|p=45-51}}

===Industry===
Small-scale agroindustrial and forestry-based businesses make up the majority of the Mbeya Region's industrial sector. 3,540 small businesses operated in the area in 2016, with more businesses engaged in milling (39.5%), carpentry (26.8%), [[timber]] processing (11.5%), and welding (9.0%). 6,800 persons were employed overall by them. 13 medium-sized businesses operated in the area during that time, with Mbeya City accounting for 61.5 percent of all businesses in this category. There aren't many large-scale industries, but those that do exist include those that make [[cement]], brew beer, process tea, make soft beverages, and produce [[granite]] and [[marble]]. Mbeya City Council is where the majority of industries are located, followed by Rungwe District Council.{{r|MbeyaRC_InvGuide|p=29}}

Mineral diversity is abundant in the Mbeya Region. The majority of minerals in the area have not yet been exploited and are currently being mined by small-scale operators using [[Artisanal mining|artisanal]] technologies. [[Gold]], coal, sand, stones, morum, and industrial minerals including marble, limestone, iron ore, and phosphates are among the different types of minerals that may be found in the area. Additionally, the Mbeya District Council, Rungwe District, and Mbarali District also have significant marble reserves (Chalihumbi & Lugelele). Large gold reserves may be discovered across Chunya, Mbarali (Mabadaga), and Kyela (Mwalisi & Luvalisi).{{r|MbeyaRC_SocEcoPro|p=84-87}}

===Wildlife and Reserves===
Wildlife can be found in great variety in the Mbeya Region. The area is home to two national parks ([[Ruaha National Park|Ruaha]] and [[Kitulo National Park|Kitulo]]) and four game reserves namely; Mpanga Kipengere, Usungu, Rukwati Piti Game Reserve and Mount Rungwe Game Reserve. Natural open spaces including Rungwa Mzombe and Rungwa South, and a number of game restricted areas.{{r|MbeyaRC_InvGuide|p=25-28}}

==Demographics==
The historic native tribes of the Mbeya region are of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] origin, and it is thought that they have lived there for a very long period. They are the [[Sangu people|Sangu]], [[Safwa people|Safwa]], [[Nyakyusa people|Nyakyusa]], [[Ndali people|Ndali]], [[Kinga people|Kinga]], [[Wanji people|Wanji]], [[Lambya people|Lambya]], [[Nyiha people|Nyiha]], [[Lungu people|Wungu]], [[Kimbu people|Kimbu]] & [[Rungwa people|Rungwa]]. The Maasai and [[Sukuma people|Sukuma]] now live in the Chunya and Mbeya Districts as a result of extensive interregional and intraregional movement of tribes between 1970 and 1990. In urban areas like Mbeya Municipality and the District centers, a fairly diverse tribal population is typical.<ref name="MbeyaRC_hist">{{cite web |title=Historia |url=https://mbeya.go.tz/historia |publisher=Mkoa wa Mbeya |access-date=12 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220617103839/https://mbeya.go.tz/historia |archive-date=17 June 2022 |location=Mbeya |language=sw |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Population change post-independence===
From 776,373 in the 1967 census to 1,080,241 in the 1978 census, the population of the Mbeya area increased at a pace of 3.3% per year, as opposed to an average of 3.4% per year during the 1957 and 1967 population census. By the time of the 1988 population census, there were 1,476,199 inhabitants in the country. This made Mbeya one of the most populous regions in Tanzania after [[Shinyanga Region|Shinyanga]] and [[Mwanza Region|Mwanza]], making up around 6% of the country's total population on the mainland. Mbeya is consequently one of the areas with rapid population expansion. Population growth was 3.1 percent, according to the census of 1988. According to a 3.1 percent yearly average growth rate from 1978 to 1988, the region's population is predicted to be 2.2 million people by the year 2000.{{r|MbeyaRC_SocEcoPro|p=7-9}}

According to the 2012 national census, the region had a population of 2,707,410, which was lower than the pre-census projection of 2,822,396.<ref name="2012 Census">[http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf Population Distribution by Administrative Units, United Republic of Tanzania, 2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502230453/http://www.nbs.go.tz/sensa/PDF/Census%20General%20Report%20-%2029%20March%202013_Combined_Final%20for%20Printing.pdf |date=2 May 2013 }}</ref>{{rp|page 2}} For 2002-2012, the region's 2.7 percent average annual population growth rate was tied for the tenth highest in the country.<ref name="2012 Census" />{{rp|page 4}} It was also tied for the eighteenth most densely populated region with 45 people per square kilometre.<ref name="2012 Census" />{{rp|page 6}}
