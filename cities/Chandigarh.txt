'''Chandigarh''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|tʃ|ʌ|n|d|ɪ|ˈ|ɡ|ɑr}}) is a city and [[union territory]] in northern [[India]], serving as the shared capital of the [[States of india|state]]s of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Haryana]]. Situated near the foothills of the [[Himalayas]], it borders Haryana to the east and Punjab in the remaining directions. Chandigarh constitutes the bulk of the [[Chandigarh Capital Region]] or Greater Chandigarh, which also includes the adjacent [[Satellite city|satellite cities]] of [[Panchkula]] in Haryana and [[Mohali]] in Punjab. It is located 260&nbsp;km (162 miles) north of [[New Delhi]] and 229&nbsp;km (143 miles) southeast of [[Amritsar]].

Chandigarh is one of the earliest [[planned cities]] in [[History of the Republic of India (1947–present)|post independence India]] and is internationally known for its architecture and urban design.<ref name="ci2">{{cite web|url=http://business.gov.in/investment_incentives/chandigarh.php|title=Business Portal of India : Investment Opportunities and Incentives : State Level Investment : Chandigarh|work=business.gov.in|access-date=12 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017092219/http://business.gov.in/investment_incentives/chandigarh.php|archive-date=17 October 2013}}</ref> The master plan of the city was prepared by Swiss-French architect [[Le Corbusier]], which built upon earlier plans created by the Polish architect [[Maciej Nowicki (architect)|Maciej Nowicki]] and the American planner [[Albert Mayer (planner)|Albert Mayer]]. Most of the government buildings and housing in the city were designed by a team headed by Le Corbusier, [[Jane Drew]] and [[Maxwell Fry]].

==Etymology==
The name ''Chandigarh'' is a [[Compound (linguistics)|compound]] of ''Chandi'' and ''Garh''. ''Chandi'' refers to the Hindu goddess [[Chandi]] and ''Garh'' means fortress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cii.in/chandigarh|title=CII|work=cii.in|access-date=12 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406234407/http://www.cii.in/chandigarh|archive-date=6 April 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The name is derived from [[Chandi Mandir]], an ancient temple devoted to Chandi near the city in [[Panchkula]] District.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newkerala.com/states-of-india/chandigarh.php|title=Chandigarh: Info on geography, history, government, districts, business, economy, travel, rivers, education, food, arts, culture, music, dance, festivals|work=newkerala.com|access-date=12 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317182551/http://www.newkerala.com/states-of-india/chandigarh.php|archive-date=17 March 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The motif or sobriquet of "The City of Beauty" was derived from the [[City Beautiful movement]], which was a popular philosophy in North American urban planning during the 1890s and 1900s. Architect [[Albert Mayer (planner)|Albert Mayer]], the initial planner of Chandigarh, lamented the American rejection of ''City Beautiful'' concepts and declared, "We want to create a beautiful city..."<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kalia|first1=Ravi|title=Chandigarh : in search of an identity|date=1987|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press|location=Carbondale|isbn=978-0809313105|page=54|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-s0g47oeb34C&q=city+beautiful}}</ref> The phrase was used as a logo in official publications in the 1970s and is now how the city describes itself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Office of the Registrar General, R.

As part of the [[partition of India]] in 1947, the [[Punjab Province (British India)|former Indian province of Punjab]] was divided into two parts, the mostly Hindu and Sikh [[East Punjab]] in India, and the mostly Muslim [[West Punjab]] in [[Pakistan]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citybeautiful.in/chandigarhhistory.aspx|title=Chandigarh history|work=City Beautiful|access-date=21 March 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505154250/http://www.citybeautiful.in/chandigarhhistory.aspx|archive-date=5 May 2015}}</ref> The capital of undivided Punjab, [[Lahore]], had become part of Pakistan after the partition.

Albert Mayer developed a [[City block#Superblock|superblock]]-based city interspersed with green spaces, with an emphasis on cellular neighbourhoods and traffic segregation. His site plan took advantage of natural land characteristics; the land's gentle grade promoted proper drainage. Mayer stopped his work on the city after his architect-partner [[Matthew Nowicki]] died in a plane crash in 1950. Government officials recruited [[Le Corbusier]] to succeed Mayer and Nowicki, who utilised many elements of Mayer's original plan without attributing them to him.<ref name="Banerjee">{{cite journal|last=Banerjee|first=Tridib|title=U.S. Planning Expeditions to Postcolonial India: From Ideology to Innovation in Technical Assistance|journal=Journal of the American Planning Association|year=2009|volume=75|issue=2|pages=193–208|doi=10.1080/01944360902790711|s2cid=220461503}}</ref>
Le Corbusier designed many administration buildings, including the High Court, the Palace of Assembly, and the Secretariat Building. Le Corbusier also designed the general layout of the city, dividing it into sectors. Chandigarh hosts the largest of Le Corbusier's many ''Open Hand'' sculptures, standing 26&nbsp;metres high. ''[[Open Hand Monument|The Open Hand (La Main Ouverte)]]'' is a recurring motif in Le Corbusier's architecture, a sign for him of "peace and reconciliation. It is open to give and open to receive."

During excavations at the time of the building of the city, some Indus Valley artefacts were discovered, suggesting that the area that is today Chandigarh was home to some settlements of the [[Indus Valley civilisation]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Staff|date=14 November 2008|title=Chandigarh was part of Harappan civilization 5,000 years ago|url=https://www.oneindia.com/2008/11/14/chandigarh-harappan-civilisation-5000-years-ago-1226661360.html|access-date=19 August 2021|website=Oneindia}}</ref>
On 1 November 1966, after a long-drawn [[Punjabi Suba movement|movement]] demanding the formation of a Punjabi state, the former state of Punjab was [[Punjab Reorganisation Act, 1966|split in two]]. The western and northern mostly [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]-speaking portion became the present-day state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], while the eastern and southern Hindi- and [[Haryanvi language|Haryanvi]]-speaking areas became [[Haryana]]. Chandigarh ended up being located on the border of the two states, and both of them moved to incorporate the city into their respective territories. However, the city of Chandigarh was controlled directly by the central government and was to serve as the shared capital of the two states until a resolution could be reached.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.haryana-online.com/History/history_1966-.htm|title=1st November 1966 – Haryana Day|publisher=Haryana Online|access-date=8 July 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002001513/http://haryana-online.com/History/history_1966-.htm|archive-date=2 October 2013}}</ref>

It has been noted by industrialists that large real-estate projects have stagnated since the creation of Chandigarh in Punjab and Haryana as an economic rival city would be perceived as a city that could be used as capital instead of Chandigarh and hence relinquishing the state of rights over Chandigarh.[https://indianexpress.com/article/explained/explained-punjab-resolution-chandigarh-capital-7848602/]

Present-day Chandigarh was also the site of a short-lived late 18th-century principality, with a [[Manimajra Fort|small fort]] at [[Mani Majra]]. Many villages that predate the city are still inhabited within the modern blocks of some sectors, including ''Burail'' and ''Attawa'', while several other such villages lie on the margins of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chandigarh.gov.in/cmp2031/villages.pdf|title=villages.pdf|publisher=chandigarh.gov.in|access-date=9 September 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151223231037/http://chandigarh.gov.in/cmp2031/villages.pdf|archive-date=23 December 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city, lying in the northern plains, includes a vast area of flat, fertile land. Its northeast covers sections of [[Bhabar]], while the remainder of its terrain is part of the [[Terai]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bharatonline.com/chandigarh/travel-tips/location.html|title=Chandigarh > Travel tips > Location|work=bharatonline.com|access-date=26 March 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223134749/http://www.bharatonline.com/chandigarh/travel-tips/location.html|archive-date=23 December 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Its surrounding cities are [[Mohali]], [[New Chandigarh]], [[Patiala]], [[Zirakpur]] and [[Rupnagar]] in Punjab, and [[Panchkula]] and [[Ambala]] in Haryana.

Chandigarh is situated 44&nbsp;km (28 miles) north of [[Ambala]], 229&nbsp;km (143 miles) southeast of [[Amritsar]], and 250&nbsp;km (156 miles) north of [[Delhi]].

===Climate===
[[File:Kasauli Hills Snow.jpg|thumb|Chandigarh skyline in winter]]
Chandigarh has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa'') characterised by a seasonal rhythm: very hot summers, mild winters, unreliable rainfall, and great temperature variation ({{convert|−1|to|45|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}). The average annual rainfall is {{convert|1110.7|mm|in|2|disp=or}}.<ref>{{cite web|title=Know Chandigarh|url=http://chandigarh.nic.in/knowchd_general.htm|website=Official Website of Chandigarh Administration|access-date=2 April 2020|date=21 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721164933/http://chandigarh.nic.in/knowchd_general.htm|archive-date=21 July 2011}}</ref> The city also receives occasional winter rains from the [[Western Disturbance]] originating over the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. The western disturbances bring rain predominantly from mid-December until the end of April, which can be heavier sometimes with strong wind and hail if the weather turns colder (during March–April months), which usually proves disastrous to local crops. Cold winds usually tend to come from the Himalayas that lie to the north, which receive snowfall during wintertime.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

The city experiences the following seasons and the respective average temperatures:
* '''Spring''': During spring (from February-end to mid-April), temperatures vary between a maximum of {{convert|13|to|20|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} and a minimum of {{convert|5|to|12|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}.
* '''Autumn''': In autumn (from September-end to mid-November), the temperature may rise to a maximum of {{convert|30|°C|disp=or}}. Temperatures usually remain between {{convert|10|and|22|°C|°F|1|disp=or}} in autumn. The minimum temperature is around {{convert|6|°C|1|disp=or}}.
* '''Summer''': The temperature in summer (from mid-April to mid-June) usually peaks at around {{convert|43|°C|1|disp=or}} in mid-June, and generally varies between {{convert|38|and|42|°C|1}}.
* '''Monsoon''': During the monsoon season (from mid-June to mid-September), Chandigarh receives moderate to heavy rainfall and sometimes heavy to very heavy rainfall (generally during August or September). Usually, the rain-bearing monsoon winds blow from the southwest/southeast. The city mostly receives heavy rain from the south (which is mainly persistent rain), but it generally receives most of its rain during the monsoon season either from the northwest or the northeast.

===Background===
Nehru said of Chandigarh when he first visited the site of the new city in 1952: "Let this be a new town, symbolic of the freedom of India, unfettered by the traditions of the past, an expression of the nation's faith in the future".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/08/17/chandigarh-exhibited-in-new-york/|title=Chandigarh Exhibited in New York|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|access-date=7 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101025024/http://blogs.wsj.com/indiarealtime/2013/08/17/chandigarh-exhibited-in-new-york/|archive-date=1 January 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> For Nehru, Chandigarh represented a vision of how a new planned city could be a canvas for the regeneration of the nation itself after centuries of oppression under British colonial rule and the dilution of Indian character from the nation's towns. Guided by the architectural optics of [[Le Corbusier]], the development of Chandigarh was part of a state-driven exercise to break from the traditions of imperialism in [[urban planning|city making]] and begin the process of healing from the injustices suffered.<ref name="Making Chandigarh">{{cite book|last=Kalia|first=Ravi|date=1990|title=Chandigarh: The making of an Indian city|location=New Delhi|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=5|isbn=978-0-195-65030-3}}</ref>

To the extent that Chandigarh epitomises the destructive influence of the British, in the impetus of its creation as a solution to the otherwise violent partitioning of territory between India and Pakistan, it represents an early ideological symbol for the birth of India's future. The selection of the physical site involved an extensive vetting process. Many existing towns in Punjab were surveyed as options for the new capital and dismissed for poor performance concerning factors such as military defensibility and capacity for accommodating potential refugee influxes. The construction of a new town in Chandigarh was determined to be the best option due to its relative strength in these factors as well as its proximity to the national capital, New Delhi, its central location within the state of Punjab, its abundance of fecund land and its beautiful natural landscape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chandigarh.gov.in/knowchd_gen_historical.htm|title=Historical Background|work=Government of Chandigarh|access-date=7 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519173408/http://http/|archive-date=19 May 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Modernism in new town design===
Off the back of this conflation of assets Chandigarh then was well poised to serve a function as a city-building project in national identity. From a federal policy perspective, the development of the new town became a tool in India for modernisation and an intended driver of economic activity, legal reform, and regional growth as well as a significant agent for the [[decolonisation]] project.<ref name="National Identity">{{cite book|last=Kalia|first=Ravi|date=2004|title=Gandhinagar: Building National Identity in Postcolonial India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RVhNO2MwOCAC&q=postcolonial+chandigarh&pg=PR9|location=Columbia|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Pres|page=2|isbn=978-1-570-03544-9}}</ref> As Britain's grip on [[British Raj|their empire]] began to weaken [[Partition of India|their accelerated withdrawal]] between the beginning of the second world war and 1947 left their former colony in states of disarray and disorganisation, and policymakers for the new Indian government were required to contend with issues such as rapid rural depopulation, urban congestion, and poverty. As well as in Chandigarh this policy tool was implemented in the creation of new capital cities in [[Bhubaneswar]] and [[Gandhinagar]], and more broadly throughout India in the [[List of planned cities#India|112 planned cities]] created between independence and 1971, purposed to absorb migration from those regions in demise after being abandoned by the British and provide hubs for growing industries such as in steel and energy.<ref name="Indian new towns">{{cite report|author=K. C. Sivaramakrishnan|date=1976–1977|title=New Towns in India: A Report on a Study of Selected New Towns in the Eastern region|url=http://www.cprindia.org/sites/default/files/books/NEW%20TOWNS%20IN%20INDIA_1.pdf|publisher=Indian Institute of Management Calcutta|page=4|access-date=12 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180516132444/http://www.cprindia.org/sites/default/files/books/NEW%20TOWNS%20IN%20INDIA_1.pdf|archive-date=16 May 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

These examples from a genealogy of [[Ideal city|utopian urban forms]] developed in post-independence India as a panacea for issues related to [[underdevelopment]] as well as post-independence complications to do with separatist religious conflict and the resulting diplomatic tensions. Chandigarh is the first example of a state-funded master-planned [[modernization theory|modernisation scheme]]. These "urban utopias" attempt to enforce nation-building policies through a federalised rule of law at a regional level, and diffuse postcolonial urbanism which codes justice in its design.<ref name="urban utopias">{{cite journal|last1=Datta|first1=Ayona|s2cid=54070842|title=New urban utopias of postcolonial India: 'Entrepreneurial urbanization' in Dholera smart city, Gujarat|journal=Dialogues in Human Geography|volume=5|issue=1|pages=4|doi=10.1177/2043820614565748|url=http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/83074/3/__ds.leeds.ac.uk_staff_staff15_libmh_SCoReS_Repository_Datta_paper_sympletic%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref> The intent is that the economic success and progressivism of cities such as Chandigarh as a lightning rod for social change would gradually be emulated at the scale of the nation. Chandigarh was for Nehru and Le Corbusier an embodiment of the egalitarian potential offered by [[modernism]], where the machine age would complete the liberation of the nation's citizens through the productive capacity of industrial technology and the relative ease of constructing civic facilities such as dams, hospitals, and schools; the very antithesis of the conservative and traditional legacy of colonialism.<ref name="National Identity"/> Though built as a state capital Chandigarh came to be focused on industry and higher education.<ref name="Indian new towns"/> The specialisation of these new towns in particular functions represents a crucial aspect of the modernisation process as a decolonising enterprise, in completing a national portfolio where each town forms a part of the utopian model for contemporary India.

The post-colonialism of Chandigarh is rooted in the transformation of the political ideas of those such as Nehru who generated a new Indian nationalism through the design of newly built forms.<ref name="postcolonial">{{cite journal|last1=Shaw|first1=Annapurna|s2cid=145266110|title=Town Planning in Postcolonial India, 1947–1965: Chandigarh Re-Examined|journal=Urban Geography|volume=30|issue=8|pages=864–873|doi=10.2747/0272-3638.30.8.857|year=2009}}</ref> Scholars such as [[Edward Said]] have emphasised the sinister nature of nostalgia and the romanticisation of colonial architecture in newly independent colonies as artefacts that perpetuate the ideological legacy of the hegemony and replicate the hierarchy of power even after decolonisation.<ref name="decolonisation">{{cite journal|last1=James-Chakraborty|first1=Kathleen|title=Beyond postcolonialism: New directions for the history of nonwestern architecture|journal=Frontiers of Architectural Research|volume=3|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.1016/j.foar.2013.10.001|year=2014|doi-access=free}}</ref> Insofar as modernism in architecture (which defined town planning under the Nehru era of rule) represents an active radical break from tradition and a colonial past even the very presence of Le Corbusier has been recognised as an indelible resistance to the British construction legacy, as he provided the first non-British influence on design thinking in India, enabling a generational shift in the contemporary cohort of architects and planners to be hired by the state throughout the rest of the century who were initiated under Modernist conditioning.<ref name="postcolonial"/>

As early as the 1950s the presence of the [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] could be detected in the design of houses in India, "whether [[mistri]] or architect-designed".<ref name="independent architecture">{{cite book|last1=Lang|first1=Jon|last2=Desai|first2=Madhavi|last3=Desai|first3=Miki|date=1997|title=Architecture and Independence: The Search for Identity—India 1880 to 1980|location=New York, NY|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|page=213|isbn=978-0-195-63900-1}}</ref> The development of low-cost housing was a priority for Chandigarh, and the modern forms designed by Corbusier are characterised by a dispensing with colonial forms focused on classic aesthetics and a refocusing on strategies such as using narrow frontages and orientation for minimising direct exposure to the sun and maximising natural ventilation and efficient cost while providing modern amenities in the International Style aesthetic.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Iain|s2cid=143917493|title=Maxwell Fry and Jane Drew's early housing and neighborhood planning in Sector-22, Chandigarh|journal=Planning Perspectives|volume=28|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1080/02665433.2013.734993|year=2013|bibcode=2013PlPer..28....1J}}</ref> These developments are credited as the beginning of a "Chandigarh architecture", inspiring gradual experimentation with form and an "Indianising" of the International Style which precipitated the formation of the country's new cultural identity in town design.<ref name="postcolonial"/>

In 2024, ''Tropical Modernism: Architecture and Independence'', an exhibition at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London, featured designs for Chandigarh.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/tropical-modernism-architecture-and-independence|title=V&A South Kensington – Tropical Modernism: Architecture and Independence|year=2024|website=[[Victoria and Albert Museum]]|access-date=1 May 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240430082749/https://www.vam.ac.uk/exhibitions/tropical-modernism-architecture-and-independence|archive-date=30 April 2024|quote=Tropical Modernism was an architectural style developed in the hot, humid conditions of West Africa in the 1940s. After independence, India and Ghana adopted the style as a symbol of modernity and progressiveness, distinct from colonial culture.}}</ref>

===Criticisms===
Criticisms are well established regarding the implementation of the postcolonial vision of Nehru and Le Corbusier and the critical emphasis on its influence. Claims have been made that the focus on Corbusier's architect-centred discourse erases the plural authorship of the narrative of Chandigarh's development, arguing that it was, in fact, a hybridity of values and of "contested modernities" of Western and indigenous Indian origin and cultural exchanges rather than an uncontested administrative enterprise.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Perera|first1=Nihal|s2cid=220332059|title=Contesting visions: hybridity, liminality, and authorship of the Chandigarh plan|journal=Planning Perspectives|volume=19|issue=2|pages=178|doi=10.1080/0266543042000192466|year=2004|bibcode=2004PlPer..19..175P}}</ref> Such criticism is consistent with claims that decolonisation in India has marked a shift from segregation based on race to segregation based on class and that planned cities are truly "designed" ones which represent the values and interests of a westernised middle-class Indian elite which ignore the complexities of India's diverse ethnic and cultural landscape and enabled neocolonial hierarchies such as the imposition of the Hindi language on non-conforming castes.<ref name="Making Chandigarh"/><ref name="National Identity"/><ref name="postcolonial"/>

[[Brent C. Brolin]] argues that Le Corbusier ignored Indian preferences in designing the housing and communities and that the residents have done what they can to recreate their accustomed lifestyle.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brolin|first1=Brent C.|date=1976|title=The Failure of Modern Architecture|location=London, England|publisher=Studio Vista|isbn=0289707536}}</ref> Furthermore, the early over-saturation of the minimalist International Style in building design in Chandigarh has attracted criticisms of effecting a "democratic, self-effacing banality", though this criticism is perhaps negligent of how this was necessary for galvanising higher standards of urban living throughout the country.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bhatt|first1=Vikram|last2=Scriver|first2=Peter|date=1990|title=Contemporary Indian Architecture: After the Masters.|location=Ahmedabad, India|publisher=Mapin|page=15|isbn=978-0-944-14219-6}}</ref>
