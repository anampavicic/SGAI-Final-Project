The '''Kaolack region''' is a region in [[Senegal]].  It borders [[Gambia]] and is a common stopping point for travel between [[Dakar]] and [[Banjul]].  Its borders correspond roughly to the [[Saloum|Saalum]] Kingdom of precolonial days, and the area is still spoken of as the ''Saalum'' in Wolof, and its inhabitants are called ''Saalum-Saalum''.

[[Kaolack]] city is the administrative centre for the region. It is a port on the Saloum River. Lying in a farm area, Kaolack is a major [[peanut]] marketing and exporting center and has a large peanut oil factory. Brewing, leather tanning, cotton ginning, and fish processing are also important industries. Salt is produced from salines near the Saloum River. The city is on the railroad from Dakar to the [[Niger River]] in [[Mali]]. Kaolack is the international centre of the Ibrahimiyyah branch of the [[Tijaniyyah]] [[Sufi]] order, whose mosque is on the city's outskirts.

==Departments==
The Kaolack Region is subdivided into three departments:
*[[Guinguinéo Department|Guinguinéo Département]]
*[[Kaolack Department|Kaolack Département]]
*[[Nioro du Rip Department|Nioro du Rip Département]]
