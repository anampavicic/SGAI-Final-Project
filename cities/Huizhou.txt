'''Huizhou''' ({{lang-zh|c={{linktext|惠州}}}}) is a city in central-east [[Guangdong]] Province, China, forty-three miles north of [[Hong Kong]]. Huizhou borders the provincial capital of [[Guangzhou]] to the west, [[Shenzhen]] and [[Dongguan]] to the southwest, [[Shaoguan]] to the north, [[Heyuan]] to the northeast, [[Shanwei]] to the east, and [[Daya Bay]] of the [[South China Sea]] to the south. As of the 2020 census, the city has about 6,042,852 inhabitants and is administered as a [[prefecture-level city]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area - Map(Huizhou)|url=https://www.bayarea.gov.hk/en/about/huizhou.html|access-date=2021-02-28|website=www.bayarea.gov.hk}}</ref> Huizhou's core metropolitan area, which is within Huicheng and Huiyang Districts, is home to around 2,090,578 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/china/guangdong/admin/|title = China: Guăngdōng (Prefectures, Cities, Districts and Counties) - Population Statistics, Charts and Map}}</ref>

==History==
During the [[Song dynasty]], Huizhou was a prefectural capital of the Huiyang prefecture and the cultural center of the region.<ref name="Vogel1990">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NU2NLLjO1fUC&pg=PA225|title=One Step Ahead in China: Guangdong Under Reform|author=Ezra F. Vogel|date=October 1990|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-63911-9|pages=225–226}}</ref>

The West Lake in Huizhou was formerly known as Feng Lake. At the age of 59, [[Su Shi]] was exiled to Huizhou by the imperial government of Song. When he visited Feng Lake in Huizhou, he found it located in the west of the city and was as beautiful as [[West Lake|West Lake in Hangzhou]]. Therefore, he renamed it the West Lake. In order to solve the traffic problems on both sides of West Lake, he invested to help build two bridges. Later generations named bridges as the bridge Su Di to commemorate his achievements. And the two bridges in the West Lake becomes one of the eight scenic spots in the West Lake, called "Su Di Play Moon".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=黄建萍|date=1997 |script-title=zh:东坡到处有西湖|url=http://www.cqvip.com/QK/82190X/199703/665698873199703018.html|script-journal=zh:江苏政协|issue=3|pages=32}}</ref>

=== Daya Bay ===
{{main|Daya Bay}}
Daya Bay is located to the southeast of Huizhou City, on the South China Sea, with waters covering an area of nearly {{convert|500|km2|abbr=on}}. There are nearly 100 islands and reefs in the bay. The climate is described as a typical subtropical [[oceanic climate]], with temperatures averaging {{cvt|21.8|C}} over the year. Historically, Daya Bay had whales and turtles.<ref>[https://www.porttechnology.org/images/uploads/technical_papers/PT29-06.pdf Dredging in China under strict environment control] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160406191455/https://www.porttechnology.org/images/uploads/technical_papers/PT29-06.pdf|date=2016-04-06}}</ref><ref>[http://www.chncup.com/?action=news&method=news&id=6664 大辣甲岛海域现死亡鲸鱼 死因未明]</ref> The bay was one of the breeding grounds along the southern coast of China for Asian population of [[gray whale]]s which are now one of the most endangered whale population in the world. They migrated here to calve in the winter-spring seasons. Other species, such as [[humpback whale]]s also migrated here historically. All of these were wiped out by Japanese whalers established whaling stations on various sites on Chinese coasts including at nearby Daya Bay.<ref>Jefferson A.T., Hung K.S., 2007, [http://www.degruyter.com/dg/viewarticle.fullcontentlink:pdfeventlink/$002fj$002fmamm.2007.71.issue-3$002fmamm.2007.021$002fmamm.2007.021.pdf?format=INT&t:ac=j$002fmamm.2007.71.issue-3$002fmamm.2007.021$002fmamm.2007.021.xml An updated, annotated checklist of the marine mammals of Hong Kong], Mammalia (2007) – DOI 10.1515/MAMM.2007.021, pp.105–114</ref><ref>Rockwell D.H., 2009, [http://csiwhalesalive.org/csi2009_04.pdf When in Rome, Do as the Whales Do!] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504084933/http://fiordlandkindy.blogspot.jp/2009/04/whales-at-doubtful-sound.html |date=4 May 2014 }}</ref> Critically endangered [[Chinese white dolphin]]s and occasional whales such as humpbacks have been confirmed in the bay recent years.<ref>[http://shenzhen.sina.com.cn/news/m/2016-07-26/detail-ifxuhukv7473961.shtml 大亚湾发现中华白海豚 专家：应保持百米安全距离]</ref>
