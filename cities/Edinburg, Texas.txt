Edinburg is part of the [[McAllen–Edinburg–Mission metropolitan area|McAllen–Edinburg–Mission]] and [[Reynosa–McAllen Metropolitan Area|Reynosa–McAllen]] metropolitan areas. Edinburg is home to the main campus of University of Texas Rio Grande Valley.

==History==
In 1908, John Closner, William Briggs, Argyle McAllen, Plutarco de la Viña, and Dennis B. Chapin began to develop a new community at this site. The town square was located at the current crossroads of [[U.S. Route 281 in Texas|U.S. Highway 281]] and [[Texas State Highway 107|State Highway 107]]. The town was named "Chapin" in honor of one of the developers. A local myth relates that Edinburg became the county seat of Hidalgo County in a dramatic, nighttime covert operation in which the county records were removed from the previous county seat. However, historical records show more practical reasons. The 1886 Hidalgo County Courthouse in the city of [[Hidalgo, Texas|Hidalgo]] was under frequent danger of flooding because it stood just a few yards away from the banks of the [[Rio Grande]]. Additionally, the county was over 80 miles long at this time, and state law required that the courthouse be close to the geographic center of a county.<ref>{{YouTube|351Ve-3oWi0|Edinburg 2013 State of the City Address}}</ref> A wood-frame courthouse was designed and built beside the Chapin courthouse square in 1908; construction on a grand courthouse within the square began in 1910 under the supervision of San Antonio builders and a partnership of San Antonio architects.<ref>{{Cite web|last=LIMBACHER & GODFREY Architects|date=May 2012|title=Historic HIDALGO COUNTY COURTHOUSE|url=http://agenda.hidalgocounty.us/mindocs/2012/CC/20121120_1752/minutes/51_HCCHMP_historical3&#91;1&#93;.pdf|access-date=May 20, 2021|pages=12–14|archive-date=May 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210521023626/http://agenda.hidalgocounty.us/mindocs/2012/CC/20121120_1752/minutes/51_HCCHMP_historical3%5B1%5D.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>  When Dennis Chapin was involved in the shooting death of Oscar J. Rountree at the Dan Breen Saloon in [[San Antonio]],<ref>''San Antonio Light'', December 7, 1911, p.2</ref> the community changed its name to "Edinburg" to honor John Young, a prominent businessman who was born in [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]]. The town was officially renamed in 1911 and incorporated in 1919.
