'''Butuan''' (pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˌ|b|uː|t|ˈ|w|ɑː|n}}), officially the '''City of Butuan''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Butuan}}; [[Butuanon language|Butuanon]]: ''Dakbayan hong Butuan''; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Butuan}}), is a 1st class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] and the regional center of [[Caraga]], [[Philippines]]. It is the ''[[de facto]]'' capital of the province of Agusan del Norte where it is geographically situated but has an administratively independent government.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=March 3, 2016|title=Republic Act No. 8811; An Act Transferring the Capital and Seat of Government of the Province of Agusan del Norte from Butuan City to the Municipality of Cabadbaran, Agusan del Norte|url=http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/ra_11/RA08811.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303213103/http://www.congress.gov.ph/download/ra_11/RA08811.pdf|archive-date=March 3, 2016|access-date=December 4, 2015|website=Congress of the Philippines (official website)}}</ref> According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 372,910 people making it the most populous city in Caraga Region.{{PH census|current}}

It served as the former capital of the [[Butuan (historical state)|Rajahnate of Butuan]] before 1001 until about 1521. The city used to be known during that time as the best in gold and boat manufacturing in the entire Philippine archipelago, having traded with places as far as Champa, Ming, Srivijaya, Majapahit, and the Bengali coasts. It is located at the northeastern part of the Agusan Valley, [[Mindanao]], sprawling across the [[Agusan River]]. It is bounded to the north, west and south by [[Agusan del Norte]], to the east by [[Agusan del Sur]] and to the northwest by [[Butuan Bay]].

Butuan was the capital of the province of [[Agusan del Norte]] until 2000, when Republic Act 8811 transferred the capital to [[Cabadbaran]]. For statistical and geographical purposes by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], Butuan is grouped with Agusan del Norte but governed administratively independent from the province while legislatively administered by the province's 1st congressional district and also the most populous city in the province. However, the provincial government still holds office in Butuan, since the actual transfer of provincial offices to the new capital is still pending.<ref name=":0" />

==Etymology==
The name "Butuan" is believed to have originated from the sour fruit locally called ''[[garcinia morella|batuan]]''. Other etymological sources say that it comes from a certain Datu Buntuan, a chieftain who once ruled over areas of the present-day city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Diocese of Butuan |url=https://www.ucanews.com/directory/dioceses/philippines-butuan/399 |publisher=Union of Catholic Asian News |website=UCANews.com |access-date=October 5, 2022}}</ref>

According to Datu Makalipay, Butuan was named after the wife of Datu Balansag who was the ''tiniente de barangay'' of the area before.

==History==

===Old Butuan===
{{Main|Butuan (historical polity)}}
[[File:Butuan 1521.png|left|thumb|Map of the Rajahnate of Butuan in 1521.]]
[[File:Butuan Ivory Seal.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], housed and displayed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]].]]
[[File:The Balanghay.jpg|thumb|left|A replica of the [[balangay]] displayed in the city.]]

Butuan, during the pre-colonial times, was known as the [[Rajahnate of Butuan]], an [[Indianized kingdom]] known for its [[metallurgy|metallurgic industry]] and sophisticated naval technology. The rajahnate flourished at the 10th and 11th centuries CE, and had an extensive trade network with the [[Champa|Champa civilization]] and the [[Srivijaya|Srivijaya Empire]].<ref name="philippinealmanac.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |title=The Cultural Influences of India, China, Arabia, and Japan &#124; Philippine Almanac |access-date=February 6, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701082957/http://www.philippinealmanac.com/2010/07/528/the-cultural-influences-of-india-china-arabia-and-japan.html |archive-date=July 1, 2012 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/2071/ |title=Butuan Archeological Sites |publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date=January 2, 2014}}</ref>

By 1001, the rajahnate had established contact with the [[Song dynasty]] of [[China]]. The ''[[History of Song (Yuan dynasty)|History of Song]]'' recorded the appearance of a Butuan mission at the [[Chinese imperial court]], and the rajahnate was described as a small [[Hinduism|Hindu]] country with a [[Theravada Buddhism|Buddhist]] monarchy, which had a regular trade connection with [[Champa]]. The mission, under a king named "Kiling", asked for equal status in court protocol with the Champa envoy, but ultimately was denied by the imperial court.<ref>{{cite web|title=Timeline of history |url=http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm |access-date=October 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091123061819/http://valoable1.webs.com/timelineofhistory.htm |archive-date=November 23, 2009 }}</ref><ref>[[William Henry Scott (historian)|Scott, William]] ''Prehispanic Source Materials: For the Study of Philippine History'', p. 66</ref> However, under the reign of Sri Bata Shaja, the diplomatic equality was eventually granted to the kingdom, and as a result the diplomatic relations of the two nations reached its peak in the [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref>''Song Shi'' Chapter 7 to 8</ref>

Evidence of these trading links is in the discovery of 11 [[balangay]] boats around Ambangan in [[Barangay]] Libertad, which was described as the only concentration of archaeological, ancient, ocean-going boats in [[Southeast Asia]]. More evidence of the post was the discovery of a village in Libertad that specialized in gold, as well as the discovery of deformed skulls similar to reports in [[Sulawesi]]. Other assorted artifacts have also found by locals and [[treasure hunting|treasure hunters]].

===Colonial period===

On March 31, 1521, an [[Easter|Easter Sunday]], [[Ferdinand Magellan]] ordered a [[Catholic mass|mass]] to be celebrated. This was officiated by Friar Pedro Valderrama, the [[Andalusian people|Andalusian]] [[chaplain]] of the fleet, the only priest then. Another priest, the French Bernard Calmette (Bernardo Calmeta) had been [[marooning|marooned]] at [[Patagonia]] with Juan de Cartagena for being implicated in the mutiny at [[Puerto San Julián]]. Conducted near the shores of the island, the ''Holy First Mass'' marked the birth of [[Roman Catholicism in the Philippines]]. [[Rajah]] Colambu and Siaiu were said to be among the first natives of the soon-to-be [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish colony]] to attend the mass among other Mazaua inhabitants, together with visitors from Butuan who came with the entourage of Colambu, king of Butuan.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Controversy has been generated regarding the holding of the first mass—whether it was held in [[Limasawa]], [[Leyte]] or in Masao, Butuan, in the hidden isle made up of [[barangays]] Pinamanculan and Bancasi inside Butuan—in the latest discovered site in the small barangay of Barobo, situated near between [[Agusan del Sur]] and [[Surigao del Sur]], or elsewhere. It is sure, however, that Ferdinand Magellan did not drop anchor by the mouth of [[Agusan River]] in 1521 and hold mass to commemorate the event which was held at Mazaua, an island separate from Butuan which, in the geographical conception of Europeans who wrote about it, was a larger entity than what it is now. [[Antonio Pigafetta]] who wrote an eyewitness account of [[Magellan's voyage]] described in text and in map a Butuan that stretched from today's [[Surigao City|Surigao]] up to the top edge of [[Zamboanga del Norte]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

===Modern era===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
By the late 1940s to the 1970s, Butuan's industry specialized in [[timber]], earning it the nickname "Timber City of the South". The plentiful trees of the area invited many investors and migrants from [[Luzon]] and [[Visayas]] to the city, and inspired then Congressman Marcos M. Calo to file a bill elevating Butuan for cityhood. On August 2, 1950, this was passed, converting Butuan into a [[cities of the Philippines|city]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra523-butuan-city-charter.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712043612/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra523-butuan-city-charter.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 12, 2012 |title=R.A. No. 522, Butuan City Charter |publisher=LawPH.com |access-date=April 9, 2011 }}</ref>

However, by the early 1980s, the logging industry of the city began to decline, although the city was still an economic haven for many investors. The city's main income by that time frame and until this day depended on small and medium business, and large-scale projects by investors. On February 7, 1995, the city was reclassified from a chartered city to a highly urbanized city. Sixteen days later, on February 23, the region of [[Caraga]] was created by virtue of Republic Act 7901, with Butuan as its regional center, and the provincial capital of [[Agusan del Norte]]. In 2000, Republic Act 8811 formally transferred the capital of Agusan del Norte from Butuan to [[Cabadbaran]]; however most provincial offices are still located in the city.

In 2021, Timber City Academy, a school in Butuan, was ravaged by a fire.

In the summer of 2023, the Agusan Capitol was rocked by a bomb threat, which prevented the governor from entering the city due to threats of a [[New People's Army|rebel]] presence, according to some reports. Later on December of that year, the city was ravaged by a 7.6 magnitude [[December 2023 Mindanao earthquake|earthquake]], which damaged many parts of the city's buildings, such as [[SM City Butuan]], as well as schools and major bridges.

==Geography==
According to the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]], the City of Butuan has a total land area of {{convert|81662|ha}}, which is roughly 4.1% of the total area of the [[Caraga]] region.

Butuan is bordered by the municipalities of [[Magallanes, Agusan del Norte]] and [[Remedios T. Romualdez]] to the north, municipality of [[Sibagat]], [[Agusan del Sur]] to the northeast, east and southeast, municipality of [[Las Nieves, Agusan del Norte]] to the south, municipality of [[Buenavista, Agusan del Norte]] to the west and [[Butuan Bay]] to the northwest.

Butuan is {{convert|29|km}} away from the city of [[Cabadbaran]], the provincial capital of [[Agusan del Norte]], to the north. It is also {{convert|43|km}} away from [[Bayugan]] to the east and {{convert|75|km}} away from [[Gingoog]] to the west.

=== Elevation ===
Butuan is located at {{coord|format=dms}}. Elevation at these coordinates is estimated at 1.0 meter above [[sea level]] ([[M.a.s.l.]]).

=== Land Use ===
The existing land use of the city consists of the following uses: agriculture areas (397.23&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), forestland (268&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), grass/shrub/pasture land (61.14&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) and other uses (90.242&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). Of the total forestland, 105&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is production forest areas while 167.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is protection forest areas.

The forestland, as mentioned earlier, comprised both the production and protection forest. The classified forest is further specified as production forest and protection forest. In the production forest industrial tree species are mostly grown in the area. The protection forest on the other hand, is preserved to support and sustain necessary ecological performance. Included in this are the watershed areas in Taguibo, which is the main source of water in the area,

The city is endowed with swamplands near its coastal area. These swamp areas are interconnected with the waterways joined by the Agusan River. Most of the swamplands are actually mangroves that served as habitat to different marine species.

Filling material needs of the city are extracted usually from the riverbank of Taguibo River. Others are sourced out from promontories with special features and for special purpose.

The fishing ground of Butuan is Butuan Bay of which two coastal barangays are located. It extends some two kilometers to the sea and joins the Bohol Sea. These are the barangays of Lumbocan and Masao.

===Climate===
Butuan has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Af'').

Today, the indigenous Hadlayati tree abound, lording over a clonal nursery and tree park, amidst fishponds and archaeological treasures. According to the chronicles of Spanish historian Pigafetta, the event took place in the afternoon of March 31, 1521, after the Easter Mass was celebrated in the morning of the same date. Two Butuanon brother kings attended these Easter ceremonies. Pigafetta also noted the surrounding fields and balanghai boats on the bay that could be seen from the hill. The eco-park was established to provide the people of Butuan and its visitors a place to rekindle the past amidst a relaxing natural setting.

====Sea====
As a regional commercial and economic hub, the Port of Masao is Butuan's seaport. It was built to avoid having the city depend on the port of Nasipit, Agusan del Norte.

[[File:MacapagalBridge.jpg|thumb|The [[Macapagal Bridge]]]]
* Mayor Democrito O. Plaza II Avenue Circumferential Road and Diosdado Macapagal Bridge: The circumferential is a {{Convert|14|km}} diversion road from Barangay Bancasi to the southern part of the city proper crossing over the PP2.1 Billion Diosdado [[Macapagal Bridge]] to the main highway in Baan Km.3 and in Barangay Antongalon. The Diosdado Macapagal Bridge is the longest bridge in Mindanao, which is {{Convert|300|m}} upstream of the old Magsaysay Bridge and provides an alternate route across the [[Agusan River]] to connect the Philippine-Japan Friendship Highway (Surigao-Agusan-Davao road) and the Butuan-Cagayan-Iligan road. The bridge is popular as the only cable stayed bridge with steel deck and single tower in Mindanao, and it has a total length of about {{convert|806|m}}.

:It was during the presidency of Joseph Estrada that the project was approved which was lobbied by the city government way back President Fidel Ramos' time to decongest the traffic of the more than 50-year-old Magsaysay Bridge and create an alternate route. However, it was President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo who approved and implemented the project. The bridge was funded through a Special Yen Loan Package from Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). The project was started on May 6, 2004 and completed in May 2007.

* New Circumferential Road and Four New Bridges (Proposed): The new circumferential road consists of {{Convert|20|km}} 2-lane road and four new bridges that connects Barangay Sumilihon to Brgy Banza which crosses 2 small rivers (Taguibo and Banza) before crossing to the Third Bridge in Agusan River and connects to Barangay Pagatpatan to Barangay Lumbocan then crosses again in Masao River to reach Barangay Masao and Barangay Pinamanculan before connecting to the National Highway in Barangay Bancasi. The proposed circumferential road will be worth closed to PP2.9 Billion.
* Butuan-Malaybalay Road: The secondary road, known as the Butuan-Malaybalay Road, is scheduled to complete in the future connecting Butuan to [[Malaybalay]] via [[Esperanza, Agusan del Sur]] but this could be a private transport.
* Masao-Buenavista-Nasipit Coastal Road: The new coastal road (Masao-Buenavista-Nasipit) is scheduled to complete since it started construction in early 2015 until its completion by late 2023 (continued until 2027-2028) consisting of concrete road. It connects Brgy. Masao to the municipality of Nasipit, Agusan del Norte.
