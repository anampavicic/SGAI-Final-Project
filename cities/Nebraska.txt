'''Nebraska''' ({{IPAc-en|n|ə|ˈ|b|r|æ|s|k|ə|audio=en-us-Nebraska.ogg}} {{respell|nə|BRASS|kə}})<ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Nebraska|accessdate=2024-03-08}}</ref> is a landlocked [[U.S. state|state]] in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] region of the [[United States]]. It borders [[South Dakota]] to the north; [[Iowa]] to the east and [[Missouri]] to the southeast, both across the [[Missouri River]]; [[Kansas]] to the south; [[Colorado]] to the southwest; and [[Wyoming]] to the west. Nebraska is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|16th-largest state by land area]], with just over {{convert|77220|sqmi}}. With a population of over 1.9 million, it is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|38th-most populous state]] and the [[List of states and territories of the United States by population density|eighth-least densely populated]]. Its [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] is [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], and its [[List of municipalities in Nebraska|most populous city]] is [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], which is on the [[Missouri River]]. Nebraska was admitted into the United States in 1867, two years after the end of the [[American Civil War]]. The [[Nebraska Legislature]] is unlike any other American legislature in that it is [[unicameral]], and its members are elected without any official reference to [[Political parties in the United States|political party affiliation]]. Nebraska is one of only two states that divide electoral college votes by district, and is not winner-take-all.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-09-19 |title=Distribution of Electoral Votes |url=https://www.archives.gov/electoral-college/allocation |access-date=2024-09-17 |website=National Archives |language=en}}</ref>

Nebraska is composed of two major land regions: the [[Dissected Till Plains]] and the [[Great Plains]]. The Dissected Till Plains region consists of gently rolling hills and contains the state's largest cities, Omaha and Lincoln. The Great Plains region, occupying most of western Nebraska, is characterized by treeless [[prairie]]. Eastern Nebraska has a [[humid continental climate]] while western Nebraska is primarily [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]]. The state has wide variations between winter and summer temperatures; the variations decrease in southern Nebraska. Violent [[thunderstorm]]s and [[tornado]]es occur primarily during spring and summer, and sometimes in autumn. The [[Chinook wind]] tends to warm the state significantly in the winter and early spring.

Indigenous peoples, including [[Omaha people|Omaha]], [[Missouria]], [[Ponca]], [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], and various branches of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] ([[Sioux]]) tribes, lived in the region for thousands of years before [[Age of Discovery|European discovery and exploration]]. The state is crossed by many historic trails, including that of the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. The completion of the [[First transcontinental railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] through Nebraska and passage of the [[Homestead Acts]] led to rapid growth in the population of [[American pioneer|American settlers]] in the 1870s and 1880s and the development of a large agriculture sector for which the state is known to this day.

==Etymology==
Nebraska's name is the result of [[Anglicisation|anglicization]] of the archaic [[Chiwere language|Otoe]] {{Lang|iow|Ñí Brásge}} (contemporary Otoe: {{Lang|iow|Ñíbrahge}}; pronounced {{IPA-sio|ɲĩbɾasꜜkɛ|}}), or the [[Omaha–Ponca language|Omaha]] {{Lang|oma|Ní Btháska}}, (pronounced {{IPA-sio|nĩbɫᶞasꜜka|}}), meaning "flat water", after the [[Platte River]] which flows through the state.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://spot.colorado.edu/~koontz/faq/etymology.htm |title=Etymology |access-date=November 28, 2006 |author=Koontz, John |website=Siouan Languages |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512104157/http://spot.colorado.edu/~koontz/faq/etymology.htm |archive-date=May 12, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref>

{{Main|History of Nebraska}}
[[File:Nebraska 1718.jpg|thumb|Nebraska in 1718, [[Guillaume de L'Isle]] map, with the approximate area of the future state highlighted|left]]

=== Early history ===
[[Indigenous peoples]] lived in the region of present-day Nebraska for thousands of years before [[European colonization of the Americas|European colonization]]. The historic tribes in the state included the [[Omaha people|Omaha]], [[Missouria]], [[Ponca]], [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]], [[Otoe tribe|Otoe]], and various branches of the [[Lakota people|Lakota]] ([[Sioux]]), some of which migrated from eastern areas into the region. When European exploration, trade, and settlement began, both [[Spanish colonial empire|Spain]] and [[French colonial empire|France]] sought to control the region. In the 1690s, Spain established trade connections with the [[Apache people|Apache]], whose territory then included western Nebraska. By 1703, France had developed a regular trade with native peoples along the [[Missouri River]] in Nebraska, and by 1719 had signed treaties with several of these peoples. After war broke out between the two countries, Spain [[Villasur expedition|dispatched an armed expedition]] to Nebraska under Lieutenant General Pedro de Villasur in 1720. The party was attacked and destroyed near present-day [[Columbus, Nebraska|Columbus]] by a large force of Pawnee and Otoe, both allied with the French. The massacre ended Spanish exploration of the area for the remainder of the 18th century.<ref name="hanson">{{Cite journal |last=Hanson |first=James A |date=1993 |title=Spain on the Plains |url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/history/full-text/NH1993Spain.pdf |url-status=dead |journal=Nebraska History |volume=74 |pages=2–21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525202819/http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/history/full-text/NH1993Spain.pdf |archive-date=May 25, 2017 |accessdate=January 4, 2015 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0300/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0300/stories/0301_0113.html "Villasur Sent to Nebraska".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525202818/http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0300/frameset_reset.html?http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nebraskastudies.org%2F0300%2Fstories%2F0301_0113.html |date=May 25, 2017 }} [http://www.nebraskastudies.org/ Nebraskastudies.org.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010819183039/http://www.nebraskastudies.org/ |date=August 19, 2001 }} Retrieved January 4, 2015.</ref><ref>{{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20080210060051/http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/markers/texts/villasur_expedition_1720.htm "The Villasur expedition—1720".]}} {{usurped|1=[https://web.archive.org/web/20161129113841/http://nebraskahistory.org/archeo/pubs/Engineer%20Cantonment.pdf Nebraska State Historical Society.]}} Retrieved January 4, 2015.</ref>

In 1762, during the [[Seven Years' War]], France ceded the Louisiana territory to Spain. This left Britain and Spain competing for dominance along the Mississippi River; by 1773, the British were trading with the native peoples of Nebraska. Spain dispatched two trading expeditions up the Missouri River in 1794 and 1795; the second, under James Mackay, established the first European settlement in Nebraska near the mouth of the Platte River. Later that year, Mackay's party built a trading post, dubbed Fort Carlos IV (Fort Charles), near present-day [[Homer, Nebraska|Homer]].<ref name=hanson/><ref name=lociana>[https://www.loc.gov/collections/static/louisiana-european-explorations-and-the-louisiana-purchase/images/lapurchase.pdf "Louisiana: European explorations and the Louisiana Purchase".] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181002080050/http://www.loc.gov/collections/static/louisiana-european-explorations-and-the-louisiana-purchase/images/lapurchase.pdf |date=October 2, 2018 }} [https://www.loc.gov/ Library of Congress.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430175700/http://loc.gov/ |date=April 30, 2011 }} Retrieved January 4, 2015.</ref><ref name=charles>Wood, W.

=== American settlement and statehood ===
In 1819, the United States established [[Fort Atkinson (Nebraska)|Fort Atkinson]] as the first U.S. Army post west of the Missouri River, just east of present-day [[Fort Calhoun, Nebraska|Fort Calhoun]]. The army abandoned the fort in 1827 as migration moved further west. European-American settlement was scarce until 1848 and the [[California Gold Rush]].

'''<big>Late 19th century</big>'''

In the 1860s, after the U.S. government forced many of the [[Tribe (Native American)|American Indian tribes]] to cede their lands and settle on [[Indian reservation|reservations]], it opened large tracts of land to agricultural development by [[European emigration|European immigrants]] and [[American pioneer|American settlers]]. Under the [[Homestead Act]], thousands of settlers migrated into Nebraska to claim free land granted by the federal government. Because so few trees grew on the [[prairies]], many of the first farming settlers built their [[Sod house|homes of sod]], as had Native Americans such as the Omaha. The first wave of settlement gave the territory a sufficient population to apply for statehood.<ref>Marsha Hoffman and Dwight A.

During the 1870s to the 1880s, Nebraska experienced a large growth in population. Several factors contributed to attracting new residents. The first was that the vast prairie land was perfect for cattle grazing. This helped settlers to learn the unfamiliar geography of the area. The second factor was the invention of several farming technologies. New agricultural innovations such as barbed wire, windmills, and the steel plow, combined with fair weather, enabled settlers to transform Nebraska into prime farming land. By the 1880s, Nebraska's population had soared to more than 450,000 people.<ref>''Redbook''</ref> The [[Arbor Day]] holiday was founded in [[Nebraska City, Nebraska|Nebraska City]] by territorial governor [[J.

In the late 19th century, African Americans migrated from the South to Nebraska as part of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]]. Eventually, they lived primarily to [[Omaha]] which offered working-class jobs in [[Meat packing industry|meat packing]], the railroads and other industries. Omaha has a long history of [[Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska|civil rights]] activism. Blacks encountered discrimination from other Americans in Omaha and especially from recent European immigrants who were also competing for the same jobs as well.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Making Invisible Histories Visible / African American Migration to Omaha |url=https://www.ops.org/Page/http://www.ops.org/site/default.aspx?PageID=1659 |access-date=2024-04-10 |website=www.ops.org |language=en }}{{Dead link|date=May 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=== 20th century ===
During the early 20th century, In 1912, African Americans founded the Omaha chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] to work for improved conditions in the city and state. During the [[Omaha race riot of 1919|Omaha Race Riots in 1919]], many white rioters protested throughout Omaha due to there being an incident in which a black man was accused of sexually assaulting a white women. [[Great Depression|The Great Depression]] also had greatly affected the residents of Nebraska at the time. From 1930 to 1936 the dust bowl was common in the state due to there being a drought, wind, and dirt being dug up throughout all of the  [[Midwestern United States]]. Residents in Nebraska had passed an initiative in 1934, then the first session in the [[Unicameralism|unicameral]] was held in 1937.  [[Kay A. Orr|Kay Orr]] was elected Nebraska's first female governor on November 4, 1986.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1914-07-28 |title=Timeline of 20th century Nebraska |url=https://www.timetoast.com/timelines/timeline-of-20th-century-nebraska |access-date=2024-04-10 |website=Timetoast timelines |language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==

{{Further|List of counties in Nebraska|List of rivers of Nebraska|Geography of Omaha}}
[[File:National-atlas-nebraska.PNG|thumb|upright=1.2|A map of Nebraska]]

The state is bordered by [[South Dakota]] to the north; [[Iowa]] to the east and [[Missouri]] to the southeast, across the [[Missouri River]]; [[Kansas]] to the south; [[Colorado]] to the southwest; and [[Wyoming]] to the west. The state has [[List of counties in Nebraska|93 counties]] and is split between two [[time zone]]s, with the majority of the state observing [[Central Time Zone|Central Time]] and the [[Nebraska Panhandle|Panhandle]] and surrounding counties observing [[Mountain Time Zone|Mountain Time]]. Three rivers cross the state from west to east. The [[Platte River]], formed by the confluence of the [[North Platte River|North Platte]] and the [[South Platte River|South Platte]], runs through the state's central portion, the [[Niobrara River]] flows through the northern part, and the [[Republican River]] runs across the southern part.

The first Constitution of Nebraska in 1866 described Nebraska's boundaries as follows (The description of the Northern border is no longer accurate, since the [[Keya Paha River]] and the [[Niobrara River]] no longer form the boundary of the state of Nebraska. Instead, Nebraska's Northern border now extends east along the forty-third degree of north latitude until it meets the [[Missouri River]] directly.): {{Blockquote
|text=The State of Nebraska shall consist of all the territory included within the following boundaries, to-wit: Commencing at a point formed by the intersection of the western boundary of the State of Missouri, with the fortieth degree of north latitude; extending thence due west along said fortieth degree of north latitude, to a point formed by its intersection with the twenty-fifth degree of longitude west from Washington [the Southern border]; thence north along said twenty-fifth degree of longitude, to a point formed by its intersection with the forty-first degree of north latitude; thence west along said forty-first degree of north latitude to a point formed by its intersection with the twenty-seventh degree of longitude west from Washington; thence north along said twenty-seventh degree of west longitude, to a point formed by its intersection with the forty-third degree of north latitude [the Western border, which is the Panhandle]; thence east along said forty-third degree of north latitude to the Keya Paha river; thence down the middle of the channel of said river, with its meanderings, to its junction with the Niobrara River; thence down the middle of the channel of said Niobrara River, and following the meanderings thereof to its junction with the Missouri River [the Northern border]; thence down the middle of the channel of said Missouri River, and following the meanderings thereof to the place of beginning [the Eastern border, which is the Missouri River].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nebraskalegislature.gov/pdf/reports/research/constitution2017.pdf |title=The Nebraska Constitution, 1866–2016 |publisher=Nebraska Legislature, Legislative Research Office |date=February 2017 |access-date=June 22, 2020 |archive-date=October 17, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201017114600/https://nebraskalegislature.gov/pdf/reports/research/constitution2017.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>}}

Nebraska is composed of two major land regions: the [[Dissected Till Plains]] and the [[Great Plains]]. The easternmost portion of the state was scoured by [[Ice age|Ice Age]] [[glacier]]s; the Dissected Till Plains were left after the glaciers retreated. The Dissected Till Plains is a region of gently rolling hills; [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] and [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] are in this region. The Great Plains occupy most of western Nebraska, with the region consisting of several smaller, diverse land regions, including the [[Sandhills (Nebraska)|Sandhills]], the [[Pine Ridge (region)|Pine Ridge]], the [[Rainwater Basin]], the [[High Plains (United States)|High Plains]] and the [[Wildcat Hills]]. [[Panorama Point]], at {{Convert|5424|ft|}}, is Nebraska's highest point; though despite its name and elevation, it is a relatively low rise near the [[Colorado]] and [[Wyoming]] borders. A past tourism slogan for the state of Nebraska was "Where the West Begins" (it has since been changed to "Honestly, it's not for everyone").<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/18/honestly-its-not-for-everyone-says-nebraskas-self-deprecating-new-tourism-campaign |title='Honestly, it's not for everyone,' says Nebraska's self-deprecating new tourism campaign |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |access-date=October 18, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018000759/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/10/18/honestly-its-not-for-everyone-says-nebraskas-self-deprecating-new-tourism-campaign/ |archive-date=October 18, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Locations given for the beginning of the "West" in Nebraska include the Missouri River, the intersection of 13th and O Streets in Lincoln (where it is marked by a red brick star), the [[100th meridian west|100th meridian]], and [[Chimney Rock National Historic Site|Chimney Rock]].

Two major climatic zones are represented in Nebraska. The eastern two-thirds of the state has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa''), although the southwest of this region may be classed as a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') using the {{convert|−3|C|F|1|disp=or}}  near the Kansas state line, analogous to the predominantly [[humid subtropical]] climate of Kansas and [[Oklahoma]]. Western Nebraska, including [[Nebraska Panhandle|The Panhandle]] and adjacent areas bordering Colorado have a [[semi-arid climate]] (Köppen ''BSk''). The entire state experiences wide seasonal variations in both temperature and precipitation. Average temperatures are fairly uniform across Nebraska, with hot summers and generally cold winters. However, [[chinook wind]]s from the [[Rocky Mountains]] provide a temporary moderating effect on temperatures in the state's western portion during the winter.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nebraskaclimateoffice.unl.edu/weather.summary.Dec99 |title=Nebraska Climate Office {{pipe}} Applied Climate Science {{pipe}} SNR {{pipe}} UNL |publisher=Nebraskaclimateoffice.unl.edu |date=July 23, 2009 |access-date=April 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207190107/http://www.nebraskaclimateoffice.unl.edu/weather.summary.Dec99 |archive-date=December 7, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tcdne.org/climate.htm |title=Climate—Twin Cities Development Association, Inc.—Nebraska: Scottsbluff, Gering, TerryTown, Mitchell, Bayard |publisher=Tcdne.org |access-date=February 24, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090604023754/http://www.tcdne.org/climate.htm |archive-date=June 4, 2009 }}</ref> Thus, average January maximum temperatures are highest at around {{convert|43|F|C|1|disp=or}} in southwestern [[Dundy County, Nebraska|Dundy County]], and lowest at about {{convert|30|F|C|1|disp=or}} around [[South Sioux City, Nebraska|South Sioux City]] in the northeast.

Average annual precipitation decreases east to west from about {{Convert|31.5|in}} in the southeast corner of the state to about {{Convert|13.8|in}} in the Panhandle.

Nebraska is located in [[Tornado Alley]]. [[Thunderstorm]]s are common during both the spring and the summer. Violent thunderstorms and [[tornado]]es happen primarily during those two seasons, although they also can occur occasionally during the autumn.

[[File:Nebraska population map.png|thumb|upright=1.15|alt=Map of state: mostly one to twenty-five people per square mile, with density increasing as one moves eastward|Population density in Nebraska]]

Eighty-nine percent of the cities in Nebraska have fewer than 3,000 people. Nebraska shares this characteristic with five other Midwestern states: [[Kansas]], [[Oklahoma]], [[North Dakota]] and [[South Dakota]], and [[Iowa]]. Hundreds of towns have a population of fewer than 1,000. Regional population declines have forced many rural schools to consolidate.

Fifty-three of Nebraska's 93 counties reported declining populations between 1990 and 2000, ranging from a 0.06% loss ([[Frontier County, Nebraska|Frontier County]]) to a 17.04% loss ([[Hitchcock County, Nebraska|Hitchcock County]]).
[[File:Downtown Omaha from the North at Night.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Omaha, Nebraska's largest city]]

More urbanized areas of the state have experienced substantial growth. In 2000, the city of [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]] had a population of 390,007; in 2005, the city's estimated population was 414,521 (427,872 including the recently annexed city of [[Elkhorn, Nebraska|Elkhorn]]), a 6.3% increase over five years. The 2010 census showed that Omaha has a population of 408,958. The city of [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] had a 2000 population of 225,581 and a 2010 population of 258,379, a 14.5% increase.

Nebraska has been the nation's second-largest producer of ethanol [[biofuel]]s.

It hosts one uranium leach mining operation near its northwest border with Wyoming.  It has an abundance of renewable generation resources, including untapped biomass generation potential from its productive agriculture industry. It has been a top-ten state for per-capita energy consumption due in large part to its energy-intensive agriculture, meat packing, and food processing industries.<ref name=eiapro>{{cite web |url=https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=NE |title=Nebraska Electricity Profile Analysis |publisher=U.S. EIA |access-date=2021-03-11 |archive-date=March 20, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210320210313/https://www.eia.gov/state/analysis.php?sid=NE |url-status=live }}</ref>

Nebraska's Legislature is also the only [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] in the United States that is officially [[Non-partisan democracy|nonpartisan]]. The senators are elected with no party affiliation next to their names on the ballot, and members of any party can be elected to the positions of speaker and committee chairs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nebraska Legislature - on Unicameralism |url=https://nebraskalegislature.gov/about/ou_facts.php |website=nebraskalegislature.gov |access-date=26 April 2022 |archive-date=April 26, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220426192629/https://nebraskalegislature.gov/about/ou_facts.php |url-status=live }}</ref> The Nebraska Legislature can also override the governor's veto with a three-fifths majority, in contrast to the two-thirds majority required in some other states.

When Nebraska became a state in 1867, its legislature consisted of two houses: a House of Representatives and a Senate. For years, U.S. Senator [[George W. Norris|George Norris]] (Senator 1913–1943) and other Nebraskans encouraged the idea of a unicameral legislature and demanded the issue be decided in a [[referendum]]. Norris argued:<ref name="Unicameral History" />
{{blockquote|The constitutions of our various states are built upon the idea that there is but one class. If this be true, there is no sense or reason in having the same thing done twice, especially if it is to be done by two bodies of men elected in the same way and having the same jurisdiction.}} Unicameral supporters also argued that a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] legislature had a significant undemocratic feature in the committees that reconciled House and Senate legislation. Votes in these committees were secretive, and would sometimes add provisions to bills that neither house had approved.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nebraska Legislature |url=https://nebraskalegislature.gov/about/ou_experience.php |website=nebraskalegislature.gov |access-date=26 April 2022 |archive-date=April 26, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220426192630/https://nebraskalegislature.gov/about/ou_experience.php |url-status=live }}</ref> Nebraska's unicameral legislature today has rules that bills can contain only one subject,<ref>{{cite web |title=Nebraska Legislature |url=https://nebraskalegislature.gov/about/lawmaking.php |website=nebraskalegislature.gov |access-date=26 April 2022 |archive-date=April 26, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220426192630/https://nebraskalegislature.gov/about/lawmaking.php |url-status=live }}</ref> and must be given at least five days of consideration. In 1934, due in part to the budgetary pressure of the [[Great Depression]], Nebraska citizens ran a state initiative to vote on a constitutional amendment creating a unicameral legislature, which was approved, which, in effect, abolished the House of Representatives (the lower house).<ref name="Unicameral History" />

The Legislature meets in the third [[Nebraska State Capitol]] building, built between 1922 and 1932. It was designed by [[Bertram Goodhue|Bertram G. Goodhue]]. Built from Indiana limestone, the capitol's base is a cross within a square. A 400-foot (122 m) domed tower rises from this base. The Sower, a 19-foot (5.8 m) bronze statue representing agriculture, crowns the building.

===Politics===
{{Further|Political party strength in Nebraska}}

For most of its history, Nebraska has been a solidly [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] state. Republicans have carried the state in all but one presidential election since [[1940 United States presidential election|1940]]: the [[1964 United States presidential election|1964 landslide election]] of [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. In the [[2004 United States presidential election|2004 presidential election]], [[George W. Bush]] won the state's five electoral votes by a margin of 33 percentage points (making Nebraska's the fourth-strongest Republican vote among states) with 65.9% of the overall vote; only [[Thurston County, Nebraska|Thurston County]], which is majority-[[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], voted for his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger [[John Kerry]]. In [[2008 United States presidential election|2008]], the state split its electoral votes for the first time: Republican [[John McCain]] won the popular vote in Nebraska as a whole and two of its three congressional districts; the second district, which includes the city of Omaha, went for Democrat [[Barack Obama]]. Since then, the state has split its electoral vote once, with the second district going for Democrat [[Joe Biden]] in [[2020 United States presidential election|2020]].

Despite the current Republican domination of Nebraska politics, the state has a long tradition of electing [[Centrism|centrist]] members of both parties to state and federal office; examples include [[George W. Norris]] (who served a few years in the Senate as an independent), [[J. James Exon]], [[Bob Kerrey]], and [[Chuck Hagel]]. Voters have tilted to the right in recent years, a trend evidenced when Hagel retired from the Senate in 2008 and was succeeded by conservative Republican [[Mike Johanns]] to the U.S. Senate, as well as with the 2006 re-election of [[Ben Nelson]], who was considered the most conservative Democrat in the Senate until his retirement in 2013. Johanns retired in 2015 and was succeeded by [[Ben Sasse]], while Nelson retired in 2013 and was succeeded by [[Deb Fischer]], both conservative Republicans.

Though its politics are generally conservative, the state also has a history of progressive reform. Nebraska was the first U.S. state to [[Marital rape in the United States|outlaw sexual assault within a marriage]], in 1975.<ref name="Polisi">{{cite web |last1=Johnston Polisi |first1=Caroline |title=Spousal Rape Laws Continue to Evolve |url=https://womensenews.org/2009/07/spousal-rape-laws-continue-evolve/ |website=[[Women's eNews]] |access-date=June 6, 2021 |date=July 1, 2009 |archive-date=June 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625071249/https://womensenews.org/2009/07/spousal-rape-laws-continue-evolve/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1980 it became the first U.S. state to [[Disinvestment from South Africa|divest from South Africa]] to protest the racist system of [[apartheid]].<ref name="Lansing1981">{{cite journal |last=Lansing |first=Paul |date=1981 |title=The Divestment of United States Companies in South Africa and Apartheid |url=https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2025&context=nlr |journal=Nebraska Law Review |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=301 |access-date=June 6, 2021 |archive-date=June 6, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210606202851/https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2025&context=nlr |url-status=live }}</ref>

Former President [[Gerald Ford]] was born in Nebraska but moved away shortly after birth. [[Illinois]] native [[William Jennings Bryan]] represented Nebraska in Congress, served as [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] under President [[Woodrow Wilson]], and unsuccessfully ran for president three times. Former Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] was born in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]] but moved to  [[Casper, Wyoming|Casper]].
