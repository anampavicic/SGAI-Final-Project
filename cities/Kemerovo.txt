'''Kemerovo''' ({{lang-rus|Ке́мерово|p=ˈkʲemʲɪrəvə}}) is an industrial [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] and the [[administrative center]] of [[Kemerovo Oblast]], [[Russia]], located at the [[confluence]] of the [[Iskitimka River|Iskitimka]] and [[Tom River]]s, in the major [[coal mining]] region of the [[Kuznetsk Basin]].

The city was known as ''Shcheglovsk'' until March 27, 1932.<ref name="EstablishedRenamed" />

==History==
Kemerovo is an amalgamation of, and successor to, several older Russian settlements. A waypoint named Verkhotomsky ''ostrog'' was established nearby in 1657 on a road from [[Tomsk]] to [[Kuznetsk fortress]]. In 1701, the settlement of [[Shcheglovsk]] was founded on the left bank of the Tom; soon it became a village. By 1859, seven villages existed where modern Kemerovo is now: Shcheglovka (or Ust-Iskitimskoye), Kemerovo (named in 1734), Yevseyevo, Krasny Yar, Kur-Iskitim (Pleshki), Davydovo (Ishanovo), and Borovaya. In 1721, coal was discovered in the area. The first coal mines were established in 1907, later a chemical plant was established in 1916. By 1917, the population of Shcheglovo had grown to around 4,000&nbsp;people.

The area's further development was boosted by the construction of a railway between [[Yurga]] and Kolchugino (now [[Leninsk-Kuznetsky (city)|Leninsk-Kuznetsky]]) with a connection between [[Topki (town), Kemerovo Oblast|Topki]] and Shcheglovo. Shcheglovo was granted town status on May&nbsp;9, 1918, which is now considered to be the date of Kemerovo's founding;<ref name="EstablishedRenamed">Charter of Kemerovo, Article&nbsp;1</ref> and was later known as '''Shcheglovsk'''. The town became the central location for the [[Kuzbass Autonomous Industrial Colony]] which was established there in 1921. 650 workers from 20 countries settled there and set up what became the [[Kemerovo Coke Chemical Plant]]. Some of their descendants visited the modern factory in 2011.<ref name="Koks">{{cite web|title=Descendants of Dutch colonists visit OAO Koks|url=http://www.koksgroup.ru/en/press-center/release/308/|website=www.koksgroup.ru|publisher=KOKS group|access-date=16 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220182314/http://www.koksgroup.ru/en/press-center/release/308/|archive-date=December 20, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> On May&nbsp;27, 1932, Shcheglovsk was renamed Kemerovo<ref name="EstablishedRenamed" /> and became the administrative center of Kemerovo Oblast in 1943.

== Etymology ==
The city was named after the village of Kemerovo, named after the surname of the first settlers of the Kemerovs. The ending "ovo" suggests a toponymic transition through a personal name.<ref>Мурзаев Э. М. ''Словарь народных географических терминов''. М.: 1984 — С. 248</ref> The village gave its name to the Kemerovo mine that arose under it. In 1925, the city of Scheglovsk was formed from two neighboring villages Kemerovo and Scheglovo, which in 1932 was renamed to Kemerovo after the name of the mine. According to another version, the name is based on the Turkic word ''kemer'' - "cliff, coast, cliff".<ref>''[[Мурзаев, Эдуард Макарович|Мурзаев Э. М.]], Мурзаева В. Э.''
