'''Suleja''' is a city in [[Niger State]], [[Nigeria]], just north of [[Abuja]], capital of the Nigeria. It is sometimes confused with the nearby city of [[Abuja]], due to its proximity, and the fact that it was originally called [[Abuja]] before the Nigerian government adopted the name from the then [[Emir]] [[Sulaymān Baal|Sulayman Bal]] for its new federal capital in 1976.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Niger State (Nigeria).

==History==
The emirate's wooded savanna area of about {{convert|2980|km2}} originally included four small [[Koro Zuba language|Koro]] [[chiefdom]]s that paid tribute to the Hausa kingdom of Zazzau.{{citation needed|date=September 2022}} After warriors of the Fulani jihad (struggle/War) captured [[Zaria]] (Zazzau's capital, {{convert|220|km|abbr=on}} north-northeast) about 1804, Muhamman Makau, sarkin ("king of") Zazzau, led many of the Hausa nobility to the Koro town of [[Zuba, Nigeria|Zuba]] ({{convert|10|km|abbr=on|disp=or|0}} south). Abu Ja (Jatau), his brother and successor as sarkin Zazzau, founded Abuja town in 1828, began construction of its wall a year later, and proclaimed himself the first Sarkin Abuja.

Withstanding Zaria attacks, the Abuja emirate remained an independent Hausa refuge.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Abu Ja {{!}} king of Zazzau {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Abu-Ja |access-date=2022-09-01 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> Trade with the Fulani emirates of [[Bida Emirate|Bida]] (to the west) and Zaria began in Emir Abu Kwaka's reign (1851–1877), but, when Abuja's leaders disrupted the trade route between [[Lokoja]] ({{convert|160|km|abbr=on|disp=or}} south-southeast) and Zaria in 1902, the British occupied the town. Alluvial [[tin]] mining began in Emir Musa Angulu's reign (1917–1944).

In 2011, Suleja was hit by several bomb assaults. Ten people were killed on March 3.<ref>[http://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/03/10-feared-dead-in-bomb-blast-in-suleja-in-niger/ 10 feared dead in Suleja bomb blast], Vanguard, visited April 16, 2011</ref> On April 7, another bomb killed 25 people.<ref>[http://thewillnigeria.com/breaking/8159-Bomb-Explosion-INEC-Office-Suleja.html Bomb Explosion At INEC Office In Suleja], THEWILL, visited April 16, 2011</ref>
