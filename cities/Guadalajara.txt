On November 8, 1539, the [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Charles V]] had granted a coat of arms and the title of city to the new town and established it as the capital of the [[Nueva Galicia|Kingdom of Nueva Galicia]], part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]]. After 1572, the [[Royal Audiencia of Guadalajara]], previously subordinate to [[Mexico City]], became the only authority in New Spain with autonomy over Nueva Galicia, owing to rapidly growing wealth in the kingdom following the discovery of [[silver]]. By the 18th century, Guadalajara had taken its place as Mexico's second largest city, following mass colonial migrations in the 1720s and 1760s. During the [[Mexican War of Independence]], independence leader {{lang|es|[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]|italic=no}} established Mexico's first revolutionary government in Guadalajara in 1810. The city flourished during the {{lang|es|[[Porfiriato]]}} (1876–1911), with the advent of the [[industrial revolution]], but its growth was hampered significantly during the [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–1920). In 1929, the [[Cristero War]] ended within the confines of the city, when President {{lang|es|[[Plutarco Elías Calles]]|italic=no}} proclaimed the {{lang|es|Grito de Guadalajara}}. The city saw continuous growth throughout the rest of the 20th century, attaining a metro population of 1&nbsp;million in the 1960s and surpassing 3&nbsp;million in the 1990s.

== Etymology ==

The conquistador {{lang|es|[[Cristóbal de Oñate]]|italic=no}} named the city in honor of the conqueror of western Mexico, {{lang|es|[[Nuño de Guzmán]]|italic=no}}, who was born in {{lang|es|[[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]]|italic=no}}, [[Spain]], which is derived from [[Andalusi Arabic|Moorish Arabic]] {{lang|ar|وادي الحجارة}} ({{lang|ar-Latn|wādī al-ḥajārah}}), which means 'Valley of the Stones', or 'Fortress Valley'.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Guadalajara}}

=== Pre-Hispanic era ===

Unlike the surrounding areas, the central Atemajac Valley (where Guadalajara is located) contained no human settlements.{{Citation needed|date=October 2022}} To the east of the Atemajac Valley were the Tonallan and Tetlán peoples. At the extremes were the Zapopan, Atemajac, Zoquipan, Tesistan, Coyula, and Huentitán.

The historic city center encompasses what was once four population centers, as the villages of the Mezquitán, Analco, and Mexicaltzingo were annexed to the Atemajac site in 1669.<ref name="encmuc"/>

=== Foundation ===
{{main|Nueva Galicia|Royal Audiencia of Guadalajara}}
[[File:La amazona del Teatro Degollado (cropped).jpg|left|thumb|Monument to Beatriz Hernández, one of the founders of Guadalajara]]
Guadalajara was originally founded at three other sites before moving to its current location. The first colonial settlement in 1532 was in Mesa del Cerro, now known as [[Nochistlán]], Zacatecas. This site was colonized by [[Cristóbal de Oñate]] as commissioned by [[Nuño de Guzmán]], with the purpose of securing recent conquests and "defending" them from the "still-hostile natives". This colonized settlement did not last long due to its lack of usable water sources. In 1533 it was moved to a site near [[Tonalá, Jalisco|Tonalá]]. Four years later, Guzmán ordered that the village be moved to Tlacotán. During this time, the Spanish king [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I]] granted the city the coat of arms which it retains to this day.<ref name="encmuc">{{cite web |url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/jalisco/mpios/14039a.htm |title=Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Jalisco Guadalajara |publisher=[[Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal]] |language=es |access-date=January 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616184414/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/jalisco/mpios/14039a.htm |archive-date=June 16, 2011 }}</ref>

During the [[Mixtón War]] (1540–1542), the [[Caxcan]], Portecuex, and [[Zacateco]] peoples, fought back against colonizers under the command of [[Tenamaxtli]].<ref name="encmuc"/> The war was initiated in response to the heinous treatment of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] by Nuño de Guzmán, in particular the enslavement of captured natives. After multiple defeats, [[Viceroy]] [[Antonio de Mendoza]] took control of the Spanish campaign to suppress the revolt. The conflict ended after Mendoza made concessions such as freeing enslaved indigenous peoples and granting amnesty.<ref name="kirkwood62">{{cite book |title=History of Mexico |last=Kirkwood |first=Burton |year=2000 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing |location=Westport, Connecticut |page=62 |url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/itesm/Doc?id=10017942&ppg=80 |access-date=January 13, 2010 |archive-date=25 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925164300/https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/auth/lib/itesm-ebooks/login.action?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Febookcentral.proquest.com%2Flib%2Fitesm-ebooks%2Fdetail.action%3FdocID%3D3000600%26ppg%3D80 |url-status=live }}</ref> The village of Guadalajara barely survived the war, and the villagers attributed their survival to the [[Archangel Michael]], who remains the patron of the city to this day.

After the war, the city was moved once again—this time to a more defensible location. This final relocation would prove permanent. In 1542, records indicate that 126 people were living in Guadalajara. That same year, it was granted cityhood by the king of Spain. Guadalajara was officially founded on February 14, 1542, in the Atemajac Valley. The colonized settlement was named for Nuño de Guzmán's [[Guadalajara, Castilla–La Mancha|Spanish hometown]].<ref name="encmuc"/>

In 1559, royal and [[diocese|bishopric]] offices for the province of [[Nueva Galicia]] were moved from [[Compostela, Nayarit|Compostela]] to Guadalajara and, in 1560, Guadalajara became the province's new capital. Construction of the cathedral began in 1563. In 1575, religious orders such as the [[Augustinians]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] arrived, eventually making the city a center for evangelization efforts.<ref name="encmuc"/>

While capital of the Kingdom of Nueva Galicia, the city's inhabitants achieved a high standard of living, due to flourishing industry, agriculture, commerce, mining, and trade. The Guadalajara of the 16th century was a rather small and often overlooked community. It was mainly frequented by traveling merchants. Several epidemics drastically reduced the city's indigenous population, leading to the construction of its first hospital in 1557.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Carlos Regino Villalobos Espinosa |date=December 2022 |title=Moving forward: the democratization of social policy in Jalisco |url=https://journalofpublicgovernance.cucea.udg.mx/index.php/jpgp/article/view/7688 |journal=Journal of Public Governance and Policy: Latin American Review |volume=1 |issue=11 |pages=4 |via=Universidad de Guadalajara}}</ref>

Guadalajara's economy during the 18th century was based on agriculture and the production of non-durable goods such as textiles, shoes and food products.<ref name="napolitano21">{{cite book |title=Migration, Mujercitas, and Medicine Men&thinsp;: Living in Urban Mexico |last=Napolitano |first=Valentina |year=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Ewing, New Jersey |page=21 |url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/itesm/Doc?id=10050807&ppg=37 |access-date=January 13, 2010 |archive-date=25 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925164300/https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/auth/lib/itesm-ebooks/login.action?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Febookcentral.proquest.com%2Flib%2Fitesm-ebooks%2Fdetail.action%3FdocID%3D224152%26ppg%3D37 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Despite epidemics, plagues, and earthquakes, Guadalajara would become one of the most important population centers in [[New Spain]].
The city's heyday attracted numerous architects, philosophers, lawyers, scientists, poets, writers, and speakers; [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]] and {{ill|Matías Ángel de la Mota Padilla|es}} were among the most prominent. In 1771, Bishop Fray Antonio Alcalde arrived in the city and founded the Civil Hospital and the [[University of Guadalajara]]. In 1791, the University of Guadalajara was established. The dedication was held in 1792 at the site of the old Santo Tomas College. While the institution was founded during the 18th century, it would not be fully developed until the 20th century, starting in 1925. In 1794, the {{ill|Hospital Real de San Miguel de Belén|es|Hospital Civil de Guadalajara}}, or simply the Hospital de Belén, was opened.<ref name="encmuc" />

In 1793, [[Mariano Valdés Téllez Giron]] ran the city's first printing press, whose first publication was a funeral eulogy for Fray Antonio Alcalde.

=== Independence ===

[[File:Nebel Voyage 42 Guadalajara.jpg|thumb|left|Guadalajara, {{circa|1836}}]]

Throughout the twentieth century, seeing growth in its industrial, tourist, and service industries, Guadalajara began a period of rapid transformation into the metropolis it is today. The city would gain the second largest economy in Mexico, following only by [[Mexico City]]. After the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910, Guadalajara became the second most populous city in the country. However, the decades that followed brought a number of regional wars in the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Michoacán]], and [[Guanajuato]]. The aftermath of the [[Great Depression in Latin America|Great Depression]] took a further toll on the city. Fortunately, by the 1940s the city would experience industrial, demographic, and trade growth.

In 1910, the Mexican Revolution began, bringing an end to the {{lang|es|[[Porfiriato]]}}. With conflict concentrated in the capital, Guadalajara experienced relative calm. After the Cristero Conflict, peace returned to Guadalajara and the city flourished, outgrowing its colonial roots. This period saw the birth of new schools of architecture that would decorate the city from the 1920s to the 1980s.

Guadalajara again experienced substantial growth after the 1930s,<ref name="brittanica">{{cite web |url=http://0-search.eb.com.millenium.itesm.mx/eb/article-256635 |title=Guadalajara |year=2010 |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica.

The increase in population brought with it an increase in the size of what is now called Greater Guadalajara, rather than an increase in the population density of the city. Migrants coming into Guadalajara from the 1940s to the 1980s were mostly from rural areas and lived in the city center until they had enough money to buy property. This property was generally bought in the edges of the city, which were urbanizing into {{lang|es|fraccionamientos}}, or residential areas.<ref name="napolitano2324">{{cite book |title=Migration, Mujercitas, and Medicine Men&thinsp;: Living in Urban Mexico |last=Napolitano |first=Valentina |year=2002 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Ewing, New Jersey |pages=23–24 |url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/itesm/Doc?id=10050807&ppg=3 |access-date=January 13, 2010 |archive-date=25 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925164927/https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/auth/lib/itesm-ebooks/login.action?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Febookcentral.proquest.com%2Flib%2Fitesm-ebooks%2Fdetail.action%3FdocID%3D224152%26ppg%3D3 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the 1980s, it was described as a "divided city" east to west based on socioeconomic class.

Since 1996, the activity of multinational corporations has had a significant effect on the economic and social development of the city. The presence of companies such as [[Kodak]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Motorola]] and [[IBM]] has been based on production facilities built outside the city proper, bringing in foreign labor and capital. This was made possible in the 1980s by surplus labor, infrastructure improvements, and government incentives. These companies focus on electrical and electronic items, which is now one of Guadalajara's two main products (the other being beer). This has internationalized the economy, steering it away from manufacturing and toward services, dependent on technology and foreign investment. This has not been favorable for the unskilled working class and traditional labor sectors.<ref name="napolitano2022">{{cite book |title=Migration, Mujercitas, and Medicine Men&thinsp;: Living in Urban Mexico |last=Napolitano |first=Valentina |year= 2002 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Ewing, New Jersey |pages=20, 22 |url=http://site.ebrary.com/lib/itesm/Doc?id=10050807&ppg=37 |access-date=January 13, 2010 |archive-date=25 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925164300/https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/auth/lib/itesm-ebooks/login.action?returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Febookcentral.proquest.com%2Flib%2Fitesm-ebooks%2Fdetail.action%3FdocID%3D224152%26ppg%3D37 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Three days before the explosion, residents started complaining of a strong [[gasoline]]-like smell coming from the sewers. City workers were dispatched to check the sewers and found dangerously high levels of gasoline fumes. However, no evacuations were ordered. An investigation into the disaster found that there were two precipitating causes. The first was new water pipes that were built too close to an existing gasoline pipeline. Chemical reactions between the pipes caused erosion. The second was a flaw in the sewer design that did not allow accumulated gases to escape.<ref name="semp">{{cite web |url=http://www.semp.us/publications/biot_reader.php?BiotID=356 |title=The Guadalajara 1992 Sewer Gas Explosion Disaster |date=3 May 2006 |publisher=SEMP |location=Massachusetts |access-date=January 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210235229/http://www.semp.us/publications/biot_reader.php?BiotID=356 |archive-date=10 February 2009 }}</ref>

== Geography ==

=== Climate ===

[[File:Guadalajara, Jalisco, México 19.0.jpg|thumb|left|Parque de los Jalicienses Ilustres]]
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Guadalajara has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa''), a temperate climate that is quite close to a tropical climate, featuring dry warm winters and wet, mildly hot summers. Guadalajara's climate is influenced by its high altitude and the general seasonality of precipitation patterns in western North America.

Although the temperature is warm year-round, Guadalajara has strong seasonal variation in precipitation. The northward movement of the [[Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone]] brings a great deal of rain in the summer months, whereas, for the rest of the year, the climate is rather dry, although daily rainfall records in each dry season month range from {{convert|36|mm|in|1|sp=us}} to {{convert|75|mm|in|1|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=smn.conagua.gob.mx/tools/RESOURCES/Max-Extr/00014/00014066.TXT |url=https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/tools/RESOURCES/Max-Extr/00014/00014066.TXT |website=Servicio Meteorológico Nacional|access-date=21 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230617114529/https://smn.conagua.gob.mx/tools/RESOURCES/Max-Extr/00014/00014066.TXT |archive-date=17 June 2023 |language=es |url-status=live}}</ref>  The extra moisture during the wet months moderates the temperatures, resulting in cooler days and nights during this period. The highest temperatures are usually reached in May averaging {{convert|33|°C|0|abbr=on}}, but can reach up to {{convert|37|°C|0|abbr=on}} just before the onset of monsoon season. March tends to be the driest month and July the wettest, with an average of {{convert|273|mm|in|1|sp=us}} of rain, over a quarter of the annual average of about {{convert|1002|mm|in|1|sp=us}}.

During the summer, afternoon storms are very common and can sometimes bring [[hail]] flurries to the city, especially toward late August or September. Winters are relatively warm despite the city's altitude, with January daytime temperatures reaching about {{convert|25|°C|0|abbr=on}} and nighttime temperatures about {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}}. However, the outskirts of the city (generally those close to the Primavera Forest) experience on average cooler temperatures than the city itself. There, temperatures around {{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}} can be recorded during the coldest nights. Frost may also occur during the coldest nights, but temperatures rarely fall below {{convert|0|°C|0|abbr=on}} in the city, making it an uncommon phenomenon. Cold fronts in winter can sometimes bring light rain to the city for several days in a row. Snowfall is extraordinarily rare, with the last recorded one occurring in December 1997, which was the first time in 116 years, as it had previously last fallen in 1881.<ref name=EC>{{cite web|url = http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=3AA35C31-1#t1|title = El Niño Arrives on Schedule|publisher = Environment Canada|access-date = February 2, 2013|date = 2009-12-23|archive-date = 14 January 2014|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140114070550/http://www.ec.gc.ca/meteo-weather/default.asp?lang=En&n=3AA35C31-1#t1|url-status = live}}</ref>

=== Topography ===

[[File:Cascada, Barranca de Huentitlan, Jalisco - panoramio (4).jpg|thumb|The [[Barranca de Huentitán]]]]
Guadalajara's natural wealth is represented by the [[La Primavera Forest]], [[Los Colomos]], and the [[Barranca de Huentitán]]. The flora in these areas includes michoacan pines, several species of oak, sweetgum, ash, willow, and introduced trees such as poincianas, jacarandas, and ficus. It also includes orchids, roses, and various species of fungi. The fauna includes typical urban fauna in addition to 106 species of mammals, 19 species of reptiles, and six species of fish.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

La [[Barranca de Huentitán]] (the Huentitán Forest) (also known as Barranca de Oblatos and Barranca de Oblatos-Huentitán) is a National Park located just north of the municipality of Guadalajara. The barranca (canyon) borders two colonias (neighborhoods) of the city, Oblatos and Huentitan.
It covers approximately {{Convert|1,136|ha|acre}}, and varies {{Convert|600|m|ft|sp=us}} in altitude. The funicular railway in the park starts at {{Convert|1000|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level and rises to {{Convert|1520|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level. In the 16th century, during the Spanish Conquest, the Huentitán area including the canyon was the site of battles between local Indian populations and the Spanish. Later, it was the site of battles between different factions during the [[Mexican Revolution]] and the [[Cristero Rebellion]].

[[File:20 de noviembre de zapopan.jpg|thumb|left|Parque 20 de Noviembre, [[Zapopan]]]]
The canyon is a biogeographic corridor that is home to four types of vegetation: deciduous tropical forest, gallery forest, heath vegetation, and secondary vegetation. In addition to introduced species, there are many native species of flora and fauna. The canyon is studied by national and international researchers as it contains great biological diversity due to its geographical location.
On June 5, 1997, it was declared a Protected Natural Area, as an Area Subject to Ecological Conservation (Zona Sujeta a Conservación Ecológica).

La Cascada Cola de Caballo (The Horse Tail Waterfall) is located on the Guadalajara to Zacatecas road (Highway 54, km 15) a few kilometers from the Northern Peripheral, just after passing the village of San Esteban. The waterfall is fed by a stream from the Atemajac Valley. It is close to Guadalajara and a town with very little development, and as a result of poor ecological practices, it is very polluted.

El Bosque los Colomos, the Colomos Forest, is located in the northwestern part of Guadalajara along the Rio Atemajac. It is in a wealthy part of the metropolitan area, and has been developed for recreation rather than being preserved in its wild state. The river was once one of the main sources of water supply to the city, and today continues to provide water to some surrounding colonias (neighborhoods). Currently, this forest covers an area of {{Convert|92|ha|acre}} in which pine trees, eucalyptus trees, and cedars predominate. The park has jogging tracks, gardens (including a Japanese garden), ponds, a bird lake, instructional areas for school field days, playgrounds, camping areas, and horses to ride.

Other places of interest around Guadalajara include Camachos Aquatic Natural Park, a commercial water park, and Barranca Colimilla, a beautiful canyon with hiking trails near Tonala, east of Guadalajara.

=== Urbanism ===

[[File:Panorámica Guadalajara desde edificio Bansi hacia sur.jpg|thumb|Radial urban planning in central Guadalajara]]
[[File:Zonas de Guadalajara.svg|thumb|Map of the city's zones]]
[[File:Plaza de armas de Guadalajara.jpg|thumb|Street in the historic center]]
Guadalajara's street plan has evolved over time into a [[urban planning|radial urban plan]], with five major routes into and out of the city. It is surrounded by ring roads.

The original city of Guadalajara was planned on a grid, with north–south and east–west intersecting streets.
Over time, villages surrounding Guadalajara were incorporated into the city - first Analco to the southeast, then Mexicaltzingo to the south, Mezquitan to the north, and San Juan de Dios to the east, all of which introduced more variety to the plan. As it grew towards the west, it kept the original north–south orientation. As it grew towards the east, this grid was tilted towards the south-east to match up with the grids of the former towns Analco and San Juan de Dios, across the river from central Guadalajara on the eastern side of Rio San Juan de Dios (Rio San Juan de Dios is now underground; it runs beneath Calzada Independencia).

When the railway was introduced to Guadalajara in 1888, the southern part of the city began development, and its streets aligned with the grid to the east of the old Rio San Juan de Dios. Additional 20th-century expansion of the city introduced even more variety, as developers introduced different kinds of non-grid street plans in new areas. During the government of José de Jesús González Gallo, between 1947 and 1953, major public works changed the urban landscape of the historic center of the city.

Major controversial projects included the widening of Avenida 16 de Septiembre and Avenida Juárez, which were no longer adequate to handle car traffic in the center of the city. In the process, many buildings of architectural and historical value were demolished. Historical buildings around Guadalajara Cathedral were also demolished to leave large open spaces on the four sides of the Cathedral in the form of a large Latin cross, in which the cathedral is now centered. There were other, somewhat less controversial, projects to improve the flow of traffic and increase commerce in other parts of the city.

=== Districts ===

[[File:Panorámica Guadalajara Country (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Western Guadalajara [[Central business district|business district]] skyline]]
Guadalajara is made up of more than 2,300 colonias (neighborhoods) in the Metropolitan Area. The oldest parts of the city include [[Centro, Guadalajara|Centro]] (the oldest in the city), Santuario, Mexicaltzingo, Mezquitan, Analco, and San Juan de Dios. Private houses in the oldest sector of the city are mostly made up of one- and two-level houses, with architectural styles ranging from simple colonial architecture to the Churrigueresco, Baroque, and early nineteenth century European styles.

Just west of the oldest part of the city are upper-class colonias built in the nineteenth and early twentieth century, containing the neoclassical structures and houses of the Porfiriato. In the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s well-to-do Tapatios expanded into colonias Lafayette, Americana, Moderna, and Arcos Vallarta. New architectural trends of the 1960s and 1970s also left their mark in colonias such as [[colonia Americana]], [[Vallarta Poniente]], Moderna, Providencia, Vallarta San Jorge, Jardines del Bosque, and Chapalita.

The Metropolitan Area has more wealthy neighborhoods than any other part of western Mexico. These colonias are located both inside and outside the municipality of Guadalajara, including some in its neighboring municipalities of Zapopan and Tlajomulco, in the west and south. Some of these colonias are: Colinas de San Javier, [[Puerta de Hierro, Guadalajara|Puerta de Hierro]], Providencia, Chapalita, Country Club, Ciudad del Sol, Valle Real, Lomas del Valle, Santa Rita, Monraz, Santa Anita Golf Club, El Cielo, Santa Isabel, Virreyes, [[Ciudad Bugambilias]], Las Cañadas, and Royal Country.

In general, residents in the west of the city are the wealthiest, while residents in the east are the poorest.

New development to accommodate the growing population is made up of a mix of middle-class colonias and housing complexes developed as part of government plans, and colonias developed less formally for working-class people. The Metropolitan Area extends to the west in colonias such as Pinar de la Calma, Las Fuentes, Paseos del Sol, El Colli Urbano, and La Estancia and extends to the east in colonias such as San Juan Bosco, San Andrés, Oblatos, Santa Cecilia, Insurgentes, Jardines de la Paz, and Tetlán.

The expansion of the population creates a constant demand for more colonias and more government infrastructure services.

== Coat of arms ==

[[File:Escudo de Armas de Guadalajara (Jalisco).svg|thumb|213x213px|Coat of arms of Guadalajara.]]
The coat of arms or seal of Guadalajara consists of a blue field, a pine of sinople outlined, two lions rampantes of color, opposite to forehead and the legs on the trunk, embroidery is of gold, consists of seven arms of gules. For stamp, closed helmet and for cimera a flag of gules, loaded with a [[cross of Jerusalem]] to the one that uses as shaft a lance of the same color, the [[Mantling|lambrequins]] are of gold and blue alternated.

The blue field means loyalty and serenity, the pine of [[Sinople (heraldry)|sinople]] means noble thoughts, the lions sovereignty and warlike spirit, the arms mean protection, favor and purity of the feelings, honor to the [[Battle of Baeza]] against the [[Moors]] in 1227. The helmet represents a degree of nobility, victory in the combat, the cross of [[Jerusalem]] means that the conquerors were descendants of the gentlemen of the crusades, and the lance signifies strength that is tempered by prudence.

[[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]], granted the title of [[city]] to Guadalajara and granted the shield in 1539.

The growth of the city is due to Guadalajara absorbing the closest communities. This was the case with the former communities Atemajac, Huentitán, Tetlán, Analco, Mexicaltzingo, Mezquitan, and San Andrés, among others.

Some of the closest communities to Guadalajara:

* [[Ixtlahuacán del Río]] (21.7&nbsp;km from the municipal seat of Guadalajara,{{coord|20|51|48.96|N|103|14|22.57|W}}).
* Santa Anita (19.6&nbsp;km from Guadalajara's municipal seat, {{coord|20|32|59.09|N|103|26|29.50|W}}).

In its 2007 survey entitled "Cities of the Future", ''[[FDi magazine]]'' ranked Guadalajara highest among major Mexican cities and designated Guadalajara as having the second strongest economic potential of any major North American city behind [[Chicago]].

In 2009 [[Moody's Investors Service]] assigned ratings of Ba1 (Global Scale, local currency) and A1.mx (Mexican national scale). During the prior five years, the municipality's financial performance had been mixed but had begun to stabilize in the latter two years. Guadalajara manages one of the largest budgets among Mexican municipalities and its revenue per capita indicator (Ps. $2,265) places it above the average for Moody's-rated municipalities in Mexico.<ref name="moodys"/>

The city's economy has two main sectors. Commerce and tourism employ most: about 60% of the population. The other is industry, which has been the engine of economic growth and the basis of Guadalajara's economic importance nationally even though it employs only about a third of the population.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="moodys"/><ref name="econgob"/> Industries here produce products such as food and beverages, toys, textiles, auto parts, electronic equipment, pharmaceuticals, footwear, furniture and steel products.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="econgob"/>

The city has to compete with China, especially for electronics industries which rely on high volume and low wages. This has caused it to move toward high-mix, mid-volume, and value-added services, such as automotive.

=== Technology ===

[[File:Guadalajara-México-Andares-Puerta de Hierro.jpg|left|thumb|[[Puerta de Hierro, Guadalajara|Puerta de Hierro]], financial and commercial centre]]

The electronics and information technology sectors that have nicknamed the city the "[[Silicon Valley]] of Mexico."<ref name="ijalti"/> Guadalajara is the main producer of software, electronic and digital components in Mexico. Telecom and computer equipment from Guadalajara accounts for about a quarter of Mexico's electronics exports.<ref name="rnorvell"/> Companies such as [[General Electric]], [[IBM]], [[Sanmina]], [[Intel]], [[HCL Technologies]], [[Hitachi]], [[Hewlett Packard Enterprise]], [[HP Inc]], [[Siemens]], [[Flextronics]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Wipro]], [[Tata Consultancy Services]], [[Cognizant Technology Solutions]] and [[Jabil Circuit]] have facilities in the city or its suburbs.<ref name="ijalti"/> This phenomenon began after the passage of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). International firms started building facilities in Mexico, especially Guadalajara, displacing Mexican firms, especially in information technology. One of the problems this has created is that when there are economic downturns, these international firms scale back.<ref name="enclave">{{cite journal |date=Mar–Apr 2008 |title= The enclave economy: foreign investment and sustainable development in mexico's silicon valley |journal=NACLA Report on the Americas |volume=41 |issue=2 |page=46 |location=New York}}</ref>

Guadalajara was selected as "Smart City" in 2013 by IEEE, the world's largest professional association for the advancement of technology.

Several cities invest in the areas of research to design pilot projects and as an example, in early March in 2013 was the first "Cluster Smart Cities" in the world, composed of Dublin, Ireland; San Jose, California; Cardiff, Wales, and Guadalajara, Jalisco, whose objective is the exchange of information and experiences that can be applied in principle to issues of [[agribusiness]] and health sciences.

The Secretariat of Communications and Transportation also reported that Guadalajara, Jalisco was chosen as the official venue for the first "Digital Creative City of Mexico and Latin America", which will be the spearhead for Mexico to consolidate the potential in this area.

The "Cluster Smart Cities" unprecedented in the world, will focus on what each of these cities is making in innovation and the creation of an alliance to attract technology. The Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Technology (SICyT ) of Jalisco, said the combination of talent development investments allows Jalisco to enter the "knowledge economy."

From 25 to 28 October 2015, the city was the venue for the first conference of the Smart Cities Initiative.<ref name="ciudadint">{{cite web |url=http://www.informador.com.mx/economia/2015/622072/6/guadalajara-la-primera-ciudad-inteligente.htm |title=Guadalajara, la primera Ciudad Inteligente |publisher=El Informador |location=Mexico City |language=es |access-date=October 25, 2015 |archive-date=October 26, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026104311/http://www.informador.com.mx/economia/2015/622072/6/guadalajara-la-primera-ciudad-inteligente.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="smartcity">{{cite web |url=http://mundocontact.com/guadalajara-primera-ciudad-inteligente-en-america-latina/ |title=Guadalajara, primera 'Ciudad Inteligente' en América Latina |date=April 2014 |publisher=Mundo Contact |location=Mexico City |language=es |access-date=April 1, 2014 |archive-date=24 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324191913/http://mundocontact.com/guadalajara-primera-ciudad-inteligente-en-america-latina/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Industries ===

Most of the economy revolves around commerce, employing 60% of the population.<ref name="encmuc"/> This activity has mainly focused on the purchase and sale of the following products: food and beverages, textiles, electronic appliances, tobacco, cosmetics, sports articles, construction materials, and others. Guadalajara's commercial activity is second only to Mexico City.<ref name="econgob"/>

The city is the national leader in the development and investment of shopping malls. Many shopping centers have been built, such as Galeries Plaza, one of the largest shopping centers in Latin America, and [[Andares]]. Galerías Guadalajara covers {{convert|160000|m²|2|abbr=on}} and has 220 stores. It contains the two largest movie theaters in Latin America, both with [[IMAX]] screens.

The 133,000 m<sup>2</sup> (1,400,000+ sq ft) mall offers hundreds of stores, a big food court located on the second floor, and several restaurants at the Paseo Andares.

A large segment of the commercial sector caters to tourists and other visitors. Recreational tourism is mainly concentrated in the historic downtown.<ref name="encmuc"/> In addition to being a cultural and recreational attraction and thanks to its privileged geographical location, the city serves as an axis to nearby popular beach destinations such as [[Puerto Vallarta]], [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]] and [[Mazatlán]].<ref name="econgob"/> Other types of visitors include those who travel to attend seminars, conventions and other events in fields such as academic, entertainment, sports, and business. The best-known venue for this purpose is the Expo Guadalajara, a large convention center surrounded by several hotels. It was built in 1987, and it is considered the most important convention center in Mexico.{{by whom|date=December 2015}}

=== Foreign trade ===

Most of Guadalajara's economic growth since 1990 has been tied with foreign investment. International firms have invested here to take advantage of the relatively cheap but educated and highly productive labor, establishing manufacturing plants that re-export their products to the United States, as well as provide goods for the domestic Mexican market.<ref name="jeades">{{cite book |last1=Eades |first1=J |title=Migrants Workers and the Social Order |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j2o9AAAAIAAJ&q=Guadalajara+economy&pg=PA42 |access-date=January 24, 2010 |year=1987 |publisher=Tavistock Publications |location=New York |page=42 |isbn=0-422-61680-X |archive-date=25 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230925164926/https://books.google.com/books?id=j2o9AAAAIAAJ&q=Guadalajara+economy&pg=PA42 |url-status=live }}</ref>

A media report in early October 2013 stated that five major Indian IT (information technology) companies have established offices in Guadalajara, while several other Indian IT companies continue to explore the option of expanding to Mexico. Due to the competitiveness in the Indian IT sector, companies are expanding internationally and Mexico offers an affordable opportunity for Indian companies to better position themselves to enter the United States market. The trend emerged after 2006 and the Mexican government offers incentives to foreign companies.<ref>{{cite news|title=Guadalajara is now an outpost for Indian IT firms|url=http://qz.com/129867/guadalajara-is-now-an-outpost-for-indian-it-firms/|access-date=3 October 2013|newspaper=Quartz|date=2 October 2013|author=Dale Quinn|archive-date=2 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002204048/http://qz.com/129867/guadalajara-is-now-an-outpost-for-indian-it-firms/|url-status=live}}</ref>

International investment has affected the labor market in the metro area and that of the rural towns and villages that surround it. Guadalajara is the distribution center for the region and its demands have led to a shifting of employment, from traditional agriculture and crafts to manufacturing and commerce in urban centers. This has led to mass migration from the rural areas to the metropolitan area.<ref name="jeades"/>

Guadalajara and the surrounding metropolitan area have numerous public, private, and digital libraries for the search and consultation of information. The promotion of culture and the enrichment of reading have made it easier for the citizen to require several facilities in the city. Some of the libraries also have a physical enclosure—among them the historic Octavio Paz Ibero-American Library of the University of Guadalajara and the Public Library of the State of Jalisco located in the adjoining city of [[Zapopan]]—with options for querying digital information over the Internet.

The Jalisco Regional Museum (formerly the seminary of San José) was built at the beginning of the 18th century to be the Seminario Conciliar de San José. From 1861 to 1914, it housed a school called Liceo de Varones. In 1918, it became the Museum of Fine Arts. In 1976, it was completely remodeled for its present use. The museum displays its permanent collection in 16 halls, 15 of which are dedicated to Paleontology, Pre-History, and Archeology. One of the prized exhibits is a complete mammoth skeleton. The other two halls are dedicated to painting and history. The painting collection includes works by Juan Correa, Cristóbal de Villalpando and José de Ibarra.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="finsemana"/>

=== Architecture ===

The style of architecture prevalent in Europe during the founding of Guadalajara is paralleled in the city's colonial buildings. The Metropolitan Cathedral and Teatro Degollado are the purest examples of neoclassical architecture. The historical center hosts religious and civil colonial buildings, which are noted for their architectural and historical significance and are a rich mix of styles that are rooted in indigenous cultural contributions (mainly from Ute origin), incorporated in the Mozarabic and castizo, and later in modern European influences (mainly French and Italian) and American (specifically, from the United States).

Construction began on the [[Guadalajara Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]] in 1558 and the church was consecrated in 1616. Its two towers were built in the 19th century after an earthquake destroyed the originals. They are considered one of the city's symbols. The architecture is a mix of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]], [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] and [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]]. The interior has three naves and eleven side altars, covered by a roof supported by 30 Doric columns.<ref name="finsemana"/>

[[File:Templo de San José de Gracia-1.jpg|thumb|upright|San José de Gracia Church, built in 1899]]
The Jalisco Famous People Roundabout (Rotonda de los Hombres Ilustres) is a monument made of quarried stone, built in 1952 to honor the memory of distinguished people from Jalisco. A circular structure of 17 columns surrounds 98 urns containing the remains of those honored. Across the street is the municipal palace which was built in 1952. It has four façades of quarried stone. It is mostly of Neoclassical design with elements such as courtyards, entrances, and columns that imitate the older structures of the city.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="finsemana"/>

The Palace of the State Government is in Churrigueresque and Neoclassical styles and was begun in the 17th century and finished in 1774. The interior was completely remodeled after an explosion in 1859. This building contains murals by José Clemente Orozco, a native of Jalisco, including "Lucha Social", "Circo Político", "Las Fuerzas Ocultas", and "Hidalgo", which depicts Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla with his arm raised above his head in anger at the government and the church.<ref name="finsemana"/>

The cathedral is bordered to the east by the [[Plaza de la Liberación]] (Freedom Square), nicknamed the Two Cups Square (Plaza de las Dos Copas), referring to the two fountains on the east and west sides. Facing this square is the [[Degollado Theater]] (Teatro Degollado). It was built in the mid-nineteenth century in Neoclassical design. The main portal has a [[pediment]] with a scene in relief called "Apollo and the Muses" sculpted in marble by Benito Castañeda. The interior vaulted ceiling is painted with a fresco by Jacobo Gálvez and Gerardo Suárez which depicts a scene from the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''. Behind the theater is another square with a fountain called the Founders Fountain (Fuente de los Fundadores). The square is in the exact spot where the city was founded and contains a sculpture depicting [[Cristóbal de Oñate]] at the event.<ref name="encmuc"/>

Between the Cathedral and the Hospice is the large [[Plaza Tapatía]], which covers {{Convert|70,000|m2|ft2|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Its centerpiece is ''[[Inmolación de Quetzalcóatl]]''.<ref name="encmuc"/> Southeast of this square is the Mercado Libertad, also called the Mercado de San Juan de Dios, one of the largest traditional markets in Mexico. The Temple of San Juan de Dios, a Baroque church built in the 17th century, is next to the market.<ref name="finsemana"/>

[[File:Don José María Morelos (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Equestrian statue of José María Morelos]]]]
At the far east end is the [[Plaza de los Mariachis]] and the Former Hospice Cabañas. The Plaza de los Mariachis is faced by restaurants where one can hear live mariachis play, especially at night. The Cabañs Former Hospice extends along the entire east side of the Plaza. This building was constructed by Manuel Tolsá beginning in 1805 under orders of Carlos III. It was inaugurated and began its function as an orphanage in 1810, in spite of the fact that it would not be finished until 1845. It was named after Bishop Ruiz de Cabañas y Crespo. The façade is Neoclassical and its main entrance is topped by a triangular pediment. Today, it is the home of the Instituto Cultural Cabañas (Cabañas Cultural Institute) and its main attraction is the murals by José Clemente Orozco, which cover the main entrance hall. Among these murals is "Hombre del Fuego" (Man of Fire), considered to be one of Orozco's finest works.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="finsemana"/>

Off this east–west axis are other significant constructions. The Legislative Place is Neoclassical and was originally built in the 18th century. It was reconstructed in 1982. The Palace of Justice was finished in 1897. The Old University Building was a [[Jesuit]] college named Santo Tomás de Aquino. It was founded in 1591. It became the second Mexican University in 1792. Its main portal is of yellow stone. The Casa de los Perros (House of the Dogs) was constructed in 1896 in Neoclassical design.<ref name="encmuc"/> On Avenida Juarez is the Sanctuary of Nuestra Señora del Carmen which was founded between 1687 and 1690 and remodeled completely in 1830. It retains its original coat of arms of the Carmelite Order as well as sculptures of the prophets [[Elijah]] and [[Elisha]]. Adjoining it is what is left of the [[Carmelite]] monastery, which was one of the richest in New Spain.<ref name="finsemana"/>

=== Music ===

[[File:Arena Guadalajara 4.jpg|thumb|left|Guadalajara Arena (Project)]]
[[Mariachi]] music is strongly associated with Guadalajara both in Mexico and abroad even though the musical style originated in the nearby town of [[Cocula, Jalisco]]. The connection between the city and mariachi began in 1907 when an eight-piece mariachi band and four dancers from the city performed on stage at the president's residence for both [[Porfirio Díaz]] and the Secretary of State of the United States. This made the music a symbol of west Mexico, and after the migration of many people from the Guadalajara area to Mexico City (mostly settling near Plaza Garibaldi), it then became a symbol of Mexican identity as well.<ref name="tturino">{{cite journal |last=Turino |first=Thomas |date=Fall 2003 |title= Nationalism and Latin American music: Selected case studies and theoretical considerations |journal=Revista de Música Latinoamericana |volume=24 |issue=2 |page=169 |location=Austin, Texas}}</ref>

Guadalajara hosts the Festival of Mariachi and [[Charreada|Charreria]], which began in 1994. It attracts people in the fields of art, culture and politics from Mexico and abroad. Regularly the best mariachis in Mexico participate, such as [[Mariachi Vargas]], [[Mariachi de América]] and [[Mariachi los Camperos de Nati Cano]].

The city is home to a renowned symphony orchestra. The Orquesta Filarmónica de Jalisco ([[Orquesta Filarmónica de Jalisco|Jalisco Philharmonic Orchestra]]) was founded by José Rolón in 1915. It held concerts from that time until 1924, when state funding was lost. However, the musicians kept playing to keep the orchestra alive. This eventually caught the attention of authorities and funding was restated in 1939. Private funding started in the 1940s and in 1950, an organization called Conciertos Guadalajara A. C. was formed to continue fundraising for the orchestra. In 1971, the orchestra became affiliated with the Department of Fine Arts of the State of Jalisco. The current name was adopted in 1988/ International soloists such as Paul Badura-Skoda, Claudio Arrau, Jörg Demus, Henryck Szeryng, Nicanor Zabaleta, Plácido Domingo, Kurt Rydl and Alfred Brendel have performed with the organization. Today the orchestra is under the direction of Marco Parisotto.<ref name="orchestra">{{cite web|url= http://www.ofj.com.mx/orquesta.htm |title=Orquesta Filarmónica de Jalisco |publisher=Orquesta Filarmónica de Jalisco |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Philharmonic Orchestra de Jalisco |access-date=January 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100106035704/http://www.ofj.com.mx/orquesta.htm |archive-date=January 6, 2010 }}</ref>

=== Cuisine ===

[[File:Gdl Cafe Vallarta.JPG|thumb|right|Cafe on Avenida Vallarta]]
As in the rest of Mexico, food in Guadalajara is a mix of pre-Hispanic and Spanish influences. Typical Mexican dishes, such as [[pozole]], [[tamal]]es, [[Sope (food)|sope]]s, [[enchilada]]s, [[taco]]s, [[menudo (soup)]], [[carne en su jugo]] and [[frijoles charros]] are popular.

One dish specific to Guadalajara is the "[[torta ahogada]]." It consists of a salted bun or roll (typically birote) smeared with refried beans, with fried pork cut into pieces — also known as "carnitas" — all in tomato sauce seasoned with spices. It is eaten with onions reduced in lemon and hot sauce. Accompanying drinks can include tejuino, which is made with a base of sourdough corn accompanied by lemon ice cream, or tepache, which is made from the bark of fermented pineapple.

Another typical meal of Guadalajara and the entire state of [[Jalisco]] is the "[[birria]]", which is usually made with either pork, beef, or goat. Handcrafted birria is made in a special oven, which can be underground and covered with maguey leaves; the meat can be mixed with a tomato broth and spices, or consumed separately.<ref name="guadgas">{{cite web|url= http://www.visitingmexico.com.mx/jalisco/destino_jalisco_guadalajara_gastronomia.php |title=Guadalajara Gastronomía |publisher=Visiting Mexico (SECTUR) |location=Mexico |language=es |trans-title=Guadalajara Gastronomy |access-date=January 27, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100211011647/http://www.visitingmexico.com.mx/jalisco/destino_jalisco_guadalajara_gastronomia.php |archive-date=February 11, 2010 }}</ref> The traditional way of preparing birria is to pit roast the meat and spices wrapped in maguey leaves.<ref name="guadguad">{{cite web|url= http://www.guadalajaraguadalajara.com/paginas.php?id=176 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090726232240/http://www.guadalajaraguadalajara.com/paginas.php?id=176 |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 26, 2009 |title=La Birria |language=es |access-date=January 27, 2010 }}</ref> It is served in bowls with minced onion, limes and tortillas.

[[File:Tequilas hechos en Jalisco, México (cropped).JPG|thumb|right|Most [[Tequila]] is produced in [[Jalisco]] in the regions north of Guadalajara around [[Tequila, Jalisco|Santiago de Tequila]] and [[Los Altos de Jalisco]].]]
Another typical dish of the tapatía kitchen is the ''{{ill|carne en su jugo|es|vertical-align=sup}}'' This dish consists of a beef broth with beans from the pot and is accompanied by bacon, coriander, onion, and radish (sliced or whole). The dessert that is considered as a typical tapatío is the [[jericalla]].

When the Spanish conquistadors arrived in the Aztec empire, a few religious ceremonies included eating [[pozole]] made with hominy and human flesh. This was the first type of pozole mentioned in Spanish writing, as a ritual dish eaten only by select priests and noblemen. The meat from the thighs of slain enemy warriors was used. The Franciscan missionaries ended this custom when they banned Aztec religious ceremonies. The pozole in the local common cuisine was related to the ritual dish, but prepared with turkey meat, and later pork, not with human flesh.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.elmanana.com/pozoleerapreparadoconcarnehumanaenepocaprehispanica-4060229.html |title=Pozole era preparado con carne humana en época prehispánica|language=es|access-date=October 1, 2017|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20171001122417/https://www.elmanana.com/pozoleerapreparadoconcarnehumanaenepocaprehispanica-4060229.html |archive-date=October 1, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Chapala133.JPG|thumb|[[Torta ahogada]], a typical dish.]]
Other dishes that are popular here include [[pozole]], a soup prepared with hominy, pork or chicken, topped with cabbage, radishes, minced onions, and other condiments; [[mole (sauce)|pipián]], which is a sauce prepared with peanuts, squash and sesame seed, and [[Bionico|biónico]], a popular local dessert.

[[Jericalla]]s are a typical Guadalajara dessert that is similar to flan, that was created to give children proper nutrients while being delicious. It is made with eggs, milk, sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon, and baked in the oven where it is broiled to the point that a burnt layer is produced. The burnt layer at the surface is what makes this dessert special and delicious.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://zonaguadalajara.com/el-origen-de-la-jericalla/|title=El origen de la Jericalla – Zona Guadalajara|website=zonaguadalajara.com|date=19 March 2015|access-date=2016-11-14|archive-date=13 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161113151907/http://zonaguadalajara.com/el-origen-de-la-jericalla/|url-status=live}}</ref>

One of the drinks that is popular in Guadalajara is Tejuino, a refreshing drink that contains a corn fermented base with sugarcane, lime, salt and chili powder.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://vive.guadalajara.gob.mx/es/qu%C3%A9-comer?p=706|title=Qué Comer? |website=vive.guadalajara.gob.mx|access-date=2016-11-14|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20161114172956/http://vive.guadalajara.gob.mx/es/qu%C3%A9-comer?p=706 |archive-date=2016-11-14|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The center of the city was repaved and new hotels were constructed for the approximately 22,000 rooms that were needed in 2011. The new bus rapid transit (BRT) system, Macrobús, was launched in March and runs along Avenida Independencia. The Pan-American village was built around the Bajio Zone. After the Games, the buildings will be used for housing. There are already 13 existing venues in Guadalajara that the games will use, including the [[Jalisco Stadium]], UAG 3 de Marzo Stadium, and the UAG Gymnasium. Eleven new sporting facilities were created for the event.

== Government ==

[[File:Palacio Municipal de Guadalajara 2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|City Hall of Guadalajara]]
As the capital of the state, the city is the seat of the state's government. As a result, state politics have a heavy influence on local decision-making and vice versa. Historically, the mayorship of the city has been a common leaping platform for the state governorship. Additionally, because of the sheer size of the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area vis-à-vis the rest of the state, the city's urban agglomeration—largely dominated and coordinated by the Guadalajara city council—captures 12 of the 20 seats in the state legislature allocated by the district.

All three branches of the state government are concentrated around the historic city center, with the Palace of Government, the seat of the state executive, immediately southeast of the cathedral. North, across the Freedom Square (Plaza de la Liberación), is the State Legislature Building, and immediately east of the latter is the Supreme Tribunal of State Justice.

[[File:Palacio de Justicia-2 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Palace of Justice of Jalisco]]
Like other municipalities in Mexico, Guadalajara is governed by a municipal president, who exercises executive power for three consecutive years. This office is currently occupied by Enrique Alfaro (Movimiento Ciudadano).

The legislature has the cabildo, formed by the form chosen by the candidate for mayor, made up of aldermen, who are not elected by the people by direct or indirect voting, but the return happens automatically if the mayor wins.

The municipality is divided into five [[Federal Electoral Districts of Mexico|electoral districts]] for the purpose of election of representatives of the city in the federal legislature. These districts are the VIII, IX, XI, XIII, and XIV of the state of Jalisco.

The city and the municipality of Guadalajara are essentially co extensive with over 99% of the municipality living within the city limits and nearly all of the municipality urbanized.<ref name="encmuc"/><ref name="INEGI">{{cite web|url= http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |title=INEGI Census 2005 |language=es |access-date=2009-11-23 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070328224939/http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/sistemas/conteo2005/localidad/iter/ |archive-date=2007-03-28 }}</ref> Urbanization centered on the city spreads out over seven other municipalities; of [[Zapopan]], [[Tlaquepaque]], [[Tonalá, Jalisco|Tonalá]], [[Tlajomulco]], [[El Salto, Jalisco|El Salto]], [[Ixtlahuacán de los Membrillos]], and [[Juanacatlán]].<ref name="CONAPOzm2005"/>

Guadalajara is well connected by a number of modern highways. These include Fed 15D, which connects the city northwestward to [[Nogales, Sonora]], via [[Tepic, Nayarit]] and eastwards to Mexico City via [[Morelia]]; Fed 80D which runs northeast toward [[Aguascalientes, Aguascalientes|Aguascalientes]]; and Fed 54D which runs southward to the coast via [[Colima, Colima|Colima]]. The city's well-connected transportation infrastructure allows easy access to [[Mexico City]], to the southeast, and to the major beach resorts of [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]], [[Mazatlán]] and [[Puerto Vallarta]] to the southwest, northwest, and west, respectively.
