'''Delicias''' (Spanish for ''Delights'') is a city in the [[Mexican state]] of [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]] and serves as the seat of the [[Delicias (municipality)|municipality of the same name]]. The current president of this town is Mr. Leonardo Jiménez, who has also been a participant in the creation of first-level cities. It is located southeast of the [[state capital]], [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]]. Delicias was declared an official [[municipality]] of the state of Chihuahua on January 7, 1935. Delicias is a small industrial city and a major [[Agriculture|agricultural]] center located in the Conchos River Valley. As of 2015, the city of Delicias had a population of 148,045 inhabitants,<ref name="inegi.org.mx"/> while the metropolitan area had a population of 223,993 inhabitants.<ref name="inegi.org.mx"/> It was founded on 30 April 1933, making it one of Mexico's youngest cities. The municipality of Delicias is one of the smallest in the state in terms of size area.

== History ==

Prehistoric artifacts have been found in the Conchos River Valley that show evidence that indigenous people lived in the area for centuries before European settlers arrived in the area.  Several indigenous mummies were found in the valley and are on display in the Museum of Paleontology in Delicias.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chihuahua.gob.mx/turismoweb/Contenido/plantilla5.asp?cve_canal%3D417%26Portal%3Dturismoweb |title=Gobierno del Estado de Chihuahua.- :: Portal Gubernamental :: |access-date=2009-09-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080320094959/http://www.chihuahua.gob.mx/turismoweb/Contenido/plantilla5.asp?cve_canal=417&Portal=turismoweb |archive-date=2008-03-20 }}</ref>

The area of present-day Delicias began to attract settlers in 1884 when the Central Mexican Railroad Company built a railroad station to fulfill the transportation demands for agricultural products from the Old Delicias Hacienda. In 1888, German settlers arrived in the area and built Hacienda Polvorosa; they began to prepare food items, brew beer, and produce steel instruments. However, the German settlers were forced to leave after continuous persecution by the [[Villistas]]. The Old Delicias Hacienda and Hacienda Polvorosa were the beginnings of the Delicias settlement. Later Hacienda Polvorosa was renamed El Hotel del Norte; this is now a popular museum in town. During the next few decades, the surrounding area began to grow and many small municipalities like [[Rosales, Chihuahua|Rosales]], [[Meoqui]], and [[Saucillo (municipality)|Saucillo]] began to sprout.  In 1932, the Chihuahua State Congress recognized this area as an important agricultural region, and named it Region 5. The city of Delicias was founded in 1933 after the [[Mexican Revolution]] and was officially declared a municipality on January 7, 1935.

In 1939 cotton in the Conchos River Valley helped build a foundation for a small industrial sector in Delicias. Cotton Gins and American Petroleum Refineries were built to provide services and products needed to fuel the agriculture sector. The [[Francisco I. Madero]] Dam was built, which increased crop yields and grew the population in the valley. During the 1940s, Cotton became such a dominant cash crop that by 1943 it replaced many vineyards in the surrounding area. Cotton continued to be the dominant crop of the Conchos River Valley until 1953, when the price of cotton plunged and forced many farmers in the area to diversify the agriculture economy.

The modern layout of Delicias was designed by Carlos G. Blake and was approved by the National Commission of Irrigation on September 30, 1960. The Chihuahua State Congress recognized Delicias as a city on October 29, 1960. That same year, a geological study on the Conchos River was conducted in Region 5 in attempts to build the largest dam in the state of Chihuahua. By 1960, Delicias was the fourth most populous city in the state of Chihuahua (after Juarez, Chihuahua and Cuauhtemoc City).

Delicias continued to grow in population and as a successful agricultural center.  Delicias had an agricultural based economy until 1980 when important exporting [[maquiladora]]s moved to the city which helped increase the manufacturing sector. By 1990, Delicias was home to seven maquiladoras, making it one of the most important municipalities of the state of Chihuahua.

== Geography ==

Delicias is located at 28º11’35" N Latitude and 105º28’18" W Longitude, {{Convert|1170|m|ft}} above sea level. Delicias lies in the rich Conchos River Valley and Meoqui to the north and Saucillo to the south and Rosales to the west. The [[Conchos River]] flows north on the west side of Delicias. About 30 miles south of Delicias, [[La Boquilla]] Reservoir holds back the [[Conchos River]] that begins in the highest parts of the heartland of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]]. [[La Boquilla]] Reservoir, the largest dam in the state of Chihuahua, provides sustainable water supply to the valley along federal highway 45 including Delicias and the surrounding towns. In September 2008, La Boquilla Reservoir reached its maximum capacity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://sdpnoticias.com/sdp/contenido/2008/09/03/31891 |title=Presa Boquilla de Chihuahua se Llena Luego de 15 Años. &#124; SDP Noticias |access-date=2009-09-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024442/http://sdpnoticias.com/sdp/contenido/2008/09/03/31891 |archive-date=2011-07-16 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The western side of Delicias is dominated by the  edge of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] mountain range that runs northwest to southeast. Southeast of the city the [[Sierra del Diablo]] mountain range runs southwest to northeast. Northeast of the city the dominant ''[[solonchak]]s'' and extreme arid conditions do not allow the land to be used for agriculture, but in the rest of the surrounding plains and mountains rich soils are found.

=== Climate ===
Delicias has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BWh''), receiving only {{convert|334.2|mm|in|1}} of rainfall per year.
