'''Culiacán''', officially '''Culiacán Rosales''', is a city in northwestern [[Mexico]], the capital and largest city of both [[Culiacán Municipality]] and the state of [[Sinaloa]]. The city was founded on 29 September 1531 by the Spanish [[Conquistadores|conquerors]] [[Lázaro de Cebreros]] and [[Nuño de Guzmán|Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán]] under the name "Villa de San Miguel", referring to its patron saint, [[Michael the Archangel]].

As of the 2020 [[National Institute of Statistics and Geography|INEGI]] census, Culiacán had an estimated population of 808,416, placing it as the [[List of cities in Mexico|21st most populous city in Mexico]], while its metropolitan area had a population of 1,003,530, being the [[Metropolitan areas of Mexico|17th most populous metropolitan area in Mexico]].

The city is in a valley on the slopes of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], at the confluence of the [[Tamazula River|Tamazula]] and [[Humaya River|Humaya]] Rivers, where both join to form the [[Culiacán River]] 55 m above sea level.

== Etymology ==
The genuine [[Aztecs|Aztec]] name of the [[Nahuatl]] language is '''Colhuacan''' or '''Culhuacan''', which is from ''colhua'' or ''culhua'' and ''can'', which is a place, and its meaning varies according to different historians:

* "snake place"
* "crooked hill"
* "where walkers twist the path"

The most respected theory is "place of the colhuas", that is "inhabited by the colhua tribe", and the most frequent meaning is "place of worshiping the god Coltzin".<ref>{{Cite web|date=3 September 2007|title=Sinaloa – Culiacán|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/sinaloa/mpios/25006a.htm|access-date=3 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930022423/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/sinaloa/mpios/25006a.htm|archive-date=30 September 2007}}</ref>

==History==

=== Prehispanic era ===
In ancient times, there was an indigenous settlement called Huey Colhuacan that dated back to [[Tecpatl]], which corresponds to the year 628 CE. The [[Aztecs]] built it during their pilgrimage. Its exact location is unknown, but it is assumed that it was close to the current town of [[Culiacancito|Culiacáncito]]. The ancient settlers were called Culichis.

===Founding ===
The city that we know today as Culiacán was co-founded in 1531 by [[conquistador]]s [[Lázaro de Cebreros]] and [[Nuño de Guzmán|Nuño Beltrán de Guzmán]] under the name "Villa de San Miguel". Upon their arrival in the 16th century, the Spanish found the existence of farmhouses organized in indigenous nations by the [[tribe]] of the [[Tahues]], which brought together a group of people of the same origin and language who had a common tradition.

Other indigenous peoples that inhabited the original territory of Culiacán were the [[Tebacas]], [[Pacaxes]], [[Sabaibo]] and [[Achires]].

After their war of conquest, in 1531, de Cebreros and de Guzmán organized the territories acquired into three provinces. One of them was Culiacán, which was delimited to the South by the [[Elota River]] and to the North by the Mocorito River, depending on the [[Nueva Galicia|Kingdom of Nueva Galicia]]. Organized in this way, the territory lasted until 1786, the year in which the administration system was implemented,{{Clarify|reason=What administration system? The [[Nueva Galicia]] page mentions nothing of the sort (that I could find).|date=May 2022}} with [[Sonora]] and [[Sinaloa]] forming the province of Arizpe and the older province of Culiacán remaining the same.

=== Independent Mexico ===
On 6 October 1821, [[Mexican War of Independence|independence]] was sworn in Culiacán. Culiacán was granted the category of city, on 21 July 1823, when the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa separated by decree from Congress. In 1824, by the [[Constitutive Act of the Mexican Federation]], Sinaloa and Sonora met again, forming the state of the West. On 13 October 1830, the provinces of Sonora and Sinaloa were definitively separated by decree, with the city of Culiacán designated capital of the state of Sinaloa. In 1861, during the conservative government of the [[Second French intervention in Mexico|French Intervention]], prefectures were installed and the Municipalities Law was decreed that divided the Districts into City Councils. The [[Badiraguato]] District was suppressed and became part of the Culiacán District as a municipality.

From 1859 to 1873, the capital of Sinaloa was moved from Culiacán to Mazatlán. In the [[Restored Republic (Mexico)|Restored Republic]], Governor Eustaquio Buelna confronted the merchants of the port. He returned to Culiacán and the Local Congress gave it the status of capital of the state.

=== Porfirian and revolutionary times ===
In 1878, Culiacán had three City Halls, whose headwaters were Culiacán, [[Quilá]] and [[Badiraguato]]. It remained that way until 1880, when Badiraguato returned to being a district with the limits that previously corresponded to it.

The year 1912 was when municipalities were established by law as a new form of internal government, but it was not until 1915 that this law came into force and political directories were suppressed, causing the districts to become free municipalities.

Culiacán was established as a municipality by decree on 8 April 1915. Within its original limits was the current Municipality of [[Navolato, Sinaloa|Navolato]], which was segregated from Culiacán on 27 August 1982, depriving the city of {{convert|2285|km2|mi2}} of valley agriculture.

Sometime later, the State Congress approved the extension of the name of the capital city, giving it its current official name of Culiacán de Rosales. "Rosales" honors the great Mexican military man [[Antonio Rosales]], who fought in the second French Intervention and the [[Reform War]], along with serving as the governor of Sinaloa.

=== After World War II ===

Beginning in the late 1950s, Culiacán became the birthplace of an incipient [[underground economy]] based on illicit drugs exported to the United States. The completion of the [[Pan-American Highway]] and the regional airport in the 1960s accelerated the expansion of workable distribution infrastructure for the enterprising few families that would later come to dominate the international [[drug cartel]]s along Mexico's Pacific Northwest. The [[Sinaloa Cartel]] made Culiacán its primary base.<ref>{{cite news|title=Mexico's Sinaloa gang grows empire, defies crackdown|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-drugs-idUSTRE70I6UZ20110119|access-date=5 January 2023|newspaper=Reuters|date=19 January 2011|archive-date=12 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170312002339/http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mexico-drugs-idUSTRE70I6UZ20110119|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 17 October 2019, after an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to arrest one of the cartel leaders, widespread gunfights broke out across the city, leading to multiple deaths, in what has been called the "[[Battle of Culiacán]]". One of [[Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán]]'s relatives, [[Ovidio Guzmán]], was arrested by police, but were forced to release him.<ref name="nytimes.com">{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/world/americas/culiacan-mexico-chapo-son.html|title = After Soldiers Surrender el Chapo's Son, a Shocked Mexican City Sighs with Relief|newspaper = The New York Times|date = 20 October 2019|last1 = Villegas|first1 = Paulina|access-date = 29 January 2022|archive-date = 29 January 2022|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220129014011/https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/20/world/americas/culiacan-mexico-chapo-son.html|url-status = live}}</ref>

== Coat of arms ==
[[File:Culiacan Escudo.PNG|thumb|Coat of arms of the city of Culiacán.]]
The coat of arms of the municipality and the city of Culiacán in Sinaloa, Mexico, has various elements that represent the history of the municipality yesterday and today.

Rolando Arjona Amábilis was the artist behind the official coat of arms of the Municipality of Culiacán, which was made official through municipal decree number 13 May 26, 1960 and published in number 90 of the Official Newspaper of the State of Sinaloa on 30 July 1960.

Its shape is square with rounded corners, ending in a point. The entire face of the shield is covered with a [[carmine]] color. In the center is a [[Aztec script|hieroglyph]] representing a hill with a human head inclined forward. This glyph alludes to [[Coltzin]], "the crooked god", an authentic figure of [[Aztec mythology|Nahuatl mythology]], who gave its name to the Nahuatlaca-Colhua tribe and, in turn, to the town of its residence, Colhuacán or Teocolhuacán.

Across the face of the shield, there are symbols of water referring to rivers. In the central part and towards the left side, a cross is followed by a path on which footprints can be observed that end in a small construction. These motifs symbolize the missionaries of San Miguel de Culiacán left for the North, and they are invoked as an obligatory tribute to the goodness and heroism of the missionaries.

On the carmine border, the word "Culiacán" can be read in its upper part, and in its lower part the word "Colhuacán", which corresponds to the true name of the place in the [[Nahuatl|Nahuatl language]]. In the upper part of the shield, there is a hill with a germinating seed and the figure of a golden sun, alluding both to the tropical climate of this region and to the fundamentally agricultural effort of its inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Escudo de Culiacán|url=https://www.culiacan.gob.mx/informacion/escudo/|title=Escudo|access-date=10 September 2020|archive-date=14 August 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200814203629/https://www.culiacan.gob.mx/informacion/escudo/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Relief and hydrography ===

The relief of the municipality is well defined by a mountainous part and the coastal plain. The mountainous part corresponds to the physiographic region of the highlands, part of the Pacific slope of the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] mountain range with elevations of 300 to 2,100 meters above sea level.<ref>{{Cite web|date=1 October 2013|title=Sinaloa – Culiacán|url=http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/EMM25sinaloa/municipios/25006a.html|access-date=3 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013080229/http://www.e-local.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/EMM25sinaloa/municipios/25006a.html|archive-date=13 October 2013}}</ref> The coastal plain lies to the West and is crossed by four regional rivers: the [[Humaya River|Humaya]], [[Tamazula River|Tamazula]], [[Culiacán River|Culiacán]] and [[San Lorenzo River (Mexico)|San Lorenzo]]. The Humaya has its origin in the [[Durango|State of Durango]], entering Sinaloa through [[Badiraguato]]; its waters are controlled by the Licenciado Adolfo López Mateos dam. The Tamazula River arises in the Sierra Madre Occidental near the Topia Valley; its waters are controlled by the Sanalona dam. The Humaya and Tamazula Rivers unite in front of the city of Culiacán to form the [[Culiacán River]], which empties into the [[Gulf of California]]. The San Lorenzo is borne from the Sierra Madre Occidental within the State of Durango, enters Sinaloa through [[Cosalá]] and empties into the Gulf of California.

=== Climate ===
[[File:Culiacán sunset.jpg|thumb|209x209px|Sunset in Culiacán.]]
Culiacán has a hot [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: ''BSh''), despite receiving an annual rainfall over {{convert|600|mm|in|abbr=on}}, due to its hot temperatures and high evaporation. Summers are very hot and humid, shade temperatures can reach {{convert|45|C|F|0}} and high humidity can produce heat indices of {{convert|50|to|55|C|F}}, with the risk of heavy rainfall from decaying [[tropical cyclone]]s also present. Winters are much milder with less humidity and an average high of 27&nbsp;°C, with warm nights.

The city of Culiacán Rosales occupies only a part of the municipality of Culiacán and in 2010 had an urban area of 65 km2, being the largest in the state of Sinaloa and has a population of 675,773 inhabitants (of which 329,608 are men and 346,165 are women), according to the 2010 Population and Housing Census carried out by the (INEGI), resulting in a population density of 10,396.5 inhabitants / km2.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=SEDESOL|url=http://cat.microrregiones.gob.mx/catloc/contenido.aspx?clave=250060001&tbl=tbl01}}{{Dead link|date=October 2022 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> concentrating 78.7% of the total urban population of the Municipality.

The city ranks 20th in number of foreign population, which amounts to 6,693 inhabitants, which represent almost 1% of the total population; Among the main nationalities we find Americans, Canadians, Spanish, Italians, Greeks, Argentines, Cubans, Colombians, Brazilians, Chinese, Japanese, Russians, Ukrainians, Venezuelans, Dominicans, Germans, among others.

The presence of people of Greek origin that occurred in the 1940s and 1950s coincided with the incipient but flourishing emergence of agriculture. This attracted a lot of Hellenic labor for the tillage of the land, and seeing that it was a profitable business, they communicated it to their family and friends. This attracted a greater number of people; today they have inherited a legacy to their children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren that make up the few thousand people who continue to live in the city. It is believed that the Greek community is the largest in Mexico and the best organized, the president of said community is in charge of Basilio Karamanos Pérez(Deceased).

=== City zoning ===
The city is divided into different areas mainly:

The Historical [[Downtown Culiacán|Center of Culiacán]] is the original area of the city, in which most of the buildings of the Spanish colonization between the 16th and 19th centuries are found, it comprises a territorial extension of approximately 247,123 ha (2,471&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). From the '70s onwards, there was a process of depopulation of the area due to the high costs of rents, the bustle of the main streets and avenues and the priority of having more commercial spaces, but in recent years there has been a process of repopulation of the same with the construction of apartments in the periphery of the Center and a project of urban reorganization in which it is intended to have a higher population density.
[[File:Culiacán downtown.jpg|thumb|212x212px|Culiacán downtown in April 2010.]]
Las Colonias, which are the first settlements that were populating the perimeter around the original urban area by people from different social strata to have a largely wide space close to the Center; Among the best known and with the largest number of population we find: Infonavit Humaya, Tierra Blanca, 6 January, Stase, Juntas de Humaya, Almada, Miguel Alemán, Centro Sinaloa, Morelos, Palmito, El Barrio, Aurora, etc.

The subdivisions for their part are places divided by different construction companies, in which there are in certain sections, the same style of housing, housing people of lower middle class, middle and upper middle class, among the best known are: La Conquista, Villas del Rio, Valle Alto, Los Pinos, Villa Verde and Villa Fontana.

The Terminal de Autobuses de Culiacán or Central de Autobuses Culiacán Millenium is a bus terminal located west of the city of Culiacán, Sinaloa, Mexico. The station is built in front of the Country Club. This plant replaced the old plant that was to the south, in front of Blvd. Gabriel Leyva Solano.

===Transit system===

====Urban transport====
At present{{When|date=July 2024}}, Culiacán has just over 68 urban transport routes, which serve about one million users. The Culiacán urban transport is operated by RedPlus.<ref name="tusbuenasnoticias2">{{Cite news|url = https://www.tusbuenasnoticias.com/sinaloa/culiacan/rutas-de-camiones-urbanos-en-culiacan-en-2024/33710|title = ¿Cuáles son las rutas de camiones urbanos en Culiacán en 2024?|newspaper = Tus Buenas Noticias|date = 21 June 2024|access-date = 16 July 2024|archive-date = 16 July 2024|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20240716235825/https://www.tusbuenasnoticias.com/sinaloa/culiacan/rutas-de-camiones-urbanos-en-culiacan-en-2024/33710|url-status = live}}</ref>

====Rail====
The city has a train station, operated by [[Ferromex]], and it is used only to transport freight. It is connected to south with Mazatlán and north with Guaymas.

====Bus station====
Culiacán uses the ''Central Internacional de Autobuses "Millennium"'' ("Millennium" International Buses Station) to travel across all Mexico (north, central, and south) and to the United States (Arizona and California). This replaced the old bus terminal in the southern city.

===Roads and expressways===
Though several high-speed roads have been built, most of the city's streets are rather narrow and traffic jams are common at rush hours. Now, 300,000 cars are in Culiacán, making the per capita number of cars one of the highest in the country considering the 745,000 inhabitants.

====Main roads====
Culiacán has several roads (avenues, boulevards, streets, etc.), but some of these are the main quick connection to other points of the city.

On 17 February 2014, investigators from Mexico and the United States learned that [[Joaquín Guzmán Loera]], or El Chapo, was using underground sewage tunnels in Culiacán by constructing hatches connecting to the drainage network in the bathtubs of his city "stash houses".<ref name="Boston.com">{{cite web|title=Officials: Wiretaps, aides led to drug lord arrest|url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/latin-america/2014/02/24/officials-wiretaps-aides-led-drug-lord-arrest/v0BHlTsBoJxhAiFaZqVRGK/story.html|publisher=Boston.com}}</ref>
On at least one occasion, authorities chased Guzman into the tunnels, but lost him. An AP reporter said some of the tunnels were well lit, had wood paneling, and were air-conditioned.<ref name="Boston.com"/>
