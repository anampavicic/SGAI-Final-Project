'''Turbo''' is a port city in [[Antioquia Department]], [[Colombia]]. Part of the Urabá Antioquia sub-region, it is located on the coast of [[Gulf of Urabá]], 340&nbsp;km north of [[Medellín]] (the department capital and second largest city). This port city is the capital of the [[Urabá Antioquia|Urabá]] region of Antioquia. The place where Turbo is today was known as Pisisí, but by 1741 people were already talking about Turbo. By a decree on May 11, 1839, the central government spent one thousand pesos for military service barracks in Turbo. In 1840, the republican president assigned one thousand [[fanega]]s of uncultivated lands for the new population. It was established as a municipality in 1847.

Turbo lies near the southeastern tip of the [[Darién Gap]] and is the northern terminus of the main route of the [[Pan-American Highway]] in [[South America]]. There is currently no paved road connecting through the region to [[Yaviza]], [[Panama]], where the highway continues through [[Central America|Central]] and [[North America]].

===Climate===
Turbo has a monthly mean temperature above {{convert|18|°C|°F|0|disp=or}} in every month of the year and a distinct dry season, with the driest month measuring less than {{convert|60|mm|in|1|disp=or}} of precipitation. The [[Köppen climate classification]] subtype for Turbo’s climate is ''Am'' ([[tropical monsoon climate]]), although it borders on ''Af'' ([[tropical rainforest climate]]). The average temperature for the year in Turbo is {{convert|81.0|°F|°C|1|disp=or}}, with extremely small variations through the year.<ref>[http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=26008&cityname=Turbo--United-States-of-America Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Turbo, Colombia (closest city on record to Sapzurro)]</ref> Rainfall in Turbo is heavy due to strong surface westerly winds from the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]] (ITCZ) located near Turbo’s latitude, although it is much less from January to March when the ITCZ reaches its most southerly latitude, resulting in the town’s classification as a monsoon climate.
