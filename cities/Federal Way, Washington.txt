'''Federal Way''' is a city in [[King County, Washington|King County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States and part of the [[Seattle metropolitan area]]. One of the most recently incorporated cities in the county,<ref name="CityHistory" /> its population was 101,030 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]].<ref name="2020 Census (City)">{{cite web|title=Explore Census Data |url=https://data.census.gov/profile/Federal_Way_city,_Washington?g=160XX00US5323515 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=December 5, 2023}}</ref> Federal Way is the [[List of municipalities in Washington|10th most populous city in Washington]] and the 5th most populous in King County.

==History==
Originally a logging settlement, the area was first called "Federal Way" in 1929 to refer to a [[school district]].<ref name="Naming">{{cite web |url=http://www.federalwayhistory.org/Articles/FedWay_Schools2.pdf |page=2 |work=FederalWayHistory.org |title=Early Federal Way Schools and the Naming of the Federal Way Area |author=Historical Society of Federal Way |year=2004 |access-date=May 10, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720012754/http://www.federalwayhistory.org/Articles/FedWay_Schools2.pdf |archive-date=July 20, 2011 |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The name derived from [[U.S. Route 99#Washington|U.S. Route 99]] (now [[Washington State Route 99|State Route 99]] or [[Pacific Highway (United States)|Pacific Highway South]]), a federally-designated highway which ran through the state and connected Seattle to [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]].<ref name="Naming" /><ref>{{cite book |last=Phillips |first=James W. |year=1971 |title=Washington State Place Names |page=[https://archive.org/details/washingtonstatep00phil/page/49 49] |publisher=[[University of Washington Press]] |isbn=0-295-95158-3 |oclc=1052713900 |url=https://archive.org/details/washingtonstatep00phil |url-access=registration |via=[[The Internet Archive]] |access-date=November 18, 2019}}</ref> Five existing schools consolidated operations into [[Federal Way Public Schools|School District No. 210]] in 1929 and planned construction of [[Federal Way High School]], which opened in 1930 and gave its name to the school district.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cityoffederalway.com/about |title=About City of Federal Way |website=City of Federal Way |access-date=December 24, 2017 |archive-date=December 25, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171225035117/http://www.cityoffederalway.com/about |url-status=live }}</ref> The local [[chamber of commerce]] adopted the name in the early 1950s.<ref name="CityHistory">{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoffederalway.com/Page.aspx?view=85 |title=City History |author=City of Federal Way |access-date=May 10, 2010 |work=CityOfFederalWay.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027170416/http://cityoffederalway.com/Page.aspx?view=85 |archive-date=October 27, 2010 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

Attempts to incorporate the city were voted down in 1971, 1981 and 1985.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url=http://www.historylink.org/File/4215 |title=Federal Way - Thumbnail History |last=Stein |first=Alan |website=Historylink |access-date=December 24, 2017 |archive-date=December 15, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171215204248/http://historylink.org/File/4215 |url-status=live }}</ref> The voters eventually approved incorporation as a city on February 28, 1990;<ref name="CityHistory" /> the official act of incorporation was held at the Sportsworld Lanes bowling complex.<ref name=":1" />

===Growth since incorporation===
As part of the [[Washington State Growth Management Act]] of 1990 (GMA), Federal Way has identified areas of unincorporated King County as Potential Annexation Areas (PAAs) to be annexed to the city. Federal Way's current PAAs include the Star Lake and Camelot neighborhoods in [[Lakeland North, Washington|Lakeland North]] and the neighborhoods of Parkland, Lakeland, and Jovita in [[Lakeland South, Washington|Lakeland South]]. All of these neighborhoods are located east of the city proper. In 2004, the city annexed the Northlake, East Redondo, and Parkway neighborhoods, adding over 2,700 people and nearly {{convert|1|sqmi|sqkm|1}} of area. While Federal Way had previously considered Auburn's West Hill, Auburn annexed that along with Lea Hill in 2007.

In February 2007, the city announced formal plans to annex the majority of unincorporated land on its east border as one PAA named East Federal Way, comprising the Star Lake, Camelot, Lakeland, and Jovita neighborhoods,<ref name=oldpaamap>[http://www.cityoffederalway.com/folders/home/businesseconomicdevelopment/projectsconstruction/potentialannexationareaplanning/Large%20PAA%20map.gif PAA Community Level Subareas map] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110103090714/http://www.cityoffederalway.com/folders/home/businesseconomicdevelopment/projectsconstruction/potentialannexationareaplanning/Large%20PAA%20map.gif |date=January 3, 2011 }}</ref><ref name=newpaamap>[http://www.cityoffederalway.com/GetFile.aspx?id=12165 Federal Way Proposed Annexation Area map]{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and a strip of Peasley Canyon Road connecting the two areas. Annexation of the area would add 20,000 people and nearly {{convert|7|sqmi|1}} to the city, creating the sixth largest city in Washington by population, at over 106,000 residents and nearly {{convert|29|sqmi}}.<ref name=eastfwannex>[http://www.cityoffederalway.com/Page.aspx?view=777 Proposed East Federal Way Annexation Area] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071110100800/http://www.cityoffederalway.com/Page.aspx?view=777 |date=November 10, 2007 }}</ref>

On August 21, 2007, residents of the proposed East Federal Way annexation area rejected annexation to Federal Way by a 66% to 34% margin.<ref name=kcannex>[https://web.archive.org/web/20061010224300/http://www.metrokc.gov/annex//efedway.aspx East Federal Way annexation information] (King County)</ref> Opponents of the plan, favoring remaining under direct [[King County, Washington|King County]] government, asserted fears that increased density and higher taxes would result from annexation despite proponents showing studies that taxes and fees would be unchanged.<ref name=tntannexresults>{{cite web |url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/auburn/story/138421.html |work=[[Tacoma News Tribune]] |first=Mike |last=Archbold |title=Two annexation areas passing |date=August 22, 2007 |access-date=August 17, 2008}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In 2011, opponents of annexation petitioned King County to designate this same area as a [[township]], an undefined municipal structure that does not currently exist anywhere else in the state but which the state constitution provides for. Under the plan, township status would prevent the annexation of the area, which would be named Peasley Canyon Township.<ref name="township">{{cite news |newspaper=Federal Way Mirror |url=http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/south_king/fwm/news/125898333.html |title=Committee proposes new township in unincorporated King County |last=Hobbs |first=Andy |date=July 21, 2011 |access-date=January 10, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727015840/http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/south_king/fwm/news/125898333.html |archive-date=July 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all}}</ref> The King County Council declined to act on the proposal, and the county elections board denied the group a ballot item.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peasleycanyontownship.org/?p=102 |title=Complaint filed with the courts |author=Jerry |date=August 17, 2011 |access-date=May 23, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140711230950/http://peasleycanyontownship.org/?p=102 |archive-date=July 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Economy and attractions==
[[File:Weyerhaeuser Building (Federal Way) 11.jpg|thumb|right|The former [[Weyerhaeuser]] headquarters]]

Until 2014, Federal Way was home to [[Weyerhaeuser]], the largest private owner of [[softwood]] timberland in the world. Weyerhaeuser had opened much of its land in Federal Way to the public, including two [[botanical garden]]s: the [[Rhododendron Species Foundation and Botanical Garden]], and the Pacific [[Bonsai]] Museum. In 2014, the company announced it would vacate its Federal Way headquarters. City leaders suggested promoting the location for a potential [[community college]] campus. Federal Way is also home to the US headquarters of [[World Vision International]].

Other attractions in the city include the [[Weyerhaeuser King County Aquatic Center]], which features an Olympic-size swimming pool which has been used for the [[1990 Goodwill Games]] and 2012 US Olympic Swim & Dive Trials. Celebration Park includes sports fields, a playground, and wooded trails. The city has also developed many lakefront and neighborhood parks, playgrounds, and trails.

The {{convert|40|acre|adj=on}} PowellsWood Garden, known for its outstanding structural plantings and perennial borders, is located off South Dash Point Road. This land, on a portion of the Cold Creek ravine, was purchased by Monte and Diane Powell in 1993 in order to preserve green space in an increasingly urbanized area.

[[Wild Waves Theme Park|Wild Waves Theme & Water Park]], the largest amusement park in the region, opened in 1977 on the south side of the city. It is the [[Seattle]] area's only permanent [[amusement park]]. [[Six Flags]] purchased Wild Waves in December 2000. However, after low sales, Six Flags sold the park in April 2007 to Parc Management LLC of [[Jacksonville, Florida]], for $31.75 million.

Federal Way is locally identified by its 1990s semi-urban development, characterized by landscaped off-street multi-structure apartment complexes and shopping centers. [[The Commons at Federal Way]], the city's only indoor shopping mall, is located on South 320th Street and Pacific Highway South ([[Washington State Route 99|State Route 99]]) near the city's main [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] exit.

===Downtown tower projects===
In 2007, the city of Federal Way purchased a downtown lot formerly used by a defunct [[AMC Theatres]] cinema, and invited proposals from two developers, [[United Properties]] and Alpert Capital, to develop a multi-use tower project in the downtown core, adjacent to the recently built transit center. Such a project follows in the steps of similar multi-use developments such as Kent Station in nearby [[Kent, Washington|Kent]]. The city awarded the contract to United Properties' "Symphony" project, comprising four 15–22 story towers, including {{convert|60000|sqft|m2}} of retail and office space, 900 housing units, and a large downtown park which would be relinquished to the city.

In 2011 the city renewed its Request for Quotes for the undeveloped site, and received three proposals. The city ultimately chose a proposal by [[Arcadd]] known as the "Crystal Palace", a densely packed glass multi-tower structure where some of the towers bend outward near the top under 20 stories with a larger retail and public space pavilion at the base.<ref name="crystalpalace">{{cite news |newspaper=Federal Way Mirror |url=http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/south_king/fwm/news/125983348.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130131104029/http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/south_king/fwm/news/125983348.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=January 31, 2013 |title=Crystal Palace coming soon to downtown Federal Way |last=Allmain |first=Greg |date=July 22, 2011}}</ref> The developers, however, were unable to obtain the funds by the initial deadline.

The lot was rechristened Town Square Park and opened in early 2014. A plan for a more permanent park design on the site is being considered.

To the north of the downtown park, an elevated lot which was formerly the location of a [[Toys "R" Us]] store has been purchased by the city, which is slated to host a planned performing arts and civic center (PACC). The PACC proposal has been controversial, largely over funding and self-sustaining concerns (a similar city project, the Federal Way Community Center, opened in 2007 and ran for most of its operational history in the red), but has the support of most city leaders. It opened as the Performing Arts & Event Center (PAEC) in August 2017.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://fwpaec.org/about-us/ |title=About Us |access-date=February 7, 2019 |archive-date=February 9, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190209124606/https://fwpaec.org/about-us/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
