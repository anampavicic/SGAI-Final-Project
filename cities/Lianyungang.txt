'''Lianyungang''' ({{Zh|s={{linktext|连云港}}|t={{linktext|連雲港}}|p=Liányúngǎng}}) is a [[prefecture-level city]] in northeastern [[Jiangsu]] [[province of China|province]], China. It borders [[Yancheng]] to its southeast, [[Huai'an]] and [[Suqian]] to its south, [[Xuzhou]] to its southwest, and the province of [[Shandong]] to its north. Its name derives from [[Lian Island]], the largest island in Jiangsu which lies off its coastline, and [[Yuntai Mountain (Jiangsu)|Yuntai Mountain]], the highest peak in Jiangsu, a few miles from the city center, and the fact that it is a port. The name can be literally translated as the Port Connecting the Clouds.

Lianyungang was home to 4.65 million inhabitants as of the 2020 census whom 1,210,767 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of Haizhou and Lianyun counties. Lianyungang was known in the West as '''Haichow''' (Postal romanization), which means the City of Sea. Haichow was opened to foreign trade by the Qing imperial government in 1905.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

==Geography==
Lianyungang is between 118°24' and 119°48' east longitude and 34°11' and 35°07' north latitude. Lianyungang covers an area of {{convert|7777|km2|abbr=on}}.

Lianyungang is one of the first 14 Chinese coastal cities opening to the outside world and a rising center of industry, foreign trade, and tourism in east China. It is the eastern terminus of the [[New Eurasian Land Bridge]] and the proposed [[Northern East West Freight Corridor]]. The New Eurasia Continental Landbridge continue by land, connecting Lianyungang with over 40 countries and regions in [[Europe]], [[South Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] by railway networks.

The Lianyun-Port, in the center of the coast, links eastern sea routes with western land routes. [[Japan]] and [[South Korea]] in the east can be reached economically and conveniently from Lianyungang. Near the port, the [[Tianwan Nuclear Power Plant]] is one of the biggest nuclear power plants in China, with two operational units and six more planned. Lianyungang is also rich in mineral resources. [[Donghai County]] has 70% of the national reserve of natural crystal, and is manufacturing 80% of China’s crystal products.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jiangsu.net/city/city.php?name=donghai|title=Donghai, Jiangsu, China|website=www.jiangsu.net|access-date=2017-09-04}}</ref>

The [[Government of the People's Republic of China|Chinese government]] has stated its intention to build an economic belt along the New Eurasia Continental Landbridge in "the [[Ninth Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|Ninth Five-Year Plan]] of the National Economy and Social Development and the Long-range Goal for the Year 2010." On "China's 21st Century Agenda", Lianyungang is to be developed into an international seaport linking countries on the Pacific rim with those in Central Asia. In the "National Ocean Development Plan" it is listed as one of three special development zones.

Lianyungang Economic & Technological Development Zone was approved by the State Council as one of the first batch of state-level development zones in December 1984. It is in the eastern new seashore urban area of Liangyungang City. The distance to the nearest airport, Liangyungang Airport is {{convert|10|–|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} and the distance to the nearest highway G310 is {{convert|10|–|20|km|mi|abbr=on}}. Lianyungang port is {{convert|20|–|50|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://rightsite.asia/en/industrial-zone/lianyungang-economic-technological-development-zone/ Rightsite.asia | Lianyungang Economic & Technological Development Zone]</ref>

On July 18, 2019, began a construction on a large petrochemical storage dock in the Xuwei area of the port of Lianyungang.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://portuguese.xinhuanet.com/2019-07/18/c_138236759.htm|title=Construção começa no cais de armazenamento petroquímico fortemente investido_portuguese.xinhuanet.com|website=portuguese.xinhuanet.com|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref>

== Climate ==

The temperature in Lianyungang can reach average highs of 30&nbsp;°C in the summer and drop to as low as −4&nbsp;°C in the winter. Lianyungang’s climate is classified by [[Köppen Climate Classification|Köppen]] and Geiger as [[Humid subtropical climate|Cwa]] (humid subtropical climate with dry winters).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.climate-data.org/asia/china/jiangsu/lianyungang-2443/|title=Lianyungang climate: Average Temperature, weather by month, Lianyungang weather averages - Climate-Data.org|website=en.climate-data.org|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref>

The vast majority of precipitation occurs between June and August, where it can measure up to 278mm of rainfall on average. Winter precipitation is quite low, making snowfall rare and short-lived.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldweatheronline.com/v2/weather-averages.aspx?q=LYG|title=Nancheng Weather Forecast|website=WorldWeatherOnline.com}}</ref> Extremes since 1961 have ranged from a record high of {{convert|40.2|°C|0}} on July 15 2002 to a record low of {{convert|-18.1|°C|0}} on 5 February 1969.<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 2023 |title=连云港国家高新技术产业开发区气候可行性论证区域评估报告（简本） |url=http://js.cma.gov.cn/dsjwz/lygs/njszfxxgk/sjfdzdgknr/sjtzgg/202405/P020240514317032559120.pdf |access-date=24 October 2024 |website=Jiangsu Meteorological Bureau (in Chinese)}}</ref>

[[File:连云港连岛海滨浴场 1.jpg|thumb|The sea beach of Lian Island Resort]]
One of the most popular tourist attractions in Lianyungang and the only [[Tourist Attraction Rating Categories of China|AAAA-Class]] beachfront in Jiangsu Province, [[Lian Island]] ({{zh|s=连岛|p=lián dǎo}}) is a beautiful island connected to Lianyun District by a {{convert|6.7|km|abbr=on}} sea dyke, the longest in China.

=== Huaguo Mountain ===
{{main|Mount Huaguo (Jiangsu)}}
Lianyungang is famous for its "Huaguo Shan, Shuilian Dong" ({{lang|zh-hant|花果山水簾洞}}) attraction. Shuiliandong literally means the "Water Curtain Hole," since, according to legend, the hole was hidden behind a waterfall, therefore resembling a "curtain of water."

The hole is famous because according to legend it is the home of [[Sun Wukong]], commonly known as the Monkey King from the epic novel ''[[Journey to the West]]''. In this hole, underneath the mountain is where he and his monkey subjects lived. After learning [[Tao]], the Monkey King travelled back to the hole so that he and his subjects could eat and play for eternity. Eventually, the [[Jade Emperor]] sent heavenly armies to battle him at this spot because of his misdeeds. While the Monkey King story is a work of fiction, [[Xuanzang]], the monk whom he accompanies on the journey of the novel, was based on a historical person.
