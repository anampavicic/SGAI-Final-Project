==History==
{{Moresources|section|date=January 2022}}
[[File:Saint Sofia Church.jpg|thumb|left|[[Saint Sophia Cathedral, Harbin|Saint Sofia Church, Harbin]]]]

Ancient Chinese records and other sources state that Heilongjiang was inhabited by people such as the [[Sushen]], [[Buyeo]], the [[Mohe people|Mohe]], and the [[Khitan people|Khitan]]. [[Mongol]]ic [[Donghu people]] lived in [[Inner Mongolia]] and the western part of Heilongjiang.<ref>[http://www.orientaldiscovery.com/html/2011/11/201111231554001713.html Origins of Minority Ethnic Groups in Heilongjiang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322043037/http://www.orientaldiscovery.com/html/2011/11/201111231554001713.html |date=2014-03-22 }}</ref> Some names are Manchu or Mongolian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iqh.net.cn/lsdl_dmx_show.asp?column_id=2506&column_cat_id=469 |script-title=zh:浅谈黑龙江省地名的特点 |website=iqh.net.cn |language=zh-cn |access-date=16 January 2011 |archive-date=23 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723122439/http://www.iqh.net.cn/lsdl_dmx_show.asp?column_id=2506&column_cat_id=469 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The eastern portion of Heilongjiang was ruled by the [[Balhae|Bohai Kingdom]] between the 7th and 10th centuries, followed by the Khitan [[Liao dynasty]]. The Jurchen [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)]] that subsequently ruled much of north China arose within the borders of modern Heilongjiang.

Heilongjiang as an administrative entity was created in 1683, during the [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]] era of the [[Manchu]] [[Qing Dynasty]], from the northwestern part of the [[Jilin]] province.<ref name=edmonds>{{cite book|title=Northern Frontiers of Qing China and Tokugawa Japan: A Comparative Study of Frontier Policy|first=Richard Louis|last=Edmonds|publisher=University of Chicago, Department of Geography; Research Paper No. 213|isbn=0-89065-118-3|year=1985|page=6}}</ref> This Heilongjiang Province only included the western part of today's Heilongjiang Province, and was under the supervision of the General of Heilongjiang (Sahaliyan Ula i Jiyanggiyūn) (the title is also translated as the Military Governor of Heilongjiang; ''jiyanggiyūn'' is the Manchu reading of the Chinese word {{lang|zh-hant|將軍}} {{transl|zh|jiāngjūn}}; "military leader, general" and is cognate with [[Japanese language|Japanese]] ''[[shōgun]]''), whose power extended, according to the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]], as far north as the [[Stanovoy Mountains]]. The eastern part of what's today Heilongjiang remained under the supervision of the General of Jilin (Girin i Jiyanggiyūn), whose power reached the [[Sea of Japan]]. These areas deep in [[Manchuria]] were closed off to [[Han Chinese]] migration.

[[File:镇守黑龙江等处地方将军印，黑龙江将军府.jpg|thumb|Seal of the Guard General of Heilongjiang at the Heilongjiang General Mansion]]
The original seat of the Military Governor of Heilongjiang, as established in 1683, was in Heilongjiang City (also known as [[Aigun]] or [[Heihe]], or, in [[Manchu language|Manchu]], Saghalien Ula), located on the Amur River. However, already in 1690 the seat of the governor was transferred to [[Nenjiang County|Nenjiang]] (Mergen) on the [[Nen River]], and, in 1699, further south to [[Qiqihar]]. According to modern historians, the moves may have been driven by supply considerations: Nenjiang and Qiqihar are connected by a convenient waterway (Nen River) with southern Manchuria, whereas accessing Aigun (Heihe) would require either sailing all the way down the [[Sungari River]] until its confluence with the Amur and then up the Amur to Heihe, or using a [[portage]] over the Lesser Xing'an Mountains between the Nen River valley and the Amur valley. An additional advantage of Qiqihar may have been its location at the junction of a northbound road (to Nenjiang) and a westbound one (to Mongolia), enabling its garrison to defend both against the Russians and the Ölöt [[Mongols]].<ref>Edmonds (1985), pp. 115–117</ref>

Little Qing Military presence existed north of Aigun. According to the 18th- and early-20th-century European sources and the reports of the Russians in the 1850s, the farthest Qing "advance guard" post was at Ulusu-Modon (Ulussu-Mudan) ({{zh|乌鲁苏穆丹}} ''Wūlǔsūmùdān''), near the Amur River's famous S-shaped meander. (The post was on the left (north) bank of the river, lost to the Russians in 1860.)

In 1858 and 1860, the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government was [[Amur Annexation|forced to give up]] all land beyond the [[Amur River|Amur]] and [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]] Rivers to the [[Russian Empire]], cutting off the Qing Empire from the [[Sea of Japan]] and giving Heilongjiang its present northern and eastern borders. At the same time, [[Manchuria]] was opened to [[Han Chinese]] migration by the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government. By the early twentieth century, due to the ''[[Chuang Guandong]]'', the [[Han Chinese]] had become the dominant ethnic group in the region.<ref>Patrick Fuliang Shan, "Taming China's Wilderness: Immigration, Settlement, and the Shaping of the Heilongjiang Frontier, 1900–1931", Ashgate, 2014, {{ISBN|978-1-4094-6389-4}}</ref>

In 1931, Japanese forces [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|invaded]] Heilongjiang. In 1932, the Japanese completed their conquest of the province, which became part of the [[Japan]]ese [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].

In 1945, Japanese forces in Manchuria were [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|defeated by the Soviet Army]]. During the [[Chinese Civil War]], Soviet forces aided the Chinese communists. Heilongjiang became the first province to be completely controlled by the communists and [[Harbin]] the first major city to be controlled by them.

At the beginning of communist rule, Heilongjiang included only the western portion of the present-day province, and had its capital at Qiqihar. The remaining area was the [[Songjiang Province|province of Songjiang]]; its capital was Harbin. In 1954, these two provinces were merged into present-day Heilongjiang. During the [[Cultural Revolution]], Heilongjiang was also expanded to include [[Hulunbuir League]] and some other areas previously in [[Inner Mongolia]]; this has since mostly been reversed.

==Geography==
{{Unsourced|section|date=August 2022}}
Heilongjiang is a land of varied topographies. Much of the province is dominated by mountain ranges such as the [[Greater Khingan]] Range and [[Lesser Khingan]] Range, [[Zhangguangcai Mountains]], [[Laoye Mountains]], and [[Wanda Mountains]]. The highest peak is [[Datudingzi Mountain]] at {{convert|1690|m}}, located on the border with [[Jilin]] province. The Greater Khingan Range contains China's largest remaining virgin forest and is an important area for China's forestry industry.

The east and southwest of the province, which are relatively flat and low in altitude, feature the [[Muling River]], the [[Naoli River]], the [[Songhua River]], the [[Nen River]], and the [[Mudan River]], all tributaries of the [[Amur River|Amur]], while the northern border forms part of the [[Amur River|Amur]] valley. [[Xingkai Lake]] (or [[Khanka Lake]]) is found on the border with [[Russia]]'s [[Primorsky Krai]].

===Climate===
