== History ==
The name Lhokseumawe comes from the words ''lhok'' and ''seumawe''. ''Lhok'' means "deep", "bay", and "ocean trenches", and Lhokseumawe means the swirling water in the sea along the offshore of [[Banda Sakti]] and its surroundings. The city was formerly part of [[North Aceh Regency]], from which it was separated to form an independent city on 21 June 2001. The area is linked to the emergence of the kingdom of [[Samudera Pasai]] around the 13th century, which later came under the sovereignty of [[Sultanate of Aceh]] in 1511.

=== Pre Colonial Era ===
[[File:Aceh Sultanate en.svg|thumb|220px|left|Map of Aceh Sultanate during the reign of Sultan Iskandar Muda]]
The Sultanate of Aceh was established by Sultan Ali Mughayatsyah in 1511. Later, during its [[golden era]], in the 17th century, its [[wikt:Special:Search/territory|territory]] and political influence expanded as far as [[Satun]] in southern [[Thailand]], [[Johor]] in [[Malay Peninsula]], and Siak in what is today the province of [[Riau]]. As was the case with most non-Javan pre-colonial states, [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] power expanded outward by sea rather than inland. As it expanded down the Sumatran coast, its main competitors were Johor and [[Portuguese Malacca]] on the other side of the [[Straits of Malacca]]. It was this seaborne trade focus that saw Aceh rely on rice imports from north [[Java]] rather than develop [[self sufficiency]] in rice production.<ref>Ricklefs (1991), page 17</ref>
After the Portuguese occupation of [[Malacca]] in 1511, many Islamic traders passing the [[Malacca Straits]] shifted their trade to [[Banda Aceh]] and increased the [[Acehnese people|Acehnese]] rulers' wealth. During the reign of [[Sultan Iskandar Muda]] in the 17th century, Aceh's influence extended to most of [[Sumatra]] and the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Aceh allied itself with the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Dutch East India Company]] in their struggle against the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and the [[Johor Sultanate]]. Acehnese military power waned gradually thereafter, and Aceh ceded its territory of [[Pariaman]] in [[West Sumatra]] to the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] in the 18th century.<ref>*D. G. E. Hall, ''A History of South-east Asia''. London: Macmillan, 1955.</ref>

=== Colonial Era ===
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Straatgezicht in Lhokseumawe Atjeh TMnr 60038921.jpg|220px|thumbnail|left|Street scene in Lhokseumawe in the Dutch colonial period]]
Before the 20th century, the country was ruled by uleebalang Kutablang. In 1903, after resistance fighters against Dutch colonists weakened Aceh, Aceh began to master.

Lhokseumawe conquered areas and from then on the status of Lhokseumawe was "Bestuur Van Lhokseumawe" with Zelf Bestuurder is [[Teuku Abdul Lhokseumawe]] subordinate Controeleur aspirants and also domiciled in Lhokseumawe and assistant resident district officer or Regent.

In the second decade of the 20th century, among the entire mainland of Aceh, a small island about 11&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> widely separated by [[Krueng Cunda River]]. filled buildings General Government, Military, and Transportation Railway by the Dutch government. Small islands with villages of Keude Aceh, Kampung Jawa, Kuta blang, Mon Geudong, Teumpok Teungoh, Hagu Kampung, Uteuen bayi and Ujong Blang are entirely new 5,500 plural in Lhokseumawe call. Building by building fills this land until the city has realized embryos harbor, market, railway station and the offices of government agencies.

=== Independence era ===
On 21 September and 22 September 1953, [[Darul Islam (Indonesia)|Darul Islam]] forces [[Battle of Lhokseumawe|attacked Lhokseumawe]] twice, but the Indonesian army repelled the attack.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Putra |first1=Bisma Yadhi |title=Perang Tiga Hari Tiga Malam di Kota Lhokseumawe |url=https://kinija.id/perang-tiga-hari-tiga-malam-di-kota-lhokseumawe/ |website=kinija.id |date=21 February 2022 |publisher=Kinja |access-date=9 March 2023 |archive-date=9 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230309110455/https://kinija.id/perang-tiga-hari-tiga-malam-di-kota-lhokseumawe/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Since the Declaration of Independence, the Government of the Republic of Indonesia has not established systemic to this district. At first Lhokseumawe combined with Bestuurder Van Cunda. The mainland population is increasingly crowded, coming from surrounding areas such as Buloh Blang Ara, Matangkuli, Blang Jruen, Lhoksukon, Nisam, Cunda and Pidie.

In 1956 the Emergency Law No. 7 of 1956, the autonomous regions formed regencies within the region of North Sumatra province, where one of them is the North Aceh Regency with its capital at Lhokseumawe.

Then in 1964 the Decree of the Governor of Aceh Special Region Number 34/GA/1964 dated 30 November 1964, it was determined that Kemukiman Banda Sakti in Muara Dua, the District used its own under the name of the District Banda Sakti.

Based on the Act No. 5 of 1974 on the Principles of Regional Administration, Lhokseumawe be likely to improve the status of the City of, on August 14, 1986, with the Regional Regulation No. 32 of 1986 Establishment of the City of Lhokseumawe signed by President of Indonesia [[Suharto]], which was inaugurated by the Minister of [[Roestam Soeparjo]] country on 31 August 1987. Given that it is'' de jure'' and'' de facto'' Lhokseumawe became the City of the area of 181.06&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> which includes 101 villages and 6 urban villages in five districts, namely the Districts of Banda Sakti, Muara Dua, Dewantara, Muara Batu, and Blang Mangat.

From 1988 onwards, the idea of improving the status of the town began. Law No. 2 of 2001 (dated 21 June 2001), signed by the president of Indonesia [[Abdurrahman Wahid]], established Lhokseumawe as a separate municipality whose territory then included three districts, namely the districts of Banda Sakti, Muara Dua and Blang Mangat (Dewantara and Muara Batu Districts remained in North Aceh Regency). In 2006 the district of Muara Dua was split into two - Muara Dua and Muara Satu - so Lhokseumawe now has four districts.

== Geography ==
Lhokseumawe City is located between 4˚ - 5˚ North Latitude and 96˚ - 97˚ East Longitude with an average altitude of 13 metres above sea level. Lhokseumawe was given the status of an independent city (separate from [[North Aceh Regency]], which surrounds it on all the landward sides) based on Law Number 2 of 2001, dated 21 June 2001. Lhokseumawe City is divided into 4 districts, 9 residents, 68 villages, and 259 sub-villages within the boundaries of the area. Lhokseumawe forms a [[semi-enclave]] within [[North Aceh Regency]].
