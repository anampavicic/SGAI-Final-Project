After his visit, the gate was named O'Dwyer Gate. However, after the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]], the people demanded to rename the gate, the name of O'Dwyer was removed from the gate and it was renamed the Railway Gate.

On the visit of [[Nehru]] on 1 June 1936, it was renamed the Nehru Gate, and the president of Municipal Committee Jaranawala Lala Harnam Das approved the name on 30 March 1937. The name was changed again after the independence of [[Pakistan]], when the first president of the Municipal Committee of Jaranawala, Syed Altaf Hussain, renamed it the Pakistani Gate. The Pakistani Gate was reconstructed in 1956, 1967 and 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rqHlMAnRYoE  |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/rqHlMAnRYoE |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title=Video |website=www.youtube.com |access-date=2020-06-17}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mcjaranwala.lgpunjab.org.pk/History.html|title=MC Jaranawala Website|website=mcjaranwala.lgpunjab.org.pk|access-date=2020-04-19|archive-date=2022-09-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220912152811/http://mcjaranwala.lgpunjab.org.pk/History.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Pakistani_Gate.jpg|title=English: Pakistani Gate (Jaranwala)|date=March 25, 2010|via=Wikimedia Commons}}</ref>
