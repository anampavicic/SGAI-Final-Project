==Etymology==
{{More citations needed section|date=February 2023}}
There are many opinions among different investigators, as to the origin of the word ''Karbala''. Some have pointed out that ''Karbala'' has a connection to the "Karbalato" language, while others attempt to derive the meaning of word by analyzing its spelling and language.{{clarify|date=October 2023}} They conclude that it originates from the "Kar Babel" group of ancient Babylonian villages that included Nainawa, Al-Ghadiriyya, Karbella (or Karb Illu), Al-Nawaweess, and Al-Heer. This last name is today known as Al-Hair and is where [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn]] ibn Ali's grave is located.

The investigator [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] had pointed out that the meaning of ''Karbala'' could have several explanations, one of which is that the place where Husayn ibn Ali was martyred is made of soft earth—{{transl|ar|al-Karbalāt}}.

According to Shia's belief, the archangel [[Gabriel]] narrated the true meaning of the name ''Karbala'' to [[Muhammad]]: a combination of {{transl|ar|karb}} ({{langx|ar|كَرْب|links=no}}, "the land which will cause many agonies") and {{transl|ar|balāʾ}} ({{langx|ar|بَلاء|links=no}}, "afflictions").<ref name="kamil01">{{cite book |last=al-Qummi |first=Ja'far ibn Qūlawayh |translator=Sayyid Mohsen al-Husaini al-Mīlāni |title=Kāmil al-Ziyārāt |year=2008 |publisher=Shiabooks.ca Press |page=545}}</ref>

==History==
===Battle of Karbala===
{{main|Battle of Karbala}}

The Battle of Karbala was fought on the bare deserts on the way to Kufa on October 10, 680 AD (10 Muharram 61 AH). Both [[Husayn ibn Ali]] and his brother [[Abbas ibn Ali]] were buried by the local Banī Asad tribe, at what later became known as the ''Mashhad Al-Husayn''. The battle itself occurred as a result of Husain's refusal of [[Yazid I|Yazid]]'s demand for allegiance to his caliphate. The Kufan governor, Ubaydallah ibn Ziyad, sent thirty thousand horsemen against Husayn as he traveled to [[Kufa]].  Husayn had no army, he was with his family and few friends who joined them, so there were around 73 men, including the 6-month-old [[Ali al-Asghar ibn Husayn|Ali Asghar]], son of Imam Husayn, in total. The horsemen, under 'Umar ibn Sa'd, were ordered to deny Husayn and his followers water in order to force Husayn to agree to give an oath of allegiance. On the 9th of Muharram, Husayn refused, and requested to be given the night to pray. On the 10th day of Muharram, Husayn ibn Ali prayed the morning prayer and led his troops into battle along with his brother Abbas. Many of Husayn's followers, including all of his present sons [[Ali al-Akbar ibn Husayn|Ali Akbar]], [[Ali al-Asghar ibn Husayn|Ali Asghar]] (six months old) and his nephews Qassim, Aun and Muhammad were killed.<ref>al-Tabari, Muhammad ibn Jarir – History of the Prophets and Kings; Volume XIX The Caliphate of Yazid ibn Muawiyah, translated by I.K.A Howard, SUNY Press, 1991</ref>

In 63&nbsp;AH (683&nbsp;AD), Yazid ibn Mu'awiya released the surviving members of Husayn's family from prison as there was a threat of uprisings and some of the people in his court were unaware of who the battle was with, when they got to know that the descendants of Muhammad were killed, they were horrified. On their way to Mecca, they stopped at the site of the battle. There is record of Sulayman ibn Surad going on pilgrimage to the site as early as 65 AH (685 AD). The city began as a tomb and shrine to [[Husayn ibn Ali]], grandson of [[Muhammad]] and son of [[Ali ibn Abi Talib]],<ref name="Seyyed"/> and grew as a city in order to meet the needs of pilgrims. The city and tombs were greatly expanded by successive Muslim rulers, but suffered repeated destruction from attacking armies. The original shrine was destroyed by the [[Abbasid]] Caliph [[Al-Mutawakkil]] in 850 but was rebuilt in its present form around 979, only to be partly destroyed by fire in 1086 and rebuilt yet again.

===Early modern===
Like [[Najaf]], the city suffered from severe water shortages that were only resolved in the early 18th century by building a dam at the head of the Husayniyya Canal. In 1737, the city replaced [[Isfahan (city)|Isfahan]] in [[Iran]] as the main centre of Shia scholarship. In the mid-eighteenth century it was dominated by the dean of scholarship, [[Yusuf Al Bahrani]], a key proponent of the [[Akhbari]] tradition of Shia thought, until his death in 1772,<ref>Juan Cole, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ntarP5hrza0C Sacred Space and Holy War]'', IB Tauris, 2007 p. 71–72</ref> after which the more state-centric [[Usuli]] school became more influential.

In order to reassert their authority, the Ottoman army laid siege to the city. On January 13, 1843, Ottoman troops entered the city. Many of the city leaders fled leaving defense of the city largely to tradespeople. About 3,000 Arabs were killed in the city, and another 2,000 outside the walls (this represented about 15% of the city's normal population). The Turks lost 400 men.<ref>Cole, Juan R.I. and Moojan Momen. 1986.

The Shia-ruled Indian Province of [[Awadh]], known by the British as Oudh, had always sent money and pilgrims to the holy city. The Oudh money, 10 million rupees, originated in 1825 from the Awadh [[Nawab]] [[Ghazi-ud-Din Haider]]. One third was to go to his wives, and the other two-thirds went to holy cities of Karbala and Najaf. When his wives died in 1850, the money piled up with interest in the hands of the British [[East India Company]]. The EIC sent the money to Karbala and Najaf per the wives' wishes, in the hopes of influencing the [[Ulama]] in Britain's favor. This effort to curry favor is generally considered to have been a failure.<ref>"A Failed Manipulation: The British, the Oudh Bequest and the Shī'ī 'Ulamā' of Najaf and Karbalā'."

===Hadith===
The tomb of the martyred Imam has acquired great significance in [[Shia]] tradition because he and his fellow martyrs are seen as models of jihad in the way of God. Shi'ites believe that Karbala is one of the holiest places on Earth according to the following traditions (among others):
* The angel [[Gabriel]] narrated to [[Muhammad]] that:<ref name="kamil01"/>
{{blockquote|text=Karbala, where your [[Hussein ibn Ali|grandson]] and his family will be martyred, is one of the most blessed and the most sacred lands on Earth, and it is one of the valleys of Paradise.}}
* The fourth [[Imamah (Shia doctrine)|Shi'ite Imam]], that is [[Ali al-Sajjad|Zayn al-Abidin]] narrated:<ref>{{cite book |last=al-Qummi |first=Ja'far ibn Qūlawayh |translator=Sayyid Mohsen al-Husaini al-Mīlāni |title=Kāmil al-Ziyārāt |year=2008 |publisher= Shiabooks.ca Press |page=534}}</ref>
{{blockquote|text=God chose the land of Karbalā' as a safe and blessed sanctuary twenty-four thousand years before He created the land of the [[Ka'bah]] and chose it as a sanctuary. Verily it (Karbala) will shine among the gardens of Paradise like a shining star shines among the stars for the people of Earth.}}
* In this regard, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]] narrates, 'Allah, the Almighty, has made the dust of my ancestor's grave – Imam Husain (r.a) as a cure for every sickness and safety from every fear.'<ref>Amali by [[Shaykh Tusi]], vol. 1 pg. 326</ref>
* It is narrated from Ja'far that: "The earth of the pure and holy grave of Husayn ibn ‘Ali (r.a) is a pure and blessed musk. For those who consume it, it is a cure for every ailment, and if our enemy uses it then he will melt the way fat melts, when you intend to consume that pure earth recite the following supplication"<ref>Mustadrakul Wasail, vol. 10, pg 339-40 tradition 2; Jadid Makarimul Akhlaq pg.189; Beharul Anwaar vol. 101, tradition 60</ref>

===Popular culture===
There are many references in books and films to Karbala, specifically referring to Imam Husayn's death at the [[Battle of Karbala]]. One such example is the Iranian film [[Hussein Who Said No]]. In paintings, Husayn is often depicted on a white horse impaled by arrows.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} A number of documentaries detailing the events of the Battle of Karbala have also been produced.

===Karbala in other cultures===
In the [[Indian subcontinent]], ''Karbala'', apart from meaning the city of Karbala (which is usually referred to as ''Karbala-e-Mualla'' meaning Karbala the exalted), also means local grounds where commemorative processions end and/or ''[[Ta'zieh#Ta'zīya in India|ta'zīya]]'' are buried during Ashura or Arba'een, usually such grounds will have ''shabeeh'' (copy) of ''Rauza'' or some other structures.<ref>[http://ora.ouls.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid%3A8307ae11-21a4-4a2e-95b0-cb76d59212fb/datastreams/ATTACHMENT03 (Re-)defining Some Genre-Specific Words: Evidence from some English Texts about Ashura], Muhammad-Reza Fakhr-Rohani, University of Qom, Iran</ref><ref>A citation from Fruzzetti, "Muslim Rituals," for this use of Karbala is as follows: "The Muslims then proceed to 'Karbala' to bury the flowers which were used to decorate the tazziyas, the tazziyas themselves being kept for the next year's celebration." (pp. 108–109).</ref>

In South Asia where ''ta'zīya'' refer to specifically to the miniature mausoleums used in processions held in Muharram. It all started from the fact that the great distance of India from Karbala prevented Indian Shi'is being buried near the tomb of Husayn or making frequent pilgrimages ([[ziyarat]]) to the tomb. This is the reason why Indian Shi'is established local karbalas on the subcontinent by bringing soil from Karbala and sprinkling it on lots designated as future cemeteries. Once the karbalas were established on the subcontinent, the next step was to bring Husayn's tomb-shrine to India. This was established by building replicas of Husayn's mausoleum called ''ta'zīya'' to be carried in Muharram processions. Thousands of ''ta'zīyas'' in various shapes and sizes are made every year for the months of mourning of Muharram and Safar; and are carried in processions and may be buried at the end of Ashura or Arba'een.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Behrens-Abouseif|first1=Doris|last2=Vernoit|first2=Stephen|title=Islamic Art in the 19th Century: Tradition, Innovation, And Eclecticism|year=2006|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9004144420|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A4q58Af5zAoC&q=taziya+in+India&pg=PA413|access-date=12 August 2016|language=en}}</ref>

===Hawza Seminary===
The [[Hawza]] are Islamic education institutions that are administered under the guidance of a Grand Ayatollah or group of scholars to teach Shia Muslims and guide them through the rigorous journey of becoming an Alim (a religious scholar). Initially Karbala's hawza consisted mostly of [[Iranian peoples|Iranians]] and Turkish scholars. The death of Sharif-ul-Ulama Mazandarani in 1830 as well as the repression of the Shia population by the Ottomans in 1843 both played a significant role in the relocation of many scholars to the city of [[Najaf]] and thus Najaf subsequently became the center of Shia Islamic leadership and education.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Shi'i Scholars of Nineteenth Century: The Ulama of Najaf and Karbala|last=Litvak |first=Meir|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-521-62356-1|location=United Kingdom|pages=51–141}}</ref> Today the Hawza Seminary still exists in Karbala (such as the School of Allamah Bin Fahd) but to a lesser extent in comparison to Najaf.
