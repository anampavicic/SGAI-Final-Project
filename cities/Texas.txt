[[File:Early indian west.jpg|thumb|Early Native American tribal territories]]Texas lies between two major cultural spheres of [[Pre-Columbian North America]]: the [[Southwestern tribes|Southwestern]] and the [[Plains Indians|Plains]] areas. [[Archaeologists]] have found that three major Indigenous cultures lived in this territory, and reached their developmental peak before the first European contact. These were:{{sfn|Richardson|Wintz|Boswell|Anderson|2021|p=9}} the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] from the upper [[Rio Grande]] region, centered west of Texas; the [[Mississippian culture]], also known as [[Mound Builders]], which extended along the [[Mississippi River Valley]] east of Texas; and the civilizations of [[Mesoamerica]], which were centered south of Texas. Influence of [[Teotihuacan]] in northern Mexico peaked around AD 500 and declined between the 8th and 10th centuries.

When Europeans arrived in the Texas region, the language families present in the state were Caddoan, [[Atakapa]]n, Athabaskan, [[Coahuiltecan]], and Uto-Aztecan, in addition to several language isolates such as [[Tonkawa language|Tonkawa]]. Uto-Aztecan Puebloan and [[Jumanos|Jumano]] peoples lived neared the Rio Grande in the western portion of the state and the Athabaskan-speaking Apache tribes lived throughout the interior. The agricultural, mound-building Caddo controlled much of the northeastern part of the state, along the [[Red River of the South|Red]], [[Sabine River (Texas–Louisiana)|Sabine]], [[Neches River|and Neches River]] basins.<ref name="Carter 1995">{{Cite book |last=Carter |first=Cecile Elkins |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1253386080 |title=Caddo Indians where we come from |date=1995 |publisher=University of Oklahoma Press |isbn=0-585-17049-5 |oclc=1253386080}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.7560/711501 |title="The Caddo Nation" |date=1993 |publisher=University of Texas Press |doi=10.7560/711501 |isbn=978-0-292-79978-3}}</ref> Atakapan peoples such as the [[Akokisa]] and [[Bidai]] lived along the northeastern Gulf Coast; the [[Karankawa people|Karankawa]] lived along the central coast.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Aten |first=Lawrence E. |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/254092448 |title=Indians of the upper Texas coast |date=1983 |publisher=Academic Pr |isbn=0-12-065740-6 |oclc=254092448}}</ref> At least one tribe of [[Coahuiltecan]]s, the [[Aranama people|Aranama]], lived in southern Texas.

The region was primarily controlled by the Spanish until the [[Texas Revolution]]. They were most interested in relationships with the Caddo, who were—like the Spanish—a settled, agricultural people. Several Spanish missions were opened in Caddo territory, but a lack of interest in Christianity among the Caddo meant that few were converted. Positioned between French Louisiana and Spanish Texas, the Caddo maintained relations with both, but were closer with the French.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Barr |first=Juliana |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1148108904 |title=Peace Came in the Form of a Woman : Indians and Spaniards in the Texas Borderlands. |date=November 2009 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |isbn=978-1-4696-0470-1 |oclc=1148108904}}</ref> After Spain took control of Louisiana, most of the missions in eastern Texas were closed and abandoned.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Galán |first=Francis X. |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1128731300 |title=Los Adaes : the first capital of Spanish Texas |year=2020 |publisher=Texas A&M University Press |isbn=978-1-62349-878-8 |oclc=1128731300}}</ref> The United States obtained Louisiana following the 1803 [[Louisiana Purchase]] and began convincing tribes to self-segregate from whites by moving west; facing an overflow of native peoples in Missouri and Arkansas, they were able to negotiate with the Caddo to allow several displaced peoples to settle on unused lands in eastern Texas. These included the [[Muscogee]], [[Houma people|Houma Choctaw]], [[Lenape]] and [[Mingo|Mingo Seneca]], among others, who came to view the Caddoans as saviors.<ref name="Glover">Glover, William B.

Several outbreaks of violence between Native Americans and Texans started to spread in the prelude to the Texas Revolution. Texans accused tribes of stealing livestock.

In 1821, the [[Mexican War of Independence]] included the Texas territory, which became part of Mexico.{{sfnp|Weber|1992|p=300}} Due to its low population, the territory was assigned to other [[administrative divisions of Mexico|states and territories of Mexico]]; the core territory was part of the state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]], but other parts of today's Texas were part of [[Tamaulipas]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], or the Mexican Territory of [[Santa Fe de Nuevo México]].{{sfnp|Manchaca|2001|p=162}}

Like most of the South, the Texas economy was devastated by the War. However, since the state had not been as dependent on slaves as other parts of the South, it was able to recover more quickly. The culture in Texas during the later 19th century exhibited many facets of a frontier territory. The state became notorious as a haven for people from other parts of the country who wanted to escape debt, war tensions, or other problems. "Gone to Texas" was a common expression for those fleeing the law in other states. Nevertheless, the state also attracted many businessmen and other settlers with more legitimate interests.<ref>{{cite web|last=Pettit|first=Gwen|title=Between the Creeks|url=https://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth752794/m2/1/high_res_d/Between%20_the_Creeks_by_Gwen_Pettit_compiled_by_Melinda_Fisher.pdf|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=texashistory.unt.edu|quote=The Southern states, especially the hills of Tennessee and Alabama, were impoverished; war tensions still split neighborhoods. Soon, empty houses had crude signs that stated that the former inhabitants had "Gone to Texas." Church records, also, had the phrase, "Gone to Texas" by numerous names on their roles. So many families left Maury County, Tenn., to settle in eastern Collin County, just across East Fork, that several communities, such as Culleoka, have names directly from south Maury County. That group joined relatives that had come here in the 1850s. Most new immigrants had some link to Collin County, which brought them here. They stayed with relatives and friends until they could find a place to settle. Landowners recruited farmers from the old states by persuading relatives and former neighbors to come. However, numerous families, in the pioneer tradition, loaded their children and belongings in a wagon and headed toward the unknown west. Clarksville, Bonham and Dallas newspapers reported how many wagons passed through each day and how many were camped on the "jockey yards" waiting to find a place to settle. Some of these had sold farms and had money to buy land, but most of these immigrants became tenant farmers and worked on shares.}}</ref>

The cattle industry continued to thrive, though it gradually became less profitable. Cotton and lumber became major industries creating new economic booms in various regions. Railroad networks grew rapidly as did the port at Galveston as commerce expanded. The lumber industry quickly expanded and was Texas' largest industry prior to the 20th century.<ref>{{cite web|title= Lumber Industry|url=https://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/entries/lumber-industry|access-date=December 28, 2020|publisher=TSHA |work=Handbook of Texas |first1= Robert S. |last1=Maxwell |orig-date=1976 |date=February 15, 2012 |quote=But relatively, the industry's status is far below its dominant position at the beginning of the twentieth century.

Henry Ford chartered an ocean liner to transport himself and dozens of other activists across the Atlantic, where they lobbied neutral governments to embrace a peace plan they would press on the warring powers. These Americans, like most critics of the war elsewhere in the world, wanted to create a new global order based on cooperative relationships between nation states and their gradual disarmament. Militarism, they argued, isolated peoples behind walls of mutual fear and loathing. Until April 1917, this formidable coalition of idealists—or realists—did much to keep the nation at peace. They may even have had a majority of Americans on their side until just weeks before Congress, at Wilson's behest, voted to declare war. To prevent that from happening, peace activists pressed for a national referendum on the question, confident that "the people" would recoil from fighting and paying the bills in order to help one group of European powers conquer another.}}</ref>

The size and unique history of Texas make its regional affiliation debatable; it can be considered a Southern or a Southwestern state, or both. The vast geographic, economic, and cultural diversity within the state itself prohibits easy categorization of the whole state into a [[List of regions of the United States|recognized region of the United States]]. Notable extremes range from [[East Texas]] which is often considered an extension of the [[Deep South]], to [[Trans-Pecos|Far West Texas]] which is generally acknowledged to be part of the [[Southwestern United States|interior Southwest]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.texasmonthly.com/the-daily-post/is-texas-southern-western-or-truly-a-lone-star/ |website=[[Texas Monthly]] |title=Is Texas Southern, Western, or Truly a Lone Star? |last=Nova Lomax |first=John |date=March 3, 2015 |access-date=September 6, 2016}}</ref>

Texas is the southernmost part of the Great Plains, which ends in the south against the folded [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] of Mexico. The [[continental crust]] forms a stable [[Mesoproterozoic]] [[craton]] which changes across a broad continental margin and transitional crust into true [[oceanic crust]] of the Gulf of Mexico. The oldest rocks in Texas date from the Mesoproterozoic and are about 1,600&nbsp;million years old.<ref>{{cite web|title=Geology|url=https://www.nhnct.org/geology/geo1.html|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=nhnct.org}}</ref>

Although Texas permits cities and counties to enter "interlocal agreements" to share services, the state does not allow [[consolidated city-county]] governments, nor does it have [[metropolitan government]]s. Counties are not granted [[home rule]] status; their powers are strictly defined by state law. The state does not have townships—areas within a county are either incorporated or unincorporated. Incorporated areas are part of a municipality. The county provides limited services to unincorporated areas and to some smaller incorporated areas. Municipalities are classified either "general law" cities or "home rule".<ref>{{cite thesis |last=McDonald |first=John V. |title=An Analysis of Texas' Municipal Home Rule Charters Since 1994" |date=August 2000 |publisher=Texas State University |url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/arp/124/ |access-date=October 14, 2008 |archive-date=March 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304010149/http://ecommons.txstate.edu/arp/124/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> A municipality may elect home rule status once it exceeds 5,000 population with voter approval.<ref>{{cite web|title=Home Rule |url=https://centertexas.org/city-council/home-rule|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=centertexas.org}}</ref>

{{Main|Culture of Texas}}
{{See also|List of Texas symbols}}
[[File:Mission San Antonio aka Alamo.jpg|thumb|[[Alamo Mission in San Antonio|The Alamo]] is one of the most recognized symbols of Texas.|left]]

Historically, Texas culture comes from a blend of mostly Southern [[Southern United States|(Dixie)]], Western (frontier), and Southwestern [[Southwestern United States|(Mexican/Anglo fusion)]] influences, varying in degrees of such from one intrastate region to another. A popular food item, the [[breakfast burrito]], draws from all three, having a soft flour tortilla wrapped around bacon and scrambled eggs or other hot, cooked fillings. Adding to Texas's traditional culture, established in the 18th and 19th centuries, immigration has made Texas a [[melting pot]] of cultures from around the world.<ref>{{Cite news|date=October 5, 1982|title=A California-style migration stirs up Texas melting pot|work=Christian Science Monitor|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1982/1005/100528.html|access-date=December 28, 2020|issn=0882-7729}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=November 24, 2017|title=Can Houston move past the 'melting pot'?|url=https://www.houstonchronicle.com/local/gray-matters/article/Can-Houston-move-past-the-melting-pot-12377720.php|access-date=December 28, 2020|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|language=en-US |last1=Aquila |first1=Dominic A. }}</ref>

Texas has made a strong mark on national and international pop culture. The entire state is strongly associated with the image of the [[cowboy]] shown in [[westerns]] and in [[country western music]]. The state's numerous oil tycoons are also a popular pop culture topic as seen in the hit TV series [[Dallas (1978 TV series)|''Dallas'']].<ref>{{cite news|last=Arnold|first=Richard|title=40 years on from the TV series, Dallas is much more than oil barons and big hats|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/texas/articles/tv-series-dallas-attractions/ |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220110/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/texas/articles/tv-series-dallas-attractions/ |archive-date=January 10, 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|access-date=December 28, 2020|website=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]|date=August 2, 2018|language=en-GB}}{{cbignore}}</ref>

The internationally known slogan "[[Don't Mess with Texas]]" began as an anti-littering [[advertising campaign|advertisement]]. Since the campaign's inception in 1986, the phrase has become "an identity statement, a declaration of Texas swagger".<ref>{{cite news |last=Fernandez |first=Manny |title=Not to Be, Um, Trifled With, Texas Guards Its Slogans |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/us/not-to-be-um-trifled-with-texas-guards-its-slogans.html?_r=0 |access-date=December 29, 2013 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=September 14, 2013}}</ref>

The [[judiciary of Texas]] is among the most complex in the United States, with many layers and overlapping jurisdictions.

The [[Texas Ranger Division]] of the [[Texas Department of Public Safety]] is a [[police|law enforcement agency]] with statewide [[jurisdiction]]. Over the years, the Texas Rangers have investigated crimes ranging from [[Murder in Texas law|murder]] to political corruption. They have acted as [[riot police]] and as detectives, protected the Texas governor, tracked down fugitives, and functioned as a paramilitary force. The Texas Rangers were unofficially created by [[Stephen F. Austin]] in 1823 and formally constituted in 1835.

The Texas constitution defines the responsibilities of county governments, which serve as agents of the state. Commissioners court and court judges are elected to serve as the administrative arm. Most cities in the state, those over 5,000 in population, have [[home-rule]] governments.

The Democratic Party dominated [[Politics of Texas|Texas politics]] from the turn of the 20th century, imposing racial segregation and white supremacy.

The state's conservative White voters began to support Republican presidential candidates by the mid-20th century.
