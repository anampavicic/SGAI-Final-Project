During the early Mughal era, Sialkot was made part of the ''subah,'' or "province", of Lahore.<ref name=":6" /> According to Sikh tradition, [[Guru Nanak]], the founder of [[Sikhism]], visited the city,<ref name="Dhillon">Dhillon, Iqbal S.

During the [[Akbar]] era, Sialkot's ''[[pargana]]'' territory was placed in the ''jagir'' [[Jagir|custodianship]] of [[Raja Man Singh]], who would repair the city's fort, and sought to increase its population and develop its economy.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4y9zAAAAMAAJ&q=sialkot+akbar|title=Punjab, the land of beauty, love, and mysticism|last=Quddus|first=Syed Abdul|date=1992|publisher=Royal Book Co.|isbn=9789694071305}}</ref> In 1580 [[Yousuf Shah Chak]] of [[Kashmir]] sought refuge in the city during his exile from the Valley of Kashmir.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2U9uAAAAMAAJ&q=sialkot+jehangir|title=The Kachhwahas under Akbar and Jahangir|last=Khan|first=Refaqat Ali|date=1976|publisher=Kitab Pub.

===Cityscape===
Sialkot's core is composed of the densely populated old city, while north of the city lies the vast colonial era [[Sialkot Cantonment]] – characterised by wide streets and large lawns. The city's industries have evolved in a "ribbon-like" pattern along the cities main arteries,<ref name="anwar"/> and are almost entirely dedicated to export.<ref name="anwar"/> The city's sporting good firms are not concentrated in any part of the city, but are instead spread throughout Sialkot.<ref name="anwar"/> Despite the city's overall prosperity, the local government has failed to meet Sialkot's basic infrastructure needs.<ref name="Dinh"/>

== Economy ==
Sialkot is a wealthy city relative to the rest of Pakistan, with a GDP (nominal) of $13 Billions and a per capita income in 2021 estimated at $18500.<ref name="anwar">{{cite book|last1=Anwar|first1=Nausheen|title=Infrastructure Redux: Crisis, Progress in Industrial Pakistan & Beyond|date=2014|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781137448170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fNUaBgAAQBAJ&q=sialkot&pg=PT84|access-date=11 October 2017}}</ref> The city was considered to be one of [[British India]]'s most industrialised cities,<ref name="anwar" /> though its economy would later be largely decimated by violence and capital flight following the [[Partition of India|Partition]].<ref name="anwar" /> The city's economy rebounded, and Sialkot now forms part of the relatively industriazised region of northern Punjab that is sometimes referred to as the ''Golden Triangle.''<ref name=":11" />

Sialkot has been noted by Britain's ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine as a "world-class manufacturing hub" with strong export industries.<ref name="economist" /> As of 2017, Sialkot exported US$2.5&nbsp;billion worth of goods which is equal to 10% of Pakistan's total exports (US$25&nbsp;billion).<ref name="economi" /> 250,000 residents are employed in Sialkot's industries,<ref name="anwar" /> with most enterprises in the city being small and funded by family savings.<ref name="Dinh" /> Sialkot's Chamber of Commerce had over 6,500 members in 2010, with most active in the leather, sporting goods, and surgical instruments industry.<ref name="Dinh" /> The [[Sialkot Dry Port]] offers local producers quick access to Pakistani Customs, as well as to logistics and transportation.<ref name="economist" /> [[File:Bab_ay_Sialkot.jpg|thumb|Sialkot Gate]]

Despite being cut off from its historic economic heartland in [[Kashmir]], Sialkot has managed to position itself into one of Pakistan's most prosperous cities, exporting up to 10% of all Pakistani exports.<ref name=economist/> Its sporting goods firms have been particularly successful, and have produced items for global brands such as [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]], [[Reebok]], and [[Puma (brand)|Puma]].<ref name="anwar"/> Balls for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] were made by [[Forward Sports]], a Sialkot-based company.<ref name=FIFA/>

Sialkot's business community has joined with the local government to maintain the city's infrastructure, as the local government has limited capacity to fund such maintenance.<ref name="anwar"/> The business community was instrumental in the establishment of Sialkot's Dry Port in 1985,<ref name="Dinh">{{cite book|last1=Dinh|first1=Hinh|title=Tales from the Development Frontier: How China and Other Countries Harness Light Manufacturing to Create Jobs and Prosperity|date=2011|publisher=World Bank|isbn=9780821399897}}</ref> and further helped re-pave the city's roads.<ref name="economist" /> Sialkot's business community also largely funded the [[Sialkot International Airport]]—opened in 2011 as Pakistan's first privately owned public airport.<ref name=economist/>

Sialkot is also the only city in Pakistan to have its very own commercial airline, [[AirSial|Airsial]].

Sialkot is also the world's largest centre of surgical instrument manufacturing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fairmedtrade.org.uk|title=BMA – Fair Medical Trade|website=www.fairmedtrade.org.uk|access-date=3 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308134934/http://www.fairmedtrade.org.uk/|archive-date=8 March 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Sialkot was first noted to be a centre of metalwork in the 1890s, and the city's association with surgical instruments came from the need to repair, and subsequently manufacture, surgical instruments for the nearby Mission hospital. By the 1920s, surgical instruments were being manufactured for use throughout [[British India]], with demand boosted by further by [[World War II]].<ref name=EP />

The city's surgical instrument manufacturing industry benefits from a clustering effect, in which larger manufacturers remain in close contact with smaller and specialised industries that can efficiently perform contracted work.<ref name=EP>{{cite web|url=http://emergingpakistan.gov.pk/sectors/surgical-goods/ |title=Surgical Goods         |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200628033619/http://emergingpakistan.gov.pk/sectors/surgical-goods/ |date=19 December 2017|archive-date=28 June 2020|website=Emerging Pakistan, Government of Pakistan website|access-date=30 January 2022|url-status=dead}}</ref> The industry is made up of a few hundred small and medium size enterprises, supported by thousands of subcontractors, suppliers, and those providing other ancillary services. The bulk of exports are destined for the United States and [[European Union]].<ref name=EP />
