The '''Eastern Cape''' ({{langx|xh|iMpuma-Kapa}}; {{langx|af|Oos-Kaap}} {{IPA|af|ˈuəs.kɑːp|}}) is one of the nine [[provinces of South Africa]]. Its capital is [[Bhisho]], and its largest city is [[Gqeberha]] (Port Elizabeth). Due to its climate and nineteenth-century towns, it is a common location for tourists. It is also known for being home to many anti-apartheid activists, including [[Nelson Mandela]].

The second largest province in the country (at 168,966&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) after the [[Northern Cape]], it was formed in 1994 out of the [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] homelands or [[bantustan]]s of [[Transkei]] and [[Ciskei]], together with the eastern portion of the [[Cape Province]]. The central and eastern part of the province is the traditional home of the indigenous [[Xhosa people]]. In 1820 this area, which was known as the [[Xhosa Kingdom]], began to be settled by Europeans who originally came from [[England]], [[Scotland]] and [[Ireland]].

==History==
The Eastern Cape province was formed in 1994, incorporating areas from the former Xhosa homelands of the [[Transkei]] and [[Ciskei]], together with what was previously part of the [[Cape Province]]. This resulted in several anomalies, including the fact that the Province has four supreme courts (in [[Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown]] (Makhanda), [[Port Elizabeth]] (Gqeberha), Bhisho and [[Mthatha]], and had enclaves of [[KwaZulu-Natal]] in the province. The latter anomaly has fallen away with amendments to municipal and provincial boundaries.

The Xhosa Kingdom was one of the most powerful kingdoms in Africa, and had all states in the Eastern Cape as tributaries. Any group, people, or tribe that recognised the Xhosa Kingdom as Paramouncy became Xhosa, practiced Xhosa culture and used isiXhosa as their main language. Some of the tribes that fall under the category of Xhosa people include: AmaMpondo, AbaThembu, AmaMpondomise, AmaHlubi, AmaBhaca, AmaXesibe, AmaBomvana and more.{{Original research inline|date=May 2019}}

===European settlers===
{{main | Graaff-Reinet | 1820 Settlers}}
In the late 18th century the [[Dutch Cape Colony]] slowly expanded eastwards from its original centre around Cape Town. This led to the establishment in 1786 of the Dutch settlement of [[Graaff-Reinet]] – named for the [[Governor of the Dutch Cape Colony|Governor of the Cape Colony]] [[Cornelis Jacob van de Graaff|Cornelius Jacob van de Graaff]] (in office: 1785–1791) and for his wife Hester Cornelia van de Graaff (née Reynet). Later, during the [[Napoleonic wars]] of 1803–1815, [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] took control of the [[Colony of the Cape of Good Hope|Cape Colony]] (1806) and encouraged British citizens to migrate there as a means to boost the British population{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} in the area.

From the early 1800s until the formation of the [[Union of South Africa]] in 1910, the Eastern Cape saw colonisation by British [[human migration|migrant]]s. English [[settler]]s established most of the towns, naming them either for places in England or for the original founders. [[British colonisation]] saw schools, churches, hospitals, town centres and government buildings built to speed up development.{{citation needed|date=July 2021}} Some of the older European settlements include [[Fort Beaufort]] (1814), [[Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown]] (1812), [[Port Elizabeth]] (1820), [[Salem, Eastern Cape|Salem]] (1820), [[Bathurst, Eastern Cape|Bathurst]] (1820), [[East London, Eastern Cape|East London]] (1836), [[Paterson, Eastern Cape|Paterson]] (1879), [[Cradock, Eastern Cape|Cradock]] (1814), Fort Beaufort (1816) and [[King William's Town, Eastern Cape|King William's Town]] (1836).

== Geography ==
[[image:ISS059-E-91096 - View of South Africa.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The southern part of the province seen from [[International Space Station|space]]. Various mountain ranges in the [[Cape Fold Belt]] are visible, besides [[Cape Recife]] and [[Cape St. Francis]].]]
{{See also|List of cities and towns in the Eastern Cape}}

The Eastern Cape gets progressively wetter from west to east. The west is mostly semiarid [[Karoo]], except in the far south, which is temperate rainforest in the Tsitsikamma region. The coast is generally rugged with interspersed beaches. Most of the province is hilly to very mountainous between [[Graaff-Reinet]] and Rhodes including the [[Sneeuberge]] (English: Snow Mountains), [[Stormberg Mountains|Stormberge]], [[Winterberg, Eastern Cape|Winterberge]] and [[Drakensberg]] (English: Dragon Mountains). The highest point in the province is [[Ben Macdhui (South Africa)|Ben Macdhui]] at 3001 m. The east from [[East London, South Africa|East London]] and [[Komani, Eastern Cape|Queenstown]] towards the [[KwaZulu-Natal]] border – a region known previously as [[Transkei]] – is lush grassland on rolling hills, punctuated by deep gorges with intermittent forest.

Eastern Cape has a [[coast]] on its east which lines southward, creating shores leading to the south Indian Ocean. In the northeast, it borders the following [[districts of Lesotho]]:
*[[Mohale's Hoek District]] – west of Quthing
*[[Quthing District]] – between Mohale and Qacha's Nek
*[[Qacha's Nek District]] – east of Quthing

Domestically, it borders the following provinces:
*[[Western Cape]] – west
*[[Northern Cape]] – northwest
*[[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] – north
*[[KwaZulu-Natal]] – far northeast

=== Climate ===
Climate is highly varied. The west is dry with sparse rain during winter or summer, with frosty winters and hot summers. The area [[Tsitsikamma]] to [[Makhanda, Eastern Cape|Grahamstown]] receives more precipitation, which is also relatively evenly distributed and temperatures are mild. Further east, rainfall becomes more plentiful and humidity increases, becoming more subtropical along the coast with summer rainfall. The interior can become very cold in winter, with heavy snowfalls occasionally occurring in the mountainous regions between [[Molteno, Eastern Cape|Molteno]] and [[Rhodes, Eastern Cape|Rhodes]].

== Demographics ==
As of the [[2022 South African census|2022 census]], the Eastern Cape had a population of 7,230,204, an increase of 10.2% from the prior census in [[2011 South African census|2011]].  It is the fourth-most populous of South Africa's nine provinces.  The median age is 27, an increase of 5 years from 2011.<ref name="2022 census3">{{cite web |title=Statistical Release - Census 2022 |url=https://census.statssa.gov.za/assets/documents/2022/P03014_Census_2022_Statistical_Release.pdf |access-date=2024-08-22 |website=statssa.gov.za}}</ref>

=== Race/Ethnicity ===
In the 2022 census, 85.7% of the population described themselves as [[Bantu peoples of South Africa|Black African]], 7.6% as [[Coloureds|Coloured]], 5.6% as [[White South Africans|White]] and 0.5% as [[Indian South Africans|Indian/Asian]].<ref name="2022 census3" />  A large majority of Black African people in the province are [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], with 78.8% of residents in Eastern Cape identifying as Xhosa as of 2011. Unlike most of [[South Africa]], a substantial proportion of the [[White South Africans|White]] population is of [[British diaspora in Africa|British descent]].  Roughly half of [[White South Africans]] in Eastern Cape are English-speakers of British descent while the other half  are of [[Boer]]/[[Afrikaner]] ancestry.  Eastern Cape is one of only two provinces in [[South Africa]] where Whites of British descent outnumber Boers/Afrikaners, the other being [[KwaZulu-Natal]].

===Agriculture===
There is much fertile land in the Eastern Cape, and agriculture remains important. The fertile [[Langkloof]] Valley in the southwest has large deciduous [[fruit orchard]]s. In the Karoo there is widespread sheep farming.

The Alexandria-Makhanda area produces pineapples, chicory and dairy products, while coffee and tea are cultivated at Magwa. People in the former Transkei region are dependent on cattle, maize and sorghum-farming. An olive nursery has been developed in collaboration with the [[University of Fort Hare]] to form a nucleus of olive production in the Eastern Cape.

Domestic stock farming is slowly giving way to game farming on large scale. [[Eco-tourism]] is resulting in economic benefits, and there is lower risk needed to protect wild, native game against drought, and the natural elements. Habitat loss and poaching pose the greatest problems.

The area around [[Stutterheim]] is being cultivated extensively with timber plantations.

The basis of the province's [[fishing industry]] is [[squid]], some recreational and commercial fishing for line fish, the collection of marine resources, and access to line-catches of [[hake]].

===Industry===
With three import/export harbours and three airports offering direct flights to the main centres, and an excellent road and rail infrastructure,{{citation needed|date=March 2019}} the province has been earmarked as a key area for growth and economic development in modern South Africa.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

The two major industrial centres, [[Port Elizabeth]] and [[East London, South Africa|East London]] have well-developed economies based on the automotive industry. [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] and [[Volkswagen]] both have major assembly lines in the Port Elizabeth area, while East London is dominated by the large [[DaimlerChrysler]] plant, now known as Mercedes-Benz South Africa.<ref>{{cite web |date=20 February 2014 |title=VWSA steps up production as export demand grows |url=https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/economy/vwsa-steps-up-production-as-export-demand-grows-1650463%26grqid%3D9EbjLP3w%26s%3D1%26hl%3Den-ZA |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200715064456/https://www.iol.co.za/business-report/economy/vwsa-steps-up-production-as-export-demand-grows-1650463%26grqid%3D9EbjLP3w%26s%3D1%26hl%3Den-ZA |archive-date=15 July 2020 |access-date=18 May 2020 |publisher=iol.co.za}}</ref>

Environmental-friendly projects include the Fish River Spatial Development Initiative, the Wild Coast SDI, and two industrial development zones, the East London Industrial Development Zone and the Coega IDZ near Port Elizabeth. Coega is the largest infrastructure development in post-[[apartheid]] South Africa. The construction of the deepwater [[Port of Ngqura]] was completed and the first commercial ship anchored in October 2009.<ref>{{cite web |title=New liquid bulk tank farm at port of ngqura a step closer – Transnet |url=https://www.rnews.co.za/article/26559/new-liquid-bulk-tank-farm-at-port-of-ngqura-a-step-closer-transnet |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200713164710/https://www.rnews.co.za/article/26559/new-liquid-bulk-tank-farm-at-port-of-ngqura-a-step-closer-transnet |archive-date=13 July 2020 |access-date=18 May 2020 |publisher=rnews.co.za}}</ref>

Other sectors include finance, real estate, business services, wholesale and retail trade, eco-tourism (nature reserves and game ranches) and hotels and restaurants.

==Law and government==
{{main|Politics of the Eastern Cape}}

The Eastern Cape provincial government is based in [[Bhisho]], the provincial capital. The [[Eastern Cape Division]] of the [[High Court of South Africa]] is situated in Makhanda (Grahamstown), with local seats in Gqhebera (Port Elizabeth), East London, and Bhisho.

Like South Africa's other provinces, the Eastern Cape has a parliamentary system of government, with the [[Premier of the Eastern Cape|premier of the province]] elected by the [[Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature]].  The premier then selects the members of the [[Executive Council (South Africa)|Executive Council]] (cabinet).  The current premier is [[Oscar Mabuyane]] of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC).

The provincial legislature is elected every five years by a system of [[party-list proportional representation]].

== Health ==
The province is served by big medical centres such as [[Cecilia Makiwane Hospital]] which is a large, government-funded hospital near the city of [[East London, South Africa|East London]] that also serves as a tertiary teaching hospital. [[Frere Hospital]] is another large, provincial government-funded hospital near East London which also serves as a tertiary teaching hospital. These hospitals offer many specialty departments such as an ARV clinic for HIV/AIDS in adults and children. Both hospitals are affiliated with Lilitha Nursing College and Walter Sisulu University.

While the Eastern Cape has many hospitals and private clinics, the province has some of the worst health outcomes and service indicators in South Africa. Some of this can be attributed to staff shortages, with a report indicating that 67% of the 27 monitored facilities have insufficient staff.<ref>{{Cite web |date=May 2018 |title=State of Provincial Healthcare System Spotlight on Eastern Cape |url=https://www.tac.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tac-eastern-cape-state-of-health-report-may-2018.pdf |website=TAC (Treatment Action Campaign)}}</ref>

Rural residents in the Eastern Cape face worse health outcomes than those who reside in the larger towns or cities. This is due to a number of conditions such as lack of healthcare resources, lack of means to access healthcare resources, high unemployment, and poverty. Illiteracy is also a problem in rural communities, which further limits positive health outcomes.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Mncedisi Willie |first1=Michael |last2=Maqbool |first2=Mudasir |date=March 2023 |title=Access to public health services in South Africa's rural Eastern Cape Province |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/369659101 |website=Applied Sciences Research Periodicals}}</ref>

HIV/AIDS and Tuberculosis are also ongoing issues in the region. In 2017, the Eastern Cape had a TB incidence of 839/100,000 people, which was higher than South Africa's estimated prevalence of 737/100,000.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=5 April 2022 |editor-last=Isaakidis |editor-first=Petros |title=Association of HIV infection and antiretroviral therapy with the occurrence of an unfavorable TB treatment outcome in a rural district hospital in Eastern Cape, South Africa: A retrospective cohort study |pmc=8982869 |last1=Van De Water |first1=B.
