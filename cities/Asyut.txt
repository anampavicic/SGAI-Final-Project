=== Ancient Asyut ===
[[File:Yuny and Renenutet.jpg|thumb|Statue of the chief royal scribe [[Yuny]] of Asyut and his wife Renenutet, 1290–1270 BCE early Dynasty 19.]]
Ancient Asyut was the capital of the Thirteenth [[Nome (Egypt)|Nome]] of [[Upper Egypt]] (''Lycopolites Nome'') around 3100 BC. It was located on the western bank of the [[Nile]]. The two most prominent [[Egyptian pantheon|gods]] of [[ancient Egypt]]ian Asyut were [[Anubis]] and [[Wepwawet]], both funerary deities.

During the [[First Intermediate Period of Egypt|First Intermediate Period]], the rulers of "''Zawty''" ([[Khety I (nomarch)|Khety I]], [[Tefibi]], and [[Khety II (nomarch)|Khety II]]) were supporters of the [[Herakleopolis Magna|Herakleopolitan]] kings, of whose domain the Nome formed the southern limits. The conflict between this Nome and the southern Nomes under the rule of the [[Eleventh Dynasty of Egypt|Eleventh Dynasty]] ended with the victory of [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and the decline of Asyut's importance.
[[File:Skull of Khety.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Skull of Khety from Asyut, 1950 BCE.]]
Lycopolis has no remarkable ruins, but in the excavated chambers of the adjacent rocks [[mummies]] of [[African golden wolf|wolves]] have been found, confirming the origin of its name, as well as a tradition preserved by [[Diodorus Siculus]],<ref>(ii. 88; comp. Aelian. ''Hist. An.'' x. 28)</ref> to the effect that an [[Ethiopia]]n army, invading Egypt, was repelled beyond the city of [[Elephantine]] by packs of wolves. [[Osiris]] was worshipped under the symbol of a wolf at Lycopolis. According to a myth, he had come "from the shades" as a wolf to aid [[Isis]] and [[Horus]] in their combat with [[Set (deity)|Typhon]].<ref>(Champollion, ''Descript. de l'Egypte'', vol. i. p. 276; Jollois, ''Egypte'', vol. ii. ch. 13.)</ref> Other ancient Egyptian monuments discovered in Asyut include; the Asyut [[necropolis]] (west of the modern city), tombs which date to dynasties [[Ninth dynasty of Egypt|Nine]], [[Tenth dynasty of Egypt|Ten]] and [[Twelfth dynasty of Egypt|Twelve]], and the [[Ramesside Period|Ramessid]] tombs of [[Siese]] and [[Amenhotep (Asyut)|Amenhotep]].

In [[Graeco-Roman]] times, there was a distinct dialect of [[Coptic language|Coptic]] spoken in Asyut, known as "[[Lycopolitan]]", after the Greek name for the city. Lesser-used names for this dialect are "Sub-Akhmimic" and "Assiutic".

A large [[Asyut Treasure|Byzantine Treasure]] was discovered near the city in the early twentieth century and is now dispersed amongst a number of museums in the West. The [[hoard]] is composed of some of the most elaborate jewellery to survive from late [[Ancient history|antiquity]].

Asyut was at the end of the [[40 Day Road]] that connected the city to [[Darfur]] through the Selima and [[Kharga Oasis|Kharga Oases]]. The history of the road, known by local herders as ''[[Darb El Arba'īn|Darb al-Arba'in]]'', goes back over 700 years. It was used as a pathway for great caravans of up to 12,000 camels at its peak in the 14th century.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Stephens|first1=Angela|title=Riding the Forty Days' Road|url=https://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199705/riding.the.forty.days.road.htm|website=AramcoWorld|access-date=18 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118234855/https://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/199705/riding.the.forty.days.road.htm|archive-date=18 November 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

== Modern Asyut ==
Today, the city of Asyut has almost 400,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citypopulation.de/Egypt.html|title=Egypt|publisher=Citypopulation.de|access-date=22 November 2014}}</ref> It is the Egyptian city with one of the highest [[Copt|Coptic Christian]] concentrations of approximately 50%.<ref>{{Cite web|title = The Coptic Orthodox Church in action - Al-Ahram Weekly|url = http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/News/2256/-/-.aspx|website = weekly.ahram.org.eg|access-date = 2016-02-18}}</ref> It is also home to the [[Assiut University]], one of the largest [[University|universities]] in [[Egypt]], to the [[Assiut Barrage]], and to the [[Lillian Trasher]] [[Orphanage]].

The city is one of the only cities in the world that still makes [[Tulle bi telli|silver appliqué-work shawls]] and is home to a large textile industry. The city also produces fine pottery, inlaid woodwork, and rugs.<ref name=brittanica>{{cite web|title=Asyūṭ Egypt|url=http://www.britannica.com/place/Asyut-Egypt|website=Encyclopædia Britannica|access-date=18 November 2015}}</ref>

Asyut is the terminus of the Ras Shukheir-Asyut [[oil pipeline]], the terminus of the [[Cairo]]-Asyut [[gas pipeline]] and the beginning of the proposed Asyut-[[Qena]] gas pipeline, the last two being part of the Nile Valley Gas Company Pipeline Project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theodora.com/pipelines/north_africa_oil_gas_products_pipelines_map.html |title=North Africa Pipelines map - Crude Oil (petroleum) pipelines - Natural Gas pipelines - Products pipelines |publisher=Theodora.com/pipelines |access-date=2011-05-19| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110526151701/http://www.theodora.com/pipelines/north_africa_oil_gas_products_pipelines_map.html| archive-date= 26 May 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Aysut is next to the Aysut Dam across the Nile river in the neighboring port of [[Al-Hamra, Egypt|Al-Hamra]]. The dam was built in 1902 and a hydroelectric plant was added in the 1980s.<ref name="brittanica" />

=== Coptic Catholic Eparchy ===
On 10 August 1947, a Coptic Catholic eparchy ([[Eastern Catholic]] Diocese) of Assiut (or Lycopolis) was established on southern Egyptian territory split off from the [[Coptic Catholic Eparchy of Luqsor]], each [[suffragan]] of [[Coptic Catholic Patriarch of Alexandria]]. Its episcopal see is the [[cathedral]] of the Mother of Divine Love, in Assyut.

The city of Asyut is sandwiched between two mountain ranges of about 600m height. There is also a lowering in elevation in mid [[Egypt]], from the [[Mediterranean]] and the [[Red Sea]]. This gives the city and nearby towns and villages the similar properties of a [[continental climate]], meaning that the city has harsh and chilly [[cold]] [[winter]] weather, and very hot but non-humid [[summer]]s. During summer the temperature can exceed {{convert|42|°C}}. Yet, in winter Asyut gets below {{convert|0|°C}} temperatures during the night and [[frost]] can easily form, while [[hail]] or [[snow]] are rare because of the low average of the city's [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] and general low [[humidity]].
