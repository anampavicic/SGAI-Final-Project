==Name==
Xiamen had always been known as [[Tong'an]] County since antiquity until [[Republic of China]] Era of the 20th century, followed by administrative zoning restructures and naming changes.

'''Tong'an''' County first appeared in [[Han dynasty]] records. [[Xiamen Island]] was described as '''Jiahe Islet''' of Tong'an County during the Song dynasty (960–1279). It received its present name from the Xiamen Defense Castle erected on the island by Zhou Dexing in 1387 during the [[Ming dynasty]] to meet the needs of coastal defense.<ref name=zgddc>{{cite book |script-title=zh:中国古今地名大词典 |page=2855 |isbn=9787532617432|year=2005 |author1=戴均良 |publisher=上海辞书出版社 }}</ref> The name was formerly written using, {{zh|c=下門|s=|t=|p=|poj=|l=Lower Gate}}, and then changed into {{zh|c=廈門|s=|t=|p=|poj=|l=Mansion Gate}} or "Gate of China".

After the fall of the Ming dynasty, [[Koxinga|Zheng Chenggong]], or Koxinga, a Ming loyalist and general, occupied Xiamen island as an anti-[[Qing dynasty|Qing]] base. In 1650, the seventh year of Emperor [[Shunzhi Emperor|Shunzhi]] of the Qing dynasty, Zheng set a military base in Xiamen island and changed its name into {{zh|c=思明州|s=|t=|p=Sīmíng zhōu|poj=Su-bêng chiu|l=Think [[Ming]] (dynasty) Prefecture}}, meaning "Remembering the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]]".{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

When its port prospered under the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]], especially during the reign of [[Kangxi Emperor|Emperor Kangxi]], the island's name was changed to {{zh|c=廈門|s=|t=|p=Xiàmén|poj=Ē-mn̂g / Ē͘-mûi|l=}} again.

The island's name of 思明 was in return restored after the [[Xinhai Revolution]] that inaugurated the [[Republic of China (mainland)|republic]] in 1912.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

The island's name of 廈門 was restored in 1933, along with Xiamen being administratively planned as a city, the first of its kind in Fujian province. [[Siming District|思明]] continues to be used as the name of one of its districts.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

Xiamen is the [[Chinese tones|atonal]] [[pinyin]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] of the characters' pronunciation in [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]]. It has also been romanized as '''Hiamen'''.<!--not a typo-->{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} The older English name "Amoy" was based on the same name's pronunciation in the [[Zhangzhou dialect]] of [[Hokkien language|Hokkien]], ''Ē͘-mûi''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Chia |first1=Caroline |title=Hokkien Theatre Across The Seas: A Socio-Cultural Study |date=2019 |publisher=Springer |location=Singapore |isbn=978-981-13-1834-4 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GKR5DwAAQBAJ&pg=PA59 |language=en}}</ref>

Xiamen is a [[sub-provincial city]] in southeastern [[Fujian]] whose urban core grew up from the port of Xiamen on southern [[Xiamen Island]], now located within [[Siming District]]. It now also includes [[Gulangyu Island]] and the rugged coast of the mainland from the northeast bank of the [[Jiulong River]] in the west to the islands of [[Xiang'an]] in the east. Xiamen Island lies about one degree north of the [[Tropic of Cancer]].<ref name=cancer>{{harvp|Pitcher|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K8QIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 26]}}.</ref> It is divided between [[Huli District]] in the north and [[Siming District]] in the south. Siming also includes Gulangyu. Its mainland territory is divided among [[Haicang District|Haicang]], [[Jimei District|Jimei]], [[Tong'an District|Tong'an]], and [[Xiang'an District|Xiang'an]] districts.

In the 19th century, Xiamen's harbor on Yundang Bay was considered one of the world's great natural harbors.{{cn|date=March 2024}} [[Land reclamation]] has since been used to fill in the mouth of this inlet, turning it into Siming District's Yundang Lake. The municipal government is located on other reclaimed land beside it.

The nearest point of [[Lieyu|Liehyu]] in the [[Kinmen]] Islands, [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), lies only {{convert|6|km|sp=us|0}} off Xiamen Island.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www1.china.com.cn/chinese/ChineseCommunity/138060.htm |script-title=zh:金门，离大陆真近 |script-work=zh:中国网 |date=2002-04-22 |access-date=11 June 2011 |archive-date=25 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325134702/http://www1.china.com.cn/chinese/ChineseCommunity/138060.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Xiamen Island is the fourth largest island in Fujian province. It became a peninsula after the completion of the seawall in 1955. Xiamen waters include Xiamen Port, Outer Harbor Area, Maluan Bay, Tongan Bay, Jiulong River's estuary area and the waterway on the east side. Outside the Xiamen Port, Big Kinmen, Little Kinmen, Dadan, Erdan and other island are arranged in a horizontal line. Inside, it has Xiamen Island, Gulangyu Island and other island barriers, making it a good natural port protected from storms.

===Climate===
Xiamen has a [[monsoon]]al [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), characterised by long, hot and humid summers (but moderate compared to much of the rest of the province) and short, mild and dry winters. The warmest month is July, with a 24-hour average of {{convert|28.3|°C|sp=us|1}}, and the coolest month is January, averaging {{convert|13.1|°C|sp=us|1}}; the annual mean is {{convert|21.1|°C|sp=us|1}}. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from {{convert|0.1|°C|sp=us|0}} on [[January 2016 East Asia cold wave|24 January 2016]] to {{convert|39.6|°C|sp=us|0}} on 9 August 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdc.cma.gov.cn/dataSetLogger.do?changeFlag%3DdataLogger |title=无标题文档 |access-date=18 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318113757/http://cdc.cma.gov.cn/dataSetLogger.do?changeFlag=dataLogger |archive-date=18 March 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=39.6°C！厦门气温历史最高纪录，整个厦门空调之外，全是桑拿_利奇马 |url=https://www.sohu.com/a/332697882_100199564#:~:text=%E5%8C%97%E4%BA%AC%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B42019%E5%B9%B48,%E6%97%B6%E9%97%B4%E6%8C%81%E7%BB%AD%E4%BA%86100%E5%88%86%E9%92%9F%E3%80%82 |access-date=2024-10-06 |website=www.sohu.com}}</ref> Spring, both by humidity and percentage of sunshine, is the dampest season but typhoons in late summer and early autumn can make the latter period wetter overall. Summer and autumn are marked by comparatively sunny conditions, while autumn is warm and dry. The annual rainfall is {{convert|1301|mm|sp=us|0}}. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 29% in March to 58% in July, the city receives 1,893 hours of bright sunshine annually. Frost occurs very rarely, and the last snowfall in the city took place in January 1893, when snow also fell at [[Guangzhou]], Macau, in the inland parts of Hong Kong and in the hills of [[Taipei]].

The area is known within China for its relatively low pollution.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-10-least-polluted-cities-map-2013-2 |title=These 10 Cities Are Your Best Bet at Escaping China's Epic Pollution Problem |first=Rob |last=Wile |website=[[Business Insider]] |access-date=17 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816144612/http://www.businessinsider.com/chinas-10-least-polluted-cities-map-2013-2 |archive-date=16 August 2016 |url-status=live  }}.</ref>

==History==
The area of Xiamen was largely bypassed by the [[Qin Empire|Qin]] and [[Han Empire|Han]] conquests and colonization of [[Guangdong]], which passed west of Fujian down the [[Lingqu Canal]] between the [[Xiang River|Xiang]] and [[Li River (Guangxi)|Li]] [[rivers of China|rivers]]. It was first organized as [[Tong'an County]] in AD{{nbsp}}282 under the [[Jin Dynasty (265-420)|Jin]], but it lost this status soon afterwards. Tong'an County was again established in 933 under the [[Later Tang dynasty|Later Tang]].

The settlement on the southeastern shore of Xiamen Island{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} (now part of [[Siming District]]) developed as a seaport under the [[Song dynasty|Song]], although legal foreign trade was restricted to nearby [[Quanzhou]], which administered the area. In 1387, attacks by the [[Wokou|"Japanese" or "dwarf" pirates]]—many of them actually disaffected Chinese—prompted the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] to protect the harbor with the fortress that gave Xiamen its name. The [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] first reached Xiamen in 1541. After the [[fall of the Ming]] to the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] in 1644, [[Southern Ming]] loyalists including [[Koxinga]] used Xiamen as a base from which to launch attacks against the invading Qing-aligned Han [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] from 1650 to 1660.<ref>{{citation |first=Lynn A. |last=Struve |title=The Southern Ming 1644–1662 |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1984 |page=181 }}.</ref> In 1661, Koxinga drove the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] from [[Dutch Formosa|Taiwan]] and [[Kingdom of Tungning|moved his operations there]].

However, despite the Canton system which restricted Western trade to the port of Guangzhou, the [[Spanish Filipino|Spanish]] were still allowed to trade in Xiamen. However, the [[Spanish Filipino|Spanish]] rarely used this privilege as Chinese traders would ship their goods from Xiamen to [[Manila]] and vice versa, which was more profitable for both sides.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Greenberg |first1=Michael |title=British Trade and the Opening of China 1800–1842 |date=1969 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=47}}</ref>

By the 19th century, the [[Chinese city walls|city walls]] had a circumference of around {{convert|9|mi|sp=us|0}}, with an inner and outer city divided by an inner wall and a ridge of hills surmounted by a well-built fort.{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} The inner harbor on Yundang Bay was also well fortified{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} and these defenses were further strengthened upon the outbreak of the [[First Opium War]].<ref name=backagain/> Nonetheless, Xiamen [[Battle of Amoy|was captured]] in 1841 between [[Battle of Canton (May 1841)|Guangzhou]] and [[Capture of Chusan (1841)|Zhoushan]].

As the primary international port for Fujian, particularly [[Zhangzhou]] and its hinterland,{{sfnp|''EB''|1878}} Xiamen became a center of China's [[History of tea#Global expansion|tea trade]], with hundreds of thousands of tons shipped yearly to Europe and the Americas.<ref name=4thnot1st>{{harvp|Pitcher|1893|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=K8QIAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA30 30]}}.</ref> [[Amoy dialect|Its local dialect]] influenced [[#Dialect|a variety of translations of Chinese terms]].

By the 20th century, the local export economy had collapsed due to the success of British tea plantations in India.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} During the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] and the early 20th century, many southern Fujianese emigrated to [[Taiwan]] and [[Southeast Asia]], such as in the [[Philippines]], [[Indonesia]], [[Brunei]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], etc., spreading [[Hokkien language]] and culture [[Overseas Chinese|overseas]]. Some 350,000 overseas Chinese currently trace their ancestry to Xiamen.<ref name=autogenerated2/> Some of this diaspora later returned: an estimated 220,000 Xiamen residents are returning overseas Chinese and their kin.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{cite web |url=http://www.xmqs.xm.fj.cn/qw/qx-xm/qx-xm.htm |script-title=zh:"侨乡厦门" 厦门市华侨博物院 |website=xmqs.xm.fj.cn |access-date=11 June 2011 |archive-date=12 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212193929/http://www.xmqs.xm.fj.cn/qw/qx-xm/qx-xm.htm |url-status=dead }} Accessed 11 June 2011</ref> Others continue to help fund universities and cultural institutions in Xiamen.

At the time of the [[Xinhai Revolution]], the native population of the city was estimated at 300,000 and the foreign settlement at 280.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} After the establishment of the [[Republic of China (mainland)|Republic of China]], the area around Xiamen was renamed [[Siming County]]. Xiamen's trade during the period was largely conducted through [[Japanese Taiwan|Taiwan]],{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} which had been seized by [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] during the [[First Sino-Japanese War]]. The Japanese subsequently claimed Fujian as their [[sphere of influence]] during the colonial squabbling over China.{{sfnp|''EB''|1911}} Japan occupied Xiamen Island from May 1938 to September 1945 during [[Second Sino-Japanese War|World War II]]. During the Japanese occupation, the city provided some shipments of rice to the Portuguese Colony of [[Macau]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Wartime Macau Under the Japanese Shadow|last=Gunn|first=Geoffrey|publisher=Hong Kong University Press|year=2016|isbn=978-988-8390-51-9|location=Hong Kong|pages=85}}</ref> In the late phases of the [[Chinese Civil War]] that followed, the [[Chinese Communist Party|Communists]] captured Xiamen and Gulangyu in October 1949 but [[Battle of Guningtou|failed to capture Kinmen]]. The same year, Xiamen became a provincially administered city ({{lang|zh|省辖市}}).

In 1955 and 1958, mainland China escalated [[Cold War]] political tensions by shelling nearby islands from Xiamen in what became known as the [[First Taiwan Strait Crisis|First]] and [[Second Taiwan Strait Crisis]]. The Nationalists responded by reinforcing Kinmen and shelling Xiamen. The [[Gaoji Causeway]] built from 1955 to 1957 notionally transformed Xiamen Island into a peninsula, and so it was termed in the [[Great Leap Forward|heady propaganda]] of the time.{{cn|date=March 2024}} Due to political tensions, the eastern half of Xiamen Island and much of the Fujian Coast facing the offshore islands remained undeveloped in the 1960s and 1970s.{{cn|date=March 2024}} The Water Police and [[Post-Office]] were situated directly across the water from the American embassy.

When [[Deng Xiaoping]] initiated his [[Opening Up Policy]], Xiamen was made one of the [[Special economic zones of China|first four special economic zones]] in 1980, with special investment and trade regulations attracting [[direct foreign investment|foreign investment]], particularly from overseas Chinese.<ref>Brown, Bill & Brown, Sue, [http://www.amoymagic.com/bhistory.htm "Brief Background of Xiamen (Amoy)"]</ref> The construction of Huli Export Processing Zone in [[Xiamen Special Economic Zone|Xiamen Special Economic]] Zone was officially started on 15 October 1981. In 1984, [[Xiamen Special Economic Zone|Xiamen Special Economic]] Zone was expanded from an area of 2.5 square kilometers of Huli to 131 square kilometers of the whole island. The city grew and prospered. In June 2010, [[Xiamen Special Economic Zone]] was expanded to the whole Xiamen city, and four districts outside Xiamen Island – including Jimei, Haicang, Tongan and Xiang'an – were included into the zone. After this expansion, the area of [[Xiamen Special Economic Zone]] reached 1,573 square kilometers, 11 times larger than before.

Answering the call of the Belt and Road Initiative, Xiamen has focused on dealing with international competition with a more confident attitude and to facilitate the construction of the important hub city of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.{{clarify|date=October 2019}}{{cn|date=March 2024}}

In 2001, the governments of mainland China and Taiwan agreed to initiate the "[[Three Links#Limited liberalization|Three Mini-Links]]" and restored ferry, commercial, and mail links between the mainland and offshore islands. Trade and travel between Xiamen and Kinmen was restored and later expanded to include direct air travel to [[Taiwan Island]]. In 2010, travelers between Xiamen and Kinmen made 1.31&nbsp;million trips.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://biz.ifeng.com/city/xiamen/zoududaxiamen/chengshizatan/xiamen_2011_06/02/36652_0.shtml |script-title=zh:"厦门港为赴台自由行开通夜航 拉动厦漳泉旅游资源整合" |script-work=zh:厦门商报 |via=[[Ifeng]] Business |date=2 June 2011 |language=zh-cn |access-date=11 June 2011 |archive-date=12 August 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812124441/http://biz.ifeng.com/city/xiamen/zoududaxiamen/chengshizatan/xiamen_2011_06/02/36652_0.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref>
