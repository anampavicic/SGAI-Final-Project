==History==
{{Main|History of Lafayette, Louisiana}}

=== Colonization and settlement ===
The [[Atakapa|Attakapa]] Native Americans inhabited this area at the time of the first European encounter. French colonists founded the first European settlement, ''Petit Manchac'', a trading post along the Vermilion River.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=Historic Lafayette: An Illustrated History of Lafayette & Lafayette Parish|last=Martin|first=Michael|publisher=Historical Publishing Network|year=2007|isbn=9781893619760|location=San Antonio, Texas|pages=5–7, 10, 11}}</ref> In the mid-to-late eighteenth century, numerous [[Acadians|Acadian]] refugees settled in this area,<ref>{{Cite web|title=Timeline of the Acadians|url=https://www.cbc.ca/acadian/timeline.html|access-date=July 31, 2021|website=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation}}</ref> after being [[Expulsion of the Acadians|expelled]] from [[Canada]] after [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]] defeated [[France]] in the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=From Acadian to Cajun - Jean Lafitte National Historical Park and Preserve|url=https://www.nps.gov/jela/learn/historyculture/from-acadian-to-cajun.htm|access-date=2021-07-31|publisher=U.S. National Park Service|language=en}}</ref> They intermarried with other settlers, forming what became known as [[Cajuns|Cajun]] culture, which maintained use of the French language and adherence to the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=History of Cajun Country|url=http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jmeaux/cajun.html|access-date=2021-07-31|website=pages.cs.wisc.edu|publisher=University of Wisconsin–Madison}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Cajuns|url=https://64parishes.org/entry/cajuns|access-date=2021-07-31|website=64 Parishes|language=en}}</ref>

=== Municipal incorporation ===
Jean Mouton, an Acadian settler, donated land to the Roman Church for construction of a small Catholic chapel at this site. In 1824, this area was selected for the Lafayette Parish seat and was named Vermilionville,<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|last=Griffin|first=Harry|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5is-IIyu5N8C|title=The Attakapas Country: A History of Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|date=23 September 2010|publisher=Pelican Publishing|pages=33|isbn=9781455600465}}</ref> for its location on the river; in 1836, the [[Louisiana State Legislature]] approved its incorporation.

The area was initially developed by Europeans for agriculture, primarily [[Plantation|sugar plantations]], which depended on the labor of numerous [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved Africans]] and [[African Americans]]. They made up a large percentage of the antebellum population.<ref name=":0" /> According to [[United States census|U.S. census]] data in 1830, some 41 percent of the population of Lafayette Parish was enslaved.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1830/1830b.pdf|title=Abstract of the Fifth Census of the United States|publisher=House of Representatives, United States of America|year=1832|location=Duff Green|publication-place=Washington DC}}</ref> By 1860, the enslaved population had increased to 49.6 percent. Some [[free people of color]] lived in Lafayette Parish, as well;<ref>{{Cite web|title=Free People of Color in Louisiana|url=https://lib.lsu.edu/sites/all/files/sc/fpoc/history.html|access-date=2021-07-31|publisher=Louisiana State University}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Ambroise|first=Trevian|title=From the shadows of the free people of color, a look into the historic Freetown|url=https://www.thevermilion.com/opinion/from-the-shadows-of-the-free-people-of-color-a-look-into-the-historic-freetown/article_873bfe18-2e67-11e9-9ce9-93aeb2dad728.html|access-date=2021-07-31|website=The Vermilion|language=en}}</ref> they made up 3 percent to a low of 2.4 percent between 1830 and 1860.

In 1884, Vermilionville was renamed for [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|General Lafayette]], a French aristocrat who had fought with and significantly aided the [[Continental Army]] during the [[American Revolutionary War]].<ref name=Niles>''Niles' Weekly Register'', BALTIMORE, June 26, 1824; LAFAYETTE</ref> The city and parish economy continued to be based on agriculture into the early 20th century. After the [[American Civil War]], most of the labor was done by [[Freedman|freedmen]], who worked as [[Sharecropping|sharecroppers]]. From the 1930s, mechanization of agriculture began to reduce the need for farm workers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Slavery by Another Name|last=Blackmon|first=Douglas}}</ref>

=== Growth and consolidation ===
By 1898, the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] was established in the city as the Southwestern Louisiana Industrial Institute. It opened in 1901, and changed its name to the University of Southwestern Louisiana in 1960.<ref>{{Cite web|date=2012-12-20|title=The University|url=https://louisiana.edu/about-us/history/university|access-date=2021-07-31|website=University of Louisiana at Lafayette|language=en}}</ref> The university's current name was chosen in 1999.

In the 1940s, after oil was discovered in the parish, the petroleum and natural gas industries expanded to dominate the economy. By 2018, Lafayette had the highest number of [[Oil and gas law in the United States|oil and natural gas]] industry workers in the state.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|date=2018-05-08|title=Louisiana's Oil and Natural Gas Insutry – Still the Foundation of Lafayette's Economy|url=https://growlouisianacoalition.com/lafayette/|access-date=2021-07-31|publisher=Grow Louisiana Coalition|language=en-US}}</ref>

The consolidation of the city and parish has been the subject of continuous public debate over the years. In 2011, a charter commission recommended deconsolidation, though parish voters rejected the recommendation. In 2018, voters separated the single city–parish council into a city council to represent the city of Lafayette and a parish council to represent Lafayette Parish. The mayor-president is still elected parishwide. In 2021, the city council passed a resolution calling for another charter commission to look at amendments to the charter and, if necessary, deconsolidation. The Lafayette Parish Council did not agree to the charter commission proposal.<ref name=":21" /> Public works and other services, such as land use and plat review, are operated by the Lafayette Consolidated Government to serve the city of Lafayette and unincorporated areas of Lafayette Parish, and by contract some of the area municipalities.
