'''Agadez Region ''' is one of the seven [[regions of Niger]]. At {{convert|667,799|km2|mi2}}, it covers more than half of Niger's land area, and is the largest region in the country, as well as the [[list of the largest country subdivisions by area|largest African state subdivision]]. The capital of the department is [[Agadez]].

==History==
The region is a centre for [[palaeontology]], with numerous dinosaur skeletons being found here, including the ''[[Ouranosaurus nigeriensis]]''.<ref name="Bradt"/> Cave painting and the remains of ancient human settlements are also located here.<ref name="Bradt"/> Tuareg peoples began migrating to the region from the mid-8th century.<ref name="Bradt"/> From the mid-15th century to the early 20th, much of the region was under the control of the [[Sultanate of Agadez]], except for a period when the area came under the rule of the [[Songhai Empire]] in the 1500s.<ref name="Bradt"/>

The region suffered with the advent of French colonialism as power shifted away to the southwest; Tuareg disaffection with French rule resulted in the [[Kaocen revolt]] in 1916–17.<ref name="Bradt"/> This process continued following Niger's independence in 1960; local Tuareg saw little recompense from the [[uranium]] mining boom in Arlit in the 1970s, and Agadez Region was struck by repeated droughts and famines.<ref name="Bradt"/> Since then there have been two Tuareg rebellions: from [[Tuareg rebellion (1990–1995)|1990–95]] and [[Tuareg rebellion (2007–2009)|2007–09]].<ref name="Bradt"/> In recent years the region has also been affected by [[Insurgency in the Maghreb (2002–present)|an insurgency in the Maghreb]] by Islamist groups.

==Geography==
The Agadez Region borders [[Algeria]] ([[Tamanrasset Province]] and [[Illizi Province]]) and [[Libya]] ([[Murzuq District]]) to the north, [[Chad]] ([[Tibesti Region]]) to the east, [[Diffa Region]], [[Zinder Region]], [[Tahoua Region]] and [[Maradi Region]] to the south, and [[Mali]] ([[Kidal Region]]) to the west. It is by far the largest region of the country, representing 52% of the total area of Niger. The region is dominated by the [[Sahara desert]], and includes the vast [[Ténéré]] portion of that desert, as well as dune seas such as the [[Erg of Bilma]].<ref name="Bradt">Geels, Jolijn, (2006) ''Bradt Travel Guide - Niger'', pgs. 157-200</ref> The [[Aïr Mountains]], the tallest peaks in Niger, are also located here.<ref name="Bradt"/> The [[Djado Plateau]] is located in the far north.

===Settlements===
[[Agadez]] is the regional capital; other major settlements include [[Aderbissinat]], [[Arlit]], [[Assamakka]], [[Bilma]], [[Dirkou]], [[Iferouane]], [[In-Gall]], [[Madama]], [[Séguedine]], [[Tchirozerine]], [[Tegguiada In Tessoum]] and [[Timia]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://reliefweb.int/map/niger/niger-region-dagadez-carte-r-f-rentielle-25-juin-2014 |title= Niger: Region D'agadez: Carte référentielle (25 Juin 2014) |format = [[PDF]] | publisher = [[UNOCHA]] | access-date = 2 November 2019}}</ref>

==Demographics==
Agadez has a large area but is sparsely populated. Its 487,620 inhabitants (as per the 2012 census)<ref name="Niger at Geohive">[http://www.geohive.com/cntry/niger.aspx Niger at Geohive] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420070414/http://www.geohive.com/cntry/niger.aspx |date=2015-04-20 }}</ref> account for only 2.8% of the total population of Niger, with a population density of {{convert|1.9|PD/sqmi|PD/km2|disp=flip}}. Much of its population comprises [[nomad|nomadic or semi-nomadic]] peoples, including [[Arabs]], [[Fula people|Fulani]], [[Kanuri people|Kanuri]], [[Dazaga]] [[Toubou]] and various [[Tuareg]] groups. The [[Tagdal language]] and [[Tasawaq language]], thought to be mixed [[Songhay languages|Songhai]]-Tuareg languages, are also spoken.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.ethnologue.com/country/ne/languages| title = Languages of Niger | publisher = [[Ethnologue]] | access-date = 24 October 2019}}</ref>{{Historical populations|1977|124,985|1985|208,828|2001|321,639|2012|487,620|align=none|footnote=source:<ref>[http://www.citypopulation.de/en/niger/cities/ Niger: Administrative Division population statistics]</ref>}}

==Economy==

[[File:Timia valley.JPG|thumb|right|The Aïr Mountains near Timia]]

Traversed for centuries by the [[Trans-Saharan trade]] routes, the oasis towns of the Aïr and the eastern [[Kaouar|Kaouar Cliffs]] are known for their gardens, salt manufacture, and [[Date palm|date]] cultivation. [[Arlit]] is the centre of Niger's [[uranium]] industry, a prominent economic sector in the region with uranium pits and mines operated by foreign companies providing substantial revenue for the country. The French discovered Niger's first uranium deposits in the Tim Mersoi Basin of the Agadez Region in 1958 and since then French companies such as [[Orano|Areva]] have maintained a large footprint in the region, employing a large quantity of locals.<ref name="Klare2012">{{cite book|author=Michael Klare|title=The Race for What's Left: The Global Scramble for the World's Last Resources|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NkBE6cFdin8C&pg=PT192|date=13 March 2012|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-1-4299-7330-4|pages=192–}}</ref><ref name="USA2008">{{cite book|author=IBP USA Staff|title=Niger Mining Laws and Regulations Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HHx-zQEACAAJ|date=3 March 2008|publisher=International Business Publications|isbn=978-1-4330-7798-2|pages=67–}}</ref> Depressed uranium prices since the 1980s have hit the region hard, though uranium remains one of the main foreign exchange earners for the country and a main export.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Niger (NER) Exports, Imports, and Trade Partners {{!}} OEC |url=https://oec.world/en/profile/country/ner |access-date=2022-05-25 |website=OEC - The Observatory of Economic Complexity |language=en}}</ref> The region is less poor than other regions of the country.

Agadez had historically been one of the main centres of tourism in Niger, with visitors attracted by the desert scenery, archaeological sites and the Air Mountains. However Tuareg rebellions and activities of Islamist militants in Agadez region have severely reduced the numbers of tourists, with most third party governments advising against travel to the region.<ref>{{citation |url= https://smartraveller.gov.au/Countries/africa/west/Pages/niger.aspx|title=Australian DFAT Travel Advice - Niger |date=5 October 2019}}</ref>
