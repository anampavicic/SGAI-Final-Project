==Name==
The name Miass is taken from the Bashkirs ({{langx|ba|Мейәс}}), the indigenous inhabitants of these places, with the root of the word meaning "water" or "friend".

==History==

It was founded in 1773 as a copper mining factory.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} During the 19th century, the development was driven by the discovery of the richest [[gold]] deposits in the Urals. Average annual extraction of gold from the Miass region was about {{convert|640|kg}}. In the mid-19th century, the volume of gold mining went down, and the development of Miass also slowed. Town status was granted to Miass in 1923.{{citation needed|date=June 2010}} In 1941, an automobile factory (which still operates as [[UralAZ]]) was built.

==Administrative and municipal status==
