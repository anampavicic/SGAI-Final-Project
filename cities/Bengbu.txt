These are further divided into 74 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Township level|township-level divisions]], including 36 [[town of China|towns]], 19 [[Township (People's Republic of China)|townships]] and 19 [[Subdistricts of China|subdistrict]]s.

==Geography==
Bengbu is located in the southeast of the [[North China Plain]], on the [[Huai River]]. The built up urbanized area is divided into two parts: greater Bengbu on the south bank of the river and little Bengbu on the north bank. Dragon Lake is on the East side of the urbanized area. On the other side of the lake is the university district, containing four institutions of higher learning.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-01-18 |title=蚌埠城市概况 |trans-title=Bengbu City Profile |url=https://www.bengbu.gov.cn/zjbb/csgk/index.html |access-date=2024-06-15 |website=Bengbu City People's Government |language=zh}}</ref>

==Climate==
The area has a four-season [[humid subtropical climate]] with strong [[monsoon]] influences ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cwa''), cool, sometimes cold, winters, and hot and humid summers. The area lies in a climatic transition zone, as it is on the Qin Ling−Huai River boundary between the climatic regimes of northern and southern China. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from {{convert|2.0|°C|1}} in January to {{convert|28.1|°C|1}} in July, and the annual mean is {{convert|15.76|°C|1}}. A majority of the annual precipitation occurs from June to August. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 44% in March to 56% in August, the city receives 2,168 hours of bright sunshine annually.

==History==

In ancient times, the [[Dongyi]] peoples inhabited this area and were collectively known as the Huaiyi after the Huai River. During the late Western Zhou Period and the early [[Spring and Autumn period]], the Dongyi became increasingly sinicized. During the late Spring and Autumn period, the once-powerful Dongyi state of [[Xu (state)|Xu]] was pressured from all directions and destroyed through a series of wars with its neighbors, such as the [[Chu (state)|Chu]] State and the [[Wu (state)|Wu]] State. Another Dongyi State was the small Zhongli State, which was a part of the Huaiyi Confederation led by the State of Xu. Tombs belonging to the royalty of the Zhongli State were discovered in excavations between 2005 and 2008 near [[Fengyang]]. Eventually, the Huaiyi peoples were assimilated.

Bengbu has always been a hub of water and land communications in Anhui province, and a major distribution centre for the Huai basin.

In 1948, during the [[Chinese Civil War]], the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] [[People's Liberation Army]] won a decisive victory over [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] (KMT) forces near Bengbu, in the [[Huaihai Campaign]].

==Economy==

===Industry===
Bengbu is now a famous food city in Anhui province. Food-related industries account for 44% of the city's industrial production. The city's other industries include engineering works, textiles, glass making, chemicals, and electronics. The light textile holds an important position in the industrial structure.

===Agriculture===
Bengbu is teeming with oil, vegetables, meat and aquatic products. Bengbu is a large producer of peanuts. The pomegranates from Huaiyuan (a county of Bengbu), have a high reputation in China. In Wuhe (a county of Bengbu), the crabs are also famous.

==Culture==
Pollution in the village of Qiugang, a suburb of Bengbu, was the subject of the 2010 film ''[[The Warriors of Qiugang]]'', an [[83rd Academy Awards]] nominee. The [[Bengbu Stadium]] is located in the city. The 15,000-capacity stadium is used mostly for football matches.

==Food==
Bengbu cuisine, along with northern Anhui cuisine, is similar to cuisine from nearby [[Henan]] and [[Shandong]] provinces, as well as [[Xuzhou cuisine]] in northern [[Jiangsu]] province.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Transportation==
[[File:China Railways DF11 0350.jpg|thumb|right|A [[China Railways DF11]] diesel locomotive at Bengbu Railway Station]]
The city is on the [[Jinghu Railway]], with hourly direct trains to Beijing, Shanghai and other large cities. [[Bengbu South Railway Station]] is served by the high-speed Beijing-Shanghai Railway.

[[Bengbu Airport]], which was relocated from the city's central urban area around the turn of the 21st century, is now operated only as a military airport. A new commercial airport is under construction in the district north of the Huai river.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Construction on the [[Bengbu Metro]] started in 2019 and is due to be completed in 2023.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}
