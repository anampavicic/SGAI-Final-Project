== History ==
[[Image:kangar map.jpg|thumb|Kangar Map]]Kangar existed from about 350 years ago, that is since 1653 when Kota Sena was built as the administrative centre for the 14th [[Kedah Sultanate#List of rulers|Sultan of Kedah]], [[Muhyiddin Mansur Shah of Kedah|Sultan Muhyiddin Mansor Shah]]. Kangar was then a land port or ''pengkalan'' where boats and tongkangs anchor at the confluence of Perlis River, which runs through Kangar town to [[Kuala Perlis]].<ref name="MPK"/>

The name ''Kangar'' was derived from a type of tree. It was here at the port that trading was done, under a big tree that gave shade and respite to the traders. This tree that became a "witness" to many business deals was called ''Pohon Kangar''. Every trader and merchant who came and went to this place began calling it the ''Pohon Kangar'' Port, in honour of the tree.<ref name="MPK"/>

The [[Han Chinese]], the second largest community in Kangar are primarily [[Penang Hokkien|Hokkien]] speaking, with the language serving as the [[lingua franca]] of the city's Chinese population. In addition, significant knowledge of [[Mandarin language|Mandarin]] and [[Malaysian English|English]] is also present amongst them.

Other languages spoken in Kangar includes [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayali]] as well as [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Hindi language|Hindi]] among the Kangar Indian population and [[Southern Thai language|Southern Thai]] by the [[Malaysian Siamese|Kedah-Siamese]] community.
