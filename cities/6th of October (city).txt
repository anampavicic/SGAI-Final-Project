'''6th of October''' ({{langx|ar|السادس من أكتوبر|label=[[Modern Standard Arabic]]}} {{Transliteration|ar|Al Sādis Min Uktōber}}; {{langx|arz|ستة اكتوبر}} {{Transliteration|arz|Setta Oktōbar}}) is a city in the [[Giza Governorate]] of [[Egypt]]. It is a [[satellite city]], located adjacent to [[Giza]], and is part of the [[Greater Cairo]] region.<ref name = "NYT" >[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/25/world/africa/25egypt.html "To Catch Cairo Overflow, 2 Megacities Rise in Sand"] article by Thanassis Cambanis in ''[[The New York Times]]'' August 24, 2010. Retrieved August 25, 2010.</ref> 

The city served as the capital of the now-defunct [[6th of October Governorate]], which was dissolved in 2011. Established as a new city in the desert,<ref>Neil MacFarquhar, David Rohde, Aram Roston: [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/world/middleeast/13wealth.html?pagewanted=2&_r=1&ref=world Mubarak Family Riches Attract New Focus]. The New York Times, February 12, 2011, retrieved February 13, 2011</ref> it hosts many local students, as well as foreign students from the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf Arab states]], [[Jordan]], [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]] and [[Palestine]]. 

==History==
The settlement was established in 1979 by the 504th presidential decree of [[President of Egypt|Egyptian President]] [[Anwar Sadat]]. It is {{cvt|32|km|mi}} from the center of Cairo and {{cvt|17|km|mi}} from the great pyramids of Giza. Despite having many unfinished or vacant buildings, the city has a total area of {{cvt|482|km2|acre}} and is eventually expected to have six million residents.<ref name="NewUrban">{{cite web|title=6th October City|url=http://www.newcities.gov.eg/english/New_Communities/October/default.aspx|website=New Urban Communities Authority Portal|access-date=30 October 2016}}</ref>

It was announced as the capital of the 6th&nbsp;of October Governorate in April 2008. Following the governorate's dissolution in April 2011, in the wake of the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolution]], it was reincorporated into the [[Giza Governorate]], to which it had originally belonged.

The city is named after the date of commencement for [[Operation Badr (1973)|Operation Badr]], the 6th of October 1973, which began the [[Yom Kippur War|October War]]. The same date was chosen as Egypt's [[Armed Forces Day#Egypt|Armed Forces Day]].

==Climate==
[[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system]] classifies its climate as [[hot desert climate|hot desert]] (BWh). Its climate is very similar to [[Giza#Climate|Giza]] and [[Cairo#Climate|Cairo]], owing to its proximity to them. That being said, some places in 6th of October are a bit colder and windier than central Cairo and Giza city at night for several reasons. This is mainly because buildings as infrastructure tend to be more spaced out accompanied by more empty spaces allows for wind to pick for easily than the densely populated centre of Giza and Cairo. Additionally, the city was built in the desert which tends to be colder and drier than the damp humid area closer to the [[Nile]].
