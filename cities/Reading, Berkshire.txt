Reading is a major commercial centre, especially for information technology and insurance.<ref name="Good Growth for Cities 2013">{{cite web|url=http://www.pwc.co.uk/government-public-sector/good-growth/good-growth-for-cities-report-on-economic-wellbeing-uk-urban-areas.jhtml|title=Government & public sector|publisher=PwC|access-date=23 April 2014|archive-date=24 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140424131626/http://www.pwc.co.uk/government-public-sector/good-growth/good-growth-for-cities-report-on-economic-wellbeing-uk-urban-areas.jhtml|url-status=live}}</ref> It is also a regional retail centre, serving a large area of the Thames Valley with its shopping centres, including the [[The Oracle, Reading|Oracle]], the Broad Street Mall, and the pedestrianised area around Broad Street. It is home to the [[University of Reading]]. Every year it hosts the [[Reading and Leeds Festivals|Reading Festival]], one of England's biggest music festivals. Reading has a professional [[association football]] team, [[Reading F.C.]], and participates in many other sports.<!--only the most notable sports go in the lead section.-->

Reading dates from the 8th century. It was a trading and ecclesiastical centre in the [[Middle Ages]], the site of [[Reading Abbey]], one of the largest and richest monasteries of [[medieval England]] with royal connections, of which the 12th-century abbey gateway and significant ancient ruins remain. By 1525, Reading was the largest town in Berkshire, and tenth in England for taxable wealth. The town was seriously affected by the [[English Civil War]], with a major siege and loss of trade, but played a pivotal role in the [[Glorious Revolution]], whose only significant military action was fought on its streets. The 18th century saw the beginning of a major ironworks in the town and the growth of the [[brewing]] trade for which Reading was to become famous. The 19th century saw the coming of the [[Great Western Railway]] and the development of the town's brewing, baking and seed growing businesses, and the town grew rapidly as a [[manufacturing]] centre. Reading is also the county town of Berkshire.

===Origins===
[[File:Map of Redding by John Speed, 1611.jpg|thumb|right|The earliest map of Reading, published in 1611 by [[John Speed]]]]
[[File:View of Reading from Caversham by Joseph Farington, 1793.jpg|thumb|right|''View of Reading from [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]]'' by [[Joseph Farington]] in 1793]]
Occupation at the site of Reading may date back to the [[Roman Britain|Roman period]], possibly in the form of a trading port for [[Calleva Atrebatum]].{{sfn|Lawes Long|1836|p=11–13}} However, the first clear evidence for Reading as a settlement dates from the 8th century, when the town came to be known as ''Readingas''. The name probably comes from the ''[[Readingas]]'', an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] tribe whose name means ''Reada's People'' in [[Old English]]{{sfn|Cameron|1961|p=64}} (the Anglo-Saxons often had the same name for a place and its inhabitants). In late 870, an army of [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]] invaded the kingdom of [[Wessex]] and set up camp at Reading. On 4 January 871, in the [[Battle of Reading (871)|first Battle of Reading]], [[Ethelred of Wessex|King Ethelred]] and his brother [[Alfred the Great]] attempted unsuccessfully to breach the Danes' defences. The battle is described in the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'', and that account provides the earliest known written record of the existence of Reading. The Danes remained in Reading until late in 871, when they retreated to their winter quarters in [[London]].{{sfn|Phillips|1980|p=14–15}}{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364}}

After the [[Battle of Hastings]] and the [[Norman conquest of England]], [[William the Conqueror]] gave land in and around Reading to his foundation of [[Battle Abbey]]. In its 1086 [[Domesday Book]] listing, the town was explicitly described as a [[borough]]. The presence of six mills is recorded: four on land belonging to the king and two on the land given to Battle Abbey.{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364}} [[Reading Abbey]] was founded in 1121 by [[Henry I of England|Henry I]], who is buried within the Abbey grounds. As part of his endowments, he gave the abbey his lands in Reading, along with land at [[Cholsey]].{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364}}{{sfn|Slade|2001|p=1–16}}

Reading was a river crossing point: in 1312, King [[Edward II]] directed that its bridges should be kept in good order.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maxwell Lyte |first1=H.C. |title=Close Rolls, Edward II: November 1312 Pages 556-559 Calendar of Close Rolls, Edward II: Volume 1, 1307-1313.

The last [[abbot]], [[Hugh Faringdon]], was subsequently tried and convicted of high treason and [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in front of the Abbey Church.{{sfn|Slade|2001|p=17–25}}{{sfn|Fasham|Hawkes|1983}}

By 1525, Reading was the largest town in [[Berkshire]], and tax returns show that Reading was the tenth largest town in England when measured by taxable wealth. By 1611, it had a population of over 5000 and had grown rich on its trade in cloth, as instanced by the fortune made by local merchant [[John Kendrick (cloth merchant)|John Kendrick]].{{sfn|Hylton|2007|p=34–38}}{{sfn|Hylton|2007|p=51–52}} Reading played a role during the [[English Civil War]]. Despite its fortifications, it had a [[Cavalier|Royalist]] [[garrison]] imposed on it in 1642. The subsequent [[Siege of Reading]] by [[Roundheads|Parliamentary]] forces succeeded in April 1643.<ref>Barrès-Baker, Malcolm: ''The Siege of Reading: The Failure of the Earl of Essex's 1643 Spring Offensive''. Ottawa, EbooksLib, 2004 {{ISBN|1-55449-999-2}}</ref> The town's cloth trade was especially badly damaged, and the town's economy did not fully recover until the 20th century.{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364}}<ref>{{cite web | last = Ford | first = David Nash | work = Royal Berkshire History | publisher = Nash Ford Publishing | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_siege.html | title = The Siege of Reading | access-date = 27 April 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090307011752/http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_siege.html | archive-date = 7 March 2009 | url-status = dead }}</ref> Reading played a significant role during the [[Glorious Revolution]]: the [[Battle of Reading (1688)|second Battle of Reading]] was the only substantial military action of the campaign.{{sfn|Ditchfield|Page|1923|p=342–364}}<ref>{{cite web | last = Ford | first = David Nash | work = Royal Berkshire History | publisher = Nash Ford Publishing | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_broadst.html | title = The Battle of Broad Street | access-date = 27 April 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080926092425/http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_broadst.html | archive-date = 26 September 2008 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

The 18th century saw the beginning of a major iron works in the town and the growth of the [[brewing]] trade for which Reading was to become famous.{{sfn|Phillips|1980|p=84–89}} Reading's trade benefited from better designed [[Turnpike trusts|turnpike]] roads which helped it establish its location on the major coaching routes from London to [[Oxford]] and the [[West Country]]. In 1723, despite considerable local opposition, the Kennet Navigation opened the [[River Kennet]] to boats as far as [[Newbury, Berkshire|Newbury]]. Opposition stopped when it became apparent that the new route benefited the town.

===20th century===
The town continued to expand in the 20th century, annexing [[Caversham, Reading|Caversham]] across the [[River Thames]] in [[Oxfordshire]] in 1911. Compared to many other English towns and cities, Reading suffered little physical damage during either of the two [[world war]]s that afflicted the 20th century, although many citizens were killed or injured in the conflicts. One significant [[airstrike|air raid]] occurred on 10 February 1943, when a single [[Luftwaffe]] plane machine-gunned and bombed the town centre, resulting in 41 deaths and over 100 injuries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.readingmuseum.org.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAyADAANQB8AHwAVAByAHUAZQB8AHwAMAB8AA2 |title=Air Raid, February 1943 |work=[[Reading Museum]] |publisher=Reading Borough Council |access-date=13 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131003062921/http://www.readingmuseum.org.uk/GetAsset.aspx?id=fAAyADAANQB8AHwAVAByAHUAZQB8AHwAMAB8AA2 |archive-date=3 October 2013 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

[[Local government]] for the Borough of Reading is provided by [[Reading Borough Council]], a single level [[unitary authority]] without [[Civil parishes in England|civil parish]]es. However, some of the town of Reading's outer [[suburbs]] are in [[West Berkshire]] and [[Wokingham (borough)|Wokingham]] unitary authorities.

Reading's municipal boundaries do not include all of the surrounding [[suburb]]s. Some of these areas ([[Tilehurst]], [[Calcot, Berkshire|Calcot]], [[Earley]], [[Winnersh]] and [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley]]) are, at least partly, within [[West Berkshire]] or [[Wokingham Borough]]. This unusual configuration creates difficulties. The diminishing amount of land available and suitable for development within the borough's boundary can bring the council into conflict with its neighbours' development plans; this is exacerbated by the fact that the wards within the borough boundaries have tended to elect Labour councillors, while the suburban wards outside the borough have tended to vote Conservative or, latterly, Liberal Democrat. This particularly affects education (many schools have catchment areas that cross administrative boundaries), and transport. A perennial example is whether to construct a third road crossing of the [[Thames]], which [[South Oxfordshire]]'s politicians and residents oppose.<ref>{{cite web | publisher = South Oxfordshire District Council | url = http://www.southoxon.com/sites/default/files/Wokingham_BC_EM5.pdf | title = South Oxfordshire District Local Development Framework - Core Strategy Examination - Written Statement of Wokingham BC for the Exploratory Meeting on: Tuesday 17 May 2011 | access-date =14 June 2011 | date = 17 May 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120325170754/http://www.southoxon.com/sites/default/files/Wokingham_BC_EM5.pdf | archive-date = 25 March 2012 | url-status = dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Third Bridge | url = http://www.cadra.org.uk/Third_Bridge.asp | publisher = CADRA | access-date =4 October 2011 | date = August 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425044412/http://www.cadra.org.uk/Third_Bridge.asp | archive-date = 25 April 2012 | url-status = dead}}</ref> On this subject, [[Rob Wilson]], then [[Member of Parliament]] for [[Reading East (UK Parliament constituency)|Reading East]], said in a [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] debate in January 2006:<ref>{{cite web | publisher = Hansard | url = https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060111/halltext/60111h04.htm | title = Transport (Greater Reading) | access-date = 3 August 2006 | date = 11 January 2006 | archive-date = 14 September 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070914040040/http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060111/halltext/60111h04.htm | url-status = dead }}</ref>

{{Blockquote|However, the process has been painfully slow and it appears that, for every two steps forwards, there are three steps backwards—mainly because of the view of [[South Oxfordshire District Council|South Oxfordshire district council]], which is being incredibly parochial about this matter. Meanwhile, [[Reading Borough Council]] is adopting strategies that prioritise local traffic in Reading, obviously to the detriment of through traffic. We have now reached the point at which we desperately need direct Government intervention to break the logjam between those local authorities.}}

The centre of Reading is on a low ridge between the [[River Thames]] and [[River Kennet]], close to their [[confluence]], reflecting the town's history as a river port. Just above the confluence, the Kennet cuts through a narrow steep-sided gap in the hills forming the southern flank of the Thames [[flood plain]]. The absence of a flood plain on the Kennet in this [[defile (geography)|defile]] enabled the development of [[Wharf|wharves]]. The floodplains adjoining Reading's two rivers are subject to occasional flooding.<ref>{{cite web|title=2007 Floods photos|url=http://www.reading.gov.uk/council/strategies-plans-and-policies/EmergencyPlanning/Flooding/2007-floods/|publisher=Reading Borough Council|access-date=5 April 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521211047/http://www.reading.gov.uk/council/strategies-plans-and-policies/EmergencyPlanning/Flooding/2007-floods/|archive-date=21 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=July 2007 Flooding|url=http://www.reading.gov.uk/Documents/adviceandemergencies/Emergency-Planning/July_2007_flooding_report_Cabinet.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927181208/http://www.reading.gov.uk/Documents/adviceandemergencies/Emergency-Planning/July_2007_flooding_report_Cabinet.pdf |archive-date=27 September 2011 |url-status=live|publisher=Reading Borough Council|access-date=13 June 2011|date=29 October 2007}}</ref>

As Reading has grown, its suburbs have spread: to the west between the two rivers into the foothills of the [[Berkshire Downs]] as far as [[Calcot, Berkshire|Calcot]], [[Tilehurst]] and [[Purley on Thames|Purley]]; to the south and south-east on the south side of the [[River Kennet]] as far as [[Whitley Wood]] and [[Lower Earley]] and as far north of the [[Thames]] into the [[Chiltern Hills]] as far as [[Caversham Heights]], [[Emmer Green]] and [[Caversham Park Village]]. Outside the central area, the floors of the valleys containing the two rivers remain largely unimproved [[floodplain]]. Apart from the [[M4 motorway|M4]] curving to the south there is only one road across the Kennet flood plain. All other routes between the three built-up areas are in the central area.<ref name=oslr159>{{cite map | title = Map of Reading, Wokingham & Pangbourne | publisher = [[Ordnance Survey]] | isbn = 9780319237304 | date = 12 May 2011 | scale = 1:25000}}</ref>

Historically, the town of Reading was smaller than the borough. Definitions include the old [[ecclesiastical parish]]es of the churches of [[Reading Minster|St Mary]], [[St Laurence's Church, Reading|St Laurence]] and [[St Giles' Church, Reading|St Giles]], or the even smaller pre-19th century borough.{{sfn|Dils|1998}} Today, as well as the town centre Reading comprises a number of [[suburb]]s and other districts, both within the borough itself and within the surrounding urban area. The names and location of these suburbs are in general usage but, except where some of the outer suburbs correspond to [[civil parish]]es, there are no formally defined boundaries. The Reading urban area (officially Reading/Wokingham) additionally includes [[Winnersh]], [[Wokingham]], [[Crowthorne]] and the civil parishes of [[Earley]], [[Woodley, Berkshire|Woodley]], [[Purley on Thames|Purley]], [[Tilehurst]] and [[Shinfield]].<ref name="ReadingUA">{{cite web|last=|first=|date=27 November 2020|title=United Kingdom's largest town by population.|url=https://www.getreading.co.uk/news/reading-berkshire-news/reading-city-status-royal-charter-19327991|access-date=1 February 2021|website=Get Reading|archive-date=28 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210128154810/https://www.getreading.co.uk/news/reading-berkshire-news/reading-city-status-royal-charter-19327991|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Climate===
Like the rest of the United Kingdom, Reading has a [[maritime climate]], with limited seasonal temperature ranges and generally moderate rainfall throughout the year. The nearest official [[Met Office]] weather station is located at the [[Reading University]] Atmospheric Observatory on the [[Whiteknights Park|Whiteknights Campus]], which has recorded atmospheric measurements and meteorological observations since 1970.<ref>{{cite web|title=Reading University Atmospheric Observatory|url=http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/Data/fieldsite/docs/|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120914075939/http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/Data/fieldsite/docs/|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 September 2012|publisher=[[University of Reading]]|access-date=18 June 2011}}</ref> The local absolute maximum temperature of {{convert|37.6|C|F}} was recorded on 19 July 2022 and the local absolute minimum temperature of {{convert|-14.5|C|F}} was recorded in January 1982.

Reading's location in the [[Thames Valley]] to the west of London has made the town a significant element in the nation's transport system.

===River===
The town grew up as a river port at the confluence of the [[River Thames]] and the [[River Kennet]]. Both of these rivers are navigable, and [[Caversham Lock]], [[Blake's Lock]], [[County Lock]], [[Fobney Lock]] and [[Southcote Lock]] are all within the borough. Today, navigation is predominantly for purposes of leisure: private and hire boats dominate traffic, while scheduled boat services operate on the Thames from [[wharves]] on the Reading side of the river near [[Caversham Bridge]].<ref name="salters">{{cite web | publisher = Salters Steamers |url=http://www.salterssteamers.co.uk/readhen.htm | title = Reading to Henley Service |access-date=30 April 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070802161401/http://www.salterssteamers.co.uk/readhen.htm | archive-date=2 August 2007 }}</ref><ref name="boatserv">{{cite web |publisher=Thames River Cruises | url = http://www.thamesrivercruise.co.uk/scheduled_trip2.asp |title=Boat service from Reading to Mapledurham | access-date = 29 April 2007 | url-status = dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070430174450/http://www.thamesrivercruise.co.uk/scheduled_trip2.asp | archive-date=30 April 2007 }}</ref>

===Road===
Reading was a major staging point on the [[A4 road (England)|old Bath Road (A4)]] from London to [[Avonmouth]] near Bristol. This road still carries local traffic, but has now been replaced for long-distance traffic by the [[M4 motorway]], which closely skirts the borough and serves it with three junctions, J10-J12. Other main roads serving Reading include the [[A33 road|A33]], A327, [[A329 road|A329]], [[A4074 road|A4074]] and A4155. Within Reading there is the [[Inner Distribution Road]] (IDR), a ring road for local traffic. The IDR is linked with the M4 by the A33 [[Bypass (road)|relief road]]. The [[Thames]] is crossed by both [[Reading Bridge|Reading]] and [[Caversham Bridge|Caversham]] road bridges, while several road bridges cross the Kennet, the oldest surviving one of which is [[High Bridge, Reading|High Bridge]].<ref>{{cite web|title=11 High Bridge|url=http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/radstock/rht/trail/trail11.html|work=Reading History Trail|access-date=9 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514074400/http://atschool.eduweb.co.uk/radstock/rht/trail/trail11.html <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archive-date=14 May 2011}}</ref>

Reading has two operational [[park and ride]] sites. Mereoak, a short distance south of Junction 11 of the M4, is also a stop for [[National Express Coaches]] between London and the West.<ref>{{cite web|title=Destinations|url=http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach/destinations/destinationdetails.cfm?t=own&location_code=61206&fromc=Reading%20-%20Calcot|publisher=National Express|access-date=13 June 2011|archive-date=15 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615134850/http://www.nationalexpress.com/coach/destinations/destinationdetails.cfm?t=own&location_code=61206&fromc=Reading%20-%20Calcot|url-status=live}}</ref> A site outside the [[Winnersh Triangle railway station]] opened in 2015 and is easily accessed from the junction where the A329(M) becomes the A3290.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-34626113 |title=New park and ride for Reading in operation |date=26 October 2015 |access-date=2 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211102103003/https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-berkshire-34626113 |archive-date=2 November 2021 |url-status=live |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

===Rail===
Reading is a major junction point of the [[National Rail]] system, and hence [[Reading railway station|Reading station]] is a transfer point and terminus. In a project that finished in 2015, Reading station was redeveloped at a cost of £850m, with [[grade separation]] of some conflicting traffic flows, and extra platforms, to relieve severe congestion at this station.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/6339.aspx | title = Reading station area redevelopment | publisher = [[Network Rail]] | access-date = 13 June 2011 | archive-date = 28 December 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20161228050820/http://www.networkrail.co.uk/aspx/6339.aspx | url-status = live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Reading rail station's £850m upgrade to finish early|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-13437508|work=[[BBC News]]|location=London|access-date=13 June 2011|date=18 May 2011|archive-date=21 May 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521095943/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-13437508|url-status=live}}</ref> Railway lines link Reading to both [[Paddington railway station|Paddington]] and [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo]] stations in London.

Reading is a western terminus of the [[Elizabeth line]], which provides stopping services to London Paddington, and means Reading is featured on the London [[Tube map]]. Cross-London connections are possible from Reading to [[Abbey Wood railway station|Abbey Wood]] and [[Shenfield railway station|Shenfield]] in the east.<ref>[https://www.crossrail.co.uk/project/our-plan-to-complete-the-elizabeth-line/phased-opening#:~:text=2023%20%2D%20Final%20version%20of%20the,trains%20per%20hour%20off%2Dpeak Phased Opening] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220928021557/https://www.crossrail.co.uk/project/our-plan-to-complete-the-elizabeth-line/phased-opening#:~:text=2023%20%2D%20Final%20version%20of%20the,trains%20per%20hour%20off%2Dpeak |date=28 September 2022 }} Crossrail</ref>

[[Gatwick Airport]] can be accessed accessed via a direct local train operating via Guildford, and [[Luton Airport|Luton]] and [[London Stansted Airport|Stansted]] airports can be accessed with one change in Central London. Further afield, [[Southampton Airport]] can be accessed directly by rail in around 50-70 minutes depending on the service, or reached by road in approximately the same timeframe.

===Public transport===
Today local public transport is largely by road, which is often affected by peak hour congestion in the borough. A frequent local bus network within the borough, and a less frequent network in the surrounding area, are provided by [[Reading Buses]] - one of the few remaining [[Municipal bus company|municipal bus companies]] in the country - and its subsidiaries Newbury & District and [[Thames Valley Buses]]. Other bus operators serving Reading include [[Carousel Buses]], [[Thames Travel]] and RedRose.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.reading-travelinfo.co.uk/bus.aspx | title = travel Reading - Travel By Bus | publisher = [[Reading Borough Council]] | access-date = 20 February 2016 | archive-date = 4 February 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160204141036/http://www.reading-travelinfo.co.uk/bus.aspx | url-status = live }}</ref> [[ReadiBus]] provides an on-demand transport service for people with restricted mobility in the area.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.readibus.co.uk/ | title = ReadiBus The Dial-a-Ride, door-to-door assisted bus service | publisher = [[ReadiBus]] | access-date = 20 February 2016 | archive-date = 3 March 2016 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160303165223/http://www.readibus.co.uk/ | url-status = live }}</ref>


===Bike sharing===
In March 2011, Reading Borough Council approved a bike sharing scheme similar to [[London Cycle Hire Scheme]], with 1,000 bicycles available at up to 150 docking stations across Reading. However this scheme came to an end in March 2019, with the operator unable to cover the operational costs or find a sponsor to do so.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bike Hire Plans for Reading|url=http://www.reading.gov.uk/pressreleases/2011/mar/bike-hire-plans-for-reading/|publisher=Reading Borough Council|access-date=5 April 2012|date=10 March 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904162407/http://www.reading.gov.uk/pressreleases/2011/mar/bike-hire-plans-for-reading/|archive-date=4 September 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Fort|first=Linda|title=Green light for Reading bike hire scheme|url=http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2089319_green_light_for_reading_bike_hire_scheme|work=[[Reading Post]]|publisher=Surrey & Berkshire Media|access-date=25 June 2011|date=15 March 2011|archive-date=11 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110911200746/http://www.getreading.co.uk/news/s/2089319_green_light_for_reading_bike_hire_scheme|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.reading.co.uk/readybike-cycle-hire-reading/ |title=ReadyBike Cycle Hire Comes To An End In Reading |work=Reading.co.uk |date=18 March 2019 |access-date=13 September 2021 |archive-date=13 September 2021 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210913111425/https://www.reading.co.uk/readybike-cycle-hire-reading/}}</ref>
