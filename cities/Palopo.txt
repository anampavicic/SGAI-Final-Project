'''Palopo''' or '''Kota Palopo''' is a city located in [[South Sulawesi]], [[Indonesia]], and the second-largest city in the province. Until it acquired its autonomy on 10 April 2002, Palopo was the capital of [[Luwu Regency]]. The area of the city is 247.52&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and it had a population of 148,033 at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 184,681 at the 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> comprising 92,444 males and 92,237 females. The official estimate as at mid 2022 was 190,867 (comprising 95,562 males and 95,305 females),<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2023">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2023, ''Kota Palopo Dalam Angka 2023'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.7373)</ref> but the mid-2023 official estimate showed a sizeable reduction to 177,526 (comprising 88,693 males and 88,833 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Palopo Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.7373)</ref>

== History ==
[[File:Masjid Tua Palopo.JPG|thumb|left|17th-century [[Palopo Old Mosque]] is one of the oldest mosques in Indonesia.]]
Palopo was founded c. 1620, probably under the second Muslim ruler of [[Luwu]] Kingdom, Sultan Abdullah Muhiddin, who is buried at Malangke, the former palace centre of Luwu. His momental grave, which was carved with [[Majapahit]]-style floral decorations, was destroyed by Kahar Muzakkar rebels in the 1950s: nothing today remains except the location.<ref>Van Lijf, J.M. 1953. 'Korte mededelingen.' ''Bijdragen tot de Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' 109:379-81.</ref> The advantage of Palopo over the former palace centre was the potential for trade with the [[Toraja]]-speaking Seko-Rongkong valleys. The town sits at the foot of a steep, winding pass which leads into the highland regions. In the late 19th century this trade consisted primarily of coffee and slaves.<ref>Braam Morris, D.F. van. 1889. 'Het landschap Loewoe.' ''Tijdschrift voor Indische Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde'' 32: 497-555; Zerner, C. 1981. 'Signs of the spirits, signature of the smith: Iron forging in Tana Toraja.' ''Indonesia'' 31: 89-112</ref> Gold panned from upland rivers may also have been an attraction. [[Dammar]] was an important export in the later period.<ref>Caldwell, I. 1994. â€˜Report on fieldwork.' ''Baruga'' 10:16-18.</ref>

Little is known of Palopo before the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch annexation]] of South Sulawesi in 1905. The only Western visitor to have left an account of the town was [[James Brooke]] (later [[Raja]]h of [[Sarawak]]), who described it in the 1830s as 'a miserable town, consisting of about 300 houses, scattered and dilapidated'.<ref>Brooke, J. 1848. ''Narrative of events in Borneo and Celebes down to the occupation of Labuan. From the Journals of James Brooke, Esq. Rajah of Sarawak and Governor of Labuan [. . .] by Captain [[Rodney Mundy]].'' London: John Murray</ref> It is the location of the [[Palopo Old Mosque]], South Sulawesi's oldest mosque. Built from blocks of white coral, with a three-tiered roof representing the ancient [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] cosmos, the Mesjid Jami' is said to have been built during the reign of Sultan Abdullah. It has a 19th-century dedicatory inscription behind one of its doors, presumably reflecting a restoration. The royal graveyard lies to the north at Lokkoe and contains pyramidical stone mausolea in which lie the remains of Luwu's 17th to 20th-century rulers.

== Administrative districts ==
Palopo City is divided into nine [[Districts of Indonesia|Districts]] (''Kecamatan''), tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and the 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Palopo Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.7373)</ref> The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, the number of urban [[administrative village|villages]] (''kelurahan'') in each district, and its post code.
