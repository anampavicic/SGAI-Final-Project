It is the [[Federative units of Brazil#List|largest Brazilian state by area]] and the [[list of the largest country subdivisions by area|ninth-largest country subdivision in the world]]. It is the largest country subdivision in [[South America]], being greater than the areas of [[Chile]], [[Paraguay]], and [[Uruguay]] combined.  Neighbouring states are (from the north clockwise) [[Roraima]], [[Pará]], [[Mato Grosso]], [[Rondônia]], and [[Acre (state)|Acre]]. It also borders the nations of [[Peru]], [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]. This includes the [[departments of Colombia|Departments]] of [[Amazonas (Colombian department)|Amazonas]], [[Vaupés Department|Vaupés]] and [[Guainía Department|Guainía]] in Colombia, as well as the [[Amazonas State, Venezuela|Amazonas state]] in Venezuela, and the [[Loreto Region]] in Peru.

Amazonas is named after the [[Amazon River]], and was formerly part of the [[Spanish Empire]]'s [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], a region called [[Spanish Guyana]]. It was settled by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] moving northwest from [[Brazil]] in the early 18th century and incorporated into the [[Portuguese empire]] after the [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)|Treaty of Madrid]] in 1750. It became a state under the [[First Brazilian Republic]] in 1889.

Most of the state is [[tropical rainforest|tropical jungle]]; cities are clustered along navigable waterways and are accessible only by boat or plane. The capital and largest city is [[Manaus]], a modern city of 2.1 million inhabitants in the middle of the jungle on the Amazon River, 1,500&nbsp;km upstream from the [[Atlantic Ocean]].  Nearly half the state's population lives in the city; the other large cities, [[Parintins]], [[Manacapuru]], [[Itacoatiara, Amazonas|Itacoatiara]], [[Tefé]], and [[Coari]] are also along the Amazon River in the eastern half of the state.

==Etymology==
The name was originally given to the [[Amazon River]] that runs through the state by the Spaniard [[Francisco de Orellana]] in 1541.  Claiming to have come across a warlike tribe of Natives, with whom he fought, he likened them to the Amazons of [[Greek mythology]], giving them the same name of ''Río de las Amazonas''.

===Rise of the rainforest===
{{See also|History of South America#Amazon|Amazon rainforest#History}}

At one time the Amazon River flowed westward, perhaps as part of a proto-Congo (Zaïre) river system from the interior of present-day Africa when the continents were joined as part of western [[Gondwana]]. Fifteen million years ago, the Andes were formed by the collision of the [[South American Plate]] with the [[Nazca Plate]] (eastern Pacific oceanic) plate. The rise of the Andes and the linkage of the Brazilian and Guyana bedrock shields, blocked the river and caused the Amazon to become a vast inland sea. Gradually this inland sea became a massive swampy, freshwater lake and the marine inhabitants adapted to life in freshwater. For example, over 20 species of stingray, most closely related to those found in the Pacific Ocean, can be found today in the fresh waters of the Amazon.

About ten million years ago, waters worked through the [[sandstone]] to the west and the Amazon began to flow eastward. At this time the Amazon rainforest was born. During the Ice Age, sea levels dropped and the great Amazon lake rapidly drained and became a river. Three million years later, the ocean level receded enough to expose the Central American [[isthmus]] and allow mass migration of mammal species between the Americas.

The Ice Ages caused tropical rainforest around the world to retreat. Although debated, it is believed that much of the Amazon reverted to [[savanna]] and [[montane forest]]. Savanna divided patches of rainforest into "islands" and separated existing species for periods long enough to allow genetic differentiation. A similar rainforest retreat took place in Africa, where Delta core samples suggest that even the mighty Congo watershed was void of rainforest at this time. When the ice ages ended, the forest was again joined, and the species that were once one, had diverged significantly enough to be designated as separate species, adding to the tremendous diversity of the region. About 6,000 years ago, sea levels rose about 130 meters, once again causing the river to be inundated like a long, giant freshwater lake.

===Native peoples===
{{main article|Indigenous peoples in Brazil}}
The [[pre-Columbian]] Amazonas was inhabited by seminomadic peoples whose livelihood mixed occasional agriculture with a fishing and [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle.  Because of Christopher Columbus' misunderstanding of the continent at which he had arrived, the native population were and are denominated "índios" by the Portuguese.  Approximately two thousand Indian tribes lived in the region in the sixteenth century, perhaps amounting to some millions of people, but phenomena such as disease and assimilation to Brazilian culture caused their numbers to fall to approximately three hundred thousand, and two hundred tribes, by the end of the twentieth century.  Certain [[uncontacted tribes]] still exist in the region.

===Colonial conflicts===
In the colonial time, the territory which today belongs to the State of Amazonas, was a combination of treaties, expeditions, evangelism and military occupations. Scarce but recorded claims and indigenous uprisings in the region, were initially made by the [[Spanish Empire]] through the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] and after the [[Portuguese Empire]] by the [[First Treaty of San Ildefonso]]. The State also includes territory from failed attempts at colonization by the European powers, such as [[England]] and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] empire.

[[File:1562 Diego Gutierrez Amazonas.jpg|thumb|right|1562 map of the Amazon River Region.]]
The first Spanish expedition was by [[Francisco de Orellana]] in conjunction with Catholic priest [[Gaspar de Carvajal]], who documented the expedition. He reported a conflict against indigenous women which led to the current name of the river, and then to the current name of the region and the state (Amazonas in English: [[Amazons]]). The second Spanish expedition was by [[Pedro de Ursúa]], intending to prove the previous expedition, but resulted in the [[Spanish Kingdom]] dropping the attempt to colonize the region.

After the unification of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] kingdoms, [[Portugal]] launched an expedition on the river [but in reverse from Francisco de Orellana, at the mouth of the river to the site of the present-day city of [[Quito]], capital of [[Ecuador]]], with the intention of attaching [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] lands (comprising the current territory of the [[Brazilian Amazon]]) to the [[Portuguese Kingdom]]. After the dissolution of the [[Iberian Union]], [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] possessions in the region were undefined, resulting in internal conflicts in the region between [[Portugal]] and [[Spain]]. The [[Portuguese Crown]] later asserted the principle of [[uti possidetis]], with respect to the region. This was the first assertion of the principle from Roman law of ''uti possidetis, ita possideatis'', (Latin, "who has possession, has dominion"), analogous to English common law ''"Squatters rights"''. Due account may have been taken of John Locke's labour theory of property.

Conflicting issues arose between what was granted by law in the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (1494), and the subsequent reality of colonial expansion: the Spanish, eastward from the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] coastal plains (though restrained by the [[Andes]]), and the Portuguese, westward (aided by the waterways and lowlands of the mighty Amazon). The [[Treaty of Madrid (13 January 1750)]] – that determined the border between the Spanish possessions and southern Portuguese Brazil – had first enunciated the principle that new states, at the time of their creation shall have dominion over the lands that were settled as colonies. It implicitly opened the door to claims by prior possession in the vast lands of the north.

After the independence of [[Brazil]] in 1822, the current borders of the Amazonas State were still undefined – at that time being with [[Gran Colombia]]. The internal conflicts within that neighbour country resulted in the emergence of [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Panama]]. Brazil signed the [[Vásquez Cobo–Martins treaty|Treaty Vásquez Cobo–Martins (1908)]] (with those countries) finally entitling those possessions in the north to Brazil. One region is marked by the geodesic line Apóporis-Tabatinga; and the other is the municipal area of [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]], on the [[Brazil-Colombia border]].

===Spanish conquistadors and Jesuits===
[[File:Francisco de Orellana1.JPG|thumb|right|Bust of [[Francisco de Orellana]], explorer who visited the [[Amazon River]]]]
By the [[Treaty of Tordesillas]] (1494), the whole Amazon basin was in the area of the Spanish Crown. The mouth of a great river was explored by Spanish ''conquistador'' [[Vicente Yáñez Pinzón]], who reached it in February 1500, with his cousin [[Diego de Lepe]].  He called the river ''Río Santa María de la Mar Dulce'' (River of Saint Mary of the Sweet Sea) on account of the large freshwater estuary extending into the sea at its mouth.

In 1541, Spanish ''conquistadores'' [[Gonzalo Pizarro]] and [[Francisco de Orellana]], from [[Quito]], Ecuador, crossed the [[Andes Mountains]] and explored the course of the river to the Atlantic Ocean.  The indigenous people called this river the ''Conoris''.{{refn|The river the English language calls the Amazon has three names in Spanish and Portuguese: the Amazonas applies only from the estuary to the junction with the Rio Negro Thereafter the river becomes the Solimões until it enters Peru, where it is called the Maranon|group=Note }}  The myth of women warriors on the river has spread in the accounts and books, without any popular scope,<ref>{{Cite book| last = Cascudo | first = Luís da Câmara | title = Dicionário do Folclore Brasileiro: 10<sup>a</sup> ed. | publisher = Ediouro | year = 1998 | location = Rio de Janeiro | isbn = 85-00-80007-0}}</ref> still making those regions to receive names of warriors of Greek mythology, the Amazons — among them the largest river in the region that became known as the Amazon River. Early publications, as was the style of the day, called the river after its European explorer, the ''Orellana''.

Also in the 16th century, there were the expeditions of ''conquistadores'' [[Pedro de Ursúa]] and [[Lope de Aguirre]] in search of the legendary ''[[El Dorado]]'', the Lost City of Gold (1559–1561)
Spanish [[Jesuit]] missions were the first settlements upstream on the Amazon.  As many as 30 missions were founded in Amazon territory, seven in Brazil, between 1638 and 1727.{{refn|Including San Ignacio|group=Note}} The municipality of [[Silves, Amazonas|Silves]] on an island of Lake Saracá is one of the oldest in the Amazon, originating in a [[Mercedarian]] Indian mission founded in 1663. By the early 18th century, they were destroyed by the Portuguese, depopulated by smallpox, or their indigenous residents taken away as slaves by Portuguese Bandeirantes.  A few were taken over by Portuguese Carmelites.  The destruction of the missions was the end of Spanish claims in western Amazonia. Only one is a populated place today, San Pablo, now the municipality of [[São Paulo de Olivença]].

===English, Dutch and French outposts===
Starting about 1580, without effective occupation, English, Dutch, French (and even some Irish) searching for so-called ''[[Drogas do Sertão]]'' (spices of the backlands{{refn|including cacao, sarsaparilla, urucu(annalto), cloves, cinnamon, anil, seeds, puxuri, vanilla|group=Note}}) had established some outposts upstream of the mouth of the Amazon.

===Portuguese usurpation===
[[File:Barcelos Amazonas.jpg|thumb|[[Barcelos, Amazonas|Barcelos]] was first headquarters of the captaincy of São José do Rio Negro.]]
{{For|prior history of Amazonian Brazil|Pará#History}}
From at least the time of the Tordesillas Treaty in 1494{{refn|the treaty line passed north-south through the coastal border of Maranhão/Pará in the north to a little south of São Paulo in the south.|group=Note}} until the Treaty of Madrid in 1750, the region of the upper Amazon was part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru ([[Viceroyalty of New Granada]] after 1717).  Everything north of the Amazon (Solimões) and west of the [[Nhamundá River]] (Yamundá, in Spanish), an affluent of the left bank of the Amazon that forms the boundary of Amazonas with Pará, was known as Spanish Guyana.

Portuguese expansion westward and northward of the Torsedillas Line began from the frontier of the northernmost [[captaincy of Maranhão]] with the expulsion of the French from [[São Luís, Maranhão|São Luis]] in 1615, and the founding of [[Belém]] at the mouth of the Amazon in 1616.  Exploration and colonization thence followed the waterway upstream.

There are accounts of Portuguese [[Carmelite]] missionaries active in the Solimões area, upstream of the Rio Negro, as early as the 1620s, but permanent settlements weren't established for another 80 years, so the records are nebulous.
The first documented Portuguese foray into upper Amazonia was the expedition of Portuguese explorer and military officer [[Pedro Teixeira]], who followed the great river from the Atlantic Ocean to Quito, Ecuador with 70 soldiers and 1,200 Indians in forty-seven great canoes (1637–1639). He returned by the same route, arriving back in Belem in 1639. According to the Portuguese, Pedro Teixeira placed a possession marker at the upper [[Japurá River]] in 1639.  Soon after that the Portuguese ''bandeirante'' [[António Raposo Tavares]], whose ''bandeira'', leaving the [[captaincy of São Vicente]] travelling overland, reached the Andes, and following the Amazon River, returned to Belém, visiting a total of about {{Convert|12000|km|mi}}, between 1648 and 1651.

Tropical jungle is hostile and impenetrable as well as European settlements were exclusively along the waterways. Portuguese expansion generally was east to west, and from the main channel, the Solimões, north and south along the tributaries. The character of the settlements was of three kinds: defense and occupation (''fortes''), economic (''feitorias''), and evangelical (''missões''). The first permanent Portuguese settlements in the region were Itacoatiara 176&nbsp;km east of Manaus, founded in 1655 by Portuguese Jesuit Padre [[António Vieira]] as Mission of Aroaquis on the island of [[Aibi]] near the mouth of [[Lake Arauató]], followed by [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira|São Gabriel]], founded in 1668 as by Franciscan Friar Teodózio [or Teodósio] da Veiga and Captain [[Pedro da Costa Favela]] on the Rio Negro, near the mouth of the [[Rio Aruím]]. In 1761, a fort was built on the location, and the settlement became the town of [[São Gabriel da Cachoeira]]. The first missionary ''aldea'' of the Portuguese in the Negro was that known as Santo Elias dos Tarumas (originally aldeia of Nossa Senhora da Conceição, and later called Airão), dating from 1692.
the capital Manaus, was founded in 1669 as the Fort of São José do Rio Negro (later called Lugar da Barra do Rio Negro or "place on the shore of Rio Negro") on the confluence of the Rio Negro and Solimões Rivers.

The Royal Charter of 1693 divided Amazonia among the Jesuits, Carmelites, Capuchines and Franciscans: the Jesuits restricted their activities to the south bank of the Amazon upstream to the mouth of the Madeira; the north shore of the Amazon as far as the Trombetas fell to the Franciscans, to the mouth of the Rio Negro to the Mercedarians, and the Negro itself and the Solimoes to the Carmelites.
The Portuguese Carmelites got a later start than the Spanish Jesuits, but their impact was more durable. Between 1697 and 1757, they established eight missions on the Solimões and nine on the Rio Negro.{{refn|On the Solimões, they were Coari, Tefe, Manerua, Paraguari, Turucuatuba, São Paulo, and Sao Pedro; on the Rio Negro, they were Jau, Caragai, Aracari, Comaru, Mariua, Sao Caetano, Cabuquena, Baratua, and Dari|group=Note}}  In addition, there were a few Portuguese Jesuit missions in the Solimões. In 1731, Portuguese Jesuits received orders from the Governor Luiz de Vasconcellos Lobo to establish two ''aldeias'' above the mouth of the Rio Negro, one on the right bank of the Orellana [[Solimões]], between the eastern mouth of the [[Javari River|Javari]] and the Carmelite ''aldeia'' of São Pedro; the other at the western mouth of the great river Japurá.  This was the beginning of what came to be called the [[Jesuit–Carmelite War]].

Antidote to settlement was disease: fierce smallpox epidemics in 1661, 1695, 1724, and 1743/49 left the region nearly depopulated.  A Carmelite Friar had notable success with the method of [[variolation]] in 1729, but the technique was not propagated. The Jenner cowpox vaccine was not introduced in Brazil until 1808. Variolation was prohibited in 1840, and vaccination was mandated in 1854.  But epidemics got worse until finally petering out around the turn of the century.

Within the project of occupying the Amazon hinterland, was formed the royal [[captaincy of São José do Rio Negro]] subordinate to Para, in Mar. 1755, with headquarters in the village of Mariuá, (now Barcelos).

====The borders of Brazil====
The boundary between the Portuguese and Spanish domination of the Amazon was eventually fixed at the Rio Javari (river that rises on the border between Amazonas state, Brazil, and Loreto department, Peru) by the Treaty of Madrid in 1750.

By the mid-18th century, the effective boundary between the two empires, the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru and Portuguese Brazil, had shifted to the area of the confluence of the Rio Negro and Amazon Rivers, in upper Amazonia.
While the Treaty of Madrid in 1750 implicitly recognized the principle of ''uti possiditis'', it did not actually specify the northern borders of the country.  At that time, the border of contention between Spanish and Portuguese domains was in the upper Solimões, at the junction of the Rio Negro. In the upper Salomoes, Spanish missionary influence was being displaced, and the Viceroy was indifferent to colonization, but Portuguese settlements were not yet established.
Part of the northern boundary between Brazil and what was then British Guyana, was set by the Spanish Boundary-line Commission of Yturriaga and Solano (1757–1763).  After two indecisive wars between Portuguese and Spanish colonial forces 1761–1763 and 1776–1777, the border between the Spanish and Portuguese possessions, the Viceroyalty of Peru (and successor states) and Grão-Pará region of Brazil, was set between 1781 and 1791 by negotiation.

===Age of rebellion===
In 1821, Grão-Pará and Rio Negro provinces became the unified ''Grão-Pará''. The following year, Brazil proclaimed its independence and Grão-Pará became the Province of Pará of state of Brazil.

When Emperor Pedro I declared independence from Portugal, in 1822, he had to fight also the provinces of Grão-Pará and Maranhão. In 1823, a ship commanded by British officer [[John Pascoe Grenfell]] arrived at the [[port of Belém]], to combat rebels. Only in August 1824 did the new governor swear loyalty to the Brazilian Emperor.
The [[Province of Pará]], including the ''comarca'' of Rio Negro, the upper Amazon region, was incorporated into the Empire of Brazil in 1824.

A revolt in 1832 demanded the autonomy of the Amazonas region as a separate province of Pará. The rebellion was suppressed, but the Amazons were able to send a representative to the Imperial Court, Friar [[José dos Santos Inocentes]], who got up the creation of the District of the Upper Amazon. During [[Cabanagem]] in 1835–40, the Amazon remained loyal to the imperial government and not joined the revolt.

As a sort of reward for loyalty, the [[Amazonas Province (Brazil)|Province of Amazonas]] was officially created by Emperor [[Pedro II of Brazil|Pedro II]] in 1850.

=== Rubber and economic exploitation ===
[[File:Photo allemã Manaos 1904-05.jpg|thumb|right|Rubber market in the centre of Manaus in 1904.]]
[[File:Estado do Amazonas 1906.jpg|thumb|Bond of the State of the Amazonas, issued 16. July 1906]]
{{main article|Amazon rubber boom}}
From the mid-19th century, the territory began to receive migrants from the northeast seeking a better life. Attracted by the rubber boom, they settled in important Amazonian cities such as Manaus, Tabatinga, Parintins, Itacoatiara and Barcelos, the first capital of Amazonas.
The state had an era of splendor in the 1890s, at the peak of the rubber boom. However, the economic gains were largely the result of great human suffering: untold thousands of enslaved Amerindian seringueiros (rubber tappers) died through disease and overwork.
[[File:Praça 15 de novembro, Manaus (AM).tif|thumb|November 15 Square, Manaus, 1906.]]
Manaus, which already boasted as the capital administrative of the State, experienced a great population growth and the economic advancement, resulting mainly from exports of raw materials until then exclusively from Amazon Region.

Characterized by being the largest of the States of Brazil, with an area of {{Convert|1559159.148|km2|sqmi}}. Amazonas has most of its land occupied by forest reserves and water. The access to the region is mainly made by waterway or by plane. It is located in the North of Brazil,  bordering the States of Mato Grosso, Rondônia, and Acre to the South; Pará and Roraima, in the North East beyond the republics of [[Peru]] for 1,430 km along the Yavari river, [[Colombia]] for 1,644 km and [[Venezuela]] for 996 km to the Southwest and Northwest respectively. Most of its territory is in the time zone UTC−4 (with 4 hours less than Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Thirteen municipalities in the West of the State are in the time zone UTC−5; it is one of the States of Brazil that contains two time zones in its territory. Amazonas is split by the Amazon river, the largest river by volume of water in the world.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Interactions Between Biosphere, Atmosphere and Human Land Use in the Amazon Basin|last=Nagy|first=Laszlo|publisher=Springer|year=2016|pages=35}}</ref> In the state, the river has several tributaries: [[Negro River (Amazon)|Negro]], [[Madeira River|Madeira]], [[Purus River|Purus]], [[Japurá River|Japurá]], [[Juruá River|Juruá]], [[Içá River|Içá or Putumayo]] and many other confluent. Most rivers are navigable for large ships.
[[File:Amazonas Köppen.svg|thumb|left|250x250px|Köppen climate types of Amazonas]]

===Climate===

The average temperature varies very little by season, between {{convert|26|by|28|C|F}}, the rainfall varies from 50 to 250&nbsp;mm per month, averaging 2100&nbsp;mm per year.
Most of the state is in the tropical rainforest climate zone, a type of tropical climate in which there is no dry season—all months have mean precipitation values of at least 60&nbsp;mm. Its latitude is within five degrees of the equator—which is dominated by the Intertropical Convergence Zone. The equatorial climate is denoted Af in the Köppen climate classification.

=== Relief ===
The relief of the state is relatively low, since in the region, 85% does not surpass {{Convert|100|m|ft}} of altitude. The highest points of the state are the Pico da Neblina, with an approximate height of {{Convert|2994|m|ft}}, followed by [[Pico 31 de Março|Pico Phelps or Pico 31 of March]] of {{Convert|2973|m|ft}}, located in the border between Venezuela and Brazil, both mountains are in the municipality of [[Santa Isabel do Rio Negro]] and ironically, are the highest in Brazil.

Amazonas is almost entirely covered by the [[Amazon Rainforest]], 98% according to officials,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/11/international/americas/11amazon.html The New York Times article on 2005 drought in Amazonas]</ref> and it is divided into three types of habitat, viz:
* ''igapos'' – permanently [[flood]]ed land, roots of vegetation always submerged
* ''varzeas'' – higher than ''igapos'', land is only submerged when [[river]]s are at their highest during the wet season
* low [[plateau]] – higher still, never submerged
The Amazon represents over half of the planet's remaining [[rainforest]]s and comprises the largest and most species-rich tract of [[tropical rainforest]] in the [[world]]. Wet tropical forests are the most species-rich [[biome]], and tropical forests in the [[Americas]] are consistently more species-rich than the wet forests in [[Africa]] and [[Asia]].<ref name="Turner 2001">{{cite book |last=Turner |first=I.

[[File:Vista Parcial de Manaus.jpg|left|thumb|[[Manaus]] is the capital and largest city in the Amazonas State.]]
The state achieved a very great population growth in the early 20th century, due to the golden period of rubber, and after installation of the Industrial Pole of Manaus, in the 1960s.  The state still maintains population rates above the national average. In the 1950s the state had a population growth of 3.6% per year, while Brazil has maintained a growth of 3.2%. In the period between the years 1991 and 2000, Amazon grew by 2.7% per annum while the national average remained at 1.6%. For 2018, the estimate is 4,080,611 inhabitants.

The composition of Amazonian population by gender shows that for every 100 female residents of the state there are 96 men; this small imbalance between the sexes is because women have a life expectancy of eight years higher than that of men. However, the migration to the state is mostly male.

The capital, Manaus, is the largest city in the northern region, with about 2,145,444 inhabitants. 52% of the state's population lives in the city.

Amazonas is the second largest precinct in northern Brazil, with 2,428,098 voters,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tre-am.jus.br/eleicoes/eleitorado-do-amazonas | language = pt | title = Regional Electoral Court - Amazonas | access-date = 2018-09-10 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20180911081620/http://www.tre-am.jus.br/eleicoes/eleitorado-do-amazonas | archive-date = 2018-09-11 | url-status = dead }}</ref> according to the Superior Electoral Court.

Amazonas economy was once reliant almost entirely upon [[Natural rubber|rubber]]; today it has wide and varied industries, including the farming of [[cassava]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s, and other agricultural products.

Recently the Brazilian government is pursuing the development of industries whose main focus will be the exporting of consumer goods. Due to its geographical proximity to the markets in the northern hemisphere and Amazon countries, like Venezuela, they believe this move will have a great economic impact not only in the north region of [[Brazil]] but in the entire country.

Over the last decades, a system of federal investments and tax incentives have turned the surrounding region into a major industrial center (the [[Free Economic Zone of Manaus]]).  The mobile phone and game console companies [[Flextronics]], [[LG Electronics|LG]] and [[BenQ-Siemens|Sony]] run manufacturing plants in Manaus.  Other major electronics and motorcycle manufacturers such as [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Honda]] and [[Yamaha Motor Company|Yamaha]] have plants as well.
