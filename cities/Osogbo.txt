== Flooding ==
The citizens of Osogbo, Erin-Osun, and Ilobu, in particular, had no idea what lay in store for them when the heavens opened up for a rainstorm on Tuesday, 3 August 2021.

In contrast to earlier floods in the state, which were preceded by a warning from the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, the nearly 8-hour downpour struck like a robber in the night and left tales of grief, tears, and blood by morning.The state capital, Osogbo, was hardest hit, while the damage also spread to numerous other communities. Ibu-Amo, Oke-Arungbo, Oke-Ayepe, Powerline, Gbonmi, Oke-Baale, Obalende, Obate, Oke-Oniti Alekuwodo, and Oke Awesin in Erin-Osun are some of the most impacted localities as Osun River, Awesin stream, and Opopo stream overflow their bounds.<ref>{{Cite news |website=www.vanguardngr.com|access-date=2023-09-24|title=How flood ravaged communities in Osogbo, Erin-Osun |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2021/08/how-flood-ravaged-communities-in-osogbo-erin-osun/}}</ref>

== History ==

[[File:Short oral story of Osogbo in Yoruba language by a native speaker.webm|thumb|250px|Short oral story of Osogbo in Yoruba language by a native speaker]]

According to tradition, In Ipole Omu, seven rulers reigned before Olarooye in the following succession: Adefokanbale, Aikanya, Ogbogba, Saso, Luberin, Laege (also known as Adetuturinrin; father to both Lajomo and Larooye), Lajomo and Olarooye.

During the reign of Oba Olarooye at Ipole, life became very unbearable because of incessant dry seasons. The then Ipole people became much dejected, worried and uncomfortable over the losses involving their farms, domestic animals and human beings. The Oba Olarooye was worried and disheartened by the situation at Ipole Omu. He wanted emergency solutions to inevitable and uncountable losses. This was the time he ordered the chief hunter at Ipole-in the person of Timehin-and his co-hunters to go on expedition and look for greener pastures. Timehin and the other hunters courageously took up the challenge and moved out in search of a better place for settlement. This expedition discovered River Osun.

Yoruba tradition claims many people fleeing the [[Fulani|Fulani Invasion]] settled at Osogbo following the fall of old Oyo. As a result, Osogbo increased in population largely due to migration from other Yoruba towns.<ref>Tunde Agbola. Osogbo: Cities, Volume 9, Issue 4, November 1992.</ref>

For want of a more open place than a grove and a more central location, Olarooye and his people abandoned their settlement, including the already flourishing market and moved to Ode-Osogbo. At Ode-Osogbo, Olarooye built his new palace at the present-day Idi-Osun while Timehin built the Ogun shrine now known as Idi-Ogun.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Probst|first=Peter|title=Picturing the Past: Heritage, Photography and the Politics of Appearance in a Yoruba City|url=https://www.academia.edu/5260070|journal=F.

Since then, Osogbo has maintained its function as an economic center.
