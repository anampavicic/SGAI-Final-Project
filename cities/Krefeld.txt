It is located northwest of [[Düsseldorf]], its center lying just a few kilometers to the west of the river [[Rhine]]; the borough of [[Uerdingen]] is situated directly on the Rhine. Because of its economic past, Krefeld is often referred to as the "Velvet and Silk City". It is accessed by the [[autobahn]]s [[Bundesautobahn 57|A57]] ([[Cologne]]–[[Nijmegen]]) and [[Bundesautobahn 44|A44]] ([[Aachen]]–[[Düsseldorf]]–[[Dortmund]]–[[Kassel]]).

Krefeld's residents now speak ''{{lang|de|[[Standard German|Hochdeutsch]]}}'', or standard German, but the native dialect is a [[Low Franconian]] variety, sometimes locally called ''{{lang|de|Krefelder Platt}}'', ''{{lang|de|Krieewelsch Platt}}'', or sometimes simply ''{{lang|de|Platt}}''. The [[Uerdingen line]] [[isogloss]], separating general dialectical areas in Germany and neighboring Germanic-speaking countries, runs through and is named after Krefeld's Uerdingen district, originally an independent municipality.

==History==
===Early history===
Records first mention Krefeld in 1105 under the name of ''Krinvelde''.

In February 1598, Walburga, wife of [[Adolf van Nieuwenaar]], and last Countess of Limburg and Moers, gave the [[County of Moers]], which included Krefeld, to [[Maurice, Prince of Orange]]. After her death in 1600, [[John William, Duke of Jülich-Cleves-Berg|John William of Cleves]] took possession of these lands, but Maurice successfully defended his heritage in 1601. Krefeld and Moers would remain under the jurisdiction of the [[House of Orange]] and the [[Dutch Republic]] during the [[Dutch Golden Age]] (1588&ndash;1672).<ref name=peele>Ada Peele, [https://books.google.com/books?id=VAgUAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA36 Een uitzonderlijke erfgenaam: De verdeling van de nalatenschap van Koning-Stadhouder Willem III], Uitgeverij Verloren, 2013, Germany, pp. 36-39.</ref> Krefeld was one of few towns spared the horrors of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618–1648). The town of Uerdingen, incorporated into Krefeld in the 20th century, had been destroyed at the hands of troops from [[Hesse]] during the Thirty Years' War, and almost ceased to exist.

After the death of [[William III of England|William III of Orange]] in 1702, Krefeld passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]].<ref name=peele/> The [[Battle of Krefeld]] occurred nearby in 1758 during the [[Seven Years' War]]. Krefeld and Uerdingen were included within the Prussian [[Province of Jülich-Cleves-Berg]] in 1815 (after 1822 the [[Rhine Province]]).

In 1872 Krefeld became an [[independent city]] within Rhenish Prussia. In 1918 during the [[First World War]] the [[Belgian Army]] used it as a base during the [[occupation of the Rhineland]]. In 1929 Krefeld and Uerdingen merged to form '''Krefeld-Uerdingen'''; in 1940 the name was shortened to simply ''Krefeld''.

=== The Mennonites of Krefeld ===
From 1607 [[Mennonites]] arrived in Krefeld, as in nearby [[Gronau, North Rhine-Westphalia|Gronau]], from neighboring Roman Catholic territories where they were persecuted. In 1609 [[Herman op den Graeff]], originally from [[Kerken|Aldekerk]], moved with his family to Krefeld. There he became a lay preacher and chairman of the Mennonite religious community. In 1637, Op den Graeff was referred to as “the Mennonite lord Bishop” (der hiesigen Mennoniten Herrn Bischof) of Krefeld in the reformed community’s minutes book.<ref>Taufgesinnte und großes Kapital: die niederrheinisch-bergischen Mennoniten und der Aufstieg des Krefelder Seidengewerbes, Mitte des 17. Jahrhunderts-1815. Page 105. Von Peter Kriedte (2007)</ref> They sought refuge in the lands of the more tolerant [[House of Orange-Nassau]], at the time rulers of Krefeld; in 1657 their congregation was officially recognized and in 1693 they were allowed to build their own church, although hidden in a back yard (which still exists, reconstructed after World War II, with about 800 members). Also the [[Quakers|Quaker]] Evangelists received a sympathetic audience among the larger of the German-Mennonite congregations around Krefeld, Gronau, [[Emden]] and [[Altona, Hamburg]].<ref>C. Henry Smith, ''Smith's Story of the Mennonites'', p. 139 (1981, 5th ed. Faith and Life Press) {{ISBN|0-87303-060-5}}</ref> In 1683 a group of thirteen Mennonite families (twelve of them Mennonite-Quakers), the so called [[Original 13]], including three of the [[Op den Graeff family|Op den Graeff]] families left Krefeld to re-settle in [[Pennsylvania]] in order to enjoy religious freedom. They crossed the Atlantic on the ship ''Concord'',<ref>Germantown Historical Society: Founders of Germantown; Jones, Iris Carter: Krefeld Immigrants</ref> and founded the settlement of [[Germantown, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Germantown]] (now incorporated in [[Philadelphia]]), invited by [[William Penn]], and thus beginning the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] ethnic identity.<ref>C. Henry Smith, ''Smith's Story of the Mennonites'', p. 360</ref> The most important Mennonite family of Krefeld were the [[silk]] merchants and silk weaving industrialists [[Von der Leyen (family from Krefeld)|Von der Leyen]] who, by 1763, employed half of Krefeld's population of 6,082 in their factories. Their residence, built from 1791, is the current City Hall.

=== The Jews of Krefeld ===
Jews were listed as citizens of Krefeld from 1617. In 1764, a [[synagogue]] was erected, and by 1812, under French rule, the town included 196 Jewish families, with three Jewish-owned banks. Under [[Napoleon]], the town became the capital for the surrounding Jewish communities including over 5000 Jews, and by 1897 they comprised 1.8% of the population.<ref name="yadvashemDB">[http://db.yadvashem.org/names/map.html?bla=1&width=750&height=550&language=en&itemId=5430334&terminal=null Jews of Krefeld] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023080045/http://db.yadvashem.org/names/map.html?bla=1&width=750&height=550&language=en&itemId=5430334&terminal=null |date=23 October 2013 }} [[Yad Vashem]] website.

A Jewish school existed in the town, with more than 200 students around 1900.<ref name="yadvashemDB" />

In November 1938, during the [[Kristallnacht|November pogroms]], a synagogue on Marktstraße, as well as synagogues in [[Krefeld-Linn|Linn]], [[Uerdingen]] and [[Hüls (Krefeld)|Hüls]] were destroyed, in addition to attacks on Jewish shops and homes.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-22 |title=Teil 52: 9./10.

In 2008, a new synagogue, library and Jewish cultural center were erected on the location of one of the demolished synagogues. Around 1100 Jews were reported to live in and around Krefeld at the time.<ref>[http://www.dw.de/new-synagogue-opens-in-german-city-of-krefeld/a-3644442 New synagogue opens in Krefeld] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060841/http://www.dw.de/new-synagogue-opens-in-german-city-of-krefeld/a-3644442 |date=23 October 2013 }} (English, Deutsche Welle website)</ref>

===World War II===
{{further|Battle of the Ruhr}}
On 11 December 1941, during [[World War II]], a detailed report on the transport of Jews from Krefeld and its surroundings listed 1007 Jews from Krefeld and Duisburg, were deported to the Šķirotava Railway Station near [[Riga]], later to become [[Jungfernhof concentration camp]].

{{anchor|Allied air attacks}}On 21 June 1943, British bombs destroyed many buildings in the east part of the city; a firestorm consumed large parts of the city center (apart from the central train station, which remained intact apart from minor damage).

==Transport==
[[File:Autobahn A44 1.jpg|thumb|[[Bundesautobahn 44]] towards [[Mönchengladbach]]]]
Krefeld is connected to the [[Deutsche Bahn]] network with several stations, including its main station, [[Krefeld Hauptbahnhof]]. They are served by [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|Intercity]], [[Regional-Express]] and [[Regionalbahn]] trains. The [[Düsseldorf]]-based [[Rheinbahn]] operates a [[Stadtbahn]] service to the centrally located Rheinstraße stop. This line was the first electric [[inter-city rail]] line in Europe, established in 1898, and commonly called the [[K-Bahn]] because of the letter "K" used to denote the trains to Krefeld. Nowadays, in the [[Verkehrsverbund Rhein-Ruhr|VRR]] notation, it is called U76, with the morning and afternoon express trains numbered as U70, the line number there coloured red instead of the usual blue used for [[Rapid transit in Germany#U-Bahn|U-Bahn]] lines. The term ''K-Bahn'', however, prevails in common usage.

The city of Krefeld itself operates [[Trams in Krefeld|four tramway]] and several [[bus]] lines under the umbrella of [[SWK MOBIL]], a city-owned company. Since 2010, 19 of the oldest trams of the type [[Duewag]] GT8 were replaced by modern barrier-free trams of the type [[Bombardier Flexity Outlook]]. SWK Mobil owns an option to buy another 19 trams of the same type to replace the last 19 Duewag M8 trams. The whole tram fleet will then be barrier-free. Next to that the city plans to extend the line 044 in Krefeld-Hüls to connect the northern district of Hüls with the Krefeld downtown area.

== Economy ==
The headquarters of [[Fressnapf]], a pet food retailer franchise company, are situated in Krefeld.

The [[Nirosta]] steelworks, once owned by [[ThyssenKrupp]], was sold in 2012 to [[Outokumpu]].<ref name="on12">{{cite news |last1=Gerlach |first1=Marilyn |last2=Vassinen |first2=Eero |title=Outokumpu to buy Thyssen stainless steel unit in $3.5 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thyssenkrupp-idUSTRE80U0FE20120131 |publisher=Reuters |date=31 January 2012 |access-date=7 June 2021 |archive-date=23 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230923141234/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-thyssenkrupp-idUSTRE80U0FE20120131 |url-status=live }}</ref>
