It is the [[List of Nigerian cities by population|third-largest city by population]] in [[Nigeria]] after [[Lagos]] and [[Kano (city)|Kano]], with a total population of 2,649,000 as of 2021, and over 3 million people within its [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] area. It is one of the country's largest cities by [[Geographic coordinate system|geographical area]]. At the time of Nigeria's independence in 1960, Ibadan was the largest and most populous city in the country, and the second-most populous in [[Africa]] behind [[Cairo]].

Ibadan is located in south-western Nigeria, {{convert|129|km|mi}} inland northeast of Lagos and {{convert|530|km|mi}} southwest of [[Abuja]], the federal capital. It is a prominent [[Public transport|transit]] point between the coastal region and areas in the hinterland of the country. Ibadan had been the administrative center of the old [[Western State (Nigeria)|Western Region]] since the early days of [[British Empire|British]] colonial rule, and parts of the city's ancient protective walls still stand to this day. The principal inhabitants of the city are the [[Yoruba people]], as well as various communities (notably Igbo, [[Hausa people|Hausa]], Edo, and [[Ibibio people|Ibibio]]) from other parts of the country.

== History ==
{{see also|Timeline of Ibadan}}
Ibadan, coined from the phrase "Eba-Odan",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Eba+Odan|title=Ibadan: How it was defined|website=Ibadan name}}</ref> which literally means 'by the edge of the meadow', came into existence in 1829, during a period of turmoil that characterized [[Yorubaland]] at the time.<ref>Toyin Falola, Ann Genova, Matthew M. Heaton, ''Historical Dictionary of Nigeria'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2018, p. 189</ref> It was in this period that many old Yoruba cities such as old Oyo (Oyo-ile), Ijaye and Owu disappeared, and newer ones such as [[Abeokuta]], new Oyo (Oyo Atiba) and Ibadan sprang up to replace them.<ref name="thecity" /> According to local historians, [[Lagelu]] founded the city, and was initially intended to be a war camp for warriors coming from Oyo, [[Ife]] and [[Ijebu Kingdom|Ijebu]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://litcaf.com/ibadan-history/|title=Ibadan History|date=2016-02-12|work=Litcaf|access-date=2017-06-04}}</ref> As a forest site containing several ranges of hills, varying in elevation from 160 to 275 meters, the location of the camp offered strategic defense opportunities. Moreover, its location at the fringe of the forest (from which the city got its name) promoted its emergence as a marketing center for traders and goods from both the forest and grassland areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

In 1852, the [[Church Missionary Society]] sent David and [[Anna Hinderer]] to found a mission. They decided to build the mission and a church in Ibadan when they arrived in 1853.<ref name=anna>Martin Lynn, 'Hinderer, Anna (1827–1870)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/48961, accessed 18 March 2017]</ref>

Ibadan thus had initially begun as a military state and remained so until the last decade of the 19th century. The city-state also succeeded in building a large empire from the 1860s to the 1890s which extended over much of northern and eastern Yorubaland. It was appropriately nicknamed ''idi-Ibon'' or "gun base", because of its unique military character.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ucl.ac.uk/dpu-projects/Global_Report/pdfs/Ibadan.pdf |title=Ibadan-FINAL_Anna2_XX.qxd |access-date=2019-02-17}}</ref>

In Ibadan, unlike other Yoruba cities with traditional kingship institutions, the warrior class became the rulers of the city as well as the most important economic group.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ibadan {{!}} Location, History, & Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ibadan |access-date=2022-08-30 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref>

Ibadan grew into an impressive and sprawling [[Urban area|urban]] canter, such that by the end of 1829, Ibadan dominated the Yoruba region militarily, [[politically]] and [[economically]].{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} The military [[sanctuary]] expanded even further when [[refugees]] began arriving in large numbers from northern Oyo following raids by [[Fula people|Fulani]] warriors.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}} After losing the northern portion of their region to the marauding [[Fulani]]s, many Oyo indigenes retreated deeper into the Ibadan environs. The [[Fulani]] Caliphate attempted to expand further into the southern region of modern-day Nigeria, but was decisively defeated by the [[armies of Ibadan]] in 1840, which eventually halted their progress. The colonial period reinforced the position of the city in the Yoruba urban network. After a small boom in rubber business (1901–1913), cocoa became the main produce of the region and attracted European and [[Levant]]ine firms, as well as southern and northern traders from Lagos, Ijebu-Ode and [[Kano State|Kano]] among others. The city became a major point of bulk trade.{{Citation needed|date=January 2022}} In 1893, the Ibadan area became a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Protectorate]] after a treaty signed by Fijabi, the Baale of Ibadan with the British acting Governor of [[Lagos Colony]], [[George Chardin Denton|George C. Denton]] on 15 August.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtAkDl3OrQgC&q=awolowo+1954&pg=PA236|title=Nigerian Chiefs: Traditional Power in Modern Politics, 1890s-1990s|author=Olufemi Vaughan|year=2006|publisher=University Rochester Press |isbn=9781580462495}}</ref>

Its central location and accessibility from the capital city of [[Lagos]] were major considerations in the choice of Ibadan as the headquarters of the Western Provinces (1939) which ranged from the northernmost areas of [[Oyo State]] to [[Ekeremor]], [[Bomadi]] and Patani, which were regions transferred from the old Delta province in the Old Western region and later Mid-west to the old Rivers state and later Bayelsa, in the redistricting of Nigeria carried out by the [[Yakubu Gowon]] administration shortly before the [[Nigerian Civil War]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Afe |first=Mayowa |date=2022-10-23 |title=Yakubu Gowon, 'Last Good Man Standing' At 88 |url=https://guardian.ng/opinion/yakubu-gowon-last-good-man-standing-at-88/ |access-date=2023-06-12 |website=[[The Guardian (Nigeria)|The Guardian]] }}</ref>

In 2024, Ibadan was the site of a [[Oyo State coup attempt|failed coup attempt]] by Yoruba [[Separatist movements of Nigeria|separatists]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://humanglemedia.com/the-curious-journey-of-woman-who-declared-yoruba-independence-from-nigeria/ | title =  The Curious Journey Of Woman Who Declared Yoruba Independence From Nigeria  | author = Ibrahim Adeyemi | work = HumAngle | date = 23 April 2024 | access-date = 29 September 2024 }}</ref>

== Geography ==
Ibadan is located in south-western Nigeria in the southeastern part of [[Oyo State]] at about {{convert|119|km|abbr=off}} northeast of [[Lagos]] and {{convert|120|km|abbr=off}} east of the Nigerian international border with the Republic of [[Benin]]. It lies completely within the tropical forest zone but close to the boundary between the forest and the derived savanna. The city ranges in elevation from 150 m in the valley area, to 275 m above [[sea level]] on the major north–south ridge which crosses the central part of the city. The city covers a total area of {{convert|3080|km2}}, the largest in Nigeria.

The city of Ibadan is naturally drained by five rivers with many tributaries: Ona River in the North and West; Ogbere River towards the East; [[Ogunpa River]] flowing through the city and Kudeti River in the Central part of the metropolis. [[Ogunpa River]], a third-order [[stream]] with a channel length of 12.76&nbsp;km and a catchment area of 54.92&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Lake Eleyele is located at the northwestern part of the city, while the [[Osun River]], [[Asejire Reservoir|Asejire Lake]] bounds the city to the east and the fifth rivers boundary Ibadan with other Oke-Oguns towns, witch call [[Ogun River|Odo-ogun]] Rivers across [[Lagos State]], [[Ogun State]], [[Osun State|Osun]] State, [[Iseyin|Iseyin Town]] and [[Eruwa]] Town boundary to Ibadan.

=== Climate ===
Ibadan has a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw''), with a lengthy [[wet season]] and relatively constant temperatures throughout the year. Ibadan's wet season runs from March through October, though August sees somewhat of a lull in precipitation. This lull divides the wet season into two different wet seasons. November to February forms the city's [[dry season]], during which Ibadan experiences the typical [[West Africa]]n [[harmattan]]. The mean total rainfall for Ibadan is approximately {{convert|1230|mm|in|0|disp=or}}, falling over about 123 days. There are two peaks for rainfall, June and September. The mean daily temperature is {{convert|26.46|C|F|2|disp=or}}, the mean minimum {{convert|21.42|C|F|2|disp=or}}, and the relative humidity 74.55%.

== Government Administration ==
There are 11 [[Local government areas of Nigeria|local governments]] in the Ibadan metropolitan area, consisting of five urban local governments in the city and six semi-urban local governments. Local governments at present are institutions created by the military government but recognised by the 1999 constitution, and they are the third tier of government in Nigeria. Local government councils consist of the Executive Arm made up of the Executive Chairman, the Vice Chairman, the Secretary and the Supervisory Councillors.<ref>{{cite web

=== Local Council Development Areas ===
The former Executive Governor of Oyo State, Senator [[Abiola Ajimobi|Isiaka Abiola Ajimobi]], created some Local Council Development Areas (LCDAs) out of some of the existing local government areas in Oyo State. From the Ibadan Urban Local Government areas, the following LCDAs were created. Out of Ibadan North Local Government area, Aare Latosa LCDA and Irepodun LCDA were created.
Out of Ibadan North East Local Government area, Ibadan East LCDA was created.
Out of Ibadan North West Local Government area, Oke'Badan North LCDA was created. Out of Ibadan South East Local Government area, Ibadan South LCDA was created. Out of Ibadan South West Local Government area, Ibadan West LCDA was created.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Oyo State Government – Official Website of Oyo State Government|url=https://oyostate.gov.ng/|access-date=2020-05-24}}</ref>

From the Ibadan Semi-urban Local Government areas, the following LCDAs were created. Out of Akinyele Local Government area, Akinyele South LCDA and Akinyele East LCDA were created.

== Demographics ==
Until 1970, Ibadan was the largest city in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] by surface area.<ref name="thecity">{{cite book|last=Lyold|first=P.C |display-authors=etal |title=The City of Ibadan|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1967|isbn=978-0-521-11217-8}}</ref> In 1952, it was estimated that the total area of the city was approximately 103.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup><ref>Areola, O. "The Spatial Growth of Ibadan City and its impact on the rural Hinterland" in M.O. Filani, F.O. Akintola and C.O. Ikporukpo edited Ibadan Region, Rex
Charles Publication, Ibadan, 1994 page 99.</ref> However, only 36.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> was built up. This meant that the remaining 67&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> were devoted to non-urban uses, such as farmlands, river floodplains, forest reserves and water bodies. These "non-urban land uses" disappeared in the 1960s: an aerial photograph in 1973 revealed that the urban landscape had completely spread over about 100&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The land area increased from 136&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in 1981 to 210–240&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in 1988-89 (Areola, 1994: 101). By 2000, it is estimated that Ibadan covered 400&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>Onibokun, P. and Faniran A., Urban research in Nigeria. IFRA and CASSAD, Ibadan, 1995</ref> The growth of the built-up area during the second half of the 20th century (from 40&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the 1950s to 250&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in the 1990s) shows clearly that there has been an underestimate of the total growth of the city. In the 1980s, the Ibadan-Lagos expressway generated the greatest [[urban sprawl]] (east and north of the city), followed by the Eleiyele expressway (west of the city). Since then, Ibadan city has spread further into the neighbouring local government areas of Akinyele and Egbeda in particular.
