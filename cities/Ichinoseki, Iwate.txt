==Demographics==
The agricultural makeup of the city outside the centre is mostly composed of farmers, leading to an influx of [[Chinese people|Chinese]] and [[Filipino people|Filipino]] immigrants due to marriage. As a result, Ichinoseki has a varied ethnic makeup, although the newcomers still remain a small minority.

Per Japanese census data,<ref>[https://www.citypopulation.de/php/japan-iwate.php Ichinoseki population statistics]</ref> the population of Ichinoseki peaked in the 1950s and has declined over the past 70 years. Ichinoseki has been recognized by Japan's Office for the Promotion of Regional Revitalization ([[Second Kishida Cabinet|Kishida Cabinet Secretariat]]), which promotes the development of new technologies to combat depopulation, for meeting a "high standard" of [[digital transformation]]/[[Remote work|telework]] infrastructure. Related projects have been awarded over ¥80M in government grants.<ref>[https://www.chisou.go.jp/sousei/about/mirai/pdf/chihou_tw_2.pdf#page=26 <nowiki>''</nowiki>地方創生テレワーク交付金の交付対象事業一覧（新規事業)<nowiki>''</nowiki>]. 内閣府地方創生推進室, 2021, p. 26</ref>

==History==
The area of present-day Ichinoseki was part of ancient [[Mutsu Province]], and has been settled since at least the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period. The area was inhabited by the [[Emishi]] people, and came under the control of the [[Imperial House of Japan|imperial dynasty]] during the early [[Heian period]]. During the [[Heian period]], it was controlled by the [[Abe clan]], followed by the [[Northern Fujiwara]] clan of [[Hiraizumi, Iwate|Hiraizumi]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], the area was dominated by various [[samurai]] clans before coming under the control of the [[Date clan]] during the [[Edo period]], who ruled [[Sendai Domain]] under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. A portion of the present city was part of [[Ichinoseki Domain]], a sub-domain of Sendai Domain.

The town of Ichinoseki was established within [[Nishiiwai District, Iwate]] on April 1, 1889 with the establishment of the modern municipality system. It was raised to city status on April 1, 1948 by the merger of the towns of Ichinoseki and Yamame with the villages of Mataki and Nakasato.

*January 1, 1955 -  Ichinoseki absorbed the villages of Genbi, Hagisho, Maikawa, and Yasakae 
*September 1, 1956 - Due to a boundary adjustment, the city absorbed parts of the town of [[Hiraizumi, Iwate|Hiraizumi]].
*May 1, 1964 - Due to a boundary adjustment, the city absorbed more of the town of [[Hiraizumi, Iwate|Hiraizumi]].
*September 20, 2005 - the towns of [[Daitō, Iwate|Daitō]], [[Higashiyama, Iwate|Higashiyama]] and [[Senmaya, Iwate|Senmaya]], the villages of [[Kawasaki, Iwate|Kawasaki]] and [[Murone, Iwate|Murone]] (all from [[Higashiiwai District, Iwate|Higashiiwai District]]), and the town of [[Hanaizumi, Iwate|Hanaizumi]] (from [[Nishiiwai District, Iwate|Nishiiwai District]]) were merged with the city of Ichinoseki, which approximately doubled the old city's population and nearly tripled its size.
*September 26, 2011 - the town of [[Fujisawa, Iwate|Fujisawa]] (also from [[Higashiiwai District, Iwate|Higashiiwai District]]) was merged into Ichinoseki. Higashiiwai District was dissolved as a result of this merger.

==Government==
Ichinoseki has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 25 members.<ref>[https://www.town.hiraizumi.iwate.jp/index.cfm/27,0,135,294,html Hiraizumi Town Council]</ref> Ichinoseki and the town of Hiraizumi collectively contribute five seats to the Iwate Prefectural legislature. In terms of national politics, the city is part of [[Iwate 3rd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Education==
Ichinoseki has 29 public elementary schools and 16 public junior high schools operated by the city government and one junior high school and eight public elementary schools operated by the Iwate Prefectural Board of Education. There is also one private high school and one private junior college. The Prefecture also operates one special education school for the handicapped.
