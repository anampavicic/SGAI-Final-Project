'''Serang''' ({{langx|id|Kota Serang}}, {{IPA|id|kota sɛraŋ}}, [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]]: {{sund|ᮞᮦᮛᮀ}}) is a city and the capital of [[Banten|Banten province]] and was formerly also the administrative center of [[Serang Regency]] in [[Indonesia]] (the Regency's capital is now at Ciruas). The city is located towards the north of Banten province, on the island of [[Java]]; the north part of the city (Kasemen District) contains the coast zone facing onto [[Banten Bay]], and includes the historical site of [[Old Banten]], after which the province is named. Before Banten province was formed in 2000, Serang city was part of [[West Java]] province.

Serang has a [[tropical rainforest climate]], with no [[dry season]] month.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=967370&refer=|title=Serang, Indonesia Travel Weather Averages (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase}}</ref> It faces the [[Java Sea]], which is home to the [[Pulau Seribu Regency|Thousand Islands]].

Serang had a population of 576,961 in the 2010 census,<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> making it the third most populous city in the province of Banten. The 2020 Census gave a total of 692,101;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 735,651.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 6 September 2024, ''Kota Serang Dalam Angka 2024'' (sum of returns in district Katalogs as referenced below)</ref> Serang is located approximately 15&nbsp;km from the border of [[Jabodetabek]] (the Jakarta Metropolitan Area), and is sometimes considered as amalgamated with [[Greater Jakarta]].

===Religion===
[[File:Seba Baduy Banten Kota Serang.jpg|thumb|left|Seba Baduy festival of the indigenous [[Baduy people]].]]
The majority of people in Serang and Banten Province embrace Islam, but other religions coexist peacefully. Serang is often known as "''[[kota santri]]''" or the "city of pious people", due to the history as a traditional center of Islamic learning.<ref name="Ti">[https://www.timesindonesia.co.id/read/news/145390/mencari-kota-santri Mencari Kota Santri]. ''Times Indonesia''. Retrieved April 2, 2021.</ref> The city hosts two of the major [[congregational mosque]]s in Banten province, [[Ats-Tsauroh Great Mosque of Serang]] and [[Al-Bantani Grand Mosque]], which hold the capacity of 2,500 and 10,000 worshippers respectively.<ref name="Du">[https://duniamasjid.islamic-center.or.id/787/masjid-agung-ats-tsauroh/ Masjid Agung Ats Tsauroh].

===Language===
Compared with the majority in Banten Province who speak the [[Sundanese language]], some local residents in Serang also speak the [[Javanese language]] with a dialect similar to the [[Cirebon]] dialect of Javanese. The reason for this is that many Javanese migrants arrived in early 1527 to build the [[Sultanate of Banten|Banten Sultanate]], and remained to form the base of today's population.

==Transportation==
The city is served by {{stnlnk|Serang}} station, operated by Indonesia's rail operator PT [[Kereta Api Indonesia]].

The [[Tangerang–Merak Toll Road]], part of the [[Trans-Java toll road]], passes through the city of Serang.

The road to the proposed [[Sunda Strait Bridge]] would start in Serang, pass through Merak in neighboring [[Cilegon]] city to cross over the Sunda Strait to Sumatra.

==Administrative districts==
Serang was formerly a part of Serang Regency. On 2 November 2007, the status of Serang was changed into a municipality (''kota madya''), independent of the Regency. Since that time, Serang City is a [[enclave and exclave|semi-enclave]] within Serang Regency, as the city borders the regency in the south, east, and west, while it borders with [[Java Sea]] in the north.

The City of Serang is divided into six [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''), tabulated below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011"/> and the 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021"/> together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 6 September 2024, ''Kota Serang Dalam Angka 2024'' (sum of returns in district Katalogs as referenced below)</ref> The table also includes the number of [[administrative village]]s (all classed as urban ''kelurahan'') in each district, and its postal codes.
