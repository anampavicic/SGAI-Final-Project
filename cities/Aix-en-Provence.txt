The population of Aix-en-Provence is approximately 145,000. Its inhabitants are called ''Aixois'' or, less commonly, ''Aquisextains''.

==History==

{{see also|Timeline of Aix-en-Provence}}
{{For|the ecclesiastical history|Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Aix}}
[[File:Aix (52402216).jpeg|thumb|Rue Espariat in November 2013]]

Aix (''Aquae Sextiae'') was founded in 123 BC by the [[Roman consul]] [[Gaius Sextius Calvinus|Sextius Calvinus]], who gave his name to its springs, following the destruction of the nearby [[Gauls|Gallic]] [[oppidum]] at [[Entremont (oppidum)|Entremont]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=447}}<ref>[http://www.aixenprovencetourism.com/aix-histoire.htm « Histoire d'Aix »] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104035151/http://www.aixenprovencetourism.com/aix-histoire.htm |date=4 November 2013 }}, site de l'office du tourisme d'Aix-en-Provence.</ref> In 102 BC its vicinity was the scene of the [[Battle of Aquae Sextiae]], where the Romans under [[Gaius Marius]] defeated the [[Ambrones]] and [[Teutones]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=447}} with mass suicides among the captured women, which passed into Roman legends of [[Magna Germania|Germanic]] heroism.<ref>cf [[Jerome]], letter cxxiii, [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf206.v.CXXIII.html To Ageruchia], 8, 409 A.D.</ref>

In the 4th century AD it became the metropolis of [[Narbonensis Secunda]]. It was occupied by the [[Visigoths]] in 477. In the succeeding century, the town was repeatedly plundered by the [[Franks]] and [[Lombards]], and was occupied by the [[Saracens]] in 731 and by [[Charles Martel]] in 737. Aix, which during the [[Middle Ages]] was the capital of [[Provence]], did not reach its zenith until after the 12th century, when, under the houses of [[House of Barcelona|Barcelona/Aragon]] and [[County of Anjou|Anjou]], it became an artistic centre and seat of learning.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=447}}

Aix passed to the crown of France with the rest of Provence in 1487, and in 1501 [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] established there the parliament of Provence, which existed until 1789. In the 17th and 18th centuries, the town was the seat of the Intendance of Provence.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=447}} Current archeological excavations in the Ville des Tours, a [[medieval]] [[faubourg|suburb]] of Aix, have unearthed the remains of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[amphitheatre]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.mairie-aixenprovence.fr/SEDS|title=La Seds|date=23 April 2009|website=Mairie d'Aix-en-Provence|language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221004161222/http://www.mairie-aixenprovence.fr/SEDS |archive-date= Oct 4, 2022 }}</ref> A deposit of fossil bones from the Upper Continental Miocene gave rise to a Christian dragon legend.<ref>{{cite web|first1=Alfred |last1=de Grazia |first2=Ami |last2=de Grazia |url=http://www.q-mag.org/the-dragon-at-the-bus-stop.html |title=The Dragon at the bus-stop |publisher=Q-mag.org |date= |accessdate=2021-11-19}}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
Aix-en-Provence is situated in the south of France, in a plain overlooking the [[Arc (Provence)|Arc]] river, about {{convert|1|mi|km|round=0.5|order=flip}} from the right bank of the river. The city slopes gently from north to south and the [[Montagne Sainte-Victoire]] can easily be seen to the east. Aix's position in the south of France gives it a warm climate, though more extreme than [[The weather in Marseille|Marseille]] due to the inland location. It has an average January temperature of {{convert|6|°C|F|0|abbr=on|lk=out}} and a July average of {{convert|24|°C|F|0|abbr=on|lk=out}}. It has an average of 300 days of sunshine and only 58 days of rain.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aixenprovencetourism.com/uk/aix-en-provence.htm |title=Tourist office; the climate of Aix |publisher=Aixenprovencetourism.com |access-date=15 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100210024749/http://www.aixenprovencetourism.com/uk/aix-en-provence.htm |archive-date=10 February 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> While it is partially protected from the [[Mistral (wind)|Mistral]], Aix still occasionally experiences the cooler and gusty conditions it brings.

Like most of the south of France, Aix-en-Provence has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] Csa).

The [[Cours Mirabeau]] is a wide thoroughfare, planted with double rows of [[Platanus|plane trees]], bordered by fine houses and decorated by fountains. It follows the line of the old city wall, and divides the town into two sections. The new town extends to the south and west; the old town, with its narrow, irregular streets, and its old mansions dating from the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, lies to the north. Situated on this avenue, which is lined on one side with banks and on the other with cafés, is the Deux Garçons, the most famous [[brasserie]] in Aix. Built in 1792, it was frequented by the likes of [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Émile Zola]] and [[Ernest Hemingway]].<ref>{{Cite book|first=Claude-Alain|last=Sarre|title=Les Deux Garçons.

The Cathedral of the Holy Saviour ([[Aix Cathedral]]) is situated to the north in the [[medieval]] part of Aix. Built on the site of a former [[forum (Roman)|Roman forum]] and an adjacent basilica, it contains a mixture of all styles from the 5th to the 17th century, including a richly decorated portal in the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic style]] with doors elaborately carved in [[walnut]]. The interior contains 16th-century tapestries, a 15th-century [[triptych]] depicting [[René I of Naples|King René]] and his wife on the side panels, as well as a [[Merovingian]] [[baptistery]], its [[Renaissance]] dome supported by original Roman columns. The archbishop's palace (Palais de l'Archêveché) and a [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] [[cloister]] adjoin the cathedral on its south side.<ref>Michelin Guide to Provence, {{ISBN|2-06-137503-0}}, pages 67–68.</ref> The [[Archbishopric]] of Aix is now shared with [[Arles]].

[[File:L'Eglise St-Jean de Malte - Place St Jean de Malte - Aix-en-Provence.jpg|thumb|Saint-Jean-de-Malte]]
Among its other public institutions, Aix also has the second most important [[Court of Appeal (France)|Appeal Court]] (Palais de Justice) outside of Paris, located near the site of the former Palace of the Counts (Palais des Comtes) of [[Provence]].

The [[Hôtel de Ville, Aix-en-Provence|Hôtel de Ville]] (town hall), a building in the classical style of the middle of the 17th century, looks onto a picturesque square (Place de l'Hôtel de Ville). It contains some fine woodwork and tapestries. At its side rises a handsome clock-tower, erected in 1510.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aixenprovencetourism.com/aix-vieilleville.htm |title=Tourist office: Old Aix |publisher=Aixenprovencetourism.com |access-date=15 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100217045112/http://www.aixenprovencetourism.com/aix-vieilleville.htm |archive-date=17 February 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Also on the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville is the former [[Corn exchange|Corn Exchange]] (1759–1761) (Halle de Grains). This ornately decorated 18th-century building was designed by the Vallon brothers. Nearby are the remarkable [[Hot spring|thermal springs]], containing lime and [[carbonic acid]], that first drew the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] to Aix and gave it the name ''Aquae Sextiae''. A [[spa]] was built in 1705 near the remains of the [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[Thermae|baths]] of [[Sextius Calvinus|Sextius]].<ref>[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 1911.</ref>

South of the Cours Mirabeau is the [[Quartier Mazarin]]. This residential district was constructed for the gentry of Aix by [[Archbishop of Aix-en-Provence|Archbishop]] [[Michele Mazzarino]] brother of [[Cardinal Mazarin|Cardinal Jules Mazarin]] in the last half of the 17th century and contains several notable [[Hôtel particulier|''hôtels particuliers'']]. The 13th-century [[church of Saint-Jean-de-Malte]] contains valuable pictures and a recently restored organ. Next to it is the Musée Granet, devoted to European painting and sculpture.

Aix is often referred to as the city of a thousand fountains.<ref>Laurence Labrouche, "Ariane Mnouchkine: un parcours théâtral: le terrassier, l'enfant et le voyageur", L'Harmattan (1999), {{ISBN|2-7384-8022-5}}, page 66, "la ville aux mille fontaines"</ref> Among the most notable are the 17th-century Fontaine des Quatre Dauphins (Fountain of the Four Dolphins) in the Quartier Mazarin, designed by Jean-Claude Rambot,<ref>{{Cite book |title=Provence |series=Michelin Green Guide |year=1999 |publisher=Michelin |isbn=0-320-03732-0}}, page 69. The fountain was built in 1667,</ref> and three of the fountains down the central Cours Mirabeau: at the top, a 19th-century fountain depicts the "good king" [[René I of Naples|René]] holding the [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat grapes]] that he introduced to [[Provence]] in the 15th century; halfway down is a natural hot water fountain (34&nbsp;°C), covered in moss, dating back to the Romans; and at the bottom, at la Rotonde, the hub of modern Aix, stands a monumental fountain from 1860 beneath three giant statues representing art, justice and agriculture. In the older part of Aix, there are also fountains of note in the Place d'Albertas and the Place des Trois-Ormeaux.

Aix is the birthplace of Post-Impressionist painter Paul Cézanne. A walking trail links sites including his childhood home, Jas de Bouffan, and his former studio, Atelier Cézanne. The white limestone mountain Sainte-Victoire overlooks the city and was a frequent subject of Cézanne's works.

==Education==
[[File:Aix-en-Provence Institut etudes politiques 20061227.jpg|thumb|The Institute of Political Studies (Sciences Po)]]
Aix has long been a university town: [[Louis II of Anjou]] granted a [[royal charter]] for a university in 1409. Today Aix-en-Provence remains an important educational centre, with many teaching and research institutes:

* [[Arts et Métiers ParisTech]], an engineering graduate school that settled a campus in the city in 1843. This teaching and research center (CER) let the students attend courses focused on industrial and mechanical engineering.
* [[Aix-Marseille University]], consisting of the faculty and former campuses of:
**[[University of Provence Aix-Marseille I]], specialising in the humanities.
**[[Université de la Méditerranée Aix-Marseille II]], specialising in economics.
**[[Université Paul Cézanne Aix-Marseille III]], specialising principally in law, economics, political science and administration.
* [[Institut d'études politiques d'Aix-en-Provence]] (IEP) is part of France's network of political studies universities, often referred to as "Sciences Po".
* [[ZEAT|Institut de l'Aménagement Régional]], an institute in the Université Paul Cézanne for town and country planning.
* The American College of the Mediterranean (ACM), an American-style degree-granting institution with programs in art, art history, business, communication, French language and culture, international relations, psychology and many others. ACM also includes a study abroad institute for undergraduates, [[IAU College]].

Aix also has several training collèges, lycées, and a college of art and design. It has also become a centre for many international study programmes. Several lycées offer [[Classe préparatoire aux grandes écoles|CPGE]].

==Culture==
[[File:Rattle BPH-Rittershaus1-Wikipedia.jpg|thumb|right|Sir Simon Rattle conducting ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' in 2006]]

===Music===
Aix holds two significant musical events each year. These are:

====Festival d'Aix-en-Provence====
An important opera festival, the ''[[Aix-en-Provence Festival|Festival international d'Art Lyrique]]'', founded in 1948, now ranks with those in [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuth]], [[Salzburg Festival|Salzburg]] and [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera|Glyndebourne]]. The director until 2018 was [[Bernard Foccroulle]], organist and director of [[la Monnaie]] in Brussels. The festival takes place in late June and July each year. The main venues in Aix itself are the outdoor Théâtre de l'Archévêché in the former garden of the archbishop's palace, the recently restored 18th-century Théâtre du Jeu de Paume, and the newly built [[Grand Théâtre de Provence]]; operas are also staged in the outdoor Théâtre du Grand Saint-Jean outside Aix. Linked to the festival is the Académie européenne de musique, a summer school for young musicians with master classes by celebrated artists. Over the four-year period from 2006 until 2009, [[Sir Simon Rattle]]'s version of Wagner's [[Ring Cycle]] with the [[Berlin Philharmonic]] was performed at the Aix festival. The current director of the festival is [[Pierre Audi]].

====Musique dans la Rue====
This takes place each year in June to coincide with the national '[[Fête de la Musique]].' There is a week of classical, jazz, and popular concerts held in different street venues and courtyards in the city. Some of these events are held in the Conservatoire [[Darius Milhaud]], named in honour of the French composer, a native of Aix.

===Dance===
The dance company ''Ballet Preljocaj'' of the French dancer and choreographer [[Angelin Preljocaj]] has been located in Aix since 1996. In 2007 it took up residence in the [[Pavillon Noir]], a centre for dance performance, designed in 1999 by the architect [[Rudy Ricciotti]]. The centre is one of nineteen of its kind in France, designated ''Centre chorégraphique national''.

===European Capital of Culture===

Aix-en-Provence was part of [[Marseille-Provence 2013]], the year-long cultural festival when the region served as the [[European Capital of Culture]]. Aix hosted several major cultural events including one half of the Grand Atelier du Midi gala exhibition and an episode of the Révélations pyrotechnical performance. The city also unveiled major new cultural infrastructure to coincide with Marseille-Provence 2013, including the Darius Milhaud Conservatory designed by [[Kengo Kuma]].

===Museums and libraries===

In June 2011, the first part of the collection of the ''Fondation Jean et Suzanne Planque'' opened at the Musée Granet, containing over 180 artworks. This legacy of the Swiss painter, dealer and art collector [[Jean Planque]], a personal friend of [[Pablo Picasso]], has been donated to the city for an initial period of 15 years. The collection contains over 300 works of art, including paintings and drawings by [[Degas]], [[Renoir]]. [[Gauguin]], [[Monet]], Cézanne, [[Van Gogh]], Picasso, [[Pierre Bonnard]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Fernand Léger]], Giacometti and [[Dubuffet]].

*Le Pavillon de Vendôme, a 17th-century mansion housing permanent and touring art exhibitions.
*The [[Fondation Vasarely]], a gallery dedicated to the works of the Hungarian-born French [[abstract art|abstract painter]] [[Victor Vasarely]].
*Le Camp des Milles
*[[Cézanne's studio|L'atelier Cézanne]], the former studio of Paul Cézanne, now a museum, located in the northern outskirts of Aix. It has been preserved as it was at the time of the painter's death and contains many of his personal items and props used in his paintings.

Prior to 1989 Aix had several libraries, for example in the Parc Jourdan and the Town Hall. In 1989, many of these were moved to the Méjanes, an old match factory.

In 1993, the "Cité du Livre" was opened around the library. This has media spaces for dance, cinema and music, and a training facility for librarians. Adjacent to the Cité du Livre are the Grand Théâtre de Provence and the Pavillon Noir (see above).

To the east of Aix rises [[Montagne Sainte-Victoire]] ({{convert|1,011|m|ft|abbr=off|disp=or}}), one of the landmarks of the Pays d'Aix. It is accessible from the centre of Aix by road or on foot, taking the wooded footpath of Escrachou Pevou to the [[plateau]] of Bibemus.<ref>

In the village of [[Le Tholonet]] on the precipitous southern side of Mont Sainte-Victoire, there is a [[windmill]] that he used, and beyond that a mountain hut, the ''refuge Cézanne'', where he liked to paint.

To the north, the mountain slopes gently down through woodland to the village of [[Vauvenargues, Bouches-du-Rhône|Vauvenargues]]. The [[Château of Vauvenargues]] overlooking the village was formerly occupied by the [[List of rulers of Provence|counts of Provence]] (including [[René of Anjou]]) and the Archbishops of Aix before it became the family home of the [[Luc de Clapiers, marquis de Vauvenargues|marquis de Vauvenargues]].<ref>[http://www.vauvenargues.org/index.php?P=91&action=afficher&type=art&menu=3 Mairie of Vauvenargues, History and heritage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200518195509/http://www.vauvenargues.org/index.php?P=91&action=afficher&type=art&menu=3 |date=18 May 2020 }} {{in lang|fr}}</ref> It was acquired by the Spanish artist [[Pablo Picasso]] in 1958, who was resident there from 1959 until 1962, when he moved to [[Mougins]].

[[File:Gare aix en provence tgv3.jpg|thumb|left|[[Aix-en-Provence TGV railway station]].]]
A set of ancient roads radiate out from Aix to the surrounding countryside, the Pays d'Aix. There are also a large number of modern [[Autoroutes of France|autoroute]]s connecting Aix to nearby towns. There are autoroutes northwards to Avignon and to the [[Luberon]]; southwards to [[Marseille]]; and eastwards to [[Aubagne]] and the Mediterranean coast of Provence; and to [[Nice]] and other towns on the [[French Riviera]]. Aix and Marseille are equidistant from the [[Marseille Provence Airport]] (MRS) at [[Marignane]] on the [[Étang de Berre]] which features domestic and international scheduled passenger service. There is another airport at Les Milles, which is mostly used by general aviation. There is a frequent bus shuttle service from the main bus station in Aix which also serves the [[Gare d'Aix-en-Provence TGV|nearby TGV station]] at l'Arbois, in the middle of the countryside about {{convert|10|mi|km|0|order=flip}} from Aix.

At Aix, the line from Paris branches to Marseille and Nice; it takes about 3 hours to get from Paris to Aix by TGV. Aix also has a railway station near the centre, [[Gare d'Aix-en-Provence]], with connections to Marseille, [[Pertuis]] and [[Briançon]] in the [[French Alps]]. A frequent and rapid shuttle bus service for commuters operates between the bus station in Aix and Marseille. There are many other long distance and local buses from the bus station. The city also offers a "city pass" available in 24, 48, and 72-hour packages for visiting tourists.<ref name="Aix-en-Provence Tourist Office">{{Cite news|url=http://www.aixenprovencetourism.com/en/plan-your-trip/tourist-pass/|title=Aix-en-Provence City Pass {{!}} Aix en Provence │ Office de Tourisme|work=Aix-en-Provence Tourist Office|access-date=2017-12-18|language=en-GB}}</ref> The "pass tourisitque" is offered at the Aix-en-Provence Tourist Office, the Atelier de Cézanne, and the official Aix tourism website.<ref name="Aix-en-Provence Tourist Office"/>

In the town itself, there is an inexpensive municipal bus service, including a dial-a-bus service ("proxibus"), a [[park-and-ride]] service and tiny electrified buses for those with mobility problems – these are six-seater vehicles that circulate at a speed of {{convert|10|mph|km/h|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mairie-aixenprovence.fr/IMG/aed/27.pdf |title=BILAN 2001/06: la ville á visage humain |date=27 February 2008 |access-date=15 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090320132246/http://www.mairie-aixenprovence.fr/IMG/aed/27.pdf |archive-date=20 March 2009 }}</ref> The central old town of Aix is for the most part pedestrianised. There are large underground and overground parking structures placed at regular intervals on the "boulevard exterieur", the predominantly [[one-way traffic|one-way]] [[ring road]] that encircles the old town.

As well as overland routes, two "rivers" flow through Aix, the Arc and the Torse, but neither of which can remotely be described as navigable.
