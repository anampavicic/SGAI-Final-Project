The '''Riau Islands''' ({{langx|id|Kepulauan Riau}}, [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: {{Script/Arabic|كڤولاوان رياو}}, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 廖內群島) is a [[provinces of Indonesia|province of Indonesia]]{{emdash}}not to be confused with neighbouring [[Riau Province]] from which the Riau Islands Province were separated in 2002. The capital of the province is [[Tanjung Pinang]], while the largest city is [[Batam]]. It shares a maritime border with [[Riau]] and [[Jambi]] to the west, [[Bangka Belitung Islands]] to the south, [[Singapore]] to the northeast, [[Malaysia]] and [[West Kalimantan]] to the east, and [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]] to the north. It comprises a total of 2,028 islands (1,798 having names) scattered between [[Sumatra]], [[Malay Peninsula]], and [[Borneo]] including the [[Riau Archipelago]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kepri.antaranews.com/berita/37908/jumlah-pulau-di-kepri-berubah|title = Jumlah Pulau di Kepri Berubah}}</ref> Situated on one of the world's busiest shipping lanes along the [[Malacca Strait]] and the [[Natuna Sea]] ([[South China Sea]]), the province shares water borders with neighboring countries such as [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], and [[Brunei]]. The Riau Islands also have relatively large potential mineral resources and energy, as well as marine resources.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Straits of Malacca: Gateway or Gauntlet?|last=Freeman|first=Donald B.|publisher=[[McGill-Queen's University Press]]|year=2003|isbn=0-7735-2515-7}}.

The Riau Islands separated from the province of [[Riau]] in September 2002, becoming [[Indonesia]]'s third-youngest province.

A [[free trade zone]] of the [[Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle]], the Riau Islands has experienced rapid industrialisation since the 1970s. The Riau Islands is one of the country's most prosperous provinces, having a [[GDP per capita]] of {{currency|amount=72571750|code=IDR}} ({{currency|amount=8300.82|code=USD}}) as of 2011, the fourth highest among all provinces in Indonesia after [[East Kalimantan]], [[Jakarta]] and [[Riau]].<ref>[https://www.bps.go.id/linkTableDinamis/view/id/957 <nowiki>"[Seri 2010] Produk Domestik Regional Bruto Per Kapita Atas Dasar Harga Berlaku Menurut Provinsi, 2010–2016 (Ribu Rupiah)"</nowiki>].

The population of the Riau Islands is heterogeneous and is highly diverse in ethnicity, culture, language and religion. The province is home to different ethnic groups such as the [[Malay Indonesians|Malays]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Tionghoa]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and others. Economic rise in the region has attracted many immigrants and workers from other parts of [[Indonesia]].<ref name="sijgoog">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ck13DAAAQBAJ|title=The SIJORI Cross-Border Region: Transnational Politics, Economics, and Culture|last1=Hutchinson|first1=Francis E.|last2=Chong|first2=Terence|date=14 June 2016|publisher=ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute|via=Google Books|isbn=9789814695589}}</ref> The area around Batam is also home to many expatriates from different countries.

== Etymology ==
There are several possible origins of the word ''riau.'' The first possible origins is that ''riau'' is derived from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] word ''rio'', which means river.<ref>[[Suwardi MS]] (1991). [[oclc:29530430|''Budaya Melayu dalam perjalanannya menuju masa depan'']]. [[Pekanbaru]]: Yayasan Penerbit MSI-Riau.</ref><ref name="Kondisisosbud-setneg">[http://www.indonesia.go.id/in/provinsi-riau/sosial-budaya/6022-kondisi-sosial-budaya-riau "Kondisi Sosial Budaya Provinsi Riau"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304175653/http://indonesia.go.id/in/provinsi-riau/sosial-budaya/6022-kondisi-sosial-budaya-riau|date=4 March 2018}}. Sekretariat Negara, diakses 17 Oktober 2013.</ref> After the fall of the [[Malacca Sultanate]] in the early 16th century, the remaining Malaccan nobles and subjects fled from [[Malacca]] to mainland Sumatra while being pursued by the Portuguese. The Portuguese is believed to have reached as far as the [[Siak River]].<ref>Schnitger, F. M., Fürer-Haimendorf, C. & Tichelman, G. L. (1939). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=dcYUAAAAIAAJ Forgotten kingdoms in Sumatra]''. Leiden: E. J. Brill.</ref>

The second version claims that ''riau'' comes from the word ''riahi'' which means sea water.  The word is allegedly derived from the figure of [[Sinbad]] al-Bahar in the book of the [[Thousand and One Nights|One Thousand and One Nights]].<ref name="Kondisisosbud-setneg" />

Another version is that ''riau'' is derived from the [[Malay language|Malay]] word ''riuh,'' which means crowded, frenzied working people. This word is believed used to reflect the nature of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]] in present-day [[Bintan Island|Bintan]]. The name is likely to have become famous since [[Raja Kecil]] moved the Malay kingdom center from Johor to Ulu Riau in 1719.<ref name="Kondisisosbud-setneg" /> This name was used as one of the four main sultanates that formed the kingdoms of Riau, Lingga, Johor and Pahang. However, as the consequences of the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] between the [[Netherlands]] and United Kingdom, the Johor-Pahang sultanates fell under British influence, while the Riau-Lingga sultanates fell under Dutch influence.<ref>Mills, L. A. (2003). ''British Malaya 1824–67'' (p. 86– 87). Selangor, Malaysia: Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. Call no.: RSEA 959.5 MIL.</ref><ref>Brown, I. (2009).

Riau has for centuries been the home of [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Orang Laut]] people (sea nomads). Later migrants came from southern China and [[Mainland Southeast Asia|Indochina]], today people from a large region of Asia has settled on the Islands. The Riau archipelago is located between the China-India maritime trading route, and was early in the 14th century, together with [[Temasek]] (Singapore). Chinese maritime records one of Riau archipelago's islands was inhabited by Malay pirates.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bjorngrotting.com/destinations/asia/indonesia-asia/history-of-bintan/|title=Riau:: History of Bintan – Bjorn Grotting Photography|access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref>

As many as three hundred ships were used to force Chinese ships returning from the Indian Ocean into pirate harbors and to attack those who resisted.

During the 12th to 13th century, the Riau archipelago was a part of the [[Srivijaya]] Empire. Sri Tri Buana, a member of the royal family of [[Palembang]], visited Riau in 1290. The Queen of Bintan met him, and he combined flotilla of 800 vessels sailed for Bintan where he later became a king. It is also said that it was he who gave name to Singapore. Upon landing on [[Temasek]], the old name of Singapore, he spotted an animal, which he thought was a lion, and renamed Temasek as [[Singapore|Singapura]] (Lion City). He also proclaimed himself as a king of Singapore.<ref name="History">{{Cite web|url=http://www.indonesia-tourism.com/riau-archipelago/history_bintan.html|title=History of Bintan Island|publisher=Indonesia Tourism: Government of Indonesia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104013746/http://indonesia-tourism.com/riau-archipelago/history_bintan.html|archive-date=4 November 2010|url-status=dead|access-date=14 June 2010}}</ref><ref name="Hawk2" />

After the fall of [[Malacca City|Malacca]] in 1511, the Riau islands became the centre of political power of the mighty Sultanate of Johor or Johor-Riau, based on Bintan Island, and were for long considered the centre of Malay culture.<ref>''The Riau Islands and economic cooperation in the Singapore Indonesian border zone'' Karen Peachey, Martin Perry, Carl Grundy-Warr, Clive H Schofield, University of Durham.

In the early 18th century, the descendants of the Sultan and the Regent of Johor were fighting for power. [[Buginese people|Bugis]] aristocrats from [[Sulawesi]] was asked to assist the Regent of Johor, and managed to achieve control of Riau due to the internal struggle between the members of the Johor Sultanate. The Bugis made Bintan a major trading center. Riau and Bintan also attracted British, Chinese, [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Arabs|Arab]] and Indian traders. The Dutch however started to look upon Riau and the Bugis as a dangerous rival to Dutch trade in the region, drawing away trade from their ports in Malacca and [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] (Jakarta). A Dutch fleet attacked Riau in 1784 but failed to hold the islands. Another attempt later the same year also failed before they managed to break the Bugis blockade of Malacca in June 1784.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.colonialvoyage.com/dutch-malacca-1641-1795-1818-1825/|title=Dutch Malacca 1641–1795, 1818–1825|last=Ramerini|first=Marco|date=17 February 2014|website=Colonial Voyage|access-date=24 May 2019}}</ref> The Bugis commander, Raja Haji was killed during battle and the Bugis units retreated, which opened the way for a Dutch counterattack on Riau.

This also led to the return of the Bugis and the rivalry between the Bugis and Malay. Peace between the two parties was finally reached in 1803. Around this time Sultan Mahmud gave [[Penyengat Island]] as a wedding gift to his bride, Raja Hamidah, [[Raja Ali Haji]]'s daughter. Penyengat became for a period a center of government, Islamic religion and the Malay culture.<ref name="Matheson 1989 153–172">{{Cite journal|last=Matheson|first=Virginia|year=1989|title=Pulau Penyengat : Nineteenth Century Islamic Centre of Riau|journal=Archipel|volume=37|issue=1|pages=153–172|doi=10.3406/arch.1989.2567}}</ref>

Based on the royal ''[[adat]]'' (customary observance), the consent of Engku Puteri was crucial as she was the holder of the ''Cogan'' ([[Regalia|Royal Regalia]]) of Johor-Riau, and the installation of a new sultan was only valid if it took place with the regalia.

Rivalry between the British and the Dutch intensified. The British had earlier gained [[Dutch Malacca|Malacca]] from the Dutch under the [[Treaty of The Hague (1795)|Treaty of The Hague]] in 1795 and saw an opportunity to increase their regional influence. They crowned Tengku Hussein in Singapore, and he took the title [[Hussein Shah of Johor]].<ref name="sgmindef1997">{{cite web|url=http://www.mindef.gov.sg/imindef/about_us/history/the_early_years/v01n02b_history.html|title=1819 – The February Documents|author=Jenny Ng|date=7 February 1997|publisher=[[Ministry of Defence (Singapore)]]|access-date=18 July 2006}}</ref><ref name="Supreme Court, Singapore">{{cite web|url=http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=39l|title=Milestones in Singapore's Legal History|publisher=[[Supreme Court, Singapore]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927183512/http://app.supremecourt.gov.sg/default.aspx?pgID=39l|archive-date=27 September 2007|url-status=dead|access-date=18 July 2006}}</ref> The British were actively involved in the Johor-Riau administration between 1812 and 1818, and their intervention further strengthened their dominance in the Strait of Malacca.

A Dutch garrison was then stationed in Riau.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://workmall.com/wfb2001/singapore/singapore_history_johore_sultanate.html|title=Singapore-Johor Sultanate|date=December 1989|publisher=Countries of the world}}</ref> The Dutch also secured an agreement that Dutch consent was required for all future appointments of Johor-Riau Sultans. This agreement was signed by Yang Dipertuan Muda Raja Jaafar representing Abdul Rahman, without the sultan's consent or knowledge.<ref name="Matheson 1989 153–172"/>

Just as the British, both the Dutch and Yang Dipertuan Muda then desperately tried to win the royal regalia from Engku Puteri. The reluctant Abdul Rahman, believing he was not the rightful heir, decided to move from Lingga to [[Terengganu]], claiming that he wanted to celebrate his marriage. The Dutch, who desired to control the Johor-Riau Empire, feared losing momentum because of the absence of mere regalia. They therefore ordered Timmerman Tyssen, the Dutch Governor of Malacca, to seize Penyengat in October 1822 and remove the royal regalia from Tengku Hamidah by force. The regalia was then stored in the crown prince's fort in Tanjung Pinang. Engku Puteri was reported to have written a letter to [[Godert van der Capellen|Van Der Capellen]], the Dutch Governor in Batavia, about this issue. With the royal regalia in Dutch hands, Abdul Rahman was invited from Terengganu and proclaimed as the Sultan of Johor, Riau-Lingga and Pahang on 27 November 1822. Hence, the legitimate ruler of the Johor-Riau Empire was now Abdul Rahman, rather than the British-backed Hussein.{{sfn|Trcocki, 2007}}

This led to the [[Partition (politics)|partition]] of Johor-Riau under the Anglo-Dutch treaty of 1824, by which the region north of the [[Singapore Strait]] including the island of Singapore and Johor were to be under British influence, while the south of the strait along with Riau and Lingga were to be controlled by the Dutch.

The globalization of the 19th century opened new opportunities for the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. Proximity Singapore, 40 miles away, shaped the political climate of the kingdom, giving Riau Malays an opportunity to familiarize themselves with new ideas from the Middle East. The opening of [[Suez Canal]] meant a journey to [[Mecca]] via [[Port Said]], [[Egypt]] and Singapore could take no more than a fortnight; thus these cities became major ports for the [[Hajj]] pilgrimage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://batampos.co.id/04-11-2014/meneroka-peran-cendekiawan-kerajaan-riau-lingga-dalam-menentang-belanda-2/|title=Meneroka Peran Cendekiawan Kerajaan Riau-Lingga dalam Menentang Belanda (2)|date=4 November 2014|publisher=Batampos.co.id|location=Batam|language=id|access-date=21 January 2020|archive-date=14 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114135605/http://batampos.co.id/04-11-2014/meneroka-peran-cendekiawan-kerajaan-riau-lingga-dalam-menentang-belanda-2/|url-status=dead}}</ref> Inspired by the experience and intellectual progress attained in the Middle East and influenced by the [[Pan-Islamism]] brotherhood, the Riau Malay intelligentsia established the Roesidijah (Club) Riouw in 1895.

It was also viewed that the penetration of the west in the state was slowly tearing apart the fabric of the [[Malayness|Malay-Muslim]] identity.

By the dawn of the 20th century, the association had become a political tool against colonial power, with Raja Muhammad Thahir and Raja Ali Kelana acting as its backbone. Diplomatic missions were sent to the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1883, 1895 and in 1905 to secure the liberation of the kingdom by Raja Ali Kelana, accompanied by a renowned [[Patani (historical region)|Pattani]]-born [[Ulema]], Syeikh Wan Ahmad Fatani.<ref>{{Cite conference |last=Kadı|first=İsmail Hakkı |title=The Ottomans and Southeast Asia Prior to the Hamidian Era: A Critique of Colonial Perceptions of Ottoman–Southeast Asian Interaction |editor=A.C.S.

The organisation also won support from the ''Mohakamah'' (Malay Judiciary) and the ''Dewan Kerajaan'' (Sultanate Administrative Board). Its activities outraged the Dutch.

The movement was an early form of [[Malay nationalism]]. Non-violent and [[Nonviolent resistance|passive resistance]] measures were adopted by the association. The main method of the movement was to hold symbolic boycotts. The Dutch then branded the movement as a passive resistance ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''leidelek verset''), and passive acts such as ignoring the raising of the Dutch flag were met with anger by the [[History of Jakarta|Batavia]]-based ''Raad van Indie'' (Dutch East Indies Council) and the Advisor on Native Affairs, [[Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje]]. Hurgronje wrote a secret letter to the ''Raad van Indie'', advocating that the sultanate and association be crushed as resistance in the earlier [[Aceh War]] had been. Hurgronje justified this with several arguments, among which were that since 1902 the members of the Roesidijah Klub would gather around the royal court and refuse to raise the Dutch flag on government vessels. The Dutch Colonial Resident in Riau, A.L. Van Hasselt advised the [[Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies]] that the Sultan was an opponent to the Dutch and immersed with a group of hardcore resistance. Later, on 1 January 1903, the Dutch Colonial Resident found that the [[Flag of the Netherlands|Dutch flag]] was not being raised during his visit to the royal palace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/verzeparty-dan-lydelyk-verzet-perdirian-roesidijah-club-riouw-1890-an-1991/|title=Verzeparty dan Lydelyk Verzet: Perdirian Roesidijah (Club) Riouw 1890-an −1991|date=2 January 2013|website=TanjungPinang Pos|access-date=15 August 2019|archive-date=26 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190626145827/http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/verzeparty-dan-lydelyk-verzet-perdirian-roesidijah-club-riouw-1890-an-1991/|url-status=dead}}</ref> In his report to the governor he wrote; "it seems that he (Sultan Abdul Rahman II) acted as if he was a sovereign king and he raises his own flag".

[[File:Abdul Rahman II.jpg|left|upright|thumb|Abdul Rahman II of Riau Lingga, the last sultan of Riau-Lingga sultanate. He was subsequently deposed by the Dutch and went into exile]]

On 18 May 1905, the Dutch demanded a new agreement with the sultan, stipulating further limits on the powers of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate, requiring that the [[Dutch flag]] must be raised higher than the flag of Riau, and specifying that Dutch officials should be given supreme honor in the land. The agreement further stipulated that the Riau-Lingga Sultanate was a mere loan from the Dutch Government. The agreement was drawn up due to the fact that the appointment of Sultan Abdul Rahman II had not been made with the consent of the Dutch and he was also clearly against colonial rule.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbtanjungpinang/2014/06/08/sejarah-kerajaan-riau-lingga-kepulauan-riau/|title=Sejarah Kerajaan Riau-Lingga Kepulauan Riau|date=8 June 2014|publisher=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Tanjung Pinang, [[Ministry of Education and Culture (Indonesia)|Ministry of Education and Culture]]|location=Tanjung Pinang|language=id|access-date=21 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402173548/http://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbtanjungpinang/2014/06/08/sejarah-kerajaan-riau-lingga-kepulauan-riau/|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The Dutch insisted that the sultan sign the agreement, but after consulting the fellow rulers of the state, Engku Kelana, Raja Ali, Raja Hitam and other members of the ruling elite, he refused, and decided to form a military regiment under the leadership of the prince regent, Tengku Umar. During a visit of the Dutch Resident's visit to Penyengat, the sultan then, on his own authority and without Dutch approval, summoned the rulers of Reteh, Gaung and Mandah, making the Resident feel as if he was being intimidated by the sultanate. The affiliates of the Roesidijah Klub, mainly the members of the administrative class, were thus able to slowly maneuver Abdul Rahman, once a supporter of Dutch rule, to act against the colonial power's wishes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jantungmelayu.com/2017/09/roesidijah-club-riouw-p-penjengat/|title=Roesidijah (Club) Riouw P.

A mass exodus of civilians and officials to [[Johor]] and Singapore then took place. To avoid violence and the death of civilians in Pulau Penyengat, the sultan and his officials decided not to fight the Dutch troops. The sultan and ''Tengku Ampuan'' (the Queen) left Pulau Penyengat and sailed to Singapore in the royal vessel ''Sri Daik'', while Crown Prince Raja Ali Kelana, Khalid Hitam and the resistance movement in Bukit Bahjah followed a couple of days later. The deposed Abdul Rahman II was forced to live in exile in Singapore, where he died there in 1930 and was buried in Keramat Bukit Kasita, Kampung Bahru Road.

The Dutch officially annexed the sultanate to avoid future claims from the monarchy. Dutch direct rule over the Riau Archipelago began in 1913, and the province was administered as part of the Residency of Riau and Dependencies ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Residentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden''). The Dutch Residency consisted of Tanjung Pinang, Lingga, the [[Riau]] mainland and [[Indragiri River|Indragiri]], while the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]] was administered separately as part of the Pulau-Tujuh Division ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Afdeeling Poelau-Toedjoeh'').<ref name="hubert-herald1">{{cite web|url=http://www.hubert-herald.nl/IndoRiau.htm|title=Riau|date=11 November 2010|publisher=Hubert de Vries|location=Amsterdam}}</ref>

=== Japanese occupation and Independence ===
{{Main|Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Indonesian National Revolution}}
When [[South-East Asian theatre of World War II|World War II]] broke out, the Dutch initially seemed reluctant to defend their territories in the [[Dutch East Indies|East Indies]]. This led the British to consider creating a [[buffer state]] in Riau. They discussed prospects for a restoration with Tengku Omar and Tengku Besar, descendants of the sultans, who were then based in [[Terengganu]]. However, as the war approached Southeast Asia, the Dutch actively engaged in the defensive system alongside the British, and decided to shelve the restoration plan.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}
[[File:Kliping-Koran-Tentang-Gerakan-Sultan-Riau.jpg|thumb|An article by H. M. Hassan entitled "The Singapore heir to the [[Riau Archipelago|Rhio Islands]]" published in ''[[The Straits Times]]''.]]
In the aftermath of the war and the struggle against Dutch rule, several exile associations collectively known as the ''Gerakan Kesultanan Riau'' (Riau Sultanate Movement) emerged in Singapore, planning for a restoration. Some of the groups dated from as early as the dissolution of the sultanate, but started to gain momentum following the post-world war chaos. From the ashes of political uncertainty and fragility in the East Indies following the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies#End of the occupation|World War II]], a [[royalist]] faction known as the Association of the Indigenous Riau Malays ([[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Persatoean Melayu Riouw Sedjati'') (PMRS) emerged to call for the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate. The council was financially backed by rich Riau Malay émigrés and Chinese merchants who hoped to obtain tin concession. Initially founded in High Street, Singapore, the association moved to Tanjung Pinang, Riau with the unprecedented approval by the Dutch administrators. Based in Tanjung Pinang, the group managed to gain the consent of the Dutch for self-governance in the region with the foundation of the Riouw Council ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Riouw Raad'', [[Malay language|Malay]]: ''Dewan Riouw''). The Riouw Council was the devolved national unicameral legislature of Riau, a position equivalent to a Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/58742/gerakan-sultan-riau-1946-1950-habis/|title=Gerakan Sultan Riau|date=9 February 2013|work=Tanjung Pinang Post|location=Tanjung Pinang|language=id|access-date=21 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402162416/http://www.tanjungpinangpos.co.id/2013/58742/gerakan-sultan-riau-1946-1950-habis/|archive-date=2 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After establishing itself in Tanjung Pinang, the group formed a new organisation known as ''Djawatan Koewasa Pengoeroes Rakjat Riow'' (The Council of Riau People Administration), with the members hailing from Tudjuh Archipelago, [[Great Karimun]], Lingga and [[Singkep]]. The group strongly advocated the restoration of the Riau-Lingga Sultanate after the status of Indonesia became official. The leader of the council, Raja Abdullah, claimed that Riau Malays were neglected at the expense of the non-Riau Indonesians who dominated the upper ranks of the Riau civil administration. By restoring the monarch, they believed the position of Riau Malays would be guarded. The royalist association met with resistance from the republican group led by Dr. Iljas Datuk Batuah that sent delegates to Singapore to counter the propaganda of sultanate supporters. Based on Indonesian archival records, Dr. Iljas gained approvals from non-Malay newcomers to Riau, including [[Minang people|Minangkabau]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Palembang people|Palembang]], and [[Batak people|Batak]]. He later formed a group known as the ''Badan Kedaulatan Indonesia Riouw'' (BKRI) (Indonesian Riau Sovereign Body) on 8 October 1945. The organisation sought to absorb the Riau Archipelago into the then-[[Indonesian National Revolution|newly independent Indonesia]], as the archipelago was still retained by the Dutch. BKRI hoped that the new administration under [[Sukarno]] would give the [[pribumis]] a fair chance to run the local government.

The royalist association would not give any public support to the Indonesian movement, as is evident in its refusal to display the ''Bendera Merah-Putih'' ([[Indonesian Flag]]) during the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Indonesian Independence Day]] celebration on 17 August 1947 in Singapore. This led republicans to call the royalists 'pro-Dutch'. The royalists however, maintained that Riau was a Dutch territory and that only the Dutch could support it. The Dutch countered the claims of the BKRI by granting autonomous rule to the Riau Council, in which links with the Dutch would be maintained while a restored sultanate would play a secondary role. The council, created following the decree of the Governor General of the East Indies on 12 July 1947, was inaugurated on 4 August 1947, and represented a major step forward in the revival of the monarchy system. Several key members of the PMRS were elected to the Riau Council alongside their BKRI rivals, the {{transliteration|zh|italic=no|[[Kapitan Cina|Chinese kapitans]]}} from Tanjung Pinang and Pulau Tujuh, local Malay leaders of Lingga and Dutch Officials in Tanjung Pinang. On 23 January 1948, the states of the Bangka Council, the Belitung Council, and the Riau Council merged to form the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation'' which in the following year was admitted as part of the [[United States of Indonesia]] - with seats in the federal People's Representative Council and Senate.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f3iIDAAAQBAJ&q=federasi+bangka+belitung+dan+riau&pg=PT85|title=Antara Daerah dan Negara: Indonesia Tahun 1950-an|last1=Bemmelen|first1=Sita van|last2=Raben|first2=Remco|date=2011|publisher=Yayasan Pustaka Obor Indonesia|isbn=9789794617724|language=id}}</ref>

The call for revival of the sultanate continued throughout the period of autonomous rule under the Riau Council, although the influence of republicanism also continued to strengthen. The appeal of revival began to subside following the dissolution of the ''Bangka Belitung and Riau Federation'' on 4 April 1950. After the official withdrawal by the Dutch in 1950, the Riau Archipelago became ''Keresidenan Riau'' under [[Sumatra|Central Sumatra Province]] under the United States of Indonesia. Being one of the last territories merged into Indonesia, Riau was known as the ''daerah-daerah pulihan'' (recovered regions), and the Riau area became a province in August 1957 - composed of both the islands and parts of the mainland, formerly part of the [[Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura]].

The leader of Riau forces, Major Raja Muhammad Yunus, who led the bid to reestablish the sultanate apart from Indonesia fled into exile in Johor after his ill attempt.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ck13DAAAQBAJ&q=Raja+Muhammad+Yunus+riau&pg=PA250|title=The SIJORI Cross-Border Region: Transnational Politics, Economics, and Culture|last1=Hutchinson|first1=Francis E.|last2=Chong|first2=Terence|date=14 June 2016|publisher=ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute|isbn=9789814695589}}</ref> The Geopolitical roots of the Riau Archipelago had molded her nationalist position to be sandwiched between the kindred monarchist Peninsular [[Early Malay nationalism|Malay Nationalist]] observed across the border in [[British Malaya]] with the pro-republic and pan-ethnic [[Indonesian National Awakening|Indonesian Nationalism]] manifested in her own Dutch East Indies domain.

=== Contemporary era ===
{{Main|Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation}}
After the war, from 1950 the Riau archipelago was a duty-free zone till the [[Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia-Malaysia confrontation]] in 1963. During this period, the [[Malaya and British Borneo dollar]] used in [[British Malaya]] was the principal currency in the region.<ref name="Nordholt, p.447-448">Nordholt, pp. 447–448</ref> To affirm its fiscal stake in the region, a decree was passed on 15 October 1963 to replace the Malaya and British Borneo dollar (the circulating currency) with an Indonesian-issued currency, the [[Riau rupiah]], which replaced the dollar at par. Although the rupiah resembled the [[Indonesian rupiah]] in appearance, having a much higher value. Malayan money was withdrawn from 1 November 1963. The Riau rupiah was exchangeable as a foreign currency with the Indonesian rupiah. Since 1 July 1964, the Riau rupiah is no longer valid, being replaced by the [[Indonesian rupiah]] at a rate of 1 Riau rupiah = 14.7 Indonesian rupiah.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.kompasiana.com/andirwansyah/asal-usul-mata-uang-rupiah_552029f8813311bd729de195|title=Asal Usul Mata Uang Rupiah|last=Kompasiana.com|website=KOMPASIANA|date=27 October 2013 |language=id|access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref>

Due to its proximity to Singapore and [[Peninsular Malaysia]], the Riau Islands area became the focus point during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. During this period, the territorial waters of the Riau Islands began to be visited by many Indonesian military forces who were members of the Indonesian Operations Command Corps or better known as the [[Indonesian Marine Corps]]. The city of [[Batam]] became one of the staging point of Indonesian troops during the confrontation, with the construction of military bases around the city.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k9iDCgAAQBAJ&q=sejarah+konfrontasi+di+batam&pg=PA273 |title=Bibliografi Beranotasi : Hasil Penelitian Balai Pelestarian Sejarah dan Nilai Tradisional Tanjungpinang |last=Tarigan|first=Dra Nismawati|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Direktorat Jenderal Kebudayaan|language=id}}</ref> Anti-Malaysian guerrillas were gathered at Tanjung Balai Karimun to be trained and then sent to [[Sambu Island]] for briefing before operation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/187937-ID-konfrontasi-indonesia-malaysia-tahun-196.pdf |title=Indonesia-Malaysia Confrontation in 1963–1966 (The Economic Impacts on Society in Tanjung Balai Karimun) |last1=Perdana |first1=Imantri |last2=Melay |first2=Ridwan |access-date=17 October 2019|author3=Kamaruddin}}</ref> These guerrillas aimed to sabotage and spread information to help Indonesia fight the British in Malaysia, disrupting the economy around the Riau Islands, especially Tanjung Balai Karimun.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Perdana |first=Imantri |title=Konfrontasi Indonesia |url=https://www.academia.edu/20859805 |website=Academia }}</ref> At that time, [[KOPASKA]] special forces of the [[Indonesian Navy]] infiltrated Singapore from military bases in the Riau Islands, around Batam, Tanjung Balai Asahan and the surrounding area.

[[File:Batam Harbour Bay Downtown.jpg|thumb|In the 1970s, the city of Batam started an industrial boom, which continues to this day]]
The end of the Indonesia-Singapore trade during the confrontation had made the disnurmud the economic conditions of the Riau Islands and Singapore. The inhabitants of Riau Islands could no longer barter or sell their produce to Singapore so they couldn't get basic necessities such as rice. Usually the basic needs of the Riau Islands population were brought in more from Singapore instead of the rest of Indonesia. Even some of the some needs of Singapore residents were usually imported from the Riau Islands has been disrupted.<ref name=":7" /> Hostilities ceased in 1966 after the [[30 September Movement]] attempted a coup d'état, resulting in the overthrow of the Sukarno regime which leads to a peace agreement between Indonesia and Malaysia that was signed on 28 May 1966 at [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Carver |first=Michael |date=1986 |chapter=Conventional Warfare in the Nuclear Age |editor-last=Paret |editor-first=Peter |title=The Makers of Modern Strategy: From Machiavelli to the Nuclear Age |publisher=Princeton University Press |isbn=9780691027647 |page=806}}</ref>

With the initial aim of making Batam an Indonesian version of Singapore, according to Presidential Decree number 41 of 1973, Batam Island was designated as an industrial working area. This was supported by the Batam Island Industrial Area Development Authority, better known as the Batam Authority Agency (BOB) which is now the Batam Development Board ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Badan Pengusahan Batam'' or ''BP Batam''). In the 1980s, based on Government Regulation No. 34 of 1983, the Batam District was upgraded to the Batam Municipality. This body runs the government and community administration and supports the development carried out by the Batam Authority (BP Batam).

Some level of unity returned in the Riau region for the first time after 150 years, with the creation of the [[Sijori Growth Triangle]] in 1989. But while bringing back some wealth to Riau, the Sijori Growth Triangle somewhat further broke the cultural unity within the islands. With [[Batam]] island receiving most of the industrial investments and dramatically developing into a regional industrial centre, it attracted hundreds of thousands of non-Malay Indonesian migrants, changing the demographic balance in the archipelago.<ref>{{Citation|author1=Long, Nicholas J|title=Being Malay in Indonesia : histories, hopes and citizenship in the Riau Archipelago|year=2013|publisher=Singapore Asian Studies Association of Australia in association with NUS Press and NIAS Press|isbn=978-9971-69-769-3}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|author1=Riau Roundtable (2007 : Singapore)|title=Opportunities and challenges in the Riau Archipelago and the Riau Province : report on a conference organized by the Indonesian Programme of the S.

== Politics ==

=== Government ===
{{Main|Politics of Indonesia}}
The province of Riau Island is led by a governor (''gubernur'') who is elected directly by the people. The Governor also acts as a representative or extension of the central government in the province, whose authority is regulated in Law No. 32 of 2004 and Government Regulation number 19 of 2010. The legislative branch of the Riau Island government is the Riau Islands Regional People's Representatives Assembly ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Kepulauan Riau – DPRD Kepri''), which is considered as a unicameral legislative body. Both governors and the members of the assembly are elected by citizens every five years by [[universal suffrage]]. Prior to this, the local executives had been elected by a vote of the assembly.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AFy9X_i9_q8C&pg=PA232|title=Deepening Democracy in Indonesia?: Direct Elections for Local Leaders (Pilkada)|last1=Erb|first1=Maribeth|last2=Sulistiyanto|first2=Priyambudi|date=2009|publisher=Institute of Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=9789812308412|page=232}}</ref> The governor office and the province assembly are located in Basuki Rahmat Road at Pulau Dompak, [[Tanjung Pinang]].

The number of members of the assembly is at least thirty-five people and at most one hundred people with a term of office of five years and ends when the new assembly member takes an oath.

Prior to Dutch colonization, most of the modern-day province of Riau Islands is part of the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate]]. The sultanate was headed by a [[Sultan]].The Sultan, who was a Malay, acted as [[Head of State]] while the ''Dipertuan Muda/Yamtuan Muda'' (deputy ruler or Viceroy), a position held by the [[Bugis]] ruling elite, served as the [[Head of Government]].  The sultan's royal palace was located in [[Penyengat Island|Penyengat Inderasakti]], while the ''Yang Dipertuan Muda'' resided in [[Daik]], Lingga. After becoming a Dutch protectorate, a Dutch resident was installed as an adviser to the sultan. For the hereditary position of the Sultan, the sultan was fully subjected under the influence of the [[Dutch East Indies]] authority. Albeit he is [[de jure]] on the apex of the monarchy system, he is under the direct control of the Dutch Resident in [[Tanjung Pinang]]. All matters pertaining the administration of the sultanate including the appointment of the Sultan and the ''Yang Dipertuan Muda,'' must be made within the knowledge and even the consent of the Dutch Resident.

After the Dutch fully annexed the sultanate, a Dutch resident was posted in Tanjung Pinang, heading the Residency of Riau and Dependencies. During the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|3 years of Japanese occupation]], Japanese military officers and local Indonesian nationalist leaders headed the region.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Indonesia}}
This province is divided into five regencies (''kabupaten'') and two autonomous [[Cities of Indonesia|cities]] (''kota''). These are subdivided into 70 districts (''kecamatan'') and then into 256 villages (''desa'' or ''kelurahan''). Each regency is headed by a regent (''bupati''), while each district is headed by a district chief (''camat'') and each village headed by a village chief (known as a ''kepala desa'' or ''[[penghulu]]'') for each village in the district.<ref name="indonesia">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7V-aAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA59|title=Indonesia Country Study Guide Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments|date=2013|publisher=International Business Publications|isbn=9781438774619|page=59}}{{Dead link|date=July 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

During the Dutch East Indies era, the Riau Islands was included in the Residency of Riau and Dependencies ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: R''esidentie Riouw en Onderhoorigheden''), which is also based in [[Tanjung Pinang]].

=== Geography and Climate ===
[[File:Tanjung Piayu Batam.jpg|thumb|Tanjung Piayu, a scenic area in Batam]]
The total area of the Riau Islands is {{cvt|8,269.71|km2}} (3,192.95 sq miles), making it the 31st largest province in Indonesia, slightly smaller than the province of [[Banten]] in [[Java]]. 96% of the total area of the province is encompassed of ocean and only 4% of it is encompassed of land. The province shares maritime borders with [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]] to the north, the province of [[Bangka Belitung Islands]] and [[Jambi]] in the south, [[East Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and the province of [[West Kalimantan]] in the east and [[Peninsular Malaysia]], Singapore and mainland [[Riau]] in the west.

The island of [[Batam]], which lies within the central core group of islands (the Riau Archipelago), contains a majority of the province's population. Since becoming part of an economic zone with Singapore in 2006, it has experienced high population growth rates. Other highly populated islands in the Riau Archipelago include [[Bintan Island|Bintan]] and [[Great Karimun|Karimun]], while the archipelago also includes islands such as [[Bulan Island|Bulan]] and [[Kundur Island|Kundur]]. There are around 3,200 islands in the province, which has its capital at [[Tanjung Pinang]] in the south of Bintan Island. The Riau Islands province includes the [[Lingga Islands]] to the south of the main [[Riau Archipelago]], while to the northeast lies the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], between [[Borneo]] and mainland [[Malaysia]]; the Tudjuh Archipelago consists of four distinct groups – the [[Anambas Islands]], [[Natuna Islands]], [[Tambelan Archipelago|Tambelan]] islands and [[Badas Islands]] — which were attached to the new province, though not geographically part of the Riau Archipelago. The 2020 census count was 2,064,564, making it one of the fastest growing province in Indonesia; the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 2,162,100, confirming continued growth.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2024.</ref>

With strategic geographical location (between [[South China Sea]], [[Malacca Strait]] and [[Karimata Strait]]) and supported by an abundance of natural potential, Riau Islands could possibly become one of the economic growth centers for Indonesia in the future, especially now that in some areas of the Riau Islands (Batam, Bintan and Karimun), a pilot project for the development of a [[Special economic zone]] is being pursued through cooperation with the [[Government of Singapore|Singaporean government]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://finance.detik.com/berita-ekonomi-bisnis/d-4385464/jadi-zona-perdagangan-bebas-batam-dinilai-mampu-lampaui-singapura|title=Jadi Zona Perdagangan Bebas, Batam Dinilai Mampu Lampaui Singapura|last=Hamdani|first=Trio|website=detikfinance|location=[[Jakarta]]|publisher=[[Detik.com|detikcom]]|access-date=8 August 2019}}</ref> The implementation of the SEZ policy in Batam-Bintan-Karimun, is a close cooperation between the central government and local government, and the participation of the business world.

As an archipelago, the climatic conditions in the province are affected by wind. Most of the province has wet tropical climate, there is rainy season and dry season interspersed with transition season with the lowest average temperature 20.4&nbsp;°C. In November to February monsoon winds comes from the north and between June and December the monsoon winds comes from the south. During the northern monsoon the wind velocity at sea could range from 20 to 30 knots, on land the wind can range from 3–15 knots. This causes potentially extreme weather in the Riau Islands with rainfall of about 150–200 millimeters and wave height between 1.2 meters up to 3 meters.
As in most other province of Indonesia, the Riau Islands has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Af'') bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall. According to Köppen and Geiger, this climate is classified as Af. In the Riau Islands, the average annual temperature is 25.2&nbsp;°C. Precipitation here averages 2607&nbsp;mm.<ref>

Oceanographic conditions, mainly wave and sea water current, in the study sites were influenced by wet monsoon period, i.e. from November to April. During the wet monsoon (wet season) the wind is characterized very strong, which blows from North-west to South-east or from South-west to North-east, with velocity ranges 7–20 knot (≈ 13–37&nbsp;km/hour). The strongest wind usually occurs in around December–February, with velocity is about 45&nbsp;km/hour.<ref>Soegiarto and Birowo, 1975</ref><ref name=":8">{{Cite web|url=https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/93763-EN-effects-of-sand-mining-on-coral-reefs-in.pdf|title=Effects of Sand Mining on Coral Reefs in Riau Islands|last=Supriharyono|date=20 January 2004|access-date=18 October 2019}}</ref> During this season the sea wave may very high, sometime > 2 m especially during December–February. While the east monsoon (dry season), it usually occur in period of May to October, with wind velocity is relatively calm, that is about 7- 15 knot (≈ 13–28&nbsp;km/hour). The sea wave was not very high reaching only around 0.8 m.<ref name=":8" /><ref>PT Wahana Barelang, 2001</ref> The sea water current in Riau islands follows the current pattern in [[Malacca strait]]. It is depends on the different between seawater level in northern part of [[Andaman Sea]] and southern part of Malacca Strait. Since seawater level in Pacific Ocean is always higher than in Indian Oceans, the seawater level in [[South China Sea]] is also higher than in Andaman Sea throughout the year resulted in Malacca Strait there is a current, which flow to Northwest direction throughout the year. In November to April, during the Northeast monsoon, Andaman Sea's current goes to the north. Therefore, majority of water masses are transported to the north. Consequent of this, during these months, Andaman Sea's water masses will be empty, and sea water level will be low or the different from South China Sea's sea water level will be higher. This sea water level reaches to maximum in February to March, while the different of sea water level between Northern and southern parts of Strait is about 50&nbsp;cm, which resulted current velocity is about 12&nbsp;cm/sec to Northwest.<ref name=":8" />

Conversely, during the southwest monsoon, May to October, most of the currents in western part of [[Andaman Sea]] go to east and south, therefore water masses will be gathering in Andaman Sea. This resulted in that sea water level increases in northern part of [[Strait of Malacca|Malacca Strait]], and the different of sea water level to [[South China Sea]]’s water level will be small, although in southern part of the Strait the sea water level is still higher. During this season, the water current in Malacca Strait flows to the north, with speed is little bit lower. Current velocity reaches to maximum in around July to August, with speed about 5&nbsp;cm/sec. Oceanographic pattern is likely to affect the water quality and reef corals in the study sites. Strong wind during the wet monsoon period, for example, could cause water turbulence which affecting on high sediment, especially in coastal areas, and this might be worse with the high sediment run off from surrounding rivers and/or reclamation areas, such as happened in [[Batam]]. Water turbidity was recorded about 22 NTU during the wet season, and it is lower (about 7.4 NTU) in the dry season.<ref name=":8" /><ref>Dasminto, 2003</ref>

The geographical position of the Riau Islands, which is close to neighboring countries located near the [[Strait of Malacca]], which is one of the busiest shipping lane in the world, is also a major factor in the need to increase competitiveness. The geographical location can be a leverage in attracting foreign and domestic investors. However, the strategic geographical location will not provide benefits if the Riau Islands do not have competitiveness. This is because skilled workers and investors are more interested in areas that have competitiveness than regions that are not competitive. Therefore, increasing competitiveness is a necessity to attract investors, both foreign and domestic, to invest in the economic development of the Riau Islands.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web|url=http://setnas-asean.id/site/uploads/document/journals/file/59b0f338090d8-17-cluster-ekonomi-stisipol-raja-haji.pdf|title=Riau Islands in facing the ASEAN economic community|last1=Karim|first1=Zamzami A.|last2=Rianto|first2=Faizal|access-date=17 October 2019|archive-date=19 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719195958/http://setnas-asean.id/site/uploads/document/journals/file/59b0f338090d8-17-cluster-ekonomi-stisipol-raja-haji.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The economic growth rate of Riau Islands Province in 2005 was 6.57%.<ref name=":6">{{Cite web|url=https://barenlitbangkepri.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Kajian_dan_Analisis_SDM-2005-2013.pdf|title=Kajian dan Analisis Sumber Daya Manusia (Tinjauan IPM) Provinsi Kepulauan Riau Tahun 2005–2013|date=1 September 2014|publisher=[[Statistics Indonesia]]|location=Tanjungpinang|language=id|trans-title=Study and Analysis of Human Resources (HDI review) in the Riau Islands 2005–2013|access-date=17 October 2019}}</ref> Sectors that grew well (faster than the total [[Gross regional domestic product|GRDP]] growth) in 2005 included the transportation and communication sector (8.51%), the manufacturing sector (7.41%), the financial sector, leasing, and corporate services (6.89%), the service sector (6.77%), and the trade, hotel and restaurant sector (6.69%). GRDP Per capita of the Riau Islands in the last five years (2001–2005) tends to increase. In 2001 the GRDP per capita (above the prevailing price – without oil and gas) was Rp. 22,808 million, and in 2005 it increased to Rp.29,348&nbsp;million. But in real terms (without calculating inflation) the Per capita GRDP (without gas) in 2001 was only Rp.20,397&nbsp;million, and in 2005 it increased to Rp. 22,418&nbsp;million.<ref name=":6" />

The potential of natural wealth in the Riau Islands comes from mining and the [[Process manufacturing|manufacturing]] industries. The manufacturing sector contributes more than 35% and the processing industry accounts for 15.26% of the economy in Riau Islands with oil and gas commodities. In addition to the mining sector, community economic activities are dominant in the agriculture, plantation and forestry sectors. Riau Islands economic growth continued to decline in the period 2011–2014, then increased in 2014. During the period 2011–2014, the economic performance of the Riau Islands had an average growth rate of 6.31%.<ref name=":4" />

In 2017, the manufacturing sector formed the largest GDP per share in the province, forming around 36.8% of the total GDP per share of the province.<ref name="GDP by province 2017">{{Cite web|url=https://www.bps.go.id/publication/download.html?nrbvfeve=YzM5NjA5ZDdlYmU4NWI3OGM1N2E4NWE2&xzmn=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYnBzLmdvLmlkL3B1YmxpY2F0aW9uLzIwMTgvMDcvMjcvYzM5NjA5ZDdlYmU4NWI3OGM1N2E4NWE2L3Byb2R1ay1kb21lc3Rpay1yZWdpb25hbC1icnV0by1wcm92aW5zaS1wcm92aW5zaS1kaS1pbmRvbmVzaWEtbWVudXJ1dC1sYXBhbmdhbi11c2FoYS0yMDEzLTIwMTcuaHRtbA%3D%3D&twoadfnoarfeauf=MjAxOS0xMC0xNyAxNTo0Mjo1MA%3D%3D|title=Gross Regional Domestic Product of Indonesia by Industry|author=Statistics Indonesia|date=27 July 2018|access-date=17 October 2019|author-link=Statistics Indonesia}}</ref> Based on the main commodities, [[Fossil fuel|mineral fuels]], machinery and electrical equipment remain the mainstay trade of the Riau Islands. This type of commodity has not changed significantly compared to previous years. This needs to be considered given the expansion of the market must also be accompanied by an expansion of commodities both in quality and type.<ref name=":6" /> Export-oriented electronics manufacturing in Batam, for example, made up half of Indonesian electronics exports in 1991 with foreign companies alone employing 45,000 workers in 2020.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=van Grunsven |first1=Leo |last2=Hutchinson |first2=Francis E. |title=The evolution of the electronics industry on Batam Island (Riau Islands Province, Indonesia): an evolutionary trajectory contributing to regional resilience? |journal=GeoJournal |date=1 June 2017 |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=475–492 |doi=10.1007/s10708-015-9692-9 |language=en |issn=1572-9893|doi-access=free }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Terbaru, Segini Jumlah Perusahaan Asing di Kota Batam Sekarang…. |url=https://batampos.co.id/2020/07/02/terbaru-segini-jumlah-perusahaan-asing-di-kota-batam-sekarang/ |access-date=6 February 2024 |work=batampos.co.id |date=2 July 2020 |language=id}}</ref>

The second largest sector is the Construction industry, forming around 18% of the total GDP sector.<ref name="GDP by province 2017" /> The development of the number of construction businesses in the Riau Islands fluctuated considerably during the period 2008–2010. In 2010 the number of construction companies in the province was 1,570, with the value of construction completed (revenue) of Rp 5,483&nbsp;billion. Number of National Labor Force Survey Results show that the number of residents working in the construction sector has fluctuated from time to time. As many as 43,232 people were recorded in February 2009, then decreased in February 2010 to 29,932 people, again increased in August 2010 to 50,833 people, then decreased in February 2011 to 58,211 and again increased in August 2011 to 59,755 people. Because the Riau Islands is a new developing province and almost half of the existing human resources come from outside the Riau Islands, this has caused housing needs in the Riau Islands to be out of proportion to their availability. This condition also seems to have caused housing costs to rise in the Riau Islands relatively faster than in other regions. The results of the National Socio-Economic Survey show that on average the expenditure per capita of the population for rental costs/housing contracts is the highest type of expenditure for non-food commodities, and the figure tends to increase every year. This fact is in line with the increasing frequency of commodity rental prices in the Riau Islands.<ref name=":6" />
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Indamming van de groeve Sultan Singkep Tin Maatschappij Riouw TMnr 10007347.jpg|left|thumb|Tin mining in [[Singkep]], Lingga Islands]]
The third largest sector is the mining industry.<ref name="GDP by province 2017" /> Riau Islands is the largest [[bauxite]] producing region in Indonesia. This can be seen from the number of [[bauxite mining]] companies. Since 2008, the number of bauxite mining companies has always been the highest compared to other mining companies, although the number has always dropped from 2008 to 2010. In 2009 the number of bauxite companies fell by 37 companies to 32 in 2010. This decline also had an impact on the decline in the number of workers and output produced by this sector. The [[tin]] company is the second largest company in the Riau Islands after bauxite. Tin companies also have the same situation as bauxite companies that are experiencing a decline. The tin company which initially had 25 companies in 2009 decreased to 22 companies in 2010.<ref name=":6" />

A small but significant sector in the province is the agriculture sector, forming around 3.5% of the total GDP sector.<ref name="GDP by province 2017" /> Despite having limited agricultural land, and production of food crops (mainly rice), the Riau Islands have not been able to meet the needs food for its population. This problem is caused by rice productivity that is still low. [[Cassava]] plants have the highest productivity, then [[sweet potato]] and rice plants are ranked third. In 2011, rice productivity in the Riau Islands reached 3.16 tons per hectare, far below the productivity of cassava and sweet potatoes, which amounted to 10.83 tons per hectare and 7.75 tons per hectare, respectively. When viewed from the harvested area and rice production in 2011, it experienced a very small increase as well as productivity. Rice productivity in 2010 was 3.15 tons per hectare, cassava was 10.82 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 7.72 tons per hectare. The increase in productivity of rice and cassava was only 0.01 tons per hectare and sweet potatoes was 0.03 tons per hectare. [[Maize|Corn]] and peanut crops are food crops in Riau Islands with low productivity during 2010–2011. Whereas for corn productivity in 2010 amounted to 2.13 tons per hectare decreased to 2.12 tons per hectare in 2011. While for peanuts the productivity remained, at 0.92 tons per hectare. Decrease in corn productivity is due to the harvested area for maize also has decreased, besides it is also the effect of pests that cause disruption of corn pests.<ref name=":6" /> Plantation and horticultural crops are types of plants that are quite potential to be cultivated in Riau Islands. This is based on the high price of agricultural products produced by these two types of businesses. As shown by the NTP (Farmer Exchange Rate) data, only estate and horticultural farmers have almost certainly an index value above 100. This condition is of course caused by the still higher price of goods produced by farmers compared to the price of goods needed, both for consumption and the cost of production. Production of [[Natural rubber|rubber]] plants in 2011 experienced a very high increase of 118 percent. While [[coconut]] plants experienced a very small increase of 2.4 percent. As for fruit production, in 2011, only [[jackfruit]] and banana increased, where [[jackfruit]] production increased by 5 percent and banana production increased by 50 percent, compared to production in 2010. As for the production of [[pineapple]], [[durian]], orange and [[rambutan]] decreased in 2011.<ref name=":6" />

=== Internet and telecommunication ===
In 2018, the household internet broadband penetration in the Riau Islands is 70%, which is above the Indonesian national figure around 54.86%, according to the survey results from the Indonesian Internet Service Providers Association ([[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]: ''Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia'') (APJII).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://teknologi.bisnis.com/read/20190521/101/925206/setengah-penduduk-di-provinsi-ini-buta-internet|title=Setengah Penduduk di Provinsi Ini Buta Internet |website=Bisnis.com|date=21 May 2019 |access-date=9 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tekno.kompas.com/read/2019/05/16/03260037/apjii-jumlah-pengguna-internet-di-indonesia-tembus-171-juta-jiwa|title=APJII: Jumlah Pengguna Internet di Indonesia Tembus 171 Juta Jiwa|website=kompas.com|date=15 May 2019 |language=id|access-date=9 January 2020}}</ref> Nonetheless, there are still many regions in the Riau Islands that has limited or no internet access, especially around the outlying regions of Anambas and Natuna Islands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kepri.antaranews.com/berita/57792/jaringan-internet-di-anambas-kini-belum-merdeka|title=Jaringan internet di Anambas kini belum merdeka|website=Antara News Kepri|date=19 July 2019 |access-date=9 January 2020}}</ref> Efforts have been taken by the government to improve internet access in the region, such as the construction of the Palapa ring, which is a massive, nationwide internet network using fiber-optic wires that will provide high-speed internet connection throughout the nation. The project aimed to make all the capital cities of regencies and municipalities in Indonesia connected with broadband or high-speed internet infrastructure. The idea was preceded by the difficulties of the outermost, rural, and disadvantaged regions in Indonesia in obtaining adequate telecommunications access.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://properti.kompas.com/read/2019/11/29/145452121/internet-cepat-di-natuna-ini-kata-para-nelayan|title=Internet Cepat di Natuna, Ini Kata Para Nelayan...

Currently Palapa Ring construction has been completed and has also been inaugurated. A number of Indonesian telecommunications operators have begun cooperating with the [[Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (Indonesia)|Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information Technology]] so that the internet network can be accessed smoothly. The Palapa Ring network was completed in late 2019 and was inaugurated by the Indonesian president [[Joko Widodo]] on 14 October 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jakartaglobe.id/tech/indonesia-completes-palapa-ring-internet-superhighway|title=Indonesia Completes Palapa Ring Internet Superhighway|website=Jakarta Globe|date=14 October 2019 |access-date=9 January 2020}}</ref>

Presently, the [[mobile telecommunication]] penetration in the outlying regions of the Riau Islands such as Natuna and Anambas are increasing due to the improvement of telecommunication infrastructure compared to the previous years. Several Indonesian network providers such as [[XL Axiata]] and [[Telkom Indonesia]] has started building more [[BTS tower]] around the region to increase network coverage around the region. XL Axiata has been present in Anambas and Natuna since 2008 with 2G services that use satellite connections and then upgraded to 3G services. In March 2019, XL Axiata inaugurated the 4G data network in the Anambas Islands, by using the West Palapa Ring backbone, in collaboration with the Telecommunications and Information Accessibility Agency (BAKTI) in using the West Palapa Ring network.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://inet.detik.com/telecommunication/d-4831193/jaringan-4g-xl-axiata-selimuti-kepulauan-natuna|title=Jaringan 4G XL Axiata Selimuti Kepulauan Natuna|last=Rahman|first=Adi Fida|website=detikinet|location=[[Jakarta]]|publisher=[[Detik.com|detikcom]]|language=id|access-date=9 January 2020}}</ref> While in 2018, Telkomsel strengthens 4G services in Natuna Regency and Anambas Islands Regency by building two new 4G base transceiver stations.

[[File:Hang Nadim Batam Airport.jpg|left|thumb|[[Hang Nadim International Airport]] in Batam, the busiest airport in the province]]
The province is served by several airports, the largest being [[Hang Nadim International Airport]] in Batam. Originally developed to handle diversions of aircraft from [[Singapore Changi Airport]] in case of an emergency, it has sufficient facilities for wide-body aircraft such as [[Boeing 747]]s. The airport has the longest runway in Indonesia and the second longest runway in Southeast Asia, after [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]], at 4,214 metres (13,825&nbsp;ft) long. The airport serve flights to major Indonesian cities such as [[Jakarta]], [[Medan]], [[Surabaya]] and [[Palembang]], as well as some international destinations such as [[Kuala Lumpur]] in Malaysia and cities in China such as [[Shenzhen]] and [[Xi'an]]. Due to its proximity to Singapore, many people who is travelling abroad usually choose to go to [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] in Singapore since it serves more destinations to other countries compared to Hang Nadim International Airport or [[Soekarno–Hatta International Airport]] in [[Jakarta]].

The second-largest airport in the province is the [[Raja Haji Fisabilillah Airport]] in [[Bintan Island|Bintan]]. It mostly serves flight to Jakarta and destinations within the province such as Batam and Natuna.

Riau Islands is a very diverse and multi-ethnic province. Owing to its proximity to Singapore, many people from other parts of Indonesia has migrated to the province. As of 2010, the ethnic groups in Riau Island consist of [[Malay Indonesian|Malays]] (29.95%), [[Javanese people|Javanese]] (24.95%), [[Batak]] (12.48%), [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] (9.71%), [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] (7.69%), and [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] (2.95%).

The [[Malay Indonesian|Malays]] are the largest ethnic group with a composition of 29.95% of the entire population of the Riau Islands. They are the native people of the [[Riau Archipelago]]. From the ancient times, the Riau Archipelago is considered the hub of Malay cultures. In the past, several Malay kingdoms and sultanates existed in the archipelago, the most notably being the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate]]. A major sub-group of the Malay inhabiting the province is the [[Orang Laut|''Orang laut'']] (sea people).  The ''Orang laut'' are Malays who are [[Nomad]]ic in nature and have a rich marine culture. Presently, many ''Orang laut'' have settled in coastal areas of the province. The ''Orang laut'' are encompasses of numerous tribes and groups inhabiting the islands and estuaries in the Riau-Lingga Archipelagos, the [[Tudjuh Archipelago]], the [[Batam]] Archipelago, and the coasts and offshore islands of eastern [[Sumatra]], southern [[Malay Peninsula|Malaysia Peninsula]] and Singapore.<ref>[http://www.bartelby.net/67/837.html "The Malay Peninsula and Archipelago 1511–1722" ''The Encyclopedia of World History'' 2001];</ref> The geographical condition of the Riau Islands, which has almost 99% of its area as water, has made quite a number of ''Orang Laut'' groups living in this area. In the Riau Islands, the ''Orang laut'' are usually found in islands and river mouths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/orang-laut-kepulauan-riau/|title=Orang Laut Kepulauan Riau|last=dediarman|date=14 June 2016|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref> The ''Orang laut'' are boat-dwelling tribe with main livelihoods as fish finders and other marine animals, such as ''tripang'' ([[sea cucumber]]). This subsystem economic model is the characteristic of their culture. Since the implementation of the policy of relocation of settlements by the [[Government of Indonesia|Indonesian Government]] in the late 1980s to the early 1990s, the customs of the ''Orang laut'' are gradually disappearing.<ref>Chou (2003)</ref><ref>Lenhart (2004)</ref>

The Chinese has inhabited the Riau Islands since the late 18th century]]
Other ethnic group are mostly immigrants coming from different parts of Indonesia. Due to its proximity from [[Singapore]], Riau Islands have become a melting pot for different ethnic groups coming from other parts of Indonesia. The [[Javanese people|Javanese]] is the dominant ethnic group of the immigrants, forming 24.95% of the total population. The Javanese who stayed here are mostly due to the [[Transmigration program]] enacted by the Dutch during the colonial period to reduce the overpopulated Java and continued until the end of the [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]]. Another notable immigrants are the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] (Minang), who mostly originated from [[West Sumatra]]. Owing to its ''rantau'' (migration) culture, many Minangkabau people has migrated away from their homeland. The history of the Minangkabau migration in West Sumatra to the Riau mainland and the Riau Islands has been recorded to have lasted a very long time. When the means of transportation were still using the river, many Minang people migrated to various cities such as [[Tanjung Pinang]] and [[Batam]]. Most of Minangkabau people work as traders, peddlers, and craftsmen, in addition to doctors, lawyers, and journalists.<ref>Universitas Michigan, Geografi Budaya Daerah Riau, 1983</ref>

The [[Chinese-Indonesian|Chinese]] is the fifth largest ethnic group in the province, forming 7.69% of the total population. Chinese traders have frequented the region since at least the 13th century, during the [[Yuan dynasty]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/af451766-b8b1-4d47-824f-78ab79aab805|title=The Yuan in the Straits of Malacca – Singapore History|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref> The mention of ''[[Long Ya Men|Longyamen]]'' ([[Simplified Chinese characters|simplified Chinese]]: 龙牙门; [[Traditional Chinese characters|traditional Chinese]]: 龍牙門; [[pinyin]]: lóngyámén'')'', which means "Dragon's Tooth Strait" in Chinese, first appeared in the ''Yüan shih'' in 1320. In 1325, ''Longyamen'' sent a mission to China with a memorial and tribute.<ref>Hsü, Y.-T. (January 1972). Singapore in the remote past.

Retrieved 29 January 2014, from JSTOR.</ref> The nearby island of [[Bintan Island|Bintan]] had sent an earlier mission in 1323. Thus ''Longyamen'' was already known to the Yuan court before 1320. Another place named ''Longyamen'' appears in 1225 in [[Zhao Rukuo|Zhao Rugua]]’s text. It has been argued that this place was [[Lingga Regency|Lingga]], south of Riau, and that the 14th-century ''Longyamen'' was in that vicinity. It is more probable, however, that the Song text referred to a different place from the Yuan texts. There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that ''Longyamen'' was Singapore in the 14th and 15th centuries.<ref>Chung, C. K. (2005). ''Longyamen is Singapore: The final proof?'' In L.

The capital of the Riau Islands, [[Tanjung Pinang]], is one of the city that has the largest percentage of ethnic Chinese population among other cities in Indonesia, amounting to 13.5% of the total population. Until now some of Tanjung Pinang's economy is driven by the ethnic Chinese community. They not only controlled the small or medium-scale economy, but also developed into large-scale businesses such as shipbuilding, housing, restaurants and hospitality. In addition to moving in the economy, there are some who become politicians, people's representatives, political figures and even civil servants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/menelusuri-jejak-etnis-tionghoa-di-tanjungpinang/|title=Menelusuri Jejak Etnis Tionghoa di Tanjungpinang|last=dediarman|date=6 February 2019|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref> Most of the Chinese in Tanjung Pinang, as well as the Riau Islands in a whole trace their ancestors from [[Fujian]], hence most of them are of [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]] origin, while significant population of [[Teochew people|Teochew]] and [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] origins also exist in the Riau Islands.

Other ethnic groups, such as the [[Batak]] from [[North Sumatra]], the [[Banjar people|Banjarese]] from [[South Kalimantan]] and the [[Buginese people|Buginese]] from [[South Sulawesi]] also inhabit the province, albeit to a lesser extent.

=== Language ===
[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is the official language of the state, as well as the province.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_174556.pdf|title=The 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia, as amended by the First Amendment of 1999, the Second Amendment of 2000, the Third Amendment of 2001 and the Fourth Amendment of 2002.|date=18 August 1945|access-date=21 January 2020|archive-date=11 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171011113409/http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---ed_protect/---protrav/---ilo_aids/documents/legaldocument/wcms_174556.pdf|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, several [[varieties of Malay]] are spoken in the province. There are fifteen different varieties of Malay spoken in the Riau Islands, most of which are [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with Indonesian, which is a standardized form of Malay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/15-dialek-bahasa-melayu-di-kepri/|title=15 Dialek Bahasa Melayu di Kepri|last=dediarman|date=30 September 2018|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref><ref name="The Indonesian Language 2004. Page 14">James Neil Sneddon. ''The Indonesian Language: Its History and Role in Modern Society''. UNSW Press, 2004.

It served as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the province.

The [[Karimun Regency]] has several dialects namely the Kundur dialect and the Bintan-Karimun dialect. In general, it uses the Johor-Riau dialect. The main characteristic of this dialect is the suffix "A" which sounds as "E". The word /saya/ and /apa/ ("I" and "What" respectively) will be pronounced as /saye/ and /ape/ in the Johor-Riau dialect, which is similar to the [[Malaysian Malay|Malay]] used in [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The dialects used in the [[Bintan Regency]] are the Bintan-Karimun dialect, the Malang Rapat-Kelong dialect which is used in Malang Rapat village and Kelong village and the Mantang Lama dialect in Mantang Lama Village in Kijang. The word pronunciation is similar to the Malay used in Tanjung Pinang and Karimun. The Malay used in the [[Lingga Regency]] is also similar to the Malay used in the Karimun and BIitan Regency. The variety of Malay spoken in the province's northernmost regencies, [[Anambas Islands Regency|Anambas]] and [[Natuna Regency|Natuna]], is not only mutually unintelligible to the standard Indonesian language, but also mutually unintelligible to the Malay varieties spoken in Bintan and Karimun. The Anambas Malay dialect slightly resembles the [[Pontianak Malay]] dialect spoken in [[West Kalimantan]] and the Belitung Malay dialect spoken in [[Bangka Belitung Islands|Bangka-Belitung]], especially their vocabulary and phonology. For example, ''kitak'' or ''ketak'' which means you, ''wan'' which means grandma and ''suduk'' which means spoon are both used in Anambas and Pontianak. The Natuna Malay people spoke a dialect of Malay that is influenced by [[Terengganu Malay]] and [[Pahang Malay]] that are spoken in the Malaysian states of [[Terengganu]] and [[Pahang]] respectively, as most of the people living there trace their origins from the eastern coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Historically, the Anambas and Natuna Malays spoke the [[Terengganu Malay]], but its speakers (mostly elderly) are rapidly diminishing and replaced by the local Malay dialects on the islands (to a lesser extent, the usage of standard Indonesian was also the cause of the diminishment of native dialect speakers).<ref>[http://www.mstar.com.my/lain-lain/rencana/2013/12/07/kepulauan-natuna-bergeografikan-malaysia-berdaulatkan-indonesia/ The Natuna Islands: Geographically Malaysian, politically Indonesian], mstar.com.my. 7 December 2013 (in Malay)</ref> The ''[[Orang Laut]]'' people also spoke their own variety of Malay which is still related to the Malay spoken in the Batam-Bintan area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.genpi.co/hits-style/7443/kepulauan-riau-beda-tempat-lain-dialek-melayunya|title=GenPI.co|website=GenPI.co|date=8 March 2019|language=id|access-date=14 August 2019}}</ref>

Traditionally, the Malay language is written in [[Jawi script]] (locally known in Indonesia as "Arab-Melayu"), an Arabic-based writing.<ref>{{cite book|title=How complex are isolating languages?|last=Gil|first=David|publisher=Benjamins|year=2008|editor1-last=Miestamo|editor1-first=Matti|series=Language complexity: Typology, contact, change (Studies in Language Companion Series 94)|location=Amsterdam|pages=109–131|editor2-last=Sinnemäki|editor2-first=Kaius|editor3-last=Karlsson|editor3-first=Fred}}</ref> However, the use of Jawi is diminishing rapidly, being replaced by the [[Latin script]] introduced by the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] during the [[Dutch East Indies|colonial era]]. Today, the Jawi script are primarily used for religious and cultural activities.<ref>[http://exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg/aksara/3/gallery-3.html AKSARA-The Passage of Malay Scripts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408095128/http://exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg/aksara/3/gallery-3.html |date=8 April 2013 }}. Exhibitions.nlb.gov.sg. Retrieved 26 October 2010.</ref> Road signs and government buildings signs in the Riau Islands are also written in this script, usually written along the Latin script.

Most of the Chinese in the Riau Islands spoke a variety of [[Hokkien]], a local variant of the [[Min Nan]] [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese variety]], as most of the Riau Islands Chinese are of [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]] descent. The Riau Islands Hokkien is related to the Hokkien spoken in mainland Riau, such as the town of [[Bagansiapiapi]] and [[Selat Panjang]], as well as the Hokkien spoken in Central and Southern [[Peninsular Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. Together, they are known as the [[Southern Malaysia Hokkien]]. This dialect is based on the [[Quanzhou dialect]], which originated from the city of [[Quanzhou]] in [[Fujian]], [[China]]. It is markedly distinct from [[Penang Hokkien]] and [[Medan Hokkien]], which are based on [[Zhangzhou dialect]], another Hokkien dialect originated from the city of [[Zhangzhou]], also in Fujian. Other varieties of Chinese are also spoken in the province, such as [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]], [[Hainanese]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]] and [[Cantonese]], albeit to a lesser extent compared to Hokkien. Hokkien serves as the ''lingua franca'' of the Chinese people in the Riau Islands. Most of the Chinese varieties spoken in the region have been greatly influenced by [[Malay language|Malay]] and [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]], especially their [[List of Chinese loanwords in Indonesian|vocabulary]].

Other ethnic groups who migrated from other parts of Indonesia brought their own language, such as the [[Javanese language]] spoken by the [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau language]] spoken by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]] and different varieties of [[Batak languages|Batak]] spoken by different sub-groups of the [[Batak]] people.

[[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] is widely used as the national language. Most formal education, and nearly all national mass media, [[governance]], [[Public administration|administration]], [[judiciary]], and other forms of communication in the Riau Islands, are conducted in Indonesian. It is also used for inter-ethnic communication. Indonesian is spoken as the first language in major cities such as [[Batam]] and [[Tanjung Pinang]], while it is spoken as a second language elsewhere in the province. The [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese people]] in the Riau Islands use Indonesian as their third language, with Hokkien or other [[Varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] being used as their first language and the local Riau Malay as their second language. Due to it close proximity from [[Singapore]], [[English language|English]] or [[Singlish]] are sometimes used as another lingua franca among Riau Islands people to foreigners, especially in Batam.

The local Malay people of the Riau region since ancient times and even until the present-day is considered as a society that is accommodating, friendly, and welcome to immigrants who come to bring new cultures and religions, both from within and outside the country. The example are immigrants from [[India]] with [[Hinduism]], from China with [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]], from Europe with [[Christianity]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], as well as other migrants from various ethnic groups in the [[Nusantara (archipelago)|Nusantara]] archipelago.  Based on the composition of the population of the Riau Islands which is full of diversity with different socio-cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds, it is basically an asset for the Riau Archipelago itself. The religions embraced by the inhabitants of the province are very diverse, including [[Islam]], [[Protestantism]], [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Confucianism]].

As of 2016, [[Islam]] is the dominant religion in the province, forming 78.29% of the total population. [[Islam]] is generally adhered by the ethnic [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Banjar people|Banjars]], [[Bugis]], [[Sundanese people|Sundanese]] and some [[Batak]] sub-group. Islam has entered the region since at least the 12th century. Contact between the indigenous population and Muslim traders from the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Iran|Persia]] and India did occur for the first time in the northern Sumatra region because of its strategic position to traders stopover at that time. This condition strengthens the indication that the [[Islamization]] process is expected to have taken place since the contact took place so that a community was formed where the Arabs who settled in the village were married to local residents thus forming Muslim communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://media.neliti.com/media/publications/164474-ID-islamisasi-di-riau-kajian-sejarah-dan-bu.pdf|title=Islamization in Riau: Historical and Cultural Study of the entry and the development of Islam in Kuntu Kampar|last1=Roza|first1=Ellya|last2=Yasnel|access-date=1 October 2019}}</ref> Several Muslim organizations in Indonesia has branches in the Riau Islands, such as [[Muhammadiyah]] and the [[Nahdlatul Ulama]].

[[Christianity]] forms the second-largest religion group in the province, forming around 14.51% of the total population. The two largest Christian domination in the Riau Islands are [[Protestantism]] and [[Catholic Church|Catholicism]], forming around 11.97% and 2.54% of the total population respectively. Most of the people who adhered Protestantism are from [[Batak]] sub-groups (specifically [[Toba Batak people|Batak Toba]], [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]] and [[Simalungun people|Simalungun]]), [[Nias people|Nias]], [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]], and migrants from [[North Sulawesi]], [[Maluku Islands|Maluku]] and [[Western New Guinea|Papua]], while most of the people who adhered Catholicism are migrants from [[East Nusa Tenggara]]. The province does not have its own Catholic [[Diocese]]. Instead, it is served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Pangkal-Pinang]], which is based in [[Pangkal Pinang|Pangkal-Pinang]], [[Bangka Belitung Islands]].

[[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] forms a significant minority in the province, forming around 6.99% and 0.15% respectively. They are mostly adhered by the Chinese. Lastly, [[Hinduism]] only forms around 0.05% of the total population, which is mostly adhered by [[Balinese people|Balinese]] migrants and [[Indian Indonesians|Indonesians of Indian descent]].

== Culture ==
The culture of the Riau Islands is strongly influenced by the culture of the [[Malay culture|Malays]] and the Chinese people. Some ethnic groups, for example [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Balinese people|Balinese]], [[Bugis]], [[Batak]], and European culture also influenced the culture of the province. The culture of the Riau Islands is also influenced by the [[Islamic culture|culture of Islam]]. The Malay people that inhabits Riau Islands is also overwhelmingly adhered to Islam. In addition to Islam, the culture of the Riau Islands has also been influenced by the other religions, such as [[Buddhism]], Christianity and [[Confucianism]]. However, as the Riau Islands is considered as the home of the Malay people and part of the [[Malay world]], the culture of the Riau Islands mostly relate to the culture of the Malay people themselves.

What is typical of the Malay people is the designation of a nickname for a specific person in a family. The first child in a Malay family is called ''long'' or ''sulung'', the second child is called ''ngah''/''ongah'', the third child is called ''cik'' and the youngest child is called ''cu/ucu''. The nickname is usually followed by a word that describes the physical characteristics of the person concerned, for example ''cik'' ''itam,'' which means a third child with a dark/black characteristic. This culture can only be found in the Riau Malay community, both in the Riau Islands as well as mainland Riau.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ilmuseni.com/seni-budaya/kebudayaan-suku-melayu|title=Kebudayaan Suku Melayu yang Paling Fenomenal|last=Antono|first=Agil|date=28 December 2017|website=IlmuSeni.com|language=id|access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref>

A typical Riau Malay ''[[Kampong|kampung]]'' (village) are led by a village chief called the ''penghulu''. Presently, the ''penghulu'' is a village administrator chosen based on government regulations. Besides the ''penghulu'' there is also a leader in the religious sector called ''[[imam]]''. This ''imam'' takes care of all matters relating to religion, such as religious studies and lessons, marriage/ divorce/reconciliation, the distribution of inheritance, collection of [[zakat]] and others. Thus the ''penghulu'' accompanied by the ''imam'' are the leader of the ''kampung''.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last=Annisa|first=Pahlevi|title=Kebudayaan-melayu-riau |url=https://www.academia.edu/7535760 |website=Academia |language=id}}</ref>

In the ''kampung'', most of the local people knew each other, because the villagers had a strong sense of attachment to each other. Harmony is a characteristic of the community of these ''kampung''. The existence of harmony is not caused by external coercion in the form of harsh sanctions, but it does arise from a conscience that is influenced by the norms that live in the community. Starting from the movements, attitudes and traits are influenced by these factors. Avoiding things that can cause disgrace and shame is a motivating factor for continuing to act and be kind to others and such feelings are stronger than feelings of sin. All actions must be maintained so as not to cause "discordant eyes", "discordant ears", "discordant manners".<ref name=":2" />

=== Arts and performance ===
[[File:Joget-Dangkong.jpg|thumb|A troupe of local Riau Malay dancers performing the [[Joget]] Lambak. (taken in the late 19th century)]]
Various forms and types of arts found in the Riau region, namely theater, dance, music, singing, and literature. Artists in urban areas generally feel alien to traditional arts. Therefore, an appreciative link is needed by introducing all types and forms of traditional arts in urban areas. Thus, contemporary art that grows, lives, and develops in urban areas will have a solid and tidy foundation in contributing to national art.

In the late 1890s, the Rusydiah Club was founded, an association for scholars, writers, and cultural figures.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323835285|title=The Rushdiah Club: Its roles in Malay Societies, 1892–1940|last1=Zakariya|first1=Hafiz|last2=Oktasari|first2=Wiwin|date=29 December 2017|isbn=9789674186319}}</ref> This association was established in the Riau Islands, precisely on [[Penyengat Island]] which at that time was the center of the government of the [[Riau-Lingga Sultanate|Sultanate of Riau-Lingga]]. In essence, this association is a cultural institution that includes art, performance and literature. Its activities began with the commemoration of Islamic holidays, such as [[Mawlid|Maulud Nabi]], [[Isra and Mi'raj|Isra-Mikraj]], [[History of the Quran|Nuzulul Quran]], [[Eid al-Fitr]], [[Eid al-Adha]], and others which later developed to the publication of books by members of the association. All activities are supported by royal facilities in the form of the Marah Ahmadi Khanah Polar library and two [[Jawi alphabet|Jawi]] printing presses, namely Mathba‘at al Ahmadiyah and Mathba‘at al Riauwiyah.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/makam-merah-dan-alias-wello/|title=Makam Merah dan Alias Wello|last=dediarman|date=29 December 2016|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|publisher=Kemdikbud|access-date=2 October 2019}}</ref> The Rusydiah Klub is the first association of scholars in Indonesia. This association is not mentioned in national history, because of the lack of careful collection of historical material, or maybe because there is no input from those who know much about it. Rusydiah Club left behind a valuable heritage of creativity in the form of books of literature, religion, history and linguistics.<ref name=":2" />

[[File:Mak Yong Bintan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Mak Yong]] dancers in Bintan]]
The Riau region has long been an area of trade traffic in neighboring countries, so Riau has given birth to diverse cultural figures and colors. This is a burden, as well as a historical-geographical blessing. Riau seems to be a field of association of various artistic potentials, in which there are cultural influences in neighboring countries and other Indonesian cultures. Riau Malay art is very diverse, because small groups that exist in the community are also developing.<ref name=":2" /> The fact shows, the arts in Riau and the arts in Malay countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei Darussalam]] mutually complement and influence each other. Likewise, Malay cultural regions such as [[Sultanate of Deli|Deli]], [[Sultanate of Langkat|Langkat]], [[Serdang Malays|Serdang]] and [[Asahan Sultanate|Asahan]] in [[North Sumatra]], [[Jambi]], [[West Kalimantan]], and others, were also affected by the [[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]], [[Mandailing people|Mandailing]], [[Buginese people|Bugis]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]] cultures. Cultures influence that come from outside Indonesia such as [[India]] ([[Hindus|Hindu]]-[[Buddhism|Buddhist]]), [[Arabs|Arabic]] ([[Islam]]), [[Chinese culture|Chinese]], and [[Thai culture|Siamese]] influence. The flexibility of Malay culture is in line with the historical development and geographical location of Riau, making Riau very rich with a variety of artistic expressions. The development of Malay culture in Riau, in turn, can enrich national culture.<ref name=":2" />

''[[Baju Kurung]]'' is one of the traditional clothes of the Malay community in [[Brunei]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Singapore]], and [[southern Thailand]]. ''[[Baju Kurung]]'' is often associated with women. The hallmark of the clothes brackets is the loose design on the holes in the arms, abdomen, and chest. When worn, the bottom of the clothes bracket is parallel to the groin, but for rare cases there are also those that extend to knee level. Shirt brackets are not fitted with buttons, but are almost similar to t-shirts. Shirt brackets are also not collared, each end is crochet. Some parts are often decorated with gold embroidery. At first, the clothes of the brackets were usually worn for the great ceremony of Malay by women in the kingdom, used together with ''[[songket]]'' cloth to be used as a scabbard, various gold jewelry, and a small bag or fan. Since the majority of Malay communities embraced [[Islam]], many women who wear clothes in brackets match them with the [[hijab]], although there are also those who do not use them. Now the clothes of brackets are widely worn by ordinary people, used by children to read the [[Quran]], or ladies to go to the market, without including accessories that seem luxurious.

However, the main traditional dress of the people of the Riau Islands is the ''[[Kebaya]] Labuh'' and the ''Teluk Belanga.''<ref name=":5">{{Cite web|url=https://www.raparapa.co/pakaian-adat/|title=34 Pakaian Adat di Indonesia, Kekayaan yang Masih Dilestarikan|last=Raparapa|date=13 January 2017|website=Raparapa|access-date=17 April 2019|archive-date=17 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190417192935/https://www.raparapa.co/pakaian-adat/|url-status=dead}}</ref> The ''[[Kebaya]] Labuh a''re specifically worn by women. It is typically worn at the time of traditional ceremonies and official events of the local community. The hallmark of ''Kebaya Labuh'' and ''Teluk Belangga'' traditional clothing is the length of the kebaya to cover the knees with the shape of the kebaya looking wide and open. ''Kebaya Labuh'' is often combined with [[batik]] cloth such as cual fabric. For the wedding, the groom wore a head covering called ''[[Tengkolok|Tanjak]]''. The spindle is a rectangular [[songket]] that is folded into a headband. A distinctive feature of the ''Teluk Belanga'' custom clothing is a plain color paired with shades of color, a sheath worn over the knee that acts as a scarf, a headband made of songket cloth called the ''tanjak''. The custom attire of ''Kebaya Labuh'' and ''Teluk Belangga'' is complemented by a headdress called a peak which is a head covering made of square ''songket'' shaped like songkok or peci.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://bp-guide.id/AXOkKPew|title=9+ Ragam Baju Adat Sumatera Yang Keren dan Wajib Kamu Tahu (2018)|website=BP Guide – Temukan hadiah terbaikmu|language=id|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref> Typically, the skirt is only used for formal ceremonies or events such as feasts and custom ceremonies. However, these decorations are usually only worn on formal occasions such as death or marriage. Occasionally, ''Teluk Belangga'' clothing is usually accompanied by a ''[[Songkok|peci]]''. For women, the ''Kebaya Labuh'' is usually combined with batik and also with a scarf.

The ''[[Mak yong]]'' is one of the traditional dances that can be found in the Riau Islands. ''Mak Yong'' is a traditional theatrical art of the Malay community which is still sustainable today. Although it is not often performed, every service is always welcomed by enthusiastic residents, especially those who love Malay culture and native art. ''Mak Yong'' performances are usually performed by groups of dancers and musicians, who combine various religious elements, theatrical, dance, music, vocals and texts. The main characters are male and female, both are performed by female dancers. The ''Mak yong'' performance is accompanied by musical instruments such as fiddle and drums.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kepri-travel.kepriprov.go.id/item/makyong/|title=Makyong {{!}} Wonderful Kepri – Official Site|language=id-ID|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref> In the Riau Islands region, the ''Mak Yong'' oral tradition has been exhibited since several centuries ago and has spread to [[Bangka Island|Bangka]], Johor, [[Malacca]] and [[Penang]]. In the Riau Islands, this oral tradition developed rapidly during the sultanate era. ''Mak yong'' theater performing arts is played with dances, songs and jokes that are intertwined in a story line, the players are 20 people, women wearing glittering costumes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/ditwdb/makyong-kepulauan-riau-seni-pertujukkan/|title=Makyong Kepulauan Riau, Seni Pertujukkan|date=30 April 2019|website=Direktorat Warisan dan Diplomasi Budaya|language=id-ID|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref>

''[[Zapin]]'' is a Malay traditional dance that can be found in both the Riau Islands and mainland. This dance is one of several types of Malay dance that still exists today. According to history, in the beginning this dance was a dance of entertainment in the palace after being brought from [[Hadhramaut|Hadramaut]] in Yemen by Arab traders in the early 16th century. At that time the country of [[Johor]] became a substitute for the role of [[Malacca]] as an international port in the 16th century. This can be seen from the development of ''Zapin'' dance creations that are identical with Malay culture and in terms of rhyming. Artists and culture are able to make traditional art, not stopping but full of dynamics that are always acceptable in every circumstance. This traditional dance is both educational and entertaining, and is used as an Islamic [[Dawah|da'wah]] medium through ''Zapin'' songs that are sung. The accompanying music consists of fiddles, tambourines, drums and small drum percussion instruments called [[Mirwas|marwas]] or maracas. The ''Zapin'' dance focuses more on teamwork rather than individual efforts. Before the 1960s, ''Zapin'' was only performed by male dancers but now it is usually danced by female dancers or both male and female.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/tari-zapin/|title=Tari Zapin|last=dediarman|date=8 June 2014|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|publisher=Kemdikbud|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref>

The ''Malemang'' dance is a traditional Riau dance by the people of [[Bintan Island|Bintan]]. It originated back in the 12th century in Tanjungpisau. Originally, it was only performed at the Royal Palace of the Kingdom of Bentan in Bukit Batu, Bintan. As the kingdom collapsed, this dance became a folk entertainment show. At present, ''Malemang'' Dance is displayed in various events, including festivals. In the show, the dancers demonstrate their ability to take something (handkerchief, change, etc.). They do this by flexing (standing up, bending backwards). From this skill then this dance is called ''malemang'' or ''melemang''. In Tanjungpisau, this dance is better known as the ''Melemang Bintan Penaga'' Dance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogkulo.com/daftar-10-tarian-daerah-riau-kepri/|title=Daftar 10 Nama Tarian Daerah Riau & Kepulauan Riau untuk Anda Ketahui|date=25 May 2019|website=Blog Kulo|language=id-ID|access-date=4 October 2019|archive-date=22 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191022101357/https://blogkulo.com/daftar-10-tarian-daerah-riau-kepri/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Architecture===
[[File:TMII Riau Pavilion Malay House 02.jpg|thumb|A typical Malay traditional house in the [[Taman Mini Indonesia Indah]], Jakarta]]
In [[Malay culture]], the art of development also has characteristics that are reflected in the symbols of traditional houses that are full of meaning. At present, Malay traditional houses can still be found in several regions in the [[Riau Archipelago]], [[Peninsular Malaysia]], [[Brunei]] and other [[Malay world|Malay-populated countries]]. In traditional Malay society, a house is an intact building that can be used as a family residence, meeting place and shelter for anyone in need. Therefore, traditional Malay houses are generally large, usually with six poles, six porch poles and twelve poles or porch houses. Of the several forms of the house, all are almost identical, both stairs, doors, walls and room layout are identical. In addition to being large, the Malay house is also always in the form of a stage or a house with a hole, facing towards the sunrise. In general, the types of Malay houses include dwellings, halls, houses of worship and storage houses. The naming is adjusted to the function of each building.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gpswisataindonesia.info/2013/12/rumah-adat-riau-dan-kepulauan-riau/|title=Rumah Adat Riau dan Kepulauan Riau|access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref>

Riau Malay traditional house buildings are generally given a variety of decorations, starting from the door, window, ventilation to the top of the roof of the building, the decoration is adjusted to the meaning of each carving.  Additionally, these houses are also given a pattern. The pattern of a [[Riau Malays|Riau Malay]] house is largely derived from nature, consisting of flora, fauna, and space objects. These things are designed in certain forms, either in their original form such as backdrops, forest flowers, or in abstracted or modified forms so that they no longer appear in their original form, but simply use their name.

The ''Limas Potong'' house is one of the traditional houses of the Malays inhabiting the [[Riau Archipelago]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|url=https://situsbudaya.id/rumah-limas-potong-batam/|title=Rumah Limas Potong Batam|date=30 November 2017|website=Informasi Situs Budaya Indonesia|language=id-ID|access-date=3 October 2019}}</ref> ''Limas Potong'' is a stilt house, like a traditional house in [[Sumatra]] in general. Height of about 1.5 meters from the ground surface. The walls of the house are made of brown planks, while the roof is red zinc. The doors, windows and pillars on the front of the house are painted in white oil. ''Limas Potong'' has five main parts, namely terrace, front room, center, back (bed), and kitchen. The front of the house is used to display historical photographs of this traditional house, the living room contains a typical Malay bridal diorama, and the back is a room that contains a mosquito net that integrates with the kitchen.<ref name=":3" />

One of the most famous traditional house of the people of the Riau Islands is the ''Belah Bubung'' traditional house. This house is also known as the ''Rabung'' house or the ''Bumbung Melayu'' house. The name ''Belah Bubung'' was given by the Malays because the shape of the roof was split. The size of the house built is determined by the ability of its owner, the richer a person is, the bigger the house and the more variety of decoration. However, wealth is not an absolute determinant. The most important consideration in making a home is harmony with the owner. To determine whether or not a house is compatible, the owner calculates the size of the house by cubits, from one to five. The veins are: snake swimming, pursuing ripples, ripples climbing beetles shelter, debt out of debt changed debt, and five debt has not been affected. The best measure is if it is right on the count of ripples to climb the shade beetle.<ref name=":3" />

===Traditional weapon===
''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is a traditional weapon originating from the Riau Islands. ''[[Badik]]'' itself is a term for traditional weapons which is known among the Bugis community and some regions in [[Sumatra]]. Meanwhile, Tumbuk Lada is a traditional weapon of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay people]]. No wonder the ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' has similarities with weapons from other Malay-populated region. The Riau Islands are inhabited by various races and ethnicity. However, the majority of indigenous people are Malay people. Therefore, the culture of the Riau region has a lot in common with other indigenous Malay regions.  ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is a type of stabbing weapon measuring 27 to 29&nbsp;cm and its width is around 3.5 to 4&nbsp;cm. This weapon is not only used by the people of [[Jambi]], and also has similarities with the [[Buginese people|Buginese]] ''Badik'', it only differs in the shape and motive of the holster. Not only domestically, Malaysia also has the same traditional weapons, both in name and form. This is inseparable from the background of Malay communities spread throughout [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], [[Vietnam]] and along the Malay peninsula. Similar to the ''[[Kris|keris]]'', ''badik'' is also one of the identities that characterizes the Malay people. Until now the ''Badik Tumbuk Lado'' is still used by the people of the Riau islands to do production work such as farming or hunting. Some local customs also still maintain the ''badik'' as a complement to men's custom clothing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gpswisataindonesia.info/2014/09/senjata-tradisional-kepulauan-riau/|title=Senjata Tradisional Kepulauan Riau|access-date=4 October 2019}}</ref>

The ''Jenawi'' is a type of sword that became the most popular traditional weapon in the Riau area. This sword was often used by Malay warlords in the face of his enemies. The sword has a length of about 1 meter so it is often used for close combat. ''Jenawi'' sword is similar to a typical Japanese [[katana]]. Historians and cultural experts argue that this weapon originated from ancient Japan which experienced acculturation with Malay culture. Regardless of this opinion, the sword of genius remains a Malay people's identity on the national scene.

This gravy is a pork broth, with spices such as garlic and strong pepper.

Snacks and drinks such as the [[teh tarik]] and [[curry puff]] can also be found in the province. Teh Tarik is not originally an original beverage from the Riau Islands. This drink is familiar in [[Southeast Asia]] especially easily found in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]]. However, in the Riau Islands, such as [[Batam]], [[Tanjung Pinang]] and Tanjung Balai Karimun, this drink is commonly available everywhere. The condition of the Riau Islands, which is close to [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]] has made Teh Tarik to spread around the Riau Islands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpnbkepri/teh-tarik-ala-kepri/|title=Teh Tarik Ala Kepri|last=dediarman|date=20 December 2018|website=Balai Pelestarian Nilai Budaya Kepulauan Riau|publisher=Kemdikbud|access-date=21 January 2020}}</ref> Curry puff, also known as ''epok-epok'' in the local Riau Islands Malay, is a famous local snack that can be commonly found everywhere in the province.
