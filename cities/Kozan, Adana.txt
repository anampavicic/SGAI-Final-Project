The [[Kilgen River]], a tributary of the [[Ceyhan River|Ceyhan]], flows through Kozan and crosses the plain south into the Mediterranean. The [[Taurus Mountains]] rise up sharply behind the town.

Sis was the [[Historic capitals of Armenia|capital]] of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], today's [[Sis (ancient city)]], now called Kozan Kalesi, was built on a long rocky ridge in the center of the modern city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.castles.nl/sis-castle|title=Castles.nl - Sis Castle|website=www.castles.nl|access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref>

The population of the city has grown rapidly in recent years, from 15,159 in 1960, to 54,451 in 1990, to 72,463 in 2007 and to 74,521 in 2009 (census figures).

==Names==
The oldest known name is Sis or Siskia. Under the [[Roman Empire]], it was for a time named Flavias or Flaviopolis.<ref>[[1911 Encyclopædia Britannica]], ''s.v.'' [[s:1911 Encyclopædia Britannica/Sis|'Sis']]</ref> The Greek version of the older name, Σίσιον Sision, came back into use in the later Byzantine period.<ref>[[William Mitchell Ramsay]], ''The Historical Geography of Asia Minor'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=Y0sZAAAAYAAJ p. 385]</ref> In [[Armenian language|Armenian]], it is called Sis Սիս or '''Sissu'''.

''Kozan'' ({{langx|ota|قوزان|qōzān}}) was originally the name of the administrative division the town Sis was a part of. This name originates from the Qōzānoğlu dynasty of [[derebey]]s that controlled the region from 1689 to 1865.{{sfn|Gould|2012}}

==History==
===Middle Ages===
[[File:LANGLOIS(1861) p153 - VUE DE SIS.jpg|thumb|right|Panorama view of Sis (c.1855)]]
[[File:DAVIS(1879) p197 TOWN AND FORTRESS OF SIS.jpg|thumb|right|Panorama view of town and fortress (c.1870)]]

In 704, Sis was besieged by the [[Arabs]], but relieved by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]]. The [[Abbasid]] [[caliph]] [[al-Mutawakkil]] took it and refortified it, but it soon returned to Byzantine hands. It was rebuilt in 1186 by [[Leo II, Prince of Armenia|Leo II]], king of the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], one of the [[Rupenide]] dynasty who made the city the capital of the Kingdom of [[Lesser Armenia]] (from 1186 till 1375). During the [[Crusade]] the catholicate returned to Sis in 1294, and remained there 150 years.<ref name="eb1911">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Sis}}</ref>

In 1266 Sis, the capital of [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia|the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], was captured and damaged by the Egyptian Mamluks led by [[Baibars]]. [[al-Said Barakah]] sent [[Qalawun]] to attack the city in 1277, but in 1375, Sis was taken and demolished by the [[Ramadanids]], under the flag of the [[Mamluke]] Sultan of [[Egypt]]. The town never recovered its prosperity, not even when it passed into the power of the Ottomans in 1516.

===Ecclesiastical history===
{{more citations needed section|date=May 2020}}
Sis had an important place in ecclesiastical history both the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] and as a Roman Catholic [[titular see]]. It is first mentioned in [[Theodoret]]'s life of [[St. Simeon Stylites]].

In the Middle Ages, Sis was the religious center of Christian Armenians, until the Armenians moved the seat of Catholicos back to Vagharshapat ([[Echmiadzin]]), in [[Armenia]]. [[Lequien]] (II, 899) gives the names of several bishops of Sis, before and after Gregory IX.

Even prior to the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]], Sis was an episcopal see and several names of bishops and patriarchs can be found in the literature:

*[[Alexander of Jerusalem|Alexander]], later [[Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem|Bishop of Jerusalem]] and founder of the famous library of the Holy Sepulchre in the third century
*Nicetas, present at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325
*John, who lived in 451;
*Andrew in the sixth century
*George (681)
*Eustratus, [[Patriarch of Antioch]] about 868

In 1441, Sis having fallen from its high estate, the Armenian clergy proposed to remove the see, and on the refusal of the Catholicos of the day, [[Gregory IX of Cilicia|Gregory IX]], installed a rival, namely [[Kirakos I Virapetsi]] (Kirakos of Armenia) at [[Echmiadzin]], who, as soon as [[Selim I]] had conquered [[Kingdom of Armenia (Middle Ages)|Greater Armenia]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}, became the more widely accepted of the two by the Armenian church in the [[Ottoman Empire]].<ref name="eb1911"/>

The Catholicos of Sis (of the [[Holy See of Cilicia]]) maintained himself nevertheless, with under his jurisdiction several bishops, numerous villages and convents, {{citation needed span|and was supported in his views by the Catholic [[Pope]] up to the middle of the 19th century,|date=May 2020}} when the patriarch [[Nerses V of Armenia|Nerses]], declaring finally for Echmiadzin, carried the government with him.{{clarify|date=May 2020}} In 1885, Sis tried to declare Echmiadzin schismatic, and in 1895 its clergy took it on themselves to elect a Catholicos; but the Porte annulled the election, and only allowed it six years later upon Sis renouncing its pretensions to independence.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}} That Catholicos had the right to prepare the sacred myron (oil) and to preside over a [[synod]], but was in fact not more than a [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]], and regarded by many Armenians as schismatic.<ref name="eb1911"/>

===Ottoman period===
{{expand section|date=April 2015}}
In the Ottoman period, Kozan was in the [[sanjak]] of Adana, and the seat of the [[kaza]] of Kozan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.houshamadyan.org/en/mapottomanempire/vilayet-of-adana/sandjakofsis.html|title=Maps - Vilayet of Adana - Sandjak of Sis :: Houshamadyan - a project to reconstruct Ottoman Armenian town and village life|last=Houshamadyan|website=www.houshamadyan.org|access-date=21 April 2018}}</ref> Ottoman archives show that [[Devşirme]] system was implemented in Kozan. However there is evidence that the locals resisted the practise. In 1564, for example, villagers from Sis came to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] capital [[Istanbul]] and kidnapped their children back.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Yılmaz |first=Gülay |date=2015-12-01 |title=The Devshirme System and the Levied Children of Bursa in 1603-4 |url=https://belleten.gov.tr/doi/10.37879/belleten.2015.901 |journal=Belleten |language=tr |volume=79 |issue=286 |pages=901–930 |doi=10.37879/belleten.2015.901 |issn=0041-4255}}</ref> From 1689 to 1865,{{sfn|Gould|2012}} the region was under the control of Kozanoğulları, a family of feudal lords. While there are various theories about their history and origin,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Eberhard |first1=Wolfram |title=Nomads and Farmers in Southeastern Turkey, Problems of Settlement |date=1953 |publisher=Brill |page=45}}</ref> they claimed descent from Turkmen tribes,{{sfn|Bearman|Bianquis|Bosworth|van Donzel|2012}} and [[Ahmed Cevdet Pasha]] wrote that they were descended from the Arık tribe of Warsaks.{{sfn|Gould|2012}}

===Modern===

At the turn of the twentieth century, the town's population was 8,000, about 5,600 of which were Armenians.<ref>Kévorkian, Raymond H. and Paul B. Paboudjian, ''Les Arméniens dans l’Empire Ottoman à la veille du génocide''. Paris: Editions d’art et d’histoire, 1992, p. 292.</ref> They were all deported during the course of the [[Armenian genocide]]. Kozan was occupied by [[France]] between March 8, 1919 - June 2, 1920 during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. After Turkey was declared a republic, Kozan was a province, compromising the districts of Kozan, [[Kadirli]], [[Feke]] and [[Saimbeyli]] between 1923 and 1926.

==Kozan today==
Today Kozan is a city surrounded by vineyards, gardens and groves of [[Cupressaceae|cypress]], [[sycamore fig]], orange and lemon trees. In summer the great heat (40 plus degrees Celsius or 104 plus degrees Fahrenheit) compels the inhabitants to desert Kozan, retreating to cool off in the wooded higher ground.

==Climate==
Kozan has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Csa''). Kozan has mild, rainy winters and very hot, muggy and dry summers. The highest recorded temperature was on 13 August 2023 at {{convert|48.4|°C|1|abbr=on}}.{{citation needed|date=January 2024}}
