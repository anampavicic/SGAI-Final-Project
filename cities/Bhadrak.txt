'''Bhadrak''' is a city of [[Odisha]] state in eastern India.  The city is the district headquarters of [[Bhadrak district]]. According to legend, the city derives its name from the Goddess [[Bhadrakali]], whose temple is on the banks of the Salandi River.<ref name="BhadrakDistrictAbout">{{cite web |title=About District |url=https://bhadrak.nic.in/about-district/ |date=2018 |website=Bhadrak district |access-date=2 June 2018}}</ref>

==History==
According to legend, Bhadrak derives its name from the [[Bhadrakali|Goddess Bhadrakali]], whose temple is situated on the southwest outskirts of the town. It is an ancient land, dating from the age of the [[Puranas]].<ref name="BhadrakDistrictLocationOld">{{cite web |title=About the District |url=http://bhadrak.nic.in/location.htm |date=2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171021214056/http://bhadrak.nic.in/location.htm |archive-date=21 October 2017 |website=Bhadrak district |access-date=20 May 2018}}</ref>

Bhadrak's contribution to Odisha's maritime and agrarian prosperity, trade, and commerce throughout the ages is a part of history. In the Mughal period, Bhadrak was a [[subah]], or province, under the [[Nawabs of Bengal]]. When the imperial power of the Mughals waned, the area consisted of principalities such as Kanika, Nampo, and Agarapada, with administrative sub-units called chowparhies, all ruled by [[Kshatriya]] chiefs.<ref name="BhadrakDistrictLocationOld" />

After the occupation of Odisha by the British in June 1804, Bhadrak constituted one of the two administrative divisions of Cuttack and Balasore. In 1828, when Balasore was made a separate district, Bhadrak became one of its sub-divisions with an assistant magistrate and deputy collector as the sub-divisional head; but the [[Pargana|munsif]]'s court remained in [[Jajpur]] until 1901.<ref name="BhadrakDistrictLocationOld" />

Bhadrak was at the forefront during the period of national struggle. In 1920, Mahatma Gandhi's non-cooperation movement was launched. In March 1921, Gandhi visited Bhadrak, after being impressed by its nationalistic fervor and fighting spirit. In 1922, he started the rebellion of Kanika which British troops stationed at Bhadrak attempted to suppress; but ultimately the tenants' movement triumphed, under the leadership of Chakradhar Behera, the doyen of Kanika.<ref name="BhadrakDistrictLocationOld" />

When the civil disobedience movement was launched in 1930, Bhadrak became ardent with patriotic zeal, the salt law was defied, and success achieved against the government. [[Harekrushna Mahatab]]'s role in this success has become cherished in Bhadrak, and a part of the history of modern India. Gandhi, who visited Bhadrak again in 1934, staying in Mahatab's residence at Nuabazar, addressed a meeting of the Harizan workers in Jimbaran Ashram (Nuasahi, Ashram, Garadpur). It was during this time that Banchhanidhi Mohanty of Eram was by his patriotic songs shaping, stimulating, and sensitizing the national consciousness among the people.<ref name="BhadrakDistrictLocationOld" />

Since independence, the history of Bhadrak has been of progress in education, industry, agriculture, trade, and commerce.<ref name="BhadrakDistrictLocationOld" />
