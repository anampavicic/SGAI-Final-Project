Ayacucho is famous for its 33 churches, which represent one for each year of Jesus' life. Ayacucho has large religious celebrations, especially during the [[Holy Week]] of [[Easter]]. These celebrations include [[Horse racing|horse races]] featuring Peruvian [[Peruvian Paso|Caballos de Paso]] and the traditional running of the bulls, known locally as the ''jalatoro'' or ''pascuatoro''. The ''jalatoro'' is similar to the Spanish ''[[encierro]]'', except that the bulls are led by horses of the [[Morochuco]]s.{{cn|date=January 2023}}

==History==
Vestiges of human settlements more than 15,000 years old have been found at the site of [[Pikimachay]], about 25&nbsp;km north of Ayacucho. From 500 to 900, the region was occupied by the [[Wari culture]], which became known as the first expansionist empire based in the [[Andes]] before the [[Inca Empire]].

The [[Ayacucho region]] was inhabited by varying [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous cultures]] for thousands of years. During the Early Intermediate period (200 BC – 600 AD) the [[Nazca culture]] settled in the south-west, and the [[Huarpa culture|Warpa culture]] arose in the center of the Ayacucho region, the [[Wari Empire]] emerged as Huarpa cultures interacted with the nearby Nasca Culture at a time of intense interregional exchanges and widespread disruption to existing cultural traditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803121023895|title=Wari Empire}}</ref> During the Middle Horizon period (600 – 1000 AD), at its zenith the Wari state reigned over most of the highlands and coast of Peru, centered near the present-day city of Ayacucho (Huamanga), the Wari became the largest dominant culture in the Andes region before the Inca came into existence. The Wari civilization collapsed by about 1000 AD, and the capital [[Huari (archaeological site)|city of Wari]] was abandoned. With the end of the Wari culture, the Late Intermediate period (1000 AD – 1476 AD) is said to begin, while some post-Wari cultures continued to further develop during this era, particularly cultures from coastal Peru, the Late Intermediate era is marked by population decline and substantial cultural regression over extensive areas of the Peruvian highlands, the Ayacucho region became one of the most affected areas, urban planning ceased to be, people abandoned virtually all cities, if not all, and dispersed into rural hamlets.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcSsoJ0IXawC&pg=PA203|title = Agricultural and Pastoral Societies in Ancient and Classical History|isbn = 9781566398329|last1 = Adas|first1 = Michael|year = 2001}}</ref> New tribal cultures — well differentiated from the old Wari — arose in the Ayacucho region, over time these became a series of relatively powerful warlike chiefdoms that controlled region, according to colonial chroniclers these tribes were united into a confederacy by the time Inca began to expand, referred in the Spanish accounts as the "[[Chanka|Chanca confederacy]]", an alliance formed by the Chanca, Parinacocha, Vilca, Sora, and Rucana (Lucana) cultures, among other [[ayllu]] clans. After a series of fierce battles the Inca managed to defeat and conquer the Chanka confederacy and integrated the area into the Inca Empire, the Inca founded [[Vilcashuaman]] within Vilcas' culture territory, one of the most populous cities known to have existed in the Inca Empire,<ref name="books.google.com">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OFR6AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA188|title = Inca Culture at the Time of the Spanish Conquest|last1 = Rowe|first1 = John Howland|year = 1946}}</ref> capital of the Inca province ([[Government of the Inca Empire#Administrative divisions|wamani]]) of Vilcas.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFD-iAC-xKEC&pg=PA223|title = The Incas: New Perspectives|isbn = 9781851095742|last1 = McEwan|first1 = Gordon Francis|year = 2006}}</ref> Huamanga was another of the administrative centers in the region, founded at a place called Pocra.<ref name="books.google.com"/>

The Spanish colonial founding of Huamanga was led by conqueror [[Francisco Pizarro]] on April 25, 1540, who named it ''San Juan de la Frontera de Huamanga''.<ref>David Scott Palmer, "Ayacucho" in ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 1, p. 245. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.</ref> Due to the constant Incan rebellion led by [[Manco Inca Yupanqui]] against the Spanish in the zone, Pizarro was quick to populate the settlement with a small number of Spaniards brought from [[Lima]] and [[Cusco]]. On May 17, 1544, by Royal decree, Ayacucho was titled ''La Muy Noble y Leal Ciudad de Huamanga'' (the most noble and loyal city of Huamanga), the highest designation in the Spanish hierarchy of naming cities. The city's main University was founded on July 3, 1677, as [[San Cristóbal of Huamanga University]]. Ayacucho was significant in the colonial era for being an administrative center, a stopping-off point between Lima and Cuzco, and the residence of mercury miner from [[Huancavelica]], as well as local land owners.<ref name="Palmer, Ayacucho, p. 245">Palmer, "Ayacucho", p. 245.</ref>

On February 15, 1825, [[Simón Bolívar]] changed the city's name to ''Ayacucho'', renaming it after the historical [[Battle of Ayacucho]]. Upon seeing so many casualties on the battlefield, citizens called the area ''Ayakuchu'', ''aya'' meaning "dead" and ''kuchu'' meaning "corner" in [[Ayacucho Quechua]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} The [[Battle of Ayacucho]] was the last armed clash between the Spanish Army (formed mostly by Peruvian mestizos and indigenous peoples) and independentists  during the [[Peruvian War of Independence]], and the independents' victory ensured independence.<ref name="Palmer, Ayacucho, p. 245"/> The battle developed in the nearby [[pampas]] of La Quinua on December 9, 1824. Independentist forces were led by [[Antonio José de Sucre]], Simón Bolívar's lieutenant. Viceroy [[José de la Serna e Hinojosa]] was wounded, and after the battle second commander-in-chief [[José de Canterac]] signed the final capitulation of the Royalist army. The independent victory sealed the independence of Peru and South America. [[La Paz]], now the seat of government of [[Bolivia]], was similarly renamed ''La Paz de Ayacucho'' following this battle.

Although the city gained a new name and some fame, the economy declined following independence. There were attempts to revive the city's fortunes, with a planned railway link to Peru's network, but the line was terminated in Huancavelica.  A highway was subsequently constructed in 1968.<ref name="Palmer, Ayacucho, p. 245"/>  The city's economy is based on agriculture and light manufacturing, including textiles, pottery, leather goods, and filigree ware. It is a regional tourism destination, known for its 33 churches built in the colonial period, and for the nearby battlefield of La Quinua, where the Ayacucho battle was fought in 1824. The University of San Cristóbal was reopened in 1959. The city's population began to increase, but violent political unrest destabilized the region forced migration of many.<ref name="Palmer, Ayacucho, p. 245"/>

In 1980, the far-left terrorist organization known as the [[Shining Path]] (''Sendero Luminoso'') used Ayachucho as its base for its campaign against the Peruvian government, even staging an assault on the [[Assault of Ayacucho prison|Ayacucho prison]] in 1982. The campaign faded after the leader [[Abimael Guzmán]] Reynoso was captured in 1992 and put in prison. The region headed by Ayacucho is rural and one of the poorest of all the country.  With the peace of the last 15 years, the citizens work hard to improve the living conditions and attract jobs.

==Climate==
Owing to its high elevation, Ayacucho has a [[monsoon]]-influenced, cold [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''[[Cold semi-arid climate|BSk]]''). Aside from precipitation and from a thermal standpoint, the city has the [[subtropical highland climate|subtropical highland]] (''Cfb'') with uniform rainfall.
