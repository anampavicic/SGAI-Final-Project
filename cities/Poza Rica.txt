'''Poza Rica''' ({{IPA|es|ˈposa ˈrika}}), formally: '''Poza Rica de Hidalgo''' is a city and its surrounding municipality in the [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[List of states of Mexico|state]] of [[Veracruz]]. Its name means "rich well/pond". It is often thought that the name came to be because it was a place known for its abundance of oil. In reality, before oil was discovered, there existed a pond rich in fish, which gave origin to the city’s name. In the 20th century [[Veracruz#Golden_Lane_Oil_Fields|oil was discovered in the area]]. It has since been almost completely extracted. This has resulted in the decline of oil well exploration and drilling activities, though there are still many oil facilities. 

The city shares borders with the municipalities of [[Papantla]], [[Tihuatlán]], and [[Coatzintla]], and stands on [[Mexican Federal Highway|Federal Highway 180]]. The archaeological zone of [[El Tajín]] is located approximately {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} from Poza Rica. The area is tropical, with two beaches within one hour, [[Tuxpan]], and [[Tecolutla]], and one within 40 minutes east, Cazones. [[Mexico City]] is about {{convert|220|km|mi|sp=us}} from Poza Rica.Unlike most Mexican cities, it does not have old buildings because it is a new city founded officially on November 20, 1951. For that reason it has contemporary architecture with well-lined and designed streets with a modern look.

While the petroleum industry features heavily amongst the industrial landscape in Poza Rica, the city also has a wide variety of other industries with a large middle class.  As one of the largest and most populous cities in Veracruz, Poza Rica is an important industrial and commercial center, and a central hub for several road transportation lines. The city has recently seen much growth, with several shopping malls opening around the city. The city had an official population of 180,057 inhabitants and the municipality had 189,457 at the census of 2020.<ref name=CENSUSPOZARICA2020>[http://ceieg.veracruz.gob.mx/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2021/06/POZA-RICA_2021.pdf Censo Poza Rica 2020] CEEIG</ref> However, the Poza Rica [[metropolitan area]], which includes the municipalities of [[Cazones de Herrera]], [[Coatzintla]], [[Papantla]] and [[Tihuatlán]], showed a total population of 521,080.

==Main Attractions==
Poza Rica is close to the [[Costa Esmeralda]], the northern beaches of Veracruz, such as [[Tecolutla]], [[Tuxpan]], [[Cazones]] and [[Playa Esmeralda]]. 
The [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] of [[El Tajin]] is {{convert|15|km|mi|sp=us}} away.
The downtown area presents shopping opportunities.
It has a high viewing point called "El cerro del abuelo" where it's possible to see the whole city and its "quemadores", big petroleum burners which were used to light the city in the early years. A few of them remain.

The annual "Desfile del 18 de marzo" (March 18 Parade, "Petroleum Day") commemorates Mexican oil expropriation and has two parades, one in the morning and one in the afternoon. The city's populace is predominantly young. Though there are few expatriates, a few English-language schools employ teachers for locals and PEMEX employees.

== Geography ==
[[File:ZM de Poza Rica con nombres - copia.png|thumb|Map of Metropolitan Zone of the City.]]
The administrative boundaries of the municipality are determined by the municipality northeast of [[Papantla]], south to the town of [[Coatzintla]] and to the northwest by the municipality of [[Tihuatlán]], separated from the latter by the course of the [[river Cazones]].
    
=== Geology and relief ===

The center of the city sits in a small valley on the basin river Cazones, in the coastal plain of the [[Gulf of Mexico]], with an average altitude of 60 m, although most of the land sits on uneven ground and mostly hills northeast of the city, among which is the [[Cerro del Meson]], with a maximum height of 242 meters. The predominant soils are of the [[vertisol]] type, with a high content of [[clay]] forming expansive cracks in dry seasons.

Since its inception, the rapid urban growth in extension exceeded the capacity of available flat land in the city, expanding the urban area to the northeast of the city, using increasingly uneven ground and hills bordering the town of Papantla, inhabiting the slopes of the hills that surround the city center.

=== Hydrography ===
[[File:Rio Cazones.jpg|thumb|200px|Cazones River Sunrise on the banks of the city of Poza Rica]]
The town of Poza Rica is located in the watershed of the river Cazones, this River 100 [[km]] long born in the mountainous region of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] and flows into the [[Gulf of Mexico]], has a higher average annual runoff of 40 m<sup>3</sup>/s in its mouth. The city is also surrounded by several Cazones River tributary streams such as the [[Mollejón]], [[Hueleque]], Salsipuedes and [[Arroyo Corn]], which is regularly affected by flooding the annual rainy season.

Mexico's only nuclear power plant, [[Laguna Verde nuclear power plant]], is about {{convert|200|km|mi|sp=us}} away, near the state's capital city of [[Xalapa]], [[Veracruz]].
