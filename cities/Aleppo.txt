When the [[Suez Canal]] was inaugurated in 1869, much trade was diverted to sea and Aleppo began its slow decline. 

At the [[fall of the Ottoman Empire]] after [[World War I]], Aleppo lost its northern hinterland to modern [[Turkey]], as well as the important [[Baghdad Railway]] connecting it to [[Mosul]]. In the 1940s, it lost its main access to the sea, by [[Antakya]] and [[İskenderun]], also to Turkey. The growth in importance of Damascus in the past few decades further exacerbated the situation. This decline may have helped to preserve the old city of Aleppo, its medieval architecture and traditional heritage. It won the title of the Islamic Capital of Culture 2006 and has had a wave of successful restorations of its historic landmarks. The [[Battle of Aleppo (2012–2016)|battle of Aleppo]] occurred in the city during the [[Syrian Civil War]], and many parts of the city had suffered massive destruction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archnet.org/collections/54/sites/6414 |title=Collections – Aga Khan Collection – Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme – Aleppo Citadel Restoration |work=[[Archnet]] |access-date=13 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523070541/http://archnet.org/collections/54/sites/6414 |archive-date=23 May 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=2022-09-20 |title=The Destruction of Aleppo: The Impact of the Syrian War on a World Heritage City |url=https://www.getty.edu/part-2/10-bandarin/ |access-date=2022-10-12 |website=[[Cultural Heritage and Mass Atrocities]] |language=en }}{{Dead link|date=July 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Affected parts of the city are currently undergoing reconstruction.<ref name=":0">{{cite news |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/aleppo-rebuilds-itself-from-destruction-of-war-1.3267526 |title=Aleppo rebuilds itself from destruction of war |last=Jansen |first=Michael |newspaper=[[The Irish Times]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205093121/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/middle-east/aleppo-rebuilds-itself-from-destruction-of-war-1.3267526 |archive-date=5 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.trtworld.com/mea/aleppo-looks-to-rebuild-after-years-of-war-417651 |title=Aleppo looks to rebuild after years of war |last=Al Burai |first=Ahmed |website=[[TRT World]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171205143602/https://www.trtworld.com/mea/aleppo-looks-to-rebuild-after-years-of-war-417651 |archive-date=5 December 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> An estimated 31,000 people were killed in Aleppo during the conflict.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vdc-sy.info/index.php/en/martyrs/1/c29ydGJ5PWEua2lsbGVkX2RhdGV8c29ydGRpcj1ERVNDfGFwcHJvdmVkPXZpc2libGV8ZXh0cmFkaXNwbGF5PTB8cHJvdmluY2U9NnxzdGFydERhdGU9MjAxMi0wNy0xOXxlbmREYXRlPTIwMTYtMTItMjJ8 |title=Aleppo: Latest Killed |website=[[Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria]] |access-date=17 August 2020 |archive-date=5 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181205141059/http://www.vdc-sy.info/index.php/en/martyrs/1/c29ydGJ5PWEua2lsbGVkX2RhdGV8c29ydGRpcj1ERVNDfGFwcHJvdmVkPXZpc2libGV8ZXh0cmFkaXNwbGF5PTB8cHJvdmluY2U9NnxzdGFydERhdGU9MjAxMi0wNy0xOXxlbmREYXRlPTIwMTYtMTItMjJ8 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Etymology==
{{Hiero|1=ḫrb3 |2=<hiero>Aa1:D21-Z3-D58-G29-N25</hiero>|era=nk|align=left}}
Modern-day English-speakers commonly refer to the city as ''Aleppo''. It was known in antiquity as ''Khalpe'', ''Khalibon'', and to the [[ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[ancient Rome|Romans]] as ''Beroea'' ({{lang|grc|Βέροια}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/aleppo.html |title=Aleppo |publisher=[[World Heritage Site]] |access-date=11 March 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304011949/http://www.worldheritagesite.org/sites/aleppo.html |archive-date=4 March 2012}}</ref> During the [[Crusades]], and again during the [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon]] of 1923–1946, the name ''Alep'' was used. ''Aleppo'' represents the Italianised version of this.

The original ancient name, '''''Ḥalab''''', has survived as the current Arabic name of the city. It is of obscure origin. Some have proposed that ''Ḥalab'' means "iron" or "copper" in the [[Amorite language]] since the area served as a major source of these metals in antiquity.<ref>{{cite book |author=A.E.J. Morris |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nRBEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT1038 |title=History of Urban Form Before the Industrial Revolution |publisher=Routledge |year=2013 |page=1038 |isbn=978-1-317-88513-9 |access-date=16 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029010341/https://books.google.com/books?id=nRBEAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT1038 |archive-date=29 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Another possibility is that ''Ḥalab'' means 'white', as this is the word for 'white' in Aramaic.{{Citation needed|reason=The word for 'white' in Aramaic is 'Ḥwr', and not 'Ḥalab'|date=April 2021}} This may explain how ''Ḥalab'' became the Hebrew word for 'milk' or vice versa, as well as offering a possible explanation for the modern-day Arabic nickname of the city, '''al-Shahbāʾ''' ({{langx|ar|الشهباء}}), which means "the white-colored mixed with black" and allegedly derives from the white marble found at Aleppo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hadhramautnews.net/news-4451.htm |script-title=ar:حلب الشهباء..معناها وأهميتها عند النبي العربي إبراهيم الخليل |work=hadhramautnews.net |language=ar |access-date=19 January 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180706022148/http://www.hadhramautnews.net/news-4451.htm |archive-date=6 July 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

According to a [[folk etymology]] related by the twelfth century CE Rabbi [[Pethahiah of Regensburg]] and the traveler [[Ibn Battuta]], the name derives from {{langx|he|חלב|lit=milk}} or {{langx|ar|ḥaleb|lit=milk}} because [[Abraham]] milked his sheep there to feed the poor.<ref>{{cite book |author=Dan Ben Amos |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aMI4DzpymSIC&pg=PA283 |title=Folktales of the Jews, V. 3 (Tales from Arab Lands) |publisher=Jewish Publication Society |year=2011 |page=283 |isbn=978-0-8276-0871-9 |access-date=16 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029010329/https://books.google.com/books?id=aMI4DzpymSIC&pg=PA283 |archive-date=29 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

From the 11th century, it was common [[Rabbinic Judaism|Rabbinic]] usage to apply the term "[[Zobah|Aram-Zobah]]" to the area of Aleppo, and many [[Syrian Jews]] continue to do so.

Aleppo has scarcely been touched by archaeologists, since the modern city occupies its ancient site. The earliest occupation of the site was around 8,000 BC, as shown by excavations in Tallet Alsauda.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dailysabah.com/history/2015/12/07/meet-some-of-the-worlds-oldest-continually-inhabited-cities |title=Meet some of the world's oldest continually inhabited cities |website=[[Daily Sabah]] |date=7 December 2015 |access-date=9 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820032133/http://www.dailysabah.com/history/2015/12/07/meet-some-of-the-worlds-oldest-continually-inhabited-cities |archive-date=20 August 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Classical antiquity (Beroea) ===
[[File:TabulaPeutingeriana-berya.jpg|thumb|Beroea as it is shown in [[Tabula Peutingeriana]]]]
[[File:Brad Northern Basilica.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the [[Maronite]] basilica in [[Barad, Syria|Barad]]]]
[[Alexander the Great]] took over the city in 333 BC. [[Seleucus Nicator]] established a [[Hellenic Republic|Hellenic]] settlement in the site between 301 and 286 BC. He called it ''Beroea'' (Βέροια), after [[Veria|Beroea]] in [[Macedon]]; it is sometimes spelled as Beroia. Beroea is mentioned in [[1 Maccabees|1 Macc.]] 9:4.

Northern Syria was the center of gravity of the Hellenistic colonizing activity, and therefore of Hellenistic culture in the [[Seleucid Empire]]. As did other Hellenized cities of the Seleucid kingdom, Beroea probably enjoyed a measure of local autonomy, with a local civic assembly or ''[[Boule (ancient Greece)|boulē]]'' composed of free Hellenes.<ref name="Phenix, Robert R. 2008">Phenix, Robert R. (2008) ''The sermons on Joseph of [[Balai of Qenneshrin]]''</ref>

Beroea remained under Seleucid rule until 88 BC when Syria was conquered by the [[Armenian people|Armenian]] king [[Tigranes the Great]] and Beroea became part of the [[Kingdom of Armenia (antiquity)|Kingdom of Armenia]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Savory |first=R.

Rome's presence afforded relative stability in northern Syria for over three centuries. Although the province was administered by a [[legatus|legate]] from Rome, Rome did not impose its administrative organization on the Greek-speaking ruling class or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] speaking populace.<ref name="Phenix, Robert R. 2008"/>

The Roman era saw an increase in the population of northern Syria that accelerated under the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] well into the 5th century. In [[Late Antiquity]], Beroea was the second largest Syrian city after [[Antioch]], the capital of [[Roman Syria]] and the third largest city in the Roman world. Archaeological evidence indicates a high population density for settlements between Antioch and Beroea right up to the 6th century. This agrarian landscape still holds the remains of large estate houses and churches such as the [[Church of Saint Simeon Stylites]].<ref name="Phenix, Robert R. 2008"/>

===Ecclesiastical history===
[[File:Aleppo Citadel 10 - Mosque of Abraham.jpg|thumb|The Mosque of Abraham in the Citadel of Aleppo, originally built by the Byzantines as a church]]
The names of several bishops of the [[episcopal see]] of Beroea, which was in the [[Roman province]] of [[Syria Prima]], are recorded in extant documents. The first whose name survives is that of Saint [[Eustathius of Antioch]], who, after being bishop of Beroea, was transferred to the important [[metropolitan see]] of [[Patriarch of Antioch|Antioch]] shortly before the 325 [[First Council of Nicaea]]. His successor in Beroea Cyrus was for his fidelity to the Nicene faith sent into exile by the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Constantius II]]. After the [[Council of Seleucia]] of 359, called by Constantius, [[Meletius of Antioch]] was transferred from [[Sivas|Sebastea]] to Beroea but in the following year was promoted to Antioch. His successor in Beroea, Anatolius, was at a council in Antioch in 363. Under the persecuting Emperor [[Valens]], the bishop of Beroea was Theodotus, a friend of [[Basil the Great]]. He was succeeded by [[Acacius of Beroea]], who governed the see for over 50 years and was at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381 and the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431. In 438, he was succeeded by Theoctistus, who participated in the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451 and was a signatory of the joint letter that the bishops of the province of Syria Prima sent in 458 to Emperor [[Leo I the Thracian]] about the murder of [[Proterius of Alexandria]]. In 518, Emperor [[Justin I]] exiled the bishop of Beroea Antoninus for rejecting the Council of Chalcedon. The last known bishop of the see is Megas, who was at a synod called by [[Patriarch Menas of Constantinople]] in 536.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_86weAemI-e4C ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171010052512/https://books.google.com/books?id=86weAemI-e4C |date=10 October 2017 }}, Paris 1740, Vol. II, coll. 781–786</ref><ref>Raymond Janin, v.

It later became part of [[Jund Qinnasrin]] under the [[Umayyad Caliphate]]. In 944, it became the seat of an independent Emirate under the [[Hamdanid]] prince [[Sayf al-Dawla]], and enjoyed a period of great prosperity, being home to the great poet [[al-Mutanabbi]] and the philosopher and [[polymath]] [[al-Farabi]].{{sfn|Burns|2016|pp=90–92}} In 962, the city was [[Sack of Aleppo (962)|sacked]] by the Byzantine general [[Nikephoros II Phokas|Nikephoros Phokas]].{{sfn|Burns|2016|pp=92–93}} Subsequently, the city and its emirate [[Treaty of Safar|became a temporary vassal]] of the Byzantine Empire.

Mirdasid rule was marked by internal squabbles between different Mirdasid chieftains that sapped the emirate's power and made it susceptible to external intervention by the Byzantines, Fatimids, [[Uqaylids]], and [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turkoman]] warrior bands.{{sfn|Bianquis|1993|pp=116–122}}

====Seljuq and Ayyubid periods====
In late 1077, Seljuk emir [[Tutush I]] launched a campaign to capture Aleppo during the reign of [[Sabiq ibn Mahmud]] of the [[Mirdasid dynasty]], which lasted until 1080, when his reinforcements were ambushed and routed by a coalition of Arab tribesmen led by [[Banu Kilab|Kilabi]] chief Abu Za'ida at [[Wadi Butnan]].{{sfn|Zakkar|1969|p=202}} After the death of [[Muslim ibn Quraysh|Sharaf al-Dawla]] of the [[Uqaylid dynasty]] in June 1085, the headman in Aleppo [[Sharif]] Hassan ibn Hibat Allah Al-Hutayti promised to surrender the city to Sultan [[Malik-Shah I]]. When the latter delayed his arrival, Hassan contacted the Sultan's brother Tutush. However, after Tutush defeated [[Suleiman ibn Qutalmish|Suleiman ibn Qutulmish]], who had intended to take Aleppo for himself, in the [[battle of Ain Salm]], Hassan went back on his commitment. In response, Tutush attacked the city and managed to get hold of parts of the walls and towers in July 1086, but he left in September, either due to the advance of Malik-Shah or because the Fatimids were besieging Damascus.{{sfn|Basan|2010|p=91}}{{sfn|Beihammer|2017|p=247}} In 1087, [[Aq Sunqur al-Hajib]] became the Seljuk governor of Aleppo under Sultan Malik Shah I.<ref name="Kamāl">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZV-6AAAAIAAJ |title=Zubdat al-ḥalab min tārīkh Ḥalab |author=Kamāl al-Dīn ʻUmar ibn Aḥmad Ibn al-ʻAdīm |year=1996 |access-date=15 February 2021 |archive-date=23 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230923074247/https://books.google.com/books?id=ZV-6AAAAIAAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> During his bid for the Seljuk throne, Tutush had Aq Sunqur executed and after Tutush died in battle, the town was ruled by his son [[Fakhr al-Mulk Ridwan|Ridwan]].{{sfn|Basan|2010|p=99, 101}}{{sfn|Beihammer|2017|p=252,254}}

In 1128, Aleppo became capital of the expanding [[Zengid dynasty]], which ultimately conquered Damascus in 1154. In 1138, Byzantine emperor [[John II Komnenos]] led a campaign, which main objective was to capture the city of Aleppo. On 20 April 1138, the Christian army including Crusaders from [[Principality of Antioch|Antioch]] and [[County of Edessa|Edessa]] launched an [[Siege of Aleppo (1138)|attack on the city]] but found it too strongly defended, hence John II moved the army southward to take nearby fortresses.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=215}} On 11 October 1138, [[1138 Aleppo earthquake|a deadly earthquake]] ravaged the city and the surrounding area.

In 1183, Aleppo came under the control of [[Saladin]] and then the [[Ayyubid dynasty]]. When the Ayyubids were toppled in Egypt by the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluks]], the Ayyubid emir of Aleppo [[An-Nasir Yusuf]] became sultan of the remaining part of the Ayyubid Empire.

In September 1260, the Egyptian Mamluks negotiated for a treaty with the Franks of Acre which allowed them to pass through Crusader territory unmolested, and engaged the Mongols at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]] on 3 September 1260. The Mamluks won a decisive victory, killing the Mongols' Nestorian Christian general [[Kitbuqa]], and five days later they had retaken Damascus. Aleppo was recovered by the Muslims within a month, and a Mamluk governor placed to govern the city. Hulagu sent troops to try to recover Aleppo in December. They were able to massacre a large number of Muslims in retaliation for the death of Kitbuqa, but after a fortnight could make no other progress and had to retreat.{{sfn|Runciman|1987|p=314}}

[[File:Al-Atroush Mosque, Aleppo.jpg|thumb|[[Al-Otrush Mosque]] of the Mamluk period]]
The Mamluk governor of the city became insubordinate to the central Mamluk authority in Cairo, and in Autumn 1261 the Mamluk leader [[Baibars]] sent an army to reclaim the city. In October 1271, the Mongols led by general [[Samagar]] took the city again, attacking with 10,000 horsemen from [[Anatolia]], and defeating the [[Turkoman (ethnonym)|Turcoman]] troops who were defending Aleppo. The Mamluk garrisons fled to [[Hama]], until Baibars came north again with his main army, and the Mongols retreated.{{sfn|Runciman|1987|pp=336–337}}

On 20 October 1280, the Mongols took the city again, pillaging the markets and burning the mosques.{{sfn|Burns|2016|p=179}} The Muslim inhabitants fled for Damascus, where the Mamluk leader [[Qalawun]] assembled his forces. When his army advanced following the [[Second Battle of Homs]] in October 1281, the Mongols again retreated, back across the [[Euphrates]]. In October 1299, [[Ghazan]] captured the city, joined by his vassal Armenian King [[Hethum II, King of Armenia|Hethum II]], whose forces included some [[Knights Templar|Templars]] and [[Knights Hospitaller|Hospitallers]].{{sfn|Demurger|2007|p=142}}

In 1400, the Mongol-Turkic leader [[Timur|Tamerlane]] [[Sack of Aleppo (1400)|captured the city]] again from the Mamluks.{{sfn|Runciman|1987|p=463}} He massacred many of the inhabitants, ordering the building of a tower of 20,000 skulls outside the city.<ref>[http://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Battle%20of%20Aleppo Battle of Aleppo@Everything2.com<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117131348/https://everything2.com/index.pl?node=Battle%20of%20Aleppo |date=17 January 2018 }}.</ref> After the withdrawal of the Mongols, all the Muslim population returned to Aleppo. On the other hand, Christians who left the city during the Mongol invasion, were unable to resettle back in their own quarter in the old town, a fact that led them to establish a new neighbourhood in 1420, built at the northern suburbs of Aleppo outside the city walls, to become known as ''[[Al-Jdayde|al-Jdeydeh]]'' quarter ("new district" {{langx|ar|جديدة|link=no}}).

Aleppo became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1516 as part of the vast expansion of the Ottoman borders during the reign of [[Selim I]]. The city then had around 50,000 inhabitants, or 11,224 households according to an Ottoman census.<ref>"Population and Revenue in the Towns of Palestine in the Sixteenth Century"</ref> In 1517, Selim I obtained a fatwa from Sunnite religious leaders and unleashed violence on the [[Alawites]], killing 9,400 men, which is known as the [[Massacre of the Telal]].<ref>{{cite web |date=9 May 2017 |title=Ottoman Empire massacre against Alawites |url=http://sy-center.net/?p=1512 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190423182731/http://sy-center.net/?p=1512 |archive-date=23 April 2019 |access-date=28 May 2018 |work=Syrian Center for Studies}}</ref> It was the centre of the [[Aleppo Eyalet]]; the rest of what later became Syria was part of either the eyalets of Damascus, Tripoli, Sidon or Raqqa.

Moreover, thanks to its strategic geographic location on the trade route between [[Anatolia]] and the east, Aleppo rose to high prominence in the Ottoman era, at one point being second only to [[Constantinople]] in the empire. By the middle of the 16th century, Aleppo had displaced [[Damascus]] as the principal market for goods coming to the Mediterranean region from the east. This is reflected by the fact that the [[Levant Company of London]], a joint-trading company founded in 1581 to monopolize England's trade with the Ottoman Empire, never attempted to settle a factor, or agent, in Damascus, despite having had permission to do so. Aleppo served as the company's headquarters until the late 18th century.<ref name="Masters 2009">Ágoston and Masters (2009), Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire</ref>

However, the prosperity Aleppo experienced in the 16th and 17th century started to fade as silk production in Iran went into decline with the fall of the [[Safavid dynasty]] in 1722. By mid-century, caravans were no longer bringing silk from Iran to Aleppo, and local Syrian production was insufficient for Europe's demand. European merchants left Aleppo and the city went into an economic decline that was not reversed until the mid-19th century when locally produced cotton and tobacco became the principal commodities of interest to the Europeans.<ref name="Masters 2009"/> According to [[Halil İnalcık]], "Aleppo ... underwent its worst catastrophe with the wholesale destruction of its villages by [[Bedouin]] raiding in the later years of the century, creating a long-running [[famine]] which by 1798 killed half of its inhabitants."<ref>Suraiya Faroqhi, Halil İnalcık, Donald Quataert (1997).

The economy of Aleppo was badly hit by the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869.

The witches torment the captain of the ship the ''Tiger'', which was headed to Aleppo from England and endured a 567-day voyage before returning unsuccessfully to port. Reference is also made to the city in Shakespeare's ''Othello'' when Othello speaks his final words (ACT V, ii, 349f.): "Set you down this/And say besides that in Aleppo once,/Where a malignant and a turbanned Turk/Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,/I took by th' throat the circumcised dog/And smote him—thus!"

The Arab residents in the province (as well as the Kurds) supported the Turks in this war against the French, including the leader of the [[Hananu Revolt]], [[Ibrahim Hananu]], who directly coordinated with Atatürk and received weaponry from him. The outcome, however, was disastrous for Aleppo, because as per the [[Treaty of Lausanne]], most of the Province of Aleppo was made part of Turkey with the exception of Aleppo and [[Alexandretta]];<ref name="atak5">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ttYVBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT149 |publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-8041-5347-8 |title=Eastward to Tartary |author=Robert D.

Moreover, the [[Sykes-Picot]] division of the Near East separated Aleppo from most of [[Mesopotamia]], which also harmed the economy of Aleppo.

[[File:General Gouraud marching in Aleppo.jpg|thumb|left|General [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Gouraud]] crossing through al-Khandaq street on 13 September 1920]]
The [[State of Aleppo]] was declared by French General [[Henri Gouraud (French Army officer)|Henri Gouraud]] in September 1920 as part of a French plan to make Syria easier to administer by dividing it into several smaller states. France became more concerned about the idea of a united Syria after the [[Battle of Maysaloun]].

By separating Aleppo from Damascus, Gouraud wanted to capitalize on a traditional state of competition between the two cities and turn it into political division. The people in Aleppo were unhappy with the fact that Damascus was chosen as capital for the new nation of Syria. Gouraud sensed this sentiment and tried to address it by making Aleppo the capital of a large and wealthier state with which it would have been hard for Damascus to compete. The State of Aleppo as drawn by France contained most of the fertile area of Syria: the fertile countryside of Aleppo in addition to the entire fertile basin of river [[Euphrates]]. The state also had access to sea via the autonomous [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]]. On the other hand, Damascus, which is basically an oasis on the fringes of the [[Syrian Desert]], had neither enough fertile land nor access to sea. Basically, Gouraud wanted to satisfy Aleppo by giving it control over most of the agricultural and mineral wealth of Syria so that it would never want to unite with Damascus again.<ref name="M.

[[File:Aleppo Grand Seray.jpg|thumb|[[Grand Serail of Aleppo|Grand Serail d'Alep]], originally planned to become the seat of the government of the short-lived [[State of Aleppo]]]]
The limited economic resources of the Syrian states made the option of completely independent states undesirable for France, because it threatened an opposite result: the states collapsing and being forced back into unity. This was why France proposed the idea of a Syrian federation that was realized in 1923. Initially, Gouraud envisioned the federation as encompassing all the states, even Lebanon. In the end however, only three states participated: Aleppo, [[State of Damascus|Damascus]], and the [[Alawite State]]. The capital of the federation was Aleppo at first, but it was relocated to Damascus. The president of the federation was [[Subhi Barakat]], an [[Antioch]]-born politician from Aleppo.
[[File:Quweik flood Aleppo.jpg|The Queiq River flood of 6 February 1922|200px|thumb]]

The federation ended in December 1924, when France merged Aleppo and Damascus into a single Syrian State and separated the Alawite State again. This action came after the federation decided to merge the three federated states into one and to take steps encouraging Syria's financial independence, steps which France viewed as too much.<ref name="M.

When the [[Great Syrian Revolt|Syrian Revolt]] erupted in southern Syria in 1925, the French held in Aleppo State new elections that were supposed to lead to the breaking of the union with Damascus and restore the independence of Aleppo State. The French were driven to believe by pro-French Aleppine politicians that the people in Aleppo were supportive of such a scheme. After the new council was elected, however, it surprisingly voted to keep the union with Damascus. [[Syrian National Block|Syrian nationalists]] had waged a massive anti-secession public campaign that vigorously mobilized the people against the secession plan, thus leaving the pro-French politicians no choice but to support the union. The result was a big embarrassment for France, which wanted the secession of Aleppo to be a punitive measure against Damascus, which had participated in the Syrian Revolt, however, the result was respected.

The first [[coup d'état]] in modern Syrian history was carried out in March 1949 by an army officer from Aleppo, [[Hussni Zaim]]. However, lured by the absolute power he enjoyed as a dictator, Zaim soon developed a pro-Egyptian, pro-Western orientation and abandoned the cause of union with Iraq.

Soon after Shishakly's domination ended in 1954, a [[United Arab Republic|union]] with Egypt under [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] was implemented in 1958. The union, however, collapsed three and a half years later when a junta of young Damascene officers carried out a separatist coup. Aleppo resisted the separatist coup, but eventually it had no choice but to recognize the new government.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iIy5CgAAQBAJ&q=nawaf+ghazaleh&pg=PT606 |title=Understanding the Volatile and Dangerous Middle East: A Comprehensive Analysis |isbn=9781491766583 |last1=Carol |first1=Steven |date=25 August 2015 |publisher=iUniverse |access-date=7 July 2022 |archive-date=23 September 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230923074826/https://books.google.com/books?id=iIy5CgAAQBAJ&q=nawaf+ghazaleh&pg=PT606 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 1963 a coalition of [[Baathist]]s, [[Nasserist]]s, and Socialists launched a new coup whose declared objective was to restore the union with Egypt. However, the new government only restored the flag of the union. Soon thereafter disagreement between the Baathists and the Nasserists over the restoration of the union became a crisis, and the Baathists ousted the Nasserists from power. The Nasserists, most of whom were from the Aleppine middle class, responded with an insurgency in Aleppo in July 1963.

Again, the Ba'ath government tried to absorb the dissent of the Syrian middle class (whose center of political activism was Aleppo) by putting to the front [[Amin al-Hafiz]], a Baathist military officer from Aleppo.<ref>{{cite news |title=Amin al-Hafez obituary |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/feb/16/syria |work=The Guardian |access-date=31 May 2012 |agency=Associated Press |date=16 February 2010 |location=London |archive-date=9 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909123147/http://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2010/feb/16/syria |url-status=live }}</ref>

President [[Hafez al-Assad]], who came to power in 1970, relied on support from the business class in Damascus.<ref>Seale, Patrick (1990) Asad: The Struggle for the Middle East</ref> This gave Damascus further advantage over Aleppo, and hence Damascus came to dominate the Syrian economy.

A stalemate that had been in place for four years ended in July 2016, when Syrian Army troops closed the last supply line of the rebels into Aleppo with the support of Russian airstrikes. In response, rebel forces launched unsuccessful counter-offensives in September and October that failed to break the siege; in November, government forces embarked on a decisive campaign. The rebels agreed to evacuate from their remaining areas in December 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sim |first=David |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/fall-aleppo-timeline-how-assad-captured-syrias-biggest-city-1596504 |title=The fall of Aleppo timeline: How Assad captured Syria's biggest city |work=IB Times |date=16 December 2016 |access-date=26 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190212094836/https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/fall-aleppo-timeline-how-assad-captured-syrias-biggest-city-1596504 |archive-date=12 February 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Syrian government victory with Russian aerial bombardment was widely seen as a potential turning point in Syria's civil war.<ref>{{cite news |last=Aron |first=Lund |url=http://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/66314 |title=A Turning Point in Aleppo |work=Carnegie Middle East Center |date=2016-12-15 |access-date=2016-12-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181213094844/http://carnegie-mec.org/diwan/66314 |archive-date=13 December 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/syrias-long-brutal-civil-war-may-be-reaching-a-turning-point/ |title=Syria's long, brutal civil war may be reaching turning point |website=[[CBS News]] |date=4 December 2016 |access-date=26 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502003252/https://www.cbsnews.com/news/syrias-long-brutal-civil-war-may-be-reaching-a-turning-point/ |archive-date=2 May 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:تلال جبل حلب.JPG|thumb|left|The nearby [[Kurd Mountains]] at the northwest of Aleppo]]
Aleppo lies about {{cvt|120|km|0}} inland from the [[Mediterranean Sea]], on a [[Aleppo plateau|plateau]] {{cvt|380|m}} above sea level, {{cvt|45|km}} east of the Syrian-Turkish border [[Bab al-Hawa Border Crossing|checkpoint of Bab al-Hawa]]. The city is surrounded by farmlands from the north and the west, widely cultivated with olive and [[pistachio]] trees. To the east, Aleppo approaches the dry areas of the [[Syrian Desert]].
[[File:Downtown Aleppo, Queik river at night.jpg|thumb|[[Queiq River]]]]
The city was founded a few kilometres south of the location of the current old city, on the right bank of [[Queiq River]] which arises from the [[Aintab plateau]] in the north and runs through Aleppo southward to the fertile country of [[Qinnasrin]]. The old city of Aleppo lies on the left bank of the Queiq. It was surrounded by a circle of eight hills surrounding a prominent central hill on which the castle (originally a temple dating to the 2nd millennium BC) was erected. The radius of the circle is about {{cvt|10|km}}. The hills are Tell as-Sawda, Tell ʕāysha, Tell as-Sett, Tell al-Yāsmīn (Al-ʕaqaba), Tell al-Ansāri (Yārūqiyya), ʕan at-Tall, al-Jallūm, Baḥsīta.<ref name="Duden6">{{cite book |editor=Alexander Russell |title=The Natural History of Aleppo |edition=1st |year=1856 |publisher=Unknown |location=London |page=266}}</ref> The old city was enclosed within an ancient wall that was last rebuilt by the [[Mamluk]]s. The wall has since disappeared. It had nine gates and was surrounded by a broad deep ditch.<ref name="Duden6"/>

Occupying an area of more than {{cvt|190|km²}}, Aleppo is one of the fastest-growing cities in the Middle East. According to the new major plan of the city adopted in 2001, it is envisaged to increase the total area of Aleppo up to {{cvt|420|km²}} by the end of 2015.<ref name="Syr-news1">Syria News [http://www.syria-news.com/readnews.php?sy_seq=99523 statement by Syrian Minister of Local Administration, Syria (Arabic, August 2009)] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304055701/http://www.syria-news.com/readnews.php?sy_seq=99523 |date=4 March 2012 }}</ref><ref name="Aleppo plan"/>

===Climate===
Aleppo has a [[cold semi-arid climate|cool steppe climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''BSk''). The mountain series that run along the Mediterranean coast, namely the [[Syrian Coastal Mountain Range|Alawiyin Mountains]] and the [[Nur Mountains]], largely block the effects of the Mediterranean on climate ([[rain shadow effect]]). The average high and low temperature throughout the year is {{cvt|23.8|and|11.1|°C|°F}}. The average precipitation is {{cvt|329.4|mm|2}}. More than 80% of precipitation occurs between October and March. It snows once or twice every winter. Average humidity is 55.7%.<ref name=klimatafel>{{cite web |url=http://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_400070_kt.pdf |title=Klimatafel von Aleppo (Halab) / Syrien |publisher=Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure |access-date=13 December 2016 |archive-date=19 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819004952/https://www.dwd.de/DWD/klima/beratung/ak/ak_400070_kt.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Architecture===
[[File:Citadel of Aleppo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|[[Citadel of Aleppo|Aleppo Citadel]]]]
Aleppo is characterized with mixed architectural styles, having been ruled by, among others, Romans, Byzantines, Seljuqs, Mamluks and Ottomans.<ref>{{cite news |last=Yacoub |first=Khaled |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE66F1ED20100716 |title=Travel Postcard: 48 hours in Aleppo, Syria |work=Reuters |date=16 July 2010 |access-date=11 March 2012 |archive-date=30 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211230154929/https://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE66F1ED20100716 |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[File:Villa Rose, Aleppo.jpg|thumb|right|[[Villa Rose]], built in 1928 during the period of the French mandate]]
Various types of 13th and 14th centuries constructions, such as caravanserais, caeserias, Quranic schools, hammams and religious buildings are found in the [[Old City of Aleppo|old city]]. The quarters of [[al-Jdayde]] district are home to numerous 16th and 17th-century houses of the Aleppine bourgeoisie, featuring stone engravings. [[Baroque architecture]] of the 19th and early 20th centuries is common in al-Azizyah district, including the [[Villa Rose]]. The new Shahbaa district is a mixture of several styles, such as [[Neo-classical architecture|Neo-classic]], [[Norman Architecture|Norman]], Oriental and even [[Chinese architecture]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.middleeast.com/aleppo.htm |title=Aleppo |publisher=Middleeast.com |access-date=11 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316160211/http://www.middleeast.com/aleppo.htm |archive-date=16 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Since the old city is characterized with its large mansions, narrow alleys and covered souqs, the modern city's architecture has replenished the town with wide roads and large squares such as the [[Saadallah Al-Jabiri Square]], the [[Liberty Square (Aleppo)|Liberty Square]], the President's Square and [[Sabaa Bahrat Square (Aleppo)|Sabaa Bahrat Square]]
[[File:Aleppo throne hall.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Throne hall of the citadel]]
[[File:Aleppo Cittadella - GAR - 9-22.JPG|thumb|[[Citadel of Aleppo|Aleppo Citadel]], roof of the baths, with the mosque and minaret in the background]]
There is a relatively clear division between old and new Aleppo. The older portions of the city, with an approximate area of {{cvt|160|ha|sqmi|1}} are contained within a wall, {{cvt|5|km}} in circuit with nine gates. The huge medieval [[castle]] in the city — known as the [[Citadel of Aleppo]] — occupies the center of the ancient part, in the shape of an [[acropolis]].

Being subjected to constant invasions and political instability, the inhabitants of the city were forced to build cell-like quarters and districts that were socially and economically independent. Each district was characterized by the religious and ethnic characteristics of its inhabitants.

The mainly white-stoned old town was built within the historical walls of the city, pierced by the nine historical gates, while the newer quarters of the old city were first built by the Christians during the early 15th century in the northern suburbs of the ancient city, after the Mongol withdrawal from Aleppo. The new quarter known as [[al-Jdayde]] is one of the finest examples of a cell-like quarter in Aleppo. After [[Timur|Tamerlane]] invaded Aleppo in 1400 and destroyed it, the Christians migrated out of the city walls and established their own cell in 1420, at the northwestern suburbs of the city, thus founding the quarters of al-Jdayde. The inhabitants of the new quarters were mainly brokers who facilitated trade between foreign traders and local merchants. As a result of the economic development, many other quarters were established outside the walls of the ancient city during the 15th and 16th centuries.

Thus, the [[Old City of Aleppo]] — composed of the ancient city within the walls and the old cell-like quarters outside the walls — has an approximate area of {{cvt|350|ha|sqmi}} housing more than 120,000 residents.<ref>{{cite web |author=bleeker |url=http://www.historische-aleppo-seife.de/engl_history.html |title=Alepposeife: Aleppo history |publisher=Historische-aleppo-seife.de |access-date=11 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180326040544/http://www.historische-aleppo-seife.de/engl_history.html |archive-date=26 March 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref>

According to the Aleppine historian Sheikh ''Kamel Al-Ghazzi'' (1853–1933), the population of Aleppo was around 400,000 before the disastrous [[1822 Aleppo earthquake|earthquake of 1822]]. Followed by cholera and plague attacks in 1823 and 1827 respectively, the population of the city declined to 110,000 by the end of the 19th century.<ref>Saint Terezia Church Aleppo [http://www.terezia.org/section.php?id=1823 Christians in Aleppo at the end of the Ottoman Empire] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009230825/http://www.terezia.org/section.php?id=1823 |date=9 October 2017 }}</ref> In 1901, the total population of Aleppo was 108,143 of which Muslims were 76,329 (70.58%), Christians — mostly Catholics — 24,508 (22.66%) and Jews 7,306 (6.76%).<ref>Alepppo in One Hundred Years 1850– 1950, vol.2-page 3, 1994 Aleppo. Authors: Mohammad Fuad Ayntabi and Najwa Othman</ref>

Aleppo's large Christian population swelled with the influx of [[Armenians in Syria|Armenian]] and [[Syrian-Assyrians|Assyrian]] Christian refugees during the early 20th-century and after the [[Armenian genocide|Armenian]] and [[Assyrian Genocide|Assyrian genocides]] of 1915. After the arrival of the first groups of [[Armenians in Syria|Armenian]] refugees (1915–1922) the population of Aleppo in 1922 counted 156,748 of which Muslims were 97,600 (62.26%), native Christians — mostly Catholics —  22,117 (14.11%), Jews 6,580 (4.20%), Europeans 2,652 (1.70%), Armenian refugees 20,007 (12.76%) and others 7,792 (4.97%).<ref>Alepppo in One Hundred Years 1850–1950, vol.3-page 26, 1994 Aleppo.

Author: Sheikh ''Kamel Al-Ghazzi''</ref> However, even though a large majority of the Armenians arrived during the period, the city has had an Armenian community since at least the 1100s, when a considerable number of Armenian families and merchants from the [[Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia]] settled in the city. The [[Forty Martyrs Cathedral|oldest Armenian church in the city]] is from 1491 as well, which indicates that they have been there long before.

According to the historical data presented by ''Al-Ghazzi'', the vast majority of the Aleppine Christians were Catholics until the latter days of the Ottoman rule. The growth of the [[Oriental Orthodox]] Christians is related with the arrival of the Assyrian survivors from Cilicia and Southern Turkey, while on the other hand, large numbers of [[Eastern Orthodox Church of Antioch|Eastern Orthodox Christians]] from the [[Hatay Province|Sanjak of Alexandretta]] arrived in Aleppo, after the annexation of the Sanjak in 1939 in favour of Turkey.

In 1944, Aleppo's population was around 325,000, with 112,110 (34.5%) Christians among which Armenians numbered 60,200. Armenians formed more than half of the Christian community in Aleppo until 1947, when many groups of them left for [[Soviet Armenia]] within the frames of the ''Armenian Repatriation Process (1946–1967)''.

Until the beginning of the Battle of Aleppo in 2012, the city contained one of the largest Christian communities in the [[Middle East]]. There were many [[Oriental Orthodox]] Christian congregations, mainly [[Armenians in Syria|Armenians]] and [[Assyrians in Syria|Assyrians]] (locally known as Syriacs). Historically, the city was the main centre of French Catholic missionaries in Syria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.catholicnews.sg/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2746&Itemid=120 |title=Catholic Doctor "Flies High" with The Flying Hospital to Treat the Less Fortunate in Aleppo, Syria |publisher=Catholicnews.sg |date=23 March 2009 |access-date=29 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020104335/http://www.catholicnews.sg/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2746&Itemid=120 |archive-date=20 October 2013}}</ref>

The Christian population of Aleppo was slightly more than 250,000 before the Syrian Civil War, representing about 12% of the total population of the city.

[[File:Aleppomusic.jpg|thumb|Musicians from Aleppo, 18th century]]
Aleppo is considered one of the main centres of Arabic traditional and classic music with the Aleppine ''[[Muwashshah]]s'', ''[[Qudud Halabiya]]'' and ''[[Arabic maqam|Maqams]]'' (religious, secular and folk poetic-musical genres). In December 2021, the Qudud Halabiya was included into the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists|UNESCO's intangible cultural heritage list]] as [[Intangible cultural heritage]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Al-Qudoud al-Halabiya |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/al-qudoud-al-halabiya-01578 |publisher=UNESCO Culture Sector |access-date=2021-12-18 |archive-date=15 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211215150323/https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/al-qudoud-al-halabiya-01578 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

Aleppines in general are fond of Arab classical music, the ''Tarab'', and it is not a surprise that many artists from Aleppo are considered pioneers among the Arabs in classic and traditional music. The most prominent figures in this field are Sabri Mdallal, [[Sabah Fakhri]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/sabah-fakhri-dies/2021/11/02/6e795a2a-3bdd-11ec-a493-51b0252dea0c_story.html |title=Sabah Fakhri, Syrian tenor who helped preserve classical Arabic music, dies at 88 |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=2021-11-02 |accessdate=2022-09-11 |archive-date=3 November 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20211103070023/https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/sabah-fakhri-dies/2021/11/02/6e795a2a-3bdd-11ec-a493-51b0252dea0c_story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Shadi Jamil]], [[Abed Azrie]] and [[Nour Mhanna]].

The city's strategic trading position attracted settlers of all races and beliefs who wished to take advantage of the commercial roads that met in Aleppo from as far as China and [[Mesopotamia]] to the east, Europe to the west, and the [[Fertile Crescent]] and [[Egypt]] to the south. The largest covered [[souq]]-market in the world is in Aleppo, with an approximate length of {{cvt|13|km|abbr=off}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&category=round&filename=201010291220021 |title=eAleppo: The old Souqs of Aleppo (in Arabic) |publisher=Esyria.sy |access-date=11 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330131845/http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&category=round&filename=201010291220021 |archive-date=30 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David, ''[http://www.cpamedia.com/article.php?pg=archive&acid=120601100823&aiid=120601101137 Aleppo's Great Bazaar] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140823085443/http://www.cpamedia.com/article.php?pg=archive&acid=120601100823&aiid=120601101137 |date=23 August 2014 }}''</ref>

''[[Al-Madina Souq]]'', as it is locally known, is an active trade centre for imported luxury goods, such as raw silk from [[Iran]], spices and dyes from India, and coffee from [[Damascus]]. Souq al-Madina is also home to local products such as wool, agricultural products and soap. Most of the souqs date back to the 14th century and are named after various professions and crafts, hence the wool souq, the copper souq, and so on. Aside from trading, the souq accommodated the traders and their goods in ''khans'' ([[caravanserai]]s) and scattered in the souq. Other types of small market-places were called ''caeserias'' (ﻗﻴﺴﺎﺭﻳﺎﺕ). Caeserias are smaller than khans in their sizes and functioned as workshops for craftsmen. Most of the khans took their names after their location in the souq and function, and are characterized by their façades, entrances and fortified wooden doors.

{{Main|Dead Cities}}
[[File:Kharab Shams Basilica, Dead Cities region, NW Syria.jpg|thumb|left|Kharab Shams Basilica, 4th century]]
Aleppo's western suburbs are home to a group of historical sites and villages which are commonly known as the ''[[Dead Cities]]''. Around 700 abandoned settlements in the northwestern parts of Syria before the 5th century, contain remains of Christian [[Byzantine architecture]]. Many hundreds of those settlements are in [[Mount Simeon]] (Jabal Semaan) and Jabal Halaqa regions at the western suburbs of Aleppo, within the range of [[Limestone Massif]].<ref>[http://www.syria.strabon.org/ua/pm_villesmortes/antique-villages/index_en.html Ancient villages (dead cities)]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Dead Cities were inscribed as a [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2011, under the name of "Ancient Villages of Northern Syria".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1348 |title=Ancient Villages of Northern Syria |author=UNESCO |access-date=30 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111018204926/http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1348/ |archive-date=18 October 2011 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Public transport===
[[File:Microbus Station (1265057959).jpg|250px|thumb|Microbus station in the city center]]
The city of Aleppo is a major transportation hub, served by a comprehensive [[public transport]] network of buses and minibuses. New modern buses are used to connect the city with Damascus and the other Syrian cities to the east and the south of Aleppo. The city is also served by local and inter-city [[share taxis]].

===Railway===
[[File:Aleppo Bagdad Railway Station, cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Aleppo railway station]] (Gare de Baghdad)]]
Aleppo was one of the major stations of Syria that was connected to the [[Baghdad Railway]] in 1912, within the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The connections to Turkey and onwards to [[Ankara]] still exist today, with a twice weekly train from Damascus. It is perhaps for this historical reason that Aleppo is the headquarters of Syria national railway network, [[Chemins de Fer Syriens]]. As the railway is relatively slow, much of the passenger traffic to the port of [[Latakia]] had moved to road-based air-conditioned coaches. But this has reversed in recent years with the 2005 introduction of South Korean built [[Diesel multiple unit|DMUs]] providing a regular bi-hourly express service to both Latakia and Damascus, which miss intermediate stations.

However, after the break-out of the civil war in 2011, the Syrian railway network has suffered major damage and is partially out of use. Reconstruction of the Damascus-Aleppo railway line was started in 2020, after its completion and securing rail transport will be resumed.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://sana.sy/en/?p=186448 |title=General Establishment of Railways: Aleppo-Damascus railway to be put into service in May |publisher=Syrian Arab News Agency |author=Hybah Sleman / Hazem Sabbagh |date=24 February 2020 |access-date=3 February 2022 |archive-date=2 February 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220202092043/https://sana.sy/en/?p=186448 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The opening scene in [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[Murder on the Orient Express]]'' takes place on the railway station in Aleppo: "It was five o'clock on a winter's morning in Syria. Alongside the platform at Aleppo stood the train grandly designated in railway guides as the Taurus Express."

===Airport===
[[File:Aleppo (2) cropped.jpg|thumb|upright 1.2|[[Aleppo International Airport]]]]
[[Aleppo International Airport]] ([[IATA]]: ALP, [[ICAO]]: OSAP) is the international airport serving the city. The airport serves as a secondary hub for [[Syrian Arab Airlines]]. The history of the airport dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. It was upgraded and developed in the years to 1999 when the new current terminal was opened.<ref>Aleppo Int. Airport [http://www.terezia.org/section.php?id=1823 Historical Overview] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009230825/http://www.terezia.org/section.php?id=1823 |date=9 October 2017 }}</ref>

The airport was closed since the beginning of 2013 as a result of the military operations in the area. However, following the Syrian government's recapture of eastern Aleppo during the [[Battle of Aleppo (2012–16)|Battle of Aleppo]], an airplane conducted its first flight from the airport in four years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/first-airplane-takes-off-aleppo-international-airport-4-years/ |title=First airplane takes off from Aleppo International Airport in 4 years |access-date=6 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106151817/https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/first-airplane-takes-off-aleppo-international-airport-4-years/ |archive-date=6 January 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Economy==

===Trade and industry===
[[File:Aleppo, textile suq market.jpg|left|thumb|Traditional textile and rug markets]]
The main role of the city was as a trading place throughout the history, as it sat at the crossroads of two trade routes and mediated the trade from India, the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] regions and the route coming from [[Damascus]] in the South, which traced the base of the mountains rather than the rugged seacoast. Although trade was often directed away from the city for political reasons {{Why?|date=January 2012}}, it continued to thrive until the Europeans began to use the [[Cape of Good Hope|Cape route]] to India and later to utilize the route through [[Egypt]] to the [[Red Sea]].

The commercial traditions in Aleppo have deep roots in the history. The Aleppo Chamber of commerce founded in 1885, is one of the oldest chambers in the Middle East and the Arab world. According to many historians, Aleppo was the most developed commercial and industrial city in the [[Ottoman Empire]] after [[Constantinople]] and [[Cairo]].<ref name="Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire"/>

As the largest urban area in pre-civil war Syria, Aleppo was considered the capital of Syrian industry.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dnnar.com/index.php/markets/13869/6-3-2017-12-4 |title=معرض خان الحرير في حلب عاصمة الصناعة السورية |access-date=29 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009222521/http://www.dnnar.com/index.php/markets/13869/6-3-2017-12-4 |archive-date=9 October 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> The economy of the city was mainly driven by textiles, chemicals, pharmaceutics, agro-processing industries, electrical commodities, alcoholic beverages, engineering and tourism.

The industrial city of Aleppo in [[Shaykh Najjar|Sheikh Najjar]] district is one of the largest in Syria and the region. Occupying an area of {{cvt|4412|ha|acre}} in the north-eastern suburbs of Aleppo, the total investments in the city counted more than US$3.4&nbsp;billion during 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aksalser.com/?page=view_news&id=5ace559cb86c8b34f1e024e479b11815&ar=17773089 |title=155 billion Syrian Pounds invested in Aleppo Industrial City (in Arabic) |publisher=Aksalser.com |access-date=11 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303110557/http://www.aksalser.com/?page=view_news&id=5ace559cb86c8b34f1e024e479b11815&ar=17773089 |archive-date=3 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> Still under development, it is envisaged to open hotels, exhibition centres and other facilities within the industrial city.

===Construction===
[[File:AleppoCitadel.jpg|thumb|The restored square of the citadel]]
In the 2000s, Aleppo was one of the fastest-growing cities in Syria and the Middle East.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Report Syria 2011 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oDz9juos_tkC&pg=PA195 |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford Business Group |isbn=978-1-907065-34-7 |page=195 |access-date=19 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191029010342/https://books.google.com/books?id=oDz9juos_tkC&pg=PA195 |archive-date=29 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> Many villagers and inhabitants of other Syrian districts are migrating to Aleppo in an effort to find better job opportunities, a fact that always increases population pressure, with a growing demand for new residential capacity. New districts and residential communities have been built in the suburbs of Aleppo, many of them were still under construction {{As of|2010|lc=on}}.

Two major construction projects are scheduled in Aleppo: the "Old City Revival" project and the "Reopening of the stream bed of Queiq River":
*The Old City revival project completed its first phase by the end of 2008, and the second phase started in early 2010. The purpose of the project is the preservation of the old city of Aleppo with its souqs and khans, and restoration of the narrow alleys of the old city and the roads around the citadel.
*The restoration of [[Queiq River]] is directed towards the revival of the flow of the river, demolishing both the artificial cover of the stream bed and the reinforcement of the stream banks along the river in the city centre. The flow of the river was blocked during the 1960s by the Turks, turning the river into a tiny sewage channel, something that led the authorities to cover the stream during the 1970s. In 2008 the flow of pure water was restored through the efforts of the Syrian government, granting a new life to the Quweiq River.<ref name="station">{{Cite news |url=https://sana.sy/en/?p=277384 |title=President al-Assad inaugurates Tal Hasel water pumping plant, Aleppo |author=Shaza Qreima |publisher=SANA |access-date=10 July 2022 |date=8 July 2022 |archive-date=9 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220709184201/http://sana.sy/en/?p=277384 |url-status=live }}</ref> 

Like other major Syrian cities, Aleppo is suffering from the dispersal of [[informal settlements]]: almost half of its population (around 1.2&nbsp;million) is estimated to live in 22 informal settlements of different types.<ref>{{cite web |title=Madinatuna, Aleppo Cite Development Strategy: Informal Settlements |url=http://madinatuna.com/en/informals |access-date=14 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100505211725/http://madinatuna.com/en/informals |archive-date=5 May 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==Municipality==
[[File:Aleppo city hall laz.jpg|thumb|Aleppo City Hall]]
The city of Aleppo is the capital of [[Aleppo Governorate]] and the centre of [[Mount Simeon District]]. Aleppo City Council is the governing body of the city. The first municipality council was formed in 1868.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&category=ruins&filename=201111062205011 |title=eAleppo:Khans in Aleppo |publisher=Esyria.sy |access-date=11 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120629185847/http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&category=ruins&filename=201111062205011 |archive-date=29 June 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> However, the governor being appointed directly by the president of the republic, has a supreme authority over the city and the entire governorate. But the city is managed directly by the mayor.

===Subdivisions===
{{See also|Ancient City of Aleppo}}
[[File:السلام.jpg|180px|thumb|Suleimaniyeh District, St George's Church and [[Tawhid Mosque]], 2020]]
Districts in Aleppo can be considered in four categories:
*Old quarters inside the walls of the ancient city.
*Old quarters outside the walls of the ancient city.
*Modern neighborhoods, including a newly developed area called The New Aleppo.
*Informal settlements.

===Integrated Urban Development in Aleppo===
[[File:Covered Suq of Aleppo2.JPG|thumb|''Souq al-Dira''', maintaining its traditional role as a tailoring centre]]
The "Integrated Urban Development in Aleppo" (UDP) is a joint programme between the German Development Cooperation (GTZ) and the Municipality of Aleppo.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.udp-aleppo.org/ |title=UDP-Aleppo |publisher=UDP-Aleppo |date=15 December 2011 |access-date=11 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120315104149/http://www.udp-aleppo.org/ |archive-date=15 March 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref> The programme promotes capacities for sustainable urban management and development at the national and municipal level.

The Programme has three fields of work:
# Aleppo City Development Strategy (CDS): promoting support structures for the municipality, including capacity building, networking, and developing municipal strength in the national development dialogue.
# Informal Settlements (IS): includes strategy and management development of informal settlements.
# The Project for the Rehabilitation of the Old City of Aleppo (OCA): includes further support for the rehabilitation of the Old City, as well as for a city development strategy oriented to the long term.

The UDP cooperates closely with other interventions in the sector, namely the EU-supported 'Municipal Administration Modernization' programme. It is planned to operate from 2007 to 2016.

===Preservation of the ancient city===
[[File:Khan al-Wazir with Sahibiyah mosque.jpg|thumb|left|Khan al-Wazir after rehabilitation in 2009]]
As an ancient trading centre, Aleppo has impressive ''[[souq]]s'', ''khans'', ''hammams'', ''madrasas'', mosques and churches, all in need of more care and preservation work. After [[World War II]] the city was significantly redesigned; in 1954 French architect [[André Gutton]] had a number of wide new roads cut through the city to allow easier passage for modern traffic. Between 1954 and 1983 many buildings in the old city were demolished to allow for the construction of modern apartment blocks, particularly in the northwestern areas (Bab al-Faraj and [[Bab al-Jinan]]). As awareness for the need to preserve this unique cultural heritage increased, Gutton's master plan was finally abandoned in 1979 to be replaced with a new plan presented by the Swiss expert and [[urban designer]] [[Stefano Bianca]], which adopted the idea of "preserving the traditional architectural style of Ancient Aleppo" paving the way for [[UNESCO]] to declare the [[Old City of Aleppo]] as a World Heritage Site in 1986.<ref name="Aleppo plan">{{cite web |title=eAleppo:Aleppo city major plans throughout the history |url=http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&category=misc&filename=201009251220032 |language=ar |access-date=27 September 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121218150720/http://www.esyria.sy/ealeppo/index.php?p=stories&category=misc&filename=201009251220032 |archive-date=18 December 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>
[[File:Khandaq6 Alp.jpg|thumb|The historic street of al-Khandaq, restored just before the civil war]]
Several international institutions have joined efforts with local authorities and the Aleppo Archaeological Society, to rehabilitate the old city by accommodating contemporary life while preserving the old one. The governorate and the municipality are implementing serious programmes directed towards the enhancement of the ancient city and Jdeydeh quarter.

The German Technical Cooperation ([[GTZ]]) and [[Aga Khan Foundation]] (within the frames of [[Aga Khan Historic Cities Programme]]) has made a great contribution in the preservation process of the old city.
