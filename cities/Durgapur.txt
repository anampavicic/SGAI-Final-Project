===Location===
Durgapur is located at {{Coord|23.55|N|87.32|E|}}. It has an average elevation of {{convert|65|m|ft}}.

Durgapur is in the [[Paschim Bardhaman district]] of West Bengal, on the bank of the [[Damodar River]], just before it enters the alluvial plains of Bengal. The topography is undulating. The coal-bearing area of the [[Raniganj]] coalfields lies just beyond Durgapur; some parts intrude into the area. The area was deeply forested until recent times, and some streaks of the original [[Shorea robusta|sal]] and [[eucalyptus]] forests can still be seen.
