'''Batala''' is the eighth largest city in the state of [[Punjab, India]] in terms of population after [[Ludhiana]], [[Amritsar]], [[Jalandhar]], [[Patiala]], [[Bathinda]], [[Mohali]] and [[Hoshiarpur]]. Batala ranks as the second-oldest city after Bathinda. It is a [[municipal corporation]] (since 3 March 2019) in [[Gurdaspur district]] in the [[Majha]] region of the state of Punjab. It is located about 32&nbsp;km from [[Gurdaspur]], the headquarters of the district. It is also a [[Police district]]. Batala holds the status of the most populated town of the district with 31% of the district's total population. It is the biggest industrial town in the district.

Batala is an important place for [[Sikh]] devotees. [[Guru Nanak Dev|Guru Nanak]], the founder of the Sikh religion was married here to Sulakhni, the daughter of Mul Chand Chauna in 1485.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gurdaspur.nic.in/html/profile.htm#history|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050802074716/http://gurdaspur.nic.in/html/profile.htm#history|url-status=dead|archive-date=2005-08-02|title=About District}}</ref> Many [[temple]]s and [[gurdwara]]s related to the guru's marriage attract devotees from near and far. Every year celebrations are conducted on the anniversary of Nanak's marriage (Babe Nanak Da Viah) at Gurudwara Kandh Sahib. There is also a historical gurdwara Satkartarian Sahib related to 6th [[Sikh gurus|guru of Sikhs]], [[Guru Hargobind]].

Batala was once known as the "Iron Bird of Asia" as it produced the highest amount of [[cast iron]], agricultural and mechanical machinery. Batala is still one of the leading cities in [[North India|Northern India]] in manufacturing of cast iron and mechanical machinery. It's also an agricultural marketplace and industrial center. Cotton ginning, weaving, sugar refining, and rice milling are some of other industries.

== History ==
{{Further|Punjab|Radcliffe Line}}
The city was founded in 1465 by Abhay Pratap Bal of [[Bhati Rajputs of Kapurthala|Kapurthala]] under the suzerainty of [[Sultan]] [[Bahlul Lodi]]. Later, during the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal rule]], [[Akbar]] gave it in [[jagir]] to his foster brother, Shamsher Khan. Batala was a very famous city of the Punjab region, just like [[Lahore]], [[Jalandhar]] and other major cities in the 16th century, and it is 109 years older than [[Amritsar]]. The whole city was lying within a fort. It had 12 gates as entrances and exit. These gates are still known by their old names, e.g. Sheran Wala Gate, Khajuri Gate, Bhandari Gate, Ohri Gate, Thathiari Gate, Hathi Gate, Pahari Gate, Mori Gate, Kapoori Gate, Achli Gate etc. Some of them still survive although their condition is in need of attention.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V07_139.gif|title=Imperial Gazetteer2 of India, Volume 7, page 133 -- Imperial Gazetteer of India -- Digital South Asia Library|website=dsal.uchicago.edu|accessdate=8 October 2023}}</ref>

Other historic places in Batala are [[gurdwaras]] where [[Guru Nanak]] stayed during his lifetime. There are also numerous other gurdwaras of significant importance to [[Sikhs]] and therefore attract thousands of Sikhs from around the globe.

In [[British India]], Batala was the headquarters of a ''[[tehsil]]'' in the Gurdaspur district of the [[Punjab Province (British India)|Punjab Province]]. The allocation of the Gurdaspur district during the [[partition of India]] was highly contested because it was in central Punjab and had roughly equal proportion of Muslim and non-Muslim populations. Viceroy [[Lord Wavell]] allocated three eastern tehsils of the district ([[Gurdaspur district|Gurdaspur, Batala]] and [[Pathankot district|Pathankot]]) to India, and one western tehsil ([[Shakargarh Tehsil|Shakargarh]]) to Pakistan. However, it continued to be contested. The whole district was shown as part of Pakistan in the 'notional partition line' in the [[Indian Independence Act 1947]] and the issue was referred to the [[Radcliffe Line|Punjab Boundary Commission]]. The final partition line ('[[Radcliffe Line]]') eventually confirmed Wavell's division of the district, with the result that Batala became part of India. For three days, 14–17 August 1947, Batala was regarded as part of Pakistan, then added to Indian territory.<ref>{{citation |last1=Tan |first1=Tai Yong |last2=Kudaisya |first2=Gyanesh  |title=The Aftermath of Partition in South Asia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aPOBAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA91 |date=2000 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-44048-1|pages=91–}}</ref><ref>{{citation |last=Sialkoti |first=Zulfiqar Ali |title=An Analytical Study of the Punjab Boundary Line Issue during the Last Two Decades of the British Raj until the Declaration of 3 June 1947 |journal=Pakistan Journal of History and Culture |volume=XXXV |number=2 |year=2014  |url=http://www.nihcr.edu.pk/Latest_English_Journal/Pjhc%2035-2,%202014/4%20Punjab%20Boundary%20Line,%20Zulfiqar%20Ali.pdf }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ilahi |first1=Shereen |title=The Radcliffe Boundary Commission and the Fate of Kashmir |journal=India Review |volume=2 |issue=1 |year=2003 |pages=77–102 |issn=1473-6489 |doi=10.1080/714002326|s2cid=153890196 }}</ref>

At the time of partition in 1947, Batala had a majority Muslim population. After the partition line was announced, Muslims left Batala and went to Pakistan and Hindus and Sikhs migrated from Pakistan to Batala. The city now has a Hindu majority which holds more than 56% of city's total population with a large Sikh minority at 38%.

==Politics==
The city is part of the [[Batala Assembly Constituency]].

Located in Gurdaspur district, {{convert|38|km|mi}} from Amritsar on the Kashmir [[Grand Trunk road]].
One of the older towns in the province of Lahore in earlier times, Batala is home to many monuments of religious and historic importance, such as Hazira Park, Barah Dari, Hakikat Samadh. These monuments are connected with [[Sikh]] history and the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] period. The city consists of several churches constructed during the [[British Raj]].

=== Jal Mahal (Baradari) ===

The Jal Mahal and the palace of Maharaja Sher Singh were built by the Maharaja (CE 1780–1839). The palace is under the control of the authorities of the local Baring Union Christian College. The administrative offices of the college are housed in it. Jal Mahal is under the control of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). Jal Mahal (Baradari) and the palace of Maharaja Sher Singh were connected through a tunnel. According to some senior citizens, Shamsher Khan Tank of Jal Mahal used to be filled with water through the tunnel, which was further connected to a long tunnel (canal) to the Beas, near Kahnuwan. The remnants of the tunnel can be seen near Baring Christian College.

Maharaja Sher Singh used to hold meetings of his courtiers in Jal Mahal. The water reservoir was built by Shamsher Khan while the beautiful Baradari in the centre of the tank was constructed by Maharaja Sher Singh. It has a square room in the centre of a pavilion with a passageway. The entry to the first floor is by a staircase with concave-shaped steps on the north-eastern canal. Jal Mahal has eight doors in the lower part of the building and four in the upper storey. The inner wall contained beautiful art glass carvings and wall paintings. However, major parts of the paintings have been erased or damaged. The roof of the pavilion has also fallen. The Municipal Council provided a tubewell to fill up the tank till the eighties. All sides of the reservoir were lined with Nanakshahi bricks. However, with the passage of time the brick lining has been destroyed. Nowadays, on one side of the tank is located a vridh ashram owned and managed by the Dainik Prarthana Sabha. There also exists Bhadr Kali Mandir and Shivala. The upper portion of Jal Mahal is in a dilapidated condition and the time is not far when this magnificent structure will pass into oblivion.

Guru Nanak Dev Ji was married here to Bibi Sulakhani Ji. He was engaged to the daughter of Mul Chand Chauna who along with the Brahmin priests insisted on a traditional Hindu marriage while Guru Nanak Dev Ji wanted a simple marriage. Guru Nanak Dev ji was sitting beside a crooked mud wall (kandh) discussing the marriage plans with the Brahmin clergy. It was planned to push the wall on top of the Guru but Guru Nanak Dev ji was warned of the plan by an old woman. Guru Nanak Dev Ji just smiled and said "This wall will not fall for centuries. The will of God shall prevail." The wall is still preserved within the Gurdwara and a celebration is held here every year on the anniversary of Guru Nanak's marriage. At walking distance of two minutes there is Gurudwara Dera sahib, which was house of Mata Sulakhni Ji (bride of Guru Nanak dev ji). An ancient well is situated in Gurudwara dera sahib, it is said that water of well is having special curing powers in itself.

Haqiqat Rai Puri was born into a Hindu family, in Sialkot, Punjab, Mughal India with his caste being a Puri Khatri.[6] His father's name was Bagh Mal Rai, a Hindu trader. At the age of 14, Rai was sent to a Maulvi to learn Persian. One day some of his Muslim classmates were making fun of various Hindu deities, ridiculing his religion. In return he asked them how they would feel if anyone insulted Muhammad or Ayesha. For this, his classmates reported this to the Maulvi as it was taken as an insult of Islam.

As a result, he was taken to Lahore (then a provincial capital in the Mughal Empire), where he was given the option to convert to Islam to save his life, but he refused. As a result, he was beheaded at the age of 14, during the governorship of Zakariya Khan. Quasi Abdul Haq, who was responsible for the Fatwa, was also beheaded later by Sardar Dal Singh and Saradar Mana Singh and shown around the city of Batala
