Guizhou borders the autonomous region of [[Guangxi]] to the south, [[Yunnan]] to the west, [[Sichuan]] to the northwest, the municipality of [[Chongqing]] to the north, and [[Hunan]] to the east. The Guizhou Province has a [[Humid subtropical climate]]. It covers a total area of 176,200 square kilometers and consists of 6 [[Prefecture-level city|prefecture-level cities]] and 3 [[autonomous prefecture]]s. The population of Guizhou stands at 38.5 million, [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by population|ranking 18th]] among the provinces in China.

Guizhou is a mountainous province, with its higher altitudes in the west and centre. It lies at the eastern end of the [[Yungui Plateau]]. Demographically, it is one of China's most diverse provinces. Minority groups account for more than 37% of the population, including sizable populations of the [[Miao people|Miao]], [[Bouyei people|Bouyei]], [[Kam people|Dong]], [[Tujia people|Tujia]] and [[Yi people|Yi]] peoples, all of whom speak languages distinct from Chinese. The main language spoken in Guizhou is [[Southwestern Mandarin]], a variety of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].

Evidence of settlement by humans during the [[Middle Palaeolithic]] is indicated by stone artefacts, including [[Levallois technique|Levallois]] pieces, found during archaeological excavations at Guanyindong Cave.

During the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC–220 AD), to which the Dian was tributary, Guizhou was home to the [[Yelang]] collection of tribes, which largely governed themselves before the Han consolidated control in the southwest and established the [[Lingnan]] province.<ref name=lp/> During the [[Three Kingdoms]] period, parts of Guizhou were governed by the [[Shu Han]] state based in [[Sichuan]], followed by [[Cao Wei]] (220–266) and the [[Jin dynasty (266–420)|Jin dynasty]] (266–420).<ref name=lp/>

During the 8th and 9th centuries in the [[Tang dynasty]], Chinese soldiers moved into Guizhou (Kweichow) and married native women.

[[Kublai Khan]] and [[Möngke Khan]] conquered the Chinese southwest in the process of defeating the Song during the [[Mongol conquest of China|Mongol invasion of China]], and the newly established [[Yuan dynasty]] (1279–1368) saw the importation of [[Chinese Muslim]] administrators and settlers from [[Bukhara]] in Central Asia.<ref name=lp/>

It was during the following [[Ming dynasty]], which was once again led by [[Han Chinese]], that Guizhou was formally made a province in 1413.

'''Regional history'''

In the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), Guizhou established 6 administrative supervision areas, each in charge of several counties. In the 30th year (1941), Guiyang City was established. By the 37th year (1948), Guizhou had 1 direct jurisdiction area, 6 administrative supervision areas, and 78 counties (cities) under its administration.

On November 15, 1949, the Second Field Army of the [[People's Liberation Army|Chinese People's Liberation]] Army liberated [[Guiyang]]; on December 26, the People's Government of Guizhou<ref>{{Cite web |title=Contact Us |url=http://www.eguizhou.gov.cn/2023-07/18/c_341683.htm |access-date=2024-05-28 |website=www.eguizhou.gov.cn}}</ref> Province was established. In the early period after liberation, the province had 1 directly managed city, 8 special areas, and 1 special area city, totaling 79 counties.

== Geography ==
[[File:Mount Fanjing, 31 March 2020ii.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Mount Fanjing]] in Guizhou]]

=== Topography and landforms ===
Guizhou Province is located on the [[Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau|Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau]], between longitudes 103°36′ to 109°35′ east and latitudes 24°37′ to 29°13′ north. The average altitude is around 1100 meters. It borders Hunan to the east, [[Guangxi]] to the south, [[Yunnan]] to the west, and [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]] to the north. It stretches approximately 595 kilometers from east to west and about 509 kilometers from north to south. The total area of Guizhou Province is 176,167 square kilometers, accounting for 1.8% of the total area of China. The easternmost point is in Di Lake Township, [[Tianzhu County, Guizhou|Tianzhu]] County, Qiandongnan Prefecture. The westernmost point is in Yulong Township(玉龙乡), [[Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County|Weining]] County, Bijie City. The southernmost point is in Luowan Township(洛万乡), [[Xingyi, Guizhou|Xingyi]] City, Qianxinan Prefecture. The northernmost point is in Yangxi Town(阳溪镇), [[Daozhen Gelao and Miao Autonomous County|Daozhen]] County, Zunyi City.

Guizhou is a mountainous province, although its higher altitudes are in the west and centre. It lies at the eastern end of the [[Yungui Plateau]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinatoday.com/city/guizhou.htm|title=Guizhou Province|publisher=ChinaToday.com|access-date=29 February 2016}}</ref> At {{convert|2900|m|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, Jiucaiping is Guizhou's highest point.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://k.sina.com.cn/article_6126556993_16d2bd741001005vb1.html?from=travel |script-title=zh:贵州最高的山——韭菜坪，千年难得一见的美景 |quote={{lang|zh-hans|韭菜坪海拔2900米，是贵州最高的山峰，它位于六盘水市与赫章县的交界处，因每到8，9月份山上开满野生韭菜花故得其名。}} |website=[[Sina Corp|Sina]] }}</ref>

Guizhou Plateau is predominantly mountainous, and its topography can be generally divided into three basic types: [[plateau]] mountains, [[hill]]s, and basins(盆地), with 92.5% of the area being mountains and hills. There are numerous mountain ranges within the province, with overlapping ridges and peaks stretching across the landscape. In the north, there is the [[Dalou Mountains|Dalou Mountain]], which runs diagonally from the west to the northeast, with the important pass [[Loushan Pass]] at an altitude of 1444 meters; in the central and southern part, Miaoling Mountain(苗岭) <ref>{{Cite web |last=胡靓钰 |title=Scenery of Miaoling national geological park in SW China's Guizhou - Xinhua {{!}} English.news.cn |url=http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2018-01/07/c_136878240.htm |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=www.xinhuanet.com}}</ref> Range stretches across, with its main peak, Leigong Mountain(雷公山),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Leigong Mountain - Opening Hours, Reviews & Photos [2024] |url=https://www.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/leishan/leigong-mountain-80909/ |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=TRIP.COM |language=en-XX}}</ref> at 2178 meters; in the northeastern part, there is the [[Wuling Mountains|Wuling Mountain]] Range, which winds into Guizhou from Hunan, with its main peak, [[Fanjingshan|Fanjing Mountain]], at 2572 meters; in the west, there is the towering Wumeng Mountain(乌蒙山),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wumengshan National Geological Park - Tickets, Opening Hours, Reviews & Photos [2024] |url=https://www.trip.com/travel-guide/attraction/liupanshui/wumengshan-national-geological-park-93693/ |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=TRIP.COM |language=en-XX}}</ref> with the highest point in Guizhou being Jiucaiping(韭菜坪) in Zhushi Township(珠市乡), [[Hezhang County]], at an altitude of 2900.6 meters.

=== Climate ===
Guizhou has a [[humid subtropical climate]]. There are few seasonal changes. Its annual average temperature is roughly 10 to 20&nbsp;°C, with January temperatures ranging from 1 to 10&nbsp;°C and July temperatures ranging from 17 to 28&nbsp;°C. with annual rainfall ranging from 1000 to 1400 millimeters; the frost-free period lasts between 250 and 300 days. There is no severe cold in winter and no extreme heat in summer, with the coldest month of January averaging 4-6 degrees Celsius, and the hottest month of July averaging 15-23 degrees Celsius. The unique climatic characteristics make Guizhou an ideal place for leisure travel and summer retreats.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Discover the Guizhou Climate: Weather and Temperature |url=https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainfall-Temperature-Sunshine-region-guizhou-cn,China |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=World Weather & Climate Information |language=en}}</ref>
Precipitation is abundant, with a distinct rainy season, many cloudy days, and less sunshine, with the number of cloudy days generally exceeding 150 days throughout the year, and the annual relative humidity above 70%. Influenced by atmospheric circulation and terrain, Guizhou's climate is diverse, with the saying. Additionally, the climate is unstable, with a variety of disastrous weather conditions such as [[drought]]s, autumn winds, [[freezing]], and [[hail]], which can have a significant impact on agricultural production.

Like in China's other southwest provinces, rural areas of Guizhou suffered severe drought during spring 2010. Beginning on 3 April 2010, China's premier [[Wen Jiabao]] went on a three-day inspection tour in the southwest drought-affected province of Guizhou, where he met villagers and called on agricultural scientists to develop drought-resistant technologies for the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-04/05/c_13238009.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409122914/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2010-04/05/c_13238009.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=April 9, 2010|title=China's premier concerned about drought in SW China|publisher=[[Xinhua]]|date=2010-04-05|access-date=2008-09-17}}</ref>

Because of its lesser development compared to many other provinces in China, Guizhou's environment is well-preserved.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Hu |first=Richard |title=Reinventing the Chinese City |date=2023 |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |isbn=978-0-231-21101-7 |location=New York}}</ref>{{Rp|page=61}} As of at least 2023, its environment and favorable climate have been assets in attracting the new, increasingly digital, economy.<ref name=":0" />{{Rp|page=61}}

=== Hydrology ===
Guizhou Province's rivers are located in the upper reaches of the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] and [[Pearl River]] basins, with 69 counties falling within the scope of the Yangtze River protective forest conservation area,<ref>{{Cite web |title=FAOLEX |url=https://www.fao.org/faolex/results/details/en/c/LEX-FAOC200902/ |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=www.fao.org}}</ref> making it an important ecological barrier for the upper reaches of both the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers. The water system of the province flows from the west and center towards the north, east, and south according to the terrain. Miao Ridge serves as the watershed between the Yangtze and Pearl River basins; to the north lies the Yangtze River basin, covering an area of 115,747 square kilometers, accounting for 65.7% of the province's total land area, with major rivers including: [[Wu River (Yangtze tributary)|Wu River]], [[Chishui River]], [[Qingshuijiang, Liling|Qingshuijiang]], Hongzhou River(洪州河), [[Wu River (Yuan River, north)|Wuyang River]], [[Jinjiang, Chengdu|Jinjiang]], Songtao River(松桃河)， Songkan River(松坎河), Niulan River(牛栏江), Hengjiang(横江), etc.; to the south of Miao Ridge lies the Pearl River basin, covering an area of 60,420 square kilometers, accounting for 34.3% of the province's total land area, with major rivers including: [[Nanpan River]], [[Beipan River]], [[Hongshui River]], [[Duliu River]], Dagou River(打狗河), etc. Guizhou has a large number of rivers with continuous flow, and there are 984 rivers with a length of more than 10 kilometers.

== Natural Resources ==

=== Water resources ===
Guizhou Province has a large number of rivers, with 984 rivers that are over 10 kilometers long. In 2002, the runoff volume of Guizhou's rivers reached 114.52 billion cubic meters.<ref>{{Cite web |last=道客巴巴 |title=贵州省2002年水资源公报 |url=https://www.doc88.com/p-5743113873196.html |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=www.doc88.com}}</ref> The mountainous characteristics of Guizhou's rivers are evident, with most rivers having broad valleys and gentle water flow in the upper reaches, with small water volume; the middle reaches have alternating tight and open valleys with rapid water flow; the lower reaches have deep and narrow valleys, with large water volume and abundant hydropower resources. The potential of hydropower resources is 18.745 million kilowatts, ranking sixth in China,<ref>{{Cite web |title=水资源公报 |url=http://www.mwr.gov.cn/sj/tjgb/szygb/ |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=www.mwr.gov.cn}}</ref> of which 16.833 million kilowatts are exploitable, accounting for 4.4% of China's total, with many concentrated river sections with large water level drops, and favorable development conditions.

=== Land resources ===
Guizhou Province's land resources are predominantly mountainous and hilly, with relatively few plains. The mountainous area is 108,740 square kilometers, accounting for 61.7% of the total land area of Guizhou Province. The hilly area is 54,197 square kilometers, accounting for 31.1% of the total land area of Guizhou Province. The area of mountainous flatlands is 13,230 square kilometers, only accounting for 7.5% of the total land area of Guizhou Province.<ref>{{Cite web |title=中国地理小知识｜"地无三里平"的贵州 原来没有这个？ {{!}} 人文地理 {{!}} 通识中国 |url=https://www.ourchinastory.com/cn/8220 |access-date=2024-06-01 |website=当代中国}}</ref> There is a limited amount of land resources available for agricultural development. Due to the increasing population and the growth of non-agricultural land use, the area of arable land is continuously decreasing. By the end of 2002, the actual area of arable land in Guizhou Province was 17,694 square kilometers, a reduction of 629 square kilometers compared to 2001. The per capita area of arable land is less than 0.05 hectares, which is significantly lower than the national average of China. The proportion of arable land with thick soil layers, high fertility, and good water conditions is low.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Lee |first1=Kyo Suk |last2=Lee |first2=Dong Sung |last3=Min |first3=Se Won |last4=Kim |first4=ung Chul |last5=Seo |first5=Il-Hwan |last6=Chung |first6=Doug Young |date=2018-11-30 |title=Spatial Changes and Land Use of Arable Land in China |url=https://www.kjssf.org/articles/xml/ojWj/www.kjssf.org/articles/article/ojWj/ |journal=Korean Journal of Soil Science and Fertilizer |language=ko-KR |volume=51 |issue=4 |pages=327–338 |doi=10.7745/KJSSF.2018.51.4.327 |issn=0367-6315|doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Rail ===
Guizhou's rail network consists primarily of a cross formed by the [[Sichuan–Guizhou railway|Sichuan–Guizhou]], [[Guizhou–Guangxi Railway|Guangxi–Guizhou]] and [[Shanghai–Kunming railway|Shanghai–Kunming]] railways, which intersect at the provincial capital, [[Guiyang]], near the center of the province. The [[Liupanshui–Baiguo railway|Liupanshui–Baiguo]], [[Pan County West Railway|Pan County West]] and [[Weishe–Hongguo railway|Weishe–Hongguo]] railways form a rail corridor along Guizhou's western border with [[Yunnan]]. This corridor connects the [[Neijiang–Kunming railway]], which dips into northwestern Guizhou at [[Weining Yi, Hui, and Miao Autonomous County|Weining]], with the [[Nanning–Kunming railway]], which skirts the southwestern corner of Guizhou at [[Xingyi City|Xingyi]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

As of 2018, [[Shanghai–Kunming high-speed railway|Shanghai–Kunming]] and [[Guiyang–Guangzhou high-speed railway|Guiyang–Guangzhou]] high-speed railways are operational. [[Chengdu–Guiyang high-speed railway]] is under construction.
