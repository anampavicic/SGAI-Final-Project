==Etymology==
The derivation of the name of Calapan cannot be traced with certainty. Some opined that it comes from the word “Kalap” which means to gather logs. Thus “Kalapan” was supposed to be a place where logs were gathered. In the old records, however, there was never a mention of Calapan as a place where logs were produced or exported. Furthermore, huge forest trees where logs were produced certainly did not grow near the town, which was swampy. Another theory states that Calapan was originally pronounced as “Kalapang” which, according to an old Tagalog dictionary, was a synonym for “sanga” or branch. It could then refer to the settlement of Kalapang as a branch of its mother town of Baco, an adjoining town. The name was later hispanized as Calapan.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==History==
Calapan was formerly a small village before the establishment of the first Religious District in [[Baco, Oriental Mindoro|Baco]]. The District convent was transferred to Calapan in 1733 and began its jurisdiction over the Northern Mindoro Ecclesiastical Area.<ref name="history">{{cite web|title=About the City - History|url=http://www.cityofcalapan.gov.ph/Aboutthecity.html|publisher=Calapan City Government|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218132029/http://cityofcalapan.gov.ph/Aboutthecity.html|archive-date=February 18, 2009|access-date=May 17, 2009}}</ref>

In the early 18th century, the town only occupied a strip of land stretching from Ibaba to Ilaya in a cross-shape facing the present [[Calapan Cathedral|Santo Niño Cathedral]] and cut off by the river. Later on, succeeding barriers were founded.

In 1837, the capital of the province was moved from [[Puerto Galera]] to Calapan. When Mindoro became a part of [[Marinduque]] on June 13, 1902, the provincial capital was once again moved to Puerto Galera. On November 10, 1902, Mindoro was detached from Marinduque. In 1903, Calapan once again became the provincial capital.<ref name="history" />

When Mindoro was detached from Marinduque on November 10, 1902, Baco, Puerto Galera and San Teodoro were annexed to Calapan in 1905 under Act No. 1280, adding a total area of {{convert|843|km2}} of land.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative%2Bissuances/Act%20No.%201280|title=An Act Reducing the Fifteen Municipalities of the Province of Mindoro to Eight|chamber=Act|number=1280|date=1905-01-04|publisher=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court E-Library]]|accessdate=2023-12-03}}</ref> In 1902, under Act No. 2824, the three municipalities gained their independence.

In 1919, the boundary dispute between Calapan and [[Naujan]] was adjudicated by ''Presidentes'' (Mayors) Agustin Quijano of Calapan and Agustin Garong of Naujan over a portion of the territory of what is now the present boundary. The agricultural area was awarded to Naujan, thus making the area of Calapan much smaller compared to that of Naujan, which is now considered the biggest municipality in the province.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
In the year 1998, Calapan was converted from a municipality into a component city by virtue of Republic Act No. 8475.<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/15136|title=Charter of the City of Calapan|chamber=RA|number=8475|date=1998-02-02|publisher=[[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court E-Library]]|accessdate=2023-12-03}}</ref> The law was authored in Congress by Rep. Renato V. Leviste and was signed by President [[Fidel Ramos]] on February 2, 1998. On March 21, 1998, the people of Calapan ratified the creation of the City of Calapan in a plebiscite marking that same day as the city's foundation day. Incumbent Mayor Arnan C. Panaligan became the last Municipal Mayor and the first City Mayor of Calapan. To date, it is the first and only city in the whole island of Mindoro.<ref name="history" />

Calapan was reclassified from a 4th class city in 2007 to a 3rd class city in 2010, on account of its innovations in public service, modernization programs, increased revenue collection, and overall economic improvement.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

==Geography==
Calapan is bounded to the north and north-east by the Calapan Bay, south and southeast by [[Naujan, Oriental Mindoro|Naujan]], and to the west by the [[Baco, Oriental Mindoro|Baco]]. The city lies at the quadrangle bounded by 13°12.6 and 13°27’ north latitudes and 121°17’ east longitudes. It is approximately {{convert|28|nmi}} from the nearest point of [[Batangas]], {{convert|45|km}} south of Batangas City and {{convert|130|km}} south of [[Manila]].

The city has an area of {{convert|250.06|km2|abbr=on}} and is composed of 62 [[barangay]]s of which 22 are classified as urban and 40, rural.  The city also has jurisdiction over the [[Baco Islands]] and the two Silonay Islets on Calapan Bay.

The overall land characteristic is a wide plain with rivers, interspersed with wetlands at the seacoast periphery. The highest elevation is {{convert|187|m|abbr=on}} above sea level at Bulusan Hill, a {{convert|6|km|adj=on}} long [[landform]] east of the city, which interrupts the mostly flat terrain north-east of the Halcon-Baco Mountain Range.

===Barangays===
Calapan is divided into 62 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

These barangays are grouped into congressional districts where each district is represented by a congressman in the country's House of Representatives.

The city's economy is dependent on agriculture and fishing. However, a growing industry in machinery and tourism has contributed well to the city's annual income, making it one of the fastest growing new cities in the country for the last 10 years.

Since 1998, the city has experienced rapid development. The establishment of a special development area, particularly an eco-zone for light industries located at the Urban Development Area (Lumangbayan and Guinobatan), has been promoted and now serves as growth area which generates employment and spurs economic opportunities. Such industries focus on agro-industrial based activities such as food processing, handicraft making, furniture making and other related activities.

Calapan plays a major role in the Philippine economy as one of the major food suppliers in the country. The city is also a major exporter of rice supplying to [[Metro Manila]] and major parts of [[Luzon]] making it both an agriculturally-progressive and urbanized city. The five major crops are [[rice]], [[citrus]], [[banana]], [[rambutan]] and [[lanzones]]. The top five industries in Calapan are trading, tourism, services, marine and aquatic, and food processing.

Calapan serves as the province's industrial hub. It plays a pivotal role in the economic development of the province and its adjacent areas.

===Trade and commerce===
Trading and commercial activities are mainly confined in wholesale and retail trade. Other thriving industries are manufacturing, financing, tourism, food and beverages and services. In recent years, the city has witnessed the influx of private investments that increase income and employment opportunities.
