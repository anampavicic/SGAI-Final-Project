'''Sariaya''' ({{IPA|tl|sɐɾˈjajɐ|}}), officially the '''Municipality of Sariaya''' ({{lang-tgl|Bayan ng Sariaya}}),  is a 1st class [[municipalities of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Quezon]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 161,868 people making it the second most populous in Quezon Province after the capital city of [[Lucena]].{{PH census|current}}

As the only Mount Banahaw town in both Quezon and Laguna Provinces that has a sea coast, the town is famous for its pristine beach resorts and nature-trekking activities that lead adventurous hikers to the peak of mythical [[Mount Banahaw]]. With more than a hundred of [[List of Cultural Properties of the Philippines in Sariaya, Quezon|cultural properties]] and ancestral houses mostly built in Art Deco architecture within the municipality, Sariaya is considered as the '''Heritage Town of Quezon''' and the '''[[Art Deco]] Capital of Southern Luzon'''.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/video/newstogo/348343/sariaya-quezon-itinuturing-na-art-deco-capital-of-southern-luzon-dahil-sa-heritage-houses/video|title=Sariaya, Quezon itinuturing na Art Deco Capital of Southern Luzon dahil sa heritage houses|work=GMA News}}</ref> This heritage town has been branded by various cultural experts as a 'cultural gem worthy of a [[UNESCO]] designation.' The local government of the municipality with the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts of the Philippines]] were designated to work for the heritage town's inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List.

With the 2020 census population of almost reaching 161,000, Sariaya is the most populous municipality in the province of [[Quezon]] and the 19th most populous municipality in the [[Philippines]]. Cityhood might be coming to Sariaya in a matter of years.

==Etymology==
The origin of the word '''Sariaya''' was allegedly came from the word '''Sadyaya''' — one of the town's numerous rivers, but words of the great ancestors and legends have it that it was named after '''Saria''', a supposedly 'illiterate' (according to the [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) woman who encountered the first Spaniards in the town who were asking the name of the settlement. Saria can't understand the question as it was in Spanish, which was foreign and unknown to everyone in the area during that time. She was thus branded as illiterate by the Spanish despite being highly educated through Tagalog traditional knowledge. The woman gave her name as answer to the Spanish, assuming that they were asking her name. The Spaniards wrote "Saria" on their notebooks as the name of the settlement. And while the Spaniards were talking with each other, the natives heard them utter the words "Saria-ya". Hence, the words traveled from mouth to mouth and became a common saying until the two words were combined.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sariaya, Quezon (History, People, Places, About, Facts)|url=http://www.wowquezon.com/towns-and-cities/sariaya-quezon-history-people-places-about-facts/|access-date=April 26, 2017|publisher=WowQuezon}}</ref>

==History==
The beginning of Sariaya's documented history occurred with the arrival of Augustinian missionary priests in a Malay seaside settlement in what is now Barangay Castañas on the shores of Tayabas Bay. They discovered a thriving native people who were heathen, and they converted the majority of them to Christianity. 

After years of Tayabas rule, Sariaya obtained freedom in 1631 and fled north to avoid the destructive flame-throwing loot of the Moro pirates.

A strong earthquake in 1743 caused the bell tower of the Tumbaga church to collapse.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Very strong mag. 6.0 earthquake - Philippines September 1743 |url=https://www.volcanodiscovery.com/earthquakes/quake-info/8926614/mag6quake-Sep-1-1743-Philippines-Leyte.html |access-date=June 1, 2024 |website=VolcanoDiscovery.com}}</ref> As a result, the fragile southwest ridge of Mount Banahaw's crater lake collapsed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Banahaw |url=https://volcano.si.edu/volcano.cfm?vn=273050 |access-date=June 1, 2024 |website=Global Volcanism Program}}</ref> Then, this ancient community is referred to as "Lumangbayan," or Old Town. Given this, the surviving settlers were left with little choice but to relocate and travel far north in quest of a new, safer place.

The contemporary town of Sariaya is perfectly situated to see all the activity down along the Tayabas Bay coastline, with a clear view of the coastline to the south.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ongpin-Periquet |first=Lisa |date=May 25, 2024 |title=Sariaya: A town of heritage enthusiasts |url=https://philstarlife.com/living/654755-sariaya-town-heritage-enthusiasts |access-date=June 1, 2024 |website=Philippine Star Life}}</ref>

Furthermore, compared to the stone church of Tumbaga, a more durable combination of materials was used in the construction of the current church. These components consist of bricks, adobe blocks, albumin or egg white, stones, and masonry. In addition to being a house of worship, the church and its four-story belfry served as a lookout point for the surrounding fields and mountains as well as a citadel or last line of defense for the residents in the unlikely event that invaders managed to get past all of the defenses and into the town.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ABOUT SARIAYA |url=https://www.sariaya.gov.ph/2020/10/12/about-sariaya/ |access-date=June 1, 2024 |website=Official Website of Sariaya Quezon}}</ref>

Sariaya is fostering relations with global communities after joining the Santa Clarita Sister Cities program in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sariaya, Philippines |url=https://santaclaritasistercities.org/sariaya-philippines/ |access-date=June 1, 2024 |website=Santa Clarita Sister Cities Official Website}}</ref>

On May 17, 1902, [[Candelaria, Quezon|Candelaria]] was merged with Sariaya by virtue of Act No. 402.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=402|title=An Act Consolidating the Municipalities of Tiaon, Dolores, Candelaria, and Sariaya in the Province of Tayabas Into Two Municipalities|url=https://issuances-library.senate.gov.ph/legislative-issuance/act-no-402|date=May 17, 1902|accessdate=September 21, 2024|publisher=Senate of the Philippines Legislative Digital Library}}</ref> On September 20, 1907, Candelaria was separated from the municipality to regain its independent status.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=1721|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l40d0|date=September 20, 1907|title=An Act Increasing the Number of Municipalities in the Province of Tayabas From Twenty-four to Twenty-six, by Organizing the Barrio of Candelaria, Now a Part of Sariaya, Into a New Municipality, and Separating From Baler the Former Municipality of Casiguran, Giving the Latter the Same Territory Which It Comprised Prior to the Passage of Act Numbered Fifteen Hundred and Fifty|accessdate=September 21, 2024|publisher=Lawyerly}}</ref>

==Culture==
* '''[[Agawan Festival]]'''

[[File:Bagakay of Agawan Festival.jpeg|thumb|right|Bagakays]]

Celebrated every 15th day of May, this religious festivity pays tribute to San Isidro Labrador, the patron saint of farmers. This much-anticipated feast has close affinity with the 'Pahiyas Festival' of [[Lucban, Quezon]]. Pliant bamboo treetops and trellises (bagakay) weighed down by succulent fruits, native candies, rice cakes, and colorful rice krispies called "kiping" are deliberately pulled down on the streets by noisy merrymakers right after the afternoon procession. Festival revelers from the town's barangays, neighboring towns, and other provinces would then scramble to gather as many treats as they can snatch and carry, hence the term "Agawan."

* '''Town Fiesta'''
[[File:Santo Cristo de Burgos.jpg|thumbnail|right|Santo Cristo de Burgos]]

On September 14, pious devotees from far and wide pay homage to the miraculous image of the Santo Cristo de Burgos during the Feast of the Exaltation of the Cross. The Catholic feast is a day-long veneration of the replica of the Crucified Christ at the ancient Cathedral of [[Burgos, Spain]] long believed to be a gift of [[Philip V of Spain|King Philip V]] of [[Spain]] in 1703 to the people of Lumangbayan in Sariaya. People from far-flung barangays flock to the Poblacion to attend the packed fiesta Masses. They also sell their farm products and handicrafts in the public market as they eagerly sample the gaudily-decorated and crowded venue for the annual "perya" (fiesta fair) for thrilling rides, occasional circus performances, and shows featuring human mutants, trained animals performing tricks, vendors peddling herbal medicines, and "peryantes," those hardy and itinerant peddlers of cheap clothing, toys, and kitchen utensils. The town's basketball tournament also holds its cherished championship game on the eve of this much-awaited day. Sometimes there are hired stage performances at the town plaza that feature some of the nation's stage, television and film celebrities as well as musical stars.

[[File:St Francis of Assisi Church (Sariaya).jpg|thumbnail|right|Sariaya Church built in 1748]]

===Heritage houses===

On May 14, 2008, the [[National Historical Institute|National Historical Institute (NHI)]] unveiled markers of heritage houses for the three ancient yet still stately mansions at the heart of Sariaya town. These venerable houses are best viewed from the south, as they are silhouetted against the majestic and mystical Mount Banahaw, Quezon's long-dormant volcano. Cultural recognition was bestowed on three ancestral houses, namely:  The Enriquez-Gala mansion, owned by former Tayabas (now Quezon) Gov. Natalio Enriquez and Susana Gala; the [[Gala-Rodriguez Ancestral House (Sariaya)|Gala-Rodriguez house]] of Dr. Isidro Rodriguez and Gregoria Gala, and the house of [[Don Catalino Rodriguez Ancestral House (Villa Sariaya)|Catalino and Luisa Rodriguez also known as Villa Sariaya]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Mallari Jr.|first=Delfin|title=History lives in Sariaya mansions|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20081016-166624/History-lives-in-Sariaya-mansions|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|access-date=May 14, 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229124913/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/inquirerheadlines/regions/view/20081016-166624/History-lives-in-Sariaya-mansions|archive-date=December 29, 2013}}</ref>

===Tumbaga Church ruins===
[[File:Tumbaga Church ruins in Sariaya, Quezon by JC.jpg|thumbnail|right|Extant wall of Tumbaga Church ruins]]

Remains of an early 18th-century stone church and former town site of Sariaya, located at Barangay Tumbaga I. The settlement was inaugurated in 1703 with Father Lucas Fernandez as first parish priest and Francisco Argente as ''Presidente del Pueblo''. The church, which measured {{convert|500|sqm|sp=us}}, served a recorded population of 3000 parishioners. Two events led to the abandonment of the town site: the earthquake of 1743 which consequently destroyed the church's bell tower, and the Moro raids which left the town site in ruins after being razed by fire. The venerated image of '''Santo Cristo de Burgos''' is said to have been enshrined in the church before it was transferred to its present shrine in the [[Saint Francis of Assisi Parish Church|San Francisco Church]] in the present-day town proper of Sariaya. The unscathed image was said have been retrieved from the burnt church after the Muslim raider attack. The church is believed to be the fourth church structure built by the Spanish Franciscan Friars in Sariaya.<ref name="Sariaya Mag">{{cite journal|last1=San Jose-Valdoria|first1=Nancy|title=Tumbaga: Unang "Pueblo", 1703-1743|journal=Sariaya Community Magazine|date=November–December 2001|volume=2|issue=7|pages=20–22}}</ref>
