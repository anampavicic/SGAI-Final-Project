==History==

=== Medieval History ===
Since Silchar was only founded after the introduction of the British in 1832, the pre-colonial history of Silchar can be approximated through the history of the region and nearby areas.

==== Tippera, Koch, and Dimasa rule ====
[[Cachar district|Cachar]] district, whose headquarters is in Silchar, was ruled by the [[Manikya dynasty|Tippera dynasty]] in the 13th century.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal|last=Choudhury|first=Mohammad Nizamuddin|title=Influence of Persian culture in Assam: a case study of the Barak Valley|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/114444|access-date=19 October 2020|journal=University|date=31 December 2011 |hdl=10603/114444}}</ref> The initial capital of the kingdom was in Khalangsha in Cachar, which has been identified as Rajghat village in [[Sonai]], 18&nbsp;km from Silchar.<ref name=":7">{{cite web|last=Bhattacharjee|first=Jayanta Bhusan|title=Cachar under British Rule in North East India|url=http://www.dspace.nehu.ac.in/bitstream/1/10863/1/Cachar%20under%20British%20rule%20(JB%20Bhattacharjee).pdf|access-date=19 October 2020|website=North-Eastern Hill University Institutional Repository}}</ref> The Tippera eventually moved eastwards to present day Tripura. By the 16th century, Cachar was a part of the Tripura kingdom.

The Tippera kings continued their rule in Barak Valley till mid-16th century, when commander [[Chilarai]] of the [[Koch dynasty|Koch]] dynasty defeated the king of Tripura in 1562 in Longai.<ref name=":7" /> Longai became the boundary between the Tripura and Koch kingdoms. Bir Chilarai, also known as Shukladhwaja, was the younger brother of the Koch king [[Nara Narayan|Naranarayan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History Book of Cooch Behar|url=http://coochbehar.nic.in/htmfiles/history_book.html|access-date=19 October 2020|website=coochbehar.nic.in}}</ref> Gosai Kamal, also known as Kamal Narayan, was another brother of Naranarayan. He was made the governor of Barak Valley and ruled the area from Khaspur, 20&nbsp;km away from Silchar.<ref name=":2" />

Even after the collapse of the Koch kingdom elsewhere, the Koch continued ruling Cachar from Khaspur.<ref name=":3">{{cite web|last=Sen|first=Kalpana|title=History of Religions in Barak Valley from 7th to 18th century CE|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/92851|access-date=19 October 2020|website=Shodhganga|hdl=10603/92851}}</ref> The area was ruled by seven more Koch kings after Gosai Kamal: Udita Singha, Dhir Singha, Mehendra Singha, Ranjit Singha, Nara Singha and Bhim Singha.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kingdoms of South Asia - Indian Kingdoms of Assam|url=https://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/IndiaKacharis.htm|access-date=19 October 2020|website=www.historyfiles.co.uk}}</ref>  Bhim Singha, the last Koch Raja of Khaspur, only had a daughter called Kanchani who was married off to Prince Laksmichandra of the [[Dimasa Kingdom|Kachari Dimasa]] kingdom of [[Maibang]] in 1745.<ref name=":3" />  Maibang is in present-day hill district of [[Dima Hasao district|Dima Hasao]], adjacent to Cachar. Laksmichandra was made the governor of a part of the kingdom which is still named after him - [[Lakhipur]], situated 25&nbsp;km away from Silchar. Laksmichandra became the Raja after Bhim Singha's death and eventually the two kingdoms were merged and present day Cachar came under Dimasa rule.<ref name=":7" /> Under the Dimasa kings, Cachar witnessed attacks from the [[Mughals]], the [[Jaintia Kingdom|Jaintias]], the [[Manipur (princely state)|Manipuri kings]], the [[Burmese Kingdom|Burmese]], and the [[Ahom kingdom|Ahoms]].<ref name=":7" /><ref name=":8">{{cite web|last=Choudhury|first=Joya|title=Economic Contents of Decline of the Dimasa State (1773-1830)|url=http://dspace.nehu.ac.in/bitstream/1/8387/1/J%20CHOUDRY.pdf|access-date=19 October 2020|website=North-Eastern Hill University Institutional Repository}}</ref>

==== Bengali presence in the Kachari Kingdom ====
While the hill areas of the Kachari kingdom i.e. Dima Hasao, had a [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]] stronghold, the plain areas i.e. present day Cachar had [[Bengalis]] constituting the majority.<ref name=":3" /> While Bengalis had been inhabiting Cachar before the Koch rule, the Dimasa kings encouraged increased migration of Bengalis from nearby areas as priests, cultivators, and ministers at court.<ref name=":7" /> Eventually, the formal conversion of Dimasa kings into Hinduism was carried out under [[Bengali Brahmins]] when Raja Krishna Chandra and Raja Govinda Chandra performed the [[Hiranyagarbha (donation)|Hiranyagarbha]] ceremony in 1790.<ref name=":6">{{cite web|last=Bhattacharjee|first=Shatarupa|title=Cachar under Raja Govinda Chandra 1813-1830|url=https://shodhganga.inflibnet.ac.in/handle/10603/98695|access-date=19 October 2020|website=Shodhganga|hdl=10603/98695}}</ref>

The kings in turn were great patrons of [[Bengali literature]]; Bengali was the court language of the Kachari kings, translation of Sanskrit texts into Bengali was carried out, and the kings themselves composed prose and poetry in Bengali.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dey|first=Tanima|title=Making of Bengali Literary Culture in the 18th Century: The Case of Cachar and Tripura|url=http://www.jneis.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/9.2.2.pdf|access-date=19 October 2020|website=Journal of North East India Studies}}</ref> In fact some of the only surviving written examples of the Bengali tradition in later 18th and early 19th century Cachar are the 27 letters written by Raja Krishna Chandra and Raja Gobinda Chandra to the [[East India Company]].<ref name=":6" />

==== Burmese Invasion and the Treaty of Badarpur ====
After taking over parts of the [[Brahmaputra Valley]] and Manipur by 1823, the Burmese made forays into Cachar as well.<ref name=":9">{{Cite book|last1=Myint-U|first1=Thant|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gMH_GlTgftcC&pg=PA24|title=The Making of Modern Burma|last2=Thant|first2=Myint-U.|date=26 March 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-79914-0|language=en}}</ref> The then Governor General of India, [[William Amherst, 1st Earl Amherst|Lord William Amherst]], saw the British occupation of Cachar as essential towards guarding the nearby British held district of [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] from the Burmese.<ref name=":10">{{cite web|last=Singh|first=Leishangthem Chandramani|title=British relations with Manipur 1824 1891|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10603/67716|access-date=19 October 2020|website=Shodhganga|hdl=10603/67716}}</ref> On 6 March 1824, Gobinda Chandra signed the Treaty of Badarpur with the British, who declared Cachar as a [[British protectorate]] and recognised Raja Gobinda Chandra as the ruler of Cachar.<ref name=":2" />

The Burmese army attacked Cachar in 1824 and the British declared war on them. Eventually, the two armies clashed in the Burmese stronghold of Dudpatil, 15&nbsp;km from Silchar and the British were able to drive the Burmese away to Manipur in 1825.<ref name=":10" /> The clash in Cachar was the start of the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]], which ended with the [[Treaty of Yandabo]], wherein the [[Kingdom of Ava]] agreed to stop attacking Cachar, amongst other areas.<ref name=":9" /><ref name=":10" /> Gobinda Chandra was reinstated on the throne but had to pay an annual tribute of Rs.10,000 to the British as per the Treaty of Badarpur, which adversely affected the post-Burmese occupation Cachar's economy.<ref name=":8" />

Gobinda Chandra was assassinated without any heir on 24 April 1830.<ref name=":10" /> Though [[Chinglen Nongdrenkhomba|Gambhir Singh]] of Manipur, who was suspected to be behind the assassination, laid claim on Cachar, it passed onto British hands as per the Treaty of Badarpur.<ref name=":10" /><ref>{{cite web|last=Bhattacharjee|first=Jayanta Bhusan.|title=The Nature of British Objection to the Trade Monopoly of the Raja of Cachar (1827-1830)|url=http://14.139.207.116/bitstream/1/10546/1/The%20nature%20%28JB%20Bhattacharjee%29.pdf|access-date=20 October 2020|website=North-Eastern Hill University Institutional Repository}}</ref> Captain Thomas Fisher, an army officer took charge of Cachar on 30 June 1830 with the headquarters in [[Cherrapunji]].

==== Foundation of Silchar ====
There is no mention of any place called 'Silchar' before the annexation of Cachar.<ref name=":16">{{cite web|last=Sultana|first=Kismat|title=Silchar Municipality: A study of its origin and development 1882 - 1990|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10603/92989|access-date=21 October 2020|website=Shodhganga|hdl=10603/92989}}</ref> Its constituent areas such as Tarapur, Ambikapur, Kanakpur, and Rangpur have been mentioned as villages under Gobinda Chandra, but not 'Silchar'. The earliest mention of Silchar was in 1835 in a report by R.B.

In this respect, Captain Thomas Fisher was the founder of Silchar.<ref name=":16" /> The Sadar Station and the District Court are still located in and around present day Janiganj.

According to a theorist, Fisher's reasons for choosing Silchar as the administrative centre for Cachar included 'the strategic location of Silchar, its accessibility from [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]], availability of land and labour, approach routes to neighbouring hills and prospects of riverine commerce'.<ref name=":16" /> The establishment of the Sadar Station was followed by the construction of the treasury and a kutchery. A jail and a police outpost for the Sylhet Light Infantry was constructed in Fatak Bazar, while offices and residential quarters were made in Janiganj. Parts of Janiganj were also allotted to officers and traders.<ref name=":16" />

John Edgars, the successor to Captain Fisher, added to the urban growth of the city. He prepared a blueprint for the planned development of Silchar, paved the roads, and supervised the construction of office buildings, residential quarters, circuit house and the Deputy Commissioner's office.<ref name=":16" /> The latter two still survive. Under him, the jail was shifted from Fatak Bazar to its present site, and traders from nearby areas in Bengal were encouraged to settle in the town. Communication facilities were strengthened with the steamer service between Silchar and Kolkata in 1850, the establishment of the Head Post Office in 1852, and the introduction of telegraph in 1861. While Tarapur, Malugram and Itkhola were part of the older settled areas, newer localities such as Central Road, Nazirpatty, Premtola, Tulapatty, and Narshingtola emerged.<ref name=":16" />

==== Silchar under the British ====
Due to the initiatives of Captain Fisher, a medical centre was established in Silchar  in 1835, which became a hospital in 1864.<ref name=":16" /> The tea industry in Cachar was growing by 1855, which lead to Silchar's emergence as a centre of trade and commerce.<ref name=":16" /> The town got its first English education institution in 1863 when Reverend Pyrse started the High Grammar School, which later became the Government Boys Higher Secondary School.<ref name=":12" /> In 1864, a charitable dispensary was set up, which later became the Civil Hospital.<ref name=":14">{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Sujit K.|title=Beginning of Silchar Municipality|url=http://www.dspace.nehu.ac.in/bitstream/1/11289/1/Beginning%20(SK%20Ghosh).pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200706034946/http://www.dspace.nehu.ac.in/bitstream/1/11289/1/Beginning%20(SK%20Ghosh).pdf|archive-date=6 July 2020|access-date=21 October 2020}}</ref> Silchar got its very first body for self governance In 1882, when a Town Committee was established under the Bengal Municipal Act, 1876.<ref name=":14" /> Keating Library, the first library in Silchar, was established in 1876 and was renamed to Arun Chanda Granthagar after Independence.<ref name=":17">{{cite web|last=Roy|first=Monolina Nandy|title=Contradictions and conciliation between nationalism regionalism and localism the political response of Barak Valley to the colonial rule 1874 - 1947|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10603/93523|access-date=21 October 2020|website=Shodhganga|hdl=10603/93523}}</ref> The earliest newspaper in Cachar, called 'Silchar', appeared in 1883.

{{main|Bengali Language Movement (Barak Valley)}}

[[File:Silchar Language Marters.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|[[Silchar railway station|Silchar Railway Station]] is popularly known as Bhasa Shahid Station.]]

=== Climate ===
Silchar has a borderline [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am'') slightly too hot in the “winter” or “cool” season to qualify as a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa''). During this "cool" season the weather is generally warm and dry with cool to mild mornings; however, the “wet” season begins early as [[Monsoon of South Asia|the monsoon]] moves into the region during April, with the result that for seven months of the year Silchar has very hot and humid weather with heavy thunderstorms almost every afternoon until the middle of October, when there is usually a brief period of hot and relatively dry weather before the “cool” season sets in during November.{{citation needed|date=September 2020}}

=== Civic administration ===
Silchar Municipal Board is responsible for the municipal governance of the town.<ref>{{cite web|title=New website of Silchar Municipal Board launched|url=http://www.assamtribune.com/scripts/detailsnew.asp?id=jul2216/state050|access-date=9 April 2020|website=The Assam Tribune Online}}</ref> The municipal history of Silchar goes back to 1865 when the town was made a municipality under the Bengal District Town Improvement Act, 1864.<ref name=":14" /> The municipality was composed to 8 European and 3 Indian members, in addition to the chairperson and the vice-chairperson.<ref name=":16" /> This was later withdrawn in 1868.  In January 1882, Silchar got a Town Committee under the Bengal Municipal Act, 1876. Mr. Wright, the Deputy Commissioner, was the chairperson and Babu Jagat Bandhu Nag was elected by the committee members as the vice-chairperson. Silchar had been divided into four wards - Janiganj, Ambicapur, Tarapur, and Malugram - but each ward had only 20-50 voters.<ref name=":14" />

The Town Committee had limited powers to impose taxes, which constrained its funds and municipal activities. Yet it carried out some important activities: road construction, creating tanks and cleaning older ones, making public latrines, removable of 'objectional' houses such as distillery and slaughter houses out the town, and draining of swamps to prevent diseases.<ref name=":14" /> In 1891, on recommendation of the Deputy Commissioner to the Assam Government, Silchar was turned into a municipality.<ref name=":14" /> The first Municipal elections in Silchar were held in February 1900 but only 14.6% of the town was eligible to vote. 12 members were elected, who joined 2 ex-officio members and 6 nominated members to form the municipality. Of these 20 members, 16 were Indians and 4 were Europeans.<ref name=":14" />

From 1882 to 1912, the Deputy commissioners were the chairpersons of the municipality. The chairpersons began to be elected from 1913 onwards. Kamini Kumar Chanda and Mahesh Chandra Dutta were the first elected chairperson and vice-chairperson of the Silchar municipality.<ref name=":16" /> The municipality took decisions like construction and repair of roads, buying medicines and taking public health preventive steps, sanitation, and setting prices to guard again inflation. As the pro-Independence sentiments grew, the municipality started to participate as well; reception plans for the [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Viceroy Chelmsford]]'s visit to Silchar in 1919 were cancelled because of the [[Jallianwala Bagh massacre]], a resolution was passed after the death of [[Chittaranjan Das]] in 1925, and members of the municipality proposed a [[hartal]] to protest against the [[Simon Commission]]'s visit to India in 1928.<ref name=":16" /> In 1930, the then chairperson Dhirendra Kumar Gupta and member Satindra Mohan Deb were arrested because of their participation in the [[Civil disobedience movement|Civil Disobedience Movement]]. The municipality took out a resolution in July 1947 against including Cachar within Pakistan and sent a member to Kolkata to submit a memorandum in front of the Boundary Commission.<ref name=":16" />

By 1952, when the first post Independence municipal elections took place, Madhurban was added to the ward list and the town now had 5 wards in total. This period also saw the municipality giving over the control of the fire brigade to the state government, and donation  of land to establish educational institutes.

The area under the Silchar Municipal Board was 10&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in 1971 and 15.75&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> in 1971.<ref name=":19" />

Till 1975, the municipality had elected members, but from 1975 to 1979, a government Executive Officer was in charge.<ref name=":19" /> 1975 to 1984 saw an elected body preside over the municipal board, but from 1984, it has been run by state government appointees.
