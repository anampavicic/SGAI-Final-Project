It is situated on the northern coast ([[Pryazovia]]) of the [[Sea of Azov]], at the mouth of the [[Kalmius|Kalmius River]]. Prior to the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], it was the tenth-largest city in the country and the second-largest city in Donetsk Oblast, with an estimated population of 425,681 people in January 2022;<ref name="2022Estimate" /> Ukrainian authorities estimate the current population of Mariupol at approximately 120,000.<ref name=population/> Mariupol has been occupied by Russian forces since May 2022.

Historically, the city of Mariupol was a centre for trade and manufacturing, and played a key role in the development of higher education and many businesses and also served as a coastal resort on the Sea of Azov. In 1948, Mariupol was renamed '''Zhdanov''' ({{Langx|ru|Жданов}}) after [[Andrei Zhdanov]], a native of the city who had become a high-ranking official of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and a close ally to [[Joseph Stalin]]. The name was part of a larger effort to rename cities after high-ranking political figures in the [[Soviet Union]]. The historic name was restored in 1989.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mariupol |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Zhdanov,+Ukraine |publisher=The Free Dictionary |access-date=4 December 2014 |archive-date=2 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402074818/https://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Zhdanov,+Ukraine |url-status=live }}</ref>

It played a key role in [[History of the Soviet Union (1927–1953)|Stalin-era industrialization]]; it was a centre for grain trade, metallurgy, and heavy engineering—including the [[Illich Steel and Iron Works|Illich Iron and Steel Works]] and the [[Azovstal iron and steel works|Azovstal Iron and Steel Works]].

===Crimean Khanate===
[[File:Crimean Khanate 1600.gif|thumb|left|The [[Crimean Khanate]] in about 1600]]

From the 12th through the 16th century, the area around Mariupol was largely devastated and depopulated by intense conflict between the [[Crimean Tatars]], the [[Nogay Horde]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovy]]. By the middle of the 15th century much of the region north of the Black and Azov Seas was annexed by the [[Crimean Khanate]] and became a dependency of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. East of the [[Dnieper|Dnieper River]] a desolate [[steppe]] stretched to the Sea of Azov, where lack of water made early settlement precarious.<ref>LeDonne John P.

===Cossack period===
In this region of [[Eurasian Steppe|Eurasian steppes]], the [[Cossacks]] emerged as a distinct people in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. Below the [[Dnieper Rapids]] were the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], [[Filibuster (military)|freebooters]] organized into small, loosely-knit, and highly mobile groups who were both [[Pastoral farming|livestock farmers]] and [[nomad]]s. The Cossacks would regularly penetrate the steppe to fish and hunt, as well as for migratory farming and to herd livestock. Their independence from governmental and landowner authority attracted to join them many peasants and serfs fleeing the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]].{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

The [[Treaty of Constantinople (1700)|Treaty of Constantinople]] in 1700 further isolated the region, as it stipulated that there should be no settlements or fortifications on the coast of the Azov Sea to the mouth of the [[Mius River]]. In 1709, in response to a Cossack alliance with [[Sweden]] against Russia, Tsar [[Peter the Great]] ordered the [[liquidation of the Zaporozhian Sich]], and their complete and permanent expulsion from the area.<ref>Magocsi, Paul R. "A History of Ukraine: The Land and Its Peoples," p. 197.</ref> In 1733, Russia was preparing for a [[Russo-Turkish War (1735–1739)|new military campaign]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and therefore allowed the return of the Zaporozhians, although the territory officially belonged to Turkey.<ref name="Vasylenko 1775 p. 16">N.

Under the Agreement of [[Lubny]] of 1734, the Zaporozhians regained all their former lands, and in return, were to serve in the Russian army in war. They were also permitted to build a new stockade{{Clarify|date=April 2022|reason=seems to be a contradiction as the stockade article says it has a defensive wall whereas this sentence says no fortifications}} on the [[Dnieper River]] called [[New Sich]], though the terms prohibited them from erecting fortifications. These terms allowed only for living quarters, in Ukrainian called ''kureni''.<ref name="Vasylenko 1775 p. 16" />

Upon their return, the Zaporozhian population in these lands was extremely sparse, so effort to establish a measure of control, they introduced a structure of districts or palankas.<ref>Magocsi, Paul R. 2010.

After the [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)|Russo-Turkish War]] from 1768 to 1774, the governor of the [[Azov Governorate]], Vasily A.

In 1782, Mariupol was an administrative seat of its [[uyezd|county]] in the Azov Governorate of the [[Russian Empire]], with 2,948 inhabitants. In the early 19th century, a customs house, a church-parish school, a port authority building, a county religious school, and two privately founded girls' schools were built. By the 1850s the population had grown to 4,600 and the city had 120 shops and 15 wine cellars. In 1869, consuls and vice-consuls of Prussia, Sweden, Norway, Austria-Hungary, the Roman States, Italy, and France established their representative offices in Mariupol.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ri-urbanhistory.org.ua/library/konstantinova-liman/European_Vector_of_the_Northern_Azov.%20British%20Consular%20Reports.pdf|title=Victoria Konstantinova, Igor Lyman, Anastasiya Ignatova, European Vector of the Northern Azov in the Imperial Period: British Consular Reports about Italian Shipping (Berdiansk: Tkachuk O.V., 2016), 184 p.|access-date=17 January 2019|archive-date=31 March 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220331225125/http://ri-urbanhistory.org.ua/library/konstantinova-liman/European_Vector_of_the_Northern_Azov.%20British%20Consular%20Reports.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Igor Lyman, Victoria Konstantinova.

After the construction of the railway line from [[Donetsk|Yuzovka]] (later Stalino and Donetsk) to Mariupol in 1882, much of the wheat grown in the [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]] and coal from the [[Donets Basin]] were exported via the port of Mariupol (the second largest in the South Russian Empire after [[Odesa]]), which served as a key funding source for opening a hospital, public library, electric power station and urban water supply system.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

Mariupol remained a local trading centre until 1898, when the Belgian subsidiary ''SA Providence Russe'' opened a steelworks in [[Sartana, Ukraine|Sartana]], a village near Mariupol (now the [[Ilyich Steel & Iron Works]]).

{{Anchor|Russian occupation of Mariupol}}In the months after they took control of the city, Russian authorities had many damaged buildings torn down, sometimes evicting the remaining residents. Some new housing was also built. [[Associated Press]] described this ongoing process as an effort to "eradicat[e] all vestiges of Ukraine" and to cover up "the evidence of war crimes". Local schools started using a Russian curriculum, the television and radio broadcasts switched to Russian, and many street names were replaced by their [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-era names.<ref>

In August 2023, the [[Institute for the Study of War]] reported that the Ukrainian Resistance Center had claimed to have gained access to documents detailing Russian plans to conduct a decade-long ethnic cleansing campaign in occupied Mariupol. The ISW reported that the depopulation of Ukrainians through deportation and Russian efforts to attract Russian citizens to move to the city is likely to be an ethnic cleansing campaign in addition to being apparent violations of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.<ref name="Institute for the Study of War 2023 j069">{{cite web | title=Russian Offensive Campaign Assesment, August 20, 2023 | website=Institute for the Study of War | date=20 August 2023 | url=https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-20-2023 | access-date=24 August 2023 | archive-date=3 September 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230903083846/https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-august-20-2023 | url-status=live }}</ref>

This process has included demolishing many damaged buildings, whose remaining residents are sometimes not allowed into the rebuilt buildings, and are offered new property further from the city centre with little compensation. Property prices are similar to before the war, with the Russian government maintaining mortgages at 2% to draw in Russian buyers. According to a Ukrainian official, they  number around 80,000 as of mid-2024. In early 2024 the Russian government began a process to seize properties from those who had fled, requiring owners to obtain Russian citizenship and re-register properties with Russian authorities in person in order to keep them. 514 apartments were declared ownerless in May.<ref name=crime>{{cite news |url=https://www.economist.com/europe/2024/06/19/russias-latest-crime-in-mariupol-stealing-property |title=Russia's latest crime in Mariupol: stealing property |newspaper=The Economist |date=19 June 2024 |access-date=20 June 2024}}</ref>

== Geography ==
Mariupol is located in the south of the [[Donetsk Oblast]], on the coast of [[Sea of Azov]] and at the mouth of [[Kalmius River]]. It is located in an area of the Azov Lowland that is an extension of the Ukrainian [[Black Sea Lowland]]. To the east of Mariupol is the Khomutov Steppe, which is also part of the Azov Lowland, located on the border with Russia.

The city occupies an area of {{cvt|166|sqkm}}, or {{cvt|244|km2}} including suburbs administered by the city council. The downtown area is {{cvt|106|km2}}, while the area of parks and gardens is {{cvt|80.6|km2}}.

The city is mainly built on land made of [[solonetz]]ic (sodium enriched) [[chernozem]], with a significant amount of underground subsoil water, that frequently leads to landslides.

=== Climate ===
Mariupol has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') with warm summers and cold winters. The average annual precipitation is {{convert|511|mm|in|0}}. Agroclimatic conditions allow the cultivation of warmth-loving agricultural crops with long vegetative periods (sunflower, melons, grapes, etc.). However water resources in the region are insufficient, so ponds and water basins are used for the needs of the population and industry.

In winter, the wind blows mainly from the east, and in summer the north.

=== Ecology ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
[[File:Pollution mar.jpg|thumb|Air pollution levels in Mariupol]]
Mariupol has historically led Ukraine in the volume of emissions of harmful substances by industrial enterprises. The city's leading enterprises have begun to address these ecological problems, so, over the last 15 years, industrial emissions have fallen to nearly a half of their previous levels.

Due to stable production by the majority of the large industrial enterprises, the city constantly experiences environmental problems. At the end of the 1970s, Zhdanov (Mariupol) ranked third in the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] (after [[Novokuznetsk]] and [[Magnitogorsk]]) in the quantity of industrial emissions. In 1989, including all enterprises, the city had 5,215 sources of atmospheric pollution producing 752,900 tons of harmful substances a year (about 98% from metallurgical enterprises and Mariupol Coke-Chemical Plant "Markokhim"). Even after Ukraine regained independence in 1991, by the mid-1990s many pollution limits were still exceeded:
* 1.3 times for [[ammonia]]
* 1.3 times for [[phenol]]
* 2.0 times for [[formaldehyde]]
In the residential areas adjoining the industrial giants, concentrations of [[benzopyrene]] reach 6–9 times the maximum concentration limits; [[hydrogen fluoride]], ammonia, and formaldehyde reach 2–3 to 5 times the maximum concentration limits; dust and oxides of carbon, and [[hydrogen sulphide]] are 6–8 times the maximum concentration limits; and dioxides of nitrogen are 2–3 times the maximum concentration limits. The maximum concentration limit has been exceed on phenol by 17x, and on benzapiren by 13-14x.

[[File:UN SDGs consulltations in Mariupol (29607073140).jpg|thumb|United Nations [[Sustainable Development Goals]] consultations in Mariupol, September 2016]]

Ill-considered locations of the [[Azovstal iron and steel works|Azovstal]] and Markokhim to economize on transport charges, during both construction in the 1930s and subsequent operations, have led to extensive wind-borne emissions into the central areas of Mariupol. Wind intensity and geographical "flatness" offer relief from the accumulation of long-standing pollutants, somewhat easing the problem.

The nearby [[Sea of Azov]] is in distress. The fish catch in the area has been reduced by orders of magnitude over the last 30–40 years.

The environmental protection activity of the leading industrial enterprises in Mariupol costs millions of hrivnas, but it appears to have little effect on the city's long-standing environmental problems.

Mariupol is divided into four neighborhoods or "raions".
*[[Kalmiuskyi District]] ([[decommunization in Ukraine|until June 2016]] named Illichivsk District after Vladimir ''Ilyich'' Lenin<ref name="zakon4.rada.gov.ua">{{in lang|uk}} [http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/v0180359-16 On Amending Resolution of the Central Election Commission on April 28, 2012 № 82] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215121757/http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/laws/show/v0180359-16 |date=15 December 2018 }}, [[Verkhovna Rada]] (3 June 2016)</ref>) is the northern part of the city, the largest and most industrialized neighborhood in the city. It is commonly known as the Zavod ("Factory") of Ilyich.
*[[Livoberezhnyi District]] ([[decommunization in Ukraine|until June 2016]] named after [[Sergo Ordzhonikidze]]<ref name="zakon4.rada.gov.ua" />) is the eastern part of the city, on the left bank of the Kalmius River. Its name means the "Left Bank".
*[[Prymorskyi District, Mariupol|Prymorskyi District]] is the southern area of the city, on the coast of the Azov Sea. The everyday name of the central part this neighbourhood is simply "the [[seaport|Port]]".
*[[Tsentralnyi District, Mariupol|Tsentralnyi District]] is the central city raion. Its everyday name is simply "the Centre" or "the City". Formerly it was known as Zhovtnevyi District (October District) commemorating the 1917 [[Bolshevik revolution]].
[[File:Mariupol P.Nilsen's house.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[House of the weeping nymphs|Nilsen mansion]], built {{circa|1900}}]]

The [[Kalmius]] River separates the Livoberezhnyi District from the remaining three districts. The population is mostly concentrated in the Tsentralnyi and Prymorskyi Districts. The Kalmiuskyi District houses the large [[Illich Steel and Iron Works]] and the Azovmash [[manufacturing plant]]. The Livoberezhnyi (Left Bank) is home to the Azovstal metallurgic combine and the Koksokhim (Coke and Chemical) factory. The settlements of [[Staryi Krym]] and [[Sartana]] are located in close proximity to the city limits of Mariupol (see map).

=== Coat of arms ===
The modern [[coat of arms]] of Mariupol was confirmed in 1989. It is described in heraldic terms as: ''Per fess wavy argent and azure, on an anchor or, accompanied by the figure 1778 of the last''. The gold [[anchor]] has a ring on top. The number 1778 indicates the year of the city's founding. The [[Argent (heraldry)|argent]] represents steel; the [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]], the sea; the anchor, the port; and the ring, metallurgy.

=== City holidays ===
Holidays exclusive to Mariupol include:

* Day of liberation of the city from fascist aggressors (on 10 September)
* Day of the city (the Sunday after the day of liberation of Mariupol in September)
* Day of the metallurgist – a professional holiday for many citizens
* Day of the machine engineer
* Day of the seaman and other professional holidays

Over the last century the population has grown nearly twelvefold. The city is populated by [[Ukrainians]], [[Russians]], [[Pontic Greeks]] (including [[Caucasus Greeks]] and Tatar- and Turkish-speaking but Greek Orthodox Christian [[Urums]]), [[Belarusians]], [[Armenians]], [[Jews]], etc. The main language is Russian.

[[File:Density mar.png|thumb|Mariupol population density]]

The population fell precipitously as the result of the [[siege of Mariupol|siege of the city]] in 2022. Per Ukrainian sources it was 120 thousand in 2023, while according to Russian administration the city population was approximately 280 thousand.<ref name="population">{{cite news |title=Invaders develop 10-year plan for ethnic cleansing in Mariupol, replacing population with Russians – ISW |url=https://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/930023.html |access-date=20 January 2024 |publisher=Interfax-Ukraine |date=21 August 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Пушилин оценил численность населения Мариуполя |url=https://ria.ru/20230320/mariupol-1859096502.html |access-date=20 January 2024 |publisher=RIA |date=20 March 2023 |language=ru}}</ref>

=== Ethnic structure ===
The city is largely and traditionally [[Russophone|Russian-speaking]], while ethnically the population is divided about evenly between Ukrainians and Russians. There is also a significant ethnic [[Mariupol Greek|Greek minority]] in the city.

In 2002, ethnic [[Ukrainians]] made up the largest percentage (48.7%) but less than half of the population; the second greatest ethnicity was Russian (44.4%). A June–July 2017 survey indicated that Ukrainians had grown to 59% of Mariupol's population and the Russian share had dropped to 33%.<ref name="IRI2017">{{Cite web |date=August 2017 |title=Public Opinion Survey of Residents of UkraineJune 9 – July 7, 2017 |url=http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2017-8-22_ukraine_poll_presentation.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822212837/http://www.iri.org/sites/default/files/2017-8-22_ukraine_poll_presentation.pdf |archive-date=22 August 2017 |publisher=iri.org |page=86}}</ref>

The city is home to the largest population of [[Pontic Greeks]] in Ukraine ("Greeks of Priazovye") at 21,900, with 31,400 more in the six nearby rural areas, totaling about 70% of the Pontic Greek population of the area and 60% for the country.

{{Original research section|date=August 2009}}
<!-- This section desperately needs sources -- the term "Rumaiic" appears nowhere in Google Web/Books/Scholar -->
The city is predominantly Russian speaking. From 60% to 80% of Ukrainian-language inhabitants communicate in [[Surzhyk]], due to the large influence of Russian culture.

Most Greek-speaking villages in the region speak a dialect called [[Rumeíka]], a branch of [[Pontic Greek]]. About 17 villages speak this language today. Modern scholars distinguish five subdialects of Rumeíka according to their similarity to standard [[Modern Greek]]. This was derived from the dialect of the original Pontic settlers from the [[Crimea]]. Although Rumeíka is often described as a Pontic dialect, the situation is more nuanced. Arguments can be brought both for Rumeíka's similarity to Pontic Greek and to the Northern Greek dialects. In the view of Maxim Kisilier, while the Rumeíka dialect shares some features with both the Pontic Greek and the Northern Greek dialects, it is better considered on its own terms as a separate Greek dialect, or even a group of dialects.<ref name="kis">{{Citation |last=Kisilier |first=Maxim |title=Is Rumeíka a Pontic or a Northern Greek Dialect? |url=https://www.academia.edu/1727534 |access-date=1 November 2017 |archive-date=28 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220328204351/https://www.academia.edu/1727534 |url-status=live }}</ref>
<!--
Many Romaiic features are similar to those found in [[Cretan dialect|Cretan]], [[Cypriot Greek|Cypriot]], and [[Northern Greek dialect]]s along with partial Slavic and possible Tatar influences. As we still do not have a detailed description of Greek dialects, Rumaiica should be regarded as a dialect of Pontic Greek [[dialectology]]. -->

The village of [[Anadol (village)|Anadol]] speaks Pontic proper, being settled from the [[Pontus (region)|Pontos]] in the 19th century. After the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, a Rumaiic revival occurred in the region. The Soviet administration established a Greek-Rumaiic theater, several magazines and a newspaper, and a number of Rumaiic language schools. The best Rumaiic poet [[Georgi Kostoprav]] created a Rumaiic poetic language for his work. This process was reversed in 1937 as Kostoprav and many other Rumaiics and Urums were killed as part of [[Joseph Stalin]]'s national policies.<ref name=":0">{{Citation |title=Language and Ethno-Cultural Situation in Greek Villages of Azov Region |url=http://iling.spb.ru/pdf/kisilier/greki_priazov.pdf |year=2009 |editor-last=Kissilier |editor-first=Maxim |place=St. Petersburg |access-date=28 February 2013 |archive-date=12 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220312235205/https://iling.spb.ru/pdf/kisilier/greki_priazov.pdf |url-status=live }}. The work is based on field research in the Greek villages in the Mariupol region. The expeditions were organised by St. Petersburg State University and carried out from 2001–2004.</ref>

A new attempt to preserve a sense of ethnic Rumaiic identity started in the mid-1980s. The Ukrainian scholar Andriy Biletsky created a new Slavonic alphabet for Greek speakers. Though a number of writers and poets make use of this alphabet, the population of the region rarely uses it. The Rumaiic language is declining rapidly, most endangered by the standard Modern Greek which is taught in schools and the local university. The latest investigations by Alexandra Gromova demonstrate that there is still hope that elements of the Rumaiic population will continue to use the dialect.<ref name=":0" />

Along with those speaking Rumeíka, there were and are a number of [[Tatar]]-speaking Orthodox villages, the so-called [[Urums]], which is the Tatar term for Romaios or Rumei. This subdivision had already occurred in Crimea before the settlement of the Azov Sea [[steppe]] region by [[Pontic Greeks]] which began following the fall of the [[Empire of Trebizond]] in northeastern [[Anatolia]] in 1461. It occurred on a larger scale after the end of the [[Russo-Turkish War]] in 1779, as part of the Russian policy to populate and develop the region while depriving the Crimea of an economically active part of its population. Though Greek- and Tatar-speaking settlers lived separately, the [[Urum language|language of the Urums]] was the [[lingua franca]] of the region for a long time, being called the language of the [[bazaar]].

There are also a number of settlements of other ethnic communities, including [[Germans]], [[Bulgarians]], and [[Albanians]] (though the meanings of all such terms in this context is open to dispute).

The largest enterprises were [[Illich Steel and Iron Works|Ilyich Iron and Steel Works]], Azovstal, Azovmash Holding, and the Mariupol Sea Trading Port. There were also shipyards, fish canneries, and various educational institutions with studies in [[metallurgy]] and science.

The total industrial production of the city for eight months in 2005 (January – August) was 21378.2 million hryvnas (US$4.233 billion), compared to 1999 – 6169.806 million hryvnas (US$1.222 billion). This was 37.5% of the total production for [[Donetsk Oblast]]. The leading business of the city was [[ferrous metallurgy]], which made up 93.5% of the city's income from industrial production. The annual output estimates are in millions of tonnes of iron, steel, rolled iron, and agglomerate.

* [[Illich Steel and Iron Works]] (Mariupol Metallurgical Combine named Ilyich) was an [[Steel mill#Integrated mill|integrated mill]], with all the facilities for a full metallurgical cycle.

The enterprise had multiple structural divisions: Management of Public Catering and Trade ("УОПТ", a network of 52 enterprises), a [[Chain store|chemist's network]] Ilyich-Pharm, more than 50 [[agriculture|agro shops]] (former [[collective farms]] of the south of Donetsk and [[Zaporizhzhia Oblast]]s), the office of the Komsomol Mines, various machine-building enterprises in the [[Cherkasy Oblast]], [[Mariupol International Airport]], and the Mariupol Television Network (locally known as MTV).

Its production varied in millions of tonnes of [[pig-iron]], steel, and rolled iron annually. The company's general director was Oleksiy Bilyi. Azovstal was closely connected with the Mariupol [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] works, "Markokhim", which served as its supplier of coke.
