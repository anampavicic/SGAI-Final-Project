==Etymology and names==
Until the fifth century AD, the city was known as ''Argantorati'' (in the [[Nominative case|nominative]], ''Argantorate'' in the [[Locative case|locative]]), a Celtic [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] name [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] first as ''Argentorate'' (with Gaulish locative ending, as appearing on the first [[Milestone|Roman milestones]] in the first century) and then as ''[[Argentoratum]]'' (with regular Latin nominative ending, in later Latin texts). That Gaulish name is a compound of ''-rati'', the Gaulish word for fortified enclosures, cognate to the [[Old Irish]] ''ráth'' (see [[ringfort]]) and ''arganto(n)-'' (cognate to Latin ''argentum'', which gave modern French ''argent''), the Gaulish word for silver, but also any precious metal, particularly gold, suggesting either a fortified enclosure located by a river gold mining site, or hoarding gold mined in the nearby rivers.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Quand l'argent était d'or. Paroles de Gaulois. |journal=Gallia |volume=63 |pages=211–241 |author=Jean-Marie Pailler |publisher=[[CNRS]]|language=fr|year=2006 |doi=10.3406/galia.2006.3296|s2cid=194088001 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01908254/file/Gallia_2006_211-241_PAILLER.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01908254/file/Gallia_2006_211-241_PAILLER.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the fifth century the city became known by a completely different name, later [[Francization|Gallicized]] as Strasbourg ([[Alsatian language|Lower Alsatian]]: ''Strossburi''; {{Langx|de|Straßburg}}). That name is of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] origin and means 'town (at the crossing) of roads'. The modern ''Stras-'' is [[cognate (etymology)|cognate]] with the German ''[[wikt:Straße|Straße]]'' and English ''street'', both derived from [[Latin]] ''[[wikt:strata#Latin|strata]]'' ("paved road"), while ''-bourg'' is cognate with the German ''[[wikt:Burg|Burg]]'' and English ''[[borough]]'', both derived from [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] ''[[wikt:Appendix:Proto-Germanic/burgz|*burgz]]'' ("hill fort, fortress").

[[Gregory of Tours]] was the first to mention the name change: in the tenth book of his ''[[Gregory of Tours#History of the Franks|History of the Franks]]'' written shortly after 590 he said that [[Egidius (bishop of Reims)|Egidius]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Reims|Bishop of Reims]], accused of plotting against King [[Childebert II]] of [[Austrasia]] in favor of his uncle King [[Chilperic I]] of [[Neustria]], was tried by a [[synod]] of Austrasian bishops in [[Metz]] in November 590, found guilty and removed from the priesthood, then taken "''ad Argentoratensem urbem, quam nunc Strateburgum vocant''" ("to the city of Argentoratum, which they now call ''Strateburgus''"), where he was exiled.<ref>{{cite book |title=Historia Francorum|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OWL-l5ssoYC&q=historia%20francorum%20argentoratensem&pg=RA2-PT187 |author=Gregory of Tours |volume=10th book, chapter XIX |page=553 |access-date=7 March 2017 |year=1849 |author-link=Gregory of Tours}}</ref>

The [[Castra|Roman camp]] of [[Argentoratum]] was first mentioned in 12 BCE; the city of Strasbourg which grew from it celebrated its 2,000th anniversary in 1988. The fertile area in the [[Upper Rhine Plain]] between the rivers [[Ill (France)|Ill]] and [[Rhine]] had already been populated since the [[Middle Paleolithic]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Musée Archéologique - Strasbourg De la Préhistoire au Moyen-Âge en Alsace |url=http://www.hominides.com/html/lieux/musee-archeologie-strasbourg.php |website=Hominidés.com |access-date=17 July 2017 |archive-date=5 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170705055718/http://www.hominides.com/html/lieux/musee-archeologie-strasbourg.php |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Du Paléolithique au Néolithique |url=https://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/du-paleolithique-au-neolithique |publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg |access-date=29 January 2019 |archive-date=3 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180903215155/https://www.musees.strasbourg.eu/du-paleolithique-au-neolithique |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Between 362 and 1262, Strasbourg was governed by the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Strasbourg|bishops of Strasbourg]]; their rule was reinforced in 873 and then more in 982.<ref>{{cite web |title=Les temps de l'histoire de Strasbourg |url=https://archives.strasbourg.eu/n/les-temps-de-l-histoire-de-strasbourg/n:106 |publisher=Archives de la ville et de l'Eurométropole de Strasbourg |access-date=17 July 2017 |archive-date=12 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170612000548/https://archives.strasbourg.eu/n/les-temps-de-l-histoire-de-strasbourg/n:106 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1262, the citizens violently rebelled against the bishop's rule ([[Battle of Hausbergen]]) and Strasbourg became a [[free imperial city]]. It became a French city in 1681, after the conquest of Alsace by the armies of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]. In 1871, after the [[Franco-Prussian War]], the city, as part of the [[Imperial Territory of Alsace–Lorraine]], became German again, until 1918 (end of [[World War I]]), when it reverted to France. Strasbourg was captured by the [[Wehrmacht|German army]] in June 1940 at the end of the [[Battle of France]] ([[World War II]]), and subsequently came under German control again through formal annexation into the [[Gau Baden]]-Elsaß under the Nazi Gauleiter [[Robert Heinrich Wagner|Robert Wagner]]; since the liberation of the city by the [[2nd Armored Division (France)|2nd French Armoured Division]] under [[General officer|General]] [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Leclerc]] in November 1944, it has again been a French city. In 2016, Strasbourg was promoted from capital of [[Alsace]] to capital of [[Grand Est]].

Strasbourg played an important part in the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]], with personalities such as [[John Calvin]], [[Martin Bucer]], [[Wolfgang Capito]], [[Matthew Zell|Matthew]] and [[Katharina Zell]], but also in other aspects of Christianity such as [[German mysticism]], with [[Johannes Tauler]], [[Pietism]], with [[Philipp Spener]], and [[Reverence for Life]], with [[Albert Schweitzer]]. Delegates from the city took part in the [[Protestation at Speyer]]. It was also one of the first centres of the printing industry with pioneers such as [[Johannes Gutenberg]], [[Johannes Mentelin]], and [[Heinrich Eggestein]]. Among the darkest periods in the city's long history were the years 1349 ([[Strasbourg massacre]]), 1518 ([[Dancing plague of 1518|Dancing plague]]), 1793 ([[Reign of Terror]]), 1870 ([[Siege of Strasbourg]]) and the years 1940–1944 with the Nazi occupation (atrocities such as the [[Jewish skull collection]]) and the British and American [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing raids]]. Some other notable dates were the years 357 ([[Battle of Strasbourg|Battle of Argentoratum]]), 842 ([[Oaths of Strasbourg]]), 1538 (establishment of [[University of Strasbourg|the university]]), 1605 (world's first newspaper printed by [[Johann Carolus]]), 1792 ({{Lang|fr|[[La Marseillaise]]|italic=no}}), and 1889 (pancreatic origin of [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] discovered by [[Oskar Minkowski|Minkowski]] and [[Joseph von Mering|Von Mering]]).

Strasbourg has been the seat of [[European institutions in Strasbourg|European institutions]] since 1949: first of the [[International Commission on Civil Status]] and of the [[Council of Europe]], later of the [[European Parliament]], of the [[European Science Foundation]], of [[Eurocorps]], and others as well.

==Geography==

===Location===
[[File:Strasbourg SPOT 1163.jpg|thumb|right|Strasbourg seen from Spot Satellite]]
Strasbourg is situated at the eastern border of France with Germany. This border is formed by the [[Rhine]], which also forms the eastern border of the modern city, facing across the river to the German town [[Kehl]]. The historic core of Strasbourg, however, lies on the [[Grande Île (Strasbourg)|Grande Île]] in the river [[Ill (France)|Ill]], which here flows parallel to, and roughly {{convert|4|km|mi}} from, the Rhine. The natural courses of the two rivers eventually join some distance downstream of Strasbourg, although several artificial waterways now connect them within the city.

The city lies in the [[Upper Rhine Plain]], at between {{convert|132|and|151|m|ft}} above sea level, with the upland areas of the [[Vosges Mountains]] some {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west and the [[Black Forest]] {{convert|25|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the east. This section of the Rhine valley is a major axis of north–south travel, with river traffic on the Rhine itself, and major roads and railways paralleling it on both banks.

The city is some {{convert|397|km|}} east of [[Paris]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://frdistance.com/route/paris/strasbourg|title=Distance entre Paris et Strasbourg en voiture|website=frdistance.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-12-18|archive-date=18 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218193503/https://frdistance.com/route/paris/strasbourg|url-status=live}}</ref> The mouth of the Rhine lies approximately {{convert|450|km}} to the north, or {{convert|650|km}} as the river flows, whilst the head of navigation in [[Basel]] is some {{convert|100|km}} to the south, or {{convert|150|km}} by river.

===Climate===
In spite of its position far inland, Strasbourg has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''),<ref>{{cite web|title=Strasbourg Climate Strasbourg Temperatures Strasbourg Weather Averages|url=http://www.strasbourg.climatemps.com/|access-date=29 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170624202042/http://www.strasbourg.climatemps.com/|archive-date=24 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Temperature, Climate graph, Climate table for Strasbourg |url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/350/ |website=Climate-Data |access-date=29 September 2017}}</ref> though with less maritime influence than the milder climates of Western and [[Southern France]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.assistancescolaire.com/enseignant/elementaire/ressources/base-documentaire-en-geographie/les-climats-en-france-france_climates |title=Les climats en France - Ressources pour les enseignants - Ressources élémentaire |website=www.assistancescolaire.com |language=fr |access-date=2019-03-30}}</ref> The city has warm, relatively sunny summers and cool, [[overcast]] winters.

The third highest temperature ever recorded was {{convert|38.5|°C|1|abbr=on}} in August 2003, during the [[2003 European heat wave]].

===Architecture===
[[File:Strasbourg Cathedral Exterior - Diliff.jpg|thumb|[[Strasbourg Cathedral|Strasbourg, Cathedral of Our Lady]]]]

The city is chiefly known for its [[sandstone]] [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[Strasbourg Cathedral|Cathedral]] with its famous [[Strasbourg astronomical clock|astronomical clock]], and for its medieval cityscape of [[Rhineland]] black and white [[timber framing|timber-framed]] buildings, particularly in the ''[[Petite France, Strasbourg|Petite France]]'' district or ''Gerberviertel'' ("tanners' district") alongside the Ill and in the streets and squares surrounding the cathedral, where the renowned ''[[Kammerzell House|Maison Kammerzell]]'' stands out.

Notable medieval streets include ''[[Rue Mercière, Strasbourg|Rue Mercière]]'', ''Rue des Dentelles'', ''Rue du Bain aux Plantes'', ''Rue des Juifs'', ''Rue des Frères'', ''Rue des Tonneliers'', ''Rue du Maroquin'', ''Rue des Charpentiers'', ''Rue des Serruriers'', ''Grand' Rue'', ''Quai des Bateliers'', ''Quai Saint-Nicolas'' and ''Quai Saint-Thomas''. Notable medieval squares include ''Place de la Cathédrale'', ''Place du Marché Gayot'', ''Place Saint-Étienne'', ''Place du Marché aux Cochons de Lait'' and ''Place Benjamin Zix''.

[[File:Strasbourgriver.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Ill with [[St. Thomas, Strasbourg|Église Saint-Thomas]]]]

In addition to the cathedral, Strasbourg houses several other medieval churches that have survived the many wars and destructions that have plagued the city: the [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] ''Église Saint-Étienne'', partly destroyed in 1944 by Allied [[Strategic bombing|bombing raids]]; the part-Romanesque, part-Gothic, very large ''[[St. Thomas, Strasbourg|Église Saint-Thomas]]'' with its [[Gottfried Silbermann|Silbermann]] organ on which [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]] and [[Albert Schweitzer]] played;<ref>{{Base Mérimée|PA00085032|Eglise Saint-Thomas}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.itineraires-silbermann.org/strasbourg-saint-thomas/ |title=Strasbourg - Eglise protestante Saint-Thomas |publisher=itineraires-silbermann.org |access-date=13 July 2022 }}</ref> the Gothic ''[[Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune Protestant Church|Église protestante Saint-Pierre-le-Jeune]]'' with its crypt dating back to the seventh century and its [[cloister]] partly from the eleventh century; the Gothic ''[[Saint William's Church, Strasbourg|Église Saint-Guillaume]]'' with its fine early-Renaissance [[stained glass]] and furniture; the Gothic ''Église Saint-Jean''; the part-Gothic, part-[[Art Nouveau]] ''[[Sainte-Madeleine Church; Strasbourg|Église Sainte-Madeleine]]'' etc. The [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] church ''[[Old Saint Peter's Church, Strasbourg|Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Catholique]]'' (there is also an adjacent church ''Saint-Pierre-le-Vieux Protestant'') serves as a shrine for several 15th-century wood-worked and painted [[Altar#In Western Christian churches|altars]] coming from other, now destroyed churches and installed there for public display; especially the [[The Passion of Christ (Strasbourg)|Passion of Christ]]. Among the numerous secular medieval buildings, the monumental ''[[Ancienne Douane (Strasbourg)|Ancienne Douane]]'' (old [[custom-house]]) stands out.

The [[German Renaissance]] has bequeathed the city some noteworthy buildings (especially [[Neubau (Strasbourg)|the current ''Chambre de commerce et d'industrie'']], former [[City and town halls|town hall]], on ''Place Gutenberg''), as did the [[French Baroque and Classicism]] with several ''hôtels particuliers'' (i.e. [[palace]]s), among which the ''[[Palais Rohan, Strasbourg|Palais Rohan]]'' (completed 1742, used for university purposes from 1872 to 1895,<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Strassburg |volume=25 |page=984}}</ref> now housing three museums) is the most spectacular. Other buildings of its kind are the "[[Hôtel de Hanau]]" (1736, now the city hall); the ''[[Hôtel de Klinglin]]'' (1736, now residence of the {{lang|fr|[[préfet]]}}); the ''[[Hôtel des Deux-Ponts]]'' (1755, now residence of the [[Military Governor|military governor]]); the ''Hôtel d'Andlau-Klinglin'' (1725, now seat of the administration of the [[Port autonome de Strasbourg]]) etc. The largest baroque building of Strasbourg though is the {{convert|150|m|ft|adj=mid|-long}} 1720s main building of the ''[[Hôpital civil, Strasbourg|Hôpital civil]]''. As for French [[Neoclassicism|Neo-classicism]], it is the [[Strasbourg Opera House|Opera House]] on [[Place Broglie]] that most prestigiously represents this style.

Strasbourg also offers high-class [[eclecticism in art|eclecticist]] buildings in its very extended German district, the ''[[Neustadt, Strasbourg|Neustadt]]'', being the main memory of [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelmian architecture]] since most of the major cities in Germany proper suffered intensive damage during World War II. Streets, boulevards and avenues are homogeneous, surprisingly high (up to seven stories) and broad examples of German urban lay-out and of this [[architectural style]] that summons and mixes up five centuries of European architecture as well as Neo-Egyptian, [[Neo-Grec|Neo-Greek]] and Neo-Babylonian styles. The former imperial palace ''[[Palais du Rhin]]'', the most political and thus heavily criticized of all German Strasbourg buildings epitomizes the grand scale and stylistic sturdiness of this period. But the two most handsome and ornate buildings of these times are the [[Pontonniers International High School|École internationale des Pontonniers]] (the former ''[[Höhere Mädchenschule]]'', with its towers, turrets and multiple round and square angles<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archi-strasbourg.org/adresse-3_rue_des_Pontonniers_Centre_ville_Strasbourg-702.html?check=1&archiIdAdresse=702&archiAffichage=adresseDetail&debut= |title=Pictures |publisher=Archi-strasbourg.org |access-date=15 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105134906/http://www.archi-strasbourg.org/adresse-3_rue_des_Pontonniers_Centre_ville_Strasbourg-702.html?check=1&archiIdAdresse=702&archiAffichage=adresseDetail&debut= |archive-date=5 January 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the ''[[Haute école des arts du Rhin]]'' with its lavishly ornate façade of painted bricks, woodwork and [[Maiolica|majolica]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.archi-strasbourg.org/adresse-1_rue_de_Acad%C3%A9mie_Krutenau_Strasbourg-508.html?check=1&archiIdAdresse=508&archiAffichage=adresseDetail&debut= |title=Views |access-date=20 August 2021 |archive-date=10 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510234327/http://www.archi-strasbourg.org/adresse-1_rue_de_Acad%C3%A9mie_Krutenau_Strasbourg-508.html?check=1&archiIdAdresse=508&archiAffichage=adresseDetail&debut= |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:OrgueSaintThomasStrasbourg.jpg|thumb|left|The baroque organ of the [[St. Thomas, Strasbourg|Église Saint-Thomas]]]]

Notable streets of the German district include: ''Avenue de la Forêt Noire'', ''Avenue des Vosges'', ''Avenue d'Alsace'', ''Avenue de la Marseillaise'', ''Avenue de la Liberté'', ''Boulevard de la Victoire'', ''Rue Sellénick'', ''Rue du Général de Castelnau'', ''Rue du Maréchal Foch'', and ''Rue du Maréchal Joffre''. Notable squares of the German district include ''[[Place de la République (Strasbourg)|Place de la République]]'', ''Place de l'Université'', ''Place Brant'', and ''Place Arnold''.

Impressive examples of [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] military architecture of the 1880s can be found along the newly reopened ''Rue du Rempart'', displaying large-scale fortifications among which the aptly named ''Kriegstor'' (war gate).

As for modern and [[contemporary architecture]], Strasbourg possesses some fine [[Art Nouveau]] buildings (such as the huge ''[[Palais des Fêtes]]'' and houses and villas like ''[[Villa Schutzenberger]]'' and ''[[Hôtel Brion]]''), good examples of post-World War II functional architecture (the ''Cité Rotterdam'', for which [[Le Corbusier]] did not succeed in the architectural contest) and, in the very extended ''Quartier Européen'', some spectacular administrative buildings of sometimes utterly large size, among which the [[European Court of Human Rights building]] by [[Richard Rogers]] is arguably the finest. Other noticeable contemporary buildings are the new [[College or university school of music|Music school]] ''Cité de la Musique et de la Danse'', the ''[[Strasbourg Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art|Musée d'Art moderne et contemporain]]'' and the ''Hôtel du Département'' facing it, as well as, in the outskirts, the tramway-station [[Hoenheim]]-Nord designed by [[Zaha Hadid]].

[[File:Absolute place Kleber 02.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Place Kléber]]'']]

The city has many bridges, including the medieval and four-towered ''[[Ponts Couverts (Strasbourg)|Ponts Couverts]]'' that, despite their name, are no longer covered. Next to the ''Ponts Couverts'' is the ''[[Barrage Vauban]]'', a part of [[Vauban]]'s 17th-century fortifications, that does include a covered bridge. Other bridges are the ornate 19th-century ''Pont de la Fonderie'' (1893, stone) and ''Pont d'Auvergne'' (1892, iron), as well as architect [[:fr:Marc Mimram|Marc Mimram]]'s futuristic ''Passerelle'' over the Rhine, opened in 2004.

The largest square at the centre of the city of Strasbourg is the [[Place Kléber]]. Located in the heart of the city's commercial area, it was named after general [[Jean Baptiste Kléber|Jean-Baptiste Kléber]], born in Strasbourg in 1753 and assassinated in 1800 in [[Cairo]]. In the square is a statue of Kléber, under which is a vault containing his remains. On the north side of the square is the [[Aubette (building)|Aubette]] (Orderly Room), built by [[Jacques-François Blondel|Jacques François Blondel]], architect of the king, in 1765–1772.

Strasbourg features a number of prominent parks, of which several are of cultural and historical interest: the ''Parc de l'Orangerie'', laid out as a French garden by [[André Le Nôtre|André le Nôtre]] and remodeled as an [[Landscape garden|English garden]] on behalf of [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], now displaying noteworthy French gardens, a neo-classical castle and a small [[zoo]]; the ''Parc de la Citadelle'', built around impressive remains of the 17th-century [[Fortification|fortress]] erected close to the [[Rhine]] by [[Vauban]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.archi-strasbourg.org/adresse-1_3e_Regiment_Tir_Algeriens_Place_Esplanade_Strasbourg-904.html?check=1&archiIdAdresse=904&archiAffichage=adresseDetail&debut= |title=Parc de la Citadelle with remains of the Vauban fortress |publisher=Archi-strasbourg.org |date=26 August 2007 |access-date=15 April 2010 |archive-date=5 January 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105145149/http://www.archi-strasbourg.org/adresse-1_3e_Regiment_Tir_Algeriens_Place_Esplanade_Strasbourg-904.html?check=1&archiIdAdresse=904&archiAffichage=adresseDetail&debut= |url-status=dead }}</ref> the ''Parc de Pourtalès'', laid out in English style around a [[baroque]] castle (heavily restored in the 19th century) that now houses a small three-star hotel,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chateau-pourtales.eu/cms/front_content.php?idcat=1&changelang=3 |title=Overview |publisher=chateau-pourtales.eu |access-date=12 December 2010 |archive-date=28 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100728101001/http://www.chateau-pourtales.eu/cms/front_content.php?idcat=1&changelang=3 |url-status=live }}</ref> and featuring an [[open-air museum]] of international contemporary sculpture.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ceaac.org/html/espace_public/pourtales/frame.htm |title=Overview |publisher=Ceaac.org |access-date=15 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204060533/http://www.ceaac.org/html/espace_public/pourtales/frame.htm |archive-date=4 December 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Jardin botanique de l'Université de Strasbourg]] (botanical garden) was created under the German administration next to the [[Observatory of Strasbourg]], built in 1881, and still owns some [[greenhouse]]s of those times. The ''Parc des Contades'', although the oldest park of the city, was completely remodeled after World War II. The futuristic ''Parc des Poteries'' is an example of European park-conception in the late 1990s. The ''Jardin des deux Rives'', spread over Strasbourg and [[Kehl]] on both sides of the Rhine opened in 2004 and is the most extended (60-hectare) park of the agglomeration. The most recent park is ''Parc du Heyritz'' (8,7 ha), opened in 2014 along a canal facing the ''[[Hôpital civil, Strasbourg|hôpital civil]]''.

===Museums===
As of 2020, the city of Strasbourg has eleven municipal museums (including ''Aubette 1928''),<ref>{{cite web |title=Museums |url=https://en.musees.strasbourg.eu/ |publisher=Musées de la ville de Strasbourg |access-date=3 January 2020 |archive-date=26 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191226012927/https://en.musees.strasbourg.eu/ |url-status=live }}</ref> eleven university museums,<ref>{{cite web |title=Jardin des Sciences - Et aussi |url=https://jardin-sciences.unistra.fr/patrimoine-universitaire/decouvrir/et-aussi/ |publisher=University of Strasbourg |access-date=3 January 2020 |archive-date=1 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200401050023/http://jardin-sciences.unistra.fr/patrimoine-universitaire/decouvrir/et-aussi/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> and at least two privately owned museums (''Musée vodou'' and ''Musée du barreau de Strasbourg''). Five communes in the metropolitan area also have museums (see below), three of them dedicated to military history.

====Overview====
The collections in Strasbourg are distributed over a wide range of museums, according to a system that takes into account not only the types and geographical provenances of the items, but also the epochs. This concerns in particular the following domains:
*[[Old Master]] paintings from the Germanic [[Rhine|Rhenish]] territories and until 1681 are displayed in the ''Musée de l'Œuvre Notre-Dame'' (MOND); old master paintings from all the rest of Europe (including the Dutch Rhenish territories) and until 1871, as well as old master paintings from the Germanic Rhenish territories between 1681 and 1871, are displayed in the ''Musée des Beaux-Arts''; paintings since 1871 are displayed in the ''Musée d'art moderne et contemporain'' (MAMCS).
*[[Decorative arts]] until 1681 are on display in the MOND, decorative arts from the years 1681 until 1871 are on display in the ''Musée des arts décoratifs'', decorative arts after 1871 are on display at the MAMCS, with items from each epoch also shown in the ''Musée historique''.
*Prints and drawings until 1871 are displayed in the ''Cabinet des estampes et dessins'', save for the original plans of Strasbourg Cathedral, displayed in the MOND. Prints and drawings after 1871 are displayed in the MAMCS, and in the ''Musée Tomi Ungerer/Centre international de l'illustration'' (the combined number of prints and drawings amounts to well over 200,000).
*Artefacts from Ancient Egypt are on display in two entirely different collections, one in the ''Musée archéologique'' and the other belonging to the ''Instituts d'Égyptologie et de Papyrologie'' of the University of Strasbourg.

==Education==

===Universities and tertiary education===
Strasbourg, well known as a centre of [[humanism]], has a long history of excellence in higher education, at the crossroads of French and German intellectual traditions. Although Strasbourg had been annexed by the Kingdom of France in 1683, it still remained connected to the German-speaking intellectual world throughout the 18th century, and the university attracted numerous students from the [[Holy Roman Empire]], with [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]], [[Klemens Wenzel, Prince von Metternich|Metternich]] and [[Maximilian von Montgelas|Montgelas]], who studied law in Strasbourg, among the most prominent. With 19 Nobel prizes in total, Strasbourg is the most eminent French university outside of Paris.

Until 2009, there were three [[University of Strasbourg|universities in Strasbourg]], with an approximate total of 48,500 students in 2007, and another 4,500 students attended one of the diverse [[Postgraduate education|post-graduate]] schools:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universites-formations-alsace.fr/index.php?langue=1 |title=L'enseignement universitaire en Alsace|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012164855/http://www.universites-formations-alsace.fr/index.php?langue=1 |archive-date=12 October 2007 |date=12 October 2007 |access-date=3 June 2011}}</ref>

==Libraries==
[[File:Absolute Bibliotheque nationale 01.jpg|thumb|right|Lateral view of the [[Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire|National Library]]]]
The [[Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire]] (BNU) is, with its collection of more than 3,000,000 titles,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bnu.fr/BNU/FR/A+propos/ |title=Figures |publisher=Bnu.fr |access-date=15 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204042757/http://www.bnu.fr/BNU/FR/A%20propos/ |archive-date=4 December 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> the second-largest library in France after the {{lang|fr|[[Bibliothèque nationale de France]]|italic=no}}. It was founded by the German administration after the complete destruction of the previous municipal library in 1871 and holds the unique status of being simultaneously a students' and a national library. The Strasbourg municipal library had been marked erroneously as "City Hall" in a French commercial map, which had been captured and used by the German artillery to lay their guns. A librarian from Munich later pointed out "...that the destruction of the precious collection was not the fault of a German artillery officer, who used the French map, but of the slovenly and inaccurate scholarship of a Frenchman."<ref name="Butler, Pierce 1945. Page 15">Butler, Pierce. 1945. ''Books and libraries in wartime''. Chicago, IL: [[University of Chicago Press]]. p. 15</ref>

The municipal library Bibliothèque municipale de Strasbourg (BMS) administers a network of ten medium-sized libraries in different areas of the town. A six stories high "Grande bibliothèque", the ''Médiathèque [[André Malraux]]'', was inaugurated on 19 September 2008 and is considered the largest in Eastern France.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160313063450/http://www.lexpress.mu/display_article.php?news_id=114962 Strasbourg ouvre une grande médiathèque sur le port] in [[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] {{in lang|fr}}</ref>

===Incunabula===
As one of the earliest centres of book-printing in Europe (see above: History), Strasbourg for a long time held a large number of [[Incunable|incunabula]] — books printed before 1500 — in its library as one of its most precious heritages: no less than 7,000.<ref name="BNU">{{cite web |url=https://www.bnu.fr/fr/services/nos-collections/les-incunables |title=Les incunables |date=10 December 2019 |publisher=Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire de Strasbourg |language=fr |access-date=9 January 2020 |archive-date=28 May 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200528073044/https://www.bnu.fr/fr/services/nos-collections/les-incunables |url-status=live }}</ref> After the total destruction of this institution in 1870, however, a new collection had to be reassembled from scratch.

[[File:Strasbourg PontThéâtre 02.JPG|thumb|One of Strasbourg's trams passes over one of its canals, whilst a tourist trip boat passes underneath.]]
Train services operate from the ''[[Gare de Strasbourg]]'', the city's main station in the city centre, eastward to [[Offenburg]] and [[Karlsruhe]] in Germany, westward to [[Metz]] and Paris, and southward to [[Basel]]. Strasbourg's links with the rest of France have improved due to its recent connection to the [[TGV]] network, with the first phase of the [[LGV Est|TGV ''Est'']] (Paris–Strasbourg) in 2007, the [[LGV Rhin-Rhône|TGV ''Rhin-Rhône'']] (Strasbourg-[[Lyon]]) in 2012, and the second phase of the TGV Est in July 2016.

Strasbourg also has its [[Strasbourg Airport|own airport]], serving major domestic destinations as well as international destinations in Europe and [[North Africa|northern Africa]]. The airport is linked to the ''Gare de Strasbourg'' by a frequent train service.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://strasbourg.aeroport.fr/EN/Passengers/Flights/Destination-map.html | title = Destination map | publisher = Aéroport Strasbourg | access-date = 18 September 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150918101006/http://strasbourg.aeroport.fr/EN/Passengers/Flights/Destination-map.html | archive-date = 18 September 2015 | url-status = live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://strasbourg.aeroport.fr/EN/Passengers/Access/Shuttle-train.html | title = Shuttle train | publisher = Aéroport Strasbourg | access-date = 18 September 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150918100759/http://strasbourg.aeroport.fr/EN/Passengers/Access/Shuttle-train.html | archive-date = 18 September 2015 | url-status = live}}</ref>

City transport in Strasbourg includes the [[Strasbourg tramway]], which opened in 1994 and is operated by the regional transit company [[Compagnie des Transports Strasbourgeois]] (CTS), consisting of 6 lines with a total length of {{convert|55.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The CTS also operates a comprehensive bus network throughout the city that is integrated with the trams. With more than {{convert|500|km|0|abbr=on}} of bicycle paths, biking in the city is convenient and the CTS operates a cheap [[bike-sharing]] scheme named ''Vélhop''. The CTS, and its predecessors, also operated a previous generation of [[tram]] system between 1878 and 1960, complemented by [[trolleybus]] routes between 1939 and 1962.<ref name="krebs">{{cite news |last1=Krebs |first1=Eric |title=Europe's New Trams Are Reviving a Golden Age of Transit |url=https://reasonstobecheerful.world/europe-tram-systems-revival/ |work=Reasons to be Cheerful |date=4 August 2022}}</ref>

Being on the [[Ill (France)|Ill]] and close to the [[Rhine]], Strasbourg has always been an important centre of [[fluvial navigation]], as is attested by archeological findings. In 1682 the ''[[Canal de la Bruche]]'' was added to the river navigations, initially to provide transport for [[sandstone]] from quarries in the [[Vosges]] for use in the fortification of the city. That canal has since closed, but the subsequent ''[[Canal du Rhône au Rhin]]'', ''[[Canal de la Marne au Rhin]]'' and ''[[Grand Canal d'Alsace]]'' are still in use, as is the important activity of the ''[[Port autonome de Strasbourg]]''. Water tourism inside the city proper attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists yearly.

The tram system that now criss-crosses the historic city centre complements walking and biking in it. The centre has been transformed into a [[pedestrian zone|pedestrian priority zone]] that enables and invites walking and biking by making these active modes of transport comfortable, safe and enjoyable. These attributes are accomplished by applying the principle of [[Permeability (spatial and transport planning)|"filtered permeability"]] to the existing irregular network of streets. It means that the network adaptations favour [[active transport]] and, selectively, "filter out" the car by reducing the number of streets that run through the centre. While certain streets are discontinuous for cars, they connect to a network of pedestrian and bike paths which permeate the entire centre. In addition, these paths go through public squares and open spaces increasing the enjoyment of the trip. This logic of filtering a mode of transport is fully expressed in a comprehensive model for laying out neighbourhoods and districts – the [[fused grid]].

At present the [[A35 autoroute]], which parallels the Rhine between [[Karlsruhe]] and [[Basel]], and the [[A4 autoroute]], which links [[Paris]] with Strasbourg, penetrate close to the centre of the city. The ''Grand contournement ouest'' (GCO) project, programmed since 1999, planned to construct a {{convert|24|km|mi|adj=mid|-long}} highway connection between the junctions of the A4 and the A35 autoroutes in the north and of the A35 and [[A352 autoroute|A352]] autoroutes in the south. This routes well to the west of the city in order to divest a significant portion of motorized traffic from the [[unité urbaine]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.grand-est.developpement-durable.gouv.fr/|title=DREAL Grand Est|first=DREAL Grand|last=Est|date=22 March 2023|website=DREAL Grand Est}}</ref> The GCO project was opposed by environmentalists, who created a [[Zone to Defend|ZAD]] (or [[Zone to Defend]]).<ref name="GCOFigaro">{{cite news |last1=Caravagna |first1=Léo |title=Strasbourg : une ébauche de ZAD contre le projet de grand contournement ouest |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2017/02/16/01016-20170216ARTFIG00205-strasbourg-une-ebauche-de-zad-contre-le-projet-de-grand-contournement-ouest.php |access-date=5 May 2019 |work=Le Figaro |date=7 February 2017 |archive-date=5 May 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505112702/http://www.lefigaro.fr/actualite-france/2017/02/16/01016-20170216ARTFIG00205-strasbourg-une-ebauche-de-zad-contre-le-projet-de-grand-contournement-ouest.php |url-status=live }}</ref> After much delay, the GCO was finally inaugurated on 11 December 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=Suivez en direct l'inauguration du GCO |url=https://www.dna.fr/faits-divers-justice/2021/12/11/suivez-en-direct-l-inauguration-du-gco-en-presence-de-jean-castex |publisher=[[Les Dernières Nouvelles d'Alsace]] |access-date=11 December 2021 |archive-date=11 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211211100132/https://www.dna.fr/faits-divers-justice/2021/12/11/suivez-en-direct-l-inauguration-du-gco-en-presence-de-jean-castex |url-status=live }}</ref>
