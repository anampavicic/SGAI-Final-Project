It is located {{cvt|200|km|mi|abbr=off}} northwest of Paris, connected to the South of England by the Caen ([[Ouistreham]]) to [[Portsmouth]] ferry route through the [[English Channel]]. Situated a few miles from the coast, the landing beaches, the bustling resorts of [[Deauville]] and [[Cabourg]], as well as [[Norman Switzerland]] and the [[Pays d'Auge]], Caen is often considered the archetype of Normandy.

Caen is known for its historical buildings built during the reign of [[William I of England|William the Conqueror]], who was buried there, and for the [[Battle for Caen]], heavy fighting that took place in and around Caen during the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] in 1944, destroying much of the city. The city has now preserved the memory by erecting a memorial and a museum dedicated to peace, the [[Mémorial de Caen]].

==Etymology==
The first references to the name of Caen are found in different acts of the dukes of [[Duchy of Normandy|Normandy]]: ''Cadon'' 1021/1025,<ref>Marie Fauroux, ''Recueil des actes des ducs de Normandie (911–1066)'', Mémoires de la Société des antiquaires de Normandie XXXVI, Caen, 1961, p. 122, n° 32.</ref> ''Cadumus'' 1025,<ref>''Ibid.'', p. 130, n° 34.</ref> ''Cathim'' 1026/1027.<ref>''Villam que dicitur Cathim super fluvium Olne'': the town called Cathim on the Orne river, ''ibid''., p. 182, n° 58.</ref> Year 1070 of the Parker manuscript<ref>{{Cite web |date=15 August 2007 |title=Manuscript A: The Parker Chronicle |url=http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/a/a-L.html |access-date=7 July 2009 |publisher=Asc.jebbo.co.uk |archive-date=26 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726221228/http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/a/a-L.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> of the ''[[Anglo-Saxon Chronicle]]'' refers to Caen as ''Kadum'',<ref>''Her Landfranc se þe wæs abbod an Kadum com to Ængla lande'': Here [[Lanfranc]] who was [[abbot]] at Caen came to England.</ref> and year 1086 of the Laud manuscript<ref>[http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/e/e-L.html Manuscript E: The Laud Chronicle] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212153114/http://asc.jebbo.co.uk/e/e-L.html |date=12 February 2009}} – Asc.jebbo.co.uk</ref> gives the name as ''Caþum''.<ref>''He swealt on Normandige on þone nextan dæg æfter natiuitas sancte Marie. 7-man bebyrgede hine on Caþum æt sancte Stephanes mynstre'': He [King William] died in Normandy on the day after the Nativity of St Mary and was buried in Caen, in St Stephen's Abbey</ref> Despite a lack of sources as to the origin of the settlements, the name Caen would seem to be of [[Gaulish]] origin, from the words ''catu-'', referring to military activities and ''magos'', field, hence meaning "manoeuvre field" or "battlefield".<ref>René Lepelley, ''Dictionnaire étymologique des noms de communes de Normandie'', P.U.C., Corlet, Caen, [[Condé-sur-Noireau]], 1996</ref> In [[Layamon]]'s [[Layamon's Brut|''Brut'']], the poet asserts that [[King Arthur]] named the city in memory of [[Sir Kay]],<ref>Brut, l. 13,936</ref> although the [[historicity of King Arthur]] is widely doubted.

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Caen}}

===Early history===
{{See also|History of Normandy}}
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2022}}
Caen was known in Roman times as 'Catumagos', from the Gaulish roots ''magos'' meaning 'field' and ''catu'' meaning 'combat'. It remained a minor settlement throughout the Roman period and began to see major development commence in the 10th century, under the patronage of the Dukes of Normandy. Around 1060, [[William the Conqueror]] began construction of the [[Château de Caen]], which became the centre of the ducal court. Duchess [[Matilda of Flanders]] also founded the [[Benedictine]] [[Abbey of Sainte-Trinité, Caen]] around the same time, eventually being buried in the abbey. Caen succeeded [[Bayeux]] as the capital of [[Lower Normandy]], complementing the second ducal capital of [[Rouen]].

Caen fell to [[Philip II of France]] on 21 May 1204, and was incorporated along with the remainder of Normandy into the Kingdom of France.

===Hundred Years' War===
{{Main|Battle of Caen (1346)}}
In 1346, King [[Edward III of England]] led his army against the city, hoping to loot it. It was expected that a siege of perhaps several weeks would be required, but the army took the city in less than a day, on 26 July 1346, [[Battle of Caen (1346)|storming and sacking it]], killing 3,000 of its citizens, and burning much of the merchants' quarter on the Île St-Jean. Only the castle of Caen held out, despite attempts to besiege it. A few days later, the English left, marching to the east and on to their victory at the [[Battle of Crécy]]. It was later [[Siege of Caen (1417)|captured following a siege]] by [[Henry V of England|Henry V]] in 1417 and treated harshly for being the first town to put up any resistance to his invasion. In 1450 towards the end of the war, French forces [[Siege of Caen (1450)|recaptured Caen]].

===World War II===
{{Main|Battle for Caen}}
[[File:Canadian bulldozer in Caen.jpg|thumb|A [[Canadian Army]] bulldozer in Caen, 1944. The towers of the [[Abbey of Saint-Étienne, Caen|Abbaye aux Hommes]] are behind.]]

During [[World War II]], Caen was captured by [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces during the [[Battle of France]] in 1940 and placed under [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|military occupation]]. In 1944, [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces launched [[Operation Overlord]], invading German-occupied France and rapidly advancing through [[Normandy]]. From 6 June to 6 August 1944, the British [[Second Army (United Kingdom)|Second Army]] fought the [[battle of Caen]] to dislodge German forces from the city. During the battle, Allied bombing raids heavily damaged the city and caused numerous French civilian casualties. After the battle, little of prewar Caen remained, and reconstruction efforts in the city continued until 1962.<ref>{{cite book |last=Badsey |first=Stephen |title=Normandy 1944 Allied Landings and Breakout |publisher=Osprey |location=London |year=1990 |isbn=978-0-85045-921-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Badsey |first=S. |chapter=Chapter 4: Culture, Controversy, Caen and Cherbourg: The First Week of the Battle |pages=[https://archive.org/details/normandycampaign00buck_143/page/n60 48]–63 |editor-last=Buckley |editor-first=John |editor-link=John Buckley (historian) |title=The Normandy Campaign 1944: Sixty Years On |url=https://archive.org/details/normandycampaign00buck_143 |url-access=limited |year=2006 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=978-1-134-20304-8 }}</ref>

===Postwar===
Postwar work included the reconstruction of complete districts of the city and the university campus. It took 14 years (1948–1962) and led to the current urbanization of Caen. Having lost many of its historic quarters and its university campus in the war, Caen does not have the atmosphere of a traditional Norman town such as [[Honfleur]], [[Rouen]], [[Cabourg]], [[Deauville]] or [[Bayeux]].

The Canadian Army Film and Photo Unit filmed the D-Day offensive and Orne breakout several weeks later. It returned several months later to document the city's recovery efforts. The resulting film, ''You Can't Kill a City'', is preserved in the [[National Archives of Canada]].

==Geography==
Caen is in an area of high humidity. The river [[Orne (river)|Orne]] flows through the city, as well as small rivers known as ''les Odons'', most of which have been buried under the city to improve urban hygiene. Caen has a large flood zone, named "La prairie", located around the hippodrome, not far from the river Orne, which is regularly submerged.<ref>{{Cite web |title=La Prairie de Caen |url=http://caen.fr/publications/prairie-caen |access-date=23 March 2018 |website=CAEN |language=fr}}{{Dead link|date=October 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=EN IMAGES.

Caen is {{cvt|10|km|mi|abbr=off}} from the [[English Channel|Channel]]. A canal ([[Canal de Caen à la Mer]]) parallel to the Orne was built during the reign of [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to link the city to the sea at all times. The canal reaches the [[English Channel]] at [[Ouistreham]]. A lock keeps the tide out of the canal and lets large ships navigate up the canal to Caen's freshwater harbours.

===Climate===
Caen has an [[oceanic climate]] that is somewhat ameliorated due to its slightly inland position. In spite of this, summers are still cool by French standards and the climate is typically maritime in terms of high precipitation, relatively modest sunshine hours and mild winters.

==Main sights==
===Castle===
The castle, ''[[Château de Caen]]'', built {{Circa|1060}} by William the Conqueror, who successfully [[Norman Conquest of England|conquered England]] in 1066, is one of the largest medieval fortresses of Western Europe. It remained an essential feature of [[Norman dynasty|Norman]] strategy and policy. At Christmas 1182, a [[royal court]] celebration for Christmas in the [[wikt:Special:Search/aula|aula]] of Caen Castle brought together [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] and his sons, [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] and [[John of England|John Lackland]], receiving more than a thousand knights. Caen Castle, along with all of Normandy, was handed over to the French Crown in 1204. The castle saw several engagements during the [[Hundred Years' War]] (1346, 1417, 1450) and was in use as a barracks as late as the Second World War. Bullet holes are visible on the walls of the castle where members of the [[French Resistance]] were shot during the Second World War. Today, the castle serves as a museum that houses the ''Musée des Beaux-Arts de Caen'' (Museum of [[Fine art|Fine Arts]] of Caen) and ''Musée de Normandie'' (Museum of Normandy) along with many periodical exhibitions about arts and history.

===Motto===
Today, Caen has no motto, but it used to have one, which did not survive the [[French Revolution]]. As a result, its spelling is archaic and has not been updated:<ref>{{Cite web |title=French motto and heraldry site |url=http://www.notrefamille.com/v2/services-devises-armoiries/services-devises-armoiries-detail.asp?id=59512811 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090102060704/http://www.notrefamille.com/v2/services-devises-armoiries/services-devises-armoiries-detail.asp?id=59512811 |archive-date=2 January 2009 |access-date=23 November 2009}}</ref>

 <blockquote>''Un Dieu, un Roy, une Foy, une Loy.''</blockquote>
(One God, one King, one Faith, one Law.)

This motto is reflected in a notable old [[Chant royal]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bonjourpoesie.fr/lesgrandsclassiques/poemes/pierre_gringoire/chant_royal |title=Chant royal - Pierre GRINGOIRE - Vos poèmes - Poésie française - Tous les poèmes - Tous les poètes |website=www.bonjourpoesie.fr |access-date=14 June 2022 |archive-date=30 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220930003527/https://www.bonjourpoesie.fr/lesgrandsclassiques/Poemes/pierre_gringoire/chant_royal |url-status=live }}</ref>
