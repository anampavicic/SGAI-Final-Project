'''Alwar''' ([[Rajasthani languages|Rajasthani]] Pronunciation: [[Help:IPA/Hindi and Urdu|[əlʋəɾ]]]) is a city located in India's [[National Capital Region (India)|National Capital Region]] (NCR) and the administrative headquarters of [[Alwar district|Alwar District]] in the state of [[Rajasthan]]. It is located 150&nbsp;km south of [[Delhi]] and 150&nbsp;km north of [[Jaipur]].

== Etymology ==
There are several theories about the derivation of the name Alwar. [[Alexander Cunningham]], the British Indian archeologist, believed that the city derived its name from the Salva tribe and was originally Salwapur, then Salwar, Halawar and eventually Alwar, According to another school it was known as Aravalpur or the city of [[Aravalli Range|Aravali]].

Some others hold that city is named after [[Khanzada Alawal Khan|Khanzada Alawal Khan Mewati]] (the [[Khanzadas of Mewat|Muslim Khanzada]] prince who wrested Alwar from Nikumbh Rajputs){{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}. A research conducted during the reign of Maharaja Jai Singh of Alwar revealed that Maharaja Alaghraj, second son of Maharaja Kakil of [[Jaipur State|Amber]]. ruled the area in the eleventh century and his territory extended up to the present city of Alwar. He founded the city of Alpur in 1106 Vikrami Samvat (1049 A.D.) after his own name which eventually became Alwar{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}. It was formerly spelt as Ulwar but in the reign of Jai Singh the spelling was changed to Alwar{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}. Some sources say that the name Alwar comes from the Persian word timber.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ram|first=Maya|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.146820/page/n17/mode/2up|title=Rajasthan District Gazetteer Alwar|year=1964|location=Jaipur|pages=1}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=August 2021}}

=== Medieval history ===
[[File:2 The Darbar of Raja Bakhtawar Singh of Alwar. alwar, 1810, San Diego.jpg|thumb|left|The Darbar of Raja Bakhtawar Singh of Alwar in 1810]]
Alwar was ruled by multiple dynasties. Notable dynasties included the [[Jadaun Rajputs|Jadauns of Braj]], [[Nikumbha|Nikumbh Rajputs]], the [[Khanzadas of Mewat|Khanzada Rajputs]], the [[Bargujar|Badgujar Rajputs]], and  the [[Rai Sahib|Rai Sahab]] of Rewari who took the control over this area. The [[Maratha Empire]] also ruled this region for a short period. Rao Raja of Rewari, captured the Alwar Fort from the Rajput Naruka  and laid down the foundation for modern day Alwar.

[[Hemu|Hemchandra Vikramaditya]] (Hemu), born in Machari, Rajgarh, a village in Alwar, was a Hindu emperor of North India during the 16th century. This was a period when the Mughals and Afghans were vying for power in the region. Hemu captured Delhi on 7 October 1556 after defeating the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] forces in the Battle of Delhi in the Tughlaqabad area in Delhi, and became the ''de facto'' emperor. He won twenty-two battles in succession and became the last Hindu emperor of Delhi. In 1556, after his defeat in the [[Second Battle of Panipat]], he was executed and Mughal regime was restored in North India. In 1781, the Battle of Mandan fought between Raos of Rewari under leadership of Mitrasen and Rajput Sardar Shardul helped by Mughals. Both side seen heavy casualties with only 6000 Ahirs defeated 25000 rajput forces. The whole area annexed by Raos of Rewari.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ltd |first=Nasadiya Tech Pvt |title=Read Hindi article {{!}} राव मित्रसेन अहीर « Sachin Yadav "A_J" {{!}} प्रतिलिपि |url=https://hindi.pratilipi.com/read/%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B5-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B0-%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B5-%E0%A4%AE%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%A8-%E0%A4%85%E0%A4%B9%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%B0-zfqbrefio01k-217k532569u1mh1 |access-date=2024-09-03 |website=hindi.pratilipi.com |language=hi}}</ref>
