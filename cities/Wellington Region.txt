'''Greater Wellington''', also known as the '''Wellington Region''' ([[Māori language|Māori]]: ''Te Upoko o te Ika''),<ref name=ReorgOrder1989>{{Cite journal |title= The Local Government (Wellington Region) Reorganisation Order 1989 |journal= [[New Zealand Gazette]] |date= 9 June 1989 |pages= 2491 ff }}</ref> is a non-[[Unitary authority#New_Zealand|unitary]] [[regions of New Zealand|region]] of [[New Zealand]] that occupies the southernmost part of the [[North Island]]. The region covers an area of {{convert|8,049|km2}}, and has a population of {{NZ population data 2018|Wellington region|y|y|y|(|).}}

The region takes its name from [[Wellington]], New Zealand's [[capital city]] and the region's seat. The Wellington urban area, including the cities of [[Wellington]], [[Porirua]], [[Lower Hutt]], and [[Upper Hutt]], accounts for {{Rnd|({{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Wellington|y}}|R}}+{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Porirua|y}}|R}}+{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Lower Hutt|y}}|R}}+{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Upper Hutt|y}}|R}})/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Wellington region|y}}|R}}*100|0}} percent of the region's population; other major urban areas include the [[Kapiti Urban Area| Kapiti conurbation]] ([[Waikanae]], [[Paraparaumu]], [[Raumati Beach]], [[Raumati South]], and [[Paekākāriki]]) and the town of [[Masterton]].

==Local government==

The region is administered by the [[Wellington Regional Council]], which uses the promotional name Greater Wellington Regional Council.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/Legal-notices/ |title=Legal notices |publisher=Greater Wellington Regional Council |access-date=3 May 2014}}</ref>

The council region covers the [[conurbation]] around the [[capital city]], [[Wellington City|Wellington]], and the cities of [[Lower Hutt]], [[Porirua]], and [[Upper Hutt]], each of which has a rural hinterland; it extends up the west coast of the North Island, taking in the coastal settlements of the [[Kāpiti Coast District]]; east of the [[Remutaka Range]] it includes three largely rural districts containing most of [[Wairarapa]], covering the towns of [[Masterton]], [[Carterton, New Zealand|Carterton]], [[Greytown, New Zealand|Greytown]], [[Featherston, New Zealand|Featherston]] and [[Martinborough]].<ref name="Constituencies">{{cite web|title=Greater Wellington Regional Council's constituencies |url=http://www.gw.govt.nz/section115.cfm |access-date=2008-05-08 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609200822/http://www.gw.govt.nz/section115.cfm |archive-date=June 9, 2007 }}</ref> The Wellington Regional Council was first formed in 1980 from a merger of the Wellington Regional Planning Authority and the Wellington Regional Water Board.<ref>{{cite book |title=Parks Network Plan |url= http://www.gw.govt.nz/assets/Parks-and-Recreation/Parks-Network-Strategy/Whole-Document.pdf |date=2011 |publisher=Greater Wellington Regional Council |page=10 |access-date=3 May 2014}}</ref>

Following the creation of the Auckland Council 'super-city' in 2009, a similar merger for councils within the Wellington Region was investigated by the [[Local Government Commission (New Zealand)|Local Government Commission]] in 2013. The proposal was scrapped in 2015 following negative public feedback.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/national/69213231/wellington-super-city-scrapped-due-to-lack-of-public-support|title=Wellington super-city scrapped due to lack of public support|date=9 June 2015}}</ref>

== Term ''Wellington region'' ==
{{unreferencedsection|date=September 2021}}
In common usage the terms ''Wellington region'' and ''Greater Wellington'' are not clearly defined, and areas on the periphery of the region are often excluded. In its more restrictive sense the region refers to the cluster of built-up areas west of the Tararua ranges. The much more sparsely populated area to the east has its own name, [[Wairarapa]], and a centre in Masterton. To a lesser extent, the [[Kāpiti Coast]] is sometimes excluded from the region. Otaki in particular has strong connections to the [[Horowhenua]] district to the north. This includes having been part of the [[MidCentral District Health Board]] (DHB) area, instead of the [[Capital and Coast District Health Board|Capital and Coast DHB]] area like the rest of the Kāpiti Coast.

== History ==
The [[Māori people|Māori]] who originally settled the region knew it as ''Te Upoko o te Ika a Māui'', meaning "the head of [[Māui (Māori mythology)|Māui]]'s fish". Legend recounts that [[Kupe]] discovered and explored the region in about the tenth century.

The region was settled by Europeans in 1839 by the [[New Zealand Company]]. Wellington became the capital of [[Wellington Province]] upon the creation of the province in 1853, until the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 Nov 1876.<ref>[http://rulers.org/newzprov.html New Zealand Provinces 1848–77]</ref> Wellington became capital of New Zealand in 1865, the third capital after Russell and Auckland.

== Geography ==
{{See also|Geology of the Wellington Region}}
[[Image:Wellington landsat labelled.jpg|thumb|left|280px| A composite landsat-7 image of the southwestern part of the region]]
[[File:On the Quartz Hill track, Wellington, New Zealand, 7 September 2006 - Flickr - PhillipC.jpg|thumb|On the Quartz Hill track]]

[[File:Plimmerton and Pauatahanui, New Zealand, 3rd. Dec. 2010 - Flickr - PhillipC.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Plimmerton, Paremata and [[Porirua Harbour|Pauatahanui Inlet]]]]

The region occupies the southern tip of the North Island, bounded to the west, south and east by the sea. To the west lies the [[Tasman Sea]] and to the east the [[Pacific Ocean]], the two seas joined by the narrow and turbulent [[Cook Strait]], which is {{convert|28|km|mi}} wide at its narrowest point, between [[Cape Terawhiti]] and Perano Head in the [[Marlborough Sounds]].

The region covers {{convert|7860|km2|sqmi}}, and extends north to [[Ōtaki, New Zealand|Ōtaki]] and almost to [[Eketāhuna]] in the east.

Physically and topologically the region has four areas running roughly parallel along a northeast–southwest axis:
*The [[Kāpiti Coast]], a narrow strip of coastal plain running north from [[Paekākāriki]] towards [[Foxton, New Zealand|Foxton]]. It contains numerous small towns, many of which gain at least a proportion of their wealth from tourism, largely due to their fine beaches. 
*Rough hill country inland from the Kāpiti Coast, formed along the same major [[geologic fault]] responsible for the [[Southern Alps]] in the [[South Island]]. Though nowhere near as mountainous as the alps, the [[Remutaka Range|Remutaka]] and [[Tararua Range|Tararua]] ranges are still hard country and support only small populations, although it is in small coastal valleys and plains at the southern end of these ranges that the cities of Wellington and the [[Hutt Valley]] are located.
*The undulating hill country of the Wairarapa around the [[Ruamahanga River]], which becomes lower and flatter in the south and terminates in the wetlands around [[Lake Wairarapa]] and contains much rich farmland. 
*Rough hill country, lower than the Tararua Range but far less economic than the land around the Ruamahanga River. This and the other hilly striation are still largely forested.

=== Urban areas ===
Over three-quarters of the {{NZ population data 2018|Wellington region|y|y|y|people (|)}} reside in the four cities at the southwestern corner. Other main centres of population are on the Kāpiti Coast and in the fertile farming areas close to the upper Ruamahanga River in the Wairarapa.

Along the Kāpiti Coast, numerous small towns sit close together, many of them occupying spaces close to popular beaches. From the north, these include [[Ōtaki, New Zealand|Ōtaki]], [[Waikanae]], [[Paraparaumu]], the twin settlements of [[Raumati Beach]] and [[Raumati South]], [[Paekākāriki]] and [[Pukerua Bay]], the latter being a northern suburb of [[Porirua]]. Each of these settlements has a population of between 2,000 and 10,000, making this moderately heavily populated.

In the Wairarapa the largest community by a considerable margin is [[Masterton]], with a population of over 20,000. Other towns include [[Featherston, New Zealand|Featherston]], [[Martinborough]], [[Carterton, New Zealand|Carterton]] and [[Greytown (New Zealand)|Greytown]].

==Transport==
{{Main|Public transport in the Wellington Region}}

Public transport in the region is well developed compared to other parts of New Zealand. It consists of [[bus]]es, [[train]]s, [[car]]s, [[ferry|ferries]] and a [[funicular]] (the [[Wellington Cable Car]]). It also included [[tram]]s until 1964 and [[trolleybus]]es until 2018. Buses and ferries are privately owned, with the infrastructure owned by public bodies, and public transport is often [[subsidy|subsidised]]. The Regional Council is responsible for planning and subsidising public transport. The services are marketed under the name ''Metlink''. [[Transdev Wellington]] operates the metropolitan train network, running from the Wellington CBD as far as [[Waikanae]] in the north and [[Masterton]] in the east.

The internationally recognised [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] estuarine wetlands site at [[Foxton Beach]] is of note as having one of the most diverse ranges of wetlands birds to be seen at any one place in New Zealand. A total of 95 species have been identified at the estuary. It is a significant area of salt marsh and mudflat and a valuable feeding ground for many birds including the migratory Eastern bar-tailed Godwit, which flies all the way from Siberia to New Zealand to escape the harsh northern winter. The estuary is also a permanent home to 13 species of birds, six species of fish and four plants species, all of which are threatened. It regularly supports about one percent of the world population of wrybills.<ref name="doc.govt.nz">{{cite web |title=Manawatu Estuary |url=https://www.doc.govt.nz/parks-and-recreation/places-to-go/manawatu-whanganui/places/manawatu-estuary |website=doc.govt.nz |publisher=New Zealand Department of Conservation |language=en-nz}} [[File:CC-BY icon.svg|50px]]  Text was copied from this source, which is available under a [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/  Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License].</ref>
