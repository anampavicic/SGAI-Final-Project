Kumasi is a commercial, economic, and trading hub in Ghana, home to the biggest market in [[West Africa]]: the [[Kejetia Market]]. The city is the centre of Asante culture, hence also being nicknamed "Osei-Krom" or simply "Oseikrom", along with attracting many visitors.<ref name="kumasi summary3"/>{{rp|9}} The city is also home to numerous trade associations, such as the Aboabo Talia Producers’
Association. Half of the country's [[Wood processing|timber processing]] takes place in the city. The Centre for National Culture, [[Wesley College of Education, Kumasi|Wesley College of Education]], and [[Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital]] are all located in the city.<ref name="kumasi summary2"/>{{rp|10}}<ref name="Kuamsi summary3"/>

== History ==
{{Main|History of Kumasi}}

=== Etymology ===
Kumasi derived from the [[Twi]] word ''Kumase'', meaning 'under the kum tree' in which ''kum'' meant 'the tree' and ''ase'' means 'under'. The word was the name of a [[Plum|''Okum'' tree]] in Kwaman, planted by [[Okomfo Anokye]].<ref name="etymology"/>

In 1888, [[R. Austin Freeman]] was disappointed with the ruins of Kumasi following the British destruction in 1874 and the Ashanti civil war before 1888.
{{Blockquote|Kumasi was a great disappointment to me, and my disappointment increased as I
walked round and examined the town. It was not merely that so little existed, but that so much had been destroyed. As it stands, or then stood, the town was nothing more than a large clearing in the forest, over which were scattered, somewhat irregularly, groups of houses. The paths were dirty and ill kept, and between the groups of houses large patches of waste ground intervened, and on these, amidst the tall, coarse grass that covered them, were to be seen the remains of houses that had once occupied them. These houses once stood in wide and regular streets, but since the destruction of the city in 1874 the natives do not seem to have had heart to rebuild them. Yet there remained some few vestiges to show what Kumasi had been in its palmy days... A few broad, well-kept streets still existed, lined by houses, [of] ... admirable construction, careful and artistic finish and excellent repair...|R.

In 1926, following the return of the Ashanti King [[Prempeh I]] after 30-year in exile in Seychelles Island, Kumasi was vested with ceremonial control over the Ashanti sub-states. The full role of king was restored by the colonial administration in 1935. The city holds an important place in the history of the Ashanti people, as legend claims that it was here Okomfo Anokye received the [[Asante royal thrones|golden stool]], an embodiment of the soul of Ashanti nation.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-05-05 |title=Kumasi |website=Ashantibiz |url=https://www.ashantibiz.com/kumasi/ |access-date=2023-08-29 |language=en-US}}</ref>

Kumasi is located in the [[Kumasi Metropolitan Assembly|Kumasi Metropolitan]], one of more than thirty districts in the Ashanti Region. It covered a land area of {{convert|214.3|sqkm|sqft|abbr=on}} and is elevated {{convert|250|to|300|mm|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The metropolitan bordered the [[Kwabre East Municipal District]] and [[Afigya Kwabre North District]] to the north, the [[Atwima Kwanwoma District]] and [[Atwima Nwabiagya Municipal District]] to the west, the [[Ejisu Municipal Assembly|Ejisu Municipal District]] and [[Asokore Mampong (municipal district)|Asokore Mampong Municipal District]] towards the east and the [[Bosomtwe District]] to the south.<ref name="2010 census"/>{{rp|1}}

=== Environmental issues ===
Due to large amounts of [[Structural encroachment|encroachment]], water pollution in the city is increasing, threatening rivers such as the Wiwi and the Subin. A 2024 report said that in the Kumasi Metropolitan, "more land alongside the rivers was being used for industrial, residential and commercial purposes than for green spaces." The researchers criticized that "city authorities were ineffective in controlling development in these areas" and recommended that "there should be a buffer of 100 feet (30 metres) along water bodies."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Takyi|first1=S.|last2=Amponsah|first2=O.|url=https://theconversation.com/ghana-kumasi-citys-unplanned-boom-is-destroying-two-rivers-sewage-heavy-metals-and-chemical-pollution-detected-220740|title=Ghana: Kumasi city's unplanned boom is destroying two rivers – sewage, heavy metals and chemical pollution detected|date=7 February 2024|publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]]|access-date=18 September 2024}}</ref>

== Cityscape ==
=== Urban planning ===
Historically, the city was planned based on traditional land settlement patterns and land use systems of the [[Asante Empire]]. Although this doesn't count as the city being 'formally' planned, it was considered to be well-organized with physical structures complying to the local culture and architecture. Some areas of Kumasi were declared as sacred. As well as being planned using traditional land settlement patterns, pre-colonial houses either did have streets or did not, and the ones that did had one were often narrow and were only used to get access neighbours houses.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Fosu|first=A.|url=https://revues.imist.ma/index.php/AJLP-GS/article/view/31547|title=Urban Planning, Institutional Pluralism, and Indigenous Belief Systems in Peri-Urban Ghana in the Era of Land Commoditisation|journal=African Journal on Land Policy and Geospatial Sciences|date=2022|volume=5|issue=2|doi=10.48346/IMIST.PRSM/ajlp-gs.v5i2.31547|doi-access=free|page=273|accessdate=30 October 2024}}</ref> In the present time, Kumasi is described as having unregulated informal activities, overdevelopment of slums, rapid urban growth, and poor services.<ref name="kumasi overview2">{{cite journal|last1=Cobbinah|first1=P.|last2=Gaisie|first2=E.|display-authors=1|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0264275119317731|title=Kumasi: Towards a sustainable and resilient cityscape|journal=[[Cities (journal)|Cities]]|volume=97|date=2020|doi=10.1016/j.cities.2019.102567|access-date=22 September 2024}}</ref>{{rp|5}}
