It is located in the far north-east corner of [[Syria]] and distinguished by its fertile lands, plentiful water, natural environment, and more than one hundred archaeological sites. It was formerly known as [[Al-Jazira Province]].

== Geography ==
[[File:Al-Jazira.svg|thumb|right|300px|Map of the [[al-Jazira, Mesopotamia|Jazira]] (Upper [[Mesopotamia]]), with its provinces, in medieval times]]

During the Abbasid era, the area that makes this province used to be part of the [[Diyar Rabi'a]] administrative unit, corresponding to the southern part of [[Upper Mesopotamia]]. Kurdistan did not include the lands of Syrian Jazira.{{#tag:ref|Modern Curdistan is of much greater extent than the ancient Assyria, and is composed of two parts, the Upper and Lower. In the former is the province of Ardelaw, the ancient Arropachatis, now nominally a part of Irak Ajami, and belonging to the north-west division called Al Jobal. It contains five others, namely, Betlis, the ancient Carduchia, lying to the south and south-west of the lake Van. East and south-east of Betlis is the principality of Julamerick—south-west of it, is the principality of Amadia—the fourth is Jeezera ul Omar, a city on an island in the Tigris, and corresponding to the ancient city of Bezabde—the fifth and largest is Kara Djiolan, with a capital of the same name. The pashalics of Kirkook and Solimania also comprise part of Upper Curdistan. Lower Curdistan comprises all the level tract to the east of the Tigris, and the minor ranges immediately bounding the plains, and reaching thence to the foot of the great range, which may justly be denominated the Alps of western Asia.<br />''A Dictionary of Scripture Geography'' (1846), John Miles.<ref name="John Miles">John R.

== Political history ==
{{See also|Rojava conflict}}

The French, following the Ottoman policies which encouraged the nomadic tribes to become sedentary, established several villages and towns since the beginning of their rule.<ref>{{cite book|last=Tejel|first=Jordi|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4f54qsU618C&pg=PA147|title=Syria's Kurds: History, Politics and Society|year=2008|isbn=9781134096435|pages=146–147|publisher=Routledge }}</ref> [[Al-Hasakah|Hasakah]] was founded in 1922, [[Qamishli]] in 1926.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Schmidinger|first=Thomas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=omsMMQAACAAJ|title=Krieg und Revolution in Syrisch-Kurdistan: Analysen und Stimmen aus Rojava|date=2017-03-22|publisher=Mandelbaum Verlag|isbn=978-3-85476-665-0|pages=63|language=de}}</ref> In the late 1930s a small but vigorous separatist movement emerged in Qamishli. With some support from [[Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French Mandate]] authorities, the movement actively lobbied for autonomy directly under French rule and its separation from Syria on the ground that the majority of the inhabitants were not Arabs. Syrian nationalists saw the movement as a profound threat to their eventual rule. The Syrian nationalists allied with local [[Arabs|Arab]] Shammar tribal leader and Kurdish tribes. They together attacked the Christian movement in many towns and villages. Local Kurdish tribes who were allies of [[Shammar]] tribe sacked and burned the Assyrian (Syriac) town of Amuda.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-Zw8BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA270|title= Being Modern in the Middle East: Revolution, Nationalism, Colonialism, and the Arab Middle Class|author= Keith David Watenpaugh|page= 270|year= 2014|publisher= Princeton University Press|isbn= 9781400866663}}</ref> In 1941, the Assyrian (Syriac) community of [[al-Malikiyah]] was subjected to a vicious assault. Even though the assault failed, Assyrians (Syriacs) felt threatened and left in large numbers, and the immigration of Kurds from Turkey to the area converted al-Malikiya, [[al-Darbasiyah]] and [[Amuda]] to Kurdish-majority cities.

Between 1932 and 1939, a Kurdish-Assyrian autonomy movement emerged in Jazira. The demands of the movement were autonomous status similar to the [[Sanjak of Alexandretta]], the protection of French troops, promotion of Kurdish language in schools and hiring of Kurdish officials. The movement was led by Michel Dome, mayor of Qamishli, Hanna Hebe, general vicar for the Syriac-Catholic Patriarch of Jazira, and the Kurdish notable Hajo Agha. Some Arab tribes supported the autonomists while others sided with the central government. In the legislative elections of 1936, autonomist candidates won all the parliamentary seats in Jazira and Jarabulus, while the nationalist Arab movement known as the National Bloc won the elections in the rest of Syria. After victory, the National Bloc pursued an aggressive policy toward the autonomists. In July 1937, armed conflict broke out between the Syrian police and the supporters of the movement. As a result, the governor and a significant portion of the police force fled the region and the rebels established local autonomous administration in Jazira.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Romano|first1=David|last2=Gurses|first2=Mehmet|title=Conflict, Democratization, and the Kurds in the Middle East: Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|pages=88–89|year=2014}}</ref> In August 1937 a number of Assyrians in Amuda were killed by a pro-Damascus Kurdish chief.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jwaideh|first=Wadie|title=The Kurdish National Movement: Its Origins and Development|year=2006|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=146}}</ref> In September 1938, Hajo Agha chaired a general conference in Jazira and appealed to France for self-government.<ref>{{cite book|last=McDowell|first=David|title=A modern history of the Kurds|year=2004|publisher=Tauris|page=471}}</ref> The new French High Commissioner, Gabriel Puaux, dissolved parliament and created autonomous administrations for Jabal Druze, Latakia and Jazira on 8 July 1939 which lasted until 1943.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4f54qsU618C|title= Syria's Kurds: History, Politics and Society|first= Jordi |last=Tejel|publisher=Routledge|page=36 |year= 2008|isbn= 9781134096435}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=1939-07-09 |title=FRANCE WILL RULE SYRIA BY COUNCIL; Constitution Is Suspended as the President's Resignation Terminates Local Regime KINGDOM MAY BE SET UP Protest Over Failure to Grant Independence Has Led to Political Impasse (Published 1939) |language=en |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1939/07/09/archives/france-will-rule-syria-by-council-constitution-is-suspended-as-the.html |access-date=2023-07-30}}</ref>

*[[Nagar, Syria|Tell Brak]]: Situated halfway between al-Hasakah city and the frontier town of Qamishli.  Excavations in the tell have revealed the Uyun Temple and King [[Naram-Sin of Akkad|Naram-Sin]]'s palace-stronghold.
*[[Tell Sheikh Hamad]]
*[[Chagar Bazar]]
*[[Tell Arbid]]
*[[Tell Barri]]
*[[Urkesh]]
*[[Tell Beydar]]
*[[Tell el Fakhariya]]
*[[Tell Hittin]]: 15 layers of occupation have been identified.
*[[Tell Leilan]]: Excavations began in 1975 and have revealed many artefacts and buildings dating back to the [[6th millennium BC]] such as a bazaar, temple, palace, etc.
