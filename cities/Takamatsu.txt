== History ==
The area of Takamatsu was part of ancient [[Sanuki Province]]. During the [[Heian period|Heian]] and [[Kamakura period]], as the closest port to [[Honshu]] from Shikoku island, the area was a transportation center and gateway for pilgrims to the [[Kotohira-gū|Kotohira Shrine]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], [[Ikoma Chikamasa]] suit the first [[Takamatsu Castle (Sanuki)|Takamatsu Castle]] in 1588. In 1642, [[Matsudaira Yorishige]], the son of [[Tokugawa Yorifusa]] of [[Mito Domain]] and grandson of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], was awarded the 120,000 ''koku'' [[Takamatsu Domain]], which his descendants would continue to rule until the [[Meiji restoration]].<ref name="Nakayama">{{cite book |last1=Nakayama |first1=Yoshiaki |title=江戸三百藩大全 全藩藩主変遷表付 |date=2015 |publisher=Kosaido Publishing |isbn= 978-4331802946}}{{in lang|ja}}</ref>

Following the Meiji restoration, the city of Takamatsu was created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on February 15, 1890. The [[tenshu|castle tower]] formerly used as the symbol of the city was destroyed during the [[Meiji period]].  The city borders expanded in several iterations by the annexation on neighboring villages and towns. During [[World War II]], Takamatsu was selected as a target by the United States' [[XXI Bomber Command]] because the city was an important focal point of Shikoku's rail and road transit systems, and containing some industry vital to supporting the war effort. On July 3, 1945, at 6:40 PM ([[Japan Standard Time|JST]]) 128 [[B-29 Superfortress]] bombers dropped over 800 tons of incendiary bombs on Takamatsu, destroying 78% of the built-up areas of the city and killing 1359 people.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/61702152/21st-Bomber-Command-Tactical-Mission-Report-247-250-Ocr|title = 21st Bomber Command Tactical Mission Report 247, 250, Ocr &#124; Aviation &#124; Armed Conflict}}</ref>
