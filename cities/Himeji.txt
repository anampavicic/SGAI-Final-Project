== History ==
Himeji has been the center of [[Harima Province]] since the [[Nara period]], and was the location of the [[kokufu|provincial capital]] and [[Harima Kokubun-ji]].  After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]], [[Ikeda Terumasa]] received a [[fief]] at Harima Province and established the [[Himeji Domain]]. He expanded [[Himeji Castle]] and its [[jōkamachi|castle town]].  Due to its  location dominating the [[San'yōdō]] highway connecting the [[Kinai region]] with western Japan, Himeji was a major stronghold of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] through the [[Bakumatsu period]]. Following the [[Meiji restoration]], Himeji was the capital of "Himeji Prefecture" (later Shikama Prefecture) from 1871, which was merged into Hyōgo Prefecture in 1876. The city of Himeji was established on April 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system. After the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], the Japanese government reportedly considered moving the nation's capital from Tokyo to Himeji. On April 1, 1996, Himeji attained [[Core cities of Japan|Core city]] status, with increased local autonomy.

On March 27, 2006, the town of [[Yasutomi, Hyōgo|Yasutomi]] (from [[Shisō District, Hyōgo|Shisō District]]), the town of [[Kōdera, Hyōgo|Kōdera]] (from [[Kanzaki District, Hyōgo|Kanzaki District]]), and the towns of [[Ieshima, Hyōgo|Ieshima]] and [[Yumesaki, Hyōgo|Yumesaki]] (both from [[Shikama District, Hyōgo|Shikama District]]) were merged into Himeji.

===Air raids===
During [[World War II]], Himeji was a target for the United States' [[XXI Bomber Command]] as it was an important rail terminal and contained two large military zones. The first air raid occurred o June 22, 1945 at 0950, in which 60 [[B-29 Superfortress]] bombers centered on Andrea containing a [[Kawanishi Aircraft Company]] factory. The bombing killed 341 people and rendered 10,220 homeless. The second attack occurred on July 3, 1945 at 16:23, 107 aircraft dropped 767 tons of [[incendiary bomb]]s on Himeji, destroying 63.3% of the built up areas of the city.<ref>[https://www.scribd.com/doc/61702152/21st-Bomber-Command-Tactical-Mission-Report-247-250-Ocr 21st Bomber Command Tactical Mission Report 247, 250, Ocr<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, the famous Himeji Castle, although blackened by smoke from the burning city, remained unscathed, even with one firebomb being dropped on it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.davidmillett.net/Articles/38%20Article.aspx|title=David Millet|access-date=2016-04-07|archive-date=2020-11-28|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201128192634/http://davidmillett.net/Articles/38%20Article.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref> This attack killed 173 people, severely wounded 160, and resulted in the destruction of 10,300 buildings, rendering 45,182 people homeless.

==Government==
Himeji has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 46 members. Himeji contributes eight members to the [[Hyogo Prefectural Assembly]]. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the Hyōgo 11th and Hyōgo 12th districts of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].
