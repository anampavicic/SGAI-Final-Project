== Etymology ==
The name ''Chaman'' is thought to be derived from [[garden]] in [[Urdu]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=2001-09-28 |title=Eyewitness: 'Heat, dust and desolation' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/1568438.stm |access-date=2024-08-03 |language=en-GB |quote=The Pakistani border of Chaman lies at the foot of the Khozak pass.
