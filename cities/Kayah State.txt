'''Kayah State''' ({{langx|my|ကယားပြည်နယ်}}, {{IPA-my|kəjá pjìnɛ̀|pron}}), or '''Karenni State''', is a [[administrative divisions of Myanmar|state]] of [[Myanmar]]. Situated in eastern Myanmar, it is bounded on the north by [[Shan State]], on the east by [[Thailand]]'s [[Mae Hong Son Province]], and on the south and west by [[Kayin State]]. It lies approximately between 18° 30′ and 19° 55′ north latitude and between 96° 50′ and 97° 50′ east longitude. The area is {{convert|11,670|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Its capital is [[Loikaw]] (also spelt Loi-kaw). The estimated population in the [[2014 Myanmar Census]] was 286,738, the smallest among Myanmar's seven states. It is inhabited primarily by the [[Karenni people|Karenni]] ethnic group, also known as Red Karen<ref name=EB1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Karen-Ni |volume=15 |page=678}}</ref> or Kayah, a [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan]] people.

==Geography==
Karenni (Kayah) State is located in the eastern part of Myanmar. The relief of Karenni (Kayah) State is mountainous with the [[Dawna Range]] and the [[Karen Hills]] also known as "Karenni-Karen" mountains separated by the [[Salween River]] as it flows through Karenni (Kayah) State.<ref>[http://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/Topic.aspx?id=150 Global 200 ecoregion: Karenni-Karen / Tenasserim Moist Forests]</ref> Balu Chaung flows from [[Inle Lake]] to Than Lwin River and converges with the Salween in southern Karenni (Kayah) State.

[[Dams in Myanmar|Lawpita Dam]], built in 1950 as a bilateral reparation agreement with Japan, is a major hydroelectric production dam that produces a quarter of the total hydroelectric power generation in Myanmar.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.burmariversnetwork.org/dam-projects/lawpita-hydropower.html |title=Lawpita Hydropower Project |access-date=30 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119003720/http://burmariversnetwork.org/dam-projects/lawpita-hydropower.html |archive-date=19 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==History==
===19th century and British rule===
{{main|Karenni States}}
'''Karenni States''' is the name formerly given to a group of states that included '''Kantarawadi''', '''Kyebogyi''' and '''Bawlake'''. These states were located south of the [[Shan State|Federated Shan States]] and east of [[British Burma]]. According to the 1930 census, the states had a total population of 58,761 with Kantarawadi ({{convert|3161|sqmi|disp=or}}), 30,677, Kyebogyi ({{convert|790|sqmi|disp=or}}), 14,282 and Bawlake ({{convert|568|sqmi|disp=or}}), 13,802.

The [[British government]] recognised and guaranteed the independence of the Karenni States in an 1875 treaty June 21st<ref name=EB1911/> with Burmese King [[Mindon Min]], by which both parties recognised the area as belonging neither to [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbaung]] Burma nor to [[Great Britain]]. Consequently, the Karenni States were never fully incorporated into [[British Burma]]. The Karenni States were recognised as tributary to British Burma in 1892,<ref name=EB1911/> when their rulers agreed to accept a stipend from the British government. In the 1930s, the [[Mawchi]] Mine in Bawlake was the most important source of [[tungsten]] in the world.

===Independence to 1988===
[[File:Lawpita Fall.jpeg|300px|thumb|Lawpita Waterfall]]
The Constitution of the [[Union of Burma]] in 1947 proclaimed that the three Karenni States be amalgamated into a single constituent state of the union, called '''Karenni State'''. It also provided for the possibility of secession from the Union after 10 years.

After this the Bamar government invaded Karenni State and in 1948 August 9th, the [[Karenni people|Karenni]] leader U Bee Htu Re started the resistance against the Invading Bamar government and military dictatorship which continues till the present day to regain freedom, self-determination, and to allow Karenni people to live in peaceful harmony with the environment on their own land. Therefore, the 9th August is called "Karenni Resistance Day".

In September 8th 1948, the [[Karenni people|Karenni]] leader U Bee Htu Re was assassinated by central government militia for his opposition to the inclusion of the [[Karenni States]] in the Union of Burma. Therefore, the date of 8th September is called "Karenni Martyr's Day".

In 1952, the former [[Shan people|Shan]] state of [[Mong Pai]] (1901. pop - 19,351) was added to Karenni State, and the whole renamed Kayah State, possibly with the intent of driving a wedge between the [[Karenni people|Karenni]] (in Kayah State) and the rest of the [[Karen people]] (in [[Karen State]]), both fighting for independence.

In 1957, pro-independence groups already active in the area formed the [[Karenni National Progressive Party]] (KNPP), backed by its own army, the [[Karenni Army]] (KA). Apart from a brief ceasefire in 1995, the KA has been fighting ever since. Rivals to the KNPP include the leftist [[Kayan New Land Party]] (KNLP), and the Karenni National People's Liberation Front (KNPLF), both of which are now allied with the Myanmar military.

===1988–2021===
In 1996, Myanmar's [[State Law and Order Restoration Council]] (SLORC) stepped up its campaign to crush Karenni independence with a population transfer program, forcibly moving villagers to designated relocation sites to deprive the pro-independence forces of bases of support.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} The Myanmar government has been accused of massive [[human rights violations]] in the region.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

In June 2019, six young Karenni protesters were arrested after being sued by the Kayah State government for calling Chief Minister [[L Phaung Sho]] a "traitor" to Karennis due to a statue of Gen. [[Aung San]] being erected in [[Loikaw]], the state capital.<ref>{{cite news|last=Htwe|first=Zaw Zaw|title=Karenni Youth Jailed for Calling Govt Officials Criminals, 'Enemies of Ethnic Unity'|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/karenni-youth-jailed-calling-govt-officials-criminals-enemies-ethnic-unity.html|access-date=27 December 2023|work=[[The Irrawaddy]]|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=7 November 2019|location=[[Yangon]]}}</ref>

In September 2020, Sho was impeached by the state's parliament and subsequently removed as chief minister by President [[Win Myint]] due to his misuse of state funds, with [[Boss Ko]] appointed as acting chief minister in his stead.<ref>{{cite news|last=Aung|first=San Yamin|title=Myanmar President Removes Kayah State Chief Minister From Office for Misusing Funds|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/myanmar-president-removes-kayah-state-chief-minister-office-misusing-funds.html|access-date=27 December 2023|work=[[The Irrawaddy]]|publisher=Irrawaddy Publishing Group|date=3 September 2020|location=[[Yangon]]}}</ref>

===Post-2021===
In the context of the ongoing [[2021 Myanmar coup d'état|post-coup]] [[Myanmar civil war (2021–present)|civil war]], on 7 November 2023, the [[Karenni National People's Liberation Front]], [[Karenni Army]], and [[Karenni Nationalities Defence Force]] launched a military offensive known as [[Operation 1107]] against the ruling [[State Administration Council]] junta. An additional offensive, known as [[Operation 1111]], started on 11 November 2023 with the aim of capturing Loikaw.<ref>{{cite news |title=ကရင်နီဒေသ ၁၁၀၇ စစ်ဆင်ရေး တိုက်ပွဲ ဆင်နွှဲ |url=https://www.bbc.com/burmese/articles/cyx2379qdz9o |access-date=10 November 2023 |work=[[BBC News]] မြန်မာ |date=9 November 2023 |language=my |archive-date=10 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231110124854/https://www.bbc.com/burmese/articles/cyx2379qdz9o |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=ကရင်နီဒေသ ၁၁၀၇ စစ်ဆင်ရေး စတင် |url=https://burmese.voanews.com/a/7346374.html |access-date=10 November 2023 |work=ဗွီအိုအေ |date=8 November 2023 |language=my|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20231110130401/https://burmese.voanews.com/a/7346374.html|archive-date=November 10, 2023}}</ref>
In an interview with ''The Irrawaddy'' on 28 November, the KNDF's deputy commander-in-chief Marwi ({{langx|my|မာဝီက}}) claimed that the anti-junta forces controlled 80% of Kayah state and had control over half of Loikaw, where an interim Karenni state government was being established to replace the junta installed state government which had collapsed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kha|first=Kyaw|url=https://www.irrawaddy.com/in-person/interview/operation-1111-close-to-securing-all-of-kayah-state-for-myanmar-resistance.html|title=Operation 1111 'Close to Securing All of Kayah State for Myanmar Resistance'|work=[[The Irrawaddy]]|date=28 November 2023|access-date=28 November 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.bnionline.net/en/news/juntas-administration-ousted-karenni-state-loikaw-still-war-zone | title=Junta's Administration Ousted from Karenni State- Loikaw still a war-zone }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=[[The Irrawaddy]]|title=Christmas mass held for IDPs in Karenni State|url=https://www.facebook.com/theirrawaddy/posts/pfbid0563cJ5n6qRa1jMcjiLXzYuR33CRSfpHqNDiqMrDVkJumWcz76pXJGpekoVzWCqPMl|website=[[Facebook]]|publisher=[[Meta Platforms|Meta Platforms, Inc.]]|access-date=27 December 2023|date=26 December 2023}}</ref>

[[File:Kayah1120.JPG|thumb|Figurines of nine of the subgroups of the Kayah.]]
[[Ethnographers]] classify anywhere from seven to ten [[ethnic groups]] (not including ethnic sub-groups) as native to Kayah State. In addition, [[Shan people|Shan]], [[Intha people|Intha]], and [[Bamar]] live in the north and [[Pa-O]] in surrounding hills. Each group is also known by more than one name. Clearly, ethnicity in Kayah State is a complex issue, made more complex by the current political situation. According to the 1983 census conducted by [[United Nations]] and the Burmese government, the Kayah composed 56.12%, while [[Bamar]] (17.58%), [[Shan people|Shan]] (16.66%), [[Karen people|Karen]] (6.45%), mixed races (2.08%), and other groups formed minorities. Ethnolinguists distinguish the following linguistic groups in Kayah State:
# [[Karenni people|Karenni]] (Red people)
# [[Kayan (Burma)|Padaung]] ([[Kayan (Myanmar)|Kayan]])
# [[Bwe people|Bwe]]
# Geba
# Manumanaw (Kayaw)
# Yantale
# Zayein ([[Lahta language|Kayăn Lahta]])
# Geko (Kayăn Kakhong)
# Yinbaw (Kayăn Kangan)
# Paku ([[Karen people|Karen]])

The major religious [[festival]] is the three-day Kay Htein Bo festival, which commemorates the belief that the creator god gave form to the world by planting a small post in the ground. During this festival, held in late March or early April, a Kay Htoe Boe pole is erected and participants dance around the pole.<ref name="huaypukeng1"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blogg.org/blog-66141.html|title=Les peuples oubliés|publisher=Blogg.org|date=26 August 2007|access-date=4 August 2013}}</ref> This festival is held to venerate the eternal god and creator messengers, to give thanks for blessings during the year, to appeal for forgiveness, and pray for rain. It is also an opportunity for Kayan from different villages to come together to maintain the solidarity of the tribe.

The Kayan have a strong belief in augury and nothing is done without reference to some form of divination, including breaking thatch grass, but most importantly consulting the chicken bones.<ref>{{Citation

Nowadays the annual Kay Htein Bo festival is always accompanied by a reading of the chicken bones to predict the year ahead. Fowl bone prognostication can be witnessed in the Kayan villages in Thailand's Mae Hong Son province during the annual festival and during “Cleansing Ceremonies” which are held when a family has encountered misfortune. Dreams are also used to make predictions.

==Politics==
As with many other states in Myanmar, which have ethnic minority populations, Kayah state has experienced human rights abuses by the Burmese military junta and the Burmese armed forces.

[[File:Kayah State Government Otfice.jpg|300px|thumb|Kayah State Government Otfice]]
Villagers live under the constant threat of rape, beatings, [[arbitrary arrest and detention|arbitrary arrest]] or execution, conscription as [[slave labour]] for the Myanmar army, and having their food and possessions taken without compensation.
<blockquote>
"The [[State Peace and Development Council|SPDC]] also arbitrarily closes roads for non-military travel in Karenni State,
further restricting villagers movements. Landmines are often planted along roads to prohibit the villagers' movements. Villagers, fearful of landmines and potential injuries, further restrict their own movements.

Even with a valid travel pass villagers are still vulnerable to abuses and exploitation. There have been reports of arrests, torture, extrajudicial killings and rapes of villagers who have had permission to travel. Villagers have also been shot at when they have been outside of their communities."<ref name="livingghosts">"Living Ghosts: The spiraling repression of the Karenni population under the Burmese military junta." ''Burma Issues'', March 2008.</ref>{{rp|[27]}}
</blockquote>
It has also been alleged{{by whom?|date=June 2023}} that the relocation centers have inadequate access to water, food, medical services, and educational facilities.{{cn|date=April 2024}} As of April 2024, more than 80% of the state's population is classified as [[internally displaced person|internally displaced]].<ref>{{cite news |title=A Ragtag Resistance Sees the Tide Turning in a Forgotten War |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/20/world/asia/myanmar-war-rebels.html?unlocked_article_code=1.l00.45qw.6zK2wjNfn0XH |work=The New York Times |author=Hannah Beech |date=20 April 2024}}</ref> Thousands of [[Karenni people]] are in [[refugee camps]] in [[Thailand]].{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}
<blockquote>
"Currently there are 4,800 IDPs in eight forced relocation sites throughout Karenni
State. These relocation sites are a result of the Burmese military regimes mass
relocation program in Karenni State in 1996. Following the collapse of the
ceasefire between SLORC and the KNPP, tens of thousands of people were
forcibly evicted from their homes during this program.

"Most relocation sites are located close to military camps, army bases and along
main roads. This increases the vulnerability of exploitation and abuse. IDPs are
subjected to force labour demands from the soldiers and arbitrary taxation
(essentially theft). IDPs are also vulnerable to torture; murder and rape by soldiers
and their movements are heavily restricted.

"The relocation sites are also inadequate to sustain a healthy and economically
viable livelihood. The majority of relocation sites do not have sanitation facilities,
electricity or access to safe drinking water. The land surrounding the sites is
often barren and over populated. As productive land has usually been claimed by
the original inhabitants or confiscated by the soldiers, opportunities to farm are
limited. There are also very few employment opportunities in forced relocation
sites."<ref>"Living Ghosts" 78.</ref>

==Administration==
The state capital is [[Loikaw]]. The state is divided into 4 districts<ref name="kyh">{{cite web|url=https://www.mlis.gov.mm/lsScPop.do?lawordSn=17850|title=ကယားပြည်နယ်အတွင်းရှိ ခရိုင်အမည်များ တိုးချဲ့ပြင်ဆင်ဖွဲ့စည်းခြင်း}}</ref> which are divided into 7 townships with 106 wards and villages.

==Transport==
Kayah State is served by [[Loikaw Airport]] and [[Loikaw Train station]]

==Economy==
[[File:Loikaw market.jpg|300px|thumb|Market near Loikaw, Kayah State]]
Kayah State has a primarily extraction-based economy. The main crop is [[rice]], mostly [[irrigated]], with other important crops including millet, maize, sesame, groundnut, garlic, and vegetables. Mineral products include [[alabaster]], [[tin]], and [[tungsten]]. Valuable woods such as [[teak]] and [[pine]] were once produced, but the forests have largely been stripped bare by [[illegal logging]] authorised by the [[Tatmadaw]] (Burmese military). The [[hydroelectric]] power plant at Lawpita Falls outside of Loikaw is of strategic importance, as it supplies over 20% of Myanmar's total electrical power.

Kayah State has theoretical [[tourist]] potential, if the political situation is resolved. The state has rugged mountains, river streams, lakes and waterfalls; however, transport and communication are difficult. At present, Kayah State is open to outsiders by permit only, which can be difficult to obtain depending on the current military situation. Even with a permit, usually only a {{convert|25|km|0|abbr=on}} radius around Loikaw is allowed. The central government effectively controls only Loikaw and parts of the western half of the state.

==Health care==
Kayah State, most of [[Myanmar]], has poor health care facilities due to the alleged mismanagement by the Burmese military junta and [[Economic sanctions against Burma|economic sanctions]] by the US government. Although health care is nominally free, in reality patients have to pay for medicine and treatment even in public clinics and hospitals. Public hospitals lack many of the basic facilities and equipment. As Kayah State is perhaps the most isolated state in Myanmar, it has great difficulties in addressing health concerns.
In 2016, Loikaw General Hospital was upgraded with the 1.945 billion yen funding from [[Japan International Cooperation Agency|Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA)]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.globalnewlightofmyanmar.com/loikaw-to-get-new-hospital-buildings-funded-by-jica/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150212121915/http://globalnewlightofmyanmar.com/loikaw-to-get-new-hospital-buildings-funded-by-jica/|url-status=usurped|archive-date=12 February 2015|title=Loikaw to get new hospital buildings funded by JICA - Global New Light Of Myanmar|date=11 February 2015|work=Global New Light Of Myanmar|access-date=8 October 2017|language=en-US}}</ref> The following is a summary of the public health care system in the state.<ref name=cso-hosp>{{cite web|url=http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm |title=Hospitals and Dispensaries by State and Division |access-date=19 April 2009 |publisher=Myanmar Central Statistical Organization |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430032618/http://www.etrademyanmar.com/STATS/s0413.htm |archive-date=30 April 2011 }}</ref>
