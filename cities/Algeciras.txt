'''Algeciras''' ({{IPA|es|alxeˈθiɾas|lang|Pronunciation of Algeciras in Spanish.ogg}}) is a city and a [[municipalities in Spain|municipality]] of Spain belonging to the [[province of Cádiz]], [[Andalusia]]. Located in the southern end of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], near the [[Strait of Gibraltar]], it is the largest city on the [[Bay of Gibraltar]] ({{langx|es|Bahía de Algeciras|link=no}}). 

The [[Port of Algeciras]] is [[List of busiest ports in Europe|one of the largest ports in Europe]] and the world in three categories: [[List of world's busiest container ports|container]], [[List of world's busiest ports by cargo tonnage|cargo]] and [[transshipment]]. The urban area straddles the small [[Río de la Miel]], which is the southernmost river of continental Europe. As of 1 January 2020, the municipality had a registered population of 123,078, second in its province after [[Jerez de la Frontera]] and greater than [[Cádiz]] city population.<ref name=rel /> It forms part of the [[Comarcas of Spain|''comarca'']] of [[Campo de Gibraltar]].

The surrounding metro area also includes the municipalities of [[Los Barrios]], [[La Línea de la Concepción]], [[Castellar de la Frontera]], [[Jimena de la Frontera]], [[San Roque, Cádiz|San Roque]] and [[Tarifa]], with a population of 263,739.<ref>[http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/viviendayordenaciondelterritorio/www/servlet/descargacopt?up=14660 Plan de Ordenación del Territorio del Área del Campo de Gibraltar] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615153009/http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/viviendayordenaciondelterritorio/www/servlet/descargacopt?up=14660 |date=2011-06-15 }}, [[Junta de Andalucía]] (Spanish)</ref>

==Name==
The Arabic name for the settlement founded by Muslims after the [[Muslim conquest of the Iberian Peninsula|conquest of the Iberian Peninsula]] was {{lang|ar-Latn|al-Jazīrah al-Khaḍrāʾ}} ({{Lang|ar|الجزيرة الخضراء}}, "The Green Island"), in reference to [[Fuerte de Isla Verde|Isla Verde]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Algeciras {{!}} Spain|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Algeciras|access-date=2021-05-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> {{lang|ar-Latn|Al-Jazīra(t)}} gave the modern Spanish {{lang|es|Algeciras}}.<ref>José Soto Chica y Ana María Berenjeno (2014). «La última posesión bizantina en la península ibérica: Mesopotamenoi-Mesopotaminoi.

In the later [[Spania|"Byzantine" period]], the site would come to be known in Greek as {{lang|grc-Latn|Mesopotámenoi}} ({{lang|grc|Μεσοποτάμενοι}}), meaning "between rivers/canals".

==History==
{{Main|History of Algeciras}}
The area of the city has been populated since prehistory, and the earliest remains belong to [[Neanderthal]] populations from the [[Paleolithic]] era.
[[File:Yacimientos romanos de Algeciras.png|thumb|230px|Map of the Roman (purple) and Punic (orange) sites in the municipality of Algeciras.]]
Due to its strategic position it was an important port under the [[Phoenicia]]ns, and was the site of the relevant Roman port of ''Portus Albus'' ("White Port"), with two nearby cities called ''Caetaria'' (possibly founded by the [[Iberians]]) and ''[[Iulia Traducta]]'', founded by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]].<ref name="O'Shea1865">{{cite book|last=O'Shea|first=Henry George|title=A Guide to Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qjIBAAAAQAAJ&pg=PA91|access-date=23 August 2012|year=1865|publisher=Longmans, Green|page=91}}</ref>

After being destroyed by the [[Migration Period|Goths]] and their [[Vandal]] allies,{{citation needed|date=May 2021}} the city was under the control of the Visigothic kingdom until  [[Tariq ibn Ziyad|Tarik]] landed in Algeciras and Tarifa in April 711.<ref name="Livermore2006">{{cite book|last=Livermore|first=Harold|title=The Twilight of the Goths: The Rise and Fall of the Kingdom of Toledo C.575–711|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zuPdApNNFQ4C&pg=PT101|access-date=23 August 2012|date=1 October 2006|publisher=Intellect Books|isbn=978-1-84150-966-2|page=101}}</ref>

In the year 859 AD Viking troops on board 62 [[drekar]]s and commanded by the leaders [[Hastein]] and [[Björn Ironside]] besieged the city for three days and subsequently laid waste to much of it. After looting the houses of the rich, they burnt the Aljama mosque and the Banderas mosque. Reorganized near the medina, the inhabitants managed to recover the city and make the invaders run away, capturing two boats.

It enjoyed a brief period of independence as a [[taifa]] state from 1035 to 1058. It was named ''al-Jazirah al-Khadra''' ("Green Island") after the offshore [[Isla Verde, Algeciras|Isla Verde]]; the modern name is derived from this original [[Arabic language|Arabic]] name (compare also [[Algiers]] and [[Al Jazeera Arabic|Al Jazeera]]). In 1055 Emir Al-Mutadid of Seville drove the Berbers from Algeciras, claiming it for Arabs.

Vowing to counter the Castilian expansion initiated by 1265, [[Emirate of Granada|Nasrid Granada]] required assistance from Fez in late 1274 and ceded the place of Algeciras (together with Tarifa) to the [[Marinid]]s.{{Sfn|García Fernández|1987|p=61}}
{{See also|Battle of the Strait}}
In 1278, Algeciras was [[Siege of Algeciras (1278)|besieged by the forces of the Kingdom of Castile]] under the command of [[Alfonso X of Castile]] and his son, [[Sancho IV of Castile|Sancho]].<ref name="Rogers2010">{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Clifford|title=The Oxford Encyclopedia of Medieval Warfare and Military Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mzwpq6bLHhMC&pg=PA33|access-date=23 August 2012|date=21 June 2010|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-533403-6|page=33 and 209}}</ref> This siege was the first of a series of attempts to take the city and ended in failure for the Castilian forces. An armada sent by Castile was also annihilated whilst trying to [[Battle of Algeciras (1278)|blockade the city's harbor]].

The Marinid grip over the town further increased in the ensuing decades, and the place turned into a Marinid stronghold from which [[Raid (military)|razzia]]s were launched into the still incipient Christian settlements in the Lower Guadalquivir and the Guadalete area.{{Sfn|García Fernández|1987|p=62}}

In July 1309, [[Ferdinand IV of Castile]] laid the first [[Siege of Algeciras (1309)|Siege of Algeciras]] as well as [[Gibraltar]].<ref name="Rogers2010"/> The latter fell into Christian hands, but Muslim Algeciras held on for the following three decades, until [[Alfonso XI]] of [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] began a second [[Siege of Algeciras (1342–1344)|Siege of Algeciras]] in 1342. [[Juan Núñez III de Lara|Juan Núñez de Lara]], [[Juan Manuel, Prince of Villena|Juan Manuel]], [[Pedro Fernández de Castro]], [[Juan Alfonso de la Cerda]], lord of [[Gibraleón]] all participated in the siege, as did knights from France, England and Germany, and even King [[Philip III of Navarre]], king consort of Navarra, who came accompanied by 100 horsemen and 300 infantry. In March 1344, after several years of siege, Algeciras surrendered.<ref name="O'Shea1865"/>

On winning the city, Alfonso XI made it the seat of a new [[diocese]], established by [[Pope Clement VI]]'s [[papal bull|bull]] ''Gaudemus et exultamus'' of 30 April 1344, and entrusted to the governance of the bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Cadiz y Ceuta|Cadiz]].<ref>[http://institucional.us.es/revistas/historia/34/03%20charlo.pdf Bulas fundacionales de la Diócesis de Cádiz (III). La creación de la Diócesis de Algeciras]</ref> The bishops of Cadiz continued to hold the title of Aliezira, as it called, until 1851, when in accordance with a [[concordat]] between Spain and the Holy See its territory was incorporated into the diocese of Cadiz. No longer a residential bishopric, Aliezira is today listed by the [[Catholic Church]] as a [[titular see]].<ref>''Annuario Pontificio 2013'' (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2013 {{ISBN|978-88-209-9070-1}}), p. 829</ref>

Left relatively unguarded during the [[Castilian Civil War]], the town was easily seized in 1369 by the [[Nasrid dynasty|Nasrids]] from Granada with assistance from a [[Marinid Sultanate|Marinid]] fleet.{{Sfn|Gómez de Avellaneda Sabio|2018|p=101}} It was destroyed on the orders of [[Muhammed V]] of Granada.<ref name="ChaucerAndrew1993">{{cite book|last1=Chaucer|first1=Geoffrey|last2=Andrew|first2=Malcolm|title=The General Prologue|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DvaIjAF5LcQC&pg=PA67|access-date=23 August 2012|year=1993|publisher=University of Oklahoma Press|isbn=978-0-8061-2552-7|page=67}}</ref> While tradition asserts that it was torn down immediately after the 1369 occupation, the Nasrid [[scorched-earth policy]] has been also dated to 1375, once Granadan repopulation efforts should have failed.{{Sfn|Gómez de Avellaneda Sabio|2018|p=110; 112}} The garrison was thus relocated to Gibraltar, with a worse port but more easily defensible, in Nasrid control after the Marinid retreat from the Iberian Peninsula.{{Sfn|Gómez de Avellaneda Sabio|2018|pp=109–110}} While the jurisdiction was ceded to Gibraltar in 1462 after the Castilian conquest of the latter place, there are hints about the continued existence of informal settlements by farmers and sepherds in the area, at least after 1466.{{Sfn|Ocaña Torres|Sáez Rodríguez|Castillo Navarro|Gómez Arroquia|2001|p=18}}

[[File:Algecirasdestruida.jpg|thumb|right|Illustration drawn {{Circa|1716}} depicting the ruins of Algeciras.]]
Algeciras was refounded after 1704 by refugees from Gibraltar following the territory's capture by Anglo-Dutch forces in the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]. As early as 1705, the place was described as "...a heap of stones,...only a few hovels scattered here and there, amidst an infinity of ruins".{{Sfn|Ocaña Torres|Sáez Rodríguez|Castillo Navarro|Gómez Arroquia|2001|p=18}} The sense of temporariness among the displaced population and the hopes for a return to Gibraltar were shattered by the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht.{{Sfn|Ocaña Torres|Sáez Rodríguez|Castillo Navarro|Gómez Arroquia|2001|p=19}} Besides Gibraltarians, throughout the 18th century repopulation was also participated by settlers from the rest of the Iberian Peninsula and from elsewhere, standing out Italians in the latter regard.{{sfn|Ocaña Torres|Sáez Rodríguez|Castillo Navarro|Gómez Arroquia|2001|pp=53}} Population rapidly increased (from 1,845 in 1725 to 6,241 in 1787).{{sfn|Ocaña Torres|Sáez Rodríguez|Castillo Navarro|Gómez Arroquia|2001|p=62}} The Algeciras' social structure featured a comparatively small number of nobles and comparatively larger weight of clergy.{{sfn|Ocaña Torres|Sáez Rodríguez|Castillo Navarro|Gómez Arroquia|2001|pp=6364}} Just like the rest of the Campo de Gibraltar, [[husbandry]] (cattle in particular) played an important role in the economy during the 18th century thanks to the rich pastures.{{sfn|Ocaña Torres|Sáez Rodríguez|Castillo Navarro|Gómez Arroquia|2001|p=72}} Given the abundance of international conflicts in the Strait area during the 18th century, corsair activities against ships belligerent with Spain or neutral ships provisioning the enemy also became an important part of the economy.{{sfn|Ocaña Torres|Sáez Rodríguez|Castillo Navarro|Gómez Arroquia|2001|pp=83–86}}

It was fortified to guard against British raids with installations such as the [[Fuerte de Isla Verde]] built to guard key points. The city was rebuilt on its present rectangular plan by [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] in 1760. In July 1801, the French and Spanish navies fought the British [[Royal Navy]] offshore in the [[Algeciras Campaign|Battle of Algeciras]], which ended in a British victory.<ref name="Musteen2011">{{cite book|last=Musteen|first=Jason R.|title=Nelson's Refuge: Gibraltar in the Age of Napoleon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HThZ_inxa14C&pg=PT43|access-date=23 August 2012|date=15 October 2011|publisher=Naval Institute Press|isbn=978-1-61251-084-2|page=43}}</ref>

In 1982 there was a failed plan codenamed [[Operation Algeciras]] conceived by the [[Argentina|Argentinian]] military to sabotage the British military facilities in Gibraltar during the [[Falklands War]]. The Spanish authorities intervened just before the attack, and deported the two Argentine [[Montoneros]] and military liaison officer involved.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/24/gibraltar.falklands|title= Falklands war nearly spread to Gibraltar|author=Tremlett, Giles|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=24 July 2004|access-date=23 August 2012}}</ref>

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
[[File:Algeciras mapa topográfico.png|thumb|Topographic map of the municipality]]
Algeciras is located in the southern end of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], in the ''comarca'' of [[Campo de Gibraltar]]. Its strategic location near the [[Strait of Gibraltar]]—the choke point connecting the Atlantic Ocean and the [[Mediterranean Sea]] also entailing the nearest distance between Europe and the [[African continent]]—has historically powered the importance of the port.<ref name=SCIPA>{{Cite web|url=http://www.paisajeyterritorio.es/assets/a2-07.-campo-de-gibraltar.pdf|page=286|title=Campo de Gibraltar|publisher=Centro de Estudios Paisaje y Territorio|location=Seville}}</ref> The city proper lies on the western bank of the [[Bay of Gibraltar]], fronting the [[Rock of Gibraltar]], which dominates the eastern bank.

The municipality spans across a total area of {{cvt|87.96|km2}},<ref name=rel>{{Cite web|url=https://ssweb.seap.minhap.es/REL/frontend/inicio/municipios/1/13386|publisher=[[Ministry of Economy (Spain)|Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos y Transformación Digital]]|title=Datos del Registro de Entidades Locales|access-date=3 May 2021}}</ref> bordering with the municipalities of [[Los Barrios]] and [[Tarifa]]. The lower course of the river [[Palmones (river)|Palmones]] forms part of the boundary of Algeciras with the municipality of Los Barrios.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dipucadiz.es/export/sites/default/agencia_provincial_de_la_energia/Programa-Costera/Documentacion/190626_Recomendaciones.pdf|page=60|publisher=Diputación de Cádiz|year=2019|title=Recomendaciones para la Adaptación de los Municipios Litorales Gaditanos a los Efectos del Cambio Climático}}</ref>

The urban agglomeration formed by Algeciras and the surrounding settlements is the sixth largest in [[Andalusia]] and the third largest off the region's coast.<ref name=SCIPA />

===Climate===
Algeciras has a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] [[subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'') with very mild, rainy winters and warm, dry summers with occasional heat waves, and temperature fluctuations are small because of the strong [[Oceanic climate|Oceanic]] influence. There are no snow registers in the city since the 19th century.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://foro.tiempo.com/olas-de-frio-entradas-frias-y-temporales-de-nieve-en-espana-1830-1985-t91237.0.html|title=OLAS DE FRÍO, ENTRADAS FRÍAS Y TEMPORALES DE NIEVE EN ESPAÑA 1830 - 1985|date=5 July 2008|access-date=9 May 2019|work=Tiempo|language=es}}</ref>

<!--[[File:Getares.jpg|thumb|right|Playa de Getares in Algeciras ([[:es:Playa de Getares|es]])]]-->
Algeciras is principally a transport hub and industrial city. Its main activities are connected with the [[Port of Algeciras]], which serves as the main embarkation point between Spain and [[Tangier]] and other ports in Morocco as well as the [[Canary Islands]] and the Spanish enclaves of [[Ceuta]] and [[Melilla]]. It is ranked as the 16th busiest port in the world. The city also has a substantial fishing industry and exports a range of agricultural products from the surrounding area, including cereals, tobacco and farm animals.

In recent years it has become a significant tourist destination, with popular day trips to [[Tarifa]] to see bird migrations; to Gibraltar to see the territory's sights and culture; and to the [[Bay of Gibraltar]] on [[whale watching]] excursions.

Algeciras is the southern terminus of two principal north–south [[Euroroute]]s, the [[European route E05|E05]] and [[European route E15|E15]]. Both routes, moreover, run to Scotland (the E05 terminates at [[Greenock]] and the E15 at [[Inverness]]) via France and England.
