Founded by the [[Ancient Romans|Romans]] in the late 1st century BC as ''[[Augusta Treverorum]]'' ("The City of [[Augustus]] among the [[Treveri]]"), Trier is considered Germany's oldest city.<ref name="Trier website">{{cite web |url=http://redaktion.trier.de/praefectus/trier?tourist_en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020808151331/http://redaktion.trier.de/praefectus/trier?tourist_en |archive-date=2002-08-08 |url-status=dead |title=Stadt Trier – City of Trier – La Ville de Trèves &#124; Website of the Municipality of Trier |author=Rathaus der Stadt Trier |access-date=2015-08-26 }}</ref>{{refn|An honor that is contested by [[Cologne]], [[Kempten]], and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]].}} It is also the oldest [[cathedral|seat]] of a [[bishop]] north of the [[Alps]].

The archbishop-elector of Trier also had great significance as one of the seven [[prince-elector|electors]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Because of its significance during the Roman and Holy Roman empires, several monuments and cathedrals within Trier are listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]].<ref name = "unesco">{{cite web |url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/367 |title = Roman Monuments, Cathedral of St Peter and Church of Our Lady in Trier |website = UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher = United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization |access-date = 22 May 2022}}</ref>

With an approximate population of 110,000, Trier is the fourth-largest city in its state, after [[Mainz]], [[Ludwigshafen]], and [[Koblenz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.statistik.rlp.de/fileadmin/dokumente/berichte/A1033_201022_hj_G.pdf|title=Bevölkerung der Gemeinden am 31.12.2010|work=[[Statistisches Landesamt Rheinland-Pfalz]]|year=2011|language=de|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131082852/http://www.statistik.rlp.de/fileadmin/dokumente/berichte/A1033_201022_hj_G.pdf|archive-date=2012-01-31}}</ref> The nearest major cities are [[Luxembourg City]] ({{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} to the southwest), [[Saarbrücken]] ({{convert|80|km|0|abbr=off|disp=or}} southeast), and [[Koblenz]] ({{convert|100|km|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} northeast).

The [[University of Trier]], the administration of the [[Trier-Saarburg]] district and the seat of the ADD (''Aufsichts- und Dienstleistungsdirektion''), which until 1999 was the borough authority of Trier, and the [[Academy of European Law]] (ERA) are all based in Trier. It is one of the five "[[Central place theory|central places]]" of the state of Rhineland-Palatinate. Along with Luxembourg, [[Metz]] and Saarbrücken, fellow constituent members of the {{ill|QuattroPole|de}} union of cities, it is central to the greater region encompassing [[Saar-Lor-Lux]] ([[Saarland]], [[Lorraine]] and [[Luxembourg]]), Rhineland-Palatinate, and [[Wallonia]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Trier}}
The first traces of human settlement in the area of the city show evidence of [[Linear Pottery culture|linear pottery]] settlements dating from the early [[Neolithic]] period. Since the last [[Christianization|pre-Christian]] centuries, members of the [[Celt]]ic tribe of the [[Treveri]] settled in the area of today's Trier.<ref>See: Heinen, pp. 1–12.</ref> The city of Trier derives its name from the later Latin locative ''in Trēverīs'' for earlier ''Augusta Treverorum''. According to the [[Archbishops of Trier]], in the [[Gesta Treverorum]], the founder of the city of the Trevians is [[Trebeta]]. German historian [[Johannes Aventinus]] also credited [[Trebeta]] with building settlements at [[Metz]], [[Mainz]], [[Basel]], [[Strasbourg]], [[Speyer]] and [[Worms, Germany|Worms]].

The historical record describes the [[Roman Empire]] subduing the [[Treveri]] in the {{nowrap|1st century BC}} and establishing Augusta Treverorum about 16 BC.<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.uni-trier.de/index.php?id=12675&L=2|title=The City of Trier|publisher=Trier University|access-date=11 May 2019}}</ref> The name distinguished it from the empire's [[Augusta (disambiguation)#Places|many other cities]] honoring the first [[Roman emperor]], [[Augustus]].

In the 4th century, Trier was one of the largest cities in the Roman Empire with a population around 75,000 and perhaps as much as 100,000.<ref name="landesmuseum-trier">{{cite web|url=http://www.landesmuseum-trier.de/lib/02_Programm/antikencard-trier-englisch-2012.pdf|date=8 March 2012|title=TRIER THE CENTER OF ANTIQUITY IN GERMANY|access-date=2015-08-26|archive-date=2018-12-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181225061853/http://www.landesmuseum-trier.de/de/home.html|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="google">{{cite book|title=Europe by Eurail 2010: Touring Europe by Train|author=LaVerne, F.K.|date=1991|publisher=Globe Pequot Press|isbn=9780762761630|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ux7EOl11e34C&pg=PA337 |page=337|access-date=2015-08-26}}</ref><ref name="google books">{{cite book|title=BEYOND OUR WORLD: The Exciting Story of a Treasure Hunter, Historian, and Adventurer |author=Baker, Myron|date=2013|publisher=Dorrance Publishing Co |isbn=9781480901872|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KbuYAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA182 |page=182|access-date=2021-01-04}}</ref><ref name="academia">{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1166147 |title=The Fall and Decline of the Roman Urban Mind &#124; Svante Fischer and Helena Victor - Academia.edu |publisher=academia.edu|access-date=2015-08-26|last1=Victor |first1=Helena |last2=Fischer |first2=Svante }}</ref> The [[Porta Nigra]] ("Black Gate") dates from this era. A residence of the [[Western Roman emperor]], Roman Trier was the birthplace of [[Saint Ambrose]]. Sometime between 395 and 418, probably in 407 the Roman administration moved the staff of the Praetorian Prefecture from Trier to [[Arles]]. The city continued to be inhabited but was not as prosperous as before. However, it remained the seat of a governor and had state factories for the production of [[ballistae]] and [[Roman armor|armor]] and [[Roman military uniform|woolen uniforms]] for [[Roman soldiers|the troops]], clothing for the civil service, and high-quality garments for the Court. Northern Gaul was held by the Romans along a line [[Limes (Roman Empire)|(''līmes'')]] from north of [[Cologne]] to the coast at [[Boulogne]] through what is today southern Belgium until 460. South of this line, Roman control was firm, as evidenced by the continuing operation of the imperial arms factory at [[Amiens]].

The [[Franks]] seized Trier from Roman administration in 459. In 870, it became part of [[Eastern Francia]], which developed into the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Relics of [[Saint Matthias]] brought to the city initiated widespread pilgrimages. The bishops of the city grew increasingly powerful and the [[Archbishopric of Trier]] was recognized as an [[Elector of Trier|electorate]] of the empire, one of the most powerful states of Germany. The [[University of Trier]] was founded in the city in 1473. In the 17th century, the Archbishops and Prince-Electors of Trier relocated their residence to [[Philippsburg]] Castle in [[Festung Ehrenbreitstein|Ehrenbreitstein]], near [[Koblenz]]. A session of the [[Reichstag (Holy Roman Empire)|Reichstag]] was held in Trier in 1512, during which the demarcation of the [[Imperial Circle]]s was definitively established.

In the years from 1581 to 1593, the [[Trier witch trials]] were held. It was one of the four largest witch trials in Germany alongside the [[Fulda witch trials]], the [[Würzburg witch trial]], and the [[Bamberg witch trials]], perhaps even the largest one in European history. The persecutions started in the diocese of Trier in 1581 and reached the city itself in 1587, where it was to lead to the death of about 368 people, and was as such perhaps the biggest mass execution in Europe in peacetime. This counts only those executed within the city itself. The exact number of people executed in all the witch hunts within the diocese has never been established; a total of 1,000 has been suggested but not confirmed.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the [[French-Habsburg rivalry]] brought war to Trier. [[Habsburg Spain|Spain]] and [[Kingdom of France|France]] fought over the city during the [[Thirty Years' War]]. The bishop was imprisoned by Spain and the Holy Roman Emperor for his support for France between 1635 and 1645. In later wars between the Empire and France, French troops occupied the city during the [[Nine Years' War]], the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], and the [[War of the Polish Succession]]. After conquering Trier again in 1794 during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], France annexed the city and the electoral archbishopric was dissolved. After the [[Napoleonic Wars]] ended in 1815, Trier passed to the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]. [[Karl Marx]], the German philosopher and one of the founders of [[Marxism]], was born in the city in 1818.

As part of the [[Prussian Rhineland]], Trier developed economically during the 19th century. The city rose in revolt during the [[revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], although the rebels were forced to concede. It became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871.

The synagogue on Zuckerbergstrasse was looted during the November 1938 [[Kristallnacht]] and later completely destroyed in a bomb attack in 1944. Multiple [[Stolperstein]] have been installed in Trier to commemorate those murdered and exiled during the [[Shoah]].<ref>[[:de:Liste der Stolpersteine in Trier|List of Stolperstein in Trier]] (in German).</ref>

In June 1940 during [[World War II]] over 60,000 British prisoners of war, captured at [[Operation Dynamo|Dunkirk]] and Northern France, were marched to Trier, which became a staging post for British soldiers headed for German [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s. Trier was heavily bombed and bombarded in 1944. The city became part of the new state of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] after the war. The [[University of Trier|university]], dissolved in 1797, was restarted in the 1970s, while the [[Cathedral of Trier]] was reopened in 1974 after undergoing substantial and long-lasting renovations. Trier officially celebrated its 2,000th anniversary in 1984. On [[2020 Trier attack|1 December 2020]], 5 people were killed by an allegedly drunk driver during a [[vehicle-ramming attack]].<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-55148518 Trier: Five die as car ploughs through Germany pedestrian zone]. bbc.com. Retrieved 2021-01-04.</ref> 
The Ehrang/Quint district of Trier was heavily damaged and flooded during the 16 July [[2021 European floods|2021 floods]] of Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Luxembourg.

Trier sits in a hollow midway along the [[Moselle (river)|Moselle]] valley, with the most significant portion of the city on the east bank of the river. Wooded and [[vineyard]]-covered slopes stretch up to the [[Hunsrück]] plateau in the south and the [[Eifel]] in the north. The border with the [[Luxembourg|Grand Duchy of Luxembourg]] is some {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}} away.

== Organization of city districts ==
[[File:Ortsbezirke-trier.png|thumb|Districts of Trier]]
The Trier urban area is divided into '''19 city districts'''. For each district there is an ''[[:de:Ortsbeirat|Ortsbeirat]]'' (local council) of between 9 and 15 members, as well as an ''[[:de:Ortsvorsteher|Ortsvorsteher]]'' (local representative). The local councils are charged with hearing the important issues that affect the district, although the final decision on any issue rests with the city council. The local councils nevertheless have the freedom to undertake limited measures within the bounds of their districts and their budgets.

==Climate ==
Trier has an oceanic climate ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfb''), but with greater extremes than the marine versions of [[northern Germany]]. Summers are warm except in unusual heat waves and winters are recurrently cold, but not harsh. Precipitation is high despite not being on the coast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=106090&cityname=Trier,+Rheinland-Pfalz,+Germany&units=|title=Trier, Germany Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=2019-02-02}}{{Dead link|date=July 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As a result of the [[2003 European heat wave|European heat wave in 2003]], the highest temperature recorded was 39&nbsp;°C on 8 August of that year.
