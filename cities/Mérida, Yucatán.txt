[[File:Letras de Mérida, Yuc.jpg|thumb|upright|The "''Pasaje de la Revolución''" (Passage of the Revolution) designed by the Italian architect Giaccomo Piccone and inaugurated in 1918]]

Mérida was named after [[Mérida, Spain]] because the Maya ruins that the Spanish [[conquistador]]s found in the settlement of [[Ti'ho]] reminded them of the Roman ruins of [[Augusta Emerita]]. Over time, the city acquired the nickname "''La Ciudad Blanca''" (The White City).{{citation needed|date=April 2024}} This nickname may be due to the white color of the [[limestone]] used to paint the façades of the city's colonial buildings. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the city can be seen from outer space as a large whitish area in the middle of the immense green forest that covers the Yucatán Peninsula.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.esa.int/Applications/Observing_the_Earth/Earth_from_Space_Mexico_s_White_City|title=Earth from Space: Mexico's 'White City'|website=European Space Agency|date=2006-05-04|access-date=2023-03-31}}</ref> Other cities in Hispanic America share the same nickname for this reason, like [[Arequipa]]<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-08-06 |title=¿Qué significa Arequipa, nombre de la 'Ciudad Blanca' del Perú? |url=https://www.infobae.com/america/peru/2022/08/06/que-significa-arequipa-nombre-de-la-ciudad-blanca-del-peru/ |access-date=2024-04-20 |website=infobae |language=es-ES}}</ref> and [[Popayán|Popayan]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Romoleroux |first=Michell Francois |date=2022-01-06 |title=¿Por qué a Popayán le dicen la Ciudad Blanca? |url=https://www.eltiempo.com/colombia/otras-ciudades/la-razon-por-la-que-popayan-es-la-ciudad-blanca-643448 |access-date=2024-04-20 |website=El Tiempo |language=spanish}}</ref> Folktale says that the name go back to the founding of the city when the Spanish conquistadors – motivated by security reasons and given the persistent rebellion of the [[Maya peoples#Maya people of the Yucatan Peninsula|indigenous Maya people]] – decided to allow only white-skinned Europeans to live in the city.

==History==
{{See also|Timeline of Mérida, Mexico}}
[[File:One of Merida's twin mansions “Las Casas Gemelas”.jpg|thumb|One of Merida's twin mansions, known as the [[Cámara Houses]] or "Las Casas Gemelas"]]
[[File:Catedral de Merida 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Cathedral of Mérida, Yucatán|Cathedral of Mérida]] as it appeared in 2010]]

Mérida was founded in 1542 by the Spanish [[conquistador]]s, including [[Francisco de Montejo the Younger]] and [[Juan de la Cámara]], and named after the town of [[Mérida, Spain|Mérida]] in Extremadura, Spain. It was built on the site of the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] city of [[Ti'ho]] (/tʼχoʼ/), which was also called Ichkanzihóo or Ichcaanzihó (/iʃkan'siχo/; "City of Five Hills") in reference to its [[Mesoamerican pyramids|pyramids]]. Many of the carved stones of the ruins of ancient Ti'ho were used in the construction of the early Spanish buildings of Mérida. These stones are visible, for instance, in the walls of the main cathedral. From colonial times through the mid-19th century, Mérida was a walled city designed to protect the ''[[peninsulares]]'' and [[Criollo people|criollos]] from periodic revolts by the indigenous Maya people.

In the late 19th century, the area surrounding Mérida prospered from the cultivation of [[Agave fourcroydes|henequen]], the fiber of which was used in the production of [[rope]] and [[twine]], as well as for the production of ''licor del henequén'', a traditional Mexican alcoholic drink. By the beginning of the 20th century, manufacturing focused mainly on tobacco, molasses, rum, soap, and leather products.<ref>{{Cite NSRW |wstitle= Merida |volume= III |page= 1207 | last= |first= |author-link= |year=1914| short=1}}</ref>  [[Koreans in Mexico|Korean immigration]] to Mexico began in 1905 when more than a thousand people arrived in Yucatán from the city of [[Incheon|Jemulpo]]. These first Korean immigrants settled around Mérida as workers in henequen plantations.

In August 1993, [[Pope John Paul II]] visited the city on his third trip to Mexico.<ref>''Fodor's 2001 Cancún, Cozumel, Yucatán Peninsula'' p.167. Fodor's, 2000</ref> The city has been host to two bilateral United States – Mexico conferences, the first in 1999 ([[Bill Clinton]] – [[Ernesto Zedillo]]) and the second in 2007 ([[George W. Bush]] – [[Felipe Calderón]], which resulted in the creation of the [[Mérida Initiative]]). Mérida hosted the VI Summit of [[Association of Caribbean States]] in April 2014. In recent years, important sports competitions have been held in Mérida, such as the [[Archery World Cup|World Cup]] of the [[World Archery Federation]]. The city has also hosted important scientific meetings such as the [[International Cosmic Ray Conference]].

==Geography==
Mérida is located in the northwest part of the state of Yucatán, which occupies the northern portion of the Yucatán Peninsula. To the north is [[Progreso, Yucatán|Progreso]] and the Gulf of Mexico. [[Valladolid, Yucatán|Valladolid]] and [[Tizimín]] are to the east, [[Celestún]] is to the west, and the city of [[Campeche (city)|Campeche]] is located to the southwest. There are many important Maya archae sites in the area, including [[Chichen Itza]], [[Uxmal]], [[Oxkintok]], [[Sayil]] and [[Kabah (Maya site)|Kabah]].

The city is located near the center of the [[Chicxulub Crater]]. It has a very flat topography and is only {{convert|30|ft|m|0|order=flip}} [[Height above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The land outside of Mérida is covered with smaller scrub trees and former henequen fields. Almost no surface water exists, but several [[cenote]]s ([[sinkhole]]s that provide access to underground springs and rivers) are found in the area.

Mérida has a ''centro histórico'' typical of colonial Spanish cities. The street grid is based on odd-numbered streets running east–west and even-numbered streets running north–south, with Calles 60 and 61 bounding the "Plaza Grande" in the heart of the city. The more affluent neighborhoods are located to the north and the most densely populated areas are to the south.

===Climate===
Mérida features a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen-Geiger climate classification system|Köppen]]: ''Aw'').<ref name=Peel>{{cite journal | author1=Peel, M. C. | author2=Finlayson, B. L. | author3=McMahon, T. A. | year=2007 | title= Updated world map of the Köppen–Geiger climate classification | journal=Hydrol. Earth Syst.

Mérida's climate is hot and its humidity is moderate to high, depending on the time of year. The average annual high temperature is {{convert|33.5|°C|°F|1}}, ranging from {{convert|30.6|°C|°F|1}} in December to {{convert|36.3|°C|°F|1}} in May, but temperatures often rise above {{convert|38|°C|°F|1}} in the afternoon during this period. Low temperatures range between {{convert|17.2|°C|°F|1}} in January to {{convert|21.7|°C|°F|1}} in May. It is most often a few degrees hotter in Mérida than in coastal areas due to its inland location and low elevation. The rainy season runs from June through October, associated with the Mexican monsoon which draws warm, moist air landward. [[tropical wave|Easterly wave]]s and tropical storms also affect the area during this season.

Mérida is the capital of the state of Yucatán. The offices of the [[governor of Yucatán]], the [[Congress of Yucatán]], and the Superior Court of Justice of Yucatán are all located within the city.

The municipal government is invested under the authority of a City Council (''Ayuntamiento'') which it is seated at the Municipal Palace of Merida, located in the historic center of the city. The City Council is presided by a municipal president or mayor, and an assembly conformed by a number of regents (''regidores'') and trustees (''síndicos'').

The city is home to important national and local [[research institute]]s, like the Yucatan Scientific Research Center (''Centro de Investigación Científica de Yucatán'', CICY) of the [[Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología (Mexico)|National Council of Science and Technology]] (''Consejo Nacional de Ciencia y Tecnología'', Conacyt), a unit of the [[CINVESTAV|Center for Research and Advanced Studies]] of the [[National Polytechnic Institute]] (''Centro de Investigación y de Estudios Avanzados'', CINVESTAV Unidad Mérida), the Dr. [[Hideyo Noguchi]] Regional Research Center (''Centro de Investigaciones Regionales Dr. Hideyo Noguchi'') of the [[Autonomous University of Yucatan]] (CIR-UADY), the Yucatán Science and Technology Park (''Parque Científico Tecnológico de Yucatán'', PCYTY) and the Peninsular Center for Humanities and Social Sciences (''Centro Peninsular en Humanidades y Ciencias Sociales'', CEPHCIS) of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM).

Mérida has served as the [[American Capital of Culture]] in the years 2000 and 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Walsh|first=Nora|title=A Guide To Merida, Mexico: 10 Reasons To Visit Now|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/norawalsh/2017/11/16/a-guide-to-merida-mexico-10-reasons-to-visit-now/|access-date=2020-09-02|website=Forbes|language=en}}</ref>

As the state and regional capital, Mérida is a cultural center, featuring multiple museums, art galleries, restaurants, movie theatres, and shops. Mérida retains an abundance of colonial buildings and is a cultural center with music and dancing playing an important part in day-to-day life. At the same time it is a modern city with a range of shopping malls, auto dealerships, hotels, restaurants, and leisure facilities. The famous avenue [[Paseo de Montejo]] is lined with original sculpture. Each year, the MACAY Museum in Mérida mounts a new sculpture installation, featuring works from Mexico and one other chosen country. Each exhibit remains for 10 months of the year. In 2007, sculptures on Paseo de Montejo featured works by artists from Mexico and Japan.

Mérida and the state of Yucatán have traditionally been isolated from the rest of the country by geography, creating a unique culture. The conquistadors found the Maya culture to be incredibly resilient, and their attempts to eradicate Maya tradition, religion, and culture had only moderate success. The surviving remnants of the Maya culture can be seen every day, in speech, dress, and in both written and oral histories. It is especially apparent in holidays like Hanal Pixan, a Maya/Catholic [[Day of the Dead]] celebration. It falls on November 1 and 2 (one day for adults, and one for children) and is commemorated by elaborate altars dedicated to dead relatives. It is a compromise between the two religions with crucifixes mingled with skull decorations and food sacrifices/offerings.  ''Múkbil pollo'' (pronounced/'mykβil pʰoʎoˀ/) is the Maya tamal pie offered to the dead on All Saints' Day, traditionally accompanied by a cup of hot chocolate. Many Yucatecans enjoy eating this on and around the Day of the Dead. And, while complicated to make, they can be purchased and even shipped via air.  (''Muk-bil'' literally means "to put in the ground" or to cook in a ''pib'', an underground oven).

For English speakers or would-be speakers, Mérida has the Mérida English Library,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meridaenglishlibrary.com |title=Merida English Library |publisher=Merida English Library |access-date=2009-05-05}}</ref> a lending library with an extensive collection of English books, videos, tapes, and children's books. The library is also the site for expatriate meetings, children's storytelling hours, and other cultural events.

Mérida is also home to the [[Yucatán Symphony Orchestra]], which plays regular seasons at the José Peón Contreras Theatre on Calle 60 and features classical music, jazz, and opera.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osy.org.mx/ |title=The Yucatan Symphony Orchestra |publisher=Osy.org.mx |access-date=2013-03-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081023201410/http://www.osy.org.mx/ |archive-date=October 23, 2008 }}</ref>

===Food===
Yucatán food is its own unique style and is very different from what most people consider "Mexican" food. It includes influences from the local Maya cuisine, as well as Caribbean, Mexican, European and Middle Eastern foods. Tropical fruit, such as coconut, pineapple, plum, tamarind and mamey are often used in Yucatán cuisine.

[[File:Papadzules at La Chaya Maya.jpg|thumb|''[[Papadzules]]'', a Maya meal consisting of pumpkin seed-soaked corn tortillas filled with egg, spices and other seasonings, is an ancient dish of the Yucatán.]]
There are many regional dishes. Some of them are:
*''[[Poc Chuc]]'', a Maya/Yucateco version of boiled/grilled pork
*''[[Salbut]]es'' and ''[[Panucho]]s''. ''Salbutes'' are soft, cooked tortillas with lettuce, tomato, turkey and avocado on top. ''Panuchos'' feature fried tortillas filled with black beans, and topped with turkey or chicken, lettuce, avocado and pickled onions. ''[[Habanero]]'' chiles accompany most dishes, either in solid or puréed form, along with fresh limes and corn tortillas.
*''Queso Relleno'' is a gourmet dish featuring ground pork inside of a carved [[Edamer|edam]] cheese ball served with tomato sauce
*''Pavo en Relleno Negro'' (also known locally as ''[[Chimole]]'') is turkey meat stew cooked with a black paste made from roasted chiles, a local version of the ''[[Mole (sauce)|mole]] de guajalote'' found throughout Mexico. The meat soaked in the black soup is also served in tacos, sandwiches and even in ''panuchos'' or ''salbutes''.
*''[[Lime soup|Sopa de Lima]]'' is a lime soup with a chicken broth base often accompanied by shredded chicken or turkey and crispy tortilla.
*''[[Papadzules]]'', egg tacos bathed with pumpkin seed sauce and tomatoes.
*''[[Cochinita pibil]]'' is a marinated pork dish, by far the most renowned from Yucatán, that is made with achiote. Achiote is a reddish spice with a distinctive flavor and peppery smell. It is also known by the Spanish (Recados) seasoning paste.
*''Bul keken'' (Mayan for "beans and pork") is a traditional black bean and pork soup. The soup is served in the home on Mondays in most Yucatán towns. The soup is usually served with chopped onions, radishes, chiles, and tortillas. This dish is also commonly referred to as ''frijol con puerco''.
*''Brazo de reina'' (Spanish for "The Queen's Arm") is a traditional tamal dish. A long, flat tamal is topped with ground pumpkin seeds and rolled up like a roll cake. The long roll is then cut into slices. The slices are topped with a tomato sauce and a pumpkin seed garnish.
*''Tamales colados'' is a traditional dish made with pork/chicken, banana leaf, fresh corn masa and achiote paste, seasoned with roasted tomato sauce.

[[Achiote]] is a popular spice in the area. It is derived from the hard [[Annatto|annatto seed]] found in the region. The whole seed is ground together with other spices and formed into a reddish seasoning paste, called ''recado rojo''. The other ingredients in the paste include cinnamon, allspice berries, cloves, [[Mexican oregano]], cumin seed, sea salt, mild black peppercorns, apple cider vinegar, and garlic.

Hot sauce in Mérida is usually made from the indigenous chiles in the area which include: Chile Xcatik, Chile Seco de Yucatán, and Chile Habanero.

===Language and accent===
The Spanish language spoken in the Yucatán is readily identifiable as different in comparison to the Spanish spoken all over the country, and even to non-native ears. It is heavily influenced by the [[Yucatec Maya language]], which is spoken by a third of the population of the State of Yucatán. The Mayan language is melodic, filled with ejective consonants (p', k', and t') and "sh" sounds (represented by the letter "x" in the Mayan language). Even though many people speak Mayan, there is much stigma associated with it. It can be seen that elders were associated with higher status with knowledge of the language, but the younger generation saw more negative attitudes with knowledge of the language<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal|last=Sima Lorenzo|first=Eyder Gabriel|date=August 9, 2013|title=Actitudes de Yucatecos Bilingues de Maya y Español Hacia la Lengua Maya y sis Hablantes en Merida Yucatan|journal=Estudios de Cultura Maya}}</ref> This was also in direct correlation with the socioeconomic status and their overall placement in society. There is also the idea that one is not speaking in the "correct" manner of legitimate Mayan dialect, which also causes for more differences in the accent and overall language of the area.<ref name=":0" />

Due to being enclosed by the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, and being somewhat isolated from the rest of Mexico, Yucatecan Spanish has also preserved many words that are no longer used in many other Spanish-speaking areas of the world. However, over the years with the improvement of transportation and technology with the presence of radio, internet, and TV, many elements of the culture and language of the rest of Mexico are now slowly but consistently permeating the culture.

Apart from the Mayan language, which is the mother-tongue of many Yucatecans, students now choose to learn a foreign language such as English, which is taught in most schools.

==Main sights==
===Historic sites===
[[File:Casa de Montejo Merida enero 2012.jpg|thumb|upright|House of Montejo]]

Modern Mérida has expanded far beyond its original city walls, but many old [[Spanish Colonial architecture|Spanish colonial buildings]] and several old city gates can still be seen in the ''[[Old town|centro histórico]]'', which is among the largest in the Americas. Many large and elaborate homes from the early 20th century still line the main avenue called ''[[Paseo de Montejo]]''. For example, "Las Casas Gemelas" (The Twin Houses) are two side-by-side French and Spanish style mansions completed in 1911 by Camilo and Ernesto Cámara Zavala. Owned by the Barbachano and Molina Méndez families, they are two of only a few houses that are still used as residences on Paseo Montejo from that era. During the [[Porfiriato]], the Barbachano house held cultural events that hosted artists, poets, and writers. In the mid-1900s, the Barbachanos hosted aristocrats including [[Grace Kelly|Princess Grace]] and [[Rainier III, Prince of Monaco|Prince Ranier]], as well as first lady of the U.S., [[Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|Jacqueline Kennedy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://historicalmx.org/items/show/6|title=The Camara Brothers' Twin Houses |publisher=Sam Houston State University|access-date=2020-04-06}}</ref>

The historical center of Mérida is currently undergoing a renaissance, as people and businesses move into these old buildings and restore them.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-zmerida21oct21,1,4700207.story?coll=la-headlines-business |title=Paradise for home remodelers – Los Angeles Times |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=October 21, 2007 |access-date=2009-05-05 | first=Marla | last=Dickerson}}</ref> Many of these restored buildings now serve as office buildings for banks and insurance companies.

The city is home to the [[Mérida Marathon]], held each year since 1986.<ref>{{cite web |title=Marathon Mérida BaNorte |url=http://www.marathonmerida.com/index.phpx |accessdate=March 3, 2021}}</ref>

==Transportation==

=== Bus ===
[[File:Yellow bus - Merida Yuc Mex.jpg|thumb|A bus on street 62]]
[[File:Unidad Ietram Va y Ven.jpg|thumb|An Ie-Tram unit in 2023]]
City service is mostly provided by four local transportation companies: Unión de Camioneros de Yucatán (UCY), Alianza de Camioneros de Yucatán (ACY), Rápidos de Mérida, and Minis 2000. Bus transportation is at the same level or better than that of bigger cities like [[Guadalajara]] or [[Mexico City]]. Climate-controlled buses and micro-buses (smaller in size) are not uncommon.

As of 2024 the privately owned city bus system is being replaced by a new municipal system called "Va y Ven".<ref>{{cite news|title=Mérida New Va y Ven Transit Network is a Huge Step in the Right Direction |author=Carlos Rosado van der Gracht |date=November 22, 2023 |work=Yucatán Magazine |url=https://yucatanmagazine.com/merida-new-va-y-ven-transit-network-is-a-huge-step-in-the-right-direction/}}</ref>

[[Ie-Tram Yucatán]] is a [[bus rapid transit]] (BRT) system opening in December 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Yucatán estrenará en 2023, IE-TRAM, transporte público 100% eléctrico |url=http://energy21.com.mx/index.php/renovables/2022/06/10/yucatan-estrenara-en-2023-ie-tram-transporte-publico-100-electrico |access-date=2022-11-20 |website=energy21.com.mx |language=es}}</ref>

The main bus terminal (CAME) offers first-class ([[Autobuses de oriente|ADO]]) and luxury services (ADO PLATINO, ADO GL) to most southern Mexico cities outside Yucatán with a fleet consisting of Mercedes Benz and Volvo buses. Shorter intrastate routes are serviced by many smaller terminals around the city, mainly in downtown.

===Taxis===
Several groups and unions offer taxi transportation: Frente Único de los Trabajadores del Volante (FUTV) (white taxis), Unión de Taxistas Independientes (UTI), and Radiotaxímetros de Yucatán, among others. Some of them offer metered service, but most work based on a flat rate depending on destination. Competition has made it of more common use than it was years ago.

Taxis can be either found at one of many predefined places around the city (Taxi de Sitio), waved down along the road, or called in by radio. Unlike the sophisticated RF counterparts in the US, a Civil Band radio is used and is equally effective. Usually a taxi will respond and arrive within 5 minutes.

Another type of taxi service is called "Colectivo". Colectivo taxis work like small buses on a predefined route and for a small fare. Usually accommodating 8 to 10 people.

[[Uber]], [[DiDi]], and [[inDrive]] also offer services in Mérida.

===Air===
[[File:MID 3.JPG|thumb|Merida Manuel Crescencio Rejón International Airport: a view of the check-in room]]
Mérida (IATA: MID, ICAO: MMMD) is serviced by [[Manuel Crescencio Rejón International Airport]] with daily non-stop services to major cities in Mexico including Mexico City, Monterrey, Villahermosa, Cancún, Guadalajara, Tuxtla Gutierrez, and Toluca. The airport has international flights to Miami, Houston, La Havana and Toronto.  {{As of|2006}} more than 1 million passengers were using this airport every year, (1.3 in 2007).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tráfico de Pasajeros {{!}} Tráfico de Pasajeros |url=http://www.asur.com.mx/es/inversionistas/trafico-de-pasajeros.html |access-date=2022-08-05 |website=www.asur.com.mx}}</ref> The airport is under ASUR administration.

===Train===
Mérida was the hub of an extensive [[Ferrocarriles Unidos de Yucatán|narrow gauge railway network]] that operated in the states of Yucatán and Campeche beginning in 1902. This system was merged into [[Ferrocarriles Unidos del Sureste]] in 1975, and later merged into [[Ferrocarriles Chiapas-Mayab]]. In 2016, The Secretary of Communications and Transportation revoked the concession.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tribuna.com.mx/nota.php?n=21110 |title=Tribuna del Yaqui |website=tribuna.com.mx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160825193818/http://www.tribuna.com.mx/nota.php?n=21110 |archive-date=2016-08-25}}</ref>

Current passenger train service to Mérida is provided by [[Tren Maya]] which runs from [[Palenque, Chiapas]] to [[Cancún, Quintana Roo]], continuing on to [[Playa del Carmen]]. It stops at [[Teya Mérida railway station]], {{cvt|8|km}} east of the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sinembargo.mx/06-10-2023/4418099|title=El 15 de diciembre inicia ruta Palenque-Cancún; todos los tramos, para febrero: AMLO|language=es|website=sinembargo.mx|date=October 6, 2023|accessdate=October 23, 2023}}</ref>

===Roads===
Main roads in and out of Mérida:
* Mérida-Progreso (Federal 261), {{convert|33|km|0|abbr=off}} long with 8 lanes joins the city with Yucatán's biggest port city, [[Progreso, Yucatán|Progreso]].
* Mérida-Umán-Campeche (Federal 180) connects with the city of [[San Francisco de Campeche]].
* Mérida-Kantunil-Cancún (Federal 180), a four-lane road that becomes a toll road at Kantunil, joins Mérida with [[Chichén Itzá]], [[Valladolid, Yucatán|Valladolid]] and ultimately Cancún.
* Mérida-Tizimín (Federal 176) connects Mérida with Tizimín (the second largest city in Yucatán).
* Mérida-[[Municipality of Teabo|Teabo]]-Peto, known as Mundo Maya Road ''Carretera del Mundo Maya'', is used in both "convent route" [[Ruta de los Conventos]] and as a link to the ancient Maya city of [[Mayapán]] and [[Chetumal]], state capital of [[Quintana Roo]].

==Health==
[[File:Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad de Mérida.jpg|thumb|Entrance building of the Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad]]
Mérida has many regional hospitals and medical centers. All of them offer full services for the city, and in case of the regional hospitals, for the whole Yucatán peninsula and neighboring states.

The city has one of the more prestigious medical faculties in Mexico (UADY). Proximity to American cities like Houston allow local doctors to crosstrain and practice in both countries making Mérida one of the best cities in Mexico in terms of health services availability.

Hospitals:

* Public:
** Hospital Regional del [[ISSSTE]]
** Hospital Ignacio García Téllez [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS)
** Hospital Benito Juárez IMSS
** Hospital [[Agustin O'Horán]]
** Hospital Regional de Alta Especialidad
*Private:
** Clínica de Mérida
** Star Médica
** Centro Médico de las Américas (CMA)
** Centro de Especialidades Médicas
** Hospital Santelena
** Centro Médico Pensiones (CMP)
** Hospital Faro Del Mayab

==Education==
[[File:UADY.jpg|thumb|[[Autonomous University of Yucatán]]]]
In 2000, the Mérida municipality had 244 preschool institutions, 395 elementary, 136 Jr. high school (2 years middle school, 1 high), 97 High Schools and 16 Universities/Higher Education schools. Mérida has consistently held the status of having the best performing public schools in Mexico since 1996. The public school system is regulated by the Secretariat of Public Instruction.<ref name=":102">{{Cite news|url=https://www.expatsinmexico.com/merida-education/|title=Mérida Education – Expats In Mexico|work=Expats in Mexico|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}</ref> Attendance is required for all students in the educational system from age 6 up to age 15.<ref name=":102" /> Once students reach high school, they are given the option of continuing their education or not; if they chose to do so they are given two tracks in which they can graduate.<ref name=":102" />

Nevertheless, education in Merida has a variety of quality throughout the city. This mainly has to do with the different social strata and where they reside. Mayan indigenous population are at the bottom of the spectrum and this can be represented in the type of education that the children are receiving. Upper class is usually located in the north, as it is less populated and has higher living costs.<ref name=":9">{{Cite book|url=http://comey.yucatan.gob.mx/marco_files/II.6_Desarrollo_urbano_y_OT.pdf|title=Programa Integral de Desarrollo Metropolitano PIDEM}}</ref> For the most part, private schools are located in the northern part of the city. The only students who attend these schools are those of high class and of non-Maya descent.<ref name=":5">{{Cite journal|last=Azcorra|first=Hugo|date=2013|title=Nutritional Status of Maya Children, Their Mothers, and Their GrandmothersResiding in the City of Merida, Mexico: Revisiting the Leg-Length Hypothesis|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|volume=25|issue=5|pages=659–65|doi=10.1002/ajhb.22427|pmid=23907793|s2cid=205302992}}</ref> A distressing statistic of how this affects the indigenous communities can be noted, "In Yucatan only 8.9 % of the Mayans have achieved junior high and solely the 6.6% have studied beyond that point. The 83.4% of the Mayans 15 years old and older dropped out of school before finishing junior high."<ref name=":72">{{Cite conference|last=Mijangos-Noh|first=Juan Carlos|date=April 14, 2009|title=Racism Against the Mayan Population in Yucatan, Mexico: How Current Education Contradicts the Law|url=https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED505698.pdf|conference=Annual Meeting of the American Educational Research Association}}</ref>

Many laws have been set in place to avoid discrimination between the Spanish speakers and the Mayan speakers as the "Law says that it is a duty of the Mexican State to guarantee – guarantee, not just try, not just attempt – that the indigenous population has access to the obligatory education, bilingual and intercultural in their methods and contents."<ref name=":72"/> Despite this having been set into law, there is no bilingual or cultural accepting program after elementary school.<ref name=":72"/> The system for indigenous education only serves about one third of the Mayan speaking population of the area.<ref name=":72"/> Many Maya<ref>{{Cite web |last=Livingston |first=Eric |title=Cities in Mexico and Brief History |url=https://latamliving.com/latam/cities-in-mexico-and-brief-history/#maya-vs-mayan |website=Latam Living}}</ref> children are forced to learn Spanish and cease using their native tongue, which may be challenging for them to do. This in turn causes many of the students to feel that learning at school is not their strong suit and may even end up dropping out early in their education.<ref name=":72" />
