'''Cherkessk''' ({{langx|ru|Черке́сск}}; [[Adyghe language|Adyghe]]: Шэрджэс къалэ; [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]]: Черкес-къалэ) is the [[capital city]] of [[Karachay-Cherkessia]], [[Russia]], as well as its political, economic, and cultural center. Population: {{ru-census2010|129,069|.}} 112,782 (2024).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Rosstat2024 |url=https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/%D0%A1hisl_MO_01-01-2024.xlsx}}</ref>

It was previously known as ''Batalpashinskaya'' (until 1931), ''Batalpashinsk''  (until 1934), ''Sulimov'' (until 1937), ''Yezhovo-Cherkessk'' (until 1939).

==Names==
In Russian, the city is called {{lang|ru|Черке́сск}} (''Čerkessk'')<ref name=KNAB>{{cite web|url=http://www.eki.ee/knab/p_mm_en.htm |title=KNAB, the Place Names Database of EKI |publisher=Eki.ee |access-date=2015-02-20}}</ref> and has similar names in the languages of the city's other major ethnic groups.  In [[Karachay language|Karachay]], it is {{lang|krc|Черкесск}} (''Çerkessk'')<ref name=KNAB/> or {{lang|krc|Черкесск шахар}} (''Çerkessk şahar''); in [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]], it is {{lang|kbd|Шэрджэс къалэ}} (''Şărdjăs qală'') or {{lang|kbd|Черке́сск}} (''Čerkessk'');<ref name=KNAB/> in [[Abaza language|Abaza]], it is {{lang|abq|Черкес къала}} (''Čerkes q̇ala'') or {{lang|abq|Черкесск}} (''Čerkessk'');<ref name=KNAB/> in [[Nogai language|Nogai]], it is {{lang|nog|Шеркеш шахар}} (''Şerkeş şahar'') and in [[Chechen language|Chechen]], it is {{lang|ce|Черкесск}} (''Čerkessk'').

For its first century of existence, Cherkessk was a ''[[stanitsa]]'', a village inside a Cossack host, which from 1825 to 1931 was named '''Batalpashinskaya stanitsa''' (Russian: {{lang|ru|Баталпашинская станица}} ''Batalpašinskaja stanica'')<ref name=KNAB/> and nicknamed '''Pashinka''' ({{lang|ru|Пашинка}} ''Pašinka'')  In 1931, it was renamed '''Batalpashinsk''' ({{lang|ru|Баталпашинск}} ''Batałpašinsk''),<ref name=GR>[http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/city_of_russia/1196/Черкесск Города России: Черкесск. Энциклопедия] — М.: Большая Российская Энциклопедия. И. Кондратьева, 1994. {{in lang|ru}}</ref><ref name=KNAB/> and then in quick succession '''Sulimov''' ({{lang|ru|Сулимов}} ''Sulimov'') in 1934<ref name=GR/><ref name=KNAB/> for [[Daniil Sulimov]], Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Russian SFSR, and following Sulimov's execution in the [[Great Purge]], '''Yezhovo-Cherkessk''' ({{lang|ru|Ежово-Черкесск}} ''Ježovo-Čerkessk'') in 1937<ref name=GR/><ref name=KNAB/> for [[Nikolai Yezhov]], head of the NKVD.  With Yezhov's arrest, the initial "Yezhovo-" was dropped, and the city received its present name in 1939.<ref name=GR/><ref name=KNAB/>

==History==

[[File:Важная выписка из постановления ВЦИК - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Extract from the decree of the All-Russian Central Executive Committee]]

What is now Cherkessk was established in 1804 as a [[Russian Empire|Russian]] military fort on the [[Kuban River]], what was then the border with [[Circassia]], on the spot where in 1790 Russian troops under the command of General [[Johann Hermann von Fersen]] (Ivan Ivanovich Herman fon Fersen) defeated the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Batal Pasha.<ref name=GR/>  In honor of the victory over Batal Pasha, the fort was named Batalpashinskaya; it was a [[redoubt]] surrounded by an earthen rampart and ditch.<ref name=GR/>  (That the fort was named for an enemy leader may have led villagers to prefer the nickname ''Pashinka''.)

[[File:Памятник "Дружба народов" , Черкесск.jpg|thumb|left|Friendship of the People's Monument]]

The settlement itself was founded as the [[Kuban Cossacks|Cossack]] ''[[stanitsa]]'' of Batalpashinskaya near the Russian Army outpost.  The officially recognized year of founding of Batalpashinskaya and modern Cherkessk is 1825.  However, the Cossack settlers from the Khopyour and Kuban regiments began arriving in the newly organized ''stanitsa'' not earlier than spring of 1826.<ref>В. А. Колесников. Былое Невинного Мыса. К 185-летию переселения Хопёрского казачьего полка на Кубань и основания станицы Невиномысской. Ставрополь. «ЮРКИТ» 2011. {{in lang|ru}}</ref> In 1860, the village was designated as the administrative center of the [[Batalpashinsky Otdel]] of the [[Kuban Oblast]].<ref name=GR/>  A decree of 30 December 1869 by [[Alexander II of Russia|Tsar Alexander II]] transformed the village into a city of Batalpashinsk but the decree was never implemented,<ref>Филиппов Е. В. Город Баталпашинск: проекты и реалии. {{in lang|ru}}</ref> and Batalpashinskaya remained a ''stanitsa'' until the Soviet times.  In 1888, the village became a seat of one of Kuban's seven departments.

[[File:Памятник советским воинам, погибшим в годы Великой Отечественной войны площадь Кирова,, Черкесск.jpg|thumb|Monument to the Soviet Soldiers of Cherkessk]]

In 1922, the village became the seat of the [[Karachay-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast]] of the [[RSFSR]],<ref name=GR/> and in 1926, the [[Cherkess National Okrug]].  In 1931, it was granted town status and renamed Batalpashinsk.  It received its current name of Cherkessk in 1939.<ref name=KNAB/>  The city was occupied by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' during [[World War II]] (the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]]) from 11 August 1942 to 17 January 1943<ref name=GR/> as part of the [[Case Blue]] offensive.  In 1957, it became the capital of the reformed Karachay-Cherkess Autonomous Oblast which became the [[Karachay–Cherkess Republic]] in 1991 with the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].
