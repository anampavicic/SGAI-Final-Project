Santiago de los Caballeros has historically been an important strategic city in the [[Dominican War of Independence]]. The city's name, Saint James of the Knights, refers to the [[Hidalgo (nobility)|Hidalgos]] de la Isabela, a group of knights who had come from [[La Isabela]] city to stay in Santiago. Sometimes, the city is called Santiago de los 30 Caballeros (''English: Saint James of the 30 Knights'').

==History==
The name of the city (Saint James of the Knights) refers to the Hidalgos de la Isabela, a group of knights who had come from [[La Isabela]] to settle in Santiago. The colony was originally located in San Francisco de Jacagua (now a suburb of the city), founded in 1495. Still, when an earthquake destroyed it, it was moved to its current location in 1506. In granting in 1508 the Royal Privilege of Concession de Armas to the Villa de Santiago of [[Hispaniola]], the heraldic emblem that was included in his shield was venerated. The royal decree was signed by [[Ferdinand II of Aragon|King Ferdinand]] as administrator of the kingdoms of his daughter [[Joanna I of Castile]].
[[File:Campuzano Polanco Coat of Arms on Burial Slab.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Campuzano Polanco family|Campuzano Polanco Coat of Arms]].]]
The city was devastated by another earthquake on December 2, 1562.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2002 |title=Accounts of Damage from Historical Earthquakes in the Northeastern Caribbean, to Aid in the Determination of their Location and Intensity Magnitudes |url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2011/1133/pdf/ofr2011-1133_212012.pdf |url-status=live |access-date=April 24, 2021 |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior, U.S. Geological Survey |page=15 |archive-date=February 20, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220024931/https://pubs.usgs.gov/of/2011/1133/pdf/ofr2011-1133_212012.pdf }}</ref> The survivors settled on land belonging to Petronila Jáquez of Minaya, adjacent to the [[Yaque del Norte River|Yaque del Norte]], which is the current location of the city's river. The brief French during the [[Peace of Basel]] (which yielded the Spanish part of the island to France in 1795) left its mark on Santiago. Santiago was returned to Spain under the [[Treaty of Paris (1814)|Peace of Paris]] of 1814. During the 19th Century, Santiago began its modern urban planning. European neoclassicism is represented at the Palace Hall, built between 1892 and 1895, by a [[Belgians|Belgian]] architect named Louis Bogaert. The late 1800s saw a peak of architecture in the city. Numerous residences were built in European styles, and make up the central core of Santiago.

==Geography==
[[File:SantiagoCityDominicanRep.JPG|thumb|right|300px|Panoramic view of Santiago.]]
Santiago de los Caballeros is located on a hilly terrain in the middle of the [[Cibao|Cibao Valley]] in the Central Region of the [[Dominican Republic]], one of the most fertile lands found in the island. The [[Yaque del Norte River]] passes by Santiago which is in between the Cordillera Central and the Cordillera Septentrional, two of the three major mountain ranges on the island of [[Hispaniola]], forming the [[Cibao|Cibao Valley]].

===Climate===
Santiago features a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. The average temperature varies little in the city, because the tropical trade winds help mitigate the heat and humidity throughout the year. December and January are the coolest months and July and August are the warmest. Santiago and the rest of the country are in the Caribbean and have a [[tropical climate]], which, when coupled with the city's altitude, 183 meters above sea level, causes cloudy conditions to persist through much of the year. While the entire country is susceptible to [[Atlantic hurricane]]s, Santiago and its environs are more sheltered than other parts of the country from their effects because of its location in the [[Cibao|Cibao Valley]].

The neo-classical gothic Cathedral of Santiago was built in 1895 by Onofre de Lora, an architect native to the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://archivohistorico.santiagodominicana.com/iglesia_catedral_santiago_apos.html |title=Iglesia Catedral Santiago Apostol El Mayor |publisher=Archivohistorico.santiagodominicana.com |access-date=4 November 2011 |archive-date=27 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727131130/http://archivohistorico.santiagodominicana.com/iglesia_catedral_santiago_apos.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
