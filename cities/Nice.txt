The Nice [[urban unit|agglomeration]] extends far beyond the administrative city limits, with a population of nearly one million<ref name=World_Urban_Areas>[http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf Demographia: World Urban Areas] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200207210003/http://www.demographia.com/db-worldua.pdf |date=7 February 2020 }}, Demographia.com, April 2016</ref><ref name=compar/> on an area of {{convert|744|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=compar/> Located on the [[French Riviera]], the southeastern coast of France on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], at the foot of the [[French Alps]], Nice is the second-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast and second-largest city in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]] after [[Marseille]]. Nice is approximately {{convert|13|km|0}} from the [[principality]] of [[Monaco]] and {{convert|30|km}} from the [[France–Italy border|French–Italian border]]. [[Nice Côte d'Azur Airport|Nice's airport]] serves as a gateway to the region.

The city is nicknamed {{lang|fr|Nice la Belle}} ({{lang|oc|[[Nissa La Bella]]}} in Niçard), meaning 'Nice the Beautiful', which is also the title of the unofficial anthem of Nice, written by [[Menica Rondelly]] in 1912. The area of today's Nice contains [[Terra Amata (archaeological site)|Terra Amata]], an archaeological site which displays evidence of a very early use of fire 380,000 years ago. Around 350 BC, Greeks of Marseille founded a permanent settlement and called it ''Nikaia'', after [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]], the goddess of victory.<ref name=":0">{{cite book |editor-last= Ruggiero |editor-first=Alain |title=Nouvelle histoire de Nice |location=Toulouse |publisher=Privat |year=2006 |isbn=978-2-7089-8335-9 |pages=17–18}}</ref> Through the ages, the town has changed hands many times. Its strategic location and port significantly contributed to its maritime strength. From 1388 it was a dominion of [[Duchy of Savoy|Savoy]], then became part of the [[French First Republic]] between 1792 and 1815, when it was returned to the [[Piedmont-Sardinia|Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]], the legal predecessor of the Kingdom of Italy, until its re-annexation by France in 1860.

The natural environment of the Nice area and its mild Mediterranean climate came to the attention of the English upper classes in the second half of the 18th century, when an increasing number of aristocratic families began spending their winters there. In 1931, following its refurbishment, the city's main seaside promenade, the [[Promenade des Anglais]] ("Walkway of the English"), was inaugurated by [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught]]; it owes its name to visitors to the resort.<ref>Alain Ruggiero, op. cit., p. 137</ref> These included [[Queen Victoria]] along with her son [[Edward VII]] who spent winters there, as well as [[Henry Cavendish]], born in Nice, who discovered hydrogen.

The clear air and soft light have particularly appealed to notable painters, such as [[Marc Chagall]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]] and [[Arman]]. Their work is commemorated in many of the city's museums, including [[Musée Marc Chagall]], [[Musée Matisse (Nice)|Musée Matisse]] and [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nice|Musée des Beaux-Arts]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Nice, France travel. Comprehensive guide to Nice|url=http://www.europe-cities.com/en/573/france/nice/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417013429/http://www.europe-cities.com/en/573/france/nice/|archive-date=17 April 2011|access-date=3 April 2011|publisher=Europe-cities.com}}</ref> International writers have also been attracted and inspired by the city. [[Frank Harris]] wrote several books including his autobiography ''[[My Life and Loves]]'' in Nice. [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] spent six consecutive winters in Nice, and wrote ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' there. Additionally, Russian writer [[Anton Chekhov]] completed his play ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' while living in Nice.

Nice's appeal extended to the Russian upper classes. [[Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia|Prince Nicholas Alexandrovich]], heir apparent to [[Imperial Russia]], died in Nice and was a patron of the [[Russian Orthodox Cemetery, Nice]] where [[Catherine Dolgorukov|Princess Catherine Dolgorukova]], [[Morganatic marriage|morganatic]] wife of the [[Tsar]] [[Alexander II of Russia]], is buried. Also buried there are [[Dmitry Shcherbachev|General Dmitry Shcherbachev]] and [[Nikolai Yudenich|General Nikolai Yudenich]], leaders of the anti-Communist [[White movement|White Movement]].

Those interred at the [[Cimetière du Château]] include celebrated jeweler [[Alfred Van Cleef]], [[Emil Jellinek-Mercedes]], founder of the Mercedes car company, film director [[Louis Feuillade]], poet [[Agathe-Sophie Sasserno]], dancer [[Carolina Otero]], ''[[Asterix]]'' comics creator [[René Goscinny]], ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (novel)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' author [[Gaston Leroux]], French prime minister [[Léon Gambetta]], and the first president of the [[International Court of Justice]] [[José Gustavo Guerrero]].

Because of its historical importance as a winter resort town for the European aristocracy and the resulting mix of cultures found in the city, [[UNESCO]] proclaimed Nice a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2021.<ref name="heritage2021">{{cite news|url=https://www.france24.com/en/france/20210727-french-city-of-nice-gains-unesco-world-heritage-status|title=Southern French city of Nice earns UNESCO world heritage status|website=France 24|date=27 July 2021|access-date=30 July 2021}}</ref> The city has the second largest hotel capacity in the country,<ref>[http://www.agglo-nice.fr/chiffres-cles-atouts-territoire.htm Un savoir-faire et un équipement complet en matière d'accueil], [[Urban community of Nice Côte d'Azur]] website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224120503/http://www.agglo-nice.fr/chiffres-cles-atouts-territoire.htm |date=24 February 2009 }}</ref> and it is the second most visited metropolis in [[Metropolitan France]], receiving four million tourists every year.<ref>[http://www.nice.fr/mairie_nice_19918.html Les chiffres clés du tourisme à Nice], site municipal {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217222657/http://www.nice.fr/mairie_nice_19918.html |date=17 December 2007 }}</ref> It also has the third busiest [[Nice Côte d'Azur Airport|airport]] in France, after the two main Parisian ones.<ref name="aeroport">{{cite web |url=http://www.aeroport.fr/fichiers/stats_2007.pdf |title=Union des aéroports français – Résultats d'activité des aéroports français 2007 – Trafic passagers 2007 classement – page 8 |access-date=3 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229142615/http://www.aeroport.fr/fichiers/stats_2007.pdf |archive-date=29 February 2012 }}</ref> It is the historical capital city of the [[County of Nice]] ({{langx|fr|Comté de Nice}}, Niçard: {{lang|oc|Countèa de Nissa}}).<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|wstitle=Nice (France)|display=Nice|volume=19|pages=646–647|inline=1}}</ref>

It was given the name of ''Níkaia'' ({{lang|grc|Νίκαια}}) in honour of a victory over the neighbouring [[Ligures|Ligurians]] (people from the northwest of [[Italy]], probably the Vediantii kingdom); [[Nike (mythology)|Nike]] ({{lang|grc|Νίκη}}) was the [[Greek mythology|Greek goddess]] of victory. The city soon became one of the busiest trading ports on the Ligurian coast; but it had an important rival in the Roman town of [[Cemenelum]], which continued to exist as a separate city until the time of the [[Lombards|Lombard]] invasions.<ref name=EB1911/> The ruins of Cemenelum are in [[Cimiez]], now a district of Nice.

===Early development===

[[File:Nice tour Saint-Francois.jpg|thumb|upright|The Tower of St. François]]
In the 7th century, Nice joined the [[Genoa|Genoese]] League formed by the towns of [[Liguria]]. In 729 the city repulsed the [[Saracens]]; but in 859 and again in 880 the Saracens pillaged and burned it, and for most of the 10th century remained masters of the surrounding country.<ref name=EB1911/>

During the [[Middle Ages]], Nice participated in the wars and [[history of Italy]]. As an ally of [[Pisa]] it was the enemy of [[Genoa]], and both the [[King of France]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Emperor]] endeavoured to subjugate it; but in spite of this it maintained its municipal liberties. During the 13th and 14th centuries the city fell more than once into the hands of the [[Counts of Provence]],<ref name=EB1911/> but it regained its independence even though related to Genoa.

[[File:Italy 1494.svg|thumb|upright|Duchy of Savoy (red) and other independent Italian states in 1494]]

The medieval city walls surrounded the Old Town. The landward side was protected by the River [[Paillon]], which was later covered over and is now the tram route towards the Acropolis. The east side of the town was protected by fortifications on [[Castle of Nice#Castle Hill|Castle Hill]]. Another river flowed into the port on the east side of Castle Hill. Engravings suggest that the port area was also defended by walls. Under [[Monoprix]] in Place de Garibaldi are excavated remains of a well-defended city gate on the main road from [[Turin]].{{citation needed|date=November 2020}}

===Duchy of Savoy===

In 1388, the commune placed itself under the protection of the [[County of Savoy|Counts of Savoy]].<ref name=EB1911/> Nice participated – directly or indirectly – in the history of [[Savoy]] until 1860.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

The maritime strength of Nice now rapidly increased until it was able to cope with the [[Barbary pirates]]; the fortifications were largely extended and the roads to the city improved.<ref name=EB1911/> In 1561 [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy]] abolished the use of Latin as an administrative language and established the [[Italian language]] as the official language of government affairs in Nice.

During the struggle between [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] and [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] great damage was caused by the passage of the armies invading [[Provence]]; [[infectious disease|pestilence]] and famine raged in the city for several years.<ref name=EB1911/> In 1538, in the nearby town of [[Villeneuve-Loubet]], through the mediation of [[Pope Paul III]], the two monarchs concluded a [[Truce of Nice|ten years' truce]].<ref>{{cite web| url=http://villeneuveloubethotelreservation.com/articles/the-chateau-of-villeneuve-loubet| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140426212438/http://villeneuveloubethotelreservation.com/articles/the-chateau-of-villeneuve-loubet| url-status=dead| archive-date=26 April 2014| title=The Chsteau of Villeneuve-Loubet| publisher=Villeneuve-Loubet Guide and Hotels| access-date=30 September 2009}}</ref>

In 1543, Nice was attacked by the united [[Franco-Ottoman alliance|Franco-Ottoman forces]] of Francis I and [[Hayreddin Barbarossa|Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha]], in the [[Siege of Nice]]; though the inhabitants repulsed the assault which followed the terrible bombardment, they were ultimately compelled to surrender, and Barbarossa was allowed to pillage the city and to carry off 2,500 captives. Pestilence appeared again in 1550 and 1580.<ref name=EB1911/>

In 1600, Nice was briefly taken by the [[House of Guise|Duke of Guise]]. By opening the ports of the county to all nations, and proclaiming full freedom of trade (1626), the commerce of the city was given great stimulus, the noble families taking part in its mercantile enterprises.<ref name=EB1911/>

Captured by [[Nicolas Catinat]] in 1691, Nice was restored to [[Savoy]] in 1696; but [[Siege of Nice (1705)|it was again besieged by the French in 1705]], and in the following year its [[citadel]] and [[Defensive wall|rampart]]s were demolished.<ref name=EB1911/>

===Kingdom of Sardinia===
The [[Treaty of Utrecht (1713)]] once more gave the city back to the Duke of Savoy, who was on that same occasion recognised as King of Sicily. In the peaceful years which followed, the "new town" was built. From 1744 until the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)]] the French and Spaniards were again in possession.

In 1775 the king, who in 1718 had swapped his sovereignty of Sicily for the Kingdom of Sardinia, destroyed all that remained of the ancient liberties of the [[Commune in France|commune]]. Conquered in 1792 by the armies of the [[First French Republic]], the County of Nice continued to be part of France until 1814; but after that date it reverted to the [[Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia]].<ref name=EB1911/>

===French annexation===

After the [[Treaty of Turin (1860)|Treaty of Turin]] was signed in 1860 between the [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Sardinian king]] and [[Napoleon III]] as a consequence of the [[Plombières Agreement]], the county was again and definitively ceded to France as a territorial reward for French assistance in the [[Second Italian War of Independence]] against [[Austrian Empire|Austria]], which saw [[Lombardy]] united with [[Piedmont-Sardinia]].  King Victor-Emmanuel II, on 1 April 1860, solemnly asked the population to accept the change of sovereignty, in the name of Italian unity, and the cession was ratified by a regional [[referendum]]. Italophile manifestations and the acclamation of an "Italian Nice" by the crowd are reported on this occasion.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ruggiero |first=Alain |title=Nouvelle Histoire de Nice |year=2006 |language=fr}}</ref> A plebiscite was voted on 15 and 16 April 1860. The opponents of annexation called for abstention, hence the very high abstention rate. The "yes" vote won 83% of registered voters throughout the county of Nice and 86% in Nice, partly thanks to pressure from the authorities.<ref name=":0" /> This is the result of a masterful operation of information control by the French and Piedmontese governments, in order to influence the outcome of the vote in relation to the decisions already taken.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kendall Adams |first=Charles |date=1873 |title=Universal Suffrage under Napoleon III |journal=The North American Review |volume=0117 |pages=360–370}}</ref> The irregularities in the plebiscite voting operations were evident.

The Italian language that was the official language of the County, used by the Church, at the town hall, taught in schools, used in theaters and at the Opera, was immediately abolished and replaced by French.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Large |first=Didier |date=1996 |title=La situation linguistique dans le comté de Nice avant le rattachement à la France |journal=Recherches régionales Côte d'Azur et contrées limitrophes}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Paul Gubbins and Mike Holt |title=Beyond Boundaries: Language and Identity in Contemporary Europe |year=2002 |pages=91–100 |language=En}}</ref> Discontent over annexation to France led to the emigration of a large part of the Italophile population, also accelerated by Italian unification after 1861.

[[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], born in Nice, strongly opposed the cession to France, arguing that the ballot was rigged by the French. Furthermore, for the niçard general his hometown was unquestionably Italian. Politically, the liberals of Nice and the partisans of Garibaldi also appreciated very little Napoleonic authoritarianism. Elements on the right (aristocrats) as on the left (Garibaldians) therefore wanted Nice to return to Italy. Savoy was also transferred to the French crown by similar means.

In 1871, during the first free elections in the County, the pro-Italian lists obtained almost all the votes in the legislative elections (26,534 votes out of 29,428 votes cast), and Garibaldi was elected deputy at the [[National Assembly (France)|National Assembly]]. Pro-Italians took to the streets cheering ''"Viva Nizza! Viva Garibaldi!".'' The French government sent 10,000 soldiers to Nice, closed the Italian newspaper ''Il Diritto di Nizza'' and imprisoned several demonstrators. The population of Nice rose up from 8 to 10 February and the three days of demonstration took the name of "[[Niçard Vespers]]". The revolt was suppressed by French troops. On 13 February, Garibaldi was not allowed to speak at the French parliament meeting in Bordeaux to ask for the reunification of Nice to the [[Kingdom of Italy|newborn Italian unitary state]], and he resigned from his post as deputy.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Courrière |first=Henri |date=2007 |title=Les troubles de février 1871 à Nice |journal=Cahiers de la Méditerranée|issue=74 |pages=179–208 |doi=10.4000/cdlm.2693 |url=https://journals.openedition.org/cdlm/2693 }}</ref> The failure of Vespers led to the expulsion of the last pro-Italian intellectuals from Nice, such as Luciano Mereu or Giuseppe Bres, who were expelled or deported.

The pro-Italian irredentist movement persisted throughout the period 1860–1914, despite the repression carried out since the annexation. The French government implemented a policy of [[Francization]] of society, language and culture.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Paul Gubbins and Mine Holt |title=Beyond Boundaries: Language and Identity in Contemporary Europe |year=2002 |pages=91–100}}</ref> The toponyms of the communes of the ancient County have been francized, with the obligation to use French in Nice,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aiig.altervista.org/Nizzardo/IL%20NIZZARDO%20NEI%20SUOI%20ASPETTI%20GEOGRAFICI.pdf|title=Il Nizzardo|access-date=17 May 2021|language=it}}</ref> as well as certain surnames (for example the Italian surname "Bianchi" was francized into "Leblanc", and the Italian surname "Del Ponte" was francized into "Dupont").<ref name="limesonline">{{cite web|url=https://www.limesonline.com/unitalia-sconfinata/2845|title=Un'Italia sconfinata|date=20 February 2009 |access-date=17 May 2021|language=it}}</ref>

Italian-language newspapers in Nice were banned. In 1861, ''La Voce di Nizza'' was closed (temporarily reopened during the Niçard Vespers), followed by ''Il Diritto di Nizza'', closed in 1871.<ref name=":1" /> In 1895 it was the turn of ''Il Pensiero di Nizza'', accused of irredentism. Many journalists and writers from Nice wrote in these newspapers in Italian. Among these are Enrico Sappia, Giuseppe André, Giuseppe Bres, Eugenio Cais di Pierlas and others.

In 1900, the [[Trams in Nice|Tramway de Nice]] electrified its horse-drawn streetcars and spread its network to the entire ''département'' from [[Menton]] to [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]]. By the 1930s more bus connections were added in the area.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} In the 1930s, Nice hosted international car racing in the [[Formula Libre]] (predecessor to [[Formula One]]) on the so-called Circuit Nice. The circuit started along the waterfront just south of the Jardin Albert I, then headed westward along the [[Promenade des Anglais]] followed by a hairpin turn at the [[Hotel Negresco]] to come back eastward and around the Jardin Albert I before heading again east along the beach on the Quai des Etats-Unis.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.bestofniceblog.com/history-nice-france/nice-grand-prix/|title=Nice Grand Prix|newspaper=Best of Nice |access-date=25 September 2019|archive-date=25 September 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190925172454/http://www.bestofniceblog.com/history-nice-france/nice-grand-prix/|url-status=live}}</ref>

As war broke out in September 1939, Nice became a city of refuge for many displaced foreigners, notably Jews fleeing the Nazi progression into Eastern Europe. From Nice many sought further shelter in the [[French colonial empire|French colonies]], Morocco and North and South America. After July 1940 and the establishment of the [[Vichy France|Vichy Regime]], [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] aggressions accelerated the exodus, starting in July 1941 and continuing through 1942. On 26 August 1942, 655 Jews of foreign origin were rounded up by the Laval government and interned in the Auvare barracks. Of these, 560 were deported to [[Drancy internment camp]] on 31 August 1942. Due to the activity of the Jewish banker [[Angelo Donati]] and of the Capuchin friar [[Père Marie-Benoît]] the local authorities hindered the application of anti-Jewish Vichy laws.<ref>Léon Poliakov, ''La conditions des Juifs sous l'occupation italienne'', Paris, CDJC, 1946 and bibliographies of [[Angelo Donati]] and [[Père Marie-Benoît]]</ref>

The first [[French Resistance|''résistants'']] to the new regime were a group of high school seniors of the Lycée de Nice, now {{ill|Lycée Masséna|fr}}, in September 1940, later arrested and executed in 1944 near [[Verdon Gorge|Castellane]].{{citation needed|date=October 2023}} The first public demonstrations occurred on 14 July 1942 when several hundred protesters took to the streets along the Avenue de la Victoire and in the Place Masséna.{{citation needed|date=October 2023}} In November 1942 German troops moved into most of unoccupied France, but Italian troops moved into a smaller zone including Nice.{{citation needed|date=October 2023}} A certain ambivalence remained among the population, many of whom were recent immigrants of Italian ancestry. However, the resistance gained momentum after the Italian surrender in 1943 when the German army occupied the former Italian zone.{{citation needed|date=October 2023}} Reprisals intensified between December 1943 and July 1944, when many partisans were tortured and executed by the local [[Gestapo]].{{citation needed|date=October 2023}} American paratroopers entered the city on 30 August 1944 and Nice was finally liberated.{{citation needed|date=October 2024}} The consequences of the war were heavy: the population decreased by 15% {{citation needed|date=November 2017}} and economic life was totally disrupted.

In the second half of the 20th century, Nice enjoyed an economic boom primarily driven by tourism and construction. Two men dominated this period: [[Jean Médecin]], [[Mayor (France)|mayor]] for 33 years from 1928 to 1943 and from 1947 to 1965, and his son [[Jacques Médecin|Jacques]], mayor for 24 years from 1966 to 1990. Under their leadership, there was extensive urban renewal, including many new constructions. These included the convention centre, theatres, new thoroughfares and expressways. The arrival of the [[Pied-Noir|Pieds-Noirs]], refugees from Algeria after 1962 independence, also gave the city a boost and somewhat changed the make-up of its population and traditional views.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}} By the late 1980s, rumors of political corruption in the city government surfaced; and eventually formal accusations against Jacques Médecin forced him to flee France in 1990. Later arrested in [[Uruguay]] in 1993, he was extradited back to France in 1994, convicted of several counts of corruption and associated crimes and sentenced to imprisonment.

On 16 October 1979, a [[landslide]] and an undersea slide caused two [[tsunami]]s that hit the western coast of Nice; these [[1979 Nice events|events]] killed between 8 and 23 people.

===21st century===
In February 2001, European leaders met in Nice to negotiate and sign what is now the [[Treaty of Nice]], amending the institutions of the European Union.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/irish-referendum-on-nice-treaty-doomed-to-fail-again-189539.html|title=Irish referendum on Nice Treaty 'doomed to fail again'|work=[[The Independent]]|date=23 May 2002|first=Shawn|last=Pogatchnik|access-date=17 March 2020|archive-date=12 May 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200512163639/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/irish-referendum-on-nice-treaty-doomed-to-fail-again-189539.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2003, local Chief [[Prosecutor]] [[Éric de Montgolfier]] alleged that some judicial cases involving local personalities had been suspiciously derailed by the local judiciary, which he suspected of having unhealthy contacts through [[Freemasonry|Masonic]] lodges with the defendants. A controversial official report stated later that Montgolfier had made unwarranted accusations.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[File:CollineDuChateau NiceFrance2022.png|thumb|A sunset over the ''Promenade des Anglais.'']]
The [[Promenade des Anglais]] ("Promenade of the English") is a promenade along the [[Baie des Anges]] ("Bay of the Angels"), which is a bay of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] in Nice. Before Nice was urbanised, the coastline at Nice was just bordered by a deserted stretch of [[shingle beach]] (covered with large pebbles). The first houses were located on higher ground well away from the sea, as wealthy tourists visiting Nice in the 18th century did not come for the beach, but for the gentle winter weather.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} The areas close to the water were home to Nice's dockworkers and fishermen.

In the second half of the 18th century, many wealthy English people took to spending the winter in Nice, enjoying the panorama along the coast. This early aristocratic English colony conceived the building of a promenade with the leadership and financial support of [[Lewis Way|Rev. Lewis Way]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Nash |first1=Dennison |title=The rise and fall of an aristocratic tourist culture: Nice: 1763–1936 |journal=Annals of Tourism Research |date=1979 |volume=6 |issue=1 |page=65 |doi=10.1016/0160-7383(79)90095-1}}</ref> With the initial promenade completed, the city of Nice, intrigued by the prospect, greatly increased the scope of the work. The Promenade was first called the ''Camin dei Anglès'' (the English Way) by the Niçois in their native dialect [[Niçard|Nissart]]. In 1823, the promenade was named ''La Promenade des Anglais'' by the French, a name that would stick after the annexation of Nice by France in 1860.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Mitchell |first1=L.G. |title=Voyages au pays des mangeurs de grenouilles: La France vue par les Britanniques du XVII siecle a nos jours |journal=The English Historical Review |date=1994 |volume=109 |issue=433 |page=1018 |doi=10.1093/ehr/CXI.433.1018 |url=https://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA16408900&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=00138266&p=LitRC&sw=w |access-date=4 October 2020 |archive-date=31 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210131211240/https://go.gale.com/ps/anonymous?id=GALE%7CA16408900&sid=googleScholar&v=2.1&it=r&linkaccess=abs&issn=00138266&p=LitRC&sw=w |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Hotel Negresco]] on the Promenade des Anglais was named after [[Henri Negresco]] who had the palatial hotel constructed in 1912. In keeping with the conventions of the time, when the Negresco first opened in 1913 its front opened on the side opposite the Mediterranean.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Another place worth mentioning is the small street parallel to the Promenade des Anglais, leading from Nice's downtown, beginning at Place Masséna and running parallel to the promenade in the direction of the airport for a short distance of about four blocks. This section of the city is referred to as the "Zone Piétonne", or "Pedestrian Zone". Cars are not allowed (with exception to delivery trucks), making this avenue a popular walkway.

Old Nice is also home to the [[Opéra de Nice]]. It was constructed at the end of the 19th century under the design of François Aune, to replace King Charles Félix's Maccarani Theater. Today, it is open to the public and provides a regular program of performances.

===Squares===

====Place Masséna====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}

The ''Place Masséna'' is the main square of the city. Before the [[Paillon]] River was covered over, the Pont-Neuf was the only practicable way between the old town and the modern one. The square was thus divided into two parts (North and South) in 1824. With the demolition of the Masséna Casino in 1979, the Place Masséna became more spacious and less dense and is now bordered by red ochre buildings of [[Italian architecture]].

The recent rebuilding of the tramline gave the square back to the pedestrians, restoring its status as a real Mediterranean square. It is lined with palm trees and stone pines, instead of being the rectangular roundabout of sorts it had become over the years. Since its construction, the Place Masséna has always been the spot for great public events. It is used for concerts, and particularly during the summer festivals, the ''[[Nice Carnival|Corso carnavalesque]]'' (carnival parade) in February, the military procession of 14 July (Bastille Day) or other traditional celebrations and banquets.

The Place Masséna is a two-minute walk from the [[Promenade des Anglais]], old town, town centre, and Albert I Garden (''Jardin Albert Ier''). It is also a large crossroads between several of the main streets of the city: [[avenue Jean Médecin]], ''avenue Félix Faure'', ''boulevard Jean Jaurès'', ''avenue de Verdun'' and ''rue Gioffredo''.

====Place Garibaldi====
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Nice Place Garibaldi 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Garibaldi's monument, Place Garibaldi]]

The ''Place Garibaldi'' also stands out for its architecture and history. It is named after [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]], hero of the [[Italian unification]] (born in Nice in 1807 when Nice was part of the Napoleonic Empire, before reverting to the Kingdom of Piedmont-Sardinia). The square was built at the end of the 18th century and served as the entry gate to the city and end of the road from Turin. It took several names between 1780 and 1870 (Plaça Pairoulièra, Place de la République, Place Napoléon, Place d'Armes, Place Saint-Augustin, Piazza Vittorio) and finally Place Garibaldi in September 1870.

A statue of Garibaldi, who was fiercely in favour of the union of Nice with Italy, stands in the centre of the square. The recent rebuilding of the area to accommodate the new tramway line gave mostly the entire square to pedestrians. The architecture is in line with the Turin model, which was the norm of urban renewal throughout the entire realm of the House of Savoy.
[[File:Nice tramway place Garibaldi.jpg|thumb|left|Place Garibaldi, pedestrian since the introduction of the Nice tramway]]

It is a crossroads between the ''Vieux Nice'' (old town) and the town centre. Place Garibaldi is close to the eastern districts of Nice, ''Port Lympia'' (Lympia Harbour), and the TNL commercial centre. This square is also a junction of several important streets: the ''boulevard Jean-Jaurès'', the ''avenue de la République'', the ''rue Cassini'' and the ''rue Catherine-Ségurane''.

====Place Rossetti====
Entirely enclosed and pedestrianised, this square is located in the heart of the old town. With typical buildings in red and yellow ochres surrounding the square, the ''cathédrale Sainte-Réparate'' and the fountain in the centre, ''place Rossetti'' is a must-see spot in the old town. By day, the place is invaded by the terraces of traditional restaurants and the finest ice-cream makers. By night, the environment changes radically, with tourists and youths flocking to the square, where music reverberates on the walls of the small square. The square's lighting at night gives it a magical aspect.

Place Rossetti is in the centre of the old town, streets ''Jesus'', ''Rossetti'', ''Mascoïnat'' and the ''Pont-vieux'' (old bridge).

====Cours Saleya====
[[File:Saleya nice.jpg|thumb|Saleya Course (2007)]]

The Cours Saleya is situated parallel to the ''Quai des États-Unis''. In the past, it belonged to the upper classes. It is probably the most traditional square of the town, with its daily flower market. The ''Cours Saleya'' also opens on the ''Palais des Rois Sardes'' (Palace of the Kings of Sardinia). In the present, the ''court'' is mostly a place of entertainment.

====Place du Palais====
[[File:NIKAIA-palaisN5.jpg|thumb|Place du Palais view of the Rusca palace]]

As its name indicates, the ''Place du Palais'' is where the ''Palais de la Justice'' (Law courts) of Nice is located. On this square, there also is the ''Palais Rusca'', which also belongs to the justice department (home of the ''tribunal de grande instance'').

The square is also notable due to the presence of the city clock. Today, the ''Place du Palais'' is alive day and night. Often, groups of youths will hang out on the steps leading to the ''Palais de la Justice''. Concerts, films, and other major public events frequently occur in this space.

It is situated halfway between the ''Cours Saleya'' and ''Place Masséna''.

==Administration==

[[File:Nice, France 2016-473.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Hôtel de Ville, Nice|Hôtel de Ville]]]]
Located in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] [[Regions of France|region]], Nice is a [[Communes of France|commune]] and the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] (administrative capital) of the [[Alpes-Maritimes]] département. However, it is also the largest city in France that is not a regional capital; the much larger [[Marseille]] is its regional capital. [[Christian Estrosi]], its mayor, is a member of [[Horizons (political party)|Horizons]] (formerly a member of [[The Republicans (France)|The Republicans]]). He has been incumbent since 2017. The city council is based at the [[Hôtel de Ville, Nice|Hôtel de Ville]].<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.pss-archi.eu/immeubles/FR-06088-40634.html |title= Hôtel de Ville de Nice|publisher=PSS Architecture|access-date=15 October 2024}}</ref>

The city is divided into nine [[cantons of France|cantons]]: [[Canton of Nice-1|Nice-1]], [[Canton of Nice-2|2]], [[Canton of Nice-3|3]], [[Canton of Nice-4|4]], [[Canton of Nice-5|5]], [[Canton of Nice-6|6]], [[Canton of Nice-7|7]], [[Canton of Nice-8|8]] and [[Canton of Nice-9|9]].

===Coat of arms===
[[File:Bandièra_de_Niça.svg|thumb|upright|Banner of arms of the city of Nice]]

The coat of arms of Nice appeared for the first time in a copy of the ''Regulations'' of [[Amadeus VIII of Savoy|Amadeus VIII]], probably written around 1430.<ref name="schor_22_23">Ralph Schor (Edited by), ''Dictionnaire historique et biographique du comté de Nice'' (''Historical and biographical dictionary of the County of Nice''), Nice, Serre, 2002, {{ISBN|978-2-86410-366-0}}, pp.22–23 {{in lang|fr}}</ref> The Nice is symbolised by a red eagle on silver background, placed on three mountains, which can be described in French [[heraldic]] language as "d'argent à une aigle de gueule posée sur trois coupeaux".<ref name="schor_22_23"/> ("Upon silver a red eagle is displayed, posed upon three mounds.") The arms have only undergone minor changes: the eagle has become more and more stylised, it now "wears" a coronet for the [[County of Nice]], and the three mountains are now surrounded by a stylised sea.<ref name="schor_22_23"/>

The presence of the eagle, an imperial emblem, shows that these arms are related to the power of the [[House of Savoy]]. The eagle standing over the three hills is a depiction of Savoy, referring to its domination over the country around Nice.<ref name="schor_22_23"/> The combination of silver and red (argent and gules) is a reference to the colours of the [[Savoy|flag of Savoy]].<ref name="schor_22_23"/> The three mountains symbolise a territorial honour, without concern for geographic realism.<ref name="schor_22_23"/>

==Geography==
[[File:Nice SPOT 1161.jpg|thumb|Nice seen from Spot Satellite]]

Nice consists of two large bays. [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]] sits on an enclosed bay, while the main expanse of the city lies between the old port city and the Aeroport de Côte d'Azur, across a gently curving bay. The city rises from the flat beach into gentle rising hills, then is bounded by surrounding mountains that represent the Southern and nearly the Western extent of the [[Ligurian Alps]] range.

===Flora===
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
The natural vegetation of Nice is typical for a Mediterranean landscape, with a heavy representation of broadleaf evergreen shrubs. Trees tend to be scattered but form dense forests in some areas. Large native tree species include evergreens such as [[Quercus ilex|holm oak]], [[stone pine]] and [[arbutus]]. Many introduced species grow in parks and gardens. [[Palm tree|Palm]]s, [[eucalyptus]] and [[citrus fruit]]s are among the trees which give Nice a subtropical appearance. But there are also species familiar to temperate areas around the world; examples include [[Horse-chestnut (tree)|horse chestnut]], [[Tilia|linden]] and even [[Norway spruce]].

===Climate===
Nice has a [[hot-summer Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa''), enjoying mild winters with moderate rainfall. It is one of the warmest Mediterranean climates for its latitude. Summers are warm to hot, dry, and sunny. Rainfall is rare in this season, and a typical July month only records one or two days with measurable rainfall. The temperature is typically above {{convert|26|°C|0|abbr=on}} but rarely above {{convert|32|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The climate data is recorded from the airport, located just metres from the sea. Summer temperatures, therefore, are often higher in the city. The average maximum temperature in the warmest months of July and August is about {{convert|27|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|37.7|°C|1|abbr=on}} on 1 August 2006. Autumn generally starts sunny in September and becomes more cloudy and rainy towards October, while temperatures usually remain above {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} until November where days start to cool down to around {{convert|17|°C|0|abbr=on}}.

Winters are characterised by mild days ({{convert|11|to|17|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}), cool nights ({{convert|4|to|9|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}), and variable weather. Days can be either sunny and dry or damp and rainy. The average minimum temperature in January is around {{convert|5|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Frost is unusual and snowfalls are rare. The most recent snowfall in Nice was on 26 February 2018.<ref>"[https://www.thelocal.fr/20180226/in-pictures-french-riviera-in-the-snow French Riviera hit by snowfall] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812150347/https://www.thelocal.fr/20180226/in-pictures-french-riviera-in-the-snow |date=12 August 2018 }}". ''The Local fr''. The Local Europe AB. 26 February 2018.</ref> Nice also received a dusting of snow in 2005, 2009 and 2010. Spring starts cool and rainy in late March, and Nice becomes increasingly warm and sunny around June.

==Economy and tourism==
Nice is the seat of the [[Chambre de commerce et d'industrie Nice Côte d'Azur]], which manages the Port of Nice. Investors from France and abroad can benefit from the assistance of the Côte d'Azur Economic Development Agency [[Team Côte d'Azur]].

Nice has one conference centre: the [[Palais des Congrès Acropolis]]. The city also has several business parks, including [[Districts of businesses Niçoise L' Arenas|l'Arenas]], [[Districts of Niçoise Nice businesses Plaine|Nice the Plain]], [[Districts of businesses Niçoise Nice Méridia|Nice Méridia]], [[Districts of businesses Niçoise Saint Isidore|Saint Isidore]], and the Northern Forum.

In addition, the city features several shopping centres such as Nicetoile on Avenue Jean Médecin, Cap3000 in [[Saint-Laurent-du-Var]] (the 5th-biggest mall in France by surface area), Nice TNL, Nice Lingostière, Northern Forum, St-Isidore, the Trinity (around the [[Auchan]] [[hypermarket]]) and [[Polygone Riviera]] in [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].

[[Sophia Antipolis]] is a technology park northwest of [[Antibes]]. Much of the park is within the commune of [[Valbonne]]. Established between 1970 and 1984, it primarily houses companies in the fields of computing, electronics, pharmacology and biotechnology. Several institutions of higher learning are also located here, along with the European headquarters of W3C. It is known as "Europe's first science and technology hub" and is valued at more than 5 billion euros.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Technology Parks to promote regional economic transformation {{!}} Interreg Europe – Sharing solutions for better policy |url=https://www.interregeurope.eu/find-policy-solutions/stories/technology-parks-to-promote-regional-economic-transformation |access-date=8 February 2023 |website=www.interregeurope.eu |language=en}}</ref>

The [[Nice metropolitan area]] had a [[List of cities by GDP|GDP amounting to $47.7 billion]], and $34,480 per capita,<ref name="Brookings">{{cite web|url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|title=Global city GDP 2011|publisher=Brookings Institution|access-date=4 March 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605135349/http://www.brookings.edu/research/interactives/global-metro-monitor-3|archive-date=5 June 2013}}</ref> slightly lower than the French average.

==Infrastructure==
===Transport===
====Port====
[[File:Hafen von Nizza.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Port of Nice]]
The main port of Nice is also known as Lympia port. This name comes from the Lympia spring which fed a small lake in a marshy zone where work on the port was started in 1745.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Today this is the principal harbour installation of Nice – there is also a small port in the Carras district. The port is the first port cement manufacturer in France, linked to the treatment plants of the rollers of the valley of Paillon. Fishing activities remain but the number of professional fishermen is now less than 10.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} Nice, being the point of continental France nearest to [[Corsica]], has ferry connections with the island developed with the arrival of NGV (''navires à grande vitesse'') or [[high-speed craft]]. The connections are provided by [[Corsica Ferries - Sardinia Ferries]]. Located in front of the port, the Place Cassini has been renamed Place of Corsica.

====Airport====

[[Nice Côte d'Azur Airport]] is the third busiest airport in France after [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] and [[Orly Airport]], both near Paris. It is on the [[Promenade des Anglais]], near l'Arénas and has two [[Airport terminal|terminals]]. Due to its proximity to the Principality of [[Monaco]], it also serves as that city–state's airport. A helicopter service provided by [[Heli Air Monaco]] and [[Monacair]] links the city and airport. It is run by the ACA (Aéroports Côte d'Azur), which includes [[Cannes - Mandelieu Airport]] and [[La Môle – Saint-Tropez Airport]]. Public transportation into the city proper is serviced by the [[Nice tramway|Tramway]] line 2 (T2).

====Rail====

The main railway station is [[Gare de Nice-Ville|Nice-Ville]], served both by high-speed [[TGV]] trains connecting Paris and Nice in less than 6 hours and by local commuter [[TER Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur|TER]] services. [[Gare de Marseille-Saint-Charles|Marseille]] is reached in 2.5 hours. Nice also has international connections to Italy, Switzerland, Belgium, and Russia.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11400917|title=French Riviera train for Russia|work=BBC News|date=23 September 2010|access-date=24 September 2010|archive-date=24 September 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100924045744/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11400917|url-status=live}}</ref> Nice is also served by several suburban stations including [[Gare de Nice-Saint-Augustin|Nice St-Augustin]], Nice St-Roch, Nice Pont-Michel and [[Gare de Nice-Riquier|Nice Riquier]].

Nice is also the southern terminus of the independently run [[Chemins de Fer de Provence]] railway line which connects the city with [[Digne]] in approximately 4 hours from the [[Nice CP station]]. A metro-like suburban service is also provided on the southern part of the line.

====Tram====
[[Trams in Nice|Tramway de Nice]] began operating horse-drawn trams in 1879. Electrified in 1900, the combined length of the network reached {{convert|144|km|mi|frac=2|abbr=on}} by 1930. The replacement of trams with [[trolleybus]]es began in 1948 and was completed in 1953.

In 2007, the [[Nice tramway|new Tramway de Nice]] linked the northern and eastern suburbs via the city centre. Two other lines are currently operating. The second line runs east–west from [[Avenue Jean Médecin|Jean Médecin]] to the [[Nice Côte d'Azur Airport]] and reaches the Port, while the third line provides a connection to the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin and to Lingostière railway station.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |title=Dates et chiffres clés / La ligne 1 / Accueil – Tramway de la Communauté Urbaine Nice Côte d'Azur |language=fr |publisher=Tramway.nice.fr |access-date=15 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110906064924/http://tramway.nice.fr/La-ligne-1/Dates-et-chiffres-cles |archive-date=6 September 2011 }}</ref> A fourth line is set to run from the future TGV Nice Saint-Augustin to [[Cagnes-sur-Mer]].

{{as of|2018}}, the urban area (''[[unité urbaine]]'') of Nice, defined by INSEE, is home to 944,321 inhabitants (seventh most populous in France) and its [[Nice metropolitan area|metropolitan area]] (''[[functional area (France)|aire urbaine]]'') totals 609,695 inhabitants, which makes it the 13th largest in France.<ref name=compar>[https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/1405599?geo=AAV2020-017+UU2020-06701+COM-06088 Comparateur de territoire: Aire d'attraction des villes 2020 de Nice (017), Unité urbaine 2020 de Nice (06701), Commune de Nice (06088)], [[Institut national de la statistique et des études économiques|INSEE]], retrieved 20 June 2022.</ref> Part of the urban area of Nice belongs to the metropolitan area of Cannes–Antibes.

Since the 1970s, the number of inhabitants has not changed significantly; the relatively high migration to Nice is balanced by a natural negative growth of the population.

==Observatory==
[[File:Coupole Bischoffsheim.jpg|thumb|View of the Bischoffsheim cupola, the main cupola of [[Nice Observatory]]]]
The ''Observatoire de Nice'' ([[Nice Observatory]]) is located on the summit of Mont Gros. The observatory was established in 1879 by the banker [[Raphaël Bischoffsheim]]. The architect was [[Charles Garnier (architect)|Charles Garnier]]; [[Gustave Eiffel]] designed the main dome.

The 76-cm (30-inch) [[refractor telescope]] that became operational in 1888 was at that time the world's largest telescope.

==Culture==
Terra-Amata, an archaeological site dating from the [[Lower Palaeolithic]] age, is situated near Nice. Nice itself was established by the ancient [[Greeks]]. There was also an independent [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] city, Cemenelum, near Nice, where the hill of Cimiez is located.

Since the 2nd century AD, the light of the city has attracted painters and sculptors such as [[Chagall]], [[Matisse]], [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], [[Yves Klein|Klein]], [[Arman]] and [[Sacha Sosno|Sosno]]. Nice inspired many composers and intellectuals in different countries e.g. [[Hector Berlioz|Berlioz]], [[Rossini]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], etc.

Nice also has numerous museums of all kinds: [[Musée Marc Chagall]], [[Musée Matisse (Nice)|Musée Matisse]], [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Nice|Musée des Beaux-Arts]], [[Musée international d'Art naïf Anatole Jakovsky]], Musée Terra-Amata, Museum of Asian Art, [[Musée d'art moderne et d'art contemporain]] (which devotes much space to the well-known ''École of Nice ''"), Museum of Natural History, Musée Masséna, Naval Museum and ''Galerie des Ponchettes''.

Being a vacation resort, Nice hosts many festivals throughout the year, such as the [[Nice Carnival]] and the [[Nice Jazz Festival]].

Nice has a distinct culture due to its unique history. The local language ''[[Niçard]] (Nissart)'' is an [[Occitan language|Occitan]] dialect (but some Italian scholars argue that it is a [[Ligurian language (Romance)|Ligurian]] dialect).{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} It is still spoken by a substantial minority.{{Citation needed|date=October 2019}} Strong [[Italian culture|Italian]] and (to a lesser extent) [[Corsica]]n influences make it more intelligible to speakers of Italian than other extant Provençal dialects.{{citation needed|date=February 2023}}

In the past, Nice has welcomed many immigrants from [[Italy]] (who continue to make up a large proportion of the population), as well as [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] immigrants. However, in the past few decades immigration has been opened to include immigrants from all over the world, particularly those from former [[North Africa|Northern]] and [[West Africa|Western African]] colonies, as well as [[Southeast Asia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} Traditions are still alive, especially in [[folk music]] and dances, including the [[farandole]] – an open-chain community dance.

Since 1860 a cannon (based at the Château east of Old Nice) is shot at twelve o'clock sharp. The detonation can be heard almost all over the city. This tradition goes back to Sir Thomas Coventry, who intended to remind the citizens of having lunch on time.<ref>[https://archive.today/20130411000725/http://www.francemonthly.com/nice-french-riviera/ Nice – French Riviera: Noon on the Dot] from ''francemonthly.com''. Retrieved 11 February 2013.</ref>

===Cuisine===
The cuisine of Nice is especially close to those of [[Provençal cuisine|Provence]] but also [[Ligurian cuisine|Liguria]] and [[Piemontese cuisine|Piedmont]] and uses local ingredients ([[olive oil]], [[anchovies]], fruit and vegetables) but also those from more remote regions, in particular from Northern Europe, because ships which came to pick up olive oil arrived full of food products, such as dried [[haddock]].{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

The local cuisine is rich in around 200 recipes. Most famous include the local tart made with onions and [[anchovies]] (or anchovy paste), named "[[Pissaladière]]" and derived from the ligurian pissalandrea, a sort of pizza. ''[[Farinata|Socca]]'' is a type of pancake made from [[chickpea]] flour. ''[[Farcis niçois]]'' is a dish made from vegetables stuffed with a mixture of breadcrumbs, meat (generally sausage and ground beef), and herbs; and ''[[salade niçoise]]'' is a tomato salad with baked eggs, tuna or anchovies, olives and often lettuce. Green peppers, vinaigrette, and other raw green vegetables may be included. Potatoes and green beans are not traditional components.

Local meat comes from neighbouring valleys, such as the sheep of [[Sisteron]]. Local fish, such as mullets, bream, sea urchins, anchovies and poutine/[[gianchetti]] are used to a great extent, so much so that it has given birth to a proverb: "fish are born in the sea and die in oil".<ref>{{Cite book|title=What Caesar Did For My Salad: The Secret Meanings of our Favourite Dishes|last=Jack|first=Albert|publisher=Penguin UK|year=2010|isbn=9780141929927|location=London}}</ref>
