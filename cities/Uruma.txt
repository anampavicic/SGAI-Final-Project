{{nihongo|'''Uruma'''|うるま市|Uruma-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Okinawa Prefecture]], [[Japan]].<ref name="d"/> The modern city of Uruma was established on April 1, 2005, when the cities of [[Gushikawa, Okinawa|Gushikawa]] and [[Ishikawa, Okinawa|Ishikawa]] were merged with the towns of [[Katsuren, Okinawa|Katsuren]] and [[Yonashiro, Okinawa|Yonashiro]] (both from [[Nakagami District, Okinawa|Nakagami District]]).<ref name="d"/><ref name="n"/> As of 1 October 2020, the city has an estimated [[population]] of 125,303 and a [[population density]] of 1,500 people per km<sup>2</sup>. The total area is 86.00&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. The city covers part of the east coast of the south of [[Okinawa Island]], the [[Katsuren Peninsula]], and the eight [[Yokatsu Islands]].<ref name="yokatsu"/> The Yokatsu Islands include numerous sites important to the [[Ryukyuan religion]], and the city as a whole has numerous historical sites, including: [[Katsuren Castle]], [[Agena Castle]], and [[Iha Castle]] and the [[Iha Shell Mound]].<ref name="d"/><ref name="n"/> It is home to the largest venue for [[Tōgyū|Okinawan bullfighting]]. The [[Mid-Sea Road]], which crosses the ocean and connects the Yokatsu Islands to the main island of Okinawa, is now a symbol of Uruma.<ref name="d"/><ref name="n"/><ref name="kaichu"/>

Uruma is noted for its role in hosting large-scale refugee camps and the initial organization of local government of Okinawa  immediately after the [[Battle of Okinawa]] in 1945. As such the city is considered the home of the starting point of the restoration of civil life in Okinawa immediately after the end of [[World War II]].<ref name="ishikawa" /><ref name="uruma-e" /> United States maintains four military bases in Uruma, some of which span other municipalities in Okinawa: Kadena Ammunition Storage Area, [[Camp McTureous]], [[Camp Courtney]], and White Beach Naval Facility. The bases cover 12.97% of the total area of the city. Two controversies have surrounded American military bases in Uruma: the [[1959 Okinawa F-100 crash]] which killed and injured numerous students and residents, and the transport of [[Agent Orange]] via the White Beach Naval Facility for testing in Okinawa in the early 1960s as part of the classified Project AGILE.<ref name="orange" /><ref name="orange-2" /><ref name="orange-3" />

==Etymology==
In the [[Japanese language]] the name of the city is written using the [[hiragana]] syllabary instead of [[kanji]] characters because, according to the city, it looks endearing and soft.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.city.uruma.lg.jp/3/2764.html |title=''Uruma no meishō sentei riyū ni tsuite'' (うるまの名称選定理由について) |publisher=Uruma City Official Web Site |language=ja |access-date=7 April 2015 }}</ref> The name of the city of Uruma comes from a poetic name for Okinawa Island. A folk etymology, which was adopted by the city itself,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.city.uruma.lg.jp/2/1383.html |title=''Uruma-shi no imi'' (うるま市の意味) |publisher=Uruma City Official Web Site |language=ja |access-date=11 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314232141/http://www.city.uruma.lg.jp/2/1383.html |archive-date=14 March 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> segments ''uruma'' into ''uru'' (fine sand or [[coral]] in [[Okinawan language|Okinawan]]) and ''*ma'' (island?). Another theory{{whose|date=September 2024}} relates it to ''urumaa'', meaning [[Cricket (insect)|cricket]] in Okinawan.

The Okinawan origin of the word, however, has long been questioned. In fact, it was in mainland Japan that the word was first attested and eventually came to refer to Okinawa. The first known reference to ''uruma'' is a [[Waka (poetry)|waka]] poem by [[Fujiwara no Kintō]] in the early 11th century. He compared a woman's coldheartedness to the incomprehensible speech of drifters from ''Ureung'' Island (迂陵島, identified as [[Ulleungdo|Ulleung Island]]) of [[Goryeo|Goryeo Kingdom]], which Kintō called Silla, a practice rather common in [[Heian period|Heian-period]] Japan. However, the association with Ulleung Island was soon forgotten because the reference to Silla was dropped when his poem was recorded in the ''[[Senzai Wakashū]]'' (1188). Thereafter waka poets only thought ''uruma'' as an island somewhere outside Japan with an unintelligible language. At the same time, it evoked a sense of familiarity because the phrase ''uruma no ichi'' (market in Uruma) was [[Makurakotoba|poetically associated with]] [[Mino Province]]. From the viewpoint of mainland Japanese poets, Okinawa might have been an ideal referent of ''uruma'' because, despite the exotic name of ''Ryūkyū'', the first reference to Okinawan-composed waka poems was as early as 1496. The first known identification of ''uruma'' as Okinawa Island can be found in the ''Moshiogusa'' (1513), but the association remained weak for some time. For example, [[Hokkaido]], in addition to Okinawa, was referred to as ''uruma'' in the ''Shōzaishū'' (1597). The mainland Japanese poetic practice was adopted by Okinawan waka poets in the late 17th century. The ''[[Omoidegusa]]'' (1700), a purely Japanese [[poetic diary]] by [[Shikina Seimei]], is known for its extensive use of the word ''uruma''.<ref name="yara2013">{{cite book |author=Yara Ken'ichirō 屋良健一郎 | chapter=''Ryūkyū-jin to waka'' 琉球人と和歌 |editor=Tōkyō daigaku daigakuin jinbun shakai-kei kenkyūka Nihonshigaku kenkyūshitsu 東京大学大学院人文社会系研究科・文学部日本史学研究室 |title=''Chūsei seiji shakai ronsō'' 中世政治社会論叢 |pages=73–85 |year=2013 |language=ja }}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Nakabaruiseki 01.JPG|thumb|left|Nakabaru Site, Ikei Island]]

===Early history===
In the [[Sanzan Period]] (1322–1429), or Three Kingdom period, numerous [[gusuku]], or castles were built across Okinawa Island. The area of present-day Uruma fell under the control of the Chūzan Kingdom, which covered the central area of Okinawa Island and its nearby islands. The Katsuren area of Uruma became notably prosperous in the mid-15th century. Katsuren Castle, and a surrounding jōkamachi castle town, were constructed in this period.

Under the [[Ryukyu Kingdom]] six [[magiri]], a type of regional administrative district in pre-modern Okinawa, covered areas of present-day Uruma: 'Nzatō Magiri (parts of which were also located in present-day Okinawa City), Gushichaa Magiri, Kachin magiri, and Yunagushiku Magiri. Nakagushiku Magiri included Tsuken Island.<ref name="misato" /><ref name="gushikawa-m" />

The [[Ryūkyū Kingdom]] ended in 1872 with the establishment of the [[Ryūkyū Domain]], which was soon abolished with the establishment of [[Okinawa Prefecture]] in 1879. The existing system of [[magiri]] in Uruma continued with the establishment of Okinawa Prefecture. The magiri were abolished in 1907 under Imperial Edict 46, and the central government extended the establishment of cities, towns, and village organization to Okinawa Prefecture. In 1908 the area of present-day Uruma was reorganized as the five villages of Misato, Gushikawa, Katsuren, and Yonashiro.<ref name="misato" /><ref name="gushikawa-m" />

In the pre-war period Uruma had the most productive [[sugarcane]] industry in Okinawa Prefecture due to sources of irrigation and fertile soil.

The areas of present-day Uruma were affected in [[World War II]] during the initial part of the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. L-Day, the initial land invasion of Okinawa Island, occurred on April 1, 1945. American forces swept across the island quickly, and by April 5 had secured the entirety of the Katsuren Peninsula. A smaller invasion force captured Tsuken Island on the same day, and encountered stiff resistance from the Japanese military. Tsuken Island was completely devastated by fire in the battle. After the capture of Tsuken, American forces reached Ikei Island on April 9, thus securing all the Yokatsu Islands.<ref name="ww2"/> The area that became [[Ishikawa, Okinawa|Ishikawa]] was a major refugee camp set up by the American military near the end of the battle.

===Post-war period===
[[File:1959 Kadena Air Base F-100 crash.jpg|thumb|right|1959 Okinawa F-100 crash, June 30, 1959]]

The [[Okinawa Advisory Council]], the predecessor to the [[United States Military Government of the Ryukyu Islands]] was established in Ishikawa, and temporarily became the political, educational, and cultural center of Okinawa. In 1946 the Advisory Council was moved to the village of Sashiki, now a district of Nanjō, refugees began a large-scale movement to return to their homes, and the population of Ishikawa decreased rapidly. In the aftermath of World War II the Ishikawa area of Uruma was used as a large-scale refugee camp. The camp was built and operated by the U.S. occupation forces, and is considered the starting point of the reconstruction and recovery of Okinawa after the war.<ref name="ishikawa" /><ref name="uruma-e" />

The [[1959 Okinawa F-100 crash]] occurred on June 30, 1959. In the crash, a [[United States Air Force]] [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]] on a flight from nearby [[Kadena Air Base]] suffered an engine fire and crashed into Miyamori Elementary School and surrounding houses. Eleven students and six other people in the neighborhood were killed, and 210 were injured, including 156 students at the school. The F-100 crash contributed to ill will among the Okinawan population towards the U.S. occupation authorities, and strengthened calls for the island to be returned to the control of the Japanese government.<ref name="himawari"/><ref name="himawari-r"/>

The city of Uruma was formed on April 1, 2005 from the merger of the cities of [[Gushikawa, Okinawa|Gushikawa]] and [[Ishikawa, Okinawa|Ishikawa]], and the towns of [[Katsuren, Okinawa|Katsuren]] and [[Yonashiro, Okinawa|Yonashiro]], both from [[Nakagami District, Okinawa|Nakagami District]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=うるま市 |title=ごあいさつ |url=https://www.city.uruma.lg.jp/mayor/318.html |access-date=2024-02-28 |website=うるま市 |language=ja}}</ref>

==Economy==
Uruma, despite its low amount of arable land, is noted for several agricultural products. The city, like most areas of Okinawa, produces [[sugarcane]]. [[Cut flowers]], notably [[chrysanthemum]]s, are a relatively new agricultural product. Land improvement has made small-scale [[rice]] production possible. Pigs have been raised in Uruma since the end of World War II.

Uruma produces also several specialty agricultural products. The city is noted for the production of mozuku seaweed. Tsuken Island produces a specialty variety of carrots, which are known in Japan as the "Tsuken Ninjin". "Nuchi-masu", or the "salt of life", is produced from the mineral-rich seawater of Uruma. Yamashiro-cha is a locally produced tea grown in the Yamashiro area of the city.<ref name="ishikawa" /><ref name="gushikawa" />

==Geography==
[[File:Kin Bay from Ikei Island.jpg|thumb|left|Kin Bay viewed from Ikei Island.]]
[[File:Mount Ishikawa Monument.jpg|thumb|right|Height marker on top of Mount Ishikawa.]]
Uruma is located near the center of Okinawa Island, facing east. The city occupies the southern rim of [[Kin Bay]] as well as the north of [[Nakagusuku Bay]].<ref name="d" /> The highest point in the city is [[Mount Ishikawa]] at {{Convert|204|m|ft}}.<ref name="ishikawadake" /><ref name="menseki"/>

===Rivers===
The longest river in the city is the [[Tengan River]], which runs for {{Convert|12.20|km|mi}} from [[Mount Yomitan]] ({{Convert|201|m|ft}}) to Kin Bay in the Akano district of the city.<ref name="tengan" />

===Administrative divisions===
The city includes sixty-two wards, repartited in the four former municipalities.<ref>{{Cite web |title=沖縄県 うるま市の郵便番号 - 日本郵便 |url=https://www.post.japanpost.jp/cgi-zip/zipcode.php?addr=%E6%B2%96%E7%B8%84%E7%9C%8C%E3%81%86%E3%82%8B%E3%81%BE%E5%B8%82 |access-date=2024-10-03 |website=www.post.japanpost.jp}}</ref>

==Land areas==
[[File:View of Yokatsu Islands from Katsuren Castle.jpg|thumb|right|View of Yokatsu Islands from Katsuren Castle]]

The city consists of three geographic areas: a land area on Okinawa Island proper, the [[Katsuren Peninsula]], and the eight [[Yokatsu Islands]]. The majority of the city of Uruma sits on a [[dissected plateau]], and has numerous hills and indentations. The islands of the city are flat and low-lying and are primarily composed of Ryukyuan [[limestone]].<ref name="n" />

===Okinawan mainland===
The land area of the city of Uruma on Okinawa Island includes the former cities of Ishikawa to the north and Gushikawa to the south. These areas are the most populated parts of the city, and are crossed by the [[Okinawa Expressway]] and [[Ishikawa By-pass]]. The area of Uruma on the Okinawan mainland is bordered by Kin Bay to the east, and has a long coastline with significant industrial development. The northernmost point of the city is marked by Ishikawadake ({{Convert|204|m|ft}}), a low hill on the border of Uruma and the city of Kin. The Kinbu Fishing Port is located in the Gushikawa area.<ref name="ishikawa" /><ref name="gushikawa" />

===Katsuren Peninsula===
The [[Katsuren Peninsula]] extends south from Okinawa Island and used to be incorporated as the town of Katsuren. The peninsula extends {{Convert|7.5|km|mi}} from the island, is {{Convert|1.7|km|mi}} to {{Convert|2.6|km|mi}} wide, and covers {{convert|15|km2|mi2}}. The peninsula is the home base for access to the Yokatsu Islands, as well as home to two U.S. military facilities, Camp Courtney and White Beach.<ref name="katsuren-p" />

===Yokatsu Islands===
[[File:Ikeijima Island from Miyagijima Island.jpg|thumb|left|View of Ikei Island from Miyagi Island]]

The eight [[Yokatsu Islands]] are located in Uruma City. Seven sit to the east of the Katsuren Peninsula, and one, [[Tsuken Island]], sits to the southeast.<ref name="yokatsu" />

*{{nihongo|'''Yabuchi Island'''|藪地島|Yabuchi-jima}} is one of the Yokatsu Islands located on the east of the Katsuren Peninsula. The island covers {{convert|0.62|km2|sqmi}}. The island maintained a population until three hundred years ago, but is now uninhabited. Part of the Yabuchi is used for rice cultivation. Yabuchi Island is well known for its large population of [[Trimeresurus flavoviridis|habu]], the poisonous pit viper of Okinawa, and its southern coast is dense with ''kasanori'', and Okinawan species of ''[[Ulvophyceae]]'', an edible [[algae]]. The island is home to the Yabuchi Cave Ruins, first excavated in 1959. The ruins produced a shard of pottery dating approximately 6,500 years ago. The pottery is the first of its kind of Okinawa, and the style is now called yabuchi-style pottery. The caves are home to numerous shrines associated with [[veneration of the dead|ancestor worship]] of the [[Ryukyuan religion]].<ref name="yabuchi"/><ref name="spiritual"/>
*{{nihongo|'''Henza Island'''|平安座島|Henza-jima}} is located {{Convert|3.5|km|mi}} off the Katsuren Peninsula and covers {{convert|5.22|km2|sqmi}}.<ref name="menseki"/> The majority of the island is used as an oil tank facility. The population of Henza Island is concentrated at the entrance of the island, which includes a fishing port. The island is connected to the mainland by the Mid-Sea Road, which forms part of Okinawa Prefectural Road 10. Prior to the construction of the Mid-Sea Road the channel could be crossed by foot or amphibious vehicle at low tide. Henza Island is bisected from northwest to southeast by flat limestone ridge that ranges between {{Convert|65|m|ft}} and {{Convert|90|m|ft}} in height. The island has little arable land, but is surrounded by rich fishing areas along its coral reefs.<ref name="henza" />
*{{nihongo|'''Miyagi Island'''|宮城島|Miyagi-jima}}, also known as {{nihongo|Takahari Island|高離島|Takahari-jima}}, is adjacent to the northeast coast of Henza Island. The two islands used to be separated by a shallow beach, but are now connected via landfill. The island covers {{convert|5.51|km2|sqmi}}. The island relies on the tourism industry, but also produces sugarcane and cut flowers. The irregular geological formation of the island cause numerous natural springs, notably in the northeast of the island. Miyagi has numerous historical remains, including the remains of one gusuku, the Tomari Gusuku.<ref name="miyagi"/>
*{{nihongo|'''Ikei Island'''|伊計島|Ikei-jima}}, also known as Ichihanari to residents of the island, is the easternmost of the Yokatsu Islands. It is connected to the northeastern tip of Miyagi Island by the short Ikei Ōhashi Bridge.<ref name="ikei-ohashi" /> The island covers {{convert|1.7|km2|sqmi}} and has a coastline of {{Convert|7.5|km|mi}}. The north, west, and south coasts of the island consist of inaccessible steep cliffs, which range between {{Convert|20|m|ft}} and {{Convert|30|m|ft}}.<ref name="ikei-ohashi" /> Ikei Island is relatively flat. The main settlement is on the west of the island. Ikei Island used to be home to numerous sugarcane farms, but the economy is now focused almost entirely on the tourism industry.<ref name="ikei-ohashi" /> Ikei Island has numerous archaeological sites, including shell mounds and the remains of a castle, the Ikei Gusuku. The island, which was sighted by [[Matthew Calbraith Perry|Commodore Matthew Calbraith Perry]] (1794–1858), was recorded as "Ichey Island" in the ''[[Narrative of the Expedition of an American Squadron to the China Seas and Japan]]'', published in 1856 by [[Francis L. Hawks]]. 
*{{nihongo|'''Hamahiga Island'''|浜比嘉島|Hamahiga-jima}}, also known as Bamahija-jima, sits {{Convert|3|km|mi}} from the Katsuren Peninsula directly south of Henza Island. The island is connected to Henza island by the {{Convert|1.43|km|mi}} Hamahiga Bridge. The island is roughly triangular in shape covers {{convert|2.04|km2|sqmi}}. Hamahiga Island measures {{Convert|1.7|km|mi}} from east to west and {{Convert|2|km|mi}} from north to south, and at its highest point reaches an elevation of {{Convert|78.7|m|ft}}. The island has an uneven topography with few natural inlets. The three settlements on the island are Hama on the northwest coastline, Higa on the northeast coastline, and Kaneku on the southeast coastline. Hama is home to the post office and middle school of Hamahiga Island, and the elementary school sits between Hama and Higa. All three settlements are home to a fishing port. Like the other Yokatsu Islands, Hamahiga has numerous shellmound and gusuku remains, but little archaeological excavation has been carried out on the island. Hamahiga is home to numerous sites of worship of the Ryukyuan religion, including the tombs of [[Amamikyu]] and [[Shinerikyu]]. The settlements of Hama and Higa are home to [[noro priestess]]es.<ref name="hamahiga" />
