It is bounded on the north by [[Ninh Hòa District|Ninh Hoà]] town, on the south by [[Cam Ranh]] city and on the west by [[Diên Khánh District]].

Historically, the city was known as '''Kauthara''' under rule of the [[Kingdom of Champa]]. The city is still home to the famous [[Po Nagar]] Towers built by the Champa. Being a coastal city, Nha Trang is a center for [[marine science]] based at the [[Nha Trang Oceanography Institute]]. The [[Hon Mun]] marine protected area is one of four first [[marine protected area]]s in the world admitted by the [[IUCN]].

Nha Trang is well known for its beaches and [[scuba diving]] and has developed into a popular destination for international tourists, attracting large numbers of [[Backpacking (travel)|backpackers]], as well as more affluent travelers on the south-east Asia circuit; it is already very popular with Vietnamese tourists, with Nha Trang Bay widely considered as among the world's most beautiful bays.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} Tourists are welcomed to participate in the Sea Festival, held biennially.

==Etymology==
[[Image:Nhatrang la plage.jpg|thumb|left|Nha Trang's beach]]
According to some researchers, the name ''Nha Trang'' derives from a Vietnamese spelling of the [[Cham language]] name of the site ''Ea Dran'' (literally "Reed River"), the name of the Cai River as referred to by the [[Chams|Cham people]]. From the name of this river, the name was adopted to call what is now Nha Trang, which was officially made Vietnam's territory in 1698. Ea Dran is a common Cham and Montagnard place name, same as [[Ia Drang Valley]].

As far as the recorded naming of ''Nha Trang'' is concerned, in ''Toàn tập Thiên Nam Tứ Chí Lộ Đồ Thư'', a geographical book written by a Vietnamese scholar with the family of Đỗ Bá in the second half of the 18th century, the name ''Nha Trang Môn'' ("Nha Trang gate") was mentioned.<ref name="HD">Hồng Đức bản đồ, bản dịch của Bửu Cầm và cộng sự, Viện Khảo cổ Sài Gòn xuất bản 1962.</ref> In another map dating to the 17th century, known as ''Giáp Ngọ Niên Bình Nam Đồ'' by a noble called Đoan Quận công Bùi Thế Đạt, the name ''Nha Trang Hải môn'' (Nha Trang Sea Gate) was also cited.<ref name="HD" /> In Vietnamese recorded historic bibliographies, these books are perhaps the earliest ones that mentioned this place name.

In a work by [[Lê Quý Đôn]] called ''Phủ biên tạp lục'' (1776), many Nha Trang-related names were mentioned, such as ''đầm Nha Trang, dinh Nha Trang, nguồn Nha Trang, and đèo Nha Trang''.

==History==
Kauthara, also translated as an ancient clam, is a constituent state of the empire-leading kingdom and its ruling area is located in the area from today's Fu A province to Cam Ranh. Yanpunagara, the capital of Yangpu, occupies the faith of a man and is deeply influenced by religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. However, in addition to that, the gods who formerly occupied ruled the indigenous faith in the motherland, such as Çri Maladakuthara (釋利摩落陀古笪羅) in the ancient Gur'an region in the south, are one of those who can preserve the old God Most of the old gods who dominated the motherland were replaced by brahmanist gods such as the goddess Yan Pu Nagara (楊浦那竭羅) <ref name="馬司培羅《占婆史》第一章《土地及人民》，臺灣商務印書館中譯本，6頁。">馬司培羅《占婆史》第一章《土地及人民》，臺灣商務印書館中譯本，6頁。</ref> and the Bhagavati (妻婆伽婆底), Replaced, located in Nha Trang near today. Bhagavati is mixed with Yan Pu Nagara, a goddess in the local faith, which is quite revered by the people and has dedicated ancestral temples to enshrine it.<ref>馬司培羅《占婆史》第一章《土地及人民》，臺灣商務印書館中譯本，4-5頁。</ref>

From 1653 to the 19th century, Nha Trang was a deserted area rich in wildlife (animals like [[tiger]]s) and was a part of Hà Bạc, Vĩnh Xương County, Diên Khánh Province. After just two decades in the early 20th century, Nha Trang underwent a rapid change. On August 30, 1924, the [[Governor-General of French Indochina]] decreed Nha Trang as a townlet (urban centre).<ref>According to J.O.I.C page 1689, a copy from French version kept as archives Monographical Department of Khanh Hoa Province Library.</ref> Nha Trang Townlet was established from the ancient villages of Xương Huân, Phương Câu, Vạn Thạnh, Phương Sài, and Phước Hải.

[[File:Plan de la ville de Nhatrang.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Nha Trang in 1933]]
<!--- [[File:Nha Trang before 1900.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Nha Trang in the early 20th century]. --->
During [[French Indochina]], Nha Trang was seen as [[de facto]] capital of [[Khánh Hòa Province]]. The colonial administration offices (like Envoy Office, Commanding Office, Trade Office, Post Office) were situated in Nha Trang. Local royal offices like Province Chief, Provincial Judge, Military Commander are in [[Diên Khánh]] city (a walled military city 10&nbsp; km south-west of Nha Trang).

On 7 May 1937, the [[Governor-General of French Indochina]] by another decree upgraded Nha Trang Townlet to town.<ref>According to ''Official Gazette'' number 9 of 1937 by the French colonial government, kept as an archive in Monographical Department of Khanh Hoa Library.</ref> At this time, Nha Trang Town had five wards based on the ancient villages merged to make the town: Xương Huân, Phương Câu, Vạn Thạnh, Phương Sài, and Phước Hải.

On 27 January 1958, the president of the [[Republic of Vietnam]], [[Ngô Đình Diệm]] by Decree 18-BNV abrogated the town status of Nha Trang and divided Nha Trang into two rural communes: Nha Trang Đông (Eastern Nha Trang) and Nha Trang Tây (Western Nha Trang), under the administration of Vĩnh Xương County.

During the late 1960s, the U.S. Army's First Field Force, Vietnam (1FFV) was headquartered in Nha Trang. 1FFV was a corps-level major subordinate command of the U.S. Army Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV).

On 22 October 1970, the government of the Republic of Vietnam by Decree 132-SL/NV reestablished Nha Trang Town on the ground of Nha Trang Đông and Nha Trang Tây and other rural communes. Following that establishment, the government by Decree 357-ĐUHC/NC/NĐ dated 5 June 1971 divided Nha Trang into 11 urban zones.

On 2 April 1975, communist ([[Viet Cong]]/[[Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam|PRG]]/[[Vietnam People's Army|VPA]]) forces captured the city. On 4 April 1975, [[Khánh Hòa Military Commission]] (''Ủy ban Quân quản Khánh Hòa'') divided Nha Trang into three administrative districts: District 1, District 2 and Vĩnh Xương District. In September 1975, the districts were merged to become one entity, the town of Nha Trang.

On 30 March 1977, the Council of the Government (now the cabinet) of the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] by Decision 391-CP/QĐ upgraded Nha Trang to city status, a county-level city under the administration of [[Phú Khánh Province]] (a province created by merger of now [[Phú Yên Province]] and [[Khánh Hòa Province]]). Seven communes of former Vĩnh Xương County, namely Vĩnh Thái, Vĩnh Ngọc, Vĩnh Hiệp, Vĩnh Lương, Vĩnh Trung, Vĩnh Thạnh, Vĩnh Phương was split from Khánh Xương County to become Nha Trang City territory.

On 27 March 1978, the provincial government by Decision 54-BT founded Phước Đồng Commune under Nha Trang City.

On 1 July 1989, Khanh Hoa was split from Phu Khanh Province to become [[Khánh Hòa Province]] as it was before, Nha Trang was made the capital of Khánh Hòa Province. On April 22, 1999, [[Phan Văn Khải]] by Decision 106/1999 recognized Nha Trang City as a second-class municipal city. On April 22, 2009, former Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng recognized Nha Trang City as a first-class municipal city.

==Geography==
Nha Trang city has a metropolitan area of {{cvt|251|km2}} and population of about 500,000. It borders [[Ninh Hòa]] town in the north, [[Cam Ranh]] city in the south, [[Diên Khánh]] town in the west and the [[South China Sea|East Sea]] to the east. The city is on the beautiful Nha Trang Bay, which was chosen by ''[[Travel + Leisure]]'' in two succeeding years as one of 29 most beautiful bays in the world. Nha Trang is surrounded on all three sides by mountains and a large island and four smaller ones on the fourth side (in the ocean directly in front of the city's main area), blocking major storms from potentially damaging the city.

==Administrative divisions==

Nha Trang is subdivided into 22 wards and communes, of which 14 are urban wards: Vĩnh Hải, Vĩnh Phước, Vĩnh Thọ, Vạn Thạnh, Phương Sơn, Ngọc Hiệp, Phước Hòa, Tân Tiến (founded in November 2024), Phước Hải, Lộc Thọ, Vĩnh Nguyên, Vĩnh Trường, Phước Long, Vĩnh Hòa; and 8 suburban communes: Vĩnh Phương, Vĩnh Trung, Vĩnh Thạnh, Vĩnh Thái, Vĩnh Hiệp, Vĩnh Ngọc, Vĩnh Lương, and Phước Đồng. 

Since 1998, due to the high pace of urbanization, many urban planned zones have been built: Hòn Rớ, Bắc Việt, Thánh Gia, Đường Đệ, and Nam Hòn Khô.

==Education==
Nha Trang is home to the [[multidisciplinary]] [[Nha Trang University]] (formerly Nha Trang Fishery University); the Naval and Aviation Academy; a teachers' training college; Khanh Hoa University, as well as the [[Nha Trang Oceanography Institute]] a unique institute of oceanography in Vietnam and the [[Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang]], one of the many famous [[Pasteur Institute]]s.

===Nha Trang Pasteur Institute===
The French-Swiss bacteriologist [[Alexandre Yersin]], discoverer of the ''[[Yersinia pestis]]'' bacterium lived in Nha Trang for 50 years and was affectionately known as ''Ông Năm''. He established the Indochinese Pasteur Institute (now known as the [[Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang]]), devoted to researching the [[bubonic plague]]. Yersin died in Nha Trang on 1 March 1943. A street in the city is named after him, and a shrine has been built over his tomb. There is a Yersin Museum dedicated to his achievements.

==Economy==
Nha Trang's economy relies largely on tourism. In the suburban areas around the city, the shipbuilding industry has developed and contributed significantly to the local economy. Fishery and services are also important to the city. Khanh Hoa Province in general and Nha Trang is particular are among the largest contributors to Vietnam's annual budget revenues. [[Lobster farming]] on the sea is an important industry for the people living in suburban areas.

To the south of the city, by Cam Ranh Bay, several industrial parks are under construction and have been partly available for investors. Once the construction of the deep-water port on [[Vân Phong Bay]] has been completed, this area will become the third important economic zone in the province (besides Nha Trang and Cam Ranh).

Nha Trang is one of the most important tourist hubs of Vietnam, thanks to its beaches with fine and clean sand and the clear ocean water with mild temperatures all year round. There are several resorts &mdash; such as Vinpearl, Diamond Bay and Ana Mandara &mdash; and amusement and water parks, in the city and on islands off the coast. The possibly most beautiful street of Nha Trang is [[Tran Phu Street]] along the seaside, sometimes referred to as the [[Pacific Coast Highway (California)|Pacific Coast Highway]] of Vietnam.

Lying off Nha Trang is the [[Hon Tre Island]] (Bamboo Island), with a major resort operated by the Vinpearl Group. The [[Vinpearl Cable Car]], a [[gondola lift]] system, links the mainland to the five-star resort and theme park on Hon Tre Island.

Nha Trang is a stopover for annual yacht races starting in Hong Kong. In recent years, the city has welcomed many five-star sea cruises. In addition to sailboat racing, Nha Trang provides a rich variety of tourist activities for visitors. Island hopping, scuba diving, water sports and other sporting activities can be enjoyed. The Nha Trang Tourist Information Center (a non-governmental organisation), located near the [[Cho Dam Market]] has been set up to provide information for visitors.<ref>NhaTrang live info center</ref>

The local cuisine is most famous for fresh seafood and barbecued pork rolled in rice paper. The area's [[bird's nest soup]] is deemed one of the best in Vietnam. Bird's nests are collected in the wild, on bird farms on the islands off the coast and even in some houses in the inner city. The farmed bird in question belongs to the [[swiftlet]] group, popularly referred to as ''yến hàng'' (''[[Aerodramus fuciphagus]]'' and ''[[Germain's swiftlet|A. germani]]'').

When [[Cam Ranh Bay]] used to be an important naval base, [[Nha Trang Air Base|Nha Trang Airport]] was the main airport of the city. This airport was used by the [[United States Air Force]] and Republic of Vietnam Air Force during the [[Vietnam War]]. When part of Cam Ranh Bay was made an economic development zone by the Vietnamese government, [[Cam Ranh International Airport]] (also a military airport built by the United States during Vietnam War) was made the new civilian airport of the city. This airport is located by Cam Ranh Bay, {{cvt|28|km|mi}} south of the city and was (as of 2007) the fourth busiest airport in passenger traffic in Vietnam serving more than 683,000 passengers in 2008. As of 2016, the airport has domestic connections to [[Hanoi]], [[Hồ Chí Minh City]], Hải Phòng, [[Đà Nẵng]], [[Vinh]].

The city is next to the [[National Route 1 (Vietnam)|National Route 1]], the backbone north–south road of the country. The [[North–South Railway (Vietnam)|Reunification Railway]] crosses the city and stops at [[Nha Trang Railway Station]]. The construction work of [[Vân Phong Port]], north of the city, a deep-water project capable of handling ships up to 100,000 tonnes, and with a capacity of 100 million tonnes of cargo per annum, is under progress by a consortium of Japanese corporations. The estimated investment capital for this port-city complex project is expected to reach US$15 billion.
