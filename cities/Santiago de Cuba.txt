Historically Santiago de Cuba was the second-most important city on the island after Havana, and remains the second-largest. It is on a bay connected to the [[Caribbean Sea]] and an important [[sea port]]. In the 2022, the city of Santiago de Cuba recorded a population of 507,167 people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Santiago de Cuba (Municipality, Cuba) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/cuba/admin/santiago_de_cuba/3406__santiago_de_cuba/ |access-date=2024-02-01 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref>

Santiago de Cuba was the seventh village founded by Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] on 25 July 1515. The settlement was destroyed by fire in 1516, and was immediately rebuilt. This was the starting point of the expeditions led by [[Juan de Grijalba]] and [[Hernán Cortés]] to the coasts of Mexico in 1518, and in 1538 by [[Hernando de Soto (explorer)|Hernando de Soto]]'s expedition to Florida. The first [[cathedral]] was built in the city in 1528. From 1522 until 1589, Santiago was the capital of the Spanish colony of Cuba.

The city was plundered by French forces in 1553, and by English forces [[Raid on Santiago de Cuba (1603)|in 1603]]. More than 50 years later the English raided again in 1662 under [[Christopher Myngs]].

The city had a huge influx of French and British immigrants in the late-18th and early-19th centuries. Some eighteen thousand [[Saint Dominicans|Saint Dominican]] refugees, both ethnic French whites and free people of color, and African [[freedmen]], came from [[Saint-Domingue]] in the summer of 1803 during the last days of the [[Haitian Revolution|Haitian slave revolt, which had started in 1791]].<ref name="scott">[https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1075&context=book_chapters Rebecca J. Scott and Jean M. Hébrard, "Rosalie of the Poulard Nation"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201127050340/https://repository.law.umich.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1075&context=book_chapters |date=27 November 2020 }}, ''Assumed Identities: The Meanings of Race in the Atlantic World'', ed. by John D. Garrigus, Christopher Charles Morris, Texas A&M University Press, 2010, p. 125</ref> Other refugees had emigrated from Saint-Domingue earlier in the revolution. Haiti declared its independence as a republic in 1804.

The French were withdrawing surviving troops after suffering heavy losses from warfare and [[yellow fever]]. The immigrants, who included freedmen as France had abolished slavery on Saint-Domingue, struggled to maintain their freedom in Cuba, which was still a slave society. Cuba initially allowed only white refugees, women of color, children, and loyal "domestics" to land; French troops and all men of color over the age of thirteen were held off shore, to be rapidly deported to the mainland, as they were considered a revolutionary threat.<ref name="scott" /> Some French soldiers joined other refugees in [[Charleston, South Carolina]], or New York City; others went to [[New Orleans]].

The refugees who stayed added to the city's eclectic cultural mix, already rich with Spanish and African culture. Some of the women and children were impressed into slavery again, although they had been free. In 1809, after [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s forces invaded Spain, French citizens were ordered out of Cuba.<ref name="scott127">Scott and Hébrard (2010), "Rosalie", p. 127</ref> Most went to the United States, and thousands settled in New Orleans, with the freedmen increasing its African culture, as most had been born in Africa. The ethnic French whites and free people of color, generally with longer ties to French culture, added their flavor to the culture of the city as well.

Near the end of the century, during the [[Spanish–American War]], Santiago was the site of the major defeat of Spanish troops at [[San Juan Hill]] on 1 July 1898. After capturing the surrounding hills, United States General [[William Rufus Shafter]] laid siege to the city.<ref name="Nugent. Walter 2008. p 301">Nugent. Walter. ''Habits of Empire, A History of American Expansion''. New York: Alfred A Knopf, 2008. p 301</ref> Spain later surrendered to the United States after Admiral [[William T.

[[José Martí]], a Cuban poet, writer, and national hero, is buried in [[Santa Ifigenia Cemetery]] in this city.

=== Role in the Cuban Revolution ===
[[File:Santiago-de-Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|Street in central Santiago in 1974]]Santiago was the home of the 20th-century revolutionary hero [[Frank País]]. On 26 July 1953, the [[Cuban Revolution]] began with an ill-prepared armed attack on the [[Moncada Barracks]] by a small contingent of rebels led by [[Fidel Castro]]. Shortly after this disastrous incident, País began talking with students and young working people informally, drawing around him what became an extremely effective urban revolutionary alliance. He and his followers developed highly organized cells, coordinating a large-scale urban resistance that became instrumental in the success of the Cuban Revolution.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cannon |first=Terrance |year=1981 |url=http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/pais.htm |title=Frank País and the Underground Movement in the cities |publisher=historyofcuba.com |access-date=21 May 2006 |archive-date=18 June 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618211454/http://historyofcuba.com/history/pais.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

País' group prepared carefully, accruing weapons, collecting money and medical supplies. They published a cheap newsletter that reported news critical of the government, attempting to counter Batista's censorship of the mainline press.<ref>{{cite web |year=1981 |url=http://www.historyofcuba.com/history/pais.htm |title=Who was Frank Pais? |publisher=historyofcuba.com |access-date=21 May 2006 |archive-date=18 June 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618211454/http://historyofcuba.com/history/pais.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the summer of 1955, País's organization merged with Castro's 26 July Movement. País became the leader of the new organization in [[Oriente province]]. Two years later he was betrayed to the police and was fatally shot after his capture.

On 1 January 1959, [[Fidel Castro]] proclaimed the victory of the [[Cuban Revolution]] from a balcony on Santiago de Cuba's city hall. The ashes of País were interred in Santa Ifigenia Cemetery, where Marti had been buried.

Santiago de Cuba was the hometown of poet [[José María Heredia]]. The Teatro Heredia, which hosts theater and cultural events, is named in his honor. The mural relief portrait on the building façade depicts [[Juan Almeida Bosque]], a commander of insurgent forces in the Cuban Revolution.

It <!-- The city? a building? -->is the birthplace of the world-famous [[Bacardi]] brand, which was started by [[Facundo Bacardi Masso]] in 1862. It <!-- Which it? -->now houses a museum that displays the extensive art collection of the [[Emilio Bacardi|Bacardí]] family.

Santiago de Cuba is well known for its cultural life. Some of Cuba's most famous musicians, including [[Compay Segundo]], [[Ibrahim Ferrer]] and [[Eliades Ochoa]] (all of whom participated in the film ''[[Buena Vista Social Club (film)|Buena Vista Social Club]]'') and trova composer [[Ñico Saquito]] (Benito Antonio Fernández Ortiz) were born in the city or in one of the villages surrounding it. They have contributed to the typical, country-like music of the city.

Santiago de Cuba is well known for its traditional music, most notably [[Son (music)|son]], from which [[Salsa (dance)|salsa]] has been derived. The city celebrates [[Carnival]] in July, although it typically precedes Lent. With the city preoccupied with the holiday, Castro chose 26 July to enter undetected into the city to assault the Moncada Barracks. During Carnival, traditional [[Conga (music)|conga]] music is played in the streets on a traditional pentatonic trumpet, called the [[trompeta china]].
[[File:Children Playing Chess on the Street - Santiago de Cuba - Cuba.jpg|thumb|Boys playing chess]]

A relatively high number of residents of the city adhere to Afro-Cuban religions, most notably [[santería]]. The city hosts an important community of descendants of immigrants from the early 19th century from what is now Haiti. Some aspects of the religious "[[Haitian Voodoo|vodún]]" heritage of the city can be traced back to this community.

The city features several historic architectural styles, from [[Baroque]] to [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]]. Many colonial buildings have huge windows and balconies, where people can enjoy views of the steep streets and wooded hills. Preserved historical treasures include the first Spanish dwelling in the [[Americas]]<!-- ?What is this? -->, the first cathedral in Cuba, [[Cobre mine, Cuba|Cobre mine]], the first copper mine opened in the Americas; and the first Cuban museum.

[[File:Moncada, Santiago de Cuba.jpg|thumb|[[Moncada Barracks]]]]
Santiago is served by [[Antonio Maceo Airport]]. [[Cubana de Aviación]] connects the city with [[Havana]], [[Port Au Prince]], and [[Santo Domingo]], with other airlines connecting to other cities in the Caribbean and North America.

The public transport in the city, as in Havana, is carried out by two divisions, Omnibus Metropolitanos (OM) and Metrobus.<ref name=Censo_transporte>{{cite web |url=http://www.one.cu/aec2009/datos/13TRANSPORTE.pdf |title=Anuario estadístico de cuba 2009 transporte |access-date=2011-07-05 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822200546/http://www.one.cu/aec2009/datos/13TRANSPORTE.pdf |archive-date=22 August 2011}} National Statistics Office – Transportation</ref> The Metrobus serves the inner-city urban area, with a maximum distance of {{cvt|20|km|0}}.<ref name="Censo_transporte" /> Omnibus Metropolitanos (OM) connects the adjacent towns and municipalities in the metropolitan area with the city center, with a maximum distance of {{cvt|40|km|0}}.<ref name="Censo_transporte" />

[[Ferrocarriles de Cuba]] railways and ASTRO inter-city buses connect the city with Havana's [[Havana Central railway station|Central Railway Station]] and with most other main cities of Cuba. The [[Santiago de Cuba railway station|main railway station]], also known as "General Senén Casas", is an important hub of the national railways. Located in the city centre, near the harbour, it was completely rebuilt in 1997.{{citation needed|date=October 2023}}

The city of Santiago is also crossed by the [[Carretera Central (Cuba)|Carretera Central]] highway and by the southern section of the [[Autopista A1 (Cuba)|A1 motorway]], largely unbuilt, that will link it with Havana when it is completed.
