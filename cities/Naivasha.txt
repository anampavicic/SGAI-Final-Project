'''Naivasha''' is a town in [[Nakuru County]], [[Kenya]], {{cvt|92.8|km}} north west of [[Nairobi]]. From 1969, the population expanded by a factor of 17 times to over 198,000 at the 2019 census. It is situated on the shores of [[Lake Naivasha]], from which it takes its name. The name ''Naivasha'' derives from the local [[Maasai language|Maasai]] word ''ɛnaɨpɔ́sha'', meaning "that which heaves", a common Maasai word for bodies of water larger enough to have wave action when it is windy or stormy. Naivasha arose as the British attempted to pronounce the Maasai name.  Literally, ''Lake Naivasha'' means "Lake Lake" and ''Naivasha Town'' means "Lake Town".

==Location==
Naivasha lies in a rift valley basin {{cvt|92.8|km}} by road north west of [[Nairobi]].

==History==
The [[Maasai people|Maasai]] people were the first group to settle on the basin due to their quest for pasture and water for their livestock. This is rumored to have been around the 15th century when they moved down from the present day Sudan. Later in the 16th century, the [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] people including various tribes started their migration into the basin from the Central African forests. The most populous tribe in Naivasha is the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]]. European settlers are also major settlers in Naivasha. They arrived in the 19th century.

The town is home to the Isahakia community, descendants of [[Isaaq]] soldiers and traders that settled in Kenya in the 1900s.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kenya:The Story of a Fourth Generation Isahakia Community in Naivasha Kenya from Somaliland|url=https://www.horndiplomat.com/2016/10/13/kenyathe-story-of-a-fourth-generation-isahakia-community-in-naivasha-kenya-from-somaliland/?amp_markup=1|access-date=2021-02-08|website=www.horndiplomat.com|date = 13 October 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=K24TV|date=29 October 2016|title=Government to recognize the Isahakia community as Kenyans|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=pJu5e_tdZWM|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=[[YouTube]]}}</ref>
In the late 1970s–1980s Lake Naivasha was overrun with poachers and foreign creatures were introduced into the lake to provide fishing.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The migratory paths along Lake Naivasha were being destroyed by the local rose industry.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The naturalist [[Joan Root]] (1936–2006), spent the last decade of her life trying to save the lake and its wildlife.

A resort in Naivasha was the location for much of the negotiations of the [[Comprehensive Peace Agreement]] ending the [[Second Sudanese Civil War]], commonly known as the "Naivasha Agreement".
