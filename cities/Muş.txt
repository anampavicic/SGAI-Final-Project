== Etymology ==
Various explanations of the origin of Muş's name exist. Its name is sometimes associated with the [[Armenian language|Armenian]] word {{transliteration|hy|mshush}}, meaning fog, explained by the fact that the town and the surrounding plain are frequently covered in fog in the mornings.<ref name="Mush">{{cite book|last1=Hakobyan|first1=Tadevos Kh.|url=http://www.nayiri.com/imagedDictionaryBrowser.jsp?dictionaryId=61&query=%D5%B4%D5%B8%D6%82%D5%B7|title=Հայաստանի և հարակից շրջանների տեղանունների բառարան [Dictionary of toponymy of Armenia and adjacent territories]|last2=Melik-Bakhshyan|first2=Stepan T.|last3=Barseghyan|first3=Hovhannes Kh.|date=1991|publisher=Yerevan State University Press|volume=3|location=Yerevan|page=892|language=hy}}</ref> The 17th-century explorer [[Evliya Çelebi]] relates a myth where a giant mouse created by Nemrud ([[Nimrod]]) destroys the city and its inhabitants, after which the city was named Muş ({{transliteration|fa|muš}} means "mouse" in Persian).<ref name=":0">{{citation |last=Petrosyan |first=Armen |title=The Indo-European and Ancient Near Eastern Sources of the Armenian Epic |date=2002 |url=https://www.academia.edu/3656244 |pages=140–142 |place=Washington, D.C. |publisher=Institute for the Study of Man |isbn=9780941694810}}.</ref> Others have proposed a connection with the names of different ancient [[Anatolian languages|Anatolian]] peoples, the [[Mushki]] or the [[Mysians]], or the toponyms ''Mushki'' and ''Mushuni'' mentioned in [[Assyria]]n and [[Hittites|Hittite]] sources, respectively.<ref name=":0" />{{Sfn|Hakobyan|1987|p=198}}

An inscription belonging to [[Urartu|Urartian]] King [[Argishti I of Urartu|Argisti I]] (785-765 BC) was unearthed near [[Kepenek Castle]]. The inscription is now under protection by the Muş Provincial Directorate of Culture and Tourism. The inscription in question reads:

The date of foundation of Mush is unknown, although a settlement is believed to have been around by the time of [[Menua]], the king of [[Urartu]] (c. 800 BC), whose cuneiform inscription was found in the city's vicinity.{{sfn|Hakobyan|1987|p=199}} During the [[Middle Ages]], Mush was the center of the [[Taron (historic Armenia)|Taron]] region of Armenia. It is first mentioned as a city in Armenian manuscripts of the 9th and 10th centuries. In the late 8th century, Mush, along with the Taron region, came under control of the Armenian [[Bagratid Armenia|Bagratid (Bagratuni) dynasty]], who reconquered it from the [[Arabs]]. Mush and the Taron region were captured and annexed to the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 969.<ref name="Syrian Christians Under Islam">{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=David Richard|title=Syrian Christians Under Islam: The First Thousand Years|date=2001|publisher=BRILL|isbn=9789004120556|pages=160}}</ref>

[[File:Armenian monastery of s apostles in moush.jpg|thumb|4th-century [[Arakelots Monastery]] before its destruction during the [[Armenian Genocide]].]]
After the 11th century, the town was ruled by Islamic dynasties such as the [[Ahlatshahs]], [[Ayyubids]], [[Ilkhanids]] and [[Kara Koyunlu]]. In the 10th-13th centuries Mush developed into a major city with an estimated population of 20 to 25 thousand people.{{sfn|Hakobyan|1987|pp=-199-200}} In 1387 the central Asian ruler [[Timur]] crossed the area and apparently captured Mush town without a battle.<ref name="Eastern Turkey" /> Later the [[Aq Qoyunlu|Akkoyunlu]] ruled the area and in the 16th the Ottomans took control over the town and region in the 16th century from the Persian [[Safavids]]. Mush remained part of the Ottoman Empire till the early 20th century and during these times retained a large Armenian population. In 1821 [[Ottoman–Persian War (1821–1823)|a Persian invasion]] reached Mush.<ref name="Eastern Turkey" />
