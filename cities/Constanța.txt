Ethnic [[Romanians]] became a majority in the city in the early 20th century. The city still has small [[Tatar]] and [[Greek people|Greek]] communities, which were substantial in previous centuries, as well as [[Turkish people|Turkish]] and [[Romani people|Romani]] residents, among others. Constanța has a rich multicultural heritage, as, throughout history, it has been part of different cultures, including Roman, Byzantine, Bulgarian and Ottoman. Following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]], Constanța became part of Romania, and the city, which at the time had a population of just over 5,000 inhabitants, grew significantly throughout the 20th century.

===Ancient history===
Tomis was founded in the 6th century BC as a [[Greek colony]]<ref>{{Cite book |author=Eusebios–Hieronymos |author-link=Jerome |editor=Ibarez, Josh Miguel Blasco |title=Hieronymi Chronicon |page=167 |url=http://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_05_latin_part1.htm |year=2005 |access-date=2007-04-27 |language=la |archive-date=23 January 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240123202835/https://www.tertullian.org/fathers/jerome_chronicle_05_latin_part1.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> as were nearby the colonies of [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]], [[Orgame]] and [[Kallatis]] in the same era.
	
The site had the advantage of a fine harbour, the Carasu valley offering an inland shortcut from the sea to the Danube, and fertile land nearby.<ref>Zaharia, L.; Pișota, I. (2003). "Apele Dobrogei" (PDF). Analele Universității București: Geografie (in Romanian): 116–117</ref> The peninsula on which it was sited has high cliffs protecting Tomis from cold winds and from attack.<ref>Alexandru Suceveanu, (1977): 42, Maria Barbulescu, (2001): p 23</ref>

Most of the ancient city is covered by the modern day Constanta, making archaeology difficult.

In the 5th century BC it was under the influence of the [[Delian League]], passing in this period from [[oligarchy]] to [[Athenian democracy|democracy]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Aristotle |author-link=Aristotle |title=Aristotle's Politics |editor=Jowett, Benjamin |chapter="Politics", Book V, 6 |url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/a8po/complete.html |chapter-url=http://ebooks.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/a8po/book5.html |year=2000 |location=Adelaide |publisher=University of Adelaide |access-date=2007-04-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222064513/http://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/a8po/ |archive-date=February 22, 2008 }}</ref> 

The war for the ''emporion'' of Tomis took place in the middle of the 3rd century BC.<ref>Memnon, FHG III, p. 537.</ref>

In 29 BC the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] captured the region from the [[Odrysian kingdom]] and annexed it as far as the Danube.

It was a member, perhaps the capital, of the Hexapolis alliance of Greek cities with [[Histria (ancient city)|Histria]], [[Callatis]], [[Dionysupolis]], [[Varna, Bulgaria|Odessos]] and [[Mesembria (Zone)|Mesambria]].

In AD 8, the Roman poet [[Ovid]] (43 BC–17 AD) was banished to Tomis by Emperor [[Augustus]] for the last eight years of his life.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ovid-Roman-poet | access-date=February 22, 2024 | title=Ovid | first=Edward John | last=Kenney | series=Encyclopaedia Britannica | archive-date=2 February 2024 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240202234450/https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ovid-Roman-poet | url-status=live }}</ref> He lamented his Tomisian exile in his poems ''[[Tristia]]'' and ''[[Epistulae ex Ponto]]''. Tomis was "by his account a town located in a war-stricken cultural wasteland on the remotest margins of the empire".<ref>The Cambridge Companion to Ovid ed. Philip Hardie p.235.</ref>

A number of inscriptions found in and around the city show that Constanța stands over the site of Tomis.<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Constantza|volume=7|page=11}}</ref> Some of these finds are now preserved in the [[British Museum]] in London.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=95085&peoA=95085-3-9|title=Collection search: You searched for|website=British Museum|access-date=2016-07-22|archive-date=2015-10-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017194816/http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?people=95085&peoA=95085-3-9|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city was afterwards included in the Province of [[Moesia]] and, from the time of [[Diocletian]], in [[Scythia Minor (Roman province)|Scythia Minor]] of which it was the capital. 

In 269 the city was attacked by the [[Goths]] who succeeded in destroying only suburbs outside the walls.<ref>Wolfram, Herwig (1990). History of the Goths. Translated by Dunlap, Thomas J. University of California Press. ISBN 0520069838 pp 52-56</ref> 

The city lay at the seaward end of the [[Trajan's Wall|Great Wall of Trajan]]. Tomis was later called Constantiana, possibly in honour of [[Flavia Julia Constantia|Constantia]], the half-sister of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] Emperor [[Constantine the Great]] or his son [[Constantius II]], a name mentioned for the town by [[Procopius|Procopius of Caesarea]]. In 395, Tomis was assigned to the [[Eastern Roman Empire]].

===Middle Ages===

During [[Maurice's Balkan campaigns]], Tomis was besieged by the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]] in the winter of 597/598. It was conquered at the [[Battle of Ongal]] by the [[First Bulgarian Empire]] in 680. It stayed under Bulgarian rule until the Byzantines under [[John I Tzimiskes]] retook it in the [[Sviatoslav's invasion of Bulgaria|Rus-Byzantine War of 970-971]]. Tomis was then seized by the [[Second Bulgarian Empire]] during the [[Uprising of Asen and Peter]] in 1186.

By the 14th century Italian nautical maps used the name Constanza.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Andrews |first=Smaranda |title=Greek cities on the western coast of the Black Sea: Orgame, Histria, Tomis, and Kallatis (7th to 1st century BCE) |url=https://www.academia.edu/98870194 |journal=Academia.edu |access-date=12 November 2023 |archive-date=12 November 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231112143504/https://www.academia.edu/98870194/Greek_cities_on_the_western_coast_of_the_Black_Sea_Orgame_Histria_Tomis_and_Kallatis_7th_to_1st_century_BCE_ |url-status=live }}</ref>

After almost 200 years as part of Bulgaria, and becoming subsequently an independent principality of [[Dobrotitsa]]/Dobrotici and of [[Wallachia]] under [[Mircea I of Wallachia]], Constanța fell under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] rule around 1419.

===Recent history===

[[File:Constanţa Generala 1909.jpg|thumb|right|Constanța panorama in 1910]]
[[File:Cercul Militar Constanta, fosta Prefectura.jpeg|thumb|right|Constanța Prefecture (nowadays the Constanța Military Circle) damaged during city's occupation by the Central Powers (1916{{ndash}}1918)]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv N 1603 Bild-027, Konstanza, Siebelfähren im Hafen.jpg|thumb|right|The [[port of Constanța]] in 1941]]

A railroad linking Constanța to [[Cernavodă]] was laid in 1860. In spite of damage done by railway contractors considerable remains of ancient walls, pillars, etc. came to light.<ref name="EB1911"/> What is thought to have been a port building was excavated, and revealed the substantial remains of one of the longest [[mosaic]] pavements in the world.

In 1878, after the [[Romanian War of Independence]], Constanța and the rest of [[Northern Dobruja]] were ceded by the [[Ottoman Empire]] to Romania. The city became Romania's main seaport and the transit point for much of Romania's exports.  The [[Constanța Casino]], a historic monument and a symbol of the modern city, was the first building constructed on the shore of the Black Sea after Dobruja came under Romanian administration, with the cornerstone being laid in 1880.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cazino Constanta|url=https://www.litoralulromanesc.ro/cazino.htm|website=Litoralul Romanesc|access-date=27 March 2018|archive-date=29 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329121118/https://www.litoralulromanesc.ro/cazino.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

On 22 October 1916 (during [[Second Battle of Cobadin|World War I]]), the [[Central Powers]] (German, Turkish and Bulgarian troops) occupied Constanța.  According to the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] of May 1918, article X.b.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/routreat.html|title=Article X of the Treaty|access-date=14 December 2018|archive-date=24 March 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190324234829/https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/routreat.html}}</ref> (a treaty never ratified by Romania), Constanța remained under the joint control of the Central Powers. The city came afterwards under Bulgarian rule after a [[wikisource:bg:Протокол за предаване на Северна Добруджа на България и за поправка на българо-турската граница по река Марица|protocol]] regarding the transfer of the jointly administered zone in Northern Dobruja to Bulgaria had been signed in Berlin on 24 September 1918, by Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria.<ref name="entangled">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R3cEDgAAQBAJ&q=berlin+protocol+dobruja+september+1918&pg=PA358|title=Entangled Histories of the Balkans|author=Roumen Dontchev Daskalov|author2=Diana Mishkova|author3=Tchavdar Marinov|author4=Alexander Vezenkov|date=30 January 2017|page=358|volume=4|publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-25075-8|access-date=3 March 2021|archive-date=22 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230922021045/https://books.google.com/books?id=R3cEDgAAQBAJ&q=berlin+protocol+dobruja+september+1918&pg=PA358|url-status=live}}</ref> The agreement was short-lived: five days later, on 29 September, Bulgaria capitulated after the [[Vardar Offensive|successful offensive]] on the [[Macedonian front]] (see the [[Armistice of Salonica]]), and the Allied troops liberated the city in 1918.

In the interwar years, the city became Romania's main commercial hub, so that by the 1930s over half of its exports were exiting via the port. During [[World War II]], when Romania joined the [[Axis powers]], Constanța was a major target for the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] bombers. While the town was left relatively unscathed, the port suffered extensive damage, recovering only in the early 1950s.

Following the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine]],  the blockading of the Ukrainian Black Sea ports led to renewed interest in the port of Constanta as one possible outlet for transporting grain to the rest of the world.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Photos: Romanian port becomes key transit hub for Ukrainian grain |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/6/16/photos-romanian-port-becomes-key-transit-hub-for-ukrainian-grain |access-date=2022-06-19 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en |archive-date=2022-06-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220619145705/https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/6/16/photos-romanian-port-becomes-key-transit-hub-for-ukrainian-grain |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Geography==
Constanța is the administrative center of the county with the [[Constanța County|same name]] and the largest city in the [[Sud-Est (development region)|Southeastern development region]] of Romania. The city is located on the [[Black Sea]] coast, with a beach length of {{convert|13|km|0|abbr=off}}. [[Mamaia]], a district of Constanța, is the largest and most modern resort on the Romanian coast. [[Mineral springs]] in the surrounding area and [[beachgoing]] attract many visitors in summer.

===Ovid's Square===

The [[Augustus|Emperor Augustus]] exiled the Roman poet [[Ovid]] to what was then Tomis in 8 AD.  In 1887 the sculptor [[Ettore Ferrari]] designed a statue of the poet which gave its name to this square in the old town.  In 1916, during the occupation of Dobruja by the [[Central Powers]], it was taken down by [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] troops, but was later reinstated by the [[German Empire|Germans]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://romania.europalibera.org/a/stergerea-memoriei-sau-rescrierea-istoriei-cand-a-daramat-romania-prima-statuie/30665862.html|title=Ștergerea memoriei sau rescrierea istoriei.

The statue stands in front of the [[Constanța History and Archaeology Museum|National History and Archaeology Museum]] which is housed in the old City Hall and contains a large collection of ancient art..

===Archaeology Park (''Parcul Arheologic'')===

In the heart of Constanța, the park displays dozens of vestiges of the city's past including columns, amphorae, capitals, fragments of 3rd and 4th-century buildings, and a 6th-century tower.

===Roman Mosaics (''Edificiul Roman cu Mozaic'')===

A vast complex of late Roman buildings on three levels once linked the upper town to the harbor and marked its commercial center. Today, only about a third of the original structures remain in Ovid's Square, including more than {{convert|9150|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of colourful, if poorly maintained, mosaics. Archaeological traces point to the existence of workshops, warehouses and shops in the area. Remains of the Roman public baths can be seen nearby. Roman aqueducts once brought water {{convert|6|mi|0|abbr=out}} to the town.

===Genoese Lighthouse (''Farul Genovez'')===

Soaring {{convert|26|ft|m}}, the [[Genoese Lighthouse]] was built in 1860 by the Danubius and Black Sea Company to honor Genoese merchants who established a flourishing sea trade community here in the 13th century.

===Casino (''Cazinoul'')===

Commissioned by King Carol I in 1910 and designed by architects Daniel Renard and Petre Antonescu right on the seashore, the derelict [[Constanța Casino]] features sumptuous Art Nouveau architecture. Once a huge attraction for European tourists, the casino lost its customers after the collapse of Communism. In 2021 renovation of the building finally began.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-01-10 |title=Renovations for famous Constanta Casino in Romania can finally begin |url=https://heritagetribune.eu/romania/famous-constanta-casino-in-romania-can-finally-begin/ |access-date=2022-06-19 |website=European Heritage Tribune |language=en-US |archive-date=2022-10-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221007103336/https://heritagetribune.eu/romania/famous-constanta-casino-in-romania-can-finally-begin/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Constanța Aquarium]] is nearby. 

===House with Lions (''Casa cu Lei'')===

Blending pre-Romanesque and Genoese architectural styles, this late 19th century building features four columns adorned with imposing sculptured lions. During the 1930s, its elegant salons hosted the Constanța Masonic Lodge.

===National Opera and Ballet Theater Oleg Danovski===
Built in 1957 to host theatre productions and operas, the state-funded Dobrogean Musical Theater hosted a multitude of shows written by some of Romania's most prolific composers and playwrights. In 1978, master choreographer [[:ro:Oleg_Danovski|Oleg Danovski]] formed the Classical and Contemporary Ballet Ensemble, revitalising the theater's significance. After Danovski's death in 1996, the shows slowed down, and in 2004 the theater was closed by the Culture Department of the City Council.

===Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul===
Constructed in neo-Byzantine style between 1883 and 1885, the [[Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, Constanța|church]] was severely damaged during World War II and was restored in 1951. The interior murals combine neo-Byzantine style with purely Romanian elements best observed in the iconostasis and pews, chandeliers and candlesticks (bronze and brass alloy), all designed by Ion Mincu and manufactured in Paris.

===Grand Mosque of Constanța (''Marea Moschee din Constanța'')===
Built in 1910 by King Carol I, the [[Grand Mosque of Constanța]] (originally the Carol I Mosque) is the seat of the Mufti, the spiritual leader of the 55,000 Muslims (Turks and Tatars by origin) who live along the coast of the Dobrogea region. The building combines Neo-Byzantine and Romanian architectural elements, making it one of the most distinctive mosques in the area. The highlight of the interior is a large Turkish carpet, a gift from [[Abdul Hamid II|Sultan Abdülhamid II]]; woven at the [[Hereke]] factory in Turkey, it is one of the largest carpets in Europe, weighing 1,080 pounds. The {{convert|164|ft|m|abbr=on}} minaret (tower) provides views of the old part of town and the harbor. Five times a day, the muezzin climbs 140 steps to the top to call the faithful to prayer.

===Hünkar Mosque (''Geamia Hunchiar''){{anchor|Hünkar Mosque}}===

Completed in 1869, the [[Hünkar Mosque, Constanța|Hünkar Mosque]] was commissioned by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] for Turks who were forced to leave [[Crimea]] after the [[Crimean War]] (1853–56) and settled in Constanța. It was restored in 1945 and 1992.

===Fantasio Theatre (''Teatrul Fantasio'')===

Originally called the Tranulis Theater after its benefactor, this theater was built in 1927 by Demostene Tranulis, a local philanthropist of Greek origin. A fine building featuring elements of neoclassical architecture, it's in the heart of the new city on Ferdinand Boulevard.

===Romanian Navy Museum (''Muzeul marinei române'')===

The largest institution of its kind in Romania, this museum showcases the development of the country's military and civil navy. The idea for the museum was outlined in 1919, but it only opened on 3 August 1969 during the regime of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]]. The collections include models of ships, knots, anchors and navy uniforms. It has also a special collection dedicated to figures who were important to the history of the Romanian navy. 

===Natural Sciences Museum Complex (''Complexul Muzeal de Științe ale Naturii'')===

The zoo-like complex consists of a dolphinarium, exotic birds exhibition, and a micro-Delta. There's a planetarium next door.

==Climate==
[[File:Mamaia Beach (September 2013).JPG|thumb|Mamaia, view towards Constanța]]
Constanța has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' in [[Köppen climate classification]]). 
Summer (early June to mid September) is hot and sunny, with a July and August average of {{convert|23|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Most summer days see a gentle breeze refreshing the daytime temperatures. Nights are warm and somewhat muggy because of the heat stored by the sea.

Autumn starts in mid or late September with warm and sunny days. September can be warmer than June, owing to the warmth accumulated by the Black Sea during the summer. The first frost occurs on average in mid November.

Winter is milder than other cities in southern Romania. Snow is not abundant but the weather can be very windy and unpleasant. Winter arrives much later than inland and December weather is often mild with high temperatures reaching {{convert|8|°C|0|abbr=on}} – {{convert|12|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The average January temperature is {{convert|1|°C|0|abbr=on}}. Winter storms, which occur when the sea becomes particularly treacherous, are a common occurrence between December and March.

Spring arrives early but it is quite cool. Often in April and May the Black Sea coast is one of the coolest places in Romania found at an altitude lower than {{convert|500|m|0|abbr=on}}.

Four of the warmest seven years from 1889 to 2008 have occurred after the year 2000 (2000, 2001, 2007 and 2008). As of September 2009, the winter and the summer of 2007 were respectively the warmest and the second warmest in recorded history with monthly averages for January (+6.5&nbsp;°C) and June (+23.0&nbsp;°C) breaking all-time records. Overall, 2007 was the warmest year since 1889 when weather recording began.

As of 1878, Constanța was defined as a "poor Turkish [[fishing]] village." As of 1920, it was called "flourishing", and was known for exporting [[oil]] and [[cereal]]s.<ref name=Stoica1>{{cite book|last=Stoica|first=Vasile|title=The Roumanian Question: The Roumanians and their Lands|year=1919|publisher=Pittsburgh Printing Company|location=Pittsburgh|page=77|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/77/|access-date=2013-10-09|archive-date=2014-03-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140303183345/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/7314/view/1/77/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Constanța is one of Romania's main industrial, commercial and tourist centers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ghidulturistic.ro/zone.php?j=13|title=GhidTuristic.Ro: ''Județul Constanța''|access-date=2 December 2008|language=ro|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090211125639/http://www.ghidulturistic.ro/zone.php?j=13|archive-date=11 February 2009}}</ref> During the first half of 2008, some 3,144 new companies were established in Constanța and its neighbouring localities, a number surpassed only in Bucharest and Cluj County.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cugetliber.ro/1218661200/articol/24287/constanta-are-3144-de-firme-noi-in-primele-sase-luni-din-2008/|title=Cuget Liber: ''Constanța are 3.144 de firme noi, în primele șase luni din 2008''|date=14 August 2008 |access-date=2 December 2008|language=ro|archive-date=28 September 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928111804/http://www.cugetliber.ro/1218661200/articol/24287/constanta-are-3144-de-firme-noi-in-primele-sase-luni-din-2008/|url-status=live}}</ref> The Port of Constanța is the largest on the Black Sea and the fourth largest in Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eosnap.com/snapshots/port-of-constanta-romania-on-the-black-sea/ |title=Port of Constanța Ranking |publisher=www.eosnap.com |date=2010-10-19 |access-date=2010-10-19 |archive-date=2012-03-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306070028/http://www.eosnap.com/snapshots/port-of-constanta-romania-on-the-black-sea/ }}</ref> The city also boasts a comparably large shipyard.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.snc.ro/index.php?page=about_us|title=Șantierul Naval Constanța: ''Despre noi''|access-date=2 December 2008|archive-date=22 September 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230922021047/http://www.snc.ro/index.php?page=about_us|url-status=live}}</ref>

Tourism has been an increasingly important economic activity in recent years. Although Constanța has been promoted as a seaside resort since the time of [[Carol I of Romania]], the development of naval industry has had a detrimental effect on the city's beaches.<ref>{{cite book|last=Juler|first=Caroline|title=Rumunia|series=Przewodniki ''National Geographic''|publisher=National Geographic Polska|language=pl}}</ref> However a massive rehabilitation of the beaches was undertaken in 2020 with EU funds that has resulted in new hectares of beach both in downtown Constanta and Mamaia.
Due to its proximity to other major tourist destinations, Constanța receives a significant number of visitors every year, who discover and visit the city's monuments and attractions, as well as the increasingly popular festival Neversea. Also, Constanța is a centre of commerce and education, both of which significantly contribute to the local economy.

==Transport==

[[File:A2-A4-02.jpg|thumb|[[A2 motorway (Romania)|A2 motorway]], also known as "Sun's Highway"]]
The opening, in 1895, of the railway to [[Bucharest]], which crosses the [[Danube River]] at the [[King Carol I Bridge|bridge]] at [[Cernavodă]], brought Constanța considerable transit trade in grain and petroleum, which are largely exported; coal and [[coke (fuel)|coke]] head the list of imports, followed by machinery, iron goods, cotton and woollen fabrics.<ref name="EB1911"/>

The [[A2 motorway (Romania)|A2 motorway]] provides a rapid road link between Constanța and Bucharest, while the [[A4 motorway (Romania)|A4 motorway]] acts as the city's outer traffic ring, diverting heavy traffic to and from the [[Port of Constanța]] and to [[Mangalia]].

[[File:Portul Turistic Tomis.jpg|thumb|Touristic port of Constanta]]
The [[Port of Constanța]] includes the North Port and the South Port, and is the fourth largest in Europe. It is protected by breakwaters, with a lighthouse at the entrance. The port is sheltered from the northerly winds, but southerly winds can prove dangerous at times. The Black Sea squadron of the [[Romanian Naval Forces|Romanian fleet]] is stationed here. A large canal (the [[Danube-Black Sea Canal]]) connects the Danube River to the Black Sea at Constanța.

The city is served by [[Mihail Kogălniceanu International Airport]].

[[File:Constanta pink bus.jpg|thumb|right|One of Constanța's distinctive pink [[Minsk Automobile Plant|MAZ]] buses, formerly running on Route 44]]
Constanța's public transport system is run by ''CT Bus'' (formerly ''Regia Autonomă de Transport în Comun Constanța'' - RATC), and consists of 19 year-round bus lines, and two seasonal lines, including a sightseeing [[Double-decker bus|double decker]] open top bus line.

In the early 2000s, the city bought 130 new [[Minsk Automobile Plant|MAZ]] buses to replace the aging fleet of [[DAC (vehicle manufacturer)|DAC]] buses. There is also a fleet of double decker [[Volvo]] buses that run in the summer, providing access to and from the resort of [[Mamaia]]. As of October 2013, the cost of a return ticket is 3 lei.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ratc.ro/|title=Regia Autonomă de Transport în Comun Constanța {{!}} Home|last=ILiNC|website=www.ratc.ro|access-date=2016-06-27|archive-date=2023-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230922021052/https://www.ctbus.ro/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Trams were active until the late 2000s when they were decommissioned in favour of long-wheelbase buses. Two trolley bus lines were active until the early 2010s – now also decommissioned and replaced by buses.

At the end of March 2014, all public buses were upgraded with Wi-Fi for free use by all passengers. Speeds fall into the 3G [[HSDPA]] mobile range. Also, as an upgrade to the ticketing system, since the same time, tickets and per day all bus lines subscriptions can be bought via SMS, accepted by all national operators.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digi24.ro/Stiri/Regional/Digi24+Constanta/Stiri/Internet+gratuit+in+autobuzele+RATC+Wireless+in+toate+mijloacele|title=Internet gratuit în autobuzele RATC.

In July 2018 Constanța municipality signed an €18 million-contract to acquire new buses manufactured by the Turkish company [[Anadolu Isuzu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://seenews.com/news/anadolu-isuzu-signs-18-mln-euro-bus-supply-deal-with-romanias-constanta-620010|title=Anadolu Isuzu signs 18 mln euro bus supply deal with Romania's Constanta|website=seenews.com|date=13 July 2018|access-date=14 December 2018|archive-date=15 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181215065823/https://seenews.com/news/anadolu-isuzu-signs-18-mln-euro-bus-supply-deal-with-romanias-constanta-620010|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2019 Constanta's new [[Mercedes-Benz]] minibusses entered service.

In October 2022 Constanta's new [[BYD Company|BYD]] electric buses entered service with CT Bus.

Constanța is one of the main focuses of the [[Rail-2-Sea]] project which aims to connect it to the Polish [[Baltic Sea]] port of [[Gdańsk]] with a {{convert|3,663|km|abbr=off}} long railway line passing through Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Poland.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://universul.net/rail-2-sea-and-via-carpathia-the-us-backed-highway-and-rail-links-from-the-baltic-to-the-black-sea/|title=Rail-2-Sea and Via Carpathia, the US-backed highway and rail links from the Baltic to the Black Sea|first=Alison|last=Mutler|newspaper=Universul.net|date=12 October 2020|access-date=13 July 2021|archive-date=10 November 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211110070034/https://universul.net/rail-2-sea-and-via-carpathia-the-us-backed-highway-and-rail-links-from-the-baltic-to-the-black-sea/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347344614|title=The Three Seas Initiative as a new model of regional cooperation in Central Europe: A Polish perspective|first=Łukasz|last=Lewkowicz|journal=UNISCI Journal|volume=18|pages=177–194|year=2020|issue=54|doi=10.31439/UNISCI-101|doi-access=free|access-date=2021-07-13|archive-date=2022-02-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220201032231/https://www.researchgate.net/publication/347344614_The_Three_Seas_Initiative_as_a_new_model_of_regional_cooperation_in_Central_Europe_A_Polish_perspective|url-status=live}}</ref>
