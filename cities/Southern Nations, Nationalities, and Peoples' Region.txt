The '''Southern Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples' Region''' (often abbreviated as '''SNNPR'''; {{lang-am|የደቡብ ብሔር ብሔረሰቦችና ሕዝቦች ክልል|Yädäbub Bḥer Bḥeräsäbočna Hzboč Kllə}}) was a [[Regions of Ethiopia|regional state]] in southwestern [[Ethiopia]]. It was formed from the merger of five ''kililoch'', called Regions 7 to 11, following the regional council elections on 21 June 1992.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Lyons |first=Terrence |date=1996 |title=Closing the Transition: The May 1995 Elections in Ethiopia |jstor=161741 |journal=Journal of Modern African Studies |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=135 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00055233 |s2cid=155079488}}</ref> Its government was based in [[Hawassa]].

The SNNPR bordered [[Kenya]] to the south (including a small part of [[Lake Turkana]]), the [[Ilemi Triangle]] (a region claimed by Kenya and [[South Sudan]]) to the southwest, Oromia region to the north and east. The capital city of the region was [[Hawassa]]. The region included major cities and towns like [[Wolaita Sodo]], [[Arba Minch]], [[Jinka]], [[Dila, Ethiopia|Dila]], [[Boditi]], [[Areka]], [[Butajira]], [[Welkite]], [[Bonga]], [[Hosaena]] and [[Worabe]].

The region dissolved when [[Sidama Region]], [[South West Ethiopia Peoples' Region|Southwest Ethiopia Region]], [[South Ethiopia Regional State]] and [[Central Ethiopia Regional State]] emerged independently.

In June 2020, following the formation of the [[Sidama Region]] the region's capital [[Hawassa]] is located outside of the boundaries of the region. The then  regional government planned to move to a city within the region's boundaries after two consecutive national electoral cycles.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=2019-10-18 |title=NEWS: SNNPRS Council approves legal framework which makes Hawassa city accountable to future Sidama Regional State |url=https://addisstandard.com/news-snnprs-council-approves-legal-framework-which-makes-hawassa-city-accountable-to-future-sidama-regional-state/ |url-status=live |access-date=2021-06-16 |website=Addis Standard |language=en-US |archive-date=2021-06-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210629083206/https://addisstandard.com/news-snnprs-council-approves-legal-framework-which-makes-hawassa-city-accountable-to-future-sidama-regional-state/ }}</ref> The largest cities in the region were [[Sodo]] with the population of 194,977 and [[Arba Minch]] with the population of 151,013.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021 |title=Population Projection Towns as of July 2021 |url=https://www.statsethiopia.gov.et/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Population-of-Towns-as-of-July-2021.pdf |access-date=31 May 2022 |website=Ethiopian Statistics Agency |archive-date=7 July 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220707171618/https://www.statsethiopia.gov.et/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Population-of-Towns-as-of-July-2021.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The dissolution of the region was certain when on 18 August 2023 the [[South Ethiopia Regional State]] was created following the [[2023 South Ethiopia Region referendum]] with remainder of the SNNPR becoming the [[Central Ethiopia Regional State]].

Based on the 2007 Census conducted by the [[Central Statistical Agency (Ethiopia)|Central Statistical Agency]] of Ethiopia (CSA), the SNNPR regional state had an estimated total population of 14,929,548, of whom 7,425,918 were men and 7,503,630 women. 13,433,991 or 89.98% of the population are estimated to be rural inhabitants, while 1,495,557 or 10.02% are urban; this makes the SNNPR Ethiopia's most rural region. With an estimated area of 105,887.18 square kilometers, this region has an estimated density of 141 people per square kilometer. For the entire region 3,110,995 households were counted, which results in an average for the region of 4.8 persons to a household, with urban households having on average 3.9 and rural households 4.9 people.<ref name=Census2007>Central Statistical Agency: [http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php/census-report/complete-report/census-2007?download=193:statistical-snnpr&start=10 ''The 2007 Population and Housing Census of Ethiopia: Statistical Report for Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples' Region; Part I: Population Size and Characteristics''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170406053325/http://www.csa.gov.et/index.php/census-report/complete-report/census-2007?download=193:statistical-snnpr&start=10 |date=2017-04-06 }}.

In the previous census, conducted in 1994, the region's population was reported to be 10,377,028 of whom 5,161,787 were men and 5,215,241 were women. At the time of the census, the rural population of the Region accounted for 93.2% of the total population. [[Semien Omo Zone|Semien Omo]], [[Wolayita Zone|Wolayita]], and [[Gurage Zone|Gurage]] were the three zones with the highest population. The population is concentrated mostly in eastern, northern and central part of the SNNPR while the western and southern part of the region is sparsely populated.

The SNNPR Water Resources Bureau announced that as of the fiscal year ending in 2006, they had increased the area of the region that had access to [[Water supply and sanitation in Ethiopia|drinkable water]] to 54% from 10 to 15% 15 years ago.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.waltainfo.com/EnNews/2006/Nov/28Nov06/21102.htm |title=Potable water expansion works underway with over 60mln birr in SNNP State |date=28 November 2006 |publisher=Walta Information Center |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007234513/http://www.waltainfo.com/EnNews/2006/Nov/28Nov06/21102.htm |archive-date=7 October 2007}}</ref> In August 2008, the head of public relations for the Bureau, Abdulkerim Nesru, announced that 94 million birr had been spent to further increase the availability of drinkable water in the region from 58% in the previous year to 63.6%. Priority was given to certain zones, such as Sidama, Welayta and Gurage, as well as the [[Alaba special woreda]] and several resettlement areas.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.waltainfo.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1917&Itemid=45 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525162748/http://www.waltainfo.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1917&Itemid=45 |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 May 2011 |title=SNNP State builds, repairs water facilities with over 94 mln birr |publisher=Walta Information Center |access-date=2 March 2009}}</ref>

Values for other reported common indicators of the [[standard of living]] for the SNNPR {{as of|2005|lc=on}} include the following: 10.7% of the inhabitants fall into the lowest wealth quintile; adult literacy for men is 57% and for women 22.4%; and the Regional [[infant mortality rate]] is 85 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, which is greater than the nationwide average of 77; at least half of these deaths occurred in the infants' first month of life.<ref>Macro International Inc.

===Languages===
The 2007 census reported that the predominantly spoken mother tongue languages include [[Sidama language|Sidama]] (19.59%), [[Welayta language|Welayta]] (10.48%), [[Hadiya language|Hadiya]] (8%), [[Gurage languages|Gurage]] (7.13%), [[Gamo language|Gamo]] (6.9%), [[Kafa language|Kafa]] (5.36%) and [[Amharic]] (4.10%). Other languages spoken in the State include [[Kambaata language|Kambaata]], [[Melo language|Melo]], [[Gofa language|Gofa]], [[Gedeo language|Gedeo]] and [[Dime language|Dime]]; because of the relatively few number of speakers of most of the languages in the region, the working language of the state is Amharic (the most widely spoken language in Ethiopia and formerly the only official language).<ref name=Census2007/>

The 1994 census reported that the predominantly spoken languages include [[Sidamo language|Sidamo]] (18%), [[Gurage languages|Gurage]] (14.72%), [[Welayta language|Welayta]] (11.53%), [[Hadiya language|Hadiya]] (8.53%), [[Kafa language|Kafa]] (5.22%), and [[Kambaata language|Kambaata]] (4.35%). Other languages spoken in the State include [[Gamo language|Gamo]], [[Melo language|Melo]], [[Gofa language|Gofa]], and [[Gedeo language|Gedeo]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ethiopar.net/type/English/basinfo/infosnnp.htm |title=FDRE States-Basic Information, Southern nations and Nationalities |access-date=10 May 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080618185251/http://www.ethiopar.net/type/English/basinfo/infosnnp.htm |archive-date=18 June 2008}}</ref>

[[Amharic]] is still the working language although most pupils get eight years of primary education in their home language and all secondary and further education is in English.<ref>Kathleen Heugh: {{Google books|x-jHBAAAQBAJ|Margins, Diversity and Achievement: System-Wide Data and Implementation of Multilingual Education in Ethiopia|page=48}}.
