Archeological evidence of spear points of both the Folsom and Clovis types indicate that the Ohio Valley was inhabited by [[Nomad|nomadic people]] as early as 13,000&nbsp;BC.<ref name="knepper9">Knepper (1989), p. 9.</ref> These early nomads disappeared from Ohio by 1,000&nbsp;BC.<ref name="knepper9" /> Between 1,000 and 800&nbsp;BC, the sedentary [[Adena culture]] emerged. The Adena established "semi-permanent" villages because they domesticated plants, including sunflowers, and "grew squash and possibly corn"; with hunting and gathering, this cultivation supported more settled, complex villages.<ref name="knepper10">Knepper (1989), p. 10.</ref> The most notable remnant of the Adena culture is the [[Great Serpent Mound]], located in [[Adams County, Ohio]].<ref name="knepper10" />

Around 100&nbsp;BC, the Adena evolved into the [[Hopewell tradition|Hopewell]] people, who were also mound builders. Their complex, large and technologically sophisticated [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] can be found in modern-day [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]], [[Newark, Ohio|Newark]], and [[Circleville, Ohio|Circleville]].<ref name="knepper11">Knepper (1989), p. 11.</ref> They were also a prolific trading society, their trading network spanning a third of the continent.<ref>Douglas T. Price; Gary M. Feinman (2008). Images of the Past, 5th edition. New York: McGraw-Hill. pp. 274–277.</ref> The Hopewell disappeared from the Ohio Valley about 600&nbsp;AD. The [[Mississippian culture]] rose as the Hopewell culture declined. Many Siouan-speaking peoples from the plains and east coast claim them as ancestors and say they lived throughout the Ohio region until approximately the 13th century.<ref name="knepper13">Knepper (1989), p. 13.</ref>

There were three other cultures contemporaneous with the Mississippians: the [[Fort Ancient]] people, the [[Whittlesey culture|Whittlesey Culture]]<ref name="knepper13" /> and the [[Monongahela Culture]].<ref>"Monongahela culture-AD 1050–1635". Fort Hill Archeology. Retrieved January 14, 2010.</ref> All three disappeared in the 17th century. Their origins are unknown. The Shawnees may have absorbed the Fort Ancient people.<ref name="knepper13" /> It is also possible that the Monongahela held no land in Ohio during the Colonial Era. The Mississippian culture was close to and traded extensively with the Fort Ancient people.

[[File:5NationsExpansion.jpg|thumb|left|[[Iroquois]] conquests during the [[Beaver Wars]] (mid-1600s), which largely depopulated the upper and mid-[[Ohio River]] valley.]]

Indians in the Ohio Valley were greatly affected by the aggressive tactics of the [[Iroquois Confederation]], based in central and western New York.<ref name="knepper14">Knepper (1989), p. 14.</ref> After the [[Beaver Wars]] in the mid-17th century, the Iroquois claimed much of the Ohio country as hunting and, more importantly, beaver-trapping ground. After the devastation of epidemics and war in the mid-17th century, which largely emptied the Ohio country of Indigenous people{{dubious|date=January 2019}} by the mid-to-late 17th century, the land gradually became repopulated by the mostly [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]. Many of these Ohio-country nations were multiethnic (sometimes multi-linguistic) societies born out of the earlier devastation brought about by disease,{{clarify|reason=no disease has been mentioned yet|date=January 2019}} war, and subsequent social instability. They subsisted on agriculture (corn, sunflowers, beans, etc.) supplemented by seasonal hunts. By the 18th century, they were part of a larger global economy brought about by European entry into the [[fur trade]].<ref name="roseboom20">Roseboom (1967), p. 20.</ref>

During the 18th century, the [[French colonisation of the Americas|French]] set up a system of [[trading post]]s to control the fur trade in the region. Beginning in 1754, the [[Kingdom of France]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] fought in the [[French and Indian War]], with various Native American tribes on each side.

===Northwest Territory===
{{Main|Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Territory}}
[[Image:Ohio Country en.png|thumb|left|The [[Ohio Country]] indicating battle sites between American settlers and Indigenous tribes, 1775–1794]]
The United States created the [[Northwest Territory]] under the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787.<ref name="cayton3">Cayton (2002), p. 3.</ref> [[Slave states and free states|Slavery was not permitted]] in the new territory. Settlement began with the founding of [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] by the [[Ohio Company of Associates]], which had been formed by a group of American Revolutionary War veterans. Following the Ohio Company, the [[Miami Purchase|Miami Company]] (also referred to as the "[[Symmes Purchase]]") claimed the southwestern section, and the [[Connecticut Land Company]] surveyed and settled the [[Connecticut Western Reserve]] in present-day [[Northeast Ohio]]. Territorial surveyors from Fort Steuben began surveying an area of eastern Ohio called the [[Seven Ranges]] at about the same time.

The old Northwest Territory originally included areas previously known as [[Ohio Country]] and [[Illinois Country]]. As Ohio prepared for statehood, the [[Indiana Territory]] was created, reducing the Northwest Territory to approximately the size of present-day Ohio plus the eastern half of the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan]] and the eastern tip of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]] and a sliver of southeastern Indiana called "The Gore".

The coalition of Native American tribes, known as the [[Western Confederacy]], was forced to cede extensive territory, including much of present-day Ohio, in the [[Treaty of Greenville]] in 1795.

Under the [[Northwest Ordinance]], areas could be defined and admitted as states once their population reached 60,000. Although Ohio's population was only 45,000 in December 1801, [[United States Congress|Congress]] determined that it was growing rapidly enough and accelerated the process via the [[Enabling Act of 1802]]. In regard to the [[Leni Lenape]] natives, Congress decided that 10,000 acres on the [[Muskingum River]] in the present state of Ohio would "be set apart and the property thereof be vested in the [[Moravian Brethren]]&nbsp;... or a society of the said Brethren for civilizing the Indians and promoting Christianity".<ref>{{cite web|title=Religion and the Congress of the Confederation, 1774–89|date=June 4, 1998|url=https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html|publisher=Library of Congress|access-date=April 11, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120502224644/http://www.loc.gov/exhibits/religion/rel04.html|archive-date=May 2, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Rufus Putnam, the "Father of Ohio"====
[[File:LandingOfThePioneers.jpg|thumb|The landing of [[Rufus Putnam]] and the first settlers at [[Marietta, Ohio]] in 1788.]]

[[Rufus Putnam]] served in important military capacities in both the [[French and Indian War]] and the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He was one of the most highly respected men in the early years of the United States.<ref>Hubbard, Robert Ernest.  ''General Rufus Putnam: George Washington's Chief Military Engineer and the "Father of Ohio,"'' pp. 1–4, McFarland & Company, Inc., Jefferson, North Carolina.  {{ISBN|978-1-4766-7862-7}}.</ref>

In 1776, Putnam created a method of building portable fortifications, which enabled the [[Continental Army]] to drive the British from Boston. [[George Washington]] was so impressed that he made Putnam his chief engineer. After the war, Putnam and [[Manasseh Cutler]] were instrumental in creating the [[Northwest Ordinance]], which opened up the [[Northwest Territory]] for settlement. This land was used to serve as compensation for what was owed to Revolutionary War veterans. Putnam organized and led the [[Ohio Company of Associates]], who settled at [[Marietta, Ohio]], where they built a large fort, [[Campus Martius (Ohio)|Campus Martius]].<ref>Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

In 1780, the directors of the Ohio Company appointed him superintendent of all its affairs relating to the settlement north of the Ohio River. In 1796, President George Washington commissioned him as Surveyor-General of United States Lands. In 1788, he served as a judge in the Northwest Territory's first court. In 1802, he served in the convention to form a constitution for the State of Ohio.<ref>Hubbard, Robert Ernest.

===Statehood and early years===
{{Main|Admission to the Union|List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union}}

On February 19, 1803, U.S. President [[Thomas Jefferson]] signed an act of Congress that approved Ohio's boundaries and constitution.<ref>An act to provide for the due execution of the laws of the United States, within the state of Ohio, ch. 7, {{USStat|2|201}} (February 19, 1803).</ref> But Congress had not passed a formal resolution admitting Ohio as the 17th state. Although no formal resolution of admission was required, when the oversight was discovered in 1953, as Ohio began preparations for celebrating its sesquicentennial, Ohio congressman [[George H. Bender]] introduced a bill in Congress to admit Ohio to the Union retroactive to March 1, 1803, the date on which the [[Ohio General Assembly]] first convened.<ref name="Blue" /> At a special session at the old state capital in [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]], the Ohio state legislature approved a new petition for statehood, which was delivered to [[Washington, D.C.]], on horseback, and approved that August.<ref name="Blue">{{cite journal |last=Blue |first=Frederick J. |title=The Date of Ohio Statehood |journal=Ohio Academy of History Newsletter |date=Autumn 2002 |url=http://www2.uakron.edu/OAH/newsletter/newsletter/Autumn2002/features.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100911164131/http://www2.uakron.edu/OAH/newsletter/newsletter/Autumn2002/features.html |archive-date=September 11, 2010}}</ref><ref>Joint Resolution for admitting the State of Ohio into the Union, ({{USStatute|83|204|67|407|1953|08|07}}).</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/slg/explanation-ohio-statehood.phtml|title=Clearing up the Confusion surrounding OHIO's Admission to Statehood|access-date=October 30, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091017120249/http://www.thegreenpapers.com/slg/explanation-ohio-statehood.phtml|archive-date=October 17, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>

Ohio has had three capital cities: Chillicothe, [[Zanesville, Ohio|Zanesville]], and [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]]. Chillicothe was the capital from 1803 to 1810. The capital was then moved to Zanesville for two years as part of a state legislative compromise to get a bill passed. The capital was then moved back to Chillicothe from 1812 to 1816. Finally, the capital was moved to Columbus, to be near the state's geographic center.

Although many Native Americans migrated west to evade American encroachment, others remained in the state, sometimes assimilating in part. Starting around 1809, the [[Shawnee]] pressed resistance to encroachment again. Under Chief [[Tecumseh]], [[Tecumseh's War]] officially began in Ohio in 1811. When the [[War of 1812]] began, the British decided to attack from [[Upper Canada]] into Ohio and merge their forces with the Shawnee. This continued until Tecumseh was killed at the [[Battle of the Thames]] in 1813. Most of the Shawnee, excluding the [[Pekowi]] in Southwest Ohio, were forcibly relocated west.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://schoolworkhelper.net/the-shawnee-tribe-war-of-1812/|title=The Shawnee Tribe & War of 1812|access-date=February 25, 2022|archive-date=February 25, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220225181201/https://schoolworkhelper.net/the-shawnee-tribe-war-of-1812/|url-status=live}}</ref> Ohio played a [[Ohio in the War of 1812|key role]] in the War of 1812, as it was on the front line in the Western theater and the scene of several notable battles both on land and in [[Lake Erie]]. On September 10, 1813, the [[Battle of Lake Erie]], one of the major battles, took place near [[Put-in-Bay, Ohio]]. The British eventually surrendered to [[Oliver Hazard Perry]].

Ultimately, after the U.S. government used the [[Indian Removal Act of 1830]] to force countless Native American tribes on the [[Trail of Tears]], where all the southern states except for [[Florida]] were successfully emptied of Native peoples, the government panicked because most tribes did not want to be forced out of their own lands. Fearing further wars between Native tribes and American settlers, they pushed all remaining Native tribes in the East to migrate west against their will, including all remaining tribes in Ohio.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Stockwell |first1=Mary |title=The Other Trail of Tears: The Removal of the Ohio Indians |date=2014}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/lanepl.org/columns-by-jim-blount/home/2017-articles/what-happened-to-indians-that-once-inhabited-ohio|title=What happened to Indians that once inhabited Ohio? - Columns by Jim Blount|access-date=February 25, 2022|archive-date=February 25, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220225181159/https://sites.google.com/a/lanepl.org/columns-by-jim-blount/home/2017-articles/what-happened-to-indians-that-once-inhabited-ohio|url-status=dead}}</ref>

In 1835, Ohio fought with the [[Michigan Territory]] in the [[Toledo War]], a mostly bloodless boundary war over the Toledo Strip. Only one person was injured in the conflict. Congress intervened, making [[Michigan]]'s admittance as a state conditional on ending the conflict. In exchange for giving up its claim to the Toledo Strip, Michigan was given the western two-thirds of the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper Peninsula]], in addition to the eastern third, which was already considered part of the territory.

===Civil War and industrialization===
[[File:Morganmap.jpg|thumb|The route of [[Morgan's Raid]] during the [[American Civil War]].]]

Ohio's central position and its population gave it an important place in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. The Ohio River was a vital artery for troop and supply movements, as were Ohio's railroads. Ohio's industry made it one of the most important states in the Union during the war. It contributed more soldiers per capita than any other state in the Union. In 1862, the state's morale was badly shaken in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Shiloh]], a costly victory in which Ohio forces suffered 2,000 casualties.<ref name="knepper233-234">Knepper (1989), pp. 233–234.</ref> Later that year, when [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] troops under the leadership of [[Stonewall Jackson]] threatened Washington, D.C., Ohio governor [[David Tod]] recruited 5,000 volunteers to provide three months of service.<ref name="roseboom188">Roseboom and Weisenburger (1967), p. 188.</ref> From July 13 to 26, 1863, towns along the Ohio River were attacked and ransacked in [[Morgan's Raid]], starting in [[Harrison, Ohio|Harrison]] in the west and culminating in the [[Battle of Salineville]] near [[West Point, Columbiana County, Ohio|West Point]] in the far east.

Artists, writers, musicians and actors developed in the state throughout the 20th century and often moved to other cities that were larger centers for their work. They included [[Zane Grey]], [[Milton Caniff]], [[George Bellows]], [[Art Tatum]], [[Roy Lichtenstein]], and [[Roy Rogers]]. [[Alan Freed]], who emerged from the swing dance culture in Cleveland, hosted the first live rock 'n roll concert in Cleveland in 1952. Famous filmmakers include [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Chris Columbus (filmmaker)|Chris Columbus]] and the original [[Warner Brothers]], who set up their first movie theatre in Youngstown before the company relocated to California. The state produced many popular musicians, including [[Dean Martin]], [[Doris Day]], [[The O'Jays]], [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Dave Grohl]], [[Devo]], [[Macy Gray]] and [[The Isley Brothers]].

Ohio's location has proven to be an asset for economic growth and expansion. Because it links the Northeast to the Midwest, much cargo and business traffic passes through its borders along its well-developed highways. Ohio has the nation's 10th-largest highway network and is within a one-day drive of 50% of North America's population and 70% of North America's manufacturing capacity.<ref>{{Cite web |archive-date=January 24, 2008 |url=http://www.dot.state.oh.us/budget/Feb12-03/TransDelivers2-12.asp |place=Ohio |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080124091721/http://www.dot.state.oh.us/budget/Feb12-03/TransDelivers2-12.asp |date=February 12, 2003 |title=Transportation delivers for Ohio |publisher=Department of Transportation |access-date=December 22, 2005}}</ref> To the north, Ohio has {{convert|312|mi|km}} of coastline with Lake Erie,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.ohiodnr.com/Home/about/counties/tabid/18020/Default.aspx |title=Ohio Coastal Counties |publisher=Department of Natural Resources |place=Ohio |access-date=September 3, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080830020758/http://ohiodnr.com/Home/about/counties/tabid/18020/Default.aspx |archive-date=August 30, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> which allows for numerous cargo ports such as Cleveland and Toledo. Ohio's southern border is defined by the [[Ohio River]]. Ohio's neighbors are [[Pennsylvania]] to the east, [[Michigan]] to the northwest, [[Lake Erie]] to the north, [[Indiana]] to the west, [[Kentucky]] on the south, and [[West Virginia]] on the southeast. Ohio's borders were defined by [[metes and bounds]] in the [[Enabling Act of 1802]] as follows:
{{blockquote |Bounded on the east by the Pennsylvania line, on the south by the Ohio River, to the mouth of the [[Great Miami River]], on the west by the line drawn due north from the mouth of the Great Miami aforesaid, and on the north by an east and west line drawn through the southerly extreme of [[Lake Michigan]], running east after intersecting the due north line aforesaid, from the mouth of the Great Miami until it shall intersect Lake Erie or the territorial line, and thence with the same through Lake Erie to the Pennsylvania line aforesaid.}}

Ohio is bounded by the Ohio River, but nearly all of the river belongs to Kentucky and West Virginia. In 1980, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] held that, based on the wording of the cessation of territory by [[Virginia]] (which at the time included what is now Kentucky and West Virginia), the boundary between Ohio and Kentucky (and, by implication, West Virginia) is the northern low-water mark of the river as it existed in 1792.<ref name="Ohio_v_Kentucky">{{Cite web | url = http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&vol=444&invol=335 | publisher = Find law | title = Ohio v.

Much of Ohio features [[Glacial till plains (Ohio)|glaciated till plains]], with an exceptionally flat area in the northwest being known as the [[Great Black Swamp]]. This glaciated region in the northwest and central state is bordered to the east and southeast first by a belt known as the [[glaciated Allegheny Plateau]], and then by another belt known as the [[unglaciated Allegheny Plateau]].

Rare and endangered species include the [[Hellbender|Eastern Hellbender]], which is found in the Southeastern Appalachian region of Ohio and is classified as state endangered.<ref>{{Cite web |title=EASTERN HELLBENDER |url=https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/animals/reptiles-amphibians/eastern-hellbender |access-date=2023-11-30 |website=Ohio Department of Natural Resources |archive-date=March 21, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230321061019/https://ohiodnr.gov/discover-and-learn/animals/reptiles-amphibians/eastern-hellbender |url-status=live }}</ref> The Eastern Hellbender is the 3rd largest [[amphibian]] in the world, and can grow up to 27 inches in length. It is fully aquatic and breathes almost entirely through its skin. Due to this, it is only found in pristine, cool, clear, fast flowing streams and rivers. It is highly threatened by [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]], [[Water pollution in the United States|water pollution]], and [[sedimentation]] due to logging and other human activities.<ref>{{Cite report |url=https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/59077/82473431 |title=Cryptobranchus alleganiensis: IUCN SSC Amphibian Specialist Group: The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species 2022: e.T59077A82473431 |last=IUCN |date=2021-07-15 |publisher=International Union for Conservation of Nature |doi=10.2305/iucn.uk.2022-2.rlts.t59077a82473431.en |access-date=30 November 2023 |language=en |doi-access=free |archive-date=January 20, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240120114609/https://www.iucnredlist.org/species/59077/82473431 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Climate===
{{See also|Climate change in Ohio}}
[[File:Köppen Climate Types Ohio.png|thumb|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Ohio, using 1991–2020 [[Climatological normal|climate normals]].]]
The climate of Ohio is a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dfa/Dfb'') throughout most of the state, except in the extreme southern counties of Ohio's [[Bluegrass region]] section, which are located on the northern periphery of the [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'') and [[Upland South]] region of the United States. Summers are typically hot and humid throughout the state, while winters generally range from cool to cold. Precipitation in Ohio is moderate year-round. Severe weather is not uncommon in the state, although there are typically fewer [[tornado]] reports in Ohio than in states located in what is known as the [[Tornado Alley]]. Severe [[lake effect snow]]storms are also not uncommon on the southeast shore of [[Lake Erie]], which is located in an area designated as the [[Snowbelt]].

Although predominantly not in a subtropical climate, some warmer-climate flora and fauna do reach well into Ohio. For instance, some trees with more southern ranges, such as the [[blackjack oak]], ''Quercus marilandica'', are found at their northernmost in Ohio just north of the Ohio River. Also evidencing this climatic transition from a subtropical to a continental climate, several plants such as the Southern magnolia ''([[Magnolia grandiflora]])'', [[Albizia julibrissin]] (mimosa), [[Crape Myrtle]], and even the occasional [[Needle Palm]] are hardy landscape materials regularly used as street, yard, and garden plantings in the [[Bluegrass region]] of Ohio; but these same plants will simply not thrive in much of the rest of the state. This interesting change may be observed while traveling through Ohio on [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|Interstate 75]] from [[Cincinnati]] to [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]]; the observant traveler of this diverse state may even catch a glimpse of Cincinnati's [[common wall lizard]], one of the few examples of permanent "subtropical" fauna in Ohio.

The worst weather disaster in Ohio history occurred along the Great Miami River in 1913. Known as the [[Great Dayton Flood]], the entire [[Great Miami River|Miami River]] watershed flooded, including the downtown business district of [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]]. As a result, the [[Miami Conservancy District]] was created as the first major floodplain engineering project in Ohio and the United States.<ref name="MCDAct">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiconservancy.org/about/conservancy.asp|title=The History of the MCD: The Conservancy Act|access-date=January 13, 2007|publisher=Miami Conservancy District|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070314003325/http://www.miamiconservancy.org/about/conservancy.asp|archive-date=March 14, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Ohio population map.png|thumb|Ohio population density map]]
There are 13 [[metropolitan statistical area]]s in Ohio, anchored by 16 cities, as defined by the U.S. [[Office of Management and Budget]]. Additionally, 30 Ohio cities function as centers of [[micropolitan statistical area]]s, urban clusters smaller than that of metropolitan areas. Ohio's three largest cities are [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], [[Cleveland]], and [[Cincinnati]].

Columbus is the capital of the state, near its geographic center, and is well known for [[Ohio State University]]<!--Wikipedians do not use "The" as part of Ohio State's name; it is considered a marketing gimmick, and routinely deleted.-->. In 2019, the city had six corporations named to the U.S. Fortune 500 list: [[Alliance Data]], [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company]], [[American Electric Power]], [[L Brands]], [[Huntington Bancshares]], and [[Cardinal Health]] in suburban [[Dublin, Ohio|Dublin]].<ref name="GDP">{{cite web |url=http://usmayors.org/metroeconomies/0110/charts.pdf |title=Top 100 U.S. metro economies |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100625175418/http://usmayors.org/metroeconomies/0110/charts.pdf |archive-date=June 25, 2010 |publisher=U.S. Conference of Mayors |access-date=April 22, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2019/06/10/alliance-data-systems-ohio.html |title=Plano set to lose Fortune 500 HQ as Alliance Data Systems shifts to Ohio |work=Dallas Business Journal |last=Womack |first=Brian |date=June 10, 2019 |access-date=August 19, 2021 |archive-date=November 25, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201125023459/https://www.bizjournals.com/dallas/news/2019/06/10/alliance-data-systems-ohio.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Other major employers include hospitals (among others, [[Wexner Medical Center]] and [[Nationwide Children's Hospital]]), high tech research and development including the [[Battelle Memorial Institute]], information-based companies such as [[OCLC]] and [[Chemical Abstracts Service]], manufacturer [[Worthington Industries]], and financial institutions such as [[JPMorgan Chase]] and [[Huntington Bancshares]]. Fast food chains [[Wendy's]] and [[White Castle (restaurant)|White Castle]] are also headquartered in Columbus.

Located in [[Northeast Ohio]] along the Lake Erie shore, Cleveland is characterized by its [[New England]] heritage, ethnic immigrant cultures, and history as a major American manufacturing and healthcare center. It anchors the Cleveland–Akron–Canton Combined Statistical Area, of which the industrial cities of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] and [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]] are constituent parts. [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]], [[Sandusky, Ohio|Sandusky]] and [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]] are also major cities in the region. Northeast Ohio is known for major industrial companies [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear Tire and Rubber]] and [[Timken Company|Timken]], top-ranked colleges [[Case Western Reserve University]], [[Oberlin College]], and [[Kent State University]], the [[Cleveland Clinic]], and cultural attractions including the [[Cleveland Museum of Art]], Big Five member [[Cleveland Orchestra]], [[Cuyahoga Valley National Park]], [[Playhouse Square]], the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]], and the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

[[Cincinnati, Ohio|Cincinnati]] anchors Southwest Ohio and the [[Cincinnati metropolitan area]], which also encompasses counties in Kentucky and Indiana. The metropolitan area is home to [[Miami University]] and the [[University of Cincinnati]], [[Cincinnati Union Terminal]], [[Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra]], and various Fortune 500 companies, including [[Procter & Gamble]], [[Kroger]], [[Macy's, Inc.]], and [[Fifth Third Bank]]. [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] and [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]] are in the Miami Valley, which is home to the [[University of Dayton]], the [[Dayton Ballet]], and the extensive [[Wright-Patterson Air Force Base]].

[[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] and [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]] are the major cities in Northwest Ohio, an area known for its glass-making industry. It is home to [[Owens Corning]] and [[Owens-Illinois]], two [[Fortune 500]] corporations.

[[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]] is the only metropolitan city in [[Appalachian Ohio]], a region known for its [[Appalachian mixed mesophytic forests|mixed mesophytic forests]]. Other metropolitan areas that contain cities in Ohio but are primarily in other states include the [[Huntington, West Virginia]] and [[Wheeling, West Virginia]] areas.

In order to be enacted into law, a bill must be adopted by both houses of the General Assembly and signed by the governor. If the governor vetoes a bill, the General Assembly can override the veto with a three-fifths supermajority of both houses. A bill will also become a law if the governor fails to sign or veto it within 10 days of its being presented.

==="Mother of presidents"===
Six U.S. presidents hailed from Ohio at the time of their elections, giving rise to its nickname "mother of presidents", a sobriquet it shares with [[Virginia]]. It is also termed "modern mother of presidents", in contrast to Virginia's status as the origin of presidents earlier in American history. Seven presidents were born in Ohio, making it second to Virginia's eight. Virginia-born [[William Henry Harrison]] lived most of his life in Ohio and is also buried there. Harrison conducted his political career while living on the family compound, founded by his father-in-law, [[John Cleves Symmes]], in [[North Bend, Ohio]]. The seven presidents born in Ohio were [[Ulysses S. Grant]] (elected from [[Illinois]]), [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], [[James A. Garfield]], [[Benjamin Harrison]] (grandson of William Henry Harrison & elected from [[Indiana]]), [[William McKinley]], [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Warren G. Harding]].<ref name="HEINRICHS">{{cite book|author=Ann Heinrichs|title=Ohio|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VTnyaU2WkmUC&pg=PT43|date=January 1, 2003|publisher=Capstone|isbn=978-0-7565-0316-1|page=42|access-date=June 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906030717/https://books.google.com/books?id=VTnyaU2WkmUC&pg=PT43|archive-date=September 6, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> All seven were [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republicans]].

=== Allegations of voter suppression ===
Since 1994, the state has had a policy of purging infrequent voters from its rolls. In April 2016, a lawsuit was filed, challenging this policy on the grounds that it violated the [[National Voter Registration Act of 1993|National Voter Registration Act (NVRA) of 1993]]<ref name="aclu-husted" /> and the [[Help America Vote Act of 2002]].<ref name="atlantic-husted">{{cite web |last1=Ford |first1=Matt |website=The Atlantic |date=May 30, 2017 |title=Use It or Lose It? |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/supreme-court-ohio-voting/528573/ |access-date=May 15, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190629004540/https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/supreme-court-ohio-voting/528573/ |archive-date=June 29, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> In June, the federal district court ruled for the plaintiffs and entered a preliminary injunction applicable only to the November 2016 election.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Ohio}}
Ohio's system of [[public education]] is outlined in Article VI of the [[Ohio Constitution|state constitution]], and in Title XXXIII of the [[Ohio Revised Code]]. [[Ohio University]], the first university in the [[Northwest Territory]], was also the first public institution in Ohio. Substantively, Ohio's system is similar to those found in [[Education in the United States|other states]]. At the State level, the Ohio Department of Education, which is overseen by the [[Ohio State Board of Education]], governs primary and secondary educational institutions. At the municipal level, there are approximately 700 school districts statewide. The [[Ohio Board of Regents]] coordinates and assists with Ohio's institutions of higher education which have recently been reorganized into the [[University System of Ohio]] under Governor Strickland. The system averages an annual enrollment of more than 400,000 students, making it one of the five largest state university systems in the U.S.

===Colleges and universities===

Ohio is home to several public and private institutions of higher learning. Prior to statehood, the [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 included a provision to establish an institution of higher education in the region, which resulted in the establishment of [[Ohio University]] in 1804 as Ohio's first college.<ref>See [[College Lands]]: Ohio University Chartered, and [[Land Ordinance of 1785]], and {{cite book|title = A compilation of laws, treaties, resolutions, and ordinances: of the general and state governments, which relate to lands in the state of Ohio; including the laws adopted by the governor and judges; the laws of the territorial legislature; and the laws of this state, to the years 1815–16 | publisher = G.

Ohio schools consistently ranking in the top 50 nationally of the ''[[U.S. News & World Report]]'' of liberal arts colleges include members of the “[[Five Colleges of Ohio]]”: [[Denison University]], [[Kenyon College]] and [[Oberlin College]]. Ranking in the top 100 of national research universities typically includes [[Case Western Reserve University]], [[Ohio State University]] and [[Miami University]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/oh |title=2019 Best Colleges in Ohio &#124; US News Rankings |access-date=February 24, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224120917/https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/oh |archive-date=February 24, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Ohio Public Library Information Network (OPLIN)]] is an organization that provides Ohio residents with internet access to their 251 public libraries. OPLIN also provides Ohioans with free home access to high-quality, subscription research databases.

Ohio also offers the [[OhioLINK]] program, allowing Ohio's libraries (particularly those from colleges and universities) access to materials for the other libraries. The program is largely successful in allowing researchers for access to books and other media that might not be otherwise available.

===Roads===
{{See also|List of Interstate Highways in Ohio|List of U.S. Routes in Ohio|List of state routes in Ohio}}
Many major east–west transportation corridors go through Ohio. One of those pioneer routes, known in the early 20th century as "Main Market Route 3", was chosen in 1913 to become part of the historic [[Lincoln Highway]] which was the first road across America, connecting New York City to San Francisco. In Ohio, the Lincoln Highway linked many towns and cities together, including [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], [[Mansfield, Ohio|Mansfield]], [[Wooster, Ohio|Wooster]], [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]], and [[Van Wert, Ohio|Van Wert]]. The Lincoln Highway's arrival in Ohio was a major influence on the state's development. Upon the advent of the federal numbered highway system in 1926, the Lincoln Highway through Ohio became [[U.S. Route 30 in Ohio|U.S. Route 30]].

Ohio is home to {{convert|228|mi|km|0}} of the [[National Road]], now [[U.S. Route 40 in Ohio|U.S. Route 40]].

Ohio has a highly developed network of roads and interstate highways. Major east-west through routes include the [[Ohio Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 80 in Ohio|I-80]]/[[Interstate 90 in Ohio|I-90]]) in the north, [[Interstate 76 in Ohio|I-76]] through [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]] to [[Pennsylvania]], [[Interstate 70 in Ohio|I-70]] through [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], and the [[Appalachian Highway (Ohio)|Appalachian Highway]] ([[Ohio State Route 32|State Route 32]]) running from [[West Virginia]] to [[Cincinnati]]. Major north–south routes include [[Interstate 75 in Ohio|I-75]] in the west through [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], Dayton, and Cincinnati, [[Interstate 71|I-71]] through the middle of the state from [[Cleveland]] through Columbus and Cincinnati into [[Kentucky]], and [[Interstate 77 in Ohio|I-77]] in the eastern part of the state from Cleveland through Akron, [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], [[New Philadelphia, Ohio|New Philadelphia]] and [[Marietta, Ohio|Marietta]] south into West Virginia. Interstate 75 between Cincinnati and Dayton is one of Ohio's most heavily traveled sections of interstate.

===Trails===
Ohio has a highly developed network of signed state bicycle routes. Many of them follow [[rail trail]]s, with conversion ongoing. The [[Ohio to Erie Trail]] (route 1) connects Cincinnati, Columbus, and Cleveland. [[U.S. Bicycle Route 50]] traverses Ohio from [[Steubenville, Ohio|Steubenville]] to the Indiana state line outside [[Richmond, Indiana|Richmond]].<ref name="USRN USBR 50">{{AASHTO minutes |year = 2014S |access-date = June 1, 2014}}</ref>

Ohio has several long-distance hiking trails, the most prominent of which is the [[Buckeye Trail]], which extends {{convert|1444|mi|adj=on|abbr=on}} in a loop around the state. Part of it is on roads and part on wooded trail. Additionally, the [[North Country Trail]] (the longest of the 11 [[National Scenic Trail]]s authorized by [[United States Congress|Congress]]) and the [[American Discovery Trail]] (a system of recreational trails and roads that collectively form a coast-to-coast route across the mid-tier of the [[United States]]) pass through Ohio. Much of these two trails coincide with the Buckeye Trail.

===Rail===
{{Ohio rail network}}
{{See also|List of Ohio railroads|List of Ohio train stations}}
Ohio has an extensive rail network, though today most lines carry only freight traffic. Three [[Class I railroads|Class I]] freight railroads operate in Ohio: [[CSX Transportation]], [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], and [[Canadian National Railway]]. Many local freight carriers also exist in the state.

[[Amtrak]], the national passenger railroad, operates three long-distance rail routes through Ohio. The ''[[Lake Shore Limited]]'' serves {{amtk|Cleveland}}, {{amtk|Elyria}}, {{amtk|Toledo}}, {{amtk|Sandusky}}, and {{amtk|Bryan}}. The ''[[Capitol Limited]]'' stops in those cities as well as in {{amtk|Alliance}}. The ''[[Cardinal (train)|Cardinal]]'' serves [[Cincinnati Union Terminal]]. From Ohio, passengers can ride directly to {{amtk|Chicago}}, {{amtk|New York}}, [[South Station|Boston]], {{amtk|Washington, D.C.}}, {{amtk|Indianapolis}}, {{amtk|Pittsburgh}}, {{amtk|Buffalo}}, and dozens of destinations in-between.

Columbus is the largest city in the U.S. with no passenger rail. Its [[Union Station (Columbus, Ohio)|Union Station]] was last served in 1979 by the ''[[National Limited (Amtrak train)|National Limited]].''

Ohio is home to several [[Heritage railway|scenic railways]] and museums, including the [[Cuyahoga Valley Scenic Railroad]] through [[Cuyahoga Valley National Park]], the [[Age of Steam Roundhouse]] museum, and the [[Hocking Valley Scenic Railway]] near [[Hocking Hills State Park]].

===Transit===
[[File:Cincinnati-bell-connector station-1-the-banks 09-11-2016.jpg|thumb|Cincinnati [[Connector (Cincinnati)|Connector]] [[tram|streetcar]]]]
Mass transit exists in many forms in Ohio cities, primarily through bus systems. The [[Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority]] (GCRTA) operates the [[RTA Rapid Transit]] system, which consists of one heavy rail line, three [[Light rail in the United States|light rail]] lines, and three [[bus rapid transit]] lines. Cincinnati is served by the [[Southwest Ohio Regional Transit Authority]] (SORTA) bus network as well as a {{convert|3.6|mi|adj=on}} [[streetcar]] line, the [[Cincinnati Bell Connector]]. Other major transit agencies in Ohio include the [[Central Ohio Transit Authority]] (COTA) serving Columbus and the [[Greater Dayton Regional Transit Authority]] (GDRTA) serving Dayton.

===Air travel===
{{See also|List of airports in Ohio}}
Ohio has four international airports, four commercial, and two military. The four international include [[Cleveland Hopkins International Airport]], [[John Glenn Columbus International Airport]], [[Dayton International Airport]], and [[Rickenbacker International Airport]] (one of two military airfields). The other military airfield is [[Wright Patterson Air Force Base]] which is one of the largest Air Force bases in the United States. Other major airports are in [[Toledo Express Airport|Toledo]] and [[Akron-Canton Airport|Akron]]. Cincinnati's main airport, [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport]], is in [[Hebron, Kentucky]], and therefore is not included in Ohio airport lists.
