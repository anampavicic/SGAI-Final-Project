From 1929 to 1936, the city, then known as Alma-Ata, was the capital of the [[Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic|Kazakh ASSR]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=70 YEARS TO BE THE MAIN |url=https://e-history.kz/en/news/show/7005 |access-date=2023-06-07 |website=e-history.kz |date=24 March 2017 |language=en |archive-date=7 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230607025531/https://e-history.kz/en/news/show/7005 |url-status=live }}</ref> From 1936 to 1991, Alma-Ata was the capital of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]]. After Kazakhstan became independent in 1991, the city was renamed Almaty in 1993 and continued as the capital until 1997, when the capital was moved to Akmola (renamed Astana in 1998, Nur-Sultan in 2019, and again [[Astana]] in 2022). Since then Almaty has been referred to as the "southern capital" of Kazakhstan.

Almaty remains the largest, most developed, and most ethnically and culturally diverse city in [[Kazakhstan]]. Due to development by the Soviet Union and relocation of workers and industries from European areas of the Soviet Union during [[World War II]], the city has a high proportion of [[Russians|ethnic Russians]] and [[Uyghurs]]. The city lies in the foothills of [[Trans-Ili Alatau]] (or Zailiysky Alatau) in the extreme south-east.

It has a relatively mild climate with warm and dry summers and quite cold winters.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Almaty Climate, Weather By Month, Average Temperature (Kazakhstan) - Weather Spark |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/108859/Average-Weather-in-Almaty-Kazakhstan-Year-Round |access-date=2023-06-07 |website=weatherspark.com |language=en |archive-date=7 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230607025530/https://weatherspark.com/y/108859/Average-Weather-in-Almaty-Kazakhstan-Year-Round |url-status=live }}</ref> Since the city is in a tectonically active area, it has an endemic risk of [[earthquake]]s. Although most tremors do not cause any significant damage, Almaty has suffered some large destructive earthquakes.

==Etymology==
The name ''Almaty'' has its roots in the medieval settlement ''Almatau'', that existed near the present-day city. A disputed theory holds that the name is derived from the [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]] word for 'apple' (алма), and is often translated as "full of apples".
Originally it was Almatau which means Apple Mountain.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pasha |first=Muhammad Ali |date=2022-08-18 |title=Kazakhstan - Motherland of Apples |url=https://thegulfobserver.com/kazakhstan809/ |access-date=2023-05-11 |website=The Gulf Observer |language=en-US |archive-date=11 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230511064855/https://thegulfobserver.com/kazakhstan809/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://weproject.kz/en/articles/detail/history-and-meaning-of-the-city-names-in-kazakhstan/ |title=History and meaning of the city names in Kazakhstan – статьи, истории, публикации {{!}} WEproject |website=weproject.kz |language=ru |access-date=2017-09-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925132634/http://weproject.kz/en/articles/detail/history-and-meaning-of-the-city-names-in-kazakhstan/ |archive-date=25 September 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

There is great [[genetic diversity]] among the wild apples in the region surrounding Almaty; the region west of the [[Tian Shan]] mountains is thought to be the apple's ancestral home. The wild ''[[Malus sieversii]]'' is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/2961/ |last=Nabhan |first=Gary Paul |title=The Fatherland of Apples |date=May–June 2008 |work=Orion Magazine |access-date=4 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140923222708/http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/2961/ |archive-date=23 September 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>

{{refimprove section|date=July 2024}}
{{see also|Timeline of Almaty}}

===Prehistoric Almaty===
During 1000–900 BC in the [[Bronze Age]], the first farmers and cattle-breeders established settlements in the territory of Almaty.<ref name="history" /> During the [[Saka]] period (from 700 BC to the beginning of the Christian era), these lands were occupied by the Saka and later [[Wusun]] tribes, who inhabited the territory north of the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range with evidence of these times found in the numerous burial mounds ([[Tumulus|tumuli]]) and ancient settlements, especially the giant burial mounds of the Saka tsars. The most famous archaeological finds have been "The Golden Man", also known as "The Golden Warrior", from the [[Issyk Kurgan]]; the Zhalauly treasure, the [[Kargaly]] diadem, and the [[Jetisu|Zhetysu]] arts bronzes (boilers, lamps, and altars). During the period of Saka and Wusun governance, Almaty became an early education center.<ref name="history">{{cite web |url=http://www.almaty.kz/page.php?page_id=384&lang=2 |title=History of Almaty |publisher=Almaty.kz |access-date=2 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119190828/http://www.almaty.kz/page.php?page_id=384&lang=2 |archive-date=19 January 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===15th–18th centuries===
In the 15th–18th centuries, the city was in decline as trade activities were decreasing on this part of the [[Silk Road]]. European nations were conducting more overseas trade by shipping. This period was one of crucial ethnic and political transformations.

The [[Dzungar people|Dzungar]] invaded, dominating the Kazakh people for a period. The Kazakhs fought to protect their land and preserve independence. In 1730 the Kazakh defeated the Dzungar in the Anyrakay mountains, {{convert|70|km|mi|round=5|abbr=off}} northwest of Almaty. The Senior Kazakh Horde (Uly Zhuz) held jurisdiction over the region. During the eighteenth century, the city and region were roughly near the border of the [[Khanate of Kokand]]. It was then absorbed as part of the Russian Empire in the 1850s.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

===Foundation of Verny===

To establish its control of the region, Russia built '''Fort Zailiyskoe''' ({{langx|ru|Заилийское}}) between the Bolshaya and Malenkaya Almatinka rivers. Construction began on 4 February 1854 and was largely completed by autumn. The fort was a pentagonal wooden palisade with one side built along the Malaya Almatinka. Before the end of the year, it was renamed '''Fort Vernoe''' ({{lang|ru|Верное}}, "Loyal"), sometimes rendered as Vyernoe at the time.<ref>{{citation |last= |first= |location= |publisher= |date=1881 |volume=XII |edition=9th |title=[[:s:EB9|Encyclopaedia Britannica]] |contribution=[[:s:Encyclopædia Britannica, Ninth Edition/Ili|Ili]] }}.</ref> The palisade was eventually replaced with a brick wall with embrasures. The fort's main facilities were erected around the large central square for training and parading.<ref>[http://lyakhov.kz/semirek/studies/150chron.shtml Archived copy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108013547/http://lyakhov.kz/semirek/studies/150chron.shtml |date=8 January 2009}}</ref>

In 1867, the settlement around the fort was large enough that it was reorganized as the town of '''Almatinsk''' ({{lang|ru|Алматинск}}). Before the end of the year, this was renamed '''Verny''' ({{lang|ru|Верный}}, {{translit|ru|Vernyj}}).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://almaty.gov.kz/page.php?page_id=384&lang=2&wptouch_preview_theme=enabled |title=History of Almaty |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170925180853/http://almaty.gov.kz/page.php?page_id=384&lang=2&wptouch_preview_theme=enabled |archive-date=25 September 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref>

On 28 May 1887, at 4 a.m., an [[1887 Verny earthquake|earthquake]] almost totally destroyed Verny in 11–12 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kazakhstan.orexca.com/almaty_history.shtml |title=History of Almaty :: Echoes of Past Centuries.

By 1906 the population of the city had grown to 27,000, two-thirds of whom were Russians and Ukrainians.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

On 3 January 1911 the city was almost completely destroyed with over 770 brick buildings collapsing as a result of the [[1911 Kebin earthquake]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Today in Earthquake History |url=https://earthquake.usgs.gov/learn/today/index.php?month=1&day=3&submit=View+Date |website=earthquake.usgs.gov |access-date=3 January 2024}}</ref>

[[File:Opera in Almaty.JPG|thumb|227x227px|The Almaty Opera Building]]In 1918 following the Russian Revolution and the establishment of the Bolshevik government, [[Soviet (council)|Soviet]] power was established in Verny.

In 1926, the Council of Labor and Defence approved the construction of the [[Turkestan–Siberia Railway]] that was a crucial element of the future growth of Kazakhstan, especially in the east and southeast of the region. The Turkestan–Siberia Railway construction also had a decisive economic impact that strongly influenced the destiny of Alma-Ata as the capital of the [[Kazakh ASSR]]. In 1930 the construction of the highway and railway to Alma-Ata was completed.<ref name=":0" />

On 29 April 1927, the government decided to transfer the capital of the [[Kazakh Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] from [[Kyzyl-Orda]] to Alma-Ata, within the RFSFR.<ref name=":0" /> This attracted more trade and people working with the government, stimulating intensive development in the city.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

On 31 January 1928, [[Leon Trotsky]], leader of the 1917 [[October Revolution]], accompanied by his wife [[Natalia Sedova]] and his son [[Lev Sedov]], was exiled to Alma-Ata by [[Joseph Stalin]], then head of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)]] in Moscow. Trotsky was expelled from Alma-Ata to Turkey in February 1929, and went into exile in Mexico City.

The Alma-Ata airport was opened in 1930,<ref>{{Cite web |title=История авиации Алматы.Теги: обсуждение истории развития; изучение биографии авиаторов; история авиации. |url=http://aviaengeneer.ru/istoriya-aviatcii-almaty |access-date=2022-03-09 |website=aviaengeneer.ru |language=ru-RU |archive-date=4 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704043821/http://aviaengeneer.ru/istoriya-aviatcii-almaty |url-status=live }}</ref> opening up a direct connection from Alma-Ata to [[Moscow]], the center of the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]]. Alma-Ata became the main entry by air to [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]], a status which it retains today. Transformation of this small town into the capital of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]] was accelerated by the large-scale construction of new administrative and government facilities and housing. The [[Great Purge]] of 1936–38 extended to [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakhstan]], where numerous intellectuals, activists, leaders, teachers and others were killed. [[Government of the Soviet Union|The Soviet government]] dominated the population. During the [[1930s]] [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] nomads suffered [[Kazakh famine of 1931–1933|starvation]] after disruption of their traditional living patterns. (see: [[Kazakh famine of 1931–1933|Asharshylyq]])

In [[1936]] the Architecture and Planning Bureau developed a plan to enhance Alma-Ata as the new cultural capital of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh SSR]]. The plan was based on the existing rectangular system of districts. They were to be strengthened and reconstructed.

====World War II====
During [[World War II]] the government dramatically affected the city's population and structures. To better organize the home front and concentrate industrial and material resources, the government evacuated 26,000 people and numerous industries from the European theatre of war.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Эвакуация населения и промышленности из западныз районов СССР в Северо-Казахстанскую область (1941-1943 гг.) |url=https://e-history.kz/ru/history-of-kazakhstan/show/9274/ |access-date=2022-03-09 |website=e-history.kz |date=10 October 2013 |language=ru |archive-date=12 April 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220412083759/https://e-history.kz/ru/history-of-kazakhstan/show/9274/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Alma-Ata hosted over 30 industrial facilities removed from the European section of [[Soviet Union|the USSR]], eight evacuated hospitals, 15 institutes, universities and technical schools; and around 20 cultural institutions.

====Industrialization ====
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2012}}

During the years 1941–1945 the industrial potential of the city increased significantly. Development increased during the postwar years. The population of the city grew from 104,000 in 1919 to 365,000 in 1968. By 1967 the city had 145 enterprises, with the bulk of these being light and food industries.

The main industries in Alma-Ata were: food processing (36% of gross industrial output), based largely on locally abundant fruit and vegetable raw materials, light industry (31%), and heavy industry (33%). The main products of the region were:
* '''Food:''' Meat, flour and cereals (pasta factory), milk, [[wine]]s, canned fruit, tobacco, confectionery, alcoholic spirits, [[beer]], yeast, and tea (packaging)
* '''Light industry:''' textiles, fur, knitting, [[carpet]]s, footwear, apparel, printing, and the Almaty Cotton combine.
* '''Heavy industry:''' electrical engineering, foundry engineering, car repair, bearing repair, building materials, woodworking, concrete structures and structural elements, and housebuilding.

From 1966 to 1971, 1,400,000 square metres of [[Public housing|public]] and [[Housing cooperative|cooperative housing]] were built. Annually, around 300,000 square metres of dwellings were under construction. Most of the buildings constructed during this time were [[Seismic analysis|earthquake-proof]] multi-story buildings. The Soviet government tried to diversify architectural forms to create a more varied cityscape. During this period, many schools, hospitals, cultural, and entertainment facilities were constructed, including Lenin's Palace, the [[Hotel Kazakhstan|Kazakhstan Hotel]], and the [[Medeo]] Sports Complex.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Спортивный комплекс Медеу в Алматы |url=http://alnaz.ru/almaty/medeu.html |access-date=2022-03-09 |website=alnaz.ru |archive-date=30 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220330110124/http://alnaz.ru/almaty/medeu.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The supersonic transport [[Tupolev]] [[Tu-144]] went into service on 26 December 1975, carrying mail and freight between Moscow and Alma-Ata in preparation for passenger services; these began in November 1977. The Aeroflot flight on 1 June 1978 was the 55th and last scheduled passenger flight of the Tu-144.

Alma-Ata was the host city for a 1978 international conference on [[Primary Health Care]]. The [[Alma Ata Declaration]] was adopted, marking a paradigm shift in global public health.

On 16 December 1986, the [[Jeltoqsan]] riot took place in the [[Republic Square, Almaty|Brezhnev Square]] (now Republic Square) in response to General Secretary [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s dismissal of [[Dinmukhamed Kunayev]].<ref>"Nationalist riots in Kazakhstan: Violent nationalist riots erupted in Alma-Ata, the capital of Kazakhstan, on 17 and 18 December 1986"</ref>

On 7 September 1988, the subway [[Almaty Metro]] project started construction; the subway was opened on 1 December 2011 after 23 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zakon.kz/site_main_news/4460872-v-almaty-otkrylsja-metropoliten.html |title=В Алматы открылся Метрополитен (фото) |date=December 2011 |publisher=Zakon.kz |access-date=2015-06-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132616/http://www.zakon.kz/site_main_news/4460872-v-almaty-otkrylsja-metropoliten.html |archive-date=2 April 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Post-independence===
Kazakhstan declared its independence from the Soviet Union on 16 December 1991 ([[Kazakhstan Independence Day]]). On 28 January 1993, the government renamed the city from the Russian ''Alma-Ata'' to the Kazakh name ''Almaty''.<ref name="gov.kz-hist">{{cite web |url=https://almaty.gov.kz/page.php?page_id=384&lang=2 |title=History of Almaty |access-date=2018-04-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406225820/https://almaty.gov.kz/page.php?page_id=384&lang=2 |archive-date=6 April 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1997 the President of the Republic of Kazakhstan [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] approved the decree to transfer the capital from Almaty to Astana in the north of the country.<ref>[http://www.akorda.kz/www/www_akorda_kz.nsf/sections?OpenForm&id_doc=80696F88AC705680462572340019E5CD&lang=en Archived copy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071126184729/http://www.akorda.kz/www/www_akorda_kz.nsf/sections?OpenForm&id_doc=80696F88AC705680462572340019E5CD&lang=en |date=26 November 2007}}</ref> 

On 1 July 1998 a law was passed to establish the special status of Almaty as a scientific, cultural, historical, financial, and industrial centre.<ref name="gov.kz-hist" />

The new general plan of Almaty for 2030 was released in 1998. It is intended to create ecologically safe, secure, and socially comfortable living conditions in the city. The main objective is to promote Almaty's image as a garden-city.

It proposes continued multi-storied and single-housing development, reorganization of industrial districts or territories, improving transport infrastructure, and expanding the [[Almaty Metro]]. The first line of the Almaty metro was launched on 1 December 2011, two weeks ahead of schedule. The extension of the line to Qalqaman was opened in 2015.

Nevertheless, Almaty has developed a major problem with [[air pollution]]. Already in 1995, [[particulate emissions]], then mostly from the city's [[thermal power station]], exceeded Kazakh and EU standards by over 20 times.<ref>{{cite report |title=Almaty Air Quality Study (TA 2262-Kaz) |author=CRE Group |year=1995 |page=i |publisher=[[Asian Development Bank]] |access-date=2018-01-22 |url=https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/72714/28427-kaz-tacr.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072342/https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-document/72714/28427-kaz-tacr.pdf |archive-date=22 January 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In 2008, Almaty was ranked the 9th most polluted city in the world.<ref name="mercerairpollution">{{cite news |title=Almaty is one of ten most polluted cities in the world |publisher=Kazakhstan Today |date=2008-03-05 |access-date=2018-01-22 |url=http://www.kt.kz/eng/ecology/almaty_is_one_of_ten_most_polluted_cities_in_the_world_1153441869.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180122072549/http://www.kt.kz/eng/ecology/almaty_is_one_of_ten_most_polluted_cities_in_the_world_1153441869.html |archive-date=22 January 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> A 2013 study identified cars as a major source of pollution, and it was noted since 2003 and 2013 [[morbidity]] had increased by a factor of 1.5, and that the city takes the first place in the republic on respiratory, endocrine and blood diseases, cancer and [[bronchial asthma]], even though there are no major industrial installations.<ref name="pollutionstudy2013">{{cite journal |last1=Carlsen |first1=Lars |last2=Baimatova |first2=Nassiba |last3=Kenessov |first3=Bulat |last4=Kenessova |first4=Olga |title=Assessment of the Air Quality of Almaty.

The area of the city has been expanded during recent years with the annexation of the suburban settlements of Kalkaman, Kok Tobe, [[Gorniy Gigant District]] (Mountain Giant). Numerous apartment blocks and office [[skyscraper]]s have transformed the face of the town, which has been built into the mountains.

Almaty was the site of [[2016 shooting of Almaty police officers|a notorious terrorist attack]] in July 2016, when [[Jihadism|Jihadist]] Ruslan Kulikbayev killed eight police officers and two civilians in a shootout and car chase. Kulikbayev was wounded during the shootout and later sentenced to death for the attack.

== Geography ==
Almaty is located in south-eastern Kazakhstan, almost 1000&nbsp;km from the capital Astana. Kyrgyzstan's capital [[Bishkek]] is 190&nbsp;km to the west, while [[Ürümqi]] in China is almost 1000&nbsp;km east.

The region is also home to the [[Mynzhylky mountain plateau|Mynjylky mountain plateau]], an elevated plain located at the source of the Malaya Almaatinka river at an altitude of 3000 meters above sea level.

=== Climate ===
Almaty has a [[Humid continental climate#Hot/warm summer subtype|humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Dfa'') with hot summers and cold winters. It is characterized by the influence of [[Mountain breeze and valley breeze|mountain&ndash;valley circulation]]. This is especially evident in the northern part of the city, located directly in the transition zone of the mountain slopes to the plains.

Annual average air temperature is equal to {{convert|10|°C|0|abbr=on}}, the coldest month is January, {{convert|-4.7|°C|0|abbr=on}} (on average), the warmest month (July) {{convert|23.8|°C|0|abbr=on}} (on average). In average years frost starts on about 14 October and ends on about 18 April, with sustained extreme cold from about 19 December to about 23 February, a period of about 67 days. Weather with temperature above {{convert|30|°C|0|abbr=on}} is average for about 36 days a year. In the center of Almaty, like any large city, there is a [[heat island]]. Therefore, frost in the city center starts about 7 days later and finishes 3 days earlier than in the northern suburbs. Annual precipitation is about {{convert|650|to|700|mm|1|abbr=on}}. April and May are the wettest months, during which about a third of the city's annual precipitation is received.

It is not uncommon to see snow or a cold snap hitting Almaty as late as the end of May. For example, in the last quarter century, such snowfalls were recorded on 13 May 1985, 1 May 1989, 5 May 1993 and 18 May 1998. The record latest snowfall in Almaty was on 17 June 1987.

Almaty sometimes experiences winter rain, despite heavy preceding snowfall and low temperatures. The most memorable winter rain took place on 16 December 1996 during a military parade to celebrate the 5th anniversary of the Independence of the Republic.

Almaty Weather Station's GM mostly records south-easterly wind (30%), its resistance increases during the summer (37%) and falls in winter (19%). Wind speeds exceed 15&nbsp;m/s on about 15 days a year, on average.

===Seismic activity in the territory of Kazakhstan===
{{more citations needed section|date=December 2013}}
Industrially developed and densely populated areas in the south and southeast of Kazakhstan are situated in the zones where the maximum magnitudes of expected earthquakes are from 6.0 to 8.3 (the intensity of I0=8–10).

The south seismic active zone of Kazakhstan is a part of the North Tian-Shan ridge system. The main city of Almaty is located near the Zailiski Alatau mountain base. In recorded history prior to the late 19th century, three catastrophic earthquakes are known to have taken place there. The following are the dates of occurrence and extracts from the historical chronicles of the times:

* 1770, "...Belovodka village was buried";
* 1807, "a horrible catastrophe took place in Almaty";
* 1865, strong earthquake.

Within the past 125 years, three more strong destructive earthquakes occurred here, with centres not more than {{convert|20-130|km|mi|round=5}} from the current city location. Their magnitudes were 9 and 11 on the MSK scale – 64, and their centres were located within {{convert|100|km|mi|round=5}}. Centres were located in a south and south–east directions:
* (1887 y., K=17.14) Vernenskoe
* (1889 y., K=19.12) Chilik
* (1911 y., K=18.76) Keminskoe

K – indicates the energy of the earthquake.

In each of these earthquakes, the city suffered wide destruction.<ref>(Baimakhan, Dashdorj, 2006)</ref>

The Territory of the Kyrgyz State adjoins North Tian-Shan.<ref>(Aitmatov, Kojogulov, Nikolskaya, 1994.).</ref>

=== Theaters ===
[[File:Abai Theatre.jpg|thumb|273x273px|[[Abay Opera House]]]]
Theatrical art began to develop in the city of Verny a few years after the construction of the Russian fort. On 21 November 1872, the Society of Dramatic Art Lovers staged the first production in the city: [[Alexander Ostrovsky|A. N. Ostrovsky]]'s play, "[[Stay in Your Own Sled]]". Later, plays were performed at public, military, and commercial gatherings. An abridgement of [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]]'s opera "A Life for the Tsar" was the first opera staged in the city, by the Kolpakovsky three-year city school on 23 February 1913 at the Commercial Assembly, to commemorate the [[Romanov Tercentenary|tercentenary of the Romanov dynasty]].

The flowering of theatrical art in the city began during the Soviet period of Alma-Ata, resulting from the transfer of the capital of the [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic]] from [[Kyzylorda]] to Alma-Ata. Thus, the Kazakh Drama Theater, the first Kazakh professional theater, moved to the city. In the 1930s, the Opera and Ballet Theater (1934) and the Puppet Theater (1935) were established in the city. Also, theater companies founded in different cities of the republic began to move to the capital: the [[Lermontov Russian Drama Theatre|Russian Drama Theater]] (moved from [[Semipalatinsk]] in 1934), the Uyghur Musical Comedy Theater (from Chilik, 1962), the [[Korean Theatre of Kazakhstan|Korean Musical Comedy Theater]] (from Kyzylorda, 1968), and the German Drama Theater (from Temirtau, 1989).

After Kazakhstan regained independence in 1991, a large number of new independent theaters appeared in the city. Often these are modern youth concert venues created by enthusiasts. They face funding problems, as maintaining a permanent theater company is costly.

=== Museums ===
[[File:Museum of Folk Instruments, Almaty.jpg|left|thumb|246x246px|[[Kazakh Museum of Folk Musical Instruments]]]]
A significant contribution to the study of the history of culture, ethnography of southern Kazakhs in the late 19th–20th centuries was made by Turkestan scientists and local historians, united around the scientific societies and cultural and educational institutions of [[Tashkent]]. In 1874, from the private collections of travelers who visited Semirechye with a scientific and regional purpose and with the help of the local intelligentsia, a museum was first created in the city of Verny, which was later transformed into a village museum of the Semirechye Cossack Host. This date is the day of the foundation of the first museum in Semirechye. The foundation of the A. Kasteev Museum of Arts was laid by the Kazakh State Art Gallery named after T.G. Shevchenko, founded in 1935. Its main tasks were to collect the best works of Kazakh artists and organize their creative business trips.

[[File:Central State Museum of the Republic of Kazakhstan.jpg|thumb|246x246px|[[Central State Museum of Kazakhstan]]]]
In 1936, museums in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] (now St. Petersburg) donated a significant number of paintings, graphics, sculpture and applied art to the gallery. By the end of the 1950s, the gallery's funds numbered over 5,000 exhibits, including paintings, reproductions of works by pre-revolutionary and Soviet artists, Western European and Eastern masters of art. In the 1970s and 1980s, new buildings were built for existing museums, and new thematic museums were opened: books, musical instruments, archeology, and others. A significant contribution to the development of the museum business was the opening of the Museum of the History of Almaty, which created an association of museums in the city of Almaty and the state institution "Gylym Ordasy", which united 4 museums, which allows to systematize scientific work.

=== Cinemas ===
The first film screening in the city of Verny took place in 1900, when the physicist K.O. Krause arrived in the city. On it, hand-painted glass transparencies were demonstrated with the help of an overhead projector. The film show took place on 25 January in the Pushkin Garden. In January 1911, the building of the first private cinema "Twentieth Century" was opened at the intersection of Pushkin and Gogol streets, which belonged to the entrepreneur A. R. Seifullin. For the demonstration of films, the cinema was equipped with the first power plant in the history of the city, produced by the British company "Petter", with 14 horsepower. The cinema building burned down in February 1918. Starting in the 1930s, summer cinemas began to appear in the parks of the city, which were later transformed into full-fledged cinemas. Thus, the Rodina Cinema was first opened in the [[Central Park (Almaty)|Central Park]] in 1937. In 1957, it was rebuilt from a seasonal venue into a wide-screen cinema with an auditorium for 712 seats. In another park of the city, the Park of the Federation of Soviet Republics, the Progress Cinema was opened, later renamed Alma-Ata. By the early 1990s, there were 21 cinemas in the city. All cinemas were divided into first, second and third screens. The cinemas of the first screen, in which the premieres of new films took place, were "Alatau", "Tselinny" and "Arman". Film films arrived at the cinemas of the third screen in a deplorable state, with glues and cuts. That is, the quality of showing the film depended on the screening of the cinema. Cinemas in the city were single-screen, two halls were owned by the cinema centers "Kazakhstan", "Arman" and "Tselinny". In the 2000s, cinemas began to open in shopping and entertainment centers, and as a result, existing stationary cinemas began to lose popularity and close.

==Economy==
[[File:Almaty from hill (cropped).jpg|thumb|270px|View of Almaty from Kök-Töbe]]
Almaty generates approximately 20% of Kazakhstan's GDP (or $36 billion in 2010). The city accounts for about 20% of government revenues and 60% of bank credits.<ref>{{cite web |title=President: Almaty turns into large regional investment attractive centre |url=https://www.inform.kz/en/president-almaty-turns-into-large-regional-investment-attractive-centre_a3579997 |website=inform.kz |date=29 October 2019 |access-date=31 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191030195947/https://www.inform.kz/en/president-almaty-turns-into-large-regional-investment-attractive-centre_a3579997 |archive-date=30 October 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref> The nation is the most powerful economically in [[Central Asia]] and Almaty is a key financial center.

One of the largest industries in Almaty is finance, and its financial exports make it a large contributor to Kazakhstan's balance of payments. Almaty is home to [[Halyk Bank]], which is the largest bank in Central Asia, [[Kaspi Bank]], and other major banks. The [[Kazakhstan Stock Exchange]] is based in Almaty.

Almaty is also developing as a regional financial and business centre (RFCA).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalbank.kz/?docid=768&switch=english |title=National Bank of Kazakhstan |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727101051/http://www.nationalbank.kz/?docid=768&switch=english |archive-date=27 July 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Under construction is the 'Almaty Financial District and Esentai Park'. This was designed by [[T.J. Gottesdiener]], who designed both [[7 World Trade Center]] in New York City and [[Tokyo Midtown]]. Its goal is to become the largest business centre in Central Asia. {{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Esentai Tower, a 37-floor building in the park, is the tallest mixed-use building in Kazakhstan, housing offices of companies such as [[Ernst & Young]], [[HSBC]] and [[Credit Suisse]]. The first Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Kazakhstan opened in 2013 in Esentai Tower.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ritz-Carlton Plans Kazakhstan Debut by End of 2013 |url=http://www.satrapia.com/news/article/ritz-carlton-plans-kazakhstan-debut-by-end-of-2013/ |newspaper=The Gazette of Central Asia |date=4 December 2012 |publisher=Satrapia |access-date=5 December 2012 |archive-date=9 January 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220109150934/http://gca.satrapia.com/+ritz-carlton-plans-kazakhstan-debut-by-end-of-2013+ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Along with professional services, media companies are concentrated in Almaty. The media distribution industry has been growing rapidly since 2006. Major broadcasting channels KTK and NTK are based in Almaty, as are several national newspapers.

There are plans to construct a Western Europe-Western China highway, passing through Almaty. A new airport in Almaty expects to handle about 45 million tonnes of cargo each year.

In 1854, the Tsarist government built a military fortification on the left bank of the Almaty River. The construction was supervised by Major Peremyshelsky and engineer-lieutenant Aleksandrovsky. By the autumn of the same year, construction work was completed. With their arrival, the area of Almaty began to develop rapidly, and a few prominent buildings were constructed during this time including the Little Stanitsa and the Tatar Slobodka. A major earthquake in 1887 destroyed 1798 brick houses and killed 322 people. After the earthquake, numerous notable buildings were constructed including the House of the Regiment of Military Assembly (1908), [[Ascension Cathedral, Almaty|Ascension Cathedral]], the House of Public Assembly, and others. Paul Gourdet, who is credited for most of Almaty's urban architecture of the time, used an approach to design [[Russian Revival architecture]], which is evident in some of his designs including the Medical College, the Voznesensky Cathedral, the merchant Shakhvorostov's house, the former Women's College, the former City Orphanage, and numerous other buildings. Andrei Zenkov is another prominent architect and major contributor to some of Almaty's most notable buildings. At the time, Zenkov was in charge of the construction projects of the Semirechye regional government.

From 1966 to 1972, most of the buildings constructed during the era were earthquake-proof multi-story housing blocks. During this period, many schools, hospitals, cultural, and entertainment facilities were constructed in [[Postmodernism|post-modernist]] style, including Lenin's Palace (now [[Palace of the Republic, Almaty|Palace of the Republic]], 1970), [[Hotel Kazakhstan]] (1977) and the [[Medeu]] (1971).

=== Attractions ===
====Churches====
[[File:Ascention Cathedral in Almaty.jpg|thumb|224x224px|Ascension Cathedral in Almaty]]
* [[St. Sophia Cathedral (Almaty)]]
* The [[Ascension Cathedral, Almaty|Ascension Cathedral]] is a 56 m high earthquake-resistant structure, built by the architect K. A. Borisoglebsky and engineer A. P. Zenkov in 1907 from blue Tien Shan [[spruce]]. It withstood an earthquake with a force of 10 points in 1911. The walls of the cathedral were painted by the local artist N. Khludov. During the Soviet period, the building housed a local history museum. In May 1995, the building was transferred to the [[Almaty and Semipalatinsk Diocese]] of the Russian Orthodox Church. After two years of restoration work, services were resumed in the church in 1997.

====Fountains====
According to the city's Department of Natural Resources and Resource Use Management,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.almatyeco.kz/1311 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20070521220106/http://www.almatyeco.kz/1311 |url-status=dead |title=Заголовок :: Новости :: Департамент экологии Акимата г. Алматы – экол… |date=21 May 2007 |archive-date=21 May 2007 |access-date=23 October 2017}}</ref> {{As of|2007|lc=y}} the city had 125 fountains. Among them is the "Oriental Calendar" Fountain, whose 12 sculptural figures represent the 12 animals of the Kazakh 12-year animal cycle (similar to [[Earthly Branches|its Chinese counterpart]]).

There are now more than 120 fountains in Almaty, 61 of which are communally owned. Fountains, together with an extensive irrigation ditch network, play a big role in Alma-Ata – together they create a single complex of reservoirs and watercourses of the city. Every year at the end of spring, the city celebrates the "Day of Fountains" holiday where for the first time after winter, all the city's fountains are turned on. In 2006, a new fountain was opened on [[Sayram Lake|Lake Sayran]]. Previously, the highest fountain in the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) gushed from this lake – a stream of water 10&nbsp;cm in diameter reached a height of 50 meters. The fountain has been closed since 2008.<gallery widths="140" heights="110">

=== Recreation ===

==== Medeu ====
[[File:Medeo.jpg|thumb|Medeu]]
The [[Medeu]] is an outdoor [[speed skating]] and [[bandy]] rink. It is located in a mountain valley (Medeu Valley, or the valley of Malaya Alma-Atinka River) on the south-eastern outskirts of Almaty, [[Kazakhstan]]. Medeu sits 1,691 metres above sea level, making it one of the highest skating rinks in the world. It has 10,500 square meters of ice and utilizes a sophisticated freezing and watering system to ensure the quality of the ice.
