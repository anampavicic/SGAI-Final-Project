'''Khujand'''{{efn|{{langx|tg|Хуҷанд}}; {{langx|ru|Худжанд}}; {{langx|uz|Хўжанд|Хo'jand}}; {{langx|fa|خجند‌|Khojand}}}}, sometimes spelled '''Khodjent''' and formerly known as '''Leninabad'''{{efn|{{langx|ru|Ленинабад|Leninabad}}; {{langx|tg|Ленинобод|Leninobod}}; {{langx|fa|لنین‌آباد‌|Leninâbâd}}}} from 1936 to 1991, is the second-largest city of [[Tajikistan]] and the capital of Tajikistan's northernmost [[Sughd]] province.

Khujand is one of the oldest cities in [[Central Asia]], dating back about 2,500 years to the [[Persian Empire]]. Situated on the [[Syr Darya|Syr Darya river]] at the mouth of the [[Fergana Valley]], Khujand was a major city along the ancient [[Silk Road]]. After being captured by [[Alexander the Great]] in 329 BC, it was renamed [[Alexandria Eschate]] and has since been part of various empires in history, including the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] (8th century), the [[Mongol Empire]] (13th century) and the [[Russian Empire|Russian empire]] (19th century).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Abdullaev |first1=Kamoludin |title=Historical Dictionary of Tajikistan |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1-5381-0252-7 |page=241 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OsllDwAAQBAJ |chapter=Khujand}}</ref>  Today, the majority of its population are ethnic [[Tajiks]] and the city is close to the present borders of both [[Uzbekistan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].

==History==

[[File:Historical Musuem of Sughd.jpg|thumb|[[Historical Museum of Sughd]]]]

=== Antiquity ===
Khujand may have been the site of [[Cyropolis]] ({{lang|grc|Κυρούπολις}}) which was established when king [[Cyrus the Great]] founded the city during his last expedition against the Saka tribe of [[Massagetae]] shortly before his death. [[Alexander the Great]] later built his furthest [[Greeks|Greek]] settlement near Cyropolis in 329 BC and named it [[Alexandria Eschate]] ([[Greek language|Greek]]: Ἀλεξάνδρεια Ἐσχάτη) or "Alexandria The Furthest".<ref>Prevas, John. (2004). ''Envy of the Gods: Alexander the Great's Ill-Fated Journey across Asia'', p. 121. Da Capo Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts {{ISBN|0-306-81268-1}}.</ref> The city would form a bastion for the Greek settlers against the nomadic [[Scythia]]n tribes who lived north of the [[Syr Darya]] River. According to the Roman writer [[Quintus Curtius Rufus|Curtius]], ''Alexandria Ultima'' (Alexandria the Furthest) retained its [[Hellenistic culture]] as late as 30 BC. The city became a major staging point on the northern [[Silk Road]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanistan.com/tajikistan/north/khujand/|title=Khujand: a travel guide|website=Caravanistan|language=en-US|access-date=2019-12-08}}</ref> It also became a cultural hub and several famous poets and scientists came from this city.

The Sheik Muslihiddin Mausoleum and Jami Masjidi Yami mosque, together with the fortress of Khujand, which was built over 2,500 years ago together and underwent several stages of complete destruction and renovation, were preserved by Khujand, as were some monuments from the 16th-17th century.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Khujand|url=https://samarkandtours.com/tajikistan/khujand/|access-date=March 24, 2021}}</ref>

=== Post-classical ===
In the early eighth century AD, Khujand was captured by the forces of the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], under [[Qutayba ibn Muslim]]. The city was incorporated into the Umayyad and subsequent [[Abbasid Caliphate]]s, and a process of [[Islamicization]] began. In the late ninth century, however, it reverted to local rule and was incorporated into the [[Samanid Empire]]. It came under the rule of the [[Kara-Khanid Khanate]] in 999 and after the division of Kara Khanids in 1042, it was initially part of Eastern Kara Khanids, and then later passed to the western one. Molana Wajeeh-ud-Din Khujandi was a Muslim scholar of Khujand who migrated to Dilli. Hafiz Khawaja Sheikh Mehmood (Moena Doz) was his nephew. His daughter Bibi Qursam Khatoon was mother Of Baba Fareed ud Din Ganj e Shakr.

[[Kara-Khitan Khanate|Karakhitans]] conquered it in 1137, but it passed to [[Khwarazmian dynasty|Khwarazmshahs]] in 1211. In 1220, it strongly resisted the [[Mongol Empire|Mongol hordes]] and was thus laid to waste. In the 14th century, the city was part of the [[Chagatai Khanate]] until it was incorporated into the [[Timurid dynasty]]' in the late 14th century, under which it flourished greatly. The [[Shaybanids|Shaybanid]] dynasty of [[Bukhara]] next annexed Khojand, until it was taken over by the [[Kokand Khanate]] in 1802, however, Bukhara regained it in 1842 until it was lost a few decades later to Russia.

=== Russian Empire ===
In 1866, as most of  Central Asia was occupied by [[Russian Empire]], the city became part of the General [[Governorate]] of [[Turkestan]], under [[Tsarist]] Russia. The threat of forced conscription during [[World War I]] led to protests in the city in July 1916, which turned violent when demonstrators attacked Russian soldiers.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+tj0013%29 A Country Study: Tajikistan, Tajikistan under Russian Rule, Library of Congress Call Number DK851 .K34 1997]</ref>

=== Soviet Union ===
During the initial period of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] power in Central Asia, Khujand was part of the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan ASSR]] that was created in 1918. When the latter was dismantled in 1924 on the principle of [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union|national delimitation]], the city became a part of the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic]]. In 1929, the previously created [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] (contained within the Uzbek SSR) was upgraded to union-level republic as the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic]], and in order to gain a sufficient number of inhabitants (preferably from the titular ethnic group) the city of Khujand and the surrounding area, inhabited mainly by ethnic [[Tajiks]], was transferred by Soviets from the Uzbek SSR to the Tajik SSR.

The city was renamed Leninobad on 10 January 1936<ref name="fezsughd.tj"/> and it remained part of the Soviet Union until 1991.
[[File:Мечеть и голуби 1.JPG|thumb|Sheikh Muslihiddin Mosque and Mausoleum]]
Now a part of the Tajik SSR, Leninobad became the second-largest city in the republic, though the city's location within the historically more urban, prosperous, and commercially central Fergana Valley and a long history of being a densely populated urban centre meant that Khujand and its region were sometimes viewed as more developed and cosmopolitan than the newly designated capital and boom-town of Dushanbe/Stalinabad (the latter was a small town of 6,000 when the Tajik SSR was created in 1926 and had reached over 200,000 inhabitants ten years later).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kalinovsky, Artemy M.|title=Laboratory of socialist development: Cold War politics and decolonization in Soviet Tajikistan|date=15 May 2018|isbn=978-1-5017-1558-7|location=Ithaca|pages=116|oclc=1013988565}}</ref>

=== Post-Soviet period and independence ===
It reverted to its original name in 1992 after the breakup of the Soviet Union and the independence of Tajikistan, and the city continued to be the second-largest city in the nation.

In 1996 the city experienced the [[Khujand prison riot#Ashurov protests|Ashurov protests]] during which citizens called for the President, [[Emomali Rakhmonov]] to step down. The popular protests were followed by a protest from the city's prisoners, many of whom had been sentenced to long jail terms for minor crimes and who were living in poor conditions. The protest led to the [[Khujand prison riot]] in which between 24 and 150 prisoners were killed.

In the early 2000s many residents of Khujand had little to no access to water, and what water they did have was unsafe to drink and had to be boiled. In 2004, The Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs and the [[European Bank of Reconstruction and Development]] joined to help improve the situation, providing 32,000 water meters for inhabitants and developing improved access to water. Residents pay for their water supply, which in turn helps Khujand's municipal water company to continue to renovate and improve their services. The project is in its third stage of development and was to be completed by 2017. In comparison to other Central Asian projects aiming to improve access to water, this project is considered a success and has been applied to Kyrgyz cities and towns such as [[Osh]], [[Jalal-Abad]], [[Karabalta]], and [[Talas, Kyrgyzstan|Talas]], with a possible extension into the Kyrgyz capital of [[Bishkek]].<ref>International Crisis Group.

Retrieved 7 October 2014.</ref>

On 3 September 2010, a suicide attack was committed in the city by the al-Qaeda linked Jamaat Ansarullah militant group, resulting in the deaths of 4 people.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pannier |first=Bruce |date=13 May 2022 |title=Northern Afghanistan and the New Threat to Central Asia |url=https://www.fpri.org/article/2022/05/northern-afghanistan-and-the-new-threat-to-central-asia/ |access-date=2022-05-15 |website=Foreign Policy Research Institute |language=en-US |quote=Jamaat Ansarullah, for instance, is a terrorist group from Tajikistan that claimed responsibility for a suicide bomber attack in the northern Tajik city of Khujand in September 2010 that killed four people.[7] The Tajik government launched a crackdown on suspected Jamaat Ansarullah members and since then the group has been operating alongside the Taliban in northern Afghanistan.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Zenn |first1=Jacob |last2=Kuehnast |first2=Kathleen |date=October 2014 |title=Preventing Violent Extremism in Kyrgyzstan |url=https://www.usip.org/sites/default/files/SR355_Preventing-Violent-Extremism-in-Kyrgyzstan.pdf |access-date=15 May 2022 |website=United States Institute of Peace |quote=Jamaat Ansarullah first carried out an attack in 2010, when it claimed responsibility for an al-Qaeda-trained member’s suicide bombing at a police station in Khujand, a city in Tajikistan’s northern province of Sughd in the Fergana Valley.}}</ref>

In April 2017, Pastor Bakhrom Kholmatov was detained after a raid on Sunmin Sunbogym Protestant Church in Khujand. Kholmatov was accused of singing too loudly and "interfering with the comfort and rest" of people who lived nearby, and jailed for three years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prisoneralert.com/pprofiles/vp_prisoner_261_profile.html|title=Prisoner Alert - Bakhrom Kholmatov|website=www.prisoneralert.com}}</ref>{{better source needed|date=October 2023}}

==Transportation==
[[File:Khujand (LBD - UTDL) AN2218848.jpg|thumb|left|Khujand airport terminal]]
[[Khujand Airport]] has regularly scheduled flights to [[Dushanbe International Airport|Dushanbe]] as well as several cities in Russia. There is also a rail connection between Khujand and [[Samarkand]] in [[Uzbekistan]] on the way to [[Dushanbe]].<ref>http://www.caravanistan.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/central-asia-railroad-train-map-kazakhstan-uzbekistan-kyrgyzstan-tajikistan-turkmenistan-afghanistan.gif {{Bare URL image|date=March 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanistan.com/transport/train/tajikistan/|title=Train in Tajikistan|website=Caravanistan|date=28 February 2023 }}</ref> The city is connected by road to [[Panjakent]] in the [[Zeravshan River|Zeravshan River Valley]] as well as [[Dushanbe]] via the [[Anzob Tunnel]].

The 5-km tunnel, located 80&nbsp;km northwest of [[Dushanbe]] and built with assistance from Iran, is also a transit route between [[Dushanbe]] and the [[Uzbekistan|Uzbek]] capital of [[Tashkent]]. Previously, particularly during cold seasons, the lack of a direct link between northern and southern [[Tajikistan]] often led to disruptions of commercial activities in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.shine.cn/article/article_xinhua.aspx?id=260205|title=Tajikistan to complete construction of major tunnel in 2015 &#124; Shanghai Daily|website=archive.shine.cn|access-date=2020-08-13|archive-date=2021-03-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210305225701/https://archive.shine.cn/article/article_xinhua.aspx?id=260205|url-status=dead}}</ref>
