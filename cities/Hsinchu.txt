'''Hsinchu''' ({{efn native lang|tw|name=word1}} {{zh|t=新竹|p=Xīnzhú}}<!--Chinese in infobox-->) is a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|city]] located in northwestern [[Taiwan]]. It is the most populous city in Taiwan that is not a [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]], with estimated 450,655 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ris.gov.tw/app/portal/346|title=中華民國 內政部戶政司 全球資訊網|last=中華民國內政部戶政司|date=1 May 2018|website=中華民國內政部戶政司|access-date=29 April 2020}}</ref> Hsinchu is a coastal city bordering the [[Taiwan Strait]] to the west, [[Hsinchu County]] to the north and east, and [[Miaoli County]] to the south. Hsinchu is nicknamed the ''Windy City'' for its strong northeastern [[monsoon]] during the autumn and winter seasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hccg.gov.tw/en/home.jsp?id=24&parentpath=0|title=Natural climate|date=22 January 2016 |agency=[[Hsinchu City Government]]|access-date=4 November 2022 }}</ref>

The area was originally settled by the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] [[Taiwanese indigenous peoples]], with the settlement being named "Tek-kham" by the [[Hoklo]] immigrants. The city was founded by [[Han Chinese]] settlers in 1711, and renamed "Hsinchu" in 1878. During [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], the city was named "Shinchiku" and was the seat of [[Shinchiku Prefecture]]. The prefecture encompassed present-day Hsinchu City and County, as well as entire [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]] and Miaoli. After the ROC rule in 1945, the urban area of Hsinchu was organized as a [[provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city]].

In 1980, the Taiwanese government established the [[Hsinchu Science Park]], an industrial centre for [[Semiconductor device fabrication|semiconductor manufacturing]]. The headquarters of [[TSMC]], a semiconductor foundry, [[MediaTek]] and [[United Microelectronics Corporation]], are all located in the park.<ref>{{cite news |title=TSMC tops list of corporate taxpayers with NT$55bn |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2022/07/15/2003781769 |access-date=1 July 2024 |work=Taipei Times |date=July 15, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Wang |first1=Lisa |title=MediaTek profit up on higher demand |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2024/02/01/2003812902 |access-date=1 July 2024 |work=Taipei Times |date=February 1, 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Wang |first1=Lisa |title=UMC net profit falls 30.8% on slow demand |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/biz/archives/2024/02/01/2003812904 |access-date=1 July 2024 |work=Taipei Times |date=February 1, 2024}}</ref>

Besides its industry, Hsinchu is a cultural center of Taiwan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?post=157728&unit=20,35&unitname=Taiwan-Review&postname=Culturally-Connected|title=Taiwan Review-Culturally Connected|author= Kelly Her|website=[[Taiwan Today]]|date= 1 July 2019|access-date=3 March 2023}}</ref> The [[Chenghuang Temple of Hsinchu]], built in 1747, is a common prayer destination. The research institutions of [[National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University]] and [[National Tsing Hua University]] are both located near the science park.

==Etymology==
''Hsin-chu'' is the [[Wade-Giles]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] of the [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] pronunciation of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name {{nowrap|{{lang|zh|{{linktext|新竹}}}}}}. The same name is rendered ''Xīnzhú'' in [[Hanyu Pinyin]] and ''Sinjhú'' in [[Tongyong Pinyin]].

==History==
{{main|History of Hsinchu}}

===Early settlement===
The area around Hsinchu City was inhabited by the [[Taokas people|Taokas]] aborigines{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Hsinchu |url=https://www.traveltill.com/destination/Taiwan/Hsinchu/history.php?page=1 |access-date=June 9, 2022 |website=TravelTill}}</ref> when the [[Spanish Formosa|Spanish occupied northern Taiwan]] in the 17th century. [[Roman Catholicism on Taiwan|Catholic missionaries]] reached the settlement of Tek-kham in 1626. The Spanish were expelled by [[Dutch Formosa|the Dutch]] a few decades later.

===Qing Dynasty===
[[Taiwan under Qing rule|Under the Qing]], a Chinese town was established at Tek-kham by {{ill|Wang Shih-chieh (settler)|lt=Wang Shih-chieh|zh|王世傑 (金門)}} and other [[Han Chinese|Han]] settlers in 1711.<ref name=ewang>{{citation |last=Wang |first=Erika |date=25 October 2007 |contribution=Hsinchu Owns Rich History, Culture, and Natural Resources |contribution-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028050546/https://www.chinapost.com.tw/supplement/2007/10/25/128155/Hsinchu-owns.htm |url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw |title=China Post |publisher=China Post |location=Taipei |access-date=7 December 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030231521/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/ |archive-date=30 October 2013 |url-status=live }}.</ref> Wang and his party of over 180 people were natives of [[Kinmen]] who first camped alongside what is now Dongqian Street in [[East District, Hsinchu]].<ref>{{cite news |author1=Han Cheung |title=Taiwan in Times: Hsinchu's first Han settler |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/feat/archives/2022/10/02/2003786271 |access-date=2 October 2022 |work=Taipei Times |date=2 October 2022}}</ref>

As part of the reorganization of Taiwan by [[Shen Baozhen]], the [[viceroy of Liangjiang]], Zhuqian [[Subprefecture (China)|Subprefecture]] (i.e., Tek-kham) was raised to the level of a [[county (China)|county]] and renamed Xinzhu (i.e., Sin-tek or Hsinchu) in 1878.<ref>{{citation |last1=Davidson |first1=James W. |author-link=James W.

===Japanese rule===
[[File:Txu-pclmaps-oclc-6550512-shinchiku-2221-ii.jpg|left|thumb|Map of Hsinchu (labeled as SHINCHIKU) and surrounding area (1944)]]
During the [[Japanese Taiwan|Japanese occupation]] following the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], the city{{mdash}}known at the time as Shinchiku{{mdash}}was among the province's most populous. In 1904, its 16,371 residents ranked it in [[List of cities in Taiwan|7th place]], behind [[Keelung]] and ahead of [[Changhua City|Changhua]] ("Shoka"). Shinchiku was raised to town status in 1920 and city status in 1930. At the same time, it became the seat of [[Shinchiku Prefecture]]. In 1941, its prefecture was expanded, annexing [[Xiangshan District, Hsinchu City|Xiangshan]] ("Kōzan"). Jiugang ("Kyūminato") and Liujia ("Rokka") merged to become [[Zhubei]] ("Chikuhoku").

===Republic of China===
The [[Kuomintang|Nationalist]] government of the [[Republic of China]] established the [[Hsinchu City Government]] in 1945 to oversee all of what had been Shinchiku Prefecture under the Japanese.

In 1946, the Take-Over Committee dissolved and replaced by the [[Hsinchu County Government]], located in [[Taoyuan District|Taoyuan]]. As the administrative districts were readjusted, Hsinchu was granted [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial city status]]. It used the old prefecture office as its city hall at 120 {{nowrap|Chung Cheng}} Road. In February 1946, representative congresses were formed for seven [[district (Taiwan)|district]] offices. On 15 April, the city congress was formed. Provincial representatives were elected from among the city legislators.

On 16 August 1950, the [[administrative divisions of Taiwan|administrative districts on Taiwan]] were re-adjusted once more, demarcating 16 [[county (Taiwan)|counties]] and 5 [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|provincial cities]].

In June 1982, under presidential order, the [[Xiangshan District, Hsinchu|Xiangshan Township]] of [[Hsinchu County]] merged into Hsinchu City. A new municipal government was formally established on 1 July 1982, comprising 103 [[village (Taiwan)|villages]] and 1,635 neighborhoods. These were organized into the East, North, and Xiangshan [[district (Taiwan)|districts]] by 1{{nbsp}}November.<ref>{{cite news|date=1 February 2011|url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6187|title=Rezoning Taiwan|publisher=Taiwan Today|access-date=9 December 2020}}</ref> By June 1983, the new government consisted of three bureaus (Civil Service, Public Works, and Education), four departments (Finance, Social Welfare, Compulsory Military Service, and Land Affairs), four offices (Secretary, Planning, Personnel, and Auditing), and 49 various sections. The Police Department, Tax Department, and Medicine and Hygiene Department were considered affiliate institutions.

From 1994 to 1999, as Taiwan made its transition from authoritarian rule to a [[representative democracy]] and the mostly ''pro forma'' [[Taiwan province|provincial level of government]] began to be dissolved, regulations were established for the self-government of Hsinchu. A deputy mayor, consumer officer, and three consultants were added to the city government. In 2002, the city added a Bureau of Labor and transferred Compulsory Military Service to the Department of Civil Service.

A movement is underway from 2021 to have Hsinchu City and [[Hsinchu County]] to be upgraded to the nation's seventh [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202112240025 | title=Amendment paving way for Hsinchu city-county merger clears first hurdle - Focus Taiwan | date=24 December 2021 }}</ref>

==Geography==
The city is bordered by [[Hsinchu County]] to the north and east, [[Miaoli County]] to the south, and the [[Taiwan Strait]] to the west.

===Climate===
Hsinchu's [[climate]] is [[humid subtropical]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Koppen]]: Cfa). The city is located in a part of the island that has a rainy season that lasts from February to September, with the heaviest time coming late April through August during the southwest [[monsoon]], and also experiences [[East Asian rainy season|heavy "plum rains"]] in May and early June.<ref>{{cite web |title= Monthly Mean Days of Precipitation |work=Climate Data |publisher=ROC Central Weather Bureau |url=http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V4e/climate/Data/table2_e.html |access-date=8 March 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20051203145112/http://www.cwb.gov.tw/V4e/climate/Data/table2_e.html |archive-date = 3 December 2005}}</ref> The city succumbs to hot humid weather from June until September, while October to December are arguably the most pleasant times of year. Hsinchu is affected by easterly winds off of the [[East China Sea]]. Natural hazards such as [[typhoon]]s and [[earthquake]]s are common in the region.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rescuers hunt quake survivors |date=21 September 1999 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/453087.stm |access-date=31 March 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402132228/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/453087.stm |archive-date=2 April 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Recent Earthquakes Near Hsinchu, Taiwan, Taiwan |url=http://earthquaketrack.com/tw-04-hsinchu/recent |access-date=4 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160720102309/http://earthquaketrack.com/tw-04-hsinchu/recent |archive-date=20 July 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Earthquakes Today |url=http://www.earthquakenewstoday.com/in/hsinchu/ |access-date=4 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502172825/http://www.earthquakenewstoday.com/in/hsinchu/ |archive-date=2 May 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>
