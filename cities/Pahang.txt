'''Pahang''' ({{IPA-may|paˈhaŋ}}; Pahang Hulu Malay: ''Paha'', Pahang Hilir Malay: ''Pahaeng'', Ulu Tembeling Malay: ''Pahaq''), officially '''Pahang Darul Makmur''' with the Arabic honorific ''Darul Makmur'' (Jawi: {{lang|ms-Arab|{{Script|Arab|دار المعمور}}}}, "The Abode of Tranquility") is a [[sultanate]] and a [[states and federal territories of Malaysia|federal state]] of [[Malaysia]]. It is the third largest state in the country and the largest state in [[Peninsular Malaysia]], and the ninth most populous.<ref name="DOSM Pahang"/> The state occupies the [[river basin|basin]] of the [[Pahang River]], and a stretch of the east coast as far south as [[Endau]]. The state borders the Malaysian states of [[Kelantan]] and [[Terengganu]] to the north, [[Perak]], [[Selangor]] and [[Negeri Sembilan]] to the west and [[Johor]] to the south, with the [[South China Sea]] is to the east. Pahang is separated from the west coast states by the [[Titiwangsa Mountains]] that forms a natural divider between the peninsula's east and west coasts from north to south, and from Terengganu in the east by the [[Pantai Timur Range]]. The state's highest elevation culminates at [[Mount Tahan]] in the eponymous [[Tahan Range]], which is {{convert|2187|m|ft}} high. Although two thirds of the state is covered by dense rain forest, its central plains are intersected by numerous rivers, and along the coast there is a {{convert|32|km|mi|adj=on}} wide expanse of alluvial soil that includes the deltas and estuarine plains of the [[Kuantan River|Kuantan]], Pahang, [[Rompin River|Rompin]], [[Endau River|Endau]], and [[Mersing River|Mersing]] Rivers.<ref name="Y. Tachikawa 2004"/>

The state is divided into 11 [[districts of Malaysia|districts]] ({{lang|ms|daerah}}) – Pekan, Rompin, Maran, Temerloh, Jerantut, Bentong, Raub, Lipis, Cameron Highlands and Bera. The largest district is Jerantut, which is the main gateway to the [[Taman Negara]] national park. Pahang's capital and largest city, [[Kuantan]], is the eighth largest urban area by population in Malaysia. The royal capital and the official seat of the [[Sultan of Pahang]] is located at [[Pekan, Pahang|Pekan]]. Pekan was also the old state capital and its name translates literally into 'the town', it was known historically as '[[Inderapura]]'.<ref name="Linehan 1973 2">{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=2}}</ref> Other major towns include [[Temerloh]], [[Raub, Pahang|Raub]], [[Bentong]], [[Jerantut]], [[Kuala Lipis]] and its [[hill station|hill resorts]] of [[Genting Highlands]], [[Bukit Tinggi, Pahang|Bukit Tinggi]], and [[Cameron Highlands]]. The head of state is the [[Sultan of Pahang]], while the head of government is the ''[[List of Menteris Besar of Pahang|Menteri Besar]]''. The government system is closely modeled on the [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary system]]. The [[state religion]] of Pahang is [[Islam]], but allows other religions in its territory. 

Archaeological evidence shows that humans have inhabited the area that is now Pahang since as early as the [[Paleolithic]] age. The early settlements gradually developed into an ancient maritime trading state by the 3rd century.<ref name="Munoz"/> In the 5th century, the [[Old Pahang Kingdom]] sent envoys to the [[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]] court. During the time of [[Langkasuka]], [[Srivijaya]] and [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom|Ligor]], Pahang was one of the [[Naksat cities|outlying dependencies]]. In the 15th century, the [[Pahang Sultanate]] became an autonomous kingdom within the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. Pahang entered into a [[dynastic union]] with the [[Johor Sultanate]] in the early 17th century and later emerged as an autonomous [[Pahang Kingdom|kingdom]] in the late 18th century. Following the bloody [[Pahang Civil War]] that concluded in 1863, the state under [[Ahmad Mua’zzam Shah of Pahang|Tun Ahmad]] of the [[Bendahara dynasty]], was eventually restored as a sultanate in 1881. In 1895, Pahang became a [[Federated Malay States|British protectorate]] along with Perak, Selangor and Negeri Sembilan. During the [[World War II]], Pahang and other states of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] were [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|occupied]] by the [[Empire of Japan]] from 1941 to 1945. After the war, Pahang became part of the [[Malayan Union]] before being absorbed into the [[Federation of Malaya]] which gained full independence from the British.

Modern Pahang is an economically important state with main activities in the services, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. As part of the [[East Coast Economic Region]], it is a key region for the manufacturing sector, with the local logistics support network serving as a hub for the east coast region of Peninsular Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web|title=Wilayah Ekonomi Pantai Timur (ECER)|url=http://www.pahang.gov.my/en/ecer-wilayah-ekonomi-pantai-timur-|website=www.pahang.gov.my|publisher=Pahang State Government|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2014|archive-date=22 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122031340/http://www.pahang.gov.my/en/ecer-wilayah-ekonomi-pantai-timur-|url-status=dead}}</ref> Over the years, the state has attracted much investment, both local and foreign, in the mineral sector. Important mineral exports include iron ore, gold, [[tin]] and [[bauxite]]. Malaysia's substantial oil and natural gas fields lie offshore in the South China Sea. At one time, timber resources also brought much wealth to the state. Large-scale development projects have resulted in the clearing of hundreds of square miles of land for [[oil palm]] and rubber plantations and the resettling of several hundred thousand people in new villages under federal agencies and institutions like [[Federal Land Development Authority|FELDA]], [[FELCRA Berhad|FELCRA]] and [[Rubber Industry Smallholders Development Authority|RISDA]].

== Etymology ==
The [[Khmer language|Khmer]] word for [[tin]] is pāhang<ref>{{Cite web |last=Headley |first=Robert |date=1997 |title=Modern Cambodian-English Dictionary |url=http://sealang.net/khmer/dictionary.htm}}</ref> (ប៉ាហាំង) and it is phonetically identical to {{lang|ms-arab|{{Script|Arab|ڤهڠ}}}} (note that the [[Jawi script|Jawi]] spelling, literally, "phŋ", deviates<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ahmad |first=Zainal-Abidin |date=1928 |title=Jawi spelling |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41559699 |journal=Journal of the Malayan Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=81–104 |jstor=41559699 |via=JSTOR}}</ref> from modern [[Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka]] rules although its sound is unmistakably /paahaŋ/, note that the long ā sound is not explicitly rendered or stressed in old Jawi, just like ڤد). Since the tin mines at [[Sungai Lembing]] had been known since ancient times and that the [[Malay Peninsula]] was within the sphere of influence of Khmer civilization, William Linehan hypothesized<ref name="Linehan 1973 2" /> that the name of the state was named after the Khmer word for tin (note that tin-rich [[Perak]] is also etymologically linked to tin).     

This lexemic starting point can be used to explain other derivatives terms such as the [[Pahang River]], Mahang the place (name given to Pahang by [[Jakuns]]), Mahang the tree (''[[Macaranga]]'', a common tree species in secondary forests, likely named after the toponym of the same phoneme).<ref name="Linehan 1973 2" /> The [[Proto-Malay|Proto-Malays]] of Sungai Bebar who interacted with Trito-Malays likely acquired the term from their city counterparts. The theories that the state was named after the river or tree are unsatisfactory as they do not explain how the river or the tree got their names.{{Citation needed|date=June 2024}}     

There were many variations of the name Pahang outside the [[Malay world]]. For examples, [[Song dynasty]] author Zhao Rukuo 趙汝适 wrote in Zhufanzhi 諸蕃志 (circa 1225) that Phong-hong (蓬豐 romanized according to [[Southern Min]] dialect since Zhao was from Quanzhou) was a dependency of [[Srivijaya]]. The transition from Inderapura to Pahang, approximately around the Song period indicates that Khmer influence on the state was weakened and displaced by that of Srivijaya and [[Majapahit]].

During the [[Yuan dynasty]], Pahang was known as Phenn-Khenn 彭坑 in Daoyi Zhilue 島夷志略 (circa 1349), and in Ming Shilu 明實錄 (circa 1378), it was transliterated as Pen-Heng 湓亨, and in Haiguo Wenjianlu 海國聞見錄 (circa 1730), compiled in the Qing period, Pahang was transliterated as 邦項 (Pang-hang). 

[[Arabs]] and [[Europeans]], transliterated Pahang to ''Pam, Pan, Paam, Paon, Phaan, Phang, Paham, Pahan, Pahaun, Phaung, Phahangh.''<ref name="Linehan 1973 2" />

=== Prehistory ===
Archaeological evidence shows that humans have inhabited the area that is now Pahang since as early as the [[Paleolithic]]. Relics of a of Mesolithic civilisation that used using paleolithic implements have been found at Gunung Senyum. Chipped Paleolithic artefacts without traces of polishing have been discovered at [[Sungai Lembing]], [[Kuantan]], from the remains of a 6,000 years old civilisation.<ref name="Linehan 1973 3">{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=3}}</ref> Traces of [[Hoabinhian]] culture are represented by a number of limestone cave sites.<ref name="harvnb|Benjamin||pp=88–89">{{harvnb|Benjamin|pp=88–89}}</ref> Late [[Neolithic]] relics are abundant, including polished tools, quoit discs, stone ear pendants, stone bracelets and cross-hatched bark pounders.<ref name="Linehan 1973 3"/> By around 400 BCE, the development of bronze casting led to the flourishing of the [[Đông Sơn culture]], notably for its elaborate [[Đông Sơn drums|bronze war drums]].<ref>{{harvnb|Benjamin|p=91}}</ref>

The early [[Iron Age|iron civilisation]] in Pahang that began around the beginning of [[Common Era]] is associated by prehistorians with the late neolithic culture. Relics from this era, found along the rivers are particularly numerous in the Tembeling Valley, which served as the old main northern highway of communication. Ancient [[gold working]]s in Pahang are thought to date back to this early Iron Age as well.<ref name="harvnb|Benjamin||pp=88–89"/>

The [[Kra Isthmus]] region of the [[Malay Peninsula]] and its peripheries are recognised by historians as the cradle of Malayic civilisations.<ref>{{harvnb|Barnard|2004|pp=56–57}}</ref> Primordial Malayic kingdoms are described as tributaries to [[Funan (Southeast Asia)|Funan]] by the 2nd century Chinese sources.<ref>{{harvnb|Jacq-Hergoualc'h|2002|pp=101–102}}</ref> Ancient settlements in Pahang can be traced from Tembeling to as far south as Merchong. Their tracks can also be found in the deep hinterland of Jelai, along the [[Chini Lake]], and up to the head-waters of the [[Rompin]].<ref>{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=11}}</ref> One such settlement was identified as ''Koli'' in ''[[Geographia (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' or ''Kiu-Li'', centred on the estuary of [[Pahang River]] south of [[Langkasuka]], that flourished in the 3rd century CE. It possessed an important international port, where many foreign ships stopped to barter and resupply.<ref>{{harvnb|Farish A Noor|2011|pp=19–20}}</ref> In common with most of the states in the Malay Peninsula during that time, Kiu-Li was in contact with [[Funan]]. The Chinese records mention that an embassy sent to Funan by the Indian King Murunda sailed from Kiu-Li's port (between 240 and 245 CE). Murunda presented to the Funanese King Fan Chang four horses from the [[Yuezhi]] ([[Kushan Empire|Kushan]]) stud farms.<ref name="Munoz">{{harvnb|Munoz|2007|p=47}}</ref>

By the middle of the 5th century, a polity suggested to be ancient Pahang, was described in the ''[[Book of Song]]'' as ''Pohuang'' or ''Panhuang'' (婆皇). The king of Pohuang, ''She-li Po-luo-ba-mo'' ('Sri Bhadravarman'), was recorded to have sent an envoy to the [[Liu Song dynasty|Liu Song]] court in 449–450. In 456–457, another envoy of the same country arrived at the Chinese capital, [[Jiankang]].<ref name="Guy 2014 29">{{harvnb|Guy|2014|p=29}}</ref> This ancient Pahang is believed to had been established later as a [[mueang]]<ref name="Rajani 1987 87">{{harvnb|Rajani|1987|p=87}}</ref> to the [[Mandala (political model)|mandala]] of [[Langkasuka]]-[[Kedah Kingdom|Kedah]] centred in modern-day [[Patani (historical region)|Patani]] region that rose to prominence with the regression of Funan from the 6th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Farish A Noor|2011|p=17}}</ref> By the beginning of the 8th century, Langkasuka-Kedah came under the military and political hegemony of [[Srivijaya]].<ref>{{harvnb|Farish A Noor|2011|p=36}}</ref> In the 11th century, the power vacuum left by the collapse of Srivijaya was filled by the [[Nakhon Si Thammarat Kingdom]], commonly known in Malay tradition as 'Ligor'. During this period, Pahang, designated as ''Muaeng Pahang''<ref name="Rajani 1987 87"/> was established as one of the twelve [[Naksat cities|naksat city states]]<ref>{{harvnb|Rajani|1987|p=65}}</ref> of Ligor.<ref>{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|pp=9–10}}</ref>

In the 14th century, Pahang began consolidating its influence in the southern part of the Malay Peninsula. The kingdom, described by Portuguese historian, [[Manuel Godinho de Erédia]] as ''Pam'', was one of the two kingdoms of ''[[Malays (ethnic group)|Malayos]]'' in the peninsula, in succession to [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani]], that flourished before the establishment of the [[Malacca Sultanate]]. The Maharaja of Pahang, was also the overlord of countries of ''Ujong Tanah'' ('land's end'), on the southern part of the peninsula including [[Temasek]].<ref>{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|pp=6–7}}</ref> The Majapahit chronicle, ''[[Nagarakretagama]]'' even used the name Pahang to designate the [[Malay Peninsula]], an indication of the importance of this kingdom.<ref>{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=1}}</ref> The ''[[History of Ming]]'' records several envoy missions from Pahang to the Ming court in the 14th and 15th centuries. In 1378, Maharaja Tajau sent envoys with a letter on a gold leaf and sent six foreign slaves and products of the country as tribute. In 1411, during the reign of Maharaja ''Pa-la-mi-so-la-ta-lo-si-ni'' (transliterated by historian as 'Parameswara Teluk Chini'), he also sent envoys carrying tribute.<ref>{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=5}}</ref>

=== Old sultanate ===
{{main|Pahang Sultanate}}
[[File:Nieuhof-Ambassade-vers-la-Chine-1665 0737.tif|thumb|left|250px|[[Tioman Island]] in 1665.]]
The Old Pahang Sultanate centred in modern-day [[Pekan]] was established in the 15th century. At the height of its influence, the sultanate was an important power in Southeast Asia and controlled the entire Pahang basin, bordering the [[Pattani Kingdom|Pattani Sultanate]] to the north and the [[Johor Sultanate]] to the south. To the west, its  jurisdiction extended over parts of modern-day [[Selangor]] and [[Negeri Sembilan]].<ref name="Linehan 1973 31">{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=31}}</ref>

The sultanate has its origin as a vassal to the [[Malacca Sultanate]], with its first sultan, [[Muhammad Shah of Pahang|Muhammad Shah]] having been a Malaccan prince, and was the grandson of [[Dewa Sura]], the last pre-Malaccan ruler of [[Old Pahang Kingdom|Pahang]].<ref name="Linehan 1973 31"/> Over the years, Pahang grew independent from Malaccan control and at one point even established itself as a rival to Malacca<ref>{{harvnb|Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid|2011|p=80}}</ref> until the latter's [[Capture of Malacca (1511)|demise in 1511]]. In 1528, the last Sultan of Malacca, [[Mahmud Shah of Malacca|Mahmud Shah]] died. Pahang joined forces with his successor, [[Alauddin Riayat Shah II]] who established himself in Johor to expel the Portuguese from the Malay Peninsula. Two attempts were made in 1547 at [[Muar (town)|Muar]] and in 1551 at [[Portuguese Malacca]]. However, in the face of superior Portuguese arms and vessels, the Pahang and Johor forces were forced to retreat on both occasions.<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 81">{{harvnb|Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid|2011|p=81}}</ref>

During the reign of Sultan [[Abdul Kadir Alauddin Shah of Pahang|Abdul Kadir]], Pahang enjoyed a brief period of cordial relations with the Portuguese. However, this relationship was discontinued by his successor, Sultan [[Ahmad Shah II of Pahang|Ahmad II]]. The next ruler, Sultan [[Abdul Ghafur Muhiuddin Shah of Pahang|Abdul Ghafur]] attacked the Portuguese and simultaneously challenged the Dutch presence in the [[Strait of Malacca]]. Nevertheless, in 1607, Pahang not only tolerated the [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]], but, following a visit by [[Cornelis Matelief de Jonge|Admiral Matelief de Jonge]], even cooperated with them in an attempt to get rid of the Portuguese.<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 81"/>

The Sultan tried to reforge the Johor-Pahang alliance to assist the Dutch. However, a quarrel which erupted between Sultan Abdul Ghafur and [[Alauddin Riayat Shah III of Johor]], resulted in Johor declaring war on Pahang in 1612. With the aid of Sultan [[Abdul Jalilul Akbar]] of [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]], Pahang eventually defeated Johor in 1613. Sultan Abdul Ghafur's son, [[Alauddin Riayat Shah of Pahang|Alauddin Riyat Shah]] ascended to the throne in 1614. In 1615, the [[Aceh Sultanate|Acehnese]] under [[Iskandar Muda]] invaded Pahang, forcing Alauddin Riayat Shah to retreat into the interior. He nevertheless continued to exercise some ruling powers. His reign in exile is considered to have officially ended after the installation of a distant relative, [[Abdul Jalil Shah III|Raja Bujang]] to the Pahangese throne in 1615, with the support of the Portuguese following a pact between the Portuguese and Sultan of Johor.<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 81"/>

Raja Bujang who reigned as Abdul Jalil Shah was eventually deposed in the Acehnese invasion in 1617, but restored to the Pahangese throne and also installed as the new [[Sultan of Johor]] following the death of his uncle, [[Abdullah Ma'ayat Shah]] in 1623. This event led to the union of the crown of Pahang and Johor, and the formal establishment of the [[Johor Empire]].<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 81"/>

{{main|Pahang Kingdom|Federated Malay States|Federation of Malaya}}
[[File:CO 1069-505-01 (7893293906).jpg|thumb|[[Ahmad al-Muadzam Shah of Pahang|Sultan Ahmad]] and his attendants circa 1897. The ruler seized the Pahang throne in 1863 after six years of [[Pahang Civil War|civil war]] against his brother [[Tun Mutahir of Pahang|Tun Mutahir]] and his [[Straits Settlements|British]]-[[Johor]] allies. His reign marked the restoration of Pahang as a Sultanate and modernisation of the state.]]
The modern Pahang kingdom came into existence with the consolidation of power by the [[Bendahara dynasty|Bendahara family]] in Pahang, following the gradual disintegration of [[Johor Empire]]. Self-rule was established in Pahang in the late 18th century, with [[Tun Abdul Majid of Pahang|Tun Abdul Majid]] declared as the first [[raja bendahara]].<ref name="Linehan 1973 52">{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=52}}</ref> The area around Pahang formed a part of the hereditary domains attached to this title and administered directly by the raja bendahara. The weakening of the Johor Sultanate and the disputed succession to the throne was coupled with the increasing independence of the [[Bendahara]] in Pahang, the [[Temenggong]] in Johor and Singapore, and the Yamtuan Muda in Riau.<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 82">{{harvnb|Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid|2011|p=82}}</ref>

In 1853, the fourth raja bendahara [[Tun Ali of Pahang|Tun Ali]], renounced his allegiance to the Sultan of Johor and became the independent ruler of Pahang.<ref>{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|p=66}}</ref><ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 83">{{harvnb|Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid|2011|p=83}}</ref> He was able to maintain peace and stability during his reign. After his death in 1857 his younger son [[Sultan Ahmad al-Muadzam Shah|Wan Ahmad]] challenged the succession of his half-brother [[Tun Mutahir of Pahang|Tun Mutahir]], in a dispute that escalated into a [[Pahang Civil War|civil war]]. Supported by the neighbouring [[Terengganu|Terengganu Sultanate]] and the Siamese, Wan Ahmad emerged victorious, establishing control over important towns and expelled his brother in 1863. He served as the last raja bendahara, and was proclaimed [[Sultan of Pahang]] by his chiefs in 1881.<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 83"/>

Due to internal strife within Pahang, the British pressured Sultan Ahmad to agree to the presence of a British adviser. Aided by Sultan [[Abu Bakar of Johor]] and William Fraser of the Pahang Mining Company, they succeeded in convincing Sultan Ahmad to accept a British agent, [[Hugh Clifford (colonial administrator)|Hugh Clifford]], in December 1887. In October 1888, Sultan Ahmad reluctantly accepted [[John Pickersgill Rodger]] as Pahang's first Resident. Following the intervention, Sultan Ahmad became a Ruler-in-Council and acted in accordance with the advice of the British Resident and the State Council, except in matters pertaining Islam and Malay customs. Taxes were to be collected in the name of the sultan by the Resident, with the assistance of European officers.<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 84">{{harvnb|Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid|2011|p=84}}</ref>

Between 1890 and 1895, [[Dato' Bahaman]], the Orang Kaya Setia Perkasa Pahlawan of Semantan, and [[Tok Gajah|Imam Perang Rasu]], the Orang Kaya Imam Perang Indera Gajah of Pulau Tawar, led a revolt against the British encroachment. Sultan Ahmad appeared to be co-operating with the British, but he was known to be sympathetic  to the dissidents. By 1895 the revolt was suppressed by the British and many of the dissidents surrendered. In July 1895, Sultan Ahmad signed the Federation Agreement, which made Pahang, along with [[Perak]], Selangor and [[Negeri Sembilan]], one of the [[Federated Malay States]], a protectorate of the [[British Empire]]. This had effectively reduced the Sultan's powers and authority, as did the creation of Federal Council in 1909. The executive and legislative functions of the State Council became increasingly nominal.<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 84"/>

Like other [[Malay States]], Pahang suffered during the [[Japanese occupation of Malaya]] until 1945. During the Japanese Occupation, the reigning Sultan [[Abu Bakar of Pahang|Abu Bakar]] opened a large potato plantation behind the Terentang Palace to help ease the food shortage and he personally approved proposals to form the ''[[Rejimen Askar Wataniah|Askar Wataniah]]'', an underground Malay resistance force. The Sultan spent the final days of the occupation in a jungle hideout with members of [[Force 136]], resistance fighters and refugees. In late 1945, to mark the decommissioning of the Askar Wataniah, the troops paraded through [[Pekan]] and submitted to a royal inspection, after which they were honoured at the Sa'adah Palace with what has been called 'the first ''[[ronggeng]]'' of the liberation'.<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 85">{{harvnb|Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid|2011|p=85}}</ref>

During his reign, Sultan Abu Bakar revived the office of State Mufti and established the Pahang Islamic and Malay Customs Council. The state's administrative capital, which was established in [[Kuala Lipis]] during British intervention, was moved to [[Kuantan]].<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 85"/>

After [[World War II]], Pahang formed the [[Federation of Malaya]] with the other eight [[Malay States]] and two [[Straits Settlements|British Crown Colonies]], Malacca and Penang in 1948. The semi-independent Malaya was granted independence in 1957, and was then reconstituted as [[Malaysia]] with the inclusion the states of Singapore (left the federation in 1965), [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] in 1963.

== Geography ==
[[File:Cameron Highlands Tea Plantation 2012.JPG|thumb|[[Cameron Highlands]].]]
Pahang covers an area of {{convert|35965|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}},<ref name="DOSM Pahang"/> and is the third largest state in Malaysia after [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]], and the largest in [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. Geographically diverse, Pahang occupies the vast [[Pahang River]] basin, which is enclosed by the [[Titiwangsa Mountains|Titiwangsa]] Range to the west and the eastern highlands to the north. Although about two thirds of the state is dense jungle,<ref>{{harvnb|WWF-Malaysia|1997|p=4}}</ref> its central plains are intersected by numerous rivers, joining to form the Pahang River which dominates the drainage system. Pahang is divided into three [[ecoregion]]s, the freshwater systems, the lowlands and highlands rainforests and the coastline.<ref name="Y. Tachikawa 2004">{{harvnb|Y. Tachikawa|R. James|K. Abdullah|Mohd. Nor bin Mohd. Desa|2004}}</ref>

The [[Pahang River]] basin connects with Malaysia's two largest natural freshwater lakes, [[Bera Lake|Bera]] and [[Chini Lake|Chini]]. Described as wetland of international importance, Bera Lake was accepted as Malaysia's first [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] site in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annotated List of Wetlands of International Importance - Malaysia|url=https://rsis.ramsar.org/sites/default/files/rsiswp_search/exports/Ramsar-Sites-annotated-summary-Malaysia.pdf?1507864871|website=www.ramsar.org|publisher=The Ramsar Convention Secretatiat|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2014}}</ref>

The highest peak, [[Mount Tahan]], reaches {{convert|2187|m|ft|abbr=on}} in elevation, which is also the highest point in Peninsular Malaysia. The climate is temperate enough to have distinct temperature variations year round, and much of the highlands are covered with tropical [[rainforest]]. Pahang is home to two of Malaysia's [[national park]]s, [[Taman Negara]] and [[Endau-Rompin National Park|Endau-Rompin]], both located in the north and south of the state respectively. These large [[Rainforest|primary rainforests]] are extensive, and are home to many rare or endangered animals, such as the [[tapir]], [[Chevrotain|mouse-deer]], tigers, elephants and [[leopard]]s. [[Fern]]s are also extremely common, mainly due to the high humidity and fog that permeates the area. Popular hill resorts located along these main highland areas are [[Cameron Highlands]], [[Genting Highlands]], [[Fraser's Hill]] and [[Bukit Tinggi, Pahang|Bukit Tinggi]]. The Cameron Highlands is home to extensive tea plantations and also a major supplier of [[legume]]s and vegetables to both [[Malaysia]] and Singapore. The largest of [[Federal Land Development Authority|Felda]]'s palm oil plantations in Malaysia are located in the Jengka Triangle centred around the [[Bandar Tun Razak, Jengka|Bandar Tun Razak]] in [[Maran]] district.

[[File:Cherating, Pantai Cherating.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cherating]] beach.]]
Pahang's long, coastline has sandy beaches like [[Cherating]], [[Teluk Cempedak]], [[Beserah]], [[Batu Hitam]] and [[Tanjung Sepat, Pahang|Tanjung Sepat]]. Also located along the coastal plain, is a {{convert|32|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}} wide expanse of alluvial soil that includes the deltas and estuarine plains of the Kuantan, Pahang, Rompin, Endau, and Mersing Rivers.<ref name="Y. Tachikawa 2004"/> Important economic centres can be found along the coastline, where both capital and royal capital of the state, [[Kuantan]] and [[Pekan]], are located. About 58&nbsp;km off the coast of Pahang lies [[Tioman Island]], in the South China Sea, acclaimed as one of the best island getaways in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title= Tioman|url=http://www.pahangtourism.org.my/index.php/tioman|website=www.pahangtourism.org.my|publisher=Pahang Tourism Office|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2017}}</ref>

Pahang has a [[tropical geography]] with an [[tropical rainforest climate|equatorial climate]] and a year-round of humidity of no less than 75%. It is warm and humid throughout the year with temperatures ranging from 21&nbsp;°C to 33&nbsp;°C. The rainfall here averages 200&nbsp;mm monthly, a large proportion of which occurs during the [[northeast monsoon]]. Precipitation is the lowest in March, with an average of 22.25&nbsp;mm. In October and November, the precipitation reaches its peak, with an average of 393&nbsp;mm. The hottest month in Pahang is May when the average maximum temperature is 33°, average temperature is 28° and average minimum temperature is 24°. At highland areas, the temperature can vary from {{convert|23|C|F}} during daytime to {{convert|16|C|F}} during night time.<ref name="Pahang Tourism Climate">{{cite web|title=Climate|url=http://www.pahangtourism.org.my/index.php/about-us/travellers-essentials2/climate|website=www.pahangtourism.org.my|publisher=Pahang Tourism Office|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Annual average weather for Pahang, Malaysia|url=https://beach-weather.com/South-Eastern-Asia/Malaysia/Pahang/averages/|website=www.beach-weather.com|publisher=Beach Weather|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2017}}</ref>

Pahang experiences two [[monsoon]] seasons: a northeast monsoon and a southwest monsoon. The tropical storms of the northeast monsoon wash ashore from the end of October until the beginning of March ever year, bringing heavy rainfall, powerful currents and unpredictable tempest of the monsoon season coming in from the South China Sea. The southwest monsoon, which occurs beginning March every year, brings somewhat less rainfall, with sunny and tropical weather up until the end of October.<ref name="Pahang Tourism Climate"/>

<!--
=== Highlands ===
[[File:Cameron Highlands Tea Plantation 2012.JPG|thumb|[[Cameron Highlands]].]]
Peninsular Malaysia straddles a rich [[quartz]] vein that is associated with the mountain range in the centre. [[Rainforest]] covers much of the highlands, but it tends to be thinner, with more [[deciduous]] trees. [[Fern]]s are also extremely common, thanks mainly to the high humidity and fog that permeates the area.

The [[Cameron Highlands]] area in the west is home to extensive tea plantations. The area is the highest on the mainland, and the climate is temperate enough to have distinct temperature variations year round. The area is also known as a major supplier of [[legume]]s and vegetables to both [[Malaysia]] and Singapore.

[[Genting Highlands]] is known as Malaysia's playground. It is home to several hotels, a theme park and Malaysia's only casino. Genting Highlands was developed by [[Lim Goh Tong]], who envisioned a hillside getaway destination for people wanting to get away from city hustle and bustle, and is conveniently situated 40 minutes from the capital of [[Kuala Lumpur]], accessible by highway. The border of Genting Highlands straddles both the states of Pahang and [[Selangor]].

The famous silk merchant and fashion designer [[Jim Thompson (designer)|Jim Thompson]] mysteriously disappeared in the area, and it was also home to the [[Communist]] guerrillas who fought the British during the 1950s.

[[Fraser's Hill]] was used as a British summer getaway to escape the tropical heat. It is distinctive that the road to and from [[Fraser's Hill]] is a single lane up the hill and traffic limited to a single direction at certain hours. It is now a small hamlet with British architectural buildings and also a holiday destination.

There is also a population of native [[Orang Asli]] who live in the area, although most have been relocated from the forests to other areas.

=== Rainforest ===
The north of the state is home to the country's largest [[national park]], [[Taman Negara]].  This large [[Rainforest|primary rainforest]] is extensive, and is home to many rare or endangered animals, such as the [[tapir]], [[kancil]], tigers, elephants and [[leopard]]s.

Rainforest covers 2/3 of the area of the state, and the peninsula's highest point, [[Mount Tahan]], is located within Taman Negara. Since the equator is so close, the rain forests in Malaysia are among the oldest in the world: roughly 130 million years old.

=== Rivers and lakes ===
Two famous lakes are found in Pahang. [[Bera Lake]] is a [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] site and is important for its rich freshwater [[peat]] environment, home to various flora and fauna. The [[Semelai]] [[Orang Asli]] live in the area and continue their traditional way of life, hunting, fishing and making use of their natural environment.

[[Chini Lake]] is home to a legend whereby a [[dragon]] was believed to reside in the lake. Talks also abound about a lost city that sunk beneath the water. Famed for its [[nelumbo|lotus]] blooms, recently controversy has sparked with mismanaged tourism development resulting in the massive die off of trees, and recent findings of pollution in the water.

=== Coastline ===
[[File:TelukCempedak.jpg|thumb|Chempedak Bay.]]
The largely mountainous state flattens out towards the coastline, and this is where the state capital [[Kuantan]] is located.  There are also many islands offshore, including [[Tioman Island]], with extensive [[coral reef]] systems. Fine stretches of beach are found from Kuantan heading to [[Terengganu]].

A traditional fishing industry still exists along the coast. [[Prawn cracker#Malaysia|Keropok]] dried fish cakes are a welcome favourite among locals and traditional industry includes the mass processing of dried fish and seafood as well as the famed ''keropok lekor''.

=== Biodiversity ===
Malaysia, as a nation, is considered one of the most biodiverse on earth.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.cbd.int/countries/profile/?country=my |title=Malaysia Main Details Biodiversity Facts |website=CBD.int |publisher=Convention on Biological Diversity |accessdate=6 June 2023}}</ref> Pahang maintains a protected network of managed areas rich in flora, fauna, and natural resources, in spite of [[deforestation]], rapid industrialisation and an ever-growing population. In Pahang, there are some 74 forest reserves, including ten virgin-jungle reserves and 13 different amenity forests, [[wildlife reserves]], [[national parks]] and offshore [[marine park]]s. There are many examples of nationally- and internationally-relevant areas, including the [[Krau Wildlife Reserve]], [[Bera Lake|Bera Lake Ramsar Site]], [[Tioman Island|Tioman Island Marine Park]] and [[Cameron Highlands|Cameron Highlands Wildlife Sanctuary]].<ref name="WWF-Malaysia 1997 1">{{harvnb|WWF-Malaysia|1997|p=1}}</ref>

Total forest in Pahang is about 2,367,000 ha (66% of the land area), of which 89% is a dryland forest, 10% peat swamp forest, and 1% [[mangrove]]s. About 56% of the total forest is within the Permanent Forest Estate. This includes almost the full range of forest types found in Malaysia, although some of the more unique environments (such as heath forest or forest on ultrabasic rocks) exist only in fragmented areas of Pahang. The protected forest within [[Taman Negara]] and [[Krau Wildlife Reserve]] includes small areas of extreme lowland [[alluvial plains]]. Elsewhere, most of the dryland forest in Pahang is on steep slopes, therefore benefiting from both catchment protection and slope protection functions.<ref name="WWF-Malaysia 1997 1"/> Virtually every species of bird and [[mammal]] found in Peninsular Malaysia has been recorded in Pahang, other than a few confined to the north of the country or the west coast. There are a large number of montane species. Peaks within Taman Negara, [[Mount Benom]], and peaks along the [[Titiwangsa Mountains|Titiwangsa Range]], with different endemic species in each of these montane regions are located in Pahang. The large forest blocks of the west and northeast support nationally important populations of big mammals and other fauna, and act as a unit with Taman Negara.<ref>{{harvnb|WWF-Malaysia|1997|p=5}}</ref>

[[File:Clownfishes, Paya Beach, Tioman - panoramio.jpg|thumb|[[Clownfish]] at Paya Beach, [[Tioman Island]].]]
The Pahang River is the longest river on the peninsula, and from its headwaters to the estuary it includes virtually all of the natural river types. These range from montane streams, saraca streams and neram rivers to rasau and nipah tidal reaches. [[Drainage basin|Water catchments]] have been defined as covering 81% of the state and more than half of this is forested.<ref>{{harvnb|WWF-Malaysia|1997|p=3}}</ref> The huge network of rivers in Pahang is home to freshwater aquatic biodiversity, important to the economy of the state. Connecting to this riverine systems are a number of natural freshwater lakes, most notably [[Bera Lake|Bera]] and [[Chini Lake|Chini]] lakes. Surrounded by a patchwork of dry lowland dipterocarp forests, the lake environment stretches its tentacles into islands of peat swamp forests. Rich in wildlife and vegetation, the lakes provide an ecosystem which supports not only a diversity of animal and plant life, but sustains the livelihood of the [[Orang Asal]], the aboriginal people inhabiting the wetlands.

Most of the coastline is sandy, with rocky headlands at intervals. [[Mangrove]]s and [[Nypa fruticans|nipah]] swamps are confined to estuaries and do not occur along the exposed coast. These estuaries can be seasonally important to fishermen when rough weather prevents fishing at sea. There are limited areas of hard and soft coral offshore, which have been mapped together with coastal features. There are many islands off the east coast, the largest being [[Tioman Island|Tioman]] and Seri Buat islands. Besides the island populations of fauna and flora, which sometimes differ genetically from mainland forms of the same species, these islands are of value for the reefs and other bottom features which support marine biological diversity. The reefs in particular are sensitive to sedimentation from activities on land. These features are related to the maintenance of marine fisheries, an important sector of the coastal economy. Tioman, Chebeh, Tulai, Sembilang and Seri Buat islands constitute the Tioman group of islands within the Marine Parks system of Peninsular Malaysia.<ref>{{harvnb|WWF-Malaysia|1997|p=6}}</ref>

The modern constitution of Pahang, the ''Undang-Undang Tubuh Kerajaan Pahang'', was first drafted on 1 February 1948. It was formally adopted on 25 February 1959. The constitution proclaims that Pahang is a [[constitutional monarchy]]. The constitutional head is the [[Sultan of Pahang|Sultan]], who is described as "the fountain head of justice and of all authority of government" in the state. He who is vested with the power as a monarch of the state, is also the Head of Islam and the source of all titles and dignities, honours and awards.<ref>{{harvnb|Farish A Noor|2011|p=116}}</ref><ref name="Constitution">{{cite web|title=Constitution of Pahang|url=http://www.dirajapahang.my/portaldiraja/muat_turun/Undang2%20Tubuh.pdf|website=www.dirajapahang.my|publisher=Portal Diraja Pahang|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2016}}</ref> The current Sultan belong to the male line of the [[Bendahara dynasty]] who have been ruling the state since the 17th century.<ref name="Linehan 1973 52"/> Since 2019, the reigning monarch has been [[Abdullah of Pahang|Abdullah]]. He was proclaimed as Sultan on 15 January 2019, succeeding his father, [[Ahmad Shah of Pahang|Ahmad Shah]], whose abdication was decided at a Royal Council meeting on 11 January. On 24 January 2019, days after his accession to the throne of Pahang, he was elected as the 16th [[Yang di-Pertuan Agong]] of Malaysia, succeeding [[Muhammad V of Kelantan|Muhammad V]] who abdicated from the throne on 6 January. [[Succession order]] to the throne of Pahang is generally determined roughly by [[agnatic primogeniture]]. No female may become ruler, and female line descendants are generally excluded from succession. In Pahang traditional political structure, the offices of ''Orang Besar Berempat'' ('four major chiefs') are the most important positions after the Sultan himself. The four hereditary territorial [[magnate]]s are; [[Orang Kaya Indera Pahlawan]], [[Orang Kaya Indera Perba Jelai]], [[Orang Kaya Indera Segara]] and [[Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar]]. Next in the hierarchy were the ''Orang Besar Berlapan'' ('eight chiefs') and ''Orang Besar Enam Belas'' ('sixteen chiefs') who were subordinated to the principal nobles.<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 82"/>

The Sultan headed two institutions, the [[Pahang State Legislative Assembly|State Legislative Assembly]] and [[Pahang State Executive Council|State Executive Council]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Organisational Structure of the State Government|url=http://www.pahang.gov.my/en/struktur-pentadbiran-kerajaan-negeri|website=www.pahang.gov.my|publisher=Pahang State Government|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022105915/http://www.pahang.gov.my/en/struktur-pentadbiran-kerajaan-negeri|archive-date=22 October 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The legislative branch of the state is the unicameral ''Dewan Undangan Negeri'' ('State Legislative Assembly') whose 42 members are elected from single-member constituencies. The assembly has the power to enact the state laws. State government is led by a [[List of Menteris Besar of Pahang|Menteri Besar]], who is a member of the State Legislative Assembly from the majority party. According to the constitution of Pahang, the Menteri Besar is required to be a Malay and a Muslim, appointed by the ruler from the party that commands the majority of the State Legislative Assembly.<ref name="Constitution"/> By convention, state elections are held concurrently with the federal election, held at least once every five years, the most recent of which took place in [[Malaysian general election, 2018|May 2018]]. Registered voters of age 21 and above may vote for the members for the state legislative chamber.<ref>{{cite web|author=Shahanaaz Habib|title=Stand up and be counted|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2016/10/23/stand-up-and-be-counted-there-are-42-million-malaysians-who-are-eligible-to-vote-but-they-have-not-r/|website=www.thestar.com.my|publisher=The Star Online|access-date=29 October 2017|date=23 October 2016}}</ref>

As a federal state, Pahang is subjected to [[Law of Malaysia|Malaysia's legal system]] which is based on [[English Common Law]]. The highest court in the judicial system is the [[Federal Court of Malaysia|Federal Court]], followed by the [[Court of Appeal of Malaysia|Court of Appeal]] and the [[High Court of Malaya]]. Malaysia also has a special court to hear cases brought by or against royalty. The death penalty is in use for serious crimes such as murder, terrorism, drug trafficking, and kidnapping. Separate from and running parallel to the civil courts, are the [[Syariah Court]], which apply [[Sharia]] law to Muslims in the areas of family law and religious observances. As provided in Article 3 of the [[Constitution of Malaysia|Federal Constitution]], Syariah or Islamic law is a matter of state law, passed in the State Legislative Assembly. Matters related to the enforcement of the Syariah law falls under the jurisdiction of the ''Jabatan Agama Islam Pahang'' ('Pahang Islamic Religious Department'). Pahang's constitution empowers the Sultan as the head of Islam and Malay customs in the state. State council known as ''Majlis Ugama Islam dan Adat Resam Melayu Pahang'' ('Council of Islam and Malay Customs of Pahang') is responsible in advising the ruler as well as regulating both Islamic affairs and [[adat]].<ref name="Constitution"/>

The administrative divisions in Pahang are originated from the time of the old [[Pahang Sultanate]], whereby [[magnate|territorial magnates]] appointed by the Sultan to administer the historical divisions of the state.<ref>{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|pp=190–194}}</ref> The largest historical divisions were; Jelai (corresponds to modern day [[Lipis District]]), [[Temerloh]], [[Chenor]] (corresponds to modern day [[Maran District]]) and [[Pekan]], each administered by the four major chiefs (''Orang Besar Berempat''). Next in the hierarchy were the ''Orang Besar Berlapan'' ('eight chiefs') and then ''Orang Besar Enam Belas'' ('sixteen chiefs') who were subordinated to their respective principal nobles. The lowest of this traditional hierarchy are the ''Tok Empat'' or village headmen who were subordinated to ''Tok Mukim'', who in turn subordinated to ''[[Penghulu|Tok Penghulu]]'', who in turn subordinated to one of the sixteen chiefs.<ref name="Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid 2011 82"/>

In modern times, the ''Tok Empat'' became formally known as ''Ketua Kampung'' (literally 'village headman'), although continued to be referred as such informally. He is subordinated to a [[Penghulu]], the head of the [[mukim]], who in turn subordinated to the [[district officer]].

Historically, by the 19th century, Pahang's economy, like in ancient times, was still heavily dependent on the export of gold.

Access to [[improved water source]] in Malaysia is 100%. The [[water supply]] in Pahang is managed by the Pahang Water Management Berhad or ''Pengurusan Air Pahang Berhad'' (PAIP). The department is also responsible for the planning, development, management of water supply as well as billing and collection of payment. In Pahang, water supply comes mainly from rivers and streams and there are about 79 water treatment plants located in various districts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Water Supply|url=http://www.investinpahang.gov.my/index.php?ch=en_investinpahang&pg=en_utilities&ac=10|website=www.inevstinpahang.gov.my|publisher=Pahang State Development Corporation|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2012}}</ref> Pahang abundant water sources are also significant to the growing demand of water supply in [[Greater Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Selangor]], the industrial heartland of Malaysia.

=== Internet and telecommunication ===
In 2016, the household internet broadband penetration per 100 inhabitants in Pahang was relatively high among states of the east coast, but was lower than Malaysian national figure, 71.7 versus 99.8.<ref>{{cite web|title=Facts and Figures - First Quarter|url=https://www.mcmc.gov.my/skmmgovmy/files/ae/ae45902b-84fa-43ea-be64-112091a5d234/files/assets/basic-html/page-1.html#|website=www.mcmc.gov.my|publisher=Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2017|page=2}}</ref> Extensive efforts to increase internet access, have been undertaken by the government since 2007 to bridge the digital divide, focusing especially the rural areas. Since 2013, the programs have been expanded to include underserved urban communities as well. As of 2015, 89 [[internet centre]]s have been established in Pahang, in addition to 11 Mini Community Broadband centres and 1 Community Broadband Library. Community WiFi (WK) initiative has also been implemented by the government since 2011 to provide free internet access through Wifi hotspots. In Pahang alone, a total number of 199 Community [[Wi-Fi]] have been set up. In terms of [[fixed line]] broadband, suburban broadband initiatives were outlined in the Eleventh Malaysia Plan to increase broadband accessibility in suburban and rural areas. By 2016, the number of ports in Pahang was growing up to 7,936 ports, the fourth highest in Malaysia after Selangor, Johor and Perak.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Report - Universal Service Provision|url=https://www.mcmc.gov.my/skmmgovmy/files/b7/b75d963f-edda-4dd8-8b59-c4bdeac5409c/files/assets/basic-html/page-10.html|website=www.mcmc.gov.my|publisher=Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2015|pages=10–35}}</ref>

The [[mobile telecommunication]] penetration, although increasingly popular, was lower compared to the national figure per 100 inhabitants, 130.9 against national figure 143.8. Cellular coverage expansion in Pahang is served by 207 communication towers, with [[3G]] [[mobile broadband]] coverage has been expanded to 150 sites and [[LTE (telecommunication)|LTE]] mobile broadband to 42 sites respectively. To accommodate the demand for high-speed mobile broadband, the [[core network]] capacity has been upgraded, with [[fibre-optic network]] has been expanded in 2015 to a total 45.6&nbsp;km.<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Report - Universal Service Provision|url=https://www.mcmc.gov.my/skmmgovmy/files/b7/b75d963f-edda-4dd8-8b59-c4bdeac5409c/files/assets/basic-html/page-10.html|website=www.mcmc.gov.my|publisher=Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2015|pages=26–31}}</ref> In 2015, an initiative was announced by the federal government to connect the Peninsular and the East Malaysia states, Sabah and Sarawak with [[submarine cable|submarine fibre optic cable]] network bringing 4 terabits per second capacity with a total distance of approximately 3,800 kilometres.

=== Transportation ===

Much like many former British protectorates, Pahang uses a [[dual carriageway]] with [[Right- and left-hand traffic|the left-hand traffic rule]]. As of 2013, Pahang had a total of {{convert|19132|km}} of connected roadways, with {{convert|12425|km}} being paved state routes, {{convert|702|km}} of dirt tracks, {{convert|2173|km}} of gravel roads, and {{convert|3832.6|km}} of paved federal road.<ref>{{cite web|title=Basic Data of Malaysia|url=http://www.rurallink.gov.my/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1-DATA-ASAS-MALAYSIA1.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.rurallink.gov.my/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1-DATA-ASAS-MALAYSIA1.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|website=www.rurallink.gov.my|publisher=Ministry of Rural and Regional Development|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2015|page=45}}</ref> The primary route in Pahang is the [[East Coast Expressway]], which is the extension of [[Kuala Lumpur–Karak Expressway]], that connects the east coast and the west coast of the Peninsular Malaysia. The expressway passes through 3 states of the peninsular; Pahang, Terengganu and Selangor, connects [[Kuantan Port]] to the [[National Grid (Malaysia)|national grid]] and links many important town and cities of the east coast to the industrial heartland of Malaysia in the west. Another important route, the [[Central Spine Road]] which was laid out in the Eleventh Malaysian Plan, is an alternative road to the east coast, connecting [[Kuala Krai]] in Kelantan and [[Bentong District]] in Pahang.

The main railway line is the [[KTM East Coast Railway Line]], nicknamed the 'Jungle Railway' for its route that passes through the sparsely populated and heavily forested interior. It is operated by [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] Berhad, a federal government-linked company. The 526&nbsp;km long single track metre gauge that runs between [[Gemas]] in Negeri Sembilan and [[Tumpat District|Tumpat]] in Kelantan, was historically used during British protectorate to transport [[Tin]]. A more advanced railway line, the [[Double-track railway|double-track]] and [[Electric locomotive|electrified]] [[MRL East Coast Rail Link]] (ECRL), was announced in 2016 as a project under [[East Coast Economic Region|ECER]]'s master plan, to transport both passengers and cargo. The planned 688&nbsp;km long new railway line is set to form the backbone of ECER's [[multimodal transport]] infrastructure, linking the existing transportation hub in ECER Special Economic Zone (SEZ) with the west coast region.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Ganeshwaran Kana|author2=Gurmeet Kaur|title=The real economics of ECRL|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/business/business-news/2017/08/12/the-real-economics-of-ecrl/|website=www.thestar.com.my|publisher=The Star Online|access-date=29 October 2017|date=12 August 2017}}</ref>

The Special Economic Zone that centred at [[Kuantan]],<ref name="ECERDC"/> is the main transportation hub for bus services, air routes and sea routes for the entire east coast region. [[Terminal Kuantan Sentral]] serves as the land transportation hub, offering intrastate services that connects all districts of Pahang, as well as interstate services that links the state to the rest of the Peninsular, including Singapore and Thailand. In 2012, the government announced that [[Prasarana]], which runs [[Rapid KL]], would take over all public bus services in Kuantan under a new entity, [[Rapid Kuantan]]. The only airport in Pahang is [[Sultan Ahmad Shah Airport]], also known as Kuantan Airport. Located 15&nbsp;km from Kuantan, it serves both [[domestic flight|domestic]] and [[international flight]]s. Direct international flights connect the state with Singapore. The airport serves the national carrier [[Malaysia Airlines]] and its [[low-cost carrier|low-cost]] subsidiary [[Firefly (airline)|Firefly]]. It also houses the 6th Squadron and 19th Squadron of the [[Royal Malaysian Air Force]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Sultan Ahmad Shah (Kuantan)|url=http://www.klia.com.my/index.php?m=business&c=business_about&id=9|website=www.klia.com.my|publisher=Malaysia Airports Holdings Berhad|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2017}}</ref> Kuantan is also home to Pahang's only [[seaport]], the [[Kuantan Port]]. The multipurpose seaport, that handles both [[intermodal container]]s and [[bulk cargo]], is an important gateway of the international sea trading routes for the entire east coast region of Peninsular Malaysia. Since 2013, the port embarked on massive expansion program with the development of New Deep Water Terminal consisting 2&nbsp;km berth extension, to be fully integrated with the Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park (MCKIP) and other neighbouring industrial parks within the Special Economic Zone. This expansion plan, along with other high impact development projects are in tandem with the escalating economic development of the Eastern Industrial Corridor.<ref name="ECERDC"/>

=== Healthcare ===
{{see also|List of hospitals in Malaysia}}
[[File:Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital.JPG|thumbnail|The [[Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital]] in Kuantan.]]
Pahang population has benefited from a well- developed [[Healthcare in Malaysia|Malaysian health care system]], good access to clean water and sanitation, and strong social and economic programmes. Health care services consist of tax-funded and federal government-run primary health care centres and hospitals, and fast-growing private services mainly located in physician clinics and hospitals in urban areas. [[Infant mortality rate]] per 1000 live births, a standard in determining the overall efficiency of healthcare, in 2010 was 7.6.<ref name="MOH Indicators2"/> As of national figure, infant mortality fell from 75 per 1000 live births in 1957 to 7 in 2013.<ref>{{harvnb|Britnell|2015|p=36}}</ref> Life expectancy at birth in 2016 was 70.8 years for male and 76.3 years for female.<ref name="DOSM Pahang"/>

The public healthcare system in Pahang is provided by five specialist government hospitals;<ref>{{cite web|title=Hospital|url=http://jknpahang.moh.gov.my/index.php/perkhidmatan/fasiliti-kesihatan/hospital|website=jknpahang.moh.gov.my|publisher=Pahang State Health Department|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2016}}</ref> [[Tengku Ampuan Afzan Hospital]], [[Sultan Haji Ahmad Shah Hospital]], Bentong Hospital, Kuala Lipis Hospital and Pekan Hospital, as well as other district hospitals, public health clinics, [[1Malaysia#1Malaysia clinics|1Malaysia clinics]], and rural clinics. There are several private hospitals in Pahang, including Kuantan Medical Centre, KPJ Pahang Specialist Hospital, Darul Makmur Medical Centre, PRKMUIP Specialist Hospital and KCDC Hospital. The IIUM Medical Centre located in [[Bandar Indera Mahkota]], is a government-funded [[teaching hospital]] managed by [[Kulliyyah of Medicine]], [[International Islamic University Malaysia]]. For outpatient treatment, general practitioners are available at private-owned clinics which are easily accessible in most housing estates.<ref>{{cite web|title=Medical Care|url=http://www.investinpahang.gov.my/index.php?ch=en_whypahang&pg=en_livingpahang&ac=2|website=www.investinpahang.gov.my|publisher=Pahang State Development Corporation|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2012}}</ref> The availability of affordable advanced medical services had benefited the state directly from the booming Malaysian [[medical tourism]].

Public health system is financed mainly through general revenue and taxation collected by the federal government, while the private sector is funded principally through out-of-pocket payments from patients and some private health insurance. There is still, however, a significant shortage in the medical workforce, especially of highly trained specialists; thus, certain medical care and treatment are available only in large towns. Recent efforts to bring many facilities to other towns have been hampered by lack of expertise to run the available equipment. As a result, secondary care is offered in smaller public medical facilities in suburbs and rural areas, while more complex tertiary care is available in regional and national hospitals in urban areas like [[Temerloh]] and [[Kuantan]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Malaysia Health System Review|url=http://www.wpro.who.int/asia_pacific_observatory/hits/series/Malaysia_Health_Systems_Review2013.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327193634/http://www.wpro.who.int/asia_pacific_observatory/hits/series/Malaysia_Health_Systems_Review2013.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=27 March 2014|website=www.wpro.who.int|publisher=World Health Organization - Western Pacific Region|access-date=29 October 2017|year=2013}}</ref>

About 95% of the population are Malaysian citizens. Malaysian citizens are divided along ethnic lines, with 75% considered ''[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputera]]''. The largest group of ''bumiputera'' that make up 70% of Pahang population, are [[Malaysian Malays|Malays]], who are defined in the constitution as Muslims who practice Malay customs and culture. They play a dominant role politically. ''Bumiputera'' status is also accorded to certain non-Malay indigenous peoples that make up 5% of the population, in particular the aboriginal groups known as [[Orang Asli]]. Other non-Malay indigenous peoples also include ethnic Thais, Khmers, Chams and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak. 15.3% of the population are of [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese descent]], while those of [[Malaysian Indian|Indian descent]] comprise 4% of the population.<ref name="DOSM Population by State"/> The presence of Chinese miner-merchants was recorded since the time of the old [[Pahang Sultanate]],<ref name="Linehan 1973 31"/> and the community have historically been dominant in the business and commerce community. Immigrants from India, the majority of them [[Tamil people|Tamils]] and began arriving in large numbers during British protectorate at the end of the 19th century. Every citizen is issued a biometric smart chip [[identity document|identity card]] known as ''[[MyKad]]'' at the age of 12, and must carry the card at all times.

In 1957, a large majority of the population resided in rural areas with urbanisation rate stood at only 22.2%.<ref>{{cite web|author1=Tarmiji Masron|author2=Usman Yaakub|author3=Fujimaki Masami|title=Population Growth and Urbanisation in Peninsular Malaysia from 1911 to 2000|url=http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/re/k-rsc/hss/book/pdf/vol06_08.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/re/k-rsc/hss/book/pdf/vol06_08.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live|website=www.ritsumei.ac.jp|publisher=Institute of Humanities, Human and Social Sciences, Ritsumeikan University|access-date=1 November 2017|page=119}}</ref> The urbanisation had increased significantly but relatively at a lower rate compared to other states, owing to its large agricultural lands.

[[File:Siti Nurhaliza - KLIFF 08.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Siti Nurhaliza]], a popular singer from Pahang, performing in traditional Malay dress. Malays are the dominant ethnicity in Pahang.]]
As a multiracial country, Malaysia is home to many ethnic groups. In 2016, it is ranked 59th most ethnically diverse countries in the world with index at 0.596. However, ethnic diversity is not equally distributed among its states and territories. Pahang is categorised as medium ethnically diverse state with 0.36 of ethnic diversity index in 2010. It is ranked 5th least diverse among Malaysian states and territories, after Terengganu, Kelantan, Malacca and Perlis. The least ethnically diverse districts are [[Pekan]], [[Rompin]] and [[Temerloh]] (index between 0.1 and 0.39), and the most ethnically diverse districts are [[Bentong]] and [[Raub, Pahang|Raub]] (index between 0.49 and 0.59) where minorities form significant proportion of the population. Ethnic diversity in Pahang was historically high, at an index between 0.5 and 0.6 in the 1970s, but showing a downward trend decades later, largely caused by outward migration, high birth rate of the majority population and the opening up of new agricultural lands particularly the [[Federal Land Development Authority|FELDA]] settlements, that attract many immigrants from other Malaysian states.<ref name="Evers">{{cite web|last=Evers|first=Hans-Dieter|title=Changing Ethnic Diversity in Peninsular Malaysia|url=http://web.usm.my/km/32(1)2014/KM%2032(1)%202014%20-%20ART%202%20(37-53).pdf

The most dominant ethnic group are [[Malaysian Malays|Malays]] that make up 70% of Pahang population, who are defined in the constitution as Muslims who practice Malay customs and culture. The Malays in turn, can be further divided into several [[sub-ethnic group]]s, of which the most dominant are the [[Pahang Malays]]. Historically, the community can be found in the vast riverine systems of Pahang and are prominently featured in the state's history. There are also small Pahang Malay communities in the valley of the Lebir River in [[Kelantan]] and the upper portions of several rivers near the [[Perak]] and [[Selangor]] boundaries, descendants of fugitives from the [[Pahang Civil War|civil war]] that ravaged their homeland in the 19th century.<ref>{{harvnb|Linehan|1973|pp=89}}</ref> The [[Terengganuan Malay people|Terengganuan Malays]], another east coast sub-ethnicity, are native to narrow strip of sometimes discontiguous fishermen villages and towns along the coastline of Pahang.<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|1989|pp=258}}</ref> Other important Malay sub-ethnicities include the [[Kelantanese Malay people|Kelantanese]] and [[Kedahan Malay people|Kedahans]], that migrated from [[Kelantan]] and [[Kedah]] respectively, and can be found in major urban centres and agricultural settlements.

The Malays are collectively referred as ''[[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|bumiputera]]'' along with other non-Malay indigenous people that constitutes about 5% of the state's population. The community of [[Orang Asli]] form the most dominant non-Malay indigenous group. According to 2010 census, Pahang has the largest Orang Asli population in Malaysia with 64,000 people, followed by Perak with 42,841 people.<ref>{{cite web|author=Haris Fadilah Ahmad|title=Keunikan suku kaum Orang Asli Pahang|url=http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Pahang/20120612/wp_01/Keunikan-suku-kaum-Orang-Asli-Pahang|website=www.utusan.com.my|publisher=[[Utusan Malaysia]]|access-date=1 November 2017|date=12 June 2012|archive-date=19 March 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170319052204/http://ww1.utusan.com.my/utusan/Pahang/20120612/wp_01/Keunikan-suku-kaum-Orang-Asli-Pahang|url-status=dead}}</ref> The Orang Asli in Pahang is grouped into 3 large groups; [[Negrito]], [[Senoi]] and [[Proto Malay]]. Approximately 40% of them live close to or within forested areas, and engage in swiddening as well as hunting and gathering of forest products. Some also practise permanent agriculture and manage their own rubber, oil palm, or cocoa farms. A very small number, especially among the Negrito groups, are still semi-nomadic and depend on the seasonal bounties of the forest. Due to sweeping modernisation, a fair number of them are to be found in urban areas surviving on their waged or salaried jobs. The three groups of Orang Asli can be divided further into several smaller tribes that traditionally domiciled in certain geographical part of Pahang. The [[Batek people|Bateq]] tribe of Negrito group can be found in northern part of Pahang. Two Senoi tribes, [[Semaq Beri people|Semaq Beri]] and [[Semai people|Semai]] are also domiciled in northern Pahang. Two other Senoi tribes, [[Chewong]] and [[Jah Hut people|Jah Hut]] communities can be found in central Pahang. Meanwhile, the southern part of the state is dominated by Proto Malay tribes of [[Jakun people|Jakun]], [[Temoq people|Temoq]], [[Semelai people|Semelai]] and [[Temuan]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Tarmiji Masron|author2=Fujimaki Masami|author3=Norhasimah Ismail|title=Orang Asli in Peninsular Malaysia : Population, Spatial Distribution and Socio-Economic Condition|url=http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/re/k-rsc/hss/book/pdf/vol06_07.pdf|website=www.ritsumei.ac.jp|publisher=Institute of Humanities, Human and Social Sciences, Ritsumeikan University|access-date=3 November 2017|year=2013|pages=80–90}}</ref>

The minorities consist of [[Malaysian Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Malaysian Indian|Indians]] form collectively about 19.5% of the population. They are descendants of immigrants from China and India that came in large numbers during British protectorate to work in the mines, rubber plantations and various services sector. They are primarily concentrated in the western districts of Raub and Bentong and other urban areas.

The Malay language spoken in Pahang can be further divided into several varieties of Malay dialects. [[Pahang Malay]] is the most dominant Malay dialect spoken along the vast riverine systems of Pahang, but it co-exists with other Malay dialects traditionally spoken in the state. Along the coastline of Pahang, [[Terengganu Malay]] is spoken in a narrow strip of sometimes discontiguous fishermen villages and towns. Another dialect spoken in [[Tioman Island]] is a distinct Malay variant and most closely related to Riau Archipelago Malay subdialect spoken in [[Natuna]] and [[Anambas islands]] in the South China Sea, together forming a dialect continuum between the Bornean Malay with the Mainland Peninsular/Sumatran Malay. [[Kelantan Malay|Kelantanese]] and [[Kedah Malay|Kedahan]], along with other Malay dialects are also spoken by immigrants from other Malaysian states.

Pahang is also home to majority of [[Orang Asli]] languages, mostly belong to [[Aslian languages|Aslian]] branch of [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] such as [[Semai language|Semai]], [[Batek language|Batek]], [[Semoq Beri language|Semoq Beri]], [[Jah Hut language|Jah Hut]], [[Temoq language|Temoq]], [[Che' Wong language|Che Wong]], [[Semelai language|Semelai]] (although recognised as "[[Proto-Malay]]"), [[Temiar language|Temiar]] and [[Mendriq language|Mendriq]]. Besides Austroasiatic, Proto-Malay languages that is a branch of [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] are also spoken, mostly [[Temuan language|Temuan]] and [[Jakun language|Jakun]].

Malaysian Chinese predominantly speak Chinese dialects from the southern provinces of China. The more common [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese varieties]] in the country are [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Hokkien]], [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], [[Cantonese]], [[Hainanese]] and [[Fuzhou dialect|Fuzhou]].

[[Tamil language|Tamil]] is used predominantly by Tamils, who form a majority of Malaysian Indians.

== Culture ==
[[File:Pahang House1.jpg|thumb|left|The traditional ''Serambi'' house of Pahang.]]
As a less ethnically diverse state, the traditional culture of Pahang is largely predominated by the [[Bumiputera (Malaysia)|indigenous]] culture, of both Malays and Orang Asli. Both cultures trace their origin from the early settlers in the state that consist primarily from both various [[Malayic languages|Malayic]] speaking [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesians]] and Mon-Khmer speaking [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic]] tribes.<ref>{{harvnb|Benjamin|p=83}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Farish A Noor|2011|pp=15–16}}</ref> Around the opening of the common era, [[Mahayana Buddhism]] was introduced to the region, where it flourished with the establishment of a [[Old Pahang Kingdom|Buddhist state]] from the 5th century.<ref name="Guy 2014 29"/> Malayic cultures flourished during [[Srivijaya]]n era, and [[Malayisation]] intensified after Pahang was established as a [[Pahang Sultanate|Malay-Muslim Sultanate]] in 1470. The development of many Malay-dominated centres in the state, drew some of the natives to embrace [[Malayness]] by converting to Islam, emulating the Malay speech and their dress.<ref>{{harvnb|Andaya|Andaya|1984|p=50}}</ref> [[Pahang Malays]] share similar cultural traits with other sub-groups of [[Malay people]] native to the Malay Peninsula. They are in particular closely affiliated to peoples of the east coast of the peninsula like [[Thai Malays]], [[Terengganuan Malay people|Terengganuan Malays]] and [[Kelantanese Malay people|Kelantanese Malays]].<ref>{{harvnb|Collins|1989|pp=253–254}}</ref>

Unlike the relatively homogeneous Malay culture, the cultural features Orang Asli are represented by significantly diverse tribal identities. Prior to the 1960, the various indigenous groups did not consciously adopt a common ethnic marker to differentiate themselves from the Malays. The label 'Orang Asli' itself was historically came from the British. Each tribe has its own language and culture, and perceives itself as different from the others.
