'''Salmiya''' ({{Langx|ar|السالمية|translit=As-Sālmīya(h)}}) is an [[Areas of Kuwait|area]] in [[Hawalli Governorate]] in [[Kuwait]].

Salmiya is administratively divided into 12 blocks. The blocks located closer to the interior of the district tend to be mostly residential, while those located beside the Persian Gulf coastline have a great deal of commercial and up-scale residential real estate. The interior residential areas boast a huge population of foreigners consisting mainly of those from the Indian sub-continent and other Arabs who are not native to the [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf|Persian Gulf]] area. Approximately, two-thirds of the district's population reside in blocks 8 to 12. These blocks are highly desirable among the residents due to its urban amenities and the well-designed infrastructure, including the city's public works and built environment, enhances the overall quality of life for its residents.

==Facilities==

Salmiya hosts numerous museums, [[mosques]], an [[aquarium]], a Scientific Center, [[IMAX]] movie theaters, football stadium, medical centers, a Roman Catholic Chapel, the district passport office ("Jawazat") and a well-equipped park beside the 5th Ring Road. Notable malls include the [[Salmiya Souq]] Mega-mall which was the first mall in the nation, Marina Mall in the Marina World shopping and entertainment district, and the [[Omniya mall|Omariya mall]]. The Gulf Road is coveted for its amazing sea vistas and is the main hub for new construction of future buildings and renovations. A boulevard passing through much of coastal Salmiya is a reflection of Kuwait's drive to modernity.

The Salem Al-Mubarak Street shopping district, commonly known as Salmiya Center, runs down the outer blocks of Salmiya. It is one of the oldest and largest shopping districts of [[Kuwait]]. It is a remnant of Kuwait's once numerous traditional souk bazaars, similar to the ones located in [[Jleeb Al-Shuyoukh]] and the centre Kuwait City. Well known in the past for [[pearls]], [[gold]] and [[jewellery]], it now consists of a wide array of retail giants and local outlets. Much of the old souk had been built over, but the feel and atmosphere of the past albeit remains visible at the traditional precincts of this shopping district. The experience varies from modernized (and Westernized) in the strip malls, to a true [[Kuwait]]i experience on some of the back streets. It is notable to point out that the more eastward away from the capital one moves along the strip, the fancier and pricier the shops are in general. There are many [[gold]] and fabric shops in the "Old [[Souk]]" area located onwards from the intersection of the 4th Ring Road and the strip.

==History==
Salmiya has been a model district in the context of modernization. It has undertaken a major face lift in recent times primarily due to ever-expanding commercial real estate on the Gulf Road. The popular Salem Al-Mubarak Shopping strip is in relative close proximity to the capital. The boom in real estate in Salmiya has seen its demographics being constantly on the move. Increasing rental prices have gradually pushed out its working class expatriate community towards the interior districts of Kuwait.

The influx of foreigners to Salmiya is of historical importance dating as far back as the 1960s. During the [[Gulf War]] Salmiya was destroyed by invading Iraqi occupation, but from 1993 onward it was gradually rebuilt and re-populated. The old rugged 3-storied buildings and open fields, which Salmiya was famous for, have given way to high density layouts of high-rise apartments and complexes. The beach front, once a hub and harbor for the fishing and [[pearl diving]] community, has been transformed into a well-developed and modern bustling commercial avenue. Salmiya is also one of the most expensive area for real estate in the country.

== Sport ==
Salmiya is home to the [[Thamir Stadium]], which belongs to [[Al-Salmiya SC|Al Salmiya Club]].
Construction has begun on a [[cricket ground]], which once completed will be of [[One Day International]] standard.  It is hoped the facility will help develop cricket in Kuwait, as well as luring international teams to play neutral matches there.  The ground is due for completion in 2012.<ref>[http://www.asiancricket.org/index.php/news/september-2010/1859 Kuwait: 2012 for ODI ground]</ref>

== Transportation ==
