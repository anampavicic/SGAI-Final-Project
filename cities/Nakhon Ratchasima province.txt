The capital of the province is [[Nakhon Ratchasima|the city of Nakhon Ratchasima]] in [[Mueang Nakhon Ratchasima district]], also called ''Khorat''.

==Geography==
[[File:Khaoyai panorama2.jpg|left|370px|thumb|[[Khao Yai National Park]]]]
The province is at the west end of the [[Khorat Plateau]], separated from the [[Chao Phraya]] river valley by the [[Phetchabun mountains|Phetchabun]] and [[Dong Phaya Yen mountains|Dong Phaya Yen]] mountain ranges. Two [[National parks (Thailand)|national parks]] are in the province: Khao Yai in the west and Thap Lan in the south. Both parks are in the forested mountains of the [[Sankamphaeng Range]], the southern prolongation of the Dong Phaya Yen mountains. The total forest area is {{convert|3,193|km²|abbr=on}} or 15.4 percent of provincial area.<ref name="RFD"/>

Nakhon Ratchasima is a large province on the northeastern plateau and acts as a gateway to other provinces in the northeast.  It is {{convert|259|km}} from Bangkok and has an area of around {{convert|20,494|km2}}. The province is rich in Khmer culture and has a long history.

===National parks===
There are two national parks, along with two other national parks, make up [[Protected Areas Regional Offices of Thailand|region 1 (Prachinburi)]] of Thailand's protected areas.

==History==
[[File:ปราสาทหินพิมาย (PHIMAI).jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Phimai historical park]]]]
The area around Khorat was already an important centre in the times of the [[Khmer empire]] in the 11th century, as can be seen by the temple ruins in [[Phimai historical park]]. Nakhon Ratchasima province is one of the provinces where there is still a sizable [[Northern Khmer people|northern Khmer]] population.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=83 |title=Thai People In Northeastern Thailand (Isan) |access-date=2011-09-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811192411/http://www.thailandsworld.com/index.cfm?p=83 |archive-date=2014-08-11 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

A new walled city with a surrounding moat, designated as Nakhon Ratchasima, was built in the 17th century by order of the King [[Narai]], as the easternmost "command post", guarding the kingdom's border. Nakhon Ratchasima continued this duty during the Bangkok Period, although it was briefly seized during [[Lao rebellion (1826–1828)]] in 1826, in the reign of King [[Rama III]] of Siam.

Nakhon Ratchasima has long been the most important political and economic centre in the northeastern region. In the late-19th century, the railroad reached Khorat and it became the junction of two main rail lines in the northeastern, Isan, region. In 1933, Nakhon Ratchasima was the stronghold of the royalist troops in the [[Boworadet Rebellion]], as they fought against the new democratic government in Bangkok. In the 1950s, the [[Korat Royal Thai Air Force Base]] was built in Nakhon Ratchasima; from 1961 until 26 February 1976, this facility was also used as a base by the [[United States Air Force]].

A [[mass shooting]] [[Nakhon Ratchasima shootings|occurred]] in the province on 8 and 9 February 2020. The gunman killed 30 and wounded another 57 before being shot dead by police. It was the deadliest mass shooting in [[Thailand]]'s history.

Nakhon Ratchasima was the birthplace of [[Thao Suranari]] who was born in 1771 and was the savior of Nakhon Ratchasima from King [[wikt:เจ้า|Chao]] [[Anouvong]]'s army in 1826.

==Symbols==
[[File:Yamo-and-Chomphon-Gate.JPG|thumb|250x250px|Thao Suranari Monument]]

The [[Seals of the provinces of Thailand|provincial seal]] depicts the revered heroine of Khorat, [[Thao Suranari]] (Thai: ท้าวสุรนารี).

A monument to Thao Suranari (real name: ''Khunying Mo''; 1771–1852) stands in front of the old ''Pratu Chumphon'' gate. Also called "The Great Heroine of Khorat", Kunying Mo was the wife of the Siamese-appointed deputy governor of Nakhon Ratchasima during the reign of King Rama III. In 1826, Khunying Mo managed to repel the [[Laos|Lao]]tian army led by Prince [[Anouvong]] of [[Vientiane]] who tried to reinstate control over the Khorat plateau. King [[Rama III]] conferred the title of ''Thao Suranari'' on Khunying Mo, as well as additional ones honouring her bravery.

The [[list of Thai provincial trees|provincial tree]] and flower is the ''sathon'' (''[[Millettia leucantha]]''). The provincial aquatic animal is [[Hoven's carp]] (''Leptobarbus hoevenii'').

The provincial motto is "Land of brave women, fine silk material, Khorat rice noodles, [[Phimai Historical Park]], and Dan Kwian ceramics".

The provincial color is orange

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
[[File:Amphoe Nakhon Ratchasima.svg|thumb|320px|Nakhon Ratchasima with 32 districts]]

*[[Phimai Historical Park]] is one of the most important Khmer temples of Thailand. It is in the town of Phimai. The temple marks one end of the ancient Khmer Highway from Angkor. As the enclosed area of 1020 x 580 metres is comparable to that of Angkor Wat, Phimai must have been an important city in the Khmer Empire. Most buildings date from the late-11th to the late-12th century, built in the Baphuon, Bayon, and Angkor Wat styles. However, even though the Khmer at that time were [[Hindu]], the temple was built as a Buddhist temple, since the inhabitants of the Khorat area had been Buddhists as far back the 7th century. Inscriptions name the site ''Vimayapura'', which developed into the Thai name ''Phimai''.
*[[Khao Yai National Park]] is in the western part of the Sankamphaeng Mountain Range, at the southwestern boundary of the [[Khorat Plateau]]. The highest mountain in the area of the park is 1,351 m high Khao Rom. This park lies largely in Nakhon Ratchasima province (Khorat), but also includes parts of Saraburi, Prachinburi, and Nakhon Nayok provinces. The park is the third largest in Thailand. It covers an area of 300 square kilometers, including tropical seasonal forests and grasslands. Elevations mostly range from 400 to 1,000 m. It is home to 3,000 species of plants and 320 species of birds. Waterfalls include the 80 metre Heo Narok, and Heo Suwat .

==Korat cat==
{{Main|Korat}}
[[File:Korat in cat show-cropped.JPG|thumb|180px|[[Korat|Korat Cat]] (si sawat)]]

({{langx|th|โคราช, มาเลศ, สีสวาด}}, {{RTGS|Khorat, malet, si sawat}})

The Korat cat is a [[natural breed]], and one of the oldest stable cat breeds. Originating in Nakhon Ratchasima province at [[Phimai]],<ref name="BP-20161106">{{cite news|last1=Na Thalang|first1=Jeerawat|title=Splitting hairs over cat breeds|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/special-reports/1127997/splitting-hairs-over-cat-breeds|access-date=8 November 2016|work=Bangkok Post|date=6 November 2016}}</ref> it is named after its province of origin. In Thailand the breed is known as ''si sawat'', meaning "colour of the [[Caesalpinia|sawat seed]]" (bluish-gray). Korat cats are distinguished not only by the colour of their fur. Genuine Korat cats have a heart-shaped face when viewed from any angle and shorter grey hair with silver tips. The true breed's eyes are yellow with an inner green circle. They must be slender and agile. The cat's tail must be slender. Cats with crooked tails are considered inauspicious.<ref name="BP-20161106" />

In 1965, Korat cats were first registered in the US by the Korat Cat Fanciers Association. The cats that formed the breed were first imported from Thailand by Jean L. Johnson in 1959. In 1966 the breed was accepted by the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA). The Korat breed is now accepted by cat associations around the world.<ref name="BP-20161106" />

The International Maew Boran Association (TIMBA) ("maew boran" means "ancient cat") was formed in Thailand to provide a registry of and pedigrees for Thai cats, including Korats,  and to provide a voice in English for Thai breeders as "...Thai breeders...do not speak English, and [[farang]] breeders do not speak Thai.".<ref>{{cite web|title=Welcome to TIMBA|url=http://www.timba.org/welcome-to-timba.html|website=TIMBA: The International Maew Boran Association|access-date=10 November 2016}}</ref><ref name="BP-20161106" />
