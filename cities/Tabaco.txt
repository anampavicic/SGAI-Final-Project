'''Tabaco''', officially the '''City of Tabaco''' ({{langx|bcl|Syudad kan Tabaco}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Tabaco}}), is a 4th class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Albay]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 140,961 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is one of the three [[Cities of the Philippines|component cities]] of the province, along with [[Legazpi, Albay|Legazpi]] and [[Ligao]]. The mainland part of the city is bordered by the town of [[Malinao, Albay|Malinao]] to the north, the towns of [[Polangui, Albay|Polangui]] and [[Oas, Albay|Oas]] to the west, Ligao to the southwest, [[Malilipot, Albay|Malilipot]] town to the southeast, and [[Lagonoy Gulf]] to the east.<ref name="Fortune"/> The symmetric [[Mayon Volcano]], the most [[List of active volcanoes in the Philippines|active volcano]] in the Philippines, lies south of the city. Tabaco is one of the eight towns and cities that share jurisdiction on the volcano, dividing the peak like slices of a pie when viewed from above.

The island of [[San Miguel Island, Albay|San Miguel]], the westernmost of the four main islands in Lagonoy Gulf, falls under the jurisdiction of Tabaco. Five of the [[barangay]]s of the city are located on the island for a total of 47 [[barangay]]s composing the city.<ref>[http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/municipality.asp?muncode=050517000&regcode=05&provcode=05 "City of Tabaco"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527204726/http://www.nscb.gov.ph/activestats/psgc/municipality.asp?muncode=050517000&regcode=05&provcode=05 |date=May 27, 2012 }}.

==Etymology==
According to native stories, the "Legend of Tabaco" was about a lost foreigner who asked the locals what the name of the place is. However a confused and frightened native whom the lost foreigner asked didn't understand what the lost foreigner was asking. The native screamed "Tabak ko!" meaning "My bolo" insinuating a person to get his tabak (presumably for defense). The lost foreigner assumed that the native understood what he asked, then thought the name of the place is Tabaco.

The Official Seal of the city was still conceived from the "''Tabak Ko''" legend and was officially adopted through Municipal Council Resolution No. 29 on February 23, 1966.

==History==
===Spanish period===
According to the ''Estado Geografico Estadistico Historico'' written in 1805 by Father De Huerta, the recorded history of the city began in 1587 through the [[missionary work]] of the first [[Franciscan]] Fathers. In 1616, Fr. Pedro De Alcareso became the first permanent parish priest and established a [[parish church|church]] dedicated to [[St. John the Baptist]], the [[patron saint]] of the city.<ref name="Historical">[http://www.tabacocity.com.ph/Tourism/LocalHeritage.php "Historical Tabaco"]. Tabaco City Official Website. Retrieved on April 20, 2012.</ref>

The first inhabitants settled along the seashore and engaged in fishing and crude farming. Due to the continuous attacks by the [[Moro people|Moro]] raiders, the natives migrated to San Vicente and San Carlos, and started the foundation of the first [[poblacion]] in 1703, while the fishermen of the town transferred to the shores of the bay of what is now known as [[Barangay]] Cormidal. Under the administration of the first town executive, a church was built in Cormidal in 1731. Records on the elected ''Capitan municipal'' (town mayor) started only in 1731 with Martin Aguirre listed as the first mayor of Tabaco.<ref name="Fortune"/>

In 1811, a terrible [[typhoon]] called Baguiong Oguis or White Typhoon brought havoc to the town. This was followed in 1814 by the most destructive eruption of the [[Mayon Volcano]], which showered the areas with ashes and stone. These two events rendered many residents homeless and left the fields unproductive for many years after. It took a full decade for the people to recover, at which time they built a cemetery and laid the foundation of the present church which was completed in 17 years.<ref name="Historical"/>

===American period and independence===
The Americans landed at Tabaco on February 9, 1900, under the command of Col. Walter Howe. Despite the well-documented courage and [[patriotism]] of the Tabaqueños, the residents of Tabaco, the superior armaments and well-trained soldiers of the [[U.S. Army|American army]] hastened its conquest of Tabaco and adjoining towns, starting the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American rule]] in the area.<ref name="Historical"/>

With the restoration of peace after World War II, the Tabaqueños started rebuilding their lives and their land. By the time the Philippines gained [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|independence]] in 1946, Tabaco was once again a thriving town.<ref name="Historical"/>

===Other catastrophic events===
Another catastrophe to hit the town was [[Typhoon Trix (1952)|Typhoon Trix]] in 1952, which completely submerged [[Natunawan Island]]. A 1964 fire razed the commercial center, and in 1970, another destructive storm, [[Typhoon Joan (1970)|Typhoon Sening]], slashed through the town.<ref name="Fortune">{{cite web |url=http://oasis.fortunecity.com/acapulco/215/region5/albay/tabaco.htm |title=Tabaco Town, Albay Province, Region V, Philippines |access-date=December 17, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711020815/http://oasis.fortunecity.com/acapulco/215/region5/albay/tabaco.htm |archive-date=July 11, 2011 }}</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
Then Representative Krisel Lagman-Luistro introduced House Bill No. 7851, upgrading the municipality of Tabaco into a [[Cities of the Philippines|component city]] of the Province of Albay. Senate Bill No. 2244 was sponsored by Senators [[Sergio Osmeña III]] and [[Franklin Drilon]] as its counterpart in the Senate. The Republic Act No. 9020 converted the Municipality of Tabaco into a [[Cities of the Philippines#Classification|component city]] of the Province of Albay. It was signed into law by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] on February 5, 2001. The municipality was finally converted into a city after the plebiscite conducted on March 4, 2001.

===Language and dialect===
[[Coastal Bikol languages|Bicolano]] is the primary language in Tabaco and the region. The majority of people speak the Tabaqueño Dialect derived from Coastal Bicol. Although Bicolano Viejo is also spoken, it has fallen out of mainstream use and has since been reduced to the status of sociolect as only very few members of Tabaco's oldest and more affluent families still use it. As in most parts of the Philippines, Filipino and English are spoken and afforded official language status. Spanish, Hiligaynon, Cebuano, Arabic, Cantonese, Hokkien and Mandarin are also spoken owing to Tabaco's significant migrant and mestizo populations.

===Religion===
[[Christianity]] is the predominant religion with [[Roman Catholicism]] with the most number of practitioners. Other Christian denominations are also present in the city like [[Protestants]], [[Baptist]], [[Philippine Independent Church]], [[United Pentecostal Church]], [[Evangelical Christian]] and [[Iglesia ni Cristo]]. [[Islam]], [[Mormonism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Jainism]], [[Wicca]], [[Modern Paganism]] and [[Buddhism]] also have followers in the city.
