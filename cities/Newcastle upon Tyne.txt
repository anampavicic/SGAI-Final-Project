==History==
{{Main|History of Newcastle upon Tyne}}

===Roman===
The first recorded settlement in what is now Newcastle was [[Pons Aelius]] ("[[Hadrian]]'s bridge"), a Roman fort and bridge across the [[River Tyne]]. It was given the family name of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]], who founded it in the 2nd century AD. This rare honour suggests Hadrian may have visited the site and instituted the bridge on his tour of Britain. The population of Pons Aelius then is estimated at 2,000. Fragments of [[Hadrian's Wall]] are visible in parts of Newcastle, particularly along the West Road. The course of the "Roman Wall" can be traced eastwards to the [[Segedunum]] [[Castra|Roman fort]] in [[Wallsend]] – the "wall's end" – and to the separate supply fort of [[Arbeia]] in [[South Shields]], across the river from Hadrian's Wall.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arbeiaromanfort.org.uk/ |title=Arbeia Roman Fort |access-date=25 March 2018}}</ref>

The extent of Hadrian's Wall was {{convert|73|mi|km}}, spanning the width of Britain; the Wall incorporated the [[Vallum (Hadrian's Wall)|Vallum]], a large rearward ditch with parallel mounds,<ref>{{cite web |author=The Megalithic Portal and Megalith Map |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18177 |title=C.Michael Hogan (2007) ''Hadrian's Wall'', ed. A. Burnham, The Megalithic Portal |publisher=Megalithic.co.uk |access-date=4 August 2010}}</ref> and was built primarily for defence and to prevent the incursion of [[Pict]]ish tribes from the north, and probably not as a fighting line for a major invasion. However, it seems that the Vallum stopped just west of Newcastle, where its role as a secondary line of defence was performed by the [[River Tyne]].<ref>Stephen Johnson (2004) ''Hadrian's Wall'', Sterling Publishing Company, Inc, 128 pages, {{ISBN|0-7134-8840-9}}</ref>
[[File:Newcastle schloss.jpg|thumb|upright|[[The Castle, Newcastle|Newcastle Castle]] [[Keep]] is the oldest structure in the city, dating back to at least the 11th century.]]

===Anglo-Saxon and Norman===
After the [[End of Roman rule in Britain|Roman departure from Britain]], completed in 410, Newcastle became part of the powerful [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]] kingdom of [[Northumbria]], and was known throughout this period as ''Munucceaster'' (sometimes modernised as ''Monkchester'').<ref name=Monkchester>{{cite web | last = Mackenzie | first = Eneas | title = ''Historical Account of Newcastle-upon-Tyne'' | website = british-history.ac.uk | year = 1827 | url = http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=43318 | access-date = 24 November 2008}}</ref>

From 1530, a royal act restricted all shipments of coal from [[Tyneside]] to [[Newcastle Quayside]], giving a monopoly in the coal trade to a cartel of Newcastle burgesses known as the [[The Hostmen of Newcastle-upon-Tyne|Hostmen]]. This monopoly, which lasted for a considerable time, helped Newcastle prosper and develop into a major town.

In the 18th century, the American entrepreneur [[Timothy Dexter]], regarded as an eccentric, defied this idiom.

==Geography==
[[File:Side - Tyne Bridge.jpg|thumb|right|Side, a street in Newcastle near the Tyne Bridge]]
Since 1974, Newcastle has been a part of the [[metropolitan county]] of [[Tyne and Wear]] in [[North East England]]. The city is located on the north-western bank of the [[River Tyne]], approximately {{convert|46|mile}} south of the border with Scotland.
 
The ground beneath the city is formed from [[Carboniferous]] [[Stratum|strata]] of the Middle Pennine Coal Measures Group — a suite of [[sandstone]]s, [[mudstone]]s and [[coal seam]]s which generally dip moderately eastwards. To the west of the city are the Upper Pennine Coal Measures and further west again the sandstones and mudstones of the Stainmore Formation, the local equivalent of the [[Millstone Grit]].<ref>''Bedrock Geology UK North'', 1:625,000 scale geological map published by British Geological Survey</ref>

In large parts, Newcastle still retains a [[medieval]] street layout. Narrow alleys or '[[chare]]s', most of which can only be traversed by foot, still exist in abundance, particularly around the [[Quayside|riverside]]. Stairs from the riverside to higher parts of the city centre and the extant [[Newcastle Castle Keep|Castle Keep]], originally recorded in the 14th century, remain intact in places. Close, Sandhill and [[Quayside]] contain modern buildings as well as structures dating from the 15th–18th centuries, including [[Bessie Surtees House]], the Cooperage and Lloyds Quayside Bars, Derwentwater House and House of Tides, a restaurant situated at a Grade I-listed 16th century merchant's house at 28–30 Close.

The city has an extensive [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] centre referred to as Tyneside Classical,<ref name="Tyneside Classical">{{cite web

The development of the city in the 1960s saw the demolition of part of [[Grainger Town]] as a prelude to the modernist rebuilding initiatives of [[T. Dan Smith]], the leader of [[Newcastle City Council]]. A corruption scandal was uncovered involving Smith and [[John Poulson]], a [[Real estate developer|property developer]] from [[Pontefract]], West Yorkshire, and both were imprisoned. Echoes of the scandal were revisited in the late 1990s in the [[BBC TV]] mini-series, ''[[Our Friends in the North]]''.<ref>Flannery, Peter. ''Retrospective – An interview with the creators of the series''. Included as a bonus feature on the ''[[Our Friends in the North]]'' DVD release. (BMG DVD 74321 941149).</ref>

Newcastle's thriving [[Chinatown, Newcastle|Chinatown]] lies in the north-west of [[Grainger Town]], centred on Stowell Street. A new Chinese arch, or ''[[paifang]]'', providing a landmark entrance, was handed over to the city with a ceremony in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/whats-on/food-drink-news/chinese-new-year-2015-newcastle-8518677|title=Chinese New Year 2015 Newcastle: Guide to shops and restaurants in Chinatown|first=Sarah |last=Jeffery|date=26 January 2015|work=nechronicle}}</ref>

===Housing===
The [[Tyneside flat]] was the dominant housing form constructed at the time when the industrial centres on Tyneside were growing most rapidly. They can still be found in areas such as South Heaton in Newcastle but once dominated the streetscape on both sides of the Tyne.<ref>{{cite web|title=Heaton (HMOs & Tyneside flats)|url=https://newcastleareas.wordpress.com/heaton-tyneside-flats/|website=Newcastle residential areas|date=28 December 2012|access-date=10 January 2016}}</ref> Tyneside flats were built as terraces, one of each pair of doors led to an upstairs flat while the other led into the ground-floor flat, each of two or three rooms. A new development in the Ouseburn valley has recreated them; Architects Cany Ash and Robert Sakula were attracted by the possibilities of high density without building high and getting rid of common areas.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Williams|first1=Francesca|title=The rise, fall and rise of the Tyneside flat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-tyne-26868399|work=BBC News |access-date=10 January 2016}}</ref>

In terms of housing stock, the authority is one of few authorities to see the proportion of detached homes rise in the 2010 Census (to 7.8%), in this instance this was coupled with a similar rise in flats and waterside apartments to 25.6%, and the proportion of converted or shared houses in 2011 renders this dwelling type within the highest of the five colour-coded brackets at 5.9%, and on a par with [[Oxford]] and [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], greater than [[Manchester]] and [[Liverpool]] and below a handful of historic densely occupied, arguably overinflated markets in the local authorities: [[Harrogate]], [[Cheltenham]], [[Bath, Somerset|Bath]], inner London, [[Hastings]], [[Brighton]] and [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-interactive-content/index.html |title=2011 Census Interactive |publisher=ons.gov.uk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129132219/http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/guide-method/census/2011/census-data/2011-census-interactive-content/index.html |archive-date=29 January 2016 }}</ref>

The nearest weather station to provide sunshine statistics is at Durham, about {{convert|14|mi|km|0}} south of [[Newcastle City Centre]]. Durham's inland, less urbanised setting results in night-time temperature data about 1 degree cooler than Newcastle proper throughout the year.

===Geordies===
{{Main|Geordie}}

The [[regional nickname]] for people from Newcastle and the surrounding area is [[Geordie]]. The [[Latin]] term ''Novocastrian'' can equally be applied to residents of [[Newcastle (disambiguation)|any place called Newcastle]], although it is most commonly used for ex-pupils of the city's [[Royal Grammar School, Newcastle|Royal Grammar School]].<ref>[http://ona.rgs.newcastle.sch.uk/ RGS Alumni – the ''Old Novocastrians' Association''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113015507/http://ona.rgs.newcastle.sch.uk/ |date=13 January 2007 }}. Retrieved 14 January 2007.</ref>

====Dialect====

The dialect of Newcastle is also referred to as [[Geordie]]. It contains a large amount of vocabulary and distinctive words and pronunciations not used in other parts of the United Kingdom. The Geordie dialect has much of its origins in the language spoken by the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] populations who migrated to and conquered much of England after the end of Roman Imperial rule. This language was the forerunner of [[Modern English]]; but while the dialects of other English regions have been heavily altered by the influences of other foreign languages—particularly [[Latin]] and [[Norman language|Norman French]]—the Geordie dialect retains many elements of the old language. An example of this is the pronunciation of certain words: "dead", "cow", "house" and "strong" are pronounced "deed", "coo", "hoos" and "strang"—which is how they were pronounced in the Anglo-Saxon language. Other Geordie words with Anglo-Saxon origins include: "larn" (from the Anglo-Saxon "laeran", meaning "teach"), "burn" ("stream") and "gan" ("go").<ref name="GeordieOrigins">{{cite web | title=North East dialect origins and the meaning of 'Geordie' | work=northeastengland.talktalk.net | url=http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/GeordieOrigins.htm | access-date=5 February 2008 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080224114420/http://www.northeastengland.talktalk.net/GeordieOrigins.htm | archive-date=24 February 2008 }}</ref>

According to the [[British Library]], "Locals insist there are significant differences between Geordie and several other local dialects, such as [[Pitmatic]] and [[Mackem]]. Pitmatic is the dialect of the former mining areas in County Durham and around Ashington to the north of Newcastle upon Tyne, while Mackem is used locally to refer to the dialect of the city of Sunderland and the surrounding urban area of Wearside".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/british-accents-and-dialects/articles/geordie-a-regional-dialect-of-english|title=Geordie: A regional dialect of English|website=The British Library|access-date=5 May 2021|archive-date=5 May 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210505185130/https://www.bl.uk/british-accents-and-dialects/articles/geordie-a-regional-dialect-of-english|url-status=dead}}</ref>

"Bairn" and "hyem", meaning "child" and "home", respectively, are examples of Geordie words with origins in Scandinavia;<ref name="bairnHyemScandinavianOrig">{{cite web | url = http://libguides.ncl.ac.uk/c.php?g=130223&p=850959 | title = Geordie dictionary | last = University Staff | date = 23 October 2017 | website = libguides.ncl.ac.uk | publisher = Newcastle University Library | access-date = 31 March 2018 | quote = Hyem: Home (of Scandinavian origin)}}</ref> ''barn'' and ''hjem'' are the corresponding modern Norwegian and Danish words. Some words used in the Geordie dialect are used elsewhere in the Northern United Kingdom. The words "bonny" (meaning "pretty") and "[[Stotting|stot]]" ("bounce") are used in Scots;   "aye" ("yes") and "nowt" (IPA:/naʊt/, rhymes with ''out'', "nothing") are used elsewhere in [[Northern England]]. Many words, however, appear to be used exclusively in Newcastle and the surrounding area, such as "canny" (a versatile word meaning "good", "nice" or "very"), "hacky" ("dirty"), "netty" ("toilet"), "hockle" ("spit").<ref>{{cite web |title=Newcastle English ("Geordie") – Vocabulary |work=une.edu.au |url=http://www.une.edu.au/langnet/definitions/geordie.html#vocab-hce |access-date=5 February 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025061829/http://www.une.edu.au/langnet/definitions/geordie.html#vocab-hce |archive-date=25 October 2007 }}</ref>

In a report, published in early February 2007 by the Ear Institute at the [[University College London]] and [[Widex]], Newcastle was named as the noisiest city in the whole of the UK with an average noise level of 80.4 [[decibel]]s. The report claimed that these noise levels would have a negative long-term impact on the health of the city's residents.<ref>{{cite news|title=Noisy Newcastle tops league table |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6320799.stm |access-date=3 February 2007 | date=2 February 2007}}</ref> The report was criticised, however, for attaching too much weight to readings at arbitrarily selected locations, which in Newcastle's case included a motorway underpass without pedestrian access.<ref>{{cite web |title=Noise study gets an ear-bashing |work=Evening Chronicle |url=http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/tm_headline=noise-study-gets-an-ear-bashing&method=full&objectid=18564076&siteid=50081-name_page.html |access-date=21 February 2007 |archive-date=18 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118023615/http://www.journallive.co.uk/north-east-news/todays-news/tm_headline%3Dnoise-study-gets-an-ear-bashing%26method%3Dfull%26objectid%3D18564076%26siteid%3D50081-name_page.html }}</ref> As well as numerous parks, open spaces, and extensive riverside areas, puzzlingly the report also overlooked the 1000-acre [[Town Moor, Newcastle upon Tyne|Town Moor]] at the heart of the city.

There is a women's football team, Newcastle United Women's Football Club, founded in 1989. [[Newcastle United W.F.C.]] currently has 40 ladies aged between 16 and 29 years signed or associated with the club, and plays in the FA Women's Premier League (North).<ref name="nuwfc">{{cite web

The Metro consists of two lines. The Green line begins at [[Newcastle Airport Metro station|Newcastle Airport]], goes through Central Newcastle and into the [[City of Sunderland]], terminating at [[South Hylton Metro station|South Hylton]]. The yellow line starts at [[St James Metro station|St James]], runs north of the river alongside [[Byker]] towards [[Whitley Bay]], before returning to Central Newcastle, then connecting to [[Gateshead Interchange]] before finally terminating at [[South Shields Metro station|South Shields]].

The system is currently undergoing a period of refurbishment and modernisation, entitled '[[Tyne and Wear Metro#Current developments|Metro: All Change]].' The programme has replaced all ticket machines and introduced ticket gates at the busiest stations – part of the transition to smart ticketing. All Metro trains are being completely refurbished and most stations are undergoing improvement works (or in some cases complete reconstruction, for example [[North Shields Metro station|North Shields]]). In addition; tracks, signalling and overhead wires are also being overhauled.<ref name="Metro2014-2">{{cite web| title = Metro: all change| publisher = nexus.org.uk |year = 2014 | url = http://www.nexus.org.uk/our-major-projects/metro-all-change | access-date = 27 November 2014}}</ref> Longer-term plans include the procurement of an entirely new fleet of trains and further extensions to the system. Proposed routes include to Newcastle's west end, to the [[Cobalt Business Park]] in North Tyneside, to the Metrocentre in Gateshead and to additional locations in Gateshead, South Tyneside and Sunderland.

===Administrative history===
Newcastle was an [[ancient borough]]. It is said to have been made a borough by [[William II of England|William II]] (reigned 1087–1100), although the earliest known charter was granted by [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (reigned 1154–1189). In 1400, a new charter from [[Henry IV of England|Henry IV]] gave the borough the right to hold its own courts and appoint its own [[sheriff]]s, making it a [[county corporate]], independent from the [[Sheriff of Northumberland]].<ref name=1835commissioners>{{cite book |title=Report of the Commissioners Appointed to Inquire into the Municipal Corporations in England and Wales: Appendix 3 |date=1835 |pages=1633–1635 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N3FTAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1633 |access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref> Whilst administratively independent, Newcastle was still deemed part of the [[Ceremonial counties of England|geographical county]] of Northumberland for the purposes of [[Lord-lieutenant|lieutenancy]] until 1974.<ref>{{cite book |title=Militia Act |date=1882 |page=21 |publisher=Sweet & Maxwell |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N4pCAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA21 |access-date=18 February 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Northumberland: Diagram showing administrative boundaries, 1972 |url=https://maps.nls.uk/view/241243837 |website=National Library of Scotland |publisher=Ordnance Survey |access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref>

The Northumberland [[assizes]] were held at [[The Castle, Newcastle|the Castle]] in Newcastle, and subsequently at the [[Moot Hall, Newcastle upon Tyne|Moot Hall]], built within the castle site in 1811.<ref>{{NHLE|desc=Moot Hall, Castle Garth|num=1116297|grade=I|access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref> The Moot Hall also served as the meeting place of [[Northumberland County Council]] from its creation in 1889 until 1981 when the county council moved to [[Morpeth, Northumberland|Morpeth]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=48579|page=5337|date=10 April 1981}}</ref> Newcastle was therefore sometimes described as the [[county town]] of Northumberland,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bell |first1=James |title=A new and comprehensive gazetteer of England and Wales |date=1835 |page=254 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WwoHAAAAQAAJ&pg=RA1-PA254 |access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref> although that title was also claimed by [[Alnwick]], where [[knights of the shire]] were elected until the [[Reform Act 1832]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Penny Cyclopaedia, Volumes 15–16 |date=1839 |publisher=Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ns5PAAAAMAAJ&pg=RA1-PA316 |page=316 |access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref>

Until the 1830s the borough just covered the four parishes of [[All Saints' Church, Newcastle upon Tyne|All Saints]], [[St Andrew's Church, Newcastle upon Tyne|St Andrew]], [[St John the Baptist Church, Newcastle upon Tyne|St John]], and [[Newcastle Cathedral|St Nicholas]].<ref name=1835commissioners/> The [[parliamentary borough]] (constituency) was enlarged in 1832 to also take in [[Byker]], [[Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne|Elswick]], [[Heaton, Newcastle upon Tyne|Heaton]], [[Jesmond]] and [[Westgate, Newcastle upon Tyne|Westgate]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Parliamentary Boundaries Act |date=1832 |page=353 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Uq0uAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA353 |access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref> The municipal boundaries were enlarged to match the constituency in 1836, when Newcastle was reformed to become a [[municipal borough]] under the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]], which standardised how most boroughs operated across the country.<ref>{{cite book |title=Municipal Corporations Act |date=1835 |pages=457 |url=https://archive.org/details/statutesunitedk35britgoog/page/456/mode/2up |access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref>

Newcastle was awarded city status in 1882. When elected county councils were established in 1889, Newcastle was considered large enough to provide its own county-level services, and so it was made a [[county borough]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Local Government Act 1888|year=1888|chapter=41}}</ref> The city boundaries were enlarged on several occasions, notably in 1904 when it absorbed [[Benwell]], [[Fenham]] and [[Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne|Walker]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Local Government Board's Provisional Orders Confirmation (No. 13) Act 1904 |url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/Edw7/4/162/contents/enacted |website=legislation.gov.uk |publisher=The National Archives |access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref> and in 1935 when it absorbed [[Kenton, Newcastle upon Tyne|Kenton]] and parts of neighbouring parishes.<ref>{{cite web |title=Newcastle upon Tyne Municipal Borough / County Borough |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10108913#tab02 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref> In 1906 the city was given the right to appoint a [[List of mayors of Newcastle upon Tyne|Lord Mayor]].<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=27936|page=5232|date=31 July 1906}}</ref>

In 1974 the county borough was replaced by a larger metropolitan borough within the new county of Tyne and Wear. The borough gained the area of the former [[Urban district (England and Wales)|urban districts]] of [[Gosforth]] and [[Newburn]], and the parishes of Brunswick, Dinnington, Hazlerigg, North Gosforth and Woolsington. It also gained the Moot Hall, which until 1974 had been an [[exclave]] of the administrative county of Northumberland surrounded by the city.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Local Government Act 1972|year=1972|chapter=70|schedule=1|access-date=25 March 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The Metropolitan Districts (Names) Order 1973|year=1973|number=137}}</ref> Newcastle's city status was transferred to the enlarged borough at the same time.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=46255|page=4400|date=4 April 1974}}</ref>

From 1974 until 1986 the city council was a lower-tier district authority, with [[Tyne and Wear County Council]] providing county-level services. The county council was abolished in 1986, since when the city council has again provided both district-level and county-level services, as it had done when it was a county borough prior to 1974. Some functions are provided across Tyne and Wear by joint committees with the other districts. The county of Tyne and Wear continues to exist as a [[ceremonial county]] for the purposes of lieutenancy, but has had no administrative functions since 1986.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=act|act=Local Government Act 1985|year=1985|chapter=51|access-date=29 March 2024}}</ref>

Newcastle University has its origins in the [[Durham University]] School of Medicine and Surgery, established in 1834.
It became fully independent on 1 August 1963, forming the University of Newcastle upon Tyne (now simply Newcastle University). It is a [[red brick university]] and is a member of the [[Russell Group]], an association of research-intensive UK universities, often considered to represent the best UK universities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.russellgroup.ac.uk/ |title=The Russell Group |publisher=The [[Russell Group]] |access-date=29 March 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History |publisher=Newcastle University |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/history/unihistory.phtml |access-date=22 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070912093004/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/about/history/unihistory.phtml |archive-date=12 September 2007 }}</ref> It won the [[Sunday Times University of the Year|''Sunday Times'' University of the Year]] award in 2000.<ref>{{Cite news |first=Alastair |last=McCall |title=King of the Castle |format=Reprint on Newcastle University's website |work=Sunday Times |url=http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/award.html |date=17 September 2000 |access-date=22 September 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070918021604/http://www.ncl.ac.uk/press.office/award.html |archive-date=18 September 2007 }}</ref> It was awarded the Gold Award in the [[Teaching Excellence Framework]] (TEF), one of only ten Russell Group universities to achieve the Gold TEF rating.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/university-teaching-scores-russell-group-improvements-government-rankings-tef-a8386321.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220618/https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/university-teaching-scores-russell-group-improvements-government-rankings-tef-a8386321.html |archive-date=18 June 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Elite universities improve teaching scores after requesting to be judged again in government rankings|author=Eleanor Busby|work=[[The Independent]]|date=6 June 2018}}</ref>

Newcastle has three cathedrals, the [[Anglican]] [[Newcastle Cathedral|St Nicholas']], with its elegant [[lantern tower]] of 1474, the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[St Mary's Cathedral, Newcastle upon Tyne|St Mary's]] designed by [[Augustus Welby Pugin]] and the [[Coptic Orthodox Church in Britain and Ireland|Coptic Orthodox]] Cathedral in [[Fenham]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.resourcescentreonline.co.uk/fc-chr-or-coptic.html |title=Coptic Orthodox Faith Contacts – North East Religious Learning Resources Centre |publisher=Resourcescentreonline.co.uk |access-date=4 August 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910090721/http://www.resourcescentreonline.co.uk/fc-chr-or-coptic.html |archive-date=10 September 2012 }}</ref> All three cathedrals began their lives as parish churches. St Mary's became a cathedral in 1850 and St Nicholas' in 1882. Another prominent church in the city centre is the [[Church of St Thomas the Martyr, Newcastle|Church of St Thomas the Martyr]] which is unique as the only [[Church of England]] church without a parish and which is not a [[Royal Peculiar|peculiar]].

One of the largest [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Anglican]] churches in the UK is [[Jesmond Parish Church]], situated a little to the north of the city centre.

Newcastle is home to the only [[Baháʼí Faith|Baháʼí]] Centre in North East England; the centre has served the local Baháʼí community for over 25 years and is located close to the Civic Centre in [[Jesmond]].

Newcastle was a prominent centre of the [[Plymouth Brethren]] movement up to the 1950s, and some small congregations still function. Among these are at the Hall, Denmark Street and Gospel Hall, St Lawrence.
