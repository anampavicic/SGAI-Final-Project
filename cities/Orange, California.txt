'''Orange''' is a city located in northern [[Orange County, California]], United States. It is approximately {{convert|3|mi}} north of the [[county seat]], [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]]. Orange is unusual in this region because many of the homes in its Old Town District were built before 1920. While many other cities in the region demolished such houses in the 1960s, Orange decided to preserve them. The small city of [[Villa Park, California|Villa Park]] is surrounded by the city of Orange. The population of Orange was 139,911 as of [[2020 United States Census|2020]].<ref name="QuickFacts"/>

==History==
{{more citations needed section|date=July 2013}}
Members of the [[Tongva]] and [[Juaneño]]/[[Luiseño]] ethnic group long inhabited this area. After the 1769 expedition of [[Gaspar de Portolá]], an expedition out of [[San Blas, Nayarit]], Mexico, led by Father [[Junípero Serra]], named the area Vallejo de Santa Ana (Valley of Saint Anne). On November 1, 1776, [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] became the area's first permanent European settlement in [[Alta California]], [[New Spain]].<ref>[https://www.historicalorange.org/new-page#:~:text=The%20Tongva%2C%20later%20know%20as,as%20far%20inland%20into%20Temecula History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230213084117/https://www.historicalorange.org/new-page#:~:text=The%20Tongva%2C%20later%20know%20as,as%20far%20inland%20into%20Temecula|date=February 13, 2023}}.</ref>

In 1801, the [[Spanish Empire]] granted {{convert|62500|acre|km2}} to [[José Antonio Yorba]], which he named ''Rancho San Antonio''. Yorba's great rancho included the lands where the cities of [[Olive, California|Olive]], Orange, [[El Modena]], [[Villa Park, California|Villa Park]], [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], [[Tustin]], [[Costa Mesa]] and [[Newport Beach]] stand today. Smaller ranchos evolved from this large rancho, including the [[Rancho Santiago de Santa Ana]].{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

Don Juan Pablo Grijalva, a retired known Spanish [[soldier]] and the area's first landowner, was granted permission in 1809 by the Spanish [[Colonialism|colonial]] government to establish a [[Ranchos of California|rancho]] in "''the place of the Arroyo de Santiago''".{{citation needed|date=September 2022}}

After the [[Mexican–American War]], Alta California was ceded to the United States by [[Mexico]] with the signing of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] in 1848, and though many [[Californio]]s lost titles to their lands in the aftermath, Grijalva's descendants retained ownership through marriages to [[Anglo]]-[[United States|Americans]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 25, 2021 |title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) |url=https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/treaty-of-guadalupe-hidalgo |access-date=September 28, 2022 |website=National Archives |language=en |archive-date=September 28, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220928083014/https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/treaty-of-guadalupe-hidalgo |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since at least 1864, Los Angeles attorneys [[Alfred Chapman]] and [[Andrew Glassell]], together and separately, held about {{convert|5400|acre|km2}} along both sides of the [[Santiago Creek]] (Glassell also had a {{convert|4000|acre|km2|adj=on}} parcel where Costa Mesa is today). Water was the key factor for the location of their townsite (bordered by Almond Avenue on the south, Lemon Street on the west, Glassell Street on the east, and Maple Avenue on the north). Glassell needed a spot he could irrigate, bringing water down from the Santa Ana Canyon and the quality of the soil may have influenced his choice. Originally, the community was named ''Richland'', but in 1873 Richland got a new name.
In the book, ''Orange, The City 'Round The Plaza'' by local historian [[Phil Brigandi]], it states, "In 1873 the town had grown large enough to require a post office, so an application was sent to Washington. It was refused, however, as there was (and is) already a Richland, California in [[Sacramento County]]. Undaunted, the Richlanders proposed a new name – Orange."<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Orange |url=https://www.historicalorange.org/new-page |access-date=September 28, 2022 |website=Orange Community Historical Society |language=en-US |archive-date=September 28, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220928082947/https://www.historicalorange.org/new-page |url-status=live }}</ref>

The small town was incorporated on April 6, 1888, under the general laws of the state of California. Orange was the only city in Orange County to be planned and built around a plaza, earning it the nickname ''Plaza City''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.cityoforange.org/localhistory/plaza/history.htm|title= The Plaza – History|publisher= City of Orange CA|access-date= May 3, 2009|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090626064402/http://www.cityoforange.org/localhistory/plaza/history.htm|archive-date= June 26, 2009|url-status= dead|df= mdy-all}}</ref> Orange was the first developed town site to be served by the [[California Southern Railroad]] when the nation's second [[Transcontinental railroad|transcontinental rail line]] reached Orange County.<ref>According to company records{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}</ref>

The town experienced its first growth spurt during the last decade of the 19th century (as did many of the surrounding communities), thanks to ever-increasing demands for California-grown citrus fruits, a period some refer to as the "Orange Era". Southern California's real estate "boom" of 1886–1888, fueled by railroad rate wars, also contributed to a marked increase in population. Like most cities in Orange County, agriculture formed the backbone of the local economy, and growth thereafter was slow and steady until the 1950s, when a second real estate boom spurred development. Inspired by the development of a region-wide [[freeway]] system which connected Los Angeles' urban center with outlying areas like Orange, large tracts of housing were developed from the 1950s to the early 1970s and continues today, albeit at a much slower pace, at the eastern edge of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A Brief History of Orange – Orange County Historical Society |url=https://www.orangecountyhistory.org/wp/?page_id=197 |access-date=2024-07-16 |language=en-US |archive-date=July 16, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240716061225/https://www.orangecountyhistory.org/wp/?page_id=197 |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], the City of Orange approved the closure of North and South Glassell Street to open the Orange Plaza Paseo, where businesses located on each street could open [[Social distancing|socially-distant]] outdoor seating and patios. On December 8, 2020, the city council voted unanimously to continue to keep the street closed until state or local restrictions end or by council direction.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Hicks|first1=Angelina|last2=Joukhadar|first2=Joy|date=December 22, 2020|title=Orange City Council Extends Glassell Street Closure in Orange Plaza Paseo|url=https://voiceofoc.org/2020/12/orange-city-council-extends-glassell-street-closure-in-orange-plaza-paseo/|access-date=February 23, 2021|work=Voice of OC|language=en-US|archive-date=January 29, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210129015636/https://voiceofoc.org/2020/12/orange-city-council-extends-glassell-street-closure-in-orange-plaza-paseo/|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Geography==
The city has a total area of {{convert|25.2|sqmi|km2}}, {{convert|24.8|sqmi|km2}} of which is land and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2}} of which is water. The total area is 1.75% water.

===Climate===
Southern California is well known for year-round pleasant weather: 
* On average, the warmest month is August.<ref>[https://www.msn.com/en-us/weather/today/Orange,CA,United-States/we-city iso=US&form=PRWLAS&q=335%20E%20Maple%20Ave%2C%20Orange%2C%20CA%2092866&el=g7Ozp8CoFMezIlEtUYVYMw%3D%3D: MSN Weather] Retrieved September 9, 2017</ref>
* The highest recorded temperature was {{convert|113|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in June 2016.
* On average, the coolest month is December.
* The lowest recorded temperature was {{convert|25|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in December 1990.
* The maximum average precipitation occurs in January.<ref>[http://www.weather.com Orange, CA: Weather Facts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323015551/http://www.weather.com/ |date=March 23, 2007 }} Retrieved May 7, 2009</ref>

The period of April through November is warm and dry with average high temperatures of {{convert|74|to|84|°F|0}} and lows of {{convert|52|to|64|°F|0}}. The period of November through March is somewhat rainy, as shown in the table to right.<ref>{{cite web|title=National and Local Weather Forecast, Hurricane, Radar and Report|url=http://www.weather.com/|work=The Weather Channel|access-date=May 8, 2009|archive-date=March 23, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323015551/http://www.weather.com/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Orange County area is also subject to the phenomena typical of a [[microclimate]]. As such, the temperatures can vary as much as {{convert|18|F-change}} between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient of over 1&nbsp;°F per mile (0.3&nbsp;°C/km) from the coast inland. California also has a weather phenomenon called "[[June Gloom]]" or "May Gray", which sometimes brings overcast or foggy skies in the morning on the coast, but usually gives way to sunny skies by noon, during late spring and early summer.
The Orange County area averages {{convert|15|in|mm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually, which mainly occurs during the winter and spring (November thru April) with generally light rain showers, but sometimes as heavy rainfall and thunderstorms. Coastal Torrance receives slightly less rainfall, while the mountains receive slightly more. Snowfall is extremely rare in the city basin, but the mountains in the surrounding areas receive snowfall every winter.

Orange, like much of Orange County, is known for its [[affluence]] and political [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] – a 2005 academic study listed Orange among three Orange County cities as being among America's 25 "most conservative", making it one of two counties in the country containing more than one such city ([[Maricopa County, Arizona]] also has three cities on the list).<ref>{{cite web|date=August 16, 2005|title=Study ranks America's most liberal and conservative cities|url=http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722203607/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/|archive-date=July 22, 2012|access-date=July 22, 2010|publisher=Govpro.com}}</ref>

Orange remains a somewhat conservative city in recent years; however, in 2016, [[Hillary Clinton]] defeated [[Donald Trump]] by 1,463 votes (2.7%). Nevertheless, the city voted 3% more Republican than the average of Orange County, and nearly 14% more Republican than the state of California as a whole. In 2020, [[Joe Biden]] carried the city by a larger margin, winning 52.5% of the vote to Donald Trump's 45.2%, though this was still much narrower than his statewide margin.

According to the [[Secretary of State of California|California Secretary of State]], as of February 10, 2019, Orange had 69,828 registered voters. Of those, 25,744 (36.87%) were registered Republicans, 22,162 (31.74%) are registered Democrats, and 18,759 (26.86%) were independents.<ref>{{cite web|title=CA Secretary of State – Report of Registration – February 10, 2019|url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-odd-year-2019/politicalsub.pdf|access-date=June 26, 2019|website=ca.gov|archive-date=March 23, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190323230212/https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/ror/ror-odd-year-2019/politicalsub.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Automobile====
Orange is situated near [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]], also known as the [[Santa Ana Freeway]]. The junction of I-5 with two state highways ([[California State Route 57|SR 57]], the "Orange Freeway" and [[California State Route 22|SR 22]], the "Garden Grove Freeway"), commonly called the [[Orange Crush interchange|"Orange Crush"]], is one of the busiest interchanges in Orange County, and is located on the southwestern edge of the city. The Costa Mesa Freeway ([[California State Route 55|SR 55]]) also passes through Orange, meeting the eastern terminus of SR 22 in the southern part of the city. The eastern areas of Orange are served by the Eastern and Foothill [[toll road|Toll Roads]] ([[California State Route 261|SR 261]] and [[California State Route 241|SR 241]]) which connect the city with the cities of [[Irvine, California|Irvine]] and [[Rancho Santa Margarita, California|Rancho Santa Margarita]].

====Rail====
[[Image:Former ATSF Station in Orange CA 7-14-04.jpg|thumb|right|Former Santa Fe depot, now a restaurant. Metrolink service at [[Orange Transportation Center]] uses the adjacent platforms.]]
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2022}}

The town's first rail service, the Santa Ana, Orange and Tustin Street Railway, was a {{convert|4.04|mi}} long [[horsecar]] line that ran between Santa Ana and Orange, beginning in 1886. One year later, the Santa Ana and Orange Motor Road Company purchased the line, using a steam "dummy" car and a single gasoline motorcar as its means of conveyance. In 1906, [[Henry E. Huntington]] acquired the company under the auspices of the Los Angeles Inter-Urban Railway and electrified the line.

Passenger service over the new line operated by Huntington's [[Pacific Electric Railway]] began on June 8, 1914, originating at the PE's depot on Lemon Street. The route provided freight service to the local citrus growers, in direct competition with the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]]. Pacific Electric sold out in 1961 to the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]], who ultimately abandoned the line in 1964.

The Santa Fe, under its affiliate the [[Southern California Railway]], laid its first tracks through Orange in 1886, and established its first depot the following year. The route would become part of the railroad's famous "[[Surf Line]]", and by 1925, 16 daily passenger trains (the Santa Fe's ''[[San Diegan (train)|San Diegan]]'') made stops in Orange. During peak growing seasons, as many as 48 carloads of [[citrus]] [[fruit]]s, [[olive]]s, and [[walnut]]s were shipped daily from the Orange depot as well.

Orange's former Santa Fe depot, in [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean Revival]] style, still stands adjacent to the current [[Orange Transportation Center]], which uses the platform area. It was dedicated on May 1, 1938, and was closed with the discontinuation of passenger service in 1971, though commuter service resumed at the adjacent platform in 1993. The building was granted historic landmark status by the city on November 15, 1990. In July 2004, the facility was home to a ''Cask 'n Cleaver'' restaurant and was remodeled and reopened in 2011 as a Ruby's Diner.

Rail connections to Los Angeles, the [[Inland Empire]], and [[San Diego County, California|Northern San Diego County]] are provided by the [[Metrolink (California)|Metrolink]] regional commuter rail network. The [[Orange Transportation Center]]'s platform is situated adjacent to the former Santa Fe depot in the downtown Historic District, which is also home to an [[Orange County Transportation Authority]] (OCTA) [[bus]] station, is the second busiest station of the entire Metrolink train system due to its position serving as a transfer station for the Orange County and the IEOC Metrolink lines. The former Santa Fe mainline links the cities of Los Angeles, [[Riverside, California|Riverside]], and [[San Diego]] via a junction north of the station.

====Airports====
[[John Wayne Airport]] (SNA), in nearby Santa Ana, provides daily scheduled airline service for the area.

===Emergency services===
Law enforcement is provided by the Orange Police Department (OPD), which covers a jurisdictional area of roughly {{convert|27|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}.
