'''Gorontalo''' ({{lang-gor|Hulontalo}}) is a city and the capital of the [[Gorontalo|Gorontalo Province]], Sulawesi, Indonesia. The city has an area of 79.59&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and had a population of 179,991 at the 2010 census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 20112">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 198,539 at the 2020 census;<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 20212">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> the official estimate as at mid 2023 was 205,390.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Gorontalo Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.7571)</ref> Previously part of [[North Sulawesi]], it became the capital of the newly-formed Gorontalo Province on 5 December 2000 when that province was separated from North Sulawesi. As the largest settlement and the only city in the province, it is the economic, political, and educational center of the province, hosting most of its universities and is the location of one of the only two public university in the province.

The city is also cultural center of the [[Gorontalo people]] and have been under various small kingdoms and later the Islamic Gorontalo Kingdom, among others before being incorporated under [[Dutch East Indies]] as ''Afdeling'' Gorontalo and then later ''kotapraja'' under the Indonesian Republic. Due to relatively religious culture of the Gorontaloan people and its history with [[Islam]], the city is sometimes referred to as "Porch of [[Medina]]".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Media |first=Kompas Cyber |date=25 July 2022 |title=Mengapa Gorontalo Disebut Kota Serambi Madinah?

== History ==

=== Etymology ===
There are several theories regarding the origin of the city's name. One theory suggest that it was shortened version of ''Huluntalangio'', name of a kingdom in the area which became Hulontalo. Later during the first contact with the Dutch explorers, Dutch people find it difficult to spell Hulontalo and the word became corrupted to "Gorontalo" which stuck as the name of the city to this day.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sino |first=Didin |title=0 |url=https://pkmkotabarat.gorontalokota.go.id/page/sejarah-gorontalo |access-date=31 October 2023 |website=Pemerintah Kota Gorontalo |language=id}}</ref> Other theories include ''Hulutalangi'' which means "more honourable", ''Hulua lo tola'' which means "place for gabus fish (''[[Channa striata]]'') to breed", ''Pogolatalo'' which means "place to wait", or directly Gorontalo which is derived from name of a Moluccas ruler [[Gorontalo of Tidore]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite journal |last=Marzuki |first=Irfanuddin Wahid |date=2018 |title=Perkembangan morfologi Kota Gorontalo dari masa tradisional hingga kolonial |url=https://repositori.kemdikbud.go.id/9904/1/Gorontalo.pdf |journal=Berkala Arkeologi |volume=38 |issue=1 |pages=39–58 |doi=10.30883/jba.v38i1.236}}</ref>

=== Early and colonial history ===
Gorontalo city is considered among the oldest cities in Sulawesi, dating back approximately 400 years together with [[Makassar]], [[Parepare]], and [[Manado]]. It was the center of Islamic propagation in Sulawesi under Ternate rule.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last1=Yuliadi |first1=Imamudin |last2=Marpaung |first2=Heri Kurniawan |date=4 February 2010 |title=Analisis Ekonomi Propinsi Gorontalo Evaluasi Kebijakan Pemekaran Wilayah |url=https://journal.umy.ac.id/index.php/bti/article/view/2414 |journal=Jurnal Bisnis: Teori Dan Implementasi |language=en |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=137–157 |doi=10.18196/jbti.v1i1.2414 |doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 |issn=2622-0733}}</ref> The area that what is now the city was once a region (''Pohala'') under Kingdom of Gorontalo. The kingdom consisted of alliances of 17 smaller groups called ''linula''. Kingdom of Gorontalo was a vassal under [[Ternate Sultanate]] in Moluccas. Islamic propagation in the region around the today's city started between 14th and 15th centuries, started with the period under the ruler named Sultan Amai who married a princess from nearby Palase Gomonjolo Kingdom, who asked the Sultan Amai previously to convert to Islam as part of the marriage arrangement in 1525. Islam later spread to the Gorontalo Kingdom and became official religion of the kingdom under rule of King Matolodulakiki. During this period, principle of Gorontaloan culture regarding Islam which is "''adat basandi syara', syara' basandi kitabullah''" (traditions based on Sharia, Sharia based on Qur'an) was coined.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mashadi |first1=Mashadi |last2=Suryani |first2=Wahidah |date=1 December 2018 |title=Jaringan Islamisasi Gorontalo (Fenomena Keagamaan dan Perkembangan Islam di Gorontalo) |url=https://journal.iaingorontalo.ac.id/index.php/au/article/view/555 |journal=Al-Ulum |language=id |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=435–458 |doi=10.30603/au.v18i2.555 |issn=2442-8213 |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Native rule in this area ended with transfer of all Ternate's Sulawesi possessions to the [[Dutch East India Company (VOC)]] under a treaty which became effective on 11 May 1677. This transfer of possession includes Gorontalo and its neighbouring kingdoms in the northern part of Sulawesi. Dutch East India Company built its first trade office around the area of what is now the city in 1705 to organize trade relations with the native kingdoms which is now under the company's rule. Later, Dutch rule in the area was strengthened by the construction of Nassare Fort in 1770. As Dutch East India Company dissolves in 1799, the area became direct possession of the Dutch and later Dutch East Indies colony. From then, the Dutch became increasingly involved in successions and appointment of local rulers.<ref name=":0" />

On 1824, the area around Gorontalo was merged with Minahasan region to become an ''afdeeling'' which is led by an assistant resident. In 1899, another administrative change took place which made Gorontalo immediately administrated from [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]], the form that was called "''Rechtstreeks Bestuur''". On 1911, again another administrative change took place, this time the ''pohala'' was reorganized and became divided into three ''onder afdeelingen'', which are Kwandang, Boalemo, and Gorontalo. In 1920, ''onder afdeeling'' was changed into ''district''. At this time, Gorontalo region was divided into five districts including Limboto and Bone. This change did not last long and later in 1922 it was divided and reorganized again into three ''afdeelingen'', which are Gorontalo, Boalemo, and Buol.<ref name=":0" />

=== World War II and post-independence era ===
[[File:Portrait of Nani Wartabone, Sulawesi Utara Bergolak, p34.jpg|left|thumb|Nani Wartabone, leader of Merah Putih movement, a revolt centered around Gorontalo and Central Sulawesi region]]
Just before the invasion of the region by [[Empire of Japan]] during [[World War II]], a revolt broke out led by [[Nani Wartabone]] who declared Indonesian independence on 23 January 1942 under ''Merah Putih'' (Red and White) movement, around three years before it would be formally declared again by [[Sukarno]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Soewarsono |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V0FSAQAAMAAJ&q=nani+wartabone+deklarasi |title=Nasionalisme Indonesia dalam kerangka otonomi daerah: rekonstruksi pluralisme dan etnisitas dalam gagasan pemekaran di Provinsi Sumatera Utara |last2=Suartina |first2=Tine |last3=Widyawati |first3=Nina |date=2010 |publisher=Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia |isbn=978-979-799-594-2 |language=id}}</ref> However, the revolt was later suppressed by occupying [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] who assumed control of Sulawesi and East Indonesia.<ref name=":32">{{Cite book |last=Mamar |first=Sulaiman |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/15864232 |title=Sejarah sosial daerah Sulawesi Tengah (wajah kota Donggala dan Palu) |date=1984–1985 |publisher=Departemen Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan, Direktorat Sejarah dan Nilai Tradisional, Proyek Inventarisasi dan Dokumentasi Sejarah Nasional |oclc=15864232}}</ref> After World War II and the aftermath of the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], Gorontalo became part of [[State of East Indonesia]] as a ''neoswapraja'' together with Mongondow and Buol. When State of East Indonesia was dissolved in 1950, Gorontalo became part of North Sulawesi region under then-Sulawesi Province. On 1954, ''neoswapraja'' Mongondow was separated from North Sulawesi, leaving only Buol and Gorontalo as part of it. Later, in accordance of Law Number 1 of 1957, as Indonesia reorganized its administrative structure, Gorontalo became part of first-level administrative division (''daerah tingkat I'') and Gorontalo city was separated from [[Gorontalo Regency]], granting the city status of ''kotapraja.''<ref name=":0" /> During [[Permesta]] rebellion, the city hosts Indonesian military radio used to persuade the rebels to surrender.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sejarah Singkat Rri Gorontalo |url=https://ppid.rri.co.id/download/dokumen/sejarah_rri_gorontalo.pdf/24036}}</ref>

The city became the capital of the newly created province of [[Gorontalo]] in 2000 and has since seen urban growth and took more significant importance, being the center of the new province's economy, educational, and administrative functions, especially between 2006 and 2007 where the new province overall saw rapid economic growth and massive increase of its gross regional product.<ref name=":1" />
