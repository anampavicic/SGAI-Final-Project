==History==
Ise's history is directly linked to that of Ise Grand Shrine. Ise Grand Shrine is separated into two main parts: The Inner Shrine and the Outer Shrine. Despite the names, these are actually two physically separate shrines approximately six kilometers apart. Ise began with small settlements that had sprung up around the two shrines.  During the [[Edo period]], Ise was a major destination for [[pilgrimages]] which were called "o-Ise-mairi" (literally, "Coming to Ise") and thus, these settlements grew larger and developed into small villages.  The village around the Inner Shrine was named '''Uji,''' and the village around the Outer Shrine was named '''Yamada'''.  Because of the religious importance of Ise Grand Shrine, the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] during the [[Edo period]] viewed the area as politically significant and installed a [[bugyo|magistrate]] in Yamada.

During the [[Meiji period]], these two villages were merged with the establishment of the modern municipal system to form the town of Ujiyamada. The town was upgraded to city status on September 1, 1906. In 1909, the forerunner to the [[Japanese National Railways|JNR]]  connected Ujiyamada by train, followed by the forerunner of [[Kintetsu Railway]] in 1930. These lines were responsible for a large increase in pilgrims and tourists visiting Ise Grand Shrine, peaking with an estimated eight million visitors in the year 1940, per government-sponsored ceremonies celebrating the 2600th anniversary of the foundation of the Japanese empire. The significance of the Ise Grand Shrine to [[State Shinto]] made Ujiyamada a target for six air raids during [[World War II]], the largest of which was on July 28, 1945 when 93 [[Twentieth Air Force]] [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] bombers dropped incendiaries, burning 39% of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://paul.rutgers.edu/~mcgrew/wwii/usaf/html/Jul.45.html |title=USAAF Chronology: ''COMBAT CHRONOLOGY OF THE US ARMY AIR FORCES, JULY 1945'' |access-date=2008-05-20 |archive-date=2020-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201113094241/http://paul.rutgers.edu/~mcgrew/wwii/usaf/html/Jul.45.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On January 1, 1955 Ujiyamada absorbed the villages of Toyohama, Kitahama, Shigō and Kida and was renamed Ise City. The reason for this change is to avoid naming confusion with the later-formed cities of [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] in [[Kyōto Prefecture]] and the city of [[Yamada, Fukuoka|Yamada]] (now the city of [[Kama, Fukuoka|Kama]]) in [[Fukuoka Prefecture]].  The name "Ise" was chosen because it was already recognized throughout Japan due to Ise Grand Shrine. However, the renaming phase took some time around the city.  For example, it took four years to rename the main JR station in town, Yamada Station, to [[Iseshi Station]]. Some things were never renamed, such as [[Ujiyamada Station]], Ise's largest train station, and Ujiyamada High School, Ise's first high school.

On September 26, 1959: The [[Typhoon Vera (1959)|Ise-wan Typhoon]], Japan's strongest-recorded typhoon, hit Ise and surrounding areas.

On November 1, 2005: Ise absorbed the towns of [[Futami, Mie|Futami]] and [[Obata, Mie|Obata]] and the village of [[Misono, Mie|Misono]] (all from [[Watarai District, Mie|Watarai District]]).

==Government==
Ise has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Ise contributes four members to the Mie Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Mie 4th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

The city also has one private middle school and four private high schools. The [[Shinto]]-affiliated [[Kogakkan University]] is located in Ise.

==Transportation==
=== Railway ===
Ise is easily accessible by rail due to the popularity of Ise Grand Shrine as a tourist attraction. [[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu]] offers direct service to Ise from [[Kyoto]], [[Osaka]] and [[Nagoya]] in the form of regular express trains (once or twice an hour) and limited express trains (usually twice an hour).  The ride from Osaka takes about 135 minutes (105 minutes on the limited express), the ride from Nagoya takes about 100 minutes (85 minutes on the limited express). [[Central Japan Railway Company|JR Central]], offers direct service to Ise from Nagoya once an hour on the [[Mie Rapid]], which takes about 90 minutes.

*'''[[Ise Grand Shrine]]:''' It is sometimes called "The Shrine of the shrines" to indicate its status as the most sacred Shintō shrine.  Legend has it that [[Yata no Kagami]] (The Sacred Mirror), one of the [[Three Sacred Treasures of Japan]], is housed somewhere within the grounds.  The entire Shrine is completely rebuilt from scratch every 20 years using fresh lumber that is brought to Ise and then ceremonially carried through the streets on its way to the Shrine during an ''okihiki'' (お木曳).  The Shrine is in its 62nd reconstruction, meaning this tradition has been carried out for at least 1,240 years.  The next reconstruction will be in 2033.
** '''Outer Shrine''' (外宮 ''gekū''): Sometimes called ''toyouke-daijingū'' (豊受大神宮), it is dedicated to [[Toyoukebime|Toyouke-Ōmikami]], the goddess of food, clothing, and shelter (life's basic needs).  Pilgrims are supposed to visit the Outer Shrine before visiting the Inner Shrine.  The Outer Shrine is very close to [[Ise-shi Station]]. 
** '''Inner Shrine''' (内宮 ''naikū''): Sometimes called ''kō-taijingū'' (皇大神宮), it is dedicated to [[Amaterasu|Amaterasu-Ōmikami]], the sun goddess who is sometimes called the "supreme kami."  This shrine sees many visitors from around Japan on a daily basis; there is a sharp increase during the [[Japanese New Year|New Year's season]]. People traditionally visit a shrine on [[New Year's Day]], but since it will be the [[Hatsumōde|first visit of a new year]], special consideration is given to the choice of shrine. Some people travel to shrines that may be more significant than those in their own area, and this inevitably leads people to Ise Grand Shrine, particularly the Inner Shrine. The inner sanctum of the main shrine area within the Inner Shrine is off-limits to visitors, thus only the rooftop of the structure that houses the kami can be seen. 
** '''Cultural facilities:''' These institutions provide a deeper understanding of Ise Grand Shrine. They are all housed at the top Mt. Kurata which is part of the pilgrimage route between the Outer Shrine and the Inner Shrine.
*** '''{{visanc|History Museum}}''' or Jingu Chokokan Museum (神宮徴古館 ''jingū-chōkokan'') chronicles the creation and development of the Shrine.
*** '''Fine Art Museum''' (神宮美術館 ''jingū-bijutsukan'') displays works by artists and painters donated during the reconstruction ceremony that is held once every 20 years.
*** '''Agricultural Museum''' (神宮農業館 ''jingū-nōgyōkan''): Since the Outer Shrine is dedicated to Toyouke-Ōmikami, the goddess of life's basic needs, this museum covers how agriculture fulfills these needs.
*** '''Library''' (神宮文庫 ''jingū-bunko'') contains various volumes dealing with Shintō and Ise Grand Shrine. Open to the public but generally only used by researchers and Shintō priests.
** '''Oharai Machi''' (おはらい町): A small side street that runs between Prefectural Route 32 and the entrance to the Inner Shrine with buildings that are made to evoke the Edo period. The part of the road near the Inner Shrine offers all sort of [[omiyage]] souvenirs.  This road is home to the main akafuku (adzuki bean sweet) shop.
** '''Okage Yoko-chō''' (おかげ横丁): This area branches off of Oharai Machi about halfway between Prefectural Route 32 and the entrance to the Inner Shrine.  It has a large concentration of eateries. [[Taiko]] performances can be heard here sometimes, usually on the weekends.{{citation needed|date=August 2020}}
* {{nihongo|'''[[The Wedded Rocks]]'''|夫婦岩 |meoto-iwa}}: Located at Futami Okitama Shrine (二見興玉神社) in northeastern Ise.  The rocks have been enshrined and are thus considered gods. 
* '''[[Ise-Shima National Park]]'''
** '''Ise-Shima Skyline:''' A 16.3-km-long scenic mountain road between Ise and Toba. 
** '''Mt. Asama''' (朝熊山): At 555m, this is the highest mountain in Ise; its two TV towers make it very distinctive.  A lookout point is accessible from the Ise-Shima Skyline road.  Nearby is a spa. The summit can also be reached on foot, beginning just north of [[Asama Station]].
** '''Kongōshō Temple''' (金剛證寺): A [[Buddhist]] temple near the top of Mt. Asama.  It is accessible from the Ise-Shima Skyline road.
* '''[[Miya River (Mie)|Miya River]]'''
** '''Riverside Park''' (宮川堤公園 ''miya-gawa tsutsumi kōen''): A [[Hanami|cherry blossom viewing]] area, making it a popular destination during the prime blooming season early in April.  Fireworks are hosted in mid-July.  The park is on the east side of the river near the [[Watarai Bridge]].
** '''Love River''' (ラブリバー) houses public leisure and sports facilities for [[baseball]], [[soccer]], [[basketball]], and [[tennis]].  The park is on the east side of the river near Route 23.
* '''Edo Wonderland Ise''' (安土桃山文化村 ''azuchi momoyama bunka mura''): A theme park in Futami with an [[Edo period|Edo-period]] theme, featuring samurai, a ninja maze, and a ghost house.
* '''Kawasaki:''' A section of historical buildings of the old merchant quarters in Ise that is located along the [[Seta River (Mie)|Seta River]] north of the Ujiyamada Station.
* '''[[Shintomiza]]''' (進富座): An [[independent movie theater]] showing a variety of art-house Japanese and foreign films.  A short walk south of Miyamachi Station.

==Festivals==
* '''Ise Festival:''' Ise's largest festival, held for two days in mid-October to celebrate all things Ise.
* '''Okihiki''' (お木曳): Festival in which the timber that will be used to reconstruct Ise Grand Shrine is ceremonially carried through the streets.  Each neighborhood (or district) of Ise city is responsible for carrying its share of the load, and the ceremony is spread out over many weekends to allow all neighborhoods to participate.  This festival is only held for the three consecutive years starting eight years before a Shrine reconstruction.  For example, the Okihiki festivals for the next Shrine reconstruction in 2013 were held in 2005, 2006, and 2007. Okihiki for the Outer Shrine is held in May and starts on the Miya River.  Okihiki for the Inner Shrine is held in late July and starts near the [[Isuzu River]].
* '''Cherry Blossom Festival''' is held early April on the Miya River (near the Watarai Bridge).
* '''Miya River Fireworks''' is held in mid-July.
* '''Tennō Festival''' is held usually on the Sunday evening of the three-day weekend in July near Kawasaki and is well known for goldfish fireworks at night.
