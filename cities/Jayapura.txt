The city borders the [[Pacific Ocean]] and [[Yos Sudarso Bay]] to the north, the country of [[Papua New Guinea]] to the east, [[Keerom Regency]] to the south, and [[Jayapura Regency]] to the west.

With a population of 398,478 according to the [[2020 Indonesian census|2020 census]],<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> Jayapura is the most populous city in the entire island of [[New Guinea]], surpassing [[Port Moresby]], the national capital and largest city of Papua New Guinea.<ref name="2020census">{{cite web | url=https://papua.bps.go.id/pressrelease/2021/01/21/507/hasil-sensus-penduduk-2020-di-provinsi-papua.html | title=Badan Pusat Statistik }}</ref> During the 2010-2020 decade it was also the fastest-growing city in Indonesia, with the population increasing by 55.23% between 2010 and 2020.<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> The official estimate as at mid 2023 was 414,862 (comprising 220,024 males and 194,838 females).<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Jayapura Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.9171)</ref>

Jayapura is the [[List of Indonesian cities by GDP|fourth largest city by economy]] in [[Eastern Indonesia]]—after [[Makassar]], [[Denpasar]], and [[Manado]]—with an estimated 2016 [[gross domestic product|GDP]] at [[Indonesian rupiah|Rp]]19.48 trillion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Produk Domestik Regional Bruto Kabupaten/Kota di Indonesia 2012-2016|author=Badan Pusat Statistik|author-link=Statistics Indonesia|publisher=Badan Pusat Statistik|year=2017|location=Jakarta}}</ref> Jayapura has a very high [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) at 0.801.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bps.go.id/indicator/26/413/1/-metode-baru-indeks-pembangunan-manusia.html|title = Badan Pusat Statistik}}</ref>

==Etymology==
Jayapura is [[Sanskrit]] for "city of victory" (जय ''jaya'': "victory"; पुर ''pura'': "city") and was named by [[Suharto]] as part of the [[de-Sukarnoization]]. Nowadays there are calls from some citizens, government officials and academicians, to rename the city to better reflect the locals like the naming of [[Youtefa Bridge]]. Some suggestions include ''Kota Tabi'' as the city is in the customary region of Tabi, ''Port Numbay'', or just ''Numbay'' as "Port" is English and not a native word. The word "Numbay" comes from the river Numbay which flows to the city. It has the meaning "clear water" while "Tabi" means "sunrise" in the local [[Kayupulau|Kayo Pulau]] language.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Jubi.co.id|title=Nama Kota Jayapura Diusulkan Diganti Jadi Port Numbay|url=https://www.teras.id/news/pat-20/179668/nama-kota-jayapura-diusulkan-diganti-jadi-port-numbay|website=teras.id|language=id}}</ref><ref name="IMAJI PAPUA 2019">{{cite web | title=NUMBAY, JAYAPURA, TANAH TABI, NEGERI MATAHARI TERBIT | website=IMAJI PAPUA | date=2019-09-18 | url=https://imajipapua.com/2019/09/18/numbay-jayapura-tanah-tabi-negeri-matahari-terbit/ | language=id | access-date=2022-10-15}}</ref>

During the Dutch colonial era the city was called ''Hollandia'', based on the [[Holland]] region. In 1945, the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] made Hollandia the capital of then [[Netherlands New Guinea]]. After the territory was handed over to the [[United Nations Temporary Executive Authority]], on 1 October 1962, the city went by a dual Dutch/Indonesian name: ''Hollandia''/''Kota Baru'' (New Town). When Indonesia took control over the city on 1 May 1963, it became solely ''Kota Baru''. In 1964, the city was briefly renamed ''Sukarnopura'',<ref>In the spelling Sukarn'''a'''pura, the ending "o" of Sukarno's name was replaced by an "a" to name the city after Sukarno in the [[Javanese language|Javanese]], in which the "o" is pronounced [ɔ] but written with "a".</ref> after then-[[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]], until the end of 1968, when it acquired its present name.

==History==
[[File:Hollandia Haven Diverse prauwen, Bestanddeelnr 8047.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''Hollandia Haven'' or Hollandia (now Jayapura) port in 1947]]
Before its inclusion into the colonial government of the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch Indies]], the location of present-day Jayapura was known as ''Numbay''.<ref name="numbay">{{cite news |author=Fabio Maria Lopes Costa |title=Jelajah Sepeda Papua – Jayapura, Cahaya Dari Timur |language=id |url=http://print.kompas.com/baca/2015/06/05/Jayapura%2c-Cahaya-dari-Timur |agency=KOMPAS |work=Jelajah Sepeda Papua |publisher=KOMPAS |location=Jakarta |page=24 |date=5 June 2015 |access-date=6 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304103619/http://print.kompas.com/baca/2015/06/05/Jayapura,-Cahaya-dari-Timur |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Before the arrival of the Dutch there was an active trade in Numbay, centered on the Island of Metui Debi and the area where the former Gereja Pengharapan ("Church of the Favor of God") stood, in Sam Ratulangi Road, being most active between 1897 and 1905. The mode of the trade was through barter for [[spices]], [[cassava]], [[salted fish]] and [[bird-of-paradise]]. The society of Numbay was led by an ''ondoafi'' (chief of the tribe). In the 1800s, Numbay maintained relations with the [[Ternate Sultanate]].<ref name="numbay"/>

On 28 September 1909, a detachment of the Dutch navy under Captain F.J.P. Sachse came ashore at Humboldt Bay near the mouth of the Numbay river. Their task was the systematic exploration of northern New Guinea and the search for a natural border between the Dutch and German spheres on New Guinea. Their camp along the river was called Kloofkamp, a name still in use as the name of an ancient district of Jayapura. Forty coconut trees were cut down for the establishment of the camp. They were bought from the owners at a cost of one [[Dutch rijksdaalder|rijksdaalder]] per palm.

On 7 March 1910, the Dutch flag was raised and the settlement was named ''Hollandia''. On the other side of the bay there was already a German camp, ''Germania-Huk'' (German Corner), which is now uninhabited and part of Indonesian territory. Hollandia was the capital of a district of the same name in the northeast of West New Guinea. The name Hollandia was used until 1962.

The northern part of Netherlands New Guinea was occupied by [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] forces in 1942. [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces drove out the Japanese after [[Operation Reckless|Operations Reckless]] and [[Operation Persecution|Persecution]], the amphibious landings near Hollandia, from 21 April 1944. The area's [[Naval Base Hollandia]], served as General [[Douglas MacArthur]]'s headquarters until the conquest of the [[Philippines]] in March 1945. Over twenty U.S. bases were established and half a million US personnel moved through the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/301932/Jayapura |title=Jayapura |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |access-date=27 May 2010}}</ref>

On 12 May 1949, the [[Roman Catholic]] Apostolic Prefecture of Hollandia was established in the city. In 1963, it was renamed as the Apostolic Vicariate of Kota Baru. In 1964, it was again renamed as the Apostolic Vicariate of Sukarnapura.  It was promoted in 1966 as the Diocese of Sukarnapura, renamed in 1969 as the Diocese of Djajapura and since 1973 spelled as [[Diocese of Jayapura]].

== Economy ==
[[File:Jayapura Bay - panoramio.jpg|thumb|right|Jayapura port activities around Jayapura Bay, 2011]] 
The highest economic growth of Jayapura city compared to other districts/municipalities in the province of Papua has had implications for the increased income and purchasing power of the people. The economic growth is largely contributed from the tertiary sector, where trade and services and finance dominate its contribution to the formation of GRDP.

The sharp gap/disparity of income, and the high rate of poverty (28.44% at less than $3.10/day [[Purchasing power parity|PPP]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=SMERU - Indonesia Poverty Maps|url=http://povertymap.smeru.or.id/map3/provbykab/94_provkab/table|access-date=2020-07-19|website=povertymap.smeru.or.id}}</ref>) and unemployment rate with low labor force participation rate (57.26%). Another weakness is the not yet optimal use of agriculture (in the broad sense) as one of the supporters of the regional economy that has a competitive advantage. Tourism developments, marked by the growing tourism industry and domestic and foreign tourist arrivals in Jayapura City, have provided opportunities for various sectors to flourish, especially income generation for the indigenous people of Port Numbay in Jayapura city.

With the development of trade and service activities supported by the increasing availability of trade and service facilities that lead to increased private investment in the trade and tourism services sector and other sectors. This condition also needs to be supported by the protection policy for the indigenous people of Port Numbay to be prioritized in taking the opportunity to compete healthily, especially in the field of trade, investment and tourism sector.

The economic condition of the indigenous people of Port Numbay, particularly in the context of economic competition in the city of Jayapura, is still at a low level with the lack of capital and skills possessed and with increasingly depleted natural resources.

With the skills and knowledge that still rely on subsistence economic activities such as sago concocting activities, catching fish in the sea, shifting cultivation to indigenous people of Port Numbay, it is enough left behind with other ethnic in Jayapura city that competes in trade and service which is economic modern with profit from the subsistence economy. However, by utilizing the customary rights area along the coast that became the coastal tourist attraction, some of the inhabitants of Port Numbay Original have competed in the service sector even on a small scale and limited capital. This is done by indigenous villagers Kayu Batu on BaseG beach in North Jayapura, Hamadi beach in South Jayapura and on Holtekam beach, Skow Mabo and Skow in Muara Tami district.

While competition in the field of trade is still limited to the natives of Port Numbay because it is still in small scale and is subsistence economy. Among other things, the sale of crops such as marine fish, long-term crops such as coconut, [[areca nut]] and others that more levels of economic competition with other ethnic Jayapura in the same merchandise, and with a larger scale.
