It is the [[List of cities and towns in Russia by population|seventh-largest city]] in Russia, with a population of over 1.1 million people, and the second-largest city in the [[Ural Federal District]], after [[Yekaterinburg]]. Chelyabinsk is located to the East behind the South part of the [[Ural Mountains]] and runs along the [[Miass (river)|Miass River]]. 

The area of Chelyabinsk contained the ancient settlement of [[Arkaim]], which belonged to the [[Sintashta culture]]. In 1736, a fortress by the name of Chelyaba was founded on the site of a [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] village. Chelyabinsk was granted town status by 1787. Chelyabinsk began to grow rapidly by the early 20th century as a result of the construction of [[railway]] links from the [[European Russia|Russian core]] to [[Siberia]], including the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. Its population reached 70,000 by 1917. Under the [[Soviet Union]], Chelyabinsk became a major industrial centre during the 1930s. The [[Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant]] was built in 1933. During [[World War II]], the city was a major contributor to the manufacture of [[tank]]s and ammunition.

In the 1990s and 2000s, a number of industries in Chelyabinsk ceased to exist due to the difficult economic situation,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cheladmin.ru/istoriya-chelyabinska |website=History of Chelyabinsk |publisher=Administration of Chelyabinsk |access-date=4 September 2023 |title=История Челябинска &#124; Администрация г.

Nevertheless, it is one of the largest industrial centers of the Urals, where industry accounts for almost 40% of the gross municipal product, especially heavy industries such as [[metallurgy]] and military production. It is home to several educational institutions, mainly [[South Ural State University]] and [[Chelyabinsk State University]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://translate.google.com/website?sl=auto&tl=en&hl=en&u=https://cheladmin.ru/sites/default/files/imceFiles/user704/pasport_na_sayt_0.pdf |publisher=Administration of Chelyabinsk (2020) |access-date=4 September 2023}}</ref>

==History==
===Ancient Sintashta civilization===
Archaeologists have discovered ruins of the ancient town of [[Arkaim]] in the vicinity of the city of Chelyabinsk. Ruins and artifacts in Arkaim and other sites in the region indicate a relatively advanced civilization existing in the area since the 2nd millennium BC, which was of [[proto-Indo-Iranian]] origin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pravdareport.com/science/8582-arkaim/|title=Ancient Aryan civilization achieved incredible technological progress 40 centuries ago|date=16 July 2005|publisher=Pravda}}</ref>

The Arkaim site, located in the [[Sintashta|Sintashta-Petrovka]] cultural area, was known by Russian archaeologists for at least 70 years, however, it was mostly ignored by non-Russian anthropological circles. The borders of the [[Sintashta|Sintashta-Petrovka]] cultural area run along the eastern Urals of the [[Eurasian steppe]] to about {{Cvt|400|km|4=0}} south of Chelyabinsk and to the east for about {{Cvt|200|km|4=0}}. 23 archaeological sites are recognized as being part of this area.

The sites resemble towns, laid out in round, square, or oval shapes. Although most of the sites have been discovered by aerial photography, only two, Arkaim and Sintashta, have been thoroughly excavated. These sites are characterized by their fortification, connected houses, and extensive evidence of metallurgy.<ref name="Basu 2017 23">{{cite book

The people of the Sintashta culture are thought to have spoken [[Proto-Indo-Iranian]], the ancestor of the [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian language family]]. This identification is based primarily on similarities between their language in comparison to sections of the ''[[Rigveda]]'', and based on funerary rituals of the Sintashta culture, as revealed by archaeological studies in the area.<ref name="Anthony 2007 pp. 408-411">{{Harvnb|Anthony|2007|pp=408–411}}.</ref><ref name="Basu 2017 23"/>

===Modern Russian history===
The fortress of Chelyaba, from which the city takes its name, was founded at the location of the [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] village of Chelyaby ({{lang-ba|Силәбе, Siläbe}}) by colonel Alexey (Kutlu-Muhammed) Tevkelev in 1736<ref name=Brit/> to protect the surrounding trade routes from possible attacks by [[Bashkirs|Bashkir]] outlaws. During [[Pugachev's Rebellion]], the fortress withstood a siege by the rebel forces in 1774, but was eventually captured for several months in 1775. In 1782, Chelyabinsk became a seat of the [[uyezd]] of [[Ufa Viceroyalty]], which was later reformed into [[Orenburg Governorate]]. In 1787, Chelyabinsk was granted town status by the government.

[[File:Торговый дом купца М. Ф. Валеева.JPG|thumb|left|Valeyev's trading house (1911)]]
Until the late 19th century, Chelyabinsk was a small provincial town. In 1892, the [[Kuybyshev Railway|Samara-Zlatoust Railway]] was completed, which connected it with Moscow and the rest of European Russia. Also in 1892, construction of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] started from Chelyabinsk, and in 1896, the city was linked to [[Ekaterinburg]]. Chelyabinsk then became the main hub for travel to Siberia. For 15 years, more than fifteen million people – a tenth of Russia's population at the time – passed through Chelyabinsk. Some of them remained in Chelyabinsk, which contributed to its rapid growth. In addition, a so-called "customs fracture" was created in Chelyabinsk, which imposed duties on the shipment of goods between the European and Asian parts of Russia, which led to the emergence of mills and notably, a tea-packing factory. As a result, Chelyabinsk became a major trade center. Its population reached 20,000 inhabitants by 1897, 45,000 by 1913, and 70,000 by 1917. Because of its rapid growth at the turn of the 20th century, similar to that of midwestern American cities, Chelyabinsk was sometimes called "the [[Chicago]] of the Urals".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chelindustry.ru/info.php?tt=19&ids=9&rr=5|title=Челябинск: Ворота в Сибирь и Зауральский Чикаго|publisher=Портал Челябинская область|access-date=6 July 2014|archive-date=18 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110418032050/http://www.chelindustry.ru/info.php?tt=19&rr=5&ids=9|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the first [[Five-year plans of the Soviet Union|five-year plans]] of the 1930s, Chelyabinsk experienced rapid industrial growth. Several important factories, including the [[Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant]] and the Chelyabinsk Metallurgical Plant, were built at this time. During [[World War II]], [[Joseph Stalin]] decided to move a large part of Soviet manufacturing to areas removed from the reach of the advancing German military as part of a [[Evacuation in the Soviet Union|general exodus]] from western occupied areas. This brought new industries and thousands of workers to Chelyabinsk, including facilities for the production of [[T-34]] tanks and [[Katyusha rocket launcher]]s. During World War II, the city's industries produced 18,000 tanks and 48,500 tank diesel engines as well as over 17 million units of ammunition. During that time Chelyabinsk was informally called "[[Tankograd]]" ("Tank City"). During World War II, the [[S.M. Kirov Factory no. 185]] or "OKMO" was moved to Chelyabinsk from [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] to produce heavy tanks, although it was transferred to [[Omsk]] after 1962.

===2013 meteor===
{{Main|Chelyabinsk meteor}}
Shortly after dawn on 15&nbsp;February 2013, a [[superbolide]] [[meteor]] descended at over {{convert|55000|km/h|sp=us}} over the [[Ural Mountains]], exploding at an altitude of {{convert|25|-|30|km|sp=us}}.<ref>{{cite interview |last=Campbell-Brown |first=Margaret |interviewer=John Matson |title=What Do We Know about the Russian Meteor?

The meteor created a momentary flash as bright as the sun and generated a shock wave that injured over a thousand people. Fragments fell in and around Chelyabinsk. Interior Ministry spokesman [[Vadim Kolesnikov (official)|Vadim Kolesnikov]] said 1,100 people had called for medical assistance following the incident, mostly for treatment of injuries from broken glass by the explosions. One woman suffered a broken spine.{{cn|date=December 2020}} Kolesnikov also said about {{convert|600|m2|sigfig=1|sp=us}} of a roof at a [[zinc]] factory had collapsed. A spokeswoman for the Emergency Ministry told the [[Associated Press]] that there was a [[meteor shower]]; however, another ministry spokeswoman was quoted by the [[Interfax]] news agency as saying it was a single meteor.<ref name="Slate">{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/bad_astronomy/2013/02/15/breaking_huge_meteor_explodes_over_russia.html|title=Breaking: Huge Meteor Blazes Across Sky Over Russia; Sonic Boom Shatters Windows [UPDATED]|publisher=Slate|first=Phil|last=Plait|date=15 February 2013|access-date=15 February 2013}}</ref><ref name="pravda-123799">{{cite web|title=Meteor strikes Earth in Russia's Urals|date=15 February 2013|url=http://english.pravda.ru/news/hotspots/15-02-2013/123799-meteorite_russia-0/|publisher=Pravda|access-date=15 February 2013}}</ref><ref name="AP400">{{cite news |title=400 Injured by Meteorite Falls in Russian Urals|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/EU_RUSSIA_METEORITE |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=15 February 2013}}</ref> The size has been estimated at {{convert|17|m|sp=us}} diameter with a mass of {{Convert|10000 to 11000|t|lb|sp=us}}.<ref name="NASA-20130215">{{cite web |last=Agle |first=D.

The city avoided larger casualties and destruction due to the shallow entry angle of the meteor, which caused a relatively high altitude for the explosion and distributed its energy over a larger area.

== Geography ==
Chelyabinsk is located east of the [[Ural Mountains]], {{Convert|200|km|4=0}} south of [[Yekaterinburg]]. It is elevated {{Convert|200-250|m|4=0}} above sea level.

The city is bisected by the [[Miass River]], which is regarded as the border between the Urals and [[Siberia]]. This is reflected in the geology of the area, with the [[granite]] foothills of the Ural Mountains to the west and the lower [[sedimentary rock]] of the [[West Siberian Plain]] to the east.

The Leningrad Bridge crosses the river, due to this it is known as "the bridge between the Urals and Siberia". Chelyabinsk itself is also known as "the gateway to Siberia".<ref>{{cite web

Like [[Rome]], [[Constantinople]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Moscow]], Chelyabinsk is said to be located on seven hills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mediazavod.ru/articles/4501|title=Холмы Челябинска|publisher=Электронное периодическое издание Mediazavod.ru|access-date=9 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714171229/http://mediazavod.ru/articles/4501|archive-date=14 July 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Urban layout===
The city of Chelyabinsk developed as a fortress. The first streets began to appear soon after the construction of the fortress on the right (southern) bank of the Miass River - already in September 1736. No residential buildings were built directly in the fortress itself; the houses of the inhabitants were located in the adjoining settlement, which was surrounded by a defensive wall. The very first street was formed between the northern wall of the fortress and the Miass River. A fragment of it is shown already in the foreground of the Chelyabinsk Fortress, attached by Colonel A.I. Tevkelev to his report to V.N. Tatishchev on 10 September 1736. Soon it received the name Sibirskaya (now Truda Street), since outside Chelyabinsk it crossed into the Siberian tract leading to [[Tobolsk]]. Apparently, there were also other names: in a number of sources it is called Bolshaya Beregovaya, as mentioned in a document dated 10 March 1753.<ref>[https://znanio.ru/media/ulitsy-chelyabinska-xviii-veka-progulka-po-gorodu-2762106 Улицы Челябинска XVIII века: прогулка по городу]</ref> The western end of the street in the last years of the 18th century acquired an independent name – on the pasture near the outskirts of the Ivanovo fair appeared.<ref>[https://miasskiy.ru/20190221-chto-my-znaem-ob-istoricheskom-oblike-stolicy-yuzhnogo-urala то мы знаем об историческом облике столицы Южного Урала?, Missayski Rabochi]</ref> Apparently, according to it, this part of the street began to be called Sibirskaya-Ivanovskaya (as it is called in the list of 1795). Then, already in the 19th century, it was a little later upstream and downstream of the Miass (that is, west and east of the fortress). Perpendicular to the river, several more streets were planned. At first, there were four of them – two each on the western and eastern sides. The first street to the east got its name from the first Chelyabinsk church, consecrated in 1739 in honor of [[Saint Nicholas of Myra|Nicholas the Wonderworker]] – Nikolayevskaya street (nowadays Sovetskaya). It was one-sided and went west towards the church and the fortress. After the Chelyabinsk fortress was assigned the status of the center of the Isetskaya province in 1743, the construction of administrative buildings began here, and another street was formed between Nikolaevskaya Street and the square with the church, ending in the south with the Orenburg Gate and continuing further after the then city limit by the road to Orenburg - Orenburgskaya (now Tsvillinga Street). On Orenburgskaya Street, in 1787 only four courtyards were counted, and in the list of 1795 it was already called Khristorozhdestvenskaya, and there were eleven courtyards on it. In the 18th and first half of the 19th century, Khristorozhdestvenskaya Street was the main street in the city, it was the place where its social and business life was concentrated. The urban planning on the territory of the historical center of Chelyabinsk almost without changes coincides with the plan of Chelyabinsk in 1838. The Chelyabinsk fortress was built in the center of this territory in 1736.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://arhistrazh.livejournal.com/7790.html| title=Памятники истории и культуры / Исторический центр Челябинска.

Vasyenko street| author=yuvlatyshev| date=21 August 2016| lang=ru}}</ref> The plan of 1784 was supposed to streamline not only the layout of the city but the development and maintenance of quarters. Along with the city center, a district center and a second city square are being laid in the riverside part. The plans of 1768 and 1784 were not carried out, though the existing Troitskaya Square, Truda Street and Tsvilinga Street are historical traces remained of them. In 1838, the land surveyor Sidorov drew up a new plan to streamline the city. In many ways, it was the starting point for the further development of the city.

By 1934, during the Soviet period and the mass industrialization, about 250 thousand people lived in the city. Large-scale urban planning tasks necessitated the development of the first master plan of the city, executed under the guidance of the architect N. G. Eismont in 1936 (Leningrad-based [[Russian State Research and Design Institute of Urbanism]], architects N. G. Berlinerblau, S. M. Gotlib, N. V. Gromov, K. M. Zaichenko and A. M. Suborov). The estimated population according to the general plan of 1936 was to reach 550 thousand people. The city developed around the historical core, including by cutting down the island birch forest, in the planning of the central part, a rectangular grid of streets was preserved, but with the enlargement of quarters. The Metallurgichesky, Traktorozavodsky and Leninsky districts were built and developed with heavy industry. Along with the city center, the centers of 5 administrative districts were planned, and interconnected by a system of transport highways. The main street – Spartak Street (now Lenin Avenue) – appears as a link between the Traktorozavodsky district, Revolution Square, and the future ensemble of the pre-park square. Historically developed streets of Kirov and Zwilling connected the main square of the city with the system of squares in Zarechye. The master plan of 1936 provided for the creation of urban recreation areas on the basis of Shershnevsky Bor and Lake Smolino, for the first time the issue of creating a large reservoir on the Miass River (Shershnevskoye Reservoir) was raised.<ref name="GenPlan">{{cite web| url=https://chelchel-ru.livejournal.com/1600951.html| title=ГЕНЕРАЛЬНЫЙ ПЛАН ЧЕЛЯБИНСКА| trans-title=Chelyabinsk General Plan| author=O. Shelnikova| date=7 October 2020| lang=ru}}</ref> 

The war prevented the implementation of the master plan in full. The Chelyabinsk industrial complex has become a deep rear defense base of the country. The relocation of 60 industrial enterprises from the center of the country, and the evacuation of the population were accompanied by mass construction of isolated villages from barracks and dugouts in free territories. At the same time, the urban area has grown significantly. The need to streamline the development of the post-war city is one of the driving reasons for the development of a new master plan, carried out in 1947 under the leadership of D. D. Bagarin (Lengiprogor, architects A. Slonimsky, L. Vertousov, engineers J. Rotenberg, I. Benevich and others). The second general plan is designed for a city with a population of more than 700 thousand people (in 1946, 450 thousand people lived in the city). Chelyabinsk was considered a center of energy-intensive production, so the main attention was paid to the formation of four industrial hubs based on the capacities of existing enterprises.<ref name="GenPlan"/> The main architectural and planning idea was the unification of disparate parts of the city into a single organism – was transferred from the general plan of the pre-war period. Along with the territory of the districts that had reserves for development (Traktorozavodsky – towards Lake First, Metallurgical – with partial use of the territory of Kashtaksky Bor, Leninsky – to Lake Smolino), new sites for promising construction were envisaged (North-West and Churilovo). The issues of transport construction were actively resolved: the creation of a bypass ring highway connecting the city districts, the routing of the main highways from east to west (Pobedy Avenue, Khudyakov – Dzerzhinsky) and from north to south ("Meridian" and Tchaikovsky Street) with access to the main roads beyond outside the city. In 1951, the master plan was adjusted in terms of the number of floors of the building: the share of multi-storey (up to five floors) buildings increased by reducing the share of 2-storey and estate buildings to 25%. 

The third master plan of the city in 1967 was developed by a team of authors from the Chelyabinskgrazhdanproekt Institute. The city had a population of 857,000. The main architectural and planning idea was the active inclusion in the composition of the city of Shershnevsky and Kashtak forests, the Shershnevsky reservoir and the Miass River. Building on the free territories of the northwestern residential area, designed for a population of up to 300 thousand people, as a new direction for the development of the city, proposed by the master plan, has been carried out since the late 1960s. The existing historically polycentric system of the center was enriched by the creation of new complexes: at the turn of the river near Garden Island, along Tchaikovsky Street, and the three-beam center of the northwest. The master plan of 1967 provided for the creation of new main streets and a ring road, and the construction of bridges and overpasses, which were planned to free the city center from transit traffic. In 1990 a new city plan was approved and again in 2021.<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.1obl.ru/news/ekonomika/v-chelyabinske-utverzhdayut-novyy-genplan-na-20-let/| title=В Челябинске утверждают новый генплан на 20 лет| trans-title=A new general plan for 20 years is approved in Chelyabinsk| author=Карина Кальярова| date=21 December 2021| lang=ru}}</ref>

===Climate===

July has a relatively warm average of {{convert|19|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}, and the annual average is a few degrees above the freezing point at {{convert|3|°C|°F|1|disp=or}}, indicating some moderation. The range of extremes allegedly reaches {{convert|70|C-change|F-change|disp=or}}, claimed to be typical of a mid-latitude climate on a large continent such as [[Eurasia]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=592440&cityname=Chelyabinsk,+Russia|title=Chelyabinsk, Russia Köppen Climate Classification (Weatherbase)|website=Weatherbase|access-date=13 November 2018}}</ref>

The majority of precipitation occurs in the summer, with less in the winter. The month of July experiences the most, with an average {{convert|87|mm|in|2|disp=or}} of precipitation, while January, the driest month, experiences {{convert|15|mm|in|2|disp=or}}. Total precipitation reaches an average of {{convert|429|mm|in|2|disp=or}} annually, consistent with the city's [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] influence.

The architecture of Chelyabinsk has been shaped through its history by the progression of historical eras in [[Russia]]. Before the [[Russian Revolution|1917 Russian Revolution]], the city was a trading center, with numerous merchant buildings in the [[eclecticism in architecture|eclectic]] and [[modern architecture|modern]] styles with elements of [[Russian Revival architecture]], some of which are preserved on the pedestrian-only Kirovka Street.
[[Industrialization]] in Chelyabinsk started in the late 1920s. The construction of large plants was accompanied by the construction of new residential and public buildings (like the city's main post office) in the [[constructivist architecture|constructivist]] style. Entire constructivist neighborhoods can be seen in the area of the [[Chelyabinsk Tractor Plant]].<ref>{{cite web|url= http://nobelfaik.livejournal.com/5686.html |script-title=ru:Конструктивизм в архитектуре Челябинска |language= ru|date=27 April 2009 }}</ref>

In the late 1930s, a new era began in the city, with large-scale construction of [[Stalinist architecture]]. Many of the buildings in and around the city center and central avenue are constructed in this style.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nashural.ru/Goroda_i_sela/progulka-po-centru-chelyabinska.htm|title=Сталинский ампир.|date=16 January 2016}}</ref>

The next 60 years saw extensive construction of residential [[high-rise building]]s as the city's population rose to about one million, notably within the large residential area called "Severo-Zapad" ("North-West").

With the market reforms of the 1990s, there was an increase in the construction of office buildings and major shopping malls in [[postmodern architecture|postmodern]] and [[high-tech architecture|high-tech]] styles.

===Parks and gardens===
Chelyabinsk has 17 public parks. The largest is [[Gagarin]] Central Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chel.aif.ru/society/ecology/1192790|title=Парк Гагарина в Челябинске попал в топ-5 лучших в России.}}</ref> Its territory includes large areas of rocky and forested terrain, located around several now-flooded abandoned quarries.
