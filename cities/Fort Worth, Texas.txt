A line of seven army posts was established in 1848–1849 after the Mexican War to protect the settlers of Texas along the western American Frontier and included Fort Worth, [[Fort Graham]], [[Fort Gates]], [[Fort Croghan]], [[Fort Martin Scott]], [[Fort Lincoln, Texas|Fort Lincoln]], and [[Fort Duncan]].<ref name=Crimmins>Crimmins, M.L., 1943, "The First Line of Army Posts Established in West Texas in 1849," Abilene: West Texas Historical Association, Vol. XIX, pp. 121–127</ref> Originally, 10 forts had been proposed by Major General [[William J. Worth|William Jenkins Worth]] (1794–1849), who commanded the [[Department of Texas]] in 1849. In January 1849, Worth proposed a line of 10 forts to mark the western Texas frontier from [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]] to the confluence of the West Fork and Clear Fork of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]]. One month later, Worth died from [[cholera]] in South Texas.<ref name=Crimmins />

General [[William S. Harney]] assumed command of the Department of Texas and ordered Major [[Ripley A. Arnold]] (Company F, Second United States Dragoons)<ref name=Crimmins /> to find a new fort site near the West Fork and Clear Fork. On June 6, 1849, Arnold, advised by Middleton Tate Johnson, established a camp on the bank of the Trinity River and named the post Camp Worth in honor of the late General Worth. In August 1849, Arnold moved the camp to the north-facing bluff, which overlooked the mouth of the Clear Fork of the Trinity River. The United States War Department officially named the post Fort Worth on November 14, 1849.<ref name="tshaFtWrth">{{cite web |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdf01 |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |title=Fort Worth, TX |access-date=June 9, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141009100347/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hdf01 |archive-date=October 9, 2014}}</ref> Since its establishment, the city of Fort Worth continues to be known as "where the West begins".<ref name=":3" />

The fort was abandoned September 17, 1853.<ref name=Crimmins /> No trace of it remains.

As a stop on the legendary [[Chisholm Trail]], Fort Worth was stimulated by the business of the cattle drives and became a brawling, bustling town. Millions of head of cattle were driven north to market along this trail. Fort Worth became the center of the [[cattle drive]]s, and later, the [[ranch]]ing industry. It was given the nickname of Cowtown.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sightlines.usitt.org/archive/2013/07/CowtownNoMore.asp |title=A Brief History Of "Cowtown" |last1=Shurr |first1=Elizabeth |last2=Hagler |first2=Jack P. |publisher=United States Institute for Theatre Technology, Inc. |date=July 2013 |access-date=November 3, 2017 |archive-date=December 1, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161201020840/http://sightlines.usitt.org/archive/2013/07/CowtownNoMore.asp |url-status=live }}</ref>

During the [[American Civil War]], Fort Worth suffered from shortages of money, food, and supplies. The population dropped as low as 175, but began to recover during [[Reconstruction era|Reconstruction]]. By 1872, Jacob Samuels, William Jesse Boaz, and William Henry Davis had opened general stores. The next year, Khleber M. Van Zandt established Tidball, Van Zandt, and Company, which became Fort Worth National Bank in 1884.

In 1875, the ''[[Dallas Herald]]'' published an article by a former Fort Worth lawyer, Robert E. Cowart, who wrote that the decimation of Fort Worth's population, caused by the economic disaster and hard winter of 1873, had dealt a severe blow to the cattle industry. Added to the slowdown due to the railroad's stopping the laying of track {{convert|30|mi|km}} outside of Fort Worth, Cowart said that Fort Worth was so slow that he saw a [[cougar|panther]] <!-- (cougar, mountain lion) --> asleep in the street by the courthouse. Although an intended insult, the name Panther City was enthusiastically embraced when in 1876 Fort Worth recovered economically.<ref name="panthercity">{{cite news |title=History of Panther Mascot |url=http://www.pantherfountain.com/dallas_daily_herald.asp |publisher=The Panther Foundation |date=May 2009 |access-date=May 9, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826220421/http://www.pantherfountain.com/dallas_daily_herald.asp |archive-date=August 26, 2009}}</ref> Many businesses and organizations continue to use Panther in their name.

The "Panther City" tradition is also preserved in the names and design of some of the city's geographical/architectural features, such as Panther Island (in the Trinity River), the Flat Iron Building, [[Fort Worth Central Station]], and in two or three "Sleeping Panther" statues.

With the boom times came a variety of entertainments and related problems. Fort Worth had a knack for separating cattlemen from their money. Cowboys took full advantage of their last brush with civilization before the long drive on the [[Chisholm Trail]] from Fort Worth  north to [[Kansas]]. They stocked up on provisions from local merchants, visited saloons for a bit of gambling and carousing, then rode northward with their cattle, only to whoop it up again on their way back. The town soon became home to "[[Hell's Half Acre (Fort Worth)|Hell's Half-Acre]]", the biggest collection of saloons, dance halls, and bawdy houses south of [[Dodge City, Kansas|Dodge City]] (the northern terminus of the Chisholm Trail), giving Fort Worth the nickname of the "Paris of the Plains".<ref>Julia Kathryn Garrett, ''Fort Worth: A Frontier Triumph'' (Austin: Encino, 1972)</ref><ref>Mack H. Williams, ''In Old Fort Worth: The Story of a City and Its People as published in the ''News-Tribune'' in 1976 and 1977'' (1977). Mack H. Williams, comp., The News-Tribune in Old Fort Worth (Fort Worth: News-Tribune, 1975)</ref>

Certain sections of town were off-limits for proper citizens. Shootings, knifings, muggings, and brawls became a nightly occurrence. Cowboys were joined by a motley assortment of buffalo hunters, gunmen, adventurers, and crooks. Hell's Half Acre (also known as simply "The Acre") expanded as more people were drawn to the town. Occasionally, the Acre was referred to as "the bloody Third Ward" after it was designated one of the city's three political wards in 1876. By 1900, the Acre covered four of the city's main north-south thoroughfares.<ref name=":0">{{cite web |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hph01 |title=Hell's Half Acre, Fort Worth |website=Handbook of Texas Online |access-date=December 30, 2017 |archive-date=November 15, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115220641/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/hph01 |url-status=live }}</ref> Local citizens became alarmed about the activities, electing [[Jim Courtright (gunman)|Timothy Isaiah "Longhair Jim" Courtright]] in 1876 as [[Marshal|city marshal]] with a mandate to tame it.

Courtright sometimes collected and jailed 30 people on a Saturday night, but allowed the gamblers to operate, as they attracted money to the city. After learning that train and stagecoach robbers, such as the [[Sam Bass (outlaw)|Sam Bass]] gang, were using the area as a hideout, he intensified law enforcement, but certain businessmen advertised against too many restrictions in the area as having bad effects on the legitimate businesses. Gradually, the cowboys began to avoid the area; as businesses suffered, the city moderated its opposition. Courtright lost his office in 1879.<ref name=":0" />

Despite crusading mayors such as [[H.S. Broiles]] and newspaper editors such as B. B. Paddock, the Acre survived because it generated income for the city (all of it illegal) and excitement for visitors. Longtime Fort Worth residents claimed the place was never as wild as its reputation, but during the 1880s, Fort Worth was a regular stop on the "gambler's circuit" by [[Bat Masterson]], [[Doc Holliday]], and the [[Earp brothers]] (Wyatt, Morgan, and Virgil).<ref name=":0" /> [[James Earp]], the eldest of his brothers, lived with his wife in Fort Worth during this period; their house was at the edge of Hell's Half Acre, at 9th and Calhoun. He often tended bar at the Cattlemen's Exchange saloon in the "uptown" part of the city.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Wyatt Earp's cow-boy campaign : the bloody restoration of law and order along the Mexican border, 1882 |last=Hornung |first=Chuck |publisher=McFarland & Company |year=2016 |location=Jefferson, NC |page=12}}</ref>

Reforming citizens objected to the [[dance hall]]s, where men and women mingled; by contrast, the saloons or gambling parlors had primarily male customers.

In the late 1880s, Mayor Broiles and County Attorney R. L. Carlock initiated a reform campaign. In a public shootout on February 8, 1887, Jim Courtright was killed on Main Street by [[Luke Short]], who claimed he was "King of Fort Worth Gamblers".<ref name=":0" /> As Courtright had been popular, when Short was jailed for his murder, rumors floated of lynching him. Short's good friend Bat Masterson came armed and spent the night in his cell to protect him.

The first [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] campaign in Texas was mounted in Fort Worth in 1889, allowing other business and residential development in the area. Another change was the influx of [[African American|Black and African American]] residents. Excluded by state [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] from the business end of town and the more costly residential areas, the city's black citizens settled into the southern portion of the city. The popularity and profitability of the Acre declined and more derelicts and the homeless were seen on the streets. By 1900, most of the dance halls and gamblers were gone. Cheap variety shows and prostitution became the chief forms of entertainment. Some progressive politicians launched an offensive to seek out and abolish these perceived "vices" as part of the broader [[Progressive Era]] package of reforms.<ref name=":0" />

In 1911, the Reverend [[J. Frank Norris]] launched an offensive against racetrack gambling in the ''Baptist Standard'' and used the pulpit of the First Baptist Church of Fort Worth to attack vice and prostitution. When he began to link certain Fort Worth businessmen with property in the Acre and announced their names from his pulpit, the battle heated up. On February 4, 1912, Norris's church was burned to the ground; that evening, his enemies tossed a bundle of burning oiled rags onto his porch, but the fire was extinguished and caused minimal damage. A month later, the [[arson]]ists succeeded in burning down the [[Clergy house|parsonage]]. In a sensational trial lasting a month, Norris was charged with [[perjury]] and arson in connection with the two fires. He was acquitted, but his continued attacks on the Acre accomplished little until 1917. A new city administration and the federal government, which was eyeing Fort Worth as a potential site for a [[Camp Bowie|major military training camp]], joined forces with the Baptist preacher to bring down the final curtain on the Acre.

The police department compiled statistics showing that 50% of the violent crime in Fort Worth occurred in the Acre, which confirmed respectable citizens' opinion of the area. After Camp Bowie (a World War I [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] training installation) was located on the outskirts of Fort Worth in 1917, the military used [[martial law]] to regulate prostitutes and barkeepers of the Acre. Fines and stiff jail sentences curtailed their activities. By the time Norris held a mock funeral parade to "bury [[John Barleycorn]]" in 1919, the Acre had become a part of Fort Worth history. The name continues to be associated with the southern end of Fort Worth.<ref>''Fort Worth Daily Democrat'', April 10, 1878, April 18, 1879, July 18, 1881.

In 1921, the whites-only union workers in the Fort Worth, Swift & Co. meatpacking plant in the Niles City Stockyards went on strike. The owners attempted to replace them with black [[strikebreakers]]. During union protests, strikebreaker African-American [[Lynching of Fred Rouse|Fred Rouse was lynched]] on a tree at the corner of NE 12th Street and Samuels Avenue. After he was hanged a white mob riddled his mutilated body with gunshots.{{sfn|Tarrant County Coalition for Peace and Justice|2021|p=}}

On [[2000 Fort Worth tornado|March 28, 2000]], at 6:15 pm, an [[Fujita scale|F3 tornado]] struck downtown Fort Worth, severely damaging many buildings.

The original approach to the Tanglewood area consisted of a two-rut dirt road, which is now Bellaire Drive South. Up to the time of development, children enjoyed swimming in the river in a deep hole that was located where the bridge is now on Bellaire Drive South near Trinity Commons Shopping Center. The portions of Tanglewood that are now Bellaire Park Court, Marquette Court, and Autumn Court were originally a dairy farm.

The ''Fort Worth Press'' was a daily newspaper, published weekday afternoons and on Sundays from 1921 until 1975. It was owned by the [[E. W. Scripps Company]] and published under the then-prominent Scripps-Howard Lighthouse logo. The paper reportedly last made money in the early 1950s. Scripps Howard stayed with the paper until mid-1975. Circulation had dwindled to fewer than 30,000 daily, just more than 10% of that of the ''Fort Worth Star Telegram''. The name ''Fort Worth Press'' was resurrected briefly in a new ''Fort Worth Press'' paper operated by then-former publisher Bill McAda and briefer still by William Dean Singleton, then-owner of the weekly ''Azle (Texas) News'', now owner of the Media Central news group. The ''Fort Worth Press'' operated from offices and presses at 500 Jones Street in Downtown Fort Worth.<ref>{{cite web |title=MAYBORN, WARD CARLTON |url=https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fma88 |access-date=February 13, 2012 |publisher=The Handbook of Texas Online |archive-date=January 12, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112101807/http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fma88 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== History ===

==== Electric streetcars ====
[[File:Map Showing Lines of the Northern Texas Electric Company (Fort Worth) c 1907.png|thumb|"Map showing lines of the Northern Texas Electric Company (Fort Worth)", {{Circa|1907}}]]
[[File:Interurban Line between Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas.jpg|thumb|Interurban line between Fort Worth and Dallas, Texas (postcard, ''circa'' 1902–1924)]]

The first streetcar company in Fort Worth was the Fort Worth Street Railway Company. Its first line began operating in December 1876, and traveled from the courthouse down Main Street to the T&P Depot.<ref>{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Oliver |title=Fort Worth: Outpost on the Trinity |publisher=Texas Christian University Press |location=Fort Worth |isbn=0-87565-077-5 |page=85 |year=1990}}</ref> By 1890, more than 20 private companies were operating streetcar lines in Fort Worth. The Fort Worth Street Railway Company bought out many of its competitors, and was eventually itself bought out by the Bishop & Sherwin Syndicate in 1901.<ref>{{cite book |last=Knight |first=Oliver |title=Fort Worth: Outpost on the Trinity |publisher=Texas Christian University Press |location=Fort Worth |isbn=0-87565-077-5 |page=133 |year=1990}}</ref> The new ownership changed the company's name to the [[Northern Texas Traction Company]], which operated 84 miles of streetcar railways in 1925, and their lines connected downtown Fort Worth to TCU, the [[Near Southside, Fort Worth|Near Southside]], Arlington Heights, Lake Como, and the [[Fort Worth Stockyards|Stockyards]].

==== Electric interurban railways ====
At its peak, the electric interurban industry in Texas consisted of almost 500 miles of track, making Texas the second in interurban mileage in all states west of the Mississippi River. Electric interurban railways were prominent in the early 1900s, peaking in the 1910s and fading until all electric interurban railways were abandoned by 1948. Close to three-fourths of the mileage was in the Dallas–Fort Worth area, running between Fort Worth and Dallas and to other area cities including Cleburne, Denison, Corsicana, and Waco. The line depicted in the associated image was the second to be constructed in Texas and ran 35 miles between Fort Worth and Dallas. [[Northern Texas Traction Company]] built the railway, which was operational from 1902 to 1934.<ref>Robert A. Rieder, "Electric Interurban Railways," Handbook of Texas Online [https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eqe12] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180719084222/https://tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/eqe12|date=July 19, 2018}}, accessed March 23, 2012.

*[[Trinity Railway Express]] is a commuter rail line that operates between [[T&P Station]] in downtown Fort Worth and terminates at [[Dallas Union Station]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trinityrailwayexpress.org/stations.html |title=Stations |work=trinityrailwayexpress.org |access-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-date=March 3, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235000/http://www.trinityrailwayexpress.org/stations.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

==== Airports ====
[[Dallas Fort Worth International Airport]] is a major commercial airport located between the major cities of Fort Worth and Dallas. DFW Airport is the world's third-busiest airport based on operations and tenth-busiest airport based on passengers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dfwairport.com/visitor/P1_009559.php |title=dfwairport.com - DFW Fast Facts |work=dfwairport.com |access-date=March 3, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150712183001/https://www.dfwairport.com/visitor/P1_009559.php |archive-date=July 12, 2015}}</ref>

Prior to the construction of the DFW Airport, the city was served by [[Greater Southwest International Airport]], which was located just to the south of the new airport. Originally named Amon Carter Field after the publisher of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, Greater Southwest opened in 1953 and operated as the primary airport for Fort Worth until 1974. It was then abandoned until the terminal was torn down in 1980. The site of the former airport is now a mixed-use development straddled by [[Texas State Highway 183]] and [[Texas State Highway 360|360]]. One small section of runway remains north of Highway 183, and serves as the only reminder that a major commercial airport once occupied the site.

Fort Worth is home to these four airports within city limits:
* [[Fort Worth Alliance Airport]]
* [[Fort Worth Meacham International Airport]]
* [[Fort Worth Spinks Airport]]
* [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth]]

==== Walkability ====
A 2011 study by [[Walk Score]] ranked Fort Worth 47th-most walkable of 50 largest U.S. cities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/ |title=2011 City and Neighborhood Rankings |publisher=Walk Score |year=2011 |access-date=August 28, 2011 |archive-date=August 4, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120804175531/http://www.walkscore.com/rankings/cities/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
