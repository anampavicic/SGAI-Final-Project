It is the northernmost major city in the United States, located about {{convert|100|mi}} south of the [[Canada–United States border|Canadian border]].

[[Logging]] was Seattle's first major industry, but by the late 19th century the city had become a commercial and shipbuilding center as a gateway to [[Alaska]] during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]]. The city grew after [[World War II]], partly due to the local [[Boeing]] company, which established Seattle as a center for its manufacturing of aircraft.

Beginning in the 1980s, the Seattle area developed into a [[list of technology centers|technology center]]; [[Microsoft]] established its headquarters in the region. In 1994, Internet retailer [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]] was founded in Seattle, and [[Alaska Airlines]] is based in [[SeaTac, Washington]], serving [[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]], Seattle's international airport. The stream of new software, [[biotechnology]], and Internet companies led to an economic revival, which increased the city's population by almost 50,000 in the decade between 1990 and 2000.

The culture of Seattle is heavily defined by its [[Music of Seattle|significant musical history]]. Between 1918 and 1951, nearly 24 [[jazz]] nightclubs existed along Jackson Street, from the current [[Chinatown/International District, Seattle|Chinatown/International District]] to the [[Central District, Seattle|Central District]]. The jazz scene nurtured the early careers of [[Ernestine Anderson]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Quincy Jones]], and others. In the late 20th and early 21st century, the city also was the origin of several [[Rock music|rock]] bands, including [[Foo Fighters]], [[Heart (band)|Heart]], and [[Jimi Hendrix]], and the subgenre of [[grunge]] and its pioneering bands, including [[Alice in Chains]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[Soundgarden]], and others.<ref name="Seattle_Sound">{{cite book |last=Heylin |first=Clinton |title=Babylon's Burning: From Punk to Grunge |publisher=Conongate |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-84195-879-8 |page=[https://archive.org/details/babylonsburningf0000heyl/page/606 606] |url=https://archive.org/details/babylonsburningf0000heyl/page/606}}</ref>

The name "Seattle" appears on official [[Washington Territory]] papers dated May 23, 1853, when the first plats for the village were filed. In 1855, nominal land settlements were established. On January 14, 1865, the Legislature of Territorial Washington incorporated the Town of Seattle with a [[trustee model of representation|board of trustees]] managing the city. The Town of Seattle was disincorporated on January 18, 1867, and remained a mere precinct of King County until late 1869, when a new petition was filed and the city was re-incorporated December 2, 1869, with a [[mayor–council government]].<ref name=founding/><ref>{{cite web |author=Greg Lange |author2=Cassandra Tate |date=November 4, 1998 |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=168 |title=Legislature incorporates the Town of Seattle for the first time on January 14, 1865. |publisher=HistoryLink |access-date=October 14, 2007 |archive-date=February 24, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224213817/https://www.historylink.org/File/168 |url-status=live }}</ref> The corporate seal of the City of Seattle carries the date "1869" and a likeness of Chief Seattle in left profile.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/facts/symbols.htm |title=Seattle City Symbols |publisher=City of Seattle |access-date=February 28, 2014 |archive-date=September 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921214904/http://www.seattle.gov/cityarchives/Facts/symbols.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> That same year, Seattle acquired the epithet of the "Queen City", a designation officially changed in 1982 to the "Emerald City".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.historylink.org/File/181" |title=Seattle receives epithet Queen City in 1869 |author=Greg Lange |publisher=HistoryLink |access-date=June 27, 2022}}</ref>

Seattle has a history of boom-and-bust cycles, like many other cities near areas of extensive natural and mineral resources. Seattle has risen several times economically, then gone into precipitous decline, but it has typically used those periods to rebuild solid infrastructure.<ref name=shear>

The first such boom, covering the early years of the city, rode on the lumber industry. During this period the road now known as [[Yesler Way]] won the nickname "Skid Road", supposedly after the timber skidding down the hill to [[Henry Yesler]]'s sawmill. The later dereliction of the area may be a possible origin for the term which later entered the wider American lexicon as ''[[Skid Row]]''.<ref name=yesler>{{cite web |author=Junius Rochester |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=286 |title=Yesler, Henry L. |publisher=HistoryLink |date=October 7, 1998 |access-date=October 1, 2007 |archive-date=February 24, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224212357/https://www.historylink.org/File/286 |url-status=live }}</ref> Like much of the [[Western United States|U.S. West]], Seattle experienced onflicts between labor and management and ethnic tensions that culminated in the [[History of Seattle before 1900#Relations between whites and Chinese|anti-Chinese riots of 1885–1886]].<ref>{{cite book |author=George Kinnear |url=http://en.wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=Anti-Chinese_Riots_At_Seattle |title=Anti-Chinese Riots At Seattle, Wn..

The second and most dramatic boom resulted from the [[Klondike Gold Rush]], which ended the depression that had begun with the [[Panic of 1893]]. In a short time, Seattle became a major transportation center. On July 14, 1897, the ''S.S. Portland'' docked with its famed "ton of gold", and Seattle became the main transport and supply point for the miners in [[Alaska]] and the [[Yukon]]. Few of those working men found lasting wealth. However, it was Seattle's business of clothing the miners and feeding them salmon that panned out in the long run. Along with Seattle, other cities like [[Everett, Washington|Everett]], [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], [[Port Townsend, Washington|Port Townsend]], [[Bremerton, Washington|Bremerton]], and [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], all in the Puget Sound region, became competitors for exchange, rather than [[mother lode]]s for extraction, of precious metals.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=687 |title=Klondike Gold Rush |publisher=HistoryLink.org |date=January 14, 1999 |author=Greg Lange |access-date=October 1, 2007 |archive-date=February 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225161326/https://www.historylink.org/File/687 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The boom lasted into the early part of the 20th century, and funded many new Seattle companies and products. In 1907, 19-year-old [[James E. Casey]] borrowed $100 from a friend and founded the [[American Messenger Company]] (later [[United Parcel Service|UPS]]). Other Seattle companies founded during this period include [[Nordstrom]] and [[Eddie Bauer]].<ref name=Klondike-foundings/> Seattle brought in the [[Olmsted Brothers]] landscape architecture firm to design a system of parks and boulevards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.seattle.gov/parks/parkspaces/olmsted.htm |title=Park History – Olmsted Parks |publisher=Seattle Parks and Recreation |access-date=November 30, 2015 |archive-date=April 14, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210414203312/http://www.seattle.gov/parks/about-us/park-history |url-status=live }}</ref>

A [[shipbuilding]] boom in the early part of the 20th century became massive during [[World War I]], making Seattle somewhat of a company town.

[[Hooverville]] arose during the Depression, leading to Seattle's growing homeless population. Stationed outside Seattle, the Hooverville housed thousands of men but very few children and no women.

A movement of women arose from Seattle during the [[Great Depression]], fueled in part by [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]'s 1933 book ''It's Up to the Women''; women pushed for recognition, not just as housewives, but as the backbone to family. Using newspapers and journals ''Working Woman'' and ''The Woman Today'', women pushed to be seen as equal and receive some recognition.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Orleck |first=Annelise |date=1993 |title=We Are the Mythical Thing Called the Public |journal=Feminist Studies |volume=19 |pages=147–172 |doi=10.2307/3178357 |jstor=3178357|hdl=2027/spo.0499697.0019.109 |hdl-access=free | issn = 0046-3663 }}</ref>

Seattle was the home base of impresario [[Alexander Pantages]] who, starting in 1902, opened a number of theaters in the city exhibiting [[vaudeville]] acts and silent movies.

Seattle is located between the saltwater [[Puget Sound]] (an arm of the Pacific Ocean) to the west and [[Lake Washington]] to the east. The city's chief harbor, [[Elliott Bay]], is part of Puget Sound, making the city an oceanic port. To the west, beyond Puget Sound, are the [[Kitsap Peninsula]] and [[Olympic Mountains]] on the [[Olympic Peninsula]]; to the east, beyond Lake Washington and the [[Eastside (King County, Washington)|Eastside]] suburbs, are [[Lake Sammamish]] and the [[Cascade Range]]. Lake Washington's waters flow to Puget Sound through the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]] (consisting of two man-made canals, [[Lake Union]], and the [[Hiram M. Chittenden Locks]] at [[Salmon Bay]], ending in [[Shilshole Bay]] on Puget Sound).{{citation needed|date=April 2021}}

The sea, rivers, forests, lakes, and fields surrounding Seattle were once rich enough to support one of the world's few sedentary [[hunter-gatherer]] societies.

Thus extreme [[heat wave]]s are rare in the Seattle area, as are very cold temperatures (below about {{convert|15|F|C|disp=semicolon}}).

The [[Seattle Street Railway|first streetcars]] appeared in 1889 and were instrumental in the creation of a relatively well-defined downtown and strong neighborhoods at the end of their lines. The advent of the automobile began the dismantling of rail in Seattle. Tacoma–Seattle railway service ended in 1929 and the Everett–Seattle service came to an end in 1939, replaced by automobiles running on the recently developed highway system. Rails on city streets were paved over or removed, and the opening of the [[Trolleybuses in Seattle|Seattle trolleybus system]] brought the end of [[Seattle Street Railway|streetcars in Seattle]] in 1941. This left an extensive network of privately owned buses (later public) as the only mass transit within the city and throughout the region.<ref name="interurbanrail">{{cite news |url=http://www.historylink.org/essays/output.cfm?file_id=2667 |title=Interurban Rail Transit in King County and the Puget Sound Region – A Snapshot History |date=September 19, 2000 |publisher=HistoryLink.org |author=Walt Crowley|access-date=September 29, 2007}}</ref>
