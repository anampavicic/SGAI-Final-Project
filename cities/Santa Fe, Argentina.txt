'''Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz''' ({{IPA|es|ˈsanta ˈfe ðe la ˈβeɾa ˈkɾus}}; usually called just '''Santa Fe''', lit. "Holy Faith") is the capital city of the [[provinces of Argentina|province]] of [[Santa Fe Province|Santa Fe]], [[Argentina]].  It is situated in north-eastern Argentina, near the junction of the [[Paraná River|Paraná]] and [[Salado River, Argentina|Salado]] rivers.  It lies {{convert|15|km}} from the [[Hernandarias Subfluvial Tunnel]] that connects it to the city of [[Paraná, Argentina|Paraná]]. The city is also connected by [[canal]] with the [[port]] of Colastiné on the Paraná River.  Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz has about 391,164 inhabitants per the {{census-ar|2010}}. The [[metropolitan area]] has a population of 653,073, making it the eighth largest in Argentina.

Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz is linked to [[Rosario]] ({{convert|170|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} to the south), the largest city in the province, by the [[Brigadier Estanislao López Highway]] and by [[National Route 11 (Argentina)|National Route 11]], which continues south towards [[Buenos Aires]]. [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]] is about ({{convert|340|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of Santa Fe,  through the [[:es:Ruta Nacional 19 (Argentina)|National Route 19]]. Santa Fe is home to the [[Sauce Viejo Airport]] with daily direct flights to [[Rosario]] and [[Aeroparque Jorge Newbery]] in Buenos Aires.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2011}}
Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz was founded on the nearby site of [[Cayastá]] in 1573 by the [[conquistador]] [[Juan de Garay]] (1528-1583)<ref>
[https://books.google.com/books?id=j7v0DwAAQBAJ ''The South American Republics''], page 22 - "[...] it was not until 1573 that the Spaniards from Asuncion succeeded in founding a city south of the confluence of the Paraná and Paraguay. Santa Fé was the first Spanish settlement on the Plate in territory now a part of the Argentine Republic. [...]  The man who led the creoles to the pampa was Juan de Garay, a Basque, who had been one of the soldiers in the army that conquered Peru."
</ref>
during an expedition which he led from [[Asunción]] (in present-day [[Paraguay]]) to the [[Paraná River]]. (Cayastá today has a historical park containing the grave of [[Hernando Arias de Saavedra|Hernandarias]] (1561-1634), the first American-born governor in South America.)  The settlement was moved to the present site in 1653 due to the constant flooding of the Cayastá River. The city of Santa Fe became the provincial capital in 1814, when the territory of the province of Santa Fe was separated from the province of [[Buenos Aires Province|Buenos Aires]] by the [[Argentine Constitution|National Constituent Assembly]], held in the city in 1853.

Santa Fe de la Vera Cruz became the commercial and transportation center for a rich agricultural area that produces grain, [[vegetable oil]]s, and meats. The city is the site of the [[National Technological University – Santa Fe Regional Faculty]], [[Catholic University of Santa Fe]] (inaugurated in 1959), and the [[National University of the Littoral]] (first founded as the Provincial University in 1889, it adopted its current name in 1919).

A [[suspension bridge]] was completed in 1924, though severe flooding partially destroyed it in 1983 (a second bridge, the Oroño, was opened in 1971). The city's location is still not immune to flooding. On  April 29, 2003, the Salado, which empties into the [[Paraná River|Paraná]] near Santa Fe, rose almost 2&nbsp;m (6.5&nbsp;ft) in a few hours following heavy rainfall, and caused a catastrophic flood. No fewer than 100,000 people had to be evacuated, and large sections of the city remained under water more than a week later. That year, the suspension bridge was reopened, and in 2008, the city's historic grain silos were converted into the [[Los Silos Hotel and Casino]], and San Martín Street was converted to pedestrian use.

The city's historical role in the Argentine Constitution led national lawmakers to choose it as the site of Constitutional Conventions in [[Argentine legislative election, 1948|1949]], [[Argentine Constitutional Assembly election, 1957|1957]], and [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|1994]].

== Climate ==
The city has a climate considered as [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]] (''Cfa'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]], with a ''Cwa'' tendency). Winters are generally mild, though minimum temperatures can fall below {{convert|0|C|1}} on cold nights during the winter. Summers are generally hot and humid. During the most extreme [[heat waves]], temperatures have exceeded {{convert|45|C|1}}. Temperatures have exceeded {{convert|35|C|1}} in every season.<ref name = SMN>{{cite web

Rainfall can be expected throughout the year though summer is usually the wettest season. [[Thunderstorms]] can be intense with frequent [[lightning]], powerful downdraughts and intense [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]. The lowest record temperature was {{convert|-7.0|C|1}} on June 13, 1967, while the highest recorded temperature was {{convert|45.6|C|1}} on January 25, 1986.<ref name=SMNextremes />

==Transport==

===Railway===
Despite having had four [[railway station]]s, nowadays the city Santa Fe is not served by rail transport. The [[Santa Fe (Mitre) railway station|Mitre Railway station]] is no longer used since 2007, when defunct company [[Trenes de Buenos Aires]] cancelled its services to Santa Fe. Likewise, the [[Santa Fe (Belgrano) railway station|Santa Fe Belgrano]] (built in 1891 and named Cultural Heritage) and Guadalupe stations had been entered into disuse in 1993 when the [[railway privatisation in Argentina]] ceased all the long-distance services in the country.

In the 2010s, the local municipality remodelled both stations as Guadalupe would be terminus for a new urban train.<ref>[http://www.infrapublica.com/index.php/noticias/item/1400-acondicionan-la-estacion-guadalupe-en-santa-fe-con-vistas-al-proyecto-de-tren-urbano "Acondicionan la Estación Guadalupe, en Santa Fe, con vistas al proyecto de tren urbano"], El Litoral, 2010</ref><ref name=puestavalor/> Nevertheless, the original project was not carried out. On the other hand, the Santa Fe Belgrano station was re-opened as a [[convention center]].<ref>[http://www.santafeciudad.gov.ar/ciudad/espacios_emblematicos/estacion_belgrano.html "Estación Belgrano"] on Government of Santa Fe website</ref>

The fourth station (also the oldest of all) had been built by [[France|French]] company [[Province of Santa Fe Railway]] in 1885. It was demolished in 1962 and replaced by a [[bus station]].<ref>[http://www.paraconocernos.com.ar/?p=478 "Ferrocarril en Santa Fe"]</ref>

Railway stations in the city of Santa Fe are:

==Sports==
Santa Fe put itself on the international sports map as one of the host cities of the [[1990 FIBA World Championship]].<ref>[https://archive.fiba.com/pages/eng/fa/event/p/sid/2912/_/index.html 1990 World Championship for Men], Archive.FIBA.com, Retrieved 18 March 2016.</ref> The games were played in the [[Estadio de la Facultad Regional Santa Fe]]. The [[Estadio Ángel Malvicino]] was one of the venues of the [[2002 FIVB Men's Volleyball World Championship]]. Santa Fe also hosted the first ever [[Five-pin billiards#World Five-pins Championship|Five-pin billiards World Championship]] in 1965.

The city is also home to two [[Primera División Argentina|first division]] [[Association football|football]] teams: [[Club Atlético Colón]] and [[Unión de Santa Fe|Club Atlético Unión]], who contest the [[Santa Fe derby]]. Santa Fe was also the place where the world known [[:es:Amílcar Brusa|Amílcar Brusa]] was born and raised, and the home of boxers [[Carlos Baldomir]] and [[Julio César Vásquez]].
