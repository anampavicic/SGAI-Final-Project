'''Bayambang''', officially the '''Municipality of Bayambang''' ({{langx|pag|Baley na Bayambang}}; {{langx|ilo|Ili ti Bayambang}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Bayambang}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Pangasinan]], [[Philippines]].  According to the 2020 census it has a population of 129,011.{{PH census|current}}

It previously included the municipalities of [[Bautista, Pangasinan|Bautista]], [[Alcala, Pangasinan|Alcala]], [[Santo Tomas, Pangasinan|Santo Tomas]], [[Rosales, Pangasinan|Rosales]], [[Paniqui]], [[Gerona, Tarlac|Gerona]] and [[Camiling]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pangasinan.gov.ph/the-province/cities-and-municipalities/bayambang/ |title=Bayambang |access-date=December 18, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160811092607/http://pangasinan.gov.ph/the-province/cities-and-municipalities/bayambang/ |archive-date=August 11, 2016 }}</ref> It was founded in the 16th century by Agalet, an [[Aeta people|Aeta]].

Bayambang is the former seat of the 5th Capital of the Revolutionary Philippine Republic. It celebrates its Malangsi Fishtival (1st week of April, "Kalutan tan Gayaga ed Dalan"). Bayambang is the seat of the [[Pangasinan State University]] and the Colleges of Nursing and Education.

== Etymology ==
The name of this town according to the legend, came from the name of a plant called "balangbang" (''[[Bauhinia acuminata]]'') which grew in abundance during the early days. "Culibangbang" leaves were used for bulalong Iloko or sinigang. The verdant hills of Bayambang were almost covered by these plants. The people made pickles out of them. As the years passed by these plants became extinct in the vicinity but the name "Bayambang", which sounds like an echo of the plant's name, was retained as the town designation.

Others believed that the name of the town came from the once numerous "Culibangbang" trees which were misunderstood as "Bayambang" by Spanish colonizers.<ref name="bayambang.gov.ph">{{cite web |url=http://www.bayambang.gov.ph/about/ |title=About Bayambang &#124; Municipality of Bayambang |website=www.bayambang.gov.ph |access-date=June 6, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209160328/http://www.bayambang.gov.ph/about/ |archive-date=February 9, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Telbang (''[[Erythrina variegata]]''), also known as Bagbag in Ilokano and Dapdap in other dialects, was the original Bayambang. Bayambang is not a tree but actually a plant named [[Celosia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sferrer.blogspot.com/2012_03_01_archive.html |title=Holy Family Parish |access-date=December 18, 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304203840/http://sferrer.blogspot.com/2012_03_01_archive.html |archive-date=March 4, 2016 }}</ref>

== History ==
Benaldo Gutierrez and Honorato Carungay claim Bayambang was founded in the early 16th century by an [[Aeta]] named Agalet. Bayambang was inside Inirangan and Hermosa but was re-located to Telbang and southern Poblacion in Old Bayambang.

In 1897, the first "Juez de Cuchillo" executed residents and burned houses. In November 1899 [[Emilio Aguinaldo]] designated Bayambang as the Pangasinan capital during the Japanese Regime and the seat of the short-lived Philippine Republic.  It was captured by Gen. [[Arthur MacArthur Jr.|Arthur MacArthur]] of Tarlac on October 12, 1899. [[Jose P. Rizal]] visited [[Camiling]], [[Tarlac]]'s Leonor Rivera, since it was formerly a part of Bayambang. [[Antonio Luna]] built a camp in Bayambang. Dr. Diaz became Governor under the Japanese Imperial Government and held Office in Bayambang at the Eulogio Dauz residence (junction of Quezon Blvd. And M.H. Del Pilar streets).{{clarify inline|reason=What Japanese Regime? Who was Dr. Diaz? needs clarification and support.|date=September 2024}}

Bayambang was the seat of the [[UNESCO]] National Community Training Center. [[Gobernadorcillo]] Vicente Cayabyab was the first Chief Executive of the town during the Spanish Regime followed by [[Cabeza de Barangay]] Mauricio de Guzman. He was succeeded by Honorato Carungay Lorenzo Rodriguez, Julian Mananzan and later Saturnino Evaristo Dimalanta as president.

Lauriano Roldan became the first Civil Government President. He was succeeded by Alvino Garcia, Mateo Mananzan, Gavino de Guzman, Marciano Fajardo, Agustin Carungay, Emeterio Camacho and Enrique M. Roldan.

The Mayors were Gerundio Umengan, Leopoldo Aquino Sr., Ambrosio Gloria (appointed by the PCAU of the Army), Bernardo Lagoy, Leopoldo Aquino Sr. (reelected), Eligio C. Sagun (1952–1955), Don Numeriano Castro (appointed), Salvador F. Quinto (1956–1959), Miguel C. Matabang (1960–1963), Jaime P. Junio (1964–1986), Feliciano Casingal Jr. (OIC), Don Daniel Bato (OIC), Domingo Tagulao, Calixto B. Camacho, Leocadio C. De Vera Jr and Engr. Ricardo M. Camacho.

Binasuan is a colorful and lively dance from Bayambang which illustrates the balancing skills of the dancers.  The dancers gracefully maneuver glasses half-filled with rice wine which whirl and roll on the floor.

Fish "Buro" is originally made in barangay Bongato. This fermented rice delicacy is made of [[steamed rice]], salt and freshwater fish (either carp, catfish, eel, gurami or "dalag"). Rice Crackers are made in barangay Sangcagulis and has become a popular merienda among the locals.
