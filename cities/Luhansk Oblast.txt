'''Luhansk Oblast''' ({{langx|uk|Луганська область|translit=Luhanska oblast}}; {{langx|ru|Луганская область|Luganskaya oblast}}), also referred to as '''Luhanshchyna''' ({{langx|uk|Луганщина|label=none}}), is the easternmost [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|oblast]] (province) of [[Ukraine]]. Its administrative center is the city of [[Luhansk]]. The oblast was established in 1938 and bore the name ''Voroshilovgrad Oblast'' until 1958 and again from 1970 to 1991.<ref>[http://zakon4.rada.gov.ua/aws/show/1213а-12 Про внесення змін і доповнень до Конституції (Основного Закону) Української РСР | від 19.06.1991 № 1213а-XII]{{Dead link|date=March 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It has a population of {{Ua-pop-est2022|2,102,921|.}}

All of the oblast is in the [[Donbas]] region. 

In 2014, large parts of the oblast, including the capital Luhansk, came under the control of Russian-backed separatists who declared the [[Luhansk People's Republic]], leading to a [[War in Donbas (2014–2022)|war against Ukrainian government forces]]. Since the 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], the oblast has come almost entirely under Russian occupation and has been the scene of [[Luhansk Oblast campaign|heavy fighting]], which continues in some places. In late September 2022, Russia declared the [[Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts|annexation of the entire oblast, along with three others]], though the annexation remains internationally unrecognized.

==Geography==
[[File:Lugansk province physical map.svg|thumb|left|upright|A topographic map of the oblast]]

Luhansk Oblast is in far [[eastern Ukraine]]. Its north–south length is 250&nbsp;km, and east–west width 190&nbsp;km. It covers an area of 26,700&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, 4.42% of the total area of Ukraine.

The oblast has the longest segment of Ukraine's international border with Russia among other regions (''see [[State Border of Ukraine]]''), consisting of {{convert |746|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The abutting Russian oblasts are [[Belgorod Oblast]] to the north, [[Voronezh Oblast]] to the northeast, [[Rostov Oblast]] to the east. Abutting Ukrainian oblasts are [[Kharkiv Oblast]] to the west, and [[Donetsk Oblast]] to the south.

The region is located in the valley of the [[Donets|Siversky Donets]] river, which flows west to east through the oblast and splits it approximately in half. The southern portion of the region is elevated by the Donetsk Ridge, which is close to the southern border. The highest point is [[Mohyla Mechetna]] ({{convert|367|m|ft|abbr=on}}), the highest point of Donetsk Ridge. The left bank of the Siversky Donets is part of the Starobilsk Plain. To the north this transforms into the [[Central Russian Upland]].

==History==
{{recentism|date=January 2023}}
The territory was formerly part of the [[Wild Fields]], and former administrative units in the territory of the current oblast included [[Sloboda Ukraine]], [[Slavo-Serbia]], [[Yekaterinoslav Governorate]], [[Donets Governorate]] and [[Donetsk Oblast]].

=== Soviet Ukraine (1938–1991) ===
{{See also|Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic}}[[File:Don Cossacks monument Luhansk.JPG|thumb|A monument to [[Don Cossacks]] in Luhansk. "To the sons of glory and freedom", 2012]]

The oblast originated in 1938 as Voroshylovhrad (Russian: Voroshilovgrad) Oblast ({{Langx|uk|Ворошиловградська область|translit=Voroshylovhradska oblast}}) after the Donetsk Oblast was split between Voroshylovhrad and Stalino (today [[Donetsk Oblast]]) oblasts. Following the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], [[Starobilsk]] was the location of a prisoner of war camp for Poles, who were then massacred in the [[Katyn massacre]] in 1940. After the invasion by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1941, the region came under a German military administration, due to its proximity to frontlines. It was occupied at the end of 1942 as part of [[Case Blue]] German offensive directed towards [[Volgograd|Stalingrad]].

Soon after the [[battle of Stalingrad]], the Luhansk (at that time Voroshilovgrad in honor of [[Kliment Voroshilov]]) region again became the center of military operations during the Soviet counter-offensive [[operation Little Saturn]] in the spring of 1943. In the summer of 1943, the region was liberated from the Nazi Germany Armed Forces. During the Soviet era, the Oblast bore its current name between 1958 and 1970.

In the December [[1991 Ukrainian independence referendum|1991 referendum]], 83.86% of votes in the oblast were in favor of the [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine]].

=== Independent Ukraine (1991–2014) ===

==== Pro-Russian insurgency (2014–2022) ====
{{See also|Russian-occupied territories of Ukraine}}
On 8 April 2014, following the [[Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation|annexation of Crimea by Russia]], pro-Russian separatists occupying the Luhansk Oblast administrative building planned to declare the independence of the region as the Luhansk Parliamentary Republic,{{Clarify|reason=It's unclear whether this "Luhansk Parliamentary Republic" was a theoretical project ("planned") or instead briefly existed before being abolished.|date=July 2022}} after other pro-Russian separatists declared [[Donetsk People's Republic]] in the Donetsk Oblast (7 April 2014). When the Luhansk Parliamentary Republic ceased to exist, the separatists declared the [[Luhansk People's Republic]] on 27 April 2014. They held a [[2014 Donbas status referendums|disputed referendum]] on separating from Ukraine on 11 May 2014. The legitimacy of the referendums was not recognized by any government.<ref name="Referendum on joining Russia">{{cite web|title= Ukraine's Eastern Region Of Luhansk May Now Hold Referendum On Joining Russia |url= http://www.businessinsider.com/ukraines-luhansk-may-now-hold-referendum-on-joining-russia-2014-5|work=Business Insider|access-date=12 May 2014}}</ref> Ukraine does not recognize the referendum, while the EU and US said the polls were illegal and fraudulent.<ref>BBC News 12 May 2014</ref> Subsequently, the [[War in Donbas (2014–2022)|war in Donbas]] began.

As a result of the war in Donbas, Luhansk insurgents control the southern third of the oblast, which includes the city of [[Luhansk]], the region's most populous city and the capital of the oblast. Due to this, most oblast government functions have moved to [[Sievierodonetsk]], which forces of the Government of Ukraine recaptured in July 2014. Many universities located in the occupied areas have moved to government-controlled cities such as Sievierodonetsk, [[Starobilsk]] or [[Rubizhne]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/31372.html |title=In Severodonetsk, Petro Poroshenko presented Luhansk RSA Head Hennadiy Moskal – Official web-site of President of Ukraine |access-date=21 January 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318021609/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/31372.html |archive-date=18 March 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.luganskukraine.info/lugansk-university.aspx|title=Lugansk University.

During the 2022 [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Russian ground forces entered the occupied territory of Luhansk Oblast by crossing the Russian border on 22 February 2022. They invaded government-controlled territory across the line of contact and the Russian border on 24 February.

During the mid-2022 [[Battle of Donbas (2022)|battle of Donbas]], Russian troops attacked and eventually captured the cities of [[Sievierodonetsk|Sieverodonetsk]] and [[Lysychansk]] during May and June 2022 in two of the most significant and most intense battles of the [[Eastern Ukraine offensive]].

Like the other provinces of Ukraine, Luhansk Oblast has a double jurisdiction. The oblast is predominantly administrated by the Luhansk Oblast State Administration, headed by the [[Chief of local state administration|governor of the oblast]], who is appointed by the [[President of Ukraine]]. The province has a representative body, the provincial council, which is headed by its chairman and elected by popular vote.

The province is primarily divided into 18 ''[[raion]]s'' (districts), and 37 cities, including 14 [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|cities of regional significance]]. The administrative center is [[Luhansk]]. These raions are listed below with their areas and populations.<ref>State Statistics Committee of Ukraine, Kyiv.</ref>

The province's secondary division consists of various municipalities. Those municipalities may consist of one or more populated places. The municipalities are administratively subordinate to the raion in which they are located, with the exception of 14 cities subordinated directly to the oblast. The city of Luhansk is subdivided into its own four city-districts (boroughs).

All subdivisions are governed by their respective councils (''radas'').
