The northern part of the Fergana region is occupied by the Karakalpak and Yazyavan steppes, and is bounded on the south by a tributary of the Olay ridge. Fergana region is a high seismic zone. The climate is continental, and the winters are mild, sometimes very cold. The average temperature in January is 3.2 C, in July - 28 C. The lowest temperature is 27.9 C. The maximum temperature is 42 C. Strong "Kokand wind" blowing in the west of the valley has a negative impact on the climate. In the south-east it blows summer wind. Annual precipitation ranges from 100&nbsp;mm in the west (around Kokand) to 170&nbsp;mm in the east, and up to 270&nbsp;mm on the mountain slopes, mainly in the spring. Vegetation period is 210–240 days. The Syrdarya River flows along the north-western border of the region. Isfara, Sokh, Shohimardon, Isfayramsay start from the Alay ridge. The rivers are saturated with ice and snow. There are mainly gray soils and meadow-swamp soils, mostly hungry and typical gray soils on the hills, alluvial-meadow soils on the terraces of the Syrdarya, sandy and loamy meadows in the northern part of the region.

Various salt marshes grow in the salt marshes of Central Fergana. There are poplar, mulberry, slate, broad-leaved forests, and pine forests in the oases in the river valleys. In the Syrdarya tugai forests, wolves, foxes, wolverines, rabbits, badgers, and jays are among the wild animals. There are many birds and reptiles. In the water basins, there are fish such as marinka, usach, carp, grass carp, perch.

==History==
[[File:Two snakes, Sokh, Ferghana valley, 3rd millennium BCE (front).jpg|thumb|Two snakes, [[Soʻx District|Sokh]], Ferghana valley, 3rd millennium BCE.<ref>{{cite web |title=Splendeurs des oasis dOuzbekistan, p.12 |url=https://api-www.louvre.fr/sites/default/files/2022-11/DP-LOUVRE_Exposition-Splendeurs-des-oasis-dOuzbekistan.2022.pdf}}</ref>]]
Fergana region is one of the centers of ancient culture of Uzbekistan. Pictures of Stone Age settlements and rocks found in the area, stone tools indicate that people have lived in the valley since ancient times. The excavation of the Greater Fergana Canal has played an important role in the study of archeological monuments of the region. During the canal's excavation, monuments of the Bronze Age, slavery and landownership were found and examined. Finds from the 5th century BC and early Middle Ages in the city of Kuva are well researched. Historical sources from the 10th to the 11th centuries state that this city was the largest city in the valley after Akhsikat in terms of prosperity and size. Archaeological materials prove that the city of Margilan was a large village in the 10th century and took on the appearance of a village in the 11th-12th centuries.

The monuments found in the settlements of the Chust culture, which were engaged in sedentary farming and animal husbandry, are important in the study of the Fergana Valley. Archaeological excavations show that Fergana region has long been inhabited by people, engaged in hunting, farming, animal husbandry, and in the later stages of human society, culture began to develop.

Fergana, which fascinates everyone with its charming nature and unique beauty, has a long history. The reasons for naming this mysterious place "Fergana" are variously described in historical sources.

Scholars have noted that the word "Fergana" was written in the early Middle Ages in the Sogdian script in the forms "Pargana", "Pragana" and in Indo-Sanskrit "small region"; in Persian it means "valley between mountains", "closed valley". It was called "Dovon" in the 2nd century BC, and in the early Middle Ages it was called "Bohan", "Bohanna".

The history of Fergana dates back to the III-II millennium BC. From ancient times the inhabitants of this land have been in close cultural contact with other peoples of the Far East, South and Central Asia. Examples of this are the relics of the "Andronov culture" (III-II millennium BC), which are very common in the region, or the amulet "Two-headed snake" found in Sokh district. The war, labor weapons, household items, and other items of these periods differ from those found in other parts of Central Asia.

With the opening of the Great Silk Road, the influence of Chinese culture on the lives of the peoples of Fergana began to be felt. The emergence of bronze windows, coins, silk fabrics, iron weapons, etc. is directly related to the Great Silk Road. It is precisely because of the Great Silk Road that in the beginning of our era, information about the breeding of horses, camels and small animals, the abundance of precious metals, as well as the cultivation of cotton, grapes and cereals spread around the world. The large number of city-fortress settlements of this period testifies to the development of architecture and urban planning technology.

In the early Middle Ages, Fergana became one of the bridges between Central Asia and China, and the socio-political environment here also changed frequently under the influence of these two regions.

During the reign of the Timurids, national handicrafts, like other industries, developed further. For example, Margilan specialized in the production of silk and silk products, Rishtan in ceramics.

In the beginning of the 18th century, representatives of the Ming dynasty united the villages around the city of Kokand and established a new khanate. Shortly afterward, the Kokand Khanate became one of Central Asia's largest, most powerful, and fastest-growing states.

Fergana, which underwent various turbulent years during the dictatorial regime, finally discovered true beauty during the period of independence and entered a new stage of development. In the words of the first President, he received the status of "Fergana - the pearl of Central Asia."
ilt.

The decree of the First President of the Republic of Uzbekistan dated July 1, 2010 "On the formation of the General Plan of the city of Fergana until 2020" excited all residents of Fergana. Magnificent buildings, trade and service facilities, 5 parks and alleys, 8 fountains, bridges and public roads, built in a combination of national and modern art, have been completed.

==Literature==

From the 18th century onwards, science, literature, and art flourished in the Fergana Valley, particularly in Kokand. The formation of the Kokand khanate and its functioning as a centralized state allowed the formation of a unique literary environment in the territory of the khanate. During this period, such literary figures as Huvaydo, Shokhi, Akmal, Nizami, Hoqandi created.

In the 19th century, the literature known as the "Kokand Literary Environment" flourished in the region. The organizer of this environment, Kokand khan Muhammad Said Amir Umarkhan (1787-1822) attracted about 100 artists to the palace and created material and spiritual conditions for their creativity. The khan himself wrote the "Devoni" of poems under the pseudonym Amir.

It is known from history that Fergana was the birthplace of great scholars, like Ahmad Fergani, Burhaniddin Marginoni, poets such as Muqimi, Furkat, Nodira, Uvaysi, and a number of scientists. During the years of independence, the rich spiritual heritage left by these authors has been completely rediscovered, boosting spiritual and cultural life.

Fergana literature, which is an integral part of Uzbek literature, flourished, especially during the years of independence. People's poets of Uzbekistan such as Ohunjon Hakimov, Anvar Obidjon, Ikbol Mirzo, Enakhon Siddikova, M. Ergasheva, Yuldosh Solijonov, Khudoiberdi Tukhtaboev, I. Mahmud, Bahodir Isa, Siddik Momin are constantly shaking the pen and creating images of our contemporaries in their works.
