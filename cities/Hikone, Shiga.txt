[[File:Hikone castle17s3200.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[Hikone Castle]]]]
Hikone is part of ancient  [[Ōmi Province]] and was originally a market town that developed around a Buddhist temple called Hogon-ji which was founded in the [[Heian period]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers|year=1996|isbn=1-884964-04-4|editor-last=Schellinger|editor-first=Paul|location=Chicago|pages=338, 339|editor-last2=Salkin|editor-first2=Robert}}</ref> The site was a natural bottleneck on the route of the [[Tōsandō]] (later the [[Nakasendō]]) highway connecting [[Heian-kyō]] with the eastern provinces. Hikone is  home to two former [[shukuba|post stations]], [[Toriimoto-juku]] and [[Takamiya-juku]] on the Nakasendō and the [[Chōsenjin Kaidō]] also passed through the area. Strategically, it was a vital point in protecting the capital from attack from the east. In the [[Sengoku period]], this area was controlled by the [[Azai clan]], who were based in northern Ōmi, and who built a castle called Sawayama Castle. The Azai were defeated by [[Oda Nobunaga]], who assigned Sawayama Castle to his general [[Niwa Nagahide]]. Under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], this closest advisor, [[Ishida Mitsunari]] was entrusted with the castle. After Ishida Mitsunari was defeated at the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1601, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] appointed his general [[Ii Naomasa]] as ''[[daimyō]]'' of a new domain centered at Sawayama Castle. Ii Naomasa began the construction of [[Hikone Castle]], which was completed by his son [[Ii Naokatsu]] in 1622. The area remained under the control of [[Hikone Domain]] through the end of the [[Edo Period]].<ref name="Shiseki">{{cite book |last1=Isomura |first1=Yukio |last2=Sakai |first2=Hideya |title=(国指定史跡事典) National Historic Site Encyclopedia |date=2012 |publisher=学生社 |isbn=4311750404}}{{in lang|ja}}</ref>

The town of Hikone was established on April 1, 1889 within [[Inukami District, Shiga]] with the creation of the modern municipalities system. It was raised to city status on February 11, 1937 by merging with the neighboring villages of Matsubara, Aonami, Kitaaoyagi, Fukumitsu and Chimoto. The city escaped major damage in [[World War II]].

In 2003, meetings were held to discuss the merger of Hikone with the towns of [[Toyosato, Shiga|Toyosato]], [[Kōra, Shiga|Kōra]], and [[Taga, Shiga|Taga]] (all from [[Inukami District, Shiga|Inukami District]]). However, a survey conducted by the city in February 2004, revealed that most citizens opposed the merger, leading the city government to shelve the proposal.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}}

==Government==
[[file:Hikone City Hall.jpg|right|thumb|Hikone City Hall]]
Hikone has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 24 members. Hikone, collectively with the towns of Inukami District, contributes four members to the Shiga Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Shiga 2nd district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
[[File:Hikone Apples 07.jpg|thumb|Hikone apples, a local [[apple]] cultivar]]
The key industries of Hikone are the manufacturing of [[butsudan]], [[textile]]s, and [[valve]]s. [[Bridgestone]] has a tire manufacturing plant here. [[Fujitec]], [[Ohmi Railway]], and Heiwadō (the largest supermarket chain in Shiga) are headquartered in Hikone.<ref name=":0" />

In 1999, a small area south of the castle, called the Yume Kyōbashi Castle Road, was built in the old style and attracts visitors keen to see modern construction fused with traditional looks. Even the [[Kansai Urban Bank]] in this district has remodeled itself to fit in with the surrounding structures.

==Education==
[[File:ShigaUniv Hikone AssemblyHall01.jpg|thumb|Shiga University]]
There are three universities in Hikone: [[Seisen University (Shiga)|Seisen University]], [[Shiga University]], and [[The University of Shiga Prefecture]] (USP).

Hikone is also the home of the [[Japan Center for Michigan Universities]] (JCMU), a facility operated jointly by a consortium of the [[List of colleges and universities in Michigan|fifteen public universities]] in the [[Michigan|State of Michigan]] and the government of Shiga Prefecture (in coordination with USP) that offers programs for American university students and scholars for the study of [[Japanese language]] and [[Culture of Japan|culture]], as well as courses in English for the citizens of Shiga Prefecture. The Michigan Center, as it is known, was founded in 1989, under the auspices of the Michigan-Shiga Sister State Agreement, the oldest such relationship between a US state and Japanese prefectures.

Hikone has 17 public elementary schools and seven public middle schools operated by the city government and one middle school operated by the Shiga Prefectural Department of Education. The prefecture also operates six public high schools and two special education schools for the handicapped. There are also two private high schools.
