Sichuan's capital city is [[Chengdu]]; its population stands at 83 million. Sichuan neighbors [[Qinghai]] to the northwest, [[Gansu]] to the north, [[Shaanxi]] to the northeast, [[Chongqing]] (historically part of Sichuan) to the east, [[Guizhou]] to the southeast, [[Yunnan]] to the south, and [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]] to the west.

In antiquity, Sichuan was home to the kingdoms of [[Ancient Chinese states|ancient state]] of [[Ba (state)|Ba]] and [[Shu (kingdom)|Shu]] until their incorporation by the [[Qin (state)|Qin]]. During the [[Three Kingdoms]] era, [[Liu Bei]]'s state of [[Shu Han|Shu]] was based in Sichuan. The area was devastated in the 17th century by [[Zhang Xianzhong]]'s rebellion and the area's subsequent [[Qing dynasty|Manchu]] conquest, but recovered to become one of China's most productive areas by the 19th century. During [[World War II]], [[Chongqing]] served as the temporary capital of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]], and was thus [[Bombing of Chongqing|heavily bombed]]. It was one of the last [[Mainland China|mainland]] areas captured by the [[People's Liberation Army]] during the [[Chinese Civil War]], and was divided into four parts from 1949 to 1952, with Chongqing restored two years later. It suffered gravely during the [[Great Chinese Famine]] of 1959–61 but remained China's [[List of Chinese provinces|most populous province]] until [[Chongqing Municipality]] was again separated from it in 1997.

The [[Han Chinese]] [[Sichuanese people|people]] of Sichuan speak distinctive [[Sichuanese dialects]] of [[Mandarin Chinese]]. The spicy [[Sichuan pepper]] is prominent in modern [[Sichuan cuisine]], featuring dishes—including [[Kung Pao chicken]] and [[mapo tofu]]—that have become staples of Chinese cuisine around the world.

Sichuan is the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|6th-largest provincial economy]] of China, the largest in [[Western China]] and the second largest among inland provinces after [[Henan]]. As of 2021, its nominal GDP was 5,385 billion yuan (US$847.68 billion), ahead of the GDP of Turkey of 815 billion.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=2022-02-07 |title=Decoding China's 2021 GDP Growth Rate: A Look at Regional Numbers |url=https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-2021-gdp-performance-a-look-at-major-provinces-and-cities/ |access-date=2022-09-15 |website=China Briefing News |language=en |archive-date=19 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220819091517/https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-2021-gdp-performance-a-look-at-major-provinces-and-cities/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=GDP (current US$) - Turkiye {{!}} Data |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=TR&year_high_desc=true |access-date=2022-09-15 |website=data.worldbank.org |archive-date=15 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220915041741/https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?locations=TR&year_high_desc=true |url-status=live }}</ref> Compared to a country, it would be the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|18th-largest economy]] as well as the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|19th most populous]] as of 2021.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=GDP (current US$) {{!}} Data |url=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?year_high_desc=true |access-date=2022-09-15 |website=data.worldbank.org |archive-date=15 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220915071456/https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD?year_high_desc=true |url-status=live }}</ref>

=={{anchor|Etymology|Names}} Names==
It is commonly believed that the name ''Sichuan'' means "four [[rivers of China|rivers]]"; in [[folk etymology]], this is usually taken to mean four of the province's major rivers: the [[Jialing River|Jialing]], [[Jinsha River|Jinsha]] (or [[Wu River (Yangtze tributary)|Wu]]), [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min]], and [[Tuo River|Tuo]].<ref name=ruf>{{citation |last=Ruf |first=Gregory Anthony |title=Pillars of the State: Laboring Families, Authority, and Community in Rural Sichuan, 1937–1991 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |date=1994 |page=68}}</ref><ref name=rowan>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JXYgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 |title=Ancient Central China: Centers and Peripheries along the Yangzi River |first1=Rowan K. |last1=Flad |first2=Pochan |last2=Chen |page=26 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=21 January 2013 |isbn=978-0-521-89900-0 |access-date=15 January 2019 |archive-date=18 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210118183450/https://books.google.com/books?id=JXYgAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA26 |url-status=live }}</ref> According to [[Historical geography|historical geographer]] [[Tan Qixiang]], "four rivers" is an erroneous interpretation of the place's name.<ref name="谭其骧">{{cite journal |author1=谭其骧 |author2=王天良 |author3=邹逸麟 |author4=郑宝恒 |author5=胡菊兴 |date=1980 |script-title=zh:我国省区名称的来源 |trans-title=Etymology of our country's provinces |script-journal=zh:《复旦学报(社会科学版)》 |issue=S1 |page=128 |author1-link=Tan Qixiang}}</ref> The name of the province is a contraction of the phrases ''Sì Chuānlù'' {{nowrap|({{linktext|lang=zh|四|川|路}},}} "Four Plain [[Circuit (administrative subdivision)|Circuits]]") and ''Chuānxiá Sìlù'' ({{lang|zh|川峽四路}}, "Four Circuits of Chuanxia"),<ref group="note">''Si'' (四) means "four", ''Chuan'' (川) means "plain", and ''Xia'' ("峽") could be understood as "gorge".

==History==

===Prehistory===
The [[Sichuan Basin]] and adjacent areas of the [[Yangtze]] watershed were a cradle of indigenous civilizations dating back to at least the 15th century&nbsp;BC, coinciding with the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] in northern China. The region had its own distinct religious beliefs and worldview. The earliest excavated culture found therein is the [[Baodun culture]] ({{circa}}2700–1750 BC) excavated in the [[Chengdu Plain]].<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I3XG3H_WlM8C&pg=PT164 |title=A Companion to Chinese Archaeology |editor=Anne P.

The most important native states were those of Ba and Shu.

The rulers of the expansionist state of [[Qin (state)|Qin]], based in present-day [[Gansu]] and [[Shaanxi]], were the first strategists to realize that the area's military importance matched its commercial and agricultural significance. The Sichuan basin is surrounded by the [[Hengduan Mountains]] to the west, the [[Qin Mountains]] to the north, and [[Yungui Plateau]] to the south. Since the Yangtze flows through the basin and then through the perilous Three Gorges to eastern and southern China, Sichuan was a staging area for amphibious military forces and a haven for political refugees.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Qin armies finished their conquest of the kingdoms of Shu and Ba by 316 BC. Any written records and civil achievements of earlier kingdoms were destroyed. Qin administrators introduced improved agricultural technology. [[Li Bing (Qin)|Li Bing]], engineered the [[Dujiangyan irrigation system]] to control the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min River]], a major [[tributary]] of the Yangtze. This innovative hydraulic system was composed of movable weirs which could be adjusted for high or low water flow according to the season, to either provide irrigation or prevent floods. The increased agricultural output and taxes made the area a source of provisions and men for Qin's unification of China.{{citation needed|date=April 2020}}

Sichuan was subjected to the autonomous control of kings named by the imperial family of the Han dynasty. During the 11 years hiatus between 25 and 36 AD, Sichuan was controlled by the [[Chengjia]] Kingdom. Following the declining central government of the [[Han dynasty]] in the second century, the Sichuan basin, surrounded by mountains and easily defensible, became a popular place for upstart generals to found kingdoms that challenged the authority of Yangtze Valley emperors over China.<ref name="Haw"/>

==Geography and biodiversity==
Sichuan consists of two geographically very distinct parts. The eastern part of the province is mostly within the fertile [[Sichuan basin]] (which is shared by Sichuan with Chongqing Municipality). The western Sichuan consists of numerous mountain ranges forming the easternmost part of the [[Tibetan Plateau]], which are known generically as the [[Hengduan Mountains]]. One of these ranges, the [[Daxue Mountains]], contains the highest point of the province [[Gongga Shan]], at {{cvt|7556|m|ft}} above sea level. The mountains are formed by the collision of the Tibetan Plateau with the [[Yangtze Plate]]. Faults here include the [[Longmenshan Fault]] which ruptured during the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Other mountain ranges surround the Sichuan Basin from north, east, and south. Among them are the [[Daba Mountains]], in the province's northeast.

The [[Yangtze River]] and its tributaries flow through the mountains of western Sichuan and the Sichuan Basin; thus, the province is upstream of the great cities that stand along the Yangtze River further to the east, such as [[Chongqing]], [[Wuhan]], [[Nanjing]], and [[Shanghai]]. One of the major tributaries of the Yangtze within the province is the [[Min River (Sichuan)|Min River]] of central Sichuan, which joins the Yangtze at [[Yibin]]. There are also a number of other rivers, such as the [[Jialing River]], [[Tuo River]], [[Yalong River]], [[Wu River (Yangtze tributary)|Wu River]], and [[Jinsha River]], and any four of the various rivers are often grouped as the "four rivers" that the name of Sichuan is commonly and mistakenly believed to mean.<ref name=ruf /><ref name=rowan />

Due to great differences in terrain, the climate of the province is highly variable. In general, it has strong [[monsoon]]al influences, with rainfall heavily concentrated in the summer. Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], the [[Sichuan Basin]] (including [[Chengdu]]) in the eastern half of the province experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Köppen ''Cwa'' or ''Cfa''), with long, hot, wet summers and short, mild to cool, dry, and cloudy winters. Consequently, it has China's lowest sunshine totals. The western region has mountainous areas producing a cooler but sunnier climate. Having cool to very cold winters and mild summers, temperatures generally decrease with greater elevation. However, due to its high altitude and its inland location, many areas such as Garze County and Zoige County in Sichuan exhibit a [[subarctic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dwc'')- featuring extremely cold winters down to −30&nbsp;°C and even cold summer nights. The region is geologically active with landslides and earthquakes. Average elevation ranges from 2,000 to 3,500 meters; average temperatures range from 0 to 15&nbsp;°C.<ref name=TibetansSichuan>{{cite journal |title=Study on Rural Poverty in Ecologically Fragile Areas-A Case Study of the Tibetan Areas in Sichuan Province |journal=Asian Agricultural Research |year=2012 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=27–31, 61 |url=http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/133098/2/06.PDF |access-date=26 March 2013 |author=Lan Hong-xing |publisher=USA-China Science and Culture Media Corporation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130513063229/http://ageconsearch.umn.edu/bitstream/133098/2/06.PDF |archive-date=13 May 2013 |url-status=live}}</ref> The southern part of the province, including Panzhihua and Xichang, has a sunny climate with short, very mild winters and very warm to hot summers.

Sichuan borders [[Qinghai]] to the northwest, [[Gansu]] to the north, [[Shaanxi]] to the northeast, [[Chongqing]] to the east, [[Guizhou]] to the southeast, [[Yunnan]] to the south, and the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] to the west.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Sichuan|List of current Chinese provincial leaders}}
The politics of Sichuan is structured in a dual party-government system like all other governing institutions in [[mainland China]].

The governor of Sichuan is the highest-ranking official in the People's Government of Sichuan. However, in the province's dual party-government governing system, the Governor has less power than the Sichuan Communist Party of China's [[Party Committee Secretary]], colloquially termed the "Sichuan CCP Party Chief".

==Economy==
[[File:IFS Chengdu logo and Tower 2.jpg|thumb|right|Chengdu IFS]]

Sichuan is the [[List of Chinese administrative divisions by GDP|6th-largest provincial economy]] of China, the largest in [[Western China]] and the second largest among inland provinces after [[Henan]]. As of 2021, its nominal GDP was 5,385 billion yuan (US$847.68 billion), ahead of the GDP of Turkey of 815 billion.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":2" /> Compared to a country, it would be the [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|18th-largest economy]] as well as the [[List of countries and dependencies by population|19th most populous]] as of 2021.<ref name=":1" /> As of 2021, its nominal GDP per capita was 64,357 RMB (US$10,120).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-02-07 |title=Decoding China's 2021 GDP Growth Rate: A Look at Regional Numbers |url=https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-2021-gdp-performance-a-look-at-major-provinces-and-cities/ |access-date=2022-09-15 |website=China Briefing News |language=en |archive-date=19 August 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220819091517/https://www.china-briefing.com/news/chinas-2021-gdp-performance-a-look-at-major-provinces-and-cities/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2021, the per capita net income of rural residents was 17,575 yuan (US$2760). The per capita [[disposable income]] of the urbanites averaged 41,444 yuan (US$6510).

Sichuan has been historically known as the "Province of Abundance". It is one of the major agricultural production bases of China. Grain, including rice and wheat, is the major product with output that ranked first in China in 1999. Commercial crops include citrus fruits, sugar cane, sweet potatoes, peaches, and grapes. Sichuan also had the largest output of pork among all the provinces and the second largest output of silkworm cocoons in 1999. Sichuan is rich in mineral resources. It has more than 132 kinds of proven underground mineral resources including vanadium, titanium, and lithium is the largest in China. The Panxi region alone possesses 13.3% of the reserves of iron, 93% of titanium, 69% of vanadium, and 83% of cobalt in the whole country.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tdctrade.com/mktprof/china/mpsic.htm |title=SICHUAN PROVINCE (hktdc.com) |access-date=5 February 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060208093813/http://www.tdctrade.com/mktprof/china/mpsic.htm |archive-date=8 February 2006 |url-status=live}}</ref> Sichuan also possesses China's largest proven natural gas reserves (such as the [[Dazhou gas field|Dazhou]] and [[Yuanba gas field|Yuanba gas fields]]), the majority of which are transported to more developed eastern regions.<ref name="bare_url" />

Sichuan is one of the major industrial centers of China. It was a major recipient of China's investment in industrial capacity during the [[Third Front (China)|Third Front]] campaign.<ref name=":6">{{Cite book |last=Lan |first=Xiaohuan |title=How China Works: An Introduction to China's State-led Economic Development |publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]] |year=2024 |isbn=978-981-97-0079-0 |translator-last=Topp |translator-first=Gary |doi=10.1007/978-981-97-0080-6}}</ref>{{Rp|page=298}} In addition to heavy industries such as coal, energy, iron, and steel, the province has also established a light industrial sector comprising building materials, wood processing, food, and silk processing. [[Chengdu]] and [[Mianyang]] are the production centers for textiles and electronics products. [[Deyang]], [[Panzhihua]], and [[Yibin]] are the production centers for machinery, metallurgical industries, and wine, respectively. Sichuan's wine production accounted for 21.9% of the country's total production in 2000.

Great strides have been made in developing Sichuan into a modern hi-tech industrial base, by encouraging both domestic and foreign investments in electronics and information technology (such as software), machinery and metallurgy (including automobiles), hydropower, pharmaceutical, food and beverage industries.

The auto industry is an important and key sector of the machinery industry in Sichuan. Most of the auto manufacturing companies are located in Chengdu, Mianyang, [[Nanchong]], and [[Luzhou]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr111906e.html |title=International Market Research – AUTO PARTS INDUSTRY IN SICHUAN AND CHONGQING |access-date=5 February 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060626154234/http://strategis.ic.gc.ca/epic/internet/inimr-ri.nsf/en/gr111906e.html |archive-date=26 June 2006 }}</ref>

Other important industries in Sichuan include [[aerospace]] and defense (military) industries. A number of China's rockets ([[Long March rocket]]s) and [[satellite]]s were launched from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Center]], located in the city of [[Xichang]].

Sichuan's landscapes and rich historical relics have also made the province a center for tourism.

The [[Three Gorges Dam]], the largest [[dam]] ever constructed, was built on the [[Yangtze River]] in nearby [[Hubei]] province to control flooding in the Sichuan Basin, neighboring [[Yunnan]] province, and downstream. The plan is hailed by some as China's efforts to shift towards alternative energy sources and to further develop its industrial and commercial bases, but has been denounced for mass resettlement, loss of archeological sites, and ecological damage.

==Transportation==
[[File:卡萨湖.jpg|thumb|[[China National Highway 318|Sichuan–Tibet Highway]] passes by Lake Kasa in [[Luhuo County]].]]

For millennia, Sichuan's rugged and riverine landscape presented enormous challenges to the development of transportation infrastructure, and the lack of roads out of the Sichuan Basin contributed to the region's isolation. Since the 1950s, numerous highways and railways have been built through the Qinling in the north and the Bashan in the east. Dozens of bridges [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|across the Yangtze]] and its tributaries to the south and west have brought greater connectivity with Yunnan and Tibet.

===Airports===
[[Chengdu Shuangliu International Airport]] is the 4th-busiest airport in mainland China. It was among the world's top 30 busiest airports in 2015, and the busiest in western and central China. It was also the fifth-busiest airport in terms of cargo traffic in China in 2013. Chengdu airport is the hub of [[Sichuan Airlines]], [[Chengdu Airlines]], [[Shenzhen Airlines]], [[Tibet Airlines]], [[China Southern Airlines]], [[China Eastern Airlines]], [[Lucky Air]], and [[Air China]]. Alongside Shuangliu Airport, [[Chengdu Tianfu International Airport]] has opened in 2021.

Chengdu airports are also 144-hour transit visa-free airports for foreigners from 53 countries.

===Expressways===
On 3 November 2007, the Sichuan Transportation Bureau announced that the [[G93 Chengyu Ring Expressway|Suining-Chongqing Expressway]] was completed after three years of construction. After the completion of the Chongqing section of the road, the {{cvt|36.64|km|}} expressway connected [[G42 Shanghai–Chengdu Expressway|Chengdu-Nanchong Expressway]] and formed the shortest expressway from [[Chengdu]] to [[Chongqing]]. The new expressway is {{cvt|50|km|}} shorter than the pre-existing road between Chengdu and Chongqing; thus journey time between the two cities was reduced by an hour, now taking two and a half hours. The Sui-Yu Expressway is a four-lane overpass with a speed limit of {{cvt|80|km/h|}}. The total investment was 1.045 billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]].

===Rail===
[[China Railway Chengdu Group]] is headquartered in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, managing railway systems in Sichuan, Chongqing, and Guizhou. Sichuan's major railways in Sichuan include the [[Baoji–Chengdu railway|Baoji–Chengdu]], [[Chengdu–Chongqing railway|Chengdu–Chongqing]], [[Chengdu–Kunming Railway|Chengdu–Kunming]], [[Neijiang–Kunming Railway|Neijiang–Kunming]], Suining–Chongqing, and Chengdu–Dazhou railways. [[High-speed rail]]ways in Sichuan include the [[Chengdu–Chongqing high-speed railway]], [[Xi'an–Chengdu high-speed railway|Xi'an-Chengdu high-speed railway]], [[Chengdu–Guiyang high-speed railway|Chengdu-Guiyang high-speed railway]], and Chengdu–Kunming high-speed railway. A suburban railway [[Chengdu–Dujiangyan intercity railway|connects Chengdu and Dujiangyan]].

The predominant religions in Sichuan are [[Chinese folk religion]]s, [[Taoism|Taoist traditions]], and [[Chinese Buddhism]]. According to surveys conducted in 2007 and 2009, 10.6% of the population believes and is involved in [[Chinese ancestral religion|cults of ancestors]], while 0.68% of the population identifies as [[Christianity in Sichuan|Christian]].<ref name="Wang2015"/> According to the Japanese publication ''Tokyo Sentaku'' in 1999, there were 2 million members of [[Yiguandao]] (Tiandao) in Sichuan, equal to 2.4% of the province's population.<ref name=YiguandaoSichuan/>

The reports did not give figures for other types of religion; the vast majority may be either irreligious or involved in [[Chinese folk religion]], Buddhism, etc. [[Tibetan Buddhism]] is widespread, especially in areas inhabited by ethnic Tibetans. Sichuan is one of the cradles of the early [[Zhengyi Taoism|Heavenly Masters' Taoist religious movements]].

According to "Vestiges of Zoroastrianism in Medieval Sichuan" ({{lang|zh-hant|唐宋時期巴蜀地區的火祆教遺痕}}) by Yao Chongxin, professor at Sun Yat-sen University, [[Zoroastrianism]] flourished during the period of [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] (618–907), [[Former Shu]] (907–925), [[Later Shu]] (934–965), and [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960–1279).<ref>{{cite book |last=Yao |first=Chongxin |editor-last1=Cheng |editor-first1=A-tsai |editor-last2=Wang |editor-first2=Chuan |date=1 October 2010 |chapter=唐宋時期巴蜀地區的火祆教遺痕 |trans-chapter=Vestiges of Zoroastrianism in Medieval Sichuan |title=張廣達先生八十華誕祝壽論文集 |trans-title=Papers in Celebration of the 80th Birthday of Zhang Guangda |language=zh-hant |location=New Taipei |publisher=Sin Wen Feng Publisher |pages=997–1028 |isbn=978-957-17-2120-0}}</ref>

==Culture==
{{main|Ba–Shu culture}}
{{further|Sichuanese people}}
The ''Sichuanese people'' ([[Sichuanese Mandarin|Sichuanese]]: {{lang|zh|巴蜀人}} Ba<sup>1</sup>su<sup>2</sup>ren<sup>2</sup>; [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]: {{IPA|[pa˥su˨˩zən˨˩]}}; alternatively {{lang|zh|川人}}, {{lang|zh|川渝人}}, {{lang|zh|四川人}} or {{lang|zh|巴蜀民系}}) are a subgroup of Han Chinese living in mostly Sichuan province and the neighboring [[Chongqing]] municipality. Beginning from the 9th century BC, [[Shu (kingdom)|Shu]] (on the [[Chengdu Plain]]) and [[Ba (state)|Ba]] (which had its first capital at [[Enshi City]] in [[Hubei]] and controlled part of the [[Han River (Shaanxi and Hubei)|Han Valley]]) emerged as cultural and administrative centers where two rival kingdoms were established. Although eventually, the [[Qin dynasty]] destroyed the kingdoms of Shu and Ba, the Qin government accelerated the technological and agricultural advancements of Sichuan making it comparable to that of the [[Yellow River]] Valley. The now-extinct [[Ba–Shu Chinese|Ba–Shu language]] was derived from Qin-era settlers and represents the earliest documented division from what is now called [[Middle Chinese]].

During the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] dynasties, the population of the area was reduced through wars and the [[bubonic plague]], and settlers arrived from the area of modern Hubei, replacing the earlier common Chinese with a new standard.

The [[Li Bai]] Memorial, located in [[Jiangyou]], is a museum in memory of Li Bai, a Chinese poet of [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] (618–907) built at the place where he grew up. The building was begun in 1962 on the occasion of the 1200th anniversary of his death, completed in 1981, and opened to the public in October 1982. The memorial is built in the style of the classic Tang garden.

In 2003, Sichuan had "88 art performing troupes, 185 culture centers, 133 libraries, and 52 museums". Companies based in Sichuan also produced 23 television series and one film.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.newsgd.com/specials/panprdforum/deltadetails/200405260039.htm |title=Sichuan: Education and Culture |date=2004-05-26 |access-date=2014-01-04 |publisher=newsgd.com |editor=Catherine |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150514051220/http://www.newsgd.com/specials/panprdforum/deltadetails/200405260039.htm |archive-date=14 May 2015 |url-status=live}}</ref>

===Languages===
{{Main|Sichuanese dialects|l1=Sichuanese language|Ba–Shu Chinese}}
[[File:Sichuanese in China.png|thumb|upright=0.8|right|Extent of present-day Sichuanese language]]
The Sichuanese once spoke their variety of Spoken Chinese called Ba-Shu Chinese, or Old Sichuanese before it became extinct during the Ming dynasty. Now most of them speak Sichuanese Mandarin. The Minjiang dialects are thought by some linguists{{who|date=March 2019}} to be a bona fide descendant of Old Sichuanese, but there is no conclusive evidence whether Minjiang dialects are derived from Old Sichuanese or Southwestern Mandarin.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}

The languages of Sichuan are primarily members of three subfamilies of the [[Sino-Tibetan languages]].

The most widely used variety of Chinese spoken in Sichuan is [[Sichuanese dialects|Sichuanese]], which is the [[lingua franca]] in Sichuan, [[Chongqing]], and parts of the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]]. Although Sichuanese is generally classified as a dialect of [[Mandarin Chinese]], it is highly divergent in phonology, vocabulary, and even grammar from [[Standard Chinese]].<ref name="《四川方言与巴蜀文化》">{{cite book |language=zh-hans |last1=Cui |first1=Rongchang (崔荣昌) |script-title=zh:《四川方言与巴蜀文化》 |year=1996 |publisher=[[Sichuan University]] Press |script-chapter=zh:第三章：四川的官话 |isbn=7-5614-1296-7}}</ref> The [[Minjiang dialect]] is especially difficult for speakers of other Mandarin dialects to understand.<ref>{{cite book |language=zh-hans |last1=Li |first1=Bin (李彬) |last2=Tu |first2=Minghua (涂鸣华) |script-title=zh:《百年中国新闻人（上册）》 |year=2007 |publisher=Fujian People's Press |page=563 |isbn=978-7-211-05482-4}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |language=zh-hans |script-title=zh:四川交通："窗口"飞来普通话 |last1=Wu |first1=Dan (吴丹) |last2=Liang |first2=Xiaoming (梁晓明) |script-work=zh:中国交通报 |date=23 November 2005}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |language=zh-hans |script-title=zh:大学生村官恶补四川方言 现在能用流利四川话和村民交流 |last1=Zhang |first1=Guosheng (张国盛) |last2=Yu |first2=Yong (余勇) |newspaper=[[:zh:北京晨报|Morning Post]] |date=1 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |language=zh-hans |script-title=zh:走进大山的志愿者 |script-work=zh:四川青年报 |trans-work=Sichuan Youth Paper |date=18 July 2009}}</ref>

[[Garzê Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture]] and [[Ngawa Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture]] in western Sichuan are populated by [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]] and [[Qiang people]]. Tibetans speak the [[Khams Tibetan|Khams]] and [[Amdo Tibetan]], which are [[Tibetic languages]], as well as various [[Qiangic languages]]. The Qiang speak Qiangic languages and often Tibetic languages as well. The [[Yi people]] of [[Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture]] in southern Sichuan speak the [[Nuosu language]], which is one of the [[Lolo-Burmese languages]]; Yi is written using the [[Yi script]], a [[syllabary]] standardized in 1974. The [[Southwest University for Nationalities]] has one of China's most prominent [[Tibetology]] departments and the Southwest Minorities Publishing House prints literature in minority languages.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tibetinfonet.net/content/update/143#fn2 |title=The Wuhou District (武侯区), a Tibetan enclave in Chengdu |date=2009-03-24 |access-date=2013-01-04 |issn=1864-1407 |publisher=TibetInfoNet |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105045511/http://www.tibetinfonet.net/content/update/143#fn2 |archive-date=5 January 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the minority-inhabited regions of Sichuan, there is bilingual signage and public school instruction in non-Mandarin minority languages.

===Cuisine===
{{main|Sichuan cuisine}}
Sichuan is well known for its spicy cuisine and use of [[Sichuan pepper]]s due to its humid climate.
The Sichuanese are proud of their cuisine, known as one of the Four Great Traditions of [[Chinese cuisine]]. The cuisine here is of "one dish, one shape, hundreds of dishes, hundreds of tastes", as the saying goes, to describe its acclaimed diversity. The most prominent traits of Sichuanese cuisine are described by four words: spicy, hot, fresh, and fragrant.<ref>[http://www.5hpk.com/WebUI/InfoDir/pTopicTagSearch.html?SiteId=Whpk&DirId=ys&MainClassId=ys&tag=%u5DDD%u83DC Sichuanese Cuisine] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720061416/http://www.5hpk.com/WebUI/InfoDir/pTopicTagSearch.html?SiteId=Whpk&DirId=ys&MainClassId=ys&tag=%u5DDD%u83DC |date=20 July 2008 }} {{in lang|zh}} – Pictures, descriptions, history, and examples of Sichuan cuisine.</ref> Sichuan cuisine is popular in the whole nation of China, and so are Sichuan chefs.

Another famous Sichuan delicacy is [[hot pot]]. Hot pot is a Chinese soup containing a variety of East Asian foodstuffs and ingredients, prepared with a simmering pot of soup stock at the dining table. While the hot pot is kept simmering, ingredients are placed into the pot and cooked at the table. Typical hot pot dishes include thinly sliced meat, leaf vegetables, mushrooms, wontons, egg dumplings, tofu, and seafood. The cooked food is usually eaten with a dipping sauce.
