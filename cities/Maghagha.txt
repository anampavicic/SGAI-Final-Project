'''Maghagha''' ({{langx|ar|مغاغة}}) is a [[List of cities and towns in Egypt|city]] in [[Egypt]], located on the west bank of the [[Nile]]. It is the northernmost city in the [[Minya Governorate]].

== History ==
The old names of the town were ''Nimoui'' ({{Langx|ar|نموى}}, from {{Langx|cop|ⲛⲓⲙⲟⲩⲓ|lit=islands}}) and ''Gazirat al-Hagar'' ({{Langx|ar|جزيرة الحجر|lit=stone islands}}).<ref name="مماتي197">ابن مماتي ص197</ref>

In May 1963, the ferry boat Adel capsized here, killing 206 people.

In June 2007, 11-year-old schoolgirl Budour Ahmed Shaker died at a private clinic in Maghagha after an excessive dose of [[anesthesia]] while undergoing the procedure of [[female genital cutting]], sparking widespread protests and prompting the Egyptian government to outlaw the practice by closing a legal loophole allowing it to be performed for "documented health reasons". The ban instead drove the practice underground, with doctors charging higher fees to compensate for the risk of being prosecuted.<ref name="Reuters">{{cite news |last1=Johnston |first1=Cynthia |title=Egypt death sparks debate on female circumcision |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-circumcision-egypt/egypt-death-sparks-debate-on-female-circumcision-idUSL3016886220070820 |accessdate=19 June 2020 |work=Reuters |date=August 20, 2007}}</ref>

The [[1885 Census of Egypt]] recorded Maghagha (as ''Maghaghah'') as a [[nahiyah]] in under the district of [[El Fashn]] in [[Minya Governorate]]; at that time, the population of the town was 3,126 (1,548 men and 1,578 women).<ref name="1885 Census">{{cite book |last1=Egypt min. of finance, census dept |title=Recensement général de l'Égypte |date=1885 |page=207 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OpQNAAAAQAAJ |accessdate=20 July 2020}}</ref>

In 1888, a travel guide by the British publishing house [[John Murray (publishing house)|John Murray]] described Maghagha as possessing one of the most important [[sugar]] factories in Egypt, with large tracts around the town being devoted to the cultivation of [[cane sugar]], although the amount of sugar produced at the factory had diminished in recent years. There was a [[branch line]] connecting Maghagha to [[Aba al-Waqf]] and [[Beni Mazar]]; it was used to transport cane sugar to [[sugar mill]]s during the harvest season. The guide also described several ancient ruins in the area, with a cemetery for [[Animal mummy|dog mummies]]. Just upstream from Maghagha was a rock called the ''Hagar es-Salaam'', or "stone of welfare", in the Nile near the shore. Local boatmen claimed that no journey down the Nile would be prosperous until passing this rock.<ref name="John Murray travel guide">{{cite book |title=A Handbook for Travellers in Lower and Upper Egypt |date=1888 |publisher=John Murray |page=399 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nOwbznuodoQC |accessdate=20 June 2020}}</ref>

==Economy==
Maghagha's [[souk]] is one of only two in Egypt to be government-owned (the other is in [[Shibin el-Kom]]), with fixed rental fees for vendors. Other markets in Maghagha district are privately owned, with varying rental rates. These markets are mostly held on different days, to reduce competition with one another and allow merchants to attend several different ones in the same week. To that end, some of the markets have been rescheduled in the past: for example, the souk in Bani Khalid was established in the 1940s and was originally held on Sundays. However, in the mid-1970s, improved transportation led to the market being rescheduled to Tuesdays, to reduce competition with the market in Saqola. The markets that are held on the same day owe their coexistence to distance and size factors. For example, there are three souks held on Thursday in the district: in Maghagha itself as well as in the villages of Bani Wallims (18km from Maghagha) and Shim al-Basal al-Bahariya (14km). The latter two souks are smaller ones (or ''suwayqa''s) with no more than 70 vendors; they mostly cater to the needs of local residents.<ref name="Mohieddin">{{cite book |last1=Mohieddin |first1=Mohamed M. |editor1-last=Hopkins |editor1-first=Nicholas S. |editor2-last=Westergaard |editor2-first=Kirsten |title=Directions of Change in Rural Egypt |date=1998 |publisher=American University in Cairo Press |location=Cairo |isbn=977-424-663-2 |pages=301–303 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GAQnDAAAQBAJ |accessdate=20 July 2020 |chapter=Rural Periodic Markets in Egypt}}</ref>
