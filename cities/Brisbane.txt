Another explanation of this name is ‘land shaped like a spike’. Both these are based on ''Dugai'' [European] activity and ''Dugai'' lens...

{{further|Federation of Australia}}
When the colonies federated in 1901, celebrations were held in Brisbane to mark the event, with a [[triumphal arch]] erected in [[Queen Street, Brisbane|Queen Street]]. In May that year, the [[George V|Duke of Cornwall and York]] (later King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]]) laid the [[foundation stone]] of [[St John's Cathedral (Brisbane)|St John's Cathedral]], one of the great cathedrals of [[Australia]]. The [[University of Queensland]] was founded in 1909 and first sited at [[Old Government House, Brisbane|Old Government House]], which became vacated as the government planned for a larger residence. [[Government House, Brisbane|Fernberg House]], built in 1865, became the temporary residence in 1910, and later made the permanent government house.

In 1912, Tramway employees were stood down for wearing union badges which sparked Australia's first [[general strike]], the [[1912 Brisbane General Strike]], which became known as Black Friday, for the savagery of the police baton charges on crowds of trade unionists and their supporters. In 1917, during [[World War I]], the [[Australian Government|Commonwealth Government]] conducted a [[raid on the Queensland Government Printing Office]], with the aim of confiscating copies of [[Hansard]] that covered debates in the [[Queensland Parliament]] where anti-conscription sentiments had been aired.

Russian immigration took place in the years 1911–1914. Many were radicals and revolutionaries seeking asylum from tsarist political repression in the final chaotic years of the [[Russian Empire]]; considerable numbers were Jews escaping state-inspired pogroms. They had fled Russia via [[Siberia]] and Northern China, most making their way to [[Harbin]], in [[Manchuria]], then taking passage from the port of [[Dalian]] to [[Townsville]] or Brisbane, the first Australian ports of call.<ref name=qhr>{{cite QHR|15133|St Nicholas Russian Orthodox Cathedral|600358|access-date=1 August 2014}}</ref>

These historic buildings, along with the [[Story Bridge]] which opened in 1940, are key landmarks that help define the architectural character of the city. Following the death of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]] in 1936, Albert square was widened to include the area which had been Albert Street, and renamed [[King George Square]] in honour of the King.

During World War II, Brisbane became central to the Allied campaign, since it was the northernmost city with adequate communications facilities. From July 1942 to September 1944, AMP Building (now called [[MacArthur Central]]) was used as the headquarters for [[South West Pacific Area]] under General MacArthur. MacArthur had previously rejected use of the University of Queensland complex as his headquarters, as the distinctive bends in the river at St Lucia could have aided enemy bombers.

In 1942, Brisbane was the site of a violent clash between visiting US military personnel and Australian servicemen and civilians, which resulted in one death and hundreds of injuries. This incident became known colloquially as the [[Battle of Brisbane]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/ozatwar/bob.htm|title=The Battle of Brisbane&nbsp;– 26 & 27 November 1942|publisher=Australia @ War|access-date=7 January 2008|author=Peter Dunn|date=27 August 2005|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110092844/http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/ozatwar/bob.htm|archive-date=10 January 2008}}</ref>

Despite steady growth, Brisbane's development was punctuated by infrastructure problems. The state government under [[Joh Bjelke-Petersen]] began a major program of change and urban renewal, beginning with the central business district and inner suburbs. [[Trams in Brisbane]] were a popular mode of public transport until the network was closed in 1969, in part the result of the [[Paddington tram depot fire]].

Between 1968 and 1987, Queensland was governed by Bjelke-Petersen, whose government was characterised by [[social conservatism]], [[police corruption]], and [[Queensland street marches|the brutal suppression of protest]] and has been described as a [[police state]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Robinson |first1=Shirleene |title=Issues that swung elections: the dramatic and inglorious fall of Joh Bjelke-Petersen |url=https://theconversation.com/issues-that-swung-elections-the-dramatic-and-inglorious-fall-of-joh-bjelke-petersen-115141 |website=The Conversation |date=3 May 2019 |access-date=16 February 2023 |archive-date=16 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230216155248/https://theconversation.com/issues-that-swung-elections-the-dramatic-and-inglorious-fall-of-joh-bjelke-petersen-115141 |url-status=live }}</ref> However, during this time Brisbane developed a counterculture focused on the [[University of Queensland]], [[Queensland street marches|street marches]] and [[Brisbane punk rock]] music.{{Citation needed|date=September 2024}}

In 1971, the touring [[Springboks]] were to play against the Australian Rugby team. This was met with plans for protests due to the growing international and local opposition to [[apartheid]] in South Africa. However, before their arrival Bjelke-Petersen declared a state of emergency for a month, citing the importance of the tour.<ref>Bryce, Alex. "We Would Live in Peace and Tranquility and No One Would Know Anything", Australian Academic and Research Libraries 31.3 (2000): 65–81.</ref> This did not stop the protest however with violent clashes between protestors and police erupting when several hundred demonstrators assembled outside a Brisbane motel on Thursday, 22 July 1971, where the Springbok team was staying. A second protest saw a large number of demonstrators assembled once more outside the Tower Mill Motel and after 15 minutes of peaceful protest, a brick was thrown into the motel room and police took action to clear the road and consequently disproportionate violence was used against demonstrators.<ref>Fitzgerald, Ross. "A History of Queensland, from 1915 to the 1980s", University of Queensland Press, 1985. Print.</ref>

In the lead up to the 1980s Queensland fell subject to many forms of censorship. In 1977 things had escalated from prosecutions and book burnings, under the introduction of the Literature Board of Review, to a statewide ban on protests and street marches. In September 1977 the [[Queensland Government]] introduced a ban on all street protests, resulting in a statewide civil liberties campaign of defiance.<ref>Keim, Stephen.

The end of the Bjelke-Petersen era began with the [[Fitzgerald Inquiry]] of 1987 to 1989, a judicial inquiry presided over by [[Tony Fitzgerald (judge)|Tony Fitzgerald]] investigating [[Queensland Police]] [[Police corruption|corruption]]. The inquiry resulted in the resignation of [[Premier of Queensland|Premier]] Bjelke-Petersen, the calling of two by-elections, the jailing of three former ministers and the [[Police Commissioner]] [[Terry Lewis (police officer)|Terry Lewis]] (who also lost his [[knighthood]]).

Brisbane is in the southeast corner of Queensland. The city is centred along the Brisbane River, and its eastern suburbs line the shores of Moreton Bay, a bay of the Coral Sea. The greater Brisbane region is on the coastal plain east of the [[Great Dividing Range]], with the [[Taylor Range|Taylor]] and [[D'Aguilar Range|D'Aguilar]] ranges extending into the metropolitan area. Brisbane's metropolitan area sprawls along the Moreton Bay floodplain between the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold]] and [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine]] coasts, approximately from [[Caboolture]] in the north to [[Beenleigh]] in the south, and across to [[Ipswich, Queensland|Ipswich]] in the south west.

The Brisbane River is a wide [[tide|tidal]] [[estuary]] and its waters throughout most of the metropolitan area are [[brackish]] and [[navigability|navigable]]. The river takes a winding course through the metropolitan area with many steep curves from the southwest to its mouth at Moreton Bay in the east. The metropolitan area is also traversed by several other rivers and creeks including the [[North Pine River|North Pine]] and [[South Pine River|South Pine]] rivers in the northern suburbs, which converge to form the [[Pine River (Queensland)|Pine River]] estuary at [[Bramble Bay]], the [[Caboolture River]] further north, the [[Logan River|Logan]] and [[Albert River (Queensland)|Albert]] rivers in the south-eastern suburbs, and [[tributary|tributaries]] of the Brisbane River including the [[Bremer River (Queensland)|Bremer River]] in the south-western suburbs, [[Breakfast Creek]] in the inner-north, [[Norman Creek (Queensland)|Norman Creek]] in the inner-south, [[Oxley Creek]] in the south, [[Bulimba Creek]] in the inner south-east and [[Moggill Creek]] in the west. The city is on a low-lying [[floodplain]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/12/3036241.htm?site=Brisbane |title=Flood-proof road destroyed in deluge |work=ABC News |date=12 October 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706084641/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/10/12/3036241.htm?site=Brisbane |archive-date=6 July 2014}}</ref> with the risk of flooding addressed by various state and local government regulations and plans.<ref>{{Cite web|date=9 May 2019|title=Brisbane's FloodSmart Future Strategy|url=https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-safety/disasters-and-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-in-brisbane/flood-strategy/brisbanes-floodsmart-future-strategy|access-date=24 September 2020|archive-date=28 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201028205358/https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/community-and-safety/community-safety/disasters-and-emergencies/be-prepared/flooding-in-brisbane/flood-strategy/brisbanes-floodsmart-future-strategy|url-status=live}}</ref>

The waters of Moreton Bay are sheltered from large [[swell (ocean)|swells]] by [[Moreton Island|Moreton]], [[North Stradbroke Island|Stradbroke]] and [[Bribie Island|Bribie]] islands, so whilst the bay can become rough in windy conditions, the waves at the Moreton Bay coastline are generally not [[surfing|surfable]]. Unsheltered surf beaches lie on the eastern coasts of [[Moreton Island|Moreton]], [[North Stradbroke Island|Stradbroke]] and [[Bribie Island|Bribie]] islands and on the Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast to the south and north respectively. The southern part of Moreton Bay also contains smaller islands such as [[St Helena Island National Park|St Helena Island]], [[Peel Island (Queensland)|Peel Island]], [[Coochiemudlo Island]], [[Russell Island (Moreton Bay)|Russell Island]], [[Lamb Island, Queensland|Lamb Island]] and [[Macleay Island]].

The city of Brisbane is hilly.<ref name="thenandnow">{{cite book |title=Brisbane Then and Now |last=Gregory |first=Helen |year=2007 |publisher=Salamander Books |location=Wingfield, South Australia |isbn=978-1-74173-011-1 |page=60 }}</ref> The urban area, including the central business district, are partially elevated by spurs of the [[Taylor Range (Queensland)|Herbert Taylor Range]], such as the summit of [[Mount Coot-tha, Queensland|Mount Coot-tha]], reaching up to {{convert|300|m|ft|-1|abbr=on}} and [[Enoggera Hill]]. The [[D'Aguilar National Park]], encompassing the [[D'Aguilar Range]], bounds the north-west of Brisbane's built-up area, and contains the taller peaks of [[Mount Nebo (Queensland)|Mount Nebo]], [[Camp Mountain]], [[Mount Pleasant, Queensland (Moreton Bay)|Mount Pleasant]], [[Mount Glorious]], [[Mount Samson]] and [[Mount Mee, Queensland|Mount Mee]].

Much of the rock upon which Brisbane is located is the characteristic [[Brisbane tuff]], a form of welded [[ignimbrite]],<ref name=wdhs>{{cite web|title=Brisbane Tuff|url=http://windsorhistorical.org.au/brisbane-tuff/|publisher=Windsor and Districts Historical Society|access-date=2 June 2014|archive-date=22 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201222072347/https://windsorhistorical.org.au/brisbane-tuff/|url-status=live}}</ref> which is most prominently found at the [[Kangaroo Point Cliffs]] at [[Kangaroo Point, Queensland|Kangaroo Point]] and the New Farm Cliffs on the [[Petrie Bight]] reach of the Brisbane River. The stone was used in the construction of historical buildings such as the [[Commissariat Store, Brisbane|Commissariat Store]] and [[Cathedral of St Stephen, Brisbane|Cathedral of St Stephen]], and the roadside [[curb|kerbs]] in inner areas of Brisbane are still manufactured of Brisbane tuff.

Brisbane has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''Cfa''<!-- Brisbane is Cfa, not Cwa nor is it "transitional" Cwa, because the Cwa climate would require "At least ten times as much rain in the wettest month of summer as in the driest month of winter." according to BOM data, the wettest month's average is a little over 185 mm, not the 260+ mm that would be required for a Cwa classification. -->)<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate: Brisbane – Climate graph, Temperature graph, Climate table|url=http://en.climate-data.org/location/6171/|publisher=Climate-Data.org|access-date=28 August 2013|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215043242/http://en.climate-data.org/location/6171/|archive-date=15 December 2013}}</ref> with hot, wet summers and moderately drier, mild winters.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tapper |first1=Andrew |last2=Tapper |first2=Nigel |title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Melbourne, Australia|isbn=978-0-19-558466-0|edition=Second|editor=Gray, Kathleen|page=346|chapter=Sub-Synoptic-Scale Processes and Phenomena}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last = Linacre | first = Edward | author2 = Geerts, Bart | title = Climates and Weather Explained | publisher = Routledge | location = London | year = 1997 | page = 379 | chapter = Southern Climates | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=mkZa1KLHCAQC&pg=PA379 | isbn = 0-415-12519-7 | access-date = 25 November 2020 | archive-date = 17 January 2023 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20230117222848/https://books.google.com/books?id=mkZa1KLHCAQC&pg=PA379 | url-status = live }}</ref> Brisbane experiences an annual mean minimum of {{convert|16.6|°C|°F|0}} and mean maximum of {{convert|26.6|°C|°F|0}}, making it Australia's second-hottest capital city after [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]].<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|title=Climate statistics for Australian stations – Brisbane|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_040913_All.shtml|publisher=Bureau of Meteorology|access-date=12 February 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813072724/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_040913_All.shtml|archive-date=13 August 2017}}</ref> Seasonality is not pronounced, and average maximum temperatures of above {{convert|26|°C|°F|0}} persist from October through to April.

Due to its proximity to the Coral Sea and a warm ocean current, Brisbane's overall temperature variability is somewhat less than most Australian capitals. Summers are long, hot, and wet, but temperatures only occasionally reach {{convert|35|°C|°F|0}} or more. Eighty percent of summer days record a maximum temperature of {{convert|27|to|33|°C|°F|0}}. Winters are short and warm, with average maximums of about {{convert|22|°C|°F|0}}; maximum temperatures below {{convert|20|°C|°F|0}} are rare.

In 2009, Brisbane recorded its hottest winter day (from June to August) at {{convert|35.4|°C|°F|1}} on 24 August;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/hot-august-day-as-records-fall-20090824-evxp.html|title=Hot August day as Records Fall|work=[[Brisbane Times]]|author=Unknown|date=24 August 2009|access-date=31 August 2010|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090827141847/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/hot-august-day-as-records-fall-20090824-evxp.html|archive-date=27 August 2009}}</ref> The average July day however is around {{convert|22|°C|°F|0}} with sunny skies and low humidity, occasionally as high as {{convert|27|°C|°F|0}}, whilst maximum temperatures below {{convert|18|°C|°F|0}} are uncommon and usually associated with brief periods of cloud and winter rain.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> The highest minimum temperature ever recorded in Brisbane was {{convert|28.0|°C|°F|1}} on 29 January 1940 and again on 21 January 2017, whilst the lowest maximum temperature was {{convert|10.2|°C|°F|1}} on 12 August 1954.<ref name="ReferenceB"/>

Annual precipitation is ample. From November to March, thunderstorms are common over Brisbane, with the more severe events accompanied by large damaging hail stones, torrential rain and destructive winds. On an annual basis, Brisbane averages 124 clear days, with overcast skies more common in the warmer months.<ref>{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_040223_All|site_name=Brisbane Aero|access-date=20 November 2014}}</ref> Dewpoints in the summer average at around {{convert|20|°C|°F|0}}; the [[apparent temperature]] exceeds {{convert|30|°C|°F|0}} on almost all summer days.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_040913_All|site_name=Brisbane|access-date=16 June 2013}}</ref> Brisbane's wettest day occurred on 21 January 1887, when {{convert|465|mm|in}} of rain fell on the city, the highest maximum daily rainfall of Australia's capital cities. The wettest month on record was February 1893, when {{convert|1025.9|mm|in}} of rain fell, although in the last 30 years the record monthly rainfall has been a much lower {{convert|479.8|mm|in}} from December 2010. Very occasionally a whole month will pass with no recorded rainfall, the last time this happened was August 1991.<ref name="ReferenceB"/> The city has suffered four major floods since its founding, in [[1893 Brisbane flood|February 1893]], [[1974 Brisbane Flood|January 1974]] (partially a result of [[Cyclone Wanda]]), [[2010–2011 Queensland floods|January 2011]] (partially a result of [[Cyclone Tasha]]) and [[2022 eastern Australia floods|February 2022]].

Brisbane is within the southern reaches of the [[tropical cyclone]] risk zone. Full-strength tropical cyclones rarely affect Brisbane, but occasionally do so. The biggest risk is from ex-tropical cyclones, which can cause destructive winds and flooding rains.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Tropical Cyclone Risks|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/webtemp/image_cache/GA4205.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713154744/http://www.ga.gov.au/webtemp/image_cache/GA4205.pdf|archive-date=13 July 2018|access-date=22 December 2020|website=[[Geoscience Australia]]}}</ref>

==Urban structure==
[[File:Brisbane CBD seen from Mount Coot-tha Lookout, 2023, 01.jpg|thumb|The [[Brisbane CBD]] and surrounding metropolitan area from [[Mount Coot-tha Lookout]] in the [[Taylor Range]]]]
The [[Brisbane central business district]] (CBD, colloquially referred to as "the city") lies in a curve of the Brisbane river. The CBD covers {{convert|2.2|km2|sqmi|1|abbr=on}} and is walkable. Most central streets are named after members of the [[House of Hanover]]. [[Queen Street, Brisbane|Queen Street]] (named in honour of [[Queen Victoria]]) is Brisbane's traditional [[main street]] and contains its largest [[Pedestrian zone|pedestrian mall]], the [[Queen Street Mall]]. Streets named after female members ([[Adelaide Street, Brisbane|Adelaide]], [[Alice Street, Brisbane|Alice]], [[Ann Street, Brisbane|Ann]], [[Charlotte Street, Brisbane|Charlotte]], [[Elizabeth Street, Brisbane|Elizabeth]], [[Margaret Street, Brisbane|Margaret]], and [[Mary Street, Brisbane|Mary]]) run parallel to [[Queen Street, Brisbane|Queen Street]] and perpendicular to streets named after male members ([[Albert Street, Brisbane|Albert]], [[Edward Street, Brisbane|Edward]], [[George Street, Brisbane|George]], and [[William Street, Brisbane|William]]).

The CBD's [[Town square|squares]] include [[King George Square]], [[Post Office Square, Brisbane|Post Office Square]] and [[ANZAC Square, Brisbane|ANZAC Square]] (home to the city's central [[war memorial]]).
[[File:River views of Brisbane CBD, October 2018, 03.jpg|thumb|The [[Brisbane CBD|CBD]] and [[South Bank, Queensland|South Bank]] fronts the [[Brisbane River]]]]
Brisbane's metropolitan area is broadly and colloquially divided into the northside and the southside, with the dividing line being the [[Brisbane River]],<ref>{{cite web|title=North v South: Brisbane's Watery Divide|url=https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/north-v-south-brisbane-s-watery-divide-20181121-p50hdc.html|work=[[Brisbane Times]]|date=21 November 2018|access-date=18 April 2020|archive-date=27 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200727035855/https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/national/queensland/north-v-south-brisbane-s-watery-divide-20181121-p50hdc.html|url-status=live}}</ref> as crossing one of the 15 [[Bridges over the Brisbane River|bridges across the river]] is required to travel to the opposite side by land transport. This results in many areas which are south of the CBD being classified as located in the northside, and vice versa, as a result of the river's winding, mostly south-west, trajectory. In addition to being classified as located on the northside or southside there are further broad and colloquial regions such as the westside for some areas to the southwest of the CBD and the bayside for areas located on the coast of [[Moreton Bay]].

Greater Brisbane had a density of {{convert|159|PD/sqkm}} in 2021.<ref name="auto5"/> Like most Australian cities, Brisbane has a sprawling metropolitan area which takes in excess of one hour to traverse either north to south or east to west by car without traffic.

From the 1970s onwards, there has been a large increase in the construction of [[apartment]] developments, including [[low-rise building|mid-rise]] and [[high-rise building|high rise]] buildings, which has quickened in the 21st century. At the 2021 census, 73.4% of residents lived in [[Single-family detached home|separate houses]], 14.7% lived in [[apartment]]s, and 11.4% lived in [[townhouse]]s, [[terrace house]]s, or [[semidetached]] houses.<ref name="auto5"/>

===Parklands===
[[File:Tree lined avenue at the City Botanic Gardens, Brisbane.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ficus macrophylla|Moreton Bay fig]]s at the [[City Botanic Gardens]]]]
Brisbane's major parklands include the riverside [[City Botanic Gardens]] at [[Gardens Point, Brisbane|Gardens Point]],<ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |date=2015-06-09 |title=Brisbane Botanic Gardens {{!}} Environment, land and water |url=https://apps.des.qld.gov.au/heritage-register/detail/?id=600067 |access-date=2024-02-07 |website=apps.des.qld.gov.au |language=en-AU}}</ref> [[Roma Street Parkland]], the 27-hectare [[Victoria Park, Brisbane|Victoria Park]] at [[Spring Hill, Queensland|Spring Hill]] and [[Herston, Queensland|Herston]], [[South Bank Parklands]] along the river at [[South Bank, Queensland|South Bank]], the [[Brisbane Botanic Gardens, Mount Coot-tha|Brisbane Botanic Gardens]] at [[Mount Coot-tha, Queensland|Mount Coot-tha]] and the riverside [[New Farm Park]] at [[New Farm, Queensland|New Farm]].

There are many national parks surrounding the Brisbane metropolitan area. The [[D'Aguilar National Park]] is a major [[national park]] along the northwest of the metropolitan area in the [[D'Aguilar Range]]. The [[Glass House Mountains National Park]] is located to the north of the metropolitan area in the [[Glass House Mountains, Queensland|Glass House Mountains]] and provides green space between the Brisbane metropolitan area and the [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]]. The [[Tamborine National Park]] at [[Tamborine Mountain]] is located in the [[Gold Coast hinterland]] to the south of the metropolitan area.

The eastern metropolitan area is built along the [[Moreton Bay Marine Park]], encompassing [[Moreton Bay]]. Significant areas of [[Moreton Island|Moreton]], [[North Stradbroke Island|North Stradbroke]] and [[Bribie Island|Bribie]] islands also covered by the [[Moreton Island National Park]], [[Naree Budjong Djara National Park]] and the [[Bribie Island National Park]] respectively. The [[Boondall Wetlands]] in the suburb of [[Boondall, Queensland|Boondall]] include 1,100 hectares of wetlands which are home to [[Australian mangroves|mangroves]] and [[wader|shorebirds]] as well as walking tracks.

One of the  oldest synagogues in the Queensland area is the Brisbane Synagogue located on Margaret Street in Brisbane city. This historic synagogue can be attributed as the “centerpiece of the  Jewish community’s  presence  in  the  state”(Arnold,Creese 157). It was established in 1866 and designed by architect  Arthur Morry. Another architect by the name of Andrea Stombuco has also been credited as a designer of the synagogue by previous members of the community(Arnold,Creese 157).

Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called stilts), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aids in cooling. The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks leading to few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size.{{Citation needed|date=January 2023}} These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.

Unlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]], which is the largest local government area (in terms of population and budget) in Australia, serving more than 40% of the GCCSA's population. It was formed by the merger of twenty smaller LGAs in 1925, and covers an area of {{Convert|1367|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}}. The remainder of the metropolitan area falls into the LGAs of [[Logan City]] to the south, [[City of Moreton Bay]] in the northern suburbs, the [[City of Ipswich]] to the south west, [[Redland City]] to the south east, and into the [[Somerset Region|Somerset]], [[Scenic Rim Region|Scenic Rim]] and [[Lockyer Valley Region|Lockyer Valley]] regions on the urban periphery. Several of these are also among the nation's most populous LGAs.

Each LGA is governed under a similar structure, including a directly elected mayor (including the [[Lord Mayor of Brisbane]]), as well as a council composed of councillors representing geographical wards. [[Brisbane City Hall]] is the seat of the [[Brisbane City Council]], the governing corporation of the City of Brisbane LGA, and the bulk of its executive offices are located at the [[Brisbane Square]] skyscraper.
