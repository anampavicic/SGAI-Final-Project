'''Stoke-on-Trent''' (often abbreviated to '''Stoke''') is a city and [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority area]] in [[Staffordshire]], England, with an area of {{convert|36|sqmi|km2|0}}. In 2022, the city had an estimated population of 259,965.<ref>{{cite web |title=Stoke-on-Trent Population Change |url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/visualisations/censuspopulationchange/E06000021/ |website=ons.gov,uk |access-date=November 21, 2023}}</ref><ref name="2019-pop">{{cite web|url=https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationestimates/datasets/populationestimatesforukenglandandwalesscotlandandnorthernireland|title=Estimates of the population for the UK, England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland|website=[[Office for National Statistics]]|access-date=24 January 2021}}</ref> It is the largest settlement in Staffordshire and is surrounded by the towns of [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]], [[Alsager]], [[Kidsgrove]] and [[Biddulph]], which form a [[conurbation]] around the city.

The city is [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric]], formed from [[Federation of Stoke-on-Trent|the federation of six towns]] in 1910. It took its name from the town of [[Stoke-upon-Trent]] where the main centre of government and the principal [[Stoke-on-Trent railway station|railway station]] in the district were located. [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]] is the primary commercial centre. The other four towns which form the city are [[Burslem]], [[Tunstall, Staffordshire|Tunstall]], [[Longton, Staffordshire|Longton]] and [[Fenton, Staffordshire|Fenton]].

The home of the [[pottery]] industry in England, it is known as [[Staffordshire Potteries|The Potteries]]. It is a centre for [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service industries]] and [[Distribution (marketing)|distribution centres]]. It formerly had a primarily [[heavy industry]] sector.

==History==

===Toponymy and etymology===
The name ''Stoke'' is taken from the town of [[Stoke-upon-Trent]], the original [[civil parish|ancient parish]], with other settlements being [[Chapelry|chapelries]].<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2835945.stm Mayor backs Stoke name change] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111204844/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2835945.stm |date=11 January 2009 }}, BBC News, 10 March 2003</ref> ''Stoke'' derives from the [[Old English]] ''stoc'', a word that at first meant little more than ''place'', but which subsequently gained more specific – but divergent – connotations. These variant meanings included ''dairy farm'', ''secondary or dependent place or farm'', ''summer pasture'', ''crossing place'', ''meeting place'' and ''place of worship''. It is unknown which of these was intended here, and all are plausible. 

The most frequently suggested interpretations derive from a crossing point on the [[Roman roads|Roman road]] that ran from present-day [[Derby]] to [[Chesterton, Staffordshire|Chesterton]] or the early presence of a [[Stoke Minster|church]], said to have been founded in 670 AD. Because ''Stoke'' was such a common name for a settlement, some kind of distinguishing [[affix]] was usually added later, in this case, the name of the [[River Trent|river]].

The motto of Stoke-on-Trent is ''Vis Unita Fortior'' which can be translated as: United Strength is Stronger, or Strength United is the More Powerful, or A United Force is Stronger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepotteries.org/sot/index.htm|title=Facts and figures about Stoke-on-Trent|access-date=10 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922015728/http://www.thepotteries.org/sot/index.htm|archive-date=22 September 2008|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Administration===
{{See also|Federation of Stoke-on-Trent}}
An early proposal for a federation took place in 1888 when an amendment was raised to the [[Local Government Act 1888|Local Government Bill]] which would have made the six towns into districts within a county of "Staffordshire Potteries". On 1 April 1910 the "Six Towns" were brought together. The [[county borough]] of Hanley, the [[municipal borough]]s of Burslem, Longton, and Stoke, together with the [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban districts]] of Tunstall and Fenton now formed a single county borough of Stoke-on-Trent.<ref>{{cite news |title=A New County Borough |work=The Times |location=UK |date=21 March 1910}}</ref>

In 1919, the borough proposed to expand further and annex the neighbouring borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme and the [[Wolstanton United Urban District]], both to the west of Stoke. This never took place, due to strong objections from Newcastle Corporation.<ref>{{cite news |title="Greater Potteries" Scheme: Extension of Stoke-on-Trent |work=The Times |location=UK |date=25 April 1919}}</ref> A further attempt was made in 1930, with the promotion of the Stoke-on-Trent Extension Bill.<ref>{{cite news |title=Stoke-on-Trent Bill: Extension of the City |work=The Times |location=UK |date=2 May 1930}}</ref> Ultimately, Wolstanton was instead added to Newcastle-under-Lyme in 1932. Although attempts to merge Newcastle, Wolstanton and [[Kidsgrove]] (north of Tunstall) were never successful, the borough expanded in 1922, taking in [[Smallthorne Urban District]] and parts of other parishes from [[Stoke upon Trent Rural District]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beckett |first1=J. V. |title=City status in the British Isles, 1830–2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC |year=2005 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0-7546-5067-6 }}</ref>

The borough was granted [[city status in the United Kingdom|city status]] in 1925, with a [[lord mayor]] from 1928. When the county borough of Stoke-on-Trent initially applied for city status in 1925, citing its importance as the centre of the pottery industry, it was refused by the [[Home Office]] as it had fewer than 300,000 inhabitants. The decision was overturned, when a direct approach was made to [[King George V]], who agreed that the borough ought to be a city. The public announcement of the elevation to city status was made by the king during a visit to Stoke in June 1925.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beckett |first1=J. V. |title=City status in the British Isles, 1830–2002 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jqqSSOyjBEoC |year=2005 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0-7546-5067-6 }}</ref>

The county borough was abolished in 1974. Stoke became a [[non-metropolitan district]] of Staffordshire. Its status as a unitary authority was restored in April 1997. It remains part of the [[Ceremonial counties of England|ceremonial county]] of Staffordshire. For [[Eurostat]] purposes it is a [[NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom|NUTS 3 region]] (code UKG23).

Since the 17th century, the area has been almost exclusively known for its industrial-scale pottery manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepotteries.org/sot/five.htm|title=all about Stoke-on-Trent in 5 minutes...|access-date=10 September 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915190319/http://www.thepotteries.org/sot/five.htm|archive-date=15 September 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> Companies such as [[Royal Doulton]], [[Dudson]], [[Spode]] (founded by [[Josiah Spode]]), [[Wedgwood]] (founded by [[Josiah Wedgwood]]), [[Mintons Ltd|Minton]] (founded by [[Thomas Minton]]) and Baker & Co. (founded by William Baker) were established and based there. The local abundance of coal and clay suitable for earthenware production led to the early (initially limited) development of the local pottery industry. The construction of the [[Trent and Mersey Canal]] (completed in 1777) enabled the import of [[Kaolinite|china clay]] from [[Cornwall]] together with other materials and facilitated the production of [[creamware]] and [[bone china]].

Other production centres in Britain, Europe and worldwide had a considerable lead in the production of high-quality wares. Methodical and highly detailed research and experimentation, carried out over many years, nurtured the development of artistic talent throughout the local community and raised the profile of [[Staffordshire Potteries]]. This was spearheaded by one man, [[Josiah Wedgwood]], who cut the first sod for the canal in 1766 and erected his [[Etruria Works]] that year. 

Wedgwood built upon the successes of earlier local potters such as his mentor [[Thomas Whieldon]] and along with scientists and engineers, raised the pottery business to a new level. [[Josiah Spode]] introduced [[bone china]] at Trent in 1796, and [[Thomas Minton]] opened his manufactory. With the industry came a large number of notable 20th-century ceramic artists including [[Clarice Cliff]], [[Susie Cooper]], [[Charlotte Rhead]], [[Frederick Hurten Rhead]] and [[Jabez Vodrey]].

====Coal mining====
[[File:Film Photo Whitfield Colliery.jpg|thumb|Chatterley Whitfield Colliery]]
North Staffordshire was a centre for coal mining. The first reports of coal mining in the area come from the 13th century.<ref name=staffspasttrack/> The Potteries Coalfield (part of the North Staffordshire Coalfield) covers {{convert|100|sqmi|km2|-2}}.<ref name=staffspasttrack>{{cite web |url=http://www.staffspasttrack.org.uk/exhibit/coal/historical%20overview/historicaloverview.htm |title=Coal Mining in North Staffordshire |publisher=Staffordshire County Council, Keele University, Staffordshire Learning Net |work=Staffordshire Past Track |access-date=20 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070531060704/http://www.staffspasttrack.org.uk/exhibit/coal/historical%20overview/historicaloverview.htm |archive-date=31 May 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Striking coal miners in the [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]] and [[Longton, Staffordshire|Longton]] area ignited the nationwide [[1842 General Strike]] and its associated [[1842 Pottery Riots|Pottery Riots]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Fyson |first=R |editor1-first=Epstein |editor1-last=J |editor2-last=Thompson |editor2-first=D |title=The Chartist Experience: Studies in Working-Class Radicalism and Culture, 1830–1860 |publisher=Macmillan |location=London |year=1982 |chapter=The Crisis of 1842: Chartism, the Colliers' Strike and the Outbreak in the Potteries |pages=[https://archive.org/details/chartistexperien0000unse/page/194 194–195, 214–216] |isbn=978-0-333-32972-6 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/chartistexperien0000unse/page/194 }}</ref>

When coal mining was [[National Coal Board|nationalised]] in 1947, about 20,000 men worked in the industry in Stoke-on-Trent. Notable Collieries included Hanley Deep Pit, Trentham Superpit (formerly Hem Heath, Stafford and Florence Collieries), Fenton Glebe, [[Silverdale Colliery|Silverdale]], Victoria, Mossfield, Parkhall, Norton, [[Chatterley Whitfield]] and [[Wolstanton]].<ref name=staffspasttrack/> The industry developed greatly, and new investments in mining projects were planned within the City boundaries as recently as the 1990s.<ref>[http://www.stokecoll.ac.uk/NSCFWEB/Sentinel/1991.htm stokecoll.ac.uk] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229144432/http://www.stokecoll.ac.uk/NSCFWeb/Sentinel/1991.htm |date=29 December 2008 }} Evening Sentinel (28 March 1991) Page 22 Co.</ref> However, 1994 saw the last pit to close as the Trentham Superpit was shut.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.urbed.com/cgi-bin/main.cgi?org_code=fffgggretyuiopef57&option=article&doc_id=44 |title=Trentham Lakes – Successful URBED strategy |access-date=20 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060150/http://www.urbed.com/cgi-bin/main.cgi?org_code=fffgggretyuiopef57&option=article&doc_id=44 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The Stoke mining industry set several national and international records. [[Wolstanton]] Colliery, when modernised, had the deepest mining shafts in Europe at 3,197&nbsp;ft.<ref>{{ISBN|978-0-19-955129-3}} The Riches Beneath our Feet: How Mining Shaped Britain by Geoff Coyle (2010)</ref> In 1933, Chatterley Whitfield Colliery became the first Colliery in the country to mine one million tons of coal. In the 1980s Florence Colliery in [[Longton, Staffordshire|Longton]] repeatedly set regional and national production records; in 1992 the combined Trentham Superpit (Hem Heath and Florence) was the first mine in Europe to produce 2.5&nbsp;million saleable tonnes of coal.

Today the mines are all closed, though the scars of mining remain on the landscape. Slag heaps are still visible on the skyline, now covered with flora and fauna. The [[Chatterley Whitfield]] site reopened as a museum two years after its closure in 1976. The museum closed in 1991 and the site became a [[local nature reserve]]. It was declared a [[scheduled monument]] by English Heritage in 1993.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=0&N=&ID=508 |title=Local Nature Reserves – Whitfield Valley<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=20 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020222247/http://www.lnr.naturalengland.org.uk/Special/lnr/lnr_details.asp?C=0&N=&ID=508 |archive-date=20 October 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.chatwhitfriends.org.uk/ |title=The Friends of Chatterley Whitfield<!-- Bot generated title --> |access-date=20 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120216080920/http://www.chatwhitfriends.org.uk/ |archive-date=16 February 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref> The abandoned subterranean mines are inaccessible, though they still add complications to many building projects and occasionally cause minor tremors, detectable only by specialised equipment.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/staffordshire/8486316.stm|title=Mine works cause tremors in Stoke-on-Trent |date=28 January 2010|work=BBC News |access-date=29 January 2010}}</ref>

====Steel====
The iron and steel industries occupied important roles in the development of the city, both before and after the federation. Especially notable were those mills located in the valley at Goldendale and [[Shelton, Staffordshire|Shelton]] below the hill towns of [[Tunstall, Staffordshire|Tunstall]], Burslem and Hanley. [[Shelton Bar|Shelton Steelworks]]' production of steel ended in 1978—instead of producing crude steel, they concentrated on rolling steel billet which was transported from [[Scunthorpe]] by rail. The rolling plant finally closed in 2002.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.search.exploringthepotteries.org.uk/engine/resource/default.asp?theme=451&originator=%2Fengine%2Ftheme%2Fdefault%2Easp&page=&records=&direction=&pointer=2191&text=1&resource=553 |title=Blast furnace demolition at Shelton Bar Steel Works |access-date=20 May 2007 |publisher=Stoke-on-Trent museum |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928043758/http://www.search.exploringthepotteries.org.uk/engine/resource/default.asp?theme=451&originator=%2Fengine%2Ftheme%2Fdefault.asp&page=&records=&direction=&pointer=2191&text=1&resource=553 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> From 1864 to 1927 Stoke housed the [[Stoke railway works|repair shops]] of the [[North Staffordshire Railway]]<ref>{{cite book |last1=Larkin |first1=Edgar J |last2=Larkin |first2=John G |year=1988 |title=The Railway Workshops of Great Britain 1823–1986 |publisher=Macmillan Press |isbn=978-0-333-39431-1}}</ref> and was the home of independent railway locomotive manufacturers [[Kerr, Stuart and Company]] from 1881 to 1930.<ref>{{cite journal |title=The Kerr Stuart Wren Class |last=Horsman |first=Geoffrey |journal=The Industrial Railway Record |issue=5 & 6 |pages=85–99 |date=December 1964 |url=http://www.irsociety.co.uk/Archives/5+6/KS_Wren.htm |access-date=20 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629072457/http://www.irsociety.co.uk/Archives/5+6/KS_Wren.htm |archive-date=29 June 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Shelton Steel Works and the mining operations were heavily involved in the World War II industrial effort. Central to the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]]'s success was the [[Supermarine Spitfire]] designed by [[R. J. Mitchell|Reginald Mitchell]] who, whilst born at 115 Congleton Road in the nearby village of [[Butt Lane]], had his [[apprenticeship]] at Kerr, Stuart and Company's railway works.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/local_heroes/g_m/mitchell.shtml |title=Hugh Bourne, the religious reformer who also promoted social change |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |work=BBC Stoke & Staffordshire |year=2002 |access-date=20 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070821005731/http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/local_heroes/g_m/mitchell.shtml |archive-date=21 August 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Michelin]] tyre company has a presence in Stoke-on-Trent, and in the 1920s built their first UK plant in the city. In the 1980s nearly 9,000 workers were employed at the plant.

For [[Eurostat]] purposes, it is a [[NUTS statistical regions of the United Kingdom|NUTS 3 region]] (code UKG23); it is also one of four counties or unitary districts that compose the Shropshire and Staffordshire NUTS 2 region.

Stoke-on-Trent is often known as "the city of five towns", the name given to it by local novelist [[Arnold Bennett]], and is the only [[wikt:polycentric|polycentric city]] in the UK. In his novels, Bennett used mostly recognisable aliases for five of the six towns, although he called Stoke "Knype". Bennett said that he believed "Five Towns" was more euphonious than "Six Towns", so he omitted Fenton, now sometimes referred to as "the forgotten town".

As it is a city made up of multiple towns, the city forms a [[conurbation]]. In this case, the conurbation is bigger than Stoke itself, because the urban area of Stoke is contiguous with that of administratively separate Newcastle.

The six towns run in a rough line from north to south along the [[A50 road]] – Tunstall, Burslem, Hanley, Stoke, Fenton and Longton. Although the city is named after the original town of Stoke, and the City Council offices are located there, the city centre is usually regarded as being in Hanley, which had earlier developed into a major commercial centre.

As well as [[Newcastle-under-Lyme]], other nearby towns include [[Crewe]], [[Nantwich]], [[Congleton]], [[Biddulph]], [[Kidsgrove]], [[Stafford]], [[Uttoxeter]], [[Eccleshall]], [[Cheadle, Staffordshire|Cheadle]], [[Stone, Staffordshire|Stone]] and [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]].

===Suburbs===
As well as the Six Towns, there are numerous suburbs. These include [[Abbey Hulton]], [[Stockton Brook]], [[Adderley Green]], Ball Green, [[Baddeley Green]], [[Bentilee]], [[Birches Head]], [[Blurton]], [[Bucknall, Staffordshire|Bucknall]], [[Bradeley]], [[Chell, Staffordshire|Chell]], [[Cliffe Vale, Staffordshire|Cliffe Vale]], [[Cobridge]], [[Dresden, Staffordshire|Dresden]], [[Etruria, Staffordshire|Etruria]], Fegg Hayes, Florence, [[Goldenhill]], [[Hartshill, Staffordshire|Hartshill]], [[Heron Cross]], [[Meir, Staffordshire|Meir]], Meir Park, Meir Hay, [[Middleport, Staffordshire|Middleport]], [[Milton, Staffordshire|Milton]],Newstead,Normacot, [[Norton le Moors]], Oakhill, Packmoor, [[Penkhull]], Sandyford, [[Shelton, Staffordshire|Shelton]], [[Smallthorne]], [[Sneyd Green]], [[Trentham, Staffordshire|Trentham]], [[Trent Vale]] and [[Weston Coyney]]. [[Blythe Bridge]], [[Werrington, Staffordshire|Werrington]] and [[Endon]], although outside the city's boundaries, are part of the built-up area.

===Climate===
Stoke-on-Trent, as with all of the United Kingdom, experiences a temperate [[maritime climate]], lacking in weather extremes. The local area is a little more elevated than much of Staffordshire and Cheshire, resulting in cooler temperatures year-round compared to the nearby Cheshire Plain. On calm, clear nights this is often reversed as cold air drainage causes a [[temperature inversion]] to occur. As such, the Stoke-on-Trent and Newcastle areas are generally not susceptible to severe frosts. The nearest [[Met Office]] weather station is [[Keele University]], about four miles west of the city centre.

[[File:Stoke-on-trent terrace housing.jpg|thumb|Terraced housing is a common feature in the city.]]

Stoke-on-Trent was a world centre for fine ceramics—a skilled design trade has existed in the area since at least the 12th century. In the late 1980s and 1990s Stoke-on-Trent was hit hard by the general decline in the British manufacturing sector. Numerous factories, [[steel mill|steelworks]], [[coal mining|collieries]], and [[pottery|potteries]] were closed, including the renowned [[Shelton Bar]] steelworks. This resulted in a sharp rise in unemployment in the 'high-skilled but low-paid' workforce.

The pottery firm [[Wedgwood]] and its subsidiary [[Royal Doulton]] are based nearby [[Barlaston]], although much production now takes place in the firm's [[Indonesia]]n factory. [[Portmeirion Pottery|Portmeirion]] is based in Stoke town, and now owns the [[Spode]] and [[Royal Worcester]] ceramics brands. Ceramics firm [[Emma Bridgewater]] is based in Hanley. [[Burleigh Pottery]] is in Middleport. [[Wade Ceramics]] is in Etruria. 

[[Moorcroft]] and Royal Stafford are based in Burslem. [[Aynsley China]] is in Longton, and is one of the last remaining manufacturers of [[bone china]] in the city. Fine china manufacturer [[Dudson]] have premises in Hanley and Burslem. [[Churchill China]] have their main factory in Tunstall. Hotelware manufacturer [[Steelite]] is based in Middleport at the former Dunn Bennett site.

About 9,000 firms are based in the city. Amongst the more notable are [[Bet365]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marquest.com/mqweb.dll/casestudies?date=01/11/2005%2010:33:10 |title=MarQuest Ensures Reliability of bet365's Online Gaming Services |access-date=20 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827160308/http://www.marquest.com/mqweb.dll/casestudies?date=01%2F11%2F2005%2010%3A33%3A10 |archive-date=27 August 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> founded by local businessman and [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] chairman [[Peter Coates]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bookmakersreview.com/c/News/20-07-2006_Peter_Coates_plays_down_the_threat_of_an_American_crackdown_on_internet_gambling/ |title=Peter Coates plays down the threat of an American crackdown on internet gambling |work=Bookmakers Review |publisher=BetReview Ltd |date=20 July 2006 |access-date=20 May 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206103639/http://www.bookmakersreview.com/c/News/20-07-2006_Peter_Coates_plays_down_the_threat_of_an_American_crackdown_on_internet_gambling/ |archive-date=6 December 2007 |url-status=live }}</ref> and formerly [[Phones4U]], a large retailer of mobile phones started by [[John Caudwell]],{{citation needed|date=September 2020}} until it ceased trading in September 2014.

Stoke City Football Club has been a major symbol of the city since the early 20th century, having spent most of its history in the highest two divisions of the English league, constantly attracting large crowds and signing or launching the careers of many high-profile players – most notably [[Stanley Matthews]] and [[Gordon Banks]]. The club was based at the [[Victoria Ground]] in [[Stoke-upon-Trent]] from 1878 until 1997 when it moved to the Britannia Stadium (now the [[Bet365 Stadium]]) at Trentham Lakes. This was one of the early stages of regeneration in the Trentham area of the city, which included the regeneration of [[Trentham Estate|Trentham Gardens]] several years later when retail and food outlets were added to the visitor attraction. Trentham Monkey Forest opened nearby in 2005.

The [[Michelin]] tyre company has a complex in the city which houses its commercial head office, training centre and a truck tyre re-treading facility. [[Sainsbury's]] supermarket and [[The Co-operative Pharmacy]] have large warehouses in the city. [[Vodafone]] has a large call centre on Festival Park and the UK subsidiary of the lubricant manufacturer [[Fuchs Petrolub]] has its head office at its factory in Hanley. There is a steel foundry owned by [[Goodwin Steel Castings Ltd]] in Joiner's Square. [[Premier Foods]] make [[Mr Kipling]] slices and [[Bakewell tart|Cherry Bakewells]] in Trent Vale. [[The Co-operative Travel]] had its head office in Burslem, before it merged with [[Thomas Cook Group|Thomas Cook]] in 2010.

KPMG's ''[[Competitive Alternatives]] 2004'' report declared Stoke-on-Trent to be the most cost-effective place to set up a new UK business.<ref>{{cite press release |title=UK has lowest business costs in Europe according to KPMG study |publisher=KPMG UK |date=18 February 2004 |url=http://www.kpmg.co.uk/news/detail.cfm?pr=1874 |access-date=10 September 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214043603/http://www.kpmg.co.uk/news/detail.cfm?pr=1874 |archive-date=14 February 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The city currently has the advantage of offering affordable business property, while being surrounded by a belt of affluent areas such as the [[Peak District]], [[Stone, Staffordshire|Stone]], south [[Cheshire]], and has excellent road links via the A500 and nearby [[M6 motorway|M6]] and rail links.

Tourism to the city was kick-started by the [[Stoke-on-Trent Garden Festival|National Garden Festival]] in 1986 and is now sustained by the many pottery factory shops and tours and by the improved canal network.

[[File:Hanley stoke on trent city centre.jpg|thumb|[[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]], Stoke-on-Trent City Centre.]]

The main shopping centre is the [[Potteries Shopping Centre]] in Hanley, which has {{convert|561000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} of retail space with 87 units including major stores for [[New Look (store)|New Look]], [[Monsoon Stores Ltd|Monsoon]], [[HMV]], [[River Island]], [[H. Samuel]] and [[Superdrug]]. [[Marks & Spencer]] and [[T.K. Maxx]] also have stores in Hanley. A new shopping centre on the site of Hanley's former bus station was due to open in 2016, but development has been delayed and the project is now in doubt.<ref>{{cite web|title=City Sentral|url=http://www.citysentral.co.uk/|access-date=10 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622050117/http://www.citysentral.co.uk/|archive-date=22 June 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Mayoral system===
{{main|Lord Mayor of Stoke-on-Trent}}
[[File:Stoke-on-Trent Town Hall (geograph 4569782).jpg|thumb|[[Stoke-upon-Trent Town Hall]]]]
The position of Lord Mayor is largely ceremonial. The title of Lord Mayor was first conferred on the City of Stoke-on-Trent by King [[George V of the United Kingdom|George V]] who visited [[Stoke-upon-Trent Town Hall]] to award the town city status on 5 June 1925.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.macearchive.org/films/king-george-v-and-queen-mary-visit-stoke-trent-5th-june-1925  |title=King George V and Queen Mary visit Stoke-on-Trent |date=5 June 1925|publisher=Mace Archive| access-date=29 January 2021}}</ref> The role of Lord Mayor is decided upon by a vote amongst the elected councillors. The candidates are also selected from the councillors.

Between 1910 and 1928 the Borough, and later, the City of Stoke-on-Trent had a Mayor rather than a Lord Mayor.  The first Mayor of Stoke-on-Trent was [[Cecil Wedgwood]] of the Wedgwood pottery dynasty.<ref>{{cite book|last=Warrillow|first=Ernest J.

[[File:Staffordshire university stoke campus frontage.jpg|thumb|Staffordshire University Stoke campus]]

There are four further and higher education institutions in the local area, the two further education colleges being [[City of Stoke-on-Trent Sixth Form College]] and [[Stoke-on-Trent College]]. Formerly of Fenton, now located in a newly built structure on Leek Road, the Sixth Form College provides [[GCE Advanced Level|A Level]] teaching for around 1,800 students. Stoke-on-Trent College is much larger and less specialised, offering apprenticeships and adult education, and has a main campus (Cauldon Campus) in Shelton, and a secondary campus in Burslem.

The city is home to [[Staffordshire University]], formerly North Staffordshire Polytechnic, with its main site in Shelton, near Stoke-on-Trent railway station. It gained its university status in 1992 as one of the [[New Universities|post-1992 universities]]. [[Keele University Medical School|Keele University School of Medicine]] uses facilities at the [[Royal Stoke University Hospital]] in [[Hartshill]]. [[Keele University]] was founded as the University College of North Staffordshire in 1949 with major involvement by Stoke-on-Trent City Council. It is located in the nearby village of [[Keele]].

===Secondary education===

===Potters' Holidays===
One of the legacies of the pottery industry was Stoke's version of the [[wakes week]]. Although better known in industrial Lancashire, the Stoke week is known locally as the Potters' Holidays<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pitsnpots.co.uk/2009/06/potters-holidays-the-sad-demise |title=Potters Holidays – The Sad Demise! |date=25 June 2009 |access-date=21 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722141725/http://pitsnpots.co.uk/2009/06/potters-holidays-the-sad-demise |archive-date=22 July 2011 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> or Potters' Fortnight and occurred the last week in June, the first week in July and another week in August. This gave what appeared to be strange school holidays—with the summer term having a two-week break at the end of June, then children returning to school for three weeks before taking a five-week summer holiday. This observance has disappeared from the local schools, due to decreased emphasis on traditional industries.

The Potters were revived in 1960 and they raced in the Provincial League until the end of 1963, when the stadium was closed and the site redeveloped. Speedway was revived at [[Loomer Road Stadium]] in Newcastle-under-Lyme, initially as Chesterton, before it reverted to the Stoke name. The stadium is also used for [[BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars]] and [[BriSCA Formula 2 Stock Cars]] during the summer.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Cycle Speedway was popular in the city from the 1940s. Boys would travel all over the city to race against rival teams.

==Culture, art, science and architecture==
[[File:Burslem school of art.JPG|thumb|right|[[Burslem School of Art]]]]

===Architecture===

From the [[Half timbered|half-timbered]] [[Vernacular architecture|farmhouse vernacular]] of [[Ford Green Hall]], through the 18th-century canal-side [[Wedgwood]] estate of [[Etruria Works|Etruria]] one of the hubs of the [[Industrial Revolution]], to 19th-century country house estates e.g. [[Trentham Estate|Trentham Hall]] and railway buildings such as [[Stoke-on-Trent railway station|Stoke Station]] and more lately in the 20th century, the expansion and renewal of industrial, civic and amenity buildings including [[Potteries Museum and Art Gallery]], the architecture of North Staffordshire has a history expressive of locally acquired or manufactured building materials: quarried stone, coal and clay for brick and tile-making, ash, sand gravel and cement for concrete, and also cast iron steel and timber.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Stoke-on-Trent's architecture is tied closely to the [[industrial heritage]] of the city. [[Bottle oven]]s (used for early pottery manufacture), canal-side and railway-related mill, factory, or warehouse buildings evolved – within the tightly knit street pattern of each of the six townships – from transport links and adjacency to local generationally skilled labour. Post-WWII pottery factories developed a style typified by [[Open plan|open-plan]] manufacturing areas, surrounded by wide expanses of window-walling from floor to ceiling, allowing good daylighting for intricate tasks such as [[lithography]], fettling and decoration.

The Grade II* listed statue of ''Perseus with the Head of Medusa'', which stands adjacent to the lake at Trentham Gardens, a part of [[Trentham Estate]], is a copy of an original work by [[Benvenuto Cellini]], which was sculpted for [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I Duke of Tuscany]] from 1545 to 1554. In the early 19th century, the then Duke of Tuscany, allowed a cast of Cellini's statue to be taken for his friend, the 2nd Duke of Sutherland; it is the only bronze cast of the statue<ref>{{cite web |title=Perseus with the Head of Medusa |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1374226?section=official-list-entry |website=Historic England |access-date=2 September 2022}}</ref> The bronze sculpture was installed at Trentham in 1840 during Charles Barry's remodelling of the estate and the statue forms a focal point for his Italianate gardens located by the lake at the south end of the central axis of the parterre. Barry designed the circular platform on which the statue is set.

==Dialect==
{{main|Potteries dialect}}
The Potteries has a distinctive [[Potteries dialect|local dialect]]. It contains many non-standard words, e.g. ''nesh'' meaning "soft, tender, or to easily get cold",<ref name=dialect /> and ''slat'' meaning "to throw".<ref name=dialect /> The best-known word is ''duck'', which is used as a greeting to either men or women. It is believed to be derived from the [[Old English|Saxon]] word ''ducas'', used to indicate respect. In [[Middle English]] this became ''duc'' or ''duk'', which denotes a leader. It became the title ''[[Duke]]'' and the [[Old French]] word ''duché'', which indicates the territory ruled by a Duke.<ref name=dialect>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/voices2005/features/steve_birks.shtml |title=Voices – The history of the Potteries dialect |access-date=14 May 2007 |work=BBC Stoke & Staffordshire |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080128130736/http://www.bbc.co.uk/stoke/voices2005/features/steve_birks.shtml |archive-date=28 January 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Another common variation on the standard English dialect is the use of the word ''shug'' for sugar. This is usually used as a term of endearment when closing a sentence, as in "Ta Shug" (thank you, sugar).{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}
