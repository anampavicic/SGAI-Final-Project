{{nihongo|'''Ube'''|宇部市|Ube-shi}} is a [[Cities of Japan|city]] located in [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]], [[Japan]]. {{As of|2023|05|31}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 159,256 in 80,010 households and a [[population density]] of 560 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Ube-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.ube.yamaguchi.jp|title= Ube City official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> The total area of the city is {{convert| 286.65|sqkm|sqmi}}.

==Geography==
Ube is located on the [[Seto Inland Sea]] in southwestern Yamaguchi Prefecture. The city limits are the lower reaches of the Koto River system and the upper reaches of the Ariho River system, which flows through the central and western part of the prefecture from north to south. The urban area spreads out on the plains on both sides of the Koto River mouth and on the flat land along the coast, forming a densely populated area. Most of the flat land in the south was reclaimed by seabed coalfields, and the place names such as 'Unoshima' and 'Hamacho' are remnants of this. A gentle mountainous area spreads from the central part to the northern part of the city, and in recent years development has been promoted with the construction of [[industrial park]]s and new residential areas. In addition, the Konan area in the western part of the city is mostly reclaimed land for the purpose of rice cultivation. The area used to be a rural area with extensive [[paddy field]]s, but the area is increasingly urbanized with condominium developments.

==History==
Ube is part of ancient [[Nagato Province]]. The [[Kotozaki Hachiman-gu]] shrine dates from the [[Heian period]] and the local Koto clan, a branch of the [[Mononobe clan]] dominated the area into the [[Kamakura period]]. The area became part of the holdings of the [[Ōuchi clan]] in the [[Muromachi period]] and subsequently part of [[Chōshū Domain]] under the [[Mōri clan]] under the [[Edo period]] [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. The village of Ube (宇部村) was established within [[Asa District, Yamaguchi]] with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. Ube was elevated directly to city status on November 1, 1921 in a rare direct elevation from village to city.

From April to August 1945, 254 people were killed, 557 were injured, and 68 were missing due to eight [[Strategic bombing during World War II|air raid]]s during [[World War II]]. The scale of the air raid on July 2 was particularly large, and most of the central part of the city was destroyed by fire. In the air raid on July 29, three mock [[atomic bomb]]s were dropped.

Previously a [[coal mining]] town, the city has developed an effective policy to improve its environment. In particular it has combated the problem of [[air pollution]] and its success in doing so saw it being recognised by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] as among UNEP's Global 500 Roll of Honour in 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.grida.no/news/default/1723.aspx|title=Ube city of Japan receives UN environment award|work=GRID Arendal|access-date=September 29, 2016}}</ref>

On November 1, 2004, the town of [[Kusunoki, Yamaguchi|Kusunoki]] (from [[Asa District, Yamaguchi|Asa District]]) was merged into Ube. This brought the city to its current extent, together with previous municipal mergers ([[Fujiyama, Yamaguchi|Fujiyama]] in 1931, [[Kōnan, Yamaguchi|Kōnan]] in 1941, [[Nishi-Kiwa, Yamaguchi|NishKiwa]] in 1943, Great Shōwa mergers/1954: [[Kotō, Yamaguchi|Kotō]], [[Futamatase, Yamaguchi|Futamatase]], [[Ono (Asa, Yamaguchi)|Ono]], [[Higashi-Kiwa, Yamaguchi|Higashi-Kiwa]]).

==Government==
Ube has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 28 members. Ube contributes five members to the Yamaguchi Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is part of the [[Yamaguchi 3rd district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Uve has a heavily industrialized economy centered on heavy industry and chemicals. [[Ube Industries]] is headquartered and has major plants in Ube. Also, petroleum refinery Solato, printer manufacturer Riso Kagaku, glass manufacturer Central Glass, semiconductor producer Renesas, pharmaceutical research and products company [[Kyowa Hakko Kirin]], clinical laboratory research company Miraca Holdings are based in Ube.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[File:Ubebridge.jpg|thumb|250px|A bridge in [[Tokiwa Park]]]]
Ube publicizes itself as "a city of greenery, flowers, and sculptures". [[Tokiwa Park]] is the centerpiece of this [[marketing]], as it covers a large area near the center of the city and houses a large number of modern, mostly domestic sculptures on the shores of Lake Tokiwa. The sculptures can be found around the city. A sculpture competition is held biennially to provide new additions.

A well-known attraction of the park was a [[great white pelican]] called "Katta-kun", so named after his parents who were from [[Kolkata, India]]. Hatched in the park in 1985, he became famous as he began visiting schools in the vicinity. Katta-kun died in 2008, but there are a number of pelicans still residing in an enclosure there. In addition to the pelicans there were many [[mute swans]] and [[black swans]] residing there until 2011, when they were culled after an outbreak of [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H1N5 avian influenza]]. Two new mute swans were introduced in 2017.

There is a coal mining museum with a view over the city and airport.

===Festivals===
Ube holds two [[matsuri|festivals]] each year, one in May and the other in November featuring food stands and carnival games.
