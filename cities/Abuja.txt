The indigenous inhabitants of Abuja are the Abawa, [[Basa languages|Basa]], [[Gwandara]], [[Gbagyi]] (Gwari) having the majority population in the region. Other groups in the area include the [[Gade (language)|Gade]], [[Dibo language|Dibo]], Egburra, Nupe and [[Nkoroo language|Koro]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Barnabas |first=Sylvanus Gbendazhi |date=2018-08-03 |title=Abuja Peoples of Nigeria as Indigenous Peoples in International Law |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/15718115-02502002 |journal=International Journal on Minority and Group Rights |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=431–457 |doi=10.1163/15718115-02502002 |s2cid=150133231 |issn=1385-4879}}</ref>

The [[Gwandara]] speaking people in Abuja are mostly found in AMAC and Bwari Area Council.

Another impetus for Abuja came because of [[Lagos]]' population boom that made that city overcrowded and conditions squalid.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Makinde |first1=Adeyinka |title=Abuja: Constructing Nigeria's Federal Capital {{!}} Ambitious Plans, Corrupt Practices {{!}} 1983 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPxOIU0-nlE&ab_channel=AdeyinkaMakinde |website=Youtube |date=15 May 2020 |access-date=6 September 2020}}</ref> As Lagos was already undergoing rapid economic development, the Nigerian regime felt the need to expand the economy towards the inner part of the country, and hence decided to move its capital to Abuja.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.naij.com/574434-nigeriaat55-top-5-reasons-nigerias-capital-moved-lagos-abuja-photos.html|title=#NigeriaAt55: Top 5 Reasons Nigeria's Capital Was Moved From Lagos To Abuja (PHOTOS)|first=Omotayo|last=Yusuf|date=1 October 2015}}</ref> The logic used was similar to the way Brazil planned its capital, [[Brasília]].

The move of Nigeria's Capital to Abuja was controversial, and the biggest opposition to it was led by [[Obafemi Awolowo]].<ref name="jstor.org">{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Jonathan |title=The Political History of Nigeria's New Capital |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |date=March 1984 |volume=22 |issue=1 |page=173 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00056846 |jstor=160334 |s2cid=154848195 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/160334 |access-date=22 September 2020}}</ref> Awolowo, as a politician and a representative of the Yoruba people, defended their claims against the move of the Capital from Lagos. During the hotly-contested campaign for the presidency, he vowed to hire the American [[Walt Disney Company]] to convert the new site (Abuja) into an amusement park if he was elected.<ref name="jstor.org" /> However, after his election as president, Alhaji [[Shehu Shagari]] laid the first foundation for Abuja's infrastructure and pushed for its early completion. His first journey outside of Lagos after his election was to Abuja, where he visited contractors and workers on site to urge a speedy completion of the project. On his return, he confided in Alhaji [[Abubakar Koko]] his disappointment with the slow progress of work.<ref name="jstor.org" /> Shehu Shagari rescheduled the planned relocation to Abuja from 1986 to 1982 which later proved difficult.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=Jonathan |title=The Political History of Nigeria's New Capital |journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies |date=March 1984 |volume=22 |issue=1 |page=174 |doi=10.1017/S0022278X00056846 |jstor=160334 |s2cid=154848195 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/160334 |access-date=22 September 2020}}</ref>

The International Planning Associates (IPA) was commissioned in June 1977, by the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA)<ref>{{Cite web |title=Federal Capital Development Authority – Builders of Abuja, Nigeria |url=http://fcda.gov.ng/ |access-date=2024-06-27 |language=en-US}}</ref> to produce the Abuja Master Plan and its regional grid.<ref>{{cite book|last=Elleh|first= Nnamdi|title= Abuja, the single most ambitious urban design project of the 20th century|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=huHVAAAAMAAJ&q=+%22Wallace%2C+McHarg%2C+Roberts+and+Todd%22|year= 2001|publisher= VDG, Verlag und Datenbank für Geisteswissenschaften|isbn= 978-3-89739-165-9}}</ref> According to the terms of reference, the master planning process was to include a review of relevant data, selection of a capital city site, preparation of regional and city plans and the accompanying design and development standards manual.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shuaibu |first1=Umar |title=Unsung heroes of Abuja master plan |date=16 March 2020 |url=https://viewpointhousingnews.com/2020/03/16/unsung-heroes-of-abuja-master-plan/ |access-date=22 September 2020}}</ref>

IPA did not exist prior to the Nigerian Government's engagement with an internationally reputable firm to design the master plan. IPA was formed by a consortium of three American firms which won the worldwide competitive bidding. The firms were Planning Research Corporation (PRC), Wallace, McHarg, Roberts and Todd, and Archisystems (a division of the Hughes Organisation). After winning the bid, and completing the project, the firms were disbanded.

The final report was submitted to the pioneer Executive Secretary of FCDA, Alhaji [[Abubakar Koko]], on 15 February 1979. In the preface to the master plan, the following declaration was made by IPA:
{{Blockquote|text="The master plan for Abuja the new Capital City of Nigeria represents the culmination of 18 months' work by the Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) board, and several advisory panel consultants. Without the unstinting efforts of these experts, the momentum now exhibited at the beginning of the actual implementation of the new capital could not have been achieved. The plan itself represents a milestone in the process of building the new capital city. It is a necessary element in the monumental effort about to be undertaken by the Nigerian people."}}

The master plan for Abuja defined the general structure and major design elements of the city that are now visible. More detailed design of the central areas of the capital, particularly its monumental core, was accomplished by Japanese architect [[Kenzo Tange]], with his team of city planners at Kenzo Tange and Urtec company.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Alkasum|first=Abba|title=Abuja: The Making of a Capital City, 1976–2006|year=2012}}</ref> Most countries relocated their [[embassy|embassies]] to Abuja, and many maintain their former embassies as [[Consul (representative)|consulates]] in [[Lagos]], the commercial capital of Nigeria.{{Citation needed|date=February 2023}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nigeria's commercial capital, Lagos, shuts schools amid COVID-19 |website=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-nigeria-lagos-idUSKBN28S2S4 |access-date=11 February 2024}}</ref> Abuja is the headquarters of the [[ECOWAS|Economic Community of West African States]] (ECOWAS) and the regional headquarters of [[OPEC]].

The AMAC's chairman is responsible for leading the council's activities and representing the interests of the municipality's residents.<ref>{{Citation |last1=Olokesusi |first1=Femi |title=Smart Metropolitan Regional Development of Abuja and Its Region |date=2019 |work=Smart Metropolitan Regional Development: Economic and Spatial Design Strategies |pages=797–825 |editor-last=Vinod Kumar |editor-first=T.M. |url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-8588-8_14 |access-date=2024-04-23 |place=Singapore |publisher=Springer |language=en |doi=10.1007/978-981-10-8588-8_14 |isbn=978-981-10-8588-8 |last2=Aiyegbajeje |first2=Femi Ola |last3=Arije |first3=Ibitayo Modupe}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=ABUJA METROPOLITAN MANAGEMENT COUNCIL – Federal Capital Territory – FCT – Abuja – Nigeria |url=http://fcta.gov.ng/ova_dep/abuja-metropolitan-management-council/ |access-date=2024-04-23 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Federal Government of Nigeria|title=Government's views on the Report of the Panel on the decree N0.6. 1976|year=1991}}</ref> The Minister of the FCT, [[Nyesom Wike]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ogbuenyi |first=Nosike |date=2023-08-21 |title=The significance of Wike's appointment as FCT minister, By Nosike Ogbuenyi |url=https://www.premiumtimesng.com/opinion/617065-the-significance-of-wikes-appointment-as-fct-minister-by-nosike-ogbuenyi.html |access-date=2023-08-26 |website=Premium Times Nigeria |language=en-GB}}</ref> heads the FCTA while AMAC's chairman is Christopher Zaka Maikalangu.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Kwen |first=James |date=2022-02-13 |title=Abuja polls: PDP wins 3 chairmanship, APC gets two |url=https://businessday.ng/news/article/abuja-polls-pdp-wins-3-chairmanship-apc-gets-two/ |access-date=2023-08-26 |website=Businessday NG |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Abuchi |first=Joe |date=2024-04-22 |title=AMAC chairman pledges quick completion of Kugbo road |url=https://authorityngr.com/2024/04/22/amac-chairman-pledges-quick-completion-of-kugbo-road/ |access-date=2024-04-23 |website=THE AUTHORITY NEWS |language=en-US}}</ref>

For ease and co-ordination of developmental efforts, the city was divided into 'Phases' by its planners, with the city's development taking a concentric form with Phase 1, which consists of the city's inner districts-Central Area, Maitama, Asokoro, Wuse, Wuse II, Garki, Garki II, Guzape and Guzape II-at its core spreading out from the foot of Aso Rock, while Phase 5, consisting of the newly created Kyami District covering the vicinity of the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport<ref>{{Cite web |title=NAIA, Abuja. |url=https://faan.gov.ng/naia-abuja/ |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=FAAN |language=en-GB}}</ref> and the permanent campus of the University of Abuja, over 40 kilometres west of Aso Rock. Each Phase is separated from the other by an expressway (some still under construction); for example, Phases 1 and 2 are separated from each other by the Nnamdi Azikiwe expressway, while the entirety of the city proper (Phases 1–5) is enclosed by the Murtala Muhammed (Outer Northern-ONEX and Outer Southern-OSEX) expressways as well as the Federal A2 highway which traverses the Federal Capital Territory on its way to Kaduna (north-bound) and Lokoja (south-bound). Thus, there is an integration of the city's road network with the Federal highway network, providing access to the immediate outlying countryside and the surrounding states of the country i.e. Niger State to the west, Kaduna State to the north, Nasarawa State to the east and Kogi State to the south.{{Citation needed|date=April 2024}}

Abuja is organised into phases, which are further divided into districts.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Galadima |first=Mukhtar |date=2022-10-27 |title=Population influx and Abuja's emerging districts |url=https://dailytrust.com/population-influx-and-abujas-emerging-districts/ |access-date=2024-04-23 |website=Daily Trust |language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Phase 1 ====

===== Asokoro District =====
{{Main article|Asokoro}}
[[Asokoro]], the [[doyen]] of the districts, houses all of the state's lodges/guesthouses. The ECOWAS<ref>{{Cite web |last=Inaju-Challydoff |first=Daniel |title=Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) |url=https://www.ecowas.int/ |access-date=2024-06-27 |language=en}}</ref> secretariat is a focal point of interest. Asokoro is to the east of Garki District and south of Central District. It is one of the most exclusive districts of Abuja and houses virtually all of the federal cabinet ministers as well as most of the diplomatic community in the city; in addition, the Presidential Palace (commonly referred to as the Aso Rock) is in Asokoro District. By virtue of this fact, Asokoro is the most secure area of the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Asokoro Abuja {{!}} Area Guide |url=https://www.villaafrika.com/asokoro-district-guide/ |access-date=2024-04-23 |website=Villa Afrika Realty |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last=Aga |first=Chiegeonu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IcmwBgAAQBAJ |title=Nigeria: State by State |publisher=Lulu.com |isbn=978-1-105-86432-2 |language=en}}</ref>

===== Central Business District =====
Abuja's [[Central District, Abuja|Central District]], also called Central Area, is a strip of land stretching from [[Aso Rock]] in the east to the National Stadium and the Old City gate in the West. It is like the city's spinal cord, dividing it into the northern sector with Maitama and Wuse, and the southern sector with Garki and Asokoro. While each district has its own clearly demarcated commercial and residential sectors, the Central District is the city's principal Business Zone, where practically all parastatals and [[multinational corporations]] have their offices. An attractive area in the Central District is the region known as the '''Three Arms Zone''', so-called because it houses the administrative offices of the executive, legislative and judicial arms of the federal government. A few of the other sites worth seeing in the area are the federal secretariats alongside Shehu Shagari Way, Aso Hill, the Abuja Plant Nursery, [[Eagle Square, Abuja|Eagle Square]] (which has important historic significance, as it was in this grounds that the present democratic dispensation had its origin on 29 May 1999) and in which all subsequent Presidential Inauguration ceremonies have taken place. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier is situated across Shehu Shagari Way facing Eagle Square. This section is usually closed to traffic during the annual Armed Forces Remembrance Day ceremonies that is observed on 15 January. The [[Abuja National Mosque|National Mosque]] and [[National Church of Nigeria]] are opposite each other on either side of Independence Avenue.<ref>{{cite web |date=18 November 2012 |title=Independence Avenue |url=http://wikimapia.org/street/16260013/Independence-Ave |access-date=2013-08-30 |publisher=Wikimapia.org}}</ref> A well-known government office is the Ministry of Defense, colloquially nicknamed "Ship House".<ref>{{cite web |date=18 November 2012 |title=Ship House |url=http://wikimapia.org/9452603/Ministry-of-Defense-Ship-House |access-date=2013-08-30 |publisher=Wikimapia.org}}</ref> Also located here is the yet-to-be-completed National Square, Millennium tower and Nigeria Cultural Centre multi-functional complex.

===== Garki District =====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
The [[Garki District, Abuja|Garki District]] is the area in the southwest corner of the city, having the Central District to the north and the Asokoro District to the east. The district is subdivided into units called "Areas". Garki uses a distinctive naming convention of "Area" to refer to parts of Garki. These are designated as Areas 1 to 11. Garki II is used to differentiate the area from Garki Area 2. Visitors may find this system confusing.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Abuja City's Garki District - wtcf.travel |url=https://en.wtcf.org.cn/destination/2015-01/16/c_38841.htm |access-date=2023-05-17 |website=en.wtcf.org.cn}}</ref>

Garki is presently the principal business and administrative district of Abuja. Numerous buildings of interest are in this area. Some of them include the General Post Office, Abuja International Conference Centre along the busy Herbert Macaulay Way, Nicon Luxury Hotel (formally known as Abuja Sofitel Hotel and Le Meridian), Agura Hotel and Old Federal Secretariat Complex Buildings (Area 1). A new five-star hotel, Hawthorn Suites Abuja, is in Garki.{{cn|date=May 2024}}

Area 2 is mainly used for residential purposes, although a zoological garden, as well as a small shopping centre, are to be found here as well. Several banks and other commercial offices are located along Moshood Abiola Way in Area 7. The headquarters of the Nigerian Armed Forces – Army, Airforce and Navy – is located on Muhammadu Buhari Way in the Garki District.

The tallest building in this district is the Radio House located in the Area 11 sector, which houses the Federal Ministry of Information and Communications, the [[Federal Radio Corporation of Nigeria]] (FRCN) and Voice of Nigeria (VON). The [[Nigerian Television Authority]] (NTA) stations and corporate headquarters are also in Garki. The Federal Capital Development Authority (FCDA) which oversees and runs the Administration of the Federal Capital Territory has its offices in Garki.

The Office of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory is in Area 11.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Office of the Minister – FCT Residents Engagement Platform |url=https://myfctagov.ng/index.php/person-category/office-of-the-minister/ |access-date=2023-05-17 |language=en-US}}</ref> This is the location of the Federal Capital Development Authority and other administrative buildings. A popular sub-neighbourhood here is found in the vicinity of Gimbiya Street because it has the unique characteristic of being a purely administrative zone on weekdays while transforming purely into an entertainment zone on weeknights and weekends.<ref>{{cite web |title=Abuja City Tour Guide |url=https://mmmhouse.org/abuja-city-tour-guide/ |access-date=2020-05-26 |website=mmmHouse Abuja! |language=en-US}}</ref>
[[File:Jabi_lake_mall.jpg|thumb|Jabi lake mall]]
Other places of note include the Cyprian Ekwensi Arts & Culture Centre and The Nigerian Police Mobile Force CID (Criminal Investigation Department) headquarters in Area 10. The Abuja Municipal Area Council, which is the local government administration has its headquarters in Area 10. The new United States Embassy is in the Diplomatic Zone which adjoins Garki.

===== Guzape District =====

===== Maitama District =====
{{Main article|Maitama}}
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Abuja_Millennium_Park.jpg|thumb|Millennium Park water fountain at night]]
Maitama District is to the north of the city, with the [[Wuse]] and Central Districts lying to its southwest and southeast respectively. This area is home to the top-bracket sections of society and business and has the reputation of being very exclusive and very expensive. Interesting buildings include the Transcorp Hilton Abuja,<ref>{{cite web |title=Transcorp Hilton Abuja |url=https://www.hilton.com/en/hotels/abuhitw-transcorp-hilton-abuja/ |access-date=23 April 2022 |publisher=Hilton Hotels and Resorts}}</ref> [[Nigerian Communications Commission]] Headquarters (NCC), [[National Universities Commission]] (NUC), Soil Conservation Complex, and [[Independent National Electoral Commission]] (INEC). The British High Commission is located along [[Aguiyi Ironsi]] Way, in Maitama. Also, the Maitama District Hospital is another notable building in Maitama. Maitama District is home to many of the European and Asian embassies.

====== Maitama II ======
Maitama II District Cadastral Zone A10 is a new district created by the FCT administration of Muhammed Bello in 2018. Maitama 2 as it is unofficially called was created from Mpape Hills, a suburb bothering the Bwari and Maitama Districts of the FCT. Maitama II has a high net worth of individuals especially legislators as allottees, which makes it a destination for real estate investors who desire to secure the future today.

It is not very clear what the government plans for the district as not much has been said by government agents, but cadastral zoning A indicates the government has good plans for Maitama 2 to correct some errors in Maitama District.
[[File:Abuja_Millenium_Park_2019_01.jpg|left|thumb|[[Millennium Park (Abuja)|Millennium Park]] in Maitama District]]
It was learned that plots of land were revoked from allottees of Mpape district to create the new Maitama II District, although a compensation plan is underway to relocate the revoked allottees to another district the government intends to create. Fortunately, some developers of the Mpape district who have building plan approval and have started building maintain their plots and allocations and are covered in the Maitama II District layout. It is not clear though if a fresh allocation bearing Maitama II District has been issued to this set of allottees.

Notable landmarks of the Maitama 2 district are Jubilation Avenue, Mount Pleasant Haven and Hilltop Estate.

The district infrastructure is in top gear as the Federal Government had in the 2018 and 2019 budgets allocated about N1.3b for the engineering design of the district. Villages around the district are living in fear of demolition at any time with the information reaching them that government will commence the infrastructure project of Maitama II District.<ref>{{cite web |date=29 May 2022 |title=Maitama II Infrastructure to Commence Soon |url=https://leadership.ng/2020/08/21/provision-of-infrastructure-in-maitama-2-to-commence-soon/ |website=leadership.ng}}</ref>

===== Wuse District =====
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
Wuse District is the northwestern part of the city, with the Maitama District to its north and the Central District to its south. The District is numbered Zones 1–6. The Wuse Market is Abuja's principal market. The second most important post office in the city is here. This district houses the Sheraton Hotel and Towers (Zone 4), Grand Ibro International Hotel, the [[Federal Road Safety Corps (Nigeria)|Federal Road Safety Corps]] Headquarters (Zone 3), [[Nigeria Customs Service|Nigerian Customs Services]] Headquarters, Federal Civil Service Commission (Zone 3), [[National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control|National Agency for Food and Drugs Administration]] (NAFDAC) (Zone 7), Wuse General Hospital, and the [[Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation]]. Just as Garki District has Garki II, Wuse has Wuse II. This is distinct from Wuse Zone 2. Like other inner Abuja districts such as Asokoro or Garki, there are very few large housing estates. Instead, office buildings, mansions and apartment blocks are prominent features of the area.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-09-27 |title=Geographical and Environmental Backgrounds of FCT, Abuja - Abuja OIPedia |url=https://abujaoipedia.org/content/geographical-and-environmental-backgrounds-of-fct-abuja/ |access-date=2023-05-17 |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Here is what you need to know about Wuse; the commercial hub of Abuja |url=https://estateintel.com/insights/here-is-what-you-need-to-know-about-wuse-the-commercial-hub-of-abuja |access-date=2023-05-17 |website=estateintel.com}}</ref>

== Cityscape ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2018}}
[[File:Abuja Stadium 4.jpg|thumbnail|Spectators at a football match held at the [[Abuja National Stadium]]]]

The Abuja skyline is made up of mostly mid-range and a few tall buildings. Only recently have tall buildings begun to appear. Most of the buildings are modern, reflecting that it is a new city.

Plans were made to build skyscrapers such as the [[Millennium Tower (Abuja)|Millennium Tower]] which is partly completed as work has stalled for the last few years. This structure looms {{Convert|170|m}} above the city. The tower is part of a huge cultural development complex called the Nigeria National Complex including the Nigeria Cultural Centre, a {{Convert|120000|m2|abbr=on|adj=on}} structure dedicated to the art and culture of Nigeria. The Cultural Centre and the Millennium Tower have been designed by the Italian architect [[Manfredi Nicoletti]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|last=M.F.C.T|title=Abuja: Achievements of the federal capital territory 1985–1992|year=1995}}</ref>

Landmarks include the [[Millennium Tower (Abuja)|Millennium Tower]], the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] headquarters, the [[Nigerian Presidential Complex]], the Ship House, the [[Abuja National Stadium|National Stadium]], which was the main venue of the 2003 All Africa Games and some games, including the final, of the 2009 FIFA Under-17 World Cup, [[Abuja National Mosque|National Mosque]], the [[National Church of Nigeria|National Church]], [[Aso Rock]] and [[Zuma Rock]].<ref name=":1" />

=== Parks and open areas ===
[[File:Jabi lake.jpg|thumb|Jabi lake]]
Abuja is home to several parks and green areas with the largest one being [[Millennium Park (Abuja)|Millennium Park]]. Millennium Park was designed by architect [[Manfredi Nicoletti]] and was officially opened by the United Kingdom's [[Queen Elizabeth II]] (the former [[Queen of Nigeria]]) in December 2003. Another open area park is located in Lifecamp Gwarimpa; near the residence of the Minister of the Federal Capital Territory. The park is located on a slightly raised hilltop which contains sports facilities like Basketball and Badminton courts another park is the city park, which is located in Wuse 2 and is home to numerous outdoor and indoor attractions such as a 4D cinema, Astro-turf, lawn tennis court, paintball arena and a variety of restaurants. The National Children's Park and Zoo host a number of animals and recreation spots.<ref>{{cite web |title=23 things to do in Abuja |url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g293825-d14977048-Reviews-National_Children_s_Park_and_Zoo-Abuja_Federal_Capital_Territory.html |website=tripadvisor |access-date=23 September 2020}}</ref>

==== Bush Bars ====
Abuja has a variety of informal spaces known as "Bush Bars" that usually, though not always, include a covered area with tables and chairs where people can sit and have drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and sometimes there are snacks such as [[suya]], grilled [[catfish]], pounded [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[egusi]] soup and other small items available for purchase. They are located all over Abuja.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy|title=Sunday, August 27, 2006 Abuja bush bars|url=http://www.naijablog.co.uk/2006/08/abuja-bush-bars.html|access-date=22 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223312/http://www.naijablog.co.uk/2006/08/abuja-bush-bars.html|archive-date=2 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Nigerian Suya Recipe: For Nigerians in Diaspora|url=http://www.allnigerianrecipes.com/snacks/nigerian-suya-recipe.html|publisher=allnigerianrecipes.com|year=2013}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Abuja under [[Köppen climate classification]] features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Aw''). The FCT experiences three weather conditions annually. This includes a warm, humid [[rainy season]] and a blistering [[dry season]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Climate: Abuja Federal Capital Territory, Nigeria|url=https://www.worlddata.info/africa/nigeria/climate-abuja-federal-capital-territory.php|access-date=2022-01-08|website=Worlddata.info|language=en}}</ref> In between the two, there is a brief interlude of [[harmattan]] occasioned by the northeast trade wind, with the main feature of [[Haze|dust haze]] and cloudless skies.{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=nomadseason.com |url=https://nomadseason.com/climate/nigeria/fct/abuja.html |access-date=11 February 2024}}</ref>

The [[Wet season|rainy season]] begins from April and ends in October,<ref>{{cite web|title=Average monthly rainfall and snow in Abuja, Nigeria (millimeter)|url=https://weather-and-climate.com:80/average-monthly-precipitation-Rainfall,abuja,Nigeria|access-date=2022-01-08|website=World Weather & Climate Information}}</ref> when daytime temperatures reach {{convert|28|°C|°F|1}} to {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}} and nighttime lows hover around {{convert|22|°C|°F|1}} to {{convert|23|°C|°F|1}}.<ref name=":0">{{cite web|title=Abuja Climate, Weather By Month, Average Temperature (Nigeria) – Weather Spark|url=https://weatherspark.com/y/55097/Average-Weather-in-Abuja-Nigeria-Year-Round|access-date=2022-01-08|website=weatherspark.com|language=en}}</ref> In the dry season, daytime temperatures can soar as high as {{convert|40|°C|°F|1}} and overnight temperatures can dip to {{convert|20|°C|°F|1}}.

The city's inland location causes the [[diurnal temperature variation]] to be much larger than coastal cities with similar climates such as [[Lagos]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2020}}

Rainfall in the FCT reflects the territory's location on the windward side of the [[Jos Plateau]] and the zone of rising air masses with the city receiving frequent rainfall during the rainy season from April to October every year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.touristlink.com/nigeria/abuja/overview.html |title=Abuja Nigeria Tourist Information |publisher=Touristlink.com |access-date=2013-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324021818/http://www.touristlink.com/nigeria/abuja/overview.html |archive-date=24 March 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
