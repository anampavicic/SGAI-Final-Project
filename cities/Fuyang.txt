It is bordered by [[Henan]] province to the west and the cities of [[Bozhou]] to the northeast, [[Huainan]] to the southeast, and [[Lu'an]] to the south.

Its population was 8,200,264 inhabitants at the [[2020 Chinese census|2020 census]] whom 2,128,538 lived in the built-up (''or metro'') area made of 3 urban districts Yingzhou, Yingdong and Yingquan.

==History==

[[File:Fuyang Museum 2015.jpeg|thumb|Fuyang city museum]]
[[File:Fuyang Museum Shuanggudui Xiahou Zao 1.jpeg|thumb|Tomb of Xiahou Zao (front), now located in Fuyang's local museum]]
[[File:Fuyang Museum Shuanggudui Xiahou Zao 2.jpeg|thumb|Tomb of Xiahou Zao (rear). The site of Xiahou Zao's tomb became known as [[Shuanggudui]]]]

===Early Ruyin===

Starting with the [[Qin dynasty]], the region now called Fuyang was called Ruyin ({{zh|labels=no|t=汝陰}}). Ruyin was classified as part of the [[Nine Provinces|ancient province]] of [[Yuzhou (ancient China)|Yuzhou]]. In the early [[Han dynasty]], Ruyin was ruled by [[Xiahou Ying]] (d. 172 BCE), who fought alongside [[Liu Bang]] against the latter's archrival [[Xiang Yu]] in the [[Chu–Han Contention]] (206–202 BC), and helped Liu Bang establish the Han dynasty. Following the establishment of the Han dynasty, the title conferred upon Xiahou Ying was "Lord of Ruyin" ({{zh|labels=no|t=汝陰侯}}). The second Lord of Ruyin was Xiahou Ying's son, [[Xiahou Zao]] ({{zh|labels=no|c=夏侯灶}}) (d. 165 BCE), whose tomb was later rediscovered in Fuyang in 1977.<ref name="sh_2014">{{citation|last=Shaughnessy|first=Edward L.|year=2014|title=Unearthing the ''Changes'': Recently Discovered Manuscripts of the ''Yi Jing'' (''I Ching'') and Related Texts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YfQYBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA190 |location=New York|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-16184-8}}</ref>

===Shuanggudui===

The site of the second Lord of Ruyin's tomb, called [[Shuanggudui]], was rediscovered in 1977 when Fuyang's municipal airport was undergoing an expansion.<ref name="sh_2014"/> Two tombs were found, although only one contained texts. Much like [[Mawangdui]], important classical Chinese texts were found at Shuanggudui that shed new light on ancient Chinese culture and literature. Texts recorded on [[Bamboo and wooden slips|bamboo strips]] were found at Shuanggudui, including the ''[[Yijing]]'', ''[[Classic of Poetry]]'', ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]'', ''[[Cang Jie Pian]]'' (primer), ''Classic for Physiognomizing Dogs'' ({{zh|labels=no|t=相狗經}}), tables of historical annals, studies of myriad phenomena ({{zh|labels=no|t=萬物}}), a text on [[Xingqi (circulating breath)|''xingqi'']] ({{zh|labels=no|t=行氣}}, circulating breath), and others.<ref name="sh_2014"/>

===Ouyang Xiu===

[[Ouyang Xiu]], one of famous [[Eight Masters of the Tang and Song]], died in 1072 in present-day Fuyang, Anhui. His influence was so great, even opponents like [[Wang Anshi]] wrote moving tributes on his behalf. Wang referred to him as the greatest literary figure of his age.

===Red Turban Rebellion===

In the fourteenth century, [[Han Shantong]] sought to overthrow the ruling [[Mongol]] [[Yuan dynasty]]. Han styled himself as the "Great King of Light," claiming to be an incarnation of [[Maitreya|Maitreya Bodhisattva]], and heir to the preceding [[Song dynasty]].<ref name="crimson_rain_p50">Rowe, William. ''Crimson Rain: Seven Centuries of Violence in a Chinese County.'' 2006. p. 50</ref> Han was a native of Yingzhou, where he began the main thrust of the [[Red Turban Rebellion]] in 1351, initially gaining the support of 3000 rebels, and later 10,000.<ref name="crimson_rain_p50"/> After entering [[Shandong]] province, the Red Turban Army merged with other rebel movements, eventually leading indirectly to the founding of the [[Ming dynasty]].

===Great Leap Forward===

[[File:195104 1950年11月治淮委员会副主任曾希圣.png|thumb|Anhui province Party secretary Zeng Xisheng ({{zh|labels=no|s=曾希圣}}) in 1950]]

According to Chinese government reports in the Fuyang Party History Research Office, between the years 1959 and 1961, 2.4 million people from Fuyang died from [[famine]].<ref name="forgotten">Zhou Xun. ''Forgotten Voices of Mao's Great Famine, 1958-1962: An Oral History.'' 2013. pp. 138-139, 292</ref> Before the famines, in 1958, the population of Fuyang had been 8 million people.<ref name="forgotten"/> During this period, [[Zeng Xisheng]], the provincial Party secretary of Anhui, pursued large water conservation projects that led to insufficient [[irrigation]] for local crops, leading to mass [[starvation]].<ref name="forgotten"/> Local cadres, fearing repercussions from Zeng, underreported death rates in their regions, in some cases forcing the starving villagers to hide if there was an official inspection.<ref name="forgotten"/> When [[Vice Chairman of the People's Republic of China|Vice Chairman]] [[Dong Biwu]] came to visit the Fuyang region, provincial leaders ordered all corpses to be removed from Dong's travel route, and for [[edema]] patients to be rounded up and kept out of sight.<ref name="tombstone">Yang, Jisheng, Edward Friedman, Jian Guo, and Stacy Mosher. ''Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962.'' New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2012. Print. p. 312</ref>

Since the 1980s there has been greater official Chinese recognition of the importance of policy mistakes in causing the disaster, and the Party has acknowledged that the disaster was caused mainly by gross mismanagement, using the expression, "Three parts [[natural disaster]] and seven parts [[Anthropogenic hazard|man-made disaster]]."<ref>Yang, Jisheng, Edward Friedman, Jian Guo, and Stacy Mosher. ''Tombstone: The Great Chinese Famine, 1958-1962.'' New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2012. Print. pp. 452-3</ref>

===Blood selling===

In the 1990s, commercial [[blood donation|blood selling]] schemes led to entire villages in Henan and Anhui being infected with the [[HIV]] virus. The government in Fuyang, which at that time was headed by Wang Huaizhong ({{zh|labels=no|s=王怀忠}}), encouraged rural villagers to sell blood as a way to supplement their income.<ref name="deep_china_88_89">Kleinman, Arthur. Yunxiang Yan. Jing Jun. Sing Lee. Everett Zhang. ''Deep China: The Moral Life of the Person.'' 2011. pp. 88-89</ref> The blood collectors would often draw too much blood, causing their feet to go [[numbness|numb]], and sometimes people were even hung upside down against a wall to force blood to flow back into their arms.<ref name="deep_china_88_89"/>

As compensation for giving their blood, participants were given 50 yuan along with some food and drink.<ref name="deep_china_88_89"/> Many people engaged in this practice due to rural poverty and local corruption, which placed them under great economic stress. As one woman from Fuyang recalls:<ref name="deep_china_88_89"/>

{{quote|We sold blood because we were poor. Wang Huaizhong was in power at that time and the government under him demanded that each farmer pay an extra agricultural tax. If you failed to pay, the officials would take away your pigs, corn, and grain. So the harvest was only good enough for a basic living. But keeping children at school was expensive. [[Bribery|Giving out gifts every year]] cost a family nearly ten thousand yuan. [[Bride price|Building rooms to bring in a wife]] cost thirty thousand to forty thousand yuan. But if the government did not encourage blood selling, we would not have sold blood to make money.}}

In a 2004 epidemiological survey of Fuyang, it was found that at least three thousand farmers had contracted HIV due to the blood trade.<ref name="deep_china_88_89"/>

The Fuyang [[AIDS]] [[Orphan]] Salvation Association ({{zh|labels=no|s=阜阳市艾滋病贫困儿童救助协会}}) has done some relief work to help [[AIDS orphan]]s in Fuyang.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.chinahumanrights.org/Messages/feature/33/t20091203_600508.htm|title=Orphanage workers ease the plight of China's AIDS children|publisher=China Human Rights}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/social-and-human-sciences/themes/fight-against-discrimination/education-of-children-in-need/projects-by-region/asia-and-the-pacific/china-aids-orphans-salvation-association-of-fuyang-aos/|title=China - Aids Orphans Salvation Association of Fuyang (AOS)|publisher=UNESCO}}</ref> The 2006 short film, ''[[The Blood of Yingzhou District]]'', documents the many challenges faced by AIDS orphans living in rural parts of Fuyang's Yingzhou district.

Wang Huaizhong, who promoted blood selling in Fuyang in the early 1990s, was later promoted to deputy governor of Anhui province.<ref name="deep_china_88_89"/> However, in 2001, he was arrested for taking bribes.<ref name="wang_huaizhong_20031230">{{cite web| url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-12/30/content_294409.htm| title=Anhui vice-governor gets death penalty| publisher=China Daily| date=2003-12-30| access-date=2015-07-10}}</ref> He was later convicted of accepting bribes totaling 5.17 million yuan, and having 4.8 million yuan of unaccountable assets. After being taken into custody, Wang attempted to bribe investigators into dropping the investigation, and continued to seek bribes from private business owners. In response, the court [[death sentence|sentenced him to death]], stating, "His attitude was disgusting and he was severely punished in accordance with the law."<ref name="wang_huaizhong_20031230"/> In February 2004, just two months after his trial, Wang was executed by [[lethal injection]].<ref name="wang_huaizhong_20040212">{{cite web| url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-02/12/content_305512.htm| title=Corrupt official executed for bribery| publisher=China Daily| date=2004-02-12| access-date=2015-07-10}}</ref>

Wang Huaizhong had previously pursued the construction of [[Fuyang Xiguan Airport|a large airport in Fuyang]] that was widely regarded as a [[boondoggle]], costing 390 million yuan, but which served only 920 passengers in 2002.<ref name="wang_huaizhong_theage">{{cite web| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/12/30/1072546484445.html |title=Former provincial vice-governor sentenced to death| publisher=The Age| date=2003-12-30| access-date=2015-07-10}}</ref>

===Recent events===
[[File:Anhui Fuyang Yingquan White House.jpeg|thumb|Fuyang's "White House" in [[Yingquan District]]]]

In 2004, there was a food scandal involving fake [[infant formula]] being sold in Fuyang. Chinese state media reported that 50–60 children in Fuyang died from the formula, with the children belonging mostly to poor rural families.<ref name="cbs_may">{{cite web| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/arrests-in-fake-baby-formula-case/| title=Arrests In Fake Baby Formula Case| author=Francie Grace| work=CBS News| date=2004-05-10}}</ref> Fuyang's mayor Liu Qingqiang was reprimanded by the [[Chinese Communist Party]] for failing to supervise food safety, while Vice Mayor Ma Mingyue was forced to resign.<ref name="cbs_june">{{cite web| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/fake-milk-powder-causes-baby-death/| title=Fake Milk Powder Causes Baby Death| author=Raksha Shetty| work=CBS News| date=2004-06-09}}</ref> Subsequently, 55 brands of cheap infant formula were banned after it was discovered they had only traces of the required nutrients.<ref name="cbs_june"/>

In early 2007, Chinese state media began reporting that in Yingquan District, a government building dubbed the "White House" was becoming controversial. The construction cost of the "White House" was reported to have reached 30 million yuan, nearly one third of the 100 million yuan annual fiscal income of the entire Yingquan district.<ref name="chinadaily_20070124">{{cite web| url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2007-01/24/content_790745.htm| title=Local officials need oversight| publisher=China Daily| date=2007-01-24}}</ref> Despite being popularly deemed the "White House" ({{lang|zh-hans|白宫}}), the building resembles the [[United States Capitol]].

In 2008, it was widely reported that [[Zhang Zhi'an]] ({{lang|zh-hans|张治安}}), the Communist Party chief of Yingquan District, nicknamed the "White House Party Chief," had been suspended from his office on June 5, 2008, along several other officials.<ref name="chinadaily_20080623">{{cite web| url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-06/23/content_6787145.htm| title=Officials investigated over petitioner's death in prison| date=2008-06-23| publisher=China Daily (Xinhua)}}</ref> They were under investigation for the death of [[Li Guofu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|李国福}}), a businessman who acted as a [[whistleblower]].

==Climate==
Fuyang features a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cwa'') with cool, damp winters and very hot and wet summers. Because the weather is perceived as frequently changing, a common saying among local people is that, "Fuyang has four seasons in [[Spring (season)|spring]]."
