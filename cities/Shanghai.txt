The city is located on the Chinese shoreline on the southern [[estuary]] of the [[Yangtze River]], with the [[Huangpu River]] flowing through it.

The population of the city proper is the [[List of largest cities|third largest in the world]], with around 24.87 million inhabitants in 2023, while the urban area is the [[List of cities in China by population|most populous in China]], with 29.87 million residents. As of 2022, the Greater Shanghai metropolitan area was estimated to produce a [[gross metropolitan product]] ([[GDP (nominal)|nominal]]) of nearly 13 trillion [[Renminbi|RMB]] ($1.9 trillion).<ref name="GDP2022" /> Shanghai is one of the world's major centers for finance, [[#Economy|business and economics]], research, science and technology, manufacturing, transportation, [[List of tourist attractions in Shanghai|tourism]], and [[Culture of Shanghai|culture]].

Originally a fishing village and market town, Shanghai grew in importance in the 19th century due to both domestic and foreign trade and its favorable port location. The city was one of five [[treaty ports]] forced to open to European trade after the [[First Opium War]], which ceded [[Hong Kong]] to the [[United Kingdom]] until it was handed over back to [[Handover of Hong Kong|China]] on 1 July 1997. This followed the [[Second Battle of Chuenpi]] in 1841, more than 60&nbsp;km (37&nbsp;mi) east of the Portuguese colony of [[Macau]]. Macau was controlled by [[Portugal]] following the [[Luso-Chinese agreement]] of 1554 until the [[Handover of Macau|handover]] of the [[Millennium]] on 20 December 1999. The [[Shanghai International Settlement]] and the [[Shanghai French Concession|French Concession]] were subsequently established. The city then flourished, becoming a primary commercial and financial hub of Asia in the 1930s. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], the city was the site of the major [[Battle of Shanghai]]. After the war, the [[Chinese Civil War]] soon resumed between the [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) and the [[Chinese Communist Party]] (CCP), with the latter eventually [[Shanghai Campaign|taking over the city]] and most of the mainland. From the 1950s to the 1970s, trade was mostly limited to other socialist countries in the [[Eastern Bloc]], causing the city's global influence to decline during the [[Cold War]].

Major changes of fortune for the city would occur when [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms]] initiated by paramount leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] during the 1980s resulted in an intense redevelopment and revitalization of the city by the 1990s, especially the [[Pudong]] New Area, aiding the return of finance and foreign investment. The city has since re-emerged as a hub for international trade and finance. It is the home of the [[Shanghai Stock Exchange]], [[List of major stock exchanges|the largest stock exchanges in the Asia-Pacific]] by market capitalization and the [[Shanghai Free-Trade Zone]], the first [[free-trade zone]] in mainland China. Shanghai has been classified as an Alpha+ ([[Global city|global first-tier]]) city by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]]. As of 2024, it is home to 13 companies of the [[Fortune Global 500#Fortune Global 500 of 2021|''Fortune'' Global 500]] and is ranked 4th on the [[Global Financial Centres Index]]. The city is also a global major center for [[List of cities by scientific output|research and development]] and home to numerous [[Double First-Class Construction|Double First-Class Universities]], including [[Fudan University]] and [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University|Shanghai Jiaotong University]]. The [[Shanghai Metro]], first opened in 1993, is the [[List of metro systems|largest metro network]] in the world by route length.

Shanghai has been described as the "showpiece" of the [[economy of China]]. Featuring several architectural styles such as [[Art Deco]] and [[shikumen]], the city is renowned for its [[Lujiazui]] skyline, museums and historic buildings including the [[City God Temple of Shanghai|City God Temple]], [[Yu Garden]], the [[China Pavilion]] and buildings along [[the Bund]]. The [[Oriental Pearl Tower]] can be seen from the Bund. Shanghai is also known for its [[Shanghai cuisine|cuisine]], [[Shanghainese|local language]], and cosmopolitan culture, ranks sixth in the [[list of cities with the most skyscrapers]], and it is one of the biggest economic hubs in the world.

}} The two [[Chinese character]]s in the city's name are {{zh|c={{linktext|上}} |labels=no}} ({{transliteration|zh|shàng}}/''zaon'', "upon") and {{zh|c={{linktext|海}} |labels=no}} ({{transliteration|zh|hǎi}}/''hé'', "sea"), together meaning "On the Sea." The earliest occurrence of this name dates from the 11th-century [[Song dynasty]], when there was already a river confluence and a town with this name in the area. Others contend that the city is referenced in historical records dating back 2150 years, and that its ancient name, "Hu", suggests it was previously a fishing village. In 1280 it was renamed "Shanghai", which translates to "Above the Sea".<ref>{{cite book|last=Choy Chong |first=Li|year=1998|title=Business Environment and Opportunities in China: Shanghai and its Surrounding Region|publisher=Deutscher Universitätsverlag|page=4|isbn=978-3824404131}}</ref> How the name should be understood has been disputed, but Chinese historians have concluded that during the [[Tang dynasty]], the area of modern-day Shanghai was under sea level, so the land appeared to be literally "on the sea."<ref name="Danielson, Eric N. 2004, pp.8-9">Danielson, Eric N., ''Shanghai and the Yangzi Delta'', 2004, pp.&nbsp;8–9.</ref>

===Imperial era===

==== Tang, Song, Yuan dynasties ====
During the Tang and Song dynasties, Qinglong Town ({{lang|zh-Hans|青龙镇}}{{Efn|{{zh|t=青龍鎮}}|name=|group=}}) in modern [[Qingpu District]] was a major trading port. Established in 746 (the fifth year of the Tang [[Tianbao era]]), it developed into what was historically called a "giant town of the Southeast," with thirteen temples and seven pagodas. [[Mi Fu]], a scholar and artist of the Song dynasty, served as its mayor. The port experienced thriving trade with provinces along the [[Yangtze]] and the Chinese coast, as well as with foreign countries such as Japan and [[Silla]].<ref name=kaogu>{{cite web |url = http://www.kaogu.cn/zixun/zixun/shidafaxain/2017/0324/57570.html |script-title=zh:上海青浦青龙镇遗址 |trans-title=Ruins of Qinglong Town in Qingpu, Shanghai |publisher=[[Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] |date=24 March 2017 |access-date=16 July 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170831221826/http://www.kaogu.cn/zixun/zixun/shidafaxain/2017/0324/57570.html |archive-date=31 August 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> By the end of the [[Song dynasty]], the center of trading had moved downstream of the [[Wusong River]] to Shanghai.<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.thepaper.cn/baidu.jsp?contid=1577571 |script-title=zh:青龙镇考古：上海首个贸易港，为何人称"小杭州" |publisher=Thepaper.cn |date=10 December 2016 |access-date=16 July 2017 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170911071123/http://www.thepaper.cn/baidu.jsp?contid=1577571 |archive-date=11 September 2017 |url-status=live}}</ref> It was upgraded in status from a village to a market town in 1074, and in 1172, a second sea wall was built to stabilize the ocean coastline, supplementing an earlier dike.<ref>Danielson, Eric N., Shanghai and the [[Yangzi Delta]], 2004, p.9.</ref> From the [[Yuan dynasty]] in 1292 until Shanghai officially became a [[municipality]] in 1927, central Shanghai was administered as a county under Songjiang Prefecture, which had its seat in the present-day [[Songjiang District]].<ref>Danielson, Eric N., Shanghai and the Yangzi Delta, 2004, p.9, pp.11–12, p.34.</ref>

==== Ming dynasty ====
[[File:Map of the Old City of Shanghai.jpg|thumb|Seventeenth century map of the Old City of Shanghai]]
Two important events helped promote Shanghai's developments in the [[Ming dynasty]]. A [[city wall]] was built for the first time in 1554 to protect the town from raids by [[Wokou|Japanese pirates]]. It measured {{convert|10|m|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} high and {{convert|5|km|0|sp=us|abbr=on}} in circumference.<ref name="Danielson, Eric N. 2004, p.10">Danielson, Eric N., Shanghai and the Yangzi Delta, 2004, p.10.</ref> A [[City God Temple of Shanghai|City God Temple]] was built in 1602 during the [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] reign. This honor was usually reserved for prefectural capitals and not normally given to a mere county seat such as Shanghai. Scholars have theorized that this likely reflected the town's economic importance, as opposed to its low political status.<ref name="Danielson, Eric N. 2004, p.10" />

==== Qing dynasty ====
During the [[Qing dynasty]], Shanghai became one of the most important seaports in the [[Yangtze Delta]] region as a result of two important central government policy changes: in 1684, the [[Kangxi Emperor]] reversed the Ming dynasty prohibition on oceangoing vessels—a ban that had been in force since 1525; and in 1732, the [[Qianlong Emperor]] moved the customs office for [[Jiangsu]] province ({{linktext|lang=zh-Hans|江|海|关}};{{Efn|{{zh|t=江海關}}|name=|group=}} see [[Customs House, Shanghai]]) from the prefectural capital of [[Songjiang, Shanghai|Songjiang]] to Shanghai, and gave Shanghai exclusive control over customs collections for Jiangsu's foreign trade. As a result of these two critical decisions, Shanghai became the major trade port for all of the lower Yangtze region by 1735, despite still being at the lowest administrative level in the political hierarchy.<ref>Danielson, Eric N., Shanghai and the Yangtze Delta, 2004, pp.10–11.</ref>

A side-effect of the Japanese invasion of Shanghai was the [[Shanghai Ghetto]]. Japanese consul to [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]], [[Chiune Sugihara]] issued thousands of visas to Jewish refugees who were escaping the Nazi's [[Final Solution to the Jewish Question]]. They traveled from [[Keidan]], Lithuania across Russia by railroad to the [[Vladivostok]] from where they traveled by ship to [[Kobe, Japan]]. Their stay in Kobe was short as the Japanese government transferred them to Shanghai by November 1941. Other Jewish refugees found haven in Shanghai, not through Sugihara, but came on ships from Italy. The refugees from Europe were interned into a cramped ghetto in the Hongkou District and after the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], even the Iraqi Jews who had been living in Shanghai from before the outbreak of WWII were interned. Among the refugees in the Shanghai Ghetto was the [[Mir yeshiva (Belarus)|Mirrer Yeshiva]], including its students and faculty. On 3 September 1945, the Chinese Army liberated the Ghetto and most of the Jews left over the next few years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/11/shanghais-forgotten-jewish-past/281713/ |title=Shanghai's Forgotten Jewish Past |last=Griffiths |first=James |work=The Atlantic |date=21 December 2013 |access-date=30 June 2021 |archive-date=20 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620014031/https://www.theatlantic.com/china/archive/2013/11/shanghais-forgotten-jewish-past/281713/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Some of Shanghai's buildings feature [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] neoclassical architecture or [[Stalinist architecture]], though the city has fewer such structures than Beijing. These buildings were mostly erected between the founding of the [[People's Republic of China|People's Republic]] in 1949 and the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] in the late 1960s. During this time period, large numbers of Soviet experts, including architects, poured into China to aid the country in the construction of a communist state. An example of Soviet neoclassical architecture in Shanghai is the modern-day [[Shanghai Exhibition Center]].<ref name="Lonely Planet - undated - Lonely Planet review for Shanghai Exhibition Center">{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/shanghai/sights/building/shanghai-exhibition-centre|title=Lonely Planet review for Shanghai Exhibition Centre|work=[[Lonely Planet]]|access-date=14 June 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113175246/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/china/shanghai/sights/building/shanghai-exhibition-centre|archive-date=13 November 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

Although currently making up a fraction of the religious population in Shanghai, Jewish people have played an influential role in the city's history. After the [[Treaty of Nanking]] ended the [[First Opium War]] in 1842, the city was opened up to western populations and merchants traveled to Shanghai for its rich business potential, including many prominent Jewish families. The [[Sassoon family|Sassoon]]s amassed great wealth in the opium and textile trades, cementing their status by funding many of the buildings that have become iconic in Shanghai's skyline, such as the Cathay Hotel in 1929.<ref name="ShanghaiJews">{{cite web |url=https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/travel/holidays/the-jews-of-shanghai-china-1.494295 |title=The Jews of Shanghai |work=The JC |last=Parker |first=Rupert |date=15 December 2019 |access-date=30 June 2021 |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210506125801/https://www.thejc.com/lifestyle/travel/holidays/the-jews-of-shanghai-china-1.494295}}</ref> The [[Hardoon]]s were another prominent Baghdadi Jewish family that used their business success to define Shanghai in the 20th century.

The [[vernacular]] language spoken in the city is Shanghainese, part of the [[Taihu Wu]] subgroup of the [[Wu Chinese]] language family.

Prior to its expansion, the language spoken in Shanghai was not as prominent as those spoken around [[Jiaxing]] and later [[Suzhou]],<ref name="CZMShanghainese" /> and was known as "the local tongue" ({{lang|zh-Hans|本地閑話}}), a name which is now used in suburbs only.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.shobserver.com/news/detail?id=110722|script-title=zh:“上海闲话”和“本地闲话”为何差别这么大?|work=Shanghai Observer|last=You|first=Rujie|date=16 October 2018|access-date=25 October 2019|archive-date=11 April 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220411210922/https://www.shobserver.com/news/detail?id=110722|url-status=live}}</ref> In the late 19th century, downtown Shanghainese ({{lang|zh-Hans|市區閑話}} or simply {{lang|zh-Hans|上海閑話}}) appeared, undergoing rapid changes and quickly replacing Suzhounese as the [[prestige dialect]] of the [[Yangtze River Delta]] region. At the time, most of the immigration into the city came from the two adjacent provinces, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the local dialects of which had the greatest influence on Shanghainese. After 1949, Putonghua (Standard Mandarin) has also had a great impact on Shanghainese as a result of being rigorously promoted by the government.<ref name="CZMShanghainese" /> Since the 1990s, many migrants outside of the Wu-speaking region have come to Shanghai for education and jobs. They often cannot speak the local language and therefore use Putonghua (Mandarin) as a [[lingua franca]]. Because Putonghua and English were more favored, Shanghainese began to decline, and fluency among young speakers weakened. In recent years, there have been movements within the city to promote the local language and protect it from fading out.<ref>{{cite news|title=Is Shanghai's local dialect, and culture, in crisis?|author=Zat Liu|url=http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/life/shanghaihua-crisis-680262|newspaper=CNN GO|date=20 August 2010|access-date=5 June 2011|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903072555/http://www.cnngo.com/shanghai/life/shanghaihua-crisis-680262|archive-date=3 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Stopping the local dialect becoming derelict|author=Jia Feishang|url=http://www.shanghaidaily.com/feature/art-and-culture/Stopping-the-local-dialect-becoming-derelict/shdaily.shtml|newspaper=[[Shanghai Daily]]|date=13 May 2011|access-date=11 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170212091106/http://www.shanghaidaily.com/feature/art-and-culture/Stopping-the-local-dialect-becoming-derelict/shdaily.shtml|archive-date=12 February 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Shanghai Cricket Club]] dates back to 1858 when the first recorded cricket match was played between a team of [[Royal Navy|British Naval]] officers and a Shanghai 11. Following a 45-year dormancy after the founding of the PRC in 1949, the club was re-established in 1994 by expatriates living in the city and has since grown to over 300 members. The [[Shanghai cricket team]] played various international matches between 1866 and 1948. With cricket in the rest of China almost non-existent, for that period they were the de facto [[China national cricket team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shanghaicricket.com/about-us/|title=About the Shanghai Cricket Club|publisher=Shanghai Cricket Club|access-date=23 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190411205407/http://shanghaicricket.com/about-us/|archive-date=11 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>
