'''Hafar al-Batin''' ({{langx|ar|حفر الباطن}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ḥafar al-Bāṭin}}''), also frequently spelled ''Hafr al-Batin'', is a city in the Hafar al-Batin Governorate, [[Eastern Province, Saudi Arabia|Eastern Province]], [[Saudi Arabia]]. It is located 430&nbsp;km north of [[Riyadh]], 94.2&nbsp;km from the [[Kuwait]] border, and about 74.3 from the [[Iraq]] border.  The city lies in the dry valley of the [[Wadi al-Batin]], which is part of the longer valley of the river [[Wadi al-Rummah]] (now dry), which leads inland toward [[Medina]] and formerly emptied into the [[Persian Gulf]].

==History==

=== water issue === 
The name of Hafar al-Batin ({{langx|ar|حفر الباطن}}, "the inner hole") is derived from its location; the water hole in the desert.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}.

In the 1st Islamic century [[Islamic Calendar|after hijrah]] or 638 CE, Hafar al-Batin was just a highway oasis in the desert that [[Muslim|pilgrims]] passed while traveling to [[Mecca]] for [[Hajj]]. It falls on the route from Asia towards the Red Sea. It's an ancient desert trail that delivered silk and metals coming from China towards [[Mecca]] and [[Jeddah]]. The new formed Muslim Caliphate moved in immediately and gained hold of the area.
At the time of Islam's arrival, there was little water available in the area, so the pilgrims travelled from [[Iraq]] to Mecca on a long route without much water. 
During the reign of [[Uthman ibn Affan|Uthman]] (644 - 656 CE), many pilgrims complained about the lack of water, and [[Abu-Musa al-Asha'ari]], a [[Sahabah|companion of the Islamic prophet Muhammad]] was placed in charge of the area and responded by digging new wells along the route. He ended up leaving a heavy impact on the oasis which eventually turned it into a desert stop. His descendants also resided in the area afterwards in which became a small town.

==Ancient importance==
Haffar al-batin is an ancient home to many nomadic Arab inhabitants. Although it lacked water on an industrial level, it had its own strategic feature.
Keeping this region dry was a critical move by the Arabs to prevent foreign armies, especially the Persians, from entering the inner derest. It was a natural barrier to foreign threats. The Arabs had camels and guides; others didn't which kept it safe for traveling Arabs and bedouins. Striking oil while digging wells is common in this region and the local Arabs knew the water ways; others didn't. This is what stopped [[Hulegu Khan]]'s army from advancing towards [[Mecca]] in the 1200's. Due to its tough climate, his expeditionary officers reasoned that it was impossible for the 300 thousand  man army to go south of [[Basra]], thus they had to go north hoping to go around the [[Fertile Crescent]] which turned out to be quagmire on the long run. 

=== Recent history ===

The Suhail Arab clan make up some of Haffar al-batin population along with many other Sunni Arabs such as Anizah and Shammar.
The region was part of Kuwait before the Uqair Protocol of 1922 in which it was given to Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{cite web |website=opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com |url=https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/01/put-it-in-neutral/|title=Put It in Neutral|date=May 2012}}</ref>
The [[Ministry of Housing (Saudi Arabia)|Saudi Arabia Ministry of Housing]] announced in August 2020 that they would be including Hafr Al Batin in its program to increase residential ownership by its citizens. The ministry will be providing 759 plots in Hafr Al Batin alone.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Saudi's Sakani launches 5 housing plans to provide 2,009 plots of land|url=https://www.constructionweekonline.com/projects-and-tenders/266605-saudis-sakani-launches-5-housing-plans-to-provide-2009-plots-of-land|access-date=2020-09-10|website=Construction Week Online Middle East|language=en}}</ref>
