'''Elgin''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|l|dʒ|ᵻ|n}} {{respell|EL|jin}}) is a city in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook]] and [[Kane County, Illinois|Kane]] counties in the U.S. state of [[Illinois]]. It is located {{convert|35|mi|km|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Chicago]] along the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]]. As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the city had a population of 114,797, making it the [[List of municipalities in Illinois|sixth-most populous city]] in the state.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Elgin city, Illinois|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=1600000US1723074|website=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=April 15, 2022}}</ref>

==History==
{{Further|Spring-Douglas Historic District}}
The [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830 and the [[Black Hawk War|Black Hawk Indian War of 1832]] led to the expulsion of the [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] who had settlements and [[Mound builder (people)|burial mounds]] in the area and set the stage for the founding of Elgin. Thousands of [[militia]]men and soldiers of [[Winfield Scott|Gen. Winfield Scott]]'s army marched through the [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]] valley during the war, and accounts of the area's fertile soils and flowing springs soon filtered east.

In New York, James T. Gifford and his brother Hezekiah Gifford heard tales of this area ripe for settlement, and they traveled west. Looking for a site on the stagecoach route from [[Chicago]] to [[Galena, Illinois]], they eventually settled on a spot where the Fox River could be bridged. In April 1835, they established the city, naming<ref>{{cite book |last=Alft |first=E.C. |title=Elgin: An American History |year=1984 |publisher=Crossroads Communications, Ashton, IL |isbn=0-916445-09-7 |url=http://www.elginhistory.com/eaah/ |access-date=October 26, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910042531/http://www.elginhistory.com/eaah/ |archive-date=September 10, 2013 |url-status=live }}</ref> it after the [[Scotland|Scottish]] tune "Elgin".<ref>{{cite book| title=The Congregational Hymn and Tune Book| year=1856| publisher=General Association of Connecticut| page=120| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hGKYVucXEjIC&q=Elgin&pg=PA120| access-date=November 20, 2015| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160208225425/https://books.google.com/books?id=hGKYVucXEjIC&lpg=PA434&ots=6cKBUe4rwb&dq=Elgin&pg=PA120| archive-date=February 8, 2016| url-status=live}}</ref>

Early Elgin achieved fame for the butter and dairy goods it sold to the city of Chicago. [[Gail Borden]] established a [[condensed milk]] factory here in 1866, and [[Gail Borden Public Library District|the local library]] was named in his honor. The dairy industry became less important with the arrival of the [[Elgin Watch Company]]. The watch factory employed three generations of Elginites from the late 19th century to the mid-20th century, when it was the largest producer of fine [[watch]]es in the United States (the factory ceased production in 1965 and was torn down in the summer of 1966) and the operator of the largest [[watchmaking]] complex in the world.<ref>{{cite book|author=Aft, E.C.|title=''Elgin: An American History''|publisher=ElginHistory.com|date=2000|url=http://www.elginhistory.com/eaah/|access-date=September 16, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130910042531/http://www.elginhistory.com/eaah/|archive-date=September 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> Today, the clocks at Chicago's [[Chicago Union Station|Union Station]] still bear the Elgin name.<ref name="elginhistory.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.elginhistory.com/dgb/ |title=Elgin: Days Gone By by E.

From 1910 until 1920, with the exception of the World War I years, the city hosted the [[Elgin National Road Races]], which attracted the top national racing champions as well as many of the major automobile manufacturers.<ref name="Elgin Road Races">{{cite web |url=https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=55454 |title=Elgin Road Races |publisher=The Historical Marker Database |access-date=25 January 2024}}</ref><ref name="Elgin Road Race">{{cite web |url=https://elginhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Elgin-Road-Race.pdf |title=Elgin Road Race |publisher=elginhistory.org |access-date=25 January 2024}}</ref> The races were sponsored by the Elgin Watch Company who offered a $1,000 prize and a silver trophy to the winner.<ref name="Elgin Road Race"/> The races contributed significantly to the development of the modern automobile.<ref name="Elgin Road Races"/>

Elgin has a long tradition of education and invention. Elgin is home to the [[Elgin Academy (Elgin, Illinois)|Elgin Academy]], the oldest coeducational, non-sectarian [[college preparatory school]] west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]]. [[Elgin High School (Illinois)|Elgin High School]] boasts five Navy admirals, a Nobel Prize winner, a Pulitzer Prize winner, a Tony Award winner, two Academy Award-winning producers, Olympic athletes and a [[General Motors]] CEO among its alumni. Elgin resident John Murphy invented the motorized [[streetsweeper]] in 1914 and later formed the Elgin Sweeper Corporation. Pioneering [[African-American]] chemist [[Lloyd Hall]] was an Elgin native, as was the legendary marketer and car stereo pioneer [[Madman Muntz|Earl "Madman" Muntz]]; and [[Max Adler (Sears)|Max Adler]], founder of the [[Adler Planetarium]] in Chicago, America's first planetarium.<ref name="elginhistory.com"/>

In the 1990s, Elgin became one of the few cities in northern Illinois to host a [[riverboat]] [[casino]]. The [[Grand Victoria Casino Elgin|Grand Victoria Casino]] initially generated controversy, but went on to be a significant source of income for the city. Drawing nearly four million people annually, as of March 2005 it was the fifth most popular tourist attraction in Illinois. The [[Grand Victoria Foundation]], to which the casino had contributed an amount in excess of $116 million, provides community grants to nonprofits in the city. In the years since, more casinos have opened in the area and the Grand Victoria Casino had seen attendance and revenue decline.

In 2013, Elgin ranked number one in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] in new home starts while ranking second in new home closings.<ref name="Home Starts">{{cite web |url=http://www.crown-highlandwoods.com/elgin-housing-market-shows-strength-in-2013-numbers/ |title=Elgin Housing Market Shows Strength in 2013 Numbers |date=February 18, 2014 |publisher=Crown-highlandwoods.com |access-date=March 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402155953/http://www.crown-highlandwoods.com/elgin-housing-market-shows-strength-in-2013-numbers/ |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> Elgin's downtown has also been the center of city renovations and new developments. New townhouses, condo towers, loft spaces, and art galleries have opened in the last decade. In October 2003 the [[Gail Borden Public Library District|Gail Borden Public Library]] moved into a new $30 million, 139,980 square foot, 460,000 volume-capacity building, and in August 2009 opened its first-ever satellite branch.

Elgin is home to the [[Elgin Symphony Orchestra]]. Other classical music groups include the [[Elgin Youth Symphony Orchestra]], the Elgin Master Chorale, and the Elgin Children's Chorus. Outdoor music can be heard at the Wing Park Bandshell. Theatre groups include the Janus Theatre Company, Elgin Theatre Company, the Independent Players, Children's Theatre of Elgin, Fox Valley Youth Theatre, and Nothing Special Productions. Together, [[The Hemmens Cultural Center]] and [[Elgin Community College]]'s Visual & Performing Arts Center host dozens of performances a year by performers ranging from Chicago's Hubbard Street Dance Company to comedian [[Bill Maher]].

After losing many landmark businesses in the 1980s, downtown Elgin experienced a renaissance in the 1990s with the arrival of the [[Grand Victoria Casino Elgin|Grand Victoria riverboat casino]] and improvement in the local economy. Many historic buildings have been transformed into stylish clubs and restaurants.

===Architecture===
[[File:ElginStateHosp.jpg|thumb|right|Historic print of Main Building of [[Elgin State Hospital]], demolished in 1993]]
The city was known for its historic architecture and landmarks from the [[Victorian era]], including some fine examples of homes in the [[Queen Anne style architecture in the United States|Queen Anne style]]. Many of the most remarkable homes once belonged to National Watch Company executives. Many interesting [[Sears Catalog Home]]s arrived in Elgin as kits from 1908 to 1940.  The [[Elgin Tower Building]] and the [[Elgin Professional Building]] are two large towers constructed in Elgin's heyday, before the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. The Tower Building was recently renovated, converting it to residential apartments.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.elgintower.com/|title=elgintower.com|website=www.elgintower.com|access-date=December 6, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715070524/http://elgintower.com/|archive-date=July 15, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Predating Victorian homes were homes made of native [[cobblestone]]. It was believed that Elgin had at one time the largest concentration of cobblestone homes outside of [[Rochester, New York]]. Several such homes built by the earliest settlers still stand. They can be seen in Elgin's historic districts, two of which are recognized by the [[National Register of Historic Places]].

The [[Elgin Public Museum]] at Lords Park was the oldest building in Illinois built expressly as a museum that was still serving that purpose.

Open Elgin is a free, self guided tour of downtown Elgin's architecture. Each April, over two dozen buildings are accessible on the tour, though the event has been postponed due to the ongoing [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Home Open Elgin|url=https://www.openelgin.com/|access-date=December 10, 2020|website=Open Elgin|language=en-US}}</ref>

The nine-member Elgin Heritage Commission promotes [[historic preservation]] activity. The Gifford Park Association was also active in historic preservation, and conducts a popular annual house tour.

==Parks and recreation==
Elgin's city parks include {{convert|112|acre|adj=on}} Lords Park, which features the [[Elgin Public Museum]] and a small zoo featuring a herd of [[American bison]], and {{convert|121|acre|adj=on}} Wing Park, which includes a [[Wing Park Golf Course|golf course]] and outdoor swimming pool. Other golf courses within Elgin include the Highlands of Elgin, the Elgin Country Club, and Bowes Creek Country Club. The Centre of Elgin, which among other features includes an aquatic park and a [[climbing wall]], remains one of the largest municipal recreation centers in the United States. The Elgin Sports Complex on the city's southwest side offers ten lighted ballfields, ten soccer fields and The Hill BMX track. The complex hosts several local, regional and national tournaments every year. Elgin connects to [[Algonquin, Illinois|Algonquin]] and [[East Dundee, Illinois|Dundee]] to the north, and [[St. Charles, Illinois|St. Charles]], [[Geneva, Illinois|Geneva]], and [[Batavia, Illinois|Batavia]] to the south by the Fox River Trail [[Segregated cycle facilities|bike path]].

Although one of the largest and fastest-growing cities in Illinois, Elgin still retains some of the natural habitat diversity that first brought settlers to this area. On the east, the city borders the {{convert|4200|acre|adj=on}} Poplar Creek Preserve, maintained by the [[Forest Preserve District of Cook County|Cook County Forest Preserves]], which includes bike trails, hiking trails and equestrian trails. The Shoe Factory Road Prairie located in the preserve provides an example of the hill prairies that once dotted the region. Poplar Creek Preserves connects to the {{convert|4000|acre|adj=on}} Spring Creek Valley Forest Preserve via a [[conservation easement]] covering parts of the Sears campus.<ref name="Archived copy">{{Cite web |url=https://www.cityofelgin.org/2140/Our-History |title=Our History &#124; City of Elgin, Illinois - Official Website |access-date=April 21, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421224229/https://www.cityofelgin.org/2140/Our-History |archive-date=April 21, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Elgin boasts two highly protected [[nature preserve]]s, the Bluff Spring Fen and Trout Park. For its size, Bluff Spring Fen has a remarkable number of distinct plant communities, including a hill prairie and a [[fen]], or alkaline spring marshland, which is home to several rare [[orchid]]s. Trout Park also includes a similar calcareous seep community, with the addition of a unique forest community of [[oak]]s, [[Fraxinus|ashes]], [[maple]]s, and uncommon species such as [[Thuja|arborvitae]] and [[witch-hazel]]. When the park was created in the 1920s, the local newspaper ran a lengthy front-page story with lists of the plant species of Trout Park, reflecting both the great variety of plants present and the interest Elginites had in conservation. In the 1960s, the [[Northwest Tollway]] bisected the site and reduced it in size.<ref name="Archived copy"/>

In recent years, Elgin has increased its efforts to be more [[environmentally sustainable]]. In 2017, the city introduced free curbside [[textile recycling]] to residents, and it is the first city in Illinois to do so.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://kanecountyconnects.com/2017/07/elgin-is-first-illinois-city-to-offer-simple-curbside-textile-recycling/|title=Elgin Is First Illinois City To Offer Simple Curbside Textile Recycling|date=July 7, 2017|work=Kane County Connects|access-date=October 16, 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016122326/http://kanecountyconnects.com/2017/07/elgin-is-first-illinois-city-to-offer-simple-curbside-textile-recycling/|archive-date=October 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> Additionally, Elgin encourages its residents to compost and use [[rain barrels]], which it sometimes subsidizes for residents to purchase.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofelgin.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=492&ARC=478|title=Elgin|website=Elgin|access-date=October 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016122328/http://www.cityofelgin.org/CivicAlerts.aspx?AID=492&ARC=478|archive-date=October 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> The city also has a proposed Sustainability Action Plan that includes plans for creating renewable sources of energy for the city, a curbside organics/composting pilot-program, and information about community gardens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cityofelgin.org/index.aspx?NID=856|title=City of Elgin, Illinois - Official Website - Sustainability Action Plan|website=www.cityofelgin.org|language=en|access-date=October 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016174124/http://www.cityofelgin.org/index.aspx?NID=856|archive-date=October 16, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Government==
Elgin was chartered as a city by the [[State of Illinois]] in 1854, and 100 years later it became the first city in Illinois to adopt a [[council-manager]] form of government. Residents elect eight at-large council members and a mayor, who serve on a part-time basis. The city manager, a full-time professional, serves at the pleasure of the mayor and city council.

The [http://www.cityofelgin.org/77/Mayor-Council current council members] are Corey Dixon, Dustin Good, Rosamaria Martinez, Anthony Ortiz, Tish S. Powell, Carol J. Rauschenberger, F. John Steffen and Steven Thoren.  Elgin's current mayor is David Kaptain and city manager is Rick Kozal.

The city council meets the second and fourth Wednesday of each month at 6:00&nbsp;p.m. in the council chambers, located on the second floor of City Hall. Agenda and minutes are available on the city's website.  Residents may attend in person at City Hall, watch the live video stream from the online newsroom, or view the replays on cable Channel 17.

The city is represented in the Illinois legislature by Representatives [[Anna Moeller]] (D), [[Dan Ugaste]] (R), and [[Fred Crespo]] (D) and Senators Cristina Castro (D) and [[Don DeWitte]] (R). In the US House of Representatives, Elgin is represented by [[Lauren Underwood]] (D), [[Delia Ramirez]] (D), and [[Raja Krishnamoorthi]] (D).

Elgin includes portions of [[Hanover Township, Cook County, Illinois|Hanover Township]] in Cook County and [[Elgin Township, Kane County, Illinois|Elgin Township]], Plato Township, Rutland Township, Dundee Township, and Campton Township in Kane County.

In 1936, a [[United States commemorative coins|commemorative]] [[silver]] half dollar was issued by the [[United States Mint]] commemorating the centennial of Elgin. The coin was meant to raise money for the pioneer family memorial proposed by Elgin sculptor [[Trygve Rovelstad]], and sold for $1.50. The obverse features the profile of a pioneer with the dates 1673 * 1936, while the reverse features a pioneer family; both images are based on a centennial "Pioneer Medal" made by Rovelstad.<ref name="coinfacts.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.coinfacts.com/commemoratives/half_dollar_commems/elgin.htm |title=Elgin Commemorative Half Dollar |publisher=Coinfacts.com |date=November 11, 2001 |access-date=March 16, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203084632/http://www.coinfacts.com/commemoratives/half_dollar_commems/elgin.htm |archive-date=February 3, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> The date 1673 was in reference to the expedition of [[Louis Jolliet]] and [[Jacques Marquette]], despite the fact that their journey took them nowhere near the future site of Elgin.

The coin did not prove to be a popular success, probably because of the [[Great Depression]] and the great variety of commemorative coins being issued at the time. Five thousand of the 25,000 coins initially minted were unsold and melted down by the mint. Rovelstad's pioneer statue was not installed until 2001.
