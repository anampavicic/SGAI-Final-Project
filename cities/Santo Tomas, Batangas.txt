{{TOC limit|3}}

==Etymology==
Santo Tomas got its name from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for [[Thomas Aquinas|Saint Thomas Aquinas]], a [[Catholic]] saint whose patronal feast day is celebrated every March 7.

==History==
{{one source|section|date=July 2022}}
[[File:Sto. Tomas de Aquino Church, Sto. Tomas, Batangas, Apr 2024.jpg|left|thumb|Sto. Tomas de Aquino Church]]
Santo Tomas was founded in 1666, with Manuel Melo as its first head. Originally, it was composed of a large ''poblacion''. When the Spanish friars arrived, their first and foremost objective was to construct a church near the river to satisfy their inclination for water. Thus, the present site of a Roman Catholic church was chosen near the [[San Juan River (Calamba)|San Juan River]]. As years went by, more houses were built around the church. This became the center of the ''poblacion''.

Other groups of houses were scattered all over the area. They were given such odd names as "Kabaong", because of coffin-shaped stones along the road; "Putol" because the trail was cut short by [[Mount Makiling]]; "Aptayin", because "apta" or fine shrimps were found in the brook; "Biga", because [[Alocasia macrorrhizos|biga tree]]s abounded there; and "Camballao", as in "kambal" (twin) because twin rivers divided the place. These different unit groups comprised the barrios of the town.

The natives were by nature God-fearing, peaceful and obedient. Colonial officials did not much have difficulty enforcing decrees and orders. One such irrevocable decree was to change the original names of the ''barrios'' to the names of saints in the Catholic calendar and to place each them under its ''patrotonio''; the former "Pook" and "Aptayin" were joined and called San Bartolome, "Kabaong" was changed to San Vicente, "Biga" to Santa Anastacia, and "Camballao" to San Isidro Sur and San Isidro Norte. The whole town was given the name of ''Santo Tomas de Aquino'', after a [[Thomas Aquinas|saint]] of the [[Dominican Order]] to where most of the first friars belonged. As time went by, more barrios were added to the list each with an assumed name of a saint.

From the year 1666, the head of the town had different titles, variously known as ''captain'' from 1666 to 1782, ''alcalde'' from 1783 to 1788, ''gobernadorcillo'' from 1789 to 1821, ''presidente local'' from 1822 to 1899, ''presidente municipal'' from 1900 to 1930, and ''mayor'' from 1931 to present.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stotomasbatangasph.wordpress.com/about-sto-tomas-2/history/ |title=History &#124; Santo Tomas Batangas |website=Stotomasbatangasph.wordpress.com |date=April 29, 2013 |access-date=December 11, 2016}}</ref>
