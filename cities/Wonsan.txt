== History ==
[[File:Port Lazaref.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Map of Port Lazaref]]

===Ancient history===
Evidence of humans living in the area during the [[Neolithic Period|Neolithic period]] and [[Bronze Age|Bronze age]] was found in the Chungpyongdong (Now promoted to ri) area, where pottery was found. The area was called Eo eul mae (於乙買) and Chonjung county (泉井郡), when it was under the rule of [[Goguryeo]], and became Jungchon county (井泉郡) after it incorporated into the kingdom of [[Silla]] in 681. After [[Taejo of Goryeo]] conquered the region, the region was renamed as yongju (湧州) where it was ruled by a special defense administrator. The area was renamed again as Uiju (宜州), and a fortress was constructed in 1108. From 1258 to 1356, it was part of the [[Ssangseong Prefectures]].<ref name="ency">{{cite web|url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/SearchNavi?keyword=%EC%9B%90%EC%82%B0%EC%8B%9C&ridx=0&tot=5995|title=원산시|website=[[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]}}</ref>

===Modern history===
[[File:Korean War bombing Wonsan.jpg|thumb|Bombing of Wonsan by U.S. during the Korean War]]
In 1854, the Russian Empire surveyed the area and found it highly desirable.<ref>{{Cite thesis |last=Zvetina |first=Edmund J. |title=Imperial Russian Interest and Intervention in Korea, 1860-1903 |date=1952 |degree=Master's |publisher=Loyola University Chicago |url=https://ecommons.luc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2339&context=luc_theses |page=23}}</ref>

Wonsan opened as a trade port in 1880. Its original name was Wonsanjin (元山津), but it was also known by the Russian name of Port Lazarev (Lazaref). Under [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]] (1910–45) it was called Gensan (元山). In 1914 the [[Pyongwon Line|P'yongwon]] and [[Gyeongwon Line|Kyongwon]] railway lines were opened, connecting the city to [[Pyongyang|P'yongyang]] (then known as Heijo) and [[Seoul]] (then Keijo or Kyongsong). Thus, the city gradually developed into an eastern product distribution center. Under the Japanese occupation, the city was heavily industrialized and served as an important point in the distribution of trade between Korea and [[mainland Japan]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}
[[File:Wonsan. Doppelmonument Kim Il-sung - Kim Jong-il.jpg|thumb|Statues of [[Kim Il Sung]] and [[Kim Jong Il]] in Wonsan]]
After the [[Korean War]] broke out it was captured by [[United States|American]] and [[South Korea]]n troops on 10 October 1950 during their drive north. When they left ahead of the [[People's Volunteer Army|Chinese]] counter-attack, the city fell under Chinese control on 9 December 1950. It was heavily bombed and shelled by the [[United Nations]] in the [[Blockade of Wonsan]] during the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1951/06/30/archives/wonsan-key-seaport-before-war-started-badly-crippled-by-un-air-and.html | title=Wonsan Key Seaport Before War Started; Badly Crippled by U.N. Air and Sea Attacks | work=[[New York Times]] |date= June 30, 1951 | access-date =2009-02-17}}</ref> According to the official US Navy history, Wonsan was under continuous siege and bombardment by the American navy from March 1951 until July 27, 1953, making it the longest siege in modern American naval history. By the war's end, the city was a vast shell.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Halliday|first1=Jon|last2=Cumings|first2=Bruce|year=1988|title=Korea, the Unknown War|location=New York|publisher=Pantheon Books|page=157}}</ref>

===City centre redevelopment===

[[Kim Jong Un]] announced in 2015 plans for a $582 million redevelopment of the city center, which is to be entirely demolished and rebuilt. A 5-star hotel, a 17-story Wonsan International Finance Centre, and a $9.6m exhibition hall are expected to be built.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fingfx.thomsonreuters.com/gfx/rngs/NORTHKOREA-TOURISM/0100516J2NK/index.html|title=Wonsan: Where tourism meets tanks|work=Reuters}}</ref>

[[Kim Jong Un]] maintains a private compound in Wonsan that includes a palace with several guest houses, a harbor with a boathouse, a beach, and a racehorse track.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/kim-jong-un-satellitenfotos-deuten-auf-abstechers-in-villa-am-meer-hin-a-3dbc1b9e-982d-4b9d-bacb-2406dd661a82 |title=Satellitenfotos deuten auf Abstecher in Luxusanwesen am Meer hin |work=[[Der Spiegel]] |language=de |date=April 29, 2020 |access-date=April 29, 2020}}</ref>

===Provincial borders===
Wonsan used to be in [[South Hamgyong Province|South Hamgyong]], but when provincial borders were redrawn in 1946, it joined the northern half of [[Kangwon Province (North Korea)|Kangwon]] (which had been split at the [[38th parallel north]] into a zone under Soviet control in the north and one of American control in the south in 1945) and became its capital, as Kangwon's traditional capitals [[Wonju]] (1395–1895) and [[Chuncheon|Ch'unch'on]] (since 1896) both were south of the 38th parallel and south of the [[Military Demarcation Line (Korea)|Military Demarcation Line]] that replaced the 38th parallel as a border in 1953.

== Food ==
Due to it being a coastal city, seafood is commonly consumed in Wonsan.

Wonsan is known for many local seafood delicacies including boiled rice with clam meat, a speciality of Kangwon Province.

== Economy ==
Wonsan has an aquatic product processing factory, shipyard, chemistry enterprise, a cement factory, as well as the [[4 June Rolling Stock Works]], which is one of the DPRK's largest railway rolling stock factories.<ref name="Hayato">Kokubu, Hayato (2007). 将軍様の鉄道  (Shōgun-sama no Tetsudō). Tokyo. p. 130. {{ISBN|978-4-10-303731-6}}.</ref>
The Wonsan-Mt. Kumgang International Tourist Zone, announced in 2014, was set to become an investment hub in North Korea. The investment proposal, titled 'Integrated Development of Jung-dong,' aims to construct 4 blocks of 30-storied and 6 blocks of 21-storied apartments for lease in No.1 and No.2 districts. The proposal includes around 2,000 flats with 3-4 living rooms. The area is primarily developed for foreign investors and is adjacent to "Office Work" complexes, including an international financial building, leasing office building, and restaurants specializing in International cuisine. The plan also includes an international finance complex, which was previously referred to as a "financial service center" but has been renamed to "financial complex."

On 15 July 2016, KCNA announced<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wonsan-Kalma Coastal Tourist Area |url=http://www.nkeconwatch.com/2018/01/31/wonsan-kalma-peninsula-construction-verified/ |access-date=2023-06-29 |website=North Korean Economy Watch |language=en-US}}</ref> that the Kalma area, located on the central east coast of Korea, will be turned into a tourist resort. The area boasts of four-kilometer-long beach resort, not far away from such scenic spots as Mt. Kumgang, Lake Sijung, Chongsokjong and Lagoon Samil and the Masikryong Ski Resort.

It remained a priority project for the following years until 2020 when the further works on it were completely halted. Most of the work on it is done and it is expected that it would be completed and will be opened for tourists after the country reopens its borders for tourism again.
At night, the city is bright and well lit at par with Pyongyang.

== Transportation ==
===Road and rail===
The district of Wonsan-si is served by several stations on the [[Kangwon Line]] of the [[Korean State Railway]], including a branch to the [[Wŏnsanhang Station|port]]; it is also connected to the national road network, and is the terminus of the [[P'yŏngyang-Wŏnsan Tourist Motorway|P'yongyang-Wonsan Tourist Motorway]] and the Wonsan-Kŭmgangsan Highway.
