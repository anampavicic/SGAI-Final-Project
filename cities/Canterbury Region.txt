'''Canterbury''' ({{lang-mi|Waitaha}}) is a [[Regions of New Zealand|region]] of New Zealand, located in the central-eastern [[South Island]]. The region covers an area of {{convert|44503.88|km2}}, making it the largest region in the country by area. It is home to a population of {{NZ population data 2018|Canterbury region|y|y|y|(|).}}

The region in its current form was established in 1989 during nationwide local government reforms. The [[Kaikōura District]] joined the region in 1992 following the abolition of the Nelson-Marlborough Regional Council.

[[Christchurch]], the South Island's largest city and the country's second-largest urban area, is the seat of the region and home to {{Rnd|{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Christchurch|y}}|R}}/{{formatnum:{{NZ population data 2018|Canterbury region|y}}|R}}*100|0}} percent of the region's population. Other major towns and cities include [[Timaru]], [[Ashburton, New Zealand|Ashburton]], [[Rangiora]] and [[Rolleston, New Zealand|Rolleston]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Canterbury Region}}

=== Natural history ===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2021}}
The land, water, flora, and fauna of Canterbury has a long history, stretching from creation of the greywacke basement rocks that make up the [[Southern Alps]] to the arrival of the first humans. This history is linked to the solidification and development of tectonic plates, the development of oceans and then life itself.

The region is a part of the larger [[Zealandia]] continent, itself a part of the larger Australian and Pacific tectonic plates. In the first instance, the land is based upon the constructive tectonic forces of this convergent and transformational tectonic plate boundary. In the second instance, the erosive forces of rain, snow, ice, and rock grinding against rock have developed large gravel fans that extend out from the mountains. In the third instance, there is volcanism punching through the basement rocks and blanket of sediments to the surface. Upon this solid foundation, and slowly over the billions of years, life made up of a countless generations of interconnected adaptations developed into the unique flora and fauna of Aotearoa/New Zealand. The remnants populations of these unique species are visible today in the publicly protected conservation lands.

The species of Waitaha/Canterbury were adapted to the climate and geography that traverses inland from the coastline to the highest peaks, and from the warmer climes in the north to the colder in the south.

===Before European settlement===
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2021}}
Canterbury has been populated by a succession of [[Māori people]]s over the centuries. When European settlers arrived, it was occupied by [[Ngāi Tahu]], whose numbers had been greatly reduced by warfare, among themselves and with [[Te Rauparaha]] and his [[Ngāti Toa]] from the North Island, in the early 19th century.

=== Colonisation  ===
In 1848, [[Edward Gibbon Wakefield]], a Briton, and [[John Robert Godley]], an [[Anglo-Irish]] aristocrat, founded the [[Canterbury Association]] to establish an [[Church of England|Anglican]] colony in the [[South Island]]. The colony was based upon theories developed by Wakefield while in prison for eloping with a woman not-of-age. Due to ties to the [[University of Oxford]], the Canterbury Association succeeded in raising sufficient funds and recruiting middle-class and upper-class settlers.<ref name="frontierofdreams">John Parker, ''Frontier of Dreams: From Treaty to Nationhood (1830–1913)'', Auckland, NZ: Scholastic (NZ) Ltd, 2005 ({{ISBN|978-1-86943-681-0}}), pp. 58–59</ref> In April 1850, a preliminary group led by Godley landed at Port Cooper – modern-day [[Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraupō]]<ref>{{LINZ|id=7354|name=Lyttelton Harbour / Whakaraupō|access-date=21 October 2021}}</ref> – and established a port, housing and shops in preparation for the main body of settlers. In December 1850, the first wave of 750 settlers arrived at Lyttelton in a [[First Four Ships|fleet of four ships]].<ref name="frontierofdreams" />

Following 1850, the province's economy developed with the introduction of sheep farming. The Canterbury region's tussock plains in particular were suitable for extensive sheep farming. Since they were highly valued by settlers for their meat and wool, there were over half a million sheep in the region by the early 1850s. By the 1860s, this figure had risen to three million.<ref name="frontierofdreams" /> During this period, the architect [[Benjamin Mountfort]] designed many civic and ecclesiastical buildings in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] style.

===Canterbury Province===
{{Main|Canterbury Province}}
The [[Canterbury Province]] was formed in 1853 following the passing of the [[New Zealand Constitution Act 1852]]. It was formed from part of [[New Munster Province]] and covered the middle part of the South Island, stretching from the east coast to the west coast. The province was abolished, along with other provinces of New Zealand, when the Abolition of the Provinces Act came into force on 1 November 1876.<ref>{{cite web |title=New Zealand provinces 1848–77 |url=http://rulers.org/newzprov.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203020514/https://rulers.org/newzprov.html |archive-date=February 3, 2012 |website=rulers.org}}</ref> The modern Canterbury Region has slightly different boundaries, particularly in the north, where it includes some districts from the old [[Nelson Province]].

== Geography ==
{{main|Geology of the Canterbury Region}}
The area administered by the Canterbury Regional Council consists of all the river catchments on the east coast of the South Island from that of the [[Waiau Toa / Clarence River]], north of [[Kaikōura]], to that of the [[Waitaki River]], in South Canterbury. It is New Zealand's largest region by area, with an area of 45,346&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.

Canterbury was traditionally bounded in the north by the [[Conway River, New Zealand|Conway River]], to the west by the [[Southern Alps]], and to the south by the [[Waitaki River]]. The area is commonly divided into North Canterbury (north of the [[Rakaia River]] to the Conway River), [[Mid Canterbury]] (from the Rakaia River to the [[Rangitata River]]), [[South Canterbury]] (south of the Rangitata River to the Waitaki River) and [[Christchurch]] City.

In the 2013 census, just under 20 percent of Canterbury's population was born overseas, compared to 25 percent for New Zealand as a whole. The British Isles remains the largest region of origin, accounting for 36.5 percent of the overseas-born population in Canterbury. Around a quarter of Canterbury's overseas-born population at the 2013 Census had been living in New Zealand for less than five years, and 11 percent had been living in New Zealand for less than two years (i.e. they moved to New Zealand after the 2011 Christchurch earthquake).<ref name="NZdotstat">{{cite web|url=http://nzdotstat.stats.govt.nz/wbos/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TABLECODE8041|title=Birthplace (detailed), for the census usually resident population count, 2001, 2006, and 2013 (RC, TA) – NZ.Stat|publisher=Statistics New Zealand|access-date=23 January 2016}}</ref><ref name="quickstats_culture"/>

[[File:Crossing the Macauley River, Lilybank Station, Canterbury, New Zealand, 1977.jpg|thumb|Crossing the [[Macauley River]], Lilybank Station, Canterbury, New Zealand, 1977.]]
The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the Canterbury region was estimated at NZ$44.2 billion in the year to March 2022, representing 12.4% of New Zealand's national GDP.  The regional GDP per filled job was $126,733, 4.6% below the national average of $132,815.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Te Tirohanga ā-Rohe {{!}} Regional overview |url=https://www.mbie.govt.nz/business-and-employment/employment-and-skills/regional-skills-leadership-groups/canterbury/regional-workforce-plans/canterbury-regional-workforce-plan-2023/te-tirohanga-a-rohe-regional-overview/ |access-date=22 April 2024 |website=[[Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment]]}}</ref>

=== Agriculture ===
Agriculture contributed $3.26 billion to the regional economy in the year ended March 2022.<ref name=":1" /> The agriculture sector is diversified into dairy farming, sheep farming and [[horticulture]] particularly [[viticulture]].<ref name="cnr8">{{cite encyclopedia|url= http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/canterbury-region/8|title=Canterbury region: Agriculture after 1900|last=Wilson|first=John |date=2 March 2009|encyclopedia=Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand|access-date=11 June 2010}}</ref> The strength of the region's agricultural economy is displayed every November at the [[Canterbury A&P Show]]. The show coincides with the regional anniversary day and Cup Week. During the interwar period, agricultural productivity was boosted by the introduction of mechanization, lime and the improvement of seed stocks. Canterbury is also New Zealand's main producer of cereal crops such as wheat, barley and oats.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Espig |first1=Martin |last2=Dynes |first2=Robyn A. |last3=Henwood |first3=Roxanne J.

The region's viticulture industry was established by French settlers in [[Akaroa]]. Since then, wine-growing is concentrated into two regions: [[Waipara]] and [[Burnham, New Zealand|Burnham]].<ref name="cnr8" /> Recently, there have been vintages from plantings from [[Kurow]] further to the south. [[White wine]] has typically predominated in Canterbury from [[Riesling]], [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Chardonnay]], [[Gewürztraminer]], and to a lesser extent [[Pinot blanc]] and [[Pinot gris]]. [[Pinot noir]] has had some success in the province, particularly in Waipara.

{{see also|Environment of New Zealand}}
Like much of the [[Canterbury-Otago tussock grasslands]] the [[Canterbury Plains]] have been highly modified since human settlement and now support a large agricultural industry. Prior to the arrival of [[Māori people|Māori]] settlers in the 13th century, much of the modern Canterbury region was covered in scrub and beech forests. Forest fires destroyed much of the original [[forest cover]] which was succeeded by tussock grassland. By the 19th century, only ten percent of this forest cover remained, and the European settlers introduced several new exotic [[grass]], [[lupin]], [[pine]] and [[Hesperocyparis macrocarpa|macrocarpa]] that gradually supplanted the native vegetation. Much of the native vegetation was isolated to the [[alpine zone]]s and Banks Peninsula. From a minimum of about one percent of its original forest cover in circa 1900, the amount of forest on Banks Peninsula has increased.

The amount of dairy farming is increasing with a corresponding increase in demand for water. Water use is now becoming a contentious issue in Canterbury. Lowland rivers and streams are generally polluted and some of the aquifers are being overdrawn. The [[Central Plains Water]] scheme is a proposal for water storage that has attracted much controversy. The [[Canterbury Water Management Strategy]] is one of the many means being used to address the water issue.

The [[Canterbury mudfish]] (kowaro) is an endangered species that is monitored by the Department of Conservation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mudfish: New Zealand Freshwater Fish |url=https://www.doc.govt.nz/nature/native-animals/freshwater-fish/mudfish/ |website=doc.govt.nz |publisher=Department of Conservation |access-date=22 February 2019}}</ref>

==Government and politics==
{{more citations needed section|date=April 2024}}

===Local government===
The Canterbury region is administered by the [[Canterbury Regional Council (Environment Canterbury)|Canterbury Regional Council]]. The area includes ten [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|territorial authorities]], including [[Christchurch City Council]] and part of the [[Waitaki District]], the other part of which is in Otago. Following the [[1989 local government reforms|local government reform of 1989]], [[Kaikōura District]] was part of the [[Nelson-Marlborough Regional Council|Nelson-Marlborough Region]]. That region was later abolished and replaced with three [[unitary authorities]]. Kaikōura was too small to function as an independent unitary authority and was moved under the jurisdiction of the Canterbury Regional Council in 1992. However, Kaikōura remains part of Marlborough in the minds of many people. In 2006, the Banks Peninsula District was merged into Christchurch City following a 2005 referendum.

===National government===
The Canterbury Region is covered by ten general electorates and one Māori electorate. The city of Christchurch as a whole consists of five of these electorates, while the electorate of [[Waimakariri (New Zealand electorate)|Waimakariri]] contains a mix of Christchurch and exurban Canterbury. The [[Banks Peninsula (New Zealand electorate)|Banks Peninsula]], [[Ilam (New Zealand electorate)|Ilam]], and [[Waimakariri (New Zealand electorate)|Waimakariri]] electorates are currently held by members of the governing [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] (as part of the coalition-led [[Sixth National Government of New Zealand]]) [[Vanessa Weenink]], [[Hamish Campbell]], and [[Matt Doocey]]. Meanwhile, the [[Christchurch Central]], [[Christchurch East]], and [[Wigram (New Zealand electorate)|Wigram]] electorates are currently held by opposition ([[Labour Party (New Zealand)|Labour Party]]) members [[Duncan Webb]], [[Reuben Davidson]], and [[Megan Woods]] respectively.

In contrast to Christchurch, much of the surrounding Canterbury region is dominated by the National Party due to its ties to rural farming and business interests. The large [[Kaikōura (New Zealand electorate)|Kaikōura]] electorate covers all of the [[Marlborough Region]] and northern Canterbury and is represented by National MP [[Stuart Smith (politician)|Stuart Smith]]. The substantial [[Waitaki (New Zealand electorate)|Waitaki]] electorate, held by National MP [[Miles Anderson (politician)|Miles Anderson]], covers most of [[South Canterbury]] and neighbouring [[North Otago]]. [[Rangitata (New Zealand electorate)|Rangitata]] and [[Selwyn (New Zealand electorate)|Selwyn]] are held by National members [[James Meager]] and [[Nicola Grigg]] respectively.

Under the [[Māori electorates]] system, Canterbury is part of the large [[Te Tai Tonga (New Zealand electorate)|Te Tai Tonga]] electorate which covers the entire South Island, the surrounding islands and most of [[Wellington]] in the North Island. It is currently held by [[Tākuta Ferris]] of [[Te Pāti Māori]].

Judicially, the region is served by four [[District Court of New Zealand|District Courts]] at Christchurch, Ashburton, Timaru and Kaikōura, and two [[High Court of New Zealand|High Courts]] at Christchurch and Timaru.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/utilities/contact/courts|title=Contact a court – Courts of New Zealand|website=courtsofnz.govt.nz|access-date=27 June 2019}}</ref> The Christchurch High Court also hosts a divisional court of the [[Court of Appeal of New Zealand|Court of Appeal]].

==Transport==
{{See also|Public transport in Christchurch}}

[[State Highway 1 (New Zealand)|State Highway 1]] runs the length of Canterbury, connecting north to [[Blenheim, New Zealand|Blenheim]] and the Cook Strait ferry terminal at [[Picton, New Zealand|Picton]] and south to [[Oamaru]], [[Dunedin]] and [[Invercargill]].

[[Christchurch International Airport]], located in [[Harewood, New Zealand|Harewood]] on the northwest outskirts of Christchurch, is the region's main airport. Regular flights operate from Christchurch to most major centres in New Zealand, as well as Australia, the Pacific Islands and eastern Asia. Timaru's [[Richard Pearse Airport]] serves South Canterbury with daily flights to [[Wellington International Airport|Wellington]].

==Education==
{{see also|List of schools in Canterbury Region|List of schools in Christchurch}}
Canterbury is served by 292 primary and secondary schools, educating around 94,000 students from ages 5 to 18. Around 13 percent of students attend [[state-integrated school]]s and 5 percent attend private schools, with the remaining 82 percent attending state schools.{{NZ school roll data||||y}} Christchurch and Timaru have single-sex state secondary schools.

Canterbury has two universities: the [[University of Canterbury]] located in western Christchurch, and [[Lincoln University (New Zealand)|Lincoln University]] located in Lincoln.

Sport in Canterbury has developed from the time of the initial settlement by British migrants, and remains an important part of community life. [[Cricket]] and [[rugby union]] have been popular team sports since the early years of settlement, with the first cricket club established in Christchurch in 1851, and the first rugby club in 1863. Interest in organised sports has diversified and now includes a wide range of codes.<ref>{{cite web |last=Wilson |first=John |date=6 July 2015 |title=Canterbury region – Sport and leisure |url=https://teara.govt.nz/en/canterbury-region/page-16 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240615024331/https://teara.govt.nz/en/canterbury-region/page-16 |archive-date=15 June 2024 |access-date=4 July 2024 |website=[[Te Ara: The Encyclopedia of New Zealand]]}}</ref> In 2022, the top five sporting codes in Canterbury based on club membership were [[netball]], [[touch rugby]], rugby union, [[golf]] and cricket.<ref name="sportreport">{{Cite web |title=2022 Sport Report |url=https://www.sportcanterbury.org.nz/asset/downloadasset?id=db08f97f-a4bd-4224-a09e-6cdbdad79ebf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240712032512/https://www.sportcanterbury.org.nz/asset/downloadasset?id=db08f97f-a4bd-4224-a09e-6cdbdad79ebf |archive-date=12 July 2024 |access-date=7 July 2024 |website=Sport Canterbury}}</ref>

Notable teams representing Christchurch or the Canterbury region include the [[Mainland Tactix]] (netball), [[Crusaders (rugby union)|Crusaders]] (rugby) and the [[Canterbury cricket team|Canterbury Kings]] (cricket).

The Crusaders, who play in the [[Super Rugby]] competition, are based in Christchurch. They represent Canterbury and other provinces of the upper South Island. They were formerly known as the ''Canterbury Crusaders''. In provincial rugby, Canterbury is represented by three unions; [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]], [[Mid Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Mid Canterbury]] and [[South Canterbury Rugby Football Union|South Canterbury]]. For historical reasons, players from Kaikōura District still play for the Marlborough Rugby Union, which is part of the Tasman Provincial team (Nelson/Marlborough Unions combined). Other sporting teams include the [[Mainland Tactix]] (netball), [[Canterbury United FC]] (football) and [[Canterbury Rams]] (basketball).
