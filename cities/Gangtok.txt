'''Gangtok''' ({{IPA-ne|gantok|lang}} {{IAST|gāntok}}, {{IPA|sip|ɡaŋt̪ʰòk|lang}}) is the capital and the most populous city of the [[India]]n state of [[Sikkim]]. The seat of [[East Sikkim district|eponymous district]], Gangtok is in the eastern [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range, at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}. The city's population of 100,000 consists of the three [[Sikkimese people|Sikkimese]] ethnicities: the [[Bhutias]], [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]], [[Nepalis]] as well as plainsmen from other states of India. Within the higher peaks of the [[Himalayas]] and with a year-round mild [[temperate]] climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry.

Gangtok rose to prominence as a popular [[Buddhist pilgrimage sites|Buddhist pilgrimage]] site after the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese [[Chogyal]], [[Thutob Namgyal]], transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the [[trade route]] between [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] and cities such as [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta) in [[British India]]. After India won its independence from the [[British Empire]] in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. After Sikkim's merger with India in 1975, Gangtok continued as the state capital.

==Etymology==
The precise meaning of the name "Gangtok" is unclear, though most agree that the meaning is "hill top".<ref name="telegang"/>

== History ==
{{See also|History of Sikkim}}
Like the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok.<ref name="TT20031006"/> The earliest records date from the construction of the [[hermit]]ic Gangtok monastery in 1716.<ref name="bernier1"/> Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840 made it a pilgrimage centre. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after its English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the [[History of Tibet|defeat of the Tibetans]] by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century.<ref name="nslepcha"/> Most of the roads and the [[telegraph]] in the area were built during this time.

In 1894, [[Thutob Namgyal]], the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from [[Tumlong]] to Gangtok, increasing the city's importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947, Sikkim became a [[nation-state]] with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the [[suzerainty]] of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the [[Chogyal]] and the then [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name="HISTORY OF SIKKIM"/> This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet flourished through the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelep La|Jelepla passes]], benefiting Gangtok. Trade declined with the Chinese crackdown in Tibet in 1959 and the passes were sealed after the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962.<ref name="nathuladown"/><ref name=Harris>{{citation |last=Harris |first=Tina |title=Geographical Diversions: Tibetan Trade, Global Transactions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JxCotCnoGrUC&pg=PA40 |year=2013 |publisher=University of Georgia Press |isbn=978-0-8203-4512-3 |pages=39–41}}</ref> The Nathula pass was finally opened to limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.<ref name="bbc-1"/>

In 1975, after years of political uncertainty and struggle, including riots, the monarchy was abrogated and Sikkim became India's twenty-second state, with Gangtok as its capital after a referendum.<!---Nest&Wings pg-21-24|NaW---> Gangtok has witnessed annual [[landslide]]s, resulting in loss of life and damage to property. The largest disaster occurred in June 1997, when 38 were killed and hundreds of buildings were destroyed.<ref name="chap4"/>

Gangtok is located at {{Coord|27.3325|N|88.6140|E|}} (coordinates of Gangtok head post office).<ref name="FallinGrain" /> It is in the lower Himalayas at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="metgang" /> The town is on the side of a hill, with "The Ridge",<ref name="nslepcha" /><ref name="discoveringbook" /> a promenade with the [[Raj Bhavan, Gangtok|Raj Bhawan]], the [[governor]]'s residence, at one end and the palace, at an altitude of about {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, at the other. The city is flanked east and west by two streams, [[Roro Chu]] and [[Ranikhola]].<ref name="chap4" /> These two rivers divide the natural drainage into two parts, eastern and western. Both streams meet the Ranipul and flow south as the Ranikhola before joining the [[Teesta River|Teesta]] at [[Singtam]].<ref name="chap4" /> Most roads are steep, with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them.<ref name="mapsindiagang" />

[[File:Ban Jhakri Falls - Gangtok.jpg|thumb|right|[[Banjhakri Falls and Energy Park|Banjhakri Falls]] – Gangtok]]
Most of [[Sikkim]], including Gangtok, is underlain by [[Precambrian]] rocks which contain [[Foliation (geology)|foliated]] [[phyllite]]s and [[schists]]; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides.<ref name="chap2"/> [[Surface runoff]] of water by natural streams (''jhora'') and man-made drains has contributed to the risk of landslides.<ref name="chap4"/> According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], the town falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-IV]] (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the [[convergent boundary]] of the [[India Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[tectonic plate]]s and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town in the distance. Mount [[Kanchenjunga]] ({{Convert|8598|m|abbr=on|disp=or}})—the world's third-highest peak—is visible to the west of the city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.<ref name="chap4"/>

Densely forested regions surround Gangtok, temperate, [[deciduous]] forests of [[Populus|poplar]], [[birch]], [[oak]] and [[elm]], as well as [[evergreen]], [[coniferous]] trees of the [[alpine climate|wet alpine]] zone.<ref name="chap2"/> [[Orchids]] are common and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. [[Bamboo]] is also abundant. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate deciduous and [[subtropical]].<ref name="chap2"/> Flowers such as [[sunflower]], [[Tagetes|marigold]], [[poinsettia]] and others bloom, especially in November and December.

Gangtok has a monsoon-influenced [[subtropical highland climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwb''). Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, [[temperate]] climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]]s, autumn, winter and spring. Temperatures range from an average maximum of {{convert|22|C|F|lk=on|abbr=on|0}} in summertime to an average minimum of {{convert|5|C|F|abbr=on|0}} in winter.<ref name="weatherchart"/> Summers (lasting from late April to May) are mild, with maximum temperatures rarely crossing {{convert|25|C|F|abbr=on|lk=on|0}}. The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains, often causing landslides that block Gangtok's land access to the rest of the country. Rainfall starts to rise from pre-[[monsoon]] in May and peaks during the monsoon, with July recording the highest monthly average of {{convert|649.6|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}.<ref name="weatherchart"/> In winter temperature averages between {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|7|C|F|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name="weatherchart"/> [[Snowfall]] is rare and in recent times, Gangtok has received snow only in 1990, 2004, 2005<ref name="chap2"/> and 2020.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gangtok sees snowfall after 15 years|url=https://www.northeasttoday.in/gangtok-sees-snowfall-after-15-years/|access-date=9 January 2020|work=Northeast Today|date=7 January 2020}}</ref> Temperatures below [[freezing point|freezing]] are also rare.<ref name="chap2"/> During this season the weather can be unstable and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours. During spring and autumn the weather is generally sunny and mild. Owing to its elevation, Gangtok is often enveloped in [[fog]] during the monsoon and winter months.

Gangtok is the main base for Sikkim tourism.<ref name="chap3"/> Summer and spring seasons are the most popular tourist seasons. Many of Gangtok's residents are employed directly and indirectly in the tourism industry, with many residents owning and working in hotels and restaurants.<ref name="bstorist"/>

[[Mahatma Gandhi Marg (Gangtok)|Mahatma Gandhi Marg]] and Lal Market are prominent business areas and tourist spots in Gangtok.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sen|first1=Piyali|title=Secret Gangtok: 5 Things That No One Will Tell You About|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/outlooktraveller/explore/story/70212/secret-gangtok-5-things-that-no-one-will-tell-you-about|access-date=1 September 2020|work=Outlook|date=27 January 2020|language=en}}</ref>

[[Ecotourism]] has emerged as an important economic activity in the region which includes trekking, mountaineering, river rafting and other nature oriented activities.<ref name="chap3"/> An estimated 351,000 tourists visited Sikkim in 2007, generating revenue of about {{INRConvert|500|m|year=2007|lk=r}}.<ref name="bstorist"/>

The [[Nathula Pass]], located about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Gangtok, used to be the primary route of the wool, fur and spice trade with Tibet and spurred economic growth for Gangtok till the mid-20th century. In 1962, after the border was closed during the [[Sino-Indian War]], Gangtok fell into recession.<ref name="nathuladown"/> The pass was reopened in 2006 and trade through the pass has helped to boost the economy of Gangtok.<ref name="chap3"/> Back in 2008 the Sikkim government stated that it was keen to open a [[Lhasa]]–Gangtok bus service via the Nathula Pass<ref name="Sinha2005"/> though 15 years later no such service has materialised. Sikkim's mountainous terrain limits the area's potential for rapid industrial development.<ref name="chap3"/> The government is the largest employer in the city,<ref name="chap4"/> both directly and as conttractors.

Gangtok's economy does not have a large manufacturing base, but has a thriving [[Cottage industry]] in watch-making, [[grain alcohol|country-made alcohol]] and handicrafts.<ref name="chap3"/> Among the handicrafts are the handmade paper industry made from various vegetable fibres or cotton rags. The main market in Gangtok provides many of the state's rural residents a place to offer their produce during the harvest seasons. The majority of the private business community is made up of [[Marwari people|Marwaris]] and [[Bihari people|Biharis]]. As part of Sikkim, Gangtok enjoys the status of being an income-tax free region as per the state's 1948 Income tax law.<ref name="Business Line"/> As Sikkim is a frontier state, the [[Indian army]] maintains a large presence in the vicinity of Gangtok. This leads to a population of semi-permanent residents who bring money into the local economy.<ref name="hindu29062003"/> The Sikkim government started India's first [[Online gambling|online lottery]] ''[[Playwin]]'' to boost government income, but this was later closed by a ruling from the Sikkim High Court.<ref name="Playwin lottery"/>

Agriculture is a large employer in Sikkim and in 2003 the [[Sikkim]] state government declared the goal of converting the whole sector to organic production.<ref name=4strategies>Paull, John (2017) [https://www.academia.edu/35179966/Four_New_Strategies_to_Grow_the_Organic_Agriculture_Sector "Four New Strategies to Grow the Organic Agriculture Sector"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304181540/http://www.academia.edu/35179966/Four_New_Strategies_to_Grow_the_Organic_Agriculture_Sector|date=4 March 2018}}, Agrofor International Journal, 2(3):61-70.</ref> The goal of 100% organic was achieved in 2016.<ref name=4strategies/> This achievement offers new [[export]] opportunities to grow the agriculture sector, to achieve premium prices and new opportunities for [[agritourism]].<ref name=4strategies/>

Gangtok is administered by the [[Gangtok Municipal Corporation]] (GMC) along with the various departments of the [[Government of Sikkim]], particularly the [[Urban Development and Housing Department (Sikkim)|Urban Development and Housing Department]] (UDHD) and the Public Health Engineering Department (PHED).<ref name="chap4"/><ref name="UDHD"/> These departments provide municipal functions such as garbage disposal, water supply, tax collection, licence allotments, and civic infrastructure. An administrator appointed by the state government heads the UDHD.<ref name="chap8"/><!-- Elections to the wards of the first municipal corporation was held on 11 June 2008.<ref name="wardelec">{{cite web|url = http://beacononline.wordpress.com/2008/04/02/civic-polls-in-sikkim-on-june-11/|title = Civic polls in Sikkim on 11 June|access-date = 22 May 2008|publisher = The Himalayan Beacon}}</ref> -->

As the headquarters of [[East Sikkim]] district, Gangtok houses the offices of the [[district collector]], an administrator appointed by the Union Government of India. Gangtok is also the seat of the [[Sikkim High Court]], which is India's smallest [[High Courts of India|High Court]] in terms of area and population of jurisdiction.<ref name="smallhc"/> Gangtok does not have its own police commissionerate like other major cities in India. Instead, it comes under the jurisdiction of the state police, which is headed by a [[Director General of Police]], although an [[Inspector General of Police]] oversees the town.<ref name="govtofficers-IPS"/> Sikkim is known for its very low crime rate.<ref name="Police"/> Rongyek jail in Gangtok is Sikkim's only central jail.<ref name="prison2005"/>

Gangtok is within the [[Sikkim Lok Sabha constituency]] that elects a member to the Lok Sabha ([[Lower House]]) of the [[Indian Parliament]]. The city elects one member in the Sikkim state legislative assembly, the [[Vidhan Sabha]]. The [[Sikkim Democratic Front]] (SDF) won both the [[2009 Indian general election|parliamentary election in 2009]] and the state assembly seat in the [[2009 Sikkim Legislative Assembly election|2009 state assembly polls]].<ref name="12sk01"/><ref name="result-sikkim-assembly-2004"/>

== Utility services ==
Electricity is supplied by the power department of the [[Government of Sikkim]]. Gangtok has a nearly uninterrupted electricity supply due to Sikkim's numerous hydroelectric power stations. The rural roads around Gangtok are maintained by the [[Border Roads Organisation]], a division of the [[Indian army]]. Several roads in Gangtok are reported to be in a poor condition,<ref name="chap4"/> whereas building construction activities continue almost unrestrained in this city lacking proper land infrastructure.<ref name="chap4"/> Most households are supplied by the central water system maintained and operated by the PHED.<ref name="chap4"/> The main source of PHED water supply is the [[Rateychu River]], located about {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city, at an altitude of {{convert|2621|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Its water treatment plant is located at Selep. The river Rateychu is snow-fed and has perennial streams. Since there is no habitation in the catchment area except for a small army settlement, there is little environmental degradation and the water is of very good quality.<ref name="chap4"/> 40 seasonal local springs are used by the Rural Management and Development Department of Sikkim Government to supply water to outlying rural areas.

Around 40% of the population has access to sewers.<ref name="chap4"/> However, only the toilet waste is connected to the sewer while [[sullage]] is discharged into the drains.<ref name="chap4"/> Without a proper sanitation system, the practice of disposing sewage through septic tanks and directly discharging into ''Jhora''s and open drains is prevalent.<ref name="chap4"/> The entire city drains into the two rivers, [[Ranikhola]] and [[Roro Chu]], through numerous small streams and Jhoras. Ranikhola and Roro Chu rivers confluence with [[Teesta River]], the major source of drinking water to the population downstream. The densely populated urban area of Gangtok does not have a combined drainage system to drain out the stormwater and wastewater from the buildings.<ref name="chap4"/> The estimated solid waste generated in Gangtok city is approximately 45&nbsp;[[tonne]]s.<ref name="chap4"/> Only around 40% of this is collected by UDHD, while the remainder is indiscriminately thrown into ''Jhora'', streets and valleys.<ref name="chap4"/> The collected waste is disposed in a dump located about {{convert|20|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city. There is no waste collection from inaccessible areas where vehicles cannot reach, nor does any system of collection of waste exist in the adjoining rural areas. The city is under a statewide ban on the use of polythene bags.<ref name="chap4"/>

=== Road ===
[[Taxicab|Taxis]] are the most widely available public transport within Gangtok.<ref name="chap2"/> Most of the residents stay within a few kilometres of the town centre<ref name="GangtokCdp-Chapter4-p4–25"/> and many have their own vehicles such as [[motorcycle|two-wheelers]] and cars.<ref name="GangtokCdp-Chapter4-p4–27"/> The share of personal vehicles and taxis combined is 98% of Gangtok's total vehicles, a high percentage when compared to other Indian cities.<ref name="chap2"/> City buses constitute less than one per cent of vehicles.<ref name="chap2"/> Those travelling longer distances generally make use of share-jeeps, a kind of public taxis. [[Four wheel drive]]s are used to easily navigate the steep slopes of the roads. The {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on|1}} long [[Aerial tramway|cable car]] with three stops connects lower Gangtok suburbs with Sikkim Legislative assembly in central Gangtok and the upper suburbs.<ref name="Gangtok ropeway"/>

Gangtok is connected to the rest of India by an all-weather metalled highway, [[National Highway 10 (India)|National Highway 10]] (NH10),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Bengal-Sikkim-tussle-over-NH-10/articleshow/48430608.cms|title=Bengal-Sikkim tussle over NH-10|date=11 August 2015|first=Rohit|last=Khanna|website=[[The Times of India]]|access-date=13 July 2016|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170105071053/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/Bengal-Sikkim-tussle-over-NH-10/articleshow/48430608.cms|archive-date=5 January 2017}}</ref> earlier known as [[National Highway 31A (India)|National Highway 31A]], which links Gangtok to [[Siliguri]], located {{convert|114|km|mi|abbr=on|0}} away in the neighbouring state of [[West Bengal]].
