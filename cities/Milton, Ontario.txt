Milton is located {{convert|54|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of [[Downtown Toronto]] on [[Ontario Highway 401|Highway 401]], and is the western terminus for the [[Milton line]] commuter train and bus corridor operated by [[GO Transit]]. Milton is situated on the [[Niagara Escarpment]], a [[UNESCO]] world [[biosphere reserve]] and the [[Bruce Trail]].

==History==
The [[Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation|Mississaugas of the Credit]] held 648,000 acres of land north of the Head of the Lake Purchase lands and extending to the unceded territory of the Chippewa of Lakes Huron and Simcoe. In mid-October, 1818, the Chippewa ceded their land to the Crown in the Lake Simcoe-Nottawasaga Treaty and, by the end of October, the Crown sought to purchase the adjacent lands of the Mississaugas of the Credit. 
The Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Department, [[William Claus]], met with the Mississaugas from October 27–29, 1818, and proposed that the Mississaugas sell their 648,000 acres of land in exchange for an annual amount of goods. The continuous inflow of settlers into their lands and fisheries had weakened the Mississaugas' traditional economy and had left them in a state of impoverishment and a rapidly declining population. In their enfeebled state, Chief Ajetance (d. 1829), on behalf of the assembled people, readily agreed to the sale of their lands for £522.10 of goods paid annually.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ajetance Treaty, No. 19 (1818) |url=http://mncfn.ca/treaty19/ |website=Mississauga of the Credit First Nation |date=28 May 2017 |access-date=7 September 2020 |archive-date=7 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210607035520/http://mncfn.ca/treaty19/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Significant municipalities found within the lands of the Ajetance Purchase of 1818 include Brampton and Milton.

The town took root out of a settlement by Jasper Martin along the [[Sixteen Mile Creek (Ontario)|Sixteen Mile Creek]]; Martin immigrated from [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], [[England]] with his wife Sarah Coates and two sons on May 17, 1818.<ref>{{cite web |title=Plaque: Jasper Martin and Sara Coats |url=http://images.milton.halinet.on.ca/24340/data?n=14 |website=Milton Images |access-date=6 September 2020}}</ref> Martin was granted {{convert|100|acre|ha}} of land, from the Crown in 1820, designated Lot 14, Concession 2, [[Trafalgar Township|Township of Trafalgar]], [[Halton County, Ontario|Halton County]], in the [[Gore District, Upper Canada|District of Gore]]. Martin built a [[grist]] mill along the creek and created a pond, known as Mill Pond, to power his mill. The mill became the centre of settlement for others as they settled in the region. In 1837 the area had a population of approximately 100 people and was named after the English poet [[John Milton]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The Town of Milton|url=http://www.miltonhistoricalsociety.ca/about-us/the-town-of-milton/|publisher=Milton Historical Society|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> The town, as it is today, soon after became known as Milton. The two principal property owners of the young town were the Martins and the Fosters, whose names are still reflected in numerous buildings and streets in Milton<ref>{{cite web|title=Living in Milton, Ontario|url=http://www.milton.ca/Living-0-267.htm|publisher=Town of Milton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060701065404/http://www.milton.ca/Living-0-267.htm|archive-date=1 July 2006}}</ref>

By 1855, the United Counties of Halton and [[Wentworth County, Ontario|Wentworth]] split, and Halton became a separate county. [[Halton County, Ontario|Its council]] consisted of members representing the townships of [[Esquesing]], [[Nassagaweya]], Trafalgar and Nelson, along with [[Acton, Ontario|Acton]], [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]], Milton, [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]] and [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]]. Milton was then named as the [[county town]] (seat), a decision that certainly created a lot of local controversy. The people in Oakville were very upset because Oakville was an established place with a railway. Milton did not even have a railway, according to historian John McDonald.<ref name=Halton200>{{cite web |last1=Hennessey |first1=Melanie |title=Today marks Halton's 200th anniversary |url= http://www.insidehalton.com/news-story/6401384-today-marks-halton-s-200th-anniversary/ |website=Milton Canadian Champion |publisher= Metroland Media Group Ltd |access-date= 27 April 2016 |date=22 March 2016}}</ref> For 25 years there was this great rivalry. Every time county council tried to pass something to improve the Milton area, the Oakville councillors would often balk at it. Hugh Foster, of the aforementioned Foster family, donated {{cvt|4|acre}} of land to the county to construct its administration building in Milton, which is still in place on Mary Street today and now used as the Milton Town Hall. Milton was incorporated into a town in 1857, after being chosen as county seat for Halton.<ref name=Halton200/>

By 1869, Milton had a population of 1,000.<ref>{{cite book |last1=McEvoy |first1=Henry |title= The Province of Ontario Gazetteer and Directory |date=1869 |publisher= Robertson & Cook |location=Ontario |page=[https://archive.org/details/provinceontario00mcevgoog/page/n387 311] |isbn=9780665094125 |url= https://archive.org/details/provinceontario00mcevgoog|quote=Milton. |access-date=20 August 2017}}</ref> Records from 1874 indicate that Milton had county buildings, a telegraph office, a foundry, a tannery, a woolen factory, a grist mill and a saw mill, a weekly newspaper and a number of stores.<ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Crosby |editor1-first=Peter Alfred |title=Lovell's Gazetteer of British North America |date=1874 |publisher=J.

In 1891, Milton used electricity to light its streets for the first time and in 1905 the Town purchased the Milton Electric Light Company and built its own power station.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2506706/page/10|title = Canadian Champion (Milton, ON), 5 Dec 2000, p. 10}}</ref>

In the early 1900s, Milton was well known because of the P.L. Robertson Manufacturing Company, the first to make [[List of screw drives#Robertson|socket-head screws]]. Although formed in Hamilton in 1907, the business relocated to Milton in 1908.<ref>{{cite web |title= Plaque #7 : The P.L. Robertson Manufacturing Company |url= http://www.waynecook.com/ahalton.html |website= Historical Plaques of Halton Region |access-date= 20 August 2017 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170112195740/http://www.waynecook.com/ahalton.html |archive-date= 12 January 2017 |url-status= dead |df= dmy-all }}</ref> [[P.L. Robertson]] was the inventor of the square-socket drive for screws.

In 1974, the present municipal structure was created when the Regional Municipality of Halton replaced Halton County. The new town of Milton added parts of the former township of [[Esquesing Township, Ontario|Esquesing]] (most of this township comprises [[Halton Hills, Ontario|Halton Hills]]), all of [[Nassagaweya Township, Ontario|Nassagaweya Township]] including the village of [[Campbellville, Ontario|Campbellville]], and the northern sections of Trafalgar and Nelson from (a 1962 annexation of the former townships) [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] and [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]] respectively.<ref>{{cite news |title= Annexation By-Law Given Quiet Passing |url= http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2497736/page/1|access-date=20 August 2017 |work=The Canadian Champion |date=6 December 1962 |location= Milton, ON |page=1}}</ref>

With the addition of the [[Niagara Escarpment]] lands, [[tourism]], [[recreation]], and heritage conservation have increased in importance. The [[Halton Region Museum]], which has a large number of historic agricultural buildings, and the [[Halton County Radial Railway]] museum are located in Milton, as is Country Heritage Park (formerly the [[Ontario Agricultural Museum]]). Five large parks operated by [[Conservation Halton]] reside in the town, and [[Mohawk Raceway]] is located near Campbellville. It is also home to [[Maplehurst Correctional Complex]], the [[Vanier Centre for Women]] and one of two criminal courthouses serving Halton Region.<ref>{{cite web |title=Court Services |url=https://www.haltonpolice.ca/RECORDSCOURTS/COURTS/Pages/default.aspx |publisher= Halton Regional Police Service |access-date= 27 April 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420095622/http://www.haltonpolice.ca/RecordsCourts/Courts/Pages/default.aspx |archive-date= 20 April 2014}}</ref>

On January 1st, 2010, land was bought by the City of [[Mississauga]] and scaled down its border by {{cvt|400|acre|km2}} to Hwy. 407, affecting 25 residents.<ref>{{cite web|date=Dec 21, 2009|title=Mississauga Receives Approval for Boundary Realignment|url=http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/home;jsessionid=CYUSNA2ITWIKNTRPH3XD4FWOF25W4PW0?paf_gear_id=9700020&itemId=106100975n&returnUrl=%2Fportal%2Fhome%3Bjsessionid%3DCYUSNA2ITWIKNTRPH3XD4FWOF25W4PW0|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203214422/http://www.mississauga.ca/portal/home;jsessionid=CYUSNA2ITWIKNTRPH3XD4FWOF25W4PW0?paf_gear_id=9700020&itemId=106100975n&returnUrl=%2Fportal%2Fhome%3Bjsessionid%3DCYUSNA2ITWIKNTRPH3XD4FWOF25W4PW0|archive-date=February 3, 2012|access-date=2010-07-27|publisher=Mississauga.ca}}</ref>

==Transportation==

===Roads===
There are three main arterial east-west regional roads that run through urban Milton: [[List of numbered roads in Halton Region|Halton Regional Road #6]] or Britannia Road in the south, [[List of numbered roads in Halton Region|Halton Regional Road #7]] or Derry Road in central Milton, and [[List of numbered roads in Halton Region|Halton Regional Road #8]] or [[Steeles Avenue]] in the north. Three north-south regional roads bisect the town: [[List of numbered roads in Halton Region|Halton Regional Road #22]] or Tremaine Road in the west; [[List of numbered roads in Halton Region|Halton Regional Road #25]] or [[Ontario Highway 25|Highway 25]] as Ontario Street through the middle of town linking Milton to [[Acton, Ontario|Acton]] in the north and [[Bronte, Ontario|Bronte]] (Oakville) in the south; and [[List of numbered roads in Halton Region|Halton Regional Road #4]] or James Snow Parkway in the east. A number of improvements have been undertaken since 2009 to increase capacity and alleviate delays due to congestion and train traffic on these [[List of numbered roads in Halton Region|numbered regional roads]].

[[Highway 401]] bisects the Town and effectively separates the mainly rural and industrial areas to the north from the primarily residential and commercial developments in the southern part of town. The highway was to be widened to ten lanes from the James Snow Parkway to west of Regional Road 25, in a major project, starting in autumn 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.inhalton.com/401-expansion-will-impact-traffic-this-fall |title=Long Awaited Milton 401 Expansion Will Impact Traffic This Fall |date=26 September 2019 |publisher=InHalton |access-date=12 November 2019 }}</ref>

===Bridges===
A number of overpass and underpass projects have been constructed in recent years for the [[grade separation]] of railway crossings, including on Britannia Road, Derry Road, Main Street, and James Snow Parkway.<ref>{{cite web|title=Main Street Grade Separation|url=https://www.milton.ca/en/live/mainstreetunderpass.asp|publisher =Town of Milton |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019153701/http://www.milton.ca/en/live/mainstreetunderpass.asp|archive-date=19 October 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Underpass construction begins on Derry Road in Milton|url=http://webaps.halton.ca/news/mediashow.cfm?mediaid=2013-06-11-11-44-30| publisher =Halton Region|access-date=20 August 2017|date=11 June 2013}}</ref>

===Public transportation===

[[Milton Transit]] is the municipal provider of bus services for the town. Milton Transit provides conventional and Milton access+ ([[paratransit]]) service, operating on weekdays and Saturdays, with connections to routes and GO Transit services at the Milton GO Station.

Milton Transit has delivered service since the early 1980s in various forms. With recommendations from the North Halton Transit Strategy, Council approved the delivery of a contracted, fixed-route transit system in 2004. Milton Transit officially launched conventional service in August later that year and began purchasing its own branded buses in 2008.

Milton Transit service is provided by a private service provider under contract, PWTransit Canada, who employ bus operators and maintain Milton Transit fleet. Vehicles include 23 low floor buses for full accessibility. In 2018, the town cited 552,654 revenue passenger trips and approximately 400 active bus stops in the community.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.miltontransit.ca/en/connect-with-us/About-Us.asp|publisher=Milton Transit|access-date=12 November 2019}}</ref>

Intercity service is served by [[GO Transit]] via buses and trains. Commuter service to and from Toronto is the key routing, with some buses connecting to Oakville. On October 31, 2009, GO Transit started service with a line from [[Square One Shopping Centre]] in Mississauga to the [[University of Waterloo]], therefore allowing a trip to Kitchener and Cambridge.

===Railways===
{{See also|Milton line}}

Freight trains on the main Montreal-Toronto-Chicago CP line and a secondary CN line are a common sight in Milton. The town at present has very little passenger rail service in comparison to other GTA communities with only one-way, weekday peak-service inbound to Toronto in the morning, and outbound from Toronto in the evening. The nearest [[Via Rail]] station in the Toronto-New York City corridor is [[Oakville GO Station|Oakville station]].

The most easily accessible [[GO Transit]] railway station is [[Milton GO Station|Milton station]].

[[Canadian National Railway]] planned to build an "intermodal" or "truck-rail hub" facility on rural land in the south of the town (bordered by Tremaine Rd., Britannia Rd. and Lower Base Line) that would be used to transfer freight between trucks and trains. According to a late-July 2019 news report, the plan was controversial with "local mayors and residents voicing objections over potential congestion and environmental impacts" because of the "estimated 1,600 daily truck trips" that the facility would require. Public hearings had been completed by that time. A three person panel was to file its recommendations by early 2020 to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change.<ref>{{cite news|title=Proposed CN rail-truck hub in Milton sparks debate |date=25 July 2019|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2019/07/24/proposed-cn-rail-truck-hub-in-milton-sparks-debate.html|work=Toronto Star|access-date=12 November 2019|quote=A spokesperson for Halton Region said the municipalities are working together to help protect the communities’ interests in areas such as traffic congestion, health and safety, environment and employment. He said they also have concerns that in time, CN could double the size of the operation.}}</ref> Halton Region was also lobbying against the planned facility and stated another area of concern in late 2018:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.halton.ca/The-Region/Projects-and-Initiatives/CN-Milton-Logistics-Hub-Project|title=CN Milton Logistics Hub Project |date=14 December 2018 |publisher=Halton Region |access-date=13 November 2019 }}</ref><blockquote>Additionally, CN has only revealed its plans for 400 acres on the site; they have not disclosed its plans for the remaining 800 acres. We have determined that the operations at this site can be significantly expanded which will further increase the impacts on residents and the community.</blockquote>

===Air===
The nearest airport to Milton is the [[Burlington Airpark]] in neighboring [[Burlington, Ontario]]. It is a thriving [[general aviation|general-aviation]] field, but the airport does not have any regular commercial passenger flight service. Some charter operations are provided.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://search.hipinfo.info/record/BTN0032 |title=Burlington Executive Airpor |date=9 January 2019 |publisher=Halton Information Providers |access-date=12 November 2019 }}</ref>

[[Pearson International Airport]], Canada's largest passenger-volume airport, is located only {{convert|37|km|mi}} to the east. The much smaller [[John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport]] is located {{convert|53|km|mi}} from Milton.

==Development==
[[File:Derry and Thompson.JPG|right|thumb|300px|New developments near [[Derry Road]]]]
The town has very easy access throughout the [[Greater Toronto Area|GTA]] by [[Ontario Highway 401|Highways 401]] and [[Ontario Highway 407|407]] towards [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]], [[Burlington, Ontario|Burlington]] and [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] on the town, or by the former [[Ontario Highway 25|Highway 25]] (Halton Road 25). There are two key freight [[railway]] routes (both by [[Canadian National Railway|CN]] and [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CP]]), passenger services from GO Transit, and [[Via Rail]] passenger connections in the [[Quebec City–Windsor Corridor]] in both neighbouring [[Oakville, Ontario|Oakville]] and [[Georgetown, Ontario|Georgetown]]. There is close proximity to [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]] along Highway 401 (under 40&nbsp;km from 401/Halton 25 exit).

[[Milton Transit]] was developed in 1972 to provide public transportation service throughout the urban centre, as well as a feeder route for GO Transit trains and buses.

While most of the development is suburban in nature, larger industrial lots are being developed closer to the escarpment. The major industries in Milton are automotive, advanced manufacturing, distribution and food production.

The town published a Current Development Map and also a Future Urban Structure Map - Building Possibility document that indicates the general plan for the use of lands in future, intended to "minimize further expansion of urban areas and unnecessary and inefficient consumption of land".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.milton.ca/en/build/DevelopmentinMilton.asp |title=Development in Milton |publisher=Town of Milton |access-date=12 November 2019 }}</ref>

===1970s growth===
In 1978, the Ontario Municipal Board approved the Alliance Ex-Urban project, paving the way for a 532-unit plan, which broke ground with an initial 180 houses at Bronte St. and Derry Rd. in 1979.

A further 600 detached and semi-detached houses were completed in 1979, as Timberlea moved into phase two of its construction. Phase One saw 300 homes built in the Timberlea area bounded by Derry Rd., Thompson Rd. and Ontario St. S. The final Timberlea village includes 1,400 homes.

An additional 30 homes were built in 1979 by Kingsway Plastering on Commercial St, and 10 new units in Campbellville's McLaren Subdivision. A 107-unit apartment complex was also completed in 1979 on Millside Drive.

Building permit totals in 1976 reached $28 million, before dipping in 1977, and rebounding to nearly $23 million in 1978. In 1979, the estimated total building permit revenue reached $100 million.

By 1979, the town zoning administrator stated that, due to drinking water limitations at the time, completion of the Timberlea and Alliance projects would "complete all the residential development that can go into the town."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.milton.halinet.on.ca/2500966/page/7?n= |title=$100 million in housing planned for coming year |date=January 24, 1979 |page=5 |work=The Canadian Champion |access-date=July 19, 2019}}</ref> For the next 20 years, very little growth occurred in Milton.

===21st century===
Residential growth has increased substantially since 2002 due to completion of "The Big Pipe" project; designed to deliver water to the town from Lake Ontario. Since then, Milton developed an initial seven new subdivisions, including [[Hawthorne Village, Ontario|Hawthorne Village]], and several new ones are under development by Mattamy Homes and various other builders. Multiple new grade schools have been built, as well as the Crossroads Centre shopping plaza that includes various major retail stores and restaurants. An eight-screen movie theatre is operated by [[Cineplex Entertainment]] under their Galaxy Cinemas brand and opened on June 30, 2006.

In July 2014, Milton council approved 11 new residential applications that will see an additional 6,000 homes built, increasing the population by roughly 25,000 new residents. In 2013-14, Milton approved construction of a [[Track cycling|track-cycling]] velodrome venue for the [[2015 Pan American Games]] called the [[Mattamy National Cycling Centre]]. The facility sits at the heart of a 150-acre plot of land that is designated for a proposed future [[Wilfrid Laurier University]] campus.<ref name="thestar.com">{{cite web|last1=McKnight|first1=Zoe|title=Milton Mayor Gord Krantz poised to become the next Hazel McCallion| url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2014/08/24/milton_mayor_gord_krantz_poised_to_become_the_next_hazel_mccallion.html |website=Toronto Star|access-date=27 April 2016|date=24 August 2014}}</ref>

A mid 2019 report stated that roughly 3,100 high-density residential units were being planned or being built in the town.<ref name="EIR2019">{{cite web |url=http://www.milton.ca/en/build/resources/EconomicDevelopment/Economic-Insider-Report_2019_web.pdf |title=Economic Insider |date=June 20, 2019 |publisher=Town of Milton|access-date=November 13, 2019 }}</ref>

A mid-2019 report discussed two new subdivisions being planned, Agerton (along Trafalgar Road east of the 401), "for a mixed-use employment and higher-density residential community" and Trafalgar, a "mixed-use, transit-supportive, higher-density community ... along Trafalgar Road between Derry Road to south of Britannia Road". The {{convert|400|acre|ha|adj=on}} Milton Education Village area was to be further developed, as an urban neighbourhood with post-secondary education, residential, commercial and recreational segments.<ref name="EIR2019"/>

====Official Plan====
As of November 2019, the town was using the Official Plan approved by Halton Region on December 14, 1997, and by the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) on July 19, 1999. Public meetings were scheduled for late 2019 to obtain residents' comments on changes that might be appropriate for the next Official Plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.milton.ca/en/build/officialplan.asp|title=Official Plan |date=November 1, 2019 |publisher=Town of Milton |access-date=November 13, 2019 }}</ref>

==Commerce==
The villages of Milton Heights and Peru are unique in Milton, as they were the centres of industrial rather than farming communities. This has given this part of Milton a unique character that has left a legacy in the buildings and people that remain in the area. From the 1850s and '60s until 1877, a lumber mill operated in the area, as well as a saw mill in the mid-1800s. The railway fueled industry when it opened in 1879 in Milton.<ref name="HistoryMiltonHeights&Peru">{{cite web| author=The Corporation of the Town of Milton |title=Report : An outline of the history and characteristics of the Milton Heights and Peru Character Areas of Milton.|url=https://www.milton.ca/MeetingDocuments/Council/agendas2012/rpts2012/PD-027-12_AF_Background_report_-_character_of_Milton_Heights_May_22_Final%5B1%5D.pdf|publisher=Town of Milton|access-date=21 August 2017|date=28 May 2012}}</ref>

The area was traditionally famous for quarrying and the production of building materials such as lime, limestone and bricks, which started in the 1880s. These industries were of provincial significance and, at their peak at the turn of the 20th century, they employed hundreds of people in the Milton Heights and Peru areas.<ref name="HistoryMiltonHeights&Peru" />

In addition, the materials that were produced here were used in many of the buildings in both urban and rural Milton as well as in buildings throughout Ontario. These were huge industrial operations for their time and they attracted considerable immigration to Milton.<ref name="HistoryMiltonHeights&Peru" />

Early industry in Milton consisted of the Milton Pressed Brick Company, which started in the 1880s, and the P.L. Robertson screw factory, which started in 1908.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robertson Inc. : About Us|url=http://www.robertsonscrew.com/about.html|publisher=Robertson Inc.|access-date=21 August 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807094222/http://www.robertsonscrew.com/about.html|archive-date=7 August 2017|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

A 2017 summary of the benefits of Milton as a location for industry stated that the town's "proximity to the [[400-series highways]], rail links, and international airports, as well as the municipality's commitment to economic development, have all helped drive Milton's dynamic growth".<ref name="fast"/>

The town's mid-2019 report highlighted three major new facilities in Milton: Kimberly-Clark's {{convert|514,000|sqft|m2}} of warehouse and distribution, Prologis' {{convert|160,000|sqft|m2}} of warehouse space leased to Jaguar Land Rover and Sun Life Financial's planned {{convert|595,000|sqft|m2}} of speculative industrial building. At that time, the town had an inventory of {{convert|21,460,020|sqft|m2}} of industrial space, with only 2.7% being unoccupied.

The mid-2019 report also listed new businesses that had opened facilities in town in 2018: PBS Systems Group, Infrastructure Ontario, Enable Education, Responsive Consulting and Throwback Entertainment. At that time, the Derry Green Business Park Development was underway; the plan was "accommodate a mix of businesses including innovative logistics, advanced manufacturing and distribution facilities" in this new area.<ref name="EIR2019"/>

===Town finances===
The town's 2018 Budget report stated that gross revenue for 2018 was $187.2 million and that expenses totaled $118.1 million; much of the net revenue came from charges made to developers. Financial assets totaled $106.3 million at year's end, while liabilities totaled $12.6 million. Milton's long-term debenture debt decreased to $42.7 million.<ref name="townhall1">{{cite web |title=Budget 2018 |url=https://www.milton.ca/en/townhall/resources/Budget2018/2018-Financial-Report.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191112143331/https://www.milton.ca/en/townhall/resources/Budget2018/2018-Financial-Report.pdf |archive-date=November 12, 2019 |access-date=13 November 2019 |publisher=Town of Milton}}</ref>
