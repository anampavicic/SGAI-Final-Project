==History==

===Aulikaras of Dashapura===
Epigraphical discoveries have brought to light two ancient royal houses, who call themselves as [[Aulikaras]] and ruled from Dashapura (present-day Mandsaur). The first dynasty, who ruled from Dashapura from the beginning comprised the following kings in the order of succession: Jayavarma, Simhavarma, Naravarma, Vishvavarma and Bandhuvarma. The Risthal stone slab inscription discovered in 1983 has brought to light another Aulikara dynasty, which comprised the following kings in the order of succession: Drumavardhana, Jayavardhana Ajitavardhana, Vibhishanavardhana, Rajyavardhana and Prakashadharma. After Parakshadharma, the ruler of Mandsaur was [[Yashodharman|Yashodharma]], who is identified with Vishnuvardhana, who erected a pillar of victory at [[Bayana]] due to which Bayana's name became [[Vijaygarh]]. In all probabilities, he was the son and immediate successor of Prakashadharma.<ref>Agarwal, Ashvini (1989).

In February 1732, the Marathas completely surrounded Jai Singh with their enormous cavalry and started cutting of his supplies. The Jaipur Raja was forced to sue for peace, he offered the Marathas six lakhs, but [[House of Holkar|Holkar]] refused and demanded more. While the negotiations were taking place, a rumour surfaced about reinforcements from the emperor. This raised the morale of the [[Jaipur]] army and the [[Rajput]]s got ready for battle, the Marathas quickly attacked the rearguard of the Jaipur army and killed its commander. The Rajputs also attacked and killed fifteen Maratha officers in the fight that followed. Holkar and his men retreated 30 miles away from the battlefield. Jai Singh followed them but was outpaced by the [[Maratha Army|Maratha cavalry]] who reached Jai Singhs camp and forced him to surrender.<ref name=JP>{{Cite book|first=Jadunath|last=Sarkar|title=History of Jaipur: C. 1503-1938|publisher=Orient Longman|year=1984|isbn=9788125003335|pages=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O0oPIo9TXKcC&q=Malwa|access-date=2020-09-24}}</ref>
