'''Chillán''' ({{IPA|es|tʃiˈʝan}}) is the capital [[List of cities in Chile|city]] of [[Ñuble Region]], [[Diguillín Province]], [[Chile]], located about {{convert|400|km|0|abbr=on}} south of the country's capital, [[Santiago]],<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Chillán|volume=6|page=161}}</ref> near the center of the country. It has been the capital of the new [[Ñuble Region]] since 6 September 2015. Within the city is a railway station, an [[Intercity bus service|intercity bus]] terminal named María Teresa, and a regimental military base. The city features a modern, enclosed shopping centre in addition to the Chillán Market, an iconic multi-block, open-air [[farmers' market]] and street fair where fruits, vegetables, crafts, clothing and other goods are sold. The nearby mountains, such as in [[Laguna del Laja National Park]] ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Parque Nacional Laguna del Laja'') and the ''[[Nevados de Chillán]]'' ([[English language|English]]: 'snowy peaks of Chillán') are popular destinations for [[skiing]], hiking and [[hot spring|hot springs]].

Founded by the [[Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire|Spanish]] in 1580, the city withstood numerous early attacks by the indigenous [[Mapuche]] and [[Pehuenche]], among other peoples, who were vehemently [[Arauco War|opposed to Spanish colonialism]]. Over time, Chillán became an important marketplace and meeting-point for the descendants of these Mapuche and Pehuenche, along with [[Mestizo]]s and [[Criollo people|Criollos]], to meet. Many goods from [[Patagonia]] and the [[Pampas|Argentine Pampas]] were brought into Chillán across the mountain passes of the area. In the early 19th century, the countryside of Chillán was ravaged by the [[Chilean War of Independence]] and a subsequent [[banditry in Chile|banditry epidemic]].<ref>[[Sergio Villalobos|Villalobos, Sergio]]; [[Osvaldo Silva|Silva, Osvaldo]]; Silva, Fernando; Estelle, Patricio (1974). ''Historia De Chile'' (14th ed.). [[Editorial Universitaria]]. {{ISBN|956-11-1163-2}}, pp. 406–413</ref> In 1939, the city was devastated by [[1939 Chillán earthquake|a large earthquake]], prompting the government to initiate an extensive reconstruction program.

==History==

The zone where Chillán was built was previously inhabited by indigenous people called [[Chiquillanes]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.icarito.cl/enciclopedia/articulo/primer-ciclo-basico/historia-geografia-y-ciencias-sociales/identidad-y-diversidad-cultural/2009/12/45-5015-9-chiquillanes-pehuenches-y-tehuelches.shtml |title=- Chiquillanes, pehuenches y tehuelches, pueblos aborígenes chilenos |access-date=2016-02-02 |archive-date=2015-10-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020120426/http://www.icarito.cl/enciclopedia/articulo/primer-ciclo-basico/historia-geografia-y-ciencias-sociales/identidad-y-diversidad-cultural/2009/12/45-5015-9-chiquillanes-pehuenches-y-tehuelches.shtml |url-status=dead }}</ref>

According to Friar [[Ernesto Wilhelm de Moesbach]] Chillán is etymologically derived from "chilla", an indigenous word for the [[South American gray fox]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Voz de Arauco |last=de Moesbach |first=Ernesto Wilhelm |publisher=Ceibo |year=2016 |isbn=978-956-359-051-7 |location=Santiago |pages=56 |language=Spanish |orig-date=1944}}</ref>

Chillán was founded in 1580 at the site of [[Chillán Viejo]] as '''San Bartolomé de Chillán''' by [[Martín Ruiz de Gamboa]],<ref>[http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-3334.html - El destino infausto de una ciudad]</ref>
who was campaigning against the local indigenous peoples at the time, but this moniker did not fare well, and was replaced by the current name, which in the local Indian language means "where the Sun is sitting".

During the [[Mapuche uprising of 1655]], the city was besieged by Mapuche warriors.<ref name=barana352>Barros Arana 2000, p. 352.</ref> The Spanish defended the city from trenches and a palisade fort.<ref name=barana352/><ref name=barana357>Barros Arana 2000, p. 357.</ref> Hoping for a miracle, the Spaniards put an image of Mary near the trenches, against which Mapuches are said to have shot arrows.<ref name=barana352/> In early March, about one month after the onset of uprising, distress was such that the Spaniards abandoned the city and headed north, escaping the conflict zone.<ref name=barana357/> The [[Real Audiencia of Santiago]] declared the evacuation an act of cowardice, and prohibited refugees from Chillán to go beyond the [[Maule River]] north.<ref name=barana360>Barros Arana 2000, p. 360.</ref> As an outbreak of [[smallpox]] occurred among the refugees, this was. in effect. a quarantine, as trespassing north was punished with death sentences.<ref name=barana360/>

From its foundation, Chillán has been at the heart of Chile's rich agricultural region. It is also in a region of seismic activity, suffering from devastating earthquakes throughout its history; the [[1939 Chillán earthquake]] left over 30,000 dead and mobilized international help.

Chile's [[List of national founders|founding father]], [[Bernardo O'Higgins]], was born in Chillán in 1778. He was the force behind [[Chilean War of Independence|Chile's Independence]] from [[Spain]], being elected [[President of Chile|supreme director]] and declaring independence after the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] against the Spaniards in 1817. His later victory at the [[Battle of Maipú|Maipo]] battlefield cemented the country's freedom. He died in exile in [[Peru]] in 1842.

The air in Chillán is the fourth-most polluted in Chile, after [[Santiago]], [[Temuco]], and [[Concepción, Chile|Concepción]]. "As in Temuco, the main cause of air pollution in Chillán is the use of wood-burning stoves; about 62% of all households in Chillán use firewood as their main source of heating."<ref>[http://en.mercopress.com/2007/06/29/severe-air-pollution-plagues-chilean-cities Severe air pollution plagues Chilean cities] Friday, June 29th 2007 - 21:00 UTC</ref>

==Demographics==
According to the 2002 [[census]] by the [[National Statistics Institute (Chile)|National Statistics Institute]], the commune of Chillán spans an area of {{convert|511.2|sqkm|0|abbr=on}} and has 161,953 inhabitants (77,007 men and 84,946 women). Of these, 148,015 (91.4%) lived in [[urban area]]s and 13,938 (8.6%) in [[rural area]]s. The population grew by 8.3% (12,442 persons) between the 1992 and 2002 censuses.<ref name="INE"/>

The [[demonym]] for a person from Chillán, used for more than 400 years by local residents, is ''Chillanejo'', yet this is not found in the Royal Spanish Academy Dictionary, which only recognizes ''Chillanense''.<ref>[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&LEMA=chillanense Chillanense - DRAE (Royal Spanish Academy Dictionary)]</ref>

===Notable people===
[[File:Claudio Arrau 1 Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|Claudio Arrau in 1974, by [[Allan Warren]]]]
[[Isabel Riquelme]], mother of Chilean independence leader Bernardo O'Higgins, was born in Chillán in 1758. [[María Cornelia Olivares]], one of the national heroines of the [[Chilean War of Independence]], was also from the city. In addition, Chillán has produced a number of artists. A notable example is [[Claudio Arrau]], a [[pianist]].  Additionally, [[Ramón Vinay]] is the tenor who played [[Otello]] in the 1950s, his recording of the role with Toscanini. He was a regular at the New York City [[Metropolitan Opera]], where he sang both tenor and baritone roles. One of his last performances at this house was as the [[Barber of Seville]]'s Basilio, a bass role. He retired from the stage in 1969.

Other "Chillanejos" include writer [[Marta Brunet]],  sculptor [[Marta Colvin]],  painter [[Pacheco Altamirano]], and [[Juan de Dios Aldea]], who, however, did not reach the international acclaim achieved by Arrau and Vinay. ''[[Super Smash Bros.]]'' player [[Gonzalo "ZeRo" Barrios]] who had a record-breaking 56-tournament winning streak is also from Chillán.

==Administration==
As a commune, Chillán is a third-level [[administrative division of Chile]] administered by a [[municipal council]], headed by an ''[[alcalde]]'', who is directly elected every four years. The 2008-2020 ''alcalde'' is [[Sergio Zarzar Andonie]] (ILE).<ref name="Official"/><ref name="Munitel"/>

Within the [[electoral divisions of Chile]], Chillán is represented in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Chile|Chamber of Deputies]] by Carlos Abel Jarpa  ([[Social Democrat Radical Party|PRSD]]) and Rosauro Martínez ([[National Renewal (Chile)|RN]]) as part of the 41st electoral district, together with [[Coihueco]], [[Pinto, Chile|Pinto]], [[San Ignacio, Chile|San Ignacio]], [[El Carmen, Chile|El Carmen]], [[Pemuco]], [[Yungay, Chile|Yungay]] and [[Chillán Viejo]]. The commune is represented in the [[Senate of Chile|Senate]] by Victor Pérez Varela ([[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]) and [[Felipe Harboe]] ([[Party for Democracy (Chile)|PPD]]) as part of the 13th senatorial constituency (Biobío-Coast).

==Transport==
The city of Chillán is connected to Chile's capital Santiago by both a modern highway and a rebuilt railway system [[TerraSur]] that makes the trip in less than five hours. TerraSur, which terminates in Chillán station, and the [[Alameda railway station | Alameda-Temuco train]] both operate on the railway connecting Chillan with [[Rancagua]] and [[Santiago]].
