The province comprises the island of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] and the continental region of [[Labrador]], having a total size of {{cvt|405,212|km2}}.  As of 2024 the population of Newfoundland and Labrador was estimated to be 545,247.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Department of Finance |date=January 1, 2024 |title=People |url=https://www.gov.nl.ca/fin/economics/eb-population/ |access-date=April 24, 2024 |archive-date=March 29, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240329051247/https://www.gov.nl.ca/fin/economics/eb-population/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The island of Newfoundland (and its smaller neighbouring islands) is home to around 94 per cent of the province's population, with more than half residing in the [[Avalon Peninsula]]. Labrador has a land border with both the province of [[Quebec]], as well as a short border with the territory of [[Nunavut]] on [[Killiniq Island]]. The French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] lies about {{cvt|20|km}} west of the [[Burin Peninsula]].

According to the 2016 census, 97.0% of residents reported English as their native language, making Newfoundland and Labrador Canada's most linguistically homogeneous province. Much of the population is descended from English and Irish settlers, with the majority immigrating from the early 17th century to the late 19th century.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Handcock |first1=Gordon |title=English |url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/english.php |website=Heritage: Newfoundland and Labrador |access-date=2 September 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Mannion |first1=John |title=The Irish in Newfoundland |url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/irish-newfoundland.php |website=Heritage: Newfoundland and Labrador |access-date=2 September 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Handcock |first1=Gordon |title=The West Country |url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/west-country.php |website=Heritage: Newfoundland and Labrador |access-date=3 September 2024}}</ref>
[[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], the capital and largest city of Newfoundland and Labrador, is Canada's 22nd-largest [[Census geographic units of Canada|census metropolitan area]] and home to about 40% of the province's population. St. John's is the seat of the [[House of Assembly of Newfoundland and Labrador]] as well as the province's highest court, the [[Newfoundland and Labrador Court of Appeal]].

Until 1949, the [[Dominion of Newfoundland]] was a separate [[dominion]] in the British Empire. In 1933, the House of Assembly of the self-governing dominion voted to dissolve itself and to hand over administration of Newfoundland and Labrador to the British-appointed [[Newfoundland Commission of Government|Commission of Government]]. This followed the suffering caused by the [[Great Depression]] and Newfoundland's participation in the [[First World War]]. On March 31, 1949, it became the 10th and most recent province to join the Canadian Confederation as "Newfoundland". On December 6, 2001, the [[Constitution of Canada]] was amended to [[geographical renaming|change the province's name]] from "Newfoundland" to "Newfoundland and Labrador".
{{TOC limit|3}}

==Names==
The name "New founde lande" was uttered by [[King Henry VII]] about the land explored by [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian]] and [[John Cabot]]. In [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], it is {{lang|pt|Terra Nova}} (while the province's full name is {{lang|pt|Terra Nova e Labrador}}), which literally means "new land" and is also the French name for the province's island region ({{lang|fr|Terre-Neuve}}). The name "Terra Nova" is in wide use on the island (e.g. [[Terra Nova National Park]]). The influence of early Portuguese exploration is also reflected in the name of Labrador, which derives from the surname of the [[History of Portugal (1415–1578)#Chronology of the Portuguese discoveries|Portuguese navigator]] [[João Fernandes Lavrador]].<ref>Hamilton, William B. (1978): ''The Macmillan book of Canadian place names'', Macmillan of Canada, Toronto, p. 105.</ref>

Labrador's name in the [[Inuttitut]]/[[Inuktitut]] language (spoken in [[Nunatsiavut]]) is {{lang|iu-Latn|Nunatsuak}} ({{Lang|iu|ᓄᓇᑦᓱᐊᒃ}}), meaning "the big land" (a common English nickname for Labrador<ref>{{Cite web |title=Four of the best places to visit in The Big Land |url=https://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/trip-ideas/travel-stories/four-of-the-best-places-to-visit-in-the-big-land |access-date=June 18, 2022 |website=Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada – Official Tourism Website |language=en |archive-date=June 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210625073039/https://www.newfoundlandlabrador.com/trip-ideas/travel-stories/four-of-the-best-places-to-visit-in-the-big-land |url-status=live }}</ref>). Newfoundland's Inuttitut/Inuktitut name is {{lang|iu-Latn|Ikkarumikluak}} ({{Lang|iu|ᐃᒃᑲᕈᒥᒃᓗᐊᒃ}}), meaning "place of many shoals". Newfoundland and Labrador's Inuttitut / Inuktitut name is ''{{lang|iu-Latn|Ikkarumikluak aamma Nunatsuak}}''.

'''{{lang|fr|Terre-Neuve-et-Labrador}}''' is the French name used in the Constitution of Canada. However, [[French language in Canada|French]] is not widely spoken in Newfoundland and Labrador and is not an official language at the provincial level.

On April 29, 1999, the government of [[Brian Tobin]] passed a motion in the [[Newfoundland House of Assembly]] requesting the federal government amend the ''[[Newfoundland Act]]'' to change the province's name to "Newfoundland and Labrador". A resolution approving the name change was put forward in the [[Canadian House of Commons|House of Commons]] in October 2001, introduced by Tobin who had moved to federal politics. Tobin's successor as premier [[Roger Grimes]] stated: "The Government of Newfoundland and Labrador is firmly committed to ensuring official recognition of Labrador as an equal partner in this province, and a constitutional name change of our province will reiterate that commitment".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.releases.gov.nl.ca/releases/2001/exec/1026n03.htm|title=Federal government moves forward with province's request for provincial name change|publisher=Government of Newfoundland and Labrador|date=26 October 2001|access-date=3 December 2023|archive-date=December 2, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231202223334/https://www.releases.gov.nl.ca/releases/2001/exec/1026n03.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> Following approval by the House of Commons and the Senate, Governor-General [[Adrienne Clarkson]] officially proclaimed the name change on December 6, 2001.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-s-name-change-now-official-1.279040|title=Newfoundland's name change now official|publisher=CBC News|date=6 December 2001|access-date=3 December 2023|archive-date=October 30, 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231030230839/https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-s-name-change-now-official-1.279040|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] represents the east coast, [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]] the interior of the island, [[Corner Brook]] the west coast of the island and [[Wabush, Newfoundland and Labrador|Wabush]] the interior of Labrador. Climate data for 56 places in the province is available from [[Environment Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/stnselect_1981_2010_e.html?lang=e&province=NL&provSubmit=go|title=Station Results – 1981–2010 Climate Normals and Averages|publisher=Environment Canada|access-date=May 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316212407/http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/stnselect_1981_2010_e.html?lang=e&province=NL&provSubmit=go|archive-date=March 16, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The data for the graphs is the average over 30 years. Error bars on the temperature graph indicate the range of daytime highs and night time lows. Snowfall is the total amount that fell during the month, not the amount accumulated on the ground.

The Maritime Archaic peoples were gradually displaced by people of the [[Dorset culture]] (Late [[Paleo-Eskimo]]) who also occupied Port au Choix. The number of their sites discovered on Newfoundland indicates they may have been the most numerous Aboriginal people to live there. They thrived from about 2000 BC to 800 AD. Many of their sites were on exposed [[headland]]s and outer islands. They were more oriented to the sea than earlier peoples, and had developed sleds and boats similar to [[kayak]]s. They burned seal [[blubber]] in soapstone lamps.<ref name="pastore">[http://www.heritage.nf.ca/aboriginal/palaeo.html Ralph T.

<blockquote>Many of these sites, such as [[Port au Choix]], recently excavated by Memorial archaeologist, Priscilla Renouf, are quite large and show evidence of a long-term commitment to place. Renouf has excavated huge amounts of [[harp seal]] bones at Port au Choix, indicating that this place was a prime location for the hunting of these animals.<ref name="pastore"/></blockquote>

The people of the Dorset culture (800 BC – 1500 AD) were highly adapted to a cold climate, and much of their food came from hunting sea mammals through holes in the ice.<ref name="Wonders">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PHsyINzEEgEC&pg=PA88|pages=88–89|title=Canada's Changing North|first=William C|last=Wonders|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7735-2590-0|access-date=May 23, 2022|archive-date=May 23, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220523120626/https://books.google.com/books?id=PHsyINzEEgEC&pg=PA88|url-status=live}}</ref> The massive decline in sea ice during the [[Medieval Warm Period]] would have had a devastating effect upon their way of life.<ref name="Wonders"/>

The inhabitants eventually organized themselves into small [[Band society|bands]] of a few families, grouped into larger [[tribe]]s and [[chieftainship]]s. The [[Innu]] are the inhabitants of an area they refer to as ''[[Nitassinan]]'', i.e. most of what is now referred to as northeastern [[Quebec]] and Labrador. Their subsistence activities were historically centered on hunting and trapping [[caribou]], [[deer]] and small game.<ref name="Luebering">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bnabh4i3ppMC&q=Innu+traditional+diet&pg=PA37|page=37|title=Native American History|publisher=Educational Britannica Educational|first=J E|last=Luebering|year=2011|isbn=978-1-61530-265-9|access-date=November 18, 2020|archive-date=August 14, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210814103130/https://books.google.com/books?id=Bnabh4i3ppMC&q=Innu+traditional+diet&pg=PA37|url-status=live}}</ref> Coastal clans also practiced agriculture, fished and managed [[maple sugar]] bush.<ref name="Luebering"/> The Innu engaged in tribal warfare along the coast of Labrador with Inuit groups that had large populations.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkAuYRVjlE8C&q=Innu%20and%20Inuit%20warfare&pg=PA102|page=102|title=Aboriginal peoples of Canada: a short introduction|first=Paul R|last=Magocsi|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=2002|isbn=978-0-8020-3630-8|access-date=November 18, 2020|archive-date=August 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815022128/https://books.google.com/books?id=GkAuYRVjlE8C&q=Innu%20and%20Inuit%20warfare&pg=PA102|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Miꞌkmaq]] of southern Newfoundland spent most of their time on the shores harvesting seafood; during the winter they would move inland to the woods to hunt.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-PRUMG5Ukx4C&q=Mi'kmaq&pg=PA4|page=4|title=Mi'kmaq landscapes: from animism to sacred ecology|first=Anne-Christine|last=Hornborg|publisher=Burlington, VT : Ashgate|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7546-6371-3|access-date=July 16, 2022|archive-date=August 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816163958/https://books.google.com/books?id=-PRUMG5Ukx4C&q=Mi%27kmaq&pg=PA4|url-status=live}}</ref> Over time, the Miꞌkmaq and Innu divided their lands into traditional "districts".

==== European contact ====
[[File:Beothuk camp.jpg|thumb|A [[Beothuk]] encampment in Newfoundland, {{circa|18th century}}]]
By the time European contact with Newfoundland began in the early 16th century, the Beothuk were the only indigenous group living permanently on the island.<ref name="Marshall"/> Unlike other groups in the Northeastern area of the Americas, the [[Beothuk]] never established sustained trading relations with European settlers. Their interactions were sporadic, and they largely attempted to avoid contact.<ref name="Beothuk Eve of Extinction">{{cite journal|last1=Holly|first1=Donald H. Jr.|title=The Beothuk on the Eve of Their Extinction|journal=Arctic Anthropology|date=2000|volume=37|issue=1|pages=79–95|pmid=17722364}}</ref> The establishment of English fishing operations on the outer coastline of the island, and their later expansion into bays and inlets, cut off access for the Beothuk to their traditional sources of food.<ref name="Timothy Severin 1977 p. 768-97">Timothy Severin, "The Voyage of the 'Brendan'", ''National Geographic Magazine'', 152: 6 (December 1977), p. 768-97.</ref><ref name="Tim Severin 1978">Tim Severin, ''The Brendan Voyage: A Leather Boat Tracks the Discovery of America by the Irish Sailor Saints'', McGraw-Hill Book Company, 1978, {{ISBN|0-07-056335-7}}.</ref><ref name="voices.nationalgeographic.com">Tim Severin, "Atlantic Navigators:  The Brendan Voyage", 2005 presentation at Gresham College, [https://web.archive.org/web/20150210223018/http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2013/05/16/did-st-brendan-reach-north-america-500-years-before-the-vikings/ video posted on ''National Geographic Voices'' by Andrew Howley May 16, 2013].</ref>

In the 18th century, as the Beothuk were driven further inland by these encroachments, violence between Beothuk and settlers escalated, with each retaliating against the other in their competition for resources. By the early 19th century, violence, starvation, and exposure to [[tuberculosis]] had decimated the Beothuk population, and they were extinct by 1829.<ref name="Marshall"/>

The oldest confirmed accounts of European contact date from a thousand years ago as described in the [[Viking]] (Norse) [[Icelandic Sagas]]. Around the year 1001, the sagas refer to [[Leif Erikson]] landing in three places to the west,<ref name="Pálsson 1965 28">{{cite book

In 1496, [[John Cabot]] obtained a charter from English [[King Henry VII]] to "sail to all parts, countries and seas of the East, the West and of the North, under our banner and ensign and to set up our banner on any new-found-land" and on June 24, 1497, landed in [[Cape Bonavista]]. Historians disagree on whether Cabot landed in [[Nova Scotia]] in 1497 or in Newfoundland, or possibly Maine, if he landed at all, but the governments of Canada and the United Kingdom recognise Bonavista as being Cabot's "official" landing place. In 1499 and 1500, Portuguese mariners [[João Fernandes Lavrador]] and [[Pero de Barcelos]] explored and mapped the coast, the former's name appearing as "Labrador" on topographical maps of the period.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vtZtMBLJ7GgC&q=The%20name%20%22Labrador%22%20and%20Jo%C3%A3o%20Fernandes%20Lavrador&pg=PA464 |title=Foundations of the Portuguese empire |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |author1=Bailey W.

===European settlement and conflict ===
{{Main|Newfoundland Colony|Terre-Neuve (New France)}}

Sometime before 1563, [[Basque people|Basque]] fishermen, who had been fishing [[cod]] shoals off Newfoundland's coasts since the beginning of the sixteenth century, founded Plaisance (today [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|Placentia]]), a seasonal haven which French fishermen later used. In the Newfoundland [[Will and testament|will]] of the Basque seaman Domingo de Luca, dated 1563 and now in an archive in Spain, he asks "that my body be buried in this port of Plazençia in the place where those who die here are usually buried". This will is the oldest-known civil document written in Canada.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://canadashistory.ca/Community/Community-Features/Articles/Basque-Will |title=The 1563 Basque Will |last=Dawson |first=Joanna |website=canadahistory.ca |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301144128/http://canadashistory.ca/Community/Community-Features/Articles/Basque-Will |archive-date=March 1, 2017 |url-status=dead |access-date=July 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.placentiahistory.ca/images/pdfs/Basque_will_translation_PDF.pdf |title=The Oldest Original Civil Document Written in Canada: The Last Will of Basque Sailor Domingo de Luca a, Placentia, Newfoundland, 1563 |last=Barkham |first=Michael M. |website=placentia.ca |access-date=July 1, 2018 |archive-date=March 16, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316062025/http://placentiahistory.ca/images/pdfs/Basque_will_translation_PDF.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>
[[Image:Gilbert plaque.jpg|thumb|upright|Plaque in [[St. John's, Newfoundland|St. John's]] commemorating the English claim over Newfoundland, and the beginning of the British overseas empire]]
Twenty years later, in 1583, Newfoundland became England's first possession in North America and one of the earliest permanent English colonies in the New World<ref>{{cite book |title= Sir Francis Drake |last= Sugden |first= John |year= 1990 |publisher= Barrie & Jenkins |isbn= 978-0-7126-2038-3 |page= 118 }}</ref> when Sir [[Humphrey Gilbert]] claimed it for [[Elizabeth I]]. European fishing boats had visited Newfoundland continuously since Cabot's second voyage in 1498 and seasonal fishing camps had existed for a century prior. Fishing boats originated from Basque country, England, France, and Portugal.

In 1585, during the initial stages of [[Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)|Anglo-Spanish War]], [[Bernard Drake]] led a [[Newfoundland expedition (1585)|devastating raid]] on the Spanish and Portuguese fisheries. This provided an opportunity to secure the island and led to the appointment of [[Proprietary Governor]]s to establish colonial settlements on the island from 1610 to 1728. [[John Guy (colonial administrator)|John Guy]] became [[List of Newfoundland and Labrador lieutenant-governors|governor]] of the first settlement at [[Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland and Labrador|Cuper's Cove]]. Other settlements included [[Bristol's Hope]], [[Renews]], [[New Cambriol]], [[South Falkland]] and [[Province of Avalon|Avalon]] (which became a province in 1623). The first governor given jurisdiction over all of Newfoundland was Sir [[David Kirke]] in 1638.

Explorers quickly realized the waters around Newfoundland had the best fishing in the North Atlantic.<ref>Grant C. Head, ''Eighteenth Century Newfoundland: A Geographer's Perspective'' (1976)</ref>{{request quotation|date=November 2016}} By 1620, 300 fishing boats worked the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland|Grand Banks]], employing some 10,000 sailors; many continuing to come from the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], Normandy, or Brittany. They dried and salted [[cod]] on the coast and sold it to Spain and Portugal. Heavy investment by Sir [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]], in the 1620s in wharves, warehouses, and fishing stations failed to pay off. French raids hurt the business, and the weather was terrible, so he redirected his attention to his [[History of Maryland|other colony in Maryland]].<ref>{{cite DCB |first= Allan M. |last= Fraser |title= Calvert, Sir George |volume= 1 |url= http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/calvert_george_1E.html}}</ref> After Calvert left, small-scale entrepreneurs such as Sir David Kirke made good use of the facilities.<ref>Compare: {{cite DCB |first=John S. |last=Moir |title=Kirke, Sir David |volume=1 |url=http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/kirke_david_1E.html | quote = In 1639 Sir David, as the first governor of Newfoundland, took possession of Baltimore's "Mansion House" and the other property at Ferryland.}}</ref> Kirke became the first governor of Newfoundland in 1638.

==== Triangular Trade ====

A [[triangular trade]] with New England, the West Indies, and Europe gave Newfoundland an important economic role.<ref name="Pope, Peter Edward 2004">{{cite book |last=Pope |first=Peter Edward |date=2004 |title=Fish into Wine: the Newfoundland Plantation in the Seventeenth Century |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=University of North Carolina Press}}</ref> By the 1670s, there were 1,700 permanent residents and another 4,500 in the summer months.<ref>Gordon W.

In 1655, France appointed a governor in Plaisance (Placentia), the former Basque fishing settlement, thus starting a formal French colonization period in Newfoundland<ref>{{cite web|url= http://collections.mun.ca/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/hist_trust&CISOPTR=242&CISOSHOW=123&REC=5|title= History of Placentia|publisher= Memorial University of Newfoundland|access-date= February 26, 2010|archive-date= October 25, 2011|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111025190440/http://collections.mun.ca/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=%2Fhist_trust&CISOPTR=242&CISOSHOW=123&REC=5|url-status= live}}</ref> as well as a period of periodic war and unrest between England and France in the region. The Miꞌkmaq, as allies of the French, were amenable to limited French settlement in their midst and fought alongside them against the English. English attacks on Placentia provoked retaliation by [[New France]] explorer [[Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville]] who during [[King William's War]] in the 1690s, destroyed nearly every English settlement on the island. The entire population of the English colony was either killed, captured for ransom, or sentenced to expulsion to England, with the exception of those who withstood the attack at [[Carbonear Island]] and those in the then remote [[Bonavista, Newfoundland and Labrador|Bonavista]].

After France lost political control of the area after the [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Siege of Port Royal in 1710]], the Miꞌkmaq engaged in warfare with the British throughout [[Dummer's War]] (1722–1725), [[King George's War]] (1744–1748), [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749–1755) and the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–1763). The French colonization period lasted until the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] of 1713, which ended the [[War of the Spanish Succession]]: France ceded to the British its claims to Newfoundland (including its claims to the shores of [[Hudson Bay]]) and to the French possessions in [[Acadia]]. Afterward, under the supervision of the last French governor, the French population of Plaisance moved to Île Royale (now [[Cape Breton Island]]), part of Acadia which remained then under French control.

In the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] (1713), France had acknowledged British ownership of the island. However, in the [[Seven Years' War]] (1756–1763), control of Newfoundland once again became a major source of conflict between Britain, France and Spain, who all pressed for a share in the valuable fishery there. [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's victories around the globe]] led [[William Pitt, 1st Earl of Chatham|William Pitt]] to insist nobody other than Britain should have access to Newfoundland. The [[Battle of Signal Hill]] was fought on September 15, 1762, and was the last battle of the North American theatre of the [[Seven Years' War]]. A British force under Lieutenant Colonel [[William Amherst (British Army officer)|William Amherst]] recaptured [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]],<ref>{{London Gazette
| issue = 10251
| date = October 9, 1762

}}</ref> which the French had seized three months earlier in a surprise attack.

[[File:Vue de la descente a Terre Neuve par le chevalier de Ternay en 1762.jpg|thumb|A French invasion of the Newfoundland was repulsed during the [[Battle of Signal Hill]] in 1762.]]

From 1763 to 1767, [[James Cook]] made a detailed survey of the coasts of Newfoundland and southern Labrador while commander of {{HMS|Grenville|1754|6}}. (The following year, 1768, Cook began [[First voyage of James Cook|his first circumnavigation of the world]].) In 1796, a Franco-Spanish expedition again [[Newfoundland expedition|succeeded in raiding]] the coasts of Newfoundland and Labrador, destroying many of the settlements.

By the Treaty of Utrecht (1713), French fishermen gained the right to land and cure fish on the "French Shore" on the western coast. (They had a permanent base on the nearby [[St. Pierre and Miquelon]] islands; the French gave up their French Shore rights in 1904.) In 1783, the British signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] with the United States that gave American fishermen similar rights along the coast. These rights were reaffirmed by treaties in 1818, 1854 and 1871, and confirmed by arbitration in 1910.

==== The United Irish Conspiracy and Catholic Emancipation ====
The founding proprietor of the [[Province of Avalon]], [[George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore]], intended that it should serve as a refuge for his persecuted Roman Catholic co-religionists. But like his other colony in the [[Province of Maryland]] on the American mainland, it soon passed out of the Calvert family's control. The majority Catholic population that developed, thanks to [[Irish language in Newfoundland|Irish immigration]], in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]] and the [[Avalon Peninsula]], was subjected to same disabilities that applied elsewhere under the British Crown. On visiting St. John's in 1786, Prince William Henry (the future [[King William IV]]) noted that "there are ten Roman Catholics to one Protestant",<ref>[https://www.mun.ca/rels/ang/texts/pwh.htm Memorial University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110015234/http://www.mun.ca/rels/ang/texts/pwh.htm |date=January 10, 2011 }}, Note 87: PWH to King, September 21, 1786, Later Correspondence of George III, Vol. 1, 251.</ref> and he counselled against any measure of Catholic relief.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rollman |first=Hans |date=1986 |title=Prince William in Newfoundland |url=http://www.mun.ca/rels/ang/texts/pwh.htm |website=Religion Society and Culture: The Newfoundland and Labrador pages of Dr Hans Rollman, Memorial University, Newfoundland |access-date=July 16, 2022 |archive-date=January 10, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110110015234/http://www.mun.ca/rels/ang/texts/pwh.htm }}</ref>

Following news of [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|rebellion in Ireland]], in June 1798, Governor Vice-Admiral [[William Waldegrave, 1st Baron Radstock|Waldegrave]] cautioned London that the English constituted but a "small proportion" of the locally raised [[Royal Newfoundland Regiment|Regiment of Foot]]. In an echo of an earlier Irish conspiracy during the French occupation of St. John's in 1762, in April 1800, the authorities had reports that upwards of 400 men had taken an oath as [[Society of United Irishmen|United Irishmen]], and that eighty soldiers were committed to killing their officers and seizing their [[Anglican]] governors at Sunday service.<ref name="mannion">{{Cite journal|last=Mannion|first=John|date=January 1, 2000|title="...

When news reached Newfoundland in May 1829 that the UK Parliament had finally conceded [[Catholic emancipation]], the locals assumed that Catholics would now pass unhindered into the ranks of public office and enjoy equality with Protestants. There was a celebratory parade and mass in St. John's, and a gun salute from vessels in the harbour. But the attorney general and supreme court justices determined that as Newfoundland was a colony, and not a province of the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829|Roman Catholic Relief Act]] did not apply. The discrimination was a matter of local ordinance.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Fitzgerald |first=John Edward |title=Newfoundland and Daniel O'Connell |url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/daniel-oconnell.php |access-date=April 22, 2022 |website=heritage.nf.ca |archive-date=November 12, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112040237/https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/daniel-oconnell.php |url-status=live }}</ref>

It was not until May 1832 that the British [[Secretary of State for the Colonies]] formally stated that a new commission would be issued to [[Thomas John Cochrane|Governor Cochrane]] to remove any and all [[Roman Catholic disabilities]] in Newfoundland.<ref>John P. Greene (1999), ''Between Damnation and Starvation: Priests and Merchants in Newfoundland Politics, 1745–1855,'' McGill-Queen's University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7735-1880-3}}.</ref> By then Catholic emancipation was bound up (as in Ireland) with the call for [[home rule]].

==== Achievement of home rule ====
After the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815, France and other nations re-entered the fish trade and an abundance of cod glutted international markets. Prices dropped, competition increased, and the colony's profits evaporated. A string of harsh winters between 1815 and 1817 made living conditions even more difficult, while fires at St. John's in 1817 left thousands homeless.<ref>{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Jenny|date=2009|title=Reform Movement|url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/reform-movement.php|url-status=live|website=Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage|access-date=March 12, 2021|archive-date=June 19, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210619072255/https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/reform-movement.php}}</ref> At the same time a new wave of immigration from Ireland increased the Catholic population. In these circumstances much of the English and Protestant proprietor class tended to shelter behind the appointed, and Anglican, "naval government".<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal|last=Thomsen|first=Robert Chr.|date=2005|title=Democracy, Sectarianism and Denomi(-)nationalism: The Irish in Newfoundland|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/30001517|journal=Nordic Irish Studies|volume=4|pages=13–27, 16|jstor=30001517|issn=1602-124X|access-date=March 12, 2021|archive-date=August 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210815134056/https://www.jstor.org/stable/30001517|url-status=live}}</ref>

A broad home-rule coalition of Irish community leaders and ([[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]]) [[Methodists]] formed in 1828. Expressing, initially, the concerns of a new middle class over taxation, it was led by William Carson, a Scottish physician, and Patrick Morris, an Irish merchant. In 1825, the British government granted Newfoundland and Labrador official colonial status and appointed Sir Thomas Cochrane as its first civil governor. Partly carried by the wave of reform in Britain, a colonial legislature in St. John's, together with the promise of Catholic emancipation, followed in 1832. Carson made his goal for Newfoundland clear: "We shall rise into a national existence, having a national character, a nation's feelings, assuming that rank among our neighbours which the political situation and the extent of our island demand".<ref name=":1"/>

Standing as [[Liberal Party of Newfoundland and Labrador|Liberals]], the reformers sought to break the Anglican monopoly on government patronage and to tax the fisheries to fund the judiciary, road-building projects, and other expenses. They were opposed by the [[Conservative Party of Newfoundland|Conservatives]] (the "Tories"), who largely represented the Anglican establishment and mercantile interests. While Tories dominated the governor's appointed Executive Council, Liberals generally held the majority of seats in the elected House of Assembly.<ref>{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Jenny|date=2009|title=Liberals, Conservatives and Sectarianism|url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/sectarianism.php|url-status=live|access-date=March 13, 2021|website=Newfoundland and Labrador Heritage|archive-date=May 4, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210504135340/https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/sectarianism.php}}</ref>

Economic conditions remained harsh. As in Ireland, the potato which made possible a steady growth in population failed as a result of the ''[[Phytophthora infestans]]'' blight. The number of deaths from the [[1846–1848 Newfoundland potato famine]] remains unknown, but there was pervasive hunger. Along with other half-hearted measures to relieve the distress, Governor John Gaspard Le Marchant declared a "Day of Public Fasting and Humiliation" in hopes the Almighty might pardon their sins and "withdraw his afflicting hand."<ref>Castelle, George (2019). "The Newfoundland Potato Famine, 1846–48: An Account from the Colony's Newspapers". ''Journal of Newfoundland and Labrador Studies'', 34 (2).

In 1855, with an Assembly majority, the Liberals under [[Philip Francis Little]] (the first Roman Catholic to practise law in St. John's) formed Newfoundland's first parliamentary government (1855–1858). Newfoundland rejected [[Canadian Confederation|confederation with Canada]] in the [[1869 Newfoundland general election|1869 general election]]. The Islanders were preoccupied with land issues—the Escheat&nbsp;movement with its call to suppress absentee landlordism in favour of the tenant farmer. Canada offered little in the way of solutions.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=Belshaw|first=John Douglas|date=2020|title=Canadian History: Post-Confederation|edition=2nd|chapter=2:13 The Other Dominion|url=https://opentextbc.ca/postconfederation2e/chapter/2-13-the-other-dominion/|url-status=live|via=BCcampus Open Publishing|access-date=April 13, 2021|archive-date=April 13, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210413134227/https://opentextbc.ca/postconfederation2e/chapter/2-13-the-other-dominion/}}</ref>

From the 1880s, as cod fishery fell into severe decline, there was large-scale emigration. While some people, working abroad, left their homes on a seasonal or temporary basis more began to leave permanently. Most emigrants (largely Catholic and of Irish descent) moved to Canada, many to find work in the steel plants and coal mines of [[Nova Scotia]]. There was also a considerable outflow to the United States and, in particular, to [[New England]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Jenny|date=2008|title=19th Century Migration|url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/19th-century-migration.php|url-status=live|access-date=March 13, 2021|website=Heritage: Newfoundland and Labrador|archive-date=June 16, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210616022310/https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/society/19th-century-migration.php}}</ref>

In 1892, St. John's burned. The [[Great Fire of 1892|Great Fire]] left 12,000 homeless. In 1894, the two commercial banks in Newfoundland collapsed. These bankruptcies left a vacuum that was subsequently filled by Canadian chartered banks, a change that subordinated Newfoundland to Canadian monetary policies.<ref name=":0"/>

Newfoundland lay outside the direct route of world traffic. St. John's, {{cvt|2000|mi|order=flip}} from [[Liverpool]] and about 1,000 miles from the east-coast American cities, was not a port of call for Atlantic liners. But with the co-ordination and extension of the railway system, new prospects for development opened in the interior. Paper and pulp mills were established by the Anglo-Newfoundland Development Co. at [[Grand Falls, Newfoundland|Grand Falls]] for the supply of the publishing empires in the UK of [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]] and [[Viscount Rothermere|Lord Rothermere]]. Iron ore mines were established at [[Bell Island (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Bell Island]].<ref name=":6">The Times (1918), Newfoundland and the War", ''The Times History of the War, Vol XIV'', (181–216), 184–186.</ref>

There had been unions seeking to negotiate wage rates in the shipbuilding trades since the 1850s.

At the beginning of 1914, economic conditions seemed favourable to reform. In a little over a decade, exports, imports and state revenue had more than doubled. Schemes were afoot for the exploitation of coal and mineral resources, and for the utilisation of peat beds for fuel. Benefiting from the settlement of disputes over fishing rights with France in 1904, and with the New England states in 1910, the fishing industry was looking to develop new markets.<ref name=":7" />

In the spring of 1918, in midst of disquiet over wartime inflation and profiteering, there had been protest. The Newfoundland Industrial Workers' Association (NIWA) struck both the rail and steamship operations of the [[Reid Newfoundland Company]], effectively isolating the capital and threatening the annual seal hunt. Central to the eventual settlement were not only wage increases, but "the great principle that employees are entitled to be heard in all matters connected with their welfare".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=McInnis|first=Peter|date=1990|title=All Solid along the Line: The Reid Newfoundland Strike of 1918|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/25143419|journal=Labour / Le Travail|volume=26|pages=61–84|doi=10.2307/25143419|issn=0700-3862|access-date=January 25, 2022|archive-date=January 25, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125151701/https://www.jstor.org/stable/25143419|url-status=live}}</ref>

When in January 1919, [[Sinn Féin]] formed the [[Dáil Éireann]] in [[Dublin]], the [[Irish question]] and local sectarian tensions resurfaced in Newfoundland.

Since the early 1800s, Newfoundland and Quebec (or Lower Canada) had been in a [[Labrador boundary dispute|border dispute]] over the Labrador region. In 1927, the British [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] ruled that the area known as modern-day Labrador was to be considered part of the Dominion of Newfoundland.<ref name="mapleweb" />

==== The Great Depression and the return of colonial rule ====
[[File:Colonial riot 500.jpg|thumb|left|People in front of the [[Colonial Building]] protesting against economic conditions, 1932. In the next year, the government of Newfoundland collapsed, and the British government resumed direct control over Newfoundland.]]
Following the stock market crash in 1929, the international market for much of Newfoundland and Labrador's goods—saltfish, pulp paper and minerals—decreased dramatically. In 1930, the country earned $40 million from its exports; that number dropped to $23.3 million in 1933. The fishery suffered particularly heavy losses as [[Dried and salted cod|salted cod]] that sold for $8.90 a [[quintal]] in 1929 fetched only half that amount by 1932.<ref name=":3" /> With this precipitous loss of export income, the level of debt Newfoundland carried from the Great War and from construction of the [[Newfoundland Railway]] proved unsustainable. In 1931, the Dominion defaulted.<ref name=":3" /> Newfoundland survived with assistance from the United Kingdom and Canada but, in the summer of 1933, faced with unprecedented economic problems at home, Canada decided against any further support.

Following retrenchment in all the Dominion's major industries, the government laid off close to one third of its civil servants and cut the wages of those it retained. For the first time since the 1880s, malnutrition was facilitating the spread of [[Thiamine deficiency|beriberi]], [[tuberculosis]] and other diseases.<ref>{{cite web|last=Higgins|first=Jenny|date=2007|title=Great Depression – Impacts on the Working Class|url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/depression-impacts.php|access-date=January 25, 2022|website=heritage.nf.ca|archive-date=January 25, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125153442/https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/depression-impacts.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

The British had a stark choice: accept financial collapse in Newfoundland or pay the full cost of keeping the country solvent. The solution, accepted by the legislature in 1933, was to accept a de facto return to direct colonial rule.<ref name="collapse">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/collapse_responsible_gov.html|title=Collapse of Responsible Government, 1929–1934|publisher=Heritage Newfoundland and Labrador|access-date=February 5, 2011|archive-date=December 20, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220171415/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/collapse_responsible_gov.html|url-status=live}}</ref> In exchange for loan guarantees by the [[British Crown|Crown]] and a promise that self-government would in time be re-established, the legislature in St. John's voted itself out of existence.<ref name="Malone" />{{rp|8–10}}<ref>Peter Neary, Newfoundland in the North Atlantic World, 1929–1949 (Montreal and Kingston: McGill-Queen's University  Press, 1988), especially chapter 2</ref> On February 16, 1934, the [[Commission of Government]] was sworn in, ending 79 years of [[responsible government]].<ref name="collapse" /> The Commission consisted of seven persons appointed by the British government.

Between 1934 and 1939, the Commission of Government managed the situation but the underlying problem, world-wide depression, resisted solution. The dispirited state of the country is said to have been evident in "'the lack of cheering and of visible enthusiasm' in the crowds that came out to see King [[George VI]] and Queen Elizabeth during their brief visit in June 1939."<ref name=":9">{{cite web|last=Neary|first=Peter|title=The History of Newfoundland and Labrador during the Second World War {{!}} Dispatches {{!}} Learn {{!}} Canadian War Museum|url=https://www.warmuseum.ca/learn/dispatches/the-history-of-newfoundland-and-labrador-during-the-second-world-war/|access-date=January 25, 2022|language=en-US|archive-date=June 7, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190607175224/https://www.warmuseum.ca/learn/dispatches/the-history-of-newfoundland-and-labrador-during-the-second-world-war/|url-status=live}}</ref>

====Second World War====
The situation changed dramatically, after Newfoundland and Labrador, with no responsible government of its own, was automatically committed to war as a result of Britain's ultimatum to Germany in September 1939. Unlike in 1914–1918, when the Dominion government volunteered and financed a full expeditionary regiment, there would be no separate presence overseas and, by implication, no compulsory enlistment. Volunteers filled the ranks of Newfoundland units in both the Royal Artillery and the Royal Air Force, and of the largest single contingent of Newfoundlanders to go overseas, the [[Newfoundland Overseas Forestry Unit]]. As a result, and taking into account service in the Newfoundland Militia, and in the merchant marine, as in the First World War<ref name=":7" /> about 12,000 Newfoundlanders were at one time or another directly or indirectly involved in the war effort.<ref name=":9" />

In June 1940, following the defeat of France and the German occupation of most of Western Europe, the Commission of Government, with British approval, authorized Canadian forces to help defend Newfoundland's air bases for the duration of the war. Canada's military commitment greatly increased in 1941 when German submarines began to attack the large numbers of merchant ships in the north-west Atlantic. In addition to reinforcing the bomber squadron at [[Gander, Newfoundland and Labrador|Gander]], the Royal Canadian Air Force provided a further squadron of bombers that flew from a new airport Canada built at Torbay (the present St. John's airport). From November 1940, a new airbase at [[Gander International Airport|Gander]] became one of the so called "sally-ports of freedom" with U.S. manufactured aircraft flying in swarms to Britain.<ref name=":9" />

Already, in March 1941, United Kingdom conceded the United States, then still officially neutral, what were effectively U.S. sovereign base rights. The Americans chose properties at St. John's, where they established an army base ([[Pepperrell Air Force Base|Fort Pepperrell]]) and a dock facility; at [[Argentia|Argentia/Marquise]], where they built a naval air base and an army base ([[Naval Station Argentia|Fort McAndrew]]); and at [[Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador|Stephenville]], where they built a large airfield (Ernest Harmon Airbase). As allies after December 1941, the Americans were also accommodated at [[Torbay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Torbay]], [[Goose Bay (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Goose Bay]] and Gander.<ref name=":9" />

This garrisoning of Newfoundland had profound economic, political and social consequences. Enlistment for service abroad and the base building boom at home eliminated the chronic unemployment of the previous decades. By 1942, the country not only enjoyed full employment and could spend more on health, education and housing, it was making interest-free loans of Canadian dollars to the by-then hard-pressed British. At the same time, the presence of so many Canadians and Americans, complete with entertainment and consumer goods, promoted a taste for the more affluent consumerism that had been developing throughout North America.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Second World War, 1939–1945|url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/second-world-war.php|access-date=January 25, 2022|website=heritage.nf.ca|archive-date=January 25, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220125151704/https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/politics/second-world-war.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== The National Convention ====
When prosperity returned with the [[Second World War]], agitation began to end the Commission and reinstate responsible government.<ref>Gene Long, ''Suspended State: Newfoundland Before Canada'' (1999)</ref> Instead, the British government created the [[Newfoundland National Convention|National Convention]] in 1946. Chaired by Judge [[Cyril J. Fox]], the Convention consisted of 45 elected members from across the dominion and was formally tasked with advising on the future of Newfoundland.

Several motions were made by [[Joey Smallwood]] (a convention member who later served as the first provincial [[Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador|premier of Newfoundland]]<ref name=newtois>{{cite web |url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/national.html |title=The Newfoundland National Convention |publisher=Heritage.nf.ca |access-date=December 3, 2010 |archive-date=April 29, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429044917/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/law/national.html |url-status=live }}</ref>) to examine joining Canada by sending a delegation to Ottawa.<ref name=newtois/> The first motion was defeated, although the Convention later decided to send delegations to both London and Ottawa to explore alternatives.<ref>Joseph Roberts Smallwood, ''I chose Canada: The Memoirs of the Honourable Joseph R.

Three main factions actively campaigned during the lead-up to the referendums on confederation with Canada:

* The [[Confederate Association]] (CA), led by Smallwood, advocated entry into the Canadian Confederation. They campaigned through a newspaper known as ''The Confederate''.
* The [[Responsible Government League]] (RGL), led by [[Peter Cashin]], advocated an independent Newfoundland with a return to [[responsible government]]. Their newspaper was ''The Independent''.

The first referendum took place on June 3, 1948; 44.6 per cent of people voted for [[responsible government]], 41.1 per cent voted for confederation with Canada, while 14.3 per cent voted for the Commission of Government. Since none of the choices had gained more than 50%, a second referendum with only the two more popular choices was held on July 22, 1948. The official outcome of that referendum was 52.3 per cent for confederation with Canada and 47.7 per cent for responsible (independent) government.<ref name=historyquatre>{{cite web |url=http://www2.marianopolis.edu/nfldhistory/NewfoundlandJoinsCanada-Confederation1949.htm |title=Newfoundland Joins Canada) and Newfoundland and Confederation (1949) |publisher=.marianopolis.edu |access-date=December 3, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720173301/http://www2.marianopolis.edu/nfldhistory/NewfoundlandJoinsCanada-Confederation1949.htm |archive-date=July 20, 2008 }}</ref> After the referendum, the British governor named a seven-man delegation to negotiate Canada's offer on behalf of Newfoundland. After six of the delegation signed, the British government passed the [[Newfoundland Act|British North America Act, 1949]] through the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]. Newfoundland officially joined Canada at midnight on March 31, 1949.<ref name=historyquatre/>

As documents in British and Canadian archives became available in the 1980s, it became evident that both Canada and the United Kingdom had wanted Newfoundland to join Canada. Some have charged it was a conspiracy to manoeuvre Newfoundland into Confederation in exchange for forgiveness of Britain's war debt and for other considerations.<ref name=Malone/>{{rp|68}} Yet, most historians who have examined the relevant documents have concluded that, while Britain engineered the inclusion of a Confederation option in the referendum, Newfoundlanders made the final decision themselves, if by a narrow margin.<ref>Jeff Webb, "Confederation, Conspiracy and Choice: A Discussion," Newfoundland Studies 14, 2 (1998): 170–87.</ref>

Following the referendum, there was a rumour that the referendum had been narrowly won by the "responsible government" side, but that the result had been fixed by the [[Gordon Macdonald, 1st Baron Macdonald of Gwaenysgor|British governor]].<ref name=Malone/>{{rp|225–26}} Shortly after the referendum, several boxes of ballots from St. John's were burned by order of [[Herman William Quinton]], one of only two commissioners who supported confederation.<ref name=Malone/>{{rp|224}} Some have argued that independent oversight of the vote tallying was lacking, though the process was supervised by respected Corner Brook Magistrate Nehemiah Short, who had also overseen elections to the National Convention.<ref name=Malone/>{{rp|224–25}}

==== 1959 Woodworkers' strike ====
In 1959, a strike led by the International Woodworkers of America (IWA) that resulted the "most bitter labour dispute in Newfoundland's history."<ref>Gwynn, Richard (199),.''Smallwood: The Unlikely Revolutionary.'' Toronto: McClelland and Stewart.</ref> Smallwood, although he had himself been an organizer in the lumber industry, feared that the strike would shut down what had become the province's largest employer. His government introduced emergency legislation that immediately decertified the IWA, prohibited secondary picketing, and made unions liable for illegal acts committed on their behalf.<ref name=":8" />

The [[International Labour Organization]], [[Canadian Labour Congress]], and the [[Newfoundland and Labrador Federation of Labour|Newfoundland Federation of Labour]] condemned the legislation, and Canadian Prime Minister [[John Diefenbaker]] refused to provide the province with additional police to enforce the legislation. But running out of food and money, the loggers eventually abandoned the strike, joined Smallwood's newly created Newfoundland Brotherhood of Wood Workers, and negotiated a settlement with the logging companies, ending the strike and effectively undermining the IWA.<ref name=":8"/>

==== Resettlement programs ====
From the early 1950s, the provincial government pursued a policy of [[population transfer]] by centralizing the rural population. A [[Resettlement (Newfoundland)|resettlement]] of the many isolated communities scattered along Newfoundland's coasts was seen as a way to save rural Newfoundland by moving people to what were referred to as "growth centres". It was believed this would allow the government to provide more and better public services such as education, health care, roads and electricity. The resettlement policy was also expected to create more employment opportunities outside of the fishery, or in spinoff industries, which meant a stronger and more modern fishing industry for those remaining in it.<ref name="whif2">{{cite web|last=Whiffen|first=Glen|title=Newfoundland and Labrador's forced resettlement a historic injustice, brothers say {{!}} The Telegram|url=http://www.thetelegram.com/news/local/newfoundland-and-labradors-forced-resettlement-a-historic-injustice-brothers-say-170787/|access-date=March 15, 2021|website=thetelegram.com|language=en|archive-date=February 24, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224234604/https://www.thetelegram.com/news/local/newfoundland-and-labradors-forced-resettlement-a-historic-injustice-brothers-say-170787/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Three attempts of resettlement were initiated by the Government between 1954 and 1975 which resulted in the abandonment of 300 communities and nearly 30,000 people moved.<ref name="encyclopedia-p5852">''Encyclopedia of Newfoundland and Labrador'', Volume four, p. 585, {{ISBN|978-0-9693422-1-2}}.</ref> Denounced as poorly resourced and as an historic injustice,<ref name="whif2"/> resettlement has been viewed as possibly the most controversial government policy of the post-Confederation Newfoundland and Labrador.<ref name="encyclopedia-p5852"/>

==== Climate change ====
In the new century, the provincial government is anticipating the challenges of global warming. Locally average annual temperatures are variously estimated to be already between 0.8&nbsp;°C<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|publisher=Municipal Affairs and Environment: Climate Change Branch|url=https://www.gov.nl.ca/ecc/files/publications-the-way-forward-climate-change.pdf|title=The Way Forward: On Climate Change in Newfoundland and Labrador|year=2019|location=St. Johns|access-date=May 21, 2021|archive-date=June 21, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210621175527/https://www.gov.nl.ca/ecc/files/publications-the-way-forward-climate-change.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref> and 1.5&nbsp;°C above historical norms<ref>{{cite web|title=Turn Back the Tide {{!}} Impacts of Climate Change|url=https://www.turnbackthetide.ca/about-climate-change-and-energy-efficiency/impacts-of-climate-change.shtml|access-date=May 21, 2021|website=turnbackthetide.ca|language=en|archive-date=February 12, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210212091213/https://www.turnbackthetide.ca/about-climate-change-and-energy-efficiency/impacts-of-climate-change.shtml|url-status=live}}</ref> and the frequency of hurricanes and tropical storms have doubled in comparison to the last century. As a result, the province is experiencing increased permafrost melt, flooding, and infrastructure damage, reduced sea ice, and greater risk from new invasive species and infectious diseases.<ref name=":5"/>

The government believes that in just fifty years (2000–2050), temperatures in Newfoundland will have risen by two and a half to three degrees in summer and three and a half to five degrees in winter, and that in Labrador warming will be even more severe. Under those conditions the winter season could shorten by as much as four to five weeks in some locations and that extreme storm events could result in an increase of precipitation by over 20% or more, enhancing the likelihood and magnitude of flooding. Meanwhile, sea levels are anticipated to rise by a half meter, putting coastal infrastructure at risk. Against these hazards, the government sets the province's "vast renewable [wind, sea and hydro] energy resources" with their potential to reduce carbon emissions in the province and elsewhere.<ref name=":5"/>

The communities of St. John's, [[Mount Pearl]], [[Paradise, Newfoundland and Labrador|Paradise]], and [[Torbay, Newfoundland and Labrador|Torbay]] declared a state of emergency.

[[Newfoundland English]] is a term referring to any of several [[Accent (dialect)|accent]]s and [[dialect]]s of the [[English language]] found in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Most of these differ substantially from the English commonly spoken elsewhere in neighbouring [[Canada]] and the [[North Atlantic]]. Many Newfoundland dialects are similar to the [[West Country dialects|dialects]] of the [[West Country]] in England, particularly the city of [[Bristol]] and counties of [[Cornwall]], [[Devon]], [[Dorset]], [[Hampshire]] and [[Somerset]], while other Newfoundland dialects resemble those of Ireland's southeastern counties, particularly [[County Waterford|Waterford]], [[County Wexford|Wexford]], [[County Kilkenny|Kilkenny]] and [[County Cork|Cork]]. Still others blend elements of both, and there is also a discernible influence of [[Scottish English]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/scottish.html|title=Scottish in NL|website=heritage.nf.ca|access-date=November 26, 2015|archive-date=October 13, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013145759/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/scottish.html|url-status=live}}</ref> While the Scots came in smaller numbers than the English and Irish, they had a large influence on Newfoundland society.<ref name="renamed_from_2006_on_20151223002828"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/west_country.html|title=West Country|website=heritage.nf.ca|access-date=November 26, 2015|archive-date=April 23, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150423033448/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/society/west_country.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="A Short History">Newfoundland Historical Society, ''A Short History of Newfoundland and Labrador'', St. John's, NL, Boulder Publications, 2008.</ref>

==Culture==

===Art===
{{Main|Art of Newfoundland and Labrador}}
Before 1950, the visual arts were a minor aspect of Newfoundland cultural life, compared with the performing arts such as music or theatre. Until about 1900, most art was the work of visiting artists, who included members of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], [[Rockwell Kent]] and [[Eliot O'Hara]]. Artists such as Newfoundland-born [[Maurice Galbraith Cullen|Maurice Cullen]] and [[Robert Pilot]] travelled to Europe to study art in prominent ateliers.<ref>Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 37</ref>
[[File:Artist sketching the St. John's Harbour and skyline (c. 1910).jpg|thumb|left|Photograph of an artist sketching St. John's harbour and skyline, {{circa|1890}}]]
By the turn of the 20th century, amateur art was made by people living and working in the province. These artists included J.W. Hayward and his son Thomas B. Hayward, Agnes Marian Ayre, and [[Harold B. Goodridge]], the last of whom worked on a number of mural commissions, notably one for the lobby of the [[Confederation Building (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Confederation Building]] in St. John's.<ref name="heritage.nf.ca">{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/visual-arts.php|title=Visual Arts|website=heritage.nf.ca|access-date=May 31, 2016|archive-date=August 9, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809050447/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/visual-arts.php|url-status=live}}</ref> Local art societies became prominent in the 1940s, particularly The Art Students Club, which opened in 1940.<ref>"Without a Suitable Gallery, Club Tries to Encourage Nfld. Art," The Daily News, (June 23, 1950).</ref>

After Newfoundland and Labrador joined Canada in 1949, government grants fostered a supportive environment for visual artists, primarily painters. The visual arts of the province developed significantly in the second half of the century, with the return of young Newfoundland artists whom had studied abroad. Amongst the first were [[Rae Perlin]], who studied at the [[Art Students League]] in New York, and [[Helen Parsons Shepherd]] and her husband Reginald Shepherd, who both graduated from the [[Ontario College of Art]].<ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/> The Shepherds established the province's first art school, the Newfoundland Academy of Art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/reginald-shepherd.php|title=Reginald Shepherd|website=heritage.nf.ca|access-date=May 31, 2016|archive-date=May 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531033105/http://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/reginald-shepherd.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

Newfoundland-born painters [[Christopher Pratt]] and [[Mary Pratt (painter)|Mary Pratt]] returned to the province in 1961 to work at the newly established [[Memorial University Art Gallery]] as its first curator, later transitioning to painting full-time in Salmonier. [[David Blackwood]] graduated from the [[Ontario College of Art]] in the early 1960s and achieved acclaim with his images of Newfoundland culture and history. Newfoundland-born artist [[Gerald Squires]] returned in 1969.<ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/>

The creation of [[The Memorial University Extension Services]] and [[St. Michael's Printshop]] in the 1960s and 1970s attracted a number of visual artists to the province to teach and create art. Similarly, the school in Hibb's Hole (now [[Hibb's Cove]]), established by painter [[George Noseworthy]], brought professional artists such as [[Anne Meredith Barry]] to the province.<ref>Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. p. 43</ref> A notable artist during this period is [[Marlene Creates]].<ref name="heritage.nf.ca"/>
[[File:The Rooms (North face), St. John's, Newfoundland, Canada.jpg|thumb|[[The Rooms]] is a provincial cultural facility that houses the [[Provincial and territorial museums of Canada|provincial art gallery]].]]
From 1980 to present, opportunities for artists continued to develop, as galleries such as the [[Art Gallery of Newfoundland and Labrador]] (which later became [[The Rooms]] Provincial Art Gallery), the [[Resource Centre for the Arts]], and [[Eastern Edge]] were established. Fine arts education programs were established at post-secondary institutions such as [[Sir Wilfred Grenfell College]] in [[Corner Brook]], the Western Community College (now [[College of the North Atlantic]]) in [[Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador|Stephenville]], and the [[Anna Templeton Centre]] in St. John's.<ref>Mireille Eagan."Before Category," PAGES, vol. 1 no. 1, (The Rooms), 2013. pp. 43–44</ref>

Newfoundland and Labrador's arts community is recognized nationally and internationally.

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Newfoundland and Labrador}}
Newfoundland and Labrador has a folk musical heritage based on the [[Music of Ireland|Irish]], [[English folk music|English]] and [[Music of Scotland|Scottish]] traditions that were brought to its shores centuries ago. Though similar in its [[Celtic music|Celtic]] influence to neighbouring [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], Newfoundland and Labrador are more Irish than Scottish, and have more elements imported from English and French music than those provinces.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/traditional-music-arts.php|title=Traditional Music|website=heritage.nf.ca|access-date=January 12, 2019|archive-date=January 13, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190113003855/https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/arts/traditional-music-arts.php|url-status=live}}</ref> Much of the region's music focuses on the strong seafaring tradition in the area, and includes [[Sea shanty|sea shanties]] and other sailing songs.

A leading institution for research in ethnomusicology, Memorial's Research Centre for the Study of Music, Media, and Place, offers academic lectures, scholarly residencies, conferences, symposia, and outreach activities to the province on music and culture.

The pre-confederation and current provincial anthem is the "[[Ode to Newfoundland]]", written by British colonial governor Sir Charles [[Cavendish Boyle]] in 1902. It was adopted as the official Newfoundland anthem on May 20, 1904. In 1980, the province re-adopted the song as an official provincial anthem. "The Ode to Newfoundland" is still sung at public events in Newfoundland and Labrador.

[[File:Edwin J. Pratt.JPG|thumb|upright|[[E. J. Pratt]] wrote a number of poems describing maritime life and the history of Canada.]]
The earliest works of poetry in [[British North America]], mainly written by visitors and targeted at a European audience, described the new territories in optimistic terms. One of the first works was [[Robert Hayman]]'s ''Quodlibets'', a collection of verses composed in Newfoundland and published in 1628.

In the [[oral tradition]] of [[County Waterford]], the [[Munster Irish]] poet [[Donnchadh Ruadh Mac Conmara]], a former [[hedge school]] teacher, is said to have sailed for Newfoundland around 1743, allegedly to escape the wrath of a man whose daughter the poet had impregnated.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://waterfordireland.tripod.com/donncha_ruadh_macconmara.htm |title=Donnchadh Ruadh |access-date=January 1, 2023 |archive-date=February 21, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200221124036/http://waterfordireland.tripod.com/donncha_ruadh_macconmara.htm |url-status=live }}</ref> During the 21st century, however, [[linguist]]s discovered that several of Donnchadh Ruadh's poems in the [[Irish language]] contain multiple Gaelicized words and terms known to be unique to [[Newfoundland English]]. For this reason, Donnchadh Ruadh's poems are considered the earliest literature in the [[Irish language in Newfoundland]].<ref>Edited by Natasha Sumner and Aidan Doyle (2020), ''North American Gaels: Speech, Song, and Story in the Diaspora'', [[McGill-Queen's University]] Press.

[[File:Flag of Labrador.svg|right|thumb|The unofficial [[Flag of Labrador]], used by a number of Labradorians]]
Newfoundland and Labrador's [[Flag of Newfoundland and Labrador|present provincial flag]], designed by Newfoundland artist [[Christopher Pratt]], was officially adopted by the legislature on May 28, 1980, and first flown on "Discovery Day" that year. The blue is meant to represent the sea, the white represents snow and ice, the red represents the efforts and struggles of the people, and the gold represents the confidence of Newfoundlanders and Labradorians. The blue triangles are a tribute to the Union Flag, and represent the British heritage of the province. The two red triangles represent Labrador (the mainland portion of the province) and the island. In Pratt's words, the golden arrow points towards a "brighter future".<ref name="The Newfoundland Flag">{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.nl.ca/aboutnl/flag.html|title=About Newfoundland and Labrador – Provincial Flag|access-date=March 22, 2017|archive-date=February 3, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210203121433/https://www.gov.nl.ca/aboutnl/flag.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

What has commonly but mistakenly been called the Newfoundland tricolour [[Newfoundland Tricolour|"Pink, White and Green"(sic)]] is the flag of the Catholic Church affiliated Star of the Sea Association (SOSA). It originated in the late nineteenth century and enjoyed popularity among people who were under the impression that it was the Native Flag of Newfoundland which was created before 1852 by the Newfoundland Natives' Society. The true Native Flag (red-white-green tricolour) was widely flown into the late nineteenth century. Neither tricolour was ever adopted by the Newfoundland government.<ref name="THE PROVINCES Chap XIX">{{cite web|url=http://www.fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Provinces/Newfoundland.html|title=THE PROVINCES Chap XIX: Newfoundland|access-date=June 22, 2010|archive-date=February 25, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225073118/http://www.fraser.cc/FlagsCan/Provinces/Newfoundland.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The "Pink, White and Green"(sic) has been adopted by some residents as a symbol of ties with Irish heritage and as a political statement.

==Sports==
[[File:Mile one stadium.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Brown's Centre]] (formerly Mile One Centre) is an indoor arena in St. John's.]]
Newfoundland and Labrador has a somewhat different sports culture from the rest of Canada, owing in part to its long history separate from the rest of Canada and under British rule. [[Ice hockey]], however, remains popular; Though operations ceased in April 2024, a minor league professional team called the [[Newfoundland Growlers]] of the [[ECHL]] played at [[Mary Brown's Centre]] (formerly Mile One Centre) in St. John's from the 2018–19 to 2023-24 seasons. The area had an intermittent [[American Hockey League]] presence with the [[St. John's Maple Leafs]] then [[St. John's IceCaps]] until 2017, and the [[Newfoundland Senior Hockey League]] had teams around the island. Since the departure of the [[St. John's Fog Devils]] in 2008, Newfoundland and Labrador is the only province in Canada to not have a team in the major junior [[Canadian Hockey League]] (should one ever join it would be placed in the [[QMJHL]], which hosted the Fog Devils and has jurisdiction over Atlantic Canada).

[[Association football]] (soccer) and [[rugby union]] are both more popular in Newfoundland and Labrador than the rest of Canada in general. Soccer is hosted at [[King George V Park]], a 6,000-seat stadium built as Newfoundland's national stadium during the time as an independent dominion. [[Swilers Rugby Park]] is home of the [[Swilers RFC]] rugby union club, as well as the [[Atlantic Rock]], one of the four regional teams in the [[Canadian Rugby Championship]]. Other sports facilities in Newfoundland and Labrador include [[Pepsi Centre]], an indoor arena in Corner Brook; and [[St. Patrick's Park]], a baseball park in St. John's.

[[Gridiron football]], be it either [[American football|American]] or [[Canadian football|Canadian]], is almost non-existent; it is the only Canadian province other than [[Prince Edward Island]] to have never hosted a [[Canadian Football League]] or [[CIS football|Canadian Interuniversity Sport]] game, and it was not until 2013 the province saw its first amateur teams form.

[[Cricket]] was once a popular sport. The earliest mention is in the ''Newfoundland Mercantile Journal'', Thursday September 16, 1824, indicating the St. John's Cricket Club was an established club at this time.<ref name="cancricket">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadacricket.com/nlcricket/?page_id=4|title=History – Cricket Newfoundland and Labrador|website=canadacricket.com|access-date=June 22, 2017|archive-date=July 1, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701180318/http://www.canadacricket.com/nlcricket/?page_id=4|url-status=live}}</ref> The St. John's Cricket club was one of the first cricket clubs in North America. Other centres were at [[Harbour Grace]], [[Twillingate]] and [[Trinity, Newfoundland and Labrador|Trinity]]. The heyday of the game was the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, at which time there was league in St. John's, as well as an interschool tournament. John Shannon Munn is Newfoundland's most famous cricketer, having represented Oxford University. After the first World War, cricket declined in popularity and was replaced by soccer and baseball. However, with the arrival of immigrants from the [[Indian subcontinent]], cricket is once again gaining interest in the province.<ref name="cancricket" />

In 2024 Newfoundland and Labrador became the shirt sponsors of [[Barrow A.F.C.]], A Football (Soccer) team located in North West England.
