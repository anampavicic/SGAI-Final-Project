'''Limeira''' is a city in the eastern part of the [[Brazil]]ian [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]. With a population of approximately 291,869 people (2022 [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]].) and covering an area of 581 square kilometers, it sits at an elevation of 588 meters.<ref>[https://archive.today/20150916103418/http://cod.ibge.gov.br/233OQ Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística]</ref> The city is situated 154 kilometers from [[São Paulo]], the capital of the state, and 1011 kilometers from [[Brasília|Brasilia]], the capital of Brazil. Limeira is conveniently accessible from São Paulo via two highways: [[Rodovia Anhanguera]] and [[Rodovia dos Bandeirantes]].

In the past, Limeira was a significant center for [[Coffee culture|coffee cultivation]] and played a strategic role in the industry. It also earned the nickname "Brazilian orange capital" due to its extensive production of [[citrus]] fruits. However, the primary agricultural focus in the city has now shifted to [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]] cultivation. Limeira has gained international recognition as "Brazil's plated jewelry capital" due to its thriving industry in plated and semi-jewelry. More than 450 companies in Limeira are responsible for half of Brazil's exports in this sector.

Limeira is part of the São Paulo metropolitan complex, which is the largest in the southern hemisphere, with an estimated population of around 30 million people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=GOV.BR |url=https://www.gov.br/pt-br/pagina-inicial |access-date=2023-06-06 |website=Serviços e Informações do Brasil |language=pt-br}}</ref>

==History==

The history of Limeira dates back to the economic exploitation of the state of São Paulo, specifically in the mid-1820s, marking the foundation of the Limeira region.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} The city's name is steeped in legend, offering an intriguing explanation for its origins.

According to local folklore, pioneers would often seek respite at a guesthouse situated approximately 150&nbsp;km from São Paulo, near the Tatuibi River. In the [[Tupi-Guarani]] language, "Tatuibi" translates to "small armadillo." This resting place became known as Rancho Morro Azul (Blue Hill Ranch) due to its proximity to a striking blue-hued hill that could be seen from a distance.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

According to the legend, in 1781, a caravan traveling to the wilderness of Araraquara made a stop in Limeira and set up camp near a stream called Córrego do Bexiga, which is now the location of the Market Model. Among the members of the caravan was a Franciscan friar named João das Mercês, who carried a variety of lime orange known as "picuá de limas," believed to possess healing properties for fevers. However, the friar fell ill later that night and attributed his sickness to the limas, suspecting that they had been poisoned. He died during the night, and the following day, he was buried at the same site along with his untouched Picuá de Lima limes that no one dared to consume due to the perceived risk of poisoning. Legend has it that a lime tree sprouted from the seeds of those limes. Over the years, the place originally known as Rancho do Morro Azul (Blue Hill Ranch) came to be called Rancho de Limeira (the Ranch of the Lime Orange Tree).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-06-26 |title=O limeirense |url=http://www.olimeirense.com.br/historia.htm#nome |access-date=2023-06-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626055212/http://www.olimeirense.com.br/historia.htm#nome |archive-date=2010-06-26 }}</ref>

=== Historical Background ===
The founding of Limeira took place on cleared land situated along the path known as the "Picadão de Cuiabá", an important historical route that played a crucial role in trade and the provision of resources to mines in [[Mato Grosso]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite journal |last=Rosada |first=Mateus |date=2009-01-01 |title=Ibicaba, uma fazenda de café modelo |url=https://www.academia.edu/7599924 |journal=Congreso de TICCIH - the International Committee for the Conservation of the Industrial Heritage}}</ref>

During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, landowners and farmers from "Cidade da Constituição" ([[Piracicaba]]), [[Itu, São Paulo|Itu]], [[Porto Feliz]], and [[Atibaia]] identified the region as having fertile land for agriculture. They acquired allotments from the provincial government between 1799 and 1820.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

The village of Limeira began to develop with the installation of mills and the arrival of slaveholders and slaves. Squatters who had settled in the area were subsequently expelled. According to the 1822 census, the population of the Town of Piracicaba, including the regions of Morro Azul and Tatuibi (both part of Limeira), consisted of 951 free people and 546 slaves.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Mendes |first=Felipe Landim Ribeiro |title=Ibicaba revisitada outra vez: espaço, escravidão e trabalho livre no oeste paulista1 |journal=Anais do Museu Paulista: História e Cultura Material |year=2017 |language=pt |volume=25 |pages=301–357 |doi=10.1590/1982-02672017v25n0112 |issn=0101-4714|doi-access=free }}</ref>

The road infrastructure connecting Limeira to the capital was inadequate, prompting Nicolau Pereira de Campos Vergueiro to lead a group of farmers, including Manuel Bento de Barros and José Ferraz de Campos, in requesting the construction of a new road. Their aim was to facilitate the transportation of goods from the mills in the region of Piracicaba and Limeira.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Upon the completion of the new road in 1826 and the subsequent formalization of the settlement project known as the Freguesia de Nossa Senhora das Dores do Tatuibi in 1830, the municipality of Limeira took shape.<ref>{{Cite web |title=LIMEIRA |url=https://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/dtbs/saopaulo/limeira.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929130828/http://biblioteca.ibge.gov.br/visualizacao/dtbs/saopaulo/limeira.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-29 |access-date=2023-09-05 |website=biblioteca.ibge.gov.br |language=pt}}</ref> The bustling trade and flourishing development along this road were instrumental in laying the foundations of the city.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

In 1842, Limeira was elevated to the status of a village. Two years later, in 1844, the city council was established with Manuel José de Carvalho serving as its first president. In 1842, the village of Limeira was elevated to the status of a town and eventually achieved city status on April 18, 1863. The city's official anniversary is celebrated on September 15, and it is considered to have been founded in 1826.<ref>{{Cite web |title=MÊS DO ANIVERSÁRIO: Limeira faz 194 anos; e com muita música – Tribuna |url=http://portaltribuna.com.br/2020/09/mes-do-aniversario-limeira-faz-194-anos-e-com-muita-musica/ |access-date=2023-06-06 |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

Limeira holds historical significance as one of the earliest cities in Brazil to embrace privately sponsored European immigration.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} In 1840, Nicolau Pereira de Campos Vergueiro, owner of Ibicaba Mill, introduced a partnership system by bringing eighty Portuguese individuals to work on his lands. This initiative aimed to replace slave labor with free European workers who would receive certain benefits. German immigrants also joined the workforce at Ibicaba in 1846, further contributing to the transition away from slave labor.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

The Ibicaba farm, which became one of Brazil's largest coffee producers during its peak, entered the realm of literary art. In her historical novel, Swiss writer [[Eveline Hasler]] accompanies Swiss settlers on their journey and colonization in Ibicaba. In 1996, the property embarked on tourism activities and has since welcomed a considerable number of domestic and international visitors. However, the majority of its revenue is derived from sugarcane farming, as its lands are leased to Usina Iracema.<ref name="auto"/>

Today, the Ibicaba farm is renowned for its historical significance and architectural features. It encompasses structures such as the main house, slave quarters, terraces, and dams, which contribute to the city's collection of historic farms.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Mirage of the New World: Eveline Hasler's Ibicaba, das Paradies in den Köpfen |url=https://academic.oup.com/fmls/article-abstract/44/1/76/542255 |access-date=2023-06-06 |website=academic.oup.com}}</ref>

==Geography==
Limeira is located at an elevation of 588 meters in the [[Campinas]] Administrative Region, 145&nbsp;km northwest of São Paulo city. It serves as the administrative hub for the Limeira Microregion, which encompasses eight municipalities: [[Araras]], [[Leme, São Paulo|Leme]], Limeira, [[Pirassununga]], [[Cordeirópolis]], [[Conchal]], [[Santa Cruz da Conceição]], and [[Iracemápolis]]. The city benefits from its strategic positioning along major road and rail networks, connecting São Paulo state to [[Minas Gerais]] and the Midwest region of Brazil. It is also well-connected to a prominent railway line that facilitates the transportation of goods from the [[Amazon basin|Amazon region]] to the [[port of Santos]]. Limeira is situated near the Tietê-Paraná Waterway, a significant water route that links it to the southern states of Brazil and the Mercosur countries. The city is positioned in a region characterized by a peripheral depression, with elevations ranging from 500 to 800 meters. Morro Azul is a notable landmark in the Limeira region, standing at an elevation of 831 meters above sea level, making it the highest point in the area.{{cn|date=August 2023}} This prominent feature has served as a reliable reference point for pioneers and travelers, guiding them through the vast territories of the region.

=== Climate ===
Limeira experiences a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] Cwa), with distinctive wet and dry seasons lasting from October to March and from April to September, respectively, and warm to hot temperatures year-round. The average temperature is 19.8&nbsp;°C (67.6&nbsp;°F) and yearly precipitation stands at 1300.5&nbsp;mm (51.2&nbsp;in).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jornal do Tempo {{!}} Climatologia para Limeira-SP |url=http://jornaldotempo.uol.com.br/climatologia.html/Limeira-SP// |access-date=2017-04-15 |website=jornaldotempo.uol.com.br |language=pt-br}}</ref> On 17 October 2014, temperatures in the city reached a record high of 38.6&nbsp;°C (101.4&nbsp;°F) and its coldest day was 9 July 2011, with a low of 0.1&nbsp;°C (32.1&nbsp;°F).

===Industry===

Limeira's industrial legacy dates back to 1850 when it first ventured into the manufacturing of agricultural equipment. During the [[Paraguayan War]], Limeira played a pivotal role by producing instruments for soldiers. Between 1907 and 1922, Limeira witnessed the emergence of significant industries, including Chapéus Prada (1907), Café Kühl (1920), and Indústria de Papel Santa Cruz (1922).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nossa Cidade |url=https://www.acillimeira.com.br/nossa-cidade |access-date=2023-06-06 |website=ACIL - Associação Comercial e Industrial de Limeira |language=pt-br}}</ref> However, it was after the 1940s that Limeira gained recognition for its industrial sector.

[[File:Prada.jpg|left|250px|thumb| Former Chapéus Prada industrial building, now Limeira City Hall.]]
Between the 1940s and 1970s, Limeira witnessed the rise of several citrus companies engaged in orange cultivation and orange juice production. These companies catered to both domestic and international markets, including the United States and Europe, contributing to Limeira's reputation as "The City of Orange". Among the prominent players were Citrobrasil (1940) and Citrosuco (1966), which dominated the orange production sector in Limeira.{{cn|date=December 2023}} However, the orange industry in Limeira faced a significant setback when the United States implemented protective measures to support its own orange industry in [[California]].{{cn|date=December 2023}} This led to a decline in orange production in Limeira. Additionally, the automotive sector gained prominence in Limeira after World War II, with the establishment of companies like 'Freios Varga' (now TRW) in 1945 and 'Rodas Fumagalli' in 1946.{{cn|date=December 2023}}

In the aftermath of the 1970s, Limeira's industrial sector experienced a rapid expansion, attracting the interest of multinational corporations. Among the notable companies that established their presence in the city are [[Ajinomoto]]. In 1974, the American corporation [[Rockwell International|Rockwell]] acquired Fumagalli, and in 2000, 'Freios Varga' became a part of the English-based Lucas Group. In more recent years, Limeira has become a preferred destination for Japanese and Korean automotive companies, including Yacchyio do Brasil, Stanley, Mando, DAS, and Faurecia. Furthermore, the city has witnessed the construction of a new plant by the French company [[Faurecia]]. In 2011, [[Samsung]] made a substantial investment of $300 million to establish its manufacturing facility in Limeira.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://valor.globo.com/empresas/noticia/2011/09/20/samsung-investe-us-300-milhoes.ghtml|title=Samsung investe US$ 300 milhões|date=September 20, 2011|website=Valor Econômico}}</ref>

Limeira is renowned for its thriving plated jewelry and semi-jewelry industry, attracting customers from all over the world and earning the city the title of "Brazil's capital of plated jewelry."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Martins |first=Binha |title=Museu da Jóia de Limeira, SP |url=https://www.revistaneoo.com/2016/09/museu-da-joia-de-limeira-sp.html |access-date=2023-06-15 |website=Revista Nós e outros Olhos}}</ref>

To make the city more appealing to industries, The local government has implemented various incentive programs aimed at reducing unemployment and informal labor, which have been on the rise along with the city's population. A significant portion of the population commutes to nearby cities such as Piracicaba and [[Americana, São Paulo|Americana]] for work. According to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics ([[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]]), Limeira had a GDP of [[Brazilian real|R$]]12.155 billion (approximately U$3.81 billion) in 2017, with the industrial sector accounting for roughly 50% of registered jobs in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-06-06 |title=PIB de Limeira teve aumento de 10,5% em 2017, divulga IBGE |url=https://gazetadelimeira.com.br/economia/2147495730 |access-date=2023-06-06 |website=Gazeta de Limeira |language=pt-br}}</ref> Limeira's industrial park has been developed and implemented guided by its incentive program, emphasizing its industrial vocation.

Limeira benefits from several advantageous factors for its development, including the expansion of the Bandeirantes Highway (Rodovia dos Bandeirantes), the establishment of the Tietê-Paraná waterway, and the installation of the Brazil-Bolivia gas pipeline.<ref>{{Cite web |title=GasNet O Site do Gás Natural e GNV - Fornecimento de gás canalizado começa em prédios do Centro de Limeira (SP) |url=https://www.gasnet.com.br/Conteudo/Detalhe/4462 |access-date=2023-06-06 |website=www.gasnet.com.br}}</ref>

=== Commercial and Service Industries ===
The commerce and service sector in Limeira is vibrant and diverse. The city is home to over 4,000 retail stores and 3,000 service businesses.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} The introduction of a shopping complex along the Anhanguera Road in the 1980s greatly stimulated the expansion of Limeira's service industry. In line with the global trends of globalization and outsourcing, a multitude of companies have emerged in Limeira, offering support to the city's industrial sector through modernization efforts.

Although the original mall closed in the 1990s, there is still a shopping mall located in the downtown area known as Shopping Patio Limeira.

In terms of public services, Limeira is home to several regional organizations and government agencies, as well as private institutions like CIESP, [[SENAI]], [[Industrial Social Services|SESI]], and SENAC.

One of the main challenges faced by the city is competition from neighboring cities, which offer a wider variety and more convenient shopping options. In some cases, residents may prefer to travel to Campinas or Piracicaba for their consumer needs. {{Citation needed|date=June 2023}}

==Health==

Limeira is home to five major hospitals, two of which operate as charitable institutions and receive public financial and management support:
* [[Santa Casa de Misericórdia]]
* Sociedade Operária Humanitária

The other three hospitals are privately owned:
* Hospital [[Unimed (organization)|Unimed]]
* Hospital Medical
