'''Petah Tikva''' ({{langx|he|{{Script/Hebrew|פתח תקווה}}}} {{IPA|he|ˈpetaχ ˈtikva|}}, {{Literal translation|Opening of Hope}}), also known as '''Em HaMoshavot''' ({{literal translation|Mother of the ''[[Moshava|Moshavot]]''}}), is a city in the [[Central District (Israel)|Central District]] of [[Israel]], {{convert|10.6|km|1|abbr=on}} east of [[Tel Aviv]]. It was founded in 1878, mainly by [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jews]] of the [[Old Yishuv]], and became a permanent settlement in 1883 with the financial help of [[Edmond James de Rothschild|Baron Edmond de Rothschild]].

In {{Israel populations|Year}}, the city had a population of {{Israel populations|Petah Tiqwa}},{{Israel populations|reference}} being so the [[List of cities in Israel|fifth-largest city]] in Israel. Its population density is approximately {{convert|6277|PD/km2}}. Its jurisdiction covers 35,868 [[dunam]]s (~35.9&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> or 15 sq&nbsp;mi). Petah Tikva is part of the [[Tel Aviv Metropolitan Area]].

==Etymology==
Petah Tikva takes its name (meaning "Door of Hope") from the biblical allusion in [[Hosea]] 2:15: "... and make the valley of Achor a door of hope."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Petah-Tiqwa|title=Petaḥ Tiqwa &#124; Israel|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2019-11-06|archive-date=2019-11-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106074226/https://www.britannica.com/place/Petah-Tiqwa|url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Achor Valley]], near [[Jericho]], was the original proposed location for the town.

Originally intending to establish a new settlement in the [[Achor Valley]], near [[Jericho]], the settlers purchased land in that area. However, [[Abdul Hamid II|Abdülhamid II]] cancelled the purchase and forbade them from settling there, but they retained the name Petah Tikva as a symbol of their aspirations.

In 1878, the founders of Petah Tikva learned of the availability of land northeast of [[Jaffa]] near the village of Mulabes (or Umlabes). The land was owned by two [[Christians|Christian]] businessmen from Jaffa, Antoine Bishara Tayan and Selim Qassar, and was worked by some thirty tenant farmers. Tayan's property was the larger, some 8,500 dunams, but much of it was in the malarial swamp of the [[Yarkon River|Yarkon Valley]]. Qassar's property, approximately 3,500 dunams, lay a few kilometers to the south of the Yarkon, away from the swampland. It was Qassar's that was purchased on July 30, 1878. Tayan's holdings were purchased when a second group of settlers, known as the Yarkonim, arrived in Petah Tikva  the following year.<ref>{{harvtxt|Avneri|1984|p=71}}; {{harvtxt|Glass|Kark|1991|pp=137–138}}; {{harvtxt|Ben Ezer|2013}} has a more detailed discussion of the Yarkonim, in Hebrew.</ref> [[Ottoman Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] allowed the purchase because of the poor quality of the land.<ref>{{cite book |last= Yaari|first= Avraham|date= 1958|title= The Goodly Heritage: Memoirs Describing the Life of the Jewish Community of Eretz Yisrael From the Seventeenth to the Twentieth Centuries|location= Jerusalem|publisher= Youth and Hechalutz Dept. of the Zionist Organization|others= (Translated and abridged by Israel Schen; edited by Isaac Halevy-Levin)|page=93}}</ref>

In a [[microhistory|microhistorical]] anecdote of Petah Tikva, Yehuda Raab, one of the Hungarian settlers, recalls in his memoirs meeting a [[History of the Jews in Iraq|Baghdadi Jew]], Daud abu Yusuf, who despite appearing as a [[Bedouin]], announced “ana Israʾili,” ''I am Jewish'', and recited the [[shema]] by way of proof. Yusuf, along with a [[History of the Jews in Morocco|Moroccan Jew]] from [[Jaffo]], Yaʿqub bin Maymun Zirmati, was hired as a guard for colony; it was customary for European Jewish colonies to hire local Arab guards or in some cases [[Yemenite Jews]]. Both were Ottoman imperial subjects and were important cultural and linguistic go-betweens, for example in the horse and camel trade, from the world of the [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] colonists and that of the Eastern or [[Maghribi Jews]], today called [[Mizrahi Jews]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Halperin |first=Liora R. |date=February 2019 |title=Trading Secrets: Constructions and Contexts of Two Middle Eastern Jewish Guards in the Early Petah Tikva Agricultural Colony |url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-journal-of-middle-east-studies/article/abs/trading-secrets-constructions-and-contexts-of-two-middle-eastern-jewish-guards-in-the-early-petah-tikva-agricultural-colony/565AE88012E1D8445EB1FCC3AB5CCDA1 |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |language=en |volume=51 |issue=1 |pages=65–86 |doi=10.1017/S0020743818001162 |issn=0020-7438}}</ref>

A [[malaria]] epidemic broke out in 1880, forcing the abandonment of the settlements on both holdings by 1881<ref>{{harvtxt|Yaari|1958|pp=89–93}} suggests that the colonists began to abandon Petah Tikva in late 1880, and had all left  in 1881.</ref> or 1882.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Martin |title=Israel: A History |date=September 23, 2008 |publisher=Mariner Books |isbn=978-0688123635 |edition=Revised}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=November 4, 2021 |title=This week in Jewish history {{!}} Petah Tikvah founded |url=https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/this-week-in-jewish-history--petah-tikvah-founded |access-date=2024-09-27 |website=World Jewish Congress |language=EN}}</ref> Those who remained in the area moved south to [[Yehud, Israel|Yehud]].

In March 1886, Arab peasants from [[Yahudiya]] attacked the Jewish colony, injuring 5, with one dying later, possibly due to aggravation of her preexisting condition.

Upon learning that the Austrian post office in Jaffa wanted to open a branch in Petah Tikva,  Yitzchak Goldenhirsch, an early resident, offered his assistance on condition that the Austrian consulate issued a Hebrew stamp and a special postmark for Petah Tikva. The stamp was designed by an unknown artist featuring a plow, green fields and a blossoming orange tree. The price was 14 [[Para (currency)|paras]] (a Turkish coin) and displayed the name 'Petah Tikva' in Hebrew letters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.auctionzip.com/auction-lot/An-envelope-with-a-Petah-Tikva-stamp,-signed-wit_A3B48448E5|title=Lot - An envelope with a Petah Tikva stamp, signed with a special stamp for this stamp|website=www.auctionzip.com|access-date=2019-11-06|archive-date=2019-11-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191106082038/https://www.auctionzip.com/auction-lot/An-envelope-with-a-Petah-Tikva-stamp,-signed-wit_A3B48448E5|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[David Ben Gurion]] lived in Petah Tikva for a few months on his arrival in [[Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem|Palestine]] in 1906. It had a population of around 1000, half of them farmers. He found occasional work in the orange groves.<ref>[[Tom Segev|Segev, Tom]] (2018 - 2019 translation [[Haim Watzman]]) ''A State at Any Cost. The Life of David Ben-Gurion.''

During the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] of [[World War I]], Petah Tikva served as a refugee town for residents of Tel Aviv and [[Jaffa]], following their exile by the Ottoman authorities. The town suffered heavily as it lay between the Ottoman and British fronts during the war.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

In the early 1920s, industry began to develop in the Petah Tikva region. In 1921, Petah Tikva was granted [[local council (Israel)|local council]] status by the British authorities. In May 1921, Petah Tikva was the target of an Arab attack, which left four of its Jewish inhabitants dead–an extension of the [[Jaffa riots of 1921]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/PLACES/pt.html|title=Petah Tikvah|publisher=[[Jewish Agency for Israel]]|access-date=October 21, 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121185310/http://www.jafi.org.il/education/100/PLACES/pt.html|archive-date=November 21, 2008}}</ref> In 1927, Petah Tikva concluded a local peace treaty with the Arabs living nearby; subsequently, Petah Tikva was untouched by the [[1929 Palestine riots]].

Petah Tikva, a center of citrus farming, was considered by both the British government and the Jaffa Electric Company as a potentially important consumer of electricity for irrigation. The Auja Concession, which was granted to the Jaffa Electric Company on 1921, specifically referred to the relatively large Jewish settlement of Petah-Tikva. But, it was only in late 1929 that the company submitted an irrigation scheme for Petah-Tikva, and it was yet to be approved by the government in 1930.<ref>{{cite book |last=Shamir |first=Ronen |date=2013 |title=Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=978-0-8047-8706-2}}</ref>

In the 1930s, the pioneering founders of [[Kibbutz Yavneh]] from the [[Religious Zionism|Religious Zionist movement]] immigrated to the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], settling near Petah Tikva on land purchased by a Jewish-owned German company. Refining the agricultural skills they learned in Germany, these pioneers began in 1941 to build their kibbutz in its intended location in the south of Israel, operating from Petah Tikva as a base.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aliyathanoar.massuah.org.il/Product.aspx?Product=39&Category=14&ln=en|title=Kevutsat Rodges (Kevutsat Yavne) est. 1929|publisher=Massuah, International Institute for Holocaust Studies|access-date=2019-08-27|archive-date=2021-02-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210224040422/http://aliyathanoar.massuah.org.il/Product.aspx?Product=39&Category=14&ln=en|url-status=live}}</ref>
