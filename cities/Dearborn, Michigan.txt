'''Dearborn''' is a city in [[Wayne County, Michigan]], United States. It is an inner-ring suburb in [[Metro Detroit]], bordering Detroit to the south and west, and roughly {{convert|7|mi|km|1}} west of [[downtown Detroit]]. In the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], it had a population of 109,976, ranking as the [[List of municipalities in Michigan|seventh-most populous city in Michigan]]. Dearborn is best known as the hometown of the [[Ford Motor Company]] and of its founder, [[Henry Ford]].

The first written settlement of Dearborn is from the 18th century by [[French Canadians|French Canadian]] [[voyageurs]] who initially called the settlement La Belle Fontaine or Place aux Fontaines because of the abundant [[Spring (hydrology)|springs]] in the city. Therefore, Dearborn was once named Springwells, an [[Anglicisation|anglicization]] of the French name.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1978 |title="The Dearborn Historian," Dearborn Historical Commission |url=https://dearbornhistoricalmuseum.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/vol-18-no-3.pdf |access-date=November 10, 2023 |archive-date=October 9, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241009043459/https://thedhm.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/vol-18-no-3.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> The settlement was connected to the Detroit River [[ribbon farm]] communities and other farms connected to the [[River Rouge (Michigan)|Rouge River]] and the [[Sauk Trail]]. The community grew in the 19th century with the establishment of the [[Commandant's Quarters (Dearborn, Michigan)|Detroit Arsenal]] on the [[U.S. Route 12 in Michigan#History|Chicago Road]] linking [[Detroit]] and [[Chicago]]. In the 20th century, it developed as a major manufacturing hub for the automotive industry.

[[Henry Ford]] was born on a farm that was once at the intersection of Ford Road and Greenfield Road. Ford later built his estate, [[Fair Lane]], and his [[Ford River Rouge complex|River Rouge Complex]], the largest factory of his empire, in Dearborn. He developed mass production of automobiles, and based the [[Ford World Headquarters|world headquarters]] of the [[Ford Motor Company]] here. The city has a campus of the [[University of Michigan–Dearborn|University of Michigan]], and [[Henry Ford College]]. [[The Henry Ford]] is the largest indoor-outdoor historic museum complex in the United States, and [[Metro Detroit]]'s leading tourist attraction.<ref>America's Story, Explore the States: Michigan (2006).

Dearborn residents are Americans primarily of European or Middle Eastern ancestry, many descendants of 19th and 20th-century immigrants. The census identifies primary European ethnicities as [[German Americans|German]], [[Polish Americans|Polish]], [[Irish Americans|Irish]], and [[Italian Americans|Italian]]. New waves of immigration came from the Middle East in the late 20th century, Muslims and Christians from [[Lebanese Americans|Lebanon]], [[Palestinian Americans|Palestine]], [[Syrian Americans|Syria]], [[Iraqi Americans|Iraq]], and [[Yemeni Americans|Yemen]]. Dearborn has the proportionally largest [[Muslim Americans|Muslim]] population in the United States and the [[List of mosques in the United States|largest mosque]] in North America.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://newlinesmag.com/reportage/looking-back-at-all-american-muslim/|title=Looking Back at 'All-American Muslim'|first=Dalia|last=Abdelwahab|date=November 4, 2024}}</ref><ref>Population of Michigan Cities, Villages, Townships, and Remainders of Townships. www.michigan.gov.{{better source needed|date=March 2024}}</ref>

==History==
Before European encounter, the area had been inhabited for thousands of years by successive [[Indigenous peoples|First Nations peoples]]. Historical tribes belonged mostly to the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]-language family, especially the [[Council of Three Fires]], the [[Potawatomi]] and related peoples. In contrast, the [[Wyandot people|Huron]] (Wyandot) were [[Iroquoian]] speaking. French colonists had a trading post at Fort Detroit and a settlement developed there in the colonial period. Another developed on the south side of the Detroit River in what is now southwestern Ontario, near a Huron mission village. French and French-Canadian colonists also established farms at Dearborn in this period. France ceded all of its territory east of the Mississippi River in North America to Great Britain in 1763 after losing to Britain in the [[Seven Years' War]].

Beginning in 1786, after the United States gained independence in the [[American Revolutionary War]], more European Americans entered this region, settling in Detroit and the Dearborn area.<ref>[http://www.dearbornarealiving.com/history.shtml "History"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070721023200/http://www.dearbornarealiving.com/history.shtml |date=July 21, 2007 }}, Dearborn Area Living, accessed May 15, 2010</ref> With population growth, Dearborn Township was formed in 1833 and the village of Dearbornville in 1836, each named after [[Henry Dearborn]], a general in the American Revolution who became [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] under President [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The Town of Dearborn was incorporated in 1893. Through much of the 19th century, the area was largely rural and dependent on agriculture.

Stimulated by industrial development in Detroit and within its own limits, in 1927 Dearborn was established as a city. Its current borders result from a 1928 consolidation vote that merged Dearborn and neighboring Fordson (previously known as [[Springwells Township, Michigan|Springwells]]), which feared being absorbed into expanding Detroit.

According to historian James W. Loewen, in his book ''[[Sundown Towns]]'' (2005), Dearborn discouraged African Americans from settling in the city. In the early 20th century, both white and black people migrated to Detroit for industrial jobs. Over time, some city residents relocated in the suburbs. Many of Dearborn's residents "took pride in the saying, 'The sun never set on a Negro in Dearborn'". According to [[Orville Hubbard]], the segregationist mayor of Dearborn from 1942 to 1978, "as far as he was concerned, it was against the law for a Negro to live in his suburb."<ref>{{cite book

The area between Dearborn and Fordson was undeveloped, and remains so in part. Once farm land, much of this property was bought by Henry Ford for his estate, [[Fair Lane]], and for the [[Ford Motor Company]] World Headquarters. Later developments in this corridor were the [[Ford Airport (Dearborn)|Ford airport]] (later converted to the [[Ford Proving Grounds|Dearborn Proving Grounds]]), and other Ford administrative and development facilities.

More recent additions are [[The Henry Ford]] (a reconstructed historic village and museum), the [[Henry Ford Centennial Library]], the super-regional shopping mall [[Fairlane Town Center]], and the Ford Performing Arts Center. The open land is planted with [[sunflower]]s and often with Ford's favorite crop of [[soybean]]s. The crops are never harvested.

The [[Arab American National Museum]] (AANM) opened in 2005, the first museum in the world devoted to Arab American history and culture. Arab Americans in Dearborn include descendants of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] Christians who immigrated in the early twentieth century to work in the auto industry, and more recent Arab immigrants and their descendants from other, primarily Muslim nations.<ref name="arabamericanmuseum1">{{cite web |url=http://www.arabamericanmuseum.org/About-the-Museum.id.3.htm |title=Arab American National Museum of Arab American History, Culture & Art |publisher=Arabamericanmuseum.org |access-date=April 9, 2009 |archive-date=February 21, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221125159/http://arabamericanmuseum.org/About-the-Museum.id.3.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On February 2, 2024, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' published an opinion piece titled "Welcome to Dearborn, America's Jihad Capital", claiming that there were a large number of supporters of Islamic extremism in the area. Mayor Abdullah Hammoud said the article was inflammatory and was responsible for increased online hate speech against the city's citizens, so he increased police patrols.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-02-03 |title=Dearborn mayor calls for increased police in response to Wall Street Journal opinion piece |url=https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2024/02/03/dearborn-mayor-increased-police-wall-street-journal-opinion/72465140007/ |work=Detroit Free Press |access-date=February 4, 2024 |archive-date=October 9, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20241009043345/https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/wayne/2024/02/03/dearborn-mayor-increased-police-wall-street-journal-opinion/72465140007/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|24.5|sqmi|km2}}, of which {{convert|24.4|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} (0.37%) is water. The city developed on both sides of the [[Rouge River (Michigan)|Rouge River]]. An artificial waterfall/low head dam was constructed by Henry Ford on his estate to power its powerhouse. The Upper, Middle, and Lower Branches of the river come together in Dearborn. The river is widened and channeled near the Rouge Plant to allow [[lake freighter]] access.

Fordson Island ({{Coord|42|17|38|N|83|08|52|W|}}) is an {{convert|8.4|acre|ha|abbr=off}} island about three miles (5&nbsp;km) upriver on the [[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]] from its confluence with the [[Detroit River]]. It is the only major island in a tributary to the Detroit River. It was created in 1922 when engineers dug a secondary trench to reroute the River Rouge to increase navigability for shipping purposes, and businesses needed it to be navigable by the large [[lake freighters]]. The island is privately owned, has no public access, and is part of the city of Dearborn which has no frontage along the Detroit River.<ref name=wayneislands>{{cite web|last=Buttle and Tuttle Ltd |title=Wayne County island place names |url=http://www.placenames.com/us/26163/island/ |date=2000–2008 |access-date=June 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527190313/http://www.placenames.com/us/26163/island/ |archive-date=May 27, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Heritage Newspapers |title=Dearborn Area Living: rivers, creeks, ditches |url=http://www.dearbornarealiving.com/topography.shtml |year=2009 |access-date=June 10, 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090629053419/http://www.dearbornarealiving.com/topography.shtml |archive-date=June 29, 2009 }}</ref>

Dearborn is among a small number of municipalities that own property in other cities. It owns the {{convert|626|acre|km2|adj=on}} [[Camp Dearborn]] in [[Milford, Michigan]], which is located {{convert|35|mi|km}} from Dearborn.<ref>[http://www.cityofdearborn.org/departments/recreation/campdearborn/camp_new/main.html Camp Dearborn] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090806035123/http://www.cityofdearborn.org/departments/recreation/campdearborn/camp_new/main.html |date=August 6, 2009 }}, Dearborn city website</ref><!-- When was this purchased and why? Volume of use? --> Dearborn was among an even smaller number of cities that hold property in another state. For a time, the city owned the Dearborn Towers apartment complex in [[Clearwater, Florida]], but this has been sold. Camp Dearborn is considered part of the city of Dearborn. Revenues generated by camp admissions are incorporated into the city's budget.

It is also a center of [[Maltese American]] settlement, from the Mediterranean island of Malta. Also attracted to jobs in the auto industry, some were among immigrant Maltese who first settled in [[Corktown, Detroit|Corktown]].<ref>''Maltese In Detroit'', Diane Gale Andreassi, Larry Zahra, Arcadia Publishing, February 28, 2011, p. 47</ref>

Dearborn's first public library opened in 1924 at the building now known as the Bryant Branch. This served as the main library until the Ford library opened in 1969. In 1970 what became known as the Mason building was classified as a branch library. The library was renamed in 1977 after Katharine Wright Bryant, who developed a plan for the library and campaigned for it.<ref>"[http://dearbornlibrary.org/aboutus/bryant.htm A LOOK AT THE Bryant Branch]."
