==History==
{{Main|History of Kentucky}}

===Native American settlement===
The first archaeological evidence of human occupation of Kentucky is approximately 9500BCE, and it was Clovis culture, primitive hunter-gatherers with stone tools. Around 1800 BCE, a gradual transition began from a hunter-gatherer economy to agriculturalism. Around 900 CE, a [[Mississippian culture]] took root in western and central Kentucky and a [[Fort Ancient]] culture appeared in eastern Kentucky. While the two had many similarities, the distinctive ceremonial earthwork mounds constructed in the former's centers were not part of the culture of the latter. Fort Ancient settlements depended largely on corn, beans, and squash, and practiced a system of agriculture that prevented ecological degradation by rotating crops, [[controlled burn|burning]] sections of forest to create ideal habitat for wild game, relocating villages every 10–30 years, and continually shifting the location of fields to maintain plots of land in various stages of [[ecological succession]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Patrick |first1=Andrew P. |title=Birth of the Bluegrass: Ecological Transformations in Central Kentucky to 1810 |journal=The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society |date=2017 |volume=115 |issue=2 |pages=155–182|doi=10.1353/khs.2017.0049 |s2cid=133557743 }}</ref>

In about the 10th century, the Kentucky native people's variety of corn became highly productive, supplanting the [[Eastern Agricultural Complex]] and replacing it with maize-based agriculture in the [[Mississippian culture|Mississippian era]]. As of the 16th century, what became Kentucky was home to tribes from diverse linguistic groups. The [[Kispoko]], an [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian-speaking]] tribe, controlled much of the interior of the state.<ref>Louis, Franquelin, Jean Baptiste. "Franquelin's map of Louisiana.". LOC.gov. Retrieved August 17, 2017.</ref>

French explorers in the 17th century documented numerous tribes living in Kentucky until the [[Beaver Wars]] in the 1670s; however, by the time that European colonial explorers and settlers began entering Kentucky in greater numbers in the mid-18th century, there were no major Native American settlements in the region.

The [[Chickasaw]] had territory up to the confluence of Mississippi and Ohio rivers. During a period known as the [[Beaver Wars]] (1640–1680), another Algonquian tribe called the [[Maumee people|Maumee]], or [[Mascouten]] was chased out of southern Michigan.<ref>"Early Indian Migration in Ohio." GenealogyTrails.com. Retrieved August 17, 2017.</ref> The vast majority of them moved to Kentucky, pushing the Kispoko east and war broke out with the [[Tutelo]] of North Carolina and Virginia that pushed them further north and east. The Maumee were closely related to the [[Miami people|Miami]] from Indiana. Later, the Kispoko merged with the [[Shawnee]], who migrated from the east and the Ohio River valley.

A persistent myth, perpetuated in many popular and scholarly works, alleges that Native Americans never lived permanently in Kentucky, but rather used it only as a "hunting ground."<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Henderson |first1=A. Gwynn |title=Dispelling the Myth: Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Indian Life in Kentucky |journal=The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society |date=2018 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=1–25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Native Americans of Clay County & Kentucky |url=https://www.claycountykentucky.org/history/indians/ |website=claycountykentucky.org}}</ref> According to early Kentucky historians, early European settlers encountered extensive evidence of permanent, advanced settlements, including numerous burial mounds, [[copper]] and stone [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]], and what early historians describe as "fortifications:" large sites consisting of extensive walls enclosing the flat tops of bluffs, cliffs or mountains, constructed from stone that was [[quarry|quarried]] in the surrounding valleys and brought up to the summit.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cotterill |first1=Robert S. |title=History of Pioneer Kentucky |date=1917 |publisher=Johnson & Hardin |location=Cincinnati |pages=36–37}}</ref> These sites and artifacts were sometimes explained as being the remnants of a "lost" white race,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cotterill |first1=Robert S. |title=History of Pioneer Kentucky |date=1917 |publisher=Johnson & Hardin |location=Cincinnati |page=30}}</ref> or some variously identified ethnic group predating and distinct from the Native Americans.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ranck |first1=George W. |title=History of Lexington Kentucky |date=1872 |publisher=Robert Clarke & Co |location=Cincinnati |page=12}}</ref> More recent scholarship identifies the mound builders as the Mississippian and Fort Ancient peoples, which were distinct from the indigenous cultures encountered by settlers, although sharing the same origin in Paleoindian groups that inhabited the area for at least 12,000 years.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Henderson |first1=A. Gwynn |title=Dispelling the Myth: Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Indian Life in Kentucky |journal=The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society |date=2018 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=6–7}}</ref>

Beginning in the seventeenth century, before indigenous groups in Kentucky made direct contact with Europeans, articles of European origin such as glass [[bead]]s entered the region via [[trade route]]s, and the appearance of [[mass grave]]s suggests that European diseases were also introduced.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Henderson |first1=A. Gwynn |title=Dispelling the Myth: Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Indian Life in Kentucky |journal=The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society |date=2018 |volume=90 |issue=1 |page=17}}</ref> By the eighteenth century, epidemics of disease had destabilized and changed the indigenous groups that inhabited Kentucky, causing some to reassemble into multi-tribal towns, and others to [[Human migration|disperse]] further from the sphere of European influence.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Henderson |first1=A. Gwynn |title=Dispelling the Myth: Seventeenth- and Eighteenth-Century Indian Life in Kentucky |journal=The Register of the Kentucky Historical Society |date=2018 |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=18–22}}</ref> Around the end of the French and Indian War, as European settlers began to claim parts of the Bluegrass, Native Americans abandoned their larger, more permanent villages south of the Ohio River and continued to maintain only small or transient settlements. This upheaval likely led the settlers to believe that Kentucky was a hunting ground contested by multiple tribes but not permanently inhabited, when in reality it had only recently been abandoned due to social and political turmoil.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Henderson |first1=A.

===Early explorations: the discovery of Kentucky===
{{See also|Kentucke's Frontiers}}
European explorers arrived in Kentucky possibly as early as 1671. While French explorers surely spied Kentucky during expeditions on the Mississippi, there is no evidence French or Spanish explorers set foot in the lands south of the Ohio, notwithstanding speculations about Hernando de Soto and Robert de la Salle. The terrain in those days was not surveyed, so there is some uncertainty whether and to what extent the early English explorers out of Virginia set foot on the land. Confounding the issue is that the region south of the Ohio/Allegheny later known as ''Kentucke country'' was larger than the state of Kentucky today, encompassing most of today's West Virginia and (vaguely) part of southwestern Pennsylvania.<ref>"South of the Ohio" was almost, but not quite, synonymous with ''Kentucke country''.</ref> Notable expeditions were Batts and Fallam 1671, Needham and Arthur 1673.<ref>The First Explorations of the Trans-Allegheny Region by the Virginians 1650–1674</ref> Dr. Thomas Walker and surveyor Christopher Gist surveyed the area now known as Kentucky in 1750 and 1751.

===European settlement: The Treaty of Fort Stanwix 1768===
{{further|Transylvania Colony|Lord Dunmore's War|Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1768)}}
{{See also|Indian Reserve (1763)}}
As more settlers entered the area, warfare broke out with the Native Americans over their traditional hunting grounds.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.merceronline.com/Native/native01.htm |title=The Presence |publisher=Mercer County Online |access-date=November 29, 2006 |website=History of Native Americans in Central Kentucky |archive-date=December 12, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212023438/http://www.merceronline.com/Native/native01.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

June 16, 1774, James Harrod founded Harrod's Town (modern Harrodsburg). The settlement was abandoned during the conflict period of Dunmore's War, and resettled in March 1775, becoming the first permanent European settlement in Kentucky. It was followed within months by Boone's Station, Logan's Fort and Lexington before Kentucky was organized.

This period was the time of Daniel Boone's legendary expeditions starting in 1767 through the Cumberland Gap and down the Kentucky River to reach the bluegrass heartland of Kentucky.

While the [[Cherokee]] did not settle in Kentucky, they hunted there. They relinquished their hunting rights there in an extra-legal private contract with speculator Richard Henderson called ''[[Treaty of Sycamore Shoals]]'' in 1775.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Murphree |first1=Daniel S. |title=Native America: A State-by-State Historical Encyclopedia |date=2012 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Santa Barbara, CA |isbn=9780313381270 |page=395 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0UNzFCOYTU4C |access-date=March 19, 2023 |archive-date=March 26, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230326164802/https://books.google.com/books?id=0UNzFCOYTU4C |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Kentucky County and the Cherokee-American wars===
{{Further information|Kentucky County, Virginia|Cherokee-American wars|Fort Nelson (Kentucky)|History of Louisville, Kentucky}}

On December 31, 1776, by an act of the [[Virginia General Assembly]], the portion of [[Fincastle County]] west of the [[Big Sandy River (Ohio River)|Big Sandy River]] (including today's [[Tug Fork]] tributary) terminating at the North Carolina border (today Tennessee) extending to the Mississippi River, previously most of what was known as ''Kentucky (or Kentucke) country'', was split off into its own county of [[Kentucky County, Virginia|Kentucky]]. Harrod's Town (Oldtown as it was known at the time) was named the county seat.

A 1790 U.S. government report states that 1,500{{spaces}}Kentucky settlers had been killed by Native Americans since the end of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James, James Alton|title=The Life of George Rogers Clark|location= Chicago|publisher= [[University of Chicago Press]]|year= 1928|isbn=978-0-404-03549-5}}</ref>

===Statehood===
[[File:Kentucky Statehood 150th Anniversary, 3c, 1942 issue.jpg|thumb
|In 1942 the U.S. Post Office issued a postage stamp [[commemorative stamp|commemorating]] the 150th anniversary of Kentucky statehood, a 3-cent 1942 issue]]
The county was subdivided into [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson]], [[Lincoln County, Kentucky|Lincoln]] and [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette]] Counties in 1780, but continued to be administered as the District of Kentucky even as new counties were split off.

On several occasions the region's residents petitioned the General Assembly and the [[Congress of the Confederation|Confederation Congress]] for separation from Virginia and [[U.S. state|statehood]]. Ten constitutional conventions were held in [[Danville, Kentucky|Danville]] between 1784 and 1792.
One petition, which had Virginia's assent, came before the Confederation Congress in early July 1788. Unfortunately, its consideration came up a day after word of [[New Hampshire]]'s all-important ninth [[Article Seven of the United States Constitution|ratification]] of the proposed [[United States Constitution|Constitution]], thus establishing it as the new framework of governance for the United States. In light of this development, Congress thought that it would be "unadvisable" to admit Kentucky into the Union, as it could do so "under the Articles of Confederation" only, but not "under the Constitution", and so declined to take action.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Kesavan|first1=Vasan|title=When Did the Articles of Confederation Cease to Be Law|journal=Notre Dame Law Review|date=December 1, 2002|volume=78|issue=1|pages=70–71|url=http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol78/iss1/3|access-date=October 31, 2015|archive-date=January 1, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101052616/http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol78/iss1/3/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The central [[Bluegrass region]] and the western portion of the state were the areas with the most [[History of slavery in Kentucky|slave owners]]. [[Planter (American South)|Planters]] cultivated [[tobacco]] and [[Hemp in Kentucky|hemp]] on plantations with the use of slave labor, and were noted for their quality [[livestock]]. During the 19th century, Kentucky slaveholders began to sell unneeded slaves to the [[Deep South]], with Louisville becoming a major slave market and departure port for slaves being transported down the Ohio River.

===The Civil War===

Kentucky was a heavily divided slave state during the [[American Civil War]]. Though the state had dueling Union and Confederate state governments, Kentucky was never an official component of the Confederacy. [[Kentucky in the American Civil War|Kentucky was one of]] the Southern [[Border states (American Civil War)|border states]] during the war, and it remained neutral within the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Border States in the Civil War | date=February 15, 2002 | publisher=CivilWarHome.com | url=http://www.civilwarhome.com/borderstates.htm | access-date=November 29, 2006 | archive-date=December 8, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061208033207/http://www.civilwarhome.com/borderstates.htm }}</ref> Despite this, representatives from 68 of 110 counties met at [[Russellville, Kentucky|Russellville]] calling themselves the "Convention of the People of Kentucky" and passed an [[Ordinance of Secession]] on November 20, 1861.<ref>{{cite web | title=Ordinances of Secession | publisher=Historical Text Archive | url=http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&artid=170 | access-date=November 29, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123052735/http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&artid=170 | archive-date=November 23, 2010 | url-status=dead | df=mdy-all }}</ref> They established a [[Confederate government of Kentucky]] with its capital in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]], and Kentucky was officially admitted into the Confederacy on December 10, 1861, as the 13th Confederate state with full recognition in Richmond.<ref>{{cite web | title=Civil War Sites – Bowling Green, KY | publisher=WMTH Corporation | url=http://www.trailsrus.com/monuments/reg3/bowling_green.html | access-date=November 29, 2006 | archive-date=October 9, 2007 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009101515/http://www.trailsrus.com/monuments/reg3/bowling_green.html | url-status=live }}</ref> The Confederate shadow government was never popularly elected statewide, though 116 delegates were sent representing 68 Kentucky counties which at the time made up a little over half the territory of the Commonwealth to the Russellville Convention in 1861, and were occupied and governed by the Confederacy at some point in the duration of the war, and Kentucky had full representation within the Confederate Government. Although Confederate forces briefly controlled Frankfort, they were expelled by Union forces before a Confederate government could be installed in the state capital. After the expulsion of Confederate forces after the Battle of Perryville, this government operated in-exile. Though it existed throughout the war, Kentucky's provisional government only had governing authority in areas of Kentucky under direct Confederate control and had very little effect on the events in the Commonwealth or in the war once they were driven out of the state.

Kentucky remained officially "neutral" throughout the war{{citation needed|date=May 2023}} due to the [[Southern Unionists]] sympathies of a majority of the Commonwealth's citizens who were split between the struggle of Kentucky's sister Southern States fully in the [[Confederate States of America]] and a continued loyalty to the Unionist cause that was prevalent in other areas of the South such as in East Tennessee, West Virginia, Western North Carolina, and others. Despite this, some 21st-century Kentuckians observe [[Confederate Memorial Day]] on [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] leader [[Jefferson Davis]]' birthday, June 3, and participate in Confederate battle re-enactments.<ref>{{cite web | title=KRS 2.110 Public Holidays | publisher=[[Kentucky General Assembly]] | url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/KRS/002-00/110.PDF | access-date=November 29, 2006 | archive-date=September 27, 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060927011246/http://www.lrc.ky.gov/KRS/002-00/110.PDF | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>Tony Hiss, ''Confederates in the Attic''</ref> Both Davis and U.S. president [[Abraham Lincoln]] were born in Kentucky.

Henry W. Grady, editor of the Atlanta Constitution, coined the term ''New South'' in 1874, urging transformation from an agrarian economy to a modern industrial one.

On January 30, 1900, Governor [[William Goebel]], flanked by two bodyguards, was mortally wounded by an [[assassination|assassin]] while walking to the State Capitol in downtown Frankfort. Goebel was contesting the [[Kentucky gubernatorial election, 1899|Kentucky gubernatorial election of 1899]], which [[William S. Taylor (Kentucky politician)|William S. Taylor]] was initially believed to have won. For several months, [[J. C. W. Beckham]], Goebel's running mate, and Taylor fought over who was the legal governor until the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in May in favor of Beckham. After fleeing to [[Indiana]], Taylor was indicted as a co-conspirator in Goebel's [[assassination]].

The [[Black Patch Tobacco Wars]], a vigilante action, occurred in Western Kentucky in the early 20th century. As a result of the [[tobacco industry]] monopoly, tobacco farmers in the area were forced to sell their crops at prices that were too low. Many local farmers and activists united in a refusal to sell their crops to the major tobacco companies.

An Association meeting occurred in downtown [[Guthrie, Kentucky|Guthrie]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wkms.org/post/understanding-black-patch-tobacco-war-west-kentucky-and-tennessee#stream/0|title=Understanding the Black Patch Tobacco War of West Kentucky and Tennessee|publisher=[[WKMS]]|last1=Lochte|first1=Kate|last2=Markgraf|first2=Matt|date=September 22, 2014|access-date=May 6, 2016|archive-date=June 10, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160610004656/http://wkms.org/post/understanding-black-patch-tobacco-war-west-kentucky-and-tennessee#stream/0|url-status=live}}</ref> where a vigilante wing of "Night Riders", formed. The riders terrorized farmers who sold their tobacco at the low prices demanded by the tobacco corporations. They burned several tobacco warehouses throughout the area, stretching as far west as [[Hopkinsville, Kentucky|Hopkinsville]] to [[Princeton, Kentucky|Princeton]]. In the later period of their operation, they were known to physically assault farmers who broke the boycott. Governor [[Augustus E. Willson]] declared [[martial law]] and deployed the [[Kentucky National Guard]] to end the wars.

Kentucky can be divided into five primary regions: the [[Cumberland Plateau]] in the east, which is wholly underlain by coal and constitutes the Eastern Coal Field; the north-central [[Bluegrass region]], where the major cities and the capital are located; the south-central and western [[Pennyroyal Plateau]] (a Mississippian-age plateau that is divided into eastern, central and western sub-regions, the latter known as the Pennyrile); the [[Western Coal Field]]; and the far-western [[Jackson Purchase]], the northernmost extension of the Mississippian Embayment, west and south of the Tennessee River.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gnadinger |first=Zac |date=February 13, 2023 |title=The Ecological Regions of Kentucky |url=https://www.kynativeplants.com/post/ecological-regions-of-kentucky |access-date=December 17, 2023 |website=KY Native Plants |language=en |archive-date=December 17, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231217184609/https://www.kynativeplants.com/post/ecological-regions-of-kentucky |url-status=live }}</ref>

Much of the outer Bluegrass is in the [[Eden Shale Hills]] sub-region, made up of short, steep, and very narrow hills.

Kentucky's {{convert|90000|mi|km|-4}} of streams provides one of the most expansive and complex stream systems in the nation.

===Natural environment and conservation===
[[File:WaterfrontPkDwnt.jpg|thumb|Once an industrial area, Louisville's waterfront has thousands of trees and miles of walking trails.]]

Kentucky hosts multiple habitats with a high number of [[endemic]] species, including some of the most extensive cave systems in the world. 102 known species are endemic to the state.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Abernathy |first1=Greg |last2=White |first2=Deborah |last3=Laudermilk |first3=Ellis L. |last4=Evans |first4=Marc |title=Kentucky's Natural Heritage: An Illustrated Guide to Biodiversity |date=2010 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky |pages=42–43}}</ref> The Bluegrass region, which is believed to have once been a lush open woodland environment similar to [[oak savanna]] with abundant thickets of [[Arundinaria gigantea|river cane]], a species of [[bamboo]], was once described by [[E.

Kentucky has an expansive park system, which includes one national park, two National Recreation Areas, two National Historic Parks, two [[United States National Forest|national forests]], two National Wildlife Refuges, 45 [[state park]]s, {{convert|37896|acre|km2|0}} of state forest, and 82 [[wildlife management area]]s.

Kentucky has been part of two of the most successful wildlife reintroduction projects in United States history. In the winter of 1997, the [[Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources]] began to re-stock [[elk]] in the state's eastern counties, which had been extirpated from the area for over 150 years. {{as of|2009}}, the herd had reached the project goal of 10,000 animals, making it the largest herd east of the [[Mississippi River]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://fw.ky.gov/elkinfo.asp?lid=1653&NavPath=C117C147C301C547 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926064155/http://fw.ky.gov/elkinfo.asp?lid=1653&NavPath=C117C147C301C547 |archive-date=September 26, 2006 |title=Elk Restoration Update and Hunting Information |publisher=Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources |access-date=December 9, 2006 }}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==

===Counties===

{{See also|List of counties in Kentucky|Fiscal Court}}

Kentucky is subdivided into 120 [[county (United States)|counties]], the largest being [[Pike County, Kentucky|Pike County]] at {{convert|787.6|sqmi|km2}}, and the most populous being [[Jefferson County, Kentucky|Jefferson County]] (which [[Consolidated city–county|coincides with]] the [[Louisville Metro Council|Louisville Metro governmental area]]) with 772,144 residents {{as of|2023|lc=y}}.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kentucky Counties |url=http://www.uky.edu/KentuckyAtlas/kentucky-counties.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706080928/http://www.uky.edu/KentuckyAtlas/kentucky-counties.html |archive-date=July 6, 2013 |website=Kentucky Atlas & Gazetteer |publisher=University of Kentucky}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-counties-total.html#v2023|title=Annual Estimates of the Resident Population for Counties: April 1, 2020 to July 1, 2023|publisher=United States Census Bureau|access-date=March 14, 2024|archive-date=March 18, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240318232436/https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/popest/2020s-counties-total.html#v2023|url-status=live}}</ref>

County government, under the [[Constitution of Kentucky|Kentucky Constitution]] of 1891, is vested in the [[County Judge/Executive]], (formerly called the County Judge) who serves as the [[Executive (government)|executive]] head of the county, and a [[legislature]] called a [[Fiscal Court]]. Despite the unusual name, the Fiscal Court no longer has [[judiciary|judicial]] functions.

===Consolidated city-county governments===

Kentucky's two most populous counties, Jefferson and Fayette, have their [[Consolidated city-county|governments consolidated with the governments of their largest cities]]. ''Louisville-Jefferson County Government'' ([[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville Metro]]) and ''Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government'' ([[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington Metro]]) are unique in that their city councils and county Fiscal Court structures have been merged into a single entity with a single [[mayor|chief executive]], the [[Louisville Metro Mayor|Metro Mayor]] and Urban County Mayor, respectively. Although the counties still exist as subdivisions of the state, in reference the names Louisville and Lexington are used to refer to the entire area coextensive with the former cities and counties.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cgr.org/consensuscny/docs/CaseStudies_cd-louisvillemerger1013.pdf |title=A 10-Year Perspective of the Merger of Louisville and Jefferson County, KY: Louisville Metro Vaults From 65th to 18th Largest City in the Nation |last=Wachter |first=Jeff |publisher=CGR |date=September 2013 |access-date=January 5, 2024 |archive-date=February 14, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240214082623/https://www.cgr.org/consensuscny/docs/CaseStudies_cd-louisvillemerger1013.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://louisvilleky.gov/government/metro-council-district-17/what-metro-council |title=What is Metro Council? |publisher=Louisville-Jefferson County Metro Government |access-date=January 5, 2024 |archive-date=December 17, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231217185605/https://louisvilleky.gov/government/metro-council-district-17/what-metro-council |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Organizational structure, system and positions |url=https://www.lexingtonky.gov/organizational-structure-system-and-positions |access-date=December 17, 2023 |publisher=Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government |archive-date=December 17, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231217185604/https://www.lexingtonky.gov/organizational-structure-system-and-positions |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Louisville metropolitan area|Metro Louisville]] government area has a 2018 population of 1,298,990. Under [[United States Census Bureau]] methodology, the population of Louisville was 623,867. The latter figure is the population of the so-called [[Louisville/Jefferson County metro government (balance), Kentucky|"balance"]]{{snd}}the parts of Jefferson County that were either unincorporated or within the City of Louisville before the formation of the merged government in 2003. In 2018 the [[Louisville metropolitan area|Louisville Combined Statistical Area]] (CSA) had a population of 1,569,112; including 1,209,191 in Kentucky, which means more than 25% of the state's population now lives in the Louisville CSA. Since 2000, over one-third of the state's population growth has occurred in the Louisville CSA. In addition, the top 28 wealthiest places in Kentucky are in Jefferson County and seven of the 15 wealthiest counties in the state are located in the Louisville CSA.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ksdc.louisville.edu/|title=Kentucky State Data Center|publisher=Ksdc.louisville.edu|access-date=August 4, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828171408/http://www.ksdc.louisville.edu/|archive-date=August 28, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>{{Nonspecific|date=March 2017}}

The state's second-largest city is Lexington with a 2018 census population of 323,780, its metro had a population of 516,697, and its [[Lexington–Fayette–Frankfort–Richmond, KY Combined Statistical Area|CSA]], which includes the [[Frankfort, Kentucky micropolitan area|Frankfort]] and [[Richmond–Berea micropolitan area|Richmond]] statistical areas, having a population of 746,310. The [[Northern Kentucky]] area, which comprises the seven Kentucky counties in the [[Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky metropolitan area]], had a population of 447,457 in 2018. The metropolitan areas of Louisville, Lexington, and Northern Kentucky have a combined population of 2,402,958 {{as of|2018|lc=y}}, which is 54% of the state's total population on only about 19% of the state's land. This area is often referred to as the Golden triangle as it contains a majority of the state's wealth, population, population growth, and economic growth, it is where most of the state's largest cities by population are located. It is referred to as the Golden triangle as the metro areas of Lexington, Louisville, and Northern Kentucky/Cincinnati outline a triangle shape. Interstates I-71, I-75, and I-64 form the triangle shape. Additionally, all counties in Kentucky that are part of an MSA or CSA have a total population of 2,970,694, which is 67% of the state's population.

{{as of|2017}} [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] had a population of 67,067, making it the third most populous city in the state. The [[Bowling Green metropolitan area]] had an estimated population of 174,835; and the [[combined statistical area]] it shares with [[Glasgow, Kentucky|Glasgow]] has an estimated population of 228,743.

The two other fast-growing urban areas in Kentucky are the [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] area and the "Tri-Cities Region" of southeastern Kentucky, comprising [[Somerset, Kentucky|Somerset]], [[London, Kentucky|London]] and [[Corbin, Kentucky|Corbin]].

Although only one town in the "Tri-Cities" (Somerset) currently has more than 12,000 people, the area has been experiencing heightened population and job growth since the 1990s. Growth has been especially rapid in Laurel County, which outgrew areas such as Scott and Jessamine counties around Lexington or Shelby and Nelson Counties around Louisville. London significantly grew in population in the 2000s, from 5,692 in 2000 to 7,993 in 2010. London landed a [[Walmart|Wal-Mart]] distribution center in 1997, bringing thousands of jobs to the community.

In northeast Kentucky, the greater [[Ashland, Kentucky|Ashland]] area is an important transportation, manufacturing, and medical center. [[Iron and steel industry|Iron]] and [[petroleum]] production, as well as the transport of coal by rail and [[barge]], have been historical pillars of the region's economy. Due to a decline in the area's industrial base, Ashland has seen a sizable reduction in its population since 1990; however, the population of the area has since stabilized with the medical service industry taking a greater role in the local economy. The Ashland area, including the counties of [[Boyd County, Kentucky|Boyd]] and [[Greenup County, Kentucky|Greenup]], is part of the [[Huntington-Ashland, WV-KY-OH, Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (MSA). As of the 2000 census, the MSA had a population of 288,649. More than 21,000 of those people ({{as of|2010|lc=y}}) reside within the city limits of Ashland.

The largest county in Kentucky by area is [[Pike County, Kentucky|Pike]], which contains [[Pikeville, Kentucky|Pikeville]] and suburb [[Coal Run Village, Kentucky|Coal Run Village]]. The county and surrounding area is the most populated region in the state that is not part of a [[United States Micropolitan Statistical Area|Micropolitan Statistical Area]] or a [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] containing nearly 200,000 people in five counties: [[Floyd County, Kentucky|Floyd County]], [[Martin County, Kentucky|Martin County]], [[Letcher County, Kentucky|Letcher County]], and neighboring [[Mingo County, West Virginia]]. Pike County contains slightly more than 68,000 people.

Only three U.S. states have capitals with smaller populations than Kentucky's [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]] (pop. 25,527): [[Augusta, Maine]] (pop. 18,560), [[Pierre, South Dakota]] (pop. 13,876), and [[Montpelier, Vermont]] (pop. 8,035).

This includes a natural increase since the last census of 73,541 people (that is 346,968 births minus 273,427 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 26,135 people into the state. [[Immigration to the United States|Immigration]] from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 40,051 people, and migration within the country produced a net decrease of 13,916 people. {{as of|2015}}, Kentucky's population included about 149,016 foreign-born persons (3.4%).

===Language===
In 2000, 96% of all residents of the state five years old and older spoke only [[American English|English]] at home, a small decrease from 98% in 1990. Speech patterns in the state generally reflect the first settlers' Virginia backgrounds. South Midland features are best preserved in the mountains, with [[Southern American English|Southern]] in most other areas of Kentucky, but some common to Midland and Southern are widespread. After a vowel, the /r/ may be weak or missing. For instance, ''Coop'' has the vowel of ''put'', but the root rhymes with ''boot''. In southern Kentucky, earthworms are called ''redworms'', a burlap bag is known as a ''tow sack'' or the ''Southern grass sack'', and green beans are called ''snap beans''. In Kentucky English, a young man may ''carry'', not escort, his girlfriend to a party.{{Citation needed|date=January 2024}}

All classes of property, unless exempted by the Constitution, are taxed by the state, although at widely varying rates.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://revenue.ky.gov/business/proptax.htm| title = Property Tax| access-date = May 1, 2007| publisher = Kentucky Department of Revenue| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070403180310/http://revenue.ky.gov/business/proptax.htm| archive-date = April 3, 2007}}</ref> Many of these classes are exempted from taxation by local government. Of the classes that are subject to local taxation, three have special rates set by the [[Kentucky General Assembly|General Assembly]], one by the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]] and the remaining classes are subject to the full local rate, which includes the tax rate set by the local taxing bodies plus all voted levies. Real property is assessed on 100% of the fair market value and property taxes are due by December 31. Once the primary source of state and local government revenue, property taxes now account for only about 6% of the Kentucky's annual General Fund revenues.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bankrate.com/yho/itax/edit/state/profiles/state_tax_Ky.asp |title=State Taxes – Kentucky – Overview |access-date=May 1, 2007 |publisher=bankrate.com |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070408040707/http://www.bankrate.com/yho/itax/edit/state/profiles/state_tax_Ky.asp |archive-date=April 8, 2007 |url-status=dead }}

Until January 1, 2006, Kentucky imposed a tax on intangible personal property held by a taxpayer on January{{spaces}}1 of each year. The Kentucky intangible tax was repealed under House Bill 272.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.lrc.ky.gov/record/05rs/HB272.htm| title = Text of the House Bill 272| access-date = August 10, 2007| publisher = State of Kentucky| archive-date = August 11, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070811212831/http://www.lrc.ky.gov/record/05rs/hb272.htm| url-status = dead}}</ref> Intangible property consisted of any property or investment that represents evidence of value or the right to value. Some types of intangible property included: bonds, notes, retail [[repurchase agreement]]s, accounts receivable, trusts, enforceable contracts sale of real estate (land contracts), money in hand, money in [[safe deposit box]]es, annuities, interests in estates, loans to stockholders, and commercial paper.

In 2023, Kentucky launched a regulated local and online sports betting industry.

Tourism has become an increasingly important part of the Kentucky economy. In 2019 tourism grew to $7.6{{spaces}}billion in economic impact. Key attractions include [[horse racing]] with events like [[the Kentucky Derby]] and the [[Keeneland]] Fall and Spring Meets, [[Kentucky Bourbon Trail|bourbon]] distillery tours, including along the [[Kentucky Bourbon Trail]] and Louisville Urban Bourbon Trail,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Louisville, KY's Urban Bourbon Trail (UBT) |url=https://www.bourboncountry.com/things-to-do/urban-bourbon-trail/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219050143/http://www.bourboncountry.com/things-to-do/urban-bourbon-trail/index.aspx |archive-date=February 19, 2015 |access-date=July 2, 2022 |website=BourbonCounty.com}}</ref> and natural attractions such as the state's many lakes and parks to include [[Mammoth Cave]], [[Lake Cumberland State Resort Park|Lake Cumberland]] and [[Red River Gorge]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lanereport.com/116031/2019/08/kentucky-tourism-announces-increased-visitor-growth-and-spending-in-2018/|title=Kentucky Tourism says visitor spending rose to $7.6 billion in 2018|date=August 14, 2019|access-date=August 26, 2020|archive-date=September 14, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190914053739/https://www.lanereport.com/116031/2019/08/kentucky-tourism-announces-increased-visitor-growth-and-spending-in-2018/|url-status=live}}</ref>

The state also has several religious destinations such as the [[Creation Museum]] and [[Ark Encounter]] of [[Answers in Genesis]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Itinerary: Northern Kentucky Biblical Wonders |url=https://www.kentuckytourism.com/culture/spirituality/spiritual-itineraries/northern-kentucky-biblical-wonders |access-date=September 20, 2020 |archive-date=September 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918144205/https://www.kentuckytourism.com/culture/spirituality/spiritual-itineraries/northern-kentucky-biblical-wonders |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Answers in Genesis|url=https://answersingenesis.org/|access-date=September 20, 2020|archive-date=February 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220152012/https://answersingenesis.org/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In December 2002, the Kentucky governor [[Paul E.

Though it was meant to embrace southern values, many Kentuckians rejected the slogan as cheesy and generic.<ref name="nbcnews.com" /> It was seen that the slogan did not encourage tourism as much as initially hoped for. 

In 2004, then Governor [[Ernie Fletcher]] launched a comprehensive [[brand]]ing campaign with the hope of making the state's $12–14{{spaces}}million advertising budget more effective.<ref>{{cite web|title = Branding campaign puts Kentucky in step with national trend – Louisville – Louisville Business First|url = http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2004/12/06/story3.html|website = Louisville Business First|access-date = November 27, 2015|archive-date = January 1, 2016|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20160101052615/http://www.bizjournals.com/louisville/stories/2004/12/06/story3.html|url-status = live}}</ref> The resulting "Unbridled Spirit" brand was the result of a $500,000 contract with New West, a Kentucky-based public relations advertising and marketing firm, to develop a viable brand and tag line.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/02/business/02addes.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | title='Unbridled Spirit' Wins Kentucky Slogan Vote | date=December 2, 2004 | access-date=February 19, 2017 | archive-date=February 18, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218191446/http://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/02/business/02addes.html?_r=0 | url-status=live }}</ref> The Fletcher administration aggressively marketed the brand in both the public and private sectors.

Kentucky maintains eight public four-year universities. There are two general tiers: major research institutions (the [[University of Kentucky]] and the [[University of Louisville]]) and regional universities, which encompass the remaining six schools. The regional schools have specific target counties that many of their programs are targeted towards (such as Forestry at [[Eastern Kentucky University]] or Cave Management at [[Western Kentucky University]]), however, most of their curriculum varies little from any other public university.

The University of Kentucky (UK) and the University of Louisville (UofL) have the highest academic rankings and admissions standards although the regional schools are not without their national recognized departments{{snd}}examples being Western Kentucky University's nationally ranked Journalism Department or [[Morehead State University]] offering one of the nation's only Space Science degrees. UK is the flagship and land grant of the system and has agriculture extension services in every county. The two research schools split duties related to the medical field, UK handles all medical outreach programs in the eastern half of the state while UofL does all medical outreach in the state's western half.

The state's sixteen public two-year colleges have been governed by the [[Kentucky Community and Technical College System]] since the passage of the Postsecondary Education Improvement Act of 1997, commonly referred to as House Bill 1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/recarch/97ss/HB1/bill.doc |title=Postsecondary Education Improvement Act of 1997 |access-date=May 1, 2007 |publisher=State of Kentucky |archive-date=June 5, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605025349/http://www.lrc.ky.gov/recarch/97ss/HB1/bill.doc |url-status=dead }}</ref> Before the passage of House Bill 1, most of these colleges were under the control of the [[University of Kentucky]].

[[Transylvania University]], a liberal arts university located in Lexington, was founded in 1780 as the oldest university west of the [[Allegheny Mountains]].

[[Berea College]], located at the extreme southern edge of the Bluegrass below the Cumberland Plateau, was the first coeducational college in the [[Southern United States|South]] to admit both Black and white students, doing so from its very establishment in 1855.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.diversityweb.org/digest/vol10no1/mendel.cfm |title=Berea College:Learning, Labor, and Service |access-date=May 1, 2007 |publisher=Diversity Web |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705210337/http://www.diversityweb.org/digest/vol10no1/mendel.cfm |archive-date=July 5, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A state law in 1904 ended integration, and the law was upheld by the United States Supreme Court in the case of ''[[Berea College v.

{{See also|List of Kentucky State Highways}}

Kentucky is served by six major [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]] ([[Interstate 24 in Kentucky|I-24]], [[Interstate 64 in Kentucky|I-64]], [[Interstate 65 in Kentucky|I-65]], [[Interstate 69 in Kentucky|I-69]], [[Interstate 71 in Kentucky|I-71]], and [[Interstate 75 in Kentucky|I-75]]), seven [[:Category:Kentucky parkway system|parkways]], and six bypasses and spurs ([[Interstate 165 (Kentucky)|I-165]], [[Interstate 169 (Kentucky)|I-169]], [[Interstate 264 (Kentucky)|I-264]], [[Interstate 265|I-265]], [[Interstate 275 (Ohio–Indiana–Kentucky)|I-275]], and [[Interstate 471|I-471]]). The parkways were originally [[toll road]]s, but on November 22, 2006, Governor [[Ernie Fletcher]] ended the toll charges on the [[William H. Natcher Parkway]] and the [[Audubon Parkway]], the last two parkways in Kentucky to charge tolls for access.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kctcs.net/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-09-28#6693 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061008233115/http://www.kctcs.net/todaysnews/index.cfm?tn_date=2006-09-28#6693 |archive-date=October 8, 2006 |title=Fletcher:Tolls to end November 22 |access-date=May 1, 2007 |last=Stinnett |first=Chuck}}</ref> The related [[Toll house|toll booths]] have been demolished.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.courierpress.com/news/2006/nov/22/onlookers-cheer-booth-destruction-at-ceremony/| title = Onlookers Cheer Booth Destruction at Ceremony| access-date = August 10, 2007| last = Stinnett| first = Chuck| date = November 22, 2006| publisher = Courier Press| archive-date = September 1, 2007| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070901145219/http://www.courierpress.com/news/2006/nov/22/onlookers-cheer-booth-destruction-at-ceremony/| url-status = live}}</ref>

Ending the tolls some seven months ahead of schedule was generally agreed to have been a positive economic development for transportation in Kentucky.

===Water===

As the state is bounded by two of the largest rivers in North America, water transportation has historically played a major role in Kentucky's economy. Louisville was a major port for steamships in the nineteenth century. Today, most barge traffic on Kentucky waterways consists of coal that is shipped from both the Eastern and Western Coalfields, about half of which is used locally to power many power plants located directly off the [[Ohio River]], with the rest being exported to other countries, most notably Japan.

Many of the largest ports in the United States are located in or adjacent to Kentucky, including:
* [[Port of Huntington-Tristate|Huntington-Tristate]] (includes [[Ashland, Kentucky]]), largest [[inland port]] and 7th largest overall
* Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky, 5th largest inland port and 43rd overall
* Louisville-Southern Indiana, 7th largest inland port and 55th overall

As a state, Kentucky ranks 10th overall in port tonnage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/pdf/inlandport03f.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090825064009/http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/pdf/inlandport03f.pdf |archive-date=August 25, 2009 |title=Top 20 Inland U.S. Ports for 2003 |access-date=December 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/portton01.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100502153836/http://www.iwr.usace.army.mil/ndc/wcsc/portton01.htm |archive-date=May 2, 2010 |title=CY 2001 Tonnage for Selected U.S. Ports by Port Tons |date=May 2, 2010 |access-date=December 7, 2011}}</ref>

The only natural obstacle along the entire length of the Ohio River is the [[Falls of the Ohio]], located just west of [[Downtown Louisville]].

==Law and government==

{{Further|Government of Kentucky}}

Kentucky is one of four U.S. states to officially use the term ''[[Commonwealth (U.S. state)|commonwealth]].'' The term was used for Kentucky as it had also been used by Virginia, from which Kentucky was created. The term has no particular significance in its meaning and was chosen to emphasize the distinction from the status of royal colonies as a place governed for the general welfare of the populace.<ref>[http://www.uky.edu/KentuckyAtlas/kentucky.html The Commonwealth of Kentucky] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525150528/http://www.uky.edu/KentuckyAtlas/kentucky.html |date=May 25, 2012 }}, Kentucky Atlas & Gazetteer, [[University of Kentucky]] website.</ref> Kentucky was originally styled as the "State of Kentucky" in the act admitting it to the Union and its first constitution.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/1st-congress.php|title=Public Statutes at Large of the United States of America|author=United States Congress|website=Statutes at Large: 1st Congress|date=September 2014|page=189|access-date=June 4, 2017|archive-date=May 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170507145334/http://www.loc.gov/law/help/statutes-at-large/1st-congress.php|url-status=live}}</ref>

The "Commonwealth" term was used in citizen petitions submitted between 1786 and 1792 for the creation of the state.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kentucky|url=https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/kentucky|access-date=June 23, 2021|website=HISTORY|language=en|archive-date=June 20, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210620153533/https://www.history.com/topics/us-states/kentucky|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also used in the title of a history of the state that was published in 1834 and was used in various places within that book in references to Virginia and Kentucky.<ref>Butler, Mann, ''[https://archive.org/details/historyofcommonw00butl A History of the Commonwealth of Kentucky]'', Wilcox, Dickerman & Co., 1834.</ref> The other three states officially called "commonwealths" are [[Massachusetts]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]]; the territories of [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Northern Mariana Islands]] are also formally commonwealths.

Kentucky is one of only five states that elect their state officials in odd-numbered years (the others being [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[New Jersey]], and [[Virginia]]). Kentucky holds elections for these offices every four years in the years preceding Presidential election years. Thus, Kentucky held gubernatorial elections in 2015, 2019 and 2023.

===Executive branch===

[[File:KY Governors Mansion.png|thumb|upright=1.25|The governor's mansion in [[Frankfort, Kentucky|Frankfort]]]]

The executive branch is headed by the [[Governor of Kentucky|governor]], who serves as both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. The [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|lieutenant governor]] may or may not have executive authority depending on whether the person is a member of the Governor's [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]]. Under the current [[Kentucky Constitution]], the lieutenant governor assumes the duties of the governor only if the governor is incapacitated. (Before 1992 the lieutenant governor assumed power any time the governor was out of the state.) The governor and lieutenant governor usually run on a single ticket (also per a 1992 constitutional amendment) and are elected to four-year terms. The current governor is [[Andy Beshear]], and the lieutenant governor is [[Jacqueline Coleman]]. Both are [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://apnews.com/357f0e6196414923acee9ee7aebdf8b8|title=Beshear set for 'next chapter' as Bevin concedes in Kentucky|date=November 14, 2019|website=AP NEWS|access-date=November 19, 2019|archive-date=November 17, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117002146/https://apnews.com/357f0e6196414923acee9ee7aebdf8b8|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/matt-bevin-concedes-defeat-in-kentucky-governors-race/2019/11/14/42fc0ea7-2d26-4f87-9856-07f6c701ad7b_video.html|title=Matt Bevin concedes defeat in Kentucky governor's race|newspaper=The Washington Post|access-date=November 19, 2019|archive-date=November 15, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115232142/https://www.washingtonpost.com/video/politics/matt-bevin-concedes-defeat-in-kentucky-governors-race/2019/11/14/42fc0ea7-2d26-4f87-9856-07f6c701ad7b_video.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

The executive branch is organized into the following "cabinets", each headed by a secretary who is also a member of the governor's cabinet:<ref>{{cite web|title=Organizational Charts|work=Kentucky Personnel|publisher=Kentucky Personnel Cabinet|access-date=December 23, 2020|url=https://personnel.ky.gov/Pages/OrgCharts.aspx|archive-date=January 1, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210101151723/https://personnel.ky.gov/Pages/OrgCharts.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The cabinet system was introduced in 1972 by Governor [[Wendell Ford]] to consolidate hundreds of government entities that reported directly to the governor's office.<ref>{{cite book|title=Kentucky Government, Politics, and Public Policy|editor1-first=James C.|editor1-last=Clinger|editor2-first=Michael W.|editor2-last=Hail|location=Lexington, Kentucky|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|date=October 8, 2013|page=70|isbn=978-0-8131-4315-6|quote=By 1972 Governor Wendell Ford found himself in a situation similar to that of Governor [[Happy Chandler|Chandler]] thirty-six years earlier. At this time the executive branch had grown to over 60 departments and agencies and 210 boards and commissions falling under the jurisdiction of the governor. Governor Ford issued a reorganization report creating six cabinet departments and a framework for an executive branch that would be more manageable and accountable. As of 2012, this has grown to eleven cabinet departments with three additional cabinet-rank members under the office of Governor [[Steve Beshear|Beshear]]. Each cabinet agency is headed by a secretary who serves at the will of the governor.}}</ref>

Other elected constitutional offices include the [[Secretary of State of Kentucky|Secretary of State]], [[Attorney General of Kentucky|Attorney General]], Auditor of Public Accounts, [[Kentucky State Treasurer|State Treasurer]] and Commissioner of Agriculture. Currently, Republican [[Michael Adams (Kentucky politician)|Michael G. Adams]] serves as the Secretary of State.

The Auditor of Public Accounts is Republican [[Allison Ball]]. Republican [[Mark Metcalf (politician)|Mark Metcalf]] is the current Treasurer. Republican [[Jonathan Shell]] is the current [[Kentucky Commissioner of Agriculture|Commissioner of Agriculture]].

===Legislative branch===
[[File:Kentucky_State_Capitol_Building.jpg|thumb|The Kentucky State Capitol Building]]
Kentucky's legislative branch consists of a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] body known as the [[Kentucky General Assembly]]. The [[Kentucky Senate|Senate]] is considered the [[upper house]]. It has 38 members and is led by the [[President of the Senate]], currently [[Robert Stivers]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]).

The judicial branch of Kentucky is called the Kentucky Court of Justice<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courts.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx|title=Kentucky Court of Justice – Home|access-date=January 21, 2017|archive-date=November 7, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107014242/https://courts.ky.gov/Pages/default.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> and comprises courts of [[limited jurisdiction]] called District Courts; courts of general jurisdiction called [[Kentucky Circuit Courts|Circuit Courts]]; specialty courts such as Drug Court<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courts.ky.gov/courtprograms/drugcourt/Pages/default.aspx|title=Adult Drug Court – Kentucky Drug Court: Saving Costs, Saving Lives|access-date=January 21, 2017|archive-date=January 19, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119181832/http://courts.ky.gov/courtprograms/drugcourt/Pages/default.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref> and Family Court;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://courts.ky.gov/courts/familycourt/Pages/default.aspx|title=Family Court|access-date=January 21, 2017|archive-date=January 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170121174533/http://courts.ky.gov/courts/familycourt/Pages/default.aspx|url-status=dead}}</ref> an intermediate appellate court, the [[Kentucky Court of Appeals]]; and a court of last resort, the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]].

The Kentucky Court of Justice is headed by the [[Chief Justice]] of the Commonwealth. The chief justice is appointed by, and is an elected member of, the Supreme Court of Kentucky. The current chief justice is [[Laurance B. VanMeter|Laurance VanMeter]].

Unlike federal judges, who are usually appointed, justices serving on Kentucky state courts are chosen by the state's populace in non-partisan elections.

===Federal representation===

[[File:KY-districts-108.JPG|thumb|A map showing Kentucky's six [[Kentucky Congressional Districts|congressional districts]]]]

Kentucky's two [[United States Senate|U.S. senators]] are Senate Minority Leader [[Mitch McConnell]] and [[Rand Paul]], both Republicans. The state is divided into six [[Kentucky's congressional districts|congressional districts]], represented by Republicans [[James Comer (politician)|James Comer]] ([[Kentucky's 1st congressional district|1st]]), [[Brett Guthrie]] ([[Kentucky's 2nd congressional district|2nd]]), [[Thomas Massie]] ([[Kentucky's 4th congressional district|4th]]), [[Hal Rogers]] ([[Kentucky's 5th congressional district|5th]]) and [[Andy Barr (American politician)|Andy Barr]] ([[Kentucky's 6th congressional district|6th]]) and Democrat [[Morgan McGarvey]] ([[Kentucky's 3rd congressional district|3rd]]).

Appeals are heard in the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]], based in [[Cincinnati]], Ohio.

===Law===

[[File:Kentucky schild.jpg|thumb|State sign, [[Interstate 65]]]]

Kentucky's body of laws, known as the [[Kentucky Revised Statutes]] (KRS), were enacted in 1942 to better organize and clarify the whole of Kentucky law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statrev/revoff.htm |title=Reviser of Statutes Office – History and Functions |publisher=Kentucky Legislative Research Commission |access-date=December 27, 2006 |archive-date=February 6, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206205857/http://www.lrc.ky.gov/statrev/revoff.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref> The statutes are enforced by local [[police]], [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriffs]] and deputy sheriffs, and [[constable]]s and deputy constables.

[[File:United States presidential election in Kentucky, 2016.svg|thumb|right|upright=1.3|[[Treemap]] of the popular vote by county, 2016 presidential election]]

Since the late 1990s, Kentucky has supported [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidates for most federal political offices, and, more recently, for state-level office as well. The state leaned toward the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] from 1860 through the 1990s, and was considered a [[swing state]] at the presidential level for most of the latter half of the 20th century.

The southeastern region of the state aligned with the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the war and has consistently supported Republican candidates. The central and western portions of the state were heavily Democratic in the years leading to the Civil War, were pro-secessionist and pro-Confederate during the Civil War, and in the decades following the war. Kentucky was part of the Democratic [[Solid South]] in the second half of the nineteenth century and through the majority of the twentieth century.

Mirroring a broader national reversal of party composition, the Kentucky Democratic Party of the twenty-first century primarily consists of liberal whites, African Americans, and other minorities. Although most of the state's voters have reliably elected Republican candidates for federal office since the late 1990s, Democrats held an advantage in party registration until 2022. On July 15, 2022, the [[Secretary of State of Kentucky|Kentucky Secretary of State]]'s office announced that for the first time in its history, the commonwealth had more registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] than registered Democrats, with 45.19% of the state's voters registered as Republicans, 45.12% registered as Democrats, and 9.69% registered with [[Third party (United States)|another political party]] or as independents.<ref name="kypartyreg">{{cite web|url=https://elect.ky.gov/Resources/Documents/voterstatscounty-20220115-075312.pdf|title=Election Statistics Registration Statistics|website=elect.ky.gov|access-date=January 19, 2022|archive-date=January 19, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220119190209/https://elect.ky.gov/Resources/Documents/voterstatscounty-20220115-075312.pdf|url-status=live}}</ref>

From 1964 through 2004, Kentucky voted for the eventual winner of the election for President of the United States; however, in the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]] the state lost its [[bellwether]] status. Republican [[John McCain]] won Kentucky, but he lost the national popular and electoral vote to Democrat [[Barack Obama]] (McCain carried Kentucky 57% to 41%). 116 of Kentucky's 120 counties supported former [[Massachusetts]] Governor [[Mitt Romney]] in the 2012 election while he lost to Barack Obama nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/president/kentucky/|title=2012 Kentucky Presidential Results|website=POLITICO|access-date=June 25, 2016|archive-date=June 23, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623182920/http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/president/kentucky/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/map/#/President/2012/|title=2012 Election Results Map by State – Live Voting Updates|last=POLITICO|website=POLITICO|access-date=June 25, 2016|archive-date=June 27, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160627220942/http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/map/#/President/2012/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Voters in the Commonwealth have supported the previous three Democratic candidates elected to the White House in the late 20th century, all from Southern states: [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] ([[Texas]]) in 1964, [[Jimmy Carter]] ([[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]) in 1976, and [[Bill Clinton]] ([[Arkansas]]) in 1992 and 1996. In the twenty-first century presidential elections, the state has become a Republican stronghold, supporting that party's presidential candidates by double-digit margins from 2000 through 2020. At the same time, voters have continued to elect Democratic candidates to state and local offices in many jurisdictions.

[[Elliott County, Kentucky]] is notable for having held the longest streak of any county in the United States voting Democratic. Founded in 1869, Elliott County supported the Democratic nominee in every presidential election from [[1872 United States presidential election in Kentucky|1872]] (the first in which it participated) until [[2012 United States presidential election in Kentucky|2012]]. In [[2016 United States presidential election in Kentucky|2016]], [[Donald Trump]] became the first Republican to ever carry the county, and he did so in a 44-point landslide, highlighting the modern Republican Party's dominance among rural whites and many ancestrally Democratic, socially-conservative voters.

Kentucky is one of the most [[anti-abortion]] states in the United States. A 2014 poll conducted by [[Pew Research Center]] found that 57% of Kentucky's population thought that [[abortion]] should be illegal in all/most cases, while only 36% thought that abortion should be legal in all/most cases.<ref>{{cite web|title=Religion in America: U.S. Religious Data, Demographics and Statistics|url=https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/views-about-abortion/by/state/|access-date=April 17, 2021|website=Pew Research Center's Religion & Public Life Project|archive-date=April 11, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210411213946/https://www.pewforum.org/religious-landscape-study/compare/views-about-abortion/by/state/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Kentucky culture is firmly [[Southern culture|Southern]], and influenced by that of [[Appalachia]]. The state is known for [[Bourbon whiskey|bourbon]] and [[whiskey]] distilling, [[tobacco]], [[horse racing]], and [[college basketball]]. Kentucky is more similar to the [[Upland South]] in terms of ancestry that is predominantly American.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040920132346/http://www.census.gov/prod/2004pubs/c2kbr-35.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=September 20, 2004 |title=Ancestry 2000: Census 2000 Brief |author1=Brittingham, Angela |author2=de la Cruz, G.

Nevertheless, during the 19th century, Kentucky did receive a substantial number of German immigrants, who settled mostly in the Midwest and parts of the Upper South, along the Ohio River primarily in Louisville, Covington and Newport.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kygermanscw.yolasite.com/the-story.php |title=Kentucky's German Americans in the Civil War |publisher=Kygermanscw.yolasite.com |access-date=July 2, 2010 |archive-date=June 3, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110603023147/http://kygermanscw.yolasite.com/the-story.php |url-status=live }}</ref> Only Maryland, Delaware and West Virginia have higher German ancestry percentages than Kentucky among Census-defined Southern states, although Kentucky's percentage is closer to Arkansas and Virginia's than the previously named state's percentages.

Kentucky was a [[slave state]], and Black people once composed over one-quarter of its population; however, it lacked the [[cotton]] plantation system though it did support significant and large scale tobacco [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] systems in the western and central parts of the state more similar to the plantations developed in Virginia and North Carolina than those in the Deep South, and never had the same high percentage of African Americans as most other slave states. While less than 8% of the total population is Black, Kentucky has a relatively significant rural African American population in the Central and Western areas of the state.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://srdc.msstate.edu/poverty/ppts/cromartie.ppt| title = High Poverty in the Rural U.S. and South: Progress and Persistence in the 1990s| access-date=June 28, 2007| author = Beale, Calvin| date = July 21, 2004| format = PowerPoint| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626232430/http://srdc.msstate.edu/poverty/ppts/cromartie.ppt| archive-date = June 26, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://srdc.msstate.edu/poverty/ppts/womack.ppt |title=The American Black Belt Region: A Forgotten Place |access-date=June 28, 2007 |author=Womack, Veronica L. |date=July 23, 2004 |format=PowerPoint |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626232429/http://srdc.msstate.edu/poverty/ppts/womack.ppt |archive-date=June 26, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.bowdoin.edu/~prael/branch/ex1/m4-black-belt.jpg| title = Identifying the "Black Belt" of Cash-Crop Production| access-date = June 28, 2007| author = Unknown| format = JPEG Image| publisher = Bowdoin College| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070628062351/http://www.bowdoin.edu/~prael/branch/ex1/m4-black-belt.jpg| archive-date = June 28, 2007| url-status = dead}}</ref>

Kentucky adopted the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system of [[racial segregation]] in most public spheres after the Civil War. Louisville's 1914 ordinance for residential racial segregation was [[Buchanan v. Warley|struck down by the Supreme Court in 1917]]. However, in 1908 Kentucky enacted the [[Day Law]], "An Act to Prohibit White and Colored Persons from Attending the Same School", which Berea College [[Berea College v. Kentucky|unsuccessfully challenged at the US Supreme Court in 1908]]. In 1948, [[Lyman T. Johnson]] filed suit for admission to the [[University of Kentucky]]; as a result, nearly thirty African American students entered UK graduate and professional programs in the summer of 1949.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://explorekyhistory.ky.gov/items/show/145|title=Desegregation of UK – ExploreKYHistory|website=ExploreKYHistory|access-date=July 9, 2017|archive-date=August 30, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170830195253/http://explorekyhistory.ky.gov/items/show/145|url-status=live}}</ref> Kentucky integrated its schools after the 1954 ''[[Brown v.

[[Renfro Valley, Kentucky]] is home to Renfro Valley Entertainment Center and the Kentucky Music Hall of Fame and is known as "Kentucky's Country Music Capital", a designation given it by the Kentucky State Legislature in the late 1980s. The Renfro Valley Barn Dance was where Renfro Valley's musical heritage began, in 1939, and influential country music luminaries like [[Red Foley]], [[Homer &&nbsp;Jethro]], [[Lily May Ledford]] &{{spaces}}the Original [[Coon Creek Girls]], Martha Carson and many others have performed as regular members of the shows there over the years. The [[Renfro Valley Gatherin']] is today America's second-oldest continually broadcast radio program of any kind.

===Literature===

{{Main|Kentucky literature}}

Kentucky has played a major role in Southern and American literature, producing works that often celebrate the working class, rural life, nature, and explore issues of class, extractive economy, and family. Major works from the state include ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852) by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]], widely seen as one of the impetuses for the American Civil War; ''The Little Shepherd of Kingdom Come'' (1908) by [[John Fox Jr.]], which was the first novel to sell a million copies in the United States; ''[[All the King's Men]]'' by [[Robert Penn Warren]] (1946), rated as the 36th best [[Modern Library 100 Best Novels|English-language novel of the 20th century]]; ''The Dollmaker'' (1954) by [[Harriette Simpson Arnow|Harriette Arnow]]; ''[[Night Comes to the Cumberlands]]'' (1962) by [[Harry Caudill]], which contributed to initiating the U.S. Government's [[War on poverty]], and others.

Author [[Thomas Merton]] lived most of his life and wrote most of his books{{snd}}including ''[[The Seven Storey Mountain]]'' (1948), ranked on ''[[National Review]]''{{'s}} list of the 100 best non-fiction books of the century{{snd}}during his time as a monk at the [[Abbey of Our Lady of Gethsemani]] near Bardstown, Kentucky. Author [[Hunter S. Thompson]] is also a native of the state. Since the later part of the 20th century, several writers from Kentucky have published widely read and critically acclaimed books, including: [[Wendell Berry]] ([[Floruit|fl.]] 1960–), [[Silas House]] (fl. 2001–), [[Barbara Kingsolver]] (fl. 1988–), poet [[Maurice Manning (poet)|Maurice Manning]] (fl. 2001–), and [[Bobbie Ann Mason]] (fl. 1988–).

Well-known playwrights from Kentucky include [[Marsha Norman]] (works include ''[['night, Mother]]'', 1983), [[Naomi Wallace]] (works include ''[[One Flea Spare]]'', 1995), and [[George C. Wolfe]] (works include ''[[Jelly's Last Jam]]'', 1992).

===Cuisine===

{{Main|Cuisine of Kentucky}}

Kentucky's cuisine is generally similar to and is a part of traditional southern cooking, although in some areas of the state it can blend elements of both the South and Appalachia, mixing Appalachian with the native Southern cuisine of the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iicaculinary.com/iica-ye2-sem1.htm#ac303 |title=International Institute of Culinary Arts |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106091226/http://www.iicaculinary.com/iica-curr.htm#ac303 |archive-date=January 6, 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref> One original Kentucky dish is called the [[Hot Brown]], a dish normally layered in this order: toasted bread, turkey, bacon, tomatoes and topped with [[mornay sauce]].

Kentucky is the home of sports teams such as [[Minor League Baseball]]'s Triple-A [[Louisville Bats]] and High-A [[Bowling Green Hot Rods]]. It is home to the independent [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]]'s [[Lexington Legends]] and the [[Frontier League]]'s [[Florence Y'alls]]. The [[Lexington Horsemen]] and [[Louisville Fire]] of the now-defunct [[af2]] had been interested in making a move up to the "major league" [[Arena Football League]], but nothing has come of those plans.

The [[Northern Kentucky|northern part of the state]] lies across the [[Ohio River]] from Cincinnati, which is home to the [[National Football League]]'s [[Cincinnati Bengals]], [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[Cincinnati Reds]]. It is not uncommon for fans to park in the city of [[Newport, Kentucky|Newport]] and use the [[Newport Southbank Bridge|Newport Southbank Pedestrian Bridge]], locally known as the "Purple People Bridge", to walk to these games in Cincinnati. [[Georgetown College (Kentucky)|Georgetown College]] in [[Georgetown, Kentucky|Georgetown]] was the location for the Bengals' summer training camp, until it was announced in 2012 that the Bengals would no longer use the facilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bengalscamp.com |title=About the camp |publisher=Georgetown College |access-date=December 18, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205035939/http://bengalscamp.com/ |archive-date=December 5, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

As in many states, especially those without major league professional sports teams, college athletics are prominent. This is especially true of the state's three Division{{spaces}}I [[Football Bowl Subdivision]] (FBS) programs, including the [[Kentucky Wildcats]], the [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers and Lady Toppers|Western Kentucky Hilltoppers]], and the [[Louisville Cardinals]]. The [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Wildcats]], [[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers basketball|Hilltoppers]], and [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Cardinals]] are among the most tradition-rich college men's basketball teams in the United States, combining for 11 National Championships and 24 NCAA Final Fours;{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} all three are high on the lists of total all-time wins, wins per season, and average wins per season.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

[[Western Kentucky Hilltoppers football|Western Kentucky]], the 2002 [[NCAA Division I Football Championship|national champion in Division{{spaces}}I-AA football]] (now [[Football Championship Subdivision]] (FCS)), completed its transition to Division{{spaces}}I FBS football in 2009.

The [[Kentucky Derby]] is a horse race held annually in Louisville on the first Saturday in May. The [[Valhalla Golf Club]] in Louisville has hosted several editions of the [[PGA Championship]], [[Senior PGA Championship]] and [[Ryder Cup]] since the 1990s.

The [[NASCAR Cup Series]] held a race at the [[Kentucky Speedway]] in [[Sparta, Kentucky]] from 2011 to 2020. The NASCAR [[Nationwide Series]] and the [[Camping World Truck Series]] raced there through 2020. The [[IndyCar Series]] previously raced there as well.

[[Ohio Valley Wrestling]] in Louisville was the primary location for training and rehab for [[WWE]] professional wrestlers from 2000 until 2008, when WWE moved its contracted talent to Florida Championship Wrestling. OVW later became the primary developmental territory for [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling]] (TNA) from 2011 to 2013.

In 2014 [[Louisville City FC]], a professional soccer team in the league then known as USL Pro and now as the [[United Soccer League]], was announced. The team made its debut in 2015, playing home games at Louisville Slugger Field. In its first season, Louisville City was the official reserve side for [[Orlando City SC]], who made its debut in [[Major League Soccer]] at the same time. That arrangement ended in 2016 when Orlando City established a [[Orlando City B|directly controlled reserve side]] in the USL.

===Kentucky colonel===

{{Main|Kentucky colonel}}

The distinction of being named a '''Kentucky colonel''' is the highest [[title of honor]] bestowed by the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Commissions for Kentucky colonels are given by the [[Governor of Kentucky|Governor]] and the [[Secretary of State of Kentucky|Secretary of State]] to individuals in recognition of noteworthy accomplishments and outstanding service to a community, state or the nation. The sitting [[Governor of Kentucky|governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky]] bestows the honor of a colonel's [[commission (document)|commission]], by issuance of [[letters patent]].
