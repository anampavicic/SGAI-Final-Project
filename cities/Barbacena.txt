'''Barbacena''' is a [[List of municipalities in Minas Gerais|municipality]] in the [[States of Brazil|state]] of [[Minas Gerais]], [[Brazil]]. As of 2020, the municipality had 138,204 inhabitants.  The total area of the municipality is {{convert|788|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on|sp=us}}.

Barbacena is known for its strong Italian influence. The Rodrigo Silva Colonial Nucleus was established in the late 19th century, and the immigration process lasted until the early 20th century. Most of the immigrants came from the [[Veneto]] region. Currently, Rodrigo Silva colonial nucleus  is part of the territory of the city of [[Antônio Carlos, Minas Gerais|Antônio Carlos]] (separated from Barbacena in 1948) and of the homonymous neighborhood "Colônia".<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-08-31 |title=Imigração italiana em Antônio Carlos e Barbacena: o caso da Colônia Rodrigo Silva |url=https://casaditaliajf.com.br/2021/08/31/revista-casaditalia-imigracao-italiana-em-antonio-carlos-e-barbacena-o-caso-da-colonia-rodrigo-silva/ |access-date=2023-04-21 |website=Casa D'Italia - Juiz de Fora |language=pt-BR}}</ref>

It is in the foothills of the [[Serra da Mantiqueira]] south of the state capital [[Belo Horizonte]] at an elevation of {{convert|1,136|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}}, making it one of the ten highest cities in Brazil. Located on the important BR-040 highway (also called Rodovia JK), which links [[Brasília]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]], it is {{convert|165|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} from the state capital and {{convert|97|km|mi|abbr=on|sp=us}} from [[Juiz de Fora]].

Barbacena has a humid tropical climate with cool summers due to the elevation.  Summer averages are {{convert|24|C|F|abbr=on|sp=us}} and winter averages {{convert|13|C|F|abbr=on|sp=us}}.  The cool climate and abundant rainfall have made Barbacena a center for flower production — the city is the biggest producer of flowers in Minas Gerais, and is nicknamed "City of Roses". Cattle raising and the dairy industry are quite developed and the city is a big producer of milk products; there are also several small textile factories.

Barbacena is also the home of the [[Preparatory School of Air Cadets]] (the sixteenth best [[high school]] of the country,<ref>{{cite web |author=UOL Educação |title=Ranking das 20 melhores escolas do Brasil do Enem 2008 |url=http://educacao.uol.com.br/ultnot/2009/04/28/ult1811u274.jhtm |language=pt |year=2008 |access-date= 2009-10-06}}</ref> which belongs to the [[Brazilian Air Force]]) and of a Medical School, Faculdade de Medicina de Barbacena (Faculty of Medicine of Barbacena). The city is also famous for the [[Hospital Colônia de Barbacena]], a mental hospital founded in 1903, which was known for its abusive treatment of patients.<ref name="Daniela Arbex 2011">{{cite web|author=Daniela Arbex |title=Holocausto Brasileiro: 50 anos sem punição (Brazilian Holocaust: 50 years without punishment) |url=http://www.tribunademinas.com.br/cidade/holocausto-brasileiro-50-anos-sem-punic-o-1.989343 |language=pt |year=2011 |access-date=2013-11-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110161848/http://www.tribunademinas.com.br/cidade/holocausto-brasileiro-50-anos-sem-punic-o-1.989343 |archive-date=10 November 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> According to sources, 70% of the patients did not have mental illness,<ref name="Daniela Arbex 2011"/> and allegedly 60,000 people died in the hospital.<ref name="Daniela Arbex 2011"/> It ceased operations in the mid-1980s. It has been compared to a [[Nazi concentration camp]].<ref name="Daniela Arbex 2011"/>

Barbacena was the birthplace of the [[human rights]] activist and lawyer [[Heráclito Fontoura Sobral Pinto]]. Barbacena is also known for being the hometown of student [[Isabel Cristina Mrad Campos]], [[beatification|beatified]] in December 2022 by the [[Catholic Church]].<ref name=VA>{{cite web|url=https://www.vaticannews.va/en/church/news/2022-12/pope-praises-heroic-example-blessed-isabel-cristina-mrad-campos.html|title=Pope praises heroic example of Blessed Isabel Cristina Mrad Campos|publisher=Vatican News|date=11 December 2022|accessdate=27 March 2023}}</ref>
