The capital is the city of [[Basra]], located in the [[Basrah District|Basrah district]]. Other districts of Basra include [[Al-Qurna District|Al-Qurna]], [[Al-Zubair District|Al-Zubair]], [[Al-Midaina District|Al-Midaina]], [[Shatt Al-Arab District|Shatt Al-Arab]], [[Abu Al-Khaseeb District|Abu Al-Khaseeb]] and [[Al-Faw District, Basra Governorate|Al-Faw]] located on the [[Persian Gulf]]. It is the only governorate with a coastline.

==History==
[[Image:Basra Province 1897.png|thumb|250px|Basra (Bassorah) Vilayet in 1897]]
In 1920, after the defeat of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in [[World War I]], the [[United Kingdom]] took over the former [[Subdivisions of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman vilayets]] of [[Basra Vilayet (Ottoman Empire)|Basra]], [[Baghdad Province, Ottoman Empire|Baghdad]] and [[Mosul Province, Ottoman Empire|Mosul]] which had together formed the historical region of ''Irak Arabi'' or ''[[Babylonia|Irak Babeli]]'', and called it the [[Mandate for Mesopotamia|British Mandate of Mesopotamia]]. The [[League of Nations mandate|mandate]] was succeeded by the [[Kingdom of Iraq]] in 1932.<ref name="Sassoon2011">{{cite book|last=Sassoon|first=Joseph|title=Saddam Hussein's Ba'th Party: Inside an Authoritarian Regime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kb82Pw-1_r0C&pg=PA17|date=12 December 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-50392-1|page=17}}</ref>

The Shiite population suffered long and hard under Saddam's rule. The city of Basra had suffered considerably during the eight-year war with Iran and Allied bombardment and in 1991 during the [[Gulf War]], the governorate ventured into an [[1991 uprising in Basra|uprising]] after the United States promised them aid. It was started in Basra by angry soldiers, according to popular legend after they fired at a giant public portrait of Saddam Hussein.<ref name="Goldstein">{{cite book|last=Goldstein|first=Eric|title=Endless Torment: The 1991 Uprising in Iraq and Its Aftermath|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zWVRzLncwIoC&pg=PA45|date=1 January 1992|publisher=Human Rights Watch|isbn=978-1-56432-069-8|page=45}}</ref> Mass support on the streets followed, shouting slogans, executing [[Ba'ath]] party members, leaders and secret police, and destroying pictures and monuments of [[Saddam Hussein]]. The participants had expected support from American troops. but the Allied army at the time was occupied despite the 24th Infantry Division stationed only several miles from the city. The city of Basra did not completely succumb to the rebels; a counterattack by some 6,000 loyalists from the Republican Guard held out against 5,000 defectors of the Iraqi army.<ref name="Goldstein"/> After about three days, the Republican Guard began to gain control, destroying "everything in front of them", killing many of the rebels in the streets and conducting mass executions on the public squares.<ref name="Goldstein"/>

From 2003 the governorate was one of the centres of warfare during the invasion of the British and Americans during the [[Iraq War]]. The [[Battle of Basra (2003)|Battle of Basra]] took place between March 23 and April 7 between the British 1st Armoured Division forces under Major General [[Robin Brims]], and Iraqi forces under General [[Ali Hassan al-Majid]] (Chemical Ali).<ref name="Mockaitis2013">{{cite book|last=Mockaitis|first=Thomas R.|title=The Iraq War Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2baNAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA50|date=15 August 2013|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-0-313-38063-1|page=50}}</ref> Much of the heaviest combat in the war took place in the province in subsequent weeks. Several outbreaks of violence between secular Iraqis and Shiite Muslims broke out in summer 2006, and in September 2007, British troops were withdrawn to Basra Airport, and withdrew entirely from the city in December 2007.<ref name="Mockaitis2013"/> Following the example of the [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdistan Autonomous Region]] in northern Iraq, Basra has proposed uniting with the other provinces of [[Dhi Qar Governorate|Dhi Qar]] and [[Maysan Governorate|Maysan]] as an autonomous region. On October 15, 2005, 691,024 people, some 96.02%, voted for the new constitution. 

During the Gulf War, part of Kuwait became a part of the Basra Governorate and was given the name, [[Saddamiyat al-Mitla' District]].
