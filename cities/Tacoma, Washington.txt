'''Tacoma''' ({{IPAc-en|t|ə|ˈ|k|oʊ|m|ə}} {{respell|tə|KOH|mə}}) is the [[county seat]] of [[Pierce County, Washington|Pierce County]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States.<ref name="GR6">{{cite web |url=http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |access-date=June 7, 2011 |title=Find a County |publisher=National Association of Counties |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210815/http://www.naco.org/Counties/Pages/FindACounty.aspx |archive-date=May 31, 2011}}</ref> A port city, it is situated along Washington's [[Puget Sound]], {{convert|32|mi|km}} southwest of [[Seattle]], {{convert|36|mi|km}} southwest of [[Bellevue, Washington|Bellevue]], {{convert|31|mi|km}} northeast of the state capital, [[Olympia, Washington|Olympia]], {{convert|58|mi|km}} northwest of [[Mount Rainier National Park]], and {{convert|80|mi|km}} east of [[Olympic National Park]]. The city's population was 219,346 at the time of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]].<ref name="2020 Census (City)">{{cite web |title=Explore Census Data |url=https://data.census.gov/profile/Tacoma_city,_Washington?g=160XX00US5370000 |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=January 5, 2023}}</ref> Tacoma is the second-largest city in the Puget Sound area and the [[List of municipalities in Washington|third-most populous]] in the state. Tacoma also serves as the center of business activity for the [[South Puget Sound|South Sound]] region, which has a population of about 1 million.

Tacoma adopted its name after the nearby [[Mount Rainier]], called [[wikt:Tacoma|təˡqʷuʔbəʔ]] in the [[Lushootseed|Puget Sound Salish]] dialect, and “Takhoma” in an anglicized version. It is locally known as the "City of Destiny" because the area was chosen to be the western terminus of the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] in the late 19th century. The decision of the railroad was influenced by Tacoma's neighboring deep-water harbor, [[Commencement Bay]]. By connecting the bay with the railroad, Tacoma's motto became "When rails meet sails". Commencement Bay serves the [[Port of Tacoma]], a center of [[international trade]] on the [[Pacific Coast]] and Washington's largest port. The city gained notoriety in 1940 for the collapse of the [[Tacoma Narrows Bridge (1940)|Tacoma Narrows Bridge]], which earned the nickname "Galloping Gertie" due to the vertical movement of the deck during windy conditions.

Like most industrial cities, Tacoma suffered a prolonged decline in the mid-20th century as a result of [[suburbanization]] and divestment. Since the 1990s, downtown Tacoma has experienced a period of revitalization. Developments in the downtown include the [[University of Washington Tacoma]]; the [[T Line (Sound Transit)|T Line]] (formerly Tacoma Link), the first modern electric [[light rail]] service in the state; the state's highest density of art and history museums; and a restored urban waterfront, the [[Thea Foss Waterway]].

==History==

===Early history===
[[Image:Mount Rainier overlooking the Port of Tacoma.jpg|thumb|View of Mount Rainier and the Port of Tacoma from [[Browns Point]], 2009]]
The area was inhabited for thousands of years by [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indians]], most recently the [[Puyallup (tribe)|Puyallup]] people, who lived in settlements on the delta.

In 1852, a Swede named Nicolas Delin built a water-powered sawmill on a creek near the head of Commencement Bay, but the small settlement that grew around it was abandoned during the [[Puget Sound War|Indian War of 1855–56]]. In 1864, pioneer and postmaster [[Job Carr]], a Civil War veteran and land speculator, built a cabin (which also served as Tacoma's first post office; a replica was built in 2000 near the original site in "Old Town").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jobcarrmuseum.org/ |title=Job Carr Cabin Museum |website=Job Carr Cabin Museum}}</ref> Carr hoped to profit from the selection of Commencement Bay as the terminus of the Transcontinental Railroad, and sold most of his claim to developer [[Morton M. McCarver]] (1807–1875), who named his project Tacoma City, derived from the indigenous name for the mountain.

Tacoma was incorporated on November 12, 1875, following its selection in 1873 as the western terminus of the [[Northern Pacific Railroad]] due to lobbying by McCarver, future mayor [[John Wilson Sprague]], and others. However, the railroad built its depot in '''New Tacoma''', two miles (3&nbsp;km) south of the Carr–McCarver development. The two communities grew together and joined, merging on January 7, 1884. The transcontinental link was effected in 1887, and the population grew from 1,098 in 1880 to 36,006 in 1890. [[Rudyard Kipling]] visited Tacoma in 1889 and said it was "literally staggering under a boom of the boomiest".<ref>{{cite book |first=Caroline Denyer |last=Gallacci |title=The City of Destiny and the South Sound: An Illustrated History of Tacoma and Pierce County |location=Carlsbad, California |publisher=Heritage Media Corp |year=2001 |pages=49}}</ref>

[[File:Commencement Bay Land Improvement Co. business card.jpg|thumb|left|The Commencement Bay Land and Improvement Co. played a major role in the city's early growth.]]
[[George Francis Train]] was a resident for a few years in the late 19th century. In 1890, he staged a global circumnavigation starting and ending in Tacoma to promote the city. A plaque in downtown Tacoma marks the start and finish line.

In November 1885, white citizens led by then-mayor Jacob Weisbach [[Tacoma riot of 1885|expelled several hundred Chinese residents]] peacefully living in the city. As described by the account prepared by the Chinese Reconciliation Project Foundation, on the morning of November 3, "several hundred men, led by the mayor and other city officials, evicted the Chinese from their homes, corralled them at 7th Street and Pacific Avenue, marched them to the railway station at Lakeview and forced them aboard the morning train to [[Portland, Oregon]]. The next day two Chinese settlements were burned to the ground."

The discovery of gold in the [[Klondike Gold Rush|Klondike]] in 1898 led to Tacoma's prominence in the region being eclipsed by the development of Seattle.

A major tragedy marred the end of the 19th century, when a [[Tacoma streetcar disaster|streetcar accident]] resulted in significant loss of life on July 4, 1900.

===Early 20th century===

[[File:Asarco Tacoma 1909 postcard.jpg|thumb|left|A 1909 postcard image of Tacoma with its ASARCO smelter smokestack]]

From May to August 1907, the city was the site of a smelter workers' strike organized by Local 545 of the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), with the goal of a fifty-cent per day pay raise.<ref name="IWWYearbook1907">{{cite web |url=http://depts.washington.edu/iww/iwwyearbook1907.shtml |title=IWW Yearbook 1907 |last=Hermida |first=Arianne |website=IWW History Project |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |access-date=May 5, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601110035/http://depts.washington.edu/iww/iwwyearbook1907.shtml |archive-date=June 1, 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="IUB V1 N20">{{cite news |author=<!-- No author listed. --> |date=July 13, 1907 |title=To Whom It May Concern |volume=1 |issue=20 |page=2 |newspaper=[[Industrial Union Bulletin]] |url=https://archive.org/details/v1n20-jul-13-1907-iub}}</ref> The strike was strongly opposed by the local business community, and the smelter owners threatened to [[Blacklist (employment)|blacklist]] organizers and union officials.

Tacoma was briefly (1915–1922) a major destination for big-time automobile racing, with one of the nation's [[Tacoma Speedway|top-rated racing venues]] just outside the city limits, at the site of today's [[Clover Park Technical College]].

In 1924, Tacoma's first movie studio, H. C. Weaver Studio, was sited at present-day [[Titlow Beach]]. At the time, it was the third-largest freestanding film production space in America, with the two larger facilities being located in Hollywood.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/companies/H/hcWeaverProdInc.html |title=Silent Era : Progressive Silent Film List |website=www.silentera.com}}</ref> The production studio was also the first of its kind in the Pacific Northwest<ref name="stover">{{cite book |last1=Stover |first1=Karla |title=Hidden History of Tacoma: Little-Known Tales from the City of Destiny |date=2012 |publisher=The History Press |location=Charleston, SC |isbn=978-1-60949-470-4 |pages=125}}</ref> The first film produced in Tacoma was ''Hearts and Fists'', which starred [[John Bowers (actor)|John Bowers]] and premiered at Tacoma's [[Rialto Theater (Tacoma, Washington)|Rialto Theater]]. The studio's importance has undergone a revival with the discovery of one of its most famous lost films, ''[[Eyes of the Totem]]''.
{{wide image|Asahel Curtis panorama of Tacoma manufacturing district and tide flats, 1912 (cropped to rectangle).jpeg|1000px|Tacoma manufacturing district and tide flats, 1912.}} In 1932, the studios burned to the ground in a mysterious fire, and the production facility was never rebuilt. Several films were destroyed in the fire as old nitrate-based film did not survive.<ref name="stover"/>

===The Great Depression===
The 1929 crash of the stock market, resulting in the [[Great Depression]], was only the first event in a series of misfortunes to hit Tacoma in the winter of 1929–30. In one of the coldest winters on record, Tacoma experienced mass power outages and eventually the shutdown of major power supply dams, leaving the city without sufficient power and heat.<ref>Hollywood-on-the-Tide flats, 1938. Richard Studio Collection, Northwest Room Tacoma Public Library, Tacoma, WA.</ref> During the 30-day power shortage in the winter of 1929 and 1930, the engines of the aircraft carrier {{USS|Lexington|CV-2|6}} provided Tacoma with electricity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&File_Id=5113 |title=U.S.S.

A power grid failure paired with a newly rewritten city constitution – put into place to keep political power away from a single entity such as the railroad – created a standstill in the ability to further the local economy. Local businesses were affected as the sudden stop of loans limited progression of expansion and renewal funds for maintenance, leading to foreclosures.<ref>{{cite book |last=Mullins |first=William H. |title=The Depression and the Urban West Coast, 1929–1933: Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle, and Portland.

====Hooverville====
At the intersection of Dock Street EXD and East D Street in the train yard, a [[shanty town]] became the solution to the growing scar of the depression. Tacoma's [[Hooverville]] grew in 1924 as the homeless community settled on the waterfront.<ref name="hooverville archive 40-74">''Tacoma News Tribune''.

Collecting scraps of metal and wood from local lumber stores and recycling centers, families began building shanties (shacks) for shelter. By 1934, alcoholism and suicide were a common event in the Hooverville<ref name="hooverville archive 40-74"/><ref name="hooverville archive 24-40"/> that eventually led to its nickname of "Hollywood on the Tide Flats", because of the [[Hollywood (film industry)|Hollywood]]-style crimes and events taking place in the camp.{{explain|date=May 2017|reason=What was a "Hollywood-style crime" of the 1930s?}}

In 1935, Tacoma received national attention when [[George Weyerhaeuser]], the nine-year-old son of prominent lumber industry executive [[J.P. Weyerhaeuser]], was kidnapped<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/weyer/weyer.htm |title=Famous Cases: The Weyerhaeuser Kidnapping |work=Federal Bureau of Investigation |access-date=March 27, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312011205/http://www.fbi.gov/libref/historic/famcases/weyer/weyer.htm |archive-date=March 12, 2008 |url-status=live}}</ref> while walking home from school. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agents from Portland handled the case, in which a ransom of $200,000 secured the release of the victim. Four persons were apprehended and convicted; the last to be released was paroled from [[McNeil Island Corrections Center|McNeil Island]] in 1963. George Weyerhaeuser went on to become chairman of the board of the [[Weyerhaeuser Company]].

In 1940, after eviction notices failed, the police department attempted to burn down Hooverville.<ref name="hooverville archive 40-74"/><ref name="hooverville archive 24-40"/>

In 1956, the last occupant of "Hollywood" was evicted and the police used fire to level the grounds and make room for industrial growth.<ref>Anderson, Hilary. "A Tale of Two Shantytowns."

===Post-WWII===
In 1951, an investigation by a state legislative committee revealed widespread corruption in Tacoma's government, which had been organized commission-style since 1910. Voters approved a mayor and city-manager system in 1952.

Tacoma was featured prominently in the [[garage rock]] sound of the mid-1960s with bands including [[The Wailers (rock band)|The Wailers]] and [[The Sonics]]. The [[surf rock]] band [[The Ventures]] were also from Tacoma.

[[Downtown Tacoma]] experienced a long decline through the mid-20th century. [[Harold Moss]], later the city's mayor, characterized late-1970s Tacoma as looking "bombed out" like "downtown [[Beirut]]" (a reference to the [[Lebanese Civil War]] that occurred at that time); "Streets were abandoned, storefronts were abandoned and City Hall was the headstone and Union Station the footstone" on the grave of downtown.<ref>Erik Hanberg, [http://www.weeklyvolcano.com/2008-12-24/cover/3189/ An Exercise in Hope, Faith, Vision, and Guts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225183541/http://www.weeklyvolcano.com/2008-12-24/cover/3189/ |date=December 25, 2008}}, ''Weekly Volcano'' (Tacoma), December 24, 2008. Accessed online December 4, 2009.</ref>

The first local referendums in the U.S. on computerized voting occurred in Tacoma in 1982 and 1987. On both occasions, voters rejected the computer voting systems that local officials sought to purchase. The campaigns, organized by Eleanora Ballasiotes, a conservative Republican, focused on the vulnerabilities of computers to fraud.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ronnie |last=Dugger |title=Counting Votes |work=New Yorker |date=November 7, 1988}}</ref>

In 1998, Tacoma installed [[Click! Network]], a high-speed fiber optic network throughout the community. The municipally owned power company, [[Tacoma Power]], wired the city. In response, the State of Washington passed RCW 54.16.330 in 2000,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/1999-00/Pdf/Bills/Session%20Laws/Senate/6675-S.SL.pdf |title=SUBSTITUTE SENATE BILL 6685, WA 56th Legislature, 2000 Regular Session}}</ref> effectively preventing further research and development of Click!

===Downtown revival===
[[File:Tacoma WA aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Tacoma, Washington, the Port of Tacoma, and [[Commencement Bay]]]]
Beginning in the early 1990s, city residents and planners took steps to revitalize Tacoma, particularly its downtown. Among the projects were the federal courthouse in the former [[Union Station (Tacoma, Washington)|Union Station]] (1991); Save Our Station community group; Merritt+Pardini Architect (1991); Reed & Stem Architects (1911); the adaptation of a group of century-old brick warehouses into a branch campus of the [[University of Washington Tacoma|University of Washington]]; the numerous privately financed renovation projects near the campus; the [[Washington State History Museum]] (1996), echoing the architecture of Union Station; the [[Museum of Glass]] (2002); the [[Tacoma Art Museum]] (2003); and the region's first light-rail line (2003).<ref>Lawrence W.

The [[Pantages Theater (Tacoma, Washington)|Pantages Theater]] (first opened in 1918) anchors downtown Tacoma's Theatre District. [[Tacoma Arts Live]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.broadwaycenter.org |title=Broadway Center for the Performing Arts}}</ref> manages the Pantages, the Rialto Theater, and the Theatre on the Square. Tacoma Little Theatre (opened in 1918) is northwest of downtown in the Stadium District. Other attractions include the Grand Cinema, McMenamins Elks Temple, and the Landmark Temple Theatre.

Tacoma straddles the neighboring Commencement Bay with several smaller cities surrounding it. Large areas of Tacoma have views of Mount Rainier. In the event of a major eruption of Mount Rainier, the low-lying areas of Tacoma near the Port of Tacoma are at risk from a [[lahar]] flowing down the Puyallup River.

The city is several miles north of [[Joint Base Lewis–McChord]], formerly known separately as [[Fort Lewis (Washington)|Fort Lewis]] and [[McChord Air Force Base]].

==Government==
The government of the city of Tacoma operates under a council-manager system. The [[Tacoma City Council|city council]] consists of an elected mayor ([[Victoria Woodards]]) and eight elected council members: five from individual city council districts and three others from the city at-large. All serve four-year terms and are elected in odd-numbered years. The council adopts and amends city laws, approves a two-year budget, establishes city policy, appoints citizens to boards and commissions, and performs other actions. The council also meets in "standing committees", which examine the council's work in more defined areas, such as "Environment & Public Works", "Neighborhoods & Housing", and "Public Safety, Human Services & Education". The council meets as a whole most Tuesdays at 5:00&nbsp;p.m. in the council chambers at 747 Market St. Meetings are open to the public and provide for public input.

[[Victoria Woodards]] began her term as mayor of the City of Tacoma on January 2, 2018. She is Tacoma's third African-American mayor and third female mayor, and the second African-American female mayor. She succeeded [[Marilyn Strickland]], who was elected in 2009, becoming Tacoma's first African-American female mayor.

Normal day-to-day operations of the city government are administered by Tacoma's city manager, who is appointed by the city council. Elizabeth Pauli was appointed Interim City Manager on February 6, 2017.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Ruud |first1=Candice |title=Tacoma council picks longtime city attorney as interim city manager |url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/politics-government/article130461494.html|access-date=February 24, 2017 |publisher=The News Tribune}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=City Manager Executive Profile |url=https://www.cityoftacoma.org/government/city_departments/City_Managers_Office/city_manager_executive_profile |website=City of Tacoma|access-date=February 24, 2017}}</ref> She replaced former manager T.

==Economy==
[[File:Port of Tacoma 8276.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Port of Tacoma]], on [[Commencement Bay]], is one of the largest seaports in the [[Pacific Northwest]].]]

Tacoma is the home of several international companies, including staffing company True Blue Inc., lumber company [[Simpson Investment Company|Simpson]], and the food companies [[Roman Meal]] and [[Brown and Haley]].

[[Franklin Clarence Mars|Frank C. Mars]] founded [[Mars, Incorporated]], in 1911 in Tacoma.

Beginning in the 1930s, the city became known for the "[[Tacoma Aroma]]", a distinctive, acrid odor produced by [[Pulp (paper)|pulp and paper]] manufacturing on the industrial tide flats.

The [[Tacoma Dome]] is the city's main sports venue and opened in 1983. It hosts traveling sports and other events, such as pro-wrestling, figure-skating tours, and tours by the [[Harlem Globetrotters]]. For the 1994–95 season, the Tacoma Dome hosted home games of both the [[National Basketball Association]]'s [[Seattle SuperSonics]] (as the [[Seattle Center Coliseum]] was under renovation) and the [[American Professional Soccer League]]'s [[Seattle Sounders (1994–2008)|Seattle Sounders]]. The Tacoma Dome also hosted the 1988 and 1989 Women's NCAA Final Four.<ref>{{cite news |last=Jasmin |first=Ernest A. |date=April 13, 2003 |title=A nice, round 20 |pages=[https://www.newspapers.com/clip/114953674/a-nice-round-20/ D1], [https://www.newspapers.com/clip/114953694/a-nice-round-20-cont/ D5] |work=The News Tribune |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/114953674/a-nice-round-20/ |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |accessdate=December 29, 2022}}</ref>

The city has hosted several now-defunct minor-league [[ice hockey|hockey]] franchises. The [[Tacoma Rockets (1946–1953)|original Tacoma Rockets]] played in the [[Pacific Coast Hockey League]] from 1946 to 1953. <section begin="resurrected_rockets" />The [[Tacoma Rockets|Rockets]] were resurrected in the [[Western Hockey League]] in 1991 at the Tacoma Dome to record crowds, before [[Kelowna Rockets|moving to Kelowna, British Columbia]] in 1995.

[[Cheney Stadium]] is home to the [[Tacoma Rainiers]], a [[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]] minor league baseball team affiliated with the nearby [[Seattle Mariners]] since 1995. Minor-league baseball in the city began with the 1903–05 [[Tacoma Tigers]] of the then-independent [[Pacific Coast League]] (PCL), who were resurrected in the [[Western International League]] and played from 1922 until 1951, winning three titles.<ref>{{cite news |last=McGarth |first=John |date=May 24, 1999 |title=Tacoma to thank Clay for many feats |page=D1 |work=The News Tribune}}</ref> Following the construction of Cheney Stadium, the Tigers returned to the PCL in 1960 and were later renamed to the Rainiers.<ref>{{cite web |title=Tacoma Affiliation History |url=https://www.milb.com/tacoma/history/affiliation-history |publisher=[[Minor League Baseball]] |accessdate=December 29, 2022}}</ref> Both the Tacoma Dome and Cheney Stadium hosted events during the [[1990 Goodwill Games]], an international multi-sport competition.<ref name="WSDOT-Goodwill">{{cite report |last=Hallenbeck |first=Mark |date=May 1991 |title=Traffic Impacts During the Goodwill Games |pages=1, 10–13 |url=http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/research/reports/fullreports/232.1.pdf |publisher=[[Washington State Department of Transportation]] |accessdate=February 29, 2024}}</ref>

Tacoma has also had a long history with soccer. In men's outdoor soccer, the city is currently represented in the [[United States soccer league system#Men's leagues|third-division]] [[MLS Next Pro]] by the [[Tacoma Defiance]], [[reserve team]] of [[MLS]]'s [[Seattle Sounders FC]]. The Defiance were founded in 2015 in the [[USL Championship]] in nearby [[Tukwila, Washington]], but have been operated jointly with the Rainiers out of [[Cheney Stadium]] since 2019. The city's first professional soccer team were the [[Tacoma Tides]], who played one season in 1976 in the [[American Soccer League (1933–1983)|American Soccer League]]. This team was resurrected in 2006 as the [[Tacoma Tide]] in the [[USL PDL]], playing primarily in nearby [[Sumner, Washington]]. The Tide were folded into the Sounders organization as their U-23 team in 2012, and played until folding in 2019.

In women's outdoor soccer, [[Reign FC]] of the [[National Women's Soccer League]] played their home games at Cheney Stadium during the 2019, 2020, and 2021 seasons.<ref>{{cite news |last=Baker |first=Geoff |date=January 30, 2019 |title=Reign FC announces immediate move to Tacoma, dropping Seattle from name |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/reign/seattle-reign-womens-soccer-team-announces-immediate-move-to-tacoma/ |work=The Seattle Times |access-date=January 30, 2019}}</ref> The Reign considered plans to build a [[soccer-specific stadium]] in Tacoma, but ultimately returned to Seattle in 2022.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://soccerstadiumdigest.com/2019/01/seattle-reign-fc-to-tacoma-tacoma-defiance-new-usl-brand/ |title=Seattle Reign FC to Tacoma; Tacoma Defiance New USL Brand |last=Reichard |first=Kevin |date=January 30, 2019 |website=Soccer Stadium Digest|access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref><ref name="OLR-Return">{{Cite web |url=https://www.olreign.com/news/ol-reign-returns-home-to-seattle |title=OL Reign Returns Home to Seattle |publisher=OL Reign}}</ref>

In 1983, Tacoma's entry into indoor soccer, the [[Tacoma Stars]], began play in the Tacoma Dome as part of the [[Major Indoor Soccer League (1978–1992)|Major Indoor Soccer League]]. The [[Tacoma Stars (MISL)|original Stars]] folded in 1992, but were reformed in 2003 in the [[Professional Arena Soccer League]]. Since 2015, the new Stars have played in the [[Major Arena Soccer League]] at the [[ShoWare Center]] in nearby [[Kent, Washington]].

==Transportation==
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:TacomaStreets.gif|thumb|right|City of Tacoma, from the 2001 Comprehensive Plan]] -->
Tacoma's system of transportation is based primarily on the [[automobile]]. The majority of the city has a system of [[street grid|gridded streets]] oriented in relation to A Street (one block east of Pacific Avenue) and 6th Avenue or Division Avenue, both beginning in [[downtown Tacoma]]. Within the city, and with a few exceptions, east-to-west streets are numbered and north-to-south streets are given a name or a letter. Some east-to-west streets are also given names, such as S. Center St. and N. Westgate Blvd. Streets are generally labeled "North", "South", "East", or "North East" according to their relationship with 6th Avenue or Division Avenue (west of 'Division Ave', '6th Avenue' is the lowest-numbered street, making it the dividing street between "North" and "South"), 'A Street' (which is the dividing line between "East" and "South"), or 1st Street NE (which is the dividing line between "East" and "North East"). This can lead to confusion, as most named streets intersect streets of the same number in both north and south Tacoma. For example, the intersection of South 11th Street and South Union Avenue is just ten blocks south of North 11th Street and North Union Avenue.

To the east of the Thea Foss waterway and 'A Street', streets are similarly divided into "East" and "Northeast", with 1st Street NE being in-line with the Pierce–King county line. "North East" covers a small wedge of Tacoma and unincorporated Pierce County (around Browns Point and Dash Point) lying on the hill across the tideflats from downtown. Tacoma does have some major roads which do not seem to follow any naming rules. These roads include Schuster Pkwy, Pacific Ave, Puyallup Ave, Tacoma Mall Blvd, Marine View Dr (SR 509), and Northshore Pkwy. Tacoma also has some major roads which appear to change names in different areas (most notable are Tyler St/Stevens St, Oakes St/Pine St/Cedar St/Alder St, and S. 72nd St/S. 74th St). These major [[Arterial road|arterials]] actually shift over to align with other roads, which causes them to have the name changed.

This numeric system extends to the furthest reaches of unincorporated Pierce County (with roads outside of the city carrying "East", "West", "North West", and "South West", except on the [[Key Peninsula]], which retains the north–south streets but chooses the Pierce–Kitsap county line as the zero point for east–west streets. Until 2018, Key Peninsula's roads also carried a "KP N" or "KP S" ("Key Peninsula North" or "Key Peninsula South") designation at the end of the street name. From 2018, these designations have switched to "NW" and "SW" respectively.

In portions of the city dating back to the Tacoma Streetcar Period (1888–1938), denser mixed-use business districts exist alongside [[single family homes]]. Twelve such districts have active, city-recognized business associations and hold "small town"-style parades and other festivals. The [[Proctor|Proctor District, Tacoma]], Old Town, Dome, [[Sixth Avenue (Tacoma)|6th Avenue]], [[Stadium District, Tacoma, Washington|Stadium]], Lincoln Business District, and South Tacoma Business Districts are some of the more prominent of these and coordinate their efforts to redevelop urban villages through the Cross District Association of Tacoma.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tacomabusinessdistricts.com |title=Tacoma Business Districts |website=www.tacomabusinessdistricts.com}}</ref> In newer portions of the city to the west and south, residential [[cul-de-sac|culs-de-sac]], four-lane collector roads and indoor shopping centers are more commonplace.

===Roads and highways===
Seven highways end in or pass through Tacoma: [[I-5 (WA)|I-5]], [[I-705]], [[Washington State Route 7|SR 7]], [[Washington State Route 16|SR 16]], [[Washington State Route 163|SR 163]], [[Washington State Route 167|SR 167]], and [[Washington State Route 509|SR 509]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wspdsmap.ci.tacoma.wa.us/samples/streets.pdf |title=City of Tacoma Streets |author=City of Tacoma Community & Economic Development Department, GIS Analysis & Data Services|access-date=October 15, 2009 |date=October 8, 2009}}</ref>

The dominant intercity transportation link between Tacoma and other parts of the Puget Sound is [[Interstate 5 (Washington)|Interstate 5]], which links Tacoma with [[Seattle]] to the north and [[Portland, Oregon]], to the south. It bisects the city for {{convert|6.5|mi|km}} and has several overpasses for pedestrians and cross-traffic.<ref>{{cite news |last=Sailor |first=Craig |date=March 17, 2024 |title=It literally cut Tacoma in two 60 years ago.

===Aviation===
[[Seattle–Tacoma International Airport]] lies {{convert|22|mi|km}} north, in the city of [[SeaTac, Washington|SeaTac]]. The city of Tacoma contributed $100,000 to the airport's construction, in return for it being constructed at [[Bow Lake (SeaTac, Washington)|Bow Lake]].

==Public utilities==
Tacoma's relationship with [[public utilities]] extends back to 1893. At that time the city was undergoing a boom in population, causing it to exceed the available amount of fresh water supplied by Charles B. Wright's Tacoma Light & Water Company. In response to both this demand and a growing desire to have local public control over the utility system, the city council put up a public vote to acquire and expand the private utility. The measure passed on July 1, 1893, with 3,195 in favor of acquiring the utility system and 1,956 voting against. Since then, [[Tacoma Public Utilities]] (TPU) has grown from a small water and light utility to be the largest department in the city's government, employing about 1,200 people.

[[Tacoma Power]], a division of TPU, provides residents of Tacoma and several bordering municipalities with electrical power generated by eight hydroelectric dams on the [[Skokomish River]] and elsewhere. Environmentalists, fishermen, and the Skokomish Indian Tribe have criticized TPU's operation of Cushman Dam on the North Fork of the Skokomish River; the tribe's $6 billion claim<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fwee.org/news/getStory?story=1453 |title=Court Ends Fight Over Dams |work=Foundation for Water and Energy Education, quoting The News Tribune |access-date=March 27, 2008 |date=January 12, 2006 |first=Chris |last=Sherman}}</ref> was denied by the U.S. Supreme court<ref>{{cite web |url={{SCOTUS URL Docket|05-434}} |title=Docket for 05-434}}</ref> in January 2006. The capacity of Tacoma's [[hydroelectric]] system as of 2004 was 713,000 [[kilowatt]]s, or about 50% of the demand made up by TPU's customers (the rest is purchased from other utilities). According to TPU, hydroelectricity provides about 87% of Tacoma's power; coal 3%; natural gas 1%; nuclear 9%; and biomass and wind at less than 1%. Tacoma Power also operates the [[Click! Network]], a municipally owned [[cable television]] and internet service. The residential cost per kilowatt hour of electricity is just over 6 cents.

Tacoma Water provides customers in its service area with water from the [[Green River (Duwamish River)|Green River]] Watershed. As of 2004, Tacoma Water provided water services to 93,903 customers. The average annual cost for residential supply was $257.84.

[[Tacoma Rail]], initially a municipally owned street railway line running to the tideflats, was converted to a common-carrier rail switching utility. Tacoma Rail is self-supporting and employs over 90 people.

In addition to municipal garbage collection, Tacoma offers commingled [[recycling]] services for paper, cardboard, plastics, and metals.
