===British colonisation===
{{Further|Foundation of Melbourne}}
The first [[British Empire|British]] settlement in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], then part of the [[penal colony]] of [[New South Wales]], was established by Colonel [[David Collins (lieutenant governor)|David Collins]] in October 1803, at [[Sullivan Bay, Victoria|Sullivan Bay]], near present-day [[Sorrento, Victoria|Sorrento]]. The following year, due to a perceived lack of resources, these settlers relocated to [[Van Diemen's Land]] (present-day [[Tasmania]]) and founded the city of [[Hobart]]. It would be 30 years before another settlement was attempted.<ref>{{cite web |last=Button |first=James |title=Secrets of a forgotten settlement |website=[[The Age]] |publisher=Fairfax Media |location=Melbourne |date=4 October 2003 |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/03/1064988393029.html?from=storyrhs |access-date=19 October 2008 |archive-date=5 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105201822/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/10/03/1064988393029.html?from=storyrhs |url-status=live |url-access=registration}}</ref>

In May and June 1835, [[John Batman]], a leading member of the [[Port Phillip Association]] in Van Diemen's Land, explored the Melbourne area, and later claimed to have [[Batman's Treaty|negotiated a purchase]] of {{cvt|600000|acre|km2|disp=flip}} with eight Wurundjeri elders. However, the nature of the treaty has been heavily disputed, as none of the parties spoke the same language, and the elders likely perceived it as part of the gift exchanges which had taken place over the previous few days amounting to a [[tanderrum]] ceremony which allows temporary, not permanent, access to and use of the land.<ref>Diane E.

===Victorian gold rush===

[[File:Eureka Rebellion Prisoners Released.jpg|thumb|A large crowd outside the Victorian Supreme Court, celebrating the release of the [[Eureka Rebellion|Eureka rebels]] in 1855]]
The discovery of gold in Victoria in mid-1851 sparked [[Victorian gold rush|a gold rush]], and Melbourne, the colony's major port, experienced rapid growth. Within months, the city's population had nearly doubled from 25,000 to 40,000 inhabitants.<ref name="gold1850">{{cite web |title=Gold |first=Suzie |last=Hoban |work=Victorian Cultural Collaboration |publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]] |url=http://sbs.com.au/sbsmain/gold/story.html?storyid=49 |access-date=18 July 2008 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724135849/http://sbs.com.au/sbsmain/gold/story.html?storyid=49 |archive-date=24 July 2008}}</ref> Exponential growth ensued, and by 1865 Melbourne had overtaken [[Sydney]] as Australia's most populous city.<ref name="largeby1865">{{cite web |url=http://www.atse.org.au/index.php?sectionid=289 |title=The Snowy Mountains Scheme and Multicultural Australia |publisher=ATSE |access-date=21 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106222322/http://www.atse.org.au/index.php?sectionid=289 |archive-date=6 January 2010}}</ref>

An influx of intercolonial and international migrants, particularly from Europe and China, saw the establishment of slums, including [[Chinatown, Melbourne|Chinatown]] and a temporary "tent city" on the southern banks of the Yarra. In the aftermath of the 1854 [[Eureka Rebellion]], mass public support for the plight of the miners resulted in major political changes to the colony, including improvements in working conditions across mining, agriculture, manufacturing and other local industries. At least twenty nationalities took part in the rebellion, giving some indication of immigration flows at the time.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Hagan |first=Kate |date=3 December 2006 |url=https://www.theage.com.au/national/eureka-where-multiculturalism-was-born-20061203-ge3pjn.html |title=Eureka: where multiculturalism was born |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181115112934/https://www.theage.com.au/national/eureka-where-multiculturalism-was-born-20061203-ge3pjn.html |archive-date=15 November 2018 |newspaper=[[The Age]] |access-date=15 November 2018 |url-status=live |url-access=registration}}</ref>

With the wealth brought in from the gold rush and the subsequent need for public buildings, a program of grand civic construction soon began. The 1850s and 1860s saw the commencement of [[Parliament House, Melbourne|Parliament House]], the [[Old Treasury Building, Melbourne|Treasury Building]], the [[Old Melbourne Gaol]], [[Victoria Barracks, Melbourne|Victoria Barracks]], the [[State Library of Victoria|State Library]], [[University of Melbourne]], [[Melbourne GPO|General Post Office]], [[Immigration Museum, Melbourne|Customs House]], the [[Melbourne Town Hall]], [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Patrick's]] cathedral, though many remained incomplete for decades.

The layout of the inner suburbs on a largely one-mile grid pattern, cut through by wide radial boulevards and parklands surrounding the central city, was largely established in the 1850s and 1860s. These areas rapidly filled with the ubiquitous terrace houses, as well as with detached houses and grand mansions, while some of the major roads developed as shopping streets. Melbourne quickly became a major finance centre, home to several banks, the [[Melbourne Mint|Royal Mint]], and (in 1861) Australia's first [[Australian Securities Exchange|stock exchange]].<ref name="caslon">{{cite web |url=http://www.caslon.com.au/timeline6.htm |title=Media Business Communication time line since 1861 |publisher=Caslon |access-date=29 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121206004159/http://www.caslon.com.au/timeline6.htm |archive-date=6 December 2012}}</ref>
In 1855, the [[Melbourne Cricket Club]] secured possession of its now famous ground, the [[MCG]]. Members of the [[Melbourne Football Club]] codified [[Australian football]] in 1859,<ref>Pennings, Mark (2012). ''Origins of Australian Football: Victoria's Early History: Volume 1: Amateur Heroes and the Rise of Clubs, 1858 to 1876''. Connor Court Publishing Pty Ltd. {{ISBN|9781921421471}}, p. 11</ref> and in 1861, the first [[Melbourne Cup]] race was held. Melbourne acquired its first public monument, the [[Burke and Wills expedition|Burke and Wills]] statue, in 1864.

With the gold rush largely over by 1860, Melbourne continued to grow on the back of continuing gold-mining, as the major port for exporting the agricultural products of Victoria (especially wool) and with a developing manufacturing sector protected by high tariffs. An extensive radial railway network spread into the countryside from the late 1850s. Construction started on further major public buildings in the 1860s and 1870s, such as the [[Supreme Court of Victoria|Supreme Court]], [[Government House, Melbourne|Government House]], and the [[Queen Victoria Market]]. The central city filled up with shops and offices, workshops, and warehouses. Large banks and hotels faced the main streets, with fine townhouses in the east end of Collins Street, contrasting with tiny cottages down laneways within the blocks. The Aboriginal population continued to decline, with an estimated 80% total decrease by 1863, due primarily to introduced diseases (particularly [[smallpox]]<ref name="rbg.vic.gov.au"/>), frontier violence and dispossession of their lands.

===Land boom and bust===
[[File:Elizabeth Street Melbourne 1900.jpg|thumb|left|[[Elizabeth Street, Melbourne|Elizabeth Street]] lined with buildings from the "Marvellous Melbourne" era]]

The 1880s saw extraordinary growth: consumer confidence, easy access to credit, and steep increases in land prices led to an enormous amount of construction.

The decade began with the Melbourne International Exhibition in 1880, held in the large purpose-built [[Royal Exhibition Building|Exhibition Building]]. A telephone exchange was established that year, and the foundations of [[St Paul's Cathedral, Melbourne|St Paul's]] were laid.

To counter the trend towards low-density suburban residential growth, the government began a series of controversial public housing projects in the inner city by the [[Housing Commission of Victoria]], which resulted in the demolition of many neighbourhoods and a proliferation of high-rise towers.<ref>{{cite book |first=William |last=Logan |title=The Gentrification of inner Melbourne: a political geography of inner-city housing |publisher=[[University of Queensland Press]] |year=1985 |location=Brisbane, Australia |pages=148–160 |isbn=0-7022-1729-8}}</ref> In later years, with the rapid rise of motor vehicle ownership, the investment in freeway and highway developments greatly accelerated the outward suburban sprawl and declining inner-city population.

Melbourne experienced an economic downturn between 1989 and 1992, following the collapse of several local financial institutions.

Melbourne has a temperate [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), with warm summers and cool winters.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tapper |first1=Andrew |last2=Tapper |first2=Nigel |title=The weather and climate of Australia and New Zealand |year=1996 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Melbourne, Australia |isbn=0-19-553393-3 |edition=First |editor=Gray, Kathleen |page=300}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Linacre |first1=Edward |last2=Geerts |first2=Bart |title=Climates and Weather Explained |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1997 |page=379 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mkZa1KLHCAQC&pg=PA379 |isbn=0-415-12519-7 |access-date=17 November 2020 |archive-date=1 March 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210301173128/https://books.google.com/books?id=mkZa1KLHCAQC&pg=PA379 |url-status=live }}</ref> Melbourne is well known for its [[southerly buster|changeable weather conditions]], mainly due to it being located on the boundary of hot inland areas and the cool southern ocean. This temperature differential is most pronounced in the spring and summer months and can cause strong [[cold front]]s to form. These cold fronts can be responsible for varied forms of severe weather from [[gale]]s to [[thunderstorm]]s and [[hail]], large temperature drops and heavy rain. Winters, while exceptionally dry by south central Victorian standards, are nonetheless drizzly and overcast. The lack of winter rainfall is owed to Melbourne's [[rain shadow|rain shadowed]] location between the [[Otway Ranges|Otway]] and [[Macedon Ranges]], which block much of the rainfall arriving from the north and west.

[[Port Phillip]] is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a "bay effect", similar to the "[[lake-effect snow|lake effect]]" seen in colder climates, where showers are intensified leeward of the bay. Relatively narrow streams of heavy showers can often affect the same places (usually the eastern suburbs) for an extended period, while the rest of Melbourne and surrounds stays dry. Overall, the area around Melbourne is, owing to its rain shadow, nonetheless significantly drier than average for southern Victoria.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/rainfall |title=Rainfall |publisher=State of Victoria (Agriculture Victoria) |date=22 February 2021 |access-date=15 March 2022 |archive-date=16 March 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220316171437/http://vro.agriculture.vic.gov.au/dpi/vro/vrosite.nsf/pages/rainfall |url-status=live }}</ref> Within the city and surrounds, rainfall varies widely, from around {{cvt|425|mm|in|0}} at [[Little River, Victoria|Little River]] to {{cvt|1250|mm|in|0}} on the eastern fringe at [[Gembrook, Victoria|Gembrook]]. Melbourne receives 48.6 clear days annually. Dewpoint temperatures in the summer range from {{cvt|9.5|to|11.7|C|F}}.<ref name="Bureau">{{BoM Aust stats|site_ref=cw_086071|site_name=Melbourne Regional Office |access-date=30 October 2016}}</ref>

Melbourne is also prone to isolated convective showers forming when a [[cold pool]] crosses the state, especially if there is considerable daytime heating. These showers are often heavy and can include hail, squalls, and significant drops in temperature, but they often pass through very quickly with a rapid clearing trend to sunny and relatively calm weather and the temperature rising back to what it was before the shower. This can occur in the space of minutes and can be repeated many times a day, giving Melbourne a reputation for having "four seasons in one day",<ref name="Bureau" /> a phrase that is part of local [[popular culture]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |title=Welcome to Melbourne |publisher=City of Melbourne |access-date=18 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719171215/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=269&pg=2325 |archive-date=19 July 2008}}</ref> The lowest temperature on record is {{cvt|-2.8|C|F}}, on 21 July 1869.<ref name="Monthly climate statistics">{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_086071_All.shtml |title=Monthly climate statistics |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |access-date=30 March 2012 |archive-date=31 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191031175240/http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/averages/tables/cw_086071_All.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref> The highest temperature recorded in Melbourne city was {{cvt|46.4|C|F}}, on [[Black Saturday bushfires|7 February 2009]].<ref name="Monthly climate statistics"/> While [[snow in Australia|snow]] is occasionally seen at higher elevations in the outskirts of the city, and dustings were observed in 2020, it has not been recorded in the Central Business District since 1986.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html |archive-url=https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/awa/20090317054300/http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/96122/20090317-1643/www.bom.gov.au/lam/climate/levelthree/c20thc/temp4.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=17 March 2009 |title=BOM – Australian Climate Extremes |website=webarchive.nla.gov.au}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> 

The sea temperature in Melbourne is warmer than the surrounding ocean during the summer months, and colder during the winter months. This is predominately due to Port Phillip Bay being an enclosed and shallow bay that is largely protected from the ocean,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.emelbourne.net.au/biogs/EM01165b.htm |title=Port Phillip Bay |website=eMelbourne |access-date=29 April 2024}}</ref> resulting in greater temperature variation across seasons.

Melbourne is typical of Australian capital cities in that after the turn of the 20th century, it expanded with the underlying notion of a 'quarter acre home and garden' for every family, often referred to locally as the [[Australian Dream]].<ref>{{cite web |title=The death of the great Australian dream |website=[[The Guardian]] |date=11 March 2016 |access-date=16 April 2020 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/10/the-death-of-the-great-australian-dream |archive-date=18 February 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200218092354/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/mar/10/the-death-of-the-great-australian-dream |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Timms, Peter |title=Australia's quarter acre : the story of the ordinary suburban garden |date=2006 |publisher=Miegunyah Press |isbn=978-0-522-85185-4}}</ref> This, coupled with the popularity of the private automobile after 1945, led to the auto-centric urban structure now present today in the middle and outer suburbs. Much of [[Metropolitan area|metropolitan]] Melbourne is accordingly characterised by low-density sprawl, whilst its inner-city areas feature predominantly medium-density, transit-oriented urban forms. The city centre, Docklands, St. Kilda Road and Southbank areas feature high-density forms.

Melbourne is often referred to as Australia's garden city, and the state of Victoria is known as ''the garden state''.<ref name="Age3">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/03/10/1205125821732.html |title=Victoria: the garden state or greenhouse capital? |newspaper=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne |access-date=29 September 2008 |date=11 March 2008 |first1=Clay |last1=Lucas |first2=Royce |last2=Millar |archive-date=20 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920213131/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2008/03/10/1205125821732.html |url-status=live |url-access=registration}}</ref><ref name="wilmap">{{cite web |url=http://www.wilmap.com.au/vic.html |title=Victoria |publisher=wilmap.com.au |access-date=29 September 2008 |archive-date=12 November 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081112034738/http://www.wilmap.com.au/vic.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="goway">{{cite web |url=http://www.goway.com/downunder/australia/victoria/ |title=Victoria Australia, aka "The Garden State" |publisher=goway.com |access-date=29 September 2008 |archive-date=1 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501065213/http://www.goway.com/downunder/australia/victoria/ |url-status=live }}</ref> There is an abundance of [[Melbourne parks and gardens|parks and gardens in Melbourne]],<ref name="COM">{{cite web |url=http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=25&pg=617 |title=City of Melbourne – Parks and Gardens |publisher=City of Melbourne |access-date=28 September 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040830151740/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/info.cfm?top=25&pg=617 |archive-date=30 August 2004}}</ref> many close to the [[Melbourne Central Business District|CBD]] with a variety of common and rare plant species amid landscaped vistas, pedestrian pathways and tree-lined avenues.

===Housing===

Melbourne has minimal public housing and high demand for rental housing, which is becoming unaffordable for some.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.domain.com.au/domain/real-estate-news/city-shortage-pushes-up-rents-20110418-1dksd.html |title=City shortage pushes up rents |date=17 April 2011 |first=Andrew |last=Wilson |work=Domain |publisher=Fairfax Media |access-date=7 July 2012 |archive-date=14 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514003239/http://news.domain.com.au/domain/real-estate-news/city-shortage-pushes-up-rents-20110418-1dksd.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-rental-pressure-cooker-20100402-rjvb.html |location=Australia |website=[[The Age]] |title=The rental pressure cooker |last=Cooke |first=Dewi |date=3 April 2010 |publisher=Fairfax Media |access-date=27 April 2011 |archive-date=8 July 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708052251/http://www.theage.com.au/national/the-rental-pressure-cooker-20100402-rjvb.html |url-status=live |url-access=registration}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/melbourne-housing-now-severely-unaffordable-20110123-1a17l.html?comments=141 |location=Melbourne |website=[[The Age]] |title=Melbourne housing now 'severely unaffordable' |last=Zappone |first=Chris |date=24 January 2011 |publisher=Fairfax Media |access-date=27 April 2011 |archive-date=30 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110130170855/http://www.theage.com.au/business/melbourne-housing-now-severely-unaffordable-20110123-1a17l.html?comments=141 |url-status=live |url-access=registration}}</ref> Public housing is managed and provided by the [[Victoria State Government|Victorian Government's]] [[Department of Families, Fairness and Housing]], and operates within the framework of the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement, by which both federal and state governments provide funding for housing.

Melbourne is experiencing high population growth, generating high demand for housing. This housing boom has increased house prices and rents, as well as the availability of all types of housing. [[Subdivision (land)|Subdivision]] regularly occurs in the outer areas of Melbourne, with numerous developers offering house and land packages. However, since the release of [[Melbourne 2030]] in 2002, planning policies have encouraged [[Medium-density housing|medium-density]] and [[High density housing|high-density]] development in existing areas with good access to [[public transport]] and other services. As a result of this, Melbourne's middle and outer-ring suburbs have seen significant [[Brownfield land|brownfields]] redevelopment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://urbanmelbourne.info/projectdatabase |title=Project Database |website=Urban Melbourne |access-date=4 July 2013 |archive-date=24 June 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130624013032/http://urbanmelbourne.info/projectdatabase |url-status=dead}}</ref>

On the back of the 1850s gold rush and 1880s land boom, Melbourne became renowned as one of the world's great Victorian-era cities, a reputation that persists due to its diverse range of [[Victorian architecture]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Dovey, Kim |year=2013 |title=Fluid City: Transforming Melbourne's Urban Waterfront |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781135159719 |page=1}}</ref> High concentrations of well-preserved Victorian-era buildings can be found in the inner suburbs, such as [[Carlton, Victoria|Carlton]], [[East Melbourne, Victoria|East Melbourne]] and [[South Melbourne, Victoria|South Melbourne]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Murray, John |author2=Armstrong, Mark |year=1999 |title=Victoria: From High Country to High Culture |isbn=9780864427342 |page=39|publisher=Lonely Planet }}</ref> Outstanding examples of Melbourne's built Victorian heritage include the [[World Heritage Site|World Heritage]]-listed [[Royal Exhibition Building]] (1880), the [[General Post Office, Melbourne|General Post Office]] (1867), [[Hotel Windsor (Melbourne)|Hotel Windsor]] (1884) and the [[Block Arcade, Melbourne|Block Arcade]] (1891).<ref>{{cite web |last=Peregoy |first=Beau |date=20 March 2017 |url=https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/melbourne-stunning-victorian-architecture |title=7 Examples to Prove Melbourne Has Stunning Victorian Architecture |website=[[Architectural Digest]] |access-date=13 May 2020 |archive-date=1 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200801045955/https://www.architecturaldigest.com/gallery/melbourne-stunning-victorian-architecture |url-status=live }}</ref> Comparatively little remains of Melbourne's pre-gold rush architecture; [[St James Old Cathedral]] (1839) and [[St Francis' Church, Melbourne|St Francis' Church]] (1845) are among the few examples left in the CBD.

In line with the city's expansion during the early 20th century, suburbs such as [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] and [[Camberwell, Victoria|Camberwell]] are defined largely by [[Federation architecture|Federation]] and [[Edwardian architecture|Edwardian]] architectural styles. The [[City Baths, Melbourne|City Baths]], built in 1903, are a prominent example of the latter style in the CBD. The 1926 [[Nicholas Building]] is the city's grandest example of the [[Chicago school (architecture)|Chicago School]] style, while the influence of [[Art Deco]] is apparent in the [[Manchester Unity Building]], completed in 1932. The city also features the [[Shrine of Remembrance]], which was built as a memorial to the men and women of Victoria who served in [[World War I]] and is now a memorial to all Australians who have served in war.

Residential architecture is not defined by a single architectural style, but rather an eclectic mix of large [[McMansion]]-style houses (particularly in areas of urban sprawl), apartment buildings, condominiums, and townhouses which generally characterise the medium-density inner-city neighbourhoods. Freestanding dwellings with relatively large gardens are perhaps the most common type of housing outside inner city Melbourne. Victorian terrace housing, townhouses and historic [[Italianate]], [[Tudor revival]] and [[Georgian architecture|Neo-Georgian]] mansions are all common in inner-city neighbourhoods such as Carlton, Fitzroy and further into suburban enclaves like [[Toorak, Victoria|Toorak]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Cole |first=David B. |date=1985 |title=Gentrification, Social Character, and Personal Identity |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/214465 |journal=Geographical Review |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=142–155 |doi=10.2307/214465 |jstor=214465 |bibcode=1985GeoRv..75..142C |issn=0016-7428 |access-date=22 January 2024 |archive-date=26 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200326031322/https://www.jstor.org/stable/214465 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Roads in Victoria|road network in Victoria]] is managed by [[VicRoads|Vicroads]], as part of the [[Department of Transport (Victoria)|Department of Transport]], who oversee the planning and integration. Maintenance of roads is undertaken by different bodies, depending on the road. Local roads are maintained by local councils, while secondary and main roads are the responsibility of Vicroads. Major national freeways and roads integral to national trade are overseen by the Federal Government.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Road Management Act, regulations & codes |url=https://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/about-vicroads/acts-and-regulations/road-management-act-regulations-and-codesv |access-date=1 November 2022 |website=Vicroads}}</ref>

Today, Melbourne has an extensive network of freeways and arterial roadways. These are used by private vehicles, including road freight vehicles, as well as road-based public transport modes like buses and taxis. Major highways feeding into the city include the [[Eastern Freeway, Melbourne|Eastern Freeway]], [[Monash Freeway]] and [[West Gate Freeway]] (which spans the large [[West Gate Bridge]]). Other freeways include the [[Calder Freeway]], [[Tullamarine Freeway]], which is the main airport link, and the [[Hume Freeway]], which connects Melbourne to Canberra and Sydney. Melbourne's middle suburbs are connected via an orbital freeway, the [[M80 Ring Road]], which will be completed when the [[North East Link]] opens.<ref name="VicRoads">{{cite web |url=http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/RoadsAndProjects/RoadNetwork/ |title=Victoria's Road Network |publisher=[[VicRoads]] |access-date=5 October 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080907072720/http://www.vicroads.vic.gov.au/Home/RoadsAndProjects/RoadNetwork/ |archive-date=7 September 2008}}</ref>

Out of Melbourne's twenty declared freeways open or under construction, six are electronic toll roads.<!-- Proposed EFN: Includes the Airport Connection Road (a section of Airport Drive) and Batman Avenue. These both have at-grade intersections, but are legally considered freeways and have the same access restrictions of a standard freeway. --> This includes the [[CityLink|M1 and M2 CityLink]]<!-- Another proposed EFN: Known for administrative purposes as the Southern Link Tollway and the Western Link Tollway respectively. --> (which includes the large [[Bolte Bridge]]), [[EastLink, Melbourne|Eastlink]], North East Link, and the [[West Gate Tunnel]]. Apart from [[EastLink (Melbourne)|Eastlink]] which is owned and operated by [[ConnectEast]], the toll roads in Melbourne are run by [[Transurban]]. In Melbourne, tollways have blue and yellow signage compared to the green signs used for free roads.
