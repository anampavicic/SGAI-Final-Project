==History==
The area of the modern city of Kawachinagano was within ancient [[Kawachi Province]]. Evidence of continuous human settlement since the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period has been found. Numerous ''[[kofun]]'' [[burial mounds]] were built in the area during the [[Kofun period]],and the [[Asuka period]] scholar and diplomat [[Takamuko no Kuromaro]] came from this area. During the [[Nara period|Nara]] and [[Heian period]], numerous Buddhist temples were built, including [[Kanshin-ji]] and [[Kongō-ji]]. During the [[Nanboku-chō period]], the area was the site of many conflicts between the [[Northern Court]] and the [[Southern Court]]. During the [[Edo Period]] much of the area came under the control of [[Sayama Domain]], [[Zeze Domain]] and [[Kanbe Domain]].

After the [[Meiji restoration]], the area became part of Osaka Prefecture from 1881. The villages of Nagano, Nishigori, Shinno (later renamed Chiyoda), Amano, Mikkaichi, Kawakami, Amami, and Kaga-Tamura and Takamukai were created with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On April 1, 1896, the area became part of [[Minamikawachi District, Osaka]]. Nagano was elevated to town status on September 1, 1910. On April 1, 1954, Nagano merged with  Mikkaichi, Kawakami, Amami, Kagata, and Takamukai villages to form the city of Kawachinagano.
