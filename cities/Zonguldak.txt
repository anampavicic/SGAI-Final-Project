'''Zonguldak''' ({{IPA|tr|zoŋˈguɫdak}}) is a [[List of cities in Turkey|city]] of about 100 thousand people in the [[Black Sea region]] of [[Turkey]]. It is the seat of [[Zonguldak Province]] and [[Zonguldak District]].<ref name=il>[https://www.e-icisleri.gov.tr/Anasayfa/MulkiIdariBolumleri.aspx İl Belediyesi], Turkey Civil Administration Departments Inventory. Retrieved 1 March 2023.</ref> It was established in 1849 as a port town for the nearby coal mines in [[Karadeniz Ereğli|Ereğli]]. The current mayor is Tahsin Erdem, representing the [[Republican People's Party|CHP]].

==Etymology==
There are several different theories concerning the origin of the city's name:
* That it comes from ''Zone Geul-Dagh'', the name given to the area by [[France|French]] and [[Belgium|Belgian]] mining companies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.zonguldak.gov.tr/tarihce.asp.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927092638/http://www.zonguldak.gov.tr/tarihce.asp.htm|url-status=dead|title=Governorship of Zonguldak - A Brief History|archivedate=September 27, 2007}}</ref><ref>[http://www.zonguldakdef.gov.tr/rapor_2006/genel_bilgiler.htm Financial Manager's Office of Zonguldak - A General Description] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028190416/http://www.zonguldakdef.gov.tr/rapor_2006/genel_bilgiler.htm |date=October 28, 2007 }} {{in lang|tr}}</ref> from French "zone" and a French spelling of Turkish Göldağı ('Lake Mountain'), the highest mountain in the vicinity of the [[Devrek]] district.
* That the name came from Turkish {{lang|tr|zongalık}} which means "swamp", or {{lang|tr|zongura}}.
* That the name may derive from the name of the nearby ancient settlement of [[Sandaraca]] or Sandarake (in [[Ancient Greek]] Σανδαράκη).
* That the name may have come from "jungle" (which the French entrepreneurs called the area due to its uneven wooded geography) plus Turkish {{lang|tr|dağ}} 'mountain'.

In a 1920 report, the British Foreign Office spelled Zonguldak ''Zunguldak''.<ref name=Prothero74>{{cite book|last=Prothero|first=G.W.|title=Anatolia|year=1920|publisher=H.M. Stationery Office|location=London|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11766/view/1/74/}}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Heraclea Pontica}}

The port city of Zonguldak suffered a heavy bombardment by the Russians during World War I, according to the caption of a [[Lubok]] popular print.<ref>"[http://www.wdl.org/en/item/14730/ The Russian-Turkish War. Sinking Four Turkish Cargo Ships]." [[World Digital Library]]. Accessed May 11, 2015.</ref>

As of 1920, the port was under the control of the Heraclea Coal Company. The northern part of the bay featured a man-made harbor, for [[steamship]] use. At that time, they had two [[crane (machine)|cranes]] which distributed [[coal]] to exporting vessels.<ref name=Prothero74/>

==Climate==
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Zonguldak has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa''), though it was, until recently, considered to have an [[oceanic climate]] (''Cfb''), with its warmest month being well below the 22&nbsp;°C threshold. In recent decades [[climate change in Turkey|climate change]] and the city's [[urban heat island]] has warmed the city enough to change its classification. Summers are warm, the average temperature is around 22.5&nbsp;°C in July and August. Winters are cool, the average temperature is around 6&nbsp;°C in January and February. Precipitation is frequent, while it is generally heaviest in autumn and early winter, lightest (although still frequent) in spring. Snow is sporadic in winter, but is heavy once it occurs.

The water temperature is cool to mild and fluctuates between 8&nbsp;°C and 20&nbsp;°C throughout the year.
