==History==
{{Expand section|date=September 2024}}
During the period of [[Tughlaq dynasty]] of [[Delhi Sultanate]], a fort was built at modern day Ludhiana. It was captured by Raja [[Jasrat]] during his 1421–22 campaign in Punjab.<ref>{{Cite journal|author-link=K. S. Lal |last=Lal |first=K.

The two men camped at the site of present Ludhiana, which was then a village called Mir Hota. Yusuf Khan crossed the [[Sutlej]] and established [[Sultanpur Lodhi|Sultanpur]], while Nihad Khan founded Ludhiana on the site of Mir Hota.

The name was originally ''Lodhi-ana''", meaning "Lodhi town", which has since shifted from "Lodiana" to the present form of Ludhiana.<ref name="ludhiana.nic.in">{{cite web |title=History |url=https://ludhiana.nic.in/about-district/history/ |website=Ludhiana |publisher=Government of Punjab |access-date=23 July 2020 |archive-date=19 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201019204635/https://ludhiana.nic.in/about-district/history/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Lodhi Fort ( Purana Qila)|Lodhi Fort]], or "''Purana Qila''", is the only surviving structure in the city from this period; located in the neighbourhood of [[Fatehgarh Sahib district|Fatehgarh]], it was well-maintained under [[Ranjit Singh]] and the British after him, but then fell into disrepair.

The Semi Centennial Celebration of the American Presbyterian Lodiana Mission was held in Ludhiana from 3–7 December 1884.<ref>J.J. Lucas, "Literary Work of the American Presbyterian Mission, North India, Including Bible TranslatioLun and Revision, and Circulation of Religious Books and Tracts," ''Indian Evangelical Review'' 13 (July 1886): 43-63.</ref>

Ludhiana's Old City includes landmarks like the Lodhi Fort, Daresi Grounds, The Clock Tower, & Sood Family Haveli.{{cn|date=January 2024}}

==Geography==
Ludhiana is located at {{Coord|30.9|N|75.85|E|format=dms|display=inline}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/23/Ludhiana.html|title=Falling Rain Genomics, Inc&nbsp;– Ludhiana|work=fallingrain.com|access-date=8 June 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529001025/http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/23/Ludhiana.html|archive-date=29 May 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> It has an average elevation of {{convert|244|m}}. Ludhiana City, to its residents, consists of the Old City and the New City. The new city primarily consists of the Civil Lines area which was historically known as the residential and official quarters of the colonial British encampment.

The land dips steeply to the north and the west where, before 1785, the river Sutlej ran.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The Old Fort was at the banks of the Sutlej (and now houses the College of Textile Engineering). Legend has it that a tunnel connects it to the fort in [[Phillaur]]– although why this should be is debatable, as the Sutlej was the traditional dividing line between the principalities, often occupied by enemy forces (see History section).

The ground is of yellow sandstone and granite, forming small hillocks, plateaus and dips.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

The tree of largest natural extraction was the kikar, or ''[[Vachellia nilotica subsp. indica|Acacia Indica]]'', but has been supplanted by the eucalyptus, transplanted from rural Australia in the late 1950s by the Chief Minister [[Partap Singh Kairon]].

[[Delonix regia|Gulmohars]] and [[jacaranda]]s were planted by the British along the avenues of Civil Lines, as were other flowering trees, while the Old City contains almost no vegetation or parks, except for a few isolated [[Ficus religiosa|pipal]] trees, holy to the Hindus, as it is supposed to be the abode of Lord Shiva.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}

===Climate===
Ludhiana features a relatively dry monsoon-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cwa'') under the [[Köppen climate classification]], although bordering on a [[semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh''), with three defined seasons; summer, monsoon and winter. Ludhiana on an average sees roughly {{convert|809.3|mm|in}} of precipitation annually. The official weather station for the city is in the compound of the Civil Surgeon's Office to the west of Ludhiana. Weather records here date back to 1 August 1868.

Ludhiana has one of the worst air pollution problems in India since 2011, with particulate matter being over six times the [[World Health Organization]] recommended standard, making it the 13th most polluted city in the world.<ref name="Majeed">{{Cite news|author=Majeed, Shariq |date=26 March 2014 |title=Ludhiana worries over its PM |newspaper=The Times of India |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/Ludhiana-worries-over-its-PM/articleshow/32709885.cms |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327153327/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ludhiana/Ludhiana-worries-over-its-PM/articleshow/32709885.cms |archive-date=27 March 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|author=Preet, Jatinder|date=16 October 2011|title=Ludhiana fourth most polluted city in the world|location=Delhi, India|newspaper=The Sunday Guardian|url=http://www.sunday-guardian.com/news/ludhiana-fourth-most-polluted-city-in-the-world|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412184445/http://www.sunday-guardian.com/news/ludhiana-fourth-most-polluted-city-in-the-world|archive-date=12 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Industrial water pollution is also of significant concern in portions of Ludhiana, notably along the [[Buddha Nullah|Budha Dariya]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=1 December 2013|title=How air and water pollution plagues Indian cities|newspaper=Hindustan Times|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-air-and-water-pollution-plagues-indian-cities/article1-1157717.aspx|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140129025745/http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-air-and-water-pollution-plagues-indian-cities/article1-1157717.aspx|archive-date=29 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>
