'''Calama''' is a [[List of cities in Chile|city]] and [[Communes of Chile|commune]] in the [[Atacama Desert]] in northern [[Chile]]. It is the capital of [[El Loa Province]], part of the [[Antofagasta Region]]. Calama is one of the driest cities in the world with average annual precipitation of just {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The [[River Loa]], Chile's longest, flows through the city. Calama has a population of 147,886 (2012 [[census]]).

The commune also encompasses the [[Quechua people|Quechua]] communities of Estación San Pedro, [[Toconce]] and Cupo; and the [[Lickan-antay]] communities of Taira, Conchi Viejo, [[Lasana]], [[San Francisco de Chiu Chiu]], [[Ayquina|Aiquina-Turi]], and [[Caspana]].

In 2003 the nearby town of Chuquicamata, once the largest open-pit copper mine in the world, was dismantled citing environmental reasons and encroachment from the mine's expansion. Residents of Chuquicamata then moved to Calama, away from company-owned residences, to find housing on their own.

==Etymology ==
There are a variety of hypotheses about the origin of the name "Calama," but the two main accounts suggest that it comes from the [[Kunza]] language, spoken in the past by the [[Lickan-antay]], an ethnic group that resides in the [[El Loa Province]].

Hector Pumarino Soto suggests that "Calama" stems from the Kunza word "Ckara-ama," which means "town in the middle of the water".{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}  Until the middle of the 20th century, the urban site of Calama and the surrounding oasis were flanked by the [[River Loa]] on two sides, and the fertile plain and swamps on the other sides, giving the location the appearance of an island in the middle of the desert surrounded completely by water.

Emilio Vaïsse, meanwhile, says that Calama comes from the Kunza word "Ckolama," which means "place where [[partridge]]s abound".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Vaisse |first1=Emilio F. |title=Glosario de la lengua atacameña |journal=Anales de la Universidad de Chile |date=1 January 1895 |pages=ág. 527–556 |doi=10.5354/anuc.v0i-.20911 |doi-broken-date=1 November 2024 |url=https://revistas.uchile.cl/index.php/ANUC/article/view/20911 |language=es |issn=0717-8883}}</ref>  This is supposed testimony to the abundance of such a bird, living over everything in the middle of the western swamp sector.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

== History ==
=== Prehispanic Era ===
The exact evidence related to the history of Calama does exist, including [[petroglyph]]s and the caves of Yalquincha (NE of the city), the chullpas of Topáter (pre-Columbian cemeteries to the east of the city), the Copper Mummy, and other remains in [[Chuquicamata]].

At the intersection of the [[Inca road system|Camino del Inca]] (the longitudinal one) and the routes that crossed the coast of the Altiplano, Calama became the main shelter of the Despoblado of Atacama.  Their extensive lands for growing [[Maize|corn]] and [[alfalfa]] give testimony of the high capacity to supply food to the troops of Chasquis and to give tribute to the [[Inca]].  In fact, when [[Diego de Almagro]], returning from [[Cusco]], passed by the Calama shelter, the natives gave him copper horseshoes, which were made using a mysterious Incan technique used by towns conquered by the Incas.  The science of such a technique still has yet to be explained, but the presence of such horseshoes further suggests strong Incan influence in Prehispanic times.

=== Hispanic Era ===
[[File:Límite entre Chile y Perú en el río Loa, Plano General del Reyno de Chile en la América Meridional de Andrés Baleato (1793) (Editado).jpg|left|thumb|1793 Andrés Baleato's map showing the internal border of Chile and Peru in the [[Loa River]] during the [[Spanish Empire]] with Calama in the jurisdiciton of Chile.]]
Spanish colonization obviously caused some changes; however, the hostile climate impeded establishment of greater control.  These changes influenced the control of trade routes that crossed the desert and communication to the port of Cobija with the deposits of Potosí [[silver]] and the cattle farms of Salta and Tucumán.  In this sense, Calama continued as a main point of provision for commercial routes.  In the 18th century, with the [[Bourbon Reforms]].
Calama was included in maps of the [[Captaincy General of Chile]] in the 18th century, depending from the city of [[Copiapó]].<ref>[https://es.scribd.com/document/105213842/Breve-Historia-de-Las-Fronteras-de-Chile-Jaime-Eyzaguirre Jaime Eyzaguirre (1967). BREVE HISTORIA DE LAS FRONTERAS DE CHILE.]</ref>

=== Bolivian Republic Era ===
After [[Bolivia]]'s Declaration of Independence (6 August 1825), and with gradual changes in the administration of the territory, Calama remained constituted under the Departamento de Litoral (1829), subdivided in the Provincia de Lamar y la Provincia de Atacama (Cobija being the departmental capital). Calama was an important town in the [[Atacama Province, Chile|Atacama Province]], through which traveled the weekly mail between Cobija and Salta-Potosí, since 1832. In 1840, the provincial capital transferred from Chiuchiu to Calama, increasing the communication boom.

The [[Atacama border dispute|border conflicts between Chile and Bolivia]] did not reach either Calama or the Atacama Province.  The greater dispute concentrated in the central prairie and in the coast, where they began to discover rich silver deposits, [[Sodium nitrate|saltpeter]], and [[guano]].  The ambiguity that led to the frontier conflicts was the possession of the central plain and the Atacama coast.  The environment was made tense when Chilean troops, under the command of [[colonel]] Emilio Sotomayor Baeza, invaded the port of [[Antofagasta]] on the morning of February 14, 1879.  Later, Bolivia declared war on Chile on March 1.

===Chilean Republic Era===

Since that day, the changes in the administration have been very deep.  It being part of the administrative center of 2° order in Bolivia, returned as one of 4° order under the Chilean administration (subdelegation).  In 1888, under the government of [[José Manuel Balmaceda]], Calama returned as an administrative center of 3° order, inaugurated as the municipality on 13 October.  Prior to that, in 1886, Calama was chosen for a railway station of the [[Ferrocarril de Antofagasta a Bolivia|Antofagasta-Bolivia Railway]], which further expedited shipments through Calama.

==Geography and climate==
Calama has two distinct entities: the [[desert]] and the [[Andes]] Mountain Range.  Between {{convert|2000|and|3000|m|0|abbr=on}}, the [[desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|BWk]]) is characterized by annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] that does not surpass {{convert|35|mm|in}}.  The average temperature is {{convert|11.2|C}} throughout the year with drastic changes between average daily highs of over {{convert|20|C}} and average daily lows below {{convert|0|C}} in winter and record highs of over {{convert|30|C}} in summer. Light easterly winds are common in the mornings with strong westerly winds in the afternoon.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wunderground.com/q/zmw:00000.21.85432|title = Local Weather Forecast, News and Conditions &#124; Weather Underground}}</ref>

The Cerro Poquis (4,589 m), is the maximum altitude, north of [[Chuquicamata]]. South of it begin the foothills of the Cordillera de Domeyko, which in turn serve to chart the southern boundary of the district, with the names of Sierra de Limón Verde and Cordon Barros Arana. The passage of Loa river from east to west leaves a plain, in which the city of Calama and the oasis is located.
