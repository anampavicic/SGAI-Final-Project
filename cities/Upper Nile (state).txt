'''Upper Nile''' is a [[States of South Sudan|state]] in [[South Sudan]]. The [[White Nile]] flowes through the state, giving it its name. The state also shares a similar name with the region of [[Greater Upper Nile]], of which it was part along with the states of [[Unity (state)|Unity]] and [[Jonglei]]. It had an area of {{convert|77823|km2}}. [[Malakal]] was the capital of the state. The towns of Upper Nile State [[Benythieng]] Akoka, [[Melut]], [[Renk, South Sudan|Renk]], [[Kodok]], the location of the [[Fashoda Incident]] that ended the "[[Scramble for Africa]]", was located in the state. Upper Nile seceded from [[Sudan]] as part of the Republic of South Sudan on 9 July 2011.

In October 2015, the states of South Sudan were reorganized into 28 states by President [[Salva Kiir]]. This was reversed as the result of a peace agreement signed on 22 February 2020.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2020/02/6-years-war-peace-finally-south-sudan-200223114919537.html |title = After 6 years of war, will peace finally come to South Sudan? {{!}} News {{!}} Al Jazeera}}</ref>
