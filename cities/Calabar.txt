=== Seaport, slave trade ===
When [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] explorers in the 15th century reached this part of the [[Guinea (region)|Guinea]] coast, they called the tribes of the area "Calabar". These historic inhabitants were Efiks, Ibibios and [[Ekoi people|Quas]]. The [[Efik people]] migrated from the area of the [[Niger River]] to the shores of the Calabar. They were fleeing civil war with their kindred and the [[Ibibio people]].<ref name="EB1911">{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Calabar|volume=4|page=962}}</ref>[[File:Nigeria Calabar Port 11.81.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A merchantman docked in Calabar, 1981]]

Since the 16th century, Calabar has served as an international [[seaport]], exporting such goods as [[palm oil]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Africans: The History of a Continent |first=John |last=Iliffe |edition=illustrated, reprint |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-521-48422-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlHE51ScKTUC&pg=PA149 |page=149}}</ref> During the centuries of the [[Atlantic slave trade]], it became a major port for shipment of African slaves to the Americas. The Spanish named it Calabar. 

Tribes around that region were taken in as slaves for slave trades. Such tribes included the [[Igbo people|Igbo]] tribes (communities) who lived around that region at the time. Those minority tribes were subject to slave raids by more powerful tribes or ethnic groups in the region.<ref>{{cite book |title=Murder at Montpelier: Igbo Africans in Virginia |first=Douglas B. |last=Chambers |edition=illustrated |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=2005 |isbn=1-57806-706-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PrPxWLSrp78C&pg=RA1-PA22 |page=22}}</ref>

From 1725 until 1750, roughly 17,000 enslaved Africans were sold from Calabar to European slave traders; from 1772 to 1775, the number soared to more than 62,000.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Two Princes of Calabar: An Eighteenth-century Atlantic Odyssey |first=Randy J. |last=Sparks |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-674-01312-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tt6BCT-9yEgC&pg=PA39 |page=39}}</ref> Old Calabar (Duke Town) and [[Creek Town]], {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} northeast, were crucial towns in the trade of slaves in that era.<ref name=overview/> 

In 1807, [[Great Britain]] abolished the slave trade.<ref>{{cite web |title=How did the slave trade end in Britain? |publisher=Royal Museums Greenwich |url=https://www.rmg.co.uk/stories/topics/how-did-slave-trade-end-britain |access-date=2024-07-05 |language=en}}</ref> In 1815 {{HMS|Comus|1806|6}}, as part of the British [[blockade of Africa]], sailed into [[Duke Town]], where she captured seven Spanish and Portuguese [[slave ship]]s.<ref>{{cite RNB1823 |wstitle=Pierce, George |volume=4 |part=2 |page=129}}.</ref>

[[John Jea]], an enslaved [[African American]], came from the area. He later became a writer. A small [[mulatto]] community of merchants was located here that had links to missionary and other merchant colonies in Igboland, [[Lagos]], and across the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic.]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=Calabar Town in Cross-River Nigeria Guide|url=https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Nigeria/States_Nigeria/Cross-River/History-of-Calabar-in-Cross-River.html|access-date=2022-02-03|website=www.nigeriagalleria.com}}</ref>

In 1846, [[Scottish people|Scottish]] Presbyterians established a mission station in Calabar. Among the missionaries, Hope Waddell, who worked in Calabar from 1845 to 1858, and Mary Slessor, who evangelized Christianity in Calabar from 1876 to 1915, worked to improve treatment by and among the native peoples. They influenced many Efik people to [[Conversion to Christianity|convert to Christianity]].

They tried to change or abolish the following traditional practices:

* Killing newborn twins,
* Human sacrifice at the death of village elders (to provide servants for them in the afterlife),<ref>{{Cite web |title=Calabar |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Calabar |access-date=2024-01-19 |language=en}}</ref>
* [[Trial by ordeal#By poison|"Judgment of God"]], in which suspects in crime were poisoned, and convicted if they fell ill or died

They founded a school to provide secondary education to Africans. They also worked to protect water supplies and limit mosquitoes to contain [[yellow fever]] epidemics.

Waddell and Slessor are still honoured in Calabar today; streets and squares in the city were named for them.

=== Colonial times ===
On 10 September 1884, [[Queen Victoria]] signed a treaty of protection with the king and chiefs of Akwa Akpa, known to [[Ethnic groups in Europe|Europeans]] as Old Calabar—then the official title to distinguish it from [[New Calabar]] to the east.<ref name="EB1911" /> This enabled the United Kingdom to exercise control over the entire territory around Calabar, including [[Bakassi]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Brief History of Cross-River State |url=https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Nigeria/States_Nigeria/Cross-River/Brief-History-of-Cross-River-State.html |access-date=2018-07-05 |website=Nigeriagalleria |language=en-NG}}</ref> Calabar was the headquarter of the European administration in the [[Niger Delta]] until 1906 when the seat of government was moved to [[Lagos]].<ref name="EB1911" />

Calabar developed earlier, albeit less vigorously than [[Lagos]], with which it is sometimes compared because of some parallels. Calabar has the following achievements:<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Calabar City: The Nations Paradise |url=https://www.holidaynigeria.com.ng/index.php/holiday-nigeria-blog/67-calabar-the-trail-blazers-paradise |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=holidaynigeria.com.ng}}</ref>

From 1914 until the 1960s, a mail steamer of the [[Elder Dempster Lines|Liverpool Elder-Dempster Line]] called at Calabar every month. In addition to letters and parcels, it also delivered newspapers, and cargo and carried up to 100 passengers to [[Lagos]], [[Port Harcourt]] and Calabar.

In 1922, British governor [[Hugh Clifford (colonial administrator)|Clifford]] established the Legislative Council. The four elected members were from Lagos (3) and Calabar (1). The Legislative Council enacted laws for the colony and the protectorate of Southern Nigeria. It also approved the annual budget for the entire country. The four elected members were the first Africans to be elected to a parliamentary body in British West Africa. 

The Clifford Constitution led to the formation of political parties in Nigeria. [[Herbert Macaulay]], a newspaper owner and grandson of [[Samuel Ajayi Crowther]], in 1923 founded the first Nigerian political party, the [[Nigerian National Democratic Party|Nigeria National Democratic Party]]. It remained the strongest party in the elections until 1939.

In 1926, Governor Graeme Thomson attempted to introduce a [[poll tax]] in southeast Nigeria, including Calabar. It would reduce the number of Africans eligible to vote in elections. The people reacted with strong protests, which Nigerians call the "Women's War", for many of its leaders, and the British termed the "Aba Riots". These riots spread from the neighbouring town of Aba to Calabar. Several administrative buildings were destroyed and more than 50 women died at the hands of colonial forces.<ref>{{cite book |last=Falola |first=Toyin |title=A History of Nigeria |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-521-68157-5 |pages=120–130}}</ref>

=== Biafra War ===
After independence in 1960, tensions increased between the North and South areas of the country, which were strongly affiliated with Muslims and Christians, respectively. In addition, the South had a concentration of educated people who were politically powerful and had a history of trade and interaction with other communities. 

The Southeastern area decided to become independent and declared itself as the Republic of Biafra in 1967. It included Calabar. In October 1967, an armada of the Nigerian Navy left the harbour of Bonny on a naval campaign en route to Calabar. The ships carried troops of the Nigerian 3rd Naval Division under the command of Colonel Benjamin Adekunle. At this time, Calabar was being defended by the 9th Battalion of Biafrans under the command of Major Ogbo Oji. On 17 October, the Biafran defences on the beaches of Calabar came under heavy air and naval fire. Less than 24 hours later, the Nigerian 8th Battalion under the command of Major Ochefu went ashore at Lokoja and captured the Calabar cement factory.<ref name=":8">{{Cite book |last=Vetner |first=Al J. |title=Biafra's War 1967–1970: A Tribal Conflict That Left a Million Dead |publisher=Helion & Company |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-910294-69-7 |location=Warwick, UK |pages=197–210 |language=en}}</ref>

Later that day, the Nigerian 33rd Battalion landed on the beach at Calabar. The Biafran resistance was overwhelmed. After Nigerian troops advanced into Calabar from three different positions, bloody hand-to-hand fighting ensued. After suffering heavy losses, the remaining mercenaries retreated northward and fled Biafra.<ref name=":8" /> After three years, the country reunited under the Nigerian central government.

== Economy ==
Today's economy of the megacity of Calabar is dominated by:

* The local administration as the state capital of [[Cross River State|Cross River]],
* The centrally located naval base ([[Nigerian Navy|Nigeria's navy]] is the strongest in West and Central Africa<ref>{{Cite web |date=2019-10-12 |title=10 Strongest Navies in Africa Today (2024) - Nigerian Queries |url=https://nigerianqueries.com/strongest-navies-in-africa/ |access-date=2024-01-19 |language=en-US}}</ref>),
* the harbour (see below),
* the airport (see below) and
* the free trade zone.

The state government of Cross River is trying to stimulate [[tourism]] in Calabar. The initiation of the ''Calabar Carnival'' in 2004 by the then Governor [[Donald Duke]] is probably the most successful measure to advance tourism in Calabar.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-12-28 |title=Carnival Calabar Returns With Bang, As Otu Host World Revelers |url=https://news.crossriverstate.gov.ng/carnival-calabar-returns-with-bang-as-otu-host-world-revelers/ |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=Cross River State Latest News and Events |language=en}}</ref>

== Transport ==

=== Margaret Ekpo Airport ===
[[File:Calabar International Airport, Cross river.jpg|thumb|[[Margaret Ekpo International Airport]]]]
[[Margaret Ekpo International Airport]] was inaugurated in 1983 by then-President Shagari. [[Lufthansa]], [[British Airways]] and [[Air France–KLM|KLM/Air France]] fly to the airport from Calabar with a stopover in [[Lagos]] or [[Abuja]] (the last leg of the flight is operated by the regional airlines [[Air Peace]], [[Ibom Air]] and [[Aero Contractors (Nigeria)|Aero Contractors]]).

=== The Old Harbour and the New Harbour ===
The Calabar Port Complex consists of the Old Port, the New Port and the Dockyard and is responsible for the petroleum terminals at Antan, Odudu, Yoho and QuaIboe as well as other jetties at NIWA, McIver, NNPC, ALSCON, Dozzy and Northwest. The three terminals at the Port of Calabar are operated by "world-class terminal operators, namely: ECM Terminal Ltd, INTELS Nigeria Ltd and Shoreline Logistics Nigeria Limited", according to the port operating company NPA.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=npa2016 |title=Calabar Port Complex |url=https://nigerianports.gov.ng/calabar/ |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=Nigerian Ports Authority |language=en-US}}</ref>

The port of Calabar's profile in the oil and gas industry is fast gaining traction as the business is to capitalise on import and export opportunities by providing an efficient port service system that guarantees fast turnaround time of vessels and faster cargo clearance.<ref name=":2" />

Calabar is a multi-purpose facility. The harbour consists of 2 terminals, A and B, and 2 smaller berths in the "Old Harbour" area. It has a channel draught of 7.5 metres. The terminals are operated by private operators under concession agreements. Terminal B, which occupies 80% of the harbour area, is operated under a concession by ECM Terminals Ltd; Intels LTD and Addak are the other terminal operators.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2.1.5 Nigeria Port of Calabar {{!}} Digital Logistics Capacity Assessments |url=https://dlca.logcluster.org/215-nigeria-port-calabar |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=dlca.logcluster.org}}</ref>

== Tourist attractions ==
Calabar sees itself as the "tourism capital of Nigeria". This is supported by the state government.<ref name=":3">{{Citation |title=Africa's biggest Carnival in Nigeria {{!}} 2023 Calabar Carnival |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r2LI12wNabU |access-date=2024-01-19}}</ref>

=== Museums ===

==== Slave History Museum ====
One of the five main themes of the museum is the Esuk Mba slave market in Akpabuyo. The slave trade in Calabar was based on slave raiding and trading, which mainly took place in the hinterland, where the enslaved were mostly prisoners of war. The prisoners of war were collected at this market and sold as slaves to slave traders.<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |title=Slave History Museum, Calabar {{!}} Slavery and Remembrance |url=https://slaveryandremembrance.org/partners/partner/?id=P0027 |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=slaveryandremembrance.org}}</ref>

Another exhibition shows objects from the slave trade, including chains and shackles. The traders used these to prevent resistance while transporting as many people as possible over long distances.<ref name=":4" />

One exhibition shows the various means of payment used in the slave trade, from copper bars, manillas and Danish guns to brass bells, gongs, flutes and more. The arrangement of the slaves on a ship is artistically illustrated. The slaves were arranged in different positions depending on where they were accommodated on the ship, either sitting, standing or side by side. These positions were maintained until the ships reached their destination in the New World - a crossing that could take several months.<ref name=":4" />

Finally, another exhibition traces the efforts of abolitionists such as William Wilberforce, Thomas Clarkson and Granville Sharp, who saw the slave trade as morally reprehensible and a matter of natural rights. They therefore put forward twelve proposals for abolition. A British Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade of 25 March 1807 finally stipulated that the slave trade should be abolished by law from 1 May 1807.<ref name=":4" />

The [[Media Trust|Daily Trust Nigeria]] reported the museum's decline. However, the negative report could be due to the COVID wave that was rampant at the time.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-24 |title=Why Calabar History Museum no longer attracts traffic |url=https://dailytrust.com/why-calabar-history-museum-no-longer-attracts-traffic/ |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=Daily Trust |language=en-GB}}</ref>

==== National Museum resp. Old Residency Museum ====
[[File:Old Residency, National Museum, Calabar 02.jpg|thumb|National Museum Calabar]]
The ''National Museum of Calabar'' was flat packed, shipped from Britain and built-in 1884<ref>{{cite news |last1=Van Zeijl |first1=Femke |title=From slave trading post to royal prison |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/program/my-nigeria/2015/9/27/from-slave-trading-post-to-royal-prison/ |access-date=4 June 2024 |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=27 September 2015}}</ref> (it is sometimes incorrectly stated to have been built in 1959). It was formerly the government building or the governor's residence during colonial rule, which was built in Britain and then shipped in parts to Calabar. The Calabar National Museum is made of old Scandinavian pine and has preserved centuries-old relics, especially documents, furnishings and artefacts from the colonial era.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-09-07 |title=Eleven Top Tourist Attractions in Calabar |url=https://blog.vectatravels.com/top-tourist-attractions-in-calabar/ |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=Vecta Travels Blog |language=en-US}}</ref> The museum houses the relics of the slave trade, including the names of the people who supported the slave trade and the currency of the slave trade. The Calabar National Museum, designed and built by the colonisers in Glasgow, houses souvenirs from the slave trade. In 1959, the building became a national monument.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Godlewski |first=Joseph |date=2020-05-30 |title=Drawing from the archives: notes on the Old Residency in Calabar, Nigeria |url=https://medcraveonline.com/AHOAJ/AHOAJ-04-00160.pdf |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=MedCrave}}</ref>
[[File:Hand sculpture roundabout, Calabar, Cross River state2.jpg|left|thumb|The Calabar hand sculpture]]
The National Museum was once the home of a British governor. It is located in Calabar, Cross River State, and displays unique artefacts and historical heritage.

On a tour of the museum, you can see the furnishings used by Europeans during the slave trade and colonial period. You can also see the constitutions in their original documents, which are kept in a large library.<ref>{{Cite web |title=National Museum in Calabar What's On In Calabar |url=https://www.whatsonincalabar.com/national-museum-calabar/ |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=What's On In Calabar |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Calabar's most impressive monument is located in the park of the National Museum. It depicts two chained hands.

[[Mary Slessor|Mary Mitchell Slessor]] was a Scottish missionary sent to Nigeria by the United Presbyterian Church in the 19th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mary Slessor Building Cross River State:: Nigeria Information & Guide |url=https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Nigeria/States_Nigeria/Cross-River/Mary-Slessor-Building.html |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=www.nigeriagalleria.com}}</ref> ''Mary Slessor's House'', built around 1880 in Akpap Village, Calabar, Cross River State, is one of the monuments dedicated to her memory.

Originally, the house was a mud house with two bedrooms, a verandah, a shop and a parlour. She referred to it as a "trailer", but the locals called it a "good pass all". In 1889, Mr Owens, a carpenter at the mission, was hired to build a more permanent structure for her. The walls were made of iron plates with wooden doors and windows.<ref name=":5">{{Citation |title=Project Nigeria: Mary Slessor House Calabar |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PD7pk-foDRo |access-date=2024-01-19 |language=en}}</ref>

When Southern Nigeria became a British protectorate, Miss Slessor acted as a female magistrate and skilful diplomatic ambassador. For her efforts in Okoyong, she was given the Efik name Obongawan Okoyong (Queen of Okoyong).<ref name=":5" />

She was also instrumental in the establishment of the Hope Waddell Training Institute in Calabar, which provided vocational training for Efiks. Miss Slessor is widely regarded as a heroine in Nigerian history, and the Mary Slessor House stands as a historical site in honour of the missionary in Ekenge, Calabar, Cross River State.<ref name=":5" />

==== Tinapa Resort and Monorail ====
The ''Tinapa Resort'' seems to have fallen into disrepair during the Covid epidemic. Pictures on a travel website show broken windows and various pioneer plants around the vacant building.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tinapa (Calabar) - Lohnt es sich?

=== The Drill Rehabilitation Centre ===
[[File:Drill (Mandrillus leucophaeus).jpg|thumb|Drill]]
The ''Drill Rehabilitation Centre'' nature reserve was founded in 1991 and is the first rehabilitation project for primates in the region. Drills orphaned by hunting are donated by local citizens or handed over after confiscation by the authorities; no animals are bought or taken from the wild. More than 75 drills have been rescued and reunited with conspecifics after a thorough medical examination. Drills have reproduced poorly in western zoos, but the DRBC has recorded over 250 births from rehabilitated wild-born parents and their offspring, making the project the world's most successful captive breeding programme for an endangered primate. Today, 286 drills live in 6 family groups, each in their own natural habitat in an electrified enclosure of up to 9 hectares. There are plans to release the first group back into the wild. The Drill Ranch is also home to 28 orphaned chimpanzees. As the closest relatives of humans, chimpanzees contribute greatly to the education of visitors by arousing interest and sympathy for the animal world. The project has two locations. The original site in Calabar, the capital of Cross River State, is where it all began. Today, the "Drill Ranch Calabar" serves as the project's headquarters, office, quarantine centre for new animals and veterinary practice, as well as accommodation for the managers and rotating volunteer staff. One of the project's 6 drill breeding groups is also located here so that anyone living in or visiting the state capital has the opportunity to see drills. This group now comprises 39 animals in 4 generations, including the first drill. Drill Ranch Calabar is also home to a chimpanzee nursery - the project's youngest chimpanzees live here, where they receive round-the-clock care and supervision before moving to Afi Ranch at the age of 6-8 years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pandrillus » Drill Ranch |url=https://www.pandrillus.org/projects/drill-ranch/ |access-date=2024-01-19}}</ref>
