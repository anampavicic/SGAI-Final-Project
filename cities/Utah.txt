'''Utah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|t|ɑː}} {{respell|YOO|tah}}, {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Utah.ogg|ˈ|juː|t|ɔː}} {{respell|YOO|taw}}) is a landlocked state in the [[Mountain states|Mountain West]] subregion of the [[Western United States]].  It is one of the [[Four Corners]] states, sharing a border with [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], and [[New Mexico]].  It also borders [[Wyoming]] to its northeast, [[Idaho]] to its north, and [[Nevada]] to its west. In comparison to all the U.S. states and territories, Utah, with a population of just over three million, is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|13th largest by area]], the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|30th most populous]], and the [[List of U.S. states by population density|11th least densely populated]]. Urban development is mostly concentrated in two regions: the [[Wasatch Front]] in the north-central part of the state, which includes the state capital, [[Salt Lake City]], and is home to roughly two-thirds of the population; and [[Washington County, Utah|Washington County]] in the southwest, which has somewhat more than 180,000 residents.<ref>{{citation |url= http://governor.utah.gov/dea/QGET/DataBook/4.htm |contribution= Introduction: Urban Growth in Utah |title= QGET Databook |year= 1997 |publisher= Quality Growth Efficiency Tools (QGET) Technical Committee, Governor's Office of Management & Budget, State of Utah |access-date= November 4, 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104164218/http://governor.utah.gov/DEA/QGET/DataBook/4.htm |archive-date= November 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |df= mdy-all }}; see also: {{citation |url= http://governor.utah.gov/DEA/QGET/DataBook/Figures/db3.html |contribution= Figures: Population Growth, 1940–2020 (slide 3) |title= QGET Databook |year= 1997 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104164243/http://governor.utah.gov/DEA/QGET/DataBook/Figures/db3.html |archive-date= November 4, 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date= November 4, 2014 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Most of the western half of Utah lies in the [[Great Basin]].

Utah has been inhabited for thousands of years by various [[Indigenous people of the United States|indigenous groups]], such as the [[Ancestral Puebloans|ancient Puebloans]], the Navajo, and the Ute. The first Europeans to arrive -  in the mid-16th century - were the Spanish. Because of the region's challenging geography and harsh climate, it only became a peripheral part of [[New Spain]] (and later of Mexico). Even while it was Mexican territory, many of the Utah region’s earliest European settlers were from the United States; notable among these were Mormons who were fleeing marginalization and persecution in the United States and arrived via the so-called [[Mormon Trail]]. In 1848, after the [[Mexican–American War]], the region was [[Mexican Cession|annexed by the U.S.]], becoming part of the [[Utah Territory]], which included what later became Colorado and Nevada. Disputes between the dominant Mormon community and the federal government delayed Utah's admission as a state: in 1896, after it agreed to outlaw polygamy, it was admitted as the [[List of U.S. states by date of admission to the Union|45th state]].

===Pre-Columbian===
{{see also|Native Americans in Utah}}
[[File:California1838.jpg|thumb|Map showing Utah in 1838 when it was part of Mexico, ''Britannica'' 7th edition]]

Thousands of years before the arrival of Europeans, the [[Ancestral Puebloans]] and the [[Fremont culture|Fremont]] people lived in what is now known as Utah, some of which spoke languages of the [[Uto-Aztecan]] group. Ancestral Pueblo peoples built their homes through [[excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] in mountains, and the Fremont people built houses of straw before disappearing from the region around the 15th century.

Another group of Native Americans, the [[Navajo people|Navajo]], settled in the region around the 18th century. In the mid-18th century, other Uto-Aztecan tribes, including the [[Goshute]], the [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]], the [[Shoshone]], and the Ute people, also settled in the region. These five groups were present when the first European explorers arrived.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/american_indians/nativeamericansinutah.html|title=Native Americans in Utah|website=historytogo.utah.gov|access-date=July 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625180359/http://historytogo.utah.gov/utah_chapters/american_indians/nativeamericansinutah.html|archive-date=June 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ilovehistory.utah.gov/people/first_peoples/tribes/|title=Utah's American Indians|website=ilovehistory.utah.gov|language=en|access-date=July 9, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170625190631/http://ilovehistory.utah.gov/people/first_peoples/tribes/|archive-date=June 25, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Spanish exploration (1540)===

{{Main|New Spain|The Californias#History|First Mexican Empire|Provisional Government of Mexico|First Mexican Republic|Centralist Republic of Mexico}}

The southern Utah region was explored by the Spanish in 1540, led by [[Francisco Vázquez de Coronado]] while looking for the legendary [[Seven Cities of Gold|Cíbola]]. A group led by two Catholic priests—sometimes called the [[Domínguez–Escalante expedition]]—left [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] in 1776, hoping to find a route to the coast of California. The expedition traveled as far north as [[Utah Lake]] and encountered the native residents. The Spanish made further explorations in the region but were not interested in colonizing the area because of its desert nature. In 1821, the year Mexico achieved its independence from Spain, the region became known as part of its territory of [[Alta California]].

European trappers and [[fur traders]] explored some areas of Utah in the early 19th century from Canada and the United States. The city of [[Provo, Utah]], was named for one [[Étienne Provost]], who visited the area in 1825. The city of [[Ogden, Utah]], was named after [[Peter Skene Ogden]], a Canadian explorer who traded furs in the Weber Valley.

In late 1824, [[Jim Bridger]] became the first known English-speaking person to sight the [[Great Salt Lake]]. Due to the high [[salinity]] of its waters, he thought he had found the Pacific Ocean; he subsequently learned this body of water was a giant [[salt lake]]. After the discovery of the lake, hundreds of American and Canadian traders and trappers established trading posts in the region. In the 1830s, thousands of migrants traveling from the Eastern United States to the American West began to make stops in the region of the Great Salt Lake, then known as Lake Youta.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}

[[File:BrighamYoung1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Brigham Young]] led the first [[Mormon pioneers]] to the Great Salt Lake.]]

Following the [[death of Joseph Smith]] in 1844, [[Brigham Young]], as president of the [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve]], became the leader of the LDS Church in [[Nauvoo, Illinois]].<ref>[[Leonard J. Arrington]] and [[Davis Bitton]]: ''The Mormon Experience'', page 22. Vintage/Random House, 1979.</ref> To address the growing conflicts between his people and their neighbors, Young agreed with Illinois Governor [[Thomas Ford (politician)|Thomas Ford]] in October 1845 that the Mormons would leave by the following year.<ref>Richard N. Ostling and Joan K. Ostling: ''Mormon America'', page 38–39. HarperCollins, 2000.</ref>

Young and the first group of Mormon pioneers reached the [[Salt Lake Valley]] on July 24, 1847. Over the next 22 years, more than 70,000 pioneers crossed the plains and settled in Utah.<ref>William W. Slaughter and Michael Landon: ''Trail of Hope—The Story of the Mormon Trail''. [[Shadow Mountain Publishing|Shadow Mountain]], 1997.</ref> For the first few years, Brigham Young and the thousands of early settlers of Salt Lake City struggled to survive. The arid desert land was deemed desirable by the Mormons as a place where they could practice their religion without harassment.

Settlers buried thirty-six Native Americans in one grave after an outbreak of measles occurred during the winter of 1847.<ref name=Arave>{{cite news |last1=Arave |first1=Lynn |title=Tidbits of history — Unusual highlights of Salt Lake County |url=https://www.deseret.com/2007/1/5/19993469/tidbits-of-history-151-unusual-highlights-of-salt-lake-county#part-of-downtown-salt-lake-city-will-soon-be-redeveloped-by-the-lds-church-for-decades-the-salt-lake-temple-stood-out-as-the-areas-most-prominent-structure |access-date=May 6, 2020 |work=Deseret News |date=January 5, 2007}}</ref>

Utah was a Mexican territory when the first pioneers arrived in 1847. Early in the [[Mexican–American War]] in late 1846, the United States had taken control of [[Capture of Santa Fe|New Mexico]] and California. The entire Southwest [[Mexican Cession|became U.S. territory]] upon the signing of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], February 2, 1848. The treaty was ratified by the [[United States Senate]] on March 11. Learning that California and New Mexico were applying for statehood, the settlers of the Utah area (originally having planned to petition for territorial status) applied for statehood with an ambitious plan for a [[State of Deseret]].

The Mormon settlements provided pioneers for other settlements in the West. Salt Lake City became the hub of a "far-flung commonwealth"<ref>Arrington and Bitton, p. 118</ref> of Mormon settlements. With new church converts coming from the East and around the world, Church leaders often assigned groups of church members as missionaries to establish other settlements throughout the West. They developed irrigation to support fairly large pioneer populations along Utah's Wasatch front (Salt Lake City, Bountiful and Weber Valley, and Provo and Utah Valley).<ref>[[William Clayton (Mormon)|William Clayton]], edited by George D. Smith: ''An Intimate Chronicle: The Journals of William Clayton'', p. 300. [[Signature Books]], 1991.</ref> Throughout the remainder of the 19th century, Mormon pioneers established hundreds of other settlements in Utah, [[Idaho]], [[Nevada]], [[Arizona]], [[Wyoming]], [[California]], [[Canada]], and [[Mexico]]—including in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]; [[Franklin, Idaho]] (the first European settlement in Idaho); [[San Bernardino, California]]; [[Mesa, Arizona]]; [[Star Valley|Star Valley, Wyoming]]; and [[Carson Valley, Nevada]].

Prominent settlements in Utah included [[St. George, Utah|St. George]], [[Logan, Utah|Logan]], and [[Manti, Utah|Manti]] (where settlers completed the LDS Church's first three [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]] in Utah, each started after but finished many years before the larger and better-known temple built in Salt Lake City was completed in 1893), as well as Parowan, Cedar City, Bluff, Moab, Vernal, Fillmore (which served as the territorial capital between 1850 and 1856), Nephi, Levan, Spanish Fork, Springville, Provo Bench (now [[Orem]]), Pleasant Grove, American Fork, Lehi, Sandy, Murray, Jordan, Centerville, Farmington, Huntsville, Kaysville, Grantsville, Tooele, Roy, Brigham City, and many other smaller towns and settlements. Young had an expansionist view of the territory that he and the Mormon pioneers were settling, calling it Deseret—which according to the [[Book of Mormon]] was an ancient word for "honeybee". This is symbolized by the beehive on the Utah flag, and the state's motto, "Industry".<ref>Corporation of the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints: "Church History in the Fullness of Times". 1989.</ref>

The Utah Territory was much smaller than the proposed state of Deseret, but it still contained all of the present states of Nevada and Utah as well as pieces of modern Wyoming and [[Colorado]].<ref>Michael S. Durham: ''Desert between the Mountains'', pages 162,163. University of Oklahoma Press, 1997.</ref> It was created with the [[Compromise of 1850]], and [[Fillmore, Utah|Fillmore]], named after President [[Millard Fillmore]], was designated the capital. The territory was given the name Utah after the Ute tribe of Native Americans. Salt Lake City replaced Fillmore as the territorial capital in 1856.

By 1850, there were around 100 black people in the territory, the majority of whom were slaves.<ref name=smith>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=idktzKdgb7YC|title=Dictionary of Afro-American Slavery|author=John David Smith|isbn=9780275957995|year=1997|publisher=Bloomsbury Academic }}</ref> In Salt Lake County, 26 slaves were counted.<ref name="Arave"/> In 1852, the territorial legislature passed the [[Act in Relation to Service]] and the [[Act for the relief of Indian Slaves and Prisoners]] formally legalizing slavery in the territory. Slavery was abolished in the territory during the Civil War.

In 1850, Salt Lake City sent out a force known as the [[Nauvoo Legion]] and engaged the [[Timpanogos]] in the [[Battle at Fort Utah]].<ref name=Farmer>{{cite book|last1=Farmer|first1=Jared|title=On Zion's Mount: Mormons, Indians, and the American Landscape|date=2008|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674027671}}</ref>{{rp|71}}

Disputes between the Mormon inhabitants and the [[Government of the United States|U.S. government]] intensified due to the practice of [[plural marriage]], or [[polygamy]], among members of the LDS Church. The Mormons were still pushing for the establishment of a State of Deseret with the new borders of the Utah Territory. Most, if not all, of the members of the U.S. government opposed the polygamous practices of the Mormons.

Members of the LDS Church were viewed as un-American and rebellious when news of their polygamous practices spread. In 1857, particularly heinous accusations of abdication of government and general immorality were leveled by former associate justice William W. Drummond, among others. The detailed reports of life in Utah caused the administration of [[James Buchanan]] to send a secret military "expedition" to Utah. When the supposed rebellion should be quelled, [[Alfred Cumming (governor)|Alfred Cumming]] would take the place of Brigham Young as territorial governor. The resulting conflict is known as the [[Utah War]], nicknamed "Buchanan's Blunder" by the Mormon leaders.

In September 1857, about 120 American settlers of the Baker–Fancher wagon train, en route to California from Arkansas, were murdered by [[Nauvoo Legion#In Utah|Utah Territorial Militia]] and some [[Southern Paiute|Paiute]] Native Americans in the [[Mountain Meadows massacre]].<ref>{{cite news |last= Ravitz |first= Jessica |url= http://www.sltrib.com/ci_6862682 |title= LDS Church Apologizes for Mountain Meadows Massacre |newspaper= The Salt Lake Tribune |date= September 11, 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104171210/http://www.sltrib.com/ci_6862682 |archive-date= November 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Before troops led by [[Albert Sidney Johnston]] entered the territory, Brigham Young ordered all residents of Salt Lake City to evacuate southward to [[Utah Valley]] and sent out the Nauvoo Legion to delay the government's advance. Although wagons and supplies were burned, eventually the troops arrived in 1858, and Young surrendered official control to Cumming, although most subsequent commentators claim that Young retained true power in the territory. A steady stream of governors appointed by the president quit the position, often citing the traditions of their supposed territorial government. By agreement with Young, Johnston established [[Camp Floyd]], {{convert|40|mi|km|-1}} away from Salt Lake City to the southwest.

Salt Lake City was the last link of the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]], completed in October 1861. Brigham Young was among the first to send a message, along with [[Abraham Lincoln]] and other officials.

Because of the [[American Civil War]], federal troops were pulled out of Utah Territory in 1861. This was a boon to the local economy as the army sold everything in camp for pennies on the dollar before marching back east to join the war. The territory was then left in LDS hands until [[Patrick Edward Connor|Patrick E. Connor]] arrived with a regiment of California volunteers in 1862. Connor established [[Fort Douglas (Utah)|Fort Douglas]] just {{convert|3|mi|km}} east of Salt Lake City and encouraged his people to discover mineral deposits to bring more non-Mormons into the territory. Minerals were discovered in [[Tooele County, Utah|Tooele County]] and miners began to flock to the territory.

Beginning in 1865, [[Utah's Black Hawk War]] developed into the deadliest conflict in the territory's history. Chief [[Antonga Black Hawk]] died in 1870, but fights continued to break out until additional federal troops were sent in to suppress the [[Ghost Dance]] of 1872. The war is unique among [[Indian Wars]] because it was a three-way conflict, with mounted Timpanogos [[Ute Tribe|Utes]] led by Antonga Black Hawk fighting federal and LDS authorities.

On May 10, 1869, the [[First transcontinental railroad]] was completed at [[Promontory Summit]], north of the Great Salt Lake.<ref name="WDL">{{cite web |url = http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/ |title = Ceremony at "Wedding of the Rails", May 10, 1869 at Promontory Point, Utah |website = [[World Digital Library]] |date = May 10, 1869 |access-date = July 20, 2013 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131018052635/http://www.wdl.org/en/item/11371/ |archive-date = October 18, 2013 |url-status = live }}</ref> The railroad brought increasing numbers of people into the territory and several influential businesspeople made fortunes there.

During the 1870s and 1880s laws were passed to punish polygamists due, in part, to stories from Utah. Notably, [[Ann Eliza Young]]—tenth wife to divorce Brigham Young, women's advocate, national lecturer, and author of ''Wife No.{{nbsp}}19 or My Life of Bondage''—and Fanny Stenhouse, author of ''Tell It All: My Life in Mormonism'', testified to the happiness of the very early Church members before polygamy. They independently published their books in 1875. These books and the lectures of Ann Eliza Young have been credited with the United States Congress's passage of anti-polygamy laws by newspapers throughout the United States, as recorded in "The Ann Eliza Young Vindicator", a pamphlet which detailed Ms. Young's travels and warm reception throughout her lecture tour.

T. B. H. Stenhouse, former Utah Mormon polygamist, a Mormon missionary for thirteen years, and a Salt Lake City newspaper owner, finally left Utah and wrote ''The Rocky Mountain Saints''. His book gives a witnessed account of life in Utah, both the good and the bad. He finally left Utah and Mormonism after financial ruin occurred when Brigham Young sent Stenhouse to relocate to Ogden, Utah, according to Stenhouse, to take over his thriving pro-Mormon ''Salt Lake Telegraph'' newspaper. In addition to these testimonies, ''The Confessions of John D. Lee'', written by John D. Lee—alleged "Scapegoat" for the [[Mountain Meadow Massacre]]—also came out in 1877. The corroborative testimonies coming out of Utah from Mormons and former Mormons influenced Congress and the people of the United States.

In the [[1890 Manifesto]], the LDS Church banned polygamy. When Utah [[Utah Constitutional Convention of 1895|applied for statehood again]], it was accepted. One of the conditions for granting Utah statehood was that a ban on polygamy be written into the state constitution. This was a condition required of other western states that were admitted into the Union later. Statehood was officially granted on January 4, 1896.

===20th century to present===

[[File:Children reading 1940.jpg|thumb|Children reading in [[Santa Clara, Utah]], in 1940]]

Beginning in the early 20th century, with the establishment of such national parks as [[Bryce Canyon National Park]] and [[Zion National Park]], Utah became known for its natural beauty. Southern Utah became a popular filming spot for arid, rugged scenes featured in the popular mid-century western film genre. From such films, most US residents recognize such natural landmarks as [[Delicate Arch]] and "the Mittens" of [[Monument Valley]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mountainproject.com/v/monument-valley/105964237|title=Rock Climbing Monument Valley in Northern Arizona|website=Mountain Project|access-date=November 7, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151029035231/http://www.mountainproject.com/v/monument-valley/105964237|archive-date=October 29, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> During the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, with the construction of the [[Interstate highway]] system, accessibility to the southern scenic areas was made easier.

Since the establishment of [[Alta Ski Area]] in 1939 and the subsequent [[Development of Skiing in Utah|development of several ski resorts]] in the state's mountains, Utah's skiing has become world-renowned. The dry, powdery snow of the [[Wasatch Range]] is considered some of the best skiing in the world (the state license plate once claimed "the Greatest Snow on Earth").<ref>[http://www.skinet.com/travel/2008-09/ski-magazines-top-30-resorts-2008-09 SKI Magazine's Top 30 Resorts for 2008–09] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210021223/http://www.skinet.com/travel/2008-09/ski-magazines-top-30-resorts-2008-09 |date=February 10, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/ski/2008-10-20-outside-best-ski-resorts_N.htm |title='Outside' magazine ranks the top ski resorts |website=USA Today |date=October 17, 2008 |access-date=July 31, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100526174205/http://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/ski/2008-10-20-outside-best-ski-resorts_N.htm |archive-date=May 26, 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Salt Lake City won the bid for the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games]], and this served as a great boost to the economy. The ski resorts have increased in popularity, and many of the Olympic venues built along the [[Wasatch Front]] continue to be used for sporting events. Preparation for the Olympics spurred the development of the light-rail system in the [[Salt Lake Valley]], known as [[UTA TRAX|TRAX]], and the reconstruction of the freeway system around the city.

In 1957, Utah created the Utah State Parks Commission with four parks. Today, [[Utah State Parks]] manages 43 parks and several undeveloped areas totaling over {{convert|95000|acre|km2}} of land and more than {{convert|1000000|acre|km2}} of water. Utah's state parks are scattered throughout Utah, from [[Bear Lake State Park (Utah)|Bear Lake State Park]] at the Utah/Idaho border to [[Edge of the Cedars State Park]] Museum deep in the [[Four Corners]] region and everywhere in between. Utah State Parks is also home to the state's [[off highway vehicle]] office, state boating office, and the trails program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stateparks.utah.gov/about/|title=Official Utah State Parks website|publisher=Stateparks.utah.gov|access-date=November 7, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407044150/http://www.stateparks.utah.gov/about|archive-date=April 7, 2013}}</ref>

During the late 20th century, the state grew quickly. In the 1970s growth was phenomenal in the suburbs of the Wasatch Front. [[Sandy, Utah|Sandy]] was one of the fastest-growing cities in the country at that time. Today, many areas of Utah continue to see boom-time growth. Northern [[Davis County, Utah|Davis]], southern and western [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake]], [[Summit County, Utah|Summit]], eastern [[Tooele County, Utah|Tooele]], [[Utah County, Utah|Utah]], [[Wasatch County, Utah|Wasatch]], and [[Washington County, Utah|Washington]] counties are all growing very quickly. Management of transportation and urbanization are major issues in politics, as development consumes agricultural land and wilderness areas and transportation is a major reason for poor [[air quality in Utah]].

Utah is known for its natural diversity and is home to features ranging from arid deserts with [[dune]]s to thriving [[pine tree|pine]] forests in mountain valleys. It is a rugged and geographically diverse state at the convergence of three distinct geological regions: the [[Rocky Mountains]], the [[Great Basin]], and the [[Colorado Plateau]].

Utah covers an area of {{convert|84899|sqmi|abbr=on}}. It is one of the [[Four Corners]] states and is bordered by Idaho in the north, Wyoming in the north and east, Colorado in the east, at a single point by [[New Mexico]] to the southeast, by Arizona in the south, and by Nevada in the west. Only three U.S. states (Utah, Colorado, and Wyoming) have exclusively latitude and longitude lines as boundaries.

One of Utah's defining characteristics is the variety of its [[terrain]]. Running down the middle of the state's northern third is the [[Wasatch Range]], which rises to heights of almost {{convert|12000|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. Utah is home to world-renowned [[ski resort]]s made popular by light, fluffy snow and winter storms that regularly dump up to three feet of it overnight. In the state's northeastern section, running east to west, are the [[Uinta Mountains]], which rise to heights of over {{convert|13,000|ft|m}}. The highest point in the state, [[Kings Peak (Utah)|Kings Peak]], at {{convert|13,528|ft|m}},<ref name="usgs">{{cite web|date=April 29, 2005 |url=http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#Highest |title=Elevations and Distances in the United States |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |access-date=November 8, 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102095332/http://erg.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html |archive-date=November 2, 2006 }}</ref> lies within the Uinta Mountains.

At the western base of the Wasatch Range is the [[Wasatch Front]], a series of valleys and basins that are home to the most populous parts of the state. It stretches approximately from [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]] at the north end to [[Nephi, Utah|Nephi]] at the south end. Approximately 75 percent of the state's population lives in this corridor, and population growth is rapid.

Western Utah is a mostly arid desert with a [[Basin and Range Province|basin and range]] topography. Small mountain ranges and rugged terrain punctuate the landscape. The [[Bonneville Salt Flats]] are an exception, being comparatively flat as a result of once forming the bed of ancient [[Lake Bonneville]]. Great Salt Lake, [[Utah Lake]], [[Sevier Lake]], and [[Rush Lake (Tooele County, Utah)|Rush Lake]] are all remnants of this ancient freshwater lake,<ref>{{cite book|title=The Great Salt Lake|last=Morgan|first=Dale L.|publisher=[[University of Utah Press]]|location=Salt Lake City|year=1947|page=22|isbn=978-0-87480-478-2}}</ref> which once covered most of the eastern Great Basin. West of the [[Great Salt Lake]], stretching to the Nevada border, lies the arid [[Great Salt Lake Desert]]. One exception to this aridity is [[Snake Valley (Great Basin)|Snake Valley]], which is (relatively) lush due to large springs and wetlands fed from [[groundwater]] derived from snow melt in the [[Snake Range]], [[Deep Creek Range]], and other tall mountains to the west of Snake Valley. [[Great Basin National Park]] is just over the Nevada state line in the southern Snake Range. One of western Utah's most impressive, but least visited attractions is [[Notch Peak]], the tallest limestone cliff in North America, located west of [[Delta, Utah|Delta]].

Much of the scenic southern and southeastern landscape (specifically the [[Colorado Plateau]] region) is [[sandstone]], specifically [[Kayenta Formation|Kayenta sandstone]] and [[Navajo sandstone]]. The [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]] and its tributaries wind their way through the sandstone, creating some of the world's most striking and wild terrain (the area around the confluence of the Colorado and Green Rivers was the last to be mapped in the lower 48 United States). Wind and rain have also sculpted the soft sandstone over millions of years. Canyons, gullies, arches, pinnacles, buttes, bluffs, and mesas are common sights throughout south-central and southeast Utah.

This terrain is the central feature of protected state and federal parks such as [[Arches National Park|Arches]], [[Bryce Canyon National Park|Bryce Canyon]], [[Canyonlands National Park|Canyonlands]], [[Capitol Reef National Park|Capitol Reef]], and [[Zion National Park|Zion]] national parks, [[Cedar Breaks National Monument|Cedar Breaks]], [[Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument|Grand Staircase–Escalante]], [[Hovenweep National Monument|Hovenweep]], and [[Natural Bridges National Monument|Natural Bridges]] national monuments, [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area]] (site of the popular tourist destination, [[Lake Powell]]), [[Dead Horse Point State Park|Dead Horse Point]] and [[Goblin Valley State Park|Goblin Valley]] state parks, and [[Monument Valley]]. The [[Navajo Nation]] also extends into southeastern Utah, and the tribe is part of the coalition that manages [[Bears Ears National Monument]]. Southeastern Utah is also punctuated by the remote, but lofty [[La Sal Mountains|La Sal]], [[Abajo Mountains|Abajo]], and [[Henry Mountains|Henry]] mountain ranges.

Eastern (northern quarter) Utah is a high-elevation area covered mostly by plateaus and basins, particularly the Tavaputs Plateau and [[San Rafael Swell]], which remain mostly inaccessible, and the [[Uinta Basin]], where the majority of eastern Utah's population lives. Economies are dominated by mining, [[oil shale]], [[Petroleum|oil]], and natural gas-drilling, [[ranching]], and [[recreation]]. Much of eastern Utah is part of the [[Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation]]. The most popular destination within northeastern Utah is [[Dinosaur National Monument]] near [[Vernal, Utah|Vernal]].

Southwestern Utah is the lowest and hottest spot in Utah. It is known as Utah's [[Dixie (Utah)|Dixie]] because early settlers were able to grow some cotton there. [[Beaverdam Wash]] in far southwestern Utah is the lowest point in the state, at {{convert|2,000|ft|m}}.<ref name="usgs"/> The northernmost portion of the [[Mojave Desert]] is also located in this area. Dixie is quickly becoming a popular recreational and retirement destination, and the population is growing rapidly. Although the Wasatch Mountains end at [[Mount Nebo (Utah)|Mount Nebo]] near [[Nephi, Utah|Nephi]], a complex series of mountain ranges extends south from the southern end of the range down the spine of Utah. Just north of Dixie and east of [[Cedar City, Utah|Cedar City]] is the state's highest ski resort, [[Brian Head Ski Resort|Brian Head]].

Like most of the [[The West (U.S.)|western]] and [[Southwest United States|southwestern]] states, the [[Government of the United States|federal government]] owns much of the land in Utah. Over 70 percent of the land is either [[Bureau of Land Management|BLM]] [[public land|land]], Utah State Trustland, or [[U.S. National Forest]], [[U.S. National Park]], [[U.S. National Monument]], [[National Recreation Area]] or [[U.S. Wilderness Area]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0304/Utah-fights-for-states-rights-with-land-push|title=Utah fights for states' rights with land push|last=Farrell|first=Michael B.|newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=March 4, 2014|access-date=October 19, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020072312/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/2010/0304/Utah-fights-for-states-rights-with-land-push|archive-date=October 20, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Utah is the only state where every county contains some national forest.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.utah.gov/governor/docs/OutdoorRecreationVision.pdf |title=The state of Utah outdoor recreation vision. |date=January 2013 |access-date=October 13, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181111174839/https://www.utah.gov/governor/docs/OutdoorRecreationVision.pdf |archive-date=November 11, 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Köppen Climate Types Utah.png|left|thumb|300x300px|[[Köppen climate classification|Köppen climate types]] of Utah, using 1991–2020 [[Climatological normal|climate normals]].]]
Utah features a dry, [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid]] to [[desert climate]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-12-14 |title=Why is Utah so dry? - 2022 |url=https://theflatbkny.com/united-states/why-is-utah-so-dry/ |access-date=2022-06-10 |website=The Flat |language=en-US}}</ref> although its many mountains feature a large variety of climates, with the highest points in the [[Uinta Mountains]] being above the [[Tree line|timberline]]. The dry weather is a result of the state's location in the [[rain shadow]] of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] in California. The eastern half of the state lies in the rain shadow of the [[Wasatch Mountains]]. The primary source of precipitation for the state is the Pacific Ocean, with the state usually lying in the path of large Pacific storms from October to May. In summer, the state, especially southern and eastern Utah, lies in the path of [[monsoon]] moisture from the [[Gulf of California]].

Most of the lowland areas receive less than {{convert|12|in|mm|0}} of precipitation annually, although the [[Interstate 15 in Utah|I-15]] corridor, including the densely populated [[Wasatch Front]], receives approximately {{convert|15|in|mm|0}}. The Great Salt Lake Desert is the driest area of the state, with less than {{convert|5|in|mm|0}}. Snowfall is common in all but the far southern valleys. Although St. George receives only about {{convert|3|in|mm|0}} per year, Salt Lake City sees about {{convert|60|in|mm|0}}, enhanced by the [[lake-effect snow]] from the Great Salt Lake, which increases snowfall totals to the south, southeast, and east of the lake.

Some areas of the [[Wasatch Range]] in the path of the lake effect receive up to {{convert|500|in|cm|0}} per year. This micro climate of enhanced snowfall from the Great Salt Lake spans the entire proximity of the lake. The cottonwood canyons adjacent to Salt Lake City are located in the right position to receive more precipitation from the lake.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Steenburgh|first1=Jim|title=Secrets of the Greatest Snow on Earth|date=November 14, 2014|publisher=Utah State University Press|isbn=978-0874219500|edition=1}}</ref> The consistently deep powder snow led Utah's ski industry to adopt the slogan "the Greatest Snow on Earth" in the 1980s. In the winter, [[temperature inversion]]s are a common phenomenon across Utah's low basins and valleys, leading to thick haze and fog that can last for weeks at a time, especially in the [[Uintah Basin]]. Although at other times of year, its air quality is good, winter inversions give Salt Lake City some of the worst wintertime pollution in the country.

Previous studies have indicated a widespread decline in snowpack over Utah accompanied by a decline in the snow–snow-precipitation ratio while anecdotal evidence claims have been put forward that measured changes in Utah's snowpack are spurious and do not reflect actual change. A 2012 study<ref>[http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00084.1 2012 study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512142725/http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00084.1 |date=May 12, 2017 }}, journals.ametsoc.org.</ref> found that the proportion of winter (January–March) precipitation falling as snow has decreased by nine percent during the last half century, a combined result of a significant increase in rainfall and a minor decrease in snowfall. Meanwhile, observed snow depth across Utah has decreased and is accompanied by consistent decreases in snow cover and surface albedo. Weather systems with the potential to produce precipitation in Utah have decreased in number with those producing snowfall decreasing at a considerably greater rate.<ref>Gillies et al. (2012) http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00084.1 {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170512142725/http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-11-00084.1 |date=May 12, 2017 }}</ref>

Utah's temperatures are extreme, with cold temperatures in winter due to its elevation, and very hot summers statewide (except mountain areas and high mountain valleys). Utah is usually protected from major blasts of cold air by mountains lying north and east of the state, although major Arctic blasts can occasionally reach the state. Average January high temperatures range from around {{convert|30|F|C|0}} in some northern valleys to almost {{convert|55|F|C|0}} in St. George.

Temperatures dropping below {{convert|0|F|C|0}} should be expected on occasion in most areas of the state most years, although some areas see it often (for example, the town of [[Randolph, Utah|Randolph]] averages about fifty days per year with temperatures that low). In July, average highs range from about {{convert|85|to|100|F|C|0}}. However, the low humidity and high elevation typically lead to large temperature variations, leading to cool nights on most summer days.

Utah, like most of the western United States, has few days of thunderstorms. On average there are fewer than 40 days of thunderstorm activity during the year, although these storms can be briefly intense when they do occur. They are most likely to occur during [[North American Monsoon|monsoon]] season from about mid-July through mid-September, especially in southern and eastern Utah. Dry lightning strikes and the generally dry weather often spark wildfires in summer, while intense thunderstorms can lead to [[flash flood]]ing, especially in the rugged terrain of southern Utah. Although spring is the wettest season in northern Utah, late summer is the wettest period for much of the south and east of the state. Tornadoes are uncommon in Utah, with an average of two striking the state yearly, rarely higher than EF1 intensity.<ref>[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif Annual Average Number of Tornadoes, 1953–2004] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016174155/http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/img/climate/research/tornado/small/avgt5304.gif |date=October 16, 2011 }}.

===Tourism===

Tourism is a major industry in Utah. With five [[national parks]] (Arches, Bryce Canyon, Canyonlands, Capitol Reef, and Zion), Utah has the third most national parks of any state after [[Alaska]] and California. In addition, Utah features eight [[National monument (United States)|national monuments]] ([[Cedar Breaks National Monument|Cedar Breaks]], [[Dinosaur National Monument|Dinosaur]], [[Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument|Grand Staircase–Escalante]], [[Hovenweep National Monument|Hovenweep]], [[Natural Bridges National Monument|Natural Bridges]], [[Bears Ears National Monument|Bears Ears]], [[Rainbow Bridge National Monument|Rainbow Bridge]], and [[Timpanogos Cave National Monument|Timpanogos Cave]]), two [[national recreation area]]s ([[Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area|Flaming Gorge]] and [[Glen Canyon National Recreation Area|Glen Canyon]]), seven [[United States National Forest|national forests]] ([[Ashley National Forest|Ashley]], [[Caribou-Targhee National Forest|Caribou-Targhee]], [[Dixie National Forest|Dixie]], [[Fishlake National Forest|Fishlake]], [[Manti-La Sal National Forest|Manti-La Sal]], [[Sawtooth National Forest|Sawtooth]], and [[Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest|Uinta-Wasatch-Cache]]), and numerous [[Utah State Parks|state parks]] and monuments.

The [[Moab, Utah|Moab]] area, in the southeastern part of the state, is known for its challenging mountain biking trails, including [[Slickrock Trail|Slickrock]]. Moab also hosts the famous [[Moab Jeep Safari]] semiannually.

Utah has seen an increase in tourism since the [[2002 Winter Olympics]]. [[Park City, Utah|Park City]] is home to the [[United States Ski Team]]. Utah's ski resorts are primarily located in northern Utah near Salt Lake City, Park City, Ogden, and [[Provo, Utah|Provo]]. Between 2007 and 2011 [[Deer Valley]] Park City, has been ranked the top ski resort in North America in a survey organized by ''Ski Magazine''.<ref>{{cite news |last= Gorrell |first= Mike |date= October 5, 2010 |title= Deer Valley maintains Ski ranking through downturn |url= http://www.sltrib.com/50411844-79/valley-deer-resort-colo.html |newspaper= The Salt Lake Tribune |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141104171414/http://www.sltrib.com/50411844-79/valley-deer-resort-colo.html |archive-date= November 4, 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====Branding====

The state of Utah relies heavily on income from tourists and travelers visiting the state's parks and ski resorts, and thus the need to "brand" Utah and create an impression of the state throughout the world has led to several state slogans, the most famous of which is "The Greatest Snow on Earth", which has been in use in Utah officially since 1975 (although the slogan was in unofficial use as early as 1962) and now adorns nearly 50 percent of the state's license plates. In 2001, Utah Governor [[Mike Leavitt]] approved a new state slogan, "Utah! Where Ideas Connect", which lasted until March 10, 2006, when the Utah Travel Council and the office of [[Jon Huntsman Jr.|Governor Jon Huntsman]] announced that "Life Elevated" would be the new state slogan.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.visitutah.com/ | title = Visit Utah |website= Office of Tourism | access-date = November 7, 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151107011407/http://www.visitutah.com/ | archive-date = November 7, 2015 | url-status = live }}</ref>

===Mining===

[[File:BinghamCanyon.jpg|thumb|Mining has been a large industry in Utah since it was first settled. The [[Bingham Canyon Mine]] in Salt Lake County is one of the largest open pit mines in the world.]]

Beginning in the late 19th century with the state's mining boom (including the [[Bingham Canyon Mine]], among the world's largest open pit mines), companies attracted large numbers of [[immigrants]] with job opportunities. Since the days of the Utah Territory mining has played a major role in Utah's economy. Historical mining towns include [[Mercur, Utah|Mercur]] in Tooele County, [[Silver Reef, Utah|Silver Reef]] in Washington County, [[Eureka, Utah|Eureka]] in Juab County, [[Park City, Utah|Park City]] in Summit County and numerous coal mining camps throughout Carbon County such as Castle Gate, Spring Canyon, and Hiawatha.<ref name="Highlights">Utah Department of Community and Culture, Mining Heritage Alliance, [http://history.utah.gov/mining_heritage_alliance/highlights.html Highlights] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117095118/http://history.utah.gov/mining_heritage_alliance/highlights.html |date=January 17, 2013 }} http://finance.utah.gov/highlights.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117095118/http://history.utah.gov/mining_heritage_alliance/highlights.html |date=January 17, 2013 }}     as found at Utah.gov http://finance.utah.gov/highlights.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117095118/http://history.utah.gov/mining_heritage_alliance/highlights.html |date=January 17, 2013 }}</ref>

These settlements were characteristic of the boom and bust cycle that dominated mining towns of the American West. Park City, Utah, and Alta, Utah were boom towns in the early twentieth century. Rich silver mines in the mountains adjacent to the towns led to many people flocking to the towns in search of wealth. During the early part of the [[Cold War]] era, uranium was mined in eastern Utah. Today mining activity still plays a major role in the state's economy. Minerals mined in Utah include copper, gold, silver, molybdenum, zinc, lead, and beryllium. Fossil fuels including coal, petroleum, and natural gas continue to play a large role in Utah's economy, especially in the eastern part of the state in counties such as Carbon, Emery, Grand, and Uintah.<ref name="Highlights"/>

====Incidents====

In 2007, nine people were killed at the [[Crandall Canyon Mine]] collapse.

On March 22, 2013, one miner died and another was injured after they became trapped in a cave-in at a part of the [[Castle Valley, Utah|Castle Valley Mining Complex]], about {{convert|16|km}} west of the small mining town of [[Huntington, Utah|Huntington]] in [[Emery County, Utah|Emery County]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Officials: Miner dead, 1 rescued in Utah cave-in|date=March 22, 2013 |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/officials-miner-dead-1-rescued-in-utah-cave-in/|publisher=CBS News|access-date=March 23, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130323093833/http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-201_162-57575938/officials-miner-dead-1-rescued-in-utah-cave-in/|archive-date=March 23, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

As of 2024, [[J. Bracken Lee]] (1949-1957) was the most recent of three Governors of Utah who was not a member of [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the other two being [[Simon Bamberger]] (1917–1921) and [[George Dern]] (1925–1933).

The [[Utah State Legislature]] consists of a [[Utah State Senate|Senate]] and a [[Utah State House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. State senators serve four-year terms and representatives two-year terms. The Utah Legislature meets each year in January for an annual 45-day session.

The [[Utah Supreme Court]] is the court of last resort in Utah. It consists of five justices, who are appointed by the governor, and then subject to retention election. The [[Utah Court of Appeals]] handles cases from the trial courts.<ref>Utah State Courts, [http://www.utcourts.gov/courts/appell/ Utah Court of Appeals] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122050432/http://www.utcourts.gov/courts/appell/ |date=January 22, 2009 }}</ref> Trial level courts are the district courts and justice courts. All justices and judges, like those on the Utah Supreme Court, are subject to [[retention election]] after appointment.

===Women's rights===

{{Further|Women's suffrage in Utah}}

Utah granted full [[suffrage|voting rights]] to women in 1870, 26 years before becoming a state. Among all U.S. states, only Wyoming granted [[Women's suffrage|suffrage to women]] earlier.<ref>National Constitution Center, [http://www.constitutioncenter.org/timeline/html/cw08_12159.html Map: States grant women the right to vote] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070814035603/http://www.constitutioncenter.org/timeline/html/cw08_12159.html |date=August 14, 2007 }}</ref> However, in 1887 the initial [[Edmunds-Tucker Act]] was passed by Congress to curtail Mormon influence in the territorial government. One of the provisions of the Act was the repeal of women's suffrage; full suffrage was not returned until Utah was admitted to the Union in 1896.

===Alcohol, tobacco, and gambling laws===

{{see also|List of breweries, wineries, and distilleries in Utah|List of alcohol laws of the United States}}

Utah's laws regarding [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]], tobacco and gambling are strict. Utah is an [[alcoholic beverage control state]]. The [[Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control]] regulates the sale of alcohol; wine and spirituous liquors may be purchased only at state liquor stores, and local laws may prohibit the sale of beer and other alcoholic beverages on Sundays. The state bans the sale of fruity alcoholic drinks at grocery stores and convenience stores. The law states that such drinks must now have new state-approved labels on the front of the products that contain capitalized letters in bold type telling consumers the drinks contain alcohol and at what percentage. Utah is the only state that imposes a maximum [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC) of 0.05% for drivers, as opposed to the 0.08% limit in other states.<ref name="LLU Institute for Health Policy Leadership 2021">{{cite web | title=Utah's New Law Against Drinking and Driving | website=LLU Institute for Health Policy Leadership | date=2021-02-25 | url=https://ihpl.llu.edu/blog/utah-s-new-law-against-drinking-and-driving | access-date=2021-04-03}}</ref> The Utah Indoor Clean Air Act is a statewide [[smoking ban]] that prohibits it in many public places.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.le.utah.gov/UtahCode/section.jsp?code=26-38 |title=Utah State Legislature |publisher=Le.utah.gov |access-date=December 31, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209182105/http://www.le.utah.gov/UtahCode/section.jsp?code=26-38 |archive-date=February 9, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Utah and Hawaii are the only two states in the United States to outlaw all forms of gambling.

In the late 19th century, the federal government took issue with polygamy in the LDS Church. The LDS Church discontinued plural marriage in 1890, and in 1896 Utah gained admission to the Union. Many new people settled in the area soon after the Mormon pioneers.

He lost re-election to [[Burgess Owens]], a Republican, in 2020. After Jon Huntsman Jr. resigned to serve as U.S. Ambassador to China in 2009, [[Gary Herbert]] was sworn in as governor on August 11, 2009. Herbert was elected to serve out the remainder of the term in a special election in 2010, defeating Democratic nominee Salt Lake County Mayor Peter Corroon with 64% of the vote. He won election to a full four-year term in 2012, defeating the Democrat Peter Cooke with 68% of the vote.

[[David Magleby]], dean of Social and Behavioral Sciences at [[Brigham Young University]], a lifelong Democrat and a political analyst, asserts that the Republican Party has more conservative positions than the LDS Church.
