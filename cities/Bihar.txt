== Etymology ==
The name ''Bihar'' is derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[vihāra]]'' ([[Devanagari]]: विहार), meaning "abode" and usually referred to a Buddhist monastery. The region roughly encompassing the present state had many Buddhist vihāras, the abodes of Buddhist monks in the ancient and medieval periods.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Kumar |first1=Swargesh |title=Bihar Tourism: Retrospect and Prospect |date=2012 |publisher=Concept Publishing Company |isbn=9788180697999 |page=101 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dSZ987-0Fb8C&dq=bihar+etymology&pg=PA101 |quote=The name Bihar is derived from the Sanskrit word Vihār (Devanagari) which means "abode".}}</ref>

Based on the information found in texts pertaining to Jainism and Buddhism, Vajji was established as a republic by the sixth century BCE, before the birth of [[Gautama Buddha]] in 563&nbsp;BCE, making it the first known republic in India.

The [[Haryanka dynasty]], founded in 684&nbsp;BCE, ruled Magadha from the city of Rajgriha (modern [[Rajgir]]). The two well-known kings from this dynasty were [[Bimbisara]] and his son [[Ajatashatru]], who imprisoned his father to ascend the throne. Ajatashatru founded the city of [[Pataliputra]] which later became the capital of Magadha. He declared war and conquered the [[Vajjika League]]. The Haryanka dynasty was followed by the [[Shishunaga dynasty]]. Later, the [[Nanda dynasty]] ruled a vast tract stretching from [[Punjab]] to [[Odisha]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bronkhorst |first1=Johannes |title=Buddhism in the Shadow of Brahmanism |date=14 February 2011 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-20140-8 |page=12 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BaX58-E5-3MC&pg=PA12}}</ref>

The Nanda dynasty was replaced by the [[Maurya Empire]], India's first empire. The Maurya Empire and the religion of [[Buddhism]] arose in the region that now makes up modern Bihar. The Mauryan Empire, which originated from Magadha in 325&nbsp;BCE, was founded by [[Chandragupta Maurya]], who was born in Magadha. It had its capital at [[Pataliputra]] (modern [[Patna]]).

Buddhism in Magadha declined due to the invasion of [[Muhammad bin Bakhtiyar Khalji]], during which many of the [[viharas]] were destroyed along with the universities of [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramashila]].

=== Colonial era ===
After the [[Battle of Buxar]] (1764), the [[British East India Company]] obtained the diwani rights (rights to administer and collect tax revenue) for Bihar, [[Bengal]], and [[Odisha]]. The rich resources of fertile land, water, and skilled labour had attracted the foreign imperialists, particularly the Dutch and British, in the 18th century. A number of agriculture-based industries had been started in Bihar by foreign entrepreneurs.<ref>{{cite web |title=Early Agro based Industries |url=http://www.bihargatha.in/early-agriculture-based-enterprenureships |date=2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910142241/http://www.bihargatha.in/early-agriculture-based-enterprenureships |archive-date=10 September 2011 |website=Bihargatha |access-date=13 August 2015}}</ref> Bihar remained a part of the [[Bengal Presidency]] of [[British India]] until 1912, when [[Bihar and Orissa]] were carved out as separate provinces.

In the northern and central regions of Bihar, the [[All India Kisan Sabha|Kisan Sabha]] (peasant movement) was an important consequence of the independence movement. It began in 1929 under the leadership of [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] who formed the [[Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha]] (BPKS), to mobilise peasant grievances against the [[zamindari]] attacks on their occupancy rights. The movement intensified and spread from Bihar across the rest of India, culminating in the formation of the [[All India Kisan Sabha]] (AIKS) at the [[Lucknow]] session of the [[Indian National Congress]] in April&nbsp;1936, where Saraswati was elected as its first president.<ref>{{cite book |first=Śekhara |last=Bandyopādhyāya |title=From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India | publisher=Orient Longman |year=2004 |isbn=978-81-250-2596-2 |pages=406–407}}</ref>

Following independence, [[Bihari people|Bihari]] migrant workers have faced violence and prejudice in many parts of India, such as [[Maharashtra]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], and [[Assam]].<ref>{{cite news| author=Kumod Verma| date=14 February 2008| title=Scared Biharis arrive from Mumbai| url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/Scared-Biharis-arrive-from-Mumbai/articleshow/2781266.cms| access-date=14 February 2008| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022092951/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2008-02-14/patna/27756096_1_mumbai-bound-trains-mns-activists-passenger-trains| archive-date=22 October 2012| url-status=live| work=[[The Times of India]]| df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last=Hussain | first=Wasbir | author-link=Wasbir Hussain | date=11 August 2007 | title=30 Killed in Northeast Violence in India | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/11/AR2007081100464_pf.html | newspaper=Washington Post | access-date=25 February 2006 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121107005651/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/11/AR2007081100464_pf.html | archive-date=7 November 2012 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Decades following the independence in 1947 were full of violent conflicts between the landless section of Bihari society and the landed elite who controlled the government at various level. This was an outcome of the failed land reform drive and improper implementation of the land ceiling laws that were passed by [[Indian National Congress]] government in the 1950s. Landed castes like [[Rajput]] and [[Bhumihar]] became suspicious of the land reforms and used their influence in government to hinder the efforts of the land redistribution programme, which may have alleviated the huge caste based income inequalities. Unscrupulous tactics such as [[absentee landlordism]] neutralised the reforms which was architected by [[Krishna Ballabh Sahay]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eDRPDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA198|title=Politics And Governance In Indian States Bihar, West Bengal And Tripura|author1=Subrata Kumar Mitra|author2=Harihar Bhattacharyya|publisher=World Scientific|year=2018|isbn=978-9813208247|pages=198–200|access-date=10 June 2022|archive-date=9 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220609193754/https://books.google.co.in/books?id=eDRPDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA198&dq=|url-status=live}}Zamindari abolition was not immediately followed by land reforms measures, as Bhumihars and Rajputs, the landowning classes dominant in the Congress, became suspicious. K B Sahay, the main architect of the land reforms, had to restrain the efforts.This worsened the conditions of non-occupancy tenants. Fixation of ceiling and distribution of surplus land could not be imple mented effectively as these laws had a number of conciliatory provisions and the landowners could keep the land under various other categories in excess of the stipulated area.
Thus, the illegal distribution of land, absentee landlordism and the system of sharecropping or bataidari on unfavorable terms, lack of employment in other sectors, absence of modernization of agri culture, lack of adequate irrigation facilities and power etc. led to brewing of discontent to an unimaginable extent. This provided the naxals a fertile ground for fighting on behalf of the poor peasants and organizing them.</ref>

In the [[Zamindari]] areas of Bihar, such as [[Bhojpur district, India|Bhojpur district]], the [[Dalit]]s were also subjected to frequent humiliation and practice of [[begar]] existed. This led to first spark of mass scale [[naxalism]] to grew up in the plains of Bhojpur. This armed struggle was led initially by [[Jagdish Mahto|Master Jagdish Mahto]], a school teacher turned naxalite.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sinha|first=Arun|title=Class War in Bhojpur: I|journal=[[Economic and Political Weekly]]|volume= 13|issue= 1|year=1978|pages=10–11|jstor=4366262|quote=He tried to make the poor aware of their condition through a newspaper, but was balked by lack of money and response. He tried democratic protest through the torchlight procession but nothing came of it.Ever since he joined the school, the Master had been going to Ekwari, his village, on leave. As he suffered from chronic dysentery, nobody in the school suspected how the science teacher was using his leave. Towards the end of 1969, his absences on leave became more frequent. That year mysterious' incidents started occurring at Ekwari. Some day a haystack in a  landlord's barn would be set on fire, another day someone's crops would be found cut. Reports of these incidents had started reaching Arrah. Soon after the Master applied for three months' leave and never returned.}}</ref> Soon, the struggle spread into other parts of Bihar, where the landlords and agricultural labourers locked horns against each other. Between 1950 and 2000, several massacres took place. In Bihar, unlike the other parts of India, the naxalism took the form of caste conflict as the landed section of society belonged primarily to [[Forward Castes]] and a section of [[Upper Backward Castes]], on the other hand, the landless were the people belonging to [[Schedule Castes]] and a section of [[Other Backward Castes]]. Formation of caste based private armies called ''Senas''' took place in response to violent activities of the naxalites.

Meanwhile, the 1960s saw the rise of political instability in the state with dwindling power of Indian National Congress and rise of parties like [[Samyukta Socialist Party]].

Under the [[Constitution of India]], the Governor is the head of the government of Bihar, and is appointed by the [[President of India]]. The [[Chief minister]] is the executive head of the government who, with its cabinet ministers, makes all important policy decisions. The political party or coalition of political parties having a majority in the Bihar Legislative Assembly forms the government.

The Chief Secretary is the head of the bureaucracy of the state, under whom a hierarchy of officials is drawn from the [[Indian Administrative Service]], [[Indian Police Service]], [[Indian Forest Service]], and different wings of the state civil services. The [[judiciary]] is headed by the Chief Justice of the High Court. Bihar has a [[Patna High Court|high court]] in Patna, which has been functioning since 1916.

[[File:The Chief Minister of Bihar, Shri Nitish Kumar discussing with the Prime Minister, Dr. Manmohan Singh about the relief operations on flood-affected areas, in Bihar, August 28, 2008.jpg|thumb|Nitish Kumar (left) with Lalu Prasad Yadav (right) discussing with former Prime Minister, [[Manmohan Singh]] (centre) about flood relief operation in Bihar.]]
The politics of Bihar have been based on [[caste]] since the onset of [[Indian Independence Act 1947|Indian independence]]. The important castes with political presence and influence in Bihar includes: [[Yadav]], [[Koeri]], [[Kurmi]], [[Rajput]], [[Bhumihar]], and [[Brahmin]]. Before 1990, politics was dominated by [[Forward Castes]]– Brahmin, Rajput, Bhumihar, and [[Kayastha]]. The numerous [[Other Backward Class]] group was only given a token representation in the government. This over representation of upper castes was due to their dominance in the [[Indian National Congress]], which dominated the politics of the state for three decades after the independence of India. According to political scientist Sanjay Kumar: "Using their dominant role in state's government, in the period before 1990, the Forward Castes deliberately subverted the 'land reforms', which could have helped Backward Castes and the [[Scheduled Castes]]". The [[Upper Backward Castes|upper backwards]] relied on the political parties of [[Lok Dal]] and later [[Janata Dal]] for increasing their political representation. The year of 1989-90 saw the implementation of [[Mandal Commission]]'s recommendation by [[Vishwanath Pratap Singh]]'s government, which reserved 27% per cent seats in government jobs and educational institutions for the members of [[Other Backward Class]]. This event mobilised them against the "politics of religion" of the [[Bhartiya Janata Party]], which was backed by the [[Forward Castes]]. Important figures such as [[Lalu Prasad Yadav]] and [[Nitish Kumar]] took a leading role in this mobilisation, and by 1990, the upper backwards– [[Koeri]], [[Kurmi]], [[Yadav]] became the new political elites of the state.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IVxODwAAQBAJ&pg=PT27|title=	Post-Mandal Politics in Bihar: Changing Electoral Patterns|author=	Sanjay Kumar|publisher=SAGE Publishing India|year=2018|
isbn=978-9352805860|pages=27–28|access-date=22 January 2021}}</ref>

Historically, a caste troika consisting the three communities, [[Kushwaha]], [[Kurmi]] and [[Yadav]] also led an anti-upper caste agitation in the state of Bihar, pushing them to the prominence in the state's politics.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Banerjee |first1=Anindya |last2=Thirumalai |first2=Nitya |date=29 January 2024 |url=https://www.news18.com/politics/obc-vs-obc-rising-star-samrat-chaudhary-may-be-bjps-answer-to-nitish-kumar-in-2025-bihar-elections-8758105.html |title=OBC vs OBC: Rising Star Samrat Chaudhary May Be BJP's Answer to Nitish Kumar in 2025 Bihar Elections |work=News18 |access-date=6 July 2024}}</ref>

However, the tipping point of this Backward Caste unity came in [[1995 Bihar Legislative Assembly election]], when the dominant OBC castes, who were at the forefront in the collective struggle against the Forward Castes, were divided into two rival political camps. While one of these camps was led by Yadavs under [[Janata Dal]], the other camp was led by Koeri and Kurmis, who assembled under the [[Samata Party]]. According to Sanjay Kumar, this was the election in which the caste divide in the state was most evident not between the Forward and Backward Castes, but rather between two groups of Backward Castes itself. It was this election from which the Forward Castes felt completely marginalised in Bihar's electoral politics and from then onwards, no longer held any significant role in the state's politics.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Sanjay|title="New Phase in Backward Caste Politics in Bihar: Janata Dal on the Decline."|journal =Economic and Political Weekly| volume=34|issue=34/35|year =1999|pages= 2472–80|jstor=4408343|quote=  The polarisation was not on the lines of the upper and the backward caste divide, but it was around the two axes of backward caste politics. Laloo Yadav after comp- leting his term in office even with a minority government went to polls in a situation where an anti-incumbency wave was sweeping the country. The consolidated backward castes had fragmented into two blocs, one represented by the yadavs in the form of the Janata Dal and the other represented by the kurmis and koeris represented by the Samata Party. For the first time, the upper-castes felt totally marginalised in the state's politics since the support base of their natural ally, the Congress, has been completely eroded. while the BJP was unable to make much inroads among the voters.}}</ref>

By 2004, ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine said that "Bihar [had] become a byword for the worst of India, of widespread and inescapable poverty, of corrupt politicians indistinguishable from mafia-dons they patronise, caste-ridden social order that has retained the worst feudal cruelties".<ref>{{cite news |title=Bihar a byword for worst of India: The Economist |url=http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=28789 |date=25 February 2004 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010042826/http://www.expressindia.com/news/fullstory.php?newsid=28789 |archive-date=10 October 2012 |newspaper=The Indian Express |agency=Press Trust of India |access-date=9 September 2019}}</ref> In 2005, the [[World Bank]] believed that issues faced by the state were "enormous" because of "persistent poverty, complex social stratification, unsatisfactory infrastructure and weak governance".<ref name="wpbihar">{{cite web |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/624671468035374716/pdf/328190IN0Bihar1reportl1June200501PUBLIC1.pdf |title=Bihar – Towards a Development Strategy |publisher=World Bank |year=2005 |location=Washington, DC |access-date=22 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190322000944/http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/624671468035374716/pdf/328190IN0Bihar1reportl1June200501PUBLIC1.pdf |archive-date=22 March 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[Nitish Kumar]] has been chief minister of Bihar for 13&nbsp;years between 2005 and 2020.

{{See also|Mithila painting|Patna Qualam|Manjusha Painting}}[[File:Sharmila Sharma et Rajendra Kumar Gangani 2.jpg|300px|thumb|[[Kathak]] classical dance form, from Bhojpur region]]There are several traditional styles of painting practised in Bihar. One is [[Mithila painting]], a style used in the [[Mithila (region)|Mithila region]] of Bihar. Traditionally, this form was practised mainly by women, passed down generation to generation. Painting was usually done on walls during festivals, religious events, births, marriages, and other cultural milestones.<ref name="Carolyn Brown Heinz 2006, pp. 5-33">Carolyn Brown Heinz, 2006, "Documenting the Image in Mithila Art", Visual Anthropology Review, Vol. 22, Issue 2, pp. 5–33</ref> It was traditionally done on the plastered walls of mud huts, and is also done on cloth, handmade paper and canvas. Famous Mithila painters include Smt Bharti Dayal, [[Mahasundari Devi]], the late [[Ganga Devi (painter)|Ganga Devi]], and Sita Devi.

Mithila painting is also called [[Madhubani art]]. It mostly depicts human beings and their association with nature.  Common scenes illustrate deities and [[Saraswati]] from ancient epics, celestial objects, and religious plants like [[Tulsi]], and scenes from the royal court and social events. Generally, no space is left empty.<ref name="Carolyn Brown Heinz 2006, pp. 5-33" />

Bhojpuri painting is a folk painting style that has flourished in the [[Bhojpuri region]] of Bihar thousands of years ago. This painting style is a type of wall painting primarily done on temple walls or on walls of the rooms of newly married couples and the main motifs are that of Lord Shiva and Goddess Parvati. Although in recent times motifs of natural objects and life and struggles of village people are also depicted to make the painting more acceptable among the common people and bring the style close to reality.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bhojpuri Painting |url=https://www.artsofindia.in/arts-of-india-blog/post/indian-arts-and-crafts/bhojpuri-painting.html |access-date=8 April 2023 |website=www.artsofindia.in |language=en |archive-date=7 April 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230407165621/https://www.artsofindia.in/arts-of-india-blog/post/indian-arts-and-crafts/bhojpuri-painting.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Patna School of Painting]] (''Patna Kalam''), sometimes called "Company Painting", flourished in Bihar during the early 18th to mid-20th centuries. It was an offshoot of the [[Mughal painting|Mughal]] Miniature School of Painting. Those who practised this art form were descendants of Hindu artisans of Mughal painting. Facing persecution from the Mughal Emperor, [[Aurangzeb]], these artisans found refuge, via [[Murshidabad]], in [[Patna]] during the late 18th century. Their art shared the characteristics of the Mughal painters, expanded subject matter from court scenes to [[bazaar]] scenes, daily life and ceremonies. They used [[watercolour]]s on paper and on [[mica]]. This school of painting formed the basis for the formation of the [[College of Arts and Crafts Patna|Patna Art School]] under the leadership of Shri Radha Mohan. The school is an important centre of the [[fine arts]] in Bihar.

{{See also|Music of Bihar}}
Bihar has produced musicians like [[Bharat Ratna]] and [[Ustad Bismillah Khan]], and [[dhrupad]] singers like the Malliks ([[Darbhanga Gharana]]) and the Mishras ([[Bettiah]] Gharana), along with poets like [[Vidyapati]] Thakur who contributed to the genre of [[Maithili music]]. The classical music in Bihar is a form of [[Hindustani classical music]].{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

[[Gaya (India)|Gaya]] is another centre of classical music, particularly of the [[Tappa]] and [[Thumri]] varieties. [[Pandit]] Govardhan Mishra–son of the Ram Prasad Mishra, himself an accomplished singer– is perhaps the finest living exponent of Tappa singing in India, according to [[Padma Shri]] Gajendra Narayan Singh, founding secretary of the [[Sangeet Natak Academi]] of Bihar{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}.

Gajendra Narayan Singh also writes, in his memoir, that Champanagar, [[Banaili]], was another major centre of classical music. [[Rajkumar Shyamanand Sinha]] of Champanagar, Banaili princely state, was a great patron of music and was himself a renowned figure in the world of classical vocal music in Bihar in his time.<ref name=Singh2008>{{cite book |last=Singh |first=Gajendra Narayan |title=Surile Logon Ki Sangat |year=2008 |orig-year=2002 |location=New Delhi |publisher=Kanishka Publishers & Distributors |isbn=9788184570724}}</ref> Singh, on the subject of Indian classical music in a separate book of his, wrote that "Kumar Shyamanand Singh of Banaili estate had such expertise in singing that many great singers including [[Kesarbai Kerkar]] acknowledged his ability.

During the 19th century, many Biharis emigrated as indentured labourers to the [[West Indies]], [[Fiji]], and [[Mauritius]]. During this time many sorrowful plays and songs called ''birha'' became popular in the [[Bhojpuri region|Bhojpur region]], as ''Bhojpuri Birha''. Dramas incorporating this theme continue to be popular in the theatres of [[Patna]].<ref name=Jugnu2013>{{cite AV media |last=Jugnu |first=Haidar Ali |title=Sati Sulochana – Bhojpuri Birha By Haidar Ali- Jugnu |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3vGrihYfX4 |publisher=hamaarbhojpuri |website=[[YouTube]] |access-date=25 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522222404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3vGrihYfX4 |archive-date=22 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>{{better source needed|date=April 2016}}

Bihar has a robust [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]]-language film industry. There is also a smaller production of [[Magadhi]]-, [[Maithili language|Maithili]] language films. The first film with Bhojpuri dialogue was ''[[Ganga Jamuna]]'', released in 1961.<ref>[[Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Charaihbo]] – [https://us.imdb.com/title/tt0054910/ First Bhojpuri language film] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315165512/http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0054910/|date=15 March 2007}}</ref>

The history of films entirely in Bhojpuri begins in 1962 with the well-received film ''[[Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo]]'' ("Mother Ganges, I will offer you a yellow sari"), which was directed by Kundan Kumar.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233774/|title=Ganga Maiyya Tohe Piyari Chadhaibo (1962)|work=IMDb|access-date=27 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130920030553/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0233774/|archive-date=20 September 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>
1963's ''[[Lagi nahin chute ram]]'' was the all-time hit Bhojpuri film, and had higher attendance than ''[[Mughal-e-Azam]]'' in the eastern and northern regions of India. [[Bollywood]]'s ''[[Nadiya Ke Paar (1982 film)|Nadiya Ke Paar]]'' is another well-known Bhojpuri-language movie. Films such as ''[[Bidesiya (film)|Bidesiya]]'' ("Foreigner", 1963, directed by S. N. Tripathi) and ''[[Ganga (1965 film)|Ganga]]'' ("Ganges", 1965, directed by Kundan Kumar) were profitable and popular, but in general Bhojpuri films were not commonly produced in the 1960s and 1970s.

In the 1980s, enough Bhojpuri films were produced to support a dedicated industry. Films such as ''Mai'' ("Mom", 1989, directed by Rajkumar Sharma) and ''Hamar Bhauji'' ("My Brother's Wife", 1983, directed by Kalpataru) had success at the box office. However, this trend faded during the 1990s.<ref>Tripathy, Ratnakar (2007) 'Bhojpuri Cinema', South Asian Popular Culture, 5:2, 145–165</ref>

In 2001, Bhojpuri films regained popularity with ''Saiyyan Hamar'' ("My Sweetheart", directed by Mohan Prasad), which raised actor [[Ravi Kishan]] to prominence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060414/asp/etc/story_6075200.asp |title=For my female audiences, I'll wear a really flimsy dhoti |work=The Telegraph |location=Kolkota, India |date=14 April 2006 |access-date=15 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021111613/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1060414/asp/etc/story_6075200.asp |archive-date=21 October 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Several other commercially successful films followed, including ''Panditji Batai Na Biyah Kab Hoi'' ("Priest, tell me when I will marry", 2005, directed by Mohan Prasad) and ''Sasura Bada Paisa Wala'' ("My father-in-law, the rich guy", 2005).

[[Chhath Puja]] are done in various cities, towns, and villages throughout Bihar. All of Bihar involves itself in devotion to Chhath Puja. The city is decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful ghats are set up, where effigies of the goddess Chhath Maiya and her brother God Surya are displayed and worshipped at both sunset and sunrise. People of all religious backgrounds go to the bank of any river or near by a pond or lake in order to give arghya to the Sun. They carry fruits and [[thekua]]a along with them in soop and daura (a bowl-like structure made of bamboo) for their worship activities. Nowadays, these traditions have spread to multiple countries worldwide wherever Bihari community is present.

[[Durga Puja]] is also the biggest, most popular and widely celebrated festival in Bihar.<ref name=durgapuja>{{cite web |url = http://bstdc.bihar.gov.in/festivals.htm |title = Durga Pooja |work = Festivals of Bihar |publisher = Bihar State Tourism Development Corporation |access-date = 7 October 2022 |archive-date = 29 November 2022 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20221129215117/http://bstdc.bihar.gov.in/festivals.htm |url-status = live }}</ref> The ten-day-long colourful Hindu festival includes intense celebration across the state. [[Pandal]]s are erected in various cities, towns, and villages throughout Bihar. The cities of Bihar are transformed during Durga Puja. Urban areas are decked up in lighting decorations and thousands of colourful pandals are set up where effigies of the goddess Durga and her four children are displayed and worshipped. The idols of the goddess are brought in from [[Kumortuli]], where idol-makers work throughout the year fashioning clay models of the goddess. Since independence in 1947, Durga Puja has slowly changed into more of a glamorous carnival than that of a religious festival. Today people of diverse religious and ethnic backgrounds partake in the festivities. On [[Vijayadashami]], the last day of the festival, the effigies are paraded through the streets with riotous pageantry before being immersed into the rivers.

The centre aims to attract the youth of the state to improve their technical, professional, and soft skills, to meet the current requirements of the industrial job market.<ref>{{cite web|date=2008|title=Bihar Knowledge Center|url=http://www.biharonline.gov.in/Site/BKC/Default.aspx|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090428045325/http://www.biharonline.gov.in/Site/BKC/Default.aspx|archive-date=28 April 2009|access-date=3 August 2016}}</ref> The National Employability Report of Engineering Graduates, 2014,<ref>{{cite web|title=National Employability Report – Engineers, Annual Report 2014|url=http://www.aspiringminds.com/sites/default/files/National%20Employability%20Report%20-%20Engineers,%20Annual%20Report%202014.pdf|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012093454/http://www.aspiringminds.com/sites/default/files/National%20Employability%20Report%20-%20Engineers,%20Annual%20Report%202014.pdf|archive-date=12 October 2016|access-date=2 September 2016|website=www.aspiringminds.com|page=22}}</ref> puts graduates from Bihar in the top 25 per cent of the country, and rates Bihar as one of the three top states at producing engineering graduates in terms of quality and employability.<ref>{{cite news|title=Delhi, Bihar produce top engineers in India: Report|work=The Times Of India|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Delhi-Bihar-produce-top-engineers-in-India-Report/articleshow/29664924.cms|url-status=live|access-date=1 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201151525/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Delhi-Bihar-produce-top-engineers-in-India-Report/articleshow/29664924.cms|archive-date=1 February 2014}}</ref>
