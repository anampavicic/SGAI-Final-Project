'''Perak''' ({{IPA-may|peraʔ}}; [[Perak Malay]]: ''Peghok''; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]: {{Script/Arabic|ڤيراق}}) is a [[States and federal territories of Malaysia|state]] of [[Malaysia]] on the west coast of the [[Malay Peninsula]]. Perak has land borders with the Malaysian states of [[Kedah]] to the north, [[Penang]] to the northwest, [[Kelantan]] and [[Pahang]] to the east, and [[Selangor]] to the south. [[Thailand]]'s [[Yala Province|Yala]] and [[Narathiwat Province|Narathiwat]] provinces both lie to the northeast. Perak's capital city, [[Ipoh]], was known historically for its [[tin]]-mining activities until the price of the metal dropped, severely affecting the state's economy. The royal capital remains [[Kuala Kangsar]], where the palace of the [[Sultan of Perak]] is located. As of 2018, the state's population was 2,500,000. Perak has [[biodiversity|diverse]] [[tropical rainforests]] and an [[equatorial climate]]. The state's main [[mountain ranges]] are composed of the [[Titiwangsa Mountains|Titiwangsa]], [[Bintang Mountains|Bintang]] and [[Keledang Range|Keledang Ranges]], where all of them are part of the larger [[Tenasserim Hills]] system that connects [[Myanmar]], [[Thailand]] and Malaysia.

The discovery of an ancient skeleton in Perak revealed missing information on the migration of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' from mainland [[Asia]] through [[Southeast Asia]] to the [[Australia (continent)|Australian]] continent. Known as Perak Man, the skeleton is dated at around 10,000 years old. An early [[Hinduism|Hindu]] or [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] kingdom, followed by several other minor kingdoms, existed before the [[Islam in Southeast Asia|arrival of Islam]]. By 1528, a Muslim sultanate began to emerge in Perak, out of the remnants of the [[Malaccan Sultanate]]. Although able to resist Siamese occupation for more than two hundred years, the sultanate was partly controlled by the [[Sumatra]]-based [[Aceh Sultanate]]. This was particularly the case after the Aceh lineage took over the royal succession. With the arrival of the [[Dutch East India Company]] (VOC), and the VOC's increasing conflicts with Aceh, Perak began to distance itself from Acehnese control. The presence of the English [[East India Company]] (EIC) in the nearby [[Straits Settlements]] of Penang provided additional protection for the state, with further Siamese attempts to conquer Perak thwarted by British expeditionary forces.

The [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824]] was signed to prevent further conflict between the British and the Dutch. It enabled the British to expand their control in the Malay Peninsula without interference from other foreign powers. The [[Pangkor Treaty of 1874|1874 Pangkor Treaty]] provided for direct British intervention, with Perak appointing a British [[Resident (title)|Resident]]. Following Perak's subsequent absorption into the [[Federated Malay States]] (FMS), the British reformed administration of the sultanate through a new style of government, actively promoting a [[market-driven economy]] and maintaining law and order while combatting the [[slavery]] widely practised across Perak at the time. The three-year [[Japanese occupation of Malaya|Japanese occupation]] in [[World War II]] halted further progress. After the war, Perak became part of the temporary [[Malayan Union]], before being absorbed into the [[Federation of Malaya]]. It gained full independence through the Federation, which subsequently became Malaysia on 16 September 1963.

Perak is ethnically, culturally and linguistically diverse. The state is known for several traditional dances: ''bubu'', ''dabus'', and ''labu sayong'', the latter name also referring to Perak's unique traditional [[pottery]]. The head of state is the [[Sultan of Perak]], and the head of government is the ''[[List of Menteris Besar of Perak|Menteri Besar]]''. Government is closely modelled on the [[Westminster system|Westminster parliamentary system]], with the state administration divided into administrative districts. Islam is the [[state religion]], and other religions may be practised freely. [[Malaysian language|Malay]] and [[English language|English]] are recognised as the official languages of Perak. The economy is mainly based on [[Tertiary sector of the economy|services]] and [[Secondary sector of the economy|manufacturing]].

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{main|List of districts in Malaysia|List of local governments in Malaysia}}
Perak is divided into 12 [[Districts of Malaysia|districts]] (''daerah''), 81 ''[[mukim]]s'', and 15 local governments.<ref name="UPI">{{cite web|url=https://www.mygeoportal.gov.my/sites/default/files/UPI/KOD%20DAN%20NAMA%20SEMPADAN%20PENTADBIRAN%20TANAH_PERAK.pdf|title=Kod Dan Nama Sempadan Pentadbiran Tanah|trans-title=Land Administration Boundary Code And Name|language=ms|publisher=Centre for Geospatial Data Infrastructure, Ministry of Water, Land and Natural Resources of Malaysia|year=2011|access-date=18 October 2019|pages=1–49 [1/55]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018040107/https://www.mygeoportal.gov.my/sites/default/files/UPI/KOD%20DAN%20NAMA%20SEMPADAN%20PENTADBIRAN%20TANAH_PERAK.pdf|archive-date=18 October 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.perak.gov.my/index.php/en/citizen/agency-links/local-authorities|title=Local Authorities|publisher=Government of Perak|access-date=18 October 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191018040522/https://www.perak.gov.my/index.php/en/citizen/agency-links/local-authorities|archive-date=18 October 2019|url-status=dead}}</ref> There are district officers for each district and a village headperson (''ketua kampung'' or ''[[penghulu]]'') for each village in the district. Before the British arrived, Perak was run by a group of relatives and friends of the sultan who held rights to collect taxes and duties.<ref name="transformation of Perak's political and economic structure"/> The British developed a more organised administration following Perak's integration into the [[Federated Malay States]] (FMS). The FMS government created two institutions, the State Council and the Malay Administrative Service (MAS).<ref name="transformation of Perak's political and economic structure"/> The two institutions encouraged direct Malay participation and gave the former ruling class a place in the new administrative structure. Most of the sultan's district chiefs removed from authority at that time were given new positions in the State Council, although their influence was restricted to Malay social matters raised in council business. The sultan and the district chiefs were compensated for their loss of tax revenue with a monthly allowance from the state treasury.<ref name="transformation of Perak's political and economic structure"/>

The role of the local ''penghulus'' changed considerably when they were appointed no longer by the sultan but by the British Resident.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Penghulus in Perak and Selangor: The Rationalization and Decline of a Traditional Malay Office|author=Paul H. Kratoska|journal=Journal of the Malaysian Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society|year=1984|volume=57|issue=2|pages=31–59|jstor=41492983}}</ref> Colonial land policy introduced individual landholding, thereby making land a commodity, and the ''penghulu'' were then involved in matters relating to this property.<ref name="transformation of Perak's political and economic structure"/> The Perak State Council was established in 1875 to assist the British Resident in most administrative matters. It also brought together the Malay chiefs and Chinese leaders (''[[Kapitan Cina]]'') to deal with certain administrative issues relating to Perak's growing Malay and Chinese populations.<ref name="transformation of Perak's political and economic structure"/> The State Council also helped provide education and training to assist Malays in qualifying for government positions. When the post of the FMS Resident was abolished, other European-held administrative posts were gradually occupied by local appointees. As in the rest of Malaysia, local government comes under the purview of state government.<ref name="transformation of Perak's political and economic structure"/>
