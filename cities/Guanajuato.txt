'''Guanajuato''' ({{IPA|es|gwanaˈxwato|-|Guanajuato2.ogg}}), officially the '''Free and Sovereign State of Guanajuato''' ({{langx|es|Estado Libre y Soberano de Guanajuato}}), is one of the 32 states that make up the [[Political divisions of Mexico|Federal Entities]] of [[Mexico]]. It is divided into [[Municipalities of Guanajuato|46 municipalities]] and its capital city is [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]]. 

It is located  in central Mexico and is bordered by the states of [[Jalisco]] to the west, [[Zacatecas]] to the northwest, [[San Luis Potosí]] to the north, [[Querétaro]] to the east, and [[Michoacán]] to the south. It covers an area of {{convert|30,608|km2|abbr=on}}. The state is home to several historically important cities, especially those along the "Bicentennial Route", which retraces the path of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]]'s insurgent army at the beginning of the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. This route begins at [[Dolores Hidalgo]], and passes through the [[Sanctuary of Atotonilco]], [[San Miguel de Allende]], [[Celaya]], and the capital of [[Guanajuato City|Guanajuato]]. Other important cities in the state include [[León, Guanajuato|León]], the state's biggest city, [[Salamanca, Guanajuato|Salamanca]], and [[Irapuato]]. The first town established by the [[Spaniards]] in Guanajuato is [[Acámbaro]] while the first to be named a city is [[Salvatierra, Guanajuato|Salvatierra]].

Guanajuato is between the arid north of the country and the lusher south, and is geographically part of the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]], the [[Mexican Plateau]]. It was initially settled by the Spanish in the 1520s due to mineral deposits found around the city of Guanajuato, but areas such as the [[Bajío]] region also became important for agriculture and livestock. Mining and agriculture were the mainstays of the state's economy, but have since been eclipsed by the [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]]. Guanajuato has particularly seen growth in the [[automotive industry in Mexico|automotive industry]]. The name Guanajuato comes from [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] {{lang|pua|kuanhasï juáta}} (or in older orthography "quanax huato"), which means "frog hill".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110718114725/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/work/templates/enciclo/guanajuato/ "Guanajuato"].

==Geography==
Guanajuato is in the center of Mexico, northwest of Mexico City, bordering Zacatecas, San Luis Potosí, Michoacán, Querétaro, and Jalisco. It is the 20th-largest of Mexico's states, with an area of 30,589&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="mediofisico">{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Medio Físico |year= 2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Geography |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120327111429/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |archive-date= March 27, 2012 }}</ref> It has an average altitude of {{convert|2,015|m|ft|sp=us}} above sea level, with its territory divided among three of Mexico's physical regions, the Sierra Madre Oriental, the Mexican Plateau and the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. The Sierra Madre Oriental in Guanajuato consists of the [[Sierra Gorda]] and the Sierra del Azafrán in the northeast. The Mexican Plateau extends through the center of the state. It is subdivided into various regions parted by low-lying mountain chains such as the Sierra de la Cuatralba and the Sierra de Cubo. The Trans Mexican Volcanic Belt crosses the state in the south and includes the Bajío area, the Altos de Jalisco and the valleys area in the far south. The state is crossed by several mountain ranges with mountains between 2,300 and 3,000 meters high. Mountain ranges average 2,305 meters and flat areas lie at around 1,725 meters above mean sea level. Other important mountain ranges include the Sierra Gorda to the north, the Sierra de Guanajuato in the southeast, the Comanja in the northwest and the Codorniz in the east.<ref name="mediofisico"/>
[[File:Matorral xerófilo de Dolores Hidalgo.jpg|thumb|Altos de Guanajuato]]
The state is divided into five regions, taking into consideration geography and climate: Altos de Guanajuato, La Sierra Central, Bajío, La Sierra Gorda, and Los Valles del Sur.<ref name="r50">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 50</ref> The Altos de Guanajuato, in the north, are a chain of forested mountains interspersed with pastures, small fields and areas with cacti and other desert plants. They begin near the border with San Luis Potosí, and extend south to Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende, and the Querétaro border. This area's altitude varies from 1,800 meters to peaks over 2,900, such as La Giganta and La Sierra del Cubo. The climate is mostly semiarid with a rainy season in the summer, with average temperatures between 15 and 20 °C. Winter lows often reach 0 °C or lower with frosts. Wildlife is found mostly in the most rugged and inaccessible areas and includes deer, coyotes, eagles and rattlesnakes.<ref name="r53">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 53</ref>
[[File:Cerro Culiacán from Jaral del Progreso.jpg|thumb|Cerro Culiacán from Jaral del Progreso]]
La Sierra Gorda is shared between Guanajuato and Querétaro and is considered an important biosphere. This area is the most rugged in the state where most of the natural areas and small villages remain intact due to their inaccessibility.<ref name="r51">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 51</ref> The Sierra Gorda is part of the Sierra Madre Occidental, with extreme variations in its geography and climate. The rugged terrain means that there are a wide number and variety of micro-climates, although average temperatures vary only between 16 and 19 °C. It lowest point is a canyon called Paso de Hormigas in [[Xichú]] at 650 meters above sea level with a very warm climate suitable for tropical fruit. The highest point is Pinal de Zamorano at 3,300 meters, followed by El Picacho de Pueblo Nuevo, El Zorillo and El Cuervo, all above 2,700 meters. The largest changes are seen in arid versus wetter zones, which can often be relatively nearby, with foliage changing from rainforest to pine forest to desert landscapes.<ref name="r6465">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 64–65</ref> In 1997, the federal government declared the Sierra Gorda region in Querétaro a Biosphere Reserve, with Guanajuato's portion added in 2007. On the Guanajuato side, it covers 236,882 hectares over the municipalities of Xichú, [[San Luis de la Paz]], [[Atarjea]], [[Victoria, Guanajuato|Victoria]] and [[Santa Catarina, Guanajuato|Santa Catarina]]. Culturally, the Sierra Gorda region is the far western part of [[La Huasteca]], which extends over parts of Querétaro, San Luis Potosí, [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] and [[Veracruz]].<ref name="r65">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 65</ref>

The Sierra Central is a series of low, gentle mountains in the center of the state that are part of the Sierra Madre Occidental. They cover 12 municipalities: [[Ocampo, Guanajuato|Ocampo]], [[San Felipe, Guanajuato|San Felipe]], León, Silao, Guanajuato, Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende, Irapuato, Salamanca, [[Santa Cruz de Juventino Rosas]], [[Comonfort, Guanajuato|Comonfort]] and [[Apaseo el Grande]]. Wild vegetation runs from tropical rainforest to arid grasslands with cactus, with cypress trees along rivers and other surface water. Wildlife includes raccoons, quail, rabbits, skunks and migratory birds. The land is productive, especially for fruit orchards producing [[guava]]s, [[tejocote]], apples, limes, [[quince]] and more. Desert fruits such as [[cactus pear]]s (tuna), garambullos and [[xoconostle]] are also produced commercially.<ref name="r72">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 72</ref>

The state's best-known geographical region is the Bajío, a relatively low and flat area of between 1,700 and 1,800 meters that surrounds the [[Lerma River]] and its tributaries. Centered in Guanajuato, parts also extend into Querétaro and Jalisco.<ref name="mediofisico"/><ref name="trabajos">{{cite web |url= http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nHistoria92.html |author= Enrique Nalda |title= La arqueología de Guanajuato Trabajos recientes |year= 1993 |work= Arqueología Mexicana |publisher= Copyright Editorial Raíces S.A. de C.V. |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= The archeology of Guanajuato Recent work |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101127040146/http://arqueomex.com/S2N3nHistoria92.html |archive-date= November 27, 2010 }}</ref> This low area is the source of its name, coming from the Spanish word "bajo" or low.<ref name="r76">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 76</ref> The Bajío is filled with rolling hills and interrupted by the occasional chain of low mountains such as the Gavia and the Culiacán.<ref name="mediofisico"/> Before the Spanish arrived, this area was covered in dense forests of [[Quercus agrifolia|holm oak]] and [[mesquite]] trees, but mining's need for wood fuel eventually cleared them. Today, the area is the center of most of the state's agriculture and industry since the terrain allows for highways and large farms, which produce grains, vegetables and fruit.<ref name="r76"/> This farmland is considered some of Mexico's most productive.<ref name="mediofisico"/>
[[File:Lake yuriria.jpg|thumb|left|[[Lake Yuriria]]]]
Los Valles del Sur, also called the Valles Abajeños, are valleys located in southwestern Guanajuato, bordering Michoacán. This area is distinguished by the large number of [[Purépecha language|Purépecha]] place names and covers the municipalities of [[Valle de Santiago]], [[Yuriria]], [[Tarimoro, Guanajuato|Tarimoro]], [[Apaseo el Alto]], [[Moroleón]], [[Uriangato]], [[Santiago Maravatío]], [[Acámbaro]], [[Jerécuaro]], [[Coroneo]] and [[Tarandacuao]]. The area is part of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, with elevations ranging between 1,700 and 2,000 meters. The soil is fertile due to its volcanic base, producing crops such as [[sorghum]], wheat, corn and vegetables. The land also produces building materials such as [[tezontle]] and black sandstone. In the higher elevations, there are forests of pine and holm oak but these have been much reduced by deforestation. The more arid areas have mesquite, [[nopal]] and other desert plants. There are several small lakes, the best known being [[Lake Yuriria]] as well as canyons and cave systems, some of which were used for ceremonial purposes by pre-Hispanic peoples. It is also the home the [[Siete Luminarias]] de Valle de Santiago, a set of seven inactive volcanic craters in the northwest and southwest of the Santiago Valley. The volcano cones rise abruptly out of the ground with craters up to one kilometer across. Locals call the formations "holes" (''hoyos'') and they are named La Alberca, La Cíntora, Estrada, Blanca, Alvarez, Solís and Rincón de Parangueo. La Cíntora and Rincón de Parangueo contain cave paintings and evidence that people once lived in the craters. La Alberca ("The Pool") is a crater lake open to the public for swimming, rowing or boating. The name of Siete Luminarias ("Seven Lanterns") comes from an imagined prehistoric time when the seven were active at once.<ref name="d17">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 17</ref>

The state has about 1,500 bodies of surface water, along with underground aquifers in most parts of the state. Its principal lake is [[Lake Cuitzeo]], on the border with Michoacán and the Yuriria. Several of the Siete Luminarias craters have also developed crater lakes, especially La Joya, Parangueo and Olla de Zìntora.<ref name="mediofisico"/> The most important river in Guanjuato and one of the most important in the country is the Lerma, along with its tributaries [[Guanajuato River]], [[Laja River (Mexico)|La Laja]], and [[Turbio River (Mexico)|Turbio]]. The Lerma river basin covers 81% of the state (center and south); the [[Pánuco River]] basin (north of the state) and Cuitzeo Lake cover the remainder.<ref name="mediofisico"/><ref name="trabajos"/> The Lerma is regulated by various dams in part to control the fact that it ran very high in the rainy season and very low in the dry season.<ref name="trabajos"/> These dams include the Ignacio Allende, la Purísima, Solís, La Gavia, Conejo II and Santa Ifigenia.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

===Climate===
Climates in the state are grouped by precipitation and average temperatures into three major groups. The semiarid climate is characterized by the fact that evaporation often exceeds precipitation. Most of the vegetation in these areas is arid grassland with desert plants such as nopal. These climates cover about 40% of the state, mostly in the north. Semiarid temperate regions are found in the municipalities of San Felipe, [[San Diego de la Unión]], San Luis de la Paz, part of Dolores Hidalgo and [[San José de Iturbide]], where precipitation varies between 400 and 500 mm and the average temperature is between 16 and 18 °C. Semiarid semihot climates can be found north of Dolores Hidalgo, around León and in areas near Celaya. In these municipalities, rainfall averages between 600 and 700 mm and the average annual temperature is between 18 and 20 °C. Temperate climates are judged by the presence of holm oak and pine forest, pine forests and/or pine forests with meadows. Humidity varies in these forest regions. Temperate semi-moist areas are mostly found in the southeast municipalities of Apaseo, Coroneo and Jerécuaro and in the center of the state. Precipitation varies from 600 to 700 mm and the average temperature is between 16 and 18 °C. Temperate and somewhat humid climates have rainfall averages of between 700 and 800 mm, with temperatures between 16 and 18 °C. These can be found in [[Pénjamo]], Coroneo, Jerécuaro and parts of Guanajuato (municipality) and Dolores Hidalgo. Temperate climates with the most humidity are in Santa Rosa and municipality of Guanajuato. These have rainfall averages over 800 mm and average temperatures under 16 °C. Hot and moist climates in the state have temperatures ranging from 18 to 22 °C and are associated with tropical rainforest, with some grassland. These climates are subdivided into two types, one that receives less rainfall with a significant dry season and one that is wetter. The drier type is found in Abasolo, Irapuato, Salamanca and [[Romita]]. In total, these hot and relatively moist climates can be found in about 40% of the state.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

===Ecology===
From the beginning of the colonial period, much of Guanajato's environment suffered greatly from the mining techniques and intensive agriculture the Spanish introduced. The process has been ongoing since then to modern times. Before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquest]], the state was covered in forests, but mining requires large amounts of fuel to process minerals, so they were cut down for fuel and construction projects. Agriculture leached nutrients from the soil, caused erosion, and introduced plants, animals and diseases that have had a large impact.<ref name="r52">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 52</ref>

Today, the state contains 21 protected areas that extend over 63,611 hectares in 26 municipalities. These include [[Sierra de Lobos]], [[Siete Luminarias]], the Silva Dam, Megaparque de Dolores Hidalgo, Cuenca de la Esperanza, Las Fuentes, Peña Alta, Pinal de Zamorano, Parque Metropolitano, La Joya Crater, [[Lake Yuriria]], Las Musas, Culiacán and La Gavia Mountains, [[Sierra de los Agustinos]], [[Sierra de Pénjamo]], Cerro de Cubilete, Cerro de Amoles, La Purisima Dam, Arandas Mountain, La Soledad Dam, and the upper basin of the Temascatío River. Another protected area is the [[Sierra Gorda Biosphere Reserve]]. In Guanajuato, it extends over 236,882 hectares and contains 182 bird species, 42 mammal species and 84 plant species, including two recently discovered ones, ''[[Beaucamea compacta]]'' and ''[[Calibanus glassianus]]''. The park contains a number of species in danger of extinction, including the black bear and the [[Cougar|puma]]. The climate is semiarid with variations in temperature due to altitude changes, but most of the area is covered in tropical forest in which many plants lose leaves during the dry season from November to May.<ref name="r51"/>

==History==

===Pre-Hispanic era===
[[File:Chupicuaro statuette Louvre 70-1998-3-1.jpg|thumb|[[Chupícuaro (archaeological site)|Chupícuaro]] statuette at the [[Louvre]]]]

In the pre-Hispanic era, the Bajio saw the most human development due to the fertility of the soil and the presence of surface water for agriculture.<ref name="trabajos"/> The oldest group to inhabit the area were the people now known as the Chupícuarios, who dominated the center of the Bajío area and were active between 800 BCE and 300 CE.<ref name="r30"/><ref name="arqueomex">{{cite web |url= http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nArqueologia92.html |author= Beatriz Braniff C. |title= Guanajuato en la historia |year= 1993 |work= Arqueologia Mexicana |publisher= Editorial Raíces S.A. de C.V. |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Guanajuato in history |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101127035803/http://arqueomex.com/S2N3nArqueologia92.html |archive-date= November 27, 2010 }}</ref> Their largest city is now the site called [[Chupícuaro (archaeological site)|Chupícuaro]], and their influence was widespread being found in the modern states of Zacatecas, Querétaro, [[Colima]], [[Nayarit]], Hidalgo, State of Mexico, Michoacán and [[Guerrero]]. Chupícuaro cities were associated with the [[Toltec]] city of [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]] and when this city fell, these agricultural cities of Guanajuato also went into decline.<ref name="r30"/> This and a prolonged drought cause these cities to be abandoned between the 10th and 11th centuries with only the [[Guamare]]s left ethnically.<ref name="nomenclatura">{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Nomenclatura |year= 2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Nomenclature |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120327111429/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |archive-date= March 27, 2012 }}</ref>

Then [[Chichimeca]] and other nomadic groups entered the area. These nomadic indigenous groups are generically referred to as Chichimeca, but in reality they were a variety of ethnicities such as the [[Guachichiles]], [[Chichimeca Jonaz people|Chichimeca Jonaz]] and [[Guamare]]s. These groups were warlike, semi nomadic and did not practice significant agriculture, nor did they construct cities.<ref name="r30"/> Part of the state was also inhabited by the [[Otomi]] but they were mostly displaced or dominated by the [[Purépecha]] in the southwest and the Chichimeca in other parts.<ref name="nomenclatura"/> By the 16th century, most of [[Mesoamerica]] was dominated by either the [[Aztec Empire]] or [[Purépecha Empire]], but Guanajuato was under the control of neither. It was on the northern border of the Purépecha Empire with southern Guanajuato showing significant cultural influence in the southern valleys, and Aztecs had ventured into the area looking for minerals. However, most of the state was dominated by various Chichimeca tribes as part of what the Spanish would call the "Gran Chichimeca". These Chichimeca were mostly nomadic with some scattered agricultural communities, mostly in the north.<ref name="arqueomex"/>

=== Spanish colonial period ===

[[File:Hacienda jaral de berrios.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jaral de Berrios]], one of the most important [[hacienda]]s of the colonial era.]]

As the area of Guanajuato lies on the boundary of the arid north of Mexico, at first relatively few Spanish came to settle - as opposed to points south, which had much more abundant rainfall and indigenous labor.<ref name="arqueomex"/> The first Spanish expedition to visit the Guanajuato area, led by [[Cristóbal de Olid]] in 1522, arrived in the Yuririhapúndaro and Pénjamo areas. The discovery of silver and gold in the area of the city of Guanajuato spurred Spanish settlement of the area in the 1520s and 1530s.<ref name="enchistoria">

Following the Spanish arrival, native tribes retreated to the most inaccessible areas of the Bajío and to the mountain ranges in the state, resisting the invaders, attacking settlements and travelers along the routes that connected Spanish settlements and mining camps. The Spanish were unable to force the natives of this area (unlike the more settled [[indigenous peoples]]) to work, and brought African slaves and indigenous peoples from other areas to work the [[hacienda]]s and mines.<ref name="r3031">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 30–31</ref> The colonization efforts in the eastern part of the state began in 1542 when Spanish land-grants were issued for the Apaseo and [[Chamácuaro]] areas. In 1555 [[San Miguel de Allende|San Miguel el Grande]] was founded to protect roads linking mining camps and cities with Mexico City to the south-east. The [[León, Guanajuato|Villa de León]] was founded in 1576 to counter attacks by the indigenous peoples. But through the first centuries of the colonial period, the city of Guanajuato dominated because of its mines.<ref name="enchistoria"/> The official name of the state is ''Guanajuato, Estado Libre y Soberano'' (Guanajuato, Free and Sovereign State). "Guanajuato" comes from Purépecha ''Quanaxhuato'', which has been translated as both "place of frogs" and "places of many hills". The coat of arms of the state is that of the city of Guanajuato, as granted by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor |Carlos I of Spain]]<ref name="nomenclatura"/> ({{reign | 1516 | 1556}}).

In 1590 the Villa de San Luis de la Paz was founded and named after the peace (''paz'') treaty between the Spanish and the Chichimeca.<ref name="enchistoria"/> With the Spanish occupying most of the most productive land and its resources, the indigenous of the area became extremely impoverished. This eventually allowed the Spanish to negotiate peace with chiefs in exchange for basic goods such as blankets, clothes and food. This would bring temporary truces. [[Evangelization]] efforts would bring longer-term submission. [[Franciscans]] and [[Augustinians]] worked to gradually modify the worldview of the Chichimecas and others until many moved out of the mountains and into other settlements and professed, at least nominally, the Catholic faith. However, the indigenous remained extremely marginalized and poor, losing both their language and their culture until most eventually intermarried with outsiders to produce [[mestizos]].<ref name="r31">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 31</ref>
Through the Spanish colonial period, most of the area's wealth came from mining, with much of the agriculture springing up to support the mining communities. The height of mining came in the 18th century, mostly from the mines in the hills around the city of Guanajuato, leading to the construction of a large number of notable civil and religious buildings in the same area.<ref name="enchistoria"/> The extremely fertile Bajío area became a major agricultural area for [[New Spain]]. Both mining and agriculture brought in more Spanish and [[Criollo people|Criollos]] to take advantage, as well as mestizos and some African slaves to work the mines and fields, making the area's population grow rapidly and eventually concentrate in urban centers.<ref name="r31"/> The area became an [[Intendant|intendancy]] ({{langx |es| intendencia}}) or province in 1786, when the authorities divided New Spain into twelve parts.<ref name="enchistoria"/>

===Independence and 19th century===
[[File:Nebel Voyage 32 Guanajuato.jpg|thumb|''Plaza Mayor de Guanajuato'', view of the main square of [[Guanajuato, Guanajuato|Guanajuato]], c. 1836 [[Carl Nebel]]]]
Despite the riches the area produced, most lived in oppression and poverty at the end of the 18th century, working on haciendas and in mines while a few, mostly European-born Spaniards, lived in opulence. Not only the indigenous, mestizo and Negro slaves were having problems with the social order. Many Criollos or New World-born Spanish were marginalized by the Spain-born.<ref name="r31" /> One of the first rebellions against colonial rule came in 1766, when a group attacked the Caja Real in Guanajuato city to protest high taxes. In 1767, there were protests against the expulsion of the [[Jesuits]] by the [[Spanish Crown]]. These were put down with extreme force, but they spurred conspiracies, and groups organizing against colonial rule, especially in San Miguel el Grande and León.<ref name="r32">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 32</ref>

Numerous plans were made, but few were carried out or had impact until 1809. In that year, a group consisting of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], [[Ignacio Allende]], [[Juan Aldama]], [[Miguel Domínguez]] and more, began to plan an armed revolt against the colonial government. In 1810, the plot was discovered and Hidalgo decided to put their plans into action in September instead of the planned date in December.<ref name="r32" /> On 15 September, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla declared the [[Grito de Dolores]] in the town of Dolores (Hidalgo). Hidalgo, accompanied by Ignacio Allende, left Dolores with about 800 men, half of whom were on horseback.<ref name="elbalero">{{cite web |url=http://www.elbalero.gob.mx/historia/html/independ/biohidalgo.html |title=DonMiguel Hidalgo y Costilla(1753–1811)|access-date=27 November 2008 |language=es|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20080822042337/http://www.elbalero.gob.mx/historia/html/independ/biohidalgo.html|archive-date=August 22, 2008}}</ref> Through sheer numbers, Hidalgo's army had some early victories,<ref name="Vazquez" /> progressing through the economically important and densely populated province of Guanajuato.<ref name="Hamnett">{{cite book |last=Hamnett |first=Brian R |title=Concise History of Mexico |url=https://archive.org/details/concisehistoryof0000hamn |url-access=registration |year=1999 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Port Chester, New York, USA |isbn=978-0-521-58120-2}}</ref> One of Hidalgo's first stops was at the [[Sanctuary of Atotonilco]].

Military commanders [[Luis de Cortázar]] and [[Anastasio Bustamante]] joined forces with [[Agustín de Iturbide]] and took the city of Guanajuato on 8 July 1821, declaring the entire state independent of Spanish rule. In 1824, Guanajuato was officially proclaimed a state of Mexico by the Constitutional Congress of Mexico.<ref name="enchistoria" />
[[File:Trolley passing in front of the San Diego Church in Guanajuato, Mexico (1907).jpg|thumb|upright|Trolley passing in front of the San Diego Church in Guanajuato, 1907]]

The years after the end of the War of Independence were extremely unstable, and would continue to be unstable through most of the rest of the 19th century. The towns of Dolores and San Miguel adopted the names of Dolores Hidalgo and San Miguel de Allende in honor of those who began the independence movement and in 1826, the first constitution of the state of Guanajuato was adopted.<ref name="r32" /> Like much of the rest of the country, Guanajuato was affected by the prolonged fighting between Liberal and Conservative factions as well as the foreign incursions that dominated the 19th century. Guanajuato's status vacillated between state (when Liberals were in charge) and department (when Conservatives held the upper hand). Under Liberal ideals, educational institutions such as the Colegio de la Santisima Trinidad and the Colegio de la Purisima Concepción were secularized and under control of the State.<ref name="r32" /> In 1847, General [[Gabriel Valencia]] raised an army of 6,000 men to fight the [[Mexican–American War|U.S. invasion of Mexico]]. In 1848, in opposition to the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], General Marian Paredes, General [[Manuel Doblado]] and priest [[Celedonio Dómeco de Jarauta]] revolted, taking the state capital, but they were defeated and Doméco was executed by firing squad.<ref name="enchistoria" /> In 1855, Conservative Manuel Doblado, then the governor of Guanajuato, forced [[Juan Álvarez]] out of the presidency after he took power from [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]].<ref name="r32" /> In 1858, the government under President [[Benito Juárez]] moved from Mexico City to the city of Guanajuato before moving again to [[Manzanillo, Colima|Manzanillo]] and then [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] during the [[Reform War]]. During this three-year period, the state would vacillate various times between the Liberals and Conservatives. In 1863, it was taken over by the French as they installed [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] as emperor of Mexico. Maximillian did not reign long but the governor he appointed for Guanajuato, [[Florencio Antillón]] remained in Guanajuato until 1877.<ref name="enchistoria" />

===Mexican Revolution to the present===
The situation stabilized over much of the government of Porfirio Díaz at the end of the 19th century and the economy improved, but the Diaz government was oppressive. Diaz installed [[Francisco Mena]] as governor of the state, who made a fortune through the concession of railway lines which were being built to modernize the country. Even though slavery was officially abolished during the War of Independence, most laborers in farms and mines were extremely underpaid and in a number of cases not paid at all. Agricultural production reached a peak at the end of the 19th century, earning the state the nickname of the "granary of the Republic". Industrialization took hold in cities such as [[León, Guanajuato|León]], [[Salvatierra, Guanajuato|Salvatierra]], [[Celaya]] and [[San Francisco del Rincón]], making shoes, textiles and hats.<ref name="r3233">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 32–33</ref> One battle of the [[Mexican Revolution]] occurred in Celaya in 1915 between the troops of [[Álvaro Obregón]] and [[Francisco Villa]].<ref name="enchistoria"/> Many from the state fought and died in other parts of Mexico, leaving behind widows and children. After the war, the large landholdings were broken up and land redistributed into [[ejido]]s, or commonly held land, which benefitted many rural families.<ref name="r33">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 33</ref>

After the end of the Mexican Revolution, fighting in Mexico continues with the [[Cristero War]]. Fighting related to this was most prominent in [[Pénjamo]] and León, but occurred in other areas as well. In 1946, an uprising against the government by a group called the [[Sinarquistas]] occurred in Leon.<ref name="enchistoria"/> However, most of the state was peaceful most of the time, allowing the economy to recover. This was especially true of the agricultural sector, producing wheat, corn, sorghum, alfalfa, strawberries in Irapuato and goats in various parts. Goat milk cajeta candy from Celaya is known in most of Mexico.<ref name="r34">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 34</ref> The first Festival Internacional Cervantino occurred in 1972.<ref name="enchistoria"/> In the 1980s, two of the state's cities, [[Guanajuato City|Guanajuato]] and [[San Miguel de Allende]] were declared [[World Heritage Site]]s.<ref name="r34"/>

Today, the Bajio is one of the major grain producing regions in Mexico.<ref name="trabajos"/> The Guanajuato congress has asked for help against the theft of religious art in the state, which has the third highest incidence of such. One of the major occurrences was the theft of the gold crown of the Black Christ of [[Salamanca, Guanajuato|Salamanca]] in 2010.<ref name="artesacro">{{cite news |title= Pide Guanajuato legislar sobre el robo de arte sacro |agency=Agencia el Universal. |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=September 1, 2010 |page=1 |language=es |trans-title=Guanajuato asks for legislation against the theft of religious art}}</ref> The celebration of Mexico's Bicentennial was particularly important to the state as initial events of the War in Independence occurred here. The state set up a Bicentennial Route to encourage visitors to the cities associated with Miguel Hidalgo's first campaigns. The state held a marathon from San Miguel Allende to Dolores Hidalgo for the Bicentennial with Omar Luna winning with a time of 2h23m14s.<ref name="categorias">{{cite news |title= Gana México todas las categorías en Maratón Bicentenario |agency=Agencia el Universal|newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=October 17, 2010 |language=es |trans-title=Mexico wins in all categories of the Bicentennial Marathon}}</ref> The state sponsored the Expo Bicentenario 2010 from 17 July to 20 November just outside the capital city. The site was marked by a giant Mexican flag flying alongside older historic flags, including a replica of the standard with an image of the Virgin of Guadalupe that Miguel Hidalgo carried as the insurgent banner. The Expo was housed in a series of pavilions which demonstrated the Mexican culture, history, traditions and customs. There were also pavilions hosted by various Latin American countries who also celebrated their Bicentennials around the same time.<ref name="d51">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 51</ref><ref name="revive">{{cite news |title= Revive en Guanajuato ruta de la Independencia |author=Cristóbal Martínez. |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=October 10, 2010 |page=6 |language=es |trans-title=Relive the independence route in Guanajuato}}</ref> In 2023, the southern town of [[Salvatierra, Guanajuato|Salvatierra]] experienced a [[2023 Salvatierra Massacre|mass shooting at a private Christmas party]] in which 12 people were left dead and 25 were left injured.

As of 2005, the state had a population of 4,893,812,<ref name="numerohab">{{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/gto/poblacion/default.aspx?tema=me&e=11 |title= Número de habitantes |publisher= [[INEGI]] |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Number of inhabitants |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120311215704/http://cuentame.inegi.org.mx/monografias/informacion/gto/poblacion/default.aspx?tema=me&e=11 |archive-date= March 11, 2012 }}</ref> which is the sixth largest population in Mexico. About 67% live in urban areas, with the rest in rural areas, and women slightly outnumbering men. The largest population centers are León with 1,134,842 people, Irapuato with 440,134, Celaya with 382,958, and Salamanca with 226,654.<ref name="perfilsoc"/>

===Religion===
Over 94% of the population professes the Catholic religion,<ref name="perfilsoc"/> and the state is considered to be very conservative and adherent to Catholic principles both socially and politically.

===Indigenous peoples===
Guanajuato has the fourth lowest number of people who can speak an indigenous language. However, the ethnically indigenous population is about 10,347 (2005) or 2.6% of the population over the age of five. The languages spoken are [[Chichimeca Jonaz language|Chichimeca Jonaz]], [[Otomi language|Otomi]] and [[Nahuatl]].<ref name="perfilsoc"/> The two most important indigenous groups are the [[Chichimeca Jonaz people|Chichimeca Jonaz]] and the [[Otomi people|Otomi]], both of which are concentrated in the Valles de Sur area. Culturally, both groups show significant Purépecha influence. Both live in arid regions, where rainfall is precious and the diet includes foods such as [[pitaya]]s, [[Myrtillocactus geometrizans]] (garambullo), cactus pear, nopal and [[agave]]. Hunting was an important source of protein but the scarcity of game has all but extinguished this practice. Subsistence agriculture forms the basis of the economy and provides much of the current diet. However, these peoples are extremely poor, and many migrate to other places to find work.<ref name="r1819">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 18–19</ref>
In what is now the state of Guanajuato, there were a number [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]]) groups who built cities in the first millennium CE. but then abandoned them long before the arrival of the Spanish.<ref name="r18">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 18</ref> It is believed that the Chichimeca came to dominate the area after the fall of these cities, and the Chichimeca Jonaz believe that the eagle, which is sacred to them, led them here.<ref name="r30">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 30</ref> At the time of the Spanish conquest, the only Chichimeca group left were the Chichimeca Jonaz, who were semi-nomadic and warlike. These qualities allowed these Chichimecas to resist Spanish domination for many years. However, the deterioration of the environment by the Spanish depleted resources for these people and finally made them submit.<ref name="r18"/>

The Chichimeca Jonaz refer to themselves and other indigenous as "uza" (singular) or "ézar" (plural), which roughly translates to "Indian". Their language is [[Oto-Pamean languages|Oto-Pamean]] and related to their neighbors, the Otomi. Most Chichimecas are found in the municipality of San Luis de la Paz, in the community of Rancho Uza or Mision Chichimeca. This community subdivides into the Mision de Abajo in the east and Mision de Arriba in the west. This area borders lands of the Huasteca and [[Pame people|Pame]] groups, and there have been conflicts among the three.<ref name="r18"/> The Chichimeca Jonaz have a mixed Catholic-indigenous belief system. While outwardly Catholic, many rituals still follow the cycles found in nature, such as planting and harvesting and lunar cycles. The most important "spirit guides" are the eagle and water, with the Virgin of Guadalupe playing an important role as Universal Mother. One important saint is [[Isidore the Laborer]], who is connected to the bringing of rain.<ref name="r1819"/>

The Otomis of the state are concentrated in the community of Cieneguilla in the municipality of [[Tierra Blanca, Guanajuato|Tierra Blanca]]. In pre-Hispanic times, these people were semi-nomadic, desert dwellers. During the Conquest, these and other Otomi groups allied themselves with the Spanish, in part because the Aztecs and others considered the Otomi to be backwards and barbaric. The Otomi also speak an Oto-Pamean language and are related to other Otomi groups scattered around the central and southern areas of Mexico. Today, however, most children are not learning the language from their parents, putting it in danger of extinction in spite of efforts to introduce bilingual education.<ref name="r1920">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 19–20</ref>

===Immigration===

There is a growing presence of East Asians, primarily Japanese, in the Bajio region. As of early 2014, there were more than three thousand [[Japanese immigration to Mexico|Japanese immigrants]] in the Bajio area, and it's claimed that this population is larger than the historical [[Japanese community in Mexico City]].<ref name="Universal">{{cite web |url=http://eluniversalqueretaro.mx/metropoli/06-01-2014/3-mil-japoneses-en-queretaro |title=3 mil japoneses en Querétaro |publisher=El Universal |access-date=November 9, 2014 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141110031237/http://www.eluniversalqueretaro.mx/metropoli/06-01-2014/3-mil-japoneses-en-queretaro |archive-date=November 10, 2014 }}</ref> The Guanajuato government believes that by 2016 there will be five thousand families installed in the region.<ref name="Financiero">{{cite web |url= http://elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/queretaro-el-nuevo-territorio-japones.html |title= Querétaro, el nuevo territorio japonés |date= 26 February 2014 |publisher= El Financiero |access-date= October 18, 2014 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20141019015128/http://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/economia/queretaro-el-nuevo-territorio-japones.html |archive-date= October 19, 2014 }}</ref> This immigration is being driven by foreign investment in the Bajio, especially in the automotive sector.

==Economy==
Being located in the center of the country has important economic implications for the state, as a number of major national highways and railways pass through. The state is also a center of industry with most of the state's major cities and economy located in the La Sierra Central and El Bajío regions.<ref name="mediofisico"/><ref name="r50"/> It has equal access to both the Pacific Ocean and Gulf of Mexico as well as the major metropolitan areas of [[Monterrey]], Mexico City and [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]].<ref name="mediofisico"/> In 2008, the total GDP for the state was US$38,204,000,000 (427,503,000,000 MXN) or 3.88% of the total for the country. From 2003 to 2008, the economy grew 1.06% (adjusted for inflation). The state has the sixth-largest economy in Mexico behind Mexico City, the [[State of Mexico]], [[Nuevo León]], Jalisco, and [[Veracruz]]. As of 2008, Guanajuato ranks fourth in per capita income at US$7,609, behind Mexico City, Nuevo León and Jalisco, with a rate of increase of 2.04%. Manufacturing accounts for 28% of total GDP, down slightly from a high of over 30%. Its importance is followed by commerce at 16.3% and real estate at 11.2%. Agriculture, which includes forestry, fishing and hunting accounts for 4.6.<ref name="iplaneg">{{cite web |url=http://iplaneg.guanajuato.gob.mx/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=11933&folderId=25646&name=DLFE-2801.pdf |title=La Economía del estado de Guanajuato |date=April 27, 2010 |publisher=Government of Guanajuato IPLANEG |location=Guanajuato, Mexico |language=es |trans-title=The economy of the state of Guanajuato |access-date=November 29, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722225130/http://iplaneg.guanajuato.gob.mx/c/document_library/get_file?p_l_id=11933&folderId=25646&name=DLFE-2801.pdf |archive-date=July 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Other activities include financial and other professional services (17.6%) and transportation and storage at 11.8%.<ref name="econinegi">{{cite web |url= http://cuentame.inegi.gob.mx/monografias/informacion/gto/economia/default.aspx?tema=me&e=11 |title= Actividades económicas |publisher= [[INEGI]] |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Economic activities |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110112205900/http://cuentame.inegi.gob.mx/monografias/informacion/gto/economia/default.aspx?tema=me&e=11 |archive-date= January 12, 2011 |df= mdy-all }}</ref> Employment figures break down differently with 13.2% employed in agriculture, 36.4% in mining and industry and 47.3 percent in commerce, services and tourism.<ref name="actecon">{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Actividad Económica |year= 2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Economic activity |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120327111429/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |archive-date= March 27, 2012 }}</ref> There are two significant migration patterns in the state.

===Industry, crafts and mining===
{{see also|Guanajuato handcrafts and folk art}}
[[File:Mina La Valenciana.jpg|thumb|''Rayas'' mine near the city of Guanajuato]]
Industry is the most important segment in the modern state economy, accounting for about 30%. Most of this is the production of automobiles and automobile parts, pharmaceuticals and other modern items. It also includes more traditional items such as processed foods (cheese, canned items and more) as well as shoes and other leather goods in León and a variety of crafts.<ref name="actecon"/> The economy in this area continues to grow although there has been some drop in its percentage of GDP due to drop in prices for a number of manufactured products.<ref name="iplaneg"/> The state has two large thermoelectrical plants in Salamanca and Celaya. Oil refining in Salamanca received raw material through pipelines from [[Poza Rica, Veracruz]] and from [[Tabasco]].<ref name="mediofisico"/>

One traditional industry is the making of shoes and other leather items, especially in León. This industry grew 50% from 2009 to 2010 in the number of enterprises dedicated to it. They now total 7,981 and employ 297,413 people directly and indirectly according to [[INEGI]].<ref name="crecen50">{{cite news |title= Crecen más del 50% empresas del calzado y piel |agency=Agencia el Universal. |newspaper= El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=September 23, 2010 |page=1 |language=es |trans-title=Footwear and leather enterprises grow more than 50%}}</ref> In 2010, Volkswagen announced a new motor plant to be built in [[Silao]]. The project is projected to cost US$550 million and will employ 700 people making 330,000 motors per year starting in 2013. A spokesman for the company acknowledged that part of the reason to build the plant was the existence of a General Motors plant in the same area as well as the existence of the Parque Industrial Puerto Interior which offers access to different transportation modes.<ref name="Volkswagen">{{cite news |title= Acelera Volkswagen en México |author=Sara Cantera. |newspaper= El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=September 23, 2010 |page=1 |language=es |trans-title=Volkswagen accelerates in Mexico}}</ref> The Centro de Innovación (Innovation Center) of Microsoft was inaugurated in 2010 in León.

Almost all handcrafts (98%) are made in micro and small enterprises, most of which are family-owned. Almost all them, which mostly consist of glass, wrought iron, ceramic and wooden items, are exported to the United States (91%). However, craft items are under pressure from imitations from Central America and Asia. The crafts sector of industry is not considered a particularly active segment of the state's population with no data as to the percentage of the state's GDP it represents.<ref name="sdeartesanias">{{cite web |url= http://sde.guanajuato.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21&Itemid=52 |title= Sector |publisher= Secretaria de Desarrollor Economico Sustenible |location= Guanajuato, Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Handcrafts sector |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= live |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101205053433/http://sde.guanajuato.gob.mx/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21&Itemid=52 |archive-date= December 5, 2010 }}</ref> Most crafts over time have become specialties of more or more municipalities.<ref name="r42">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 42</ref>

[[Tin-glazed pottery|Majolica]] pottery has been made in the state since colonial times after being introduced by the Spanish. Since then, areas have developed specialties in form and decoration, but techniques have not changed much for over 400 years. Most clay is extracted from the Dolores Hidalgo region and most is produced in Dolores Hidalgo, San Miguel de Allende and the city of Guanajuato.<ref name="r4243">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 42–43</ref> Another area noted for its work is Tarandacuaro, which makes high-fire ceramics. The two best-known workshops are Fabrica Javier Servin and Taller Checuan. The ceramics of this area have distinctive, very intricate, mostly geometric designs, which are painted on by hand. The municipality promotes the work through its Centro Turistico de Desarrollo de Tarandacuao.<ref name="d39">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 39</ref>

Acámbaro is noted for its bread. One local bread specialty is the ''tallado'', which has a base of egg and butter and can have fillings such as [[Common fig|fig]], coconut, raisins and chocolate. This bread is the result of recipes brought by the [[Franciscans]], modified over time by the native indigenous potters’ community.<ref name="d38">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 38</ref>

[[San Francisco del Rincón]] has had a tradition of making hats since the 18th century. Traditionally, the hats were made from palm fronds brought from the Michoacán coast area, but today many workshops and factories use synthetic fibers. In traditional workshops, the work is divided by sex, with women weaving the fibers together and men pressing it into shape, putting in the supports and other details. The quality of the hats made here has made them exportable.<ref name="r44">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 44</ref>

In San Luis de la Paz and Coroneo, wool is worked into clothing, especially into coats, gloves, vests, scarves and other items for winter wear. Some of the workshops still work with large old weaving looms. In addition, there are workshops which make rugs, [[zarape]]s, and other items for the home.<ref name="r44"/> In Coroneo, the craft 100 years ago was practiced only by women. The most common item is still the zarape, which is decorated with figures such as horse heads and deer as well as fretwork on the edges. However, sweaters, capes, [[rebozo]]s, bags and even wool shoes can also be found for sale. One other specialty is rugs woven on large looms.<ref name="d39"/>

Apaseo el Alto is known for its work in fine woods, which began with the workshop of Domingo Garcia sixty years ago. Since then, about 150 workshops have been established in the municipality, employing about 500 craftsmen. Items include sculptures such as religious figures and animals and utilitarian items such as utensils and furniture. Craftsmen first began working with a wood called "patol" and [[juniper]], but today they work with various woods such as walnut, [[Cedar wood|cedar]], [[mahogany]] and ''[[Ceiba pentandra]]'' (the kapok).<ref name="d40">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 40</ref><ref name="r4344">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 43–44</ref>

[[File:Celaya-bola.jpg|thumbnail|The ''bola de agua'' in Celaya; the [[water tower]] is an icon of the city.]]
Celaya is known in much of Mexico for its [[cajeta]], a kind of spreadable caramel, often made with goat's milk, sugar and cinnamon. The mixture can be eaten straight from a spoon or used in a variety of recipes. The best known outlet for cajeta in the city is Cajetas La Tradicional, which has been in business for over 70 years.<ref name="d40"/>

Metalworking can mostly be found in the communities of Guanajuato and Salamanca. Although the capital's mines no longer produce large quantities of gold and silver, silver items are still made and sold in the city. Wrought iron work for doors, windows and railings are also a specialty in certain areas of the city. Oxidized bronze items are a specialty of Salamanca, producing mostly decorative items.<ref name="r43">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 43</ref> Most of the items made in Guanajuato city are still done Baroque style and sold in the city center.<ref name="d4345">Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 43–45</ref> Pénjamo is one of very few places outside of the state of Jalisco to produce [[tequila]]. It is the home of the [[Tequila Corralejo]] brand, which is still made on the now former hacienda of Corralejo. The installation gives tours and has a museum called the Museo del Vino y la Botellas (Museum of Spirits and Bottles). The museum contains a collection of about 3,000 bottles, almost all of which with their original contents. Nearby is the factory that makes the distinctive blue bottles of this brand.<ref name="d44">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 44</ref>

Glass making was brought to Mexico during the early colonial period. Most items made in Guanajuato are single-colored items in blue, green, yellow and red. San Miguel de Allende has the best-known tradition where curiously shaped bottles, vases, glass sets and small cups for tequila are produced.<ref name="r44"/> Wax candles and other items are a specialty in Salamanca, where they are especially in demand during [[Holy Week]].<ref name="r43"/> Comonfort is known for the making of [[molcajete]]s from volcanic stone, and San Miguel is known for figures and other items made from brass. Dolores Hidalgo is known for ice cream and ices, much of which is simply sold next to the parish church. Flavors include [[sapote]], mango, honey, [[aloe]], tequila and banana.<ref name="d41">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 41</ref>

Mining, manufacturing and construction accounts for over 27% of the state's GDP.<ref name="actecon"/> Mining is a traditional economic activity for the state, with deposits making it one of the world's richest areas in the past. However, in comparison gold and silver ores are mostly depleted today.<ref name="mediofisico"/> Gold and silver ore is still mined with silver still the major ore produced, followed by gold, lead, copper, [[zinc]] and [[sulfur]]. Most employed in mining are still related to metals rather than non-metals.<ref name="actecon"/> Other products being mined or being studied are [[mercury (element)|mercury]], [[tin]], [[copper]], [[lead]], sand, [[fluorite]], [[feldspar]], lime, [[kaolin]], and more.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

===Agriculture===
While the agricultural sector, which includes crops, livestock, fishing and forestry activities, accounts for only 4.6% of Guanajuato's current GDP, the sector is an important part of the state's identity and is still a major producer of a number of items nationally.<ref name="iplaneg"/><ref name="actecon"/> The state has 1.1 million hectares suitable for agriculture, over 36% of the state's territory.<ref name="mediofisico"/> Over {{convert|659,000|ha}} of land is under cultivation, with the main crops being corn, sorghum, beans, wheat, barley and broccoli.<ref name="actecon"/> Today, the Bajio is still one of the major grain producing regions in Mexico.<ref name="trabajos"/> Certain areas of the state have large orchards producing peaches, strawberries, cactus pear, avocado, grapes, apples, quince, walnuts, apricots and guava.<ref name="mediofisico"/>

Livestock raising is an important economic activity and can be found in all parts of the state, with animals such cattle, pigs, goats, sheep and domestic fowl,<ref name="mediofisico"/> with {{convert|1,451,478|ha}} hectares dedicated to this activity.<ref name="actecon"/> The Los Altos and Bajío are the state's livestock producing regions, especially dairy cows. It is one of the most important dairy producing states in Mexico.<ref name="d9">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 9</ref> By volume, most of the meat produced is from domestic fowl, with pork coming in second, followed by beef, goat and sheep.<ref name="actecon"/> Guanajuato produces 25.4% of the goat meat in the country.<ref name="pierde">{{cite news |title= Pierde Estado interés en producir cabritos |author=Ludivina Ruiz |newspaper=El Norte |location=Monterrey, Mexico |date=October 18, 2010 |page=7 |language=es |trans-title=State loses interest in producing goats}}</ref>

Only a very small percentage of the economy is based on fishing and forestry. Fishing is not a major economic activity as it is limited to the small rivers and lakes of the region. Of the two major lakes, one is shared with neighboring Michoacán state. Of the fish is that is caught or raised, most is [[carp]], followed by [[mojarra]].<ref name="actecon"/> There are 150,000 hectares of forest in the state, which about half theoretically exploitable. However, forests in this state have been historically depleted with species such as holm oak, pine and [[oyamel]] in danger of extinction. The lack of forest cover has led to erosion and other environmental problems.<ref name="mediofisico"/> Most forestry products come from pine and holm oak, with most being harvested in the area around the city of Guanajuato.<ref name="actecon"/>

About 95% of the state's visitors are from Mexico, with the rest from other countries. Within the state, there are about seventy hotels ranked as four or five stars.<ref name="actecon"/> The three main cities for tourism are the capital city of Guanajuato, San Miguel de Allende and Dolores Hidalgo. Guanajuato is visited for its colonial architecture and its role in Mexico's history, especially during the [[Mexican War of Independence|War of Independence]]. Similarly, San Miguel has cultural and historical value. Both have been designated World Heritage Sites. Although not a World Heritage Site, Dolores Hidalgo is particularly important as the site as it is where Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla gave the cry called "El Grito" which began the War of Independence.<ref name="atractivos">{{cite web |url= http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |title= Atractivos Culturales y Turísticos |year= 2005 |work= Enciclopedia de los Municipios de México Estado de Guanajuato |publisher= Instituto Nacional para el Federalismo y el Desarrollo Municipal |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Cultural and Tourist Attractions |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120327111429/http://www.inafed.gob.mx/wb2/ELOCAL/EMM_guanajuato |archive-date= March 27, 2012 }}</ref>

The state has set up tourist routes such as the Ruta de Independencia, Ruta de Aventura (Aventure Route), Ruta Arqueológica (Archeological Route), Ruta de los Conventos (Monastery Route) and Ruta Artesanal (Handcrafts Route). The Ruta de la Independencia or Independence Route comprises ten municipalities through which the insurgent army under Miguel Hidalgo passed. These include San Miguel de Allende, Dolores Hidalgo, Guanajuato, León, Irapuato, Pénjamo, Salamanca, Celaya, [[Salvatierra, Guanajuato|Salvatierra]] and Acámbaro. In preparation for the Bicentennial of Mexico's independence, the state rehabilitated and marked the sites in which the significant historic events occurred in each of these locations.<ref name="d7">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 7</ref>

The Ruta de Aventura connects ghost towns and abandoned mines with natural areas for hiking, mountain biking and ATV as well as other extreme sports such as [[paragliding]]. One of the ghost towns is Mineral de Pozos in the northeast of the state. The town still has its cobblestone streets with names such as Relámpago (lightning), Estrellas (stars) and Flores (Flowers). The houses here are abandoned, many in ruins and none with roofs. The town reached its height during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when it was called Ciudad Porfirio Díaz, but the mines later gave out and the population left. In 1982, the town was declared a Historic Monument Zone. Although no one lives there, tourism keeps a few businesses alive around the main square such as the Pozos cantina, which exhibits photographs and other memorabilia on its walls. Outside the town is the Santa Brigida mine which sustained the town until it gave out. It is marked by three large ovens with tall pyramid roofs. These were constructed by the Jesuits to work ore from the mine.<ref name="d1213">Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 12–13</ref> The Ruta Arqueológica (Archeological Route) links the two pre-Hispanic sites of Plazuelas and Peralta which are currently open to visitors with two others which are scheduled to be opened sometime in the future: La Virgen de la Cañada in San Miguel de Allende and El Cóporo in Ocampo.<ref name="d2223">Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 22–23</ref>

The Ruta de los Conventos or Monastery Route is concentrated in the south of the state, where a number of large religious complexes were built in the early colonial period for evangelization purposes. The Agustino de San Pablo Church and Monastery is located in Yuriria founded by the [[Augustinians]] who arrived from Michoacán in the 16th century. It is a monumental fortress-like construction designed by Friar Diego de Chávez y Alvarado and Pedro del Toro and constructed in an area with relatively little population. The monastery became a center from which missionaries would be trained and then sent forth and its size and battlements helped to protect it from [[Chichimeca]] attacks. The church retains its original function and [[Plateresque]] facade, but the monastery area has been converted into a museum. The Las Capucinas Church and Convent is in Salvatierra and is one of only three complexes built for nuns in the entire state during the colonial period. It has a fortress like appearance and its construction is attributed to Joaquin de Heredia, of the [[San Carlos Academy]]. During the [[Porfirio Díaz]] presidency, the convent was used as a Civil Hospital and later as a school, which still remains with the name of Colegio José María Morelos. The San Francisco Church and Monastery is in Acámbaro and built between 1734 and 1743. Its facade is [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] of light pink stone. Inside, the church contains one of the most notable main altars in the Bajio region. It is Neoclassical built of gray and pink stone with gilded details, with an image of the Virgen María Refugio de Pecadores (Virgin Mary Refuge of Sinners), which is replica of an image in [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]].<ref name="d30">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 30</ref>

The Ruta Artesanal (Handcrafts Route) connects a number of municipalities which specialize in one or more handcrafted items, including food. These include Acámbaro, noted for its bread, Coroneo for its wool items and Tarancuaro for ceramics.<ref name="d38"/>

The state also has a large number of water parks and thermal springs converted into water parks. Some of these include El Trébol, Villa Gasco and Comanjilla near León, Caldera Abasolo near Irapuato and Abasolo and Los Arcos and Agua Caliente near Celaya.<ref name="mexdesstate">{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/guanajuato1.html |title= Guanajuato |publisher= Mexico Deconocido magazine |location= Mexico |language= es |trans-title= Guanajuato |access-date= November 29, 2010 |url-status= dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100925022435/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/guanajuato1.html |archive-date= September 25, 2010 |df= mdy-all }}</ref>

===Cuisine===
[[File:BirriaGuanajuato.JPG|thumb|A [[birria]] dish served at the Mercado Hidalgo in Guanajuato]]
Many of the dishes that are traditionally eaten in Guanajuato are regional variations of dishes known in other parts such as [[carnitas]], [[tamale]]s, [[birria]] and [[pozole]].<ref name="d3435">Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 34–35</ref> A version of the [[enchilada]] is called the ''enchilada minero'' (miners’ enchilada), which is a tortilla fried in lard and then filled with chicken and covered with a sauce made with [[guajillo chili]] peppers, a [[Cheeses of Mexico|ranchero cheese]] and chopped potatoes and carrots.<ref name="r45">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 45</ref> Recently, there has been a movement to update many of these dishes, keeping to traditional ingredients, called "Guanajuato fusion". This is most popular in upscale restaurants in San Miguel de Allende and Guanajuato and can include dishes such as tuna with chili peppers and duck with mesquite honey.<ref name="d3435"/>

The state is better known as the producer of a number of food products such as cajeta, bread, candy, and ice cream. The best-known food product is ''cajeta'', a soft, spreadable sweet product made with goat's milk, sugar, and flavorings. The best known place for this is Celaya. The cajeta can be flavored with vanilla, coconut, strawberry, and others; it is eaten with a spoon from the container, spread on bread, or made into candies. Another typical sweet in the state is called [[charamuscas]]. It is made with [[piloncillo]], which is melted to form shapes. In the city of Guanajuato, one can find charamuscas in the shape of mummies. Alfeñique refers to glass sugar based candies used to form figures and is most popular for [[Day of the Dead]]. Chilacayote is a candy made from a type of [[Chilacayote|melon of the same name]], which is prepared by soaking pieces of the fruit in sugar solution. Handmade ice cream is a specialty of Dolores Hidalgo, made with all natural ingredients, often using recipes passed down for generations. While ice cream and ices are made in other parts of the state, these stand out because of the many unusual flavors offered such as beer, [[pulque]], [[chile relleno]], even shrimp and [[mole (sauce)|mole]]. <!--(rincones45) --> The Franciscans taught the indigenous how to work with wheat and bake bread. Because there had already been a tradition of kneading clay for pottery, the kneading and baking of wheat bread became established quickly, adapting the original recipes to local tastes. The best known breads are those from Acámbaro, especially the type called "pan grande". Other well-known types are pan ranchero, tallado, pan huevo and pan leche. The first indigenous master baker in Guanajuato was Abraham de Silva Cuín, who, in 1526, began to make breads in unique forms and flavors.<ref name="r45"/>

Most of the state's architecturally significant buildings are in Mexican Baroque style, especially in the capital city. This was because the mines of the state were at maximum production during the 18th century, when this style was fashionable. It can be found in mansions and civil buildings of that time but the most ornate examples are churches, with intricate facades and altarpieces both which often use the "estipite" column (inverted, truncated pyramid). A number of Baroque [[altarpiece]]s from this time are also gilded with gold from local mines.<ref name="r13">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 13</ref> Within the city of Guanajuato, the most notable examples are the San Cayetano or La Valenciana Church, the Basilica of Guanajuato, the Temple of the Company of Jesus and the San Roque Church. Outside the capital, notable examples include the Parish of Nuestra Señora de los Dolores, the La Tercera Orden Temple and the Casa de Visitas in Dolores Hidalgo, the San Francisco Church and Monastery and the San Agustin Church in Celaya, and the Basilica Cathedral and the Nuestra Señora de los Angeles Church in León. There are some examples were the Baroque also contains indigenous elements such as the San José Church in Irapuato and the San Agustin Monastery and Church in Yuriria. At the beginning of the 19th century, Baroque was giving way to Neoclassical. The [[Mexican War of Independence]] ended most major constructions, but in many churches in the state, Baroque altarpieces were replaced with Neoclassical ones. A few [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical constructions]] did manage to be built, mostly by [[Francisco Eduardo Tresguerras]] and include the [[obelisk]] monument to [[Charles IV of Spain]], the Del Carmen Church, The San Agustin Tower and the Dolores Chapel. Neoclassical works by others include the Entrance Arch of León, the [[Teatro Principal (Guanajuato)|Teatro Principal]] in Guanajuato and the Santiago Apostól Parish in Silao. From the 19th century on, trends became more modern with one notable exception. The Parish of San Miguel in San Miguel Allende had its facade redone by self-taught architect Zeferino Gutierrez. Working from only images from postcards of [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] cathedrals in Europe, Gutierrez created the imposing Gothic-like front, which is unique in the state.<ref name="r1314">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 13–14</ref>

The uniqueness of the state of Guanajuato even led Disney's [[Coco (2017 film)|Coco]] team to be inspired by the city. The colorful buildings all over Mexico gave the animators inspiration to bring the culture and heritage to the film. <ref>{{Cite news|last=Murphy|first=Mekado|date=2017-09-08|title=In 'Coco,' Bringing the Land of the Dead Back to Life|language=en-US|work=The New York Times|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/movies/coco-pixar-dia-de-los-muertos.html|access-date=2021-09-10|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

Guanajuato is home or place of origin of three important painters: [[Diego Rivera]], [[José Chávez Morado]] and [[Olga Costa]]. Rivera was born in the city of Guanajuato and spent his early childhood there. When he was older, he moved to Mexico City to study painting and eventually became one of Mexico's most famous muralists. José Chávez Morado was a prolific painter who lived and worked in the city of Guanajuato. He initially worked with [[José Clemente Orozco]], who impressed him both with art as well as politics. Chávez Morado's most prolific period was between 1955 and 1967, when he realized works in the [[University City of Mexico|Ciudad Universitaria]] in Mexico City, the [[Secretariat of Communications and Transportation (Mexico)|Secretariat of Communications and Transportation]] building in Mexico City and the [[Alhóndiga de Granaditas]] in his hometown. Olga Costa's real last name was Kostakowsky, but it was [[Hispanicization|Hispanicized]] to Costa. She was born in [[Leipzig]], Germany but she and her family moved to Mexico when she was very young.

Other artists include [[Manuel Leal]], whose works are mostly scenes from the state, [[Romualdo Garcia]], better known as a photographer than painter, [[Hermenegildo Bustos]], [[Hilario Gómez Sánchez]] and [[Luis Ferro Márquez]]. The state also produced one well-known sculptor by the name of [[Tomás Chávez Morado]], brother of José. His works can be seen at the Museo Regional de la Alhóndiga de Granaditas and the [[Museo del Caracol]] in Mexico City.<ref name="r1617">Jimenez Gonzalez, pp. 16–17</ref>

Ibargüengoitia was one of Mexico's most important writers of the 20th century, noted for his satirical works with social themes. Examples of his work include Los relámpagos de agosto, Los pasos de Lopez and Estas ruinas que ves. Ibáñez was a dramatist who was active in the second half of the 20th century. His best known work is Los caifanes, produced as a movie in 1966. Huerta began as a journalist and movie critic but his fame came as a poet.

About half of the state's municipalities have one or more institutions of higher education, with the most important being the [[University of Guanajuato]].<ref name="infraes"/> This university is in the city of Guanajuato, and began as a Jesuit school for children in the first half of the 18th century. The establishment of this school was sponsored by Josefa Teresa de Busto y Moya, sister of the Marquis of San Clemente, who obtained permission for the school from the [[Spanish Crown]] in 1732 and established the institution in her home. She donated a fifth of her fortune to it and worked to obtain donations from other wealthy families in the city.<ref name="r102">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 102</ref><ref name="stampart14">{{cite book |title= Guanajuato, Mexico |last=Leal G. |first=Manuel |year=2009 |publisher=Stampart |location=Guanajuato /Spanish |page=14}}</ref> Over time, the school grew and began to offer high school and professional level studies. It had several names over its history, from Real Colegio de la Purísima Concepción (1767), Colegio del Estado (1828), and Colegio Nacional de Guanajuato (1867) to its current name, adopted in 1945.<ref name="r102"/> The name "Colegio del Estado" was prompted by the fact that the institution became property of the state in 1828. In 1945, it gained university status.<ref name="stampart14"/>

Today the institution serves approximately 30,000 students at the high school, bachelor's and graduate levels. In addition to the main campus in the city, there are nine others in other parts of Guanajuato state. The university hosts a number of the events of the Festival Cervantino, with its famous stairway acting as seating.<ref name="r102"/> The institution's best-known facility is the main building in Guanajuato city, which was built in Neoclassical style in green stone. It houses the Dean's office, administrative offices and a number of the institution's departments.<ref name="stampart14"/> The main building is recognizable by its long staircase with 113 steps, which empties onto the Callejon del Estudiante. Under the main roof is a 16th-century chapel that was sponsored by [[Vasco de Quiroga]] for indigenous mine workers, the Templo de los Hospitales (Temple of the Hospitals). It is also the place that received the image of the Virgin of the Rosary, now called the Nuestra Señora de Guanajuato.<ref name="d3240"/><ref name="r103">Jimenez Gonzalez, p. 103</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Guanajuato subterráneo.jpg|thumb|A car and pedestrian pass in a tunnel under Guanajuato city]]
Guanajuato's highways directly connect to three of Mexico's ten major highways (Mexico City-Nuevo Laredo, Querétaro-[[Ciudad Juárez]] and Manzanillo-[[Tampico, Tamaulipas|Tampico]]). The state has 11,061&nbsp;km of highway, 5,281&nbsp;km of which are rural. It also has 1,249&nbsp;km of federal highways and 2,462 of state highways.<ref name="infraes"/> In July 2010, the state government of Guanajuato in Mexico awarded the 30-year concession of
the US$122 million Libramiento de Celaya toll road to consortium Concesionaria Bicentenario. The consortium will be responsible for constructing, operating and maintaining two highway sections. Work on the 12.9&nbsp;km Libramiento Nororiente stretch was scheduled to start in September 2010 and on the 16.5&nbsp;km Libramiento Sur stretch on August 9, 2010.<ref name="businfra">{{cite news |title= Mexico Infrastructure Report – Q4 2010 |newspaper= Mexico Infrastructure Report |location=London |date=2010 |pages=21–22}}</ref>

Like in the rest of Mexico, rail lines are almost exclusively used for the transportation of freight in the industrial areas of the state and, like the highway system, connects to most of the major national lines, with a total of 1,085&nbsp;km in the state. The most important line is the Empalme Escobedo in the municipalities of Comonfort, Acámbaro and Irapuato. In Celaya, there is a "ferropuerto" (rail-port), an installation on 57 hectares used to transfer 1 million tons of freight each year. The facility has customs and other offices to facilitates international shipments.<ref name="infraes"/>

The [[Guanajuato International Airport]], formerly the Bajío International Airport is located in the municipality of Silao between the cities of Silao and León. The airport currently serves ten airlines and serves many domestic and international destinations. There is one other airport in Celaya which serves domestic destinations as well as airfields in San Miguel Allende, [[Doctor Mora]], Irapuato, Manuel Doblado and San Francisco del Rincón.<ref name="infraes"/>

==Archeological sites==
[[File:Peralta.jpg|thumb|[[Peralta (Mesoamerican site)|Peralta]] archeological site]]
[[Chupícuaro (archeological site)|Chupícuaro]] is a site located in the south of the state on one side of the Lerma River. It is one of the older sites of Mesoamerica, having been active from 800&nbsp;BCE to 300&nbsp;CE and shows some of the earliest evidence of agriculture. The site has low flat rectangular platforms, with evidence of earlier structures below, which were probably the foundation of multigenerational houses; however most of the site is now under the waters of the Solís Dam.<ref name="trabajos"/> This site, along with some nearby contemporary sites, is known for its pottery called "Blanco Levantado", characterized with red and other colored lines on a light or cream background. This pottery has been shown to have elements in common with pottery in Zacatecas, other areas in northwest Mexico and even that of the [[Hohokam]] in [[Arizona]] and researchers believe that these people had trade relations that far north even finding [[turquoise]]. While the site has been extensively studied, it has also suffered looting, including some at the hands of Guanajuato authorities.<ref name="arqueomex"/>

Tierra Blanca is a large site which was a true city, not a ceremonial site, but most of the site had been sacked and practically destroyed when it fell and later as an archeological site although early photographs of it remain. There is evidence in Tula that this city, or one like it, had had significant influence on the Tula civilization. For this reason, the time span for Tierra Blanca is placed at before 950 CE although there is little evidence at the site itself to date it.<ref name="arqueomex"/>

[[Carabino]] is located in the northeast of the state. At this site items from and influenced by the city of Tula are found dating the city to about 900 to 1150&nbsp;CE. There is some evidence to suggest that the city was a colony of one of the cities of the center of Mexico. In Villa de Reyes in the far north in the Valley of San Luis, there also evidence of Toltec presence or influence. However, this later site was occupied first between 550 and 710 CE, then again in the Toltec era 200 to 300 years later. Evidence suggests that groups in these parts of Guanajuato had an effect on the organization of the [[Toltec Empire]] as settlements were abandoned sometime between 600 and 900&nbsp;CE. Through the Toltecs' influence in the [[Valley of Mexico]], Guanajuato cultures eventually had some influence on the much later Aztec.<ref name="arqueomex"/>

[[File:Plazuelas.JPG|thumb|One of the structures at the [[Plazuelas]] archeological site]]
[[Plazuelas]] is located just west of Pénjamo in the foothills of the Sierra de Pénjamo. The site, which is noted for the complexity of its architecture, was occupied during the first millennium of the Common Era with its height at around 600 to 900&nbsp;CE. The site was constructed over three hillsides separated by two large arroyos called Los Cuijes and Agua Nacida. The ethnicity of its occupants is not known nor is its original name. It appears to have been a theocracy with the elite inhabiting the hillsides and the rest of the population on flatter lands below. The most important construction at the site is the complex called Casas Tapadas, which contains several large structures and one [[Mesoamerican ball game|Mesoamerican ball court]].<ref name="d2223"/>

[[Peralta (Mesoamerican site)|Peralta]] is located on Abasolo, 21&nbsp;km from Pénjamo. It developed between 300 and 700&nbsp;CE, at the time that Teotihuacan was declining and Tula was rising. According to archeologists, the city declined and collapsed due to the [[overexploitation]] of the surrounding deciduous rainforest and it was abandoned around 900&nbsp;CE. The site occupies 150 hectares divided into a center with five surrounding settlements. The most important structure is called the "Patio Hundido" (Sunken Patio), whose name comes from the four pyramids that are at the corners. Another important building is the La Mesita (The Small Table) or Recinto de los Gobernantes (Governors' Precinct). It has a large plaza which is considered to have been the main square for the city. Among the walls and other structures a semicircle dedicated to the Danza de Voladores has been discovered.<ref name="d2324">Quintanar Hinajosa, pp. 23–24</ref>

[[Cañada de la Virgen]] contains a number of closely related architectonic complexes. Complex A, also called the Casa de los Trece Cielos (House of the Thirteen Heavens or Skies), consists of a large "sunken" patio like that in Peralta surrounded a pyramidal base over 25&nbsp;meters high and platforms that enclose the west, north and south sides. El Cóporo is situated on a small mountain and probably used by a group related to the Toltecs. It was at its height between 500 and 600&nbsp;CE. but abandoned by 900&nbsp;CE. It is a ceremonial center constructed of adobe and earth. One unique aspect of its construction is a series of columns which sink into the earth to a depth of about two and a half meters.<ref name="d25">Quintanar Hinajosa, p. 25</ref>
Other archeological sites in the state include Morales in San Miguel and [[El Cóporo]] in the northwest. The latter has figurines that show influence from groups in Zacatecas.<ref name="arqueomex"/>
