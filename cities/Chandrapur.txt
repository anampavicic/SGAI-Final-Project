'''Chandrapur''' (earlier known as ''Chanda'', the official name until 1964) is a [[city]] and a [[municipal corporation]] in [[Chandrapur district, Maharashtra]] state, India. It is the district headquarters of [[Chandrapur district]]. Chandrapur is a fort city founded by Khandkya Ballal Shah, a [[Gond kingdom|Gond king]] of the 13th century.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Deogaonkar|first1=Shashishekhar|title=The Gonds of Vidarbha|publisher=Concept Publishing Company, 2007|isbn=978-8180694745|pages=37|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X39c2VODLT0C&q=King+Surja+gond+king&pg=PA37|year=2007}}</ref> The city sits at the confluence of the Erai river and Zarpat river.

==Etymology==
The local people relate the name "Chandrapur" to the words ''[[Chandra]]'' (the moon) and ''pur'' (a settlement) after a legend. Scholars see the name as a derivative of "Indupur" (city of the moon) which stood near the Jharpat in the Treta Yuga.

==History==
There are many Stone Age sites in Chandrapur District. Suresh Chopane, a renowned researcher, found many stone-age tools in the district, which has been displayed in his Rock Museum. Archeological finds, such as signs of pottery making, suggest inhabitation of the Chandrapur area in [[Neolithic]] times.<ref>{{cite book|author1-link=John N. Miksic|last1=Miksic|first1=John|title=Earthenware in Southeast Asia: Proceedings of the Singapore Symposium|date=2003|publisher=NUS Press|isbn=9971692716}}</ref>

From ancient times, Chandrapur has fallen under the control of many different rulers. Between 322 BCE and 187 BCE, much of India, including Maharashtra, was part of the [[Maurya Empire]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=William|title=Chandragupta Maurya and his times|date=1966|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=9788120804050}}</ref> From 187 BCE to 78 BCE, Chandrapur was part of the [[Shunga Empire]] which controlled much of central and eastern India.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thapar|first1=Romila|title=Early India|date=2004|publisher=University of California press|location=Los Angeles|isbn=9780520242258|page=[https://archive.org/details/earlyindiafromor00thap/page/2010 2010]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/earlyindiafromor00thap/page/2010}}</ref> The [[Satavahana Empire]] controlled Chandrapur from the 1st century BCE to the 2nd century CE.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Dutt|first1=Sukumar|title=Buddhist Monks and Monasteries|date=1988|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=9788120804982|page=123}}</ref> The [[Vakataka dynasty]] ruled from the area from the mid 3rd century CE to 550 CE.<ref>Majumdar R.C.

The Gond people are part of the [[Adivasi]] (indigenous people) of India. In ancient times, the Gond diaspora spread throughout central India. After the passage of many kings, who were largely subservient to other rulers, the Gond king, Khandkya Ballal (1470 {{ndash}} 1495) came to the throne. He founded Chandrapur.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kingdoms of South Asia|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsFarEast/IndiaGondwana.htm|website=The History Files|access-date=12 December 2017}}</ref>

As per legends, Khandkya, who resided in [[Sirpur (T)|Sirpur]], was covered in tumours. His wise and beautiful wife nursed him. She asked him to leave Sirpur and move to the north bank of the [[Wardha River]]. There, the king built a fort he named "Ballalpur" and thus founded the city of [[Ballarpur]]. In the year of 1262, one day while hunting northwest of Ballalpur, the king became thirsty and rode up to the dry bed of the Jharpat river in search of water. He discovered water trickling from a hole, and after drinking, washed his face, hands and feet. That night, he slept soundly for the first time in his life.

On his return, the queen was delighted to see that many of the tumours on her husband's body had disappeared. The king said it was the water that had cured him and took his wife to see the water hole. On clearing the grass and sand, they found five footprints of a cow in the solid rock, each filled with water. The water source at the spot was inexhaustible and considered holy. The place was called "Tirtha of Acalesvar of the Treta Yuga". When the king bathed in the water, all the tumours on his body vanished. That night at the water hole, Acalesvar appeared to the king in a dream and spoke comforting words. A temple was built over the water hole.

One morning, at the water hole, the king saw a hare darting out of a bush and chasing his dog. Eventually, the dog killed the hare. The king found a white spot on the forehead of the hare. The queen said it was a good omen and a fortified city should be built with its layout based on the chase of the dog and hare. She said the place where the hare was killed would be unlucky for the city. The king's officers, the "Tel Thakurs" built the fortified city. The city became Chandrapur.

Chandrapur was taken over by Nagpur Bhonsles in 1751 during the [[Maratha empire]] period. The last ruler of the Maratha dynasty, [[Raghuji Bhonsle III]] died in 1853 without issue. In 1853, Chandrapur was annexed to British India. During the British colonial period, the area of Chandrapur was called "Chanda". By 1871, [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] and [[Scottish Episcopal Church|Scottish Episcopal]] missionaries had arrived in the city.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Strong|first1=Rowan|title=Episcopalianism in Nineteenth-Century Scotland|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199249220|page=31}}</ref> In 1874, three [[tehsil]]s were created: Viz Mul, Warora and Bramhpuri. The upper Godavai district of [[Madras]] was abolished and four tehsils were added to Chandrapur to form one tehsil with [[Sironcha]], approximately 150&nbsp;km to the south, as its centre of governance. In 1895, the headquarters was transferred to Chandrapur. In 1905, a new tehsil with headquarters at [[Gadchiroli]] was created through the transfer of [[zamindar]]i estates from Bramhpuri and Chandrapur tehsil. In 1907, a small area of land was transferred from Chandrapur to the newer districts and another area of about 1560&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, comprising three divisions of the lower Sironcha tehsil (Cherla, Albak and Nugir) were transferred to Madras State. Between 1911 and 1955, no major changes occurred in the boundaries of the district or its tehsils.

In 1956, with the reorganization of Indian states, Chandrapur district was transferred from [[Madhya Pradesh]] to [[Bombay state]]. In 1959, part of [[Adilabad district]] of [[Hyderabad state]], was transferred to Chandrapur district. In May 1960, Chandrapur district became part of the [[Maharashtra state]]. In 1964, the city was renamed to Chandrapur. Following the 1981 Census of India, Chandrapur district was divided into Chandrapur district and [[Gadchiroli district]].
