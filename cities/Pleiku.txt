'''Pleiku''' is a city in central [[Vietnam]], located in the [[Central Highlands (Vietnam)|Central Highlands]] region. It is the capital of the [[Gia Lai Province]]. Many years ago, it was inhabited primarily by the [[Bahnar people|Bahnar]] and [[Jarai people|Jarai]] ethnic groups, sometimes known as the Montagnards or [[Degar]], although now it is inhabited primarily by the [[Vietnamese people|Kinh]] ethnic group. The city is the centre of the urban district of Pleiku which covers an area of 260.77&nbsp;km² (100 mi²).

As of 2023, the city has a population of around 274.018 people.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pleiku (District-level City, Gia Lai, Vietnam) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/vietnam/admin/gia_lai/622__pleiku/ |access-date=2024-02-07 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref>

== Name ==
The name "'''Pleiku'''" first appeared in the '''[[List of governors-general of French Indochina|Governor-General of French Indochina]]''' records in 1905, in the decree that established the province of Gia Lai. The Decree of the [[List of governors-general of French Indochina|Governor-General of Indochina]] dated July 4, 1905, established an autonomous province in the western mountainous region of [[Bình Định province|Binh Dinh]] province, naming it "'''Plei-Kou-Derr'''". This marked the first official use of the name "Plei-Kou" in writing.

The word "'''Plơi'''" means "village" in [[Jarai people|Jarai]], while "'''Kơdưr'''" can mean either "north" or "upper". Therefore, the name "'''Pleiku'''" can be translated as "upper village" or "village in the north".

The word "'''Derr'''" is likely a [[Jarai people|Jarai]] word that was added to the name "'''Pleiku'''" by the French to distinguish it from other villages in the area. The name "'''Pleiku'''" has been used since the colonial period and is still the official name of the city today.

==History==

=== First Indochina War ===
At the end of the [[First Indochina War]], in June 1954, the [[French Army]] ''Groupe Mobile 100'' was ordered to fall back from [[An Khê District|An Khê]] to Pleiku and then to reopen Route Coloniale 14 between Pleiku and [[Buôn Ma Thuột]]. This led to the last battle of the war: the [[Battle of Mang Yang Pass]].

=== Second Indochina War ===

Pleiku was strategically important during the [[Vietnam War]] because it was the primary terminus of the military supply logistics corridor extending westwards along Highway 19 from the coastal population centre and port facilities of [[Qui Nhơn]]. Additionally, its central location on the plateau, between Kon Tum to the North, [[Buôn Ma Thuột]] to the south, and the [[North Vietnamese Army]]'s base areas inside [[Cambodia]] to the west made Pleiku the main centre of defense of the entire highland region of the [[Republic of Vietnam]]. This was obvious to both sides; the [[United States]] established an armed presence very early in the conflict at [[Camp Holloway]], and the [[Viet Cong attack on Pleiku airbase|Việt Cộng attack]] on this base in early 1965 was one of the key escalating events that brought U.S. troops into the conflict.<ref>Karnow, Stanley. ''Vietnam: A History'', New York: Penguin Books, (1984), p. 428, {{ISBN|0670842184}}</ref>

On 15 June 1972, [[Cathay Pacific Flight 700Z bombing|Cathay Pacific Flight 700Z]], operating a [[Convair 880]] (VR-HFZ) from Bangkok to Hong Kong, disintegrated and crashed while the aircraft was flying at 29,000 feet (8,800 m) over Pleiku, Vietnam after a bomb exploded in a suitcase placed under a seat in the cabin, killing all 81 people on board.

{{main|Ho Chi Minh Campaign}}
After the fall of Buôn Ma Thuột to a major North Vietnamese assault in early 1975, and the resulting insecurity of [[National Route 19 (Vietnam)|National Route 19]] leading from [[Qui Nhơn]], the president, [[Nguyễn Văn Thiệu]], ordered the hasty evacuation of Pleiku. The military operation to attempt the withdrawal of ARVN forces, down the poorly maintained tertiary road LTL-7B through [[Ayun Pa]] to [[Tuy Hòa]], led to a catastrophe in which over 100,000 evacuees from Pleiku and Kon Tum were killed or left stranded without support. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}
