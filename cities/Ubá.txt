==History==

===Settlement===
The [[Pomba River]] basin settlement took place, initially, due to the decline of mining activities. In the late 18th and early 19th century, several families left [[Mariana, Minas Gerais|Mariana]], [[Ouro Preto]], and other [[mining]] centers in search of fertile land where they could undertake activities that would result in a more stable and secure incoming. The regions bathed by the Itajaí River, Chopotó River, Pomba River, among others, were of great interest because the land in those areas were of great fertility, and that they were previously inhabited only by natives ([[Coroado]]s, [[Coropó]]s and [[Purí]]s) and adventurers.

The attempts of colonization of Coroados, Coropós, Purís and [[Botocudo]]s always ended in bloody battles between the indigenous people and the colonizers. During the battles, using arrows and axes against firearms, the natives were gradually slaughtered or made prisoners for slave labor, especially when it comes to young people and women.

Due to the international pressure against the genocide of natives, the King of Portugal was convinced to order the Governor [[Luís Diogo Lobo da Silva]] to organize an expedition in an attempt to friendly approach the natives. In November 1767, Father [[Manoel de Jesus Maria]] was put in charge for the conversion of the natives to Catholicism, laying the groundwork for the entry of the owners of land grants after 1797. [[Captain Francisco Pires de Farinho]], who was familiar with the tracks of forests and the indigenous customs, and was familiar with them, was named special guide with control power.

Father Jesus Maria arrived at [[Uba River]], where the Coroado natives lived. Those natives used a kind of grass, [[Gynerium sagittatum]] (in Portuguese, U-Uva), to make the arrows they used. For linguistic evolution U-Uva became Ubá. Between 1797 and 1798, the first land grants located around the river were donated.

In 1805, Captain [[Antonio Januário Carneiro]] and his brother-in-law Commander Jose de Faria Alvim Cesario, acquired several land grants previously belonging to the [[Visconde do Rio Branco|Municipality of São João Batista do Presídio]], bringing their families, slaves and livestock. In this period, according to an agreement between the [[Holy See|Vatican]] and the [[Catholic Monarchs]], when a settlement in the colonies was founded, a church was to be the first building to be built. While the former owners of land were concerned about their farms, Antonio Januário Carneiro idealized establish a settlement. His first step was to lead a movement to sign the petition requesting the permit for the construction of the church. On November 3, 1815, the request was granted.

To promote this settlement, Captain Januário Carneiro brought all the workers needed to build the church by giving them small pieces of land, housing and food, while they could not have its own supply by cultivating the land. The [[chapel]] received the name of [[St. Januarius]], and the village the name of Capela de São Januário de Ubá (Chapel of St. Januarius of Ubá).

Due to the growth of the village, it was elevated to Paróquia de São Januário de Ubá (Parish of St. Januarius of Ubá) on April 7, 1841. The development of the town took place gradually around the parish. Due to the development of the parish and the activities of the inhabitants, especially coffee plantations, the settlement was officially recognized as a village on June 17, 1853, and on July 3, 1857, was incorporated as a municipality.

The first [[city council]] was composed by:

*Colonel Francisco de Assis Ataíde
*Pedro de Souza Ozório
*Maximiano José Pereira de Souza
*Joaquim Vieira da Silva Pinto
*Manoel de Oliveira da Silva Brandão
*Diogo da Rocha Bastos
