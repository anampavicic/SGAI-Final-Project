[[File:Periplous of the Erythraean Sea.svg|left|thumbnail|Names, routes and locations of the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' (1st century CE)]]
As the ancient city of Quilon, Kollam was a flourishing port during the [[Pandya dynasty]] (c. 3rd century BC–12th century), and later became the capital of the independent [[Venad]] or the Kingdom of Quilon on its foundation in c. 825. Kollam was considered one of the four early [[entrepot]]s in global sea trade during the 13th century, along with Alexandria and Cairo in Egypt, the Chinese city of [[Quanzhou]], and [[Malacca]] in the Malaysian archipelago.<ref name=Tignor>{{cite book|last=tignor|first=Robert|title=Worlds together, worlds apart: a history of the world from the beginnings of humankind to the present|year=2010|publisher=W.W.

===Pandya rule===
The ancient political and cultural history of Kollam was almost entirely independent from that of the rest of Kerala. The [[Chera dynasty]] governed the area of Malabar Coast between [[Alappuzha]] in the south to [[Kasaragod]] in the north. This included [[Palakkad Gap]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]], and [[Kolli Hills]]. The region around [[Coimbatore]] was ruled by the Cheras during [[Sangam period]] between c. first and the fourth centuries CE and it served as the eastern entrance to the Palakkad Gap, the principal trade route between the Malabar Coast and [[Tamil Nadu]].<ref name="Trade">{{cite news|last=Subramanian|first=T.

Along with ([[Muziris]] and [[Tyndis]]), Quilon was an ancient seaport on the Malabar Coast of India from the early centuries before the Christian era. Kollam served as a major port city for [[Pandya dynasty]] on the western coast while [[Kulasekharapatnam]] served Pandyas on the eastern coast. The city had a high commercial reputation from the days of the [[Phoenicians]] and [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]]. [[Pliny the Elder]] (23–79 AD) mentions [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] ships anchored at Muziris and [[Nelcynda]]. There was also a land route over the [[Western Ghats]]. Spices, pearls, diamonds, and silk were exported to [[Egypt]] and Rome from these ports. Pearls and diamonds came to the Chera Kingdom from [[Ceylon]] and the southeastern coast of India, then known as the [[Pandyan Kingdom]].

He writes, "In the island of Tabropane (Ceylon), there is a church of Christians, and clerics and faithful.

The port at Kollam, then known as Quilon, was founded in 825 by the Nestorian Christians [[Mar Sabor and Mar Proth]] with sanction from Ayyanadikal Thiruvadikal, the king of the independent Venad or the State of Quilon, a feudatory under the [[Chera dynasty|Chera]] kingdom.<ref>Kerala Charithram P.59 Sridhara Menon</ref><ref name="Travancore Manual page 244">V.

It is believed that Mar Sapor Iso also proposed that the Chera king create a new seaport near Kollam in lieu of his request that he rebuild the almost vanished inland seaport at Kollam (kore-ke-ni) near Backare (Thevalakara), also known as Nelcynda and Tyndis to the Romans and Greeks and as Thondi to the Tamils, which had been without trade for several centuries because the Cheras were overrun by the [[Pallava dynasty|Pallavas]] in the sixth century, ending the spice trade from the Malabar coast. This allowed the Nestorians to stay in the Chera kingdom for several decades and introduce the Christian faith among the Nampoothiri Vaishnavites and Nair sub-castes in the St. Thomas tradition, with the Syrian liturgy as a basis for the Doctrine of the Trinity, without replacing the Sanskrit and Vedic prayers.<ref>History of Kollam city and Kollam Port [http://www.quilon.com/history.htm Quilon.com]</ref> The [[Tharisapalli plates]] presented to Maruvan Sapor Iso by Ayyanadikal Thiruvadikal granted the Christians the privilege of overseeing foreign trade in the city as well as control over its weights and measures in a move designed to increase Quilon's trade and wealth.{{sfnp|Malekandathil|2010}}<ref name="Sharma2010">{{cite book|author=Yogesh Sharma|title=Coastal Histories: Society and Ecology in Pre-modern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FTTGWSme30YC|year=2010|publisher=Primus Books|page=78|isbn=978-93-80607-00-9}}</ref> The two Christians were also instrumental in founding Christian churches with Syrian liturgy along the Malabar coast, distinct from the ancient Vedic Advaitam propounded by Adi Shankara in the early ninth century among the Nampoothiri Vaishnavites and [[Nair]] Sub Castes, as Malayalam was not accepted as a liturgical language until the early 18th century.

Thus began the Malayalam Era, known as Kolla Varsham after the city, indicating the importance of Kollam in the ninth century.{{sfnp|Malekandathil|2010}} The Persian merchant Soleyman of Siraf visited Malabar in the ninth century and found Quilon to be the only port in India used by the huge Chinese ships as their transshipment hub for goods on their way from China to the Persian Gulf. The rulers of Kollam (formerly called 'Desinganadu') had trade relations with China and exchanged embassies. According to the records of the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–913),<ref>Travancore Manual, page 244</ref> Quilon was their chief port of call before the seventh century. The Chinese trade decreased about 600 and was again revived in the 13th century. ''Mirabilia Descripta'' by Bishop Catalani gives a description of life in Kollam, which he saw as the Catholic bishop-designate to Kollam, the oldest Catholic diocese in India. He also gives<ref>Mirabilia Descripta by Jordanus Catalani circa 1320–1336 (trans Hiracut Society, London)</ref> true and imaginary descriptions of life in 'India the Major' in the period before [[Marco Polo]] visited the city. Sulaiman al-Tajir, a Persian merchant who visited Kerala during the reign of [[Sthanu Ravi Varma]] (9th century CE), records that there was extensive trade between Kerala and China at that time, based at the port of Kollam.<ref>{{Cite book|title=India Charitram|last=Menon|first=A.

In the 13th century CE, [[Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I]], a [[Pandya dynasty|Pandya]] ruler fought a war in Venad and captured the city of Kollam.<ref>KA Nilakanta Sastri, p197</ref> The city appears on the [[Catalan Atlas]] of 1375 CE as Columbo and Colobo. The map marks this city as a Christian city, ruled by a Christian ruler.<ref name="VL4"/>

The text above the picture of the king says:

{{blockquote|''Açí seny[o]reja lo rey Colobo, christià. Pruvíncia de Columbo''<br>(Here reigns the Lord King Colobo, Christian, Province of Columbo).<ref name="VL4"/>}}

The city was much frequented by the Genoese merchants during the 13th-14th centuries CE, followed by the Dominican and Franciscan friars from Europe. The Genoese merchants called the city Colõbo/Colombo.

The city was founded in 825 by Maruvān Sapir Iso, a Persian [[East Syriac Christian]] merchant, and was also Christianized early by the [[Saint Thomas Christians]]. In 1329 CE [[Pope John XXII]] established Kollam / Columbo as the first and only Roman Catholic bishopric on the Indian subcontinent, and appointed [[Jordan Catala|Jordan of Catalonia]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friar, as the diocese's first bishop of the Latin sect.<ref name="VL4"/> The Pope's Latin scribes assigned the name "Columbum" to Columbo.

According to a book authored by Ilarius Augustus, published April, 2021 ('''Christopher Columbus: Buried deep in Latin the Indian origin of the great explorer from Genoa''<nowiki/>'), the words Columbum, Columbus and Columbo appear for the first time in a notarial deed (lease contract) of a certain Mousso in Genoa in 1329 CE. These words appear in the form of a [[wiktionary:toponym|toponym]]. The author then shows, through the Latin text of several other notarial deeds and the documents on church history, how [[Christopher Columbus]] - also carrying the same [[wiktionary:toponym|toponym]].- was part of Mousso's family, and hence of the [[Origin theories of Christopher Columbus#Genoese birth - Indian lineage hypothesis|Indian lineage]] (although born in Genoa).

===Kozhikode Influences===
The port at [[Kozhikode]] held superior economic and political position in medieval Kerala coast, while [[Kannur]], Kollam, and [[Kochi]], were commercially important secondary ports, where the traders from various parts of the world would gather.<ref name="Malekandathil">''The Portuguese, Indian Ocean and European Bridgeheads 1500–1800''.

===Travancore Rule===
In the early 18th century CE, the [[Travancore royal family]] adopted some members from the royal family of [[Kolathunadu]] based at [[Kannur]], and [[Parappanad]] based in present-day [[Malappuram district]].<ref>Travancore State Manual</ref> Later, Venad Kingdom was completely merged with the [[Kingdom of Travancore]] during the rein of [[Marthanda Varma]] and Kollam remained as the capital of Travancore Kingdom. Later on, the capital of Travancore was relocated to Thiruvananthapuram.

Kollam is an ancient trading town – trading with Romans, Chinese, Arabs, and other Orientals – mentioned in historical citations dating back to Biblical times and the reign of Solomon, connecting with Red Sea ports of the Arabian Sea (supported by a find of ancient Roman coins).<ref>{{cite web|title=The legendary beauty of Kollam|date=28 June 2023 |url=http://www.financialexpress.com/story-print/1159603}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of Kollam|url=http://paru.in/history-of-kollam|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602135640/http://paru.in/history-of-kollam|archive-date=2 June 2015}}</ref> There was also internal trade through the [[Aryankavu|Aryankavu Pass]] in [[Sengottai|Schenkottah Gap]] connecting the ancient town to Tamil Nadu. The overland trade in pepper by bullock cart and the trade over the waterways connecting [[Allepey]] and Cochin established trade linkages that enabled it to grow into one of the earliest Indian industrial townships. The rail links later established to Tamil Nadu supported still stronger trade links. The factories processing marine exports and the processing and packaging of cashewnuts extended its trade across the globe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kollam Tourism - Official Website|url=http://www.kollamtourism.com/history.html/|access-date=6 January 2014}}</ref> It is known for [[cashew]] processing and [[coir]] manufacturing. Ashtamudi Lake is considered the southern gateway to the backwaters of Kerala and is a prominent tourist destination at Kollam. The Kollam urban area includes suburban towns such as Paravur in the south, [[Kundara]] in the east and [[Karunagapally]] in the north of the city. Other important towns in the city suburbs are [[Eravipuram]], [[Kottiyam]], Kannanallur, and [[Chavara]].

===Climate===
