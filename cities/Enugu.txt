==History==

===Early history===



Énugwú is the capital city of Enugu State in Nigeria. It is located in southeastern part of Nigeria.  The name Enugu is derived from the two Igbo words Énú Ụ́gwụ́, meaning "hill top", denoting the city's hilly geography. Enugu acquired township status in 1917 and was called Enugwu-Ngwo, but because of the rapid expansion towards areas owned by other indigenous communities, the city was renamed Enugu in 1928.

The first settlement in the Enugu area was the small Nike village of Ogui from present day Igala  which was present since the era of the [[Atlantic Slave Trade]].<ref name="town">Udo, p. 88.</ref> ''Nike'' in the Igbo language means "with strength or power".<ref name="cap">Williams, p. 196.</ref> The Nike people acquired most of their lands through [[slave raiding]], as the area was mostly unsettled. The Nike people used slaves as part of their defence strategy. They placed Slave camps at the edge of their territories so that it was harder for an enemy to access the free-born people.<ref>Udo, p. 92.</ref> 

The Nike were allied to the [[Aro people]], who formed the [[Aro Confederacy]] (1690–1901).<ref>{{cite journal|title=The Evolution of the Aro Confederacy in Southeastern Nigeria, 1690–1720: A Theoretical Synthesis of State Formation Process in Africa |first=Apollos |last=Nwauwa |journal=Anthropos |issue=4–6 |publisher=Anthropos Institute |year=1995 |volume=90 |pages=353–364 |issn=0257-9774}}</ref> This Igbo organisation controlled slave trading in the Enugu area.<ref>{{cite journal |journal=Africa |volume=24 |issue=4 |title=The Ohu System of Slavery in a Northern Ibo Village Group |first=W.R.G. |last=Horton |year=1954 |pages=311–336 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press | doi = 10.2307/1156711 |jstor=1156711 |s2cid=144896811 }}</ref> 

Numerous Aro people came to trade from [[Arochukwu]] in the south; the [[Hausa people]] came to trade from the north. The Hausa traders provided horses to the Nike, who used them for Igbo rituals. Both the Aro and Hausa regularly migrated back and forth to what is now the city of Enugu, and were considered foreigners to the area.<ref name=history>{{cite web|title=Explaining Inter-Ethnic Coexistence and Harmony in Enugu city, Southeastern Nigeria |first=Akachi Cornelius |last=Odoemene |publisher=University of Ibadan |pages=6–8 |url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:1alpOUdSuSAJ:iussp2009.princeton.edu/download.aspx%3FsubmissionId%3D90623+Explaining+Inter-Ethnic+Coexistence+and+Harmony+in+Enugu+city,+Southeastern+Nigeria&hl=en&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESgfS7i6J5YxEHceZG9ZdYv4g-HjZ0RCwIB9FM-Vpduh8FvNUlYWg1i3wI35yKyQMX7UIMcLfOqdeP4VfHoq4mAbwHgRo-R3cI2sVQ_QQOggYXkYwXEExnHv_mizVboLDEc03SFo&sig=AHIEtbTZa9w6FJWeoGADzwaG2fxd2m4y9g}}</ref>

===Industrialisation===
{{See also|Colonial Nigeria}}
[[File:Iva Valley coal mine.jpg|thumb|alt=A picture of the Iva Valley coal mine from 2006.|The Iva Valley coal mine]]
A British campaign to invade Arochukwu and open up the hinterland for British military and political rule was carried out in 1901. A war between the British and Aro officially started on 1 December 1901; it lasted until 24 March 1902 when the Aro were defeated.<ref>{{cite book|title=Missionary enterprise and rivalry in Igboland, 1857–1914 |first=Felix K. |last=Ekechi |pages=123–125 |publisher=Routledge |year=1972 |isbn=978-0-7146-2778-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WNwgU_0wQukC&pg=PA123}}</ref> 

The Aro Confederacy ended, and the British added the rest of Aro-dominated areas to The Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, declared in 1900.<ref>{{cite book|title=The school in the service of evangelization: the Catholic educational impact in eastern Nigeria, 1886–1950 |first=Nicholas Ibeawuchi |last=Omenka |pages=112–115 |publisher=BRILL, 1989 |isbn=978-90-04-08632-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qYQEUH--BO0C&pg=PA112|year=1989 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Oil, democracy, and the promise of true federalism in Nigeria |first1=Augustine A. |last1=Ikein |first2=Diepreye S.

Europeans first arrived in the Enugu area in 1903 when the British/Australian [[geologist]] [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] led an exploration of the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]] to search for especially valued mineral resources under the supervision of the [[Commonwealth Institute|Imperial Institute, London]]. By 1909 they found coal under the village of Enugwu Ngwo<ref name="cap"/> in the Udi area.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Baiyewu-Teru |first=Abiodun |title=HISTORY: The History of Coal in Nigeria |url=https://ng.boell.org/en/2015/12/03/history-history-coal-nigeria}}</ref> By 1913 the coal was confirmed to be in quantities that would be viable commercially.<ref name=history/> 

By 1914 the colonial government had merged the [[Northern Nigeria Protectorate|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Nigeria Protectorate to form the [[Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Nigeria, background to nationalism |first=James S. |last=Coleman |page=43 |publisher=University of California Press |year=1971 |isbn=978-0-520-02070-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2MTI-Y3tzkAC&pg=PA43}}</ref>

In 1915 the British began talks with the indigenous people of the land that would become Enugu about its acquisition in order to lay the Eastern Line railway and to build a colliery. The first houses built in the area were in a temporary settlement consisting of Igbo traditional mud housing inhabited by a W. J. Leck and some other Europeans on Hill-top. This was the only plain on the escarpment rolling before the jungled Milliken Hill. Historic former residences of the colonialists, known as the "Europeans quarters", still survive on the Hill-top. It is now an outskirt of Enugwu-Ngwo town. 

As a result of industrialization, settlements sprang up in the area now known as Enugu. The settlement known as ''Ugwu Alfred'' (Igbo: Alfred's Hill) or "Alfred's Camp", was developed on a hillside and inhabited by Alfred Inoma (a leader of indigenous Coal labourers from [[Onitsha]]) and his labourers.<ref name=history/><ref name="townhist">{{cite book|title=Management of environmental problems and hazards in Nigeria |first=H.

After the British acquired land here, [[Frederick Lugard]], the [[List of Governors-General of Nigeria|Governor-General of Nigeria]] at the time, named the colliery built at the bottom of the Udi Hills as ''Enugu Coal Camp'' to distinguish it from Enugwu Ngwo<ref name="cap"/> which overlooks the city from atop a scarp to the west of Enugu.<ref>{{cite book|title=Eastern Nigeria: a geographical review |first=Barry |last=Floyd |page=282 |publisher=Praeger |year=1969}}</ref>

Enugu became one of the few cities in [[West Africa]] created explicitly from contact with Europeans.<ref name="town"/> By 1916 the colonial government designated parts of Enugu as reserved for Europeans. The area now known as the Government Reserved Area (GRA) was called the European Quarters, located north of the Ogbete River. To the south of the river was a section developed for African residents. The built-up area of Enugu comprised these two areas, and by 1917 the city officially gained township status. On the African side of the city, a rapid influx of migrant workers led to the development of squatter camps on the Udi Hills near the coal mines and the Iva Valley.<ref name="townhist"/>

In 1929, Enugu became the administrative headquarters for the Southern Province under the post-World War II constitutions. With this, the number of government departments represented in the town increased tremendously.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Okezie |first=Anthony |title=From labour settlement to cosmopolitan city: Dynamics of migration and urbanisation in Enugu's development, 1915-1990 |url=https://ipc2009.popconf.org/papers/90621}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Explaining inter-ethnic harmony in Enugu city, South-eastern Nigeria 1970 – 2003 |url=https://www.accord.org.za/ajcr-issues/explaining-inter-ethnic-harmony-in-enugu-city-south-eastern-nigeria/ }}</ref> In 1938 Enugu became the administrative capital of the [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]].

=== Water ===
Water, until recently, was a scarce resource in Enugu. Drilling of borehole in the city is usually an exercise in futility because of the geological formation which has coal large deposits of coal underground. The residents got water by buying from commercial water tanker drivers, digging water wells and harvesting and storing rain water. However, the Enugu State government under the Peter Mbah administration in November 2023 completed a major water scheme at 9th Mile Corner Ngwo, increasing the daily water production from an occasional 2 liters to 70 million liters, with the Oji River water scheme expected to add another 50 liters daily, bringing the total to 120 million liters daily. Reticulation of water to the various buildings remains a challenge, though being continuously addressed by the administration, as aged asbestos pipes are being replaced with modern ductile pipes.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-11-26 |title=Enugu begins pumping of 70m litres as Mbah commissions water scheme |url=https://thenationonlineng.net/enugu-begins-pumping-of-70m-litres-as-mbah-commissions-water-scheme// |access-date=2024-04-18 |website=The Nation News |language=en-GB}}</ref>
