The modern city of Grodno, founded in 1127, originated as a small fortress and trading outpost on the border of the Baltic tribal union of the [[Yotvingians]].<ref name=zetgr/> It was also a home to the [[Dregoviches]] Slavic tribe.<ref name=zetgr/> It was a significant city in Black Ruthenia and later part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], which joined the [[Polish-Lithuanian Union]] in 1385. Grodno faced numerous invasions, most notably by the [[Teutonic Knights]]. The city was a key trade, commerce, and cultural center in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]], and one of its royal residences, and ''[[de facto]]'' capital in the 1580s. The grand dukes allowed the creation of a Jewish commune in 1389, and the city received its charter in 1441. Grodno was the site of two battles during the [[Great Northern War]].

Grodno has a rich history with various rulers and influences. In 1793, Grodno became the capital of the Grodno Voivodeship, but was annexed by Russia in 1795 after [[Third Partition of Poland]]. The city had a significant Jewish population before the Holocaust. After WWI, it was briefly part of the Belarusian People's Republic and the Republic of Lithuania before being taken over by Poland. During WWII, it was occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] and later by [[Nazi Germany]]. Since 1945, Grodno has been part of Belarus. Today, it has a diverse population, including Belarusians, Poles, and a small Jewish community. The city is known for its historical architecture, including the [[Old Grodno Castle]], and is a center for Roman Catholicism and Polish culture in Belarus.

Before arrival of the [[East Slavs]] to the [[Grodno Region]] in the 10th–11th centuries, the area was inhabited by [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe [[Yotvingians]], who were heavily [[Lithuanization|Lithuanized]] in the 5th-7th centuries already and especially during the formation of the State of [[Lithuania]] in the 13th century, and subsequently for a long time Grodno and its area was a part of the [[Ethnographic Lithuania]] (e.g. even in the 19th century the Lithuanian-inhabited areas were still nearby the present-day suburbs of Grodno city).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Vidugiris |first1=Aloyzas |title=Gardino sritis |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/gardino-sritis/ |website=[[Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija]] |access-date=22 June 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> The modern city of Grodno originated as a small fortress and a fortified trading outpost maintained by the [[Rurikid]] [[prince]]s on the border with the lands of the Baltic tribal union of the Yotvingians. The first reference to Grodno dates to 1005.<ref name="USSR/1965">[https://books.google.com/books?id=4HziAAAAMAAJ  ''Археографический ежегодник за 1964 год''.] The Academy of Sciences of the USSR, 1965, pg. 271. The name derives from the [[Old East Slavic]] verb ''gorodit'', i.e., ''to enclose, to fence'' (see "[[Grad (geography)|grad]]" for details) or [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] 'gardas', i.e., "a fence" (see [https://www.lietuviuzodynas.lt/zodynas/Gardas Lithuanian language dictionary] for details), both from an old [[Indo-European]] [https://etimologija.baltnexus.lt/?w=gardas word].</ref>

The official foundation year is 1128. In this year Grodno was mentioned in the ''[[Kievan Chronicle]]'' as '''Goroden''',{{sfn|Heinrich|1977|p=11}} and located at a crossing of numerous trading routes.{{Citation needed|date=September 2023}} The same chronicle also reports in the year 1183: 'That same year all of Goroden burned, including all the stone churches, from a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder in a thunderstorm.'{{sfn|Heinrich|1977|p=401}} 

Grodno became part of the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] in the 13th century, and the local stronghold was rebuilt by Lithuanians.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=4}} Prince [[Daniel of Galicia]] briefly captured the city in 1253 and once again attacked it in 1259.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=4}} In 1276, Duke [[Traidenis]] gave shelter in Grodno to Yotvingians fleeing the [[Teutonic Knights]]' massacre.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=4}} The city was unsuccessfully attacked by the Rus' princes and Tatars in 1277, then repeatedly attacked, with varying success, by the Teutonic Knights in 1283, 1296, 1306, 1311, 1312, 1328, 1361, 1363, 1373, 1375, 1377.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|pp=5–6}} In 1358 a convention took place in Grodno on border disputes between Lithuania and the Polish [[Duchy of Masovia]].{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=6}}

Since 1385 Grodno formed part of the [[Polish–Lithuanian union]]. The famous Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Vytautas]] was the prince of Grodno from 1376 to 1392, and he stayed there during his preparations for the [[Battle of Grunwald]] (1410). During the [[Lithuanian Civil War (1389–1392)|Lithuanian Civil War of 1389–1392]], the city was captured by [[Władysław II Jagiełło]] in 1390, and then by Vytautas in 1391, with Vytautas-allied [[Konrad von Wallenrode]] committing a massacre of 15 Polish prisoners-of-war.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=7}} After the [[Ostrów Agreement]] of 1392, Vytautas expelled the Teutonic Knights, who in revenge captured the city, burned the castle and took 3,000 prisoners.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=7}} The city was attacked one more time by the Teutonic Knights in 1402.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=8}} Since 1413, Grodno had been the administrative center of a [[powiat]] in [[Trakai Voivodeship]]. Polish King Władysław II Jagiełło often stopped in Grodno, including in 1414, 1416, 1418 and 1425.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=9}} In 1425, Polish-Teutonic talks concerning the borders took place there.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=9}}

To aid the reconstruction of trade and commerce, the grand dukes allowed the creation of a [[Jew]]ish commune in 1389. It was one of the first Jewish communities in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. In 1441 the city received its charter, based on the [[Magdeburg Law]]. In 1445, [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] received a delegation from [[Kraków]] in Grodno announcing his election as king of Poland.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=9}}

As an important centre of trade, commerce, and culture, Grodno was a notable [[royal city]] and was also one of the royal residences and political centers of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. In the 1580s, Grodno was the ''[[de facto]]'' capital of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, when King [[Stephen Báthory of Poland]] moved his main residence and military headquarters there.<ref name=sm>{{cite journal|last=Marozau|first=Siarhei|year=2020|title=Stefan Batory w pamięci historycznej Grodna i jego mieszkańców (XX – początek XXI wieku)|journal=Studia Białorutenistyczne|publisher=Wydawnictwo Uniwersytetu Marii Curie-Skłodowskiej|location=Lublin|volume=14|page=90|issn=1898-0457}}</ref> Stephen Báthory rebuilt the [[Old Grodno Castle]] into an important royal residence and built the [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] Batorówka Palace.<ref name=sm/> The Old and [[New Castle in Grodno|New Castles]] were often visited by the Commonwealth monarchs. Kings [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] and Stephen Báthory died there, and the latter was initially buried at the local [[Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Grodno|Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary]].{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=10}}<ref name=sm/> Grodno was one of the places where the [[Sejm of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Sejms of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] were held, incl. the [[Grodno Sejm|last Sejm in the history of the Commonwealth]] in 1793.

The city was the site of two battles, [[Battle of Grodno (1706)]] and [[Battle of Grodno (1708)]] during the [[Great Northern War]].

After the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] and a subsequent administrative reform of the remainder of the Commonwealth, Grodno became the capital of the short-lived [[Grodno Sejm|Grodno Voivodeship]] in 1793.

===Late modern period===
In 1795, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] annexed the city in the [[Third Partition of Poland]]. It was in the New Castle on 25 November that year that the last Polish king and Lithuanian grand duke [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] [[abdication|abdicated]]. In the [[Russian Empire]], the city continued to serve its role as a seat of [[Grodno Governorate]] since 1801. The industrial activities started in the late 18th century by [[Antoni Tyzenhaus]], continued to develop.

During the [[Napoleonic Wars]] and fights for Polish liberation, in 1812, Polish [[uhlans]] of Prince [[Józef Poniatowski]] entered Grodno, followed by the French led by [[Jérôme Bonaparte]].{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|pp=45–46}} The entry of the allied Polish and French troops was met with enthusiasm by the population, the ''Accession to the Confederation of the inhabitants of the Grodno district'' was announced, [[Napoleon]]'s [[name day]] was officially celebrated and an obelisk was erected in honour of the French.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=46}}

In 1833, following the unsuccessful [[November Uprising]], notable local Polish independence activist and insurgent Michał Wołłowicz was [[hanged]] by the Russians, and the local Dominican gymnasium was seized by the Tsarist authorities.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=47}}

Local Poles took part in Polish national mourning after the Russian massacre of Polish protesters in [[Warsaw]] in 1861.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=48}} The [[Dean (Christianity)|dean]] of Grodno, Józef Majewski, was deported to [[Tobolsk]] in [[Siberia]] for attempting to organise a procession to [[Różanystok]], a regional Catholic pilgrimage destination.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=48}} Count Aleksander Bisping was arrested and imprisoned here during the [[January Uprising]] (1863-1864) before his exile to [[Ufa]].<ref name=Anderson>Anderson, F.L.M., 1864, Seven Months' Residence in Russian Poland in 1863, London: Macmillan and Co.</ref>{{rp|210–211}} After the fall of the uprising, a ban on the use of Polish in public places was introduced in 1865, and [[martial law]] was in force in Grodno until 1871.{{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=50}}

As a result of Russian discriminatory policies (see ''[[Pale of Settlement]]'') the city experienced an influx of Jewish immigrants in the 19th century, and thus had a significant Jewish population before [[the Holocaust]]: according to [[Russian census of 1897]], out of the total population of 46,900, Jews constituted 22,700 (around 48%, or almost half of the total population).<ref>Joshua D.

After the outbreak of World War I, Grodno was [[belligerent occupation|occupied]] by [[German Empire|Germany]] (3 September 1915){{sfn|Jodkowski|1923|p=51}} and ceded by [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]] under the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Russia–Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in 1918. After the war the German government permitted a short-lived state to be set up there, the first one with a ''Belarusian'' name—the [[Belarusian People's Republic]]. This declared its independence from Russia in March 1918 in [[Minsk]] (known at that time as Mensk), but then the [[Rada of the Belarusian Democratic Republic]] had to leave Minsk and fled to Grodno and later to the [[Temporary capital of Lithuania|temporary]] Lithuanian capital [[Kaunas]].<ref name="SantykiaiVle">{{cite web |last1=Mockienė |first1=Jurgita |last2=Spečiūnas |first2=Vytautas |title=Baltarusijos santykiai su Lietuva |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/baltarusijos-santykiai-su-lietuva/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=22 June 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> All this time the military authority in the city remained in German hands until April 1919.<ref name="Gardinoapskritis">{{cite web |title=Gardino apskritis |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/gardino-apskritis/ |website=[[Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija]] |access-date=22 June 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> Nevertheless, military units of the [[Lithuanian Armed Forces]] were formed in the German-controlled part of the [[Grodno Region]] in 1918–1919.<ref name="Gardinoapskritis"/><ref name="Surgailis1374">{{cite book |last1=Surgailis |first1=Gintautas |title=Lietuvos kariuomenės gudų kariniai daliniai 1918–1923 m. |date=2020 |publisher=[[General Jonas Žemaitis Military Academy of Lithuania]] |location=Vilnius |isbn=978-609-8277-00-5 |pages=13–74 |url=https://etalpykla.lituanistika.lt/fedora/objects/LT-LDB-0001:B.03~2020~1602607958931/datastreams/DS.001.0.01.BOOK/content |access-date=22 June 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> For example, a Belarusian unit named [[1st Belarusian Regiment]], commanded by Alaksandar Ružancoŭ, was formed mainly from Grodno's inhabitants in 1919 as a part of the Lithuanian Armed Forces and participated in Lithuania's side during the [[Lithuanian Wars of Independence]], thus large amount of its members were awarded with the highest state award of Lithuania –  [[Order of the Cross of Vytis]].<ref name="Surgailis1374"/><ref name="Lukosevicius">{{cite web |last1=Lukoševičius |first1=Ernestas |title=Baltarusių karžygiai – Lietuvos laisvės ir nepriklausomybės kariai |url=https://alkas.lt/2016/03/25/e-lukosevicius-baltarusiu-karzygiai-lietuvos-laisves-ir-nepriklausomybes-kariai-nuotraukos/ |website=Alkas.lt |date=25 March 2016 |access-date=22 June 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> In accordance with an agreement between Lithuania and Belarus (Rada BNR), the Grodno Region was joined to Lithuania.<ref name="SantykiaiVle"/> According to Lithuanian president [[Antanas Smetona]], the Lithuanians considered granting an autonomy to the Belarusian territories within Lithuania (as requested by Belarusian side; there were Belarusian members in the [[Council of Lithuania]] and representation in the Government of Lithuania by [[Lithuanian Ministry for Belarusian Affairs]]).<ref name="Blaszczak11">{{cite journal |last1=Błaszczak |first1=Tomasz |title=Baltarusiai Lietuvos valstybės taryboje 1918–1920 metais |journal=Parliamentary Studies |date=2013 |issue=15 |publisher=[[Vytautas Magnus University]] Czesław Miłosz Centre |location=Kaunas |pages=98–118–98–118 |doi=10.51740/ps.vi15.236 |url=https://journals.lnb.lt/parliamentary-studies/article/view/236/199 |access-date=22 June 2024 |language=lt |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Smetona |first1=Antanas |author-link=Antanas Smetona |title=Vairas (Be rytojaus) |date=1924 |location=Kaunas |pages=1–3 |volume=6th |url=https://www.epaveldas.lt/object/recordDescription/LNB/LNB00AD1C8E |access-date=22 June 2024|language=lt}}</ref>

After the outbreak of the [[Polish–Bolshevik War]], the German commanders of the [[Ober Ost]] feared that the city might fall to Soviet Russia, so according to the 1919 Treaty of [[Białystok]] on 27 April 1919 they passed authority to Poland,<ref name="Gardinoapskritis"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Balstogės sutartis |url=https://www.vle.lt/straipsnis/balstoges-sutartis/ |website=Visuotinė lietuvių enciklopedija |access-date=22 June 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> which just regained independence several months earlier.

Initially, prosperity was reduced due to the fact that the city remained only the capital of a powiat, while the capital of the [[Białystok Voivodeship (1919–1939)|voivodeship]] was moved to [[Białystok]]. However, in the late 1920s the city became one of the biggest Polish Army garrisons. This brought the local economy back on track. According to the [[1921 Polish census]], the population of the city was 49.9% Polish, 43.4% Jewish, 4.3% Belarusian, 2.0% Russian, 0.26% German and 0.05% Lithuanian.<ref name=gus>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->|title=Skorowidz miejscowości Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej.

===World War II===
[[File:German Army near the Church of the Discovery of the Holy Cross in Hrodna during World War II in 1940.jpg|thumb|left|German Army in Grodno during World War II in 1940]]
During the [[Invasion of Poland|Polish Defensive War]] of September to October 1939 the garrison of Grodno was mostly used for the formation of numerous military units fighting against the invading [[Wehrmacht]]. In the course of the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] (initiated on 17 September 1939) heavy fighting took place in the city between Soviet and improvised Polish forces, composed mostly of [[march battalion]]s and volunteers.<ref name="Piesakowski0">''The Fate of Poles in the USSR 1939–1989'', by Tomasz Piesakowski {{ISBN |0-901342-24-6}} Page 36</ref> In the course of the [[Battle of Grodno (1939)|Battle of Grodno]] {{awrap|(20-22 September)}} the [[Red Army]] lost some hundred men (according to Polish sources; according to Soviet sources – 57 killed and 159 wounded) and also 19 tanks and 4 APCs destroyed or damaged. The Polish side suffered at least 100 killed in action, military and civil, but losses still remain uncertain in detail (Soviet sources claim 644 killed and 1543 captives with many guns and machine guns etc. captured). Over 300 captured Polish defenders of the city, including Polish Army officers and youth, were massacred afterwards by the Soviets.<ref>{{cite book|author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Agresja sowiecka na Polskę i okupacja wschodnich terenów Rzeczypospolitej 1939–1941|year=2019|language=pl|location=Białystok-Warszawa|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]]|page=9|isbn=978-83-8098-706-7}}</ref> After the Soviet forces surrounded the engaged Polish units, the escaping Polish units withdrew to Lithuania.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

In accordance with the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of August 1939, the city was [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupied]] by the Soviet Union and annexed into the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. Several thousand of the city's [[Polish people|Polish]] inhabitants were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] to remote areas of the Soviet Union.

On 23 June 1941, the city came under [[Nazi Germany|German]] occupation that lasted until 16 July 1944. It was administered as part of the [[Bialystok District]]. Surviving inmates of the Grodno prison were released and the scale of the [[NKVD prisoner massacres]] revealed.<ref name="ipn/pdf">

===Byelorussian SSR and Republic of Belarus===
Since 1945, the city has been a centre of one of the provinces of the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]], now of the independent Republic of Belarus. Most of the Polish inhabitants were expelled or fled to Poland in [[Polish population transfers (1944–1946)|1944–1946]] and [[Repatriation of Poles (1955–1959)|1955–1959]]. However, in 2019 Poles are still the second-most numerous nationality in the city (22%), after Belarusians.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The Grodno Old Town was severely damaged during World War II and post-war authorities lacked will to preserve its heritage. The [[Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Grodno|Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], which because of its founder (14th century) was commonly referred to as ''[[Vytautas]]' Church'', was first turned into a warehouse and eventually in 1961 was blown up by a decision of the Grodno Executive Committee.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Almonaitytė-Navickienė |first1=Vaida |title=Vytauto bažnyčia Gardine |url=https://autc.lt/architekturos-objektas/?id=659 |website=Autc.lt |access-date=23 June 2024 |language=lt}}</ref> The [[:be:Гарадзенская ратуша|Grodno Town Hall]] (constructed in 1513) was demolished to expand [[Savieckaja Square]]. The early 17th century Baroque style [[:be:Кляштар бернардзінак (Гродна)|Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary and Bernardine Monastery]] was demolished in 1951 also by a decision of the Grodno Executive Committee and the Grodno Regional Drama Theatre was built in its place.<ref>{{cite web |title=Як выглядаў кляштар на месцы драмтэатра ў Гродне |url=https://planetabelarus.by/publications/yak-vyglyada-klyashtar-na-mestsy-dramteatra-grodne-shmat-starykh-fota/ |website=PlanetaBelarus.by |access-date=23 June 2024 |language=be}}</ref>

In 2005, the reconstruction of the historical centre of Grodno began. In 2008, the Belarusian Voluntary Society for the Protection of Historical and Cultural Monuments declared violations of the Law on the Protection of Historical and Cultural Heritage: the destruction of the cultural layer in the historic Old Market Square, demolition of 28 [[Constructivist architecture]] buildings in Mickevich, Gorky and September 17 streets in order to replace them with a modern hotel complex and the main traffic flow is directed in dangerous proximity to the New and Old Castles, while the plans to rebuild the Grodno Town Hall and the Church of the Blessed Virgin Mary (''Vytautas' Church'') are not being implemented.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Астаповіч |first1=A. |title=Прэс-рэліз Беларускага добраахвотнага таварыства аховы помнікаў гісторыі і культуры |url=http://baj.by/m-p-printpub-tid-1-pid-4674.html |website=Беларуская асацыяцыя журналістаў |access-date=23 June 2024 }}{{Dead link|date=June 2024 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Jewish community===
Jews began to settle in Grodno in the 14th century after the approval given to them by the Lithuanian Grand Duke [[Vytautas]].{{Sfn|ЭЕЭ|2005}} During the next years, their status had changed several times and in 1495 the Jews were deported from the city and banned from settling in Grodno (the ban was lifted in 1503). In 1560 there were 60 Jewish families in Grodno. They were concentrated on the "Jewish street" with their own synagogue and "hospital". In the year 1578 the great synagogue of Grodno was built by rabbi [[Mordecai Yoffe|Mordehai Yaffe]] (Baal ha-Levush). The synagogue was severely damaged in a fire in 1599.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

[[File:Grodno Wielka Synagoga 02.jpg|thumb|[[Great Synagogue (Grodno)|Great Synagogue]]]]
The community was not affected by the [[Khmelnytsky uprising]] but suffered during the 1655 Cossack uprising and during the [[Great Northern War#1702–1710: Russia and the Baltic provinces|war with Sweden]] (1703–1708). After Grodno was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1795 it was made part of the [[Pale of Settlement]] within which Jewish residency was allowed, and beyond which it was prohibited. Thus the Jewish population continued to grow and in 1907 there were 25,000 Jews out of a total population of 47,000.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

In the period of independent Poland, a yeshiva had operated in the city ([[Grodno Yeshiva|Shaar ha-Tora]]) under the management of Rabbi [[Shimon Shkop]]. Before the German-Soviet [[invasion of Poland]] there were about 25,000 Jews in Grodno out of 50,000 total population.<ref>[http://www.jewishgen.org/Belarus/info_holocaust_in_grodno.htm The Holocaust in Grodno].</ref> During the German occupation of the city, on 1 November 1942 the Jews were concentrated in 2 ghettos. 15,000 men were confined to the old part of the city where the main synagogue was located. A high wall of 2 meters was built around the ghetto. The second ghetto was located in the Slovodka part of the city with 10,000 inhabitants. The head of the [[Judenrat]] was appointed Dr. Braur (or Brawer), the school's headmaster, who served in this duty until his execution in February 1943 during a roundup for a deportation to Treblinka.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Megargee |first1=Geoffrey |title=Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos |date=2012 |publisher=University of Indiana Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=978-0-253-35599-7 |page=Volume 2, page 892}}</ref> Several local Jews were [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|rescued by Poles]] who either hidden them in the city or transported them to other locations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Datner|first=Szymon|year=1968|title=Las sprawiedliwych|language=pl|location=Warszawa|publisher=Książka i Wiedza|pages=53–55}}</ref>

On 2 November 1942 the deportations to the death camps began and during 5 days in February 1943, 10,000 Jews were sent to [[Auschwitz]]. Later, on 13 February, 5,000 Jews were sent to [[Treblinka]]. During the deportations, many synagogues were looted and some people were murdered. The last Jews were deported in March 1943. By the end of the war, only one Jew had remained in the ghetto. However, a few hundred survived in the camps or in hiding in the area.  Perhaps as many as 2000 survived, including those who fled or were deported to the USSR.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Megargee |first1=Geoffrey |title=Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos |date=2012 |publisher=University of Indiana Press |location=Bloomington, Indiana |isbn=978-0-253-35599-7 |page=893}}</ref>

After the war, the Jewish community was revived. Most of the Jews emigrated after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Today there are several hundred Jews in the city with most of the community's activity centralized in the main synagogue that had been returned to the community by the authorities in the 1990s.{{Sfn|ЭЕЭ|2005}} The head of the community is Rabbi Yitzhak Kaufman.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}

==Religion, education and culture==
[[File:Plac Lenina w Grodnie.jpg|Lenin Square|thumb|left]]

The city has one of the largest concentrations of [[Roman Catholics]] in Belarus. It is also a centre of [[Culture of Poland|Polish culture]], with a significant number of [[Poles in Belarus|Poles living in Belarus]] residing in the city and its surroundings.

The [[Eastern Orthodox]] population is also widely present. The city's Catholic and Orthodox churches are important architectural treasures.

[[File:GrPark.jpg|thumb|Fountain in Central Park]]

The city houses the [[Grodno State Medical University]] where many students from different parts of Belarus acquire academic degrees, as do a number of foreign students. Other higher educational establishments are [[Yanka Kupala State University of Grodno]] (the largest education centre in Grodno Province) and Grodno State Agrarian University. To support the Polish community, a Polish school was built in 1995, where all subjects are taught in [[Polish language|Polish]] and students are able to pass exams to get accepted into [[Education in Poland|Polish universities]].

==Architecture==
The town was planned to be dominated by the [[Old Grodno Castle]], first built in stone by Grand Duke [[Vytautas]] and thoroughly rebuilt in the [[Renaissance]] style by Scotto from Parma at the behest of [[Stefan Batory]], who made the castle his principal residence. Batory died at this palace seven years later (December 1586) and originally was interred in Grodno. (His [[autopsy]] there was the first to take place in [[Eastern Europe]].) After his death, the castle was altered on numerous occasions, although a 17th-century stone arch bridge linking it with the city still survives. The Wettin monarchs of Poland were dissatisfied with the old residence and commissioned [[Matthäus Daniel Pöppelmann]] to design the [[New Grodno Castle]], whose once sumptuous Baroque interiors were destroyed during World War II.

===Medieval===
[[File:Horadnia (Hrodna), Kaloža. Горадня, Каложа (2021) 02.jpg|right|thumb|''[[Kalozha Church|Kalozha]]'', an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox church]] of [[Boris and Gleb|Sts. Boris and Gleb]], 12th century]]
The oldest extant structure in Grodno is the [[Kalozha Church]] of [[Boris and Gleb|Sts. Boris and Gleb]] (Belarusian: ''Каложская царква''). It is the only surviving monument of ancient [[Black Ruthenia]]n architecture, distinguished from other Orthodox churches by prolific use of polychrome faceted stones of blue, green or red tint which could be arranged to form crosses or other figures on the wall.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Roberts|first1=Nigel|title=Belarus|publisher=Bradt Travel Guides|location=Bucks, England|isbn=9781841629667|page=220|edition=3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2TG6BwAAQBAJ&q=only+surviving+monument+of+Black+Ruthenian+architecture&pg=PA220|access-date=31 May 2017|date=May 2015}}</ref>

The church was built before 1183 and survived intact until 1853, when the south wall collapsed, due to its perilous location on the high bank of the Neman. During restoration works, some fragments of 12th-century frescos were discovered in the apses. Remains of four other churches in the same style, decorated with pitchers and coloured stones instead of frescos, were discovered in Grodno and [[Vaŭkavysk]]. They all date back to the turn of the 13th century, as do remains of the first stone palace in the Old Castle.

===Baroque===

}}

The [[St. Francis Xavier Cathedral, Grodno|Cathedral of St. Francis Xavier]] stands on [[Batory Square]] (now: [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] Square). The cathedral was a [[Jesuit]] church until 1773. This specimen of high [[Baroque architecture]], exceeding 50 metres in height, was started in 1678. Due to wars that rocked Poland-Lithuania at that time, the cathedral was consecrated only 27 years later, in the presence of [[Peter the Great]] and [[Augustus the Strong]]. Its late Baroque frescoes were executed in 1752.

The extensive grounds of the Bernardine monastery (1602–18), renovated in 1680 and 1738, display all the styles flourishing in the 17th century, from Gothic to Baroque. The interior is considered a masterpiece of so-called [[Vilnius]] Baroque. Other monastic establishments include the old Franciscan cloister (1635), Basilian convent (1720–51, by Giuseppe Fontana III), the church of the [[Bridgettine]] cloister (1642, one of the earliest Baroque buildings in the region) with the wooden two-storey dormitory (1630s) still standing on the grounds, and the 18th-century buildings of the Dominican monastery (its cathedral was demolished in 1874).

Other sights in Grodno include the Orthodox cathedral, a polychrome [[Russian Revival]] extravaganza from 1904; the botanical garden, the first in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, founded in 1774; a curiously curved building on the central square (1780s); a [[Grodno TV Tower|254-metre-high TV tower]] (1984); and Stanisławów, a summer residence of the last Polish king.

==Transport==
[[File:Гродно, БКМ 321 №111.jpg|thumb|right|A [[trolleybus]] on route 1 in November 2016]]
