'''Mukalla''' ({{langx|ar|ٱلْمُكَلَّا|Al Mukallā}}), officially the '''Mukalla City District''' ({{langx|ar|مديرية مدينة المكلا|}}), is a seaport and the capital [[city district]] of [[Yemen]]'s largest governorate, [[Hadhramaut Governorate|Hadhramaut]].<ref name="Laughlin2008">{{cite book |last=McLaughlin |first=Daniel |title=Yemen |publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] |chapter=10: Southeast Yemen |pages=191–198 |isbn=978-1-8416-2212-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eQvhZaEVzjcC&q=mukalla |year=2008}}</ref> The city is in the [[South Arabia|southern part of the Arabian Peninsula]] on the [[Gulf of Aden]], on the shores of the [[Arabian Sea]], about {{convert|480|km|abbr=off}} east of [[Aden]]. It is the most important port city in the Hadhramaut region. It is also the sixth-largest city in Yemen, with a population of approximately 595,000 as of 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Al-Mukalla Population 2023 |url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/al--mukalla-population |access-date=2023-08-14 |website=worldpopulationreview.com}}</ref> The city is served by the nearby [[Riyan International Airport]].

== Etymology ==
The current name "Mukalla" (المكلا) is derived from the Arabic verb "kala" (كلا), meaning "to preserve" or "to nurture." This reflects the city's historical role as a safe harbor and bustling port, providing shelter and nurturing trade in the region.<ref>{{Cite web |title=المكلا.. لؤلؤة البحر العربي {{!}} خيُوط |url=https://www.khuyut.com/blog/almukala |access-date=2024-02-17 |website=www.khuyut.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=المكلا بين تاريخين {{!}} خيُوط |url=https://www.khuyut.com/blog/almukala-hadramout |access-date=2024-02-17 |website=www.khuyut.com}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=المكلا ...تعددت الاسماء والحب واحد.... |url=https://www.shabwaah-press.info/news/18593 |access-date=2024-02-17 |website=www.shabwaah-press.info |language=en}}</ref>

However, several other names and epithets have been associated with Mukalla throughout its history, each offering insights into its development and cultural significance:

* '''Al-Kheesa:''' This early name, meaning "bay" or "cove" in Arabic, highlights Mukalla's sheltered location and its early function as a fishing village.<ref name=":0" />
* '''Bandar Yaqoub:''' This name comes from the saint ''Yaqoub bin Yusuf'', a man who settled in the city around the 12th century AD. His shrine remains a significant local landmark.<ref name=":0" />
* '''Bandar Omar:''' Named after a local figure, ''Omar bin Ali bin Sheikh Abu Bakr'', who founded the Al-Rawd Mosque near Yaqoub's shrine.<ref name=":0" />
* '''Bandar Al-Naqeeb:''' Attributed to Captain ''Salah bin Hamad Al-Kassadi'', a prominent ruler from the Al-Kassad dynasty that governed Mukalla in the 18th century.<ref name=":0" />
* '''Bandar Ghalib:''' This name emerged during the reign of Sultan [[Ghalib II al-Qu'aiti|''Ghaleb bin Awad Al-Quaiti'']], who ruled the Hadhramaut region in the early 20th century.<ref name=":0" />

== History ==
{{Main|History of Yemen}}
Mukalla is not far from [[Bi'r Ali|Qana]], the ancient principal Hadrami [[trading post]] between [[India]] and [[Africa]], with [[incense]] producing areas in its [[hinterland]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Myos Hormos |work=Maritime Incense Route |url=http://nabataea.net/cane.html |access-date=7 Dec 2008}}</ref>
[[File:Mukalla. Aerial View, 1932.jpg|thumb|Aerial View of Mukalla, 1932]]
Mukalla was founded in 1035 as a fishing settlement. After witnessing a struggle for control by the [[Kathiri]] and [[Qu'aiti]] Sultanates in the 19th and 20th centuries, it became the capital of the Qu'aiti State of [[Hadhramaut]]. The Qu'aiti Sultanate was part of the [[Aden Protectorate|Eastern Aden Protectorate]] until that merger, and a British Resident Advisor was stationed at Mukalla. The other major cities of the Sultanates were [[Ash-Shihr]] and [[Shibam]].<ref name="Laughlin2008" />
[[File:Old Mukalla.jpg|thumb|Mukalla in the mid 1900s]]


Captain Haines, a British officer who surveyed Yemen in the 1830s, described Mukalla as a town of 4,500 inhabitants with a significant trade in slaves.<ref>{{cite book |author=Thomas Buxton |title=The African Slave Trade |url=https://archive.org/details/africanslavetra00buxtgoog |location=London |publisher=[[John Murray (publishing house)|Jorn Murray]] |year=1839}}</ref> British explorers [[Theodore Bent]] and [[Mabel Bent]] used Mukalla several times in the 1890s to enter and exit the [[Wadi Hadhramaut]]: <blockquote>“Our starting-point for the interior was Makalla, which is 230 miles from Aden, and is the only spot between Aden and Maskat which has any pretensions to the name of port. The name itself means 'harbour'… Here we were deposited in December 1893 by a chance steamer, one which had been chartered and on which for a consideration we were allowed to take passage. I took turns with the captain to sleep in his cabin, but there was nothing but the deck for the others.”<ref>{{Cite book |last=Bent |first=J. Theodore (James Theodore) |url=http://archive.org/details/southernarabia00bentuoft |title=Southern Arabia |last2=Bent |first2=Theodore |date=1900 |publisher=London : Smith |others=Robarts - University of Toronto}}</ref> </blockquote>In 1967, Mukalla lost its status of [[capital city]] of the [[Qu'aiti|Qu'aiti Sultanate]] as it became a part of the communist [[South Yemen|People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]] and following the [[Yemeni unification]] in 1990, it became part of what is modern-day [[Yemen]].[[File:Qu'aiti, Mukalla, Yemen.jpg|thumb|This is a photograph of Mukalla taken in the 1940s and showing that it still had its almost medieval qualities about it.]]

=== Yemeni Civil War ===
{{main|Yemeni Civil War (2014–present)|Battle of Mukalla (2016)|Saudi-led intervention in Yemen}}

During the [[Yemeni Civil War (2014–present)|Yemeni Civil War]], on 2 April 2015, [[Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula]] (AQAP) stormed the central prison, freeing hundreds of prisoners including two senior AQAP commanders. They attacked the central bank and seized 17 billion Yemeni riyals and 1 million U.S. dollars before taking control of the presidential palace in the city. It was reported the [[Battle of Mukalla (2015)|entire city was under their control]] and they planned to establish an Islamic [[emirate]] in the wider Hadramaut region.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/yemen/11510765/Al-Qaeda-frees-300-prisoners-in-Yemen-jail-break.html|title=Al-Qaeda frees 300 prisoners in Yemen jail break|date=2 April 2015|work=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=12 May 2016}}</ref> Mukalla became AQAP's headquarters, and the capital of their Emirate in Yemen after their takeover.

In April 2015 Yemeni Al-Qaida leader [[Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi]] was killed in a US drone strike in the city, the [[SITE Intelligence Group]] said, citing media reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/07/middleeast/aqap-commander-killed/|title=Senior AQAP leader Nasr Ibn Ali al-Ansi killed|author-last=Ford|author-first=Dana|date=7 May 2015|work=CNN|access-date=12 May 2016}}</ref>

On 23 March 2015, a US airstrike hit an AQAP training camp, killing at least 50 people. Some days later, AQAP held a major rally in the city, against the US and their airstrikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vocativ.com/303320/al-qaeda-in-yemen-sends-children-to-protest-u-s-drone-strikes/|title=Al-Qaeda In Yemen Sends Children To Protest U.S. Drone Strikes|work=Vocativ|access-date=12 May 2016|archive-date=30 August 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190830135355/https://www.vocativ.com/303320/al-qaeda-in-yemen-sends-children-to-protest-u-s-drone-strikes/|url-status=dead}}</ref> In April 2016, it was reported that AQAP bounds at last 1,000 of its fighters inside the Mukalla only, with their tax collection in the city ranging from 2 to higher than 5&nbsp;million U.S. dollars per day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://english.alarabiya.net/en/features/2016/04/08/Al-Qaeda-emerges-stronger-and-richer-from-Yemen-war.html|title=Al Qaeda emerges stronger and richer from Yemen war|date=April 8, 2016|website=Al Arabiya English}}</ref>

On 3 November 2015, [[Cyclone Chapala]] struck Mukalla and destroyed the city's waterfront.<ref>{{cite news |date=3 November 2015 |title=Cyclone Chapala batters war-torn Yemen |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34698709 |access-date=14 November 2015 |work=[[BBC]]}}</ref>

In mid April 2016, AQAP was consolidating its control in Mukalla and took over control of Mukalla's airport from forces affiliated with the pro-Ansar al Sharia Hadhrami Domestic Council, while also evacuating and planting explosives around nearby al Dhaba oil port. AQAP also arrested seven Yemeni fighters from a camp north of Mukalla in Wadi Hadramaut, where the UAE is reportedly training forces for operations against AQAP.{{cn|date=December 2023}} AQAP is also redistributing property from northern landowners to local tribal leaders in an effort to shore up support, according to reports. The UAE, a core member of the Saudi-led coalition, recently{{when?|date=December 2023}} led an operation to [[Lahij insurgency|recapture]] AQAP-held al Hawta in Lahij governorate, amid reports the country is seeking U.S. assistance for an expanded counter-terrorism campaign in Yemen.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://khabaragency.net/news58392.html|title=حصري- القاعدة يبدأ تجهيز ميدان المعركة: إخلاء مطار المكلا وتفخيخ ميناء "الضبة"|work=وكالة خبر للأنباء|access-date=12 May 2016}}</ref>

==== Recapture from Al Qaeda ====
Mukalla was [[Battle of Mukalla (2016)|recaptured]] from Al Qaeda on 25 April 2016 and lasted for one day after 2,000 [[Republic of Yemen Armed Forces|Yemeni]] and [[United Arab Emirates Armed Forces|Emirati troops]] advanced into the city, taking control of its port and airport and setting up checkpoints throughout the city.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/04/arab-coalition-enters-aqap-stronghold-in-port-city-of-mukalla-yemen.php|title=Arab coalition enters AQAP stronghold in port city of Mukalla, Yemen|work=The Long War Journal|access-date=12 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Yemen: Al-Qaeda fighters leave stronghold |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/4/25/yemen-war-al-qaeda-fighters-leave-mukalla |access-date=2023-08-26 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}</ref>

After the liberation of Mukalla, Major-General Faraj Al-Bahsani, the then-governor of the Hadhramaut governorate, said that they were now working on rebuilding health and education services, new homes and a local police force. 

During a press visit by ''[[The Independent]]'' in August 2018, the city appeared to be secured. Multiple checkpoints were present outside the city and weapons were not allowed to be brought into the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/mukalla-yemen-al-qaeda-civil-war-before-after-jihadi-terror-group-a8495636.html|title=Mukalla was once an al-Qaeda stronghold - this is what it's like today|date=August 17, 2018|website=The Independent}}</ref>
