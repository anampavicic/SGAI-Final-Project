The city of '''Warri''' is an oil hub within [[South South|South-South]] Nigeria and houses an annex of the [[Delta State]] [[Government House]]. Warri City is one of the major hubs of the [[petroleum industry in Nigeria]]. Warri, [[Udu, Nigeria|Udu]], [[Okpe]] and [[Uvwie]] are the commercial capital of [[Delta State]] with a population of over 311,970 people in 2006.<ref name="nigeria gov">{{Cite web |title=Archived copy |url=http://www.population.gov.ng/images/Vol%2003%20Table%20DSx%20LGAPop%20by%20SDistrict-PDF.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924075911/http://www.population.gov.ng/images/Vol%2003%20Table%20DSx%20LGAPop%20by%20SDistrict-PDF.pdf |archive-date=24 September 2015 |access-date=5 June 2013}}</ref> The city is the [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] [[territory]] of [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]], [[Urhobo people|Urhobo]] and [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]] people.

Warri shares boundaries with [[Uvwie]] to the east, [[Udu, Nigeria|Udu]] to the south east, [[Ogbe Ijaw|Ogbe-ijoh]] to the south, and other communities in [[Warri South|Warri South LGA]] to the west.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Uvwie · Nigeria|url=https://www.google.com/maps/place/Uvwie/@5.5644431,5.7788541,10z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x1041ada58d095a6f:0x26f40f634d9553d|access-date=2022-02-12|website=Uvwie · Nigeria|language=en}}</ref> Due to its rapid population growth and linked roads, the city and its border towns e.g. [[Uvwie]], [[Udu, Nigeria|Udu]] merged into a [[conurbation]] collectively referred as "Warri".

Warri sits on the bank of Warri River which joined Forcados River and [[Escravos River]] through [[Jones Creek, Texas|Jones Creek]] in the lower [[Niger Delta]] Region. The city has a modern seaport which serves as the cargo transit point between the [[Niger River]] and the Atlantic Ocean for import and export.

Warri served as the capital of the colonial Warri Province during the early 1900s when this part of [[Delta State]] was under the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Okoh|first=Oghenetoja|date=July 2016|title=WHO CONTROLS WARRI?

==History==

===Etymology===
The name 'WARRI' was first associated with the [[Itsekiri]] [[ancestral]] capital town of [[Ode-Itsekiri|Ode Itsekiri]] which the locals also refer to as 'Iwerre'. A [[mispronunciation]] of Iwerre by several European [[explorers]] probably resulted in various names like AWERRI, OUWERI, WARRE, WARREE, etc. The [[British Empire|British]] eventually anglancised it as WARRI.<ref>Ryder, A. F. C. "MISSIONARY ACTIVITY IN THE KINGDOM OF WARRI TO THE EARLY NINETEENTH CENTURY." Journal of the Historical Society of Nigeria, vol. 2, no. 1, 1960, pp. 1–26. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/41970817. Accessed 13 Jan. 2023.
</ref>

===British Advent pre Warri City===
[[British colonial]]ism effectively took off in the Western [[Niger Delta]] with the proclamation of the Oil Coast Protectorate by [[Great Britain]] in June 1885. [[British colonial]] administration was carried out through local chiefs like Nana Olomu of Ebrohimi in [[Benin River]]. This administration was effectively restricted to Benin River and its environs as the [[British Empire|British]] were content with conducting [[trade]] with the people of the [[hinterland]]s through the [[Itsekiri people|Itsekiri]] as [[Intermediary|middlemen]].<ref>Lloyd, P. C. "The Itsekiri in the Nineteenth Century; An Outline Social History." The Journal of African History, vol. 4, no. 2, 1963, pp. 207–31. JSTOR, http://www.jstor.org/stable/179535. Accessed 13 Jan. 2023.
</ref>

===Creation of Warri City===
The [[United Kingdom|British]] decided to move the seat of the administration of the Niger Coast Protectorate from the capital [[Ode-Itsekiri]] (Warri or Iwerre) to the [[upland and lowland|uplands]] to have effective control of the [[hinterlands]]. In order to achieve this, the British in 1906 took a [[lease]] of a new trading station opened in 1898 on [[virgin land]]s for Alexander Miller Brothers Limited of Liverpool at the mouth of the Okere Creeks. This new [[trading station]] was also named WARRI after the capital Ode-Itsekiri so the Itsekiris dubbed Ode-Itsekiri BIG WARRI in order to differentiate Ode-Itsekiri from the new trading station.<ref>Jones, G. I. Africa: Journal of the International African Institute, vol. 43, no. 1, 1973, pp. 78–80. JSTOR, https://doi.org/10.2307/1158548. Accessed 13 Jan. 2023.

==Demographics==
Its inhabitants are predominantly Christians of different denominations, and some practice a mixture of African traditional religions like most of Southern Nigeria. The city is known nationwide for its unique [[Pidgin English|Pidgin]], mostly among the less educated or uneducated.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ikeke |first=Nkem |date=2017-03-12 |title=8 cities in Nigeria where people cannot do without speaking Pidgin English |url=https://www.legit.ng/1092565-8-nigerian-cities-pidgin-english-spoken.html |access-date=2022-02-11 |website=Legit.ng - Nigeria news. |language=en}}</ref>

==Climate==
The area is characterised by a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Am'') with a mean annual temperature of {{cvt|26.7|°C}} and an annual rainfall amount of {{cvt|2770|mm}}. High temperatures are typically between {{convert|28|and|32|°C|°F|1}}. The climate is monsoonal and marked by two distinct seasons: the dry season and the rainy season. The dry season lasts from about November to April and is significantly marked by the cool "harmattan" dusty haze from the north-east [[trade winds]]. The rainy season spans May to October with a brief drier spell in August, but it frequently rains even in the dry season. The surrounding region is predominantly [[rainforest]], tending to [[swamp]]lands in some areas. The vegetation is rich in timber trees, palm trees, as well as fruit trees.
