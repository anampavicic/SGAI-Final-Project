'''Batam''', officially the '''City of Batam''' ({{langx|id|Kota Batam}}, not to be confused with ''Batam Kota'', a [[kecamatan|district]] within this city), is the largest [[List of regencies and cities of Indonesia|city]] in the [[Indonesian province]] of [[Riau Islands]]. The city administrative area covers three main islands of Batam, [[Rempang]], and [[Galang Island|Galang]] (collectively called [[Barelang]]), as well as [[Bulan Island|Bulang]] to the west and several smaller islands. Batam Island is the core [[Urban area|urban]] and [[Zoning|industrial zone]], while both Rempang Island and Galang Island maintain their rural character and low-density [[population]]; they are connected to Batam Island by short bridges. [[Bulan Island|Bulang Island]] and the islands to its north forming [[Belakang Padang District]] lie to the west of Batam Island but are also administratively within the city. Batam is an industrial [[boomtown]], an emerging transport hub, and part of a [[free trade zone]] in the [[Indonesia–Malaysia–Singapore Growth Triangle]], located {{cvt|20|km|mi}} off [[Singapore]]'s south coast.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/03/business/worldbusiness/IHT-in-todays-booming-asia-business-knows-no.html |title=In Today's Booming Asia, Business Knows No Boundaries |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |first=Michael |last=Richardson |date=3 August 1991 |access-date=22 October 2020 |archive-date=24 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201024142244/https://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/03/business/worldbusiness/IHT-in-todays-booming-asia-business-knows-no.html?searchResultPosition=6 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://imtgt.org/ |title=Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) |website=imtgt.org |access-date=22 October 2017 |archive-date=27 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210527072808/https://imtgt.org/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://imtgt.org/country-information// |title=Country Information – Indonesia-Malaysia-Thailand Growth Triangle (IMT-GT) |website=imtgt.org |access-date=22 October 2017 |archive-date=23 May 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210523114737/https://imtgt.org/country-information/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The first recorded inhabitants at Batam Island are [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]] known as [[Orang Laut]], from the year 231 AD.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://batam.tribunnews.com/2012/12/18/pulau-batam-dihuni-orang-selat-sejak-231-masehi |title=Pulau Batam Dihuni Orang Selat Sejak 231 Masehi |date=2012-12-18 |website=Tribun Batam |language=id-ID |access-date=2018-12-18 |archive-date=18 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181218193442/http://batam.tribunnews.com/2012/12/18/pulau-batam-dihuni-orang-selat-sejak-231-masehi |url-status=live }}</ref> The island group once served as the field of struggle of Admiral [[Hang Nadim]], against Portuguese invaders in the 16th century, and was utilised by the Indonesian government in the 1960s, who maintained a petroleum logistics base on [[Sambu Island]], one of the minor islands in the Batam group of islands.

In the 1970s, according to Presidential Decree No. 41/1973, [[Batam Island]] was designated as a working environment of an industrial area supported by ''Batam Island Industrial Development Authority'' or better known as ''Batam Authority Board'' (''BOB'', now ''Batam Development Board'' ({{langx|id|Badan Pengusahan Batam}} or ''BP Batam'') as the driving force for the development of Batam, with the initial aim of making Batam the "Indonesian version of Singapore". With the rapid development of the island, based on Government Regulation No. 34/1983, the Batam District (which is part of Riau Islands Regency) was upgraded to municipality status which has the duties to run government administration and society and support the development of ''BP Batam''.

In the [[Reformation in Indonesia|Indonesian Reformation era]] in the late 1990s, with Act No. 53/1999, the Batam administrative municipality changed its status to an autonomous region, namely Batam City [[Government]] to carry out governmental and developmental functions by involving ''BP Batam''.

== Geography ==
Batam is a roughly oval island with many bays, islets, and peninsulas, located west of [[Bintan Island]], south of Singapore, north of Rempang Island and Galang Island, and east of Bulang Island. The [[Singapore Strait]] separates [[Singapore]] and Batam, while the [[Riau Strait]] separates Batam and [[Bintan Island|Bintan]] island. Batam Municipality covers 3,869&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, of which 1,034.73&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> is land, a figure which includes some [[land reclamation]]. However, ''[[Barelang Bridge|Barelang]] Island'' (not actually one but three, see above) covers roughly 715&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of that 1,034.73&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, and Batam island itself covers only about 410&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> out of the total. The bulk of the municipal population resides on Batam Island.

===Climate===
Batam has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round.

[[File:Batam Centre - panoramio (2).jpg|thumb|right|Panoramic view of Batam Centre]]
Batam city is divided into twelve [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan'') – which include several adjacent islands such as [[Bulan Island|Bulang]] to the west, and [[Rempang]] and [[Galang Island|Galang]] to the south, as well as Batam Island itself. Batam Island is connected by bridges to [[Rempang]] and [[Galang Island|Galang]], and this group is thus often known by the abbreviation of ''[[Barelang Bridge|Barelang]]''. The districts are tabulated below with their areas, 2010 census populations<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and 2020 census populations,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021"/> together with the official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Batam Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.2171)</ref> The table also includes the number of administrative villages within each [[district]], all classed as urban ''kelurahan'',<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Batam Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.2171)</ref> and its postal codes.
