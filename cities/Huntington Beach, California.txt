'''Huntington Beach''' is a seaside city in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] in [[Southern California]], United States. The city is named after American businessman [[Henry E. Huntington]]. The population was 198,711 as of the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]], making it the fourth most populous city in Orange County, the most populous beach city in Orange County, and the seventh most populous city in the [[Los Angeles-Long Beach-Anaheim, CA Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. Located {{convert|35|mi}} southeast of [[Downtown Los Angeles]], it is bordered by [[Bolsa Chica Basin State Marine Conservation Area]] on the west, the [[Pacific Ocean]] on the southwest, by [[Seal Beach]] on the northwest, by [[Westminster, California|Westminster]] on the north, by [[Fountain Valley, California|Fountain Valley]] on the northeast, by [[Costa Mesa]] on the east, and by [[Newport Beach]] on the southeast.

Huntington Beach has a long {{convert|9.5|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch of sandy beach, mild climate, excellent [[surfing]], and beach culture. Swells generated predominantly from the North Pacific in winter and from a combination of Southern Hemisphere storms and cyclones in the summer focus on Huntington Beach, creating consistent surf all year long, hence the nickname "Surf City".<ref name=surfcity/>

The main thoroughfare of Huntington Beach, [[California State Route 39|Beach Boulevard]], was originally a cattle route for the main industry of the Rancho. Since its time as a parcel of the enormous Spanish land grant, Huntington Beach has undergone many incarnations. Once it was known as Shell Beach, the town of Smeltzer, and then Gospel Swamp for the revival meetings that were held in the marshland where the community college [[Golden West College]] stands. Later it became known as Fairview and then Pacific City, as it developed into a tourist destination. In order to secure access to the [[Pacific Electric]] Red Car lines<ref name="trains">{{cite news|url=https://latimes.com/local/orangecounty/la-me-oc-rail-20150512-story.html|title=A look at the trains that built the O.C. coast|author=Staff|date=May 12, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 12, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160215065500/http://www.latimes.com/local/orangecounty/la-me-oc-rail-20150512-story.html|archive-date=February 15, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> that used to criss-cross Los Angeles and ended in Long Beach, Pacific City ceded enormous power to railroad magnate [[Henry E.

The original [[Huntington Beach Pier]] was built in 1904 and was a 1,000-foot-long timber structure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stockteam.com/hbpier.html|title=Huntington Beach Pier Pictures, Information|website=www.stockteam.com|access-date=August 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801021419/http://www.stockteam.com/hbpier.html|archive-date=August 1, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.surfcityusa.com/about-huntington-beach/huntington-beach-history/|title=About Visit Huntington Beach DMO|website=www.surfcityusa.com|access-date=August 14, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011110104/https://www.surfcityusa.com/about-huntington-beach/huntington-beach-history/|archive-date=October 11, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Huntington Beach was incorporated on February 17, 1909, during the tenure of its first mayor, Ed Manning. Its first developer was Huntington Beach Company (formerly the West Coast Land and Water Company), a real-estate development firm owned by Henry Huntington. The Huntington Beach Company is still a major land-owner in the city, and owns most of the local mineral rights. The company is wholly owned by the [[Chevron Corporation]].<ref name=billiter>{{cite news|last1=Billiter|first1=Bill|title=The Huntington Beach Co.: City's Benefactor or Boss?|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1990-04-23-mn-177-story.html|access-date=September 25, 2015|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=April 23, 1990|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926021143/http://articles.latimes.com/1990-04-23/news/mn-177_1_huntington-beach|archive-date=September 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

Though many of the old reserves are depleted, and the price of land for housing has pushed many of the rigs off the landscape, oil pumps still dot the city.

Huntington Beach was primarily agricultural in its early years with crops such as lima beans, asparagus, peppers, celery and sugar beets. [[Imperial Sugar|Holly Sugar]] was a major employer with a large processing plant in the city that was later converted into an oil refinery.

The city's first high school, [[Huntington Beach High School]], located on Main Street, was built in 1906. The school's team, the Oilers, is named after the city's original natural resource.

In 2023, Huntington Beach became involved in a lawsuit against California governor Gavin Newsom. In March 2023, the state sued Huntington Beach for failing to comply with state housing regulations. The suit brought by the state argued that the city’s ban on the processing of Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) applications violated state housing laws. The city responded with a countersuit that argued it is not subject to state housing laws.<ref>{{Cite news |date=November 4, 2023 |title=State housing lawsuit against Huntington Beach put on pause |url=https://www.ocregister.com/2023/11/04/state-housing-lawsuit-against-huntington-beach-put-on-pause/ |access-date=November 28, 2023 |work=Orange County Register |language=en-US}}</ref> The state law required Huntington Beach to zone for 13,368 units to be built inside the city limits from October 2021 to 2029.<ref>{{Cite news |date=March 22, 2023 |title=Judge denies Huntington Beach's request to block enforcement of state housing laws |work =CBS Los Angeles |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/judge-denies-huntington-beachs-request-to-block-enforcement-of-state-housing-laws/ |access-date=December 3, 2023 |language=en-US}}</ref> Huntington Beach's lawsuit describes overturning the Regional Housing Needs Allocation (RHNA) which determines how housing needs are allocated.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|31.9|sqmi|km2|1}}. {{convert|26.7|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of it is land and {{convert|5.1|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}} of it (16.10%) is water.

The entire city of Huntington Beach lies in [[area codes 714 and 657]], except for small parts of [[Huntington Harbour, Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Harbour]] (along with Sunset Beach, the community adjacent to Huntington Harbour), which is in the [[562 area code]].

===Climate===
Huntington Beach has a borderline [[cold semi-arid climate|semi-arid]]/[[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: ''BSk/Csb''), gradually changing for the second to the west and south due to its low precipitation. Although areas such as Huntington Central Park and northern [[Bolsa Chica]] usually fall into the first climate type, thus being the boundary of the [[Mediterranean climate|cool summer Mediterranean climate]] on the west coast of [[North America]], except for elevated portions in the southern end of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-united-states.php|title=Interactive United States Koppen-Geiger Climate Classification Map|website=www.plantmaps.com|language=en|access-date=October 21, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011214712/https://www.plantmaps.com/koppen-climate-classification-map-united-states.php|archive-date=October 11, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> The climate is generally sunny, dry and cool, although evenings can be excessively damp. In the morning and evening, strong breezes often reach {{convert|15|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. Ocean water temperatures average {{convert|55|to|65|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.

Frost occurs only rarely, on the coldest winter nights. The area is annually affected by a [[marine layer]] caused by the cool air of the Pacific Ocean meeting the warm air over the land. This results in overcast and foggy conditions in May and June.

Between Downtown Huntington Beach and [[Huntington Harbour, Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Harbour]] lies a large marshy wetland, much of which is protected within the [[Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve]]. A $110 million restoration of the wetlands was completed in 2006.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fws.gov//bolsachica/ |title=The official web page of the Bolsa Chica Lowlands Restoration Project |publisher=U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619211326/http://www.fws.gov/bolsachica/ |archive-date=June 19, 2006 |url-status=live }}</ref> The reserve is popular with bird watchers and photographers.

South of Downtown, the Talbert, Brookhurst and Magnolia Marshes, which lie across the street from Huntington State Beach, had restoration completed in 2010.<ref>{{Cite news | last = Brennan | first = Pat | title = Wetlands, ocean unite | newspaper = [[Orange County Register]] | page = Local 1| date = February 27, 2010}}</ref>

The northern and southern beaches ([[Bolsa Chica State Beach]] and [[Huntington State Beach]], respectively) are state parks. Only the city maintains the central beach (Huntington City Beach). Camping and RVs are permitted here, and popular campsites for the [[Fourth of July]] and the Surfing Championships must be reserved many months in advance. Bolsa Chica State Beach is actually a sand bar fronting the Bolsa Bay and Bolsa Chica State Ecological Reserve.

===Surf City USA trademarks===
{{main|Surf City, USA}}
{{update section|date=December 2020}}

While Huntington Beach retains its 15-year trademark of Surf City Huntington Beach, the Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau filed four applications to register the "[[Surf City (song)|Surf City]] USA" [[trademark]] in November 2004. The idea was to market the city by creating an authentic brand based on Southern California's beach culture and active outdoor lifestyle while at the same time creating a family of product licensees who operate like a franchise family producing a revenue stream that could also be dedicated to promoting the brand and city. A ruling by the [[U.S. Patent and Trademark Office]] released on May 12, 2006, awarded three trademark registrations to the Bureau; nine additional trademark registrations have been granted since this time and ten other Surf City USA trademarks are now under consideration.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://www.primezone.com/newsroom/news.html?d=99014 |title=Huntington Beach Officially Registers Surf City USA Trademark |access-date=March 14, 2008 |date=May 12, 2006 |publisher=Huntington Beach Conference and Visitors Bureau |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821195134/http://www.primezone.com/newsroom/news.html?d=99014 |archive-date=August 21, 2014 }}</ref> One of the first products the Bureau developed to promote its brand was the Surf City USA Beach Cruiser by [[Felt Bicycles]] in 2006. The product has sold out every year in markets worldwide and created demand for a second rental bicycle model that will be marketed to resort locations across the globe starting in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feltracing.com/06/06_cruiser/surf_city.html |title=Felt Bicycles and Huntington Beach Join to Create Official Surf City USA Beach Cruiser |access-date=March 15, 2008 |date=November 5, 2005 |publisher=Felt Bicycles |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070407060358/http://www.feltracing.com/06/06_cruiser/surf_city.html |archive-date=April 7, 2007 }}</ref> The Bureau now has dozens of other licensed products on the market from Surf City USA soft drinks to clothing to glassware.

Huntington Beach is the site of the world [[surfing]] championships, held annually in the summer. The city is often referred to as "Surf City" because of this high-profile event, its history and culture of surfing. It is often called the "Surfing Capital of the World", not for the height of the waves, but rather for the consistent quality of surf.

===Surf and beaches===
[[George Freeth]] was the first person to surf in Huntington Beach with a demonstration on June 20, 1914. Freeth had been demonstrating surfing in Southern California since 1907 when he was hired first by [[Abbot Kinney]] in Venice, then [[Henry E. Huntington]] in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Moser |first=Patrick |title=Surf and Rescue: George Freeth and the Birth of California Beach Culture |date=2022 |publisher=University of Illinois Press |isbn=978-0-252-04444-1 |series=Sport and society |location=Urbana}}</ref> [[Duke Kahanamoku]] started surfing in Huntington Beach in 1925 and helped popularize the sport. The first surfboard shop, which was located underneath the [[Huntington Beach Pier]], opened in 1956 by [[Gordie Duane]].<ref name=100years>{{cite news|last1=Connelly|first1=Laylan|title=100 Years of Surf|work=Huntington Beach Wave|publisher=[[Orange County Register]]|pages=A1–A3| date=June 19, 2014}}</ref>

Huntington Beach has some of the best surf breaks in the State of [[California]] and that of the United States.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} Huntington Beach has four different facing beaches: Northwest, West, Southwest, and South. Northwest consists of [[Bolsa Chica State Beach]] with a length of {{convert|3.3|mi|km}}, the West consist of "The Cliffs" or "Dog Beach", Southwest is considered everything north of the pier which is operated by the City of Huntington Beach. South consists in everything south of the pier which primarily focuses on [[Huntington State Beach]] (2.2 Miles), which almost faces true South.

[[Bolsa Chica State Beach]] is operated by the [[California Department of Parks and Recreation]] and the Bolsa Chica State Beach Lifeguards. The beach is very narrow and the sand is very coarse. Bolsa Chica tends to have better surf with NW/W swells during the winter season. During the summer months the beach picks up south/southwest swells at a very steep angle. Due to the bottom of the beach, [[Breaking wave|surf]] at Bolsa Chica tends to be slowed down and refined to soft shoulders. Longboards are the best option for surfing in the Bolsa Chica area.

"The Cliffs" or "Dog Beach" is also another popular surf spot. This segment of Huntington Beach is so named because dogs are allowed around the cliff area. Beach is very restricted and often is submerged with high tides. Surf at this location tends to be even bigger than Bolsa Chica during the winter and often better. During the summer most of the South/Southwest swells slide right by and often break poorly. The best option is to take out a longboard, but shortboards will do at times. Dolphins have also been sighted in this area.<ref>{{cite news |last= Lyons |first= Matt |title= Dolphins descend on Huntington |newspaper= [[Orange County Register]] |date= July 27, 2008 |url= http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dolphins-descend-on-2106116-huntington |access-date= July 29, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080731125732/http://www.ocregister.com/articles/dolphins-descend-on-2106116-huntington |archive-date= July 31, 2008 |url-status= live }}</ref>

Just north and south of the Huntington Beach Pier are some well defined sandbars that shift throughout the year with the different swells. Southside of the Pier is often a popular destination during the summer for good surf, but the Northside can be just as well during the winter. Around the Pier it all depends on the swell and the sandbars. Shortboard is your best option for surfing around the Pier.

South Huntington Beach, also known as [[Huntington State Beach]], is where all the south swells impact the coastline. Huntington State Beach is operated by the State of California, Department of Parks & Recreation, and Huntington State Beach Lifeguards.<ref>{{cite web |author=Huntington State Beach Lifeguard Association, HSBLA |url=http://www.hsbla.com |title=Huntington State Beach Lifeguard Association |work=Hsbla.com |access-date=May 23, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522023122/http://www.hsbla.com/ |archive-date=May 22, 2009 |url-status=live }}</ref> This [[beach]] is very wide with plenty of [[sand]]. [[Sandbars]] dramatically shift during the spring, summer and fall seasons, thus creating excellent surf conditions with a combination South/West/Northwest swell. Due to the [[Santa Ana River]] jetties located at the southernmost end of the beach, large sandbars extend across and upcoast, forcing swells to break extremely fast and hollow. Best seasons for surfing at this beach is the summer and fall. The best option for surfing in this area is a shortboard.

Huntington Beach is also a popular destination for [[kite surfing]], and this sport can be viewed on the beach northwest of the pier.

===Bicycling===
The Huntington Beach bicycle path stretches for {{convert|10|mi|km}} alongside the beach.

The Orange County Register consistently names Huntington Dog Beach as the best dog park in Orange County.<ref>Marshak, Pam, [https://www.ocregister.com/2017/09/20/best-of-orange-county-2017-best-dog-park/ "Best of Orange County 2017: Best Dog Beach] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301225138/https://www.ocregister.com/2017/09/20/best-of-orange-county-2017-best-dog-park/ |date=March 1, 2018 }}, September 20, 2017</ref> Some popular events that take place at Dog Beach are Surf City Surf Dog<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.surfcityusa.com/events/signature-events/surf-city-surf-dog/|title=Surf City Surf Dog Competitions & Events - Sept 23|website=www.surfcityusa.com|access-date=March 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164804/https://www.surfcityusa.com/events/signature-events/surf-city-surf-dog/|archive-date=March 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> and So Cal Corgi Nation Beach Days.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://socalcorgibeachday.com/events/https/wwwfacebookcom/events/1075865255849483|title=2018 Spring Corgi Beach Day- Huntington Beach, CA|website=So Cal Corgi Nation|access-date=March 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301224831/http://socalcorgibeachday.com/events/https/wwwfacebookcom/events/1075865255849483|archive-date=March 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Dog Beach is free to the public.<ref name="home page">{{cite web|url=http://www.dogbeach.org/|title=Huntington Dog Beach|website=Huntington Dog Beach|access-date=March 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301224843/http://www.dogbeach.org/|archive-date=March 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The Preservation Society of Huntington Dog Beach works to keep the beach clean and safe. This [[501(c)3 organization|501(c)(3) non-profit organization]] was founded in 1997 and has five volunteers who serve on the board. The mission of the Preservation Society of Huntington Dog Beach is as follows: "to protect and preserve access to the beach for dogs and their people, as well as to promote responsible dog ownership in order to make our canine companions welcome members of society."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dogbeach.org/financial|title=Huntington Dog Beach - ABOUT US|website=Huntington Dog Beach|access-date=March 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301164619/http://www.dogbeach.org/financial|archive-date=March 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The society receives no public financing as it relies completely on private donations from dog-lovers who value this [[Public good (economics)|public good]], and it provides many valuable services that minimize the impact of the [[negative externalities]] caused by dog waste and unfriendly dogs. Doggie waste bags are provided for free (over 3,000 are used per day during the summer) and dog owners are encouraged to immediately dispose of their dog's waste in one of the many trash cans provided. Additionally, the society organizes a beach cleanup every Sunday.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dogbeach.org/beach-cleanup|title=Huntington Dog Beach - BEACH CLEANUP|website=Huntington Dog Beach|access-date=March 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301224951/http://www.dogbeach.org/beach-cleanup|archive-date=March 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> To keep visitors safe, aggressive dogs are not allowed and dogs must be kept under control at all times.

The society also creates [[Positive externality|positive externalities]] by providing the public with valuable information on their website, including rules to keep dogs safe, tips for introducing dogs to the beach for the first time, warnings about the danger of dogs drinking ocean water, and information about nearby RV parking and dog-friendly hotels.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dogbeach.org/faq|title=Huntington Dog Beach - FAQ|website=Huntington Dog Beach|access-date=March 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301225028/http://www.dogbeach.org/faq|archive-date=March 1, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Prospective visitors should be aware of the policy regarding leashes: "Under existing city ordinance, dogs must remain leashed. However, for the past several years only unleashed, potentially dangerous dogs have been cited or removed."<ref name="home page" /> One important exception is that leashes are always required when entering and exiting the park to ensure safety near PCH.

Fire protection in Huntington Beach is provided by the Huntington Beach Fire Department. Law enforcement is provided by the Huntington Beach Police Department. Huntington Beach Marine Safety Officers and its seasonal lifeguards are recognized as some of the best in the world with a top-notch safety record.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.huntingtonbeachca.gov/residents/beach_info/marine_safety.cfm?marine=marine|title=City of Huntington Beach, CA - Marine Safety|website=www.huntingtonbeachca.gov|access-date=February 1, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202012535/https://www.huntingtonbeachca.gov/residents/beach_info/marine_safety.cfm?marine=marine|archive-date=February 2, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It has an active [[Community Emergency Response Team]] training program, that trains citizens as Disaster Service Workers certified by [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) as a part of a free program run by the fire department's Office of Emergency Services.

Emergency services are also provided at State Beach locations. Peace Officers and lifeguards can be found at Bolsa Chica and Huntington State Beach. Such services consist of aquatic rescues, boat rescues, first aid and law enforcement. All services are provided by the State of California, Dept. Parks & Recreation.{{clarify|reason=Confusing; beginning of this sentence implies that the city is responsible for state beach law enforcement & lifeguard duties. This is not the case, except on a mutual-aid request basis.|date=April 2015}}
[[File:Huntington Beach Sundial.jpg|thumb|Warner Fire Station near [[Bolsa Chica State Beach]] and its prominent [[sundial]]]]
In 1926, the [[Santa Ana River]] dam failed, and flash-flooded its entire [[river delta|delta]]. The southern oceanic terminus of this delta is now a settled area of Huntington Beach. The distant dam is still functional, but silting up, which is expected to reduce its storage volume, and therefore its effectiveness at flood-prevention. The flood and dam-endangered areas are protected by a levee, but lenders require expensive flood insurance in the delta. There have been serious discussions to eliminate the need for flood insurance and this requirement has already been waived in some areas and may one day no longer be considered a credible threat.

Since it is a seaside city, Huntington Beach has had [[tsunami]] warnings, storm surge (its [[Huntington Beach Pier|pier]] has been rebuilt three times), sewage spills, tornadoes and waterspouts. The cold offshore current prevents hurricanes. The Pier that was rebuilt in the 1990s was engineered to withstand severe storms or earthquakes.

Large fractions of the settled delta are in [[soil liquefaction]] zones above known [[active fault]]s. Most of the local faults are named after city streets.

Many residents (and even city hall) live within sight and sound of active oil extraction and drilling operations. These occasionally spew oil, causing expensive clean-ups. Large parts of the developed land have been contaminated by heavy metals from the water separated from oil.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

The local oil has such extreme mercury contamination that metallic mercury is regularly drained from oil pipelines and equipment. Oil operations increase when the price of oil rises. Some oil fields have been approved for development. The [[brownfields|worst-polluted areas]] have been reclaimed as parks. At least one [[Superfund site]], too contaminated to be a park, is at the junction of Magnolia and Hamilton streets, near Edison High School.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.huntington-beach.ca.us/Business/redevelopment/southeast_coast_projects.cfm#ascon |title=Ascon Superfund Site |publisher=City of Huntington Beach |access-date=August 20, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100912200236/http://www.ci.huntington-beach.ca.us/Business/redevelopment/southeast_coast_projects.cfm#ascon |archive-date=September 12, 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On October 2, 2021, an [[2021 Orange County oil spill|oil spill]] occurred after a pipe burst, sending oil into the ocean and on the beach. The nearby Talbert Wetlands were affected, and the Pacific Airshow had to cancel the planned show for that day to prevent further damage.
