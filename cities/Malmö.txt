Malmö was one of the earliest-industrialised and most-[[Industrial Revolution|industrialised]] cities in [[Scandinavia]], and it struggled to adapt to [[post-industrial]]ism. It has undergone a major transformation since the 2000 completion of the [[Öresund Bridge]], producing new architectural developments, supporting new [[biotech]] and IT companies, and attracting students through [[Malmö University]] and other higher education facilities. Over time, Malmö's demographics have changed and by the turn of the 2020s almost half the municipal population had a foreign background.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.statistikdatabasen.scb.se/pxweb/sv/ssd/START__BE__BE0101__BE0101Q/UtlSvBakgGrov/table/tableViewLayout1/|title=Antal personer efter region, utländsk/svensk bakgrund och år|language=sv|access-date=7 December 2020}}</ref> The city contains many historic buildings and parks, and is also a commercial centre for the western part of [[Skåne County]]. It is also home to [[Malmö FF]], the Swedish [[association football|football]] club with the most national championships and the only Nordic club to have reached the [[UEFA Champions League|European Cup]] final.

Malmö has a [[#Climate|mild climate]] for the latitude and, normally, average high temperatures remain above freezing in winter, with prolonged snow cover being rare.

Malmö was Sweden's fastest growing city in 2020 and the population increased by 3,800 inhabitants during 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://malmo.se/Fakta-och-statistik/Befolkning.html|title=Befolkning - Malmö Stad|language=sv|access-date=19 December 2021|archive-date=19 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211219205353/https://malmo.se/Fakta-och-statistik/Befolkning.html|url-status=live}}</ref> With around 20-25% of its residents adhering to [[Islam]],<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Street |first=Nick Shindo |date=2016-03-11 |title=How young Muslim activists in Sweden are trying to protect youths from radicalization |url=https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-sweden-muslims-20160311-story.html |access-date=2024-05-08 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US |archive-date=31 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240331194952/https://www.latimes.com/world/europe/la-fg-sweden-muslims-20160311-story.html |url-status=live }}</ref> the city stands out as the most [[Islam in Sweden|Muslim-populated city in Sweden]] and Western Europe.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2010-09-30 |title=Sweden’s Quiet Revolution |url=https://www.nationalreview.com/2010/09/swedens-quiet-revolution-duncan-currie/ |access-date=2024-05-08 |website=National Review |language=en-US |archive-date=8 May 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240508125438/https://www.nationalreview.com/2010/09/swedens-quiet-revolution-duncan-currie/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news |last=Orange |first=Richard |date=2020-08-29 |title=Riots rock Malmö after far-right Swedish activists burn Qur'an |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/29/riots-rock-malmo-after-far-right-swedish-activists-burn-quran |access-date=2024-05-08 |work=The Observer |language=en-GB |issn=0029-7712 |archive-date=22 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922153741/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/29/riots-rock-malmo-after-far-right-swedish-activists-burn-quran/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Moreover, Malmö serves as a primary entry point for the majority of migrants heading to Sweden.<ref name=":0" /> Malmö is expected to have a population of 500,000 by 2050.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pmalmo.se/Om-parkering-Malmo/mediarum/aktuella-nyheter/ny-prispolicy-2022/|title=Ny prispolicy införs 2022|language=sv|access-date=14 February 2022|archive-date=14 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220214113332/https://www.pmalmo.se/Om-parkering-Malmo/mediarum/aktuella-nyheter/ny-prispolicy-2022/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Malmo Vapenbrev.png|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Malmö's 1437 [[grant of arms]]]]
Malmö was for centuries Denmark's second-biggest city.

Its original name was ''Malmhaug'' (with alternate spellings), meaning "Gravel pile" or "Ore Hill". An alternate and more gruesome story, stemming from the likeness of modern spelling "Malmö" to Swedish words "mal mö" (lit. "grind maiden"), suggests that a maiden was once ground up in a mill on what is now the town square. A millstone that was placed on the town square in 1538 has at times been connected to this pun.<ref>{{cite book |last=Årgången |first=Tjugofemte |url=http://www.elbogen.nu/Skrifter_pdf/MaFo1957.pdf |title=Malmö fornminnesfö rening |date=1957 |location=Sweden |page=40 |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=11 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191111122624/http://elbogen.nu/Skrifter_pdf/MaFo1957.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=MM 061911:002075 :: Malmö, Centrum, Stortorget, Kvarnstenen, Malmöstenen |url=http://carlotta.malmo.se/carlotta-mmus/web/object/1215845 |access-date=3 August 2020 |website=malmo.se |archive-date=24 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124004449/http://carlotta.malmo.se/carlotta-mmus/web/object/1215845 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Granskare |date=1903 |title=Rikt Folk |publisher=Fäderneslandet |url=https://tidningar.kb.se/2605199/1903-04-22/edition/157844/part/1/page/2/?q=malm%C3%B6stenen |access-date=3 August 2020 |archive-date=7 June 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210607132518/https://tidningar.kb.se/2605199/1903-04-22/edition/157844/part/1/page/2/?q=malm%C3%B6stenen |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 15th century, Malmö became one of Denmark's largest and most visited cities, reaching a population of approximately 5,000 inhabitants. It became the most important city around the [[Øresund]], with the German [[Hanseatic League]] frequenting it as a [[marketplace]], and was notable for its flourishing [[herring]] fishery. In 1437, King [[Eric of Pomerania]] (King of Denmark from 1396 to 1439) granted the city's arms: [[argent]] with a [[griffin]] [[gules]], based on Eric's arms from [[Pomerania]]. The griffin's head as a symbol of Malmö extended to the entire province of [[Skåne]] from 1660.

In 1434, a new [[citadel]] was constructed at the beach south of the town. This [[fortress]], known today as [[Malmö Castle|''Malmöhus'']], did not take its current form until the mid-16th century. Several other fortifications were constructed, making Malmö Sweden's most fortified city, but only Malmöhus remains.

[[File:1594 map of Elbogen.jpg|thumb|left|Malmö in 1594: [[Malmö Castle]] can be seen at far left, [[Sankt Petri Church, Malmö|Sankt Petri Church]]'s tower at centre]]

[[Lutheran]] teachings spread during the 16th century [[Protestant Reformation]], and Malmö became one of the first cities in Scandinavia to fully convert (1527–1529) to this Protestant denomination.

In the 17th century, Malmö and the [[Skåneland]] region came under control of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]] with Denmark, signed in 1658. Fighting continued, however; in June 1677, 14,000 Danish troops laid siege to Malmö for a month, but were unable to defeat the Swedish troops holding it.

By the dawn of the 18th century, Malmö had about 3,000 inhabitants. However, owing to the wars of [[Charles XII of Sweden]] (reigned 1697–1718) and to [[bubonic plague]] epidemics, the population dropped to 1,800 by 1727. The population did not grow much until the modern harbour was constructed in 1775. The city started to expand and the population in 1800 was 4,000. 15 years later, it had increased to 6,000.<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 February 2011 |title=Så har Malmö vuxit genom åren |url=http://malmo.se/Kommun--politik/Vart-Malmo/Vart-Malmo-artiklar/2011-02-20-Sa-har-Malmo-vuxit-genom-aren.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101064647/http://malmo.se/Kommun--politik/Vart-Malmo/Vart-Malmo-artiklar/2011-02-20-Sa-har-Malmo-vuxit-genom-aren.html |archive-date=1 January 2016 |access-date=6 December 2015 |publisher=[[Malmö Municipality]] |language=sv}}</ref>

[[File:Sodergatan-1913.jpg|thumb|left|{{lang|sv|Södergatan}} in 1913]]
In 1840, Frans Henrik Kockum founded the workshop from which the [[Kockums]] shipyard eventually developed as one of the largest shipyards in the world. The [[Southern Main Line]] was built between 1856 and 1864; this enabled Malmö to become a centre of manufacture, with major textile and mechanical industries. In 1870, Malmö overtook [[Norrköping]] to become Sweden's third-most populous city, and by 1900 Malmö had strengthened this position with 60,000 inhabitants. Malmö continued to grow through the first half of the 20th century. The population had swiftly increased to 100,000 by 1915 and to 200,000 by 1952.

===1900–1969===
[[File:Meeting of Scandinavian kings 2.jpeg|thumb|right|Malmö, 18 December 1914. All three Scandinavian Kings on the same balcony.]]
In 1914 (15 May to 4 October), Malmö hosted the [[Baltic Exhibition]]. The large park [[Pildammsparken]] was arranged and planted for this large event. The Russian part of the exhibition was never taken down, owing to the outbreak of [[World War I]].

On 18 and 19 December 1914, the ''Three Kings Meeting'' was held in Malmö. After a somewhat disturbed period (1905–1914), which included the dissolution of the [[Swedish-Norwegian Union]], King [[Oscar II]] was replaced with King [[Håkon VII]] in Norway, who was the younger brother of the Danish King [[Christian X]]. As Oscar died in 1907, and his son [[Gustav V]] became the new King of Sweden, the tensions within Scandinavia were still unresolved, but during this historical meeting, the Scandinavian Kings found internal understanding, as well as a common line about remaining neutral in the ongoing war.

Within sports, Malmö has mostly been associated with [[association football|football]]. [[IFK Malmö]] participated in the first ever edition of [[Allsvenskan]] 1924/25, but from the mid-1940s [[Malmö FF]] started to rise, and ever since it has been one of the most prominent clubs within Swedish football. They have won Allsvenskan 23 times in all (as of February 2018) between 1943/44 and 2017.

===1970–1999===
By 1971, Malmö's population reached 265,000 inhabitants, but this was the peak which would stand for more than 30 years.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Malmo Population 2022 (Demographics, Maps, Graphs)|url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/malmo-population|access-date=6 February 2022|website=worldpopulationreview.com|archive-date=6 February 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220206224740/https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/malmo-population|url-status=live}}</ref> ([[Svedala]] was, for a few years in the early 1970s, a part of Malmö municipality.)

By the mid-1970s Sweden experienced a [[recession]] that hit the industrial sector especially hard; shipyards and manufacturing industries suffered, which led to high unemployment in many cities of [[Skåne]]. Kockums shipyard had become a symbol of Malmö as its largest employer and, when shipbuilding ceased in 1986, confidence in the future of Malmö plummeted among politicians and the public. In addition, many middle-class families moved into one-family houses in surrounding municipalities such as [[Vellinge Municipality]], [[Lomma Municipality]] and [[Staffanstorp Municipality]], which profiled themselves as the suburbs of the upper-middle class. By 1985, Malmö had lost 37,000 inhabitants and the population was down to 225,500.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Malmo Population|url=https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/malmo-population|access-date=28 July 2024}}</ref>

The [[Sweden financial crisis 1990–1994|Swedish financial crises]] of the early 1990s exacerbated Malmö's decline as an industrial city; between 1990 and 1995 Malmö lost about 27,000 jobs and its economy was seriously strained. However, from 1994 under the leadership of the then mayor [[Ilmar Reepalu]], the city of Malmö started to create a new economy as a centre of culture and knowledge. Malmö reached bottom in 1995, but that same year marked the commencement of the massive [[Öresund Bridge]] road, railway and tunnel project, connecting it to Copenhagen and to the rail lines of Europe. The new [[Malmö University]] opened in 1998 on Kockums' former dockside.

===2000s and later===
Further redevelopment of the now disused south-western harbour followed; a city architecture exposition ([[Bo01]]) was held in the area in 2001, and its buildings and villas form the core of a new city district. Designed with attractive waterfront vistas, it was intended to attract, and has been successful in attracting, the urban middle-class.

Since 1974, the [[Kockums Crane]] had been a landmark in Malmö and a symbol of the city's manufacturing industry, but in 2002 it was disassembled and moved to South Korea. In 2005, Malmö gained a new landmark with completion of [[Turning Torso]], the tallest skyscraper in Scandinavia. Although the transformation from a city with its economic base in manufacturing has returned growth to Malmö, the new types of jobs have largely benefited the middle and upper classes.

In its 2015 and 2017 reports, [[Police in Sweden]] placed the [[Rosengård]] and the [[Södra Sofielund|Södra Sofielund/Seved]] district in the [[Vulnerable area#Especially vulnerable area|most severe category of urban areas with high crime rates]].<ref name="map_noa_utsatta_2015_p29">{{Cite book |url=https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%c3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf |title=Utsatta områden – sociala risker, kollektiv förmåga och oönskade händelser |publisher=Police in Sweden – Nationella Operativa Avdelningen – December 2015 |page=29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819054415/https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/%C3%96vriga%20rapporter/Utsatta-omraden-sociala-risker-kollektiv-formaga-o-oonskade-handelser.pdf |archive-date=19 August 2016}}</ref><ref name="map_noa_utsatta_2017_p41">{{Cite book |url=https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/Ovriga%20rapporter/Utsatta%20omr%c3%a5den%20-%20social%20ordning,%20kriminell%20struktur%20och%20utmaningar%20f%c3%b6r%20polisen.pdf |title=Utsatta områden – Social ordning, kriminell struktur och utmaningar för polisen / Dnr HD 44/14A203.023/2016 |date=June 2017 |publisher=[[Police in Sweden]] – Nationella operativa avdelningen – Underrättelseenheten |page=41 |access-date=22 October 2017 |archive-date=19 November 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171119114159/https://polisen.se/Global/www%20och%20Intrapolis/Ovriga%20rapporter/Utsatta%20omr%c3%a5den%20-%20social%20ordning,%20kriminell%20struktur%20och%20utmaningar%20f%c3%b6r%20polisen.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2023, however, the situation in [[Södra Sofielund|Södra Sofielund/Seved]] was deemed as improving, and it was re-categorised to a [[Vulnerable area#Risk area|risk area]], the less severe category.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lägesbild över utsatta områden: Regeringsuppdrag 2023 |date=November 2023 |publisher=Polismyndigheten |pages=38–40 |url=https://polisen.se/siteassets/dokument/ovriga_rapporter/utsatta-omraden/lagesbild-over-utsatta-omraden-2023.pdf |access-date=18 December 2023}}</ref>

Malmö is currently growing fast and detailed work is being planned near the [[Malmö Central Station]], in a district called Nyhamnen. Nyhamnen will provide 9,000 new housings, two larger buildings for offices and courts. It is expected to be complete around 2040–2050.<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 December 2019 |title=Översiktsplan för Nyhamnen |url=https://malmo.se/download/18.38c6709716cae2cad392c813/1577969982708/F%C3%96P_2037_Nyhamnen_antagen_20191219%20lowlow.pdf |access-date=20 December 2021 |publisher=[[Malmö Municipality]] |language=sv |archive-date=20 December 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211220202728/https://malmo.se/download/18.38c6709716cae2cad392c813/1577969982708/F%C3%96P_2037_Nyhamnen_antagen_20191219%20lowlow.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[Israel-Hamas war]] has left a deep scar on the society in Malmö since many of its citizens have roots and family ties to the [[Levant]]. Hours after the [[2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel|Hamas attack on Israel]], Malmö was in the spotlight when people took to the streets, waved Palestinian and other Middle Eastern flags in a caravan of cars. Some people celebrated and fired fireworks. As a result of the celebration, the long-standing collaboration between the Jewish community and the Islamic Academy was put on ice. When Malmö hosted [[Eurovision 2024]], there were enormous demonstrations and protests to stop [[Israel in the Eurovision Song Contest 2024|Israel's participation]]. Further more the conflict has caused conflicts in schools, especially in the classrooms. Large pro [[Israel–Hamas war protests|Palestinian protests]] takes place in Malmö every Weekend. The cityscape in Malmö has changed during the war, where Palestinian flags hang on building facades and the former "drug roundabout" on Möllevången has been renamed the "Gaza Roundabout".<ref> {{Cite news |date= 6 October 2024|title= Kriget i Gaza har satt djupa spår i Malmö: ”Ett av de svåraste åren i mitt liv”|work= Sveriges television|url= https://www.svt.se/nyheter/lokalt/skane/kriget-i-gaza-har-satt-djupa-spar-i-malmo-ett-av-de-svaraste-aren-i-mitt-liv}}</ref> [[Antisemitism]] remains a concern in Malmö and antisemitic incidents has risen since the start of the war. <ref>{{cite web |last1=Lidor |first1=Canaan |title=Protesters chant ‘bomb Israel’ and burn flag outside synagogue in Sweden |url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/protesters-chant-bomb-israel-and-burn-flag-outside-synagogue-in-sweden/ |website=The Times of Israel |access-date=11 June 2024}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Malmö by Sentinel-2, 2020-06-25.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of Malmö by ESA Sentinel-2]]
Malmö is located at [[13th meridian east|13°00' east]] and 55°35' north, near the southwestern tip of Sweden, in [[Skåne County]].

The city is part of the transnational [[Öresund Region]] and, since 2000, has been linked by the [[Öresund Bridge]] across the [[Öresund]] to [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. The bridge opened on 1 July 2000, and measures {{convert|8|km|0|abbr=off}} (the whole link totalling 16&nbsp;km), with pylons reaching {{convert|204.5|m|1|abbr=off}} vertically. Apart from the [[Helsingborg]]-[[Helsingør]] ferry links further north, most ferry connections have been discontinued.

===Climate===

[[File:Vattentornet vid Pildammarna.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pildammsparken]] with the old water tower]]
Malmö, like the rest of southern Sweden, has an [[oceanic climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Cfb]]). Despite its northern location, the climate is mild compared to other locations at similar latitudes, mainly because of the influence of the [[Gulf Stream]] and also its westerly position on the Eurasian landmass. Owing to its northern latitude, daylight lasts 17 hours 31 minutes in midsummer, but only around seven hours in midwinter. According to data from 2002 to 2014 [[Falsterbo]], to the south of the city, received an annual average of 1,895 hours of sunshine while Lund, to the north, received 1,803 hours. The sunshine data in the weather box is based on the data for Falsterbo.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nederbörd Solsken Och Strålning Året 2014 |trans-title=Precipitation and Sunshine 2014 (Historical Normals section) |url=http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/year/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_precipitation_sunshine_14.pdf?98231 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101064647/http://data.smhi.se/met/climate/time_series/year/vov_pdf/SMHI_vov_precipitation_sunshine_14.pdf?98231 |archive-date=1 January 2016 |access-date=15 April 2015 |publisher=[[Swedish Meteorological and Hydrological Institute]] (SMHI)}}</ref>

Summers are mild with average high temperatures of {{convert|20|to|23|C|F}} and lows of around {{convert|11|to|13|C|F}}. Heat waves during the summer arise occasionally. Winters are fairly cold and windy, with temperatures steady between {{convert|-3|and|4|C|F}}, but it rarely drops below {{convert|-10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}.

Rainfall is light to moderate throughout the year with 169 wet days. Snowfall occurs mainly in December through March, but snow covers do not remain for a long time,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Average Weather in Malmö, Sweden, Year-Round – Weather Spark |url=https://weatherspark.com/y/76106/Average-Weather-in-Malm%C3%B6-Sweden-Year-Round |access-date=18 March 2019 |website=weatherspark.com |archive-date=3 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200803185052/https://weatherspark.com/y/76106/Average-Weather-in-Malm%C3%B6-Sweden-Year-Round |url-status=live }}</ref> and some winters are free of snow.

==Transport==
[[File:Oresund bridge.jpg|thumb|The [[Öresund Bridge]], connecting Malmö to [[Copenhagen]] and the [[Scandinavian peninsula]] with [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Western Europe]] through Denmark.]]
[[File:Øresundståg.JPG|thumb|The [[Øresundståg|Öresund Line]]]]

Öresund Line trains cross the Öresund Bridge every 15 minutes (hourly during night) connecting Malmö to [[Copenhagen]], and [[Copenhagen Airport]]. The trip takes around 40 minutes. Additionally, some of the [[X 2000]] and [[Intercity train]]s to [[Stockholm]], [[Gothenburg]], and [[Kalmar]] cross the bridge, stopping at Copenhagen Airport. In March 2005, excavation began on a new railway connection called the [[City Tunnel (Malmö)|City Tunnel]], which opened for traffic on 4 December 2010. The tunnel runs south from [[Malmö Central Station]] through an underground station at the [[Triangeln railway station]] to [[Hyllievång]] (Hyllie Meadow). Then, the line comes to the surface to enter [[Hyllie railway station|Hyllie Station]], also created as part of the tunnel project. From Hyllie Station, the line connects to the existing Öresund line in either direction, with the Öresund Bridge lying due west.

Besides the Copenhagen airport, Malmö has an airport of its own, [[Malmö Airport]], today chiefly used for domestic Swedish destinations, [[charter flights]] and [[low-cost carriers]].

The [[motorway]] system has been incorporated with the Öresund Bridge; the [[European route E20]] goes over the bridge and then, together with the [[European route E6]] follows the Swedish west coast from Malmö–[[Helsingborg]] to Gothenburg. E6 goes further north along the west coast and through [[Norway]] to the Norwegian town [[Kirkenes]] at [[Barents Sea]]. The European route to [[Jönköping]]–Stockholm ([[European route E4|E4]]) starts at Helsingborg. Main roads in the directions of [[Växjö]]–Kalmar, [[Kristianstad]]–[[Karlskrona]], [[Ystad]] ([[European route E65|E65]]), and [[Trelleborg]] start as [[freeway]]s.

Malmö has {{convert|410|km|mi}} of bike paths; approximately 40% of all commuting is done by bicycle.

===Buses===
[[File:Malmoexpressen Malmo Central 20140618 0005 (14270129978).jpg|thumb|City bus at Malmö Central Station]]
{{Main|Buses in Malmö}}
Malmö has an extensive network of buses within the city, and is also the destination of many regional bus lines from the rest of Skåne. The bus network replaced the [[Trams in Malmö|tram network]] that existed from 1887 to 1973.

=== Ports ===
The city has two industrial harbours; one is still in active use and is the largest Nordic port for car imports.<ref>{{Cite web |year=2012 |title=Cars |url=http://www.cmport.com/ |access-date=1 December 2015 |publisher=[[Copenhagen Malmö Port]] |archive-date=29 July 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130729055128/http://www.cmport.com/ |url-status=live }}</ref> It also has two marinas: the publicly owned Limhamn Marina ({{Coord|55|35|N|12|55|E}}) and the private Lagunen ({{Coord|55|35|N|12|56|E}}), both offering a limited number of guest docks.

===Malmö S-Train===
A local train line with circular traffic at seven stations was opened in December 2018. The stations are [[Malmö Central Station]] (underground platforms) – [[Triangeln station]] – [[Hyllie station]] – [[Svågertorp railway station|Malmö South/Svågertorp]] – [[Persborg]] – [[Rosengård]] – [[Östervärn]] – [[Malmö Central Station]] (main overground terminus). Some trains arrive from [[Kristianstad]] and finish with a lap around Malmö, whilst other trains at this circular line, never drive outside the city limits. There is at least a 30 minutes service between each departure, but far more between the Central Station and Hyllie.

==Municipality==
{{Main|Malmö Municipality}}
[[File:Malmö rådhus, Stortorget, Malmö.jpg|thumb|Malmö's old city hall.]]
Malmö Municipality is an administrative unit defined by geographical borders, consisting of the ''City of Malmö''<ref>In all official contexts, the town Malmö calls itself "Malmö stad" (or City of Malmö), as does a small number of other Swedish municipalities, and especially the other two metropolitans of Sweden: [[Stockholm]] and [[Gothenburg]]. However, the term ''[[City of Sweden|city]]'' has administratively been discontinued in Sweden.</ref> and its immediate surroundings.

Malmö (''Malmö tätort'') consists of the urban part of the municipality together with the small town of [[Arlöv]] in [[Burlöv Municipality]]. Both municipalities also include smaller [[Urban areas in Sweden|urban areas]] and rural areas, such as the suburbs of [[Oxie]] and [[Åkarp]]. ''Malmö tätort'' is to be distinguished from ''Malmö stad'' (the city of Malmö), which is a semi-official name of [[Malmö Municipality]].

The leaders in Malmö created a commission for a socially sustainable Malmö in November 2010. The commissions were tasked with providing evidence-based strategies for reducing health inequalities and improve living conditions for all citizens of Malmö, especially for the most vulnerable and disadvantaged and issued its final report in December 2013.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://malmo.se/download/18.1d68919c1431f1e2a96c8e4/1389601836575/malmo%CC%88kommisionen_rapport_engelsk_web.pdf |title=Malmö's path towards a sustainable future |date=December 2013 |publisher=The Commission for a Socially Sustainable Malmö |access-date=1 December 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208153750/http://malmo.se/download/18.1d68919c1431f1e2a96c8e4/1389601836575/malmo%CC%88kommisionen_rapport_engelsk_web.pdf |archive-date=8 December 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{primary source inline|date=March 2014}}

==Economy==
[[File:SCB Malmo taxable income as percentage of national average 1995 2016.png|thumb|SCB Malmo taxable income per citizen as percentage of national average 1995 2016]]
The economy of Malmö was traditionally based on shipbuilding ([[Kockums]]) and construction-related industries, such as concrete factories. The region's leading university, along with its associated hi-tech and pharmaceutical industries, is located in [[Lund]] about {{convert|16|km|0|abbr=off}} to the north-east.

Malmö had a troubled economic situation following the mid-1970s. Between 1990 and 1995, 27,000 jobs were lost, and the budget deficit was more than one billion [[Swedish krona]] (SEK). In 1995, Malmö had Sweden's highest unemployment rate.<ref>{{Cite report|first1=Alexandru |last1=Panican |first2= Håkan |last2=Johansson |first3=Max |last3=Koch |first4=Anna |last4= Angelin |date=2013 |title=The local arena for combating poverty Malmö, Sweden |series=Combating Poverty in Europe (COPE): Re-organising Active Inclusion through Participatory and Integrated Modes of Multilevel Governance |url=https://www.lunduniversity.lu.se/lup/publication/c992b1e9-a000-48d2-8af4-e8ca4db1129a|publisher=Lund University |access-date=17 November 2020 |archive-date=24 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201224060414/http://cope-research.eu/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/COPE_WP6_Sweden_Malm%C3%B6.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref>

However, during the last two decades, there has been a revival.

==Culture==

===Film and television===
A striking depiction of Malmö (in the 1930s) was made by [[Bo Widerberg]] in his debut film {{lang|sv|[[Kvarteret Korpen]]}} ({{translation|'Raven's End'}}) (1963), largely shot in the shabby Korpen working-class district in Malmö. With humour and tenderness, it depicts the tensions between classes and generations.  The movie was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]] in 1965. In 2017, the film {{lang|sv|Medan Vi Lever}} ({{translation|'While We Live'}}) was awarded the prize for best film by an African living abroad at the [[Africa Movie Academy Awards]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Africa Movie Academy Awards 2017 Nominees & Winners |url=https://www.ama-awards.com/amaa-2017-award-winners.html |access-date=10 May 2018 |website=Africa Movie Academy Awards |archive-date=21 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170921230645/http://www.ama-awards.com/amaa-2017-award-winners.html |url-status=dead }}</ref> It was filmed in Malmö and [[Gambia]], and deals with identity, integration and everyday racism.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Larsson |first=Camilla |date=7 October 2016 |title=Malmöfilmen berör – men spretar |work=Sydsvenskan |url=https://www.sydsvenskan.se/2016-10-07/malmofilmen-beror--men-spretar |access-date=10 May 2018 |archive-date=10 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180510190045/https://www.sydsvenskan.se/2016-10-07/malmofilmen-beror--men-spretar |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Theatre===

In 1944, Malmö Stadsteater (Malmö Municipal Theatre) was established with a repertoire comprising stage theatre, opera, musical, ballet, musical recitals and experimental theatre. In 1993 it was split into three units, Dramatiska Teater (Dramatical Theatre), Malmö Musikteater (Music Theatre) and Skånes Dansteater (Skåne Dance Theatre) and the name was abandoned. The ownership of the last two were transferred to [[Region Skåne]] in 2006 Dramatiska Teatern regained its old name. In the 1950s [[Ingmar Bergman]] was the Director and Chief Stage Director of Malmö Stadsteater and many of his actors, like [[Max von Sydow]] and [[Ingrid Thulin]] became known through his films. Later stage directors include [[Staffan Valdemar Holm]] and [[Göran Stangertz]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Malmö Stadsteater |website=malmostadsteater.se |url=http://www.malmostadsteater.se/om_malmo_stadsteater/om_oss |access-date=2 February 2010 |language=sv |archive-date=19 September 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919213202/http://www.malmostadsteater.se/om_malmo_stadsteater/om_oss/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Malmö Musikteater were renamed [[Malmö Opera and Music Theatre|Malmö Operan]] and plays operas and musicals, classics as newly composed, on one of Scandinavia's large opera scenes with 1,511 seats.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Malmö Opera och Musikteater |url=http://www.malmoopera.se/d/1/inenglish|website=MalmoOpera.se|url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105024846/http://www.malmoopera.se/d/1/inenglish |archive-date=5 January 2010 |access-date=2 February 2010}}</ref> Skånes dansteater is active and plays contemporary dance repertory and present works by Swedish and international choreographers in their house in Malmö harbor.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About us |website=Skånes Dansteater |url=http://www.skanesdansteater.se/en-GB/Page/content/74/About-us.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818103625/http://www.skanesdansteater.se/en-GB/Page/content/74/About-us.aspx |archive-date=18 August 2010 |access-date=2 February 2010}}</ref>

Since the 1970s the city has also been home to independent theatre groups and show or musical companies. It also hosts a rock–dance–dub culture; in the 1960s [[The Rolling Stones]] played the [[Klubb Bongo]], and in recent years stars like [[Morrissey]], [[Nick Cave]], [[B.B.

The [[Rooseum]] Centre for Contemporary Art, founded in 1988 by the Swedish art collector and financier Fredrik Roos and housed in a former power station which had been built in 1900, was one of the foremost centres for [[contemporary art]] in Europe during the 1980s and 1990s. By 2006, most of the collection had been sold off and the museum was on a time-out; by 2010 Rooseum had been dismantled and a subsidiary of the National Museum of Modern Art inaugurated in its place.

Malmö's oldest building is [[St. Peter's Church, Malmö|St. Peter's Church]] ({{langx|sv|Sankt Petri}}). It was built in the early 14th century in Baltic Brick Gothic probably after [[St. Mary's Church, Lübeck|St Mary's Church]] in Lübeck. The church is built with a [[nave]], two aisles, a [[transept]] and a tower. Its exterior is characterized above all by the flying [[buttress]]es spanning its airy arches over the aisles and [[ambulatory]]. The tower, which fell down twice during the 15th century, got its current look in 1890.<ref>{{cite web |title=Svenska kyrkan&nbsp;— Malmö S:t Petri församling&nbsp;— S:t Petri kyrka&nbsp;— |website=Malmös katedral |url=http://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?di=88936&ptid=0 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170428230415/https://www.svenskakyrkan.se/default.aspx?di=88936&ptid=0 |archive-date=28 April 2017 |access-date=2 February 2010 |language=sv}}</ref> Another major church of significance is the [[Church of Our Saviour, Malmö]], which was founded in 1870.

Another old building is [[Tunneln]], {{convert|300|m|sigfig=1}} to the west of Sankt Petri Church, which also dates back to around 1300.

The oldest parts of Malmö were built between 1300 and 1600 during its first major period of expansion.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} The central city's layout, as well as some of its oldest buildings, are from this time. Many of the smaller buildings from this time are typical Scanian: two-story urban houses that show a strong Danish influence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

Recession followed in the ensuing centuries. The next expansion period was in the mid 19th century and led to the modern stone and brick city. This expansion lasted into the 20th century and can be seen by a number of [[Art Nouveau]] buildings, among those in the [[Malmö synagogue]]. Malmö was relatively late to be influenced by modern ideas of [[functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]] tenement architecture in the 1930s.

Around 1965, the government initiated the so-called [[Million Programme]], intending to offer affordable apartments in the outskirts of major Swedish cities. But this period also saw the reconstruction (and razing) of much of the historical city centre.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Stockholm: a universalist vision of housing tested by shortages|url=https://www.lafabriquedelacite.com/en/publications/stockholm-a-universalist-vision-of-housing-tested-by-shortages/|access-date=12 September 2021|website=La Fabrique de la Cité|language=en-US|archive-date=12 September 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210912152131/https://www.lafabriquedelacite.com/en/publications/stockholm-a-universalist-vision-of-housing-tested-by-shortages/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Since the late 1990s, Malmö has seen a more cosmopolitan architecture. {{lang|sv|[[Västra hamnen|Västra Hamnen]]}} (the Western Harbor), like most of the harbors to the north of the city centre, was industrial. In 2001 its reconstruction began as an urban residential neighbourhood, with 500 residential units, most were part of the exhibition [[Bo01]].<ref>{{Cite web |website=City of Malmö  |title=Western Harbour/Bo01 |url=http://www.malmo.se/English/Sustainable-City-Development/Bo01---Western-Harbour.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100106221448/http://www.malmo.se/English/Sustainable-City-Development/Bo01---Western-Harbour.html |archive-date=6 January 2010}}</ref> The exhibition had two main objectives: develop self-sufficient housing units in terms of energy and greatly diminish phosphorus emissions.
