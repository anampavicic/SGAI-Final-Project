==History==
Gujrat is a place of some antiquity and abounds in important ancient sites. The city and district formed part of the kingdom of [[Porus]] who ruled primarily within the [[Chaj Doab]]. He was defeated by [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] after a difficult campaign at the [[Battle of the Hydaspes|Battle of Hydaspes]] in May 326 BC.<ref name=":0" /> Alexander was impressed by his bravery and decided to reinstall him as a vassal of the [[Macedonian Empire]]. With Alexander's death in June 323 BC, [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (referred to in Greek sources as "Sandrokottos") who was of relatively humble origin possibly from the Punjab region, took control of the Punjab using it as a base for the founding of the [[Maurya Empire|Mauryan Empire]].<ref name=":0" /> It remained under the Mauryas until shortly after the death of [[Ashoka]] in 231 BC, and later came under the sway of [[Demetrius I of Bactria|Demetrius I]] who founded the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]].<ref name=":0" /> The Scythian invasion brought about by [[Maues]] in the latter half of the second century brought a change of rulers and the [[Indo-Scythians|Indo-Scythian Kingdom]] was established shortly after.<ref name=":0" /> This would change in the early first century CE when a Parthian governor [[Gondophares]] declared independence from the [[Parthian Empire]]. He moved east in 19 CE, conquering territory from the [[Indo-Scythians]] and [[Indo-Greeks]], thus forming his own [[Indo-Parthian Kingdom|Indo-Parthian kingdom]].<ref name=":0" /> The domains of the Indo-Parthians were greatly reduced following the invasions of the [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]] in the second half of the 1st. century CE who formed a vast prosperous empire in Central and South Asia which oversaw a flowering of [[Buddhism]].<ref name=":0" /> 

For several hundreds years, nothing is known about the area except between 455 and 550 CE when it was exposed to the ravages of the [[Alchon Huns]].<ref name=":0" /> After the decline of the Alchon Huns, it became the main base of the new kingdom of Gurjara, under a certain Alakhana.<ref name=":0" /> According to the [[Rajatarangini]], it was invaded between 883 and 902 CE by [[Sankaravarman]] of the [[Utpala dynasty|Utpala dunasty]] in Kashmir who fought and defeated the Gurjara ruler Alakhana.<ref name=":4">{{Citation |last=Zutshi |first=Chitralekha |title=The Multiple Lives of Rajatarangini |date=2014-07-07 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199450671.003.0005 |work=Kashmir's Contested Pasts |pages=184–239 |access-date=2023-06-07 |publisher=Oxford University Press|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199450671.003.0005 |isbn=978-0-19-945067-1 }}</ref> The name Alakhana etymologically is in reference to the Alchon Huns.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":5">{{Cite book |last=Ibbetson |first=Denzil |url=http://archive.org/details/panjabcastes00ibbe |title=Panjab castes |date=1916 |publisher=Lahore : Printed by the Superintendent, Government Printing, Punjab |others=University of California Libraries}}</ref> This may be the Ali Khan whom the present [[Gujjar]] tribe in Gujrat hail as their elder and founder of Gujrat.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":5" /> The putative Hunnic origin of the ruler Alakhana, remembered as Ali Khan in the tradition and memory of the Gujjars centuries after their conversion to Islam, led British historians to conclude that the Gujjars were originally from the stock of the [[Alchon Huns]].<ref name=":5" />

Mughal rule collapsed in Punjab after [[Moin-ul-Mulk|Mir Mannu]] died in 1753.

The city suffered further from the eight invasions of the Durrani Afghans between 1748 and 1767 who fought the Sikhs for control of Punjab.<ref name=":0" /> In the ensuing chaos, the city was captured by local [[Gakhars|Gakhar Punjabi]] tribesmen from the [[Pothohar Plateau]] to the west.<ref name=":1" />

Gujrat finally came under British control in 1849, following the collapse of the Sikh Empire in the wake of the Sikh defeat at the [[Battle of Gujrat]] on 22 February, which ended the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]].<ref name=":0" /> In 1867, Gujrat was constituted as a municipality.<ref name=":3" /> According to the census, the city had a population of 18,396 in 1881, 19,410 in 1901 and 21,974 in 1921.

==Geography==
