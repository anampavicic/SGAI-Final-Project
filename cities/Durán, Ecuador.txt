'''Durán''', also known as '''Eloy Alfaro''', is the second largest city in the province of [[Guayas (province)|Guayas]], [[Ecuador]] and the seat of [[Dur%C3%A1n Canton]]. It is located near the confluence of the Daule & Babahoyo rivers, where the [[Guayas River]] enters the ocean, across the Guayas River from [[Guayaquil]]. The name "Eloy Alfaro" was chosen because of the Ecuadorian ex-[[President (government title)|president]] [[Eloy Alfaro Delgado]]. According to the National [[census]] in 2022, the city had a population of 295,211.<ref name="pop"/> Many of its inhabitants commute to other places for work and it can be considered a "dormitory town". However, many people who live in Durán find work within the canton by opening "comedores" or small restaurants, selling produce at the market, or even opening little stores with basic produce and house necessities. The towns Durán, [[Samborondón]], and [[Guayaquil]] are connected by the bridge Rafael Mendoza Avilés.

Durán is also well known for being the first [[railroad]] hub in Ecuador. It is the coastal railhead for the Ecuadorean rail network, and the closest point to Guayaquil because the railroad does not bridge the Guayas River. Since July 2007, a government program for the railroad reactivation began as well as the railroad connecting Duran with other cities located in the highlands of Ecuador.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2009-12-23 |title=De Quito a Durán, en tren desde el 2012, promete EFE |url=https://www.eluniverso.com/2009/12/23/1/1447/quito-duran-tren-desde-promete-efe.html |access-date=2022-04-15 |website=El Universo |language=es}}</ref> The [[Empresa de Ferrocarriles Ecuatorianos]] offers rail service aimed at tourists to [[Quito]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Quito - Guayaquil Train Route {{!}} Andes through Coast on the Tren Crucero |url=http://www.ecuadorrail.net/ecuador-train-tours/tren-crucero.html |access-date=2022-04-15 |website=www.ecuadorrail.net}}</ref>

According to ''[[the Economist]]'', Duran had the highest murder rate in the world in 2023, with 148 homicides per 100,000 residents. The newspaper has labelled it "the most dangerous city in the world".<ref>{{Cite news |date=2024-05-08 |title=How to pacify the world’s most violent region |url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2024/05/08/how-to-pacify-the-worlds-most-violent-region |access-date=2024-05-09 |work=The Economist |issn=0013-0613}}</ref>
