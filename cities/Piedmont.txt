Piedmont also borders [[Switzerland]] to the north and [[France]] to the west. 

Piedmont has an area of {{convert|25402|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}, making it the second-largest region of Italy after [[Sicily]]. As of 31 January 2021, the population was 4,269,714. The capital of Piedmont is [[Turin]], which was also the capital of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] from 1861 to 1865.

==Toponymy==
The French ''Piedmont'', the Italian ''Piemonte'', and other variant cognates come from the [[medieval Latin]] {{Lang|la-x-medieval|Pedemontium}} or {{Lang|la-x-medieval|Pedemontis}}, i.e. {{Lang|la-x-medieval|ad pedem montium}}, meaning "at the foot of the mountains" (referring to the [[Alps]]), attested in documents from the end of the 12th century.<ref>{{cite book|author=Touring club italiano|title=Piemonte (non compresa Torino)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KjttelynsZEC&pg=PA11|year=1976|publisher=Touring Editore|isbn=978-88-365-0001-7|page=11}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{main|Geography of Piedmont}}
[[File:LagoMaggiore.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A view over Piedmont's [[Lake Maggiore]], [[Mount Rosa]], and [[Verbania]]]]
[[File:Vignale Monferrato-224-Alpenpanorama-1998-gje.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A [[Montferrat]] landscape, with the distant [[Alps]] in the background]]

Piedmont is surrounded on three sides by the [[Alps]], including [[Monte Viso|Monviso]], where the [[Po River|river Po]] rises, and [[Monte Rosa]]. It borders France ([[Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes]] and [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]]), Switzerland ([[Ticino]] and [[Valais]]), and the Italian regions of [[Lombardy]], [[Liguria]], [[Aosta Valley]], and for a very small part with [[Emilia Romagna]]. The geography of Piedmont is 43.3% mountainous, along with extensive areas of hills (30.3%) and plains (26.4%).

Piedmont is the second largest of Italy's 20 regions, after [[Sicily]]. It is broadly coincident with the upper part of the [[drainage basin]] of the river [[Po River|Po]], which rises from the slopes of Monviso in the west of the region and is Italy's largest river. The Po drains the semicircle formed by the [[Alps]] and [[Apennines]], which surround the region on three sides.

The countryside is very diverse: from the rugged peaks of the massifs of Monte Rosa and Gran Paradiso to the damp rice paddies of Vercelli and Novara, from the gentle hillsides of the [[Langhe]], [[Roero]], and [[Montferrat]] to the plains. 7.6% of the entire territory is considered [[protected area]]. There are 56 different national or regional parks; one of the most famous is the [[Gran Paradiso National Park]], between Piedmont and the [[Aosta Valley]].

Piedmont has a typically [[temperate climate]], which on the [[Alps]] becomes progressively temperate-cold and colder as it climbs to altitude. In areas located at low altitudes, winters are relatively cold but not very rainy and often sunny, with the possibility of snowfall, sometimes abundant. Snowfall, on the other hand, is less frequent and occasional in the northeast areas. Summers are hot with local possibilities of strong thunderstorms.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rosa|first=Diego|url=http://www.nimbus.it/liguria/rlm16/didattica/neve/stampa_neve.pdf|title=DIDATTICA - La neve|access-date=3 September 2009|publisher=Società Meteorologica Italiana - Sezione Ligura|website=Rivista Ligure di Meteorologia|page=3|date=April 2005}}</ref>

== History ==
{{see also|Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)}}
[[File:SardiniePiemont.jpg|thumb|The [[Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)|Kingdom of Sardinia]] in 1856]]

Piedmont was inhabited in early historic times by [[Celts|Celtic]]-[[Ligures|Ligurian]] tribes such as the [[Taurini]] and the [[Salassi]]. They were later subdued by the [[ancient Rome|Romans]] ({{Circa|220 BC}}), who founded several colonies there including ''[[Augusta Taurinorum]]'' (Turin) and ''[[Eporedia]]'' ([[Ivrea]]). After the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the region was successively invaded by the [[Burgundians]], the [[Ostrogoths]] (5th century), [[Byzantine Empire|East Romans]], [[Lombards]] (6th century), and [[Franks]] (773).

In the 9th–10th centuries there were further incursions by the [[Magyars]], [[Saracens]] and Muslim [[Moors]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Daftary |first=Farhad |title=The Ismāʻı̄lı̄s: Their History and Doctrines |year=1990 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |url=https://archive.org/details/ismlstheirhistor0000daft|url-access=registration |isbn=0-521-37019-1 }}</ref> At the time Piedmont, as part of the [[Kingdom of Italy (medieval)|Kingdom of Italy]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]], was subdivided into several marches and counties. In 1046, [[Otto, Count of Savoy|Otto of Savoy]] added Piedmont to the [[County of Savoy]], with a capital at [[Chambéry]] (now in France). Other areas remained independent, such as the powerful ''[[comune|comuni]]'' (municipalities) of [[Asti]] and [[Alessandria]] and the marquisates of [[Marquisate of Saluzzo|Saluzzo]] and [[Marquisate of Montferrat|Montferrat]]. The County of Savoy became the [[Duchy of Savoy]] in 1416, and Duke [[Emmanuel Philibert, Duke of Savoy|Emanuele Filiberto]] moved the seat to Turin in 1563. In 1720, the Duke of Savoy became King of [[Sardinia]], founding what evolved into the [[Kingdom of Sardinia (1720–1861)|Kingdom of Sardinia]] and increasing Turin's importance as a European capital.

The [[Republic of Alba]] was created in 1796 as a [[French client republic]] in Piedmont. A new client republic, the [[Piedmontese Republic]], existed between 1798 and 1799 before it was reoccupied by Austrian and Russian troops. In June 1800 a third client republic, the [[Subalpine Republic]], was established in Piedmont. It fell under full French control in 1801 and it was annexed by France in September 1802. In the [[Congress of Vienna]], the Kingdom of Sardinia was restored and furthermore received the [[Republic of Genoa]] to strengthen it as a barrier against France.

Piedmont was a springboard for [[Italian unification]] in 1859–1861, following earlier unsuccessful wars against the [[Austrian Empire]] in 1820–1821,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=mnn|title = History of Italy}}</ref> and 1848–1849.

Retrieved 7 January 2007.</ref> The [[House of Savoy]] became [[Kings of Italy]], and Turin briefly became the capital of Italy. However, when the Italian capital was moved to [[Florence, Italy|Florence]], and then to [[Rome]], the administrative and institutional importance of Piedmont was reduced. The only recognition of Piedmont's historical role was that the [[crown prince]] of Italy was known as the [[Prince of Piedmont]]. After Italian unification, Piedmont was one of the most important regions in the first Italian industrialization.<ref>Marco Meriggi, (1996).

== Economy ==
The [[gross domestic product]] (GDP) of the region was 137.4 billion euros in 2018, accounting for 7.8% of Italy's GDP. [[GDP per capita]] at [[purchasing power parity]] was 31,300 euros or 104% of the EU27 average in the same year. The GDP per employee was 111% of the EU average.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/documents/2995521/10474907/1-05032020-AP-EN.pdf/81807e19-e4c8-2e53-c98a-933f5bf30f58|title=Regional GDP per capita ranged from 30% to 263% of the EU average in 2018|website=Eurostat}}</ref> Since 2006, the [[Piemonte Agency for Investments, Export and Tourism]] began to facilitate outside investment and promote Piedmont's industry and tourism. It was the first Italian institution to combine the activities being carried out by pre-existing local organizations to promote the territory internationally.

The region contains major industrial centres, the most important of which is Turin, home to the [[Fiat]] conglomerate, but mass-market Fiat cars are not produced anymore, only small-scale manufacturing of luxury [[Maserati]] cars (36,702 in 2020). <ref name="carprod">{{cite web|url=https://www.startmag.it/smartcity/stellantis-cosa-succedera-agli-stabilimenti-fca-di-torino-pomigliano-e-melfi/|title=Stellantis production report|date=11 January 2021|language=it}}</ref> Most of the ex-Fiat plants now belong to other companies: aerospace is owned by [[Leonardo S.p.A.]], turbo jet engines by [[General Electric]], high-speed trains by [[Alstom]], bearings by [[SKF]]. Fiat does not exist anymore as an independent company; car production belongs to [[Stellantis]], and trucks, buses, tractors, agriculture and construction machines are produced by the independent company [[CNH Industrial]] (most manufacturing activity takes place in the [[United States]], in Piedmont only the production of [[New Holland Construction|New Holland]] excavators in [[San Mauro Torinese]] and [[IVECO#Engines|IVECO]] diesel engines in [[Turin]]). Neither of them are headquartered in [[Turin]] anymore, however, some research and development centres are still working. 

Formerly famous automotive design companies also were sold to global automotive groups: [[Italdesign Giugiaro]] to [[Volkswagen]], [[Ghia]] to [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Pininfarina]] to [[Mahindra & Mahindra|Mahindra]]; [[Gruppo Bertone|Bertone]] went into bankruptcy in 2014. Massive decline in automotive industry caused that other regions like [[Veneto]] (€163 billion in 2018) and [[Emilia-Romagna]] (€161 billion in 2018) surpassed Piedmont (€137 billion in 2018) in GDP and relative high unemployment. The peak of [[Automotive industry in Italy#Production figures|Italian motor vehicle production]] is reached in 1989 with 2.22 million units, but in 2019 (before the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Italy]]) it was only 0.92 million units. Even existing Italian car production now relocated to [[South Italy]], such as in [[Alfa Romeo Pomigliano d'Arco plant|Pomigliano d'Arco]] (140,478 in 2020), [[Melfi]] (229,848 in 2020), and [[Atessa]] (257,026 in 2020), because of cost cutting. <ref name="carprod"/>

There are some automotive suppliers of: 
* exhaust systems, electronic systems, suspension systems and automotive lighting in [[Venaria Reale]] and [[Rivalta di Torino]] from [[Magneti Marelli]]
* [[dual-clutch transmission]], gearboxes, drivelines and their mechatronics components from [[Graziano Trasmissioni|Dana Graziano]] 
* bearings from [[SKF]]
* tires ([[Michelin]] and [[Pirelli]])

=== Electronics and industrial equipment ===
There are some important companies in high-tech manufacturing: [[Comau]] (industrial robots) and Prima Industrie (laser equipment). Silicon wafer production is in [[Novara]] by MEMC. [[Olivetti]], once a major [[electronics industry]] whose plants were in [[Scarmagno]] and [[Ivrea]], has now turned into a small-scale computer service company and no longer produces computers. [[Leonardo S.p.A.|Leonardo]] Elettronica in Turin-Caselle develops and manufactures airborne mission systems and airborne computers. Machine building has a long tradition in Piedmont with the manufacturing of excavators, telescopic handlers, industrial refrigerators, printing machines, paper machines, packaging machines, glass machines, turbines, and high-speed trains.

=== Information technology ===
Piedmont has several notable [[IT]] firms such as [[Olivetti]] and [[Arduino]].

===Wool textile===
Italy is the world's largest exporter of carded (71.8% in 2018)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore?country=undefined&product=1243&year=2018&productClass=HS&tradeFlow=Net&target=Product&partner=undefined&startYear=undefined|title=Who exported Woven fabrics of carded wool in 2018?}}</ref> and combed (73.4% in 2018)<ref> {{cite web|url=https://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/explore?country=undefined&product=1244&year=2018&productClass=HS&tradeFlow=Net&target=Product&partner=undefined&startYear=undefined|title=Who exported Woven fabrics of combed wool in 2018?}}</ref> wool fabrics. These are the only two types of fabrics not dominated by Chinese textile exports. There are three industrial districts that process wool in Italy. One of them, [[Biella]], is located in Piedmont. 

Below are showed some basic stages of wool processing (not complete).

===Food===
{{Main|Piedmontese cuisine}}
Since 2006, the Piedmont region has benefited from the start of the [[Slow Food]] movement and [[Terra Madre]], events that highlighted the rich agricultural and [[viticulture|viticultural]] value of the Po Valley and northern Italy. A chain of food halls [[Eataly]] works in collaboration with [[Slow Food]]. Piedmont is the leading producer of confectionery, coffee, rice, and white truffles in Italy. It is ranked 3 of 20 for the production of quality DOC and DOCG wines with 1,982,718 hl, there are 17 DOCG wines of all possible types (white, red, sweet, sparkling). In 2019, Piedmont accounted for 16.5% of wine exports from Italy, ranking second behind [[Veneto]], with 36%.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Export of wine by region in Italy 2019 |url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/560284/export-of-wine-by-region-in-italy/ |access-date=2022-03-04 |website=Statista |language=en}}</ref> The typical food industries in Piedmont are:

===Agriculture===
[[File:The rice fields near Vercelli.jpg|thumb|Rice fields between [[Novara]] and [[Vercelli]].]]

Lowland Piedmont is a fertile agricultural region. The main agricultural products in Piedmont are [[cereals]], including [[rice]], representing more than 10% of national production, [[maize]], [[grape]]s for [[wine]]-making, [[fruit]] and [[milk]].<ref name="europa1">{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc1_eco.htm |title=Eurostat |work=Europa (web portal) |access-date=23 April 2010 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090210184406/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc1_eco.htm |archive-date=10 February 2009}}</ref> With more than 800,000 head of cattle in 2000, livestock production accounts for half of total agricultural production in Piedmont.

[[Piemonte (wine)|Piedmont]] is one of the great winegrowing regions in Italy. More than half of its {{convert|700|km2|acre|abbr=on}} of vineyards are registered with [[Denominazione di Origine Controllata|DOC]] designations. It produces prestigious wines as [[Barolo]] and [[Barbaresco]] from the [[Langhe]] near [[Alba (CN)|Alba]], and the [[Moscato d'Asti]] and sparkling [[Asti (wine)|Asti]] from the vineyards around [[Asti]]. The city of Asti is about {{convert|55|km|mi|abbr=on}} east of Turin in the plain of the Tanaro River and is one of the most important centres of [[Montferrat]], one of the best known Italian wine districts in the world, declared officially on 22 June 2014 a UNESCO World Heritage site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1390|title=Vineyard Landscape of Piedmont: Langhe-Roero and Monferrato|first=UNESCO World Heritage|last=Centre}}</ref> Indigenous grape varieties include [[Nebbiolo]], [[Barbera]], [[Dolcetto]], [[Freisa]], [[Grignolino]] and [[Brachetto]].

===Tourism===
Tourism in Piedmont employs 75,534 people and involves 17,367 companies operating in the hospitality and catering sector, with 1,473 hotels and other tourist accommodation. The sector generates a turnover of €2,671 million, 3.3% of the €80,196 million total estimated spending on tourism in Italy. The region is popular with both foreign visitors and those from other parts of Italy. In 2002 there were 2,651,068 total arrivals, 1,124,696 (42%) of whom were foreign. The traditional leading areas for tourism in Piedmont are the Lake District ("Piedmont's riviera"), which accounts for 32.84% of total overnight stays, and the metropolitan area of Turin, which accounts for 26.51%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.regione.piemonte.it/lingue/english/pagine/cultura/approfondimenti/02_piemontur_en.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Tourism in Piedmont: The Figures|website=Regione Piemonte|date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326094510/http://www.regione.piemonte.it/lingue/english/pagine/cultura/approfondimenti/02_piemontur_en.pdf|archive-date=26 March 2009|access-date=30 June 2023}}</ref>

In 2006, Turin hosted the [[XX Olympic Winter Games]], and in 2007 it hosted the [[2007 Winter Universiade|XXIII Universiade]]. Alpine tourism tends to concentrate in a few highly developed stations like [[Alagna Valsesia]] and [[Sestriere]]. Around 1980, the long-distance trail [[Grande Traversata delle Alpi]] (GTA) was created to draw more attention to the variety of remote, sparsely inhabited valleys. Within the tourism industry in Piedmont, a reference to the system of Royal Residences has to be made. First of all, it is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites since 1997 and, secondly, it represents a peculiarity of the region, since such a network cannot be found elsewhere in Italy. The Residences of the Royal House of Savoy belong to the historical and cultural heritage of Piedmont and nowadays they play a central role in the tourism field.<ref>{{Cite book|last=AA.VV.|title=Dimore Reali e la Corona di Delizie - Palazzi, castelli e ville sabaude in Piemonte I|publisher=La Stampa|year=2004|location=Torino|pages=1–13}}</ref> In a reality in which the tourism industry is characterized by an amalgam of several players and stakeholders, the creation of a system or network like the one of the Royal Residences represents an added benefit for the whole territory as well as a competitive edge.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cortese|first=Damiano|title=L'azienda turistica: nuovi scenari e modelli evolutivi|publisher=Giappichelli Editore|year=2018|location=Torino|pages=63–77}}</ref> Therefore, considering that tourism is a key factor in the creation of long-lasting value and working in a cooperative and collaborative perspective is essential,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Cortese D., Giacosa E., Cantino V.|title=Knowledge sharing for coopetition in tourist destinations: the difficult path to the network|publisher=Springer|year=2018|pages=1–12}}</ref> the network of the Royal Residences represents an example worth of notice.

Piedmont has many small and picturesque villages, 20 of them have been selected by {{lang|it|[[I Borghi più belli d'Italia]]}} ({{langx|en|The most beautiful Villages of Italy}}),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://borghipiubelliditalia.it/basilicata/|title=Basilicata|date=10 January 2017 |access-date=1 August 2023|language=it}}</ref> a non-profit private association of small Italian towns of strong historical and artistic interest,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.repubblica.it/viaggi/2023/01/16/news/borghi_piu_belli_italia_14_nuovi_2023-383794441/|title=Borghi più belli d'Italia.

==Transport==

=== Land ===
There are links with neighbouring France via the [[Fréjus Road Tunnel|Fréjus]] and [[Colle di Tenda]] tunnels as well as the [[Col de Montgenèvre|Montgenèvre Pass]]. Piedmont also connects with [[Switzerland]] by the [[Simplon Pass|Simplon]] and [[Great St Bernard]] passes. It is possible to reach Switzerland via a normal road that crosses eastern Piedmont, starting from [[Arona, Piedmont|Arona]] and ending in [[Locarno]], on the [[Italy–Switzerland border|Swiss border]]. The region has the longest motorway network amongst the Italian regions (about 800&nbsp;km). It radiates from Turin, connecting it with the other provinces in the region, as well as with the other regions in Italy. In 2001, the number of passenger cars per 1,000 inhabitants was 623 (above the national average of 575).<ref name="europa1"/> There is a [[Turin–Milan high-speed railway]], travel time is only 52 minutes.

=== Air ===
[[Turin International Airport|Turin-Caselle International Airport]] has domestic and international flights and handle 3,952,158 passengers and 3,334 tons of cargo in 2019 (before the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]).<ref name="europa1"/>

The population density in Piedmont is lower than the national average. In 2008, it was equal to 174 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, compared to the national figure of about 200. The [[Metropolitan City of Turin]] has 335 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>, whereas [[Verbano-Cusio-Ossola]] is the least densely populated province, with 72 inhabitants per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Eurostat">{{cite web |url=http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc1_pop.htm |title=Eurostat |work=Europa (web portal) |access-date=23 April 2010 |url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721132952/http://circa.europa.eu/irc/dsis/regportraits/info/data/en/itc1_pop.htm |archive-date=21 July 2011}}</ref>

The population of Piedmont followed a downward trend throughout the 1980s, a result of the natural negative balance (of some 3 to 4% per year), while the migratory balance since 1986 has again become positive because of immigration.<ref name="Eurostat"/> The population remained stable in the 1990s.

The Turin metro area grew rapidly in the 1950s and 1960s due to an increase of immigrants from southern Italy and Veneto and today it has a population of approximately two million. {{As of|2008}}, the Italian national institute of statistics (ISTAT) estimated that 310,543 foreign-born immigrants lived in Piedmont, equal to 7.0% of the total regional population. Most immigrants come from Eastern Europe (mostly from Romania, Albania, and Ukraine) with smaller communities of African immigrants.

== Government and politics ==
{{main|Politics of Piedmont}}
The Regional Government (''Giunta Regionale'') is presided by the president of the region (''presidente della regione''), who is elected for a five-year term and is composed of the president and 14 ministers, including a vice president (''vice presidente'').<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.regione.piemonte.it/governo/assessorati/index.htm |title=Sito Ufficiale della Regione Piemonte: Giunta regionale |publisher=Regione.piemonte.it |access-date=23 April 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218124455/http://www.regione.piemonte.it/governo/assessorati/index.htm |archive-date=18 February 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In the [[2010 Piedmontese regional election]], which took place on 29–30 March, [[Roberto Cota]] of [[Lega Nord]] defeated incumbent [[Mercedes Bresso]] of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]] (PD). For the [[2014 Piedmontese regional election]], Cota chose not to stand again for president and the parties composing his coalition failed to agree on a single candidate, resulting in a landslide victory for [[Sergio Chiamparino]], a member of the PD who had been [[mayor of Turin]] from 2001 to 2011. Chiamparino was in charge until the [[2019 Piedmontese regional election]], when [[Alberto Cirio]] of [[Forza Italia (2013)|Forza Italia]] became the new president of the region.

=== Administrative divisions ===
Piedmont is divided into eight provinces.

==Culture==
{{See also|List of museums in Piedmont}}

===Languages===
As in the rest of Italy, [[Italian language|Italian]] is the official national language. The main local languages are [[Piedmontese language|Piedmontese]], [[Western Lombard dialect|Insubric]] (spoken in the eastern part of the region), [[Occitan language|Occitan]] (spoken by a minority in the [[Occitan Valleys]] situated in the [[Province of Cuneo]] and the [[Metropolitan City of Turin]]), and [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]] (spoken by another minority in the alpine heights of the Metropolitan City of Turin), like in the [[Susa Valley]] and [[Walser language|Walser]] (spoken by a minority in the [[Province of Vercelli]] and [[Province of Verbano-Cusio-Ossola]]).

==Sport==
[[File:Juventus v Real Madrid, Champions League, Stadium, Turin, 2013.jpg|thumb|The [[Juventus Stadium]] in Turin is the home of [[Juventus FC]], throughout the years the most successful [[Serie A]] club.]]
In [[association football]], notable clubs in Piedmont include [[Turin]]-based [[Juventus]] and [[Torino F.C.|Torino]], who have won 43 official top-flight league championships (as of the [[2020–21 Serie A|2020–21 season]]) between them (36 titles won by Juventus and seven by Torino), more than any other city in Italy. Juventus is the most successful club in Italy, having won the most league titles (36), [[Coppa Italia]] titles (14), and [[Supercoppa Italiana]] titles (9) of any team in the country; [[Juventus Women]], established in 2017, also achieved success, immediately becoming one of the country's most successful women's teams. Other smaller teams include the old "Piedmont Quadrilateral" components [[Novara Calcio|Novara]], [[U.S. Alessandria Calcio 1912|Alessandria]], [[Associazione Sportiva Casale Calcio|Casale]], and [[Pro Vercelli]]. With the pre-[[World War II]] success of Pro Vercelli in 1910s and Juventus in 1930s, as well as winning cycles of Torino during the ''[[Grande Torino]]'' years and Juventus in different eras since 1950, the region became the most successful in terms of championships won. Casale and [[U.S.D. Novese|Novese]] contributed with one ''[[scudetto]]'' each. Other local teams include volleyball teams [[Piemonte Volley|Cuneo]] (male) and [[AGIL Volley|AGIL Novara]] (female), basketball teams Biella Basketball and Junior Casale, ice hockey team Hockey Club Turin, and roller hockey side [[Amatori Vercelli]], who have won three league titles, an Italian Cup, and two [[CERS Cup]]s. Turin hosted the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canoe.ca/SlamOlympicScandalArchive/jun19_tur.html|url-status=usurped|title=Turin wins 2006 Winter Olympics|website=Canoe.ca|date=19 June 1999|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050210105000/http://www.canoe.com/SlamOlympicScandalArchive/jun19_tur.html|archive-date=10 February 2005|access-date=30 June 2023}}</ref>
