'''Carrollton''' is a city in [[Dallas County, Texas|Dallas]], [[Denton County, Texas|Denton]], and [[Collin County, Texas|Collin]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]].<ref name=gnis/> As of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], its population was 133,434, making it the [[List of municipalities in Texas|27th-most populous]] city in [[Texas]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=2020 U.S. Census Population Totals |url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?g=1600000US4813024&tid=DECENNIALPL2020.P2 |access-date=2022-05-22 |website=data.census.gov}}</ref>

==History==

[[File:Carrollton, Texas ( ca. 1910-1930).jpg|thumb|left|Carrollton (c. 1910–1930)]]

The area was first settled by Jared Ford in 1842 by William and Mary Larner on a site within the Peters Colony grant. In 1844, the A. W. Perry family claimed land in the area around [[Trinity Mills, Texas|Trinity Mills]] where, in partnership with Wade H. Witt, a mill was established.<ref name="handbook">{{Handbook of Texas|id=hdc01|name=Carrollton, Texas}}. By Joan Jenkins Perez. Retrieved 4 February 2007.</ref>

The English colony, a group of families in the northeastern area of settlement which crossed into Denton County, was home to large landowners including the Furneaux, Jackson, Morgan, and Rowe families. Carrollton was most likely named after [[Carrollton, Illinois]], the original home of many of these settlers.<ref name="handbook"/>

Early on, Carrollton's livelihood was exclusively agricultural, but following the construction of the Dallas-Wichita Railroad through Trinity Mills in 1878, the community began to grow in its industrial significance. Carrollton's significance was further strengthened when the railroad was extended to [[Denton, Texas|Denton]] in 1880 by [[Jay Gould]], who sold the line to the [[Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad]] (the Katy) in 1881. By 1885, Carrollton had flour mills, cotton gins, two churches, a school, and a population of 150. The [[St. Louis Southwestern Railway]] (the "Cotton Belt") crossed the Katy in 1888, and the town became a shipping center for livestock, cotton, cotton seed, and grain, helping the town surpass Trinity Mills to the north.<ref name="handbook"/>

In 1913, Carrollton was officially [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]], and W.F. Vinson was elected mayor. A gravel industry that began in Carrollton in 1912 transformed the city, by the late 1940s, to a "grain and gravel" town. The city also supported a brick plant and a dairy industry, and National Metal Products established itself in the city in 1946.<ref name="handbook"/>

After [[World War II]], the city grew rapidly. In 1950, its population stood at 1,610, and it grew to 4,242 in 1960 and 13,855 in 1970. At this point, significant [[suburb]]an growth began spilling out of [[north Dallas]], and the city grew tremendously between 1970 and 1980, with a documented growth of 193% to 40,595 inhabitants. By 1983, the population was 52,000, by 1990, it had reached 82,169, and by 2010 the population had grown to 119,097.<ref name="Census 2010">{{cite web |title=Profile of General Population and Housing Characteristics: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (DP-1): Carrollton city, Texas |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/carrolltoncitytexas,US |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190501165200/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/carrolltoncitytexas,US |archive-date=May 1, 2019 |access-date=January 11, 2012 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder}}</ref><ref name="handbook"/>
