''Chángshā'' is the [[pinyin]] [[romanization of Chinese|romanization]] of the [[Standard Mandarin|Mandarin]] pronunciation of the [[Chinese language|Chinese]] name {{nowrap|{{linktext|長沙}}}} or {{nowrap|{{linktext|长沙}}}}, meaning "long sandy place". The name's origin is unknown. It is attested as early as the 11th {{nowrap|century BC}}, when a vassal lord of the area sent [[King Cheng of Zhou]] a gift described as a "Changsha [[softshell turtle]]" ({{zh|s=长沙{{linktext|鳖}} |t=長沙{{linktext|鼈}} |hp=Chángshā biē |labels=no}}). In the 2nd century AD, historian [[Ying Shao]] wrote that the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] use of the name "Changsha" for the area was a continuance of its old name.<ref>{{cite book |script-title=zh:中国古今地名大词典 |trans-title=Dictionary of Chinese Place-names Ancient and Modern |location=Shanghai |publisher=[[Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House]] |year=2005 |page=505}}</ref> The name originally described the area. The Chu metropolis was known as '''Qingyang'''. The capital of the [[Kingdom of Changsha]]{{mdash}}within the present-day city of Changsha{{mdash}}was known as '''Linxiang''', meaning "[place] Overlooking the [[Xiang River]]".

Numerous examples of pottery and other objects have been discovered.

Later Chinese legends related that the [[Yan Emperor|Flame]] and [[Yellow Emperor]]s visited the area. [[Sima Qian]]'s [[Records of the Grand Historian|history]] states that the Yellow Emperor granted his eldest son [[Shaohao]] the lands of Changsha and its neighbors. During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] (8th{{ndash}}5th century{{nbsp}}BC), the [[Baiyue|Yue culture]] spread into the area around Changsha. During the succeeding [[Warring States period]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]] took control of Changsha. Its capital, Qingyang, became an important southern outpost of the kingdom. In 1951–57 archaeologists explored numerous large and medium-sized Chu tombs from the Warring States Era. More than 3,000 tombs have been discovered. Under the [[Qin dynasty]] {{nowrap|(221–206 BC)}}, Changsha was a staging post for expeditions south into [[Guangdong]] that led to its conquest and the establishment of the [[Nanyue]] kingdom.

Under the [[Han dynasty|Han]] {{nowrap|(3rd century BC –}} {{nowrap|3rd century AD),}} Linxiang was the capital of the [[kingdom of Changsha]]. At first this was a [[client state]] held by [[Liu Bang]]'s [[Baiyue]] ally [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]] that served as a means of controlling the restive Chu people and as a [[buffer state]] against Nanyue. By {{nowrap|202 BC,}} Linxiang had [[Chinese city walls|city walls]] to protect it against uprisings and invasions. The famous [[Mawangdui]] tombs were constructed between 186 and {{nowrap|165 BC.}} [[Xin Zhui|Lady Xin Zhui]] was buried in the earliest tomb {{nowrap|(No. 2)}} and, during its excavation in the 1970s, was found to have been very well preserved. More importantly, the tombs included the earliest surviving copies of the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' and other important literary and historical documents.

When Wu Rui's descendant Wu Zhu {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|吳|著}}}},}} ''Wú Zhù'') died childless in {{nowrap|157 BC}}, the kingdom was granted to a cadet branch of the [[Chinese emperors family tree (early)#Han dynasty, Xin dynasty and Shu Han|imperial family]] as their fief. The kingdom was abolished under [[Wang Mang]]'s short-lived [[Xin dynasty]] and briefly revived by the [[Eastern Han dynasty|Eastern Han]]. In {{nowrap|AD 33,}} its prince was demoted and the area administered as {{ill|Linxiang County, Hunan|lt=Linxiang County|zh|临湘县 (西汉)}} and [[Changsha Commandery]].

Following the turmoil of the [[Three Kingdoms]], [[Emperor Wu of Jin]] granted Changsha to his sixth son [[Sima Ai|Sima Yi]]. The local government had over 100 counties at the beginning of the dynasty. Over the course of the dynasty, the local government of Changsha lost control over a few counties, leaving them to local rule.

The [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] dynasty (6th century) renamed Xiangzhou to Changsha [[Tan Prefecture (Hunan)|Tan Prefecture]] or Tanzhou. It was named after Zhaotan in the ninth year of Emperor Kaihuang (589 A.D.) of the Sui dynasty, and the Tanzhou General Manager was established. During the reign of Emperor Yang of the Sui dynasty, Tanzhou was abolished, and Changsha County, a first-level administrative unit, was established, but the jurisdiction area was reduced.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Murck |first=Alfreda |date=1996 |title=The "Eight Views of Xiao-Xiang" and the Northern Song Culture of Exile |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23496050 |journal=Journal of Song-Yuan Studies |issue=26 |pages=113–144 |jstor=23496050 |issn=1059-3152 |access-date=17 November 2022 |archive-date=17 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221117143852/https://www.jstor.org/stable/23496050 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Changsha's 3-tier administration was simplified to a 2-tier state and county system, eliminating the middle canton region.{{clarify|date=August 2019}} Under the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]], Changsha prospered as a center of trade between central China and [[Southeast Asia]] but suffered during the [[Anshi Rebellion]], when it fell to the rebels.

In early 10th century, Changsha served as the capital of the state of [[Ma Chu|Nanchu]] (南楚), or Southern Chu, established by Ma Yin (马殷) in 907, one of the ten southern war loads. Nanchu, lasted about 50 years, was the only independent state in the history that has ever been built in Hunan with Changsha as the capital, being eventually overthrown by Nantang (南唐) in 951.

Under the [[Song dynasty]], the [[Yuelu Academy]] was founded in 976. It was destroyed by war in 1127 and rebuilt in 1165, during which year the celebrated philosopher [[Zhu Xi]] taught there. It was again destroyed by the [[Mongols]] during the establishment of the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] before being restored in the late 15th century under the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]].

=== Modern history ===
[[File:天心阁01.jpg|thumb|left|Tianxin Pavilion, from where [[Taiping Heavenly Kingdom]] made an attack on Changsha]]
Under the [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] (17th–20th centuries), Changsha was the capital of Hunan and prospered as one of China's chief rice markets. During the [[Taiping Rebellion]], the city was besieged by the rebels in 1852 or 1854{{which|date=August 2019}} for three months but never fell. The rebels moved on to [[Wuhan]], but Changsha then became the principal base for the government's suppression of the rebellion.

The 1903 [[Treaty of Shanghai]] between the Qing and [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] empires opened the city to foreign trade effective 1904. [[Most favored nation]] clauses in other [[unequal treaties]] extended the Japanese gains to the Western powers as well. Consequently, international capital entered the town and factories, churches, and schools were built. A college was started by [[Yale University|Yale]] alumni, which later became a medical centre named Xiangya and a secondary school named the [[Yali School]].

[[File:文夕大火6.jpg|right|thumb|[[1938 Changsha Fire]]]]
Following the [[Xinhai Revolution]], further development followed the opening of the railway to [[Hankou District|Hankou]] in [[Hubei]] province in 1918, which was later extended to [[Guangzhou]] in [[Guangdong Province]] in 1936. Although Changsha's population grew, the city remained primarily commercial in character. Before 1937, it had little industry apart from some small [[cotton]]-[[textile]], glass, and [[nonferrous]]-metal plants and [[handicraft]] enterprises.

[[Mao Zedong]], the founder of the [[China|People's Republic of China]], began his political career in Changsha. He was a student at the Hunan Number 1 Teachers' Training School from 1913 to 1918. He later returned as a teacher and principal from 1920 to 1922. The school was destroyed during the [[Chinese Civil War]] but has since been restored. The former office of the Hunan [[Communist Party]] Central Committee where Mao Zedong once lived is now a museum that includes Mao's living quarters, photographs and other historical items from the 1920s.

Until May 1927, communist support remained strong in Changsha before the massacre carried out by the [[right-wing]] faction of the [[National Revolutionary Army|KMT]] troops. The faction owed its allegiance to [[Chiang Kai-shek]] during its offensive against the KMT's [[left-wing]] faction under [[Wang Jingwei]], who was then allied closely with the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]]. The purge of communists and suspected communists was part of Chiang's plans for consolidating his hold over the KMT, weakening Wang's control, and thereby over the entire China. In a period of twenty days, Chiang's forces killed more than ten thousand people in Changsha and its outskirts.

During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–45), Changsha's strategic location made it the focus of four campaigns by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] to capture it from the [[National Revolutionary Army|Nationalist Army]]: these campaigns were the [[Battle of Changsha (1939)|1st Changsha]],<ref>Van De Ven, Hans J., ''War and Nationalism in China, 1925–1945'', pg. 237.</ref> the [[Battle of Changsha (1941)|2nd Changsha]], the [[Battle of Changsha (1942)|3rd Changsha]], and the [[Battle of Changsha (1944)|4th Changsha]].

Following the [[Communist Party of China|Communist]] victory in the [[Chinese Civil War]], Changsha slowly recovered from its former damage. Since [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s [[Reform and Opening Up Policy]], Changsha has rapidly developed since the 1990s, becoming one of the important cities in the central and western regions. At the end of 2007, Changsha, Zhuzhou, and Xiangtan received approval from the State Council for the "[[Greater Changsha Metropolitan Region|Chang-Zhu-Tan]] (Greater Changsha) Resource-Saving and Environment-Friendly Society Comprehensive Reform Pilot Area", an important engine in the [[Rise of Central China Plan|Rise of Central China plan]]. In 2015, [[Xiangjiang New Area]] was approved as a national [[New Area (China)|new area]].

Changsha is in northeast Hunan Province, the lower reaches of the [[Xiang River]] and the western part of the ''Changliu Basin''. It lies between 111°53' to 114°15' east longitude and 27°51' to 28°41' north latitude. The city borders [[Yichun, Jiangxi|Yichun]] and [[Pingxiang]] of [[Jiangxi|Jiangxi Province]] in the east, [[Zhuzhou]] and [[Xiangtan]] in the south, [[Loudi]] and [[Yiyang]] in the west, and [[Yueyang]] and [[Yiyang]] in the north. It is about 230 kilometres from east to west and about 88 kilometres from north to south. Changsha covers an area of {{convert|11819|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, of which the urban area of {{convert|2150.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, the urban built-up area is {{convert|374.64|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}. Changsha's highest point is Mount Qixing ({{lang|zh-hans|七星岭}}) in [[Daweishan|Daweishan Town]], {{convert|1607.9|m|abbr=on}}. The lowest point is Zhanhu ({{lang|zh-Hans-CN|湛湖}}) in [[Qiaokou Town]], {{convert|23.5|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name="natural environment">{{cite web |quote=Section 1-1, "{{lang|zh-Hans|自然环境}}" (Natural environment) |script-title=zh:长沙统计年鉴2017 |url=http://tjj.changsha.gov.cn/zstj/tjsj/tjnj/2017/1.htm |publisher=[[Government of Changsha]] |language=zh-cn |access-date=2019-12-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180417023435/http://tjj.changsha.gov.cn/zstj/tjsj/tjnj/2017/1.htm |archive-date=17 April 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The [[Xiang River|Xiang]] is the main river in the city, running {{convert|74|km|abbr=on}} northward through the territory. 15 tributaries flow into the Xiang, of which the [[Liuyang River|Liuyang]], [[Laodao River|Laodao]], [[Jin River (Xiang River)|Jinjiang]] and [[Wei River (Xiang tributary)|Wei]] are the four largest.<ref name="natural environment"/> The Xiang divides the city into two parts. The eastern part is mainly commercial and the west is mainly cultural and educational. On 10 October 2001, the seat of Changsha City was transferred from ''Fanzheng Street'' to ''Guanshaling''. Since then, the economy of both sides of the Xiang River has achieved a balanced development.<ref>[http://hunan.sina.com.cn/city/whyq/2013-05-08/125851276.html?from=wap sina.com (2013-5-8)] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180419184003/http://hunan.sina.com.cn/city/whyq/2013-05-08/125851276.html?from=wap |date=19 April 2018 }}[http://www.china-zjj.net/html/20120328/20120328164045.htm china-zjj] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180420010359/http://www.china-zjj.net/html/20120328/20120328164045.htm |date=20 April 2018 }}</ref>

=== Hydrology ===
Most of the rivers in Changsha belong to the Xiang River system. In addition to the Xiangjiang River, 15 tributaries flow into the Xiang, mainly including Liuyang River, Laodao River, Minjiang River, and Qinshui River.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.xinli110.com/luyoi/mjxz/hunan/201209/321713.html|title=Changsha.|website=www.xinli110.com|access-date=2019-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117012943/http://www.xinli110.com/luyoi/mjxz/hunan/201209/321713.html|archive-date=17 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> 302 tributaries are more than five kilometers long, including 289 in the Xiang River Basin. According to the tributary grading there are 24 primary tributaries, 128 secondary tributaries, 118 third tributaries, and 32 tributaries; and 13 are Zijiang water systems; a fairly complete water system is formed, and the river network is densely distributed. Hydrological characteristics of Changsha: the water system is complete, the river network dense; the water volume greater, the water energy resources abundant; the winter not frozen, and the sediment content small.<ref name="changsha.gov.cn">{{Cite web|url=http://www.changsha.gov.cn/zjcs/kncs/zyhj/|title=Environmental Resources in Changsha|website=www.changsha.gov.cn|access-date=2019-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180814053435/http://www.changsha.gov.cn/zjcs/kncs/zyhj/|archive-date=14 August 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Geological characteristics ===
The geological features of Changsha City are: the formation is fully exposed, the granite body is widely distributed, and the geological structure is complex. The strata of each geological and historical period are exposed in Changsha City, and the oldest stratum was formed about one billion years ago. About 600 million years ago, Changsha was a sea, but the sea was not deep. Later, seawater gradually withdrew from the east and west, and most of Liuyang, Changsha, and Wangcheng rose out of the sea and became the northwestern edge of the ancient land of Jiangnan. About 140 million years ago, the sea leaching in the Changsha area ended and it became a land. Due to the influence of crustal movement and geological structure, a long-shaped mountain depression basin, the Chang (Sha) Ping (Jiang) Basin, was formed. Beginning of the new generation, the entire Changping Basin has risen to land. About 3.5 million years ago, the third ice age occurred on the earth, and Liuyang retained the remains of glacier landforms.<ref name="changsha.gov.cn"/>

== Climate ==

Changsha has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Cfa''), with annual average temperature being at {{convert|17.8|°C|1}}, with a mean of {{convert|5.3|°C|1}} in January and {{convert|29.4|°C|1}} in July. Average annual precipitation is {{convert|1499|mm|1}}, with a 275-day frost-free period. With a monthly possible-sunshine percentage ranging from 20% in January to 53% in July, the city receives 1,532.8 hours of bright sunshine annually. The four seasons are distinct. The summers are long and very hot, with heavy rainfall, and autumn is comfortable and is the driest season. Winter is chilly and overcast with lighter rainfall more likely than downpours; cold snaps occur with temperatures occasionally dropping below freezing. Spring is especially rainy and humid with the sun shining less than 30% of the time. The minimum temperature ever recorded since 1951 at the current Wangchengpo Weather Observing Station was {{convert|−12.0|°C|°F}}, recorded on 9 February 1972. The maximum was {{convert|40.6|°C|°F}} on 13 August 1953 and 2 August 2003 [the unofficial record of {{convert|43.0|°C|°F}} was set on 10 August 1934].

[[File:201906 Malanshan HBS Culture City.jpg|thumb|[[Hunan Broadcasting System]] main building]]

=== Media ===
[[Hunan Broadcasting System]] is China's largest television after China Central Television (CCTV). Its headquarters is in Changsha and produces some of the most popular programs in China, including [[Super Girl (TV series)|''Super Girl'']]. These programs have also brought a new entertainment industry into the city, which includes singing bars, dance clubs, theater shows, as well as related businesses including hair salons, fashion stores, and shops for hot spicy snacks at night (especially during summer). While Changsha has developed into an entertainment hub, the city has also become increasingly westernized and has attracted a growing number of foreigners.

=== Cuisine ===
Various types of cuisine are found in Changsha, yet the hot and spicy [[Hunan cuisine]] typical of the region remains the most popular.  The snack chain [[Juewei Duck Neck]], which now has over 10,000 outlets, originates from Changsha.

The city has its own [[siu yeh]] culture.

In May 2008, the BBC broadcast, as part of its ''Storyville'' documentary series, the four-part ''The Biggest Chinese Restaurant in the World'', which explored the inner workings of the 5,000-seating-capacity [[West Lake Restaurant]] (''Xihu Lou Jiujia'') in Changsha.

During the Warring States period, Qu Yuan, a great patriotic poet, recorded many dishes in Hunan in his famous poem "The Soul"({{lang|zh|招魂}}). During the Western Han dynasty, there were 109 varieties of dishes in Hunan, and there were nine categories of cooking methods. After the Six Dynasties, Hunan's food culture was rich and active. The Ming and Qing dynasties are the golden age for the development of Hunan cuisine. The unique style of Hunan cuisine is basically a foregone conclusion. At the end of the Qing dynasty, there were two kinds of Hunan cuisine restaurants in Changsha. In the early years of the Republic of China, the famous Dai (Yang Ming) School, Sheng (Shan Zhai) School, Xiao (Lu Song) School, and Zuyu School appeared in various genres, which laid the historical status of Hunan cuisine. Since the founding of New China, especially since the reform and opening up, it has been better developed.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.china.com.cn/news/zhuanti/zhcx/2007-09/26/content_8954971.htm|title=Hunan cuisine|website=www.china.com.cn|access-date=2019-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116174649/http://www.china.com.cn/news/zhuanti/zhcx/2007-09/26/content_8954971.htm|archive-date=16 November 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>
