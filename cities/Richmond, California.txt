'''Richmond''' is a city in western [[Contra Costa County, California]], United States. The city was [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] on August 3, 1905, and has a [[Richmond, California, City Council|city council]].<ref name="ecrailhist">[http://elcerritowire.com/history/pages/railchron.pdf East Shore and Suburban Railway Chronology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200642/http://elcerritowire.com/history/pages/railchron.pdf|date=September 27, 2007}}, ''[[El Cerrito Historical Society]]'', June 2007.

Richmond is one of two cities, the other being [[San Rafael, California|San Rafael]], that sits on the shores of both [[San Francisco Bay]] and [[San Pablo Bay]]. Its population was 116,448 as of the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]] making it the second largest city in the United States named Richmond after [[Richmond, Virginia]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Richmond city, California|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=1600000US0660620|website=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=September 16, 2022}}</ref>

==Etymology==
The name "Richmond" predates incorporation of the city by more than fifty years. [[Edmund Randolph (ante bellum jurist)|Edmund Randolph]], originally from [[Richmond, Virginia]], represented the city of San Francisco when California's first legislature met in San Jose in December 1849, and he became state assemblyman from San Francisco. Out of fondness for his hometown, Randolph persuaded a federal surveying party, surveying and mapping the San Francisco Bay, to place the names "Point Richmond" and "Richmond" on their 1854 geodetic coastal map. The map was used at the terminal selected by the [[San Francisco and San Joaquin Valley Railroad]]. By 1899 maps made by the railroad carried the name "Point Richmond Avenue", a county road that later became Barrett Avenue, a central street in Richmond. The [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad]] purchased the railroad making their terminus at Richmond.<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|689}}</ref> The first post office opened in 1900,<ref name=CGN /> and the city of Richmond [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1905.

==History==
[[File:Don_Víctor_Castro.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Richmond was originally part of [[Rancho San Pablo]], a Mexican-era [[ranchos of California|rancho]] granted to [[Francisco María Castro]] in 1823 and reconfirmed to his son Don [[Víctor Castro (landowner)|Víctor Castro]], a noted [[Californio]] ranchero and politician (pictured), in 1834.]]

The [[Ohlone]] were the first inhabitants of the Richmond area, settling an estimated 5,000 years ago.<ref name="History of Richmond">{{cite web | title = History of Richmond | publisher = City of Richmond | url = https://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/112/History-of-Richmond | access-date = June 25, 2007}}</ref> They spoke the [[Chochenyo language]],<ref name="UCB Linguistics">{{Cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/chochenyo.php|title=Chochenyo – Survey of California and Other Indian Language|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|date=2016|access-date=August 28, 2017}}</ref> and subsisted as [[hunter-gatherer]]s and [[harvest]]ers.<ref>Controlled burning as harvesting, Brown 1973:3,4,25; Levy 1978:491; Stanger, 1969:94; Bean and Lawton, 1973:11,30,39 (Lewis).

===Origins===
The site that would eventually become the city of Richmond was part of the [[Rancho San Pablo]] land granted to Don [[Francisco María Castro]], from which the nearby town of San Pablo inherited its name; the [[Point Richmond]] area was known originally as The Potrero and then renamed as Point Stevens in early charts of [[San Francisco Bay]].<ref name=PtRichHist/> Point Richmond was an island, but industrial development and deliberate fill connected it to the mainland by the early 1900s.<ref name=PtRichHist/>

On July 4, 1900, the [[Santa Fe Railroad]]'s western terminus was established at Point Richmond with ferry connections from Ferry Point in the Brickyard Cove area to San Francisco.<ref name=PtRichHist/> The Santa Fe railroad also built a major rail yard next to Point Richmond. It constructed a tunnel through the Potrero San Pablo ridge to run track from the yard to a ferry landing from which freight cars could be transshipped to San Francisco. Where this track crosses the main street in Point Richmond, there remain two of the last operational [[Wigwag (railroad)|wigwag]] grade crossing signals in the United States, and the only surviving examples of the "upside-down" type. The wigwag is a type of railroad crossing signal that was phased out in the 1970s and '80s across the country. There was controversy in 2005 when the State Transportation Authority ordered the BNSF railroad company to upgrade the railroad crossing signals. A compromise was achieved that included installing new modern crossing gates, red lights and bells while not removing, but simply shutting off, the historic ones and preserving their functionality for special events.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.baycrossings.com/Archives/2002/06_July/going_wiggy_over_wig-wags.htm |title=Going Wiggy over Wig-Wags – Pt.

[[Standard Oil]] set up operations on land sold by Emily Tewksbury in 1901, including what is now the [[Chevron Richmond Refinery]] and [[Oil depot|tank farm]], which [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]] still operates. There is a pier into San Francisco Bay south of [[Point Molate Beach Park|Point Molate]] for oil tankers.

===Early days===
The city of Richmond was incorporated in 1905.<ref name=PtRichHist>{{cite web |url=https://www.pointrichmondhistory.org/PDF_Other/history.html |title=A Brief History of Point Richmond |author=Roselius, Donna |publisher=The Point Richmond History Association |access-date=March 9, 2023}}</ref> Until the enactment of prohibition in 1919, the city had the largest [[winery]] in the world;<ref name="SFC20080629"/> the small abandoned village of [[Winehaven, California|Winehaven]] remains fenced off along Western Drive in the [[Point Molate Beach Park|Point Molate Area]]. Richmond was a small town at that time, with some industrial development centered on the waterfront based around the railroad and oil refineries.

The [[Pullman Company]] also established a major facility in Richmond in the early 20th century.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.pullmanshops.com |title= Pullman Shop official website |publisher= Pullmanshops.com |access-date= February 19, 2013}}</ref> The facility connected with both the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific and serviced their passenger coach equipment. The Pullman Company was a large employer of African American men, who worked mainly as [[porter (railroad)|porters]] on the Pullman cars.<ref>{{cite web |first= Lyn |last= Hughes |url= http://www.aphiliprandolphmuseum.com |title= A.

===Wartime boomtown and shifting demographics===
At the onset of [[World War II]], the four [[Richmond Shipyards]] were built along Richmond's waterfront, employing thousands of workers, many migrating to Richmond from other parts of the country after being recruited. These new workers generally lived in housing constructed specifically for the wartime boom, scattered throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, including Richmond, Berkeley and Albany. Many of these new migrants were [[Great Migration (African American)|Black Americans from the South and to a lesser extent the Midwest]] who took jobs in heavy industry and transport as those industries expanded to meet the needs of the war economy, while increased numbers of women also joined the industrial workforce for the first time as large numbers of working-age men were drafted for the war effort. During the war, Richmond's population increased dramatically, rising from 23,000 in 1940 to 114,899 in 1942 and peaking at around 120,000 by 1945.<ref name=Graves>{{cite report |url=http://www.tombutt.com/pdf/mapping%20richmond%20final.pdf |title=Mapping Richmond's World War II Home Front |author=Graves, Donna |date=July 2004 |publisher=National Park Service, Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park |access-date=March 8, 2023}}</ref>{{rp|3}}

A specially built rail line, the [[Shipyard Railway]], transported workers to the shipyards. Kaiser's Richmond shipyards built 747 [[Victory ship|Victory]] and [[Liberty ship]]s for the war effort, more than any other site in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web | title = Rosie the Riveter – World War II Home Front National Historical Park: World War II in the San Francisco Bay Area | publisher =National Park Service | url = http://www.nps.gov/nr/travel/wwIIbayarea/ros.htm | access-date = June 26, 2007}}</ref> The shipyards broke many records, including the completion of a Liberty ship in just five days. On average the yards built a new ship in 30 days.

The medical system established for the shipyard workers at the [[Richmond Field Hospital]] eventually became today's [[Kaiser Permanente]] [[HMO]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Hendricks |first=Rickey |title=A Model for National Health Care: The History of Kaiser Permanente |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey |publisher=Rutgers University Press |date=1993 |pages=40–47, 63}}</ref> The hospital remained in operation until 1993, when it was replaced by the [[Richmond Medical Center]] hospital, which has since expanded to a multi-building campus.

Point Richmond was Richmond's original commercial hub, but a new downtown arose in the center of the city along Macdonald Avenue during the war. It was populated by department stores such as [[S. H. Kress & Co.|Kress]], [[J.C. Penney]], [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]], [[Macy's]], and [[F.W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]].

===Post-war decline and rebound===
When the war ended the shipyard workers were no longer needed, and a decades-long population decline ensued. The census listed 99,545 residents in 1950. By 1960 much of the temporary housing built for the shipyard workers was torn down, and the population dropped to about 71,800.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bayareacensus.ca.gov/cities/Richmond50.htm |title=City of Richmond, Contra Costa County |website=Bay Area Census |access-date=March 15, 2023}}</ref>

In the late 1990s the [[Richmond Parkway (California)|Richmond Parkway]] was built along Richmond's western industrial and northwestern parkland, connecting Interstates 80 and 580. Construction of the Parkway, which follows the alignment of [[California State Route 93|SR&nbsp;93]] as proposed in 1958, started in 1990 and completed in 1996 at a cost of $193&nbsp;million. However, [[California Department of Transportation|Caltrans]] issued a letter in 1998 saying it would not take over responsibility for the road unless it was brought up to expressway standards; as it was cost-prohibitive to convert it, the road remains the responsibility of the city and county.{{cn|date=October 2024}}

In 2006, the city celebrated its centennial. This coincided with the repaving and streetscaping project of [[Macdonald Avenue]]. The city's old rundown commercial district along Macdonald has been designated the city's "Main Street District" by the state of California. This has led to funding of improvements in the form of state grants.<ref>{{cite press release |url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/premium/0199/0199-853061.html |title=TTCA Welcomes the City of Richmond Into the California Main Street Program. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121045342/http://goliath.ecnext.com/premium/0199/0199-853061.html |archive-date=November 21, 2007 |publisher=Business Wire |date=December 13, 2007 |access-date=May 24, 2007}}</ref>

===Climate===
Richmond, like much of the coastal [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], enjoys a very mild [[Mediterranean climate]] year round. The climate is slightly warmer than the coastal areas of San Francisco, [[San Francisco Peninsula|the Peninsula]], and Marin County; it is however more temperate than areas further inland. The average highs range from {{convert|57|to|73|°F|°C|abbr=on}} and the lows range from {{convert|43|to|56|°F|°C|abbr=on}} year round.<ref name="richmondweather">[http://www.weather.com/outlook/health/allergies/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USCA0936?from=dayDetails_bottomnav_allergies Average Weather for Richmond, California], Weather.com. {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522122355/http://www.weather.com/outlook/health/allergies/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USCA0936?from=dayDetails_bottomnav_allergies |date=May 22, 2011 }}</ref> Richmond usually enjoys an "[[Indian summer]]", and September is, on average, the warmest month. January is on average the coldest month.

The highest recorded temperature in Richmond was {{convert|107|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in September 1971 while the coldest was {{convert|24|°F|°C|abbr=on}} in December 1990.<ref name="richmondweather"/>

The rainy season begins in late October and ends in April, with some showers in May. Most of the rain occurs during stronger storms which occur between November and March and drop {{convert|3.3-4.91|in|mm}} of rain per month. January and February are the rainiest months.<ref name="richmondweather"/>

Like most of the Bay Area, Richmond is made up of several [[microclimate]]s. Southern parts of the city and the ridges receive more [[fog]] than northern areas. Summer temperatures are higher in inland areas, where the moderating influence of San Francisco Bay is lessened. The average wind speed is {{convert|6-9|mph|4=0}} with stronger winds from March through August; the strongest winds are in June.<ref name="richmonddata"/> The city also enjoys more than 80% sunshine seven months out of the year and ten months with 60% or more. December and January are the darkest months with about 45% average brightness.<ref name="richmonddata"/> The city experiences virtually no snowfall, and brief hail annually.

Richmond lies in the volatile California region that has a potential for devastating earthquakes. Many buildings were damaged in the 1989 [[Loma Prieta earthquake]]. The city has also had at least one minor tornado. The [[Chevron Richmond Refinery]] had highly noted chemical leaks in the 1990s.

Many industries have been and are still sited in Richmond. It had a [[dynamite]] and [[gunpowder]] works (the [[Giant Powder Company]], closed in 1960, now the site of [[Point Pinole Regional Shoreline]]), the last active [[whaling]] station in the country at Point Molate (closed in 1971), and one of the world's largest [[wineries]] ([[Winehaven, California|Winehaven]]), closed by [[Prohibition]] in 1919.

During World War II, Richmond developed rapidly as a heavy industrial town, chiefly devoted to [[shipbuilding]]. Its major activity now is as a [[seaport]], with 26 million [[ton]]s of goods shipped through [[Port Richmond, California|Port Richmond]] in 1993, mostly oil and petroleum products. The seaport is also home to [[Chevron Richmond Refinery|a major oil refinery]] operated by [[Chevron Corporation]]. The [[Social Security Administration]] employs over 1,000 at its regional office and program service center in Downtown Richmond. [[Kaiser Permanente]]'s [[Richmond Medical Center]] hospital in the Downtown Richmond is one of the largest employers in the city.

In the [[Downtown Richmond, Richmond, California|Downtown Richmond District]] the Richmond Shopping Center was built as part of the city's "''main street''" revitalization efforts.

The [[Macdonald 80 Shopping Center]] is a commercial plot along the trunk route of Macdonald Avenue which has been designated the city's main street under the aforementioned program. It was once anchored by the now-defunct Montgomery Wards and a Toys"R"Us. Demolition of the former buildings and construction of a new shopping mall were completed in 2006.<ref>{{cite web

===Redevelopment===
[[File:Point Richmond Historic District-7.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Point Richmond Historic District|Pt. Richmond Historic District]]]]
The former [[Richmond Shipyards|Richmond Shipyard No.&nbsp;2]] and Inner Harbor were transformed starting in the late 1980s into a multiunit residential area, now known as [[Marina Bay, Richmond, California|Marina Bay]]. Starting in the early 2000s, the city began an aggressive redevelopment effort spurring exurban tract housing, condominiums, townhomes, a [[Richmond Station (California)|transit village]], and terraced hillside subdivisions. The city also created a [[redevelopment agency]] that refurbished [[Macdonald Avenue]], funded the Metro Walk transit village, resurrected the [[Macdonald 80 Shopping Center]], and created the [[Richmond Greenway]] [[rails-to-trails]] trail and [[urban farming]] project. Since 1996, new homes have increased in price by 32%,<ref name="richmonddata"/> and there has been a 65.6% increase in the total amount of new dwellings built annually.

Country Club Vista is a development surrounding the Richmond Country Club to the south and north. It includes suburban style tract houses with cul-de-sac courts and small yards. Seacliff, at Point Richmond, is a development of luxury waterfront homes built on a terraced hillside. San Marcos is a series of about ten condominium multistory buildings between The Shops at Hilltop and Country Club Vista. Richmond Transit Village has been constructed in the former west parking lot and an adjacent empty lot of the combined Richmond BART and Amtrak station.

The city of Richmond has eight community centers which are located within city parks.<ref name="infosys"/> Many of the city's community centers were closed in the early 2000s following budget miscalculations and financial difficulties.

That election also featured a city sales tax increase, Measure Q, which failed.

There are 53 voting precincts in Richmond. Richmond has formerly been home to black culture and activist movements, most notably the [[Black Panther Party]].

The city of Richmond has dozens of parks, national historic parks, and 10 sites listed under the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name="nris">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>

===Point Richmond===
[[File:Point Richmond, Richmond, California.jpg|thumb|Point Richmond is one of the city's widely known neighborhoods; the Richmond Chevron Refinery and the marshlands are in the background.]]
[[Point Richmond]], a neighborhood in Richmond, is known for its small-town appearance. ''The Point'', as it is known by locals, offers owner-operated stores, coffee shops, historic benches, and streetlights. [[The Masquers Playhouse]] is a performing arts center that offers shows and productions year round. Hotel Mac is one of the oldest buildings in the area and has classic early 20th century architecture, like many other buildings in the area. There is also [[The Plunge]], a natatorium which had been closed due to seismic safety issues but was re-opened in August 2010 after the retrofitting was completed. The city expressed a desire to demolish the building at one point, but this was halted by the actions of a neighborhood preservation campaign which continues its mission to "''Save the Plunge!''".

The [[Richmond–San Rafael Bridge]] extends {{convert|5.5|mi|km|1}} across San Pablo Bay, entering Richmond just to the north of Point Richmond. The bridge is the origin of the term ''rollercoaster span'', due to its curves, bumps, and appearance, which have also earned the bridge the nickname of ''the rollercoaster bridge''. It was completed in 1957, and connects Contra Costa County with [[Marin County]]. Automobiles are charged a [[USD|$]]6 toll in the westbound (towards Marin) direction only.

The Richmond Chevron Refinery occupies most of the land north of Point Richmond and the eastern end of the bridge. Some areas of this northern section are protected and publicly accessible, including Point Molate Beach Park, a park on the western coast of Richmond along Western Drive. It was originally a Chinese shrimp camp in the 1870s. On the northern end, near [[Point San Pablo]], there is a yacht harbor that accommodates hundreds of private boats.

===Brickyard Cove===
The Ferry Point Tunnel is one of the oldest tunnels in California, connecting Point Richmond with Brickyard Cove to the south. Built in 1899, this structure still gives access to many attractions and neighborhoods in Brickyard Cove. The tunnel goes to the Golden State Railroad Museum, the USS ''Red Oak Victory'', and many beaches and parks, and to Ferry Point where an abandoned ferry-rail pier stands with a historic ferry slip still standing, though somewhat damaged by fire. It can be viewed from an adjacent fishing pier.

[[File:VIEW OF REAR OF FREIGHT HOUSE AND SANTA FE RAILROAD DEPOT, FACING WEST - Santa Fe Railroad Depot, 101 Garrard Boulevard, Richmond, Contra Costa County, CA HABS CAL,7-RICH,5-6.tif|thumb|right|Santa Fe Railroad Depot]]
The Santa Fe Railroad established ferry service to San Francisco in 1900 and later built a station that operated as the western terminus for the railroad from 1903 to 1992. It has now been transformed into a museum to exemplify the feel of the terminal in that era. The [[Golden State Railroad Museum]] is a complex series of model railroad layouts in a museum in the Brickyard Cove area of Point Richmond. A visitor can operate trains of various eras, and there are miniature freight and passenger terminals, trestles, tunnels, and meticulously detailed town and city scenes, many of which are copied from real life scenes of the 1950s.

Keller Beach is one of the city's beaches, located at Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline, a park in Brickyard Cove. It offers picnicking, sunbathing, wading, and swimming. The beach is overlooked by vehicles exiting the Brickyard Cove drive, Ferry Point tunnel and houses on the steep cliffs above. The beach, as with most of the cove, offers spectacular panoramic bay views of the Oakland hills, bridges, the San Francisco skyline and the Golden Gate.

===Southern waterfront / Shipyards===
[[File:RedOakVictory2.JPG|thumb|The [[SS Red Oak Victory (AK-235)|''Red Oak Victory'']] at Ferry Point in Brickyard Cove, 2006]]
Further east, the {{USS|Red Oak Victory|AK-235|6}} is a restored World War II [[Victory ship]], the 558th ship made in Richmond. It is moored in the former Richmond Shipyard No. 3. [[Liberty ship|Liberty]] and Victory ships built in Richmond transported troops and supplies during World War II.

East across the Harbor/Santa Fe Channel, the [[Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park]] is in Richmond, and commemorates women's shipbuilding and support for the war effort in the 1940s. The visitor's center is in a small utility building next to the former Ford Assembly Plant. Regular ferry service is provided to San Francisco from the [[Richmond Ferry Terminal]] via [[San Francisco Bay Ferry]].

This area is connected by the [[San Francisco Bay Trail]] to several city parks along the waterfront, including Lucretia Edwards Shoreline Park, Marina Bay Park and the Rosie the Riveter Memorial, Barbara and Jay Vincent Park, and Shimada Friendship Park. The Bay Trail continues past these parks further southeast to [[Point Isabel Regional Shoreline]] and beyond to parks in El Cerrito, Albany, and Berkeley.

===Civic Center===
During World War II the city sprawled and its population increased dramatically. This led city leaders to construct the Richmond Civic Center, with buildings completed between 1949 and 1957. This center houses the city hall, a small convention center, library, hall of justice, police headquarters, and arts center.

Architectural Forum magazine called the new Memorial Civic Center: "a milestone in U.S. civic design: it is the first modern Civic Center built in any American city: and it is one of the most comprehensive centers constructed anywhere in the world."<ref>{{Cite web| title = About the library| access-date = 2024-08-12| url = https://www.ci.richmond.ca.us/1128/About-the-Library}}</ref>

The Richmond Public Library, the only public library independent of the Contra Costa County Public Libraries system, lies in the heart of the civic center. It houses over 204,686 books, 4,014 audio materials, 5,277 video materials, and 491 serial subscriptions.<ref name="richmonddata"/>

===Offshore===
East Brother Light Station on East Brother Island (one of the [[The Brothers (San Francisco Bay)|Brother Islands]]) is host to an exclusive [[bed and breakfast]]. It is only accessible by private boat. Visitors come and stay for the day and picnic for free or they may pay for a room.

The [[Richmond Art Center]], founded by [[Hazel Salmi]] in 1936, is one of the oldest continually operating non-profit art centers on the entire West Coast of the United States. Its programming includes exhibitions, adult and youth education, and community initiatives. The center currently provides some of the only visual arts education programming in the city of Richmond, relying primarily on public donations and private grants as its means of support.

There is also the East Bay Center for the Performing Arts, Hilltop Multiplex, or Masquers Theaters in Point Richmond.

===Parks and recreation===
[[File:kellerbeach1.jpg|thumb|Beachgoers wading at [[Keller Beach]] in [[Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline]] in southern Richmond between [[Point Richmond]] and [[Brickyard Cove]]]]

The city has {{convert|292.6|acre|km2|1}} of parkland, which constitutes 1.5% of the city's land territory. The [[Rosie the Riveter World War II Home Front National Historical Park]] was established in 2000, encompassing the former Kaiser shipyards and other wartime industrial sites in Richmond. The park is a memorial to the six million women who labored on the home front, symbolized by the mythical figure "Rosie the Riveter". Richmond was selected for the park because it has many intact buildings that were constructed for 56 wartime industries. Its four shipyards produced an amazing 747 large ships and set production records. The home front changed Richmond from a predominantly rural community of 23,600 residents to a diverse population of over 100,000 people within a year. Industries operated around the clock and public housing, schools, day care centers, health care and merchants mobilized to support the new workforce that arrived on the city's doorstep. Fortunately, Richmond's turbulent and productive home front years were well chronicled and photographed. The National Park Service provides interpretive services and operates a Visitor Center in a former utility building next to the Ford Assembly Building.

Richmond also has number of local parks and two large regional parks are under the authority of the East Bay Regional Parks District, a consortium of most of the Parks and Recreation lands and facilities of Alameda and Contra Costa County.

[[Wildcat Canyon Regional Park]] is the city's largest park at {{convert|2428|acre|km2|0}}. The park once housed a dance hall and roller rink and has distinctive stonework throughout, which was the rationale for its placement on the National Register of Historic Places.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ebparks.org/parks/miller_knox |title= Miller/Knox Regional Shoreline &#124; East Bay Regional Parks |publisher= Ebparks.org |access-date= February 19, 2013 |archive-date= February 11, 2013 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130211055049/http://www.ebparks.org/parks/miller_knox |url-status= dead }}</ref> It features San Pablo Creek, trails, forests, horseback riding, picnic areas, and a play structure for children, as well as horses for rent and mountain biking trails. High school students practice cross-country in the park. It is situated in the eastern Richmond hills and stretches into Berkeley's [[Tilden Regional Park]] in Alameda County. The park has diverse animal and plant life including great horned owls, opossums, king snakes, rubber boas, turkey vultures and many others.

[[Point Isabel Regional Shoreline]] is the largest off-leash dog park in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Martin|first=Glen|date=August 16, 2004|title=EAST BAY PARKS AT 70 / Point Isabel Shoreline the largest off-leash dog park in the nation|url=https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/east-bay-parks-at-70-point-isabel-shoreline-the-2701020.php|access-date=February 23, 2023|website=SFGATE|language=en-US}}</ref>

The [[Richmond Greenway]] is a project costing millions of dollars to transform an old rail line into a walking, jogging, and biking trail. It will span east to west from the end of the Ohlone Trail that follows the BART line from El Cerrito to Berkeley. It will also follow the BART line to Richmond station and continue to Point Richmond. Pedestrian bridges will be used to cross major avenues such as San Pablo Avenue and 23rd Street. An additional side project will add a bike lane/bike trail between the Richmond Greenway and the Ohlone trail at Potrero Avenue via 23rd Street, Carlson Boulevard, Cutting Boulevard, and Potrero. It is currently under construction.

Richmond is home to four marinas: the Brickyard Cove Yacht Club, Point San Pablo Yacht Club, Marina Bay Marina, and Channel Marina in the Santa Fe channel. In addition, Richmond has the "Richmond Plunge", a municipal [[natatorium]] dating back to 1926 and which reopened August 14, 2010. The pool is located in the [[Point Richmond, California|Point Richmond]] neighborhood.

* [[San Pablo Avenue]] ([[California State Route 123|State Route 123]]) runs through Richmond and San Pablo to Pinole, Hercules and to its terminus in [[Crockett, California|Crockett]], and south through El Cerrito, Albany, [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], and Berkeley, until it runs into [[Oscar Grant Plaza|Frank Ogawa Plaza]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].

====Major trunk streets====
* [[Macdonald Avenue]] is the "Main Street" of Richmond, running east–west from Atchison Village through downtown to San Pablo Avenue in the [[North & East, Richmond, California|North & East]] neighborhood. In 2010, it was repaved and refitted with new lampposts, street furniture, business façades, landscaping and trees.
* [[Cutting Boulevard]] parallels Macdonald Avenue to the south, traveling from Point Richmond to Arlington Ave. near the top of the hills. It is a busy commercial and commute route. In 1990, a major improvement program was designed by the city also involving Knox Freeway. It is named after the founder of the Port of Richmond, [[Henry Cutting]].

* Barrett Avenue parallels Macdonald Ave two blocks north; it is slightly less traveled and has less activity than Macdonald.
* Marina Bay Parkway serves as a link between I-580 and the Marina Bay neighborhood, it turns into 23rd street after crossing 580.
* Marina Way and Harbour Way/Harbour Way South (formerly 14th Street and 10th Street, respectively) run north–south.
* Giant Highway, named for the former Giant Powder Company, runs in the northern part of town between San Pablo Avenue and the Leroy Heights neighborhood.

===Public transportation===
The city's primary transportation hub is [[Richmond station (California)|Richmond station]]. It is served by [[Bay Area Rapid Transit]] (BART) {{lnl|BART|Red}} and {{lnl|BART|Orange}} service, plus [[Amtrak]] {{lnl|Amtrak|Capitol Corridor}}, {{lnl|Amtrak|San Joaquins}}, and {{lnl|Amtrak|California Zephyr}} [[regional rail]] and [[intercity rail]] service.

The primary bus service in Richmond is operated by [[AC Transit]], which runs 14 bus lines in the city. Service includes a number of local routes, rapid route 72R along San Pablo Avenue, transbay commuter service across the Bay Bridge to the [[Salesforce Transit Center]] and limited [[All Nighter (night bus service)|All-Nighter]] service. Additional local service is operated by [[WestCAT]], including a [[park and ride]] facility at the [[Richmond Parkway Transit Center]]. [[Bear Transit]] provides commuter and student service from El Cerrito del Norte BART station and UC Berkeley to the UC Field Station in Campus Bay on route RFS.<ref name="rfs">[http://pt.berkeley.edu/print/177 RFS schedule] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719153154/http://pt.berkeley.edu/print/177 |date=July 19, 2011 }}, Bear Transit website</ref> Several regional bus operators serve [[El Cerrito del Norte station]] (just south of Richmond) rather than Richmond station because of the former station's proximity to I-80.

Before AC Transit and BART, the [[Key System]] provided a network of several rail lines on the [[East Shore and Suburban Railway]].<ref name="bayrails">[http://www.bayarearails.org/photogal/full.php?id=1327&s=24 keysystemmap.gif] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928101348/http://www.bayarearails.org/photogal/full.php?id=1327&s=24 |date=September 28, 2007 }}, BayRails.

===Commercial and cargo rail===
The [[Union Pacific Railroad]] (UP) has a mainline passing through Richmond. This line was formerly operated by the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] (SP).

The [[BNSF Railway]] (BNSF) has a yard and that serves as the Northern California terminus of their line that goes to their main [[classification yard]] at [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] via the [[San Joaquin Valley]]. The track was formerly operated by the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] (ATSF). Many years ago, the ATSF offered [[rail car ferry]] service from [[Point Richmond]] to San Francisco. The partially burnt remnants of the ferry pier can still be seen at Point Richmond.

The [[Richmond Pacific Railroad]] (RPRC) is a class III shortline railroad operating on {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1}} of track, providing switching services at Richmond's wharves. The RPRC is owned by the Levin-Richmond Terminal Corporation and was formerly known as the Parr Terminal Railroad (PRT).

===Ferry===
[[File:Ferryterminalrichwboat2019.jpg|thumb|Richmond Ferry Terminal]]

The [[San Francisco Bay Ferry]] relaunched ferry service to the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]] in January 2019. The service runs from the Craneway Pavilion in Marina Bay to the San Francisco Ferry Building seven days a week, with lower frequency on the weekends as opposed to higher volume weekday commutes. Schedules call for a 35-minute commute from the Marina Bay Terminal to San Francisco Ferry Building in either direction.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://sanfranciscobayferry.com/richmond-ferry-route | title=Richmond Ferry Route &#124; San Francisco Bay Ferry }}</ref>

Historically, Richmond had commuter ferry service from the Richmond Ferry Terminal to the [[San Francisco Ferry Building]] on weekdays and [[Fisherman's Wharf, San Francisco|Fisherman's Wharf]] on weekends in addition to special [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] [[AT&T Park|Ballpark]] service during the [[MLB|baseball]] season. The voyage took approximately 45 minutes each way. The service began in 1999, but was discontinued in the late 2000s in the economic downturn following the dot-com bust.
