'''Yambio''' is a city in [[South Sudan]].

==Location==
The City is located in Yambio County, [[Western Equatoria State]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/outgoing-police-spokesman-be-gbudwe-state-police-commissioner|title=Outgoing police spokesman to be Western Equatoria State police commissioner|publisher=Radio Tamazuj|date=8 March 2016|access-date=14 August 2016|archive-date=19 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819205119/https://radiotamazuj.org/en/article/outgoing-police-spokesman-be-gbudwe-state-police-commissioner|url-status=dead}}</ref> in southwestern [[South Sudan]], close to the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo–South Sudan border|border]] with the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]]. Its location lies approximately {{convert|444|km|mi}}, by road, west of [[Juba, South Sudan|Juba Capital City of South Sudan]].

==Overview==
Yambio is the headquarters of ''[[Yambio County]]'', in which it lies. It is also the largest City of [[Western Equatoria|Western Equatoria State]], one of the 10 [[states of South Sudan|states]] that constitute the [[Republic of South Sudan]]. Following the attainment of [[independence]] by South Sudan in 2011, the main current concerns in Yambio include the following:<ref name=":0">[http://www.sudantribune.com/Western-Equatoria-state-holds,37757 Immediate Concerns In Yambio In 2011]</ref>

* Resettlement of new South Sudanese returnees especially from the [[Republic of Sudan]], but also from other countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the [[Central African Republic]], and [[Uganda]].
* Security enhancement against the marauding [[Ugandan]] rebels known as the [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA), who have terrorized the region for the past decade or so.
* Ensuring that the old residents and new returnees have enough food, now and in the future.

==Population and demographics==
Yambio and the surrounding communities are the ancestral home of the [[Azande people|Azande]] ethnic group, who also inhabit in neighboring countries of The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] and The [[Central African Republic]]. Apart from the Azande, other tribes in Yambio county include the [[Balanda Bviri people|Balanda]], Mundu and [[Morokodo people|Morokodo]].

In 1983, the Sudanese national census estimated the population of Yambio to be approximately 24,900 people. In 2010, it was estimated that the town's population had risen to about 31,700 people.<ref>[http://www.world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=&lng=de&des=wg&geo=-188&srt=pnan&col=adhoq&msz=1500&men=gcis&lng=en Population Estimates For Yambio (1983 - 2010)]{{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> In 2011, another source estimated the population of the town at about 45,400.<ref>[http://www.geonames.org/363656/yambio.html  Estimated Population of Yambio In 2011]</ref>
