[[File:Province de Thai-Nguyen (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Thai Nguyen province in 1909]]

==Demographics==
According to the General Statistics Office of the Government of Vietnam, the population of Thái Nguyên province as of 2019 was 1,286,751 with a density of 364 people per km<sup>2</sup> over a total land area of {{convert|3526.64|km2|mi2|abbr=on}}. The male population during this period was 629,197 while the female population was 657,554. The rural population was 876,484 against an urban population of 410,267 (about 47% of the rural population).<ref name=census/>

There are about 50 ethnic groups in Thái Nguyên recognized by the Vietnamese government. Each ethnicity has their own language, traditions, and subculture. The largest ethnic groups are: [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] (70.13%), followed by [[Tày people|Tày]], [[Nùng people|Nùng]], [[San Diu people|Sán Dìu]] and [[San Chay people|Sán Chay]]

Demographic distribution varies greatly: population density in the highlands and mountainous regions is low, while that of urban areas is very high. Vo Nhai District has lowest population density with 72 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup> and Thái Nguyên city has the highest with 1,260 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup>.

==Geography==
[[File:Tam Dao mountain range.jpg|thumb|left|Tam Đảo mountain range]]
Thái Nguyên borders six provinces: [[Bắc Kạn Province|Bắc Kạn]], [[Vĩnh Phúc Province|Vĩnh Phúc]], [[Tuyên Quang Province|Tuyên Quang]], [[Lạng Sơn Province|Lạng Sơn]], [[Bắc Giang Province|Bắc Giang]], [[Hanoi]]. Thái Nguyên is the gateway for socio-economic exchange with the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] delta. It is 50&nbsp;km from Noi Bai international airport, 200&nbsp;km from the Chinese border, 75&nbsp;km from the center of Hanoi and 200&nbsp;km from Hai Phong. The exchange is carried out via road, rail and waterways in the province<ref name=Introduction/> Main water features include the Công River and [[Núi Cốc Lake]].
[[File:Nui Coc Lake1.jpg|thumb|left|[[Núi Cốc Lake]]]]
Thái Nguyên has many mountain ranges running from south to north. Their structure is made of strongly decayed rocks with many caves and valleys. In the southwest is the Tam Đảo mountain range, located on the northern fringe of the Red River Delta. The range spans some 80 kilometres, with its highest peak of 1,529 metres<ref name="FV">{{cite web|url=http://www.footprintsvietnam.com/Travel_News/June07/TamDao-NationalPark-Vietnam.htm|title=Tam Dao National Park|publisher=Footprints Vietnam|access-date=2010-08-25}}</ref> (note other sources state 1,590 or 1,592 metres) and many cliffs running from northwest to southeast.

The Tam Đảo mountain region is protected by the [[Tam Đảo National Park]], established in 1996, which is one of the largest national parks in the country.<ref name="FV"/> There are over 20 peaks with the park area, others of note include Thien Thi at 1,375 m, Thach Ban at 1,388 m and Phu Nghia at 1,300 m. Sharp peaks with sloping sides and numerous, deep partitions are characteristic of the topology.  The boundary of the national park is located at an altitude of 100 m around the Tam Đảo range. There is a larger buffer zone (which has area of approximately 535&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) which surrounds the national park which has an altitude below 100 m. Seventy per cent of the area of the park is covered by natural and artificial forest. The natural forest is about 220&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and the human altered forest is about 30&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>

There are two other mountain ranges in the province, both running in a northwest–southeast direction; the Ngan Son range running from Bắc Kạn to Võ Nhai District and the Bac Son range. Many of the mountains of Thái Nguyên province provide shelter for a considerable part from monsoon winds.

===Climate===
With terrain sloping from high mountains to the low zones and midlands, in terms  temperature in winter, Thái Nguyên has three climatic sub-zones. A cold sub-zone in Võ Nhai District, a temperate subzone including Định Hóa, Phú Lương and southern Võ Nhai districts and a warm subzone which includes Đại Từ, Đồng Hỷ, Phú Bình, Phổ Yên City, Thái Nguyên City and Sông Công City.

The average temperatures in the hottest and the coldest months are 28.9&nbsp;°C in June and 15.2&nbsp;°C in January. The lowest recorded is 13.7&nbsp;°C. Total number of sunny hours in a year is ranges between  1,300 and 1,750, which is equally distributed for months in a year. The climate is divided into 4 distinct seasons: Spring - Summer - Autumn - Winter. The average rainfall per annum lies in the range of 2,000 to 2,500&nbsp;mm; it rains most in August and least in January. Generally speaking, Thái Nguyên's climate is favourable for developing agriculture and forestry.

===Soil structure===
The total land area is {{convert|3534.45|km2|mi2}} and can be divided into three classes. Mountainous land accounts for 48.4% area and is formed from the decaying of [[magma]], rocks and [[sedimentary rock]].  Hilly land accounts for 31.4% area and is made of condensed sand, clay and ancient [[alluvium|alluvia]]. Hill land in some places such as Đại Từ, Phú Lương is 120 to 200 metres high and more with a sloping gradient of 5° to 20° and is an ideal place for planting industrial crops and [[Perennial plant|perennial]] fruit trees. Field land accounts 12.4%, a part of which is scattered along streams and can be easily exposed to severe meteorological conditions (such as sudden floods and droughts) and is difficult to harvest. Of the total land area, 2,207.89&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (65.22% of natural area) are used and 1,096.69&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (30.78% of natural area) are unused. Of unused land area, only 17.14&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> area is cultivable; bare land and deserted hills occupy 412.5&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. A major problem faced by Thái Nguyên province is to recover deserted areas.

==Economy and development==
Farming, aquaculture and industries are some of the important economic activities of the province. In 2008, as against the national figure of 7,592 cooperatives of Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery cooperatives, there are only 83 agriculture cooperatives in the province.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gso.gov.vn/default_en.aspx?tabid=469&idmid=3&ItemID=8895 |title=Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery: Number of cooperatives by province |access-date=2010-06-23 |publisher=Population and Employment: General Statistics Office of the Government of Vietnam |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113143803/http://www.gso.gov.vn/default_en.aspx?tabid=469&idmid=3&ItemID=8895 |archive-date=2009-11-13 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gso.gov.vn/default_en.aspx?tabid=469&idmid=3&ItemID=8894 |title=Number of cooperatives in 2008 by kind of activity and by province: Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery |access-date=2010-06-23 |publisher=Population and Employment: General Statistics Office of the Government of Vietnam |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113143601/http://www.gso.gov.vn/default_en.aspx?tabid=469&idmid=3&ItemID=8894 |archive-date=2009-11-13 }}</ref> There were 638 farms as against the national number of 120,699 in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gso.gov.vn/default_en.aspx?tabid=469&idmid=3&ItemID=8893 |title=Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery: Number of farms by province |access-date=2010-06-23 |publisher=Population and Employment:General Statistics Office of the Government of Vietnam |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113143547/http://www.gso.gov.vn/default_en.aspx?tabid=469&idmid=3&ItemID=8893 |archive-date=2009-11-13 }}</ref> The output value of agriculture produce at constant 1994 prices in the province was 1667.1 billion [[Vietnamese đồng|đồngs]] against the national value of 156681.9 billion đồngs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gso.gov.vn/default_en.aspx?tabid=469&idmid=3&ItemID=8889 |title=Agriculture, Forestry and Fishery :Output value of agriculture at constant 1994 prices |access-date=2010-06-23 |publisher=Population and Employment :General Statistics Office of the Government of Vietnam |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113143648/http://www.gso.gov.vn/default_en.aspx?tabid=469&idmid=3&ItemID=8889 |archive-date=2009-11-13 }}</ref>

The economy of the province is largely dictated by its capital city, Thái Nguyên, which is the fastest growing city of North Vietnam. The city is the gateway to [[Northwest (Vietnam)|northwest Vietnam]]. It is famous for its tree plantations. Its historical importance is due to the fact that Ho Chi Minh resided here in the [[Phu Dinh]] village of Dinh Hoa district when he planned ''Dien Bien Phu''. Before he moved to Hanoi, he came here from [[Tan Trao]] and declared independence. The city is also the centre of heavy industries of northern Vietnam. Thái Nguyên Iron and Steel Company ([[TISCO (Vietnam)|TISCO]]), which is located in Thái Nguyên city, is one of Vietnam's top 20 state-owned companies, and has made a sizable contribution to Vietnam's economy. The city is located on the bank of the [[Cầu River]] has a geographical area of approximately {{convert|17707|ha|acre}} and its population was 228,064 in 2005.

Samsung Electronics has their largest mobile phone factory in Thai Nguyen, employing over 60,000 people.[9] The factory has operated since 2014 and has an area of 100 ha.[10]

Thai Nguyen's export experienced a ten-fold increase to over US$23 billion in the 2013 – 2017 period. The province hosted nearly 7,200 businesses in 2020 with a combined capital value approaching US$5.4 billion.

As per Thai Nguyen's Department of Industry and Trade, for the first three quarters of 2020, the province's total industrial gross output exceeded US$27 billion, while the domestic economic sector achieved US$1.8 billion. Both of these were over 70 percent of the province's annual target. In the same period, foreign-invested enterprises generated close to US$23 billion, an increase of 2.3 percent over the previous year.

Among the province's industries, the electronics and high-tech domains delivered the best results. Their production increased by over 16 percent year-on-year for laptops, while earphone manufacturing grew by five percent.

The socioeconomics of Thai Nguyen has seen remarkable development. In the first three quarters of 2020, industry and construction covered nearly 60 percent of the province's economy while the services sector accounted for roughly one-third of the economy. In the same period, the province's GDP per capita reached US$4,260, while industrial production rose by over 16 percent, and local exports grew by over 13 percent.

Thai Nguyen has also experienced significant development in infrastructure and labor productivity. Recently, the province experienced an influx of sustainable ventures. In 2020, over ten investment certificates were granted to eco-friendly and energy-efficient ventures, with a combined worth of over US$30 million.

Over the past decade, Thai Nguyen attracted a considerable amount of foreign direct investment. Samsung's establishment of a mobile phone manufacturing complex in the province has dramatically boosted Thai Nguyen's FDI. The province achieved over 13 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) during the 2015–2020 period.

As per the Foreign Investment Agency (FIA), in August 2020, the province hosted over 172 foreign-invested projects. Together these enterprises added over US$8 billion in registered capital. This made Thai Nguyen among the country's top 10 localities in terms of international investment inflow.

In a bid to attract investors with industrial expertise, the province is concentrating on improving the local investment climate. Thai Nguyen has prioritized timely issuance of government policies, guidance, and support for financiers. Local authorities have also shown a keen interest in high technology industries and ancillaries.

In December 2020, Hong Kong's electronic firm, DBG Technology, was awarded an investment certificate by provincial authorities to set up a US$80 million manufacturing facility. This facility will manufacture laptops, cameras, phones, audio equipment, and home appliances. It is expected to generate a revenue of US$110 million annually, employing over 10,000 workers.

In the same month, China's Trina Solar received Thai Nguyen's approval to produce photovoltaic cells and solar power. With investment exceeding US$200 million, this facility has a planned capacity of over 250 million products a year. The plant is expected to begin operations from June 2021 and add over 1,800 jobs.

In November 2020, South Korean touchscreen manufacturer Samju Vina, injected capital to add a second plant in Thai Nguyen. This funding should raise its regional production per month from 20 million to 35 million units.

For enhancing its overall competitiveness, Thai Nguyen is actively encouraging the private and high-tech sectors to develop production clusters and connect value chains.

===Industrial zones===

Thai Nguyen's six industrial parks are spread over 1400 hectares of land area, five of which have already received funding. The province is promoting infrastructure investment in its 105-hectare Quyet Thang Hi-Tech Industrial Park that is situated eight kilometers away from Thai Nguyen city center.

The province's plans include 35 industrial clusters with an area of nearly 1,260 hectares. The province has called for investment in 11 of these clusters, which have a planned area of over 280 hectares. The province aims to attract investment in secondary industries that complement the Samsung group and increase its localization degree.

Specifically, industries in electronics, electric, software, high precision mechanical, and textile are favored. The investment locations promoted by Thai Nguyen include the industrial zones in Yen Binh, Diem Thuy, and Song Cong. These, along with the province-wide industrial clusters, are equipped with appropriate technical infrastructure to establish enterprises.

To raise funds, Thai Nguyen provincial authorities encouraged investors to lease land for 50 years for a one lump sum payment. Consequently, these efforts led to the collection of US$65 million to develop industrial parks.

The Diem Thuy Industrial Park is one such example and features 77 projects with combined investment exceeding US$1.1 billion. This park's projects are modern, eco-friendly, and employ over 20,000 locals.

===Irrigation and hydroelectric power===
[[Núi Cốc reservoir]] is 25&nbsp;km west of Thái Nguyên city. It covers an area of {{convert|2500|ha|acre}} with {{convert|23|m|ft}} deep waters that can store 175 million cubic metres. The lake waters feeds an irrigation canal and a small [[hydroelectric power]] station with three units of 630 KW capacity each, for a total output of about 2 GWh. The irrigation system was built in 1977. However, the power plant construction on the irrigation canal was started in Jan 2008 and the plant commissioned in Jan 2010. A 22 kV transmission line carries the power to a nearby grid.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.industcards.com/hydro-vietnam.htm|title=Hydroelectric Power Plants in Vietnam|work=Ho Nui Coc|access-date=2010-06-25|publisher=Powerplants Around the World|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090719031413/http://www.industcards.com/hydro%2Dvietnam.htm|archive-date=2009-07-19}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cdm.unfccc.int/UserManagement/FileStorage/LQ6KJNW809SBPOVEI314M5F7AXCTZ2|title=Project Design Document Form (CDM-SSC-PDD)|work=Hui Noc Hydroelectric Project, Vietnam|page=3|access-date=2010-06-25|publisher=CDM Executive Board}}</ref>

===Transport===
Two [[List of railway lines in Vietnam|railway lines]] serve Thái Nguyên Province, and particularly the city of [[Thái Nguyên]]. The first line connects [[Hanoi Railway Station]] to [[Quán Triều Railway Station]] (Quán Triều Ward), and the second connects [[Lưu Xá Railway Station]] (Phú Xá Ward) to [[Hạ Long Railway Station]], [[Hạ Long]], via a railway junction at [[Kép]] in [[Bắc Giang province]]. Both lines were built after the [[First Indochina War]]; unlike most railway lines in Vietnam, which were established in [[metre gauge]], the {{convert|163|km|mi|abbr=on}} Luu Xa–Hạ Long line was built at [[standard gauge]], and the {{convert|75|km|mi|abbr=on}} Hanoi–Quán Triều line was built at [[dual gauge|mixed gauge]].

==Attractions==
There are several tourist attractions in the province. Some of the ones outside the capital city are listed below.

;Núi Cốc Lake
[[Núi Cốc Lake]] is the most popular attraction. Tour boats circle the lake, recounting local legends and visiting some of the 89 islands within it.
