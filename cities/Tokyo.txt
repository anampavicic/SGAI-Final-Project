The [[Greater Tokyo Area]], which includes Tokyo and parts of six neighboring [[Prefectures of Japan|prefectures]], is the most-populous metropolitan area in the world, with 41 million residents {{As of|2024|lc=y}}.

Located at the head of [[Tokyo Bay]], Tokyo is part of the [[Kantō region]] on the central coast of [[Honshu]], Japan's largest island. Tokyo serves as Japan's economic center and the seat of both the [[Government of Japan|Japanese government]] and the [[Emperor of Japan]]. The [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] administers Tokyo's central [[Special wards of Tokyo|23 special wards]] (which formerly made up [[Tokyo City]]), various commuter towns and suburbs in [[Western Tokyo|its western area]], and two outlying island chains known as the [[Tokyo Islands]]. Despite most of the world recognizing Tokyo as a city, since 1943 its governing structure has been more akin to a prefecture, with an accompanying [[Governor of Tokyo|Governor]] and [[Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly|Assembly]] taking precedence over the smaller municipal governments which make up the metropolis. Notable special wards in Tokyo include [[Chiyoda, Tokyo|Chiyoda]], the site of the [[National Diet Building]] and the [[Tokyo Imperial Palace]]; [[Shinjuku]], the city's administrative center; and [[Shibuya]], a commercial, cultural, and business hub in the city.

Before the 17th century, Tokyo, then known as [[Edo (Tokyo)|Edo]], was mainly a fishing village. It gained political prominence in 1603 when it became the seat of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. By the mid-18th century, Edo was among the world's largest cities, with over a million residents. Following the [[Meiji Restoration]] in 1868, the imperial capital in [[Kyoto]] was moved to Edo, and the city was renamed Tokyo ({{Literal translation|[[Capital of Japan|Eastern Capital]]}}). In 1923, Tokyo was damaged substantially by the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]], and the city was later badly damaged by [[Bombing of Tokyo|allied bombing raids]] during [[World War II]]. Beginning in the late 1940s, Tokyo underwent rapid reconstruction and expansion that contributed to the era's so-called [[Japanese economic miracle]] in which [[Economy of Japan|Japan's economy]] propelled to the [[List of countries by past and projected GDP (nominal)|second-largest in the world at the time]] behind [[Economy of the United States|that of the United States]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=External Economic Relations: From Recovery to Prosperity to Making a Positive Contribution |url=https://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/other/bluebook/1985/1985-3-1.htm#:~:text=After%20a%20brief%20recession%20in,in%20the%20world%20in%201968. |access-date=July 15, 2023 |website=www.mofa.go.jp}}</ref> {{As of|2023}}, the city is home to 29 of the world's 500 largest companies, as listed in the annual [[Fortune Global 500|''Fortune'' Global 500]]; the second-highest number of any city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Major European capital slips out of Fortune Global 500's top 5 cities for the first time in 5 years |url=https://fortune.com/2023/08/03/fortune-global-500-top-5-cities/ |access-date=August 8, 2023 |website=Fortune |language=en |archive-date=August 9, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230809044351/https://fortune.com/2023/08/03/fortune-global-500-top-5-cities/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 20th and 21st centuries, Tokyo became the first city in Asia to host the [[Summer Olympics]] and [[Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]] in 1964, and again in 2021, and it also hosted three [[G7]] summits in 1979, 1986, and 1993.

Tokyo was originally a village called [[Edo (Tokyo)|Edo]], part of the old [[Musashi Province]]. Edo was first fortified by the Edo clan in the late twelfth century. In 1457, [[Ōta Dōkan]] built [[Edo Castle]] to defend the region from the [[Chiba clan]]. After Dōkan was assassinated in 1486, the castle and the area came to be possessed by several feudal lords. In 1590, [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] was granted the [[Kantō region]] by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] and moved there from his ancestral land of [[Mikawa Province]]. He greatly expanded the castle, which was said to have been abandoned and in tatters when he moved there, and ruled the region from there. When he became ''[[Shogun|shōgun]]'', the de facto ruler of the country, in 1603, the whole country came to be ruled from Edo. While the [[Tokugawa shogunate]] ruled the country in practice, the [[Imperial House of Japan]] was still the de jure ruler, and the title of shōgun was granted by the Emperor as a formality. The Imperial House was based in [[Kyoto]] from 794 to 1868, so Edo was still not the capital of Japan.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Making of Urban Japan: Cities and Planning from Edo to the Twenty-First Century |last=Sorensen |first=Andre |year=2004 |page=16 }}</ref>
During the [[Edo period]], the city enjoyed a prolonged period of peace known as the ''Pax Tokugawa'', and in the presence of such peace, the shogunate adopted a stringent policy of seclusion, which helped to perpetuate the lack of any serious military threat to the city.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History |last=Naitō |first=Akira |year=2003 |pages=33, 55 }}</ref> The absence of war-inflicted devastation allowed Edo to devote the majority of its resources to rebuilding in the wake of the consistent fires, [[earthquakes in Japan|earthquakes]], and other devastating natural disasters that plagued the city. Edo grew into one of the largest cities in the world with a population reaching one million by the 18th century.<ref>{{cite book |last=McClain, James |first=James |title=Edo and Paris: Urban Life and the State in the Early Modern Era |year=1994 |page=13 |display-authors=etal}}</ref>

This prolonged period of seclusion however came to an end with the arrival of American Commodore [[Matthew C. Perry]] in 1853. Commodore Perry forced the opening of the ports of [[Shimoda, Shizuoka|Shimoda]] and [[Hakodate]], leading to an increase in the demand for new foreign goods and subsequently a severe rise in inflation.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History|last=Naitō |first=Akira |year=2003 |pages=182–183 }}</ref> Social unrest mounted in the wake of these higher prices and culminated in widespread rebellions and demonstrations, especially in the form of the "smashing" of rice establishments.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History |last=Naitō |first=Akira |year=2003 |page=186 }}</ref> Meanwhile, supporters of the Emperor leveraged the disruption caused by widespread rebellious demonstrations to further consolidate power, which resulted in the overthrow of the last Tokugawa shōgun, [[Tokugawa Yoshinobu|Yoshinobu]], in 1867.<ref>{{cite book |title=Edo, the City That Became Tokyo: An Illustrated History |last=Naitō |first=Akira |year=2003 |page=188 }}</ref> After 265 years, the ''Pax Tokugawa'' came to an end. In May 1868, Edo castle was handed to the Emperor-supporting forces after negotiation (the [[Fall of Edo]]). Some forces loyal to the shogunate kept fighting, but with their loss in the [[Battle of Ueno]] on 4 July 1868, the entire city came under the control of the [[Government of Meiji Japan|new government]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Japan - The fall of the Tokugawa {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan/The-fall-of-the-Tokugawa |access-date=2024-05-17 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en |archive-date=May 17, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240517154848/https://www.britannica.com/place/Japan/The-fall-of-the-Tokugawa |url-status=live }}</ref>

After the overthrow of the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], for the first time in a few centuries, the Emperor ceased to be a mere figurehead and became both the de facto and de jure ruler of the country. [[Maejima Hisoka|Hisoka Maejima]] advocated for the relocation of the capital functions to Tokyo, recognizing the advantages of the existing infrastructure and the vastness of the [[Kantō Plain|Kanto Plain]] compared to the relatively small [[Kyoto Prefecture|Kyoto basin]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Who Is Hisoka Maejima?

Although Tokyo recovered robustly from the earthquake and new cultural and liberal political movements, such as [[Taishō Democracy]], spread, the 1930s saw an economic downturn caused by the [[Great Depression]] and major political turmoil. Two attempted military ''coups d'état'' happened in Tokyo, the [[May 15 incident]] in 1932 and the [[February 26 incident]] in 1936. This turmoil eventually allowed the military wings of the government to take control of the country, leading to Japan joining the [[World War II|Second World War]] as an [[Axis powers|Axis power]]. Due to the country's political isolation on the international stage caused by its [[Second Sino-Japanese War|military aggression in China]] and the increasingly unstable geopolitical situations in Europe, Тоkуо had to give up hosting the [[1940 Summer Olympics]] in 1938.<ref>Organizing Committee of the XIIth Olympiad.

In 1943, [[Tokyo City]] merged with [[Tokyo Prefecture (1868–1943)|Tokyo Prefecture]] to form the '''Tokyo Metropolis''' (東京都, ''Tōkyō-to''). This reorganization aimed to create a more centralized and efficient administrative structure to better manage resources, urban planning, and civil defence during wartime.<ref>{{Cite web |title=東京都はいつからあるの？｜公文書に見る戦時と戦後 －統治機構の変転－ |url=https://www.jacar.go.jp/glossary/tochikiko-henten/qa/qa29.html |access-date=2024-05-24 |website=www.jacar.go.jp}}</ref> The Tokyo Metropolitan Government thus became responsible for both prefectural and city functions while administering cities, towns, and villages in the suburban and rural areas.
Although Japan enjoyed significant success in the initial stages of the war and rapidly expanded its sphere of influence, the [[Doolittle Raid]] on 18 April 1942, marked the first direct foreign attack on Tokyo.

After the war, Tokyo became the base from which the [[Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers|Allied Occupational Forces]], under [[Douglas MacArthur]], an American general, administered Japan for six years. The original rebuilding plan of Tokyo was based on a plan modelled after the [[Metropolitan Green Belt|Metropolitan Green Belt of London]], devised in the 1930s but canceled due to the war.<ref name=":1">[https://www.toshiseibi.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/keikaku_chousa_singikai/pdf/tokyotoshizukuri/2_08.pdf Rebuilding of the city after the war] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240525070808/https://www.toshiseibi.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/keikaku_chousa_singikai/pdf/tokyotoshizukuri/2_08.pdf |date=May 25, 2024 }} (in Japanese) Tokyo Metropolitan Government, 2019</ref> However, due to the monetary contraction policy known as the [[Dodge Line]], named after [[Joseph Dodge]], the neoliberal economic advisor to MacArthur, the plan had to be reduced to a minimal one focusing on transport and other infrastructure. In 1947, the 35 pre-war special wards were reorganized into the [[Special wards of Tokyo|current 23 wards]]. Tokyo did not experience fast economic growth until around 1950, when heavy industry output returned to pre-war levels.<ref>Andre Sorensen.

From the 1950s onwards, Tokyo's [[Tokyo subway|Metro]] and [[Transport in Greater Tokyo#Rail|railway]] network saw significant expansion, culminating in the launch of the world's first dedicated high-speed railway line, the [[Shinkansen]], between Tokyo and Osaka in 1964.

The {{Nihongo|[[Special wards of Tokyo|23 special wards]]|特別区|tokubetsu-ku}}, which until 1943 constituted the [[Tokyo City|city of Tokyo]], are self-governing [[Municipalities of Japan|municipalities]], each having a mayor, a council, and the status of a city.

In addition to these 23 special wards, Tokyo also includes 26 more cities ({{linktext|lang=ja|市}} ''-shi''), five towns ({{linktext|lang=ja|町}} ''-chō'' or ''machi''), and eight villages ({{linktext|lang=ja|村}} ''-son'' or ''-mura''), each of which has a local government. The [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government]] administers the whole metropolis including the 23 special wards and the cities and towns that constitute the prefecture. It is headed by a publicly elected governor and metropolitan assembly. Its [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building|headquarters]] is in [[Shinjuku, Tokyo|Shinjuku]] Ward.

The governor of Tokyo is elected every four years. The incumbent governor, [[Yuriko Koike]], was elected in 2016, following the resignation of her predecessor, [[Yōichi Masuzoe|Yoichi Masuzoe]]. She was re-elected in 2020 and in 2024. The legislature of the Metropolis is called the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly|Metropolitan Assembly]], and it has one house with 127 seats.

Since the completion of the [[Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan#Process|Great Mergers of Heisei]] in 2001, Tokyo consists of 62 [[Municipalities of Japan|municipalities]]: 23 [[Special wards of Tokyo|special wards]], 26 [[Cities of Japan|cities]], 5 [[Towns of Japan|towns]] and 8 [[Villages of Japan|villages]]. All municipalities in Japan have a directly elected mayor and a directly elected assembly, each elected on independent four-year cycles. The 23 Special Wards cover the area that had been [[Tokyo City]] until 1943, 30 other municipalities are located in the [[Tama area]], and the remeining 9 are on Tokyo's outlying islands.
* The {{Nihongo|[[Special wards of Tokyo|special wards]]|特別区|tokubetsu-ku}} of Tokyo comprise the area formerly incorporated as [[Tokyo City]]. Each special ward has used the word "city" in their official English name in recent times (e.g. Chiyoda City), but their status is more akin to boroughs in London or New York. Certain municipal functions, such as waterworks, sewerage, and fire-fighting, are handled by the Tokyo Metropolitan Government rather than each ward. To pay for the added administrative costs, the Metropolitan Government collects municipal taxes, which would usually be levied by each ward.<ref>

* To the west of the special wards, Tokyo Metropolis consists of cities, towns, and villages that enjoy the same legal status as those elsewhere in Japan. While serving as "[[Bedroom community|bed towns]]" for those working in central Tokyo, some of them also have a local commercial and industrial base, such as [[Tachikawa]]. Collectively, these are often known as the Tama area or [[Western Tokyo]]. The far west of the Tama area is occupied by the district (''gun'') of [[Nishitama District, Tokyo|Nishi-Tama]]. Much of this area is mountainous and unsuitable for urbanization. The highest mountain in Tokyo, [[Mount Kumotori]], is {{convert|2017|m|ft|abbr=on}} high; other mountains in Tokyo include Takanosu ({{convert|1737|m|ft|abbr=on}}), Odake ({{convert|1266|m|ft|abbr=on}}), and [[Mount Mitake (Tokyo)|Mitake]] ({{convert|929|m|ft|abbr=on}}). [[Lake Okutama]], on the [[Tama River]] near [[Yamanashi Prefecture]], is Tokyo's largest lake and serves as the primary reservoir for Tokyo's water supply. The district is composed of three towns ([[Hinode, Tokyo|Hinode]], [[Mizuho, Tokyo|Mizuho]] and [[Okutama, Tokyo|Okutama]]) and one village ([[Hinohara, Tokyo|Hinohara]]). The Tokyo Metropolitan Government has designated Hachiōji, Tachikawa, Machida, Ōme and Tama New Town as regional centers of the Tama area.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toshiseibi.metro.tokyo.jp/plan/pe-011.htm|title=Development of the Metropolitan Center, Subcenters and New Base|access-date=October 14, 2007|publisher=Bureau of Urban Development, Tokyo Metropolitan Government|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071023073159/http://www.toshiseibi.metro.tokyo.jp/plan/pe-011.htm|archive-date=October 23, 2007|url-status=live}}</ref>

Because of the islands' distance from the administrative headquarters of the Tokyo Metropolitan Government in Shinjuku, local subprefectural branch offices administer them. The [[Izu Islands]] are a group of volcanic islands and form part of the [[Fuji-Hakone-Izu National Park]]. The islands in order from closest to Tokyo are [[Izu Ōshima]], [[Toshima Island|Toshima]], [[Nii-jima]], [[Shikine-jima]], [[Kōzu-shima]], [[Miyake-jima]], [[Mikurajima]], [[Hachijō-jima]], and [[Aogashima]]. The Izu Islands are grouped into three subprefectures. Izu Ōshima and Hachijojima are towns. The remaining islands are six villages, with Niijima and Shikinejima forming [[Niijima, Tokyo|one village]]. The [[Bonin Islands|Ogasawara Islands]] include, from north to south, [[Chichi-jima]], [[Nishinoshima (Ogasawara)|Nishinoshima]], [[Haha-jima]], [[North Iwo Jima|Kita Iwo Jima]], [[Iwo Jima]], and [[Minami Iwo Jima]].

== Geography ==
The mainland portion of Tokyo lies northwest of [[Tokyo Bay]] and measures about {{convert|90|km|abbr=on}} east to west and {{convert|25|km|abbr=on}} north to south. The average elevation in Tokyo is {{convert|40|m|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Population of Tokyo, Japan |url=http://population.mongabay.com/population/japan/1850147/tokyo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121222042/http://population.mongabay.com/population/japan/1850147/tokyo |archive-date=January 21, 2012 |access-date=February 10, 2012 |website=Mongabay}}</ref> [[Chiba Prefecture]] borders it to the east, [[Yamanashi Prefecture|Yamanashi]] to the west, [[Kanagawa Prefecture|Kanagawa]] to the south, and [[Saitama Prefecture|Saitama]] to the north. Mainland Tokyo is further subdivided into the special wards (occupying the eastern half) and the Tama area ({{Nihongo2|多摩地域}}) stretching westwards. Tokyo has a [[latitude]] of 35.65 (near the [[36th parallel north]]), which makes it more southern than [[Rome]] (41.90), [[Madrid]] (40.41), [[New York City]] (40.71) and [[Beijing]] (39.91).<ref>{{Cite web |date=September 2020 |title=Tokyo, Japan Geographic Information |url=http://www.latlong.net/place/tokyo-japan-8040.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170914042600/http://www.latlong.net/place/tokyo-japan-8040.html |archive-date=September 14, 2017 |access-date=September 16, 2020 |website=Latlong.net}}</ref>

Within the administrative boundaries of Tokyo Metropolis are two island chains in the Pacific Ocean directly south: the [[Izu Islands]], and the [[Ogasawara Islands]], which stretch more than {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} away from the mainland. Because of these islands and the mountainous regions to the west, Tokyo's overall population density figures far under-represent the real figures for the urban and suburban regions of Tokyo.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 2015 |title=Population of Tokyo – Tokyo Metropolitan Government |url=https://www.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/ENGLISH/ABOUT/HISTORY/history03.htm#:~:text=With%20a%20population%20density%20of,average%201.94%20persons%20per%20household. |access-date=September 7, 2020 |website=www.metro.tokyo.lg.jp |archive-date=March 20, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320031750/https://www.metro.tokyo.lg.jp/ENGLISH/ABOUT/HISTORY/history03.htm#:~:text=With%20a%20population%20density%20of,average%201.94%20persons%20per%20household. |url-status=live }}</ref>

The climates of Tokyo's offshore territories vary significantly from those of the city. The climate of [[Chichijima]] in [[Ogasawara, Tokyo|Ogasawara village]] is on the boundary between the [[tropical savanna climate]] (Köppen classification: ''Aw'') and the [[tropical rainforest climate]] (Köppen classification: ''Af''). It is approximately {{cvt|1,000.|km}} south of the [[Greater Tokyo Area]], resulting in much different climatic conditions.

Tokyo's easternmost territory, the island of [[Minamitorishima]] in [[Ogasawara, Tokyo|Ogasawara village]], is in the tropical savanna climate zone (Köppen classification: ''Aw''). Tokyo's Izu and Ogasawara islands are affected by an average of 5.4 typhoons a year, compared to 3.1 in mainland Kantō.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.data.jma.go.jp/fcd/yoho/typhoon/statistics/average/average.html |script-title=ja:気象統計情報 / 天気予報・台風 / 過去の台風資料 / 台風の統計資料 / 台風の平年値 |publisher=[[Japan Meteorological Agency]] |access-date=August 8, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607022806/http://www.data.jma.go.jp/fcd/yoho/typhoon/statistics/average/average.html |archive-date=June 7, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Natural disasters ===

==== Earthquakes ====
[[File:Yurakucho after Great Kanto earthquake.JPG|right|thumb|The [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kanto Earthquake]] in 1923 killed more than 100,000 citizens in Tokyo.]]
Tokyo is near the [[Boso Triple Junction|boundary of three plates]], making it an extremely active region for smaller quakes and [[Slow earthquake|slippage]] which frequently affect the urban area with swaying as if in a boat, although epicenters within mainland Tokyo (excluding Tokyo's {{cvt|2,000.|km}}–long island jurisdiction) are quite rare. It is not uncommon in the metro area to have hundreds of these minor quakes (magnitudes 4–6) that can be felt in a single year, something local residents merely brush off but can be a source of anxiety not only for foreign visitors but for Japanese from elsewhere as well. They rarely cause much damage (sometimes a few injuries) as they are either too small or far away as quakes tend to dance around the region. Particularly active are offshore regions and to a lesser extent [[Chiba Prefecture|Chiba]] and [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Matsu'ura |first=Ritsuko S. |date=January 28, 2017 |title=A short history of Japanese historical seismology: past and the present |journal=Geoscience Letters |volume=4 |issue=1 |page=3 |bibcode=2017GSL.....4....3M |doi=10.1186/s40562-017-0069-4 |via=BioMed Central |doi-access=free}}</ref>

Tokyo has been hit by powerful [[megathrust]] earthquakes in 1703, 1782, 1812, 1855, 1923, and much more indirectly (with some [[soil liquefaction|liquefaction]] in landfill zones) in [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|2011]];<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Grunewald |first1=Elliot D. |last2=Stein |first2=Ross S. |year=2006 |title=A New 1649–1884 Catalog of Destructive Earthquakes near Tokyo and Implications for the Long-term Seismic Process |journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth |volume=111 |issue=B12 |pages=B12306 |bibcode=2006JGRB..11112306G |doi=10.1029/2005JB004059 |doi-access=free}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A new probabilistic seismic hazard assessment for greater Tokyo |url=http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/reports/reprints/Stein_PRSLA_364.pdf |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071025030342/http://walrus.wr.usgs.gov/reports/reprints/Stein_PRSLA_364.pdf |archive-date=October 25, 2007 |access-date=October 14, 2007 |website=U.S. Geological Survey}}</ref> the frequency of direct and large quakes is a relative rarity.

The [[Meiji era]] saw a rapid modernization in architectural styles as well; until the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake|Great Kanto Earthquake]] in 1923 exposed their weakness to seimic shocks, grand brick buildings were constantly built across the city. [[Tokyo Station]] (1914), the [[Old Ministry of Justice Building|Ministry of Justice building]] (1895), the [[International Library of Children's Literature]] (1906) and [[Mitsubishi Ichigokan Museum, Tokyo|Mistubishi building one]] (1894, rebuilt in 2010) are some of the few brick survivors from this period. It was regarded as fashionable by some members of the [[Kazoku|Japanese aristocracy]] to build their Tokyo residences in grand and modern styles, and some of these buildings still exist, although most are in private hands and open to the public on limited occasions. Aristocratic residences today open to the public include the [[Komaba Park|Marquess Maeda residence]] in [[Komaba]], the [[Kyū-Iwasaki-tei Garden|Baron Iwasaki residence]] in Ikenohata and the [[Kyū-Furukawa Gardens|Baron Furukawa residence]] in Nishigahara.

The 1930s saw the rise of styles that combined characteristics of both traditional Japanese and modern designs. [[Itō Chūta|Chuta Ito]] was a leading figure in this movement, and his extant works in Tokyo include [[Tsukiji Hongan-ji]] (1934). The [[Imperial Crown Style]], which often features Japanese-style roofs on top of elevated concrete structures, was adopted for the [[Tokyo National Museum]] in Ueno and the Kudan Hall in [[Kudanminami]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=大介 |first=三村 |date=2022-06-13 |title=Was the Imperial Crown Style Really Nationalistic? |url=https://jbpress.ismedia.jp/articles/-/71480 |access-date=2024-06-22 |website=JBpress autograph |language=ja |archive-date=June 22, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240622053151/https://jbpress.ismedia.jp/articles/-/71480 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Since the 30-metre height restriction was lifted in the 1960s, Tokyo's most dense areas have been dominated by skyscrapers. As of May 2024, there are at least 184 buildings exceeding 150 metres (492 feet) in Tokyo. Apart from these, [[Tokyo Tower]] (333m) and [[Tokyo Skytree|Tokyo Sky Tree]] (634m) feature high-elevation observation decks; the latter is the tallest tower in both Japan and the world, and the second tallest structure in the world after the [[Burj Khalifa]] in [[Dubai]].<ref name="skytree" /> With a scheduled completion date in 2027, [[Torch Tower (Japan)|Torch Tower]] (385m) will overtake [[Azabudai Hills|Azabudai Hills Mori JP Tower]] (325.2m) as the tallest building in Tokyo.

[[Kenzō Tange|Kenzo Tange]] designed notable contemporary buildings in Tokyo, including [[Yoyogi National Gymnasium]] (1964), [[St. Mary's Cathedral, Tokyo|St. Mary's Cathedral]] (1967), and the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Government Building]] (1991). [[Kisho Kurokawa]] was also active in the city, and his works there include the [[The National Art Center, Tokyo|National Art Center]] (2005) and the [[Nakagin Capsule Tower]] (1972). Other notable contemporary buildings in Tokyo include the [[Tokyo Dome]], [[Mode Gakuen Cocoon Tower]], [[Roppongi Hills]], [[Tokyo International Forum]], and [[Asahi Beer Hall]].

=== Dialects ===
{{See also|Tokyo dialect}}
[[Japanese language|Japanese]] is the primary language spoken throughout the metropolis, though regional and socio-economic differences can be heard. Traditionally, dialects in Tokyo are classified into two groups: the Yamanote dialect and the Shitamachi dialect. The former has traditionally been spoken in the upper- and upper-middle-class residential area of Yamanote, which includes [[Banchō|Bancho]], [[Kōjimachi|Kojimachi]], [[Koishikawa]], [[Kudankita|Kudan]], [[Yotsuya]], [[Azabu]], and [[Akasaka, Tokyo|Akasaka]]. During the [[Edo period]], these neighborhoods were occupied by ''[[Daimyo]]'' and other powerful [[samurai]] families, and the dialect evolved largely based on their way of speech. Standard Japanese pronunciation is largely based on this accent and spread across the country with the introduction of [[radio]]. The Shitamachi dialect, in contrast, has been associated with the ''[[Chōnin]]'' district of Shitamachi and retains many characteristics of the accents spoken there in the Edo era.<ref>Yoshifumi Tobita.

Tokyo's position as the country's cultural, political and economic hub has made its media industry the largest in Japan. A majority of national media companies are headquartered in Tokyo, as well as the Asian or Japanese branches of international media companies. The [[NHK]], the oldest and only nation-wide public broadcaster in the country, is headquartered in [[Shibuya]]. Other national broadcasters,<ref name=":5">{{Cite news |date=2011-10-07 |title=Japan media guide |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15217593 |access-date=2024-07-13 |work=BBC News |language=en-GB |archive-date=September 2, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200902042447/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-pacific-15217593 |url-status=live }}</ref> such as [[TBS Television (Japan)|TBS]], [[Nippon Television]], [[Fuji Television]], and [[TV Asahi]], are also based in Tokyo.

With 36% of its area covered by forest, Tokyo has extensive growths of [[cryptomeria]] and [[Chamaecyparis obtusa|Japanese cypress]], especially in the mountainous western communities of Akiruno, Ōme, Okutama, Hachiōji, Hinode, and Hinohara. Decreases in the price of timber, increases in the cost of production, and advancing old age among the forestry population have resulted in a decline in Tokyo's output. In addition, pollen, especially from cryptomeria, is a major [[Seasonal allergies|allergen]] for the nearby population centers. Tokyo Bay was once a major source of fish. Most of Tokyo's fish production comes from the outer islands, such as Izu Ōshima and Hachijō-Jima.

[[File:Tokyo-International-Airport Satellite.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Aerial view of [[Haneda Airport]]]]
The mainland portion of Tokyo is served by two international airports: [[Haneda Airport]] in [[Ōta, Tokyo|Ōta]] and [[Narita International Airport]] in neighboring [[Chiba Prefecture]]. Haneda has served as the primary airport for Tokyo since 1931. However, the Jet Age saw an exponential increase in flights, prompting the government to build a second airport. Narita was chosen as the site for this second airport in 1966, but local farmers and left-wing activists who sympathized with them protested vehemently for more than a decade (the [[Sanrizuka Struggle]]), delaying the new airport's opening until 1978. Almost all international flights were transferred to Narita Airport upon its completion, and Haneda became primarily a domestic airport.<ref>{{Cite web |date=27 September 2023 |title=45 years since the opening of Narita Airport and the fading memory of the Sanrizuka struggle {{!}} JBpress |url=https://jbpress.ismedia.jp/articles/-/77169 |access-date=2024-06-29 |website=JBpress（日本ビジネスプレス） |language=ja |archive-date=July 25, 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240725000941/https://jbpress.ismedia.jp/articles/-/77169 |url-status=live }}</ref>
