Naperville was founded in 1831 by [[Joseph Naper]]. The city was established by the banks of the DuPage River and was originally known as Naper's Settlement. By 1832, over 100 residents lived in Naper's Settlement. In 1839, after DuPage County was split from [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], Naperville became the county seat, which it remained until 1868. Beginning in the 1960s, Naperville experienced a significant population increase as a result of Chicago's urban sprawl.

Naperville is home to [[Moser Tower and Millennium Carillon]], one of the world's four largest carillons. It is also home to an extensive parks and forest preserve network, including [[Centennial Beach]]. The city has two school districts, [[Naperville Community Unit School District 203|203]] and [[Indian Prairie School District 204|204]]. Naperville's largest employer is [[Edward Hospital]] with 4,500 employees. Naperville has a [[Naperville station|train station]] served by [[Amtrak]] and [[Metra]].

==History==
[[File:Pine Craig (5978097719).jpg|thumb|right|The Martin-Mitchell Mansion, within the [[Naper Settlement]] outdoor museum, is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places listings in DuPage County, Illinois|National Register of Historic Places]]]]

Before any settlement, Naperville was home to Native American tribes. In 1641, the first European contact with Native Americans in Illinois was made with members of the [[Illinois Confederation|Iliniwek]] tribe. The Iliniwek was the predominant tribe throughout Illinois at the time. They were later forced off the land by the [[Potawatomi]] tribe. The Potawatomi inhabited Naperville when the first settlers arrived.<ref>{{cite web|date=2014-01-15|title=The Curious Curator – Before Naper|url=https://www.positivelynaperville.com/2014/01/15/curious-curator-naper/30190|access-date=2022-01-05|website=Positively Naperville|language=en-US|archive-date=April 9, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220409092759/https://www.positivelynaperville.com/2014/01/15/curious-curator-naper/30190|url-status=live}}</ref> There was a major Potawatomi village at the present site of downtown Naperville, reached from Chicago by a trail that became Ogden Avenue.

By 1832, over 100 settlers had arrived at Naper's Settlement. After the news of the [[Indian Creek massacre]] during the [[Black Hawk War]], these settlers were temporarily displaced to [[Fort Dearborn]] for protection from an anticipated attack by the [[Sauk people|Sauk]] tribe. Fort Payne was built at Naper's Settlement, the settlers returned and the attack never materialized. The Pre-Emption House was constructed in 1834, as the Settlement became a [[stagecoach]] stop on the road from Chicago to [[Galena, Illinois|Galena]]. The Pre-Emption House was the first hotel in DuPage county.<ref>{{cite web|title=Naperville's first builder|url=https://www.lib.niu.edu/2005/ih010805.html|access-date=2022-01-05|website=www.lib.niu.edu|archive-date=January 5, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220105084052/https://www.lib.niu.edu/2005/ih010805.html|url-status=live}}</ref> After DuPage County was split from Cook County in 1839, Naper's Settlement became the DuPage [[county seat]].<ref name=":1" /> In 1843, the Illinois General assembly passed an act to incorporate the Naperville Cemetery Association.<ref>{{Cite news |date=1843-03-24 |title=Naperville Cemetery Incorporated |pages=2 |work=Illinois State Register |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/96535675/naperville-cemetery-incorporated/ |access-date=2022-02-27 |archive-date=April 9, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220409092759/https://www.newspapers.com/clip/96535675/naperville-cemetery-incorporated/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In 1855, Sybil Dunbar came to Naperville as its first recorded black female resident; she died in 1868 and was buried in Naperville Cemetery.<ref name="dailyherald1">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150528/news/150528633/ |title=Naperville honors its first female black resident with grave marker |publisher=DailyHerald.com |date=May 28, 2015 |access-date=May 29, 2015 |archive-date=May 30, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530010454/http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20150528/news/150528633/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Naperville Public Library was founded when James Nichols, a Naperville resident, bequeathed $10,000 to the City Of Naperville, to establish a library after his passing. On September 22, 1898, the Nichols Library formally opened. Its collection comprised over 700 books. With the population of Naperville growing, the original location was running out of space. In 1983 a referendum was passed to build a new library, and the new Nichols Library opened on March 11, 1986. As the population increased, the need for a new branch was evident. Land was acquired, and the upper floor of the Naper Boulevard Library opened to the public on December 29, 1992. South Naperville still had a gap in the Library's coverage, so the 95th Street Library was opened on September 21, 2003.<ref>{{Cite web|title=History {{!}} Naperville Public Library|url=https://www.naperville-lib.org/about/history|access-date=2022-01-07|website=www.naperville-lib.org|archive-date=April 9, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220409092922/https://www.naperville-lib.org/about/history|url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Riverwalk ====
The Park District is responsible for the Naperville Riverwalk, construction of which began in 1981, marking the 150th anniversary of the first Joseph Naper's settlement. The Naperville Riverwalk is {{convert|1.75|mi|km}} miles long and runs along the West Branch of the DuPage River. It consists of brick paths, fountains, and covered bridges. In addition, the Riverwalk features fountains, art pieces, and nearby resuraunts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.naperville.il.us/riverwalk.aspx|title=Official Site of the City of Naperville, IL|access-date=June 7, 2009|archive-date=March 29, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160329031051/http://www.naperville.il.us/riverwalk.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> The Naperville Riverwalk Commission has started a plan to expand the Riverwalk greatly, in the "Riverwalk 2031 Master Plan."
