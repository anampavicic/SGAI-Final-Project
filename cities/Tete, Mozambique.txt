'''Tete''' is the capital city of [[Tete Province]] in [[Mozambique]].  It is located on the [[Zambezi River]], and is the site of two of the four bridges crossing the river in Mozambique.  A [[Swahili people|Swahili]] trade center before the [[Portuguese East Africa|Portuguese colonial era]], Tete continues to dominate the west-central part of the country and region, and is the largest city on the Zambezi. In the local language, [[Nyungwe language|Nyungwe]], Tete (or Mitete) means "reed".

==History==
The region was an important [[Swahili people|Swahili]] trade center before the [[Portuguese East Africa|Portuguese colonial era]]. On the [[East Africa|east coast of Africa]] the Portuguese were drawn to Mozambique and the [[Zambezi river]] by news of a local ruler, the [[Munhumutapa]], who was said to have had fabulous wealth in gold. In their efforts to reach the Munhumutapa, the Portuguese established in 1531 two settlements far up the Zambezi &ndash; one of them, at Tete, some {{convert|260|mi|km|order=flip}} from the sea. The Munhumutapa Kingdom and gold mines remained autonomous and mostly isolated from the Portuguese. But in this region of east Africa &ndash; as in [[Portuguese Guinea]] and [[Portuguese West Africa|Angola]] in the west &ndash; Portuguese involvement became sufficiently strong to survive into the third quarter of the 20th century. Under Portuguese influence Tete had become a market centre for [[ivory]] and [[gold]] by the mid-17th century. Given a Portuguese town charter in 1761, it became a city of the Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Mozambique]] in 1959. After the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] in Portuguese Africa and the April 1974 [[Carnation Revolution|military coup]] in [[Lisbon]], the then Portuguese Overseas Province of Mozambique become an independent state. The newly independent [[People's Republic of Mozambique]], created in 1975 after the exodus of Mozambique's ethnic Portuguese, descended into [[Mozambican Civil War|civil war]] between 1977 and 1992.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

== Transportation ==
[[Chingozi Airport]] {{Airport codes|TET|FQTT}} on the northeastern side of the city has a 2.4&nbsp;km paved runway.  The one-kilometre-long [[Samora Machel Bridge]], finished in 1973 by the Portuguese and designed by [[Edgar Cardoso (engineer)|Edgar Cardoso]], is a vital link on the major highway linking not just the northern and southern parts of the country, but [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Malawi]] as well. A second bridge south of the city was opened in late 2014 to allow traffic to Zambia or Malawi to bypass the provincial capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201007070977.html |title=Mozambique: Concession for New Bridge Over the Zambez|access-date=2008-08-06}}</ref>  Tete's bridges, the rail [[Dona Ana Bridge]], and the [[Armando Emilio Guebuza Bridge]] at [[Caia, Mozambique|Caia]] are the only bridges across the lower Zambezi.
