==History==
The name Pointe-Noire ("Black Point") originated with [[Portuguese navigators]] who saw a block of black rocks on the headland in 1484. From then on, Pointe-Noire, called in Portuguese ''Ponta Negra'', became a maritime point of reference, and then a small fishing village starting in 1883, after the French signed a treaty with local people, the [[Kingdom of Loango|Loangos]].

In 1910, [[French Equatorial Africa]] (''Afrique équatoriale française'', AEF) was created, and French companies were allowed to exploit the [[Middle Congo]] (modern-day Congo Brazzaville). It soon became necessary to build a railroad that would connect [[Brazzaville]], the terminus of the river navigation on the [[Congo River]] and the [[Ubangui River]], with the Atlantic coast. As [[rapids]] make it impossible to navigate on the Congo River past Brazzaville, and the coastal railroad terminus site had to allow for the construction of a deep-sea port, authorities chose the site of Ponta Negra instead of [[Libreville]] as originally envisaged. In 1923, it was chosen to be the terminus of the [[Congo-Ocean Railway]] (CFCO).<ref>John Frank Clark, Samuel Decalo, ''Historical Dictionary of Republic of the Congo'', Scarecrow Press, USA, 2012, p. 365</ref>

Roberts (FFG 58) prepares to moor for a port visit at Pointe Noire, Republic of Congo as part of Africa Partnership Station (APS) West. While in port, Samuel.jpg|thumb|right|[[USS Samuel B. Roberts (FFG-58)|USS ''Samuel B. Roberts'']] visiting the Port of Pointe Noire]]
In 1927, drinking water became available in the city, which had about 3,000 inhabitants. The airport was built in 1932. In 1934, Governor [[Raphael Antonetti]] inaugurated the [[Congo-Ocean Railway]]. The first hospital was built in 1936. That same year, [[Bank of West Africa (BAO)]] opened its first branch in the city. In 1942, the [[Pointe-Noire Harbour]] welcomed its first ship, and made the city the AEF's [[seaport]].

In 1950, Pointe-Noire had 20,000 inhabitants, and became the capital of the [[Middle Congo]], while Brazzaville was the [[capital (political)|capital city]] of the AEF.  In 1957, the Middle-Congo became the Republic of Congo, although it was still not independent. Incidents which occurred during 1958 legislative elections led the leaders of the [[Democratic Union for the Defence of African Interests]] (''Union démocratique pour la défense des interets africains'', UDDIA) to transfer the capital to Brazzaville, since Pointe-Noire was under the influence of the political opposition.

Pointe-Noire continued growing, and was the most modern city in 1960, when Congo gained independence. Then, the oil discovery around 1980 re-attracted people and [[Elf Aquitaine|Elf-Aquitaine]] facilities. The population doubled by 1982, and reached 360,000 in 1994.

Civil wars in 1997 and 1999 caused an influx of refugees from the surrounding provinces ([[Lékoumou Department|Lékoumou]], [[Niari Region|Niari]], [[Bouenza]], [[Pool Region|Pool]]) towards Pointe-Noire, causing the population to climb to over 1 million inhabitants.

Recently [[Politics of the Republic of the Congo|the Government]] has proposed the development of a new bulk resource port to be constructed at [[Point Indienne]], {{convert|30|km}} to the north of the Port of Pointe-Noire. A meeting was held on 18 December 2012 with a collective of 10 Congo government ministries and invited mining companies to discuss future development opportunities.

==Economy==
[[File:Timber for export at the Port of Pointe-Noire, Republic of Congo.jpg|thumb|Timber for export at the Port of Pointe-Noire]]
Pointe-Noire is the essential centre of the oil industry of the [[Republic of Congo]], one of the main oil producers in [[Central Africa]]. Congolese [[oil]] has been largely exploited by the French company [[Elf Aquitaine]] since its discovery around 1980.

Pointe-Noire is also known for its [[fishing industry]], which is often at odds with the oil development.<ref>{{cite book|title=Reconsidering informality: perspectives from urban Africa|year=2004|publisher=Nordic Africa Institute, 2004|isbn=91-7106-518-0|pages=235|author=Tati, Gabriel|chapter=Sharing Public Space in Pointe-Noire, Congo-Brazzaville: Immigrant Fishermen and a Multinational Oil Company|editor=Hansen, Karen Tranberg}}</ref> Local waters are reportedly getting overfished.<ref>{{Cite web |title=In Pictures: The rise of shark fishing off the Congolese coast |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2021/11/22/in-pictures-sharks-and-artisanal-fishermen-struggle-to-survive |access-date=2023-07-05 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}</ref>

Formerly, Pointe-Noire was home to a [[potash]] exploitation which led to the construction of a [[wharf]], currently closed to the public.

==Education==
[[Lycée Français Charlemagne]], a French international school for primary and secondary school children, is in Pointe-Noire. It also hosts a British international school for children aged 0 to 18 years, called Connie's Academy.<ref>{{cite web |title=Connie's Academy |url=http://www.conniesacademy.co.uk/ |publisher=Connie's Academy |access-date=23 August 2023}}</ref>

The city is home to the École Supérieure de Technologie du Littoral (technology) the École supérieure de commerce et de gestion (Business), Institut UCAC-ICAM (Engineering) and the Centre d’éducation, de formation et d’apprentissage en mécanique auto (Automotive Engineering).<ref>News of Bolloré Africa Logistics, Partnering schools in Congo Brazzaville: Congo Terminal commits to sandwich course education schemes., Congo Brazzaville. 7 August 2014, http://www.bollore-africa-logistics.com/en/media/news/partenariats-entreprise-ecoles-congo-brazzaville.html</ref> The [[Higher Institute of Technology of Central Africa]] has a campus in the city.

== University establishments ==
As a result of the decentralisation policy put in place by the Congolese government, Pointe-Noire has seen the emergence of some young universities. The city has several private institutes and universities:

* The University of Loango,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Universite-Loango |url=https://universite-loango.com/ |access-date=2024-02-04 |website=universite-loango.com}}</ref> which offers programmes in law, [[management]] and [[commerce]]

* Ecole Superieure of Commerce and Industry of Congo<ref>{{Cite web |title=ESCIC |url=https://www.escic-cg.com/}}</ref> of Congo offers Bachelor's degree courses in partnership with Ecole SupdeV Paris

Pointe-Noire is home to [[Agostinho-Neto International Airport]] which as of August 2023 had direct flights to [[Port Bouet Airport|Abidjan]], [[Bole International Airport|Addis Ababa]], [[Maya-Maya Airport|Brazzaville]],  [[Cadjehoun Airport|Cotonou]], [[Douala International Airport|Douala]], [[Istanbul Airport|Istanbul]], [[Libreville International Airport|Libreville]], [[Quatro de Fevereiro Airport|Luanda]] and [[Charles de Gaulle Airport|Paris]]<ref>{{cite web |title=Pointe Noire routes and destinations |url=https://www.flightradar24.com/data/airports/pnr/routes |website=Flightradar24 |access-date=23 August 2023}}</ref> and was the second busiest airport in the country.

Pointe-Noire is also the terminus of the [[Congo-Ocean Railway]], the [[railway station]] being a notable building. {{As of|2014}} the railway was operating the [[La Gazelle train|''La Gazelle'']] train service every other day to [[Brazzaville]] and intermediate destinations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Republic of Congo travel |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/congo |access-date=2023-07-05 |website=Lonely Planet |language=en}}</ref>

Thanks to its rapid growth, the city now includes [[Tié-Tié Railway Station]] and [[Ngondji Railway Station]], the next railway stations after the Pointe Noire terminus.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

On 22 June 2010 a train departing from Pointe-Noire derailed resulting in the deaths of many passengers.<ref name="aljazeera">{{cite web|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2010/6/23/scores-dead-in-congo-train-crash|title=Scores dead in Congo train crash|access-date=23 August 2023}}</ref> The railway was built by the [[France|French]] between 1921 and 1934 during the French colonial rule in Congo.

Pointe-Noire has a taxi-bus [[Transport network|network]] that runs throughout the entire city.
