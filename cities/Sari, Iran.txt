Sari is the largest and most populous city of Mazandaran.

==History==

===Early history===
Excavations in the [[Huto and Kamarband Caves|Hutto cave]] present evidence for the existence of settlements around Sari as far back as the 70th millennium BCE.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.showcaves.com/english/ir/subterranea/Huto.html|title=Subterranea of Iran: Huto and Kamarband Cave|work=showcaves.com}}</ref>
The Muslim historian [[Hamdollah Mostowfi]] attributes the foundation of Sari to king [[Tahmuras|Tahmoures Divband]] of the [[Pishdadian Dynasty]]. [[Ferdowsi]] mentions the name of the city in [[Shahnameh]], at the time of [[Fereydun]] and [[Manuchehr]], when Manuchehr is returning to Fereydun's capital, '''Tamisheh''' in [[Mazandaran]], after the victory over [[Salm (son of Fereydun)|Salm]] and [[Tur (son of Fereydun)|Tur]]:<ref>{{cite web|title=Shahnameh/Book of Kings|author= Abu'L Ferdawsi|publisher=Jalal Khaleghi-Motlagh|url=http://rira.ir/rira/php/?page=view&mod=classicpoems&obj=poem&id=15367&lim=20&pageno=3|website=rira.ir}}</ref>

{{quotation|ز دریای گیلان (مازندران) چون ابر سیاه / دمادم به ساری رسید آن سپاه / چو آمد به نزدیک شاه آن سپاه / فریدون پذیره بیامد به راه }}

the city's name was also '''Zadracarta''' in 658 B.C to 225 A.D.

Coming from this and other similar evidence in the [[Shahnameh]], native people of Sari have a folklore that the city was populated when the blacksmith [[Kaveh the blacksmith|Kaveh]] (a native of the city) revolted against the tyranny of [[Zahhak|Zahak]]. After that success, [[Fereydun|Fereydun of Pishdadi]] (from Tamishan) feeling indebted to Kaveh, chose this city so as to live near him until his death. For this reason, when Touraj and Salam murdered [[Iraj]] (son of Fereydun), they buried him here.

Espahbod Tous-e Nouzar (great-grandson of Fereydun) systematically founded it to remain as family monument.<ref name="CHN">{{cite web|title=Attractions - Mazandaran|publisher=Iran’s Cultural Heritage News Agency (CHN)|url= http://www.chnpress.com/tourism/Attractions/mazandaran}}</ref> Sari may be synonymous with the city of [[Zadracarta]] mentioned by Ancient Greek sources as early as the 6th century BCE ([[Achaemenid dynasty]]).<ref>Persien: Das Land und seine Bewohner: ethnograph. Schilderungen 2 Teile in 1 Bd, by Jakob Eduard Polak, (Olms, 1976)</ref> However, other sources suggest that modern [[Gorgan]] is located closer to, or on, the site of Zadracarta.
[[File:Iran, sari, coppa, x-xi sec..JPG|200px|thumb|Ancient dish found in Sari]]
According to [[Arrian]], this was the largest city of [[Hyrcania]]. The term means "the yellow city" and it was given to it because of the great number of orange, lemon, and other fruit trees that grew in the outskirts of that city. Hence it is by D'Anville, Rochette, and other geographers, identified Saru, which [[Pietro Della Valle]] says in his "Travels" means "the yellow city".

It is probable that Zadracarta and Saru are the same with the Syringis of Polybius, taken from Arsaces II by [[Antiochus the Great]], in his vain attempt to reunite the revolted provinces of Hyrcania and [[Parthia]] to the Syrian crown. Han Way, who visited Saru in 1734, makes mention of four ancient Magian temples as still standing then, built in the form of several rotundas, each thirty feet in diameter, and about 120 in height.

However [[William Ouseley|Sir William Ouseley]], who had travelled to the site in 1811, has speculated that these to be masses of brick masonry of the Mohammedan age. Out of four, one of the rotunda is still standing since the rest were overturned by an earthquake. This and other remains of similar buildings, bear the names of Fereydun, Salm, Tur, and other mythical figures, whose celebrity had been established about 2000 years prior to their erection. One of them Avas called the tomb of Kaus, and was supposed to contain the ashes of [[Cyrus the Great]]. Sir William Ouseley thinks it was that of Kabus, or Kaus, the son of Washmakin, who governed [[Mazandaran|Mazanderan]] in the fourth century of the Hejira.

It was at Saru that the ashes of the youthful hero, [[Sohrab|Sohraub]], were deposited by his father, [[Rostam|Roostum]], after he had unwittingly slayed Sohrab in a hand-to-hand battle. Saru is celebrated for its abundance of gardens, which emit a pleasing fragrance in the vernal and summer months. An oriental proverb declares that the "gates of paradise derive sweetness from the air of Sari and the flowers of [[Garden of Eden|Eden]] receive their fragrance from its soil". The city was again a regional capital in the [[Sassanid dynasty]] era.<ref name="Britannica">Britannica Article for Zadracarta</ref>

=== Capital of Tabaristan local rulers ===
In the seventh century, [[Farrukhan the Great]] of the [[Dabuyid dynasty]] reconstructed the city, and because his son's name was "Saruyeh", he called it by this name. Sari once again became the capital of [[Tabaristan]] during that century ([[Amol]] was the capital previously ).

After invasions by the successors of [[Mongol]]s, [[Timur]] of [[Uzbeks]], [[Oghuz Turks|Turcoman]], and [[Tatars]] the city lost its high status and was periodically burnt to ashes.

===Safavid-Qajar era===
Because [[Shah Abbas I]]'s [[Khayr al-Nisa Begum|mother]] was from [[Behshahr]] (Ashraf), he founded [[Farahabad, Mazandaran|Farahabad]] as his alternate capital of Persia in the north of the city and created the gardens in Ashraf. Mazandaran alongside neighboring [[Gilan]] were subsequently settled during Abbas' reign by large numbers of [[Georgian people|Georgians]], [[Circassian people|Circassians]], [[Armenians]] and other [[peoples of the Caucasus]], whose descendants still live across Mazandaran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/georgia-iv--2|title=Georgian communities in Persia|access-date=17 April 2014}}</ref><ref>^ Muliani, S.

After the [[Safavid dynasty]] fell and until the rise of [[Mohammad Khan Qajar|Agha Mohammad Khan]] to power there, is no evidence of any notable events in Sari.

===Early 20th century===
Major developments took place after the [[Qajar dynasty]]. During the reign of [[Reza Shah Pahlavi]], the face of the town was changed drastically. Sari Rail Station and most of the streets and governmental buildings date from that era. During World War II the [[Soviet army]] occupied the city, but left it after the war.

==Geography==
The coastline north of Sari fronts onto the ''[[Mazandaran Sea]]''; north-east of the city lies ''[[Neka]]''.
''[[Qa'emshahr]]'' (formerly known as Shahi) is to its south-west, ''[[Juybar]]'' is to its north-west,
and ''[[Kiasar]]'', ''[[Damghan]]'', and ''[[Semnan (city)|Semnan]]'' are cities located to the south.
