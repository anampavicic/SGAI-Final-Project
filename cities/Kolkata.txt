== Etymology ==
{{main|Etymology of Kolkata}}
The word ''Kolkata'' ({{langx|bn|কলকাতা}} {{IPA|bn|kolˈkata|}}) derives from ''[[Kalikata|Kôlikata]]'' ({{langx|bn|কলিকাতা|links=no}} {{IPA|bn|ˈkɔliˌkata|}}), the Bengali-language name of one of three villages that predated the arrival of the British; the other two villages were [[Sutanuti]] and [[Gobindapur, Kolkata|Govindapur]].<ref name="spatialchange">{{cite book |title=Globalizing cities: a new spatial order? |url=https://archive.org/details/globalizingcitie00marc |url-access=limited |last=Chakravorty |first=Sanjoy |editor1-last=Marcuse |editor1-first=Peter |editor2-last=Kempen |editor2-first=Ronald van |chapter=From colonial city to global city?

There are several explanations for the etymology of this name:
* ''Kolikata'' is thought to be a variation of ''Kalikkhetrô'' ({{Langx|bn|কালীক্ষেত্র}} {{IPA|bn|ˈkaliˌkʰetrɔ|}}), meaning 'Field of [the goddess] [[Kali]]'. Similarly, it can be a variation of ''Kalikshetra'' ([[Sanskrit]]: कालीक्षेत्र, lit. 'area of Goddess Kali').
* Another theory is that the name derives from [[Kalighat]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kalighattemple.com/ |title=Kalighat Kali Temple |website=kalighattemple.com |access-date=24 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917134630/http://kalighattemple.com/ |archive-date=17 September 2017}}</ref>
* Alternatively, the name may have been derived from the Bengali term ''kilkila'' ({{langx|bn|কিলকিলা}}), or 'flat area'.<ref name="chatterjeename">{{cite book |title=Water resources, conservation and management |last=Chatterjee |first=S.N. |year=2008 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers and Distributors |location=New Delhi |isbn=978-81-269-0868-4 |page=85 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lpREeIZQvrcC |access-date=29 January 2012 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130619194712/http://books.google.com/books?id=lpREeIZQvrcC |archive-date=19 June 2013}}</ref>
* The name may have its origin in the words ''khal'' ({{langx|bn|খাল}} {{IPA|bn|ˈkʰal|}}) meaning 'canal', followed by ''kaṭa'' ({{langx|bn|কাটা}} {{IPA|bn|ˈkaʈa|}}), which may mean 'dug'.<ref name="Nair">{{cite book |last=Nair |first=P. Thankappan |title=Calcutta in the 17th century |pages=54–58 |publisher=Firma KLM |location=Kolkata |year=1986}}</ref>
* According to another theory, the area specialised in the production of [[quicklime]] or ''koli chun'' ({{langx|bn|কলি চুন}} {{IPA|bn|ˈkɔliˌtʃun|}}) and coir or ''kata'' ({{langx|bn|কাতা}} {{IPA|bn|ˈkata|}}); hence, it was called ''Kolikata'').<ref name="chatterjeename" />
Although the city's name has always been pronounced ''Kolkata'' or ''Kôlikata'' in Bengali, the anglicised form ''Calcutta'' was the official name until 2001, when it [[Renaming of cities in India|was changed]] to ''Kolkata'' in order to match Bengali pronunciation.<ref>{{cite web |last=Easwaran |first=Kenny |url=http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~easwaran/papers/india.html |title=The politics of name changes in India |access-date=26 January 2012 |publisher=Open Computing Facility, University of California at Berkeley |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719150356/http://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~easwaran/papers/india.html |archive-date=19 July 2011}}</ref>

Kolkata is administered by several government agencies. The [[Kolkata Municipal Corporation]], or KMC, oversees and manages the civic infrastructure of the city's 16&nbsp;boroughs, which together encompass 144&nbsp;wards.<ref name="kmcbasicstat" /> Each ward elects a councillor to the KMC. Each borough has a committee of councillors, each of whom is elected to represent a ward. By means of the borough committees, the corporation undertakes urban planning and maintains roads, government-aided schools, hospitals, and municipal markets.<ref name="kmcfunction" /> As Kolkata's apex body, the corporation discharges its functions through the mayor-in-council, which comprises a [[Mayor of Kolkata|mayor]], a deputy mayor, and ten other elected members of the KMC.<ref name="kmcstructure">{{cite web |url=https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/downloads/structure.pdf |title=Legislative structure |publisher=Kolkata Municipal Corporation |access-date=3 December 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104193107/https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/downloads/structure.pdf |archive-date=4 January 2012 }}</ref> The functions of the KMC include water supply, drainage and sewerage, sanitation, solid waste management, street lighting, and building regulation.<ref name="kmcfunction">{{cite web |url=https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/jsp/KMCFunctions.jsp |title=KMC functions |publisher=Kolkata Municipal Corporation |access-date=3 December 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120104184545/https://www.kmcgov.in/KMCPortal/jsp/KMCFunctions.jsp |archive-date=4 January 2012}}</ref>
