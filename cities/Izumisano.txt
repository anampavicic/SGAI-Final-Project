==History==
The area of the modern city of Izumisano was within ancient [[Izumi Province]]. The area also had many [[Kofun period]] [[kofun|burial mounds]] from the 5th to 7th century AD. From the [[Kamakura period|Kamakura]] to the [[Muromachi period]] a large portion of the area was controlled by [[Hine-no-shō]], a large [[shōen|landed estate]] owned by the [[Kujō family]] of [[kuge|Court nobility]]. In the [[Edo Period]], much of the city area was controlled by [[Kishiwada Domain]] with smaller portions controlled directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]].

After the [[Meiji restoration]], the village of Sano established within Hine District with the creation of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. On  April 1, 1896, the area became part of [[Sennan District, Osaka]]. Sano was elevated to town status on October 1, 1911. Sano annexed the village of Kitanakado on April 1, 1937. On April 1, 1948, Sano was promoted to city status. To avoid confusion with [[Sano, Tochigi]], the city name was chosen to be Izumisano.On April 1, 1954, the city expanded to its present area by annexing the neighboring villages of Minaminakadori, Nagataki, Kaminogo, Hineno and Otsuchi. Kansai International Airport was opened on April 4, 1994, with [[Rinku Town]] commercial development opening in 1995.  Izumisano entered into discussions to merge with  Sennan, Misaki, Hannan and Tajiri to form the city of "Sennanshu" (南泉州市) from 2001 to 2004; however, per a public referendum, only Misaki was in favor of the merger and the plans were abandoned.

==Government==
Izumisano has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 18 members. Izumisano collectively with the cities of Kaizuka, Sennan, and the smaller municipalities of [[Sen'nan District, Osaka|Sen'nan District]] contributes two members to the [[Osaka Prefectural Assembly]]. In terms of national politics, the city is part of Osaka 19th district of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
The main industries of Izumisano remain food-related: agriculture, [[commercial fishing]] and food processing. The main crops are onions, eggplants, cabbage, and broccoli. Textile production is also important, with the city accounting for 47% of domestic towel production. Due to the proximity of Kansai International Airport, airport-support and aviation-related industries have increase.
