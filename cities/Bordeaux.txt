'''Bordeaux''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ɔːr|ˈ|d|oʊ}} {{respell|bor|DOH}}; {{IPA|fr|bɔʁdo|lang|Fr.Bordeaux.ogg}}; [[Gascon language|Gascon]] {{langx|oc|Bordèu}} {{IPA-oc|buɾˈðɛw|}}; {{langx|eu|Bordele}}) is a city on the river [[Garonne]] in the [[Gironde]] [[Departments of France|department]], southwestern France. A port city, it is the capital of the [[Nouvelle-Aquitaine]] region, as well as the [[Prefectures in France|prefecture]] of the Gironde department. Its inhabitants are called "''Bordelais''{{-"}} (masculine) or "''Bordelaises''{{-"}} (feminine). The term "Bordelais" may also refer to the city and its surrounding region.

Around 300 BC, the region was the settlement of a [[List of Celtic tribes|Celtic tribe]], the [[Bituriges Vivisci]], who named the town '''Burdigala''', probably of [[Aquitanian language|Aquitanian]] origin.

In 107 BC, the [[Battle of Burdigala]] was fought by the Romans who were defending the [[Allobroges]], a [[Gauls|Gallic tribe]] allied to Rome, and the [[Tigurini]] led by [[Divico]]. The Romans were defeated and their commander, the [[Roman consul|consul]] [[Lucius Cassius Longinus (consul 107 BC)|Lucius Cassius Longinus]], was killed in battle.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Sivan |first1=H. |first2=R. |last2=Mathisen |title=Places: 138248 (Burdigala) |url=https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |access-date=29 March 2020 |publisher=Pleiades |archive-date=18 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200918080522/https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/138248 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The city came under [[ancient Rome|Roman]] rule around 60 BC, and it became an important commercial centre for [[tin]] and [[lead]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.romanports.org/en/the-ports/116-burdigala.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200330034006/https://www.romanports.org/en/the-ports/116-burdigala.html |archive-date=30 March 2020 |url-status=live |title=Burdigala (France) |access-date=29 March 2020}}</ref> During this period were built the amphitheatre and the monument ''Les [[Piliers de Tutelle]]''.

In 276 AD, it was sacked by the [[Vandals]]. The Vandals attacked again in 409, followed by the [[Visigoths]] in 414, and the [[Franks]] in 498, and afterwards the city fell into a period of relative obscurity.

[[File:Merovingian tremisses minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint Etienne late 6th century.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Tremissis|tremisses]] minted in Bordeaux by the Church of Saint-Étienne, late sixth century. [[British Museum]].]]

In the late 6th century AD the city re-emerged as the seat of a county and an archdiocese within the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] [[Francia|kingdom of the Franks]], but royal Frankish power was never strong. The city started to play a regional role as a major urban center on the fringes of the newly founded Frankish [[Duchy of Vasconia]]. Around 585 Gallactorius was made [[County of Bordeaux|Count of Bordeaux]] and fought the [[Basques]].

In 732, the city was plundered by the troops of [[Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi|Abd er Rahman]] who stormed the fortifications and overwhelmed the [[Aquitaine|Aquitanian]] garrison. [[Odo the Great|Duke Eudes]] mustered a force to engage the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]], eventually engaging them in the [[Battle of the River Garonne]] somewhere near the river [[Dordogne (river)|Dordogne]]. The battle had a high death toll, and although Eudes was defeated he had enough troops to engage in the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and so retain his grip on Aquitaine.

In 737, following his father Eudes's death, the Aquitanian [[Hunald I|duke Hunald]] led a rebellion to which [[Charles Martel|Charles]] responded by launching an expedition that captured Bordeaux. However, it was not retained for long, during the following year the Frankish commander clashed in battle with the Aquitanians but then left to take on hostile Burgundian authorities and magnates. In 745 Aquitaine faced another expedition where Charles's sons Pepin and Carloman challenged Hunald's power and defeated him. Hunald's son [[Waiofar|Waifer]] replaced him and confirmed Bordeaux as the capital city (along with Bourges in the north).

During the last stage of the [[Pepin the Short#Expansion of the Frankish realm|war against Aquitaine]] (760–768), it was one of Waifer's last important strongholds to fall to the troops of King [[Pepin the Short]]. Charlemagne built the fortress of Fronsac (''Frontiacus'', ''Franciacus'') near Bordeaux on a hill across the border with the Basques (''Wascones''), where Basque commanders came and pledged their loyalty (769).

In 778, [[Seguin I of Gascony|Seguin (or Sihimin)]] was appointed count of Bordeaux, probably undermining the power of the Duke [[Lupo II of Gascony|Lupo]], and possibly leading to the [[Battle of Roncevaux Pass]]. In 814, Seguin was made Duke of [[Duchy of Vasconia|Vasconia]], but was deposed in 816 for failing to suppress a Basque rebellion. Under the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingians]], sometimes the [[Count of Bordeaux|Counts of Bordeaux]] held the title concomitantly with that of [[Duke of Gascony|Duke of Vasconia]]. They were to keep the Basques in check and defend the mouth of the Garonne from the [[Viking]]s when they appeared in c. 844. In Autumn 845, the Vikings were raiding Bordeaux and Saintes, count [[Seguin II of Gascony|Seguin II]] marched on them but was captured and executed.

Although the [[Port de la Lune|port of Bordeaux]] was a buzzing trade center, the stability and success of the city was threatened by [[Vikings|Viking]] and [[Normans|Norman]] incursions and political instability. The restoration of the [[Ramnulfids|Ramnulfid]] [[Duke of Aquitaine|Dukes of Aquitaine]] under [[William IV, Duke of Aquitaine|William IV]] and his successors (known as the [[House of Poitiers]]) brought continuity of government.<ref name="britannica">{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux |title=Bordeaux |website=Encyclopaedia Britannica |access-date=30 March 2020 |archive-date=28 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200428135852/https://www.britannica.com/place/Bordeaux |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== 12th century to 15th century, the English era ===
From the 12th to the 15th century, Bordeaux flourished once more following the marriage of [[Eleanor of Aquitaine|Eléonore]], Duchess of [[Duchy of Aquitaine|Aquitaine]] and the last of the [[House of Poitiers]], to [[Henry II of England|Henry II Plantagenêt]], [[Counts and dukes of Anjou|Count of Anjou]] and the grandson of [[Henry I of England]], who succeeded to the English crown months after their wedding, bringing into being the vast [[Angevin Empire]], which stretched from the [[Pyrenees]] to Ireland.<ref>''Le duché de Bretagne et la politique Plantagenêt aux XII et XIII siecles'', Judith Everard.

In 1462, Bordeaux created a local parliament.

Bordeaux adhered to the [[Fronde]], being effectively annexed to the [[Kingdom of France]] only in 1653, when the army of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] entered the city.

=== French Revolution: political disruption and loss of the most profitable colony ===
At the beginning of the [[French Revolution]] (1789), many local revolutionaries were members of the [[Girondists]]. This Party represented the provincial bourgeoisie, favorable towards abolishing aristocracy privileges, but opposed to the Revolution's social dimension. The Gironde valley's economic value and significance was satiated by the city's commercial power which was in dire contrast to the emerging widespread poverty affecting its inhabitants. Trade and commerce were the driving factors in the region's economic prosperity, still this resulted in a significant number of locals struggling to survive on a daily basis due to lack of food and resources. This socioeconomic disparity served as fertile ground for discontent, sparking frequent episodes of mass unrest well before the tumultuous events of 1783. [1]

In 1793, the [[Montagnard (French Revolution)|Montagnards]] led by [[Robespierre]] and [[Jean-Paul Marat|Marat]] came to power. Fearing a bourgeois misappropriation of the Revolution, they executed a great number of Girondists. During the purge, the local Montagnard Section renamed the city of Bordeaux "Commune-Franklin" (Franklin-municipality) in homage to [[Benjamin Franklin]].

At the same time, in 1791, a [[Haitian Revolution|slave revolt]] broke out at [[Saint-Domingue]] (current [[Haiti]]), the most profitable of the French colonies.In the lively era of the 18th century, Bordeaux emerged as a center of economic activity, particularly known at first for its successful wine trade. The city's placement along the Gironde River was very strategic, helping to facilitate the transportation of produce to markets both internationally and domestically, which led to an increase in exports and Bordeaux's economic prosperity. There was a significant transformation to the economic landscape of Bordeaux in 1785, which was spurred by the attraction of large profits, traders and merchants in Bordeaux began to turn their attention to the slave trade. This was a very important moment in the city's economic history seeing as it diversified its commercial expansion, at a serious moral cost. This introduced a new layer of difficulty to Bordeaux's economic activities. Even though it brought along significant wealth to certain segments of society, it complicated the socio-economic inconsistencies within the region. The entry into the slave trade brought even more tension within Bordeaux society. The trade exacerbated the divide between an elite with growing wealth and those living in poverty. This economic divide laid out the foundation for the mass unrest that would break out in the French Revolution. [2]

Three years later, the Montagnard Convention abolished slavery. In 1802, Napoleon revoked the manumission law but lost the war against the army of former slaves. In 1804, Haiti became independent. The loss of this "Pearl" of the West Indies generated the collapse of Bordeaux's port economy, which was dependent on the colonial trade and trade in slaves.

Towards the end of the [[Peninsular War]] of 1814, the [[Duke of Wellington]] sent [[William Beresford, 1st Viscount Beresford|William Beresford]] with two divisions and seized Bordeaux, encountering little resistance. Bordeaux was largely anti-[[Bonapartist]] and the majority supported the [[House of Bourbon|Bourbons]]. The British troops were treated as liberators. Distinguished historian of the French revolution Suzanne Desan explains that "examining intricate local dynamics" is essential to studying the Revolution by region. [3]

=== 19th century, rebirth of the economy ===
[[File:Hugo d'Alesi, vue cavalière de Bordeaux, 1899, Archives de Bordeaux métropole.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Aerial view of the [[Port of the Moon]] in 1899]]

From the [[Bourbon Restoration in France|Bourbon Restoration]], the economy of Bordeaux was rebuilt by traders and shipowners. They engaged to construct the first bridge of Bordeaux, and customs warehouses. The shipping traffic grew through the new [[French colonial empire|African colonies]].

[[Georges-Eugène Haussmann]], a longtime prefect of Bordeaux, used Bordeaux's 18th-century large-scale rebuilding as a model when he was asked by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] to transform the quasi-medieval Paris into a "modern" capital that would make France proud. [[Victor Hugo]] found the town so beautiful he said: "Take [[Versailles, Yvelines|Versailles]], add [[Antwerp]], and you have Bordeaux".

In 1870, at the beginning of the [[Franco-Prussian war]] against [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]], the French government temporarily relocated to Bordeaux from Paris.<ref name="britannica" /> That recurred during [[World War I]] and again very briefly during [[World War II]], when it became clear that Paris would fall into German hands.

=== 20th century ===

During World War II, Bordeaux fell under [[German military administration in occupied France during World War II|German occupation]].

In May and June 1940, Bordeaux was the site of the life-saving actions of the Portuguese consul-general, [[Aristides de Sousa Mendes]], who illegally granted thousands of Portuguese visas, which were needed to pass the Spanish border, to refugees fleeing the German occupation.

From 1941 to 1943, the [[Regia Marina|Italian Royal Navy]] established [[BETASOM]], a submarine base at Bordeaux. Italian submarines participated in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] from that base, which was also a major base for German [[U-boats]] as headquarters of [[12th U-boat Flotilla]]. The massive, reinforced concrete U-boat pens have proved impractical to demolish and are now partly used as a cultural center for exhibitions.<ref>{{Cite web |date=9 June 2020 |title=World's largest digital arts centre opens in Bordeaux submarine base |url=https://www.france24.com/en/20200609-world-s-largest-digital-arts-centre-opens-in-bordeaux-submarine-base |website=France 24 |language=en |access-date=9 July 2020 |archive-date=17 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200617071806/https://www.france24.com/en/20200609-world-s-largest-digital-arts-centre-opens-in-bordeaux-submarine-base |url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2007, 40% of the city surface area, located around the [[Port of the Moon]], was listed as [[World Heritage Site]]. [[UNESCO]] inscribed Bordeaux as "an inhabited historic city, an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble, created in the age of the Enlightenment, whose values continued up to the first half of the 20th century, with more protected buildings than any other French city except Paris".<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1256/ |title=Bordeaux, Port of the Moon |first=UNESCO World Heritage |last=Centre |website=UNESCO World Heritage Centre |access-date=30 October 2020 |archive-date=27 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027221056/https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1256 |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2020}}
[[File:Bordeaux_(France)_-_50524304173.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the [[Garonne]] in Bordeaux in 2019]]

Bordeaux is located close to the European [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] coast, in the southwest of France and in the north of the Aquitaine region. It is around {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of Paris. The city is built on a bend of the [[Garonne|river Garonne]], and is divided into two parts: the right bank to the east and left bank in the west. Historically the left bank is more developed because when flowing outside the bend, the water makes a furrow of the required depth to allow the passing of merchant ships, which used to offload on this side of the river. But, today, the right bank is developing, including new urban projects. In Bordeaux, the Garonne River is accessible to [[ocean liner]]s through the [[Gironde estuary]]. The right bank of the Garonne is a low-lying, often marshy plain.

=== Climate ===
Bordeaux's climate can be classified as [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfb''), bordering on a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/normales-records/1981-2010/bordeaux-merignac/valeurs/07510.html |title=Normales et records pour la période 1981–2010 [données officielles] à Bordeaux-Mérignac |access-date=8 November 2021 |publisher=Infoclimat.fr |archive-date=5 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211105035127/https://www.infoclimat.fr/climatologie/normales-records/1981-2010/bordeaux-merignac/valeurs/07510.html |url-status=live}}</ref> However, the [[Trewartha climate classification]] system classifies the city as solely humid subtropical, due to a recent rise in temperatures related – to some degree or another – to [[climate change]] and the city's [[urban heat island]].

The city enjoys cool to mild, wet winters, due to its relatively southerly [[latitude]], and the prevalence of mild, westerly winds from the Atlantic. Its summers are warm and somewhat drier, although wet enough to avoid a [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] classification. Frosts occur annually, but snowfall is quite infrequent, occurring for no more than 3–4 days a year. The [[2003 European heat wave|summer of 2003]] set a record with an average temperature of {{convert|23.3|°C|°F|abbr=on}},<ref>GHCN climate, GISS world climate averages, 1971–2000</ref> while February 1956 was the coldest month on record with an average temperature of −2.00&nbsp;°C at Bordeaux Mérignac-Airport.<ref>GISS Station Data v4 homogenized Bordeaux Mérignac Airport</ref>

== Economy ==
Bordeaux is a major centre for business in France as it has the sixth largest metropolitan population in France. It serves as a major regional center for trade, administration, services and industry.

=== Wine ===
{{Main|Bordeaux wine}}
[[File:Haut Brion exterior.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Château Haut-Brion]]]]

The vine was introduced to the Bordeaux region by the Romans, probably in the mid-first century, to provide wine for local consumption, and wine production has been continuous in the region since.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Johnson |first=Hugh |title=World Atlas of Wine |publisher=Octopus Publishing Group Ltd |year=1994 |edition=4th |location=London |page=13}}</ref>

[[File:1 Saint-Émilion aerial pano 2016.jpg|250px|thumb|[[Saint-Émilion]] aerial view]]

Bordeaux wine growing area has about {{convert|116160|ha|acre}} of [[vineyard]]s, 57 [[appellations]], 10,000 wine-producing estates (châteaux) and 13,000 grape growers. With an annual production of approximately 960&nbsp;million bottles,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bordeaux Wine Region in France: World's Most Famous Fine Wine Region |date=16 March 2007 |url=http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html |access-date=23 October 2009 |publisher=IntoWine.com |archive-date=19 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090919012556/http://www.intowine.com/bordeaux.html |url-status=live}}</ref> the Bordeaux area produces large quantities of everyday wine as well as some of the most expensive wines in the world. Included among the latter are the area's five ''premier cru'' ([[First Growth]]) red wines (four from [[Médoc]] and one, [[Château Haut-Brion]], from [[Graves (wine region)|Graves]]), established by the [[Bordeaux Wine Official Classification of 1855]]:

Both red and white wines are made in the Bordeaux region. Red Bordeaux wine is called [[claret]] in the United Kingdom. Red wines are generally made from a blend of grapes, and may be made from [[Cabernet Sauvignon]], [[Merlot]], [[Cabernet Franc]], [[Petit verdot]], [[Malbec]], and, less commonly in recent years, [[Carménère]].

White Bordeaux is made from [[Sauvignon blanc]], [[Sémillon]], and [[Muscadelle]]. [[Graves (wine region)|Sauternes]] is a sub-region of Graves known for its intensely sweet, white, [[dessert wine]]s such as [[Château d'Yquem]].

Because of a wine glut ([[wine lake]]) in the generic production, the price squeeze induced by an increasingly strong international competition, and [[vine pull schemes]], the number of growers has recently dropped from 14,000 and the area under vine has also decreased significantly. In the meantime, the global demand for first growths and the most famous labels markedly increased and their prices skyrocketed.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Mercer |first=Chris |date=2023-03-03 |title=Bordeaux agrees funding to pull up vineyards |url=https://www.decanter.com/wine-news/bordeaux-agrees-funding-to-pull-up-vineyards-498764/ |access-date=2024-04-22 |website=Decanter |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Pierre Hurmic en conseil municipal en février 2018.png|200px|thumb|The current mayor [[Pierre Hurmic]]]]

The Mayor of the city is the environmentalist [[Pierre Hurmic]].

Bordeaux is the capital of five cantons and the Prefecture of the [[Gironde]] and [[Aquitaine]].

The town is divided into three districts, the first three of Gironde. The headquarters of Urban Community of Bordeaux Mériadeck is located in the neighbourhood and the city is at the head of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry that bears his name.

The number of inhabitants of Bordeaux is greater than 250,000 and less than 299,999 so the number of municipal councilors is 65.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Archives/Archives-elections/Dossier-elections-municipales-2014/Annexe-4-Nombre-de-conseillers-municipaux-selon-la-population-de-la-commune |title=Annexe 4 – Nombre de conseillers municipaux selon la population de la commune |first=Ministère de |last=l'Intérieur |website=www.interieur.gouv.fr |access-date=2 July 2020 |archive-date=20 June 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200620130239/https://www.interieur.gouv.fr/Archives/Archives-elections/Dossier-elections-municipales-2014/Annexe-4-Nombre-de-conseillers-municipaux-selon-la-population-de-la-commune |url-status=live}}</ref> They are divided according to the following composition:

=== Elections ===

==== Presidential elections of 2007 ====
At the 2007 presidential election, the Bordelais gave 31.37% of their votes to [[Ségolène Royal]] of the Socialist Party against 30.84% to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], president of the UMP. Then came [[François Bayrou]] with 22.01%, followed by [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] who recorded 5.42%. None of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. Nationally, Nicolas Sarkozy led with 31.18%, then Ségolène Royal with 25.87%, followed by François Bayrou with 18.57%. After these came Jean-Marie Le Pen with 10.44%, none of the other candidates exceeded the 5% mark. In the second round, the city of Bordeaux gave Ségolène Royal 52.44% against 47.56% for Nicolas Sarkozy, the latter being elected [[President of the Republic]] with 53.06% against 46.94% for Ségolène Royal. The abstention rates for Bordeaux were 14.52% in the first round and 15.90% in the second round.

==== Parliamentary elections of 2007 ====
In the parliamentary elections of 2007, the left won eight constituencies against only three for the right. After the partial 2008 elections, the eighth district of Gironde switched to the left, bringing the count to nine. In Bordeaux, the left was for the first time in its history the majority as it held two of three constituencies following the elections. In the first division of the Gironde, the outgoing UMP MP [[Chantal Bourragué]] was well ahead with 44.81% against 25.39% for the Socialist candidate [[Béatrice Desaigues]]. In the second round, it was [[Chantal Bourragué]] who was re-elected with 54.45% against 45.55% for his socialist opponent. In the second district of Gironde the UMP mayor and all new Minister of Ecology, Energy, Sustainable Development and the Sea [[Alain Juppé]] confronted the General Counsel PS Michèle Delaunay. In the first round, Alain Juppé was well ahead with 43.73% against 31.36% for [[Michèle Delaunay]]. In the second round, it was finally Michèle Delaunay who won the election with 50.93% of the votes against 49.07% for Alain Juppé, the margin being only 670 votes. The defeat of the so-called constituency "Mayor" showed that Bordeaux was rocking increasingly left. Finally, in the third constituency of the Gironde, Noël Mamère was well ahead with 39.82% against 28.42% for the UMP candidate Elizabeth Vine. In the second round, Noël Mamère was re-elected with 62.82% against 37.18% for his right-wing rival.

==== Municipal elections of 2008 ====
In 2008 municipal elections saw the clash between mayor of Bordeaux, Alain Juppé and the President of the Regional Council of Aquitaine Socialist [[Alain Rousset]]. The PS had put up a Socialist heavyweight in the Gironde and had put great hopes in this election after the victory of Ségolène Royal and [[Michèle Delaunay]] in 2007. However, after a rather exciting campaign it was Alain Juppé who was widely elected in the first round with 56.62 percent, far ahead of Alain Rousset who garnered 34.14 percent of the vote. At present, of the eight cantons that has Bordeaux, five are held by the PS and three by the UMP, the left eating a little each time into the right's numbers.

==== European elections of 2009 ====
In the European elections of 2009, Bordeaux voters largely voted for the UMP candidate Dominique Baudis, who won 31.54% against 15.00% for PS candidate Kader Arif. The candidate of Europe Ecology José Bové came second with 22.34%. None of the other candidates reached the 10% mark. The 2009 European elections were like the previous ones in eight constituencies. Bordeaux is located in the district "Southwest", here are the results:

UMP candidate Dominique Baudis: 26.89%. His party gained four seats. PS candidate Kader Arif: 17.79%, gaining two seats in the European Parliament. Europe Ecology candidate Bove: 15.83%, obtaining two seats. MoDem candidate Robert Rochefort: 8.61%, winning a seat. Left Front candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon: 8.16%, gaining the last seat. At regional elections in 2010, the Socialist incumbent president Alain Rousset won the first round by totaling 35.19% in Bordeaux, but this score was lower than the plan for Gironde and Aquitaine. Xavier Darcos, Minister of Labour followed with 28.40% of the votes, scoring above the regional and departmental average. Then came Monique De Marco, Green candidate with 13.40%, followed by the member of Pyrenees-Atlantiques and candidate of the MoDem Jean Lassalle who registered a low 6.78% while qualifying to the second round on the whole Aquitaine, closely followed by Jacques Colombier, candidate of the National Front, who gained 6.48%. Finally the candidate of the Left Front Gérard Boulanger with 5.64%, no other candidate above the 5% mark. In the second round, Alain Rousset had a tidal wave win as national totals rose to 55.83%. If Xavier Darcos largely lost the election, he nevertheless achieved a score above the regional and departmental average obtaining 33.40%. Jean Lassalle, who qualified for the second round, passed the 10% mark by totaling 10.77%. The ballot was marked by abstention amounting to 55.51% in the first round and 53.59% in the second round.

{{Main|University of Bordeaux}}

[[File:Universite Bordeaux 2-Victoire.JPG|250px|thumb|University Bordeaux 2, former faculty of medicine, now faculty of sociology]]

During Antiquity, a first university had been created by the Romans in 286.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.bordeaux.fr/p7070/gallo-romains-56-4e-siecle- |title=Gallo-romains (−56 / 4e siècle) |website=Site officiel de la ville de Bordeaux |access-date=5 July 2020 |archive-date=23 September 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200923055132/http://www.bordeaux.fr/p7070/gallo-romains-56-4e-siecle- |url-status=live}}</ref> The city was an important administrative centre and the new university had to train administrators. Only [[rhetoric]] and [[grammar]] were taught. [[Ausonius]] and [[Sulpicius Severus]] were two of the teachers.

In 1441, when Bordeaux was an English town, the [[Pope Eugene IV]] created a university by demand of the archbishop [[Pey Berland]]. In 1793, during the [[French Revolution]], the [[National Convention]] abolished the university, and replace them with the [[École centrale]] in 1796. In Bordeaux, this one was located in the former buildings of the college of Guyenne.
In 1808, the university reappeared with [[Napoleon]]. Bordeaux accommodates approximately 70,000 students on one of the largest campuses of Europe (235&nbsp;ha).<ref>{{in lang|fr}} Université de Bordeaux website: [http://www.univ-bordeaux.fr/ www.univ-bordeaux.fr] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130420064411/http://www.univ-bordeaux.fr/ |date=20 April 2013 }}; retrieved 7 December 2010.</ref>

=== Heritage and architecture ===

Bordeaux is classified "City of Art and History". The city is home to 362 ''[[monuments historiques]]'' (only Paris has more in France) with some buildings dating back to Roman times. Bordeaux, [[Port of the Moon]], has been inscribed on [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage List]] as "an outstanding urban and architectural ensemble".

Bordeaux is home to one of Europe's biggest 18th-century architectural urban areas, making it a sought-after destination for tourists and cinema production crews. It stands out as one of the first French cities, after [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], to have entered an era of [[urbanism]] and metropolitan big scale projects, with the team Gabriel father and son, architects for King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], under the supervision of two intendants (Governors), first [[Nicolas-François Dupré de Saint-Maur]] then the Marquis de Tourny.

Saint-André Cathedral, Saint-Michel Basilica and Saint-Seurin Basilica are part of the [[World Heritage Sites of the Routes of Santiago de Compostela in France]]. The organ in [[Saint-Louis-des-Chartrons]] is registered on the French [[monuments historiques]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Orgue de tribune : partie instrumentale de l'orgue |url=https://www.pop.culture.gouv.fr/notice/palissy/PM33001025 |access-date=26 February 2021 |website=www.pop.culture.gouv.fr |archive-date=27 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227183606/https://www.pop.culture.gouv.fr/notice/palissy/PM33001025 |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Memory of slavery ===
Slavery was part of a growing drive for the city. Firstly, during the 18th and 19th centuries, Bordeaux was an important [[Slave Trade|slave port]], which saw some 500 slave expeditions that cause the deportation of 150,000 Africans by Bordeaux shipowners.<ref>{{Cite book |last=François Hubert, Christian Block and Jacques de Cauna |title=Bordeaux in the 18th century: trans-Atlantic trading and slavery |publisher=Le Festin |year=2010 |isbn=978-2-36062-009-8 |location=Bordeaux}}</ref> Secondly, even though the "[[Triangular trade]]" represented only 5% of Bordeaux's wealth, the city's direct trade with the Caribbean, that accounted for the other 95%, concerns the colonial stuffs made by the slave (sugar, coffee, cocoa).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20190224-bordeaux-slavery-museum-seeks-change-narrative-slave-trade-past |title=Bordeaux museum working to change narrative on slavery past |date=24 February 2019 |website=RFI |access-date=7 January 2021 |archive-date=29 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029161157/https://www.rfi.fr/en/france/20190224-bordeaux-slavery-museum-seeks-change-narrative-slave-trade-past |url-status=live}}</ref> And thirdly, in that same period, a major migratory movement by Aquitanians took place to the Caribbean colonies, with [[Saint-Domingue]] (now [[Haiti]]) being the most popular destination. 40% of the white population of the island came from [[Aquitaine]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Jacques de Cauna |title=''L'Eldorado des Aquitains.

A statue of [[Modeste Testas]], an Ethiopian woman who was enslaved by the Bordeaux-based Testas brothers was unveiled in 2019. She was trafficked by them from West Africa, to Philadelphia (where one of the brothers coerced her to have two children by him) and was ultimately freed and lived in Haiti. The bronze sculpture was created by the Haitian artists [[Woodly Caymitte]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Haiti – Memory : Bordeaux inaugurates the statue of a slave of the Haitian sculptor, C.

A number of traces and memorial sites are visible in the city. Moreover, in May 2009, the [[Museum of Aquitaine]] opened the spaces dedicated to "Bordeaux in the 18th century, trans-Atlantic trading and slavery". This work, richly illustrated with original documents, contributes to disseminate the state of knowledge on this question, presenting above all the facts and their chronology.<ref name="musee-aquitaine-bordeaux.fr" />

The region of Bordeaux was also the land of several prominent [[abolitionism|abolitionists]], as [[Montesquieu]], [[André-Daniel Laffon de Ladebat|Laffon de Ladébat]] and [[Elisée Reclus]]. Others were members of the [[Society of the Friends of the Blacks]] as the revolutionaries [[Jean-Baptiste Boyer-Fonfrède|Boyer-Fonfrède]], [[Armand Gensonné|Gensonné]], [[Marguerite-Élie Guadet|Guadet]] and [[Jean-François Ducos|Ducos]].

=== Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas ===
[[File:Bordeaux - Pont Chaban Delmas sur la Garonne.jpg|thumb|[[Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas|Chaban Delmas bridge]]]]

Europe's longest-span [[vertical-lift bridge]], the [[Pont Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], was opened in 2013 in Bordeaux, spanning the River Garonne. The central lift span is {{convert|117|m|ft|0|adj=mid|abbr=off|-long}}, weighs 4,600 tons and can be lifted vertically up to {{convert|53|m|ft|0|abbr=off}} to let tall ships pass underneath. The €160&nbsp;million bridge was inaugurated by President [[François Hollande]] and Mayor Alain Juppé on 16 March 2013. The bridge was named after the late [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]], who was a former Prime Minister and [[Mayor (France)|Mayor]] of Bordeaux.

=== Shopping ===
[[File:Rue Sainte Catherine - Bordeaux (FR33) - 2022-09-10 - 2.jpg|thumb|''Rue Sainte-Catherine'']]

Bordeaux has many shopping options. In the heart of Bordeaux is ''[[Sainte-Catherine Street (Bordeaux)|Rue Sainte-Catherine]]''. This pedestrian-only shopping street has {{convert|1.2|km|mi|sp=us}} of shops, restaurants and cafés; it is also one of the longest shopping streets in Europe. ''Rue Sainte-Catherine'' starts at ''Place de la Victoire'' and ends at ''Place de la Comédie'' by the ''Grand Théâtre''. The shops become progressively more upmarket as one moves towards ''Place de la Comédie'' and the nearby ''Cours de l'Intendance'' is where one finds the more exclusive shops and boutiques.

=== Culture ===
Bordeaux is also the first city in France to have created, in the 1980s, an architecture exhibition and research centre, ''[[Arc en rêve]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arcenreve.eu/le-projet|title=Arc en rêve: centre d'architecture|publisher=Arc en rêve|access-date=24 June 2024|language=French|trans-title=Arc en rêve: architecture center}}</ref> Bordeaux offers a large number of cinemas, theatres, and is the home of the [[Grand Théâtre de Bordeaux|Opéra national de Bordeaux]]. There are many music venues of varying capacity. The city also offers several festivals throughout the year. In October 2021, Bordeaux was shortlisted for the [[European Commission]]'s 2022 European Capital of Smart Tourism award along with [[Copenhagen]], [[Dublin]], [[Florence]], [[Ljubljana]], [[Palma de Mallorca]] and [[Valencia]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=2022 European Capital of Smart Tourism – Competition winners 2022 |url=https://smart-tourism-capital.ec.europa.eu/cities/competition-winners-2022_en |website=European Commission |date=2 October 2021 |access-date=8 November 2022 |archive-date=7 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221107212251/https://smart-tourism-capital.ec.europa.eu/cities/competition-winners-2022_en |url-status=live}}</ref>

== Transport ==
=== Road ===
Bordeaux is an important road and [[Interchange (road)|motorway junction]]. The city is connected to Paris by the [[A10 autoroute (France)|A10]] motorway, with Lyon by the [[A89 autoroute|A89]], with Toulouse by the [[A62 autoroute|A62]], and with Spain by the [[A63 autoroute|A63]]. There is a {{convert|45|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Beltway|ring road]] called the "[[Rocade de Bordeaux|Rocade]]" which is often very busy. Another ring road is under consideration.

[[File:Pont d'Aquitaine, Bordeaux.JPG|200px|thumb|[[Pont d'Aquitaine]]]]

Bordeaux has five road bridges that cross the [[Garonne]], the Pont de pierre built in the 1820s and three modern bridges built after 1960: the Pont Saint Jean, just south of the Pont de pierre (both located downtown), the [[Pont d'Aquitaine]], a suspension bridge downstream from downtown, and the Pont François Mitterrand, located upstream of downtown. These two bridges are part of the ring-road around Bordeaux. A fifth bridge, the [[Pont Jacques-Chaban-Delmas]], was constructed in 2009–2012 and opened to traffic in March 2013. Located halfway between the Pont de pierre and the Pont d'Aquitaine and serving downtown rather than highway traffic, it is a [[vertical-lift bridge]] with a height in closed position comparable to that of Pont de pierre, and to the Pont d'Aquitaine when open. All five road bridges, including the two highway bridges, are open to cyclists and pedestrians as well. Another bridge, the Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc, is to be built in 2018.<ref>{{Cite web |date=24 October 2013 |title=Pont Jean-Jacques Bosc – La CUB |url=http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024224845/http://www.lacub.fr/grands-projets/pont-jean-jacques-bosc |archive-date=24 October 2013}}</ref>

Lacking any steep hills, Bordeaux is relatively friendly to cyclists. Cycle paths (separate from the roadways) exist on the highway bridges, along the riverfront, on the university campuses, and incidentally elsewhere in the city. [[Bike lane|Cycle lanes]] and [[bus lane]]s that explicitly allow cyclists exist on many of the city's boulevards. A paid [[bicycle-sharing system]] with automated stations was established in 2010.

=== Rail ===
[[File:Bordeaux Gare StJean R01.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]]]]

The main railway station, [[Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean]], near the center of the city, has 12&nbsp;million passengers a year. It is served by the French national ([[SNCF]]) railway's high speed train, the [[TGV]], that gets to Paris in two hours, with connections to major European centers such as [[Lille]], Brussels, [[Amsterdam]], [[Cologne]], Geneva and London. The TGV also serves [[Toulouse]] and [[Irun]] (Spain) from Bordeaux. A regular train service is provided to [[Nantes]], Nice, [[Marseille]] and [[Lyon]]. The Gare Saint-Jean is the major hub for regional trains ([[Transport express régional|TER]]) operated by the SNCF to [[Arcachon]], [[Limoges]], [[Agen]], [[Périgueux]], [[Langon, Gironde|Langon]], [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], Le Médoc, Angoulême and [[Bayonne]].

Historically the train line used to terminate at a station on the right bank of the river Garonne near the Pont de Pierre, and passengers crossed the bridge to get into the city. Subsequently, a double-track steel railway bridge was constructed in the 1850s, by [[Gustave Eiffel]], to bring trains across the river direct into Gare de Bordeaux Saint-Jean. The old station was later converted and in 2010 comprised a cinema and restaurants.

The two-track Eiffel bridge with a speed limit of {{convert|30|km/h|0|abbr=on}} became a bottleneck and a new bridge was built, opening in 2009. The new bridge has four tracks and allows trains to pass at {{convert|60|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>[http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html Pont Ferroviaire de Bordeaux] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521131358/http://aquitaine.fr/politiques-regionales/transports/pont-ferroviaire-de-bordeaux.html |date=21 May 2011 }} on aquitaine.fr</ref> During the planning there was much lobbying by the Eiffel family and other supporters to preserve the old bridge as a footbridge across the Garonne, with possibly a museum to document the history of the bridge and Gustave Eiffel's contribution. The decision was taken to save the bridge, but by early 2010 no plans had been announced as to its future use. The bridge remains intact, but unused and without any means of access.

The [[LGV Sud Europe Atlantique]] became fully operational in July 2017, shortening the journey time from Bordeaux city to Paris to 2hrs 4mins.

=== Air ===
[[File:Tour Bordeaux.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport]]]]

Bordeaux is served by [[Bordeaux–Mérignac Airport]], located {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the city centre in the suburban city of [[Mérignac, Gironde|Mérignac]].

=== Trams, buses and boats ===
[[File:Bordeaux tram kruising I.jpg|200px|thumb|[[Tramway de Bordeaux]]]]

Bordeaux has an important public transport system called [[Transports Bordeaux Métropole]] (TBM). This company is run by the Keolis group. The network consists of:
* Four [[Tramway de Bordeaux|tram lines]] ([[Bordeaux Tramway Line A|A]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line B|B]], [[Bordeaux Tramway Line C|C]] and [[Bordeaux Tramway Line D|D]])
* 75 [[Bus lines in Bordeaux|bus routes]], all connected to the tramway network (from 1 to 96)
* 13 night bus routes (from 1 to 16)
* An [[Trolleybus|electric bus]] shuttle in the city centre
* A boat shuttle on the Garonne river

This network is operated from 5&nbsp;am to 2&nbsp;am.

There had been several plans for a subway network to be set up, but they stalled for both geological and financial reasons. Work on the [[Tramway de Bordeaux]] system was started in the autumn of 2000, and services started in December 2003 connecting Bordeaux with its suburban areas. The tram system uses [[Alstom APS]] a form of [[ground-level power supply]] technology developed by French company [[Alstom]] and designed to preserve the aesthetic environment by eliminating overhead cables in the historic city. Conventional overhead cables are used outside the city. The system was controversial for its considerable cost of installation, maintenance and also for the numerous initial technical problems that paralysed the network. Many streets and squares along the tramway route became pedestrian areas, with [[Limited-access road|limited access]] for cars.

The Bordeaux Tramway system reached the Mérignac airport on April 29th 2023 with the opening of a 5-km extension of Line A.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2 May 2023 |title=Bordeaux tramway reaches the airport |url=https://www.railwaygazette.com/light-rail-and-tram/bordeaux-tramway-reaches-the-airport/64054.article |website=Railway Gazette |access-date=3 June 2024 |archive-date=29 May 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230529045414/https://www.railwaygazette.com/light-rail-and-tram/bordeaux-tramway-reaches-the-airport/64054.article |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== Taxis ===
There are more than 400 [[taxicab]]s in Bordeaux.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bordeaux.fr/p1247/en-taxi|title=En taxi|publisher=Ville de Bordeaux|access-date=24 June 2024|language=French|trans-title=By taxi}}</ref>

=== Public transportation statistics ===

The 41,458-capacity [[Nouveau Stade de Bordeaux]] is the largest stadium in Bordeaux. The stadium was opened in 2015 and replaced the [[Stade Chaban-Delmas]], which was a venue for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 1938 and 1998, as well as the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]]. In the [[1938 FIFA World Cup]], it hosted a violent quarter-final known as the [[Battle of Bordeaux (football)|Battle of Bordeaux]]. The ground was formerly known as the ''Stade du Parc Lescure'' until 2001, when it was renamed in honour of the city's long-time mayor, [[Jacques Chaban-Delmas]].

There are two major sport teams in Bordeaux, [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] is the [[association football|football]] team who, following administrative relegation, currently play in [[Championnat National 2]], the fourth tier of [[French football league system|French football]]. They are one of the most successful clubs in France, with six [[Ligue 1|Division 1/Ligue 1]] titles. [[Union Bordeaux Bègles]] is a [[rugby union|rugby]] team in the [[Top 14]] in the [[National Rugby League (France)|Ligue Nationale de Rugby]]. Skateboarding, rollerblading, and BMX biking are activities enjoyed by many young inhabitants of the city. Bordeaux is home to a quay which runs along the Garonne river. On the quay there is a skate-park divided into three sections. One section is for Vert tricks, one for street style tricks, and one for little action sports athletes with easier features and softer materials. The skate-park is very well maintained by the municipality.

Other sports clubs include top flight ice hockey team [[Boxers de Bordeaux]] and third-tier basketball team [[JSA Bordeaux Basket]]

Bordeaux is also the home to one of the strongest [[cricket]] teams in France and are champions of the South West League.

There is a {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} wooden [[velodrome]], Vélodrome du Lac, in Bordeaux which hosts international cycling competition in the form of [[UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics|UCI Track Cycling World Cup]] events.

The 2015 Trophee Eric Bompard was in Bordeaux. But the Free Skate was cancelled in all of the divisions due to the Paris {{Not a typo|bombing(s)}} and aftermath. The Short Program occurred hours before the bombing. French skaters Chafik Besseghier (68.36) in tenth place, Romain Ponsart (62.86) in 11th. Mae-Berenice-Meite (46.82) in 11th and Laurine Lecavelier (46.53) in 12th. Vanessa James/Morgan Cipres (65.75) in second.

Between 1951 and 1955, an annual Formula 1 motor race was held on a 2.5-kilometre circuit which looped around the Esplanade des Quinconces and along the waterfront, attracting drivers such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], [[Stirling Moss]], [[Jean Behra]] and [[Maurice Trintignant]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pike |first=Tim |title=When Bordeaux city centre became a Formula 1 racing track |url=http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |access-date=6 September 2019 |website=invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com |archive-date=6 September 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190906063233/http://invisiblebordeaux.blogspot.com/2014/07/when-bordeaux-city-centre-became.html |url-status=live}}</ref>
