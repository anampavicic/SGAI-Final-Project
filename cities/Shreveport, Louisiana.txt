==History==
{{Main|History of Shreveport, Louisiana|Timeline of Shreveport, Louisiana}}

===Early settlers===
Shreveport was established to create a town at the meeting point of the Brown Bricks and the Texas Trail. The Red River was made navigable by Captain [[Henry Miller Shreve]], who led the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] efforts to clear the Red River. A {{convert|180|mi|km|adj=mid|-long}} natural log jam, the [[Great Raft]], had previously obstructed passage to shipping. Shreve used a specially modified [[riverboat]], the ''Heliopolis'', to remove the log jam. The company and the village of Shreve Town were named in Shreve's honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.shreveport.la.us/history.htm |title=Shreveport: a Brief History |author=Brock, Eric J. |year=2006 |publisher=City of Shreveport, Louisiana |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608103601/http://www.ci.shreveport.la.us/history.htm |archive-date=June 8, 2009}}</ref>

Shreve Town was originally contained within the boundaries of a piece of land sold to the company in 1835 by the indigenous [[Caddo Indians]]. In 1838 [[Caddo Parish]] was created from the large [[Natchitoches Parish]], and Shreve Town became its parish seat. On March 20, 1839, the town was incorporated as Shreveport. Originally, the town consisted of 64 city blocks, created by eight streets running west from the Red River and eight streets running south from Cross Bayou, one of its tributaries.

Shreveport soon became a center of [[steamboat]] commerce, carrying mostly cotton and agricultural crops from the plantations of Caddo Parish. Shreveport also had a [[slavery in the United States|slave]] market, though slave trading was not as widespread as in other parts of the state. Steamboats plied the Red River, and [[stevedore]]s loaded and unloaded cargo. By 1860, Shreveport had a population of 2,200 free people and 1,300 slaves within the city limits.

===Civil War and Reconstruction===
During the [[American Civil War]], Shreveport was the capital of Louisiana from 1863 to 1865, having succeeded [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]] after each fell under [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] control. The city was a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] stronghold throughout the war and was the site of the headquarters of the [[Trans-Mississippi Department]] of the Confederate Army. Fort Albert Sidney Johnston was built on a ridge northwest of the city. Because of limited development in that area, the site is relatively undisturbed in the 21st century.

Isolated from events in the east, the Civil War continued in the Trans-Mississippi theater for several weeks after [[Robert E. Lee]]'s surrender in April 1865, and the Trans-Mississippi was the last Confederate command to surrender, on May 26, 1865. "The period May 13–21, 1865, was filled with great uncertainly after soldiers learned of the surrenders of Lee and Johnston, the Good Friday assassination of President [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the rapid departure of their own generals."<ref name="prime">[https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/local/2015/05/10/history-mayhem-marked-civil-war-end/27084699/ John Andrew Prime, "Our History: Mayhem marked Civil War's end here"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180613021809/https://www.shreveporttimes.com/story/news/local/2015/05/10/history-mayhem-marked-civil-war-end/27084699/ |date=June 13, 2018}}, ''Shreveport Times'', May 10, 2015; accessed May 5, 2018</ref> In the confusion there was a breakdown of military discipline and rioting by soldiers. They destroyed buildings containing service records, a loss that later made it difficult for many to gain Confederate pensions from state governments.<ref name="prime"/>

The Red River, opened by Shreve in the 1830s, remained navigable throughout the Civil War. But seasonal water levels got so low at one point that Union [[Admiral]] [[David Dixon Porter]] was trapped with his gunboats north of [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]]. His engineers quickly constructed a temporary dam to raise the water level and free his fleet.

In 1873, Shreveport lost 759 citizens in an 80-day period to a [[yellow fever]] epidemic, with over 400 additional victims eventually succumbing. The total death toll from August through November was approximately 1,200.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-PHCH/Center-CH/infectious-epi/Annuals/LaIDAnnual_YellowFever.pdf|title=Louisiana Office of Public Health Statistics, page 6|website=Ldh.la.gov|access-date=September 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190204032113/http://ldh.la.gov/assets/oph/Center-PHCH/Center-CH/infectious-epi/Annuals/LaIDAnnual_YellowFever.pdf|archive-date=February 4, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.oaklandcemeteryla.org/Tour/Tour-Stop-1.aspx|title=Tour Stop 1 – Yellow Fever Victims – Tour – Oakland Cemetery – Shreveport – Louisiana – Founded 1847|website=Oaklandcemeteryla.org|access-date=September 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928202518/http://www.oaklandcemeteryla.org/Tour/Tour-Stop-1.aspx|archive-date=September 28, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> Five Roman Catholic priests in the city and two religious sisters died while caring for yellow fever victims in the city.<ref>Archives, Diocese of Shreveport</ref>

===20th century to present===
[[Greenwood Cemetery (Shreveport, Louisiana)|Greenwood Cemetery]] was established in 1893. A number of local African American musicians became nationally famous. By the 1910s, [[Lead Belly|Huddie William Ledbetter]]—also known as "Lead Belly", a [[blues]] singer and guitarist—was performing for Shreveport audiences in St. Paul's Bottoms, the notable [[red-light district]] of Shreveport that operated legally from 1903 to 1917. Ledbetter began to develop his own style of music after exposure to a variety of musical influences on Fannin Street, a row of saloons, [[brothel]]s, and dance halls in the Bottoms. Bluesmen [[Jesse Thomas (musician)|Jesse Thomas]], [[Dave Alexander (blues musician)|Dave Alexander]], and [[Kenny Wayne Shepherd]], and the early [[jazz]] and [[ragtime]] composers Bill Wray and Willian Christopher O'Hare were all from Shreveport. Lead Belly achieved international fame.

By 1914, neglect and lack of use, due to diversion of freight traffic to railroad lines, resulted in the Red River becoming unnavigable. In projects accomplished over decades, in 1994, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] restored navigability by completion of a series of federally funded lock-and-dam structures and a navigation channel.

As early as 1924, the citizens of Shreveport became interested in hosting a military flying field. In 1926, Shreveport citizens learned that the 3rd Attack Wing stationed at [[Fort Crockett]], Texas, would be enlarged by 500 percent and would require at least 20,000 acres (81 km<sup>2</sup>) to support aerial gunnery and a bombing range. The efforts to procure the government's commitment to build the facility in the Greater Shreveport metropolitan area were spearheaded by a committee co-chaired by local civic leaders Andrew Querbes and [[John D. Ewing]], beginning in 1927. It took a great deal of correspondence between the interested parties and the original proposal was rejected. However, in February 1928, a young crop duster, an Air Corps captain named Harold Ross Harris, was hired to fly over the local area in order to find a suitable site for the airfield.

Captain Harris selected what he felt was an adequate location for a military airfield. It was a sprawling section of cotton plantation near Bossier City. The site selection committee, representing the wealthiest taxpayers in the city, unanimously agreed upon the Barksdale Field location. A delegation of citizens traveled to [[Washington, D.C.]], to personally present the advantages of the proposed site to the [[United States Department of War|War Department]]. Following the return of this delegation, a special army board visited Shreveport and reported the location met all requirements of the Air Corps.

The site was selected December 5, 1928, as the location of the airfield. The land in Bossier Parish on which the airfield was built was unincorporated land near Bossier City that was annexed by the city of Shreveport once the site had been selected among 80 candidates. The real estate was purchased from over 800 property owners via a $1,500,000 [[municipal bond]] issue approved by Shreveport voters in 1929 in fulfillment of the pledge that the citizens of Shreveport made to the U.S. government. The last of these bonds matured on December 31, 1959. After acquisition, Shreveport then donated the land to the federal government per their agreement, while the federal government assumed all the costs of building construction and equipment installation. Shreveport had originally proposed a site adjacent to [[Cross Lake (Shreveport, Louisiana)|Cross Lake]], but the United States Department of War deemed this location inappropriate due to the lack of suitable terrain for the facility's future expansion. Subsequent to the establishment of the military installation, Bossier City grew and expanded southward and eastward, eventually enveloping the area surrounding the base. Technically, [[Barksdale Air Force Base|Barksdale AFB]] is neither in Bossier City nor Shreveport but, like all military bases, is an autonomous community with its own infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Dy2G-wG-eoAC|title=Eric Brock's Shreveport|first=Brock, Eric|last=J|date=January 31, 2001|publisher=Pelican Publishing|isbn=9781455603862|via=Google Books}}</ref>
 
In September, 1941, the capture of the city of Shreveport was the objective of a U.S. Army war game, or [[military exercise]], known as the [[Louisiana Maneuvers]]. The field exercise's mission was accomplished largely due to General [[George S. Patton]], who commanded the mock "Blue" army's 2nd Armored Division.<ref name="The Louisiana Maneuvers, The National WWII Museum New Orleans">{{cite web

[[File:Elvis in Louisiana Hayride.JPG|thumb|304x304px|[[Elvis Presley|Elvis]] in the Louisiana Hayride]]
Shreveport was home to the ''[[Louisiana Hayride]]'' radio program, broadcast weekly from the [[Shreveport Municipal Memorial Auditorium]]. During its heyday from 1948 to 1960, this program stimulated the careers of some of the greatest figures in American music. The ''Hayride'' featured musicians including [[Hank Williams]] and [[Elvis Presley]], who made his broadcasting debut at this venue. In the mid-1950s, [[KWKH]] was the first major radio station to feature the music of Presley on its long-running ''Louisiana Hayride'' program at the Shreveport Municipal Auditorium. Horace Logan, long-term KWKH program manager and originator of the ''Hayride'', and Frank Page introduced Presley on the ''Hayride''.

African American veterans of World War II were among activists in Shreveport through the 1960s who worked in the [[civil rights movement]] to correct injustices under [[Jim Crow]] and [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of blacks. While activism gradually increased, 1963 was a particularly violent year in Shreveport because of white resistance. The Shreveport home of Dr. C. O.

In September 1963 [[George W. D'Artois]], Public Service Commissioner, refused a permit for a march to the Little Union Baptist Church in Shreveport, where mourners gathered to honor and commemorate four black girls killed in the [[16th Street Baptist Church Bombing]] on September 15 in [[Birmingham, Alabama]].

Also in 1963, headlines across the country reported that African American musician [[Sam Cooke]] was arrested in Shreveport after his band tried to register at a "whites-only" [[Holiday Inn]], where they planned to stay before performing in the city. Public facilities in Louisiana were still segregated.<ref>{{cite news |title=Negro Band Leader Held in Shreveport |work=The New York Times |date=October 9, 1963}}</ref> In the months following, Cooke recorded the civil rights era song, "[[A Change Is Gonna Come]]". In 1964 Congress passed the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights Act]] to end segregation of public facilities.

In the mid-1990s, the coming of [[riverboat gambling]] to Shreveport attracted numerous new patrons to the downtown and spurred a revitalization of the adjacent riverfront areas. Many downtown streets were given a facelift through the "Streetscape" project. Traditional brick sidewalks and crosswalks were built, and statues, sculptures, and [[mosaic]]s were added to create a better pedestrian environment. The O.K. Allen Bridge, commonly known as the [[Long–Allen Bridge (Shreveport)|Texas Street bridge]], was lit with [[neon light]]s. Residents predictably had a variety of reactions to these changes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ci.shreveport.la.us/mayorpr/pr2000/082300.neon.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512062326/http://www.ci.shreveport.la.us/mayorpr/pr2000/082300.neon.htm|url-status=dead|title=Notice from City of Shreveport regarding bridge repairs|archive-date=May 12, 2008}}</ref> Shreveport was named an [[All-America City Award|All-American City]] in 1953, 1979, and 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncl.org/aac/past_winners/past_winners.html |title=Past Winners of the All-America City Award |publisher=[[National Civic League]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707222907/http://www.ncl.org/aac/past_winners/past_winners.html |archive-date=July 7, 2010}}</ref>

Among its Methodist churches has been the large [[First Methodist Church (Shreveport, Louisiana)|First Methodist Church]], established in 1884. The current edifice dates to 1913.

Shreveport was formerly a major player in United States oil business, and once hosted a branch office of [[Standard Oil]] aka [[Standard Oil of Louisiana]]. The Louisiana branch was later absorbed by [[Standard Oil of New Jersey]]. Beginning in 1930, [[United Gas Corporation]], the nation's busiest pipeline operator and massive integrated oil company, was headquartered in Shreveport. [[Pennzoil]] performed a [[hostile takeover]] in 1968, and forced a merger. In the 1980s, the oil and gas industry suffered a large economic downturn. This severely affected the regional economy, and many companies cut back jobs or went out of business, including a large retail shopping mall (South Park Mall) which closed in the late 1990s. The mall's major facilities were later adapted for use by Summer Grove Baptist Church. Shreveport's economy entered a major economic recession, and many residents left the area.

At one time, Shreveport was home to numerous manufacturers, including [[Shreveport Operations]], a [[General Motors]] plant that permanently closed in August 2012. The plant produced the [[Chevrolet Colorado]], [[GMC Canyon]], Hummer H3 series, and the [[Isuzu i-Series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20120828/AUTO0103/208280442 |title=GM's Shreveport Plant Closes |date=August 28, 2012 |work=Detroit News |access-date=September 5, 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref> In January 2013, the plant was leased from Caddo Parish by [[Elio Motors]].<ref name="Klayman">{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-trust-formergmplant-idUSBRE9020M420130103| title=Maker of high-mileage 3-wheel vehicles leases former GM plant| last=Klayman| first=Ben| date=January 3, 2013| work=[[Reuters]]| publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]]| access-date=January 3, 2013| location=Detroit| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104014805/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/03/us-trust-formergmplant-idUSBRE9020M420130103| archive-date=January 4, 2013| url-status=live}}</ref>  However, Elio Motors never went into production at the Shreveport plant.

In addition to GM, other notable large companies that have had or still have Shreveport manufacturing/assembly or production facilities or operations include: [[General Electric]] (electric transformer production), [[Western Electric]] (payphone manufacturing, approximately 7,500 employees at its peak, changed ownership through the years but closed in 2001)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ktbs.com/news/former-avaya-att-facility-gets-new-life-as-mansfield-warehouse/article_0ecc9706-b9d5-11e7-887f-338fd6d3076e.html|title=Former Avaya/ATT facility gets new life as Mansfield Warehouse, welcomes new tenant|website=KTBS|date=October 25, 2017 |access-date=October 7, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026052634/https://www.ktbs.com/news/former-avaya-att-facility-gets-new-life-as-mansfield-warehouse/article_0ecc9706-b9d5-11e7-887f-338fd6d3076e.html|archive-date=October 26, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref> [[UOP LLC|Honeywell UOP]], [[Libbey-Owens-Ford]], [[Poulan|Beaird-Poulan]] (the originator of and, for decades, the only manufacturer of the single-operator [[chainsaw]] in the world),<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.poulanpro.com/us/support/company-history/|title=Company History|website=Poulan Pro}}</ref> [[Calumet Specialty Products Partners]] (originally [[United Gas Corporation]]'s Atlas Processing Unit and then [[Pennzoil]]), and Frymaster, LLC (a subsidiary of [[The Manitowoc Company]]). Today, only Calumet Packaging and Honeywell UOP survive as a large manufacturing employer in Shreveport.

By 2017, manufacturing and other goods-producing (e.g. petrochemical refining) jobs accounted for just 5% of Shreveport occupations, compared to 8% for the nationwide percentage of the workforce involved in manufacturing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bestplaces.net/economy/city/louisiana/shreveport|title=Shreveport, Louisiana Economy|website=Bestplaces.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181006000616/https://www.bestplaces.net/economy/city/louisiana/shreveport|archive-date=October 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm|title=Employment by major industry sector : U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|website=Bls.gov|access-date=October 10, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181011003632/https://www.bls.gov/emp/tables/employment-by-major-industry-sector.htm|archive-date=October 11, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Shreveport has since largely transitioned to a service economy. In particular, there has been rapid growth in the gaming industry. The city hosts various riverboat gambling [[casino]]s, and, before [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, was second only to [[New Orleans]] in Louisiana tourism. Nearby [[Bossier City]] is home to one of the three horse racetracks in the state, [[Louisiana Downs]]. Casinos in Shreveport-Bossier include [[Sam's Town Hotel and Gambling Hall, Shreveport|Sam's Town]], [[Bally's Shreveport|Bally's]], [[Horseshoe Bossier City|Horseshoe]], [[Boomtown Bossier City|Boomtown]], and [[Margaritaville Resort Casino|Margaritaville]]. Diamond Jacks Casino (formerly Isle of Capri) closed in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Bossier City casino, hotel closes doors permanently|url=https://www.ktbs.com/news/bossier-city-casino-hotel-closes-doors-permanently/article_3ce5639e-96d6-11ea-8684-1bafc9356d9c.html|website=KTBS|date=May 15, 2020 |language=en|access-date=May 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Bossier City loses $1.5 million in tax revenue due to DiamondJacks Casino closing|url=https://www.ksla.com/2020/05/15/bossier-city-loses-million-tax-revenue-due-diamondjacks-casino-closing/|website=KSLA 12|date=May 16, 2020 |language=en-US|access-date=May 16, 2020}}</ref> The Shreveport-Bossier Convention and Tourist Bureau is the official tourism information agency for the region. The bureau maintains a comprehensive database of restaurants, accommodations, attractions, and events.

In May 2005, the [[Louisiana Boardwalk]], a {{convert|550000|sqft|adj=on}} shopping and entertainment complex, opened in Bossier City across from Shreveport's downtown. It features outlet shopping, several restaurants, a 14‑screen movie theater, a bowling complex, and [[Bass Pro Shops]].

A {{convert|350000|sqft|adj=on}} convention center was completed in the Shreveport Downtown Riverfront. Managed by [[SMG (property management)|SMG]], it includes an 800-space parking garage. An adjoining Hilton Hotel opened in June 2007. It was constructed by and owned by the city, which has been a controversial issue, and the subject of discussions about use of public funds.

In November 2008, development of the [[Haynesville Shale]] area, with new jobs in the natural gas industry were expected to be created over the next few years. Residents in the region have been given large bonuses for signing mineral rights leases up to $25,000 per acre. However, economic downturn had resulted in a lower market price for natural gas and slower-than-expected drilling activity. The city expected to generate revenue by leasing the mineral rights on public lands in the near future as neighboring municipalities had already done. However with advances in fracking methods in the Haynesville shale and starting in 2022 with the increase of natural gas prices after Covid to as high as $8/Mcf (thousand cubic feet), rig activity has greatly increased in the Haynesville to be the 2nd largest basin in the United States by number of active drilling rigs (2nd only to the Permian Basin - largest basin in the United States). It has since slowed to a degree since natural gas prices have decreased but is still the 3rd highest ranked basin in the US in terms of number of active drilling rigs.

Gambling and hotel industries in Shreveport, [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Capital One]], and [[Regions Financial Corporation]] have regional offices in Shreveport's downtown and surrounding districts and neighborhoods. AT&T's regional headquarters is located in Downtown Shreveport.

====Mardi Gras====
[[Mardi Gras]] celebrations in Shreveport date to the mid‑19th century when [[krewe]]s and parades were organized along the lines of those of New Orleans. Mardi Gras in Shreveport did not survive the cancellations caused by [[World War I]]. Attempts to revive it in the 1920s were unsuccessful, and the last Carnival celebrations in Shreveport for decades were held in 1927. Mardi Gras in Shreveport was revived beginning in 1984 with the organization of the Krewe of Apollo. The Krewes of Gemini, Centaur, Aesclepius, Highland, Sobek, Harambee, and others, followed during the next decade and a half. The first krewe{{clarify|date=January 2017}} to revive parading was Gemini in 1989. Today, Mardi Gras is again an important part of the cultural life of the Shreveport-Bossier metropolitan area.<ref>Brock, Eric J.: "Mardi Gras Grows, But Fizzled Earlier," ''The Times''.

Its headquarters is in Shreveport's downtown near [[Interstate 20]]. The newspaper's former rival, the afternoon ''[[Shreveport Journal]]'', ceased publication in 1991. Other major newspapers include ''[[The Shreveport Sun]]'', ''Caddo Citizen'', and ''SB Magazine''. ''The Shreveport Sun'' is the area's primary [[African-American newspapers|African American newspaper]].<ref>{{Cite news|website=Library of Congress |title=The Shreveport Sun|url=https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83045388/|access-date=August 29, 2020}}</ref>

====Highways and roads====
[[File:Shreveport September 2015 071 (Texas Street).jpg|thumb|Texas Street]]
[[File:Shreveport September 2015 087 (Texas Avenue).jpg|thumb|Texas Avenue]]
Shreveport's past reflects the need for mass transit and public roads. As far back as the 1870s, residents used [[mule]]-[[Horsecar|drawn street cars]] that were converted to electric motorized cars by 1890. [[Commuter rail]] systems in Shreveport flourished for many decades, and rail car lines extended out to rural areas. In 1930 trolleys and rail cars began to be replaced by buses, although motor buses did not finally replace all trolley service until the 1960s. In the 1960s, the [[Interstate Highway System]] came to the area with the construction of [[Interstate 20 in Louisiana|Interstate 20]].

The local public transportation provider, [[SporTran]], provides moderately extensive bus service throughout Shreveport and Bossier City. Sportran operates seven days a week on seventeen bus routes (five night routes) from 6:00 a.m. to 1:00 am, with no night service on Sunday. The highway system has a cross-hair and loop freeway structure similar to that of [[Texas]] cities like [[Houston]] and [[Dallas]]. The loop consists of the Outer Loop Freeway [[Interstate 220 (Louisiana)|Interstate 220]] on the north and the Inner Loop Freeway, [[Louisiana Highway 3132]], on the south, forming approximately an {{convert|8|mi|km|0|adj=mid|-diameter}} semi-loop around downtown. Another loop is formed by the Bert Kouns Industrial Loop (Louisiana Highway 526) and circles further south, bisecting [[Interstate 49 in Louisiana|Interstate 49]]. I-49 now extends north to [[Interstate 30]] in [[Arkansas]], though there is a gap in I-49 within Shreveport.

Shreveport lies along the route of the proposed [[Interstate 69 in Louisiana|Interstate 69]] [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) superhighway that will link Canada, the U.S. industrial [[Midwest]], Texas, and [[Mexico]].

====Airports====
Shreveport is served by two airports. The larger is [[Shreveport Regional Airport]] (SHV), established in 1952, and is served by [[Allegiant Air]], [[American Airlines]], [[Delta Air Lines]], and [[United Airlines]] (as United Express). The smaller airport, [[Shreveport Downtown Airport]] (DTN), was built in 1931 and is located north of the Downtown Business District along the Red River. It is currently a general aviation and reliever airport, but was originally Shreveport's commercial airport.

====Railroads====
The Shreveport Waterworks Museum contains the Shreveport Railroad Museum, commemorating area railroad history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://shreveportwaterworks.org/railroad-museum/|title=Railroad Museum – Shreveport Water Works Museum – McNeil Street Pumping Station|website=shreveportwaterworks.org|access-date=July 3, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703220332/http://shreveportwaterworks.org/railroad-museum/|archive-date=July 3, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city had been served until the 1960s by several passenger railroads, at different stations.

*[[Shreveport Central Railroad Station|Central Station]] at 1025 Marshall Street served the [[Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad]]

===Military installations===
[[File:Barksdale entrance IMG 1370.JPG|thumb|Entrance to Barksdale AFB]]
[[Barksdale Air Force Base]] is located in [[Bossier Parish]] across the river from Shreveport, which annexed and donated the land for its construction in the 1920s. Named for pioneer army aviator Lt. [[Eugene Hoy Barksdale]] and originally called Barksdale Army Air Field, it opened in 1933 and became Barksdale Air Force Base in 1947. Headquartered here are the [[Air Force Global Strike Command]], 8th Air Force, 2d Bomb Wing, and 307th Wing. The primary aircraft housed here is the Boeing [[B-52 Stratofortress]]. In earlier years, the base was the home to other famous aircraft, including the [[B-47 Stratojet]].

Shreveport is home to the two [[108th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|108th Cavalry]] Squadrons, the reconnaissance element of the [[256th Infantry Brigade]]. Three of the squadron's four cavalry troops are located at 400 East Stoner Avenue in a historic armory known as "Fort Humbug". It got the name due to the Confederate Army burning logs to look like cannons and placing them along the Red River. This caused Union ironclad ships sailing north on the Red River to be tricked into turning back south.<ref>Brock, Eric J.: ''Eric Brock's Shreveport''. Gretna: Pelican Publishing Co., 2001</ref>
