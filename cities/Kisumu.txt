It is the second-largest city after [[Kampala]] in the [[Lake Victoria]] Basin. The city has a population of slightly over 600,000. The metro region, including Maseno and Ahero, has a population of  1,155,574 people (560,942 males, 594,609 females and 23 intersex) according to the 2019 Kenya Population and Housing Census which was conducted by the [[Kenya National Bureau of Statistics]]. 

Apart from being an important political city, it is one of the premier industrial and commercial centres in Kenya. It is also an intellectual city with many PhDs per capita. The city is currently{{when|date=October 2022}} undergoing an urban rejuvenation of the downtown and lower town which includes modernizing the lake front, decongesting main streets, and making the streets pedestrian-friendly.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Nyong'o lauds Uhuru for initiating projects in Kisumu|url=https://www.the-star.co.ke/counties/nyanza/2020-10-24-nyongo-lauds-uhuru-for-initiating-projects-in-kisumu/|access-date=2021-05-24|website=The Star|language=en-KE}}</ref>

Culturally, Kisumu serves as the centre of the [[Luo people]] of [[East Africa]]. It was the most prominent urban centre in the pre-colonial, post-colonial, and modern eras for natives of the [[Kavirondo]] region. It was briefly renamed '''Port Florence''', before its name was reverted back.

The city serves as the [[capital city|capital]] of [[Kisumu County]] and was the immediate former capital of now-defunct [[Nyanza Province]]. 
It is an important link in the [[trade route]] between [[Lake Victoria]] and [[Mombasa]] because of its water and rail connections. It is also the chief terminus for the agricultural produce of Nyanza and Western regions.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kisumu |title=Kisumu {{!}} Kenya |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |language=en |access-date=2019-11-14 |archive-date=16 November 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116190003/https://www.britannica.com/place/Kisumu |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Kisumu International Airport]] has regular flights to Nairobi and other neighbouring cities such as [[Mombasa]].

==Etymology==
When Europeans first settled in the area in the late 19th century, Kisumu became a trading post – attracting [[Luo people]] from as far as [[Migori]] and [[Siaya|Siaya County]]. The Kisumu region was then occupied by the Luo community. A person going to Kisumu at that time would say, "Adhi Kisuma" to mean I'm going to trade. Derived from the word "Kisuma", the word for a trading post in Luo is "Kisumo", and in [[Dholuo|Nandi]], "Kesumett". The current name ''Kisumu'' is an English corruption of the word "Kisumo" or "Kesumett".

An opposing theory states that Kisumu acquired its name from 'Kusuma', the [[Logooli language|Maragoli]] word for 'trading'. Because, before Luo arrived in the area, the Maragoli were already trading with other people in the area like the [[Nandi people|Nandi]] and the Maasai. Some Luo words were acquired from the Maragoli.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

==History==
[[File: Smithsonian Institution Archives - 1661 Image RU7179 Box6 Hellers-11.jpg|thumb|Local inhabitants near Kisumu, 1911]]

Kisumu City is believed to be one of the oldest settlements in Kenya with historical records indicating that Kisumu was dominated by diverse communities at different times long before Europeans
arrived. The people from the Nandi, [[Kalenjin people|Kalenjin]], [[Kisii people|Kisii]], [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Luo people of Kenya and Tanzania|Luo]] and [[Luhya people|Luhya]] communities converged at the tip of Lake Victoria and called the place "sumo" which literally means ''a place of barter trade''. Each community called it different names, for instance:
# The Luo called it "Kisumo" meaning "a place to look for food" such that the Luo would say "I am going Kisuma" to mean "I am going to look for food".
# The [[Luhya people|Abaluhya]] called it "Abhasuma" which means "a place to borrow food", such that the Luhya would say "I am going Khusuma" to mean "I am going to borrow food".
# The [[Kisii people|Abagusii]] called it "egesumu" meaning "a structure for keeping/rearing chicken". It is believed the Abagusii were in Kisumu but found Kisumu was not good for crop husbandry and agriculture.
# The Nandi called it "Kisumett" which means a place where food was found during times of scarcity and exchange, which cannot be attacked by Nandi and Terik irrespective of any issue.<ref>http://www.kisumucbda.or.ke {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201210606/http://kisumucbda.or.ke/ |date=1 February 2015 }}</ref>
#Industries are centred on processing agricultural products, brewing, and textile manufacturing. Asians once constituted more than one-fourth of the population, but declined after independence in 1963.

Kisumu was identified by the British explorers in early 1898 as an alternative railway terminus and port for the [[Uganda Railway]], then under construction. It was to replace [[Port Victoria, Kenya|Port Victoria]], then an important centre on the caravan trade route, near the delta of the [[Nzoia River]]. Kisumu was ideally located on the shores of [[Lake Victoria]] at the cusp of the [[Winam Gulf]], at the end of the caravan trail from [[Pemba, Mozambique|Pemba]], Mombasa, and [[Malindi]] and had the potential for connections to the whole of the Lake region via steam ships. In July 1899, the first skeleton plan for Kisumu was prepared. This included landing places and wharves along the northern lakeshore, near the present-day Airport Road. Demarcations for government buildings and retail shops were also included in the plan.<ref name="issuu2009">{{cite web |url= http://issuu.com/svengvp/docs/bestofkenya/3?mode=a_p |title=The Best of Kenya |author = Sven Boermeester |publisher=Issuu.com|year= 2009|access-date=10 December 2013}}</ref>

Another plan was later prepared in May 1900, when plots were allocated to a few European firms as well as to Indian traders who had travelled to Kisumu on contracts to build the Uganda Railway and had decided to settle at the expanding terminus. A later plan included a flying boat jetty (now used by the Fisheries Department). In October 1900, the 62-ton ship [[SS William Mackinnon]] was reassembled and registered in Kisumu, and made its maiden voyage to [[Entebbe]], marking the beginning of the Lake Marine Services. The [[SS Winifred (1901)]] and the [[SS Sybil (1901)]] were later added to the fleet in 1902 and 1904, respectively. On Friday, 20 December 1901, the railway line reached the Kisumu pier, adopting a new name, Port Florence.

By February 1903, the railway line had been opened for goods and passenger transportation.<ref>{{Cite web |title=About Us |url=https://city.kisumu.go.ke/about-us/ |access-date=2023-06-07 |website=City of Kisumu |language=en-US}}</ref> Kisumu was also privileged to host the first flight in Kenya; the current police workshop was the first hangar in [[Kenya]]. Before the jet airline era, the city was a landing point on the British flying boat passenger and mail route from [[Southampton]] to [[Cape Town]]. Kisumu also linked [[Port Bell]] to Nairobi.<ref name="autogenerated61">{{Cite book| last = Anyumba| first = Godfrey| title = Kisumu town: History of the built form, planning and environment ( Housing and Urban Policy Studies)| publisher = [[Delft University Press]]| location = Netherlands| date = 1890–1990| pages = 61–70| isbn = 90-407-1067-8}}</ref>
In the meantime, it was realised that the site originally chosen for the township north of the Nyanza Gulf was unsuitable for the town's expansion, due to its flat topography and poor soils. An alternative site was therefore identified and the town's location moved to the ridge on the southern shore of the Gulf, where the town is today. Consequently, another plan was prepared in 1902, which provided the basic layout of the new town on the southern ridge. This was followed by the construction of a number of government buildings, notably the former Provincial Commissioner's Office (now State Lodge) and the Old Prison (now earmarked for the construction of an [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] cathedral).<ref name="issuu2009"/>

In 1903, the township boundaries were gazetted and some {{cvt|12000|acres|disp=flip}}, including water, set aside for its development. The new township reverted to its original name, Kisumu, in substitution for Port Florence. At this time, there was an 'Old Kisumu' that consisted of two rows of stalls (Dukas) on Mumias Road, north of the Gulf. It was demolished in the twenties when new plots became available on Odera and Ogada Streets in the present-day Kisumu, hence the new area acquired the name 'New Bazaar'. [[Winston Churchill]] visited Kisumu in 1907.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kisumu County – Kisumu|url=https://www.kisumu.go.ke/|language=en|access-date=2020-05-18|archive-date=16 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116185947/https://www.kisumu.go.ke/|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=History & Culture|url=https://westernkenya.org/info/kisumu/history-culture/|website=WEstern Kenya|language=en-US|access-date=2020-05-25|archive-date=16 November 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116190033/https://westernkenya.org/info/kisumu/history-culture/|url-status=live}}</ref>

By the 1930s and 40s, the city had become a leading centre for commerce, administrative and military installations. In the 1960s the population of Asians in relation to locals was significantly higher. The town was elevated to the status of a municipal board in 1940 and later to a municipal council in 1960. In the early sixties, very little development took place in Kisumu, with an acute shortage in housing, shops and offices. The situation was made worse by the influx of locals into the town following the declaration of independence in 1963.<ref name="autogenerated61"/>

The city's growth and prosperity slowed down temporarily in 1977, as a result of the collapse of the [[East African Community]]. However, the city spurred with the reformation of the community in 1996 and with its designation as a "city". The port has been stimulated by the transformation of international business and trade, as well as the shipments of goods destined for Uganda, [[Tanzania]], [[Burundi]], [[Rwanda]] and the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]].

Currently, Kisumu is one of the fastest-growing cities in Kenya. It is thriving with the sugar and rice irrigation industries, whose contribution to the national economy is immense due to its natural resources and as the epicentre for business in Kenya.

==Agriculture==
Kisumu has highly fertile land and variations in temperature and rainfall with two rainy seasons per year across the region provide a suitable environment for a broad range of agricultural crops. The Kisumu region has approximately 1.6 million hectares of agricultural land. However, it is estimated that only 58 percent of the land is currently used. The majority of farming in the lake basin region is [[subsistence agriculture]], leading to relatively low production volumes. Current crop yields are considered to be significantly lower than the potential afforded by soil and climate conditions. Current low land utilisation and yields are driven by the lack of guaranteed markets and associated support services. Like agriculture, livestock farming is currently performed primarily on a subsistence basis. Cattle are predominantly indigenous breeds with lower milk output than grade cattle.

===Aquaculture===
The Kenyan part of Lake Victoria covers approximately 400000 hectares (4,100 square kilometres), with {{convert|550|km|0}} of lake shoreline; most of this shoreline is under-used.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Kisumu Kenya Potential Opportunities for Investors 2008 - [PDF Document]|url=https://fdocuments.net/document/kisumu-kenya-potential-opportunities-for-investors-2008.html|website=fdocuments.net|language=en|access-date=2020-05-25}}</ref>
