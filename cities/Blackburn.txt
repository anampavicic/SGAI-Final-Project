A former [[mill town]], textiles have been produced in Blackburn since the middle of the 13th century, when wool was woven in people's houses in the [[domestic system]]. [[Flemish people|Flemish]] weavers who settled in the area in the 14th&nbsp;century helped to develop the woollen cottage industry.<ref name="hb flemish weavers">Burrow, J. & Co. (Eds.) (1960), p. 8.</ref> The most rapid period of growth and development in Blackburn's history coincided with the industrialisation and expansion of [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile manufacturing]].

Blackburn's textile sector fell into decline from the mid-20th century and subsequently faced similar challenges to other [[Post-industrial society|post-industrial]] [[Northern England|northern]] towns, including deindustrialisation, economic deprivation and housing problems. Blackburn has had significant investment and redevelopment since 1958 through government funding and the [[European Regional Development Fund]].<ref>[http://www.blackburn.gov.uk/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.4485 European regional development funding] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011072527/http://www.blackburn.gov.uk/server.php?show=ConWebDoc.4485 |date=11 October 2007}}, [[Blackburn with Darwen Council]], Retrieved 17 April 2014</ref>

===Toponymy===
[[File:BlackburnClockTower1906.jpg|thumb|upright|Blackburn's old clock tower in 1906 with [[time ball]] at the top of its mast]]
The origins of the name are uncertain. It has been suggested that it may be a combination of the River [[River Blakewater, Lancashire|Blakewater]], and an [[Old English]] word "burn", meaning stream.  Local author William Abram, in his 1877 history of the town and parish, cited the ancient name as ''Blake Burne''. Abram also confirms that the region, later known as the [[Blackburn Hundred]], was known as ''Blakeburneshyre''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Abram |first= William Alexander |title=Parish of Blackburn, County of Lancaster: A History of Blackburn, Town and Parish |url=https://archive.org/details/parishofblackbur00abrarich |year=1877 |location=Blackburn |publisher=J.

===Prehistory===
There is little evidence of prehistoric settlement in the [[River Blakewater, Lancashire|Blakewater]] valley, in which Blackburn developed. Evidence of activity in the form of two urn burials has been discovered from the [[British Bronze Age|Bronze Age]] in the hills around Blackburn. In 1879, a [[cinerary urn]] was discovered at a [[tumulus]] at Revidge, north of the town; another was excavated in 1996 at Pleasington Cemetery, west of the town, by gravedigger Grant Higson.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/6208899.Rare_treasure_found/ |title=Rare Treasure Found |date=27 March 1996 |access-date=6 June 2017 |work=[[Lancashire Evening Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Newsquest Media Group]] }}</ref> The presence of a [[Holy well|sacred spring]]—perhaps in use during the [[British Iron Age|Iron Age]]—provides evidence of prehistoric activity in the town centre, at All Hallows Spring on Railway Road.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/environment/archaeologyandheritage/historictowns/BlackburnToFig4_LowRes.pdf |title=Lancashire Historic Town Survey: Blackburn: Historic Town Assessment Report |publisher=[[Lancashire County Council]] |date=April 2005 |access-date=3 March 2008 |page=16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228035116/http://www.lancashire.gov.uk/environment/archaeologyandheritage/historictowns/BlackburnToFig4_LowRes.pdf |archive-date=28 February 2008}}</ref>

===Roman era===
Blackburn is located where a [[Roman road|Roman military road]] crossed the river Blakewater. The road linked [[Bremetennacum|Bremetennacum Veteranorum]] ([[Ribchester]]) and [[Mamucium]] (a major Roman [[Fortification|fort]] that occupied [[Castlefield]] in Manchester). The route of the road passed east of [[Blackburn Cathedral]] and probably crossed the river in the Salford neighbourhood just east of the modern town centre.{{refn|Not to be confused with [[City of Salford|Salford]] in Greater Manchester.|group=n}} It is not clear whether the road predated the settlement.<ref name="Beattie 1992, p. 11" /><ref name="Lancashire County Council 2005 p. 16">Lancashire County Council (2005), ''Lancashire Historic Town Survey: Blackburn'', p. 16.</ref>

George C. Miller, in his ''Blackburn: The Evolution of a Cotton Town'', says:

<blockquote>The ancient military way from [[Mamucium]] (Manchester) to ([[Bremetennacum]]) (Ribchester), passing over Blacksnape, plunges on its unswerving course through Blackamoor, over the scarp at Whinney Heights, to pass across the Blakewater in the vicinity of Salford. This fact alone presents a reasonable argument for the existence of a British oppidum or walled village on the site, it being customary for such primitive communities to cluster in the vicinity of a ford or bridge.<ref>Miller [1952](1992), p. 4.</ref></blockquote>

According to William Abram (1877):

<blockquote>The Parish of Blackburn contains many interesting vestiges. Three of the four principal roads constructed by the Romans in Lancashire traversed some portion of the Parish : —I. The lower road from the south to Carlisle, intersected the township of Walton-in-le-Dale. 2. The road from Manchester to Overborough crossed the Parish at its broadest part. 3. The road from the sea to the interior, which formed the conmiunication between the "Sistuntian Port" (on the Wyre) and Ribchester, Ilkley-in-Wharfedale, Aldborough andYork, enters Blackburn Parish at Ribchester, by a ford over the Ribble. The late Rev. E. Sibson, in a paper on the Roman Roads of the Wigan district, speaks of a road of this kind which branched off eastward from Blackrod, "Street-fold and Water-street, near Rivington, and by White Hough, in Tockholes, to the small Roman station at Blackburn, near the new road to Preston."<ref>{{cite book |last=Abram |first= William Alexander |title= Parish of Blackburn, County of Lancaster: A History of Blackburn, Town and Parish |url=https://archive.org/details/parishofblackbur00abrarich |year=1877 |location=Blackburn |publisher=J.

During the 12th&nbsp;century, the town's importance declined as [[Clitheroe]] became the regional centre.<ref name="Lancashire County Council 2005 p. 17"/> In addition to a settlement in the town centre area, there were several other medieval domiciles nearby.

===Industrial Revolution and textiles===

Rowland Baguley and Company, based on Addison Street, produced a wide range of shuttles for the home textile industry and for export before it closed in the early 1930s.]]

Textile manufacturing in Blackburn dates from the mid-13th&nbsp;century, when wool produced locally by farmers was woven in their homes. Flemish weavers who settled in the area in the 14th century developed the industry. By 1650 the town was known for the manufacture of blue and white "Blackburn checks", and "Blackburn greys" became famous not long afterwards.<ref name="hb flemish weavers"/> By the first half of the 18th century [[textile industry|textile manufacture]] had become Blackburn's main industry.<ref>Beattie (1992), p.13.</ref> From the mid-18th to the early 20th&nbsp;century Blackburn evolved from a small market town into "the weaving capital of the world", and its population increased from less than 5,000 to over 130,000.<ref>Beattie (1992), p.&nbsp;49.</ref>

''John Bartholomew's Gazetteer of the British Isles'' provides a profile of Blackburn in 1887:

<blockquote>Blackburn. [[borough status in the United Kingdom|parl. and mun. bor.]], [[ecclesiastical parish|parish]] and [[Township (England)|township]], NE. Lancashire, {{convert|9|mi|km|disp=sqbr}} E. of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and {{convert|210|mi|km|disp=sqbr}} NW. of London by rail – par., 48,281 ac., pop. 161,617; township, 3681 ac., pop. 91,958; bor., 6974 ac., pop. 104,014; 4 Banks, 2 newspapers. Market-days, Wednesday and Saturday. It is one of the chief seats of cotton manufacture, besides producing [[Calico (fabric)|calico]], [[muslin]], &c., there being over 140&nbsp;mills at work. There are also factories for making cotton machinery and [[steam engine|steam-engines]]. Blackburn has been associated with many improvements in the manufacture of cotton, among which was the invention (1767) of the "[[spinning jenny]]" which was invented in nearby [[Oswaldtwistle]] by [[James Hargreaves]], who died in 1770. There are several fine churches and public buildings. A [[Corporation Park, Blackburn|Corporation Park]] (50 [[acre|ac.]] in area) is on the outskirts of the town. Several lines of railway converge here, and pass through one principal station belonging to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Ry. Co. B. returns 2&nbsp;members to Parliament.<ref>[http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/descriptions/entry_page.jsp?text_id=1869320&word=NULL Vision of Britain: Bartholomew Gazetteer Entry for Blackburn], ''A Vision of Britain through Time'', Retrieved 21 April 2008.</ref></blockquote>
[[File:Weaving shed, Queen Street Mill - geograph.org.uk - 680867.jpg|thumb|A typical [[weaving shed]] at [[Queen Street Mill]] Textile Museum, Burnley]]
From around 1750, cotton textile manufacturing expanded rapidly. Supplied with cotton by merchants, and paid by the piece, cottagers spun cotton into thread and wove it into cloth. The merchants arranged for cloth to be bleached and dyed.

After 1775, [[Cotton mill|spinning]] mills were built in the town. Early mills were warehouse conversions; the first purpose-built spinning mill was constructed in 1797 and by 1824 there were 24. The number of [[Spindle (textiles)|spindles]] reached 2.5&nbsp;million&nbsp; by 1870 and spinning mills were constructed up to that time – 24 since 1850. Spinning declined between 1870 and 1900 as the sector transferred to south Lancashire.<ref>Beattie (1992), pp. 15–16.</ref>

In 18th-century Blackburn, [[weaving]] was primarily undertaken by [[loom|handloom]] weavers working from their own cottages. However, as powerlooms were introduced into the mills after 1825, the percentage of handloom weavers began to decline and this occurred more rapidly in areas closer to the town. In 1826 the [[Power-loom riots]] cam through Blackburn in response to the loss of jobs and low wages. Handloom weavers continued to make up a sizable portion of the workforce in outlying rural areas. The last handloom shop in Blackburn closed in 1894.<ref>Beattie (1992), pp. 16–18.</ref>

===1800s===
In 1807, the [[Thwaites Brewery|Daniel Thwaites & Co]] brewery was established; the company is still in business today and is now based at Sykes Holt in Mellor.<ref name="Daniel Thwaites Location">{{Cite web |title=Daniel Thwaites Location |url=https://www.thwaites.co.uk/brewery-and-our-beers/ |website=Thwaites.com |publisher=Thwaites |access-date=17 February 2018}}</ref>

Improvements to the [[power loom]] in the early 1840s, and the construction of a railway line in 1846, led to greater investment in power looms in Blackburn in the second half of that decade. The railway brought opportunities for expansion of the cotton trade, and in subsequent decades many new mills were constructed:<ref>Timmins (1993).</ref> between 1850 and 1870, sixty-eight&nbsp;weaving-only and four combined weaving/spinning mills were built and nine weaving mills were built per decade between 1870 and 1890.<ref>Beattie (1992), p. 17.</ref>
[[File:Mill Chimney, Blackburn, UK.jpg|thumb|upright|Duke Street Mill being destroyed]]

Improvements in power loom efficiency meant that weaving, the primary source of wealth and income for handloom weavers, began to transfer from the cottage industry to factories.<ref>Turner (1992), p. 9.</ref> This led to high rates of unemployment: according to figures published in March 1826, some 60 per cent of all handloom weavers in Blackburn and [[Rishton]], [[Lower Darwen]] and [[Oswaldtwistle]] were unemployed.<ref>Turner (1992), p.&nbsp;12.</ref> High unemployment led to the [[Power-loom riots|Lancashire weavers' riots]]. At 3:00 pm on 24 April 1826, a mob arrived in Blackburn after attacking power looms in [[Accrington]]. Proceeding to Bannister Eccles' Jubilee Factory on Jubilee Street, the mob destroyed 212 power looms in the space of 35 minutes. They then turned their attention to John Houghton and Sons' Park Place factory, located nearby, and destroyed another 25 looms, before seeking more machinery to attack. The crowd began to disperse at around 6:00 pm, troops having arrived at 3:30 pm to try to quell the rioting.<ref>Turner (1992), pp. 18–24.</ref>

===20th-century decline of the cotton industry===
In 1890, Blackburn's [[Chamber of Commerce]] had recognised that the town was overly dependent on the cotton industry, warning of the dangers of "only having one string to their bow in Blackburn".<ref>Taylor (2000), p. 11.</ref> The warning proved prophetic when, in 1904, a slump hit the cotton industry and other industries dependent on it, such as engineering, brewing and building.<ref>Taylor (2000), p. 18.</ref> In 1908, another slump saw 43 mills stop production and a quarter of the town's looms lay idle.<ref>Taylor (2000), p. 24.</ref> 
[[File:Albion Mill Blackburn.jpg |thumb|Albion Mill photographed in 2008. The mill ceased production in 1975 and was demolished in 2010.<ref name="Taylor A">Taylor (2000), pp. 109–110.</ref>]]

During the [[First World War]] suspension of trade with India resulted in the expansion of colonial British India's cotton industry at the expense of Britain's,<ref name="ATaylor 1">Taylor (2000), pp. 47–55.</ref> and the imposition of an 11 per cent import tariff by the colonial British Government led to a dramatic slump in trade in 1921, a situation which worsened in 1922 after the Indian Government raised the tariff to 14 per cent. This caused the number of stopped mills to increase to 47, with 43,000 looms lying idle.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=1678&language=eng |title=Indian Duties |work=Cotton Town |publisher=Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council |access-date=19 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026021011/http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=1678&language=eng |archive-date=26 October 2007}}</ref> Two years into the slump, Foundry and Limbrick Mills became the first to close permanently.<ref name="ATaylor 1"/>

Not long afterwards, in 1926, the [[1926 United Kingdom general strike|General Strike]] saw production suspended at half the town's mills and 12,000&nbsp;unemployed.<ref name="ATaylor 1"/>

In 1927, [[Matthew Brown & Co.]] relocated to the town's Lion Brewery, on Coniston Road, following their acquisition of local brewer Nuttall & Co, later the subject of a hostile takeover by [[Scottish & Newcastle|Scottish & Newcastle Breweries]] in 1987, ceasing brewing in 1991.{{citation needed|date=May 2020}}

In 1928, there was another slump in textile production, and another strike in 1929 after employers requested a 12%&nbsp;wage cut; 40,000&nbsp;cotton workers struck for a week and eight mills closed, making 28&nbsp;closures in six years.<ref name="ATaylor 1" /> By the start of 1930, 50&nbsp;mills had shut and 21,000&nbsp;people were unemployed.<ref name="ATaylor 1" /> A financial crisis in 1931 led to 24,000&nbsp;unemployed, with 1,000&nbsp;houses and 166&nbsp;shops lying empty in the town.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=1680&language=eng |title=Financial Crisis |access-date=19 May 2008 |work=Cotton Town |publisher=Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026185452/http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=1680&language=eng |archive-date=26 October 2007}}</ref> A total of 26 mills closed down between 1930 and 1934.<ref name="ATaylor 1"/>

====1948 mass fingerprinting====
Blackburn became the first town to undertake the mass fingerprinting of people following the murder of [[June Anne Devaney]] in May 1948.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The Fingerprint Society Commemorates 60 Years Since Landmark Fingerprint Identification |url=http://www.fpsociety.org.uk/news/JAD.html |publisher=The Fingerprint Society |access-date=12 September 2012 |year=2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306164019/http://www.fpsociety.org.uk/news/JAD.html |archive-date=6 March 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> June Anne Devaney was a three-year-old patient at Queens Park Hospital when she was abducted from her cot and murdered in the hospital grounds on 15 May 1948. Fingerprints on a bottle underneath her cot led the police to fingerprint every male over the age of 16 who was present in Blackburn on 14 and 15 May 1948. After taking over 46,500 sets of fingerprints, a match was made with Peter Griffiths, a 22-year-old ex-serviceman. Griffiths admitted his guilt and his trial ascertained if he was sane or not. After deliberating for 23 minutes, the jury found him sane and he was hanged at [[Liverpool Prison]] on Friday 19 November 1948. After his conviction, the police destroyed all fingerprints they had taken.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Sixty Years of Fingerprints |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/7573433.stm |publisher=BBC |access-date=12 September 2012 |format=Video |date=20 August 2008}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Woodruff |first=Lorna |title=The Murder of June Anne Devaney |url=http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=5144&language=eng |publisher=Cottontown.org |access-date=12 September 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404071143/http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?language=eng&pageID=5144 |archive-date=4 April 2012}}</ref>

Between 1948 and 1950 the textile industry experienced a short post-war boom, during which sales increased, industry training methods improved and automatic looms were introduced, which allowed a single weaver to control 20 to 25 looms.

==Governance==
{{about|section=y|the organisation of government in the area|party politics and local issues|#Politics}}
Blackburn is administered by [[Blackburn with Darwen]] [[unitary authority]], which encompasses Blackburn and the small town of [[Darwen]] to the south. The town sends one Member of Parliament (MP) to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].

===Local government===
{{Main|Blackburn with Darwen|Blackburn with Darwen local elections}}
The council has been elected "by thirds" since 1996{{refn |One councillor from each of the three-member wards is elected in each of three years of four; candidates in 2-member wards are elected in two years of four. In the other years of the four-year cycle no elections are required|group=n}} In its 2007 [[Comprehensive Performance Assessment]] (CPA), the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]] described the council as "improving well" and gave it the highest "four star" overall performance rating.<ref name="auditcomm">[http://cpa.audit-commission.gov.uk/STCCScorecard.aspx?TaxID=LG-LV-BLAWDBC Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council Comprehensive Performance Assessment (CPA) scorecard 2007] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707020027/http://cpa.audit-commission.gov.uk/STCCScorecard.aspx?TaxID=LG-LV-BLAWDBC |date=7 July 2011}}, [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]], Retrieved 5 July 2008.</ref>

Although children's services, adult social care and [[GCSE]] results were praised, the commission highlighted "significant health problems" and increased "levels of repeat victims of domestic violence" as causes for concern.<ref name="auditcomm"/> Despite generally good performance, overall user satisfaction levels with the council are below average and not improving.<ref name="auditcomm"/> The borough has [[Beacon Council (award)|Beacon Council]] status and shares its best practice in education policy with other councils as part of the scheme.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.blackburn.gov.uk |title=Home – Blackburn with Darwen Council |website=Blackburn.gov.uk}}</ref>

===Parliamentary representation===
The [[Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)|historic constituency of Blackburn]] was created for the [[1832 United Kingdom general election|1832 general election]] and sent two [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Members of Parliament]] (MPs) to Westminster until it was abolished in [[1950 United Kingdom general election|1950]] and replaced for one parliamentary term by two new single-member constituencies, [[Blackburn East (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackburn East]] and [[Blackburn West (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackburn West]]. At the [[1955 United Kingdom general election|1955 general election]], Blackburn East and Blackburn West were merged into the [[Blackburn (UK Parliament constituency)|modern-day constituency]] which is relatively tightly formed and returns a single [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MP]].

===Coat of arms===

The motto, granted on 14 February 1852 to the former Borough of Blackburn, is poignant, as Blackburn, once a small town, had risen to importance through the energy and enterprise of her spinners and manufacturers, combined with the skill and labour of her operatives.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Borough of Blackburn was formed by the amalgamation of the County Borough of Blackburn, the Borough of Darwen, part of the [[Turton Urban District]] and the parishes of [[Yate and Pickup Bank]], [[Eccleshill, Lancashire|Eccleshill]], [[Livesey]], [[Pleasington]] and [[Tockholes]] from the [[Blackburn Rural District]].<ref>{{Cite legislation UK |type=si |year=1972 |number=2039 |si=The English Non-metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972}}</ref>

==Politics==
{{Moresources|section|date=July 2023}}
Blackburn council and its successor have been predominantly controlled by the [[The Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] since 1945 and continuously for 19&nbsp;years until May 2007 when it fell into [[no overall control]].<ref>[http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/news/1375885.Shocked_Labour_loses_control_of_Blackburn_with_Darwen/ Shocked Labour loses control of Blackburn with Darwen], David Bartlett, ''[[Lancashire Telegraph]]'', 4 May 2007, Retrieved 6 June 2017.</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/uk_politics/vote2000/locals/10.stm |title=UK Politics: Local Elections 2000: Blackburn with Darwen |work=BBC News |access-date=4 July 2008}}</ref> In 2008, UKPollingReport characterised the constituency of Blackburn as "a mix of deprived inner-city wards dominated by Muslim voters, white working class areas and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] voting suburbs".<ref>[http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/seat-profiles/blackburn Blackburn Election Guide], UKPollingReport.

Until 2015, the MP was the former [[Secretary of State for Justice]] and former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[Jack Straw]]. The distribution of seats as of May 2018 was 44 seats for the Labour Party, 17 for the Conservatives and 3 for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]].

In July 1992, white and Asian youths rioted for several nights in Blackburn, with incidents taking place including an arson attack on a café which had allegedly been a meeting place for local Asians involved in organised crime.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/copycat-disorders-with-different-causes-as-rioters-clashed-with-police-on-the-streets-of-burnley-1535607.html|title = 'Copycat' disorders with different causes: As rioters clashed with|website = [[Independent.co.uk]]|date = 22 October 2011}}</ref>

The next resurgence of support for the far right came in 2002; The incumbent [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] were pushed into third place behind [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]. Commenting on the elections, Blackburn MP [[Jack Straw]] said: "It is very sad. We had the far right in Blackburn 26&nbsp;years ago when they won two seats in Shadsworth. But there the whole community decided they wouldn't have it. You can never say they won't put candidates in Blackburn but we will work hard on community relations."<ref>{{Cite news |title=BNP secures three seats |author=Higginson, David|publisher=[[Newsquest]] Media Group |date=27 November 2002}}</ref>

The council until prior to 2008 had two members for the [[England First]] party, [[Mark Cotterill]] for Meadowhead ward and Michael Johnson for Fernhurst. Mark Cotterill has since stood down and Michael Johnson joined the [[For Darwen]] party. Members of the [[British National Party|BNP]] won a council seat in the town in November 2002 following elections in May which saw three of their colleagues elected in nearby [[Burnley]]. The BNP's Robin Evans secured a 16-vote majority in Mill Hill ward with two recounts following a campaign using pub meetings and leafleting.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/farright/story/0,11981,845853,00.html |title=BNP snatches council seat in Straw constituency |author=Ward, David |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=23 November 2002 |access-date=5 July 2008 |location=London}}</ref> Robin Evans resigned from the party in October 2003.{{Why|date=July 2023}}<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1443668/BNP-councillor-resigns-from-party.html | title=BNP councillor resigns from party|website=Telegraph.co.uk| date=8 October 2003|accessdate=28 July 2023}}</ref>

The [[River Ribble|Ribble Valley]] and [[West Pennine Moors]] lie to the north and south respectively. Blackburn experiences a [[temperate]] [[Oceanic climate|maritime climate]], like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year.

Although the city of Preston, the administrative centre for Lancashire, is located about {{convert|9|mi|km|0|abbr=on}} west, Blackburn is the largest municipality in East Lancashire. The town is bounded on other sides by the towns of [[Accrington, Lancashire|Accrington]] to the east and Darwen to the south.

The [[River Blakewater]], which gives its names to the town, flows down from the moors above [[Guide, Lancashire|Guide]] and then through the areas of [[Whitebirk]], Little Harwood, Cob Wall and Brookhouse to the town centre. The river is [[culvert]]ed and runs underground in the town centre, under Ainsworth Street and between [[Blackburn Cathedral]] and the Boulevard. On the western side of the town centre the Blakewater continues through the Wensley Fold area before joining the [[River Darwen]] outside Witton Country Park; the Darwen flows into the [[River Ribble]] at [[Walton-le-Dale]].

The geology of the Blackburn area yields numerous resources which underpinned its development as a centre of manufacturing during the Industrial Revolution. [[mining|Mineable]] [[coal seam]]s have been used since the mid-late 16th&nbsp;century.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=1251&language=eng |title=Coal mining in Blackburn with Darwen |work=Cotton Town |publisher=Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council |access-date=27 October 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060617202021/http://cottontown.org/page.cfm?pageid=1251&language=eng |archive-date=17 June 2006}}</ref> 

The [[Coal Measures]] in the area overlie the [[Millstone Grit]] which has been [[quarry|quarried]] in the past for [[millstone]]s and, along with local [[limestone]] deposits, used as a construction material for roads and buildings.

===Green belt===
{{further|North West Green Belt}}
Blackburn is within a [[Green belt (United Kingdom)|green belt]] region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, and is in place to reduce [[urban sprawl]], prevent the towns in the nearby [[Greater Manchester Built-up Area|Greater Manchester]] and [[Liverpool Urban Area|Merseyside]] conurbations from further convergence, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage [[brownfield]] reuse, and preserve nearby countryside.

In 1975, documentary filmmaker [[Nick Broomfield]] and his wife Joan Churchill made ''[[Juvenile Liaison]]'' about a juvenile liaison project in the town. It examines a series of children and their run-ins with the law, over minor wrongdoings such as theft, truancy and abusive behaviour towards parents. After its production, the film was banned by the [[British Film Institute]] until 1990; ''Juvenile Liaison'' revolved mainly around the activities of Sergeant George Ray, whose preventive measures for dealing with young troublemakers fell mainly in the strong-arm category. In 1990, Broomfield and Churchill returned to Blackburn to film a follow-up. ''[[Juvenile Liaison 2]]'' revisits some of the residents from the first film, in an attempt to measure the success of the scheme.

The 1994 TV film ''[[Pat and Margaret]]'' starring [[Victoria Wood]] and [[Julie Walters]] was partly filmed in Blackburn.

===St Peter's Burial Ground===
During late 2015, work done on St Peter's Burial Ground in advance of road construction involved disinterring the remains of nearly 2,000 individuals buried there during the cemetery's period of operation (1821–1945). The burial ground had been connected with the former St Peter's Church, a large one that seated some 1,500 people, which was demolished in 1976. Archaeologists found that nearly half of the bodies were those of young children, who appeared to have died quickly during the mid-19th century from illnesses affected the lungs and gastrointestinal system. The numbers are taken as reflecting the massive increase in the city's population during that period due to its booming textile industry, which led to unhealthy living situations among the working classes.

The remains were to be relocated to another section of the cemetery. A memorial service conducted by [[Julian Henderson]], the [[Bishop of Blackburn]], for those being re-buried was scheduled to be held during the summer of 2016.<ref>{{cite news |title=Blackburn archaeological survey: Bodies of 800 young children found |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-lancashire-35408967 |work=BBC News |date=26 January 2016}}</ref>
