==History==
The city of Pocheon belonged to Mahan during the [[Samhan]] period and was part of Mahol during the [[Goguryeo]] period. After the Korean peninsula was unified by [[Silla]], it was called Gyeonseong-gun ({{lang|ko|堅城郡}}). As Silla was absorbed by the ruling dynasty, [[Goryeo]], the name was changed to Poju-gun ({{lang|ko|抱州郡}}) in 995, the 14th year of King Seongjeong's reign. During the King Hyeonjong's reign, the region belonged to Yangju-gun, Yanggwang-do. In the next ruling dynasty, Joseon, the region was named Pocheon-gun after the eight province system was established in 1413.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=182272&contentno=720702 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120730170227/http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=182272&contentno=720702 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-30 |script-title=ko:엔싸이버 백과검색 – 포천시의 연혁 |language=ko |publisher=Encyber.com |date=2007-08-13 |access-date=2010-02-19 }}</ref>

Pocheon has two main water sources; Yeongpyeongcheon stream and Sannaecheon stream. The tributaries of Yeongpyeongcheon stream are the Pocheoncheon stream running through Pocheon-dong and Seondan-dong areas and the Ildongcheon stream passing through Ildong-myeon. The two streams merge into Yeongpyeongcheon which passes Auraji Ferry in Sindap-ri, [[Yeoncheon]] county and finally ends up to reach [[Hantan River]]. The other main water source, Sannaecheonm, runs through Choseong-ri village, Yeoncheon county and also reaches Hantan River. The two stream areas are relatively wide, so that it enables for the residents to use as cultivation places and resident places.<ref name="Doosan Weather">{{cite web |url=http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=182272&contentno=182272 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130122062119/http://www.encyber.com/search_w/ctdetail.php?masterno=182272&contentno=182272 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-22 |script-title=ko:포천시 |trans-title=Pocheon |language=ko |publisher=[[Doosan Encyclopedia]] |date=2007-08-13 |access-date=2010-02-19 }}</ref>
