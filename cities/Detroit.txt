Detroit is named after the [[Detroit River]], connecting [[Lake Huron]] with [[Lake Erie]].

During the [[French and Indian War]] (1754–63)—the North American front of the [[Seven Years' War]] between the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]] and the [[Kingdom of France]]—British troops gained control of the settlement in 1760 and shortened its name to Detroit. Several regional Native American tribes, such as the [[Potawatomi|Potowatomi]], [[Ojibwe]] and Huron, launched [[Pontiac's War]] in 1763 and [[siege of Fort Detroit|laid siege]] to [[Fort Detroit]] but failed to capture it. In defeat, France ceded its territory in North America east of the Mississippi to Britain following the war.<ref>{{cite web

When Great Britain evicted France from [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], it also removed one barrier to American colonists migrating west.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://totallyhistory.com/french-and-indian-war/|title=The French & Indian War, Seven Years War Summary|date=September 9, 2011|website=Totally History}}</ref> British negotiations with the Iroquois would both prove critical and lead to the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which limited settlements below the Great Lakes and west of the [[Alleghenies]]. Many colonists and pioneers in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] resented and then defied this restraint, later becoming supporters of the [[American Revolution]]. By 1773, after the addition of the [[Anglo-Americans|Anglo-American]] settlers, the population of Detroit was 1,400. During the American Revolutionary War, the indigenous and loyalist raids of 1778 and the resultant 1779 decisive [[Sullivan Expedition]] reopened the [[Ohio Country]] to even more westward emigration, which began almost immediately. By 1778, its population reached 2,144 and it was the third-largest city in what was known as the [[Province of Quebec (1763–91)|Province of Quebec]] since the British takeover of former French colonial possessions.<ref>Jacqueline Peterson, Jennifer S. H. Brown, ''Many Roads to Red River'' (2001), p69</ref>

After the American Revolutionary War and the establishment of the [[United States]] as an independent country, Britain ceded Detroit and other territories in the region under the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|1783 Treaty of Paris]], which established the southern border with its remaining colonial provinces in [[British North America]], later [[Upper Canada]]. However, the area remained under British control, and its forces did not withdraw until 1796, following the [[Jay Treaty|1794 Jay Treaty]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Detroit-a-Chronicle-of-Its-Progress-Volume-1/105630/110 |title="History of Detroit: A Chronicle of Its Progress" Page 71, 1912 |website=Mocavo.com |access-date=October 22, 2024}}</ref> By the turn of the 19th century, white American settlers began pouring westwards.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://exhibitions.nysm.nysed.gov/historicalmarkers/inventoryfour.html|title=Museum Outreach|website=exhibitions.nysm.nysed.gov}}</ref>

The region's then colonial economy was based on the lucrative [[North American fur trade|fur trade]], in which numerous Native American people had important roles as trappers and traders. Today the [[flag of Detroit]] reflects its both its French and English colonial heritage. Descendants of the earliest French and [[French Canadian|French-Canadian]] settlers formed a cohesive community, who gradually were superseded as the dominant population after more Anglo-American settlers arrived in the early 19th century with American westward migration. Living along the shores of Lake St. Clair and south to [[Monroe, Michigan|Monroe]] and downriver suburbs, the ethnic French Canadians of Detroit, also known as [[Muskrat French]] in reference to the fur trade, remain a subculture in the region in the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web|last1=LaForest|first1=James|title='Muskrat French': French-Canadian River Culture in the Windsor/Detroit Region|url=https://voyageurheritage.wordpress.com/2014/03/07/muskrat-french-french-canadian-river-culture-in-the-windsordetroit-region/|website=Voyageur Heritage: Community Journal and Resource Guide|date=March 7, 2014|publisher=James LaForest|access-date=September 5, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Beneteau|first1=Marcel|title=Detroit River: A Special Place in French North American History|url=http://www.ameriquefrancaise.org/en/article-453/Detroit_River:_A_Special_Place_in_French_North_American_History.html|website=Encyclopedia of French Cultural Heritage in North America|access-date=September 5, 2015}}</ref>

The [[Great Fire of 1805]] destroyed most of the Detroit settlement, which had primarily buildings made of wood. One stone fort, a river warehouse, and brick chimneys of former wooden homes were the sole structures to survive.<ref>[http://www.ste-anne.org/dempsey.html "Ste.

From 1805 to 1847, Detroit was the capital of Michigan [[Michigan Territory|as a territory]] and as a state. [[William Hull]], the United States commander at Detroit, surrendered without a fight to British troops and their Native American allies during the [[War of 1812]] in the [[siege of Detroit]], believing his forces were vastly outnumbered. The [[Battle of Frenchtown]] was part of a U.S. effort to retake the city, and U.S. troops suffered their highest fatalities of any battle in the war. This battle is commemorated at [[River Raisin National Battlefield Park]] south of Detroit in [[Monroe County, Michigan|Monroe County]]. Detroit was recaptured by the United States later that year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/rira/learn/historyculture/index.htm|title=River Raisin National Battlefield Park|website=Nps.gov}}</ref>

The settlement was incorporated as a city in 1815.<ref name=Woodford/> As the city expanded, a radial geometric street plan developed by Chief Justice [[Augustus B. Woodward]] was followed, featuring grand boulevards as in [[Paris]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.metrotimes.com/the-scene/archives/2018/06/01/how-the-woodward-plan-for-greater-detroit-died-200-years-ago-today|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201112015104/https://www.metrotimes.com/the-scene/archives/2018/06/01/how-the-woodward-plan-for-greater-detroit-died-200-years-ago-today|url-status=dead|archive-date=November 12, 2020|title=How the Woodward Plan for greater Detroit died 200 years ago today|first=Michael|last=Jackman|date=June 1, 2018|website=Detroit Metro Times}}</ref> In 1817, Woodward went on to establish the [[Catholepistemiad]], or University of Michigania in the city. Intended to be a centralized system of schools, libraries, and other cultural and scientific institutions for the Michigan Territory, the Catholepistemiad evolved into the modern University of Michigan.

Prior to the [[American Civil War]], the city's access to the Canada–US border made it a key stop for [[Fugitive slaves in the United States|refugee slaves]] gaining freedom in the North along the [[Underground Railroad]]. Many went across the Detroit River to Canada to escape pursuit by slave catchers.<ref name="Chadwick">{{cite book | last = Chadwick | first = Bruce | title = Traveling the underground railroad : a visitor's guide to more than 300 sites | publisher = Carol Pub.

Numerous men from Detroit volunteered to fight for the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the Civil War, including the [[24th Michigan Infantry Regiment]]. It was part of the [[Iron Brigade]], which fought with distinction and suffered 82% casualties at the [[Battle of Gettysburg]] in 1863. When the First Volunteer Infantry Regiment arrived to fortify [[Washington, D.C.]], President [[Abraham Lincoln]] is quoted as saying, "Thank God for Michigan!" [[George Armstrong Custer]] led the [[Michigan Brigade]] during the Civil War and called them the "Wolverines".<ref>Rosentreter, Roger (July/August 1998). "Come on you Wolverines, Michigan at Gettysburg", ''[[Michigan History (magazine)|Michigan History]]''.</ref> The city's tensions over race, and nationally, the [[New York City draft riots|draft]] led to the [[Detroit race riot of 1863]], in which violence erupted, leaving some dead and over 200 Black residents homeless. This prompted the establishment of a full-time [[Detroit Police Department#History|police force]] in 1865.

During the late 19th century, wealthy industry and shipping magnates commissioned the design and construction of several [[Gilded Age]] mansions east and west of the current downtown, along the major avenues of the Woodward plan. Most notable among them was the [[David Whitney House]] at 4421 [[Woodward Avenue]], and the grand avenue became a favored address for mansions. During this period, some referred to Detroit as the "Paris of the West" for its architecture, grand avenues in the Paris style, and for Washington Boulevard, recently electrified by [[Thomas Edison]].<ref name=Woodford/> The city had grown steadily from the 1830s with the rise of shipping, shipbuilding, and manufacturing industries. Strategically located along the Great Lakes waterway, Detroit emerged as a major [[Port of Detroit|port]] and transportation hub. {{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

In 1896, a thriving carriage trade prompted [[Henry Ford]] to build his first automobile in a rented workshop on Mack Avenue. During this growth period, Detroit expanded its borders by annexing all or part of several surrounding villages and townships.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why do Hamtramck and Highland Park exist inside the city of Detroit?|url=https://wdet.org/posts/2014/09/19/80119-why-do-hamtramck-and-highland-park-exist-inside-the-city-of-detroit/|access-date=January 14, 2021|date=September 19, 2014|website=Wdet.org|language=en}}</ref>

In 1903, Henry Ford founded the [[Ford Motor Company]]. Ford's manufacturing—and those of automotive pioneers [[William C. Durant]], [[Horace Elgin Dodge|Horace]] and [[John Francis Dodge|John]] Dodge, [[James Ward Packard|James]] and [[William Doud Packard|William]] Packard, and [[Walter Chrysler]]—established the [[Big Three (automobile manufacturers)|Big Three]] automakers and cemented Detroit's status in the early 20th century as the world's automotive capital.<ref name="Woodford" /> The growth of the [[Automotive industry in the United States|auto industry]] was reflected by changes in businesses throughout the Midwest and nation, with the development of garages to service vehicles and gas stations, as well as factories for parts and tires.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} Because of the booming auto industry, Detroit became the fourth-largest city in the nation by 1920, following [[New York City]], [[Chicago]], and [[Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Biggest US Cities in 1920 - Historical Population Data|url=https://www.biggestuscities.com/1920|access-date=June 4, 2021|website=www.biggestuscities.com}}</ref>

In 1907, the Detroit River carried 67,292,504 tons of shipping commerce through Detroit to locations all over the world. For comparison, [[London]] shipped 18,727,230 tons, and [[New York City|New York]] shipped 20,390,953 tons. The river was dubbed "the Greatest Commercial Artery on Earth" by ''[[The Detroit News]]'' in 1908. The [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol]] from 1920 to 1933 resulted in the Detroit River becoming a major conduit for smuggling of illegal Canadian spirits.<ref name="auto" />

With the rapid growth of industrial workers in the auto factories, [[labor unions]] such as the [[American Federation of Labor]] and the [[United Auto Workers]] (UAW) fought to organize workers to gain them better working conditions and wages. They initiated [[Strike action|strikes]] and other tactics in support of improvements such as [[Eight-hour day|the 8-hour day/40-hour work week]], increased wages, greater benefits, and improved [[Occupational safety and health|working conditions]]. The labor activism during those years increased the influence of union leaders in the city such as [[Jimmy Hoffa]] of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamsters]] and [[Walter Reuther]] of the UAW.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crosscurrents.hawaii.edu/content.aspx?lang=eng&site=us&theme=work&subtheme=UNION&unit=USWORK029|title=Important U.S. Labor Leaders: Jimmy Hoffa|date=2003|website=Cross Currents|publisher=CULCON (A Digital Cultural Resource of the US-Japan Conference on Cultural and Educational Interchange)|access-date=October 19, 2017 }}</ref>

Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following the rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) beginning in 1915. "By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK", whose members primarily opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants but also practiced discrimination against Black Americans.<ref name="43riots">[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/eleanor-riots/ "Detroit Race Riots 1943"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170301013611/http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/eleanor-riots/ |date=March 1, 2017 }}.

One-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic organizer with the federal [[Works Progress Administration]].

By 1940, 80% of Detroit deeds contained [[restrictive covenants]] prohibiting African Americans from buying houses they could afford. These discriminatory tactics were successful as a majority of black people in Detroit resorted to living in all-black neighborhoods such as [[Black Bottom, Detroit|Black Bottom]] and Paradise Valley.

In this postwar era, the auto industry continued to create opportunities for many African Americans from the South, who continued with their Great Migration to Detroit and other northern and western cities to escape the strict [[Jim Crow laws]] and racial discrimination policies of the South. Postwar Detroit was a prosperous industrial center of mass production. The auto industry comprised about 60% of all industry in the city, allowing space for a plethora of separate booming businesses including stove making, brewing, furniture building, oil refineries, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and more. The expansion of jobs created unique opportunities for black Americans, who saw novel high employment rates: there was a 103% increase in the number of blacks employed in postwar Detroit. Black Americans who immigrated to northern industrial cities from the south still faced intense racial discrimination in the employment sector. Racial discrimination kept the workforce and better jobs predominantly white, while many black Detroiters held lower-paying factory jobs. Despite changes in demographics as the city's black population expanded, Detroit's police force, fire department, and other city jobs continued to be held by predominantly white residents. This created an unbalanced racial power dynamic.<ref name=tjs1>{{Cite book|last=Sugrue|first=Thomas J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/59879791|title=The origins of the urban crisis: race and inequality in postwar Detroit : with a new preface by the author|date=August 21, 2005|isbn=0-691-12186-9|edition=1st Princeton Classic |location=Princeton|oclc=59879791}}</ref>

Unequal opportunities in employment resulted in unequal housing opportunities for the majority of the black community: with overall lower incomes and facing the backlash of discriminatory housing policies, the black community was limited to lower cost, lower quality housing in the city. The surge in the black population augmented the strain on housing scarcity. The livable areas available to the black community were limited, and as a result, families often crowded together in unsanitary, unsafe, and illegal quarters. Such discrimination became increasingly evident in the policies of [[redlining]] implemented by banks and federal housing groups, which almost completely restricted the ability of blacks to improve their housing and encouraged white people to guard the racial divide that defined their neighborhoods. As a result, black people were often denied bank loans to obtain better housing, and interest rates and rents were unfairly inflated to prevent their moving into white neighborhoods. White residents and political leaders largely opposed the influx of black Detroiters to white neighborhoods, believing that their presence would lead to neighborhood deterioration. This perpetuated a cyclical exclusionary process that marginalized the agency of black Detroiters by trapping them in the unhealthiest, least safe areas of the city.<ref name=tjs1/>

[[Largest cities in the United States by population by decade#1950|As in other major American cities]] in the postwar era, [[modernist]] planning ideology drove the construction of a federally subsidized, extensive highway and freeway system around Detroit, and pent-up demand for new housing stimulated [[suburbanization#United States|suburbanization]]; highways made commuting by car for higher-income residents easier. However, this construction had negative implications for many lower-income urban residents. Highways were constructed through and completely demolished neighborhoods of poor residents and black communities who had less political power to oppose them. The neighborhoods were mostly low income, considered blighted, or made up of older housing where investment had been lacking due to racial redlining, so the highways were presented as a kind of urban renewal. These neighborhoods (such as Black Bottom and Paradise Valley) were extremely important to the black communities of Detroit, providing spaces for independent black businesses and social/cultural organizations. Their destruction displaced residents with little consideration of the effects of breaking up functioning neighborhoods and businesses.<ref name=tjs1/>

In 1956, Detroit's last heavily used [[streetcar|electric streetcar line]], which traveled along the length of Woodward Avenue, was removed and replaced with gas-powered buses. It was the last line of what had once been a 534-mile network of electric streetcars. In 1941, at peak times, a streetcar ran on Woodward Avenue every 60 seconds.<ref name="Peter Gavrilovich 2000 p.232">Peter Gavrilovich & Bill McGraw (2000) ''The Detroit Almanac: 300 Years of Life in the Motor City''. p. 232</ref><ref>[http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9040 "News+Views: Back track"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317102927/http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=9040 |date=March 17, 2012 }}, ''Metro Times'', Retrieved on July 16, 2013.</ref>

All of these changes in the area's transportation system favored low-density, auto-oriented development rather than high-density urban development. Industry also moved to the suburbs, seeking large plots of land for single-story factories. By the 21st century, the metro Detroit area had developed as one of the most [[Urban sprawl|sprawling]] job markets in the United States; combined with poor public transport, this resulted in many new jobs being beyond the reach of urban low-income workers.<ref>[http://www.freep.com/article/20130418/BUSINESS06/304180118/jobs-sprawl-Detroit-Brookings-Institution "Metro Detroit job sprawl worst in U.S.; many jobs beyond reach of poor"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130423013648/http://www.freep.com/article/20130418/BUSINESS06/304180118/jobs-sprawl-Detroit-Brookings-Institution |date=April 23, 2013 }}, ''Detroit Free Press''.

In 1950, the city held about one-third of the state's population. Over the next 60 years, the city's population declined to less than 10 percent of the state's population. During the same time period, the sprawling metropolitan area grew to contain more than half of Michigan's population.<ref name=Woodford/> The shift of population and jobs eroded Detroit's tax base.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

Longstanding tensions in Detroit culminated in the [[1967 Detroit riot|Twelfth Street riot]] in July 1967. Governor [[George W. Romney]] ordered the [[Michigan National Guard]] into Detroit, and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] sent in U.S. Army troops. The result was 43 dead, 467 injured, over 7,200 arrests, and more than 2,000 buildings destroyed, mostly in black residential and business areas. Thousands of small businesses closed permanently or relocated to safer neighborhoods. The affected district lay in ruins for decades.<ref>Sidney Fine, ''Violence in the Model City: The Cavanaugh Administration, Race Relations, and the Detroit Riot of 1967'' (1989)</ref> According to the ''Chicago Tribune'', it was the 3rd most costly riot in the United States.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The 10 most-costly riots in the U.S. |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/chi-insurance-civil-unrest-riots-bix-gfx-20141126-htmlstory.html |access-date=November 2, 2022 |website=Chicago Tribune|date=November 26, 2014 }}</ref>

On August 18, 1970, the [[NAACP]] filed suit against Michigan state officials, including Governor [[William Milliken]], charging ''de facto'' public school segregation. The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain [[Racial segregation in the United States#Education|racial segregation]] in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, as the composition of students in the schools followed segregated neighborhoods.<ref name=Meinke2011>{{cite journal|last=Meinke|first=Samantha|title=Milliken v Bradley: The Northern Battle for Desegregation|journal=Michigan Bar Journal|date=September 2011|volume=90|issue=9|pages=20–22|url=http://www.michbar.org/journal/pdf/pdf4article1911.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121215065214/http://www.michbar.org/journal/pdf/pdf4article1911.pdf |archive-date=December 15, 2012 |url-status=live|access-date=July 27, 2012}}</ref> The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling.

In November 1973, the city elected [[Coleman Young]] as its first black mayor. After taking office, Young emphasized increasing racial diversity in the police department, which was predominantly white.<ref>{{cite web|title=Detroit Police Department|url=http://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/detroit-police-department|website=Detroit Historical Society|access-date=April 23, 2015}}</ref> Young also worked to improve Detroit's transportation system, but the tension between Young and his suburban counterparts over regional matters was problematic throughout his mayoral term.

In 1976, the federal government offered $600&nbsp;million (~${{Format price|{{Inflation|index=US-GDP|value=600000000|start_year=1976}}}} in {{Inflation/year|US-GDP}}) for building a regional [[rapid transit]] system, under a single regional authority.<ref>{{cite news|last=Austin|first=Dan|title=How metro Detroit transit went from best to worst|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/2015/02/06/michigan-detroit-public-transit/22926133/|newspaper=Detroit Free Press|date=February 6, 2015|access-date=April 21, 2015}}</ref> But the inability of Detroit and its suburban neighbors to solve conflicts over transit planning resulted in the region losing the majority of funding for rapid transit.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}} The city then moved forward with construction of the elevated downtown circulator portion of the system, which became known as the [[Detroit People Mover]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Felton|first=Ryan|title=How Detroit ended up with the worst public transit|url=http://www.metrotimes.com/detroit/how-detroit-ended-up-with-the-worst-public-transit/Content?oid=2143889|date=March 11, 2014|access-date=April 21, 2015|newspaper=Metro Times}}</ref>

The gasoline crises of [[1973 oil crisis|1973]] and [[1979 oil crisis|1979]] affected auto industry. Buyers chose smaller, more fuel-efficient cars made by foreign makers as the price of gas rose. Efforts to revive the city were stymied by the struggles of the auto industry, as their sales and market share declined. Automakers laid off thousands of employees and closed plants in the city, further eroding the tax base. To counteract this, the city used [[eminent domain]] to build two large new auto assembly plants in the city.<ref>{{cite news|title=Poletown Becomes Just a Memory: GM Plant Opens, Replacing Old Detroit Neighborhood|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-09-18-fi-6228-story.html|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first=James|last=Risen|date=September 18, 1985}}</ref>

Young sought to revive the city by seeking to increase investment in the city's declining downtown. The [[Renaissance Center]], a mixed-use office and retail complex, opened in 1977.

Despite the Renaissance Center and other projects, the downtown area continued to lose businesses to the [[Car dependency|automobile-dependent]] suburbs. Major stores and hotels closed, and many large office buildings went vacant. Young was criticized for being too focused on downtown development and not doing enough to lower the city's high crime rate and improve city services to residents.{{citation needed|date=July 2020}}

High unemployment was compounded by [[middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, and some residents leaving the state to find work. The result for the city was a higher proportion of poor in its population, reduced tax base, depressed property values, abandoned buildings, abandoned neighborhoods, and high crime rates.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Detroit and Deindustrialization {{!}} Dollars & Sense |url=https://www.dollarsandsense.org/archives/2013/0913bluestone.html |access-date=March 6, 2024 |website=www.dollarsandsense.org}}</ref>

One way the city obtained this money was through the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] (DIA).

One of the largest post-bankruptcy efforts to improve city services has been to fix the city's broken street lighting system. At one time it was estimated that 40% of lights were not working, which resulted in public safety issues and abandonment of housing. The plan called for replacing outdated [[Sodium-vapor lamp|high-pressure sodium light]]s with 65,000 LED lights. Construction began in late 2014 and finished in December 2016; Detroit is the largest U.S. city with all LED street lighting.<ref>{{cite news|last=Reindl|first=JC|title=Detroit Rising: And then there were streetlights|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2015/11/12/detroit-street-lighting-project-update/31850609/|date=November 11, 2014|newspaper=Detroit Free Press}}</ref>

In the 1940s, [[Detroit blues]] artist [[John Lee Hooker]] became a long-term resident in the [[Delray, Detroit|Delray]] neighborhood. Hooker, among other important blues musicians, migrated from his home in Mississippi, bringing the [[Delta blues]] to Detroit. Hooker recorded for [[Fortune Records]], the biggest pre-Motown blues/soul label. During the 1950s, the city became a center for jazz, with stars performing in the Black Bottom neighborhood.<ref name=Woodford/> Prominent emerging jazz musicians included trumpeter [[Donald Byrd]] (who attended Cass Tech and performed with [[Art Blakey]] and [[the Jazz Messengers]] early in his career) and saxophonist [[Pepper Adams]] (who enjoyed a solo career and accompanied Byrd on several albums).

Other prominent Motor City R&B stars in the 1950s and early 1960s were [[Nolan Strong]], [[Andre Williams (musician)|Andre Williams]], and [[Nathaniel Mayer]]—who all scored local and national hits on the [[Fortune Records]] label. According to [[Smokey Robinson]], Strong was a primary influence on his voice as a teenager. The Fortune label, a family-operated label on Third Avenue, was owned by the husband-and-wife team of Jack Brown and Devora Brown. Fortune—which also released country, gospel and rockabilly LPs and 45s—laid the groundwork for Motown, which became Detroit's most legendary record label.<ref name=Carson>{{Cite book |first= David A. |last= Carson |title= Noise, and Revolution: The Birth of Detroit Rock 'n' Roll |publisher= University of Michigan Press |year= 2005 |isbn= 0-472-11503-0 }}</ref>

[[Berry Gordy, Jr.]] founded [[Motown Records]], which rose to prominence during the 1960s and early 1970s with acts such as [[Stevie Wonder]], [[the Temptations]], [[the Four Tops]], [[Smokey Robinson & the Miracles]], [[Diana Ross & the Supremes]], [[the Jackson 5]], [[Martha and the Vandellas]], [[The Spinners (American group)|the Spinners]], [[Gladys Knight & the Pips]], [[the Marvelettes]], [[the Elgins]], [[The Monitors (American band)|the Monitors]], [[the Velvelettes]], and [[Marvin Gaye]]. Artists were backed by in-house vocalists<ref>''Girl Groups – Fabulous Females Who Rocked The World'', by John Clemente</ref> [[the Andantes]] and [[the Funk Brothers]].

"The Motown sound" played an important role in the crossover appeal with popular music, since it was the first African American–owned record label to primarily feature African-American artists. Gordy moved Motown to Los Angeles in 1972 to pursue film production, but the company has since returned to Detroit. [[Aretha Franklin]], another Detroit R&B star, carried the Motown sound; however, she did not record with Berry's Motown label.<ref name=Almanac2/>

The group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] emphasized the city's connection with rock in the song "[[Detroit Rock City]]" and the movie produced in 1999. In the 1980s, Detroit was an important center of the [[hardcore punk rock]] underground with many nationally known bands coming out of the city and its suburbs, such as [[the Necros]], [[the Meatmen]], and [[Negative Approach]].<ref name="Carson"/>

{{Main|Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit}}
Metro Detroit has an extensive toll-free network of freeways administered by the [[Michigan Department of Transportation]]. Four major Interstate Highways surround the city. Detroit is connected via [[Interstate 75 in Michigan|I-75]] and [[Interstate 96|I-96]] to [[Ontario Highway 401|Kings Highway 401]] and to major [[Southern Ontario]] cities such as [[London, Ontario]] and the [[Greater Toronto Area]]. I-75 (Chrysler and Fisher freeways) is the region's main north–south route, serving [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]], and Detroit, before continuing south (as the Detroit–Toledo and Seaway Freeways) to serve many of the communities along the shore of Lake Erie.<ref name="Cantor">{{Cite book |last= Cantor |first= George |title= Detroit: An Insiders Guide to Michigan |year= 2005 |publisher= University of Michigan Press |isbn= 0-472-03092-2 |url= https://archive.org/details/exploremichigand0000cant }}</ref>

[[Interstate 94 in Michigan|I-94]] (Edsel Ford Freeway) runs east–west through Detroit and serves Ann Arbor to the west (where it continues to [[Chicago]]) and Port Huron to the northeast. The stretch of the I-94 freeway from Ypsilanti to Detroit was one of America's earlier limited-access highways. [[Henry Ford]] built it to link the factories at Willow Run and Dearborn during World War II. A portion was known as the Willow Run Expressway. The I-96 freeway runs northwest–southeast through Livingston, Oakland and Wayne counties and (as the Jeffries Freeway through Wayne County) has its eastern terminus in downtown Detroit.<ref name="Cantor"/>

[[Interstate 275 (Michigan)|I-275]] runs north–south from I-75 in the south to the junction of I-96 and [[Interstate 696|I-696]] in the north, providing a bypass through the western suburbs of Detroit. [[Interstate 375 (Michigan)|I-375]] is a short spur route in downtown Detroit, an extension of the Chrysler Freeway. I-696 (Reuther Freeway) runs east–west from the junction of I-96 and I-275, providing a route through the northern suburbs of Detroit. Taken together, I-275 and I-696 form a semicircle around Detroit. Michigan state highways designated with the letter M serve to connect major freeways.<ref name="Cantor"/>
