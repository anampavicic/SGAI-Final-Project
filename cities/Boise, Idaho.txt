==History==
{{For timeline}}
{{Expand section|date=September 2021}}

===Etymology===
[[File:Tubers Float the Boise River.JPG|thumb|220px|Floating the [[Boise River]]]]
The origin of the name is uncertain. One account credits Capt. [[Benjamin Bonneville|B. L. E. Bonneville]] of the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as its source. After trekking for weeks through dry and rough [[terrain]], his exploration party reached an overlook with a view of the [[Treasure Valley|Boise River Valley]]. The place where they stood is called Bonneville Point, located on the [[Oregon Trail]] east of the city. According to the story, a [[French language|French]]-speaking guide, overwhelmed by the sight of the verdant river, yelled "{{lang|fr|Les bois! Les bois!}}" ("The woods! The woods!")—and the name stuck.

The name may also derive from earlier [[Mountain man|mountain men]] who named the river that flows through the city. In the 1820s, [[French Canadian]] [[fur trapping|fur trappers]] associated with the British-owned [[Hudson's Bay Company]] set trap lines in the vicinity. Set in a high-desert area, the tree-lined valley of the Boise River became a distinct landmark, an [[oasis]] dominated by [[Populus sect. Aigeiros|cottonwood]] trees. This led the French trappers to call the area "{{lang|fr|la rivière boisée}}" ("the wooded river").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahohistory.net/reference%20series/0032.pdf|title=The name "Boise" |publisher=IdahoHistory.net|date=July 7, 2010|access-date=November 28, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090930214321/http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference%20Series/0032.pdf |archive-date=September 30, 2009 }}</ref>

===Tribes and First Contact===
The area of Boise valley was inhabited by Boise Valley [[Northern Shoshone|Shoshone]] and [[Bannock people|Bannock]] tribes, a part of the "[[Snake Indians|Snake Country]]". According to the City of Boise's "History of Boise" report, "they gathered annually in the valley to participate in trading rendezvous with other tribes and catch salmon in the Boise River runs to help sustain them year-round. They spent winters in the valley where the climate was milder and visited the hot springs for bathing and healing. Castle Rock, called Eagle Rock by the tribes, was and remains a sacred site."<ref>{{cite web |last=Boise |first=City of |url=http://www.boiseuu.org/msearch/brochures/HistoryOfBoise.pdf |title=History of Boise; City of Boise, Boise Department of Arts & History, Idaho Statesman |publisher=City of Boise |date=2013 |access-date=February 6, 2021 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210207031522/http://www.boiseuu.org/msearch/brochures/HistoryOfBoise.pdf |archive-date=February 7, 2021 }}</ref>

Boise Valley [[Bannock people|Bannock]] tribes belonged to the "tuuˀagaidɨkaˀa" (black trout eaters).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |title=tuuˀagaidɨkaˀa|encyclopedia=Northern Paiute–Bannock Dictionary |date=2012 |last1=Liljeblad |first1=Sven |last2=Fowler |first2=Catherine S. |last3= Powell| first3= Glenda |publisher=University of Utah Press |location=Salt Lake City, Utah |isbn=9781607819684 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U7Nfd8J7FmwC|page=596}}</ref> Boise Valley [[Northern Shoshone|Shoshone]] belonged to the "Yahandeka" (groundhog eaters) grouping. They were among the early mounted Shoshone bands. They traveled over a considerable range by the beginning of the nineteenth century, with their main hunting lands along the lower [[Boise River]] and [[Payette River]]. When Donald MacKenzie developed the Snake country fur trade after 1818, the most prominent of the Boise Shoshone, Peiem (a Shoshoni rendition of "Big Jim", their leader's English name), became the most influential leader of the large composite Shoshoni band that white trappers regularly encountered in the [[Snake Indians|Snake Country]].

In 1811, [[Wilson Price Hunt|Wilson Hunt]], employed as an agent in the fur trade under [[John Jacob Astor]], organized and led the greater part of a group of about 60 men<ref name="bancroft">{{cite book |last1=Bancroft |first1=Hubert Howe |title=History of the Northwest Coast, vol. 2.

Accessed May 6, 2022. [http://thefurtrapper.com/home/wilson-hunt/ Link].</ref><ref>“Wilson Price Hunt Expedition Historical Marker.” Historical Marker, October 18, 2020. [https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=119203 Link].</ref> Because of the [[War of 1812]] and the lack of U.S. fur trading posts in the Pacific Northwest, most of the route was not used in the following two decades, and thus Snake Country remained free of settler incursions.

After the conclusion of the war of 1812, up until the 1840s, [[Oregon Country|Oregon]], while officially "jointly administered", was solely dominated by the British [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC), which had a land connection to the inland of the Canadian Prairies via [[York Factory Express]]. Snake Country, including Boise Valley remained independent and relatively free of settler passage and incursion. This was due to two main reasons. Firstly, the general region to the East of the Cascades and west of Rockies at the time, was described in the media and literature of Eastern US as the "[[Great American Desert]]", an arid unproductive region, unsuitable for habitation.<ref name=Meinig>[[D.W. Meinig|Meinig, D.W.]] (1993). ''The Shaping of America: A Geographical Perspective on 500 Years of History, Volume 2: Continental America, 1800-1867.'' New Haven: Yale University Press. p.76<. {{ISBN|0-300-05658-3}}</ref><ref>Staff (2011) [https://www.kshs.org/teachers/read_kansas/pdfs/m41card01.pdf "Major Long and the 'Great American Desert'"], Kansas Historical Society</ref> Thus the region of Boise itself was of no interest to settlers. [[Oregon Country]], on the other side of the Cascades, was however a desirable destination for settlers. Nevertheless, the British had an official policy of discouraging American settlers. Thus, settler incursions into Boise Valley along the [[Oregon Trail]] remained low, until early 1840s.

The [[Hudson's Bay Company|HBC]] established a fort in the region, the [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise (1834-54)|Old Fort Boise]], {{convert|40|mi|0}} west, near [[Parma, Idaho|Parma]], down the [[Boise River]] near its [[confluence]] with the [[Snake River]] at the [[Oregon]] border. They were present in the fort until 1844, handing the fort over to the [[United States Army]] afterwards.

===Oregon Trail===
Starting from early 1840s, developments further West, in modern Oregon, meant significant changes to the region of Boise. At this time, [[Hudson's Bay Company|HBC]] and the British started moving their operations further North into [[British Columbia]], while there was a slow and steady rise in number of settlers in [[Oregon Country]], who demanded annexation. These developments eventually culminated in [[Oregon Treaty]], in which the British gave the region up to the US, thus ending the era of "Joint occupation". This meant that Boise valley and much of Snake Country was claimed as [[Oregon Territory]].

With the discovery of gold in [[California]] in 1848 and the passage of [[Donation Land Claim Act]], the settler incursions increased exponentially. The increased settler incursions through [[Northern Shoshone|Shoshone]] and [[Bannock people|Bannock]] territories, and their increased exploitation of the valley's game and resources on their trip, resulted in an increasing sense of frustration among the Indigenous bands along the entire [[Oregon Trail]]. Thus, starting from early 1850s, to deter settler caravans from using the route and trespassing on their lands, Native peoples along the entire length of the trail, from modern Eastern [[Idaho]] to modern Central [[Oregon]] started staging low intensity attacks against passing caravans.<ref>Hubert Howe Bancroft, ''History of Oregon, Volume II, 1848-1888'', The History Company, San Francisco, 1888, p.462 note 4.</ref><ref name="Schlicke">Schlicke, Carl P. “MASSACRE ON THE OREGON TRAIL IN THE YEAR 1860.” COLUMBIA: The Magazine of Northwest History 1, no. 1 (1987). [https://www.washingtonhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/01-1_Schlicke-1.pdf Link]</ref>

One such attack, referred to as "Ward Massacre", was in Boise Valley, about 20 Miles to the West of modern Boise. On August 20, 1854, Alexander Ward's five-wagon caravan of 20 emigrants was passing through, when a group of [[Northern Shoshone|Shoshone]] and [[Bannock people|Bannock]] warriors ambushed the caravan. The goal of the ambush was initially to take away the horses of the caravan. However, shooting of one of the Shoshone warriors with a revolver, resulted in the killing of everyone except for two of Alexander Ward's children by the Shoshone warriors.<ref name="Dave High">High, Dave and Daniel Newcomer. "The Ward Massacre." Clio: Your Guide to History. June 20, 2016. Accessed May 6, 2022. [https://theclio.com/entry/23713 Link]</ref> In response, the [[United States Army]] launched the [[Winnas Expedition]], which involved raids on Native encampments for a period of several months during Summer of 1855. In the period between 1846 and 1856, 700 white settlers were killed along the entire length of [[Oregon Trail]] due to attacks and raids by Native warriors on their caravans while intruding native land. American military intrusion and retaliation only further angered the native tribes and escalated the conflict, which forced the [[United States Army]] to abandon [[Fort Boise#Old Fort Boise (1834-54)|Old Fort Boise]]. Intensified attacks against passing caravans made travel impossible for settlers except with [[United States Army|US Army]] escort, which started from 1858.

===Discovery of gold and silver===

The decline of the California gold rush prompted white settlers to search for gold elsewhere, including much of [[Idaho]]. The 1860 discovery of gold in [[Nez Perce]] territory near [[Pierce, Idaho]] and the resultant arrival of settlers raised tensions significantly.<ref name="KTVB">Holmes, Brian. “During the Gold Rush, Idaho City Became the Largest City in the Northwest.” ktvb.com, August 2, 2021. [https://www.ktvb.com/article/news/local/208/during-idaho-territory-gold-rush-idaho-city-became-largest-city-northwest-pacific/277-c9202682-1ca6-4ca9-afdb-6067e751d125 Link].</ref> In September of that year, the [[Utter Party Massacre]] happened about 100 miles Southeast of Boise, where 29 out of a group of 44 settlers were either killed or captured in an intense and organized ambush.

The discovery of gold around the Boise valley in 1863, together with ongoing fighting prompted the US Military to establish a new Fort Boise, where Boise is located today. The new location was selected because it was near the intersection of the Oregon Trail with a major road connecting the Boise Basin ([[Idaho City, Idaho|Idaho City]]) and the [[Owyhee River|Owyhee]] ([[Silver City, Idaho|Silver City]]) [[mining]] areas, both of which were booming. That year, the United States established [[Idaho Territory]], whose boundaries included this region. After a year, with the creation of [[Montana Territory]], Boise was made the territorial capital of a much reduced Idaho in a controversial decision which overturned a district court ruling by a one-vote majority in the territorial supreme court along geographic lines in 1866. There was no treaty and no agreement with any of the native tribes up to this point, and the violent resistance against incursion and settlement onto their territory along the [[Oregon Trail]] and at the newly-found gold mines continued unabated. In order to resolve the matter of ownership and sovereignty over land, [[Caleb Lyon]], the second governor of Idaho, negotiated with the Boise Valley [[Northern Shoshone|Shoshone]] Tribe, and concluded the "Treaty of Fort Boise" on October 10, 1864.<ref>Idaho State Historical Society. “Text of the Treaty of Fort Boise, October 10, 1864.” [https://cfw.nwcouncil.org/Content/Committees/Members/meetings/2011_0310/IdahoHistoricalRef-No91_TextOfTheTreatyOfFortBoise_10oct1864.pdf Link], September 1865.</ref> This treaty stipulated that the tribe will give up lands to 30 miles on each side of [[Boise River]], land upon which Boise is located, while allowing an equal right to fishing in the river to both the Shoshone and the settlers. The treaty has not been ratified by the US senate to this date, and the tribe hasn't ever received any treaty payments.<ref>“CALEB LYON OF LYONSDALE AND THE BOISE CLAIM.” Idaho State Historical Society Reference Series, December 1974. [https://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/0022.pdf Link].</ref>

Backlash from the perceived friendliness of [[Caleb Lyon]] in his dealing with the tribes led to an escalation of pressure and agitation among the White Settlers in Boise and the print media in the city, in demanding either genocide or removal of the tribes. Settler violence against Boise Valley native tribes increased considerably, with some going as far introducing bounties to murder any native.<ref name="idaho powers">Myers, Daniel. “An Archival Review and Ethnographic Study for the Relicensing of the Hells Canyon Complex Hydroelectrical Plants.” Idaho Power, July 2001. [https://docs.idahopower.com/pdfs/relicensing/hellscanyon/hellspdfs/techappendices/Cultural/e04_12.pdf Link].</ref> ''[[Idaho Statesman]]'', the daily newspaper of Boise, which started publishing in 1864, reflected many such incitements and demands:

{{blockquote|...that the military should continue killing Indians 'until the last Indian in the Territories was either on his reservation or enriched the sagebrush with his decaying carcass.' ...if the Indians refused to move there, 'they will be killed or put on the reservation by force, and certainly shot if they don't stay there.' Furthermore, the editor continues, 'The idea that the Indians have any right to the soil is ridiculous. ...They have no more rights to the soil of the Territories of the United States than wolves or coyotes...'|David B. Madsen's quotation of the opinion column in ''Idaho Statesman'' on July 29, 1867|<ref name="idaho powers"/>}}
{{blockquote|This would be our plan of establishing friendship upon an eternal basis with our Indians: Let all the hostile bands of Idaho Territory be called in (they will not be caught in any
other manner) to attend a grand treaty; plenty of blankets and nice little trinkets distributed among them; plenty of grub on hand; have a real jolly time with them; then just before the big feast put strychnine in their meat and poison to death the last mother's son of them.|A "Letter to the editor" that was printed in the ''Idaho Statesman'' newspaper on October 6, 1867|<ref name="idaho powers"/>}}

At the same time, native warriors around the valley, under the leadership of Howluck also known as "Bigfoot" among white settlers, among others, waged an escalating and intensified guerrilla campaign of harassment of passerby caravans along the [[Oregon Trail]]. The [[United States Army]] also escalated and intensified "punitive expeditions" against formations of warriors and against civilian communities as well. This marked the start of the "unofficial" [[Snake War]] in 1866.<ref name="idaho powers"/> This war lasted until 1868, and is statistically the deadliest of the Indian Wars in the West in terms of casualties. In the end, 1,762 men were counted as the casualties of this war from both sides.<ref>Michno, Gregory, '''The Deadliest Indian War in the West: The Snake Conflict, 1864-1868'''. Caldwell: Caxton Press, 2007. pp 345-346</ref>

In 1868, [[Fort Hall Indian Reservation]] was established in Southeastern Idaho, about 220 miles upstream, according to the terms of [[Fort Bridger Treaty Council of 1868|Fort Bridger Treaty]]. The Boise Valley [[Northern Shoshone|Shoshone]] and [[Bannock people|Bannock]] Tribes were not party to this treaty. Nevertheless, in April 1869, the [[United States Military]] embarked on a campaign of "Removal, rounding up of natives in the region including in and around Boise, and expelling them with cavalry escort to [[Fort Hall Indian Reservation]]. This period is known among the [[Northern Shoshone|Shoshone]] and [[Bannock people|Bannock]] people as '''Idaho's Trail of Tears'''. Some of the natives managed to escape, and they ran to either [[Duck Valley Indian Reservation|Duck Valley]] or [[Fort McDermitt Paiute and Shoshone Tribe|Fort McDermitt]] in Nevada.<ref>Murray, Crystl. “Idaho Natives: Shoshone-Bannocks Tribes.” IDAHO NATIVES | SHOSHONE-BANNOCKS TRIBES.

=== Incorporation and growth ===
[[File:Main Street, Looking East, Boise, ID.jpg|thumb|left|Main Street in 1911]]

Boise's early growth was significantly driven by its role in supplying the nearby gold towns that sprung up in the 1860s northeast and then southwest of the town. Miners sometimes wintered in Boise and a number of early prominent businessmen were miners who settled in town in the years after the gold rush waned.<ref name="MacGregor2006">{{Cite book |last=MacGregor |first=Carol Lynn |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/69423136 |title=Boise, Idaho, 1882-1910 : prosperity in isolation |date=2006 |publisher=Mountain Press Pub |isbn=0-87842-522-5 |location=Missoula, Mont. |oclc=69423136}}</ref> By 1864 substantial agricultural production was underway on easily irrigated lands near the river and three canal companies had been incorporated.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Early Irrigation Canals Pre-Project Ventures |url=https://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/0171.pdf |journal=Idaho State Historical Society Reference Series |location=Boise, Idaho |publisher=Idaho State Historical Society |issue=171}}</ref> Early transportation improvements were largely a result of toll road franchises awarded by the territorial legislature starting in the 1860s.

Two more unsuccessful attempts were made to organize a city administration by election before the 1866 version of the city charter was approved by voters on January 6, 1868. The growing number of homes and businesses, for which owners wanted proper legal title, may have contributed to the eventual success of incorporation. All of these rejected efforts to incorporate the city came ''after'' Boise had been controversially made the state capital in 1864 over strong opposition from northern Idaho interests. This decision reflected the rapid shift of population growth from north to south after the discovery of gold in southern Idaho.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Boise City Charter |url=https://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/0030.pdf |journal=Idaho State Historical Society Reference Series |publisher=Idaho State Historical Society |publication-place=Boise, Idaho |issue=30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |title=Location of Idaho's Territorial Capital |url=https://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/0344_Location-of-Idahos-Territorial-Capital.pdf |journal=Idaho Historical Society Reference Series |publisher=Idaho Historical Society |publication-place=Boise, Idaho |issue=344}}</ref> By 1868 Boise had over 400 permanent buildings with a wide range of commercial services. 1868 also marked the formal beginning of a long advocacy for railroad connections to other Idaho communities and, just as importantly, to other growing cities in the west such as Portland, Oregon.<ref name="Wells2000">{{Cite book |last=Wells |first=Merle W. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/46835336 |title=Boise : an illustrated history |date=2000 |publisher=American Historical Press |others=Arthur A.

Designed by [[Alfred B. Mullett]], the [[Assay Office (Boise, Idaho)|U.S. Assay Office]] at 210 Main Street was built in 1871 and today is a [[National Historic Landmark]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Survey |first=Historic American Buildings |title=U.

Boise began to earn its ''City of Trees'' nickname in this period with a popular focus on a range of tree planting projects. Thomas J. Davis planted several thousand fruit trees in 1864 and several other early businessmen either founded nurseries or orchards of their own. In the 1870s tree planting began in earnest in downtown Boise led by prominent hotels as well as businessmen and residents. In 1907 Davis donated 43 acres of his orchard property to the city for use as a park in the name of his wife Julia.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Trees in Early Boise |url=https://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/0031.pdf |journal=Idaho State Historical Society Reference Series |publisher=Idaho State Historical Society |publication-place=Boise, Idaho |issue=31}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Julia Davis Park |url=https://www.cityofboise.org/departments/parks-and-recreation/parks/julia-davis-park/ |access-date=March 8, 2023 |website=City of Boise}}</ref> Commercial agriculture continued to expand, but was slowed by the lack of reliable rail links to regional and national markets and by a lack of large scale irrigation projects, which themselves were often tied to hoped-for railroad projects for financing. A.D. Foote, a successful mining engineer, drew up plans to irrigate up to 500,000 acres immediately south of Boise in 1882, but progress was halting and smaller farms were the norm until after the turn of the century with most located near to the river bottom where soil was productive and irrigation more easily achieved.<ref name="Wells2000"/> Fruit orchards proliferated and sugar beets, still an important agricultural industry in Idaho, began to be widely cultivated in the 1890s. Cattle and sheep farming became increasingly important as the century closed. With the exception of dairy, most livestock products were exported from Idaho, unlike other agricultural products which were still largely scaled to support local markets. The timber industry also increasingly thrived in the Boise market in the 1880s and 1890s. Large quantities of timber were exported from elsewhere in Idaho, but a growing Boise supported the expansion of Alexander Rossi's sawmill, first established in 1865. Prominent early Boisean William Ridenbaugh had inherited control of the canal now bearing his name from his uncle William Morris in 1878 and later partnered with Rossi to expand the sawmill capacity under the name Rossi and Ridenbaugh Lumber Company. Their materials supported bridge building and the rapid expansion of Boise in the 1890s.<ref name="MacGregor2006" />

As with many early infrastructure ventures, electrification succeeded only after at least one false start. July 4, 1887, marked the start of electrical transmission from a plant located on the Bench. William Ridenbaugh provided expertise and manpower for the water supply and several months were spent rigging poles and lines from the Bench to the service area across the river.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=1977 |title=Boise Electric Plant |url=https://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/0492_Boise-Electric-Plant.pdf |journal=Idaho State Historical Society Reference Series |publisher=Idaho State Historical Society |publication-place=Boise, Idaho |publication-date=1977 |issue=492}}</ref> Additional electrical supplies allowed the building of an electric streetcar line in 1891. This ran without interruption until buses replaced the lines in 1927, tracking—and sometimes driving—the development of Boise and nearby communities. This system expanded over several decades, reaching into the North End, South Boise and across the river on Front St. A loop line, completed in 1912, ran as far as Caldwell and Nampa, providing transport throughout the valley. Three early trolley companies merged in 1912 to form the Idaho Traction Company with a depot at 7th and Bannock Streets downtown.<ref>{{Cite web |access-date=April 13, 2023 |title=Trolley Town |url=https://www.boisestate.edu/sps-urban/urban-resources/trolley-town/ |website=Boise State University |series=Urban Studies and Community Development}}</ref>

Additional services and urban amenities arrived in the 1890s as Boise grew. Exploratory drilling for hot water was successful in 1890 and by the end of the decade many homes along Warm Springs avenue were being heated by this source.<ref>{{Cite journal |year=1977 |title=Boise Natural Hot Water Heating System |url=https://history.idaho.gov/wp-content/uploads/0500_Boise-Natural-Hot-Water-Heating-System.pdf |journal=Idaho State Historical Society Reference Series |publisher=Idaho State Historical Society |publication-place=Boise, Idaho |issue=500}}</ref> A natatorium was built in 1892 close to the source of the hot water near the Idaho State Penitentiary. Churches serving several denominations, a Jewish synagogue, a major hardware store and department store, a Masonic hall, the Columbia Theater, Saint Alphonsus' Hospital, a number of parochial and secular schools, a City Hall and a new Union Pacific passenger station, constructed when service was finally extended to downtown, were all built during the 1890s. Falk's Department Store sponsored a semi-professional baseball team representing Boise from at least 1892 and the city supported other organized sports as they became popular.<ref name="Wells2000" /> The 12th Census of the United States lists the population of Boise in 1900 as 5,957, up from 2,311 in 1890, when Idaho was admitted as the 43rd state.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 28, 1900 |title=Population of Idaho by Counties and Minor Civil Divisions |url=https://www2.census.gov/library/publications/decennial/1900/bulletins/demographic/18-population-id.pdf |access-date=April 13, 2023 |publisher=United States Census Bureau |place=Washington, D.C.}}</ref>

In 1925, with the construction of [[Chicago]]-[[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] railway line, [[Boise Union Pacific Depot]] was established in the city. This train station served passengers until 1997.

A "homosexual panic" erupted in the city in 1955 during the [[lavender scare]]. Police interrogated hundreds of Boise citizens, arresting sixteen men whom police believed were part of a "homosexual ring." Arrests included prominent citizens, including a bank vice president. Their trials, which received sensational coverage in the local press, resulted in lengthy prison sentences; one man was sentenced to life in prison.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Lavender Scare |first=David K. |last=Johnson |date=March 22, 2023 |isbn=978-0226825724 |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |oclc=52197376 |page=98 }}</ref>

Boise is in [[southwestern Idaho]], about {{convert|41|mi}} east of the Oregon border and {{convert|110|mi|km|0}} north of the [[Nevada]] border. The [[downtown]] area's [[elevation]] is {{convert|2704|ft}} [[Sea level#AMSL|above sea level]].

Most of the metropolitan area lies on a broad, flat plain, descending to the west. Mountains rise to the northeast, stretching from the far southeastern tip of the Boise city limits to nearby [[Eagle, Idaho|Eagle]]. These mountains are known to locals as the Boise foothills and are sometimes described as the [[foothills]] of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. About {{convert|34|mi}} southwest of Boise, and about {{convert|26|mi}} southwest of [[Nampa, Idaho|Nampa]], the [[Owyhee Mountains]] lie entirely in neighboring [[Owyhee County, Idaho|Owyhee County]].

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has an area of {{convert|80.05|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|79.36|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.69|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref name="Gazetteer files">{{cite web|title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=December 18, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112090031/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=January 12, 2012 }}</ref> The city is drained by the Boise River and is considered part of the [[Treasure Valley]].

Boise occupies an area of {{convert|64|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}, according to the [[United States Census Bureau]]. Neighborhoods of Boise include the Bench, the North End, West Boise and Downtown. In January 2014, the Boise Police Department (BPD) partnered with the neighborhood blogging site [[Nextdoor]], the first city in the Northwest and the 137th city in the U.S. to do so.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://police.cityofboise.org/home/news-releases/2014/01/boise-police-join-nextdoorcom/ |title=Boise Police Department joins Nextdoor |publisher=Police.cityofboise.org |date=January 27, 2014 |access-date=August 19, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201192144/http://police.cityofboise.org/home/news-releases/2014/01/boise-police-join-nextdoorcom/ |archive-date=February 1, 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Since the app, which enables the city's police, fire, and parks departments to post to self-selected, highly localized areas, first became available in October 2011,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2013/10/21/2826016/nextdoor-neighbors-app-propels.htm|archive-url=https://archive.today/20140206035931/http://www.idahostatesman.com/2013/10/21/2826016/nextdoor-neighbors-app-propels.htm|url-status=dead|title=Idahostatesman.com Boise, ID|date=February 6, 2014|archive-date=February 6, 2014}}</ref> 101 neighborhoods and sections of neighborhoods have joined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/2014/01/16/2975542/city-of-boise-gets-neighborly.html |title=Boise, Meridian, Nampa, Caldwell news by Idaho Statesman |publisher=Idahostatesman.com |access-date=August 19, 2014}}</ref>

====Downtown Boise====
{{Main|Downtown Boise}}
Downtown Boise is Boise's cultural center and home to many small businesses as well as a growing number of high-rises. While downtown Boise lacks a major retail/dining focus like Seattle and Portland, the area has a variety of shops and growing option for dining choices. Centrally, 8th Street contains a pedestrian zone with sidewalk cafes and restaurants. The neighborhood has many local restaurants, bars, and boutiques and supports a vibrant nightlife. The area contains the Basque Block, which gives visitors a chance to learn about and enjoy Boise's Basque heritage. Downtown Boise's main attractions include the [[Idaho State Capitol]], the classic [[The Egyptian Theatre (Boise, Idaho)|Egyptian Theatre]] on the corner of Capitol Boulevard and Main Street, the [[Boise Art Museum]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boiseartmuseum.org/|title=Welcome to BAM|publisher=Boiseartmuseum.org|access-date=November 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117014828/http://www.boiseartmuseum.org/|archive-date=November 17, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> on Capitol in front of [[Julia Davis Park]], and Zoo Boise on the grounds of Julia Davis Park.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zooboise.org/|title=Home|publisher=Zooboise.org|access-date=November 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121127012350/http://www.zooboise.org/|archive-date=November 27, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Boise's economy was threatened in the late 1990s by commercial development at locations away from the downtown center, such as [[Boise Towne Square Mall]] and at shopping centers near new housing developments.<ref>[http://www.boisetownesquare.com/html/index3.asp] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201052425/http://www.boisetownesquare.com/html/index3.asp|date=February 1, 2015}}</ref>

====Boise State University====
To the south of downtown Boise is [[Boise State University]] and its surrounding environs. The area is dominated by residential neighborhoods and businesses catering to the student population. The unique blue playing field at the 37,000-seat [[Albertsons Stadium]] on the BSU campus, home to the [[Boise State Broncos football]] team, is a major city landmark. The campus is also home to the [[Benjamin Victor (sculptor)|Benjamin Victor]] Gallery and Studio.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://professorofpractice.boisestate.edu/benjaminvictor/gallery/|title=Benjamin Victor Gallery and Studio at Boise State University|work=Benjamin Victor, Professor of the Practice|access-date=June 16, 2017|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113171236/https://professorofpractice.boisestate.edu/benjaminvictor/gallery/|archive-date=November 13, 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref> Other cultural and sports centers in the area include the Velma V.

====The North End====
[[File:Hyde Park Boise.jpg|thumb|Hyde Park]]

The North End, generally defined as the part of Boise north of State Street, contains many of the city's older homes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northend.org/content1.asp?cat=12&id=32 |title=A Northend History |access-date=June 23, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704122651/http://northend.org/content1.asp?cat=12&id=32 |archive-date=July 4, 2015 }}</ref> It is known for its tree-lined drives such as Harrison Boulevard, and for its quiet neighborhoods near the downtown area. Downtown Boise is visible from [[Camel's Back Park]].<ref name="cityofboise1"/> On 13th Street, [[Hyde Park, Boise, Idaho|Hyde Park]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.northend.org/hydepark.htm|title=Northend.org|publisher=Northend.org|access-date=November 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060717194354/http://www.northend.org/hydepark.htm|archive-date=July 17, 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> is home to restaurants and other businesses. The North End also hosts events such as the annual Hyde Park Street Fair. In 2008, the American Planning Association designated Boise's North End one of 10 Great Neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.planning.org/greatplaces/|title=Great Places in America|publisher=Planning.org|date=February 24, 2011|access-date=November 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121203050136/http://www.planning.org/greatplaces/|archive-date=December 3, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Boise Highlands====
The Boise Highlands is just north of the North End; its location is generally defined as north of Hill Road and east of Bogus Basin Road. Annexed by the city in late 1965,<ref name=ltsanxx>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qrdeAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bTAMAAAAIBAJ&pg=5637%2C5967673 |work=Lewiston Morning Tribune |location=(Idaho) |agency=Associated Press |title=Boise population climbs again with latest annexation |date=December 29, 1965 |page=2}}</ref> the neighborhood is mostly filled with homes constructed in the 1970s, as well as the golf course of Crane Creek Country Club.

====Southwest Boise====
Southwest Boise contains sparsely populated neighborhoods built from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Many include acre-sized plots and the occasional farmhouse and pasture. In the 1980s, growth in the area was stunted to prevent [[urban sprawl]]. Since this has been lifted, there has been widespread growth of new homes and neighborhoods. The area lies near Interstate 84, and features, the [[Boise Airport]], theaters, shopping, golf and the Boise Bench area.

====Northwest Boise====
Northwest Boise lies against the Boise Foothills to the north, State Street to the south, the city of [[Eagle, Idaho|Eagle]] to the west, and downtown Boise to the east. It contains a mix of old and new neighborhoods, including Lakeharbor, which features the private Silver Lake, a reclaimed quarry. Northwest Boise has some pockets of older homes with a similar aesthetic to the North End. Downtown is minutes away, as is Veteran's Memorial Park<ref name="cityofboise1">{{cite web|url=http://parks.cityofboise.org/|title=Boise Parks & Recreation&nbsp;— City of Boise|publisher=Parks.cityofboise.org|date=November 21, 2012|access-date=November 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121122073552/http://parks.cityofboise.org/|archive-date=November 22, 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> and easy access to the [[Boise Greenbelt]]. Across the river sits the Boise Bench and to the west are the bedroom communities of Eagle, [[Star, Idaho|Star]], and [[Middleton, Idaho|Middleton]].

====Warm Springs and East End====
Warm Springs is centered on the tree-lined Warm Springs Avenue and contains some of Boise's largest and most expensive homes (many of which were erected by wealthy miners and businessmen around the turn of the 20th century; Victorian styles feature prominently). The area gets its name from the natural hot springs that flow from Boise's fault line and warm many of the area's homes. The Natotorium public swim center is here.

====Harris Ranch and Riverland East====
The far-east end of Warm Springs was once known as Barber Town, featuring a hotel with hot springs nestled into the foothills. It now has some new residential developments, with easy access to Highway 21, which leads to the south-central Idaho mountains, the Boise River, the Boise Foothills, Idaho Department of Parks and Recreation, and the Idaho Shakespeare Festival.

Southeast Boise ranges from Boise State University to Micron Technology between Federal Way and the Boise River. Its oldest neighborhood, Original South Boise, was platted in 1890, and accordingly has variegated housing (assiduously maintained by [[zoning]]); it consists of 33 blocks bordered by W Beacon Street, S Boise Avenue, and S Broadway Avenue, and hence is a triangular neighborhood immediately adjoining BSU.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityofboise.org/media/3620/original-south-boise-2003.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.cityofboise.org/media/3620/original-south-boise-2003.pdf |archive-date=October 9, 2022 |url-status=live |title=Original South Boise Neighborhood Plan |publisher=City of Boise |access-date=September 21, 2022}}</ref> The rest of Southeast Boise was developed over the decades, largely by a variety of [[suburbia|suburban]]-style homes.

Columbia Village subdivision and the older Oregon Trail Heights were the first major planned communities in Southeast Boise with an elementary and middle school all within walking distance from all homes. The subdivision is at the intersections of Interstate 84, Idaho 21, and Federal Way (former U.S. Highway), which are all major arteries to get anywhere in Boise. The subdivision, a baseball complex, and swimming pools were developed around the Simplot Sports complex. The fields are built over an old landfill and dump, and the fields and gravel parking lot allow radon gases to escape through the ground. The most recent planned community is the {{convert|35|acre|ha|adj=on}} Bown Crossing, which has easy access to the [[Boise Greenbelt]].<ref name="Bown Crossing">{{cite web |url=https://pds.cityofboise.org/innovative-development/projects/bowncrossing/ |title=Bown Crossing |date=January 18, 2018 |publisher=City of Boise |access-date=January 19, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119120814/https://pds.cityofboise.org/innovative-development/projects/bowncrossing/ |archive-date=January 19, 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

On August 25, 2008, at about 7:00&nbsp;pm, a fire started near Amity and Holcomb during a major windstorm. It destroyed ten houses and damaged nine. One person died in the fire.<ref name="NWCN">{{cite news|url=http://legacy.ktvb.com/story/news/local/2014/06/27/11463805/|title=Loose electrical connection blamed for Boise fire|date=October 14, 2009|work=KTVB|access-date=February 19, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309172753/http://legacy.ktvb.com/story/news/local/2014/06/27/11463805/|archive-date=March 9, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Boise Bench====
The Bench, generally bounded by Federal Way to the east, Cole Road to the west and [[Garden City, Idaho|Garden City]] to the north, sits on an elevation approximately {{convert|60|ft|m}} higher than downtown Boise to its northeast. Orchard Street is a major north–south thoroughfare in the neighborhood. The Bench is so named because of this sudden rise, giving the appearance of a step, or bench. The Bench (or Benches, there are three actual benches in the Boise Valley) was created as an ancient shoreline to the old river channel. The Bench is home to the [[Boise Union Pacific Depot]]. Like the North End, the Bench has older residential areas such as the Central Rim, Morris Hill, and Depot Bench neighborhoods. Due south of the Bench is the [[Boise Airport]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.iflyboise.com/|title=Boise Airport|publisher=iFlyBoise|access-date=November 28, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121129120812/http://www.iflyboise.com/|archive-date=November 29, 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

====West Boise====
West Boise is home to Boise Towne Square Mall, the largest in the state, as well as many restaurants, strip malls, and residential developments ranging from new subdivisions to apartment complexes. The Ada County jail and [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s printing division are also here. It is relatively the flattest section of Boise, with sweeping views of the Boise Front. West Boise also borders the city of [[Meridian, Idaho|Meridian]].
