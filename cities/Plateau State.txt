==Geography==
===Boundaries===
Plateau State is located in the North Central Zone out of the six [[geopolitical zones of Nigeria]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legit.ng/1094595-geopolitical-zones-nigeria-states.html|title=Geopolitical zones in Nigeria and their states|date=20 March 2017}}</ref> With an area of {{Convert|26,899|km2|mi2}}, the state has an estimated population of about three million people. It is located between latitude 8°24' N and 10°30' N and longitude 8°32' E and 10°38' E.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Plateau {{!}} state, Nigeria {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Plateau-state-Nigeria |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> The state is named after the Jos Plateau, a mountainous area in the north of the state with rock formations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Online |first=Tribune |date=2017-10-10 |title=SHERE HILLS: Amazing hills and rock formations |url=https://tribuneonlineng.com/shere-hills-amazing-hills-rock-formations/ |access-date=2022-09-04 |website=Tribune Online |language=en-GB}}</ref> Bare rocks are scattered across the [[grassland]]s, which cover the plateau.<ref name="pictda">{{Cite web |last=pictda |title=Welcome!

====Adjacent states====
* [[Bauchi State]]&nbsp;– to the north east for 360&nbsp;km (224 miles), 
* [[Kaduna State]]&nbsp;– to the north west 
* [[Nasarawa State]]&nbsp;– to the south west for 219&nbsp;km (136 miles)
* [[Taraba State]]&nbsp;– to the south east for 202&nbsp;km (126 miles)

===Climate===
Although situated in the [[Tropics|tropical]] zone, the higher altitude gives the state a near-temperate climate, with an average [[temperature]] between 13 and 22&nbsp;°C. [[Harmattan]] winds cause the coldest weather between December and February, with the warmest temperatures usually in the dry season months of March and April. The mean annual rainfall varies between {{convert|1317|mm|0|abbr=on}} in the southern part to {{convert|1460|mm|0|abbr=on}} on the plateau, with the highest rainfall during the [[wet season]] in July and August. The cooler climate has led to a reduced incidence of some [[tropical disease]]s such as [[malaria]]. The Jos Plateau is the source of many rivers in northern Nigeria, including the [[Kaduna River|Kaduna]], [[Gongola River|Gongola]], [[Hadejia River|Hadeja]] and [[Damaturu]] rivers.<ref name="britannica.com">{{Cite web |title=Plateau {{!}} State, Nigeria, and Capital {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Plateau-state-Nigeria |access-date=2023-05-05 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref>

===Geology===
The Jos Plateau is thought to be an area of younger [[granite]] which was intruded through an area of older granite rock, making up the surrounding states. These "younger" granites are thought to be about 160 million years old. This creates the unusual scenery of the Jos Plateau. There are numerous [[hillock]]s with gentle slopes emerging from the ground like mushrooms scattered with huge boulders. Also, volcanic activity 50 million years ago created numerous volcanoes and vast basaltic plateaus formed from lava flows. This also produces regions of mainly narrow and deep valleys and pediments (surfaces made smooth by erosion) from the middle of rounded hills with sheer rock faces.<ref>[http://www.onlinenigeria.com/links/Plateauadv.asp?blurb=461 Nigeria: PHYSICAL SETTING – Plateau State<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The phases of [[Volcano|volcanic]] activities involved in the formation of Plateau State have made it one of the mineral rich states in the country.<ref name="Hodder1959">{{cite journal|last1=Hodder|first1=B.

==History==
[[File:Topaz-169707.jpg|thumb|[[Topaz]] from the [[Jos Plateau]] in Plateau State]]
Plateau state has been adjusted to its present borders many times. Colonial manipulation was from a desire to protect the railway construction and guarantee safe passage of mined tin to the coast. There was also an attempt initially to create a province of largely non-Muslims under one Resident. Later alterations came from strong local desires for [[Self-governance|self-government]].

The [[British Empire|British]] began to exert colonial control of Nigeria in the early 20th century. At that time, much of Plateau State was part of [[Bauchi]] Province. In 1926, Plateau Province, made up of [[Jos]] and [[Pankshin]] Divisions, was carved out of Bauchi.<ref>{{Cite web |last=pictda |title=Welcome! Home{{!}} Plateau State Government Website |url=https://plateaustate.gov.ng/ |access-date=2023-06-19 |website=Laravel |language=en}}</ref> The border changed several times in subsequent years as the government sought not to split ethnic groups. In May 1967, Benue and Plateau Provinces were merged to form the large [[Benue-Plateau State]]. At this time Nigeria had twelve states.<ref name="britannica.com"/>

Following the civil war, Benue-Plateau State was one of several large states which were further split up following pressure on the federal government. Under the military administration of General [[Yakubu Gowon]], the country was further divided into nineteen states in 1976 and Plateau State was created from Benue-Plateau covering the area of the original Plateau Province. In 1996, Plateau State was further subdivided to create [[Nasarawa State]] which was carved out of the western half of Plateau State by [[Sani Abacha]]'s military regime.

[[Tin mining]] activities began in 1902 under the British and continue to the present day.

During the 21st century, there have been several major attacks in Plateau State, including in the capital city of [[Jos]], including riots and bombings by [[Jihadism|jihadist]] [[Boko Haram]] [[Insurgency|insurgents]].
