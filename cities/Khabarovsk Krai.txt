'''Khabarovsk Krai''' ({{langx|ru|Хабаровский край|Khabarovskiy kray}}, {{IPA|ru|xɐˈbarəfskʲɪj kraj|IPA}}) is a [[federal subjects of Russia|federal subject]] (a [[krai]]) of [[Russia]]. It is located in the [[Russian Far East]] and is administratively part of the [[Far Eastern Federal District]]. The [[administrative centre]] of the krai is the [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city]] of [[Khabarovsk]], which is home to roughly half of the krai's population and the largest city in the Russian Far East (just ahead of [[Vladivostok]]). Khabarovsk Krai is the fourth-largest federal subject by area, and had a population of&nbsp;1,343,869 as of 2010.<ref name="2010Census">{{ru-pop-ref|2010Census}}</ref>

Being dominated by the [[Siberian High]] winter cold, the [[continental climate]]s of the krai see extreme freezing for an area adjacent to the sea near the mid-latitudes, but also warm summers in the interior. The southern region lies mostly in the [[drainage basin|basin]] of the lower [[Amur River]], with the [[River mouth|mouth]] of the river located at [[Nikolaevsk-on-Amur]] draining into the [[Strait of Tartary]], which separates Khabarovsk Krai from the island of [[Sakhalin]]. The north occupies a vast mountainous area along the coastline of the [[Sea of Okhotsk]], a [[marginal sea]] of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Khabarovsk Krai is bordered by [[Magadan Oblast]] to the north; [[Amur Oblast]], [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], and the [[Sakha Republic]] to the west; [[Primorsky Krai]] to the south; and [[Sakhalin Oblast]] to the east.

The population consists of mostly ethnic [[Russian people|Russians]], but [[Indigenous peoples of Siberia|indigenous people]] of the area are numerous, such as the [[Tungusic peoples]] ([[Evenks]], [[Negidals]], [[Ulchs]], [[Nani people|Nanai]], [[Oroch people|Oroch]], [[Udege people|Udege]]), Amur [[Nivkh people|Nivkhs]], and [[Ainu in Russia|Ainu]].<ref>Chaussonnet, p.109</ref>

==Geography==
Khabarovsk Krai shares its borders with [[Magadan Oblast]] in the north; with the [[Sakha Republic]] and [[Amur Oblast]] in the west; with the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]], [[China]] ([[Heilongjiang]]), and [[Primorsky Krai]] in the south; and is limited by the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] in the east. In terms of area, it is the fourth-largest federal subject within Russia. Major islands include the [[Shantar Islands]].

[[Taiga]] and [[tundra]] in the north, swampy forest in the central depression, and deciduous forest in the south are the natural vegetation in the area. The main rivers are the [[Amur]], [[Amgun]], [[Uda (Khabarovsk Krai)|Uda]], and [[Tugur (river)|Tugur]], among others. There are also lakes such as [[Bokon]], [[Lake Bolon|Bolon]], [[Chukchagir]], [[Lake Evoron|Evoron]], [[Lake Kizi|Kizi]], [[Khummi]], [[Lake Orel|Orel]], and [[Lake Udyl|Udyl]], among others.<ref name="NAR">[http://mapn53.narod.ru/indexn53.html Topographic map N-53; M 1: 1,000,00]</ref>

Khabarovsk Krai has a severely [[humid continental climate|continental climate]] with its northern areas being [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] with stronger maritime summer moderation in the north. In its southerly areas, especially inland, annual swings are extremely strong, with Khabarovsk itself having hot, wet, and humid summers which rapidly transform into severely cold and long winters, where temperatures hardly ever go above freezing. This is because of the influence of the [[East Asian monsoon]] in summer and the bitterly cold [[Siberian High]] in winter. The second-largest city of [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] has even more violent temperature swings than Khabarovsk, with winter average lows below {{convert|-30|C|F}}, but in spite of this, avoiding being subarctic because of the significant heat in summer.

The main mountain ranges in the region are the [[Bureya Range]], the [[Badzhal Range]] (highest point {{convert|2221|m|ft}} high, the [[Gora Ulun]]), the [[Yam-Alin]], the [[Dusse-Alin]], the [[Sikhote-Alin]], the [[Dzhugdzhur Mountains]], the [[Kondyor Massif]], as well as a small section of the [[Suntar-Khayata Range]], the [[Yudoma-Maya Highlands]], and the [[Sette-Daban]] in the western border regions. The highest point is {{convert|2933|m|ft}} high, [[Berill Mountain]].<ref name="PV">[https://peakvisor.com/adm/khabarovsk-krai.html Khabarovsk Krai Mountains - PeakVisor]</ref><ref name="GЕ">[[Google Earth]]</ref>

There are a number of peninsulas along the krai's extensive coast, the main ones being (north to south) the [[Lisyansky Peninsula]], [[Nurki Peninsula]], [[Tugurskiy Peninsula]], and the [[Tokhareu Peninsula]].

The main islands of Khabarovsk Krai (north to south) are [[Malminskiye Island]], the [[Shantar Islands]], [[Menshikov Island]], [[Reyneke Island (Sea of Okhotsk)]], [[Chkalov Island]], [[Baydukov Island]], and the [[Chastye Islands]]. The island of [[Sakhalin]] (Russia's largest) is administered separately as [[Sakhalin Oblast]], along with the [[Kuril Islands]].

The charts below detail climate averages from various locations in the krai. Khabarovsk is set near the Chinese border at a lower latitude far inland, while Komsomolsk-on-Amur being further downstream on the Amur river at a higher latitude. Sovetskaya Gavan and Okhotsk are coastal settlements in the deep south and far north, respectively.

==History==
According to various Chinese and Korean records, the southern part of Khabarovsk Krai was originally occupied by one of the five semi-nomadic [[Shiwei people|Shiwei]], the Bo Shiwei tribes, and the [[Heishui Mohe|Black Water Mohe]] tribes living, respectively, on the west and the east of the [[Bureya Range|Bureya]] and the [[Lesser Khingan]] ranges.

In 1643, [[Vassili Poyarkov]]'s boats descended the [[Amur River|Amur]], returning to [[Yakutsk]] by the [[Sea of Okhotsk]] and the [[Aldan River]], and in 1649–1650, [[Yerofey Khabarov]] occupied the banks of the Amur. The resistance of the Chinese, however, obliged the [[Cossacks]] to quit their forts, and by the [[Treaty of Nerchinsk]] (1689), Russia abandoned its advance into the basin of the river.

Although the Russians were thus deprived of the right to navigate the Amur River, the territorial claim over the lower courses of the river was not settled in the Treaty of Nerchinsk of 1689.  The area between the [[Uda River (Khabarovsk Krai)|Uda River]] and the [[Greater Khingan]] mountain range (i.e. most of Lower Amuria) was left undemarcated and the Sino-Russian border was allowed to fluctuate.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaforeignrelations.net/node/200 |title=1689, Nerchinsk – Russia |work=China's External Relations }}</ref><ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbbBHsDYpewC&pg=PA107 |title=Russia and China: A Theory of Inter-State Relations|author= Alexei D. Voskressenski |pages=107–108 | publisher=Routledge |year= 2002 |isbn=978-0700714957 }}</ref>

Later in the nineteenth century, [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky|Nikolay Muravyov]] conducted an aggressive policy with China by claiming that the lower reaches of the Amur River belonged to [[Russian Empire|Russia]]. In 1852, a Russian military expedition under Muravyov explored the Amur, and by 1857, a chain of Russian Cossacks and peasants had been settled along the whole course of the river. In 1858, in the [[Treaty of Aigun]], China recognized the Amur River downstream as far as the [[Ussuri River]] as the boundary between Russia and the Qing Empire, and granted Russia free access to the Pacific Ocean.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chinaforeignrelations.net/node/204 |title =1858, Aigun – Russia |work=China's External Relations}}</ref>  The Sino-Russian border was later further delineated in the [[Treaty of Peking]] of 1860 when the [[Ussuri River|Ussuri]] Territory (the [[Primorsky Krai|Maritime Territory]]), which was previously a joint possession, became Russian.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rbbBHsDYpewC&pg=PA113 |title=Russia and China: A Theory of Inter-State Relations|author= Alexei D.

Khabarovsk Krai was established on 20 October 1938, when the [[Far Eastern Krai]] was split into the Khabarovsk and [[Primorsky Krai]]s.<ref name="Established">Decree of October&nbsp;20, 1938</ref> [[Kamchatka Oblast]], which was originally subordinated to the Far Eastern Krai, fell under the Jurisdiction of Khabarovsk Krai, along with its two National Okrugs, [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]] and [[Koryak Okrug|Koryak]]. In 1947, the northern part of Sakhalin was removed from the Krai to join the southern part and form [[Sakhalin oblast|Sakhalin Oblast]]. In 1948, parts of its southwestern territories were removed from the Krai to form [[Amur Oblast]]. In 1953, [[Magadan Oblast]] was established from the northern parts of the Krai and was given jurisdiction over Chukotka National Okrug, which was originally under the jurisdiction of Kamchatka oblast. In 1956, Kamchatka Oblast became its own region and took Koryak National Okrug with it. The Krai took its modern form in 1991, just before the [[Soviet Union|USSR's]] collapse when the [[Jewish Autonomous Oblast]] was separated from its jurisdiction and made into a direct federal subject of Russia. On 24 April 1996, Khabarovsk signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy.<ref name= "asymmetries">{{Cite journal |last=Solnick |first=Steven |date=29 May 1996 |title=Asymmetries in Russian Federation Bargaining |url=https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1996-810-08-Solnick.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/nceeer/1996-810-08-Solnick.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |journal=The National Council for Soviet and East European Research |page=12}}</ref> This agreement would be abolished on 12 August 2002.<ref name= "demokratiztsiya">{{Cite journal|last=Chuman|first=Mizuki|title=The Rise and Fall of Power-Sharing Treaties Between Center and Regions in Post-Soviet Russia |url=http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://demokratizatsiya.pub/archives/19_2_L7H017206G216817.pdf |archive-date=2022-10-09 |url-status=live |journal=Demokratizatsiya |page=146}}</ref>

==Administrative divisions==
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Khabarovsk Krai}}

==Politics==
[[File:Здание администрации Хабаровского края.JPG|thumb|Khabarovsk Krai Administration building]]

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Khabarovsk CPSU Committee (who, in reality, had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor, was appointed/elected alongside elected [[Regional parliaments of Russia|regional parliament]].

The Charter of Khabarovsk Krai is the fundamental law of the krai. The [[Legislative Duma of Khabarovsk Krai]] is the [[regional parliaments of Russia|regional]] standing legislative (representative) body. The Legislative Duma exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Krai Government, which includes territorial executive bodies, such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Krai Administration supports the activities of the [[Governor of Khabarovsk Krai|Governor]], who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the Charter in accordance with the [[Constitution of Russia]].

On 9 July 2020, the governor of the region, [[Sergei Furgal]], was arrested and flown to Moscow. The [[2020 Khabarovsk Krai protests]] began on 11 July 2020, in support of Furgal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Anger at Kremlin Grows in Latest Massive Russian Far East Protest |url=https://www.themoscowtimes.com/2020/07/25/mass-anti-kremlin-rallies-grip-russias-far-east-a70977 |work=The Moscow Times |date=25 July 2020}}</ref>

==Economy==
[[File:Amur bridge in Khabarovsk.jpg|thumb|Bridge over the Amur River in Khabarovsk]]
Khabarovsk Krai is the most industrialized territory of the Far East of Russia, producing 30% of the total industrial products in the Far Eastern Economic Region.

===Heavy industry===
The machine construction industry consists primarily of a highly developed [[military–industrial complex]] of large-scale aircraft- and shipbuilding enterprises.<ref name="globalsecurity">{{Cite web|url=https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/russia/knaapo.htm|title=KNAAPO Komsomolsk na Amure Aviation Industrial Association named after Gagarin - Russian|website=www.globalsecurity.org}}</ref> The [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association]] is currently among the krai's most successful enterprises, and for years has been the largest taxpayer of the territory.<ref name="globalsecurity"/> Other major industries include timber-working and [[fishing]], along with [[metallurgy]] in the main cities. [[Komsomolsk-on-Amur]] is the iron and steel centre of the Far East; a [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]] from northern [[Sakhalin]] supplies the petroleum-refining industry in the city of [[Khabarovsk]]. In the Amur basin, there is also some cultivation of [[wheat]] and [[soybean]]s. The [[administrative centre]], Khabarovsk, is at the junction of the Amur River and the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].

===Mining===
The region's [[mineral]] resources are relatively underdeveloped. Khabarovsk Krai contains large gold mining operations (Highland Gold, Polus Gold), a major but low-grade copper deposit being explored by [http://www.eurasianminerals.com/s/strategic-investments.asp?ReportID=620472 IG Integro Group], and a world-class tin district which was a major contributor to the Soviet industrial complex and is currently being revitalised by Far Eastern Tin (Festivalnoye mine) and by [http://www.tinresources.com Sable Tin Resources] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170313220157/http://tinresources.com/ |date=March 13, 2017 }}, which is developing the [[Sable Tin Deposit (Sobolinoye)]], a large high-grade deposit, 25&nbsp;km from [[Solnechny District|Solnechny town.]]
