The [[Thesaban#City-municipality|city municipality]] of Chiang Mai (''thesaban nakhon'') officially only covers parts (40,2&nbsp;km²) of the [[Mueang Chiang Mai district]] in the city centre and has a population of 127,000.<ref name=":4" /> This census area dates back to 1983 when Chiang Mai's municipal area was enlarged for the first and last time since becoming the first City Municipality in Thailand (then under [[Thailand|Siam]]) in 1935. The city's sprawl has since extended into several neighboring districts, namely [[Hang Dong district|Hang Dong]] in the south, [[Mae Rim district|Mae Rim]] in the north, [[Suthep]] in the west and [[San Kamphaeng district|San Kamphaeng]] in the east, forming the Chiang Mai [[urban area]] with over a million residents.

The city municipality is subdivided into four ''[[khwaeng]]'' ([[Ward (electoral subdivision)|electoral wards]]): Nakhon Ping, Sriwichai, Mengrai, and Kawila. The first three are on the west bank of the Ping River, and Kawila is on the east bank. Nakhon Ping District includes the northern part of the city. Sriwichai, Mengrai, and Kawila consist of the western, southern, and eastern parts, respectively. The city center—within the city walls—is mostly within Sriwichai ward.<ref name="Wards">{{cite web|url=http://www.cmcity.go.th/aboutus/map.php |title=Chiang Mai Municipality |year=2008 |publisher=Chiang Mai City |language=th |access-date=2008-10-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915212133/http://www.cmcity.go.th/aboutus/map.php |archive-date=September 15, 2008 }}</ref>

=== Population ===
{{Further|List of municipalities in Thailand}}
Following the municipal city area's enlargement to 40,2&nbsp;km² in 1983, no changes or updates have been made to it, even with the population increasing substantially in the years after.<ref name=":2" /> In 1983, Chiang Mai's urban area, with a population of 127,000, already exceeded the municipal city limits, and has grown to over one million people in 2022.<ref name=":1" />

Chiang Mai Municipality has now become a small part of the current city-scape, making up only most parts of the capital district [[Mueang Chiang Mai district|Amphoe Mueang Chiang Mai]] in the inner city. To reflect the city's growth beyond the municipal borders, official government documents by the [https://www.chiangmaipao.go.th/en/about_chiangmai.php Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization] and the [https://onedptgis.dpt.go.th/onedpt-complain-ppl/ Department of Public Works and Town & Country Planning] - published in the [[Royal Thai Government Gazette]] - regularly update and outline the current city boundaries. The first revision of such a updated urban area ({{langx|th|เขตเมือง}}) was published in 1989, with the second one following in 1999. The third revision from 2012 expands the old municipal city border inside [[Mueang Chiang Mai district|Muaeng Chiang Mai district]] to [[Mae Rim district|Mae Rim]] in the north, [[San Kamphaeng district|San Kamphaeng]] and [[Doi Saket district|Doi Saket]] in the east, [[Hang Dong district|Hang Dong]] and [[Saraphi district|Saraphi]] in the south, and [[Suthep]] in the west.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |last=Chiang Mai Provincial Administrative Organization |first=Royal Gazette |date=May 21, 2013 |title=Ministerial Regulations that shall be incorporated into the Chiang Mai unified city plan, Page 32 (in Thai) |url=https://download.asa.or.th/03media/04law/cpa/mr56-cm.pdf}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |first= |title=Ministerial Regulations to enforce the City plan, Chiang Mai Province (No. 2) B.E. 2559 - Regarding the official city plans by the Chiang Mai Provincial Administration |url=https://www.ratchakitcha.soc.go.th/DATA/PDF/2560/A/001/14.PDF |website=Royal Gazette}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Chapter 3 - Current environmental resources, Khon Kaen University, Feasibility study on Condominiums in the Chiang Mai Urban Area, Page 16+18 |url=http://eiadoc.onep.go.th/eialibrary/4housing/55/The%20scene%20condominium/CH3/CH_3_P1.pdf}}</ref> This new extent, with a size of 405&nbsp;km², serves as Chiang Mai's principal city border and [[Urban area|urban]] area.

The urban area has a combined population of 1,198,000 residents, making Chiang Mai the second largest city in Thailand after [[Bangkok]] (10.7 million people) and twice as big as the third largest city [[Nakhon Ratchasima]] (Estimate: 500,000 people).<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":4" /> As neither the '''Department of Local Administration''' (DLA) nor the '''National Statistics Office''' (NSO) count expatriates, non-permanent residents, migrant workers (except [[ASEAN]] migrants for the year 2017) and citizens from other [[Provinces of Thailand|Thai provinces]] living and renting in Chiang Mai in their official population figures, it is estimated that the real population figure for Chiang Mai could be as high as 1.5 million.<mapframe latitude="18.795168" longitude="98.998489" zoom="10" width="324" height="247" align="center" text="Chiang Mai Municipality (Dark Grey, Area 40.2 km²) within the Chiang Mai Urban Area (Light Grey, Area 405 km²) as defined by the Provincial Administrative Organisation and the Ministry of Interior.">

</mapframe>As of 2022, a fourth revision of Chiang Mai's urban area is under way and currently up for debate by the public. Proposals show the expansion of the current urban area into more adjacent [[Tambon|subdistricts]] and large forest areas, especially around [[Doi Suthep]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gathering opinions to create a 4th Revision of the Chiang Mai City Plan |url=https://www.chiangmainews.co.th/social/1905734/ |website=Chiangmai News (In Thai)|date=21 January 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Department of Public Works and Town & Country Planning - City Plan, Chiang Mai (4th Revision) |url=https://onedptgis.dpt.go.th/onedpt-complain-ppl/announce/15/10568}}</ref>

Since Thailand's outdated census methods prevent the determination of official metropolitan areas outside of Bangkok, presently there are no official sources indicating how large the extended [[metropolitan area]] is.

== Geography ==
Chiang Mai Municipality covers an area of 40.2 square kilometres (15.52 sq mi), while the urban city covers an area of 405 square kilometres (156.371 sq mi).<ref name=":2" /><ref name=":3" /> The city's [[Urban sprawl|sprawl]] reaches into six neighboring districts: [[Mae Rim district|Mae Rim]], [[Doi Saket district|Doi Saket]], [[San Kamphaeng district|San Kamphaeng]], [[Hang Dong district|Hang Dong]], [[Saraphi district|Saraphi]] and [[Suthep]]. Chiang Mai is the [[List of municipalities in Thailand#Largest cities by urban population|only city outside Bangkok]] to reach into other districts.

The city is situated in a valley on a river basin in the [[Thai highlands]] and is on average at 300&nbsp;m (1,000&nbsp;ft) elevation. Chiang Mai's city centre sits west of the [[Ping River]], a tributary to the [[Chao Phraya River]], while the city's sprawl extends north-west, south-west, north-east and east of the river. To the west side of Chiang Mai lies the [[Thanon Thong Chai Range|Thanon Thong Chai Mountain Range]], with one major peak, [[Doi Suthep|Doi Suthep mountain]], prominently rising above the city with an elevation of 1,676 metres (5,499&nbsp;ft).

=== Parks and green spaces ===
There are several parks and green spaces inside the city. [[Buak Hat Park|Buak Hat Public Park]], located in the south west corner of the old city is the most frequented public park in Chiang Mai. Directly opposite, to the south-west, is Kanchanaphisek Park, a park with remnants of the old extended city walls. Bigger parks include Lanna Rama 9 Park to the north in [[Chang Phueak, Chiang Mai|Chang Phueak]] district and Ang Keaw Reservoir, located near the northern entrance to [[Chiang Mai University]]. As of 2024, there are plans to reopen the Chiang Mai Railway Park opposite of the central train station.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ward |first=Ricky |title=Chiang Mai Railway Park Bulldozed - OurChiangMai.com |url=https://ourchiangmai.com/2024/06/09/railway-park-bulldozed/ |access-date=2024-06-27 |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Chiang Mai has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Aw''), tempered by the low latitude and moderate elevation, with warm to hot weather year-round, though nighttime conditions during the dry season can be cool and much lower than daytime highs. The maximum temperature ever recorded was {{convert|42.5|°C|1}} in May 2016. Cold and hot weather effects occur immediately but cold effects last longer than hot effects and contribute to higher cold related mortality risk among old people aged more than 85 years.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Effects of temperature on mortality in Chiang Mai city, Thailand: A time series study|author=Yuming Guo, Kornwipa Punnasiri and Shilu Tongly|journal=Environmental Health|volume=11|pages=36|date=9 July 2012|issue=1 |doi=10.1186/1476-069X-11-36|pmid=22613086|pmc=3391976 |doi-access=free |bibcode=2012EnvHe..11...36G }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>{{Weather box

== Government ==
The Administration of Chiang Mai Municipality is responsible for an area that covers approximately 40.216 square kilometers and consists of 4 Municipal Districts, 14 sub-districts, 94 municipal communities, and  89,656 households.<ref name="TDD" />

According to Municipal Act B.E. 2496 (1953, reviewed in 2003), the duties of the Municipality cover a lot of areas which include clean water supply, waste and sewage disposal, communicable disease control, public training and education, public hospitals and electricity, etc.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cmcity.go.th/|title=Chiang Mai Municipality}}</ref>

The mayor, or the highest executive, is directly elected by the eligible voters in the municipal area. The mayor serves a four-year term and is assisted by no more than four deputy mayors appointed directly by the mayor.

The current mayor is Tussanai Burabupakorn, as of June 2018.<ref name=":0" />

The Municipal Council is the legislative body of the municipality. It has the power to issue ordinances by laws that do not contradict with the laws of the country. The municipal council applies to all people living in the municipal area. The Chiang Mai City Municipal Council is composed of 24 elected members from 4 municipal districts who each serves a 4-year term.<ref name=":0" />

=== Development initiatives ===
In February 2017, the Digital Economy Promotion Agency (DEPA) (under Thailand's Digital Economy and Society Ministry) announced that 36.5 million baht would be invested into developing Chiang Mai into an innovation-driven "smart city". Chiang Mai was the second city in Thailand, after Phuket and along with Khon Kaen,<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/news/business/EconomyAndTourism/30305038|title=DE Ministry pushing for nationwide|work=The Nation|first=Jirapan|last=Boonnoon|date=2017-01-27|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> to be developed using the "smart city" model. The model aims to capture and populate multiple levels of information (including building, social, environmental, governmental, and economic data) from sources like sensors, real-time traffic information, and social forums for access by managers, governments, and citizens using mobile apps, tablets, and dashboards.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/Startup_and_IT/30327378|title=Prayut gets long-distance look at 'smart' 3D Chiang Mai|work=The Nation|date=22 September 2017|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> The "Smart City" outlook (integrating Information and Communications Technology (ICT) with the Internet of Things (IOT)), is viewed to be critical both for secondary cities with burgeoning urban population like Chiang Mai,<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Da Hsuan|first1=Feng|last2=Hai Ming|first2=Liang|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/detail/opinion/30327874|title=Thailand can be smart-city flagship for Belt and Road|work=The Nation|date=28 September 2017|access-date=2018-03-01|format=Editorial}}</ref> as well as part of Thailand's move to be digital hub of ASEAN.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/national/Plan-to-make-Phuket-and-Chiang-Mai-smart-cities-30268781.html|author=Asina Pornwasin|title=Plan to make Phuket and Chiang Mai 'smart cities'|work=The Nation|date=15 September 2015|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> The role of private sector investment, together with public sector partnership, is key to promote digital entrepreneurship.

It is aimed to both increase the size of Chiang Mai's digital workforce, as well as attract foreign digital talent to Chiang Mai.<ref name="BP-20170211" />

==== Smart transportation ====
In January 2018, it was announced that Chiang Mai would be launching "Mobike In", a bike-sharing app that would see the introduction of some 500 smart bikes on the streets. The smart bikes would be available for use for both locals and tourists. It is reported that as a start, the bikes would be placed at convenient locations including the Three Kings monument, Tha Pae Gate and Suan Buak Haad Park, as well as in the old town. The "Mobike In" project is sponsored by [[Advanced Info Service]] (Thailand's largest mobile phone operator), in collaboration with the  [[Tourism Authority of Thailand]] (Chiang Mai Office), together with local universities, public and private sectors. The project aims to promote non-motorised transportation and support eco-tourism. Speaking at the launch at the Lanna Folklife Museum, Deputy Governor Puttipong Sirimart stated that the introduction of such "smart transportation" was a positive move in Chiang Mai's transformation into a "Smart City" (part of the "Thailand 4.0" vision).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chiangmaicitylife.com/news/chiang-mai-get-500-smart-bikes-known-mobike/|title=Chiang Mai To Get 500 Smart Bikes, Known as MOBIKE IN|website=Citylife Chiang Mai|date=2018-01-19|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>

==== Smart agriculture ====
DEPA has also provided funding to Chiang Mai's [[Maejo University]], to develop wireless sensor systems for better farmland irrigation techniques, to reduce use of water sprinklers and increase productivity. The university is also developing agricultural drones that can spray fertilizers and pesticides on crops which, if successful, will result in lower costs. The drones may also detect and monitor fires and smoke pollution.<ref name="BP-20170211" />

Under the 2011 IBM "Smarter Cities Challenge", IBM experts recommended smarter food initiatives focused on creating agricultural data for farmers, including price modelling, farmer-focused weather forecasting tools, an e-portal to help farmers align crop production with demand, as well as branding of Chiang Mai produce. Longer-term recommendations included implementing traceability, enabling the tracking of produce from farm to consumer, smarter irrigation as well as flood control and early warning systems.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://prd-ibm-smarter-cities-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/applications/chiang-mai-thailand-summary-2011.pdf|title=Chiang Mai Summary Report|publisher=IBM Smarter Cities Challenge|date=2011|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>

==== Smart healthcare ====
As part of the smart city project supported by IBM, Chiang Mai is also looking to use technology to boost its presence as a medical tourism hub. In 2011, IBM launched its Smarter Cities Challenge, a three-year, 100 city, 1.6 billion baht (US$50 million) program where teams of experts study and make detailed recommendations to address local important urban issues. Chiang Mai won a grant of about US$400,000 in 2011. The IBM team focused on smarter healthcare initiatives, aimed at making Chiang Mai and the University Medical Clinic a medical hub,<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Sambandaraksa|first1=Don|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/world-updates/197580/ibm-focuses-on-chiang-mai|title=IBM focuses on Chiang Mai|work=Bangkok Post|date=22 September 2010|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref><!--dated reference--> as well as improving efficiency of hospitals for improved service delivery. For example, healthcare providers could use real-time location tracking of patients and hospital assets to increase efficiency and build an internationally recognised service identity. Electronic medical record technology can also be adopted to standardise information exchanges to link all medical service providers, even including traditional medicine and spas.<ref name="IMTJ-20110602" /> Similar ideas include linking patient databases and healthcare asset information.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Leesa-Nguansuk|first1=Suchit|url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/local-news/1049621/a-tale-of-smart-cities|title=A tale of smart cities|work=Bangkok Post|date=1 August 2016|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> In partnership with the Faculty of Medicine at Chiang Mai University, the team of experts aim to enhance the quality of medical care available to the community, both urban and rural, as well as develop Chiang Mai into a centre for medical tourism with the infrastructure for supporting international visitors seeking long-term medical care.<ref>{{Cite news|last1=Boonnoon|first1=Jirapan|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/business/Thai-arm-of-IBM-spreads-wings-in-Laos-30186495.html|title=Thai arm of IBM spreads wings in Laos|work=The Nation|date=19 July 2012|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>

As the largest city in northern Thailand, Chiang Mai already receives some long stay healthcare visitors, largely Japanese. Its main advantage over Bangkok is lower costs of living. Quality services at low prices are a major selling point in mainstream healthcare, dental and ophthalmologic care as well as Thai traditional medicine. Its local university is also developing specializations in robotic surgery and geriatric medicine to accommodate a future aging population.<ref name="IMTJ-20110602">{{Cite web|url=https://www.imtj.com/news/smarter-technology-medical-tourism-thailand/|title=Smarter technology: medical tourism in Thailand|website=International Medical Travel Journal (IMTJ)|date=2 June 2011|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>

DEPA also reported that it has developed a mobile app that uses augmented reality technology to showcase various historical attractions in Chiang Mai, in line with the government's policy to promote Chiang Mai as a world heritage city.<ref name="BP-20170211">{{Cite news| url=https://www.bangkokpost.com/tech/local-news/1196657/chiang-mai-to-become-smart-city|title=Chiang Mai to become smart city|last=Leesa-Nguansuk|first=Suchit|work=Bangkok Post|date=11 February 2017|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>

* Wat RamPoeng (Tapotaram), near Wat U-Mong, is known for its meditation center (Northern Insight Meditation Center). The temple teaches the traditional [[vipassanā]] technique and students stay from 10 days to more than a month as they try to meditate at least 10 hours a day. Wat RamPoeng houses the largest collection of ''Tipitaka'', the complete Theravada canon, in several Northern dialects.<ref>"Wat Rampoeng Tapotharam" in Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David, ''Ancient Chiang Mai'', Volume 3.

Chiang Mai has several museums regarding Art and Lanna culture within its city limits:

* Chiang Mai City Arts and Cultural Center
* [[Chiang Mai National Museum]], which highlights the history of the region and the Kingdom of [[Lan Na]].
* Chiang Mai Philatelic Museum, showing the history of postage stamps and postal development of Thailand, especially of Chiang Mai.<ref>Museums of Thailand website https://www.museumthailand.com/en/museum/Chiangmai-Philatelic-Museum-2</ref>

* Mint Bureau of Chiang Mai or Sala Thanarak, Treasury Department, Ministry of Finance, Rajdamnern Road (one block from AUA Language Center).  Has an old coin museum open to the public during business hours. The Lan Na Kingdom used leaf (or line) money made of brass and silver bubbles, also called "pig-mouth"  money. The exact original technique of making pig-mouth money is still disputed, and because the silver is very thin and breakable, good pieces are now very rare.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.royalthaimint.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=160%3Athai-coins-history&catid=44%3A2010-03-27-17-09-13&Itemid=117&lang=en |title=Thai Coins History |access-date=19 Sep 2011 |date=28 Mar 2010 |publisher=Royal Thai Mint |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402155914/http://www.royalthaimint.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=160%3Athai-coins-history&catid=44%3A2010-03-27-17-09-13&Itemid=117&lang=en |archive-date=April 2, 2012 }}</ref>

=== Effects of tourism ===
[[File:Chiang mai.jpg|thumb|City wall, north-west corner]]

The influx of tourists has put a strain on the city's natural resources. Faced with rampant unplanned development, air and water pollution, waste management problems, and traffic congestion, the city has launched a non-motorised transport (NMT) system. The initiative, developed by a partnership of experts and with support from the [[Climate & Development Knowledge Network]], aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and create employment opportunities for the urban poor. The climate compatible development strategy has gained support from policy-makers and citizens alike.<ref name="CDKN">{{cite web |title=Catalysing sustainable tourism: The case of Chiang Mai, Thailand |url=https://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/CDKN_InsideStory-ChiangMai_final_web-res-revised.pdf| last1=Kusakabe| first1=Kyoko| last2=Shrestha| first2=Pujan| last3=Kumar| first3=S| last4=Suwanprik| first4=Trinnawat| publisher=Climate & Development Climate Network (CDKN)| access-date=21 June 2018| date=May 2014}}</ref>

Tourism has also brought benefits for the local community of Chiang Mai. It has played a role in promoting the arts and crafts market in Chiang Mai. Tourists have increased demand for traditional crafts and art forms that has resulted in the incentives for local artists to enhance their work thus adding to the sector.<ref>{{cite book |title=Managing Intermediate Size Cities: Sustainable Development in a Growth Region of Thailand |author=Michael Romanos & Christopher Auffrey |publisher=Springer Science|pages= 127–151|date= 2002}}</ref> There are also opportunities for agritourism in Chiang Mai. The factor analysis illustrates three types of agri needs, activities and shopping, facilities, services and location and the last one attractions and environment. Agritoursim is a type of business that a farmer conducts for additional farm income. Farmers, through the promotions of agricultural products, provide enjoyment and educate the public about farming and agriculture.<ref>{{cite news|title= Agritourist Needs and Motivations: The Chiang Mai Case|author= Natthawut Srikatanyoo &Kom Campiranon |publisher= Journal of Travel & Tourism Marketing, 27:2, 166-178, DOI: 10.1080/10548400903579795|date= 11 March 2010}}</ref>

Since 2022, due to the increasingly harsh political environment in China, Chiang Mai attracts many Chinese to settle and live in the city due to its liberal climate and low cost of living.<ref>[https://archive.today/20240209110139/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2024/02/09/china-thailand-chiang-mai-political-freedom/ Thai haven draws Chinese tech bros, moms and stoners seeking freedom]</ref>

=== Festivals ===

* [[Loi Krathong]] (along with Yi Peng), held on the full moon of the 12th month of the traditional [[Thai lunar calendar]], being the full moon of the second month of the old Lanna calendar. In the Western calendar this usually falls in November. Every year thousands of people assemble floating banana-leaf containers (''krathong'') decorated with flowers and candles and deposit them on the waterways of the city in worship of the Goddess of Water. Lanna-style [[sky lantern]]s (''khom fai'' or ''kom loi''), which are hot-air balloons made of paper, are launched into the air. These sky lanterns are believed to help rid the locals of troubles and are also used to decorate houses and streets.
* [[Songkran (Thailand)|''Songkran'']] is held in mid-April to celebrate the traditional Thai New Year. Chiang Mai has become one of the most popular locations to visit during this festival. A variety of religious and fun-related activities (notably the indiscriminate citywide water fight) take place each year, along with parades and Miss Songkran beauty competition.
* [[Chiang Mai Flower Festival]] is a three-day festival held during the first weekend in February each year; this event occurs when Chiang Mai's temperate and tropical flowers are in full bloom.
* Tam Bun Khan Dok, the [[Inthakhin (pillar)|Inthakhin]] (City Pillar) Festival, starts on the day of the waning moon of the sixth lunar month and lasts 6–8 days.

Buddhist celebrations include the [[Vesak]] at Doi Suthep mountain where thousands of Buddhists make the journey on foot after sunset, from the bottom of the mountain to the temple at the top Wat Doi Suthep.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CityNews|title=Visakha Bucha Day this Friday - Chiang Mai CityNews|url=http://www.chiangmaicitylife.com/news/visakha-bucha-day-friday/|access-date=2021-05-03|website=Chiang Mai Citylife|date=19 May 2016 }}</ref> [[Māgha Pūjā|Makha Bucha Day]] is celebrated at large temples (Wat Phra Singh, Wat Chedi Luang, Wat Phra That Doi Suthep, and Wat Sri Soda) with thousands of attendees.<ref>{{Cite web|last=CityNews|title=Thousands Celebrate Makha Bhucha Day in Chiang Mai - Chiang Mai CityNews|url=http://www.chiangmaicitylife.com/news/thousands-celebrate-makha-bhucha-day-chiang-mai/|access-date=2021-05-03|website=Chiang Mai Citylife|date=23 February 2016 }}</ref>

=== Language ===
While most inhabitants speak [[Thai language|Thai]], there are many older inhabitants that also speak the former Lan Na Kingdom's unique language known as [[Northern Thai language|Northern Thai]], ''Lanna'' or ''Kham Mueang''. The script used to write this language, called the [[Tai Tham alphabet]], is studied only by scholars, and the language is commonly written with the standard [[Thai alphabet]].<ref>See: Forbes, Andrew, "The Peoples of Chiang Mai", in Hans Penth and Andrew Forbes ''A Brief History of Lan Na'' Chiang Mai City Arts and Cultural Centre 2004 pp 221-256</ref>

== Health and Education ==

=== Education ===
{{Further|List of international schools in Thailand|List of universities and colleges in Thailand}}
Chiang Mai has several universities, including [[Chiang Mai University]], [[Chiang Mai Rajabhat University]], [[Rajamangala University of Technology Lanna]], [[Payap University]], Far Eastern University, and [[Maejo University]], as well as numerous technical and teacher colleges.

The city is also home to 16 international schools, the second highest amount in the country after Bangkok.<ref>{{Cite web |title=List of International Schools in Thailand - 164 schools |url=https://www.international-schools-database.com/country/thailand |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=www.international-schools-database.com |language=en}}</ref>

Chiang Mai University, the city's main and most important institution, was the first government university established outside of Bangkok in the year 1964. As of 2024, Chiang Mai University holds the rank of the third best university in Thailand behind [[Chulalongkorn University|Chulalongkorn]] and [[Mahidol University|Mahidol]] University.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017-02-16 |title=Study in Thailand {{!}} THE World University Rankings |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/student/where-to-study/study-in-thailand |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=Times Higher Education (THE) |language=en}}</ref>

=== Healthcare ===
The largest hospital in Chiang Mai City is [[Maharaj Nakorn Chiang Mai Hospital]], run by the [[Faculty of Medicine, Chiang Mai University]]. The [[Ministry of Public Health (Thailand)|Ministry of Public Health]] does not operate any hospitals in Chiang Mai Municipality, with the closest one being [[Nakornping Hospital]], a regional hospital in Mae Rim District and the MOPH's largest hospital in the province.

== Air pollution ==
A continuing environmental issue in Chiang Mai is the incidence of [[air pollution]] that primarily occurs every year between December and April. In 1996, speaking at the Fourth International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement conference—held in Chiang Mai that year—the Governor Virachai Naewboonien invited guest speaker Dr. Jakapan Wongburanawatt, Dean of the Social Science Faculty of [[Chiang Mai University]], to discuss air pollution efforts in the region. Dr. Wongburanawatt stated that, in 1994, an increasing number of city residents attended hospitals suffering from respiratory problems associated with the city's air pollution.<ref>"Chiang Mai's Environmental Challenges", Fourth International Conference of Environmental Compliance and Enforcement</ref>

During the December–April period, air quality in Chiang Mai often remains below recommended standards, with fine-particle dust levels reaching twice the standard limits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.earthoria.com/air-pollution-levels-in-chiang-mai-rising.html |title=Air Pollution in Chiang Mai: Current Air Quality & PM-10 Levels |publisher=Earthoria |date=2008-02-27 |access-date=2010-04-15}}</ref> It has been said that smoke pollution has made March "the worst month to visit Chiang Mai".<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.siamandbeyond.com/smoke-pollution-makes-march-the-worst-month-to-visit-chiang-mai-northern-thailand/ |title=Smoke Pollution Makes March the Worst Month to Visit Chiang Mai and Northern Thailand - Siam and Beyond |access-date=2015-03-20 |archive-date=2015-03-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314005202/http://siamandbeyond.com/smoke-pollution-makes-march-the-worst-month-to-visit-chiang-mai-northern-thailand/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

To address the increasing amount of [[#Transportation|greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector]] in Chiang Mai, the city government has advocated the use of non-motorised transport (NMT). In addition to its potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the NMT initiative addresses other issues such as traffic congestion, air quality, income generation for the poor, and the long-term viability of the tourism industry.<ref name="CDKN"/>

== National Parks ==
[[File:Nam tok huai kaeo 04 lower reaches rainy season.JPG|thumb|''Nam Tok Huai Kaeo'' lies at the foot of Doi Suthep on the western edge of the city|326x326px]]
National Parks include [[Doi Inthanon National Park]], which includes [[Doi Inthanon]], the highest mountain in Thailand, and one of the most popular national parks in the country. It is famous for its waterfalls, few trails, remote villages, viewpoints, sunrise/sunset watching, bird watching, and the all year round cold weather on higher elevations.

=== Doi Suthep-Pui National Park ===
[[Doi Suthep–Pui National Park]] begins on the western edge of the city. Wat Doi Suthep Buddhist temple, located near the summit of [[Doi Suthep]], can be seen from much of the city and its environs. In 2015, a development plan around the temple for a new housing project threatened to destroy some of the forest, but was halted, resulting in reforestation of the park.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Housing project in Doi Suthep mountains, Thailand |url=https://ejatlas.org/conflict/doi-suthep |access-date=2022-04-24 |publisher=Environmental Justice Atlas}}</ref>

=== Pha Daeng National Park ===
[[Pha Daeng National Park]], also known as ''Chiang Dao National Park'', includes [[Doi Chiang Dao]] and [[Pha Deang]] mountain near the border with [[Myanmar]]. Many tour companies offer organized treks among the local hills and forests on foot and on elephant back. Most also involve visits to various local hill tribes, including the [[Akha people|Akha]], [[Hmong people|Hmong]], [[Karen people|Karen]], and [[Lisu people|Lisu]].<ref>"Chiang Mai's Hill Peoples", in Forbes, Andrew, and Henley, David, ''Ancient Chiang Mai'', Volume 3.

== Transport ==

=== Roads ===
[[File:Intravarorot road sign.jpg|thumb|Road sign decorated with [[Doi Suthep]]|220x220px]]As population density continues to grow, greater pressure is placed upon the city's transportation system. During peak hours, the road traffic is often badly congested. The city officials as well as researchers and experts have been trying to find feasible solutions to tackle the city's traffic problems. Most of them agree that factors such as lack of public transport, increasing number of motor vehicles, inefficient land use plan and urban sprawl, have led to these problems.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Peraphan|first1=Jittrapirom|last2=Hermann|first2=Knoflacher|last3=Markus|first3=Mailer|date=2017-01-01|title=Understanding decision makers' perceptions of Chiang Mai city's transport problems an application of Causal Loop Diagram (CLD) methodology|journal=Transportation Research Procedia|series=World Conference on Transport Research - WCTR 2016 Shanghai. 10–15 July 2016|volume=25|issue=Supplement C|pages=4438–4453|doi=10.1016/j.trpro.2017.05.350|doi-access=free|hdl=2066/230529|hdl-access=free}}</ref> The locally preferred form of transport is personal motorbike and, increasingly, private car.

A number of bus stations link the city to central, southeast, and northern Thailand. The central Chang Puak Terminal (north of Chiang Puak Gate) provides local services within Chiang Mai Province. The Chiang Mai Arcade bus terminal northeast of the city centre (which can be reached with a [[songthaew]] or tuk-tuk ride) provides services to over 20 other destinations in Thailand including Bangkok, Pattaya, Hua Hin, and Phuket. There are several services a day from Chiang Mai Arcade terminal to Mo Chit Station in Bangkok (a 10- to 12-hour journey).

Since December 2023, Chiang Mai offers a city wide bus system under the name RTC Chiang Mai City Bus, with three established lines starting and terminating at Chiang Mai Airport.<ref>{{Cite web |title=RTC – Chiang Mai City Bus |url=https://rtc-citybus.com/ |access-date=2024-06-27 |website=rtc-citybus.com}}</ref>

=== Rail systems ===
[[File:Chiang Mai Station 20230215-1.jpg|thumb|Chiang Mai Railway Station]]
The state railway operates 10 trains a day to [[Chiang Mai railway station]] from [[Bangkok railway station|Bangkok]]. Most journeys run overnight and take approximately 12–15 hours. Most trains offer first-class (private cabins) and second-class (seats fold out to make sleeping berths) service. Chiang Mai is the northern terminus of the Thai railway system.

The latest development is that Mass Rapid Transit Authority of Thailand (MRTA) has approved a draft decree on the [[Chiang Mai light rail transit|light railway transit]] system project in Chiang Mai. The construction was set to begin in 2020 and be completed by 2027.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chiangmaicitylife.com/news/chiang-mai-light-rail-transit-2027/|title=Chiang Mai to Have Light Rail Transit by 2027|website=Chiang Mai Citylife|date=27 November 2018}}</ref> It is believed that such a system would mitigate Chiang Mai's traffic problems to a large degree.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://movingnomads.com/web/city/Chiang%20Mai.html|title=Chiang Mai for Digital Nomads|website=Moving Nomads|access-date=2018-02-06|archive-date=2018-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206131700/http://movingnomads.com/web/city/Chiang%20Mai.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>
