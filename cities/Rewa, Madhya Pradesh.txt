'''Rewa''' is a city in the north-eastern part of [[Madhya Pradesh]] state in [[India]]. It is the administrative center of [[Rewa District]] and [[Rewa Division]]. The city lies about {{convert|420|km|mi|0}}<ref>{{Cite web |title=Distance between Rewa and Bhopal |url=https://www.yatra.com/distance-between/distance-from-bhopal-to-rewa.html |access-date=18 July 2022 |website=Yatra}}</ref> northeast of the state capital [[Bhopal]] and  {{convert|230|km|mi|0}} north of the city of [[Jabalpur]]. The maximum length of Rewa district is 125&nbsp;km from east to west and the length of Rewa from north to south is 96&nbsp;km. This area is surrounded by Kaimur hills to the south <ref>{{Cite web |last= |first= |title=Kaimur Hills |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Kaimur-Hills |access-date=18 July 2022 |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}</ref> Vindhyachal ranges pass through the middle of the district.

==History==
{{see also|Rewa State}}
[[File: Delhi Durbar 1903.jpg|thumb|left|Delhi Durbar of 1903, held to commemorate the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra as Emperor and Empress of India: Elephant Carriage of the Maharaja of Rewa at the Retainers' Review, 7 January 1903]]
The district of Rewa derives its name from the town of Rewa, the district headquarters, which is another name for the [[Narmada River]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Rewa |url=https://rewa.nic.in/en/history |access-date=21 July 2022 |website=District Rewa}}</ref>

Present day Rewa was part of the Baghelkhand region which expanded from the present day [[Prayagraj]] in the North to [[Mahamaya Temple|Ratanpur]] in the South, [[Jabalpur]] in the West to [[Surajpur, Chhattisgarh|Surajpur]] in the East.

=== Baghel Dynasty ===
Baghel Dynasty was founded by Bhimaldev (son of Vyaghradev, the chieftain of Vyaghrapalli) in 1236 CE.<ref>{{Cite web |title=History of Baghel Khand |url=https://madhyapradesh.pscnotes.com/mppsc-mains-new-syllabus-paper-1/mains-paper-1-history-and-culture/history-of-baghelkhand/ |access-date=21 July 2022 |website=MPPSC Exam Notes}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|date=December 2022|reason=Exam prep/notes site}} Baghelas are basically [[Chaulukya dynasty|Chalukyans]] of [[Patan, Gujarat|Anhilwara]] (Gujarat).

The region was earlier governed by [[Lodhi (caste)|Lodhi Rajputs]] and Sengar chieftains of Rajgond Dynasty. Lodhi's Diwan Tiwari conspired with Baghelas and assisted in foundation of Baghela Rule in the Gahora Patti region. In return of this favour, Baghelas granted title of "Singh Tiwari" or "Adhrajiya Tiwari" to the Diwan Tiwari.

Raja Ramchandra shifted capital to [[Bandhavgarh National Park|Bandhavgarh]], and later Raja Vikramjit Singh shifted capital to Rewa in 1605 CE.

Bandhavgarh Fort was sieged by Mughals. Tansen and Birbal (Mahesh Das) were in court of Ramchandra Singh Baghel.

Raghuraj Singh Baghel built Govindgarh Fort, which lies in between Govindgarh lake. Govindgarh is famous for its exquisite varieties of mangoes.

Raja Gulab Singh was called "social reformer King" of Rewa.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2020-07-14 |title=Maharaja Gulab Singh of Rewa Princely State |url=https://www.mintageworld.com/media/detail/12315-maharaja-gulab-singh-of-rewa-princely-state/ |access-date=21 July 2022 |website=Mintage World}}</ref> Raja Martand Singh was the last Baghela Ruler. Later, the state joined the Union of India, after independence.

=== Revolt of 1857 ===
In the context of the 1857 Indian Rebellion, the princely state of Rewa played a significant role, but a controversial one. Thakur Ranmat Singh, a notable leader from Mankhari village in Satna district, emerged as a key figure in the uprising within the region. Holding the rank of Sardar in the Maharaja of Rewa's service, Thakur Ranmat Singh became increasingly discontented with British interference, particularly by the Resident Political Agent, Willoughby Osborne.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Kushwaha |first=Sonelal |title=विंध्य के वीर सपूत...जिन्होंने 1957 की क्रांति में छुड़ाए थे अंगेे्रजों के छक्के |language=Hindi |trans-title=The brave sons of Vindhya... who freed the sixes of the British in the 1957 revolution |work=Patrika |publisher= |publication-date=17 July 2022 |url=https://www.patrika.com/satna-news/the-brave-son-of-vindhyas-thakur-ranmat-singh-7284408/}}</ref>

Inspired by the rebellion's broader momentum, Ranmat Singh led a formidable group of 2,000 rebels, besieging Osborne's bungalow. Although Osborne escaped, the rebels continued their struggle, engaging in multiple battles across areas like Nagod, Bhilsain, Chitrakoot, Nowgong, and Keoti. These activities made Thakur Ranmat Singh a significant threat to British control in the area <ref>(https://testbook.com/mppsc-preparation/revolt-of-1857-in-madhya-pradesh) </ref><ref>{{Cite(https://ensureias.com/blog/current-affairs/thakur-ranmat-singh)</ref>

However, the Maharaja of Rewa, under British pressure, eventually turned against Ranmat Singh. Despite initial sympathies for his cause, the Maharaja facilitated Ranmat Singh's capture. Thakur Ranmat Singh was arrested, charged with the murder of Europeans, and hanged in August 1860.<ref>(https://ensureias.com/blog/current-affairs/thakur-ranmat-singh (https://cmsadmin.amritmahotsav.nic.in/district-reopsitory-detail.htm?9137{{Cite(https://indianculture.gov.in/node/2816073)</ref> 

This betrayal by the Rewa state highlights the complexities and internal conflicts during the 1857 Rebellion, where loyalty and resistance often intertwined in the fight against colonial rule.

== Demographics ==
As of 2011, Rewa had a population of about 2,35,654 out of which 1,24,012 are males and 1,11,642 are females. Rewa has an average literacy rate of 86.31%, male literacy is 91.67%, and female literacy is 80.40%. In Rewa, 10.76% of the population is under 6 years old.
