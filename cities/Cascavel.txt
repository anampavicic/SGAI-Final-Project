'''Cascavel''' is a city in the state of [[Paraná (state)|Paraná]] in Brazil. It is the fifth most populous city in the state with 348,051 inhabitants, according to IBGE 2022 Census.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-06-28 |title=População em Cascavel (PR) é de 348.051 pessoas, aponta o Censo do IBGE |url=https://g1.globo.com/pr/oeste-sudoeste/noticia/2023/06/28/populacao-em-cascavel-pr-e-de-348051-pessoas-aponta-o-censo-do-ibge.ghtml |access-date=2023-07-24 |website=G1 |language=pt-br}}</ref> The distance to [[Curitiba]], the state capital, is 491 kilometers by freeway.<ref name="Indicadores_da_Prefeitura">{{cite web | url = http://www.cascavel.pr.gov.br/indicadores.php | title = Indicadores do Portal do Município de Cascavel | year = 2013 | access-date = May 12, 2013 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130505084031/http://www.cascavel.pr.gov.br/indicadores.php | archive-date = May 5, 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref>

Relatively new and with a privileged topography, Cascavel's development was planned, which gives it wide streets and well distributed neighborhoods. With an area of 2,100,831&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, it is considered a strategic hub of [[Mercosul]]. It is the main city in the [[Cascavel Metropolitan Area]].

The city is on a [[plateau]] 781 meters above sea level. It is 504&nbsp;km west of the state capital of Curitiba and 605&nbsp;km west of the [[sea port]] of [[Paranaguá]], 140&nbsp;km from the three borders ([[Paraguay]], [[Argentina]] and Brazil) at 24° 58' South, 53° 26' West.

== Toponymy ==
The name of the city means [[Crotalus durissus|rattlesnake]] in Portuguese; it arises from a variation of the classical Latin "cascabus", meaning "bubbling water boiling". According to legend, a group of [[settlers]] camped one night in the region and they were woken by the sound of a rattle; later they realized they set up the camp next to a rattlesnake.

== History ==
=== Cycle of "erva mate" ===
The [[Kaingang people|Caingangue]] natives inhabited western Paraná, which was occupied by the Spaniards in 1557, when they founded the [[Ciudad del Real Guayrá]], in the current city of Terra Roxa.

A new occupation started in 1730 with troops (''tropeirismo'' in Portuguese), but the settlement of the current city began in the late 1910s by settlers of mixed racial ethnicity (''[[caboclos]]'' (people of indigenous and European descent)), and descendants of Slavic immigrants, at the peak of the cycle of ''[[yerba mate|erva mate]]''.

The village began to form on March 28, 1928, when José Silverio de Oliveira, dubbed "Nho Jeca", bought a glebe from the settler Jose Antonio Elias, in the historical area called Encruzilhada dos Gomes, and which is currently the Cascavel Velho neighborhood. It was at a junction of several trails open by ''ervateiros'' (cultivators of ''erva mate''), [[Droving|drovers]] and military, where de Oliveira set up his warehouse. His entrepreneurial spirit was key to the arrival of new people, who brought ideas and investments.

From the 1930s and 1940s, thousands of southern settlers, mostly descendants of Poles, Germans, Italians, Ukrainians and caboclos migrating from coffee regions, began logging, farming and raising pigs in the village, which became a district in 1938.

Notably, the locality was already included in military maps from 1924, and the village was made official by the town hall of [[Foz do Iguaçu]] in 1936, with the name of Cascavel. The prelate of that city, Monsignor William Maria Thiletzek, renamed it "Aparecida dos Portos" (a Brazilian name for Mary, The Mother of Jesus), a name that did not prosper amongst the inhabitants.

=== Cycle of wood ===
In the 1930s, with the cycle of ''erva mate'' at a close, the surrounding area entered into the so-called "cycle of wood", which attracted a large number of families from [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]] and [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. In particular, there were many Polish, German and Italian settlers, who formed the basis of the municipal population.

As the native forests were depleted, the land became available to agriculture sector, which underpins the present-day economy.

In 1938, Cascavel became an administrative district.

=== Emancipation ===
The municipality of Cascavel was emancipated on November 14, 1951, by state law n° 790, separating it from [[Foz do Iguaçu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legislacao.pr.gov.br/legislacao/pesquisarAto.do?action=exibir&codAto=16495&indice=1&totalRegistros=1 |title=Exibir Ato |publisher=Legislacao.pr.gov.br |date=1980-01-01 |accessdate=2022-08-26}}</ref> For decades there was a discussion about whether this would be the proper date, as the installation of the first municipal government occurred only on December 14, 1952. However, in 2010, with the law n° 5.689, the discussion was put to rest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cascavel.pr.gov.br/noticia.php?id=19340|title=Portal do Município de Cascavel - Prefeito Edgar Bueno faz lançamento da marca|website=www.cascavel.pr.gov.br|access-date=November 20, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110918085243/http://www.cascavel.pr.gov.br/noticia.php?id=19340|archive-date=September 18, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== Development ===
[[File:Praça_Migrante_Galafassi.jpg|thumb|right|Praça do Migrante ]]
As the cycle of timber closed in the late 1970s, industrialization began along with increased agricultural activity and a rising service industry.  In less than six decades, Cascavel went from a rest stop for travelers and trappers, to the largest municipality in western Paraná and one of the largest economic centers in southern Brazil.
