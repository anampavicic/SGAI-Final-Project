== Etymology ==
Baguio was called Kafagway by indigenous peoples. The name Baguio originated in the [[History of the Philippines (1898–1946)|American period]] and is derived from the [[Ibaloi language|Ibaloi]] word bagiw ([[moss]]), which was then Hispanicized as Baguio.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jay |date=April 18, 2017 |title=Brief History about Baguio City |url=https://freecityofpines.wordpress.com/2017/04/18/brief-history-about-baguio-city/ |access-date=July 20, 2019 |website=Baguio City |language=en}}</ref> A [[demonym]] for natives of the city, Ibagiw, is also derived from it.

==History==
===Ibaloi town of Kafagway===
Baguio used to be a vast mountain zone with lush highland forests, teeming with various wildlife such as the indigenous deer, [[cloud rat]]s, [[Philippine eagle]]s, [[Philippine warty pig]]s, and numerous species of flora. The area was a hunting ground of the indigenous peoples, notably the [[Ibaloi people|Ibalois]] and other [[Igorot people|Igorot]] ethnic groups. When the Spanish arrived in the Philippines, the area was never fully subjugated by Spain due to the intensive defense tactics of the indigenous Igorots of the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordilleras]].<ref name="PhilStudies2">{{Cite journal |last=Habana |first=Olivia M. |date=2000 |title=Gold Mining in Benguet to 1898 |url=http://www.philippinestudies.net/files/journals/1/articles/1662/public/1662-1761-1-PB.pdf |journal=Philippine Studies |volume=48 |pages=475–476 |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref>

Igorot oral history states the [[Benguet]] upper class, ''baknang'', was founded between 1565 and the early 1600s, by the marriage of a gold trader, Amkidit, and a Kankanaey maiden [[gold panning]] in Acupan. Their son, Baruy, discovered a gold deposit in the area, which he developed with hired workers and slaves.<ref name="PhilStudies2" />

In 1755, the [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] [[Friar|Fray]] Pedro de Vivar established a mission in Tonglo (Tongdo) outside Baguio. Before he was driven out the following year, this {{lang|es|rancheria}} included 220 people, including several ''baknang'' families. The Spanish tried to regain the mission in 1759, but were ambushed. This prompted the Governor General [[Pedro Manuel de Arandía Santisteban]] to send Don Manuel Arza de Urrutia on a punitive expedition, which resulted in the mission being burned to the ground.<ref name="PhilStudies2" />{{rp|477–478}}

===Spanish rule===
During [[History of the Philippines (1521–1898)|Spanish rule]] in 1846, the Spaniards established a command post or a ''{{lang|es|comandancia}}'' in the nearby town of [[La Trinidad, Benguet|La Trinidad]], and organized Benguet into 31 {{lang|es|[[ranchería]]s}}, one of which was Kafagway, a wide grassy area where the present [[Burnham Park (Baguio)|Burnham Park]] is situated. Kafagway was then a minor {{lang|es|rancheria}} consisting of only about 20 houses; most of the lands in Kafagway were owned by a prominent Ibaloi, [[Mateo Cariño]], who served as its chieftain.<ref name="NordisNet-BaguioHistory2">{{Cite news |last=Boquiren |first=Rowena Reyes |date=August 23, 2015 |title=Baguio's history and cultural heritage |work=Northern Dispatch Weekly |url=http://www.nordis.net/2015/08/baguios-history-and-cultural-heritage/ |access-date=October 13, 2018}}</ref> The Spanish {{lang|es|presidencia}}, which was located at Bag-iw at the vicinity of Guisad Valley was later moved to Cariño's house where the current city hall stands. ''Bag-iw'' was the Ibaloi toponym of the town, an Ibaloi term for "moss" which was historically abundant in the area. This name was spelled by the Spaniards as ''Baguio''.<ref name="BaguioMidlandCourier3" /><ref name="DILG-CAR2">{{Cite web |title=Baguio City; History and Government |url=http://www.dilgcar.com/index.php/baguio-city |access-date=February 21, 2016 |website=[[Department of the Interior and Local Government]] – Cordillera Administrative Region}}</ref>

===First Philippine Republic===

During the [[Philippine Revolution]] in July 1899, Filipino revolutionary forces under [[Pedro Paterno]] liberated La Trinidad from the Spaniards and took over the government, proclaiming Benguet as a province of the new [[First Philippine Republic|Philippine Republic]]. Baguio was converted into a "town", with Mateo Cariño being the {{lang|es|presidente}} (mayor).<ref name="BaguioMidlandCourier3" /><ref name="DILG-CAR2" />

When the United States occupied the Philippines after the [[Spanish–American War]], Baguio was selected to become the [[summer capital]] of the then [[Insular Government of the Philippine Islands|Philippine Islands]].

Burnham, one of the earliest successful modern [[Urban planner|city planners]], designed the mountain retreat following the tenets of the [[City Beautiful movement]]. In 1904, the rest of the city was planned out by Burnham.

{{main| People Power Revolution}}
In the wake of the [[Snap Presidential elections of 1986]], antidictatorship organizers were based largely in the Azotea Building midway up Session Road, and in Cafe Amapola further up Session, on its intersection with Governor Pack Road. Because the United States' Armed Forces Radio and Television Network station at Camp John Hay was transmitting news from Manila, they learned early on that the [[People Power revolution|People Power Revolution]] had begun in Manila. Deciding that their locations were too unsafe, they encamped in the courtyard of the [[Baguio Cathedral]], which was located on higher ground.<ref name="PeoplePowerBaguioRappler">{{Cite news |title=EDSA '86 up north: The day Baguio turned yellow |language=en |work=Rappler |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/baguio-people-power-edsa-revolution |access-date=March 17, 2021}}</ref> They were later joined by Lt.

==Geography==
[[File:Trees near UP Baguio (Baguio, Benguet)(2018-11-26).jpg|thumb|Pine trees near [[UP Baguio]]]]

Baguio is a highland city nestled within the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Central]] mountain range in northern [[Luzon]]. While the downtown core ranges from 1400 to 1500 meters above sea level, elevations within Baguio's administrative boundaries extend from about 900 meters (along the [[Bued River]]) to almost {{convert|1700|m}} (around the Busol watershed). Mountain peaks on the outskirts of Baguio reach over {{convert|2200|m}} above sea level, the highest being [[Mount Santo Tomas]] in [[Tuba, Benguet|Tuba]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://en-ca.topographic-map.com/map-lzhtp/Philippines/ |title=Philippines topographic map |author=<!--Not stated--> |access-date=April 21, 2024}}</ref>

Enclosed by the province of [[Benguet]],<ref name="BaguioGovPH-About2" /> the city covers a small area of {{convert|57.5|km2|1|abbr=out}}. Most of the developed part of the city is built on uneven, hilly terrain of the northern section. When [[Daniel Burnham]] drew plans for the city, he made the City Hall a reference point where the city limits extend {{convert|8.2|km}} from east to west and {{convert|7.2|km}} from north to south.<ref name="BaguioGovPH-About2" />

===Barangays===
Baguio is composed of 129 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

====Proposed merger of barangays====
A proposed merging of the city's 129 barangays had not been implemented since its inception in 2000. Several local officials stressed that many of the city's barangays did not comply with the minimum requirements in the [[Local Government Code of the Philippines]] that a highly urbanized city must have a certified population of least 5,000 inhabitants. According to Mayor Mauricio Domogan, in the past, benefits granted to local governments were based on the number of existing barangays; this led former local officials to create as many barangays as possible in the city in order to acquire additional benefits from the national government. The proposed merger, which will reduce the barangays from 130 to about 40 to 50 by merging adjacent ones, is believed to solve several issues concerning barangay boundary disputes, seemingly biased [[Internal Revenue Allotment|allocation of funds]] for larger barangays in relation to barangays with lesser area and population, as well as the inadequate [[honorarium]] of barangay officials.<ref name="BaguioGovPh-BrgyMerger2">{{Cite news |last=See |first=Dexter A. |title=Merger of city's 130 barangays pressed |publisher=Official website of the City Government of Baguio |url=http://www.baguio.gov.ph/content/merger-city%E2%80%99s-128-barangays-pressed |access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name="SunStarPh-BrgyMerger2">{{Cite news |date=March 8, 2017 |title=Special body formed for barangay merger |work=SunStar |url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph/article/130040 |access-date=September 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name="Midland-BrgyMerger2">{{Cite news |last=Cruz |first=Maria Aprila W. |title=More dialogues on merger of barangay pressed |publisher=Baguio Midland Courier |url=http://www.baguiomidlandcourier.com.ph/city.asp?mode=archives/2014/january/1-19-2014/city6.txt |access-date=September 28, 2018 |archive-date=September 28, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180928201106/http://www.baguiomidlandcourier.com.ph/city.asp?mode=archives/2014/january/1-19-2014/city6.txt |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Baguio - Lower Bonifacio (Baguio, Benguet)(2018-11-26).jpg|thumb|[[Smog]] from vehicles in Bonifacio Street in 2018]]

Baguio suffers from [[air pollution]] and is one of the cities with the dirtiest air in the Philippines, according to a 2014 [[World Health Organization|WHO]] report;<ref>{{Cite news |title=Baguio air is among the dirtiest in the country |language=en-US |work=GMA News |url=https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/360705/scitech/science/baguio-air-is-among-the-dirtiest-in-the-country/ |access-date=July 18, 2019}}</ref> a slight improvement in the city's air quality was cited in 2017 by the [[Department of Environment and Natural Resources|DENR]]'s Environmental Management Bureau.

Baguio is also a planned city. American Architect and Urban Planner [[Daniel Burnham]] was commissioned to design the new capital; his design for the city was based on the [[City Beautiful movement]],<ref>{{Cite book |last=McKenna |first=Rebecca Tinio |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nEGvDQAAQBAJ |title=American Imperial Pastoral: The Architecture of US Colonialism in the Philippines |date=January 20, 2017 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-41793-6 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=nEGvDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 96] |language=en |access-date=August 27, 2022}}</ref> which features broad streets and avenues radiating out from rectangles.

Baguio's current landscape is mostly of contemporary architecture.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Session Road, Baguio.JPG|thumb|Porta Vaga Mall along Session Road]]

Baguio's contemporary architecture is largely of American build,{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} since Americans were the ones to establish a station here. A few examples include those built at Teacher's Camp and Camp John Hay, previous American installations in the city as well as the current Baguio City Hall.

The original inhabitants of Baguio are the [[Ibaloi people]] (natively pronounced as "Ivadoi"). When the Americans established the city in the early 1900s, early settlers in the city included members of other [[Igorot]] tribes (''Igudut'' in [[Ibaloi language|Ibaloi]]), the lowlander [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]] (''Iduko''), Americans (''Merikano''), and ''[[Filipino Mestizos|mestizos]]''. A significant number of [[Filipino Chinese|Chinese]] (both [[Cantonese people|Cantonese]] and [[Hoklo people|Hokkien]]) and [[Japanese in the Philippines|Japanese]] laborers were also hired to build [[Kennon Road]], many of whom later settled in the city.<ref name="Pungayan" />

The vice mayor leads the [[Baguio City Council|city council]], composed of 12 elected councilors and 3 ''ex-officio'' members (the ABC President, SK President, and IPMR of the city). The City Government holds office at the Baguio City Hall.<ref>{{Cite web |title=City Councilors |url=http://www.baguio.gov.ph/councilors |access-date=July 18, 2019 |website=City Government of Baguio}}</ref>

The 129 barangays are led by their own captains assisted by a 7-man barangay council.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Baguio City |url=http://www.dilgcar.com/index.php/baguio-city |access-date=June 17, 2018 |publisher=Department of the Interior and Local Government, Cordillera Administrative Region}}</ref>

These officials are term-limited by up to 3 consecutive terms, with each term lasting for 3 years.

==Sports==
[[File:Baguio Athletic Bowl Jan 2018 a.jpg|thumb|Baguio Athletic Bowl]]

Baguio has hosted several sporting events, even those of international standing. The [[Baguio Athletic Bowl]] within the grounds of [[Burnham Park (Philippines)|Burnham Park]] is one of Baguio's primary sporting venues. Baguio hosted the [[World Chess Championship 1978|1978 World Chess Championship]] match between [[Anatoly Karpov]] and [[Viktor Korchnoi]], building the Baguio Convention Center for that purpose. The city is a participant in the CARAA games or the Cordillera Administrative Region Athletic Association, hosting it last in 2016 and 2017.

=== Transportation ===

====Air====
[[File:Loakan_Airport.JPEG|thumb|[[Loakan Airport]] runway in the outskirts of the city]]

[[Loakan Airport]] is the lone airport serving the general area of Baguio. The airport is classified as a trunkline airport, or a major commercial domestic airport, by the [[Civil Aviation Authority of the Philippines]]. Major commercial operations to Baguio however ceased after [[Philippine Airlines]] closed their Baguio route in 1998. There were attempts to reopen Baguio routes throughout the following two decades by different airline operators such as [[Asian Spirit]] and [[Sky Pasada]] but none were able to sustain continuous operation.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cabreza |first=Vincent |title=Ibaloy folk brace for change as Baguio flights resume |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1703147/ibaloy-folk-brace-for-change-as-baguio-flights-resume |access-date=December 16, 2022}}</ref> Commercial flights resumed in 2022 with Philippine Airlines (operated by [[PAL Express]]) operating Baguio–Cebu flights and vice-versa but operations was halted by Philippine Airlines in July 2024 because of poor passenger traffic.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cabreza |first=Vincent |date=December 16, 2022 |title=Maiden flight of Baguio-Cebu route lands at Summer Capital's only airport |work=Inquirer |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1705876/maiden-flight-of-baguio-cebu-route-lands-at-summer-capitals-only-airport |access-date=December 16, 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Dumlao |first=Artemio |title=PAL to halt Baguio-Cebu flights |url=https://www.philstar.com/business/2024/05/31/2359374/pal-halt-baguio-cebu-flights |access-date=2024-07-26 |website=Philstar.com}}</ref>

The airport is located south of the city center. Due to the limited length of the runway, being only {{cvt|1,802|m}} long, it is restricted to commuter size aircraft. The airport is used primarily by helicopters, turbo-prop and piston engine aircraft, although on rare occasions light business jets (LBJ) have flown into the airport.

[[Jeepney]]s and [[Taxicab|taxis]] are the main means of public transportation in the city. The government's push for jeepney modernization has led to an increase of modern EURO 4 compliant PUVs plying Baguio's center. The rollout however for full jeepney modernization had been hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic. There are several bus lines linking Baguio with [[Manila]], [[Bontoc, Mountain Province|Bontoc]], [[Mariveles, Bataan|Mariveles]], [[Olongapo]], [[Cabanatuan]], and provinces such as [[Pangasinan]], [[Pampanga]], [[Bataan]],<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cabreza |first=Vincent |date=December 16, 2020 |title=Bus firms resuming Baguio trips |language=en |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1372116/bus-firms-resuming-baguio-trips |access-date=September 14, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201216002601/https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1372116/bus-firms-resuming-baguio-trips |archive-date=December 16, 2020}}</ref> [[Nueva Ecija]], [[Aurora (province)|Aurora]], [[Cavite]], [[La Union]], [[Nueva Vizcaya]] and those in the Ilocos regions.

From Metro Manila, Baguio is accessible via [[NLEX]] (from Bulacan to Pampanga), [[SCTEX]] (Pampanga to Tarlac) and [[TPLEX]] (from Tarlac to La Union). The three main access roads leading to Baguio from the lowlands are [[Kennon Road]] (formerly known as the ''Benguet Road''),<ref name="Inquirer2">{{Cite news |last=Cabreza |first=Vincent |date=May 16, 2012 |title=Fighting for century-old Kennon Road |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |publisher=Inquirer Northern Luzon |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/194077/fighting-for-century-old-kennon-road |access-date=February 29, 2016 |quote=The colonial government decided then that constructing the Benguet Road (Kennon Road's original name) would provide the Americans a short route up the Benguet mountains. ...

In an effort to address traffic congestion and the lack of car parking at tourist spots in the city, Baguio operates a free bus shuttle service called the '''Hop On, Hop Off (HoHo) Tourist Bus'''.

* Monorail - A monorail project from Baguio to La Trinidad is being mulled over by the SSS as a possible investment in CAR. It is seen to further boost tourism and decongest traffic.

=== Water and electricity ===
Most of the water supply of the city is provided for by the Baguio Water District, founded in 1975 as the successor to the now-defunct Department of Public Services. It currently operates 60 deep wells to cater to its more than 300,000 consumers. It currently serves 122 out of the 129 barangays in the city and some parts of [[Tuba, Benguet]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Catajan |first=Maria Elena |date=March 27, 2019 |title=P80-M Baguio Water District building opens |language=en |work=SunStar |url=https://www.sunstar.com.ph//article/1798851 |access-date=July 19, 2019}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite news |last=Agoot |first=Liza |date=August 29, 2018 |title=Water district worried on depletion of city's water supply |language=en |work=Philippine News Agency |url=https://www.pna.gov.ph/articles/1046310 |access-date=July 19, 2019}}</ref> In recent years, the BWD has expressed concern over the city's depleting water supply, due in part to the private wells dug by private individuals and companies.<ref name=":12" />

Electric services are provided by [[Benguet Electric Cooperative]] (BENECO), the sole electric power distributor in Benguet. In 2012, a bill was filled in the House of Representatives seeking the creation of the Baguio Electric Cooperative or BAELCO, an entity to provide for the city's own electricity needs, separate from BENECO. Its creation has been met with opposition by various groups citing the need of a feasibility study on the separation. The creation of a separate electric franchise for Baguio would also infringe on BENECO's existing franchise that mandated BENECO to provide electricity for both Baguio and Benguet which would create legal implications if it was to be amended.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Palangchao |first=Harley |date=December 25, 2011 |title=Bill that seeks to split Beneco into two filed in Lower House |work=Baguio Midland Courier |url=http://www.baguiomidlandcourier.com.ph/front.asp?mode=archives/2011/december/12-25-2011/front1.txt |access-date=July 19, 2019 |archive-date=July 18, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200718145515/http://www.baguiomidlandcourier.com.ph/front.asp?mode=archives/2011/december/12-25-2011/front1.txt |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Agoot |first=Liza |date=January 15, 2012 |title=Baelco firm on managing city's EC, but legal existence vague |work=Baguio Midland Courier |url=http://baguiomidlandcourier.com.ph/region.asp?mode=archives/2012/january/1-15-2012/reg1.txt |access-date=July 19, 2019 |archive-date=July 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719043415/http://baguiomidlandcourier.com.ph/region.asp?mode=archives/2012/january/1-15-2012/reg1.txt |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Sinumlag |first=Alma B. |date=January 29, 2012 |title=Beneco says splitting franchise need further study |work=Northern Dispatch |url=https://nordis.net/2012/01/29/topic/energy/beneco-says-splitting-franchise-need-further-study/ |access-date=December 15, 2021}}</ref>

The city is also the only local government unit to own and operate its own renewable energy plant. Originally constructed in the 1920s, the Asin Mini Hydropower Plants 1, 2 and 3 located in Tuba, Benguet came under the city's possession after the lapse of the 25-year lease agreement with the Aboitiz-owned Hydroelectric Development Corporation (HEDCOR). The plant acted as both a power source and another income-generating asset of the city as BENECO was also its main client. The power plant however was forced to cease operation on 2015 when the Energy Regulatory Commission issued a [[cease and desist order]] to the city due to the lack of a certificate of compliance from the city. The city currently has plans to rehabilitate the power plants so that they could resume operations once again.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Cimatu |first=Frank |date=September 20, 2019 |title=Magalong prioritizes preservation of Baguio 'heirlooms' |work=Rappler |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/240562-magalong-prioritizes-preservation-baguio-heirlooms/ |access-date=December 15, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Titling of Asin hydro plant properties to be pursued |url=https://www.baguio.gov.ph/content/titling-asin-hydro-plant-properties-be-pursued |access-date=December 15, 2021 |website=City Government of Baguio}}</ref>

It was once a [[one-room school]] built upon [[Mateo Cariño]]'s 2 [[hectare]] lot and [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloy]] house he donated to the local government. Its roof was made of [[Reed (plant)|reed]] and [[Imperata cylindrica|cogongrass]] with [[Hewing|hewn]] wood walls and floor.
