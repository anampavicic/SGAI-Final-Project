'''Bắc Ninh''' ({{audio|Bac Ninh.ogg|listen|help=no}}) is a city in the northern part of [[Vietnam]] and is the capital of [[Bắc Ninh province]]. The city is the cultural, administrative and commercial center of the province. The city area is 82.60 square km, with a population of 247,702 in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bắc Ninh (District-level City, Bắc Ninh, Vietnam) - Population Statistics, Charts, Map and Location |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/vietnam/admin/b%E1%BA%AFc_ninh/256__b%E1%BA%AFc_ninh/ |access-date=2024-02-07 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> In January 2006, the town (''thị xã'') of Bắc Ninh was upgraded to city (''thành phố'').

==History==
In March 1884, Bắc Ninh was the site of a decisive [[Bắc Ninh campaign|campaign]] in the wars between France and assorted [[Black Flag Army]] forces, and the town fell to the French.<ref>Jack D. Ellis ''The early life of Georges Clemenceau, 1841-1893'' 1980 Page 115  "By March the town of Bac-Ninh fell to the French, but contrary to Clemenceau's prediction, no major war with China ensued. By June, Ferry finally received Chinese recognition of France's rights in Tonkin, but a palace coup in Peking brought ..."</ref> Thereafter under French protectorate, the town was confirmed as the center of all political, economic, cultural offices of colonial administration in the province. The land of the Bắc Ninh Citadel, within Yên, Niem and Do Villages, was occupied by French troops.<ref>''Viet Nam Social Sciences ''  Ủy ban khoa học xã hội Việt Nam Numéros 1 à 3 2006- Page 29  "In French domination, Bac Ninh Town was still the town of Bac Ninh province with all political, economic, cultural offices etc. of colonial administration. The land of Bac Ninh Citadel belonging to Yen, Niem and Do Villages were occupied by .. "</ref> At this time Bắc Ninh became known in Europe for its lacquer work and mother-of-pearl inlaid black-wood screens, cabinets, trays, and boxes.<ref>Alfred Cunningham ''The French in Tonkin and South China'' 1902 - Page 76 "The best native work produced is mother-of-pearl inlaid in native black-wood, of which remarkably handsome specimens may be obtained in the form of screens, cabinets, trays, boxes, etc. The home of this work is really the town of Bac-ninh."</ref> [[Bắc Ninh Railway Station]] opened after 1904. An ambush of French troops by the [[Việt Minh]] occurred at Bắc Ninh while the 1946 Fontainebleau Conference was ongoing.<ref>''Viet Nam; the origins of revolution'', 1885-1946 - Page 140 John T. McAlister, Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Center of International Studies, American University (Washington, D.C.). Center for Research in Social Systems - 1968 "The tense atmosphere of the conference was heightened further after an ambush of French troops by the Viet Minh in the north Viet Nam town of Bac Ninh on August 4, in which 12 French soldiers were killed and 41 wounded."</ref><ref>''China Monthly Review'' Volumes 102 à 103 - Page 258 1946 "French troops and Annamite forces, said to have included both soldiers and civilian irregulars, fought for nine hours early this week in the streets 6f the Indo-Chinese town of Bac Ninh, 19 miles north-east of Hanoi."</ref>

The city's name means "northern serenity".

==Buildings==
The city is home to the Banking Academy of Vietnam, Bắc Ninh campus (Học viện Ngân hàng), the Kinh Bắc International School, and the Military Academy of Politics main campus (Học viện Chính trị Quân sự), and [[Bắc Ninh Railway Station]]. There is a shrine to [[Bà Chúa Kho]].<ref>Pattana Kitiarsa ''Religious commodifications in Asia: marketing gods'' Page 155  2008 "rapidly growing popularity of the Granary/Treasury Queen' (Bà Chúa Kho) near Bắc Ninh town, Ngô Ðức Thịnh relates this phenomenon to Vietnam's transition to a market economy."</ref>

==Administrative subdivisions ==<!--Can this be put into bullet points?-->
The city is administratively divided into 19 units, including 19 urban wards (''phường'') - Đáp Cầu, Hạp Lĩnh, Khắc Niệm, Phong Khê, Khúc Xuyên, Thị Cầu, Vũ Ninh, Suối Hoa, Tiền An, Ninh Xá, Vân Dương, Vạn An, Vệ An, Kinh Bắc, Đại Phúc, Võ Cường, Hoà Long, Kim Chân and Nam Sơn.
