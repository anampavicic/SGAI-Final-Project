'''Irbid''' ({{langx|ar|إِربِد}}), known in ancient times as '''Arabella''' or '''Arbela''' (Άρβηλα in [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]]), is the capital and largest city of [[Irbid Governorate]]. It has the second-largest metropolitan population in [[Jordan]] after [[Amman]], with a population of around 2,003,800.<ref>http://dosweb.dos.gov.jo/DataBank/Population_Estimares/PopulationEstimatesbyLocality.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190605160255/http://dosweb.dos.gov.jo/DataBank/Population_Estimares/PopulationEstimatesbyLocality.pdf |date=5 June 2019 }} {{Bare URL PDF|date=March 2022}}</ref> As a city, Irbid is Jordan's third-largest, after Amman and [[Zarqa]].

Irbid is located about {{convert|70|km}} north of Amman on the northern ridge of the [[Gilead]], equidistant from [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]], [[Beit Ras]] ([[Capitolias]]), and [[Um Qais]], and approximately {{convert|20|km}} south of the [[Syria]]n border.

Irbid was built on successive [[Early Bronze Age]] settlements and was possibly the [[Hebrew Bible|biblical]] Beth Arbel and the Arbila of the [[Decapolis]], a Hellenistic league of the 1st-2nd century BCE. The population of Irbid swelled in the late 19th century, and prior to 1948 it served as a significant centre of transit trade.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/place/Irbid Irbid]. ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190421201403/https://www.britannica.com/place/Irbid |date=21 April 2019 }}.</ref>

The city is a major ground transportation hub between Amman, [[Syria]] to the north, and [[Mafraq]] to the east. The Irbid region is also home to several colleges and universities. The two most prominent universities are [[Jordan University of Science and Technology]] and [[Yarmouk University]].

== Name ==
The original spelling was probably ארבאל, a name that also appears in [[Book of Joshua|Hosea]] 10:14. This name persisted among Jews and was later transmitted to the Arabs. Greek sources from the same periods also confirm this, often featuring a final 'a', which might indicate an official version of the name.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Elitzur |first=Yoel |title=Ancient Place Names in the Holy Land: Preservation and History |publisher=The Hebrew University Magness Press ; Eisenbrauns |year=2004 |location=Jerusalem ; Winona Lake, Virginia |pages=59-60}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Irbid Archeolog.Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Pottery dating from the Bronze Age displayed in the Irbid Archaeological Museum]]
{{Further|topic=the prehistoric burial site|Uyun al-Hammam}}
Artifacts and graves in the area show that Irbid was inhabited in the [[Bronze Age]]. Pieces of pottery and wall stones found at '''Tell Irbid''' were estimated to be made in the year 3200 B.C.<ref>[Lenzen, C. J.; Gordon, R. L.; and Mcquitty, A. M. 1985; Excavation at Tell Irbid and Beit Ras, 1985. ADAJ. Vol 29, pp. 151–159]</ref> A city wall dated to around 1300-1200 BC.

* Phase III (c. 3200 BC)
* Phase II (c. 1300-1150 BC)
* Phase I (c. 1150-800 BC)

In the [[Hellenistic]] period, Irbid, then known as '''Arabella''' was a major trade center. Before the advent of [[Islam]], Arabella was famous for producing some of the best [[wine]]s in the ancient world. The area in the region had extremely fertile soil and moderate climate, allowing the growing of high quality grapes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Irbid |url=https://book2jordan.com/destinations/irbid/ |access-date=2024-09-05 |website=Book2Jordan |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Irbid History, History of Irbid, Irbid City Information :: Traveltill.com |url=https://traveltill.com/destination/Jordan/Irbid/history.php |access-date=2024-09-05 |website=Traveltill}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=mahmoudmaayta |date=2022-06-04 |title=Irbid, Jordan |url=https://atlastours.net/destination/jordan/irbid/ |access-date=2024-09-05 |website=Atlas Tours |language=en-US}}</ref>

After the Muslim conquests, the city came under the rule of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and became known as Irbid, at which time it shifted from wine to [[olive oil]] production. Wheat was also an important product in the area.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Haitham Mahmoud El-Hurani|first=Mohamed|date=1975|title=Economic analysis of the development of the wheatsubsector of Jordan|url=https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6621&context=rtd|access-date=17 September 2020|website=Iowa State University Digital Repository}}</ref>

In 1596 it appeared in the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman]] [[Defter|tax registers]] named as ''Irbid'', situated in the ''[[nahiya]]'' (subdistrict) of Bani Juhma, part of the [[Hauran Sanjak]]. It had 72 households and 35 bachelors; all [[Muslim]]. The villagers paid a fixed tax-rate of 25% on agricultural products; including wheat (22,500 [[akçe]]), barley, summer crops, fruit trees, goats and bee-hives; in addition to a market toll. The total tax was 38,116 [[akçe]].<ref>Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 203</ref>

In 1838, [[Eli Smith]] noted Irbid (Arbela) as being a place with [[Sunni Muslim]].<ref>Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/163/mode/1up 163]</ref>

The Jordanian census of 1961 found 44,585 inhabitants in Irbid.<ref>Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p. [http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/JordanCensusPages/JordanCensus1961-p13.pdf 13]</ref>

Irbid today combines the bustle of a provincial [[Middle East]]ern town and the youthful nightlife of a typical college town.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} The city is home to four major universities: Yarmouk University, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Irbid National University and Jadara University. In addition, it is home for two campuses of Balqa Applied University and several private colleges. University Street, which defines the western border of the Yarmouk University campus, is popular with locals as well as with the occasional foreign visitors who stop by to relax in any of its numerous restaurants and cafés that open late into the night.

Though not usually a major tourist destination itself, Irbid is home to two notable museums: the Museum of Jordanian Heritage and the Jordan Natural History Museum, both on the campus of [[Yarmouk University]]. Furthermore, Irbid's strategic location in northern Jordan makes it a convenient starting point for tourists interested in seeing the northern [[Jordan Valley (Middle East)|Jordan Valley]]; visiting [[Umm Qais]], Beit Ras ([[Capitolias]]), [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]], [[Ajloun]], [[Umm el-Jimal]] and other historical sites; or traveling on to [[Syria]].
