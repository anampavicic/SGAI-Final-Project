'''Uman''' ({{langx|uk|Умань}}, {{IPA|uk|ˈumɐnʲ|IPA|audio=Uk-Умань.ogg}}, {{langx|pl|Humań}}) is a city in [[Cherkasy Oblast]], central [[Ukraine]]. It is located to the east of [[Vinnytsia]]. Located in the east of the historical region of [[Podolia]], the city rests on the banks of the [[Umanka (river)|Umanka River]]. Uman serves as the administrative center of [[Uman Raion]] ([[raion|district]]). It hosts the administration of [[Uman urban hromada]], one of the [[hromada]]s of Ukraine.<ref name="admreform_2020_uman">{{cite web |title=Уманська територіальна громада |url=https://decentralization.gov.ua/newgromada/4860/composition |publisher=decentralization.gov.ua |language=uk}}</ref> Population: {{Ua-pop-est2022|81,525|punct=.}}

Among [[Ukrainians]], Uman is known for its depiction of the [[Haydamak]] rebellions in [[Taras Shevchenko]]'s longest of poems, ''Haidamaky'' ("The Haidamaks", 1843).<ref>Magocsi, A History of Ukraine, 1996, p297</ref> The city is also a pilgrimage site for [[Breslov (Hasidic group)|Breslov Hasidic Jews]] and a major center of gardening research containing the [[Sofiyivka Park|dendrological park Sofiyivka]] and the University of Gardening.

Uman (Humań) was a [[private town|privately owned city]] of [[Poland]] and the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]].

==Name==
In addition to the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] {{lang|uk|Умань}} (''Uman''), in other languages the name of the city is {{langx|pl|Humań}} and {{langx|yi|אומאַן}}.

==History==
===Polish rule===
Uman was first mentioned in historical documents in 1616, when it was under Polish rule.<ref name=eou>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Uman|url=http://encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\U\M\Uman.htm|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Ukraine|access-date=26 September 2011}}</ref> It was part of the [[Bracław Voivodeship]] of the [[Lesser Poland Province, Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Lesser Poland Province]]. Its role at this time was as a defensive fort to withstand [[Tatar]] raids, containing a prominent [[Cossack]] regiment that was stationed within the town. In 1648 it was taken from the Poles by Ivan Hanzha, colonel to Cossack leader [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], and Uman was converted to the administrative center of cossack regiment for the region.<ref name=eou/> 

Poland retook Uman in 1667, after which the town was deserted by many of its residents who fled eastward to [[Left-bank Ukraine]].<ref name=eou/> From 1670&ndash;1674, Uman was a residence to the [[Hetman]] of [[right-bank Ukraine]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}. It was part of [[Ottoman Empire]] between 1672 and 1699.

Under the ownership of the [[Potocki family]] of Polish nobles (1726–1832) Uman grew in economic and cultural importance. A [[Order of Saint Basil the Great|Basilian]] monastery and school were established in this time.<ref name=eou/>

The Uman region was site of [[haidamaky]] uprisings in 1734, 1750, and 1768.<ref name=eou/> Notably during the latter, Cossack rebels [[Maksym Zalizniak]] and [[Ivan Gonta]] captured Uman during the [[Koliyivshchyna]] uprising against Polish rule. During this revolt, a [[Massacre of Uman|massacre took place]] against [[Jew]]s, [[Polish people|Poles]] and [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] [[Uniate]]s.<ref name=eou/> On the very first day large numbers of Ukrainians deserted the ranks of Polish forces and joined the rebels when the city was surrounded. Thousands from the surrounding areas fled to the Cossack garrison in Uman for protection. The military commander of Uman, Mladanovich, betrayed the city's Jews and allowed the pursuing Cossacks in, in exchange for clemency towards the Polish population.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In the span of three days an estimated{{by whom|date=September 2012}} 20,000{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Poles and Jews were slain with extreme cruelty, according to numerous Polish sources, with one source<ref>Paul Robert Magocsi "A History of Ukraine", Univ. of Washington Press 1996, p.300</ref> giving an estimate of 2,000 casualties.

The Polish 8th National Cavalry Brigade was garrisoned in the city in 1790.<ref>{{cite book|last=Gembarzewski|first=Bronisław|title=Rodowody pułków polskich i oddziałów równorzędnych od r. 1717 do r. 1831|year=1925|language=pl|publisher=Towarzystwo Wiedzy Wojskowej|location=Warszawa|page=10}}</ref>

===Russian and Soviet rule===

With the 1793 [[Second Partition of Poland]], Uman became part of the [[Russian Empire]] and a number of aristocratic residences were built there. In 1795, Uman became a povit/[[uezd]] center in Voznesensk Governorate, and in 1797, in [[Kyiv Governorate]].<ref name=eou/>

Into the 20th century, Uman was linked by rail to [[Kyiv]] and [[Odesa]], leading to rapid development of its industrial sector.<ref name=eou/> Its population grew from 10,100 in 1860 to 29,900 in 1900 and over 50,000 in 1914.<ref name=eou/> According to the [[Russian Empire Census|Russian census of 1897]], Uman with a population of 31,016 was the second largest city of Podolia after [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]].

In 1941, the [[Battle of Uman]] took place in the vicinity of the town, where the [[Wehrmacht|German army]] encircled [[Red Army|Soviet]] positions. [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Benito Mussolini]] visited Uman in 1941. Uman was occupied by German forces from 1 August 1941, to [[Uman–Botoşani Offensive|10 March 1944]].{{cn|date=April 2023}} The Germans operated the AGSSt 16 assembly center for prisoners of war in 1941, and the Stalag 349 [[German prisoner-of-war camps in World War II|POW camp]] from September 1941 to October 1943.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Megargee|first1=Geoffrey P.|last2=Overmans|first2=Rüdiger|last3=Vogt|first3=Wolfgang|year=2022|title=The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos 1933–1945.

In January 1989 the population was 90,596 people.<ref>[http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/sng89_reg2.php Всесоюзная перепись населения 1989 г.

===Independent Ukraine===
As of 2011, the city has optical and farm-machinery plants, a cannery, a brewery, a vitamin factory, a sewing factory, a footwear factory, and other industrial enterprises. The main architectural monuments are the catacombs of the old fortress, the Basilian monastery (1764), the city hall (1780–1782), the Dormition Roman Catholic church in the Classicist style (1826), and 19th-century trading stalls.<ref name=eou/>

[[File:Yman 116.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Sofiyivka Park]] in Uman]]
Uman's landmark is a famous park complex, [[Sofiyivka Park|Sofiyivka]] ({{langx|uk|Софiївка}}; {{langx|pl|Zofiówka}}), founded in 1796 by [[Count]] [[Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki]], a [[szlachcic|Polish noble]], who named it for his wife Sofia. The park features a number of waterfalls and narrow, arching stone bridges crossing the streams and scenic ravines.{{cn|date=April 2023}}

Until 18 July 2020, Uman was designated as a [[City of regional significance (Ukraine)|city of oblast significance]] and did not belong to Uman Raion even though it was the center of the raion. As part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions of Cherkasy Oblast to four, the city was merged into Uman Raion.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Про утворення та ліквідацію районів.

==Jewish community==
A large [[Jewish community]] lived in Uman in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Second World War]], in 1941, the [[Battle of Uman]] took place in the vicinity of the town, where the [[Wehrmacht|German army]] encircled [[Red Army|Soviet]] positions. The Germans deported the entire Jewish community, murdering around 17,000 Jews,<ref name="Rosh Hashana">[http://www.breslov.com/bri/umanrh.html#chapter4 "Uman! Uman! Rosh HaShanah! A guide to Rebbe Nachman's Rosh HaShanah in Uman".]  Breslov.</ref> and completely destroyed the Jewish cemetery, burial place of the victims of the 1768 uprising as well as Rebbe Nachman of Breslov. After the war, a [[Breslov (Hasidic dynasty)|Breslov]] [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasid]] managed to locate the Rebbe's grave and preserved it when the Soviets turned the entire area into a housing project.<ref name= "Rosh Hashana" />

Since the 1990s there has been a small, but growing, Jewish population in Uman, concentrated around Rebbe Nachman of Breslov tomb on Pushkina street. The local Jews are mostly involved in pilgrimage of Jewish tourists that arrive to the town. In 2018, the community saw large growth with about 10–20 families coming from Israel, accompanied by a small movement of young American couples.{{citation needed|date=October 2022}} Newcomers to the city are concentrating around Skhidna St, with some toward Nova Uman area. In conjunction with this growth in the community, a new school of Yiddish was established.{{Citation needed|date = June 2013}}

===Pilgrimage to Rebbe Nachman's grave===
{{main|Rosh Hashana kibbutz}}
[[File:Ouman3.JPG|thumb|240px|The tomb of [[Nachman of Breslov]]]]
Every [[Rosh Hashana]], there is a major [[Rosh Hashana kibbutz|pilgrimage]] by tens of thousands of Hasidim and others from around the world to the burial site of Rebbe [[Nachman of Breslov]], located on the former site of the Jewish cemetery in a rebuilt [[synagogue]].<ref>David M. Gitlitz & Linda Kay Davidson ''Pilgrimage and the Jews'' (Westport: CT: Praeger, 2006), 115-117.</ref> Rebbe Nachman Me'Uman spent the last five months of his life in Uman,<ref>Kaplan, Aryeh (1985). "Until the Mashiach: Rabbi Nachman's biography: an annotated chronology". Jerusalem/New York: [[Breslov Research Institute]]. Chapter 24: Uman 5570 (1810).</ref> and specifically requested to be buried there. As believed by the Breslov Hasidim, before his death he solemnly promised to intercede on behalf of anyone who would come to pray on his grave on Rosh Hashana, "be he the worst of sinners"; thus, a pilgrimage to this grave provides the best chance of getting unscathed through the stern judgement which, according to Jewish faith, [[Hashem|God]] passes everybody on [[Yom Kippur]].<ref>
"Anyone in the world, be he the worst and most corrupt of sinners, would he come to my grave, give a penny to charity on my behalf and chant the Ten Mizmorim, then would I overturn the very Heavens on his behalf, and from the Most High of Heights would I descend to the Deepest Depths of Hell, to pull him out" (Breslov website (Hebrew) [http://vitaminim.org/1/index.php?topic=1918.0;wap2]).</ref>

The Rosh Hashana pilgrimage dates back to 1811, when the Rebbe's foremost disciple, [[Nathan of Breslov]], organized the first such pilgrimage on the Rosh Hashana after the Rebbe's death. The annual pilgrimage attracted hundreds of [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic Jews]] from [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]], [[Lithuania]] and [[Poland]] throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, until the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917 sealed the border between Russia and Poland. A handful of Soviet Hasidic Jews continued to make the pilgrimage clandestinely; some were discovered by the KGB and exiled to [[Siberia]], where they died.{{Citation needed|date = June 2013}} 

The pilgrimage ceased during [[World War II]] and resumed on a drastically smaller scale in 1948. From the 1960s until end of the [[Cold War]] in 1989, several hundred American and Israeli Hasidic Jews made their way to Uman, both legally and illegally, to pray at the grave of Rebbe Nachman. In 1988, the Soviets allowed 250 men to visit the Rebbe's grave for Rosh Hashana. In 1989, over 1,000 Hasidic Jews gathered in Uman for Rosh Hashana 1989. In 1990, 2,000 attended.<ref name="Rosh Hashana"/><ref>See the article "A New Phase in Jewish-Ukrainian Relations" by Mitsuharo Akao</ref> In 2008, attendance reached 25,000 men and boys.<ref>[http://jta.org/news/article/2008/10/02/110639/umanroshhashana "Hasidic Jews celebrate holiday in Uman"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100514065924/http://jta.org/news/article/2008/10/02/110639/umanroshhashana |date=2010-05-14 }} [[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]], 2008-10-02.

In the mid-2010s, Israelis from many sectors of Israel's Ultra-Orthodox community, including many [[Mizrahi Jewish]] rabbis, make the pilgrimage. The event brings together a wide variety of Orthodox society, from [[Yemenite Jewish|Yemenite]] yeshiva students, to former Israeli prison inmates, and American hippies.<ref name="jpost.com">[http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Rosh-Hashana-in-Uman-A-Jewish-anarchy-468990 Rosh Hashana in Uman: A Jewish anarchy] By NATAN ODENHEIMER, 10/02/2016, Jerusalem Post</ref> In 2022, following the [[2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine|Russian invasion of Ukraine]], the number of pilgrims coming to Uman for Jewish New Year was approximately 10,000, or about one-third of the number in 2021.<!-- per Hromadske text in the accompanying video --><ref name=hromadske20221004>[https://twitter.com/Hromadske/status/1577281883913822213 This year's Jewish New Year celebrations in Uman were unlike the previous years], [[Hromadske|Hromadske International]], via Twitter. 4 October 2022.</ref>
