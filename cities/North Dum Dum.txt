==History==
[[File:North Dumdum Municipality.jpg|thumb|North Dum Dum Municipality, [[Birati]]]]

In 1870, Dum Dum was divided into two parts named as North Dum Dum and South Dum Dum. Though North Dum Dum Municipality was established on 10 September, 1870. It comprised villages known as Birati, Nimta, Kadihati, Jangalpur Patna, Gouripur and a large area of what is now [[Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose International Airport]]. In 1998, Bisharpara gram panchayat and half of Sultanpur gram panchayat were merged with the Municipality.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://northdumdummunicipality.org/ | title = North Dum Dum municipality | work = About us  | publisher = NDDM | access-date = 11 June 2018}}</ref>

With the [[Partition of Bengal (1947)|partition of Bengal]] in 1947, "millions of refugees poured in from erstwhile [[East Pakistan]]."<ref>Chatterjee, Monideep, "Town Planning in Calcutta: Past, Present and Future",  in "Calcutta, The Living City" Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Page 142, First published 1990, 2005 edition, {{ISBN|0-19-563697-X}}</ref> In the initial stages bulk of the refugees were non-agriculturists. A few of them made their own arrangements, but "it was squatters who made the [[East Bengali refugees]] famous or infamous." Squatting (''jabardakhal'' in Bengali) ranged from the forcible occupation of barracks to the collective take-over of private, government and waste land. By 1949, there were 65 refugee colonies in the Dum Dum and Panihati zone. The squatters were in a way “self-settlers” in the absence of adequate official arrangements for rehabilitation. Within a very short time the refugees (quite often with government/ administrative support) not only found a place to stay but developed a society with markets, schools, temples and sometimes even colleges, hospitals and recreational centres.<ref>Chatterjee, Nilanjana, "The East Bengal Refugees: A Lesson in Survival",  in "Calcutta, The Living City" Vol II, Edited by Sukanta Chaudhuri, Pages 72-75, First published 1990, 2005 edition, {{ISBN|0-19-563697-X}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271664458 |title   =The Myths Refugees Live By Memory and History of the Making of Bengali Refugee Identity |first=Uditi|last=Sen|journal =  Modern Asian Studies|year =2014 |volume =48 |pages =37–76 |doi =10.1017/S0026749X12000613 |s2cid =144297665 | access-date = 5 March 2018}}</ref>
