==History==
===Modern Syria (1946–2011)===
On November 17, 1957, during the presidency of [[Shukri al-Quwatli]], Al-Rashid Governorate, named after [[Harun al-Rashid]], was carved out from the adjacent [[Deir ez-Zor Governorate]]. Subsequently, on January 1, 1970, the Governorate's name was changed to Raqqa Governorate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://parliament.gov.sy/arabic/index.php?node=201&nid=9806&RID=-1&Last=9663&First=80&CurrentPage=97&Vld=-1&Mode=&Service=&Loc1=&Key1=&SDate=&EDate=&Year=&or=%20ORDER%20BY%20%20service%20DESC&Country=&Num=-1&Dep=-1&src=203&|title=الاستعاضة عن اسم محافظة الرشيد باسم محافظة الرقة|website=parliament.gov.sy|language=ar}}</ref>

===Syrian Civil War (2011-present)===
As of 19 September 2012, the town of [[Tal Abyad]], directly across the border from the Turkish town of Akçakale, was already under rebel control{{which|date=October 2014}}.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/08/world/middleeast/rebels-clash-with-syrian-security-forces-near-lebanon.html | work=The New York Times | first=Anne | last=Barnard | title=Rebels Clash With Syrian Security Forces Near Lebanon | date=2012-10-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/syria-crisis-idUSL5E8KJ8NR20120919?type=marketsNews |title=WRAPUP 3-Syrian rebels extend grip on Turkish border |publisher=Reuters |date= 2012-09-19|access-date=2012-10-10}}</ref>

On 11 February 2013, Syrian rebels, including [[al-Nusra]] fighters, took control of the [[Tabqa Dam]], and [[Al-Thawrah|Tabqa city]], according to SOHR and videos posted by rebels. Tabqa Dam, on the [[Euphrates]] river, is the largest hydroelectric dam in Syria and provides electricity to many areas, including [[Aleppo]]. Tabqa is also known as Thawrah.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/middleeast/syrian-insurgents-claim-to-control-large-hydropower-dam.html?ref=middleeast | work=The New York Times | first1=Hwaida | last1=Saad | author-link=Hwaida Saad | first2=Rick | last2=Gladstone | title=Syrian Insurgents Claim to Control Large Hydropower Dam | date=2013-02-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2013/02/12/syrian-rebels-capture-countrys-largest-dam |title=Syrian rebels advance toward Aleppo airport - ''U.S. News & World Report'' |publisher=Usnews.com |date=2013-02-12 |access-date=2013-09-18}}</ref>

As of September 2014, governance has been fully reestablished with previous personnel who pledge allegiance to the new regime. Only the police and soldiers are ISIL fighters, who receive confiscated lodging previously{{dubious|date=October 2014}} owned by non-Sunnis and others who fled. ISIL asserts that it is providing welfare services, that it has established price controls, and that it has imposed taxes on the wealthy. The Raqqa Dam continued to provide electricity and water. The exportation of oil brought in tens of millions of dollars.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-syria-crisis-raqqa-insight-idUSKBN0GZ0D120140904|title=In northeast Syria, Islamic State builds a government|newspaper=Reuters|date=4 September 2014|author=Mariam Karouny}}</ref>

As of July 2017, the [[Syrian Democratic Forces]] occupy the majority of the province, including the city of Raqqa, which they [[Battle of Raqqa (2017)|have captured from ISIL following a months-long siege]]. A few months before the capture of Raqqa, the Syrian government launched the [[Southern Raqqa offensive (June 2017)|Southern Raqqa offensive]], which cleared southern Raqqa and southeastern [[Aleppo Governorate|Aleppo]] from [[ISIL]] militants. With the south part of the governorate under government control and the northern part under [[Rojava]], the governorate has been fully cleared from ISIL.
