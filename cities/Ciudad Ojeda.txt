==History==
[[Image:Ciudad Ojeda "Plaza Alonso de Oejda".jpg|250px|thumb|left|Alonso de Ojeda Square.]]
Ciudad Ojeda was founded on January 19, 1937, by President [[Eleazar López Contreras]] as a settlement for the inhabitants of Lagunillas de Aguas<ref>[http://www.efemeridesvenezolanas.com/html/ojeda.htm La Fundación de Ciudad Ojeda<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Today, it is a major center for the [[oil and gas industry]] in the [[Lake Maracaibo]] region.

On November 13, 1939, a terrible fire destroyed Lagunillas de Agua, causing over 200 fatalities. There are several hypotheses about the cause of the fire that prompted the final and decisive transfer of population to the mainland. The truth is that the oil industry was an oily layer on the lake, which had the potential to ignite the wooden houses built on stilts in the lake. One hypothesis is the accidental fall of a kerosene lamp to the lake from the Bar Caracas. Another is a fire caused by an oil company when he was going to beat his concession, that company helped reconstruction and retained the award after all, there is no evidence of this fact.<ref>[[:es:Lagunillas de Agua]]</ref>
