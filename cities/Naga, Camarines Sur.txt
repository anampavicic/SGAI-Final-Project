==Etymology==
[[File:Lignum nephriticum - cup of Philippine lignum nephriticum, Pterocarpus indicus, and flask containing its fluorescent solution Hi.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Lignum nephriticum]]'' cup made of [[Pterocarpus indicus|narra]] wood (the namesake of the province) produced opalescent colors when water is poured into it. These wooden cups were a major pre-colonial and colonial industry of Naga.]]
Naga is the native pre-colonial name of the city. It is named after the [[Pterocarpus indicus|narra]] tree (''[[Pterocarpus indicus]]''), which is known as ''naga'' in the [[Bikol language]]. It was abundant in the region and was part of a pre-colonial industry of wooden cups and bowls made from narra that produced distinctive blue and yellow opalescent colors when water is poured into them (later known to Europeans as ''[[lignum nephriticum]]''). During the [[Spanish colonial period of the Philippines|Spanish colonial era]], they were exported to [[Mexico]] as luxury goods for their purported [[diuretic]] properties via the [[Manila galleons|Manila-Acapulco Galleons]], and from there, to [[Europe]]. They were often presented as gifts to European nobility.<ref name="saff">{{cite book|author= Safford, William Edwin|title =Annual report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution|chapter =''Lignum nephriticum''|location=Washington|publisher =Government Printing Office|year =1916|page=271&ndash;298|chapter-url =https://archive.org/download/annualreportofbo1915smitfo/annualreportofbo1915smitfo.pdf|author-link =William Edwin Safford}}</ref><ref name="lignum">{{Cite journal | last1 = Muyskens | first1 = M. | doi = 10.1021/ed083p765 | last2 = Ed Vitz | title = The Fluorescence of ''Lignum nephriticum'': A Flash Back to the Past and a Simple Demonstration of Natural Substance Fluorescence | journal = Journal of Chemical Education | volume = 83 | issue = 5 | pages = 765 | year = 2006 | bibcode = 2006JChEd..83..765M }}</ref>

The [[Jesuit]] [[missionary]] and historian Juan José Delgado (1697-1755) describes the industry in the following:

{{Blockquote
|text=<p>The city called Nueva Cáceres by the Spaniards bears among the natives the name Naga, on account of the abundance of this tree throughout those provinces of Camarines and Albay, where they carve very curious cups out of it for drinking water. Those made of female naga (pale white wood) are much the better, for this wood tinges the water very quickly to a celestial color, more quickly than the male (reddish wood). These cups are much esteemed in Europe and are regarded as a gift well worthy of any prince. Out of one of these cups they made me drink when I was a child, in [[Cadiz]] (Spain), as a remedy for [[hydropsy]] and [[constipation|oppilation]], and I think that it might have helped me had I not drunk too much.</p>

==History==

===Precolonial era===
The Bicolandia was closely allied with the [[Kedatuan of Madja-as]] Confederation, which was located southeast on [[Panay Island]]. According to the epic ''[[Maragtas]]'', two [[datu]]s and their followers, who followed Datu Puti, arrived at [[Taal Lake]], with one group later settling around [[Laguna de Bay]], and another group pushing southward into the Bicol Peninsula, placing the Bicolanos between people from [[Luzon]] and people from the [[Visayas]]. An ancient tomb preserved among the Bicolanos, discovered and examined by anthropologists during the 1920s, refers to some of the same deities and personages mentioned in the ''[[Maragtas]]''.<ref name="G. Nye Steiger 1929, p. 122">G. Nye Steiger, H. Otley Beyer, Conrado Benitez, ''A History of the Orient'', Oxford: 1929, Ginn and Company, p. 122.</ref>

===Spanish colonial period===
{{main|Nueva Cáceres}}
[[File:Claveria visit to NC Feb 16 1845.jpg|thumb|left|Visit of Gov.-Gen Narciso Claveria y Zaldua at Nueva Caceres in Feb 16, 1845. Painting by Honorato Lozano]]
In 1573, on his second expedition to this region, the [[conquistador]] [[Juan de Salcedo]] landed in a settlement named Naga in the native languages, because of the abundance of [[Angsana|narra trees]] (''naga'' in [[Bikol languages|Bikol]]).

In 1575, Captain Pedro de Chávez, the commander of the garrison left behind by Salcedo, founded on the site of the present business centre (across the river from the original Naga) a Spanish city which he named La Ciudad de Cáceres, in honor of [[Francisco de Sande]], the [[Governor-General of the Philippines|Governor-General]] and a native of [[Cáceres, Spain|Cáceres]] in Spain. Nueva Caceres, had 30 Spanish Households then.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.530346/2015.530346.jesuits-in_djvu.txt "Jesuits In The Philippines (1581-1768)" Page 59]
"These settlements were much smaller than Manila. In 1582 Manila had 
an adult male population of 300 Spaniards; Vigan, 60; Nueva Caceres, 
30; Cebu, 70; Arevalo, 20. In 1586 Manila had 329 Spanish men and 
youths capable of bearing arms ; the most recently established settlement, Nueva Segovia in Cagayan, had 97; Nueva Caceres, 69; Arevalo, 65; Cavite, 64; Cebu, 63; Villa Fernandina, 19.</ref>

It was by this name of "Nueva Caceres" that it was identified in the [[papal bull]] of August 14, 1595, which established the see of Cáceres, together with [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cebu|Cebú]] and [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Nueva Segovia|Nueva Segovia]], and made it the seat of the new bishopric subject to the [[Archdiocese of Manila]]. Nueva Caceres was settled by around 100 Spaniards from Europe<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.gutenberg.org/files/38269/38269-h/38269-h.htm#xd19e3408| title = A History of the Philippines by David P. Barrows| quote = The City of Nueva Caceres, in the Camarines, was founded by Governor La-Sande. It, too, was the seat of a bishopric, and had one hundred Spanish inhabitants.}}</ref> and reinforced by migrations from [[Latin American Asian|Mexico]].

In time, the Spanish city and the native village merged into one community and became popularly known as "Nueva Cáceres", to distinguish it from its namesake in Spain. It had a city government as prescribed by Spanish law, with an ''[[ayuntamiento]]'' and ''[[Cabildo (council)|cabildo]]'' of its own. At the beginning of the 17th century, there were only five other ''ciudades'' in the [[Philippines]]. Nueva Cáceres remained the capital of the Ambos Camarines provinces and later of Camarines Sur province until the formal creation of the independent chartered city of Naga under a sovereign Philippines.

For hundreds of years during the Spanish colonial era, Naga grew to become the center of trade, education, and culture, and the seat of ecclesiastical jurisdiction in Bicol.

===Liberation (1898)===
Under the commands of Corporals Elias Angeles and Felix Plazo, [[Civil Guard (Philippines)|revolutionaries]] planned a [[Liberation of Nueva Cáceres (1898)|revolt]] against the Spanish on September 18, 1898. Gunfire rang out until 5 a.m., and the remaining Spaniards sought shelter at the convent of San Francisco Church. When the Spaniards could no longer withstand the pressure, they signed a peace treaty at the [[Universidad de Sta. Isabel|University of Sta. Isabel]], a school. The aforementioned "peace treaty" is displayed at the USI Museum.

This revolt marked a turning point in Naga City's history, bringing an end to over 323 years of [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish rule]] since the founding of [[Nueva Cáceres]]. A city ordinance, passed by the Naga City Government, designates September 19th as Liberation Day in the City of Naga. This is ordinance number 2006-050. The ordinance also outlines activities for commemorating Liberation Day and allocates funds to support them.<ref>https://www2.naga.gov.ph/culture-and-heritage-and-naming-of-streets/.

With the advent of American rule, the city was reduced to a municipality. In 1919, it lost its Spanish name and became officially known as Naga.

====World War II and Japanese occupation====
Naga came under Japanese occupation on December 18, 1941, following the [[Japanese invasion of Legaspi]] a few days earlier.<ref name="Hyper">{{cite web|title=The First Landings|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USA/USA-P-PI/USA-P-PI-6.html|access-date=March 18, 2014}}</ref>

In 1945, toward the end of World War II, combined U.S. and Philippine Commonwealth troops—of the [[United States Army]], [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]], [[Philippine Constabulary]], as well as Bicolano guerrilla resistance groups—liberated Naga from Imperial Japanese troops.

===Religion===

====Roman Catholicism====
[[File:Peñafrancia Basilica Minore.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peñafrancia Basilica|Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Peñafrancia]]]]
The city is the ecclesiastical seat of the [[Archdiocese of Caceres]], which oversees the Catholic population in the [[Bicol Region]], whose archbishop is the [[Primate (bishop)|primate]] of the region. This dominant faith is supported by the presence of old and influential Catholic institutions, from universities to churches run by different [[religious institute]]s, notably the [[Ateneo de Naga University]] by the [[Jesuits]]; the [[Universidad de Santa Isabel]] by the [[Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul|Daughters of Charity]]; the [[Naga Cathedral|Naga Metropolitan Cathedral]], which is the oldest cathedral that is still standing in [[Luzon]] outside [[Metro Manila]]; [[Peñafrancia Basilica Minore]], which is the largest Catholic structure in southern Luzon in terms of size and land area; [[Our Lady of Peñafrancia Shrine]]; the historic [[San Francisco Church (Intramuros)|San Francisco Church]]; and Peñafrancia Museum.

====Other Christian faiths====
Protestant denominations in the city include [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventist]]s and [[Bible Baptist]]s, whose churches are located along Magsaysay Avenue, while other Protestants attend the Methodist Church which is among the old structures along Peñafrancia Avenue.

The ''[[Assemblies of God]]'' maintains a fast-growing ministry in Naga. Aside from Naga Bethel Church (formerly Naga Bethel Temple), which is located on Felix Plazo Street, other local congregations are Philippians Christian Fellowship (in barangays San Felipe), Gethsemane Christian Ministries (in Carolina), and outreach ministries in other barangays.

The largest minority religion in Naga is [[Iglesia ni Cristo]] (INC). INC has several chapels in different barangays in the city, and the local congregation is the largest in the district.  It is followed by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (formerly known as "Mormon") which has several congregations (wards) with their main church building situated along Panganiban Drive not far from the INC's.

There is also a concentration of [[Jesus Miracle Crusade]] ministries in the city.

====Other religions====
[[File:Taoist Temple along Naga River.jpg|right|thumb|Taoist Temple along Naga river]]

[[Muslim]]s, [[Sikhism|Sikhs]], and [[Taoism|Taoists]] can also be found in the city.

===Language===
The Coastal Bikol-Central dialect of the Coastal [[Bikol languages|Bikol language]] is the dominant dialect spoken by the population in Naga.<ref name="NagaDemography">{{cite web |title=Demography |url=http://naga.gov.ph/uncategorized/demography/ |website=Naga City |access-date=April 4, 2019}}</ref> Central Standard Bikol is also the basis for other dialects in the [[Bicol Region]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Useful Filipino Words – Bicol Translations |url=http://www.camsurguidedelights.com/useful-filipino-words-bicol-translations/ |date=2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427010026/http://www.camsurguidedelights.com/useful-filipino-words-bicol-translations/ |archive-date=April 27, 2014 |website=Cam Sur Guide Delights |access-date=April 4, 2019}}</ref> The majority of the city's population can understand and speak English, [[Filipino language|Filipino]], and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. Because of the influx of people from the Rinconada area that are studying in different universities, [[Rinconada Bikol language|Rinconada Bikol]] can also be heard in different schools and throughout the city. Some Nagueños have varying degrees of proficiency with Rinconada Bikol, since the southern half of Pili, which is the boundary between Rinconada Bikol and Coastal Bikol speakers, is just few kilometers away from Naga. Although the main language is Bikol, and the medium of instruction in school is English, people in Naga usually tell time and count in Spanish.

====Isarog Agta Language====
In 2010, [[UNESCO]] released its 3rd volume of ''[[Atlas of the World's Languages in Danger]]'', where three critically [[endangered language]]s were in the Philippines. One of these is the ''Isarog Agta'' language, of the Isarog Agta people, who live on Mount Isarog and are one of the original Negrito settlers in the Philippines, belonging to the [[Aeta people]] classification but with language and belief systems unique to their own culture and heritage.

Only five Isarog Agta spoke their indigenous language in the year 2000. The language was classified as "Critically Endangered", meaning the youngest speakers are grandparents and older, speak the language partially and infrequently, and hardly pass the language to their children and grandchildren. If the remaining 150 Isarog Agta do not pass their native language to the next generation, it will be extinct within one to two decades.

==Economy==
