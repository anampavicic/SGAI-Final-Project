[[File:ISS047-E-84351 Cape Coral, Florida (annotated).jpg|thumb|right|Cape Coral from the International Space Station, 2016]]

'''Cape Coral''' is a city  in [[Lee County, Florida]], United States, on the [[Gulf of Mexico]]. Founded in 1957, the city's population had grown to 194,016 as of the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], a 26% increase from 154,309 at the 2010 census, making it the [[List of municipalities in Florida|ninth-most populous city]] in Florida. With an area of {{convert|120|sqmi|km2}}, Cape Coral is the largest city between [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]] and [[Miami]] in both population and area. It is the largest and principal city in the [[Cape Coral-Fort Myers|Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Florida Metropolitan Statistical Area]]. The city has over {{convert|400|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of navigable waterways, more than any other city on earth.

==History==
The original inhabitants around the Cape Coral area were the [[Calusa]]. After Florida became a state in 1845, multiple pioneers started selling and buying land in what is now Cape Coral under the [[Homestead Act]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Chestnut |first=Cathy |title=Cape Coral has plenty of history, pioneers and stories |date=July 13, 2014 |url=https://www.news-press.com/story/news/local/cape-coral/2014/07/13/cape-coral-plenty-history-pioneers-stories/12568221/ |work=News-Press |location=Fort Myers, Florida}}</ref> Cape Coral's modern history began in 1957 when two brothers from [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], Leonard and Jack Rosen, flew over the peninsula known as Redfish Point, across the [[Caloosahatchee River]] near present-day [[Fort Myers, Florida|Fort Myers]]. The brothers, who were real estate developers, purchased a {{convert|103|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} tract with a small group of partners for $678,000 and in 1958 began development of the city as a planned community.<ref name=founded>{{Cite web|title=History of Cape Coral|url=https://capecoralmuseum.org/history-of-cape-coral/|website=capecoralmuseum.org}}</ref>

The [[Gulf American Land Corporation|Gulf American Land Corporation (GALC)]] was formed to develop the area. GALC developed a marketing model that was a departure from traditional selling methods. Approval was secured from Lee County to master-plan the entire property into lots. Instead of listing the lots with real estate agents, GALC developed the land sales, dinner-party model, operating from banquet rooms in local hotels. People were invited to attend by offering a free dinner for two. The model, referred to as team-selling, allowed for a well-trained team to close deals in 90 minutes. Buyers would sign a contract and agree to come to the property within six months and cancel if not satisfied. Ezio Valentini, an Italian real estate developer, joined GALC and became director of sales. The program was so successful that offices were opened in 24 states, and an arrangement was made with an airline to charter flights to fly buyers to the property.

Instead of borrowing from banks and lenders, the developers factored the sales contracts to pay for building the infrastructure. [[Canal]]s were dug, streets paved, houses and businesses built.<ref>Newsday, [http://www.robertcaro.com/journalism/in-florida-the-pitch-is-high-and-hard/ "In Florida, the Pitch Is High and Hard"], Robert A. Caro, 1963</ref> Cape Coral was promoted like no other Florida development. Celebrities were brought in to tout the benefits of "the Cape", as it is known locally. The first building in Cape Coral was the Rosens' sales office. It was built where George's Auto now stands, at Cape Coral and Coronado Parkways.<ref name=":0" /> Cape Coral's first permanent resident was Kenny Schwartz, the Rosens' general manager.<ref>[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/obituaries/article1983652.html Miami Herald: "Real estate executive and Jewish leader Kenneth Schwartz dies at 88" By Carli Teproff] August 28, 2014</ref> Cape Coral's first four homes were completed in May 1958, on Riverside and Flamingo Drives.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Historical Photos |publisher=Cape Coral Historical Museum |access-date=October 9, 2008 |url=http://www.capecoralhistoricalmuseum.org/page8.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204084033/http://www.capecoralhistoricalmuseum.org/page8.html |archive-date=December 4, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

Development continued through the early 1960s, mostly on Redfish Point, south of Cape Coral Parkway. By 1963, the population was 2,850; 1,300 buildings had been finished or were under construction; {{convert|80|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of road had been built, and {{convert|160|mi|-1|abbr=on}} of canals had been dug.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The public yacht club, a golf course, medical clinic and shopping center were up and running. A major addition for Cape Coral was the construction of the {{convert|3,400|ft|m}} long [[Cape Coral Bridge]] across the Caloosahatchee River, which opened in early 1964. Before the bridge, a trip to Fort Myers was more than {{convert|20|mi|0|abbr=on}} via Del Prado Boulevard and over the [[Edison Bridge (Florida)|Edison Bridge]] to cross the river.

The city incorporated on August 18, 1970,<ref name=CCInc>{{Cite web|title=Cape Coral Celebrates the 50th Anniversary of Incorporation|url=https://www.capecoral.gov/news_detail_T13_R206.php|website=capecoral.gov}}</ref> and its population continued to grow rapidly until the real estate slowdown that gripped the region beginning in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=August 2023}} On September 28, 2022, Cape Coral suffered major damage when [[Hurricane Ian]] made landfall nearby.

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|120|sqmi|km2|1}}, of which {{convert|110.09|sqmi|km2|1}} is land and {{convert|9.91|sqmi|km2|1}} (9%) is water.<ref name=censusarea>{{Cite journal|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GCTTable?_bm=y&-geo_id=04000US12&-_box_head_nbr=GCT-PH1&-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U&-format=ST-7 |title=Florida by Place.

Fort Myers lies across the Caloosahatchee River to the east, and [[Matlacha, Florida|Matlacha]] and [[Pine Island (Lee County, Florida)|Pine Island]] lie across Matlacha Pass to the west. Matlacha Pass is home to [[Matlacha Pass National Wildlife Refuge]] and the Matlacha Pass Aquatic Preserve.<ref>Encyclopædia Britannica.

===Flora and fauna===
The area supports [[Anseriformes|waterfowl]], [[Wader|wading birds]], migrant [[songbird]]s, [[Gopherus|gopher tortoises]], dolphins and reptiles. Rotary Park is home to wading birds, [[Bird of prey|raptors]], [[Butterfly|butterflies]], foxes and other wildlife. Nature enthusiasts can track exotic birds and native fish from the boardwalk at Lake Kennedy and watch the [[West Indian manatee]]s at Sirenia Vista Park. Cape Coral is home to the largest population of [[burrowing owl]]s in Florida.<ref>[http://www.capecoral.net/ City of Cape Coral] Official site</ref>

===Invasive species===
Cape Coral is home to three [[invasive species]], the [[green iguana]], the [[Ctenosaura|spiny-tailed iguana]], and the [[Nile monitor]], which was discovered in 2009. The iguanas are found throughout southern Florida and generally do not pose a threat. The Nile monitor is however a large (3–7&nbsp;feet), fast traveling, fast swimming carnivore with a wide diet, which can include fish, fowl, and small mammals. The city's many waterways work against its capture and provide an easy transportation route around the city.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/wildlife/article1011745.ece |title=St. Petersburg Times/TampaBay.com, Sunday, June 21, 2009. |access-date=May 7, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425121020/http://www.tampabay.com/news/environment/wildlife/article1011745.ece |archive-date=April 25, 2010 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===Climate===
The city features a borderline [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Aw'''), bordering on a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]]: '''Am'''). The area averages 355 days of sunshine per year and experiences precipitation on 145 days per year. While the [[wet season]] (May to October) is hot and humid with rather erratic tropical downpours, [[dry season]]s (November to April) tend to be pleasantly warm and see only sporadic precipitation. The city receives about 56&nbsp;inches of rain each year, the majority of which falls from June to September. During the summer months, afternoon thunderstorms are heavy yet brief. The city is affected by the annual hurricane season, which begins officially on June 1 and continues through November.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhc.noaa.gov/climo/#targetText=The%20official%20hurricane%20season%20for,anytime%20in%20the%20hurricane%20season.|title=Tropical Cyclone Climatology|website=www.nhc.noaa.gov|access-date=2019-10-26}}</ref>
