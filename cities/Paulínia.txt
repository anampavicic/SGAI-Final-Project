'''Paulínia''' is a Brazilian municipality in the interior of the state of [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]. It is located in the northwest of the [[São Paulo Macrometropolis]] and is about 119&nbsp;km from the [[São Paulo|state capital]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Distâncias entre a cidade de São Paulo e todas as cidades do interior paulista |url=http://www.emsampa.com.br/xspxspint.htm |access-date=2011-01-27}}</ref> It occupies an area of 139&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup><ref>{{Cite web |last=IBGE |title=Área territorial oficial de Paulínia |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/geociencias/areaterritorial/area.php?nome=Paul%EDnia&codigo=&submit.x=37&submit.y=4 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wRxoNLXW?url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/home/geociencias/areaterritorial/area.php?nome=Paul%EDnia&codigo=&submit.x=37&submit.y=4 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-02-12 |access-date=2010-12-05 |publisher=Resolução da Presidência do IBGE de n° 5 (R.PR-5/02) |publication-date=2020-10-10}}</ref> and in 2018, [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics|IBGE]] estimated its population at 106,776.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Estimativa populacional 2018 IBGE |url=https://cidades.ibge.gov.br/brasil/sp/paulinia/panorama |access-date=2019-05-24 |publisher=Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística (IBGE) |publication-date=2018-08-29}}</ref> It was emancipated on February 28, 1964, but its foundation dates back to the beginning of the 20th century. The town is named after José Paulino Nogueira, a well-known farmer in the Campinas region, the municipality from which Paulínia emancipated and who lent his name to the railroad station around which the town developed.<ref name=":2" /> It is located in the [[Rio de Janeiro–São Paulo megalopolis|Rio-São Paulo axis]], serving as a link between [[Greater São Paulo]] and cities in the area, such as [[Cosmópolis]], [[Artur Nogueira]], and [[Conchal]].

It is known for hosting one of the largest petrochemical poles in [[Latin America]], centered on the Paulínia Refinery ([[Refinaria do Planalto Paulista|Replan]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Replan Refinery, Brazil|url=http://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/projects/replan-refinery/|website=Hydrocarbons-technology.com|publisher=Kable|access-date=10 August 2014}}</ref><ref name=":13">{{Cite book |last=Vinícius Caldeira Brant, Alvaro A.

The municipality is formed by the city of Paulínia and the district of Betel, in the eastern region. Paulínia is part of the so-called Extended Metropolitan Complex, which exceeds 29 million inhabitants, approximately 75% of the population of the entire state of São Paulo. The metropolitan regions of Campinas and São Paulo already form the first megalopolis in the [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]], uniting 65 municipalities that together are home to 12% of the Brazilian population.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A primeira macrometrópole do hemisfério sul |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/megacidades/sp_mancha.shtm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121205013544/http://www.estadao.com.br/megacidades/sp_mancha.shtm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-12-05 |access-date=2011-02-12 |publisher=Jornal Estadão}}</ref>

== Etymology ==
[[File:Jose Paulino Nogueira.JPG|left|thumb|José Paulino Nogueira, from whom the name Paulínia derived.]]
The term Paulínia pays homage to José Paulino Nogueira, a farmer from Campineiro, one of the owners of Funil farm, located between the present-day cities of Paulínia and [[Cosmópolis]]. The village that gave rise to the city of Paulínia was called José Paulino Village until 1944, when a state decree prohibited localities from having names of living people.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Müller |first=Meire Terezinha |title=Paulínia - História e Memória - dos Trilhos da Carril às Chamas do Progresso |year=2006 |isbn=9788575822685 |editor-last=Komedi |editor-first=Maria das Dores Soares |location=Paulínia}}</ref> Due to this fact, the village was elevated to a district with the name "Paulínia".<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Pró-Memória de Campinas-SP |title=José Paulino Nogueira |url=http://eptv.globo.com/blogs/promemoriacampinas/2007/personagem-jose-paulino-nogueira/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240525051744/https://www.webcitation.org/5wRzyOeFM?url=http://eptv.globo.com/blogs/promemoriacampinas/2007/personagem-jose-paulino-nogueira/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2024-05-25 |access-date=2011-02-12 |publisher=EPTV.com (WebCite)}}</ref>

José Paulino was born on February 13, 1853, in Campinas. At the end of the [[Empire of Brazil|Empire]], as a member of the [[Republican Party of São Paulo]], he was elected an alderman in his hometown, alongside [[Júlio de Mesquita]] and Salvador Penteado. In March 1889, when there was an outbreak of [[yellow fever]] in [[Campinas]], José Paulino was one of the few authorities who did not abandon the city; he fought the disease and became loved by the people of Campinas.<ref name=":1" /> At the end of the 19th century, Paulino and his brothers started to clear the way for Funil farm, between Paulínia and Cosmópolis. With the construction of the Funilense Railroad, a railroad station was also built in the São Bento neighborhood, which became known as José Paulino. The small neighborhood of São Bento grew up around the station and also became known as José Paulino. Due to the decree that prohibited names of living people in localities, upon its elevation to district José Paulino was renamed Paulínia.<ref name=":0" />

==History==
Paulínia's history begins long before its emancipation, which occurred in 1964; it goes back to the beginning of the 16th century, with the beginning of the occupation of the Campinas region.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Prefeitura de Paulínia |title=Principais Fatos Históricos e Políticos do Município de Paulínia, até 1970 |url=http://www.paulinia.sp.gov.br/historia.aspx |access-date=2010-02-21}}</ref>

=== Origins ===
During the 18th century, the region of Campinas began to be occupied due to the passage of the ''[[bandeirantes]]'' routes that headed for the gold mines in the interior of Brazil. The settlement began more precisely in the period between 1739 and 1744, when Captain [[Francisco Barreto Leme do Prado]] arrived at the then parish of ''Nossa Senhora de Conceição de Campinas''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nosso São Paulo |title=Campinas - SP |url=http://www.nossosaopaulo.com.br/Reg_10/Reg10_Campinas.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120905055200/http://www.nossosaopaulo.com.br/Reg_10/Reg10_Campinas.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-05 |access-date=2011-02-12 |publisher=WebCite}}</ref>

The history of Paulínia as an urban agglomeration begins with the donation of [[Sesmaria|''sesmarias'']] by the Portuguese government. There are reports of the donation of two large ''sesmarias'' in the region of the [[Atibaia River|Atibaia]] and [[Jaguari River (Paraíba do Sul)|Jaguari]] rivers, where the city of Paulínia is located today, one in 1796 and another, called the Morro Azul ''sesmaria'', in 1807. From the latter originated the São Bento farm, acquired by Comendador Francisco de Paula Camargo, and the Funil farm; both have a great connection with the establishment of Paulínia.<ref name=":0" /> Officially Paulínia was founded on July 16, 1906, by José Seixas de Queiroz; however, the city's anniversary is celebrated on the date the municipality was created, February 28.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Associação Paulista de Municípios |title=História de Paulínia |url=http://www.apaulista.org.br/apm/municipio/historia.asp?iIdMun=100135413 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110212210806/http://www.apaulista.org.br/apm/municipio/historia.asp?iIdMun=100135413 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-02-12 |access-date=2010-09-05 |publisher=WebCite}}</ref>

Paulínia's population was formed mainly by [[Italian Brazilians|Italian immigrants]], who replaced the slaves that worked on the farms after the abolition of slavery in 1888.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |last=Rene Sarli |title=História da cidade de Paulínia |url=http://www.conhecapaulinia.com.br/a-cidade/historia-de-paulinia |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121231101512/http://www.conhecapaulinia.com.br/a-cidade/historia-de-paulinia |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-12-31 |access-date=2011-02-12 |publisher=onheça Paulínia (WebCite)}}</ref> However, with the economic growth, the city has become a destination for many immigrants from neighboring cities and other parts of Brazil, especially from the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast]], who are looking for work<ref>{{Cite web |title=Paulínia atrai mão de obra de todo o País |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,paulinia-atrai-mao-de-obra-de-todo-o-pais-,962921,0.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121121110153/http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,paulinia-atrai-mao-de-obra-de-todo-o-pais-,962921,0.htm |archive-date=2012-11-21 |access-date=2013-10-27}}</ref> or better living conditions.<ref name=":16">{{Cite web |last=Ariosto Holanda |title=Refinaria: uma luta de irmãos nordestinos |url=http://www.fiec.org.br/artigos/energia/Refinaria_uma_luta_de_irm%E3os_nordestinos.htm |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121130011213/http://www.fiec.org.br/artigos/energia/Refinaria_uma_luta_de_irm%E3os_nordestinos.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-11-30 |access-date=2011-08-14 |publisher=Jornal O POVO |publication-date=2003-02-15}}</ref>

=== From village to district ===
[[File:Trabalhadores estrada de ferro Paulinia.JPG|left|thumb|Workers from the surrounding farms cleared the way for the railroad.]]
The first urban center in the region of Paulínia was a village called São Bento where, in 1903, a chapel was inaugurated in honor of the same saint, which had begun to be built in 1897, the same year in which the plans and budget for the José Paulino station were approved. Around this chapel the São Bento neighborhood began to develop. At this time São Bento was a suburb of Campinas.<ref name=":2" />

Due to the expansion of the agricultural culture, the farmers of the region started to feel difficulties in draining their production due to the presence of the Atibaia and Jaguari rivers, which made it difficult for them to cross with the products. In this context, the producers started to demand from the [[captaincy of São Paulo]] the construction of a railroad that would make it possible to transport their production to other centers. In 1880 credits were approved for the construction of the Companhia Carril Agrícola Funilense, connecting the city of Campinas to the region of Funil farm.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Valente, Fernanda Marques; Michele Carneiro e Thaís Bezerra |title=Abrindo caminho em nome do progresso |url=http://portaltribuna.com/portal/ |access-date=2006-04-02 |website=Revista Tribuna |publisher=Grupo Tribuna de Paulínia |publication-place=Paulínia}}</ref>

The inauguration of the carriage section of the Funilense Railroad, on September 18, 1899, changed the economic order of the São Bento neighborhood. The José Paulino Station attracted many merchants to the neighborhood and gave rise to José Paulino Village, the result of the development of the São Bento neighborhood. Around the station there was Comércio Street, later renamed [[José Paulino Avenue]], and a replica of the chapel of the São Bento farm, the [[Benedict of Nursia|São Bento]] Church, which still exists today. On November 30, 1944, through Decree-Law 14334, José Paulino was elevated to a district with the name Paulínia.<ref name=":0" />

=== From district to municipality ===
Paulínia remained a district of Campinas for twenty years. During this period the agricultural and industrial development reached the whole region, mainly with the installation of Rhodia in São Francisco farm in 1942. This fact represented an increase in tax collection for Campinas. In the mid-1950s, a retired employee from the [[Legislative Assembly of São Paulo]], José Lozano Araújo, founded the Friends of Paulínia association and started a movement for the emancipation of Paulínia. The movement culminated with the holding of a plebiscite on November 6, 1963, which determined emancipation. On February 28, 1964, Law 8092 was published,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Assembleia Legislativa do Estado de São Paulo |title=Lei Nº 8.092, de 28 de fevereiro de 1964 |url=http://www.al.sp.gov.br/repositorio/legislacao/lei/1964/lei%20n.8.092,%20de%2028.02.1964.htm |access-date=2009-05-02}}</ref> creating the town of Paulínia.<ref name=":0" />

The first elections took place on March 7, 1965, and José Lozano Araújo was elected. He was responsible for major works in the city and for the installation of [[Refinaria do Planalto Paulista|Replan]] on the site, as he donated the land and exempted it from taxes for twenty years.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web |title=História de Paulínia |url=http://www.paulinia.sp.gov.br/historia.aspx |access-date=2020-02-21 |publisher=Prefeitura de Paulínia}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=IBGE Cidades |title=História de Paulínia |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/historicos_cidades/historico_conteudo.php?codmun=353650 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121127153907/http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/historicos_cidades/historico_conteudo.php?codmun=353650 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-11-27 |access-date=2011-08-01}}</ref> The refinery transformed Paulínia into a population attraction center, growing from 6,900 inhabitants in 1972 to 28,620 in 1973, tripling the number of inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Façanha, Cristiane; Michele Carneiro |title=Sabendo como tudo começou, poucos a veriam como é hoje |url=http://portaltribuna.com/portal/ |access-date=2010-04-01 |website=Revista Tribuna |publisher=Grupo Tribuna de Paulínia |publication-place=Paulínia}}</ref>

=== Economic Growth ===
[[File:Lula e operários.jpg|thumb|President [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] with workers at the inauguration of REPLAN's Propene Unit, in 2009.]]
The first industrial unit to be installed where Paulínia is today was Rhodia, in 1942. For years it was the main industry in the city, initially focused on agro-industrial production and later transformed into a chemical industry.<ref name=":3" /> In 1968, General [[Arthur Duarte Candal Fonseca]], president of [[Petrobras]], announced the construction of an [[oil refinery]] in Paulínia. Construction began on February 28, 1969, on the five-year anniversary of emancipation, and the refinery was inaugurated on May 12, 1972. The president of Brazil, General [[Emílio Garrastazu Médici]], the president of Petrobras, [[Ernesto Geisel]], and the head of the military cabinet of the presidency, General [[João Figueiredo|João Batista de Oliveira Figueiredo]] were present at the ceremony.<ref name=":0" />

Replan has attracted thousands of immigrants to Paulínia, as well as other companies, which have transformed the town into the largest petrochemical complex in Latin America.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Nossa São Paulo |title=Dados e informações sobre Paulínia |url=http://www.nossosaopaulo.com.br/Reg_10/Reg10_Paulinia.htm# |access-date=2011-08-14}}</ref><ref name=":17">{{Cite web |last=Conheça Paulínia |title=Leis de incentivo fiscal para diversificar a economia de Paulínia |url=http://www.conhecapaulinia.com.br/noticias/60-lazer-e-entretenimento/213-prefeitura-de-paulinia-sanciona-leis-de-incentivo-fiscal-de-quase-r-4-milhoes |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121231191255/http://www.conhecapaulinia.com.br/noticias/60-lazer-e-entretenimento/213-prefeitura-de-paulinia-sanciona-leis-de-incentivo-fiscal-de-quase-r-4-milhoes |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-12-31 |access-date=2011-08-14}}</ref> Industries in Paulínia are concentrated in two distinct points: the REPLAN region and the [[Betel (district of Paulínia)|district of Betel]], which are consequently the richest and most polluted areas in Paulínia.<ref name=":0" />

In late 2010, [[LG Corporation|LG]] announced that it would build an industrial plant in the city of Paulínia, on land donated by the city government, which would produce white goods such as refrigerators, stoves, microwave ovens, among others. Construction was scheduled to begin in March 2011, with completion in October of the same year. The factory would employ 4.000 employees, surpassing Petrobras and becoming Paulínia's largest employer.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Scheller, Fernando |title=Coreana LG vai investir em fábrica de fogões e geladeiras em Paulínia |url=http://economia.estadao.com.br/noticias/negocios+industria,coreana-lg-vai-investir-em-fabrica-de-fogoes-e-geladeiras-em-paulinia,48114,0.htm |access-date=2012-01-28 |website=estadao.com.br |publication-date=2010-12-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=LG/Paulínia, no Brasil 500, começa a ser construída em três meses |url=http://www.correiopaulinense.com/voceleu.php?id=9 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729144922/http://www.correiopaulinense.com/voceleu.php?id=9 |archive-date=2012-07-29 |website=correiopaulinense.com.br |publication-date=2011-03-19}}</ref> However, by October, the construction work had not begun, causing the councilors to question the city hall.<ref>{{Cite web |title=O mistério da LG continua |url=http://alertapaulinia.com.br/2011/11/24/doacao-de-terras-o-misterio-da-lg-continua/ |access-date=2012-01-28 |website=alertapaulinia.com.br |publication-date=2011-11-24}}</ref> The initial project foresaw a three-story building, more suitable to the irregularity of the terrain. However, LG's headquarters requested a change to a single floor, which would have required the company to spend R$30 million on [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthmoving]]. LG then asked the city to exchange the donated land, which was refused because there was no other land with the same measurements. After this refusal, the company asked the city to pay for the earthmoving, which was also rejected, because Mayor José Pavan Júnior considered that the administration had already spent too much on the project (the donated land was valued at at least R$100 million). Since then the contacts between the company and the city hall have decreased. The donated area will return to the city hall if construction does not begin by the end of 2015.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gazzoni, Marina |title=LG ganha terreno, mas fábrica não sai do papel |url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/impresso,lg-ganha-terreno-mas-fabrica-nao-sai-do-papel--,812472,0.htm |access-date=2012-01-28 |website=estadao.com.br |publication-date=2011-12-18}}</ref>

=== Recent History ===
[[File:Bairro-betel.JPG|left|thumb|Central Betel region, annexed in 1993.]]
Paulínia's recent history is marked by great economic development, urban and population growth. Since the 1980s, when the municipal hospital was inaugurated, many works have been carried out to increase the capacity of some services. In 1981, the mayor of Paulínia at the time, Geraldo José Ballone, sent a law bill to the city council that created the municipal hospital. At the time the city had about 20,753 inhabitants, but the population did not have a public health facility in town that could provide examinations and consultations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Câmara municipal de Paulínia |title=Projeto de lei n° 05/81 |url=http://www.camarapaulinia.sp.gov.br/camver/PLLEGI/1981/00005.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/60wabxlbe?url=http://www.camarapaulinia.sp.gov.br/camver/PLLEGI/1981/00005.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-08-15 |access-date=2009-02-18}}</ref>

In the 1990s, great works were carried out in Paulínia, among them the construction of a virtual library, where citizens have free access to the internet, Paulínia's sambodrome, which is the largest indoor sambodrome in the country, and the improvement of the city's road systems.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Site do Jean Tosetto |title=Breve história de Paulínia |url=http://www.jeantosetto.com/2007/06/breve-historia-de-paulinia.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130103101141/http://www.jeantosetto.com/2007/06/breve-historia-de-paulinia.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2013-01-03 |access-date=2009-02-18}}</ref>

The intense urban growth of Paulínia and neighboring cities provoked the [[conurbation]] effect. This phenomenon is stronger on the border of Paulínia with [[Sumaré]], between the districts of Bom Retiro (Paulínia) and Maria Antônia (Sumaré), and on the border with [[Campinas]], between the districts of Betel and [[Barão Geraldo]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Anatel |title=Áreas conurbadas |url=http://www.anatel.gov.br/Portal/verificaDocumentos/documento.asp?numeroPublicacao=10394&assuntoPublicacao=Rela%E7%E3o%20de%20areas%20conurbadas%20no%20Brasil&caminhoRel=null&filtro=1&documentoPath=biblioteca/releases/1999/areas_conurbadas.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/60wakCRRM?url=http://www.anatel.gov.br/Portal/verificaDocumentos/documento.asp?numeroPublicacao=10394&assuntoPublicacao=Rela%E7%E3o%20de%20areas%20conurbadas%20no%20Brasil&caminhoRel=null&filtro=1&documentoPath=biblioteca/releases/1999/areas_conurbadas.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-08-15 |access-date=2011-08-14}}</ref><ref name=":4">{{Cite web |last=Unicamp |title=MAPEAMENTO E ANÁLISE DO USO ATUAL DA TERRA NA CIDADE DE PAULÍNIA (SP) |url=http://www.prp.unicamp.br/pibic/congressos/xvicongresso/paineis/060760.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190616154825/https://www.prp.unicamp.br/pibic/congressos/xvicongresso/paineis/060760.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=2019-06-16 |access-date=2011-08-14}}</ref> Paulínia has relevant territorial growth.

== Geography ==
[[File:Bjttexpaulinia1.JPG|thumb|Panoramic view of Paulínia.]]
Paulínia's geography is homogeneous. The municipality has a flat relief and [[Atlantic Forest|Atlantic]] vegetation. The area of the municipality is 141.72&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, representing 0.0509% of the [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]] territory, 0.0353% of the area of the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast region of Brazil]], and 0.0017% of the whole Brazilian territory.<ref name=":28">{{Cite web |last=Prefeitura de Paulínia |title=Dados geraios de Paulínia |url=http://www.paulinia.sp.gov.br/informacoes.aspx |access-date=2020-02-21}}</ref> It is located in the central-eastern region of the state of São Paulo, between the [[Atibaia River|Atibaia]] and [[Jaguari River (Paraíba do Sul)|Jaguari]] rivers and the Quilombo and Anhumas creeks, 118 kilometers from São Paulo by asphalt road, and 98 kilometers as the crow flies. Located in the Peripheral Paulista Depression, in São Paulo, the city borders Cosmópolis (to the north), Campinas (to the southeast), Sumaré (to the south), [[Nova Odessa]] (to the southwest), [[Jaguariúna]] (to the east), [[Holambra]] (to the northeast) and Americana (to the west). The urban perimeter of Paulínia is 137.61&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Urbanização das cidades brasileiras |url=http://www.urbanizacao.cnpm.embrapa.br/conteudo/base.html |access-date=2008-09-23 |publisher=Embrapa Monitoramento por Satélite}}</ref> which is equivalent to 99% of the total area.<ref name=":4" />

Paulínia is located in the central area of the Metropolitan Region of Campinas, not bordering municipalities outside the region. Paulínia is geographically divided into two main regions, the north, where REPLAN and the district of São José are located, and the south, where Paulínia Shopping and the [[Paulínia Municipal Theater]] are, where the I [[Paulínia Film Festival]] was held; these two regions are divided by the Atibaia river. Paulínia's position was a problem for the old farms located in this area, which saw the rivers as "natural barriers to development" in the region.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |title=Prefeitura municipal |url=http://www.paulinia.sp.gov.br/ |access-date=2009-03-24}}</ref>

=== Relief and geology ===
[[File:Av 1 Marieta.jpg|left|thumb|View of the Marieta Dian neighborhood, one of the city's high points.]]
Paulínia is located in the so-called Peripheral Paulista Depression, a formation between the western and Atlantic plateaus (''[[Serra do Mar]]'' and ''[[Mantiqueira Mountains|Serra da Mantiqueira]]''). The territory is homogeneous, with great relief variations only in the neighborhoods of Alto de Pinheiros, Vila Nunes, Marieta Dian, Santa Cecília and Tereza Zorzetto Vedovello. The highest neighborhoods in Paulínia are located in the northern and eastern regions of the city, such as Marieta Dian, São José and Parque das Indústrias.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Relevo de Paulínia |url=http://paulinia.net/relevo |access-date=2009-09-26 |website=Paulinia.net}}</ref>

Paulínia's soil is also homogeneous, being of good quality in most of the city. It is characteristic for having a lot of [[humus]], which facilitates the development of crops.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cetesb |title=Capacidade de suporte ambiental da região de Paulínia |url=http://www.ambiente.sp.gov.br/destaque/2004/marco/17_paulinia.htm |access-date=2009-02-05}}</ref>

The lowest altitudes of the Paulista Peripheral Depression are located in the region of the Atibaia and Jaguari rivers, between 560 and 600 meters above [[sea level]].<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |last=Fernandes, Amélia João; Cláudio Limeira Mello |year=2004 |title=COBERTURAS CENOZÓICAS E ESTRUTURAS DEFORMADORAS NA DEPRESSÃO PERIFÉRICA PAULISTA, CAMPINAS, SÃO PAULO |url=http://www.igeologico.sp.gov.br/downloads/revista_ig/25_1-2_3.pdf |access-date=2010-02-21 |website=IG |publisher=Revista do Instituto Geológico}}</ref> In this region the morphology is characterized by broad hills with flattened tops. This zone also has its greatest thicknesses, with the presence of fluvial facies typical of floodplains. Near Paulínia, they reach a thickness of about 10 meters. The [[diabase]] rocks are abundant between Paulínia and Campinas, and are fine to medium grained.<ref name=":6" />

=== Hydrography ===
[[File:Atibaia River.jpg|thumb|Stretch of the Atibaia River in Paulínia.]]
Two rivers pass through the city of Paulínia: the Jaguari river, which is located on the border of Paulínia and Cosmópolis, and the Atibaia river, which divides the city into two parts and passes near the center. Its origin is in [[Bom Jesus dos Perdões]], the result of the junction of the Atibainha and [[Cachoeira River (São Paulo)|Cachoeira]] rivers. In the municipality of Americana the river is dammed and the Salto Grande reservoir, as it is known, extends to the São Paulo neighborhoods of Parque da Represa and Balneário Tropical. The Jaguari river originates in [[Minas Gerais]] and receives important tributaries, such as the [[Camanducaia River|Camanducaia]] River. In the São Paulo territory the river is dammed as part of the cantareira system and in Americana it joins with the Atibaia river and forms the [[Piracicaba River|Piracicaba river]].<ref name=":7">Revista PDH. ''Programa Despoluição Hídrica''. Edição única. Instituto Ecoplann, Secretaria da educação de Paulínia.</ref>

Besides these rivers, several streams and creeks are present in Paulínia, especially the Quilombo creek, on the border with [[Sumaré]], and the [[Anhumas creek]], on the border with Campinas and [[Jaguariúna]]. Among the streams are Jacaré and Jacarezinho, which are tributaries of Jaguari, Areião, Veadinho, and São Bento, tributaries of the Atibaia River, and the streams Betel, Fazenda do Deserto and Velosa (the latter on the border with Sumaré), tributaries of Quilombo Creek. The municipality also has several lakes and lagoons, the main ones being Santa Terezinha, Armando Ferreira, Jardim Botânico, José Maria Malavazzi and César Bierrembach.<ref name=":7" />

=== Climate ===
The city of Paulínia belongs to the climate zone designated by the letter C, with climate type Cwa, according to the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen-Geiger climate classification]], and the climate is considered [[Subhumid temperate climate|subhumid temperate]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Dados gerais de Paulínia |url=http://www.brasilchannel.com.br/municipios/mostrar_municipio.asp?nome=Paul%EDnia&uf=SP |access-date=2010-03-30}}</ref> with rains concentrated in the summer months, with a decrease in its frequency in the winter, when the [[Humidity|relative humidity]] of the air drops, especially during the afternoon, with rates below 30% or even close to 20%.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Defesa Civil alerta que índice ficará entre 23% e 19% até esta quarta-feira |url=https://paulinia24horasnoticia.com/2018/08/13/baixa-umidade-do-ar-coloca-paulinia-em-estado-de-atencao/ |access-date=2021-06-13}}</ref> Due to the low concentration of buildings, [[Urban heat island|heat islands]] rarely occur, so the thermometers remain below the 40&nbsp;°C mark in most of the city, even in the hottest months of the year.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Congreso Internacional del Americanistas |title=49° Congreso Internacional del Americanistas (ICA) |url=http://www.antropologia.com.ar/congresos/contenido/49CAI/Pinto_Silva.htm |access-date=2009-02-05}}</ref>

According to data from the Integrated Center for Agrometeorological Information (CIIAGRO/SP), referring to the period from December 1993 to January 2011 and from February 2016, the absolute minimum temperature recorded in Paulinia was 0&nbsp;°C in June 1994, on June 26 and 27, and the highest reached 40.6&nbsp;°C on October 8, 2020. The highest rainfall accumulations recorded in 24 hours, equal to or greater than 100&nbsp;mm, were 119.4&nbsp;mm on December 1, 2003, 118.6&nbsp;mm on November 17, 2003, and 103.4&nbsp;mm on December 22, 2020.

=== Biodiversity and green areas ===
[[File:Parque Zeca Malavazzi.jpg|thumb|Zeca Malavazzi Park, a place with preserved vegetation.]]
Paulínia's fauna presents species typical of the [[Atlantic Forest]] and [[Cerrado]], but in some places species from other domains can be found. In the minipantanal, which is an area of transition between [[biome]]s, species such as the [[spot-flanked gallinule]], [[black skimmer]], [[heron]]s, and [[nutria]]s can be found.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mini Pantanal - Terminal Turístico Luiz Pelatti - Pier |url=http://www.conhecapaulinia.com.br/a-cidade/pontos-turisticos/636-mini-pantanal-terminal-turistico-luiz-pelatti-pier |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110626213228/http://www.conhecapaulinia.com.br/a-cidade/pontos-turisticos/636-mini-pantanal-terminal-turistico-luiz-pelatti-pier |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-06-26 |access-date=2011-06-02 |website=conhecapaulinia.com.br}}</ref> [[Capybara]]s are found almost everywhere along the Atibaia River, and are common in the Campinas region.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cosmos: história de uma onça urbana |url=http://www.oeco.com.br/petercrawshaw |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031130839/http://www.oeco.com.br/petercrawshaw |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-10-31 |access-date=2011-06-02 |website=oeco.com.br}}</ref>

Paulínia is a municipality where a large part of the original landscape, originally covered by the Atlantic Forest, has been modified due to human action.<ref>{{Cite web |last=CETESB |title=Relatório sobre capacidade de suporte ambiental da região de Paulínia |url=http://www.ambiente.sp.gov.br/destaque/2004/marco/17_paulinia.htm |access-date=2009-01-29}}</ref> Currently the few original green areas are protected so that they do not disappear.<ref>{{Cite web |title=APA da Bacia do Camanducaia |url=http://www.reocities.com/CapitolHill/1830/apa.htm |access-date=2010-02-21}}</ref> In order to do this, the city government has created the areas of environmental preservation under reclamation, to recover degraded areas. The main areas where the vegetation is intact or little altered are located in the neighborhoods of Cascata, [[Recanto dos Pássaros]], [[Parque Brasil 500]], [[Betel (district of Paulínia)|Betel]], Planalto and Monte Alegre. Other preserved areas are in rural or uninhabited areas, such as Jardim Harmonia, isolated regions of Betel, bordering areas and areas in the north of Paulínia.<ref name=":5" />

Several environmental areas in Paulínia are important tourist attractions, such as the minipantanal and the botanical garden, which is one of the most respected in the state and in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jornal RMC |title=Jardim Botânico de Paulínia completa 15 anos e se projeta como instituição respeitável |url=http://www.jornalrmc.com.br/rmc_noticia.php?id_noticia=37 |access-date=2009-01-29}}</ref>

=== Environmental Problems ===
[[File:Inundação no sao jose.jpg|left|thumb|Flooding at Dorcelino R da Cunha Street, in the São José neighborhood.]]
Paulínia is environmentally stressed, which means that it has a vegetation cover of less than 5% of the municipal area, consequently presenting higher risks of [[flood]]ing,[[aggradation]] of water courses, [[erosion]], and disappearance of fauna and flora.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Paulínia está entre as 14 cidades da RMC que apresenta estresse ambiental |url=http://www.rmcnoticias.com.br/index.php?pg=noticia&id=10292 |access-date=2021-01-27 |website=rmcnoticias.com.br |publication-date=2009-04-15}}</ref> In heavy rainfall events, several streets and avenues in Paulínia suffer from flooding. Among the regions where this problem is constant, the low-lying areas near the César Bierrembach lagoon in the neighborhoods São José<ref>{{Cite web |last=TVB |title=Chuva forte em Paulínia invade casa de moradores |url=http://www.tvb.com.br/sprecord/videos-exibe.asp?v=10612 |access-date=2010-12-04 |publication-date=2010-11-30}}</ref> and João Aranha,<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Moradores protestam contra alagamentos no João Aranha |url=http://acontecepaulinia.multiply.com/photos/album/1463 |journal=Acontece Paulínia |volume=1 |issue=6}}</ref> on José Paulino Avenue,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jornal Todo Dia - Americana |title=Inundações na avenida José Paulino |url=http://www2.uol.com.br/tododia/ano2004/fevereiro/150204/cidades.htm |access-date=2009-02-27}}</ref> in the Recanto dos Pássaros<ref name=":8">{{Cite web |last=Jornal Todo Dia - Americana |title=Recanto dos Pássaros é atingido por enchentes |url=http://www2.uol.com.br/tododia/ano2003/fevereiro/190203/cidades.htm |access-date=2009-02-27}}</ref> and Jardim Europa neighborhoods stand out. The problems occur mainly due to the lack of culverts and galleries for draining excess water, except in the case of Recanto dos Pássaros, which is affected by the flooding of the Atibaia river.<ref name=":8" />

The city's air pollution by ozone is intense, mainly due to the large amount of polluting industries, such as REPLAN, but contrary to what is commonly said, the city has normal levels of other pollutants, such as the hourly average concentration of [[nitrogen dioxide]] (NO<sub>2</sub>), which was 87.8 ppb (particles per billion) in 2002, while the acceptable level is 170 ppb.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Unicamp |title=Ozônio, o vilão de Paulínia |url=http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/unicamp_hoje/jornalPDF/193-pag08.pdf |access-date=2009-12-29}}</ref>

The city also suffers from [[water pollution]] that affects some of the city's streams. The city's rivers, mainly the Atibaia river, are also affected by contamination with chemicals highly harmful to health, as in 1995, when it became public the contamination of the Atibaia river and the water table near the area by Shell, which due to flooding and the fact that many residents use wells, contaminated the population of the Recanto dos Pássaros neighborhood, who were forced to leave the place.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Shell readquire área contaminada em Paulínia |url=http://www.cadepaulinia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1077&catid=58:paulinia&Itemid=474 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240525170256/https://www.webcitation.org/650qBNyfk?url=http://www.cadepaulinia.com/index.php%3Foption=com_content&view=article&id=1077&catid=58:paulinia&Itemid=474 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2024-05-25 |access-date=2012-01-27 |website=cadepaulinia.com.br}}</ref> Currently there is still a problem with the contamination caused by Shell, and efforts are being made to prevent a bigger problem from occurring.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Premio Reportaje |title=Estudo aponta novo risco de contaminação em Paulínia |url=http://www.premioreportaje.org/article.sub?docId=7818&c=Brasil&cRef=Brazil&year=2004&date=marzo%202004 |access-date=2009-06-12}}</ref>

Some streams in Paulínia, such as the Jacaré stream, are at risk of disappearing due to environmental damage in their sources. The Jacaré stream has its [[Spring (hydrology)|spring]] at the central border of José Bordignon Avenue, near a scrap metal warehouse, and its first stretches are full of garbage, which can gradually compromise the César Bierrembach lagoon, which depends largely on this stream. The Morro Alto stream, located in the neighborhood of the same name and a tributary of the Atibaia river, disappeared due to the subdivision of its source area, where the Parque das Árvores neighborhood was created.<ref name=":7" />

== Demography ==

Agriculture is of little importance in Paulínia. The main crops are [[Sugarcane|sugar cane]], corn and orange. The north-northwest regions used to stand out for the large orange production, but this culture has been losing space to the subdivision of land in the region, with the creation of neighborhoods such as São José and Marieta Dian. Sugar cane is still a highlight in the southern region, with large producing areas. In total, Paulínia has 380 farms, but most of them are small-sized.<ref name=":34">{{Cite web |last=IBGE Cidades |title=Produções agrícolas paulinenses |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/topwindow.htm?1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430164910/http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/topwindow.htm?1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-04-30 |access-date=2009-02-25}}</ref>

=== Secondary Sector ===
[[File:Propeno.JPG|left|thumb|View of the propylene production unit towers, in REPLAN.]]
The secondary sector is currently the main source generating Paulínia's Gross Domestic Product. Represented mainly by the chemical and petrochemical industries, Paulínia's secondary sector is known for the large number of industries, especially multinationals, such as the American [[ExxonMobil]] and the New Zealand-British Shell. Paulínia's industrial development began with the installation of Rhodia on São Francisco farm, in 1942, when Paulínia still belonged to Campinas,<ref name=":2" /> but the main event occurred after emancipation, with the inauguration of REPLAN in 1972,<ref name=":0" /> which transformed the town into a large producer of refined petroleum. The industrial pole in Paulínia, formed by companies such as Petrobras, owner of Replan, Fic, [[Ipiranga (company)|Ipiranga]], Eucatex and Rhodia makes the city the largest petrochemical pole in Latin America. Other companies stand out, such as Nutriara, from the food industry, [[Cargill]] and [[Nestlé Purina PetCare|Purina]], from the animal feed industry, AsGa, from the telecommunications industry, among others.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Empresa - Sobre a AsGa |url=http://www.asga.com.br/empresa.html |access-date=2010-10-02 |website=asga.com.br}}</ref><ref name=":23">{{Cite web |last=Seade |title=Pib dos municípios paulistas em 2008 |url=http://www.seade.gov.br/produtos/pibmun/tab_2008.htm}}</ref>

Paulínia's industry is the third largest GDP generator in the [[Campinas metropolitan area|Metropolitan Region of Campinas]], smaller only than the neighboring metropolis, Campinas, and the city of Sumaré.<ref name=":19" /> The industrial sector accounts for almost 50% of Paulínia's GDP.<ref name=":23" /> Oil derivatives represent the most produced products in Paulínia, followed by other chemical products and food.

==== Petrochemical Pole ====
The largest chemical and petrochemical industrial complex in Brazil is located in the northern region of the municipality.<ref name=":18" /> Centered in the Planalto Paulista Refinery, there are also companies such as Rhodia, the first in the city, Shell, Ipiranga, ExxonMobil and [[Braskem]]. The center is responsible for a good part of the jobs and of the Gross Domestic Product of Paulínia, being one of the main reasons for attracting immigrants to the city.<ref name=":16" />

=== Tertiary sector ===
[[File:Theatro municipal paulinia.JPG|thumb|Municipal Theater of Paulínia.]]
Nationally, Paulínia's commerce is not outstanding. In the tertiary sector, the town is known for having a large cinema pole, built through the ''[[Paulínia Magia do Cinema]]'' project, and which has been the location for several films, such as ''[[O Menino da Porteira (2009)|O Menino da Porteira]]''.<ref name=":20" /> Tourism is also important in the town.

[[José Paulino Avenue]], in the center of Paulínia, has important commercial establishments, most of them being branches of large national chains. Other important commercial centers in Paulínia are the districts of Santa Cecília and Nova Paulínia, where Santa Cruz Street is located, headquarters of numerous medical clinics and other stores.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cidade de Paulínia |url=http://pauliniablog.blogspot.com/ |access-date=2009-03-24}}</ref> The sector that most employs in Paulínia is the tertiary one, which at the beginning of 2001 employed 978 people.<ref name=":23" />

In 2006 the city administration created the project ''Paulínia Magia do Cinema'', with the goals of increasing tourism and boosting the economy. Through this project, the [[Festival Paulínia de Cinema|Paulínia Film Festival]], Paulínia Cinematographic Pole, ''Magia do Cinema'' School and the Paulínia Film Commission were idealized. Several films have already been shot at the pole, such as ''O Menino da Porteira'' and ''[[Topografia de um Desnudo]]''. The cinema pole is the result of one of the largest investments in audiovisual production in Brazil. Around 550 million ''reais'' from the administration and companies have already been spent on the project. ''Paulínia Magia do Cinema'' project has been highlighted in the national press due to the size of the investments.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Críticos se rendem ao Paulínia Magia do Cinema |url=http://www.cineclubes.org.br/tiki/tiki-read_article.php?articleId=39 |access-date=2009-01-22 |website=Cineclubes.org}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cinemagia |title=Paulínia: investimento público em cinema como propulsor cultural, econômico e social |url=http://www.usp.br/celacc/ojs/index.php/blacc/article/view/155/188 |access-date=2009-01-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Cinemagia |title=Paulínia inicia o Projeto Paulínia Magia do Cinema |url=http://www.cineclubes.org.br/tiki/tiki-view_articles.php?find=&topic=&type=&offset=390&sort_mode=publishDate_desc |access-date=2009-02-21}}</ref>

==== Tourism ====
[[File:Zeca Malavazzi.jpg|left|thumb|Parque José Maria Malavazzi, or Zeca Malavazzi, an important tourist attraction in Paulínia.]]
Paulínia has many tourist attractions. Among the most visited natural tourist spots are the minipantanal, the ecological park, and the Adelelmo Piva Júnior Botanical Garden, which still keeps animal and vegetal species preserved in their natural habitat. The virtual library, where the population has free access to the internet, and the [[Municipal Theater of Paulínia|Municipal Theater]], part of Paulínia's cinematographic pole, are other important tourist attractions.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Conheça Paulínia |title=Turismo em Paulínia |url=http://www.conhecapaulinia.com.br/a-cidade/pontos-turisticos |access-date=2010-02-21}}</ref>

The main ones are the Medieval Portal, the Colonial, the Futuristic and the Parque Brasil 500.<ref name=":25">{{Cite web |last=Prefeitura de Paulínia |title=Praça Paul Percy Harris |url=http://www.paulinia.sp.gov.br/mostraservico.aspx?id=57}}</ref> Paulínia's squares and traffic circles are also visited a lot thanks to the decoration made with several colorful plants, which form drawings of several shapes.<ref name=":26">{{Cite web |title=Turismo em Paulínia |url=http://paulinia.net/turismo |access-date=2012-01-28 |website=paulinia.net}}</ref> The Paul Percy Harris square is known for having the largest [[Rotary International|Rotarian]] symbol in the world.<ref name=":25" />

Other tourist attractions in Paulínia are the Cidade Feliz fountain, which supplies mineral water to the population, the bicycle cross track, where several competitions are held, such as [[Bicicross Américas]], Zeca Malavazzi park, Brasil 500 park, the historical museum, Saint Benedict church, and the Sagrado Coração de Jesus square.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Turismo em Paulínia |url=http://www.ferias.tur.br/informacoes/9464/paulinia-sp.html |access-date=2009-02-25 |website=Ferias.tur.br}}</ref>

[[Paulínia's carnival]] is considered the largest in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas and is much appreciated by tourists, especially from towns in the area.

Paulínia's events and tourist sites attract many tourists every year. Events such as ''[[Folia de Reis]]'', ''Paulitália'', which is a party in honor of the Italian immigrants in Paulínia, and the Christmas of Lights stand out.<ref name=":26" />

== Urban Structure ==
[[File:Avenida-jose-paulino.jpg|thumb|José Paulino Avenue, in downtown Paulínia.Image: Júlio Boaro]]
Paulínia has a great urban infrastructure. The city's water and sewage service is provided by [[Sabesp]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=SABESP-Saneamento básico de estado de São Paulo |title=Encontro Sabesp-Prefeitura de Paulínia |url=http://www.comitepcj.sp.gov.br/download/CT-SA_Ata_28_Ord_02-07-08_01.pdf |access-date=2009-01-29}}</ref> The water consumed by the inhabitants of Paulínia comes from the Jaguari river,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cosmo On-line |title=Barragem no rio Jaguari garante água a três cidades |url=http://www.rac.com.br/noticias/campinas-e-rmc/8377/2008/09/20/barragem-no-rio-jaguari-garante-agua-a-3-cidades.html |access-date=2010-03-11}}</ref> on the border with Cosmópolis, which undergoes treatment in the city's water treatment station. The city also has two important mineral [[Spring (hydrology)|water springs]], one in the Cascata neighborhood and the other on the access to downtown.<ref name=":25" />

The electric power is supplied by the company [[CPFL Energia|CPFL]],<ref>{{Cite web |last=CPFL |title=CPFL no Interior paulista |url=http://www.aleph.com.br/sciarts/cpfl/CPFL%20-%20Conheca.htm |access-date=2009-02-25}}</ref> which has several distribution centers in neighborhoods such as Cascata, Bela Vista and Santa Terezinha, as well as a substation near the São Francisco farm. In addition, there are several transmission towers, installed on the central beds and sidewalks of some avenues, such as Avenida José Padovani and Nelson Prosdócimo.<ref name=":27" />

In the municipality there are two cemeteries, which are the Municipal Cemetery, in the center, and the Palm Tree Cemetery, in the Santa Terezinha neighborhood, as well as two post office distribution centers.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Apontador |title=Serviços gerais de Paulínia |url=http://www.apontador.com.br/em/sp_paulinia/servicos-gerais |access-date=2009-01-25}}</ref>

=== Security ===
As in most Brazilian medium and large cities, criminality is a serious problem in Paulínia. In 2006 the homicide rate in the municipality was 8.6, a fall of 39% compared to the 2002 rate, which was 22.1.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Ritla |year=2008 |title=Base de dados dos municípios |url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Security/citizensecurity/brazil/documents/mapaviolencia.pdf |access-date=2012-02-16 |publisher=Mapa da Violência dos Municípios Brasileiros-2008}}</ref> In absolute numbers, the average of homicides in the decade of 2000 was 10.33 homicides per year.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Secretaria de Segurança Pública |title=Estatísticas |url=http://www.ssp.sp.gov.br/estatistica/dados.aspx?id=413 |access-date=2010-07-28}}</ref> The rate of firearm-related deaths, after increasing between 2002 and 2004, started to decrease in 2005, and was 7.2 in 2006.

Drug trafficking is also present, and a recent concern is crack. With the pulverization of [[cracolândia]], in São Paulo, many users went to cities in the interior, such as Paulínia. Currently places like Morro Alto and Marieta Dian neighborhoods, as well as São Bento Street, have points of sale and consumption of the drug.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Epidemia do crack chega a Paulínia |url=http://www.portaldepaulinia.com.br/home/noticias-de-paulinia/cidade/14763-epidemia-do-crack-chega-a-paulinia.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120907104237/http://www.portaldepaulinia.com.br/home/noticias-de-paulinia/cidade/14763-epidemia-do-crack-chega-a-paulinia.html |archive-date=2012-09-07 |access-date=2012-03-19 |website=portaldepaulinia.com.br}}</ref> Another very common crime is [[theft]] (robbery without violence). In the first half of 2012, Paulínia was the municipality in the Metropolitan Region of Campinas with the most cases, in relation to the population. There were 90 cases per 10,000 inhabitants.<ref>{{Cite web |title=RMC registra 93 furtos por dia, aponta Secretaria de Segurança |url=http://globotv.globo.com/eptv-sp/jornal-regional-campinaspiracicaba/t/veja-tambem/v/rmc-registra-93-furtos-por-dia-aponta-secretaria-de-seguranca/2065885/ |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69YV1B57t?url=http://globotv.globo.com/eptv-sp/jornal-regional-campinaspiracicaba/t/veja-tambem/v/rmc-registra-93-furtos-por-dia-aponta-secretaria-de-seguranca/2065885/ |archive-date=2012-07-31 |access-date=2012-07-31 |website=eptv.com}}</ref>

Paulínia has a police station located in the Santa Cecília neighborhood, which currently has Sandro Montanari as its delegate.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Homem é morto com 4 tiros em assalto em Paulínia |url=http://noticia23.com.br/?p=12355 |website=noticia23.com.br}}</ref> There are also two community police stations in the city, one in João Aranha and the other in Betel. The city's portals have one guard post each, in order to patrol the entrances and exits of the city, but have been criticized for not having municipal guards on many occasions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=População reclama da falta de guardas municipais nos portais de Paulínia |url=http://alertapaulinia.com.br/2011/07/18/populacao-reclama-da-falta-de-guardas-municipais-nos-portais-de-paulinia/ |access-date=2012-01-28 |website=alertapaulinia.com.br}}</ref>

=== Education ===
Paulínia has schools in all regions of the municipality. Due to intense urbanization, rural residents have easy access to schools in nearby urban districts. Education in municipal schools has a higher level than in state schools, but the city government is creating studies to make state public education better, in order to achieve better results in IDEB.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Governo Federal |title=IDEB - Índice de Desenvolvimento da Educação Básica |url=http://ideb.inep.gov.br/ |publication-date=2009-01-20}}</ref>

Paulínia has 25 elementary, middle and high schools, besides 12 pre-schools. The technical schools ETEP and [[CEMEP]] stand out in Paulínia. The latter is considered the best school in Paulínia and offers computer, hardware, programming and high school courses.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Semanário Oficial |title=Escola Técnica de Paulínia fica em 1º lugar no ranking das escolas técnicas municipais do Brasil no ENEM 2009 |url=http://paulinia.net/semanario-oficial-859 |access-date=2010-10-04}}</ref>

In 2007 there were 12,037 elementary school enrollments, 3188 secondary school enrollments, 1380 higher education enrollments, and 3292 pre-school enrollments.

Paulínia has a higher education institution, the Paulínia College, which is private. The city also has a [[State University of Campinas|Unicamp]] research center, the Pluridisciplinary Center for Chemical, Biological and Agricultural Research (CPQBA), located in the district of Betel.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Unicamp |title=Como chegar ao CPQBA |url=http://www.cpqba.unicamp.br/organizacao/mapa_cursos.htm |access-date=2009-04-15}}</ref>

=== Health ===
[[File:Hospital-municipal.JPG|thumb|External view of the Paulínia's Municipal Hospital Vereador Antônio Orlando Navarro, after undergoing renovation.]]
Paulínia has 20 health establishments, 14 of which are public, including hospitals, emergency rooms, health posts, and dental services. The city has 106 beds for hospitalization in healthcare facilities, of which 83 are public and 23 private. There is also the CETREIM (Municipal Integrated Therapy and Rehabilitation Center) and the Preventive Health Center, being classified by [[SEADE]] as the 6th best in the Government region.<ref>{{Cite web |last=IBGE |title=Censo das cidades brasileiras |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/topwindow.htm?1 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120430164910/http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/topwindow.htm?1 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-04-30 |access-date=2009-01-21}}</ref>

Until the beginning of the year 2000 Paulínia had few public health units, the only ones existing being the municipal hospital, a small health center in the João Aranha district and another in Nova Paulínia. From that year on new units started to be built due to the city's growth, since the original ones were not supporting the amount of services.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Novas realizações marcam administração visionária |url=http://portaltribuna.com/portal/ |journal=Revista Tribuna |location=Paulínia |publication-date=2007-02-01 |volume=19 |access-date=2009-09-27}}</ref>

Paulínia's municipal hospital was built in the early 1980s and underwent its first major structural renovation in 2008, when the hospital's area was expanded, which made it possible to increase capacity and, consequently, services. Soon afterwards, other stages of the renovation began, consisting of the construction of a [[helipad]] to facilitate the transport of patients in serious condition to larger hospitals, such as the [[Hospital das Clínicas da Unicamp|Clinics Hospital of the University of Campinas]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Paulínia News - Jornal de Paulínia |title=Reforma do hospital municipal |url=http://www.paulinianews.com.br/?pg=noticia&id=7646 |access-date=2009-02-03}}</ref>

=== Communications ===
Paulínia has many means of communication, especially newspapers. The most traditional are ''Jornal de Paulínia'', created in the 1960s by journalist Carlos Tontoli; ''Correio Paulinense'', created by Mizael Marcelly;<ref>{{Cite web |last=Correio Paulinense |title=Correio Paulinense agora na versão Online |url=http://www.correiopaulinense.com/}}</ref> ''O Cromo'';<ref>{{Cite web |last=Lista On |title=Jornais de Paulínia cadastrados na Lista On |url=http://www.listaon.com.br/paulinia/lista.php?menu=jornais}}</ref> ''Agora Paulínia'' by Alexandre Mane; and ''Tribuna de Paulínia''. Many newspapers from Paulínia also circulate in Cosmópolis and Artur Nogueira. The newspapers ''Notícia Já'', ''Correio Popular'', ''[[Folha de S.Paulo]]'', ''[[O Estado de S. Paulo]]'', ''[[Agora São Paulo|Agora]]'', ''Todo Dia'', among others, also circulate in the city. There are four radio stations in the city: ''Paulínia FM, Matriz FM, A Mais FM,'' and ''Rádio Canção Nova AM''.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rádios ao Vivo |title=Rádios da região de Campinas |url=http://www.radios.com.br/cgi-bin/search.cgi?query=regsp02&nh=3}}</ref>

In Paulínia there are dial-up and [[broadband]] ([[ADSL]] and radio) internet services being offered by several providers. In fixed-line telephony the city was initially served by [[Companhia Telefônica Brasileira]] (CTB) until 1973,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Relação do patrimônio da CTB incorporado pela Telesp |url=https://www.imprensaoficial.com.br/DO/BuscaDO2001Documento_11_4.aspx?link=/1973/ineditoriais/junho/20/pag_0009_2TIM6BGCRNUOSe8LEFA7U4SO2TJ.pdf&pagina=9&data=20/06/1973&caderno=Ineditoriais&paginaordenacao=100009 |website=Diário Oficial do Estado de São Paulo}}</ref> when it started to be served by [[Telesp|Telecomunicações de São Paulo]] (TELESP), which built the telephone exchanges used until today. In 1998 this company was privatized and sold to [[Telefônica Brasil|Telefónica]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nossa História |url=http://telefonica.mediagroup.com.br/pt/Empresa/Nossa_Historia.aspx |website=Telefônica / VIVO}}</ref> and in 2012 the company adopted the [[Vivo (technology company)|Vivo]] brand for its operations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=GASPARIN, Gabriela |title=Telefônica conclui troca da marca por Vivo |url=http://g1.globo.com/economia/negocios/noticia/2012/04/telefonica-conclui-troca-da-marca-por-vivo.html |website=G1 |publication-date=2012-04-12}}</ref> The operators Vivo, [[TIM Brasil|TIM]] and [[Claro (company)|Claro]] offer mobile phone service. Paulínia's area code is 19 and since the beginning of 2009, Paulínia is served by portability, as well as other 72 cities with an area code of 19 and a [[ZIP Code|ZIP code]] that goes from 13140–001 to 13149–999.<ref>{{Cite web |title=CEP de cidades brasileiras |url=http://www.buscacep.correios.com.br/servicos/dnec/menuAction.do?Metodo=menuFaixaCep |access-date=2012-01-06}}</ref> Portability is a service that makes it possible to change the operator without the need to change the phone number.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Paulínia News |title=Paulinenses já poderão trocar operadora de telefonia sem ter de mudar o número |url=http://www.paulinianews.com.br/?pg=noticia&id=9353 |access-date=2009-03-02}}</ref>

=== Transportation ===
Paulínia has a good highway-railroad network that connects it to several cities in the [[Interior of São Paulo|interior of the state]] and even to the capital. Paulínia is close to the [[Viracopos International Airport]] ([[International Air Transport Association|IATA]]: VCP - [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]]: SBKP), one of the largest in the country, and has access to highways of state and even national importance through paved side roads with double lane, such as the Prefeito José Lozano Araújo road. Currently, the vehicle fleet in Paulínia is 24,448 cars, 1468 trucks, 1065 tractor trucks, 1970 pickup trucks, 5710 motorcycles, 227 buses and only 9 agricultural tractors.<ref>{{Cite web |last=IBGE Cidades |title=Gráfico dos transportes em Paulínia |url=http://www.ibge.gov.br/cidadesat/xtras/grafico_cidades.php?codmun=353650&tema=frota}}</ref> The [[Rodovia Anhanguera|Anhanguera]], [[Rodovia dos Bandeirantes|Bandeirantes]] and [[Rodovia Dom Pedro I|Dom Pedro]] I highways do not pass through the area of the municipality of Paulínia, but are easily accessible through side roads, besides SP-332 which is state highway.<ref name=":28" />

The duplicated and paved avenues improve traffic in the city and some avenues on the outskirts relieve traffic in the city center. Traffic on the city's main avenue was being hampered by the growth in the number of vehicles in Paulínia, which forced the administration to improve the public road system to avoid overloading the city center.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Novas realizações marcam administração visionária |journal=Revista Tribuna |publication-place=Paulínia |publication-date=2007-02-28 |volume=19}}</ref> However, the fact that the northern region, separated from the other regions by the Atibaia river, is connected to these regions only by a bridge, between José Paulino Avenue and PLN 339, is already causing congestion in the latter and other tributary roads, such as São Bento and João Franco Cunha Streets. That is why projects to build another connection between the north and the other regions are already being analyzed.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fiorella quer anel viário João Aranha – Núcleos para acabar com congestionamentos no Centro |url=http://www.pauliniaemfoco.com.br/noticias/paulinianoticias/298-fiorella-quer-anel-viario-joao-aranha-nucleos-para-acabar-com-congestionamentos-no-centro-vereador-tambem-pede-medidas-para-melhorar-seguranca-nessas-vias-.html |access-date=2011-02-11 |website=Site oficial da Câmara de vereadores de Paulínia |publication-date=2010-10-27}}</ref>

==== Air Transportation ====
Paulínia doesn't have commercial airports in its territory. However, [[Viracopos International Airport|Viracopos Airport]] is located in the city of Campinas, 31&nbsp;km from Paulínia's downtown, in the same Metropolitan Region of Campinas, serving the whole region with daily flights to São Paulo and other destinations.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Em Sampa |title=SBKP: AEROPORTO INTERNACIONAL DE VIRACOPOS CAMPINAS - SÃO PAULO |url=http://www.emsampa.com.br/voos/aeroporto_campinas.htm |access-date=2010-07-20}}</ref> Besides Viracopos, the [[Campo dos Amarais Airport]] is located about 9&nbsp;km from the city, also in Campinas.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Em Sampa |title=Aeroportos de São Paulo |url=http://www.emsampa.com.br/warsp.htm |access-date=2010-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=IVAO |title=Campinas - Amarais |url=http://www.ivao.aero/db/ss/airport.asp?Id=SDAM |access-date=2010-07-20 |language=en}}</ref>

==== Public roads ====
In Paulínia there is a system of public roads which allows access to other cities and highways without having to go through the city center. Due to the problems that José Paulino Avenue, in the city center, was facing with the excess of vehicles, avenues were built in the periphery that connect the neighborhoods to other neighborhoods and highways, such as the avenues Oswaldo Piva, Roma, and Expedicionários. With the concession of the [[Rodovia Professor Zeferino Vaz|SP-332]] highway and the possible installation of a toll booth on it, there is the possibility of the center being used as an escape route, which would make the traffic problems return.<ref>{{Cite web |last=O Globo |title=Três praças de pedágio começam a funcionar na região de Campinas, em SP |date=17 November 2009 |url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/tres-pracas-de-pedagio-comecam-funcionar-na-regiao-de-campinas-em-sp-3153510 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120711154117/http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/tres-pracas-de-pedagio-comecam-funcionar-na-regiao-de-campinas-em-sp-3153510 |archive-date=2012-07-11 |access-date=2012-02-04}}</ref><ref name=":29">{{Cite web |last=CityBrazil |title=Mapa da cidade de Paulínia |url=http://www.citybrazil.com.br/sp/paulinia/mapas.php |access-date=2009-02-27}}</ref>

Paulínia's avenues are characterized by their large amount of trees, especially José Paulino and João Aranha avenues. With the afforestation of these avenues the administration aimed to improve the air quality of the main regions of the city and increase ecological tourism in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |last=EcoViagem |title=Paulínia-SP ganhou corredores urbanos arborizados |url=http://ecoviagem.uol.com.br/noticias/ambiente/paulinia-sp-ganhou-corredores-urbanos-arborizados-4556.asp |access-date=2009-02-18}}</ref>

==== Highways ====
[[File:Tapetão.jpg|left|thumb|View of SP-332, the only state highway that passes through the town.]]
The main access to other cities in Paulínia is SP-332, or [[Rodovia Professor Zeferino Vaz|Professor Zeferino Vaz highway]], which connects it to Campinas and Cosmópolis, and also to [[Rodovia Dom Pedro I|Dom Pedro I highway]]. Another external access to Paulínia is through the [[Rodovia Doutor Roberto Moreira|Doutor Roberto Moreira highway]], which connects the city to [[Barão Geraldo]]. Prefeito José Lozano Araújo highway connects Paulínia to the cities of Sumaré and [[Hortolândia]], and to Anhanguera and Bandeirantes highways.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leandro Pereira |title=Estrada que liga Paulínia a via-Anhanguera em trecho que corta Sumaré é um verdadeiro "queijo suíço" diz usuário |url=http://www.paulinianews.com.br/?pg=noticia&id=3669 |access-date=2009-05-03 |website=Paulínia News}}</ref> Other exits from Paulínia are [[PLN 311]], located in the São José district and which connects to Cosmópolis and Americana,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Câmara Municipal |title=Projeto de pavimentação da Rodovia Americana-Paulínia-Cosmópolis (PLN 311) |url=http://cmpaulinia.sinoinformatica.com.br/camver/INDICA/1998/00065.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226162652/http://cmpaulinia.sinoinformatica.com.br/camver/INDICA/1998/00065.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-26 |access-date=2009-05-03}}</ref> and PLN 313,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Guia apontador. |title=Guia apontador. |url=http://www.apontador.com.br/guia_de_ruas/sp/paulinia/353044332/rod_pln_313.html |access-date=2009-05-03}}</ref> which crosses the João Aranha, Viacava, Marieta Dian and Recanto das Águas districts, and also gives access to Americana and Cosmópolis, etc. Most of Paulínia's avenues are duplicated and most neighborhoods have paved streets, including some rural roads.<ref name=":28" /> Paulínia has the PLN 110 Road Complex, which provides access to various highways and avenues in the city.<ref name=":29" />

==== Collective Transportation ====
Paulínia has about 15 circular bus lines that lead to all neighborhoods in the city. The city government subsidizes 56% of the value of the circular bus fare, which is equivalent to R$1.00.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Conheça Paulínia |title=Paulínia vai subsidiar 56% da passagem de ônibus |url=http://www.conhecapaulinia.com.br/component/content/article/660 |access-date=2010-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Paulínia News |title=Vereadores aprovam subsídio ao transporte coletivo |url=http://www.paulinianews.com.br/?pg=noticia&id=9379 |access-date=2010-03-11}}</ref> The main problems in Paulínia's public transportation are bus delays and crowding, results of a large number of users and the small number of vehicles circulating in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Leandro Pereira |title=Leandro Pereira |url=http://www.deficienteonline.net.br/site/8-noticias/ultimas/886-novos-mas-pequenos |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120802110845/http://www.deficienteonline.net.br/site/8-noticias/ultimas/886-novos-mas-pequenos |archive-date=2012-08-02 |access-date=2010-12-22 |website=deficienteonline.net.br |publication-date=2010-10-14}}</ref>

==== Railroad Transportation ====
[[File:Ciclo Paulínia João Aranha.jpg|thumb|Bike path on João Aranha Avenue, in the neighborhood of the same name.]]
Paulínia is currently crossed by a railroad which connects Replan to other important regions. This railroad is part of the [[Ferrovia Paulista S/A|FEPASA railroad system]], and near the [[Doutor Roberto Moreira Highway]] it splits, with one part going to [[Jaguariúna]] and the other to REPLAN and Cosmópolis.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mapa da região de bifurcação da FEPASA em Paulínia |url=http://maps.google.com.br/maps?sourceid=chrome&q=paul%C3%ADnia&ie=UTF8&split=0&gl=br&ei=2EvFSafyI5TxnQeM9MXaDQ&ll=-22.773333,-47.110062&spn=0.082464,0.11055&z=13&iwloc=addr |access-date=2009-03-21 |website=Google Maps}}</ref> A partnership between the companies [[América Latina Logística S/A|ALL]] and [[Katoen Natie]] has built a railroad linking Paulínia to the [[Port of Santos]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Paulínia News |title=Parceria entre ALL e Katoen Natie cria o primeiro terminal multimodal que liga Paulínia ao Porto de Santos por linha férrea |url=http://www.paulinianews.com.br/?id=4950&pg=noticia |access-date=2010-02-21}}</ref> that facilitates the transport of containers from Paulínia.

==== Bike paths ====
Until the mid-1990s Paulínia had no bike path. In this period it was built a bike path on the central ridges of João Aranha, Fausto Pietrobom and Paulista Avenues, about 4.5&nbsp;km long. Subsequently, a bike path was built on the central median of Antônio Batista Piva Avenue, measuring just over 1&nbsp;km in length. There are also lanes for pedestrians and cyclists on the sidewalk of Duque de Caxias, José Paulino and José Lozano Araújo Avenues.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bonavita sugere construção de ciclovias |url=http://vejapaulinia.com.br/vereadores_detalhes.php?id=1850 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20240525180633/https://www.webcitation.org/65UlaGiOQ?url=http://vejapaulinia.com.br/vereadores_detalhes.php%3Fid=1850 |archive-date=2024-05-25 |access-date=2010-02-21 |website=vejapaulinia.com.br}}</ref>

== Culture and leisure ==
[[File:Pq ecológico Paulínia.jpg|left|thumb|Paulínia's Ecological Park Armando Müller.]]
Among Paulínia's main leisure spots are São Bento Square, José Paulino Avenue, and Sagrado Coração de Jesus Square, where several events take place during the year.<ref name=":25" />

Paulínia's municipal ecological park Armando Müller, located in the central region of the city, is used by the population for leisure and recreation. People use it to picnic and enjoy nature, since the park contains several animal and plant species. The large number of plants and trees at the site earns it the nickname "''bosquinho''" (English: little forest).<ref name=":30">{{Cite web |title=Parque Zoológico Municipal de Paulínia |url=http://bicharada.net/animais/zoos.php?id=60 |access-date=2010-03-08 |website=Bicharada.net}}</ref><ref name=":25" /> Occupying an area of 65,000&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> and divided into various ecosystems, the park has a total of 398 species, 240 wild, 41 exotic, and 117 domestic.<ref name=":30" />

Another choice for leisure and culture is represented by the Municipal Theater of Paulínia, opened on July 4, 2008, built to receive, besides plays, events related to cinema, presentation of dances, besides other shows. The theater is also the stage for ''Paulínia Magia do Cinema'', one of the main events in the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mostra Paulínia Magia do Cinema atrai 47 mil pessoas |url=http://www.cineclick.com.br/noticia/carregar/titulo/mostra-paulinia-magia-do-cinema-atrai-47-mil-pessoas/id/20221 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121231100141/http://www.cineclick.com.br/noticia/carregar/titulo/mostra-paulinia-magia-do-cinema-atrai-47-mil-pessoas/id/20221 |archive-date=2012-12-31 |access-date=2008-07-04 |website=cineclick.com.br}}</ref>

=== Cuisine ===
In Paulínia's menu, as well as in a large part of the state, it is common to find rice and beans, the basis of the meals, and steak, chicken, sausage, ground meat, and lettuce and tomato salad as side dishes. Due to its historical past, Paulínia is influenced by Italian cuisine, with the presence of pizza, pasta, sauces, etc. Besides these dishes, the so-called [[Caipira food|''caipira'' food]], a set of typical dishes from the countryside of São Paulo, is very popular in the city. Among this type of food, several types of ''[[farofa]]s'', ''caipira'' chicken, and ''[[pamonha]]'' stand out. The [[Sugarcane juice|sugarcanejuice]], ''[[paçoca]]'', and, more recently, the so-called fast dishes, which have been conquering more and more space in the country, are also popular.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Conhecendo a Culinária Brasileira - Regiões Sul e Sudeste |url=http://cyberdiet.terra.com.br/conhecendo-a-culinaria-brasileira-regioes-sul-e-sudeste-2-1-1-458.html |access-date=2010-07-30 |website=Cyberdiet}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=A Pauliniwood Brasileira |url=http://www.cenacine.com.br/?p=2440 |access-date=2010-07-30 |website=CENA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Influência da Globalização: No hábito alimentar e na saúde da população brasileira |url=http://www.webartigos.com/articles/20830/1/INFLUENCIA-DA-GLOBALIZACAO-NO-HABITO-ALIMENTAR-E-NA-SAUDE-DA-POPULACAO-BRASILEIRA/pagina1.html |access-date=2010-07-30 |website=CENA}}</ref> In Campinas there is the Campinas Gastronomic Festival, which brings together restaurants from the city and the region, preparing countless typical local dishes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Festival Gastronômico de Campinas de 2010 |url=http://www.muitomaiscampinas.com/ |access-date=2010-07-30 |website=Sítio oficial.}}</ref>

=== Arts ===
The fact that the city is home to [[Agostinho Batista de Freitas]], a ''[[Naïve art|naïve]]'' painter who characterized himself as a painter of urban landscapes, and who was presented at the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1961, stands out in the art of São Paulo.<ref>{{Cite web |title=A obra de Agostinho Batista de Freitas - SP |url=http://revistaraiz.uol.com.br/portal/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1558&Itemid=163 |access-date=2010-05-02 |publisher=Revista Raiz |publication-date=2009-10-17}}</ref> Furthermore, the city does not have an art scene of national importance, except for the performing arts. The main artistic event in the city is Expo Art, an event held annually since 2008, which aims to promote artists from São Paulo.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Um mês dedicado aos artistas de Paulínia |url=http://www.paulinianews.com.br/?pg=noticia&id=8547 |access-date=2010-05-30}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=2a. Expo Art. PaulíniA |url=http://www.pauliniaemfoco.com.br/index.php?pg=evento&id=142 |access-date=2010-05-30}}</ref>

In the city there is a program aimed at fostering art in the municipality called ''Espaço Ação & Arte'' (English: Action & Art Space). The program, coordinated by Paulínia's Community Action Center (CACO), aims to qualify people, generating work and income through the appreciation of artistic activities. The program's main action is the handicraft workshops, which promote the learning of craft techniques, such as fabric painting, embroidery, and knitting.<ref name="cadepaulinia.com">{{Cite web |title=Caco lança atividades do programa Espaço Ação & Arte |url=http://www.cadepaulinia.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=18026:caco-lanca-atividades-do-programa-espaco-acao-a-arte&catid=58:paulinia&Itemid=472 |access-date=2010-07-30 |publication-date=2010-03-12}}</ref>

=== Literature and performing arts ===
Paulínia has little tradition in literature and performing arts, but in spite of this, with the advent of the project ''Paulínia Magia do Cinema'', these artistic manifestations have been more encouraged by the administration. In 2009, there was the Analysis and Merit Process for Obtaining the Professional Qualification Certificate from SATED/SP, which qualified 27 performing arts professionals, the largest recorded in the interior of São Paulo up to that date.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Vinte e sete novos postulantes às artes cênicas são profissionalizados em Paulínia |url=http://www.rmcnoticias.com.br/index.php?pg=noticia&id=11226 |access-date=2010-02-21 |website=rmcnoticias |publication-date=2009-06-23}}</ref> In the same year the ''[[Virada Cultural Paulista]]'' took place in the city, and the highlight in the scenic arts was a children's musical from the city itself.<ref name=":31">{{Cite web |title=Teatro de Paulínia se destaca na "Virada Cultural Paulista |url=http://paulinia.net/semanario-oficial-798 |access-date=2012-02-04 |publisher=Jornal Cidade de Rio Claro Ltda. |publication-date=2009-06-01}}</ref>

Some artistic institutions that stand out in the city are Ceart-Center for the Arts in Paulínia and the Culture Space (''Magia do Cinema'' School).<ref name=":17" /><ref name=":31" /> The first is a theater group that performs musicals such as ''[[Os Saltimbancos]]'', ''Para Viver um Grande Amor'' (with poems from the book of the same name by [[Vinicius de Moraes]]) and ''[[Roda Viva (play)|Roda Viva]]''.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Musical "Os Saltimbancos" no Teatro de Paulínia |url=http://www.paulinia.sp.gov.br/uploads/semanarios/semanario-818.pdf |access-date=2010-02-21 |publisher=Prefeitura de Paulínia |publication-date=2009-10-21}}</ref> The group is formed by actors from Paulínia and its cast interprets and sings live on stage.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Alunos do ensino médio assistem musical "Para Viver um Grande Amor |url=http://www.paulinia.sp.gov.br/uploads/semanarios/semanario-818.pdf |access-date=2010-02-21 |publisher=Prefeitura de Paulínia |page=1 |publication-date=2009-10-21}}</ref> The ''Magia do Cinema'' School, on the other hand, is an initiative of the city hall through the project ''[[Paulínia Magia do Cinema]]''. It offers courses in the areas of cinema, theater, dance, and music, such as stage characterization, dramatic literature, history of art and theater, among others.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Secretaria de Cultura abre inscrições para Cinema, Dança, Música e Teatro |url=http://paulinia.net/semanario-oficial-833 |access-date=2010-02-21 |website=Paulínia: Jornal Cidade de Rio Claro Ltda |publisher=Semanário Oficial do Município de Paulínia |pages=01–03 |publication-date=2010-01-25}}</ref> This school, in partnership with [[Fundação Getulio Vargas|Getulio Vargas Foundation]] and Senac, aims to train qualified professionals in the area of cinema and theater to enter the job market created with the project ''Paulínia Magia do Cinema''.<ref>{{Cite web |title='12 Estrelas' utiliza 214 figurantes de Paulínia |url=http://cinemapaulinia.com.br/portal/?p=212 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130424084129/http://cinemapaulinia.com.br/portal/?p=212 |archive-date=2013-04-24 |access-date=2010-02-21 |website=Paulínia News |publication-date=2009-03-30}}</ref> In Paulínia's literature, the highlight is Raimundo Lonato, who has written several books for children and teenagers, literature-reportage and poems.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Obras de Raimundo Lonato |url=http://www.estantevirtual.com.br/qau/raimundo-lonato |access-date=2010-02-21 |publication-date=2008-11-28}}</ref> The writer has already been present in events such as the Porto Alegre Book Fair and the 20th São Paulo Biennial Book Fair.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jornal Todo Dia |title=Manchetes (seção Bienal) |url=http://www2.uol.com.br/tododia/ano2004/abril/250404/eviden.htm |access-date=2010-02-21 |publication-date=2004-04-25}}</ref>

=== Sports ===
[[File:Estádio Luís Perissinoto - Paulínia.jpg|left|thumb|The [[Estádio Municipal Luís Perissinotto|Luís Perissinotto Municipal Stadium]], with capacity for 10,070 people, is used for soccer matches and is Paulínia's home ground.]]
Soccer has always been one of the most popular sports in Paulínia. Before emancipation, [[bocce]] shared with soccer the title of most popular sport in the locality. After emancipation, the first municipal incentive for sports was the creation of the Municipal Sports Commission by Mayor [[Vicente Amante|Vicente Amatte]], in 1973. After some time, the agency became subordinated to the Sports and Tourism Sector (Setur). In 1976, Setur's supervisor, Ary Rodriguez, created the Workers' Sports Games, which are still a success in the city today.<ref name=":32">{{Cite journal |last=Valente |first=Fernanda Marques |title=Esporte também faz parte da cidade |journal=Revista Tribuna |location=Paulínia |pages=34–36}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Arneg |title=XXXI JOGOS DESPORTIVOS DOS TRABALHADORES DE PAULÍNIA - 2007 |url=http://www.arneg.com.br/portugues/noticias.asp?not=26 |archive-date=2008-06-23 |website=[[Internet Archive]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080623003406/http://www.arneg.com.br/portugues/noticias.asp?not=26 }}</ref>

In 1993, the then mayor Edson Moura created the Secretariat of Sports and Recreation. From then on, several projects to encourage the practice of sports were developed, such as the participation in Regional Games and in the [[Countryside Open Games]]. In 2005 the city had the best passage through the Open Games to that date: 3rd place, behind Campinas and [[Araras]].<ref name=":32" /> Other events organized by Secretariat are the vacation gymkhana, which is in its 20th edition; the Municipal Futsal Championship, which went to its 25th edition in 2010.<ref name=":32" />

Recently, soccer has been highlighted again with [[Paulínia FC|Paulínia Futebol Clube]], the first professional club in the city that competes in the B series of the [[Campeonato Paulista]]. The city also has the Luís Perissinoto Municipal Stadium and several fields. Teams often train at Paulínia's training centers or at the stadium, due to the good conditions of the grass.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bragantino tenta frear motivação do Mirassol |url=http://www.futebolpaulista.com.br/clube.php?cod=20&ref=1&txt=21570 |access-date=2021-02-01 |website=futebolpaulista.com.br}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Equipe do Noreoste de Bauru treina em Paulínia |url=http://www.rmcnoticias.com.br/index.php?pg=noticia&id=9218 |access-date=2011-01-27 |website=rmcnoticias.com.br}}</ref> The Paulínia Amateur Soccer Championship also takes place in the municipality, which has been played since 1970. In 2010 the tournament was divided into two divisions, with 16 teams in the First Division and 41 teams in the Second, and in 2011 the Second Division had only 16 teams, and the Third Division was created. The games are held in several different locations, being the fields in the Morumbi, Santa Cecilia, São José, Serra Azul, the Etori di'Blásio Sports Center (Monte Alegre neighborhood), the Waldemar Perissinoto square sports center, and the Agostinho Fávaro Gymnasium field (João Aranha neighborhood).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Abertura do Campeonato Amador de Futebol |url=http://www.paulinia.sp.gov.br/noticias.aspx?id=344 |access-date=2010-07-28 |website=paulinia.sp.gov.br |publication-date=2010-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Confira a tabela do Campeonato Amador de Paulínia |url=http://www.paulinianews.com.br/v5/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7133:confira-a-tabela-do-campeonato-amador-de-paulinia&catid=54:paulinia&Itemid=47 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/650p734ec?url=http://www.paulinianews.com.br/v5/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=7133:confira-a-tabela-do-campeonato-amador-de-paulinia&catid=54:paulinia&Itemid=47 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-01-27 |access-date=2012-01-27 |website=paulinianews.com.br}}</ref>

Paulínia has a great tradition in [[BMX|motocross]], with one of the best teams in Brazil. The Petrobrás/Paulínia team has several Brazilian, State and international titles. The team originated in the Paulínia Racing Bicicross project,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Paulinia RB |title=Paulínia Racing Bicicross |url=http://www.pauliniabmx.com.br/ |publication-date=2009-01-20}}</ref> created by the city hall to encourage the sport in the city. Currently, the team is seven-time Brazilian and São Paulo State champion.
