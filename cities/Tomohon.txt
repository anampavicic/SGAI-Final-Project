Tomohon has been written of in several historical records. One of them was found in the ethnographic works of Reverend Nicolaas Graafland, written on 14 January 1864. He described a heart-capturing country on the Minahasa highland in Northern Celebes (''Sulawesi'') called Tomohon that he had visited in 1850.<ref name="graafland_144">{{Harvnb|Graafland|1867|p=144}}</ref> The development of civilization and the dynamics of development and social implementation from year to year made Tomohon one of the capital districts in the Minahasa regency.<ref name="graafland_146-147">{{Harvnb|Graafland|1867|pp=146–147}}</ref> In the beginning, Tomohon was a district of the Toumbulu people located in northwestern Minahasa, which consists of Talete, Kamasi, Paslaten, Kolongan, and Matani.<ref name="graafland_147_and_200">{{Harvnb|Graafland|1867|p=147 and 200}}</ref> In 1880, the Sarongsong district was united into Tomohon, and Kakaskasen district was combined in 1908.<ref name="lundström-burghoorn_61">{{Harvnb|Lundström-Burghoorn|1981|p=61}}</ref> In 1927, Tomohon was integrated into [[Manado]] as a district, and in 1935, Tombariri district was combined with Tomohon district under Manado. In 1945, Tomohon was separated from Manado and again became the Tomohon district with two subdistrict: Tomohon and Tombariri. During the ''[[Permesta]]'' between March 1956 and October 1961, some of the Tombariri was combined with Tomohon. In 1974–2003, Tomohon was a [[List of districts of Indonesia|district]] under the [[Minahasa Regency]].<ref name="lundström-burghoorn_61"/><ref name="kojongian_20-26">{{Harvnb|Kojongian|1986|pp=20–26}}</ref>

In the early decades of the 2000s, people in some parts of the Minahasa regency bore inspiration and aspirations of the strategic environmental trends both internally and externally for regional expansion. Efforts at reformation and the implementation of regional autonomy had been accelerating the process of accommodation people's aspirations for the expansion of the region. Through a long legal process and mature consideration in order to accelerate national development for the welfare of society, then the Minahasa regency government along with the Regional Representatives Council (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah'' - ''DPRD'') of Minahasa Regency recommended the aspirations for the establishment of South Minahasa Regency, Tomohon and North Minahasa Regency; which was also supported by The Provincial Government of North Sulawesi. The formation of South Minahasa Regency and Tomohon was established by the Central Government by issuing the Act No. 10 of 2003 and the establishment of the North Minahasa Regency through Act No. 33 of 2003.<ref>{{cite web|title=Undang-Undang Republik Indonesia Nomor 33 Tahun 2003 |url=http://www.bpkp.go.id/uu/filedownload/2/40/278.bpkp |publisher=Badan Pengawasan Keuangan dan Pembangunan |access-date=13 July 2017|language=id}}</ref>

==Community based ecotourism==
In general, Community Based [[Ecotourism]] (CBET) is tourism that is managed by the community for the tourist destinations. With general tourism, tourist visits are often marketed and organised by private travel companies and government-protected areas where the bulk of the profits go to the private companies and government enterprises. In contrast, CBET is managed and run by the community itself, management decisions are made by local people and profits directly go to the community. CBET itself, is a part of [[sustainable tourism]] development, because it is meets the needs of the present tourists and host regions while protecting and enhancing the opportunity for the future. It is envisaged as leading to management of all resources in such a way that economic, social and aesthetic needs can be fulfilled, while maintaining cultural integrity, essential ecological processes, biological diversity and life support systems (World Tourism Organisation in Bhoj Raj K Hanal, 2007). In order for community based ecotourism to be successful (sustainable), there are many questions that need to be asked and answered in the planning process through implementation stages. One problem of participatory approaches must be pointed out - what defines “community” and “local” in terms of participation? Communities are not free of conflict, nor they are homogeneous. This fact can complicate any development plans for local communities — communities must agree on representatives for decision-making. According to the Quebec Declaration on ecotourism, ecotourism embraces the principles of sustainable tourism. The following principles distinguish it from the wider concept of sustainable tourism:
# Contributes actively to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage; 
# Includes local and indigenous communities in its planning, development and operation contributing to their well-being;
# interprets the natural and cultural heritage of the destination to the visitor; and 
# lends itself better to independent travelers, as well as organizes tours for small sized groups.

==Distinctive features==
There are several colorful parks in the center of the city with various flowers. The local government of Tomohon City routinely holds an annual flower festival which is able to attract many tourists to come to Tomohon. Other tourism destinations include Lake Linow, [[waruga]] ([[sarcophagus]]), [[Tinoor]] waterfall, [[Doahill]], agritourism in [[Rurukan]], wooden house craft center in [[Woloan]], and amphitheater in Woloan.
