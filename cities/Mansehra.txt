==History==

===Ancient period===
{{main|Mansehra Rock Edicts}}[[File:Upper Boulder with Inscriptions - Mansehra Rock Edicts.jpg|thumb|Ashokan inscriptions: [[Major Rock Edicts]] 1 to 14.]]
The region around the present-day city of Mansehra was inhabited by the [[Indo-Aryan migrations|early Indo-Aryans]] since the [[3rd millennium BC]], and was later a part of the ancient kingdom of [[Gandhara (kingdom)|Gandhara]] and the [[Mauryan Empire]]. [[Ashoka]] governed this area as a prince on the [[Maurya Empire|imperial throne]] in {{circa}} 272 BCE. He made it one of the major seats of his government. The [[Edicts of Ashoka]], inscribed on three large boulders near Mansehra record fourteen of Ashoka's edicts, presenting aspects of the emperor's ''dharma'' or righteous law. These represent some of the earliest evidence of deciphered writing in [[the subcontinent]], dating to the middle of the third century BCE, and are written from right to left in the [[Kharosthi]] script.<ref>{{cite web |author=Department of Archaeology and Museums |url=https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1881/ |title=UNESCO world heritage Centre - Mansehra Rock Edicts |publisher=Whc.unesco.org |date=2004-01-30 |access-date=2011-03-30}}</ref> Mauryans were followed by a variety of kingdoms, including [[Kushan Empire|Kushans]], whose most notable ruler, [[Kanishka the Great]], ruled from the nearby city of [[Peshawar|Puruṣapura]]. During this period [[Greco-Buddhist art|Buddhist art and architecture]] flourished in the area.<ref name="google.com">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R4jiAAAAMAAJ&q=Dera+Ismail+Khan+hindu+shahi|title = Ancient Pakistan|year = 1971|publisher = Chairman, Department of Archaeology, University of Peshawar.}}</ref>

===Medieval period ===
The [[Hindu Shahi|Uḍi Śāhis]] were the last great Gandharan dynasty before the [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim conquest of Gandhara]]. They were notable for their impressive [[Hindu Shahis#Culture and architecture|coinage and architecture]], and built a series of temples in the region. They remained in control of the area until their defeat [[Battle of Peshawar (1001)|at Peshawar]] by the [[Ghaznavids]] in the year 1001.<ref name="google.com" /> The region was originally known as [[Pakhli]]; it came to be known as Hazara only after [[Timur]]id invasion in 1399, when Tamerlane assigned it to his local chieftains, namely the [[Hazara-i-Karlugh]], after whom the name of [[Hazara Division]] is derived. [[Hazara region]] comprised Pakhli Sarkar of the [[Mughal Kashmir|Mughal province of Kashmir]], and was administered so until the [[Indian campaign of Ahmad Shah Durrani|Durrani invasions]] by [[ Ahmad Shah Durrani]] in the early 18th century, which resulted into anarchy and severe economic decline. The area was divided among several petty tribal chieftaincies in the following decades, and remained so until the conquest by the [[Sikhs]] in 1818.<ref name=Urasa>{{Cite journal |last=Khan |first=Shakirullah |last2=Zahoor |first2=Muhammad |date=June 2023 |title=The Uraśa State and its capital: Some notes |url=https://jac.qau.edu.pk/index.php/jac/article/view/187 |journal=Journal of Asian Civilizations |language=en-US |publisher=[[Quaid-i-Azam University]] |publication-place=Islamabad |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=49–61}}</ref>

===Modern period===
[[Hari Singh Nalwa]], a Sikh commander of [[Ranjit Singh]], conquered the Hazara region in 1818 by defeating the local chieftains. He governed Hazara from the newly-established city of [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]], named after him. After [[Battle of Jamrud|his death]] in 1837, Hari Singh was succeeded by [[Mahan Singh Hazarawala]] as the [[Nazim]] of Hazara, who founded the modern city of Mansehra. There were popular uprisings against the Sikh rule, but these uprisings failed and the Sikhs remained in power until 1849, when the area came under [[British India|British]] rule.<ref name="Weekes">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gha-BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA5 |page=5 |title=History of the 5th Royal Gurkha Rifles: 1858 to 1928 |first1=Colonel H.

The [[British East India Company]] conquered Mansehra after the defeat of the Sikhs in the [[first Anglo-Sikh War]] in 1846. The British divided Hazara region into three ''[[tehsils]]'' (administrative subdivisions): Mansehra, [[Abbottabad]], and [[Haripur, Pakistan|Haripur]]. Hazara formed part of [[British Punjab|Punjab province]] until 1901, when the British formed the buffer province of [[North-West Frontier Province (1901–1955)|North West Frontier Province]] (NWFP) and Hazara was annexed into it. During the [[British Raj|British rule]], Mansehra was a small town. Its population according to the 1901 census was 5,087.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V17_209.gif |title=Mānsehra Village - Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 17, p. 203 |publisher=Dsal.uchicago.edu |access-date=2011-03-30}}</ref> 

After the [[independence of Pakistan|independence]], Hazara district was elevated to the divisional status in 1976. In the October of the same year Mansehra Tehsil was made district and Mansehra became its headquarters.<ref name=Urasa/>

==Organisation==
Mansehra City is the administrative capital of District and ''Tehsil'' Mansehra. The City of Mansehra is administratively divided into four [[Union Councils of Pakistan|Union Councils]]:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrb.gov.pk/lg_election/union.asp?district=73&dn=Mansehra |title=Tehsils & Unions in the District of Mansehra |publisher=Nrb.gov.pk |access-date=2011-03-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718001117/http://www.nrb.gov.pk/lg_election/union.asp?district=73&dn=Mansehra |archive-date=2011-07-18 }}</ref> Mansehra City Wards {{Abbr|No.|number}} 1–4 and Mansehra (Rural)/suburban.
