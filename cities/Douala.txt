'''Douala''' is the largest city in [[Cameroon]] and its economic capital. It is also the capital of Cameroon's [[Littoral Region (Cameroon)|Littoral Region]]. It was home to Central Africa's largest [[port]], now being replaced by [[Kribi]] port. It has the country’s major international airport, [[Douala International Airport]] (DLA). It is the commercial and economic capital of Cameroon and the entire [[Economic Community of Central African States|CEMAC]] region comprising Gabon, Congo, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic and Cameroon. Consequently, it handles most of the country's major exports, such as [[Petroleum|oil]], [[Cocoa bean|cocoa]] and [[coffee]], timber, metals and fruits. {{As of|2023}}, the city and its surrounding area had an estimated population of 5,066,000.<ref name="citypopulation.de"/> The city sits on the estuary of [[Wouri River]] and its climate is [[tropical]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Douala|History of Cameroon|Kamerun}}
{{see also|List of rulers of the Duala}}
[[File:SMS OLGA bei der Beschießung von Hickorytown (Duala), Kamerun, Dezember 1884.jpg|thumb|left|The German corvette {{SMS|Olga}} at the bombardment of Hickorytown, Cameroon (today Douala) on December 21, 1884]]
The first [[Europe]]ans to visit the area were the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in about 1472. At the time, the estuary of [[Wouri River]] was known as the Rio dos Camarões (Shrimp River). By 1650, it had become the site of a town formed by immigrants, said to have arrived from Congo, who spoke the [[Duala language]]. During the 18th century it was the center of the [[transatlantic slave trade]].

In 1826<ref>Notes from Richard Mother Jackson published in R.-P. Bouchaud 1948 and 1952.</ref> Douala appeared to be made of four different villages located in four specific locations: the village of Deido (Dido), of Akwa, of Njo and Hickory-town (today Bonaberi, located on the other side of Wouri River).

Between 1884 and 1895 the city was a German protectorate.<ref>Britannica,
[https://www.britannica.com/place/Douala Douala], britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref>
The colonial politics focused on commerce and some exploration of the unoccupied territories. In 1885, [[Alfred Saker]] organized the first mission of the British Baptist Church. In the same year the city known as Kamerun was renamed Douala and became the capital of the territory until 1902, when the capital was moved to [[Buéa]].

In 1907 the Ministry of Colonies was established and Douala had 23,000 citizens.<ref name="Diwouta-Kotto, Danièle 2010 p. 42">Diwouta-Kotto, Danièle (2010). ''Suites architecturales: Kinshasa, Douala, Dakar''. Épinal: Association VAA, p. 42.</ref>

After [[World War I]] in 1919, the German colonial territories became French and British protectorates. France received a mandate to administer Douala. A treaty was signed with the local chiefs.

From 1940 to 1946, it was the capital of Cameroon.<ref>Mark Dike DeLancey, Mark W. Delancey, Rebecca Neh Mbuh, ''Historical Dictionary of the Republic of Cameroon'', Rowman & Littlefield, USA, 2019, p. 176</ref> In 1955 the city had over 100,000 inhabitants.<ref name="Diwouta-Kotto, Danièle 2010 p. 42"/>

In 1960, Cameroon gained independence as a federal republic, with its capital in [[Yaoundé]]. Douala became the major economic city. In 1972, the federal republic became a unitary state. Douala then had a population of around 500,000.<ref name="Diwouta-Kotto, Danièle 2010 p. 42"/>

In the 1980s, in Cameroon the struggle for liberalization and [[Multi-party system|multi-party democracy]] grew. Between May and December 1991, Douala was at the center of the civil disobedience campaign called the ghost town operation (''ville morte'') during which economic activities shut down to make the country ungovernable and to force the government to allow multi-partitism and freedom of expression.<ref>Edmond Kamguia Koumchou (2003), ''Le Journalisme du Carton Rouge''.

=== Name ===
With the arrival of the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] in the 15th century, the area was known as ''Rio dos Camarões''. Before coming under [[Germany|German]] rule in 1884,<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|title=Cameroon and the German Lake Chad Railway|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/640|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|access-date=16 February 2017}}</ref> the town was also known as '''Cameroons Town'''; thereafter it became '''Kamerunstadt''' ("Cameroon City"), the capital of [[German Kamerun]].  It was renamed Douala in 1907 after the name of the natives known as Dua ala Ijaws (Njos), and became part of French Cameroon in 1919. Many of the Ijaw (Njo) natives migrated to the Niger Delta in Nigeria during the Portuguese era.

With 1.9 million inhabitants in 2005, Douala is the most populated city of [[Cameroun|Cameroon]].

===Languages===
{{see also|Languages of Cameroon}}

Cameroon is home to nearly 250 languages or dialects.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Kouega |first=Jean-Paul |title=The Language Situation in Cameroon |journal=Current Issues in Language Planning |volume=8 |issue=1 |year=2007 |pages=3–94 |doi=10.2167/cilp110.0 |s2cid=143923073 }}</ref> The local indigenous language is [[Duala language|Duala]], which shares its name with the city. [[French language|French]] and [[English language|English]] are official languages, but Douala is primarily [[francophone]].
In 2014, 63.7% of Douala inhabitants of over 15 years knew how to read and write French, while 76.4% knew how to speak and understand French.<ref>''La langue française dans le monde'', Éditions Nathan, 2014, p. 30.</ref>

==Urbanism and contemporary life==
The city of Douala is divided into seven districts ([[Akwa, Douala|Akwa]], [[Bassa, Douala|Bassa]], [[Bonabéri]], [[Bonapriso]], [[Bonanjo]], [[Deïdo]] and [[New Bell]])<ref>"Douala, Cameroon", in Dickson Eyoh, Paul Tiyambe Zeleza (eds), ''Encyclopedia of Twentieth Century African History'', Routledge, 2002, p. 151.</ref> and it has more than 120 neighbourhoods.

Some of the neighbourhoods of Douala include
* [[Akwa, Douala|Akwa]]. Akwa is Douala's business district and Bonanjo its administrative district. ''Plateau Joss'' is the name used historically for the current district of Akwa. The name of the districts refer to the Douala lineage, as well as the neighborhoods. For example, Akwa was historically divided between Bell and Deido into Bonadibong, Bonamilengue, Boneleke, Bonalembe, Bonejang, Bonamuti, Bonabekombo, Bonaboijan, and Bonakuamuang; the prefix "bona" means "descendant of".

* [[Ball, Douala|Bali]], housing area located near Bonanjo administrative area.
* [[Bépanda]] is a very densely populated  neighbourhood. It is probably the most inhabited area of the city with many residents having arrived from West Africa and from all parts of the country. The seat of the University of Douala and an important telecommunication centre of Cameroon's telecommunications are located there.
* [[Deido]] is a historical neighborhood located in the north central part of the city. It includes one of the main junctions of the city known as Le Rond-Point Deïdo and the symbol of the city “the Njounjou” (“the monster”).
* [[Bonaberi]] is located on the right bank of the Wouri River. It is primarily an industrial neighbourhood but is gradually becoming a mixed area including more residential and commercial areas. It is connected by the two only bridges of the city. It is also the main opening toward the western anglophone area of the country.
* [[Bonapriso]] is one of the wealthiest area of the city and even of the country. Historically a residential neighbourhood, it has become a mixed area including  commercial galleries, restaurants and shops.
* [[Bonanjo]] is the administrative neighborhood, with many large administrations, larger companies and banks offices, with higher buildings than the rest of the city
* [[Bonamoussadi]] is the main housing area located in the northern part of the city. In a first time very residential, it has recently witnessed a significant surge in the installation of malls, supermarkets, restaurants and even night clubs.
* [[Kotto, Douala|Kotto]] is a modern residential neighbourhood next to Bonamoussadi. It developed in the early 1980s with the housing projects of the Société immobilière du Cameroun (SIC) and is now the prime area for the small but increasing  middle and upper classes of the city.
* [[New Bell, Douala|New Bell]] is an historical neighbourhood of the city. It was founded in the early 20th century with the expropriation by the Germans of the natives Duala people from the plateau Joss. It has been known since then for housing newcomers in the city from all parts of the country and even from abroad (mainly west Africa). It today a very populous neighbourhood with very tough conditions. Two of the main markets of the city (Central market and Marché Nkololoun) are in the area.

* [[Bassa, Douala|Bassa]] is a vast area in the eastern part of the city. It is a mixed area including  many neighborhoods (some wealthier than others) such as Logbaba, Ndogpassi, Cité des Palmiers, PK 8 and many others. It also includes one of the two major industrial zones of the city (the other being in Bonaberi).

According to Jacques Soulillou,<ref>Jacques Soulillou (1989), ''Douala, un siècle en images''. Paris: L'Harmattan, p. 9.</ref> historical images of Douala document the areas of Akwa (Plateau Joss) and the port between 1860 and 1960, while the districts of Bonaberi, Deido and New Bell have almost no images. The archives which provide documentation about the city are based in Paris,<ref>French national archives, Section Outre-mer and Département des Estampes; Documentation Français, Photothèque Afrique; Archives des Pères du Saint-Esprit; Archives des Missions des Églises Évangeliques; Agence France Press.</ref> Basel,<ref>Archives of Mission 21.</ref> Hamburg,<ref>Welwirtschafsvelten; Deutsch Afrika Linien.</ref> Potsdam,<ref>Staatliche Archivverwaltung.</ref> Douala<ref>Archive Photo Prunet.</ref> and Yaoundé.<ref>Goethe Institut.</ref>

In 1896 a first urban plan of the city was developed during the German colonial period. The plan included a [[Former general Hospital of Douala|hospital]], the [[Old German government headquarters in Douala|governor residency]], the palace of justice, the [[Former police station of Douala|police station]], administrative buildings and buildings for the port and customs (among those the [[Old Woermann Linie Bachelors House in Douala|Old Woermann Linie Bachelors House]]). The [[Bonakouamouang Chimney]] also dates back to this period. In 1904 construction of the [[Villa Mandessi Bell]] was begun. In 1905 the [[Palace of the Kings Bell|palace of the King Manga Ndumbe Bell]] (also called la Pagode) was built, and in 1906 the general plan of Gross Douala was established. In 1914 the large population living in Bonanjo was moved to the new estate of Neue Bell (New Bell).

Between 1925 and 1930, during the French colonial period, the [[Chamber of Commerce (Douala 1927-1928)|chamber of commerce]], the [[Former palace of Justice of Douala|new palace of justice]], the new railway station, the [[vault of the Kings Bell]] and the catholic [[Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul, Douala|cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul]] were built. Constructions were intensified between 1930 and 1955 and in 1955 the bridge on Wouri River was built. In 1935 the [[Mausoleum of the Kings Akwa]] was constructed. In 1947 the [[Temple of the Centenary in Douala|Temple of the Centenary]] was built. In 1959 a new city plan was designed (Plan Dorian); according to Danièle Diwouta-Kotto,<ref name="Diwouta-Kotto, Danièle 2010 p. 42"/> this plan is still influencing Douala's urban development. After the independence of 1960 a new development and urban plan were established. In 1998 a research prepared the diagnostic for the 2015 horizon. In 2005 a new development and urban plan was designed and routes and public canalizations were reestablished and created. In the same year the Project Sawa-Beach was  launched. Since 1888, terracotta bricks have been  produced in Douala.<ref name="Diwouta-Kotto, Danièle 2010 p. 42"/>

The publication ''Suites architecturales''<ref name="Diwouta-Kotto, Danièle 2010 p. 42"/> focuses on heritage and reappropriation in the architecture of Douala, and it presents some of the characteristics of the buildings and architecture of Douala after its independence. Among those buildings are the casino, the show-room La Meublerie, the exhibition hall Cami-Toyota, [[Union Bank of Cameroon]], Immeuble Hollando, the Baptist church, Immeuble Victoria, headquarters of CA-SCB, [[doual'art|espace doual'art]], and Orange Flagship. The [[Palace Dika Akwa Mukanda]] was built in 1990.

Along the city's main thoroughfare lie some of Cameroon's best restaurants, coffee houses and French-style [[patisserie]]s; along the waterfront, many bars and bistros may be found, commanding views of the [[Gulf of Guinea]] and nearby [[mangrove]] swamps.  Many of these are frequented by the city's large [[expatriate]] population, mainly French or Lebanese, most of whom work in the [[petroleum industry]].{{cn|date=December 2021}}

== Culture ==

A small community has begun to practice [[Judaism]] in Douala, but they do not have a synagogue yet.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.africansynagogues.org/html/communities.html |title=A SYNOPSIS OF THE JEWS OF SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA |publisher=Sub-Saharan African Synagogues |accessdate=2023-03-16}}</ref>

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Cameroon}}
As in most large cities in Cameroon there are several [[Nursery school|nursery]], [[Primary school|primary]], [[Secondary school|secondary]] and [[high school]]s in the city. In recent years there has been a surge in the number of private schools. {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} It is interesting to note that there is also a large, informal educational sector that caters to a huge part of the population, mostly individuals with a primary school certificate or those with no education at all. {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} This form of education is common in sectors like cloth manufacturing, bread making, construction, security, and car repairing. Individuals from these informal sectors are by far the most visibly deprived in neighborhoods such as Ndokoti, Bepanda, Village, Logbaba.

The city of Douala is home to a number of higher education institutions, including the [[University of Douala]].<ref>Presidential act n° 93/030 of 19 January 1993.</ref> There are also a number of professional schools, the most prominent one being the Douala Maritime institute. Douala has an [[aviation school]] called [[CAE Oxford Aviation Academy Douala]].

Douala is linked by [[Camrail|rail]] to [[Yaoundé]], [[Ngaoundéré]], [[Kumba]] and [[Nkongsamba]]. Douala has a fairly developed road network compared to other cities in Cameroon. However many of the city's roads have decayed due to years of neglect and corruption. Efforts have recently been made to renovate the city's roads, especially in the most deprived neighborhoods. In spite of the numerous domestic and international investments, the roads remain in deplorable state largely due to embezzlement and corruption. {{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

A [[Bus rapid transit|brt]] network is planned for Douala, with the first 3 lines projected to open in 2024-2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.metro-report.com/news/single-view/view/douala-tram-project-poised-to-launch.html|title=Douala tram project poised to launch|date=15 February 2019}}</ref>{{needs update|date=July 2023}}

The [[Douala International Airport]] is located in the eastern part of the city. There are direct flights to several European cities, including [[Paris]], [[Brussels]], and [[Istanbul]]. Regional and continental destinations include [[Abidjan]], [[Brazzaville]], [[Dakar]], [[Johannesburg]], [[Kinshasa]], [[Lagos]], [[Malabo]], and [[Nairobi]]. The airport is the busiest in the [[CEMAC]] area and is the hub for Cameroon's national carrier, Camairco. The airport is in dire need of renovations due to poor circulation and old infrastructure.

The [[seaport]] has {{convert|8.5|m|abbr=off}} of [[Draft (ship)|draft]].

== Economy ==
Douala is a city with a modest oil resource in Africa, but is in excellent agricultural condition, therefore it has one of best economies in Africa. However, it also faces some problems like other underdeveloped countries such as heavy civil service and bad climate (flood, tornado, storm) to business.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}}

Main economic parameters are:

*'''GDP:''' $42.2 billion (2006 est.):
* '''GDP growth rate''': 4.1% (2006 est.)
* '''Exports-partners''': Spain 17.3%, Italy 13.8%, France 9.5%, South Korea 8.1%, UK 8.1%, Netherlands 7.9%, Belgium 4.9%, US 4.3% (2005)
*'''Imports - partners''': France 21%, Nigeria 15%, Belgium 6.3%, China 5.6%, US 5.1%, Thailand 4.5%, Germany 4.2% (2005)

=== Wealth and poverty ===
Even though Douala is the economic center of Cameroon, a large percentage of its inhabitants live below the poverty line. Recent data shows that about thirty percent of the population lives in poverty (Avameg, Inc). While the aforementioned percentage is doubled for rural regions, poverty is a growing problem for Douala due to its steadily increasing population. Unlike the rural populations of Cameroon that can grow their own foods to lessen their expenses, Douala locals are disadvantaged by living in the port city where there are not many opportunities for monetary gain.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Cameroon.html|title=Cameroon|website=www.nationsencyclopedia.com|access-date=12 November 2016}}</ref>
