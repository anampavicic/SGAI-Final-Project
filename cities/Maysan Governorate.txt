'''Maysan Governorate''' ({{langx|ar|ميسان|translit=Maysān or Mīsān}}) is a [[Governorates of Iraq|governorate]] in southeastern [[Iraq]], bordering [[Iran]]. Its administrative centre is the city of [[Amarah]], and it is composed of six districts. Before 1976, it was named Amara Province.

==Etymology==
This region was called ''Messène'' ({{lang|grc|Μεσσήνη}}) by [[Ancient Greeks]] ([[Strabo]]), ''Mīšān'' (ܡܝܫܢ) in [[Classical Syriac|Syriac]]. ''Mēs̲h̲ān'' in [[Middle Persian]] and [[Parthian language|Parthian]] ({{lang|xpr|𐭌𐭉𐭔𐭍}} myšn), ''Mēs̲h̲un'' in [[Armenian language|Armenian]], ''Maysān'' or ''Mīsān'' ({{lang|ar|ميسان}}) in [[Arabic]], and ''T’iao-tche'' ([[Chaldaea]]) in the [[Han Chinese|Han]] sources.<ref name="SM">Streck, M.; Morony, M.. "Maysān." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. , 2012. Reference. 30 March 2012</ref>

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2023}}
{{further|Sumer}}

[[Alexander the Great]] founded the town of [[Charax Spasinu]] in 324 B.C. in the governorate. The town later became the capital of the [[Characene]] kingdom. It now exists as the ruins of [[Naysān (Iraq)|Naysan]].

The area suffered greatly during the [[Iran–Iraq War]], during which it was a major battlefield, and again after the [[1991 Iraqi uprising]].<ref>{{Citation |last=Shepperson |first=Mary |title=A Parthian city in the Iran–Iraq War |date=2021-05-19 |work=Conflict Landscapes |pages=344–360 |url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4324/9781003149552-23 |access-date=2024-04-10 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-003-14955-2}}</ref>

==Government==
===Ba'athist era===
From 1992 to 1994, [[Saddam Hussein]] appointed a senior military commander named [[Kamel Sajid]], who had served during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] and led special forces missions into Kuwait, during the [[Gulf War]], to become the governor, following a decision to replace all provincial governors with military ones. Under Janabi's administration he reportedly introduced [[Islamization|stronger Islamic policies]], which coincided with Saddam's [[faith campaign]] at the time.

Saddam Hussein's brother-in-law who visited the province commented on Janabi's administration, saying he had built a "mini Islamic state". Janabi  ordered the closure of all bars serving alcohol, and built several mosques across the province. He would also collect money for donations to the sick and poor, as well as visit hospitals. Janabi also reprimanded a police officer for allowing his car to cut through traffic, after the officer noticed it was the governor's car. Locals reportedly referred to him as "Abu Omar" in reference to Umayyad Caliph [[Umar II]], viewing Janabi's rule as similar. He also reportedly spared the life of a Shia man who was cooperating with Iran in the province and had turned himself in to Iraqi security forces.

In 1994, Janabi was relieved from his position and sent to work for Saddam in Baghdad instead. Many Ba'athist officials criticized both Saddam and Janabi for their religiousness, and told Saddam that Janabi was a fifth-column element in the regime. However, Saddam dismissed these claims in his favor, and Janabi himself was reportedly loyal to Saddam.

===Post-2003===
The current governor is [[Ali Dawai Lazem]], a supporter of [[Muqtada al-Sadr]]. As of 2013, he is the only provincial governor in Iraq belonging to the [[Sadrist Movement]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jaboori |first1=Rafid |title=Sectarian tensions stalk Iraq elections |work=BBC News |date=20 April 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22215632 |access-date=22 September 2019}}</ref> Though he is a [[Shi'a]], he is a non-sectarian and has said "It doesn't make a difference if you are [[Sunni]] or [[Shi'ite]] or Christian. I don't differentiate between anyone." He has been called Iraq's most popular politician.{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}

In 2013, ''[[The New York Times]]'' praised Dawai's governance, stating that "roads are being paved, new sewage systems installed and residents now enjoy electricity for up to 22 hours a day, far more than in [[Baghdad]]."<ref>{{cite news|last=Arango|first=Tim|title=A Sadrist Governor Is a Folk Hero to Iraqis|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/world/middleeast/a-sadrist-governor-is-a-folk-hero-to-iraqis.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0&ref=global-home|access-date=4 May 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=3 May 2013}}</ref>
