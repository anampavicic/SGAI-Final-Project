The republic has a reputation for an extreme and severe climate, with the second lowest temperatures in the [[Northern Hemisphere]] being recorded in [[Verkhoyansk]] and [[Oymyakon]] (second only to [[Summit Camp]], [[Greenland]]), and regular winter averages commonly dipping below {{convert|-35|C|F}} in Yakutsk. The hypercontinental tendencies also result in warm summers for much of the republic.

Sakha was first home to [[hunting-gathering]] and [[reindeer herding]] [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] and [[Paleosiberian peoples]] such as the [[Evenks]] and [[Yukaghir]]. Migrating from the area around [[Lake Baikal]], the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Sakha people]] first settled along the middle [[Lena river]] sometime between the 9th and 16th centuries, likely in several waves, bringing the [[pastoralism|pastoral]] economic system of [[Central Asia]] with them. 

The [[Russians]] colonised and incorporated the area as the [[Yakutsk Oblast]] into the [[Tsardom of Russia]] in the early-mid 17th century, obliging the indigenous peoples of the area to pay [[yasak|fur tribute]]. While the initial period following the Russian conquest saw the Sakha population drop by 70%, the [[Russian Empire|Imperial period]] also saw the expansion of the native [[Yakuts]] from the middle Lena along the [[Vilyuy River]] to the north and the east displacing other indigenous groups. Yakutia saw some of the last battles of the [[Russian Civil War]], and the Bolshevik authorities re-organized Yakutsk Oblast into the autonomous [[Yakut ASSR]] in 1922. The Soviet era saw the migration of many [[Slavs]], specifically [[Russians]] and [[Ukrainians]], into the area.

On 27 September 1990, the area became the Yakutskaya-Sakha Soviet Socialist Republic, and on 27 December 1991, it became the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia).

==Etymology==
The [[exonym]] ''Yakut'' comes from the [[Evenks|Evenk]] term ''Yako'' (also ''yoqo'', ''ñoqa'', or ''ñoka''), which was the term the Evenks used to describe the Sakha. This was in turn picked up by the Russians.<ref>{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=James |date=1992 |title=A History of the Peoples of Siberia: Russia's North Asian Colony |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=55 |isbn=978-0521477710}}</ref> The [[Yukaghirs]], another neighboring people in [[Siberia]], use the exonym ''yoqol'' ~ ''yoqod-'' ~ ''yoqon-'' ([[Tundra Yukaghir language|Tundra Yukaghir]]) or ''yaqal ~ yaqad- ~ yaqan-'' ([[Southern Yukaghir language|Kolyma Yukaghir]]). {{Citation needed|reason=Possible conjecture, no citation given|date=June 2021}}

The [[Endonym|self-designation]] ''Sakha'' is probably of the same origin (*''jaqa'' > ''Sakha'' following regular sound changes in the course of development of the Yakut language) as the Evenk and Yukaghir exonyms for the Yakuts.<ref name="Johanson">{{cite book | first=Lars | last=Johanson | title=Turkic | publisher=Cambridge University Press | location=Cambridge | year=2021 | page=89}}</ref> It is pronounced as ''Haka'' by the [[Dolgans]], [[Dolgan language|whose language]] is a close relative of the [[Yakut language]].<ref name = "Krivonogov2013">Victor P.

==Geography==
[[File:Sakha Republic Fauna.jpg|thumb|Fauna of the Sakha Republic: [[Ross's gull]], the [[Siberian crane]], [[polar bear]], [[horse]] and [[reindeer]]. Russian post miniature sheet, 2006.]]
* ''Borders'':
** ''internal'': [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug]] (660&nbsp;km) (East and Northeast), [[Magadan Oblast]] (1520&nbsp;km) (East), [[Khabarovsk Krai]] (2130&nbsp;km) (Southeast), [[Amur Oblast]] (South), [[Zabaykalsky Krai]] (South), [[Irkutsk Oblast]] (South and Southwest), [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] (West).
** ''water'': [[Arctic Ocean]] (including [[Laptev Sea]] and [[Eastern Siberian Sea]]) (North).
* ''Highest point'': [[Peak Pobeda, Sakha|Peak Pobeda]] (3,003&nbsp;m), [[Mus-Khaya Mountain]] Peak (2959&nbsp;m or 3,011&nbsp;m)

<!--*''Average elevation'':-->
Sakha stretches to the [[Henrietta Island]] in the far north and is washed by the [[Laptev Sea|Laptev]] and [[Eastern Siberian Sea]]s of the Arctic Ocean. These waters, the coldest and iciest of all seas in the Northern Hemisphere, are covered by ice for 9–10&nbsp;months of the year. [[New Siberian Islands]] are a part of the republic's territory. After [[Nunavut]] was separated from Canada's [[Northwest Territories]] in 1999, Sakha became the [[List of the largest country subdivisions by area|largest subnational entity]] ([[statoid]]) in the world, with an area of {{convert|3083523|km2|sp=us}},<ref name="area7" /> slightly smaller than the territory of [[India]] (3.3&nbsp;million km<sup>2</sup>), but still slightly larger than [[Argentina]].

Sakha can be divided into three great vegetation belts. About 40% of Sakha lies above the [[Arctic Circle]] and all of it is covered by [[permafrost]] which greatly influences the region's ecology and limits forests in the southern region. Arctic and subarctic [[tundra]] define the middle region, where [[lichen]] and [[moss]] grow as great green carpets and are favorite pastures for [[reindeer]]. In the southern part of the tundra belt, scattered stands of dwarf [[Siberian pine]] and [[larch]] grow along the rivers. Below the tundra is the vast [[taiga]] forest region. Larch trees dominate in the north and stands of [[fir]] and [[pine tree|pine]] begin to appear in the south. Taiga forests cover about 47% of Sakha and almost 90% of the cover is larch.

The Sakha Republic is the site of [[Pleistocene Park]], a project directed at recreating Pleistocene tundra grasslands by stimulating the growth of grass with the introduction of animals which thrived in the region during the late [[Pleistocene]]&nbsp;– early [[Holocene]] period.

Sakha produces 99% of all Russian diamonds and over 25% of the diamonds mined in the world.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Yakovleva|first1=Natalia P.|title=Natural resource use in the Russian North: a case study of diamond mining in the Republic of Sakha|journal=Environmental Management and Health|date=2000|volume=11|issue=4|pages=318–336|doi=10.1108/09566160010372743}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Bohlen|first1=Celestine|title=Poor Region in Russia Lays Claim to Its Diamonds|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/11/01/world/poor-region-in-russia-lays-claim-to-its-diamonds.html|access-date=18 March 2018|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1992}}</ref>

===Climate===
Sakha is known for its [[climate]] extremes, with the [[Verkhoyansk Range]] being the coldest area in the Northern Hemisphere. Some of the lowest natural temperatures ever recorded have been here. The [[Northern Hemisphere]]'s [[Pole of Cold]] is at [[Verkhoyansk]], where the temperatures reached as low as {{convert|−67.8|C}} in 1892 and 1885, and at [[Oymyakon]], where the temperatures reached as low as {{convert|−67.8|C}} in February 1934.

===Pre-history===
[[File:Yukaghirs.jpg|thumb|The people of the Ymyyakhtakh culture are regarded to be the ancestors of the modern [[Yukaghir people|Yukaghirs]].]]

[[Ymyakhtakh culture]] ({{Circa|2200}}–1300 BC) was a Late Neolithic culture of Siberia, with a very large archaeological horizon. Its origins were in Sakha, in the [[Lena river]] basin. From there it spread both to the east and to the west.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Kicki Näslund |url=https://www.academia.edu/10336011 |title=Short summary of Siberian pre-history and cultures |website=Academia.edu}}</ref>

===Early history===
The [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] [[Yakuts|Sakha people]] or ''Yakuts'' may have settled the area as early as the 9th century or as late as the 16th century, though most likely there were several migrations. They migrated up north from around [[Lake Baikal]] to the [[Lena River|middle Lena]] due to pressure by the Buryats, a Mongolic group.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jordan |first1=Bella Bychkova |last2=Jordan-Bychkov |first2=Terry G. |date=2000 |title=Siberian Village: Land and Life in the Sakha Republic |publisher=University Of Minnesota Press |page=38 |isbn=978-0816635696}}</ref>

The Sakha displaced earlier, much smaller populations who lived on hunting and reindeer herding, introducing the [[pastoralism|pastoralist]] economy of Central Asia. The indigenous populations of [[Paleosiberian languages|Paleosiberian]] and [[Tungusic peoples|Tungusic]] stock
were mostly [[Cultural assimilation|assimilated]] to the Sakha by the 17th century.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/resources/rfn/sakha.html |title=Scott Polar Research Institute — Republic of Sakha|publisher=Spri.cam.ac.uk|access-date=February 25, 2014}}</ref>

===Russian conquest===
{{Main|Russian conquest of Siberia}}

The [[Tsardom of Russia]] began its conquest of the region in the 17th century, moving east after the defeat of the [[Khanate of Sibir]]. [[Tygyn Darkhan|Tygyn]], a king of the [[Khangalassky District|Khangalassky]] Sakha, granted territory for Russian settlement in return for a military pact that included war against indigenous rebels of all North Eastern Asia ([[Magadan]], [[Chukotka Autonomous Okrug|Chukotka]], [[Kamchatka]] and [[Sakhalin]]). Kull, a king of the [[Megino-Kangalassky District|Megino-Khangalassky]] Sakha, began a Sakha conspiracy by allowing the first stockade construction.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}
[[File:Map of Yakut oblast.jpg|thumb|right|1821 map of Yakutsk Oblast.]]

In August 1638, the Moscow Government formed a new administrative unit with the administrative center of Lensky Ostrog (Fort Lensky), the future city of [[Yakutsk]], which had been founded by [[Pyotr Beketov]] in 1632.

The arrival of Russian settlers at the remote [[Russkoye Ustye]] in the [[Indigirka]] delta is also believed to date from the 17th century.<ref>A. I. Gogolev, "История Якутии: (Обзор исторических событий до начала ХХ в.)" ([http://www.ysu.ru/facultet/kfi/books/HistoryOfYakutiya.htm History of Yakutia: Review of Historical Events to the beginning of the 20th century] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050527010736/http://www.ysu.ru/facultet/kfi/books/HistoryOfYakutiya.htm |date=May 27, 2005 }}) Yakutsk, 1999.</ref> The [[Siberian Governorate]] was established as part of the Russian Empire in 1708.

Russian settlers began to form a community in the 18th century, which adopted certain Sakha customs and was often called ''Yakutyane'' (Якутя́не) or Lena Early Settlers (ленские старожилы). However, the influx of later settlers had assimilated themselves into the Russian mainstream by the 20th century.

===Russian Empire===
In an administrative reform of 1782, [[Irkutsk Governorate]] was created. In 1805, [[Yakutsk Oblast]] was split from Irkutsk Governorate.<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle= Yakutsk (province) | volume= 28 |last1= Kropotkin |first1= Peter Alexeivitch |author1-link=Peter Kropotkin|last2= Bealby |first2=John Thomas|pages = 898&ndash;899 |short= 1}}</ref>

Yakutsk Oblast in the early 19th century marked the easternmost territory of the Russian Empire, including such [[Russian Far East|Far Eastern]] (Pacific) territories as were acquired, known as Okhotsk Okrug within Yakutsk Oblast. With the formation of [[Primorskaya Oblast]] in 1856, the Russian territories of the Pacific were detached from Sakha.

[[File:Члены Сибирской областной Думы 1917.jpeg|thumb|right|Members of the Siberian Regional Duma from Yakutsk, 1917.]]
The Russians established agriculture in the [[Lena River]] basin. The members of religious groups who were exiled to Sakha in the second half of the 19th century began to grow [[wheat]], [[oat]]s, and [[potato]]es. The [[fur trade]] established a cash economy. Industry and transport began to develop at the end of the 19th century and in the beginning of the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period. This was also the beginning of [[geological]] prospecting, [[mining]], and local [[lead]] production. The first steam-powered ships and barges arrived.

Sakha's remoteness, compared to the rest of Siberia, made it a place of exile of choice for both Tsarist and Communist governments of Russia. Among the famous Tsarist-era exiles were the democratic writer [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]]; [[Doukhobor]]s, [[conscientious objector]]s whose story was told to [[Leo Tolstoy]] by [[Vasily Nikolaevich Pozdnyakov|Vasily Pozdnyakov]]; the [[Socialist Revolutionary Party]] member and writer [[Vladimir Zenzinov]], who left an account of his Arctic experiences; and Polish socialist activist [[Wacław Sieroszewski]], who pioneered in ethnographic research on the Sakha people.

A Sakha national movement first emerged during the [[1905 Revolution]]. A Yakut Union was formed under the leadership of a Sakha lawyer and city councilor by the name of Vasily Nikiforov, which criticized the policies and effects of Russian colonialism, and demanded representation in the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|State Duma]]. The Yakut Union acted to make the city council of Yakutsk stand down and was joined by thousands of Sakha from the countryside, but the leaders were arrested and the movement fizzled out by April 1906. Their demand for a Sakha representative in the Duma, however, was granted.<ref>{{cite book |last=Forsyth |first=James |date=1992 |title=A History of the Peoples of Siberia: Russia's North Asian Colony |publisher=Cambridge University Press |pages=167–168 |isbn=978-0521477710}}</ref>

===Soviet era===
Sakha was home to the last stage of the Russian Civil War, the [[Yakut Revolt]]. On April 27, 1922, former Yakutsk Oblast was proclaimed the [[Yakut Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Yakut ASSR]], although in fact the eastern part of the territory, including the city of Yakutsk, was controlled by the [[White movement|White Russians]].
[[File:Platon Oyunsky 1921.jpeg|left|thumb|217x217px|Platon Oyunsky, who wrote the traditionally-oral [[olonkho]] epics.]]
The early Soviet period saw a flourishing of Sakha literature as men such as [[Platon Oyunsky]] wrote down in writing the traditionally oral and improvised [[olonkho]], in addition to composing their own works. Many early Sakha leaders, including Oyunsky, died in the [[Great Purge]].
[[File:MapYakut-1928-1323.jpg|alt=Map of the Autonomous Yakut SSR, 1928|thumb|Map of the Autonomous Yakut SSR, 1928]]
Sakha experienced significant collectivization [[first five-year plan|between 1929 and 1934]], with the number of households experiencing collectivization rising from 3.6% in 1929 to 41.7% in 1932. Policies by which the Sakha were harshly affected resulted in the population dropping from 240,500 in 1926 down to 236,700 at the 1959 census.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jordan |first1=Bella Bychkova |last2=Jordan-Bychkov |first2=Terry G. |date=2000 |title=Siberian Village: Land and Life in the Sakha Republic |publisher=University Of Minnesota Press |pages=64–65 |isbn=978-0816635696}}</ref>

Sakha's demographics shifted wildly during the Soviet period as ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, among other groups, settled the area en masse, primarily in Yakutsk and the industrial south. Previously, even Yakutsk had been primarily Sakha and Sakha-speaking. With the end of [[korenizatsiya]], usage of the Sakha language was restricted in urban areas such as Yakutsk, which became primarily Russian-speaking.

===Post-Soviet era===
In 1992, after the [[fall of the Soviet Union]], Sakha was recognized in Moscow as the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic under the jurisdiction of the Russian Federation. Sakha is historically part of Russian Siberia, but since the formation of the [[Far Eastern Federal District]] in 2000, it is administratively part of the [[Russian Far East]].

===Languages===
The official languages are both Russian and [[Sakha language|Sakha]], also known as Yakut, which is spoken by roughly half of the republic's population. In the 2021 census, 95% of Yakuts, 72% of Evenks and 60% of Evens declared Sakha as their native language.<ref name=languages2021>{{cite web|title=Население наиболее многочисленных национальностей по родному языку|url=https://rosstat.gov.ru/storage/mediabank/Tom5_tab1_VPN-2020.xlsx|publisher=[[Federal State Statistics Service (Russia)|Federal State Statistics Service]]|accessdate=30 December 2022}}</ref> The Sakha language is a member of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] language family, belonging to the Siberian branch. It is closely related to the [[Dolgan language|Dolgan]] language of the former [[Taymyr Autonomous Okrug|Taymyr Dolgano-Nenets Autonomous Okrug]].

The Sakha Republic is also home to many of the world's speakers of [[Tungusic languages]], primarily of [[Evenki language|Evenki]] and [[Even language|Even]]. Additionally, [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] and the lects of the [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]] language family are spoken in the northeast.

Before the arrival of the Russian Empire, the majority of the local population was [[Tengrist]], similar to the other Turkic people of Central Asia, or in Paleoasian indigenous [[shamanism]] with both 'light' (community leading) and 'dark' (healing through spirit journey) shamans. Under the Russians, the local population was converted to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and required to take Orthodox Christian names, but in practice generally continued to follow traditional religions. During the Soviet era, most or all of the shamans died without successors.
In the 1990s, a neopagan shamanist movement called ''aiyy yeurekhé'' was founded by the controversial journalist Ivan Ukhkhan and a philologist calling himself Téris.<ref>[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/28-1_113.pdf Yakutia (Sakha) Faces a Religious Choice: Shamanism or Christianity]</ref> This group and others cooperated to build a shaman temple in downtown Yakutsk in 2002.<ref>[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/pdf/rss/33-1_057.pdf Whose Steeple is Higher? Religious Competition in Siberia]</ref>

Currently,{{when|date=March 2023}} while Orthodox Christianity maintains a following (however, with very few priests willing to be stationed outside of Yakutsk), there is interest and activity toward renewing the traditional religions. As of 2008, Orthodox leaders described the worldview of the republic's indigenous population (or, rather, those among the population who are not completely indifferent to religion) as ''dvoyeverie'' (dual belief system), or a "tendency toward [[syncretism]]", as evidenced by the locals sometimes first inviting a shaman, and then an Orthodox priest to carry out their rites in connection with some event in their life.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.taday.ru/text/135461.html

|quote=Во многих случаях нам говорили, что при совершении тех или иных обрядов или просто действий приглашают сначала шамана, потом священника. Правда, именно в таком порядке, признавая христианство чем-то высшим по отношению к местной магической языческой традиции, но это соединяя. Даже среди тех представителей якутской интеллигенции, с которыми мы общались, это стремление к синкретизму было отчетливо приметно.

According to the Information Center under the President of Sakha Republic (Информационный центр при Президенте РС(Я)), the religious demography of the republic was as follows:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religare.ru/2_43720.html |title=РЕЛИГАРЕ – Современная религиозная ситуация в Республике Саха (Якутия): проблемы и перспективы |publisher=Religare.ru |access-date=February 25, 2014}}</ref> Orthodoxy: 44.9%, Shamanism: 26.2%, Non-religious: 23.0%, New religious movements: 2.4%, Islam: 1.2%, Buddhism: 1.0%, Protestantism: 0.9%, Catholicism: 0.4%.

According to a 2012 survey,<ref name="2012ArenaAtlas"/> 37.8% of the population of Sakha adheres to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], 13% to [[Tengrism]] or Sakha [[Siberian shamanism|shamanism]], 2% to [[Islam]], 1% are unaffiliated [[Christians]], 1% to forms of [[Protestantism]], and 0.4% to [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. In addition, 26% of the population deems itself [[atheism|atheist]], 17% is "spiritual but not religious", and 1.8% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.<ref name="2012ArenaAtlas"/>

The supreme legislative body of state authority in Sakha is a unicameral State Assembly known as the ''Il Tumen''.  The government of the Sakha (Yakutia) Republic is the executive body of state authority.

The republic fosters close cultural, political, economic, and industrial relations with the independent Turkic states through membership in organizations such as the [[Turkic Council]] and the [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&newsId=259275&link=259275|title=Turkey seeks to institutionalize relations with Turkic republics – Today's Zaman, your gateway to Turkish daily news|publisher=Todayszaman.com|date=October 9, 2011|access-date=February 25, 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014233821/http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?load=detay&newsId=259275&link=259275|archive-date=October 14, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.turkishweekly.net/columnist/3540/turkey-and-the-turkic-republics-is-there-a-new-vision-.html |title=Turkey and the Turkic Republics: Is There a New Vision? |access-date=May 10, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103034927/http://www.turkishweekly.net/columnist/3540/turkey-and-the-turkic-republics-is-there-a-new-vision-.html |archive-date=January 3, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yakutiatoday.com/region/foreign.shtml |title=Foreign Relations of the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) |publisher=YakutiaToday.Com |date=January 1, 2008|access-date=February 25, 2014}}</ref>

===Transportation===
Water transport ranks first for cargo turnover. There are six river ports, two seaports ([[Tiksi]] and Zelyony Mys). Four shipping companies, including the Arctic Sea Shipping Company, operate in the republic. The republic's main waterway is the [[Lena River]], which links [[Yakutsk]] with the rail station of [[Ust-Kut]] in [[Irkutsk Oblast]].

[[File:Aeroport Yakutsk 01.jpg|thumb|[[Yakutsk Airport|Yakutsk Aeroport]], the main air-traffic hub of the republic.]]

Air transport is the most important for transporting people. Airlines connect the republic with most regions of Russia. [[Yakutsk Airport]] has an international terminal.

Two federal roads pass the republic. They are Yakutsk–[[Skovorodino, Amur Oblast|Skovorodino]] ([[A360 Lena highway (Russia)|A360 Lena highway]]) and Yakutsk–[[Magadan]] ([[M56 Kolyma Highway]]).
However, due to the presence of permafrost, use of asphalt is not practical, and therefore the roads are made of clay.  When heavy rains blow over the region, the roads often turn to mud, sometimes stranding hundreds of travelers in the process.<ref>EnglishRussia.com – [http://englishrussia.com/?p=315 ''Russian Roads'']</ref>

The [[Berkakit]]–[[Tommot]] railroad is currently in operation. It links the [[Baikal-Amur Mainline]] with the industrial centers in South Sakha. Construction of the [[Amur–Yakutsk Mainline]] continues northward; the railway was completed to [[Nizhny Bestyakh]], across the river from Yakutsk, in 2013. Though this one-track railroad from Tommot to Nizhny Bestyakh is under temporary operation (30% of its full capacity), the federal agency for railways declared that this railroad would be in full operation in fall 2015.{{update inline|date=February 2016}} Also the private company is now{{when|date=February 2016}} constructing the transport and logistics center in Nizhny Bestyakh.

==Media==

The Yakuts have fully preserved their native language, which differs significantly from other Turkic languages by the presence of a layer of unique Paleo-Asiatic vocabulary. The Yakut language has a developed literary tradition with many styles and genres, and the ancient Sakha epic Olonkho is recognized by UNESCO as a masterpiece of the oral and intangible heritage of humanity.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/RL/olonkho-yakut-heroic-epos-00145 |title=Olonkho, Yakut heroic epos}}</ref>
