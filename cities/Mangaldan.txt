'''Mangaldan''', officially the '''Municipality of Mangaldan''' ({{langx|pag|Baley na Mangaldan}}; {{langx|ilo|Ili ti Mangaldan}}; {{langx|tl|Bayan ng Mangaldan}}), is a 1st class [[municipality of the Philippines|municipality]] in the [[Philippine Province|province]] of [[Pangasinan]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 113,185 people.{{PH census|current}}

== Etymology ==
There are four conflicting origins of the name Mangaldan:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mangaldan.gov.ph/about.php|title=A Glimpse in History|website=Official Website of the Municipality of Mangaldan|accessdate=July 20, 2024}}</ref>
* The first theory suggests that a Spanish missionary asked locals for the name of the settlement. A local, misinterpreting the request as a query for water, responded with “manga-alay-adan,” which translates to “Adan is fetching.”
* The second theory implies that Mangaldan got its name from its first native chief Babaldan.
* The third theory posits that the town's name originated from the term “man-nga-ngal-ngalan,” which means “quarrel” in the local dialect. This name emerged from a custom where townspeople were free to gather [[mango]]es from a large tree in the town center, leading to disputes as the fruit became scarce.
* According to Fr. Raymundo Suarez, OP, in his manuscript ''Apuntes Curiosos de Pangasinan'', Mangaldan is derived from "alar" or "alad", meaning [[bamboo]] fence, which existed in the place. Either term is combined with "mang" and "an," and the penultimate "A" is dropped, resulting in "Mangaldan."

== History ==
Mangaldan owns the distinction as the third town in [[Pangasinan]] to be founded by the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] missionaries. As early as 1591, Mangaldan already existed as a Spanish [[encomienda]]. Its foundation as a town is attributed to Juan Martinez de Santo Domingo, a former missionary of [[Pangasinan]] who died in [[Japan]] on March 19, 1618.

Mangaldan started as a "visita" of [[Calasiao]] and it remained as such until the Dominicans created it as an independent vicariate under the patronage of Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] on June 2, 1600.

It is said that of all the people of Pangasinan, the Mangaldanians were the most difficult to convert. The greatest enemy of the missionaries in the town was a certain man named Casipit who tried to force them out of the town and even attempted to kill some of them. Yet, when he was converted by the first apostle, Fr. Pedro Soto, he became the principal propagator of the Faith. He contributed a great sum of money for the construction of the first church.

In the second half of the 19th century, Mangaldan was the richest town in the province. This was due to the famous irrigation system which the missionaries built within the confines of the town<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://capitalpangasinan.blogspot.com/2008/02/mangaldan-church.html|title = Capital of Pangasinan: Mangaldan Church|date = 18 February 2008}}</ref> causing its fertile fields to yield bountiful harvest of palay. Most outstanding in this gigantic task was Fr. Jose Torres who gave his life to bring it to completion in 1892.

The third church to be built in Mangaldan was completed in 1812 by Fr. Lorenzo Martin. It collapsed during the great earthquake of 16 March 1892, together with the big chapel in the cemetery. The construction of the convent dates back in 1747. The construction of the sixth and present church of Mangaldan was begun in 1942 by Fr. Juan Sison, and was completed 20 years later by Fr. Leon Bitanga.

During [[World War II]], Mangaldan had an airstrip that was used by the [[American military]].
