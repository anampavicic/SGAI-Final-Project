'''Honiara''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|h|oʊ|n|i|ˈ|ɑːr|ə}}) is the capital and largest city of [[Solomon Islands]], situated on the northwestern coast of [[Guadalcanal]]. {{As of|2021}}, it had a population of 92,344 people. The city is served by [[Honiara International Airport]] and the seaport of [[Point Cruz]], and lies along the Kukum Highway. In 1983, a [[Capital districts and territories|capital territory]] – comprising the 22 square-kilometre metropolitan area of Honiara – was proclaimed, with a self-governing status akin to a [[Provinces of Solomon Islands|province]], although the city also retained an older role as capital of [[Guadalcanal Province]].

The airport area to the east of Honiara was the site of a battle between the United States and the Japanese during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] in [[World War II]], the [[Battle of Henderson Field]] of 1942, from which the former emerged victorious. After Honiara became the new administrative centre of the [[British Solomon Islands Protectorate]] in 1952 with the addition of many administrative buildings, the town began to develop and grow in population. Since the late 1990s, Honiara has suffered a turbulent history of ethnic violence and political unrest and is scarred by rioting. A coup attempt in June 2000 resulted in violent rebellions and fighting between the ethnic Malaitans of the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (MEF) and the Guadalcanal natives of the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (IFM).

Although a peace agreement was made in October 2000, violence ensued in the city streets in March 2002 when two diplomats from [[New Zealand]] and several others were murdered. In July 2003, conditions had become so bad in Honiara that the [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands]] (RAMSI), consisting of multiple Pacific nations under Australian leadership, was invited into the country by the Solomons Government to restore order. In 2006, [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands#Riots following 2006 general election|riots]] broke out following the election of [[Snyder Rini]] as Prime Minister, destroying a part of Chinatown and making more than 1,000 Chinese residents homeless. The riots devastated the town and tourism in the city and the islands was severely affected.

Honiara contains the majority of the major government buildings and institutions of Solomon Islands. The [[National Parliament of Solomon Islands]], [[Honiara Solomon Islands College of Higher Education]], [[International School in Honiara]] and [[University of the South Pacific Solomon Islands]] are located in Honiara as is the national museum and Honiara Market. Politically Honiara is divided into three [[Constituencies in Solomon Islands|parliamentary constituencies]], electing 3 of the 50 members of the [[National Parliament of Solomon Islands|National Parliament]]. These constituencies, East Honiara, Central Honiara and West Honiara, are three of only six constituencies in the country to have an electorate of over 10,000 people.

Honiara is predominantly Christian and is served by the headquarters of the [[Church of the Province of Melanesia]] ([[Anglican]]), the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Honiara]], the [[South Seas Evangelical Church]], the [[United Church in Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands|United Church]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] and other Christian churches.

== Population ==
As of the 2021 [[census]], Honiara's population is 92,344.<ref>Solomon Islands National Statistics Office. Projected population by province 2010-2025. https://www.statistics.gov.sb/statistics/social-statistics/population {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220630191359/https://statistics.gov.sb/statistics/social-statistics/population |date=30 June 2022 }}</ref> This makes Honiara the most populous city in [[Solomon Islands]].

==History==
The name Honiara derives from ''nagho ni ara'' which roughly translates as "place of the east wind" or "facing the southeast wind" in one of the Guadalcanal languages.{{Sfn|Room|2006|p=168}} The town has not been extensively documented and little detailed material exists on it.{{Sfn|Kupiainen|2000|pp=128–134}}

===World War II===
[[File:Aerial view of Henderson Field, Guadalcanal, in late August 1942.jpg|thumb|left|Henderson Field on [[Guadalcanal]] in late August 1942, soon after Allied aircraft began operating out of the airfield]]
The [[Battle of Henderson Field]] (1942), the last of the three major land offensives conducted by the Japanese during the [[Guadalcanal Campaign]] of [[World War II]] took place in what is now the airport area about {{convert|11|km}} to the east of the city centre.

===Modern development===
Honiara officially became the capital of the British Protectorate of Solomon Islands in 1952. The infrastructure had been well developed by the US during the war which dictated the decision of the [[British Government]] to shift the capital to Honiara.{{Sfn|Stanley|2004|p=970}}{{Sfn|McKinnon|Carillet|Starnes|2008|p=258}} Government buildings opened in Honiara from early January in 1952. [[Robert Christopher Stafford Stanley|Sir Robert Stanley]] was based at Honiara during his time as [[High Commissioner for the Western Pacific]], which included the British Solomon Islands, the Condominium of [[New Hebrides]] (now [[Vanuatu]]) and the [[Gilbert and Ellice Islands]] colony (now [[Kiribati]] and [[Tuvalu]]).{{Sfn|Gina|2003|p=48}} Macu Salato arrived in Honiara in early August 1954 and was based in the town, conducting surveys all across the islands and investigating [[leprosy]].{{Sfn|Kiste|1998|p=26}} He departed and returned to Fiji in late March 1955.{{Sfn|Kiste|1998|p=26}} 
[[File:Honiara aerial crop.jpg|thumb|right|Honiara from the east]]
The town grew after Honiara became the capital city, receiving two-thirds of the allocations granted for the country's economic development in the 1960s and 1970s, resulting in substantial infrastructure development. Population growth was very slow and only about 5% of Solomon Islanders were living in the city. However, the [[Bellona Island|Bellonese]] population significantly increased; they established permanent and semi-permanent houses in the Honiara vicinity, typically along the banks of the White River.{{Sfn|Kupiainen|2000|pp=128–134}}  The town was affected by [[creolisation]].{{Sfn|Selbach|Cardoso|Van Den Berg|2009|p=51}} In the 1960s, [[Pijin]] became its principal language, and the mother tongue of a generation of young urban adults and children.{{Sfn|Kortmann|Schneider|2004|p=692}} Through Honiara the language spread and has since become the main language spoken in the islands.{{Sfn|Kortmann|Schneider|2004|p=692}}

[[Rhys Richards]], a New Zealand historian and former New Zealand High Commissioner of Solomon Islands, spent many years in Honiara.{{Sfn|Treadaway|2007|p=10}} In 1979 Honiara was still a small town in terms of population, especially for a capital city, with 18,346 people, of which 10,870 were men, and 7,476 were women.{{Sfn|Lemps|1984|p=66}} In July 1978, Honiara became the new capital of the independent Solomon Islands.{{Sfn|Stanley|2004|p=970}}

===Conflict===
An International Express Mail Agreement and regulations were signed between the United States and Solomon Islands governments in Honiara and Washington, D.C. on 19 April and 27 June 1991, coming into effect on 1 August 1991.{{Sfn|States|2007|p=244}} On 6 November 1998, a peace agreement was signed in Honiara between the United States and Solomon Islands governments.{{Sfn|States|2007|p=244}} However, since the late 1990s, Honiara has been the centre of ethnic violence and political unrest in the country.{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}} The area around Honiara was the battle ground of rival factions during the unrest as a result of the dominance of Malaitans, who were outsiders, and the local Guadalcanal islanders.{{Sfn|McKinnon|Carillet|Starnes|2008|p=258}}
A coup attempt occurred in June 2000 which resulted in violent rebellions and fighting between the [[Malaita Eagle Force]] (MEF) and the Guadalcanal natives of the [[Isatabu Freedom Movement]] (IFM). Violence was prevalent in the streets of Honiara, and although a peace agreement was made in October 2000, violence ensued in March 2002 when two diplomats from [[New Zealand]] and several others were murdered.{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}} Conditions became so bad in Honiara that in July 2003 Australian military and police units moved into the country to suppress the conflict, increase security, rebuild the damaged city and safeguard its shattered economic, political and legal institutions.{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}}

In 2006, [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands#Riots following 2006 general election|riots]] broke out following the election of [[Snyder Rini]] as Prime Minister, destroying part of Chinatown and displacing more than 1,000 Chinese residents; the large Pacific Casino Hotel was also totally gutted.<ref name=McKinnon2009>{{cite news|author=Spiller, Penny|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4930994.stm|title=Riots highlight Chinese tensions|work=BBC News|date=21 April 2006|access-date=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202134436/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4930994.stm|archive-date=2 December 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> The commercial heart of Honiara was virtually reduced to rubble and ashes.{{Sfn|Huisken|Thatcher|2007|p=92}} Three [[National Parliament of the Solomon Islands|National Parliament]] members, [[Charles Dausabea]], [[Nelson Ne'e]], and [[Patrick Vahoe]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/third-solomons-mp-arrested-over-riot/2006/04/24/1145730850134.html?page=2|title=Third Solomons MP arrested over riot|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=24 April 2006|access-date=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104151646/http://www.smh.com.au/news/world/third-solomons-mp-arrested-over-riot/2006/04/24/1145730850134.html?page=2|archive-date=4 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> were arrested during or as a result of the riots. The Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), the 16-country Pacific Islands Forum initiative set up in 2003 with assistance from Australia, intervened, sending in additional police and army officers to bring the situation under control. A vote of no confidence was passed against the Prime Minister. Following his resignation, a five-party Grand Coalition for Change Government was formed in May 2006, with [[Manasseh Sogavare]] as Prime Minister, quelling the riots and running the government. The army part of [[Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands|RAMSI]] was removed and rebuilding took shape.<ref name=Doing>{{cite web|url=http://www.pitic.org.au/pdfs/bigs/solomons.pdf |title=Doing Business in the Solomon Islands |access-date=24 September 2012 |publisher=pitic.org.au |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120410143719/http://www.pitic.org.au/pdfs/bigs/solomons.pdf |archive-date=10 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

In [[2021 Solomon Islands unrest|2021, Honiara saw mass unrest]]; the [[Solomon Islands Parliament Building]] was attacked, and [[Chinatown, Honiara|Chinatown]] was looted and burned.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Wayne Chang and Jonny Hallam|title=3 burned bodies found in Solomon Islands' Chinatown following protests|url=https://www.cnn.com/2021/11/26/asia/solomon-islands-protest-fourth-day-intl-hnk/index.html|access-date=2021-11-27|website=CNN|date=27 November 2021 }}</ref>

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Solomon Islands-CIA WFB Map.png|right|thumb|Location of Honiara]]
Honiara is located on the northwestern coast of the island of [[Guadalcanal]] and includes a seaport at [[Point Cruz]]. The [[Matanikau River]] flows through the town, past Chinatown, badly affected by the 2006 riot. The town revolves around the Kukum Highway, which connects it with the [[Honiara International Airport]] (formerly known as [[Henderson Field (Guadalcanal)|Henderson Field]]) about {{convert|11|km}} to the east of Honiara across the [[Lunga River (Solomon Islands)|Lunga River]]. To the west of the town centre are the suburbs of [[White River, Honiara|White River]] and [[Tanaghai]].<ref name="GM">{{cite map|title= Maps|publisher=[[Google Maps]]}}</ref>

The climate is [[tropical climate|tropical]], more specifically a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Af]]), with an average daytime temperature of about {{Convert|28|C|F}}. Honiara is wetter between November and April. The average precipitation per year is about {{Convert|2000|mm|in}} and thus is lower than the average for Solomon Islands as a whole ({{Convert|3000|mm|in}}). Honiara is subject to [[monsoon]]s.{{Sfn|Govan|1995|p=96}} On 1 February 2010, Honiara recorded a temperature of {{convert|36.1|C|F|abbr=on}}, which is the highest temperature to have ever been recorded in Solomon Islands.<ref name="wu2010heatrecords">{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Jeff|title=Bolivia ties its all-time heat record|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1701|work=Weather Underground|publisher=Dr. Jeff Masters' WunderBlog|access-date=23 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124020718/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1701|archive-date=24 November 2010}}</ref>

==Politics==
[[File:Solomon Islands House of Parliament (inside).jpg|thumb|right|[[National Parliament of Solomon Islands]] in Honiara]]

Honiara is divided into three [[Constituencies in Solomon Islands|parliamentary constituencies]], electing three of the 50 Members of the [[National Parliament of Solomon Islands|National Parliament]]. These constituencies (East Honiara, Central Honiara and West Honiara) are three of only six constituencies in the country to have an electorate of over 10,000. East Honiara, with an electorate of 30,049 in 2006, is the only constituency in the country with more than 20,000 voters. Following the [[2019 Solomon Islands general election|2019 general election]], the city's representatives are:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.sb/index.php?q=node/149|title=Constituencies and their Members of Parliament|publisher=National Parliament of Solomon Islands|access-date=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030200657/http://www.parliament.gov.sb/index.php?q=node%2F149|archive-date=30 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.sb/index.php?q=node/147|title=Listing of Members of Parliament by Political Parties|publisher=National Parliament of Solomon Islands|access-date=22 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121030200644/http://www.parliament.gov.sb/index.php?q=node%2F147|archive-date=30 October 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Economy ==
[[File:Honiara.jpg|thumb|right|The main street of Honiara]]
Honiara developed economically at a much faster rate than other parts of Solomon Islands; during the 1960s and 1970s, some two-thirds of the investment into economic development in the country went into developing the infrastructure of Honiara, despite the fact that at the time only some five percent of Solomon Islanders lived there.{{Sfn|Bennett|1987|p=326}} Like [[Tulagi]], the town did not grow substantially as a result of industrialisation.{{Sfn|Sofield|2003|p=194}} As Trevor Sofield says, "The shops and businesses in these centres served the needs of the government officials and expatriate businessmen, planters, and traders. Honiara, like many other ex-colonial cities, still reflects the political, economic, and cultural structure of its former metropolitan mentor much more than it does the national traits of Solomon Islands society."{{Sfn|Sofield|2003|p=194}}
[[File:Aerial view of Honiara, 2013.jpg|thumb|left|View of Honiara]]
Honiara is Solomon Islands' springboard for tourism activities. The country's tourist office, Solomon Islands Visitors Bureau, is on Honiara's main thoroughfare, Mendana Avenue. Situated between the Yacht Club and the Solomon Kitano Mendana Hotel, its officers provide tourist information and can radio ahead to announce visitors' arrivals to guest houses in the remoter areas. Honiara banks include BSP Bank, the [[ANZ Bank]], BRED Bank and POB Bank.{{Sfn|Stanley|2004|p=}} Anchorage facilities are available in Honiara Port for both national and international ships.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sipa.com.sb/porthoniara.html|title=Honiara Port|access-date=15 August 2013|publisher=Solomon Islands Ports Authority (SIPA)|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140918220424/http://www.sipa.com.sb/porthoniara.html|archive-date=18 September 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>

The violence which had plagued Honiara and the islands since the late 1990s had a devastating impact on the economy due to the fact that many tourist organisations around the world warned tourists wishing to visit the islands to stay away, especially in 2002 and 2003 at the peak of the troubles.{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}} In 1998, the country earned around $13&nbsp;million from tourism and just $629,000 in 1999, equating to an average spend per visit of only US$254 (about US$35/day).{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}} In 1999, tourism in the city and nation accounted for just 4.38% of the total GDP.{{Sfn|Cooper|Hall|2005|p=253}}

==Landmarks==
As the capital of Solomon Islands, Honiara contains the majority of the major government buildings and institutions, including Honiara Lauru Land Conference, [[Honiara Solomon Islands College of Higher Education]], [[International School in Honiara]], [[University of the South Pacific Solomon Islands]], Honiara [[Solomon Islands Ports Authority]]. These centres are involved in marine research in Solomon Islands.<ref name="Hunnam2001">{{cite book|last=Hunnam|first=Peter|title=Marine resource management and conservation planning: Bismarck-Solomon Seas ecoregion : Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UhTbAAAAMAAJ|access-date=22 September 2012|year=2001|publisher=World Wide Fund for Nature|isbn=9789823580074|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130526080200/http://books.google.com/books?id=UhTbAAAAMAAJ|archive-date=26 May 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> The Dodo Creek Research Station of the Ministry of Agriculture and Lands is based in Honiara. {{Sfn|Elevitch|2006|p=240}} [[Honiara Central Market]] is the centre of trading activity in the islands and contains many market stalls selling a wide range of goods. East of the mouth of the Mataniko River is the beach where, in the shallow waters of the sea, wrecks of a Japanese ship destroyed on 23 October 1942 by American artillery and small arms can be seen. At the back of the beach there is a settlement called the Lord Howe Settlement, consisting of a large community of [[Polynesians]] from [[Ontong Java Atoll|Ongtong Java]] in the Western Provinces.{{Sfn| Stanley|2000|p=873}} Chinatown, with its high porches, is said to look like an "Asian Wild West".{{Sfn|Stanley|2000|p=873}}

Honiara Children's Park is a property of the Honiara Beautification Committee. The park, the only children's recreation area in Honiara, is located along the eastern coast of Honiara City as all other areas in the region are private property. According to a study, the park is in danger and needs to be protected as the coastline is subject to erosion; the erosion is recorded to be about {{Convert|6|-|8|m|ft}} between the old coastline and the eroded coastline. This erosion needs to be checked by building a retaining wall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usp.ac.fj/fileadmin/files/faculties/fste/geography/Earthcaching/students/Dalton/Dalton_Full_Report.pdf|title=Effects of rising sea levels at Children's Park – Honiara, Solomon Islands|date=12 November 2010|access-date=24 September 2012|publisher=usp.ac.fj|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181003105128/http://www.usp.ac.fj/fileadmin/files/faculties/fste/geography/Earthcaching/students/Dalton/Dalton_Full_Report.pdf|archive-date=3 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

===War memorial and peace park===
[[File:Guadalcanal American Memorial.jpg|thumb|left|Guadalcanal American Memorial]]
The [[Guadalcanal American Memorial]] is an attraction. It was built at the initiative of Robert F Reynolds, Chief of Valors Tours Ltd.{{sfn| Stanley|2004|p=98}} To mark the 50th anniversary of the Red Beach landings, the U.S. War Memorial was dedicated on 7 August 1992. An account of this is inscribed on red marble tablets inside the monument compound.{{sfn| Stanley|2000|p=873}}
The Solomons Peace Memorial Park, built by the Japanese war veterans in memory of all those who were killed in World War II, is about {{Convert|3.5|km|mi}} down the coastal road.{{Sfn|McKinnon|Carillet|Starnes|2008|p=258}} There are several other relics from World War II in and around Honiara, described by "[[Lonely Planet]]" as "spooky".{{Sfn|Planet|2010|p=365}} Also seen is the memorial erected in honour of Sergeant Major Jacob Vouza, a highly decorated war hero who escaped after the Japanese tortured him and lived to tell his story.{{Sfn|Stanley|2000|p=873}}

The [[Solomon Islands Parliament Building]], located on the hill above Hibiscus Avenue, built with American aid, is a concrete structure of conical-shape, which was inaugurated in 1993. The dome has tapestry, frescoes, and traditional artwork. The parliament building was built at a cost of US$5&nbsp;million in honour of the 450 U.S. soldiers and 1,200 Marines who died during the Guadalcanal operations during the war. Ironically the building was originally built by a Japanese firm.{{sfn| Stanley|2000|p=873}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/solomon-islands/guadalcanal/honiara/sights/government-building/national-parliament|title=The National Parliament|access-date=24 September 2012|publisher=Lonely Planet.com}}</ref>

===Museums===
The [http://sb.geoview.info/solomon_islands_national_museum,1958123286n National Museum], located opposite the Mendana Hotel, has exhibits of traditional handicrafts and historical artefacts, particularly exhibits on [[archaeology]], currencies, arms, languages, personal ornaments, traditional music and dance, agricultural implements, life and natural environs of the country, fishing tools and tackles, and many publications and handicrafts. The Cultural Centre of the museum has a display of eight traditional houses, built in 1981, from the nine provinces of Solomon Islands. The museum hosted the first Melanesian Arts and Crafts festival in 1998, and organises dances on the festival stage opposite the museum. There is also a {{Convert|155|mm|in}} Japanese howitzer on display between the museum and the police station, which is called "Pistol Pete". It was used for bombarding Henderson Field during the Guadalcanal fighting. On the opposite side of the police station is the Central Bank, which has a display of traditional currency. It also has Rennellese wood carvings and paintings.{{Sfn| Stanley|2000|p=873}} The Cultural Centre behind the museum has exhibits of traditional architectural styles. The National Art Gallery arranges painting exhibitions at the Old Government House, the former residence of the Governor General.

The Botanical Gardens of the National Art Gallery is popular for afternoon strolls, and is noted for its orchids and shrubs. It houses a [[herbarium]], a lily studded waterbody, walkways, and the Watapamu village, representing a typical village of the islands, which is named after the water pump located nearby.{{Sfn| Stanley|2000|p=873}} An Anthropology Museum is located in Honiara, which has exhibits of recent origin.

The [[Woodford International School]], also called the International School, was initiated in the mid-1950s with about a dozen students. It was expanded under Solomon Islands' National Development Plan in the 1970s with the aim to attract investment and expertise into the country. In 1979, following independence in 1978 from the British rule, with British aid, new school buildings were built. The school was known as Honiara International School in September 1989 and took the name of Woodford International School in the 1990s. It is now a fully recognised independent education authority, and the government of Solomon Islands is only involved in providing a grant to the school.<ref name=woodford/> Since 2007, the management has started a programme of enhancing the building and other infrastructure facilities of the school to seek recognition as an "[[International Baccalaureate]] World School".<ref name=woodford/>
