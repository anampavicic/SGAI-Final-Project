Historically, Bulawayo has been the principal industrial centre of Zimbabwe; its factories produce cars and car products, building materials, electronic products, textiles, furniture, and food products. Bulawayo is also the hub of Zimbabwe's rail network and the headquarters of the [[National Railways of Zimbabwe]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Tayana Tourism - Bulawayo |url=https://www.tayanatourism.com/bulawayo.html |access-date=2024-03-13 |website=www.tayanatourism.com |archive-date=1 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231001214140/http://tayanatourism.com/bulawayo.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:Bulawayo, Rhodesia -- 1976.jpg|thumb|left|Bulawayo in 1976]]

The city was founded by the Ndebele king [[Lobengula]], the son of King Mzilikazi, born of Matshobana,<ref name=":1" /> who settled in modern-day Zimbabwe around the 1840s.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} This followed the Ndebele people's great trek from northern [[Kwazulu]]. The name ''Bulawayo'' comes from the [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] word ''bulala'' and it translates to "the one to be killed". It is thought that at the time of the formation of the city there was a civil war. Mbiko ka Madlenya Masuku, a trusted confidant of [[King Mzilikazi]] and leader of the Zwangendaba regiment, fought Prince Lobhengula as he did not believe that he was the legitimate heir to the throne. This was because Lobhengula was born to a [[Swazi people|Swazi]] mother, and Masuku felt that she was of a lesser class. 

At the time Lobengula was a prince fighting to ascend his father's throne. It was common at the time for people to refer to Bulawayo as ''Bulawayo UmntwaneNkosi'', "a place where they are fighting or rising against the prince". The city of Bulawayo coincidentally has a similar name to the capital of the great [[Zulu Kingdom|Zulu]] warrior king [[Shaka]] ka Senzangakhona in [[Kwazulu]], where Mzilikazi and his [[Khumalo clan]] and other [[Nguni people]] came from.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Independent |first=The |title=June 1: Commemorating the history, culture of Bulawayo |url=https://www.newsday.co.zw/theindependent/tennis/article/2073/june-1-commemorating-the-history-culture-of-bulawayo |access-date=2024-03-19 |website=The Zimbabwe Independent |language=en |archive-date=19 March 2024 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240319061737/https://www.newsday.co.zw/theindependent/tennis/article/2073/june-1-commemorating-the-history-culture-of-bulawayo |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the 1860s, the city was influenced by European intrigue. Many colonial powers cast covetous eyes on Bulawayo and the land surrounding it because of its strategic location. Britain made skilful use of private initiative in the shape of [[Cecil Rhodes]] and the Chartered Company to disarm the suspicion of her rivals. Lobengula once described Britain as a chameleon and himself as the fly.<ref name=":1">{{cite journal |author=A.R.C.B. | year = 1961 | title = Review: A Russian Look at Rhodesia | journal = The Journal of African History | volume = 2 | issue = 1| pages = 161–162 | doi=10.1017/s0021853700002279| s2cid = 245909983 }}</ref>

During the 1893 [[First Matabele War]], [[British South Africa Company]] (BSAC) troops invaded and forced King Lobengula to evacuate his followers, after first detonating munitions and setting fire to the town.<ref>Thorpe, C. ''Limpopo to Zambesi'', London, 1951, p.51</ref> BSAC troops and white settlers occupied the ruins. On 4 November 1893, [[Leander Starr Jameson]] declared Bulawayo a settlement under the rule of the BSAC. Cecil Rhodes ordered the new settlement to be founded on the ruins of Lobengula's royal kraal, a typical action by a conquering power. This is where the [[State House (Bulawayo)|State House]] stands today.<ref name="DSO"/>

In 1897, the new town of Bulawayo acquired the status of municipality in the British colonial system, and Lt. Col. Harry White was appointed as one of the first mayors.<ref name="DSO">{{cite news|url=http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/LotDetailsPrintable.aspx?intObjectID=1550497|title=D.S.O.|date=19 April 1901|access-date=24 November 2013|publisher=London Gazette|archive-date=21 May 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240521143702/https://www.christies.com/404.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Britannica,

===Siege===
At the outbreak of the [[Second Matabele War]], in March 1896, Bulawayo was besieged by Ndebele forces. The settlers established a [[laager]] here for defensive purposes. The Ndebele had experienced the brutal effectiveness of the [[Maxim gun]]s employed by BSAC troops in the First Matabele War, so they never mounted a significant attack against Bulawayo, although over 10,000 Ndebele warriors gathered to surround the town.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} Rather than wait passively for attack, the settlers mounted patrols, called the Bulawayo Field Force, under [[Frederick Selous]] and [[Frederick Russell Burnham]]. These patrols rode out to rescue any surviving settlers in the countryside and attacked the Ndebele. In the first week of fighting, 20 men of the Bulawayo Field Force were killed and 50 were wounded. An unknown number of Ndebele were killed and wounded.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

During the siege, conditions in Bulawayo quickly deteriorated. By day, settlers could go to homes and buildings in the town, but at night they were forced to seek shelter in the much smaller laager. Nearly 1,000 women and children were crowded into the small area and false alarms of attacks were common.{{cn|date=March 2022}} The Ndebele neglected to cut the telegraph lines connecting Bulawayo to [[Mafikeng]]. The settlers and forces appealed for relief, and the BSAC sent additional troops from [[Harare|Salisbury]] and [[Masvingo|Fort Victoria]] (now Harare and Masvingo respectively) {{convert|300|mi|km|-2|abbr=off|order=flip}} to the north, and from [[Kimberley, South Africa|Kimberley]] and Mafeking {{convert|600|mi|km|-2|abbr=on|order=flip}} to the south. Once the relief forces arrived in late May 1896, the siege was broken. An estimated 50,000 Ndebele retreated into their stronghold of the [[Matobo Hills]] near Bulawayo. Not until October 1896 did the Ndebele finally surrender their arms to the invaders.{{cn|date=March 2022}}

===Modern era===
By the late 1930s, Bulawayo was no longer the country's biggest city. Influence and activity moved eastwards to the other cities, especially Salisbury, a trend which continues up to the present day. Despite this, after the [[World War II|Second World War]], prosperity and population growth revived, as the city became an industrial powerhouse, peaking during the Federal years as new markets opened in [[Malawi]] and [[Zambia]]. However, Bulawayo trailed the development of other cities notably, [[Johannesburg]], [[Harare]] and [[Cape Town]] during the same period.<ref name="ozy.com">{{cite web|url = https://www.ozy.com/around-the-world/once-zimbabwes-chicago-bulawayo-is-now-in-decay/92550/|title = Once Zimbabwe's Chicago, Bulawayo is Now in Decay|date = 10 February 2019|access-date = 15 February 2021|archive-date = 26 June 2022|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220626012041/https://www.ozy.com/around-the-world/once-zimbabwes-chicago-bulawayo-is-now-in-decay/92550/|url-status = dead}}</ref> In 1943, Bulawayo received city status.

[[File:Bulawayo City Hall.jpg|thumb|Bulawayo City Hall]]
[[File:Kenilworth Towers, Ascot.jpg|thumb|Kenilworth Towers, residential flats]]

By 1992, [[population decline]] and slow growth were beginning to occur which disproportionately affected heavy industry. In response, Bulawayo sought to re-invent itself as a 'heritage city', with its wide main streets refurbished and its [[Victorian architecture]] and industrial heritage preserved. Institutions such as the [[Bulawayo Railway Museum]] and [[Nesbitt Castle]] were restored. The city was also recognised as a centre of excellence in tertiary education and research, as the [[National University of Science and Technology, Zimbabwe]] was formed and expanded and other colleges growth also accelerated.<ref name="ozy.com"/>

Since the late 20th century, Bulawayo has suffered a sharp fall in living standards coinciding with the protracted [[Economy of Zimbabwe#2000–2009|economic crisis]] affecting the country. The main challenges the city faces include underinvestment, declining [[infrastructure]], [[de-industrialisation]] and the effects of corruption and nepotism. Much of the city's educated workers have migrated south to neighbouring South Africa or further afield to the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]] and [[Australia]].{{cn|date=March 2022}} Public service concerns have become steadily more acute, with particular concern in the health sector from a growing shortage of experienced doctors and nurses.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/small-scale-tobacco-farmers-are-giving-zimbabwe-reason-to-dream/82714/|title = Small-Scale Tobacco Farmers Are Giving Zimbabwe Reason to Dream|date = 22 February 2018|access-date = 15 February 2021|archive-date = 19 May 2022|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20220519062902/https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/small-scale-tobacco-farmers-are-giving-zimbabwe-reason-to-dream/82714/|url-status = dead}}</ref> As a result, the city faced an avoidable [[cholera]] outbreak in 2008. Though the city is the centre of the southern population generally categorized as the Matebele, the population includes various ethnicities, as well as a small number of expats, mostly from neighbouring countries.<ref name="ozy.com"/>

The Central Business District has the widest roads. These were designed to accommodate the ox-drawn carts, and to allow them to make a turn in the street, that were used as a primary means of transport when the town was planned and erected.{{citation needed|date=February 2022}}

Bulawayo is nicknamed the "City of Kings" or "kontuthu ziyathunqa"—a [[Northern Ndebele language|Ndebele]] phrase for "smoke arising". This name arose from the city's historically large industrial base. The large cooling towers of the coal-powered electricity generating plant situated in the city centre once used to exhaust steam and smoke over the city.<ref name="mg.co.za">{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2014-07-30-industrial-empire-reduced-to-a-ghost-town|title=Industrial empire Bulawayo reduced to a ghost town|date=30 July 2014|publisher=mg.co.za|access-date=30 July 2014|archive-date=8 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808040820/http://mg.co.za/article/2014-07-30-industrial-empire-reduced-to-a-ghost-town|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Economy==
Bulawayo was known as the industrial hub of Zimbabwe, leading to the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair being hosted in Bulawayo. It had a large manufacturing presence with large industries based here before Zimbabwe's economic decline.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} However, some of these companies have either moved operations to [[Harare]] or have closed down — which has crippled Bulawayo's economy. Most factories are deserted and the infrastructure has since been left to deteriorate.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}} The reason for the de-industrialization has largely been political, with some factories like Goldstar Sugars removing machinery to open new factories in Harare. When the Zimbabwean government passed indigenisation laws, some successful businesses were taken over by [[ZANU–PF]] supporters, only to close down a few years later.{{cn|date=August 2022}}

Many locals argue that it is because of marginalisation they experience against the government due to political tensions with the ZANU PF government in [[Harare]] and the MDC run Bulawayo council, for instance, the National railways of Zimbabwe (headquarters in Bulawayo) is a government owned entity and, as such, should have been thriving had it not been for embezzlement of funds by company executives who are believed to be Shona.{{citation needed|date=March 2022}} The water issue is not new and had brought about the "help a thirsty Matabele" initiative of the 1970s and the [[Matabeleland Zambezi Water Project]] which would put an end to the water issue in [[Matabeleland]] was drafted; however, this project was put on hold soon after independence.<ref name="state.gov">{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-investment-climate-statements/zimbabwe/#:~:text=Zimbabwe%20has%20attracted%20low%20investment,USD%20470%20million%20in%202018.|title=Zimbabwe|access-date=27 November 2020|archive-date=5 December 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201205074132/https://www.state.gov/reports/2019-investment-climate-statements/zimbabwe/#:~:text=Zimbabwe%20has%20attracted%20low%20investment,USD%20470%20million%20in%202018.|url-status=live}}</ref>

These allegations have all been refuted by national authorities. The city still contains the bulk of Zimbabwe's heavy industry and food processing capability.{{cn|date=November 2022}}

Like many parts of the country, Bulawayo has for the past ten years{{when|date=November 2017}} seen a huge drop in service delivery and an increase in unemployment, with many who can opting to seek better prospects abroad.{{cn|date=June 2022}} Many people resorted to farming, mining, and the black market for sustenance, while others depended on the little foreign currency that would be sent by family in other countries. However, with inauguration of the Mnangagwa government, a new approach is seen by investors in the city who admire the already-available infrastructure; the huge workforce; and Bulawayo as a potential business hub.<ref name="state.gov"/> It is set to once again contribute greatly to the economy of Zimbabwe.

==Geography==
Bulawayo is located in the south west of Zimbabwe. It is in the middle of the savanna country. It has four seasons, with rains starting in late October to about March. Coldest months being May and June with July being cold and windy.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/place/Zimbabwe Zimbabwe] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210307125733/https://www.britannica.com/place/Zimbabwe |date=7 March 2021 }}, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref>

===Topography===
The city sits on a plain that marks the Highveld of Zimbabwe and is close to the watershed between the [[Zambezi]] and [[Limpopo]] drainage basins. The land slopes gently downwards to the north and northwest. The southern side is hillier, and the land becomes more broken in the direction of the [[Matobo Hills]] to the south.
[[File:Petrea flowers, Bulawayo.jpg|thumb|[[Petrea]] flower in a garden in Bulawayo]]

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Bulawayo features a [[hot semi-arid climate]] (''BSh''). Due to its relatively high altitude, the city has fairly moderate temperatures despite lying in the tropics. The mean annual temperature is {{cvt|19.16|C}},<ref>GISS Climate data, Average annual temperature 1971 to 2001</ref> similar to [[Pretoria]] at a similar altitude but almost {{convert|600|km|mi|-1|disp=or}} further south. As with much of southern and eastern Zimbabwe, Bulawayo is cooled by a prevailing southeasterly airflow most of the year and experiences three broad seasons: a dry, cool winter season from May to August; a hot dry period in early summer from late August to early November; and a warm wet period in the rest of the summer, early November to April.

The hottest month is October, which is usually the height of the dry season. The average maximum temperature ranges from {{cvt|21|C}} in July to {{cvt|30|C}} in October. During the rainy season, daytime maxima are around {{cvt|26|C}}. Nights are always cool, ranging from {{cvt|8|C}} in July to {{cvt|16|C}} in January.

The city's average annual rainfall is {{convert|594|mm|in|frac=8|0|abbr=on}}, which supports a natural vegetation of open woodland, dominated by ''[[Combretum]]'' and ''[[Terminalia (plant)|Terminalia]]'' trees. Most rain falls in the December to February period, while June to August is usually rainless. Being close to the [[Kalahari Desert]], Bulawayo is vulnerable to droughts and rainfall tends to vary sharply from one year to another. In 1978, {{convert|888|mm|in|frac=8|0|abbr=on}} of rain fell in the three months up to February (February 1944 is the wettest month on record with {{convert|368|mm|in|frac=2|disp=or}}) while in the three months ending in February 1983, only {{convert|84|mm|in|frac=8|abbr=on}} fell.

=== Water supply ===
Bulawayo has good-quality tap water owing to the management of the water authorities, meeting international standards. Bulawayo does not recycle waste water but uses treated waste water for irrigation.{{citation needed|date=November 2021}}

Bulawayo experiences water shortages in drought seasons due to the overwhelming increase in population versus the static and sometimes decreasing capacity of the reserve dams. The geographical factors causing [[water scarcity]] are rising temperatures, the area's high elevation and the arid environment of [[Matabeleland]].{{citation needed|date=March 2022}}

Environmental and sanitation circumstances have detrimental effects on water quality. Sources such as groundwater and tap water are subject to pollution due to waste from burst sewers contaminating them. Samples taken from well water from the Pumula and Robert Sinyoka suburbs show that well water maintain levels of [[Coliform bacteria|coliform]] higher than the Standards Association of Zimbabwe and [[World Health Organization]] give.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=The impact of water scarcity on environmental health in selected residential areas in Bulawayo City, Zimbabwe|last1=Nyemba|first1=Anesu|last2=Manzungu|first2=Emmanuel|date=2010|journal=Physics and Chemistry of the Earth, Parts A/B/C|doi=10.1016/j.pce.2010.07.028|volume=35|issue=13–14|pages=823–827|bibcode=2010PCE....35..823N}}</ref><ref>Nyemba, Anesu.
