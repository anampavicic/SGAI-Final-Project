== Etymology ==
In 1514, Diego Velázquez founded the city San Cristóbal de la Habana, which meant "[[Saint Christopher]] of the Habana" and later became the capital of Cuba. Habana was the name of the local people group. It has been theorized that the name derived from [[Habaguanex]], who was a chief of the Native American tribe. His name is [[Taíno language|Taíno]], an [[Arawakan language]], but nothing else is known. When Habana was adapted into English, the {{angbr|b}} was switched to a {{angbr|v}} because of a linguistic phenomenon known as [[betacism]], which is an assimilation of the [[voiced bilabial plosive]] and [[voiced labiodental fricative]] sounds that occurs in most modern Spanish dialects. Usage of the word ''Havana'' in literature understandably peaked during the [[Spanish–American War]], but it also represents a type of cigar, a color, and a type of rabbit as well as the city.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Aleksic |first1=Adam |title=HABAGUANEX |url=https://www.etymologynerd.com/blog/habaguanex |website=The Etymology Nerd}}</ref> Havana is the prevailing name for the city found in English-language dictionaries.

=== 16th century ===

[[File:Jacquesdesores.jpg|thumb|French pirate [[Jacques de Sores]] looting and burning Havana in 1555]]

[[Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar]] founded Havana in 1514, on the southern coast of the island, near the present town of Surgidero de [[Batabanó, Cuba|Batabanó]] on the banks of the [[Mayabeque River]] close to [[Playa Mayabeque]]. However, all attempts to found a city on Cuba's south coast failed; an early map of Cuba drawn in 1514 places the town at the mouth of the river.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [[commons:File:LaHabanaalSur.jpg|Fundación de La Habana a orillas del Río Onicajinal o Mayabeque]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mayabeque.blogia.com/2009/092601-san-cristobal-de-la-habana-en-el-sur-analisis-historico-geografico-de-su-localiz.php |title=San Cristóbal de La Habana en el Sur |publisher=Mayabeque.blogia.com |date=August 19, 2010 |access-date=2013-01-08}}</ref>

Between 1514 and 1519 the Spanish established two settlements on the north coast, one of them in ''La Chorrera'', around the site of the [[Torreón de la Chorrera]], what eventually became the neighborhoods of Vedado and Miramar, next to the mouth of the [[Almendares River]]. The town that became Havana originated adjacent to what was then called ''Puerto de Carenas'' (literally, "[[Careening]] Port"), in 1519. The quality of this natural bay, which now hosts Havana's harbor, warranted this change of location.

[[Pánfilo de Narváez]] gave Havana – the sixth town founded by the Spanish on Cuba – its name: ''San Cristóbal de la Habana''. The name combines ''San Cristóbal'', [[patron saint]] of Havana. Shortly after the founding of Cuba's first cities, the island served as little more than a base for the ''Conquista'' of other lands.

Havana began as a trading port, and suffered regular attacks by [[buccaneer]]s, pirates, and [[French corsairs]]. The first attack and resultant burning of the city was by the French corsair [[Jacques de Sores]] in 1555. Such attacks convinced the Spanish Crown to fund the construction of the first fortresses in the main cities – not only to counteract the pirates and corsairs, but also to exert more control over commerce with the West Indies, and to limit the extensive ''contrabando'' ([[black market]]) that had arisen due to the trade restrictions imposed by the ''[[Casa de Contratación]]'' of [[Seville]] (the crown-controlled trading house that held a monopoly on New World trade).{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

Ships from all over the New World carried products first to Havana, to be taken by the fleet to Spain. The thousands of ships gathered in the city's bay also fueled Havana's agriculture and manufacture, since they had to be supplied with food, water, and other products needed to traverse the ocean.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

On 20 December 1592, [[King Philip II of Spain]] granted Havana the title of City. Later on, the city would be officially designated as "Key to the New World and Rampart of the West Indies" by the [[Spanish Crown]]. In the meantime, efforts to build or improve the defensive infrastructures of the city continued.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

=== 17th century ===

Havana expanded greatly in the 17th century. New buildings were constructed from the most abundant materials of the island, mainly wood, combining various [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian]] architectural styles, as well as borrowing profusely from [[Canary islands|Canarian]] characteristics. During this period the city also built civic monuments and religious constructions. The convent of St Augustin, El Morro Castle, the chapel of the Humilladero, the fountain of Dorotea de la Luna in La Chorrera, the church of the Holy Angel, the [[Hospital de San Lazaro, Havana|hospital de San Lázaro]], the monastery of Santa Teresa and the convent of San Felipe Neri were completed in this era.

In 1649 a fatal epidemic, brought from [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] in Colombia, affected a third of the population of Havana. In 1674, the works for the City Walls were started, as part of the fortification efforts. They would be completed by 1740.

By the middle of the 18th century Havana had more than seventy thousand inhabitants, and was the third-largest city in the Americas, ranking behind Lima and Mexico City but ahead of Boston and New York City.<ref>Thomas, Hugh: ''Cuba, A pursuit of freedom'', 2nd Edition, p. 1.</ref>

=== 18th century ===
[[File:Fachada principal de la catedral de la Habana, en La Ilustración Católica.jpg|thumb|left|[[Havana Cathedral]], 1748–1777]]
During the 18th century Havana was the most important of the Spanish ports because it had facilities where ships could be refitted and, by 1740, it had become Spain's largest and most active shipyard and only [[drydock]] in the New World.<ref>Harbron, John D..''Trafalgar and the Spanish navy'', Lestrange Maritime Press, 2004, {{ISBN|0-87021-695-3}}, pp. 15–17. Havana built nearly 50% more Ships of the Line than any other Spanish dockyard during the 18th century.</ref>

The city was captured by the British during the [[Seven Years' War]]. The [[Battle of Havana (1762)|episode]] began on 6 June 1762, when at dawn, a British fleet, comprising more than 50 ships and a combined force of over 11,000 men of the [[Royal Navy]] and Army, sailed into Cuban waters and made an amphibious landing east of Havana.<ref name="Seven Years War">{{cite book|last = Pocock |first = Tom|title = Battle for Empire: The very first world war 1756–63|chapter = Chapter Six|publisher =Michael O'Mara Books |date = 1998 |isbn = 978-1-85479-390-4}}</ref> The British immediately opened up trade with their [[North American]] and [[British West Indies|Caribbean colonies]], causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. Less than a year after Havana was seized, the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] was signed by the three warring powers thus ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Spanish Florida|Florida]] in exchange for the return of the city of Havana on to Spain.<ref name="Siege">Thomas, Hugh: Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom 2nd edition. Chapter One</ref>

After regaining the city, the Spanish transformed Havana into the most heavily fortified city in the Americas like [[Cartagena, Colombia]] a city that under the leadership of [[Blas de Lezo]] defeated a British invasion of 30,000 sailors. Construction began on what was to become the Fortress of [[La Cabaña|San Carlos de la Cabaña]], the third biggest Spanish fortification in the New World after [[Castillo San Cristóbal (San Juan)|Castillo San Cristóbal]] (the biggest) and [[Castillo San Felipe del Morro]] both in San Juan, Puerto Rico. On 15 January 1796, the remains of [[Christopher Columbus]] were transported to the island from [[Santo Domingo]]. They rested there until 1898, when they were transferred to [[Seville Cathedral|Seville's Cathedral]], after Spain's loss of Cuba.

As trade between Caribbean and North American states increased in the early 19th century, Havana became a flourishing and fashionable city. Havana's theaters featured the most distinguished actors of the age, and prosperity among the burgeoning middle-class led to expensive new classical mansions being erected. During this period Havana became known as the Paris of the [[Antilles]].

In 1837, the first railroad was constructed, a {{convert|51|km|abbr=on}} stretch between Havana and [[Bejucal]], which was used for transporting sugar from the valley of [[Güines]] to the harbor. With this, Cuba became the fifth country in the world to have a railroad, and the first Spanish-speaking country. Throughout the century, Havana was enriched by the construction of additional cultural facilities, such as the [[Great Theatre of Havana|Tacón Theatre]], one of the most luxurious in the world. The fact that slavery was legal in Cuba until 1886 led to Southern American interest, including a plan by the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]] to create a [[Golden Circle (proposed country)|'Golden Circle']] with a 1200{{nbsp}}mile-radius centered on Havana. After the [[Confederate States of America]] were defeated in the [[American Civil War]] in 1865, many former slaveholders continued to run plantations by moving to Havana.

In 1863, the city walls were knocked down so that the [[metropolis]] could be enlarged. At the end of the 19th century, Havana witnessed the final moments of Spanish presence in the Americas.

The sinking of the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|U.S. battleship ''Maine'']] in Havana's harbor in 1898 was the immediate cause of the [[Spanish–American War]].<ref>{{in lang |en}} [http://www.humboldt.edu/~jcb10/spanwar.shtml#anchor433004/ Spanish–American War] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20011117054641/http://www.humboldt.edu/~jcb10/spanwar.shtml#anchor433004/ |date=17 November 2001 }}, Effects of the Press on Spanish-American Relations in 1898</ref>

While Cuba had the highest ratio of hospital beds to population in Latin America, around 80% of these beds were located in the city of Havana, there was only one rural hospital and it was equipped with only 10 beds. In July 1940, during [[World War II]], the [[Havana Conference (1940)|Havana Conference]] was held and 21 American nations, including the host country Cuba, agreed to govern their own territories that were occupied by the [[Axis powers]].
In 1958, Cuba was a relatively well-advanced country by Latin American standards, and in some cases by world standards.<ref name=asce>{{Harvnb|Smith|Llorens|1998}}.</ref> On the other hand, Cuba was affected by perhaps the largest labor union privileges in Latin America, including bans on dismissals and mechanization.

The labor unions supported Batista until the very end. Batista stayed in power until he was forced into exile in December 1958.

After the [[Cuban Revolution|revolution of 1959]], the new government under [[Fidel Castro]] began to improve social services, public housing, and official buildings. Nevertheless, after Castro's abrupt expropriation of all private property and industry (May 1959 onwards) under a strong communist model backed by the Soviet Union followed by the U.S. [[United States embargo against Cuba|embargo]], shortages that affected Cuba in general hit Havana especially hard. By 1966–68, the Cuban government had [[nationalized]] all privately owned business entities in Cuba, down to "certain kinds of small retail forms of commerce" as per law No. 1076.<ref>{{cite web |author= Nigel Hunt |url= http://www.cubaheritage.org/articles.asp?lID=1&artID=236 |title= Cuba Nationalization Laws |publisher= cuba heritage .org |access-date= 8 July 2009 |archive-date= 16 September 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100916065256/http://www.cubaheritage.org/articles.asp?lID=1&artID=236 }}</ref>

An economic downturn occurred after the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] in 1991. Soviet subsidies ended, representing billions of dollars which the Soviet Union had given the [[Cuba – Soviet Union relations|Cuban government]]. Many believed the revolutionary government would soon collapse, as happened to the Soviet [[satellite state]]s of Eastern Europe.

===21st century===

After many years of economic struggle and prohibition, the socialist government has turned to [[tourism in Cuba|tourism]] for revenue and has brought foreign investors to remodel the nationalized, former Manzana de Gomez building, and turn it into the [[Gran Hotel Manzana Kempinski La Habana]], a new [[Hotel rating|5-star]] hotel attempting to develop a new hospitality industry. In Old Havana, a number of streets and squares have been rehabilitated in an effort to rebuild for tourists.<ref>{{cite web|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012210544/http://granma.cu/ESPANOL/2006/diciembre/juev7/elogian-e.html |archive-date = 12 October 2007 |title = Elogian capital humano en restauración de La Habana|work = Digital Granma Internacional|date = 7 December 2006|url = http://www.granma.cu/granmad/ESPANOL/2006/diciembre/juev7/elogian-e.html|language = es}}</ref> But Old Havana is a large city, and the restoration efforts concentrate in all on less than 10% of its area.

On the night of 27 January 2019, an unusually violent and destructive [[tornado]] ripped through Havana. The tornado killed eight people and injured over 190. It was assigned an official rating of EF4 on the [[Enhanced Fujita scale]] by the Cuban Meteorology Institute, making this the first F4 or EF4 tornado in Cuba since 1940.

== Administration ==
{{Recentism|date=December 2021}}
The governor is [[Reinaldo García Zapata]],<ref name="eleccionesencuba.cu"/> he was elected on 18 January 2020.<ref name="tribuna.cu"/>

The city is administered by a city-provincial council, with a governor as chief administrative officer,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Rodriguez |first=Andrea |date=18 January 2020 |title=Cuba elige gobernadores ajustándose a nueva Constitución |language=es |url=https://apnews.com/article/2fad9d6d53fa47b1a584e71fc5874506 |access-date=2022-07-26}}</ref> thus Havana functions as both a city and a province of Cuba. The city has little autonomy and is dependent upon the national government, particularly, for much of its budgetary and overall political direction.

[[File:Comité Central PCC.jpg|thumb|left|[[Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba|Comite Central del Partido Comunista de Cuba]] (Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party)]]

Voters elect delegates to Municipal Assemblies in competitive elections every five years, and the Municipal Assemblies are responsible for each of the city's boroughs. These assemblies elect the borough presidents and vice presidents, which are equivalents to mayors and vice mayors in the other provinces. There is only one political party, the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]], but since there must be a minimum of two candidates, members of the Communist Party often run against each other. Candidates are not required to be members of the party. They are nominated directly by citizens in open meetings within each election district. Municipal Assembly delegates within the boroughs in turn elect members of the Provincial Council (until 2019 the Provincial Assembly), which in Havana serves roughly as the City Council; its president appoints the Governor and Vice Governor, who serve as the Mayor and Vice Mayor of Havana and can be either elected by the council or appointed by the president with council confirmation. There are direct elections for the city's deputies to the National Assembly based on slates, and a portion of the candidates is nominated at the local level. The People's Councils (Consejos Populares) consist of local city delegates who elect a full-time representative to preside over the body. These councils are directly responsible for the city's neighbourhoods and wards. In addition, there is involvement of "mass organizations" and representatives of local government agencies, industries and services. The 105 People's Councils in Havana cover an average of 20,000 residents.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

Havana city borders are contiguous with the [[Mayabeque Province]] on the south and east and to [[Artemisa Province]] on the west, since former [[La Habana Province]] (rural) was abolished in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |date=October 17, 2024 |title=Proponen en Pleno del Partido dos nuevas provincias cubanas: Artemisa y Mayabeque (+ Infografía) |url=http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2010/06/07/cuba-tiene-dos-nuevas-provincias-artemisa-y-mayabeque/}}</ref>

== Geography ==
=== Location ===
[[File:La Habana Nasa.jpg|thumb|Satellite view of Havana in October 2005]]
[[File:Paseo del Prado, La Habana.jpg|thumb|right|[[Paseo del Prado, Havana]] in April 2019]]
Havana lies on the northern coast of Cuba along the [[Straits of Florida]], south of the [[Florida Keys]], where the [[Gulf of Mexico]] joins the Atlantic Ocean. The city extends mostly westward and southward from the bay, which is entered through a narrow inlet and which divides into three main harbors: Marimelena, Guanabacoa, and Atarés. The [[Almendares River]] traverses the city from south to north, entering the Straits of Florida a few miles west of the bay.{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

There are low hills on which the city lies rise gently from the waters of the straits. A noteworthy elevation is the 200-foot-high (60-meter) limestone ridge that slopes up from the east and culminates in the heights of [[La Cabaña]] and [[Castillo de los Tres Reyes del Morro|El Morro]], the sites of Spanish fortifications overlooking the eastern bay. Another notable rise is the hill to the west that is occupied by the [[University of Havana]] and the [[Castillo del Príncipe (Havana)]].{{citation needed|date=March 2024}}

=== Climate ===
Havana has a [[tropical climate]] that is tempered by the island's position in the belt of the [[trade wind]]s and by the warm offshore currents.{{clarify|date=December 2021}} Under the [[Köppen climate classification]], Havana has a [[tropical savanna climate]] (''Aw'') that closely borders on a [[tropical rainforest climate]] (''Af'') and a [[tropical monsoon climate]] (''Am''). Average temperatures range from {{convert|22|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in January and February to {{convert|28|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in August. The temperature seldom drops below {{convert|10|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The lowest temperature was {{convert|1|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in Santiago de Las Vegas, Boyeros. The lowest recorded temperature in Cuba was {{convert|0|°C|°F|abbr=on}} in Bainoa, [[Mayabeque Province]] (before 2011 the eastern part of Havana province). Rainfall is heaviest in June and October and lightest from December through April, averaging {{convert|1200|mm|in|abbr=on}} annually. Hurricanes occasionally strike the island, but they ordinarily hit the south coast, and damage in Havana has been less than elsewhere in the country.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |title=Havana {{!}} History, Climate, Population, & Facts {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Havana |access-date=2023-04-21 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> The most recent tropical cyclone to come near Havana at hurricane strength was [[Hurricane Ian|Ian]] in 2022.

Havana agglomeration grew rapidly during the first half of the 20th century reaching 1{{nbsp}}million inhabitants in the 1943 census. The con-urbanization expanded over the Havana municipality borders into neighbor municipalities of Marianao, Regla and Guanabacoa. Starting from the 1980s, the city's population is growing slowly as a result of balanced development policies, low birth rate, its relatively high rate of emigration abroad, and controlled domestic migration.

The Cuban government controls the movement of people into Havana on the grounds that the Havana metropolitan area (home to nearly 20% of the country's population) is overstretched in terms of land use, water, electricity, transportation, and other elements of the urban infrastructure.

=== Religion ===
[[File:Havana, Cuba (37585010486).jpg|thumb|Colonial [[Church Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje, Havana|Church Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje]], built between 1604 and 1693]]
[[Roman Catholic]]s form the largest religious group in Havana. Havana is one of the three Metropolitan sees on the island (the others being Camagüey and Santiago), with two suffragan bishoprics: Matanzas and Pinar del Río. Its patron saint is San Cristóbal ([[Saint Christopher]]), to whom the cathedral is devoted. it also has a [[minor basilica]], [[Basílica Santuario Nacional de Nuestra Señora de la Caridad del Cobre]] and two other national shrines, Jesús Nazareno del Rescate and San Lázaro (El Rincón). It received papal visits from three successive supreme pontiffs: [[Pope John Paul II]] (January 1998), [[Pope Benedict XVI]] (March 2012) and [[Pope Francis]] (September 2015).

The Jewish community in Havana has reduced after the Revolution from once having embraced more than 15,000 Jews,{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}} many of whom had fled [[Nazi]] persecution and subsequently left Cuba to Miami or to Israel after Castro took to power in 1959. The city once had five synagogues, but only three remain (one [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]], and two [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]: one Conservative [[Ashkenazi]] and one Conservative [[Sephardic]]), [[Beth Shalom Temple (Havana, Cuba)|Beth Shalom Grand Synagogue]] is one of them and another that is a hybrid of all 3 put together. In February 2007 the [[New York Times]] estimated that there were about 1,500 known Jews living in Havana.<ref>[http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/02/04/travel/04journeys.html?em&ex=1170824400&en=254a263b2686376e&ei=5087%0A 1,500 Jews who live in Cuba; 1,100 reside in Havana, and the remaining 400 are spread among the provinces.] In Cuba, Finding a Tiny Corner of Jewish Life.</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:Lonja del Comercio de La Habana vista desde la Avenida del Puerto.jpg|thumb|[[Lonja del Comercio building]]]]
Havana has a diversified economy, with traditional sectors, such as manufacturing, construction, transportation and communications, and new or revived ones such as biotechnology and tourism.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

The city's economy first developed on the basis of its location, which made it one of the early great trade centers in the New World. Sugar and a flourishing [[slave]] trade first brought riches to the city, and later, after independence, it became a renowned resort. Despite efforts by Fidel Castro's government to spread Cuba's industrial activity to all parts of the island, Havana remains the center of much of the nation's industry.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Havana/People | title=Havana - People &#124; Britannica }}</ref>

The traditional sugar industry, upon which the island's economy has been based for three centuries, is centered elsewhere on the island and controls some three-fourths of the export economy. But light manufacturing facilities, meat-packing plants, and chemical and pharmaceutical operations are concentrated in Havana. Other food-processing industries are also important, along with shipbuilding, vehicle manufacturing, production of alcoholic beverages (particularly rum), textiles, and tobacco products, particularly the world-famous [[Habanos S.A.|Habanos]] cigars.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog61/jtahtinen/economy.html |title=The economy of Havana |publisher=Macalester.edu |access-date=2010-04-17 |archive-date=2012-08-05 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805052129/http://www.macalester.edu/courses/geog61/jtahtinen/economy.html }}</ref> Although the [[harbor]]s of [[Cienfuegos]] and [[Matanzas]], in particular, have been developed under the revolutionary government, Havana remains Cuba's primary port facility; 50% of Cuban imports and exports pass through Havana. The port also supports a considerable fishing industry.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

In 2000, nearly 89% of the city's officially recorded labor force worked for government-run agencies, institutions or enterprises. Havana, on average, has the country's highest incomes and human development indicators. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba re-emphasized tourism as a major industry leading to its recovery. Tourism is now Havana and Cuba's primary economic source.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |title=Tourism in Cuba during the Special Period |access-date=2010-04-17|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100725185350/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/conferences/cuba/TLCP/Volume%201/Facio.pdf |archive-date = 25 July 2010}}</ref>

Havana's economy is still in flux, despite Raúl Castro's embrace of free enterprise in 2011. Though there was an uptick in small businesses in 2011, many have since gone out of business, due to lack of business and income on the part of the local residents, whose salaries average $20 per month.<ref>{{cite web|last=AP|title=Lack of Customers Dooms Many Cuban Businesses|url=http://weeklytimes.com/lack-of-customers-dooms-many-cuban-businesses/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228034327/http://weeklytimes.com/lack-of-customers-dooms-many-cuban-businesses/|archive-date=28 December 2013|publisher=Weekly Times|access-date=27 December 2013|date=27 December 2013}}</ref>

=== Commerce and finance ===
After the Revolution, Cuba's traditional capitalist free-enterprise system was replaced by a heavily socialized economic system. In Havana, Cuban-owned businesses and U.S.-owned businesses were nationalized and today most businesses operate solely under state control.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

In Old Havana and throughout Vedado there are several small private businesses, such as shoe-repair shops or dressmaking facilities. Banking as well is also under state control, and the [[National Bank of Cuba]], headquartered in Havana, is the control center of the Cuban economy. Its branches in some cases occupy buildings that were in pre-revolutionary times the offices of Cuban or foreign banks.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

In the late 1990s Vedado, located along the atlantic waterfront, started to represent the principal commercial area. It was developed extensively between 1930 and 1960, when Havana developed as a major destination for U.S. tourists; high-rise hotels, [[casino]]s, restaurants, and upscale commercial establishments, many reflecting the art deco style.<ref>{{cite web|title=De una casa colonial a una mansión del Vedado |url=http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=83 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041013131209/http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=83 |archive-date=13 October 2004 |access-date=11 July 2011 |language=es }}</ref>

[[Vedado]] is today Havana's financial district, the main banks, airline companies offices, shops, most businesses headquarters, numerous high-rise apartments and hotels, are located in the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=britannica.com |url=https://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-624418/Vedado |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012165946/https://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-624418/Vedado |archive-date=12 October 2007 |access-date=11 July 2011 }}</ref> The University of Havana is located in Vedado.

=== Tourism ===
[[File:Havana sightseeing bus.jpg|thumb|right|Sight-seeing busses at the [[Parque Central, Havana|Parque Central]]]]

The city has long been a popular attraction for tourists. Between 1915 and 1930, Havana hosted more tourists than any other location in the [[Caribbean]].<ref name="Miguel">{{cite conference |last1=Figueras |first1=Miguel Alejandro |title=International Tourism and the Formation of Productive Clusters in the Cuban Economy |url=http://www.world-tourism.org/quality/E/docs/trade/cubacontrib.pdf |conference=[[Latin American Studies Association]], 22nd Congress |access-date=27 August 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040805035546/http://www.world-tourism.org/quality/E/docs/trade/cubacontrib.pdf |archive-date=2004-08-05 |location=Washington, D.C. |date=September 2001 }}</ref> The influx was due in large part to [[Cuba-United States relations|Cuba's proximity to the United States]], where restrictive [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition]] on [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] and other pastimes stood in stark contrast to the island's traditionally relaxed attitude to leisure pursuits. A pamphlet published by E.C. Kropp Co., Milwaukee, WI, between 1921 and 1939 promoting tourism in Havana, Cuba, can be found in the University of Houston Digital Library, Havana, Cuba, The Summer Land of the World, Digital Collection.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

With the deterioration of [[Cuba – United States relations]] and the imposition of the [[United States embargo against Cuba|trade embargo]] on the island in 1961, tourism dropped drastically and did not return to anything close to its pre-revolution levels until 1989. The revolutionary government in general, and [[Fidel Castro]] in particular, opposed any considerable development of tourism. In 1982, the Cuban government passed a foreign investment code which opened a number of sectors to foreign capital.{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

Through the creation of firms open to such foreign investment (such as ''Cubanacan''), Cuba began to attract capital for hotel development, managing to increase the number of tourists from 130,000 (in 1980) to 326,000 (by the end of that decade).{{Citation needed|date=December 2021}}

Havana has also been a popular [[health tourism]] destination for more than 20 years. Foreign patients travel to Cuba, Havana in particular, for a wide range of treatments including [[eye-surgery]], [[neurological]] disorders such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]], and [[orthopaedics|orthopedics]]. Many patients are from Latin America, although medical treatment for [[retinitis pigmentosa]], often known as [[night blindness]], has attracted many patients from Europe and North America.<ref>[http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html A Novel Tourism Concept] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128054658/http://www.caribbeannetnews.com/news-3085--6-6--.html |date=28 January 2010 }} Caribbean News Net</ref><ref>{{cite news|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3284995.stm |title = Cuba sells its medical expertise|work = BBC News|first = Tom |last = Fawthrop|date = 21 November 2003}}</ref>

The years after the [[Soviet Union]] collapsed in 1991, the city, and Cuba in general have suffered decades of economic deterioration, including [[Special Period]] of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite news|title=Cuba - Overview|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/international/countriesandterritories/cuba/index.html|newspaper=New York Times|access-date=1 December 2011|first=Victoria|last=Burnett}}</ref> The national government does not have an official definition of poverty.<ref name=Cub_eco>Angela, Ferriol Maruaga; et al.: ''Cuba crisis, ajuste y situación social (1990–1996)'', La Habana, Cuba : Editorial de Ciencias Sociales, 1998, Champter 1</ref> The government researchers argue that "poverty" in most commonly accepted meanings does not really exist in Cuba, but rather that there is a sector of the population that can be described as "at risk" or "vulnerable" using internationally accepted measures.<ref name=Cub_eco />

The generic term "[[slum]]" is seldom used in Cuba, substandard housing is described: housing type, housing conditions, building materials, and settlement type. The National Housing Institute considers units in ''solares'' (a large inner-city mansion or older hotel or boarding house subdivided into rooms, sometimes with over 60 families)<ref name=cuarteria_def /> and [[shanty towns]] to be the "precarious housing stock" and tracks their number. Most slum units are concentrated in the inner-city municipalities of [[Old Havana]] and [[Centro Habana]], as well as such neighborhoods as ''Atarés'' in [[Regla]].<ref name=Problemas_socioambientales>González Rego, R. 1999.

[[Shanty towns]] are scattered throughout the city except for in a few central areas.<ref name=Problemas_socioambientales />

Over 9% of Havana's population live in ''cuartería'' (''solares, ciudadela''), 3.3% in [[shanty towns]], and 0.3% in refugee shelters.<ref name=Censo_vivienda /><ref name=Problemas_socioambientales /> This does not include an estimate of the number of people living in housing in "fair" or "poor" condition because in many cases these units do not necessarily constitute slum housing but rather are basically sound dwellings needing repairs. According to ''Instituto Nacional de Vivienda'' (National Housing Institute) official figures, in 2001, 64% of Havana's 586,768 units were considered in "good" condition, up from 50% in 1990. Some 20% were in "fair" condition and 16% in "poor" condition.<ref name=Problemas_socioambientales /> Partial or total building collapses are not uncommon, although the number had been cut in half by the end of the 1990s as the worst units disappeared and others were repaired. Buildings in Old Havana and Centro Habana are especially exposed to the elements: high humidity, the corrosive effects of salt spray from proximity to the coast, and occasional flooding. Most areas of the city, especially the highly populated districts, are in [[urban decay]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=24 March 2007|title=Havana's former grandeur decays and crumbles|work=Reuters|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cuba-havana-idUSN2034616720070324|access-date=2020-07-17}}</ref>

== Transport ==
=== Airports ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2022}}

Havana is served by [[José Martí International Airport]]. The Airport lies about {{convert|11|km|mi|0|sp=us}} south of the city center, in the municipality of [[Boyeros]], and is the main hub for the country's [[flag carrier]] [[Cubana de Aviación]]. The airport is Cuba's main international and domestic gateway, it connects Havana with the rest of the [[Caribbean]], [[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]] and South America, Europe and one destination in Africa.

The city is also served by [[Playa Baracoa Airport]] which is small airport to the west of city used for some domestic flights, primarily [[Aerogaviota]].

=== Rail ===
[[File:Inside train station Havana.jpg|thumb|left|Interior of the [[Central Railway Station, Havana|Central Railway Station]]]]
Havana has a network of suburban, interurban and long-distance rail lines. The railways are nationalized and run by the FFCC ([[Ferrocarriles de Cuba]] – Railways of Cuba). The FFCC connects Havana with all the provinces of Cuba, and the [[Havana Suburban Railway]] serves the city. The main railway stations are: [[Central Railway Station, Havana|Central Rail Station]], La Coubre Rail Station, [[Casablanca, Havana|Casablanca Station]], and Estación de Tulipán.

In 2004 the annual passenger volume was some 11{{nbsp}}million,<ref name=Censo_transporte>{{cite web|url=http://www.one.cu/aec2009/datos/13TRANSPORTE.pdf |title=Statistical Yearbook of Cuba 2009 |access-date=5 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110822200546/http://www.one.cu/aec2009/datos/13TRANSPORTE.pdf |archive-date=22 August 2011 }} National Statistics Census of Cuba – Transportation p. 6</ref> but demand is estimated at two-and-a-half to three times this value, with the busiest route being between Havana and [[Santiago de Cuba]], some {{convert|836|km|mi|sp=us}} apart by rail. In 2000 the Union de Ferrocarriles de Cuba bought French first class airconditioned coaches. New Chinese made and Russian made coaches for distance trains debuted in the 2010s, and some now serve suburban services.

In the 1980s there were plans for a [[Rapid Transit|Metro system]] in Havana similar to [[Moscow Metro|Moscow]]'s, as a result of the [[Soviet Union]] influence in Cuba at the time. The studies of geology and finance made by Cuban, Czech and Soviet specialists were already well advanced in the 1980s.<ref name=Hav_metro>[http://www.cubanet.org/sindical/news/y07/03290701.html Havana Metro] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119181627/http://www.cubanet.org/sindical/news/y07/03290701.html |date=19 January 2012 }} Hace unos años parecía que la capital cubana tendría metro, cuando en la década de 1980 los estudios de geología y finanzas realizados por especialistas cubanos y soviéticos iban muy adelantados.</ref> The Cuban press showed the construction project and the course route, linking municipalities and neighborhoods in the capital.<ref name=Hav_metro/> In the late 1980s the project had already begun, each mile (1.6{{nbsp}}km) of track was worth a million dollars at the time, but with the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|fall of the Soviet Union]] in 1991 the project was later dropped.<ref name=Hav_metro/>

{{Recentism|date=December 2021}}
[[File:Facultad de Matemáticas y Ciencias de la Computación.JPG|thumb|Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Science, University of Havana]]
The national government assumes all responsibility for education, and there are adequate primary, secondary, and vocational training schools throughout Cuba. The schools are of varying quality and education is free and compulsory at all levels except higher learning, which is also free.

The [[University of Havana]], located in the [[Vedado]] section of Havana, was established in 1728 and was regarded as a leading institution of higher learning in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Soon after the Revolution, the university, as well as all other educational institutions, were nationalized. Since then several other universities have opened, like the [[Polytechnic José Antonio Echeverría|Higher Learning Polytechnic Institute José Antonio Echeverría]] where the vast majority of today's Cuban engineers are taught.

The [[Cuban National Ballet School]] with 4,350 students is one of the largest ballet schools in the world and the most prestigious ballet school in Cuba.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html La Escuela Nacional de Ballet] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090623000202/http://www.bohemia.cubasi.cu/2006/04/28/cultura/ballet-formacion-humanista.html |date=23 June 2009 }} – La Escuela desarrolla una experiencia única en el mundo, enmarcada en la Batalla de Ideas.</ref>

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Plaza del Vapor, Calle Galiano, Havana.jpg|thumb|right|[[Plaza del Vapor, Havana]], of 1835]]

Havana has diverse styles of architecture, from castles built in the 16th century, to modernist high-rise buildings.
The present condition of many structures have deteriorated since 1959 or have been demolished, including the demolition of the [[Plaza del Vapor, Havana|Plaza del Vapor]], built in 1835 by the architect of the [[Palacio de la Marquesa de Villalba]], Eugenio Rayneri Sorrentino, the father of [[Eugenio Rayneri Piedra]] the architect of the [[El Capitolio]] of 1929. The [[Plaza del Vapor, Havana|Plaza del Vapor]] was demolished in 1959 by the new, revolutionary government.{{efn|The Plaza del Vapor met a similar fate in 1959 as the Paris food market [[Les Halles]] would meet in 1971. Les Halles, unable to compete in the new market economy and in need of massive repairs, the colorful ambiance once associated with the bustling area of merchant stalls, diappeared altogether when Les Halles was dismantled; the wholesale market was relocated to the suburb of [[Marché d'Intérêt National de Rungis|Rungis]]. Two of the glass and cast iron market pavilions were dismantled and re-erected elsewhere; one in the Paris suburb of [[Nogent-sur-Marne]], the other in [[Yokohama]], Japan.<ref name="auto">Parimage, "Les Halles, The New Heart of Paris". Mairie de Paris and SemPariSeine, July 2012.</ref> At the beginning of the 1959 Revolution Fidel Castro ordered to stop all construction in Cuba, and to have the Plaza del Vapor demolished; the ''Ministry of Public Health'' declared the Plaza del Vapor unhealthy and its vendors were resettled on the grounds of Calle Amistad between Calles Estrella and Monte where the demolished Mars and Belona dance academy had operated for years. The ''National Institute of Savings and Housing'' (INAV)replaced Batista's National Lottery, which had been abolished by the Revolutionary government, and a new lottery to raise money for new construction, and directed by Pastorita Núñez who projected that a new, modern building, not unlike those that were proposed by [[Josep Lluís Sert]] a year earlier in his [[Havana Plan Piloto]] of 1955–1958 would now be built in the empty lot.<ref name="fracasados">{{cite web|url=http://carlosbua.com/los-proyectos-inconclusos-o-fracasados-de-fidel-castro/|title=Los proyectos inconclusos o fracasados de Fidel Castro|access-date=2020-01-18}}</ref>}}{{efn|(INAV) is a state agency created with the objective of building houses for all Cubans who lacked them a lottery,<ref name="fracasados"/>}} Numerous building collapses throughout the city have resulted in injuries and deaths due to a lack of maintenance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-17935769|title=Cuba's crumbling buildings mean Havana housing shortage|last=Rainsford|first=Sarah|date=17 May 2012|newspaper=BBC News|access-date=2017-02-24|language=en-GB}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.havanatimes.org/?p=112640|title=Old Havana Building Collapse Kills Four - Havana Times.org|website=www.havanatimes.org|date=16 July 2015|language=en|access-date=2017-02-24}}</ref>

==== Spanish ====
[[File:Parte lateral del Castillo de la Real Fuerza.jpg|thumb|[[Castillo de la Real Fuerza|Castle of la Real Fuerza]], 1577]]
Riches were brought from the Spanish into and through Havana as it was a key [[transshipment]] point between the [[new world]] and [[old world]]. As a result, Havana was the most heavily fortified city in the Americas. Most examples of early architecture can be seen in military fortifications such as [[La Cabaña|La Fortaleza de San Carlos de la Cabana]] (1558–1577) designed by [[Battista Antonelli]] and the [[Morro Castle (Havana)|Castillo del Morro]] (1589–1630). This sits at the entrance of [[Havana Harbor|Havana Bay]] and provides an insight into the supremacy and wealth at that time.

Old Havana was also protected by a defensive wall begun in 1674 but had already overgrown its boundaries when it was completed in 1767, becoming the new neighborhood of [[Centro Habana]]. The influence from different styles and cultures can be seen in Havana's Spanish architecture, with a diverse range of [[Mudéjar art|Mudéjar architecture]], [[Spanish architecture|Spanish]], [[Architecture of Italy|Italian]], [[Ancient Greek architecture|Greek]] and [[Roman architecture|Roman]]. The [[San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary]] (18th century) is a good example of early Spanish influenced architecture. [[Cathedral of Havana|The Havana cathedral]] (1748–1777) dominating the Plaza de la Catedral (1749) is the best example of Cuban Baroque. Surrounding it are the former palaces of the Count de Casa-Bayona (1720–1746) Marquis de Arcos (1746) and the Marquis de Aguas Claras (1751–1775).

The [[Iglesia del Espíritu Santo, Havana|Iglesia del Espíritu Santo]] was devoted in 1638. The Espíritu Santo contains some notable paintings including a seated, post-crucifixion Christ on the right wall, and catacombs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-destinations.com/cuba/havana-iglesia-del-espiritu-santo|title=Sacred Destinations_havana-iglesia-del-espiritu-santo|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref> It is considered one of the oldest temples in Havana and it is said that its main interest lies essentially in the simplicity of the beautiful stone construction.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} The church was rebuilt and expanded in 1648 and given the rank of a parish. During the Spanish era it had exceptional importance, since by a [[Papal Bull]] of 1772 and a Royal Certificate of 1773, of [[Charles III of Spain]], it was declared "Única Iglesia inmune en esta ciudad, construida en 1855." ("the only immune church in this city, built-in 1855."), which meant that any persecuted individual could find Amparo (sanctuary) in it against the action of the authorities or of justice. A metal plaque at the foot of the bell tower attests to this fact.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} The Iglesia del Espíritu Santo's greatest interest from an architectural point of view lies in the simplicity of the coral stone construction and the lack of lavish decoration.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web |url= http://www.spc.int/DigitalLibrary/Doc/FAME/Reports/Anon_52_Coral_Building_Material.pdf|title=Coral as a Building_Material|access-date=2019-12-30}}</ref>{{efn|Many buildings in Havana are constructed out of coral stone including the [[Colegio Nacional de Arquitectos de Cuba]], [[Paseo del Prado, Havana|the promenade of El Prado]], and the [[San Carlos and San Ambrosio Seminary]]. Some of the exterior walls along Calle N on the ground floor of the podium of the [[FOCSA Building]] are covered with 12"x12" coral tiles.}} Other elements of great importance are the funerary crypts that were discovered in 1953. The crypt is from times before the [[Colon Cemetery, Havana|Colón Cemetery]] (1876) in El Vedado was built.

[[File:San Francisco de Paula - Havanna 001.jpg|thumb|left|Iglesia y hospital San Francisco de Paula]]
The [[La Alameda de Paula, Havana|Alameda de Paula]] was the first promenade in Cuba, designed and constructed in 1776 by Antonio Fernández Trevejo, following the instructions of the [[Laureano de Torres y Ayala]], it was created on the site of the old Rincón refuse dump. It was an embankment with two rows of poplar trees and some benches, it became one of Havana's most important social and cultural spaces, it was the model of the [[Paseo del Prado, Havana|Paseo del Prado]] designed in 1925. It was given the name Alameda de Paula because of its proximity to the old Hospital and Iglesia of San Francisco de Paula. Between 1803 and 1805 the pavement was tiled, a fountain and stone benches, lampposts and the marble column were added, it qualified as a pleasant entertainment for the residents of the [[History of Havana|Villa de San Cristóbal]], lacking recreational sites at that time. In 1841, the stairs that gave access to the promenade were widened and several lampposts were added. In the year 2000, the Havana promenade was restored and extended until it reached the Iglesia de San Francisco de Paula.<ref name=vieja>{{cite web|url=https://norfipc.com/cuba/la-iglesia-san-francisco-paula-habana-vieja.php|title=La Iglesia de San Francisco de Paula|access-date=2019-01-06}}</ref>

Towards the end of the 17th century, the first stone of what would be the hospital for women and the [[Iglesia de San Francisco de Paula, Havana|church of San Francisco de Paula]] was placed, the buildings were expanded in 1731 with the support and donations from the City Council and orders of the different General Captains in command of the island. In 1776, it was the most important hospital in Havana, there were several generations of famous doctors that trained here.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.habanaradio.cu/articulos/antigua-iglesia-de-san-francisco-de-paula/|title=Antigua Iglesia de San Francisco de Paula|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref> The [[Presbyter]] of the [[Havana Cathedral|Cathedral of Havana]], don Nicolás Estévez Borges, in 1664 ordered the construction of a Hospital for Women and an adjoining church devoted to [[Francis of Paola|Saint Francis of Paola]] who was one of the founders of the Roman Catholic Order of the [[Minim (religious order)|Minims]]. {{efn|The San Francisco de Paula Hospital for women began its functions in 1672, welcoming, in crowded conditions most of the time, black and white mentally ill patients. The gloomy aspect of the construction and the screams of the sick women made this place a well-known place in the area, but not for the reasons why hospitals like to be known, but as a gloomy reference. In the great 19th century Creole novel, Cecilia Valdés by Cirilo Villaverde, the church-hospital is evoked several times because, supposedly, Cecilia's mother was confined there when she lost the use of her mental faculties after the troubles and vicissitudes of her love affair with Don Cándido Gamboa.}} Both buildings were completely destroyed by a hurricane in 1730 and were rebuilt and enlarged in 1745 in the Baroque style seen today.<ref name=vieja/>

==== Neoclassical ====
[[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassism]] was introduced into the city in the 1840s, at the time including Gas public lighting in 1848 and the railroad in 1837. In the second half of the 18th century, sugar and coffee production increased rapidly, which became essential in the development of Havana's most prominent architectural style. Many wealthy ''Habaneros'' took their inspiration from the French; this can be seen within the interiors of upper-class houses such as the ''Aldama Palace'' built in 1844. This is considered the most important neoclassical residential building in Cuba and typifies the design of many houses of this period with portales of neoclassical columns facing open spaces or courtyards.

In 1925 [[Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier]], the head of urban planning in Paris moved to Havana for five years to collaborate with architects and landscape designers. In the master planning of the city his aim was to create a harmonic balance between the classical built form and the tropical landscape. He embraced and connected the city's road networks while accentuating prominent landmarks. His influence has left a huge mark on Havana although many of his ideas were cut short by the [[Great Depression|great depression in 1929]]. During the first decades of the 20th century Havana expanded more rapidly than at any time during its history. Great wealth prompted architectural styles to be influenced from abroad. The peak of Neoclassicism came with the construction of the [[Vedado|Vedado district]] (begun in 1859). This area features a number of set back well-proportioned buildings in the Neoclassical style.

[[File:Palacio-de-Villalba Condes-de-Casa-More Fotografia-Mestre-Petit, Havana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|Palacio de Villalba, photo of 1898]]

Built in 1875, in the Reparto de las Las Murallas, (wide strip of land that remained after the city walls were demolished in 1863), it was the work of the architect Eugenio Rayneri y Sorrentino.{{efn|Eugenio Rayneri y Sorrentino was the father of [[Eugenio Rayneri Piedra]] the architect of [[El Capitolio]].}} Around 1880 the mansion was owned by the Count of Casa Moré. The "La Flor de José Murias" tobacco factory was installed in the building. Later, through the exploitation of rents, it became a tenement house. In 1951 some of its spaces were dedicated to housing. On its upper floor, the Spanish Center and the Israeli Center of Cuba had their headquarters.

The palace of the Marquesa de Villalba and the [[Plaza del Vapor, Havana|Mercado de Tacón]] were designed by the Eugenio Rayneri y Sorrentino at almost the same time, 1875 and 1876, respectively, each in a style that accommodated the particular typology (residential and commercial) thus conceiving each work with the formal element accommodating different aesthetic requirements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/fotosdelahabana/permalink/933297227433960/|title=El palacio de la marquesa de Villalba|website=Facebook|access-date=2021-12-01}}</ref> The property is, after the [[Palacio de Aldama|Aldama Palace]], the strongest example of Cuban Neoclassicism. The palace of the Marquesa de Villalba is in the neoclassical style, perhaps only comparable in Havana – according to Alina Castellanos – to the Aldama Palace. But while the latter limits the decoration to the natural slenderness of the colonnade, in the most classical way of the Greek Parthenon, the former uses Roman and Renaissance elaborations, hence, the arcade has been projected on pillars, the building was crowned with a considerable cornice. The neoclassical decoration can also be seen in the window covers, which take alternate forms of a triangular or semicircular pediment, and glass over the door, similar to the [[Plaza del Vapor, Havana|Plaza del Vapor]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://habanacultural.ohc.cu/?p=12093|title=Andar por la Plazuela de las Ursulinas|access-date=2021-12-01}}</ref>

The [[Palacio de Aldama]] is a neoclassical mansion located diagonally opposite to the old [[Plaza del Vapor, Havana|Plaza del Vapor]] (Parque del Curita), and in front of the old [[Campo de Marte, Havana|Campo de Marte]]; present day Parque de la Fraternidad, in Havana, Cuba. Built in 1840 by the Dominican architect and engineer Manuel José Carrera, its main facade of columns spans one block on Calle Amistad between Calles Reina and Estrella.

[[File:Royal Palm Hotel (Havana), entrance.jpg|thumb|left|Royal Palm Hotel (Havana), entrance, c. 1930]]

The Royal Palm Hotel is located on the corner of San Rafael and Industria. It was inaugurated as "Edificio Luis. E. del Valle", in honor of the sugar magnate who owned the building. However, it was soon sold to Canadian Wilbur E. Todgham, who turned it into the famed Royal Palm Hotel.<ref name="Royal">{{cite web|url=https://www.cibercuba.com/noticias/2020-01-15-u199370-e199370-s27315-royal-palm-corazon-habana-hotel-famoso-edificio|title=Royal Palm, en el corazón de La Habana, de hotel famoso a edificio multifamiliar|date=15 January 2020 |access-date=2022-01-06}}</ref> The commercial function of the ground floor has been preserved to date, taking advantage of its excellent location on Boulevard de San Rafael. Taking into account the architectural values of this building and its socio-cultural importance within the urban landscape in which it is located, the building received a major restoration in 2000, with the support of the Provincial Council of Seville, Spain.<ref name="Royal"/>

[[File:Edificio Bacardí, La Habana, Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|Bacardí Building]]
The [[Bacardi Building (Havana)|Bacardi Building]] (''Edificio Bacardí'') is Havana landmark designed by the architects Esteban Rodríguez-Castells and Rafael Fernández Ruenes and completed in 1930.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/list/7-iconic-buildings-in-havana|title=7 Iconic Buildings in Havana, Cuba &#124; Britannica|website=www.britannica.com}}</ref> It is located on the corner of Calles Monserrate and San Juan de Dios on a 1,320{{nbsp}}sq meter lot in Las Murallas, [[Old Havana]].

The [[FOCSA Building]] is a residential block in the Vedado neighborhood of Havana, Cuba. It was named after the contracting company ''Fomento de Obras y Construcciones, Sociedad Anónima'', and the architects were Ernesto Gómez Sampera (1921–2004), Mercedes Diaz (his wife), and [[Martín Domínguez Esteban]] (1897–1970), who was the architect of the [[Radiocentro CMQ Building]]. The structural engineer was Luis Sáenz Duplace, of the firm Sáenz, Cancio & Martín, and professor of engineering at the [[University of Havana]]. The civil engineers were Bartolome Bestard and Manuel Padron. Gustavo Becquer and Fernando H. Meneses were the mechanical and electrical engineers, respectively.<ref name=Fox>Fox, Arthur.

[[File:Havana Districts Map (2022).svg|thumb|right|upright=1.5 |Havana Districts Map]]
Contemporary Havana can essentially be described as three cities in one: [[Old Havana]], [[Vedado]], and the newer suburban districts.<ref name=":2" /> Old Havana, with its narrow streets and overhanging balconies, is the traditional centre of part of Havana's commerce, industry, and entertainment, as well as being a residential area.

To the west a newer section, centred on the uptown area known as [[Vedado]], has become the rival of Old Havana for commercial activity and nightlife. The [[National Capitol Building (Havana)|''Capitolio Nacional'']] building marks the beginning of Centro Habana, a working-class neighborhood that lies between Vedado and Old Havana.<ref>[http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=32 Centro Habana] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519110017/http://www.paseosporlahabana.com/cats.asp?cID=32 |date=19 May 2007 }} – Centro Habana guia turistica, Cuba</ref> Barrio Chino and the [[Real Fabrica de Tabacos Partagás]], one of Cuba's oldest cigar factories is located in the area.<ref>{{cite web|author=CubaJunky.com |url=http://www.cuba-junky.com/havana/havana-casas-particular-viejaycentro.html |title=Centro Habana |publisher=Cuba-junky.com |date= |access-date=2010-04-17}}</ref>

A third Havana is that of the more affluent residential and industrial districts that spread out mostly to the west. Among these is [[Marianao]], one of the newer parts of the city, dating mainly from the 1920s. Some of the suburban exclusivity was lost after the revolution, many of the suburban homes having been nationalized by the Cuban government to serve as schools, hospitals, and government offices. Several private country clubs were converted to public recreational centres. [[Miramar, Havana|Miramar]], located west of Vedado along the coast, remains Havana's exclusive area; mansions, foreign embassies, diplomatic residences, upscale shops, and facilities for wealthy foreigners are common in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cactuslanguage.com/en/book/course.php?course_id=1045 |title=Havana Miramar School |publisher=Cactuslanguage.com |access-date=2010-04-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208194543/http://www.cactuslanguage.com/en/book/course.php?course_id=1045 |archive-date=2010-02-08 }}</ref> The [[International School of Havana]] is located in the Miramar neighborhood.

In the 1980s many parts of [[Old Havana]], including the Plaza de Armas, became part of a projected 35-year{{nbsp}}multimillion-dollar restoration project, for Cubans to appreciate their past and boost tourism. In the past ten years{{which|date=May 2022}}, with the assistance of foreign aid and under the support of local city historian Eusebio Leal Spengler, large parts of Habana Vieja have been renovated. The city is moving forward with their renovations, with most of the major plazas (Plaza Vieja, Plaza de la Catedral, Plaza de San Francisco and Plaza de Armas) and major tourist streets (Obispo and Mercaderes) near completion.

[[File:Radiocentro CMQ logo1950. Havana, Cuba.png|left|thumb|80px]]

[[File:Radiocentro CMQ Building. Havana, Cuba.jpg|right|thumb|Radiocentro CMQ Building, Havana]]

CMQ was a Cuban radio and television station located in Havana, [[Cuba]], reaching an audience in the 1940s and 1950s, attracting viewers and listeners with a program that ranged from music and news dissemination. It later expanded into radio and television networks. As a radio network it was a heated competitor of the [[RHC-Cadena Azul]] network.
The company was founded on March 12, 1933, by Miguel Gabriel and Ángel Cambó. Ten years later, on August 1, 1943, half of it was acquired by the business group of [[Goar Mestre]]. In the beginning, it transmitted only in the capital expanding later to the rest of the country.

Pre-revolutionary Cuba was an early adopter of new technology, including TV. Cuba was the first Latin American country to have television. In December 1946 station CM-21P conducted an experimental multi-point live broadcast.

Regular commercial broadcasting began in October 1950 with Gaspar Pumarejo's [[Unión Radio TV]]. This was followed by Goar Mestre Espinosa's '''CMQ-TV''' on channel 6 on 18 December 1950. CMQ officially launched on 11 March 1951, and would become an [[NBC]] affiliate. By 1954, CMQ-TV had expanded into a seven station network. With the CMQ network, Cuba the second country in the world, only after the United States, to have a national TV network.<ref name=et>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CFXgj7a55agC&dq=cmq-tv&pg=PA636|title=Encyclopedia of Television |first1=Horace|last1=Newcomb|first2=Museum of Broadcast|last2=Communications|date=2 March 2004|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn|isbn=978-1-57958-394-1 |via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cuba1952-1959.blogspot.com/2009_02_01_archive.html|title=Cuba Baseball & TV- 1955 World Series |first=R.|last=Aranda|date=17 February 2009}}</ref>

At the beginning of the 1950s with the transmission of the novel ''El Derecho de Nacer'', by Felix B. Caignet, displaced the competing station, RHC Cadena Azul. It is with this leadership that the second Cuban television channel, CMQ TV, Channel 6 is born. It was initially located on Calle Monte, on the corner of Paseo del Prado. On 12 March 1948, the radio studio was moved to the [[Radiocentro CMQ Building|Radiocentro building]] in La Rampa and Calle L in [[El Vedado]].{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}
