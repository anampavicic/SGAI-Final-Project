==History==

===18th century to World War II===
{{see also|Spanish missions in California}}
[[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel]] was initially founded on September 8, 1771, near settlements of the [[Tongva]] people. It was located in the Whittier Narrows on a bluff overlooking the Rio Hondo, near the modern intersection of San Gabriel Blvd and Lincoln Avenue.<ref name="Kyle">Kyle, Douglas E. (1990). ''Historic Spots in California'', 4th ed. Stanford, CA: [[Stanford University Press]].</ref> After five years, flooding forced the relocation of the mission to its present site in [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mission San Gabriel Arcangel (CA Mission #4) |url=https://theclio.com/entry/54297 |access-date=June 26, 2022 |website=Clio |language=en}}</ref>

In 1784, Governor [[Pedro Fages]] granted to former soldier [[Manuel Nieto (soldier)|Manuel Nieto]] (1734–1804) the largest of the land concessions made in what was then [[Alta California]], a province of [[New Spain]]. Its {{convert|300,000|acre|ha km2}} stretched from the [[Santa Ana River]] on the east to the Old [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] (now the [[Rio Hondo (California)|Rio Hondo]] and [[Los Angeles River]]) on the west, and from the mission highway (approximately [[Whittier Boulevard]]) on the north to the ocean on the south. Its acreage was slightly reduced later at the insistence of [[Mission San Gabriel]] on whose lands it infringed. The Spanish concessions, of which 25 were made in California, were unlike the later Mexican land grants in that title was not transferred but were similar to grazing permits with the title remaining with the Spanish crown.<ref>Beck, Warren A., Haase, Ynez D. (1974). ''Historical Atlas of California''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.</ref>

The [[Rancho Los Nietos]] passed to Manuel Nieto's four children upon his death and remained intact until 1833 when his heirs petitioned [[List of pre-statehood governors of California|Mexican Governor]] [[José Figueroa]] to partition the property. The northwestern portion of the original [[Ranchos of California|rancho]], comprising the Downey-[[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]] area, was granted as [[Rancho Santa Gertrudes]] to Josefa Cota, the widow of Manuel's son, Antonio Nieto. At approximately {{convert|21,000|acre|ha km2}}, Santa Gertrudes was itself a sizable rancho and contained the old Nietos homestead, which was a center of social life east of the pueblo of Los Angeles.<ref>Quinn, Charles Russell (1973).

Dairy was a major industry in Downey. The Central Milk Agency marketed the milk for "seven hundred dairymen whose dairy herds range from thirty to two thousand head" with the value of the products marketed in excess of $1,000,000 per month.<ref>{{cite book|last=Morrison|first=Easter Bangle|title=History of Downey and Vicinity|date=1939|page=118}}</ref> 
 
Some of Downey's settlers came from [[Ireland]].<ref name=Ireland>{{cite web|url=http://www.jdcjr.us/irish.html|title=John's Irish History|access-date=April 22, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310024926/http://jdcjr.us/irish.html|archive-date=March 10, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> Downey was founded by and named for the former and youngest ever [[governor of California]], [[John G. Downey|John Gately Downey]], who was born in Ireland. Although he was an Irish Democrat, he supported the Republican Lincoln in his efforts to keep the Union intact during the [[American Civil War]]. He pioneered the modern [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]]<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sonksen |first=Mike |date=2015-06-22 |title=Downey: From Orange Groves to the Apollo Space Program |url=https://www.pbssocal.org/history-society/downey-from-orange-groves-to-the-apollo-space-program |access-date=2024-07-16 |website=PBS SoCal |language=en}}</ref> with land he acquired between the [[Rio Hondo (California)|Rio Hondo]] and the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]], in about 1865. Downey was convinced that oranges would flourish in Southern California, so he imported several varieties, and therefore set in motion what became one of the state's biggest cash crops.<ref name=Ireland/>

===Gallatin===
Two small settlements were established along the Rio Hondo River - '''College Settlement''' and '''Gallatin''', near where the modern Paramount Boulevard and Florence Avenue cross. In the late 1860s, the Gallatin residents built a small school known as the "Little Red Gallatin School House". By 1871, it was not large enough and a two-story school was built. Gallatin School moved in 1893 to its present site. Later, Alameda School and Downey School were built. By 1883, College Settlement, Gallatin and Downey joined and with the help of Governor Downey convinced the Southern Pacific Railroad to route through and stop in Downey. The new center of activity migrated to the depot area and this became the center of a new larger Downey, uniting the three previous settlements.<ref>{{cite news |title=Looking back on Gallatin Elementary School|publisher=Downey Patriot|date=January 8, 2010|last=Pierce|first=Eric|url= https://www.thedowneypatriot.com/articles/looking-back-on-gallatin-elementary-school?format=amp}}</ref>

===After World War II===
[[File:Vultee Vengeance production at Downey CA.jpg|thumb|right|Workers in Downey building [[Vultee A-31 Vengeance|Vultee Vengeance]] bombers for the [[Royal Air Force]] in 1943<ref name="Parker, Dana T. p. 107-20">Parker, Dana T. ''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' p. 107-20, Cypress, CA, 2013. {{ISBN|978-0-9897906-0-4}}.</ref>]]
Farmers in the area grew grain, corn, [[castor bean]]s, and fruit, and by 1935 Downey was characterized as an "orange-grove town".<ref>Romance & History of California Ranchos. Myrtle Garrison. 1935. page 11. Harr Wagner Publishing Company, San Francisco, CA.</ref> 
Downey was incorporated in 1956 and instituted a [[Municipal charter|charter]] form of government in 1964. Suburban homes and factories replaced the farms after World War II.

====Aerospace====
[[Vultee Aircraft]] was Downey's largest employer during World War II producing 15% of all of America's military aircraft by 1941.<ref>Parker, Dana T. ''Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II,'' p. 107, Cypress, CA, 2013. {{ISBN|978-0-9897906-0-4}}.</ref> The company was a pioneer in the use of women in manufacturing positions and was the first aircraft company to build airplanes on a powered assembly line.<ref name="Parker, Dana T. p. 107-20"/> Vultee became a part of [[North American Aviation]] (later [[North American Rockwell]], then [[Rockwell International]] which was then bought by the [[Boeing]] company) whose facilities were the birthplace of the systems for the [[Apollo program|Apollo Space Program]] as well as the [[Space Shuttle]]. For over 70 years, Downey's Rockwell [[NASA]] plant produced and tested many of the 20th century's greatest aviation, missile, and space endeavors.

The seventy-year history of airplane and space vehicle manufacturing in Downey came to an end when the Rockwell plant closed in 1999. The former North American Rockwell plant was demolished, and replaced by the [[Space Shuttle Columbia#Tributes and memorials|Columbia Memorial Space Center]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbiaspacescience.org|title=Columbia Memorial Space Center -|access-date=April 22, 2016}}</ref> Downey Landing shopping center, [[Promenade at Downey]] shopping center (the former [[movie studio]] site of [[Downey Studios]]), a [[Kaiser Permanente]] hospital, and a city recreation fields park.

====Other landmarks====
Near the center of the city lies what was in the 1960s one of the busiest intersections in California, the intersection of Lakewood Boulevard ([[California State Route 19|State Route 19]]) and Firestone Boulevard (former [[California State Route 42|State Route 42]]). Route 19 was a major thoroughfare between [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and the port at [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and Route 42 was along part of the old Spanish [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]] trail that connected [[Pueblo de Los Angeles]] to [[San Diego]].

In the 1960s, the town's Downey Records achieved some notoriety with recordings such as [[The Chantays]]' surfing instrumental "[[Pipeline (instrumental)|Pipeline]]"; nearly two decades later, Downey local music scene led to the founding of [[The Blasters]] and [[Dark Angel (band)|Dark Angel]].

Downey is home to [[Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center]] which is the main public rehabilitation hospital for [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]]. Rancho Los Amigos is renowned worldwide for its innovative contributions to the care of [[Spinal cord injury|spinal cord injuries]] and [[post-polio syndrome]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rancho.org|title=Official Rancho Los Amigos National Rehabilitation Center website|access-date=July 29, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140224085939/http://www.rancho.org/|archive-date=February 24, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Downey was featured in the 2008 American action-comedy film ''[[Pineapple Express (film)|Pineapple Express]]''. Many of the buildings along Florence Avenue are seen in a driving sequence early in the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0910936/locations?ref_=tt_ql_dt_6|title=Pineapple Express (2008)|work=IMDb|access-date=April 22, 2016}}</ref>

Downey is home to the world's oldest existing [[McDonald's]] Restaurant, the so-called Speedee McDonald's Store, which opened in 1953 at the southwest corner of Florence Avenue and Lakewood Boulevard. Damaged in the [[1994 Northridge Earthquake]], the store reopened in 1996 along with a museum and gift shop.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/m.asp?m=51959|title=The Speedee McDonald's Store|work=The Historical Marker Database|access-date=May 19, 2024}}</ref>

The author [[Tom Wolfe]] wrote about Downey. His article "The Hair Boys" was about Harvey's Drive-in and the fashions that the hair boys wore. He claimed that Harvey's was one of the great unacknowledged centers of fashion in the world. The essay appears in his 1968 book "The Pump House Gang." His drawing of one of the hair boys appears in his book "In Our Time."

In 1955, Downey was featured in newspapers worldwide when truck driver George Di Peso lived at 7739 Alderdale Street and had a [[gopher]] problem. He tried to solve it by putting a hose down a gopher hole and turning on the water to drown it, but could not get the hose out afterwards. He then noticed that the hose was slowly being pulled down the hole. Wire services found out about this, and the mysterious phenomenon was reported in newspapers worldwide. According to a July 3, 1955, front-page article in the ''Los Angeles Times'' ("Tokyo Awaits Arrival of Downey Hose"), "A message received from Tokyo at the United Press office here read 'Tell Di Peso in Downey the other end of his hose has not turned up here, but we're all still looking.'" There was a great deal of speculation about the cause of the disappearing hose. Eventually the hose vanished completely. The most likely explanation was that there was an underground river that pulled at the hose.

In the early 1960s, it was widely reported that the Downey City Library had banned Edgar Rice Burroughs' ''Tarzan'' books because Tarzan was not married to Jane when they conceived Boy. Evidence for the rumor's staying power is in articles in the ''Los Angeles Times'' that were published in the 1970s (for example, "Downey Sends L.A. Back to the Bush League," Jack Smith, May 8, 1970). The rumor about Tarzan was, however, an exaggeration. According to "Zane Grey Also Safe: Tarzan’s Marital Status No Issue as Downey School Ban Is Denied" (''Los Angeles Times'' December 28, 1961), a rumor spread that one of Downey's elementary schools had removed Edgar Rice Burroughs and Zane Grey books from its library because "1—There was no indication that Tarzan and his mate, Jane, were ever married before they took up housekeeping in the treetops," and "2—Grey was known to put such expletives as 'damn!’ and 'hell' in the mouths of his western cowhands." It turns out that there was no "ban." What happened was that in one elementary school, a parent had put two Zane Grey books "out of site in a desk drawer." No Tarzan books were involved. The Zane Grey books were put back on the shelves.

===Public libraries===
The Downey City Library serves the city. The first library in Downey was established in 1901 by a women's social club that was founded in 1898. The [[County of Los Angeles Public Library]] opened a branch in Downey in September 1915. The county branch moved several times; its final location was in the County Civic Center. In 1958 the Downey City Council voted to establish its own library and withdraw from the county system. The city library services were originally provided out of the back of a bookstore. The city library opened in the former cafeteria of the former Downey Elementary School, then being used as the city hall and police station, on July 1, 1958. A permanent library building was built on December 7, 1959. It had almost {{convert|16000|sqft|sqm}} and it was built for $186,200, costing $11.97 per square foot. It was dedicated on December 17 and opened on December 18. In February 1984 an addition of almost {{convert|12000|sqft|sqm}} was completed and dedicated.<ref>"[http://www.downeylibrary.org/about/ About the Library] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105230027/http://www.downeylibrary.org/about/ |date=January 5, 2010 }}." Downey Public Library. Retrieved on March 5, 2010.</ref>

In March 2019, the city announced that it would be using Measure S funds to begin remodeling on the city library. The remodeling was initially supposed to last 15 months, but the COVID-19 pandemic caused delays in the project. The remodeled city library opened on May 3, 2021, with notable updates including mobile app support for checkouts and a multi-use community space.<ref>{{Cite web |title=After 2-year closure, Downey Library reopens |url=https://www.thedowneypatriot.com/articles/after-2-year-closure-downey-library-reopens |access-date=April 28, 2023 |website=The Downey Patriot |date=May 6, 2021 |language=en-US}}</ref>
