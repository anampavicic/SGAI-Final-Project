'''Pforzheim''' ({{IPA|de|ˈpfɔʁtshaɪm|-|Pforzheim.ogg}}) is a [[List of cities and towns in Germany|city]] of over 125,000 inhabitants in the federal state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], in the southwest of [[Germany]].

It is known for its jewelry and watch-making industry, and as such has gained the nickname "Goldstadt" ("Golden City"). With an area of {{convert|97.8|km2}}, it is situated about halfway between the cities of [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]] at the confluence of three rivers ([[Enz]], [[Nagold (river)|Nagold]] and [[Würm (Nagold)|Würm]]). It marks the frontier between [[Baden]] and [[Württemberg]], being located on Baden territory. From 1535 to 1565, it was the home to the [[Margraviate of Baden-Durlach|Margraves of Baden-Durlach]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kleine Stadtchronik: Stadt Pforzheim |url=https://www.pforzheim.de/stadt/stadtgeschichte/kleine-stadtchronik.html |access-date=2023-08-20 |website=www.pforzheim.de |publisher=City of Pforzheim |language=de}}</ref>

The City of Pforzheim is a ''[[Districts of Germany|Stadtkreis]]'', meaning it is both a [[municipality]] and a [[Districts of Germany|district]] at the same time. Also, it hosts the administrative offices of the [[Enz (district)|Enz]] district that surrounds the city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Städte & Gemeinden |url=https://www.enzkreis.de/Landkreis-Politik/Städte-Gemeinden/?La=1&NavID=3397.20 |access-date=2023-08-20 |website=Landratsamt Enzkreis |publisher=Enz district |language=de}}</ref>

During [[World War II]], Pforzheim was bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] a number of times. The largest raid, and one of the most devastating [[area bombardment]]s of World War II, was carried out by the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) on the evening of 23 February 1945. Nearly one third of the town's population, 17,600 people, were killed in the air raid, and about 83% of the town's buildings were destroyed. The Allies believed that precision instruments were being produced here for use in the German war effort and that the town was a transport centre for the movement of German troops.

From 1945 to 1948, Pforzheim (after the initial French occupation) was [[American-occupied zone of Germany|administered by the United States military]] and was part of the short-lived state of [[Württemberg-Baden]]. In the 20 years following the end of the war, Pforzheim was gradually rebuilt. The town reflects the architecture of the [[Post-war|postwar period]] and has some landmark buildings of the 1950s.

==Geography==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2021}}
Pforzheim is located at the northern rim of the eastern part of the [[Black Forest]] (Schwarzwald) and the rim of the hilly country of the [[Kraichgau]], in an open valley at the confluences of the rivers [[Würm]] and [[Nagold]], as well as the rivers Nagold and [[Enz]]. Due to its location, this city is also called the "three-valleys town" (''Drei-Täler Stadt'') or the "Gateway to the Black Forest" (''Pforte zum Schwarzwald / Porta Hercynia'').

Pforzheim and its surrounding area belongs to the "Densely Populated Area Karlsruhe/Pforzheim". Pforzheim has the functions of a regional center (Mittelzentrum) for the towns and municipalities [[Birkenfeld (Enz)]], [[Eisingen]], [[Engelsbrand]], [[Friolzheim]], [[Heimsheim]], [[Ispringen]], [[Kämpfelbach]], [[Keltern]], [[Kieselbronn]], [[Königsbach-Stein]], [[Mönsheim]], [[Neuenbürg]], [[Neuhausen (Enz)|Neuhausen]], [[Neulingen]], [[Niefern-Öschelbronn]], [[Ölbronn-Dürrn]], [[Remchingen]], [[Straubenhardt]], [[Tiefenbronn]], [[Wiernsheim]], [[Wimsheim]] and [[Wurmberg]].

===Neighbouring communities===
The following towns and communities share borderlines with the City of Pforzheim. Below they are mentioned in clockwise order, beginning to the north of the city.

===City wards===
The city of Pforzheim consists of 16 city wards. The communities Büchenbronn, [[Eutingen an der Enz]], Hohenwart, Huchenfeld and Würm, which by way of the latest regional administrative reform during the 1970s were incorporated into Pforzheim's [[Local government|administration]], are represented by independent [[Local government|community councils]] and community administrations. In important matters concerning any of these communities the opinions of the respective community councils must be taken into consideration. However, final decisions on the matter will be made by the Pforzheim [[Municipal council|city council]].

==History==
{{see also|History of Baden-Württemberg}}
{{Prose|section|date=February 2020}}
It was settled by the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] earlier than the current centers of [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]] were. These colonists constructed a [[Ford (river)|ford]] through the river, shortly past the confluence of the three rivers, for their military highway. Due to this strategic location, Pforzheim later became a center for the [[timber rafting|timber-rafting]] trade, which transported timber from the Black Forest via the rivers Wuerm, Nagold, Enz and down the [[Neckar]] and [[Rhine]] to, among other markets, the Netherlands for use in shipbuilding. Their timbers were also used to construct the foundations for [[Amsterdam]], which was built in a swamp.

'''Since 90:''' A settlement was established by Roman citizens at the Enz River near the modern ''Altstädter Brücke'' (old town bridge). Archeological surveys have unearthed several artifacts of that period which are kept and displayed in the Kappelhof Museum. The settlement was located where the Roman military road connecting the military camp [[Argentoratum]] (nowadays [[Strasbourg]] in France) and the military camp at [[Cannstatt]] (now a suburb of [[Stuttgart]]) at the [[Upper Germanic Limes]] border line of the [[Roman Empire]] crossed the [[Enz]] river.

This place was known as ''Portus'' (meaning "river crossing, harbor"), which is believed to be the origin of the first part of the city's name "Pforzheim". A Roman milestone (the so-called 'Leugenstein') from the year 245 was excavated in modern times at present-day [[Friolzheim]]; it is marked with the exact distance to 'Portus' and is the first documented evidence of the settlement.<ref name="history"/><ref>{{cite book|title=Portus - Pforzheim: Untersuchungen zur Archäologie und Geschichte in römischer Zeit|first=Klaus|last=Kortüm|publisher=Verlag Regionalkultur|location=[[Sigmaringen]]|year=1995|isbn=9783897353893|oclc=722345996|language=de}}</ref>

'''259/260:''' The Roman settlement 'Portus' was destroyed completely, as the [[Franks|Frank]] and [[Alemanni]] tribes overran the [[Upper Germanic Limes]] border line of the [[Roman Empire]] and conquered the Roman administered area west of the [[Rhine]] River. From then on, over an extended period of time, historical records about the settlement were not available.<ref name="history"/>

'''6th/7th century:''' Graves from this period indicate that the settlement had been continued.{{r|Becht83|p=41}}

'''1067:''' The settlement was mentioned as "Phorzheim" for the first time, in a document by [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Visits to Pforzheim by Heinrich IV in 1067 and 1074 are documented.{{r|Becht83|p=41}}

'''Before 1080:''' The "old town" of Pforzheim was awarded [[market rights]] (''Marktrecht''). At that time Pforzheim belonged to the estate of [[Hirsau]] [[Monastery]], according to monastery documents.<ref name="history"/>

'''From 1150:''' Establishment of the "new town" west of the "old town" at the foot of the Schlossberg (palais hill) under Margrave [[Hermann V, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Hermann V]].<ref name="history"/>

'''1200:''' The town charter of the "new town" was mentioned for the first time in a document. The "old town" continued to exist as a legally independent entity.<ref name="history"/>

'''1220:''' The [[Rulers of Baden|Margraves of Baden]] selected Pforzheim as their residence. This resulted in the "new town" becoming prominent.

'''1240:''' A mayor of Pforzheim was mentioned in a document for the first time.<ref name="history"/>

'''13th/14th century:''' Pforzheim enjoyed its first period of flourishing. A group of influential [[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patricians]] emerged. They developed the financial markets of those days. The town drew its income from the wood trade, [[timber rafting]], the [[Tanning (leather)|tannery]] trade, [[textile]] manufacturing, and other crafts. Documents mention ''mayor, judge, council and citizens''.

The town walls surrounding the new town were completed about 1290. During this era, three [[Roman Catholic]] [[Holy Orders|orders]] established their [[convents]] in town (the [[Franciscan]] order established their domicile within the town wall at present-day ''Barfuesserkirche'' (the choir of which remains), the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] [[nun|sisters]] order established their domicile outside the walls of the old town near Auer Bridge, and the Prediger cloister was located east of the Schlossberg, probably inside the town walls). Outside the town wall and across the Enz river, the suburb ''Flösser Quarters'' (the home of the timber-floating trade) was established. Next to the western town wall, the suburb of ''Brötzingen'' gradually developed.

The Margraves of Baden considered Pforzheim as their most important power base up to the first half of the 14th century. Under Margrave [[Bernard I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Bernard I]] (Bernhard I), Pforzheim became one of the administrative centers of the margraviate.{{r|Becht83|pp=39-76}}<ref name="Frei">[http://www.loebliche-singer-pforzheim.de/Pforzheim1500.html, Thomas Frei: Pforzheim im 16.

===15th century===
Various [[Guild|fraternities]], also known as guilds, among people working in the same trade were established: The fraternity of [[tailor]]s in 1410, the fraternity of [[baker]]s on 14 May 1422, the fraternity of the [[Weaver (occupation)|weavers]] in 1469, the fraternity of the [[wine-grower]]s in 1491, the fraternity of the [[skipper (boating)|skippers]] and [[timber raftsmen]] in 1501, and the fraternity of the [[carting business|carters]] in 1512. Members of the same fraternity assisted each other in various ways, for example with [[funerals]] and in cases of sickness. In a sense, the fraternities were early forms of health and [[life insurance]].<ref name="Die Pest"/>

'''8–9 August 1418:''' [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]] visits [[Margrave]] [[Bernard I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Bernard I]] (Bernhard I) in Pforzheim. On this occasion the [[Mint (coin)|mint]] of the Margraves of Baden in Pforzheim was mentioned. Mint master was Jakob Broeglin between 1414 and 1431. The emperor appointed the master of the Pforzheim mint, Jakob Bröglin, and Bois von der Winterbach for five years as Royal Mint Masters of the mints of [[Frankfurt]] and [[Nördlingen]]. The Margrave was appointed as their patron.{{r|Becht83|p=172|Frei}}

'''1447:''' The wedding of [[Margrave]] [[Charles I, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Charles I]] (Karl I) of Baden with [[Katharina]] of Austria, the sister of [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor]] (Friedrich III), was celebrated in Pforzheim with great pomp (including [[tournaments]] and [[dances]]).{{r|Becht83|p=223|Groh|Frei}}

[[File:Reuchlin-Gymnasium Pforzheim.jpg|thumb|''Reuchlin-Gymnasium'' (Reuchlin-Highschool) today near the water tower]]
'''1455:''' [[Johannes Reuchlin]], the great German [[Humanism|humanist]], was born in Pforzheim on 29 January (he died in Stuttgart on 30 June 1522). He attended the [[Latin school|Latin School]] section of the monastery school run by the Dominican order of Pforzheim in the late 1460s. Later, partly due to Reuchlin's efforts, the [[Latin school|Latin School]] of Pforzheim developed into one of the most prominent schools in southwestern Germany, named ''[[Reuchlin-Gymnasium]]''. The school's teachers and pupils played an outstanding role in the dissemination of the ideas of [[humanism]] and the [[protestant reformation]] movement. The most famous pupils included Reuchlin himself, Reuchlin's nephew [[Philipp Melanchthon]], and [[Simon Grynaeus]].{{r|Becht89|pp=9-50|Groh}}

'''1460:''' Margrave Charles I established a kind of monastery (Kollegialstift) at the site of Schlosskirche St. Michael, turning the church into a [[collegiate church]]. There were also plans to establish a university in Pforzheim, but this plan had to be abandoned because Margrave Charles I lost the [[Battle of Seckenheim]].{{r|Becht83|pp=107-150|Groh}}

'''1463:''' Margrave Charles I was forced to transfer the palace and the town of Pforzheim as a [[fiefdom]] to the [[Elector Palatine]] after losing the Battle of Seckenheim. He then began to build a new palace in modern [[Baden-Baden]]. [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] finally moved the residence of the margraves to Baden-Baden. This gradually ended the first period of Pforzheim's flourishment. The rich merchants gradually left the town, which declined to the status of a country town of mostly small traders.{{r|Becht83|p=((39-76)), 117|Groh}}

'''1486:''' The ''Weavers Ordinance'' (''Wollweberordnung'') for the towns Pforzheim und [[Ettlingen]] was approved by [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden]]. This was a contract concerning the town privileges of Pforzheim. This regulation of the weaving trade did not allow the formation of a regular [[guild]] (Zunft).{{r|Becht89|pp=117-118|Becht83|pp2=39-76}}

'''1491:''' A contract between [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] and the citizens of Pforzheim was concluded, granting the town of Pforzheim several privileges concerning taxes and business.{{r|Becht89|pp=117-118|Groh}}

'''1496:''' Foundation of the first printer's shop by [[Thomas Anshelm]]. During the first half of the 16th century Pforzheim's printers contributed significantly to the establishment of this (in those days) new medium.<ref name="history"/>

===16th century===
'''1501:''' [[Christoph I, Margrave of Baden-Baden]] enacted the "[[local ordinance|Ordinance]] on the timber rafting profession in Pforzheim". The single timber logs that were floated from the deeper Black Forest areas down the Enz, Nagold and Wuerm rivers were bound together in the Au area to form larger timber rafts. Those rafts were then floated down the lower Enz, Neckar and Rhine rivers. The timber rafting stations of Weissenstein, Dillstein and Pforzheim were well known in the profession.{{r|Groh}}

1501 was also the year for which an outbreak of the plague (probably the [[bubonic plague]]) is recorded in the [[Swabia]]n [[chronicle]] ''Annalium Suevicorum'' by [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen]] professor Martin Grusius, published 1596. It is not known how many of Pforzheim's citizens died in that year, but there are reports of 500 deceased in the close by city of [[Calw]] and about 4000 in [[Stuttgart]], which accounted for approximately one quarter to one half of the populations of those towns. Outbreaks of the disease were reported for many places in southwestern Germany, [[Bohemia]], the [[Alsace]] region in nowadays France, Switzerland, and Italy. [[Mass grave|Common graves]] with massive numbers of human bones at the cemetery of St. Michael Church and the cemetery on the estate of the Dominican order near nowadays Waisenhausplatz found during the last century may indicate that hundreds of citizens became the victims of the plague. There are indications that a [[Fraternal and service organizations|fraternity]] for taking care of the sick and removing the bodies of the deceased from houses was formed in 1501, whose members later on stayed together and became known as the [[choral society]] ''Singergesellschaft'', which is still active today as the ''Loebliche Singergesellschaft of 1501''. (They are probably one of the oldest clubs in Europe).<ref name="Die Pest"/>

'''1520s:''' The ideas of the [[protestant]] [[religious]] movement advanced by [[Martin Luther]] spread rapidly in Pforzheim. Its most prominent promoters were Johannes Schwebel, a preacher at Holy Ghost church (Heiliggeistkirche), and Johannes Unger, the principal of the [[Dominican order|Dominican]] [[Latin school]].<ref name="history"/>

'''1535–1565:''' Due to the [[inheritance|heritage]] division of the clan of the Margraves of Baden, [[Margrave]] [[Ernest, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Ernst of Baden]] made Pforzheim the residential town of his family line. He decided to use the Schlosskirche St. Michael as the entombment site for his family line.<ref name="history"/>

'''1549:''' A large fire caused severe damage to the town.

'''1556:''' After the conclusion of the [[Peace of Augsburg]] in 1555, [[Margrave]] [[Karl II, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Karl II]] introduced ''Lutheranism'' ([[Protestantism]]) as the state religion in the district [[Baden-Durlach]], which included Pforzheim. The (Catholic) monasteries were gradually shut down.<ref name="history"/>

'''1565:''' Margrave Karl II chose Durlach as the new residential town. Pforzheim stayed one of the administrative centers of Baden.<ref name="history"/>

===17th century===
'''1618:''' At the beginning of the [[Thirty Years' War]], the number of inhabitants of Pforzheim is estimated to have been between 2500 and 3000. This was the largest town among all towns in Baden, even though at that time it had already declined somewhat.
[[File:pf meria.jpg|thumb|right|A view of Pforzheim in the early 17th century. It shows all significant landmarks including the city wall, the rivers Enz and Nagold, the three monastery churches and the Margrave's residence on Schlossberg hill.]]

'''1645:''' Toward the end of the Thirty Years' War the "old town" was burned down by [[Bavaria]]n (i.e. Catholic) troops. It was rebuilt, but without the former [[fortifications]], which gave it the status of a village-like settlement. It soon vanished from historical records. The "new town" had survived.<ref name="history"/>

'''1688–1697:''' The "[[War of the Palatinian Succession]]" (also called the [[Nine Years War]]) caused tremendous destruction in Southwestern Germany. The French "sun king" [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]]'s efforts to expand the territory of France up to the Upper Rhine river and to put the [[Elector Palatine]] under pressure to severe its ties with the [[League of Augsburg]] included the ''[[Brûlez le Palatinat!]]'' tactics of destroying major towns on both sides of the Rhine river. These tactics seem to have been mainly the idea of the French war minister, François Michel le Tellier, [[Marquis de Louvois]].

Pforzheim was occupied by French troops on 10 October 1688. Commanding officer is said to have been [[Joseph de Montclar]]. The town was forced to accommodate a large number of soldiers and had to pay a large amount of "contributions" to the French. When the army unit was about to depart early in the morning of 21 January 1689 (obviously because an army of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] had been approaching), they set many major buildings on fire, including the palais, the city hall, and vicarages. About 70 houses (i.e. one quarter of all houses) and part of the town's fortifications were reportedly destroyed.

Between 2 and 4 August, the French army under the general command of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Jacques Henri de Durfort de Duras]] again crossed the Rhine river and began the destruction of major towns in Baden. On 10 August 1689, a French army unit under the command of General [[Ezéchiel du Mas, Comte de Mélac]] appeared in front of Pforzheims town gates, but this time the town refused to surrender. In response, the French army began shelling the town with cannons from the Rod hill located southwest of the town, and the several hundred soldiers of the German imperial command, who were defending the town, were forced to surrender. After a short period of looting, the French troops set the inner town area on fire on 15 August, which made that area uninhabitable for several weeks. Then the French moved on.

During the following two years, French troops stayed away from Pforzheim, but the economic situation of the town was miserable. In addition to this, the reconstruction of the town and the repairs of the fortifications under the supervision of Johann Matthaeus Faulhaber, the chief construction officer of the Margraviate Baden, required a lot of efforts. The accommodation of an imperial garrison under the command of (then) colonel Count [[Palffy]] also was a heavy burden.

In 1691, [[François-Michel le Tellier, Marquis de Louvois|Louvois]] instructed his marshals to destroy those towns which were to serve as winter quarters for imperial troops, explicitly including Pforzheim, and then continue to Wuerttemberg for further destructions. After the French troops had crossed the Rhine river under the command of Marshal [[Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges]] at [[Philippsburg]] on 3 August 1691, they assaulted the Margraves' residential town of [[Durlach]] and 1,200 [[cavalry]] men, 300 [[dragoons]] and 1,200 [[infantry]] men advanced toward Pforzheim where they arrived in the morning on 9 August and surrounded the town. When the approximately 200 imperial soldiers under the command of Captain Zickwolf and other men in the town refused to surrender, the siege began. After shelling the town during the day and the following night, the resistance of the town broke down and on 10 August in the morning the French forced the town gates open, occupied and looted it (although with little success, as there was not much left to be taken away). On 12 August, the French moved on, this time refraining from setting houses on fire. The fortification had again been damaged, though (the White Tower, the Auer Bridge Gate, the Upper Mill and the Nonnen Mill were burnt down). The French also stole all church bells, except for one minor one.

On 20 September 1692, again crossed the Rhine river under the general command of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Guy Aldonce de Durfort de Lorges]], and advanced toward [[Durlach]] and Pforzheim. On 24 September, 2,000 cavalry soldiers and 1,200 infantry and artillery troops under the command of [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Noël Bouton de Chamilly]], moved to Pforzheim, where the town and 600 soldiers of the imperial German army in town surrendered without any military engagements. The rest of the French army arrived on 27 September under the command of Marshal de Lorges. On the same day, the French army moved on to Oetisheim near [[Mühlacker]] and attacked an imperial army unit of 4,000 cavalry men under the command of Duke [[Frederick Charles of Württemberg-Winnental]] in their camp. As they were taken by surprise, they withdrew hastily and lost several hundred men, either killed or captured by the French. (The Duke himself was among the French prisoners.) On 28 September, the French army returned to Pforzheim and established a camp. It was reported that the entire [[Enz]] valley between the village of Eutingen east of Pforzheim and the village of Birkenfeld west of Pforzheim was occupied by the 30,000 French soldiers' camps. From their base in Pforzheim, French army units obviously under the leadership of Marshal de Chamilly advanced along the river valleys of [[Nagold]] and [[Würm (Nagold)|Würm]] and looted and destroyed the villages and towns of Huchenfeld, [[Calw]], [[Hirsau]], [[Liebenzell]] and [[Zavelstein]]. They also destroyed [[Liebeneck castle]] about 10&nbsp;kilometres from Pforzheim towering above the Würm valley, where part of the Pforzheim town archives were hidden. The archive was burned. Another part of the town archive as well as documents of Baden administrative office had been brought to Calw, where they went up in flames, too.

When the French troops left after about one week of occupation, they again looted Pforzheim and put it on fire. This time, all houses which had survived the two previous fires, were destroyed. In the Au suburb, only three houses survived. The Au bridge was heavily damaged. Only four houses survived in the Broetzingen suburb. The town church of St. Stephen and a large part of the Dominican monastery complex were also destroyed. The Castle Church (Schlosskirche) of St. Michael was heavily damaged, and the family tombs of the Margraves of Baden in the church were desecrated by the soldiers. The last remaining church bell and the churches' clockworks were stolen as well. The town wall was damaged again, including the town gates. After the week-long presence of 30,000 soldiers in a town of only a few thousand citizens, all food was gone, including the seeds saved for next spring's sowing season. Every tree and [[grape]]vine on the valley slopes had been used up as firewood. The French army reached their camp in [[Philippsburg]] on 5 October 1692.{{r|Becht89|pp=81-116}}

====World War II====
{{Main|Bombing of Pforzheim in World War II}}
In 1944, many factories were converted to produce weaponry such as anti-aircraft [[shell (projectile)|shells]], [[Fuse (explosives)|fuses]] for bombs, and allegedly even parts for the [[V-1 flying bomb|V-1]] and [[V-2 rocket]]s.

On the evening of 23 February 1945, Pforzheim was bombed in one of the most devastating [[area bombardment]]s of World War II. Carried out by the [[Royal Air Force]],<ref name="history"/> the air raid killed about one quarter of the town's population, over 17,000 people,{{r|Groh}} and destroyed about 83% of the town's buildings.<ref>From RAF website: [http://www.raf.mod.uk/bombercommand/feb45.html Campaign Diary February 1945]</ref> The mission order to bomb Pforzheim issued by [[RAF Bomber Command]] states as the intention of the raid on Pforzheim "to destroy built up area and associated industries and rail facilities".{{r|Groh}} The bombardment was carried out as part of the British [[carpet bombing]] campaign. The town was put on the target list for bombardments in November 1944 because it was thought by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] to be producing precision instruments for use in the German war effort and as transport centre for the movement of German troops.{{efn|Pforzheim is situated in a valley and also spread out across the adjacent hill slopes. On the northern slope there is a level, narrow plateau that is about 100&nbsp;meters wide and about 2&nbsp;kilometers in length. The railway facilities, including the main station and what used to be the freight loading facilities, are located on this plateau. This is the only level space that can possibly be used for railway facilities there. If the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] would have been only aiming at destroying the railway facilities, a few aircraft would have sufficed to finish this job in a short time. There was no need to bomb an area that was wider than one kilometer ({{convert|1|km|1|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) and had a length of more than three kilometers ({{convert|3|km|1|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) using more than 360 [[Avro Lancaster|Lancasters]], as was the case in the big raid on 23 February. The existence and size of the plateau on the northern slope can be verified by examining any topographic map featuring the Pforzheim city area, and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705101909/http://www.pforzheim.de/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/BILDER/CHRONIK/ZERSTOERUNGSKARTE.PDF map showing the destroyed city area]. And besides that, the area bombardment obviously was not even effective in destroying the railway facilities, because less than one month after the big raid in mid-March the railway facilities were bombed again several times by the [[USAF]], this time focussing mainly on the suspected military target, not civilian estates.<ref name="Zeitung52"/>}}

There were also several minor raids in 1944 and 1945.<ref name="Zeitung52">{{cite news|last=Frei|first=Thomas|title=Beim Milchholen aus Flugzeugen beschossen|trans-title=Shot at while fetching milk from planes|department=23.Februar 1945|work=[[Pforzheimer Zeitung]]|date=2005-03-04|issue=52|page=20|language=de|format=PDF|url=http://www.pz-news.de/specials/web/pdf/pforzheim/2005/download.dhtml?command=32|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310193913/http://www.pz-news.de/specials/web/pdf/pforzheim/2005/download.dhtml?command=32|archive-date=2005-03-10}}</ref>

The inner-city districts were severely depopulated. According to the State Statistics Bureau (''Statistisches Landesamt''), in the Market Square area (''Marktplatzviertel'') in 1939 there were 4,112 registered inhabitants, in 1945 none (0). In the Old Town area (''Altstadtviertel'') in 1939 there were 5,109 inhabitants, in 1945 only three persons were still living there. In the Leopold Square area, in 1939 there were 4,416 inhabitants, in 1945 only 13.{{efn|These figures are similar to {{harvp|Groh|2005}}, but must be from another source which is not recorded.}}

The German Army Report of 24 February 1945 devoted only two lines to reporting the bombardment: "In the early evening hours of February 23, a forceful British attack was directed at Pforzheim." [[RAF Bomber Command]] later assessed the bombing raid as the one with "probably the greatest proportion (of destroyed built-up area) (of any target) in one raid during the war".<ref>{{cite news|author=PM|title=Sofortmeldung nach dem Angriff|trans-title=Immediate report after the attack|department=23.Februar 1945|work=[[Pforzheimer Zeitung]]|date=2005-02-23|issue=44|pages=22–23|language=de|format=PDF|url=http://www.pz-news.de/specials/web/pdf/pforzheim/2005/download.dhtml?command=26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050310193755/http://www.pz-news.de/specials/web/pdf/pforzheim/2005/download.dhtml?command=26|archive-date=2005-03-10}}</ref>

In early April, as the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and the [[French Army]] advanced toward Pforzheim, the local German military commander gave orders to destroy the electric power generating plant and those gas and water supply lines that were still working, but local residents succeeded in persuading the [[staff sergeant]] in charge of the operation to refrain from this action in the face of the imminent and seemingly inevitable surrender of the German military. Likewise, orders were issued for the destruction of those bridges that had remained unscathed (some of the bridges had been destroyed by the air strikes of 23 February, others damaged or destroyed earlier in the war). Only the Iron (Railway) Bridge in Weißenstein ward was saved by citizens who pulled off the [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]] wiring from the explosive devices which had already been installed, and dropped it into Nagold river. On 8 April, French troops, including an [[armored vehicle]] unit, moved into Pforzheim from the northwest, and were able to occupy the area north of Enz river, but the area south of the Enz river was defended by a German [[infantry]] unit using [[artillery]]. Fighting was especially fierce in Broetzingen. The French army units (including an [[Algeria]]n and [[Morocco|Moroccan]] unit) suffered heavy losses; among the dead was the commander of the army unit, Capitaine Dorance. The advance of the French army came to a halt temporarily, but with the support of fighter-bomber aircraft and due to the bad condition of the defenders - which included many old men and young boys who had been drafted into the [[Volkssturm]] - the French troops took possession of the vast rubble field which once was the a residential town of the Baden Margraves on 18 April.<ref>{{cite news|last=Frei|first=Thomas|title=Beherzte Bürger retten Weißensteiner Brücke|trans-title=Courageous citizens save Weißenstein bridge|department=23.Februar 1945|work=[[Pforzheimer Zeitung]]|date=2005-03-31|issue=73|page=20|language=de|format=PDF|url=http://www.pz-news.de/specials/web/pdf/pforzheim/2005/download.dhtml?command=38|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051112004501/http://www.pz-news.de/specials/web/pdf/pforzheim/2005/download.dhtml?command=38|archive-date=2005-11-12}}</ref><ref name="Zeitung24">{{cite news|last=Frei|first=Thomas|title=Zehn Tage um "tote Stadt" gekämpft|trans-title=Ten days fighting over "dead city"|department=23.Februar 1945|work=[[Pforzheimer Zeitung]]|date=2005-04-08|issue=80|page=24|language=de|format=PDF|url=http://www.pz-news.de/specials/web/pdf/pforzheim/2005/download.dhtml?command=39|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051109215004/http://www.pz-news.de/specials/web/pdf/pforzheim/2005/download.dhtml?command=39|archive-date=2005-11-09}}</ref>

The three months of French [[Military occupation|occupation]] were reportedly marked by hostile attitudes on both the French army side and the Pforzheim population's side; incidents of rape and looting, mainly by Moroccan soldiers, were also reported.{{citation needed|date=April 2021}} Au Bridge (''Auerbruecke'') and Wuerm Bridge received makeshift repairs by the French military. The [[United States Army|US Army]], which replaced the French troops on 8 July 1945, helped repair Goethe Bridge, Benckiser Bridge, Old Town Bridge (''Altstädterbrücke'') and Horse Bridge (''Roßbrücke'') in 1945 and the following year. The relationship between the population and the US military was reportedly more relaxed than had been the case with the French army.<ref name="Zeitung24"/>

Across the town between Buechenbronn ward and the village of Wurmberg the storm caused severe damage to forest areas (i.e. most trees fell to the ground). During the first night and the following days the soldiers of the French 3rd Husar Regiment and the US Army Unit, which were still stationed at the Buckenberg Barracks, helped clear the streets of a lot of fallen trees (especially in the Buckenberg/Haidach area). It took about four weeks to carry out the most necessary repairs on buildings.

The population growth diagram show that the largest growth rates were recorded between about 1830 and 1925, which was the period following the political reorganisation of Europe agreed upon at the [[Vienna Congress]] of 1815 after the violent period that was so much dominated by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] of France. This high population growth period coincided with the period of intensive [[industrialisation]] of Germany. Population growth weakened due to the effects of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. The population declined sharply due to the destruction on 23 February 1945, and increased sharply in the post-World War II era due to high economic growth levels in West-Germany and the rapid rebuilding efforts in Pforzheim. Earlier setbacks were recorded during the [[Thirty Years' War]] period in the 17th century.

===Religions===
After margrave [[Karl II, Margrave of Baden-Durlach|Karl II of Baden]] in 1556 installed the [[Protestant Reformation]] in the [[Margraviate of Baden]], of which Pforzheim was the capital in those days, Pforzheim continued to be a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] town for several centuries. The congregations in Pforzheim were affiliated with the deanery (Dekanat) of Pforzheim of the Protestant [[National Church of Baden]], unless they were members of one of the independent churches ([[Freikirche]]).

Since the 19th century at the latest [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] settled in Pforzheim again. They are affiliated with the deanery of Pforzheim, which belongs to the [[Archdiocese of Freiburg]].

Other denominations and religious sects in Pforzheim are:
* [[Israelite Congregation]]
* [[Islamic Congregation]]
* [[Adventism|Adventist Congregation]]

==Politics==
===City council===
The [[Municipal council|city council]] of Pforzheim consists of the ''Oberbürgermeister'' (mayor) as its president and 40 elected (part-time) councillors. It is democratically elected by the citizens for a period of five years. The last election was on 26 May 2019. The city council is the main representative body of the city and determines the goals and frameworks for all local political activities. It makes decisions about all important issues regarding the public life and administration of the city and directs and monitors the work of the city administration. It forms expert committees in order to deal with specialized issues.

===Lord mayors===
At an early stage, the town administration was led by the [[mayor]] (''[[Schultheiss]]'') who used to be appointed by the lord (owner) of the town. Later on, there was a council with a mayor leading it, who since 1849 holds the title "Oberbürgermeister". The terms of office of the mayors until 1750 are unknown. Only the names of the mayors are mentioned in historical documents.

===The coat of arms===
[[File:Wappen Pforzheim.svg|150px|thumb|right|Coat of arms of Pforzheim]]
The [[coat of arms]] of Pforzheim city shows in the left-hand half of a shield an inclined bar in red color on a golden background, and the right-hand half is divided into four fields in the colors red, silver, blue and gold. The city flag is white-blue.

The inclined bar can be traced back to the 13th century as the symbol of the lords (owners) of Pforzheim, which later on also became the National Coat of Arms of Baden, but its meaning is unknown. Since 1489 the coat of arms in its entire form can be verified, but its meaning is not known, either. Current coloring has been used only since 1853; in earlier times the coloring was different.{{r|Becht83|pp=221-238}}

==Economy and infrastructure==
Pforzheim is one of the [[regional center]]s (Oberzentrum) in [[Baden-Württemberg]] and has one of the highest densities of industrial activity in the state.

Pforzheim is historically an important jewelry and watch-making centre in Germany. Due to this reason, Pforzheim is nicknamed as Golden City. Jewelry and watch-making industry is first set up by [[Jean François Autran]] after receiving an edict from then overlord [[Margrave Karl Friedrich von Baden]].<ref name="invest1">{{cite web |author=Baden-Württemberg. Where ideas work. |url=http://www.bw-invest.de/eng/index_eng_1386.aspx |title=Baden-Württemberg. Where ideas work. - Pforzheim, Goldstadt Deutschlands |publisher=Bw-invest.de |date=17 June 2006 |access-date=6 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014215727/http://www.bw-invest.de/eng/index_eng_1386.aspx |archive-date=14 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This enterprise is later joined by other commercial enterprises and helped Pforzheim to become an important manufacturing city. Pforzheim accounts for just under 70 percent of the total sales of the German jewelry and silverware industry and around 80 percent of all the pieces of jewelry exported by Germany come from Pforzheim.

However, a smaller fraction of the economy nowadays is dedicated to producing the traditional products of [[watches]] and [[jewellery]]. Only 11,000 people are employed in the jewelry and watch-making industries.<ref name="invest1"/> Two thirds of all employment positions are made available in the areas of metal processing, dental industry electronics and [[electro-technology]]. The [[mail order]] companies (Bader, Klingel, Wenz) with their sales volumes in the order of millions of Euros occupies a leading position in Germany. [[Tourism]] is gaining importance. In this respect the city benefits from its favorable Three-Valleys location at the gateway to the Black Forest, and related to this, from the starting points of a large number of hiking, cycling and waterway routes. The [[European long-distance paths|European long-distance trail]] [[European walking route E1|E1]] passes through Pforzheim. It is also the starting point of the [[Black Forest Hiking Routes]] [[Westweg]], [[Mittelweg]] and [[Ostweg]].

===Transport===
Pforzheim is located on the [[Karlsruhe–Mühlacker railway|Karlsruhe–Mühlacker line]], part of the legacy railway between Karlsruhe and Stuttgart. [[Pforzheim Hauptbahnhof]], the central station, is a junction station, as two [[Black Forest]] branch lines start here: the [[Enz Valley Railway]] to [[Bad Wildbad]], and the [[Nagold Valley Railway]] to [[Calw]], [[Nagold]] and [[Horb am Neckar|Horb]]. Since the 1990s, the [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn|Karlsruhe tram-train]] system has been extended to Pforzheim: since 2019, the local service to [[Karlsruhe]] is the S5 tram-train continuing into Karlsruhe city centre and [[Wörth am Rhein]]. In addition, tram-train S6 links Pforzheim via the Enz Valley Railway with the town centre of Bad Wildbad. In addition to tram-trains, regional trains operated by [[Go-Ahead Baden-Württemberg]], [[SWEG Bahn Stuttgart]] and [[DB Regio Baden Württemberg|DB Regio Baden-Württemberg]] offer connections to Karlsruhe, [[Mühlacker]], [[Bietigheim-Bissingen]] and [[Stuttgart]] (routes IRE1 and MEX17a), as well as to [[Tübingen]] via Calw (RB73). Also, some [[Intercity (Deutsche Bahn)|Intercity]] trains operated by [[Deutsche Bahn]] serve Pforzheim on its Karlsruhe-Stuttgart-[[Nuremberg]] route.

Local bus service in Pforzheim is currently franchised to [[DB Regio Bus|DB Südwestbus]], operating 13 urban bus routes. In addition, there are regional bus services to surrounding places.

All regional trains, tram-trains and buses within Pforzheim and the surrounding Enzkreis are marketed under the brand of the ''[[Verkehrsverbund Pforzheim-Enzkreis]]'' (VPE), offering mutually integrated fares.

Between 1900 and 1968 a [[Pforzheim Light Railway|metre-gauge light railway]] existed between Pforzheim and [[Ittersbach]], connected there to the still existing [[Busenbach–Ittersbach railway]].

The [[Bundesautobahn 8|A8 Autobahn]] ([[Perl, Germany|Perl]]–[[Bad Reichenhall]]) runs by just to the north of the city. The city can be accessed via four A8 exits. In addition, the [[Bundesstraße 10|B10]] ([[Lebach]]–[[Augsburg]]) and [[Bundesstraße 294|B294]] ([[Gundelfingen]]–[[Bretten]]) and [[Bundesstraße 463|B463]] (Pforzheim–[[Nagold]]) run through the city.

The Pforzheim School of Design had its roots in the Ducal Academy of Arts and Crafts and Technical School for the Metal Processing Industry, established 1877. The Pforzheim Business School was the successor institution of the National Business College, which was established in 1963. The campuses of the Faculty of Design and the Faculties of Economics and Engineering are located at separate sites in the city area. The Pforzheim University of Applied Sciences fosters international exchange. Among other relationships, it is affiliated with the NIEBES Association and has close academic ties to [[Osijek]] University of [[Croatia]] and academic exchange programs with many institutions abroad, among them [[Auburn University]], the [[University of Wyoming]], [[Brigham Young University]] and the [[Illinois Institute of Technology]], in Chicago, of the United States of America.
