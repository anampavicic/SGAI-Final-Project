==History==
Emigrants from [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]] settled near present-day Richardson in the 1840s. Before the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], a small settlement called Breckenridge, located near present-day [[Richland College]], was established. In 1873, the [[Houston and Texas Central Railway]] built a depot northwest of Breckenridge. After the H.&T.C. purchased acreage for a townsite from two local land-owners, the site was surveyed and laid out in blocks and lots, which the railroad began selling in 1874. The town was named after the secretary of the Houston & Texas Central Railroad, Alfred S. Richardson.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Butler |first1=Steven R. |title=A Sesquicentennial History of Richardson, Texas, Vol. 1, Rural Roots |date=2022 |publisher=Poor Scholar Publications |location=Richardson, Texas |isbn=978-1737948018 |pages=77–79,93–96,106 |edition=First}}</ref>

In 1908, the [[Texas Electric Railway]], an [[electric railway]] known as the Interurban, connected Richardson to [[Denison, Texas|Denison]], [[Waco, Texas|Waco]], [[Corsicana, Texas|Corsicana]] and [[Dallas]]. In 1910 the population was approximately 600. A red brick schoolhouse was built in 1914 and is now the administrative office for the Richardson Independent School District. In 1924 the Red Brick Road, the present-day [[Lower Greenville, Dallas, Texas|Greenville Avenue]], was completed. The completion of the road brought increased traffic, population and property values. The town incorporated and elected a mayor in 1925. In 1940 the population was approximately 740.

After World War II the city experienced major increases in population, which stood at approximately 1,300 by 1950. Throughout the 1950s the city continued to see growth including the opening of the [[Rockwell Collins|Collins Radio]] Richardson office, [[Central Expressway (Dallas)|Central Expressway]], a police department, shopping centers, and many homes. [[Texas Instruments]] opened its offices in Dallas on the southern border of Richardson in 1956. This was followed by significant gains in land values, population, and economic status. In the 1960s Richardson experienced additional growth including several new parks, facilities, and the creation of the [[University of Texas at Dallas]] within the city limits. By 1972 the population was approximately 56,000. Residential growth continued through the 1970s and slowed in the 1980s. Commercial development increased throughout the 1980s. Richardson had a population of 74,840 according to the 1990 census. Population increases throughout the 1990s were primarily from development of the northeast part of the city. The city of [[Buckingham, Texas|Buckingham]], after being completely surrounded by Richardson, was annexed into the city in 1996.

Richardson had a population of 91,802 as of the 2000 census. By 2002 Richardson had four [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) [[DART light rail|light rail]] stations and had built the [[Charles W. Eisemann Center for Performing Arts|Eisemann Center for Performing Arts and Corporate Presentations]] and the adjacent [[Galatyn Park Station|Galatyn Park]] urban center, which has a 2-acre public pedestrian plaza, a luxury hotel, and mixed-use development. Richardson was a [[Dry county|"dry city"]] with no alcohol sales until November 2006, when the local option election passed to allow the sale of beer and wine in grocery and convenience stores. In the fall of 2008 Peter Perfect, a [[Style Network]] television show, came to Richardson. The business-makeover show remodeled SpiritWear, an apparel and embroidery store in the city's historic downtown area. The episode first aired on January 22, 2009. It was the first episode of the series to be filmed outside of [[California]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.richardsontexas.org/about.aspx|title=Richardson Convention & Visitors Bureau|website=www.richardsontexas.org|access-date=20 March 2018}}</ref><ref>[http://www.dfw.com/105/story/88172.html DFW.com, SpiritWear, TV makeover]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}</ref>

The city's total assessed property value went up from $8.3 billion in 2005 to $14 billion in 2017. Sales tax collection went up from $21 million in 2005 to an estimated $32.9 million in 2017.

Since 2008, both [[Standard & Poor's]] and [[Moody's]] have upgraded Richardson's credit rating to "AAA" from the previous rating of "AA+". At the time, Richardson was one of only four cities in the state of Texas and one of 88 cities in the nation with an "AAA" rating from Standard & Poor's. In 2015, the [[North Central Texas Council of Governments]] (NCTCOG) determined Richardson's daytime population to be 156,065 based on American Community Survey information.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://rdc.nctcog.org/Members/ServiceGroup.aspx?id=15|title=Research and Information Services - Regional Data Center|website=rdc.nctcog.org|access-date=2017-06-20}}</ref> The economy remains rooted in the telecommunication industry. However, Richardson's property tax base is deep and extends beyond its telecommunication roots to include other sectors including insurance, health care, technology and finance. The tax base is diverse with the 10 leading taxpayers accounting for 16.17% of total assessed value.

On March 1, 2014, the Richardson Fire Department officially received its Class 1 ISO rating. The [[Insurance Services Office]] (ISO) is "a leading supplier of statistical, underwriting and actuarial information for the property/casualty insurance industry", and its rating is used to measure the quality and effectiveness of fire protection in a community. At the time, Richardson was one of only 56 municipalities in the country to achieve this highest rating, which tends to reduce property/casualty insurance premiums.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cor.net/index.aspx?page=1955 |title=City of Richardson, TX : ISO 1 Rating |access-date=2019-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107030114/https://www.cor.net/index.aspx?page=1955 |archive-date=2017-11-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

==Arts and culture==

The [[Charles W. Eisemann Center for Performing Arts]] is located in Richardson. It serves as the primary venue for the [[Richardson Symphony Orchestra]] and the [[Plano Symphony Orchestra]].

==Government==
Richardson was originally incorporated in 1925, with the first Charter being adopted in 1956 and the latest revision made in November 2015. The community is a home rule city and has operated under the [[Council–manager government|council–manager form of government]] since 1956.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cor.net/index.aspx?page=112|title=City of Richardson, TX : City Council|website=www.cor.net|access-date=2017-06-20}}</ref> Richardson voters simultaneously elect six Council members and a mayor to represent them every two years. The Council members representing the four districts (1 to 4) must live in each district respectively; however, the mayor and the remaining two districts (5 and 6) can live in any part of the city. All Council members and the mayor are elected at large, with four Council members representing each of the city's four districts. The City Council is elected for two-year terms on a nonpartisan basis.

The Charter requires that the City Council appoint a city manager to act as the chief administrative and executive officer. The city manager is not appointed for a fixed time and may be removed at the will and pleasure of the majority of the City Council. One of the responsibilities of the city manager is to appoint and remove department heads and conduct the general affairs of the municipal government in accordance with the policies of the City Council.

The City provides to its citizens a full range of services including police and fire protection, emergency ambulance service, water and sewer service, solid waste disposal, park and recreational activities, cultural events, and a library. In addition, the City provides planning for future land use, traffic control, building inspection, and community services and operates two 18-hole golf courses. The City also operates the [[Charles W. Eisemann Center for Performing Arts|Charles W. Eisemann Center for Performing Arts and Corporate Presentations]], which is a multi-venue performing arts and presentation center.

The City of Richardson is a voluntary member of [[North Central Texas Council of Governments|the North Central Texas Council of Governments]] (NCTCOG) association, the purpose of which is to coordinate individual and collective local governments and facilitate regional solutions, eliminate unnecessary duplication, and enable joint decisions.

===Public libraries===
The Richardson Public Library is located at 900 Civic Center Drive at the southwest corner of [[U.S. Route 75]] (North Central Expressway) and Arapaho Road.<ref>"[https://www.cor.net/libraryfaq.aspx?id=5244 Library Location] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081228055147/http://www.cor.net/libraryfaq.aspx?id=5244 |date=2008-12-28 }}." ''City of Richardson''. Retrieved on February 7, 2009.</ref>

The roots of the Richardson Public Library date back to 1947 when a branch of the Dallas County Library was established in a section of the Cash Dry Goods store on East Main Street in downtown Richardson. The fledgling library collection numbered about 400 volumes and was managed by Jessie Durham the store's proprietor. The City Council established the library as a city department in 1958 and in 1959 the library moved into a newly constructed building at 310 Tyler Street. This new library was just under {{convert|6000|sqft|m2}} in size and was built at a cost of $100,000.<ref name="Library History">[https://www.cor.net/LibraryFAQ.aspx?id=5228 Library History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324041932/http://www.cor.net/LibraryFAQ.aspx?id=5228 |date=2009-03-24 }}</ref>

Richardson was experiencing rapid growth in the 1960s and 1970s, and the library facility soon became inadequate for community needs. The current facility was constructed at a cost of $2 million and opened December 1, 1970. The new {{convert|81650|sqft|m2|adj=on}}, four-story building opened with the use of two floors and a small portion of a third.<ref>[https://www.cor.net/LibraryFAQ.aspx?id=5228 Richardson TX: Public Library<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324041932/http://www.cor.net/LibraryFAQ.aspx?id=5228 |date=2009-03-24 }}</ref> The basement was finished in 1980 for the reference collection and services. In 1995 the library underwent another expansion which finished the upper floor and renovated the three previously opened floors. Another renovation occurred in 2006 when the Youth Services department was expanded.<ref name="Library History"/>

In 2008 the library set a new record for the number of items circulated in a fiscal year when the 1 millionth item was checked out in the fall of 2008. The building has undergone building renovations and technological improvements in recent years that have enhanced the library experience for patrons. Since 2014, the digital library has expanded to include movies, music and magazines as well as books and [[audiobook]]s. In 2015, the Richardson Library established a "makerspace" that initially included a 3-D printer, designated computers with creative applications and software, and kits for the early exploration of electronics.

The Texas Municipal League recognized the library with its "Achievement of Excellence in Libraries" award every year from 2004 to 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cor.net/departments/public-library/faq/about-richardson-public-library|title = About Richardson Public Library &#124; Richardson, TX}}</ref>

==Transportation==
[[File:Richardson August 2019 25 (Galatyn Park Station).jpg|thumb|A [[DART light rail]] [[Red Line (DART)|Red Line]] train at [[Galatyn Park station]] in Richardson]]
Richardson and the region benefit from the location of two major highways in the city. The [[President George Bush Turnpike]], running east–west along the northern border of the city, provides a convenient connection to the [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|Dallas Fort Worth International Airport]], as well as links to [[Interstate 35E (Texas)|IH 35E]], [[Interstate 30|IH 30]], [[Interstate 20 in Texas|IH20]], [[Texas State Highway 114|SH 114]], and [[Texas State Highway 183|SH 183]] west of the city as well as a second link to [[Interstate 30|IH30]] east of the city.

Richardson also benefits from the [[Dallas Area Rapid Transit]] (DART) Light Rail line which parallels [[U.S. Route 75|U.S. 75]] and has four stations in the city. In October 2016, DART approved the future construction of the [[Silver Line (DART)|Silver Line]] [[commuter rail]] with the adoption of its 20-Year Financial Plan. Service on the Cotton Belt is projected to commence in 2025. The Cotton Belt line will run from [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport|DFW Airport]] to the eastern side of Plano, with Richardson stations located at The [[University of Texas at Dallas]] and CityLine. The Cotton Belt rail line will also connect to [[Trinity Metro]]'s [[TEXRail|TEXRail line]], which connects downtown [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] to the DFW Airport. In order to take full advantage of these transportation assets for development and redevelopment purposes, the City has implemented three [[Tax increment financing|Tax Increment Financing]] (TIF) Districts. TIF District #1 was established in November 2006, encompassing both sides of the U.S. 75 corridor from Campbell Road south to Spring Valley Road, and then extending west from U.S. 75 along Spring Valley Road to Coit Road. TIF District #2, established in November 2011, is bounded by [[President George Bush Turnpike]] on the north, Wyndham Lane on the east, Renner Road on the south, and the DART light rail line on the west. TIF District #3, established in November 2011, is bounded by President George Bush Turnpike on the north, the DART light rail line on the east, Renner Road on the South and has its western boundary between Alma Road and U.S. 75. Dallas County participates financially in TIF District #1 and Collin County participates financially in TIF District #2 and TIF District #3.

===Central Trail===
[[File:Richardson August 2019 42 (Central Trail).jpg|thumb|Central Trail]]
The southern Central Trail extension opened in June 2014 and the northern extension opened in 2015. The new hike and bike trail segments mean that the central spine to Richardson's trail network will run from city limit to city limit, eventually connecting to trails throughout the region.

===Bike lanes===
In July 2015, Richardson was named a Bronze Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cor.net/index.aspx?page=73&recordid=1750|title=City of Richardson, TX : News List : Richardson Named A Bronze Level Bicycle Friendly Community by the League of American Bicyclists|website=www.cor.net|access-date=2017-06-21}}</ref> Richardson has a long-range plan to provide bicycle facilities and to designate preferred bicycle routes on lower-volume, lower-speed roadways.
