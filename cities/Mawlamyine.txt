== Etymology and legend ==

Moulmein was also spelled as ''Maulmain or Moulmain or Maulmein'' in some records of the 19th century. The people of Moulmein were referred as ''Moulmeinian.''<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/memoirofgeorgeed00cottrich|title=Memoir of George Edward Lynch Cotton, D.D., Bishop of Calcutta, and Metropolitan : with selections from his journals and correspondence|last1=Cotton|first1=Sophia Anne|last2=Cotton|first2=George Edward Lynch|date=1871|publisher=London : Longmans, Green|others=University of California Libraries}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Moulmein-and-river.jpg|thumb|left|Moulmein and the mouth of the Thanlwin River in the early-1900s]]

=== Early history ===
==== Early Mon reigns ====
According to [[Kalyani Inscriptions]] erected by King [[Dhammazedi]] of [[Hanthawaddy Kingdom|Hanthawaddy Pegu]] in 1479, Mawlamyine was mentioned among the ‘32 myo’ or thirty-two [[Mon people|Mon]] cities within the Martaban division.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The 32 myos in the medieval Mon kingdom|last=Shorto|first=H L|publisher=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|year=1963|pages=575}}</ref> Binnya U, a deputy of Viceroy [[Saw Binnya]], was one of the notable governors of Mawlamyine in the early history of the city.

==== Toungoo dynasty ====
In May 1541, King [[Tabinshwehti]] and his deputy [[Bayinnaung]] captured Mawlamyine.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A History of Burma|last=Aung|first=Htin|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1967|location=New York and London|pages=106}}</ref> During the reign of Bayinnaung, [[First Toungoo Empire|Toungoo Empire]] became the largest empire in the history of [[Southeast Asia]]. After his passing in 1581, his son [[Nanda Bayin]] and successors faced with rebellion by [[Lan Na]], [[Siam]], [[Lan Xang]] and renewed Portuguese incursions. In 1594, the governor of Mawlamyine who being in league with Siamese King [[Naresuan]] revolted against Toungoo court.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Our Wars With the Burmese|last=Rajanubhab|first=Damrong|publisher=White Lotus|year=2001|isbn=9747534584|location=Bangkok,Thailand|pages=145–147}}</ref> Since then, the city became under the control of Siam (present-day [[Thailand]]) until 1614.

==== Konbaung dynasty ====
In 1760, General [[Minkhaung Nawrahta]] of the [[Royal Burmese Army]] repaired Mawlamyine on his way back from [[Burmese–Siamese War (1759–60)|Burmese–Siamese War]] in [[Ayutthaya (city)|Ayutthaya]] (former capital of Thailand). Kyaikthanlan Pagoda Inscription hinted that in 1764 (1125 ME), General [[Maha Nawrahta]] repaired Kyaikthanlan Pagoda on his way to capture [[Dawei|Tavoy]], and before finishing the repairment, Mawlamyine faced utter destruction.

=== Colonial Moulmein (1824–1948) ===
Mawlamyine was the [[List of capitals of Myanmar|first capital]] of [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]] between 1826 and 1852 after the [[Tanintharyi Region|Tanintharyi]] (Tenassarim) coast, along with [[Rakhine State|Arakan]], was ceded to [[British Empire|Britain]] under the [[Treaty of Yandabo]] at the end of the [[First Anglo-Burmese War]].<ref name=EB>{{Cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/394523/Moulmein|title=Moulmein|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] online|access-date=2009-02-03}}</ref> After the first Anglo-Burmese war, the British made it their capital between 1826 and 1852, building government offices, churches and a massive prison.In 1829, the Moulmein Bar Association was founded by the Barristers in Mawlamyine.They started business enterprises and the country's first newspaper, ''[[Media of Myanmar|The Maulmain Chronicle]]''.<ref name="Moulmein, Myanmar">{{Cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/03/09/mawlamyine-myanmar-travel/|title=Moulmein, Myanmar|access-date=2017-06-12|date=2017-03-09}}</ref> Between 1826 and 1862, colonial Mawlamyine was the center of British Burma and the first [[port city]] that became a strategically important area and a geographical nodal point for the newly occupied British territory in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Port Cities as Nodal Points of Change|last=McPherson|first=Kenneth|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2002|pages=75–95}}</ref> Ever since the first British occupation in 1824, the growth and prosperity of Mawlamyine had steadily increased due to timber trade. Nevertheless, the decline in prosperity of Mawlamyine began when the supply of marketable timber from Salween Valley started to decrease in the 1890s.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/wanderingsinbur00birdgoog|title=Wanderings in Burma|last=Bird|first=George W.|date=1897|publisher=Bournemouth [Eng.] F.J.

During British colonial times, [[Germany]], [[Thailand|Siam]], [[Iran|Persia]], [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]] opened and maintained [[consulate]]s in Mawlamyine led by either [[Consul (representative)|consuls]] or vice-consuls while [[Italy]] and [[Consulate General of the United States, Kolkata|the United States]] placed consular agencies in Mawlamyine.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://theodora.com/encyclopedia/m2/moulmein.html|title=Moulmein - Encyclopedia|website=theodora.com|access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/cc0e6ced-2771-4e8d-ac5f-be907d6139b7|title=The Discovery Service|last=Archives|first=The National|website=discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abldirectories.weebly.com/1888-moulmein.html|title=1888 Moulmein|website=ABL Directories|access-date=2017-10-11}}</ref> [[Germans|German]] explorer [[Johann Wilhelm Helfer]]'s landing at Moulmein shore on 8 February 1837 made him as the first German to arrive Burma in the history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/travelsofdoctorm02nost|title=Travels of Doctor and Madame Helfer in Syria, Mesopotamia, Burmah and other lands|last1=Nostitz|first1=Pauline|last2=Sturge|first2=G.

Mawlamyine was the setting of [[George Orwell]]'s famous 1936 essay ''[[Shooting an Elephant]]'', which was inspired by Orwell's posting to the city as a police officer in 1926.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Taylor |first=David John |title=Orwell: the new life |date=2023 |publisher=Constable |isbn=978-1-4721-3295-6 |location=London}}</ref> The story, which is most likely a mixture of fact and fiction,<ref name=":0" /> opens with the striking words:
:"In Moulmein, in [[Lower Burma]], I was hated by large numbers of people—the only time in my life that I have been important enough for this to happen to me."

During colonial times, Moulmein had a substantial [[Anglo-Burmese]] population. An area of the city was known as "Little [[England]]" due to the large Anglo-Burmese community, many of them running rubber plantations. This has since dwindled to a handful of families as most have left for the UK or Australia.

It was probably best known to [[English language|English]] speakers through the opening lines of [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem ''[[Mandalay (poem)|Mandalay]]'':
:"By the old Moulmein pagoda, lookin' lazy at the sea
:There's a Burma girl a-settin', and I know she thinks o' me".

During [[WWII]], the city and the [[Tanintharyi Region]] were the first objectives during the [[Japanese invasion of Burma]].<ref name="la">{{cite book |last1=Allen |first1=Louis |title=Burma: The Longest War 1941-45 |date=1984 |publisher=Phoenix Press |location=London |isbn=9781842122600 |pages=31–35}}</ref>

=== Contemporary Mawlamyine ===
Soon after Burma's independence in 1948, the city fell into the hands of [[Karen National Defence Organisation|Karen insurgents]]. The [[Tatmadaw|Myanmar military]] retook the city with the help of [[UBS Mayu]] in 1950.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Union of Burma|last=Tinker|first=Hugh|pages=325}}</ref> Later, many colonial names of streets and parks of the city were changed to more nationalistic Burmese names. Mawlamyine stood as the third-largest city of Myanmar until the recent rise of [[Naypyidaw]].

==Geography==
[[Image:Mawlamyine-1.jpg|thumb|left|Shampoo Island near Mawlamyine.]]

Mawlamyine is in the [[Salween River]] [[river delta|delta]], where the mouth of the Salween is sheltered by Bilugyun Island as it enters the [[Gulf of Martaban]] and the [[Andaman Sea]]. It is flanked by low hills dotted with ancient pagodas to the east and west.<ref name=EB/>

===Climate===
Mawlamyine has a [[tropical monsoon climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Am'') similar to the climates of [[Dawei]] and [[Sittwe]]. There is a lengthy [[dry season]] between mid-November and mid-April, and an extremely [[wet season]] due to the southwest monsoon between mid-April and mid-November. Between June and August when the surface westerly winds are strongest and supersaturated air is advected onto the nearby mountains, Mawlamyine averages around {{convert|1100|mm|in|0|disp=or}} of rain per month.

[[Mawlamyine Railway Station]], which was reportedly built to the standards of an "[[ASEAN]] railway station", is the terminus of [[Myanmar Railways]]' [[Yangon–Mawlamyine Railway]] and [[Tanintharyi Line]].

=== Water transport ===
In [[British rule in Burma|colonial era]], Mawlamyine (then Moulmein) port was served by European shipping companies including [[Scottish people|Scottish]]-owned [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]] and [[Irrawaddy Flotilla Company]]. 
[[File:A and J Inglis SS Karagola (1887) 01.jpg|thumb|A steamer owned by [[British-India Steam Navigation Company]] in 1887|229x229px]]
The port was important not only for inland navigation but also for international shipping.

Nowadays, although much diminished from its past prominence, water-based transport still plays an important role in connecting between Mawlamyine and the immediate upstream towns.

==Culture==
Mawlamyine provides a [[multicultural]] dimension despite a Buddhist [[Mon people|Mon]] majority. [[Culture of Buddhism|Buddhist cultural]] dominance is as old as Mawlamyine, but the British [[annexation]] and American missionaries in the early 19th century introduced Christianity.
