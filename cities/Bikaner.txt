'''Bikaner''' ({{audio|Bikaner.ogg|pronunciation|help=no}}) is a city in the northwest of the [[States and territories of India|state]] of [[Rajasthan]], [[India]]. It is located {{convert|330|km|mi|0}} northwest of the state capital, [[Jaipur]]. It is the administrative headquarters of [[Bikaner District]] and [[Bikaner division]].

Formerly the capital of the princely [[Bikaner State]], the city was founded by [[Rao Bika]], a [[Rajput]] [[Tribal chief|chief]] of the [[Rathore dynasty]] in 1488 CE<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prachinamuseum.org/bikaner.htm |title=PRACHINA - Bikaner Cultural Centre & Museum, Prachina - Cultural capital of Marwar, Bikaner Museum, Prachina Museum, Bikaner Royal family, Western influence in Bikaner, Contemporary Crafts, Bikaner Period Room, Ritual Crafts, Aristocratic Textile & Costumes, Royal Portraits, Glass and Cut Glass Objects, Decorative Wall Painting, Aristocratic Locomotive, Museum Galleries |publisher=Prachinamuseum.org |access-date=12 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121105101240/http://www.prachinamuseum.org/bikaner.htm |archive-date=5 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=kalaloda |url=http://www.travelgrove.com/travel-guides/India/Bikaner-History-c868406.html |title=Bikaner History, India |publisher=Travelgrove.com |access-date=12 September 2013}}</ref> and from its small origins it has developed into the fourth largest city in Rajasthan. The [[Ganga Canal (Rajasthan)|Ganga Canal]], completed in 1928, and the [[Indira Gandhi Canal]], completed in 1987, facilitated its development.

==Etymology==
The name "Bikaner" is a combination of two elements: "Bika", derived from the city's founder, [[Rao Bika]] and "Ner", which is believed to mean "place" or "city" in the local [[Rajasthani languages|Rajasthani language]]. Hence, "Bikaner" translates to "the city of Bika".{{citation needed|date=September 2023}}

{{Further|History of Bikaner}}

Prior to the mid 15th century, the region that is now Bikaner was a barren wilderness called [[Jangladesh]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=TL |first1=Prabhu |title=Majestic Monuments of India: Ancient Indian Mega Structures |date=4 August 2019 |publisher=Nestfame Creations Pvt.

Rao Bika established the city of Bikaner in 1488. He was the first son of [[Maharaja]] [[Rao Jodha]] of the [[Rathore (Rajput clan)|Rathore]] clan, the founder of [[Jodhpur]] and conquered the largely arid country in the north of Rajasthan. As the first son of Jodha he wanted to have his own kingdom, not inheriting Jodhpur from his father or the title of Maharaja. He therefore decided to build his own kingdom in what is now the state of Bikaner, in the area of Jangladesh. Though it was in the [[Thar Desert]], Bikaner was considered an [[oasis]] on the trade route between [[Central Asia]] and the [[Gujarat]] coast as it had adequate spring water. Bika's name was attached to the city he built and to the state of Bikaner ("the settlement of Bika") that he established. Bika built a fort in 1478, which is now in ruins, and a hundred years later a new fort was built about 1.5&nbsp;km from the city centre, known as the Junagarh Fort.<ref name=Ring>{{Cite book|last=Ring|first=Trudy|author2=Robert M.

Around a century after Rao Bika founded Bikaner, the state's fortunes flourished under the sixth Raja, Rai Singhji, who ruled from 1571 to 1611. During the [[Mughal Empire]]'s rule in the country, Raja Rai Singh accepted the [[suzerainty]] of the Mughals and held a high rank as an army general at the court of the Emperor [[Akbar]] and his son, the Emperor [[Jahangir]]. Rai Singh's successful military exploits, which involved winning half of [[Mewar|Mewar kingdom]] for the Empire, won him accolades and rewards from the Mughal emperors. He was given the [[jagir]]s (lands) of Gujarat and [[Burhanpur]]. With the large revenue earned from these jagirs, he built the [[Junagarh Fort|Chintamani Durg (Junagarh fort)]] on a plain that has an average elevation of {{convert|760|ft|m}}. He was an expert in arts and architecture, and the knowledge he acquired during his visits abroad is amply reflected in the numerous monuments he built at the Junagarh fort.<ref name=Ring/><ref name=history/><ref name=Juna>{{cite web|url=http://www.realbikaner.com/palace/junagarh/index.html|title=Junagarh Fort, Bikaner|access-date=7 December 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090416053153/http://www.realbikaner.com/palace/junagarh/index.html|archive-date=16 April 2009}}</ref>

Maharaja Karan Singh, who ruled from 1631 to 1639, under the suzerainty of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]], built the Karan Mahal palace. Later rulers added more floors and decorations to this Mahal. [[Anup Singh of Bikaner|Anup Singh]], who ruled from 1669 to 1698, made substantial additions to the fort complex, including new palaces and the [[Zenana]] quarter, a royal dwelling for women and children. He refurbished the Karan Mahal with a Diwan-i-Am (public audience hall) and called it the Anup Mahal. Maharaja Gaj Singh, who ruled from 1746 to 1787 refurbished the Chandra Mahal (the Moon Palace).

During the 18th century, there was an internecine war between the rulers of Bikaner and Jodhpur and also among other [[Thakur (Indian title)|thakurs]], which was put down by British troops.<ref name=history/>

Following Maharaja Gaj Singh, Maharaja Surat Singh ruled from 1787 to 1828 and lavishly decorated the audience hall (see illustration) with glass and lively paintwork. Under a [[subsidiary alliance|treaty of paramountcy]] signed in 1818, during Maharaja Surat Singh's reign, Bikaner came under the [[suzerainty]] of the British, after which the Maharajas of Bikaner invested heavily in refurbishing Junagarh fort.<ref name="Ring p.133">Ring p.133</ref>

[[Dungar Singh]], who reigned from 1872 to 1887, built the Badal Mahal, the 'weather palace', so named in view of a painting of clouds and falling rain, a rare event in arid Bikaner.

[[General (United Kingdom)|General]] [[Maharaja]] [[Ganga Singh]], who ruled from 1887 to 1943, was the best-known of the Rajasthan princes and was a favourite of the British [[Viceroy of India|Viceroys of India]]. He was appointed a [[Knight Commander]] of the [[Order of the Star of India]], served as a member of the [[Imperial War Cabinet]], represented India at the Imperial Conferences during the [[World War I|First World War]] and the [[British Empire]] at the [[Versailles Peace Conference]]. His contribution to the building activity in Junagarh involved separate halls for public and private audiences in the Ganga Mahal and a [[durbar (court)|durbar]] hall for formal functions. He also built the Ganga Niwas Palace, which has towers at the entrance patio. This palace was designed by [[Sir Samuel Swinton Jacob]], the third of the new palaces built in Bikaner. He named the building [[Lalgarh Palace]] in honour of his father, and moved his main residence there from [[Junagarh Fort]] in 1902. The hall where he held his Golden Jubilee (in 1938) as Bikaner's ruler is now a museum.<ref name=history/><ref name="Ring p.133"/><ref name="Ring p.132">Ring p.132</ref>

[[Ganga Singh]]'s son, [[Lieutenant-General (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Sadul Singh of Bikaner|Sir Sadul Singh]], the [[Yuvaraja]] of [[Bikaner (princely state)|Bikaner]], succeeded his father as [[Maharaja]] in 1943, but [[Instrument of Accession|acceded]] his state to the [[Dominion of India|Union of India]] in 1949. Maharaja Sadul Singh died in 1950, being succeeded in the [[title]] by his son, [[Karni Singh]] (1924–1988).<ref name=Ward/> The Royal Family still lives in a suite in Lalgarh Palace, which they have converted into a heritage hotel.<ref name=history/><ref name="Ring p.133"/>
