'''Koblenz''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|k|oʊ|ˈ|b|l|ɛ|n|t|s}} {{respell|koh|BLENTS}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|k|oʊ|b|l|ɛ|n|t|s}} {{respell|KOH|blents}}, {{IPA|de|ˈkoːblɛnts|lang|De-Koblenz.ogg}}) is a German city on the banks of the [[Rhine]] ([[Middle Rhine]]) and the [[Moselle]], a multinational tributary.

Koblenz was established as a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] military post by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]] {{Circa|8 BC}}. Its name originates from the [[Latin]] ''{{lang|la|(ad) cōnfluentēs}}'', meaning "(at the) [[confluence]]".<ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Coblenz|volume=6|page=612}}</ref> The actual confluence is today known as the "[[Deutsches Eck|German Corner]]", a symbol of the [[unification of Germany]] that features an [[Emperor William monuments|equestrian statue of Emperor William I]]. The city celebrated its 2,000th anniversary in 1992.

It ranks in population behind [[Mainz]] and [[Ludwigshafen am Rhein]] to be the third-largest city in [[Rhineland-Palatinate]]. Its usual-residents' population is 112,000 ({{As of|2015|lc=y}}). Koblenz lies in a narrow flood plain between high hill ranges, some reaching mountainous height, and is served by an express rail and autobahn network.  It is part of the populous [[Rhineland]].

==Name==
Historic spellings include ''Covelenz'', ''Coblenz'', and ''Cobelenz''. In [[Moselle Franconian language|local dialect]] the name is as the first historic spelling indicates, in German orthography, Kowelenz.

===Ancient era===
Around 1000 BC, early fortifications were erected on the [[Festung Ehrenbreitstein]] hill on the opposite side of the Rhine. In 55 BC, Roman troops commanded by [[Julius Caesar]] reached the Rhine and built a [[Caesar's Rhine bridges|bridge]] between Koblenz and [[Andernach]]. About 9 BC, the ''Castellum apud Confluentes'', was one of the military posts established by [[Nero Claudius Drusus|Drusus]].

Remains of a large bridge built in 49 AD by the Romans are still visible. The Romans built two forts as protection for the bridge, one in 9 AD and another in the 2nd century, the latter being destroyed by the [[Franks]] in 259. North of Koblenz was a temple of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] and [[Rosmerta]] (a Gallo-Roman deity), which remained in use up to the 5th century.

===Middle Ages===
With the fall of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the city was conquered by the Franks and became a royal seat.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} After the division of [[Charlemagne]]'s empire, it was included in the lands of his son [[Louis the Pious]] (814). In 837, it was assigned to [[Charles the Bald]], and a few years later it was here that Carolingian heirs discussed what was to become the [[Treaty of Verdun]] (843), by which the city became part of [[Lotharingia]] under [[Lothair I]].{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} In 860 and 922, Koblenz was the scene of ecclesiastical synods. At the first synod, held in the Liebfrauenkirche, the reconciliation of [[Louis the German]] with his half-brother Charles the Bald took place. In the second, slavery was condemned, specifically it was decreed that any man that 'led away a Christian man and then sold him' should be considered guilty of homicide.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} The city was sacked and destroyed by the [[Norsemen]] in 882. In 925, it became part of the eastern German Kingdom, later the [[Holy Roman Empire]].{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

In 1018, the city was given by the emperor [[Henry II, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry II]] to the [[archbishop-elector of Trier]] after receiving a charter. It remained in the possession of his successors until the end of the 18th century, having been their main residence since the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}} Emperor [[Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor|Conrad II]] was elected here in 1138. In 1198, the battle between [[Philip of Swabia]] and [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Otto IV]] took place nearby. In 1216, prince-bishop [[Theoderich von Wied]] donated part of the lands of the basilica and the hospital to the [[Teutonic Knights]], which later became the ''Deutsches Eck''.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

In 1249–1254, Koblenz was given new walls by Archbishop [[Arnold II of Isenburg]]; and it was partly to overawe the turbulent citizens that successive archbishops built and strengthened the fortress of Ehrenbreitstein that still dominates the city.{{citation needed|date=August 2023}}

===French Revolution===

====Home of Royalist émigrés====

When the [[French Revolution]] broke out, Koblenz became a popular hub of royalist émigrés and escaping feudal lords who had fled France.<ref>{{cite book

Officers and men were recruited through the Gazette de Paris (sixty [[Livre tournois|livres]] for each recruit), and the enrolled men were then sent to [[Metz]] and afterwards to Koblenz, and in a visit by Claude Allier to Koblenz in January 1792, he stated that 60,000 men were armed and ready to take action.<ref>{{cite book

====Near destruction by Royalist forces====

On July 26, 1792, the [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Duke of Brunswick]], who commanded one of the invading armies, composed of 70,000 Prussians and 68,000 Austrians, Hessians and émigrés, began to march upon Koblenz.  He published a manifesto in which he threatened to set fire to the towns that dared to defend themselves, and to exterminate their inhabitants as rebels, including Koblenz.  The city's fate was at hand.  But, just as in World War 1, the torrential rains and difficult conditions of the [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne]] forest halted the invaders, the roads "were liquid mud," and supplies began to run out due to weather impacting supply lines.  The radical revolutionary [[Georges Danton]] negotiated with the Duke of Brunswick, under unknown conditions, for his retreat, which was carried out through [[Grandpré, Ardennes|Grand-Pré]] and [[Verdun]], then across the [[Rhine]], and the city of Koblenz was saved.<ref>{{cite book

====Participation in the Vendee uprising====

In 1793, the uprising of [[War in the Vendée|Catholic peasants at the Vendée]] aimed at the overthrow of the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]], which began only after emissaries from Koblenz traveled there, bringing [[papal bull]]s, royal decrees and gold.  In escaping the watchful eye of French revolutionary forces, these emissaries were aided and protected by the middle classes, the ex-slave-traders of [[Nantes]], and the anti-[[sans-culottes]], pro-England merchants.<ref>{{cite book

====Overall influence====

Due to their experience in the French Revolution, [[Peter Kropotkin]] had termed the phrase ''Koblenzian'' to describe the type of royalist émigrés that lived in Koblenz.<ref>{{cite book

===Modern era===
The city was a member of the league of the Rhenish cities which rose in the 13th century. The [[Teutonic Knights]] founded the [[Bailiwick of Koblenz]] in or around 1231. Koblenz attained great prosperity and it continued to advance until the disaster of the [[Thirty Years' War]] brought about a rapid decline. After [[Philipp Christoph von Sötern|Philip Christopher, elector of Trier]], surrendered Ehrenbreitstein to the French, the city received an imperial garrison in 1632. However, this force was soon expelled by the Swedes, who in their turn handed the city over again to the French. Imperial forces finally succeeded in retaking it by storm in 1636.

In 1688, Koblenz was besieged by the French under [[Louis François Boufflers|Marshal de Boufflers]], but they only succeeded in bombing the Old City (''Altstadt'') into ruins, destroying among other buildings the Old Merchants' Hall (''Kaufhaus''), which was restored in its present form in 1725. The city was the residence of the [[Archbishopric of Trier|archbishop-electors of Trier]] from 1690 to 1801.

In 1786, the last archbishop-elector of Trier, [[Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony]], greatly assisted the extension and improvement of the city, turning the [[Ehrenbreitstein]] into a magnificent baroque palace. After the fall of the [[Storming of the Bastille|Bastille]] in 1789, the city became, through the invitation of the archbishop-elector's chief minister, Ferdinand Freiherr von Duminique, one of the principal rendezvous points for French [[émigrés]]. The archbishop-elector approved of this because he was the uncle of the persecuted king of France, [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. Among the many royalist French refugees who flooded into the city were [[Louis XVI]]'s two younger brothers, the [[Louis XVIII|Comte de Provence]] and the [[Charles X of France|Comte d'Artois]]. In addition, [[Louis XVI]]'s cousin, Prince [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé]], arrived and formed an army of young aristocrats willing to fight the [[French Revolution]] and restore the [[Ancien Régime]]. The ''[[Army of Condé]]'' joined with an allied army of Prussian and Austrian soldiers led by Duke [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Karl Wilhelm Ferdinand]] of [[Duchy of Brunswick|Brunswick]] in an unsuccessful invasion of France in 1792. This drew down the wrath of the [[First French Republic]] on the archbishop-elector; in 1794, Koblenz was taken by the French Revolutionary army under [[François Séverin Marceau-Desgraviers|Marceau]] (who was killed during the siege), and, after the signing of the [[Treaty of Lunéville]] (1801) it was made the capital of the new French [[Departments of France|department]] of [[Rhin-et-Moselle]]. In 1814, it was occupied by the [[Russia]]ns. The [[Congress of Vienna]] assigned the city to [[Prussia]], and in 1822, it was made the seat of government for the Prussian [[Rhine Province]].

After [[World War I]], France [[Occupation of the Rhineland|occupied]] the area once again. The city was the center of the American occupation force from 1919 - 1923. In defiance of the French, the German populace of the city insisted on using the more German spelling of '''Koblenz''' after 1926. During [[World War II]] it hosted the command of German [[Army Group B]] and, like many counterparts, was heavily bombed and rebuilt afterwards. From 16 &ndash; 19 March 1945, it was the scene of heavy fighting by the [[U.S. 87th Infantry Division]] in support of [[Operation Lumberjack]]. Between 1947 and 1950, it served as the [[Seat of government#Seat of government|seat of government]] of [[Rhineland-Palatinate]].

The [[Rhine Gorge]] was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] in 2002, with Koblenz marking the northern end.

{{main|Koblenz Fortress}}
Its defensive works are extensive, and consist of strong forts crowning the hills encircling the city to the west, and the citadel of [[Ehrenbreitstein]] on the opposite bank of the Rhine. The old city was triangular in shape, two sides being bounded by the Rhine and Mosel and the third by a line of fortifications. The latter were razed in 1890, and the city was permitted to expand in this direction. The [[Koblenz Hauptbahnhof]] (central station) was built on a spacious site outside the former walls at the junction of the [[Linke Rheinstrecke|Cologne-Mainz railway]] and the strategic [[Cannons Railway|Metz-Berlin line]]. In April 2011 [[Koblenz-Stadtmitte station]] was opened in the inner city to coincide with the opening of the [[Federal Garden Show 2011]]. The Rhine is crossed by the [[Pfaffendorf Bridge]], originally the location of a rail bridge, but now a road bridge and, a mile south of city, by the [[Horchheim Railway Bridge]], consisting of two wide and lofty spans carrying the [[Lahntal railway]], part of the Berlin railway referred to above. The Moselle is spanned by a Gothic freestone bridge of 14 arches, erected in 1344, two modern road bridges and also by two railway bridges.

Since 1890, the city has consisted of the Altstadt (old city) and the Neustadt (new city) or Klemenstadt. Of these, the Altstadt is closely built and has only a few fine streets and squares, while the Neustadt possesses numerous broad streets and a handsome frontage along the Rhine.

===Other sights===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}
In the more ancient part of Koblenz stand several buildings which have a historical interest. Prominent among these, near the point of confluence of the rivers, is the [[Basilica of St. Castor]] or ''Kastorkirche'', dedicated to [[Castor of Karden]], with four towers. The church was founded in 836 by [[Louis the Pious]], but the present [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] building was completed in 1208, the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] vaulted roof dating from 1498. In front of the church of Saint Castor stands a fountain, erected by the French in 1812, with an inscription to commemorate Napoleon's invasion of Russia. Not long after, Russian troops occupied Koblenz; and St. Priest, their commander, added in irony these words: "Vu et approuvé par nous, Commandant russe de la Ville de Coblence: Janvier 1er, 1814."

In this quarter of the city, too, is the ''Liebfrauenkirche'', a fine church (nave 1250, choir 1404–1431) with lofty late Romanesque towers; the castle of the electors of [[Trier]], erected in 1280, which now contains the municipal picture gallery; and the family house of the Metternichs, where [[Klemens Wenzel von Metternich|Prince Metternich]], the Austrian statesman, was born in 1773. Also notable is the church of St. Florian, with a two towers façade from {{circa|1110|lk=no}}.

The former Jesuit College is a Baroque edifice by J.C. Sebastiani (1694–1698) serves as the current City Hall.

Near Koblenz is the [[Lahneck Castle]] near Lahnstein, open to visitors from 1 April to 31 October.

The city is close to the [[Bronze Age]] [[earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]] at [[Goloring]], a possible [[Urnfield]] calendar constructed some 3,000 years ago.

The mild climate allows [[fig trees]], [[olive trees]], [[palm trees]] and other Mediterranean plants to grow in the area.

===Electoral palace===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2023}}

{{main|Electoral Palace (Koblenz)}}
In the modern part of the city lies the palace (''Residenzschloss''), with one front looking towards the Rhine, the other into the Neustadt. It was built in 1778–1786 by [[Clemens Wenceslaus of Saxony|Clemens Wenceslaus]], the last elector of Trier, following a design by the French architect P.M. d'Ixnard. In 1833, the palace was used as a barracks, and became a terminal post for the [[Prussian semaphore system|optical telecommunications system]] that originated in Potsdam. Today, the elector's former palace is a museum. Among other exhibits, it contains some [[Gobelin]] tapestries. From it some gardens and promenades (Kaiserin Augusta Anlagen) stretch along the bank of the Rhine, and in them is a memorial to the poet [[Max von Schenkendorf]]. A statue to the empress Augusta, whose favorite residence was Koblenz, stands in the Luisenplatz.

===William I monument===
The [[Teutonic Knights]] were given an area for their [[Deutschherrenhaus]] [[Bailiwick]] right at the confluence of the Rhine and Mosel, which became known as ''German Corner'' ([[Deutsches Eck]]).

In 1897, a monument to [[German Emperor]] [[William I of Germany]], mounted on a {{convert|14|m|4=-tall|adj=mid|sp=us}} horse, was inaugurated there by his grandson [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]]. The architect was [[Bruno Schmitz]], who was responsible for a number of nationalistic German monuments and memorials. The ''German Corner'' is since associated with this monument, the (re) foundation of the German Empire and the German refusal of any French claims to the area, as described in the song "[[Die Wacht am Rhein]]" together with the "Wacht am Rhein" called "[[Niederwalddenkmal]]" some {{convert|60|km|0|abbr=off|sp=us}} upstream.

During World War II, the statue was destroyed by US artillery. The French occupation administration intended the complete destruction of the monument and wanted to replace it with a new one.

In 1953, Bundespräsident [[Theodor Heuss]] rededicated the monument to [[German reunification|German unity]], adding the signs of the remaining western federal states as well as the ones of the lost areas in the East. A [[Flag of Germany]] has flown there since. The [[Saarland]] was added four years later after the population had voted to join Germany.

In the 1980s, a film clip of the monument was often shown on late night TV when the national anthem was played to mark the end of the day, a practice which was discontinued when nonstop broadcasting became common. On October 3, 1990, the very day the former GDR states joined, their signs were added to the monument.

As German unity was considered complete and the areas under Polish administration were ceded to Poland, the monument lost its official active purpose, now only reminding of history. In 1993, the flag was replaced by a copy of the statue, donated by a local couple. The day chosen for the reinstatement of the statue, however, caused controversy as it coincided with [[Sedantag]] (Sedan Day) (September 2, 1870) a day of celebration remembering Germany's victory over France in the Battle of Sedan.<ref>Jefferies, Matthew, ''Imperial Culture in Germany, 1871–1918'' (Basingstoke: Palgrave, 2003)</ref> The event was widely celebrated from the 1870s until the 1910s.

Koblenz is a principal seat of the Mosel and Rhenish wine trade, and also does a large business in the export of mineral waters. Its manufactures include automotive parts (braking systems – [[TRW Automotive]], gas springs and hydraulic vibration dampers – [[Stabilus]]), aluminum coils ([[Aleris International, Inc.]]), pianos, paper, cardboard, machinery, boats, and barges. Since the 17th century, it has been home to the [[Königsbacher]] (now Koblenzer) brewery (the Old Brewery in Koblenz's historic center, and now a plant in Koblenz-Stolzenfels). It is an important regional transit hub.

The headquarters of the [[German Army Forces Command]] was located in the city until 2012. Its successor, the [[German Army Command]] (German: Kommando Heer, Kdo H) is based at the von-Hardenberg-Kaserne in Strausberg, Brandenburg.

It is based at the Falckenstein-Barracks (Falckenstein-Kaserne) and the Rhine-Barracks (Rhein-Kaserne) in Koblenz. It is the high command of the German Army Joint Medical Service.

The children's toy [[yo-yo]] was nicknamed ''de Coblenz (Koblenz)'' in 18th-century France, referring to the large number of noble French émigrées then living in the city.<ref name="yo yo ">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalyoyo.org/museum/generalhistory.htm |title=Untitled Document |access-date=2010-01-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513174344/http://www.nationalyoyo.org/museum/generalhistory.htm |archive-date=2008-05-13 }} National Yo-Yo Museum, California</ref>
