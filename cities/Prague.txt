==Etymology and names==
{{see also|Names of European cities in different languages (M–P)#P}}

The Czech name Praha is derived from an old [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word, {{lang|sla|práh}}, which means "[[ford (crossing)|ford]]" or "[[Rapids|rapid]]", referring to the city's origin at a crossing point of the Vltava river.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://praguesummer.com/whats-in-a-name-prague-history-lesson/ |title=What's in a Name? (Prague History Lesson) |website=Prague Summer Program for Writers |date=22 February 2016 |access-date=14 March 2016 |archive-date=14 March 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314063453/http://praguesummer.com/whats-in-a-name-prague-history-lesson/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Another view to the origin of the name is also related to the Czech word {{lang|cs|práh}} (with the meaning of a [[Threshold (door)|threshold]]) and a legendary etymology connects the name of the city with princess [[Libuše]], prophetess and a wife of the mythical founder of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]]. She is said to have ordered the city "to be built where a man hews a threshold of his house". The Czech {{lang|cs|práh}} might thus be understood to refer to rapids or fords in the river, the edge of which could have acted as a means of fording the river&nbsp;– thus providing a "threshold" to the castle.

Another derivation of the name ''Praha'' is suggested from ''na prazě'', the original term for the [[shale]] hillside rock upon which the original castle was built. At that time, the castle was surrounded by forests, covering the nine hills of the future city&nbsp;– the [[Old Town, Prague|Old Town]] on the opposite side of the river, as well as the [[Lesser Town]] beneath the existing castle, appeared only later.<ref name=praha>{{cite book |last=Dudák|first=Vladislav|title=Praha: Průvodce magickým centrem Evropy |trans-title=Prague: A Guide to the Magical Center of Europe |year=2010 |publisher=Práh |location=Praha|isbn=978-80-7252-302-3|page=184}}</ref>

The English spelling of the city's name is borrowed from [[French language|French]]. In the 19th and early 20th centuries it was pronounced in English to rhyme with "vague": it was so pronounced by [[Lady Diana Cooper]] (born 1892) on [[Desert Island Discs]] in 1969,<ref>{{cite web |title=Interview with Lady Diana Cooper |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p009y17t |website=Desert Island Discs |access-date=2 February 2019 |ref=at 11 minutes 4 seconds |date=24 March 1969 |archive-date=3 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190203031337/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p009y17t |url-status=live}}</ref> and it is written to rhyme with "vague" in a verse of [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Beleaguered_City The Beleaguered City] by [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]] (1839) and also in the limerick [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/There_was_an_Old_Lady_of_Prague There was an Old Lady of Prague] by [[Edward Lear]] (1846).

Prague is also called the ''"City of a Hundred [[Spire]]s"'', based on a count by 19th century mathematician [[Bernard Bolzano]]; today's count is estimated by the Prague Information Service at 500.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/kolik-vezi-ma-stovezata-praha-nadsenci-jich-napocitali-pres-pet-set-1fv-/domaci.aspx?c=A100805_115917_praha-zpravy_sfo |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514204127/http://zpravy.idnes.cz/kolik-vezi-ma-stovezata-praha-nadsenci-jich-napocitali-pres-pet-set-1fv-/domaci.aspx?c=A100805_115917_praha-zpravy_sfo |archive-date=14 May 2013 |title=Kolik věží má "stověžatá" Praha?

==History==
{{Main|History of Prague}}
{{For timeline}}
Prague has grown from a settlement stretching from [[Prague Castle]] in the north to the fort of [[Vyšehrad]] in the south, to become the capital of a modern European country.

===Early history===
[[File:Josef Mathauser - Kněžna Libuše věští slávu Prahy.jpg|thumb|The mythological princess Libuše prophesies the glory of Prague.]]
The region was settled as early as the [[Paleolithic]] age.<ref name="Demetz1997" /> Jewish chronicler [[David Gans|David Solomon Ganz]], citing [[Cyriacus Spangenberg]], claimed that the city was founded as Boihaem in {{Circa|1306}} [[Anno Domini|BC]] by an ancient king, Boyya.<ref name=ganz />

Around the fifth and fourth century BC, a [[Celts|Celtic]] tribe appeared in the area, later establishing settlements, including the largest Celtic [[oppidum]] in [[Bohemia]], Závist, in a present-day south suburb [[Zbraslav]] in Prague, and naming the region of Bohemia, which means "home of the Boii people".<ref name="Demetz1997">{{cite book |last=Demetz |first=Peter|chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/pragueinblackgol00deme |title=Prague in Black and Gold: Scenes from the Life of a European City |publisher=Hill and Wang |location=New York |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-8090-7843-1 |chapter=Chapter One: Libussa, or Versions of Origin |access-date=7 April 2016|chapter-url-access=registration}}</ref><ref name="bohemiaradio">{{cite web |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/unearthing-bohemias-celtic-heritage-ahead-of-samhain-the-new-year |title=Unearthing Bohemia's Celtic heritage ahead of Samhain, the 'New Year' |last=Kenety |first=Brian |date=29 October 2004 |publisher=Czech Radio |access-date=9 August 2016 |archive-date=10 August 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160810140803/http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/unearthing-bohemias-celtic-heritage-ahead-of-samhain-the-new-year |url-status=live}}</ref> In the last century BC, the Celts were slowly driven away by [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]] ([[Marcomanni]], [[Quadi]], [[Lombards]] and possibly the [[Suebi]]), leading some to place the seat of the [[Marcomanni]] king, [[Maroboduus]], in Závist.<ref name="marobudradio">{{cite web |url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/leonardo/historie/_zprava/202797 |title=Atlantis české archeologie |last=Kenety |first=Brian |date=19 November 2005 |publisher=Czech Radio |language=cs |access-date=9 August 2016 |archive-date=13 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913181056/http://www.rozhlas.cz/leonardo/historie/_zprava/202797 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="ganz">Dovid Solomon Ganz, Tzemach Dovid (3rd edition), part 2, Warsaw 1878, pp. 71, 85 ([https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21930&st=&pgnum=72&hilite=available online] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220421152851/https://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=21930&st=&pgnum=72&hilite=available |date=21 April 2022}})</ref> Around the area where present-day Prague stands, the 2nd century map drawn by Roman geographer [[Ptolemy|Ptolemaios]] mentioned a Germanic city called ''Casurgis''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cs-magazin.com/index.php?a=a2011021048 |title=Praha byla Casurgis |trans-title=Prague was Casurgis |language=cs |publisher=cs-magazin.com |date=February 2011 |access-date=7 April 2016 |archive-date=13 April 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413175204/http://www.cs-magazin.com/index.php?a=a2011021048 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In the late 5th century AD, during the great [[Migration Period]] following the collapse of the [[Western Roman Empire]], the Germanic tribes living in Bohemia moved westwards and, probably in the 6th century, the [[West Slavs|Slavic tribes]] settled the Central Bohemian Region.

The legendary origins of Prague attribute its foundation to the 8th-century Czech duchess and prophetess [[Libuše]] and her husband, [[Přemysl, the Ploughman|Přemysl]], founder of the [[Přemyslid dynasty]].

Prague flourished during the 14th-century reign (1346–1378) of [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]] and the king of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] of the new [[House of Luxembourg|Luxembourg dynasty]]. As King of Bohemia and Holy Roman Emperor, he transformed Prague into an imperial capital. In the 1470s, Prague had around 70,000 inhabitants and with an area of 360 ha (~1.4 square miles) it was the third-largest city in the Holy Roman Empire.<ref>{{cite news |title=Deset století architektury (1997) [TV cyklus] - Nové Město pražské (1998), 2. série - 21. díl |url=https://www.fdb.cz/film/deset-stoleti-architektury-2-serie-21-dil-nove-mesto-prazske/52565 |work=FDb.cz |language=cs |access-date=4 March 2023 |archive-date=5 March 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230305221610/https://www.fdb.cz/film/deset-stoleti-architektury-2-serie-21-dil-nove-mesto-prazske/52565 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Charles IV ordered the building of the [[New Town, Prague|New Town]] (Nové Město) adjacent to the [[Old Town (Prague)|Old Town]] and laid out the design himself. The Charles Bridge, replacing the Judith Bridge destroyed in the flood just prior to his reign, was erected to connect the east bank districts to the Malá Strana and castle area. In 1347, he founded [[Charles University]], the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest university]] in Central Europe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cuni.cz |title=Charles University Official Website |access-date=21 April 2022 |archive-date=29 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071029011251/http://www.cuni.cz/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

His father [[John of Bohemia]] began construction of the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[St. Vitus Cathedral|Saint Vitus Cathedral]], within the largest of the Prague Castle courtyards, on the site of the Romanesque rotunda there.

The city had a [[mint (coin)|mint]] and was a center of trade for German and Italian bankers and merchants.

The Hunger Wall, a substantial fortification wall south of Malá Strana and the castle area was built during a famine in the 1360s.

Charles IV died in 1378. During the reign of his son, King [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus IV]] (1378–1419), a period of intense turmoil ensued. During Easter 1389, members of the Prague clergy announced that Jews had desecrated the host (Eucharistic wafer) and the clergy encouraged mobs to pillage, ransack and burn the Jewish quarter. Nearly the entire Jewish population of Prague (ca 750 people) was murdered.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.everything2.org/title/The%2520Prague%2520Pogrom%2520of%25201389 |publisher=Everything2 |title=The Prague Pogrom of 1389 |date=April 1389 |access-date=16 June 2009 |archive-date=18 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618060237/http://www.everything2.org/title/The%2520Prague%2520Pogrom%2520of%25201389 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prague.cz/jewish-quarter/ |publisher=prague.cz |title=The former Jewish Quarter in Prague |date=April 1389 |access-date=16 June 2009 |archive-date=17 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417235108/http://www.prague.cz/jewish%2Dquarter/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Jan Hus]], a theologian and [[Rector (academia)|rector]] at Charles University, preached in Prague. In 1402, he began giving sermons in the [[Bethlehem Chapel]]. Inspired by [[John Wycliffe]], these sermons focused on what were seen as radical reforms of a corrupt Church. Having become too dangerous for the political and religious establishment, Hus was summoned to the [[Council of Constance]], put on trial for [[heresy]], and burned at the stake in [[Konstanz]] in 1415.

Four years later Prague experienced its [[Defenestrations of Prague|first defenestration]], when the people rebelled under the command of the Prague priest [[Jan Želivský]]. Hus' death, coupled with Czech proto-nationalism and [[proto-Protestantism]], had spurred the [[Hussite Wars]]. Peasant rebels, led by the general [[Jan Žižka]], along with Hussite troops from Prague, defeated Emperor [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund]], in the [[Battle of Vítkov Hill]] in 1420.

During the [[Hussite Wars]] when Prague was attacked by "Crusader" and mercenary forces, the city militia fought bravely under the Prague Banner. This swallow-tailed banner is approximately {{cvt|4|by|6|ft|m|abbr=off}}, with a red field sprinkled with small white fleurs-de-lis, and a silver old Town Coat-of-Arms in the center. The words "PÁN BŮH POMOC NAŠE" (The Lord is our Relief/Help) appeared above the coat-of-arms, with a Hussite chalice centered on the top. Near the swallow-tails is a crescent-shaped golden sun with rays protruding.

One of these banners was captured by Swedish troops during the [[Battle of Prague (1648)]] when they captured the western bank of the [[Vltava river]] and were repulsed from the eastern bank, they placed it in the [[Swedish Army Museum|Royal Military Museum]] in [[Stockholm]]; although this flag still exists, it is in very poor condition. They also took the [[Codex Gigas]] and the [[Codex Argenteus]]. The earliest evidence indicates that a [[gonfalon]] with a municipal charge painted on it was used for the Old Town as early as 1419. Since this city militia flag was in use before 1477 and during the Hussite Wars, it is the oldest still preserved municipal flag of Bohemia.

In the following two centuries, Prague strengthened its role as a merchant city. Many noteworthy Gothic buildings<ref>{{cite web |url=http://old.hrad.cz/castle/architektura/gotika_uk.html |title=Architecture of the Gothic |publisher=Old.hrad.cz |date=13 October 2005 |access-date=18 November 2013 |archive-date=8 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808144404/http://old.hrad.cz/castle/architektura/gotika_uk.html |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle/photogallery/prague-castle/9.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090401061009/http://www.hrad.cz/en/prague-castle/photogallery/prague-castle/9.shtml |archive-date=1 April 2009 |title=Old Royal Palace with Vladislav Hall – Prague Castle |publisher=Hrad.cz |date=16 December 2011 |access-date=18 November 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> were erected and [[Vladislav Hall]] of the Prague Castle was added.

In 1526, the Bohemian estates elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] of the [[House of Habsburg]]. The fervent Catholicism of its members brought them into conflict in Bohemia, and then in Prague, where Protestant ideas were gaining popularity.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prague.st/city-info/static/eng/czech-history/religious-conflicts.php |title=Religious conflicts |publisher=Prague.st |access-date=18 November 2013 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304235726/http://www.prague.st/city-info/static/eng/czech-history/religious-conflicts.php |url-status=live}}</ref> These problems were not preeminent under Holy Roman Emperor [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolf II]], elected King of Bohemia in 1576, who chose Prague as his home. He lived in Prague Castle, where his court welcomed not only astrologers and magicians but also scientists, musicians, and artists. Rudolf was an art lover as well, and Prague became the capital of European culture. This was a prosperous period for the city: famous people living there in that age include the astronomers [[Tycho Brahe]] and [[Johannes Kepler]], the painter [[Giuseppe Arcimboldo|Arcimboldo]], the alchemists [[Edward Kelley]] and [[John Dee]], the poet [[Elizabeth Jane Weston]], and others.

In 1618, the famous [[Defenestrations of Prague|second defenestration of Prague]] provoked the [[Thirty Years' War]], a particularly harsh period for Prague and Bohemia. [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]] of Habsburg was deposed, and his place as King of Bohemia taken by [[Frederick V, Elector Palatine]]; however his army was crushed in the [[Battle of White Mountain]] (1620) not far from the city. Following this in 1621 was an execution of 27 Czech Protestant leaders (involved in the uprising) in Old Town Square and the exiling of many others. Prague was forcibly converted back to [[Roman Catholicism]] followed by the rest of Czech lands. The city suffered subsequently during the war under an attack by [[Electorate of Saxony]] (1631) and during the [[Battle of Prague (1648)]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.family-lines.cz/html/Articles/30-war.htm |title=The Kingdom of Bohemia during the Thirty Years' War |publisher=Family-lines.cz |access-date=14 April 2011 |archive-date=18 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718172046/http://www.family-lines.cz/html/Articles/30-war.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> Prague began a steady decline which reduced the population from the 60,000 it had had in the years before the war to 20,000.

The economy of Prague continued to improve during the 18th century. The population increased to 80,000 inhabitants by 1771. Many rich merchants and nobles enhanced the city with a host of palaces, churches and gardens full of art and music, creating a [[Baroque]] city renowned throughout the world to this day.

In 1784, under [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]], the four municipalities of Malá Strana, Nové Město, Staré Město, and Hradčany were merged into a single entity. The Jewish district, called [[Josefov]], was included only in 1850. The [[Industrial Revolution]] produced great changes and developments in Prague, as new factories could take advantage of the coal mines and ironworks of the nearby regions. The first suburb, [[Karlín]], was created in 1817, and twenty years later the population exceeded 100,000.

[[Revolutions of 1848|The revolutions in Europe in 1848]] also touched Prague, but they were fiercely suppressed. In the following years, the [[Czech National Revival]] began its rise, until it gained the majority in the town council in 1861. Prague had a large number of German speakers in 1848, but by 1880 the number of German speakers had decreased to 14% (42,000), and by 1910 to 6.7% (37,000), due to a massive increase in the city's overall population caused by the influx of [[Czechs]] from the rest of Bohemia and [[Moravia]] and the increasing prestige and importance of the Czech language as part of the Czech National Revival.

On 5 May 1945, two days before Germany capitulated, an [[Prague uprising|uprising]] against Germany occurred. Several thousand Czechs were killed in four days of bloody street fighting, with many atrocities committed by both sides. At daybreak on 9 May, the {{nowrap|[[3rd Shock Army]]}} of the [[Red Army]] took the city almost unopposed. The majority (about 50,000 people) of the German population of Prague either fled or were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] by the [[Beneš decrees]] in the aftermath of the war.

[[File:Havla 1989.jpg|thumb|Velvet Revolution in November 1989]]

Prague was a city in a country under the military, economic, and political control of the [[Soviet Union]] (see [[Iron Curtain]] and [[COMECON]]). The world's largest [[Stalin Monument (Prague)|Stalin Monument]] was unveiled on [[Letná]] hill in 1955 and destroyed in 1962.
The 4th Czechoslovak Writers' Congress, held in the city in June 1967, took a strong position against the regime.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pehe |first1=Jiří |author-link=Jiří Pehe |title=Post-Communist Reflections of the Prague Spring |url=http://www.pehe.cz/Members/redaktor/post-communist-refections-of-the-prague-spring |website=Jiří Pehe |date=6 November 2008 |access-date=7 September 2017 |archive-date=17 September 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917092115/http://www.pehe.cz/Members/redaktor/post-communist-refections-of-the-prague-spring |url-status=live}}</ref> On 31 October 1967 students demonstrated at [[Strahov (district of Prague)|Strahov]]. This spurred the new secretary of the [[Czechoslovak Communist Party]], [[Alexander Dubček]], to proclaim a new deal in his city's and country's life, starting the short-lived season of the "[[socialism with a human face]]". It was the [[Prague Spring]], which aimed at the renovation of political institutions in a democratic way. The other [[Warsaw Pact]] member countries, except [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romania]] and [[People's Republic of Albania|Albania]], were led by the [[Soviet Union]] to repress these reforms through the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|invasion of Czechoslovakia]] and the capital, Prague, on 21 August 1968. The invasion, chiefly by infantry and tanks, effectively suppressed any further attempts at reform. The military occupation of Czechoslovakia by the [[Red Army]] would end only in 1991. [[Jan Palach]] and [[Jan Zajíc]] committed suicide by [[self-immolation]] in January and February 1969 to protest against the "[[Normalization (Czechoslovakia)|normalization]]" of the country.

===After the Velvet Revolution===
[[File:Mrakodrapy v Praze 2018.jpg|thumb|Prague high-rise buildings at [[Pankrác]]]]
In 1989, after riot police beat back a peaceful student demonstration, the [[Velvet Revolution]] crowded the streets of Prague, and the capital of [[Czech and Slovak Federative Republic|Czechoslovakia]] benefited greatly from the new mood. In 1992, the [[Historic Centre of Prague]] and its monuments were inscribed as a cultural [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]. In 1993, after the [[Velvet Divorce]], Prague became the capital city of the new Czech Republic. From 1995, high-rise buildings began to be built in Prague in large quantities. In the late 1990s, Prague again became an important cultural center of Europe and was notably influenced by [[globalisation]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=McAdams |first1=Michael |title=Global Cities as Centers of Cultural Influence: A Focus on Istanbul, Turkey |url=https://journals.openedition.org/transtexts/149 |work=Transtext(e)s Transcultures |date=1 September 2007 |issue=3 |pages=151–165 |doi=10.4000/transtexts.149 |access-date=15 July 2018 |archive-date=15 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180715123335/https://journals.openedition.org/transtexts/149 |url-status=live |issn=1771-2084}}</ref> In 2000, the [[IMF]] and [[World Bank]] summits took place in Prague and [[Anti-globalization protests in Prague|anti-globalization riots]] took place here.

==Administration==
===Administrative division===
[[File:Prague districts en.svg|thumb|Map of Prague cadastral areas and administrative districts]]
{{main|Districts of Prague}}
Prague is the capital of the Czech Republic and as such is the regular seat of its central authorities. Since 24 November 1990, it is de facto again a statutory city, but has a specific status of the municipality and the region at the same time. Prague also houses the administrative institutions of the [[Central Bohemian Region]].
[[File:Bohuslav_Svoboda_(2022).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda]]
Until 1949, all administrative districts of Prague were formed by the whole one or more cadastral unit, municipality or town. Since 1949, there has been a fundamental change in the administrative division. Since then, the boundaries of many urban districts, administrative districts and city districts are independent of the boundaries of cadastral territories and some cadastral territories are thus divided into administrative and self-governing parts of the city. [[Cadastre|Cadastral area]] (for example, [[Vinohrady]] and [[Smíchov]]) are still relevant especially for the registration of land and real estate and house numbering.

Prague is divided into 10 municipal districts (1–10), 22 administrative districts (1–22), 57 municipal parts, and 112 cadastral areas.
[[File:Mariánské náměstí 2-2 Praha, Staré Město 20170906 001.jpg|thumb|Prague New City Hall]]

===City government===
Prague is administered by the autonomous [[Prague City Assembly]], which consists of 65 members and is elected through municipal elections. The executive body of Prague, elected by the Assembly, is [[Prague City Council]]. The municipal office of Prague is at [[Prague City Hall]] and has 11 members, including the [[List of mayors of Prague|mayor]]. It prepares proposals for the Assembly meetings and ensures that adopted resolutions are fulfilled. The [[List of mayors of Prague|Mayor of Prague]] is [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] member [[Bohuslav Svoboda]].

==Demographics==
[[File:Prague population pyramid in 2021.svg|thumb|Prague population pyramid in 2021]]

===2011 census===
Even though the official population of Prague hovers around 1.3 million as of the [[2011 Czech census|2011 census]], the city's real population is much higher due to only 65% of its residents being marked as permanently living in the city.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/data-z-mobilu-praha-se-denne-nafoukne-o-polovinu-v-centru-jsou-navstevnici-v_1704211045_miz |title=Data z mobilů: Praha se denně nafoukne o polovinu, v centru jsou návštěvníci v převaze |work=iROZHLAS |access-date=26 September 2018 |language=cs |archive-date=26 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926131115/https://www.irozhlas.cz/zpravy-domov/data-z-mobilu-praha-se-denne-nafoukne-o-polovinu-v-centru-jsou-navstevnici-v_1704211045_miz |url-status=live}}</ref> Data taken from mobile phone movements around the city suggest that the real population of Prague is closer to 1.9 or 2.0 million, with an additional 300,000 to 400,000 commuters coming to the city on weekdays for work, education, or commerce.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.ekonomickymagazin.cz/2018/06/praha-by-mela-byt-planovana-jako-metropole-pro-dva-miliony-lidi/ |title=Praha by měla být metropole pro dva miliony lidí |work=Ekonomický Magazín |access-date=26 September 2018 |language=cs |archive-date=26 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180926130951/https://www.ekonomickymagazin.cz/2018/06/praha-by-mela-byt-planovana-jako-metropole-pro-dva-miliony-lidi/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

About 14% of the city's inhabitants were born outside the Czech Republic, the highest proportion in the country. However, 64.8% of the city's population self-identified as ethnically [[Czechs|Czech]], which is slightly higher than the national average of 63.7%. Almost 29% of respondents declined to answer the question on ethnicity at all, so it may be assumed that the real percentage of ethnic Czechs in Prague is considerably higher. The largest ethnic minority are [[Slovaks in the Czech Republic|Slovaks]], followed by Ukrainians and Russians.<ref name="auto">{{cite news |title=Census shows population rise in Prague |url=http://praguemonitor.com/2012/01/24/census-shows-population-rise-prague |publisher=Prague Daily Monitor |agency=Czech News Agency (ČTK) |date=24 January 2012 |access-date=16 April 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140416205818/http://praguemonitor.com/2012/01/24/census-shows-population-rise-prague |archive-date=16 April 2014}}</ref>

Prague's population is the oldest and best-educated in the country. It has the lowest proportion of children. Only 10.8% of census respondents claimed adherence to a religion; the majority of these were [[Roman Catholics]].<ref name="auto"/>

===Public transportation===
[[File:Prague 07-2016 tram at Florenc.jpg|thumb|Škoda 15 T, tram of the Prague tram system]]

The public transport infrastructure consists of the heavily used [[Prague Integrated Transport]] (PID, ''Pražská integrovaná doprava'') system, consisting of the [[Prague Metro]] (lines [[line A (Prague Metro)|A]], [[line B (Prague Metro)|B]], and [[line C (Prague Metro)|C]] – its length is {{cvt|65|km|0}} with 61 stations in total), [[Trams in Prague|Prague tram system]], [[Buses in Prague|Prague buses service]], [[Esko Prague|commuter trains]], [[funicular]]s, and seven [[Ferry|ferries]]. Prague has one of the highest rates of public transport usage in the world,<ref>{{cite web |title=Endurance |url=http://www.epomm.eu/endurance/index.php?id=2809&city=454 |publisher=Mgr.

Prague has about 300 bus lines (numbers 100–960) and 34 regular tram lines (numbers 1–26 and 91–99). As of 2022 the bus lines are being extended with [[trolley bus]] lines.

There are also three [[funicular]]s, the [[Petřín funicular]] on [[Petřín Hill]], one on Mrázovka Hill and a third at the [[Prague Zoo|Zoo in Troja]].
[[File:Prague - bus 112.jpg|left|thumb|[[SOR NB 18]] of the Prague buses service next to the Prague Zoo]]
[[Trams in Prague|The Prague tram system]] now operates various types of trams, including the [[Tatra T3]], newer [[Tatra KT8D5]], [[Škoda 14 T]] (designed by [[Porsche Design Group|Porsche]]), newer modern [[Škoda 15 T]] and nostalgic tram lines 23 and 41. Around 400 vehicles are the modernized [[Tatra T3|T3]] class, which are typically operated coupled together in pairs.

The Prague tram system is the [[Tram and light rail transit systems|twelfth longest]] in the world (144&nbsp;km) and its rolling stock consists of 786 individual cars,<ref>{{Urban Electric Transit |https://transphoto.org/show.php?cid=82&t=1}}</ref> which is the largest in the world. The system carries more than 360 million passengers annually, the highest tram patronage in the world after [[Budapest]], on a per capita basis, Prague has the second highest tram patronage after [[Zürich]].

All services (metro, tramways, city buses, funiculars and ferries) have a common ticketing system that operates on a [[proof-of-payment]] system. Basic transfer tickets can be bought for 30 and 90-minute rides, short-term tourist passes are available for periods of 24 hours or 3 days, and longer-term tickets can be bought on the smart ticketing system [[Lítačka]], for periods of one month, three months or one year.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dpp.cz/jizdne-na-uzemi-prahy/ |title=Jízdné na území Prahy |publisher=Dopravní podnik hlavnívo města Prahy |language=cs |access-date=24 October 2013 |archive-date=19 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100119031959/http://www.dpp.cz/jizdne-na-uzemi-prahy/ |url-status=live}}</ref> Since August 2021, people up to the age of 14 and over 65 can use Prague's public transport free of charge (proof of age is required). Persons between 15 and 18 years and between 60 and 64 years pay half price for single tickets and day tickets.

Services are run by the Prague Public Transport Company and several other companies. Since 2005 the ''Regional Organiser of Prague Integrated Transport (ROPID)'' has franchised operation of ferries on the [[Vltava]] river, which are also a part of the public transport system with common fares. [[Taxicab|Taxi]] services make pick-ups on the streets or operate from regulated taxi stands.

The first section of the Prague metro was put into operation in 1974. It was the stretch between stations [[Kačerov]] and [[Florenc (Prague Metro)|Florenc]] on the current [[line C (Prague Metro)|line C]]. The first part of [[line A (Prague Metro)|Line A]] was opened in 1978 ([[Dejvická]] – [[Náměstí Míru]]), the first part of [[line B (Prague Metro)|line B]] in 1985 ([[Anděl (Prague Metro)|Anděl]] – [[Florenc (Prague Metro)|Florenc]]).

In April 2015, construction finished to extend the green line A further into the northwest corner of Prague closer to the airport.<ref>{{cite web |last=Hold |first=Gabriella |title=Metro Extension on the Right Track |url=http://www.praguepost.com/news/4900-metro-extension-on-right-track.html |website=The Prague Post |location=Czech Republic |date=30 June 2010 |access-date=30 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114111627/http://www.praguepost.com/news/4900-metro-extension-on-right-track.html |archive-date=14 January 2012}}</ref> A new interchange station for the bus in the direction of the airport is the station [[Nádraží Veleslavín (Prague Metro)|Nádraží Veleslavín]]. The final station of the green line is [[Nemocnice Motol]] ([[Motol University Hospital|Motol Hospital]]), giving people direct public transportation access to the largest medical facility in the Czech Republic and one of the largest in Europe. A railway connection to the airport is planned.

In operation there are two kinds of units: "81-71M" which is modernized variant of the Soviet [[Metrovagonmash 81-717/81-714|Metrovagonmash 81-71]] (completely modernized between 1995 and 2003) and new "[[Metro M1 (Prague)|Metro M1]]" trains (since 2000), manufactured by consortium consisting of [[Siemens]], [[ČKD (company)|ČKD Praha]] and [[ADtranz]]. The minimum interval between two trains is 90 seconds.

The original Soviet vehicles "[[Metrovagonmash Ečs|Ečs]]" were excluded in 1997, but one vehicle is placed in public transport museum in depot [[Střešovice]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metroweb.cz/metro/Ecs/Ecs.htm |title=Historická souprava Ečs |publisher=Metroweb.cz |access-date=14 September 2013 |archive-date=19 October 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019170008/http://metroweb.cz/metro/Ecs/Ecs.htm |url-status=live}}</ref> The [[Náměstí Míru]] metro station is the deepest station and is equipped with the longest [[escalator]] in [[European Union]].
