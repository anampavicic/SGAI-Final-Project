==Etymology==
The etymology of the name ''Malang'' is uncertain. One of the theory said that the name Malang is derived from the words ''Malangkuçeçwara'' which means "God has destroyed the false and enforced the right". The words were taken from an ancient term which mentions a legendary temple called ''Malangkuçeçwara'', supposedly located near the city Malang. The word ''Malangkuçeçwara'' was applied as the motto of the city of Malang. The name "Malang" first appeared on the Pamotoh / Ukirnegara Inscription (1120 Saka / 1198 AD) which was discovered on 11 January 1975 by a Bantaran plantation administrator in Wlingi, [[Blitar Regency]]. In the copper inscription, one part is written (with the following translation) as follows.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ngalam.id/read/2515/prasasti-ukir-negara-iii-munculnya-nama-malang/|title=Prasasti Pamotoh (Ukir Negara III): Munculnya Nama Malang|last=nGalamediaLABS|website=ngalam.id|language=id|access-date=18 February 2019}}</ref> {{Verse translation|...taning sakrid Malang-akalihan

Malang here refers to an eastern of [[Mount Kawi]]. Although it is known that the use of Malang has at least been going on since the 12th century, it cannot be ascertained the etymology of its territory.

The first hypothesis refers to the name of a holy building called Malangkuçeçwara ({{IPA|id|malaŋkuʃeʃworo|pron}}). The sacred building is referred to in two Balitung King inscriptions from [[Medang Kingdom|Ancient Mataram]], namely the Mantyasih Inscription in 907 AD and the Inscription of 908 AD.<ref name=":1">M. A. Mihaballo, H. Susanto, & Sriyana (2013). ''The Miracle of Language'', Jakarta: Elex Media Computindo. pp. 201–202</ref> Experts still have not obtained an agreement on where the building is located. On the one hand, there are a number of experts who say that the Malangkuçeçwara building is located in the Mount Buring area, a mountain that stretches east of Malang, where one of its peaks named "Malang".<ref name=":1" /> Others, on the other hand, suspect that the actual location of the sacred building is in the Tumpang area, Malang Regency. In the area, there is a village called Malangsuka, which, according to historians, comes from the word Malangkuça ({{IPA|id|malankuʃoː|pron}}) which is pronounced upside down. This opinion is reinforced by the existence of ancient relics around Tumpang, such as Jago Temple and Kidal Temple, which are in the territory of the [[Singhasari|Kingdom of Singhasari]].<ref name=":1" />

The Malangkuçeçwara name consists of 3 words, namely mala, which means falsehood, cheating, falsehood, and evil, angkuça ({{IPA|id|aŋkuʃo|pron}} which means to destroy or destroy, and içwara ({{IPA|id|iʃworo|pron}}) which means God. Therefore, Malangkuçeçwara means "God has destroyed the vanity".<ref name=":0">Makna Lambang – Pemerintah Kota Malang,' ''Pemerintah Kota Malang'' (daring), https://malangkota.go.id/sekilas-malang/makna-lambang/ diakses pada 21 September 2017</ref>

The second hypothesis refers to the story of the assault of the [[Mataram Sultanate]] forces in Malang in 1614, led by Tumenggung Alap-Alap.<ref>A. P. Rianto (2016), ''Perancangan Konsep Art Game Bergenre Fantasi Malangkucecwara The Ruins of War''. Skripsi. Tidak diterbitkan. Yogyakarta: Institut Seni Indonesia. P. 50</ref> According to folklore, there was a conversation between Tumenggung Alap-Alap and one of his assistants regarding the condition of Malang before the attack began. The assistant from Tumenggung Alap-Alap mentioned residents and soldiers from the area as residents who "blocked the halangi" ("Malang" in Javanese) from the arrival of Mataram troops. After the conquest, the Mataram forces named the area of the conquest as Malang.<ref>W. Siswanto & S. Noersya (2008). ''Cerita Rakyat dari Malang (Jawa Timur)''. Jakarta: Grasindo. pp. 1–8</ref>

==History==
===Early history===
[[File:Miniatur Dataran Tinggi Malang.jpg|left|thumb|283x283px|Miniature of Malang Highlands]]
The Malang area in the [[Pleistocene|Pleistocene era]] was still a [[Oceanic basin|deep basin]] flanked by [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] from mountains such as the Karst Mountains in the south, [[Mount Kawi|Kawi]], [[Mount Butak|Butak]], and [[Kelud]] in the west, Anjasmoro and [[Arjuno-Welirang]] complex in the northeast and north, and the [[Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park|Tengger Mountains Complex]] in the east.<ref>R. W. van Bemmelen (1949). ''The Geology of Indonesia Vol. I''. Den Haag: Martinus-Nijhoff</ref> The basin has not been inhabited by humans because the condition is still in the form of lava and [[Lava|hot lava flows]] from the surrounding mountains.<ref>S. Santosa & T. Suwarti (1992). ''Peta Geologi Lembar Malang, Jawa Timur, skala 1:100.000''. Bandung: Pusat Penelitian dan Pengembangan Geologi</ref> Towards the rainy season, the [[Malang Plain|Malang basin]] is filled with water flowing through the mountain slopes, leading to a number of rivers and forming an ancient [[swamp]]. The swamps spread to create [[ancient lake]]s.

When the ancient lake had not dried up, [[Civilization|early human civilization]] was still in the early to advanced stages of [[Hunting]] and [[Collecting|Collecting Food]]. The settlements are still on the slopes of mountains and mountains that surround Malang in the form of natural caves. Therefore, it is understandable that the discovery of artifacts in the [[paleolithic]] and [[mesolithic]] period is found in mountainous areas, such as on the slopes of Mount Kawi, Arjuno-Welirang, Tengger, [[Semeru]] and the Southern Karst Mountains.<ref name=":2">Dinas Kebudayaan dan Pariwisata Kota Malang (2013). ''Wanwacarita, Kesejarahan Desa-Desa Kuno di Kota Malang''. Malang : Penerbit Dinas Kebudayaan dan Pariwisata Kota Malang. pp. 34–36</ref>

Malang ancient lake gradually dried up in the [[Holocene calendar|Holocene era]] and caused the Malang region to become a plateau in Malang. When it began to enter the [[Agriculture|Planting Period]], early humans began to descend from the mountains and make a number of settlements and agricultural areas. The discovery of a number of artifacts in the form of two square pickaxes, chalcedony stone tools and hand-held andesite axes on the east side of Mount Kawi in the Kacuk area around the Metro and [[Brantas River|Brantas]] streams reinforced this assumption. [8] In addition, the study estimates that the forms of occupancy in the transitional period were in the form of a [[stilt house]], where the body of the house was supported by the legs of the house and was several meters above the ground. This is reinforced by the discovery of artifacts in the form of "Watu Gong" or "Watu Kenong" in Dinoyo, Lowokwaru, Malang, whose forms are similar to traditional musical instruments, namely [[gong]], which are actually swear or foundation of a stilt house.<ref name=":2" /> The growth of settlements around the river flowing in Malang became the forerunner of the ancient civilizations of the [[Homo sapiens]].<ref>Pemerintah Kotamadya Malang (1964). ''Kotapradja Malang 50 Tahun''. Malang : Seksi penerbitan 50 Tahun Kotapradja Malang.</ref>

===Hindu and Islamic Kingdoms===
====Kanjuruhan Kingdom====
The history of [[Malang Regency]] could be revealed through the [[Dinoyo inscription]] at year of 760 as the primary official document to support the birth of Malang before a new inscription was discovered in 1986, which is yet to be deciphered. According to the inscription, it was concluded that the 8th century was the beginning of the existence of Malang Regency's government due to the birth of King Gajayana's ruling of his [[Greater India|Indianized]] [[Hindu]] kingdom in Malang. From the [[Dinoyo inscription]], it is noted that the inscription used the "''Candra Sengkala''" or Cronogram Calendar, and stated that the birth date of Malang Regency was on [[Javanese calendar|Jum'at Legi]] (sweet Friday) of 28 November 760.<ref>L. Damaes: "Studed' Epigraphy d'Indonesia IV. 1952"</ref>

====Mataram Kingdom====
Kanjuruhan Kingdom power is estimated to not last long. The kingdom was finally under the rule of ''Mataram'' ([[Mataram Kingdom|Ancient Mataram Kingdom]]) during the leadership of [[Balitung|King Dyah Balitung]] (899–911 AD). In the Balingawan Inscription (813 Saka / 891 AD), it is mentioned Pu Huntu as ''Rakryan Kanuruhan'' (ruler of Kanuruhan character) in the reign of King Mpu Daksa (911–919 AD).<ref>J. L. A. Brandes (1913). ''Oud-Javaansche Oorkonden: Nagelaten transcripties van willen Dr. JLA Brandes Uitgegeven door Dr. NJ Krom''. Den Haag: Martinus Nijhoff</ref> The area that used to be an autonomous kingdom has dropped one level to a ''watak'' (region) that is on a level with the [[duchy]] or [[district]] (one level under the authority of the [[king]]). ''Watak Kanuruhan'' which covers the center of Malang today is an entity that stands side by side with ''Watak Hujung'' (in Ngujung, Toyomarto Village, [[Singosari|District Singosari]], [[Malang Regency]]) and ''Watak Tugaran'' (in Tegaron, Lesanpuro, Kedungkandang, Malang Regency) which each oversees several ''wanua'' ([[Village|village level]]).<ref>I. Lutfi (2003). Desa-Desa Kuno di Malang Periode Abad ke-9-10 Masehi: Tinjauan Singkat Berbasis Data Tekstual Prasasti dan Toponimi. ''Sejarah, 9(1)''. 28–40</ref>

When the capital Mataram was moved to the Tamwlang and Watugaluh ([[Jombang Regency|Jombang]]) areas during the reign of [[Mpu Sindok|King Mpu Sindok]] (929–948 AD), several inscriptions such as Sangguran, Turyyan, Gulung-Gulung, Linggasutan, Jeru-Jeru, Tija, Kanuruhan, Muncang, and Wurandungan describes a number of tax liability policies for ''sima'' (civil villages) in Malang and a number of land grant processes to build [[Hindu temple|temples]].<ref>'Daftar Tahun Sejarah Malang I,' ''Ngalam.id'' (daring), 21 Januari 2014, http://ngalam.id/read/122/daftar-tahun-sejarah-malang-i/, diakses pada 8 Januari 2019</ref>

====Kahuripan, Janggala, and Kediri Kingdom====
[[File:Kediri Kingdom id.svg|thumb|Division of the [[Kediri Kingdom]] (dark orange) and [[Janggala|Jenggala Kingdom]] (bright orange) before 1135. The boundaries of the two regions are [[Mount Kawi]].]]
There is no record that explains in detail the status and role of the area around Malang during [[Airlangga|King Airlangga's]] leadership in addition to the fact that Malang entered the territory of the [[Kahuripan|Kingdom of Kahuripan]]. Because the Malang area is no longer the center of government of the Kingdom which is centered around [[Mount Penanggungan]] and [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]] with its capital Kahuripan. Even when Raja Airlangga divided Kahuripan into [[Kediri Kingdom|Panjalu]] which was centered in Daha ([[Kediri (city)|Kadiri]]) and Jenggala which remained centered in Kahuripan, the Malang region was included as a peripheral of the powers of both kingdoms. However, it can be ascertained that the Malang region entered the Jenggala region at the time of this division. The division of Kahuripan shows that [[Mount Kawi]] was used as the boundary of the two new kingdoms with the eastern side obtained by Jenggala.

Malang again became an important area in the history of Panjalu or [[Janggala|Jenggala]] when King Jayabhaya of Panjalu conquered [[Janggala|Jenggala]]. In the Hantang Inscription (1057 Saka / 1135 AD), it is written Panjalu Jayati ("''Panjalu Menang''"), signifying Panjalu's victory over Jenggala. The inscription also included the granting of special privileges to several villages in Hantang (Ngantang, [[Malang Regency]]) and its surroundings for their services in favor of Panjalu during the war.<ref>'Prasasti Hantang, Hadiah Raja Jayabhaya untuk Warga Ngantang,' ''Ngalam.co'' (daring), 16 April 2017, https://ngalam.co/2017/04/16/prasasti-hantang-hadiah-raja-jayabhaya-warga-ngantang/, diakses pada 9 Januari 2019</ref> This inscription also shows that the Malang region is under the authority of Panjalu.

The Kamulan Inscription (1116 Saka / 1194 AD) records the events of the attack of an area from the east of Daha (Kadiri) against King Kertajaya (in the [[Pararaton]] called Dandang Gendhis) who resided in the Katang-Katang Kedaton.<ref>'Prasasti Kamulan Kabupaten Trenggalek,' ''Situs Budaya'' (daring), https://situsbudaya.id/prasasti-kamulan-trengalek/, diakses pada 9 Januari 2019</ref> There is no further research on whether the attack was a rebellion or attempted conquest. However, the existence of the Kamulan Inscription shows that there was a new political force that emerged to oppose Panjalu's power. This argument is reinforced by the existence of the Sukun Inscription (1083 Saka / 1161 AD) which mentions a king named Jayamerta who gave special rights to Sukun Village (allegedly in Sukun Sub-District, District Sukun, Malang) for fighting enemies.<ref>Suwardono, S. Rosmiayah, dan Maskur (1997), ''Monografi Sejarah Kota Malang'', Malang: Sigma Media</ref> Jayamerta has never been stated explicitly or implicitly in various records that refer to information regarding both the list of rulers of [[Kediri Kingdom|Kadiri]] and [[Janggala|Jenggala]]. Some historians such as Agus Sunyoto mention that the area of origin of the resistance was named Purwa or Purwwa. This was supported by Sunyoto's argument when referring to all [[Majapahit]] rulers as descendants of [[Ken Arok]] who "[...] drained his seed into the world through teja which emanated from" secrets "Ken Dedes, naraiswari [...] Purwa Kingdom."<ref>A. Sunyoto (2004), ''Sang Pembaharu: Perjuangan dan Ajaran Syaikh Siti Jenar''. Yogyakarta: LKIS Pelangi Aksara. p. 32</ref> "Naraiswari (or nareswari / Ardanareswari) himself in [[Sanskrit]] means "the main woman" and [[Ken Dedes]] himself is the daughter of Mpu Purwa, a [[Brahmin|brahmana]] from Panawijyan (Kelurahan Polowijen, Kecamatan Blimbing, Malang). In the end the resistance effort from the area which was said to be named Purwa / Purwwa was successfully crushed by [[Kediri Kingdom|Panjalu]].

Some historians attribute the series of events of resistance and crackdown to the socio-political context of the two conflicts involving King Kertajaya and the Brahmin class. The first is the policy of King Kertajaya who tried to reduce a number of rights from the Brahmana class. Some folklore shows that King Kertajaya wanted to be "worshiped" by the Brahmins so that it was contrary to the religious teachings of the Brahmins. The second is the kidnapping of Ken Dedes by Tunggul Ametung, akuwu (equivalent to sub-district head) for the Tumapel region.<ref>'Kerajaan Purwwa,' ''Ngalam.id'' (daring), 29 Oktober 2012, http://ngalam.id/read/98/kerajaan-purwwa/, diakses pada 9 Januari 2019</ref> According to Blasius Suprapto, the location of Tumapel itself was in an area formerly called Kutobedah (now called Kotalama, Kedungkandang, Malang).<ref>B. Suprapta (2015), ''Makna Gubahan Ruang Situs-Situs Hindhu-Buddha Masa Sinhasari Abad XII Sampain XIII Masehi di Saujana Dataran Tinggi Malang dan Sekitarnya''. Disertasi. Tidak Dipublikasikan. Yogyakarta: Universitas Gadjah Mada</ref> The implication of the two conflicts was the withdrawal of political support from the Brahmana class against Raja Kertajaya.

====Singhasari Empire====
[[File:Penculikan ken dedes.jpg|thumb|[[Diorama]] of kidnapping [[Ken Dedes]] by Tunggul Ametung at Mpu Purwa Museum, Malang.]]
The collapse of Panjalu / Kadiri and the birth of the Tumapel Kingdom in Malang originated from the [[Brahmin|Brahmana]] class from Panjalu who tried to save himself from political persecution by King Kertajaya. They fled eastward and joined the political forces in Tumapel, led by [[Ken Arok|Ken Angrok or Ken Arok]]. He then rebelled against Akuwu Tunggul Ametung and took control of Tumapel. Ken Arok's victory was at the same time a statement of war to separate himself from Panjalu/Kadiri. The power struggle between Kertajaya and Ken Arok towards the Malang region and its surroundings led to the Battle of Ganter in Ngantang (now a sub-district in [[Malang Regency]]) (1144 Saka / 1222 AD) which was won by Ken Arok. He also ordained himself as the first king of the Kingdom of Tumapel with the title Rajasa Sang Amurwabhumi. The capital itself remained in Tumapel but changed its name to Kutaraja.
[[File:Candi Jago C.JPG|thumb|[[Jago Temple]], a place of worship for King Wisnuwardhana, in Tumpang, Malang Regency]]
During the period of the transfer of the royal capital during the reign of King Wisnuwardhana from Kutaraja to Singhasari (Singosari District, Malang Regency) in 1176 Saka / 1254 AD, there was no comprehensive record of the strategic status of the Malang region in the Tumapel era. There was no explanation for the reasons for the move but starting in this era Singhasari became the name of this kingdom. The remaining data only shows a number of historical places in Malang such as the Gunung Katu area in Genengan (Prangargo, Wagir, Malang Regency) which according to historian Dwi Cahyono is a dharma site,<ref>R. H. Putri, 'Persembahan Terakhir bagi Rajasa,' ''Historia'' (daring), 14 Oktober 2017, https://historia.id/kuno/articles/persembahan-terakhir-bagi-rajasa-PKNGQ, diakses pada 11 Januari 2019</ref> Kidjo Rejo area (Kidal Village, District Tumpang, Malang Regency), where Raja Anusapati was worshiped in Candi Kidal, and the Tumpang area where Raja Wisnuwardhana was dharma in [[Jago Temple]]. Another legacy is the spring of Watugede in Watugede Village, Singosari District, Malang Regency. According to Agus Irianto, the bathing staff of Watugede, Pararaton wrote that this place was often used by Ken Dedes and other prospective women to clean the body. The village elders also believe that in this place Ken Arok also saw the light emanating from the body of Ken Dedes as a sign that he was a nareswari.<ref name=":3">D. A.

During the leadership of Raja Kertanegara, the Kingdom of Singhasari faced a rebellion by Jayakatwang from the bracelet area (around [[Madiun]]).<ref>A. C. Irapta & C. D. Duka (2005). ''Introduction to Asia: History, Culture, and Civilization''. Quezon: Rex Bookstore, Inc.</ref> [[Jayakatwang]] himself is the great-grandson of Raja Kertajaya according to [[Nagarakretagama|Negarakertagama]] and nephew of Raja Wisnuwardhana (from the lineage of women) according to the Mula Malurung Inscription.<ref>S. Muljana (1979). ''Negarakertagama dan Tafsir Sejarahnya''. Jakarta: Bhratara</ref> The rebellion killed Raja Kertanegara, the last king of Singhasari, due to his territory having no defense when most of his military was sent for the [[Pamalayu|Pamalayu Expedition]].<ref>M. Rossabi (1989). ''Khubilai Khan: His Life and Times''.

Coedès (1968). ''The Indianized states of Southeast Asia''. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. p. 199</ref>

====Majapahit Empire====
[[File:Majapahit Core and Provinces.svg|thumb|[[Majapahit]] territory in Java, Malang was capital of ''mancanegara'' ([[province]]) Tumapel.]]
Malang was not the center of the power struggle between [[Jayakatwang]], [[Raden Wijaya]], and [[Kublai Khan|Kublai Khan's]] army from [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]]. After winning the succession of power, Raden Wijaya, who held the title of ''Kertarajasa Jayawardhana'' moved the center of power to the area he had built in the ''Tarik'' Forest (now around [[Mojokerto]] and District Tarik, [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]]). However, the Malang region witnessed history from the fate of Jayakatwang who was exiled to another spring in Polaman (now Kalirejo Village, Lawang District, [[Malang Regency]]). According to Pararaton and Kidung Harsyawijaya, this was where Jayakatwang was inspired to write Wukir Polaman, his last literary work before being executed by Raden Wijaya.<ref name=":3" />

In the [[Majapahit]] government structure according to the Waringin Pitu Inscription (AD 1447), the Malang region is included in the ''Bhumi'' or the [[Capital city|capital]] of empire. He is a ''nagara'' (provincial equivalent) named Tumapel which is led by a ''rajya'' (governor) or ''natha'' (master) or ''bhre'' (nobleman / prince) —such as [[duke]]s.<ref>F. F. Wasitaatmadja (2018). ''Spiritualisme Pancasila''. Jakarta: Prenada Media. pp. 44–45</ref>

Negarakertagama also recorded [[Hayam Wuruk|King Hayam Wuruk's]] visit to several places in the Malang region in 1359 AD.<ref>H. Sidomulyo (2007). ''Napak Tilas Perjalanan Mpu Prapanca''. Jakarta: Wedatama Widya Sastra.</ref> According to Yudi Anugrah Nugroho, the tour was part of a series of trips by King Hayam Wuruk to review the development around [[Lumajang Regency|Lumajang]]. This visit is usually done when the harvest period is over.<ref>Y. A. Nugraha, 'Perjalanan Ziarah Raja Majapahit,' ''Historia'' (daring). 4 Juli 2014, https://historia.id/kuno/articles/perjalanan-ziarah-raja-majapahit-Pe59P, diakses pada 22 Januari 2019</ref> There are at least two contexts of the tour, namely recreation and pilgrimage.<ref>T. G. T. Pigeaud (1963). ''Java in the 14th Century : A Study in Cultural History : The Nāgara-Kertāgama by Rakawi, Prapañca of Majapahit, 1365 A.D. Vol V: Glossary, general index''. Den Haag: Martinus Nijhoff. Meskipun argumen Pigeaud hanya berfokus pada aspek rekreatif dari lawatan tersebut, tidak dipungkiri bahwa terdapat pula aspek rekreatif.</ref> For the recreational context, the first place was Kasuranggan Park in the Sumberawan area (Toyomarto Village, District Singosari, [[Malang Regency]]). It was here that King Hayam Wuruk built a stupa as a place of worship for [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] so that it became the Sumberawan Temple as it is now.<ref>A. J. B. Kempers (1959). ''Ancient Indonesian Art''. Cambridge, MA.: [[Harvard University Press]].</ref> The second is Kedung Biru. Some historians connect Kedung Biru with the location now called ''Dusun Biru'', Gunungrejo Village, [[Singosari|District Singosari]], [[Malang Regency]]. It is called ''kedung'' (meaning: ravine) because it is on the edge of a cliff near the Klampok River. In addition to the recreational place of Raja Hayam Wuruk, it is said that this place is a sanctuary for kris made by [[Mpu Gandring]] and other [[Weapon|royal weapons]]. The third is the Bureng area identified as the [[Wendit]] natural bath in Mangliawan Village, District Pakis, Malang Regency.

For the context of [[pilgrimage]], King Hayam Wuruk visited several heritage temples of the Singhasari Kingdom which aimed to dharma the ancestors ([[Rajasa dynasty|Wangsa Rajasa]]). Some of the temples visited include Kidal Temple (in honor of [[Anusapati|King Anusapati]]), Jago Temple (in honor of King Wisnuwardhana), and Candi Singasari (in honor of Raja Kertanegara). Especially for Singasari Temple, there is debate about whether it was built during the reign of Singhasari or Majapahit Kingdom. Because, according to the National Library of the Republic of Indonesia, Singosari Temple was built around 1300 AD (the reign of King Raden Wijaya) as a temple of respect, if not dharma, Raja Kertanegara along with Jawi Temple.<ref name=":5">Perpustakaan Nasional Republik Indonesia, 'Candi Singosari,' ''Kepustakaan Candi'' (daring), http://candi.perpusnas.go.id/temples/deskripsi-jawa_timur-candi_singasari, diakses pada 22 Januari 2019</ref> However, there is an argument which states that this temple was being built during the reign of King Kertanegara itself as a public worship temple. The consequence of this last argument is that the construction of the temple was not completed due to the occupation of Singhasari by Jayakatwang.<ref name=":5" />

The Malang region (Tumapel) became one of the objects of political conflict when the [[Regreg war]] erupted (1404–1406). This area is claimed by Aji Rajanata, Bhre Wirabhumi II (Blambangan, Banyuwangi). However, the claim was opposed by Manggalawardhana, Bhre Tumapel II, who was still the son of King Hayam Wuruk. Therefore, this area is considered as the frontline of the battle involving Majapahit (West) and Blambangan ('East Majapahit). However, because Regreg war was won by [[Wikramawardhana|King Wikramawardhana]], [[Tumapel]] returned to Majapahit power.<ref name=":5" />

When the Majapahit Kingdom arrived [[Zheng He|Admiral Cheng Ho]] from China ([[Ming dynasty]]) in 1421 AD, he agreed with King [[Wikramawardhana]] (1389–1429 AD) to place Ma Hong Fu and Ma Yung Long as ambassadors of the Ming dynasty at Tumapel.<ref name=":6">D. Mashad (2014). ''Muslim Bali: Mencari Kembali Harmoni yang Hilang''. Jakarta: Pustaka Al-Kautsar</ref> This can be attributed to Admiral Cheng Ho's diplomatic efforts to ensure the security of ethnic Chinese in the Majapahit region. During the [[Paregreg war|War of Regreg]] (1406), around 170 delegates from the Ming dynasty were sent by Admiral Cheng Ho to re-establish diplomatic relations between [[Mongols in China|China]] and Majapahit after the [[Mongol invasion of Java|conflict of the Jayakatwang-Raden Wijaya-Kublai Khan]] in the era of transition from [[Singhasari]] to [[Majapahit]]. However, all the envoys were massacred by King Wikramawardhana who could not distinguish their arrival status as an enemy or not. The role of Admiral Cheng Ho was also significant for the Malang region (Tumapel) in 1432 when he was with his subordinates, Gan Eng Cu and (Duke (''Bhre'') of Arya Teja I of Tuban) and his younger brother, Gan Eng Wan, helped Ratu Maharani Sri Suhita (1429–1447 AD ) to unite Daha (Kadiri) and Tumapel after internal conflict.<ref name=":6" /> For his services, Bro Eng Wan was given the title Raden Arya Suganda was appointed as an official at Tumapel.

====Sengguruh Kingdom====
[[File:Situs Kerajaan Sengguruh.jpg|thumb|[[Tomb]] of Arya Terung, Duke of Sengguruh.]]
Sengguruh is the last [[Greater India|Hindu kingdom]] and the rest of the heritage of [[Majapahit]] sympathizers in Malang. He was an independent kingdom after the fall of Majapahit.<ref>A. Van Schaik (1996). ''Malang: Beeld van een Stad''. Purmerend: Asia Major</ref> [[H. J. de Graaf|Hermanus Johannes de Graff]] argued that the son of the [[Girindrawardhana|Brawijaya VII]], Raden Pramana fled to the remote mountain region in the south<ref>T. B. T. Pigeaud (1976). ''Islamic States in Java 1500–1700: Eight Dutch Books and Articles by Dr H.J. de Graaf''. Leiden: KITLV</ref> due to the occupation of Daha (Kadiri) (capital of Majapahit since [[Girindrawardhana|Girindrawardhana – Brawijaya VI]]) by Sultan Trenggana from [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] in 1527. The leader of this region is Arya Terung with the title Adipati Sengguruh. The name Sengguruh is said to be related to the existence of an education center and the residence of the knights or banner (commonly called Kepanjian or Kepanjen area). The banners who want to study in Kepanjen are said to be saying "Let's go to the Teacher" which refers to the place where they study. These words gradually became Sengguruh.<ref>'Kerajaan Sengguruh, Penerus Tahta Majapahit di Malang,' ''Ngalam.co'' (daring), 3 Mei 2017, https://ngalam.co/2017/05/03/kerajaan-sengguruh-penerus-tahta-majapahit-malang/, diakses pada 23 Januari 2019</ref>

According to ''Babad ing Gresik'' (Chronicles of Gresik), the kingdom had tried to attack the [[Lamongan Regency|Lamongan]] and [[Gresik Regency|Giri (Gresik)]] areas in 1535. However, the efforts of Arya Terung were unsuccessful, if not failed to maintain their occupation of the two regions.<ref name=":7">'Kerajaan Sengguruh,' ''Ngalam.id'' (daring), 20 November 2012, http://ngalam.id/read/152/kerajaan-sengguruh/ diakses pada 23 Januari 2019</ref> In fact, according to the records in Tedhak Dermayudan, after the failure of the conquest, Arya Terung adopted [[Islam]] and spread [[Islamic studies|Islamic teachings]] throughout Sengguruh.<ref name=":7" /> As a result, the Majapahit sympathizers led by Raden Pramana rebelled and made the Arya Terung flee north around the lower reaches of the [[Brantas River]]. With the help of Sultan Trenggana who had conquered the former capital of the [[Singhasari|Singhasari Empire]] in 1545. Sengguruh succeeded in quelling the rebellion. Raden Pramana fled towards [[Blambangan Kingdom|Blambangan]]. In Serat Kanda, Sultan Trenggana once again appointed Arya Terung as Duke of Sengguruh which was under the Demak Sultanate. In addition, the Malang area after the conquest of Sultan Trenggana changed to Kutho Bedah ("The Destructed City").<ref>Amiany (2005). ''Perkembangan Struktur Ruang Kota Malang Tahun 1767–2001''.

===Dutch East Indies===

The city was capital city of [[Singhasari]] in 1222, then transferred to [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colony. Malang was modernized under the Dutch; its mild climate which results from its elevation, along with its proximity to the major port of [[Surabaya]], made it a popular destination for the Dutch and other Europeans. Malang began to grow and develop rapidly and various economic sectors of the community were increasing, especially the need for space to carry out various activities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mediacenter.malangkota.go.id/2011/04/serba-serbi-kota-malang/#axzz4ylkOU0aR|title=SERBA-SERBI KOTA MALANG {{!}} {{!}} Media Center Kendedes – Info Publik Kota Malang|website=mediacenter.malangkota.go.id|language=id-ID|access-date=18 November 2017}}</ref> As a result, there was a change in land use which was marked by a built up area that appeared uncontrollably. Changes in land functions undergo rapid changes, such as from functioning land agriculture becomes a functioning land of housing and industry. [[History of rail transport in Indonesia|In 1879, Malang was connected to Java's railroad network]], further increasing development and leading to increased industrialization. On 1 April 1914, Malang was designated ''gemeente'' (city).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://malang.merdeka.com/gaya-hidup/menelusuri-langkah-awal-103-tahun-berdirinya-kota-malang-1703315.html|title=Menelusuri langkah awal 103 tahun berdirinya kota Malang|newspaper=Malang - Merdeka.com|access-date=1 December 2017}}</ref>

===Japanese occupation===

During the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies|Japanese occupation in Indonesia]], Malang was also occupied by Japan. [[Imperial Japanese Army]] began occupying Malang on 7 March 1942. Malang, which was then led by Raden Adipati Ario Sam (R.A.A. Sam), surrendered to the Japanese who were then in power in Malang. Taking over the Government in principle continues the old system (Gemeente), only the designations in positions are replaced with [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2013-10-26 |title=Sejarah Malang Pra Kemerdekaan dan Kemerdekaan (Bagian 5) |url=https://www.jurnalmalang.com/2013/10/sejarah-malang-pra-kemerdekaan-bagian-5.html |access-date=2023-08-04 |language=id}}</ref> During the Japanese occupation there was a shift in the function of local buildings. The houses where the Dutch lived were transferred to Japanese use. The Dutch building on Jalan Semeru (which was used as an office or the headquarters of the Dutch troops,) was converted into a Kempetai building and a [[Ching Nan Shrine|Shinto shrine]] was also built in the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ngalam.co/2017/07/10/pernah-ada-kuil-shinto-di-kota-malang/|title=Pernah Ada Kuil Shinto di Kota Malang|last=Akaibara|date=10 July 2017|website=Ngalam.co|language=id-ID|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190220074856/https://ngalam.co/2017/07/10/pernah-ada-kuil-shinto-di-kota-malang/|archive-date=20 February 2019|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref> The Kentapetai building became one of the historical buildings in Malang, which is now a private vocational school building and witnesses the disarmament of the Japanese by the [[People's Security Agency]] (BKR) in order to strengthen the defence of Malang.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bayu |first=Safril |date=13 November 2014 |title=Jejak Masa Kolonial dan Pendudukan Jepang di Kota Malang |url=http://www.geschool.net/cysers/blog/jejak-masa-kolonial-dan-pendudukan-jepang-di-kota-malang |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022141954/http://www.geschool.net/cysers/blog/jejak-masa-kolonial-dan-pendudukan-jepang-di-kota-malang |archive-date=2017-10-22 |access-date=2023-08-04 |website=Geschool |via=[[Archive.org]]}}</ref>

Chinese businessman, investor, and philanthropist [[Tan Kah Kee]]  who's based in Singapore before the war. He was responsible for gathering much financial support from the community to aid China in the war. I fled to Malang and went hidden until the war is over. In 1943, while he was in Java, Tan began writing his memoirs, The Memoirs of an Overseas Chinese of the Southern Ocean (南僑回憶錄; 南侨回忆录; Nánqiáo Huíyìlù), which later became an important document of the history of the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia.

===Independence of Indonesia===
After [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|Independence of Indonesia]] in 1945, Malang became part of the Republic of Indonesia on 21 September 1945 and re-entered on 2 March 1947 after being re-occupied by the [[Dutch East Indies]]. The government was changed to Malang City Government on 1 January 2001 based on second amendments of [[Constitution of Indonesia|Indonesia's Constitution]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://malangkota.go.id/sekilas-malang/sejarah-malang/|title=Sejarah Malang|website=Pemerintah Kota Malang|language=id-ID|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref>

Along with growth came urbanization. The government could not satisfy the population's needs for affordable housing, which led to the building of [[shanty towns]] along the rivers and rail tracks. Today, the shanty towns still exist; although some have been transformed into "better" housing.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://republika.co.id/berita/nasional/daerah/17/02/10/ol4fs9284-kota-malang-masih-hadapi-permukiman-kumuh|title=Kota Malang Masih Hadapi Permukiman Kumuh|date=10 February 2017|website=Republika Online|language=id|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316175230/https://republika.co.id/berita/nasional/daerah/17/02/10/ol4fs9284-kota-malang-masih-hadapi-permukiman-kumuh|archive-date=16 March 2018|access-date=20 February 2019}}</ref>

Up until the 14th century, Malang was part of an [[Greater India|Indianized]] majority [[Hindu]]-[[Buddhist]] kingdom like most of Java. Now a majority of Malang residents are Muslims. There are  minorities of Protestants, Catholics, Hindus, Buddhists and Confucians.

Many buildings of worship still stand from their construction in the colonial era. For example, the [[Great Mosque of Malang|City of Malang Grand Mosque]] (''Masjid Agung Jami Kota Malang'' —  مسجد ملانغ الكبير) in Malang City Square (''Alun-alun Kota Malang''); the Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus (''Gereja Katolik Hati Kudus Yesus'') in Kayutangan; [[Cathedral of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Malang|Saint Mary from Mount Carmel Cathedral]] (''Gereja Ijen'' or ''Katedral Santa Maria dari Gunung Karmel'') on Jalan Ijen, which is the seat for the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Malang]]; the Immanuel Protestant Church in Alun-alun; and Eng An Kiong Confucian Temple (''Klenteng Eng An Kiong'' —  永安宮廟) in Jl. Laksamana Martadinata No. 1 Malang.

Malang is famous for being a center of religious education. This is evident with the existence of many Islamic schools (madrasahs and ''pesantren'') and Christian bible seminaries. Malang has several convents and monasteries: Carmel Monastery, Ursuline Convent, Misericordia monastery, Monastery of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart Brothers, Convent of the Sisters of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Monastery Mission Congregatio Brother, Brother Abbey Projo, Passionist Monastery, and several others.
