==History==

===Dutch Formosa===
During the [[Dutch Formosa]] era, ''Ponkan'' (modern-day [[Beigang, Yunlin|Beigang]]) was an important coastal castle.<ref name="gov-hist">{{cite web|title=Historical Evolution|url=http://www.yunlin.gov.tw/english/content/index.asp?m=1&m1=15&m2=82&gp=67|website=The Roots of Yunlin|publisher=Yunlin County Government|access-date=17 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806062315/http://www.yunlin.gov.tw/english/content/index.asp?m=1&m1=15&m2=82&gp=67|archive-date=6 August 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Qing Dynasty===
Yunlin County was established during the [[Qing Dynasty]]. [[Liu Mingchuan]] was in charge of Taiwan, which had been divided into three counties since 1683, Yunlin being part of [[Zhuluo County]]. Mountains made transportation and communication between bordering counties ([[Changhua County|Changhua]] and [[Chiayi County|Chiayi]]) difficult, so Liu suggested a new county, called Yunlin, for easier management. In 1887, Yunlin became one of the four counties of the new [[Taiwan Prefecture]].<ref name="gov-hist"/>

===Empire of Japan===
During [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Japanese rule]], Yunlin (as ''Unrin'') County was again abolished due to the resistance from the local people and combined with [[Tainan Prefecture]]. However, {{nihongo|Toroku Town|斗六街||modern-day [[Douliu]]}} continued to be an important city of central Taiwan.

===Republic of China===
The Yunlin area remained under [[Tainan County]] after the [[Retrocession Day|handover of Taiwan from Japan]] to the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] on 25 October 1945.<ref>{{cite news|date=1 February 2011|url=https://taiwantoday.tw/news.php?unit=4,29,31,45&post=6187|title=Rezoning Taiwan|publisher=Taiwan Today|access-date=9 December 2020}}</ref> On 16 August 1950, '''Yunlin County''' was separated from Tainan County, with [[Douliu]] [[Township (Taiwan)|Township]] as the county seat. On 25 December 1981, Douliu Township was upgraded to a [[county-administered city]]. Yunlin is the only county on Taiwan island without a city of the same name. Like the rest of Taiwan, Yunlin is nominally a part of [[Taiwan Province]], Republic of China, although the provincial level of government is functionally obsolete.<ref>{{cite web |author=Sherry Hsiao |date=29 June 2018 |title=Provincial-level agencies to be defunded next year |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2018/06/29/2003695750 |access-date=29 May 2021 |website=Taipei Times}}</ref>
