==History==
{{main|Udaipur State|History of Udaipur}}

===Prehistoric Era===

The [[Ahar River]] bank was inhabited in about 2000 BCE. There are footprints of two different civilizations, which provides claims about earliest inhabitants of the Ahar culture: the first ones are the [[Bhil people|Bhil]]/Bheels, the indigenous tribes originated at this place, and are still residing in the area in large numbers. The second footprints were of [[Rajput]]s, who once entered the enclosed valley, and then continued to live in this place for centuries.<ref name="Udaipurtimes">{{cite web|title=Prehistoric Era of Ayad|url=http://udaipurtimes.com/prehistoric-era-of-ayad/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101015043216/https://udaipurtimes.com/prehistoric-era-of-ayad/|website=UdaipurTimes.com|date=12 October 2010|access-date=12 September 2017|archive-date=15 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>

===Establishment as a city===
[[File: Statue of Maharana Pratap of Mewar, commemorating the Battle of Haldighati, City Palace, Udaipur.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Statue of [[Maharana Pratap]] of Mewar, commemorating the Battle of Haldighati.]]
Udaipur was founded in 1559,<ref name="Udaipur history"></ref> by Maharana [[Udai Singh II]] in the fertile circular Girwa Valley to the southwest of [[Nagda]], on the [[Banas River]]. The city was established as the new capital of the [[Udaipur State|Mewar kingdom]]. This area already had a thriving trading town, Ayad, which had served as the capital of Mewar in the 10th through 12th centuries.<ref name="Udaipur history"></ref> The Girwa region was thus already well known to Chittorgarh rulers who moved to it whenever the vulnerable tableland Chittaurgarh was threatened with enemy attacks. Rana Udai Singh II, in the wake of the 16th-century emergence of artillery warfare, decided during his exile at [[Kumbhalgarh Fort]] to move his capital to a more secure location. Ayad was flood-prone, hence he chose the ridge east of Pichola Lake to start his new capital city, where he came upon a [[hermit]] while hunting in the foothills of the [[Aravalli Range]]. In the myth, the hermit blessed the king and guided him to build a palace on the spot, assuring him it would be well protected. Udai Singh II consequently established a residence on the site. In November 1567, the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]] [[Siege of Chittorgarh (1567–1568)|conquered Chittor]]. To protect his territory from attack, Rana Udai Singh built a six-kilometre-long city wall, with seven gates,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Manishika|title=GIS and Remote Sensing Techniques|publisher=Examrace.com, 2009|isbn=978-81-7906-190-9|page=36|edition=2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2-ywPPUdIZUC&q=eight+gates+in+udaipur|access-date=17 May 2016|year=2009}}</ref> namely [[Surajpole (Udaipur)|Surajpole]], [[Chandpole (Udaipur)|Chandpole]], [[Udiapole]], [[Hathipole (Udaipur)|Hathipole]], Ambapole, Brahmpole, Delhi Gate, and Kishanpole. The area within these walls and gates is still known as the old city or the walled city.

In September 1576, [[Akbar]] himself arrived at Udaipur and remained there for 6 months until May 1577.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00701022%26ct%3D118|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170814022907/https://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00701022%26ct%3D118|title=The Akbarnama of Abu Fazl|archive-date=14 August 2017|access-date=14 August 2017|url-status=dead|work=persian.packhum.org}}</ref> In 1615, Rana Amar Singh accepted vassalship to Mughal rule under Emperor [[Jahangir]] and [https://vkdigitalsolution.com/ Udaipur] remained the capital of the state, which became a [[princely state]] of [[British India]] in 1818.

Udaipur with its lakes lies on the south slope of the [[Aravalli Range]] in Rajasthan. The northern part of the district consists generally of elevated plateaus, while the eastern part has vast stretches of fertile plains. The southern part is covered with rocks, hills and dense forest. There are two important passages in the Aravali ranges viz. [[Desuri]] Nal and Saoke which serves as a link between Udaipur and [[Jodhpur District]].<ref name="dcmsme">{{cite web|title=Brief Industrial Profile of Udaipur District|url=http://dcmsme.gov.in/dips/DIPR_Udaipur.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130124223615/http://dcmsme.gov.in/dips/DIPR_Udaipur.pdf|archive-date=24 January 2013|access-date=24 January 2013|website=dcmsme.gov.in|publisher=Development Commissioner via [[Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises]]|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The lakes of the city being interconnected form a lake system which supports and sustains the groundwater recharge, water availability for drinking, agriculture, industries and is a source of employment through tourism. The lake system has three main lakes in its upper catchment area, six lakes within its municipal boundary and one lake in the downstream. The Udaipur lake system, arising out of the river Berach (Banas Basin) and its tributaries, is an integral component of the upper Berach basin.
