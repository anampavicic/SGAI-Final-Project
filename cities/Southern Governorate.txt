{{Politics of Bahrain}}
The '''Southern Governorate''' ({{Langx|ar|المحافظة الجنوبية|Al-Muḥāfaẓat al-Janūbīyah}}) has the largest area of the four [[governorates of Bahrain]]. It includes parts of [[Bahrain]]'s old municipalities – [[Al Mintaqah al Gharbiyah]], [[Ar Rifa' wa al Mintaqah al Janubiyah]], and [[Hawar Islands|Juzur Hawar]] (the Hawar Islands). It has the second smallest population of the governorates on Bahrain after [[Al Muharraq Governorate|Al Muharraq]].

The Governor of the Southern Governorate is Shaikh [[Khalifa bin Ali Al Khalifa]] (born 1993), the grandson of former Prime Minister Prince [[Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa]] and the son of Shaikh [[Ali bin Khalifa Al Khalifa]], the deputy prime minister.
