[[File:Area Metropolitana Cochabamba.png|thumb|right|200px|Map showing the location of Quillacollo]]
'''Quillacollo''' is the capital of [[Quillacollo Province]] in [[Cochabamba Department]], [[Bolivia]]. The municipality was established on 14 September 1905 under the Presidency of Ismail Montes.<ref name=queda>{{Cite news | last = Camacho G. | first = Zulma | title = Lo que queda de Quillacollo tras crisis de 7 años | work = Opinión | access-date = 2011-12-16 | date = 2011-12-16 | url = http://www.opinion.com.bo/opinion/articulos/2011/1216/noticias.php?id=35556 }}</ref>

==Population and growth==
The city of Quillacollo is located {{convert|13|km|mi|abbr=on}} westward of [[Cochabamba]] City. Quillacollo's population is 74,980 based on the 2001 [[census]].<ref>[http://world-gazetteer.com/wg.php?x=1208644350&men=gcis&lng=en&des=wg&geo=-38&srt=npan&col=adhoq&msz=1500&geo=-729 World-Gazetteer] {{dead link|date=July 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> The National Statistics Institute estimated in 2010 that the population had grown unexpectedly rapidly to approximately 142,724.<ref name=queda />  The increase in population makes Quillacollo the second fastest growing city in Bolivia after [[El Alto]] in [[La Paz]].

Quillacollo City is one of the various provincial capitals around Cochabamba City, which are increasingly swallowed by the extending perimeter of "greater" Cochabamba (city).

Quillacollo is linked to the city of Cochabamba through the Avenida Blanco Galindo, a particularly busy stretch on the main national highway. Quillacollo is mostly a market town with a sizable agricultural [[hinterland]], but also hosts some relevant industry and a district court which supports a relevant population of lawyers.

==Festivals==
[[File:Calvario de la Virgen María de Urqupiña IV.JPG|thumb|A view of the calvary of the [[Virgin of Urqupiña]] with pilgrims during the festival on August 16.]]

The ''[[Virgen de Urqupiña]]'' festival is held annually on August 15. It is officially dubbed the "Festival of National Integration" and sees a host of different activities, ranging from an extended folkloric spectacle, over a central Mass, generally attended by the Bolivian president and other authorities, to a huge popular [[pilgrimage]] in the course of which people profess their [[Catholic]] [[faith]], but also engage in rituals which are commonly seen as standing in an uneasy relationship with [[Catholic]] [[orthodoxy]] at best, or being outright [[Paganism|pagan]]. People pray and offer promises to the [[Mary the mother of Christ|Virgin]] of Urqupiña for money, health and luck. People greet ''pachamama'' (mother earth) with alcohol and food, burying or spilling it on the floor. A curious rite held on this festivity is extracting rocks from a hill near the sanctuary of the Virgin, whether the rock is big or small, it has to be taken home with the people who cracked the rocky hill to get it, who must return it the next year, as a symbolic act to ask the Virgin to lend them something (like health, money, luck etc.).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PJGB1gKqVIw |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211221/PJGB1gKqVIw |archive-date=2021-12-21 |url-status=live|title = Bolivia: Believers of the Virgin of Urkupina break rocks to ask for favours during a religious…}}{{cbignore}}</ref> 

The Urqupiña festival is annually attended by hundreds of thousands of faithful and national and international tourists, and it is one of the biggest events of popular [[religiosity]] in [[South America]]. Stretched out in preparations and aftermath over the entire month of August, the central days of the Urkupiña festival are August 14 to 16.  While it falls on the same day as the [[Feast of the Assumption]], and so mirrors other Marian celebrations elsewhere, Urqupiña has spawned a variety of offshoots in other parts of the world, such as [[Argentina]], [[Virginia]] (USA), [[Spain]], and [[Sweden]], and wherever a sufficient number of followers of the Marian basilica of Quillacollo dwell.

However, in addition to the pagan religions, Protestantism also stands against the orthodoxy of the Church of Rome in Quillacollo, with various denominations represented, one of which is the [[reformed baptist]] tradition, by the Iglesia de Quillacollo.

==The city==

The [[architecture]] of the city has a [[post-colonial]] blend. Contemporary architecture is seen in modern houses and buildings.

[[Gastronomy]] in the city is varied. Several restaurants are found in the city's streets. The city also offers electronic artifacts cheaper than in Cochabamba.

One of Quillacollo's main economic resources is [[tourism]]. Quillacollo has [[hotel]]s and [[hostel]]s to stay. [[Flea market]]s and informal commerce abound in the city, especially during the festivities. Sunday is market day.
