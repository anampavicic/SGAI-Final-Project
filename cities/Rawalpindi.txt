== Etymology ==
The origin of the name may derive from [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] words "''rāwal"'' ({{lang|pnb|{{nq|راول}}}}) meaning "lake" and "''pinḍ"'' ({{lang|pnb|{{nq|پِنڈ}}}}) meaning "village". The combination of the two words thus means "the village on the lake".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Do you know in which year Rawalpindi cantonment was established? {{!}} Pakistan Cities, Towns and Villages {{!}} PrideofPakistan.com |url=https://www.prideofpakistan.com/pakistan-city-details/Do-you-know-in-which-year-Rawalpindi-cantonment-was-established/19#:~:text=The%20word%20Rawalpindi%20consists%20of,means%20the%20village%20of%20lake. |access-date=30 July 2023 |website=www.prideofpakistan.com |language=en}}</ref>

Another explanation is that Rawalpindi literally means the "Village of Rawals" as it occupies the site of an old village inhabited by the Rawals, a group of [[yogi]]s ([[Asceticism|ascetics]]).<ref>{{Cite web |date=28 July 2023 |title=Rawalpindi {{!}} City, Pakistan, & Population {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Rawalpindi |access-date=30 July 2023 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica |language=en}}</ref> Some accounts propose that a group of yogis arrived in this area with their leader, a head yogi named 'Rawal', and settled here with their followers.

== History ==
=== Origins ===
The region around Rawalpindi has been inhabited for thousands of years. Rawalpindi falls within the ancient boundaries of [[Gandhara]], and is thus in a region containing many Buddhist ruins. In the region north-west of Rawalpindi, traces have been found of at least 55 [[stupa]]s, 28 Buddhist monasteries, 9 temples, and various artifacts in the [[Kharoshthi]] script.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tK-nRXoQ40oC&pg=PA262 |title=Buddhist Sects in India |first=Nalinaksha |last=Dutt |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |year=1998 |isbn=978-8120804289 |access-date=4 January 2020 |archive-date=19 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200819230620/https://books.google.com/books?id=tK-nRXoQ40oC&pg=PA262 |url-status=live}}</ref>

Social structures in Rawalpindi's historic core centre around neighbourhoods, each known as a ''Mohallah''. Each neighbourhood is served by a nearby bazaar (market) and mosque, which in turn serves as a place where people can gather for trade and manufacturing.<ref name="Hull 2013">Hull, M. S. (2013). "Government of Paper: The Materiality of Bureaucracy in Urban Pakistan", University of California Press.</ref> Each ''Mohallah'' has narrow ''gallies'' (streets), and the grouping of houses around short lanes and cul-de-sacs lends a sense of privacy and security to residents of each neighbourhood.{{original research inline|date=March 2019}} Major intersections in the neighbourhood are each referred to as a ''chowk''.

Rawalpindi is relatively a new city contrasted with Pakistan's millennia-old cities such as [[Lahore]], [[Multan]], and [[Peshawar]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Kenoyer |first=Jonathan M. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DK3tAAAAMAAJ&q=major+ancient++cities+of+pakistan |title=Ancient Cities of the Indus Valley Civilization |date=1998 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-577940-0 |language=en}}</ref> South of Rawalpindi's historic core, and across the Lai Nullah, are the wide lanes of the Rawalpindi Cantonment. With tree-lined avenues and historic architecture, the cantonment was the main European area developed during British colonial rule. British colonialists also built the Saddar Bazaar south of the historic core, which served as a retail center geared towards Europeans in the city. Beyond the cantonment are the large suburban housing developments that serve as bedroom communities for Islamabad's commuter population.<ref name="Hull 2013" />

== Demographics ==
The population of Rawalpindi is 2,098,231 in 2017. 84% of the population is [[Punjabis|Punjabi]], 9% is [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]], and 7% is from other ethnic groups.
