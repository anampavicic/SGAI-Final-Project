==Mbarara Bypass Road==
{{Main|Mbarara Northern bypass road}}

As part of the modernisation of the [[Katuna|Mbarara-Katuna Road]] (2011 - 2015), a new northern bypass road is planned for the town. The bypass will start from the [[Coca-Cola]] Plant on [[Masaka|Mbarara-Masaka Road]] at [[Makenke]], pass through Rwebishuri and Nkokonjeru and join the [[Kabale|Mbarara-Kabale Road]] at Katatumba Resort, about {{convert|5|km|mi}} southwest of the central business district. The bypass is expected to decongest the city centre by taking the long-distance trucks destined for and coming from [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] off of Mbarara's city streets. The {{convert|14|km|mi}} road is expected to cost about €170 million (US$210 million), of which the [[European Union]] is expected to lend about €122 million (US$153 million) with the [[Government of Uganda|government]] funding the balance from its own resources.<ref>{{cite web|date=26 May 2010 |access-date=10 June 2019 |title=Mbarara Gets Sh459 Billion Bypass | url=https://www.newvision.co.ug/new_vision/news/1289569/mbarara-sh459b-bypass |newspaper=[[New Vision]] |author=Aidah Nanyonjo | location=Kampala}}</ref>
