[[File:Skyline of Kakamigahara01.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Skyline]] of Kakamigahara]]
{{nihongo|'''Kakamigahara'''|各務原市|Kakamigahara-shi}} is a city located in southern [[Gifu Prefecture]] in Japan. {{As of|2019|01|01}}, the city had an estimated [[population]] of 148,225, and a [[population density]] of 1700 persons per km<sup>2</sup>, in 59,736 households.<ref>[http://www.city.kakamigahara.lg.jp/ Kakamigahara city official home statistics]{{in lang|ja}}</ref> The total area of the city was {{convert|87.81|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

Situated in the northern part of the [[Nōbi Plain]], what is now Kakamigahara originally thrived as a [[shukuba|post station]] on the [[Nakasendō]] highway connecting [[Edo]] with [[Kyoto]], being called "[[Unuma-juku]]" at the time.  In more recent history, the city developed due to the [[Gifu Air Field|JASDF Gifu base]].  In addition, Kakamigahara grew as an industrial city and a [[suburb|commuter suburb]] of Gifu City and Nagoya.

The city of Kakamigahara has many large parks, the most notable among them being "Kakamigahara Kōen", which was originally made from a vacant lot owned by [[Gifu University]].  A city planning policy of making Kakamigahara into a "park city" has been undertaken by the municipality, and in 2005, the city received the Green City Prize from the prime minister. Although the city was officially named Ka'''k'''ami'''ga'''hara, it is also called Ka'''k'''amihara, Ka'''g'''amihara, or Ka'''g'''ami'''ga'''hara by tradition.

==Geography==

[[File:Sinsakariv.JPG|thumb|200px|The banks of the Shin-Sakai River in spring]]
[[File:Ogase-Ike-Kakamigahara01.JPG|thumb|200px|Ogase Reservoir]]
Mountainous terrain runs from the northern to the eastern part of the city.  The [[Kiso River]] flows through the southern part, forming the municipal and prefectural (Aichi-Gifu) border.  A large portion of the city is situated on the Kakamigahara Plateau.  Because the soil is very well drained, it was not traditionally suited to rice cultivation.  With the exception of [[Shukuba|rest stops]] such as [[Unuma-juku]] or other roadside settlements, though, the area was largely wilderness until the [[Meiji period]]. The names of the Meitetsu train stations, Rokken, Nijukken, and the Ogase Reservoir are from that era.  Beginning from the Meiji period, to take advantage of the large amount of wilderness and well-drained soil, military bases and training grounds were established.  In addition, Gifu University's agricultural and engineering departments were established in the area, leading the growth of machine and textile factories.  These industries, in addition to carrot production, which used the dry soil, became the main industries of the town. Part of the city is within the borders of the [[Hida-Kisogawa Quasi-National Park]].

===Climate===
The city has a climate characterized by hot and humid summers, and mild winters ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Cfa'').  The average annual temperature in Kakamigahara is 15.5&nbsp;°C. The average annual rainfall is 1939&nbsp;mm, with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 27.9&nbsp;°C, and lowest in January, at around 3.9&nbsp;°C.<ref>[https://en.climate-data.org/location/764622/ Kakamigahara climate data]</ref>

==History==
The area around Kakamigahara was part of traditional [[Mino Province]].  During the post-[[Meiji restoration]] cadastral reforms, the area was organised into Inaba District, Gifu in April 1897.

'''1 April 1963:'''  Kakamigahara City was founded by amalgamating Naka, Sohara, Unuma, and Inaba.

'''1968:''' The Line Bridge was completed.  Together with the Inuyama bridge, completed in 1925, these two bridges span the Kiso River and connect Kakamigahara City with Aichi Prefecture.

'''1969:''' The Aigi bridge was completed.  This was the third bridge to span the Kiso, and connects the city to Aichi Prefecture.  It was the first bridge to connect Kakamigahara to Konan City.

'''5 March 1986:'''  The section of the Tokai-Hokoriku Expressway between Kakamigahara Junction and Mino Junction was opened.  Furthermore, on 13 December 1998, the Tokai-Hokoriku Expressway was connected to the Meishin Expressway (Ichinomiya Junction).

'''28 March 2000:''' The twinning of the Inuyama Bridge was completed.  Previously, Meitetsu trains had shared the bridge with automobiles, crossing the bridge in a manner similar to streetcars.  After the twinning, the trains began to use the old Inuyama Bridge.  This separation of trains and automobiles improved transportation across the river.

'''1 November 2004:''' Kawashima-cho (Hashima District), was incorporated in Kakamigahara City.

'''5 November 2006:''' The Shin-mei Ko-ami Bridge, connecting to Konan, is completed.

'''24 March 2013:''' Kakamigahara Bridge is completed.  It connects the city hall area with Kawashima-chiku (formerly Kawashima-cho) of Konan City.  With the completion of this bridge, there are now four routes from Kakamigahara City into Aichi Prefecture.
