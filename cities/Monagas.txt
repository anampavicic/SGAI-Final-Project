'''Monagas State''' ({{langx|es|Estado Monagas}}, {{IPA|es|esˈtaðo moˈnaɣas|IPA}}) is one of the 23 [[states of Venezuela|states]] of [[Venezuela]].
[[File:Paisaje Caripe.JPG|thumb|Rural landscape in Monagas]]
Monagas State covers a total surface area of {{cvt|28,900|km2}} and, as of the 2011 census, had a population of 905,443.

Monagas State is surrounded by [[Sucre State]] in the north, [[Anzoátegui State]] in the west and south, [[Bolívar State (Venezuela)|Bolívar State]] in the south, [[Delta Amacuro State]] in the south and east and the [[Paria Gulf]] in the northeast.

The state is named after the general and president of Venezuela [[José Tadeo Monagas]], native from this state, and his brother and fellow president [[José Gregorio Monagas]], native from the neighbor Anzoátegui State.

The capital of the state is [[Maturín]].

== History ==

===Pre-colonial period===
Monagas dates back to the settlement of the territory by indigenous people of different ethnic groups hundreds of years ago, among which are the [[Warao people|Warao]] and [[Kalina people|Kalina]] people, who mainly settled in the [[Orinoco Delta]], and the {{Ill|Chaima people|es|Chaima|ca|Chaima}} people in the north of the state. The first aboriginal people to found a presence in the northern part of the region were the Chaima people belonging to the Capaya tribe.

Although settlement of the territory was slow, archaeological excavations and observations by the chroniclers of the Indies point to the existence of a well-developed village in Barrancas in 1530, when the [[conquistador]] [[Diego de Ordaz]] passed through the area in search of [[El Dorado]]. Also in the 16th century, missionaries arrived in the highlands and slowly the [[Christianization|Christianisation]] and re-education of the Indians spread to the south; they thus adapted to a more sedentary life.

In the site where Barrancas is located today, archaeological objects and utensils have been found that belonged to the so-called [[Barrancoid people|Barrancoid]] and [[Saladoid]] cultures, the oldest of which have been dated to 1000 years before the Christian era. The archaeological evidence that has been found (and that is still being found) has made it possible to establish that Barrancas has been uninterruptedly inhabited at least since the 11th century, which makes it the oldest town in Venezuela and one of the oldest in the American continent.

===Spanish colonization===
[[File:IGLESIA DE GUANAGUANA 2.jpg|thumb|St. Michael the Archangel Colonial Church, a historical monument in Venezuela]]
Diego de Ordaz, a Spanish explorer obsessed with finding the legendary site of El Dorado, arrived in the village in August 1531 after traveling up the Orinoco River via the [[Caño Manamo]]. Impressed by its number of inhabitants – which he estimated at "more than 400 {{Lang|es|bohíos}}" ('huts') – he decided to go down and meet personally with the [[cacique]] Naricagua, lord of his territories, whose name of the river Uyapari was associated with the village. The chronicler [[Juan de Castellanos]], in his ''[[Elegías de varones ilustres de Indias]]'' ('''Elegies of Illustrious Men of the Indies''<nowiki/>'), describes it as "a powerful town of great people that on the ravines was placed the Cacique of Uyapari lordship".{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

The [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] missionary Friar Gerónimo de Muro, with the help of the Carib (Kalina), Cuaca and Chaima people, founded the town of {{Ill|San Antonio de Maturín|es|4=fr|6=pt}}, also known as San Antonio de Capayacuar, on 7 August 1713.

On 20 April 1731, the Aragonese friar Antonio de Blesa founded Santo Domingo de Guzmán de Caycuar; the area was inhabited by Chaima people and outcasts when the Capuchin missionaries arrived. The settlement would later be called [[Caicara de Maturín]].

A Catholic mission of Chaima Indians with the Capuchin missionary Pedro de Gelsa founded the San Miguel Arcangel de Caripe settlement on 12 October 1734, which would later become [[Caripe]].

Maturín was founded on 7 December 1760 by the Capuchin friar Lucas de Zaragoza.

The territory where [[Aguasay Municipality, Monagas|Aguasay]] is now located was founded in 1769 by Friar Manuel de La Mata.

Uracoa was founded in 1784 by Friar José de Manzanera. In 1799 the German geographer [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and the Frenchman [[Aimé Bonpland]] visited Caripe as part of their trip through Venezuela. Other explorers who toured the area were the Italian [[Agostino Codazzi]] (1835) and the German [[Ferdinand Bellermann]] (1843).
[[File:Provincia Cumana.jpg|thumb|Monagas as part of the province of Cumaná in 1840]]

===19th and 20th centuries===
In 1856, the Province of Maturín was created, separated from that of [[Cumaná Province|Cumaná]]. By 1864 the State of Maturín was ratified. But in 1879, Monagas was annexed to the {{Ill|Oriente (Venezuela)|lt=State of Oriente|es|Estado de Oriente}} and, from 1891 to 1898, it belonged to the {{Ill|Bermúdez (Venezuela)|lt=State of Bermúdez|es|Estado Bermúdez}}.

In 1904, Maturín became the capital of the Monagas district of Bermúdez State, whose capital was Cumaná. For a long time, Monagas was an extremely poor state. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the people of the plains and swamps north of the Orinoco, under the rule of the Caribs, made alliances with the French and Dutch as a policy of tenacious resistance against Spanish domination. On ancient maps these lands are called Caribana, kingdom of the Caribs.

In 1909 the State of Monagas was created with its current boundaries in honor of General [[José Tadeo Monagas]]. In 1924 the [[Standard Oil Company]] started oil exploration activities in the area of [[Caripito]], which experienced a slight repopulation. With the drilling of the Moneb No. 1 well in the Quiriquire field in 1928, oil exploitation began and the area experienced an important boost in urban development due to the arrival of migrant labor, particularly from the Caribbean Islands.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

In 1929 the Standard Oil Company began to build the storage yard and the deep water dock on the San Juan River and on 15 October 1930, the tanker ''Creole Bueno'' left the port of Caripito with 20,000 barrels of oil bound for Trinidad.

In 1935, the Caripito marine terminal was inaugurated, located on the San Juan River, where [[Pan American Airways]] S-42 seaplanes arrived, which included it in their Central American and Caribbean route.

In 1936 Caripito International Airport was selected by aviator [[Amelia Earhart]] and her navigator [[Fred Noonan]] as the second stopover of their trip around the world, staying overnight at the Standard Oil Company facilities. The event was widely publicized in the international press and the company provided logistical support to continue the flight through South America.

On 15 November 1940, the city of [[Punta de Mata]] was founded. On 28 December the same year, the first oil well was drilled in that area. In addition the Legislative Assembly of Monagas considered the convenience of creating the Bolivar District and integrated the municipalities of [[Punceres Municipality, Monagas|Punceres]] and Colon into its territory, designating Caripito as the capital, according to the decree of 19 January 1940, signed by Governor Jose Maria Isava on 30 January of the same year.

Under the direction of the [[Corporación Venezolana de Guayana]], several hectares of Caribbean pine were planted between Barrancas and the nearby town of Uverito, an activity that significantly boosted the development of the area. By the 1970s, it was the most important settlement{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} and port in the state of Monagas, mainly due to the lack of land road connections to the main nearby cities, such as [[Tucupita]] ([[Delta Amacuro]]) and [[Puerto Ordaz]] ([[Bolívar (state)|State of Bolivar]]), although today it continues to be an important center for the transport of goods and passengers to these cities.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}}

In 1976, the assets of Creole were [[nationalized]] and were managed by Lagoven, later by Corpoven and now by [[PDVSA]] in association with [[Repsol]]. By closing the refinery in 1976 and the oil terminal in 2002, an attempt was made to boost agricultural activity to take advantage of the fertile areas by growing cocoa, pepper, ''[[Xanthosoma]]'' ({{Lang|es|ocumo chino}} and {{Lang|es|ocumo blanco}}) and yucca.

The newspaper ''El Oriental'' was founded in 1982 in the city of Maturín. On 20 August 1983, the State Legislative Assembly declared the creation of the Municipal Council of [[Libertador Municipality, Monagas|Libertador Municipality]], in accordance with the provisions of the Law of Political Territorial Division of the State of Monagas, allowing the creation of Libertador Municipality. Since 1989, with the administrative reforms that were approved for the whole country, the state of Monagas elected for the first time, directly and secretly, its own governor and legislative assembly (called the legislative council since 2000).

In 2021, Cosme Arzolay was temporarily appointed governor.<ref name="CosmeArzolayGob">{{cite web |last1=Añez |first1=Jesimar |title=Cosme Arzolay sustituye a Yelitze Santaella en la Gobernación de Monagas |url=https://elpitazo.net/politica/cosme-arzolay-sustituye-a-yelitze-santaella-en-la-gobernacion-de-monagas/ |publisher=El Pitazo |access-date=29 August 2021 |language=es |date=24 August 2021}}</ref> In November the same year, Ernesto Luna was proclaimed governor.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Estrella|title=Proclamado Ernesto Luna nuevo Gobernador de Monagas y Ana Fuentes como alcaldesa de Maturín|date=24 November 2021 |url=https://laverdaddemonagas.com/2021/11/24/proclamado-ernesto-luna-nuevo-gobernador-de-monagas-y-ana-fuentes-como-alcaldesa-de-maturin/|access-date=2021-11-25|language=es}}</ref>

== Geography ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
[[File:Cerro Negro.jpg|right|thumb|Cerro Negro]]

===Relief===

The state has many plateaus and savannas located in the southwest. In the northeast and the southeast there are [[deltaic]] savannas in which rivers such as the [[San Juan River (Venezuela)|San Juan]], [[Guanipa River|Guanipa]], [[Caño Manamo|Caño Mánamo]], and [[Tigre River (Venezuela)|Tigre]] flow into. In the northwest is a group of mountains belonging to the eastern mountain range. This mountain range is divided into two [[massif]]s: the massif of el Turimiquire (in which the town of San Antonio is located) and the massif of Caripe (in which the town of Caripe is located).  Cerro Negro (2000 m.) is the highest mountain of Monagas State.  The mountain landscape features geological material from the [[Cretaceous]], constituted exclusively by sedimentary rocks, predominantly sandstone, shale and limestone, with the main geological formations being El Cantil, Barranquín, Guayuta and Querecual; it has elevations between {{Convert|400 and 2300|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, with valleys and depressions.

===Climate===

The weather is hot in the area of the [[Llanos]], while it is cold in the mountains located in the north of the state. The average temperature in the low areas is between {{Convert|25 and 28|C|abbr=on}}. In the area of the town of Caripe the cold temperature permits the cultivation of certain kind of typical plants from cold climates such as roses and strawberries. The level of rainfall in the state is between {{Convert|530 and 1400|mm|abbr=on}} during the year.

The region is dominated by a rainy tropical climate with some local variations that respond to various factors such as altitude, wind and proximity to the sea. Most of the state, in the southern strip, has a climate typical of savannas with dry seasons that can last up to six months, which produces a severe water shortage. The average annual temperature of Monagas is approximately {{Convert|27|C|abbr=on}}. In Maturín, Temblador and Uverito, average temperatures are between {{Convert|26 and 27|C|abbr=on}}.

===Hydrology===
[[File:Rio Morichal Largo, Estado Monagas.jpg|thumb|right|Morichal Largo river.]]
The rivers of the state belong to one of the two basins that are located in the state, the Atlantic Ocean basin and the Orinoco River basin. Rivers such as the Guanipa, Tigre, [[Morichal Largo River|Morichal Largo]], Caño Mánamo, [[Amana River|Amana]], Tonoro, Tabasca, and Uracoa flow into the Orinoco River. On the other hand, the [[Guarapiche River|Guarapiche]], San Juan, Río de Oro, and Caripe rivers flow into the Atlantic Ocean. The rivers of the Atlantic Ocean basin come from the mountains located in the northwest of the state and the rivers of the Orinoco River basin come from the many plateaus located in the southwest of Monagas State and from [[Anzoategui State]].

It has an extensive [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] network with a fairly uniform geographical distribution, with the Guarapiche River standing out in the area of the tables.{{Clarify|reason=Cuenta con una extensa red hidrográfica con una distribución geográfica bastante uniforme, destacando el río Guarapiche en el sector de las mesas.|date=September 2022}} The rivers are numerous and of little depth, marking the end of the piedmont in which three river basins with a north–south course are located: those of the rivers Amana-Areo, Guarapiche, and Púnceres-[[Aragua River|Aragua]]. From west to east the Tácata, Tonoro, Caris, Guanipa and Tigre rivers cross the state. Monagas State has a great number of moderate rivers and streams; among the main ones are:

*Guarapiche River
*Mapirito River
*Tigre River
*Morichal Largo River
*San Juan River
[[File:Nuestro Arbol Nacional.JPG|thumb|Araguaney, in Monagas, National Tree of Venezuela]]

===Vegetation===

The area's vegetation is intertropical and is adapted to the different altitudes, climates, and kinds of soil in the state. <!-- Typical trees are el araguaney, ceiba, el jobo, el aceituno, la vera, la palma de moriche and el mangle. --> The State of Monagas has an extensive biodiversity compared to other Venezuelan states. More than 2000 species of vascular flora have been catalogued within the Monagas territory.{{Citation needed|date=July 2022}} The most symbolic tree in the state is the [[moriche]] (''Mauritia flexuosa'') along the Morichal Largo River. The dominant vegetation type in the north of Monagas State is rainforest, such as that found in the mountainous area of the San Juan River valley and the municipalities of Acosta and Caripe. In these cold areas, it is possible to grow temperate plants such as strawberries and roses. However, in the flat regions, towards the south-east of the state, intertropical savanna vegetation dominates, such as thorny scrub, grasses, cujíes and other varieties that have adapted to the conditions of the state such as ''[[Ceiba]]'', {{Lang|es|jobo}}, [[Caribbean pine]], [[jabillo]] and [[carob tree]]. Another variation of the vegetation present in Monagas State can be found along the banks of the main rivers, where extensive forests of mangroves, palms and morichals have formed.

===Protected areas===
[[File:Encontrandonos.jpg|thumb|El Guácharo National Park]]
[[Cueva del Guácharo National Park]] was created in May 1975 by the Venezuelan government to protect the ecosystem surrounding the Guácharo Cave. The park has a surface area of {{cvt|155|km2}} and includes the mountainous areas of the municipalities of Acosta and Caripe in Monagas State and [[Ribero Municipality]] in [[Sucre (state)|Sucre State]].

The Alexander von Humboldt National Monument is located in the park. It was created in 1949 to protect the Guácharo Cave.{{Clarify|reason=the monument was created to protect the cave?|date=September 2022}} This national monument is named after the German explorer [[Alexander von Humboldt]], who visited the cave in 1799.

Another protected area is the Guarapiche Forestal Reserve, which protects the forests located along the banks of the Guarapiche and San Juan Rivers.

== Politics and government ==
{{See also|List of Venezuela state legislatures|List of Venezuela state constitutions|List of Venezuela governors}}

[[File:Rio cerca de las Pozas de Lorenzo.jpg|thumb|Colorado River, Caripe Municipality]]
The population of Monagas State has increased since the 1920s due to the opening of its oil fields. The majority of its inhabitants are ''[[Mestizo]];'' that is, they result from the progeny of native Indians, Black Africans and White Europeans. Many people from neighbouring states as Sucre and [[Nueva Esparta]], as well as persons from other countries as Spaniards, Italians, Portuguese, Syrian, Lebanese and Chinese have immigrated to the state because of the petroleum industry and business opportunities. The majority of the population is concentrated in the northern area of Monagas state. At least fifty percent of inhabitants live in the capital state of Maturín. The most populated cities are Maturín (514,046), Punta de Mata (69,000), Caripe (37,350), Caripito (52,000) and Temblador (36,000).

Monagas also has inhabitants of the Warao and Kariña ethnic groups.

=== Race and ethnicity ===

According to the 2011 Census, the racial composition of the population was:<ref name=Census2011>{{cite web|url=http://www.ine.gob.ve/documentos/Demografia/CensodePoblacionyVivienda/pdf/nacional.pdf|title=Resultado Básico del XIV Censo Nacional de Población y Vivienda 2011 (Mayo 2014)|page=29|publisher=Ine.gov.ve|access-date=8 September 2015}}</ref>

== Economy ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2022}}
[[File:Ganado en la carretera del Estado Monagas.jpg|thumb|right|Agriculture in Monagas.]]
The main economical activity is the exploitation of oil. Many towns such as Punta de Mata, El Tejero, and Temblador depend on this activity.

The Genarito Bull Dance is a festivity featuring several pairs of dancers, a bull, a veterinarian, a nurse, a bullfighter and musicians. The song of the Bull of Genarito is performed by Juliocesar Aguilera Simoza, a native of the town of Aguasay.

The Monkey Dance is an indigenous dance in which people hold each other by the waist, one after the other, and form lines. Guided by someone disguised as a monkey, participants walk through the streets in the manner of a human train to the Monkey Plaza. Beforehand, most of the dancers darken their faces with indigo and soot and dye their clothes with colours. They also play with water, paint, flour, [[Chilean blue crocus]] ({{Lang|es|azulillo}}) and soot in a carnival-like manner. The monkey then invites those present to join the ritual; if they do not, the monkey will give a light slap to those who refuse. It is celebrated every year on 28 December.

The Dance of the Trembler was first performed on 15 November 1989. It consists of dancing with a {{Lang|es|temblador}} (a fish, the [[electric eel]], found in the rivers closest to the town) made of cardboard and cloth. Three people go inside the {{Lang|es|temblador}} and three pairs go around it.

===Handicrafts===

==== Curagua weaving ====
The town of Aguasay is known for its weaving that is made from a plant grown in the town, called curagua.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Traditional knowledge and technologies relating to the growing and processing of the curagua - intangible heritage - Culture Sector - UNESCO |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/10b-representative-list-00779&include=slideshow.inc.php&id=01094#https://ich.unesco.org/img/photo/thumb/09686-HUG.jpg |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=[[UNESCO]]}}</ref> On 2 December 2015, Venezuelan curagua fiber and weaving was declared an [[Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity]] by [[UNESCO]] at its annual meeting in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=UNESCO - Decision of the Intergovernmental Committee: 10.COM 10.b.35 |url=https://ich.unesco.org/en/decisions |access-date=2022-09-23 |website=[[UNESCO]]}}</ref>

==== Moriche hammock ====
This art consists of carefully weaving the fiber of the moriche palm. Once it is {{Lang|es|salcochada}}{{Clarify|date=September 2022}} and spun, this fiber is tied to special sticks and woven between them, giving it the shape of a sheet; when loops are made at the ends, it takes the form of a hammock.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

====Sangrito====
The name {{Lang|es|sangrito}} is due to the fact that the raw material used for this handicraft is extracted from the roots of a tree that bears its name because when it is cut, its roots tend to bleed; it is easy to mould as it is a very soft and light wood. The Warao Indians use this material to mold figures of animals that live in the forests and rivers that they frequent.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

[[File:Torre Espacial Lumino-Cromática.jpg|thumb|Lumino-Chromatic Space Tower]]

====Warao craftsmanship====
Produced by the Warao Indians, according to the use given to the object, without being separated from the work element. The raw material is plant fibers, mostly moriche and {{Lang|es|sangrito}} wood, with which they carve figures and animals, as well as making necklaces with peonies, ''[[Mucuna]]'' seeds and [[Job's tears]], among other materials. In addition, they construct harpoons, buoys, shields, arrows, candles, roofs, ropes, pitchforks and bridges. The craftsmanship of the Warao reflects their organizational idiosyncrasy, as well as their world: nature, spirit, man.
