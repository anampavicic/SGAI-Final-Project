'''Tepexpan''' is the largest town in the [[Acolman]] [[municipalities of Mexico|municipality]] in the [[State of Mexico]], [[Mexico]]. The population was 48,103 as of the 2005 Mexican census. 

One of the most interesting aspects of this town is the discovery of an early Mesoamerican skeleton commonly referred to as "[[Tepexpan man]]". Recent research tries to show that the skeleton was not that of a man but that of a woman. The woman was apparently trampled by a raging mastodon around 11,000 BCE. The proposition that Tepexpan Man was a woman has been advanced by one Mexican archaeologist based on DNA analysis. His peers at INAH have not accepted his conclusions and he has not submitted his analysis in a paper for peer review. Thus, until peer review confirms his work one must leave the matter as conjecture. Additional mammoth fossils from the Late Pleistocene show this site the nearby [[Santa Isabel Ixtapan]]to be mammoth kill sites. Mammoths were driven into bogs where they were severely slowed and eventually killed with fluted points as early as 9000 BCE or as late as 7000 BCE. <ref>Ancient Mexico and Central America</ref>  

Tepexpan can be considered one of the most important towns in the municipal region of [[Acolman]].  It has many resources, among these: obsidian and pewter.
