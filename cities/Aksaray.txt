The city of Aksaray has a long history and was an important stopover point on the [[Silk Road]] that transited [[Anatolia]] for centuries. It is a mid-sized city with the [[Melendiz River|Melendiz river]] running through it and several monuments dating back to the pre-Ottoman era as well as some impressive examples of government buildings from the early Turkish Republic that are gathered around the main square.

The nearest airport is [[Nevşehir Kapadokya Airport|Kapadokya Nevşehir Airport]] (NAV) which is 62.1&nbsp;km away from the city.

==Etymology==
In antiquity the area was named ''Archelais Garsaura'', which was mutated to ''Taksara'' during the [[Seljuk Turk]]ish era, and then to ''Aksaray''. ''Aksaray'' means "White Palace" in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

==History==


===Hittite period===
First mentioned as '''Šinaḫuttum-Šinuhtu''' in ancient [[Hittites|Hittite]] texts, and later '''Nenaşşa''', (also spelled as '''Nenessa''' and ''Nenossós'' in [[Ancient Greek]] texts) and '''Kurşaura'''.

===Iron Age===
====Šinuḫtu Kingdom====
[[File:Stele Aksaray02.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Aksaray Stele|Aksaray stele]], a [[Syro-Hittite states|Syro-Hittite]] stele in [[Aksaray Museum]].]]

The [[Aksaray Stele|Aksaray Stela]] was written in Luwian Hieroglyphs and was dedicated by king '''Kiyakiyas '''who described his prosperity in his reign and the benevolence of the weather god [[Tarḫunz|Tarhunzas]]. Kiyakiyas may be identical with king '''Kiyakki of Šinuḫtu''', who ruled prior to 718 BC. At that time [[Šinuḫtu]] was taken, the king was seized and deported by the Neo-Assyrian king [[Sargon II]].

The Hittite name '''Kurşaura '''underwent a sound change to '''Garsaura'''. The /k/ became voiced and turned into a /g/ consonant, while the /u/ became /a/.<ref>[https://aksaray.ktb.gov.tr/TR-243539/antik-cagda-kursauradan-garsauraya.html]https://aksaray.ktb.gov.tr/TR-243539/antik-cagda-kursauradan-garsauraya.html</ref> Strabon mentions Garsaura in his work (V/4 and VI/1).

===Classical period===
The town of '''Garsaura''' was renamed '''Archelaïs''' ({{langx|el|{{lang|grc|Ἀρχελαΐς}}}})  by [[Archelaus of Cappadocia]], the last Cappadocian king. In [[Roman Empire|Roman]] times, the town was known as '''Colonia''' and became a bishropric.

Of its bishops, Euphrasius was at the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325; Bosporus (who is mentioned in the correspondence of [[Basil the Great]] and [[Gregory of Nazianzus]]) at the [[First Council of Constantinople]] in 381; Daniel at the [[Council of Ephesus]] in 431; Aristomachus (who was also a signatory of the letter of the bishops of the [[Roman province]] of [[Cappadocia Tertia]], to which Colonia belonged, to [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Leo I the Thracian]] about the killing of [[Proterius of Alexandria]] in 458) at the [[Council of Chalcedon]] in 451; Alexander at a [[Council of Constantinople (536)|council in Constantinople]] called by [[Patriarch Menas of Constantinople]] in 536; and Conon at the [[Trullan Council]] of 692.<ref>Michel Lequien, [https://books.google.com/books?id=0agp0mJFG_sC ''Oriens christianus in quatuor Patriarchatus digestus''], Paris 1740, Vol. I, coll. 413-416</ref><ref>Raymond Janin, v.

===Middle Ages===
[[File:Kısıl Kilise (Sivrihisar) 01.jpg|thumb|[[Kizil Kilise]] (“[[Kizil Kilise|Red Church]]”), formerly known as [[Saint Spyridon|St. Spyridon]] Church near [[Güzelyurt]].]]
During Byzantine times, the town was known as '''Koloneia''' (Κολώνεια) was an important military center, holding an imperial ''[[aplekton]]''.{{sfn|Beihammer|2017|p=228}}

At some point between 1081 and 1084, the town was part of the domain of [[Suleiman ibn Qutalmish]] according to [[Ibn al-Athir|Ibn al-Athīr]].{{sfn|Beihammer|2017|p=228}} This would later become the [[Sultanate of Rum]] and the Sultans founded and left important landmarks in and around the town. Its name also changed over time to '''Taksará''' and Aksará, which is a rendering of Garsáoura.  The Moroccan traveller [[Ibn Battuta]]. who visited the region in the 14th century, was impressed by the class of Muslim traders that had emerged in Aksaray and noted the urban centre as "a beautiful city, surrounded by waterways and gardens, with a water supply coming right to the houses of the city."

===Ottoman Empire===
[[File:Aksaray_Ulu_Cami_3109.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Aksaray Grand Mosque]] in Aksaray city centre, built during the reign of the Karamanids.]]
In 1470 Aksaray was incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]] by [[İshak Pasha]] after a protracted struggle against the [[Karamanids]]. Many inhabitants of the city were relocated to [[Constantinople]] (recently captured by the Ottomans) where they were settled in a part of the city that also came to be named [[Aksaray (Istanbul)|Aksaray]].

During Ottoman times, the town was prosperous in part because of its proximity to Tuz Gölü ([[Lake Tuz]]), which was a primary source of salt for Anatolia.<ref>Swan, Suzanne (2012) [1st pub. 2003], ''Eyewitness Travel Turkey'', London, UK: Dorling Kindersley Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-40536-888-9}}</ref>

==== Caravanserais ====
[[File:Sultanhanı_Kervansaray._Sultanhanı.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Monumental entrance of the [[Sultan Han]]]]
Several monumental [[caravanserai]]s straddle the trade route linking [[Konya]] to Aksaray that once continued to [[Iran|Persia]] (the ''Uzun Yolu''). The best known and most impressive is [[Sultan Han]], located in [[Sultanhanı|Sultanhan]] village about {{convert|40|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} west of Aksaray. A date on this fortified structure indicates that it was built in 1229, during the reign of the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] Sultan [[Kayqubad I]], by the Syrian architect Mohammed Bin Havlan El Dimaski (the word Dimasci indicating [[Damascus]]) . After it was partially destroyed by a fire, it was restored and extended in 1278 by the governor Seraceddin Ahmed Kerimeddin bin El Hasan during the reign of Sultan [[Kaykhusraw III]]. It was then the largest caravanserai in Turkey. Today, it is one of the best surviving examples of [[Anatolian Seljuk architecture]].<ref name=branning>{{Cite web |last=Branning |first=Katherine |title= Sultan Han Aksaray |url=http://www.turkishhan.org/sultanaksaray.htm}}</ref>

The monumental entrance to the han is on the east side and is a 13m-high marble portal (''[[pishtaq]]'') projecting from the 50m wide front wall. The gate is enclosed by a pointed arch decorated with [[muqarnas]] and elegant geometric patterns. The open courtyard (44 x 58 m) was lined with arcades with stables beneath the accommodation. Outdoor areas were used in the summer, while the covered rooms (''iwans'') on either side were used during the winter. In the middle of the courtyard stands a square stone kiosk-mosque (''kösk mesçidi''), the oldest example in Turkey. The mosque on the second floor sits on a construction of four carved barrel-vaulted arches.<ref name=branning/>

At the other side of the courtyard is another equally decorative arched entrance with muqarnas, [[joggled (architecture)|joggled]] [[voussoir]]s and interlocking geometric designs. It leads into a stable covered with a barrel vault with transverse ribs. A short tower, capped by a dome, stands over the crossing area. This dome has an [[Oculus (architecture)|oculus]], providing light and air to the stable.<ref name=branning/>

== Aksaray Museum ==
{{main|Aksaray Museum}}
[[File:Aksaray Museum02.jpg|thumb|[[Aksaray Museum]].]]
Aksaray Museum exhibits the [[Aksaray Stele]], a Late Hittite monument discovered in  the city in 1976. The stone block is 88&nbsp;cm high, and 90&nbsp;cm wide but the top half is missing. It portrays a weather god, facing right and wearing pointed shoes. On the reverse are the last five lines of a text in [[Luwian hieroglyphs]] including a dedication by King Kiyakiya who describes the prosperity of his reign and the benevolence of the weather god [[Tarhunzas]]. Kiyakiya is believed to be the same as King Kiakki of [[Šinuḫtu]], who is mentioned in Assyrian texts and ruled in 718 BC. He was then deported by the Neo-Assyrian king [[Sargon II]]. He is also mentioned in the [[Topada rock inscription]] ([[:de:Felsinschrift von Topada]]) as one of the kings who were allied with [[Wasusarma]] of [[Tabal (state)|Tabal]].

== Aksaray Castle ==
[[File:Two-panel Aksaray kilim, ex-VOK collection, 18th century (52200534532).jpg|thumb|350px|Aksaray [[kilim]], 18th century. Likely made by settled Hotamis Turkmen in the Aksaray region. Size 185 x 100 cm.]]
the Aksaray Castle was a four-cornered, stone-built, solidly built castle on a large area, on the edge of the [[Melendiz River|Melendiz river]]. It was built in the middle of the city. The bastion and its towers were not very high. With all their bastions, teeth and bodies, their crenellated holes and their calculated towers always faced each other. During the siege, the strong warriors of each tower guarded the towers with rifles. There were five gates on the side of the fortresses. Küçükkapı faces west. Demirkapı (Sídero Porta) opens to the qibla. Keçikapısı (Gida Porta) also opens towards the qibla. Ereğlikapısı (Herakleia Porta) opens to the south and Konyakapısı (Ikónion Porta) opens to the west. The guards of these gates are the tax collectors. A warehouse was built in the castle to store wheat during the rebels' time. It has no arsenal. There were big balls thrown during Ramadan and other festivals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://dergipark.org.tr/tr/download/article-file/392971|title=AKSARAY KALESİ - The Citadel of Aksaray|access-date=2021-10-13|author=Bekir DENİZ|language=tr}}</ref>

The southern interior of the castle is now where Aksaray Square stands. The Kurşunlu Mosque is where Ereğlikapısı used to be. It also encompasses the [[Aksaray Grand Mosque]] to the North-East of where the castle once stood. The Zinciriye Medresesi lies at the West entrance of the castle. The existence of the castle dates back to the first ages but was also very prominent during the [[Middle Ages]]. The castle existed in [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] times.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://e-sehir.aksaray.edu.tr/2021/01/13/aksaray-kalesi/|title=Encyclopedia about Aksaray Castle|access-date=2021-10-13|author=Aksaray e-Ansiklopedi|language=tr}}</ref>

== Economy ==
[[File:NoraCity.jpg|270px|thumb|[[Nora (Cappadocia)|Nora]] City AVM is a shopping centre in the city of Aksaray]]
Seventy percent of the local workforce is engaged in  [[Agriculture in Turkey|agriculture]] and animal husbandry. Barley, sugar beet, vetch, corn, potatoes, onions, beans, flax, hemp, grapes and apples are the main local crops, with wheat production being most dominant. Carpet and rug weaving were traditionally important, especially in the area around Sultanhanı but these days the weavers mainly focus on repairing and repurposing old carpets.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Historic carpets gains a new face in Turkish town |url=https://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/historic-carpets-gains-a-new-face-in-turkish-town-23368 |access-date=2022-09-28 |website=Hürriyet Daily News |language=en}}</ref> There is also some industry in Aksaray city.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Aksaray Belediyesi|url=http://www.aksaray.bel.tr/ekonomik-durumu-124|access-date=2021-05-18|website=www.aksaray.bel.tr}}</ref>

[[Ihlara Valley]] and the other tourist attractions of [[Cappadocia]] may be nearby but Aksaray has not had much success in attracting visitors to the city itself.

==Climate==
Aksaray has a [[cold semi-arid climate]] (BSk) under the [[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] classification and a hot-summer [[continental climate]] (Dca) under the [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]] classification.
