'''Muntinlupa''' ({{IPA|tl|mʊntɪnˈlupɐ|lang}}), officially the '''City of Muntinlupa''' ({{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Muntinlupa}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]] of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 543,445 people.{{PH census|current}}

It is bordered on the north by [[Taguig]], to the northwest by [[Parañaque]], by [[Bacoor]] and [[Las Piñas]] to the west, to the southwest by [[Dasmariñas]], by [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]] to the south, and by [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country, to the east. From high above, the city of Muntinlupa has many large, green patches, which is unusual for Metro Manila.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |last=Bunye |first=Ignacio R. |date=December 23-26, 2016 |title=Speaking Out: Nearing nearing the century mark |pages=37 |work=Filipino Reporters}}</ref> Because of these green patches, Muntinlupa earned the name "Emerald City"<ref name=":0" /> by the tourism establishment<ref>{{cite web|title=Muntinlupa City|url=http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php?title=MuntinlupaCity&func=all&pid=502|publisher=Department of Tourism|access-date=December 19, 2012|archive-date=January 27, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127010101/http://www.visitmyphilippines.com/index.php?title=MuntinlupaCity&func=all&pid=502|url-status=dead}}</ref> and also known as the "Gateway to [[Calabarzon]]" as it is the southernmost city of the [[Metro Manila|National Capital Region]].

Muntinlupa is known as the location of the national insular [[prison|penitentiary]], the [[New Bilibid Prison]], where the country's most dangerous criminals are incarcerated. This was relocated from its [[Manila City Jail|old site]] in [[Santa Cruz, Manila|Santa Cruz]], [[Manila]].<ref name=":0" /> Before the relocation of [[New Bilibid Prison]] to Muntinlupa in the 1930s, Muntinlupa was mainly dedicated to fishing and farming.<ref name=":0" />  

[[Ayala Alabang Village]], one of the country's biggest and most expensive residential communities, where many of the wealthy and famous live, is also located in Muntinlupa.

==Etymology==
There are three plausible origins of the name of the city:

# Its association with the thin topsoil in the area, known locally as ''munting lupa'', or "little soil" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]];
# Residents, purportedly answering a question from Spaniards in the 16th century of what the name of their place was, saying "''Monte sa Lupa''", apparently mistaking the question for what card game they were playing; and 
# The topographical nature of the area, in which case the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] term ''monte'', or "mountain", was expanded to ''muntinlupa'', or "mountain land".<ref name="Travelgrove">{{cite web|url=http://www.travelgrove.com/travel-guides/Philippines/Muntinlupa-History-c1497390.html|title=Muntinlupa History, Philippines|author=<!--Not stated-->|date=<!--Not stated-->|website=Travelgrove|publisher=Travelgrove, Inc.|access-date=May 30, 2023|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210927033346/http://www.travelgrove.com/travel-guides/Philippines/Muntinlupa-History-c1497390.html|archive-date=September 27, 2021}}</ref> 

The 1987 Philippine Constitution spells the city's name as "Muntinglupa" instead of "Muntinlupa".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/constitutions/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines/the-1987-constitution-of-the-republic-of-the-philippines-ordinance/|title=THE 1987 CONSTITUTION OF THE REPUBLIC OF THE PHILIPPINES – ORDINANCE &#124; GOVPH|website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]}}</ref>

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===
In 1601, some 88 years after the arrival of [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] navigator [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in the Visayas islands, the original lands constituting Muntinlupa could be deduced to have been friar lands administered by the Augustinians, then sold and assigned to the Sanctuary of Guadalupe.

In the early 1800s, Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga, an Agustinian Friar, in his Two Volume Book: "Estadismo de las islas Filipinas", described Muntinlupa as a lakeside town composed of 250 tributes (each tribute representing a family of 5 to 7), and was the farthest town of the province of [[Tondo, Manila|Tondo]], itself composed of 14,437 native tributes and 3,528 Spanish Filipino tributes. Spiritually, it also belonged to the nearby Parish of [[Nuestra Señora de Gracia Church|Our Lady of Guadalupe at Makati]] and was connected to it via many rivers that streamed from [[Laguna de Bay]] through Muntinlupa towards [[Makati]] and eventually [[Manila]] proper.<ref name="Estadismo1">{{Cite web |url=http://www.xeniaeditrice.it/zu%C3%B1igaIocrpdf.pdf |title=ESTADISMO DE LAS ISLAS FILIPINAS TOMO PRIMERO By Joaquín Martínez de Zúñiga (Original Spanish) |access-date=February 3, 2024 |archive-date=March 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309030040/http://www.xeniaeditrice.it/zu%C3%B1igaIocrpdf.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref>{{rp|26}} 

In 1869, the lands were transferred to the state and large individual landholders. In an effort by the Spanish Government to bring under closer administrative control the people living in the contiguous sitios, as well as those in Alabang, Tunasan, Sucat, and Cupang, the municipality was created upon the recommendation of Don Eduardo de Canizares.

On August 6, 1898, the town supported the Philippine Revolution against the Spaniards and formally joined the revolutionary government headed by Gen. [[Emilio Aguinaldo]].

===American occupation era===
The Philippine Commission promulgated [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] Province on June 11, 1901, through Act No. 137. Muntinlupa became part of the new province after being a part of the defunct [[Manila (province)|province of Manila]].

On October 12, 1903, Muntinlupa, alongside [[Taguig]], was merged with [[Pateros]] by virtue of Act No. 942.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=Act|number=942|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l89ad|date=October 12, 1903|accessdate=April 24, 2022|title=An Act Reducing the Thirty-Two Municipalities of the Province of Rizal to Fifteen|website=Lawyerly}}</ref> On November 25, 1903, Muntinlupa was incorporated under Act No. 1008 and included within the boundary of the province of [[Laguna (province)|La Laguna]] under the municipality of [[Biñan]].<ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getdoc&DocId=622&Index=%2A9b8c493322d6ea4e01a8b64cca8b398a|chamber=Act|number=1008|title=An Act Amending Act Numbered Nine hundred and thirty-nine, entitled "An Act reducing the thirty municipalities of the Province of La Laguna to nineteen," and Act Numbered Nine hundred and forty-two, entitled "An Act reducing the thirty - two municipalities of the Province of Rizal to fifteen," and providing that the boundary line between the Provinces of La Laguna and Rizal be changed so as to include in La Laguna the municipality of Muntinlupa now a part of Rizal.|date= November 25, 1903|accessdate=April 24, 2022|website=Supreme Court E-Library}}</ref> Muntinlupa residents protested this Executive Act, and through their town head, Marcelo Fresnedi, filed a formal petition to the Governor for the return of the municipality to the province of Rizal. On March 22, 1905, Act No. 1308 paved the way for Muntinlupa's return to the province of Rizal to then become a part of [[Taguig]], along with [[Pateros]].<ref name="history_munti" /><ref>{{cite PH act|url=https://lawyerly.ph/laws/view/l43ec|chamber=Act|number=1308|date=March 22, 1905|accessdate=April 24, 2022|title=An Act providing for the return of the former municipality of Muntinlupa from the Province of La Laguna to the Province of Rizal, repealing paragraph (e) of section one and sections two and three of Act Numbered One thousand and eight, and changing the name of the municipality of Pateros, of the Province of Rizal, to Taguig|website=Lawyerly}}</ref>

On December 19, 1917, Governor-General [[Francis Burton Harrison]] signed Executive Order 108, which made Muntinlupa an independent municipality, separating it from Taguig. The law took effect on January 1, 1918.<ref name="history_munti">{{cite news|url=https://muntinlupacity.gov.ph/history/|title=History|website=City Government of Muntinlupa|accessdate=April 15, 2023}}</ref> Vidal Joaquin, a native of [[Alabang]], served as the first appointed mayor from 1918 to 1919, followed by Primo Ticman, native of [[Poblacion, Muntinlupa|Poblacion]], from 1919 to 1922. Melencio Espeleta became the first elected mayor of Muntinlupa in 1922, serving until 1924.

===Japanese occupation era===
[[File:Philippine Island - Luzon Island - NARA - 68156983.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Muntinlupa with New Bilibid Prison, 1941]]
On January 22, 1941, the historic [[New Bilibid Prison]], the national penitentiary, was established in the hills of Muntinlupa. During World War II, the [[New Bilibid Prison]] was used to lock up Filipino political prisoners by the Japanese occupation authorities, but they were set free by [[Hunters ROTC]] guerrillas.<ref name=":0" />

===Philippine independence===
On November 7, 1975, Muntinlupa was transferred from the Province of [[Rizal (province)|Rizal]] to the newly formed [[Metro Manila|Metropolitan Manila]] by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824 issued by then-President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].<ref name="PD824">{{cite PH act|chamber=PD|number=824|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_824_1975.html|title=Creating the Metropolitan Manila and the Metropolitan Manila Commission and for Other Purposes |date=November 7, 1975 |access-date=July 10, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160312121648/http://lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1975/pd_824_1975.html|archive-date=March 12, 2016|url-status=live|website=Lawphil}}</ref>

In the ratification of the [[1987 Constitution]], Muntinlupa together with [[Las Piñas]] formed one political district.

On January 31, 1988, protesters of the [[1988 Philippine local elections|1988 Muntinlupa election]] results who barricaded in front of the Muntinlupa town hall the past two days began storming the premises, with supporters of the two leading mayoral candidates confronting each other and causing injury to former mayor Santiago Carlos Jr. and barangay official Florante Torres among others.<ref>{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Radito|title=Protesters storm M'lupa town hall|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l5AtAAAAIBAJ|access-date=May 11, 2024|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Standard Publications, Inc.|date=February 2, 1988|pages=1–2}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Radito|title=Bunye named Munti winner|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mJAtAAAAIBAJ|access-date=May 11, 2024|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Standard Publications, Inc.|date=February 3, 1988|pages=1–2|quote=The move followed a violent dispersal of protesters manning a barricade in front of the municipal building last Sunday [January 31].}}</ref> By February 17, a grenade that failed to explode was found to have been thrown onto the roof of mayor-elect Bunye's house in Alabang.<ref>{{cite news|last=Torres|first=Radito|title=Makati building bombed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pZAtAAAAIBAJ&pg=PA2|access-date=May 11, 2024|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Standard Publications, Inc.|date=February 18, 1988|pages=2}}</ref> On December 6, 1988, President [[Corazón Aquino|Corazon C.

===Topography===
[[File:Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay ESA374973.jpg|thumb|Photo of Muntinlupa along Laguna de Bay and nearby cities captured by the Copernicus Sentinel-2A satellite on May 8, 2016]]
It is bordered on the north by [[Taguig]], to the northwest by [[Parañaque]], to the west by [[Las Piñas]], to the southwest by the cities of [[Bacoor]] and [[Dasmariñas]] in [[Cavite]], to the south by the city of [[San Pedro, Laguna|San Pedro]] in [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], and to the east by [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the country.

Muntinlupa's terrain is relatively flat to sloping towards the east along the lake. Gentle rolling hills occupy the western part of the city, with elevation increasing up to {{convert|60|m|sp=us}} and above towards its southwest portion.

While a majority of the land area in the city is highly urbanized, the New Bilibid Prison (NBP) Reservation in barangay Poblacion is relatively free of urbanization, although there are ongoing discussions to move the national penitentiary to [[Nueva Ecija]] and [[Occidental Mindoro]], respectively.<ref>{{cite news|work=BusinessWorld|url=https://www.bworldonline.com/doj-pressed-on-bilibid-prison-transfer-to-nueva-ecija/|date=11 Dec 2018|title=DoJ pressed on Bilibid prison transfer to Nueva Ecija|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210924004802/https://www.bworldonline.com/doj-pressed-on-bilibid-prison-transfer-to-nueva-ecija/|archive-date=24 Sep 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/doj-remulla-wants-relocate-new-bilibid-prison-occidental-mindoro/|title=DOJ chief Remulla wants to relocate Bilibid to Occidental Mindoro|first=Jairo|last=Boledo|date=August 18, 2022|accessdate=January 1, 2023|work=Rappler}}</ref>

====Etymology of barangays====
The barangays of the city are named after the botanical characteristics, topographical features, and historical events that had been observed in the area when it was named. Tunasan from the plant [[Opuntia|tunas]]. Putatan got its name from a tree called [[putat]]. Cupang is likewise named after the [[Parkia javanica|cupang tree]]. Buli is named after the [[buri palm]]. Alabang is named after the river that passes through the barangay. Ayala Alabang was created by Batas Pambansa Bilang 219 out of Barangay Alabang. Sucat got its name from the vernacular word "sukat", which means "measurement" since it was measured during the Spanish era.

===Subdivisions===
While [[barangay]]s are the administrative divisions of the city and are legally part of the addresses of homes and establishments, many residents identify themselves by their [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] (village) instead of their barangay.

===Territorial dispute and discrepancies===
Muntinlupa is involved in a boundary dispute with [[Parañaque]], centered on Sitio Bagong Silang, which is claimed by Sucat and contested by Parañaque's barangay [[BF Homes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.manilatimes.net/2023/08/19/news/national/muntinlupa-paraaque-in-land-dispute-too/1906054|title=Muntinlupa, Parañaque in land dispute, too|first=Francis Earl|last=Cueto|date=August 19, 2023|accessdate=August 19, 2023|work=The Manila Times}}</ref> Additionally, Sitio Pagkakaisa in barangay [[San Martin de Porres, Parañaque]] is mistakenly regarded as part of Sucat. <!-- see Openstreetmap and Google Maps -->
