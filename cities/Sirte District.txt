The boundaries of Sirte district have changed several times, most recently in the [[Districts of Libya#Shabiya|2007 administrative reorganization]] of Libyan districts (see maps). From 1983 to 1987 the [[Bin Jawad District]] covered parts of what is now part of Sirte District. To the north, Sirte District has a shoreline on the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. As of 2007, on land, it bordered the following districts, namely, [[Al Wahat District|Al Wahat]] in the east, [[Jufra District|Jufra]] in the south, [[Jabal al Gharbi District|Jabal al Gharbi]] in the west and [[Misrata District|Misrata]] in the northwest. Sirte is an interim destination of a [[Rail transport in Libya|coastal railway]] from [[Transport in Tunisia#Railways|Tunisia]] to [[Benghazi]] that began construction in 2007. Sirte is a part of Triplotania geographical region of Libya that runs from north to south and has set of coastal oases, plains and limestone plateaus having an elevation of {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}.
