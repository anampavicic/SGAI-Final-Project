{{nihongo|'''Beppu'''|別府市|Beppu-shi}} is a city in [[Ōita Prefecture]] on the island of [[Kyushu]], [[Japan]]. As of November 30, 2023, the city had a population of 113,045 in 62,702 households, and a population density of 900 persons per km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Beppu-hp">{{cite web |url=https://www.city.beppu.oita.jp/sisei/sinogaiyou/detail11.htmll|title= Beppu City official statistics|location= Japan|language= ja}}</ref> The total area of the city is {{cvt|125.34|km2}}.

==Geography==
Beppu is situated at the west end of [[Beppu Bay]], around the east central prefecture. Adjacent municipalities include [[Ōita, Ōita |Ōita]] (the prefectural capital), [[Usa, Ōita |Usa]], [[Yufu, Ōita |Yufu]], and [[Hiji, Ōita |Hiji]].

The east area of the city consists of an [[alluvial fan]] as well as [[alluvial plain]], made with rivers flowing into Beppu Bay, namely Asami River, Haruki River and Sakai River. The main urban area of Beppu has been formed within this relatively narrow land which spans approximately 5&nbsp;km from east to west and 10&nbsp;km from north to south.

The west area of the city includes a number of scenic locations such as Yufugawa Canyon, which has been selected as one of '''One Hundred View of Oita''', and/or some designated areas of [[Aso Kujū National Park]], with a large amount of forests.

Around the city are mountains or highlands with elevations of several hundreds meters above sea level. Most of those mountains are [[Quaternary]] volcanos. Particularly, locations such as [[Mount Tsurumi]] is relatively new, and fumarolic activities are observed. Besides Mount Tsurumi, [[Mount Yufu]], Mount Ohira and others shape a range of mountains.

There are a large number of seismic faults on the north and south of the alluvial fan, surrounding the urban area (giving rise to a large number of thermal vents). Given the short distance from the sea shore on the east coast to the west part of the city with altitude of several hundreds meters or higher, the city has many slopes mainly on the east-west direction.

===Climate===
Beppu has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (Köppen ''Cfa'') characterized by warm summers and cool winters with light to no snowfall. The average annual temperature in Beppu is 15.2&nbsp;°C. The average annual rainfall is 1663&nbsp;mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 26.2&nbsp;°C, and lowest in January, at around 4.3&nbsp;°C.<ref>[https://en.climate-data.org/asia/japan/oita/beppu-714805/  Beppu climate: Average Temperature, weather by month]</ref>

==History==
The area of Beppu was part of ancient [[Bungo Province]]. During the [[Kamakura period]], due to its onsens, it began to be used as a health resort for wounded samurai.<ref name=":0" />

Beppu Port (later Kunisaki Port) was opened on May 30, 1871, with connections to [[Osaka]] and other ports on the [[Seto Inland Sea]]. It was the main logistics hub for the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] during the [[Satsuma Rebellion]] of 1877. Hot spring development as a tourist destination began in earnest from 1879 with the opening of Takegawara Onsen. In 1885, a ferry service to [[Uwajima, Ehime|Uwajima]] in Shikoku commenced. The village of Beppu was established on May 1, 1889 with the creation of the modern municipalities system and was raised to town status on April 11, 1893. 

Beppu and Hamawaki Town merged on April 1, 1906 (with a total population of 12,306). [[Beppu Station]] opened on July 16, 1911 and on July 15, 1923, a regular seaplane route to Osaka was opened. It was raised to city status on April 1, 1924 (total population 32,276). In 1945, after the Allied Occupation, ''Camp Chicamauga'' (present day Beppu Park) was established as the regional headquarters.<ref>{{Citation |last=Porter |first=Edgar A. |title=19.

==Local attractions==
The economy of Beppu is strongly influenced by tourism to its many hot spring resorts.

===Hot springs===
Beppu is famous for its ''[[onsen]]'' (Japanese style [[hot springs]]). It has eight major [[geothermal gradient|geothermal]] [[Hotspot (geology)|hot spots]]  known as {{nihongo||別府八湯|Beppu Hattō}}.<ref name="Hatto">{{cite web |title=Beppu Hatto Information |url=https://www.city.beppu.oita.jp/seikatu/gaikokujinmuke/ei/detail2.html |website=Beppu City Official Website |access-date=12 June 2024}}</ref><ref>[http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e4702.html Hells (Jigoku)], Japan-guide.com Retrieved May 20, 2013.</ref> The eight major hot spring areas are [[Beppu Onsen]], [[Kankaiji Onsen|Kankaiji]], [[Beppu Onsen#Kamegawa Onsen|Kamegawa]], [[Beppu Onsen#Shibaseki Onsen|Shibaseki]], [[Beppu Onsen#Kannawa Onsen|Kannawa]], [[Beppu Onsen#Myoban Onsen|Myoban]], [[Beppu Onsen#Horita Onsen|Horita]], and [[Beppu Onsen#Hamawaki Onsen|Hamawaki]]. 

There are over 150 individual ''onsen'' facilities for bathing in Beppu.<ref name="stamps" /> There is an ''onsen'' [[stamp rally]] where individuals receive a stamp for each ''onsen'' they visit. If an individual receives 88 stamps, they are considered to be an "''onsen'' expert" (温泉名人, ''onsen meijin'').<ref name="stamps">{{cite web |title=別府八湯温泉道とは？温泉愛が試されるスタンプラリーで目指せ”温泉名人”！ |url=https://yuagari-honpo.jp/blog/2130/ |website=Yuagari-Honpo |access-date=13 June 2024}}</ref>
Notable ''onsen'' bathing facilities in Beppu include [[Takegawara Onsen]], [[Myoban Yunosato Onsen]], and [[Hyotan Onsen]].
