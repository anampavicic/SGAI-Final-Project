Its capital and largest city is [[Medan]] on the east coast of the island. It is bordered by Aceh on the northwest and [[Riau]] and [[West Sumatra]] on the southeast, by coastlines located on the [[Indian Ocean]] to the west, and by the [[Strait of Malacca]] (with a maritime border with [[Malaysia]]) to the east.

At {{convert|72,460.74|km2|mi2}}, North Sumatra is also the third-largest province in area on the island of Sumatra behind [[South Sumatra]] and [[Riau]]. Major ethnic groups include the [[Malay Indonesian|Malay]], native to the east coast; several [[Batak]] groups, indigenous to the west coast and central highlands; the [[Nias people]] of [[Nias|Nias Island]] and its surrounding islets; and [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], [[Javanese people|Javanese]], and [[Indian Indonesians|Indian]] peoples, who first migrated to Sumatra during [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch rule]].

North Sumatra is home to the '''Toba [[Supervolcano]]''', located in what is now [[Lake Toba]], which [[Youngest Toba eruption|erupted 74,000–75,000 years ago]], wiping out nearly all of humanity. The supereruption resulted in the creation of Lake Toba and was rated a VEI-8 eruption.

During Dutch rule, North Sumatra was administered under the ''[[Administrative divisions of the Dutch East Indies#Sumatra|Gouvernement van Sumatra]],'' which governed the entire island of Sumatra out of Medan. In 1948, after Indonesian independence was proclaimed, Sumatra Province was divided into three sub-provinces, each of which had the right to regulate and manage its own affairs. April 15, 1948 was later designated as the anniversary of the Province of North Sumatra.

In the second wave of migration from mainland Southeast Asia {{circa|1000 BC}}, the [[Malay people|Young Malays]] or Deutero Malays settled on the coast. They mainly lived by fishing and by cultivating the marshy land for agriculture. Their villages were scattered along the big rivers that flow to the east coast of North Sumatra such as Besitang, [[Wampu River|Wampu]], [[Asahan River|Asahan]], and [[Barumun River|Barumun]]. Larger villages grew at the mouths of rivers and became centres of government.

The eastern coastal area of North Sumatra, located on the shores of the Straits of Malacca, has been widely visited by Hindus and by Chinese traders for centuries since the founding of early ''Situs Kota Cina'' or Chinatown sites in [[Hamparan Perak]] {{circa|11th–14th centuries CE}}. [[Barus]], a trading port on the western coast of Tapanuli, attracted [[Middle Ages|Middle Age]] era traders in search of [[camphor]], which was popular in Ancient Egypt. In 1030, [[Rajendra Chola]] recorded the names of North Sumatran states he defeated in one expedition to conquer [[Srivijaya]]. States that he mentioned included Sriwijaya, Malayur, Kendara, and the [[Panai Kingdom]]. Furthermore, the [[Negarakertagama]] epic by [[Mpu Prapanca]] from the 14th century list countries found in North Sumatra, Pane, Haru, Mandailing, Tamiang, Lawas, and Barus, which were mainly defeated by the [[Majapahit]].

By {{circa|1500}}, there were several kingdoms on the east coast of Sumatra, namely the larger Nagur and [[Aru Kingdom|Aru]] kingdoms and the smaller [[Pannai|Panai]] and Batangiou kingdoms. To the west, in the hinterland of [[Central Tapanuli Regency|Tapanuli]], another kingdom emerged: a Batak kingdom founded by descendants of Sisingamangaraja. This kingdom gradually expanded its influenced throughout Tapanuli to Angkola, Mandailing, and Dairi. The three largest kingdoms in North Sumatra in the sixteenth century were Nagur, the Batak kingdom under the rule of King Sisingamangaraja, and Aru. 

Wars between these three kingdoms made the region vulnerable to outside influences from [[Aceh Sultanate|Aceh]], [[Melaka Sultanate|Melaka]], [[Portuguese discoveries|Portugal]], [[Siak Sultanate|Siak]], and [[Pagaruyung Kingdom|Minangkabau]]. The Sultanate of Aceh worked to [[Islamization|spread Islam]] across the eastern coast, and in the [[Padri War]], succeeded in spreading Islam into the southern Tapanuli kingdom. As a result of this warfare and cultural shifts, the three big kingdoms split into several small kingdoms and sultanates, including [[Deli Sultanate|Deli]], [[Serdang Sultanate|Serdang]], [[Asahan Sultanate|Asahan]], [[Langkat Sultanate]], Maropat, Lingga.

Malacca fell to the [[Dutch East India Company]] (the VOC) in 1641. Coastal areas of North Sumatra felt economic impacts as the VOC subsequently reduced the presence of trade in [[Malacca]] and shifted resources towards [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]. Still, North Sumatra also saw an increase in Arab, Chinese and Indian traders. 

After Britain gained a position on the nearby island of [[Penang]],{{clarify|reason=when?|date=July 2024}} the British traded heavily with the east coast of Sumatra. Prior to the nineteenth century, Dutch power was concentrated on the island of Java and parts of the Moluccas. In the nineteenth century, the Dutch began to focus more on to areas outside Java, including North Sumatra, driving out British influence. Dutch control was formalized with the handover of most of Indonesia in the [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1814|1814 Treaty of London]], which was renewed in the [[Treaty of London (1824)|1824 Treaty of London]]. However, the UK maintained a presence in several places that were considered important for trade, including parts of Sumatra and Kalimantan.

During the [[Padri War]], in the years prior to 1860, Dutch forces arrived in South Tapanuki at the request of a local leader to provide protection. The [[Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura|Siak sultan]] subsequently signed a treaty with the [[Dutch East Indies]] government recognizing Dutch authority over it and the sultanates of [[Asahan Sultanate|Asahan]], [[Sultanate of Serdang|Serdang]], [[Sultanate of Deli|Deli]] and [[Sultanate of Langkat|Langkat]]. The Dutch proceeded further into Batakland and North Sumatra, invading Toba, Karo Highland, Nias and Silindung with the help of Christian missionaries, such as [[Ludwig Ingwer Nommensen]], who worked to [[Christianization|Christianize]] the area. The Dutch invasion into Batakland met resistance by [[Sisingamangaraja XII]], causing a guerilla war lasting 30 years until and Sisingmangaraja XII's death in battle and a subsequent Dutch victory. Meanwhile, particularly after 1869, Dutch tobacco plantation activities expanded on the east coast, including the estab;ishment of [[Deli Maatschappij]] and ''London Sumatra'', using land leased from the Malay sultans. As there was a worker shortage, the Dutch began importing labourers from [[Java Island|Java]], [[Southern China]] and [[Southern India]]. This first big wave of migration established substantial [[Javanese people|Javanese]], [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], and [[Indian Indonesians|Indian]] populations in North Sumatra that remain to this day. By 1874, the sultanates had been formally included within the Dutch East Indies, and in Deli, the sultan of Deli granted the Dutch sole rights over taxation and leases, in exchange for an annual pension. That year, the [[Sumatra's East Coast Residency|East Coast Residency]] was established.<ref>{{cite thesis |last= Van Langenberg |first= Michael John|date= 1976 |title= National revolution in north Sumatra: Sumatera Timur and Topanuli, 1942-1950|url= https://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/handle/2123/13501.2/0000000619343775_a_r.pdf?sequence=8&isAllowed=y|degree= Doctor of Philosophy|publisher= The University of Sydney |pages=15–23 |access-date= 12 August 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last= Dootjes |first= F.J.J. |editor=Koninklijk Instituut voor de Tropen | title= Bulletin of the Colonial Institute of Amsterdam |publisher= Kominklijk Instituut voor de Troopen |date= November 1938 |volume = 2 |number = 1 |pages= 45–55 |chapter=Deli, the Land of Agricultural Enterprises }}</ref>

On March 12, 1942, Japanese forces landed in Palubuhan Ruku on the east coast, and advanced on Medan. The advance force reported it had captured the town the next day. The main force followed on bicycles. There was some resistance from the Dutch forces, particularly around [[Pematangsiantar]], but the last major town, [[Sibolga]], fell on 15 March. During the Japanese occupation of North Sumatra, the leader of the Japanese Armed Forces was centred in [[Bukittinggi]], moving the de facto capital out of the Dutch centre of Medan. The occupation lasted 3 years. In 1945 the Japanese occupation officially ended with [[VJ Day|Japan's surrender in the Pacific]] and two days later [[Sukarno]] declared [[Indonesian Declaration of Independence|Indonesian Independence]], beginning the four-year [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian War of Independence]] against the Dutch.<ref>{{cite book  | author = War History Office of the National Defense College of Japan  | title = The Invasion of the South: Army Air Force Operations, and the Invasion of Northern and Central Sumatra |pages=427–428 | publisher = Leiden University Press  | editor-first = Willem |editor-last =Remmelink | date = 2021 | url = https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A3166103/view |isbn=9789400604100}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kahin|first=Audrey|date=1974|title=Some Preliminary Observations on West Sumatra during the Revolution|url=https://ecommons.cornell.edu/server/api/core/bitstreams/a95304df-113f-4e71-b834-bf8499df717a/content|journal=Indonesia|issue=18|page=77}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Ricklefs | first = M.C. | author-link = M.

Armed {{lang|id|pergerakan}} groups (Indonesian nationalists) conducted mass killings of the members of aristocratic families.{{sfn|Said|1973|p=}} To opportunistic {{lang|id|pergerakan}} militants (including [[Communist Party of Indonesia]] members Xarim MS and Luat Siregar), the revolutionary movement was seen as a means for East Sumatra to be freed from colonial rule and to join the larger [[Indonesian National Revolution]].{{sfn|Kahin|1970|p=180}} Participants of the revolution were believed to be provoked by leaders to kill aristocrats and create violence with three prime objectives: to eliminate the sultans and aristocrats (who were seen as Dutch allies), to seize their wealth (to fund the Indonesian independence campaign), and to eliminate the region's feudal social structure.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Reid |first=Anthony |title=An Indonesian Frontier: Acehnese and Other Histories of Sumatra |year=2005 |publisher=Brill |isbn=978-90-04-48655-3 |page=328 }}</ref> 

The Dutch authorities, working with the East Sumatra Union (''Persatuan Sumatra Timur''), which had been formed in 1938 by westernized Malay elites to reassert [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malay]] and [[Simalungun people|Simalungun]] ethnic interests, established the [[State of East Sumatra]] ({{langx|id|Negara Sumatra Timur (NST)}}) as part of the planned [[United States of Indonesia]]. The state lasted from December 1947 to August 1950.{{sfn|Langenberg|1982|pp=1–30}} In addition to the Dutch, the NST state was supported by Malay aristocrats, most of the Simalungun rajas, some [[Karo people (Indonesia)|Karo]] chieftains, and Chinese groups who felt that the revolution threatened their interests. Dr Tengku Mansu, a member of the Asahan royal family, was selected as head of state for the NST. While the Dutch wanted the NST to be seen as an orderly and progressive alternative to the republic, western-educated aristocrats saw it as a bastion for their own ethnic interests.{{sfn|Reid|2014|p=}} Following the [[Dutch-Indonesian Round Table Conference]] in late 1949, the Dutch withdrew military support for the State of East Sumatra and its local authority began to collapse. The short-lived state was viewed with suspicion, and Dr Tengku Mansur entered into negotiations with [[Mohammad Hatta]] to reunify East Sumatra with the Republic of Indonesia in May 1950. Mansur surrendered authority to the republic and East Sumatra merged with Tapanuli to become the province of North Sumatra on August 15, 1950.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Reid|first1=Anthony|title=The Birth of the Republic in Sumatra |journal=Indonesia |date=1971 | volume=12 |issue=Oct |url=https://ecommons.cornell.edu/bitstream/handle/1813/53522/INDO_12_0_1107125075_21_46.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y |pages=21–46|doi=10.2307/3350656|jstor=3350656 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite book | last = Reid | first = Anthony| author-link = Anthony Reid | title = The Blood of the People: Revolution & the End of Traditional Rule in Northern Sumatra | publisher = NUS Press | year = 2014 | location = Singapore | isbn = 978-9971-69-637-5 |page = 262}}</ref>

After Indonesian independence, at the first session of the National Committee of Regions (KND), Sumatra was divided into three sub-provinces: North Sumatra, [[Central Sumatra]] and [[South Sumatra]]. North Sumatra was an amalgamation of three administrative regions called Residencies: the Residency of Aceh, the East Sumatra Residency, and the Residency of Tapanuli. The publication of the ''Law of the Republic of Indonesia (R.I.) No. 10, Year 1948'' on April 15, 1948, formalized the division of these three provinces. The date of 15 April 1948 has been subsequently celebrated as the anniversary of North Sumatra Province.

Act R.I. No. 24 of 1956, promulgated on December 7, 1956, re-established an autonomous Aceh Province, independent of the Province of North Sumatra.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sumutprov.go.id/tentang-provsu/sejarah |title=Sejarah Pemerintah Provinsi Sumatra Utara |access-date=2017-01-06 |archive-date=2016-11-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104192543/http://www.sumutprov.go.id/tentang-provsu/sejarah |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Geography ==
[[File:Sunrise at Lake Toba.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Lake Toba, world's largest volcanic lake]]

The province of North Sumatra stretches across the island of [[Sumatra]], between the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Strait of Malacca]], with an area of 72,460.74&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. It borders the province of [[Aceh]] to the northwest and [[Riau]] and [[West Sumatra]] to the southeast. The province contains a broad, low plain along the Strait of Malacca on which the provincial capital, Medan, is located. In the south and west, the land rises to the [[Bukit Barisan]] mountain range that runs the length of Sumatra; the mountains here surround [[Lake Toba]], which was formed from the [[caldera]] of an ancient volcano. Several large islands in the Indian Ocean off the west coast of Sumatra are currently part of North Sumatra, most notably [[Nias]] Island and the [[Batu Islands]].{{cn|date=July 2024}}

[[File:Toba overview.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Satellite photo of North Sumatra and Nias Island with Lake Toba in the centre]]

There are 419 islands in North Sumatra. The outer islands include the island of Simuk (the most westerly of the Batu Islands) and the island of [[Berhala Island (Sumatra)|Berhala]] in the Strait of Malacca. The Nias archipelago, located off the coast of western Sumatra in the Indian Ocean, consists of Nias Island and other much smaller islands in its vicinity. Its administrative centre is located at the city of [[Gunungsitoli]] on the northeast coast of Nias. The Batu Islands, just southeast of Nias, consist of 51 islands including three major islands: Pini, Tanahbala and Tanahmasa. Pulau Telo is their administrative centre on the small island of Situasi. Other [[List of islands of Indonesia#North Sumatra|islands in North Sumatra]] include Imanna, Pasu, Bawa, Hamutaia, Batu Makelele, Masa, Bau, Simaleh, Makole, Jake, and {{ill|Wunga Island|lt=Wunga|id|Pulau Wunga}}.{{cn|date=July 2024}}

Half of the province is located on a high plateau that runs along the Bukit Barisan mountains, from central North Sumatra to the western coast. The tallest mountain in the province is [[Mount Sinabung]] in [[Karo Regency]], at elevation around {{convert|2,460|m|ft}}, the most active volcano in the region. Volcanic activities (cracks where steam, gas, and lava are emitted) were observed at the summit in 1912; recent documented events include an eruption in the early hours of 29 August 2010 and eruptions in September and November 2013, January, February and October 2014.<ref name="JPost280910">{{cite web|title=Mount Sinabung in Sumatra erupts|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/29/mount-sinabung-sumatra-erupts.html|work=[[The Jakarta Post]]|access-date=2010-08-29|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100831013538/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2010/08/29/mount-sinabung-sumatra-erupts.html|archive-date=2010-08-31}}</ref> Another volcano nearby is [[Mount Sibayak]], also located in the Karo highland, sitting at an elevation of {{convert|2,181|m|ft}}. Crystalline [[sulfur]] deposits on Mount Sibayak have historically been mined on a small scale, and seepage of sulfurous gases has caused acidic discolouration of its small [[Volcanic crater lake|crater lake]].

[[File:Hutan Gunung Leuser Aceh.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Mount Leuser National Park]]

In North Sumatra, there are currently two national parks: the [[Gunung Leuser National Park]] and [[Batang Gadis National Park]]. According to the Ministerial Decree No. 44 of 2005,{{cn|date=July 2024}} forest area in North Sumatra today covers {{convert|3,742,120|ha|acres}}, consisting of a 477,070-hectare (ha) Natural Reserve Area/Natural Conservation Area, 1,297,330 ha of protected forest, 879,270 ha of limited production forest, 1,035,690 ha of permanent production forest, and 52,7600 ha of production forest that can be converted to another status.

However, the figure above is only [[de jure]]. In reality, the forests are not as large as the figures suggest. A lot of the forests are damaged, due to encroachment and [[illegal logging]]. So far, over 206,000 ha of forests in Sumatra have experienced changes in function. As many as 163,000 ha were converted to plantations and 42,900 ha were transmigration areas.{{cn|date=July 2024|reason=When and according to whom?}}

== Governance ==
[[File:Kantor Gubernur Sumatra Utara 01.jpg|thumb|right|220px|North Sumatra governor main office, Medan]]
The administrative centre of North Sumatra is located in the city of [[Medan]], governed by a [[List_of_current_Indonesian_governors|governor]]. Earlier governments ruled all of Sumatra (1945-1950); and a North Sumatra Province that included Aceh (1950-1956). In 1956, Aceh split off to form a separate Aceh Province.

=== Administrative divisions ===
North Sumatra is currently subdivided into 25 [[Regency (Indonesia)|regencies]] ({{lang|id|kabupaten}}) and 8 autonomous [[Cities of Indonesia|cities]] (formerly municipalities). When originally created as a province with its current boundaries, it was composed of 10 regencies and 6 cities, but an 11th regency ([[Dairi Regency]]) was created on 23 September 1964. Fourteen more new regencies and two new cities were created between 1998 and 2008. All these are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and the 2020 census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2021.</ref> together with their official estimates for mid-2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024"/> Regencies and cities are sub-divided into 455 [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]], which in turn are further sub-divided into 6,110 [[Villages of Indonesia|villages]] (as of early 2024). Proposals have been under consideration since 2013 by the People's Representative Council (''Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat'' or DPR) to create three new provinces from parts of the present North Sumatra: Nias Islands, Tapanuli, and East Sumatra; however since 2013 the Indonesian Government have maintained a moratorium on the intended creation of new provinces, regencies and cities. The present regencies and cities are grouped for convenience below according to the projected new provinces within which they are situated:

{{North Sumatra labelled map|400px|thumb|caption=Regencies and cities of North Smatra}}

====Nias Islands Region====
[[File:House in Nias North Sumatra.jpg|thumb|right|''Omo Sebua'', means "the big house". It refers to a traditional house from South Nias, in which formerly the king of ''Tano Niha'' lived, and is located in [[Bawomataluo village|Bawomataluo]]]].

This region contains the substantial island of [[Nias]] and various small offshore islands, including the [[Batu Islands]] to the south. Originally it comprised a single '''Nias Regency''' (created on 7 November 1956), but on 25 February 2003 the southern part of the island (including the Batu Islands) was split off to form a separate '''South Nias Regency'''. On 29 October 2008 two new regencies - '''North Nias''' and '''West Nias''' - together with the '''city of Gunungsitoli''', were split off from the remainder of Nias Regency.

Notes: (a) UU is an abbreviation from Undang-Undang (the Indonesia statute of law). <br>(b) South Nias Regency includes the [[Batu Islands]].

The region include 124 smaller offshore islands - 87 in South Nias Regency (primarily the Batu Islands), 11 in West Nias Regency, 19 in North Nias Regency and 7 in Nias Regency.

====Tapanuli Region====

This region comprises the southwestern part of the province on the island of [[Sumatra]], and equates to the former [[Tapanoeli Residency]] which existed at the time of independence (except for Nias Island). When the province was created, the region comprised three regencies ('''North Tapanuli''', '''Central Tapanuli''' and '''South Tapanuli''') and the '''city of Sibolga'''. A fourth regency - '''Dairi''' - was created on 23 September 1964 from part of North Tapanuli Regency. Two more new regencies were formed on 23 November 1998 - '''Mandailing Natal''' from part of South Tapanuli Regency, and '''Toba Samosir''' from another part of North Tapanuli Regency. The '''city of Padang Sidempuan''' was split off from South Tapanuli Regency on 21 June 2001. Two further regencies were formed on 25 February 2003 - '''Humbang Hasundutan''' from part of North Tapanuli Regency, and '''Pakpak Bharat''' from part of Dairi Regency. A new '''Samosir Regency''' was created from part of Toba Samosir Regency on 18 December 2003 (more recently, the remaining part of this regency was renamed Toba Regency). Another two regencies were created on 17 July 2007 - '''Padang Lawas''' and '''North Padang Lawas''', both from parts of South Tapanuli Regency.

== Culture ==
North Sumatra hosts various ethnicities, religions and traditions, influenced by the [[Batak]], [[Malay race|Malay]] and [[Nias]] peoples, and other cultures such as [[Chinese Indonesian|Chinese]], [[Indian Indonesian|Indian]] and [[Javanese people|Javanese]].

=== Music ===
The music that is usually played depends on the traditional ceremonies held, but is more dominant with the drums. As in the Coastal Ethnic ({{langx|id|Orang Pesisir}}), there are musical instruments called ''Sikambang''.

[[File:Upacara Tradisi Mangokal Holi.jpg|thumb|right|230px|Bataknese ''Gondang'' [[percussion]] during a local ceremony in North Sumatra]]
The Batak Toba, Pakpak and Simalungun tribes have a musical instrument called ''Gondang'' which is usually played during traditional ceremonies in marriage, death, and so on. Meanwhile, the Mandailing and Angkola Batak tribes have musical instruments similar to the gondang, namely ''Gordang Sambilan''. The Malays in the East Coast have the same musical instruments as the Malays in general, such as the [[accordion]], the Malay drum ([[kompang]]) and the [[violin]]. Meanwhile, in Tanah Karo, there are [[Kacapi|Kulcapi]] and ''Gendang'' musical instruments which are commonly used to accompany the ''Landek'' or ''Guro Guro Aron'' dance.

=== Architecture ===
{{main|Batak architecture}}
In the field of [[fine arts]] that stands out is the traditional house architecture which is a combination of the results of sculpture and carving as well as the results of handicrafts. Traditional house architecture is found in various forms of ornament. In general, the shape of the traditional house building in the Batak traditional group symbolizes "buffalo standing upright" ({{langx|id|Kerbau berdiri tegak}}). This is even clearer by decorating the top of the roof with buffalo heads.

The traditional house of the Batak Toba ethnic, [[Rumah Batak|Ruma Batak]], stands strong and majestic and is still commonly found in Samosir and Lake Toba area. The Batak Karo traditional house looks big and taller than other traditional houses. The roof is made of palm fiber and is usually supplemented with smaller triangular roofs called ''ayo-ayo rumah'', ''Jambur'' and ''tersek''. With soaring multi-layered roofs, Karo's house has a distinctive shape compared to other traditional houses that only have one roof in North Sumatra, there are still several villages in Karo highland that still reserve traditional house and buildings, like in ''Lingga''. The shape of the traditional house in the Batak Simalungun area is quite attractive. The traditional house complex in ''Pematang Purba'' village consists of several buildings, namely the ''Rumah Bolon'', ''Balai Bolon'', drying rack, taboo hall of need, and mortar. The prominent Mandailing buildings are called ''Bagas Gadang'' (house of Namora Natoras) and ''Sopo Godang'' (customary consultation hall).

Malay traditional houses in North Sumatra are not much different from Malay houses in other provinces, only the green and yellow color is more dominant.

=== Dances ===
[[File:Tari-Seni-Landek.jpg|thumb|right|[[Karo people (Indonesia)|Batak-Karonese]] couple doing traditional dance called ''landek'']]

The traditional dance repertoire includes various types. Some are in the form of sacred dances and some are solely for entertainment. In addition to traditional dances which are part of traditional ceremonies, sacred dances are usually danced by dayu-datu. Included in this type of dance are teacher dances and stick dances. Datu danced while swinging a magic stick called Tunggal Panaluan.

Profane dance is usually a young social dance that is danced at a happy party. Tortor is danced at the wedding ceremony. Usually danced by the audience including the bride and young people. These youth dances, for example ''morah-morah, parakut, sipaj ok, patam-patam'' and ''kebangkiung''. Magical dances, such as the ''Nasiraan Tortor Dance, Tunggal Panaluan Tor Tor Dance''. This magical dance is usually performed with great solemnity.

Besides Batak dances, there are also Malay dances such as ''Serampang XII, Gundala-Gundala and Landek'' dance from Karo Highlands, ''Moyo'' and ''Maena'' dance from Nias.

===Handicraft===
[[File:Tenun Ulos.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Local craftswomen weaving [[Ulos]] in ''Huta Raja'' village, Ulos is Bataknese traditional [[Tenun]] which is popular exported as garment from North Sumatra]]
In addition to architecture, [[weaving]] is an interesting craft art from the Batak tribe. Examples of this weave are [[ulos]] cloth and [[songket]] cloth. Ulos is a traditional Batak cloth used in wedding ceremonies, death, building houses, arts, etc. Ulos cloth is made of cotton or hemp yarn. Ulos colors are usually black, white, and red which have certain meanings. While other colors are symbols of the variety of life. In the Pakpak tribe there is a weave known as ''oles''. Usually the base color of the ointment is black-brown or white. In the Karo tribe there is a weave known as ''uis''. Usually uis base colors are dark blue and reddish. In the west coast community there is a woven fabric known as ''Songket Barus''. Usually the basic color of this craft is Dark Red or Yellow Gold.

''Batubara Malay Songket'' is one of the typical crafts of the East Coast that has been worldwide. Songket Batubara has its own characteristics, this can be seen from: The process of making songket still uses wooden looms in the traditional way, but still has good quality, thus this songket is not inferior to songket produced with today's sophisticated machines. The Batubara songket also has a variety of unique motifs such as bamboo shoots, mangosteen flowers, cempaka flowers, Caul buds, ''Tolak Betikam'', and Fighting Dragons. The Batubara songket woven has an attractive design and a high cultural artistic value.

===Culinary===
{{main|Batak cuisine}}
[[File:Batak Cuisine Saksang and Panggang 1.JPG|thumb|right|Bataknese cuisine such as ''Saksang'', ''Babi panggang Karo'' and ''Sayur Daun ubi tumbuk'']]
There is a wide variety of food in North Sumatra, depending on the region. This includes [[Saksang]] and [[Babi panggang|Babi panggang karo]], and in the Pakpak Dairi area, ''Pelleng'' is a very spicy popular typical food. The characteristic of Batak cuisine is its preference for [[andaliman]] (''Zanthoxylum acanthopodium'') as the main spice. That is why andaliman in Indonesia is sometimes dubbed as ''Batak pepper''.<ref name="Kompas.com">{{cite web
