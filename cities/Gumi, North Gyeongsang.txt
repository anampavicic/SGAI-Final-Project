The [[Birthplace of Park Chung Hee|birthplace of South Korean president Park Chung Hee]] is in the city.

==History==
In the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms period]], Gumi was part of the territory of the [[Silla]] Kingdom. The first Silla temple, [[Dorisa Temple]], was constructed here by Monk Ado who is also the one that made [[Jikjisa]].

The city is the birthplace of the 1962–1979 South Korean president Park Chung Hee. It was during his administration that the South Korean government selected Gumi as a site for major industrial development. Gumi developed rapidly during the 1960s, growing from a small [[rural]] town into a large city thanks to huge infusions of development money from the government. It was selected for development for some practical reasons such as its easy access to transportation infrastructure, and its location in the industrialized [[Yeongnam]] region.

==Administrative divisions==
{{See also|Administrative divisions of South Korea}}The city center of Gumi is divided into 17 ''dong'', or neighborhood units. The hinterland is divided into 5 myeon, or rural areas, and 3 eup, or large villages. Sandong was promoted from a myeon to an eup on 1 January 2021.

'''''Geumo Mountain''''' (Geumo San) Provincial Park is a hiking destination. The peak at 976 m above sea level is one of the eight famous spots in the Yeongman area and is the location of the start of the nature preservation campaign in Korea. The park has an amusement area called [[Geumo Land]] and the Geumo reservoir. There are several interesting sites on the mountain that include:<ref>Welcome to Gumi, published by Gumi City, February 2008</ref>

*'''''Doesan Cave''''' named after the Buddhist monk Doesan who attained a state of nirvana in the cave. He was a master of the theory of "divination based on topography" in the later Shilla dynasty.
*'''''Daehye Waterfall''''' is 27 m high and is especially full during the rainy season. It can be completely dry during periods without rain and is frozen in winter.
*The '''''HaeUn Buddhist Temple''''' is also near the top of the cable car route.
*The '''''YakSa Temple''''' is an active Buddhist temple and is said to have been created to commemorate Saint Ulsang's attainment of nirvana. It is sited near the top of the mountain and can be reached both from the peak and by a trail from the bottom. It has a unique bell that sits on a separate spike of rock connected by a suspension bridge.
*The '''''Ma Ae Cliff Buddha''''' (National Treasure #490) is carved into the corner of a cliff face and is thought to have been created during the Goryeo dynasty.

The Doesan Cave, Daehye Waterfall and HaeUn Buddhist Temple are all easily reached by taking the cable car from the entrance of the park and then hiking a short distance. The YakSa Temple and the Ma Ae cliff Buddha statue are both near the summit of Geumo Mountain and require about one to two hours of hiking to reach them.

==Industrial accident==
On September 27, 2012, workers at the Hube Global<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19867454|title=S Korea leak area 'disaster zone'|work=BBC News |date=8 October 2012}}</ref> plant in Gumi were unloading [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) from a tanker when an explosion occurred causing about 8 tonnes of the acid to leak into the surrounding area. The leak caused 5 deaths initially and prompted more than 3000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/news/questions-remain-after-huge-hydrofluoric-acid-leak/5611.article|title=Questions remain after huge hydrofluoric acid leak - News - Chemistry World}}</ref> people to seek medical attention at local hospitals. Local rice and grape crops were ruined because the acid caused them to wither. Approximately 3,200 [[livestock]] were exposed. The acid, which can etch glass and is used in the electronics industry, caused damage to at least 1,000 vehicles. Total damage costs as of October 10, 2012 were about US$16 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/09/world/asia/south-korea-toxic-leak/index.html?iref=allsearch|title=Toxic leak in South Korea sickens thousands, ruins crops |first=K.J. |last=Kwon|publisher=CNN}}</ref>
