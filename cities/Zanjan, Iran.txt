Zanjan is known for its handcrafts such as knives, traditional sandals, called charoogh, and malileh, a handcraft made with silver wires. Zanjani artists make many things like various decorative dishes and their special covers as well as silver jewelry. In ancient times, Zanjan was known for its stainless and sharp knives. But this tradition is gradually becoming extinct by introduction of Chinese-made knives into the market which are far cheaper, more abundant and less artistic {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}. Many villagers today are traditional carpet weavers. Zanjan's population boasts the highest level of happiness among the people of 30 other provinces in Iran, according to a detailed survey conducted by [[Iranian Students News Agency|Isna]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.isna.ir/fa/print/91071006411/%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%87%D8%A7%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%83%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AF|title=ایسنا - شادترين استانهاي ايران كدامند؟|work=isna.ir}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Walled enclosure Zengan by Eugène Flandin.jpg|thumb|left|Drawing by [[Eugène Flandin]]]]
According to the ''[[Nuzhat al-Qulub]]'' of the 14th-century Iranian geographer [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] (died after 1339/40), Zanjan was said to have been founded by the first [[Sasanian]] ruler [[Ardashir I]] ({{reign|224|242}}), who named it "Shahin." During the [[Arab invasion of Iran]], Zanjan was conquered in 645 by a force led by [[Al-Baraʼ ibn ʽAzib|al-Barra ibn Azib]]. Medieval geographers generally agree that Zanjan was located in the region of [[Jibal]]/[[Persian Iraq]], near the frontier of the neighbouring region of [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijan]]. Some geographers also include Zanjan as part of [[Daylam]] or [[Ray, Iran|Ray]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2002|p=446}}

After 833, the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] had a chain of forts constructed from Zanjan to [[Ardabil]] to counter the 817–837 rebellion of the [[Khurramites|Khurramite]] leader [[Babak Khorramdin]] (died 838).{{sfn|Mottahedeh|1975|p=75}} In the 10th-century, Zanjan was ruled by local Daylamite dynasties such as the [[Musafirids]] (919–1062).{{sfn|Bosworth|2002|p=446}} According to the 13th-century Arab geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] (died 1229), the Persians referred the city as "Zangan."{{sfn|Le Strange|1905|p=222}} During the [[Ilkhanate]] era (1256–1335), the inhabitants were reported by Hamdallah Mustawfi to have spoken "pure Pahlavi" (''pahlavī-e rāst''), a [[Median language|Median]] or northern form of Persian.{{sfn|Bosworth|2002|p=447}}{{sfn|Yarshater|1988|pp=238–245}}

One important moment in the history of the city was in 1851 when the city became a center for the suppressed Babi religious movement, along with [[Neyriz]] and a fortress known as Shaykh Tabarsi. The forces of the central government captured the Babi fort in Zanjan after a long siege on the orders of Grand [[Vizier]] ([[Prime Minister of Iran]]) [[Amir Kabir]] and killed or expelled the Bab's followers.<ref>Abdu'l-Bahá, Edward Granville. "A Traveller's Narrative Written to Illustrate the Episode of the Báb", Published by Kalimat Press, 2004, {{ISBN|1-890688-37-1}}, {{ISBN|978-1-890688-37-0}}</ref>

Before becoming the capital of the namesake [[Zanjan province]], Zanjan was a county of the [[Gilan province]].{{sfn|Bosworth|2002|p=447}}
