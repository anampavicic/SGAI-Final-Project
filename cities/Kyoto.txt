More than half (56.8%) of Kyoto Prefecture's population resides in the city. The city is the cultural anchor of the substantially larger [[Greater Kyoto]], a metropolitan statistical area (MSA) home to a census-estimated 3.8 million people. It is also part of the even larger [[Keihanshin|Keihanshin metropolitan area]], along with [[Osaka]] and [[Kobe]].

Kyoto is one of the oldest municipalities in Japan, having been chosen in 794 as the new seat of Japan's imperial court by [[Emperor Kanmu]]. The original city, named [[Heian-kyō]], was arranged in accordance with traditional Chinese [[feng shui]] following the model of the ancient Chinese capitals of [[Chang'an]] and [[Luoyang]]. The emperors of Japan ruled from Kyoto in the following eleven centuries until 1869. It was the scene of several key events of the [[Muromachi period]], [[Sengoku period]], and the [[Boshin War]], such as the [[Ōnin War]], the [[Honnō-ji Incident]], the [[Kinmon incident]], and the [[Battle of Toba–Fushimi]]. The capital was relocated from Kyoto to [[Tokyo]] after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The modern municipality of Kyoto was established in 1889. The city was spared from large-scale destruction during [[World War II]] and, as a result, its prewar cultural heritage has mostly been preserved.

Kyoto is considered the cultural capital of Japan and is a major tourist destination. The [[agency for cultural affairs]] of the national government is headquartered in the city. It is home to numerous [[Buddhist temples in Japan|Buddhist temples]], [[Shinto shrine]]s, palaces and gardens, some of which have been designated collectively as a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]]. Prominent landmarks include the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]], [[Kiyomizu-dera]], [[Kinkaku-ji]], [[Ginkaku-ji]], and [[Kyoto Tower]]. The internationally renowned video game company [[Nintendo]] is based in Kyoto. Kyoto is also a center of higher learning in the country, and its institutions include [[Kyoto University]], the second-oldest university in Japan.

==Name==
In Japanese, Kyoto was previously called '''Kyō''' ({{lang|ja|京}}), '''Miyako''' ({{lang|ja|都}}), '''Kyō no Miyako''' ({{lang|ja|京の都}}), and {{Nihongo|'''Keishi'''|{{linktext|京師}}}}. After becoming the capital of Japan at the start of the [[Heian period]] (794–1185), the city was often referred to as [[Heian-kyō]] ({{lang|ja|平安京}}, "Heian capital"), and late in the Heian period the city came to be widely referred to simply as "Kyōto" ({{lang|ja|京都}}, "capital city"). After the seat of the emperor was moved to the city of [[Edo (Tokyo)|Edo]] and that city was renamed "[[Tokyo|Tōkyō]]" ({{Nihongo2|東京}}, meaning "eastern capital"), Kyoto was briefly known as "Saikyō" ({{Nihongo2|西京}}, meaning "western capital"). As the capital of Japan from 794 to 1868, Kyoto is sometimes called the '''thousand-year capital''' ({{lang|ja|千年の都}}).

Historically, foreign spellings for the city's name have included '''Kioto''' and '''Miaco''' or '''Meaco'''.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Editorial Paragraphs |magazine=The Missionary Herald |publication-date=April 1887 |volume=83 |issue=4 |page=126}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Nussbaum |first=Louis-Frédéric |date=2002 |translator-last=Roth |translator-first=Käthe |title=Japan Encyclopedia |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |pages=649 |isbn=9780674017535}}</ref>

==History==
{{For timeline}}

===Origins===
{{main|Heian-kyō}}
Ample [[Archeology|archeological]] evidence suggests human settlement in the area of Kyoto began as early as the [[Japanese Paleolithic|Paleolithic]] period,<ref>{{Cite journal |url=http://www.kyotofu-maibun.or.jp/data/kankou/kankou-pdf/jyouhou/J101.pdf |script-title=ja:旧石器時代の京都 |trans-title=Kyoto in Paleolithic period |author=Nakagaawa, Kazuya |journal=京都府埋蔵文化財情報 |publisher=京都府埋蔵文化財調查研究センター |issn=0286-5424 |volume=101 |date=November 2006 |page=1 |language=ja |access-date=November 27, 2013 |archive-date=February 25, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210225131124/http://www.kyotofu-maibun.or.jp/data/kankou/kankou-pdf/jyouhou/J101.pdf |url-status=live }}</ref> although not much published material is retained about human activity in the region before the 6th century, around which time the [[Shimogamo Shrine]] is believed to have been established.

During the 8th century, when powerful [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] clergy became involved in the affairs of the imperial government, [[Emperor Kanmu]] chose to relocate the capital in order to distance it from the clerical establishment in [[Nara (city)|Nara]]. His last choice for the site was the village of Uda, in the Kadono district of [[Yamashiro Province]].<ref name= KEA1910>Kyoto Exhibitors' Association (1910) ''Kyoto'' Kyoto Exhibitors' Association of the Japan-British exhibition, Kyoto, p. 3 {{OCLC|1244391}}</ref>

The new city, {{Nihongo|[[Heian-kyō]]|平安京||"tranquility and peace capital"}}, modeled after Chinese [[Tang dynasty]] capital [[Chang'an]],<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ebrey |first1=Patricia |last2=Walthall |first2=Anne |title=East Asia: A Cultural, Social, and Political History, Third Edition |publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning |isbn=978-1-133-60647-5| date=2014| pages=79, 148}}</ref> became the seat of Japan's imperial court in 794, beginning the [[Heian period]] of [[History of Japan|Japanese history]]. Although military rulers established their governments either in Kyoto ([[Muromachi shogunate]]) or in other cities such as [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]] ([[Kamakura shogunate]]) and [[Edo (Tokyo)|Edo]] ([[Tokugawa shogunate]]), Kyoto remained Japan's capital until the transfer of the imperial court to [[Tokyo]] in 1869 at the time of the [[Meiji Restoration|Imperial Restoration]].

===Feudal period===
In the [[Sengoku period]], the city suffered extensive destruction in the [[Ōnin War]] of 1467–1477, and did not really recover until the mid-16th century.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/journals/jwh/jwh061p075.pdf |title=Guns and Government: A Comparative Study of Europe and Japan* |last=Stephen |first=Morillo |date=1995 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913234726/http://www.uhpress.hawaii.edu/journals/jwh/jwh061p075.pdf |archive-date=September 13, 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> During the war, battles between samurai factions spilled into the streets, and came to involve court nobility (''[[kuge]]'') and religious factions as well. Nobles' mansions were transformed into fortresses, deep trenches dug throughout the city for defense and as firebreaks, and numerous buildings burned. The city has not seen such widespread destruction since.

In the late 16th century, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] reconstructed the city by building new streets to double the number of north–south streets in central Kyoto, creating rectangle blocks superseding ancient square blocks. Toyotomi also built earthwork walls called {{Nihongo|''odoi''|御土居}} encircling the city. [[Teramachi Street]] in central Kyoto is a Buddhist temple quarter where Toyotomi gathered temples in the city.

===Early modern period===
{{Expand section|date=June 2024}}
In 1603, the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]] was established at [[Edo (Tokyo)|Edo]] (present-day Tokyo), marking the beginning of the [[Edo period]]. Nevertheless, Kyoto flourished as one of three major cities in [[Japan]], the others being [[Osaka]] and Edo. At the end of the period, the [[Kinmon Incident|Hamaguri rebellion]] of 1864 burned down 28,000 houses in the city, which showed the rebels' dissatisfaction towards the Tokugawa Shogunate.<ref name= History>{{Cite book |title=Kyoto; its History and Vicissitudes Since its Foundation in 792 to 1868 |last=Ponsonby-Fane |first=Richard |year=1931 |pages=241}}</ref>

===Modern period===
{{Expand section|date=June 2024}}
At the start of the [[Meiji period]], the emperor's move from Kyoto to Tokyo in 1869 weakened the economy of Kyoto. The modern city of Kyoto was formed on April 1, 1889. The construction of [[Lake Biwa Canal]] in 1890 was one measure taken to revive the city. The population of the city exceeded one million in 1932.<ref name = "historical population">{{cite web |url=https://www2.city.kyoto.lg.jp/sogo/toukei/Population/Data/Estimate/Ward/26100.xlsx |script-title=ja:人口・世帯の時系列データ |publisher=City of Kyoto |access-date=April 15, 2018 |format=XLSX |archive-date=October 17, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171017202136/http://www2.city.kyoto.lg.jp/sogo/toukei/Population/Data/Estimate/Ward/26100.xlsx |url-status=live }}</ref>

There was some consideration by the [[United States]] of targeting Kyoto with an [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] at the end of [[World War II]] because of the possibility that the city's importance was great enough that its loss might persuade Japan to surrender.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/nuclear-vault/2020-08-04/atomic-bomb-end-world-war-ii|title=The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II: A Collection of Primary Sources |website=nsarchive2.gwu.edu |access-date=September 25, 2017 |archive-date=November 16, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181116045217/https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB162/ |url-status=live }}</ref> In the end, at the insistence of [[Henry L.

As a result, Kyoto is one of the few Japanese cities that still have an abundance of prewar buildings, such as the traditional townhouses known as ''[[machiya]]''. However, modernization is continually breaking down traditional Kyoto in favor of newer architecture, such as the [[Kyōto Station]] complex.

Kyoto became a [[city designated by government ordinance]] on September 1, 1956. In 1994, [[Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities)|17 historic monuments in Kyoto]] were inscribed on the list as [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]s. In 1997, Kyoto hosted the conference that resulted in the [[Kyoto Protocol|protocol on greenhouse gas emissions]] ([[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]]).

==Geography==
===Terrain===
Kyoto is located in a valley, part of the Yamashiro (or Kyoto) Basin, in the eastern part of the mountainous region known as the Tamba highlands. The Yamashiro Basin is surrounded on three sides by mountains known as Higashiyama, Kitayama and Nishiyama, with a maximum height of approximately {{convert|1000|m|0|sp=us}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. This interior positioning results in hot summers and cold winters. There are three rivers in the basin, the [[Uji River]] to the south, the [[Katsura River]] to the west, and the [[Kamo River]] to the east. Kyoto City takes up 17.9% of the land in Kyoto Prefecture and has a total area of {{convert|827.9|km²|1|abbr=out|sp=us}}.

Kyoto sits atop a large natural water table that provides the city with ample freshwater wells. Due to large-scale urbanization, the amount of rain draining into the table is dwindling and wells across the area are drying at an increasing rate.

===Climate===
Kyoto has a [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cfa''), featuring a marked seasonal variation in temperature and precipitation. Summers are hot and humid, but winters are relatively cold with occasional snowfall. Kyoto's [[East Asian rainy season|rainy season]] begins around the middle of June and lasts until the end of July, yielding to a hot and sunny latter half of the summer. Kyoto, like most of the Pacific coast and central areas of Japan, is prone to typhoons during the summer and autumn.

===Administrative divisions===
In the 1870s, the city was divided into a northern ward (Kamigyō-ku) and a southern ward (Shimogyō-ku), each working as individual administrative divisions of Kyoto Prefecture. The modern municipality was created by the unification of these wards into the city of Kyoto in 1889.

Due to the creation of new administrative districts and a number of [[Municipal mergers and dissolutions in Japan|municipal mergers]] that took place between the 1920s and the 1970s, the contemporary city of Kyoto is divided into eleven {{Nihongo|[[Wards of Kyoto|wards]]|区|ku}}. The central wards, located to the west of the Kamo River, are small and densely populated. The city hall is located in [[Nakagyō-ku, Kyoto|Nakagyō-ku]], and the Kyoto prefectural offices are located in present-day [[Kamigyō-ku, Kyoto|Kamigyō-ku]].

===Cityscape===
Kyoto contains roughly 2,000 temples and shrines.<ref name="fodors1996">Scott, David (1996). ''Exploring Japan''. Fodor's Travel Publications, Inc. {{ISBN|0-679-03011-5}}.</ref> The main business district is located to the south of the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]]. In the center of the city, there are several [[Shōtengai|covered shopping arcades]] only open to pedestrian traffic, such as [[Teramachi Street]] and [[Shinkyōgoku Street]].

The original city was arranged in accordance with traditional [[China|Chinese]] [[feng shui]] following the model of the ancient Chinese capital of [[Chang'an]]/[[Luoyang]]. The [[Heian Palace|Imperial Palace]] faced south, resulting in Ukyō (the right sector of the capital) being on the west, while Sakyō (the left sector) is on the east. The streets in the modern-day wards of Kamigyō-ku, Nakagyō-ku, and [[Shimogyo-ku, Kyoto|Shimogyō-ku]] still follow a grid pattern. Areas outside of the city center do not follow the same grid pattern, though streets throughout Kyoto are referred to by name, a practice that is rare in most regions of Japan.

Kyoto was the largest city in Japan until the late 16th century, when its population was surpassed by those of [[Osaka]] and [[Edo (Tokyo)|Edo]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Le Japon à l'exposition universelle de 1878. Géographie et histoire du Japon |author=Japanese Imperial Commission |date=1878 |language=fr |page=16}}</ref> Before World War II, Kyoto vied with [[Kobe]] and [[Nagoya]] to rank as the fourth- or fifth-largest city in Japan. Having avoided most wartime destruction, it was again the third-largest city in 1947. By 1960 it had fallen to fifth again, and by 1990 it had fallen to seventh. {{As of|January 2022}}, it was the ninth-largest city in Japan by population and had led the country in population decrease for two consecutive years.<ref>{{cite news|date=August 28, 2022|script-title=ja:京都市の人口減、2年連続全国最多 「9位転落」が迫る背景は？|url=https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/-/866385|work=[[Kyoto Shimbun]]|access-date=September 2, 2022|archive-date=September 1, 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220901231909/https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/-/866385|url-status=live}}</ref> However, the population of the city rises during standard working hours, and Kyoto ranks seventh in Japan in terms of [[daytime population]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stat.go.jp/data/kokusei/2020/kekka/pdf/outline_04.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/https://www.stat.go.jp/data/kokusei/2020/kekka/pdf/outline_04.pdf |archive-date=October 9, 2022 |url-status=live|script-title=ja:令和2年国勢調査 従業地・通学地による人口・就業状態等集計結果|publisher=[[Japan Statistics Bureau]]|access-date=August 23, 2022}}</ref>

Approximately 55% of the total population of [[Kyoto Prefecture]] is concentrated in the city of Kyoto, which is the highest ratio among the prefectures of Japan.

==Government==
The city of Kyoto is governed by the mayor of Kyoto and the Kyoto City Assembly, a [[municipal council]].

===Kyoto City Assembly===
[[File:Kyoto city hall.JPG|thumb|200px|Kyoto City Hall]]

===List of mayors===
Between the founding of the modern city and 1898, the [[List of governors of Kyoto Prefecture|governor of Kyoto Prefecture]] also acted as the mayor of the city of Kyoto. From 1898 through the Second World War, mayors were nominated by the Kyoto City Assembly and appointed by the [[Home Ministry|Minister of Home Affairs]].

Since 1947, mayors of Kyoto have been chosen by [[First-past-the-post voting|direct election]] to four-year terms. As of 2024, there have been ten mayors elected using this system. While some mayors have resigned or died in office, no mayor has lost a reelection bid in the postwar period. In the [[2024 Kyoto mayoral election]], independent candidate [[Koji Matsui (politician)|Koji Matsui]] was elected for the first time, supported by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Liberal Democratic Party]], [[Komeito]], the [[Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan|Constitutional Democratic Party]], and the [[Democratic Party for the People]].

Home to 40 institutions of [[higher education]], Kyoto is one of the academic centers in Japan.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/world/asia/kyoto-uses-its-many-charms-to-attract-foreign-students.html |title=Kyoto Uses Its Many Charms to Attract Foreign Students |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 29, 2014 |access-date=March 2, 2017 |archive-date=October 5, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171005152621/https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/world/asia/kyoto-uses-its-many-charms-to-attract-foreign-students.html |url-status=live }}</ref> [[Kyoto University]] is ranked highly among all universities nationwide, with eight Nobel laureates and two Prime Ministers of Japan among its alumni.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kyoto University |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/kyoto-university |access-date=2024-06-22 |website=Top Universities |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-04-05 |title=Kyoto University |url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings/kyoto-university |access-date=2024-06-22 |website=Times Higher Education (THE) |language=en}}</ref> The [[Research Institute for Mathematical Sciences]] and the [[Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics]], both part of the university, have been affiliated with influential mathematicians and physicists. Private universities such as [[Doshisha University]] and [[Ritsumeikan University]] are also located in the city.

The [[Consortium of Universities in Kyoto]] is a Kyoto-based higher education network consisting of three national universities, three public (prefectural and municipal) universities, 45 private universities, five other organizations, and representatives from the city government. The Consortium does not offer degrees, but allows students of member universities to take courses at other member universities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.consortium.or.jp/english |title=English |publisher=Consortium of Universities in Kyoto |access-date=July 15, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720152009/http://www.consortium.or.jp/english |archive-date=July 20, 2014 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

In addition to Japanese universities and colleges, educational institutions from other countries operate programs in the city. The [[Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies]] (KCJS) is a group of 14 American universities that runs overseas academic programs in Japanese language and cultural studies for university students.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.kcjs.jp/index.html |title=Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies |publisher=Kyoto Consortium for Japanese Studies |access-date=August 17, 2022 |archive-date=August 14, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220814161734/https://www.kcjs.jp/index.html |url-status=live }}</ref> Similarly, the [[Associated Kyoto Program]] runs a study-abroad academic program with a focus on cultural, language, and historical learning in and around the Kansai metropolitan area.

===Railways===
[[File:Kyoto Station building-3.jpg|thumb|The interior of [[Kyōto Station]]]]
Kyoto is served by rail transportation systems operated by several different companies and organizations. The city's main gateway terminal, [[Kyōto Station]], connects the [[Tokaido Shinkansen]] bullet train line with five [[JR West]] lines, a [[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu]] line, and a municipal subway line.

The [[Keihan Electric Railway]], the [[Hankyu Railway]], and other rail networks also offer frequent services within the city and to other cities and suburbs in the [[Kinki]] region. Although Kyoto does not have its own commercial airport, the limited express [[Haruka (train)|''Haruka'']] operated by [[West Japan Railway Company|JR West]] carries passengers from [[Kansai International Airport]] to Kyōto Station in 73 minutes.<ref>[http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/travel/kix/index.html JR-WEST: Travel Information > Access to Kansai Airport] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060407004442/http://www.westjr.co.jp/english/travel/kix/index.html |date=April 7, 2006 }}</ref>

The [[Kyoto Railway Museum]] in [[Shimogyō-ku]], operated by JR West, displays many steam, diesel, and electric locomotives used in Japan between the 1880s and the present.

====High-speed rail====
The [[Tokaidō Shinkansen]], operated by [[Central Japan Railway Company|JR Central]], provides [[high-speed rail]] service linking Kyoto with [[Nagoya]], [[Yokohama]], and [[Tokyo]] to the east and with nearby [[Osaka]] to the west. Beyond Osaka, many trains boarding at Kyoto continue on the [[San'yō Shinkansen]] route managed by JR West, providing access to cities including [[Kobe]], [[Okayama]], [[Hiroshima]], [[Kitakyushu]], and [[Fukuoka]]. The trip from Tokyo to Kyoto takes around 2.5 hours, and the trip from [[Hakata Station]] in Fukuoka to Kyoto takes just over three hours by the fastest train service [[Nozomi (train)|''Nozomi'']]. All Shinkansen trains stop at Kyōto Station, including [[Hikari (train)|''Hikari'']] and [[Kodama (train)|''Kodama'']] trains.

{{Main|Kyoto Municipal Subway}}
[[File:Kyoto subway 20 series unit 31 20220506 Takeda.jpg|thumb|A [[Karasuma Line]] subway train at [[Takeda Station (Kyoto)|Takeda Station]]]]
The [[Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau]] operates the [[Kyoto Municipal Subway]] consisting of two lines: the [[Karasuma Line]] and the [[Tōzai Line (Kyoto)|Tōzai Line]]. The two lines are linked at [[Karasuma Oike Station]] near Kyoto's central business district.

The Karasuma Line runs primarily north to south between the terminal of [[Kokusaikaikan Station]] and [[Takeda Station (Kyoto)|Takeda Station]], and takes its name from the fact that trains run beneath [[Karasuma Street]] between [[Kitaōji Station]] in Kita-ku and [[Jūjō Station (Kyoto Municipal Subway)|Jūjō Station]] in Minami-ku. The Karasuma Line connects to the [[Hankyu Kyoto Main Line]] at the intersection of Shijō Karasuma in Kyoto's central business district and to [[Japan Railways Group|JR lines]] and the [[Kyoto Line (Kintetsu)|Kyoto Kintetsu Line]] at Kyōto Station. In addition, the Transportation Bureau and [[Kintetsu Railway|Kintetsu]] jointly operate through services which continue to [[Kintetsu Nara Station]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]], the capital city of [[Nara Prefecture]].

The Tōzai Line runs from the southeastern area of the city towards the center, then east to west (''tōzai'' in Japanese) through the Kyoto downtown area where trains run beneath the east–west streets of [[Sanjō Street]], [[Oike Street]], and {{Ill|Oshikōji Street|ja|押小路通}}. The [[Keihan Keishin Line]] has been integrated into this line, and thus Keihan provides through services to {{STN|Hamaōtsu}} in the neighboring city of [[Ōtsu]], the capital of [[Shiga Prefecture]]. Within the city of Kyoto, the Tōzai Line also connects to the Keihan lines at [[Yamashina Station]], [[Misasagi Station]], and [[Sanjō Keihan Station]], and to the [[Keifuku Electric Railroad]] at the terminal of [[Uzumasa Tenjingawa Station]].

===Buses===
[[File:Kyoto City Bus 200 Ka 1519.jpg|thumb|200px|A typical Kyoto Municipal Bus]]
Kyoto's [[Kyoto Municipal Transportation Bureau|municipal bus network]] is extensive. Private carriers also operate within the city. Many tourists join commuters on the public buses, or take tour buses. Kyoto's buses have announcements in English and electronic signs with stops written in the Latin alphabet. Buses operating on routes within the city, the region, and the nation stop at [[Kyōto Station]]. In addition to Kyōto Station, bus transfer is available at the intersection of [[Shijō Kawaramachi]], [[Sanjō Keihan Station]], and the intersection of Karasuma Kitaōji near [[Kitaōji Station]].

===Roads and waterways===
[[File:四条京阪前（バス）, Kyoto, Japan (Unsplash).jpg|thumb|200px|[[Shijō Street]]]]
Because many older streets in Kyoto are narrow, there are a significant number of one-way roads without sidewalks. [[Cycling]] is a common form of personal transportation in the city, although there are few areas set aside for bicycle parking and bicycles parked in restricted areas are impounded.

Kyoto has fewer toll-highways than other Japanese cities of comparable size. There are nine national highways in the city of Kyoto: [[Japan National Route 1|Route 1]], [[Japan National Route 8|Route 8]], [[Japan National Route 9|Route 9]], [[Japan National Route 24|Route 24]], [[Japan National Route 162|Route 162]], [[Japan National Route 171|Route 171]], [[Japan National Route 367|Route 367]], [[Japan National Route 477|Route 477]], and [[Japan National Route 478|Route 478]].

The city is connected with other parts of Japan by the [[Meishin Expressway]], which has two interchanges in the city: [[Kyoto-higashi Interchange]] (Kyoto East) in Yamashina-ku and {{Ill|Kyoto-minami Interchange|ja|京都南インターチェンジ}} (Kyoto South) in Fushimi-ku. The [[Kyoto Jūkan Expressway]] connects the city to the northern regions of Kyoto Prefecture. The [[Second Keihan Highway]] is another bypass to Osaka.

Traditionally, trade and haulage took place by waterway, and there continue to be a number of navigable rivers and canals in Kyoto. In contemporary Kyoto, however, waterways are no longer commonly used for transportation of passengers or goods, other than for limited sightseeing purposes such as excursion boats on the [[Hozu River]] and [[cormorant fishing]] boats on the [[Katsura River|Ōi River]].

==Culture==

[[File:Geishas in Kyoto.jpg|thumb|200px|upright=1|Geisha in Kyoto]]
With its 2,000 religious places – 1,600 [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] temples and 400 [[Shinto shrine]]s, as well as palaces, gardens and architecture intact – it is one of the best preserved cities in Japan. Among the most famous temples in Japan are [[Kiyomizu-dera]], a magnificent wooden temple supported by pillars off the slope of a mountain; [[Kinkaku-ji]], the Temple of the Golden Pavilion; [[Ginkaku-ji]], the Temple of the Silver Pavilion; and [[Ryōan-ji]], famous for its [[Japanese rock garden|rock garden]]. The [[Heian Shrine|Heian Jingū]] is a Shinto shrine, built in 1895, celebrating the imperial family and commemorating the first and last emperors to reside in Kyoto. Three special sites have connections to the imperial family: the Kyoto Gyoen area including the [[Kyoto Imperial Palace]] and [[Sentō Imperial Palace]], homes of the [[emperors of Japan]] for many centuries; [[Katsura Imperial Villa]], one of the nation's finest architectural treasures; and [[Shugakuin Imperial Villa]], one of its best [[Japanese garden]]s. In addition, the temple of Sennyu-ji houses the tombs of the emperors from [[Emperor Shijō|Shijō]] to [[Emperor Kōmei|Kōmei]].

Other sites in Kyoto include [[Arashiyama]], the [[Gion]] and [[Ponto-chō]] [[geisha]] quarters, the [[Philosopher's Walk]], and the canals that line some of the older streets.

The "[[Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto (Kyoto, Uji and Otsu Cities)|Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto]]" are listed by the [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]]. These include the [[Kamo Shrine]]s (Kami and Shimo), [[Tō-ji|Kyō-ō-Gokokuji]] (Tō-ji), Kiyomizu-dera, [[Daigo-ji]], [[Ninna-ji]], [[Saihō-ji (Kyoto)|Saihō-ji]] (Kokedera), [[Tenryū-ji]], [[Kinkaku-ji|Rokuon-ji]] (Kinkaku-ji), [[Ginkaku-ji|Jishō-ji]] (Ginkaku-ji), [[Ryōan-ji]], [[Hongan-ji]], [[Kōzan-ji]], and the [[Nijō Castle]], primarily built by the [[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa shōguns]]. Other sites outside the city are also on the list.

Kyoto is renowned for its abundance of delicious Japanese foods and cuisine. The special circumstances of Kyoto as a city away from the sea and home to many Buddhist temples resulted in the development of a variety of vegetables peculiar to the {{Nihongo|Kyoto area|京野菜|kyō-yasai}}. The oldest restaurant in Kyoto is [[Owariya|Honke Owariya]] which was founded in 1465.<ref name="Live Japan">{{cite web |title=Honke Owariya: Inside The Kyoto Soba Restaurant That Was Founded in 1465 (And Is Still Crazy Popular) |url=https://livejapan.com/en/in-kansai/in-pref-kyoto/in-nijo-castle_kyoto-imperial-palace/article-a2000017/ |website=Live Japan |access-date=July 18, 2020 |archive-date=July 19, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719011607/https://livejapan.com/en/in-kansai/in-pref-kyoto/in-nijo-castle_kyoto-imperial-palace/article-a2000017/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Japan's television and film industry has its center in Kyoto. Many ''[[jidaigeki]]'', action films featuring samurai, were shot at [[Toei Uzumasa Eigamura]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pref.kyoto.jp/visitkyoto/en/theme/others/uzumasa_movie/ |title=Welcome to Kyoto — Toei Uzumasa Eigamura Movie Museum |publisher=Pref.kyoto.jp |access-date=March 7, 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100311205036/http://www.pref.kyoto.jp/visitkyoto/en/theme/others/uzumasa_movie/ |archive-date=March 11, 2010}}</ref> A film set and theme park in one, Eigamura features replicas of traditional Japanese buildings, which are used for ''jidaigeki''. Among the sets are a replica of the old [[Nihonbashi]] (the bridge at the entry to [[Edo (Tokyo)|Edo]]), a traditional courthouse, a Meiji Period [[kōban|police box]] and part of the former [[Yoshiwara]] red-light district. Actual film shooting takes place occasionally, and visitors are welcome to observe the action.

The [[Japanese dialects|dialect]] spoken in Kyoto is known as ''Kyō-kotoba'' or ''Kyōto-ben'', a constituent dialect of the [[Kansai dialect]]. Until the late Edo period, the Kyoto dialect was the ''de facto'' standard Japanese, although it has since been replaced by [[Standard Japanese|modern standard Japanese]]. Traditional Kyoto expressions include the polite copula ''dosu'', the honorific verb ending ''-haru'', and the greeting phrase ''okoshi-yasu''.

Kyoto has been the site of many annual sporting events, ranging from the 400-year-old [[Tōshiya]] archery exhibition held at the [[Sanjūsangen-dō|Sanjūsangen-dō Temple]] to the [[Kyoto Marathon]] and the [[Shimadzu All Japan Indoor Tennis Championships]].

Several sports teams are based in Kyoto, including professional [[Association football|football]] and [[basketball]] teams. In football, Kyoto has been represented by [[Kyoto Sanga FC]], a club which won the [[Emperor's Cup]] in 2002 and rose to [[J. League]]'s Division 1 in 2005. Kyoto Sanga began as an amateur non-company club in the 1920s, making it the J. League team with the longest history, although it was only after professionalization in the 1990s that it was able to compete in the Japanese top division. Until 2019, Kyoto Sanga used [[Takebishi Stadium Kyoto]] in Ukyō-ku as its home stadium, but home matches were moved to the city of [[Kameoka, Kyoto]] in 2020. There are also several amateur football clubs based in Kyoto. The amateur clubs AS Laranja Kyoto, [[Ococias Kyoto AC]], and Kyoto Shiko Soccer Club compete in the regional [[Kansai Soccer League]].

Another professional team based in Kyoto is the [[Kyoto Hannaryz]], a men's basketball team in the First Division of the [[B.League]] that plays its home games at the [[Kyoto City Gymnasium]] in Ukyō-ku. Kyoto has also been the home of other professional teams that have subsequently moved or been disbanded. Between 1949 and 1952, the [[Central League]] professional baseball team [[Shochiku Robins]] played home games at Kinugasa Ballpark in Kita-ku and Nishi-Kyōgoku Baseball Park (now known as Wakasa Stadium) in Ukyō-ku. This team eventually became the [[Yokohama DeNA BayStars]]. Kyoto also hosted two teams in the [[Japan Women's Baseball League]] before the league folded in 2021.

[[Company team]]s in Kyoto include two rugby squads, the [[Mitsubishi Motors]] Kyoto Red Evolutions and the [[Shimadzu]] Breakers, which compete in the Kansai regional rugby league [[Japan Rugby League One#Related competitions|Top West]]. In baseball, company teams have competed in the regional JABA Kyoto Tournament annually since 1947.

[[Kyoto Racecourse]] in Fushimi-ku is one of ten racecourses operated by the [[Japan Racing Association]]. It hosts notable horse races including the [[Kikuka-shō]], Spring [[Tenno Sho]], and [[Queen Elizabeth II Cup]].
