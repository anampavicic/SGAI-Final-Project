'''Plzeň Region''' or '''Plzeňský Region''' (also known as '''Pilsen Region'''; {{lang-cs|Plzeňský kraj}}) is an [[Regions of the Czech Republic|administrative unit]] ({{lang|cs|kraj}}) of the [[Czech Republic]], located in the western part of the historical land of [[Bohemia]] and named after the capital, [[Plzeň]]. In terms of area, Plzeň Region is 7,561&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, the third largest region in the Czech Republic. However, with a population of about 585,000 inhabitants it is the ninth most populous region. After the [[South Bohemian Region]] it is the second least densely populated region. The region can be roughly divided into two parts: a highly industrialized north-eastern part with a strong engineering tradition around Pilsen ({{lang-cs|Plzeň}}) and a more hilly and rural south-western part with smaller-sized manufacturing companies processing natural resources.<ref name="businessinfo.cz">{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinfo.cz/en/articles/pilsen-region-7953.html|title=Pilsen region - BusinessInfo.cz|access-date=27 April 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123201108/http://www.businessinfo.cz/en/articles/pilsen-region-7953.html|archive-date=23 November 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The region borders the [[Karlovy Vary Region]] (to the north-west), [[Ústí nad Labem Region]] (to the north), [[Central Bohemian Region]] (north-east), [[South Bohemian Region]] (to the east) and with [[Bavaria]] (part of [[Germany]]) in the south-west and west. The region was established based on the constitutional Act No. 347/97<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usoud.cz/fileadmin/user_upload/ustavni_soud_www/Pravni_uprava/AJ/347_1997_EN.pdf|title=347/1997 Sb. Constitutional Act|access-date=2023-12-16}}</ref> of Collections concerning the formation of higher territorial administrative units. The region and its authorities are specified by Act No. 129/2000 of Collections concerning regions, which came into effect on the day of the regional authorities elections, or on 1 January 2001.

==Administrative divisions==
The Plzeň Region is divided into 7 districts ({{lang-cs|okresy}}):

The districts still exist as regional units though most administration has been shifted to the Municipalities with Extended Competence and the Municipalities with Commissioned Local Authority.

===Municipalities with Extended Competence===
Since 1 January 2003, the region has been divided into 15 "Municipalities with Extended Competence" which took over most of the administration of the former District Authorities. Some of these are further divided into Municipalities with Commissioned Local Authority (in brackets):

==Geography==
[[File:Černé jezero - eastern bank.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Černé Lake in Šumava, eastern bank]]
In the south-eastern part of the region there is a range of [[Bohemian Forest]] mountains. The capital Plzeň is surrounded by Plzeň Basin. The rest of the region is occupied by highlands, namely Plzeň Highlands and Brdy Highlands. The largest part of the region belongs to the drainage basin of [[Berounka]] river. The southern part of the region belongs to the drainage basin of [[Otava (river)|Otava]] River.

The agricultural land covers 50.2% of the total area of the region, where 67.9% is arable land. Forests cover 39.7% of the total region's area, with higher proportions of forests can be found especially in Šumava, Brdy Highlands and the Bohemian Forest.<ref name="czso.cz">{{cite web |url=http://www.czso.cz/xp/redakce.nsf/i/kraj |title=Kraj &#124; ?S? V Plzni |access-date=2013-10-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005002723/http://www.czso.cz/xp/redakce.nsf/i/kraj |archive-date=5 October 2013}}</ref>

There are raw material resources on the region's territory, such as coal, heat-resistant and ceramic clays, and building stone limestone. The conditions for farming are quite favourable as well.<ref name="businessinfo.cz"/>

The climate of the region is influenced by the western and south-western winds from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], which bring the largest part of the regional precipitation. The climate varies considerably within the region.

==Economy==
[[File:Pilsner.Urquell.JPG|thumb|120px|left|Pilsner Urquell beer]]
Plzeň Region is average in economic development when compared to the rest of the Czech Republic. In 2021, the region produced 4.87% of the national [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]]. The region's total GDP was CZK 297.919 billion (EUR 12.4 billion) and per capita GDP was CZK 504,354 which was the fourth highest regional result out of fourteen. The most significant sectors in the region are engineering, food processing, building materials industry, ceramics industry, energy production and metallurgy. In 2010 there were 207,000 people employed in the region, accounting for 36% of the total population. In 2011, the business sector in the Plzeň Region comprised 147,000 entities, the majority of which were sole traders. 40% of all economic subjects were based in Plzeň area. The average wage in the region in September 2013 was CZK 23,105 (approximately EUR 905). Compared to other Czech regions, the Plzeň Region has a relatively low level of unemployment (6.07% as of September 2013).

[[File:Brewery Plzen 159.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Pilsner Urquell beer]]
The most significant engineering company in the region is supposedly [[Škoda Works|Škoda Machine Tool a.s.]] producing for example milling and boring machines, centre lathes, turntables, etc. Other important industrial companies are DIOSS Nýřany a.s. (accumulators and batteries), Okula Nýrsko a.s. (processing of plastics) and Lasselsberger s.r.o (ceramics industry). A number of foreign investors based their establishments in the region in the recent decades, namely Panasonic AVC Networks Czech s.r.o. (flat screen displays production), Yazaki Wiring Technologies Czech s.r.o (components for automobile industry), Vishay Electronic s.r.o. (production of electric components), Borgers Cs spol. s.r.o. (plastic products), etc.

Among important food processing companies of the region belong:
* [[Pilsner Urquell Brewery]] (Czech: ''Plzeňský Prazdroj a.s.''), which was established in 1843 and is the largest Czech beer exporter;
* Stock Plzeň a.s., the largest Czech producer of liquors;
* Bohemia Sekt Českomoravská vinařská a.s., an important Czech producer of wines, based in Starý Plzenec

The road network of the region consists of 5,129&nbsp;km of road, whereof 109&nbsp;km are motorways. The main motorway in the region is the [[D5 motorway (Czech Republic)|D5 motorway]] connecting Plzeň with Prague and Germany. As of 1 January 2011 there was 711&nbsp;km of railways.<ref name="czso.cz"/>

==Environment==
Compared to the rest of the Czech Republic, the quality of the environment may be regarded as good. Specific emissions in the region are lower than the national average. The least damaged areas comprise the mountainous parts of Šumava, the Bohemian Forest, western parts of Brdy Highlands, and the areas surrounding the municipalities of [[Manětín]] and [[Nečtiny]]. The protection of the environment in Šumava has been ensured by the establishment of [[Šumava National Park]] and the Šumava Landscape Protected Area. In 2005, the Protected Landscape Area Bohemian Forest was newly designated. There are 182 small protected areas in the Region and several wildlife parks have been
designated to conserve the landscape variability.

On the other hand, the environment is severely damaged in [[Plzeň]]. Specific emissions reported for the [[Plzeň-City District]] are several times above the national average. Plzeň and its surroundings suffer from heavy road traffic and high concentration of industrial activities. The traffic worsens quality of the environment by emissions (nitrogen oxides, hydrocarbons) and noise. Moreover, the areas surrounding the municipalities [[Nýřany]], [[Tlučná]], [[Vejprnice]], [[Břasy]], [[Radnice]], [[Stříbro]] and [[Ejpovice]] were affected by mining or quarrying activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.czso.cz/eng/redakce.nsf/i/xp |title=Regional Office Plzen &#124; CZSO |access-date=2013-10-12 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014011737/http://www.czso.cz/eng/redakce.nsf/i/xp |archive-date=14 October 2013}}</ref>

==Cross-border cooperation==
Since 1993, [[Domažlice District]], [[Klatovy District]] and [[Tachov District]] have been using the European support programme of the cross-border cooperation. The municipalities in the border areas of the Czech Republic and Germany form two Euroregions: the Bohemian Forest- the Bavarian Forest–Mühlveiertel and Egrensis. Cross-border co-operation with Bavaria on the Euroregional basis helps moderate social-economic differences.<ref name="businessinfo.cz"/>

==Tourism and culture==
[[File:Kladruby5.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Kladruby monastery]]
[[File:Chodsky hrad.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Domažlice]]
The region is attractive for tourists. Plzeň offers many historical landmarks and natural points of interest. Tourists are also attracted by a dense network of recreation and hiking trails, zoological and botanical gardens in Plzeň and hills in its surroundings – Krkavec, Chlum and Sylván with observation towers.
