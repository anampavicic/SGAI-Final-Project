==Etymology==
According to the Ministry of Municipality and Environment, the name "Doha" originated from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] term "dohat", which means "roundness". This name is derived from the rounded bays surrounding the area's coastline.<ref name="gis">{{cite web|url=http://geoportal.gisqatar.org.qa/qmape/index.html|title=District map|publisher=The Centre for Geographic Information Systems of Qatar|access-date=29 May 2018|archive-date=20 November 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221120195155/http://geoportal.gisqatar.org.qa/qmape/index.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==History==
In 1950, prior to the official establishment of Ad-Dawhah municipality, Phillip L. Plant, British adviser to the Emir, initiated the first municipal projects in Qatar. Starting with remodeling the old complex of the [[Old Amiri Palace]], Plant then initiated the construction of a seaside road about a half-mile in length which opened up and made accessible the half dozen [[Jetty|jetties]] along Doha's most built-up section.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/the-political-situation-and-social-problems-in-qatar/mode/2up|title=Transmitting Memorandum by Consul M.R.

In 1981, an extensive survey of plants in Doha revealed that the total cultivated area was approximately 265,650 square meters. The number of standing trees that year was 16,909, and there were 26,560 flowering shrubs. The green area planted in 1981 covered about 209,349 square meters, and at least 89 agricultural projects were implemented.<ref name="rayagardens">{{cite web|url=https://www.raya.com/2023/09/16/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%84%d9%88%d9%84-%d8%b5%d9%81%d8%ad%d8%a9-%d8%a3%d8%b3%d8%a8%d9%88%d8%b9%d9%8a%d9%91%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%b5%d8%af%d8%b1-%d9%83%d9%84-%d8%b3%d8%a8%d8%aa-%d9%88-5/|title=المساحات الخضراء بمدينة الدوحة بلغت أكثر من مليون متر مربع|publisher=Al Raya|language=Arabic|date=10 August 1986|accessdate=9 June 2024}}</ref>

Municipal authorities began an extensive campaign to create names for streets throughout Doha in the 1980s. In 1985, they began to develop signage for every street.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.raya.com/2023/06/17/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%84%d9%88%d9%91%d9%84-%d8%b5%d9%81%d8%ad%d8%a9%d9%8c-%d8%a3%d8%b3%d8%a8%d9%88%d8%b9%d9%8a%d9%91%d8%a9%d9%8c-%d8%aa%d8%b5%d8%af%d8%b1-%d9%83%d9%84-%d8%b3-4/|title=قريبا .. يبدأ تركيب لوحات بأسماء وأرقام الشوارع والمباني بالدوحة|publisher=Al Raya|language=Arabic|date=12 March 1985|accessdate=10 June 2024}}</ref> An alphabetical deed system for every building parcel in Doha was developed, with the Real Estate Registration and Documentation Department photographing and copying to [[microfilm]] the deeds to buildings.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.raya.com/2023/01/14/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%84%d9%88%d9%91%d9%84-%d8%b5%d9%81%d8%ad%d8%a9-%d8%a3%d8%b3%d8%a8%d9%88%d8%b9%d9%8a%d9%91%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%b5%d8%af%d8%b1-%d9%83%d9%84-%d8%b3%d8%a8%d8%aa-57/|title=تطوير الفهرس الهجائي بالإدارة ليشمل جميع المالكين إدخال نظام الكمبيوتر لتسهيل البحث عن المعاملات|publisher=Al Raya|language=Arabic|date=26 November 1985|accessdate=10 June 2024}}</ref> Also in 1985, the Planning Department of Doha Municipality initiated a campaign to demolish old and abandoned buildings in downtown Doha and to redevelop its ring roads.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.raya.com/2023/02/25/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%84%d9%88%d9%84-%d8%b5%d9%81%d8%ad%d8%a9-%d8%a3%d8%b3%d8%a8%d9%88%d8%b9%d9%8a%d9%91%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%b5%d8%af%d8%b1-%d9%83%d9%84-%d8%b3%d8%a8%d8%aa-%d9%88-4/|title=مسئوليتنا تخطيط وتقسيم مدينة الدوحة لتصبح مدينة نموذجية|publisher=Al Raya|language=Arabic|date=5 March 1985|accessdate=10 June 2024}}</ref>

The government spent an exorbitant amount of money on buying back land from tribal landowners in the city. Between 1975 and 1985, approximately QAR 4 billion was spent on the process, resulting in an increase of 3.1 square kilometers in the developed area of downtown Doha. From 1981 to 1985, Doha Municipality invested QAR 371 million into large-scale developments in the city and QAR 136 million into developing and maintaining parks and landscaping.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.raya.com/2023/02/11/%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b1%d8%a7%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d9%84%d9%88%d9%84-%d8%b5%d9%81%d8%ad%d8%a9-%d8%a3%d8%b3%d8%a8%d9%88%d8%b9%d9%8a%d9%91%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%b5%d8%af%d8%b1-%d9%83%d9%84-%d8%b3%d8%a8%d8%aa-%d9%88-2/|title=٤ مليارات ريال حجم الانفاق الحكومى للأراضي خلال عشر سنوات|publisher=Al Raya|language=Arabic|date=13 July 1985|accessdate=10 June 2024}}</ref>
