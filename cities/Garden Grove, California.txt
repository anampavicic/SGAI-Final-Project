'''Garden Grove''' is a city in northern [[Orange County, California]], United States. The population was 171,949 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]]. [[California State Route 22|State Route 22]], also known as the [[Garden Grove Freeway]], passes through the city in an east–west direction. The western portion of the city is known as [[West Garden Grove]].

==History==
[[File:Garden Grove Methodist Church (43289714010).jpg|thumb|left|Garden Grove, c. 1950s]]

===19th century===
Garden Grove was founded by [[Alonzo Cook]] in 1874. A school district and [[Methodist]] church were organized that year. It remained a small rural crossroads and farming community until the arrival of the Pacific Electric Railroad in 1905. The rail connection helped the town prosper with the influx of tourists, visitors and eventually settlers,<ref>{{cite web |title=History of Garden Grove, From Community to Town |url=https://ggcity.org/history#:~:text=By%20the%20time%20Orange%20County,and%20before%20long%2C%20more%20settlers. |website=ggcity.org |publisher=Garden Grove City |access-date=March 11, 2022}}</ref> and it was noted for its crops of [[Orange (fruit)|oranges]], walnuts, [[chili pepper]]s and later strawberries.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Garden Grove {{!}} California, United States|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Garden-Grove|access-date=September 1, 2021|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref>

===20th century===
In 1933, much of the town's central business district was destroyed by the [[Long Beach earthquake]], and one person was killed at the high school. The post-[[World War II]] boom led to rapid development, and Garden Grove was incorporated as a city in 1956 with about 44,000 residents.<ref>[https://ggcity.org/history History]</ref>

In 1956, [[Orange County Plaza]] (now The Promenade) was opened at Chapman and Brookhurst, and upon its expansion in 1959, it had 60 stores, including a [[J. C. Penney]], 2 variety stores and 2 supermarkets, and billed itself as both the largest and the first regional shopping center in Orange County.<ref>{{cite news |title=Merchants announce new store opening |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/19872435/the-los-angeles-times/ |work=Los Angeles Times |date=October 28, 1956 |page=131}}</ref><ref name="Independent Press-Telegram 1959-02-23">{{cite news |title=Orange County Plaza Center will have two supermarkets |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/55211497/orange-county-plaza/ |work=Independent Press-Telegram |location=Long Beach, California |date=February 23, 1959 |page=53}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Sixty Stores Assures Wide Buying Choice |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/55199824/sixty-stores-assures-wide-buying-choice/ |work=Los Angeles Times |date=April 26, 1959}}</ref>

==Geography==
Garden Grove has a rugged set of boundaries with many [[Salient (geography)|panhandles]]. The [[West Garden Grove]] neighborhood is west of [[California State Route 39|Beach Boulevard]] and is largely separated from the rest of Garden Grove by the city of [[Stanton, California|Stanton]], with a small bridge of jurisdiction linking the two along Garden Grove Boulevard. A panhandle in the southern part of the town's borders situated between [[Westminster, California|Westminster]]'s Ward Street to the west and [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]]'s Euclid Street to the east creates a small border with the city of [[Fountain Valley, California|Fountain Valley]]. Other neighboring cities include [[Cypress, California|Cypress]] and [[Anaheim]] to the north, [[Orange, California|Orange]] to the east, and the cities of [[Seal Beach]] and [[Los Alamitos, California|Los Alamitos]] to the west.<ref>{{cite web |title=City Boundaries |url=https://data-ocpw.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/32c59c9efe3f4745a8625e1afb225d07?fullScreen=true |website=Orange County GIS |access-date=January 23, 2021}}</ref>

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|46.5|km2|mi2|1|abbr=on}}, 0.10% of which is water.

==Arts and culture==
Garden Grove is home to two stage theaters, the Gem Theater and the Festival Amphitheater. The Festival Amphitheater hosts Shakespeare Orange County, which presents an annual Shakespeare Festival each summer. Both venues are owned by the City of Garden Grove, but operated by outside entities. 

The [[Garden Grove Playhouse]] used to be an active theatre, now closed down. It was operated by a non-profit group of the same name.

An annual event held over Memorial Day weekend, the Garden Grove Strawberry Festival is one of the largest community festivals in the western United States, attracting an estimated 250,000 visitors.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bharath|first=Deepa|title=Strawberry Festival kicks off today|url=http://www.ocregister.com/news/festival-250817-children-grove.html|access-date= June 1, 2010|newspaper=[[The Orange County Register]]|date=May 27, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.strawberryfestival.org/about.htm|work=Garden Grove Strawberry Festival website|access-date=June 1, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323082703/http://www.strawberryfestival.org/about.htm|archive-date=March 23, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> It began in 1958 and celebrates the city's agricultural past, which includes cultivating crops such as chili peppers, oranges, walnuts and strawberries.

Garden Grove uses a [[council-manager]] form of government.
