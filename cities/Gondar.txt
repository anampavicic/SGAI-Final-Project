'''Gondar''', also spelled '''Gonder''' ([[Amharic language|Amharic]]: ጎንደር, ''Gonder''{{efn|Based on the [[BGN/PCGN romanization]] of Amharic.}} or ''Gondär'';{{efn|Based on the [[EAE romanization]] of Amharic.}} formerly {{lang|gez|ጐንደር}}, ''Gʷandar'' or ''Gʷender''), is a city and [[Districts of Ethiopia|woreda]] in Ethiopia. Located in the [[North Gondar Zone]] of the [[Amhara Region]], Gondar is north of [[Lake Tana]] on the [[Lesser Angereb River]] and southwest of the [[Simien Mountains]]. {{As of|2021}}, Gondar has an estimated population of 443,156.<ref name="2021Pop" />

Gondar previously served as the capital of both the [[Ethiopian Empire]] and the subsequent [[Begemder|Begemder Province]]. The city holds the remains of several royal castles, including those in the [[Fasil Ghebbi]] [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]] for which Gondar has been called the "Camelot of Africa".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20101214215247/http://bjtoursandtrekking.com/tours/index.htm http://bjtoursandtrekking.com/tours/index.htm] Gondar World Heritage Site</ref>

== History ==
=== Origins ===
[[File:Fasilides Palace 02.jpg|thumb|[[Fasil Ghebbi|Fasilides Castle]], founded by Emperor [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]]]]
The term Gondar was first mentioned during the reign of [[Amda Seyon I]] as the name of a regiment of soldiers stationed (likely in [[Wegera (woreda)|Wegera]]) to guard nearby trade routes and control a restive population. In 1636, Emperor [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]] selected Gondar as his camp for the purpose of collecting customs on the trade routes towards the [[Red Sea]]. Tradition states that a buffalo led the Emperor Fasilides to a pool beside the [[Angereb River|Angereb]], where an "old and venerable hermit" told the Emperor he would locate his capital there. Fasilides had the pool filled in and built his castle on that same site.<ref>Richard K.P. Pankhurst, ''History of Ethiopian Towns: From the Middle Ages to the Early Nineteenth Century'' (Wiesbaden: Franz Steiner Verlag, 1982), vol. 1 p. 117.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Uhlig |first1=Siegbert |title=Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha |date=2003 |pages=838}}</ref>

=== 17th century ===
[[File:Gondar 01.jpg|thumb|17th century library and chancellery in Gondar]]
Historian [[Bahru Zewde]] highlighted the significance of Gondar by French travellers as "the Paris of Abyssinia".<ref name=":0" /> Unlike most early modern cities of Ethiopia, Gondar was relatively peaceful and healthier, but there were reported contagious diseases such as malaria. The peaceful state of Gondar led to localities where caravans from Sudan and the Red Sea converged. Fasilides translocation from Danqaz to Gondar also contributed to trading benefits, despite Lent and rainy season prohibited expeditions that made emperors to stay at the capital. Such incident quickly enabled him to prolong his reign and construct many buildings for the purpose of giving capital and additional reforms.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Getahun |first=Solomon Addis |date=2012 |title=Urbanization and the Urban Space in Africa: The Case of Gondar, Ethiopia |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44325777 |journal=Journal of Ethiopian Studies |volume=45 |pages=117–133 |jstor=44325777 |issn=0304-2243}}</ref> He built 7 churches and the 5 emperors succeeded him aided to build several churches and palaces in what is called [[Fasil Ghebbi]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Pankhurst |first1=Richard |title=An introduction to the economic history of Ethiopia, from early times to 1800 |date=1961 |publisher=Lalibela House |pages=125}}</ref>

By the time of Fasilides' death in 1667 Gondar was so well established that his successor [[Yohannes I]] (1667-82) made no attempt to seek out a new capital for himself like the former monarchs. On the contrary, he spent much more time in Gondar then his father had done. Though, he left every year on expeditions before returning to his capital, but spent half the year inside the city. In 1669-70, the Emperor gave orders for the Muslims and Jews to move away from the Christians and form their own sectors in the city. At the same time he ordered that persons lending money should not charge interest. Yohannes seems to have encouraged the embellishment of the city. Like his father he erected a large number of edifices, most notably was a two story library and a chancery with an imposing tower. Yohannes died in July 1682, he "lived for ten days in a great new building" constructed that very year. According to the chronicles, this edifice, which was ornamented in ivory, was built by an architect named Walda Giyorgis who was described as "able, intelligent, and of good renown."<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pankhurst |first=Richard |year=1982 |title=History Of Ethiopian Towns |page=125 |isbn=9783515032049 }}</ref>

Yohannes's successor, [[Iyasu I]] (1682-1706), seems to have been very conscious to maintain the good will of the citizens of Gondar and it was reported that he never closed the doors of his palace, even at night, to give his subjects the impression that he trusted them. Iyasu's reign, like that of his father and grandfather, witnessed considerable building in the city. The Emperor was responsible for the erection of a new castle, and several other churches. The castle of Iyasu, which was reportedly erected by Walda Giyorgis, was described as "more beautiful then the house of Solomon." When Iyasu saw it he is said to have been "full of joy and happiness".<ref>{{Cite book|last=Pankhurst |first=Richard |year=1982 |title=History Of Ethiopian Towns |page=128 |isbn=9783515032049 }}</ref>

=== 18th century ===
Gondar prospered until the reign of [[Tekle Giyorgis I|Tekle Giyorgis]] (r. 1779–1784), appropriately nicknamed Fäsame Mängest ("the End of Government"). This period was characterized by glorious personalities of Emperors such as [[Iyasu I]], [[Bakaffa]], [[Mentewab]], and [[Dawit III]]. All castles and churches were highly centralized for royal nobilities. The French [[Charles Poncet de Brétigny|Charles Poncet]], who has served as physician of Iyasu, offers wrote extensively about the town at the end of seventeenth century. His journey was important for it gave the outside world some information about the country during the period of its isolation, when the great city of Gondar was built. Poncet was the first European observer to describe the city, the existence of which was doubted in European circles where it was generally thought that Ethiopia still possessed no fixed capital.<ref name=":1">{{Cite journal |last=Zewde |first=Bahru |date=1988 |title=Gondär In the Early Twentieth Century: A Preliminary Investigation of a 1930/31 Census |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41965962 |journal=Journal of Ethiopian Studies |volume=21 |pages=57–81 |jstor=41965962 |issn=0304-2243}}</ref> His third palace, Iyasu Palace also known as "Saddle on Horseback" resembles a saddle—to highlight the emperor's horsemanship. As a veteran of eleven battles and tax collector, Iyasu extended his boundary to Egypt, Yemen, and Sudan, and decorated his castle with ivory, mirrors, cedar, and a ceiling covered in gold leaf and precious stones.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2021-11-16 |title=Discover The Rich History Of Gondar A.K.A.

After the death of Iyasu I death in 1706, Gondar became to decline because of most emperors preferred to enjoy luxurious life rather than spending in politics, giving the raise of Tigre Province such as the future capital Adwa in mid-eighteenth century. The event could lead of the ascension of major political figures in the period: Emperor Bakaffa and his widow Empress Mentewab and the first [[Tigray Province|Tigre]] warlord Ras [[Mikael Sehul]]. However, the power was presided to Mentewab and the Amhara lords, where several members belonged to her family. They defended that the Empress should enthroned as Regent for her grandson as she had been for her son a decade and half earlier.<ref name=":2">{{Cite journal |last=Pankhurst |first=Richard |date=1979 |title=An Eighteenth Century Ethiopian Dynastic Marriage Contract between Empress Mentewwab of Gondar and Ras Mika'el Sehul of Tegre |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/615570 |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=457–466 |doi=10.1017/S0041977X00135748 |jstor=615570 |s2cid=154802525 |issn=0041-977X}}</ref>

Mentewab brought her brother Ras Wolde Leul to Gondar and made him Ras Bitwaded. After the death of [[Iyasu II]] on 27 June 1755, Ras Mikael Sehul, who was on the way with guns, carpets, gold, silver and other tribute from Tigre, learnt the news two days later, when they arrived at Sembera Zagan in Wagara. Without any delay, he proceeded to the capital, arriving at morrow, he saw Iyasu II's son [[Iyoas I]], who was child at the time of his reign.<ref name=":2" />

On 7 September 1755, an agreement between the Empress and Mikael involving the marriage of his son Dejazmach Wolde Hawaryat to Mentewab's daughter Woizero Atlas can be seen as the path to supreme power to Gondar. Unbeknownst to him, Mentewab believed that Mikael could cooperate with her and merge their dynastic alliance without awareness of his power and wealth.  Their ceremony was described to be conducted by "great pomp" befitting with daughter of king and queen and "great enjoy" reigned in the House of Tigre ruler. According to chronicle, the marriage took place in Gondar, some three months after the death of Iyasu II and ascension of Iyoas.<ref name=":2" />

In 1767, Ras Mikael Sehul seized Gondar by considering himself the real leader of the [[Gondarine period]]. In May 1769, Mikael killed Iyoas and crowned 70 years old [[Yohannes II]], ushering in the decentralized [[Zemene Mesafint]] (Era of Prince) since then. Upon his arrival in 1770, Wolda Hawariat claimed that Gondar had an epidemic of smallpox, where the chief comes to he capital with "ill of fever".<ref name=":2" />

=== 19th century ===
Accusing Ras Ali II of being alienated to Muslim, Wube of Tigre roused his people against Gondar, and seized the town in 1841. Despite being excommunicated by the church, Ras Ali insisted fighting and attempted to enlist an outlaw named Kassa (future [[Tewodros II]]) to his cause. Kassa as the future [[Emperor of Ethiopia]], considerate himself as descendant of both [[Solomon]] and [[Alexander the Great]] by responding fighting Ali. Through this time, Gondar resembled to base of operations rather than a capital, yet there was small European community with one of these was the British Consul, [[Charles Duncan Cameron]].<ref name=":3">{{Cite book |last1=Ring |first1=Trudy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XMBAwAAQBAJ&dq=tewodros+ii+siege+of+power&pg=PA301 |title=Middle East and Africa: International Dictionary of Historic Places |last2=Watson |first2=Noelle |last3=Schellinger |first3=Paul |date=2014-03-05 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-134-25986-1 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book |first=Stuart |last=Munro-Hay |authorlink=Stuart Munro-Hay |title=Ethiopia: The Unknown Land |publisher=I.B.

Starting from [[Battle of Ayshal]] in 1852,  Kassa refused to order [[Ali I of Yejju|Ras Ali II]], who controlled most princes and regions of northern Ethiopia, for his perennial military expedition against Gojjam. In response, Dejazmach Goshu Zewde of Gojjam, an ally of Ras Ali II, clashed with Kassa's army at the Battle of Gur Amba (27 November 1852). Ras Ali II left Gondar for Debre Tabor to call troops in rival provinces of Tigray, [[Wollo Province|Wollo]], [[Yejju]]. Afterward, he returned to Gondar where Kassa had occupied. In the [[Battle of Takusa]] (12 April 1853), Kassa [[Battle of Debre Tabor|pillaged]] [[Debre Tabor]] in 1852. On 29 June, Kassa proceeded destroying Ras Ali II's Oromo cavalry in one of costliest battles during the Zemene Mesafint, where Ali II died in 1856 after retreating to Yejju.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Ofcansky |first1=Thomas P. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ep7__RWqq4IC&dq=gondar+battle+of+takuza&pg=PA65 |title=Historical Dictionary of Ethiopia |last2=Shinn |first2=David H. |date=2004-03-29 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=978-0-8108-6566-2 |page=65 |language=en}}</ref><ref>R.

In 1854, [[Tewodros II|Kassa Hailu]] took control of the town and called upon its nobles, citizens and clergy to accept his candidacy to the throne. The city assembly proclaimed him King of Kings and many cattle were slaughtered for the occasion and the Emperor gave alms generously to the poor. Tewodros, found it necessary to fight against local rulers and their followers in other areas, and was not attracted to Gondar which moreover seemed to him a symbol of Ethiopia's decadence. In 1864, Tewodros ordered the Muslim inhabitants of the city to convert to Christianity or leave, forcing many of them to flee the country. Relations between Tewodros and Gondar continued to deteriorate because of their suspected complicity in rebellion and the bitter disputes the Emperor had with the clergy. By the end of 1864, Tewodros declared Gondar to be a "town of priests who do not love me!" and ordered the city to be violently sacked and destroyed. His soldiers robbed the priests, burned down their residences, and plundered the monasteries in the former capital.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Ajayi |first=J. F.

Emperor [[Yohannes IV]] spent the first part of his reign in [[Debre Tabor]] as Tewodros had done before him. The disappearance of the Emperor and his court led to a large demographic reduction in the city, Gondar's population, well over 60,000 in the 18th century, was said by some observers to have dwindled to only 8,000 in the 1870s. In the late 1880s, Gondar  suffered serious blows as a result of fighting with the [[Mahdist State|Mahdist]] Sudanese. The Ethiopian historian Blatengeta Heruy Wald Selassie, relates that the Mahdists entered the city in January 1888 "and burnt all the churches. Those who were brave were slaughtered on the spot, while the cowardly fled. The remainder, women and children were made prisoners and taken into slavery." In June of the following year the Mahdists again marched into Gondar and, "massacred the great and the humble, the men and women whom they found." As a result, Gondar towards the end of the century was thus little more than a ghost town abandoned in ruins.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite book |last1=Prunier |first1=Gérard |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KYmMCwAAQBAJ&dq=gondar+yohannes+iv&pg=PA492 |title=Understanding Contemporary Ethiopia |last2=Ficquet |first2=Éloi |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-1-84904-261-1 |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Pankhurst |first=Richard |year=1982 |title=History of Ethiopian towns from the mid 19th century to 1935 |page=55 }}</ref>

=== 20th century ===
In early 1900s, peace and stability resulted in some revival in Gondar's fortunes. Gondar was favorably situated between Sudan to the west, Addis Ababa to the south, and Eritrea to the north and hence enjoyed a sizeable amount of commerce. With thousands of traders traveling from [[Gallabat]] and [[Adwa]], the merchants of Gondar and in Begemder were to find immediate sale for their merchandise. There were Italian representatives residing in Gondar; a merchant named Caremelli imported Italian cotton goods and distributed them in Gondar, and an Italian medical doctor gave free medical service to patients in Gondar. The Arab merchants brought in and sold rifles and revolvers.<ref name=":4">{{Cite journal |last=Ahmad |first=Abdussamad H. |date=1996 |title=Trade and Islam in the Towns of Bägemdir 1900-1935 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/44259280 |journal=Journal of Ethiopian Studies |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=5–21 |jstor=44259280 |issn=0304-2243}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Pankhurst |first=Richard |year=1982 |title=History of Ethiopian towns from the mid 19th century to 1935 |page=344 }}</ref>

The Italian enterprise in [[Italian Eritrea]] began Red Sea commerce instructed by Major Ciccodicola, the Italian Minister at [[Addis Ababa]]. Some two months, Major Ciccodicola communicated to Emperor [[Menelik II]] that [[Ferdinando Martini]] (1897–1907) to get permission for extending mule caravan road from Nuqara to Gondar. He also added that at the completion of the road, it would be owned by the [[Ethiopian government]].<ref name=":4" />

On 17 September, Fano launched a large-scale offensive against Gondar, one of the largest cities in the Amhara region. After heavy fighting, Fano claimed to killed over 100 [[Ethiopian National Defense Force|ENDF]] soldiers and captured 40. The clashes resulted in the deaths of at least nine people and injuries to more than 30 others.<ref name=":0" /> After two days of intense fighting, Fano eventually withdrew from Gondar, as of October 2024 the city remains under Ethiopian government control.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ethiopia’s Amhara rebels beat hasty retreat from fighting |url=https://apanews.net/ethiopias-amhara-rebels-beat-a-retreat-from-fighting/}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{Cite web |date=17 September 2024 |title=Nine dead in renewed fighting in Ethiopia's Amhara region |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/nine-dead-in-renewed-fighting-in-ethiopia-s-amhara-region/7788651.html |access-date=19 September 2024 |website=Voice of America |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=17 September 2024 |title=በጎንደር እና በአካባቢው ግጭቶች ሲካሄዱ መሰንበታቸውን ነዋሪዎች ተናገሩ |url=https://www.bbc.com/amharic/articles/cj4dv94j97go |access-date=21 September 2024 |website=BBC News አማርኛ |language=am}}</ref>

Gondar traditionally was divided into several neighborhoods or quarters. These quarters are: Addis Alem, where the Muslim inhabitants dwelt; Kayla Mayda, where the adherents of [[Beta Israel]] lived; Abun Bet, centered on the residence of the [[Abuna]], or nominal head of the [[Ethiopian Church]]; and Qagn Bet, home to the nobility.<ref name=getamun>{{Cite book|first=Solomon|last=Getamun|title=History of the City of Gondar|publisher=Africa World Press|date=2005|isbn=1569021953}}</ref>{{Rp|16ff}} Gondar is also a noted center of ecclesiastical learning of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and known for having 44 churches – for many years more than any other settlement in Ethiopia. Gondar and its surrounding countryside constitute the homeland of most [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian Jews]].

The modern city of Gondar is popular as a tourist destination for its many picturesque ruins in [[Fasil Ghebbi]] (the Royal Enclosure), from which the emperors once reigned. The most famous buildings in the city lie in the Royal Enclosure, which include [[Fasilides]]' castle, [[Iyasu I|Iyasu]]'s palace, [[Dawit III|Dawit]]'s Hall, a banqueting hall, stables, Empress [[Mentewab]]'s castle, a [[Chancery (medieval office)|chancellery]], library and three churches. Near the city lie [[Fasilides' Bath]], home to an annual ceremony where it is blessed and then opened for bathing; the [[Qusquam]] complex, built by Empress Mentewab; the eighteenth century [[Ras Mikael Sehul's Palace]] and the [[Debre Berhan Selassie Church]].

Downtown Gondar shows the influence of the Italian occupation of the late 1930s. The main piazza features shops, a cinema, and other public buildings in a simplified Italian [[Art Deco|Moderne]] style still distinctively of the period despite later changes and, frequently, neglect. Villas and flats in the nearby quarter that once housed occupation officials and colonists are also of interest.

== Education ==
The town is home to the [[University of Gondar]], which includes Ethiopia's main faculty of medicine. [https://thsc.edu.et/ Teda Health Science College] is also located at this town.
