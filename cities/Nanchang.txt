Located in the north-central part of the province and in the hinterland of [[Poyang Lake]] Plain, it is bounded on the west by the [[Jiuling Mountains]], and on the east by [[Poyang Lake]]. Because of its strategic location connecting the prosperous [[East China|East]] and [[South China|South]] China, it has become a major railway hub in Southern China in recent decades.

As the [[Nanchang Uprising]] in 1927 is distinctively recognized by the ruling [[China Communist Party|Communist Party]] as "firing the first gunshot against the [[Kuomintang|Nationalists]]",<ref>Schwartz, Benjamin, ''Chinese Communism and the Rise of Mao'', Harper & Row (New York: 1951), p. 93.</ref> the current government has therefore named the city since 1949 "the place where the [[People's Liberation Army]] was born", and the most widely known "place where the military banner of the People's Liberation Army was first raised". Nanchang is also a major city, appearing among the top 150 [[List of cities by scientific output|cities in the world by scientific research outputs]], as tracked by the [[Nature Index]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Leading 200 science cities {{!}} Nature Index 2022 Science Cities {{!}} Supplements {{!}} Nature Index |url=https://www.nature.com/nature-index/supplements/nature-index-2022-science-cities/tables/overall |access-date=2022-11-27 |website=www.nature.com |language=en}}</ref> and home to [[Nanchang University]].

[[File:南昌府治圖.JPG|left|thumb|Historical map of Nanchang]]

=== Imperial era ===
The territories encompassing modern-day Jiangxi Province—including Nanchang—was first incorporated into China during the [[Qin dynasty]], when it was conquered from the [[Baiyue]] peoples and organized as Jiujiang Commandery ({{zh|c=九江郡}}).<ref name="diming">{{cite book |script-title=zh:中国古今地名大词典 |trans-title=Dictionary of Chinese Place-names Ancient and Modern |location=Shanghai |publisher=[[Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House]] |year=2006 |page=2080 |isbn=9787532617432}}</ref>  In 201 BC, during the [[Han dynasty]], the city was given the Chinese name Nanchang and became the administrative seat of Yuzhang Commandery ({{zh|c=豫章郡 |labels=no}}), and was governed by [[Guan Ying]], one of [[Emperor Gaozu of Han]]'s generals.<ref name="diming" /> The name Nanchang means "southern flourishing", derived from a motto of developing what is now southern China that is traditionally attributed to Emperor Gaozu himself.<ref name="diming" />

In AD 589, during the [[Sui dynasty]], this [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] was changed into a prefecture named Hongzhou ({{zh|c=洪州 |labels=no}}), and after 763 it became the provincial center of [[Jiangxi]], which was then beginning the rapid growth that by the 12th century made it the most populous [[Province (China)|province in China]].

In 653 the [[Tengwang Pavilion]] was constructed, and in 675 [[Wang Bo (poet)|Wang Bo]] wrote the classic "[[Tengwang Ge Xu]]", a poetic introductory masterpiece celebrating the building, making the building, the city, and the author himself known to literate Chinese-speaking population ever since.<ref name="Wang3">Wang: 236-246.</ref> The Pavilion has been destroyed and rebuilt several times throughout history.<ref name="Wang1">Wang: 1.</ref> Its present form was reconstructed in the 1980s after being destroyed in 1929 during the [[Chinese Civil War]].<ref name="Wang2">Wang: 31.</ref>

In 959, under the [[Southern Tang]] regime, Nanchang was made superior prefecture and the southern capital. After the conquest by the [[Song dynasty|Song]] regime in 981 it was reverted to the name Hongzhou. In 1164 it was renamed Longxing prefecture, which name it retained until 1368. During the Yuan dynasty it was the capital of [[Jiangxi province (Yuan dynasty)|Jiangxi Province]], an area that included [[Guangdong]] as well. At the end of the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] ([[Mongol]]) period (1279–1368), it became a battleground between [[Zhu Yuanzhang]], the founder of the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), and the rival local warlord, [[Chen Youliang]]. At the beginning of the 16th century it was the power base from which [[Zhu Chenhao]], the Prince of Ning, launched a rebellion against [[Zhengde Emperor|the emperor]].

During the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]], it might have been the centre of porcelain trade.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Wang Dayuan - Singapore History|url=https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/61d49d33-d5cd-48fc-b91b-652ca64e87c4|access-date=2021-04-01|website=eresources.nlb.gov.sg}}</ref>

During the reign of the [[Wanli Emperor]] of the [[Ming dynasty]], it housed relatives of the emperor who had been exiled because they were potential claimants of the imperial throne, members of the imperial family constituting about one quarter of the city's population; as a result of this, [[Matteo Ricci]] came here when trying to gain entry to Beijing.<ref>Mary Laven, Mission to China: Matteo Ricci and the Jesuit Encounter with the East, {{ISBN|0-571-22517-9}}, 2011, p. 103</ref>

In the 1850s it suffered considerably as a result of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1850–64), and its importance as a commercial centre declined as the overland routes to [[Guangzhou|Canton]] were replaced by coastal [[steamship]] services in the latter half of the 19th century. Nanchang has, however, remained the undisputed regional metropolis of Jiangxi.

=== Republican era ===
On August 1, 1927, Nanchang was the site of one of a series of insurrections organized by the [[Chinese Communist Party|communists]]. The [[Nanchang Uprising]], led by pro-communist [[Kuomintang]] officers under [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] direction, succeeded in holding the city for only a few days, and provided a core of troops and a method of organization from which the [[People's Liberation Army]] (PLA) later developed.

In 1939, the [[Battle of Nanchang]], a ferocious battle between the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] and the [[Imperial Japan]] [[Imperial Japanese Army|Army]] in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] took place.<ref>Hsu Long-hsuen and Chang Ming-kai, ''History of the Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945)'', 2nd Ed., 1971.

=== People's Republic era ===
By 1949, Nanchang was still essentially an old-style administrative and commercial city, with little industry apart from [[food processing]]; it had a population of about 275,000. Nanchang first acquired a [[Rail transport|rail]] connection in 1915, only connecting to the port city of [[Jiujiang]] by the Yangtze. Several other rail links have since been opened. After [[World War II]] a line was completed to [[Linchuan]] and [[Gongqi]] in the [[Ru River Valley]] to the south-southeast.

Since 1949, Nanchang has been extensively industrialized. It is now a large-scale producer of [[cotton]] [[textiles]] and [[cotton yarn]]. [[Paper making]] is also a major industry, as is food processing (especially rice [[Mill (grinding)|milling]]). [[Heavy industry]] began to gain prominence in the mid-1950s. A large thermal-power plant was installed and uses [[coal]] brought by rail from [[Fengcheng, Jiangxi|Fengcheng]] to the south. A [[machinery]] industry also grew up, at first mainly concentrating on the production of [[agricultural equipment]] and [[diesel engine]]s. Nanchang then became a minor centre of the [[automotive industry]] in China, producing trucks and tractors and also accessories such as tires. An iron-[[smelting]] plant helping to supply local industry was installed in the later 1950s. There is also a large [[chemical industry]], producing agricultural chemicals and insecticides as well as pharmaceuticals.
