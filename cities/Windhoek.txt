'''Windhoek''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɪ|n|d|h|ʊ|k}}, {{IPA|af|ˈvəntɦuk|lang|Af-Windhoek.oga|link=yes}}; {{langx|de|Windhuk}} {{IPA|de|ˈvɪnthʊk||De-Windhoek.oga}}; {{langx|naq|ǀAi-ǁGams}}; {{langx|hz|Otjomuise}}) is the capital and largest city of [[Namibia]]. It is located in central Namibia in the [[Khomas Highland]] plateau area, at around {{cvt|1700|m}} above sea level, almost exactly at the country's geographical centre. The population of Windhoek, which was 486,169 in 2023,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Namibia: Regions, Towns, Villages & Settlements - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/namibia/cities/ |access-date=2024-03-16 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref> is constantly growing due to a continued migration from other regions in Namibia.

Windhoek is the social, economic, political, and cultural centre of the country. Nearly every Namibian national enterprise, governmental body, educational and cultural institution is headquartered there.

The city developed at the site of a permanent hot spring known to the local [[pastoral]] tribes. It developed rapidly after [[Jonker Afrikaner]], [[Tribal chief|Captain]] of the [[Orlam]], settled there in 1840 and built a stone church for his community. In the decades following, multiple wars and armed hostilities resulted in the neglect and destruction of the new settlement. Windhoek was founded a second time in 1890 by [[Imperial German Army]] Major [[Curt von François]], when the territory was colonised by the [[German Empire]].

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Windhoek}}

===Etymology===
Theories vary on how the city got its modern name of Windhoek. Most believe it is derived from the [[Afrikaans]] words ''wind'' (meaning wind) and ''hoek'' (meaning corner). Another theory suggests that Captain [[Jonker Afrikaner]] named Windhoek after the [[Winterhoek]] Mountains at [[Tulbagh]] in South Africa, where his ancestors had lived. The first known mention of the name ''Windhoek'' was in a letter from Jonker Afrikaner to Joseph Tindall, dated 12 August 1844.<ref name="DierksK1">{{cite web |url=http://www.klausdierks.com/images/Khauxanas/1introduction.htm |last=Dierks |first=Klaus |author-link=Klaus Dierks |title=The History of ǁKhauxaǃnas.

===Early settlement===
In 1840 [[Jonker Afrikaner]] established an Orlam settlement at Windhoek.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Orlams Afrikaners – the Creole Africans of the Garieb |publisher=Cape Slavery Heritage |url=http://cape-slavery-heritage.iblog.co.za/category/new-creole-identities/page/4/ |access-date=8 July 2010}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He and his followers stayed near one of the main hot springs, located in the present-day [[Klein Windhoek]] suburb.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tonchi |first1=Victor L |last2=Lindeke |first2=William A |last3=Grotpeter |first3=John J |title=Historical Dictionary of Namibia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Mls4H1mnN_0C |edition=2 |series=Historical Dictionaries of Africa, African historical dictionaries |year=2012 |publisher=Scarecrow Press |isbn=9780810879904 |access-date=4 July 2016 |archive-date=21 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210421060538/https://books.google.com/books?id=Mls4H1mnN_0C |url-status=live}}</ref> He built a stone church that held 500 people; it was also used as a school. Two [[Rhenish Missionary Society|Rhenish]] [[missionaries]], [[Carl Hugo Hahn]] and [[Franz Heinrich Kleinschmidt]], started working there in late 1842. Two years later they were driven out by two Methodist [[Wesleyans]], Richard Haddy and Joseph Tindall.<ref>{{cite book |last=Vedder |first=Heinrich |author-link=Heinrich Vedder |title=Das alte Südwestafrika.

A series of wars between the [[Nama people|Nama]] and [[Herero people|Herero]] tribes eventually destroyed the settlement. After a long absence, Hahn visited Windhoek again in 1873 and was dismayed to see that nothing remained of the town's former prosperity. In June 1885, a Swiss [[botanist]] found only [[jackals]] and starving [[guinea fowl]] amongst neglected fruit trees.<ref name="windhoekcc">{{Cite web |url=http://www.windhoekcc.org.na/default.aspx?page=30 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221153905/http://www.windhoekcc.org.na/default.aspx?page=30 |url-status=dead |title=Windhoek City Council: The History of Windhoek |archivedate=21 February 2010}}</ref>

A request by merchants from [[Lüderitzbucht]] resulted in the declaration in 1884 of a German [[protectorate]] over what was called [[German South West Africa]] (''Deutsch-Südwestafrika''), now Namibia. The borders of the German colony were determined in 1890 and Germany sent a protective corps, the ''[[Imperial Schutztruppe for German South West Africa|Schutztruppe]]'' under Major [[Curt von&nbsp;François]], to maintain order.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 338</ref> Von&nbsp;François stationed his garrison at Windhoek, which was strategically situated as a buffer between the warring [[Nama people|Nama]] and [[Herero people|Herero]] peoples.<ref>{{cite news |title=Verona, the last grandchild of Von&nbsp;François |last1=Mbathera |first1=Ester |last2=Pinehas |first2=Tutaleni |newspaper=[[The Namibian]] |date=17 November 2021 |page=6 |url=https://www.namibian.com.na/107420/read/Verona-the-last-grandchild-of-Von-Fran%C3%A7ois |access-date=17 November 2021 |archive-date=17 November 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211117143749/https://www.namibian.com.na/107420/read/Verona-the-last-grandchild-of-Von-Fran%C3%A7ois |url-status=live}}</ref> The twelve strong springs provided water for the cultivation of produce and grains.

Colonial Windhoek was founded on 18 October 1890, when von&nbsp;François fixed the foundation stone of the fort, which is now known as the [[Alte Feste]] (Old Fortress).<ref name="DierkbioV">{{cite web |url=http://www.klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_V.htm |last=Dierks |first=Klaus |author-link=Klaus Dierks |title=Biographies of Namibian Personalities, V (entry for Curt von&nbsp;François) |publisher=klausdiers.com |access-date=1 October 2011 |archive-date=24 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190224104612/http://klausdierks.com/Biographies/Biographies_V.htm |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="curtfarewell">{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63728105 |language=en-GB |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=23 November 2022 |access-date=2022-11-23 |last=Chothia |first=Farouk |title=Namibia pulls down German colonial officer's statue in Windhoek |archive-date=23 November 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221123142819/https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63728105 |url-status=live}}</ref> After 1907, development accelerated as indigenous people migrated from the countryside to the growing town to seek work. More European settlers arrived from Germany and South Africa. Businesses were erected on Kaiser Street (presently [[Independence Avenue (Windhoek)|Independence Avenue]]), and along the dominant mountain ridge over the city. At this time, Windhoek's three castles, [[Heinitzburg]], [[Sanderburg]], and [[Schwerinsburg]], were built.

===South African administration after World War I===
The German colonial era came to an end after the end of [[World War I]] but [[South West Africa]], and with it Windhoek, had already fallen in 1915.<ref>Britannica, [https://www.britannica.com/place/Windhoek Windhoek] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321190021/https://www.britannica.com/place/Windhoek |date=21 March 2019}}, britannica.com, USA, accessed on July 7, 2019</ref> Until the end of the war, the city was administered by a South African military government, and no further development occurred.<ref name=CoWnew>{{cite web |title=The History of Windhoek |publisher=City of Windhoek |url=http://www.windhoekcc.org.na/tour_history_heritage.php |access-date=26 October 2020 |archive-date=29 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201029074218/http://www.windhoekcc.org.na/tour_history_heritage.php |url-status=live}}</ref> In 1920, after the [[Treaty of Versailles]], the territory was placed under a [[League of Nations]] [[League of Nations mandate#Class C mandates|Class C mandate]] and again administered by South Africa.<ref name="geography">Ieuan Griffiths,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40572467.pdf Walvis Bay: exclave no more] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303123113/https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/40572467.pdf |date=3 March 2016}} ''Geography'', Vol. 79, No. 4 (October 1994), page 354</ref>

After [[World War II]], more capital became available to improve the area's economy. After 1955, large public projects were undertaken, such as the building of new schools and hospitals, tarring of the city's roads (a project begun in 1928 with Kaiser Street), and the building of dams and pipelines to stabilise the water supply.<ref name="windhoekcc"/> The city introduced the world's first potable re-use plant in 1958, treating recycled sewage and sending it directly into the town's water supply.<ref>[http://ag.arizona.edu/oals/ALN/aln56/dupisani.html "Surviving in an arid land: Direct reclamation of potable water at Windhoek's Goreangab Reclamation Plant"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606065428/http://ag.arizona.edu/oals/ALN/aln56/dupisani.html |date=6 June 2011}} by Petrus Du Pisani</ref> On 1 October 1966, the then Administrator of South West Africa granted Windhoek the coat of arms, which was registered on 2 October 1970 with the South African Bureau of Heraldry. Initially a stylized aloe was the principal emblem, but this was amended to a natural aloe (''[[Aloe littoralis]]'') on 15 September 1972. The Coat of Arms is described as "A Windhoek aloe with a [[raceme]] of three flowers on an island. Crest: A mural crown [[Or (heraldry)|Or]]. Motto: SUUM CUIQUE (''To each their own'')".<ref>{{cite web |last=Berry |first=Bruce |date=12 February 2014 |url=http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/na-wind.html |title=Windhoek (Namibia) |website=www.crwflags.com |access-date=8 September 2017 |archive-date=7 December 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141207053954/http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/na-wind.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

Windhoek formally received its [[town privileges]] on 18 October 1965 on the occasion of the 75th anniversary of the second foundation of the town by von François.<ref name=Stadtrecht>{{cite news |title=Windhoek erhielt heute Stadtrechte |trans-title=Windhoek received town privileges today |language=de |newspaper=[[Allgemeine Zeitung (Namibia)|Allgemeine Zeitung]] |date=18 October 1965 |edition=2015 reprint}}</ref>

In 1971, the [[1971–72 Namibian contract workers strike|Namibian general contract workers]] started from Windhoek with the goal of abolishing the contract labour system, opposing [[apartheid]], and promoting Namibia's independence.<ref name="general">{{cite journal |last=Rogers |first=Barbara |date=1972 |title=Namibia's General Strike |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4185227 |journal=Africa Today |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=3–8 |issn=0001-9887 |jstor=4185227}}</ref>

===Since Namibian independence===
Since independence in 1990, Windhoek has remained the national capital, as well as the provincial capital of the central [[Khomas Region]]. Since independence and the end of warfare, the city has had accelerated growth and development.

==Economy ==
The city is the administrative, commercial, and industrial centre of Namibia. A 1992/93 study estimated that Windhoek provides over half of Namibia's non-agricultural employment, with its national share of employment in utilities being 96%, in transport and communication 94%, finance and business services 82%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.polytechnic.edu.na/academics/schools/engine_infotech/civil/lecturing/upd410s_module/(11.4)Windhoek%20Structure%20Plan%20Report.pdf |title=The Windhoek Structure Plan |year=1996 |publisher=City of Windhoek |page=6 |access-date=2 July 2013}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Due to its relative size<ref>The second biggest city in Namibia, [[Walvis Bay]], has 43,700 inhabitants: {{cite news |title=ELECTIONS 2010: Erongo regional profile |publisher=[[New Era (Namibia)|New Era]] |url=http://www.newera.com.na/article.php?articleid=14109 |date=16 November 2010 |access-date=16 November 2010 |archive-date=16 March 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316095900/http://www.newera.com.na/article.php?articleid=14109 |url-status=live}}</ref> Windhoek is, even more than many other national capital cities, the social, economic, and cultural centre of the country.

==Transport==

===Road===
[[File:Windhoek-Skyline.jpg|thumb|Windhoek skyline]]
[[File:Independence Avenue Windhoek Namibia.jpg|thumb|[[Independence Avenue (Windhoek)|Independence Avenue]]]]
Windhoek's three main access roads from [[Rehoboth, Namibia|Rehoboth]], [[Gobabis]], and [[Okahandja]] are paved, and are designed to be able to withstand the largest possible flood to be expected in fifty years. Sealed roads can carry traffic moving at {{cvt|120|km/h}} and should last for 20 years.

In 1928, Kaiserstraße, now [[Independence Avenue (Windhoek)|Independence Avenue]], was the first paved road in Windhoek. Ten years later the next one, Gobabis road, now Sam Nujoma Drive, was also paved. Today, out of approximately {{cvt|40000|km}} of Namibia's total road network, about {{cvt|5000|km}} is [[paved road|sealed]].

In 2014, The Roads Authority planned to upgrade the Windhoek-[[Okahandja]]  road to a dual carriageway. It would cost about N$1&nbsp;billion and was expected to be completed in 2021. Later on, they also planned to upgrade the Windhoek and Hosea Kutako International Airport to a dual carriageway. This was expected to be completed in 2022.

As everywhere in Namibia, public transport is scarce and transportation across town is largely done by taxi; there were 6,492 registered taxis in 2013.<ref>{{cite news |title=A glimpse into the taxi industry |last=Shipanga |first=Selma |date=3 April 2013 |work=[[The Namibian]] |pages=6–7}}</ref>

===Air===
Windhoek is served by two airports, with the closest one being [[Eros Airport]], located {{cvt|7|km}} south of the city centre for smaller craft, and the other being [[Hosea Kutako International Airport]], {{cvt|42|km}} east of the city. A number of foreign airlines operate to and from Windhoek. Air charters and helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft rentals are also available.

[[File:Hosea Kutako International Airport, Namibia (2017).jpg|thumb|left|Airport with [[air traffic control]] tower (2017)]]

Hosea Kutako International Airport handles over 800,000 passengers a year. It has one runway without capacity limitations. The other international airport is located in [[Walvis Bay]], with domestic airports at [[Lüderitz]], [[Oranjemund]], and [[Ondangwa]].

[[Eros Airport]] is the busiest airport in Namibia in terms of takeoffs and landings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.airports.com.na/eros.php |title=Namibia Airports Company |access-date=9 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120904002500/http://www.airports.com.na/eros.php |archive-date=4 September 2012 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> This city airport handles approximately 150 to 200 movements per day, amounting to roughly 50,000 per year. In 2004, the airport served 141,605 passengers, the majority of which are light aircraft. Primarily, limitations such as runway length, noise, and air space congestion have kept Eros from developing into a larger airport. Most of Namibia's charter operators have Eros as their base.

===Rail===
[[File:Estación de ferrocarril, Windhoek, Namibia, 2018-08-04, DD 13.jpg|thumb|Windhoek Railway Station]]
Windhoek is [[Rail transport in Namibia|connected by rail]] to:

*[[Okahandja]] (north)
*[[Rehoboth, Namibia|Rehoboth]] (south)
*[[Gobabis]] (east)

==Geography==
[[File:Windhoek Luftaufnahme.jpg|thumb|[[Auas Mountains]]]]
[[File:Rainy season clouds outskirt of Windhoek.jpg|thumb|Rainy season]]
Expanding the town area has – apart from financial restrictions – proven to be challenging due to its geographical location. In southern, eastern and western directions, Windhoek is surrounded by rocky, mountainous areas, which make land development costly.
