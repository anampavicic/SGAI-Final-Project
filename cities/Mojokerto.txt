==Economy==
Mojokerto occupies a strategic position and role in East Java. It functions as a reliable sustaining stock of foodstuff and tourist attractions. Historically, Mojokerto is widely known as the then center of Wetan Mas Kingdom of King Airlangga (1029/1041), and of [[Majapahit|the Majapahit]] Kingdom with its Rajasa dynasty (1292–1400) and its territories exceeding Nusantara (standardized concept of Indonesian archipelagic territories).

Mojokerto has a motto of ''"Kota Budi Parinda"''

==Etymology==
The name "Mojokerto" is a local Javanese pronunciation of the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] words "Maja" and "Karta".  The word Maja is the same as that of Majapahi and originates from the word '[[Aegle marmelos|bael]] fruit' that was found at the location of the new capital of [[Majapahit|the Majapahit]] Empire.  Karta and Kerta mean 'Masterpiece', therefore Mojokerto means 'Masterpiece of Majapahit'.

==The Seven Age Anniversary Plan of Majapahit Glory==
Since four years ago, there have been several cultural fairs in East Java, lasting for a week. Some 37 districts participated. These activities have been held in alternate towns and cities such as Surabaya, Malang, Jember, and Madiun. The activities were aimed at utilizing East Java’s specific potentials either in the form of traditional arts or special foods in the framework of marketing tourist attractions of East Java. This year coinciding with the year of the Green Environment, of Tourist Visit, and of Seven-Age commemoration stipulated Mojokerto as the site for holding the cultural fair.
For this purpose local and provincial committees are and have been taking the following measures:
* To hold a symposium on the verge of the seven-age anniversary of Majapahit and to carry any book-writing concerning Majapahit
* To designate the year of Green Environment by planting rare plants in the area Majapahit remains; thirty-seven Kabupaten in East Java Province will participate on this occasion.
* To innovate Majapahit’s artifacts (archaeological remains)
* To establish facilities at tourist attractions

Various activities being arranged are as follows:
* East Java’s cultural and tourist fair reflecting the glory of Majapahit
* Archaeological Exhibition
* Seminars of archaeologists and historians
* Cultural arts and festivals
* Introduction to tourist attractions

The above-mentioned events took place from July 5 to July 15, 1993. Some foreign tourists came from China, Finland, Denmark, Malaysia and the Middle East.

==Climate==
Mojokerto has a [[tropical savanna climate]] with moderate to little rainfall from May to November and heavy to very heavy rainfall from December to April.
