===Native peoples===
Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the early 17th century, the Philadelphia area was home to the [[Lenape]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in the village of [[Treaty of Shackamaxon|Shackamaxon]]. They were also called the Delaware Indians,<ref name=josephy>Josephy 188–189</ref> and their historical territory was along the [[Delaware River]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]], western [[Long Island]], and the [[Hudson Valley|Lower Hudson Valley]].{{efn|1= Description of the Lenape peoples (Delaware nations) historic territories inside the [[divides]] of the frequently mountainous [[landforms]] flanking the [[Delaware River]]'s [[drainage basin]]. These terrains encompass from South to North and then counter-clockwise:
{{hlist
| the shores from the east-shore mouth of the river and the sea coast to Western Long Island (all of both colonial [[New Amsterdam]] and [[New Sweden]]), and
| portions of Western Connecticut up to the latitude of the Massachusetts corner of today's boundaries{{mdash }}making the eastern bounds of their influence, thence their region extended:
| westerly past the region around [[Albany, New York]] to the [[Susquehanna River]] side of the [[Catskills]], then
| southerly through the eastern [[Pocono Mountains|Poconos]] outside the rival [[Susquehannock]] lands past [[Province of Pennsylvania|Eastern Pennsylvania]] then southerly past the site of [[History of Philadelphia|Colonial Philadelphia]] past the west bank mouth of the Delaware and extending south from that point along a stretch of sea coast in northern colonial [[Delaware]].
}}

The [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]]-[[Delaware River]] system's [[Drainage basin|watershed]] divided the frequently contested hunting grounds between the rival [[Susquehannock]] peoples and the Lenape peoples, and the Catskills and Berkshires played a similar boundary role in the northern regions of their original colonial era range.}} Most Lenape were pushed out of the region during the 18th century by expanding European colonies, exacerbated by losses from intertribal conflicts.<ref name=josephy/> Lenape communities were weakened by newly introduced diseases, mainly [[smallpox]], and conflict with Europeans. The [[Iroquois]] occasionally fought the Lenape. Surviving Lenape moved west into the upper [[Ohio River]] basin. Following the [[American Revolutionary War]] and subsequent formation of an independent United States, the Lenape began moving further west. In the 1860s, the United States government sent most remaining Lenape in the [[eastern United States]] to the [[Indian Territory]] in present-day [[Oklahoma]] and surrounding territories as part of the [[Indian removal]] policy.

Europeans first entered Philadelphia and the surrounding [[Delaware Valley]] in the early 17th century. The first settlements were founded by [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch colonists]], who built [[Fort Nassau (South River)|Fort Nassau]] on the [[Delaware River]] in 1623 in what is now [[Brooklawn, New Jersey]]. The Dutch considered the entire Delaware River valley to be part of their [[New Netherland]] colony. In 1638, Swedish settlers led by renegade Dutch established the colony of [[New Sweden]] at [[Fort Christina]], located in present-day [[Wilmington, Delaware]], and quickly spread out in the valley. In 1644, New Sweden supported the [[Susquehannock]]s in their war against [[Province of Maryland|Maryland]] colonists.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jennings|first=Francis|year=1984|title=The Ambiguous Iroquois|location=New York|publisher=Norton|isbn=0-393-01719-2}}</ref> In 1648, the Dutch built [[Fort Beversreede]] on the west bank of the Delaware, south of the [[Schuylkill River]] near the present-day [[Eastwick, Philadelphia|Eastwick]] section of Philadelphia, to reassert their dominion over the area. The [[Swedes]] responded by building [[New Sweden#Forts|Fort Nya Korsholm]], or New [[Korsholm]], named after a town in [[Finland]] with a Swedish majority.

In 1655, a [[Dutch armed forces|Dutch military]] campaign led by New Netherland Director-General [[Peter Stuyvesant]] took control of the Swedish colony, ending its claim to independence. The Swedish and [[Finnish people]] settlers continued to have their own [[militia]], religion, and court, and to enjoy substantial autonomy under the Dutch. An English fleet captured the New Netherland colony in 1664, though the situation did not change substantially until 1682, when the area was included in [[William Penn]]'s charter for Pennsylvania.<ref>{{Citation |author-last1=Brookes |author-first1=Karin |author-first2=John |author-last2=Gattuso |author-first3=Lou |author-last3=Harry |author-first4=Edward |author-last4=Jardim |author-first5=Donald |author-last5=Kraybill |author-first6=Susan |author-last6=Lewis |author-first7=Dave |author-last7=Nelson |author-first8=Carol |author-last8=Turkington |editor-first=Zoë |editor-last=Ross |title=Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings |edition=Second (Updated) |year=2005 |publisher=APA Publications |pages=[https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21 21–22] |isbn=1-58573-026-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/insightguidephil00zoer/page/21 }}</ref>

In 1681, in partial repayment of a debt, [[Charles II of England]] granted Penn a [[charter]] for what would become the [[Province of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania colony]]. Despite the royal charter, Penn bought the land from the local [[Lenape]] in an effort to establish good terms with the Native Americans and ensure peace for the colony.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings |page=21}}</ref> Penn made a [[Treaty of Shackamaxon|treaty of friendship]] with Lenape chief [[Tamanend|Tammany]] under an elm tree at [[Shackamaxon]], in what is now the city's [[Fishtown, Philadelphia|Fishtown]] neighborhood.<ref name=weigley>{{Cite book

This tolerance, which exceeded that of other colonies, led to better relations with the local native tribes and fostered Philadelphia's rapid growth into America's most important city.<ref>{{Cite book

Penn planned a city on the Delaware River to serve as a port and place for government. Hoping that Philadelphia would become more like an English rural town instead of a city, Penn laid out roads on a [[grid plan]] to keep houses and businesses spread far apart with areas for gardens and [[orchard]]s.

The city's inhabitants did not follow Penn's plans, however, and instead crowded the present-day [[Port of Philadelphia]] on the Delaware River and subdivided and resold their lots.<ref>{{cite book

Historian [[Joseph Ellis]], in 2007, described the Declaration of Independence, written predominantly by [[Thomas Jefferson]], as "the most potent and consequential words in American history,"<ref name="American Creation"/> and its adoption represented a declaration of war against the [[British Army during the American Revolutionary War|British Army]], which was then the world's most powerful military force. Since the Declaration's July 4, 1776, adoption, its signing has been cited globally and repeatedly by various peoples of the world seeking independence and liberty. It also has been, since its adoption, the basis for annual celebration by Americans; in 1938, this celebration of the Declaration was formalized as [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], one of only [[Federal holidays in the United States|eleven designated U.S. federal holidays]].

After [[George Washington]]'s defeat at the [[Battle of Brandywine]] in [[Chadds Ford Township, Pennsylvania|Chadds Ford Township]], on September 11, 1777, during the [[Philadelphia campaign]], the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless and the city prepared for what was perceived to be an inevitable British attack. Because bells could easily be recast into munitions, the [[Liberty Bell]], then known as the Pennsylvania State Bell, and bells from two Philadelphia churches, [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]] and [[St. Peter's Episcopal Church (Philadelphia)|St. Peter's Church]], were hastily taken down and transported by heavily guarded wagon train out of the city. The Liberty Bell was taken to [[High German Evangelical Reformed Church|Zion German Reformed Church]] in Northampton Town, which is present-day [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]], where it was hidden under the church's floor boards for nine months from September 1777 until the British Army's departure from Philadelphia in June 1778.<ref>Nash, p. 19</ref> Two Revolutionary War battles, the [[Siege of Fort Mifflin]], fought between September 26 and November 16, 1777, and the [[Battle of Germantown]], fought on October 4, 1777, took place within Philadelphia's city limits.

In Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress adopted the [[Articles of Confederation]] on November 15, 1777, and the city later served as the meeting place for the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]], which ratified the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in Independence Hall in Philadelphia on September 17, 1787.

Philadelphia served as capital of the United States for much of the colonial and early post-colonial periods, including for a decade, from 1790 to 1800, while [[Washington, D.C.]], was being constructed and prepared to serve as the new national capital.<ref>''Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings'', pages 30–33</ref> In 1793, the largest [[1793 Philadelphia yellow fever epidemic|yellow fever epidemic]] in U.S. history killed approximately 4,000 to 5,000 people in Philadelphia, or about ten percent of the city's population at the time.<ref>{{cite web | title=Part 3: Philadelphia/The Yellow Fever Epidemic | work=Africans in America | publisher=PBS Online | year=1998 | url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3p1590.html | access-date=September 8, 2017 | archive-date=March 21, 2012 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321120827/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part3/3p1590.html | url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web

The state capital was moved from Philadelphia to [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania|Lancaster]] in 1799, then ultimately to [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] in 1812. Philadelphia remained the nation's largest city until the late 18th century. It also was the nation's financial and cultural center until ultimately being eclipsed in total population by [[New York City]] in 1790. In 1816, the city's free Black community founded the [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]], the first independent Black denomination in the country, and the first Black [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]]. The free Black community also established many schools for its children with the help of [[Quakers]]. Large-scale construction projects for new roads, [[canal]]s, and railroads made Philadelphia the first major [[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] city in the United States.

Immigrants, mostly from Ireland and Germany, settled in Philadelphia and the surrounding districts. These immigrants were largely responsible for the [[1835 Philadelphia general strike|first general strike in North America]] in 1835, in which workers in the city won the ten-hour workday. The city was a destination for thousands of Irish immigrants fleeing the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]] in the 1840s; housing for them was developed south of [[South Street (Philadelphia)|South Street]] and later occupied by succeeding immigrants.

Revitalization and [[gentrification]] of neighborhoods began in the late 1970s and continues into the 21st century with much of the development occurring in the [[Center City, Philadelphia|Center City]] and [[University City, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|University City]] neighborhoods. But this expanded a shortage of [[affordable housing]] in the city. After many manufacturers and businesses left Philadelphia or shut down, the city started attracting service businesses and began to market itself more aggressively as a tourist destination. Contemporary glass-and-granite [[List of tallest buildings in Philadelphia|skyscrapers]] were built in Center City beginning in the 1980s. Historic areas such as [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City]] and [[Society Hill]] were renovated during the reformist mayoral era of the 1950s through the 1980s, making both areas among the most desirable Center City neighborhoods. Immigrants from around the world began to enter the U.S. through Philadelphia as their gateway, leading to a reversal of the city's population decline between 1950 and 2000, during which it lost about 25 percent of its residents.<ref>''Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings'', pages 44–45</ref><ref>''A Concise History of Philadelphia'', page 78</ref>

Philadelphia's neighborhoods are divided into six large sections that surround Center City: [[North Philadelphia]], [[Northeast Philadelphia]], [[South Philadelphia]], [[Southwest Philadelphia]], [[West Philadelphia]], and [[Northwest Philadelphia]]. The city's geographic boundaries have been largely unchanged since these neighborhoods were consolidated in 1854. However, each of these large areas contains numerous neighborhoods, some of whose boundaries derive from the boroughs, townships, and other communities that constituted [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania County]] before their inclusion within the city.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Insight Guides: Philadelphia and Surroundings |page=58}}</ref>

Philadelphia's architectural history dates back to [[Colonial history of the United States|colonial]] times and includes a wide range of styles. The earliest structures were constructed with [[Log house|logs]], but brick structures were common by 1700. During the 18th century, the [[cityscape]] was dominated by [[Georgian architecture]], including [[Independence Hall]] and [[Christ Church, Philadelphia|Christ Church]].

In the first decades of the 19th century, [[Federal architecture|Federal]] and [[Greek Revival architecture]] were the dominant styles produced by Philadelphia architects such as [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe|Benjamin Latrobe]], [[William Strickland (architect)|William Strickland]], [[John Haviland]], [[John Notman]], [[Thomas Ustick Walter|Thomas Walter]], and [[Samuel Sloan (architect)|Samuel Sloan]].<ref name=Philadelphia-Page251>{{Cite book |title=Philadelphia: A 300-Year History |pages=11, 41, 174–175, 251–253}}</ref> [[Frank Furness]] is considered Philadelphia's greatest architect of the second half of the 19th century. His contemporaries included [[John McArthur Jr.]], [[Addison Hutton]], [[Wilson Eyre]], the [[Wilson Brothers & Company|Wilson Brothers]], and [[Horace Trumbauer]]. In 1871, construction began on the [[Second Empire architecture in the United States and Canada|Second Empire]]-style [[Philadelphia City Hall]]. The [[Philadelphia Historical Commission]] was created in 1955 to preserve the cultural and architectural history of the city. The commission maintains the [[Philadelphia Register of Historic Places]], adding historic buildings, structures, sites, objects and districts as it sees fit.<ref name="PNC">{{cite web |url=http://www.phila.gov/historical/ |title=Philadelphia Historical Commission |publisher=Phila.gov |access-date=April 11, 2009 |archive-date=March 3, 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303191207/http://www.phila.gov/historical/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In 1932, Philadelphia became home to the first modern [[International Style (architecture)|International Style]] skyscraper in the United States, the [[Loews Philadelphia Hotel|PSFS Building]], designed by [[George Howe (architect)|George Howe]] and [[William Lescaze]]. The {{convert|548|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} City Hall remained the tallest building in the city until 1987 when [[Liberty Place#One Liberty Place|One Liberty Place]] was completed. Numerous glass and granite skyscrapers were built in Center City beginning in the late 1980s. In 2007, the [[Comcast Center]] surpassed One Liberty Place to become the city's tallest building. The [[Comcast Technology Center]] was completed in 2018, reaching a height of {{convert|1121|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, as the [[List of tallest buildings in the United States|tallest building in the United States]] outside of [[Manhattan]] and Chicago.<ref name=Comcast2>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitphilly.com/articles/philadelphia/the-comcast-innovation-and-technology-center/|title=Philadelphia's Newest Skyscraper: The Comcast Innovation and Technology Center|publisher=Visit Philadelphia|access-date=April 3, 2015|archive-date=March 17, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150317221032/http://www.visitphilly.com/articles/philadelphia/the-comcast-innovation-and-technology-center/|url-status=live}}</ref>

For much of Philadelphia's history, the typical home has been the [[Terraced house|row house]]. The row house was introduced to the United States via Philadelphia in the early 19th century and, for a time, row houses built elsewhere in the United States were known as "Philadelphia rows".<ref name=Philadelphia-Page251/> A variety of row houses are found throughout the city, from Federal-style continuous blocks in [[Old City, Philadelphia|Old City]] and [[Society Hill]] to Victorian-style homes in [[North Philadelphia]] to twin row houses in [[West Philadelphia]]. While newer homes have been built recently, much of the housing dates to the 18th, 19th, and early 20th centuries, which has created problems such as [[urban decay]] and vacant lots. Some neighborhoods, including [[Northern Liberties, Philadelphia|Northern Liberties]] and Society Hill, have been rehabilitated through [[gentrification]].<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Aitken |first=Joanne |title=Breaking Ground |journal=Philadelphia City Paper |date=June 3–19, 2004 |url=http://www.citypaper.net/articles/2004-06-03/cityspace.shtml |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160113222258/http://citypaper.net/articles/2004-06-03/cityspace.shtml |archive-date=January 13, 2016 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Mark Alan Hughes |title=Dirt Into Dollars; Converting Vacant Land Into Valuable Development |url=http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2000/06/summer-metropolitanpolicy-hughes |date=June 1, 2000 |access-date=December 24, 2013 |archive-date=December 25, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225175538/http://www.brookings.edu/research/articles/2000/06/summer-metropolitanpolicy-hughes |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Philadelphia}}
In a 2014 study by the [[Pew Research Center]], 68% of the population of the city identified themselves as [[Christians|Christian]].<ref>[http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/29/major-u-s-metropolitan-areas-differ-in-their-religious-profiles/ Major U.S. metropolitan areas differ in their religious profiles] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210308152313/https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2015/07/29/major-u-s-metropolitan-areas-differ-in-their-religious-profiles/ |date=March 8, 2021 }}, Pew Research Center</ref> Approximately 41% of Christians in the city and area professed attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered [[Protestant]], while 26% professed [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] beliefs.

The [[Protestantism|Protestant]] Christian community in Philadelphia is dominated by [[Mainline Protestant|mainline Protestant denominations]] including the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], [[United Church of Christ]], the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church in the United States]], [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] and [[American Baptist Churches USA]]. One of the most prominent mainline Protestant jurisdictions is the [[Episcopal Diocese of Pennsylvania]]. The [[African Methodist Episcopal Church]] was established in Philadelphia. Historically, the city has strong connections to the [[Quakers]], [[Unitarian Universalism]], and the [[Ethical movement|Ethical Culture movement]], all of which continue to be represented in the city. The Quaker [[Friends General Conference]] is based in Philadelphia. Evangelical Protestants making up less than 15% of the population were also prevalent.

Evangelical Protestant bodies included the [[Anglican Church in North America]], [[Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod|Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod]], [[Presbyterian Church in America]], and [[National Baptist Convention of America International, Inc.|National Baptist Convention of America]]. The Catholic community is primarily served by the [[Latin Church|Latin]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia|Catholic Archdiocese of Philadelphia]], the [[Ukrainian Catholic Archeparchy of Philadelphia]], and the [[Syro-Malankara Catholic Eparchy of the United States of America and Canada]], though some [[Independent Catholicism|independent Catholic churches]] exist throughout Philadelphia and its suburbs. The Latin Church-based jurisdiction is headquartered in the city, and its see is the [[Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul (Philadelphia)|Cathedral Basilica of Saints Peter and Paul]]. The Ukrainian Catholic jurisdiction is headquartered in Philadelphia, and is seated at the [[Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception (Philadelphia)|Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception]].

Less than 1% of Philadelphia's Christians were [[Mormons]]. The remainder of the Christian demographic is spread among smaller Protestant denominations and the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern]] and [[Oriental Orthodox Churches|Oriental Orthodox]] among others. The [[Orthodox Church in America Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania|Diocese of Eastern Pennsylvania]] ([[Orthodox Church in America]]) and [[Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America]] ([[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Ecumenical Patriarchate]]) divide the Eastern Orthodox in Philadelphia. The [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] [[St. Andrew's Cathedral, Philadelphia|St. Andrew's Cathedral]] is in the city.
The same study says that other religions collectively compose about 8% of the population, including [[Judaism]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Sikhism]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ |title=America's Changing Religious Landscape |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion & Public Life |date=May 12, 2015 |access-date=July 30, 2015 |archive-date=January 7, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190107064929/http://www.pewforum.org/2015/05/12/americas-changing-religious-landscape/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Philadelphia has the fifth-largest [[Muslim]] population among U.S. cities.<ref>Overcoming the World Missions Crisis: Thinking Strategically to Reach the World, Russell Penney, page 110, 2001</ref> The remaining 24% claimed [[Irreligion|no religious affiliation]].
