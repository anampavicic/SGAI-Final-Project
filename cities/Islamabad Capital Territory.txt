The '''Islamabad Capital Territory''' ('''ICT'''; {{langx|ur|{{Nastaliq|وفاقی دارالحکومت}}|translit=Vafāqī Dār-alhakūmat}}) is the only [[Administrative units of Pakistan|federal territory]] of [[Pakistan]] that is centred around [[Islamabad]], the capital of Pakistan, located on the northern edge of the [[Pothohar Plateau]], at the foot of the [[Margalla Hills]], in the northwestern area of the [[Punjab|Punjab region]]. The territory shares borders with the province of [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] in the west and with the province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]{{efn|Islamabad Capital Territory is, geographically, a part of the Punjab region but, administratively, separate from the province of Punjab since 1967.}} in the remaining directions. It covers an area of {{convert|906.5|km2|mi2|abbr=out}} and, according to [[2023 Pakistani census|2023 census]], has a population of over 2.3 million.<ref name="2023 Census" />

The area was separated from [[Rawalpindi District]] in 1967 to form a separate territory administered by the [[Government of Pakistan|federal government]]. The territory is represented in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] by [[NA-52 (Islamabad-I)|NA-52]], [[NA-53 (Islamabad-II)|NA-53]], and [[NA-54 (Islamabad-III)|NA-54]] constituencies and by four seats in [[Senate of Pakistan|the Senate]].

==History==

In 1960, land was transferred from [[Rawalpindi District]] of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province to replace [[Karachi Federal Capital Territory]] and establish Pakistan's new capital. According to the 1960s master plan, the Capital Territory included [[Rawalpindi]], and was to be composed of the following parts:<ref name=Bharne>{{cite book|editor=Vinayak Bharne|title=The Emerging Asian City: Concomitant Urbanities and Urbanisms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8Xj7pHu1jEC|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-52597-8|page=131}}</ref>

<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Islamabaw.jpg|thumb|left|alt=|[[The Centaurus]] (pictured during construction) is a [[multimillion]] dollar project in Islamabad]] -->

The main administrative authority of the city is [[ICT Administration|Islamabad Capital Territory Administration]] with some help from [[Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation|Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad]] and Capital Development Authority (CDA), which oversees the planning, development, construction, and administration of the city. Islamabad Capital Territory is divided into eight zones: Administrative Zone, Commercial District, Educational Sector, Industrial Sector, Diplomatic Enclave, Residential Areas, Rural Areas and Green Area.

Islamabad city is divided into five major zones: Zone I, Zone II, Zone III, Zone IV, and Zone V. Out of these, Zone IV is the largest in area. All sectors of Ghouri Town (1, 2, 3, VIP, 5, 4-A, 4-B, 4-C, 5-A, 5-B and sector 7) are located in this zone. Zone I consists mainly of all the developed residential sectors, while Zone II consists of the under-developed residential sectors. Each residential sector is identified by a letter of the alphabet and a number, and covers an area of approximately 4 square kilometres. The sectors are lettered from A to I, and each sector is divided into four numbered sub-sectors.<ref name="S.
