'''Ventura''', officially named '''San Buenaventura''' (Spanish for "[[Saint Bonaventure]]"),<ref>Erwin G. Gudde, ''California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographical Names'', 4th ed., rev. and enlarged by William Bright (University of California Press, 1998), p. 410.</ref> is a city in and the [[county seat]] of [[Ventura County, California]], United States. It is a coastal city located northwest of [[Los Angeles]]. The population was 110,763 at the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://datausa.io/profile/geo/san-buenaventura-(ventura)-ca/|title=San Buenaventura (Ventura), CA|work=Data USA|access-date=November 29, 2017}}</ref> Ventura is a popular tourist destination, owing to its historic landmarks, beaches, and resorts.

Ventura has been inhabited by different peoples, including the Chumash Native Americans, for at least 10,000 years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cityofventura.ca.gov/594/About-Ventura |title= City of Ventura - About Ventura |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=<!--Not stated--> |website= City of Ventura official website |publisher= © 2006-2023 Ventura, CA |access-date= January 6, 2023}}</ref> With the arrival of Spanish missionaries in 1782, [[Mission San Buenaventura]] was established by [[Junípero Serra]], giving the city its name.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ventura |title= Ventura, CA |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=<!--Not stated--> |website= Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher= |access-date= January 6, 2023}}</ref> Following the [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|Mexican secularization of the Californian missions]], San Buenaventura was granted by Governor [[Pío Pico]] to [[Don (honorific)|Don]] José de Arnaz as [[Rancho Ex-Mission San Buenaventura]] and a small community arose. Following the American [[Conquest of California]], San Buenaventura was eventually incorporated as a city in 1866. The 1920s brought a major oil boom which significantly developed and expanded Ventura, a growth that continued with the [[post–World War II economic expansion]].

Following the American [[Conquest of California]] in the [[Mexican–American War]], California became a U.S. territory in 1848 and a U.S. state in 1850. After the [[American Civil War]], settlers came to the area, buying land from the Mexicans, or simply as [[squatter]]s. Vast holdings were later acquired by Easterners, including railroad magnate [[Thomas A. Scott]]. He sent [[Thomas R. Bard]] to handle Scott's property.

Ventura had a flourishing Chinese settlement in the early 1880s. The largest concentration of activity, known as China Alley, was just across Main Street from the Mission San Buenaventura.<ref>{{cite web|title=Point of Interest Number: 91 {{!}} Historic Name: China Alley Historic Area|url=https://map.cityofventura.net/docs/historic/91.pdf|work=City of San Buenaventura Historic Landmarks, Districts, and Points of Interest|publisher=City of Ventura}}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:VENTURA HARBOR 2020.jpg|thumb|left|View of [[Ventura Harbor]]]]
[[File:-Ventura California Aerial Photo Don Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Ventura]]
Ventura is located northwest of [[Los Angeles]] on the [[California coast]]. The western portion of the city stretches north along the [[Ventura River]] which is characterized by a narrow valley with steeply sloped areas along both sides. The steep slopes of the Ventura foothills abut the northern portion of the community. Much of the eastern portion is on a relatively flat [[Alluvial plain|alluvial coastal plain]] lying along the western edge of the [[Oxnard Plain]].
