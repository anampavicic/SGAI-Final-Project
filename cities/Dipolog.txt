'''Dipolog''' ({{IPA|tl|diˈpɔʔlɔg|}}), officially the '''City of Dipolog''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Dipolog}}; [[Subanen languages|Subanen]]: ''Gembagel G'benwa Dipuleg/Bagbenwa Dipuleg''; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Dipolog}}), is a 3rd class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] and capital of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Zamboanga del Norte]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 138,141 people making it the most populous in the province.{{PH census|current}}

Geographically, the city is surrounded by rolling hills to the southeast and the [[Sulu Sea]] to the north. Dipolog is known for its wild orchids and its sardine industry which stems from the rich fishing area off its shores. It is known as the "Gateway to Western Mindanao" through the [[SRNH|Western Nautical Highway]]<ref name="SRNH">{{cite web|title=The Philippine Nautical Highway|url=http://www.gov.ph/forum/thread.asp?rootID=78558&catID=5 |publisher=Government of the Philippines|access-date=October 14, 2007 |url-status=dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20080118125803/http://www.gov.ph/forum/thread.asp?rootID=78558&catID=5 |archive-date = January 18, 2008}}</ref>

Dipolog can be reached by plane via [[Dipolog Airport]] or by ferry at the [[Port of Dipolog|Galas Port]] in Barangay Galas or at nearby [[Port of Dapitan|Pulauan Port]]<ref name="Pulauan Dapitan">{{cite web|title=Pulauan Dapitan|url=http://www.news.davaoseo.org/destinations/pulauan-dapitan/|access-date=November 12, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141112111356/http://www.news.davaoseo.org/destinations/pulauan-dapitan/|archive-date=November 12, 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> in [[Dapitan]]. The development of the Port of Dipolog, a [[roll-on/roll-off]] facility at Barangay Galas, will allow for the eventual transfer of the service to Dipolog while retaining inter-island operations at Pulauan, which is a base port.

A popular city attraction is the [[foreshore]] [[Dipolog Boulevard]] which, though still in its second phase of construction, has become a popular haven for exercise and leisure. It is also the site for various celebrations and festivals in the city. In the third phase of the project, the length of the boulevard will be extended to reach the seaport in Barangay Galas.

==History==

===Spanish regime===
The town appeared in the 1734 [[Murillo Velarde map]] as '''''Diporog'''''.

Earliest recorded political history of Dipolog started in 1834 with the re-organization of Spanish Provincial Government of Misamis. At that time, ''Tulwanan's'' political territory was still part of the Municipality of Dapitan with Don Domingo Ruiz, a native, as its ''capitán'' or town executive.
Sometime that year, a Spanish Recollect missionary arrived in Tulwanan looking for its [[barrio]] executive or local chieftain. Upon meeting a native, the missionary asked; '''"¿Dónde está el capitán?"''' or ''"Where is the captain?"''. The native understanding only the word "capitán" pointed to the west and said in Subanen '''Di-pag''', meaning ''across the river''. Guided by his servant, a Tagalog boy named Antonio Subido, the missionary proceeded down river and upon reaching the Boholano settlement, named the place "Dipag".

Technically, Dipag and Tulwanan were two different settlements at that time with the former composed of Boholano natives and the latter mostly of Subanen ancestry. When the friar returned to Dapitan, he identified the location of the larger Boholano settlement as Dipag but was not officially written. Frequent conversations by the Spaniards pronounced it in Spanish accent ''Dipolog'' which was eventually adopted by the natives. The final political survey surprisingly added the letter 'L' written on it after officially becoming a barrio of Dapitan. From that time Tulwanan's political identity ceased to exist.
By the 12th century the Subanen settlers had colonized most of what is now [[Zamboanga Peninsula]] region. It was customary for tribes to establish their settlements at the mouth of large river systems due to the abundant food supply. However, due to frequent raids from seafaring Chinese [[Pirate|pirates]], they decided to move their settlements inland.

In the 14th century, '''Tulwanan''' was established 6 kilometers inland, adjoining the river near the present day ''barangay'' center of ''Lugdungan''.

In the 15th century, settlers from neighboring [[Negros Island|Negros]] and [[Bohol]] islands established coastline settlements in Mindanao but suffered the same raids by Chinese pirates, prompting them to also move their settlements away from the coastline. They established another settlement in what is now called Sianib, a ''barangay'' of present-day [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]] town, some twenty kilometers from the coast at Barrio Gulayon(Barangay Gulayon).

It was only in 1563 that the first recorded Visayan settlement of some 800 families from Bohol, led by the chieftain Datu Pagbuaya, landed in [[Mindanao]] and established a coastal settlement in what is now called [[Dapitan]]. This settlement was strong enough to repel the Chinese pirates of the Sulu Sea. As a result, Dapitan Bay was scene of many bloody conflicts between Pagbuaya's men and Chinese pirates.

===Mindanao's first Christian settlement===
In 1565, Don [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] who was accompanied by famed navigator Fr. [[Andrés de Urdaneta]], an Augustinian friar, visited the Boholano chieftain Datu Pagbuaya on the invitation of [[Datu Sikatuna]]. There they found the place of Datu Pagbuaya to be a thriving settlement. In his chronicle, Fr. Urdaneta named the place Daquepitan. [[Peter Kaerius]] (Pieter van den Keere) identified the location as ''Dapito'' in his cartographic map of 1598. It was later identified as "Dapite" in [[Robert Dudley (explorer)|Robert Dudley]]'s map of 1646. Other names ascribed to the location include "Dapyto" in Sanson's map of 1652 and "Dapitan" which can be found in [[Herman Moll|Moll]]'s map of the East Indies, 1729 and in Murillo Velarde's map of 1734. After [[Miguel López de Legazpi|Legazpi]]'s visit, the [[Christianization]] of Mindanao was officially initiated by the Augustinian friars who arrived with him.

In 1581, members of The [[Society of Jesus]] came to the Philippines for the purpose of evangelization. When the country was divided among four [[Religious order#Christian tradition|religious orders]] in 1598, the Jesuits were given the Diocese of Cebu which covered the Visayas and Mindanao. Thus Dapitan came to be under the jurisdiction of the courageous men of St. Ignatius and it was Father Pascual de Acuña S.J. who started the Jesuit mission there.

In 1609, the squadron of Juan Juarez Gallinato S.J. defeated the Manguindanau Muslims in a ferocious battle near Dapitan.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dipolog.us/history.htm|title=THE DIOCESE: RETROSPECTION - INTROSPECTION|publisher=Old Website of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dipolog|access-date=May 20, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404221351/http://www.dipolog.us/history.htm|archive-date=April 4, 2007|url-status=dead }}</ref>

Also in 1609, a permanent Dapitan mission was founded and thereafter headed by a Jesuit missionary, Father Pedro Gutierrez, marking Dapitan as the Center of Evangelization in Mindanao.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.dipolog.us/ |title=HOME|publisher=Old Website of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Dipolog|access-date=May 20, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404221438/http://www.dipolog.us/ |archive-date=April 4, 2007|url-status=dead }}</ref> Mission stations were subsequently established later by the Jesuits in Zamboanga, [[Iligan]], [[History of Basilan|Basilan]] and [[Butuan]]. Outside of these areas, however, the whole of Mindanao remained untouched by the Spanish Cross.

[[File:STA. CRUZ - (Punta Corro).JPG|thumb|upright|left|The Santa Cruz Marker (Punta Corro) is the spot where migrating Boholanos from the Visayas landed and established settlement.]]
By the 18th century, with the [[Armada Española#The roots of the Spanish Navy (15th century)|Spanish Naval Fleet]] anchored at Dapitan Bay, much of the piracy&mdash;now conducted mainly by [[Moro people|moro]] bandits&mdash;was under control within the [[Sulu Sea]]. Settlement in coastal areas resumed with new settlers from Negros and Bohol eventually settling in Isab, and Nipaan. The largest settlement, however, was made at the mouth of the Dipolog river by the Boholanos who were not associated with Pagbuaya.

From Ruiz, civil administration changed hands in stable succession, with Martino Belarmino, who was popular by the name Maglinte. Francisco Magallanes, Victorio Gobune; another man whose name history record had as Toribio had his chance, followed by Venancio Narvaez, Francisco Orbita, Bautista Narvaez, Martencio Yebes and Sabino Bengua.

By 1889, administrative designations reverted to ''Capitanes'', and those appointed were Martin Fernandez, Tomas Narvacan, Eustaquio Cajocon, Simplicio Lacaya, Basilio Tabiliran, Maximiano Ruiz and Bruno Ordinaria in 1898.

By February 1894, the Catholic Chapel constructed by the Jesuits was renovated for the first time, on an altar designed by Dr. [[José Rizal]] to which now stands the [[Dipolog Cathedral|Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary Cathedral]].

By 1896, the friars established Dipolog as a regular parish and installed Father Esteban Yepes its first administrator in 1897.

===American regime===
After the transfer of Spanish [[sovereignty]] to the United States in 1897, the U.S. occupation forces renamed the ''Capitan'' to Presidente Local, with administrative support from a Vice Presidente Local, a Delegado de Justicia and a Delegado de Policia.
Martin Fernandez was appointed Presidente Local in the year 1900, followed by Diosdado Mercado, Gaudencio Zorilla and Isidro Patangan as Presidente Municipal between 1901 and March 1904.

By 1900, Dipolog was a thriving commercial community with new settlers arriving from the island of [[Cebu]], outgrowing its principal town of Dapitan which exclusively remained part of Pagbuaya's clan.

By 1910, John Helper, who was previously appointed Secretary of Zamboanga Province, visited Dipolog for two days and conversed with its [[principalía]] and members of the ''Centro Catolico de Dipolog''. He was asked later of the possibility of converting the [[barrio|community]] to an independent Municipality.

By 1912, Gov. [[John J. Pershing]] of the Department of Mindanao and Sulu decreed the separation of Dipolog from Dapitan and reorganize as a municipality again.

By July 1, 1913, Gov. John J. Pershing declared Dipolog as a Municipality. General Pershing also appointed '''Pascual Tan Martinez''', who was appointed the Municipal President of Dapitan since 1910, as its first Municipal Mayor.

The first public school teachers of Dipolog, during this time, came also from Bohol, particularly [[Maribojoc, Bohol|Maribojoc]] and other towns. Most were only elementary graduates. But they were well-educated by the American soldier-teachers in Bohol. One of them was a certain Felisa Ruaya who taught at the American-established schools in Dipolog. She lived first near the beach in Punta Corro. Then she married an Adriatico, a native of Polanco. Because the inhabitants converted to Christianity, it cannot be determined whether or not the residents were of Subanen heritage. Felisa Ruaya was the mother of former Zamboanga del Norte vice governor Concordio Ruaya Adriatico.

===Japanese regime and World War II===
[[File:Dipolog_field_1945.jpg|thumb|upright|Aerial view of Dipolog Field in 1945.]]
Governor [[Matias Ranillo Sr.|Matias Castillon Ranillo Sr.]] noticed that the waters at Punta Coro wharf were choppy for ships to anchor.  Governor Ranillo was determined to provide an alternative access to southern Zamboanga peninsula.  Governor Ranillo's jurisdiction was then the entire Zamboanga peninsula prior to its division between del Norte and del Sur.  During Governor Ranillo's term, aviation was a young technology but he made sure that an airfield was established in Dipolog.

He was elected Governor in 1937 and re-elected in 1940 but his term was cut short when Philippine President [[Manuel L. Quezon]] urged him to run as the lone Assemblyman of Zamboanga peninsula.  President Quezon fondly called him "El Gallo Escondido de Malacanang".  In November 1941, he was elected as Assemblyman but one week before his scheduled departure for Manila, World War II broke out. On October 30, 1944, upon the request of the guerrillas, he mobilized the able-bodied men of Dipolog and Home guards who cheerfully volunteered to clear the airfield of grass and shrubs.

In 1942, when the Japanese invaded the Philippines, [[Zamboanga (province)|Zamboanga]] acting Governor Felipe B. Azcuna moved the capital from [[Zamboanga City]] to Dipolog. On March 8, 1945, on Dipolog airfield, the first American invasion of Zamboanga peninsula took place. The successful landing at Dipolog airfield established a base for the subsequent recapture of Japanese-held San Roque airfield near [[Zamboanga City]], followed by Sanga Sanga in [[Sulu]], and from there to Borneo and the East Indies. After the defeat of the American-Filipino forces in [[Corregidor]], most of the province went under Japanese control. This designation lasted until June 16, 1948, when the capital was transferred from Dipolog to [[Molave, Zamboanga del Sur]] through Republic Act No. 286 signed by President [[Elpidio Quirino]].

===Philippine Republic and Cityhood===

Certain portions of Dipolog were organized into separate municipalities of [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]] and [[Piñan|New Piñan]], by virtue of ''[[Executive order (Philippines)|Executive Order]] No. 467'' signed by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Elpidio Quirino]] on August 22, 1951.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1951/08/22/executive-order-no-467-s-1951/ |title=Executive Order No. 467, s. 1951 |date=August 22, 1951 |website=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)]] |publisher=[[Government of the Philippines]] |access-date=March 20, 2023}}</ref>

On June 6, 1952, Zamboanga province is separated into two provinces of [[Zamboanga del Norte]] and [[Zamboanga del Sur]] through ''[[Republic Act]] (RA) No. 711''. Dipolog became the capital of Zamboanga del Norte upon creation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Republic Act No. 711 |url=http://www.chanrobles.com/republicacts/republicactno711.html |work=Chan Robles Virtual Law Library |access-date=September 28, 2013}}</ref>

On June 21, 1969, through the effort of former congressman Alberto Q. Ubay, President [[Ferdinand Marcos]] signed into law ''RA No. 5520'', making Dipolog a chartered city effective January 1, 1970.<ref name="RA5520">{{cite web |website=The LawPhil Project |title=Republic Act No. 5520 |url=https://lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1969/ra_5520_1969.html|publisher=Arellano Law Foundation, Inc. |access-date=June 4, 2020}}</ref> The date is both significant and historic as that coincided with the Apollo 11 launching which carried the first men to the moon on June 21, 1969.
Mayor Felicisimo Herrera was made the last Municipal Mayor (1963–1970) and the first City Mayor of Dipolog (1970–1978). On March 8, 1982, the [[Dipolog City Council|Sangguniang Panlungsod]] adopted the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOBPnJSHipc Dipolog City March] composed by Mrs. Antonina O. Romano as the city's official song.

Dipolog is known to be as the "Gateway to Western Mindanao" it is situated in the Northwestern part of the Province of [[Zamboanga del Norte]]. It is bounded on the north by [[Dapitan]], on the east by the Municipalities of [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]] and [[Piñan, Zamboanga del Norte|Piñan]], on the south by the Municipality of [[Sergio Osmeña Sr., Zamboanga del Norte|Sergio Osmeña Sr.]] and on the west by the Municipality of [[Katipunan, Zamboanga del Norte|Katipunan]].

Its land area in 1914 covered an approximate land area of 248,587 hectares under Act No. 302 of the Philippine Islands. It was substantially reduced in 1951 to the current 13,628 hectares, after two [[barrio]]s of Dipolog were converted into Municipalities of [[Polanco, Zamboanga del Norte|Polanco]], and [[Piñan, Zamboanga del Norte|Piñan]] under Executive Order of the President No. 467, dated August 22, 1951.

===Barangays===
[[File:Dipolog barangay map.png|thumb|right|Map of Dipolog with barangay partitions.]]

The city is now one of the major options for local investors from [[Cebu]], [[Dumaguete]], [[Cagayan de Oro]] and [[Davao City|Davao]] and for foreign nationalities from [[India]] and [[China]] investing in retail, tourism, services, manufacturing, trade, and wholesale. It is also abundant with natural resources in terms of agriculture with fishpond areas and fishing grounds; fish production with approximately 56 fish species being produced, as well as livestock production such as carabao, cattle, horse, goat and pig.

Potential investment areas range from agri-based processing such as [[activated carbon|activated charcoal]], desiccated coconut, broiler contract growing, livestock raising, cattle fattening; construction, furniture, marble, low-cost housing projects, feed mill; food processing or packaging such as meat and fish processing, mango processing and packaging.

In 2006, a study by the National Statistics Coordination Board (NSCB) found Dipolog to be the wealthiest city ''per capita'' in the [[Zamboanga Peninsula]]. Within Dipolog, 23.15% of the population was estimated to be living below the poverty line (households with a per capita expenditure of under $1 a day).

Dipolog was previously known as '''Tulwanan''', in native language, literally meaning a ''settlement by the river''. Its earliest settlers all belonged to the ''Subanen Tribe'' called ''Subanon'' or river people with established religion founded in [[animism]]. These descended from the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] peoples who roamed [[Mindanao]] and Southeast Asia via [[land bridge]]s as early as 30,000 years ago<ref name="healthalert">{{cite web |title=A Brief History of the Philippines from a Filipino Perspective |url=http://www.tribo.org/history/history3.html |publisher=Health Action Information Network |access-date=April 21, 2007 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070518035713/http://www.tribo.org/history/history3.html |archive-date=May 18, 2007 }}</ref> Later migrations of other tribes were made by water and took place over several thousand years.
