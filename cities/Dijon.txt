The city has retained varied [[architectural style]]s from many of the main periods of the past millennium, including Capetian, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]], and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]. Many still-inhabited townhouses in the city's central district date from the 18th century and earlier. Dijon's architecture is distinguished by, among other things, ''[[toits bourguignons]]'' (Burgundian polychrome roofs) made of glazed [[terracotta]] tiles of various colours arranged in geometric patterns.

Dijon holds an International and Gastronomic Fair every year in the northern-hemisphere autumn. Dijon also hosts every three years the international flower show ''[[Florissimo]]''. Dijon has become famous for [[Dijon mustard]], which originated in 1856, when Jean Naigeon of Dijon substituted [[verjuice]], the acidic "green" juice of not-quite-ripe grapes, for vinegar in the traditional mustard recipe. Dijon is a [[green city]] with an important tertiary sector, as well as a regional economic centre with a diversified fabric, a traditional food-processing center (Dijon ''crême de cassis'' and kir, gingerbread, Lanvin chocolate...) and a renowned pharmaceutical sector.

On 4 July 2015, UNESCO registered the historical centre of the city as a [[List of World Heritage Sites in France|World Heritage site]], as one of the components of the "[[Climats, terroirs of Burgundy]]" site, because of its historical importance in regulating the system of wine production in Burgundy.<ref name="Unesco.org">{{Cite web |last=mondial |first=UNESCO Centre du patrimoine |title=Les Climats du vignoble de Bourgogne |url=https://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/1425/ |access-date=2023-04-13 |website=UNESCO Centre du patrimoine mondial |language=fr |archive-date=26 April 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200426213600/https://whc.unesco.org/fr/list/1425/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Dijon}}
The earliest archaeological finds within the city limits of Dijon date to the [[Neolithic]] period. Dijon later became a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlement called ''Divio'', which may mean ''sacred fountain'', located on the road from [[Lyon]] to Paris. [[Benignus of Dijon|Saint Benignus]], the city's apocryphal [[patron saint]], is said to have introduced Christianity to the area before being martyred.<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02479c.htm  Kirsch, Johann Peter. "St. Benignus of Dijon." The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 24 May 2018</ref> 

This province was home to the [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]] from the early 11th until the late 15th century, and Dijon was a place of tremendous wealth and power and one of the great European centres of art, learning, and science. The [[Duchy of Burgundy]] was key in the transformation of medieval times toward [[early modern Europe]]. The [[Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy]] now houses the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) and the [[musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon|musée des Beaux-Arts]] (Museum of Fine Arts).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-10-01 |title=Musée des beaux-arts de Dijon at DIJON |url=https://en.destinationdijon.com/cultural-heritage/musee-des-beaux-arts-de-dijon/ |access-date=2023-05-23 |website=Tourist Office Dijon Métropole |language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1513, Swiss and Imperial armies invaded Burgundy and besieged Dijon, which was defended by the governor of the province, [[Louis II de la Trémoille]]. The siege was extremely violent, but the town succeeded in resisting the invaders. After long negotiations, Louis II de la Trémoille managed to persuade the Swiss and the Imperial armies to withdraw their troops and also to return three hostages who were being held in Switzerland. During the siege, the population called on the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] for help and saw the town's successful resistance and the subsequent withdrawal of the invaders as a miracle. For those reasons, in the years following the siege, the inhabitants of Dijon began to venerate [[Church of Notre-Dame of Dijon#Statue of Notre-Dame de Bon-Espoir|Notre-Dame de Bon-Espoir]] (Our Lady of Good Hope). Although a few areas of the town were destroyed, there are nearly no signs of the siege of 1513 visible today. However, [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon|Dijon's museum of fine arts]] has a large tapestry depicting this episode in the town's history: it shows the town before all subsequent destruction (particularly that which occurred during the French Revolution) and is an example of 16th-century art.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://beaux-arts.dijon.fr/sites/default/files/Collections/pdf/flandre_la_tapisserie_du_siege_de_dijon_apres_1513_interactif.pdf |title=Dijon 1513|publisher= Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon|access-date=2 November 2024}}</ref>

A system of purified water for the citizens of Dijon was constructed by [[Henry Darcy]] a quarter-century before Paris was so supplied.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Freeze|first1=R. Allan|title=Henry Darcy and the Fountains of Dijon|journal=Ground Water|volume=32|issue=1|year=1994|pages=23–30|issn=0017-467X|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6584.1994.tb00606.x|bibcode=1994GrWat..32...23F }}</ref>

Dijon was also occupied by anti-Napoleonic coalitions in 1814, by the Prussian army in 1870–71, and by [[Nazi Germany]] beginning in June 1940, during WWII, when it was bombed by US Air Force B-17 Flying Fortresses,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fold3.com/document/49492859/ |title=Bombing of Dijon, France |publisher=U.S. Air Force |access-date=19 January 2009 |archive-date=2 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202094052/http://www.fold3.com/document/49492859/ |url-status=live }}</ref> before the liberation of Dijon by the [[French Army]] and the French Resistance, 11 September 1944.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.tracesofwar.com/sights/60289/Liberation-Memorial-Dijon.htm |title=Liberation Memorial Dijon|publisher=Traces of War| access-date=2 November 2024}}</ref>

==Geography==
Dijon is situated at the heart of a plain drained by two small converging rivers: the [[Suzon (river)|Suzon]], which crosses it mostly underground from north to south, and the [[Ouche]], on the southern side of town. Farther south is the ''côte'', or hillside, of vineyards that gives the department its name. Dijon lies {{convert|310|km|0|abbr=on}} southeast of Paris, {{convert|190|km|0|abbr=on}} northwest of [[Geneva]], and {{convert|190|km|0|abbr=on}} north of [[Lyon]].

===Climate===
Dijon features an [[oceanic climate]] (Cfb) with [[continentality|continental influence]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. The city is highly influenced by its position far inland in Northeastern France. Thus, winters are cool to cold with moderate frosts at night and thawing conditions during the day while summers are warm to hot and humid with frequent thunderstorms.

Dijon has a large number of churches, including [[Church of Notre-Dame of Dijon|Notre Dame de Dijon]], St. Philibert, St. Michel, and [[Dijon Cathedral]], dedicated to the apocryphal Saint Benignus, the [[crypt]] of which is over 1,000 years old. The city has retained varied [[architectural style]]s from many of the main periods of the past millennium, including Capetian, [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]]. Many still-inhabited townhouses in the city's central district date from the 18th century and earlier. Dijon architecture is distinguished by, among other things, ''[[toits bourguignons]]'' (Burgundian polychrome roofs) made of glazed [[terracotta]] tiles of various colours arranged in geometric patterns.

[[File:F09.St-Bénigne.Dijion.0078.JPG|thumb|View of the spire of Dijon Cathedral, showing roofs with polychrome tiles.]]

Dijon was largely spared the destruction of wars such as the 1870 [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the Second World War, despite the city being occupied. Therefore, many of the old buildings such as the [[Timber framing|half-timbered]] houses dating from the 12th to the 15th centuries (found mainly in the city's core district) are undamaged, at least by organized violence.

Dijon is home to many museums, including the [[Musée des Beaux-Arts de Dijon]] in part of the Ducal Palace (see below). It contains, among other things, ducal kitchens dating back to the mid-15th century, and a substantial collection of primarily European art, from Roman times through the present.

Among the more popular sights is the [[Palace of the Dukes of Burgundy|Ducal Palace]], the ''Palais des Ducs et des États de Bourgogne'' or "Palace of the Dukes and the States of Burgundy" ({{Coord|47|19|19|N|5|2|29|E}}), which includes one of only a few remaining examples of Capetian period architecture in the region. Many art interested visitors flock to the ''Puits de Moïse'' or [[Well of Moses]], a monumental sculpture by [[Claus Sluter]].
 
The church of Notre Dame is famous for both its art and architecture. Popular legend has it that one of its stone relief sculptures, an owl (''la chouette'') is a [[wikt:talisman|good-luck charm]]: visitors to the church touch the owl with their left hands to make a wish. (The current carving was restored after it was damaged by vandalism in the night of 5 and 6 January 2001).

The Grand Théâtre de Dijon, built in 1828 and one of the main performing venues of the [[Opéra de Dijon]], was declared a {{Lang|fr|[[monument historique]]}} of France in 1975. It was designed by the Dijon-born architect [[Jacques Cellerier]] (1742–1814) in the [[Neoclassical architecture|Neo-classical]] style with an interior modelled on Italian opera houses.<ref>{{Base Mérimée|PA00112435|Théâtre, Dijon}}.</ref>

==Transport==
=== Roads ===
Dijon is located approximately {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of Paris, about three hours by car along the [[A38 autoroute|A38]] and [[A6 autoroute|A6]] motorways. The [[A31 autoroute|A31]] provides connections to Nancy, Lille and Lyon. The [[A39 autoroute|A39]] connects Dijon with [[Bourg-en-Bresse]] and Geneva, the [[A36 autoroute|A36]] with [[Besançon]], [[Mulhouse]] and [[Basel]].

=== Water transport ===
The [[Canal de Bourgogne]] passes through the heart of Dijon and creates a navigable route to Paris in the north-west via the river [[Yonne (river)|Yonne]], a tributary of the river [[Seine]], and to the [[Saône]] river 25&nbsp;km to the south-east. The canal joins the Saône at [[Saint-Jean-de-Losne]] which is the barging centre of France and Europe. In addition to the connection to the Atlantic via the Seine it has navigable water connections to the Mediterranean—via the Saône to the Rhône river at Lyon and further south (ultimately west to the Atlantic via the [[Canal du Midi]])—Germany and central Europe—via the [[Rhône-Rhine canal]]—plus west to the centre and river Loire via the [[Canal du Centre (France)|Canal du Centre]]. These waterways were largely completed before the 19th century and were the main means of industrial transport until the railways began taking over in the mid-19th century. Today they form a water route for mostly pleasure craft between northern Europe and the south. For example the route through Dijon is popular with those sailing their boats from the United Kingdom to the Mediterranean.

=== Public transport ===
==== Trains ====
Dijon is an important railway junction for lines from Paris to Lyon and [[Marseille]], and the east–west lines to [[Besançon]], [[Belfort]], [[Nancy, France|Nancy]], Switzerland, and Italy. The [[Dijon-Ville station]] is the main railway station, providing service to [[Paris-Gare de Lyon]] by [[TGV]] [[High-speed rail|high-speed train]] ([[LGV Sud-Est]]), covering the {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} in one hour and 40 minutes. For comparison, Lyon is {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}} away and two hours distant by standard train. The city of Nice takes about six hours by TGV and Strasbourg only 1 hour and 56 minutes via the TGV Rhin-Rhône. [[Lausanne]] in Switzerland is less than {{convert|150|km|0|abbr=on}} away or two hours by train. Dijon has a direct overnight sleeper/couchette service to Milan, Verona and Venice by the operator [[Thello]]. Numerous regional [[TER Bourgogne-Franche-Comté]] trains depart from the same station. There is another railway station east of the city centre, [[Dijon-Porte-Neuve station]], on the line to Is-sur-Tille and Culmont-Chalindrey.

==== Trams ====
A [[Dijon Tramway|new tram system]] opened in September 2012. Line T1 is an {{convert|8.5|km|1|abbr=off}} line with 16 stations running west–east from the [[Dijon railway station]] to [[Quetigny]].<ref name="RG0710">{{cite news|title=Pioneering PPP energises Dijon tram|url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/pioneering-ppp-energises-dijon-tram.html|publisher=Railway Gazette|date=21 July 2010|access-date=25 June 2012|archive-date=24 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120924060958/http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/pioneering-ppp-energises-dijon-tram.html|url-status=live}}</ref> Line T2 opened in December 2012, an {{convert|11.5|km|1|abbr=in}} north–south line with 21 stations running between Valmy and Chenôve.

==Culture==

[[Dijon mustard]] originated in 1856, when Jean Naigeon of Dijon substituted [[verjuice]], the acidic "green" juice of not-quite-ripe grapes, for vinegar in the traditional mustard recipe.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jack E. Staub, Ellen Buchert|title=75 Exceptional Herbs for Your Garden  |publisher=Gibbs Smith|date=18 August 2008|page=170|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zAMiGwoAfQ4C&pg=PA170|isbn=9781423608776 }}</ref> In general, mustards from Dijon today contain white wine rather than verjuice. Dijon mustard is not necessarily produced near Dijon, as the term is regarded as [[Genericized trademark|genericized]] under [[Law of the European Union|European Union law]], so that it cannot be registered for [[Protected Geographical Status|protected designation of origin]] status.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l66044.htm |title=SCADPlus: Protection of Geographical Indications and Designations of Origin |work=Europa (web portal) |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090310042208/http://europa.eu/scadplus/leg/en/lvb/l66044.htm |archive-date=10 March 2009 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Most Dijon mustard (brands such as [[Amora (mustard)|Amora]] or [[Maille (company)|Maille]]) is produced industrially and over 90% of mustard seed used in local production is imported, mainly from Canada. In 2008, Unilever closed its Amora mustard factory in Dijon. Dijon mustard shops sell exotic or unusually-flavoured mustard (fruit-flavoured, for example), often sold in decorative hand-painted ''[[faience]]'' (china) pots.

Burgundy is a world-famous wine growing region, and notable vineyards, such as [[Vosne-Romanée]] and [[Gevrey-Chambertin]], are within 20 minutes of the city center. The town's university boasts a renowned enology institute. The road from [[Santenay, Côte-d'Or|Santenay]] to Dijon is known as the "[[route des Grands Crus]]", where eight of the world's top ten most expensive wines are produced, according to Wine Searcher.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wine-searcher.com/most-expensive-wines |title=World's Top 50 Most Expensive Wines |publisher=Wine-Searcher |access-date=5 May 2009 |archive-date=15 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140215025824/http://www.wine-searcher.com/most-expensive-wines |url-status=live }}</ref>

The city is also well known for its ''[[crème de cassis]]'', or blackcurrant [[liqueur]], used in the drink known as "[[Kir (cocktail)|Kir]]", named after former mayor of Dijon [[canon (priest)|canon]] [[Félix Kir]], a mixture of crème de cassis with white wine, traditionally [[Bourgogne Aligoté AOC|Bourgogne Aligoté]].

Dijon is home to [[Dijon FCO]], a football club with a men's team competing in the Championnat National and [[Dijon FCO (women)|a women's team]] competing in the [[Division 1 Féminine]]. Dijon has a its own (Pro A) basketball club, [[JDA Dijon Basket]]. The [[Palais des Sports de Dijon]] serves as playground for the team and hosted international basketball events such as the FIBA [[EuroBasket 1999]] in the past. Dijon is home to the [[Ducs de Dijon|Dijon Ducs]] ice hockey team, who play in the [[Ligue Magnus|Magnus League]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dhc.reseau-concept.net/|title=Duc's Official Website|author=Dijon Hockey Club|language=fr|access-date=1 October 2010|archive-date=2 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202015225/http://www.dhc.reseau-concept.net/|url-status=dead}}</ref> To the northwest, the [[race track]] of [[Dijon-Prenois]] hosts various [[Motorsport|motor sport]] events.
