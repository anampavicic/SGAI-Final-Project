'''Joliet''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|dʒ|oʊ|l|i|ɛ|t|,_|ˌ|dʒ|oʊ|l|i|ˈ|ɛ|t}} {{respell|JOH|lee|et|,_-|ET}}) is a city in [[Will County, Illinois|Will]] and [[Kendall County, Illinois|Kendall]] counties in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Illinois]], {{convert|35|mi|km}} southwest of [[Chicago]]. It is the [[county seat]] of Will County. It had a population of 150,362 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], making it the [[List of municipalities in Illinois|third-most populous city in Illinois]].<ref name="wwwcensusgov">{{cite web|title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Joliet city, Illinois|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/jolietcityillinois/PST045219|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|access-date=August 13, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Joliet city, Illinois|url=https://data.census.gov/cedsci/profile?g=1600000US1738570|website=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=February 23, 2021}}</ref>

==History==
In 1673, [[Louis Jolliet]], along with Father [[Jacques Marquette]], paddled up the Des Plaines River and camped on a huge earthwork mound, a few miles south of present-day Joliet.<ref name="encychi">{{Cite book|author1=Grossman, James R. |author2=Keating, Ann Durkin |author3=Reiff, Janice L. |title=Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|year=2005|orig-year=2004|edition=Online|page=676|publisher=Chicago Historical Society, Newberry Library|location=Chicago|isbn=0-226-31015-9|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/676.html|oclc=60342627}}</ref> Maps from Jolliet's exploration of the area showed a large hill or mound down river from Chicago, labeled Mont Joliet.<ref name="1674-map">{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/11574.html|title=Jolliet's Map of New France, 1674|website=The Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago|access-date=July 28, 2021}}</ref> The mound has since been flattened due to [[mining]].

In 1833, following the [[Black Hawk War]], Charles Reed built a cabin along the west side of the [[Des Plaines River]]. Across the river in 1834, James B. Campbell, treasurer of the canal commissioners, laid out the village of "Juliet", a corruption of "Joliet" that was also in use at the time. Just before the economic depression of 1837, Juliet incorporated as a village, but to cut tax expenses, Juliet residents soon petitioned the state to rescind that incorporation.

In 1845, local residents changed the community's name from "Juliet" to "Joliet", reflecting the original name. Joliet was reincorporated as a city in 1852. Cornelius Covenhoven Van Horne was active in getting the city its first [[City Charter|charter]], and because of this, he was elected Joliet's first [[mayor]]. When the city later built a new bridge, it was named the Van Horne Bridge.<ref name="ft">{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogy.com/ftm/b/o/y/Robert-C-Boyett/WEBSITE-0001/UHP-0600.html|title=Robert-C-Boyett - User Trees - Genealogy.com|website=www.genealogy.com|access-date=May 2, 2018}}</ref>

==Geography==

According to the 2010 census, Joliet has a total area of {{convert|62.768|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|62.11|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 98.95%) are land and {{convert|0.658|sqmi|sqkm|2}} (or 1.05%) is covered by water.<ref name="census-g001">{{cite web

They are: Joliet, Plainfield, Troy, New Lenox, Jackson, Channahon, and Lockport in Will County, and Na-Au-Say and Seward in Kendall County. Joliet developed along the Des Plaines River, and its downtown is located in the river valley.

Joliet has a "west side" and "[[Joliet East Side Historic District|east side]]", referring to areas in relation to the river.

With the construction of highways and suburban development to the west, many businesses moved from the downtown area to the expanding areas west of the river. Many stores relocated to the west side in new strip malls and shopping centers with more parking and easier access. These changes resulted in the decline of the downtown shopping district, which is still felt today. Today, Joliet has a "west side" and a "far west side" (which includes all city limits in Kendall County). This has given rise to a newly referenced "Central Joliet" portion of the city, which essentially is all land west of the Des Plaines River and east of [[Interstate 55]]. This new reference may soon change the current meaning of "west side" to west of I-55.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

=== Climate ===
Joliet has a hot summer [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Dfa'') with hot, humid summers, and cold winters with moderate to heavy snowfall.

==Economy==
Like many Midwestern and East Coast cities dependent on manufacturing industries, Joliet has experienced past economic troubles. {{as of|2013}}, the rate of unemployment in Joliet was around 8.6%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unemployment Rate in Chicago-Naperville-Joliet|url=http://research.stlouisfed.org/fred2/series/CHIC917URN|work=FRED Economic Data|date=January 1990|publisher=Federal Reserve Bank of St.Louis|access-date=March 16, 2013}}</ref> The city is evolving from a steel and manufacturing suburb to a commuter suburb in the [[Chicago metropolitan area]]. Some new migrants to the Chicago area are working in bordering Cook County (the nation's second-most populous county) and living in Joliet.

The downtown area of Joliet has slowly attracted new businesses to the area. The main attractions in Joliet's city center are the [[Harrah's Joliet|Harrah's Casino]], [[Joliet Slammers]] baseball ([[Duly Health and Care Field]]), Hollywood Casino, and the [[Rialto Square Theatre]], also known as the 'Jewel of Joliet',<ref name="Huebner2001">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQV4qKcpHXcC&pg=PA26|title=Murals : the Great Walls of Joliet|last=Huebner|first=Jeff|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2001|isbn=978-0-252-06957-4|pages=25–26}}</ref> and has been called one of the world's 10 most beautiful theaters.

The structure is set on bedrock and the entire basement floor is made of Joliet limestone from the building owner's quarry. The walls of the structure are constructed of red Illinois sandstone and deep red brick specially fired in Ohio (wrapped individually and shipped by barge to Joliet). A commanding three-story tower is the focal point of the structure.  The structure has steel trim with slate shingles on a mansard roof. The front and side porches are single slabs of limestone. The largest stone ever quarried lies in the sidewalk under the front entry gate. The stone is 9×22×20&nbsp;ft. In 1885, an immense Byzantine dome was added to the south façade.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cityofjoliet.info/government/boards-commissions/joliet-historic-preservation-commission/national-register-properties/jacob-henry-mansion|title=The Jacob Henry Mansion|website=City of Joliet, IL|language=en|archive-url=https://archive.today/20181027150029/http://cityofjoliet.info/government/boards-commissions/joliet-historic-preservation-commission/national-register-properties/jacob-henry-mansion|archive-date=2018-10-27|url-status=live|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref>

===Transportation===
[[File:Joliet station.jpg|thumb|[[Joliet Transportation Center]], served by [[Amtrak]] and [[Metra]] passenger trains]]
[[File:Cass Street Bridge in Joliet, Illinois (2012).jpg|thumb|The Cass Street Bridge is one of five 1930s [[bascule bridge]]s spanning the [[Des Plaines River]] in Joliet.]]
Situated about {{convert|40|mi|km}} southwest of central Chicago, Joliet has long been a significant transportation hub. It lies on both sides of the Des Plaines River, a major waterway in [[Northern Illinois]], and was one of the principal ports on the [[Illinois and Michigan Canal]]. The [[Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific Railroad|Chicago & Rock Island Railroad]] and [[Michigan Central]] came through in the 1850s, and the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] and [[Chicago & Alton Railroad]] soon followed, with the [[Elgin, Joliet and Eastern Railway]] and [[Milwaukee Road]] lines built around the turn of the century.

U.S. Highways [[U.S. Route 6|6]] (the Grand Army of the Republic Highway), [[U.S. Route 30|30]] (the Lincoln Highway), [[U.S. Route 45|45]], [[U.S. Route 52|52]], and [[U.S. Route 66|66]] (Route 66) all ran through the city. In the 1960s, Interstate 55 and [[Interstate 80]] made their way through Joliet, linking up near Channahon just west of the city limits. The phrase "Crossroads of Mid-America", found on the Joliet seal, is an allusion to the intersection of I-80 and I-55 (and, historically, the intersection between the Lincoln Highway and Route 66).

[[Joliet Transportation Center]] is the final stop on the [[Metra]] rail lines from Chicago for the [[Heritage Corridor]] route from [[Chicago Union Station]] and the [[Rock Island District]] route from [[LaSalle Street Station]]. A third line, the [[Suburban Transit Access Route|STAR Line]], would have also terminated at the station, but the project was shelved as of 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pyke|first=Marni|title=Do fast buses on I-90 mean falling STAR line?|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20120118/news/701189697/|accessdate=22 December 2012|newspaper=Daily Herald|date=18 January 2012}}</ref>
