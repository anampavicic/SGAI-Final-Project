Today, Wrexham continues to serve north Wales and the [[Wales-England border|Welsh borderlands]] as a centre for manufacturing, retail, education and administration. The city is noted for hosting [[Wrexham A.F.C.]] (one of the oldest professional football teams in the world); the nationally significant industrial heritage of the [[Clywedog Trail|Clywedog Valley]]; the National Trust Property of [[Erddig]]; and the fine Tudor church of [[St Giles' Church, Wrexham|St Giles]], which towers over the historic [[Wrexham city centre]].

The [[Battle of Chester]] circa 615/616 marked the beginning of a long struggle between the Welsh and English for territory in this part of Wales. During the eighth century, the Anglo-Saxon royal house of [[Mercia]] pushed their frontiers westwards and established the earth boundaries of [[Wat's Dyke]] and [[Offa's Dyke]] to the west of the present city.

It was probably during this first period of Mercian advance in the eighth century that the settlement of Wrexham was founded on the flat ground above the meadows of the [[River Gwenfro]].<ref name="Dodd-1957">{{cite book |last=Dodd |first=Arthur Herbert |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e2k1AQAAIAAJ&q=dodd+wrexham |title=A History of Wrexham, Denbighshire: Published for the Wrexham Borough Council in Commemoration of the Centenary of the Incorporation of the Borough, 1857–1957 |date=1957 |publisher=Hughes}}</ref> The name Wrexham probably comes from the old English for Wryhtel's river meadow.<ref name="WREXHAM {{!}} Coflein" /> Alternatively, the name may have described a settlement of the [[Wreocensæte]] people, who were possibly a continuation of the Cornovii tribe of Roman Britain.<ref>{{cite book |last=Higham |first=N.

The Mercians fought over north-east Wales during the eighth to tenth centuries but the Welsh Kings of Powys re-conquered the Wrexham area during the 11th century.

Stability under the princes of [[Powys Fadog]] enabled Wrexham to develop as a trading town and administrative centre of one of the two [[commote]]s making up the Lordship. In 1202, [[Madog ap Gruffydd Maelor|Madoc ap Gruffydd Maelor]], Lord of [[Castell Dinas Brân|Dinas Brân]], granted some of his demesne lands in 'Wrechcessham' to the abbey of [[Valle Crucis Abbey|Valle Crucis]] and in 1220 the earliest reference to a church in Wrexham is made.<ref name="A History of Wrexham" />

Following the [[Edwardian conquest of Wales|loss of Welsh independence]] and the death in battle of Prince [[Llywelyn ap Gruffudd]] in 1282, Wrexham became part of the semi-independent [[Welsh Marches|Marcher]] lordship of Bromfield and Yale.<ref name="Dodd-1957"/> Wrexham increased in importance throughout the Middle Ages as the lordship's administrative centre, and the then town's position made it a suitable centre for the exchange of the produce of the Dee valley and Denbighshire uplands, whilst iron and lead were also mined locally.<ref name="Dodd-1957"/>

=== Early Modern ===
The [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542|Acts of Union]] passed during the reign of Henry VIII brought the lordship into the full system of English administration and law. It became part of the new shire of [[Denbighshire (historic)|Denbighshire]] in 1536.

In 1584 [[St Richard Gwyn]], a local [[Recusant]], schoolteacher, and poet in the Welsh-language, was convicted of [[high treason]] based on his Catholic beliefs by a panel of judges headed by the [[Chief Justice]] of [[Chester]], [[George Bromley (politician)|Sir George Bromley]]. On 15 October 1584, Gwyn was taken to the Beast Market and [[hung, drawn and quartered]] for his faith. He was [[canonised]] by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1970 as one of the [[Forty Martyrs of England and Wales]]. His Feast Day is 17 October.<ref>{{cite web |title=St. Richard Gwyn – Saints & Angels |url=https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=4599 |access-date=25 August 2020 |website=Catholic Online |archive-date=8 August 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200808205534/https://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=4599 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The economic character remained predominantly as an agricultural market town into the 17th century but there were workshops of weavers, smiths, nailers as well as dye houses. The 1620 Norden's jury of survey{{clarify|date=July 2015}} of Wrexham Regis stated that four-fifths of the land-holding classes of Wrexham bore Welsh names and every field except one within the manor bore a Welsh or semi-Welsh name.

A grammar school was established in 1603 by Alderman Valentine Broughton of Chester.<ref name="Dodd-1957" />

Wrexham was known for its leather industry and by the 18th century there were a number of skinners and tanners in the town. {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The Industrial Revolution began in Wrexham in 1762 when the entrepreneur [[John Wilkinson (industrialist)|John Wilkinson]] (1728–1808), known as "Iron Mad Wilkinson", opened [[Bersham Ironworks]]. Wilkinson's steam engines enabled a peak of production{{clarify|date=July 2015}} at [[Minera Leadmines|Minera Lead Mines]] on the outskirts of Wrexham.

From the late 18th century numerous large-scale industrialised{{clarify|date=July 2015}} collieries operated in the southern section of the [[Denbighshire Coalfield|North East Wales coalfield]], alongside hundreds of more traditional small-scale pits belonging to a mining tradition dating back to the Middle Ages.{{Citation needed|date=May 2016}}

Rev. [[William Bingley]] described Wrexham in 1839 as "of such size and consequence as to have occasionally obtained the appellation of the metropolis of North Wales". Wrexham gained its first newspaper in 1848. The Market Hall was built in 1848, and in 1863 a volunteer fire brigade was founded. {{Citation needed|date=May 2016}} In addition to brewing, tanning became one of Wrexham's main industries. In the mid 19th century Wrexham was granted [[borough]] status.

By 1851, the population of Wrexham was 6,714; within thirty years this had increased to 10,978<ref>{{cite book |last1=O Leary |first1=Paul |title=Irish Migrants in Modern Wales |date=2004 |publisher=Liverpool University Press |pages=83–101}}</ref> as the town became increasingly industrialised.

Wrexham benefited from good underground water supplies which were essential to the brewing of beer: by the mid-19th century, there were 19 breweries in and around the town. [[Wrexham Lager]] brewery was established in 1882 in Central Road and became the first brewery in the United Kingdom to produce lager beer. A permanent military presence was established in the town with the completion of [[Hightown Barracks]] in 1877.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.chris-myers.co.uk/buildings-and-places-of-wrexham-past-and-present.html |title=Buildings and places of Wrexham past and present |access-date=14 November 2014 |archive-date=26 November 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141126103001/http://www.chris-myers.co.uk/buildings-and-places-of-wrexham-past-and-present.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The [[Poyser Street drill hall, Wrexham|Poyser Street drill hall]] was completed in 1902.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.drillhalls.org/TownWrexham.htm |title=Wrexham |publisher=The Drill Hall Project |access-date=19 August 2017 |archive-date=21 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170821044455/http://www.drillhalls.org/TownWrexham.htm |url-status=live }}</ref>

When the 1912 [[National Eisteddfod of Wales]] was held at Wrexham, [[T.H. Parry-Williams]] achieved for the first time the feat, almost unheard of since, of winning both [[Chairing of the Bard|the Chair]] and [[Crowning of the Bard|the Crown]]. Parry-Williams later recalled returning home to [[Rhyd-ddu]], where he had been working as a hired hand upon the farm of a relative. Upon telling his employer of his double-victory, Parry-Williams was advised to, "seek grace." When Parry-Williams then explained that both victories had gained him £40, the relative shouted in angry disbelief, ''"Ac mi gwnest nhw i gyd ar dy din!!!"'' ("And you earned them all sitting on your arse!!!!")<ref>Edwards (2016), ''The Eisteddfod'', pages 76-77.</ref>

By 1913, the North East Wales coal field was producing up to 3 million tonnes a year and employed over 10,000 people, dominating the economic and cultural life of the area. {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} One of the worst mining disasters in British history occurred at [[Gresford Colliery]] in 1934 when underground explosions and a subsequent fire cost the lives of 266 men. However the industry went into decline after the [[First World War]], and of the seven large-scale collieries operating in the Wrexham area in 1946, only two functional collieries remained by 1968. {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} The last pit to close in the Borough was Bersham Colliery in 1986.The leatherworks in Pentrefelin and Tuttle Street, the many coal mines in the area, the brickworks in Abenbury, [[Brymbo Steelworks]] and the breweries all closed in the latter half of the 20th century. Wrexham suffered from the same problems as much of industrialised Britain and saw little investment in the 1970s.

In the 1980s and 1990s, the [[Welsh Development Agency]] (WDA) funded a major dual carriageway {{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} (the A483) bypassing Wrexham town centre and connecting it with nearby Chester and with England's trunk road network. New shopping areas have been created within the town at Henblas Square, [[Island Green]] and [[Eagles Meadow]] and the [[Wrexham Industrial Estate]], previously used in the [[Second World War]], has become home to many manufacturing businesses.

Wrexham Town Hall, an early 18th century arcaded structure with an assembly hall on the first floor, which had been built at the top of Town Hall, was demolished to improve traffic flows in the area in February 1940.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wrexham-history.com/the-old-town-hall-town-hill-wrexham/ |title=The Old Town Hall, Town Hill, Wrexham |publisher=Wrexham History |access-date=22 February 2021 |archive-date=3 December 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201203110055/https://www.wrexham-history.com/the-old-town-hall-town-hill-wrexham/ |url-status=usurped }}</ref>

Wrexham is not built on a major river, but on a relatively flat plateau between the lower [[River Dee, Wales|Dee Valley]] and [[Clwydian Range|easternmost mountains]] of [[North East Wales|north-east Wales]]. This position enabled it to grow as a market town, as a crossroads between England and Wales, and later as an industrial hub – due to its rich natural reserves of iron ore and coal. But three small rivers flow through parts of the city: the [[River Clywedog|Clywedog]], Gwenfro and [[River Alyn|Alyn]]. Wrexham is also famed for the quality of its underground water reserves,<ref name="WREXHAM {{!}} Coflein"/> which gave rise to its previous dominance as a major brewing centre.

Originally a market town with surrounding urban villages, Wrexham has now coalesced with a number of urban villages and forms North Wales' largest city<!-- "and conurbation" removed as the Wrexham BUA was reduced and the ONS has not revealed conurbation figures as of August 2023. -->.

[[File:Wrexhamtown.jpg|thumb|Hope Street, Wrexham city centre|alt=|199x199px]]{{Main|Wrexham city centre}}
The historic city centre contains a large number of listed buildings set on a Medieval street pattern radiating out from the Parish Church of St Giles which was the focal point around which the city developed. The church precinct, and the surrounding narrow enclosed streets and alleyways retain a medieval character. Several complete medieval buildings survive on Town Hill and [[Church Street, Wrexham|Church Street]].<ref name="CouncilWrexhamCA2">{{cite web |last=contact-us@wrexham.gov.uk |first=Wrexham County Borough Council, Guildhall, Wrexham LL11 1AY, UK |title=Wrexham Town Centre Conservation Area – WCBC |url=http://old.wrexham.gov.uk/english/planning_portal/historic_environment/wrexham_town_centre.htm |access-date=2 September 2020 |website=old.wrexham.gov.uk |archive-date=24 January 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210124082001/http://old.wrexham.gov.uk/english/planning_portal/historic_environment/wrexham_town_centre.htm |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Hope Street, Regent Street and Queen Street form the traditional main shopping streets and are wider in some parts than others, resulting from the location of the street markets, which occurred from Medieval times through to the 19th century.<ref name="CouncilWrexhamCA2" /> The shopping streets and indoor markets are interconnected by historic narrow alleyways and arcades, such as Bank Street and [[Central Arcade, Wrexham|Central Arcade]], which host small independent businesses. The half-timbered [[Talbot Hotel, Wrexham|Talbot Hotel building]], built in 1904, stands in a prominent position at the junction of Hope Street and Queen Street.

A total of 37 parks and green spaces in Wrexham County Borough Council ownership have been, or are in the process of being, legally protected with green space charity [[Fields in Trust]] ensuring they can never be built on, nor lost to development.<ref>{{cite web |title=Protecting Wrexham's Green Spaces for Good |url=https://www.fieldsintrust.org/wrexham |website=Fields in Trust |access-date=3 April 2022 |archive-date=26 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220526212010/https://www.fieldsintrust.org/wrexham |url-status=live }}</ref>

Wrexham has three parks, [[Bellevue Park, Wrexham|Bellevue Park]], [[Acton Park, Wrexham|Acton Park]] and the parkland at Erddig, as well as a green area within the city centre called [[Llwyn Isaf]].

Bellevue Park was built alongside the old cemetery on Ruabon Road. The park was designed to commemorate the jubilee year of the incorporation of Wrexham. It became neglected during the 1970s and many of the amenities were in a poor state of repair. A major project was undertaken to restore the park to its original state. The park reopened in June 2000. In 2015 Belle Vue Park was dedicated as a Fields in Trust Centenary Field because of its links with veterans of two world wars.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fieldsintrust.org/FieldSite/Bellevue-Park |title=Belle Vue Park, Wrexham |publisher=Fields in Trust |access-date=13 October 2021 |archive-date=28 October 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211028171431/https://www.fieldsintrust.org/FieldSite/Bellevue-Park |url-status=dead }}</ref>

[[File:Wrexham Cathedral (geograph 5518262 cropped).jpg|right|thumb|St Mary's Cathedral, Wrexham|193x193px]]

===St. Mary's Cathedral===
The Roman Catholic [[Wrexham Cathedral|Cathedral of Our Lady of Sorrows]] in Regent Street is the main church of the [[Bishop of Wrexham|Diocese of Wrexham]], which extends over all of North Wales. Built in 1857 after [[Catholic Emancipation]] and at the height of the [[Gothic Revival]], the cathedral was home to the [[Bishop of Menevia]] from 1898 until 1987, whose diocese covered all of Wales. However, in 1987 the Roman Catholic province of Wales was reconstructed, since which time the cathedral has been home to the Bishop of Wrexham. The cathedral is also home to the relic of [[Saint Richard Gwyn]], Wrexham's [[patron saint]], who was a Roman Catholic martyr in the 16th century. Richard was [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] at Wrexham's Beast Market. He was canonised by [[Pope Paul VI]] in 1970.

{{Main|Wrexham University}}
Wrexham University was formed when the North East Wales Institute (NEWI) was granted full university status in 2008. It consists of Plas Coch campus in the western part of the city and the North Wales School of Art and Design located on Regent Street. The institution was founded in 1887 as the Wrexham School of Science and Art.

===Yale College (Coleg Cambria)===
{{Main|Yale College, Wrexham}}
Yale College (now part of [[Coleg Cambria]]) is the main provider of adult education in Wrexham and is one of the largest colleges in Wales. As a tertiary college it also provides a wide range of higher education courses at its two campuses at Grove Park in the city centre and Bersham Road in southwest Wrexham.

It was named after Elihu Yale, best known for being the prime benefactor of Yale University. It was founded in 1950 as a state school on a site at Crispin Lane. In 1973, as part of the conversion of local schools to the comprehensive system, it was renamed as Yale Sixth Form College and the pupils re-located to other schools. The Crispin Lane site was incorporated into NEWI (now Glyndŵr University) after the development of the Grove Park Campus.

In 1998 Yale College took up residence in two sites across Wrexham: the faculty of engineering and construction at a site on Bersham Road, and a multi-purpose site in a redeveloped Grove Park campus. Over the next fifteen years the college grew.

In 2013 Yale College was merged with Deeside College, Northop College, and Llysfasi College to form a new college, Coleg Cambria, under the leadership of the ex-Deeside principal David Jones. The merger officially took place on 1 August 2013.

For the 2020–21 academic year, one of Coleg Cambria's Yale Grove Park Campus in Wrexham city centre underwent redevelopment. With a cost of £20 million, the new Hafod building is described to be a "commercial village" in Wrexham.<ref>{{cite web |date=April 2019 |title=The Halton Curve: Small piece of track, big rail ambitions |url=https://www.dailypost.co.uk/business/business-news/20m-coleg-cambria-campus-redevelopment-16057438 |access-date=3 April 2019 |website=www.dailypost.co.uk |archive-date=3 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403004205/https://www.dailypost.co.uk/business/business-news/20m-coleg-cambria-campus-redevelopment-16057438 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===Schools===
Wrexham has a number of primary and secondary schools. It has just one Welsh-speaking secondary school, [[Ysgol Morgan Llwyd]]. In 2003, three of the largest secondary schools, St David's School, Ysgol Bryn Offa and The [[Groves High School, Wrexham|Groves High School]] were merged to create two larger "super schools", [[Rhosnesni High School]], and [[Ysgol Clywedog]].

==Twin municipalities==
The city of Wrexham is [[Sister city|twinned]] with the German district of [[Märkischer Kreis]] and the Polish town of [[Racibórz]].

The first twinning was established on 17 March 1970 between the former Kreis Iserlohn and Wrexham Rural District. Its early success ensured that, after local government reorganisation in both countries in the mid-seventies, the twinning was taken over by the new Councils of Märkischer Kreis and Wrexham Maelor Borough Council and, in 1996, by Wrexham County Borough Council.

In 2001 Märkischer Kreis entered a twinning arrangement with Racibórz (Ratibor), a county in Poland, which was formerly part of Silesia, Germany. In September 2002, a delegation from Racibórz visited Wrexham and began initial discussions about possible co-operation which led, eventually, to the signing of Articles of Twinning between Wrexham and Racibórz in March 2004. The Wrexham area has strong historical links with Poland. Following World War II, many service personnel from the Free Polish armed forces who had been injured received treatment at [[Penley]] Polish Hospital. Many of their descendants remain in the area to this day.
