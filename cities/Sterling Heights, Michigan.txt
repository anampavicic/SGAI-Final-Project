'''Sterling Heights''' is a city in [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb County]] in the U.S. state of [[Michigan]]. A northern [[Metro Detroit|suburb of Detroit]], Sterling Heights is located roughly {{convert|18|mi|km|1}} north of [[downtown Detroit]]. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 134,346, placing Sterling Heights as the second-largest suburb of Detroit, and the [[List of municipalities in Michigan|fourth-most populous city in Michigan]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/sterlingheightscitymichigan/POP010220 |title=U.S. Census Bureau QuickFacts: Sterling Heights city, Michigan |publisher=Census.gov |date= |accessdate=2022-07-19 |archive-date=2022-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220815140027/https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/sterlingheightscitymichigan/POP010220 |url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==
As a result of the [[War of 1812]] and the 1817 [[Treaty of Fort Meigs]], the area of the [[Michigan Territory]] which now makes up Sterling Heights was first surveyed by Deputy Surveyor Joseph Wampler; his survey was approved on February 20, 1818.<ref>{{cite web |title=Survey Details - BLM GLO Records |url=https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/survey/default.aspx?dm_id=26465&sid=ixm4sm01.3pk |access-date=2022-05-16 |website=glorecords.blm.gov |archive-date=2022-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220815044705/https://glorecords.blm.gov/details/survey/default.aspx?dm_id=26465&sid=ixm4sm01.3pk |url-status=live }}</ref> Wampler had been one of two deputy surveyors of [[Perrysburg, Ohio]], in 1816.
[[File:SterlingHeightsNameChanges.png|thumb|Acts which created & modified Sterling Township]]
Originally created as part of [[Shelby Charter Township, Michigan|Shelby Township]] in April 1827,<ref>"An act to divide the several counties in this Territory into Townships, and for other purposes" - Laws of the Territory of Michigan, Volume 2, Pgs. 478-479</ref> it was broken off as Jefferson Township in March 1835.<ref>"An Act organizing certain townships" - Laws of the Territory of Michigan, Volume 3, pgs. 1367-1369</ref> In March 1838, it was renamed Sterling Township.<ref>"An Act to organize certain townships and for other purposes" - Acts of the Michigan Legislature adjourned session of 1837, regular session of 1838; pgs. 76-84</ref>

Until the 1950s, Sterling Township was an agricultural area, largely devoted to growing [[rhubarb]] and other crops sold in Detroit.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sterling Heights, MI - Official Website|url=https://www.sterling-heights.net/Archive.aspx?AMID=43|access-date=2021-01-12|website=www.sterling-heights.net|archive-date=2021-01-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210122184913/https://sterling-heights.net/Archive.aspx?AMID=43|url-status=live}}</ref> Road improvements led to decreased commute times and lower costs for the delivery of goods and services to and from businesses. The population increased when suburban homes were built for the workers in metropolitan Detroit's booming automobile industry. When Sterling Township was [[incorporation (municipal government)|incorporated]] as a city in 1968, "Heights" was added to the name to satisfy a state law that prevents incorporated municipalities from having the same name, as there was already a small village named [[Sterling, Michigan|Sterling]] in [[Arenac County, Michigan|Arenac County]].<ref>[https://www.sterling-heights.net/bins/site/templates/default.asp?area_2=pages/comm/history/pre-cityhistory/pre-cityhistory_506.dat&area_1=pages/nav/comm/history/history.dat&area_3=0.dat&area_0=0.dat&area_8=0.dat&objectid=BEB01220&ml_index=2&NC=758X Pre-City History] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628204002/https://www.sterling-heights.net/bins/site/templates/default.asp?area_2=pages%2Fcomm%2Fhistory%2Fpre-cityhistory%2Fpre-cityhistory_506.dat&area_1=pages%2Fnav%2Fcomm%2Fhistory%2Fhistory.dat&area_3=0.dat&area_0=0.dat&area_8=0.dat&objectid=BEB01220&ml_index=2&NC=758X|date=2014-06-28}}, The Official Site of the City of Sterling Heights</ref>

Gerald Donovan became the first mayor of the city and F. James Dunlop became the first mayor [[Pro tempore|pro-tempore]]. In the 1960s and 1970s, many residents came to live in Sterling Heights to work in automobile plants operated by [[Chrysler]] and [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]. [[Lakeside Mall]] opened in Sterling Heights in 1976.

The city is home to many groups of immigrants. It has received many people of eastern European origins, including ethnic Albanians, Bosnians, Croatians, Macedonians, Montenegrins, Poles, Serbians and Slovenians.<ref name="DublinMurray" /> After the 2003 [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-Iraqi War]], millions of Iraqi citizens were displaced, particularly [[Assyrians]], whom the majority of which adhere to the [[Chaldean Catholic Church]]. Of these, 30,000-50,000 resettled in Sterling Heights, giving parts of the city the nickname "Little Nineveh", especially around 15 Mile Road and Ryan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.secondwavemedia.com/metromode/features/SterlingHeightsChaldean0227.aspx|title=Little Baghdad in Sterling Heights|first=Nicole|last=Rupersburg|date=October 6, 2011|website=Metromode|language=en|access-date=2020-04-25|archive-date=2021-05-29|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210529183942/https://www.secondwavemedia.com/metromode/features/SterlingHeightsChaldean0227.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hourdetroit.com/art-and-entertainment/weam-namou-iraqi-american-author/|title=The Story Iraqi-American Author Weam Namou Almost Did Not Tell|last=Namou|first=Weam|date=2019-11-26|work=[[Hour Detroit Magazine]]|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-25|archive-date=2020-08-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200820093720/https://www.hourdetroit.com/art-and-entertainment/weam-namou-iraqi-american-author/|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Main highways===
Sterling Heights sits on two main thoroughfares:

====State highways====
*{{jct|state=MI|M|53}} commonly called Van Dyke Avenue or the Van Dyke Freeway (they split in the city, however, and rejoin to its north), which leads north into [[The Thumb]] of Michigan.
*{{jct|state=MI|M|59}}, commonly called Hall Road once the freeway ends—which is the east–west connector from just north of [[Mount Clemens, Michigan|Mount Clemens]], through [[Utica, Michigan|Utica]] as a surface road, and then becomes a limited access freeway to [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], being the main northern connector between [[Macomb County, Michigan|Macomb County]] and [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]]. In Sterling Heights, large areas are devoted to retail and commercial development (''e.g.'', [[Lakeside Mall]]).

====Other main roads====
*[[Mound Road]] is an important north–south artery that runs continuously through the city. Overall, the road starts south in [[Hamtramck, Michigan|Hamtramck]] and runs up to 32 Mile Road in [[Romeo, Michigan|Romeo]]. The road ends briefly at River Bends Park in Shelby Township (becoming Auburn Road), and continues just north of 22 Mile Road.
*East-west travel is mainly on the "mile roads," beginning at 14 Mile Road through 20 Mile Road (M-59). 16 Mile Road, also known as [[Metropolitan Parkway (Detroit area)|Metro Parkway]], is another major "mile road". See [[Roads and freeways in metropolitan Detroit]].
*Utica Road is an important diagonal connector that crisscrosses the city from southeast to northwest, going through the intersection of Dodge Park Road (across from the Sterling Heights city hall) via the first roundabout in Macomb County.
*Dequindre Road is the border between the city of Sterling Heights and the city of [[Troy, Michigan|Troy]]. It is also the border between the counties of Macomb and [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland]].
*Hayes Road is the divider between Clinton Township (Between Utica Road and South of M59) and Fraser (Between Masonic and Moravian).
