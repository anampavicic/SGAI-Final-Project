'''Gunpo''' ({{Korean|hangul=군포}}; {{IPA|ko|kun.pʰo}}), formerly [[Romanization of Korean|romanized]] as '''Kunp'o''', is a small city in [[South Korea]]'s [[Gyeonggi Province]], located south of [[Seoul]] in the [[Seoul National Capital Area]]. It borders [[Anyang, Gyeonggi|Anyang]] to the north, [[Uiwang]] to the east, and [[Ansan]] to the south and west, and is connected to its neighbors and to Seoul by lines [[Seoul Subway Line 1|1]] and [[Seoul Subway Line 4|4]] of the [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway]]. Gunpo is also home to three stops on the [[Gyeongbu Line]], a national railway that links it to the rest of the country. Although 73.2% of the city is greenspace, owing largely to [[Surisan]] and various smaller mountains, Gunpo is home to over 286,000 residents in several urban areas. The city's downtown core is [[Sanbon]] New Town, a commercial hub which centers on a pedestrian "street of culture" that Gunpo has designated as one of its eight scenic locations.

Gunpo was promoted from [[Eup (administrative division)|town]] to [[Administrative divisions of South Korea#Si .28City.29|city]] in 1989 due to the rapid urban and industrial growth of [[Seoul]], and large-scale housing projects were immediately begun. [[Hansei University]], a [[Christianity|Christian]] institute of post-secondary learning, is in the city, as are forty-four other public schools and a number of [[Hagwon|private academies]]. With eighty-three percent of its citizens holding public library memberships, Gunpo touts itself as a book-reading city, and it also promotes itself as being environmentally friendly and in harmony with nature.{{citation needed|date=December 2020}} Its residents include [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics – Ladies' singles|2010 Olympic figure skating gold medalist]] [[Yuna Kim]], who grew up in Gunpo after moving there at the age of six. Sightseeing locations around the city include the Banwol reservoir and the Royal Azaleas Hill, and [[Surisan]] is a hiking destination.

==History==
===Early history===
During the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] era of the [[Korean Peninsula]], the land that is now Gunpo was under the control of the [[Goguryeo]] dynasty, and it fell within Yulmok-[[Administrative divisions of South Korea#Gun .28County.29|gun]] (county) as of 475 CE. The area became Yuljin-gun under [[Unified Silla]] in the year 757, and in 940 it was renamed Gwaju-gun by the ruling [[Goryeo]] dynasty. The year 1413 saw the [[Joseon]] dynasty dub the area [[Gwacheon]]-[[hyeon]].<ref name="Gunpo history 1">{{Cite web|url=http://english.gunpo21.net/about/history/about_history_01.jsp|title=About Gunpo: History|website=Gunpo City|access-date=2014-05-01|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708050512/http://english.gunpo21.net/about/history/about_history_01.jsp|archive-date=8 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

In May 1895, the area containing present-day Gunpo became known as Nam-[[Myeon (administrative division)|myeon]], a division of Gwacheon-gun, but on 1 March 1914, a revision deemed that Nam-myeon now fell within [[Siheung County|Siheung-gun]]. Throughout the remainder of [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japan's annexation of Korea]] and the first several decades of the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], no changes were made to the designation of Nam-myeon or to its administrative districts, but a [[President of South Korea|presidential]] decree had the area promoted on 1 May 1979, to Gunpo-[[Eup (administrative division)|eup]] (town), which yet remained within Siheung-gun.<ref name="Gunpo history 1" />

[[Gunpo Station]], a railway stop on South Korea's nation-spanning [[Gyeongbu Line]], was first opened in 1905, and it was joined by nearby [[Geumjeong Station]] in 1988. Geumjeong's opening also saw [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|Seoul Subway]] Lines [[Seoul Subway Line 1|1]] and [[Seoul Subway Line 4|4]] expand into the town—both Geumjeong and Gunpo Stations serve as metro stops on Seoul Subway Line 1, and Geumjeong is also a transfer station to Line 4.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

===Promotion to city===
[[File:Sanbonfountain.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Sanbon New Town's fountain on a summer night]]
In 1989,<ref name="Gunpo history 1" /> the rapid industrial growth and urbanization of [[Seoul]] prompted the construction of five new cities in the [[Seoul Capital Area]]: Gunpo, [[Anyang, Gyeonggi|Anyang]], [[Seongnam]], [[Bucheon]], and [[Goyang]].<ref name="Gunpo introduction">{{Cite web|url=http://english.gunpo21.net/about/introduction/about_introduction_01.jsp|title=About Gunpo: Introduction|website=Gunpo City|access-date=2014-05-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100509233607/http://english.gunpo21.net/about/introduction/about_introduction_01.jsp|archive-date=9 May 2010|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The move was based on a national law which was intended to promote efficient regional management in the face of an increasing demand for administration. Siheung-gun was thus disbanded, and Gunpo-eup was promoted to Gunpo-[[Administrative divisions of South Korea#Si .28City.29|si]] (city).<ref name="Gunpo history 1" /> Five legal [[Dong (administrative division)|dongs]] (neighbourhoods) fell under Gunpo's jurisdiction, although some were further sub-divided into numerous administrative dongs—for example, Sanbon-dong was split into Sanbon 1-dong and Sanbon 2-dong.<ref name="Gunpo history 2" /> At 20.70&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, Gunpo maintained the smallest area of any city in South Korea.<ref name="Gunpo introduction" />

A large-scale housing complex zone was established in February 1989 when Gunpo City designated the entirety of Sanbon-dong, Geumjeong-dong, and Dang-dong as an anticipated residential land district.<ref name="Gunpo introduction" /> In December 1992, Gunpo City Hall relocated from Dang-dong to Geumjong-dong,<ref name="Gunpo history 2" /> and [[Sanbon Station]], on Seoul Subway Line 4, was also opened in 1992.

By 1994, there were ten administrative dongs in Gunpo but only five legal dongs.<ref name="Gunpo history 2" /> However, on 24 December of that year,<ref name="Gunpo introduction" /> four [[Ri (administrative division)|ris]] (villages) from neighbouring Banwol-myeon and Hwaseong-gun were incorporated into Gunpo due to the partial adjustment of administrative districts,<ref name="Gunpo history 2" /> and Gunpo's area grew to 36.38&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref name="Gunpo introduction" /> The city currently has nine legal dongs, or eleven administrative ones.<ref name="Gunpo history 2" /> The acquisition of Daeyami-ri from Banwol-myeon brought [[Daeyami Station]], on Seoul Subway Line 4, into Gunpo's city limits.

The development of [[Sanbon]] New Town was completed in 1995, and the area grew to become Gunpo's central hub.<ref name="Gunpo introduction" /> Sanbon's layout was devised by Kim Jinae, a famed Korean architect who also designed Seoul's [[Insa-dong]]<ref name="Kim Jinae">{{Cite web|url=http://www.jejunews.com/news/articleView.html?idxno=571806|script-title=ko:김진애 건축가 겸 국회의원 제주대문화광장 특강|access-date=2014-09-26|work=Jeju News|date=13 April 2010|author=조정현|language=ko}}</ref> and who was named one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''{{'s}} 100 leaders of the 21st century.<ref name="Kim Jinae" /><ref name="Kim Jinae 2">{{Cite web|url=http://kifaonline.com/modules/contents/ct_view.html?id=history_en&p=1&no=2&PHPSESSID=94b8969a043d1d360ca382cad845b7eb|title=History: 1990 - 1995|website=KIFA: Korean Institute of Female Architects|access-date=2014-09-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713092402/http://kifaonline.com/modules/contents/ct_view.html?id=history_en&p=1&no=2&PHPSESSID=94b8969a043d1d360ca382cad845b7eb|archive-date=13 July 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the year 2000, the new [[Revised Romanization of Korean]] formally changed the city's romanized name from Kunp'o to Gunpo.<ref name="Revised Romanization">{{Cite web|url=http://www.korea.net/korea/kor_loca.asp?code=A020303|title=Ministry of Culture & Tourism: ''The Revised Romanization of Korean''|access-date=2014-07-10|work=The National Institute of the Korean Language|date=July 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070916025652/http://www.korea.net/korea/kor_loca.asp?code=A020303|archive-date=2007-09-16}}</ref> 2003 brought the opening of [[Surisan Station]] between Daeyami and Sanbon, and in 2010, [[Dangjeong Station]] was opened on both Line 1 and the Gyeongbu Line, bringing the total number of metro stations in the city to six.

==Geography==
Gunpo is located in South Korea's [[Gyeonggi Province]], south of [[Seoul]] in the Seoul National Capital Area. It is nestled in between three other cities, bordering [[Anyang, Gyeonggi|Anyang]] to the north, [[Uiwang]] to the east, and [[Ansan]] to the south and the west. At 36.38&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, Gunpo makes up 0.36% of the province's total area. As of 1 January 2004, 17.8% of the city was residential area, 1.8% commercial, 7.2% industrial, and 73.2% greenspace.<ref name="Gunpo overview">{{Cite web|url=http://english.gunpo21.net/about/overview/about_overview_01.jsp|title=About Gunpo: Overview|website=Gunpo City|access-date=2014-05-15|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708141637/http://english.gunpo21.net/about/overview/about_overview_01.jsp|archive-date=8 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

[[File:Daeyadong.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Urban and rural lifestyles combine in the heart of Daeya-dong.]]
Gunpo is divided into nine legal dongs (neighborhoods).<ref name="Gunpo history 2" /> Four of those dongs—Sanbon-dong, Geumjeong-dong, Dang-dong, and Dangjeong-dong—are heavily urbanized residential, commercial, and industrial areas. Located in the northern end of Gunpo, they are serviced by Seoul Subway Lines 1 and 4. In the south of the city, Bugok-dong, Daeya-dong, and Domagyo-dong are largely rural, although Bugok-dong has seen recent urban development and Domagyo-dong has been earmarked for a development project of its own. Daeya-dong also contains a small urban area, which is serviced by Daeyami Station. On Gunpo's west side, Dundae-dong and Sokdal-dong contain large parts of the [[Surisan]] mountain and are mostly mountainous, with farmland comprising the majority of their valley areas. Surisan also extends into western Sanbon-dong.

Gunpo can alternatively be split into its eleven administrative dongs.<ref name="Gunpo history 2" /> Under this system, Sanbon 1-dong, Sanbon 2-dong, Gwangjeong-dong, Gungnae-dong, and Suri-dong replace the legal neighborhood of Sanbon-dong, while Geumjong-dong, Ogeum-dong, and Jaegung-dong fall within the borders of the legal Geumjeong-dong. The administrative neighborhoods of Gunpo 1-dong and Gunpo-2 dong replace the legal Dang-, Dangjeong-, and Bugok-dongs, while the administrative Daeya-dong covers the entirety of four legal dongs: Daeya-, Dundae-, Sokdal-, and Domagyo-dongs.

Gunpo falls at 126 degrees east [[longitude]] and thirty-seven degrees north [[latitude]]. A short distance from the [[Yellow Sea]], it takes on certain features of an oceanic climate. Gunpo receives 1,284&nbsp;mm of precipitation annually and has average January and August temperatures of −3.2 and 26&nbsp;°C, respectively.<ref name="Gunpo introduction" />

===Climate===
Gunpo has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Dwa''), but can be considered a borderline [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Cwa'') using the {{convert|-3|C}} isotherm.

===Tourism===
[[File:Royalazaleashill.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Royal Azaleas Hill in full bloom]]
The night scene of Sanbon's Rodeo Street has been designated by Gunpo as one of its eight famous scenic spots. Also among the eight are Taeeulbong Peak, a 489-meter peak of Surisan; and Surisa Temple, a traditional [[Jogye Order|Jogye Buddhist]] temple also located on Surisan. Destroyed several times throughout its history, Surisa was most recently rebuilt in 1955, and was designated as Korea's eighty-sixth traditional temple in 1988. Bambawi, also known as the chestnut rock, is a low-ridged mountain close to Sanbon New Town and another of the scenic locations.<ref name="Gunpo culture spots" />

Gunpo is home to two small lakes: the Galchi reservoir, located a short walk from Daeyami Station,<ref name="Galchi reservoir">{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/ssori226/220023380716|script-title=ko:갈치저수지 맛집 참고기|access-date=2014-06-09|work=[[Naver Blog]]|date=7 June 2014 <!-- 21:21 --> |author=S.

The sunset over the latter is another of Gunpo's eight famous scenic locations. Rounding out the list are the Dang Forest of the Deokgogae hill, near Daeyami, which won the grand prize at Korea's third National Beautiful Forest Contest; the [[cherry blossom]] path of Gunpo, which decorates an area near Geumjeong Station every spring; and the Royal Azaleas Hill, which annually blooms with 90,000 purple azaleas not long after cherry blossom season.<ref name="Gunpo culture spots" />

Other sightseeing locations in Gunpo include the Nuri Astronomical observatory, located in Daeya-dong's public library,<ref name="Observatory">{{Cite web|url=http://english.gunpo21.net/culture/observatory/culture_observatory_01.jsp|title=Nuri Astronomical observatory|website=Gunpo City|access-date=2014-06-30|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106005649/http://english.gunpo21.net/culture/observatory/culture_observatory_01.jsp|archive-date=6 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> several Buddhist temples,<ref name="Temples">{{Cite web|url=http://english.gunpo21.net/culture/temples/culture_temples_01.jsp|title=Temples|website=Gunpo City|access-date=2014-06-30|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105232110/http://english.gunpo21.net/culture/temples/culture_temples_01.jsp|archive-date=5 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and the Anyang Benest Club, a private eighteen-hole golf course in Bugok-dong open only to members of the Anyang Country Club.<ref name="Golf Course">{{Cite web|url=http://english.gunpo21.net/culture/others/culture_others_01.jsp|title=Reservoirs/Others|website=Gunpo City|access-date=2014-06-30|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120710005749/http://english.gunpo21.net/culture/others/culture_others_01.jsp|archive-date=10 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Hiking Surisan is also a common activity among Gunpo's residents.

==Education==
Gunpo is home to forty-five public schools: twenty-five elementary, twelve middle, seven high, and one university.<ref name="Gunpo overview" /> The latter is [[Hansei University]], a Christian college that offers both undergraduate and graduate programs in various fields of study,<ref name="About Hansei">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hansei.ac.kr/global/en/sub01_01.html|title=About Hansei|website=Hansei University|access-date=2014-07-07|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706090727/http://www.hansei.ac.kr/global/en/sub01_01.html|archive-date=6 July 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> including a [[Korean language]] institute for foreign students both in Korea and abroad.<ref name="Hansei language institute">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hansei.ac.kr/global/en/sub05_02.html|title=Hansei Korean Language Institute|website=Hansei University|access-date=2014-07-07|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222020144/http://www.hansei.ac.kr/global/en/sub05_02.html|archive-date=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Founded in 1953 as the Full Gospel Theological College, the school later changed its name and was accredited as a university in 1993.<ref name="Hansei History">{{Cite web|url=http://www.hansei.ac.kr/global/en/sub01_04.html|title=About Hansei: History|website=Hansei University|access-date=2014-07-07|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327034736/http://www.hansei.ac.kr/global/en/sub01_04.html|archive-date=27 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Transportation==
The [[Gyeongbu Line]], a major South Korean railway line, runs through Gunpo, making stops at [[Geumjeong station|Geumjeong]], [[Gunpo station|Gunpo]], and [[Dangjeong station]]s, all three of which are also stops on [[Seoul Subway Line 1]]. Dangjeong Station services Hansei University and its surrounding downtown. Citizens of Bugok-dong's primary residential and commercial area can easily access [[Uiwang station]]—one stop south of Dangjeong, the station falls within Uiwang's city limits but straddles the Gunpo/Uiwang border. It is similarly a stop on both Seoul Subway Line 1 and the Gyeongbu Line.<ref name="Uiwang Station">{{Cite web|url=http://blog.naver.com/cyd0331/150173356243|script-title=ko:[군포(의왕역)경매 - 근린주택]|access-date=2014-07-08|work=[[Naver Blog]]|date=5 August 2013 <!-- 17:35 --> |language=ko}}</ref>{{Unreliable source|date=March 2024|reason=Self-published blog}}

Geumjeong Station is also a transfer station to [[Seoul Subway Line 4]]. Southwest of it on Line 4 is [[Sanbon station]], which provides access to Sanbon New Town, as well as [[Surisan station|Surisan]] and [[Daeyami Station]]s. On Line 4, a passenger can ride southwest into [[Ansan]] and [[Siheung]] before [[Suin Line|transferring]] to a train for [[Incheon]], or northeast into [[Anyang]], [[Gwacheon]], and [[Seoul]]. Line 1 runs north into Anyang, Seoul, and several cities north of Seoul, or south into Uiwang, [[Suwon]], and beyond.

Two major highways run east–west through Gunpo: the Seouloegwaksunhwan Expressway in the north, and the [[Yeongdong Expressway]] in the south. A number of local buses run frequently in Gunpo, some of which provide rapid service to other cities or to the [[Incheon International Airport]]. Buses and the Seoul Subway can both be ridden using Korea's [[T-money]] metro card. Although there is no inter-city passenger bus terminal in Gunpo, both the Ansan Bus Terminal and the Anyang Bus Terminal are a short distance away. Bugok-dong does house a cargo bus terminal, but local residents banded together in 2003 to oppose its expansion, complaining of the traffic congestion and the air and noise pollution that it produced.<ref name="Cargo terminal">{{Cite web|url=http://gunpo.newsk.kr/bbs/bbs.asp?exe=view&group_name=332&section=1&category=0&idx_num=514&page=748&search_category=&search_word=&order_c=bd_idx_num&order_da=desc|script-title=ko:부곡화물터미널 확장 반대여론 거세|access-date=2014-07-08|work=군포신문|author=이영호|date=21 October 2003 <!-- 17:35 --> |language=ko}}</ref>
