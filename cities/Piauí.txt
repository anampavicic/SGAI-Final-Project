'''Piauí''' ({{IPA|pt-BR|pi.aˈwi|pron}} {{IPA|pt-BR|pjaˈwi|label=or||Pt-br Piauí.ogg}}) is one of the [[states of Brazil]], located in the country's [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeast Region]]. The state has 1.6% of the Brazilian population and produces 0.7% of the Brazilian [[GDP]].

Piauí has the shortest coastline of any coastal Brazilian state at 66&nbsp;km (41&nbsp;mi), and the capital, [[Teresina]], is the only state capital in the northeast to be located inland. The reason for this is, unlike the rest of the area, Piauí was first colonised inland and slowly expanded towards the ocean, rather than the other way around. In the southeast of the state, the [[National Park]] of [[Serra da Capivara National Park|Serra da Capivara]] is a [[UNESCO]] World Heritage Site. The park has more than 400 archaeological sites and the largest concentration of [[rock art|rock paintings]] in the world, in a landscape dominated by [[canyon]]s and [[caatinga]].

== History ==
[[File:Serra_da_Capivara_-_Several_Paintings_2b.jpg|thumb|left|Rock art at [[Serra da Capivara National Park]] in Piauí state, one of the largest and oldest concentrations of prehistoric sites in the Americas]]
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The state has many notable archaeological sites, including Serra de Capivara National Park and [[Sete Cidades National Park]], which are rich in remains of prehistoric [[Paleo-Indian]] and sedentary-based [[Indigenous peoples of Brazil|Indigenous Brazilian]] complex cultures.

Early settlers in the region included Francisco Dias d'Ávila from state of [[Bahia]],<ref>{{Cite web |title=Francisco Dias d'Ávila, devassador do Gurgueia. - Diálogos com a história {{!}} Portal Entretextos |url=https://www.portalentretextos.com.br/post/francisco-dias-davila-devassador-do-gurgueia |access-date=2022-10-13 |website=www.portalentretextos.com.br}}</ref> who brought the first herds of cattle to the area; and [[Domingos Afonso Mafrense]], from [[Portugal]], who founded what is today [[Oeiras, Piauí|Oeiras]].

In the 17th century, many impoverished noblemen and [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priests, as well as black and [[Amerindian]] slaves, settled there. The first large-scale cattle farming also arrived with these settlers. Large estate owners seeking new pastures for their livestock arrived from neighbouring states such as [[Bahia]] and [[Maranhão]].

At the beginning of the 20th century, the principal industry of the state was stock raising, which dates from the first settlement in 1674 by Domingos Afonso Mafrense, who established a number of cattle ranges. A secondary industry was the raising of goats, which were able to stand neglect and a scanty food supply. Agricultural products were cotton, sugar and tobacco. Forest products included rubber, [[carnauba]] wax and [[Caesalpinia echinata|dyewoods]]. Exports included hides, skins, rubber, wax, tobacco and cotton.<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911 |wstitle=Piauhy |volume=21 |page=575 |inline=1}}</ref>

Teresina was the first Brazilian city to be planned. In 1852, an architect designed it, after being inspired by a chessboard. Situated at the confluence of the [[Parnaíba River|Parnaíba]] and [[Poti River]]s, Teresina was (and still is) known as the Green City because of the countless [[mango]] trees that line the city's streets.

==Geography==

[[File:Praia Luís Correia I.jpg|thumb|Luís Correia, Piauí.]]

[[File:Janela_do_Sertão.jpg|thumb|left|Serra das Confusões National Park]]

Piauí is bounded on the west by [[Maranhão]], on the east by [[Ceará]] and [[Pernambuco]], to the west by [[Tocantins]], and to the south by [[Bahia]]. It has a short Atlantic coastline on the north.
[[Image:SERRA_DA_CAPIVARA03.jpg|thumb|[[Caatinga]]]]
The [[Parnaíba River]] forms the boundary with Maranhão throughout its entire length; the state lies almost entirely within the basin of the Parnaíba and its tributaries. Part of the state on the Atlantic coast and along the lower Parnaíba is low, swampy, and historically malarial. South of this the country rises gradually to a plateau with open campos. This plateau region is watered by numerous tributaries of the Parnaíba, chief of which are, from south to north: the [[Poti River|Poti]], which has its source in the state of Ceará; the Longa; the Canindé and its tributary the Piauí, which is navigable for boats of one-meter draft up to [[Nova Iorque]], a few miles above the mouth of the [[Gurguéia River]].<ref name=EB1911/> The river valleys are separated by flat-topped plateaus called ''[[chapada]]s,'' including the Serra Uruçui, which lies between the Uruçui-Preto and the Gurguéia, the [[Serra da Capivara National Park]], which lies between the Gurguéia and the Piauí, and the [[Chapada das Mangabeiras]], which forms the southwestern boundary of the state, separating the upper basin of the Parnaíba from that of the [[Tocantins River|Tocantins]].

===Ecoregions===
The sandy soils along the Atlantic coast are home to the [[Northeastern Brazil restingas]], low evergreen forests adapted to the nutrient-poor conditions. The lower basin of the Parnaíba is home to the [[Maranhão Babaçu forests]], which extend westward into Maranhão. This ecoregion is dominated by stands of the [[Babaçu]] palm.

[[Image:Foz do rio poti visto do parnaiba.jpg|thumb|Parnaíba River in Piauí.]]
The eastern portion of the state is dominated by the dry [[Caatinga]]s shrublands, which extend across much of northeastern Brazil. The [[Cerrado]] savannas extend across the southwestern portion of the state, in the basins of the upper Parnaíba and Gurguéia rivers. Enclaves of [[Atlantic dry forests]] lie in basin of the Gurguéia, forming a transition between the Cerrado and Caatinga. [[Serra da Capivara National Park]] is located in the Caatinga of the south-central part of the state, and protects numerous caves with ancient cave paintings.

===Climate===
The climate is hot and humid in the lowlands and along the lower Parnaíba, but in the uplands it is dry with high day-time temperatures and cool nights.

}}The population of Piauí is mostly [[Christianity|Christian]]. According to the [[IBGE]], it is the state with the lowest proportion of [[Protestants]], and the highest proportion of Catholics in the country. There is a great diversity of religious manifestations in Piauí, expressing the multicultural identity of the Piauí people. According to a survey conducted via an app developed by the [[Municipality]] of [[Teresina]], there are more than 800 adherents of Afro-Brazilian religions in the capital.<ref>[https://www.meionorte.com/noticias/teresina-tem-mais-de-800-terreiros-368237 Teresina tem mais de 800 terreiros]. Portal Meio Norte.</ref> Considering that there are 800 thousand inhabitants in the municipality, there is practically one adherent for every thousand inhabitants. In addition to Christianity and other monotheistic religions, Piauí also has followers of polytheistic spiritualities, such as Piaganismo, who is considered the first neo-pagan religion created in Brazil.<ref>BEZERRA, Karina Oliveira.

There is some mining in the state, including South America's only opal mines at Pedro Segundo. Diamonds are mined by Gema do Piauí Mineração Ltda (Gemapi) and processed in the neighbouring state of Pernambuco in a joint-venture with Gitanjali Group (India). The state has significant deposits of nickel and iron ore. João Carlos Cavalcanti, a mining entrepreneur, and GME4 own the rights to the 800 million tonne PI4 iron ore deposit. A new railway bisecting the state may make this deposit economically viable.<ref>Politics and Economics of the Brazilian State of Piauí website: https://sites.google.com/site/stateofpiaui/economy-of/mining-and-minerals-in-piaui</ref>

==Culture==

===Festa Junina (Saint John Festival)===
[[Festa Junina]] is a cultural festival inspired by Portuguese traditions, in which St John's day, on the June 24, is one of the oldest and most popular celebrations of the year. Unlike the European Midsummer's Day, the festivities in Brazil do not take place at the [[summer solstice]] but during the southern hemisphere's [[winter solstice]]. The festivities traditionally begin after the 12th of June, on the eve of St Anthony's day, and last until the 29th, which is St Peter's day. During these fifteen days, there are bonfires, fireworks, and folk dancing in the streets (step names are in French, which shows the mutual influences between court life and peasant culture in the 17th, 18th, and 19th-century Europe). Once exclusively a rural festival, today in Brazil it is largely a city festival during which people mimic peasant stereotypes and clichés and consume typical refreshments and dishes. As in Carnival, these festivities involve costumes (in this case, peasant garb), dancing, heavy drinking, and visual spectacles (fireworks display and folk dancing). As on Midsummer and St John's Day in Europe, bonfires are a central part of the festivities.{{cn|date=September 2022}}
