==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2007}}

===Pre-modern period===
The area around present-day Yokosuka City has been inhabited for thousands of years. Archaeologists have found stone tools and [[shell midden]]s from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period and ceramic shards from the [[Jomon period|Jōmon]] and [[Kofun period]]s at numerous locations in the area. During the [[Heian period]], local warlord Muraoka Tamemichi established Kinugasa Castle in 1063. He became the ancestor of the [[Miura clan]], which subsequently dominated eastern [[Sagami Province]] for the next several hundred years. The [[Miura clan]] supported [[Minamoto no Yoritomo]] in the foundation of the [[Kamakura shogunate]], but were later annihilated by [[Hōjō Tokiyori]] in 1247. However, the family name was reassigned to a supporter of the [[Hōjō clan]], and the Miura continued to rule [[Miura Peninsula]] through the [[Muromachi period]] until their defeat at Arai Castle in a 1518 attack by [[Hōjō Sōun]]. Following the defeat of the [[Later Hōjō clan]] at the [[Siege of Odawara (1590)|Battle of Odawara]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] transferred [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] to take control over the [[Kantō region]], including Yokosuka in 1590.

The English sailor [[William Adams (samurai)|William Adams]], the first Briton to set foot in Japan, arrived at [[Uraga, Kanagawa|Uraga]] aboard the Dutch trading vessel ''Liefde'' in 1600. In 1612, he was granted the title of [[samurai]] and a fief in Hemi within the boundaries of present-day Yokosuka, due to his services to the [[Tokugawa shogunate]]. A monument to Adams (called ''Miura Anjin'' in Japanese) is a local landmark in Yokosuka.

During the [[Edo period]], Yokosuka ''[[tenryō]]'' territory was controlled directly by the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], but administered through various {{Lang|ja-latn|[[hatamoto]]}}. Due to its strategic location at the entrance to [[Edo Bay|Tokyo Bay]], the Shogunate established the post of Uraga ''Bugyō'' in 1720, and all shipping into the bay was required to stop for inspection. As concerns over the increasing number of incursions by foreign vessels and attempts to end Japan's self-imposed [[sakoku|national seclusion policy]], the Shogunate established a number of [[coastal artillery]] batteries around Yokosuka, including an outpost at Ōtsu in 1842. However, despite these efforts, in 1853, United States naval [[Commodore (United States)|Commodore]] [[Matthew Perry (naval officer)|Matthew Perry]] arrived in Tokyo Bay with his fleet of [[Black Ships]] and came ashore at Kurihama, in southern Yokosuka, leading to the opening of diplomatic and trade relations between Japan and the United States. The [[Japanese warship Kanrin Maru|''Kanrin Maru'']] sailed from Yokosuka in 1860 with the [[Japanese Embassy to the United States (1860)|first Japanese diplomatic embassy to the United States]] in 1860.

[[File:YokosukaConstruction.jpg|thumb|600px|Construction of the Yokosuka arsenal {{circa|1870}}]]

During the turbulent [[Bakumatsu period]], the Shogunate selected Yokosuka as the site for a modern naval base, and hired the [[oyatoi gaikokujin|French engineer]] [[Léonce Verny]] in 1865 to oversee the development of [[shipbuilding]] facilities, beginning with Yokosuka Iron Foundry. [[Yokosuka Naval Arsenal]] became the first modern [[arsenal]] to be created in Japan. The construction of the arsenal was the central point of a global modern infrastructure, that was to prove an important first step for the modernization of Japan's industry. Modern buildings, the Hashirimizu waterway, foundries, brick factories, and technical schools to train Japanese technicians were established.

===Meiji period to present===
{{update|section|date=February 2024}}
After the [[Meiji Restoration]], the arsenal was taken over by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]], and the area of modern Yokosuka was reorganized into Uraga Town and numerous villages within [[Miura District, Kanagawa|Miura District]], [[Kanagawa Prefecture]]. Yokosuka Village was elevated to town status in 1878 and was made the capital of Miura District. In 1889, the [[Yokosuka Line]] railway was opened, connecting Yokosuka to Yokohama and Tokyo. Yokosuka was elevated to city status on February 15, 1907. From 1916, Oppama in Yokosuka was developed as the [[Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal]], and many of the combat aircraft subsequently operated by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]] were developed or tested at Yokosuka. Yokosuka Naval Arsenal also continued to expand in the early 20th century, and its production included [[battleship]]s such as [[Japanese battleship Yamashiro|''Yamashiro'']], and [[aircraft carrier]]s such as [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryū|''Hiryū'']] and [[Japanese aircraft carrier Shōkaku|''Shōkaku'']]. Smaller warships were constructed at the privately owned [[Uraga Dock Company]]. [[Yokosuka Naval District]] was the home port of the [[IJN 1st Fleet]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

The [[1923 Great Kanto earthquake|Great Kantō earthquake]] of 1923 caused severe damage to Yokosuka, including the naval base which lost two years' operations of oil supplies. The city continued to expand in 1933 with the annexation of neighboring Kinugasa Village and Taura Town in 1933 and Kurihama Village in 1937. In 1943, the city also annexed the neighboring towns and villages of Uraga, Kitashitaura, Okusu, Nagai and Takeyama, as well as [[Zushi, Kanagawa|Zushi]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

During [[World War II]], Yokosuka was bombed on April 18, 1942, by American [[B-25 Mitchell|B-25 bombers]] in the [[Doolittle Raid]] with little damage as a retaliation to the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]]. Aside from minor sporadic tactical air raids by [[United States Navy]] aircraft, it was not bombed again during the war; however, from 1938 to 1945 more than 260 caves in more than 20 separate tunnel/cave networks were built throughout the area, with at least 27 kilometers of known tunnels within the grounds of Yokosuka Naval Base. Many more tunnels are scattered throughout the surrounding areas. During the war, these tunnels and caves provided areas in which work could be done in secrecy, safe from air attacks. A 500-bed hospital, a large electrical power generating facility, and a midget submarine factory and warehouse were among the many facilities built. American occupation forces landed at Yokosuka on August 30, 1945, after the [[surrender of Japan]], and the naval base has been used by the US Navy since that time.  The caves were used for storage and as an emergency shelter during the Korean War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stripes.com/news/yokosuka-cave-network-dug-by-japanese-during-world-war-ii-sealed-1.30229|title=Yokosuka cave network dug by Japanese during World War II sealed|website=Stripes.com|access-date=August 21, 2017}}</ref>

From the 1950s, [[United States Fleet Activities Yokosuka]] has been home port for the [[United States Seventh Fleet]], and played a critical support role in the [[Korean War]] and the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnic.navy.mil/regions/cnrj/installations/cfa_yokosuka/about/history.html|title=history.html|website=Navy.mil|access-date=August 21, 2017}}</ref> Yokosuka was the site of many anti-war protests during the late 1960s and 1970s. The nuclear-powered [[USS George Washington (CVN-73)|USS ''George Washington'']], formerly based at Yokosuka, was the first U.S. nuclear-powered ship that had been permanently based in Japan. The [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] also operates a military port next to the American base, as well as numerous training facilities at scattered locations around the city. For those reasons, there are a few hundred Americans and a thousand Filipinos in Yokosuka.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp/1210/data/t-k-syo/documents/26002.xls|title=Demographics of Yokosuka|date=April 13, 2018|access-date=April 13, 2018|archive-date=April 14, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414010941/https://www.city.yokosuka.kanagawa.jp/1210/data/t-k-syo/documents/26002.xls|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==Energy disasters==
On 26 October 2011 Yokosuka held its annual nuclear accident evacuation drill. This drill was first held in 2008 when the nuclear-powered aircraft carrier [[USS George Washington (CVN-73)|USS ''George Washington'']] was employed at the US naval base near this city. About 70 people, residents and firefighters took part in the drill. Firefighters ordered the residents of the city to stay indoors, assuming abnormally high levels of radiation around the US base. Radioactive contamination was controlled in the emergency response center by city officials. The US Navy refused to take part this, because of the supposed impossibility of radiation leaking outside the base. {{citation needed|date=April 2019}} In December 2011, another drill was scheduled with Yokosuka and other cities to prepare for the possibility that people on board the ship might be exposed to radiation.<ref>NHK-world (26 October 2011)[http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/26_23.html Yokosuka conducts nuclear accident drill] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511115126/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/26_23.html |date=May 11, 2011 }}</ref>

One unintended consequence of anti-nuclear sentiment is the construction of coal fired power plants, which causes [[air pollution]] and worsens [[global warming]].

These [[Coal-fired power station|coal-fired power plants]] are being built without a full environmental review, and local residents are suing the government of Japan over its construction.
