'''Conservation History '''
    
The visit of [[Sir D.B. Brandis]] in 1860 to the area culminated in a {{convert|303|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} forest area of the present day Dudhwa National Park being brought under the control of Government in 1861 for preservation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projecttiger.nic.in/dudhwa.htm |title=Dudhwa Tiger Reserve-Project Tiger |access-date=15 April 2017 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040510030350/http://projecttiger.nic.in/dudhwa.htm |archive-date=10 May 2004 }}</ref> 
In Kheri District all the Sal and miscellaneous forests and grasslands in Khairigarh Pargana, between the [[Mohana River|Mohana]] and [[Suheli River|Suheli]] rivers, were included in the then North Kheri Forest Division. More areas were reserved for protection between 1867 and 1879 and added to the Division. The area of the Division was legally constituted as Reserved Forests in 1937.
[[File:Sharda Dam.jpg|thumb|right|Sharda River]]
The Sonaripur Sanctuary, comprising 15.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>, was created in 1958 to specifically protect swamp deer (Cervus duvaceli duvaceli). The area was too small and was later enlarged to 212&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and renamed as Dudhwa Sanctuary in 1968. Later, more area was added to the Sanctuary and in 1977, it was declared Dudhwa National Park. The total area of the Park was 616&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> of which 490&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> was the core zone and the balance of 124&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> was a buffer zone.

The area was established in 1958 as a wildlife sanctuary. On 1 February 1977 wildlife sanctuary became a national park and after 11 years, in 1988, largely due to the efforts of [[Billy Arjan Singh]] it was established as a tiger reserve. Dudhwa Tiger Reserve lies on the India-Nepal border in the foothills of the Himalaya. Dudhwa Tiger Reserve was created in the year 1987–88 comprising Dudhwa National Park and Kishanpur Sanctuary (203.41&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>). With an addition of 66&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> to the buffer zone in 1997, the present area of the Tiger Reserve is 884&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. Distance from Lakhimpur railway station to Dudhwa is about 100&nbsp;km by road.
'''Sharda Dam''' and '''Deer Park''' are other major attractions of Lakhimpur.

It is the belief of the people that Lord Shiva was pleased with the penance (Tapasya) of Rawana (King of Lanka) and offered him a boon. Rawana requested the Lord Shiva to go to Lanka with him and leave Himalaya forever. The Lord Shiva agreed to go on condition that he should not be placed anywhere on the way to Lanka. If he were placed anywhere, he would settle at that place. Rawana agreed and started his journey to Lanka with the Lord on his head. When Rawana reached the Gola Gokaran Nath (then called Gollihara) he felt the need to urinate (a call of nature). Rawana offered some gold coins to a shepherd (who was none other than Lord Ganesha sent by deities) for placing the Lord Shiva on his head until he returned. The shepherd (Lord Ganesha) placed him on the land. Rawana failed to lift him up despite all his efforts. He pressed him on his head with his thumb in full anger. The impression of Rawana's thumb is still present on the Shivling. In the month of Chatra (April) a great fair is organised for one month known as ''Cheti-Mela''.
