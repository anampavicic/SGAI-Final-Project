== History ==
Ikeja, which was formally called "Akeja", was named after a deity of the [[Awori tribe|Awori]] people of Ota.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Peters|first=Ifeoma|date=8 June 2017|title=The origin of the word "Ikeja"|work=DNL legal & style blog|url=https://dnllegalandstyle.com/2017/lagos-based-lawyer-tanimola-anjorin-unravels-origin-word-ikeja/|access-date=24 September 2020|archive-date=6 December 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211206171556/https://dnllegalandstyle.com/2017/lagos-based-lawyer-tanimola-anjorin-unravels-origin-word-ikeja/|url-status=dead}}</ref> It was originally settled by the Awori people, and the area was raided for slaves until the mid-19th century.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ikeja City Towns in Lagos Nigeria Guide |url=https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Nigeria/States_Nigeria/Lagos/History-of-Ikeja-in-Lagos.html |access-date=2023-07-14 |website=www.nigeriagalleria.com}}</ref> Early in the 20th century, it became an agricultural hinterland for Lagos. The opening of the Lagos-Ibadan railway in 1901 and the growth of Lagos as a port transformed Ikeja into a residential and industrial suburb of that city.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Ikeja City Towns in Lagos Nigeria Guide |url=https://www.nigeriagalleria.com/Nigeria/States_Nigeria/Lagos/History-of-Ikeja-in-Lagos.html |access-date=2023-07-14 |website=www.nigeriagalleria.com}}</ref> In the mid-1960s an industrial estate was established, and in 1976 Ikeja became the capital of Lagos state.<ref>{{Cite web |last= |date=January 14, 2015 |title=Ikeja |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Ikeja |access-date=January 10, 2018 |website=Encyclopædia Britannica}}</ref> [[Johnson Solanke Tomori]] was an important in the history of Ikeja. He contributed to all the socio-cultural aspects of Ikeja, Agidingbi, Oregun, Alausa, Ojodu, and all the suburbs of Ikeja. His contributions date back to 1965, when he brought a higher level of social consciousness to Ikeja.

=== Television studios ===
Ikeja is home to Nigeria's most important television studios, such as Channels TV and African Independent TV, as well as associated advertising agencies.

=== Computer Village ===
Ikeja is home to a large computer [[Market (place)|market]], popularly known as Otigba. Begun in 1997 as a small market of only 10 shops, the current market now has well over 3000. While most vendors provide the expected computer sales and repair services, it is also possible to find sales and repair services for various types of [[office equipment]] and electronic devices.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Computer Village: what you probably didn't know about Africa's biggest gadget market |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/metro/computer-village-what-you-probably-didnt-know-about-africas-biggest-gadget-market/2wytc4w |work=Pulse Nigeria}}</ref>

By 2019, the little shops at Computer Village had grown to multiple-storey shopping malls. Many of the single-floor buildings have been developed into larger buildings, housing several shops that distribute and repair mobile phones, laptops, printers and other electronic devices. Nearly all the major Nigerian banks have branches around the market.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

As the market is unplanned, it has experienced difficulties in its growth, with some local residents expressing frustration at the market's expansion. Traffic around the area has become very congested, and it can be almost impossible to find a place to park. Furthermore, the electrical infrastructure, which was already unreliable, has become overloaded by the new market, which requires significant amounts of electricity to demonstrate working computer products to potential customers.<ref>[http://www.nigeriabusinessinfo.com/computer-village2002.htm Focus on the Ikeja Computer Village, Lagos] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920172802/http://www.nigeriabusinessinfo.com/computer-village2002.htm|date=20 September 2007}}, NigeriaBusinessInfo.com, 2 September 2002.

=== Brewery ===
[[File:Guinness Malta.jpg|thumb|"Malt-based soft drink" from Ikeja]]
The Guinness brewery produces its famous beer in Ikeja. Apparently, the average Nigerian drinks larger quantities of this beverage than the average Irishman.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-30 |title=Which African Nation Consumes more Guinness than Ireland? - livingireland.com |url=https://livingireland.com/which-african-nation-consumes-more-guinness-than-ireland/ |access-date=2024-01-14 |website=livingireland.com |language=en-US}}</ref> The brewery also produces non-alcoholic and halal malt beer, which is part of the "Lagos' way of life".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Humphery |date=2024-01-07 |title=Most Popular Malt Brands and Their Manufacturers in Nigeria |url=https://nyscinfo.com/most-popular-malt-brands-and-their-manufacturers-in-nigeria/ |access-date=2024-01-14 |website=Nyscinfo |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== Pharmaceutical industry ===
60% of West Africa's pharmaceutical production takes place in Nigeria.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Egwuatu |first=Peter |date=2023-04-04 |title=Nigeria dominates 60% of pharmaceutical production in ECOWAS |url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/04/nigeria-dominates-60-of-pharmaceutical-production-in-ecowas/ |website=Vanguard}}</ref> The majority of Nigerian pharmaceutical manufacturers have their main production site in Ikeja. This includes May & Baker, one of the three largest manufacturers of medicines.

=== Diverse ===
A slum in Ikeja was selected by [[C. J. Obasi]] as a [[Filmmaking#Production|production]] location for the 2014 [[Nollywood]] thriller, [[Ojuju]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nolly.com.ng/notices/audition-for-thriller-movie |title=Audition for thriller movie &#124; Nolly |access-date=1 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903135517/http://nolly.com.ng/notices/audition-for-thriller-movie |archive-date=3 September 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>

Ikeja also has a main market area called Oba Momodu Illo (Obada) market in Ipodo. This market contains many shops and makeshift stalls where merchants display and sell produce, meat, fish, grains, and other groceries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Shops |url=https://www.ferrybuildingmarketplace.com/shops/ |access-date=2023-07-11 |website=Ferry Building Marketplace |language=en-US}}</ref>

== Tourism ==

=== Museums ===
[[File:Kalakuta Queens.jpg|thumb|Kalakuta Museum]]
The ''Kalakuta Museum'' commemorates the late musician [[Fela Kuti]], who probably had a formative role in Nigeria's music world comparable to that of [[Bob Marley]] in [[Jamaica]]. The building was the musician's second home in Lagos after soldiers burnt down his first home in Surulere in February 1977, raped female family members and injured Kuti's mother, a respected trade union leader, so badly that she died as a result. Kuti built a new house in Ikeja, but it fell into disrepair after his death and had to be renovated as a museum in 2012. Kuti's grave is located next to the museum. Inside the museum, the walls are covered with historical photos, posters, paintings, murals, record covers and newspaper cuttings. Some of Fela's musical instruments are on display, including his colourfully painted, distinctive tenor saxophone. Fela's shoes and shirts are on display in rows, as are stage suits and the fur coat he wore on tour in Europe and the USA. There is a rooftop café, and visitors can stay overnight in one of several air-conditioned rooms with en-suite bathrooms.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kalakuta Museum |url=https://felakuti.com/legacy/kalakuta-museum |access-date=2024-01-14 |website=Fela Kuti |language=en}}</ref>

=== Parks and squares ===
[[File:Jhalobia Park 10.jpg|thumb|Jhalobia Recreation Park]]
''Jhalobia Recreation Park and Gardens'' is owned by a certain Mrs Veronica Adepoju and her two daughters - three trained landscape designers who display everything their art has to offer on just under one hectare.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Home - Jhalobia Botanical Garden and Recreation Park |url=https://jhalobia.com/ |access-date=2024-01-14 |language=en-US}}</ref> The place is very photogenic and is therefore regularly booked for weddings and other festivities. In between such events, Jhalobia is praised as an island of tranquillity in the midst of the hustle and bustle of Lagos.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jhalobia Recreation Park and Gardens, Lagos - Parks in Ikeja |url=https://www.cometonigeria.com/where-to-go/jhalobia-recreation-park-gardens/ |access-date=2024-01-14 |website=www.cometonigeria.com}}</ref>

=== Music pub ===
[[File:New Afrika Shrine.jpg|thumb|New Afrika Shrine]]
Contrary to what the name suggests, the ''New Afrika Shrine'' in Ikeja is not a shrine,<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=The New Afrika Shrine |url=https://felakuti.com/legacy/new-afrika-shrine |access-date=2024-01-14 |website=Fela Kuti |language=en}}</ref> but a music bar run by the descendants of [[Fela Kuti]]. It unfolds its special charm when live music is playing; it is also the only place in Lagos where you can legally smoke a joint.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sesan |date=2020-02-17 |title=Fela's spirit gaining more converts at New Afrika Shrine |url=https://punchng.com/felas-spirit-gaining-more-converts-at-new-afrika-shrine/ |access-date=2024-01-14 |website=Punch Newspapers |language=en-US}}</ref> The Afrika Shrine was Fela's second home until a few weeks before his death in 1997, after which it fell into disrepair. The New Afrika Shrine, opened in 2000, was built by his family under the direction of his eldest daughter Yeni and eldest son Femi. Their main concern was to honour and preserve the contribution Fela and the Shrine have made to the local community and the overall development of post-colonial Africa. Most events at the New Afrika Shrine are free of charge. Femi performs with his band The Positive Force every Thursday and Sunday when he is not on tour. His younger brother Seun performs with Egypt 80 every last Saturday of the month. The new club is four times the size of the original Shrine and seats two and a half thousand people. Overheads are covered by the sale of food, drinks and merchandise. Admission is usually 500 naira, half a US dollar. The club has a small library, pool tables and chill-out areas and organises educational and outreach activities.<ref name=":1" />

==Climate==
It has a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. The majority of the year's months get heavy rainfall. The brief dry season has very little impact on the climate as a whole.
