==History==
[[File:Mihirakula Coin.jpg|300px|thumb|Coin of the [[Alchon Huns]] king [[Mihirakula]], who ruled in Gwalior circa 520 CE.|left]]
According to legend, Gwalior was founded in 600 CE after a local chieftain, [[Suraj Sen]], who was cured of leprosy from a drink given to him by a holy man called Gwalipa. Suraj subsequently set up a town and fort and named them after Gwalipa.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |title=International Dictionary of Historic Places, Volume 5: Asia and Oceania |publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn Publishers |year=1996 |isbn=1-884964-04-4 |editor-last=Schellinger |editor-first=Paul |location=Chicago |pages=312 |editor-last2=Salkin |editor-first2=Robert }}</ref>

The earliest historical record found at Gwalior is the [[Gwalior inscription of Mihirakula|Gwalior inscription]] of the [[Alchon Huns|Alchon Hun]] ruler [[Mihirakula]]. It describes Mihirakula's father [[Toramana]] (493–515) as "a ruler of the earth, of great merit, who was renowned by the name of the glorious Tôramâna; by whom, through (his) heroism that was specially characterized by truthfulness, the earth was governed with justice", and his Mihirakula as "the lord of the earth" as of 520 CE.

Around the 9th century, the [[Gurjara-Pratihara dynasty]] controlled Gwalior and during their rule, they constructed the [[Teli ka Mandir]] temple. The [[Kachchhapaghata dynasty]] ruled the area c.950 –c.1192 CE, leaving remarkable architectural works such as the [[Sasbahu Temple, Gwalior|Sasbahu Temples]]. In 1021, Gwalior was attacked by forces led by [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Mahmud Ghazni]].<ref name=":0" />

In 1231 [[Iltutmish]], ruler of the [[Mamluk dynasty (Delhi)|Mamluk dynasty]] of the [[Delhi Sultanate]], captured Gwalior after an 11-month-long effort and from then till the 13th century it remained under Muslim rule. In 1375, Raja Veer Singh was made the ruler of Gwalior and he founded the rule of the [[Tomaras of Gwalior|Tomar]] clan. During those years, Gwalior saw its golden period.[[File:Jain statues, Gwalior.jpg|thumb|Jain statues at [[Siddhachal Caves]] inside Gwalior Fort.|left]]The Jain Sculptures at [[Gwalior Fort]] were built under Tomar rule.

=== Rebellion of 1857 ===
Gwalior was major centre in the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857|1857 rebellion]], mainly because of [[Rani Lakshmibai]]. After Kalpi (Jhansi) fell into the hands of the British on 24 May 1858, Lakshmibai sought shelter at Gwalior Fort. The Maharaja of Gwalior, was not willing to give up his fort without a fight as he was a strong ally of the British, but after negotiations, his troops capitulated and the rebels took possession of the fort. The British attacked Gwalior in no time, the battle was fought by Lakshmibai.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sanskritimagazine.com/history/rani-lakshmibai-remembering-valiant-queen-jhansi/# |title=Rani Lakshmibai: Remembering the valiant queen of Jhansi |work=Sanskriti – Indian Culture |access-date=28 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150716053211/http://www.sanskritimagazine.com/history/rani-lakshmibai-remembering-valiant-queen-jhansi/ |archive-date=16 July 2015 |url-status=live |date=19 November 2014 }}</ref> Indian forces numbered around 20,000, and British forces around 1,600 troops.

Gwalior was merged with a number of other princely states to become the new Indian state of Madhya Bharat. Jivajirao Scindia served as the state's [[Rajpramukh]], or the appointed governor, from 28 May 1948 to 31 October 1956, when Madhya Bharat was merged into Madhya Pradesh.[[File:Gwalior Twelve Annas King George VI SG137.jpg|thumb|A King George VI stamp of 1949, inscribed 'GWALIOR']]

'''Art and Literature'''

In more recent times, Akhtar family has been based out of Gwalior for at least three generations with [[Muztar Khairabadi]], his son [[Jan Nisar Akhtar]] and his grandson [[Javed Akhtar]] being the prominent literary figures. [[Nida Fazli]], one of the most famous Indian Hindi and Urdu poets grew up here. Former Indian Prime Minister, [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], is also a well known writer and poet.

===Music===
Raja Man Singh Tomar, the King of Gwalior between 1486 and 1516 CE, was a patron of [[Dhrupad|Drupad]] (Hindi: ध्रुपद). Dhrupad is a vocal genre in Hindustani classical music, said to be the oldest still-in-use in that musical tradition. Its name is derived from the words "dhruva" (fixed) and "pada" (words). The term may denote both the verse form of the poetry and the style in which it is sung.

[[File:Tomb of Tansen.jpg|thumb|Tomb of Tansen]]
Gwalior holds a major position in the Indian classical music, with being the birthplace of the oldest Hindustani sangeet [[gharana]] – [[Gwalior Gharana]]. Gwalior holds an unparalleled reputation in [[Sangeet (music)|Sangeet]] and has retained Indian traditions and the wealth of music intact over the years. The Gwalior Gharana is not only the oldest Khyal [[Gharana]] but it is also one of the most prominent [[gharana]] being the one to which most classical Indian musicians can trace the origin of their style. The rise of the Gwalior Gharana started with the reign of the great Mughal emperor [[Akbar]] (1542–1605). Akbar's favourite singer was Tansen, who came from the Gwalior area and whose ashes were buried in Gwalior after his death. The Tansen Tomb in Gwalior was constructed in his remembrance. [[Tansen Samaroh|Tansen Festival]] started in the 1930s, and currently artists from all over India come to perform in the festival.

Baijnath Prasad (also known as [[Baiju Bawra]]) was a classical singer (Dhrupadiya) who lived in Gwalior for his whole life under the patronage of Man Singh. Baiju was born in Chanderi and was cremated there. He received his musical training in Vrindaban under Swami Guru Haridas Ji. He was the court musician of Gwalior along with Nayak Charju, Bakshu, and others.

[[Sarod]] player [[Amjad Ali Khan]] is also from Gwalior. His grandfather, Ghulam Ali Khan Bangash, became a court musician in Gwalior.

The old town of Gwalior, commonly called Kila Gate is around {{convert|1|km}} from Hazira, the largest area in old town, which is of considerable size but irregularly built. It lies at the eastern base of the rock and contains the tomb of the [[Sufi]] saints, [[Khwaja Khanoon]] and [[Muhammad Ghaus]], erected during the early part of Mughal emperor [[Akbar]]'s reign, and the tomb of [[Tansen|Mian Tansen]], a great singer and one of the 'Nine Jewels' of Akbar's court. A town called by his name ''Ghauspura'' situated near the tomb of Mohaommed Ghaus.reold town consisted of some streets and mohallas which are presumed to be 700 to 800 yrs old areas in gwalior which are still backward areas in gwalior due to improper management of new town. these old areas are as follows.

* Koteshwar Temple. This temple is a 700-year-old temple of Lord Shiva whose [[shivling]] was on Gwalior Fort, but when the Mughals conquered it they ordered the shivling thrown out. When the troops did that, the shivling was automatically established in a field below the fort without any harm. Muslim Gazi told the emperor not to harm the shivling. In the late 18th century Scindias built a temple for that shivling, now known as Koteshwar Mahadev.
* Baba Kapoor- this place is 500 meters away from Ghas Mandi. This place was named Baba Kapoor because of saint Shah Abdul Gafoor.
* Kashi Naresh ki gali- this a 600-year-old residential street in Gwalior it was given name as Kashi Naresh ki gali because in the 14th century when the emperor of Kashi was defeated in war he was sent to exile by oppositions at that time Gwalior emperor and Kashi's emperor were good friends when Kashi's emperor told Gwalior's emperor whole story, emperor gave him an entire street for living at that time which is now known as Kashi Naresh ki Gali. their family even now resides there in Kashi Naresh ki gali in Rajaji Ka Bada.

[[File:Gwalior fort front side view.JPG|thumb|left|Gwalior fort front side view]]

At the heart of Gwalior is Gwalior Fort of the [[Tomaras of Gwalior|Tomara dynasty]]. This structure was reputed to be one of the most structurally sound forts of India, having been improved by Raja [[Man Singh Tomar]] where a previous structure existed. It occupies an isolated rock outcrop. The hill is steepened to make it virtually unscalable and is surrounded by high walls which enclose buildings from several periods. The old town of Gwalior lies at the eastern base of the fortress. Lashkar, founded by Daulat Rao Scindia, formerly a separate town that originated as a military camp, lies to the south, and Morar, also a formerly separate town, lies to the east. Gwalior, Lashkar and Morar are part of the Gwalior Municipal Corporation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gwaliormunicipalcorporation.org/gwalior_municipal_corporation_history.aspx |title=Gwalior Municipal Corporation History |website=Gwaliormunicipalcorporation.org |date=1 July 1912 |access-date=13 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618141555/http://gwaliormunicipalcorporation.org/gwalior_municipal_corporation_history.aspx |archive-date=18 June 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref>

The Fort, popularly called "the Gibraltar of India", overlooks the city. The Emperor [[Babur]] reputedly described it as "the pearl in the necklace of the forts of Hind". This fort's architecture is unique. It displays a Chinese influence on Indian architecture, as Chinese dragons have been crafted at the hilt of the pillars. This influence was due to trade between China and India at the time of the fort's construction.

After the death of [[Sher Shah Suri]] in 1545, who was ruling North India at that time, his son [[Islam Shah]] shifted his capital from Delhi to Gwalior and constructed 'Sher Shah Mandir' (or 'Sher Shah Fort') in his father's memory. Islam Shah operated from Gwalior until his death in 1553. Islam Shah had appointed the Hindu warrior '[[Hemu]]' or [[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]] as his Prime Minister in Sher Shah Fort for the first time, who later on became the [[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]] king at Delhi and established 'Hindu Raj' in North India.

In the east of the city are two examples of early [[Mughal architecture]]: the mausoleum of the 16th century [[Sufi]] Saint Ghous Mohammed and the tomb of Mian Tansen, a singer and one of the 'Nine Jewels' of the [[Mughal Emperor]] [[Akbar]]'s court. Right next to them is the Gujari Mahal, built by Tomar Rajput King Man Singh Tomar on demand of his consort Gujar princess Mrignayani.<ref>{{cite book |title=Census of India, 1961, Volume 14, Issue 5 |author=India (Republic) Office of the Registrar General |publisher=Manager of Publications |year=1972 |page=11 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.google.com.pk/imgres?q=akbarnama&hl=en&biw=1024&bih=673&tbm=isch&tbnid=ixyEuEoV-Vu96M:&imgrefurl=http://www.superstock.com/stock-photos-images/475-638&docid=So7hrNVbFmZpHM&w=212&h=350&ei=VIiFTrXVPMPf4QTGspWHDw&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=244&vpy=281&dur=9662&hovh=280&hovw=169&tx=97&ty=205&page=3&tbnh=133&tbnw=82&start=41&ndsp=21&ved=1t:429,r:15,s:4 |title=Archived copy |access-date=30 September 2011 |archive-date=18 October 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20231018034045/http://www.google.com.pk/imgres?q=akbarnama&hl=en&biw=1024&bih=673&tbm=isch&tbnid=ixyEuEoV-Vu96M:&imgrefurl=http://www.superstock.com/stock-photos-images/475-638&docid=So7hrNVbFmZpHM&w=212&h=350&ei=VIiFTrXVPMPf4QTGspWHDw&zoom=1&iact=hc&vpx=244&vpy=281&dur=9662&hovh=280&hovw=169&tx=97&ty=205&page=3&tbnh=133&tbnw=82&start=41&ndsp=21&ved=1t:429,r:15,s:4 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
Close to the heart of the city is [[Jai Vilas Mahal|Jai Vilas Palace]] of the Scindia dynasty, patterned on the [[palace of Versailles]]. It combines Tuscan, Italian and Corinthian styles of architecture.
Historically and architecturally, Gwalior is interesting first as an ancient seat of [[Jainism|Jain]] worship; second for its example of palace architecture of the [[Hindu]] period between 1486 and 1516; and third as an historic fortress. Many historical places are found near the [[Dabra]]-[[Bhitarwar]] Road. Prior to the founding of Gwalior, the region was also known by its ancient name of ''Gopasetra''. Gwalior had an institutional seat of the [[Bhattaraka]]s of [[Kashtha Sangh]] and later [[Mula Sangh]].

There is a series of 26 Jain statues in a single line. Built between 1398 and 1536 by Tomar kings, these Jain ''[[Tirthankar]]'' statues are one of a kind in architecture.

=== Siddhachal Caves ===
{{Main|Siddhachal Caves}}

Jain rock-cut sculptures of Siddhachal Caves – A striking part of the [[Jain]] remains at Gwalior is a series of caves or rock-cut sculptures, excavated in the rock on all sides, and numbering nearly a hundred, great and small. Most of them are mere niches to hold statues, though some are cells that may have been originally intended for residences. According to inscriptions, they were all excavated within a short period of about thirty-three years, between 1441 and 1474.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/madhya-pradesh-and-chhattisgarh/gwalior/sights/other/jain-rock-sculptures |title=Jain Rock Sculptures |author=Lonely Planet |work=Lonely Planet |access-date=28 July 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304073000/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/india/madhya-pradesh-and-chhattisgarh/gwalior/sights/other/jain-rock-sculptures |archive-date=4 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> One of the colossal figures is {{cvt|57|ft|m}} high, taller than any other in northern India.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

{{Main|Teli ka Mandir}}
[[File:Teli ka Mandir (15699755834)2.jpg|thumb|Teli-ka-Mandir]]

Teli Temple or in Hindi Teli Ka Mandir – A structure of about 100 feet, Teli Ka Mandir in Gwalior Fort distinguishes itself from the other compositions of its time because of its unique architecture. The temple bears a close resemblance to the temple of Prathihara Vishnu, and is filled with images of coiled serpents, passionate couples, river goddesses, and a flying [[Garuda]]. The temple architecture follows the Indo-Aryan and Nagara styles and is believed to be among the oldest constructions in the fort. The Telikā Mandir, or 'oil-man's temple', owes its name to Teli, a term for an oil grinder or oil dealer. Many suggestions have been put forward to explain this name historically, but in fact the name is not old, the temple being used for processing oil before the British occupied the fort and used the building, albeit temporarily, as a coffee shop. The Telikā Mandir is the loftiest temple among all the buildings in Gwalior Fort with a height of about 30 meters. The temple consists of a ''[[garba griha]]'', that is, sanctum proper for the deity, and an ''[[antarala]]'' to enter into the temple. It can be approached by a flight of steps provided on the eastern side. The most striking feature of the temple is the wagon-vaulted roof, a form used over rectangular shrines which normally accommodated a row of Mother Goddesses.<ref>M. Willis, ''Temples of Gopakṣetra: A Regional History of Architecture in Central India'' (London, 1996).</ref> The goddesses from the interior vanished centuries ago and have not been traced. The exterior walls of the temple are decorated with sculptures, many of which are damaged; the niches, shaped like temples, are empty. The building carries a dedicatory inscription to the goddess in a niche on the southern side, but otherwise does not have any history.<ref>Willis, ''Inscriptions of Gopakṣetra: Materials for the History of Central India'' (London, 1995), illustration.</ref> The architectural style points to a date in the late 8th Century.<ref>Willis, ''Temples of Gopakṣetra''.</ref> The entrance gateway on the eastern side is a later addition of the British period, made by Major Keith in 1881. It was built as a way of saving various historic pillars and other pieces no longer in their original context.

The outer structure of Gujari Mahal has survived in an almost total state of preservation; the interior has been converted into an archaeological museum housing rare antiquities, some of them dating back to the 1st century A.D. Many of these have been defaced by the [[iconoclastic]] Mughals.
