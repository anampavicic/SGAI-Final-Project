== Etymology ==
The origins of the name Dhaka are uncertain.

At the end of the [[Karrani Dynasty]] (1564–1575), the nobles of [[Bengal]] became fiercely independent. [[Sulaiman Khan Karrani]] carved out an independent principality in the Bhati region comprising a part of greater [[Dhaka district]] and parts of [[Mymensingh district]]. During that period [[Taj Khan Karrani]] and another Afghan chieftain helped [[Isa Khan]] to obtain an estate in [[Sonargaon]] and [[Mymensingh]] in 1564. By winning the grace of the Afghan chieftain, Isa Khan gradually increased his strength and status and by 1571, the Mughal Court designated him as the ruler of Bhati.<ref>{{cite news |title=A tale of Baro-Bhuiyans |url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=239574:a-tale-of-baro-bhuiyans&catid=175:weekend-independent&Itemid=213 |newspaper=The Independent |location=Dhaka |date=5 December 2014 |access-date=1 February 2015}}</ref> Mughal histories, mainly the ''[[Akbarnama]]'', the ''[[Ain-i-Akbari]]'' and the ''[[Baharistan-i-Ghaibi]]'' refers to the low-lying regions of Bengal as ''Bhati.''

Dhaka became the capital of the Mughal province of Bengal, Bihar, and Orissa in 1610 with a jurisdiction covering modern-day Bangladesh and [[east India|eastern India]], including the modern-day [[Indian state]]s of [[West Bengal]], [[Bihar]] and [[Orissa]]. This province was known as [[Bengal Subah]]. The city was founded during the reign of [[Jahangir|Emperor Jahangir]]. Emperor [[Shah Jahan]] visited Dhaka in 1624 and stayed in the city for a week, four years before he became emperor in 1628.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.thedailystar.net/my-dhaka/news/shah-jahans-dhaka-visit-he-became-the-mughal-emperor-3413231 | title=Shah Jahan's Dhaka visit before he became the Mughal emperor | date=7 September 2023 | access-date=8 September 2023 | archive-date=8 September 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230908153928/https://www.thedailystar.net/my-dhaka/news/shah-jahans-dhaka-visit-he-became-the-mughal-emperor-3413231 | url-status=live }}</ref> Dhaka became one of the richest and greatest cities in the world during the early period of Bengal Subah (1610-1717). The prosperity of Dhaka reached its peak during the administration of governor [[Shaista Khan]] (1644-1677 and 1680–1688). Rice was then sold at eight maunds per rupee. Thomas Bowrey, an English merchant sailor who visited the city between 1669 and 1670, wrote that the city was 40 miles in circuit. He estimated the city to be more populated than [[London]] with 900,000 people.<ref>Historical Background for the Establishment of Naib-Nazimship (Deputy Governorship for the four Divisions of Subah Bangla), ''Asiatic Society of Bangladesh''</ref>

Bengal became the economic engine of the Mughal Empire. Dhaka played a key role in the [[proto-industrialisation]] of Bengal. It was the centre of the [[muslin trade in Bengal]], leading to muslin being called "daka" in distant markets as far away as [[Central Asia]].<ref>Richard Maxwell Eaton (1996), The Rise of Islam and the Bengal Frontier, 1204-1760, page 202, University of California Press</ref>  [[Islam Khan I]] was the first Mughal governor to reside in the city.<ref>{{cite book |editor-last=Kraas |editor-first=Frauke |editor-last2=Aggarwal |editor-first2=Surinder |editor-last3=Coy |editor-first3=Martin |editor-last4=Mertins |editor-first4=Günter |year=2013 |title=Megacities: Our Global Urban Future |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TwHFBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA60 |publisher=Springer |page=60 |isbn=978-90-481-3417-5}}</ref> Khan named it "Jahangir Nagar" (''The City of Jahangir'') in honour of the Emperor Jahangir.

Under the Nawabs of Bengal, the [[Naib Nazim of Dhaka]] was in charge of the city. The Naib Nazim was the deputy governor of Bengal. He also dealt with the upkeep of the Mughal Navy. The Naib Nazim was in charge of the Dhaka Division, which included Dhaka, [[Comilla]], and Chittagong. Dhaka Division was one of the four divisions under the Nawabs of Bengal. The Nawabs of Bengal allowed European trading companies to establish factories across Bengal. The region then became a hotbed for European rivalries. The British moved to oust the last independent Nawab of Bengal in 1757, who was allied with the French. Due to the defection of Nawab's army chief [[Mir Jafar]] to the British side, the last Nawab lost the [[Battle of Plassey]].{{citation needed|date=May 2024}}

In the northern part of the Dhaka division, [[Bhawal Estate]] was a large [[zamindari]] in [[Bengal]] (in modern-day [[Gazipur]], Bangladesh) until it was abolished according to ''East Bengal State Acquisition and Tenancy Act of 1950''. In the late 17th century, Daulat Ghazi was the zamindar of the Ghazi estate of Bhawal. Bala Ram was Diwan of Daulat Ghazi. In 1704, as the consequence of change in the policy of revenue collection, Bala Ram's son Sri Krishna was installed as the zamindar of Bhawal by [[Murshid Quli Khan]]. Since then, through acquisitions the zamindari expanded. The family turned into the proprietor of the whole Bhawal pargana after purchasing the zamindari of J. Wise, an indigo grower for Rs 4,46,000.<ref name=bpedia>{{cite Banglapedia|article=Bhawal Estate}}</ref> In 1878, [[British Raj]] conferred ''Raja'' title to Zamindar Kalinarayan Roy Chowdhury who oversaw the Bhawal estate.<ref name=bpedia/> At its peak, the estate comprised over 1,500 square kilometer, which included 2,274 villages and around 55,000 villagers.<ref name=haunted>{{Cite web|date=2016-05-13|title=The Haunted Estate|url=https://www.thedailystar.net/star-weekend/heritage/the-haunted-estate-1222729|access-date=2020-06-24|website=The Daily Star|language=en|author=Apurba Jahangir}}</ref>

On the southern side the notable township was Fatehabad located by a stream known as the Dead Padma, which was {{convert|20|mi|km|order=flip}} from the main channel of the Padma River. Sultan [[Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah]] established a [[Mint (facility)|mint]] in Fatehabad during his reign in the early 15th century.

In [[Ain-i-Akbari]], it was named as ''Haweli Mahal Fatehabad'' during the reign of [[Emperor Akbar]] in the [[Mughal Empire]].

Dhaka's fortunes changed in the early 20th century. British neglect of Dhaka's urban development was overturned with the [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|first partition of Bengal]] in 1905, which restored Dhaka's status as a regional capital. The city became the seat of government for [[Eastern Bengal and Assam]], with a jurisdiction covering most of modern-day Bangladesh and all of what is now [[Northeast India]]. The partition was the brainchild of [[Lord Curzon]], who finally acted on British ideas for partitioning Bengal with a view to improving administration, education, and business. Dhaka became the seat of the [[Eastern Bengal and Assam Legislative Council]]. Dhaka was the seat of government for 4 administrative divisions, including the Assam Valley Division, Chittagong Division, Dacca Division, Rajshahi Division, and the Surma Valley Division. There were a total of 30 districts in Eastern Bengal and Assam, including Dacca, Mymensingh, Faridpur and [[Barisal Division|Backergunge]] in Dacca Division; [[Comilla Division|Tippera]], Noakhali, Chittagong and the [[Hill Tracts]] in Chittagong Division; Rajshahi, Dinajpur, [[Jalpaiguri division|Jalpaiguri]], Rangpur, Bogra, Pabna and [[Malda division|Malda]] in Rajshahi Division; Sylhet, [[Barak Valley|Cachar]], the [[Khasi and Jaintia Hills]], the [[Nagaland|Naga Hills]] and the [[Mizoram|Lushai Hills]] in Surma Valley Division; and [[Goalpara district|Goalpara]], [[Undivided Kamrup district|Kamrup]], the [[Meghalaya|Garo Hills]], [[Darrang]], [[Nagaon district|Nowgong]], [[Sivasagar district|Sibsagar]] and [[Lakhimpur district|Lakhimpur]] in Assam Valley Division.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eastern Bengal and Assam - Encyclopedia |url=https://theodora.com/encyclopedia/e/eastern_bengal_and_assam.html |access-date=23 October 2022 |website=theodora.com |language=en |archive-date=23 October 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221023123814/https://www.theodora.com/encyclopedia/e/eastern_bengal_and_assam.html |url-status=live }}</ref> The province was bordered by [[Cooch Behar State]], [[Hill Tipperah]] and the [[Kingdom of Bhutan]].

The [[East Pakistan Helicopter Service]] connected the city to regional towns.

The [[Dhaka Stock Exchange]] was opened on 28 April 1954. The first local airline [[Orient Airways]] began flights between Dhaka and [[Karachi]] on 6 June 1954.

In 1982, the English spelling of the Dacca Division (along with the name of the capital city) was changed into Dhaka Division to more closely match the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] pronunciation.

==Administrative divisions==

Dhaka Division consisted before 2015 of four [[city corporation]]s, 13 districts, 123 upazilas and 1,248 union parishads. However, four of the most northerly of the 17 districts were removed in 2015 to create the new [[Mymensingh Division]], and another five districts (those situated to the south of the [[Ganges]]/[[Padma River]]) are in the process of being removed to create a new [[Faridpur Division]].
