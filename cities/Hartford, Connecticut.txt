==History==

{{Main|History of Hartford, Connecticut}}
{{For timeline}}

Various tribes lived in or around Hartford, all [[Algonquian peoples]]. These included the [[Podunk people|Podunks]], mostly east of the Connecticut River; the Poquonocks north and west of Hartford; the Massacoes in the [[Simsbury, Connecticut|Simsbury]] area; the [[Tunxis]] tribe in [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]] and [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]]; the [[Wangunk]]s to the south; and the [[Saukiog]] in Hartford itself.<ref>Bacon, Nick. 2013.

===Colonial Hartford===

[[File:Hartford, Connecticut (NYPL b12349142-422931).jpg|thumb|Hartford, {{circa|1770s}}|left]]
The first Europeans known to have explored the area were the [[Dutch colonization of the Americas|Dutch]] under [[Adriaen Block]], who sailed up the Connecticut in 1614. Dutch fur traders from [[New Amsterdam]] returned in 1623 with a mission to establish a trading post and fortify the area for the [[Dutch West India Company]]. The original site was located on the south bank of the [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park River]] in the present-day Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhood. This fort was called [[Fort Hoop]] or the "House of Hope." In 1633, Jacob Van Curler formally bought the land around Fort Hoop from the [[Pequot]] chief for a small sum. It was home to perhaps a couple of families and a few dozen soldiers. The fort was abandoned by 1654, but the area is known today as Dutch Point; the name of the Dutch fort "House of Hope" is reflected in the name of Huyshope Avenue.<ref>{{cite book|last=Sterner|first=Daniel|title=A Guide to Historic Hartford, Connecticut|year=2012|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-60949-635-7|page=81|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x6QkVFi7l6UC&q=sheldon+charter+oak+neighborhood&pg=PA81|access-date=August 16, 2014}}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=House of Hope |url=http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital-exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/connecticut/house-of-hope/ |publisher=The New Netherland Institute |access-date=April 5, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150410075959/http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/digital-exhibitions/a-tour-of-new-netherland/connecticut/house-of-hope |archive-date=April 10, 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> A significant reason for establishment of the Dutch trading post was to better control the flow of [[wampum]], the de facto currency of New Netherland and portions of New England, to and from valuable Native American fur traders.<ref>Peterson, Mark. The City-State of Boston. Princeton University Press, 2019, page 48.</ref>

The Dutch outpost and the tiny contingent of Dutch soldiers who were stationed there did little to check the English migration, and the Dutch soon realized that they were vastly outnumbered. The House of Hope remained an outpost, but it was steadily swallowed up by waves of English settlers. In 1650, [[Peter Stuyvesant]] met with English representatives to negotiate a permanent boundary between the Dutch and English colonies; the line that they agreed on was more than {{convert|50|mi|km}} west of the original settlement.

The English began to arrive in 1636, settling upstream from Fort Hoop near the present-day Downtown and Sheldon/Charter Oak neighborhoods.<ref>{{cite book

As the Puritan minister in Hartford, Thomas Hooker wielded a great deal of power; in 1638, he delivered a sermon that inspired the writing of the [[Fundamental Orders of Connecticut]], which provided a framework for Connecticut's separation for [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and the formation of a civil government. The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut were the legal basis for Connecticut Colony until the [[History of the Connecticut Constitution|1662 royal charter]] granted to Connecticut by [[Charles II of England|Charles II]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Nancy Finlay|url=https://connecticuthistory.org/thomas-hooker-connecticuts-founding-father/|title=Thomas Hooker: Connecticut's Founding Father|date=September 22, 2020|website=ConnecticutHistory.org}}</ref>

The original settlement area contained the site of the [[Charter Oak]], an old white oak tree in which colonists hid [[Connecticut Constitutional History#The Connecticut Charter of 1662|Connecticut's Royal Charter of 1662]] to protect it from confiscation by an English governor-general. The state adopted the oak tree as the emblem on the Connecticut state quarter.

In 1860, Hartford was the site of the first "[[Wide Awakes]]", abolitionist supporters of [[Abraham Lincoln]]. These supporters organized torch-light parades that were both political and social events, often including fireworks and music, in celebration of Lincoln's visit to the city. This type of event caught on and eventually became a staple of mid-to-late 19th-century campaigning.<ref>{{cite web |title=Hartford Wide-Awakes – Today in History: July 26 |url=https://connecticuthistory.org/hartford-wide-awakes-today-in-history/ |website=Connecticuthistory.org |access-date=April 30, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501231223/http://connecticuthistory.org/hartford-wide-awakes-today-in-history/ |archive-date=May 1, 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Hartford was a major manufacturing city from the 19th century until the mid-20th century. During the Industrial Revolution into the mid-20th century, the Connecticut River Valley cities produced many major precision manufacturing innovations. Among these was Hartford's pioneer bicycle and automobile maker [[Pope Manufacturing Company|Pope]].<ref>Clymer, Floyd. ''Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925'' (New York: Bonanza Books, 1950), p.37.</ref> Many factories have been closed or relocated, or have reduced operations, as in nearly all former Northern manufacturing cities.

====Rise of a major manufacturing center====

A variety of industries adopted and adapted these techniques over the next several decades, and Hartford became the center of production for a wide array of products, including: [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt]], [[Richard Gatling]], and [[John Browning]] firearms; Weed [[sewing machines]]; Columbia bicycles; Pope automobiles; and leading typewriter manufacturers [[Royal Typewriter Company]] and [[Underwood Typewriter Company]] which together made Hartford the “Typewriter Capitol of the World” during the first half of the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hintz|first1=Eric|title=Samuel Colt&nbsp;... and Sewing Machines?|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/2012/06/samuel-coltand-sewing-machines-part-1.html|access-date=June 8, 2015|work=O, Say Can You See Blog|publisher=National Museum of American History|date=June 6, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608195811/http://americanhistory.si.edu/blog/2012/06/samuel-coltand-sewing-machines-part-1.html|archive-date=June 8, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

The [[Pratt & Whitney Measurement Systems|Pratt & Whitney Company]] was founded in Hartford in 1860 by Francis A. Pratt and Amos Whitney. They built a substantial factory in which the company manufactured a wide range of machine tools, including tools for the makers of sewing machines, and gun-making machinery for use by the Union Army during the American Civil War. In 1925, the company expanded into aircraft engine design at its Hartford factory.

[[File:Connecticut - Hartford - NARA - 23936447 (cropped).jpg|thumb|left|Pratt & Whitney Factory, 1940]]

Just three years after Colt's first factory opened, the [[Sharps Rifle Manufacturing Company]] set up shop in 1852 at a nearby site along the now-buried [[Park River (Connecticut)|Park River]], located in the present-day neighborhood of [[Frog Hollow, Hartford, Connecticut|Frog Hollow]]. Their factory heralded the beginning of the area's transformation from marshy farmland into a major industrial zone. The road leading from town to the factory was called Rifle Lane; the name was later changed to College Street and then Capitol Avenue.<ref name="Flayderman 2007 193–196">{{cite book|last=Flayderman|first=Norm|title=Flayderman's Guide to Antique American Firearms and Their Values|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=THeWYkwoLSUC&pg=PA195|year=2007|publisher=F+W Media, Inc|location=Iola, Wisconsin|isbn=978-0-89689-455-6|pages=193–196|access-date=October 16, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102051906/https://books.google.com/books?id=THeWYkwoLSUC&pg=PA195|archive-date=January 2, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> A century earlier, mills had located along the Park River because of the water power, but by the 1850s water power was approaching obsolescence. Sharps located there specifically to take advantage of the railroad line that had been constructed alongside the river in 1838.

The Sharps Rifle Company failed in 1870, and the Weed Sewing Machine Company took over its factory. The invention of a new type of sewing machine led to a new application of mass production after the principles of interchangeability were applied to clocks and guns. The Weed Company played a major role in making Hartford one of three machine tool centers in New England and even outranked the [[Colt Armory]] in nearby Coltsville in size.<ref name="Flayderman 2007 193–196"/> Weed eventually became the birthplace of both the bicycle and automobile industries in Hartford.

Industrialist [[Albert Augustus Pope|Albert Pope]] was inspired by a British-made, high-wheeled bicycle (called a velocipede) that he saw at the [[Centennial Exposition|1876 Philadelphia Centennial Exposition]], and he bought patent rights for bicycle production in the United States. He wanted to contract out his first order, however, so he approached George Fairfield of Weed Sewing Machine Company, who produced Pope's first run of bicycles in 1878.<ref>{{cite web|title=Invention hot spot: Beginnings of mass production in 19th-century Hartford, Connecticut |url=http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/poi-hartford.aspx |website=invention.smithsonian.org |publisher=Jerome and Dorothy Lemelson Center for the Study of Invention and Innovation, Smithsonian Institution |access-date=August 15, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819083138/http://invention.smithsonian.org/centerpieces/poi-hartford.aspx |archive-date=August 19, 2014 }}</ref> Bicycles proved to be a huge commercial success, and production expanded in the Weed factory, with Weed making every part but the tires. Demand for bicycles overshadowed the failing sewing machine market by 1890, so Pope bought the Weed factory, took over as its president, and renamed it the [[Pope Manufacturing Company]]. The bicycle boom was short-lived, peaking near the turn of the century when more and more consumers craved individual automobile travel, and Pope's company suffered financially from over-production amidst falling demand.

In an effort to save his business, Pope opened a motor carriage department and turned out electric carriages, beginning with the "Mark III" in 1897. His venture might have made Hartford the capital of the automobile industry were it not for the ascendancy of Henry Ford and a series of pitfalls and patent struggles that outlived Pope himself.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Goddard|first1=Stephen B.|title=Colonel Albert Pope and His American Dream Machines: The Life and Times of a Bicycle Tycoon Turned Automotive Pioneer|date=December 30, 2008|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-4089-4|pages=176–182}}</ref>

In 1876, Hartford Machine Screw was granted a charter "for the purpose of manufacturing screws, hardware and machinery of every variety." The basis for its incorporation was the invention of the first single-spindle automatic screw machine. For its next four years, the new firm occupied one of Weed's buildings, milling thousands of screws daily on over 50 machines. Its president was George Fairfield, who ran Weed, and its superintendent was Christopher Spencer, one of Connecticut's most versatile inventors. Soon Hartford Machine Screw outgrew its quarters and built a new factory adjacent to Weed, where it remained until 1948.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/12/nyregion/116-year-old-company-thrives-on-innovation.html|title=116-Year-Old Company Thrives on Innovation|last=Hamilton|first=Robert A.|date=April 12, 1992|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=April 30, 2017|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526054145/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/12/nyregion/116-year-old-company-thrives-on-innovation.html|archive-date=May 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Government==

{{see also|Mayor of Hartford, Connecticut|Mayoral elections in Hartford, Connecticut}}
Like all cities in Connecticut except [[Groton (city), Connecticut|Groton]], Hartford is legally a [[coterminous municipality|consolidated city-town]]; both the town and the city have been legally consolidated since 1896, though since 1784 the city's boundaries have been coextensive with those of the town.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}}

Hartford is governed via the strong-mayor form of the [[mayor-council system]]. The current mayor is [[Arunan Arulampalam]]. Hartford voted in favor of restoring a mayor-council system in 2003, more than 50 years after establishing the [[council-manager]] form. Mayor [[Eddie Perez (politician)|Eddie Perez]] was first elected in 2001 and was re-elected with 76% of the vote in 2003. As the first strong mayor elected under the revised charter, he is widely credited with reducing crime, reforming the school system, and sparking economic revitalization in the city. However, his reputation was hurt by accusations of corruption.<ref name="hartfordinfo.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.hartfordinfo.org/issues/documents/government/htfd_courant_102807_1.asp |title=Mr. Perez For Mayor - HartfordInfo.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180238/http://www.hartfordinfo.org/issues/documents/government/htfd_courant_102807_1.asp |archive-date=March 3, 2016 }}</ref> The city council, formally known as the "Court of Common Council", has nine members.

In Connecticut, there is no county-level executive or legislative government. The state abolished county government in 1960, and since then counties have served as little more than boundaries for the state's probate, civil, and criminal courts. Connecticut municipalities provide nearly all local services such as fire and rescue, education, and snow removal.<ref>{{Cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1960/08/14/archives/connecticut-ends-county-rule-oct-1-state-to-take-over-historic.html | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Connecticut Ends County Rule Oct. 1; State to Take Over Historic Government Units – Minor Court System Also to Go | date=August 14, 1960 | access-date=May 20, 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704125722/https://www.nytimes.com/1960/08/14/archives/connecticut-ends-county-rule-oct-1-state-to-take-over-historic.html | archive-date=July 4, 2018 | url-status=live }}</ref>

Hartford passed an ordinance providing services to all residents regardless of their [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]] in 2008. Said ordinance also prohibits police from detaining individuals based solely on their immigration status or inquiring as to their immigration status. In 2016, the ordinance was amended to declare that Hartford is a "[[Sanctuary city]]", although the term itself does not have an established legal meaning.<ref>{{cite news |title=Mayor Bronin Says Hartford to Remain a Sanctuary City |url=https://www.wnpr.org/post/mayor-bronin-says-hartford-remain-sanctuary-city |work=Connecticut Public Radio |date=November 18, 2016 |access-date=September 5, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190905081558/https://www.wnpr.org/post/mayor-bronin-says-hartford-remain-sanctuary-city |archive-date=September 5, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.municode.com/library/ct/hartford/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIIMUCO_CH2AD_ARTXXICISEREIMST|title=Hartford Municipal Code|website=municode.com|date=July 3, 2019|access-date=September 5, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321083343/https://www.municode.com/library/ct/hartford/codes/code_of_ordinances?nodeId=PTIIMUCO_CH2AD_ARTXXICISEREIMST|archive-date=March 21, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>

Hartford is a predominantly Democratic city and has voted for every presidential candidate in the party since [[Al Smith]] in 1928.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}} In 2016, the city voted for Clinton 90%–8%, a slight shift from voting for Obama 93%–6% in the previous election.

==Recent developments==
[[File:NovaBUS LFX.jpg|thumb|[[CTfastrak]] was built to connect the suburbs to Hartford.]]
* Adriaen's Landing – The state and privately funded project is situated on the banks of the Connecticut River along Columbus Boulevard, and connects to Constitution Plaza. Constitution Plaza forced hundreds of households to relocate when it was built a few decades ago. The latest project includes the {{convert|540000|sqft|m2|-3|adj=on}} Connecticut Convention Center, which opened in June 2005 and is the largest meeting space between New York City and [[Boston]]. Attached to the Convention Center is the 22-story, 409-room [[Marriott International|Marriott]] Hartford Hotel-Downtown, which opened in August 2005. Being constructed next to the convention center and hotel is the {{convert|140000|sqft|m2|-3|adj=on}} Connecticut Science Center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://crdact.net/regional_development/adriaens_landing.html|title=Adriaen's Landing|website=Crdact.net|access-date=May 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629033251/http://crdact.net/regional_development/adriaens_landing.html|archive-date=June 29, 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* [[Capital Community College]] at the 11-story G. Fox Department Store Building – The {{convert|913000|sqft|m2|-2|adj=on}} former home of the [[G. Fox & Co.|G. Fox & Company Department Store]] on Main Street has been renovated and made the new home of Capital Community College as well as offices for the State of Connecticut and ground level retail space. Capital Community College helps train (mostly) adult students in specific career fields. On Thursdays, vendors sell crafts on the Main Street level. Two music clubs, Mezzanine and Room 960, are housed in the building.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.capitalcc.edu/|title=Capital Community College {{!}}|website=Capitalcc.edu|access-date=May 21, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509084157/https://www.capitalcc.edu/|archive-date=May 9, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>
* [[CTfastrak]] – The recently completed [[bus rapid transit]] system connects Hartford's Union Station to downtown New Britain. It was built to ease traffic on [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ctfastrak.com/about/news/news-releases/13-media-releases/279-03-28-15-despite-snow-thousands-of-riders-many-first-timers-experience-ctfastrak-on-first-day-of-service|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911222239/http://ctfastrak.com/about/news/news-releases/13-media-releases/279-03-28-15-despite-snow-thousands-of-riders-many-first-timers-experience-ctfastrak-on-first-day-of-service|url-status=dead|archive-date=September 11, 2015|title=CTfastrak.com – (03/28/15) Despite Snow, Thousands of Riders, Many First-Timers, Experience CTfastrak on First Day of Service|date=September 11, 2015|access-date=May 21, 2017}}</ref>
*Front Street – The final component of Adriaen's Landing, Front Street, sits across from the Convention Center and covers the land between Columbus Boulevard and [[The Hartford Times Building]]. The Front Street development combines retail, entertainment and residential components. Publicly funded parts of the project will include transportation improvements. There have been significant delays in the Front Street project, and the first developer was removed from the project because of lack of progress. The city has chosen a new developer, but work is yet to begin on the retail and residential component of Front Street. The city and state may soon take action to increase the speed with which the project enters implementation phases. There has been talk of bringing an [[ESPN Zone]] to the Front Street ([[ESPN]] is headquartered in nearby [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.frontstreetdistrict.com/index.html |title=The New Pulse of Hartford &#124; Home |publisher=Front Street District |access-date=June 9, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326123201/http://www.frontstreetdistrict.com/index.html |archive-date=March 26, 2012 }}</ref> On the back side of Front Street, the historic [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] Hartford Times Building is being converted into a downtown campus of the [[University of Connecticut]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gosselin|first1=Kenneth|title=Authority Gets Look at Latest UConn Hartford Campus Renderings|url=http://www.courant.com/real-estate/property-line/hc-uconn-hartford-connecticut-campus-new-renderings-20141121-story.html|newspaper=The Hartford Courant|date=November 21, 2014|access-date=March 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402012736/http://www.courant.com/real-estate/property-line/hc-uconn-hartford-connecticut-campus-new-renderings-20141121-story.html|archive-date=April 2, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>
* [[Hartford Line]] – According to Connecticut Governor Malloy, the Hartford Line commuter rail service will reach speeds up to {{convert|110|mph|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name="nhregister.com">{{cite news|url=http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2011/04/07/news/doc4d9cf8b24e8c3339028689.txt |title=Conn. seeks funds for rail work on Hartford-to-Springfield line (document) |newspaper=The New Haven Register |date=April 7, 2011 |access-date=June 9, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120419101014/http://www.nhregister.com/articles/2011/04/07/news/doc4d9cf8b24e8c3339028689.txt |archive-date=April 19, 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The rail line is intended to unite the densely populated, {{convert|61|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) region between Hartford, Springfield, and New Haven; ease the frequently congested [[Interstate 91]] automobile highway; and increase mobility in a region that is now almost entirely dependent upon automobile ownership. As of May 2011, Connecticut's portion of the commuter line has been three-quarters funded. Currently, the state is seeking the $227&nbsp;million necessary to complete the northern portion of the line from the $2.4&nbsp;billion in federal funds that Florida rejected to fund its own high-speed rail project.<ref name="nhregister.com" />
*Knowledge Corridor Partnership – In 2000, at [[The Big E]] in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]], Hartford and Springfield, Massachusetts – the two major New England, [[Connecticut River Valley]] cities with centers only {{convert|24|mi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) apart – jointly announced the [[Knowledge Corridor]] Partnership. The Knowledge Corridor Partnership aims to unite the two metropolitan areas economically, culturally, and geographically. The nickname comes from the metropolitan region's over 32 universities and liberal arts colleges, including several of the United States' most prestigious. As of the 10th anniversary of the Knowledge Corridor, it was announced that the Knowledge Corridor is beginning to receive federal funds, as opposed to either state or city funds.<ref name=":4">{{cite web|author=Kinney|first=Jim|date=October 24, 2010|title=Hartford Springfield Economic Partnership gets $4.2&nbsp;million to boost Knowledge Corridor|url=https://www.masslive.com/business-news/2010/10/hartford_springfield_economic_partnershi.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925033206/http://www.masslive.com/business-news/index.ssf/2010/10/hartford_springfield_economic_partnershi.html|archive-date=September 25, 2012|access-date=June 9, 2012|website=Masslive.com}}</ref>
