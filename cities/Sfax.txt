The city, founded in AD{{nbsp}}849 on the ruins of [[Taparura]], is the capital of the [[Sfax Governorate]] (about 955,421 inhabitants in 2014),{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} and a [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] port. Sfax has a population of 341,999 (census 2022).<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Dumper |first1=Michael |last2=Stanley |first2=Bruce E. |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/80014324 |title=Cities of the Middle East and North Africa : a historical encyclopedia |date=2007 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=978-1-57607-920-1 |location=Santa Barbara, Calif. |oclc=80014324}}</ref> Its main industries include [[phosphate]], [[olive]] and [[nut (fruit)|nut]] processing, fishing (it is the largest fishing port in [[Tunisia]]) and [[international trade]].

== History ==
=== Carthaginian and Aghlabid eras ===
{{Further|Taparura|Thenae}}
Present-day Sfax was founded by the [[Aghlabid]]s in AD{{nbsp}}849 on the site of the town of [[Taparura]]. The modern city has also grown to cover some other ancient settlements, most notably [[Thenae]] in its southern suburb of [[Thyna]].

=== Almohad era ===
By the end of the 10th century, Sfax had become an independent [[city-state]]. The city was conquered by [[Roger II of Sicily]] in 1148 and occupied until it was liberated in 1156 after a revolt and taken by the [[Almohads]], and was briefly occupied by European forces again, this time by the Spanish, in the 16th century, before falling into [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] hands. Sfax became an integral base of the [[Barbary pirates|Barbary piracy]], prompting an unsuccessful invasion by [[Venice]] in 1185.

=== Hafsid era ===
Abou Yahya Abou Bekr finally re-established [[Hafsid]] unity and recaptured [[Kerkennah]] from the Christians in 1335. The peace returned to the country was only disturbed by rare episodes, the most lasting of which began with the price of Sfax by the dissident brothers, Ahmed and Abdelmalèk ben Makki.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

Towards 1370, following the arrival of Caliph Abdul-Abbas, Sfax returned under the Hafsid era.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}}

After more than three centuries, which had seen the preponderance of the Hafsids, the conflict between the [[Turkish people|Turks]] and the [[Spaniards]] precipitated the fall of their dynasty. In 1534, the privateer Barberousse entered Tunis, proclaimed the decline of the Hafsids and effortlessly reunited the towns of the coast, among them the town of Sfax.<ref name="inp.rnrt.tn">{{cite web|url=http://www.inp.rnrt.tn/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=143%3Asfaxar&catid=1%3Asites&Itemid=6&lang=fr|title = Sfax}}</ref>

=== Husseinid era ===
The founder of the new dynasty, Hussein, gave the country unquestionable economic prosperity. In Sfax, the mosque is enlarged, which regains its original extent; the new mihrâb is dated 1758, the work was completed in 1783.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

The ramparts were restored and two large reservoirs were built to supplement the Nasriah cisterns. In 1776, the southern suburb of the city, the Frankish quarter, was built, reserved for Jews and Christians, a major place of maritime trade, but which was also to serve as a buffer against sea attacks, which were still to be feared. The eventuality was not long in coming, the Venetians bombarding Sfax four times in the space of two years (1785–86). A large fort was built during the siege to flank Borj Ennar; it was demolished after the last war.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}}

Around 1830, the Frankish quarter was surrounded by a wall and in 1860 the city had a post office and telegraph. In 1876, the telegraph clerk made a plan of the city and told us about a signal tower built a century earlier and of which we have lost track.<ref name="inp.rnrt.tn" />

=== French era ===
{{See also|French protectorate of Tunisia}}
When the [[Muhammad III as-Sadiq|Bey of Tunis]] signed the Bardo Treaty, in 1881, making [[Tunisia]] a protectorate, an insurrection broke out in Sfax. Six ironclads were dispatched from [[Toulon]] (''[[French ironclad Colbert|Colbert]]'', ''Friedland'', ''Marengo'', ''Trident'', ''Revanche'', ''Surveillante'') to join the French Navy ships in Tunisian waters. In Sfax, three ironclads from the Division of the Levant were already present ([[French ironclad Alma|''Alma'']], [[French ironclad Reine Blanche|''Reine Blanche'']], ''La Galissonnière''), together with four cannon boats.<ref>{{cite book |last=Randier |first=Jean |date=2006 |title=La Royale |publisher=Babouji |isbn=2-35261-022-2 |page=395}}</ref> Sfax was bombarded, and on 16 July the city was taken by the French after hard fighting, with seven dead and 32 wounded for the French.{{Sfn | Randier | 2006 | p = 395}}

=== World War II ===

{{See also|World War II}}
During [[World War II]], the [[Axis powers]] used the city as a major base until [[Tunisia Campaign|British forces took it]] on 10 April 1943. After World War II, Tunisia was returned to France, but [[Tunisian independence|gained independence]] in 1956.

== Geography ==
=== Climate ===
Sfax has a hot [[semi-arid climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''BSh''). Owing to its sheltered location relative to Mediterranean Sea winter storms, Sfax receives half the rainfall of Tunis and less even than the major cities of Libya ([[Tripoli, Libya|Tripoli]] and [[Benghazi]]). Summers, like all of North Africa, are hot and almost rainless, whilst winters are very pleasant with usually only light rain.

=== Topography ===
The topography of the governorate of Sfax tilts regularly from the west to the coast and local presents small hills and mountain ranges in the form of elongated draâs.
[[File:Sfax 10.76028E 34.74052N.png|thumb|right|View of Sfax]]

==== Relief ====
Sfax is characterized by a monotonous, low and slightly uneven relief. The altitude y rarely exceed 250&nbsp;m, especially in the center-west of the governorate (Draâ Lahirech, 269&nbsp;m; Djebel Chebka, 255&nbsp;m). Most of the study site extends over wide plains not exceeding the 150&nbsp;m above sea level, including a low coastal strip about 15&nbsp;km wide and having an average altitude of 20&nbsp;m.<ref>[http://www.mehat.gov.tn/fileadmin/user_upload/Amenagement_Territoire/AtlasSfaxFr.pdf#page=16 Atlas du Gouvernorat de Sfax: Page 16 (In French)]</ref>

==== Hydrography ====
The monotonous character, low and not very rugged of the topography largely determined the characteristics hydrographic in the governorate of Sfax. Indeed, the rivers are numerous, shallow and rarely reaches the sea. The hills and small mountain ranges of the center-west present a hydrographic hairline dense and relatively deep compared to the coastal strip. Like a few exoreic rivers (wadi Agareb, wadi Laâchech, wadi El Maleh), most of the Wadis are endorheic, leading to closed depressions of the sebkhas and garâas type. Depending on their morpho-structural conditions, these closed depressions take the form of basins synclinal (Menzel Chaker and Hancha regions) or the form of sebkhas and garâas (Noual, Bou Jmal, Mchiguigue, Karafita... etc.).<ref>[http://www.mehat.gov.tn/fileadmin/user_upload/Amenagement_Territoire/AtlasSfaxFr.pdf#page=17 Atlas du Gouvernorat de Sfax: Page 17 (In French)]</ref>

== Neighborhoods ==
Whether in the city center or between the radial roads, there are large, popular neighborhoods in Sfax, most of which are:
* Hay El Rabdh
* Hay El Habib
* Hay El Bahri
* Hay Bourguiba
* Hay El Badrani
* Hay Ennasr
* Hay El Maez
* Hay Thyna

== Architecture and urbanism ==
=== Medina ===
{{See also|Medina of Sfax}}
The Medina represents one of the most important quarters of Sfax. it plays a touristic and historical role of the city. It was built by Aghlabid prince Abu Abbass Muhammad between 849 and 851. The medina is home to about 113,000 residents and is dominated by the Great Mosque of Sfax.

==== Walls and gates ====
{{See also|Gates of Sfax}}
[[File:Sfax.jpg|thumb|Walls of the medina]]
Apart from Borj Ennar and three other towers that disappeared, the walls of the medina kept the same original architecture since 1306.<ref name=":2">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfax1881-1956.com/Origines/origines.htm|title=Les origines|website=sfax1881-1956.com|access-date=10 January 2018}}</ref> These are 2,750 meters long and have 34 dungeons. Their height varies between seven and eleven meters.<ref name=":2" />

Originally, the medina had only two doors: [[Bab Jebli]], also known as Bab Dhahraoui (northern door), and [[Bab Diwan]] or Bab Bahr (the sea door). Yet, in the 20th century and because of the economic development and the huge increase of the population, new doors had to be created to reduce the flow from these two main doors such as [[Bab El Ksar]] and [[Bab Jebli Jedid]].<ref name=":3">{{cite web|url=http://www.lesitesfaxien.net/sfax/sfax-autrefois/quartiers-de-sfax/6-les-portes-de-la-medina|title=Les portes de la Médina|last=Bensalah|first=Moncef|website=lesitesfaxien.net|language=fr-fr|access-date=16 February 2018|archive-date=16 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016014204/http://www.lesitesfaxien.net/sfax/sfax-autrefois/quartiers-de-sfax/6-les-portes-de-la-medina|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Its construction was preceded by the deployment of the wall and the [[medina quarter]]. Today it is served as a museum of traditional architecture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.patrimoinedetunisie.com.tn/eng/monuments/kasbah_sfax.php|title=Kasbah of Sfax|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>

The project of the construction of the Palace of the scourge began at the beginning of the twentieth century, where the municipality issued a tender for this purpose in the newspaper Adebash Svaxian on 30 June 1904 and began construction works in late 1905 and ended in 1906
