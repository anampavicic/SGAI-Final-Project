Gaborone was once one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, and this has created problems with housing and illegal settlements. The city has also dealt with conflicts spilling into the country from [[Zimbabwe]] and [[South Africa]] during the 1980s.

Gaborone is the economic capital as well as the government capital; it is headquarters to numerous companies and the [[Botswana Stock Exchange]]. Gaborone is also home to the [[Southern African Development Community]] (SADC), a regional economic community established in 1980.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sadc.int/about-sadc|title=Southern African Development Community :: About SADC|website=www.sadc.int|access-date=April 28, 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312200255/http://www.sadc.int/about-sadc/|archive-date=12 March 2018}}</ref> Many languages are spoken there, Setswana ([[Tswana language|Tswana]]) being the main tongue.

Evidence shows that there have been inhabitants along the [[Notwane River]] for centuries. In more recent history, the [[Tlokwa]] left the [[Magaliesberg]] ranges to settle in the area around 1880, and called the settlement ''[[Moshaweng]]''.

The modern town was only founded in 1964, after a decision was taken to establish a capital for Botswana, which became a self governing territory in 1965, before becoming a fully independent republic on 30 September 1966.

In 1965, the capital of the [[Bechuanaland Protectorate]] moved from [[Mahikeng|Mafeking]] to Gaberones.<ref>Roman Adrian Cybriwsky, ''Capital Cities around the World: An Encyclopedia of Geography, History, and Culture'', ABC-CLIO, USA, 2013, p. 113</ref> When Botswana gained its independence, [[Lobatse]] was the first choice as the nation's capital.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Books|first=L.

Most of the early town was built within three years, as a small town designed to accommodate 20,000 people – only to later develop after independence into a modern city. Buildings in early Gaborone include assembly buildings, government offices, a power station, a hospital, schools, a radio station, a telephone exchange, police stations, a post office, and more than 1,000 houses.<ref name=architecture>{{cite web |author=killion |title=The Unsustainable urban growth of Gaborone City, Botswana |url=http://www.boidus.co.uk/?p=1188 |publisher=Boidus: Blogs |date=29 June 2009 |access-date=4 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121111202355/http://www.boidus.co.uk/?p=1188 |archive-date=11 November 2012 }}</ref> Because the town was built so quickly, there was a massive influx of labourers who had built illegal settlements on the new city's southern industrial development zone. These settlements were named Naledi. The latter term literally means "the star", but could also mean "under the open sky" or "a community that stands out from all others". In 1971, because of the growth of illegal settlements, the Gaborone Town Council and the Ministry of Local Government and Lands surveyed an area called Bontleng, which would contain low-income housing. However, Naledi still grew, and the demand for housing was greater than ever. In 1973, the Botswana Housing Corporation (BHC) built a "New Naledi" across the road from the "Old Naledi". Residents from Old Naledi would be moved to New Naledi. However, the demand for housing increased yet again; moreover, the residents who relocated to New Naledi disliked the houses. The problem was solved in 1975 when Sir [[Seretse Khama]], the president of Botswana, rezoned Naledi from an industrial zone to a low-income housing area.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Old Naledi, the village becomes a town: an outline of the Old Naledi Squatter Upgrading Project, Gaborone, Botswana|last=Van Nostrand|first=John Cornelius|publisher=James Lorimer & Company|year=1982|isbn=978-0-88862-650-9|access-date=19 September 2009|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGjfAc4J1yUC&pg=PP13|chapter=Old Naledi: History of Settlement|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGjfAc4J1yUC&pg=PP13|pages=13–15}}</ref>

===Utilities===
The city gets most of its water from the reservoir formed from the [[Gaborone Dam]] on the southeast side of the city, which has facilitated growth.<ref name=history1 /> The city of Gaborone was originally constructed as a small town, so the Gaborone Dam needed to be built to provide water for all its citizens.<ref name=phakalane />

From 2007 to 2008, {{convert|23963000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=5|lk=on}} of water was sold in Gaborone. The government sector bought the most water, {{convert|11359000|m3|cuyd |sigfig=5|lk=on}}. {{convert|8564000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=4|lk=on}} of water was bought for domestic use, and {{convert|4040000|m3|cuyd|sigfig=3|lk=on}} of water was bought by the commercial and industrial sectors. In 2008, the city of Gaborone consumed {{convert|25657363|kl|cuyd}} of water, and the water consumption per capita was {{convert|0.184|m3|cuyd|sigfig=3|lk=on}} per person per year, the lowest rate since 1999.<ref name=water />

Gaborone has some of the highest water tariffs in the country because of high transportation costs and high water consumption. The high tariffs may also be due to the fact that some of Gaborone's water supply is imported from the [[Letsibogo Dam]].<ref name=water />

The average [[pH]] of the water in the Gaborone Dam is 7.95 as of February 2006. The concentration of [[calcium]] in the reservoir was 14.87milligrams per litre from April 2001 to August 2006. During the same period, the concentration of [[calcium carbonate]] (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) was 57.73 milligrams per litre, slightly over Botswana's ideal concentration which means the water is [[hard water|hard]]. Also during the same period, the [[chloride]] concentration was 6.44&nbsp;mg/l, the [[fluoride]] concentration was 0.54&nbsp;mg/l, the [[potassium]] concentration was 6.72&nbsp;mg/l, and the [[sodium]] concentration was 10.76&nbsp;mg/l.<ref name=water />
