{{Further|History of New Jersey}}

The area of Paterson was inhabited by the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian-speaking]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[Acquackanonk tribe]] of the [[Lenape]], also known as the Delaware Indians. The land was known as the [[Lenapehoking]]. The Dutch claimed the land as [[New Netherlands]], followed by the [[British Empire|British]] as the [[Province of New Jersey]].<ref name="Passaic County">Scott, William Winfield.

===Establishment===
In 1791, [[Alexander Hamilton]] (1755/57–1804), first [[United States Secretary of the Treasury]],  helped found the [[Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures]] (S.U.M.), which helped encourage the harnessing of energy from the [[Great Falls of the Passaic River]] to secure economic independence from British manufacturers. The society founded Paterson, which became the cradle of the [[Industrial Revolution]] in America.<ref>[http://www.patersongreatfalls.org/significance.html District Significance], Paterson Friends of the Great Falls.

[[Architect]], [[engineer]], and [[Urban planner|city planner]] [[Pierre L'Enfant]] (1754–1825), who had earlier developed the initial plans for [[Washington, D.C.]], was the first planner for the S.U.M. project.<ref>{{cite book|last=Jusserand|first=Jean Jules|author-link=Jean Jules Jusserand |chapter=Major L'Enfant and the Federal City |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u2MUAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA184 |title=With Americans of Past and Present Days |page=184|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|year=1916|isbn=9780722276648}}</ref> His plan proposed to harness the power of the Great Falls through a channel in the rock and an [[Aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]. The society's directors felt he was taking too long and was over budget, and he was replaced by Peter Colt, who used a less complicated reservoir system to get the water flowing to factories in 1794. Eventually, Colt's system developed some problems and a scheme resembling L'Enfant's original plan was used after 1846.<ref>[http://www.patersongreatfalls.org/sum.html Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures], Paterson Friends of the Great Falls.

Paterson was originally formed as a [[township (New Jersey)|township]] from portions of [[Acquackanonk Township, New Jersey|Acquackanonk Township]] on April 11, 1831, while the area was still part of [[Essex County, New Jersey|Essex County]]. It became part of the newly created Passaic County on February 7, 1837, and was incorporated as a city on April 14, 1851, based on the results of a referendum held that day. The city was reincorporated on March 14, 1861.<ref name=Story>Snyder, John P.

===Industrial growth===
The {{convert|77|ft|adj=on}} high Great Falls and a system of water raceways that harnessed the falls' power provided power for the mills in the area until 1914 and fostered growth of the city.<ref>Narvaez, Alfonso A. [https://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/30/nyregion/historic-power-plant-reborn-at-the-great-falls-in-paterson.html "Historic Power Plant Reborn At The Great Falls In Paterson"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 30, 1987. Accessed April 18, 2012.</ref> The district originally included dozens of mill buildings and other manufacturing structures associated with the textile industry and, later, the firearms, silk, and [[railroad locomotive]] manufacturing industries. In the latter half of the 19th century, silk production became the dominant industry and formed the basis of Paterson's most prosperous period, earning it the nickname "Silk City."<ref>[http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/102paterson/102paterson.htm Paterson, New Jersey:America's Silk City], [[National Park Service]]. Accessed April 18, 2012. "These mills manufactured many things during the long history of this industrial city—cotton textiles, steam locomotives, Colt revolvers, and aircraft engines. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they produced silk fabrics in such quantities that Paterson was known as 'Silk City.'"</ref>

In 1835, Samuel Colt began producing firearms in Paterson, but within a few years he moved his business to [[Hartford, Connecticut]]. Later in the 19th century, Paterson was the site of early experiments with submarines by Irish-American inventor [[John Philip Holland]]. Two of Holland's early models—one found at the bottom of the Passaic River—are on display in the [[Paterson Museum]], housed in the former [[Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works]] near the Passaic Falls.<ref>Sachs, Andrea.

"The museum, for example, owns the first two submersibles built by John Philip Holland, the Father of the Modern Submarine, and 30 of the rare Colt Paterson firearms (1837–42), the third-largest collection in the world."</ref>

Behind Newark and New York, the brewing industry was booming in Paterson in the late 1800s. Braun Brewery, Sprattler & Mennell, Graham Brewery, The Katz Brothers, and Burton Brewery merged in 1890 to form [[Paterson Consolidated Brewing Company]]. [[Hinchliffe Brewing|Hinchliffe Brewing and Malting Company]], founded in 1861, produced 75,000 barrels a year from its state-of-the-art facility at 63 Governor Street. All the breweries closed during [[Prohibition]].<ref>[https://www.patersonnj.gov/egov/apps/document/center.egov?view=item&id=938 Hinchliffe Brewery], City of Paterson. Accessed July 26, 2023. "The brewing industry in Paterson was soon thereafter crippled and dissolved by the Temperance movement and prohibition era of the 1920-30s."</ref>
 
The city was a mecca for immigrant laborers, who worked in its factories, particularly Italian weavers from the Naples region. Paterson was the site of historic labor unrest that focused on the six-month-long [[Paterson silk strike of 1913]] that demanded the [[eight-hour day]] and better working conditions. It was defeated, with workers returning at the end of the strike without having negotiated any changes.<ref>Worth-Baker, Marcia. [https://njmonthly.com/articles/jersey-living/striking-out/ "Striking Out: Paterson’s Famous Labor Dispute"], ''[[New Jersey Monthly]]'', January 17, 2013. Accessed July 26, 2023. "The workers’ key demands: an eight-hour day and improved working conditions, including a return to the two-loom system.... One by one, the silk mills began to spin again without significant concessions from the owners. In the end, Steiger wrote, the strike was 'one of the most bitterly contested and wasteful contests in the history of the industries of this nation.'"</ref>

In 1919, Paterson was one of eight locations bombed by self-identified anarchists.<ref>Salerno, Salvatore.

===Post–World War II era===
During [[World War II]], Paterson played an important part in the aircraft engine industry. By the end of the war, however, urban areas were in decline; Paterson was no exception. Beginning in the late 1960s, the city suffered high unemployment rates and [[white flight]].<ref>[[James S.

According to the [[New Jersey Historical Commission]], Paterson’s industrialism ended “as the economy and technological needs of the United States changed. By 1983, Paterson was the fifth poorest city in the United States. The town that had called itself Silk City, the Iron City, and the Cotton City, was in economic ruin”.<ref>{{Cite web |title=It Happened Here New Jersey Alexander Hamilton's Dream of Industry |url=https://nj.gov/state/historical/assets/pdf/it-happened-here/ihhnj-er-hamilton.pdf |access-date=November 15, 2022 |website=nj.gov}}</ref> Once millwork and production left the city, Paterson’s poverty became reminiscent of what occurred in the towns surrounding the Appalachian Mountains once the coal mining industry ended. In 2020, 25.2% of Paterson residents lived in poverty.<ref name=Census2020/>

Competition from malls in upscale neighboring towns like [[Wayne, New Jersey|Wayne]] and [[Paramus, New Jersey|Paramus]] forced large chain stores out of Paterson's downtown. With the decline of the city's industrial base, small businesses became the city's most prominent businesses. But the city still attracts many immigrants, who have revived its economy, especially through small businesses.<ref>[http://www.shoppaterson.org/knowpaterson.html Get to Know Paterson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701022749/http://www.shoppaterson.org/knowpaterson.html |date=July 1, 2012 }}, Merchants & Businesses of Downtown Paterson.

[[File:Map Passaic County Paterson NJ.gif|thumb|left|Road map of Passaic County, with Paterson, showing rivers and lakes around towns]]

Paterson is in the southern part of Passaic County, which is near the north edge of New Jersey, as a county that spans some hilly areas and has dozens of lakes. The county covers a region about {{convert|30|xx|20 |mi|km|disp=x| wide (|)}}. The region is split by major roads, including portions of [[Interstate 80 in New Jersey|Interstate 80]], which runs through Paterson (see map ''at left)''. The [[Garden State Parkway]] (GSP) cuts across the south of Paterson, near [[Clifton, New Jersey]]. The [[Passaic River]] winds northeast past [[Totowa, New Jersey|Totowa]] into Paterson, where the river then turns south to [[Passaic, NJ|Passaic]] town, on the way to [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], further south.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]], the city had a total area of 8.71 square miles (22.55&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), including 8.41 square miles (21.79&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of land and 0.29 square miles (0.76&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) of water (3.38%).<ref name=CensusArea/><ref name=GR1 />

===Neighborhoods===
{{Paterson, New Jersey neighborhoods}}
'''The Great Falls Historic District''' is the most famous neighborhood in Paterson because of the landmark Great Falls of the Passaic River. The city has attempted to revitalize the area in recent years, including the installation of period lamp posts and the conversion of old industrial buildings into apartments and retail venues. Many artists live in this section of Paterson. A major redevelopment project is planned for this district in the coming years. The [[Paterson Museum]] of Industrial History at [[Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works]] is situated in the Historic District.<ref>[http://www.patersonnj.gov/department/division.php?fDD=8-150 Paterson Mill Survey], City of Paterson. Accessed January 27, 2015.</ref>

'''[[Downtown Paterson]]''' is the main commercial district of the city and was once a shopping destination for many who lived in [[North Jersey]]. After a devastating fire in 1902, the city rebuilt the downtown with massive [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts-style]] buildings, many of which remain to this day. These buildings are usually four to seven stories tall. Downtown Paterson is home to [[Paterson City Hall]] and the Passaic County Courthouse Annex, two of the city's architectural landmarks. City Hall was designed by the New York firm [[Carrere and Hastings]] in 1894, and was modeled after the ''[[Hôtel de Ville, Lyon|Hôtel de Ville]]'' (city hall) in [[Lyon]], [[France]], capital of the silk industry in [[Europe]].<ref>[http://www.patersonhistory.com/tours/downtown.html Walking Tour of Downtown] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319233154/http://www.patersonhistory.com/tours/downtown.html |date=March 19, 2012 }}, PatersonHistory.com.

As with many other old downtown districts in the United States, Downtown Paterson suffered as shoppers and retailers moved to the [[suburban]] shopping malls of the region. Many historic buildings are in disrepair or are abandoned after years of neglect. In addition, Downtown Paterson is an [[Urban Enterprise Zone]]. The city has, in recent years, begun initiatives in hopes of reviving the downtown area with the centerpiece being the Center City Mall, constructed on a large parking lot spanning Ward Street from Main to Church Streets and features retail, entertainment, and commercial space. Downtown Paterson is located in the city's 1st Ward.<ref>Rumley, Ed.

'''Eastside Park Historic District''' consists of about 1,000 homes in a variety of architectural styles, including [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudors]], [[Colonial Revival architecture|Georgian colonials]], [[Victorian house|Victorians]], [[Italianate architecture|Italianate villas]] and [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch colonials]]. It is located east of downtown. Once the home of the city's industrial and political leaders, the neighborhood experienced a significant downturn as industry fled Paterson. In recent years, [[gentrification]] has begun to occur in the neighborhood and some of the area's historic houses have been restored.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

The Eastside Park Historic District is a state and nationally registered historic place. The jewel of the neighborhood is Eastside Park and the mansions that surround it. This section of Paterson once had a large [[American Jews|Jewish]] population that reached 40,000 at its peak; a [[synagogue]] still remains.<ref>Hyman, Vicki.

Eastside Park at one point was home to as many as 40,000 Jews, but they decamped rapidly to burgeoning suburbs starting in the late 1950s (though Temple Emanuel, the octagonal art deco neighborhood landmark, didn't pull up roots until 2005)."</ref> Eastside Park and what is commonly known as the Upper Eastside are located in Paterson's 3rd Ward.<ref name=MasterPlan>[https://www.patersonnj.gov/egov/documents/1395155623_756225.pdf Master Plan], City of Paterson, March 2014.

'''East River Section''' is a section that is referred to by locals roughly bordering Riverside at 5th Avenue and extending south to Broadway, sandwiched in by Madison Avenue to McClean Boulevard (Route 20). However, the neighborhood's layout unofficially extends to the "Paterson-Newark/Hudson Route" of River Road in the Paterson-Memorial Park section of Fair Lawn whose house addresses are in alignment with the now-defunct Jewish synagogue on the corner of 33rd Street and Broadway, which connects Paterson to Newark/Hudson, and at one time was the main route through River Drive, which starts in Elmwood Park and rides north to south along the East Bank of the Passaic River in Paterson's original county.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

Built when Paterson was still Bergen County, River Drive changes to River Road in the greater Eastside Sections of Upper Eastside-Manor Section, East River, and Riverside Sections, and turns into Wagaraw Road north of 1st Avenue / Maple Avenue in the old Bunker Hill extension of Columbia Heights in Fair Lawn an indication of not only entering the Industrial Section but also entering the foothills of the Ramapo Mountains in Hawthorne.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

River Drive then turns into East Main Street to indicate that you have entered the Northside Section. The East River neighborhood which was and still maintains its "blue-collar" working-class identity, was at one time known for its large Jewish community, as well as a Neapolitan/Italian population and more recently other Mediterranean and Adriatic Europeans, Caribbean and South Americans, and other modern immigrant groups from all over the world, as well as African-Americans.{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

{{Main|Lambert Castle}}
Belle Vista, locally known as [[Belle Vista (Paterson, New Jersey)|Lambert Castle]], was built in 1892 as the home of [[Catholina Lambert]], the self-made owner of a prominent silk mill in Paterson. After Lambert's death in 1923, his family sold the building to the city, which in turn sold it to the County of Passaic a few years later. The county used the building for administrative offices, and in 1936, provided one room to the fledgling Passaic County Historical Society to serve as its historical museum. As time went by the museum grew, room by room until the entire first floor became the historical museum.

In the late 1990s, the Castle underwent a multi-million-dollar restoration and all four floors of the building were developed into a museum and library. Today, Passaic County remains the owner of the building and supports the facilities' operation; however, the Passaic County Historical Society is solely responsible for the operation and management of Lambert Castle Museum with its historical period rooms, long-term and changing exhibition galleries, educational programs for elementary and middle-school students, and research library/archive.<ref>[http://www.lambertcastle.org/ Lambert Castle], Passaic County Historical Society.

The Mayor appoints all department heads including the business administrator, with the advice and consent of the Council and may remove any department heads after giving them notice and an opportunity to be heard. With the assistance of the business administrator, the Mayor is responsible for the preparation of the municipal budget. The Mayor submits the budget to the Council along with a detailed analysis of expenditures and revenues. The Council may reduce any item or items in the budget by a majority vote but can only increase an item by a two-thirds vote.<ref name=Council/><ref name=DataBook/>

The City Council is comprised of nine members. Of these, six are elected through the use of the [[Ward (United States)|ward system]], where candidates run to represent a certain area of the city. The other three seats are elected using the [[at-large]] system, where each candidate is voted upon by the entire voting population of the city. Municipal elections are held in even-numbered years, are [[non-partisan democracy|non-partisan]], and take place on the second Tuesday in May. The six members of the City Council representing their wards are elected in the same years as presidential elections, while the mayoral election and the at-large Council elections are held in the same years as the mid-term Congressional elections.<ref name=Council/><ref name=DataBook/>

"Italians from that town found their way to Paterson and settled in the 21st Avenue area earlier in this century. This population increased over the years, at least in part because of the Italian practice of [[chain migration]].
