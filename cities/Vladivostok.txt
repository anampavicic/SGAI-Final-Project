Shortly after the signing of the [[Treaty of Aigun]] between [[Qing China]] and the [[Russian Empire]] and affirmed by the [[Convention of Peking]] – from which it is also known as the [[Amur Annexation]] – the city was founded as a Russian military outpost on July 2, 1860.<ref name="sj">{{Cite book |last=Paine |first=SCM |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SHIAEo_qGRIC&pg=PA69 |title=The Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895: perceptions, power, and primacy |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-521-81714-1}}{{Dead link|date=August 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> In 1872, the main Russian naval base on the Pacific Ocean was transferred to the city, stimulating its growth.

That same year, the [[Red Army]] occupied the city, absorbing the [[Far Eastern Republic]] into the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]. Following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] in 1991, the city became a part of the [[Russian Federation]].

Today, Vladivostok remains the largest Russian port on the [[Pacific Ocean]], and the chief cultural, economic, scientific, and tourism hub of the Russian Far East.

''Vladivostok'' means 'Lord of the East' or 'Ruler of the East'. The name derives from Slavic {{lang|sla|владь}} ({{lang|sla-Latn|vlad}}, 'to rule'{{efn|see [[Vladimir (name)]] for etymology}}) and Russian {{lang|ru|восток}} ({{lang|ru-Latn|vostok}}, 'east');  Colloquial Russian speech may use the short form ''Vladik'' ({{langx |ru| Владик}}) to refer to the city.<ref>{{Cite web |date=June 9, 2022 |title=Владик |url=https://ru.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BA&oldid=12344098 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230727073942/https://ru.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=%D0%92%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BA&oldid=12344098 |archive-date=July 27, 2023 |access-date=July 27, 2023 |via=Wiktionary}}</ref>{{Better source needed|reason=The current source is insufficiently reliable ([[WP:NOTRS]]).|date=March 2022}}

The city, along with other features in the [[Peter the Great Gulf]] area, was first given its modern name in 1859 by [[Nikolay Muravyov-Amursky]]. The name initially applied to the bay, but following an expedition by [[:ru:Шефнер, Алексей Карлович|Alexey Karlovich Shefner]] in 1860, it was later applied to the new settlement.<ref>В. В.

For a long time, the Russian government looked for a stronghold in the [[Far East]]; this role was played in turn by the settlements of [[Okhotsk]], [[Ayan, Russia|Ayan]], [[Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky]], and [[Nikolaevsk-on-Amur]]. By the middle of the 19th-century, the search for the outpost had reached a dead end.

=== Early history ===
On October 31, 1861, the first civilian settler, a merchant, Yakov Lazarevich Semyonov, arrived in Vladivostok with his family. On March 15, 1862, the first act of his purchase of land was registered, and in 1870 Semyonov was elected the first head of the post, and a local self-government emerged.<ref name="Vladivostok 2010" /> By this time, a special commission decided to designate Vladivostok as the main port of the [[Russian Empire]] in the Far East.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Юрий Уфимцев |title=Основание Владивостока |url=http://oldvladivostok.ru/articles/?a=281&s=123 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211005904/http://oldvladivostok.ru/articles/?a=281&s=123 |archive-date=December 11, 2015 |access-date=September 15, 2020 |publisher=oldvladivostok.ru}}</ref> In 1871, the main naval base of the Siberian Military Flotilla, the headquarters of the military governor and other naval departments were transferred from Nikolaevsk-on-Amur to Vladivostok.<ref name="history1">{{Cite web |date=February 7, 2010 |title=Владивосток: история города |url=https://ria.ru/20100702/251565235.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115060316/https://ria.ru/20100702/251565235.html |archive-date=November 15, 2019 |access-date=September 15, 2020 |website=RIA Novosti}}</ref>

In the 1870s, the government encouraged resettlement to the South Ussuri region, which contributed to an increase in the population of the post: according to the first census of 1878, there were 4,163 inhabitants. The city status was adopted and the city Duma was established, the post of the city head, the coat of arms was adopted, although Vladivostok was not officially recognized as a city.<ref name="history1" />

Due to the constant threat of attack from the [[Royal Navy]], Vladivostok also actively developed as a naval base.

In 1880, the post officially received the status of a city. The 1890s saw a demographic and economic boom associated with the completion of the construction of the Ussuriyskaya branch of the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] and the [[Chinese-Eastern Railway]].<ref name="history1" /> According to the first census of the population of Russia on February 9, 1897, roughly 29,000 inhabitants lived in Vladivostok, and 10 years later the city's population had tripled.<ref name="history1" /> Korean [[haenyeo]] divers from [[Jeju Island]] and vicinities were active in Vladivostok.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Koh |first=Mi |date=December 30, 2014 |title=Jeju haenyo spreading through Asia |url=http://islandstudies.net/weis/weis_2014v04/v04n3_Koh_Jeju.pdf |url-status=live |journal=World Environment and Island Studies |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=38 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230517154522/http://islandstudies.net/weis/weis_2014v04/v04n3_Koh_Jeju.pdf |archive-date=May 17, 2023 |access-date=May 17, 2023}}</ref>

The first decade of the 20th-century was characterized by a protracted crisis caused by the political situation: the government's attention was shifted to [[Lüshunkou District|Lüshunkou]] and the Port of [[Dalian]] (Talien). As well as the [[Boxer Rebellion|Boxer uprising]] in North China in 1900–1901, the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904–1905, and finally the first Russian revolution led to stagnation in the economic activity of Vladivostok.<ref name="history2">{{Cite web |date=2008 |title=Особенности промышленно-экономического развития Владивостока в начале XX века |url=http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/osobennosti-promyshlenno-ekonomicheskogo-razvitiya-vladivostoka-v-nachale-xx-veka |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808015042/http://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/osobennosti-promyshlenno-ekonomicheskogo-razvitiya-vladivostoka-v-nachale-xx-veka |archive-date=August 8, 2016 |access-date=September 15, 2020 |website=CyberLeninka}}</ref>

Since 1907, a new stage in the development of the city began: the losses of Lüshunkou and Dalian (Talien) again made Vladivostok the main port of Russia on the [[Pacific Ocean]]. A free port regime was introduced, and until 1914 the city experienced rapid growth, becoming an important economic hub in the [[Asia-Pacific]], as well as an ethnically diverse city with a population exceeding over 100,000 inhabitants: during the time ethnic Russians made up less than half of the population,<ref name="history2" /> and large [[Asian people|Asian]] communities developed in the city.

Vladivostok City Duma's history dates from November 21, 1875, when 30 "vowels" were elected. Great changes took place after the 1917 Revolution, when the first general elections were held and women were allowed to vote. The last meeting of the Vladivostok City Duma took place on October 19, 1922, and on October 27 it was officially abolished. In Soviet times, its functions were performed by the City Council. In 1993, by a presidential decree, the Soviets were dissolved and, until 2001, all attempts to elect a new Duma were unsuccessful. The Duma of the city of Vladivostok of the fifth (current) convocation began work in the fall of 2017, consisting of 35 deputies.<ref>{{Cite web |date=December 11, 2015 |title=Дума города Владивостока празднует 140-летие |url=http://www.vlc.ru/news/2015/141513/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807044732/http://www.vlc.ru/news/2015/141513/ |archive-date=August 7, 2016 |access-date=October 10, 2020 |publisher=Официальный сайт Администрации города Владивостока}}</ref>

==Economy==
The city's main industries are [[shipping]], commercial [[fishing]], and the [[naval base]]. Fishing accounts for almost four-fifths of Vladivostok's commercial production. Other food production totals 11%.

This has included raising tariffs for imported cars, which has put the car import business in Vladivostok in difficulties. To compensate, Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] ordered the car manufacturing company [[Sollers JSC|Sollers]] to move one of its factories from Moscow to Vladivostok. The move was completed in 2009, and the factory now employs about 700 locals. It is planned to produce 13,200 cars in Vladivostok in 2010.<ref name="rad_stats" />

The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was built to connect [[European Russia]] with Vladivostok, Russia's most important [[Pacific Ocean]] port. Finished in 1905, the rail line ran from Moscow to Vladivostok via several of Russia's main cities. Part of the railway, known as the [[Chinese Eastern Line]], crossed over into China, passing through [[Harbin]], a major city in Manchuria. Today, Vladivostok serves as the main starting point for the Trans-Siberian portion of the [[Eurasian Land Bridge]].[[File:Vladivostok_Railway_station_P8050426_2200.jpg|thumb|[[Vladivostok railway station]]]]Vladivostok is the main air hub in the Russian Far East. [[Vladivostok International Airport]] (VVO) is the home base of [[Aurora (airline)|Aurora]], a subsidiary of [[Aeroflot]]. The airline was formed by [[Aeroflot]] in 2013 by amalgamating [[SAT Airlines]] and [[Vladivostok Avia]]. The [[Vladivostok International Airport]] was significantly upgraded in 2013 with a new {{convert|3,500|m|adj=on|sp=us}}-long runway capable of accommodating all aircraft types without any restrictions. The ''Terminal A'' was built in 2012 with a capacity of 3.5 million passengers per year.

==Sports==
[[File:Fetisov Arena 20171224.jpg|thumb|[[Fetisov Arena]] in Vladivostok in December 2017]]
Vladivostok is home to the football club [[FC Dynamo Vladivostok|Dynamo Vladivostok]], which plays in the [[Russian Second Division]], ice hockey club [[Admiral Vladivostok]] from the [[Kontinental Hockey League]]'s [[Chernyshev Division]], and basketball club [[Spartak Primorye]], of the [[Russian Basketball Super League]]. Former [[Russian Premier League]] football club [[FC Luch Vladivostok|Luch Vladivostok]] used to be the main football team of the city until its bankruptcy in 2020. It is also home to the [[Vostok Vladivostok]] [[motorcycle speedway]] club.

Vladivostok annually hosts various contests. In 2022, the 35th Regatta boat for the Goblet of Peter the Great and the 19th Russian Championship of Conrad-25R yachts were held.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Первые гонки регаты «Кубок залива Петра Великого» завершились победой экипажей из Владивостока и Находки (ФОТО) – Новости Владивостока на VL.ru |url=https://www.newsvl.ru/sport/2022/08/21/211556/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221004135430/https://www.newsvl.ru/sport/2022/08/21/211556/ |archive-date=October 4, 2022 |access-date=October 4, 2022 |website=www.newsvl.ru}}</ref>

==Pollution==
{{see also|Animal welfare and rights in Russia|Siberian fur trade|List of power stations in Russia}}
Local ecologists from the ''Ecocenter'' organization have claimed that much of Vladivostok's suburbs are [[pollution|polluted]] and that living in them can be classified as a [[health hazard]].{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The pollution has a number of causes, according to ''Ecocenter'' geochemical expert Sergey Shlykov. Vladivostok has about eighty industrial sites, which may not be many compared to Russia's most industrialized areas, but those around the city are particularly environmentally unfriendly, such as [[shipbuilding in Russia|shipbuilding]] and repairing, power stations, printing, [[fur farming]], and [[mining in Russia|mining]].

In addition, Vladivostok has particularly vulnerable geography which compounds the effect of pollution. Winds cannot clear pollution from some of the most densely populated areas around the Pervaya and Vtoraya Rechka as they sit in basins which the winds blow over. In addition, there is little snow in winter and no leaves or grass to catch the dust to make it settle down.<ref name="Ecocenter">{{Cite web |last1=Preobrazhensky |first1=B.

==Geography==
[[File:Txu-oclc-6614368-nk52-3.jpg|right|thumb|Vladivostok (1955)]]
[[File:Txu-pclmaps-oclc-22834566 f-10d.jpg|right|thumb|Vladivostok and surrounding region ([[Defense Mapping Agency|DMA]], 1988)]]
The city is located in the southern extremity of [[Muravyov-Amursky Peninsula]], which is about {{convert|30|km|sp=us}} long and {{convert|12|km|sp=us}} wide.

The highest point in the city is [[Mount Kholodilnik]], at {{convert|257|m|sp=us}}. [[Eagle's Nest Hill]] is often called the highest point in the city, but with a height of {{cvt|199|m}}, or {{cvt|214|m}} according to other sources, it is only the highest point in the city center, not the whole city.

Located in the extreme southeast of the Russian Far East, in the extreme southeast of [[North Asia]], Vladivostok is geographically closer to [[Anchorage, Alaska]], US and even [[Darwin, Australia]] than it is to the nation's capital of [[Moscow]]. Vladivostok is also closer to [[Honolulu, Hawaii]], US than to the city of [[Sochi]] in [[Southern Russia]]. It also is further east than any area south of it in China<!-- China's only portion east of the city is in the north --> and the entire Korean peninsula.

===Climate===
Vladivostok has a monsoon-influenced [[humid continental climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Dwb'') with warm, humid and rainy summers and cold, dry winters. Owing to the influence of the [[Siberian High]], winters are much colder than a latitude of 43 degrees should warrant, given its low elevation and coastal location, with a January average of {{convert|-11.9|C}}. Winter temperatures are somewhat colder than [[Milwaukee]] and far colder than [[Florence]]; all 3 locations are at or above 43 degrees north latitude. They are even colder than those of [[Moscow]] and [[Minneapolis]], interior locations at 56 and 45 degrees north, respectively. Since the maritime influence is strong in summer, Vladivostok has a relatively cold annual climate for its latitude.

In winter, temperatures can drop below {{convert|-20|C}} while mild spells of weather can raise daytime temperatures above freezing. The average monthly precipitation, mainly in the form of snow, is around {{convert|18.5|mm|sp=us}} from December to March. Snow is common during winter, but individual snowfalls are light, with a maximum snow depth of only {{convert|5|cm|sp=us}} in January. During winter, clear sunny days are common.

Summers are warm, humid and rainy, due to the East Asian [[monsoon]]. The warmest month is August, with an average temperature of {{convert|+20|C}}. Vladivostok receives most of its [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] during the summer months, and most summer days see some rainfall. Cloudy days are fairly common and because of the frequent rainfall, humidity is high, on average about 90% from June to August.

During the summer season, the city is prone to [[typhoons]] and [[tropical storms]]. [[Typhoon Sanba]] struck the city as a tropical storm in 2012. In [[Artyom, Russia|Artyom]], near Vladivostok, more than {{cvt|300|ha|acre}} of crops were inundated. Preliminary losses over the region were estimated to be [[Russian ruble|₽]]40&nbsp;million (US$1.29&nbsp;million).<ref>{{Cite news |date=September 19, 2012 |script-title=ru:Ущерб фермерам Приморья от тайфуна "Санба" оценивается в 40 млн руб |url=https://www.interfax-russia.ru/far-east/news/ushcherb-fermeram-primorya-ot-tayfuna-sanba-ocenivaetsya-v-40-mln-rub |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220527231635/https://www.interfax-russia.ru/far-east/news/ushcherb-fermeram-primorya-ot-tayfuna-sanba-ocenivaetsya-v-40-mln-rub |archive-date=May 27, 2022 |access-date=September 19, 2012 |publisher=Interfax |language=ru}}</ref> Typhoons can be rare, but tropical storms happen from the [[Sea of Japan]] after a typhoon landfall from [[South Korea]] and [[Japan]].

On average, Vladivostok receives {{convert|840|mm|sp=us}} of precipitation per year, but the driest year was 1943, when {{convert|418|mm|sp=us}} of precipitation fell, and the wettest was 1974, with {{convert|1272|mm|sp=us}} of precipitation. The winter months from December to March are dry, and in some years they have seen no measurable precipitation at all. Extremes range from {{convert|-31.4|C}} in January 1931 to {{convert|+33.6|C}} in July 1939.<ref name="pogoda">{{Cite web |script-title=ru:Климат Владивостока |trans-title=Climate of Vladivostok |url=http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/31960.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227214532/http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/31960.htm |archive-date=December 27, 2016 |access-date=June 19, 2013 |website=Погода и Климат (Weather and Climate) |language=ru}}</ref>
