'''Djibouti Region''', also known formerly as '''Djibouti District''', is the capital of the [[Republic of Djibouti]] and one of the six regional administrative divisions of the country. With 777,000 residents across a total area of about 80 square miles (200 km2), Djibouti Region is the most populous in Djibouti. It is the smallest region in Djibouti, and contains the national capital, [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]].

==History==
Ambouli in the Djibouti Region is identifies the city with Canbala by [[O.G.S. Crawford]]. Canbala appears in [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]]'s map of 1192 on the coast of the [[Horn of Africa]], southeast of the straits of [[Bab-el-Mandeb]], and with Cambaleh, a town where the Venetian traveler Bragadino, a thirteenth-century European visitor to [[Ethiopia]], resided for eight years.<ref>O.G.S. Crawford, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1789985 "Some Medieval Theories about the Nile", ''Geographical Journal''], '''114''' (1949), p. 8</ref> In the mid-19th century and earlier, Djibouti Region was ruled by local authorities with whom France signed various treaties between 1883 and 1887 to first gain a foothold in the region.

==Demographics==
About 70% of Djibouti's population lives in the coastal plain, much of them in the [[Djibouti City]] area.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Djibouti: Regions, Major Cities & Towns - Population Statistics, Maps, Charts, Weather and Web Information |url=https://www.citypopulation.de/en/djibouti/ |access-date=2024-09-08 |website=www.citypopulation.de}}</ref><ref name=CIA>{{cite web|title=Djibouti|url=https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/djibouti/|work=The World Factbook|publisher=CIA|access-date=February 26, 2013|date=February 5, 2013}}</ref>

==Geography==
===Topography===
The region borders the [[Arta Region]] to the south and west, and to the north [[Gulf of Tadjoura]]. The landscape around the region, along the Djibouti's coastal plain, is a [[semi-desert]]. It is a geographical [[region]] defined [[Geomorphology|morphologically]] by the [[sea]], in terms of topography and soil, and also in its climate, flora and fauna.

===Vegetation===
The region has a rich in plant species partly because of its diversity of habitats, including beaches, mangroves and semi-arid lands. The most prevalent plant communities are the [[Cenchrus ciliaris|African foxtail grass]], [[Urochondra]], [[Panicum turgidum]]  and [[Acacia tortilis]].

===Climate===
[[File:Map of Djibouti Region.png|thumb|right|350px|Map of Djibouti Region.]]

Djibouti Region has an [[Semi-arid climate]]. It is characterised by very hot rainless [[summer]]s and a very warm, slightly wetter [[winter]] season. Most of the annual precipitation falls between October and May. In [[Djibouti City]] sees on average 163.5 millimetres (6.44&nbsp;in) of rainfall per year. Average high temperatures range from 29&nbsp;°C (84&nbsp;°F) during the months of December, January and February, to about 42&nbsp;°C (108&nbsp;°F) in July. The topography of the region has [[coastal plain]], there are two seasons: a hot dry season from May to October and a cooler season with more precipitation from November to April (winter). The rainfall on the [[coast]] usually occurs between November and March, whereas further inland it falls between April and October. In the summer months, temperatures routinely exceed 40&nbsp;°C (104&nbsp;°F), with relative [[humidity]] at its lowest point of the year. It is lowest during the [[rainy]] period, when there is some coastal [[fog]] and greater cloud coverage as warm air passes over the cool [[sea]] surface. However, precipitation is highly variable and long periods without any rainfall occur throughout the year. Unusual episodes of heavy rain sometimes occur, with a maximal 224 millimetres (8.82&nbsp;in) falling in November 1949.
