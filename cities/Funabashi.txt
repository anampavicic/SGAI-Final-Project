==History==
The name "Funabashi" is mentioned in the [[Kamakura period]] chronicle ''[[Azuma Kagami]].'' However, the name itself is even more ancient, dating from before the [[Nara period]] and the [[Yamatotakeru]] mythology. Archaeologists have found stone tools from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period and [[shell midden]]s from the [[Jōmon period]] in the area, indicating continuous inhabitation for thousands of years. A number of [[Shinto shrine]]s and [[Buddhist temple]]s in the area claim to have been founded in the [[Nara period]] or [[Heian period]]. During the [[Muromachi period]]s, the area was controlled by the [[Chiba clan]]. During the [[Sengoku period]], the Chiba clan fought the [[Satomi clan]] to the south, and the [[Late Hōjō clan]] to the west. After the defeat of the Chiba clan, the area came within the control of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the area prospered as a [[shukuba|post town]] on the river crossing of the [[Tone River]], and was largely retained as ''[[tenryō]]'' under the direct control of the Shogunate and administered through a number of {{lang|ja-latn|[[hatamoto]]}}. The area was also a favored hunting grounds for the Shōgun. During the [[Boshin War]] of the [[Meiji Restoration]], Funabashi was the location of a minor skirmish between Tokugawa loyalists under [[Enomoto Takeaki]] and the pro-Imperial forces of  [[Okayama Domain]] and [[Satsuma Domain]], during which most of the town burned down.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

After the [[abolition of the han system]], the area eventually became part of Chiba Prefecture. Funabashi Town was one of several towns and villages created on April 1, 1889, under [[Inba District, Chiba|Inba District]] with the establishment of the modern municipalities system. The area developed rapidly due to its proximity to Tokyo and the presence of numerous military facilities in the area. On April 1, 1937, Funabashi was elevated to city status through merger with neighboring Katsushika Town and Yasakae, Hoden and Tsukada Villages. The new city was host to numerous military installations in World War II, and was bombed in the [[air raids on Japan]] in 1945.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The city developed rapidly in the postwar period, with the development of industries, public housing developments and port facilities.  With the annexation of neighboring Ninomiya Town in 1953, the population exceeded 100,000. The population exceeded 300,000 in 1969 and 500,000 in 1982. Funabashi was designated a [[Core cities of Japan|core city]] on April 1, 2005, with increased local autonomy from the central government. The population exceeded 600,000 in 2006.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==Government==
Funabashi has a [[mayor-council]] form of government with a directly elected mayor and a [[unicameral]] city council of 50 members. Funabashi contributes seven members to the Chiba Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the city is divided between the [[Chiba 4th district]] and the [[Chiba 14th district]] of the [[House of Representatives of Japan|lower house]] of the [[Diet of Japan]].

==Economy==
Funabashi is a regional commercial center and, due to its numerous train connections, a [[bedroom community]] for nearby Chiba and Tokyo. Approximately 34.5% of the working population commutes to Tokyo, per the 2015 census.
