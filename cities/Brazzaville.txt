In 2013, Brazzaville was designated a [[City of Music (UNESCO)|City of Music]] by [[UNESCO]]; since then it has also been a member of the [[Creative Cities Network]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://news.un.org/en/story/2013/10/453392-brazzaville-zahle-krakow-and-fabriano-designated-unesco-creative-cities |title=Brazzaville, Zahlé, Kraków and Fabriano designated UNESCO Creative Cities |date=2013-10-21 |work=UN News |access-date=2018-10-03 |language=en |archive-date=4 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181004021133/https://news.un.org/en/story/2013/10/453392-brazzaville-zahle-krakow-and-fabriano-designated-unesco-creative-cities |url-status=live }}</ref>

==Geography==
[[File:Kindepuisbrazza.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kinshasa]] seen from Brazzaville. The two capitals are separated by the [[Congo River]].]]
[[File:brazzaville, Republic of the Congo.jpg|thumb|View of Brazzaville from space]]
Brazzaville covers a large area to the north of the [[Congo River]], just below the [[Pool Malebo]]. [[Mbamu]], a large island within the Pool, is part of the Republic of Congo's territory.

Brazzaville is {{cvt|506|km|mi|0|abbr=off}} inland from the Atlantic Ocean and approximately {{cvt|474|km|mi}} south of the [[equator]]. Around the city are large plains. The town is relatively flat, and situated at an altitude of {{cvt|317|m|ft|0|abbr=off}}. Downriver the Congo has numerous rapids, known as Livingston Falls, preventing navigation upriver to this point from its mouth at the Atlantic.

[[Kinshasa]], the capital of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is located on the southern bank of the Congo, directly across from Brazzaville. To distinguish between the two African countries that have "Congo" in their names, the Republic of the Congo is sometimes called Congo-Brazzaville, as opposed to Congo-Kinshasa. Kinshasa is more than five times larger than Brazzaville in population. This is the only place in the world where two national [[capital city|capital cities]] developed on opposite banks of a river, within sight of each other.<ref name=Guardian1>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jan/17/congo-rivalry-kinshasa-brazzaville-river-drc |title=Face-off over the Congo: the long rivalry between Kinshasa and Brazzaville |website=[[TheGuardian.com]] |date=17 January 2017 |access-date=15 July 2017 |archive-date=18 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170718224203/https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/jan/17/congo-rivalry-kinshasa-brazzaville-river-drc |url-status=live }}</ref>

In March 2018, the "Brazzaville Declaration" was signed to promote better management and conservation of the [[Cuvette Centrale]], a region in [[Congo Basin]] and primarily in DRC. It is the world's largest tropical [[peatland]], made up of swamp forests. Conservation of this area is important for the survival of megafauna, and also critical to the world's climate. Burning the peat would release too much carbon and raise the Earth's temperature. The declaration to save peatlands as the world's largest terrestrial organic carbon stock was signed by [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], the [[Republic of the Congo]], and [[Indonesia]], which also has peatlands.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/historic-agreement-signed-protect-worlds-largest-tropical-peatland |title=Historic agreement signed to protect the world's largest tropical peatland |website=UNEP - UN Environment Programme |date=23 March 2018 |access-date=29 May 2020 |archive-date=31 July 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200731101616/https://www.unenvironment.org/news-and-stories/press-release/historic-agreement-signed-protect-worlds-largest-tropical-peatland |url-status=live }}</ref>

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of Brazzaville}}
[[File:Brazzaville-Le Marché.jpg|thumb|left|Brazzaville Market in 1905]]
[[File:Gare de Brazzaville en 1941.jpg|thumb|left|Brazzaville railway station in 1941]]

Brazzaville was founded by the [[French colonial empire]] upon an existing indigenous [[Bateke]] settlement called Ncuna, during the [[Scramble for Africa]] when European nations established spheres of influence on the continent.<ref name=Scramble1>{{cite book |last=Pakenham |first=Thomas |date=1991 |title=The Scramble for Africa |publisher=Abacus |page=150}}</ref> The Italian-born explorer [[Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza]],<ref name="EB1911"/> who was granted French citizenship in 1874, officially founded the settlement on 10 September 1880; it commemorates his name.<ref name="cybriwsky2013"/><ref name=Scramble1/>

The local [[King]], Makoko of the Téké, signed a treaty of protection with Brazza, which subjugated his lands to the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]].<ref name=Scramble1/> From October 1880 until May 1882, a small squad of troops led by Senegalese Sergeant [[Malamine Camara]] occupied the site, in order to prevent the land from falling into Belgian hands. Their forces were active on the south side of the river, where King Leopold II ruled the Belgian Congo for a period as a private holding. The first large-scale building work of the city began four years later, as the French competed with [[Léopoldville]] (now [[Kinshasa]]) which Belgian colonists were developing on the south side of the river.<ref name=Scramble1/>

The [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884 placed French control over this area on an official footing. The city became the capital of the [[French Congo]] in 1904.<ref name=Encyc1>{{cite book |last=Thomas |first=Dominic |date=2005 |title=Encyclopedia of Twentieth-Century African History |publisher=Routledge}}</ref> It continued as capital when [[French Equatorial Africa]] was founded in 1910, as a federation of French colonial states: it included [[Gabon]], the [[Central African Republic]], and [[Chad]] until 1960.<ref name=Encyc1/> From 1910 to 1915 the major municipal buildings were constructed, including a courthouse and headquarters for the Banque de l'AEF and Institut Pasteur.<ref name=YoulouDianzinga2006>Jean-Jacques Youlou & Scholastique Dianzinga, "Une capitale dans l'histoire"; Chapter 1 in ''Ziavoula'' (2006).</ref>

In 1934, the [[Congo–Ocean Railway]] opened, linking Brazzaville with the Atlantic port of [[Pointe-Noire]] and bypassing the rapids on the Congo River. Construction of the railway resulted in the deaths of more than 17,000 Africans, and the people revolted against the French in 1928.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14121195 |title=Republic of Congo profile |date=11 April 2017 |publisher=BBC |access-date=22 June 2018 |archive-date=7 March 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307054339/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14121195 |url-status=live }}</ref>

During World War II, Brazzaville and the rest of [[French Equatorial Africa]] remained beyond the control of [[Vichy France]], which served the Nazi occupation. The city served as the capital of [[Free France]] from 1940 to 1943.<ref name=YoulouDianzinga2006 /> In 1944, Brazzaville hosted a meeting of the [[French resistance]] forces and representatives of France's African colonies. The resulting [[Brazzaville Conference of 1944|Brazzaville Declaration]] represented an attempt to redefine the relationship between France and its African colonies.<ref name=Encyc1/>

Until the 1960s, the city was divided into European (the centre of the city) and [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] sections ([[Poto-Poto]], Bacongo, and Makélékélé). In 1980, it became a "[[Communes of the Republic of the Congo|commune]]" separated from the surrounding [[Pool Department]] and divided into nine "[[arrondissements]]" along the French model of administration.

Since the late 20th century, the city has frequently been a staging ground for wars, including internal conflicts between rebel and government forces. It has been a base of conflicts between forces of the Republic of the Congo, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), and [[Angola]]. During the 1990s, civil wars resulted in thousands of civilian deaths here and forced hundreds of thousands of refugees to flee the city.

More recently thousands of people leaving the DRC have made their way to Brazzaville; the [[MONUSCO|local United Nations force]] and the DRC government have accused the city of deporting thousands of these refugees.<ref>"[http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/deportation-comments-anger-congo-1695433 Deportation comments anger Congo] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181125085135/https://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/deportation-comments-anger-congo-1695433 |date=25 November 2018 }}", ''Independent Online'' (SAPA-AFP), 28 May 2014.</ref><ref>James Butty, "[https://www.voanews.com/a/drc-threatens-legal-action-over-brazzaville-deportations/1923224.html DRC Threatens Legal Action over Deportations from Congo-Brazzaville] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710131336/https://www.voanews.com/a/drc-threatens-legal-action-over-brazzaville-deportations/1923224.html |date=10 July 2017 }}", ''VOA News'', 27 May 2014.</ref>

==Economy==
The location of Brazzaville near the pool of the Congo River enabled it to grow as an industrial, trading and port settlement. It was connected through trade by ships and boats traveling upriver to inland areas, which produced raw materials from the beginning of the colonial period.<ref name=Encyc1/> Construction of the railway connecting to [[Pointe-Noire]] increased the ability of city businessmen to get their products to the port for export. Industries present in Brazzaville include [[machining|machine shops]], [[textile]]s, [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]], and [[manufacturing]]. As a key port on the [[Congo River]], Brazzaville still takes deliveries of [[raw material]]s, such as [[natural rubber|rubber]], [[wood]], and [[agriculture|agricultural product]]s. From here they are generally sent onward to [[Pointe-Noire]] for export.

Many companies, government organizations and [[NGO]]s have regional offices in the capital city, where they can work with government officials. The [[World Health Organization]] has its regional office for Africa located in Brazzaville.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.who.int/about/regions/afro/en/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040714010025/http://www.who.int/about/regions/afro/en/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 July 2004 |title=WHO &#124; Regional Office for Africa |website=WHO}}</ref> Companies headquartered in Brazzaville include [[Equatorial Congo Airlines]]{{Cn|date=September 2024}}and the mobile operator [[Warid Congo]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=79599058 |title=Company Overview of Warid Congo S.A. |website=[[Bloomberg News]] |access-date=16 July 2017 }}</ref>

==Culture==
[[Roger Erell]], a highly regarded architect, designed a house in the city for [[Charles de Gaulle]] when he was the leader of [[Free France]] here. Other buildings include the Pierre Savorgnan de Brazza Mausoleum, the [[Nabemba Tower]], and the Congressional Palace (Brazzaville).

The [[Marien Ngouabi]] Mausoleum, [[Brazzaville Zoo]], and the Poto-Poto School of Painting are also destinations for visitors and city residents.

==Places of worship==
[[File:Cathédrale de Brazzaville avant 1926.jpg|thumb|right|The Sacred Heart Cathedral in 1926]]
Many Congolese converted to Catholicism during the French colonial period. [[Christianity|Christian]] churches are most prevalent in the city, where the Roman Catholic Church has an [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Brazzaville|archdiocese]]. Since then, churches have been established by new immigrants and by local adoption of evangelical Protestantism. Examples include the [[Basilica of Sainte-Anne-du-Congo in Brazzaville]], Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Brazzaville and Gabon ([[Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Patriarchate of Alexandria and All Africa]]), [[Evangelical Church of Congo]] ([[World Communion of Reformed Churches]]), and [[Assemblies of God]].<ref>J.

==Climate==
Brazzaville features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]]. Its wet season, which runs from October–May, is longer than its dry season, which covers the remaining months. Brazzaville's driest months, July and August, on average have no significant precipitation. Since Brazzaville is south of the equator, its dry season begins at around its "winter" solstice, which is the month of June. The city has relatively consistent temperatures throughout the course of the year.

The city is home to [[Maya-Maya Airport]], which lies in the centre of the city and which has regular flights to [[Pointe-Noire]] as well as international destinations in Africa, Europe and the Middle East. A flight operates twice weekly between Brazzaville and Kinshasa, but the flight time is only five minutes.<ref name=Guardian1/>

The [[Congo-Ocean Railway]] has a station in the city and in 2014 was operating the [[La Gazelle train|''La Gazelle'']] train service every other day to [[Pointe-Noire]] and intermediate destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/forums/africa/congo/la-gazelle-train-brazzaville-to-pointe-noire |title=La Gazelle train Brazzaville to Pointe Noire |first=Lonely |last=Planet |access-date=4 May 2014 |archive-date=4 May 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140504190134/https://www.lonelyplanet.com/thorntree/forums/africa/congo/la-gazelle-train-brazzaville-to-pointe-noire |url-status=live }}</ref>

[[File:WPWPCG 38.jpg|thumb|Road transport in Brazzaville]]
The city is an important [[river port]], with [[ferry|ferries]] sailing to [[Kinshasa]] and to [[Bangui]] via [[Impfondo]].<ref name=Guardian1/> Ferries and fast private boats serve as the primary means of connection between Kinshasa and Brazzaville.<ref name=Guardian1/> The [[Livingstone Falls]] lie on the outskirts of the city, where the [[Djoué River]] meets the Congo, rendering river transport to the coast impossible, qualifying the railway as a [[portage railway]].

Although there is no organised public transport system, privately owned buses are available in the capital.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/congo/brazzaville/transport/getting-around |title=Transport in Brazzaville - Lonely Planet Travel Information |access-date=2014-09-27 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125191943/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/congo/brazzaville/transport/getting-around |archive-date=25 January 2010}}</ref>

Taxis are available on every street and are easily recognized, being painted with a green body and white top, and the fare for a short trip is CF700. About twenty percent of the vehicles in Brazzaville are taxis. There are also collective taxis that drive certain routes and charge CF150.

[[Brazzaville–Kinshasa Bridge|A road-rail bridge]] is proposed to connect Brazzaville with Kinshasa. The rail gauge on both sides is the same at 1067mm.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.au-pida.org/view-project/2014/ |title=Road-Rail Bridge |date=17 June 2017 |access-date=8 September 2020 |archive-date=18 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201018085725/https://www.au-pida.org/view-project/2014/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
