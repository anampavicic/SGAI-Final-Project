The city was settled in the 10th century by the [[Janggala|Kingdom of Janggala]], one of the two [[Java]]nese kingdoms that was formed in 1045 when [[Airlangga]] abdicated his throne in favor of his two sons. In the late 15th and 16th centuries, Surabaya grew to be a [[Duchy of Surabaya|duchy]], a major political and military power as well as a port in eastern Java, probably under the [[Majapahit]] empire.<ref name="Howard" /> At that time, Surabaya was already a major trading port, owing to its location on the [[Brantas River|River Brantas]] delta and the trade route between [[Malacca]] and the [[Spice Islands]] via the [[Java Sea]]. During the decline of Majapahit, the lord of Surabaya resisted the rise of the [[Demak Sultanate]] and only submitted to its rule in 1530.{{sfn|Pigeaud|1976|p=16}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|2008|p=39}} Surabaya became independent after the death of Sultan Trenggana of Demak in 1546.{{sfn|Pigeaud|1976|p=28}}{{sfn|Akhmad Saiful Ali|1994|p=32}}

== Name ==
Surabaya, from the [[Javanese language|Javanese]] "{{lang|jv|sura ing baya}}", means "bravely facing danger";<ref name="EastJava" /> originally from the union of [[Pali]] words ''"[[wikt:असुर|sura]]"'', referring to the "''Asura''" ([[Asura (Buddhism)|Buddhism]] beliefs), and ''"[[wikt:भय|bhaya]]"'', referring to "fear", "perils" or "danger". This name for Surabaya alludes to a prophecy of [[Jayabaya]], a 12th-century psychic king of [[Kediri Kingdom]], whose name means ''"conquering the fear or perils"'' derived from the [[Pali]] words ''"Jaya"'' or ''"Vijaya"'' (victory or conqueror) and ''"bhaya"'' (fear, perils or danger). Jayabaya foresaw a fight between a giant [[Great white shark|white shark]] and a giant white [[Saltwater crocodile|crocodile]] taking place in the area.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.goodnewsfromindonesia.id/2016/02/26/asal-nama-surabaya-bukan-hiu-dan-buaya |title=Asal Nama "Surabaya", Ternyata bukan Hiu dan Buaya |last=Hananto|first=Akhyari|website=Good News From Indonesia|language=id|access-date=2019-01-03 }}</ref>

The event is sometimes interpreted as foretelling the [[Mongol invasion of Java]], a major conflict between the forces of [[Kublai Khan]], [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] ruler of [[Yuan Dynasty|China]], and those of [[Raden Wijaya]]'s [[Majapahit]] on 31 May 1293,<ref name="Irwan Rouf & Shenia Ananda 60">{{cite book |title=Rangkuman 100 Cerita Rakyat Indonesia dari Sabang sampai Merauke: Asal Usul Nama Kota Surabaya|author= Irwan Rouf & Shenia Ananda|publisher=MediaKita| language=id| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cPJqcwuSOUkC&pg=PA64|page=60|isbn=9786029003826|access-date=17 November 2014|date= 2013-01-01}}</ref><ref name="EastJava">{{cite web|title=Welcome to Surabaya City, East Java|publisher=Surabaya Tourism, EastJava.com |url=http://www.eastjava.com/tourism/surabaya/|access-date=17 November 2014}}</ref> which is now considered the date of the city's founding.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Graf |first1=Arndt |last2=Chua |first2=Beng Huat |author-link2=Chua Beng Huat |title=Port Cities in Asia and Europe |date=2008 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-135-78478-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SFORAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT165 }}</ref>

The two animals are now used as the city's symbol, with the two facing and circling each other, as depicted in a statue appropriately located near the entrance to the [[Surabaya Zoo|city zoo]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jalanjalanyuk.com/patung-suro-dan-boyo-di-surabaya/|title=Patung Suro dan Boyo di Surabaya {{!}} Jalan Jalan Yuk!|website=www.jalanjalanyuk.com|access-date=2019-01-05}}</ref>

Some people consider [[Jayabaya]]'s prophecy as being about the [[Battle of Surabaya|great war]] between native Surabayan people and foreign invaders at the start of the war of independence in 1945. Another story tells of two heroes who fought each other to be the king of the city. The two heroes were named Sura and Baya. These [[folk etymologies]], though embraced enthusiastically by its people and city leaders, are unverifiable.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://suaramuslim.net/soerabaia-tempo-doeloe-lambang-kota-surabaya/|title=Soerabaia Tempo Doeloe "Lambang Kota Surabaya"|last=Suaramuslim.net|date=2018-06-01|website=Suara Muslim|language=id|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>

== History ==
{{Further|Timeline of Surabaya}}

=== Early history ===
The Kingdom of [[Janggala]] was one of the two [[Java]]nese kingdoms that were formed in 1045 when [[Airlangga]] abdicated the throne of the [[Kingdom of Kahuripan]] in favor of his two sons. The earliest historical record of Surabaya was in the 1225 book ''[[Zhu fan zhi]]'' written by [[Zhao Rugua]], in which it was called Jung-ya-lu.<ref name="ReferenceA">F. Hirth and W.W. Rockhill, Chau Ju-kua, St Petersburg, 1911</ref> The name Janggala is derived from the name "Hujung Galuh" (Old Javanese lit: "Cape Diamond" or "Cape Gemstone"), or "Jung-ya-lu" according to Chinese sources. Hujung Galuh was located on the estuary of [[Brantas River]] and today is part of modern Surabaya city and [[Sidoarjo Regency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://duniakeris.com/bagaimana-bika-ujung-galuh-bukan-surabaya-kini/|title=Bagaimana Bika Ujung Galuh Bukan Surabaya Kini|last=duniakeris|date=2018-01-19|website=DUNIA KERIS-US|access-date=2019-01-05}}</ref>

By the 14th and 15th centuries, Surabaya was one of the [[Majapahit]] ports or coastal settlements, together with [[Tuban]], [[Gresik Regency|Gresik]], and Hujung Galuh (Sidoarjo). [[Ma Huan]] documented the [[Treasure voyages|early 15th-century visit]] of [[Zheng He]]'s [[Chinese treasure ship|treasure ships]] in his 1433 book ''[[Yingya Shenglan]]'': "after travelling south for more than 20 ''li'', the ship reached ''Sulumayi'', whose foreign name is Surabaya.

Ma Huan visited Java during Zheng He's fourth expedition in 1413, during the reign of Majapahit king [[Wikramawardhana]]. He describes his travel to the Majapahit capital. He first arrived at the port of ''Tu-pan'' (Tuban) where he saw large numbers of Chinese settlers migrated from [[Guangdong]] and [[Zhangzhou]]. Then, he sailed east to the thriving new trading town of ''Ko-erh-hsi'' (Gresik), ''Su-pa-erh-ya'' (Surabaya), and then sailing inland into the river by smaller boat to the southwest until he reached the Brantas river port of ''Chang-ku'' (Changgu). Continuing to travel by land to the southwest, he arrived in ''Man-che-po-I'' (Majapahit), where the Javanese king stayed.<ref name="Chao-Wa">{{cite web|author2=JVG Mills|author1=Ma Huan |title=Ying-yai Sheng-lan, The Overall Survey of the Ocean's Shores | year=1970 |work= Washington.edu| pages=86–97 (Country of Chao–Wa) |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/qing/huan_ying-yai_sheng-lan%5B1%5D.pdf}}</ref>

=== Pre-colonial era ===

The Surabaya area was once the main gateway to the capital of the Majapahit Kingdom from the sea, at the mouth of [[Kalimas River|''Kali Mas'' river]]. The anniversary of the city of Surabaya was set on May 31, 1293, commemorating the victory of the Majapahit led by [[Raden Wijaya]] against the [[Mongol invasion of Java|Mongol invasion]]. Mongol troops who came from the sea were described as SURA (sharks / brave) and Raden Wijaya's troops who came from the land were described as BAYA (crocodiles / danger), literally translating to brave to face the dangers that come threatening. So the day of victory is commemorated as the anniversary of Surabaya.

By the late 15th century, [[Islam]] began to take its root in Surabaya. The settlement of [[Ampel]], located around [[Ampel Mosque]] in today's Ampel subdistrict, Semampir district, north Surabaya, was established by Islamic proselytiser [[Sunan Ampel]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pecintaulama.id/2017/10/sejarah-singkat-masjid-agung-sunan-ampel-surabaya.html|title=Sejarah Singkat Masjid Agung Sunan Ampel (MASA) Surabaya|last=ID|first=Pecinta Ulama|website=Pecinta Ulama|access-date=2019-01-03}}</ref>

In the late 15th and 16th centuries, Surabaya grew to a [[Duchy of Surabaya|duchy]], a major political and military power in eastern Java. The Portuguese writer [[Tomé Pires]] mentioned that a Muslim lord was in power in Surabaya in 1513, though likely still a vassal of the Hindu–Buddhist Majapahit.{{sfn|Pigeaud|1976|p=16}} By that time, Surabaya was already a major trading port,{{sfn|Ricklefs|2008|p=43}} owing to its location on the Brantas River delta and the trade route between [[Malacca]] and the [[Spice Islands]] via the [[Java Sea]].{{sfn|Akhmad Saiful Ali|1994|p=31}} During the decline of Majapahit, the lord of Surabaya resisted the rise of the [[Demak Sultanate]] and only submitted to its rule in 1530.{{sfn|Pigeaud|1976|p=16}}{{sfn|Ricklefs|2008|p=39}} Surabaya became independent after the death of Sultan [[Trenggana]] of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]] in 1546.{{sfn|Pigeaud|1976|p=28}}{{sfn|Akhmad Saiful Ali|1994|p=32}}

Following the collapse of [[Demak Sultanate|Demak]], Surabaya was conquered by the [[Mataram Sultanate]], under the leadership of ''[[Panembahan Senopati]]'' in 1598, and invaded by ''Panembahan Seda ing Krapyak'' in 1610, An article by the VOC in 1620 described Surabaya as a rich and powerful region.''<ref>[[M. C. Ricklefs]], ''A History of Modern Indonesia since c. 1200'', 2008</ref>''

The Duchy of Surabaya entered conflict with and was later [[Mataram conquest of Surabaya|captured]] by the more powerful [[Sultanate of Mataram]] in 1625 under [[Sultan Agung of Mataram|Sultan Agung]].<ref name="Drakeley">Drakeley S. ''The History of Indonesia''. Greenwood, 2005. {{ISBN|9780313331145}}</ref>{{rp|31}} It was one of Mataram's fiercest campaigns, in which they had to conquer Surabaya's allies, Sukadana and [[Madura]], and to lay siege to the city, blocking the flow of the Brantas River, Sultan Agung forced Surabaya to surrender. With this conquest, Mataram then controlled most of Java, except the [[Banten Sultanate]] and the Dutch settlement of [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]].<ref name=Drakeley />{{rp|31}}

=== Colonial era ===
[[File:Coat of Arms of Surabaya (1931).svg|thumb|Coat of Arms of Soerabaja (old spelling of Surabaya) during Dutch colonial era, granted in 1931]]

The expanding [[Dutch East India Company]] took over the city from a weakened Mataram in November 1743. In consolidating its rule over Surabaya and, in time, the rest of East Java, the Dutch collaborated with leading regional magnates, including [[Soero Pernollo|Ngabehi Soero Pernollo]] (1720–1776), his brother [[Han Bwee Kong]], [[Kapitein der Chinezen]] (1727–1778), and his nephew, [[Han Chan Piet]], Majoor der Chinezen (1759–1827), all from the powerful [[Han family of Lasem]].<ref name="Margana (2007)">{{cite book|last1=Margana|first1=Sri|title=Java's last frontier : the struggle for hegemony of Blambangan, c. 1763–1813|date=2007|publisher=TANAP|location=Leiden|pages=210–236|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/handle/1887/12547|access-date=17 February 2016}}</ref><ref name="Salmon (1997)">{{cite journal|last1=Salmon|first1=Claudine|title=La communauté chinoise de Surabaya.

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Surabaya was largest city in the Dutch East Indies, becoming a major trading center and hosting the most extensive naval base in the colony. Surabaya also served as the center of Java's plantation economy, industry, supported by its natural harbor.<ref>{{cite book |author1=Peter James Rimmer |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-oIyKT1MOA4C&pg=PA32 |title=The City in Southeast Asia: Patterns, Processes and Policy |author2=Howard W.

During the Dutch East Indies era, Surabaya was the capital of the Surabaya Residency, whose territory encompasses what is now the [[Gresik Regency|Gresik]] Regency, [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]], [[Mojokerto]], and [[Jombang Regency|Jombang]]. In 1905, Surabaya received the status of municipality (gemeente). In 1926, Surabaya was designated the capital of the province of East Java. Since then Surabaya developed into the second largest city in the [[Dutch East Indies]] after [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]].

Before 1900, the city center of Surabaya revolved around the ''Jembatan Merah''; ({{langx|en|Red Bridge}}). In 1910, a modern port facility was built in Surabaya, now known as Tanjung Perak Harbor. Until the 1920s, new settlements such as Darmo, Gubeng, Fields, and Ketabang grew.

In 1920, a census recorded that Batavia had become the largest city. In 1917, a revolt occurred among the soldiers and sailors of Surabaya, led by the [[Indies Social Democratic Association]]. The revolt was firmly crushed, and the insurgents were given harsh sentences.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/sebelum-pki-berdiri-lingkaran-kaum-sosialis-di-surabaya-cxw9|title=Sebelum PKI Berdiri: Lingkaran Kaum Sosialis di Surabaya|last=Achdian|first=Andi|website=tirto.id|date=30 September 2017 |language=id|access-date=2019-01-05}}</ref>

=== Independence era ===
[[Empire of Japan|Japan]] occupied the city in 1942, as part of the [[Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies]], and it was bombed by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] in 1944. After the [[surrender of Japan]] at the end of [[World War II]], Surabaya was seized by Indonesian nationalists. The young nation soon came into conflict with the British, who had become caretakers of the Dutch colony after the Japanese surrender.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.endofempire.asia/japanese-hand-over-power-in-surabaya-and-yogyakarta/|title=Japanese hand over power in Surabaya and Yogyakarta|date=2015-10-02|website=End of Empire-US|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>

The [[Battle of Surabaya]], started after the ''Arek-Arek Suroboyo'' (Teenagers of Surabaya) killed British Brigadier [[Aubertin Walter Sothern Mallaby|Aubertin Mallaby]] on 30 October 1945, near ''Jembatan Merah'', allegedly with a stray bullet. The Allies gave an ultimatum to the Republicans inside the city to surrender, but they refused. The ensuing battle, which cost thousands of lives, took place on 10 November, which Indonesians subsequently celebrate as ''Hari Pahlawan'' (Heroes' Day). The [[Hotel Yamato Incident|incident]] of the red-white flag (the [[Dutch flag]] at the top of Yamato Hotel's tower that was torn into the Indonesian red-white flag) by [[Bung Tomo]] is also recorded as a heroic feat during the struggle over the city.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indonesianpod101.com/lesson/culture-class-holidays-in-indonesia-18-indonesian-memorial-day/|title=Indonesian Memorial Day|website=IndonesianPod101|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>

The city is known as ''Kota Pahlawan'' (the city of heroes) due to the importance of the Battle of Surabaya in galvanising Indonesian and international support for [[Indonesian independence]] during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalindonesianvoices.com/17298/hari-pahlawan-battle-of-surabaya-the-story-behind-indonesias-heroes-day/|title=[Hari Pahlawan] Battle of Surabaya, the Story behind Indonesia's Heroes Day|date=2014-11-09|website=Global Indonesian Voices – GIV-US|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>

=== Modern history ===
After [[Indonesian National Revolution|the independence era]], population growth and rapid urbanization forced Surabaya to develop towards the east and west as it is today. The increase in vehicles, the growth of new industries and the proliferation of housing carried out by real estate companies occupying the outskirts of the city have resulted in traffic jams not only in the downtown area but also frequently in the suburbs. Surabaya grew from a relative poor city in the late 19th century into a metropolis in the late 20th century, and became one of the fastest growing metropolitan areas in Southeast Asia. Surabaya also managed to become one of the most organized metropolitan cities in Indonesia with the cleanest air.

On 13 May 2018, three churches in Surabaya and one apartment complex in the neighboring regency of Sidoarjo [[Surabaya bombings|were bombed]] in a series of terrorist attacks initiated by [[Jamaah Ansharut Daulah]], the Southeast Asian branch of [[ISIS]], followed by a bombing on Surabaya Police Department HQ the next day. 28 people were killed, including the assailants. 57 people were injured; several of whom where in a critical condition.

The first confirmed case of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in [[East Java]] was in Surabaya, on 17 March 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.suarasurabaya.net/kelanakota/2020/gubernur-afirmasi-enam-kasus-positif-covid-19-pertama-di-jatim/|title=Khofifah Benarkan Kasus Positif COVID-19 Pertama di Jatim|website=Suara Surabaya|language=id-ID|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200417155121/https://www.suarasurabaya.net/kelanakota/2020/gubernur-afirmasi-enam-kasus-positif-covid-19-pertama-di-jatim/|archive-date=2020-04-17|access-date=2020-04-17}}</ref> In May 2020, Surabaya became the epicenter of the pandemic in Indonesia.

The city is referred to as ''Kota Pahlawan'' (the city of heroes) due to the significance of the [[Battle of Surabaya]] during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]]. The city is one of the important financial, commercial, industrial, transportation, and entertainment hubs of the archipelago.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://republika.co.id/share/ozjlmv|title=Surabaya Siap Jadi Penghubung Perdagangan Indonesia Timur|date=2017-11-17|website=Republika Online|language=id|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> Arguably the second most significant city after Jakarta, the city is also home to Indonesia's second-busiest seaport, the [[Port of Tanjung Perak]], which is located in northern Surabaya.

[[File:Wisma Intiland (30277155100).jpg|thumb|Wisma Intiland, most famous [[Brutalist architecture]] in Surabaya. It is one of the last buildings designed by [[Paul Rudolph (architect)|Paul Rudolph]].]]

Architecture in Surabaya is a mixture of colonial, Asian, Javanese, modern, and post-modern influences. There are many colonial-era relics still standing today, such as [[Hotel Majapahit]] and Surabaya Post Office. As a relatively old city in Indonesia and [[Southeast Asia]], most colonial buildings were built around the 17th century to the early 20th century.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dreamofacity.com/2012/09/19/the-colonial-city-or-old-town-west-surabaya/|title=The Colonial City, or Old Town West – Surabaya|last=Ting|first=Kennie|date=2012-09-19|website=Dream of a City|access-date=2019-01-05}}</ref> These buildings show the influence of Dutch or European style in the Middle Ages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.detik.com/berita-jawa-timur/d-3679805/mengenal-bangunan-kolonial-belanda-surabaya-karya-estourgie|title=Mengenal Bangunan Kolonial Belanda Surabaya Karya Estourgie|last=Alda|first=Michelle|website=detiknews|language=id|access-date=2019-03-04}}</ref>

Before the [[World War II|Second World War]], there were many shophouses in the old part of the city, mostly two-storey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mondasiregar.com/postcards-from-surabaya/|title=Keunikan Kota Tua Surabaya|last=Monda|date=2016-02-21|website=Berbagi Kisahku-US|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref> They display the influence of European and Chinese traditions. Although some have been dismantled for new construction, there are still many old buildings that are preserved as cultural heritage and city icons, which are around the area of Kembang Jepun Street, Karet Street, Gula Street, Slompretan Street, and Rajawali Street.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.idntimes.com/travel/destination/habibah-sofi/bangunan-tua-di-surabaya-c1c2|title=10 Bangunan Tua Ini Bukti Surabaya Punya Warisan Sejarah yang Epik|last1=Times|first1=I.

After the independence of Indonesia, the center of Surabaya's architectural development was concentrated only in the area of Jembatan Merah and its surroundings. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, modern and post-modern style buildings were increasingly emerging in Surabaya. Along with economic development, such buildings have continued to grow. In the 2010s, Surabaya has become a center of [[skyscraper]]s and [[High-rise building|high-rises]] in East Java and central regions of Indonesia, such as The Peak Residence – Tunjungan Plaza 6 (215 meters) and One Icon Residence – Tunjungan Plaza 5 (200 meters).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tirto.id/parade-gedung-pencakar-langit-bDws|title=Parade Gedung Pencakar Langit|last=Suhendra|website=tirto.id|date=24 August 2016 |language=id|access-date=2019-01-05}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
Surabaya features a [[tropical wet and dry climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Aw''), with distinct [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season]]s. The city's wet season runs from October through May, while the dry season covers the remaining four months. Unlike many cities and regions with a tropical wet and dry climate, average high and low temperatures are very consistent throughout the year, with an average high temperature of around 31&nbsp;°C and average low temperatures around 23&nbsp;°C. Summer months (December to February) are the wettest months, while spring months (September to November) are the hottest months.

== Government ==
[[File:Surabaya City Hall by Yamin Nathaniel.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Surabaya City Hall]] at dusk]]
The city has its own local government and legislative body. The mayor and members of representatives are locally elected by popular vote for a five-year term. The city government enjoys greater decentralisation of affairs than the provincial body, such as the provision of public schools, public health facilities, and public transportation. The current mayor of the city is [[Eri Cahyadi]], who has served the city since 26 February 2021. The city's first female mayor is [[Tri Rismaharini]], who has led Surabaya to achieve many regional, national and international awards since her first term began in 2010. In 2012, Surabaya was awarded the "ASEAN Environmentally Sustainable City Award". Besides Mayor and Vice Mayor, there is the [[Surabaya City Regional House of Representatives]], which is a legislative body of 50 council members directly elected by the people in legislative elections every five years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jatim.bps.go.id/statictable/2016/07/25/344/jumlah-anggota-dewan-perwakilan-rakyat-daerah-menurut-kabupaten-kota-dan-jenis-kelamin-di-provinsi-jawa-timur-2015.html|title=Jumlah Anggota Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah Menurut Kabupaten/Kota dan Jenis Kelamin di Provinsi Jawa Timur, 2015|last=BPS Provinsi Jawa Timur|website=jatim.bps.go.id|language=id|access-date=2019-03-06}}</ref>

Surabaya is divided into thirty-one [[Districts of Indonesia|''kecamatan'']] (districts),<ref name="Surabaya City Regulation No. 5 2006">{{Cite web|url=http://www.surabaya.go.id/pdf/perda/perda2006/2006-05.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928002540/http://www.surabaya.go.id/pdf/perda/perda2006/2006-05.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Surabaya City Regulation No. 5 2006|archive-date=September 28, 2007}}</ref><ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011">Biro Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 2011.</ref> and subdivided into 154 [[Villages of Indonesia|''kelurahan'']] (urban villages). The districts are grouped into five areas: Central, North, South, East, and West. The districts are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census<ref name="Biro Pusat Statistik 2011"/> and the 2020 Census,<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2021"/> together with their official estimates as at mid 2023.<ref name="Badan Pusat Statistik 2024">Badan Pusat Statistik, Jakarta, 28 February 2024, ''Kota Surabaya Dalam Angka 2024'' (Katalog-BPS 1102001.3578)</ref> The table also includes the locations of the district administrative centres, and the number of [[administrative village]]s (all classed as urban ''kelurahan'') in each district.

== Economy ==
Since the early 1900s, Surabaya has been one of the most important and busiest trading city ports in Asia.<ref name="world-guides.com"/> Principal exports from the port include [[sugar]], [[tobacco]], and [[coffee]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=epW9ZWZ_fsUC&pg=PA60|title=An Economic History of Indonesia: 1800–2010|last1=Zanden|first1=Jan Luiten van|last2=Marks|first2=Daan|date=2013-05-02|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-45460-8}}</ref> Its rich history as a trading port has led to a strong financial infrastructure with modern economic institutions such as banks, insurance, and sound export-import companies. The economy is influenced by the recent growth in international industries and the completion of the [[Suramadu Bridge]]. The high potential and economic activities make the city an attractive destination to foreign investors.
The city is home to a large [[shipyard]] and numerous specialized naval schools.<ref name="surabaya.go.id"/> The [[Bank of Indonesia]] has also made plans for Surabaya to be the Islamic financial center of Indonesia.<ref name="Primadhyta"/><ref name="Indonesia"/>

[[File:Under construction of Tunjungan Plaza 5 and 6.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Tunjungan]], main [[central business district]] of Surabaya]]
As the provincial capital, Surabaya has numerous offices and business centers; as a metropolitan city, it became the center of economic, financial, and business activities in East Java and beyond. Also, Surabaya is the second-largest port city in Indonesia after Jakarta.  As a trading center, Surabaya is not only a trade center for East Java, but also facilitates areas in [[Central Java]], [[Kalimantan]], and Eastern Indonesia. Surabaya's strategic location in almost in the center of Indonesia and just south of Asia makes it one of the critical hubs for trading activities in Southeast Asia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodnewsfromindonesia.id/2018/05/31/surabaya-kota-ujung-tombak-poros-maritim-indonesia|title=Surabaya, Kota Ujung Tombak Poros Maritim Indonesia|last=Ramadhan|first=Bagus|website=Good News From Indonesia|language=id|access-date=2019-01-05}}</ref> It is currently in the process of building high-rise skyscrapers, including apartments, condominiums, and hotels to attract foreign capital. Surabaya and the surrounding area are undergoing the most rapidly growing and the most advanced economic development in Indonesia. The city is also one of the most essential cities in supporting Indonesia's economy.

Most of the population is engaged in services, industry, and trade. Surabaya is a fast-growing trading center. Major industries include shipbuilding, heavy equipment, food processing and agriculture, electronics, home furnishings, and handicrafts. Many major multinational companies are based in Surabaya, such as [[Sampoerna]], [[Maspion]], [[Wings Group]], [[Unilever Indonesia]], [[Pakuwon Mall|Pakuwon Group]], [[Jawa Pos|Jawa Pos Group]], and [[PT PAL Indonesia|PAL Indonesia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.daftarperusahaan.com/area/surabaya|title=Daftar Perusahaan di Surabaya, Profil Perusahaan di Surabaya|website=www.daftarperusahaan.com|access-date=2019-01-05}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.qerja.com/journal/view/12218-catat-inilah-perusahaan-dan-startup-sukses-asal-surabaya-eu09/|title=Perusahaan dan Startup Asal Surabaya|date=2018-09-27|website=Qerja-US|access-date=2019-01-05}}</ref>

[[File:Pakuwon Trade Centre Ekspansi (30632349775).jpg|thumb|220px|[[Pakuwon Mall]] is the largest mall in Surabaya and also in Indonesia, followed by [[Tunjungan Plaza]]]]
Surabaya has plenty of shopping centers like other major cities of Indonesia, ranging from traditional markets to most modern shopping malls. Outlets of local and international brands have a presence in modern shopping malls. There were about 100 hectares/one million square metres of retail space in Surabaya by the end of 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://properti.kompas.com/read/2016/07/13/193042621/luar.biasa.luas.seluruh.mal.di.surabaya.tembus.96.7.hektar|title=Luar Biasa, Luas Seluruh Mal di Surabaya Tembus 96,7 Hektar|newspaper=Kompas|access-date=9 May 2018}}</ref> There are many dedicated markets for electronic goods, gadgets and computer hardware.

== Infrastructure ==
[[File:Jembatan_Kenjeran_pada_malam_hari_di_tahun_2018.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Kenjeran Bridge]] during night with dancing fountain]]
Until 2009, the growth of road length in Surabaya was only about 0.01% per year. This is not comparable to the growth of motorized vehicles which reaches around 7–8% annually. Congestion that occurred in Surabaya was triggered by the growth of vehicles that were not proportional to the capacity of the road. To reduce congestion, the city government has built many new roads, including the construction of a frontage road on Ahmad Yani road which is divided into east and west sides of 4&nbsp;km each. This slow lane is planned to penetrate to the Buduran area, [[Sidoarjo Regency]]. In addition, the municipal government has completed the construction of the Middle East Ring Road (MERR) or Dr. Ir. H. Soekarno Boulevard, which is a 10.98&nbsp;km ring road between the Kenjeran area to Tambak Sumur that connects the [[Suramadu Bridge]] and [[Juanda International Airport]]; and the 780-meter Suroboyo Bridge that crosses the sea which is now a tourist icon in the Kenjeran Beach area. The city government has also intensified the construction of massive box culverts in Surabaya to reduce congestion while anticipating flooding.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Tri |first1=Rismaharini|date=1 March 2013 |title=PENGEMBANGAN INFRASTRUKTUR KOTA SURABAYA, ANTARA PROBLEM DAN SOLUSI|url=https://atpw.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/paper-keynote-risma-ok.pdf |journal=ATPW|volume= |issue=Departemen Teknik Infrastruktur Sipil Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember |pages= |doi= |access-date=21 October 2013}}</ref>

[[File:Suramadu_Bridge_5.JPG|thumb|220px|''[[Suramadu Bridge]]'', Indonesia's longest sea-bridge]]
The municipal government is also working on the construction of two new ring roads, namely the 17&nbsp;km Outer East Ring Road (OERR) between the Kenjeran area to Gunung Anyar which also connects the Suramadu Bridge and [[Juanda International Airport]] and the West Outer Ring Road ( West Outer Ring Road (WORR) along 26.1&nbsp;km between the Romokalisari area to Lakarsantri which connects the southern area of Surabaya with Teluk Lamong Harbor Terminal. In addition to building the ring road, the city government has completed the construction of an underpass on Jalan Mayjen Sungkono, and plans to build an underpass and flyover on Jalan Ahmad Yani. The problem of flooding is also a serious threat to city residents. To anticipate the occurrence of flooding, the city government has built many pump houses spread across several points in Surabaya, including Mulyorejo and Jemursari. In addition to pump houses, the city government has also built many parks that are used as sources of water absorption as well as areas for residents to interact, as well as carry out intensive cleaning and maintenance of major rivers in Surabaya. To accommodate the needs of pedestrians and tourists, the Surabaya city government has built bicycle lanes on many protocol roads in Surabaya, as well as pedestrian paths that are almost evenly distributed throughout the Surabaya area.

=== Highways ===
[[File:Waru Interchange and City of Tomorrow Superblocks, bordering with Surabaya and Sidoarjo (July 2018)..jpg|thumb|Birdview of Waru interchange at night]]
The highways that are connected to Surabaya are the [[Surabaya–Gresik Toll Road|Surabaya-Gresik]] segment which connects Surabaya with Gresik and the northern part of East Java, [[Surabaya–Mojokerto Toll Road|Surabaya-Mojokerto]] which connects Surabaya with the western part of the province, [[Surabaya–Gempol Toll Road|Surabaya-Gempol]] which connects Surabaya with the southern part of the province, as well as [[Waru–Juanda Toll Road|Waru-Juanda Airport]] which connects Surabaya with Juanda International Airport.

The [[Suramadu Bridge]] (abbreviated of '''''Sura'''''baya-'''''Madu'''''ra) connects Surabaya and [[Madura Island]] over the Madura Strait. A {{convert|16|km}} highway has been proposed to be built from the Suramadu Bridge to Madura International Seaport-City in Pernajuh village, Kocah district, [[Bangkalan]], [[Madura]] at the cost of approximately Rp. 60&nbsp;billion (US$7&nbsp;billion). This container port was built to ease the burden on Surabaya's overloaded Tanjung Perak Port.<ref name="The Jakarta Post">{{cite web |url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/28/surabaya%E2%80%99s-hotel-business-boom-%E2%80%98likely-continue%E2%80%99.html |title=Surabaya's hotel business boom "likely to continue" |work=The Jakarta Post |access-date=2013-03-04 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530040439/http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/04/28/surabaya%E2%80%99s-hotel-business-boom-%E2%80%98likely-continue%E2%80%99.html |archive-date=2013-05-30 }}</ref>

=== Transportation ===
[[File:Map Transport of Surabaya.png|thumb|220px|upright|The map of Transport of Surabaya as per September 2024]]
Transportation in Surabaya is supported by land and sea infrastructure serving local, regional, and international journeys. Air transport is located at [[Juanda International Airport|Juanda Airport]], at [[Sedati]], [[Sidoarjo Regency|Sidoarjo]]. Intracity transport is primarily by motor vehicles, motorcycles and taxis with limited public bus transport available.

These are the pioneers of association football in Surabaya. The clubs then took management under Oost Java Voetbalbond (OJVB) in 1907. Two years later, the OJVB changed to ''Soerabajasche Voetbalbond'' (SVB). Starting in 1914, SVB was based on the Nederlandsch Indische Voetbalbond (NIVB), created by [[Royal Dutch Football Association|Dutch football federation]] (KNVB). The Surabaya [[Chinese Indonesians|Chinese]] and native people also founded their association football clubs by ethnicity. Oei Kwie Liem founded Hoa Soerabaja in 1914, while the Bumiputera through R Pamoedji and Paidjo founded the ''Soerabajasche Indonesische Voetbalbond'' (SIVB) on 18 June 1927 (now Persebaya), which three years later co-founded the [[Football Association of Indonesia|PSSI]].<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WakCSQAACAAJ|title=Tionghoa Surabaya dalam sepak bola, 1915–1942|last=Aji|first=Rojil Nugroho Bayu|date=2010|publisher=Ombak|isbn=9786028335294|language=id}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

A new team emerged from Surabaya, NIAC Partners and the Salim Group Association. Besides Galatama, PSSI also formed a women's soccer competition called the Women's Football League (Galanita). Surabaya also has a women's soccer team, which was founded in 1977 and named Puteri Puspita. Clubs from Surabaya have also gained attention from the rest of the world. Persebaya has competed against European teams including Lokomotiv Moscow, Sturm Graz, Grasshoppers, Salzburg, Stade de Reims, Ajax Amsterdam, PSV Eindhoven, AC Milan, and lastly, Queens Park Rangers (QPR). Aside from European teams, there are several national teams outside the country competing against Persebaya, including Yugoslavia Olympics, Malaysia, Mozambique, Uruguay, Thailand, South Korea, and the Japanese national team.<ref name=":1" />

[[Mitra Kukar F.C.|NIAC Mitra]] also competed against Arsenal and won the [[Aga Khan Gold Cup]] competition in 1979 in Bangladesh.

However, NIAC Partners officially dissolved and withdrew from the Galatama competition held by PSSI in 1990 because they considered the policies issued by PSSI irrelevant. After being disbanded, the demands of the Surabaya community to revive the NIAC Partners were channelled when the Jawa Pos party weighed in and changed the name of the NIAC Partner to the Surabaya Partner.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Saksono|first1=Devana Bramantya|last2=Santoso|first2=Edy Budi|date=2015-06-01|title=Niac Mitra Surabaya: Potret Pasang Surut Kesebelasan Sepak Bola Tahun 1979–1990|url=http://journal.unair.ac.id/VERLEDEN@niac-mitra-surabaya:-potret-pasang-surut-kesebelasan-sepak-bola-tahun-1979-1990-article-11006-media-47-category-8.html|journal=Verleden}}</ref> When the Union competition was merged with Galatama in 1994, the new Persebaya was able to win in 1997 and 2004.
