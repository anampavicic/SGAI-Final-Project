'''Yangzhou''' is a [[prefecture-level city]] in central [[Jiangsu]] Province, [[East China]]. Sitting on the north bank of the [[Yangtze]], it borders the provincial capital [[Nanjing]] to the southwest, [[Huai'an]] to the north, [[Yancheng]] to the northeast, [[Taizhou, Jiangsu|Taizhou]] to the east, and [[Zhenjiang]] across the river to the south. Its population was 4,559,797 at the [[2020 Chinese census|2020 census]] and its urban area is home to 2,635,435 inhabitants, including three urban districts, currently in the agglomeration.

Historically, Yangzhou was one of the wealthiest cities in China, known at various periods for its great merchant families, poets, artists, and scholars. Its name (<small>lit.</small> "Rising Prefecture") refers to its former position as the capital of the ancient [[Yangzhou (ancient China)|Yangzhou prefecture]] in [[Administration of territory in dynastic China|imperial China]]. Yangzhou was one of the first cities to benefit from one of the earliest [[World Bank]] loans in China, used to construct Yangzhou [[thermal power station]] in 1994.<ref name="wb">{{cite web |title=Project documents and reports – Yangzhou thermal power project |url=http://projects.worldbank.org/P003641/yangzhou-thermal-power-project?lang=en |website=projects.worldbank.org/ |publisher=World Bank |access-date=5 November 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Worldbank report – 1994 – Yangzhou thermal power plant loan |url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/712531468743979065/pdf/multi0page.pdf |publisher=World Bank |access-date=5 November 2018}}</ref>

==Administration==
{{See also|List of administrative divisions of Jiangsu}}

Currently, the [[prefecture-level city]] of Yangzhou administers six [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#County level|county-level divisions]], including three [[District (PRC)|districts]], two [[county-level cities]] and one [[County (People's Republic of China)|county]]. Accordingly, they are further divided into 98 [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China#Township level|township-level divisions]], including 87 [[town of China|towns]] and [[Township (People's Republic of China)|townships]], and 11 [[Subdistricts of China|subdistrict]]s.

==History==
===Ancient China===
During the [[Spring and Autumn period]] of the [[Eastern Zhou dynasty|Eastern Zhou]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasty]], the [[Five Hegemons|hegemon]] [[Fuchai of Wu|Fuchai]] of [[Wuguo|Wu]] constructed the [[Han Canal|Han]] or [[Hangou Canal]] {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|邗溝}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|邗沟}}}},}} ''Hángōu'') to improve his supply lines from his center of power around present-day [[Suzhou]] to the [[North China Plain]], where he was engaged in an ongoing conflict with [[Qiguo|Qi]]. Taking advantage of the many streams and lakes of the [[Jianghuai Plain]], the canal connected the [[Yangtze River]] within present-day Yangzhou to the [[Huai River]] within present-day [[Huai'an]] by 486{{nbsp}}BC. The next year, Fuchai established a fortress to protect the southern end of the new canal at '''Hancheng'''. Following the [[Chinese urban design]] principles of the time, it was constructed as a 3 [[li (unit)|li]] by 3 [[li (unit)|li]] square{{sfnp|Schinz|1996}} about {{convert|12|m|sp=us|abbr=on}} above the water level on the Yangtze's northern [[riverbank|bank]], with the Han Canal forming a [[moat]] around the southern and eastern sides of the city. The town was intended to stall any possible counterattack from Qi down the canal, giving time to raise reinforcements from Suzhou and Wu's other lands in the [[Yangtze Delta]].

===Imperial China===
Under the [[Eastern Han dynasty]], the area was organized as the [[Guangling Commandery]] of [[Xu Province]]. Its seat of government{{mdash}}also known as '''Guangling'''{{mdash}}was also near the confluence of the Yangtze and the Han Canal, although at a slightly different location than the former Wu fortress.

Under the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]], Guangling was reorganized as [[Yang Province]] (''[[zhou (administrative division)|zhou]]'') in the year AD 590.{{cn|date=October 2022}} Its seat of government took the new name as well. Prospering as the [[Emperor Yang of Sui|Emperor Yang]] (r.{{nbsp}}604–617) connected the Han Canal to other waterways north and south to form the core of the [[Grand Canal of China|Grand Canal]], Yangzhou became the southern capital of China under the name '''Jiangdu'''.{{cn|date=October 2022}} With the failure of [[Goguryeo–Sui War|his invasions]] of [[Goguryeo|Korea]] and a series of natural disasters, Emperor Yang abandoned to north entirely in 616 and made Jiangdu his primary capital until his assassination in 618.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

Restoring the former name Guangling, the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] made the city a major port for foreign trade and turned it into a leading economic and cultural center. Many foreign merchants lived in the city,<ref>{{cite book

Jiangdu served briefly as the capital of a [[Wu (Ten Kingdoms)|revived Wu Kingdom]] during the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].

After the 1127 [[Jingkang Incident]] led to the [[Jurchen people|Jurchen]]-led [[Jurchen Jin|Jin]] conquest of [[Kaifeng]], the [[Song dynasty|Song]] used Yangzhou as their capital in 1128 and 1129.<ref name=mote/><ref>{{cite book|first=Charles|last=Holcombe|title=A History of East Asia: From the Origins of Civilization to the Twenty-First Century|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-51595-5|page=129}}</ref> Song troops under [[Du Chong]] {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|杜|充}}}},}} ''Dù Chōng'', d.{{nbsp}}1141) breached the southern [[levee|embankments]] of the [[Yellow River]] in an effort to stop the southward of [[Jin–Song Wars|Jin army]], but the resulting [[avulsion (river)|avulsion]] caused the river to swing south of the [[Shandong Peninsula]] and [[stream capture|capture]] the [[Si River]] and lower [[Huai River|Huai]].

In 1280, during the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]], Yangzhou was the site of a massive [[gunpowder]] explosion when the bomb warehouse of the [[Weiyang District, Yangzhou|Weiyang]] arsenal accidentally caught fire. The blast killed over a hundred guards, hurled debris from buildings into the air that landed 10 [[li (unit)|li]] away, and could be felt 100 [[li (unit)|li]]. [[Marco Polo]] claimed to have served [[Kubilai Khan]] in Yangzhou shortly thereafter, variously placed at 1282–1285<ref name="Perkins">{{Cite book|last=Perkins|first=Dorothy|title=Encyclopedia of China: The Essential Reference to China, Its History and Culture|publisher=Roundtable Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8160-4374-3}}</ref> or 1282–1287. Although some versions of Polo's memoirs imply that he was the governor of Yangzhou, it is more likely that he was an official in the salt industry if he was employed there at all. Surviving Chinese texts do not mention him at all. It is well documented, however, that [[Kublai Khan]] trusted foreigners more than Chinese/Han subjects in internal affairs<ref name="Giulio Busi 2018"/> and the discovery of the 1342 tomb of [[Katarina Vilioni]], member of an Italian trading family in Yangzhou, does, however, suggest the existence of an Italian community in the city in the 14th century. Moreover, both in ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' and in the ''[[History of Yuan]]'' there is documentation about a [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christian]] who funded two churches in China during the three years he served as an official of the emperor. This functionary is named "Mar Sarchis" by Marco Polo and "Ma Xuelijisi" in the ''History of Yuan''. This person served as a supervisor in the prefecture of [[Zhenjiang]].<ref name="Giulio Busi 2018">Giulio Busi, "Marco Polo. Viaggio ai confini del Medioevo", Collezione Le Scie.

During the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644) until the 19th century Yangzhou acted as a major trade exchange center for salt (a government regulated commodity), rice, and silk. The Ming were largely responsible for building the city as it now stands and surrounding it with {{Convert|9|km|abbr=on}} of walls, in part as protection against [[Wokou]] [[Jiajing wokou raids|raids]].

There was a Hui or Chinese Muslim community in Yangzhou during the Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasties with historic mosques like [[Crane Mosque]] and the tomb of [[Sayyid]] [[Puhaddin]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Puhading Yuan in Yangzhou - Attraction {{!}} Frommer's |url=https://www.frommers.com/destinations/yangzhou/attractions/puhading-yuan |access-date=2023-11-28 |website=www.frommers.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Xianhe Mosque in Yangzhou of Jiangsu, Muslim Mosque in Yangzhou |url=https://www.topchinatravel.com/china-attractions/xianhe-mosque.htm |access-date=2023-11-28 |website=www.topchinatravel.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Puhading Cemetery, Yangzhou |url=https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g494934-d1864987-Reviews-Puhading_Cemetery-Yangzhou_Jiangsu.html |access-date=2023-11-28 |website=Tripadvisor |language=en}}</ref>

[[File:Yangzhou massacre.jpg|thumb|A late Qing artist conception of the [[Yangzhou massacre]].]]
After the fall of Beijing and northern China to the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] in 1644, Yangzhou remained under the control of the short-lived [[Southern Ming]] based in [[Nanjing]]. [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] forces led by [[Dodo (prince)|Prince Dodo]] reached Yangzhou in the spring of 1645, and despite the heroic efforts of its chief defender, [[Shi Kefa]], the city fell on May 20, 1645, after a brief siege. The [[Yangzhou massacre]] followed; [[Wang Xiuchu]]'s contemporary account alleged that the number of victims was close to 800,000, but that number is certainly an exaggeration.{{sfnp|Finnane|2004|p=453}}<ref>{{lang|zh-Hans|谢国桢，《南明史略》，第72—73页}}{{full citation needed|date=May 2020}}</ref> Shi Kefa himself was killed by the Manchus when he refused to switch his allegiance to the Manchurian Qing regime.<ref>"Horrid beyond description": The massacre of Yangzhou", in ''Voices from the Ming-Qing Cataclysm: China in Tigers' Jaws'', ed.

The city's rapid recovery from these events and its great prosperity through the early and middle years of the Qing dynasty were due to its role as administrative center of the Lianghuai sector of the government salt monopoly. As early as 1655, the Dutch envoy [[Johan Nieuhof]] described the city of Yangzhoufu ({{lang|fr|Jamcefu}} in his transcription):<ref>[[Johan Nieuhof]],
''[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/DLDecArts/DLDecArts-idx?type=turn&entity=DLDecArts.Nieuhof.p0108 An embassy from the East-India Company of the United Provinces, to the Grand Tartar Cham, emperor of China: delivered by their excellencies Peter de Goyer and Jacob de Keyzer, at his imperial city of Peking wherein the cities, towns, villages, ports, rivers, &c. in their passages from Canton to Peking are ingeniously described by John Nieuhoff; ... Englished and set forth with their several sculptures by John Ogilby]'', 1673, p.82</ref>
{{blockquote|This Trade alone has so very much enrich'd the Inhabitants of this Town, that they have re-built their City since the last destruction by the ''[[Manchu people|Tartars]]'', erecting it in as great splendor as it was at first.}}

Famed at that time and since for literature, art, and the gardens of its merchant families, many of which were visited by the Kangxi and Qianlong emperors during their Southern Tours, the Qing-era Yangzhou has been the focus of intensive research by historians.

The [[Yangzhou riot]] in 1868 was a pivotal moment of [[China–United Kingdom relations|Anglo-Chinese relations]] during late Qing China that almost led to war.<ref>Austin (2007), p. 129</ref> The crisis was fomented by the [[scholar-official]]s of the city, who opposed the presence of foreign [[Mission (Christianity)|Christian missionaries]] there. The riot that resulted was an angry crowd estimated at eight to ten thousand who assaulted the premises of the British [[OMF International|China Inland Mission]] in Yangzhou by looting, burning and attacking the missionaries led by [[Hudson Taylor]]. No one was killed, however several of the missionaries were injured as they were forced to flee for their lives. As a result of the report of the riot, the British consul in [[Shanghai]], [[Walter Henry Medhurst (consul)|Sir Walter Henry Medhurst]] took seventy [[Royal Marines]] in a [[man-of-war]] and steamed up the Yangtze to Nanjing in a controversial show of force that eventually resulted in an official apology from [[Viceroy]] [[Zeng Guofan]] and financial restitution made to the injured missionaries.

===Modern China===
From the time of the [[Taiping Rebellion]] (1853) to the beginning of the Reform Era (1980) Yangzhou was in decline, due to war damage, neglect of the Grand Canal as railways replaced it in importance, and stagnation in the early decades of the PRC. During the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], it endured eight years of Japanese occupation and was used by the enemy as a site for internment camps. About 1200 civilians of Allied nationalities (mostly British and Australian) from Shanghai were transported here in 1943, and located in one of three camps (A, B, and C). Camps B and C were closed down in September, 1943, after the second American-Japanese prisoner exchange, and their inhabitants transferred back to Shanghai camps.  Camp C, located in the former American Mission in the north-west of the city, was maintained for the duration of the war.<ref>Leck, Greg, ''Captives of Empire: The Japanese Internment of Allied Civilians in China'' Shandy Press, 2006; Antonia Finnane, ''Far From Where? Jewish Journeys from Shanghai to Australia'' (Melbourne University Press, 1999), 106–7.</ref>

Among early plans for railways in the late Qing was one for a line that would connect Yangzhou to the north but this was jettisoned in favor of an alternative route. The city's status as a leading economic center in China was never to be restored. Not until the 1990s did it begin to regain some semblance of prosperity, benefitting from national economic growth and a number of targeted development projects.{{cn|date=October 2022}} With the canal now partially restored, and excellent rail and road connections, Yangzhou is once again an important transportation and market center. It also has some industrial output, chiefly in cotton and textiles. In 2004, a railway linked Yangzhou for the first time with Nanjing.{{cn|date=October 2022}}

==Geography==
[[File:Yangzhou five pavilion bridge.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Five Pavilion Bridge]] over the [[Slender West Lake]].]]
Yangzhou is located on a plain north of the Yangtze. The Grand Canal, also known as the [[Beijing|Jing]]-[[Hangzhou|Hang]] Canal, crosses the prefecture-level from the north to the south; its modern route passes through the eastern outskirts of Yangzhou's main urban area, while its old route runs through the city center. Other major bodies of water within the prefecture-level city include the [[Baoshe River]], [[Datong River]], [[Beichengzi River]], [[Tongyang Canal]], [[Xintongyang Canal]], [[Baima Lake]], [[Baoying Lake]], [[Gaoyou Lake]] and [[Shaobo Lake]].

Like much of the entire prefecture-level city, Yangzhou's main urban area (the "city proper") is criss-crossed by an intricate network of canals and small lakes. The historic city center (the former waled city) is surrounded by canals on all sides: the Old Grand Canal forms its eastern and southern boundaries; the City Moat Canal runs along the former walled city's northern edge, connecting the Old Grand Canal with the [[Slender West Lake]]; the Erdaohe Canal runs along the old city's western edge, from the Slender West Lake to the [[Hehuachi Park|Lotus Flower Pond]] (Hehuachi), which in its turn is connected by the short Erdaogou canal with the Old Grand Canal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://yangzhou.yztm.net/tnewsshow.asp?id=450 |script-title=zh:古运河—荷花池—瘦西湖水上游览线全部贯通] |website=yztm.net |date=2010-09-20 |access-date=2013-01-15 |archive-date=2015-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528224043/http://yangzhou.yztm.net/tnewsshow.asp?id=450 |url-status=dead }}</ref> It is possible to sail a small water craft from the Thin West Lake, via the Erdaohe, the Hehua Pond, and the Erdaogou into the Old Grand Canal.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.yzcn.net/broadcast/pic/2011/0329/124850.shtml |script-title=zh:绿杨城郭水上游4·18亮相 |website=yzcn.net |date=2011-03-29 |access-date=2013-01-15 |archive-date=2015-05-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528224019/http://www.yzcn.net/broadcast/pic/2011/0329/124850.shtml |url-status=dead }}; see the map in this article</ref>

The annual average precipitation is {{convert|1099.9|mm|abbr=on}}, and about 59.1% of rainfall is concentrated in the summer. The rainy season known as "plum rain season" usually lasts from mid-June to mid-July. During this season, the plums are ripening, hence the name plum rain. Extreme temperatures since 1951 has ranged from {{convert|-17.7|°C|0}} on 6 January 1955<ref>{{Cite web |last=网易 |date=2018-12-08 |title=这两天根本不算冷 看看全国各大城市历史极端最低温度是几度？ |url=https://www.163.com/dy/article/E2HHPSS305444WQP.html |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=www.163.com}}</ref> to {{convert|41.1|°C|0}} on 14 August 2022 during the [[2022 China heat wave|2022 China Heatwave]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=40.9°C 扬州气温再破历史记录 |url=https://news.jstv.com/a/20220816/f59e60e5fb604ce092274e3700436ecf.shtml |access-date=2024-09-15 |website=news.jstv.com}}</ref>

[[File:Yangzhou Railway Station - P1070063.JPG|thumb|300px|Yangzhou Railway Station]]
Yangzhou has one [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|Yangtze River crossing]], the [[Runyang Yangtze River Bridge|Runyang Yangtze River Bridge complex]], which has one of the [[List of longest suspension bridge spans|longest suspension bridge spans in the world]], and carries the [[G4011 Yangzhou–Liyang Expressway]] to [[Zhenjiang]].

===Air===
The [[Yangzhou Taizhou International Airport]], completed in 2012 to serve Yangzhou and neighboring [[Taizhou, Jiangsu|Taizhou]], is located in Jiangdu district.  The [[Nanjing Lukou International Airport]] is over {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} away; it takes one hour and 40 minutes to get there from central Yangzhou. Prior to the completion of the Yangzhou Taizhou Airport, Lukou Airport in Nanjing was the primary air gateway for passengers destined for Yangzhou. There are over 10 airline ticket offices in Yangzhou, providing convenient service for foreign and domestic tourists. domestic and international fight are available with 10 international airlines and more than 20 domestic ones

===Rail===
Until 2004, Yangzhou was not served by passenger rail. [[Yangzhou Railway Station]] began construction in 2003 and was completed a year later. It is located on the western outskirts of the city, and is a major station on the [[Nanjing–Qidong railway]], and provides direct passenger service to the provincial capital as well as a number of major cities to the west, north, and south (such as [[Xi'an]], [[Wuhan]], and [[Guangzhou]]), including an overnight [[Z-series trains|Z-series express train]] to [[Beijing]].<ref>[http://www.tielu.org/ tielu.org] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161205115111/http://www.tielu.org/ |date=2016-12-05 }}, schedule search for Yangzhou</ref> Later, frequent high-speed (D-series) service has been introduced on this line as well.

In 2020, the new [[Yangzhou East railway station|Yangzhoudong Railway Station]] came into service alongside with [[Lianyungang–Zhenjiang_high-speed_railway|Lianyungang-Zhenjiang High-Speed Railway]], an important high-speed railway running through the eastern part of the city that connects Southern and Northern Jiangsu with a design speed of 250kph. The railway connects Yangzhou to many major cities in the country using high-speed trains. The fastest direct train to [[Shanghai]] takes only 1 hour 19 minutes. 

A new railway with a design speed of 350kph, [[Shanghai-Nanjing-Hefei high-speed railway|Shanghai-Nanjing-Hefei High-Speed Railway]], is also under construction. It is expected to run through the major existing railway station, [[Yangzhou East railway station|Yangzhoudong Railway Station]].

=== River transport ===
Yangzhou harbor, {{convert|11.5|km|abbr=on}} south from the city center, is located at the junction of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Beijing–Hangzhou Canal]] and the [[Yangtze]] River. The average water depth is 15–20 meters. In 1992, the State Council approved it to become a first-grade open state harbor, and General Secretary [[Jiang Zemin]] inscribed its name. Now, it has developed into a comprehensive [[inland harbor]], integrating passenger, freight, container transportation and harbor trade, and has become the main distribution center of northern Jiangsu province, eastern [[Anhui]] Province and southeast [[Shandong]] Province. There are several dozen categories of goods including iron and steel, timber, minerals, coal, grain, cotton, container, products of light industry and machinery. The passenger routes reach Nanjing, Wuhu, [[Jiujiang]], [[Huangshi]] and [[Wuhan]] in the west, and [[Nantong]] and [[Shanghai]] in the east. Some well-known luxury international liners also anchor here. The harbor has greatly promoted the development of exports and the overall local economy.

===Expressways===

The Ningyang (Nanjing–Yangzhou) Expressway crosses the southern part of Yangzhou's metropolitan area while the Ningtong (Nanjing–Nantong) Expressway is connected to Yangzhou at Liaojiagou. In recent years, local government have attached great importance to the development of the tourism, in conjunction with a greater effort dedicated to the improvement of the local road transport system. With a total investment of 680 million yuan, the Yangzhou section of the Ningyang Expressway was completed on December 18, 1998, and opened to traffic in June 1999. Stretching nearly {{convert|18|km|abbr=on}}, the section of the expressway starts from the Bazi Flyover as the entry/exit, via the Yanggua Highway, the Tonggang Highway, an ancient canal, the Yangwei Highway, the Beijing–Hangzhou Grand Canal and the Yangling Highway, to Liqojiagou Entry/Exit of Yangjiang Highway. It then passes the Jiangdu Flyover to directly link up with the Huaijiang Expressway. In addition, the section of Huaijiang Expressway within the territory of Yangzhou began construction on March 22, 1997, which will be commonly used by the state planned Tongjiang–Sanya and Beijing–Shanghai trunk lines. The section of Huaijiang Expressway in Yangzhou totals {{convert|112.04|km|abbr=on}}in length, starting from Jinghe Town of Baoying in the north to the entry/exist of Zhuanqiaozhen Flyover of Jiangdu in the south. It then links with Ningtong Expressway, passing by three counties (cities) such as Baoying, Gaoyou and Jiangdu and 26 towns, at a total cost of 3.7 billion yuan. It is expected to be open to traffic by the year 2000.{{cn|date=October 2022}}
[[File:Yangzhou-Modern-Grand-Canal-barge-caravan-3342.JPG|thumb|The modern route of the [[Grand Canal (China)|Grand Canal]] passes within a few kilometers east of the city's main urban area.]]

===Intercity bus service===
During the daytime, frequent bus service operates between Yangzhou and nearby cities. There are several bus stations on the city's outskirts; most of the buses from [[Nanjing]] (Nanjing West Bus Station) and Zhenjiang (where the bus station is adjacent to the [[Zhenjiang Railway Station]]) arrive to Yangzhou South Bus Station, located a few kilometers southwest from downtown. Most of the intercity bus service stops in the early evening.

===Transportation in the urban area===
The city is served by an extensive network of public bus routes.

Yangzhou's taxi industry began in 1982, and has developed rapidly since 1993. the city has over 40 taxi companies of various ownership structures, with a total of 1,571 vehicles. Parking lots were established at key stations and hotels, and eight taxi companies have opened round-the-clock telephone service. The construction department of the municipal government has strengthened the management of taxi services, providing education in the relevant laws, professional ethics and safety aspects.

In 2014, Yangzhou's government approved plans for the construction of a subway system, which will initially include two lines. Line 1 will run in the general east–west direction, from Yangzhou Railway Station in the west to the historic central city to the future high-speed railway station (east of the Grand Canal) to [[Jiangdu District]]. Line 2 will run in the general north–south direction.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.yznews.com.cn/09zjyz/jr/2014-06/06/content_5228300.htm |script-title=zh:扬州地 1、2号线走向初定 |script-work=zh:扬州网 |date=2014-06-06}}</ref>

===Tourist transportation===

To develop tourism in Yangzhou, sightseeing buses have been introduced in the city run by the Tianma travel agency under the Yangzhou Tourist Bureau. There is a tour guide on each bus. The route, starting from Yangzhou station, has eight stops, and passes by such scenic spots of the [[Slender West Lake]], Daming Temple, Imperial Dock, Siwang Pagoda, Wenchang Pagoda, and Shita Temple.

[[File:Yangzhou-childrens-library-scooter-parking-3411.jpg|thumb|Children's Library building, on the premises of Yangzhou Public Library]]
The Yangzhou dialect ({{zh|c=扬州话|p=Yángzhōu huà|links=no}}) of Chinese is representative of [[Lower Yangtze Mandarin]], and is particularly close to the [[Mandarin (late imperial lingua franca)|official language]] of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] courts, which was based on the [[Nanjing dialect]]. However, it does differ considerably from modern [[Standard Chinese]], although they are still moderately [[mutually intelligible]].

Dialect has also been used as a tool for regional identity and politics in the [[Jiangbei region|Jiangbei]] and [[Jiangnan]] regions. While the city of Yangzhou was the center of trade, flourishing and prosperous, it was considered part of Jiangnan, which was known to be wealthy, even though Yangzhou was north of the Yangzi river. Once Yangzhou's wealth and prosperity were gone, it was then considered to be part of Jiangbei, the "backwater". After Yangzhou was removed from Jiangnan, its residents decided{{dubious|date=January 2016}} to replace [[Jianghuai Mandarin]], which was the dialect of Yangzhou, with [[Taihu Wu dialects]]. In Jiangnan itself, multiple subdialects of Wu fought for the position of prestige dialect.<ref>{{cite book

During a period of prosperity and imperial favor, the arts of storytelling and painting flourished in Yangzhou. The innovative painter-calligrapher [[Shitao]] lived in Yangzhou during the 1680s and again from 1697 until his death in 1707. A later group of painters from that time called the [[Eight Eccentrics of Yangzhou]] are famous throughout China.

Former General secretary of CPC, President of China [[Jiang Zemin]] was born and raised in Yangzhou. His middle school is located right across from the public notary's office in Yangzhou.

Yangzhou is famous for its carved [[lacquerware]] and [[jade]].

Some of China's most creative and eye catching dishes come from the Yangzhou school of cuisine called [[Huaiyang cuisine|Huaiyang]] (also commonly known as the Weiyang school). Along with [[Sichuan cuisine]], [[Cantonese cuisine]], and [[Shandong cuisine]], Huaiyang cuisine ({{lang|zh-hans|淮扬菜}}) is a distinctive and masterful skill that locals are quite proud of.

The city is famous for its [[public bath]] houses, [[lacquerware]], jadeware, embroidery, and paper-cut arts and crafts.

The city was awarded [[Habitat Scroll of Honor]] in 2006.

Yangzhou is also very famous for its toy industry (especially stuffed animals). Many tourists from neighboring cities travel to the city for its good-quality and low-priced toys.

It is worth mentioning that the city is also famous for an ancient folk art called Yangzhou storytelling ({{lang|zh-hans|扬州评话}}), which is like [[Xiangsheng]]—the traditional Chinese comedic performance. It rose as a performing act during the [[Ming dynasty]]. In the performance, the artist details an interesting historical story to audiences, using Yangzhou dialect. These stories have been edited by artists, so they sound very soul-stirring and funny. The best known artist of Yangzhou storytelling was [[Wang shaotang]]. His most famous works are The 10 chapters of [[Wu Song]] ({{lang|zh-hans|武十回}}), The 10 chapters of [[Song Jiang]] ({{lang|zh-hans|宋十回}}), The 10 chapters of [[Lu Junyi]] ({{lang|zh-hans|卢十回}}), and The 10 chapters of [[Shi Xiu]] ({{lang|zh-hans|石十回}}).<ref>Vibeke Børdahl, The Oral Tradition of Yangzhou Storytelling, London: Routledge, 1996; Vibeke Børdahl and Jette Ross, Chinese Storytellers: Life and Art in the Yangzhou Tradition, Cheng and Tsui 2002.</ref>

===Literary references===
Yangzhou was frequently referenced in Chinese literature.  Poet [[Li Bai]] (c. 700–762) wrote in ''Seeing Meng Haoran off to Yangzhou from Yellow Crane Pavilion'':

:At Yellow Crane Pavilion in the west
:My old friend says farewell;
:In the mist and flowers of spring
:He goes down to Yangzhou;
:Lonely sail, distant shadow,
:Vanish in blue emptiness;
:All I see is the great river
:Flowing into the far horizon.

[[Du Mu]] wrote the famous lines on Yangzhou:<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h8fWf7pYOIUC&pg=PA218 |title=How to Read Chinese Poetry: A Guided Anthology|author= Zong-qi Cai |page= Columbia University Press|date=30 November 2007 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=9780231511889 }}</ref>

:After ten years, I awoke from my Yangzhou dream,
:All I gained was a fickle reputation in the green mansions.

The "green mansions" or "green/black lofts" (''qinglou'') refers to the [[Red-light district|pleasure district]]s for which Yangzhou became known.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dvFJQ6WE1agC&pg=PA287|title=Lifestyle and Entertainment in Yangzhou|author1=Lucie B.

In the Qing dynasty novel [[Dream of the Red Chamber]], the character of [[Lin Daiyu]] is from Yangzhou.

==Tourism==

Tourist sights include [[Slender West Lake]] and old residences in the moated town, such as the Wang Residence and the Daming temple. Yangzhou is famous for its many well preserved Yangzhou style gardens.  Most of the Historic city is in the Guangling District.

===Slender West Lake===
{{main|Slender West Lake}}
Named after Hangzhou's famous [[West Lake]], this long, narrow stretch of water which meanders through Yangzhou's western limits is a well-known scenic spot. A long bank planted with weeping willows spans the lake. At its midpoint stands the [[Five-Pavilion Bridge]] with five covered terraces, one at each of the corners and one in the center. Around the lake is a park in which are found several attractions: [[Xu Garden (Yangzhou)|Xu Garden]], the [[White Dagoba (Yangzhou)|White Dagoba]] of [[Lianxing Temple]], copied from the similar tower in [[Beijing]]'s [[Beihai Park]]; Small Gold Mountain (Xiao Jinshan); and the Fishing Platform (Diaoyutai), a favorite retreat of the Qing emperor Qian Long. The emperor was so gratified by his luck in fishing at this spot that he ordered additional stipends for the town. As it turns out, his success had been augmented by local swimmers who lurked in the lake busily attaching fish to his hook.

===Daming Temple===
{{main|Daming Temple}}
Located on Shugang Hill, in the city's northwest, is Fajing Temple, formerly known as DaMing Temple. The original temple was built in Liu Song dynasty (420–479). A nine-story pagoda, the Qilingta, was built on the temple grounds in the year of Sui dynasty (589–618) . A recent addition to the temple complex is the [[Jianzhen]] Memorial Hall, built according to Tang dynasty methods and financed with contributions raised by Buddhist groups in Japan.
When Qing Emperor Qian Long visited Yangzhou in 1765, he was troubled by The temple's name DaMing (which literally means "Great Ming') fearing that it might revive nostalgia for the Ming dynasty, which was overthrown by his Manchu predecessors. He had it renamed Fajing Temple.
The temple was seriously damaged during the Taiping Rebellion at the beginning of the 20th century. The present structure is a reconstruction dating from the 1930s.

===Flat Hills (Ping Shan) Hall===
Built by the Song dynasty writer Ouyang Xiu when he served as prefect of the city, this hall stands just west of Fajing Temple. Looking out from this hall, the mountains to the south of the Yangtze River appear as a line at the viewer's eye level, hence the name Flat Hills Hall. When Ouyang Xiu's student Su Dongpo moved to Yangzhou, he too served as prefect of the city. He had a hall built directly behind the one erected by his master, and called it Guling Hall.

===Pavilion of Flourishing Culture===
[[File:Yangzhou-WenchangGe-traffic-3417.jpg|thumb|Wenchang Ge]]
The Pavilion of Flourishing Culture {{nowrap|(<small>[[traditional characters|t]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|文|昌|閣}}}},}} {{nowrap|<small>[[simplified characters|s]]</small> {{lang|zh|{{linktext|文|昌|阁}}}},}} ''Wénchāng Gé'') is a round, three-story pavilion in Yangzhou's eastern sector, built in 1585 and celebrating the city's rich cultural traditions. It is also the de facto center of the city.

Built during [[Ming dynasty]], it is located on the cross of Wenchang Road and Wenhe Road. The whole building is about 79-foot high, and looks like [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing. Today, bordered by many shopping stores, Wenchange had been a symbol of commercial center to residents.

===Stone Pagoda ===
The Stone Pagoda {{nowrap|({{lang|zh|{{linktext|石|塔}}}},}} ''Shítǎ'') is a five-story Tang-era pagoda west of the Pavilion of Flourishing Culture. First built in 837, it is the oldest pagoda still standing in Yangzhou.

===Tomb of Puhaddin===
[[File:Yangzhou-Minaret-3284.jpg|thumb|right|The mosque complex at the tomb of Puhaddin]]
{{main|Tomb of Puhaddin}}
This is essentially a Ming dynasty graveyard that includes the tomb of [[Puhaddin]]. According to information at the tomb, he was a 16th generation descendant of [[Muhammad]], the prophet. The tomb is on the eastern bank of the (Old) Grand Canal in the eastern sector of the city and is adjacent to a mosque which houses a collection of valuable materials documenting China's relations with Muslim countries.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/china/beijing-to-shanghai/review-434792.html|title=Garden Tomb of Puhaddin Beijing to Shanghai Review|website=fodors.com}}</ref>

===Ge Garden===
{{main|Geyuan}}
[[Ge Garden]] or Geyuan is a [[Jiangnan area|Jiangnan]] [[Traditional Chinese house architecture|estate]] and [[Chinese garden|garden]], reckoned among the most refined and beautiful in China. Erected off Dongguan Road over a previous estate, the present design was established and named by the prosperous [[salt in the Qing Empire|salt merchant]] [[Huang Zhiyun]],<!--not Si Tao or Wang Yingtai--> who named it in honor of the virtues of the [[bamboo]]<!--absolutely nothing to do with the character 個 or its meaning--> that appear in his name and throughout the garden.{{sfnp|Finnane|2004|p=209}} It is particularly famed for its four rockeries intended to represent the [[seasons (China)|seasons]].

===He Garden===
{{main|He Garden}}
[[He Garden]] or Heyuan, also known as the Jixiao Shanzhuang, was built by the 19th-century Qing [[scholar bureaucrat|official]] [[He Zhidao]]. The garden is famed for its winding {{convert|430|m|ft|abbr=on|sp=us}} 2 story corridor, the walls of which are lined with stone tablets carved with lines of classical poetry. The garden also has an open-air theater set on an island in the middle of a fish pond.

===Yechun Garden===
{{main|Yechun Garden}}
[[Yechun Garden]] or Yechunyuan lies on the banks of the Xiading River at the city's northern limits. Under the Qing, the poet Wang Yuyang and his circle of friends used to gather in the garden to recite their works. The thatched roofs of the pavilions in this garden give it a quaint rustic air.

===Yangzhou Museum===
[[File:Yangzhou-Double-Museum-2869.jpg|thumb|Yangzhou Museum / China Block Printing Museum]]
{{main|Yangzhou Museum}}
The [[Yangzhou Museum]] is on the west shore of Bright Moon Lake, its architecture intended to embody the harmony of man and nature. The museum proper{{mdash}}covering the history of Yangzhou and the surrounding areas of China{{mdash}}occupies only a portion of the third floor, the other floors technically organized and operated as separate museums including the Chinese Block Printing Museum ({{lang|zh-hans|扬州中国雕版印刷博物馆}}) established by the State Council in August 2003 to house 300,000 printing blocks collected by Yangzhou's Guangling Press. All together, the museums cover an area of {{convert|50,000|sqm|sp=us}} with the exhibition area occupying a fifth of the total.

===Jiangdu Hydro Project===
{{main|South–North Water Transfer Project}}
The [[Jiangdu Hydro Project]] is the southern beginning of the eastern route of the [[South–North Water Transfer Project]], intended to divert massive amounts of freshwater from the mouth of the Yangtze to China's drier northern regions along the route of the Grand Canal. Construction of the pumping facilities involved began in 1961 and was completed in 1975.{{cn|date=October 2022}} The project includes facilities for irrigation, drainage, navigation, and power generation including 4 large electric pumping stations, 6 medium-sized check gates, 3 navigation locks, and 2 trunk waterways.
