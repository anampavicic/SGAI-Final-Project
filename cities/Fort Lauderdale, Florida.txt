'''Fort Lauderdale''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|ɔː|d|ər|d|eɪ|l}} {{respell|LAW|dər|dayl}}) is a coastal city located in the U.S. state of [[Florida]], {{convert|30|mi}} north of [[Miami]] along the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. It is the [[county seat]] of and most populous city in [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]] with a population of 182,760 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]],<ref name="2020CensusPopulationByRace" /> making it the tenth-most populous city in Florida. After Miami and [[Hialeah, Florida|Hialeah]], Fort Lauderdale is the third-most populous city in the [[Miami metropolitan area]], which had a population of 6,166,488 in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web |date=March 6, 2020 |title=Revised Delineations of Metropolitan Statistical Areas, Micropolitan Statistical Areas, and Guidance on the Uses of the Delineations of These Areas |url=chrome-ehttps://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bulletin-20-01.pdf |access-date=January 3, 2020 |publisher=Executive Office of the President |page=59}}</ref>

Built in 1838 and first incorporated in 1911, Fort Lauderdale is named after a series of forts built by the United States during the [[Second Seminole War]].<ref>{{cite news |title=A look at Fort Lauderdale, from the 1880s to today |url=https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/sfl-fort-lauderdale-historical-photo-gallery-20170228-photogallery.html |access-date=February 14, 2022 |publisher=sun-sentinel.com}}</ref> The forts took their name from Major [[William Lauderdale]] (1782–1838), younger brother of Lieutenant Colonel [[James Lauderdale]]. Development of the city did not begin until 50 years after the forts were abandoned at the end of the conflict. Three forts named "Fort Lauderdale" were constructed including the first at the fork of the [[New River (Broward County, Florida)|New River]], the second at Tarpon Bend on the New River between the present-day Colee Hammock and [[Rio Vista (Fort Lauderdale)|Rio Vista]] neighborhoods, and the third near the site of the Bahia Mar Marina.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fort Lauderdale and the Second Seminole War |url=https://www.fortlauderdale.gov/Home/ShowDocument?id=2740 |publisher=City of Fort Lauderdale |access-date= February 14, 2022}}</ref>

The area in which the city of Fort Lauderdale would later be founded was inhabited for more than two thousand years by the [[Tequesta]] Indians.<ref name=Hughes>{{Cite news |url=http://fulltext.fcla.edu//DLData/SN/SN01480340/0016_003/file5.pdf |title=Three Tequesta and Seminole hunting camps on the edge of the Everglades |last=Hughes |first=Kenneth J |periodical=Broward Legacy (Broward County Historical Commission). |volume=16 |year=1993 |pages=31–42 |access-date=2007-07-01 |issue=3 and 4 }}</ref> Contact with Spanish explorers in the 16th century proved disastrous for the Tequesta, as the Europeans brought with them diseases, such as smallpox, to which the native populations possessed no resistance. For the Tequesta, disease, coupled with continuing conflict with their [[Calusa]] neighbors, contributed greatly to their decline over the next two centuries.<ref name=McGoun>{{Cite news |url=http://fulltext10.fcla.edu/DLData/SN/SN01480340/0002_003/file66.pdf |title=A History of Broward County |last=McGoun |first=Bill |periodical=Broward Legacy (Broward County Historical Commission) |year=1978 |volume=2 |pages=15–22 |access-date=2007-07-03|issue=3 and 4 }}</ref> By 1763, there were only a few Tequesta left in Florida, and most of them were evacuated to Cuba when the Spanish ceded Florida to the British in 1763, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]], which ended the [[Seven Years' War]].<ref name=Hughes /> Although control of the area changed between Spain, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the [[Confederate States of America]], it remained largely undeveloped until the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

The Fort Lauderdale area was known as the "New River Settlement" before the 20th century. In the 1830s, there were approximately 70 settlers living along the New River. [[William Cooley]], the local [[Justice of the Peace]], was a farmer and [[Wrecking (shipwreck)|wrecker]], who traded with the [[Seminole Indians]]. On January 6, 1836, while Cooley was leading an attempt to salvage a wrecked ship, a band of Seminoles attacked his farm, killing his wife and children, and the children's [[tutor]]. The other farms in the settlement were not attacked, but all the white residents in the area abandoned the settlement, fleeing first to the [[Cape Florida Light]]house on [[Key Biscayne]], and then to [[Key West, Florida|Key West]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.voneresearch.org/HistoryB.htm |title=Coastal History&nbsp;– The Seminole War Period |publisher=Vone Research |access-date=2007-07-21|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20070928014231/http://www.voneresearch.org/HistoryB.htm |archive-date = September 28, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The fort was abandoned in 1842, after the end of the war, and the area remained virtually unpopulated until the 1890s. It was not until Frank Stranahan arrived in the area in 1893 to operate a ferry across the New River, and the [[Florida East Coast Railroad]]'s completion of a route through the area in 1896, that any organized development began. The city was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] in 1911, and in 1915, was designated the county seat of newly formed [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]].<ref name=BrowardCreation>{{Cite news| url=http://fulltext.fcla.edu//DLData/SN/SN01480340/0011_003/file5.pdf |title=The Creation of Broward County: Victory in Tallahassee| periodical=Broward Legacy (Broward County Historical Commission) |year=1988 |volume=11 |pages=6–8 |access-date=2007-07-02 |issue=3 and 4}}</ref>

Until July 1961, only whites were allowed on Ft. Lauderdale beaches. There were no beaches for African-Americans in Broward County until 1954, when "the Colored Beach," today [[Dr. Von D.

After 1970, growth in the area shifted to suburbs to the west.

The northwestern section of Fort Lauderdale is separate from the remainder of the city, connected only by the Cypress Creek Canal as it flows under I-95. This section of Fort Lauderdale borders the cities of Tamarac and Oakland Park on its south side. Oakland Park also borders Fort Lauderdale on the west side of its northeastern portion. The greater portion of Fort Lauderdale in the south is bordered, along its north side by Wilton Manors.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Harrison |first1=Carlos |title=Wilton Manors: South Florida's Most Famous Gayborhood |url=https://www.visitflorida.com/en-us/travel-ideas/wilton-manors-gayborhood-in-south-florida.html |access-date=23 January 2021 |work=Visit Florida}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Discover Which Municipalities Are Bordering Fort Lauderdale |url=https://www.thesourcetreatmentcenter.com/blog/municipalities-bordering-fort-lauderdale-florida/ |website=The Source |access-date=23 January 2021 |date=1 May 2020}}</ref>

Off the coast of Fort Lauderdale is the [[Osborne Reef]], an [[artificial reef]] made of discarded tires that has proven to be an ecological disaster.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna17189132 | title=Tire reef off Florida proves a disaster | agency=Associated Press | date=February 16, 2007 | access-date=2007-06-21}}</ref> The dumping began in the 1960s, with the intent of providing habitat for fish, while disposing of trash from the land. However, in the rugged and corrosive environment of the ocean, nylon straps used to secure the tires wore out, cables rusted, and tires broke free. The tires posed a particular threat after breaking free from their restraints. The tires then migrated shoreward, and ran into a living reef tract, washed up on its slope, and killed many things in their path. In recent years, thousands of tires have also washed up on nearby beaches, especially during hurricanes. Local authorities are now working to remove the 700,000 tires, in cooperation with the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]], [[United States Navy|Navy]], and [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]].<ref name=reuters>{{cite news |last=Loney |first=Jim |date=July 9, 2007 |title=Florida raises ill-fated artificial reefs |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-reef-tires-feature-idUSN2943349920070709 |work=Reuters |access-date=2007-07-10}}</ref>

===Climate===
According to the [[Köppen climate classification]], Fort Lauderdale has a [[tropical rainforest climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Af''). While the city does not have a fully [[dry season]], much of the seasonal rainfall comes between May and October. Winters are frequently dry and sunny, and drought can be a concern in some years.

Fort Lauderdale is situated in USDA [[hardiness zone]]s 10b to 11a near the coast.

The wet season runs from May through October, and weather is typically hot, humid, and wet with average high temperatures of {{convert|86|-|90|F|C|0}} and lows of {{convert|73|-|78|F|C|0}}. During this period, more than half of summer days may bring brief afternoon or evening thunderstorms with lightning and bursts of intense rainfall. The record high temperature of {{convert|100|F|C|0}} was recorded on June 22, 2009, and August 4, 1944.

The dry season often arrives some time in November, and lasts through early to mid April. Seasonable weather is often warm, dry, and sunny. Average high temperatures of {{convert|75|–|83|F|C|0}} and lows of {{convert|60|–|70|F|C|0}} are typical in the dry season. On rare occasions, cool fronts may make it all the way south to Fort Lauderdale, and the city will see a day or two of highs in the 60s °F (16–21&nbsp;°C) and lows in the 40s °F (4–10&nbsp;°C). Rare frosts occur every few decades, and only once in recorded history have [[snow flurries]] been reported in the air, which occurred on January 19, 1977.<ref>Lardner Jr., George; Meyers, Robert. "[http://search.proquest.com/docview/146900778/ Miami Is Hit by First Recorded Snow: State of Emergency Is Eyed for Virginia Thousands Idled as Cold Closes Factories, Businesses]".

''"It also snowed in Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach, Fort Myers, and yes, even in the Bahamas."''</ref><ref>South Florida Sun-Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) January 19, 2007.</ref> During the dry season (winter), brush fires can be a concern in many years.

Annual average precipitation is {{convert|60.95|in|mm|sigfig=3}}, with most of it occurring during the wet season from May through October. However, rainfall occurs in all months, even during the drier months from November through April, such as during the [[2023 Fort Lauderdale floods|April 2023 flash flood]] where about two feet of rain fell in half a day. Fort Lauderdale has an average of 131 precipitation days annually. The [[Atlantic hurricane season|hurricane season]] is between June 1 and November 30, with major hurricanes most likely to affect the city or state in September and October.<ref name=major>{{cite web

Fort Lauderdale is the second-largest city in the [[Miami metropolitan area]] and the largest city in [[Broward County]], holding nearly a tenth of the county's population. It grew at a fast pace throughout the first seventy years of the twentieth century, with its population expanding from 91 in 1900 to 139,590 in 1970. After this, it experienced a period of slow growth. During the 1970s, the city's population only grew by 10.2% to 153,279 in 1980.

This began a period of stagnation for the city of Fort Lauderdale, even as the metro area and the county continued their population boom. In the 1980s, the population of the city shrank for the first time, and by the [[1990 United States census|1990 census]] the number of residents of Fort Lauderdale fell just below 150,000. The next decade saw a slight rebound, but by the time of the [[2000 United States census|2000 census]], the city's population was at 152,397, still below its first peak in 1980.

In the 21st century, the population grew significantly. By the [[2010 United States census|2010 census]], the city's population had reached 165,521 as its population grew by 8.6% over the previous decade. By the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]], the city's population had reached 182,760 as its population grew by 10.4% over the previous decade.

BCT provides for connections with the bus systems in other parts of the metropolitan area: [[Miami-Dade Transit|Metrobus]] in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County]], and [[Palm Tran]] in [[Palm Beach County, Florida|Palm Beach County]]. [[Tri-Rail]], a [[commuter rail]] system, connects south Florida's major cities and airports.

[[The Wave (streetcar)|The Wave]], a new {{convert|2.7|mi|adj=on}} electric streetcar system costing $125 million, was being planned for the downtown. Most of the construction funding would have come from federal ($62.5 million), state ($37 million), and city taxpayers ($10.5 million), with approximately $15 million from assessments on properties within the Downtown Development Authority. Broward County (BCT) had committed to operating the system for the first 10 years at an expected annual cost of $2 million, and had guaranteed funding to cover any shortfall in ridership revenues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wavestreetcar.com/home |title=The Wave homepage |publisher=The Wave |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160121081144/http://www.wavestreetcar.com/home |archive-date=2016-01-21 }}</ref>  The construction cost of $50 million per mile was considerably higher than other recently built streetcar projects, in part due to the challenges of building an electric transit system over the 3rd Avenue drawbridge.
