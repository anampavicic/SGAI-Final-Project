'''Lansing''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|l|æ|n|s|ɪ|ŋ}}) is the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] of the U.S. state of [[Michigan]] and the most populous city in [[Ingham County, Michigan|Ingham County]]. It is mostly in the county, although portions of the city extend west into [[Eaton County, Michigan|Eaton County]] and north into [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]]. The [[2020 United States census|2020 census]] placed the city's population at 112,644,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/census-2020-look-population-changes-your-michigan-community |title=Census 2020: Look up population changes in your Michigan community |publisher=bridgemi.com |access-date=August 16, 2021 |archive-date=August 16, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210816190357/https://www.bridgemi.com/michigan-government/census-2020-look-population-changes-your-michigan-community |url-status=live}}</ref> making it the [[List of municipalities in Michigan|sixth most populous city in Michigan]]. The population of its [[metropolitan statistical area]] ([[Lansing–East Lansing metropolitan area|MSA]]) was 541,297 at the 2020 census, the third largest in the state after metropolitan [[Detroit]] and [[Grand Rapids]]. It was named the new state capital of Michigan in 1847, ten years after Michigan became a state.

The [[Lansing-East Lansing Metropolitan Statistical Area|Lansing metropolitan area]], colloquially referred to as "Mid-Michigan", is an important center for educational, cultural, governmental, commercial, and industrial functions. Neighboring [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]] is home to [[Michigan State University]], a public research university with an enrollment of more than 50,000.<ref>{{cite web |title=MSU Facts |url=http://www.msu.edu/about/thisismsu/facts.html |publisher=Michigan State University |date=September 13, 2015 |access-date=January 14, 2016 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115030454/http://msu.edu/about/thisismsu/facts.html |archive-date=January 15, 2016}}</ref> The area features two [[medical school]]s, one veterinary school, two [[nursing school]]s, and two [[law school]]s.

==History==
===Exploration by Europeans===
The first recorded person of European descent to travel through the area that is now Lansing was British [[fur trader]] Hugh Heward and his [[French-Canadian]] team on April 24, 1790, while canoeing the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Woodruff |first1=Jim |date=September 1, 2015 |title=MGROW Takes On the Hugh Heward Challenge |url=http://mgrow.org/mgrow-hugh-heward-challenge/ |publisher=Middle Grand River Organization of Watersheds |access-date=February 7, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180820105734/http://mgrow.org/mgrow-hugh-heward-challenge/ |archive-date=August 20, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/archives/011226/health/index.html |title=John Hesse is our river guardian |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728032003/http://www.lansingcitypulse.com/lansing/archives/011226/health/index.html |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |first=Brian |last=McKenna |location=Lansing |work=City Pulse |date=December 19, 2001}}</ref> The land that was to become Lansing was surveyed as "Township 4 North Range 2 West" in February 1827 in what was then dense forest.

===Founding myth===
Historians have lamented the persistence of a myth about Lansing's founding.<ref name="peckham">{{cite web |last1=Peckham |first1=Linda R. |last2=Votta |first2=David |title=Daniel Buck's Biddle City: a myth about the founding of Lansing has persisted for more than 100 years. Begun by a well-meaning mayor, it evolved over the decades with each retelling—even making an appearance online, in a Wikipedia entry about the capital city. |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Daniel+Buck%27s+Biddle+City%3a+a+myth+about+the+founding+of+Lansing+has...-a0319975270 |via=The Free Library |work=Michigan History |access-date=April 4, 2023 |date=March 1, 2013 |archive-date=April 4, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230404044444/https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Daniel%20Buck%27s%20Biddle%20City%3A%20a%20myth%20about%20the%20founding%20of%20Lansing%20has...-a0319975270 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The incorrect story of Lansing's beginnings states that in the winter of 1835 and early 1836, two brothers from [[New York (state)|New York]] plotted the area now known as [[REO Town]] just south of [[downtown Lansing]] and named it "Biddle City". This land lay in a [[floodplain]] and was underwater during the majority of the year. Nevertheless, the brothers went back to [[Lansing, New York]], to sell plots for the town that did not exist. They told the New Yorkers this new "city" had an area of 65 blocks, a church and a public and academic square. 16 men bought plots in the nonexistent city, and upon reaching the area later that year found they were the victims of the scam. Many in the group, disappointed and now without funds to move on again, opted to stay and ended up settling around what is now metropolitan Lansing.

The story has persisted due to a 1904 newspaper article, which cited a memoir told by Daniel W. Buck, a respected Lansing mayor and son of one of the early pioneers. His story was cited in Michigan pioneer papers and retold in newspaper articles multiple times in the decades that followed. His characterization of the city as being born from a "land scam" was incorrect, though his story had some elements of truth as well.

===Origins as a town===
The brothers were William and Jerry Ford. Although they were originally from New York, they were well-respected businessmen who hailed from Jackson and were instrumental during its earliest years.

In 1836, they bought 290 acres in the northwest corner of Ingham County. They platted the land and hoped to build a community they named Biddle City, located south of the convergence of the Grand River and the Red Cedar River, in Lansing's present-day [[REO Town]] neighborhood. Biddle City's plat map included plans for a public square, church square and academy square. They sold 21 parcels of it — mostly to other Michiganders, not New Yorkers — and buyers understood that it was not yet a real city. Unfortunately, Biddle City never took off. The financial Panic of 1837 forced the brothers to heavily mortgage the property, and the city never materialized.<ref name="peckham"/>

Biddle City was not Lansing's original name, nor a precursor to it, as the plat was located outside of Lansing's original city limits.

Originally, all that existed was Lansing Township, named in 1842 by an early settler, Joseph E. North Sr., after Lansing in Tompkins County, NY, where he was from.

The settlement of fewer than 20 people that would become the City of Lansing remained quiet until the winter of 1847. The state constitution required the capital be moved from [[Detroit]] to a more central and safer location in the state's interior in 1847; many were concerned about Detroit's proximity to [[British Empire|British]]-controlled [[Canada]], which had captured Detroit in the [[War of 1812]]. The United States had recaptured the city in 1813, but these events led to the dire need to have the center of government relocated further away from hostile [[British America|British territory]]. There was also concern with Detroit's strong influence over Michigan politics, being the state's largest city as well as the capital city.<ref name="Yesterdays">{{cite book |title=Lansing and Its Yesterdays |publisher=State Journal Company |year=1930}}</ref>

During the multi-day session to determine a new location for the state capital, many cities, including [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], [[Marshall, Michigan|Marshall]], and [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]], lobbied hard to win this designation.<ref name="durant1880">{{cite book |first=Samuel W. |last=Durant |year=1880 |title=History of Ingham and Eaton Counties, Michigan |location=Philadelphia |publisher=D.W. Ensign |chapter=History of Lansing Township |pages=72–73 |url=http://www.migenweb.org/ingham/Lansing.html |access-date=April 11, 2021 |archive-date=April 11, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210411162432/http://www.migenweb.org/ingham/Lansing.html |url-status=dead}}</ref> Unable to publicly reach a consensus because of constant political wrangling, the [[Michigan State House of Representatives|Michigan House of Representatives]] privately chose the Township of Lansing out of frustration. When announced, many present openly laughed that such an insignificant settlement was now Michigan's capital. Two months later, Governor [[William L. Greenly]] signed into law the act of the legislature making [[Lansing Charter Township, Michigan|Lansing Township]] the state capital.<ref name="Yesterdays"/>

[[Image:Map of the town of Michigan 1847.jpg|thumb|An 1847 [[plat]] map of "the town of Michigan," prior to the selection of "Lansing" as the capital's name the following year. (The map is oriented with north to the right.)]]

With the announcement that Lansing Township had been made the capital, the small settlement quickly transformed into the seat of state government. Within months after it became the capital city, further individual settlements began to develop around it, along three key points along the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] in the township:<ref name="Yesterdays"/>

* "Lower Village/Town", where present-day Old Town stands, was the oldest of the three villages. It was home to the first house built in Lansing in 1843 by pioneer James Seymour and his family. Lower Town began to develop in 1847 with the completion of the Franklin Avenue (now [[Grand River Avenue]]) covered bridge over the Grand River.<ref name="city2008">{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoflansingmi.com/pnd/historypres/historydetails.jsp |title=Lansing History |access-date=October 29, 2008 |publisher=City of Lansing, Michigan |year=2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220220558/http://www.lansingmi.gov/pnd/historypres/historydetails.jsp |archive-date=December 20, 2012}}</ref>
* "Upper Village/Town", where present-day REO Town stands at the confluence of the Grand River and the [[Red Cedar River (Michigan)|Red Cedar River]]. It began to take off in 1847 when the Main Street Bridge was constructed over the Grand River. This village's focal point was the Benton House, a 4-story hotel, which opened in 1848. It was the first brick building in Lansing and was later razed in 1900.<ref name="city2008"/>
* [[File:LesCapitolSomethingMI.jpg|thumb|[[Michigan State Capitol]]]]"Middle Village/Town", where downtown Lansing now stands, was the last of the three villages to develop in 1848 with the completion of the Michigan Avenue bridge across the Grand River and the completion of the temporary capitol building which sat where Cooley Law School stands today on Capitol Avenue between Allegan and Washtenaw Streets, and finally the relocation of the post office to the village in 1851. This area would grow to become larger than the other two villages up and down river.<ref name="city2008"/>

The collection of original settlements ("Upper Town", "Lower Town" and "Middle Town") had for some years been collectively referred to as the "Village of Michigan".<ref>{{cite book |first=Birt |last=Darling |year=1950 |title=City in the Forest: The Story of Lansing |location=New York |publisher=Stratford House |chapter=Chapter 2. Ghost Towns – And a Live One |page=33}}</ref> On February 16, 1842, Alaiedon township was split into the townships of Lansing, Delhi and Meridian (originally suggested as "Genoa") based on a petition submitted in December 1841 by Henry North, Roswell Everett and Zalmon Holmes. Henry North proposed the name "Lansing" for the township at the request of his father, who wanted it named after their old town of [[Lansing, New York]].<ref name="durant1880"/>

On February 15, 1859, the settlement, having grown to nearly 3,000 and encompassing about {{convert|7|sqmi|km2|spell=in}} in area, was incorporated as a city, carving off a section of seven square miles from Lansing Township.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dozier |first1=Vickki |date=January 10, 2015 |title=From the Archives: Lansing mayors |url=https://www.lansingstatejournal.com/story/news/local/2015/01/10/archives-lansing-mayors/21557119/ |website=Lansing State Journal |access-date=July 25, 2022}}</ref> The boundaries of the original city were Douglas Avenue to the north, Wood and Regent streets to the east, Mount Hope Avenue to the south, and Jenison Avenue to the west. These boundaries would remain until 1916. Lansing began to grow steadily over the next two decades with the completion of the railroads through the city, a [[plank road]], and the completion of the current capitol building in 1878.

Most of what is known as Lansing today is the result of the city becoming an industrial powerhouse which began with the founding of [[Olds Motor Vehicle Company]] in August 1897. The company went through many changes, including a buyout, between its founding to 1905 when founder [[Ransom E. Olds]] started his new [[REO Motor Car Company]], which would last in Lansing for another 70 years. Olds would be joined by the less successful [[Clarkmobile]] around 1903.<ref>{{cite book |last=Clymer |first=Floyd |title=Treasury of Early American Automobiles, 1877–1925 |location=New York |publisher=Bonanza Books |year=1950 |page=25}}</ref> Over the next decades, the city would be transformed into a major American industrial center for the manufacturing of automobiles and [[list of auto parts|parts]], among other industries. The city also continued to grow in area. By 1956, the city had grown to {{convert|15|sqmi|km2|0}}, and doubled in size over the next decade to its current size of roughly {{convert|33|sqmi|km2|0}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cityoflansingmi.com/parks/forestry/history.jsp |title=Forestry Division – History |access-date=October 29, 2008 |publisher=City of Lansing, Michigan |year=2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006203248/http://www.cityoflansingmi.com/parks/forestry/history.jsp |archive-date=October 6, 2008}}</ref>

Today, the city's economy is diversified among government service, healthcare, manufacturing, insurance, banking, and education.

===Notable events===

====Anti-slavery movement====
In the late 1840s to early 1850s, the citizens of Lansing were unified against slavery, and the city became a secondary stop on the [[Underground Railroad]], as one of the last steps of an escape route that led through Battle Creek, Schoolcraft and Cassopolis. From Lansing, the route led to Durand, and then to either Port Huron or Detroit.<ref>{{cite book |first=Birt |last=Darling |year=1950 |title=City in the Forest: The Story of Lansing |location=New York |publisher=Stratford House |chapter=Chapter 3.

====Major fires====
The [[Kerns Hotel fire]] on December 11, 1934, was the deadliest in the city's history. Perhaps thirty-four people died in the fire, although the hotel register was also destroyed making an exact count impossible.

On February 8, 1951, the [[Elliott-Larsen Building]] was intentionally set on fire by a state office employee. The following morning, the seventh floor collapsed down to the next level, which destroyed a large number of state historical records.<ref>{{cite news |first=Bill |last=Castanier |title=Memories of Lansing's most devastating structural fire |location=Lansing, Michigan |work=City Pulse |url=https://www.lansingcitypulse.com/stories/memories-of-lansings-most-devastating-structural-fire,15571 |date=February 10, 2021 |access-date=April 11, 2021 |archive-date=April 30, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210430042821/https://www.lansingcitypulse.com/stories/memories-of-lansings-most-devastating-structural-fire,15571 |url-status=live}}</ref>

====Elephant incident====
On September 26, 1963, a 12-year-old, 3,000-pound female dancing elephant named [[Rajje (elephant)|Rajje]] (alternately reported as Raji and Little Rajjee, among other variations) rebelled against her trainer during a performance in a shopping-center circus near what was then Logan Street and Holmes Road in Lansing, and escaped into the streets, aggravated by the frenzied pursuit of nearly 4,000 local residents.

==Geography==
Lansing is the centerpiece of a region of Michigan known as [[Mid-Michigan]].

[[File:North Lansing dam.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The North Lansing dam of the Grand River. The [[Lansing River Trail]] and [[Ottawa Street Power Station]] are visible behind.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|36.68|sqmi|sqkm|2}}, of which {{convert|36.05|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is land and {{convert|0.63|sqmi|sqkm|2}} is water.<ref>{{cite web |title=US Gazetteer files 2010 |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |access-date=November 25, 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125061959/http://www.census.gov/geo/www/gazetteer/files/Gaz_places_national.txt |archive-date=January 25, 2012}}</ref> This figure includes two 425 Agreements with [[Alaiedon Township, Michigan|Alaiedon Township]] and Meridian Township, and the four 425 Agreements with Delta Township since 2000.

Since the 2010 census, the city has entered into two additional 425 Agreements. The first agreement consisted of the temporary transfer of 1,888.2 [[acres]] of Lansing Capital Region International Airport to the city from [[DeWitt Township, Michigan|DeWitt Township]] in 2011.<ref name=Transfer>{{cite web |title=Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS): Annexation Data |url=https://www.census.gov/geo/partnerships/bas/bas_annex.html |website=Census.gov |publisher=United States Census Bureau |access-date=December 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151220205107/http://www.census.gov/geo/partnerships/bas/bas_annex.html |archive-date=December 20, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The second agreement consisted of the temporary transfer of {{convert|41|acres|0|abbr=on}} in Alaiedon Township for the expansion of the headquarters of Jackson National Life Insurance Company in 2013 bringing the area either fully or conditionally under control of the city to {{convert|39.69|sqmi|sqkm|2}}.<ref name=Transfer/>

Under Michigan law, [[425 Agreement]]s are only temporary land sharing agreements and do not count as official annexations. The Census Bureau, however, for statistical purposes does count these as annexations. Not counting the temporary 425 Agreements, Lansing administers {{convert|34.1|sqmi|km2}} total.

Lansing is located in the south-central part of the [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan]], where the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] meets the [[Red Cedar River (Michigan)|Red Cedar River]]. The city occupies most of what had formerly been part of Lansing Charter Township. It has also annexed adjacent tracts of land in Delta Charter Township and [[Windsor Township, Michigan|Windsor Township]] in Eaton County to the west, [[Delhi Charter Township, Michigan|Delhi Charter Township]] in Ingham County to the south, and in [[DeWitt Charter Township, Michigan|DeWitt Charter Township]] in [[Clinton County, Michigan|Clinton County]] to the north. The city also controls three non-contiguous tracts of land through 425 Agreements (conditional land transfer agreements) with Meridian Charter Township, Delta Charter Township, and Alaiedon Township in Ingham County to the southeast. It is also located between the state's two largest cities, Detroit and Grand Rapids.

Lansing elevations range between {{convert|890|ft|m|0}} above [[sea level]] on the far south side of Lansing along Northrup Street near the Cedar Street intersection, to {{convert|833|ft|m|0}} to {{convert|805.5|ft|m|0}} above sea level along the Grand River.

The Grand River, the largest river in Michigan, flows through downtown Lansing, and the Red Cedar River, a tributary of the Grand, flows through the campus of Michigan State University to its confluence with the Grand in Lansing. [[Sycamore Creek (Michigan)|Sycamore Creek]], a tributary of the Red Cedar, flows northward through the southeastern part of the city.<ref>{{cite map |url=http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ |title=The National Map |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329155652/http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/viewer/ |archive-date=March 29, 2012 |access-date=September 23, 2015}}</ref> There are two lakes in the area, Park Lake and [[Lake Lansing]], both northeast of the city. Lake Lansing is approximately {{convert|500|acre|km2}} in size and is a summer favorite for swimmers, boaters, and fishermen. Michigan State University Sailing Club and the Lansing Sailing Club are located on Lake Lansing, where sailing regattas are hosted throughout the summer.

The City of Lansing operates a total of {{convert|3.55|sqmi|km2}} of parkland, of which {{convert|2.80|sqmi|km2}} is parkland, {{convert|0.43|sqmi|km2}} are golflands, and {{convert|0.31|sqmi|km2}} are cemetery lands.<ref>{{cite web |title=Park Facilities Inventory, Lansing Parks and Recreation Department |url=http://www.lansingmi.gov/media/view/2013_Park_Amenities_List_Updated/5803 |website=lansingmi.gov |publisher=Lansing Parks and Recreation Department |access-date=December 6, 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116161447/http://www.lansingmi.gov/media/view/2013_Park_Amenities_List_Updated/5803 |archive-date=January 16, 2016}}</ref> However, this figure includes the Waverly Hills [[Golf|Golf Course]] and adjacent Michigan Avenue Park, whose {{convert|0.18|sqmi|km2}} are located within neighboring Lansing Township, but operated by the City of Lansing, and does not include the {{convert|0.18|sqmi|km2}} of the combined Hawk Island County Park and adjacent Soldan Dog Park operated by Ingham County within the city of Lansing.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ingham County Parks |url=http://pk.ingham.org/Parks.aspx |website=Ingham.org |publisher=Ingham County |access-date=December 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151216003625/http://pk.ingham.org/Parks.aspx |archive-date=December 16, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> All together then, {{convert|3.55|sqmi|km2}} of the city (or approximately 10%) is publicly administered open space.

=== Neighborhoods ===
[[File:BojiTower.jpg|thumb|right|[[Boji Tower]], Lansing's tallest building, located downtown]]
The city's downtown is dominated by state government buildings, especially the State Capitol; but downtown has also experienced recent growth in new restaurants, retail stores and residential developments. Downtown Lansing had a historic city market that was one of the oldest continuously operating farmers' markets in the United States, until it closed in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fresh, Local, Unique |url=http://www.lansingcitymarket.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120130131/http://www.lansingcitymarket.com/ |archive-date=November 20, 2012 |access-date=October 24, 2012 |publisher=Lansing City Market}}</ref> Downriver and north of downtown is historic [[Old Town (Lansing, Michigan)|Old Town Lansing]] with many architecturally significant buildings dating to the mid-19th century.<ref>{{cite web |title=Home – Old Town Commercial Association |url=http://www.oldtownmainstreet.org/ |work=oldtownmainstreet.org |access-date=August 5, 2006 |archive-date=August 6, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060806143816/http://www.oldtownmainstreet.org/ |url-status=dead}}</ref> Directly south of downtown on the other side of [[Interstate 496|I-496]] along Washington Avenue lies "[[REO Town]]", the birthplace of the automobile in the United States, is where [[Ransom Eli Olds]] built factories along Washington Avenue. [[Ransom Eli Olds]]' home, which once overlooked the factories along Washington Avenue, was displaced by I-496.

Lansing is generally divided into four sections: the Eastside, Westside, Northwestside, and Southside. Each section contains a diverse array of neighborhoods. The Eastside, located east of the [[Grand River (Michigan)|Grand River]] and north of the Red Cedar River, is the most ethnically diverse side of Lansing, with foreign-born citizens making up more of its population than any other side in the city.<ref>{{cite web |title=Allen Neighborhood Center – Serving the Eastside of Lansing, MI |url=http://allenneighborhoodcenter.org/ |work=allenneighborhoodcenter.org |access-date=March 1, 2008 |archive-date=July 28, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728035530/http://allenneighborhoodcenter.org/ |url-status=live}}</ref> The Eastside's commercial districts are located mainly along Michigan Avenue, and to a lesser extent along Kalamazoo Street. It is anchored by Frandor [[Shopping mall|Shopping Center]] on the very eastern edge of the eastside.

The Westside, roughly located north, west, and south of the Grand River as it curves through the city, is sometimes regarded as the city's most socio-economically diverse section. This side also contains Lansing's downtown area, though this neighborhood is often included as an area all its own. Outside downtown, this side is largely a collection of residential neighborhoods and is served by only one other commercial area along Saginaw Street. However, it also includes a small part of the Old Town Commercial Association.

The Northwestside, generally located north of the Grand River, with the [[city limits]] defining its north and western borders, is physically the smallest side of the city. This part of the city includes moderate-density residential areas and some green areas. North of Grand River Avenue, the main street of the side, lie warehouses and light industrial areas served by a major rail line that runs through Lansing. The most notable landmark of this side is Lansing's airport: [[Capital Region International Airport]].

The Southside, usually described as the neighborhoods located south of the Grand and Red Cedar rivers and the I-496 freeway, is physically the largest and most populous side of the city. The area is largely residential in nature (south of Mount Hope Road near the northern edge) and is served by numerous commercial strips along Cedar Street, [[List of streets named after Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard]], Pennsylvania Avenue, and Waverly Road, which run north–south. The large Edgewood District is located in the southernmost part of the Southside and is sometimes referred to as South Lansing. Though it is the largest area of the city by both physical size and population, it has often been regarded by Southside citizens as Lansing's most overlooked and forgotten area, as most of Lansing's attention in recent decades has been put into the revitalization of the city's historic core located mostly on small parts of both the East and Westside.

The middle of the Southside—South-Central Lansing—contains the Old Everett Area. This location once contained the Everett School District and was annexed into the city in 1948.<ref>{{cite web |title=About Us – Old Everett Neighborhood Association |url=http://www.oldeverett.org/about-us |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130315113937/http://www.oldeverett.org/about-us |archive-date=March 15, 2013 |access-date=November 3, 2012 |work=oldeverett.org}}</ref>

Unincorporated areas adjacent to Lansing include parts of [[Lansing Charter Township, Michigan|Lansing Charter Township]], such as the unincorporated community of [[Edgemont Park, Michigan|Edgemont Park]], as well as parts of [[Delta Charter Township, Michigan|Delta Charter Township]], such as the unincorporated community of [[Waverly, Michigan|Waverly]]. Though they are not part of the City of Lansing, these unincorporated communities often use Lansing mailing addresses.<ref>{{google maps|title=|url=https://www.google.com/maps/@42.7331484,-84.5761245,12.84z|language=en}}</ref>

Also, the "Entertainment Express" (CATA route 4) runs Thursday through Saturday from 7 pm to 2 am connecting downtown Lansing's and East Lansing's entertainment districts. CATA won APTA's America's Best Transit Award in the medium-size category (4–30 million rides) in 2007. CATA has two transportation centers (CTC), one in downtown Lansing and one on the campus of Michigan State University. In 2010, a [http://www.cata.org/AboutCATA/NewsInfo/tabid/82/newsid948/76/mid/948/Does-CATA-study-point-to-Bus-Rapid-Transit-Light-Rail-or-Streetcar-/Default.aspx study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615054238/http://www.cata.org/AboutCATA/NewsInfo/tabid/82/newsid948/76/mid/948/Does-CATA-study-point-to-Bus-Rapid-Transit-Light-Rail-or-Streetcar-/Default.aspx |date=June 15, 2016 }} was conducted to consider ways of enhancing the Lansing-to-East Lansing route (currently known as Route 1), with options including enhanced bus service, single-car trolley service and light rail service. (Heavy rail was eliminated as an option early in the process, with enhanced bus service eventually winning out.)
* [[Greyhound Lines]] provides [[Intercity bus|inter-city]] [[bus]] service. CATA and Greyhound are both located in the CATA Transportation Center (CTC) in downtown Lansing.
* Several [[taxicab]] companies serve the area. In 2001, Big Daddy Taxi opened using large vans to address the safety concerns of drunk driving and offered $3 rides for students of Michigan State University. In 2008 the Green Cab Company opened using Toyota Prius hybrid cars to provide "green" cabs to Lansing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.capitalgainsmedia.com/devnews/cab0235.aspx |title=Southside Lansing Businessman Starts Green Taxi Cab Company |publisher=Capitalgainsmedia.com |date=September 10, 2008 |access-date=October 24, 2012 |archive-date=May 1, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501072448/http://www.capitalgainsmedia.com/devnews/cab0235.aspx/ |url-status=live}}</ref>
* The [[Michigan Flyer]] provides bus service between Lansing and [[Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport|Detroit Metro Airport]] 12 times daily, with a stop in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] along the way.

===Bicycling===
* The {{convert|13|mi|km|adj=on}}, non-motorized [[Lansing River Trail]] runs along the Grand River and the Red Cedar River, running as far east as Michigan State University, and passes Potter Park Zoo, the [[Capitol Loop]], and several other destinations of interest, and as far west as Moores Park. The trail is accessible at many points along it, some with car parking lots. The trails breadth is extended from time to time. Currently, the trailheads are:<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lansingrivertrail.org/Lansing-River-Trail-Map.pdf |title=Map |access-date=November 10, 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218123031/http://lansingrivertrail.org/Lansing-River-Trail-Map.pdf |archive-date=February 18, 2015}}</ref> North – Dietrich Park; East – Kircher Park; South – Maguire Park; West – Moores Park. All segments are hard-surfaced. The River Trail connects to other pathways/trails in the Lansing-metro area: East – Michigan State University path system; South – Sycamore Trail. Since the trail follows a river, most street crossings use platforms under existing street bridges to provide an uncommon amount of grade separation, to the benefit of both trail users and automobile traffic. As of February 2015, the River Trail is under construction to add paths as far as Holt.

==Utilities==
Water supply, power and steam are municipally owned utilities which are provided by [[Lansing Board of Water & Light]].

Lansing was a sister city of [[Kubyashi District]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Russia. The agreement began in 1992 and ended in practice when a change to the political structure of Saint Petersburg cancelled the district. The relations were officially severed by Lansing in 2013 as a protest of the laws against [[LGBT rights in Russia]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Howell |first=Brandon |title=Lansing Regional Sister Cities Commission: There are no ties with St. Petersburg, Russia to sever |url=http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2013/08/lansing_regional_sister_cities.html |access-date=August 14, 2013 |newspaper=MLive |date=August 14, 2013 |archive-date=August 18, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818200526/http://www.mlive.com/lansing-news/index.ssf/2013/08/lansing_regional_sister_cities.html |url-status=live}}</ref>
