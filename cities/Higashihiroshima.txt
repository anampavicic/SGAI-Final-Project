==History==
The area of Higashihiroshima is mostly part of ancient [[Aki Province]]. Archaeologists have found evidence of continuous human settlement from the [[Japanese Paleolithic]] period, with the oldest remains of several dwellings dating back to 22,000 years ago. Traces from the [[Yayoi period]] through the [[Kofun period]] are numerous, including the [[Mitsushiro Kofun]], a [[Monuments of Japan|National Historic Site]]. During the [[Nara period]], the ancient [[Sanyōdō]] highway connecting the [[Kinai region]] with [[Kyushu]] passed close to the north side of [[Saijō Station]]. [[Aki Kokubun-ji]] was located in what is now Higashihiroshima, and through geographic names, the original ''[[kokufu]]'' of the province was located in the vicinity before it  was relocated to [[Fuchū, Hiroshima (town)|Fuchū]] in the [[Heian period]]. During the [[Muromachi period]], the area was dominated by the [[Ouchi clan]], who built [[Kagamiyama Castle]], the ruins of which are a National Historic Site. The Ouchi were replaced after 200 years by the [[Mōri clan]] in the [[Sengoku period]]. After the establishment of the [[Tokugawa Shogunate]], the area was part of the holdings of [[Fukushima Masanori]] and later the [[Asano clan]] of [[Hiroshima Domain]].

===Municipal mergers===
* On April 1, 1889 - The town of [[Saijō, Hiroshima (Kamo)| Saijō]] was established with the creation of the modern municipalities system.
