==History==

===Mythology===
[[File:Map of Vedic India.png|thumb|right|Kaithal was known as '''Kapisthala''' during the [[Vedic period]] as seen in the map of the [[Indian subcontinent]].]]
Historically the city was known as '''Kapisthal''', meaning "Abode of ''Kapi''", another name of Lord [[Hanuman]], and it is said to have been founded by the [[Pandava]] Emperor, [[Yudhishthira]] of [[Mahabharata]]. The later word Kaithal is said to be derived from Kapisthala. It is traditionally connected with [[Hanuman]] and has a temple dedicated to [[Añjanā|Anjani]], the mother of Hanuman. It is also said that it is the birthplace of Lord Hanuman and there is a temple constructed at that place known as "Anjani Tila" among the residents of Kaithal.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sajnani |first1=Manohar |title=Encyclopaedia of tourism resources in India |year=2001 |publisher=Gyan Publishing House |isbn=8178350173 |pages=88, 89}}</ref>

The Vridhakedara (Vidkyar) sanctum of Kaithal finds a mention in the [[Vamana Purana]].<ref name ="nic">{{cite web|url=http://kaithal.gov.in/|title=NIC-Kaithal|website=kaithal.gov.in}}</ref> Kaithal, with many of its temples, is also an important milestone in the [[48 kos parikrama of Kurukshetra|48 Kos Parikrama]] pilgrimage.

===Early and medieval history===
[[Timur]] stopped here in 1398, before attacking Delhi. Later, the city became a [[Muslim]] cultural centre, under the rule of [[Delhi Sultanate]]. Tombs of several [[Sufi]] saints dating from the 13th century can be found in the city today; most important among them is that of Sheikh Salah-ud-din of Bhalkh (1246 CE). The town was renovated and a fort was built during the rule of the [[Mughal Emperor]], [[Akbar]], and as per [[Ain-i-Akbari]], it was a ''[[pargana]]'', under the ''sarkar'' of [[Sirhind]], and had developed into an agricultural centre.<ref>[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D00702052%26ct%3D196 Sarkar of Sirhind - Kethal (Kaithal)] [[Ain-i-Akbari]].</ref>

[[Razia Sultana|Razia Sulta]], the first woman ruler of India, reigned as the Sultana of [[Delhi Sultanate]] from 1236 to 1240. She fled Delhi with Malik Altúniya after they were defeated on the 24th of Rabí'u-l awwal A.H. 638 (Oct. 1240), and reached Kaithal the next day, where their remaining forces abandoned them, and were killed on 13 November 1240.<ref name="official-1">[http://kaithal.nic.in/history.htm] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416175757/http://kaithal.nic.in/history.htm|date=16 April 2015}} Introduction</ref><ref>[http://persian.packhum.org/persian/main?url=pf%3Ffile%3D80201012%26ct%3D83%26rqs%3D78 Razia Sultan] [[The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians.

Timur took the town in 1398, with his army massacring or plundering the inhabitants and destroying all villages along the way to [[Assandh]]. Many of the residents of Kaithal and the other cities had fled to Delhi in fear.<ref>{{cite book |last=Phadke |first=H.

===Modern history===
In 1767, the city fell into the hands of the [[Singh Krora Misl]] chieftain, Bhai Desu Singh (d. 1781), who led a large [[Sikh]] force from his native village of Bhucho, establishing the [[Kaithal State]]. In the Punjab whose descendants, the bhais of Kaithal, ranked among the most powerful [[Cis-Sutlej states]]. The Sikh Chieftains of Kaithal, ruled from 1767 until its fall in 1843. By 1808, it came under British influence. The state was ruled by the [[Scindhias|Scindhia dynasty]] of the [[Maratha Empire]] and paid tributes to the Marathas, until the [[Second Anglo-Maratha War]] of 1803–1805, after which the Marathas lost this territory to the British.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxhAtCflwOMC&q=daulatrao+scindia+punjab&pg=PA334 |title=A Comprehensive History of Medieval India: From Twelfth to the Mid ... - Farooqui Salma Ahmed, Salma Ahmed Farooqui - Google Books |access-date=26 May 2012|isbn=9788131732021 |last1=Ahmed |first1=Farooqui Salma |year=2011 |publisher=Pearson Education India }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D_v3Y7hns8QC&q=mahadji+sindhia+punjab&pg=PA13 |title=History Of The Marathas - R.S.

:This Gurudwara is dedicated to the Ninth Guru, [[Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji]]. He stopped here on his way from [[Anandpur Sahib]] to Delhi. Guruji stayed at the site of Gurudwara Manji Sahib. Early in the morning, Guruji came to this place. After taking a bath at the Thandar Tirth (also referred to as the Dandhar Tirth), Guru sat in meditation under a neem tree at this place. A large congregation of people who had heard of the Guru's arrival gathered there. One amongst them suffered from high fever. Guruji gave him the leaves of the neem tree and he was cured. This place then came to be known as Neem Sahib. All gurpurabs are celebrated here. Langar is organised every month on Sangrand (the first day of the month in the lunar calendar). A local committee appointed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Prabhandhak Committee looks after the management of the Gurudwara.<ref name="historicalgurudwaras.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.historicalgurudwaras.com/India/Haryana/Kaithal/Kaithal.php|title=Historical Gurudwaras In Kaithal|website=www.historicalgurudwaras.com}}</ref>

* '''Gurudwara Topiyon Wala''' - Situated in the middle of the city, this is the only Gurudwara/Temple where [[Guru Granth Sahib]] and [[Ramayan]] are recited together—a unique combination of Sikhism & Hinduism.
* '''Gurudwara Manji Sahib''' - Gurdwara Manji Sahib is situated in Sethan Mohalla, near Hind Cinema. It is near the Gita Bhavan.

:This Gurudwara is dedicated to the Ninth Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur. Guru Tegh Bahadur, after emancipating the sangat of the Malwa region, arrived here from Baher. The Guru told a carpenter from Bahir, named Malla, that he wanted to go to Kaithal and asked if there was any Sikh devotee there. Malla replied that there were two houses belonging to Banias and one to a Sikh there. On reaching Kaithal, Malla asked Guru whose house he would like to go to first. Guru replied the one that is nearest. Malla took Guru to the house of a fellow carpenter, also named Malla, who served the Guru with great devotion. Pleased with his devotion, the Guru told him to light a lamp for 40 days in honour of the Guru's darbar and he would be blessed with a son. The carpenter had a son in due course and he donated this place to the Gurudwara. At the request of the banias, Guru visited their house for lunch. He blessed the spot by saying that kirtan (singing of devotional songs) would be the norm here. This is the site of the Gurudwaras Manji Sahib. Guru spent three days preaching the tenets of Sikhism here and then left for village Barne.

*'''Tomb of Sheikh Tayyab''': The 16th-century tomb is situated in Kaithal city near Railway line. The words 'Sheikh' and Tayyab' stand for terms 'Fakir' (saint) and 'pure' Sufi saint Shah Kamal came to Kaithal from Bagdad. Sheikh Tayyab was a disciple and khalifa of Baba Shah Kamal. Sheikh Tayyab died sometime in the late 16th century AD. It is said that this tomb was constructed by Shah Sikandar, [[File:Shah Sikandar Mazar.JPG|thumb|Mazar of Shah Sikandar Qadri Kaithaly]] the grandson of Shah Kamal. The tomb is built on a square plan, a popular style of Pathan architecture. The roof is surmounted by a bulbous dome and a lotus flower finial rests on an octagonal drum-base.

Sheikh Tayyab's actual name was Lala Maidni Mal and he was one of the advisors to Mughal Emperor Akbar. He converted to Islam at the hands of Shah Kamal Qadri. His descendants from his Hindu wife are called "Qanugo" and the place where they used to live is called Mohalla "Qanugoyan" in Kaithal. There was a tradition when someone from Qanugo used to get married, they used to send one pitcher of sweet drink ([[Sherbet (powder)|sherbet]]) to Sheikh Tayyab masjid (also known as masjid of mirrors) and one pitcher to Shah Kamal shrine.

* '''Tomb of Shah Kamal Qadri and Shah Sikander Qadri''' (Baba Shah Kamal Lal Dayal):  known as Peer Baba to visitors, situated near Gol Market. Shah Kamal Qadri's shrine is well known in sub-continent for the past 450 years. He came from Baghdad in the time of Mughal emperor Akbar.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shah-kamal.com|title=Hazrat Shah Kamal Qadri Kaithaly|website=www.shah-kamal.com}}</ref>
There was a famine in the times of Shah Kamal. When he learned of it, he asked to prepare two big pots of special food (Dalya). One was prepared by a Muslim and the other one was prepared by a Hindu Brahman. It was announced that people from all over the city can come to eat day and night and take away this Dalya to their homes as well. There was a miracle that despite thousands of people eating from this langar, big pots were still filled with food. When famine ended, this food was discontinued.

After that incident, it was a tradition that every year in the month of "sawan" rainy season, on all four Thursdays of rainy season, people of every religion prepared this special food "dalya" and sent it to the Dargah of Baba Shah Kamal to be distributed among the needy.
