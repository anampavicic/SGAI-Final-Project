==Etymology and names==
{{further|Names of Jerusalem}}

===Etymology===
The name "Jerusalem" is variously etymologized to mean "foundation (Semitic ''yry''' 'to found, to lay a cornerstone') of the pagan god [[Shalim|Shalem]]";<ref>Meir Ben-Dov, ''Historical Atlas of Jerusalem'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 2002, p. 23.</ref><ref name=Binz>{{cite book |title=Jerusalem, the Holy City |last=Binz |first=Stephen J. |year=2005 |publisher=Twenty-Third Publications |location=Connecticut |isbn=978-1-58595-365-3 |page=2 |url={{Google books |id=7zLuDlzdTFYC |page=1 |plainurl=yes}} |access-date=17 December 2011}}</ref> the god Shalem was thus the original [[tutelary deity]] of the Bronze Age city.<ref>G.

Shalim or Shalem was the name of the god of dusk in the [[Canaanite religion]], whose name is based on the same root [[S-L-M]] from which the Hebrew word for "peace" is derived (''Shalom'' in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], cognate with [[Modern Standard Arabic|Arabic]] ''Salam'').<ref>{{cite book |title=Jerusalem |last=Elon |first=Amos |url=http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/tucker/hh362/TelAvivandJerusalem.HTM |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030310223636/http://www.usna.edu/Users/history/tucker/hh362/TelAvivandJerusalem.HTM |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 March 2003 |isbn=978-0-00-637531-9 |access-date=26 April 2007 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers Ltd |quote=The epithet may have originated in the ancient name of Jerusalem–Salem (after the pagan deity of the city), which is etymologically connected in the Semitic languages with the words for peace (shalom in Hebrew, salam in Arabic). |year=1996}}</ref><ref>Ringgren, H., ''Die Religionen des Alten Orients'' (Göttingen, 1979), 212.</ref> The name thus offered itself to etymologizations such as "The City of Peace",<ref name=Binz/><ref name=Hastings>{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of the Bible: Volume II: (Part II: I – Kinsman), Volume 2 |last=Hastings |first=James |author-link=James Hastings |year=2004 |publisher=Reprinted from 1898 edition by University Press of the Pacific |location=Honolulu, Hawaii |isbn=978-1-4102-1725-7 |page=584 |url={{Google books |id=0wvtFPz03GsC |page=584 |plainurl=yes}} |access-date=17 December 2011}}</ref> "Abode of Peace",<ref name=Bosworth>{{cite book |title=Historic cities of the Islamic world |last=Bosworth |first=Clifford Edmund |author-link=Clifford Edmund Bosworth |year=2007 |publisher=Koninklijke Brill NV |location=The Netherlands |isbn=978-90-04-15388-2 |pages=225–226 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&pg=PA226 |access-date=17 December 2011 |archive-date=18 February 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230218083731/https://books.google.com/books?id=UB4uSVt3ulUC&pg=PA226 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=DeGarmo>{{cite web |url=http://centre4conflictstudies.org/wanderingthoughts/category/denise-degarmo/ |title=Abode of Peace? |author=Denise DeGarmo |date=9 September 2011 |work=Wandering Thoughts |publisher=Center for Conflict Studies |access-date=17 December 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426042313/http://centre4conflictstudies.org/wanderingthoughts/category/denise-degarmo/ |archive-date=26 April 2012}}</ref> "Dwelling of Peace" ("founded in safety"),<ref>Marten H.

===Hebrew Bible and Jewish sources===
The form ''Yerushalem'' or ''Yerushalayim'' first appears in the Bible, in the [[Book of Joshua]]. According to a [[Midrash]], the name is a combination of two names united by God, ''Yireh'' ("the abiding place", the name given by [[Abraham]] to the place where [[Binding of Isaac|he planned to sacrifice his son]]) and ''[[Salem (Bible)|Shalem]]'' ("Place of Peace", the name given by high priest [[Shem]]).<ref>Ginzberg, Louis (1909).

===Greek, Roman and Byzantine names===
In Greek and Latin, the city's name was transliterated ''Hierosolyma/Hierosoluma'' (Greek: Ἱεροσόλυμα; in Greek ''hieròs'', ''ἱερός'', means holy), and was the term used by [[Matthew the Apostle|Matthew]] and [[Mark the Evangelist|Mark]] in their [[Gospel|gospels]] instead of the Hebrew term.<ref name="Hierosolyma">{{cite journal |last1=Brenk |first1=Frederick E. |title="Hierosolyma".

Up until the 2010's the consensus among [[historian]]s was that following [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquest, Hierosoluma was set to be incorporated into the larger temple cities of the [[Seleucid kingdom]], and to be [[Hellenized]] as ''Hierapolis.''<ref name="Hierosolyma"/> However, modern historians dispute this as a proper Ancient Greek translation for the [[polis]] would be similar to ''Hierolophos''.<ref name="Hierosolyma"/>

The city was renamed [[Aelia Capitolina]] for part of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] period of its history.{{cn|date=November 2024}}

==History==
{{Main|History of Jerusalem}}
{{For timeline}}
{{See also|Cartography of Jerusalem|l1=Historical maps of Jerusalem}}
Jerusalem is one of the world's oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years. Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the [[Gihon Spring]]. The city is first mentioned in Egyptian [[Execration texts]] around 2000 BCE as "Rusalimum." By the 17th century BCE, Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under [[Canaan]]ite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system. During the [[Late Bronze Age]], Jerusalem became a vassal of [[Ancient Egypt]], as documented in the [[Amarna letters]].

The city's importance grew during the ''Israelite period'', which began around 1000 BCE when [[King David]] captured Jerusalem and made it the capital of the [[United Kingdom of Israel]]. David's son, [[Solomon]], built the [[First Temple]], establishing the city as a major religious center. Following the kingdom's split, Jerusalem became the capital of the [[Kingdom of Judah]] until it was captured by the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]] in 586 BCE. The [[Babylonians]] destroyed the First Temple, leading to the [[Babylonian exile]] of the Jewish population. After the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE, [[Cyrus the Great]] allowed the Jews to return and rebuild the city and its temple, marking the start of the ''Second Temple period''. Jerusalem fell under [[Hellenistic]] rule after the conquests of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332 BCE, leading to increasing cultural and political influence from [[Greece]]. The [[Hasmonean]] revolt in 164 BCE briefly restored Jewish autonomy, with Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state.

In 63 BCE, Jerusalem was conquered by [[Pompey]] and became part of the [[Roman Empire]]. The city remained under Roman control until the [[Jewish-Roman Wars]], which culminated in the destruction of the [[Second Temple]] in 70 CE. The city was renamed ''Aelia Capitolina'' and rebuilt as a Roman colony after the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] (132–136 CE), with Jews banned from entering the city. Jerusalem gained significance during the [[Byzantine Empire]] as a center of [[Christianity]], particularly after [[Constantine the Great]] endorsed the construction of the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]]. In 638 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], and under early [[Islamic]] rule, the [[Dome of the Rock]] and [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] were built, solidifying its religious importance in Islam.

During the [[Crusades]], Jerusalem changed hands multiple times, being captured by the Crusaders in 1099 and recaptured by [[Saladin]] in 1187. It remained under [[Islamic]] control through the [[Ayyubid]] and [[Mamluk]] periods, until it became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1517. In the modern period, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan after the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]]. Israel captured [[East Jerusalem]] during the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, uniting the city under Israeli control. The [[status of Jerusalem]] remains a highly contentious issue, with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming it as their capital. Historiographically, the city's history is often interpreted through the lens of competing national narratives. [[Israelis|Israeli]] scholars emphasize the ancient Jewish connection to the city, while [[Palestinian]] narratives highlight the city's broader historical and multicultural significance. Both perspectives influence contemporary discussions of Jerusalem's status and future.

From 1949 until 1967, West Jerusalem served as Israel's capital, but was not recognized as such internationally because [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194|UN General Assembly Resolution 194]] envisaged Jerusalem as an [[international city]]. As a result of the Six-Day War in 1967, the whole of Jerusalem [[Reunification of Jerusalem|came under Israeli control]]. On 27 June 1967, the government of [[Levi Eshkol]] extended Israeli law and jurisdiction to East Jerusalem, but agreed that administration of the Temple Mount compound would be maintained by the [[Jerusalem Islamic Waqf|Jordanian waqf]], under the Jordanian Ministry of Religious Endowments.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jcpa.org/jcprg10.htm |title=Jerusalem in International Diplomacy |author=Dore Gold |access-date=20 July 2008 |author-link=Dore Gold |archive-date=28 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028044557/http://www.jcpa.org/jcprg10.htm |url-status=live}}</ref>

===International status===
While the international community regards East Jerusalem, including the entire Old City, as part of the [[occupied Palestinian territories]], neither part, West or East Jerusalem, is recognized as part of the territory of Israel or the [[State of Palestine]].<ref>[https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/the-controversial-sovereignty-over-the-city-of-jerusalem The Controversial Sovereignty over the City of Jerusalem (22 June 2015, The National Catholic Reporter)] {{Webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121191334/https://berkleycenter.georgetown.edu/essays/the-controversial-sovereignty-over-the-city-of-jerusalem |date=21 November 2018 }} "No U.S. president has ever officially acknowledged Israeli sovereignty over any part of Jerusalem (...)

[[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]] (20 August 1980; 14–0, U.S. abstaining) declared the Jerusalem Law "null and void" and called on member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem (see {{Harvard citation no brackets|Kellerman|1993|p=140}}). See [[Status of Jerusalem]] for more information.</ref> Under the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]] adopted by the [[General Assembly of the United Nations]] in 1947, Jerusalem was envisaged to become a [[corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|corpus separatum]] administered by the United Nations. In the war of 1948, the western part of the city was occupied by forces of the nascent state of Israel, while the eastern part was occupied by Jordan. The international community largely considers the legal status of Jerusalem to derive from the partition plan, and correspondingly refuses to recognize Israeli sovereignty over the city.<ref>"UN General Assembly Resolution 181 recommended the creation of an international zonea, or&nbsp;corpus separatum, in Jerusalem to be administered by the UN for a 10-year period, after which there would be referendum to determine its future.&nbsp;This approach applies equally to West and East Jerusalem and is not affected by the occupation of East jerusalem in 1967.&nbsp;To a large extent it is this approach that still guides the diplomatic behaviour of states and thus has greater force in international law" (Susan M. Akram, Michael Dumper, Michael Lynk, Iain Scobbie (eds.),&nbsp;International Law and the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict: A Rights-Based Approach to Middle East Peace,&nbsp;Routledge, 2010 p.119. )</ref>

===Status under Israeli rule===
Following the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel extended its jurisdiction and administration over East Jerusalem, establishing new municipal borders.
[[File:KnessetBuildingNov152022.jpg|thumb|The [[Knesset]] houses the [[legislature]] of Israel]]
In 2010, Israel approved legislation giving Jerusalem the highest national priority status in Israel. The law prioritized construction throughout the city, and offered grants and tax benefits to residents to make housing, infrastructure, education, employment, business, tourism, and cultural events more affordable. Communications Minister [[Moshe Kahlon]] said that the bill sent "a clear, unequivocal political message that Jerusalem will not be divided", and that "all those within the Palestinian and international community who expect the current Israeli government to accept any demands regarding Israel's sovereignty over its capital are mistaken and misleading".<ref>{{cite web |author=Tzippe Barrow |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2010/October/Bill-to-Grant-Jerusalem-Priority-Status/ |title=Bill to Grant Jerusalem Priority Status – Inside Israel – CBN News – Christian News 24–7 |publisher=CBN.com |date=25 October 2010 |access-date=28 February 2014 |archive-date=4 September 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140904135513/http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2010/October/Bill-to-Grant-Jerusalem-Priority-Status/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

The Jerusalem [[city council|City Council]] is a body of 31 elected members headed by the mayor, who serves a five-year term and appoints eight deputies.

Apart from the mayor and his deputies, City Council members receive no salaries and work on a voluntary basis. The longest-serving Jerusalem mayor was [[Teddy Kollek]], who spent 28 years—six consecutive terms—in office. Most of the meetings of the Jerusalem City Council are private, but each month, it holds a session that is open to the public.<ref name=corridors/> Within the city council, religious political parties form an especially powerful faction, accounting for the majority of its seats.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Jerusalem Becomes A Battleground Over Gay Rights Vs.

{{Main|Demographic history of Jerusalem}}
[[File:Demographic history of Jerusalem by religion.png|thumb|361x361px|Demographic history of Jerusalem by religion based on available data]]
Jerusalem's population size and composition has shifted many times over its 5,000-year history. Since the 19th century, the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of Jerusalem has been divided into [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish]], [[Muslim Quarter (Jerusalem)|Muslim]], [[Christian Quarter|Christian]], and [[Armenian Quarter|Armenian quarters]]. Matthew Teller writes that this convention may have originated in the [[1840–41 Royal Engineers maps of Palestine, Lebanon and Syria|1841 British Royal Engineers map of Jerusalem]],<ref name=Teller>{{cite book |last=Teller |first=Matthew |title=Nine Quarters of Jerusalem: A New Biography of the Old City |publisher=[[Profile Books]] |year=2022 |issue=map |isbn=978-1-78283-904-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgQ3EAAAQBAJ |access-date=30 May 2023 |page=Chapter 1 |quote=What wasn't corrected, though - and what, in retrospect, should have raised much more controversy than it did (it seems to have passed completely unremarked for the last 170-odd years) – was [[1840–41 Royal Engineers maps of Palestine, Lebanon and Syria|[Aldrich and Symonds's] map's]] labelling. Because here, newly arcing across the familiar quadrilateral of Jerusalem, are four double labels in bold capitals. At top left ''Haret En-Nassara'' and, beneath it, ''Christian Quarter''; at bottom left ''Haret El-Arman'' and ''Armenian Quarter''; at bottom centre ''Haret El-Yehud'' and ''Jews' Quarter''; and at top right – the big innovation, covering perhaps half the city – ''Haret El-Muslimin'' and ''Mohammedan Quarter'', had shown this before. Every map has shown it since. The idea, in 1841, of a Mohammedan (that is, Muslim) quarter of Jerusalem is bizarre. It's like a Catholic quarter of Rome. A Hindu quarter of Delhi. Nobody living there would conceive of the city in such a way. At that time, and for centuries before and decades after, Jerusalem was, if the term means anything at all, a Muslim city. Many people identified in other ways, but large numbers of Jerusalemites were Muslim and they lived all over the city. A Muslim quarter could only have been dreamt up by outsiders, searching for a handle on a place they barely understood, intent on asserting their own legitimacy among a hostile population, seeing what they wanted to see. Its only purpose could be to draw attention to what it excludes. |archive-date=9 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230609194835/https://books.google.com/books?id=SgQ3EAAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref> or at least Reverend [[George Williams (priest)|George Williams]]' subsequent labelling of it.<ref name=Teller2>{{cite book |last=Teller |first=Matthew |title=Nine Quarters of Jerusalem: A New Biography of the Old City |publisher=[[Profile Books]] |year=2022 |isbn=978-1-78283-904-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SgQ3EAAAQBAJ |access-date=30 May 2023 |page=Chapter 1 |quote=But it may not have been Aldrich and Symonds. Below the frame of their map, printed in italic script, a single line notes that 'The Writing' had been added by 'the [[George Williams (priest)|Revd. G. Williams]]' and 'the Revd. Robert Willis'… Some sources suggest [Williams] arrived before [[Michael Alexander (bishop)|[Michael] Alexander]], in 1841. If so, did he meet Aldrich and Symonds? We don't know. But Williams became their champion, defending them when the Haram inaccuracy came up and then publishing their work. The survey the two Royal Engineers did was not intended for commercial release (Aldrich had originally been sent to [[Syria (region)|Syria]] under 'secret service'), and it was several years before their military plan of Jerusalem came to public attention, published first in 1845 by their senior officer Alderson in plain form, without most of the detail and labelling, and then in full in 1849, in the second edition of Williams's book The Holy City. Did Aldrich and/or Symonds invent the idea of four quarters in Jerusalem? It's possible, but they were military surveyors, not scholars. It seems more likely they spent their very short stay producing a usable street-plan for their superior officers, without necessarily getting wrapped up in details of names and places. The 1845 publication, shorn of street names, quarter labels and other detail, suggests that… Compounding his anachronisms, and perhaps with an urge to reproduce Roman urban design in this new context, Williams writes how two main streets, north-south and east-west, 'divide Jerusalem into four quarters.' Then the crucial line: 'The subdivisions of the streets and quarters are numerous, but unimportant.' Historians will, I hope, be able to delve more deeply into Williams's work, but for me, this is evidence enough. For almost two hundred years, virtually the entire world has accepted the ill-informed, dismissive judgementalism of a jejune Old Etonian missionary as representing enduring fact about the social make-up of Jerusalem. It's shameful… With Britain's increased standing in Palestine after 1840, and the growth of interest in biblical archaeology that was to become an obsession a few decades later, it was vital for the Protestant missionaries to establish boundaries in Jerusalem… Williams spread his ideas around. {{ill|Ernst Gustav Schultz|de||he|ארנסט גוסטב שולץ}}, who came to Jerusalem in 1842 as Prussian vice-consul, writes in his 1845 book Jerusalem: ''Eine Vorlesung'' ('A Lecture'): 'It is with sincere gratitude I must mention that, on my arrival in Jerusalem, Mr Williams ... willingly alerted me to the important information that he [and] another young Anglican clergyman, Mr Rolands, had discovered about the topography of [Jerusalem].' Later come the lines: 'Let us now divide the city into quarters,' and, after mentioning Jews and Christians, 'All the rest of the city is the Mohammedan Quarter.' Included was [[Kiepert maps of Palestine and Jerusalem|a map]], drawn by [[Heinrich Kiepert]], that labelled the four quarters, mirroring Williams's treatment in ''The Holy City''. |archive-date=9 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230609194835/https://books.google.com/books?id=SgQ3EAAAQBAJ |url-status=live }}</ref>

Most population data before 1905 is based on estimates, often from foreign travellers or organisations, since previous census data usually covered wider areas such as the [[Jerusalem District]].<ref>Usiel Oskar Schmelz, in Ottoman Palestine, 1800–1914: studies in economic and social history, Gad G. Gilbar, Brill Archive, 1990 {{Google books |id=sdYUAAAAIAAJ |title=Ottoman Palestine 1800 – 1940}}</ref> These estimates suggest that since the end of the [[Crusades]], Muslims formed the largest group in Jerusalem until the mid-nineteenth century.

Between 1838 and 1876, a number of estimates exist which conflict as to whether Jews or Muslims were the largest group during this period, and between 1882 and 1922 estimates conflict as to exactly when Jews became an absolute majority of the population.

According to a study published in 2000, the percentage of Jews in the city's population had been decreasing; this was attributed to a higher Muslim [[birth rate]], and Jewish residents leaving.

In 2005, 2,850 new immigrants settled in Jerusalem, mostly from the United States, France and the former [[Soviet Union]]. In terms of the local population, the number of outgoing residents exceeds the number of incoming residents. In 2005, 16,000 left Jerusalem and only 10,000 moved in.<ref name="cbs">{{cite web |publisher=Central Bureau of Statistics |title=Press Release: Jerusalem Day |date=24 May 2006 |url=http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2006n/11_06_106e.pdf |access-date=10 March 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614014210/http://www.cbs.gov.il/hodaot2006n/11_06_106e.pdf |archive-date=14 June 2007 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Nevertheless, the population of Jerusalem continues to rise due to the high birth rate, especially in the [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jewish]] and [[Arab people|Arab]] communities. Consequently, the [[total fertility rate]] in Jerusalem (4.02) is higher than in Tel Aviv (1.98) and well above the national average of 2.90. The average size of Jerusalem's 180,000 households is 3.8 people.<ref name="cbs" />

In 2005, the total population grew by 13,000 (1.8%)—similar to the Israeli national average, but the religious and ethnic composition is shifting. While 31% of the Jewish population is made up of children below the age fifteen, the figure for the Arab population is 42%.<ref name="cbs" />

While some secular Jews leave Jerusalem for its relative lack of development and religious and political tensions, Jerusalem-born Palestinians cannot leave Jerusalem, or they lose their right to live in the city. Palestinians with a "Jerusalem resident status" are entitled to the subsidized healthcare and social security benefits Israel provides to its citizens, and have the right to vote in municipal elections, but not to be voted in municipal elections, or to vote in national elections. Arabs in Jerusalem can send their children to Israeli-run schools, although not every neighbourhood has one, and universities. Israeli doctors and highly regarded hospitals such as [[Hadassah Medical Center|Hadassah Medical Centre]] are available to residents.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-barrier4jun04,1,5853828,full.story |title=Change cast in concrete |author=Ken Ellingwood |work=Los Angeles Times |access-date=22 July 2009 |date=4 June 2007 |archive-date=14 April 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414202513/http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-barrier4jun04,1,5853828,full.story |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Within the past few years, there has been a steady increase in the Jewish birthrate and a steady decrease in the Arab birthrate.

Jerusalem has been sacred to Judaism for roughly 3000 years, to Christianity for around 2000 years, and to Islam for approximately 1400 years. The 2000 Statistical Yearbook of Jerusalem lists 1204 synagogues, 158 churches, and 73 mosques within the city.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Protecting Jerusalem's Holy Sites: A Strategy for Negotiating a Sacred Peace |url=https://archive.org/details/protectingjerusa00guin |url-access=limited |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2006 |edition=1st |last=Guinn |first=David E. |isbn=978-0-521-86662-0 |page=[https://archive.org/details/protectingjerusa00guin/page/n151 142]}}</ref> Despite efforts to maintain peaceful religious coexistence, some sites, such as the Temple Mount, have been a continuous source of friction and controversy. The [[Temple Mount]] is the holiest spot in [[Judaism]] and the third holiest site in Islam. Jews venerate it as the site of the two former [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temples]] and [[Muslim]]s believe that [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] was transported from the [[Great Mosque of Mecca]] to this location during the [[Isra and Mi'raj|Night Journey]].

== Urban structure ==

===High-rise construction===
Jerusalem has traditionally had a low-rise skyline. About 18 tall buildings were built at different times in the downtown area when there was no clear policy over the matter. One of them, Holyland Tower 1, Jerusalem's tallest building, is a [[skyscraper]] by international standards, rising 32 stories. Holyland Tower 2, which has been approved for construction, will reach the same height.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/statistics/tallest-buildings-jerusalem-israel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113081540/http://www.emporis.com/statistics/tallest-buildings-jerusalem-israel |url-status=usurped |archive-date=13 November 2012 |title=Jerusalem's tallest buildings – Top 20 &#124; Statistics |publisher=Emporis |access-date=7 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/building/holylandtower2-jerusalem-israel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113081532/http://www.emporis.com/building/holylandtower2-jerusalem-israel |url-status=usurped |archive-date=13 November 2012 |title=Holyland Tower 2 &#124; Buildings |location=Jerusalem / |publisher=Emporis |access-date=7 December 2012}}</ref>

A new master plan for the city will see many high-rise buildings, including skyscrapers, built in certain, designated areas of downtown Jerusalem. Under the plan, towers will line [[Jaffa Road]] and [[King George Street (Jerusalem)|King George Street]]. One of the proposed towers along King George Street, the Migdal Merkaz HaYekum, is planned as a 65-story building, which would make it one of the tallest buildings in Israel. At the entrance to the city, near the [[Jerusalem Chords Bridge]] and the [[Jerusalem Central Bus Station|Central Bus Station]], twelve towers rising between 24 and 33 stories will be built, as part of a complex that will also include an open square and an [[Jerusalem Binyanei HaUma Railway Station|underground train station]] serving a new express line between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and will be connected by bridges and tunnels. Eleven of the skyscrapers will be either office or apartment buildings, and one will be a 2,000-room hotel. The complex is expected to attract many businesses from Tel Aviv, and become the city's main business hub. In addition, a complex for the city's courts and the prosecutor's office will be built, as well as new buildings for Central Zionist Archives and [[Israel State Archives]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Hasson |first=Nir |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/jerusalem-skyline-to-undergo-massive-transformation-with-12-new-skyscrapers.premium-1.458031 |title=Jerusalem skyline to undergo massive transformation with 12 new skyscrapers Israel News &#124; Haaretz Daily Newspaper |work=Haaretz |date=2 April 2008 |access-date=7 December 2012 |archive-date=11 September 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911133440/http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/jerusalem-skyline-to-undergo-massive-transformation-with-12-new-skyscrapers.premium-1.458031 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Dvir |first=Noam |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/jerusalem-reaches-for-the-heavens-1.347554 |title=Jerusalem reaches for the heavens – Israel News &#124; Haaretz Daily Newspaper |work=Haaretz |date=7 March 2011 |access-date=7 December 2012 |archive-date=30 December 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233542/http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/jerusalem-reaches-for-the-heavens-1.347554 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Lidman |first=Melanie |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=281153 |title=Interior Ministry approves 12 skyscrapers for J'lem |work=The Jerusalem Post |date=14 August 2012 |access-date=7 December 2012 |archive-date=31 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121031133243/http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=281153 |url-status=live }}</ref> The skyscrapers built throughout the city are expected to contain public space, shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues, and it has been speculated that this may lead to a revitalization of downtown Jerusalem.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://israelity.com/2011/03/07/a-revitalized-downtown-jerusalem-with-skyscrapers/ |title=A revitalized downtown Jerusalem – with skyscrapers |publisher=Israelity |date=7 March 2011 |access-date=7 December 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512123533/http://israelity.com/2011/03/07/a-revitalized-downtown-jerusalem-with-skyscrapers/ |archive-date=12 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/building/migdal-merkaz-hayekum-jerusalem-israel |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230234922/http://www.emporis.com/building/migdal-merkaz-hayekum-jerusalem-israel |url-status=usurped |archive-date=30 December 2013 |title=Migdal Merkaz HaYekum &#124; Buildings |location=Jerusalem / |publisher=Emporis |access-date=12 March 2013}}</ref> In August 2015, the city council approved construction of a 344-foot pyramid-shaped skyscraper designed by [[Daniel Libeskind]] and Yigal Levi, in place of a rejected previous design by Libeskind; it is set to break ground by 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2015/08/03/daniel_libeskind_s_pyramid_in_jerusalem_the_new_skyscraper_will_be_the_city.html |title=The "Pyramid" Will Be the Newest Addition to Jerusalem's Skyline |date=3 August 2015 |work=Slate |access-date=27 November 2015 |archive-date=21 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121164737/http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_eye/2015/08/03/daniel_libeskind_s_pyramid_in_jerusalem_the_new_skyscraper_will_be_the_city.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

=== New projects in Jerusalem ===
In 2021, [[Bashar Masri]] announced and launched "Lana", a massive mix-used project in [[East Jerusalem]], which is located in the neighborhood of [[Beit Hanina]].<!--<ref name=":5" />--> The project is in a partnership between Massar International and the [[Orthodox Church of Jerusalem]]. It features 400 residential apartments along with a vibrant commercial center that hosts well-known global brands, [[cinemas]], [[restaurants]], [[cafes]], and [[offices]]. The project also includes modern educational facilities, such as a school and a [[kindergarten]], catering to the needs of residents.<!--<ref name=":7" />--> In addition to its focus on residential and commercial aspects, the Lana project emphasizes the improvement of infrastructure within the project and its surroundings.<!--<ref name=":9" />--> This involves the construction of three to four floors of underground parking to accommodate the residents' vehicles conveniently. Furthermore, there is a comprehensive plan to expand the road network surrounding the project, ensuring smooth transportation and accessibility for both residents and visitors.
