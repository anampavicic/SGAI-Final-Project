'''Tarija''' ({{IPA|es|taˈɾixa|-|ES-pe - Tarija.ogg}}) is a department in [[Bolivia]]. It is located in south-eastern Bolivia bordering with [[Argentina]] to the south and [[Paraguay]] to the east. According to the 2024 census, it has a population of 534,348 inhabitants.  It has an area of {{cvt|37623|km2}}. The city of [[Tarija]] is the capital of the department.

==Subdivisions==
[[File:Tarija dpto 001.png|270px|thumb|left|Provinces of Tarija]]

The department is divided into five provinces and one autonomous region:

# [[Gran Chaco Province]] (autonomous region)
# [[Aniceto Arce Province]]
# [[José María Avilés Province]]
# [[Cercado Province (Tarija)|Cercado Province]]
# [[Eustaquio Méndez Province]]
# [[Burdett O'Connor Province]]

Notable places in Tarija include:
* [[Villamontes]] in the department's oil-producing eastern scrubland. Villamontes has recorded the hottest temperature ever in Bolivia, {{convert|45.7|C|F|abbr=on}}, several times, most recently on 29 October 2010.<ref name="wu">{{cite web|last=Masters|first=Jeff|title=Bolivia ties its all-time heat record|url=http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1701|work=Weather Underground|publisher=Dr. Jeff Masters' WunderBlog |date=November 23, 2010 |access-date=23 November 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124020718/http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/comment.html?entrynum=1701|archive-date=24 November 2010}}</ref>

The Department of Tarija is renowned for its mild, pleasant climate, and comprises one of the country's foremost agricultural regions. Its citizens have traditionally felt close to, and conducted a lively international trade with, neighboring towns of northern Argentina.  Between 1816 and 1898, the region was part of Argentina, and was ceded to Bolivia in exchange for [[Puna de Atacama]].

Tarija boasts South America's second-largest [[natural gas]] reserves.  Increased gas revenues and foreign direct investment in gas exploration and distribution are fueling growth and turning Tarija into Bolivia's next industrial hub.  Political instability at the national level has hindered development of the reserves, as the region has chosen to align with pro-autonomy forces which aim at the devolution of considerable powers away from the central government in favor of the departments.

More than 20 different indigenous tribes, ranging in population from 20 persons up to 1500, live in the region. The [[Guaraní people|Guaraní]] is the largest tribe. 

Important battles and events related to the 1932-35 '''Chaco War''' with Paraguay took place in the department's eastern dry lands.  Tarija was the home of [[Víctor Paz Estenssoro]], leader of the 1952 Bolivian Revolution and four-time Constitutional President.

==Economy==
The main economic activity is the wine industry. The land and climate are ideal for grape and wine production. The city of [[Tarija]] holds an annual Festival of Wine and Cheese.

The petroleum industry is important not only for the region but also for the country as a whole, especially the gas industry which is exported to Argentina and Brazil. The autonomous region of [[Gran Chaco Province|Gran Chaco]] is from where most of the gas is exploited.
