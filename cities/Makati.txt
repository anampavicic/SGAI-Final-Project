==Etymology==
The name of Makati originates from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] word ''[[wikt:kati|kati]]'', meaning "[of the] [[low tide]]" or "[of the] [[ebb tide]]", attributing to the tidal movements of the adjacent [[Pasig River]]. Alternatively, the word may also mean "itchy", attributed to the ''lipang kalabaw'' plant ([[Dendrocnide meyeniana]]) that once grew in the area.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spot.ph/arts-culture/the-latest-arts-culture/108071/poblacion-makati-history-san-pedro-a4362-20240217|title=This Church Is a Marker of Poblacion's Centuries-Old Heritage|first=Mia|last=Rodriguez|date=February 17, 2024|accessdate=March 23, 2024|website=Spot.ph}}</ref>

After the destruction that the [[World War II|Second World War]] brought upon Manila, and the subsequent closure of [[Nielson Field]], the town grew rapidly, and real estate values boomed. The first of the planned communities (in what are now the barangays [[Forbes Park, Makati|Forbes Park]], Urdaneta, San Lorenzo, and [[Bel-Air, Makati|Bel-Air]] established during those times) were established in the 1950s with the efforts of its landowner, [[Ayala Corporation|Ayala y Compañía]]. At the same time, Fort McKinley, then renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]], and the then [[Philippine Army]] headquarters, became the starting point for the building up of seven more communities by military families who worked in the base area. New office buildings were built on what is now the [[Makati Central Business District]] (CBD). Since the late 1960s, Makati has transformed into the financial and commercial capital of the country.<ref name="History of Makati City">{{cite web |url=http://www.manilainfo.blogspot.com/2010/05/history-of-makati.html|title=History of Makati City |access-date=October 1, 2013 |publisher=Manila Info Blogspot}}</ref> In December 1972, two barrios (later barangay) of Makati were established at the Inner Fort Bonifacio area: [[Post Proper Northside]] and [[Post Proper Southside]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.makati.gov.ph/barangay/post-proper-north/18?tab=274|title=Barangay Post Proper Northside |access-date=January 8, 2024 |publisher=Makati Web Portal}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.makati.gov.ph/barangay/post-proper-south/19?tab=295|title=Barangay Post Proper Southside |access-date=January 8, 2024 |publisher=Makati Web Portal}}</ref>

Following the [[Assassination of Benigno Aquino Jr.|assassination]] of opposition senator [[Benigno Aquino Jr.]] on August 21, 1983, Makati became a nexus for protests against the dictatorship of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. Known as the ''Confetti Revolution'', the demonstrations held in the central business district were led partly by employees of major corporations based in the area, culminating in the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] that toppled Marcos' [[History of the Philippines (1965–1986)|20-year authoritarian regime]]. His political rival and successor, [[Corazon Aquino]]–the wife of the deceased senator Aquino–became the eleventh and first female president of the Philippines.

In January 1986, by virtue of Presidential Proclamation No. 2475, s. 1986, [[Fort Bonifacio]] and the [[Embo, Taguig|Embo]] barangays of Cembo, South Cembo, West Rembo, East Rembo, Comembo, Pembo and Pitogo were transferred to the control of Makati.<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=PP|number=2475, s. 1986|title=Excluding from the operation of Proclamation No. 423, series of 1957 which established the Fort William Mckinley (now Fort Bonifacio) Military Reservation situated in the municipalities of Pasig, Taguig, Parañaque, Makati and Pasay City, Metro Manila, a certain portion of the land embraced therein situated in the municipality of Makati and declaring the same open to disposition under the provisions of Act No. 3038 and Republic Act No. 274 in relation the provisions of the Public Land Act, as amended.|date=January 7, 1986|accessdate=September 5, 2023|url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1986/01/07/proclamation-no-2475-s-1986/|publisher=[[Official Gazette (Philippines)|Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines]]}}</ref> The proclamation was contested by [[Taguig]] because it altered the municipality's boundaries unconstitutionally, which resulted in a three-decade long [[Makati–Taguig boundary dispute|territorial dispute]].

During the [[1989 Philippine coup attempt]], the Makati central business district was occupied by [[Reform the Armed Forces Movement]] forces seeking to overthrow President [[Corazon Aquino]]. The resulting standoff lasted from December 2 to 9 and contributed to massive financial losses incurred due to the paralysis in the economic hub.<ref>{{cite news |author=Davide Commission |title=The Final Report of the Fact-Finding Commission: V: The Failed December 1989 Coup: Pre-Coup Events and Battle Zone Narratives |url=https://www.officialgazette.gov.ph/1990/10/03/the-final-report-of-the-fact-finding-commission-v-the-failed-december-1989-coup-pre-coup-events-and-battle-zone-narratives/ |work=Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |date=October 3, 1990 |access-date=May 25, 2024}}</ref>

On May 17, 2000, at 5:02&nbsp;p.m. [[Philippine Standard Time|PHT]], the [[Glorietta]] mall located inside the [[Ayala Center]] was bombed, injuring 13 persons. According to local authorities, the homemade bomb originated from the restroom of a restaurant and affected an adjacent video arcade. The bombing was said to be the precursor of the May 21, 2000 [[SM Megamall]] bombing and the [[Rizal Day bombings]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/65115/GMA-News-Research-A-record-of-mall-explosions-in-RP |work=GMA News|title=A record of mall explosions in RP |date=October 19, 2007 |access-date=May 23, 2014}}</ref>

On October 19, 2007, an [[2007 Glorietta explosion|explosion in Glorietta 2]] left eleven people dead and injured more than a hundred. Initially, authorities said that it was caused by a [[liquefied petroleum gas]] explosion at a restaurant, but later began investigating the possibility that the explosion may have been a [[C-4 (explosive)|C-4 bomb]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=95665 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|date=October 20, 2008 |access-date=May 23, 2014 |publisher=Agence France-Presse |last=Gutierrez |first=Jason |title=Military explosives may have been used in bomb blast |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080222054008/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/nation/view_article.php?article_id=95665 |archive-date=February 22, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/65209/C-4-bomb-component-used-in-Glorietta-blast---PNP-chemist |work=GMA News|title=C-4 bomb component used in Glorietta blast – PNP chemist |date=October 20, 2007 |access-date=May 23, 2014}}</ref>

In April 2022, Makati lost in the decades-long [[Makati–Taguig boundary dispute|territorial dispute with Taguig]], which was ruled with finality a year later in April 2023. The city ceded its territorial and political jurisdiction of the ten [[Embo, Taguig|Embo barangays]] to [[Taguig]], thus losing an estimated 300,000 people from its population.<ref name="laud" /><ref name="cayabyab" /><ref name="dilg" /> Because of Taguig's territorial takeover, 10 barangays out of 13 barangays were removed from [[Makati's 2nd congressional district|Makati's 2nd district]], which put it into limbo as it does not meet the constitutional requirement of 250,000 people and the city may be reduced back to a [[Makati's at-large congressional district|single congressional district]].<ref name="julie" /> But pending legislation, the status quo of its existence is expected to prevail.

==Geography==
[[File:Makati City, EDSA from air (Makati; 04-22-2024).jpg|thumb|300px|Aerial view of Makati, 2024]]
Makati is located within the circle of 14′40″ °N and 121′3″ °E right at the center of Metro Manila. The city is bounded on the north by the [[Pasig River]], facing [[Mandaluyong]], on the east by [[Taguig]], on the southwest by [[Pasay]], and on the northwest by the city of [[Manila]]. Makati has a total land area of {{convert|21.57|km2|2|abbr=out|sp=us}}. <!-- updated area after transfer of 10 barangays to Taguig --> Its territory also surrounds the [[Manila South Cemetery]], an [[exclave]] of [[San Andres, Manila|San Andres]] district of [[Manila]].<ref>{{cite PH act|chamber=GR|number=L-22201|title=Jacobo Zobel, et al. vs. the City of Manila |date=January 12, 1925 |url=http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1925/jan1925/gr_l-22201_1925.html |access-date=June 23, 2023 |publisher=The Lawphil Project - Arellano Law Foundation, Inc.}}</ref> 

===Barangays===
{{Further|Makati–Taguig boundary dispute}}
Since November 2023, Makati is divided into 23 [[barangay]]s (the smallest local government units) which handle governance in a much smaller area. These barangays are grouped into [[Legislative districts of Makati|two congressional districts]] where each district is represented by a congressman in the country's [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]]. The [[Makati's 1st congressional district|1st Congressional District]] is composed of the barangays straddling [[EDSA]], the barangays to the north and west of them, while excluding Guadalupe Viejo, while the [[Makati's 2nd congressional district|2nd Congressional District]] is to the south and east of the 1st District, including the aforementioned barangay. The districts elect the sixteen members of the [[Sangguniang Panlungsod|city council]], eight from each of the two councilor districts that are coextensive with the congressional districts.

Cembo, South Cembo, West Rembo, East Rembo, Comembo, Pembo, Pitogo, [[Post Proper Northside]], [[Post Proper Southside]], and Rizal, collectively known as the [[Embo, Taguig|Embo barangays]], were officially part of Makati from 1986 to 2023, when these were transferred to [[Taguig]] by virtue of the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]]'s ruling that year to finally side with Taguig regarding the cities' territorial dispute.<ref name="laud">{{cite news|url=https://mb.com.ph/2023/4/3/taguig-lgu-lauds-sc-decision-over-fort-bonifacio-ownership|title=Taguig LGU lauds SC decision over Fort Bonifacio ownership|first=Jonathan|last=Hicap|date=April 3, 2023|work=Manila Bulletin}}</ref><ref name="cayabyab">{{cite news|url=https://www.philstar.com/nation/2023/04/05/2256966/makati-raises-constitutional-issues-bgc-land-dispute|title=Makati raises 'constitutional' issues in BGC land dispute|first=Marc Jayson|last=Cayabyab|date=April 5, 2023|accessdate=April 6, 2023|work=The Philippine Star}}</ref><ref name="dilg">{{cite news |last1=Argosino |first1=Faith |title=DILG-Taguig to handle programs, projects in 10 former Makati barangays |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1856884/fwd-dilg-on-transfer-of-programs-projects-of-embo-barangays-from-makati-to-taguig |access-date=11 November 2023 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=8 November 2023 |language=en}}</ref><ref name="julie">{{cite news |last1=Aurelio |first1=Julie |title=SC ruling opens issue on Taguig House seats |url=https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1805272/sc-ruling-opens-issue-on-taguig-house-seats |access-date=July 23, 2023 |newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=July 22, 2023 |language=en}}</ref>

===Climate===
Under the [[Köppen climate classification]] system, the city features a [[tropical monsoon climate]]. Together with the rest of the Philippines, Makati lies entirely within the tropics. Its proximity to the equator means that the temperature range is very small, rarely going lower than {{convert|20|°C|0|abbr=on}} or going higher than {{convert|38|°C|0|abbr=on}}. However, humidity levels are usually very high which makes it feel much warmer. It has a distinct, albeit relatively short dry season from January through May, and a relatively lengthy wet season from June through December.

Pasay Road, formerly known as Culi-culi and Pio del Pilar, is the first railway station in Makati, having been initially opened in 1908. Dela Rosa replaced the old [[Buendia station (PNR)|Buendia]] station in 2017. All aforementioned stations are part of the [[PNR South Main Line]]. The operations of [[PNR Metro Commuter Line]], which serves the South Main Line, is currently suspended due to the construction of [[North–South Commuter Railway]], which will have stations at Buendia and EDSA.

In 2013, the [[National Economic and Development Authority]] (NEDA) worked on a feasibility study for a $1.75 billion monorail project. The proposed {{convert|12.56|km|adj=on|sp=us}} elevated monorail is envisioned to connect Makati, [[Bonifacio Global City]] and Pasay through MRT Line 3, as well as [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]]. The present alignment being considered starts from the Guadalupe MRT station, enters Bonifacio Global City through the north gate and ends at Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 3.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=Philippine Daily Inquirer|url=http://business.inquirer.net/108015/japan-funding-eyed-for-feasibility-study-of-p70b-bgc-monorail|title=Makati BGC NAIA monorail project|access-date=June 25, 2013 }}</ref>

In 2015, NEDA approved the Public-Private Partnership project for the Makati-Pasay-Taguig Mass Transit System Loop which will have stations at key points in Makati, namely: Buendia MRT station, Ayala-EDSA, Ayala Triangle, Makati Post Office and PNR-Buendia. The project was later shelved and partially revived in 2018 as the [[Makati Intra-City Subway]] which inherits most of the stations in Makati.<ref>{{Cite news|title = Philippines' first subway gets OK from NEDA-ICC|url = http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/business/01/15/15/philippines-first-subway-gets-ok-neda-icc|access-date = May 23, 2015 |date = January 15, 2015 |work=ABS-CBN News|publisher = ABS-CBN Corporation}}</ref> The Intra-City Subway project was later stalled in 2023 due to the transfer of the Embo barangays to Taguig, which won the territorial dispute with Makati.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/metro-manila/makati-subway-project-needs-rework-after-supreme-court-ruling-on-land-dispute/|title=$3.5-billion Makati subway project needs rework after Supreme Court ruling on land dispute|first=James Patrick|last=Cruz|date=September 6, 2023|accessdate=March 15, 2024|work=Rappler}}</ref>

The current seal of Makati, adopted in August 1995,<ref>{{cite news|title=Makati City council okays new seal|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=mY0mAAAAIBAJ&sjid=zwoEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2127%2C2233949|access-date=February 13, 2022|work=[[Manila Standard]]|publisher=Kamahalan Publishing Corp.|date=August 16, 1995|page=19}}</ref> composes of the old outline map of Makati containing 33 rays, green buildings, a church, and a river. Those were first used on Makati's final municipal seal from 1990 to 1995.

The map of Makati is in golden yellow color which represents wealth and prosperity. The rays represent the 33 [[barangays]] of Makati (including the [[Embo, Taguig|10 Embo barangays]] ceded to Taguig in 2023) which are described to be "surging forward to a brighter future". The color of the buildings symbolizes life which is described to reflect a "new progressive" Makati. The church represents the oldest church of Makati, the [[Nuestra Señora de Gracia Church|Nuestra Señora de Gracia]], which was used by Filipino revolutionaries against the Spaniards in 1896 and the Americans in 1898. The waves represent the tide which came from the phrase "''Makati na, Kumakati na''" which means ebbing tide in Tagalog.<ref name=makatiportal>{{cite web|title=Seals and Logos|url=https://www.makati.gov.ph/cms/the-city/quick-information/75?content=795|website=Makati Web Portal|publisher=City Government of Makati|access-date=July 2, 2015}}</ref>
