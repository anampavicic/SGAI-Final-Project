'''Tuyên Quang''' is a [[Provinces of Vietnam|province]] of [[Vietnam]], located in the [[Đông Bắc|northeastern]] part of the country to the northwest of [[Hanoi]], at the centre of [[Lo River|Lô River]] valley, a tributary of the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]]. Its capital is [[Tuyên Quang]].<ref name=Tuyen>{{Cite web|title=Chapter 4 – results from Tuyên Quang province|url=http://www.idrc.ca/en/ev-25323-201-1-DO_TOPIC.html|access-date=2010-06-24|publisher=International development Research Centre}}</ref> The province had a population of 784,811 in 2019, with a density of 130 persons per km<sup>2</sup> over a total land area of {{convert|5867.3|km2|mi2}}.<ref name=census/>

Tuyên Quang borders [[Hà Giang Province|Hà Giang]] to the north, [[Cao Bằng Province|Cao Bằng]] to the northeast, [[Bắc Kạn Province|Bắc Kạn]] and [[Thái Nguyên Province|Thái Nguyên]] to the east, [[Vĩnh Phúc Province|Vĩnh Phúc]] to the south, [[Phú Thọ Province|Phú Thọ]] to the southwest, and [[Yên Bái Province|Yên Bái]] to the west.<ref name=wom>{{Cite web|url=http://www.wompom.ca/vietnam/vnprovinc211.htm|title=provinces of North East Region Tuyen Quang Province|access-date=2010-06-23|publisher=Wampom}}</ref>

==History==
{{Further|Tuyên Quang|Battle of Yu Oc|Battle of Hoa Moc}}
[[File:Province de Tuyen-Quang (1909).jpg|thumb|left|Map of Tuyen Quang province in 1909]]
[[File:Bản vẽ thành Tuyên Quang.jpg|thumb|Drawing of Tuyên Quang citadel in the Nguyễn dynasty]]
Tuyên Quang, the capital city of the province has a rich history of the battles fought in the region. The earliest history is to the [[First Indochina War]] when it served as a garrison. During this war the [[Viet Minh]] made the Legionnaires surrender at the memorial to the Battle of Tuyên Quang. Another historical event is the [[Siege of Tuyên Quang]], commemorated in the first verse of ''[[Le Boudin]]'', its principal marching song. The French garrison posted at Tuyên Quang defended the town for four months against 12,000 troops of the [[Yunnan]] Army and the [[Black Flag Army]]. Two companies of the [[French Foreign Legion]]1 company of Tonkinese Tirailleurs, 31 naval gunners with four mountain guns, and eight sappers, commanded by Sergeant Bobillot, plus the gunboat Mitrailleuse. were involved during the [[Sino-French War]] (August 1884 to April 1885).

Tuyên Quang was once entirely settled by Thai people, but from the 13th century onwards were integrated into the [[Trần dynasty]], who named it Quốc Oai before naming it Châu Tuyên Quang. Under the rule of Emperor [[Trần Hiến Tông]] (reigned 1329–1341), Tuyên Quang was given the status of a {{Lang|vi|trấn}}, before being categorised as {{Lang|vi|thành phủ}} when the [[Ming dynasty]] of China briefly annexed Vietnam at the start of the 15th century. After [[Lê Lợi]] expelled the Chinese and started the [[Lê dynasty]], he made Tuyên Hóa a part of [[Tây Đạo]]. During the reign of Emperor [[Lê Thánh Tông]], Tuyên Quang comprised one {{Lang|vi|phủ}} and five districts ({{Lang|vi|huyện}}) and became the province of [[Minh Quang]] under the rule of Emperor [[Lê Uy Mục]]. During the reign of [[Lê Trang Tông]], Minh Quang became An Tại, and control of the region was given to the Vũ family, ethnic Thai people.

[[File:Chiem Hoa.jpg|thumb|left|Chiem Hoa District]]

By the end of the 17th century, the Lê dynasty sent ethnic Vietnamese officials to the area to supervise the Thais. After [[Gia Long]] started the Nguyễn dynasty, he changed the region to the {{Lang|vi|trấn}} of Tuyên Quang, and it became a province under the rule of his successor Emperor [[Minh Mạng]]. When the French carried out their colonial conquest, the {{Lang|vi|phủ}} of Yên Bình was at the forefront of the resistance movement. People from the [[Người Thái (Việt Nam)|Thái]], [[Người Mường|Mường]], [[Người H'Mông|Mèo]], [[Người Thổ|Thổ]], [[Người Nùng|Nùng]] and another ethnic groups engaged the French in many battles in the area in 1884–1885. The [[Black Flag Army|Black Flags]] were also prominent. It was not until 1894 that the French had pacified the region. Prior to 1975, the province comprised the districts of [[Yên Sơn District|Yên Sơn]], [[Yên Bình]], [[Hàm Yên]], [[Sơn Dương]], [[Chiêm Hóa]] and [[Đại Thi]].

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Tam Dao mountain range.jpg|thumb|right|Tam Dao mountain range.]]
The province has widely varying topography covering high mountains  deep valleys; the dominant elevation of the province is in the range {{convert|200|-|600|m|ft}}. The province is in the foothills of the Northern Highlands, which forms a broad crescent around the [[Tonkin Delta]]; its southern part has narrow river basins and mountain ranges (elevation below {{convert|300|m|ft}}) and the northern part, particularly in Chiêm Hoá and Nà Hang districts the slopes are steep with hills taller than {{convert|1400|m|ft}} (the highest mountain is Cham Chu at {{convert|1589|m|ft}}). The Tam Dao range is located in this province.<ref name=Tuyen/><ref name=Environment>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ekn.se/upload/Exhibit%20%203%20EIA.pdf|title=Environmental Impact Assessment: A Hoa Pulp Mill Plant Tuyen Quang Province|pages=27–33|access-date=2010-08-14|publisher=Environment Treatment Technology Center, Chemical High Command, Ministry of Defense}}</ref>

In the southern part of the province, about {{convert|100|km|mi}} away from Hanoi as the crow flies, is the provincial capital, also bearing the name of the capital city of the province, Tuyên Quang  has an elevation below {{convert|100|m|ft}} located on the right bank of the Lô River, a tributary of the [[Red River (Asia)|Red River]] which rises at Hà Giang, near the Chinese border. Its major tributary is the Gâm River on its left bank. The province has a land area {{convert|5900|km2|mi2}}. The province's territory has only 7.2% of natural forest comprising both rain forest and monsoon forest.<ref name=Tuyen/>

===Water resources===
The distribution of river and stream network in the province is 0.98&nbsp;km/km<sup>2</sup>. There are three main rivers: Lô, Gâm and Pho Day. The Lô River originates in Van Nam, China, flows through Hà Giang to this province; it flows for a length of{{convert|145|km|mi}} in the province and drains an area of {{convert|2090|km2|mi2}}. Its maximum flow is 11,700&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s, while the minimum flow recorded is 128&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s. It is a navigable river and is a major water route of the province to carry goods to other provinces. The second major river is the Gâm, which originates in China and flows through Cao Bằng and Hà Giang, before entering Tuyên Quang. The Gâm joins the Lô at Tu Hiep. The river flows for {{convert|170|km|mi}} length in the province draining an area of {{convert|2870|km2|mi2}}. The next major river of importance is the Pho Day River which rises in the Tam Dao Mountains in [[Bắc Kạn province]]. It traverses {{convert|84|km|mi}} in the province through Yên Sơn, Sơn Dương District to Phú Thọ, and has a drainage area of {{convert|800|km2|mi2}}. The navigation possibilities of this river are very limited. In addition to the three major rivers, there is an abundance of small rivers, lakes and ponds (2000 ponds). The total volume of surface water available from all these sources is estimated at 10 BCM. River water is potable, clear and tasteless, has a pH value ranging from 6.5 and 7.5. The underground water resources of the province, according to preliminary assessments done in the past, was about 3,500,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/ngd. The water is potable with low mineral content. In addition, the province has three mineral water sources: two hot and one cool.<ref name=Environment/>

==Mineral resources==
: The province has rich metal-mineral and non-metal resources of
* Iron ore (10 iron mines with reserve of 10-13 million tonnes in Phuc Ninh, Ha Van, Thau Cay, Cay Vaum Cay Nhan, Dong Ky Lam, Lang Muong and Lang Lech
* Lead-zinc ore mines (24 mines) and ore sites at Thuong am-Son Duong, Dong Quan-Binh Ca, Nang Kha-Na Hang, Ham Yen-Bac Nhung, Ba Xu-Kien Thiet and Hung Loi-Trung Minh (Thanh Coc) with estimated reserves of lead–zinc (level C2)- 619,298 tonnes, Pl: 981,482 tonnes, level P2: 1,032,897 tonnes;<ref name=mineral>{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/country/2002/vmmyb02.pdf |title=The Mineral Industry of Vietnam |agency= US Geological Survey Year Book |author= John C. Wu |page=25.3 |access-date=2010-08-14 |publisher= Minerals USGS}}</ref>
* Tin ore in Bac Lung, Ky Lam, Thanh Son, Khang Nhat (Ngoi Lem) and Ngon Dong with estimated reserves of 50,000 tonnes
* Vonfram ore with reserves of mineral sand ore of level Cl+ C2= 674 tonnes WO3
* [[Manganese]] at six locations in [[Chiêm Hoá District|Chiêm Hoá]], with reserves of (in zone of Lang Bai level Cl + C2)- 170,149 tonnes
* [[Antimony]] with reserves of 1,191,000 tonnes
:Khuon Phuc, Lang Vai and Hòa Phú mines have also been explored with nine ore sites: Lang Can, Phieng Giao, Lang ai, Na Mo, Khuon Vai, Coc Tay, Nui Quit and Lung Luong, Nui Than. [[Barite]] has been found at 24 ore sites, which could be exploited by open cast mines, in Sơn Dương, Yên Sơn and Chiêm Hoá districts. [[Kaolin]]/[[felspar]] is found in Sơn Dương and Yên Sơn districts with estimated reserves of 5 million tonnes. Limestone in great abundance in the entire province, assessed to be of several billion cubic metres. Clay is well distributed in many areas with reserves of several million tons. Minerals such as pyrite, gold and pebble sand found in small quantities in the province. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Transport network===
The province has no railway or airline links. However, the province has National Highway No. 2 and 37 road network. Major water transport routes are on the Lô, Gâm, and Pho Day Rivers which connect Tuyên Quang with neighboring provinces. Tuyên Quang township is {{convert|165|km|mi}} from Hanoi by road.<ref name=wom/><ref name=Environment/>

===Climate===
The tropical climatic seasons are the monsoon and dry season. Rainfall occurs generally during the monsoon months of May to October, which is also the summer season. However, it is unevenly distributed due to varying topography. The average annual rainfall in the province is {{convert|1500|mm|in}} in 150 rainy days. Monsoon rainfall accounts for about 94% while the balance occurs during the dry months, which is the winter period. Depending on the season, the wind direction also varies significantly. Thunderstorms from April to August are also a climatic feature with maximum recorded rainfall of {{convert|100|mm|in}} during one thunderstorm in some areas. Cyclonic effects with wind speed reaching {{convert|40|m|ft}}/s have been recorded in some areas. Cyclones occur every year during the transitional months between two seasons namely April and May. Other weather features noted are Mist and the hoarfrost; mist occurs at the beginning of the winter months; recorded for 25 to 55 days in the south and 60 to 80 days in the North. Hoarfrost occurs once every 2 years on average in January or November and for just one day.<ref name=Environment/>

The temperate to subtropical, tropical climate facilitates growth of natural flora and a diversified plant mechanism. The northern region of the province experiences a long winter with low temperatures. However, the region gets more rain during summer. The southern region has a diversified climate with a short winter and hot summer followed by a monsoonal season. Frequently, the strong intensity rainstorms result in floods, which occasionally cause damage to people and property. The average temperature in the province is {{convert|22.4|C|F}}.<ref name=wom/><ref name=Environment/>

==Administrative divisions==
Tuyên Quang is subdivided into seven district-level sub-divisions:

* Six districts:

==Economy and development==
[[File:Tuyen Quang.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Agricultural fields in Tuyên Quang]]
The province's economy is dependent on its primary industries.<ref name=wom/> In 2005, the economic breakdown is as follows: construction 30.7%, services 33.6%, agriculture, forestry and fishery 35.7%. Rice is the staple food. Also grown are [[maize]], [[cassava]], [[potato]], [[tea]], [[lemongrass]] and citrus fruits, as well as beans. Livestock includes [[Water buffalo|buffalo]], pigs and poultry. The most important mineral reserves are zinc ore, manganese ore, tin and antimony. The province is also a producer of paper, cement and limestone.

The land economy is dependent on the agricultural growth in the province, which is dependent to a land area of {{convert|1051|km2|mi2}}) under agriculture, about 20% of the province. However, this has also caused deforestation. However, the practice of shifting cultivation called the "swidden agriculture"(practiced by ethnic minorities) is limited to 3000&nbsp;ha, as in 1992, and is said to be reducing<ref name=Tuyen/> under a [[UNDP]] funded project; has covered the aquaculture development in ponds. However, the Lô River which flows through the province has much potential for development of aquaculture.<ref name=aqua>{{Cite web|url=http://mekonginfo.org/mrc_en%5CContact.nsf/0/2B49690F4E42255487256906003074BE/$FILE/undp.pdf|title=Aquaculture and poverty reduction: Experiences of U N D P Vietnam|work=IFAD/UNDP Participatory Resources Management Project (PRMP) in Tuyên Quang Province|access-date=2010-08-14|publisher=Mekonginfo.org}}</ref>

The province has 900 villages in upland areas, which are inhabited mostly by impoverished ethnic minorities. Under an IFAD funded project for Rural Development (IFAD loan:US$20.9 million), agricultural training has been provided to the farmers on pilot plots to teach them to adopt new practices and techniques in the field of agriculture, animal husbandry, credit, food storage and processing that are appropriate for the local environment. In addition, infrastructure, health services and village level institutions like the savings and credit groups, user groups and village development boards have also been supported by this funding.<ref name=Poor>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifad.org/operations/projects/regions/Pi/factsheets/vn.pdf|title=Enabling poor rural people to overcome|page=6|access-date=2010-09-01|publisher=International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)}}</ref> The forestry sector of the economy is influenced by the Bai Bang pulp and paper mill, said to be one of the largest in Vietnam, located in the adjoining Vinh Phu Province. It was established in the 1980s with financial help from Sweden. Commercial logging is carried out in the plantation forests by the state-sponsored enterprises to supply pulp to the factory.<ref name=Tuyen/>
