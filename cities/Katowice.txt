Katowice was founded as a village in the 16th century, whereas several modern districts of Katowice were founded as villages in the [[Middle Ages]]. Throughout the mid-18th century, Katowice grew following the discovery of rich [[coal]] reserves in the area. In the first half of the 19th century, intensive [[Industrial Revolution|industrialization]] transformed local mills and farms into industrial [[Steel mill|steelworks]], mines, [[Foundry|foundries]] and artisan workshops. The city has since reshaped its economy from a heavy industry-based one to professional services, education and healthcare. The entire metropolitan area is the [[List of cities by GDP|16th most economically powerful city by GDP]] in the [[European Union]] with an output amounting to $114.5&nbsp;billion.

==History==
{{further|History of Katowice}}

===Before the industrial revolution===
[[File:Katowice - Akta Wizytacji parafii w Bogucicach (1598).jpg|left|thumb|A fragment from the [[Bogucice]] Parish visitation report from 1598 that mentions the name Katowice for the first time]]
The area around Katowice, in [[Upper Silesia]], has been inhabited by [[Lechites|Lechitic]] [[Silesian tribes]] from its earliest documented history.<ref name="auto">{{cite web|last=silnet.pl|title=Historia miasta i dzielnic – Katowice|url=https://mojekatowice.pl/p,s,historia.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202042336/https://mojekatowice.pl/p,s,historia.html|archive-date=2 February 2017|access-date=25 January 2017}}</ref> While the name Katowice (''Katowicze'') is mentioned for the first time in 1598, other villages and settlements that would eventually become parts of modern Katowice have been established earlier, with ''Dąb'' being the oldest, mentioned in 1299 for the first time in a document issued by Duke [[Casimir of Bytom]]. [[Bogucice]], Ligota, Szopenice and Podlesie were all established in early 14th century. Aside from farming, people living in the area would also work in hammer mills: the first one, ''Kuźnica Bogucka'', is mentioned in 1397.

The area which would become Katowice was initially ruled by the Polish [[Silesian Piasts|Silesian Piast]] dynasty until its extinction.<ref name="auto1">{{cite web|title=Katowice, Poland – A City Guide – Cracow Life|url=http://www.local-life.com/krakow/articles/katowice|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316025022/http://www.local-life.com/krakow/articles/katowice|archive-date=16 March 2017|access-date=15 March 2017}}</ref> From 1327, the region was under administration of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] under the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. As part of the [[Lands of the Bohemian Crown|Bohemian Crown]], it was passed to the [[Habsburg monarchy]] of [[Austria]] in 1526.<ref>{{cite web|title=History – Katowice|url=https://www.inyourpocket.com/katowice/history|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316024836/https://www.inyourpocket.com/katowice/history|archive-date=16 March 2017|access-date=15 March 2017}}</ref> In 1742, along with most of [[Silesia]], it was seized by [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] following the [[First Silesian War]]. The two subsequent [[Silesian Wars]] left the area severely depopulated and with an economy in ruins. In 1838, Franz von Winckler bought Katowice from Karl Friedrich Lehmann and in 1841, he made it the headquarters of his estate.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Moskal|first=Jerzy|title=Bogucice, Załęże et nova villa Katowice – Rozwój w czasie i przestrzeni|publisher=Wydawnictwo Śląsk|year=1993|isbn=83-85831-35-5|location=Katowice|pages=23–25}}</ref>

===Emergence as an industrial centre===
[[File:Katowice Huta Baildon.jpg|thumb|left|Baildon steelworks, 19th century]]
On 3 October 1846, the works of the final stage of the [[Wrocław|Breslau]]-[[Mysłowice|Myslowitz]] (''Wrocław-Mysłowice'') rail line ended, built and operated by the [[Upper Silesian Railway]]. It was opened by king [[Frederick William IV of Prussia]].<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Nadolski|first1=Przemysław|title=Węzeł Kolejowy Gliwice|last2=Roszak|first2=Tomasz|last3=Soida|first3=Krzysztof|last4=Wieczorek|first4=Edward|publisher=Eurosprinter|year=2010|isbn=978-83-931006-1-3|location=Rybnik}}</ref> A year later, on 6 August 1847, the first train arrived at the new [[Katowice historic railway station|Katowice station]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-08-02 |title="No limits" {{!}} The Architecture of Industrial Agglomerations {{!}} Uniwersytet Śląski w Katowicach |url=https://us.edu.pl/en/no-limits-architektura-aglomeracji-przemyslowych/ |access-date=2024-06-28 |language=en-US}}</ref>

The railway connection with major European cities (Katowice gained connections to [[Berlin]], [[Kraków]], [[Vienna]] and [[Warsaw]], among others, between 1847 and 1848) fostered economic and population growth. The population grew enough to erect the first [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] church on 29 September 1858 ([[Church of the Resurrection, Katowice|Church of the Resurrection]]), and the first [[Catholic Church|Catholic church]] two years later, on 11 November 1860. Katowice (then: ''Kattowitz'') gained [[Town privileges|city status]] on 11 September 1865 in the Prussian [[Province of Silesia]], by the act of the king [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I Hohenzollern]].<ref name="auto" />

The city flourished due to large mineral (especially coal) deposits in the area. Extensive city growth and prosperity depended on the coal mining and steel industries, which took off during the [[Industrial Revolution]]. The city was inhabited mainly by [[Germans]], [[Polish people|Poles]] incl. [[Silesians]], and [[Jews]]. In 1884, 36 Jewish [[Zionism|Zionist]] delegates met here, forming the [[Hovevei Zion]] movement. Previously part of the Beuthen district, in 1873 it became the capital of the new [[East Upper Silesia|Kattowitz district]]. On 1 April 1899, the city was separated from the district, becoming an [[independent city]].

In 1882, the Upper Silesian Coal and Steelworks Company (''Oberschlesischer Berg- und Hüttenmännischer Verein'') moved its headquarters to Katowice, followed by creation of the Upper Silesian Coal Convention (''Oberschlesische Kohlen-Konvention'') in 1898. Civic development followed industrial development: in 1851, the first post office opens in Katowice, and in 1893 the current regional post office headquarters have been opened; in 1871 the first middle school was opened (later expanded to high school); in 1889, Katowice got a district court; in 1895, the city bath opened and regional headquarters of the [[Prussian state railways]] has been established in the city; in 1907, the city theater (currently the [[Silesian Theatre]]) opened.

Under the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after [[World War I]], the [[Upper Silesia plebiscite]] was organised by the [[League of Nations]]. Though Kattowitz proper voted 22,774 to remain in Germany and 3,900 for Poland,<ref name="Urban">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bM2kvVUpCPYC&q=urban+danzig|title=Von Krakau bis Danzig|access-date=21 March 2009|publisher=[[Thomas Urban|Urban, Thomas]]|year=2004|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024011628/http://books.google.de/books?id=bM2kvVUpCPYC&printsec=frontcover&dq=urban+danzig&lr=&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA143,M1|archive-date=24 October 2012|url-status=live|isbn=9783406510823}}</ref> it was attached to Poland as the larger district voted 66,119 for Poland and 52,992 for Germany.<ref>Documents on British foreign policy, 1919–1939 Great Britain. Foreign Office, Ernest [[Llewellyn Woodward]] page 44</ref> Following the [[Silesian Uprisings]] of 1918–21 Katowice became part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] with some autonomy for the [[Silesian Parliament]] as a constituency and the Silesian Voivodeship Council as the executive body. In 1924, the surrounding villages and towns were incorporated into Katowice, and the number of inhabitants increased to over 112,000, since then the number of Poles exceeded the number of Germans – throughout the interwar period, the number of Germans decreased (in 1925 they constituted 12% of the inhabitants of Katowice, and in 1939 only 6%, while Poles constituted 93%). At the end of the interwar period, the number of inhabitants exceeded 134,000.

From 1926 to 1933, Katowice and the Polish part of Upper Silesia were connected with [[Gdynia]] and the Polish part of [[Pomerania]] through the [[Polish Coal Trunk-Line]] ({{langx|pl|Magistrala Węglowa}}).

===World War II===
During the early stages of [[World War II]] and the [[Invasion of Poland|Poland Campaign]], Katowice was essentially abandoned by the [[Polish Land Forces]], which had to position itself around [[Kraków]]. Nevertheless, the city was [[Defense of Katowice|defended by local Poles]], and the invading Germans immediately carried out [[Katowice massacre|massacres of captured Polish defenders]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Warzecha|first=Bartłomiej|year=2003|title=Niemieckie zbrodnie na powstańcach śląskich w 1939 roku|magazine=Biuletyn Instytutu Pamięci Narodowej|language=pl|publisher=[[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]]|issue=12–1 (35–36)|page=55|issn=1641-9561}}</ref> In the following weeks the German ''[[Einsatzkommando]] 1'' was stationed in the city, and its units were responsible for many [[Nazi crimes against the Polish nation|crimes against Poles]] committed in the region.<ref>Warzecha, p. 56</ref>

[[File:Katowice - Wieża spadochronowa 01.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Parachute Tower in Katowice|Parachute Tower]], one of the symbols of the Polish [[Defense of Katowice]]]]
Under [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|German occupation]] many of the city's historical and iconic monuments were destroyed, most notably the [[Great Synagogue (Katowice)|Great Katowice Synagogue]], which was burned to the ground on 4 September 1939. This was followed by the alteration of street names and the introduction of strict rules. Additionally, the use of [[Polish language|Polish]] in public conversations was banned. The German administration was also infamous for organising public executions of civilians<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Katowice/Katowice.html|title=Katowice, Poland|access-date=17 March 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318003331/http://www.jewishgen.org/yizkor/Katowice/Katowice.html|archive-date=18 March 2017}}</ref> and by the middle of 1941, most of the Polish and Jewish population was [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|expelled]].

Significant parts of the downtown and inner suburbs were demolished during the occupation. As a result, the authorities were able to preserve the central district in its prewar character.

===Postwar period===
The postwar period of Katowice was characterised by the time of heavy industry development in the Upper Silesian region, which helped the city in regaining its status as the most industrialised Polish city and a major administrative centre. As the city developed so briskly, the 1950s marked a significant increase in its population and an influx of migrants from the [[Kresy|Eastern Borderlands]], the so-called ''Kresy''. The city area began to quickly expand by incorporating the neighbouring communes and counties. However, the thriving industrial city also had a dark period in its short but meaningful history. Most notably, between 7 March 1953 and 10 December 1956, Katowice was called ''Stalinogród'' in honour of [[Joseph Stalin]], leader of the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dziennikzachodni.pl/artykul/3355309,katowice-zniknely-powstal-stalinogrod-to-juz-61-lat,id,t.html|title=Katowice zniknęły.

The following decades were more memorable in the history of Katowice. Regardless of its industrial significance, it started to become an important cultural and educational centre in Central and Eastern Europe. In 1968, the [[University of Silesia in Katowice]], the largest and most valued college in the area, was founded. Simultaneously the construction of large housing estates began to evolve. Furthermore, many representative structures were erected at that time, including the [[Silesian Insurgents' Monument]] (1967) and [[Spodek]] (1971), which have become familiar landmarks and tourist sights. The 1960s and 1970s saw the evolution of [[Modern architecture|modernist architecture]] and [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalism]]. Katowice eventually developed into one of the most modernist post-war cities of Poland.[[File:MOs810 WG 23 2016 (Zaglebiowskie Zakamarki) (Katowice, 3 Maja).jpg|thumb|[[3 Maja Street, Katowice|3 Maja Street]] is one of the main promenades in the city]]

One of the most dramatic events in the history of the city occurred on 16 December 1981. It was then that 9 protesters died (7 were shot dead; 2 died from injury complications) and another 21 were [[Pacification of Wujek|wounded in the pacification of Wujek Coal Mine]]. The [[Milicja Obywatelska|Special Platoon of the Motorized Reserves of the Citizens' Militia]] (''ZOMO'') was responsible for the brutal handling of strikers protesting against [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]]'s declaration of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law]] and the arrest of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity trade union]] officials. On the 10th anniversary of the event, a memorial was unveiled by the President of Poland [[Lech Wałęsa]].

In 1990, the first democratic local elections that took place marked a new period in the city's history. The economy of Katowice has been transforming from the heavy industry of steel and coal mines into "one of the most attractive investment areas for modern economy branches in Central Europe".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silesia-online.com/89,Stalinogrod_-_Post-War_History_.htm|title=Katowice Online – Stalinogrod – Post-War History of Katowice|first=Wirtualny Turysta|last=www.wirtualnyturysta.com|access-date=15 March 2017|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316113211/http://www.silesia-online.com/89,Stalinogrod_-_Post-War_History_.htm|archive-date=16 March 2017}}</ref> 

===21st century===

Recently, the city's efficient infrastructure, rapid progress in the overall development and an increase in office space has made Katowice a popular venue for conducting business. The Katowice Expo Centre (''Katowickie Centrum Wystawiennicze'') organises trade fairs or exhibitions and attracts investors from all over the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.poland.travel/en-gb/cities/katowice-the-capital-city-of-upper-silesia|title=Katowice – the capital city of Upper Silesia|first=Agata|last=Witosławska|access-date=15 March 2017|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828191708/https://www.poland.travel/en-gb/cities/katowice-the-capital-city-of-upper-silesia|archive-date=28 August 2017}}</ref> In 2018, the city was the host of the 24th Session of the Conference of the Parties to the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC [[2018 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP24]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cop24.gov.pl/|title=COP24|website=cop24.gov.pl|archive-date=28 April 2018|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180428180844/http://www.cop24.gov.pl/|access-date=2 July 2022}}</ref> In 2022, the city hosted the 11th edition of the [[World Urban Forum]], the world's most important conference on sustainable urbanization and development of cities.<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.ifla.org/events/world-urban-forum-2022/ |title=World Urban Forum 2022 |access-date=2 July 2022}}</ref>

===Neighborhoods===
[[File:Katowice jednostki pomocnicze.png|right|300px|Map of Katowice, showing its 5 districts and 22 neighbourhoods.]]Katowice has 22 officially recognized neighborhoods. [[Śródmieście, Katowice|Śródmieście]], [[Osiedle Paderewskiego-Muchowiec]], [[Zawodzie, Katowice|Zawodzie]] and [[Koszutka]] form the dense central urban core where most cultural and educational institutions, businesses and administrative buildings are located.

Most Northern and Eastern neighborhoods around the downtown core are more working-class and developed from worker's estates build around large industry such as coal mines, manufactures and steelworks. Each of these neighborhoods has its own dense commercial strip surrounded by mid-rise apartment buildings and some single-family homes. [[Szopienice-Burowiec|Szopienice]], located between downtown Katowice and Mysłowice, used to be a separate town until mid-1960s. [[Nikiszowiec]], a former mine's town, has undergone strong [[gentrification]] in recent years, and emerged as a major tourist attraction in the region thanks to its unique architecture and art galleries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nikiszowiec |url=https://www.inyourpocket.com/katowice/Nikiszowiec-and-Giszowiec_71613f |access-date=2022-08-08 |website=www.inyourpocket.com |language=en}}</ref>

Western and Southern neighborhoods (with the exception of Brynów-Załęska Hałda, which is a working-class neighborhood built around a coal mine) are more suburban in nature, concentrating the city's middle and upper middle classes.

===Metropolitan area===
Katowice lies in the centre of [[Katowice urban area|the largest conurbation]] in Poland, [[List of urban areas in the European Union|one of the largest in the European Union]], numbering about 2.7&nbsp;million. The [[Katowice metropolitan area]] consists of about 40 adjacent cities and towns, the whole [[Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area]] (mostly within the [[Upper Silesian Coal Basin]]) over 50 cities or towns and a population of 5,008,000. In 2006, Katowice and 14 adjacent cities united as the Metropolitan Association of Upper Silesia (predecessor to the current [[Metropolis GZM]]). Its population was 2 million and its area was 1,104&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>. In 2006–2007 the union planned to unite these cities in one city under the name "Silesia", but this proved unsuccessful.<ref>{{in lang|pl}} [http://www.dziennik.pl/Default.aspx?TabId=14&ShowArticleId=24596 dziennik.pl – "17 śląskich miast chce się połączyć w Silesię", 11 December 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930031513/http://www.dziennik.pl/Default.aspx?TabId=14&ShowArticleId=24596 |date=30 September 2007 }}</ref>

The inhabitants of a large mining community like Katowice, and local administrations within the conurbation, which have only evolved due to mining, are a subject to overall decline after the liquidation of coal mines and factories. This is one of the reasons which led to the development of the service sector, including office spaces, shopping centres and tourism.

Age breakdown of people in Katowice is: 12.9% 0–14 years old, 13.7% 15–29 years old, 23.8% 30–44 years old, 19.5% 45–59 years old, 20.1% 60–74 years old, and 9.9% 75 years and older.

Katowice is a centre of the [[Katowice-Ostrava metropolitan area]], with a population of approx. 5.3 million. This metropolitan area extends into the neighboring [[Czech Republic|Czechia]], where the other centre is the city of [[Ostrava]]. 41 municipalities that constitute the core of the metropolitan area created the [[Metropolis GZM]] association, which has 2.3 million people {{as of|2019|lc=y|post=.}}

===Historical population===
Katowice's population grew very fast between 1845 and 1960, fueled by the expansion of heavy industry and administrative functions. In the 60s, 70s and 80s, the city grew by another 100,000 people, reaching a height of 368,621 in 1988. Since then, the decline of heavy industry, emigration, and [[suburbanization]] reversed the population development; Katowice lost approx. 75,000 people (20%) since the fall of communism in Poland.

Before World War II, Katowice was mainly inhabited by Poles and Germans. The 1905 Silesian demographic census has shown that Germans made up nearly 70–75% of the total population (including German Jews) and Poles constituted 25–30% of inhabitants of Katowice. After the plebiscite in Upper Silesia, [[Silesian uprisings]] and the incorporation of Katowice into Poland in 1922, and then the incorporation of several nearby villages and towns into the city, the number of inhabitants of Katowice increased significantly, but the number of Germans in Katowice fell to 12% in 1925 and to 6% in 1939 (most Germans left Poland, many ethnic Silesians who used to identify as Germans switched their identification to Poles, and areas with a Polish majority were incorporated). Thus, in 1939 the ethnic breakdown of the city was: 93% Poles, 6% Germans, and 1% Jews.

After the German aggression against Poland in 1939, some Poles were [[Expulsion of Poles by Nazi Germany|displaced]] from Katowice and Germans were settled in their place. In 1945, practically the entire German minority has either left fleeing the Red Army or was forced to leave after Poland regained control of the city, and Polish exiles from [[Kresy]] (''Eastern Borderlands'') and Polish people from other regions (including for work purposes) started to come to settle in the city. 

During the war, the Nazi occupiers committed severe crimes against the local [[Holocaust|Roma and Jewish communities]], either killing them on the spot or transporting them to [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] such as [[Auschwitz]] for complete extermination.<ref>{{cite web|title=Holocaust – oshpitzin.pl|url=http://oshpitzin.pl/holocaust/|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170316210702/http://oshpitzin.pl/holocaust/|archive-date=16 March 2017|access-date=16 March 2017}}</ref> This led to a population drop between 1939 and 1945.

===Ethnic diversity===
Katowice is one of the more diverse cities in Poland. In the 2021 census, 93.87% of inhabitants declared a Polish nationality while 19.38% declared a nationality other than Polish (in the Polish census, respondents are allowed to declare up to two nationalities or ethnicities). Indigenous Silesians were the largest minority, at 17.8%, followed by Germans (0.43%), Ukrainians (0.18%), the English (0.12%), Jews (0.07%) and Italians (0.07%).<ref>{{Cite web |last=GUS |title=Tablice z ostatecznymi danymi w zakresie przynależności narodowo-etnicznej, języka używanego w domu oraz przynależności do wyznania religijnego |url=https://stat.gov.pl/spisy-powszechne/nsp-2021/nsp-2021-wyniki-ostateczne/tablice-z-ostatecznymi-danymi-w-zakresie-przynaleznosci-narodowo-etnicznej-jezyka-uzywanego-w-domu-oraz-przynaleznosci-do-wyznania-religijnego,10,1.html |access-date=2024-03-02 |website=stat.gov.pl |language=pl}}</ref>

===Socioeconomics===
According to the 2021 census, 32.3% of the population aged 13 and older had a college degree, 34.3% had a high school diploma or some college, 17.9% completed a vocational secondary school, 2.4% only completed a gimnazjum, 8.4% only completed a primary school while 2.1% did not complete primary school. In 2011, in the 25–34 age group, college graduates share is 44.9%, and an additional 31.8% has a high school degree. According to [[Eurostat]] data, Katowice and its surrounding [[Silesian Voivodeship|Silesian region]] had one of the highest share of people who have attained at least an upper secondary level of education (more than 90%), and one of the lowest share of school dropouts in Europe (less than 5%).<ref>{{Cite web|title=Education and training statistics at regional level – Statistics Explained|url=https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Education_and_training_statistics_at_regional_level#Educational_attainment|access-date=2021-02-06|website=ec.europa.eu}}</ref>

There were 120,869 households in Katowice as of the 2021 census, a drop from 134,199 in the 2011 census.

No other denomination had at least 1,000 followers as of the 2021 census. In the 2011 census, denominations with at least 1,000 worshippers included the [[Evangelical Church of the Augsburg Confession in Poland|Lutheran Church in Poland]] – 0.43% (1,336 people) and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] – 0.42% (1,311 people).

The [[Cathedral of Christ the King, Katowice|Cathedral of Christ the King]], constructed between 1927 and 1955 in a classicist style, is the largest cathedral in Poland. There are 36 [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Church (building)|churches]] in Katowice (including two [[Basilicas in the Catholic Church|basilicas]]), as well as 18 [[Monastery|monasteries]]. Katowice is also a seat of a diocesan Catholic seminary, as well as one of the [[Order of Friars Minor]]. Katowice Archdiocese owns several media companies headquartered in Katowice: ''Księgarnia św. Jacka'', a Catholic publishing company, and ''Instytut Gość Media'', a multi-channeled media company that owns ''Radio eM'', a regional Catholic radio, and a few magazines. [[Gość Niedzielny]], owned by ''Instytut Gość Media'' and published in Katowice, is currently the most-popular Catholic magazine in the country with approx. 120,000 copies sold weekly.
[[File:Katowice - Kościół ewangelicko-augsburski - front.JPG|thumb|Lutheran Cathedral of the Resurrection ]]
Katowice is also the seat of a [[Lutheran Diocese of Katowice|Lutheran Diocese]] which covers [[Upper Silesia]], [[Lesser Poland]] and [[Podkarpackie Voivodeship|Subcarpathian region]] and has 12,934 adherents {{as of|2019|lc=y|post=.}}<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|title=Rocznik Statystyczny Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej|journal=Rocznik Statystyczny Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej = Statistical Yearbook of the Republic of Poland|publisher=Zakład Wydawnictw Statystycznych|year=2020|issn=1506-0632|location=Warszawa|pages=202}}</ref> Lutherans have two churches in Katowice, including a cathedral, which is the oldest church built originally in Katowice, completed on 29 September 1858.

Other denominations with churches or praying houses in Katowice include [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh Day Adventists]], [[Baptists]], Christ Church in Poland, [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] and other [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] groups.

====Judaism====
[[File:Katowice Synagoge.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Great Synagogue, Katowice|Great Synagogue]] was destroyed by the [[Nazi Germany|German Nazis]] during the [[invasion of Poland]] on 4 September 1939]]

Dr. Jacob Cohn was the first [[rabbi]] of Katowice, appointed to this function on 6 January 1872 and holding it until 1920s. [[Zionism]] was strong in Katowice, and in 1884 the city was the place of the [[Katowice Conference]], the first public Zionist meeting in history. On 12 September 1900, the [[Great Synagogue (Katowice)|Great Synagogue]] was opened.

Following World War I and subsequent creation of the [[Second Polish Republic|Polish state]], most Katowice Jews, who identified with Germany, left the city and settled primarily in [[Bytom]], a nearby city that was still part of Germany. They were partially replaced by Jews moving from the East, particularly the neighboring [[Dąbrowa Basin]] region that had a large Jewish population. In 1931, 60% of 5,716 Jews in Katowice were recent immigrants from other parts of Poland.<ref name="sztetl.org.pl"/> On 1 September 1939, Poland was attacked by [[Nazi Germany]], and Katowice, a border city, surrendered on 3 September. The Great Synagogue was burned by the German army the same day, and in the following months, Katowice Jews were deported to [[Nazi ghettos|ghettos]] in Dąbrowa Basin (primarily [[Sosnowiec Ghetto|Sosnowiec]] and [[Będzin Ghetto|Będzin]]) or directly to various [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration]] and [[Extermination camp|death camps]] where most of them were murdered in [[the Holocaust]]. After the war, around 1,500 Jews were living in Katowice, but most of them left Poland and emigrated to the [[United States]] and other Western countries.

Currently, Katowice has one [[Qahal]] with approximately 200 members. It owns houses of prayer in Katowice (along with a [[Kosher foods|kosher]] cafeteria) and nearby Gliwice, and the current rabbi is Yehoshua Ellis.

====Other religions====
There are two buddhist groups in Katowice: [[Kwan Um School of Zen]], first registered in 1982, and the Diamond Road of Karma Kagyu line association. Jehovah's Witnesses maintain 13 houses of prayer and one [[Kingdom Hall]] in Katowice. Aside from Polish-language congregations, there is one for [[English language|English]] speakers and one for [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] speakers.

Unlike most other large Polish cities, Katowice did not originate as a medieval town, therefore it does not have an old town with a street layout and architectural styles characteristic to cities founded on [[Magdeburg rights]]. Katowice's urban layout is a result of expansion and annexation of various towns, industrial worker estates, and villages.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Szczypka-Gwiazda|first=Barbara|title=Urbanistyka, architektura, sztuka i nurty życia artystycznego.

In 1922, Katowice and the eastern portion of Upper Silesia were reintegrated with reborn Poland, and an [[Silesian Voivodeship (1920–1939)|autonomous Silesian Voivodeship]] was established, with Katowice as its capital. This event has marked the beginning of a period of unprecedented architectural development in the city. Since most traditional styles, especially [[Gothic architecture|gothic]] and gothic revival, were perceived as connected to imperial Germany by the new Polish authorities, all new development was to be built in, at first in the [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]], and later in [[Functionalism (architecture)|functionalist]]/[[Bauhaus]] style.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Syska|first1=Anna|title=Styl gotycki wyklucza się.

The modernist district is centered around the monumental [[Silesian Parliament]] building (1923–1929), which architecture is mostly functionalist but still will neoclassical references on the facades. During World War II, the building became headquarters of the [[Province of Upper Silesia|Reichsgau Oberschlesien]] and part of the interior was redesigned by [[Albert Speer]], [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler's]] favorite architect, to resemble the interior of the [[Reich Chancellery]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Sejm Śląski, czyli budynek Śląskiego Urzędu Wojewódzkiego w Katowicach – monumentalne arcydzieło modernizmu – Bryła|url=https://www.bryla.pl/bryla/1,85301,6677160,BRYLAnty_polskiej_moderny___parlament_w____Katowicach.html|access-date=2021-02-12|website=www.bryla.pl|language=pl}}</ref> The nearby [[Cathedral of Christ the King, Katowice|Cathedral of Christ the King]] (1927–1955, with dome lowered by 34 meters compared to original design) is also neoclassical but with an ascetic interior (including a [[tabernacle]] and a golden mosaic funded by future pope, [[Pope Benedict XVI|Joseph Ratzinger]]).<ref>{{Cite web|last=Wieliński|first=Bartosz T.|date=2019-02-11|title=Zmienił projekt katedry na życzenie komunistów, ale świątynia i tak na tym zyskała|url=https://katowice.wyborcza.pl/katowice/7,165672,24447287,zmienil-projekt-katedry-na-zyczenie-komunistow-ale-swiatynia.html?disableRedirects=true|access-date=2021-02-12|website=katowice.wyborcza.pl}}</ref> Other buildings, designed in mid-to-late 1920s and 1930s, are mostly modernist or functionalist.

Following the death of Stalin in 1956, and the end of socrealism, Jerzy Ziętek and city authorities commissioned a group of young architects and urbanists to create a project of the new urban design of Katowice. The collective, called ''Miastoprojekt Katowice'', came up with a design heavily influenced by [[Le Corbusier's Five Points of Architecture|Le Corbusier's]] ideas.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Step-by-Step Guide to the Best of Katowice|url=https://culture.pl/en/article/step-by-step-guide-to-the-best-of-katowice|access-date=2021-02-12|website=Culture.pl|language=en}}</ref> The project was centered around a grand avenue (current ''Aleja Korfantego'') surrounded by simple, modern blocks and monuments, scattered in distance to each other according to modernist ideals.

Following the collapse of communism in Poland and other Eastern Bloc countries, and the centrally-planned economy with it, Katowice's economy suffered a downturn, due to reduced significance of heavy industry. As a result, except for residential (primarily suburban) construction, not many buildings were built. One of the most significant buildings of the 1990s was the new branch of the [[Silesian Library]], in postmodernism style.

The situation changed in the early aughts, when several new notable developments were completed:

* Chorzowska 50 (1999–2001) – first modern, A-grade office building in Katowice; currently owned and occupied by [[ING Bank Śląski]] 
* [[Altus Skyscraper|Altus]], previously known as Uni Centrum (2001–2003) – for many years the highest skyscraper in Poland outside of Warsaw, at 125 meters (410&nbsp;ft) high. Qubus Hotel, which was located in Altus, was one of the first four-star hotels in southern Poland.
* [[Silesia City Center]] (2003–2005), the flagship brownfield development of the era, built in place a defunct coal mine Gottwald. It remains one of the largest shopping centres in Poland, at {{cvt|86,000|m2}}, and also includes a housing estate and a chapel.
* Dom z Ziemi Śląskiej (2001–2002), a modern suburban villa, nominated to [[European Union Prize for Contemporary Architecture|Mies van der Rohe Award]] in 2002

Another wave of architectural revival came after Poland joined the [[European Union]] in 2004. European [[Structural Funds and Cohesion Fund|cohesion funds]], along with private capital investment, flew into the city resulting in a number of architecturally interesting buildings and complexes, including:

* Strefa Kultury (Zone of Culture, a brownfield urban redevelopment in downtown Katowice): 
** [[Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra|National Polish Radio Symphony Orchestra (NOSPR) building]] (2012–2014) contains two concert halls (for an audience of 1,800 or 300).

Katowice is also the seat of Katowice [[Special Economic Zone]] (Katowicka Specjalna Strefa Ekonomiczna).

=== Industry ===
Since its creation, Katowice's development was tightly connected to heavy industry, especially coal mining, steelworks and machine production. In 1931, 49.5% of inhabitants worked in industry, and 12.5% in coal mining alone. In 1989 industry accounted for 36% of all jobs in the city (112,000 employees). As of 2018, 34,294 people worked in industry in Katowice, 20.4% of total, below the national average.

The first reported coal mine in Katowice (''Murcki'' coal mine) was established in 1740, and in 1769 construction on ''Emanuelssegen'' mine started. As the demand for coal kept rising in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], further mines were opened: ''Beata'' (1801), ''Ferdinand'' (1823), ''Kleofas'' (1845). Later in 19th and early 20th century additional mines were opened: ''Katowice'', ''Wujek'', ''Eminenz'' (later renamed ''Gottwald'' and merged with ''Kleofas''), ''Wieczorek'', ''Boże Dary'', ''Staszic'' and renewed ''Murcki''. Currently only one (''Murcki-Staszic'') remains in operation. Katowice is also the seat of [[:pl:Polska Grupa Górnicza|Polska Grupa Górnicza]], the largest coal mining corporation in Europe. Metallurgy was another important part of Katowice's economy. In 1863 a dozen zinc metallurgy facilities were reported in Katowice, with ''Wilhelmina'' (founded in 1834) being the largest. In early 1900s, ''Wilhelmina'' (later renamed ''Huta Metali Niezależnych Szopienice'') was enlarged and became the largest Silesian producer of [[non-ferrous metal]]s and world's largest producer of [[cadmium]]. Two major steelworks existed in the city: ''Huta Baildon'', established in 1823 by the Scottish engineer and industrialist [[John Baildon]] (declared bankruptcy in 2001), and ''[[FERRUM SA|Huta Ferrum]]'', established in 1874 and operating to this date in limited capacity.

Vibrant and progressive artistic communities, particularly around musical arts, make Katowice one of the leading cultural spots in Poland.<ref name="auto2">{{cite web|url=http://en.invest.katowice.eu/people/27/culture.html|title=Culture: People: Invest in Katowice.|first=Media Partner Sp.|last=j.|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325024546/http://en.invest.katowice.eu/people/27/culture.html|archive-date=25 March 2017}}</ref> Since mid-2000s, Katowice has established a strategy to redevelop the post-industrial areas using culture – the pinnacle of which was a massive development on the site of a former coal mine known as [[:pl:Strefa Kultury (Katowice)|Strefa Kultury]] (the "Zone of Culture"), where numerous cultural and convention institutions are located.

Katowice's status as the UNESCO [[City of Music (UNESCO)|City of Music]], designated when Katowice joined [[UNESCO]] [[Creative Cities Network]] in 2015,<ref>{{cite news |title=Katowice – a city of music |url=https://www.polska.pl/arts/music/katowice-city-music/ |url-status=live |access-date=31 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180801004215/https://www.polska.pl/arts/music/katowice-city-music/ |archive-date=1 August 2018}}</ref> comes from a long and rich history of musical arts. Katowice is the seat of an internationally renowned [[Karol Szymanowski Academy of Music]], whose faculty and graduates created the nationally important informal group called the Silesian school of composers. [[Polish National Radio Symphony Orchestra]] has been located in Katowice since 1945 and has gotten a new internationally acclaimed concert hall in 2014, built on a site of a former coal mine near Katowice's city center. The [[Silesian Philharmonic]] also has its seat in Katowice. The city is a venue for numerous classical concerts and festivals, such as: the International Festival of Young Music Competition Laureates, [[Grzegorz Fitelberg International Competition for Conductors]], Chamber Music Festival, Ars Cameralis Festival and Katowice's opera, operettas and most of all ballet.

There are currently 6 theater buildings in Katowice, and some theater groups without a permanent location. [[Silesian Theatre|Teatr Śląski]] is the oldest still-functioning theater in Katowice, first opened for audience in 1907 and located on the main square. It was the first theater to give plays in [[Silesian language|Silesian dialect]] of Polish. Every first Monday of the month, the [[Silesian Opera]] singers from nearby [[Bytom]] give a performance there, as Katowice does not have an opera house of its own. Teatr Ateneum is an important puppetry theater, while Teatr Korez was one of the first non-public theaters in post-war Poland.

Katowice is home to many nationally and internationally renowned popular music festivals. [[Rawa Blues Festival|Rawa Blues]], named after a stream that passes through Katowice's city center, is one of the largest blues festivals in Europe. Electronic music's [[Mayday (music festival)|Mayday Festival]] takes place every year in early November and is a sister event to its namesake in [[Dortmund]]. [[Off Festival|OFF Festival]], dedicated to alternative music, moved to Katowice in 2010 and has been held every August. Tauron Nowa Muzyka festival, oriented more towards dance and techno has been named one of the major European festivals to attend.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Festival Tauron Nowa Muzyka |url=https://crackmagazine.net/article/live-reviews/tauron-nowa-muzkya/ |access-date=2022-08-03 |website=Crack Magazine}}</ref> Other music festivals, such as the Silesian Jazz Festival, KatoHej (dedicated to chants and touristic music), and Gardens of Sound, are also organized. In 2019, 475,806 people attended various big cultural events such as concerts and festivals, which gave the city the third place in Poland, behind Warsaw and Kraków. Nearby [[Chorzów]], with the [[Stadion Śląski|Silesian Stadium]] right across the street from Katowice, gathered another 319,783 attendees.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 4, 2022 |title=Kultura – Organizacja imprez masowych – Liczba uczestników imprez. |url=https://bdl.stat.gov.pl/bdl/dane/podgrup/tablica |website=Bank Danych Lokalnych}}</ref>

[[File:At Katowice 2024 240.jpg|thumb|Old building of Silesian Museum]]
The [[Silesian Museum]] is the largest and most-important museum in Katowice. It originally opened in 1929, and its radically modern, [[Bauhaus]]-style new building was demolished immediately after the Nazis seized Katowice in 1939, considering it too degenerate and too Polish. The museum has been placed in temporary buildings with its collections dispersed until 2015, when a new, mostly underground building has been constructed in the Zone of Culture. The museum exhibits works by famous and renowned Polish artists like [[Józef Chełmoński]], [[Artur Grottger]], [[Tadeusz Makowski]], [[Jacek Malczewski]], [[Jan Matejko]], [[Józef Mehoffer]] and [[Stanisław Wyspiański]].<ref name="auto2" /> It is also well known for its collection of [[naïve art]] paintings, including local coal miners from Katowice area. The museum has a number of sketches of globally recognizable artists such as [[Albrecht Dürer]] and [[Rembrandt]].

The City History Museum of Katowice exhibitions include: immersive typical urban apartments from early 20th century, [[naïve art]] paintings from local artists and the history of Katowice from a village to an industrial center. Other museums in Katowice include Museum of the History of Computers and Informatics and the Museum of Smallest Books in the World.

The BWA Contemporary Art Gallery in Katowice, established in 1949, is a notable institution concerning the [[Contemporary art]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://culture.pl/pl/miejsce/galeria-sztuki-wspolczesnej-bwa-w-katowicach|title=Galeria Sztuki Współczesnej BWA w Katowicach – Miejsce – Culture.pl|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170325024529/http://culture.pl/pl/miejsce/galeria-sztuki-wspolczesnej-bwa-w-katowicach|archive-date=25 March 2017}}</ref> Every three years, it is responsible for organizing the Polish Graphic Art Triennial.

===Freeways, roads and streets===
[[File:Katowice - ul. W. Roździeńskiego (Novotel i Gwiazdy).JPG|thumb|Drogowa Trasa Średnicowa (DK79) exiting the tunnel below Katowice city center]]
Katowice has an extensive network of freeways, roads and streets, totaling over 1,120&nbsp;km in length.<ref>{{Cite web |title=MSZ-KIIP Miejski System Zarządzania – Katowicka Infrastruktura Informacji Przestrzennej – Mapa akustyczna |url=https://emapa.katowice.eu/mszkiip/geoportal-obslugi-obywatela/mapa-akustyczna?start=3 |access-date=2022-08-03 |website=emapa.katowice.eu}}</ref> The well-developed network supports over 200,000 cars registered in Katowice, and 49 percent of commuters that drive alone, a high share compared to other major cities in Poland.<ref name=":2" /> Several freeways in Katowice are among the busiest in Poland: [[Expressway S86 (Poland)|expressway S86]] between [[Sosnowiec]] and Katowice's city center and [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|highway A4]] between Murckowska and Mikołowska interchanges both see over 100,000 cars passing each day.

Katowice has a ring around its city center, consisting of highway A4, Murckowska freeway, [[Drogowa Trasa Średnicowa]] (a freeway-style road connecting downtowns of cities in the Katowice urban area) that partly goes in a tunnel underground and Bocheńskiego road. Many of the roads and freeways in Katowice expand radially from the city center and replaced old local roads.

==== Main roads ====
[[European route E40]] passes through Katowice as [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|highway A4]]. It enters the city from Chorzów and continues eastward, with three lanes in each direction on the main road and two to three lanes in parallel access roads. It meets Bocheńskiego road and continues towards Mikołowska interchange, which is one of the only [[Interchange (road)|combination interchanges]] in Poland and the main exit towards the city center. After that interchange, the highway loses its access roads due to lack of space in the dense urban area and continues east with four lanes in each direction. Access roads appear again (only on the south side, though) after around 500 meters and there is an exit towards Francuska Street. After another 1.5 kilometer, access roads appear again on the north side, too, and there is a tight exit towards Pułaskiego Street. The highway then runs into Murckowska interchange, before exiting the city.

[[National roads in Poland#List of national roads|National road 79]] (DK79) enters Katowice from [[Chorzów]] and separates the [[Silesian Park]] and [[Osiedle Tysiąclecia]] in Katowice. It then merges with Drogowa Trasa Średnicowa (DTŚ) at the junction with Bocheńskiego road and Złota Street. It continues with DTŚ through the Katowice city center and descents into a tunnel under the Rondo roundabout. It then emerges overground again, right before an interchange with DK86. The road continues eastward as a freeway with exits towards [[Zawodzie, Katowice|Zawodzie]] and [[Szopienice-Burowiec|Szopienice]] neighborhoods for several more kilometers, before entering [[Mysłowice]] and becoming a standard-access road.

[[National roads in Poland#List of national roads|National road 81]] (DK81) enters Katowice from [[Mikołów]] and runs through the southern residential neighborhoods as an arterial road with two lanes in each direction, named [[Tadeusz Kościuszko|Kościuszki]] Street. In the Brynów neighborhood, Kościuszki Street continues towards Katowice's city center while NR 81 turns east, to run through the forest towards the interchange with DK86.

[[National roads in Poland#List of national roads|National road 86]] (DK86) enters Katowice from [[Sosnowiec]] as expressway S86 up until Roździeńskiego interchange where it meets DK79 and loses its expressway status. It then continues south as Murckowska freeway east of the city center. It meets highway A4 and then passes by [[Giszowiec]] neighborhood and continues through the woods southward, with exits towards [[Murcki]] neighborhood (from which it gets its name) and [[Kostuchna]]. It bypasses Murcki from the east and continues south towards [[Tychy]].

==== Tempo 30 Zone ====
In 2015, Katowice designated most of its city center as a {{Convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=in}} zone, in an effort to curb traffic fatalities and crashes. Within 3 years of operation, the number of accidents dropped by 41 percent, including 37 percent drop in accidents involving pedestrians and cyclists. The accidents are also less severe: there was a 55 percent drop in injured pedestrians and cyclists.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Strefa tempo 30 |url=https://katowice.eu/dla-mieszka%C5%84ca/transport-w-mie%C5%9Bcie/strefa-tempo-30 |access-date=2022-08-03 |website=katowice.eu}}</ref>
