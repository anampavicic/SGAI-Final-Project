'''West Valley City''' is a city in [[Salt Lake County, Utah|Salt Lake County]] and a suburb of [[Salt Lake City]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Utah]]. The population was 140,230 at the [[2020 United States Census|2020 census]],<ref name="quickfacts"/>
making it the [[List of cities and towns in Utah|second-most populous city in Utah]] after Salt Lake City. The city incorporated in 1980 from a large, quickly growing unincorporated area, combining the four communities of Granger, Hunter, Chesterfield, and Redwood. It is home to the [[Maverik Center]] and [[Utah First Credit Union Amphitheatre]].

==History==
The earliest known residents of the western Salt Lake Valley were [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] bands of the [[Ute people|Ute]] and [[Shoshoni]] tribes.

The first European people to live in the area were the Latter-day Saints. The Euro-Americans arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847. The area was first staked out by settler Joseph Harker and his family in the area they named as "over Jordan" (referring to the land west of the [[Jordan River (Utah)|Jordan River]], which runs through the valley).

The Granger area was settled by Welsh pioneers who came to Utah with [[Dan Jones (Mormon)|Dan Jones]] in 1849. Irrigation systems and agriculture were developed in the area, and [[Elias Smith (Mormon)|Elias Smith]] proposed the area's name on account of its successful farming. The population of Granger and its vicinity was about 1,000 people in 1930.<ref>Jenson, Andrew. ''Encyclopedic History of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints''. (Salt Lake City: Deseret News Press, 1941) p. 295</ref>

Hunter was not settled until 1876. This settlement was started by Rasmus Nielson, Edward Rushton, August Larsen and about seven others along with their families. Irrigation began in 1881 and the main crop was fruit trees.<ref>Jenson. ''Encyclopedic History''. p. 346</ref>

The city began to experience rapid growth in the 1970s, when the area that is now West Valley City consisted of the four separate communities of Hunter, Granger, Chesterfield, and Redwood. These four [[unincorporated area]]s merged in 1980 to form the present-day city. During the [[2002 Olympic Winter Games]], West Valley City was the official venue for men's and women's [[ice hockey]].

On May 19, 2011, the city unveiled an official plan to create a downtown area for the city over the course of 10 years, building on plans and development that already existed. It will be known as Fairbourne Station (named after Joseph Fairbourne, an early settler who operated a weigh station in the area in the late 19th century) and will consist of approximately {{convert|40|acres|0|abbr=on}}, costing $500 million to build. The center will include a civic center (consisting of city hall, a courthouse, police headquarters, and a library), an eight-story [[Embassy Suites Hotels|Embassy Suites]] hotel, a plaza, and residential development, as well as the end of the [[TRAX (light rail)|TRAX]] [[Green Line (TRAX)|Green Line]], and a stop on the [[3500 South MAX]] [[bus rapid transit]] line. [[Valley Fair Mall (West Valley City, Utah)|Valley Fair Mall]] and the [[Maverik Center]] are located nearby, as is [[Interstate 215 (Utah)|I-215]]. {{As of|2016}},  the development is incomplete with the TRAX line having opened in 2011 and the hotel in 2012, but the City Hall and the government center still under construction.<ref>[http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/51831965-78/west-valley-fairbourne-south.html.csp New name for WVC project: Fairbourne Station].

Serial killer [[Ted Bundy]] was arrested in Granger on August 16, 1975, on a routine traffic stop.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/778245/Officer-recalls-Bundys-75-capture.html|title=Officer recalls Bundy's '75 capture|date=2000-08-20|work=DeseretNews.com|access-date=2017-04-21|language=en}}</ref>

==Geography==
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 35.5&nbsp;square miles (91.8&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>), of which 35.4&nbsp;square miles (91.7&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) is land and 0.1&nbsp;square miles (0.2&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) (0.17%) is water.

West Valley is located on the northwest side of the [[Salt Lake Valley]] between [[Salt Lake City]] on the north, [[South Salt Lake, Utah|South Salt Lake]] on the east, [[Magna, Utah|Magna]] on the west, and [[Taylorsville, Utah|Taylorsville]] and [[Kearns, Utah|Kearns Township]] on the south.

West Valley City has a [[Non-partisan democracy|nonpartisan]], strong city manager form of government, which means that the city manager is analogous to a corporation's CEO, while the [[mayor]] fills a role similar to chairman of the board, with the City Council acting as the "board". The [[mayor]] is a voting member of the City Council. The West Valley City Council meets each Tuesday night at 6:30 PM, except fifth Tuesdays. City Hall is located at 3600 South Constitution Boulevard.

==Government==
The [[mayor]] and six [[councilor]]s are elected to four-year terms. Mayoral elections are held the same year as three of the councilors. The other three councilors are staggered two years from the mayoral. Two council seats are at-large, or citywide, and the remaining four seats represent districts of approximately 28,000 residents. Officials are not subject to [[term limit]]s. {{as of|2013|November}}, the most recent election was held in November, 2013.<ref>{{cite news|last=Manson|first=Pamela|title=Bigelow wins West Valley City mayor's race by large margin|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/57082920-90/bigelow-com-http-lang.html.csp|access-date=19 November 2013|newspaper=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=5 November 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, the city police's narcotics unit was disbanded after an officer-involved critical incident revealed drugs and money had not been booked into evidence. Officers in the unit were also found to be keeping change and small items from seized vehicles, and placing tracking devices on potential suspects' vehicles without warrants.<ref>{{cite news|author=Jack Healy|title=A 'Pandora's Box of Problems' From a Police Shooting and Drugs in a Utah Town|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 17, 2013|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/us/drug-cases-put-utah-towns-police-force-under-scrutiny.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0|access-date=2017-08-27}}</ref>
