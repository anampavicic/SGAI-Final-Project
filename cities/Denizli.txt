'''Denizli''' is a city in [[Aegean Region|Aegean]] [[Turkey]], and seat of the province of [[Denizli Province|Denizli]]. The city forms the urban part of the districts [[Merkezefendi]] and [[Pamukkale, Denizli|Pamukkale]], with a population of 651,200 in 2022.<ref name=citypop/>

Denizli has seen economic development in the last few decades, mostly due to textile production and exports.<ref>{{cite book |title=Regional Economic Growth, SMEs and the Wider Europe, Chapter 11: The changing role of SMEs in the regional growth process: The case of Denizli |author1=Bernard Fingleton |author2=Ayda Eraydın |author3=Raffaele Paci |author4=Bilge Armatlı Köroğlu |author5=Burak Beyhan |page=229 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |year=2003 |isbn=0-7546-3613-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wz.uni.lodz.pl/ersa/abstr/ozgur_p.pdf |title=Integration of a Local Economy to the Global and European Markets through Export–Led Growth and Specialized Textile Products Export: Home Textile Production in Denizli – Turkey |author=Hüseyin Özgür, [[Pamukkale University]] |publisher=[[University of Łódź]] |access-date=2007-04-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070630115910/http://wz.uni.lodz.pl/ersa/abstr/ozgur_p.pdf |archive-date=2007-06-30 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

Denizli also attracts visitors to the nearby mineral-coated hillside hot spring of [[Pamukkale]], and with red color thermal water spa hotels [[Karahayıt]], just {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=off}} north of Pamukkale. Recently, Denizli became a major domestic tourism destination due to the various types of thermal waters in [[Sarayköy]], Central/Denizli (where Karahayıt and Pamukkale towns are located), [[Akköy, Denizli|Akköy]] (Gölemezli), [[Buldan]] (Yenicekent), and Çardak districts.

The ancient ruined city of [[Hierapolis]], as well as ruins of the city of [[Laodicea on the Lycus]], the ancient metropolis of [[Phrygia]], are nearby. Also in the vicinity of [[Honaz]], about {{cvt|10|mi|0}} west of Denizli is, what was, in the 1st century AD, the city of [[Colossae]].

The weather is hot in Denizli in summers, whereas in winters, it may occasionally be very cold with snow on the mountains that surround the city. Some years, snow can be observed in the urban areas. Springs and autumns are rainy, with a mild warm climate.

==Name==
The word ''[[wikt:Special:Search/deniz|deniz]]'' means 'sea, large lake'. No sea or lake can be found near Denizli. However, the original Turkish name for the place was ''Tonguzlu'', pronounced as ''toŋuzlu'' or ''doŋuzlu'', later ''donuzlu'' (from ''[[wikt:Special:Search/Reconstruction:Proto-Turkic/toŋuz|toŋuz]]'' '[[wild boar]]'). Thus Tonguzlu means a 'place where boars dwell'. Because of the phonetical process (t->d, ŋ->n), the name was changed into ''denizlü'' or ''denizli'', similar in pronunciation but different in meaning, in order to avoid the connotation 'boar, pig', which is considered [[Religious restrictions on the consumption of pork#Prohibition in Islamic law|offensive in Islam]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Byzantium and the Turks in the Thirteenth Century |author=Dimitri Korobeinikov |page=223 |year=2014}}</ref> [[Ibn Battuta]] recorded that the city was called ''Dun Ghuzluh''. The latter is said to mean 'the town of the swine'.<ref>{{cite book |author=Colin J. Hemer |year=1987 |page=277 |title=Letters to the Seven Churches of Asia In their Local Setting}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Pamukkale_30.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pamukkale]] is a main tourism attraction in Denizli.]]
[[File:TR Pamukkale Laodicea asv2020-02 img11.jpg|thumb|left|Archaeological site of [[Laodicea on the Lycus]] between [[Pamukkale]] and Denizli, Turkey. The photo shows the Syria Street.]]
In antiquity, it was an important Greek town, called Attouda (Αττούδα), that existed through the [[ancient Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] eras; it was near the cities ([[Hierapolis]] and [[Laodicea on the Lycus]]) and flourished through the [[Byzantine]] period.

The city was conquered by the [[Seljuk Turks]]. Inhabitants of Laodicea were also resettled here in the Seljuk period.<ref>John Freely, ''The western shores of Turkey: discovering the Aegean and Mediterranean coasts'', 2004. {{ISBN|1-85043-618-5}}. p. 182.</ref>

[[Ibn Battuta]] visited the city, noting that "In it there are seven mosques for the observance of Friday prayers, and it has splendid gardens, perennial streams, and gushing springs. Most of the artisans there are Greek women, for in it are many Greeks who are subject to the Turks and who pay dues to the sultan, including the ''[[jizya]]'', and other taxes."<ref>{{cite book |last1=Battutah |first1=Ibn |title=The Travels of Ibn Battutah |date=2002 |publisher=Picador |location=London |isbn=9780330418799 |pages=105, 309}}</ref>

In the 17th century, the Ottoman traveller [[Evliya Çelebi]] visited Denizli and recorded the town as follows: "The city is called by Turks as (Denizli) (which means ''has abundant of water sources like sea'' in Turkish) as there are several rivers and lakes around it. In fact it is a four-day trip from the sea. Its fortress is of square shape built on flat ground. It has no ditches. Its periphery is 470 steps long. It has four gates. These are: painters gate in North, saddle-makers gate in the East, new Mosque gate in the South, and vineyard gate in the West. There are some fifty armed watchmen in the fortress, and they attend the shop. The main city is outside the fortress with 44 districts and 3600 houses. There are 57 small and large mosques and district mosques, 7 [[madrasahs]], 7 children's schools, 6 baths and 17 [[dervish]] lodges. As everybody lives in vineyards the upper classes and ordinary people do not flee from each other."{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

The city lived in peace for centuries without being involved in wars in a direct manner. Following [[World War I]], during the [[Turkish War of Independence]], the [[Greek Army]] managed to capture and come as close as [[Sarayköy]], a small town {{convert|20|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} northwest of Denizli, but did not venture into Denizli. They were then ousted from the region by [[Mustafa Kemal Pasha]]. The most widespread symbols of Denizli province are of textile industry.

==Climate==
Denizli has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]]: ''Csa'' or [[Trewartha climate classification|Trewartha]]: ''Cs''), with hot, dry summers and mild to cool, rainy winters. The inland areas, like Çardak, Bozkurt, Çivril, and Çal districts/counties of the province are cooler and have a higher elevation than the seaside, western part of the Province. Therefore, there are climatic differences within the province and even in the Denizli urbanized area.{{Citation needed|date=May 2021}} The land is open to winds coming from the Aegean Sea as the mountains are perpendicular to the coastline.

===Transportation===
[[Denizli Çardak Airport]] is about 45 minutes drive from the city center.

The extension of İzmir-Aydın [[highway]] to Denizli has been announced for several years. Initial infrastructure was laid in [[Aydın]], but the rest is still forthcoming. The present Aydın-Denizli road, has a very high level of traffic, especially trucks, with each town along the road possessing its own industrial zone.

===Places of interest===
* [[Laodicea ad Lycum]] - {{convert|6|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} north of Denizli near the village of [[Eskihisar, Denizli|Eskihisar]]. The city was established by [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] King, [[Antiochus II Theos|Antiochus II]] in honor of his wife, Laodice. This trading city was famous for its woolen and cotton cloths. A letter written by a Laodecian says: "I am happy. I have fortune and I am not in need of anything." Following a large earthquake which destroyed the city, what remains of the ancient city are one of the seven churches of [[Asia Minor]], the [[stadium]], the [[amphitheatre]] and the [[odeon (building)|odeon]], the [[cistern]] and the [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]]. ''(see further [[Laodicean Church]])''
* [[Hierapolis]] and [[Pamukkale]] [[World Heritage Site]]s -{{convert|20|km|0|abbr=on}} north of Denizli [[:File:pamukkale.jpg|Pamukkale]] [[:File:pamukkale2.jpg|travertines]]. The city of Hierapolis was founded by the [[Pergamon]] King [[Eumenes II]] in 190 BC. Its closeness to Laodicea led to commercial and military rivalry. The town was built in Greek style. Despite suffering a violent earthquake in 17 AD, it reached its peak during the Roman and Byzantine periods.  It was reconstructed during the 2nd and 3rd centuries in stone from quarries in the area, in a Roman style. The town had its most glorious years during the reign of Roman Emperors [[Septimius Severus]] and [[Caracalla]] and became an episcopal seat during the expansion of Christianity. However, as a result of several earthquakes, the most violent of which was in 1354, a great part of the town was destroyed, and its people migrated.
* The [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuq]] [[caravanserai]] Akhan, which is {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=on}} from Denizli City on the Ankara highway, and a great part of which still remains, was constructed by Karasungur bin Abdullah in 1253-54 when he was acting as the commander of Ladik. It was recently restored along with the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[konak (residence)|konaks]] nearby and is set to become a visitor's attraction by its own right.
* [[Honaz]] mountain is a popular picnic excursion for Denizli's people in summer.
* The nearby village of ''Goncalı'', which is on the railway line, is another excursion. People come to eat the charcoal-grilled thinly-cut kebab called ''[[List of kebabs#Turkish kebabs|çöp şiş]]'', preferably with the local [[strained yogurt|süzme yoghurt]] and a glass of [[rakı]].
* There is a statue of [[Atatürk]] at Çınar Meydanı in the city centre.
* [[Servergazi türbesi]] is located near to the Yenişehir neighborhood. The tomb of the 12th century Turkish commander of the [[Great Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] [[akinji|akıncı]] unit is located there. Many locals visit and pray at the tomb especially on weekends.
* [[Teraspark Shopping and Lifestyle Center]], Teraspark AVM, located in Yenişehir. Teraspark AVM is the biggest shopping center in Denizli.
* [[Forum Çamlık Shopping and Lifestyle Center]], Forum Çamlık AVM, located in the heart of the city centre, Demokrasi Meydanı/Square and surrounded by residential areas, welcomes more than 450,000 people within a catchment area of 20 minutes. The design of Forum Çamlık was inspired by the rich architectural elements that are unique to Province of Denizli. Local stones like Denizli [[travertine]] and marble are used for the cladding of many buildings.
