'''Cross River State''' is a [[States of Nigeria|state]] in the [[South South|South-South]] geopolitical zone of [[Nigeria]]. Named for the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]], the state was formed from the eastern part of the [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]] on 27 May 1967. Its capital is [[Calabar]], it borders to the north through [[Benue State|Benue state]], to the west through [[Ebonyi State|Ebonyi state]] and [[Abia State|Abia state]], and to the southwest through [[Akwa Ibom State|Akwa Ibom state]], while its eastern border forms part of the national [[Cameroon-Nigeria border|border with]] [[Cameroon]].<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|last=E.J. Alagoa|first=Tekena N. Tamuno|title=Land and people of Nigeria: Rivers State|year=1989}}</ref> Originally known as the '''[[South-Eastern State, Nigeria|South-Eastern State]]''' before being renamed in 1976, Cross River state formerly included the area that is now [[Akwa Ibom State|Akwa Ibom state]], which became a distinct state in 1987.<ref name="pulse.ng">{{cite web |title=This is how the 36 states were created |url=https://www.pulse.ng/news/local/nigerian-states-this-is-how-the-36-states-were-created/mdtnq3e |website=Pulse.ng |date=24 October 2017 |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

Of the [[States of Nigeria|36 states]] in Nigeria, Cross River state is the [[List of Nigerian states by area|nineteenth largest in area]] and [[List of Nigerian states by population|27th most populous]], with an estimated population of over 3.8 million as of 2016.<ref name=":1">{{cite web |title=Population 2006-2016 |url=https://nigerianstat.gov.ng/elibrary/read/474 |website=[[National Bureau of Statistics, Nigeria|National Bureau of Statistics]] |access-date=14 December 2021}}</ref> Geographically, the state is mainly divided between the [[Guinean forest–savanna mosaic]] in the far north and the [[Cross–Sanaga–Bioko coastal forests]] in the majority of the interior of the state. The smaller [[List of ecoregions in Nigeria|ecoregions]] are the [[Central African mangroves]] in the coastal far south and a part of the [[Montane ecosystems|montane]] [[Cameroonian Highlands forests]] in the extreme northeast. The most major geographical feature is the state's namesake, the [[Cross River (Nigeria)|Cross River]], which bisects the state's interior before forming much of the state's western border and flowing into the Cross River Estuary. Other important rivers are the [[Calabar River|Calabar]] and [[Great Kwa River|Great Kwa]] rivers, which flow from the inland [[Oban Hills]], before flanking the city of [[Calabar]] and flowing into the Cross River Estuary as well. In the forested interior of the state are several biodiverse [[Protected areas of Nigeria|protected areas]] including the [[Cross River National Park]], [[Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary]], and [[Mbe Mountains Community Forest]]. These wildlife reserves contain populations of [[Preuss's red colobus]], [[African forest buffalo]], [[bat hawk]], [[tree pangolin]], [[grey-necked rockfowl]], and [[West African slender-snouted crocodile]], along with some of Nigeria's last remaining [[Nigeria-Cameroon chimpanzee]], [[Drill (animal)|drill]], [[African forest elephant]], and [[Cross River gorilla]] populations.<ref name=":2">{{cite web |title=Cross River National Park (Oban Division) |url=https://nigeria.wcs.org/Wild-Places/Cross-River-NP-Oban.aspx |website=[[Wildlife Conservation Society|WCS]] Nigeria |access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cross River National Park (Okwangwo Division) |url=https://nigeria.wcs.org/Wild-Places/Cross-River-NP-Okwangwo.aspx |website=[[Wildlife Conservation Society|WCS]] Nigeria |access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Afi Mountain Wildlife Sanctuary |url=https://nigeria.wcs.org/Wild-Places/Afi-Mountain-Wildlife-Sanctuary.aspx |website=[[Wildlife Conservation Society|WCS]] Nigeria |access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mbe Mountains |url=https://nigeria.wcs.org/Wild-Places/Mbe-Mountains.aspx |website=[[Wildlife Conservation Society|WCS]] Nigeria |access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref>

Modern-day Cross River state has been inhabited by several ethnic groups for hundreds of years, primarily the [[Efik people|Efik]] of the riverside south and [[Calabar]]; the [[Ekoi people|Ekoi (Ejagham)]] of the inland south; the [[Akunakuna]], [[Boki people|Boki]], [[Bahumono]], and [[Yakö people|Yakö (Yakurr)]] of the [[Cross River Central Senatorial District|central region]]; and the [[Bekwarra]], [[Ogoja]], [[Bette people|Bette]], [[Igede]], [[Ukelle people (Nigeria)|Ukelle (Kukele)]] of the northern region. In the pre-colonial period, what is now Cross River state was divided between its ethnic groups with some joining the [[Aro Confederacy]], while the Efik founded the [[Duke Town|Akwa Akpa (Old Calabar)]] city-state.<ref name=":0" /> The latter become a British protectorate in 1884, as the capital of the [[Oil Rivers Protectorate]]; but it was in the early 1900s that the Britons gained formal control of the entire area. Around the same time, the protectorate (now renamed the [[Niger Coast Protectorate]]) was incorporated into the [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate]], which later merged into [[British Nigeria]].<ref name=Britannica1911>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle = Calabar |volume = 4 |page = 962}}</ref> After the merger, much of the modern-day Cross River state has become a center of anti-colonial resistance during the [[Women's War]] and trade, through the international seaport at [[Calabar]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Calabar |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Calabar |website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Amedi|first=E.|title=Ethics in Nigerian culture|publisher=Heinemann|year=1982}}</ref>

After independence in 1960, the area now regarded as Cross River state was a part of the post-independence [[Eastern Region, Nigeria|Eastern Region]] until 1967, when the region was split and the area became part of the South-Eastern state. Less than two months afterwards, the [[Igbo people|Igbo]]-majority of the former Eastern Region attempted to secede as the state of [[Biafra]]; in the three-year long [[Nigerian Civil War]]. Calabar and its port was hard-fought over in [[Operation Tiger Claw]], while the people from Cross River state were persecuted by the [[Biafra]]n forces as they were mainly non-Igbos.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Omaka |first1=Arua Oko |title=The Forgotten Victims: Ethnic Minorities in the Nigeria-Biafra War, 1967-1970 |journal=Journal of Retracing Africa |date=17 February 2014 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=25–40 |url=https://encompass.eku.edu/jora/vol1/iss1/2/ |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref> At the war's end and the reunification of Nigeria, the South-Eastern state was reformed until 1976, when it was renamed Cross River state.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Kiebel|first=C.B.|title=Juju belief and practice in Nigeria: Rivers State|year=1976}}</ref> Eleven years later, Cross River state was divided with western Cross River being broken off to form the new [[Akwa Ibom State|Akwa Ibom state]].<ref name="pulse.ng"/> The state formerly contained the oil-producing [[Bakassi peninsula|Bakassi Peninsula]], but it was ceded to [[Cameroon]] under the terms of the [[Greentree Agreement]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4789647.stm|title=Nigeria hands Bakassi to Cameroon|date=14 August 2006|access-date=15 December 2021|work=BBC News|archive-date=6 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181106005117/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4789647.stm|url-status=live}}</ref>

As an agricultural state, the Cross River state's economy partially relies on crops, such as [[cocoyam]], [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber]], [[oil palm]], [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]], [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]], [[cashews]], and [[Cooking banana|plantain]] crops, along with fishing. Key minor industries involve tourism in and around the wildlife reserves along with the historic [[Ikom Monoliths]] site, [[Calabar Carnival]], and [[Obudu Mountain Resort]]. Cross River state has the [[List of Nigerian states by Human Development Index#2019|joint-thirteenth highest]] [[Human Development Index]] in the country and numerous institutions of tertiary education.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Human Development Indices |url=https://globaldatalab.org/shdi/shdi/ |website=Global Data Lab |access-date=15 December 2021}}</ref>

== History ==
Cross River as a south-south state was created on 27 May 1967 from the former [[Eastern Region, Nigeria]], by the General [[Yakubu Gowon]] regime. Its name was changed to Cross River state in the 1976 state creation exercise by the then General [[Murtala Mohammed]] regime from South Eastern State.<ref name="books.google.co.uk">{{cite book |author=Benjamin Obi Nwabueze |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B6jrE5CBhl0C&q=creation+of+state+in+south+east+nigeria+without+cross-river&pg=PA222 |title=A Constitutional History of Nigeria |date=1982 |publisher=C.

Its capital is Calabar. Its major towns are [[Akamkpa|Calabar Municipality, Akamkpa]], [[Biase]], [[Calabar South]], [[Ikom]], [[Igede]], [[Obubra]], [[Odukpani]], [[Ogoja]], [[Bekwarra]], [[Ugep]], [[Obudu]], [[Obanliku]], [[Akpabuyo]], Ofutop, Iso-bendghe, Danare, [[Boki, Nigeria|Boki]], [[Yala, Nigeria|Yala]], Bendeghe Ekiem, Etomi, [[Ediba]], [[Itigidi]], [[Ugep]], Ukpe and [[Ukelle]].<ref name=":2" />

=== Climate ===
Like few other Nigerian states, the climate of Cross River state is [[Tropics|tropical]]. Not only this, the state is also characterised with [[Humidity|relative humidity]]. The [[Global temperature record|average temperature]] of the state is between 15°C and 30°C. However, this climatic condition is different in locations within the Cross River state such as the high plateau of [[Obudu]], which has a record of a fall in temperature between 4°C and 10°C, as a result of the high [[altitude]] of this area.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Kerrie.com |url=https://kekerete.tripod.com/CRSG/about.html#:~:text=The%20climate%20within%20Cross%20River,annual%20rainfall%20between%201300%20%E2%80%93%203000mm.}}</ref> The capital city of the State, Calabar, has a significant record of [[rainfall]] within the year, while the dry season has less significant effect in the state due to the depth of rainfall experienced. Based on the records presented by the Climate Data of the state, the annual rainfall of Cross River state is 3306mm (130.2 inches).<ref>{{Cite web |title=climate cross river |url=https://en.climate-data.org/africa/nigeria/cross-river-348/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Ekpe |first=Dr Itita A. |date=2018-01-01 |title=IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON ARTISANAL FISHERIES IN CROSS RIVER ESTUARY, SOUTHERN NIGERIA |url=https://www.academia.edu/40617961 |journal=Unical Graduate School}}</ref>

==Demographics==

The State is composed of several ethnic groups,<ref>{{Cite web|title=List of Tribes in Cross River State Nigeria {{!}} AllNigeriaInfo|date=21 January 2018 |url=https://allnigeriainfo.ng/tribes-in-cross-river/|access-date=2021-08-08|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|title=Cross River {{!}} state, Nigeria|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Cross-River-state-Nigeria|access-date=2021-09-10|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|language=en}}</ref> which include the [[Efik people|Efik]], the [[Ekoi people|Ejagham]], [[Yakö people|Yakurr]], [[Bahumono]], Bette, Yala, [[Igede]], [[Ukelle]] and the Bekwarra among others. There are four major languages spoken in the state: English, the common language, Efik, Bekwarra, and Ejagham. The [[Efik language]] is widely spoken in Cross River State, especially in Calabar Municipality, Calabar South, Akpabuyo, Bakassi, Akampkpa, Biase, and Odukpani Local Government Areas.  The [[Ejagham language]] is also widely spoken language in Cross River State.

The Efik-speaking people live mainly in the Southern senatorial districts of Cross River, or as it is commonly referred to, the Greater Calabar district, which includes Calabar Municipality, Calabar South, Bakassi, Biase, Akpabuyo, Odukpani, and Akamkpa LGAs. There is also the Qua community in Calabar, which speaks Ejagham. The main Ejagham group occupies mostly the Greater Calabar areas of Calabar Municipality, Odukpani, Biase and Akamkpa sections of Cross River State.{{fact|date=May 2024}}

There are also the [[Yakurr]] /Agoi/[[Bahumono]] ethnic groups in Yakurr and Abi LGA, while the Mbembe are predominantly found in Obubra LGA. Further up the core northern part of the state are several sub-dialectical groups, among which are Etung, Olulumo, Ofutop, Nkim/Nkum, Abanajum, Nseke and [[Boki people|Boki]] in both Ikom, Etung and Boki LGAs. Also, the Yala/Yache, Igede, Ukelle, Ekajuk, Mbube, Bette, Bekwarra and Utukwang people are found in Ogoja, Yala, Obudu, Obanliku and Bekwarra LGAs. The Yala are a subgroup of the Idoma nation, part of the Yala LGA's subgroups are the Igede speaking people believed to have migrated from the Oju part of Benue State, who migrated from Ora, in Edo North.{{fact|date=May 2024}}

In Cross River North, Bekwarra is one of the most widely spoken language.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Cross River State |url=https://www.crossriverhub.com/about-cross-river-state/ |access-date=2022-08-30 |website=Cross River Hub |language=en-US}}</ref> It is understood by other tribes in the district. This language along with Efik and Ejagham is used for news broadcast in the state owned radio and TV stations.{{fact|date=May 2024}}

Cross River State epitomises the nation's linguistic and cultural plurality and it is important to note that, in spite of the diversity of dialects, all the Indigenous languages in the state have common linguistic roots as Niger-Congo languages. Finally, the State serves as the venue of the largest carnival in [[Africa.com|Africa.]]<ref>{{Cite web|title=25 Interesting Facts About Cross River State|date=17 July 2020|url=https://www.thehistoryville.com/cross-river-states-interesting-facts/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=2019-10-14|title=Cross River State History, LGA & Senatorial Districts|url=https://www.aziza.com.ng/read/2019/10/cross-river-state-history-and-there-local-government/|access-date=2022-01-31|website=Aziza Goodnews|language=en-US}}</ref>
