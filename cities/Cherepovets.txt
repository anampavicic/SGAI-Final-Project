==Etymology==
The origin of the word "Cherepovets" is a subject of much debate among the local historians. According to one version, the city supposedly received its name from the word "skull" ({{langx|ru|череп}}, ''cherep''). In antiquity, a pagan sanctuary was there in honor of the god [[Veles (god)|Veles]] on the hill at the [[confluence]] of the [[Sheksna River|Sheksna]] and [[Yagorba River]]s. The top of the hill was called the "skull."<ref>{{Cite web|last=А.Л.|first=Шилов|title=Череповец: к этимологии названия: (реализация древне-вепсской традиции номинации населенных пунктов) {{!}} Рябининские чтения – 2003{{!}} Электронная библиотека {{!}} Музей-заповедник "Кижи"|url=https://kizhi.karelia.ru/library/ryabinin-2003/91.html|url-status=live|access-date=2021-05-11|website=kizhi.karelia.ru|language=ru|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002201237/http://kizhi.karelia.ru/library/ryabinin-2003/91.html |archive-date=October 2, 2012 }}</ref> Another version suggests that the word "Cherepovets" originates from the name of the tribe "Ves" ({{lang|ru|весь}}), who inhabited the Sheksna's banks. According to this version, "Cherepovets" in the [[Veps language|language]] of local indigenous [[Vepsians|Veps]] means "Veps' fish hill."<ref>{{Cite web|title=Канал 12 Череповец : Легенды нашего города.

==History==
[[File:Череповец Здание школы 1.jpg|thumb|left|Cherepovets real school building (1902)]]
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2019}}
[[File:Церковь Рождества в Череповце.jpg|thumb|Restored Church of the Nativity (1789)]]

The foundation of Cherepovets is traditionally ascribed to two orthodox monks Feodosy and Afanasy. In 1362, they founded the [[Cherepovets Resurrection Monastery]], in the vicinity of which a small village of Fedosyevo was founded. Historians consider the former village of Fedosyevo to be in the center of modern Cherepovets. Several centuries were needed to develop the small village into a prominent trade, manufacturing, and regional transportation center. Cherepovets was granted city status in 1777 by [[Catherine the Great]] and became the center of a separate'' [[uyezd]]'' in the administrative structure of the [[Novgorod Governorate]].

The construction of the [[Volga–Baltic Waterway|Mariinsk canal system]] in 1810 made a significant impact on the development of the city. The [[Mariinsk Canal System]] connected Cherepovets with the Volga River to the south and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the west. At that time, the city was still at a very early stage of development with a population of 3000 residents by 1863. For a long time, the city brickworks with seven workers was the sole industrial enterprise in Cherepovets.

The development of the city became more dynamic after [[Emancipation reform of 1861|Emancipation Reform]] happened in 1861 and the appearance of the shipbuilding industry. The city soon became a prominent shipbuilding and logistics center connecting major regional railways and waterways. The population had grown to 10,000 by 1915.

After the revolution, in March 1918, eastern ''uyezds'' of the Novgorod Governorate were renamed to separate [[Cherepovets Governorate]] centered around Cherepovets. The new governorate existed for less than 10 years. In 1927, it was merged with [[Saint Petersburg Governorate|Leningrad]], [[Novgorod Governorate|Novgorod]], [[Pskov Governorate|Pskov]], and [[Murmansk Governorate]]s into a single [[Leningrad Oblast]]. In September 1937, most of the former Cherepovets Governorate territories (except for [[Tikhvin]] district) were transferred to the newly established [[Vologda Oblast]].

The subsequent development of the city is closely related to the completion of the construction of the Cherepovets steel mill (now known as [[Severstal]]) in 1955, the second-largest in the country. Unlike the majority of the most important metallurgy centers in the former Soviet Union, the location of the future steel plant was selected far away from the actual mineral resources and deposits. The reason for that was the logistic advantage of having a well-developed infrastructure that allowed connection of the north and northwest of the country by rail, road, and waterways into a single operation system. It connected such remote mining centers as [[Vorkuta]] and [[Olenegorsk, Murmansk Oblast]].

The rapid growth of the industry center drastically changed the city, and by the early 1960s, its population exceeded 100,000 residents (three times bigger than the pre-[[World War II]] population). By 1970, Cherepovets had become the most populated city in Vologda Oblast.

==Geography==
The city is located near the major Volga-Baltic waterway, west–east railroads, gas pipelines, and between two Russian [[federal cities of Russia|federal cities]], [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|St.&nbsp;Petersburg]].

===Climate===
Cherepovets has a distinctive four-seasons [[humid continental climate]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather-summary.php3?s=31172&cityname=Cherepovets%2C+Northwestern+Federal+District%2C+Russia&units=|title=Cherepovets, Russia, Climate Summary|publisher=Weatherbase|access-date=January 24, 2015}}</ref> (Dfb) (just above [[subarctic climate|subarctic]] (Dfc)), with warm summers and cold but not extremely cold winters by Russian standards. It falls into the humid continental zone by the fourth warmest month being just above {{convert|10|C|F}} in mean temperature and the annual temperature being {{convert|3.3|C|F}},<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=31172&cityname=Cherepovets-|title=Cherepovets, Russia, Temperature Averages|publisher=Weatherbase|access-date=January 24, 2015}}</ref> above the freezing point. Winter, however, lasts for five months, rendering transitional periods rather short.

==Economy==
Cherepovets is an important industrial center in northwestern Russia, mostly known as the country's largest steel manufacturing plant, with exports going to more than 50 countries around the world.

===Metallurgy===
The city began growing rapidly with the construction of steel mills in the late 1930s. The first blast furnace was put into operation in 1955. The first Cherepovets iron was produced in August 1955 and steel in May 1958. In February 1959, the first ingot was rolled in a blooming mill, and in November of the same year, the first hot-rolled plate was produced.

Nowadays, complex processes of iron and steel production are highly automated. The workshops have been modernized according to the latest advances in engineering and technology of metal production. The [[joint-stock company]] '[[Severstal]]' (LSE, MOEX) is a global exporter of ferrous and nonferrous metals: iron, steel, hot-rolled plates, cold roll-formed shapes, and other products.

===Chemical industry===
The second largest industry in the city is the chemical industry. Its main production area is concentrated in mineral fertilizers. [[PhosAgro]] (LSE, MOEX) is the largest producer of phosphate-based fertilizers and phosphoric and sulfuric acids in Europe.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} It is also one of the leading producers of [[NPK]] fertilizers, [[ammonia]], and [[ammonium nitrate]] in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vologda-oblast.ru/en/about_the_region/economy/key_industries/%D1%81hemical_industry/|title=Chemical Industry|publisher=Vologda Oblast Official Website|access-date=17 May 2014|archive-date=March 4, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043622/http://vologda-oblast.ru/en/about_the_region/economy/key_industries/%D1%81hemical_industry/|url-status=dead}}</ref>

As an outcome of the high volume of metallurgical and chemical production, Cherepovets is one of the most heavily polluted cities in the world. According to a 2011 assessment, the city ranked second only after [[Norilsk]], Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/photolents/20110623/164796740_3.html|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120709065050/http://en.rian.ru/photolents/20110623/164796740_3.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=July 9, 2012|title=Russia's top 10 most polluted cities|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|access-date=December 17, 2011}}</ref>
