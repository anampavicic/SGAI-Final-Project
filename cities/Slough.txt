The name was first recorded in 1195 as ''Slo''. It first seems to have applied to a hamlet between [[Upton, Slough|Upton]] to the east and [[Chalvey]] to the west, roughly around the "Crown Crossroads" where the road to Windsor (now the A332) met the Great West Road.<ref>Fraser (1973), p. 4.</ref> The [[Domesday Book|Domesday]] Survey of 1086 refers to Upton, and a wood for 200 pigs, worth £15. During the 13th century, King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] had a palace at Cippenham. Parts of Upton Court were built in 1325, while St Mary the Virgin Church<ref name="stmarythevirgin">{{cite web | url = http://www.findachurch.co.uk/search/church_view.php?church_id=43878 | title = St Mary the Virgin Church | publisher = findachurch.co.uk | access-date = 29 July 2010 | archive-date = 24 September 2017 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170924225619/http://www.findachurch.co.uk/search/church_view.php?church_id=43878 | url-status = dead }}</ref> in [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]] was probably built in the late 11th or early 12th century, though it has been rebuilt and enlarged several times.

From the mid-17th century, [[stagecoach]]es began to pass through Slough and [[Salt Hill]] (later absorbed into Slough), which became locations for the second stage to change horses on the journey out from London. By 1838 and the opening of the [[Great Western Railway]], Upton-cum-Chalvey's parish [[Population of Slough|population]] had reached 1,502. In 1849, a [[Slough to Windsor & Eton Line|branch line]] was completed from [[Slough railway station|Slough]] to [[Windsor & Eton Central railway station|Windsor & Eton Central]], opposite [[Windsor Castle]], for [[Queen Victoria]]'s convenience.

Slough has 96 [[listed building]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slough.gov.uk/documents/app5.pdf |title=Listed buildings in Slough |date=March 2004 |access-date=27 November 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616142034/http://www.slough.gov.uk/documents/app5.pdf |archive-date=16 June 2007 }}</ref> There are

1918 saw a large area of agricultural land to the west of Slough developed as an army motor repair depot, used to store and repair huge numbers of motor vehicles coming back from the battlefields of the [[First World War]] in [[Flanders]]. In April 1920, the Government sold the site and its contents to the Slough Trading Co. Ltd. Repair of ex-army vehicles continued until 1925, when the Slough Trading Company Act was passed allowing the company (renamed [[Segro|Slough Estates Ltd]]) to establish an [[Industrial park|industrial estate]].<ref>Fraser (1973), p. 109.</ref> Spectacular growth and employment ensued, with Slough attracting workers from many parts of the UK and abroad. [[Slough Town Hall]], which was designed by [[Charles Holloway James]] and [[Stephen Rowland Pierce]], was completed in 1937.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/casework/press/release/slough-town-hall-listing-refused.html|title=Slough Town Hall|publisher=20th Century Society|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225053917/http://www.c20society.org.uk/casework/press/release/slough-town-hall-listing-refused.html|access-date=8 February 2021|archive-date=25 February 2012}}</ref>

During the [[Second World War]], Slough experienced a series of [[The Blitz|air raids]], mostly in October 1940 (the largest number of people, five, dying as a result of a raid on the 13th), and an emergency hospital treating casualties from London was set up in Slough. Local air raid deaths and deaths at the hospital account for the 23 civilian lives recorded lost in the borough area.<ref name="cwgc">[http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/4003871/SLOUGH,%20MUNICIPAL%20BOROUGH] CWGC Cemetery Report. Accessed 18 September 2012. Information in this paragraph based on attached casualty reports.</ref>

After the war, several further large housing developments arose to take large numbers of people migrating from war-damaged London.  Between 1955 and 1957 the town was the site of the [[Slough experiment]], a large-scale road safety trial.<ref>{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/op1265793-1001|title=Road safety : the Slough experiment|last=Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation|date=1957|publisher=HMSO|others=University of Southampton}}</ref>

The old Slough library was opened on 28 November 1974. It was officially called the Robert Taylor Library, named after Alderman Taylor in recognition of his contribution to the library service. The library was officially opened by the Mayor, Councillor DR Peters, on 15 May 1975. It was demolished in May 2017 as part of the programme of redevelopment in the town centre.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sloughhistoryonline.org.uk/ixbin/hixclient.exe?a=query&p=slough&f=generic_theme.htm&_IXFIRST_=1&_IXMAXHITS_=1&=theme_record_id=sl-sl-libraries&s=LqvK4sMftRa|title=Search Results - No Matches}}</ref>

In the 21st century, Slough has seen major redevelopment of the town centre. Old buildings are being replaced with new offices and shopping complexes. [[Tesco]] has replaced an existing superstore with a larger [[Tesco Extra]]. The [[Heart of Slough]] Project is plan for the large-scale redevelopment of the town centre as a focus and cultural quarter for the creative media, information and communications industries created a mixed-use complex, multi-functional buildings, visual landmarks and a public space in the [[Thames Valley]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/berkshire/6201145.stm |work=BBC News Online |title=Backing for town's £400m makeover|date=21 December 2006 |access-date=23 May 2010}}</ref> Approval was given for the £400 million project by Slough Borough Council's planning committee on 9 July 2009,<ref>[http://www.slough.gov.uk/news/articles/19344.aspx Heart of Slough planning approval]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718215029/http://www.slough.gov.uk/news/articles/19344.aspx |date=18 July 2009 }}</ref> and work began in 2010 for completion in 2018.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2008/01/21/heart_of_slough_feature.shtml BBC – Berkshire – Features – Heart of Slough].</ref>

In December 2009, two key components of the project were signed: the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) signed its agreement to provide £11m of funding for infrastructure and Thames Valley University (TVU) courses which were due to remain in the town found a new home at the Centre in Farnham Road, Slough.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/news/article-14142-progress-for-heart-of-slough-project/ |title=Progress for Heart of Slough project |newspaper=Maidenhead Advertiser |date=17 December 2009 |first=Nick |last=Mayo |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724205823/http://www.maidenhead-advertiser.co.uk/news/article-14142-progress-for-heart-of-slough-project/ |archive-date=24 July 2015 }}</ref> In parallel to the town centre redevelopment plan, [[Segro]] (owner of the Slough Trading Estate) planned to spend £600 million over the following 20 years on the estate. This was intended to create environmentally sustainable buildings, open green spaces, two hotels, a conference centre, cafés, restaurants and better transport facilities to improve links to Slough town centre and the surrounding residential areas. It was claimed that the plan would create more than 4,100 new jobs and contribute around £100m a year to Slough's economy.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.propertyweek.com/story.asp?storycode=3143131 | work = Property Week | title = Segro unveils images of Slough Trading Estate | first = Aditi | last = Shah | date = 18 June 2009 }}</ref> If both plans went ahead, nearly £1 billion would be spent on redeveloping Slough over the next 20 years.

Redevelopment on this scale has been strongly criticised by conservation groups. [[The Twentieth Century Society]] has stated that
<blockquote>
[A] tragically high quantity of good buildings have been demolished in Slough in recent years, including grand Art-Deco-styled factories by the likes of Wallis Gilbert and high-quality post-war offices. More are to come down as the town tries to erase its past and reinvent itself from scratch. Despite famously heckling Slough, [[John Betjeman]]'s praise for the town hall's architecture as 'a striving for unity out of chaos' in 1948 has never been so relevant as today. C20 believes that the redevelopment of the town hall would be an act of vandalism to the civic centre and is supporting the Campaign to Save Slough's Heritage in their request for a review of the decision.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.c20society.org.uk/casework/press/release/slough-town-hall-listing-refused.html |publisher=The Twentieth Century Society |title=Slough Town Hall Listing Refused&nbsp;— DCMS overturns English Heritage's advice again |date=16 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225053917/http://www.c20society.org.uk/casework/press/release/slough-town-hall-listing-refused.html |archive-date=25 February 2012 }}</ref>

==Geography==
Slough is {{convert|20|mi|km}} west of [[Charing Cross]], central [[London]], {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} north of [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]], {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} east of [[Maidenhead]], {{convert|11|mi|km|0}} south-east of [[High Wycombe]] and {{convert|19|mi|km|0}} north-east of the [[county town]] of [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]]. Slough is within the [[Greater London Urban Area]] and on the border with [[London Borough of Hillingdon]] and [[London Borough of Hounslow]]. Heathrow Airport is 5 miles away. Nearby towns are [[Uxbridge]] to the northeast and [[Beaconsfield]] to the north.

Most of the area that now makes up Slough was [[ancient counties of England|anciently]] part of [[Buckinghamshire]], however, Poyle was historically in Middlesex. The town developed by the expansion and amalgamation of villages along the [[A4 road (England)|Great West Road]]. Over the years Slough has expanded greatly, incorporating a number of different villages. Original villages that are now suburbs of Slough include [[Chalvey]], [[Cippenham]], [[Colnbrook]], [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]], [[Poyle]], [[Upton, Slough|Upton]], and [[Wexham]].

Named neighbourhoods include Brands Hill, [[Britwell]], [[Huntercombe, Slough|Huntercombe]], Manor Park, [[Salt Hill]], Upton Lea and [[Windsor Meadows]]. The urban area merges into the neighbouring [[parishes]] of [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]], a small area of [[Taplow]] near [[Cippenham]], [[Farnham Royal]] and [[Stoke Poges]] which remain in the county of Buckinghamshire and [[Datchet]] which is in Berkshire. [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] is narrowly [[buffer zone|buffered]] by the [[Jubilee River]] and by green space (mainly the college playing fields) from part of Slough, and the two areas formerly formed the Eton birth, marriages and deaths registration district.

===Climate===
The nearest [[Met Office]] weather observing station to Slough is [[Heathrow Airport]], about {{convert|5|mi|0}} east of Slough town centre. This part of the [[Thames Valley]] is notable for generally having the warmest daytime summer temperatures on average in the [[British Isles]].{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Typically, according to 1981–2010 normals, the average high temperature in July is 23.5&nbsp;°C (74.3&nbsp;°F.)

Rainfall is low compared to most of the British Isles, with under {{convert|600|mm|2|abbr=on}} annually, and 105 days<ref>{{cite web

Aside from English, the most commonly spoken languages are [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Urdu]].<ref>Census 2021 - [https://democracy.slough.gov.uk/documents/s76262/Appendix%20B%20-%20Slough%20Insights%20-%20March%202023.pdf Slough Insights]  Retrieved 19 June 2024.</ref>

==Governance==
{{Main|Slough Borough Council|Borough of Slough}}
There is one main tier of local government covering Slough, at [[Unitary authorities of England|unitary authority]] level: [[Slough Borough Council]], which is based at [[Observatory House]] in the town centre. Most of the urban area is [[Unparished area|unparished]], although some of the suburbs are included in [[civil parish]]es, including [[Britwell]] and [[Wexham Court]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Election Maps |url=https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/election-maps/gb/ |publisher=Ordnance Survey |access-date=18 July 2024}}</ref>

===Administrative history===
Slough was historically a hamlet in the parish of [[Upton, Slough|Upton]], also known as Upton-cum-Chalvey, in [[Buckinghamshire]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Slough Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10066372#tab02 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=18 July 2024}}</ref> Until 1863 it was administered by the parish [[vestry]] and [[manorial court]]s, in the same way as most rural areas. As Slough began developing into a town, the need for more urban forms of local government grew. In 1863 a [[Local board of health#Local Government Act 1858|local government district]] was established for Slough, covering part of the parish of Upton-cum-Chalvey (including the old village of Upton) and a smaller part of the neighbouring parish of [[Stoke Poges]]. The town was then governed by an elected local board.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=22753|page=3517|date=14 July 1863}}</ref>

Such local government districts were converted into [[Urban district (England and Wales)|urban districts]] under the [[Local Government Act 1894]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Stoke in Slough Civil Parish |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10010044 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=19 July 2024}}</ref> In 1900 the Slough urban district was enlarged to absorb most of the residual parts of the old Upton-cum-Chalvey parish that had been outside the urban district, including [[Chalvey]]. The urban district was further enlarged in 1930, when it was significantly expanded to take in most of the neighbouring parish of [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]] (including the village), the [[Salt Hill]] area from the parish of [[Farnham Royal]], and the [[Cippenham]] area from the parish of [[Burnham, Buckinghamshire|Burnham]]. In 1938 the urban district was incorporated to become a [[municipal borough]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Slough Urban District / Municipal Borough |url=https://visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10002126 |website=A Vision of Britain through Time |publisher=GB Historical GIS / University of Portsmouth |access-date=18 July 2024}}</ref> 

In 1974, the [[Municipal Borough of Slough]] was replaced by a larger [[non-metropolitan district]] with [[Borough status in the United Kingdom|borough status]] called Slough. The enlarged district gained the [[Britwell]] and [[Wexham Court]] areas, and was transferred from Buckinghamshire to Berkshire.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The English Non-Metropolitan Districts (Definition) Order 1972|year=1972|number=2039|access-date=18 July 2024}}</ref> The borough was enlarged in 1995 to take in [[Colnbrook with Poyle]].<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Surrey (County Boundaries) Order 1994|year=1994|number=330}}</ref>

In 1998 Slough Borough Council became a unitary authority when [[Berkshire County Council]] was abolished and the borough council took on the former county council's functions in the borough.<ref>{{cite legislation UK|type=si|si=The Berkshire (Structural Change) Order 1996|year=1996|number=1879|access-date=31 May 2023}}</ref>

Since 2015, Slough has had a Youth Parliament to represent the views of younger people.

Before the 19th century, the main businesses of Slough were brickfields and agriculture. The bricks for the building of [[Eton College]] were made in Slough. Later, as the Great West Road traffic increased, inns and pubs sprang up along the road to service the passing trade. Until the town developed as an industrial area, [[Nursery (horticulture)|nurseries]] were prominent in the local economy; the [[Cox's Orange Pippin]] apple was first raised in Colnbrook (not then within Slough) around 1825, and the [[dianthus]] "Mrs Sinkins Pink" was first raised at some point between 1868<ref>p20, ''The Changing Face of Slough'', Slough Museum, Breedon Books, Derby, 2003</ref> and 1883<ref>Fraser (1973), p. 100.</ref> by John Sinkins, the master of the [[Eton, Berkshire|Eton]] [[Poor Law Union|Union]] [[Workhouse]],<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plantprofile_pinks.shtml Plant profiles: Pinks, dianthus]. BBC Gardening. Retrieved 24 February 2007. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205203050/http://www.bbc.co.uk/gardening/plants/plantprofile_pinks.shtml |date=5 February 2009 }}</ref> which lay in Slough.

In the mid-19th century, the only major employer apart from the brickfields was [[James Elliman]], who started as a draper in Chandos Street. In 1847, he changed business and manufactured his [[:File:Ellimans-Universal-Embrocation-Slough-1897-Ad.png|''Elliman's Embrocation'']] and ''Royal Embrocation'' horse [[liniment]] at factories in Wellington Street and Chandos Street. Elliman became a major benefactor to the town, and is remembered today in the names of local roads and schools.

In September 1851, [[William Thomas Buckland]], an [[auctioneer]] and [[surveying|surveyor]] from nearby [[Wraysbury]], began livestock sales in a field near the [[Slough railway station|''Great Western Road Railway Station'']] belonging to the ''North Star Inn''. Originally held on the first Tuesday of every month, the Cattle Market's popularity soon saw this increased to every Tuesday. A move to Wexham Street was necessitated by the postwar redevelopment of the town. The ''Slough Cattle Market'' was run by ''Messrs Buckland and Sons'' until its final closure in 1988.<ref>''The History of Buckland & Sons'' by Edward Barry Bowyer FRICS (1973).</ref>

In 1906, [[Horlicks|James Horlick]], one of the founders of the eponymous [[malted milk]] company, opened a purpose-built red-brick factory near Slough Railway Station to manufacture his malted milk product. In 2015, the business was sold by Glaxo Smith Kline and in 2017, manufacturing at the site ceased altogether. The site is currently proposed to become residential making use of the original buildings as much as possible.

Starting in the 1920s, [[Slough Estates Ltd]], the operator of the original [[Slough Trading Estate]], created and operated many more estates in the UK and abroad. The Slough Trading Estate meant that the town was largely insulated from many of the effects of [[recession]]. For many years, Slough's economy was mainly manufacturing-based. The company Zwicky Limited, a manufacturer of liquid pumps, filters, compression valves and aircraft refuelling units, runway sweepers were based in Slough.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Zwicky | title=Zwicky - Graces Guide }}</ref><ref>https://irp.cdn-website.com/3740d787/files/uploaded/Slough%20Estate%20Journal%201933.pdf {{Bare URL PDF|date=August 2024}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.postcards-from-slough.co.uk/home/slough-at-war/industry-at-war-part-1/ | title=Postcards from Slough - Industry at War }}</ref>

In the last 20 or so years, there has been a major shift from a manufacturing to an information-based economy, with the closure of many factories (some of which had been in Slough for many decades). The factories are rapidly being replaced by office buildings. Hundreds of major companies have sited in Slough Trading Estate over the years, with its proximity to London [[Heathrow Airport]] and good motorway connections being attractive. In the 1960s, [[Gerry Anderson]]'s film company was based in Slough, and his [[Supermarionation]] series, including ''[[Thunderbirds (TV series)|Thunderbirds]]'', were filmed there.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sloughobserver.co.uk/news/15008144.Thunderbirds_return_to_their_Slough_home/|title=Thunderbirds return to their Slough home|date=7 January 2017 }}</ref>

The UK headquarters of [[Mars, Incorporated]] is in Slough, the main factory having been established in 1932 by [[Forrest Mars Sr.]] and [[Frank C. Mars]]. It produced the [[Mars Bar]] in Slough over 70 years ago. One of the Mars factories has been demolished and some production has moved to the Czech Republic. The European head offices of major IT companies such as [[BlackBerry (company)|BlackBerry]], [[McAfee]], [[CA Technologies|Computer Associates]], [[PictureTel]] and Compusys (among others) are all in the town. [[O2 plc|O<sub>2</sub>]] is headquartered in the town across four buildings. The town is also home to the business support organisation [[Thames Valley Chamber of Commerce Group]] and [[National Foundation for Educational Research]], which is housed in the Mere.

Recent new offices include those of [[Nintendo]], [[Black and Decker]] and [[Abbey business centres]].<ref>[https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=502584 Location of registered office of Amazon.co.uk Ltd].

Retrieved 5 March 2011.</ref>

The motor trade has long been represented in Slough. Until 1966, [[Citroën]] assembled cars in a Liverpool Road factory (later used by ''Mars Confectionery''), and it retains its UK headquarters in the town. [[Ford of Britain|Ford]] built [[Ford D series|D Series]] and [[Ford Cargo|Cargo]] lorries at its factory in Langley (a former [[Hawker Aircraft]] site) from 1936 to the 1950s<ref>p120, ''The Changing Face of Slough'', Slough Museum, Breedon Books, Derby, 2003</ref> until the site was redeveloped for housing in the 1990s. [[Ferrari]], [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]], [[Fiat]] and [[Maserati]] now have offices in the town.
