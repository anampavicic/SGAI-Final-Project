==History==
In 2006, traces of a prehistoric, 8000-year-old settlements were found in Shahrud. This is the pre-historical site of [[Deh Kheyr, Semnan]], located in Shahrud Plain, 15 kilometers from the city of Shahrud. The discoveries included ovens, craft workshops, and other evidence of settlements.

Archeological excavations in different parts of Shahrud Plain indicate the existence of villages in this area during 7-5 millennium BC.<ref>[http://www.payvand.com/news/06/mar/1023.html Traces of Prehistoric Civilization Discovered in Shahrud (2006)]</ref>

As a modern city, the city of Shahrud was merely a village before the reign of [[Fath Ali Shah]] of the [[Qajar dynasty]], with two old castles and a small farm named "Shabdary". The surrounding areas however, such as Biarjomand, Miami and Bastam do have a distant history.

The old town of Bastam is located 6&nbsp;km north of Shahrood. Its pre-Islamic history is not clear, but according to some historians, it was built during [[Shapur II]] period (310-379 CE). During the [[Abbasid]] era, it was the second largest town (following [[Damghan]]) in the Qomis province.

The town was visited by [[Naser Khosrow|Nasser Khosrow Qubadiani]], the Iranian poet of the 12th century, and mentioned by him as the center of the Qomis province. Bastam declined during the Mongol era assaults, and Shahrud eventually took its place.

Although absent from earlier historical sources, Shahrud has become an important town since the 19th century because of its location on the road from [[Tehran]] east to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]].<ref name="Bosworth">{{cite book |last1=Bosworth |first1=C.E. |editor1-last=Bosworth |editor1-first=C.E. |editor2-last=van Donzel |editor2-first=E. |editor3-last=Heinrichs |editor3-first=W.P. |editor4-last=Lecomte |editor4-first=G. |title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. IX (SAN-SZE) |date=1997 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=90-04-10422-4 |pages=198 |url=https://ia600603.us.archive.org/14/items/EncyclopaediaDictionaryIslamMuslimWorldEtcGibbKramerScholars.13/09.EncycIslam.NewEdPrepNumLeadOrient.EdEdComCon.BosDonHeinLec.etc.UndPatIUA.v9.San-Sze.Leid.EJBrill.1997..pdf |access-date=18 March 2022 |chapter=SHĀH RŪD}}</ref> It now also is on the railway.<ref name="Bosworth"/> A road runs from Shahrud across the [[Alborz]] mountains to the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] coastal plains in the north; it is accessible throughout winter.<ref name="Bosworth"/> Shahrud was renamed '''Imāmrūd''' after the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979, but has since reverted to the old name.<ref name="Bosworth"/> It is located just south of the historical city of [[Bastam]].<ref name="Bosworth"/>

==Geography==
===Location===
Situated about an altitude of 1345 m, the main launch site of the [[Iranian Space Agency]] is near Shahrood. It is also well known for unique types of grapes which are cultivated specially in Shahrud. Consequently, Shahrood is known as the City of Grapes.

Some 410 kilometers to the east of [[Tehran]], halfway between the capital and [[Mashad]], and at the junction with the [[Gorgan]] road, sits the modern city of Shahrud, which has grown to absorb the historic town of [[Bistam|Bastam]] situated in the hills a few kilometers to the north.

From the north, it is surrounded by the [[Alborz]] mountains, and from the south by the arid salty deserts. The river of Tash, after crossing this town, reaches the south deserts. The weather on the mountainous areas is cold and it is somewhat temperate in other parts of the city.

Shahrud is in the Damghan basin, a sub-basin of the Kavir basin which also contains the [[Dasht-e Kavir|Great Salt Desert]].

=== Climate ===
Shahrud has a [[cold desert climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''BWk'') with hot summers and very cold winters with freezing nights. Precipitation is very low, and mostly falls in winter (often as snow) and spring.

== Attractions ==
Shahrud's geographical characteristics are varied, with cloud forests in the north and from the south it meets the central desert of Iran. The most interesting geographical and historical attractions of Shahrud are as follows:

* [[Caspian Hyrcanian mixed forests]] and High peaks of East-[[Alborz]] mountain range, lie in north of the city and shape a marvelous mixture of natural elements.
** Two or three hours left to the sunset, with temperature falls, clouds rush into the forest. Jangal-e Abr ([[The Clouds Forest|Cloud Forest)]] is one of the oldest forests in Iran. It is the continuum of northern forests in the south of [[Alborz]] mountain range. It is located 30&nbsp;km north east of Shahrud. The forest is full of steep hills, and a river runs with waterfalls.
** SHAHVAR peak, lies in 25&nbsp;km north of Shahrud, from north near [[Negarman]] village and from south near Tash village, highest peak of East Elbruz mountain range with 4000 m high. Every year thousands of mountain climbers travel to this city to enjoy rock climbing and the surrounding landscapes.
* The Saljuki Mosque which is located in Bastam. Its construction dates to 1120 C.E.
* The Village of Kharaqan which is located 12&nbsp;km from Bastam. It was a famous village during the 14th and the 15th centuries. The tomb of [[Abul-Hassan Kharaqani]], who is one of the most famous ''Arefs'' ([[mysticism|mystics]]) of the [[Sufi]] groups of the 12th century, is located in this village. The brick building with its dome dates to the 12th century.
* The Byar Castle ruins, which is located on the south-eastern area of Bastam, and is near to the desert edge of Byarjomand. This castle has an old mosque and an old wall with three gates.
* Shahrud Museum: Dating from the later [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] and early [[Pahlavi dynasty|Pahlavi]] periods, originally belonging to the Shahrud Municipality and already located in the center of the town, this two-storied structure with brick facing was transformed into the present museum in 1988 after a series of major repair and renovation works. It houses both archaeological and ethnological sections.
