==History==
[[File:José_Eusebio_Boronda.jpg|thumb|left|José Eusebio Boronda, a [[Californio]] ranchero, was granted [[Rancho Rincón del Sanjón]] in 1840, covering today's northwestern Salinas and [[Boronda, California|Boronda]].]]
[[File:Salinas City, First Mayor's House, 1874.jpg|thumb|left|First Mayor's House circa 1868]]
The land that Salinas sits on is thought to have been settled by Native Americans known as the [[Esselen]] prior to 200 AD.<ref>"The Esselen Indians of the Big Sur Country" by Gary S. Breschini and Trudy Haversat</ref> Between 200 and 500 AD, they were displaced by the [[Rumsen people|Rumsen]] group of [[Ohlone people|Ohlone]] speaking people. The Rumsen-Ohlone remained as the inhabitants of the area for approximately another 1,200 years, and in the 1700s, were the group of native inhabitants contacted and recorded by the first Spanish explorers of the Salinas area.

Upon the arrival of the Spanish, large Spanish land grants were initially issued for the [[Spanish missions in California|Catholic Missions]] and also as bonuses to soldiers. Later on after Mexican independence, smaller land grants continued to be issued for [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] where mostly cattle were grazed. One of the many land grants was the [[Rancho Las Salinas]] land grant, part of which included the area of modern-day Salinas. As a result of the many new cattle ranches, a thriving trade eventually developed in cattle hide shipments, shipping primarily out of the Port of Monterey.<ref name="early-salinas">"Early Salinas" by Gary S. Breschini, Mona Gudgel, & Trudy Haversat</ref>

Before the transition to American administration, Monterey had been the capital of California. For a short while after the transition, California was ruled by [[martial law]].<ref name="early-salinas"/>  On September 9, 1850, California was admitted to the Union and became a State, celebrated as [[California Admission Day]].

In the 1850s a junction of two main stage coach routes was located {{convert|18|miles}} east of [[Monterey]] and along the big bend of what is locally referred to as the Alisal Slough.<ref>[http://mchsmuseum.com/halfwayhouse.html The Half Way House and the American Hotel] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161018151712/http://mchsmuseum.com/halfwayhouse.html |date=October 18, 2016 }} Monterey County Historical Society, by G.S. Breschini, 2000, downloaded November 15, 2016.</ref> In 1854, six years after becoming a part of the United States, a group of American settlers living in the vicinity of this route-junction opened a post office at the junction, naming their town "Salinas," apparently a reference to the original "Rancho Las Salinas" name for the area,<ref name=CGN /> which in turn was named in Spanish for the salt marshes of the area around the central Salinas slough, which was drained. Soon thereafter, in 1856, a traveler's inn called the Halfway House was opened at that junction in Salinas.<ref name=CGN />  (The nearby [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]], was apparently only later named by an American cartographer, after the nearest town of Salinas in 1858. Previously that river had gone by the name: "Rio de Monterey."). The streets of Salinas were laid out in 1867, and the town was incorporated in 1874.<ref name=CGN />

The conversion of grazing land to crops and the coming of the rail road in 1868 to transport goods and people was a major turning point in the history and economic advancement of Salinas. Dry farming of wheat, barley, and other grains as well as potatoes and mustard seed was common in the 1800s. Chinese labor drained thousands of acres of swampland to become productive farmland, and as much early farm labor was done by Chinese immigrants, Salinas boasted the second largest [[Chinatown]] in the state, slightly smaller than [[San Francisco]].<ref>"10,000 Years on the Salinas Plain" by Gary S. Breschini, Mona Gudgel, & Trudy Haversat</ref> [[Irrigation]] changed farming in Salinas to mainly row crops of root vegetables, grapes and sugar beets. Many major vegetable producers placed their headquarters in Salinas.<ref name="McKibben 2022"/>  Driven by the profitable agricultural industry, Salinas had the highest per capita income of any city in the United States in 1924.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of Salinas|url=http://www.ci.salinas.ca.us/visitors/history.cfm|website=City of Salinas: Visitors|publisher=City of Salinas|access-date=November 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018230330/http://www.ci.salinas.ca.us/visitors/history.cfm|archive-date=October 18, 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=June 2019}}

During [[World War II]], the [[Salinas Sports Complex|Salinas Rodeo Grounds]] was one of the locations used as a temporary [[Internment|detention camp]] for citizens and immigrant residents of Japanese ancestry, before they were relocated to more permanent and remote facilities. One of seventeen such sites overseen by the Wartime Civilian Control Administration, the Salinas Assembly Center was built after President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] issued [[Executive Order 9066]], authorizing the [[Internment of Japanese Americans|removal and confinement]] of Japanese Americans living on the West Coast. The camp opened on April 27, 1942, and held a total of 3,608 people before closing two months later on July 4. Of the 300 Japanese-American families in Salinas before the war, only 25 returned following internment.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McKibben |first1=Carol |title=The Story of Salinas: How World War II devastated families of Japanese descent |url=https://www.montereyherald.com/2022/10/29/the-story-of-salinas-how-world-war-ii-devastated-families-of-japanese-descent/ |access-date=August 27, 2023 |work=Monterey Herald |date=October 29, 2022}}</ref>

Following [[World War II]] major urban and suburban development converted much farmland to city.

Salinas was also the birthplace of writer and Nobel Prize laureate [[John Steinbeck]]. The historic downtown, known as ''Oldtown Salinas'', features much fine Victorian architecture, and is home to the [[National Steinbeck Center]], the Steinbeck House and the [[John Steinbeck Library]].

Major development took place in the 1990s, with the construction of Creekbridge, Williams Ranch, and Harden Ranch.<ref>[https://www.baltimoresun.com/1992/05/21/salad-days-near-end-in-lettuce-capital-as-development-boom-encroaches/ Salad days near end in lettuce capital as development boom encroaches] .

==Geography==
[[File:Salinas from airplane October 2017.jpg|thumb|right|Salinas and the [[Salinas Valley]]. [[Fremont Peak (California)|Fremont Peak]] and the [[Gabilan Range]] are also shown.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|23.2|sqmi|km2}}, 99.84% of it land and 0.16% of it water.

Prior to mass agricultural and urban development, much of the city consisted of rolling hills bisected by wooded creeks and interspersed with marsh land.<ref name="Monterey County Historical Society">{{cite web|last1=Seavey|first1=Kent|title=A Short History of Salinas, California|url=http://mchsmuseum.com/salinasbrief.html|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150102175431/http://mchsmuseum.com/salinasbrief.html|archive-date=January 2, 2015|access-date=November 26, 2014|website=Monterey County Historical Society}}</ref> Today, the city is located mostly on leveled ground, with some rolling hills and wooded gulches with creeks remaining in the north-eastern Creekbridge and Williams Ranch neighborhoods, as well as the Laurel Heights section of East Salinas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Salinas Topography Map|url=https://www.google.com/maps/@36.686635,-121.6411985,13z/data=!5m1!1e4|website=Google|access-date=November 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150126104026/https://www.google.com/maps/@36.686635,-121.6411985,13z/data=!5m1!1e4|archive-date=January 26, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> The natural ecosystems accompanying the area's topography and environment have been recreated in Natividad Creek Park and adjacent Upper Carr Lake.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Epley|first1=Ellen|title=Creeks of Salinas: Return of the Natives Work in the Creeks Important for Salinas|url=http://ron.csumb.edu/creeks-salinas-0|website=CSUMB|publisher=California State University, Monterey Bay|access-date=November 26, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130307084955/http://ron.csumb.edu/creeks-salinas-0|archive-date=March 7, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>

The city rests about {{convert|18|m|ft|abbr=off|sp=us}} above sea level, and it is located roughly eight miles from the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The [[Gabilan Mountains|Gabilan]] and [[Santa Lucia Mountains|Santa Lucia]] mountain ranges border the Salinas Valley to the east and to the west, respectively. Both mountain ranges and the Salinas Valley run approximately {{convert|90|mi|km|0}} south-east from Salinas towards [[King City, California|King City]].

The Salinas River runs the length of the Salinas Valley and empties into the Pacific Ocean at the center of the [[Monterey Bay]]. During the summer months the river flows partially underground and it is this extensive underground aquifer that allows for irrigation of cropland in an area without much annual rainfall.

===Climate===
[[File:Main Street Salinas CA December.jpg|alt=Picture of Main Street in Salinas with a vintage car, holiday lights and trees.|thumb|Downtown Salinas in December 2018. Winter months are mild in Salinas.]]
Salinas has cool and moderate temperatures, due to the "natural [[air conditioner]]" that conveys ocean air and fog from the [[Monterey Bay]] to Salinas, while towns to the north and south of Salinas experience hotter summers, as mountains block the ocean air. Thus, Salinas weather is closer to that of the [[Central Coast of California]], rather than that of inland valleys, and thus has a mild [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification|Köppen]] ''Csb'') with typical daily highs ranging from {{convert|62.4|°F}} in December to {{convert|74.7|°F}} in September. The record highest temperature was {{convert|107|°F|0}} on September 2, 2017.<ref name = NOWData/> The record lowest temperature was {{convert|22|°F|0}} on January 12, 1963, and January 13, 2007.

====Airport====
[[Salinas Municipal Airport]] is located on the southeastern boundary of the City of Salinas, {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the city center. It is a general aviation facility occupying {{convert|763|acre|km2|1}}, with two runways serving single and twin engine aircraft and helicopters, as well as an increasing number of turbopropeller and turbine-powered business jets.

The airport has an air traffic control tower in operation twelve hours a day, seven days a week. The airport terminal is located on Mortensen Avenue and houses airport office staff as well as professional offices. Salinas Airport Commissioners agreed to a proposed project that would bring a 100-room hotel, offices and hangars to a vacant lot in front of the Salinas Municipal Airport terminal. The Salinas Jet Center would include a national chain hotel, {{convert|80000|sqft|m2|-3}} of office space, four large complexes combining more offices with airplane hangars and a 24-hour, full-service aircraft fueling station. The project would also include a taxiway to allow planes to access the new hangars.

The airport has full [[Instrument Landing System]] (ILS) and [[VHF omnidirectional range]] (VOR) located on the airport. The ILS has a Medium Intensity Approach Lighting System, with Runway Alignment Indicator Lights. The VOR approach has Runway End Identifier Lights. All but the ILS runway, RWY 31, have Visual Approach Slope Indicators (VASIs).

The airport is the site of the California International Airshow, set annually in the late summer or early autumn. The event draws thousands of visitors to Salinas over its three-day run.
