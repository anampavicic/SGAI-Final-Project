The city has been a major center for [[coal mining]] throughout much of its modern history, and experienced major growth during the [[Soviet Union]] as its coal industry developed. Coal mining remains a significant part of the city's economy.

== Etymology ==
The name ''Karaganda'' is [[etymology|derived from]] "[[caragana]]" bushes (''[[Caragana arborescens]]'', ''Caragana frutex''), which are abundant in the area.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

=== 20th century ===
In the late 1920s, [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Geologist|geologists]] examined the region's coal deposits, prompting Soviet authorities to establish the Karaganda Coal Trust, and plan for the creation of coal mines and a mining town in the area.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=25}} Planners set out to create a dozen coal mines, and drafted blueprints for a city to house an estimated 40,000 workers.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=25}} Coal mining in the area resumed in 1930, and temporary structures were built for miners and their families.<ref name=":0" /> The new area for the city was to the south of the initial mines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}} Initially, Karaganda suffered from an inadequate amount of supplies, and living conditions in the settlement were often poor.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=|pages=25–26}} In 1930, coal production was below expectations.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=26}} In February 1931, the area was connected via [[Rail transport|railroad]], bringing in a wealth of supplies and highly-qualified personnel.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=26}} Later that year, [[NKVD]] officials established the [[Karlag|Karlag Prison]].<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=26}} Upon the establishment of the Karlag Prison, authorities began to import labor into the region en masse.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=26}} During the 1930s, the area experienced rapid growth.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=17}} In 1931, Karaganda was incorporated as a village, and in 1934, was declared a city.<ref name=":0" /> Led by planner [[Alexander Ivanovich Kuznetsov]], [[Comprehensive planning|masters plans]] for Karaganda were laid out from 1934 until 1938.<ref name=":0" /> During the [[Great Purge|Stalinist purges]], peoples from many different nationalities, including [[Germans]], [[Karachays|Karachais]], [[Kalmyks]], [[Chechens]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Greeks]], and [[Crimean Tatars]] were sent to Karlag.<ref name=":0" /> By 1939, Karaganda had a population of about 100,000, about half of which were prisoners.<ref name=":1" />{{Rp|page=17}}

In the 1940s, up to 70% of the city's inhabitants were ethnic [[Germans]].{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Most of the [[Germans of Kazakhstan|ethnic Germans]] were Soviet [[Volga German]]s who were collectively deported to [[Siberia]] and Kazakhstan on [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] order when [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] invaded [[Kresy|Soviet-annexed eastern Poland]] and the Soviet Union proper in 1941.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}} Until the 1950s, many of these deportees were interned in labor camps, often simply because they were of German descent.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}} The population of Karaganda fell by 14% from 1989 to 1999 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union; it was once Kazakhstan's second-largest city after Almaty.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}} Over 100,000 people have since emigrated to [[Germany]].

[[Robert F.

While on the six week trip (e.g., [[Bukhara]], 300 to 1 mosque after Soviet rule),{{Clarify|date=October 2022}} his biographers reported that their delegation was not allowed to visit the city of Karaganda which was one of the sites of the most notorious [[Labor camp|labor camps]] within the confines of the [[Soviet Union]].

==== 1962 electromagnetic pulse incident ====

Karaganda suffered the most severe [[Nuclear electromagnetic pulse|electromagnetic pulse]] effects ever observed when its electrical [[power plant]] was set on fire by currents induced in a {{convert|1000|km|abbr=on}} long shallow buried [[electric power transmission|power cable]] by Soviet Test ‘184’ on 22 October 1962.{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}} The test was part of the [[Soviet Project K nuclear tests]] ([[anti-ballistic missile|ABM System A]] proof tests), and consisted of a 300-[[kiloton]] [[high-altitude nuclear explosion]] at an altitude of {{convert|290|km|abbr=on}} over [[Zhezkazgan]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2023}}

==== Late 20th century ====
Kuznetsov's master plan for the city was intended to accommodate 300,000 inhabitants, which was surpassed by the late 1960s.<ref name=":0" /> This prompted planners to devise a new plan with the goal of accommodating 600,000 people.<ref name=":0" /> By the 1980s, the city's population surpassed 600,000 people, creating the need for further expansion.<ref name=":0" /> In 1983, the Karaganda Circus was constructed, which was criticized for its high cost.<ref name=":0" />

In the early 1990s, Karaganda was briefly considered as a candidate for the capital of the (then) newly independent Republic of Kazakhstan, but its bid was turned down in favour of [[Astana]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Karaganda is located in a steppe area of the [[Kazakh Uplands]] at an elevation of {{convert|546|m|abbr=on}}.

== In popular culture ==
Karaganda was often used as the punchline in a popular joke in the former [[Soviet Union]]. Karaganda is fairly isolated in a vast area of uninhabited [[steppe]], and is thought by many to be "the middle of nowhere". When used in the [[locative case]] (Караганде), the final syllable rhymes with the Russian word for "where" (где), as well as with a Russian obscenity used to answer to an unwanted question "Where?". Thus the exchange: "Где?" — "В Караганде!" ("Where?" — "In Karaganda!").<ref>{{Cite book |last=Мандрикова |first=Г.
