'''Arequipa''' ({{IPA|es|aɾeˈkipa}}; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] and {{langx|qu|Ariqipa}}), also known by its nicknames of ''Ciudad Blanca'' (Spanish for "White City") and ''León del Sur'' (Spanish for "Lion of the South"),<ref>{{Cite book |title=Arequipa, en búsqueda del León perdido |last=Vargas Gutiérrez |first=José Luis |publisher=Paradigma |year=2002 |pages=1 |language=es |volume=2}}</ref> is a city in [[Peru]] and the capital of the eponymous [[Arequipa (province)|province]] and [[department of Arequipa|department]].

Its metropolitan area integrates twenty-one districts, including the foundational central area, which it is the seat of the city government. The city had a nominal GDP of US$9,445 million, equivalent to US$10,277 per capita (US$18,610 per capita PPP) in 2015, making Arequipa the city with the second-highest economic activity in Peru.<ref>{{Cite web |url = http://www.mckinsey.com/mgi/overview/in-the-news/urban-world-app |title = Urban world: What's next? |publisher = McKinsey & Company |date = October 2016 |website = McKinsey Global Institute }}</ref>

Arequipa is also an important industrial and commercial center of Peru,<ref name = "chanfreau40p">Chanfreau, p. 40</ref> and is considered as the second industrial city of the country. Within its industrial activity the manufactured products and the textile production of [[wool]] of camelids.

The city was founded on 15 August 1540, under the name of "Beautiful Villa of Our Lady of the Assumption" in the name of Marquis [[Francisco Pizarro]]. On 22 September 1541, the monarch [[Carlos I of Spain|Carlos V]] ordered that it should be called the "City of Arequipa".

== Etymology ==
A local tradition states that [[Sapa Inca]] [[Mayta Cápac]] received a petition from his subjects to reach the valley of the River Chili. They asked him for permission to stay in the region as they were impressed by the beauty of the landscape and the mild climate. The Inca answered ''"Ari qhipay"'' (Quechua: ''"Yes, stay")''.<ref name="garayar51p">{{harv|Garayar|p=51|2004|sp=sí}}</ref> However, another similar tale states that when the first Europeans arrived to the valley, they pointed at the ground and asked for the name of the land. The local chief, not understanding the question, assumed they were asking for permission to sit down and gave an affirmation, which sounded like "Arequipa".<ref>[[Lev Uspensky]], ''«Имя дома твоего»''</ref>

Chroniclers [[Blas Valera]] and [[Inca Garcilaso de la Vega]] suggested that the name of the city came from an ancient [[Aymara language|Aymara]] phrase, "ari qquepan", supposedly meaning "trumpet sound", in reference to the sound produced from blowing into an empty conch-like seashell.<ref name="palma30p">{{harv|Palma|1893|p=29|sp=sí}}</ref>

Another possible origin of the city's name comes from the [[Aymara language|Aymara]] phrase "qhipaya ari" or "Ari qipa" (from 'ari': acute, sharp or pointed; and 'qhipaya': behind), which translates to "behind the peak", referring to the nearby volcano, [[El Misti|Misti.]]<ref name="Etimologia">[http://www.saludarequipa.gob.pe/epidemiologia/ASIS/Asis2004/ASIS%20PRIMERA%20PARTE%202004.pdf Toponymy "Arequipa"]</ref>

== City symbols ==

=== Flag ===
Historians debate the origin of the crimson flag of the city. By 1940, several historians, most notably Francisco Mostajo and Victor M. Barriga, confirmed the royal origin of the crimson color of the flag, contrary to a blue banner which historian Victor Benavente hypothesized to be the original. This matches the color that local sports organizations use.<ref name="galdos246p">{{harv|Galdós Rodríguez|1997|p=246|sp=sí}}</ref><nowiki> On 2 September 1940, Francisco Mostajo sent a letter to the Mayor of the City to explain his views regarding the color of the Banner of Arequipa, basing his claims on the '</nowiki>''Act of the Oath of King Carlos III'' ''" of'' 11 August 1788. On 23 September of the same year, Father Victor M. Barriga also published an important document in the Catholic newspaper ''El Deber'' that contains a description of the royal standard of Arequipa found in the ''"Act of 3 September 1789".''<ref name="neira354p">{{harv|Neira|Galdos|Malaga|Quiroz|1990|p=354|sp=sí}}</ref>

=== Coat of arms ===
On 22 December 1540, King [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles I of Spain]] elevated Arequipa to the rank of [[city]] by royal decree, awarding it a coat of arms on which a mythical animal carries a banner inscribed with ''Karlos V'' or ''Del Rey.''<ref name="palma30p" />

=== Anthem ===
The city anthem is ''Fourth Centenary Anthem''. Lyrics and music were composed by Emilio Pardo Valle and Aurelio Diaz Espinoza, who won a 1939 contest which the city council organize to dedicate a new anthem. Since then, the song has been sung at all important civic events held in the city.

== History ==

=== Pre-Columbian era ===
[[File:Arequipa, Santa Catalina Monastery en 2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Colonial [[Monastery of Santa Catalina de Siena, Arequipa|Monastery of Santa Catalina de Siena]]]]
The early inhabitants of the modern-day Arequipa area were nomads who relied on [[fishing]] as well as [[hunting]] and [[Hunter–gatherer|gathering]] for survival. Later, pre-Inca cultures [[Domestication|domesticated]] llamas and became [[Sedentism|sedentary]] with the rise of [[agriculture]].<ref name="galdos13p2">{{harv|Galdós Rodríguez|1997|p = 13|sp = sí}}</ref> Terraces used for crop irrigation were built on both sides of the [[Chili River]] valley. The Yarabaya and Chimbe tribes settled in the city's current location, and together with the Cabana and Collagua tribes they developed an agrarian economy in the valley.<ref name="galdos13p2" />

When the [[Sapa Inca|Inca]] [[Mayta Cápac]] arrived in the valley of the Chili river, he didn't build cities. Instead, through the [[mitma]] policy, he forced the resettlement of his subjects to solidify control of existing territories, conduct intelligence duties, and strengthen border enclaves to control unconquered villages.<ref name="galdos14p2">{{harv|Galdós Rodríguez|1997|p = 14|sp = sí}}
</ref> A Hispanic version of the events, detailed by chronicler [[Garcilaso de la Vega (chronicler)|Garcilaso de la Vega]], which has been described as historically inaccurate,<ref name="galdos15p2">{{harv|Galdós Rodríguez|1997|p = 15|sp = sí}}</ref> suggests that around 1170{{dubious|date=December 2022}} Huayna Capac stopped in the Chili River valley with his army, calling the area ''Ari qepay'' which means "Let's stay here." Lands were then distributed among 3,000 families who founded communities such as Yanahuara, Cayma, Tiabaya, Socabaya, and Characato, all of which are districts in Arequipa today.<ref name="garayar50p2">{{harv|Garayar|2004|p = 50|sp = sí}}</ref> After [[Incas in Central Chile|their conquest of Chile]] the Incas resettled part of the population thousands of kilometres away in [[Aconcagua Valley]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Prehistoria de Chile |last=Mostny |first=Grete |publisher=[[Editorial Universitaria]] |year=1983 |edition=6th |location=Santiago de Chile |language=Spanish |chapter= |author-link=Grete Mostny |orig-date=1981|page=156}}</ref>

=== Colonial era ===
On 15 August 1540, Spanish lieutenant [[Garcí Manuel de Carbajal]] named the cluster of [[Native American (Americas)|Native American]] villages in the area "Villa de la Asunción de Nuestra Señora del Valle Hermoso de Arequipa".<ref name="«arellano257p»2">{{harv|Arellano|1988|sp = sí|p = 257}}
</ref> At the time of its foundation, Arequipa already had a city council because Carbajal also led relocation efforts for an existing coastal city named Villa Hermosa de Camana.

</ref>

The city became one of the most known and important in the [[Viceroyalty of Peru]], being second from the capital, [[Lima]]. A town council was organized soon after the city of founded, which was in charge of electing mayors and authorities for the city. The organization was broken during civil wars carried out by rebel groups, leading up to the [[Peruvian War of Independence]]. Since 1553, by order of Viceroy Martín Enríquez de Almanza, the application of the system of insaculation and under this system a mayor "of neighbors" and another "of soldiers" are elected, who were later replaced by the mayor "of neighbors" and "of citizens." 

The [[Basilica Cathedral of Arequipa]] began construction in 1544 but was destroyed due to an earthquake in 1583. The cathedral was rebuilt in 1590 and in 1609, [[Pope Paul V]] created the Arequpa Diocese. The cathedral was complete in 1950. 

One aspect that distinguished Arequipa from other localities in Peru, and [[Lima]], in particular, was the explicit public adherence of the city's ruling classes to the Spanish Crown during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the eighteenth century, with the occurrence of the different indigenous and mestizo movements and rebellions, Arequipa maintained a political balance and closed adherence to the directives coming from the kings of Spain, a phenomenon called "fidelismo" that had as notable defenders Francisco de Paula Quiroz, Mariano de Rivero, Nicólas Fernández, and José Miguel de Lastarria. In the uprising of [[Túpac Amaru II]] he confronted the city with a column of troops that he armed at his expense, and helped destroy the siege of the city of [[La Paz]], which earns it the qualification of "Restoration Province of the Collao". For these services, [[Charles IV of Spain|King Charles IV]] issued a Royal Decree in the city of San Lorenzo on December 5, 1805, in which he ordered her to be called and titled Fidelísima. 

'''Independence'''

Since the Spanish founding of Arequipa, the mostly Spanish population retained heavy loyalty to the Spanish crown, a phenomenon called ''fidelismo.''<ref name="caceres128p2">{{harv|Cáceres-Péfaur|2006|sp = sí|p = 128}}

The city would remain under Spanish control until the Battle of Ayacucho (1824), due to struggles for local political power.<ref name="gadea1p2">{{cite web|publisher = Universidad Católica de Santa María|title = ¿Por qué el Perú es independiente?|url = http://www.ucsm.edu.pe/arequipa/peru6.htm|access-date = 8 November 2012|work = Arequipa al día|date = 23 August 2006|language = es|last = Gadea Aburto|first = Saúl|editor = Arequipa al día|url-status = dead|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110424023502/http://www.ucsm.edu.pe/arequipa/peru6.htm|archive-date = 24 April 2011}}

=== Republican era ===

==== 19th century ====
After independence was proclaimed, the area of the Intendancy of Arequipa was established as a department by a decree of May 26, 1822. During the Congress of 1826 and the Constituent Assembly of 1827, Javier de Luna Pizarro, from Arequipa and Loreto, assumed the presidency. Under [[Simón Bolívar]], Arequipa established itself as a staunch opponent of the dictatorial tendencies of the Liberator after his triumph at [[Ayacucho]]. Prominent Arequipeños such as Domingo Tristán, Benito Lazo and Gualberto Valdivia openly spoke out against the Bolivarian constitution for life. It was during this period that the Academia Lauretana promoted the creation of the Colegio Nacional de la Independencia Americana and the [[National University of San Agustín]] in 1827.[[File:Plaza de Armas Ciudad de Arequipa.jpg|left|thumb|Plaza de Armas of Arequipa]]
Arequipa's strategic location at the crossroads of the colonial silver trade route and that of the post-independence wool trade route allowed the city to emerge as an administrative, commercial, and industrial hub.<ref name="chanfreau40p" /> In the decade following Peru's 1821 declaration of independence from Spain, society in Arequipa and Peru at-large was in transition.<ref name="ponce51p">{{harv|Ponce|1960|p=51|sp=sí}}</ref> Thus, Arequipa not only became the birthplace of notable political figures<ref name="cotler97p">{{harv|Cotler|2009|p=97|sp=sí}}</ref> but also the site of key political movements<ref name="cotler93p">{{harv|Cotler|2009|p=93|sp=sí}}</ref> that helped defend the legal and economic stability of the city;<ref name="bethell402p">{{harv|Bethell|1991|p=402|sp=sí}}</ref> thus elevating Arequipa to a status second only to its rival city and the capital, Lima.<ref name="ponce53p">{{harv|Ponce|1960|p=53|sp=sí}}</ref>

On 13 January 1835, President [[Luis José de Orbegoso]] moved his government from Lima to Arequipa by presidential decree.<ref name="neira438p2">{{harv|Neira|Galdos|Malaga|Quiroz|1990|p = 438|sp = sí}}
</ref> Meanwhile, in Lima, General [[Felipe Santiago Salaverry]] named himself Supreme Chief of the Republic, arguing that the country was leaderless as Orbegoso was outside the capital.<ref name="congreso.gob.pe2">[[transport|Decree assuming command of the Republic General Felipe Santiago Salaverry, 25 February 1835]].
</ref> Orbegoso then sought support from Bolivian president [[Andrés de Santa Cruz]] against the claims of [[Felipe Santiago Salaverry|Salaverry.]] On 4 February 1836, Salaverry's Army of Reunification won a battle at Uchumayo.

On 31 August 1882, following the occupation of Lima during the [[War of the Pacific]], President [[Lizardo Montero Flores]] arrived in Arequipa and declared it the capital of Peru, which changed back to Lima after its occupation ended in 1823.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title = Wars of the Americas|last = Marley|first = David|publisher = ABC-CLIO|year = 2008|pages = 889|volume = 2}}</ref> On 22 April 1883, Montero installed a National Congress<ref name="neira532p2">{{harv|Neira|Galdos|Malaga|Quiroz|1990|p = 532|sp = sí}}

Four days later, with support from city authorities, Chilean troops occupied Arequipa until August 1884.<ref name=":0" />

Montero's government had a "National Congress" installed on April 22, 1883 in the cloisters of the Colegio Independencia and the Universidad Nacional de San Agustín, a military backing made up of all males between the ages of 20 and 60They made up an army of 4,000 men and 8,000 to 10,000 National Guardsmenand significant economic support based on the quotas and expenditures imposed on both the economic elite and the various southern agricultural districts.

==== 20th century ====
The Republican Era brought many improvements to the city's infrastructure and economy. The Southern Railroad built by [[Henry Meiggs]] connected Arequipa with the port city of Mollendo in 1871 and with [[Cusco|Cuzco]] and [[Juliaca]] in 1876.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Railroads in Peru: How Important Were They?|last = Zegarra|first = Luis Felipe|date = 2011|journal = Desarrollo y Sociedad|doi = 10.13043/dys.68.7|volume = 68|issue = 68|pages = 213–259|doi-access = free}}</ref> In 1908, the first telegraph system in the Arequipa region connected [[Mollendo]], Arequipa and Vitor. In 1914, the city built its first drinking water supply system as well as an aqueduct. In 1940, the city's international airport, [[Rodríguez Ballón International Airport]], named after the Peruvian pilot from Arequipa, Rodríguez Ballón, was opened.

Politically, Arequipa was no stranger to the tumults of the century. On August 22, 1930, [[Luis Miguel Sánchez Cerro]] assumed control, forcing the departure of President [[Augusto B. Leguía]]. In a similar twist, on October 27, 1948, General Manuel A. Odría established a junta government after deposing President José Luis Bustamante y Rivero. But beyond the military movements, Arequipa also shone as a cradle of civic resistance. Two demonstrations against the Odría regime are especially noteworthy: one in June 1950 and the other that dominated the scene in December 1955.

==== 21st century ====
In 2000, the historic center of Arequipa was declared a [[World Heritage Site]] by [[UNESCO]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1016|title = Historical Centre of the City of Arequipa|access-date = 17 September 2015|website = World Heritage List|publisher = UNESCO}}</ref> However, on 23 June 2001, an [[2001 southern Peru earthquake|8.4-magnitude earthquake]] damaged several historical buildings.<ref>[[tax|The highest magnitude earthquakes since 1900]].</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://khatati.igp.gob.pe/cns/publi/simposium02/pdf_simposium02/sgp_ber2_tave.PDF|title = Cuantificación del Tamaño del Terremoto de Arequipa del 23 June 2001|access-date = 18 August 2012|author = Tavera, Hernando|year = 2011|language = es|archive-date = 20 January 2010|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100120020910/http://khatati.igp.gob.pe/cns/publi/simposium02/pdf_simposium02/sgp_ber2_tave.PDF}}</ref> This resulted in more precautions and safety measures to be conducted, to ensure the safety of the city and its history. Around the 2010s, the city experienced a large economic growth, partially due to its mining sector, being near [[copper]] reserves. The city has also tackled socio-environmental challenges, such as water management and urban planning. Arequipa's Urban Development Plan 2025 is a reflection of these efforts. The urban transport system has evolved, including the modernization of buses. Sustainable mobility has also been a concern, with the incorporation of electric buses and the promotion of the use of non-motorized vehicles.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===

The city is located at an average elevation of {{convert|2328|m}} above sea level, with the lowest part of the city at {{convert|2041|m}} above sea level in the area called Huayco [[Uchumayo District|Uchumayo]] while the highest is located at {{convert|2810|m}} above sea level.

The central part of the city is split by the Chili River from north to south; to the north and east of Arequipa are the Andes Mountains, while to the south and west are sub-ranges of the Andes. The valley of Arequipa strategically links the coastal and highland regions of southern Peru.<ref name="gutierrez17p">{{harv|Gutiérrez|p=17|1994|sp=sí}}</ref>

A series of volcanic cones dominates the city skyline &ndash; [[El Misti|Misti]] and the extinct volcanic groups [[Pichu Pichu]] and [[Chachani]]. The western slopes of the Andes feature thick, extensive layers of volcanic lava.<ref name="regional19p">Regional Government of Arequipa. "Analysis of the state and of the determinants of health", p. 19.</ref>

=== Climate ===
[[File:Volcán Misti desde Arequipa, Perú, 2015-08-02, DD 02.JPG|alt=|thumb|upright=1.3|View of the [[Misti]] volcano, and the valley of the Chili River.]]
The climate of the city is predominantly dry in [[winter]], [[autumn]] and [[Spring (season)|spring]] due to low atmospheric humidity and a level of precipitation corresponding to that of a [[desert climate]] (''BWk'', according to the [[Köppen climate classification]]). On average, Arequipa has 300 days of sunshine each year. Typically, temperatures neither exceed {{convert|25|°C|0}} nor drop below {{convert|5|°C|0}}. The wet season lasts from December to March and is marked by the presence of clouds in the afternoon and low rainfall. In winter (June and July), the temperature drops to an average of {{convert|6|°C|0}}.

The average relative humidity is 46%, with an average high of 70% in the summer season and a minimum average of 27% during autumn, winter and spring, according to data from the Goyeneche Hospital weather station.<ref name=":1">{{Cite book|title = "Gesta Zonal de Aire, Arequipa" (PDF) (in Spanish). Plan a limpiar el aire.|publisher = Consejo Nacional del Ambiente}}</ref>

The mountainous topography surrounding the Chili River valley affects low-pressure fronts and local winds. These winds occur mainly in the early morning and the evening. Mountain breezes typically flow northeast, and valley breezes typically flow southwest. Wind velocity fluctuates between 1.5&nbsp;m/s and 2.5&nbsp;m/s.<ref name=":1" />

=== Solar radiation ===
[[Sunlight|Solar radiation]] in Arequipa ranges from 850 to 950 ''W/m <sup>2</sup>'' (watts per square meter), one of the highest levels of radiation in South America and the highest recorded in Peru. Arequipa's proximity to the [[Atacama Desert]] and [[pollution]] contribute to the higher levels of radiation.<ref name="conam21p">National Environmental Council. "To clear the air", p. 21.</ref>

=== Cityscape ===

On 15 August 1540, the Spanish plan for Arequipa resembled a checkerboard made of fifty-six blocks, each one of "400 Castilian feet" (111.40 meters) per side.<ref name="neira244p2" /> Each block consisted of four or eight land lots, which were distributed according to the status of the new owners. Over time, some religious institutions would occupy an entire block as did the Convent of Santa Catalina and the San Francisco Monastery.<ref name="diagnostico12p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa. "Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 12.</ref>

Urban expansion occurred at the expense of the countryside, and this phenomenon has accelerated in recent decades. Arequipa expanded east of the historic center, and new avenues such as Parra Boulevard and Siglo Veinte Avenue were built to connect the historic center with newer neighborhoods, such as Vallecito (developed in the 1940s)<ref name="vallecito">{{cite web |url=http://www.mariorommelarce.com/portal/?p=439 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130128092438/http://www.mariorommelarce.com/portal/?p=439 |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 January 2013 |title=Los Barrios: Su historía, costumbre y tradiciones |access-date=28 October 2009 |author=Mario Rommel Arce }}</ref> or with already existing towns like Yanahuara, which were absorbed by the city's expansion. Shantytowns appeared in the districts of Miraflores, Barrio Obrero, and Jacinto Ibanez. A permanent marketplace was built in a vacant lot previously occupied by the San Camilo Monastery. The Goyeneche Hospital was built between 1905 and 1910. Two theaters (Municipal and Ateneo), a hotel (Hotel de Turistas), a public library and the campus of San Agustin University were other city developments of the early 20th century. Housing projects and new neighborhoods were also built, such as Cuarto Centenario and Selva Alegre.<ref name="diagnostico14p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa. "Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 14.</ref>

In the late 1950s, the city rapidly grew, especially in peripheral areas.<ref name="diagnostico15p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa. "Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 15.</ref> Around this time, industrial operations located in areas of Barrio del Solar and Barrio Obrero,<ref name="diagnostico24p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa.

"Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 6.</ref> Some educational institutions, such as the National University of San Agustin, moved out of the city center to more spacious land lots in peripheral areas to accommodate their growing facilities. Residential zones also developed in peripheral suburbs, causing the main function of the city center to be a tourist and business district.<ref name="diagnostico15p" />

According to the 2007 [[Peru 2007 Census|census]], 70% of the Department of Arequipa's total population and 90% of its urban population lives in Arequipa city proper. The city is the second most populous in Peru after the capital, Lima.

In an early census in 1796, Arequipa had a population of 37,241, of which 22,207 (59.6%) were Spaniards, 5,929 (15.9%) were Native Americans, 4,908 (13.2%) were [[mestizo]]s, 2,487 (6.7%) were [[castizo]]s, and 1,710 (4.6%) were Africans.<ref name="gutierrez83p">{{harv|Gutiérrez|p=83|1994|sp=sí}}</ref> Population growth accelerated from 1.1% growth between 1876 and 1917 to 3.3% growth between 1940 and 1960.<ref name="gutierrez226p">{{harv|Gutiérrez|p=226|1994|sp=sí}}</ref>

The city's population increased from 80,000 in 1940 to 158,000 in 1961.<ref name="gutierrez226p" /> An earthquake in 1958 and a drought in the [[Altiplano]] caused a rise in migration, urbanization, and peripheral city growth (suburbs and shantytowns) that continues to this day.<ref name="diagnostico15p" /> The rearrangement and improvement of urban space after the earthquakes also helped cause Arequipa's population to grow twofold in a decade.<ref name="gutierrez231p">{{harv|Gutiérrez|p=231|1994|sp=sí}}</ref> The population increased from 158,000 in 1961 to 309,000 in 1972 to almost 500,000 in 1983.

== Society and Culture ==

===Regionalism===
Arequipa, unlike other big Peruvian cities with mestizo and indigenous features, has been labeled as a "Spanish island in an indigenous sea" and because of its status as a "natural oasis".<ref name="love4p">{{harv|Love|1995|p=4|sp=sí}}</ref> Culture in Arequipa is marked by the regionalism of its inhabitants; in fact, unlike other regional sentiments within Peru, Arequipa's regionalism was connected to the fight against centralism. This proud [[Regionalism (international relations)|regionalism]], expressed in numerous insurrections or revolutions, has earned the city the nickname "Ciudad Caudillo" (Warlord City). As Peruvian historian [[Jorge Basadre]] argued, "Arequipa is a gun pointed at the heart of Lima", alluding to the rivalry between the two cities.<ref name="guillemete3p">{{harv|Guillemette|2010|p = 3|sp = sí}}</ref>

===Language===
An element of culture in Arequipa City is its Spanish dialect which incorporates a distinctive rhythmic way of speaking, which usually elongates the last vowel of the final word in each sentence. A distinctive feature of this dialect is the "[[voseo]]",<ref name="guajardo15p">{{harv|Guajardo Castro|2009|p=15|sp=sí}}</ref><ref name="carricaburo36p">{{harv|Carricaburo|1997|p=36|sp=si}}</ref> that is, the use in Spanish language of the pronoun 'vos' to replace the use of 'tú' or 'usted' (all corresponding to the English 'you'). [[Peruvian Spanish|In Peru]], the voseo is sometimes heard only in rural areas except in Arequipa, where that way of speaking is heard in both rural and urban areas.<ref name="voseoRAE">{{cite web |url=http://www.rae.es/dpd/?key=voseo |title=Diccionario Panhispánico de Dudas |access-date=2 February 2009 |author=Real Academia Española de la Lengua |date=October 2005}}</ref> Another dialect from the city surroundings, called ''[[loncco]]'', has been largely lost due to migration from other provinces and the standardization of Spanish language by the media. However, there are contests in schools which promote the writing of poems in the loncco dialect.[[File:Vargas Losa Göteborg Book Fair 2011b.jpg|thumb|[[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (Arequipa, Peru, 28 March 1936). Nobel Prize in Literature 2010|240x240px]]

===Literature===
Literature in Arequipa has a long tradition and many of the city's writers have gained national and international recognition. During the Spanish colonial period, only the works of Lorenzo de Llamosas survived.<ref>{{Cite book|title = La poesía en Arequipa en el siglo XX. Estudio y antología|last = Cornejo|first = Jorge|publisher = UNSA|year = 1990|pages = Estudio preliminar}}</ref> In the nineteenth century, the poetry and fables of [[Mariano Melgar]] incorporated patriotic and romantic themes. Other notable writers of Arequipa in that century are Benito Bonifaz, [[Jorge Polar]] and [[María Nieves y Bustamante]], among others. In the twentieth century, [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] is the most recognized of the Arequipan writers in Peru and abroad, winner of [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 2010, author of novels like ''[[The Green House]]'' (1966), ''[[Aunt Julia and the Scriptwriter]]'' (1977), among others. Other writers of the 20th century were the poets Percy Gibson, Cesar Rodriguez Atahualpa, and Oswaldo Reynoso.

===Art and photography===
Some of the most detailed photographic records of 19th- and 20th-century Peru are found in the works of the [[Vargas Brothers Art Studio]]. Open from 1912 to 1958, the studio captured more diversity of Peruvian culture than any other photography studio at the time.<ref name="Castro">{{cite web|last1=Castro |first1=Fernando |title=The Vargas Brothers of Arequipa |url=http://www.hcponline.org/publications/spot-issues/summer-2007/vargas-brothers |website=Houston Center For Photography Online |publisher=Houston Center For Photography |access-date=6 July 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629153037/http://www.hcponline.org/publications/spot-issues/summer-2007/vargas-brothers |archive-date=29 June 2016 |location=Houston, Texas |date=30 November 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Most known for their nocturnals and portrait photography of women, their photographic archive, which is privately held by descendants of the studio's founders and brothers Carlos and Miguel Vargas, have been restored and digitized.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson |first1=Patricia C. |title=How a lost Peruvian work made its way to Houston |url=http://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/How-a-lost-Peruvian-work-made-its-way-to-Houston-1906785.php#photo-1486517 |access-date=6 July 2017 |newspaper=[[The Houston Chronicle]] |date=3 December 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706193159/http://www.chron.com/entertainment/article/How-a-lost-Peruvian-work-made-its-way-to-Houston-1906785.php |archive-date=6 July 2017 |location=Houston, Texas |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many international showings of their works, have brought recognition to the studio and the way of life their images have preserved.<ref name= "Castro" />

"Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 39.</ref> of which 500 are categorized as heritage properties, generally have been built in the nineteenth century, on the site of earlier colonial buildings destroyed by the earthquake of 1868. The houses, usually made in [[ashlar]], are characterized by semi-circular arches and vaulted ceilings. Ashlar structures always have thick walls: 1 to 1.5 meters for rooms, 2 meters for churches. Through the use of lime mortar, the walls are shown homogeneous image that is reinforced with brick vaults or ashlar that are justified in the rarity of the wood.<ref name="diagnostico40p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa. "Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 40.</ref>

In the city is a stylistic school called "School Arequipa" of crucial importance in the region and whose influence reached Potosi. This school is characterized by profuse decoration planiform textilográfica and the open spaces and the design and size of their covers, which differ in these aspects of Cuzco and Lima covers.<!-- The work "San Cristobal Sebastian 2009" is undefined.

The architecture in the historic center is characterized by the prominence of ashlar, the use of which begins in the last third of the 16th century. This volcanic stone, white or pink exceptionally soft, lightweight, and weatherproof, emerged as a seismic structural solution. The ashlar was unable to take the early years, except for the covers of the main church and some houses. The original city was built with adobe, masonry, sticks and straw roofs or mud pie. Houses of this type were made until the nineteenth century and were common in the eighteenth century, some remain in the original district of San Lazaro. Later came the brick and tile houses with tile found in the Monastery of Santa Catalina. The cataclysm of 1582 settled these systems and raised the earthquake reconstruction. Then came the ashlar as prime structural solution.<ref name="diagnostico18p">Provincial Municipality of Arequipa. "Diagnosis of the historic center of Arequipa", p. 18.</ref>

== Transport ==

=== Road ===
[[File:Aerial View, Arequipa, La Marina.jpg|thumb|left|Interchange on La Marina Avenue.|alt=|240x240px]]
Arequipa's urban road network has a radiocentric structure with four main avenues: Avenida Ejército, Avenida Jesus, Avenida Alcides Carrion and Avenida Parra; which allow the movement of the population between the intermediate and peripheral areas and the downtown. These avenues are connected, in turn, by other avenues such as Avenida Venezuela, Avenida La Marina, Avenida Salaverry, Avenida Cáceres, among others, which almost form a ring around the downtown. Other avenues such as: Avenida Cayma, Avenida Goyeneche, and Avenida Dolores link the suburbs and nearby districts with downtown Arequipa. Interchanges such as the one at Avenida La Marina and another one at Avenida Caceres help to relieve urban traffic. A road of 40&nbsp;km approximately, which goes through the district of [[Uchumayo District|Uchumayo]], connects Arequipa to the [[Pan-American Highway]] and coastal cities; another road goes through the district of [[Yura District|Yura]], connecting Arequipa to other cities in the southern highlands like Puno and Cuzco.

Public transit in Arequipa is currently operated by small private companies. In 2014, a [[rapid transit|metro]] system was proposed by Peru's then-[[Ministry of Transport and Communications (Peru)|minister for transport]] José Gallardo.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://andina.pe/ingles/noticia-arequipa-to-be-second-city-in-peru-to-get-metro-system-521783.aspx|title= Arequipa to be second city in Peru to get metro system|website=[[Andina (news agency)|Andina]]|date=3 September 2014|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>

The railway network system has been operating in Arequipa since 1871{{cn|date=September 2023}}, and enables communication between the coast and the mountains and different levels of progress and expansion of population centers located in its path. The system consists of the lines Cusco-Puno-Arequipa and Arequipa-Mollendo. It is of great strategic importance in the multimodal communication system in the southern macro region{{cn|date=September 2023}}, since it is the most effective and economical way to transport heavy loads over long distances.

=== Public ===
''Terrapuerto Internacional Arequipa'' is a bus terminal located in the district of Jacobo Hunter. There, several bus companies offer land travel routes to regional and national destinations within Peru and to international destinations such as [[La Paz, Honduras|La Paz]], [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago de Chile]], [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]] and [[Buenos Aires]].
