'''Tabuk''', officially the '''City of Tabuk''' ({{langx|ilo|Siudad ti Tabuk}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Tabuk}}), is a 5th class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] and capital of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Kalinga (province)|Kalinga]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 121,033 people making it the most populous in the province.{{PH census|current}}

==Etymology==
The term ''Tabuk'' comes from the word ''Tobog'' which refers to a living stream that flows from Sitio Paligatto in Barangay Balawag to the Chico River. The lands passed by this watercourse were also known as Tobog.<ref>{{Cite web |title=ECOLOGICAL PROFILE |url=https://tabukcity.gov.ph/mandate-vision-mission-service-pledge-duplicate-5120/ |access-date=June 20, 2024 |website=City of Tabuk}}</ref> ''Tabuk'' arose from misunderstanding letter ''G'' for ''C'' (Tobo''<u>g</u>'' to Tobo''<u>c</u>'') and letter ''A'' for letter ''O'', resulting in T''<u>a</u>''boc. Finally, in later years, they preferred to spell the letters ''oc'' as ''uk'', resulting in the current Tab''<u>uk</u>''.

==History==
===Early history===
Tabuk was previously known as the "Valley of Gamonangs" after the [[Kalinga (province)|Kalinga]] tribe that ruled Northern Kalinga centuries ago, according to one of the early Spanish missionaries. They lived in the huge valleys and densely forested plains between the Chico and [[Cagayan River]], and their epic military exploits are recounted in the Kalinga Ullalim. According to historical records, they repelled every attempt by the Spaniards to lodge their claims in the alley. Kalinga owes them the fact that it was never subjected to foreign rule.

Repopulation started just before the [[World War I|First World War]]. The American government dispatched six volunteer pioneers from Sitio Tobog and Lubuagan to repopulate the area. The Lubuagan locals died from [[malaria]], leaving only Tobog newcomers to cultivate the soil in Laya. They were then joined by their cousins from Tobog. Between 1922 and 1923, the second wave of settlers arrived from Bontoc. They then set up a colony at Bantay. Another group from Bontoc and [[Cervantes, Ilocos Sur]], was taken to Tuga and given the required farm implements, such as mosquito nets and kitchen utensils. They were later joined by migrants from [[La Union]].

====Establishment====
The Bureau of Land Survey Party arrived in the early 1930s, ushering in a new era for the community. Tabuk was ruled by four groups of municipal executives before becoming a legal municipality on June 16, 1950, under a congressional act. ''Republic Act No. 533'', which was approved on June 16, 1950, turned the former municipal district of Tabuk into a regular municipality.<ref name=PhilLaw>{{cite web|title=R.A. No. 533: An Act to Convert the Municipal District of Tabuk, Sub-province of Kalinga, Mountain Province, into a Regular Municipality to be known as the Municipality of Tabuk|url=http://philippinelaw.info/statutes/ra533.html|website=PhilippineLaw.info|access-date=January 4, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104162709/http://philippinelaw.info/statutes/ra533.html|archive-date=January 4, 2015}}</ref>

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
{{Hatnote|For further information, see [[League of Cities of the Philippines v. COMELEC]].}}
Tabuk became the Cordillera's second city after [[Baguio]] on June 23, 2007, when 17,060 voters ratified ''Republic Act No. 9404''.
On November 18, 2008, the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines|Supreme Court]] voted 6‚Äì5 to revert Tabuk, among other 15 cities', status back to municipalities. However, on December 21, 2009, the court reversed its first decision, returning Tabuk and the 15 other municipalities back to cities again. It contended that these cities were not covered by Republic Act 9009 ‚Äì the law enacted in June 2001 that increased the income requirement for cities from P20 million to P100 million ‚Äì as proven by transcripts of Senate debates while crafting RA 9009.

But on August 24, 2010, the court made a reversal again, reinstating its November 2008 decision, making Tabuk and the other 15 cities regular municipalities again. It concluded that the [[Philippine legal codes|Local Government Code]] as amended by RA 9009 should be followed, without exception.

Finally, on February 15, 2011, Tabuk and the 15 municipalities became cities again after the court made a third reversal. This time the court acknowledged, among others, that the 16 cityhood laws amended RA 9009, effectively amending the [[Philippine legal codes|Local Government Code]] itself.

After six years of legal battles, in its board resolution, the [[League of Cities of the Philippines]] acknowledged and recognized the cityhood of Tabuk and 15 other cities.

==Geography==
Tabuk is bordered by [[Pinukpuk]] in the north, [[Rizal, Kalinga|Rizal]] in the east, [[Quezon, Isabela]] in the southeast, [[Paracelis]] in [[Mountain Province]], and [[Tanudan]] in the south, and [[Lubuagan]] and [[Pasil]] in the west. It is {{convert|548|km}} from Manila (the capital) through the [[Cagayan Valley Road]] and {{convert|296.8|km}} from Baguio City (the country's summer capital) via [[Santiago‚ÄìTuguegarao Road|Santiago‚ÄìTuguegarao]], and [[Benguet‚ÄìNueva Vizcaya Road|Benguet‚ÄìNueva Vizcaya]] roads.

As of 2007, Tabuk is the only city in [[Kalinga (province)|Kalinga]], located in the eastern part of the Central Cordillera Mountain Range. It is widely regarded as the [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera]]'s rice granary due to its extensive agricultural area, which produces enormous quantities of rice that is distributed to other areas. For the past two decades, it has produced exceptional farmers on a national scale.

===Barangays===

The City of Tabuk is politically subdivided into 43 [[barangay]]s. These barangays are headed by elected officials: [[Barangay Captain]], [[Sangguniang Barangay|Barangay Council]], whose members are called [[Barangay Kagawad|Barangay Councilors]]. All are elected every three years.

== Economy ==
{{PH poverty incidence}}

<!--Input text on Tabuk's economy -->

The road networks connecting Tabuk to the [[Cagayan Valley]] and [[Baguio]] via [[Bontoc, Mountain Province|Bontoc]] attracted additional residents and investments, accelerating the economic development of the city. The economy is entirely agro-based, and the Chico River Irrigation System's completion accelerated its growth even more. The city is also suggested as the location of the Cordillera's Regional Agro-Industrial Center. This is projected to help Tabuk become the region's leading agri-industrial metropolis.
