'''Murree''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], {{Langx|ur|{{nq|مری}}}}) is a [[mountain resort]] city, located in the [[Galyat]] region of the [[Pir Panjal Range]], within the [[Murree District]] of [[Punjab, Pakistan]]. It forms the outskirts of the [[Islamabad-Rawalpindi metropolitan area]], and is about {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on}} northeast of [[Islamabad]]. It has average altitude of {{convert|2291|m|ft|0}}. The British built this town during their rule to escape the scorching heat in the plains of Punjab during the summer.<ref name=Tribune>{{Cite news|url=https://tribune.com.pk/story/630567/a-british-town-in-the-hills-book-on-murree-launched/|title=A British town in the hills: Book on Murree launched|newspaper= The Express Tribune (newspaper)|date=2013-11-12|language=en-US|access-date=16 October 2021}}</ref><ref name=GS/>

Construction of the town was started in 1851 on the hill of Murree as a [[sanatorium]] for [[British troops]]. The permanent town of Murree was constructed in 1853 and the church was consecrated shortly thereafter. One main road was established, commonly referred to even in modern times, as the "Mall Road". Murree was the summer headquarters of the colonial [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] Government until 1876 when it was moved to [[Shimla]].{{sfnp|Chisholm|1911}}<ref name=GS/>

Murree became a popular tourist station for British citizens of the [[British Raj]]. Several prominent Britons were born here including [[Bruce Bairnsfather]], [[Francis Younghusband]], [[Reginald Dyer]]<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://www.world66.com/asia/southasia/pakistan/murree/history|title=Murree Culture {{!}} Murree History|website=www.world66.com|access-date=2016-10-29}}</ref> and [[Joanna Kelley]].<ref>{{Cite ODNB|title=Kelley [née Beadon], Joanna Elizabeth (1910–2003), prison administrator|url=https://www.oxforddnb.com/view/10.1093/ref:odnb/9780198614128.001.0001/odnb-9780198614128-e-89897|access-date=2020-06-25|year = 2004|language=en|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/89897}}</ref> During the colonial era, access to commercial establishments was restricted for non-Europeans.

Murree, or ''Marhee'' as it was then called, was first identified as a potential hill station by Major [[James Abbott (Indian Army officer)|James Abbott]] in 1847.{{efn|name="abott"}}

The town's early development was in 1851 by the President of the Punjab Administrative Board, [[Henry Lawrence (Indian Army officer)|Sir Henry Lawrence]].{{efn|name="abott"|The earliest British discovery of Murree, like many of the adjacent hill resorts in the [[Galyat]] range of the [[Hazara region|Hazara]] region, was first made by Major [[James Abbott (Indian Army officer)|James Abbott]] in 1847. Please see [[Charles Allen (writer)|Charles Allen]] ''Soldier Sahibs: The Men who made the North West Frontier'' London: Abacus Books, 2001 p. 141, {{ISBN|0-349-11456-0}}; and ''Journals of Honoria Lawrence'' eds. J. Lawrence and A. Widdiwis, London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1980 edition. For an account of Abbott's early time in Hazara and the founding of [[Abbottabad]], see Omer Tarin and SD Najumddin, "Five Early Military Graves in the Old Christian Cemetery, Abbottabad, Pakistan, 1853–1888", in ''The Kipling Journal'' (ISSN 0023-1738) Vol 84, No 339, p.35-52}} It was originally established as a [[sanatorium]] for British troops garrisoned on the Afghan frontier.{{sfnp|Chisholm|1911}} Officially, the municipality was created in 1850.{{sfnp|Imperial Gazetteer of India|1909}}<ref name=GS/>

The permanent town of Murree was constructed at Sunnybank in 1853. The church was sanctified in May 1857, and the main road, Jinnah Road, originally known as Mall Road and still commonly referred to as "The Mall"), was built. The most significant commercial establishments, the Post Office, general merchants with European goods, tailors and a millinery, were established opposite the church. Until 1947, access to Mall Road was restricted for "natives" (non-Europeans).

In the summer of 1857, a rebellion against the British broke out. The local tribes of Murree and [[Hazara region|Hazara]], including the [[Dhund Abbasis]] and others, attacked the depleted British Army garrison in Murree; however, the tribes were ultimately overcome by the British and capitulated.{{sfnp|Lee|2001}} From 1873 to 1875, Murree was the summer headquarters of the Punjab local government;{{sfnp|Imperial Gazetteer of India|1909}} after 1876 the headquarters were moved to [[Shimla]].{{sfnp|Chisholm|1911}}

The railway connection with [[Lahore]], the capital of the Punjab Province, via Rawalpindi, made Murree a popular resort for Punjab officials, and the villas and other houses erected for the accommodation of English families gave it a European aspect. The houses crowned the summit and sides of an irregular ridge, the neighboring hills were covered during the summer with encampments of British troops, while the station itself was filled with European visitors from the plains and travelers to Kashmir. It was connected with Rawalpindi by a service [[Tanga (carriage)|tangas]].{{sfnp|Imperial Gazetteer of India|1909}}

It was described in the ''[[Rawalpindi Gazetteer|Gazetteer of Rawalpindi District]]'', 1893–94 as follows:{{citation needed|date=July 2019}}

<blockquote>The sanatorium of Murree lies in north latitude 33° 54′ 30″ and east longitude 73° 26′ 30″, at an elevation of {{Convert|7517|ft|m}} above sea level, and contained a standing population of 1,768 inhabitants, which was, however, enormously increased during the [May–November] season by the influx of visitors and their attendant servants and shopkeepers.  It is the most accessible hill station in the Punjab, being distant from Rawalpindi only a five hours' journey by tonga dak. Magnificent views are to be obtained in the spring and autumn of the snow crowned mountains of Kashmir; and gorgeous sunset and cloud effects seen daily during the rains [July–August]. Part of the station, especially the Kashmir end, are also well wooded and pretty.</blockquote>

In 1901, the permanent population of the town was 1,844; if summer visitors had been included this could have been as high as 10,000.{{sfnp|Chisholm|1911}}

In early January 2022, [[2022 Murree snowstorm|over 20 people died]] trying to reach the town during a [[snowstorm]].

==Administration==
[[File:Murree Urban UC.svg|thumb|left|300px|Location of the Union Council within the Murree region.]]'''Murree''', ([[Urdu language|Urdu]]: ضِلع مری) is a district of the [[Rawalpindi Division]] in the northernmost part of the [[Pakistan|Pakistani]] province of [[Punjab, Pakistan|Punjab]]. It has two [[Tehsil|tehsils]], [[Kotli Sattian Tehsil|Kotli Sattian]] and [[Murree Tehsil|Murree]]. In March 2022,  the Punjab Government upgraded the administrative status of Murree by posting Hassan Waqar Cheema as the first Additional Deputy Commissioner (ADC). Its status was updated from tehsil to that of a district in October 2022 after the formal appointment of a Deputy Commissioner in November 2022. 

However, the caretaker Punjab Government reversed the status of District in February 2023. The Lahore High Court struck down the move after which the additional charge of the Deputy Commissioner was given to the Rawalpindi Deputy Commissioner.  

In September 2023, the Punjab Government posted a Deputy Commissioner in Murree. Agha Zaheer Abbas Sherazi was posted as the second ever Deputy Commissioner on 26 September 2023. The elected government post February 2024 elections decided to stick with the upgraded status of Murree considering its pivotal importance for the tourism industry.

For administrative purposes, the military areas of Murree are divided into two separate [[cantonment]]s, Murree Gali Cantonment and Murree Hills Cantonment.<ref name=GS>[https://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/pakistan/cantt-murree-hills.htm Murree Hills Cantonment] GlobalSecurity.org website, Retrieved 16 October 2021</ref> Murree houses the headquarters of the [[12th Infantry Division (Pakistan)|12th Infantry Division]] of the [[Pakistan Army]], several educational and training institutions, and a [[Combined Military Hospitals|combined military hospital]] established to serve Murree and adjoining garrisons.

The [[Pakistan Air Force]] also maintains a base at Lower Topa, near [[Patriata]], with its own military boarding school for boys, [[PAF Public School Lower Topa]].

During the British Raj, in the hot season Murree was the headquarters of the Lieutenant General of the [[Northern Command (India)|Northern Command]]. The Commissioner of the Rawalpindi Division and the Deputy Commissioner of Rawalpindi also resided here during part of the season, for which period an Assistant Commissioner was placed in charge of the subdivision consisting of Murree Tehsil. The site was selected in 1850 almost immediately after the annexation of the province, and building operations commenced at once. In 1851 temporary accommodation was provided for a detachment of troops; and in 1853 permanent barracks were erected. The regular garrison generally consisted of two mountain batteries and one battalion of infantry.
