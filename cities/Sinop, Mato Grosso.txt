==Origin==
In the early 1970s, a company, Sinop Terras, started the construction of a city in northern Mato Grosso, on a land tract called Gleba Celeste, divided into 5 lots. The construction of Sinop resembles the construction of Brasilia, which occurred some 10 years earlier, because it was built very quickly (in a few years). Colonization  initially was made by Paraná settlers, but soon, the developing new city attracted Brazilians from all regions of the country, especially from the South, North and Northeast of Brazil.{{citation needed|date=March 2023}}

==Trajectory==
In 1948 Ênio Pipino and João Pedro Moreira de Carvalho founded '''S'''ociedade '''I'''mobiliária '''No'''roeste do '''P'''araná (Northwestern Paraná Real Estate Society), better known as Sinop Terras S / A. In 1954 Pipino goes to the State, where he founded several cities. In the early 1970s, the north of Mato Grosso was scarcely populated. An area of 645 hectares called Gleba Celeste (which originated Sinop) initiates colonization, situated 500&nbsp;km from Cuiaba BR-163 (Cuiabá-Santarém excerpt).

The Núcleo de Colonização Celeste (Celeste Center for Settlement) belonged to Jorge Martins Phillip and had initial area of 198 000 hectares of land designated for settlement, being acquired in 1971 by Pipino. The opening of the first streets of Sinop began in May 1972 and the first families of pioneers soon arrived in the city. Back then, expeditions from Paraná to Sinop used to take about 7 days. But despite this great difficulty, the migratory flow towards the West that accompanied the indentation of the agricultural frontier in northern Mato Grosso grew increasingly. The project execution took place about 400 men and machines who crossed the Verde River and opened the first bites in the jungle.

The date of its foundation ended up being on September 14, 1974, and the acronym SINOP was adopted as the city's name (not to be confused with the ancient city in the province of [[Sinop, Turkey]] of the same name). Development was rapid and the largest number of migrants arrived in 1975. The city was already a real construction site, with more than 20 blocks, 1400&nbsp;km of local roads, experimental fields, community center, schools, infrastructure support to support new residents, Brazilians from all regions of the country.

On July 24, 1976, Governor José Garcia Neto signed the Law 3.754/76, rising Sinop to the rank of district of Chapada dos Guimarães. On December 17, 1979, the Governor  Frederico Campos signed Law 4.156/79, which raised Sinop to a municipality.
