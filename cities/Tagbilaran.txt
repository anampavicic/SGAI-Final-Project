'''Tagbilaran''', officially the '''City of Tagbilaran''' ({{langx|ceb|Dakbayan sa Tagbilaran}}; {{langx|hil|Dakbanwa sang Tagbilaran}}; {{langx|fil|Lungsod ng Tagbilaran}}), is a 3rd class [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|component city]] and capital of the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 104,976 people making it the most populous in the province.{{PH census|current}}

Encompassing a land area of {{convert|32.7|km2|abbr=on}}, with a coastline of {{convert|13|km|abbr=on}} on the southwestern part of the island, the city shares its boundaries with the towns of [[Cortes, Bohol|Cortes]], [[Corella, Bohol|Corella]], and [[Baclayon, Bohol|Baclayon]].

Tagbilaran is the principal gateway to Bohol, {{convert|630|km|abbr=on}} southeast of the national capital of [[Manila]] and {{convert|72|km|abbr=on}} south of the regional capital, [[Cebu City]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.valuealliance.com/en/flights/pvg/tag/shanghai-to-tagbilaran | title = ''Tagbiliran'' | publisher = Value Alliance | access-date = January 30, 2019}}</ref>

==Etymology==
According to oral tradition, the name is a [[Hispanicization|Hispanicized]] form of "''Tagubilaan''", a compound of ''tagu'', meaning "''to hide''" and "''Bilaan''", referring to the [[Blaan people]], who were said to have raided the [[Visayas|Visayan Islands]]. This explanation seems to correlate with the government's explanation. According to the official government website of Tagbilaran, it is said to have been derived from ''tinabilan'' meaning ''shielded'', as the town was protected by [[Panglao Island|Panglao]] from potential invaders.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tagbilaran.gov.ph/history/|title = History}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Landing Fields - Philippines - Bohol Island - NARA - 68160498.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of Tagbilaran, 1937]]
A hundred years before Spaniards arrived in the Philippines, the settlement which eventually became Tagbilaran was already involved in trading with China and Malaya. Tagbilaran Strait was the location of the Precolonial kingdom of the [[Kedatuan of Dapitan]]. This early settlement had contact with the Spaniards in 1565, when the Spanish conquistador [[Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi]] and the native chieftain [[Datu Sikatuna]] pledged peace and cooperation through the famous blood compact.

(San Jose de) Tagbilaran was established as a town on 9 February 1742, by General Don Francisco Antonio Calder√≥n de la Barca, Governor of the Visayas, who separated it from the town of [[Baclayon, Bohol|Baclayon]]. The town was dedicated to St. Joseph the Worker. Since then it was part of the province of Bohol until it became a chartered city on 18 July 1966, by virtue of Republic Act No. 4660.

The city was occupied by the [[United States]] during the [[Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War]] and by [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]] during [[World War II]].

'''Sitio Ubos''' (''Lower Town'') is Tagbilaran's former harbor site and is considered to be the city's oldest portion, having been a busy trading center since the seventeenth century until the early twentieth century. As such, the place houses the oldest and largest number of heritage houses in Bohol. Sitio Ubos declined as a major port towards the end of the Spanish era when the causeway to Panglao Island was constructed. Since then, the area lost its former glory and its old houses were either demolished or neglected.{{sfn|Akpenodu| Saloma|2011}}

In 2002, in recognition of its cultural and historic significance, Sitio Ubos was declared a "Cultural Heritage Area". Some of the surviving heritage houses to this day include the Rocha‚ÄìSuarez House, Rocha House, Hontanosas House, Beldia House, and Yap House.{{sfn|Akpenodu| Saloma|2011}}

===Historic events===

One of the most important events in [[Philippine history]] (immortalized on canvas by the famous Filipino painter [[Juan Luna]]) was the [[blood compact]] between [[Datu Sikatuna]], a local native chieftain, and Captain [[Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi]], the Spanish explorer and colonizer. It was believed that it took place in the coast of Bool, now a district of Tagbilaran, on 16 March 1565, a day after Legazpi and his crew of [[conquistador]]es on four ships chanced upon the shores of Bool during their trip to the province of [[Butuan]] from [[Camiguin]] Island because of strong southwest monsoon winds and low tide. 

But in March 2006, the National Historical Institute (now National Historical Commission of the Philippines) installed a stone marker with an iron plaque at Villalimpia, Hinawanan Bay, Loay, to rectify the error once and for all. The historical marker states that:

'''Ang Sandugo'''

''Sa look ng Hinawanan, Loay naganap ang sandugo sa pagitan nina Miguel Lopez de Legazpi at Datu Sikatuna ng Bohol sa loob ng barkong San Pedro ng Espanya, 25 Marso 1565. Isinagawa sa pamamagitan ng pag-inom ng alak na inihalo sa dugo mula sa hiwa sa dibdib ng dalawang pinuno. Naging simula ng pagkakaibigan ng mga Espanyol at mga Boholano at Kristiyanisasyon ng Pulo.''

Tagbilaran was occupied by Imperial Japanese forces on 17 May 1942, after the fall of the Philippines during World War II.

During the Japanese occupation, the municipal government of Tagbilaran, whose mayor at the time was Manuel Espuelas, moved from the Poblacion to Tiptip.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://nlpdl.nlp.gov.ph:81/HD01/p9/m31/b11/lgujpg.htm|title=Historical and Cultural Life of the Barrio of Tiptip|website=National Library of the Philippines Digital Library|access-date=January 21, 2017}}</ref> Another significant event was the Battle of Ubujan wherein a guerrilla unit under the command of Captain Francisco Salazar (aka Vicente Cubello) engaged Japanese troops against overwhelming odds.<ref>[http://www.tagbilaran.gov.ph/?page_id=9 History of Tagbilaran] Retrieved December 6, 2009.</ref>

===2013 earthquake===

An [[2013 Bohol earthquake|earthquake with magnitude 7.2]], with an epicenter near [[Sagbayan, Bohol]], struck Bohol on October 15, 2013. Tagbilaran received four fatalities and 21 injuries, and damage to buildings, including the seaport, airport, and city hall.

==Geography==
[[Image:Banat-i Hill.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Banat-i Hill bordering the end of Tagbilaran]]
Tagbiliran is shaped a strip with two hills, Elley Hull (100 meters) and Banat-i (145 meters), located on its southern and northern borders respectively.<ref>{{cite news |title=The City of Tagbilaran Fast Facts |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Slg1AAAAIBAJ&pg=PA6 |access-date=8 March 2024 |publisher=Philippine Daily Inquirer |date=1 July 2005 |language=en}}</ref>
