'''Lapu-Lapu City''', officially the '''City of Lapu-Lapu''' ({{lang-ceb|Dakbayan sa Lapu-Lapu}}; {{lang-fil|Lungsod ng Lapu-Lapu}}), is a [[Cities of the Philippines#Income classification|1st class]] [[Cities of the Philippines#Legal classification|highly urbanized city]] in the [[Central Visayas]] region of the [[Philippines]]. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 497,604.{{PH census|current}}

It was formerly known as '''Opon''', the city being renamed to its present name in 1961. It is one of the cities that make up [[Metro Cebu]] in the Philippines. It is located in the [[Provinces of the Philippines|province]] of [[Cebu]], administratively independent from the province, but grouped under Cebu by the [[Philippine Statistics Authority]] (PSA) and also the second most populous city of that province and in Central Visayas after the capital city of [[Cebu City|Cebu]].

The second busiest airport in the Philippines, [[Mactan–Cebu International Airport]], is located in Lapu-Lapu City. It opened in 1966 and serves as a hub for [[Philippine Airlines]], and as an operating base for [[Cebu Pacific]] and [[Philippines AirAsia]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-09-05 |title=Close up on the newly renovated Cebu airport—from Filipino art, tropical designs, and world-class awards |url=https://lifestyle.inquirer.net/515854/refreshing-the-mactan-cebu-international-airport/ |access-date=2024-11-04 |website=Lifestyle.INQ |language=en-US}}</ref>

==History==
[[File:Budots-media-2022-03-lapulapucity-lapulapumonument-mactan shrine.jpg|thumb|left|upright|220px|Lapulapu monument at the [[Mactan Shrine]]]]
In the 16th century, Mactan Island was colonized by Spain. [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] friars founded the town of '''Opon''' in 1730, and it became a city in 1961.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=LAPU-LAPU, CEBU |url=https://www.league.ph/items-9/-lapu-lapu,-cebu |access-date=2024-11-04 |website=League |language=en}}</ref> It was renamed after [[Datu]] [[Lapulapu]], the island's chieftain, who led the defeat against the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521 in the [[Battle of Mactan]],<ref name=":0" /> commemorated at [[Mactan Shrine]] in Barangay Mactan, where Magellan led a landing party of 40 men to resupply who were set upon by 1,500 locals and slew their captain and a few other men.

The municipality of Opon was founded by the Augustinian missionaries in 1730. It was ceded to the [[Jesuits]] in 1737, and later restored to the Augustinians. When the [[Philippine Revolution]] spread to the Visayas in 1898, the people organized themselves into local revolutionary units.

During the [[Filipino-American War]], a [[military government]] was established. The continued resistance of the people of Cebu prompted the American government to restore military control over the province on July 17, 1901. In 1905, Opon held its first municipal election, and Pascual dela Serna was elected town president.

Following the outbreak of [[World War II]], the presence of bulk oil storage tanks in Opon made the town an object of Japanese raids a week after the outbreak of WWII in December 1941.  The enemy aircraft succeeded in blowing up two of about fourteen oil storage tanks in Opon.  A unit of the [[Kawaguchi Detachment]] of the [[Japanese Imperial Forces]] landed on the east coast of Cebu on April 10, 1942.  Later, the resistance movement was organized by [[James M. Cushing|Colonel James M. Cushing]], leader of the southern and central units, and Harry Fenton of the northern unit of the Cebu Resistance Movement.

During the [[Battle of the Visayas]], Victor II operations of the American Division led by Major General [[William Howard Arnold (general)|William Arnold]] landed in Cebu on March 26, 1945, and subsequently liberated the province.

Historically, the city includes the site of the [[Battle of Mactan]].  On August 1, 1973, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 2060, President [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]] declared the site of the battle a national shrine; the preservation, restoration and/or reconstruction of which shall be under the supervision and control of the National Historical Commission in collaboration with the Department of Tourism.  Mactan is also the birthplace of [[Leonila Garcia|Leonila Dimataga-Garcia]], wife of Carlos P. Garcia, the fourth President of the Republic. Leonila Dimataga-Garcia was a relative of the wife of Lapu-Lapu City's former mayor Ernest Weigel Jr. (1992–2001, three terms) who was the richest mayor in Metro Cebu, with a net worth of ₱57 million in the early 2000s.

===Cityhood===
{{main|Cities of the Philippines}}
Congressman Manuel A. Zosa, the representative of the Sixth District of Cebu, sponsored the Bill converting the former municipality of Opon into the present day city of Lapu-Lapu.  This was the Republic Act 3134,<ref>Republic Act No. 3134, June 17, 1961, "An Act Creating the City Of Lapu-Lapu" [http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/thebookshelf/showdocs/2/20623 elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph]</ref> known as the City Charter of Lapu-Lapu, which was signed on June 17, 1961, by Philippine President [[Carlos P. Garcia]].  Lapu-Lapu was inaugurated on December 31, 1961, with Mariano Dimataga, the last municipal mayor, as the first city mayor.<ref>[http://www.lapulapucity.gov.ph/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=50&Itemid=147 About Lapu Lapu City]</ref>

Secretary [[Lucas Bersamin]] signed Proclamation No. 558 which declared June 17 a special [[public holiday]] to commemorate the city's 63rd charter anniversary. Republic Act 3134, the "City Charter of Lapu-Lapu" was signed on June 17, 1961, by [[Carlos P. Garcia]].<ref>{{cite news |last1= |first1= |title=Palace declares June 17 a holiday in Lapu-Lapu|url= https://qa.philstar.com/the-freeman/cebu-news/2024/06/03/2360013/palace-declares-june-17-holiday-lapu-lapu|access-date=June 2, 2024 |publisher= [[The Philippine Star]]|date=June 3, 2024}}</ref>

====Highly urbanized city====
On January 23, 2007, Lapu-Lapu was proclaimed as HUC via Proclamation No. 1222, signed by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]]. Its plebiscite was held along with [[Puerto Princesa]] in [[Palawan]] on July 21, 2007. Both of them successfully became highly urbanized cities after majority of their voters voted in favor of conversion. They ranked 31st and 32nd in the country.

==Geography==
Lapu-Lapu is bounded on the north by the main island of Cebu, to the west by [[Cebu City]] and [[Mactan Channel]], on the east by the [[Camotes Sea]], and on the south by the town of [[Cordova, Cebu|Cordova]].

The city occupies [[Mactan Island]], a few kilometers off the main [[Cebu#Cebu Island|island of Cebu]].  It also has some of the [[barangay]]s under its jurisdiction on the [[Olango Island Group]]. The city is linked to [[Mandaue]] on mainland Cebu by the [[Mactan-Mandaue Bridge]] and [[Marcelo Fernan Bridge]]s.

===Barangays===
Lapu-Lapu is politically subdivided into 30 [[barangay]]s. Each barangay consists of [[purok]]s and some have [[sitios]].

Lapu-Lapu City is part of [[Metro Cebu]], the second-most important metropolitan area in the Philippines. It has benefited from the economic rise of Cebu in the 1990s and 2000s, also known as [[Ceboom]].

[[Mactan–Cebu International Airport]], the primary airport serving Cebu, is located in the city. The airport has direct routes with international destinations, including [[East Asia|East]] and [[Southeast Asia]]. These connections have given way for tourism to emerge as a major part of the city's economy. Several resorts are located in the city, most of which are concentrated along the eastern coast of the island in the barangays of Marigondon, Maribago, Mactan, and Punta Engaño.

The city is home to several industrial zones, such as Mactan Export Processing Zone (MEPZ) and the Cebu Light Industrial Park (CLIP). Other large industries include: General Milling Company, one of the largest food companies in the Philippines; the Cebu Shipyard and Engineering Works, pioneered by Dad Cleland; and several oil companies, such as [[Royal Dutch Shell]].

==Transportation==

Lapu-Lapu City, positioned within the heart of [[Visayas]], has an expansive and efficient transportation network that facilitates convenient travel and logistics. This dynamic city is primarily connected to the mainland of [[Cebu]] through three major infrastructure projects: the [[Marcelo Fernan Bridge]], [[Mactan-Mandaue Bridge]], and the more recent addition of the [[Cebu–Cordova Link Expressway]]. These strategic connections traverse the sea channel separating the island of [[Mactan]], where Lapu-Lapu City is located, from the island of Cebu.

MCIA is the chief gateway serving the city of Cebu and the greater region of [[Central Visayas]] since its opening for civilian traffic in 1966. It hosts regular flights to numerous global destinations, particularly focusing on key cities in [[Asia]]. Some of these prominent destinations include [[Singapore]], [[Macau]], [[Hong Kong]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], and [[Taiwan]].
