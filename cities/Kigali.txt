'''Kigali''' ({{IPA|kin|ci.ɡɑ́.ɾi|link=yes}}) is the [[Capital (political)|capital]] and largest [[city]] of [[Rwanda]]. It is near the nation's geographic centre in a region of rolling hills, with a series of valleys and ridges joined by steep slopes. As a [[primate city]], Kigali is a relatively new city. It has been Rwanda's economic, cultural, and transport hub since it was founded as an administrative outpost in 1907, and became the capital of the country at independence in 1962, shifting focus away from [[Butare|Huye]].

In an area controlled by the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] from the 15th century, and then by [[German East Africa|the German Empire]] in the beginning of the 20th century, the city was founded in 1907 when [[Richard Kandt]], [[List of colonial residents of Rwanda|the colonial resident]], chose the site for his headquarters, citing its central location, views and security. Foreign merchants began to trade in the city during the German era, and Kandt opened some government-run schools for [[Tutsi]] Rwandan students. Belgium [[East African campaign (World War I)|took control]] of Rwanda and [[Burundi]] during World War I, forming the mandate of [[Ruanda-Urundi]]. Kigali remained the seat of colonial administration for Rwanda but Ruanda-Urundi's capital was at Usumbura (now [[Bujumbura]]) in Burundi and Kigali remained a small city with a population of just 6,000 at the time of independence.

Kigali grew slowly during the following decades. It was not initially directly affected by the [[Rwandan Civil War]] between government forces and the rebel [[Rwandan Patriotic Front]] (RPF), which began in 1990. However, in April 1994 Rwanda's President [[Juvénal Habyarimana]] was killed when his aircraft [[Assassination of Juvénal Habyarimana and Cyprien Ntaryamira|was shot down]] near Kigali. His death was followed by the Rwandan genocide against Tutsi, which killed over 1,000,000 Tutsi. The RPF resumed fighting, ending a cease-fire of more than a year. They gradually took control of most of the country and seized Kigali on 4 July 1994. Post-genocide Kigali has experienced rapid population growth, with much of the city rebuilt.

The city of Kigali is one of the five [[provinces of Rwanda]], with boundaries set in 2006. It is divided into three districts—[[Gasabo District|Gasabo]], [[Kicukiro District|Kicukiro]], and [[Nyarugenge District|Nyarugenge]]—which historically had control of significant areas of local governance. Reforms in January 2020 transferred much of the districts' power to the city-wide council. The city also hosts the main residence and offices of the [[president of Rwanda]] and most government ministries. The largest contributor to Kigali's [[gross domestic product]] is the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service sector]], but a significant proportion of the population works in agriculture including small-scale [[subsistence farming]]. Attracting international visitors is a priority for city authorities, including leisure tourism, conferences and exhibitions.

==Etymology==
The name Kigali comes from the [[Kinyarwanda]] prefix {{lang|rw|ki-}} combined with the adjective suffix {{lang|rw|-gali}}, which means wide or broad. This was originally applied to [[Mount Kigali]], most likely because the mountain itself was broad and wide, with the city later being named after the mountain.<ref name="cia._Rwan">{{Cite web |title=Rwanda |work=The World Factbook |publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]] |date=5 February 2021 |access-date=17 February 2021 |url= https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/countries/rwanda/}}</ref> According to Rwandan oral history, the name originated in the 14th century.<ref name="LegacyPart1"/> Rwandan scholar [[Alexis Kagame]], who did extensive research into the country's oral history and traditions,{{sfn|Vansina|2005|p=4}} wrote that the name Kigali came into use after King [[Cyilima I Rugwe]] completed a conquest of the area. The legend states that Rugwe viewed the territory from the top of a hill and said ''burya iki gihugu ni kigali'', which translates to "this country is vast".<ref name="LegacyPart1"/>

===Pre-colonial period===
<!--[[File:CentralKigali.jpg|thumb|right|Central Kigali]]
[[File:Suburb of Kigali with Mt Kigali in the background.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Kigali]] and one of the northern suburbs]]-->
The earliest inhabitants of what is now Rwanda were the [[Great Lakes Twa|Twa]], a group of aboriginal [[Pygmy peoples|pygmy]] hunter-gatherers who settled the area between 8000 and 3000&nbsp;BC and remain in the country today.{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=44}}{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}} They were followed between 700&nbsp;BC and AD&nbsp;1500 by a number of [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] groups, including the [[Hutu]] and [[Tutsi]], who began clearing forests for agriculture.{{sfn|Mamdani|2002|p=61}}{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=58}} According to oral history, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] was founded in the 14th century on the shores of [[Lake Muhazi]], around {{convert|40|km|mi}} east of modern Kigali.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=37}}{{sfn|Munyakazi|Ntagaramba|2005|p=18}}{{sfn|Prunier|1999|p=18}}<ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Rwanda Development Board]] |url=http://www.rwandatourism.com/destinations/muhazi |via=RwandaTourism.com |title=Muhazi |access-date=6 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325004516/http://www.rwandatourism.com/destinations/muhazi |archive-date=25 March 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The early kingdom included Kigali but it was a small state at this point in its history with larger and more powerful neighbours, [[Bugesera (kingdom)|Bugesera]] and [[Gisaka]].{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=6}}{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=158}}

A member of the Gisaka dynasty killed Rwanda's king [[Ruganzu I Bwimba]] in the 16th century, but Ruganzu's son Cyilima I Rugwe fought back with help from Bugesera and was able to expand Rwanda's territory.{{sfn|Streissguth|2007|pp=21–22}} In the late 16th or early 17th century, the kingdom of Rwanda was invaded from the north by the [[Banyoro]] of modern-day [[Uganda]].{{sfn|Streissguth|2007|pp=21–22}} The king was forced to flee westward, leaving Kigali and eastern Rwanda in the hands of Bugesera and Gisaka.{{sfn|Munyakazi|Ntagaramba|2005|p=18}}{{sfn|Chrétien|2003|p=158}} The formation of a new Rwandan dynasty in the 17th century by the ''mwami'' (king), [[Ruganzu II Ndoli]], followed by eastward invasions and the conquest of Bugesera, marked the beginning of the Rwandan kingdom's dominance in the area.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=39}} The capital of the kingdom was at [[Nyanza, Rwanda|Nyanza]], in the south of the country.{{sfn|Twagilimana|2015|p=175}}

The founding of Kigali is generally dated to 1907, when German administrator and explorer [[Richard Kandt]] was appointed as the first [[List of colonial residents of Rwanda|resident of Rwanda]], and established the city as the headquarters.{{sfn|Cybriwsky|2013|pp=140–141}}<ref name="48HoursInKigali"/><ref name="Centenary"/> Alexis Kagame promoted an alternative theory that the city was established as a capital under Cyilima I Rugwe in either the 1300s or the 1500s.

When Germany decided in 1907 to separate the administration of Rwanda from that of Burundi, Kandt was appointed as resident.{{sfn|Louis|1963|p=146}} He chose to make his headquarters in Kigali due to its central location in the country,<ref name="HistoryOfCity"/> and also because the site on Nyarugenge Hill afforded good views and security.<ref name="HistoryOfCity"/> Kandt's house, located close to the [[central business district]] (CBD), was the first European-style house in the city,<ref name="LegacyPart1"/> and remains in use today as the [[Kandt House Museum of Natural History]].<ref>{{cite web |publisher=National Museums of Rwanda |url=http://www.museum.gov.rw/2_museums/kigali/kandt_house/pages_html/intro/page_intro.htm |title=Institute of National Museums of Rwanda |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081209092050/http://www.museum.gov.rw/2_museums/kigali/kandt_house/pages_html/intro/page_intro.htm |archive-date=9 December 2008 |access-date=21 May 2020}}</ref> Despite a German ordinance written in 1905, which prohibited "non-indigenous natives" from entering Rwanda,{{sfn|Louis|1963|p=168}} Kandt began permitting the entry of foreign traders in 1908, which allowed commercial activity to begin in Rwanda.{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=46}}{{sfn|Louis|1963|p=168}} Kigali's first businesses were established by Greek and Indian merchants,{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=46}} with assistance from [[Baganda]] and [[Swahili people]].{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=103}} Items traded included cloth and beads.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=103}} Commercial activity was limited and there were only around 30 firms in the city by 1914.{{sfn|Louis|1963|p=172}} Kandt also opened government-run schools in Kigali, which began educating Tutsi students.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=110}}

Belgian forces [[East Africa Campaign (World War I)|took control]] of Rwanda and Burundi during [[World War I]], with Kigali being captured by the Northern Brigade led by Colonel [[Philippe Molitor]] on 6 May 1916.{{sfn|Stapleton|2013|p=164}} The Belgians were granted sovereignty by a [[League of Nations mandate]] in 1922, forming the mandatory territory of [[Ruanda-Urundi]].{{sfn|Prunier|1999|pp=25–26}} In early 1917, Belgium attempted to assert direct rule on the mandate, placing King Musinga under arrest and sidelining Rwandans in the judiciary.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=127}} In this period, Kigali was one of two provincial capitals, alongside [[Gisenyi]].{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=135}} An agricultural-labour shortage caused by the recruitment of locals to assist the European armies during the war, the plundering of food by soldiers, and torrential rains which destroyed crops, led to [[Rumanura famine|a severe famine]] at the start of the Belgian administration.{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|pp=137–138}} The famine, combined with the difficulty of governing the complex Rwandan society, prompted the Belgians to re-establish the German-style indirect rule at the end of 1917.{{sfn|Linden|Linden|1977|p=130}} Musinga was restored to his throne at Nyanza, with Kigali remaining home to the colonial administration.{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=142}}{{sfn|Dorsey|1994|p=275}} This arrangement persisted until the mid-1920s,{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=210}} but from 1924 the Belgians began once more to sideline the monarchy, this time permanently.{{sfn|Geary|2003|p=96}} Belgium took over control of dispute resolution, appointment of officials and collection of taxes.{{sfn|Des Forges|2011|p=210}}{{sfn|Stapleton|2017|p=34}} Kigali remained relatively small through the remainder of the colonial era, as much of the administration took place in Ruanda-Urundi's capital [[Usumbura]], now known as Bujumbura in Burundi.

[[File:Suburban Sprawl in Kigali.jpg|thumb|Kigali City Hall ''(right)''|alt=Panorama photograph showing buildings, car parks and a street with cars]]
Kigali is a province-level city, one of the five provinces of Rwanda. The area under the city's jurisdiction has been expanded several times since Rwandan independence,{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=1}} the current boundaries being established through a 2005 law as part of local-government restructuring. The law gave the city government responsibility for strategic planning and urban development, as well as liaising with the three constituent districts and monitoring the districts' development plans.<ref>{{cite web |publisher=Ministry of Local Government (Rwanda) |date=August 2007 |title=Rwanda Decentralization Strategic Framework |url=http://www.minecofin.gov.rw/webfm_send/2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329024025/http://www.minecofin.gov.rw/webfm_send/2014 |archive-date=29 March 2013 |access-date=1 May 2020}}</ref> Like other provinces, Kigali is divided into districts—Gasabo, Kicukiro, and Nyarugenge—which are in turn divided into 35 sectors.{{sfn|REMA|2013|p=11}}

===Crime and policing===
[[File:Police car in Rwanda.jpg|thumb|Rwanda National Police car on a Kigali street|alt=View of a police car following another car on a street.]]

In 2014–15, the [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people]] was 2.52 in the country, compared with 11.52 for Uganda, 6.95 for Tanzania, 4.79 for Kenya, and 4.52 for Burundi.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://dataunodc.un.org/crime/intentional-homicide-victims |title=Intentional Homicide Victims |publisher=[[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] |access-date=31 December 2020}}</ref>

Although the constitution allows [[freedom of assembly]], with protests and demonstrations allowed with a permit, such gatherings in Rwanda are rare. The US political freedom research institute [[Freedom House]] states that fear of arrest serves as a deterrent for most such protests, and that the police often disperse protests even when they have official permission.<ref name="OSAC"/><ref>{{cite web |publisher=[[Freedom House]] |title=Freedom in the World 2020: Rwanda |access-date=31 December 2020 |url=https://freedomhouse.org/country/rwanda/freedom-world/2020}}</ref> Those gatherings which do take place are mostly peaceful and crime-free.

In 2013, the government implemented significant changes in the country's public university system, intended to improve efficiency by removing duplicated courses of study and eliminating discrepancies in student assessment between the different schools. The previously independent Kigali institutions KHI, KIST, KIE and SFB were merged with three others from outside the city—the UNR, Nyagatare-based [[Umutara Polytechnic]] and Ruhengeri's [[Higher Institute of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry]]—creating the consolidated [[University of Rwanda]]. It has six constituent colleges,{{sfn|Lemarchand|Tash|2015|p=162}} spanning nine campuses, three of which are in Kigali. These are the Gikondo campus, which serves as the university's headquarters and is home to its business and economics programmes, the Nyarugenge campus on the former KIST site, which houses the sciences, architecture and engineering, and the Remera campus which covers medicine, nursing, dentistry and health sciences.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://admissions.ur.ac.rw/?q=node%2F13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507213846/https://admissions.ur.ac.rw/?q=node%2F13 |archive-date=7 May 2020 |access-date=7 May 2020 |publisher=[[University of Rwanda]] |title=Admissions – Information Centers}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ur.ac.rw/?UR-Campus-Distribution-of-Programmes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200507214001/https://ur.ac.rw/?UR-Campus-Distribution-of-Programmes |archive-date=7 May 2020 |access-date=7 May 2020 |publisher=[[University of Rwanda]] |title=UR Campus Distribution of Programmes}}</ref>

The Rwandan government has increased investment in the [[Transport in Rwanda|transport infrastructure of Rwanda]] since the 1994 genocide, with aid from the United States, European Union, Japan, China, and others. Kigali is the centre of the country's road network, with paved roads linking the city to most other major cities and towns in the country.{{sfn|African Development Bank|OECD|2006|p=439}} It is also connected by road to other countries in the [[East African Community]], namely Uganda, [[Tanzania]], Burundi and [[Kenya]], as well as to the eastern Congolese cities of [[Goma]] and [[Bukavu]]; the most important trade route for imports and exports is the road to the port of [[Mombasa]] via [[Kampala]] and Nairobi, which is known as the [[Northern Corridor]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Tancott |first=Glen |date=30 June 2014 |title=Northern corridor |work=Transport World Africa |url=http://www.transportworldafrica.co.za/2014/06/30/northern-corridor/ |access-date=26 October 2015 }}</ref> Within the city there was a total of {{convert|1017|km|mi}} of road in 2012, although only fourteen per cent of this was paved road and many of the unpaved sections were of poor quality and dangerous during rainfall.

===Power===
Kigali's electricity supply was, until the early 2000s, generated almost entirely from [[hydroelectric]] sources; power stations on Lakes [[Lake Burera|Burera]] and [[Lake Ruhondo|Ruhondo]] provided 90 per cent of Rwanda's electricity.{{sfn|World Resources Report|2011|p=3}} A combination of below average rainfall and human activity, including the draining of the [[Rugezi wetlands]] for cultivation and grazing, caused the two lakes' water levels to fall from 1990 onwards; by 2004 levels were reduced by 50 per cent, leading to a sharp drop in output from the power stations.{{sfn|World Resources Report|2011|p=5}} Coupled with this, demand had been increasing since the 1980s as the economy grew, particularly in Kigali.{{sfn|World Resources Report|2011|pp=3–4}} In 2003–04, the national electricity company was forced to reduce output from the power stations, necessitating widespread [[loadshedding]].{{sfn|World Resources Report|2011|pp=4–5}} As an emergency measure, the government installed [[diesel generator]]s north of the city; by 2006 these were providing 56 per cent of the country's electricity, but were very costly.{{sfn|World Resources Report|2011|p=5}} Power outages remained a frequent occurrence in the late 2010s.<ref name="newt_Rwf1">{{Cite web |title=Rwf17.6 billion power substation inaugurated |last=Bizimungu |first=Julius |work=[[The New Times (Rwanda)|The New Times]] |date=28 September 2018 |access-date=15 February 2021 |url= https://www.newtimes.co.rw/news/rwf176-billion-power-substation-inaugurated}}</ref> This prompted the government and national supplier [[Rwanda Energy Group]] to invest in a programme of new peat-fired, hydroelectric, and methane power stations across Rwanda as well as the construction and repair of power lines.<ref name="newt_Kiga">{{Cite web |title=Kigali to enjoy uninterrupted electricity supply – REG chief |work=[[The New Times (Rwanda)|The New Times]] |date=5 September 2017 |access-date=15 February 2021 |url= https://www.newtimes.co.rw/section/read/219267}}</ref> As of 2018, 82 per cent of Kigali's households had access to electricity, with the government targeting 100 per cent provision within seven years.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Electricity access in Rwanda quadrupled in the last 7 years as more households get connected |publisher=[[Rwanda Energy Group]] |date=1 January 2018 |access-date=15 February 2021 |url= https://www.reg.rw/media-center/news-details/news/electricity-access-in-rwanda-quadrupled-in-the-last-7-years-as-more-households-get-connected/}}</ref> Most of these households are supplied by Rwanda's [[wide area synchronous grid]], with only between 2 and 4 per cent of households in the three districts relying on off-grid access in 2020.<ref name="reg._Offg">{{Cite web |title=Offgrid |publisher=[[Rwanda Energy Group]] |date=April 2020 |access-date=15 February 2021 |url= https://www.reg.rw/what-we-do/access/offgrid/}}</ref>
