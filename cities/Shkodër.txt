Shkodër is regarded as the traditional capital of [[northern Albania]], also referred to as [[Ghegs|Gegëria]], and is noted for its arts, culture, religious diversity, and turbulent history among the [[Albanians]]. The architecture of Shkodër is particularly dominated by mosques and churches reflecting the city's high degree of religious diversity and tolerance. Shkodër was home to many [[List of people from Shkodër|influential personalities]], who among others, helped to shape the [[Albanian National Awakening|Albanian Renaissance]].

== Name ==

The city was first attested in classical sources as the capital of the Illyrian kingdom with the name ''Skodra'' ([[Ancient greek language|Ancient Greek]]: Σκόδρα; genitive {{lang|grc|Σκοδρινῶν}} "of the Skodrians", appearing on 2nd c. BCE coins) and ''Scodra'' ([[Latin Language|Latin]] form).<ref>{{cite book |last=Krahe |first=Hans |title=Die alten balkanillyrischen geographischen Namen auf Grund von Autoren und Inschriften |location=Heidelberg |year=1925 |page=36}}</ref><ref>e.g. [[Ptolemy]], ''[[Geography (Ptolemy)|Geographia]]'' II.16.; [[Polybius]], ''[[The Histories (Polybius)|Histories]]'', XXVII.8.</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=The Illyrians |first=John |last=Wilkes |isbn=0-631-19807-5 |year=1992 |pages=177–179|publisher=Wiley }}</ref>

Although the ultimate origin of the toponym Σκόδρα ''Scodra'' is uncertain,<ref name="Matzinger">{{harvnb|Matzinger|2009a|pp=22–24}}; Albanian translation: {{harvnb|Matzinger|2009b|pp=23–25}}.</ref> the name is certainly pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]]. A [[Paleo-Balkan languages|Paleo-Balkan]] origin has been suggested, relating it to the {{langx|sq|[[:en:Wiktionary:kodër|kodër]]}} ([[Definiteness|definite]] form: {{lang|sq|kodra}}) 'hill', and {{langx|ro|[[:en:Wiktionary:Codru|codru]]}} '(wooded) mountain, forest', with the same root as the ancient toponym ''[[Kodrion|Codrio/Kodrion]]''.<ref>{{cite book|last=Poruciuc|first=Adrian|title=Confluențe și etimologii|year=1998|publisher=Polirom|page=120|language=en|isbn=9789736830402|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xDNMAAAAMAAJ}}</ref>

The further development of the name has been a subject of discussion in Albanian historical linguistics. Some linguists treat the development from Illyrian ''Σκόδρα'' ''Skodra'' to Albanian ''Shkodra/Shkodër'' as evidence of regular development within the Albanian language. Others have argued that Albanian ''Shkodra/Shkodër'' fails to display certain known phonological changes that would have to have happened if the name had been continually in use in [[Proto-Albanian language|Proto-Albanian]] since pre-Roman times, based on the fact that ''*/sk-/'' consonant clusters are usually morphed into a ''*/h-/'', and not ''*/ʃk-/'', and ''o'' is morphed into ''a'', not preserved.<ref name="Matzinger"/><ref>{{cite journal |last=Cabej |first=Eqrem |year=1974 |title=Die Frage nach dem Entstehungsgebiet der albanischen Sprache |journal=Zeitschrift für Balkanologie |volume=1012 |pages=7–32}}; cited after Matzinger 2009.</ref><ref name=Sh.Demiraj>{{cite book |last=Demiraj |first=Shaban |title=Prejardhja e shqiptarëve nën dritën e dëshmive të gjuhës shqipe |location=Tirana |year=1999 |pages=143–144}}; cited after Matzinger 2009.</ref> However, the phonetic changes ''sk'' > ''h'' and ''o'' > ''a'' occurred at an early stage of Proto-Albanian, because they regularly do not involve early Greek and Latin loanwords. Contacts of Albanian with Greek date back as early as the 7th century BCE since the foundation of the Greek colonies on the Adriatic coast of Albania, hence those phonetic changes in Proto-Albanian certainly predate the foundation of Skodra (4th century BCE) and the usage of its name. On the other hand, the ''o'' in ''Shkodër'' would postdate first contacts with Latin, because in the earliest Latin loanwords in Albanian the ''ŏ'' is rendered as ''u''.{{sfn|Lafe|2022|pp=362–363, 366}} The preservation of ''ŏ'' in the Albanian form is to be explained probably because Latin was the predominant language of the Adriatic coastal areas, naturally exercising a significant pressure and influencing the linguistic forms of the local toponyms in Albanian. Similar cases of this process can be seen in the old Albanian toponym ''Trieshtë'', which evolved regularly through Albanian phonetic changes from ''[[Trieste]]'', but which was recently replaced in Albanian under strong pressure from Italian into the current name ''Trieste''; and the old Albanian toponym ''Gjenòvë'', which evolved regularly through Albanian phonetic changes form ''[[Genova]]'', also featuring the characteristic Albanian accent rule.{{sfn|Lafe|2022|pp=362–363, 366–368}} Nevertheless, the Albanian toponym ''Shkodër'' certainly predates the end of the ancient Roman period.{{sfn|Matzinger|2009b|pp=24–25}}<ref>{{Cite thesis|last=Curtis|first=Matthew Cowan|title=Slavic-Albanian Language Contact, Convergence, and Coexistence|url=https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=osu1338406907|publisher=The Ohio State University|year=2012|page=17|access-date=2023-01-29|archive-date=2023-02-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230207075619/https://etd.ohiolink.edu/apexprod/rws_etd/send_file/send?accession=osu1338406907|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Sh.Demiraj/><ref>Origins: Serbs, Albanians and Vlachs
Chapter 2 in Noel Malcolm's Kosovo, a short history (Macmilan, London, 1998, p. 22-40) - The evidence is in fact very mixed; some of the Albanian forms (of both urban and rural names) suggest transmission via Slav, but others -including the towns of Shkodra, Drisht, Lezha, Shkup (Skopje) and perhaps Shtip (Stip, south-east of Skopje) - follow the pattern of continuous Albanian development from the Latin. [48] (One common objection to this argument, claiming that 'sc-' in Latin should have turned into 'h-', not 'shk-' in Albanian, rests on a chronological error, and can be disregarded.) [49] There are also some fairly convincing derivations of Slav names for rivers in northern Albania - particularly the Bojana (Alb.: Buena) and the Drim (Alb.: Drin) - which suggest that the Slavs must have acquired their names from the Albanian forms. [50</ref>

In modern times, the term was adapted to Italian as ''Scodra'' ({{IPA|it|ˈskɔːdra}}) and ''Scutari'' ({{IPA|it|ˈskuːtari|}}); in this form it was also in wide use in English until the 20th century.<ref name=EB1911>[[Encyclopædia Britannica]], 11th edition (1911), "Scutari" article.</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} In [[Serbo-Croatian]], Shkodër is known as ''Skadar'' ({{Lang-sh-Cyrl|Скадар}}), and in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] as ''İşkodra''.

=== Early history ===

[[File:Rozafa Castle.jpg|thumb|left|View of the fortifications of [[Rozafa Castle]]]]

The earliest signs of human activity in the lands of Shkodër can be traced back to the [[Middle Paleolithic]] (120,000–30,000 years ago).{{sfn|Tafilica|Baze|Lafe|2023|p=68}} Artifacts and faunal remains provide evidence that the first inhabitants of the area of Shkodër were Pleistocene hunter-gatherers.{{sfn|Tafilica|Baze|Lafe|2023|p=69}} Presence of [[Neolithic]] farmers is also testified by artifacts. The [[Copper Age|Copper]] and Early [[Bronze Age|Bronze]] Ages constitute an important watershed for the social evolution on the territories of the eastern [[Adriatic]] coast, including Shkodër, with the formation of new cultures and the beginning of new complex historical, ethnogenetic and cultural processes. This period represents for Shkodër the first step of a process of occupation and development. The inhabitants of the intensively settled Shkodër basin produced pottery, practiced agriculture, and manufactured metal tools.{{sfn|Tafilica|Baze|Lafe|2023|p=69}} Shkodra's Early Bronze Age culture bears many similarities with the culture of the Eastern Adriatic coast and its hinterland, like the [[Cetina culture]], and it also has connections with the Early Bronze Age culture of [[Maliq]] in southeastern Albania. During the developed Early Bronze Age the new practice of [[tumulus]] burials appears, which may be associated to [[Indo-European migrations]] from the steppes. During the Middle and Late Bronze Age the settlements in the region and extraregional interactions apparently increased. In the Late Bronze Age the inhabitants of Shkodra basin had contacts with Italy or northwest Greece. By the end of the Bronze Age and the beginning of the Iron Age ({{circa}} 1100–800 BCE), the formation of a large, cohesive, and quite homogeneous cultural group had already occurred in a well defined territory of the Shkodra region, which was referred in historical sources to as 'the tribe of the [[Labeatae]]' in later times.{{sfn|Tafilica|Baze|Lafe|2023|p=70}}

The favorable conditions on the fertile [[plain]], around the [[lake]], have brought people here in early antiquity. Artefacts and inscriptions, discovered in the [[Rozafa Castle]], are assumed to be the earliest examples of symbolic behaviour in humans in the city. Although, it was known under the name Scodra and was inhabited by the [[Illyrian tribe]]s of the [[Labeates]] and [[Ardiaei]], which ruled over a large territory between modern Albania up to Croatia.<ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0233:book=28:chapter=8 Polybius]</ref><ref>[https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.02.0140:book=43:chapter=20 Titus Livius]</ref><ref>Encyclopædia Britannica 2002 page 680</ref> King [[Agron of Illyria|Agron]], Queen [[Teuta]] and King [[Gentius]], were among the most famous personalities of the [[Ardiaei]].

The city was first mentioned during antiquity as the site of the Illyrian Labeates in which they minted coins and that of Queen Teuta.<ref>''The Illyrians'' by John Wilkes, {{ISBN|0-631-19807-5}}, 1992, page 172, "...Gentius among the Labeates around Scodra..."</ref> In 168 BCE, the city was captured by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] and became an important trade and military route. The [[Roman Empire|Romans]] colonized<ref>The Illyrians by John Wilkes, page 213, "The list of Roman settlements includes some of the... Scodra..."</ref> the town. Scodra remained in the province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] and, later, [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]]. By it 395 CE, it was part of the [[Diocese of Dacia]], within [[Praevalitana]].
After the split of the Roman Empire, Shkodra was taken by the Byzantines.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ditët e mbrame të Turqisë në Shkodër ase Rrethimi i Qytetit 1912-1913|last=Rrota|first=Justin|publisher=Botime Françeskane|year=2010|isbn=9789995678371|location=Shkodër|pages=21|authorlink=Justin Rrota|origyear=1963}}</ref>

In the early 11th century, [[Jovan Vladimir]] ruled [[Duklja]] amidst the war between [[Basil II]] and Samuel. Vladimir allegedly retreated into [[Koplik]] when Samuel invaded Duklja and was subsequently forced to accept Bulgarian vassalage. He was later slain by the Bulgarians. Shingjon (feast of Jovan Vladimir) has since been celebrated by Albanian Orthodox Christians.<ref>Koti 2006, para. 1, 2</ref>

During the disintegration of the [[Serbian Empire]], Shkodër was taken by the Albanian [[Balshaj family]], who surrendered the city to the [[Republic of Venice]] in 1396, in order to form a protection zone from the [[Ottoman Empire]]. During the Venetian rule the city adopted the [[Statutes of Scutari]], a civic law written in [[Venetian language|Venetian]]. The [[Statutes of Scutari]] mention [[Albanians|Albanian]] and [[Slavs|Slavic]] presence in the city, but under [[Venetian Albania|Venetian rule]] many [[Dalmatian Italians|Dalmatians]] were brought to Shkodra and as such formed the majority there. After the [[Black Death]] killed most of the inhabitants Albanians and Slavs formed the majority in the city.<ref>{{Cite book |last=(Albania) |first=Shkodër |url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/723724243 |title=Statutet e Shkodrës : në gjysmën e parë të shekullit XIV me shtesat deri më 1469 = Statuti di Scutari della prima metà del secolo XIV con le addizioni fino al 1469 |date=2010 |publisher=Shtëpia Botuese Onufri |isbn=978-99956-87-36-6 |oclc=723724243}}</ref> Venetians built the ''St. Stephen's Church'' (later converted into the [[Fatih Sultan Mehmet Mosque]] by the Ottomans) and the [[Rozafa Castle]]. In 1478-79 Mehmed the conqueror laid siege on Shkodër. In 1479 the city fell to the Ottomans and the defenders of the citadel emigrated to Venice, while many Albanians from the region retreated into the mountains. On the other hand the upper classes of the city, aided by the [[Jonima family]] settled in the cities of [[Ravena]], [[Venice]] and [[Treviso]]. The city then became a seat of a newly established Ottoman sanjak, the Sanjak of Scutari.

With two [[Siege of Shkodra|siege]]s, Shkodër became secure as an Ottoman territory. It became the centre of the [[sanjak]] and by 1485 there were 27 Muslim and 70 Christian hearths, although by the end of the next century there were more than 200 Muslim ones compared to the 27 Christian ones, respectively.<ref>Clayer, Nathalie. " Is̲h̲ḳodra." Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition. Brill Online, 2012. Reference. 2 January 2012 <http://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-2/ishkodra-SIM_8713></ref>

Military manoeuvres in 1478 by the Ottomans meant that the city was again entirely surrounded by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] forces. [[Mehmed II]] personally laid [[Siege of Shkodra (1478)|the siege]]. About ten heavy cannons were cast on site. Balls as heavy as {{cvt|380|kg|0}} were fired on the citadel (such balls are still on display on the castle museum). Nevertheless, the city resisted. Mehmed left the field and had his commanders continue the siege. By the winter the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] had captured one after the other all adjacent castles: [[Lezhë]], [[Drisht]] and [[Žabljak Crnojevića]]. This, together with famine and constant bombardment lowered the morale of defenders. On the other hand, the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] were already frustrated by the stubborn resistance. The castle is situated on a naturally protected hill and every attempted assault resulted in considerable casualties for the attackers. A truce became an option for both parties. On January 25 an agreement between the Venetians and the [[Ottoman Empire]] ended the siege, permitting the citizens to leave unharmed, and the Ottomans to take over the deserted city.

After Ottoman domination was secure, much of the population fled. Around the 17th century, the city began to prosper as the centre of the [[Sanjak of Scutari]] ([[sanjak]] was an Ottoman administrative unit smaller than a [[Administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire|vilayet]]). It became the economic centre of northern Albania, its craftsmen producing fabric, silk, arms and silver artifacts. Construction included two-storey stone houses, the [[bazaar|souk]], and the Central or Middle Bridge (''Ura e Mesit'') over the Kir river, built during the second half of the 18th century, over {{cvt|100|m}} long, with 13 arcs of stone, the largest one being {{cvt|22|m}} wide and {{cvt|12|m}} tall.
[[File:Shkodër Cathedral construction.jpg|thumb|left|The construction of the [[St. Stephen's Cathedral, Shkodër|Cathedral of Shkodër]] in 1867]]
Shkodër was a major city under Ottoman rule in southeast Europe. It retained its importance up until the end of the empire's rule in the Balkans in the early 20th century. This is due to its geo-strategic position that connects it directly with the [[Adriatic]] and with the Italian ports, but also with land-routes to the other important Ottoman centre, namely [[Prizren]]. The city was an important meeting place of diverse cultures from other parts of the Empire, as well as influences coming westwards, by Italian merchants. It was a centre of [[Islam]] in the region, producing many [[ulema|ulama]], poets and administrators, particularly from the [[Bushati]] family.
In the 18th century Shkodër became the centre of the ([[Administrative divisions of the Ottoman Empire|pashaluk]]) of Shkodër, under the rule of the [[Bushati]] family, which ruled from 1757 to 1831. 

Shkodër's importance as a trade centre in the second half of the 19th century was owed to the fact that it was the centre of the [[vilayet of Shkodër]], and an important trading centre for the entire Balkan peninsula. It had over 3,500 shops, and clothing, leather, tobacco and gunpowder were some of the major products of Shkodër. A special administration was established to handle trade, a trade court, and a directorate of postage services with other countries. Other countries had opened consulates in Shkodër ever since 1718. [[Obot]] and [[Ulcinj]] served as ports for Shkodër, and, later on, [[Shëngjin]] (''San Giovanni di Medua''). The [[Jesuit]] seminary and the [[Franciscan]] committee were opened in the 19th century.

Following the rebellion of [[Mustafa Pasha Bushatli|Mustafa Pasha Bushatlliu]] Shkodër was sieged by the Ottomans for more than six months who finally managed to break the Albanian resistance on 10 November 1831. In 1833 around 4,000 Albanian rebels seized the town again holding off the Ottoman forces between April and December and even sending a delegation to Istanbul until the Ottoman government finally gave in to their terms giving an end to the rebellion.

Before 1867 Shkodër (İşkodra) was a [[sanjak]] of [[Rumelia Eyalet]] in [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1867, Shkodër sanjak merged with [[Skopje]] (Üsküp) sanjak and became [[Shkodër vilayet]]. Shkodër vilayet was split into Shkodër, [[Prizren]] and [[Sanjak of Dibra|Dibra]] sanjaks. In 1877, Prizren passed to [[Kosovo vilayet]] and [[Debar]] passed to [[Monastir vilayet]], while [[Durrës]] township became a sanjak. In 1878 [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] and [[Podgorica]] townships belonged to [[Montenegro]]. Ottoman-Albanian intellectual [[Sami Frashëri]] during the 1880s estimated the population of Shkodër as numbering 37,000 inhabitants that consisted of three quarters being Muslims and the rest Christians made up of mostly Catholics and a few hundred Orthodox.<ref name="Gawrych29217">{{cite book |last=Gawrych |first=George |title=The Crescent and the Eagle: Ottoman rule, Islam and the Albanians, 1874–1913 |year=2006 |location=London |publisher=IB Tauris |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wPOtzk-unJgC&q=The+crescent+and+the+eagle:+Ottoman+rule,+Islam+and+the+Albanians,+1874-1913+lexicon |isbn=9781845112875 |pages=29, 217}}</ref> In 1900, Shkodër vilayet was split into Shkodër and [[Durrës]] sanjaks.

[[File:BASA-3K-7-411-113-First Balkan War.jpg|thumb|230px|Shkodër during the [[First Balkan War]]]]

Shkodër played an important role during the [[League of Prizren]], the Albanian liberation movement. The people of Shkodër participated in battles to protect Albanian land. The branch of the League of Prizren for Shkodër, which had its own armed unit, fought for the protection of [[Plav, Montenegro|Plav]], [[Gusinje]], [[Hoti (Albanians)|Hoti]] and [[Gruda (region)|Gruda]], and the war for the protection of Ulcinj. The Bushati Library, built during the 1840s, served as a centre for the League of Prizren's branch for Shkodër. Many books were collected in libraries of [[Catholic]] missionaries working in Shkodër. Literary, cultural and sports associations were formed, such as [[Shoqnia Bashkimi|''Bashkimi'' ("The Union")]] and [[Agimi (society)|''Agimi'' ("The Dawn")]]. The first Albanian newspapers and publications printed in Albania came out of the printing press of Shkodër. The Marubi family of photographers began working in Shkodër, which left behind over 150,000 negatives from the period of the Albanian liberation movement, the rise of the Albanian flag in [[Vlorë]], and life in Albanian towns during the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century.

During the [[Balkan Wars]], Shkodër went from one occupation to another, when the Ottomans were defeated by the [[History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]]. The Ottoman forces led by [[Hasan Riza Pasha]] and Esad Pasha had resisted for seven months the siege of the town by Montenegrin forces and their Serbian allies. [[Mehmet Esat Bülkat|Esad]] (Hasan had previously been mysteriously killed by [[Essad Toptani]] in an ambush inside the town) finally surrendered to Montenegro in April 1913, after Montenegro suffered a high death toll with more than 10,000 casualties. [[Edith Durham]] also notes the cruelties suffered at the hand of Montenegrins in the wake of October 1913: "Thousands of refugees arriving from Djakovo and neighbourhood. Victims of Montenegro. My position was indescribably painful, for I had no funds left, and women came to me crying: 'If you will not feed my child, throw it in the river. I cannot see it starve.'"<ref>Twenty Years of Balkan Tangle: M. [[Edith Durham]]</ref> Montenegro was compelled to leave the city to the new country of [[Albania]] in May 1913, in accordance with the [[London Conference of 1913|London Conference]] of Ambassadors.

During [[World War I]], Montenegrin forces again occupied Shkodër on 27 June 1915. In January 1916, Shkodër was taken over by [[Austria-Hungary]] and was the centre of the zone of their occupation. When the war ended on 11 November 1918, French forces occupied Shkodër as well as other regions with sizable Albanian populations. After World War I, the international military administration of Albania was temporarily located in Shkodër, and in March 1920, Shkodër was put under the administration of the national government of Tirana. In the second half of 1920, during the [[Koplik War|Serbian-Albanian War]], Shkodër resisted the Serbian invasion under the lead of [[Bushati|Sylço Bushati]] and financial aid provided by notable figures such as [[Musa Juka]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Lebenserinnerungen|Kujtime 1885-1925]]|last=Vlora|first=Eqrem bej|publisher=IDK|year=2003|isbn=99927-780-6-7|location=Tiranë|pages=456}}</ref>

Shkodër was the centre of democratic movements of the years 1921–1924. The democratic opposition won the majority of votes for the Constitutional Assembly, and on 31 May 1924, the democratic forces took over the town and from Shkodër headed to Tirana. From 1924 to 1939, Shkodër had a slow industrial development, small factories that produced food, textile and cement were opened. From 43 of such in 1924, the number rose to 70 in 1938. In 1924, Shkodër had 20,000 inhabitants, the number grew to 29,000 in 1938. During September 1928, Albania was proclaimed a monarchy by [[Zog I of Albania|King Zog I]]. He was a self-made Muslim monarch and the king of all Albanians until 1939 when Italy invaded Albania, Shkoder resisted under the lead of Mehmet Ullagaj but fell soon afterwards.<ref name=":03">{{Cite book|title=Shkodranët e 7 prillit dhe të 29 nëntorit|last=Juka|first=Gëzim H.|publisher=Reklama|year=2018|isbn=9789928440358|location=Tiranë|pages=20, 22}}</ref> After 1939, Zog went into exile and [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy|Victor Emmanuel III]] became the king of the Albanians. Shortly after World War II, Emmanuel was formally abdicated in 1946. In 1945, [[Enver Hoxha]] established communism in Albania.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Tomes |first=Jason |title=King Zog of Albania : Europe's Self-Made Muslim Monarch |publisher=New York University Press |year=2003 |isbn=0-8147-8283-3 |location=New York, NY |pages=100–233 |language=English}}</ref>

Shkodër was the seat of a [[Catholic]] [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Shkodër-Pult|archbishopric]] and had a number of religious schools. The first laic school was opened here in 1913, and the State Gymnasium was opened in 1922. It was the centre of many cultural associations. In sports Shkodër was the first city in Albania to constitute a sports association, the "Vllaznia" (brotherhood). [[Vllaznia Shkodër]] is the oldest sport club in Albania.

During the early 1990s, Shkodër was once again a major centre, this time of the democratic movement that finally brought to an end the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist]] regime established by [[Enver Hoxha]]. In the later 2000s (decade), the city experiences a rebirth as main streets are being paved, buildings painted and streets renamed. In December 2010, Shkodër and the surrounding region was hit by probably the worst flooding in the last 100 years.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11931554 |work=BBC News |title=Nato joins Albania rescue effort after Balkan floods |date=6 December 2010}}</ref> In 2011, a new [[swing bridge]] over the Buna was constructed, thus replacing the old bridge nearby.

[[Lake Shkodër]] lies in the west of the city and forms the frontier of [[Albania]] and [[Montenegro]]. The lake became the symbol of the stable and consistent economic and social divide of the city. Although, the lake is the largest lake in [[Southern Europe]] and an important habitat for various [[animal]] and [[plant]] species. Further, the Albanian section has been designated as a [[nature reserve]]. In 1996, it also has been recognised as a [[wetland]] of international importance by designation under the [[Ramsar Convention]].<ref name="Ramsar">{{cite web |url=http://www.ramsar.org/pdf/sitelist.pdf |title=The list of wetlands of international importance |last=Ramsar |date=August 4, 2010 |publisher=Ramsar |page=5 |language=en, es|access-date=14 August 2010}}</ref> Buna connects the lake with the Adriatic Sea, while the Drin provides a link with [[Lake Ohrid]] in the southeast of Albania.<ref name="Pešić 2013">Pešić V. & Glöer P.
