'''Limpopo''' ({{IPAc-en|l|I|m|'|p|ou|p|ou}}) is the northernmost [[Provinces of South Africa|province]] of [[South Africa]]. It is named after the [[Limpopo River]], which forms the province's western and northern borders. The term Limpopo is derived from Rivombo (Livombo/Lebombo), a group of Tsonga settlers led by Hosi Rivombo who settled in the mountainous vicinity and named the area after their leader. The Lebombo mountains are also named after them. The river has been called the Vhembe by local Venda communities of the area.<ref>{{cite web|title=Limpopo Province – An Overview|url=http://www.dolimpopo.com/limpopo-province|website=dolimpopo.com|access-date=20 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201235654/http://www.dolimpopo.com/limpopo-province|archive-date=1 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> The capital and largest city in the province is [[Polokwane]], while the provincial legislature is situated in [[Lebowakgomo]].

The province is made up of three former homelands of [[Lebowa]], [[Gazankulu]] and [[Venda]] and part of the former [[Transvaal (province)|Transvaal]] province. The Limpopo province was established as one of nine provinces after the [[1994 South African general election]]. The province's name was first "Northern Transvaal", later changed to "Northern Province" on 28 June 1995, with two other provinces. The name was later changed again in 2002 to the Limpopo Province. Limpopo is made up of three main ethnic groups: the [[Pedi people|Pedi]], the [[Tsonga people|Tsonga]] and the [[Venda people|Venda]].

Traditional leaders and chiefs still form a strong backbone of the province's political landscape. Established in terms of the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders Act, Act 5 of 2005, the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders' main function is to advise the government and the legislature on matters related to custom, tradition, and culture, including developmental initiatives that affect rural communities. On 18 August 2017, Kgosi Malesela Dikgale was re-elected as the Chairperson of the Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders.<ref name="gov.za">{{Cite web|title=Premier Stanley Mathabatha opens Limpopo House of Traditional Leaders, 26 Apr {{!}} South African Government|url=https://www.gov.za/speeches/premier-stanley-mathabatha-opens-limpopo-house-traditional-leaders-26-apr-24-apr-2019-0000#:~:text=For%20media%20interviews%20kindly%20contact,Leader%20on%20076%20202%207144.|access-date=16 August 2020|website=www.gov.za}}</ref>

[[File:Limpopo Mountain Sundown.jpg|thumb|left|Sundown over one of the mountain ranges found in Limpopo.]]
Limpopo Province shares international borders with districts and provinces of three countries: [[Botswana]]'s [[Central District (Botswana)|Central]] and [[Kgatleng District|Kgatleng]] districts to the west and northwest respectively, [[Zimbabwe]]'s [[Matabeleland South]] and [[Masvingo (province)|Masvingo]] provinces to the north and northeast respectively, and [[Mozambique]]'s [[Gaza Province]] to the east.<ref>{{cite web|title=Minister Dlamini to conduct two-day Ministerial visit in Vhembe|url=http://www.gov.za/news/media-advisories/government-activities/minister-bathabile-dlamini-conducts-ministerial-visit|date=February 4, 2014|website=[[Government of South Africa]]|access-date=21 December 2017|archive-date=April 1, 2024|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20240401101433/http://www.gov.za/news/media-advisories/government-activities/minister-bathabile-dlamini-conducts-ministerial-visit|url-status=live}}</ref> Limpopo is the link between South Africa and countries further afield in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

The province is central to regional, national, and international developing markets.

Limpopo contains much of the [[Waterberg Biosphere]], a [[massif]] of approximately {{convert|15000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} which is the first region in the northern part of South Africa to be named a UNESCO [[Biosphere Reserve]].<ref name="Hogan">C.

==Economy==
[[File:Toka Hlongwane (11).jpg|thumb|Man and his donkeys collecting wood in a rural area]]
Limpopo has a total population of 6.015 million with 1.641 million households.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=2 December 2021|title=STATISTICAL RELEASE P0318: General Household Survey 2020|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0318/P03182020.pdf|url-status=live|website=www.statssa.gov.za |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230606070331/http://www.statssa.gov.za/publications/P0318/P03182020.pdf |archive-date=6 June 2023}}</ref>  The province has a relatively high Human Development Index (HDI) of 0.710, which is the third highest in South Africa.

===Agriculture===
The bushveld is [[beef cattle]] country, where extensive ranching operations are often supplemented by controlled hunting. About 80% of South Africa's [[game hunting]] industry is in Limpopo.
 
[[Sunflower]]s, [[cotton]], [[maize]] and [[peanut]]s are cultivated in the [[Bela-Bela]] and [[Modimolle]] areas. Modimolle is also known for its table [[grape]]s. An embryotic [[South African wine|wine industry]] is growing in Limpopo.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.news24.com/citypress/business/sas-first-water-sommelier-candice-jansen-is-testing-the-waters-20220217|title = SA's first water sommelier, Candice Jansen, is testing the waters}}</ref> Tropical fruit, such as [[banana]]s, [[lychee|litchis]], [[pineapple]]s, [[mango]]es and [[papaya|pawpaw]]s, as well as a variety of [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], are grown in the [[Tzaneen]] and [[Louis Trichardt]] areas. Tzaneen is also at the centre of extensive [[citrus]], [[tea]], and [[coffee]] plantations and a major [[forestry]] industry. Most of the farmers and households lack a water supply which makes them drill boreholes on their premises.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Molele |first1=Charles |title=Cultivating agri-business in Limpopo |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2016-11-25-00-cultivating-agri-business-in-limpopo/ |access-date=12 August 2020 |newspaper=Mail & Guardian |date=25 November 2016}}</ref>

===Housing===
Most Limpopo residents live in rural areas; this has led to a new phenomenon of rural development, where the residents have invested in building lavish homes on their tribal land. Limpopo rural houses have been profiled by TV channels, lifestyle vloggers, social media influencers, and Africa's biggest facts brand, Africa Facts Zone. According to <ref name=":0" /> 96.2% of Limpopo live in formal housing, above the national average of 84.0%. This makes Limpopo the province with the highest percentage of people living in formal housing in South Africa.

===Mining===

Scale at bottom is one inch, with a rule at one cm.{{citation needed|reason=there are 2.5&nbsp;cm to an inch and the dimensions presented don't add up|date=December 2012}}]]
Limpopo's rich mineral deposits include the platinum group metals, iron ore, chromium, high- and middle-grade [[coking coal]], diamonds, [[antimony]], [[phosphate]], and copper, as well as mineral reserves like gold, emeralds, [[scheelite]], [[magnetite]], [[vermiculite]], [[silicon]], and [[mica]]. Commodities such as [[black granite]], [[corundum]], and [[feldspar]] are also found. Mining contributes to over a fifth of the provincial economy.

===Tourism===
The Limpopo Department of Economic Development, Environment and Tourism has targeted the province as a preferred [[eco-tourism]] destination. Its Environment and Tourism Programme encompasses tourism, protected areas, and community environment development to achieve sustainable economic growth.<ref name="search.gov.za">http://www.search.gov.za/info/previewDocument.jsp?dk=/data/static/info/speeches/2010/10040713351001.htm@Gov&q=%3Cphrase%3E+Issued+by:+Department...&t=P+Moloto:+Limpopo+Economic+Development+Environment+and+Tourism+Prov+Budget+Speech+2010/11 {{dead link|date=December 2017}}</ref>
